Remorse will ever seem commonplace alongside the\r\nfuries. Ever and always the shadow of the supernatural invites, pursues\r\nus. As the art of literature has progressed it has grown along with it.\r\nTo-day there is a whole new school of writers of Ghost-Stories, and the\r\ndomain of the invisible is being invaded by explorers in many paths. We\r\ndo not believe so much more, perhaps, that is, we do not so openly\r\nexpress a belief, but art has finally and frankly claimed the\r\nsupernatural for its own. One discerning authority even goes so far as\r\nto assert that the borders of its domain will be greatly enlarged in the\r\nwonderful new field of the screen.\r\n\r\nThere is no motive in a story, no image in poetry, that can give us\r\nquite the thrill of a supernatural idea. If we were formally charged\r\nwith this we might resent the imputation, but the evidence has persisted\r\nfrom the beginning, lives on every hand, and multiplies daily. What we\r\nhave been in the habit of calling the \"machinery\" of the old Greek\r\ndrama--its supernatural effects--has come finally to be an art\r\ncultivated with care at the present hour, and has given us some\r\nwonderful new writers. In fact, few of the best masters for a generation\r\nnow have been able to resist its persistent and abiding charm. Every\r\nwriter of true imagination, almost without exception, including even\r\ncertain realists, has given us at least one story, long or short, in\r\nwhich the central motive is purely psychical in the Greek sense of the\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject opens up a virgin field which has after all only begun\r\nto be tilled. Within the coming generation we may look for great artists\r\nto devote their whole powers to it, as Algernon Blackwood is doing\r\nto-day. A simple underlying reason is enough to account for it all--_the\r\nnew field imposes simply no limit on the imagination_. In addition to\r\nall that science has taught us, there is illimitable store of myth and\r\nlegend to aid, to draw from, to work in, to work over, as Lord Dunsany\r\nhas shown us. It is the most significant movement in literature at the\r\npresent hour, and whether it is supported by a special background of\r\ninterest--as at present in spiritism--or not, the assertion is logical\r\nthat it is creating a new body of fictional literature of permanent\r\nimportance for the first time in the history of literature. The human\r\ncomedy seems to have been exploited to its final limits; as the art of\r\nthe novel, the art of the stage, but too sadly prove to-day. We have\r\nturned outward for new thrills to the supernatural and we are getting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to be added that the present great interest in\r\nspiritualism and allied phenomena has made necessary the addition of\r\ncertain material of a \"literal\" character which we believe will be found\r\nquite as interesting by the general reader as the purely literary\r\nportion of the book.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH LEWIS FRENCH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE _Joseph Lewis French_\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION _Dorothy Scarborough_\r\n\r\nWHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG _Jack London_\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN _Algernon Blackwood_\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND GENERATION _Algernon Blackwood_\r\n\r\nJOSEPH--A STORY _Katherine Rickford_\r\n\r\nTHE CLAVECIN--BRUGES _George Wharton Edwards_\r\n\r\nLIGEIA _Edgar Allan Poe_\r\n\r\nTHE SYLPH AND THE FATHER _Elsa Barker_\r\n\r\nA GHOST _Lafcadio Hearn_\r\n\r\nTHE EYES OF THE PANTHER _Ambrose Bierce_\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHING INVISIBLE BEINGS _William T.

Prince_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHIC IN LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nWar, that relentless disturber of boundaries and of traditions in a\r\nspiritual as well as a material sense, has brought a tremendous revival\r\nof interest in the life after death and the possibility of communication\r\nbetween the living and the dead. As France became nearer to millions\r\nover here because our soldiers lived there for a few months, as French\r\nsoil will forever be holy ground because our dead rest there, so the far\r\ncountry of the soul likewise seems nearer because of those young\r\nadventurers. The conflict which changed the map of Europe has in the\r\nminds of many effaced the boundaries between this world and the world\r\nbeyond. Winifred Kirkland, in her book, _The New Death_, discusses the\r\nnew concept of death, and the change in our standards that it is making.\r\n\"We are used to speaking of this or that friend's philosophy of life;\r\nthe time has now come when every one of us who is to live at peace with\r\nhis own brain must possess also a philosophy of death.\" This New Death,\r\nshe says, is so far mainly an immense yearning receptivity, an\r\nunprecedented humility of brain and of heart toward all implications of\r\nsurvival. She believes that it is an influence which is entering the\r\nlives of the people as a whole, not a movement of the intellectuals, nor\r\nthe result of psychical research propaganda, but arising from the\r\nsimple, elemental emotions of the soul, from human love and longing for\r\nreassurance of continued life.\r\n\r\n\"If a man die, shall he live again?\" has been propounded ever since\r\nJob's agonized inquiry. Now numbers are asking in addition, \"Can we have\r\ncommunication with the dead?\" Science, long derisive, is sympathetic to\r\nthe questioning, and while many believe and many doubt, the subject is\r\none that interests more people than ever before. Professor James Hyslop,\r\nSecretary of the American Society for Psychical Research, believes that\r\nthe war has had great influence in arousing new interest in psychical\r\nsubjects and that tremendous spiritual discoveries may come from it.\r\n\r\nLiterature, always a little ahead of life, or at least in advance of\r\ngeneral thinking, has in the more recent years been acutely conscious of\r\nthis new influence. Poetry, the drama, the novel, the short story, have\r\ngiven affirmative answer to the question of the soul's survival after\r\ndeath. No other element has so largely entered into the tissue of recent\r\nliterature as has the supernatural, which now we meet in all forms in\r\nthe writings of all lands. And no aspect of the ghostly art is more\r\nimpressive or more widely used than the introduction of the spirit of\r\nthe dead seeking to manifest itself to the living. No thoughtful person\r\ncan fail to be interested in a theme which has so affected literature as\r\nhas the ghostly, even though he may disbelieve what the Psychical\r\nResearchers hold to be established.\r\n\r\nMan's love for the supernatural, which is one of the most natural things\r\nabout him, was never more marked than now. Man's imagination, ever\r\nvaster than his environment, overleaps the barriers of time and space\r\nand claims all worlds as eminent domain, so that literature, which he\r\nhas the power to create, as he cannot create his material surroundings,\r\npossesses a dramatic intensity and an epic sweep unknown in actuality.\r\nLiterature shows what humanity really is and longs to be. Man, feeling\r\nbelittled by his petty round of uninspiring days, longs for a larger\r\nlife. He yearns for traffic with immortal beings that can augment his\r\nwisdom, that can bring comfort to his soul dismayed and bewildered by\r\nlife. He reaches out for a power beyond his puny strength. Aware how\r\nrelentlessly time ticks away his little hour, he craves companionship\r\nwith the eternal spirits. Ignorant of what lies before him in the life\r\nto which he speeds so fast, he would take counsel of those who know,\r\nwould ask about the customs of the country where presently he will be a\r\ncitizen. He feels so terribly alone that he cries out like a child in\r\nthe dark for supermortal companionship.\r\n\r\nLiterature, which is both a cause and an effect of man's interest in the\r\nsupernatural as in anything else, reflects his longings and records his\r\ncries. And when we read the imaginings of the different generations, we\r\nfind that the spirit of the dead is represented almost everywhere.\r\nBefore poetry and fiction were recorded, there were singers and\r\nstory-tellers by the fire to give to their listeners the thrill that\r\ncomes from art. And what thrill is comparable to that which comes from\r\ncontact with the supermortal? The earliest literature relates the\r\nappearance of the spirits of those who have died as coming back to\r\ncomfort or to take vengeance on the living, but always as sentient,\r\nintelligent, and with an interest in the earth they have left. All\r\nthrough the centuries the wraith has survived in literature, has flitted\r\npallidly across the pages of poetry, story and play, with a sad\r\nwistfulness, a forlorn dignity.\r\n\r\nA double relation exists between the literature and the records of the\r\nPsychical Research Society. Lacy Collison-Morley, in his _Greek and\r\nRoman Ghost Stories_, speaks of the similarity between ancient tales of\r\nspirits and records of recent instances. \"There are in the Fourth Book\r\nof _Gregory the Great's Dialogues_ a number of stories of the passing of\r\nsouls which are curiously like some of those collected by the Psychical\r\nResearch Society,\" he says. Possibly human personality is much the same\r\nin all lands and all times.\r\n\r\nConversely, some of the best examples of ghostly literature have had\r\ntheir inspiration in the records of the society, Henry James's _The Turn\r\nof the Screw_ being a notable example. Algernon Blackwood, that\r\nextraordinary adapter of psychic material to fiction, makes frequent\r\nmention of the Psychical Research Society, and uses many aspects of the\r\npsychical in his fiction. Innumerable stories, novels, plays and poems\r\nhave been written to show the nearness of the dead to the living, and\r\nthe thinness of the veil that separates the two worlds. There is deep\r\npathos in the concept of the longing felt by the dead and living alike\r\nto speak with each other, to rend the dividing veil, which adds a\r\npoignancy to literature, even for readers incredulous of the possibility\r\nof such communication. There are many who are unconvinced of the reality\r\nof the messages in _Raymond_, for instance,--yet who could fail to be\r\ntouched by the delicate art with which Barrie suggests the dead son's\r\nreturn in his play, _The Well-Remembered Voice_? While one may be\r\nrepelled by what he feels is fraud and trickery in some of the psychic\r\nrecords, it is impossible not to be moved by such an impressive piece of\r\nsymbolism as Granville Barker's _Souls on Fifth_, where the lonely,\r\nfutile spirits of the dead are represented as hovering near the place\r\nthey knew the best, seeking piteously to win some recognition from the\r\nliving. The repulsive aspects of spirit manifestations have been treated\r\nmany times and with power, as in Joseph Hergesheimer's _The Meeker\r\nRitual_, to give one very recent example. The subject has interested the\r\nminds of many writers who have dealt with it satirically or\r\nsympathetically, or with a curious mixture of scoffing and respect, as\r\ndid Browning in _Sludge, the Medium_. Even such pronounced realists as\r\nWilliam Dean Howells and Hamlin Garland have written novels dealing with\r\nattempts at spirit communication.\r\n\r\nAny subject that has won so incontestable a place in our literature as\r\nthis has, possesses a right to our thought, whatever be our attitude of\r\nacceptance or rejection of its claims to actuality. No person wishes to\r\nbe ignorant of what the world is thinking with reference to a matter so\r\nimportant as the spirit. Hence this volume, _The Best Psychic Stories_,\r\nin presenting these studies in the occult, will have interest for a wide\r\nrange of readers, and Mr. French, the editor, has shown critical\r\ndiscrimination and extensive knowledge of the subject. Many who are\r\nalready interested in psychic phenomena will be glad to be informed\r\nconcerning recent and startling manifestations recounted by special\r\ninvestigators. The sincerity of a man like W. T. Stead, well known and\r\nrespected on both sides of the Atlantic, cannot be doubted, so that his\r\narticle on _Photographing Invisible Beings_ will have unusual weight.\r\nHereward Carrington, author of various books on psychic subjects, and\r\nconsidered an authority in his field, gives in _The Phantom Armies Seen\r\nin France_ a report of occult phenomena widely believed in during the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nHelena Blavatsky, author of _A Witch's Den_, will be remembered as the\r\nsensational medium who mystified experimenters in various lands a few\r\nyears ago. While most of us can be content not to touch a ghost, we may\r\nfind subject for surprise and wonder in Gambier Bolton's _Ghosts in\r\nSolid Form_, describing spirits that can be weighed and put to material\r\ntests, while Dr. Walter H. Prince, well known as a psychic investigator,\r\nrelates remarkable experiments of famous persons, that challenge\r\nexplanation on purely physical bases. These accounts show that modern\r\nscientific investigation of spiritual manifestations can be made as\r\nenthralling as fiction or drama. Hamlin Garland remarks in a recent\r\narticle, _The Spirit-World on Trial_, \"When the medium consented to\r\nenter the laboratory of the physicist, a new era in the study of psychic\r\nphenomena began.\"\r\n\r\nEven those who refuse credence to spirit manifestations in fact, but who\r\nappreciate the art with which they are shown in literature, should read\r\nwith interest the stories given here. The genius of Edgar Allan Poe was\r\nnever more impressive than in his studies of the supernatural, and\r\n_Ligeia_ has a dramatic art unsurpassed even by Poe. The tense economy\r\nwith which Ambrose Bierce could evoke a dreadful spirit is evident in\r\n_The Eyes of the Panther_, and the haunting symbolism of Fiona Macleod's\r\n_The Sin-Eater_ is unforgetable. Lafcadio Hearn, author of _A Ghost_,\r\nheld the belief that there was no great artist in any land, and\r\ncertainly no Anglo-Saxon writer, who had not distinguished himself in\r\nhis use of the supernatural. The subject of the soul's survival after\r\ndeath and its attempts to reveal itself to those still in the folding\r\nflesh is of interest to every rational person, whether as a matter of\r\nscientific concern or merely as an aspect of literary art. And the\r\npossibilities for further use of the psychic in literature are as\r\nalluring as they are illimitable.\r\n\r\n    DOROTHY SCARBOROUGH\r\n\r\n    _New York City\r\n    March 29, 1920_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST PSYCHIC STORIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG[1]\r\n\r\nBY JACK LONDON\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: By permission of The Century Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHe was a very quiet, self-possessed sort of man, sitting a moment on top\r\nof the wall to sound the damp darkness for warnings of the dangers it\r\nmight conceal. But the plummet of his hearing brought nothing to him\r\nsave the moaning of wind through invisible trees and the rustling of\r\nleaves on swaying branches. A heavy fog drifted and drove before the\r\nwind, and though he could not see this fog, the wet of it blew upon his\r\nface, and the wall on which he sat was wet.\r\n\r\nWithout noise he had climbed to the top of the wall from the outside,\r\nand without noise he dropped to the ground on the inside. From his\r\npocket he drew an electric night-stick, but he did not use it. Dark as\r\nthe way was, he was not anxious for light. Carrying the night-stick in\r\nhis hand, his finger on the button, he advanced through the darkness.\r\nThe ground was velvety and springy to his feet, being carpeted with dead\r\npine-needles and leaves and mold which evidently had been undisturbed\r\nfor years. Leaves and branches brushed against his body, but so dark was\r\nit that he could not avoid them. Soon he walked with his hand stretched\r\nout gropingly before him, and more than once the hand fetched up against\r\nthe solid trunks of massive trees. All about him he knew were these\r\ntrees; he sensed the loom of them everywhere; and he experienced a\r\nstrange feeling of microscopic smallness in the midst of great bulks\r\nleaning toward him to crush him. Beyond, he knew, was the house, and he\r\nexpected to find some trail or winding path that would lead easily to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOnce, he found himself trapped. On every side he groped against trees\r\nand branches, or blundered into thickets of underbrush, until there\r\nseemed no way out. Then he turned on his light, circumspectly, directing\r\nits rays to the ground at his feet. Slowly and carefully he moved it\r\nabout him, the white brightness showing in sharp detail all the\r\nobstacles to his progress. He saw an opening between huge-trunked trees,\r\nand advanced through it, putting out the light and treading on dry\r\nfooting as yet protected from the drip of the fog by the dense foliage\r\noverhead. His sense of direction was good, and he knew he was going\r\ntoward the house.\r\n\r\nAnd then the thing happened--the thing unthinkable and unexpected. His\r\ndescending foot came down upon something that was soft and alive, and\r\nthat arose with a snort under the weight of his body. He sprang clear,\r\nand crouched for another spring, anywhere, tense and expectant, keyed\r\nfor the onslaught of the unknown. He waited a moment, wondering what\r\nmanner of animal it was that had arisen from under his foot and that now\r\nmade no sound nor movement and that must be crouching and waiting just\r\nas tensely and expectantly as he. The strain became unbearable. Holding\r\nthe night-stick before him, he pressed the button, saw, and screamed\r\naloud in terror. He was prepared for anything, from a frightened calf or\r\nfawn to a belligerent lion, but he was not prepared for what he saw. In\r\nthat instant his tiny searchlight, sharp and white, had shown him what a\r\nthousand years would not enable him to forget--a man, huge and blond,\r\nyellow-haired and yellow-bearded, naked except for soft-tanned moccasins\r\nand what seemed a goat-skin about his middle. Arms and legs were bare,\r\nas were his shoulders and most of his chest. The skin was smooth and\r\nhairless, but browned by sun and wind, while under it heavy muscles were\r\nknotted like fat snakes.\r\n\r\nStill, this alone, unexpected as it well was, was not what had made the\r\nman scream out. What had caused his terror was the unspeakable ferocity\r\nof the face, the wild-animal glare of the blue eyes scarcely dazzled by\r\nthe light, the pine-needles matted and clinging in the beard and hair,\r\nand the whole formidable body crouched and in the act of springing at\r\nhim. Practically in the instant he saw all this, and while his scream\r\nstill rang, the thing leaped, he flung his night-stick full at it, and\r\nthrew himself to the ground. He felt its feet and shins strike against\r\nhis ribs, and he bounded up and away while the thing itself hurled\r\nonward in a heavy crashing fall into the underbrush.\r\n\r\nAs the noise of the fall ceased, the man stopped and on hands and knees\r\nwaited. He could hear the thing moving about, searching for him, and he\r\nwas afraid to advertise his location by attempting further flight. He\r\nknew that inevitably he would crackle the underbrush and be pursued.\r\nOnce he drew out his revolver, then changed his mind. He had recovered\r\nhis composure and hoped to get away without noise. Several times he\r\nheard the thing beating up the thickets for him, and there were moments\r\nwhen it, too, remained still and listened. This gave an idea to the man.\r\nOne of his hands was resting on a chunk of dead wood. Carefully, first\r\nfeeling about him in the darkness to know that the full swing of his arm\r\nwas clear, he raised the chunk of wood and threw it. It was not a large\r\npiece, and it went far, landing noisily in a bush. He heard the thing\r\nbound into the bush, and at the same time himself crawled steadily away.\r\nAnd on hands and knees, slowly and cautiously, he crawled on, till his\r\nknees were wet on the soggy mold. When he listened he heard naught but\r\nthe moaning wind and the drip-drip of the fog from the branches. Never\r\nabating his caution, he stood erect and went on to the stone wall, over\r\nwhich he climbed and dropped down to the road outside.\r\n\r\nFeeling his way in a clump of bushes, he drew out a bicycle and prepared\r\nto mount. He was in the act of driving the gear around with his foot for\r\nthe purpose of getting the opposite pedal in position, when he heard the\r\nthud of a heavy body that landed lightly and evidently on its feet. He\r\ndid not wait for more, but ran, with hands on the handles of his\r\nbicycle, until he was able to vault astride the saddle, catch the\r\npedals, and start a spurt. Behind he could hear the quick thud-thud of\r\nfeet on the dust of the road, but he drew away from it and lost it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he had started away from the direction of town and was\r\nheading higher up into the hills. He knew that on this particular road\r\nthere were no cross roads. The only way back was past that terror, and\r\nhe could not steel himself to face it. At the end of half an hour,\r\nfinding himself on an ever increasing grade, he dismounted. For still\r\ngreater safety, leaving the wheel by the roadside, he climbed through a\r\nfence into what he decided was a hillside pasture, spread a newspaper on\r\nthe ground, and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" he said aloud, mopping the sweat and fog from his face.\r\n\r\nAnd \"Gosh!\" he said once again, while rolling a cigarette and as he\r\npondered the problem of getting back.\r\n\r\nBut he made no attempt to go back. He was resolved not to face that road\r\nin the dark, and with head bowed on knees, he dozed, waiting for\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nHow long afterward he did not know, he was awakened by the yapping bark\r\nof a young coyote. As he looked about and located it on the brow of the\r\nhill behind him, he noted the change that had come over the face of the\r\nnight. The fog was gone; the stars and moon were out; even the wind had\r\ndied down. It had transformed into a balmy California summer night. He\r\ntried to doze again, but the yap of the coyote disturbed him. Half\r\nasleep, he heard a wild and eery chant. Looking about him, he noticed\r\nthat the coyote had ceased its noise and was running away along the\r\ncrest of the hill, and behind it, in full pursuit, no longer chanting,\r\nran the naked creature he had encountered in the garden. It was a young\r\ncoyote, and it was being overtaken when the chase passed from view. The\r\nman trembled as with a chill as he started to his feet, clambered over\r\nthe fence, and mounted his wheel. But it was his chance and he knew it.\r\nThe terror was no longer between him and Mill Valley.\r\n\r\nHe sped at a breakneck rate down the hill, but in the turn at the\r\nbottom, in the deep shadows, he encountered a chuck-hole and pitched\r\nheadlong over the handle bar.\r\n\r\n\"It's sure not my night,\" he muttered, as he examined the broken fork of\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\nShouldering the useless wheel, he trudged on. In time he came to the\r\nstone wall, and, half disbelieving his experience, he sought in the road\r\nfor tracks, and found them--moccasin tracks, large ones, deep-bitten\r\ninto the dust at the toes. It was while bending over them, examining,\r\nthat again he heard the eery chant. He had seen the thing pursue the\r\ncoyote, and he knew he had no chance on a straight run. He did not\r\nattempt it, contenting himself with hiding in the shadows on the off\r\nside of the road.\r\n\r\nAnd again he saw the thing that was like a naked man, running swiftly\r\nand lightly and singing as it ran. Opposite him it paused, and his heart\r\nstood still. But instead of coming toward his hiding-place, it leaped\r\ninto the air, caught the branch of a roadside tree, and swung swiftly\r\nupward, from limb to limb, like an ape. It swung across the wall, and a\r\ndozen feet above the top, into the branches of another tree, and dropped\r\nout of sight to the ground. The man waited a few wondering minutes, then\r\nstarted on.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nDave Slotter leaned belligerently against the desk that barred the way\r\nto the private office of James Ward, senior partner of the firm of Ward,\r\nKnowles & Co. Dave was angry. Every one in the outer office had looked\r\nhim over suspiciously, and the man who faced him was excessively\r\nsuspicious.\r\n\r\n\"You just tell Mr. Ward it's important,\" he urged.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you he is dictating and cannot be disturbed,\" was the answer.\r\n\"Come to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow will be too late. You just trot along and tell Mr. Ward it's\r\na matter of life and death.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary hesitated and Dave seized the advantage.\r\n\r\n\"You just tell him I was across the bay in Mill Valley last night, and\r\nthat I want to put him wise to something.\"\r\n\r\n\"What name?\" was the query.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the name. He don't know me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Dave was shown into the private office, he was still in the\r\nbelligerent frame of mind, but when he saw a large fair man whirl in a\r\nrevolving chair from dictating to a stenographer to face him, Dave's\r\ndemeanor abruptly changed. He did not know why it changed, and he was\r\nsecretly angry with himself.\r\n\r\n\"You are Mr. Ward?\" Dave asked with a fatuousness that still further\r\nirritated him. He had never intended it at all.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" came the answer. \"And who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry Bancroft,\" Dave lied. \"You don't know me, and my name don't\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sent in word that you were in Mill Valley last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"You live there, don't you?\" Dave countered, looking suspiciously at the\r\nstenographer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. What do you mean to see me about? I am very busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see you alone, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ward gave him a quick, penetrating look, hesitated, then made up his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"That will do for a few minutes, Miss Potter.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl arose, gathered her notes together, and passed out. Dave looked\r\nat Mr. James Ward wonderingly, until that gentleman broke his train of\r\ninchoate thought.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was over in Mill Valley last night,\" Dave began confusedly.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that before. What do you want?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Dave proceeded in the face of a growing conviction that was\r\nunbelievable.\r\n\r\n\"I was at your house, or in the grounds, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were you doing there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to break in,\" Dave answered in all frankness. \"I heard you lived\r\nall alone with a Chinaman for cook, and it looked good to me. Only I\r\ndidn't break in. Something happened that prevented. That's why I'm here.\r\nI come to warn you. I found a wild man loose in your grounds--a regular\r\ndevil. He could pull a guy like me to pieces. He gave me the run of my\r\nlife. He don't wear any clothes to speak of, he climbs trees like a\r\nmonkey, and he runs like a deer. I saw him chasing a coyote, and the\r\nlast I saw of it, by God, he was gaining on it.\"\r\n\r\nDave paused and looked for the effect that would follow his words. But\r\nno effect came. James Ward was quietly curious, and that was all.\r\n\r\n\"Very remarkable, very remarkable,\" he murmured. \"A wild man, you say.\r\nWhy have you come to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"To warn you of your danger. I'm something of a hard proposition myself,\r\nbut I don't believe in killing people ... that is, unnecessarily. I\r\nrealized that you was in danger. I thought I'd warn you. Honest, that's\r\nthe game. Of course, if you wanted to give me anything for my trouble,\r\nI'd take it. That was in my mind, too. But I don't care whether you give\r\nme anything or not. I've warned you anyway, and done my duty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ward meditated and drummed on the surface of his desk. Dave noticed\r\nthat his hands were large, powerful, withal well-cared for despite their\r\ndark sunburn. Also, he noted what had already caught his eye before--a\r\ntiny strip of flesh-colored courtplaster on the forehead over one eye.\r\nAnd still the thought that forced itself into his mind was unbelievable.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward took a wallet from his inside coat pocket, drew out a\r\ngreenback, and passed it to Dave, who noted as he pocketed it that it\r\nwas for twenty dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Mr. Ward, indicating that the interview was at an end.\r\n\"I shall have the matter investigated. A wild man running loose _is_\r\ndangerous.\"\r\n\r\nBut so quiet a man was Mr. Ward, that Dave's courage returned. Besides,\r\na new theory had suggested itself. The wild man was evidently Mr. Ward's\r\nbrother, a lunatic privately confined. Dave had heard of such things.\r\nPerhaps Mr. Ward wanted it kept quiet. That was why he had given him the\r\ntwenty dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" Dave began, \"now I come to think of it that wild man looked a lot\r\nlike you--\"\r\n\r\nThat was as far as Dave got, for at that moment he witnessed a\r\ntransformation and found himself gazing into the same unspeakably\r\nferocious blue eyes of the night before, at the same clutching\r\ntalon-like hands, and at the same formidable bulk in the act of\r\nspringing upon him. But this time Dave had no night-stick to throw, and\r\nhe was caught by the biceps of both arms in a grip so terrific that it\r\nmade him groan with pain. He saw the large white teeth exposed, for all\r\nthe world as a dog's about to bite. Mr. Ward's beard brushed his face as\r\nthe teeth went in for the grip of his throat. But the bite was not\r\ngiven. Instead, Dave felt the other's body stiffen as with an iron\r\nrestraint, and then he was flung aside, without effort but with such\r\nforce that only the wall stopped his momentum and dropped him gasping to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by coming here and trying to blackmail me?\" Mr. Ward\r\nwas snarling at him. \"Here, give me back that money.\"\r\n\r\nDave passed the bill back without a word.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you came here with good intentions. I know you now. Let me\r\nsee and hear no more of you, or I'll put you in prison where you belong.\r\nDo you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Dave gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Then go.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Dave went, without further word, both his biceps aching intolerably\r\nfrom the bruise of that tremendous grip. As his hand rested on the door\r\nknob, he was stopped.\r\n\r\n\"You were lucky,\" Mr. Ward was saying, and Dave noted that his face and\r\neyes were cruel and gloating and proud. \"You were lucky. Had I wanted, I\r\ncould have torn your muscles out of your arms and thrown them in the\r\nwaste basket there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Dave; and absolute conviction vibrated in his voice.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and passed out. The secretary looked at him\r\ninterrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" was all Dave vouchsafed, and with this utterance passed out of\r\nthe offices and the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nJames G. Ward was forty years of age, a successful business man, and\r\nvery unhappy. For forty years he had vainly tried to solve a problem\r\nthat was really himself and that with increasing years became more and\r\nmore a woeful affliction. In himself he was two men, and,\r\nchronologically speaking, these men were several thousand years or so\r\napart. He had studied the question of dual personality probably more\r\nprofoundly than any half dozen of the leading specialists in that\r\nintricate and mysterious psychological field. In himself he was a\r\ndifferent case from any that had been recorded. Even the most fanciful\r\nflights of the fiction-writers had not quite hit upon him. He was not a\r\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, nor was he like the unfortunate young man in\r\nKipling's _Greatest Story in the World_. His two personalities were so\r\nmixed that they were practically aware of themselves and of each other\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\nHis one self was that of a man whose rearing and education were modern\r\nand who had lived through the latter part of the nineteenth century and\r\nwell into the first decade of the twentieth. His other self he had\r\nlocated as a savage and a barbarian living under the primitive\r\nconditions of several thousand years before. But which self was he, and\r\nwhich was the other, he could never tell. For he was both selves, and\r\nboth selves all the time. Very rarely indeed did it happen that one self\r\ndid not know what the other was doing. Another thing was that he had no\r\nvisions nor memories of the past in which that early self had lived.\r\nThat early self lived in the present; but while it lived in the present,\r\nit was under the compulsion to live the way of life that must have been\r\nin that distant past.\r\n\r\nIn his childhood he had been a problem to his father and mother, and to\r\nthe family doctors, though never had they come within a thousand miles\r\nof hitting upon the clue to his erratic conduct. Thus, they could not\r\nunderstand his excessive somnolence in the forenoon, nor his excessive\r\nactivity at night. When they found him wandering along the hallways at\r\nnight, or climbing over giddy roofs, or running in the hills, they\r\ndecided he was a somnambulist. In reality he was wide-eyed awake and\r\nmerely under the night-roaming compulsion of his early life. Questioned\r\nby an obtuse medico, he once told the truth and suffered the ignominy of\r\nhaving the revelation contemptuously labeled and dismissed as \"dreams.\"\r\n\r\nThe point was, that as twilight and evening came on he became wakeful.\r\nThe four walls of a room were an irk and a restraint. He heard a\r\nthousand voices whispering to him through the darkness. The night\r\ncalled to him, for he was, for that period of the twenty-four hours,\r\nessentially a night-prowler. But nobody understood, and never again did\r\nhe attempt to explain. They classified him as a sleep-walker and took\r\nprecautions accordingly--precautions that very often were futile. As his\r\nchildhood advanced, he grew more cunning, so that the major portion of\r\nall his nights were spent in the open at realizing his other self. As a\r\nresult, he slept in the forenoons. Morning studies and schools were\r\nimpossible, and it was discovered that only in the afternoons, under\r\nprivate teachers, could he be taught anything. Thus was his modern self\r\neducated and developed.\r\n\r\nBut a problem, as a child, he ever remained. He was known as a little\r\ndemon of insensate cruelty and viciousness. The family medicos privately\r\nadjudged him a mental monstrosity and a degenerate. Such few boy\r\ncompanions as he had, hailed him as a wonder, though they were all\r\nafraid of him. He could outclimb, outswim, outrun, outdevil any of them;\r\nwhile none dared fight with him. He was too terribly strong, too madly\r\nfurious.\r\n\r\nWhen nine years of age he ran away to the hills, where he flourished,\r\nnight-prowling, for seven weeks before he was discovered and brought\r\nhome. The marvel was how he had managed to subsist and keep in condition\r\nduring that time. They did not know, and he never told them, of the\r\nrabbits he had killed, of the quail, young and old, he had captured and\r\ndevoured, of the farmers' chicken-roosts he had raided, nor of the\r\ncave-lair he had made and carpeted with dry leaves and grasses and in\r\nwhich he had slept in warmth and comfort, through the forenoons of many\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAt college he was notorious for his sleepiness and stupidity during the\r\nmorning lectures and for his brilliance in the afternoon. By collateral\r\nreading and by borrowing the notebook of his fellow students he managed\r\nto scrape through the detestable morning courses, while his afternoon\r\ncourses were triumphs. In football he proved a giant and a terror, and,\r\nin almost every form of track athletics, save for strange Berserker\r\nrages that were sometimes displayed, he could be depended upon to win.\r\nBut his fellows were afraid to box with him, and he signalized his last\r\nwrestling bout by sinking his teeth into the shoulder of his opponent.\r\n\r\nAfter college, his father, in despair, sent him among the cow-punchers\r\nof a Wyoming ranch. Three months later the doughty cowmen confessed he\r\nwas too much for them and telegraphed his father to come and take the\r\nwild man away. Also, when the father arrived to take him away, the\r\ncowmen allowed that they would vastly prefer chumming with howling\r\ncannibals, gibbering lunatics, cavorting gorillas, grizzly bears, and\r\nman-eating tigers than with this particular young college product with\r\nhair parted in the middle.\r\n\r\nThere was one exception to the lack of memory of the life of his early\r\nself, and that was language. By some quirk of atavism, a certain portion\r\nof that early self's language had come down to him as a racial memory.\r\nIn moments of happiness, exaltation, or battle, he was prone to burst\r\nout in wild barbaric songs or chants. It was by this means that he\r\nlocated in time and space that strayed half of him who should have been\r\ndead and dust for thousands of years. He sang, once, and deliberately,\r\nseveral of the ancient chants in the presence of Professor Wertz, who\r\ngave courses in old Saxon and who was a philologist of repute and\r\npassion. At the first one, the professor pricked up his ears and\r\ndemanded to know what mongrel tongue or hog-German it was. When the\r\nsecond chant was rendered, the professor was highly excited. James Ward\r\nthen concluded the performance by giving a song that always irresistibly\r\nrushed to his lips when he was engaged in fierce struggling or fighting.\r\nThen it was that Professor Wertz proclaimed it no hog-German, but early\r\nGerman, or early Teuton, of a date that must far precede anything that\r\nhad ever been discovered and handed down by the scholars. So early was\r\nit that it was beyond him; yet it was filled with haunting reminiscences\r\nof word-forms he knew and which his trained intuition told him were true\r\nand real. He demanded the source of the songs, and asked to borrow the\r\nprevious book that contained them. Also, he demanded to know why young\r\nWard had always posed as being profoundly ignorant of the German\r\nlanguage. And Ward could neither explain his ignorance nor lend the\r\nbook. Whereupon, after pleadings and entreaties that extended through\r\nweeks, Professor Wertz took a dislike to the young man, believed him a\r\nliar, and classified him as a man of monstrous selfishness for not\r\ngiving him a glimpse of this wonderful screed that was older than the\r\noldest any philologist had ever known or dreamed.\r\n\r\nBut little good did it do this much-mixed young man to know that half of\r\nhim was late American and the other half early Teuton. Nevertheless, the\r\nlate American in him was no weakling, and he (if he were a he and had a\r\nshred of existence outside of these two) compelled an adjustment or\r\ncompromise between his one self that was a night-prowling savage that\r\nkept his other self sleepy of mornings, and that other self that was\r\ncultured and refined and that wanted to be normal and love and prosecute\r\nbusiness like other people. The afternoons and early evenings he gave to\r\nthe one, the nights to the other; the forenoons and parts of the nights\r\nwere devoted to sleep for the twain. But in the mornings he slept in bed\r\nlike a civilized man. In the night time he slept like a wild animal, as\r\nhe had slept the night Dave Slotter stepped on him in the woods.\r\n\r\nPersuading his father to advance the capital, he went into business, and\r\nkeen and successful business he made of it, devoting his afternoons\r\nwhole-souled to it, while his partner devoted the mornings. The early\r\nevenings he spent socially, but, as the hour grew to nine or ten, an\r\nirresistible restlessness overcame him and he disappeared from the\r\nhaunts of men until the next afternoon. Friends and acquaintances\r\nthought that he spent much of his time in sport. And they were right,\r\nthough they never would have dreamed of the nature of the sport, even if\r\nthey had seen him running coyotes in night-chases over the hills of Mill\r\nValley. Neither were the schooner captains believed when they reported\r\nseeing, on cold winter mornings, a man swimming in the tide-rips of\r\nRaccoon Straits or in the swift currents between Goat Island and Angel\r\nIsland miles from shore.\r\n\r\nIn the bungalow at Mill Valley he lived alone, save for Lee Sing, the\r\nChinese cook and factotum, who knew much about the strangeness of his\r\nmaster, who was paid well for saying nothing, and who never did say\r\nanything. After the satisfaction of his nights, a morning's sleep, and a\r\nbreakfast of Lee Sing's, James Ward crossed the bay to San Francisco on\r\na midday ferryboat and went to the club and on to his office, as normal\r\nand conventional a man of business as could be found in the city. But as\r\nthe evening lengthened, the night called to him. There came a quickening\r\nof all his perceptions and a restlessness. His hearing was suddenly\r\nacute; the myriad night-noises told him a luring and familiar story;\r\nand, if alone, he would begin to pace up and down the narrow room like\r\nany caged animal from the wild.\r\n\r\nOnce, he ventured to fall in love. He never permitted himself that\r\ndiversion again. He was afraid. And for many a day the young lady,\r\nscared at least out of a portion of her young ladyhood, bore on her arms\r\nand shoulders and wrists divers black-and-blue bruises--tokens of\r\ncaresses which he had bestowed in all fond gentleness but too late at\r\nnight. There was the mistake. Had he ventured love-making in the\r\nafternoon, all would have been well, for it would have been as the quiet\r\ngentleman that he would have made love--but at night it was the uncouth,\r\nwife-stealing savage of the dark German forests. Out of his wisdom, he\r\ndecided that afternoon love-making could be prosecuted successfully; but\r\nout of the same wisdom he was convinced that marriage would prove a\r\nghastly failure. He found it appalling to imagine being married and\r\nencountering his wife after dark.\r\n\r\nSo he had eschewed all love-making, regulated his dual life, cleaned up\r\na million in business, fought shy of match-making mamas and bright- and\r\neager-eyed young ladies of various ages, met Lilian Gersdale and made it\r\na rigid observance never to see her later than eight o'clock in the\r\nevening, ran of nights after his coyotes, and slept in forest lairs--and\r\nthrough it all had kept his secret save for Lee Sing ... and now, Dave\r\nSlotter. It was the latter's discovery of both his selves that\r\nfrightened him. In spite of the counter fright he had given the burglar,\r\nthe latter might talk. And even if he did not, sooner or later he would\r\nbe found out by some one else.\r\n\r\nThus it was that James Ward made a fresh and heroic effort to control\r\nthe Teutonic barbarian that was half of him. So well did he make it a\r\npoint to see Lilian in the afternoons and early evenings, that the time\r\ncame when she accepted him for better or worse, and when he prayed\r\nprivily and fervently that it was not for worse. During this period no\r\nprize-fighter ever trained more harshly and faithfully for a contest\r\nthan he trained to subdue the wild savage in him. Among other things, he\r\nstrove to exhaust himself during the day, so that sleep would render him\r\ndeaf to the call of the night. He took a vacation from the office and\r\nwent on long hunting trips, following the deer through the most\r\ninaccessible and rugged country he could find--and always in the\r\ndaytime. Night found him indoors and tired. At home he installed a score\r\nof exercise machines, and where other men might go through a particular\r\nmovement ten times, he went hundreds. Also, as a compromise, he built a\r\nsleeping porch on the second story. Here he at least breathed the\r\nblessed night air. Double screens prevented him from escaping into the\r\nwoods, and each night Lee Sing locked him in and each morning let him\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe time came, in the month of August, when he engaged additional\r\nservants to assist Lee Sing and dared a house party in his Mill Valley\r\nbungalow. Lilian, her mother and brother, and half a dozen mutual\r\nfriends, were the guests. For two days and nights all went well. And on\r\nthe third night, playing bridge till eleven o'clock, he had reason to be\r\nproud of himself. His restlessness he successfully hid, but as luck\r\nwould have it, Lilian Gersdale was his opponent on his right. She was a\r\nfrail delicate flower of a woman, and in his night-mood her very frailty\r\nincensed him. Not that he loved her less, but that he felt almost\r\nirresistibly impelled to reach out and paw and maul her. Especially was\r\nthis true when she was engaged in playing a winning hand against him.\r\n\r\nHe had one of the deer-hounds brought in, and, when it seemed he must\r\nfly to pieces with the tension, a caressing hand laid on the animal\r\nbrought him relief. These contacts with the hairy coat gave him instant\r\neasement and enabled him to play out the evening. Nor did any one guess\r\nthe terrible struggle their host was making, the while he laughed so\r\ncarelessly and played so keenly and deliberately.\r\n\r\nWhen they separated for the night, he saw to it that he parted from\r\nLilian in the presence of the others. Once on his sleeping porch, and\r\nsafely locked in, he doubled and tripled and even quadrupled his\r\nexercises until, exhausted, he lay down on the couch to woo sleep and to\r\nponder two problems that especially troubled him. One was this matter\r\nof exercise. It was a paradox. The more he exercised in this excessive\r\nfashion, the stronger he became. While it was true that he thus quite\r\ntired out his night-running Teutonic self, it seemed that he was merely\r\nsetting back the fatal day when his strength would be too much for him\r\nand overpower him, and then it would be a strength more terrible than he\r\nhad yet known. The other problem was that of his marriage and of the\r\nstratagems he must employ in order to avoid his wife after dark. And\r\nthus fruitlessly pondering he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNow, where the huge grizzly bear came from that night was long a\r\nmystery, while the people of the Springs Brothers' Circus, showing at\r\nSausalito, searched long and vainly for \"Big Ben, the Biggest Grizzly in\r\nCaptivity.\" But Big Ben escaped, and, out of the mazes of half a\r\nthousand bungalows and country estates, selected the grounds of James J.\r\nWard for visitation. The first Mr. Ward knew was when he found himself\r\non his feet, quivering and tense, a surge of battle in his breast and on\r\nhis lips the old war-chant. From without came a wild baying and\r\nbellowing of the hounds. And sharp as a knife-thrust through the\r\npandemonium came the agony of a stricken dog--his dog, he knew.\r\n\r\nNot stopping for slippers, pajama-clad, he burst through the door Lee\r\nSing had so carefully locked, and sped down the stairs and out into the\r\nnight. As his naked feet struck the graveled driveway, he stopped\r\nabruptly, reached under the steps to a hiding-place he knew well, and\r\npulled forth a huge knotty club--his old companion on many a mad night\r\nadventure on the hills. The frantic hullabaloo of the dogs was coming\r\nnearer, and, swinging the club, he sprang straight into the thickets to\r\nmeet it.\r\n\r\nThe aroused household assembled on the wide veranda. Somebody turned on\r\nthe electric lights, but they could see nothing but one another's\r\nfrightened faces. Beyond the brightly illuminated driveway the trees\r\nformed a wall of impenetrable blackness. Yet somewhere in that blackness\r\na terrible struggle was going on. There was an infernal outcry of\r\nanimals, a great snarling and growling, the sound of blows being struck,\r\nand a smashing and crashing of underbrush by heavy bodies.\r\n\r\nThe tide of battle swept out from among the trees and upon the driveway\r\njust beneath the onlookers. Then they saw. Mrs. Gersdale cried out and\r\nclung fainting to her son. Lilian, clutching the railing so\r\nspasmodically that a bruising hurt was left in her finger-ends for days,\r\ngazed horror-stricken at a yellow-haired, wild-eyed giant whom she\r\nrecognized as the man who was to be her husband. He was swinging a great\r\nclub, and fighting furiously and calmly with a shaggy monster that was\r\nbigger than any bear she had ever seen. One rip of the beast's claws had\r\ndragged away Ward's pajama-coat and streaked his flesh with blood.\r\n\r\nWhile most of Lilian Gersdale's fright was for the man beloved, there\r\nwas a large portion of it due to the man himself. Never had she dreamed\r\nso formidable and magnificent a savage lurked under the starched shirt\r\nand conventional garb of her betrothed. And never had she had any\r\nconception of how a man battled. Such a battle was certainly not modern;\r\nnor was she there beholding a modern man, though she did not know it.\r\nFor this was not Mr. James J. Ward, the San Francisco business man, but\r\none unnamed and unknown, a crude, rude savage creature who, by some\r\nfreak of chance, lived again after thrice a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe hounds, ever maintaining their mad uproar, circled about the fight,\r\nor dashed in and out, distracting the bear. When the animal turned to\r\nmeet such flanking assaults, the man leaped in and the club came down.\r\nAngered afresh by every such blow, the bear would rush, and the man,\r\nleaping and skipping, avoiding the dogs, went backwards or circled to\r\none side or the other. Whereupon the dogs, taking advantage of the\r\nopening, would again spring in and draw the animal's wrath to them.\r\n\r\nThe end came suddenly. Whirling, the grizzly caught a hound with a wide\r\nsweeping cuff that sent the brute, its ribs caved in and its back\r\nbroken, hurtling twenty feet. Then the human brute went mad. A foaming\r\nrage flecked the lips that parted with a wild inarticulate cry, as it\r\nsprang in, swung the club mightily in both hands, and brought it down\r\nfull on the head of the uprearing grizzly. Not even the skull of a\r\ngrizzly could withstand the crushing force of such a blow, and the\r\nanimal went down to meet the worrying of the hounds. And through their\r\nscurrying leaped the man, squarely upon the body, where, in the white\r\nelectric light, resting on his club, he chanted a triumph in an unknown\r\ntongue--a song so ancient that Professor Wertz would have given ten\r\nyears of his life for it.\r\n\r\nHis guests rushed to possess him and acclaim him, but James Ward,\r\nsuddenly looking out of the eyes of the early Teuton, saw the fair frail\r\nTwentieth Century girl he loved, and felt something snap in his brain.\r\nHe staggered weakly toward her, dropped the club, and nearly fell.\r\nSomething had gone wrong with him. Inside his brain was an intolerable\r\nagony. It seemed as if the soul of him were flying asunder. Following\r\nthe excited gaze of the others, he glanced back and saw the carcass of\r\nthe bear. The sight filled him with fear. He uttered a cry and would\r\nhave fled, had they not restrained him and led him into the bungalow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJames J. Ward is still at the head of the firm of Ward, Knowles & Co.\r\nBut he no longer lives in the country; nor does he run of nights after\r\nthe coyotes under the moon. The early Teuton in him died the night of\r\nthe Mill Valley fight with the bear. James J. Ward is now wholly James\r\nJ. Ward, and he shares no part of his being with any vagabond\r\nanachronism from the younger world. And so wholly is James J. Ward\r\nmodern, that he knows in all its bitter fullness the curse of civilized\r\nfear. He is now afraid of the dark, and night in the forest is to him a\r\nthing of abysmal terror. His city house is of the spick and span order,\r\nand he evinces a great interest in burglar-proof devices. His home is a\r\ntangle of electric wires, and after bed-time a guest can scarcely\r\nbreathe without setting off an alarm. Also, he has invented a\r\ncombination keyless door-lock that travelers may carry in their vest\r\npockets and apply immediately and successfully under all circumstances.\r\nBut his wife does not deem him a coward. She knows better. And, like any\r\nhero, he is content to rest on his laurels. His bravery is never\r\nquestioned by those of his friends who are aware of the Mill Valley\r\nepisode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN[2]\r\n\r\nBY ALGERNON BLACKWOOD\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: From _Pan's Garden_, by Algernon Blackwood--Permission of\r\nthe Macmillan Company.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was curious--that sense of dull uneasiness that came over him so\r\nsuddenly, so stealthily at first he scarcely noticed it, but with such\r\nmarked increase after a time that he presently got up and left the\r\ntheater. His seat was on the gangway of the dress circle, and he slipped\r\nout awkwardly in the middle of what seemed to be the best and jolliest\r\nsong of the piece. The full house was shaking with laughter; so\r\ninfectious was the gaiety that even strangers turned to one another as\r\nmuch as to say, \"Now, isn't that funny?\"\r\n\r\nIt was curious, too, the way the feeling first got into him at all, and\r\nin the full swing of laughter, music, light-heartedness; for it came as\r\na vague suggestion, \"I've forgotten something--something I meant to\r\ndo--something of importance. What in the world was it, now?\" And he\r\nthought hard, searching vainly through his mind; then dismissed it as\r\nthe dancing caught his attention. It came back a little later again,\r\nduring a passage of long-winded talk that bored him and set his\r\nattention free once more, but came more strongly this time, insisting on\r\nan answer. What could it have been that he had overlooked, left undone,\r\nomitted to see to? It went on nibbling at the subconscious part of him.\r\nSeveral times this happened, this dismissal and return, till at last the\r\nthing declared itself more plainly--and he felt bothered, troubled,\r\ndistinctly uneasy.\r\n\r\nHe was wanted somewhere. There was somewhere else he ought to be. That\r\ndescribes it best, perhaps. Some engagement of moment had entirely\r\nslipped his memory--an engagement that involved another person, too. But\r\nwhere, what, with whom? And, at length, this vague uneasiness amounted\r\nto positive discomfort, so that he felt unable to enjoy the piece, and\r\nleft abruptly. Like a man to whom comes suddenly the horrible idea that\r\nthe match he lit his cigarette with and flung into the waste-paper\r\nbasket on leaving was not really out--a sort of panic distress--he\r\njumped into a taxicab and hurried to his flat to find everything in\r\norder, of course; no smoke, no fire, no smell of burning.\r\n\r\nBut his evening was spoiled. He sat smoking in his armchair at home,\r\nthis business man of forty, practical in mind, of character some called\r\nstolid, cursing himself for an imaginative fool. It was now too late to\r\ngo back to the theater; the club bored him; he spent an hour with the\r\nevening papers, dipping into books, sipping a long cool drink, doing\r\nodds and ends about the flat. \"I'll go to bed early for a change,\" he\r\nlaughed, but really all the time fighting--yes, deliberately\r\nfighting--this strange attack of uneasiness that so insidiously grew\r\nupwards, outwards from the buried depths of him that sought so\r\nstrenuously to deny it. It never occurred to him that he was ill. He was\r\nnot ill. His health was thunderingly good. He was as robust as a\r\ncoal-heaver.\r\n\r\nThe flat was roomy, high up on the top floor, yet in a busy part of\r\ntown, so that the roar of traffic mounted round it like a sea. Through\r\nthe open windows came the fresh night air of June. He had never noticed\r\nbefore how sweet the London night air could be, and that not all the\r\nsmoke and dust could smother a certain touch of wild fragrance that\r\ntinctured it with perfume--yes, almost perfume--as of the country. He\r\nswallowed a draught of it as he stood there, staring out across the\r\ntangled world of roofs and chimney-pots. He saw the procession of the\r\nclouds; he saw the stars; he saw the moonlight falling in a shower of\r\nsilver spears upon the slates and wires and steeples. And something in\r\nhim quickened--something that had never stirred before.\r\n\r\nHe turned with a horrid start, for the uneasiness had of a sudden leaped\r\nwithin him like an animal. There was some one in the flat.\r\n\r\nInstantly, with action--even this slight action--the fancy vanished;\r\nbut, all the same, he switched on the electric lights and made a search.\r\nFor it seemed to him that some one had crept up close behind him while\r\nhe stood there watching the night--some one, whose silent presence\r\nfingered with unerring touch both this new thing that had quickened in\r\nhis heart and that sense of original deep uneasiness. He was amazed at\r\nhimself--angry--indignant that he could be thus foolishly upset over\r\nnothing, yet at the same time profoundly distressed at this vehement\r\ngrowth of a new thing in his well-ordered personality. Growth? He\r\ndismissed the word the moment it occurred to him--but it had occurred to\r\nhim. It stayed. While he searched the empty flat, the long passages, the\r\ngloomy bedroom at the end, the little hall where he kept his overcoats\r\nand golf sticks, it stayed. Growth! It was oddly disquieting. Growth\r\nto him involved, though he neither acknowledged nor recognized the truth\r\nperhaps, some kind of undesirable changeableness, instability,\r\nunbalance.\r\n\r\nYet singular as it all was, he realized that the uneasiness and the\r\nsudden appreciation of beauty that was so new to him had both entered by\r\nthe same door into his being. When he came back to the front room he\r\nnoticed that he was perspiring. There were little drops of moisture on\r\nhis forehead. And down his spine ran chills, little, faint quivers of\r\ncold. He was shivering.\r\n\r\nHe lit his big meerschaum pipe, and left the lights all burning. The\r\nfeeling that there was something he had overlooked, forgotten, left\r\nundone, had vanished. Whatever the original cause of this absurd\r\nuneasiness might be--he called it absurd on purpose because he now\r\nrealized in the depths of him that it was really more vital than he\r\ncared about--it was much nearer to discovery than before. It dodged\r\nabout just below the threshold of discovery. It was as close as that.\r\nAny moment he would know what it was; he would remember. Yes, he would\r\n_remember_. Meanwhile, he was in the right place. No desire to go\r\nelsewhere afflicted him, as in the theater. Here was the place, here in\r\nthe flat.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was with a kind of sudden burst and rush--it seemed to him\r\nthe only way to phrase it--memory gave up her dead.\r\n\r\nAt first he only caught her peeping round the corner at him, drawing\r\naside a corner of an enormous curtain, as it were; striving for more\r\ncomplete entrance as though the mass of it were difficult to move. But\r\nhe understood, he knew, he recognized. It was enough for that. As an\r\nentrance into his being--heart, mind, soul--was being attempted and the\r\nentrance because of his stolid temperament was difficult of\r\naccomplishment, there was effort, strain. Something in him had first to\r\nbe opened up, widened, made soft and ready as by an operation, before\r\nfull entrance could be effected. This much he grasped though for the\r\nlife of him he could not have put it into words. Also he knew who it was\r\nthat sought an entrance. Deliberately from himself he withheld the name.\r\nBut he knew as surely as though Straughan stood in the room and faced\r\nhim with a knife saying, \"Let me in, let me in. I wish you to know I'm\r\nhere. I'm clearing a way! You recall our promise?\"\r\n\r\nHe rose from his chair and went to the open window again, the strange\r\nfear slowly passing. The cool air fanned his cheeks. Beauty till now had\r\nscarcely ever brushed the surface of his soul. He had never troubled his\r\nhead about it. It passed him by indifferent; and he had ever loathed the\r\nmouthy prating of it on others' lips. He was practical; beauty was for\r\ndreamers, for women, for men who had means and leisure. He had not\r\nexactly scorned it; rather it had never touched his life, to sweeten, to\r\ncheer, to uplift. Artists for him were like monks--another sex\r\nalmost--useless beings who never helped the world go round. He was for\r\naction always, work, activity, achievement as he saw them. He remembered\r\nStraughan vaguely--Straughan, the ever impecunious friend of his youth,\r\nalways talking of color and sound--mysterious, ineffectual things. He\r\neven forgot what they had quarreled about, if they had quarreled at all\r\neven; or why they had gone apart all these years ago. And certainly he\r\nhad forgotten any promise. Memory as yet only peeped at him round the\r\ncorner of that huge curtain tentatively, suggestively, yet--he was\r\nobliged to admit it--somewhat winningly. He was conscious of this\r\ngentle, sweet seductiveness that now replaced his fear.\r\n\r\nAnd as he stood now at the open window peering over huge London, beauty\r\ncame close and smote him between the eyes. She came blindingly, with her\r\ntrain of stars and clouds and perfumes. Night, mysterious, myriad-eyed,\r\nand flaming across her sea of haunted shadows invaded his heart and\r\nshook him with her immemorial wonder and delight. He found no words of\r\ncourse to clothe the new unwonted sensations. He only knew that all his\r\nformer dread, uneasiness, distress, and with them this idea of growth\r\nthat had seemed so repugnant to him were merged, swept up, and gathered\r\nmagnificently home into a wave of beauty that enveloped him. \"See it,\r\nand understand,\" ran a secret inner whisper across his mind. He saw. He\r\nunderstood....\r\n\r\nHe went back and turned the lights out. Then he took his place again at\r\nthat open window, drinking in the night. He saw a new world; a species\r\nof intoxication held him. He sighed, as his thoughts blundered for\r\nexpression among words and sentences that knew him not. But the delight\r\nwas there, the wonder, the mystery. He watched with heart alternately\r\ntightening and expanding the transfiguring play of moon and shadow over\r\nthe sea of buildings. He saw the dance of the hurrying clouds, the open\r\npatches into outer space, the veiling and unveiling of that ancient\r\nsilvery face; and he caught strange whispers of the hierophantic,\r\nsacerdotal power that has echoed down the world since Time began and\r\ndropped strange magic phrases into every poet's heart, since first \"God\r\ndawned on Chaos\"--the Beauty of the Night.\r\n\r\nA long time passed--it may have been one hour, it may have been\r\nthree--when at length he turned away and went slowly to his bedroom. A\r\ndeep peace lay over him. Something quite new and blessed had crept into\r\nhis life and thought. He could not quite understand it all. He only knew\r\nthat it uplifted. There was no longer the least sign of affliction or\r\ndistress. Even the inevitable reaction that set in could not destroy\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAnd then as he lay in bed nearing the borderland of sleep, suddenly and\r\nwithout any obvious suggestion to bring it, he remembered another thing.\r\nHe remembered the promise. Memory got past the big curtain for an\r\ninstant and showed her face. She looked into his eyes. It must have been\r\na dozen years ago when Straughan and he had made that foolish solemn\r\npromise, that whoever died first should show himself if possible to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHe had utterly forgotten it--till now. But Straughan had not forgotten\r\nit. The letter came three weeks later from India. That very evening\r\nStraughan had died--at nine o'clock. And he had come back--in the Beauty\r\nthat he loved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND GENERATION[3]\r\n\r\nBY ALGERNON BLACKWOOD\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _From Ten-Minute Stories_, published by E. P. Dutton & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, in a moment of sharp experience, comes that vivid flash of\r\ninsight that makes a platitude suddenly seem a revelation--its full\r\ncontent is abruptly realized. \"Ten years _is_ a long time, yes,\" he\r\nthought, as he walked up the drive to the great Kensington house where\r\nshe still lived.\r\n\r\nTen years--long enough, at any rate, for her to have married and for her\r\nhusband to have died. More than that he had not heard, in the outlandish\r\nplaces where life had cast him in the interval. He wondered whether\r\nthere had been any children. All manner of thoughts and questions,\r\nconfused a little, passed across his mind. He was well-to-do now, though\r\nprobably his entire capital did not amount to her income for a single\r\nyear. He glanced at the huge, forbidding mansion. Yet that pride was\r\nfalse which had made of poverty an insuperable obstacle. He saw it now.\r\nHe had learned values in his long exile.\r\n\r\nBut he was still ridiculously timid. This confusion of thought, of\r\nmental images rather, was due to a kind of fear, since worship ever is\r\nakin to awe. He was as nervous as a boy going up for a _viva voce_; and\r\nwith the excitement was also that unconquerable sinking--that horrid\r\nshrinking sensation that excessive shyness brings. Why in the world had\r\nhe come? Why had he telegraphed the very day after his arrival in\r\nEngland? Why had he not sent a tentative, tactful letter, feeling his\r\nway a little?\r\n\r\nVery slowly he walked up the drive, feeling that if a reasonable chance\r\nof escape presented itself he would almost take it. But all the windows\r\nstared so hard at him that retreat was really impossible now and though\r\nno faces were visible behind the curtains, all had seen him, possibly\r\nshe herself--his heart beat absurdly at the extravagant suggestion. Yet\r\nit was odd--he felt so certain of being seen, and that someone watched\r\nhim. He reached the wide stone steps that were clean as marble, and\r\nshrank from the mark his boots must make upon their spotlessness. In\r\ndesperation, then, before he could change his mind, he touched the bell.\r\nBut he did not hear it ring--mercifully; that irrevocable sound must\r\nhave paralyzed him altogether. If no one came to answer, he might still\r\nleave a card in the letter-box and slip away. Oh, how utterly he\r\ndespised himself for such a thought! A man of thirty with such a chicken\r\nheart was not fit to protect a child, much less a woman. And he recalled\r\nwith a little stab of pain that the man she married had been noted for\r\nhis courage, his determined action, his inflexible firmness in various\r\npublic situations, head and shoulders above lesser men. What presumption\r\non his own part ever to dream!... He remembered, too, with no apparent\r\nreason in particular, that this man had a grown-up son already, by a\r\nformer marriage.\r\n\r\nAnd still no one came to open that huge, contemptuous door with its so\r\nmenacing, so hostile air. His back was to it, as he carelessly twirled\r\nhis umbrella, but he felt its sneering expression behind him while it\r\nlooked him up and down. It seemed to push him away. The entire mansion\r\nfocused its message through that stern portal: Little timid men are not\r\nwelcomed here.\r\n\r\nHow well he remembered the house! How often in years gone by had he not\r\nstood and waited just like this, trembling with delight and\r\nanticipation, yet terrified lest the bell should be answered and the\r\ngreat door actually swung wide! Then, as now, he would have run, had he\r\ndared. He was still afraid--his worship was so deep. But in all these\r\nyears of exile in wild places, farming, mining, working for the position\r\nhe had at last attained, her face and the memory of her gracious\r\npresence had been his comfort and support, his only consolation, though\r\nnever his actual joy. There was so little foundation for it all, yet her\r\nsmile and the words she had spoken to him from time to time in friendly\r\nconversation had clung, inspired, kept him going--for he knew them all\r\nby heart. And more than once in foolish optimistic moods, he had\r\nimagined, greatly daring, that she possibly had meant more....\r\n\r\nHe touched the bell a second time--with the point of his umbrella. He\r\nmeant to go in, carelessly as it were, saying as lightly as might be,\r\n\"Oh, I'm back in England again--if you haven't _quite_ forgotten my\r\nexistence--I could not forego the pleasure of saying 'How-do-you-do?'\r\nand hearing that you are well ...,\" and the rest; then presently bow\r\nhimself easily out--into the old loneliness again. But he would at least\r\nhave seen her; he would have heard her voice, and looked into her\r\ngentle, amber eyes; he would have touched her hand. She might even ask\r\nhim to come in another day and see her! He had rehearsed it all a\r\nhundred times, as certain feeble temperaments do rehearse such scenes.\r\nAnd he came rather well out of that rehearsal, though always with an\r\naching heart, the old great yearnings unfulfilled. All the way across\r\nthe Atlantic he had thought about it, though with lessening confidence\r\nas the time drew near. The very night of his arrival in London he wrote,\r\nthen, tearing up the letter (after sleeping over it), he had telegraphed\r\nnext morning, asking if she would be in. He signed his surname--such a\r\nvery common name, alas! but surely she would know--and her reply,\r\n\"Please call 4:30,\" struck him as rather oddly worded. Yet here he was.\r\n\r\nThere was a rattle of the big door knob, that aggressive, hostile knob\r\nthat thrust out at him insolently like a fist of bronze. He started,\r\nangry with himself for doing so. But the door did not open. He became\r\nsuddenly conscious of the wilds he had lived in for so long; his clothes\r\nwere hardly fashionable; his voice probably had a twang in it, and he\r\nused tricks of speech that must betray the rough life so recently left.\r\nWhat would she think of him, now? He looked much older, too. And how\r\nbrusque it was to have telegraphed like that! He felt awkward, gauche,\r\ntongue-tied, hot and cold by turns. The sentences, so carefully\r\nrehearsed, fled beyond recovery.\r\n\r\nGood heavens--the door was open! It had been open for some minutes. It\r\nmoved noiselessly on big hinges. He acted automatically; he heard\r\nhimself asking if her ladyship was at home, though his voice was nearly\r\ninaudible. The next moment he was standing in the great, dim hall, so\r\npoignantly familiar, and the remembered perfume almost made him sway. He\r\ndid not hear the door close, but he knew. He was caught. The butler\r\nbetrayed an instant's surprise--or was it over-wrought imagination\r\nagain?--when he gave his name. It seemed to him--though only later did\r\nhe grasp the significance of that curious intuition--that the man had\r\nexpected another caller instead. The man took his card respectfully and\r\ndisappeared. These flunkeys were so marvellously trained. He was too\r\nlong accustomed to straight question and straight answer, but here, in\r\nthe Old Country, privacy was jealously guarded with such careful ritual.\r\n\r\nAnd almost immediately the butler returned, still expressionless, and\r\nshowed him into the large drawing-room on the ground floor that he knew\r\nso well. Tea was on the table--tea for one. He felt puzzled. \"If you\r\nwill have tea first, sir, her ladyship will see you afterwards,\" was\r\nwhat he heard. And though his breath came thickly, he asked the question\r\nthat forced itself out. Before he knew what he was saying he asked it,\r\n\"Is she ill?\" \"Oh, no, her ladyship is quite well, thank you, sir. If\r\nyou will have tea first, sir, her ladyship will see you afterwards.\" The\r\nhorrid formula was repeated, word for word. He sank into an armchair and\r\nmechanically poured out his own tea. What he felt he did not exactly\r\nknow. It seemed so unusual, so utterly unexpected, so unnecessary, too.\r\nWas it a special attention, or was it merely casual? That it could mean\r\nanything else did not occur to him. How was she busy, occupied--not\r\nhere to give him tea? He could not understand it. It seemed such a farce\r\nhaving tea alone like this--it was like waiting for an audience, it was\r\nlike a doctor's or a dentist's room. He felt bewildered, ill at ease,\r\ncheap.... But after ten years in primitive lands perhaps London usages\r\nhad changed in some extraordinary manner. He recalled his first\r\namazement at the motor-omnibuses, taxicabs, and electric tubes. All were\r\nnew. London was otherwise than when he left it. Piccadilly and the\r\nMarble Arch themselves had altered. And, with his reflection, a shade\r\nmore confidence stole in. She knew that he was there and presently she\r\nwould come in and speak with him, explaining everything by the mere fact\r\nof her delicious presence. He was ready for the ordeal, he would see\r\nher--and drop out again. It was worth all manner of pain, even of\r\nmortification. He was in her house, drinking her tea, sitting in a chair\r\nshe used herself perhaps. Only he would never dare to say a word or make\r\na sign that might betray his changeless secret. He still felt the boyish\r\nworshipper, worshipping in dumbness from a distance, one of a group of\r\nmany others like himself. Their dreams had faded, his had continued,\r\nthat was the difference. Memories tore and raced and poured upon him.\r\nHow sweet and gentle she had always been to him! He used to wonder\r\nsometimes.... Once, he remembered, he had rehearsed a declaration, but\r\nwhile rehearsing the big man had come in and captured her, though he had\r\nonly read the definite news long after by chance in an Arizona paper.\r\n\r\nHe gulped his tea down. His heart alternately leaped and stood still. A\r\nsort of numbness held him most of that dreadful interval, and no clear\r\nthought came at all. Every ten seconds his head turned towards the door\r\nthat rattled, seemed to move, yet never opened. But any moment now it\r\n_must_ open, and he would be in her very presence, breathing the same\r\nair with her. He would see her, charge himself with her beauty once more\r\nto the brim, and then go out again into the wilderness--the wilderness\r\nof life--without her, and not for a mere ten years but for always. She\r\nwas so utterly beyond his reach. He felt like a backwoodsman, he was a\r\nbackwoodsman.\r\n\r\nFor one thing only was he duly prepared, though he thought about it\r\nlittle enough--she would, of course, have changed. The photograph he\r\nowned, cut from an illustrated paper, was not true now. It might even be\r\na little shock perhaps. He must remember that. Ten years cannot pass\r\nover a woman without--\r\n\r\nBefore he knew it the door was open, and she was advancing quietly\r\ntowards him across the thick carpet that deadened sound. With both hands\r\noutstretched she came, and with the sweetest welcoming smile upon her\r\nparted lips he had seen in any human face. Her eyes were soft with joy.\r\nHis whole heart leaped within him; for the instant he saw her it all\r\nflashed clear as sunlight--that she knew and understood. She had always\r\nknown, had always understood. Speech came easily to him in a flood, had\r\nhe needed it, but he did not need it. It was all so adorably easy,\r\nsimple, natural, and true. He just took her hands--those welcoming,\r\noutstretched hands--in both of his own, and led her to the nearest sofa.\r\nHe was not even surprised at himself. Inevitably, out of depths of\r\ntruth, this meeting came about. And he uttered a little foolish\r\ncommonplace, because he feared the huge revulsion that his sudden glory\r\nbrought, and loved to taste it slowly:\r\n\r\n\"So you live here still?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, and here,\" she answered softly, touching his heart, and then her\r\nown. \"I am attached to this house, too, because _you_ used to come and\r\nsee me here, and because it was here I waited so long for you, and still\r\nwait. I shall never leave it--unless you change. You see, we live\r\ntogether here.\"\r\n\r\nHe said nothing. He leaned forward to take and hold her. The abrupt\r\nknowledge of it all somehow did not seem abrupt--it was as though he had\r\nknown it always; and the complete disclosure did not seem disclosure\r\neither--rather as though she told him something he had inexplicably left\r\nunrealized, yet not forgotten. He felt absolutely master of himself,\r\nyet, in a curious sense, outside of himself at the same time. His arms\r\nwere already open--when she gently held her hands up to prevent. He\r\nheard a faint sound outside the door.\r\n\r\n\"But you are free,\" he cried, his great passion breaking out and\r\nflooding him, yet most oddly well controlled, \"and I--\"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him in the softest, quietest whisper he had ever heard:\r\n\r\n\"You are not free, as I am free--not yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound outside came suddenly closer. It was a step. There was a faint\r\nclick on the handle of the door. In a flash, then, came the dreadful\r\nshock that overwhelmed him--the abrupt realization of the truth that was\r\nsomehow horrible--that Time, all these years, had left no mark upon her\r\nand that _she had not changed_. Her face was as young as when he saw her\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nWith it there came cold and darkness into the great room. He shivered\r\nwith cold, but an alien, unaccountable cold. Some great shadow dropped\r\nupon the entire earth, and though but a second could have passed before\r\nthe handle actually turned, and the other person entered, it seemed to\r\nhim like several minutes. He heard her saying this amazing thing that\r\nwas question, answer, and forgiveness all in one--this, at least, he\r\ndivined before the ghastly interruption came--\"But, George--if you had\r\nonly spoken--!\"\r\n\r\nWith ice in his blood he heard the butler saying that her ladyship would\r\nbe \"pleased\" to see him if he had finished his tea and would be \"so good\r\nas to bring the papers and documents upstairs with him.\" He had just\r\nsufficient control of certain muscles to stand upright and murmur that\r\nhe would come. He rose from a sofa that held no one but himself. All at\r\nonce he staggered. He really did not know exactly what happened, or how\r\nhe managed to stammer out the medley of excuses and semi-explanations\r\nthat battered their way through his brain and issued somehow in definite\r\nwords from his lips. Somehow or other he accomplished it. The sudden\r\nattack, the faintness, the collapse!... He vaguely remembered\r\nafterwards--with amazement too--the suavity of the butler as he\r\nsuggested telephoning for a doctor, and that he just managed to forbid\r\nit, refusing the offered glass of brandy as well, remembered contriving\r\nto stumble into the taxicab and give his hotel address with a final\r\nexplanation that he would call another day and \"bring the papers.\" It\r\nwas quite clear that his telegram had been attributed to someone else,\r\nsomeone \"with papers\"--perhaps a solicitor or architect. His name was\r\nsuch an ordinary one, there were so many Smiths. It was also clear that\r\nshe whom he had come to see and _had_ seen, no longer lived here in the\r\nflesh....\r\n\r\nAnd just as he left the hall he had the vision--mere fleeting glimpse it\r\nwas--of a tall, slim, girlish figure on the stairs asking if anything\r\nwas wrong, and realized vaguely through his atrocious pain that she was,\r\nof course, the wife of the son who had inherited....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH: A STORY\r\n\r\nBY KATHERINE RICKFORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were sitting round the fire after dinner--not an ordinary fire--one\r\nof those fires that has a little room all to itself with seats at each\r\nside of it to hold a couple of people or three.\r\n\r\nThe big dining room was paneled with oak. At the far end was a handsome\r\ndresser that dated back for generations. One's imagination ran riot when\r\none pictured the people who must have laid those pewter plates on the\r\nlong, narrow, solid table. Massive medieval chests stood against the\r\nwalls. Arms and parts of armor hung against the panelling; but one\r\nnoticed few of these things, for there was no light in the room save\r\nwhat the fire gave.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve. Games had been played. The old had vied with the\r\nyoung at snatching raisins from the burning snapdragon. The children had\r\nlong since gone to bed; it was time their elders followed them, but they\r\nlingered round the fire, taking turns at telling stories. Nothing very\r\nweird had been told; no one had felt any wish to peep over his shoulder\r\nor try to penetrate the darkness of the far end of the room; the\r\nomission caused a sensation of something wanting. From each one there\r\nthis thought went out, and so a sudden silence fell upon the party. It\r\nwas a girl who broke it--a mere child; she wore her hair up that night\r\nfor the first time, and that seemed to give her the right to sit up so\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Grady is going to tell one,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned to a middle-aged man in a deep armchair placed\r\nstraight in front of the fire. He was short, inclined to be fat, with a\r\nbald head and a pointed beard like the beards that sailors wear. It was\r\nplain that he was deeply conscious of the sudden turning of so much\r\nstrained yet forceful thought upon himself. He was restless in his chair\r\nas people are in a room that is overheated. He blinked his eyes as he\r\nlooked round the company. His lips twitched in a nervous manner. One\r\nside of him seemed to be endeavoring to restrain another side of him\r\nfrom a feverish desire to speak.\r\n\r\n\"It was this room that made me think of him,\" he said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, but it occurred to no one to prompt him. Every\r\none seemed to understand that he was going to speak, or rather that\r\nsomething inside him was going to speak, some force that craved\r\nexpression and was using him as a medium.\r\n\r\nThe little old man's pink face grew strangely calm, the animation that\r\nusually lit it was gone. One would have said that the girl who had\r\nstarted him already regretted the impulse, and now wanted to stop him.\r\nShe was breathing heavily, and once or twice made as though she would\r\nspeak to him, but no words came. She must have abandoned the idea, for\r\nshe fell to studying the company. She examined them carefully, one by\r\none. \"This one,\" she told herself, \"is so-and-so, and that one there\r\njust another so-and-so.\" She stared at them, knowing that she could not\r\nturn them to herself with her stare. They were just bodies kept working,\r\nso to speak, by some subtle sort of sentry left behind by the real\r\nselves that streamed out in pent-up thought to the little old man in the\r\nchair in front of the fire.\r\n\r\n\"His name was Joseph; at least they called him Joseph. He dreamed, you\r\nunderstand--dreams. He was an extraordinary lad in many ways. His\r\nmother--I knew her very well--had three children in quick succession,\r\nsoon after marriage; then ten years went by and Joseph was born. Quiet\r\nand reserved he always was, a self-contained child whose only friend was\r\nhis mother. People said things about him, you know how people talk. Some\r\nsaid he was not Clara's child at all, but that she had adopted him;\r\nothers, that her husband was not his father, and these put her change of\r\nmanner down to a perpetual struggle to keep her husband comfortably in\r\nthe dark. I always imagined that the boy was in some way aware of all\r\nthis gossip, for I noticed that he took a dislike to the people who\r\nspread it most.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man rested his elbows on the arms of his chair and let the\r\ntips of his fingers meet in front of him. A smile played about his\r\nmouth. He seemed to be searching among his reminiscences for the one\r\nthat would give the clearest portrait of Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway,\" he said at last, \"the boy was odd, there is no\r\ngainsaying the fact. I suppose he was eleven when Clara came down here\r\nwith her family for Christmas. The Coningtons owned the place then--Mrs.\r\nConington was Clara's sister. It was Christmas Eve, as it is now, many\r\nyears ago. We had spent a normal Christmas Eve; a little happier,\r\nperhaps, than usual by reason of the family re-union and because of the\r\npresence of so many children. We had eaten and drank, laughed and played\r\nand gone to bed.\r\n\r\n\"I woke in the middle of the night from sheer restlessness. Clara,\r\nknowing my weakness, had given me a fire in my room. I lit a cigarette,\r\nplayed with a book, and then, purely from curiosity, opened the door and\r\nlooked down the passage. From my door I could see the head of the\r\nstaircase in the distance; the opposite wing of the house, or the\r\npassage rather beyond the stairs, was in darkness. The reason I saw the\r\nstaircase at all was that the window you pass coming downstairs allowed\r\nthe moon to throw an uncertain light upon it, a weird light because of\r\nthe stained glass. I was arrested by the curious effect of this patch of\r\nlight in so much darkness when suddenly someone came into it, turned,\r\nand went downstairs. It was just like a scene in a theater; something\r\nwas about to happen that I was going to miss. I ran as I was,\r\nbarefooted, to the head of the stairs and looked over the banister. I\r\nwas excited, strung up, too strung up to feel the fright that I knew\r\nmust be with me. I remember the sensation perfectly. I knew that I was\r\nafraid, yet I did not feel fright.\r\n\r\n\"On the stairs nothing moved. The little hall down here was lost in\r\ndarkness. Looking over the banister I was facing the stained glass\r\nwindow. You know how the stairs run around three sides of the hall;\r\nwell, it occurred to me that if I went halfway down and stood under the\r\nwindow I should be able to keep the top of the stairs in sight and see\r\nanything that might happen in the hall. I crept down very cautiously and\r\nwaited under the window. First of all, I saw the suit of empty armor\r\njust outside the door here. You know how a thing like that, if you stare\r\nat it in a poor light, appears to move; well, it moved sure enough, and\r\nthe illusion was enhanced by clouds being blown across the moon. By the\r\nfire like this one can talk of these things rationally, but in the dead\r\nof night it is a different matter, so I went down a few steps to make\r\nsure of that armor, when suddenly something passed me on the stairs. I\r\ndid not hear it, I did not see it, I sensed it in no way, I just knew\r\nthat something had passed me on its way upstairs. I realized that my\r\nretreat was cut off, and with the knowledge fear came upon me.\r\n\r\n\"I had seen someone come down the stairs; that, at any rate, was\r\ndefinite; now I wanted to see him again. Any ghost is bad enough, but a\r\nghost that one can see is better than one that one can't. I managed to\r\nget past the suit of armor, but then I had to feel my way to these\r\ndouble doors here.\"\r\n\r\nHe indicated the direction of the doors by a curious wave of his hand.\r\nHe did not look toward them nor did any of the party. Both men and women\r\nwere completely absorbed in his story; they seemed to be mesmerized by\r\nthe earnestness of his manner. Only the girl was restless; she gave an\r\nimpression of impatience with the slowness with which he came to his\r\npoint. One would have said that she was apart from her fellows, an alien\r\namong strangers.\r\n\r\n\"So dense was the darkness that I made sure of finding the first door\r\nclosed, but it was not, it was wide open, and, standing between them, I\r\ncould feel that the other was open, too. I was standing literally in the\r\nwall of the house, and as I peered into the room, trying to make out\r\nsome familiar object, thoughts ran through my mind of people who had\r\nbeen bricked up in walls and left there to die. For a moment I caught\r\nthe spirit of the inside of a thick wall. Then suddenly I felt the\r\nsensation I have often read about but never experienced before: I knew\r\nthere was some one in the room. You are surprised, yes, but wait! I knew\r\nmore: I knew that some one was conscious of my presence. It occurred to\r\nme that whoever it was might want to get out of the door. I made room\r\nfor him to pass. I waited for him, made sure of him, began to feel\r\ngiddy, and then a man's voice, deep and clear:\r\n\r\n\"'There is some one there; who is it?'\r\n\r\n\"I answered mechanically, 'George Grady.'\r\n\r\n\"'I'm Joseph.'\r\n\r\n\"A match was drawn across a matchbox, and I saw the boy bending over a\r\ncandle waiting for the wick to catch. For a moment I thought he must be\r\nwalking in his sleep, but he turned to me quite naturally and said in\r\nhis own boyish voice:\r\n\r\n\"'Lost anything?'\r\n\r\n\"I was amazed at the lad's complete calm. I wanted to share my fright\r\nwith some one, instead I had to hide it from this boy. I was conscious\r\nof a curious sense of shame. I had watched him grow, taught him, praised\r\nhim, scolded him, and yet here he was waiting for an explanation of my\r\npresence in the dining room at that odd hour of the night.\r\n\r\n\"Soon he repeated the question, 'Lost anything?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' I said, and then I stammered, 'Have you?'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' he said with a little laugh. 'It's that room, I can't sleep in\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh,' I said. 'What's the matter with the room?'\r\n\r\n\"'It's the room I was killed in,' he said quite simply.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I had heard about his dreams, but I had had no direct\r\nexperience of them; when, therefore, he said that he had been killed in\r\nhis room I took it for granted that he had been dreaming again. I was at\r\na loss to know quite how to tackle him; whether to treat the whole thing\r\nas absurd and laugh it off as such, or whether to humor him and hear his\r\nstory. I got him upstairs to my room, sat him in a big armchair, and\r\npoked the fire into a blaze.\r\n\r\n\"'You've been dreaming again,' I said bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, no I haven't. Don't you run away with that idea.'\r\n\r\n\"His whole manner was so grown up that it was quite unthinkable to treat\r\nhim as the child he really was. In fact, it was a little uncanny, this\r\nman in a child's frame.\r\n\r\n\"'I was killed there,' he said again.\r\n\r\n\"'How do you mean, killed?' I asked him.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, killed--murdered. Of course it was years and years ago, I can't\r\nsay when; still I remember the room. I suppose it was the room that\r\nreminded me of the incident.'\r\n\r\n\"'Incident?' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"'What else? Being killed is only an incident in the existence of any\r\none. One makes a fuss about it at the time, of course, but really when\r\nyou come to think of it....'\r\n\r\n\"'Tell me about it,' I said, lighting a cigarette. He lit one too, that\r\nchild, and began.\r\n\r\n\"'You know my room is the only modern one in this old house. Nobody\r\nknows why it is modern. The reason is obvious. Of course it was made\r\nmodern after I was killed there. The funny thing is that I should have\r\nbeen put there. I suppose it was done for a purpose, because I--I----'\r\n\r\n\"He looked at me so fixedly I knew he would catch me if I lied.\r\n\r\n\"'What?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'Dream.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' I said, 'that is why you were put there.'\r\n\r\n\"'I thought so, and yet of all the rooms--but then, of course, no one\r\nknew. Anyhow I did not recognize the room until after I was in bed. I\r\nhad been asleep some time and then I woke suddenly. There is an old\r\nwheel-back chair there--the only old thing in the room. It is standing\r\nfacing the fire as it must have stood the night I was killed. The fire\r\nwas burning brightly, the pattern of the back of the chair was thrown in\r\nshadow across the ceiling. Now the night I was murdered the conditions\r\nwere exactly the same, so directly I saw that pattern on the ceiling I\r\nremembered the whole thing. I was not dreaming, don't think it, I was\r\nnot. What happened that night was this: I was lying in bed counting the\r\nparts of the back of that chair in shadow on the ceiling. I probably\r\ncould not get to sleep, you know the sort of thing, count up to a\r\nthousand and remember in the morning where you got to. Well, I was\r\ncounting those pieces when suddenly they were all obliterated, the whole\r\nback became a shadow, some one was sitting in the chair. Now, surely,\r\nyou understand that directly I saw the shadow of that chair on the\r\nceiling to-night I realized that I had not a moment to lose. At any\r\nmoment that same person might come back to that same chair and escape\r\nwould be impossible. I slipped from my bed as quickly as I could and ran\r\ndownstairs.'\r\n\r\n\"'But were you not afraid,' I asked, 'downstairs?'\r\n\r\n\"'That she might follow me? It was a woman, you know. No, I don't think\r\nI was. She does not belong downstairs. Anyhow she didn't.'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' I said. 'No.'\r\n\r\n\"My voice must have been out of control, for he caught me up at once.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't mean to say you saw her?' he said vehemently.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, no.'\r\n\r\n\"'You felt her?'\r\n\r\n\"'She passed me as I came downstairs,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'What can I have done to her that she follows me so?' He buried his\r\nface in his hands as though searching for an answer to his thought.\r\nSuddenly he looked up and stared at me.\r\n\r\n\"'Where had I got to? Oh yes, the murder. I can remember how startled I\r\nwas to see that shadow in the chair--startled, you know, but not really\r\nfrightened. I leaned up in bed and looked at the chair, and sure enough\r\na woman was sitting in it--a young woman. I watched her with a profound\r\ninterest until she began to turn in her chair, as I felt, to look at me;\r\nwhen she did that I shrank back in bed. I dared not meet her eyes. She\r\nmight not have had eyes, she might not have had a face. You know the\r\nsort of pictures that one sees when one glances back at all one's soul\r\nhas ever thought.\r\n\r\n\"'I got back in the bed as far as I could and peeped over the sheets at\r\nthe shadow on the ceiling. I was tired; frightened to death; I grew\r\nweary of watching. I must have fallen asleep, for suddenly the fire was\r\nalmost out, the pattern of the chair barely discernible, the shadow had\r\ngone. I raised myself with a sense of huge relief. Yes, the chair was\r\nempty, but, just think of it, the woman was on the floor, on her hands\r\nand knees, crawling toward the bed.\r\n\r\n\"'I fell back stricken with terror.\r\n\r\n\"'Very soon I felt a gentle pull at the counterpane. I thought I was in\r\na nightmare but too lazy or too comfortable to try to wake myself from\r\nit. I waited in an agony of suspense, but nothing seemed to be\r\nhappening, in fact I had just persuaded myself that the movement of the\r\ncounterpane was fancy when a hand brushed softly over my knee. There was\r\nno mistaking it, I could feel the long, thin fingers. Now was the time\r\nto do something. I tried to rouse myself, but all my efforts were\r\nfutile, I was stiff from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"'Although the hand was lost to me, outwardly, it now came within my\r\nrange of knowledge, if you know what I mean. I knew that it was groping\r\nits way along the bed feeling for some other part of me. At any moment I\r\ncould have said exactly where it had got to. When it was hovering just\r\nover my chest another hand knocked lightly against my shoulder. I\r\nfancied it lost, and wandering in search of its fellow.\r\n\r\n\"'I was lying on my back staring at the ceiling when the hands met; the\r\nweight of their presence brought a feeling of oppression to my chest. I\r\nseemed to be completely cut off from my body; I had no sort of\r\nconnection with any part of it, nothing about me would respond to my\r\nwill to make it move.\r\n\r\n\"'There was no sound at all anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"'I fell into a state of indifference, a sort of patient indifference\r\nthat can wait for an appointed time to come. How long I waited I cannot\r\nsay, but when the time came it found me ready. I was not taken by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"'There was a great upward rush of pent-up force released; it was like a\r\nmighty mass of men who have been lost in prayer rising to their feet. I\r\ncan't remember clearly, but I think the woman must have got on to my\r\nbed. I could not follow her distinctly, my whole attention was\r\nconcentrated on her hands. At the time I felt those fingers itching for\r\nmy throat.\r\n\r\n\"'At last they moved; slowly at first, then quicker; and then a\r\nlong-drawn swish like the sound of an over-bold wave that has broken too\r\nfar up the beach and is sweeping back to join the sea.'\r\n\r\n\"The boy was silent for a moment, then he stretched out his hand for the\r\ncigarettes.\r\n\r\n\"'You remember nothing else?' I asked him.\r\n\r\n\"'No,' he said. 'The next thing I remember clearly is deliberately\r\nbreaking the nursery window because it was raining and mother would not\r\nlet me go out.'\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's tension, then the strain of listening passed and\r\nevery one seemed to be speaking at once. The Rector was taking the story\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Grady,\" he said. \"How long do you suppose elapsed between the\r\nboy's murder and his breaking the nursery window?\"\r\n\r\nBut a young married woman in the first flush of her happiness broke in\r\nbetween them. She ridiculed the whole idea. Of course the boy was\r\ndreaming. She was drawing the majority to her way of thinking when, from\r\nthe corner where the girl sat, a hollow-sounding voice:\r\n\r\n\"And the boy? Where is he?\"\r\n\r\nThe tone of the girl's voice inspired horror, that fear that does not\r\nknow what it is it fears; one could see it on every face; on every face,\r\nthat is, but the face of the bald-headed little man; there was no horror\r\non his face; he was smiling serenely as he looked the girl straight in\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\n\"He's a man now,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Alive?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said the little old man, rubbing his hands together.\r\n\r\nShe tried to rise, but her frock had got caught between the chairs and\r\npulled her to her seat again. The man next her put out his hand to\r\nsteady her, but she dashed it away roughly. She looked round the party\r\nfor an instant for all the world like an animal at bay, then she sprang\r\nto her feet and charged blindly. They crowded round her to prevent her\r\nfalling; at the touch of their hands she stopped. She was out of breath\r\nas though she had been running.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" she said, pushing their hands from her. \"All right. I'll\r\ncome quietly. I did it.\"\r\n\r\nThey caught her as she fell and laid her on the sofa watching the color\r\nfade from her face.\r\n\r\nThe hostess, an old woman with white hair and a kind face, approached\r\nthe little old man; for once in her life she was roused to anger.\r\n\r\n\"I can't think how you could be so stupid,\" she said. \"See what you have\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did it for a purpose,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"For a purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have always thought that girl was the culprit. I have to thank you\r\nfor the opportunity you have given me of making sure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLAVECIN, BRUGES[4]\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE WHARTON EDWARDS\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: By permission of The Century Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA silent, grass-grown market-place, upon the uneven stones of which the\r\nsabots of a passing peasant clatter loudly. A group of sleepy-looking\r\nsoldiers in red trousers lolling about the wide portal of the Belfry,\r\nwhich rears aloft against the pearly sky\r\n\r\n    All the height it has\r\n    Of ancient stone.\r\n\r\nAs the chime ceases there lingers for a space a faint musical hum in the\r\nair; the stones seem to carry and retain the melody; one is loath to\r\nmove for fear of losing some part of the harmony.\r\n\r\nI feel an indescribable impulse to climb the four hundred odd steps;\r\nincomprehensible, for I detest steeple-climbing, and have no patience\r\nwith steeple-climbers.\r\n\r\nBefore I realize it, I am at the stairs. \"Hold, sir!\" from behind me.\r\n\"It is forbidden.\" In wretched French a weazen-faced little soldier\r\nexplains that repairs are about to be made in the tower, in consequence\r\nof which visitors are forbidden. A franc removes this military obstacle,\r\nand I press on.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the stairs is an old Flemish woman shelling peas, while\r\nover her shoulder peeps a tame magpie. A savory odor of stewing\r\nvegetables fills the air.\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish, sir?\" Many shrugs, gesticulations, and sighs of\r\nobjurgation, which are covered by a shining new five-franc piece, and\r\nshe produces a bunch of keys. As the door closes upon me the magpie\r\ngives a hoarse, gleeful squawk.\r\n\r\n... A huge, dim room with a vaulted ceiling. Against the wall lean\r\nancient stone statues, noseless and disfigured, crowned and sceptered\r\neffigies of forgotten lords and ladies of Flanders. High up on the wall\r\ntwo slitted Gothic windows, through which the violet light of day is\r\nstreaming. I hear the gentle coo of pigeons. To the right a low door,\r\nsome vanishing steps of stone, and a hanging hand-rope. Before I have\r\ntaken a dozen steps upward I am lost in the darkness; the steps are worn\r\nhollow and sloping, the rope is slippery--seems to have been waxed, so\r\nsmooth has it become by handling. Four hundred steps and over; I have\r\nlost track of the number, and stumble giddily upward round and round the\r\nslender stone shaft. I am conscious of low openings from time to\r\ntime--openings to what? I do not know. A damp smell exhales from them,\r\nand the air is cold upon my face as I pass them. At last a dim light\r\nabove. With the next turn a blinding glare of light, a moment's\r\nblankness, then a vast panorama gradually dawns upon me. Through the\r\nframe of stonework is a vast reach of grayish green bounded by the\r\nhorizon, an immense shield embossed with silvery lines of waterways, and\r\nstudded with clustering red-tiled roofs. A rim of pale yellow\r\nappears--the sand-dunes that line the coast--and dimly beyond a grayish\r\nfilm, evanescent, flashing--the North Sea.\r\n\r\nSomething flies through the slit from which I am gazing, and following\r\nits flight upward, I see a long beam crossing the gallery, whereon are\r\nperched an array of jackdaws gazing down upon me in wonder.\r\n\r\nI am conscious of a rhythmic movement about me that stirs the air, a\r\nmysterious, beating, throbbing sound, the machinery of the clock, which\r\nsome one has described as a \"heart of iron beating in a breast of\r\nstone.\"\r\n\r\nI lean idly in the narrow slit, gazing at the softened landscape, the\r\nexquisite harmony of the greens, grays, and browns, the lazily turning\r\narms of far-off mills, reminders of Cuyp, Van der Velde, Teniers,\r\nshadowy, mysterious recollections. I am conscious of uttering aloud some\r\ncommonplaces of delight. A slight and sudden movement behind me, a\r\nsmothered cough. A little old man in a black velvet coat stands looking\r\nup at me, twisting and untwisting his hands. There are ruffles at his\r\nthroat and wrists, and an amused smile spreads over his face, which is\r\ncleanly shaven, of the color of wax, with a tiny network of red lines\r\nover the cheek-bones, as if the blood had been forced there by some\r\nexcess of passion and had remained. He has heard my sentimental\r\nejaculation. I am conscious of the absurdity of the situation, and move\r\naside for him to pass. He makes a courteous gesture with one ruffled\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThere comes a prodigious rattling and grinding noise from above--then a\r\njangle of bells, some half-dozen notes in all. At the first stroke the\r\nold man closes his eyes, throws back his head, and follows the rhythm\r\nwith his long white hands, as though playing a piano. The sound dies\r\naway; the place becomes painfully silent; still the regular motion of\r\nthe old man's hands continues. A creepy, shivery feeling runs up and\r\ndown my spine; a fear of which I am ashamed seizes upon me.\r\n\r\n\"Fine pells, sare,\" says the little old man, suddenly dropping his\r\nhands, and fixing his eyes upon me. \"You sall not hear such pells in\r\nyour countree. But stay not here; come wis me, and I will show you the\r\nclavecin. You sall not see the clavecin yet? No?\"\r\n\r\nI had not, of course, and thanked him.\r\n\r\n\"You sall see Melchior, Melchior t'e Groote, t'e magnif'.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke we entered a room quite filled with curious machinery, a\r\nmedley of levers, wires, and rope above; below, two large cylinders\r\nstudded with shining brass points.\r\n\r\nHe sprang among the wires with a spidery sort of agility, caught one,\r\npulled and hung upon it with, all his weight. There came a r-r-r-r-r-r\r\nof fans and wheels, followed by a shower of dust; slowly one great\r\ncylinder began to revolve; wires and ropes reaching into the gloom above\r\nbegan to twitch convulsively; faintly came the jangle of far-off bells.\r\nThen came a pause, then a deafening _boom_, that well nigh stunned me.\r\nAs the waves of sound came and went, the little old man twisted and\r\nuntwisted his hands in delight, and ejaculated, \"Melchior you haf\r\nheeard, Melchior t'e Groote--t'e bourdon.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted to examine the machinery, but he impatiently seized my arm and\r\nalmost dragged me away saying, \"I will skow you--I will skow you. Come\r\nwis me.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a pocket he produced a long brass key and unlocked a door covered\r\nwith red leather, disclosing an up-leading flight of steps to which he\r\npushed me. It gave upon an octagon-shaped room with a curious floor of\r\nsheet-lead. Around the wall ran a seat under the diamond-paned Gothic\r\nwindows. From their shape I knew them to be the highest in the tower. I\r\nhad seen them from the square below many times, with the framework above\r\nupon which hung row upon row of bells.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room was a rude sort of keyboard, with pedals\r\nbelow, like those of a large organ. Fronting this construction sat a\r\nlong, high-backed bench. On the rack over the keyboard rested some\r\nsheets of music, which, upon examination, I found to be of parchment and\r\nwritten by hand. The notes were curious in shape, consisting of squares\r\nof black and diamonds of red upon the lines. Across the top of the page\r\nwas written, in a straggling hand, \"Van den Gheyn Nikolaas.\" I turned to\r\nthe little old man with the ruffles. \"Van den Gheyn!\" I said in\r\nsurprise, pointing to the parchment. \"Why, that is the name of the most\r\ncelebrated of _carillonneurs_, Van den Gheyn of Louvain.\" He untwisted\r\nhis hands and bowed. \"Eet ees ma name, mynheer--I am the\r\n_carillonneur_.\"\r\n\r\nI fancied that my face showed all too plainly the incredulity I felt,\r\nfor his darkened, and he muttered, \"You not belief, Engelsch? Ah, I show\r\nyou; then you belief, parehap,\" and with astounding agility seated\r\nhimself upon the bench before the clavecin, turned up the ruffles at his\r\nwrists, and literally threw himself upon the keys. A sound of thunder\r\naccompanied by a vivid flash of lightning filled the air, even as the\r\nfirst notes of the bells reached my ears. Involuntarily I glanced out of\r\nthe diamond-leaded window--dark clouds were all about us, the housetops\r\nand surrounding country were no longer to be seen. A blinding flash of\r\nlightning seemed to fill the room; the arms and legs of the little old\r\nman sought the keys and pedals with inconceivable rapidity; the music\r\ncrashed about us with a deafening din, to the accompaniment of the\r\nthunder, which seemed to sound in unison with the boom of the bourdon.\r\nIt was grandly terrible. The face of the little old man was turned upon\r\nme, but his eyes were closed. He seemed to find the pedals intuitively,\r\nand at every peal of thunder, which shook the tower to its foundations,\r\nhe would open his mouth, a toothless cavern, and shout aloud. I could\r\nnot hear the sounds for the crashing of the bells. Finally, with a last\r\ndeafening crash of iron rods and thunderbolts, the noise of the bells\r\ngradually died away. Instinctively I had glanced above when the crash\r\ncame, half expecting to see the roof torn off.\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better go down,\" I said. \"This tower has been struck by\r\nlightning several times, and I imagine that discretion--\"\r\n\r\nI don't know what more I said, for my eyes rested upon the empty bench,\r\nand the bare rack where the music had been. The clavecin was one mass of\r\ntwisted iron rods, tangled wires, and decayed, worm-eaten woodwork; the\r\nlittle old man had disappeared. I rushed to the red leather-covered\r\ndoor; it was fast. I shook it in a veritable terror; it would not yield.\r\nWith a bound I reached the ruined clavecin, seized one of the pedals,\r\nand tore it away from the machine. The end was armed with an iron point.\r\nThis I inserted between the lock and the door. I twisted the lock from\r\nthe worm-eaten wood with one turn of the wrist, the door opened, and I\r\nalmost fell down the steep steps. The second door at the bottom was\r\nalso closed. I threw my weight against it once, twice; it gave, and I\r\nhalf slipped, half ran down the winding steps in the darkness.\r\n\r\nOut at last into the fresh air of the lower passage! At the noise I made\r\nin closing the ponderous door came forth the old _custode_.\r\n\r\nIn my excitement I seized her by the arm, saying, \"Who was the little\r\nold man in the black velvet coat with the ruffles? Where is he?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me in a stupid manner. \"Who is he,\" I repeated--\"the\r\nlittle old man who played the clavecin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Little old man, sir? I don't know,\" said the crone. \"There has been no\r\none in the tower to-day but yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGEIA\r\n\r\nBY EDGAR ALLAN POE\r\n\r\n     \"And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the\r\n     mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great\r\n     will prevading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth\r\n     not yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save\r\n     only through the weakness of his feeble will.\"--JOSEPH\r\n     GLANVILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely where, I\r\nfirst became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years have since\r\nelapsed, and my memory is feeble through much suffering. Or, perhaps, I\r\ncannot _now_ bring these points to mind, because, in truth, the\r\ncharacter of my beloved, her rare learning, her singular yet placid\r\ncaste of beauty, and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low\r\nmusical language, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and\r\nstealthily progressive, that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet I\r\nbelieve that I met her first and most frequently in some large, old,\r\ndecaying city near the Rhine. Of her family I have surely heard her\r\nspeak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia!\r\nLigeia! Buried in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to\r\ndeaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word\r\nalone--by Ligeia--that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of\r\nher who is no more. And now, while I write, a recollection flashes upon\r\nme that I have _never known_ the paternal name of her who was my friend\r\nand my betrothed, and who became the partner of my studies, and finally\r\nthe wife of my bosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia?\r\nOr was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no\r\ninquiries upon this point? Or was it rather a caprice of my own--a\r\nwildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion?\r\nI but indistinctly recall the fact itself--what wonder that I have\r\nutterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it?\r\nAnd, indeed, if ever that spirit which is entitled Romance--if ever she,\r\nthe wan and the misty-winged Ashtophet of idolatrous Egypt--presided, as\r\nthey tell, over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nThere is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me not. It is\r\nthe _person_ of Ligeia. In stature she was tall, somewhat slender, and,\r\nin her latter days, even emaciated. I would in vain attempt to portray\r\nthe majesty, the quiet ease of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible\r\nlightness and elasticity of her footfall. She came and departed as a\r\nshadow. I was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study,\r\nsave by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble\r\nhand upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It\r\nwas the radiance of an opium-dream--an airy and spirit-lifting vision\r\nmore wildly divine than the fantasies which hovered about the slumbering\r\nsouls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of that\r\nregular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the\r\nclassical labors of the heathen. \"There is no exquisite beauty,\" says\r\nBacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the forms and _genera_\r\nof beauty, \"without some strangeness in the proportion.\" Yet,\r\nalthough I saw that the features of Ligeia were not of a classic\r\nregularity--although I perceived that her loveliness was indeed\r\nexquisite and felt that there was much of strangeness pervading it--yet\r\nI have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own\r\nperception of \"the strange.\" I examined the contour of the lofty and\r\npale forehead; it was faultless--how cold indeed that word when applied\r\nto a majesty so divine--the skin rivalling the purest ivory; the\r\ncommanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the regions above\r\nthe temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant and\r\nnaturally-curling tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric\r\nepithet, \"hyacinthine\"! I looked at the delicate outlines of the nose,\r\nand nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld a\r\nsimilar perfection. There were the same luxurious smoothness of surface,\r\nthe same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same\r\nharmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I regarded the\r\nsweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly--the\r\nmagnificent turn of the short upper lip, the soft, voluptuous slumber of\r\nthe under, the dimples which sported, and the color which spoke, the\r\nteeth glancing back, with a brilliancy almost startling, every ray of\r\nthe holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid, yet most\r\nexultingly radiant of all smiles. I scrutinized the formation of the\r\nchin, and here, too, I found the gentleness of breadth, the softness\r\nand the majesty, the fulness and the spirituality of the Greek--the\r\ncontour which the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the\r\nson of the Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.\r\n\r\nFor eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have been,\r\ntoo, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which Lord\r\nVerulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger than the ordinary\r\neyes of our own race. They were even fuller than the fullest of the\r\ngazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at\r\nintervals--in moments of intense excitement--that this peculiarity\r\nbecame more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was\r\nher beauty--in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps--the beauty of\r\nbeings either above or apart from the earth--the beauty of the fabulous\r\nHouri of the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black,\r\nand far over them hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows, slightly\r\nirregular in outline, had the same tint. The \"strangeness,\" however,\r\nwhich I found in the eyes, was of a nature distinct from the formation,\r\nor the color, or the brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be\r\nreferred to the expression. Ah, word of no meaning, behind whose vast\r\nlatitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the\r\nspiritual! The expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long hours have\r\nI pondered upon it! How have I, through the whole of a midsummer night,\r\nstruggled to fathom it! What was it--that something more profound than\r\nthe well of Democritus--which lay far within the pupils of my beloved?\r\nWhat _was_ it? I was possessed with a passion to discover. Those eyes,\r\nthose large, those shining, those divine orbs--they became to me twin\r\nstars of Leda, and I to them devoutest of astrologers.\r\n\r\nThere is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the\r\nscience of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the fact--never, I\r\nbelieve, noticed in the schools--that in our endeavors to recall to\r\nmemory something long forgotten, we often find ourselves upon the very\r\nverge of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. And\r\nthus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes, have I\r\nfelt approaching the full knowledge of their expression--felt it\r\napproaching, yet not quite be mine--and so at length entirely depart!\r\nAnd (strange, oh strangest mystery of all!) I found in the commonest\r\nobjects of the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. I\r\nmean to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia's beauty passed\r\ninto my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived from many\r\nexistences in the material world a sentiment such as I felt always\r\naround, within me, by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not the more\r\ncould I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it. I\r\nrecognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a\r\nrapidly-growing vine, in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a\r\nchrysalis, a stream of running water. I have felt it in the ocean, in\r\nthe falling of a meteor. I have felt it in the glances of unusually aged\r\npeople. And there are one or two stars in heaven, (one especially, a\r\nstar of the sixth magnitude, double and changeable, to be found near the\r\nlarge star in Lyra) in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made\r\naware of the feeling. I have been filled with it by certain sounds from\r\nstringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from books. Among\r\ninnumerable other instances, I well remember something in a volume of\r\nJoseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely from its quaintness--who shall\r\nsay?) never failed to inspire me with the sentiment: \"And the will\r\ntherein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will,\r\nwith its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by\r\nnature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto\r\ndeath utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.\"\r\n\r\nLength of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to trace,\r\nindeed, some remote connection between this passage in the English\r\nmoralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An intensity in\r\nthought, action, or speech was possibly, in her, a result or at least an\r\nindex of that gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse,\r\nfailed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence. Of\r\nall the women whom I have ever known, she--the outwardly calm, the\r\never-placid Ligeia--was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous\r\nvultures of stern passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate,\r\nsave by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so\r\ndelighted and appalled me, by the almost magical melody, modulation,\r\ndistinctness, and placidity of her very low voice, and by the fierce\r\nenergy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of\r\nutterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the learning of Ligeia; it was immense, such as I have\r\nnever known in woman. In the classical tongues was she deeply\r\nproficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the\r\nmodern dialects of Europe, I have never known her at fault. Indeed upon\r\nany theme of the most admired, because simply the most abstruse of the\r\nboasted erudition of the academy, have I ever found Ligeia at fault? How\r\nsingularly, how thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has\r\nforced itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said her\r\nknowledge was such as I have never known in woman--but where breathes\r\nthe man who has traversed, and successfully, all the wide areas of\r\nmoral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw not then what I now\r\nclearly perceive, that the acquisitions of Ligeia were gigantic, were\r\nastounding; yet I was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to\r\nresign myself, with a child-like confidence, to her guidance through the\r\nchaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily\r\noccupied during the earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a\r\ntriumph, with how vivid a delight, with how much of all that is ethereal\r\nin hope, did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but little\r\nsought--but less known--that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding\r\nbefore me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path I might at\r\nlength pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to\r\nbe forbidden!\r\n\r\nHow poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after some\r\nyears, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to themselves\r\nand fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child groping benighted. Her\r\npresence, her readings alone, rendered vividly luminous the many\r\nmysteries of the transcendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting\r\nthe radiant luster of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew\r\nduller than Saturnian lead. And now those eyes shone less and less\r\nfrequently upon the pages over which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild\r\neyes blazed with a too, too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became\r\nof the transparent waxen hue of the grave; and the blue veins upon the\r\nlofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the most\r\ngentle emotion. I saw that she must die--and I struggled desperately in\r\nspirit with the grim Azrael. And the struggles of the passionate wife\r\nwere, to my astonishment, even more energetic than my own. There had\r\nbeen much in her stern nature to impress me with the belief that, to\r\nher, death would have come without its terrors; but not so. Words are\r\nimpotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with\r\nwhich she wrestled with the Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the pitiable\r\nspectacle. I would have soothed, I would have reasoned, but, in the\r\nintensity of her wild desire for life--for life--_but_ for life--solace\r\nand reason were alike the uttermost of folly. Yet not until the last\r\ninstance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was\r\nshaken the external placidity of her demeanor. Her voice grew more\r\ngentle--grew more low--yet I would not wish to dwell upon the wild\r\nmeaning of the quietly uttered words. My brain reeled as I hearkened,\r\nentranced, to a melody more than mortal, to assumptions and aspirations\r\nwhich mortality had never before known.\r\n\r\nThat she loved me I should not have doubted, and I might have been\r\neasily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have reigned no\r\nordinary passion. But in death only was I fully impressed with the\r\nstrength of her affection. For long hours, detaining my hand, would she\r\npour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate\r\ndevotion amounted to idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by\r\nsuch confessions? How had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal of\r\nmy beloved in the hour of her making them? But upon this subject I\r\ncannot bear to dilate. Let me say only, that in Ligeia's more than\r\nwomanly abandonment to a love, alas! all unmerited, all unworthily\r\nbestowed, I at length recognized the principle of her longing, with so\r\nwildly earnest a desire, for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly\r\naway. It is this wild longing--it is this eager vehemence of desire for\r\nlife--but for life--that I have no power to portray, no utterance\r\ncapable of expressing.\r\n\r\nAt high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me\r\nperemptorily to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses composed by\r\nherself not many days before. I obeyed her. They were these:\r\n\r\n    Lo! 'tis a gala night\r\n      Within the lonesome latter years!\r\n    An angel throng, bewinged, bedight\r\n      In veils, and drowned in tears,\r\n    Sit in a theater, to see\r\n      A play of hopes and fears,\r\n    While the orchestra breathes fitfully\r\n      The music of the spheres.\r\n\r\n    Mimes, in the form of God on high,\r\n      Mutter and mumble low,\r\n    And hither and thither fly;\r\n      Mere puppets they, who come and go\r\n    At bidding of vast formless things\r\n      That shift the scenery to and fro,\r\n    Flapping from out their condor wings\r\n      Invisible Woe!\r\n\r\n    That motley drama!--oh, be sure\r\n      It shall not be forgot!\r\n    With its Phantom chased for evermore,\r\n      By a crowd that seize it not,\r\n    Through a circle that ever returneth in\r\n      To the self-same spot;\r\n    And much of Madness, and more of Sin\r\n      And Horror, the soul of the plot!\r\n\r\n    But see, amid the mimic rout\r\n      A crawling shape intrude!\r\n    A blood-red thing that writhes from out\r\n      The scenic solitude!\r\n    It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal\r\n      The mimes become its food,\r\n    And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs\r\n      In human gore imbued.\r\n\r\n    Out--out are the lights--out all!\r\n      And over each quivering form,\r\n    The curtain, a funeral pall,\r\n      Comes down with the rush of a storm--\r\n    And the angels, all pallid and wan,\r\n      Uprising, unveiling, affirm\r\n    That the play is the tragedy, \"Man,\"\r\n      And its hero, the Conqueror Worm.\r\n\r\n\"O God!\" half-shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending her\r\narms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of these lines,\r\n\"O God! O Divine Father! Shall these things be undeviatingly so? Shall\r\nthis conqueror be not once conquered? Are we not part and parcel in\r\nThee? Who--who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor? Man\r\ndoth not yield him to the angels, _nor unto death utterly_, save only\r\nthrough the weakness of his feeble will.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white arms to\r\nfall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as she breathed her\r\nlast sighs, there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips. I\r\nbent to them my ear, and distinguished again, the concluding words of\r\nthe passage in Glanvill: \"_Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor\r\nunto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will._\"\r\n\r\nShe died, and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no longer\r\nendure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city\r\nby the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls wealth. Ligeia had\r\nbrought me far more, very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of\r\nmortals. After a few months, therefore, of weary and aimless wandering,\r\nI purchased and put in some repair an abbey which I shall not name in\r\none of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair England. The\r\ngloomy and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of\r\nthe domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories connected with\r\nboth, had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which\r\nhad driven me into that remote and unsocial region of the country. Yet,\r\nalthough the external abbey with its verdant decay hanging about it\r\nsuffered but little alteration, I gave way with a child-like perversity,\r\nand perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a display\r\nof more than regal magnificence within. For such follies, even in\r\nchildhood, I had imbibed a taste, and now they came back to me as if in\r\nthe dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even of incipient madness\r\nmight have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in\r\nthe solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture, in the\r\nBedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! I had become a bounden\r\nslave in the trammels of opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a\r\ncoloring from my dreams. But these absurdities I must not pause to\r\ndetail. Let me speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in\r\na moment of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride--as the\r\nsuccessor of the unforgotten Ligeia--the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady\r\nRowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.\r\n\r\nThere is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of\r\nthat bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where were the\r\nsouls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through thirst of gold,\r\nthey permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment _so_ bedecked, a\r\nmaiden and a daughter so beloved? I have said that I minutely remember\r\nthe details of the chamber, yet I am sadly forgetful on topics of deep\r\nmoment; and here there was no system, no keeping, in the fantastic\r\ndisplay, to take hold upon the memory. The room lay in a high turret of\r\nthe castellated abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size.\r\nOccupying the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole\r\nwindow--an immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice--a single pane,\r\nand tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or moon\r\npassing through it fell with a ghastly luster on the objects within.\r\nOver the upper portion of this huge window extended the trellis-work of\r\nan aged vine which clambered up the massy walls of the turret. The\r\nceiling, of gloomy-looking oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and\r\nelaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a\r\nsemi-Gothic, semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of\r\nthis melancholy vaulting depended, by a single chain of gold with long\r\nlinks, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in pattern, and with\r\nmany perforations so contrived that there writhed in and out of them, as\r\nif endued with a serpent vitality, a continual succession of\r\nparti-colored fires.\r\n\r\nSome few ottomans and golden candelabra of Eastern figure were in\r\nvarious stations about; and there was the couch, too--the bridal\r\ncouch--of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony, with\r\na pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the chamber stood on\r\nend a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings\r\nover against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture.\r\nBut in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the chief fantasy of all.\r\nThe lofty walls, gigantic in height--even unproportionably so--were hung\r\nfrom summit to foot in vast folds with a heavy and massive-looking\r\ntapestry--tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet on\r\nthe floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed, as a canopy\r\nfor the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the curtains which partially\r\nshaded the window. The material was the richest cloth of gold. It was\r\nspotted all over, at irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about\r\na foot in diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most\r\njetty black. But these figures partook of the true character of the\r\narabesque only when regarded from a single point of view. By a\r\ncontrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very remote period of\r\nantiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one entering the room\r\nthey bore the appearance of simple monstrosities, but upon a farther\r\nadvance this appearance gradually departed; and, step by step as the\r\nvisitor moved his station in the chamber he saw himself surrounded by an\r\nendless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to the superstition\r\nof the Norman, or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk. The\r\nphantasmagoric effect was vastly heightened by the artificial\r\nintroduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the\r\ndraperies--giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.\r\n\r\nIn halls such as these--in a bridal chamber such as this--I passed, with\r\nthe Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first month of our\r\nmarriage--passed them with but little disquietude. That my wife dreaded\r\nthe fierce moodiness of my temper, that she shunned me, and loved me but\r\nlittle, I could not help perceiving; but it gave me rather pleasure than\r\notherwise. I loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to\r\nman. My memory flew back--oh, with what intensity of regret!--to Ligeia,\r\nthe beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. I revelled in\r\nrecollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her ethereal\r\nnature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then, did my\r\nspirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own. In\r\nthe excitement of my opium dreams (for I was habitually fettered in the\r\nshackles of the drug) I would call aloud upon her name, during the\r\nsilence of the night, or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by\r\nday, as if, through the wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the\r\nconsuming ardor of my longing for the departed, I could restore her to\r\nthe pathway she had abandoned--ah, could it be for ever?--upon the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAbout the commencement of the second month of the marriage the Lady\r\nRowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her recovery was\r\nslow. The fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy; and in\r\nher perturbed state of half-slumber she spoke of sounds and of motions\r\nin and about the chamber of the turret which I concluded had no\r\norigin save in the distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the\r\nphantasmagoric influences of the chamber itself. She became at length\r\nconvalescent--finally, well. Yet but a brief period elapsed ere a second\r\nmore violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering, and from\r\nthis attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether recovered.\r\nHer illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming character and of more\r\nalarming recurrence, defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions\r\nof her physicians. With the increase of the chronic disease, which had\r\nthus, apparently, taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be\r\neradicated by human means, I could not fail to observe a similar\r\nincrease in the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her\r\nexcitability by trivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more\r\nfrequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds--of the slight sounds--and\r\nof the unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly\r\nalluded.\r\n\r\nOne night near the closing in of September she pressed this distressing\r\nsubject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention. She had just\r\nawakened from an unquiet slumber, and I had been watching, with feelings\r\nhalf of anxiety, half of vague terror, the workings of her emaciated\r\ncountenance. I sat by the side of her ebony bed, upon one of the\r\nottomans of India. She partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low\r\nwhisper, of sounds which she then heard, but which I could not hear, of\r\nmotions which she then saw, but which I could not perceive. The wind was\r\nrushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her (what,\r\nlet me confess it, I could not all believe) that those almost\r\ninarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of the figures\r\nupon the wall, were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of\r\nthe wind. But a deadly pallor overspreading her face had proved to me\r\nthat my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be\r\nfainting, and no attendants were within call. I remembered where was\r\ndeposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her\r\nphysicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. But as I\r\nstepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances of a\r\nstartling nature attracted my attention. I had felt that some palpable\r\nalthough invisible object had passed lightly by my person; and I saw\r\nthat there lay upon the golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich\r\nluster thrown from the censer, a shadow--a faint, indefinite shadow of\r\nangelic aspect, such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade. But\r\nI was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and\r\nheeded these things but little, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having\r\nfound the wine, I recrossed the chamber and poured out a gobletful which\r\nI held to the lips of the fainting lady. She had now partially\r\nrecovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while I sank upon an\r\nottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person. It was then that\r\nI became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet and near\r\nthe couch; and in a second after as Rowena was in the act of raising the\r\nwine to her lips I saw, or may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the\r\ngoblet, as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room,\r\nthree or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby-colored fluid. If this\r\nI saw--not so Rowena. She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly, and I\r\nforbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must, after all, I\r\nconsidered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination,\r\nrendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady, by the opium, and by\r\nthe hour.\r\n\r\nYet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately\r\nsubsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the worse\r\ntook place in the disorder of my wife, so that, on the third subsequent\r\nnight the hands of her menials prepared her for the tomb, and on the\r\nfourth I sat alone with her shrouded body in that fantastic chamber\r\nwhich had received her as my bride. Wild visions, opium-engendered,\r\nfluttered, shadow-like, before me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the\r\nsarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures of the\r\ndrapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer\r\noverhead. My eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a\r\nformer night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had\r\nseen the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no longer;\r\nand breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid\r\nand rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me a thousand memories\r\nof Ligeia--and then came back upon my heart with the turbulent violence\r\nof a flood the whole of that unutterable woe with which I had regarded\r\n_her_ thus enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of\r\nbitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing\r\nupon the body of Rowena.\r\n\r\nIt might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later--for I had\r\ntaken no note of time--when a sob, low, gentle, but very distinct,\r\nstartled me from my revery. I _felt_ that it came from the bed of\r\nebony--the bed of death. I listened in an agony of superstitious\r\nterror--but there was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vision\r\nto detect any motion in the corpse--but there was not the slightest\r\nperceptible. Yet I could not have been deceived. I _had_ heard the\r\nnoise, however faint, and my soul was awakened within me. I resolutely\r\nand perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes\r\nelapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the\r\nmystery. At length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble and\r\nbarely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and\r\nalong the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of\r\nunutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality has no\r\nsufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease to beat, my\r\nlimbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of duty finally operated to\r\nrestore my self-possession. I could no longer doubt that we had been\r\nprecipitate in our preparations--that Rowena still lived. It was\r\nnecessary that some immediate exertion be made, yet the turret was\r\naltogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the\r\nservants--there were none within call, and I had no means of summoning\r\nthem to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes--and this I\r\ncould not venture to do. I therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to\r\ncall back the spirit still hovering. In a short period it was certain,\r\nhowever, that a relapse had taken place, the color disappeared from both\r\neyelid and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the\r\nlips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression\r\nof death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness overspread rapidly the\r\nsurface of the body; and all the usual rigorous stiffness immediately\r\nsupervened. I fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which I had\r\nbeen so startlingly aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate\r\nwaking visions of Ligeia.\r\n\r\nAn hour thus elapsed, when--could it be possible?--I was a second time\r\naware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed. I\r\nlistened--in extremity of horror. The sound came again--it was a sigh.\r\nRushing to the corpse, I saw--distinctly saw--a tremor upon the lips. In\r\na minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the pearly\r\nteeth. Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which\r\nhad hitherto reigned there alone. I felt that my vision grew dim, that\r\nmy reason wandered, and it was only by a violent effort that I at length\r\nsucceeded in nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had\r\npointed out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon\r\nthe cheek and throat, a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame,\r\nthere was even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady _lived_; and\r\nwith redoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of restoration. I\r\nchafed and bathed the temples and the hands and used every exertion\r\nwhich experience and no little medical reading could suggest. But in\r\nvain. Suddenly, the color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed\r\nthe expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body\r\ntook upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense\r\nrigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of\r\nthat which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.\r\n\r\nAnd again I sunk into visions of Ligeia--and again, (what marvel that I\r\nshudder while I write?) _again_ there reached my ears a low sob from the\r\nregion of the ebony bed. But why should I minutely detail the\r\nunspeakable horrors of that night? Why should I pause to relate how,\r\ntime after time, until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous\r\ndrama of revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only\r\ninto a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each agony\r\nwore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe; and how each\r\nstruggle was succeeded by I know not what of wild change in the personal\r\nappearance of the corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who had\r\nbeen dead, once again stirred--and now more vigorously than hitherto,\r\nalthough arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter\r\nhopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or to move, and\r\nremained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of\r\nviolent emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible,\r\nthe least consuming. The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more\r\nvigorously than before. The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy\r\ninto the countenance, the limbs relaxed, and, save that the eyelids were\r\nyet pressed heavily together and that the bandages and draperies of the\r\ngrave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I might have\r\ndreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off utterly the fetters of Death.\r\nBut if this idea was not even then altogether adopted, I could at least\r\ndoubt no longer, when arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble\r\nsteps, with closed eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a\r\ndream, the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into\r\nthe middle of the apartment.\r\n\r\nI trembled not--I stirred not--for a crowd of unutterable fancies\r\nconnected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure, rushing\r\nhurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed--had chilled me into stone. I\r\nstirred not--but gazed upon the apparition. There was a mad disorder in\r\nmy thoughts--a tumult unappeasable. Could it, indeed, be the living\r\nRowena who confronted me? Could it indeed be Rowena at all--the\r\nfair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, _why_\r\nshould I doubt it? The bandage lay heavily about the mouth--but then\r\nmight it not be the mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the\r\ncheeks--there were the roses as in her noon of life--yes, these might\r\nindeed be the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,\r\nwith its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?--but _had she\r\nthen grown taller since her malady_? What inexpressible madness seized\r\nme with that thought! One bound, and I had reached her feet. Shrinking\r\nfrom my touch she let fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly\r\ncerements which had confined it, and there streamed forth into the\r\nrushing atmosphere of the chamber huge masses of long and dishevelled\r\nhair; _it was blacker than the raven wings of midnight_! And now slowly\r\nopened the eyes of the figure which stood before me. \"Here then, at\r\nleast,\" I shrieked aloud, \"can I never--can I never be mistaken--these\r\nare the full and the black, and the wild eyes of my lost love--of the\r\nLady--of the LADY LIGEIA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYLPH AND THE FATHER[5]\r\n\r\nBy ELSA BARKER\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: By permission of the author of _War Letters of the Living\r\nDead Man_ and Mitchell Kennerley.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing yesterday along the line where the great French army stands\r\nbefore its powerful opponent, and marking the spirit of courage and\r\naspiration which makes it seem like a long line of living light, I saw a\r\nfamiliar face in the regions outside the physical.\r\n\r\nI paused, highly pleased at the encounter, and the sylph--for it was a\r\nsylph whom I met--paused also with a little smile of recognition.\r\n\r\nDo you recall in my former book the story of a sylph, Meriline, who was\r\nthe companion and familiar of a student of magic who lived in the rue de\r\nVaugirard in Paris?\r\n\r\nIt was Meriline that I met above the line of light which shows to\r\nwanderers in the astral regions where the soldiers of _la belle France_\r\nfight and die for the same ideal which inspired Jeanne d'Arc--to drive\r\nthe foreigner out of France.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your friend and master?\" I asked the sylph, and she pointed\r\nbelow to a trench which spoke loud its determination to conquer.\r\n\r\n\"I am here, to be still with him,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"And can you speak to him here?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I can always speak with him,\" she answered. \"I have been very useful to\r\nhim--and to France.\"\r\n\r\n\"To France?\" I enquired, with growing interest.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! When his commanding officer wants to know what is being\r\nplotted over there, he often asks my friend, and my friend asks me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" I thought, \"the French are an inspired people, when the\r\nofficers of armies ask guidance from the realm of the invisible! But had\r\nnot Jeanne her visions?\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you gain the information desired?\" I asked, drawing nearer\r\nto Meriline, who seemed more serious than when we met some years before\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" she answered, \"I go over there and look around me. I have learned\r\nwhat to look for, he has taught me, and when I bring him news he rewards\r\nme with more love.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you love him still, as of old?\"\r\n\r\n\"As of old?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, as you did back there in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time must have passed slowly with you,\" said the sylph, \"if you call a\r\nfew years ago 'as of old'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are a few years, then, as nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few years are as nothing to me,\" she replied. \"I have lived a long\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know the future of your friend?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nA puzzled look came over the face of Meriline, and she said, slowly:\r\n\r\n\"I used to know everything that would happen to him, because I could\r\nread his will, and whatever he willed came to pass; but since we have\r\nbeen out here he seems to have lost his will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lost his will!\" I exclaimed, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, lost his will; for he prays continually to a great Being whom he\r\nloves far more than me, and he always prays one prayer, 'Thy will be\r\ndone!' It used to be his will which was always done; but now, as I say,\r\nhe seems to have lost his will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" I said, \"it is true of the will as was once said of the life,\r\nand he that loses his will shall find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he will find it soon,\" she answered, \"for in the old days he was\r\nalways giving me interesting things to do, to help him achieve the\r\npurposes of his will, and now he only sends me over there. I don't like\r\n_over there_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because my friend is menaced by something over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what has his will to do with that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, even about that, he says all day to the great Being that he loves\r\nso much more than me, 'Thy will be done.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you could learn to say it, too?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I say it after him sometimes; but I don't know what it means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you never heard of God?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of many gods, of Isis and Osiris and Set, and of Horus,\r\nthe son of Osiris.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is it to one of these that he says, 'Thy will be done'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! It is not to any of the gods that he used to call upon in his\r\nmagical working. This is some new god that he has found.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or the oldest of all gods that he has returned to,\" I suggested. \"What\r\ndoes he call Him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our Father who art in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you also should learn to say 'Thy will be done' to our Father who is\r\nin heaven,\" I said, \"it might help you toward the attainment of that\r\nsoul you were wanting and waiting for, when last we met in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could our Father help me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was He who gave souls to men,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the sylph were brilliant with something almost human.\r\n\r\n\"And could He give a soul to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is said that He _can_ do anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will ask Him for a soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"But to ask Him for a soul,\" I said, \"is not to pray the prayer your\r\nfriend prays.\"\r\n\r\n\"He only says----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know. Suppose you say it after him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, if you will tell me what it means. I like to do what my friend\r\ndoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Thy will be done,'\" I said, \"when addressed to the Father in heaven,\r\nmeans that we give up all our desires, whether for pleasure or love or\r\nhappiness, or anything else, and lay all those desires at His feet,\r\nsacrificing all we have or hope for to Him, because we love Him more\r\nthan ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a strange way to get what one desires,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"It is not done to get what one desires,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"But what is it done for?\"\r\n\r\n\"For love of the Father in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do not know the Father in heaven. What is He?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the Source and the Goal of the being of your friend. He is the\r\nOne that your friend will re-become some day, if he can forever say to\r\nHim, Thy will be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"The One he will re-become?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for when he blends his will with that of the Father in heaven, the\r\nFather in heaven dwells in his heart and the two become one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then is the Father in heaven really the Self of my friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"The greatest philosopher could not have expressed it more truly,\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Then indeed do I love the Father in heaven,\" breathed the sylph, \"and I\r\nwill say now every day and all day, 'Thy will be done' to Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if it separates you from your friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can it separate me from my friend, if the Father is the Self of\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would that all angels were your equal in learning,\" I said.\r\n\r\nBut Meriline had turned from me in utter forgetfulness, and was saying\r\nover and over, with joy in her uplifted face, \"Thy will be done! Thy\r\nwill be done!\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" I said to myself, as I passed along the line, \"he who worships\r\nthe Father as the Self of the beloved has already acquired a soul.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GHOST[6]\r\n\r\nBY LAFCADIO HEARN\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: From _Karma_ (Boni & Liveright).]\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nPerhaps the man who never wanders away from the place of his birth may\r\npass all his life without knowing ghosts; but the nomad is more than\r\nlikely to make their acquaintance. I refer to the civilized nomad, whose\r\nwanderings are not prompted by hope of gain, nor determined by pleasure,\r\nbut simply compelled by certain necessities of his being--the man whose\r\ninner secret nature is totally at variance with the stable conditions of\r\na society to which he belongs only by accident. However intellectually\r\ntrained, he must always remain the slave of singular impulses which have\r\nno rational source, and which will often amaze him no less by their\r\nmastering power than by their continuous savage opposition to his every\r\nmaterial interest. These may, perhaps, be traced back to some ancestral\r\nhabit--be explained by self-evident hereditary tendencies. Or perhaps\r\nthey may not,--in which event the victim can only surmise himself the\r\n_Imago_ of some pre-existent larval aspiration--the full development of\r\ndesires long dormant in a chain of more limited lives.\r\n\r\nAssuredly the nomadic impulses differ in every member of the class, take\r\ninfinite variety from individual sensitiveness to environment--the line\r\nof least resistance for one being that of greatest resistance for\r\nanother; no two courses of true nomadism can ever be wholly the same.\r\nDiversified of necessity both impulse and direction, even as human\r\nnature is diversified! Never since consciousness of time began were two\r\nbeings born who possessed exactly the same quality of voice, the same\r\nprecise degree of nervous impressibility, or, in brief, the same\r\ncombination of those viewless force-storing molecules which shape and\r\npoise themselves in sentient substance. Vain, therefore, all striving to\r\nparticularize the curious psychology of such existences; at the very\r\nutmost it is possible only to describe such impulses and preceptions of\r\nnomadism as lie within the very small range of one's own observation.\r\nAnd whatever in these is strictly personal can have little interest or\r\nvalue except in so far as it holds something in common with the great\r\ngeneral experience of restless lives. To such experience may belong, I\r\nthink, one ultimate result of all those irrational partings,\r\nself-wrecking, sudden isolations, abrupt severances from all attachment,\r\nwhich form the history of the nomad--the knowledge that a strong silence\r\nis ever deepening and expanding about one's life, and that in that\r\nsilence there are ghosts.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOh! the first vague charm, the first sunny illusion of some fair\r\ncity, when vistas of unknown streets all seem leading to the\r\nrealization of a hope you dare not even whisper; when even the shadows\r\nlook beautiful, and strange facades appear to smile good omen through\r\nlight of gold! And those first winning relations with men, while you are\r\nstill a stranger, and only the better and the brighter side of their\r\nnature is turned to you! All is yet a delightful, luminous\r\nindefiniteness--sensation of streets and of men--like some beautifully\r\ntinted photograph slightly out of focus.\r\n\r\nThen the slow solid sharpening of details all about you, thrusting\r\nthrough illusion and dispelling it, growing keener and harder day by day\r\nthrough long dull seasons; while your feet learn to remember all\r\nasperities of pavements, and your eyes all physiognomy of buildings and\r\nof persons--failures of masonry, furrowed lines of pain. Thereafter only\r\nthe aching of monotony intolerable, and the hatred of sameness grown\r\ndismal, and dread of the merciless, inevitable, daily and hourly\r\nrepetition of things; while those impulses of unrest, which are Nature's\r\nurgings through that ancestral experience which lives in each one of\r\nus--outcries of sea and peak and sky to man--ever make wilder appeal.\r\nStrong friendships may have been formed; but there finally comes a day\r\nwhen even these can give no consolation for the pain of monotony, and\r\nyou feel that in order to live you must decide, regardless of result, to\r\nshake forever from your feet the familiar dust of that place.\r\n\r\nAnd, nevertheless, in the hour of departure you feel a pang. As train or\r\nsteamer bears you away from the city and its myriad associations, the\r\nold illusive impression will quiver back about you for a moment--not as\r\nif to mock the expectation of the past, but softly, touchingly, as if\r\npleading to you to stay; and such a sadness, such a tenderness may come\r\nto you, as one knows after reconciliation with a friend misapprehended\r\nand unjustly judged. But you will never more see those streets--except\r\nin dreams.\r\n\r\nThrough sleep only they will open again before you, steeped in the\r\nillusive vagueness of the first long-past day, peopled only by friends\r\noutstretching to you. Soundlessly you will tread those shadowy pavements\r\nmany times, to knock in thought, perhaps, at doors which the dead will\r\nopen to you. But with the passing of years all becomes dim--so dim that\r\neven asleep you know 'tis only a ghost-city, with streets going to\r\nnowhere. And finally whatever is left of it becomes confused and blended\r\nwith cloudy memories of other cities--one endless bewilderment of filmy\r\narchitecture in which nothing is distinctly recognizable, though the\r\nwhole gives the sensation of having been seen before, ever so long ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the course of wanderings more or less aimless, there has\r\nslowly grown upon you a suspicion of being haunted--so frequently does a\r\ncertain hazy presence intrude itself upon the visual memory. This,\r\nhowever, appears to gain rather than to lose in definiteness; with each\r\nreturn its visibility seems to increase. And the suspicion that you may\r\nbe haunted gradually develops into a certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nYou are haunted--whether your way lie through the brown gloom of London\r\nwinter, or the azure splendor of an equatorial day--whether your steps\r\nbe tracked in snows, or in the burning black sand of a tropic\r\nbeach--whether you rest beneath the swart shade of Northern pines, or\r\nunder spidery umbrages of palm--you are haunted ever and everywhere by a\r\ncertain gentle presence. There is nothing fearsome in this haunting--the\r\ngentlest face, the kindliest voice--oddly familiar and distinct, though\r\nfeeble as the hum of a bee.\r\n\r\nBut it tantalizes--this haunting--like those sudden surprises of\r\nsensation _within_ us, though seemingly not _of_ us, which some dreamers\r\nhave sought to interpret as inherited remembrances, recollections of\r\npreexistence. Vainly you ask yourself, \"Whose voice? Whose face?\" It is\r\nneither young nor old, the Face; it has a vapory indefinableness that\r\nleaves it a riddle; its diaphaneity reveals no particular tint; perhaps\r\nyou may not even be quite sure whether it has a beard. But its\r\nexpression is always gracious, passionless, smiling--like the smiling of\r\nunknown friends in dreams, with infinite indulgence for any folly, even\r\na dream-folly. Except in that you cannot permanently banish it, the\r\npresence offers no positive resistance to your will; it accepts each\r\ncaprice with obedience; it meets your every whim with angelic patience.\r\nIt is never critical, never makes plaint even by a look, never proves\r\nirksome; yet you cannot ignore it, because of a certain queer power it\r\npossesses to make something stir and quiver in your heart--like an old\r\nvague sweet regret--something buried alive which will not die. And so\r\noften does this happen that desire to solve the riddle becomes a pain;\r\nthat you finally find yourself making supplication to the Presence;\r\naddressing to it questions which it will never answer directly, but\r\nonly by a smile or by words having no relation to the asking--words\r\nenigmatic, which make mysterious agitation in old forsaken fields of\r\nmemory, even as a wind betimes, over wide wastes of marsh, sets all the\r\ngrasses whispering about nothing. But you will question on, untiringly,\r\nthrough the nights and days of years:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you? What are you? What is this weird relation that you bear to\r\nme? All you say to me I feel that I have heard before, but where? But\r\nwhen? By what name am I to call you, since you will answer to none that\r\nI remember? Surely you do not live; yet I know the sleeping-places of\r\nall my dead, and yours I do not know! Neither are you any dream--for\r\ndreams distort and change; and you, you are ever the same. Nor are you\r\nany hallucination; for all my senses are still vivid and strong. This\r\nonly I know beyond doubt--that you are of the Past; you belong to\r\nmemory--but to the memory of what dead suns?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, some day or night, unexpectedly, there comes to you at least, with\r\na soft swift tingling shock as of fingers invisible, the knowledge that\r\nthe Face is not the memory of any one face; but a multiple image formed\r\nof the traits of many dear faces, superimposed by remembrance, and\r\ninterblended by affection into one ghostly personality--infinitely\r\nsympathetic, phantasmally beautiful--a Composite of recollections! And\r\nthe Voice is the echo of no one voice, but the echoing of many voices,\r\nmolten into a single utterance, a single impossible tone, thin through\r\nremoteness of time, but inexpressibly caressing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThou most gentle Composite!--thou nameless and exquisite Unreality,\r\nthrilled into semblance of being from out the sum of all lost\r\nsympathies!--thou Ghost of all dear vanished things, with thy vain\r\nappeal of eyes that looked for my coming, and vague faint pleading of\r\nvoices against oblivion, and thin electric touch of buried hands--must\r\nthou pass away forever with my passing, even as the Shadow that I cast,\r\nO thou Shadowing of Souls?\r\n\r\nI am not sure. For there comes to me this dream--that if aught in human\r\nlife hold power to pass, like a swerved sunray through interstellar\r\nspaces, into the infinite mystery, to send one sweet strong vibration\r\nthrough immemorial Time, might not some luminous future be peopled with\r\nsuch as thou? And in so far as that which makes for us the subtlest\r\ncharm of being can lend one choral note to the Symphony of the\r\nUnknowable Purpose--in so much might there not endure also to greet\r\nthee, another Composite One--embodying, indeed, the comeliness of many\r\nlives, yet keeping likewise some visible memory of all that may have\r\nbeen gracious in this thy friend?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYES OF THE PANTHER[7]\r\n\r\nBY AMBROSE BIERCE\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: From \"_In the Midst of Life_\" (Boni & Liveright).]\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nONE DOES NOT ALWAYS MARRY WHEN INSANE\r\n\r\nA man and a woman--nature had done the grouping--sat on a rustic seat,\r\nin the late afternoon. The man was middle-aged, slender, swarthy, with\r\nthe expression of a poet and the complexion of a pirate--a man at whom\r\none would look again. The woman was young, blonde, graceful, with\r\nsomething in her figure and movements suggesting the word \"lithe.\" She\r\nwas habited in a gray gown with odd brown markings in the texture. She\r\nmay have been beautiful; one could not readily say, for her eyes denied\r\nattention to all else. They were gray-green, long and narrow, with an\r\nexpression defying analysis. One could only know that they were\r\ndisquieting. Cleopatra may have had such eyes.\r\n\r\nThe man and the woman talked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the woman, \"I love you, God knows! But marry you, no. I\r\ncannot, will not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Irene, you have said that many times, yet always have denied me a\r\nreason. I've a right to know, to understand, to feel and prove my\r\nfortitude if I have it. Give me a reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"For loving you?\"\r\n\r\nThe woman was smiling through her tears and her pallor. That did not\r\nstir any sense of humor in the man.\r\n\r\n\"No; there is no reason for that. A reason for not marrying me. I've a\r\nright to know. I must know. I will know!\"\r\n\r\nHe had risen and was standing before her with clenched hands, on his\r\nface a frown--it might have been called a scowl. He looked as if he\r\nmight attempt to learn by strangling her. She smiled no more--merely sat\r\nlooking up into his face with a fixed, set regard that was utterly\r\nwithout emotion or sentiment. Yet it had something in it that tamed his\r\nresentment and made him shiver.\r\n\r\n\"You are determined to have my reason?\" she asked in a tone that was\r\nentirely mechanical--a tone that might have been her look made audible.\r\n\r\n\"If you please--if I'm not asking too much.\"\r\n\r\nApparently this lord of creation was yielding some part of his dominion\r\nover his co-creature.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, you shall know: I am insane.\"\r\n\r\nThe man started, then looked incredulous and was conscious that he ought\r\nto be amused. But, again, the sense of humor failed him in his need and\r\ndespite his disbelief he was profoundly disturbed by that which he did\r\nnot believe. Between our convictions and our feelings there is no good\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\"That is what the physicians would say,\" the woman continued, \"if they\r\nknew. I might myself prefer to call it a case of 'possession.' Sit down\r\nand hear what I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nThe man silently resumed his seat beside her on the rustic bench by the\r\nwayside. Over against them on the eastern side of the valley the hills\r\nwere already sunset-flushed and the stillness all about was of that\r\npeculiar quality that foretells the twilight. Something of its\r\nmysterious and significant solemnity had imparted itself to the man's\r\nmood. In the spiritual, as in the material world, are signs and presages\r\nof night. Rarely meeting her look, and whenever he did so conscious of\r\nthe indefinable dread with which, despite their feline beauty, her eyes\r\nalways affected him, Jenner Brading listened in silence to the story\r\ntold by Irene Marlowe. In deference to the reader's possible prejudice\r\nagainst the artless method of an unpracticed historian the author\r\nventures to substitute his own version for hers.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA ROOM MAY BE TOO NARROW FOR THREE, THOUGH ONE IS OUTSIDE\r\n\r\nIn a little log house containing a single room sparely and rudely\r\nfurnished, crouching on the floor against one of the walls, was a woman,\r\nclasping to her breast a child. Outside, a dense unbroken forest\r\nextended for many miles in every direction. This was at night and the\r\nroom was black dark; no human eye could have discerned the woman and the\r\nchild. Yet they were observed, narrowly, vigilantly, with never even a\r\nmomentary slackening of attention; and that is the pivotal fact upon\r\nwhich this narrative turns.\r\n\r\nCharles Marlowe was of the class, now extinct in this country, of\r\nwoodmen pioneers--men who found their most acceptable surroundings in\r\nsylvan solitudes that stretched along the eastern slope of the\r\nMississippi Valley, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. For more\r\nthan a hundred years these men pushed ever westward, generation after\r\ngeneration, with rifle and ax, reclaiming from Nature and her savage\r\nchildren here and there an isolated acreage for the plow, no sooner\r\nreclaimed than surrendered to their less venturesome but more thrifty\r\nsuccessors. At last they burst through the edge of the forest into the\r\nopen country and vanished as if they had fallen over a cliff. The\r\nwoodman pioneer is no more; the pioneer of the plains--he whose easy\r\ntask it was to subdue for occupancy two-thirds of the country in a\r\nsingle generation--is another and inferior creation. With Charles\r\nMarlowe in the wilderness, sharing the dangers, hardships and privations\r\nof that strange unprofitable life, were his wife and child, to whom, in\r\nthe manner of his class in which the domestic virtues were a religion,\r\nhe was passionately attached. The woman was still young enough to be\r\ncomely, new enough to the awful isolation of her lot to be cheerful. By\r\nwithholding the large capacity for happiness which the simple\r\nsatisfactions of the forest life could not have filled, Heaven had dealt\r\nhonorably with her. In her light household tasks, her child, her husband\r\nand her few foolish books, she found abundant provision for her needs.\r\n\r\nOne morning in midsummer Marlowe took down his rifle from the wooden\r\nhooks on the wall and signified his intention of getting game.\r\n\r\n\"We've meat enough,\" said the wife; \"please don't go out to-day. I\r\ndreamed last night, O, such a dreadful thing! I cannot recollect it, but\r\nI'm almost sure that it will come to pass if you go out.\"\r\n\r\nIt is painful to confess that Marlowe received this solemn statement\r\nwith less of gravity than was due to the mysterious nature of the\r\ncalamity foreshadowed. In truth, he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Try to remember,\" he said. \"Maybe you dreamed that Baby had lost the\r\npower of speech.\"\r\n\r\nThe conjecture was obviously suggested by the fact that Baby, clinging\r\nto the fringe of his hunting-coat with all her ten pudgy thumbs, was at\r\nthat moment uttering her sense of the situation in a series of exultant\r\ngoo-goos inspired by sight of her father's raccoon-skin cap.\r\n\r\nThe woman yielded: lacking the gift of humor she could not hold out\r\nagainst his kindly badinage. So, with a kiss for the mother and a kiss\r\nfor the child, he left the house and closed the door upon his happiness\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall he had not returned. The woman prepared supper and waited.\r\nThen she put Baby to bed and sang softly to her until she slept. By this\r\ntime the fire on the hearth, at which she had cooked supper, had burned\r\nout and the room was lighted by a single candle. This she afterward\r\nplaced in the open window as a sign and welcome to the hunter if he\r\nshould approach from that side. She had thoughtfully closed and barred\r\nthe door against such wild animals as might prefer it to an open\r\nwindow--of the habits of beasts of prey in entering a house uninvited\r\nshe was not advised, though with true female prevision she may have\r\nconsidered the possibility of their entrance by way of the chimney. As\r\nthe night wore on she became not less anxious, but more drowsy, and at\r\nlast rested her arms upon the bed by the child and her head upon the\r\narms. The candle in the window burned down to the socket, sputtered and\r\nflared a moment and went out unobserved; for the woman slept and\r\ndreamed.\r\n\r\nIn her dreams she sat beside the cradle of a second child. The first one\r\nwas dead. The father was dead. The home in the forest was lost and the\r\ndwelling in which she lived was unfamiliar. There were heavy oaken\r\ndoors, always closed, and outside the windows, fastened into the thick\r\nstone walls, were iron bars, obviously (so she thought) a provision\r\nagainst Indians. All this she noted with an infinite self-pity, but\r\nwithout surprise--an emotion unknown in dreams. The child in the cradle\r\nwas invisible under its coverlet which something impelled her to remove.\r\nShe did so, disclosing the face of a wild animal! In the shock of this\r\ndreadful revelation the dreamer awoke, trembling in the darkness of her\r\ncabin in the wood.\r\n\r\nAs a sense of her actual surroundings came slowly back to her she felt\r\nfor the child that was not a dream, and assured herself by its breathing\r\nthat all was well with it; nor could she forbear to pass a hand lightly\r\nacross its face. Then, moved by some impulse for which she probably\r\ncould not have accounted, she rose and took the sleeping babe in her\r\narms, holding it close against her breast. The head of the child's cot\r\nwas against the wall to which the woman now turned her back as she\r\nstood. Lifting her eyes she saw two bright objects starring the darkness\r\nwith a reddish-green glow. She took them to be two coals on the hearth,\r\nbut with her returning sense of direction came the disquieting\r\nconsciousness that they were not in that quarter of the room, moreover\r\nwere too high, being nearly at the level of the eyes--of her own eyes.\r\nFor these were the eyes of a panther.\r\n\r\nThe beast was at the open window directly opposite and not five paces\r\naway. Nothing but those terrible eyes was visible, but in the dreadful\r\ntumult of her feelings as the situation disclosed itself to her\r\nunderstanding she somehow knew that the animal was standing on its\r\nhinder feet, supporting itself with its paws on the window-ledge. That\r\nsignified a malign interest--not the mere gratification of an indolent\r\ncuriosity. The consciousness of the attitude was an added horror,\r\naccentuating the menace of those awful eyes, in whose steadfast fire her\r\nstrength and courage were alike consumed. Under their silent questioning\r\nshe shuddered and turned sick. Her knees failed her, and by degrees,\r\ninstinctively striving to avoid a sudden movement that might bring the\r\nbeast upon her, she sank to the floor, crouched against the wall and\r\ntried to shield the babe with her trembling body without withdrawing her\r\ngaze from the luminous orbs that were killing her. No thought of her\r\nhusband came to her in her agony--no hope nor suggestion of rescue or\r\nescape. Her capacity for thought and feeling had narrowed to the\r\ndimensions of a single emotion--fear of the animal's spring, of the\r\nimpact of its body, the buffeting of its great arms, the feel of its\r\nteeth in her throat, the mangling of her babe. Motionless now and in\r\nabsolute silence, she awaited her doom, the moments growing to hours, to\r\nyears, to ages; and still those devilish eyes maintained their watch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning to his cabin late at night with a deer on his shoulders\r\nCharles Marlowe tried the door. It did not yield. He knocked; there was\r\nno answer. He laid down his deer and went around to the window. As he\r\nturned the angle of the building he fancied he heard a sound as of\r\nstealthy footfalls and a rustling in the undergrowth of the forest, but\r\nthey were too slight for certainty, even to his practiced ear.\r\nApproaching the window, and to his surprise finding it open, he threw\r\nhis leg over the sill and entered. All was darkness and silence. He\r\ngroped his way to the fire-place, struck a match and lit a candle. Then\r\nhe looked about. Cowering on the floor against a wall was his wife,\r\nclasping his child. As he sprang toward her she rose and broke into\r\nlaughter, long, loud, and mechanical, devoid of gladness and devoid of\r\nsense--the laughter that is not out of keeping with the clanking of a\r\nchain. Hardly knowing what he did he extended his arms. She laid the\r\nbabe in them. It was dead--pressed to death in its mother's embrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF THE DEFENSE\r\n\r\nThat is what occurred during a night in a forest, but not all of it did\r\nIrene Marlowe relate to Jenner Brading; not all of it was known to her.\r\nWhen she had concluded the sun was below the horizon and the long\r\nsummer twilight had begun to deepen in the hollows of the land. For some\r\nmoments Brading was silent, expecting the narrative to be carried\r\nforward to some definite connection with the conversation introducing\r\nit; but the narrator was as silent as he, her face averted, her hands\r\nclasping and unclasping themselves as they lay in her lap, with a\r\nsingular suggestion of an activity independent of her will.\r\n\r\n\"It is a sad, a terrible story,\" said Brading at last, \"but I do not\r\nunderstand. You call Charles Marlowe father; that I know. That he is old\r\nbefore his time, broken by some great sorrow, I have seen, or thought I\r\nsaw. But, pardon me, you said that you--that you--\"\r\n\r\n\"That I am insane,\" said the girl, without a movement of head or body.\r\n\r\n\"But, Irene, you say--please, dear, do not look away from me--you say\r\nthat the child was dead, not demented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that one--I am the second. I was born three months after that\r\nnight, my mother being mercifully permitted to lay down her life in\r\ngiving me mine.\"\r\n\r\nBrading was again silent; he was a trifle dazed and could not at once\r\nthink of the right thing to say. Her face was still turned away. In his\r\nembarrassment he reached impulsively toward the hands that lay closing\r\nand unclosing in her lap, but something--he could not have said\r\nwhat--restrained him. He then remembered, vaguely, that he had never\r\naltogether cared to take her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Is it likely,\" she resumed, \"that a person born under such\r\ncircumstances is like others--is what you call sane?\"\r\n\r\nBrading did not reply; he was preoccupied with a new thought that was\r\ntaking shape in his mind--what a scientist would have called an\r\nhypothesis; a detective, a theory. It might throw an added light, albeit\r\na lurid one, upon such doubt of her sanity as her own assertion had not\r\ndispelled.\r\n\r\nThe country was still new and, outside the villages, sparsely populated.\r\nThe professional hunter was still a familiar figure, and among his\r\ntrophies were heads and pelts of the larger kinds of game. Tales\r\nvariously credible of nocturnal meetings with savage animals in lonely\r\nroads were sometimes current, passed through the customary stages of\r\ngrowth and decay, and were forgotten. A recent addition to these popular\r\napocrypha, originating, apparently, by spontaneous generation in several\r\nhouseholds, was of a panther which had frightened some of their members\r\nby looking in at windows by night. The yarn had caused its little ripple\r\nof excitement--had even attained to the distinction of a place in the\r\nlocal newspaper; but Brading had given it no attention. Its likeness to\r\nthe story to which he had just listened now impressed him as perhaps\r\nmore than accidental. Was it not possible that the one story had\r\nsuggested the other--that finding congenial conditions in a morbid mind\r\nand a fertile fancy, it had grown to the tragic tale that he had heard?\r\n\r\nBrading recalled certain circumstances of the girl's history and\r\ndisposition of which, with love's incuriosity, he had hitherto been\r\nheedless--such as her solitary life with her father, at whose house no\r\none apparently was an acceptable visitor, and her strange fear of the\r\nnight by which those who knew her best accounted for her never being\r\nseen after dark. Surely in such a mind imagination once kindled might\r\nburn with a lawless flame, penetrating and enveloping the entire\r\nstructure. That she was mad, though the conviction gave him the acutest\r\npain, he could no longer doubt; she had only mistaken an effect of her\r\nmental disorder for its cause, bringing into imaginary relation with her\r\nown personality the vagaries of the local myth-makers. With some vague\r\nintention of testing his new \"theory,\" and no very definite notion of\r\nhow to set about it he said gravely, but with hesitation:\r\n\r\n\"Irene, dear, tell me--I beg you will not take offense, but tell me--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you,\" she interrupted, speaking with a passionate\r\nearnestness that he had not known her to show, \"I have already told you\r\nthat we cannot marry; is anything else worth saying?\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could stop her she had sprung from her seat and without\r\nanother word or look was gliding away among the trees toward her\r\nfather's house. Brading had risen to detain her; he stood watching her\r\nin silence until she had vanished in the gloom. Suddenly he started as\r\nif he had been shot, his face took on an expression of amazement and\r\nalarm: in one of the black shadows into which she had disappeared he had\r\ncaught a quick, brief glimpse of shining eyes! For an instant he was\r\ndazed and irresolute; then he dashed into the wood after her, shouting,\r\n\"Irene, Irene, look out! The panther! The panther!\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had passed through the fringe of forest into open ground\r\nand saw the girl's gray skirt vanishing into her father's door. No\r\npanther was visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAN APPEAL TO THE CONSCIENCE OF GOD\r\n\r\nJenner Brading, attorney-at-law, lived in a cottage at the edge of the\r\ntown. Directly behind the dwelling was the forest. Being a bachelor, and\r\ntherefore by the Draconian moral code of the time and place denied the\r\nservices of the only species of domestic servant known thereabout, the\r\n\"hired girl,\" he boarded at the village hotel where also was his office.\r\nThe woodside cottage was merely a lodging maintained--at no great cost,\r\nto be sure--as an evidence of prosperity and respectability. It would\r\nhardly do for one to whom the local newspaper had pointed with pride as\r\n\"the foremost jurist of his time\" to be \"homeless,\" albeit he may\r\nsometimes have suspected that the words \"home\" and \"house\" were not\r\nstrictly synonymous. Indeed, his consciousness of the disparity and his\r\nwill to harmonize it were matters of logical inference, for it was\r\ngenerally reported that soon after the cottage was built its owner had\r\nmade a futile venture in the direction of marriage--had, in truth, gone\r\nso far as to be rejected by the beautiful but eccentric daughter of Old\r\nMan Marlowe, the recluse. This was publicly believed because he had told\r\nit himself and she had not--a reversal of the usual order of things\r\nwhich could hardly fail to carry conviction.\r\n\r\nBrading's bedroom was at the rear of the house, with a single window\r\nfacing the forest. One night he was awakened by a noise at that\r\nwindow--he could hardly have said what it was like. With a little thrill\r\nof the nerves he sat up in bed and laid hold of the revolver which, with\r\na forethought most commendable in one addicted to the habit of sleeping\r\non the ground floor with an open window, he had put under his pillow.\r\nThe room was in absolute darkness, but being unterrified he knew where\r\nto direct his eyes, and there he held them, awaiting in silence what\r\nfurther might occur. He could now dimly discern the aperture--a square\r\nof lighter black. Presently there appeared at its lower edge two\r\ngleaming eyes that burned with a malignant luster inexpressibly\r\nterrible! Brading's heart gave a great jump, then seemed to stand still.\r\nA chill passed along his spine and through his hair; he felt the blood\r\nforsake his cheeks. He could not have cried out--not to save his life;\r\nbut being a man of courage he would not, to save his life, have done so\r\nif he had been able. Some trepidation his coward body might feel, but\r\nhis spirit was of sterner stuff. Slowly the shining eyes rose with a\r\nsteady motion that seemed an approach, and slowly rose Brading's right\r\nhand, holding the pistol. He fired!\r\n\r\nBlinded by the flash and stunned by the report, Brading nevertheless\r\nheard, or fancied that he heard, the wild high scream of the panther, so\r\nhuman in sound, so devilish in suggestion. Leaping from the bed he\r\nhastily clothed himself and pistol in hand, sprang from the door,\r\nmeeting two or three men who came running up from the road. A brief\r\nexplanation was followed by a cautious search of the house. The grass\r\nwas wet with dew; beneath the window it had been trodden and partly\r\nleveled for a wide space, from which a devious trail, visible in the\r\nlight of a lantern, led away into the bushes. One of the men stumbled\r\nand fell upon his hands, which as he rose and rubbed them together were\r\nslippery. On examination they were seen to be red with blood.\r\n\r\nAn encounter, unarmed, with a wounded panther was not agreeable to their\r\ntaste; all but Brading turned back. He, with lantern and pistol, pushed\r\ncourageously forward into the wood. Passing through a difficult\r\nundergrowth he came into a small opening, and there his courage had its\r\nreward, for there he found the body of his victim. But it was no\r\npanther. What it was is told, even to this day, upon a weather-worn\r\nheadstone in the village churchyard, and for many years was attested\r\ndaily at the graveside by the bent figure and sorrow-seamed face of Old\r\nMan Marlowe, to whose soul, and to the soul of his strange, unhappy\r\nchild, peace--peace and reparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHING INVISIBLE BEINGS\r\n\r\nBY WM. T. STEAD\r\n\r\n    \"Millions of Spiritual creatures walk the earth\r\n    Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.\"\r\n\r\n    --MILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during the South African War that my father obtained one of his\r\nbest authenticated spirit photographs, so I think that it is well to\r\ngive here his own account of his experiments in that direction. He\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n\"While recording the results at which I have arrived, I wish to\r\nrepudiate any desire to dogmatize as to their significance or their\r\norigin. I merely record the facts, and although I may indicate\r\nconclusions and inferences which I have drawn from them, I attach no\r\nimportance to anything but the facts themselves.\r\n\r\n\"There is living in London at the present moment an old man of\r\nseventy-one years of age, a man of no education; he can write, but he\r\ncannot spell, and he has for many years earned his living as a\r\nphotographer. He was always in a small way of business, a quiet,\r\ninoffensive man who brought up his family respectably, and lived in\r\npeace with his neighbors, attracting no particular remark....\r\n\r\n\"When he started in business as a photographer it was in the days when\r\nthe wet process was almost universal, and he was much annoyed by finding\r\nthat when he exposed plates other forms than that of the sitter would\r\nappear in the background. So many plates were spoiled by these unwelcome\r\nintruders that his partner became very angry, and insisted that the\r\nplates had not been washed before they were used. He protested this was\r\nnot so, and asked his partner to bring a packet of completely new plates\r\nwith which he would take a photograph and see what was the result. His\r\npartner accepted the challenge, and produced a plate which had never\r\npreviously been used; but when the portrait of the next sitter was\r\ntaken, there appeared a shadow form in the background. Angry and\r\nfrightened at this unwelcome appearance he flung the plate to the ground\r\nwith an oath, and from that time for very many years he was never again\r\ntroubled by an occurrence of similar phenomena.\r\n\r\n\"About ten years ago he became interested in spiritualism, and to his\r\nsurprise, and also to his regret, the shadow figures began to re-appear\r\non the background of the photographs. He repeatedly had to destroy\r\nnegatives and ask his customer to give him another sitting. It did his\r\nbusiness harm, and in order to avoid this annoyance he left most of the\r\nphotographing to his son.\r\n\r\n\"I happened to hear of these curious experiences of his and sought him\r\nout. I found him very reluctant to speak about the matter. He said\r\nfrankly he did not know how the figures came; it had been a great\r\nannoyance to him, and it gave his shop a bad name. He did not wish\r\nanything to be said about the matter. In deference, however, to repeated\r\npressing on my part, he consented to make experiments with me, and I\r\nhad at various times a considerable number of sittings.\r\n\r\n\"At first I brought my own plates (half plate size). He allowed me to\r\nplace them in his slide in the dark room, to put them in the camera,\r\nwhich I was allowed to turn inside-out, and after they were exposed I\r\nwas permitted to go into the dark room and develop them in his presence.\r\nUnder these conditions I repeatedly obtained pictures of persons who\r\nwere certainly not visible to me in the studio. I was allowed to do\r\nalmost anything that I pleased, to alter the background, to change the\r\nposition of the camera, to sit at any angle that I chose--in short to\r\nact as if the studio and all belonging to it was my own. And I\r\nrepeatedly obtained what the old photographer called 'shadow pictures,'\r\nbut none of them bore any resemblance to any person whom I had known.\r\n\r\n\"In all these earlier experiments the photographer, whom I will call Mr.\r\nB----, made no charge, and the only request that he made was that I\r\nshould not publish his name, or do anything to let his neighbors know of\r\nthe curious shadow pictures which were obtainable in his studio.\r\n\r\n\"After a time I was so thoroughly satisfied that the shadow photographs,\r\nor spirit forms, were not produced by any fraud on the part of the\r\nphotographer, that I did not trouble to bring my own marked plates--I\r\nallowed him to use his own, and to do all the work of loading the slide\r\nand of developing the plate without my assistance or supervision. What I\r\nwanted was to see whether it would be possible for me to obtain a\r\nphotograph of any person known to me in life who has passed over to the\r\nother side. The production of one such picture, if the person was\r\nunknown to the photographer, and he had no means of obtaining the\r\nphotograph of the original while on earth, seemed to me so much better a\r\ntest of the genuineness of the phenomena than could be secured by any\r\namount of personal supervision of the process of photography, that I\r\nleft him to operate without interference. The results he obtained when\r\nleft to himself were precisely the same as those when the slides passed\r\nonly through my own hands. But, although I obtained a great variety of\r\nportraits of unknown persons, I got none whom I could recognize.\r\n\r\n\"In a conversation with Mr. B-- as to how these shadow pictures, as he\r\ncalled them, came on the plate, I found him almost as much at sea as\r\nmyself. He said that he did not know how they came, but that he had\r\nnoticed that they came more frequently and with greater distinctness at\r\nsome times than at others. He could never say beforehand whether they\r\nwould come or not. He frequently informed me when my sitting began that\r\nhe could guarantee nothing. And often the set of plates would bear no\r\ntrace of any portrait save mine.\r\n\r\n\"He was very reluctant to continue the experiments, and used to complain\r\nthat after exposing four plates with a view to obtaining such pictures\r\nhe felt quite exhausted. And sometimes he complained that his 'innards\r\nseemed to be turned upside-down,' to use his own phrase. I usually sat\r\nwith him between two and three in the afternoon, and on the days which I\r\ncame he always abstained from the usual glass of beer which he took with\r\nhis midday meal. If I came unexpectedly, and he had had a single glass\r\nof beer, which formed his usual beverage, he would always assure me\r\nthat I need not expect any good results. I, however, never found any\r\nparticular difference in the results.\r\n\r\n\"We often discussed the matter together. And he was evidently working\r\nout a theory of his own, as any one might under such circumstances. He\r\nknew that when he was excited or irritated he got bad results. Hence he\r\noften used to keep a music-box going, for the music, in his opinion,\r\ntended to set up good and tranquil conditions. He said he thought\r\nsomething must come out of him--what, he did not know, but something was\r\ntaken out of him, and with this something he thought the entities,\r\nwhoever they were, built themselves up and acquired sufficient substance\r\nto reflect the rays of light so as to impress the sensitive plate in his\r\ncamera. He also thought that his old camera had become what he called\r\nmagnetized, and although it was an old-fashioned piece of furniture,\r\nwhich I not only examined myself, but have had examined by expert\r\nphotographers, nothing could be discovered within or without it which\r\nwould account for the results obtained. He also was of the opinion that\r\neven although he did not touch the photographic plate, it was necessary\r\nfor him to touch or to hold his hand over the photographic slide, and\r\nalso to hold his hand over the plate when it was in the developing bath.\r\nHis theory was that in some way or other this process magnetized the\r\nplate and brought out a shadow portrait.\r\n\r\n\"One peculiarity of almost all the shadow pictures obtained in all these\r\nseries of experiments is that they have around them the same kind of\r\nwhite drapery which is so familiar to those who have taken part in a\r\nmaterializing seance. Sometimes this drapery is more voluminous than at\r\nothers; often, when the conditions are good, the form which at first\r\nappears with its head encompassed with drapery will appear on the second\r\nplate without any drapery. On asking Mr. B-- what explanation he could\r\ngive for this, he said he did not know, but he believed that the bodily\r\nappearance assumed by the spirit was very sensitive and needed to be\r\nshielded from currents, which might harm it. But when harmony prevailed\r\nthey could venture to remove the drapery, and be photographed without\r\nit. Whatever may be the value of Mr. B--'s theory, there is little doubt\r\nthat something is given off from his body which can be photographed. The\r\nwhite mist that appears to emanate from him forms into cloudy folds out\r\nof which there protrudes a more or less clearly defined face with human\r\nfeatures. Sometimes this white and misty cloud obscures the sitter, at\r\nother times it seems to be condensed as if it were in the process of\r\nbeing worked up into a definite form for the completion of which either\r\ntime or some other conditions were lacking. It was also noticeable that\r\nthe entity--whoever it may be--which builds up the form, who is giving\r\noff sufficient solidity to impress its image upon the plate in the\r\ncamera, having once created a form, will use it repeatedly without any\r\nchange of position or expression. This will no doubt seem a great\r\nstumbling-block to many. But the fact is as I have stated it, and our\r\nfirst business is to ascertain facts, whether they tell for or against\r\nany particular hypothesis. It may be that the disembodied spirit, in\r\norder to establish its identity, constructs, out of the 'aura' given off\r\nby the photographer or other medium, a mask or cast bearing the\r\nunmistakable resemblance to the body which it wore in its sojourn on\r\nearth. Having once built it up for use in the studio, it may be easier\r\nto employ the same cast again and again instead of building up a new one\r\nat each fresh sitting. Upon this point, however, I shall have something\r\nto say further on.\r\n\r\n\"I was very much interested in the results I obtained, although as none\r\nof the photographs were identified I did not deem the experiment\r\ncompletely successful. I was very anxious to induce Mr. B-- to devote\r\nsome months to an uninterrupted series of experiments, and asked him on\r\nwhat terms I could secure his services. But he absolutely refused; he\r\nsaid he did not like it, it made him unwell, made people speak ill of\r\nhim, and it did not matter what terms were offered, he would not\r\nconsent. He was an old man, he said, and he could not find out how these\r\nthings came; and, in short, neither scientific curiosity nor financial\r\nconsideration would induce him to consent to more than an occasional\r\nsitting. I therefore dropped the matter, and for some years I\r\ndiscontinued my experiments.\r\n\r\n\"I had a friend who often accompanied me to Mr. B--'s studio, where she\r\nhad been photographed both with and without shadow pictures appearing on\r\nthe background. We often promised each other that if either of us passed\r\nover we would come back and be photographed by Mr. B-- if possible, in\r\norder to prove the reality of spirit return. Shortly after this my\r\nfriend died. But it was not until nearly four years after her death, at\r\nthe request of a friend who was very anxious to know whether she could\r\ncommunicate with those on the other side, that I went back to Mr. B--'s\r\nstudio.\r\n\r\n\"He had always been slightly clairvoyant and clairaudient. He told me\r\nthat a few days before I had written asking for the appointment, my\r\ndeceased friend had appeared in the studio and told him that I was\r\ncoming. This reminded me of her promise, and I said at once that I hoped\r\nhe would be able to photograph her. He said he didn't know; he was\r\nrather frightened of her, for reasons into which I need not enter, but\r\nif she came he would see what he could do. My friend and I sat together.\r\nThe first plate was exposed, nothing appeared in the background. When\r\nthe second plate was placed in the camera Mr. B-- nodded with a quick\r\nlook of recognition. We saw nothing. After he had exposed the second\r\nplate and before he developed it he asked us to change seats. We did\r\nthis, and as he was exposing the third plate he said, 'I am told to ask\r\nyou to do this,' and then when he closed the shutter he said, 'it is\r\nMrs. M--.' On the fourth plate there appeared a picture of a woman whom\r\nI had never seen before, and whom my friend had never seen, neither had\r\nMr. B--. When the plates came to be developed I found the second and\r\nthird plates contained unmistakable likenesses of my friend Mrs. M--.\r\nThese portraits were immediately recognized by my friend as unmistakable\r\nlikenesses of the deceased Mrs. M--. It will be objected that she had\r\nfrequently been photographed by the same photographer, and that he had\r\nsimply faked a photograph from one of his old negatives. I don't believe\r\nthat this is possible, for these portraits, although recognized\r\nimmediately by every one who knew her, including her nearest relative,\r\nare quite different from any photograph she ever had taken in life. She\r\ncertainly never was photographed enveloped in white drapery, nor do I\r\nbelieve that Mr. B-- had any negative of any of her portraits in his\r\npossession. But I fully admit that from the point of view of one who\r\nwishes to exclude every possibility of error, the fact that Mrs. M-- had\r\nbeen frequently photographed in her lifetime by the same photographer\r\nrenders it impossible to regard these photographs as conclusive\r\ntestimony as to their authenticity as a photograph of a form assumed by\r\na disembodied spirit. I have mentioned that on the fourth plate there\r\nappeared a portrait of an unknown female. On my return I was showing the\r\nprint of this shadow picture to a friend when she startled me by\r\ndeclaring that the shrouded form which appeared behind me in the\r\nphotograph was a portrait of her mother who had died some months before\r\nin Dublin. I had never seen her mother, my friend did not know of her\r\nexistence, neither did the photographer, nor does he to this day. It was\r\nonly many months afterwards that I was able to obtain a photograph of my\r\nfriend's mother, but it was taken when she was a comparatively young\r\nwoman and bore no manner of resemblance to the portrait of the lady who\r\nappeared behind me. Her daughter, however, had not the slightest\r\nhesitation in asserting that it was her mother, that she had recognized\r\nher instantly, and that it was a very good portrait of her as she\r\nappeared in the later years of her life. This startled me not a little,\r\nand convinced me that I had a good prospect of attaining some definite\r\nresults as an outcome of my experiments.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. B--, encouraged by this success, was willing to continue his\r\nexperiments, and this time I insisted upon paying him for his work.\r\n\r\n\"From this time onward the occurrence of photographs that were\r\nrecognizable on the background of the photographs taken by Mr. B--\r\nbecame frequent. Sometimes the plates were marked; but not invariably.\r\nFor my part I attach comparatively no importance to the marking of\r\nplates and the close supervision of the operator. The test of the\r\ngenuineness of a photograph that is obtained when the unknown relative\r\nof an unknown sitter appears in the background of the photograph, is\r\nimmeasurably superior to precautions any expert conjurer or trick\r\nphotographer might evade. Again and again I sent friends to Mr. B--,\r\ngiving him no information as to who they were, nor telling him anything\r\nas to the identity of the persons' deceased friend or relative whose\r\nportrait they wished to secure; and time and again when the negative was\r\ndeveloped the portrait would appear in the background, or sometimes in\r\nfront of the sitter. This occurred so frequently that I am quite\r\nconvinced of the impossibility of any fraud. One time it was a French\r\neditor, who finding the portrait of his deceased wife appear on the\r\nnegative when developed, was so transported with delight that he\r\ninsisted on kissing the photographer, Mr. B--, much to the old man's\r\nembarrassment. On another occasion it was a Lancashire engineer, himself\r\na photographer, who took marked plates and all possible precautions. He\r\nobtained portraits of two of his relatives and another of an eminent\r\npersonage with whom he had been in close relations. Or again, it was a\r\nnear neighbor, who, going as a total stranger to the studio, obtained\r\nthe portrait of her deceased daughter.\r\n\r\n\"I attach no importance whatever to the appearance of portraits of\r\nwell-known personages, which might easily be copied from existing\r\npictures, but I attach immense importance to the production of the\r\nspirit photographs of unknown relatives of sitters who are unknown to\r\nthe photographer, who receives them solely as a lady or gentleman who is\r\none of my friends.\r\n\r\n\"Although, as I have said, I do not attach much importance to\r\nphotographs appearing of well-known men, I confess that I was rather\r\nimpressed by one of my most recent experiments. I received a message\r\nfrom a medium in Sheffield, who is unknown to me, saying that Cecil\r\nRhodes, who had then been dead about nine months, had spoken to her\r\nclairaudiently, and had told her to ask me to go to the photographer's,\r\nand that he would come and be photographed. The medium was a stranger to\r\nme, and I confess that I received the message with considerable\r\nskepticism. However, when she came up to town I accompanied her to the\r\nstudio. She declared that she saw Cecil Rhodes, and that he spoke to\r\nher, and that he was standing behind me when the plate was exposed. When\r\nthe plate came to be developed, although there was one well-defined\r\nfigure standing behind me and several other faces half visible in the\r\nbackground, there was no portrait of Cecil Rhodes. I was not surprised,\r\nand went away. A month afterwards I went to have another sitting with\r\nthe photographer. I chatted with him for a short time, and then he left\r\nthe room for a moment. When he came back he said to me: 'There is a\r\nround-faced well set-up man here with a short moustache and a dimple in\r\nhis chin. Do you know him?' 'No,' I said, 'I don't know any such man.'\r\n'Well, he seems to be very busy about you.' 'Well,' I said, 'if he comes\r\nupstairs, we shall see what we can get.' 'I don't know,' said he. When I\r\nwas sitting, he said, 'There he is, and I see the letter R. Is it Robert\r\nor Richard, do you think?' 'I don't know any Robert or Richard,' I said.\r\nHe took the picture. He then proceeded with the second plate, and said,\r\n'That man is still here, and I see behind him a country road. I wonder\r\nwhat that means.' He went into the dark room, and presently came out and\r\nsaid, 'I see \"road or roads.\" Do you know any one of that name?' 'Of\r\ncourse,' I said, 'Cecil Rhodes.' 'Do you mean him as died in the\r\nTransvaal lately?' said he. I said 'Yes.' 'Well,' he said, 'was he a man\r\nlike that?' 'Well, he had a moustache,' I said. And sure enough, when\r\nthe plate was developed, there was Cecil Rhodes looking fifteen years\r\nyounger than when he died.\r\n\r\n\"Some other plates were exposed. One was entirely blank, on two others\r\nthe mist was formed into a kind of clot of light, but no figure was\r\nvisible, the fifth had a portrait of an unknown man, and on the sixth,\r\nwhen it came to be developed, there was the same portrait of Cecil\r\nRhodes that had appeared on the first, but without the white drapery\r\nround the head.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it may be said that it was well known that I was connected\r\nwith Cecil Rhodes and that the photographer therefore would have no\r\ndifficulty in faking a portrait. I admit all that, and therefore I would\r\nnot have introduced this if it had stood alone, as any evidence showing\r\nthat it was a _bona fide_ photograph of an invisible being. But it does\r\nnot stand alone, and I have almost every reason to believe in the almost\r\nstupid honesty, if I may use such a phrase, of the photographer. I am\r\nnaturally much interested in these latest portraits of the African\r\nColossus. They are, at any rate, entirely new, no such portraits, to the\r\nbest of my knowledge--and I have made a collection of all I can lay my\r\nhands on--exactly resembling those portraits which I obtained at Mr.\r\nB--'s studio.\r\n\r\n\"I will conclude the account of my experiments by telling how I secured\r\na portrait under circumstances which preclude any possibility of fake or\r\nfraud. One day when I entered the studio, Mr. B-- said to me, 'There is\r\na man come with you who has been here before; he came here some days ago\r\nwhen I was by myself; he looked very wild, and he had a gun in his hand,\r\nand I did not like the look of him. I don't like guns, so I asked him to\r\ngo away, for I was frightened of the gun, and he went. But now he has\r\ncome with you, and he has not got his gun any more, so we will let him\r\nstop.' I was rather amused at the old man's story and said, 'Well, see\r\nif you can photograph him.' 'I don't know as I can,' he said, 'I never\r\nknow what I can get,'--which is quite true, for often the photographs\r\nwhich he says he sees clairvoyantly do not come out on the plate. While\r\nhe was photographing me, I said to him, 'If you can tell this man to go\r\naway, you can ask him his name.' 'Yes,' said he. 'Will you do so?' I\r\nsaid. 'Yes,' he said. After seeming to ask the question mentally, he\r\nsaid, 'He says his name is Piet Botha.' 'Piet Botha,' I said, 'I know no\r\nsuch name. There are Louis and Philip, and Chris Botha. I have never\r\nheard of Piet; still they are a numerous family and there are plenty of\r\nBothas in South Africa, and it will be interesting to ask General Botha,\r\nwhen he arrives, whether he knows of any Piet Botha.' When the negative\r\nwas developed, sure enough there appeared behind me a photograph of a\r\nstalwart bearded person, who might have been a Boer or a Russian moujik,\r\nbut who was certainly unknown to me. I had never seen a portrait of any\r\none which bore any resemblance to the photograph.\r\n\r\n\"When General Botha arrived I did not get an opportunity of asking him\r\nabout the photograph, but some time afterwards I asked Mr. Fischer, one\r\nof the delegation from the South African Republics, to look at the\r\nphotograph, and if he got an opportunity to ask General Botha if he knew\r\nof such a man as Piet Botha. Mr. Fischer said he thought he had seen the\r\nface before, but he could not be certain. He departed with the\r\nphotograph. Some days afterwards Mr. Wessels, a member of the delegation\r\nwith Mr. Fischer, came down to my office. He said, 'I want to know about\r\nthat photograph that you gave Mr. Fischer.' 'Yes,' I said, 'what about\r\nit?' 'I want to know where you got it.' I told him. He replied\r\ndisdainfully, 'I don't believe in such things; it is superstition;\r\nbesides, that man didn't know Mr. B--; he has never been in London; how\r\ncould he come there?' 'What,' I said, 'do you know him?' 'Know him!'\r\nsaid Mr. Wessels. 'He is my brother-in-law.' 'Really!' I said. 'What did\r\nthey call him?' 'Pietrus Johannes Botha, but we always called him Piet\r\nfor short.' 'Is he dead, then?' I said. 'Yes,' said Mr. Wessels, 'he was\r\nthe first Boer officer who was killed in the siege of Kimberley; but\r\nthere is a mystery about this; you didn't know him?' 'No,' I said. 'And\r\nnever heard of him?' 'No,' I said. 'But,' he said, 'I have the man's\r\nportrait in my house in South Africa, how could you get it?' 'But,' I\r\nsaid, 'I never have had it.' 'I don't understand,' he said, moodily, and\r\nso departed. I afterwards showed the photograph to another Free-State\r\nBoer who knew Piet Botha very well, and he had not the slightest\r\nhesitation in declaring that it was an unmistakable likeness of his dead\r\nfriend.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Referring to this photo elsewhere, he wrote:--\"This at\r\nleast is not a case which telepathy can explain. Nor can the hypothesis\r\nof fraud hold water. It was by the merest accident that I asked the\r\nphotographer to see if the spirit would give his name. No one in\r\nEngland, so far as I have been able to ascertain, knew that any Piet\r\nBotha ever existed.\r\n\r\n\"As if to render all explanation of fraud or contrivance still more\r\nincredible, it may be mentioned that the _Daily Graphic_ of October,\r\n1889, which announced that a Commandant Botha had been killed in the\r\nsiege of Kimberley, published a portrait alleged to be that of the dead\r\ncommandant, which not only does not bear the remotest resemblance to the\r\nPiet Botha of my photograph, but which was described as Commandant Hans\r\nBotha!\"]\r\n\r\n\"This is a plain, straightforward narrative of my experiences; they are\r\nstill going on. But if I continue them forever I don't see how I am\r\ngoing to obtain better results than those which I have already secured.\r\nAt the same time I must admit that when I have taken my own kodak to the\r\nstudio and taken a photograph immediately before Mr. B-- had exposed his\r\nplate, I got no results. The same failure occurred with another\r\nphotographer whom I took, who took his own camera and his own plates,\r\nand took a photograph immediately before and immediately after Mr. B--\r\nhad exposed his plate, and secured no result. Mr. B--'s explanation of\r\nthis is that he thinks he does in some way or other magnetize, as he\r\nterms it, the plate, and that there is some effluence from his hand\r\nwhich is as necessary for the development of the psychic figure as the\r\ndeveloping liquid is for the development of an ordinary photograph. This\r\nexplanation would no doubt be derided as, I presume, wiseacres would\r\nhave derided the first photographers when they insisted upon the\r\nnecessity of darkness whilst developing their plates. What I hold to be\r\nestablished is that in the presence of this particular individual, Mr.\r\nB--, who at present is the only person known to me who is able to\r\nproduce these photographs, it is possible to obtain under test\r\nconditions photographs that are unmistakably portraits of deceased\r\npersons; the said deceased persons being entirely unknown to him, and in\r\nsome cases equally unknown to the sitter. Neither was any portrait of\r\nsuch person accessible either to the sitter or the photographer; neither\r\nwas either the sitter or the photographer conscious of the very\r\nexistence of these persons, whose identity was subsequently recognized\r\nby their friends.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Miss Katharine Bates was present when the Piet Botha\r\nphotograph was taken under the exact conditions specified by my father.]\r\n\r\n\"I am willing to admit that no conceivable conditions in the way of\r\nmarking plates and supervising the actions or the operations of the\r\nphotographer are of the least use, in so much as an expert conjurer can\r\neasily deceive the eye of the unskilled observer. But what I do maintain\r\nis that it is impossible for the cleverest trick photographer and the\r\nablest conjurer in the world to produce a photograph, at a moment's\r\nnotice, of an unknown relative of an unknown sitter, this portrait to\r\nbe unmistakably recognizable by all survivors who knew the original in\r\nlife. This Mr. B-- has done again and again. And it seems to me that a\r\ngreat step has been made towards establishing the possibility of\r\nverifying by photography the reality of the existence of other\r\nintelligences than our own.\"\r\n\r\nThe photographer alluded to in this article is Mr. Boursnell. He died\r\nshortly after it was written, and although father experimented with\r\nothers, he never obtained such convincing and satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIN-EATER\r\n\r\nBy Fiona Macleod\r\n\r\n    SIN.\r\n\r\n    _Taste this bread, this substance: tell me\r\n    Is it bread or flesh?_\r\n\r\n    [_The Senses approach._]\r\n\r\n    THE SMELL.\r\n\r\n    _Its smell\r\n    Is the smell of bread._\r\n\r\n    SIN.\r\n\r\n    _Touch, come.

In all the bays and creeks was a continuous weary\r\nlapping of water. There was no other sound anywhere.\r\n\r\nThus was it at daybreak; it was thus at noon; thus was it now in the\r\ndarkening of the day. A confused thrusting and falling of sounds through\r\nthe silence betokened the hour of the setting. Curlews wailed in the\r\nmist; on the seething limpet-covered rocks the skuas and terns\r\nscreamed, or uttered hoarse, rasping cries. Ever and again the prolonged\r\nnote of the oyster-catcher shrilled against the air, as an echo flying\r\nblindly along a blank wall of cliff. Out of weedy places, wherein the\r\ntide sobbed with long, gurgling moans, came at intervals the barking of\r\na seal.\r\n\r\nInland, by the hamlet of Contullich, there is a reedy tarn called the\r\nLoch-a-chaoruinn.[10] By the shores of this mournful water a man moved.\r\nIt was a slow, weary walk that of the man Neil Ross. He had come from\r\nDuninch, thirty miles to the eastward, and had not rested foot, nor\r\neaten, nor had word of man or woman, since his going west an hour after\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Contullich: i.e. Ceann-nan-tulaich, \"the end of the\r\nhillocks.\" Loch a chaoruinn means the loch of the rowan-trees.]\r\n\r\nAt the bend of the loch nearest the clachan he came upon an old woman\r\ncarrying peat. To his reiterated question as to where he was, and if the\r\ntarn were Feur-Lochan above Fionnaphort that is on the strait of Iona on\r\nthe west side of the Ross of Mull, she did not at first make any answer.\r\nThe rain trickled down her withered brown face, over which the thin gray\r\nlocks hung limply. It was only in the deep-set eyes that the flame of\r\nlife still glimmered, though that dimly.\r\n\r\nThe man had used the English when first he spoke, but as though\r\nmechanically. Supposing that he had not been understood, he repeated his\r\nquestion in the Gaelic.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute's silence the old woman answered him in the native\r\ntongue, but only to put a question in return.\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking it is a long time since you have been in Iona?\"\r\n\r\nThe man stirred uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"And why is that, mother?\" he asked, in a weak voice hoarse with damp\r\nand fatigue; \"how is it you will be knowing that I have been in Iona at\r\nall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I knew your kith and kin there, Neil Ross.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not been hearing that name, mother, for many a long year. And as\r\nfor the old face o' you, it is unbeknown to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was at the naming of you, for all that. Well do I remember the day\r\nthat Silis Macallum gave you birth; and I was at the house on the croft\r\nof Ballyrona when Murtagh Ross--that was your father--laughed. It was an\r\nill laughing that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am knowing it. The curse of God on him!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis not the first, nor the last, though the grass is on his head three\r\nyears agone now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You that know who I am will be knowing that I have no kith or kin now\r\non Iona?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay; they are all under gray stone or running wave. Donald your brother,\r\nand Murtagh your next brother, and little Silis, and your mother Silis\r\nherself, and your two brothers of your father, Angus and Ian Macallum,\r\nand your father Murtagh Ross, and his lawful childless wife, Dionaid,\r\nand his sister Anna--one and all, they lie beneath the green wave or in\r\nthe brown mould. It is said there is a curse upon all who live at\r\nBallyrona. The owl builds now in the rafters, and it is the big sea-rat\r\nthat runs across the fireless hearth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is there I am going.\"\r\n\r\n\"The foolishness is on you, Neil Ross.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now it is that I am knowing who you are. It is old Sheen Macarthur I am\r\nspeaking to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tha mise ... it is I.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will be alone now, too, I am thinking, Sheen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am alone. God took my three boys at the one fishing ten years ago;\r\nand before there was moonrise in the blackness of my heart my man went.\r\nIt was after the drowning of Anndra that my croft was taken from me.\r\nThen I crossed the Sound, and shared with my widow sister Elsie McVurie\r\ntill _she_ went; and then the two cows had to go; and I had no rent, and\r\nwas old.\"\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed, the rain dribbled from the sodden bracken\r\nand dripping loneroid. Big tears rolled slowly down the deep lines on\r\nthe face of Sheen. Once there was a sob in her throat, but she put her\r\nshaking hand to it, and it was still.\r\n\r\nNeil Ross shifted from foot to foot. The ooze in that marshy place\r\nsquelched with each restless movement he made. Beyond them a plover\r\nwheeled, a blurred splatch in the mist, crying its mournful cry over and\r\nover and over.\r\n\r\nIt was a pitiful thing to hear--ah, bitter loneliness, bitter patience\r\nof poor old women. That he knew well. But he was too weary, and his\r\nheart was nigh full of its own burthen. The words could not come to his\r\nlips. But at last he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Tha mo chridhe goirt,\" he said, with tears in his voice, as he put his\r\nhand on her bent shoulder; \"my heart is sore.\"\r\n\r\nShe put up her old face against his.\r\n\r\n\"'S tha e ruidhinn mo chridhe,\" she whispered; \"it is touching my heart\r\nyou are.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that they walked on slowly through the dripping mist, each dumb\r\nand brooding deep.\r\n\r\n\"Where will you be staying this night?\" asked Sheen suddenly, when they\r\nhad traversed a wide boggy stretch of land; adding, as by an\r\nafterthought--\"Ah, it is asking you were if the tarn there were\r\nFeur-Lochan. No; it is Loch-a-chaoruinn, and the clachan that is near is\r\nContullich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yonder, to the right.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are not going there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I am going to the steading of Andrew Blair. Maybe you are for\r\nknowing it? It is called the Baile-na-Chlais-nambuidheag.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: \"The farm in the hollow of the yellow flowers.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember. But it is remembering a Blair I am. He was Adam, the\r\nson of Adam, the son of Robert. He and my father did many an ill deed\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, to the stones be it said. Sure, now, there was, even till this\r\nweary day, no man or woman who had a good word for Adam Blair.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why that ... why till this day?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not yet the third hour since he went into the silence.\"\r\n\r\nNeil Ross uttered a sound like a stifled curse. For a time he trudged\r\nwearily on.\r\n\r\n\"Then I am too late,\" he said at last, but as though speaking to\r\nhimself. \"I had hoped to see him face to face again, and curse him\r\nbetween the eyes. It was he who made Murtagh Ross break his troth to my\r\nmother, and marry that other woman, barren at that, God be praised! And\r\nthey say ill of him, do they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, it is evil that is upon him. This crime and that, God knows; and\r\nthe shadow of murder on his brow and in his eyes. Well, well, 'tis ill\r\nto be speaking of a man in corpse, and that near by. 'Tis Himself only\r\nthat knows, Neil Ross.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe ay and maybe no. But where is it that I can be sleeping this\r\nnight, Sheen Macarthur?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not be taking a stranger at the farm this night of the\r\nnights, I am thinking. There is no place else for seven miles yet, when\r\nthere is the clachan, before you will be coming to Fionnaphort. There is\r\nthe warm byre, Neil, my man; or, if you can bide by my peats, you may\r\nrest, and welcome, though there is no bed for you, and no food either\r\nsave some of the porridge that is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that will do well enough for me, Sheen; and Himself bless you for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter old Sheen Macarthur had given the wayfarer food--poor food at\r\nthat, but welcome to one nigh starved, and for the heartsome way it was\r\ngiven, and because of the thanks to God that was upon it before even\r\nspoon was lifted--she told him a lie. It was the good lie of tender\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\"Sure now, after all, Neil, my man,\" she said, \"it is sleeping at the\r\nfarm I ought to be, for Maisie Macdonald, the wise woman, will be\r\nsitting by the corpse, and there will be none to keep her company. It is\r\nthere I must be going; and if I am weary, there is a good bed for me\r\njust beyond the dead-board, which I am not minding at all. So, if it is\r\ntired you are sitting by the peats, lie down on my bed there, and have\r\nthe sleep; and God be with you.\"\r\n\r\nWith that she went, and soundlessly, for Neil Ross was already asleep,\r\nwhere he sat on an upturned claar, with his elbows on his knees, and his\r\nflame-lit face in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased; but the mist still hung over the land, though in\r\nthin veils now, and these slowly drifting seaward. Sheen stepped wearily\r\nalong the stony path that led from her bothy to the farm-house. She\r\nstood still once, the fear upon her, for she saw three or four blurred\r\nyellow gleams moving beyond her, eastward, along the dyke. She knew what\r\nthey were--the corpse-lights that on the night of death go between the\r\nbier and the place of burial. More than once she had seen them before\r\nthe last hour, and by that token had known the end to be near.\r\n\r\nGood Catholic that she was, she crossed herself, and took heart. Then\r\nmuttering\r\n\r\n    \"Crois nan naoi aingeal leam\r\n    'O mhullach mo chinn\r\n    Gu craican mo bhonn.\"\r\n\r\n    (The cross of the nine angels be about me,\r\n    From the top of my head\r\n    To the soles of my feet),\r\n\r\nshe went on her way fearlessly.\r\n\r\nWhen she came to the White House, she entered by the milk-shed that was\r\nbetween the byre and the kitchen. At the end of it was a paved place,\r\nwith washing-tubs. At one of these stood a girl that served in the\r\nhouse--an ignorant lass called Jessie McFall, out of Oban. She was\r\nignorant, indeed, not to know that to wash clothes with a newly dead\r\nbody near by was an ill thing to do. Was it not a matter for the knowing\r\nthat the corpse could hear, and might rise up in the night and clothe\r\nitself in a clean white shroud?\r\n\r\nShe was still speaking to the lassie when Maisie Macdonald, the\r\ndeid-watcher, opened the door of the room behind the kitchen to see who\r\nit was that was come. The two old women nodded silently. It was not till\r\nSheen was in the closed room, midway in which something covered with a\r\nsheet lay on a board, that any word was spoken.\r\n\r\n\"Duit sith mor, Beann Macdonald.\"\r\n\r\n\"And deep peace to you, too, Sheen; and to him that is there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och, ochone, mise 'n diugh; 'tis a dark hour this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay; it is bad. Will you have been hearing or seeing anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as for that, I am thinking I saw lights moving betwixt here and\r\nthe green place over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"The corpse-lights?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is calling them that they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _thought_ they would be out. And I have been hearing the noise of the\r\nplanks--the cracking of the boards, you know, that will be used for the\r\ncoffin to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nA long silence followed. The old women had seated themselves by the\r\ncorpse, their cloaks over their heads. The room was fireless, and was\r\nlit only by a tall wax death-candle, kept against the hour of the going.\r\n\r\nAt last Sheen began swaying slowly to and fro, crooning low the while.\r\n\"I would not be for doing that, Sheen Macarthur,\" said the deid-watcher\r\nin a low voice, but meaningly; adding, after a moment's pause, \"_The\r\nmice have all left the house_.\"\r\n\r\nSheen sat upright, a look half of terror, half of awe in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"God save the sinful soul that is hiding,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nWell she knew what Maisie meant. If the soul of the dead be a lost soul\r\nit knows its doom. The house of death is the house of sanctuary; but\r\nbefore the dawn that follows the death-night the soul must go forth,\r\nwhosoever or whatsoever wait for it in the homeless, shelterless plains\r\nof air around and beyond. If it be well with the soul, it need have no\r\nfear; if it be not ill with the soul, it may fare forth with surety; but\r\nif it be ill with the soul, ill will the going be. Thus is it that the\r\nspirit of an evil man cannot stay, and yet dare not go; and so it\r\nstrives to hide itself in secret places anywhere, in dark channels and\r\nblind walls; and the wise creatures that live near man smell the terror,\r\nand flee. Maisie repeated the saying of Sheen, then, after a silence,\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"Adam Blair will not lie in his grave for a year and a day because of\r\nthe sins that are upon him; and it is knowing that, they are here. He\r\nwill be the Watcher of the Dead for a year and a day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sure, there will be dark prints in the dawn-dew over yonder.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the old women relapsed into silence. Through the night there\r\nwas a sighing sound. It was not the sea, which was too far off to be\r\nheard save in a day of storm. The wind it was, that was dragging itself\r\nacross the sodden moors like a wounded thing, moaning and sighing.\r\n\r\nOut of sheer weariness, Sheen twice rocked forward from her stool, heavy\r\nwith sleep. At last Maisie led her over to the niche-bed opposite, and\r\nlaid her down there, and waited till the deep furrows in the face\r\nrelaxed somewhat, and the thin breath labored slow across the fallen\r\njaw.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old woman,\" she muttered, heedless of her own gray hairs and\r\ngrayer years; \"a bitter, bad thing it is to be old, old and weary. 'Tis\r\nthe sorrow, that. God keep the pain of it!\"\r\n\r\nAs for herself, she did not sleep at all that night, but sat between the\r\nliving and the dead, with her plaid shrouding her. Once, when Sheen gave\r\na low, terrified scream in her sleep, she rose, and in a loud voice\r\ncried, \"_Sheeach-ad! Away with you!_\" And with that she lifted the\r\nshroud from the dead man, and took the pennies off the eyelids, and\r\nlifted each lid; then, staring into these filmed wells, muttered an\r\nancient incantation that would compel the soul of Adam Blair to leave\r\nthe spirit of Sheen alone, and return to the cold corpse that was its\r\ncoffin till the wood was ready.\r\n\r\nThe dawn came at last. Sheen slept, and Adam Blair slept a deeper sleep,\r\nand Maisie stared out of her wan, weary eyes against the red and stormy\r\nflares of light that came into the sky.\r\n\r\nWhen, an hour after sunrise, Sheen Macarthur reached her bothy, she\r\nfound Neil Ross, heavy with slumber, upon her bed. The fire was not out,\r\nthough no flame or spark was visible; but she stooped and blew at the\r\nheart of the peats till the redness came, and once it came it grew.\r\nHaving done this, she kneeled and said a rune of the morning, and after\r\nthat a prayer, and then a prayer for the poor man Neil. She could pray\r\nno more because of the tears. She rose and put the meal and water into\r\nthe pot for the porridge to be ready against his awaking. One of the\r\nhens that was there came and pecked at her ragged skirt. \"Poor beastie,\"\r\nshe said. \"Sure, that will just be the way I am pulling at the white\r\nrobe of the Mother o' God. 'Tis a bit meal for you, cluckie, and for me\r\na healing hand upon my tears. O, och, ochone, the tears, the tears!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till the third hour after sunrise of that bleak day in that\r\nwinter of the winters, that Neil Ross stirred and arose. He ate in\r\nsilence. Once he said that he smelt the snow coming out of the north.\r\nSheen said no word at all.\r\n\r\nAfter the porridge, he took his pipe, but there was no tobacco. All that\r\nSheen had was the pipeful she kept against the gloom of the Sabbath. It\r\nwas her one solace in the long weary week. She gave him this, and held a\r\nburning peat to his mouth, and hungered over the thin, rank smoke that\r\ncurled upward.\r\n\r\nIt was within half-an-hour of noon that, after an absence, she returned.\r\n\r\n\"Not between you and me, Neil Ross,\" she began abruptly, \"but just for\r\nthe asking, and what is beyond. Is it any money you are having upon\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how will you be getting across to Iona? It is seven long miles to\r\nFionnaphort, and bitter cold at that, and you will be needing food, and\r\nthen the ferry, the ferry across the Sound, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do for a silver piece, Neil, my man?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have none to give me, Sheen Macarthur; and, if you had, it would\r\nnot be taking it I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you kiss a dead man for a crown-piece--a crown-piece of five good\r\nshillings?\"\r\n\r\nNeil Ross stared. Then he sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"It is Adam Blair you are meaning, woman! God curse him in death now\r\nthat he is no longer in life!\"\r\n\r\nThen, shaking and trembling, he sat down again, and brooded against the\r\ndull red glow of the peats.\r\n\r\nBut, when he rose, in the last quarter before noon, his face was white.\r\n\r\n\"The dead are dead, Sheen Macarthur. They can know or do nothing. I will\r\ndo it. It is willed. Yes, I am going up to the house there. And now I am\r\ngoing from here. God Himself has my thanks to you, and my blessing too.\r\nThey will come back to you. It is not forgetting you I will be.\r\nGood-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Neil, son of the woman that was my friend. A south wind to\r\nyou! Go up by the farm. In the front of the house you will see what you\r\nwill be seeing. Maisie Macdonald will be there. She will tell you what's\r\nfor the telling. There is no harm in it, sure; sure, the dead are dead.\r\nIt is praying for you I will be, Neil Ross. Peace to you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And to you, Sheen.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that the man went.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Neil Ross reached the byres of the farm in the wide hollow, he saw\r\ntwo figures standing as though awaiting him, but separate, and unseen of\r\nthe other. In front of the house was a man he knew to be Andrew Blair;\r\nbehind the milk-shed was a woman he guessed to be Maisie Macdonald.\r\n\r\nIt was the woman he came upon first.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the friend of Sheen Macarthur?\" she asked in a whisper, as she\r\nbeckoned him to the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am knowing no names or anything. And no one here will know you, I am\r\nthinking. So do the thing and begone.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no harm to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a thing often done, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the evil does not abide?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. The ... the ... person ... the person takes them away, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"_Them?_\"\r\n\r\n\"For sure, man! Them ... the sins of the corpse. He takes them away; and\r\nare you for thinking God would let the innocent suffer for the guilty?\r\nNo ... the person ... the Sin-Eater, you know ... takes them away on\r\nhimself, and one by one the air of heaven washes them away till he, the\r\nSin-Eater, is clean and whole as before.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it is a man you hate ... if it is a corpse that is the corpse of\r\none who has been a curse and a foe ... if....\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sst!_ Be still now with your foolishness. It is only an idle saying, I\r\nam thinking. Do it, and take the money and go. It will be hell enough\r\nfor Adam Blair, miser as he was, if he is for knowing that five good\r\nshillings of his money are to go to a passing tramp because of an old,\r\nancient silly tale.\"\r\n\r\nNeil Ross laughed low at that. It was for pleasure to him.\r\n\r\n\"Hush wi' ye! Andrew Blair is waiting round there. Say that I have sent\r\nyou round, as I have neither bite nor bit to give.\"\r\n\r\nTurning on his heel, Neil walked slowly round to the front of the house.\r\nA tall man was there, gaunt and brown, with hairless face and lank brown\r\nhair, but with eyes cold and gray as the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Good day to you, an' good faring. Will you be passing this way to\r\nanywhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Health to you. I am a stranger here. It is on my way to Iona I am. But\r\nI have the hunger upon me. There is not a brown bit in my pocket. I\r\nasked at the door there, near the byres. The woman told me she could\r\ngive me nothing--not a penny even, worse luck--nor, for that, a drink of\r\nwarm milk. 'Tis a sore land this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have the Gaelic of the Isles. Is it from Iona you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is from the Isles of the West I come.\"\r\n\r\n\"From Tiree ... from Coll?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the Long Island ... or from Uist ... or maybe from Benbecula?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh well, sure it is no matter to me. But may I be asking your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Macallum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know there is a death here, Macallum?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I didn't I would know it now, because of what lies yonder.\"\r\n\r\nMechanically Andrew Blair looked round. As he knew, a rough bier was\r\nthere, that was made of a dead-board laid upon three milking-stools.\r\nBeside it was a claar, a small tub to hold potatoes. On the bier was a\r\ncorpse, covered with a canvas sheeting that looked like a sail.\r\n\r\n\"He was a worthy man, my father,\" began the son of the dead man, slowly;\r\n\"but he had his faults, like all of us. I might even be saying that he\r\nhad his sins, to the Stones be it said. You will be knowing, Macallum,\r\nwhat is thought among the folk ... that a stranger, passing by, may take\r\naway the sins of the dead, and that, too, without any hurt whatever ...\r\nany hurt whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will be knowing what is done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the bread ... and the water...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a small thing to do. It is a Christian thing. I would be doing\r\nit myself, and that gladly, but the ... the ... passer-by who....\"\r\n\r\n\"It is talking of the Sin-Eater you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, for sure. The Sin-Eater as he is called--and a good Christian\r\nact it is, for all that the ministers and the priests make a frowning at\r\nit--the Sin-Eater must be a stranger. He must be a stranger, and should\r\nknow nothing of the dead man--above all, bear him no grudge.\"\r\n\r\nAt that Neil Ross's eyes lightened for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"And why that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? I have heard this, and I have heard that. If the Sin-Eater\r\nwas hating the dead man he could take the sins and fling them into the\r\nsea, and they would be changed into demons of the air that would harry\r\nthe flying soul till Judgment-Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how would that thing be done?\"\r\n\r\nThe man spoke with flashing eyes and parted lips, the breath coming\r\nswift. Andrew Blair looked at him suspiciously; and hesitated, before,\r\nin a cold voice, he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"That is all folly, I am thinking, Macallum. Maybe it is all folly, the\r\nwhole of it. But, see here, I have no time to be talking with you. If\r\nyou will take the bread and the water you shall have a good meal if you\r\nwant it, and ... and ... yes, look you, my man, I will be giving you a\r\nshilling too, for luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will have no meal in this house, Anndramhic-Adam; nor will I do this\r\nthing unless you will be giving me two silver half-crowns. That is the\r\nsum I must have, or no other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two half-crowns! Why, man, for one half-crown....\"\r\n\r\n\"Then be eating the sins o' your father yourself, Andrew Blair! It is\r\ngoing I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, man! Stop, Macallum. See here--I will be giving you what you\r\nask.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it. Is the.... Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, come this way.\"\r\n\r\nWith that the two men turned and moved slowly towards the bier.\r\n\r\nIn the doorway of the house stood a man and two women; farther in, a\r\nwoman; and at the window to the left, the serving-wench, Jessie McFall,\r\nand two men of the farm. Of those in the doorway, the man was Peter, the\r\nhalf-witted youngest brother of Andrew Blair; the taller and older woman\r\nwas Catreen, the widow of Adam, the second brother; and the thin, slight\r\nwoman, with staring eyes and drooping mouth, was Muireall, the wife of\r\nAndrew. The old woman behind these was Maisie Macdonald.\r\n\r\nAndrew Blair stooped and took a saucer out of the claar. This he put\r\nupon the covered breast of the corpse. He stooped again, and brought\r\nforth a thick square piece of new-made bread. That also he placed upon\r\nthe breast of the corpse. Then he stooped again, and with that he\r\nemptied a spoonful of salt alongside the bread.\r\n\r\n\"I must see the corpse,\" said Neil Ross simply.\r\n\r\n\"It is not needful, Macallum.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be seeing the corpse, I tell you--and for that, too, the bread\r\nand the water should be on the naked breast.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, man; it....\"\r\n\r\nBut here a voice, that of Maisie the wise woman, came upon them, saying\r\nthat the man was right, and that the eating of the sins should be done\r\nin that way and no other.\r\n\r\nWith an ill grace the son of the dead man drew back the sheeting.\r\nBeneath it, the corpse was in a clean white shirt, a death-gown long ago\r\nprepared, that covered him from his neck to his feet, and left only the\r\ndusky yellowish face exposed.\r\n\r\nWhile Andrew Blair unfastened the shirt and placed the saucer and the\r\nbread and the salt on the breast, the man beside him stood staring\r\nfixedly on the frozen features of the corpse. The new laird had to speak\r\nto him twice before he heard.\r\n\r\n\"I am ready. And you, now? What is it you are muttering over against the\r\nlips of the dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is giving him a message I am. There is no harm in that, sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep to your own folk, Macallum. You are from the West you say, and we\r\nare from the North. There can be no messages between you and a Blair of\r\nStrathmore, no messages for _you_ to be giving.\"\r\n\r\n\"He that lies here knows well the man to whom I am sending a\r\nmessage\"--and at this response Andrew Blair scowled darkly. He would\r\nfain have sent the man about his business, but he feared he might get no\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\"It is thinking I am that you are not a Macallum at all. I know all of\r\nthat name in Mull, Iona, Skye, and the near isles. What will the name of\r\nyour naming be, and of your father, and of his place?\"\r\n\r\nWhether he really wanted an answer, or whether he sought only to divert\r\nthe man from his procrastination, his question had a satisfactory\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, it's ready I am, Anndra-mhic-Adam.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, Andrew Blair stooped once more and from the claar brought a\r\nsmall jug of water. From this he filled the saucer.\r\n\r\n\"You know what to say and what to do, Macallum.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not one there who did not have a shortened breath because of\r\nthe mystery that was now before them, and the fearfulness of it. Neil\r\nRoss drew himself up, erect, stiff, with white, drawn face. All who\r\nwaited, save Andrew Blair, thought that the moving of his lips was\r\nbecause of the prayer that was slipping upon them, like the last lapsing\r\nof the ebb-tide. But Blair was watching him closely, and knew that it\r\nwas no prayer which stole out against the blank air that was around the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nSlowly Neil Ross extended his right arm. He took a pinch of the salt and\r\nput it in the saucer, then took another pinch and sprinkled it upon the\r\nbread. His hand shook for a moment as he touched the saucer. But there\r\nwas no shaking as he raised it towards his lips, or when he held it\r\nbefore him when he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"With this water that has salt in it, and has lain on thy corpse, O Adam\r\nmhic Anndra mhic Adam Mor, I drink away all the evil that is upon\r\nthee....\"\r\n\r\nThere was throbbing silence while he paused.\r\n\r\n\"... And may it be upon me and not upon thee, if with this water it\r\ncannot flow away.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon, he raised the saucer and passed it thrice round the head of\r\nthe corpse sunways; and, having done this, lifted it to his lips and\r\ndrank as much as his mouth would hold. Thereafter he poured the remnant\r\nover his left hand, and let it trickle to the ground. Then he took the\r\npiece of bread. Thrice, too, he passed it round the head of the corpse\r\nsunways.\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked at the man by his side, then at the others, who\r\nwatched him with beating hearts.\r\n\r\nWith a loud clear voice he took the sins.\r\n\r\n\"_Thoir dhomh do ciontachd, O Adam mhic Anndra mhic Adam Mor!_ Give me\r\nthy sins to take away from thee! Lo, now, as I stand here, I break this\r\nbread that has lain on thee in corpse, and I am eating it, I am, and in\r\nthat eating I take upon me the sins of thee, O man that was alive and is\r\nnow white with the stillness!\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Neil Ross broke the bread and ate of it, and took upon himself\r\nthe sins of Adam Blair that was dead. It was a bitter swallowing, that.\r\nThe remainder of the bread he crumbled in his hand, and threw it on the\r\nground, and trod upon it. Andrew Blair gave a sigh of relief. His cold\r\neyes lightened with malice.\r\n\r\n\"Be off with you, now, Macallum. We are wanting no tramps at the farm\r\nhere, and perhaps you had better not be trying to get work this side\r\nIona; for it is known as the Sin-Eater you will be, and that won't be\r\nfor the helping, I am thinking! There--there are the two half-crowns for\r\nyou ... and may they bring you no harm, you that are _Scapegoat_ now!\"\r\n\r\nThe Sin-Eater turned at that, and stared like a hill-bull. _Scapegoat!_\r\nAy, that's what he was. Sin-Eater, Scapegoat! Was he not, too, another\r\nJudas, to have sold for silver that which was not for the selling? No,\r\nno, for sure Maisie Macdonald could tell him the rune that would serve\r\nfor the easing of this burden. He would soon be quit of it.\r\n\r\nSlowly he took the money, turned it over, and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"I am going, Andrew Blair,\" he said quietly, \"I am going now. I will not\r\nsay to him that is there in the silence, A chuid do Pharas da!--nor will\r\nI say to you, Gu'n gleidheadh Dia thu,--nor will I say to this dwelling\r\nthat is the home of thee and thine, Gu'n beannaic-headh Dia an\r\ntigh!\"[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: A chuid do Pharas da! \"His share of heaven be his.\" Gu'n\r\ngleidheadh Dia thu, \"May God preserve you.\" Gu'n beannaic-headh Dia an\r\ntigh! \"God's blessing on this house.\"]\r\n\r\nHere there was a pause. All listened. Andrew Blair shifted uneasily, the\r\nfurtive eyes of him going this way and that, like a ferret in the grass.\r\n\r\n\"But, Andrew Blair, I will say this: when you fare abroad, _Droch caoidh\r\nort!_ and when you go upon the water, _Gaoth gun direadh ort_! Ay, ay,\r\nAnndra-mhic-Adam, _Dia ad aghaidh 's ad aodann ... agus bas dunach ort!\r\nDhonas 's dholas ort, agus leat-sa!_\"[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Droch caoidh ort! \"May a fatal accident happen to you\"\r\n(_lit._ \"bad moan on you\"). Gaoth gun direadh ort! \"May you drift to\r\nyour drowning\" (_lit._ \"wind without direction on you\"). Dia ad aghaidh,\r\netc., \"God against thee and in thy face ... and may a death of woe be\r\nyours.... Evil and sorrow to thee and thine!\"]\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of these words was like snow in June upon all there. They\r\nstood amazed. None spoke. No one moved.\r\n\r\nNeil Ross turned upon his heel, and, with a bright light in his eyes,\r\nwalked away from the dead and the living. He went by the byres, whence\r\nhe had come. Andrew Blair remained where he was, now glooming at the\r\ncorpse, now biting his nails and staring at the damp sods at his feet.\r\n\r\nWhen Neil reached the end of the milk-shed he saw Maisie Macdonald\r\nthere, waiting.\r\n\r\n\"These were ill sayings of yours, Neil Ross,\" she said in a low voice,\r\nso that she might not be overheard from the house.\r\n\r\n\"So, it is knowing me you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sheen Macarthur told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have good cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a true word. I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me this thing. What is the rune that is said for the throwing into\r\nthe sea of the sins of the dead? See here, Maisie Macdonald. There is no\r\nmoney of that man that I would carry a mile with me. Here it is. It is\r\nyours, if you will tell me that rune.\"\r\n\r\nMaisie took the money hesitatingly. Then, stooping, she said slowly the\r\nfew lines of the old, old rune.\r\n\r\n\"Will you be remembering that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not forgetting it I will be, Maisie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment. There is some warm milk here.\"\r\n\r\nWith that she went, and then, from within, beckoned to him to enter.\r\n\r\n\"There is no one here, Neil Ross. Drink the milk.\"\r\n\r\nHe drank; and while he did so she drew a leather pouch from some hidden\r\nplace in her dress.\r\n\r\n\"And now I have this to give you.\"\r\n\r\nShe counted out ten pennies and two farthings.\r\n\r\n\"It is all the coppers I have. You are welcome to them. Take them,\r\nfriend of my friend. They will give you the food you need, and the ferry\r\nacross the Sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do that, Maisie Macdonald, and thanks to you. It is not\r\nforgetting it I will be, nor you, good woman. And now, tell me, is it\r\nsafe that I am? He called me a 'scapegoat', he, Andrew Blair! Can evil\r\ntouch me between this and the sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must go to the place where the evil was done to you and yours--and\r\nthat, I know, is on the west side of Iona. Go, and God preserve you. But\r\nhere, too, is a sian that will be for the safety.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon, with swift mutterings she said this charm: an old, familiar\r\nSian against Sudden Harm:\r\n\r\n    \"Sian a chuir Moire air Mac ort,\r\n    Sian ro' marbhadh, sian ro' lot ort,\r\n    Sian eadar a' chlioch 's a' ghlun,\r\n    Sian nan Tri ann an aon ort,\r\n    O mhullach do chinn gu bonn do chois ort:\r\n    Sian seachd eadar a h-aon ort,\r\n    Sian seachd eadar a dha ort,\r\n    Sian seachd eadar a tri ort,\r\n    Sian seachd eadar a ceithir ort,\r\n    Sian seachd eadar a coig ort,\r\n    Sian seachd eadar a sia ort,\r\n    Sian seachd paidir nan seach paidir dol deiseil ri diugh narach ort,\r\n      ga do ghleidheadh bho bheud 's bho mhi-thapadh!\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had she finished before she heard heavy steps approaching.\r\n\r\n\"Away with you,\" she whispered, repeating in a loud, angry tone, \"Away\r\nwith you! _Seachad! Seachad!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that Neil Ross slipped from the milk-shed and crossed the yard,\r\nand was behind the byres before Andrew Blair, with sullen mien and\r\nswift, wild eyes, strode from the house.\r\n\r\nIt was with a grim smile on his face that Neil tramped down the wet\r\nheather till he reached the high road, and fared thence as through a\r\nmarsh because of the rains there had been.\r\n\r\nFor the first mile he thought of the angry mind of the dead man, bitter\r\nat paying of the silver. For the second mile he thought of the evil that\r\nhad been wrought for him and his. For the third mile he pondered over\r\nall that he had heard and done and taken upon him that day.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down upon a broken granite heap by the way, and brooded deep\r\ntill one hour went, and then another, and the third was upon him.\r\n\r\nA man driving two calves came towards him out of the west. He did not\r\nhear or see. The man stopped; spoke again. Neil gave no answer. The\r\ndrover shrugged his shoulders, hesitated, and walked slowly on, often\r\nlooking back.\r\n\r\nAn hour later a shepherd came by the way he himself had tramped. He was\r\na tall, gaunt man with a squint. The small, pale-blue eyes glittered out\r\nof a mass of red hair that almost covered his face. He stood still,\r\nopposite Neil, and leaned on his _cromak_.\r\n\r\n\"Latha math leat,\" he said at last; \"I wish you good day.\"\r\n\r\nNeil glanced at him, but did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name, for I seem to know you?\"\r\n\r\nBut Neil had already forgotten him. The shepherd took out his\r\nsnuff-mull, helped himself, and handed the mull to the lonely wayfarer.\r\nNeil mechanically helped himself.\r\n\r\n\"Am bheil thu 'dol do Fhionphort?\" tried the shepherd again: \"Are you\r\ngoing to Fionnaphort?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tha mise 'dol a dh' I-challum-chille,\" Neil answered, in a low, weary\r\nvoice, and as a man adream: \"I am on my way to Iona.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking I know now who you are. You are the man Macallum.\"\r\n\r\nNeil looked, but did not speak. His eyes dreamed against what the other\r\ncould not see or know. The shepherd called angrily to his dogs to keep\r\nthe sheep from straying; then, with a resentful air, turned to his\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n\"You are a silent man for sure, you are. I'm hoping it is not the curse\r\nupon you already.\"\r\n\r\n\"What curse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, _that_ has brought the wind against the mist! I was thinking so!\"\r\n\r\n\"What curse?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the man that was the Sin-Eater over there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man Macallum?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange it is, but three days ago I saw you in Tobermory, and heard you\r\ngive your name as Neil Ross to an Iona man that was there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sure, it is nothing to me. But they say the Sin-Eater should not be\r\na man with a hidden lump in his pack.\"[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: i.e. With a criminal secret, or an undiscovered crime.]\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the dead know, and are content. There is no shaking off any sins,\r\nthen--for that man.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe ay and maybe no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you more to be saying to me? I am obliged to you for your\r\ncompany, but it is not needing it I am, though no offense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och, man, there's no offense between you and me. Sure, there's Iona in\r\nme, too; for the father of my father married a woman that was the\r\ngranddaughter of Tomais Macdonald, who was a fisherman there. No, no; it\r\nis rather warning you I would be.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, just because of that laugh I heard about.\"\r\n\r\n\"What laugh?\"\r\n\r\n\"The laugh of Adam Blair that is dead.\"\r\n\r\nNeil Ross stared, his eyes large and wild. He leaned a little forward.\r\nNo word came from him. The look that was on his face was the question.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was this way. Sure, the telling of it is just as I heard it.\r\nAfter you ate the sins of Adam Blair, the people there brought out the\r\ncoffin. When they were putting him into it, he was as stiff as a sheep\r\ndead in the snow--and just like that, too, with his eyes wide open.\r\nWell, someone saw you trampling the heather down the slope that is in\r\nfront of the house, and said, 'It is the Sin-Eater!' With that, Andrew\r\nBlair sneered, and said--'Ay, 'tis the scapegoat he is!' Then, after a\r\nwhile, he went on, 'The Sin-Eater they call him; ay, just so; and a\r\nbitter good bargain it is, too, if all's true that's thought true!' And\r\nwith that he laughed, and then his wife that was behind him laughed,\r\nand then....\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, 'tis Himself that hears and knows if it is true! But this is the\r\nthing I was told: After that laughing there was a stillness and a dread.\r\nFor all there saw that the corpse had turned its head and was looking\r\nafter you as you went down the heather. Then, Neil Ross, if that be your\r\ntrue name, Adam Blair that was dead put up his white face against the\r\nsky, and laughed.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, Ross sprang to his feet with a gasping sob.\r\n\r\n\"It is a lie, that thing!\" he cried, shaking his fist at the shepherd.\r\n\"It is a lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no lie. And by the same token, Andrew Blair shrank back white and\r\nshaking, and his woman had the swoon upon her, and who knows but the\r\ncorpse might have come to life again had it not been for Maisie\r\nMacdonald, the deid-watcher, who clapped a handful of salt on his eyes,\r\nand tilted the coffin so that the bottom of it slid forward, and so let\r\nthe whole fall flat on the ground, with Adam Blair in it sideways, and\r\nas likely as not cursing and groaning, as his wont was, for the hurt\r\nboth to his old bones and his old ancient dignity.\"\r\n\r\nRoss glared at the man as though the madness was upon him. Fear and\r\nhorror and fierce rage swung him now this way and now that.\r\n\r\n\"What will the name of you be, shepherd?\" he stuttered huskily.\r\n\r\n\"It is Eachainn Gilleasbuig I am to ourselves; and the English of that\r\nfor those who have no Gaelic is Hector Gillespie; and I am Eachainn mac\r\nIan mac Alasdair of Strathsheean that is where Sutherland lies against\r\nRoss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take this thing--and that is, the curse of the Sin-Eater! And a\r\nbitter bad thing may it be upon you and yours.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that Neil the Sin-Eater flung his hand up into the air, and\r\nthen leaped past the shepherd, and a minute later was running through\r\nthe frightened sheep, with his head low, and a white foam on his lips,\r\nand his eyes red with blood as a seal's that has the death-wound on it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the seventh month from that day, Aulay Macneill,\r\ncoming into Balliemore of Iona from the west side of the island, said to\r\nold Ronald MacCormick, that was the father of his wife, that he had seen\r\nNeil Ross again, and that he was \"absent\"--for though he had spoken to\r\nhim, Neil would not answer, but only gloomed at him from the wet weedy\r\nrock where he sat.\r\n\r\nThe going back of the man had loosed every tongue that was in Iona.\r\nWhen, too, it was known that he was wrought in some terrible way, if not\r\nactually mad, the islanders whispered that it was because of the sins of\r\nAdam Blair. Seldom or never now did they speak of him by his name, but\r\nsimply as \"The Sin-Eater.\" The thing was not so rare as to cause this\r\nstrangeness, nor did many (and perhaps none did) think that the sins of\r\nthe dead ever might or could abide with the living who had merely done a\r\ngood Christian charitable thing. But there was a reason.\r\n\r\nNot long after Neil Ross had come again to Iona, and had settled down\r\nin the ruined roofless house on the croft of Ballyrona, just like a fox\r\nor a wild-cat, as the saying was, he was given fishing-work to do by\r\nAulay Macneill, who lived at Ard-an-teine, at the rocky north end of the\r\nmachar or plain that is on the west Atlantic coast of the island.\r\n\r\nOne moonlit night, either the seventh or the ninth after the earthing of\r\nAdam Blair at his own place in the Ross, Aulay Macneill saw Neil Ross\r\nsteal out of the shadow of Ballyrona and make for the sea. Macneill was\r\nthere by the rocks, mending a lobster-creel. He had gone there because\r\nof the sadness. Well, when he saw the Sin-Eater, he watched.\r\n\r\nNeil crept from rock to rock till he reached the last fang that churns\r\nthe sea into yeast when the tide sucks the land just opposite.\r\n\r\nThen he called out something that Aulay Macneill could not catch. With\r\nthat he springs up, and throws his arms above him.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" says Aulay when he tells the tale, \"it was like a ghost he was.\r\nThe moonshine was on his face like the curl o' a wave. White! there is\r\nno whiteness like that of the human face. It was whiter than the foam\r\nabout the skerry it was; whiter than the moon shining; whiter than ...\r\nwell, as white as the painted letters on the black boards of the\r\nfishing-cobles. There he stood, for all that the sea was about him, the\r\nslip-slop waves leapin' wild, and the tide making, too, at that. He was\r\nshaking like a sail two points off the wind. It was then that, all of a\r\nsudden, he called in a womany, screamin' voice--\r\n\r\n\"'I am throwing the sins of Adam Blair into the midst of ye, white dogs\r\no' the sea! Drown them, tear them, drag them away out into the black\r\ndeeps! Ay, ay, ay, ye dancin' wild waves, this is the third time I am\r\ndoing it, and now there is none left; no, not a sin, not a sin!\r\n\r\n    \"'O-hi O-ri, dark tide o' the sea,\r\n    I am giving the sins of a dead man to thee!\r\n    By the Stones, by the Wind, by the Fire, by the Tree,\r\n    From the dead man's sins set me free, set me free!\r\n    Adam mhic Anndra mhic Adam and me,\r\n    Set us free! Set us free!'\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sure, the Sin-Eater sang that over and over; and after the third\r\nsinging he swung his arms and screamed:\r\n\r\n    \"'And listen to me, black waters an' running tide,\r\n    That rune is the good rune told me by Maisie the wise,\r\n    And I am Neil the son of Silis Macallum\r\n    By the black-hearted evil man Murtagh Ross,\r\n    That was the friend of Adam mac Anndra, God against him!'\r\n\r\n\"And with that he scrambled and fell into the sea. But, as I am Aulay\r\nmac Luais and no other, he was up in a moment, an' swimmin' like a seal,\r\nand then over the rocks again, an' away back to that lonely roofless\r\nplace once more, laughing wild at times, an' muttering an' whispering.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this tale of Aulay Macneill's that stood between Neil Ross and\r\nthe isle-folk. There was something behind all that, they whispered one\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nSo it was always the Sin-Eater he was called at last. None sought him.\r\nThe few children who came upon him now and again fled at his approach,\r\nor at the very sight of him. Only Aulay Macneill saw him at times, and\r\nhad word of him.\r\n\r\nAfter a month had gone by, all knew that the Sin-Eater was wrought to\r\nmadness because of this awful thing: the burden of Adam Blair's sins\r\nwould not go from him! Night and day he could hear them laughing low, it\r\nwas said.\r\n\r\nBut it was the quiet madness. He went to and fro like a shadow in the\r\ngrass, and almost as soundless as that, and as voiceless. More and more\r\nthe name of him grew as a terror. There were few folk on that wild west\r\ncoast of Iona, and these few avoided him when the word ran that he had\r\nknowledge of strange things, and converse, too, with the secrets of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nOne day Aulay Macneill, in his boat, but dumb with amaze and terror for\r\nhim, saw him at high tide swimming on a long rolling wave right into the\r\nhollow of the Spouting Cave. In the memory of man, no one had done this\r\nand escaped one of three things: a snatching away into oblivion, a\r\nstrangled death, or madness. The islanders know that there swims into\r\nthe cave, at full tide, a Mar-Tarbh, a dreadful creature of the sea that\r\nsome call a kelpie; only it is not a kelpie, which is like a woman, but\r\nrather is a sea-bull, offspring of the cattle that are never seen. Ill\r\nindeed for any sheep or goat, ay, or even dog or child, if any happens\r\nto be leaning over the edge of the Spouting Cave when the Mar-tarv\r\nroars; for, of a surety, it will fall in and straightway be devoured.\r\n\r\nWith awe and trembling Aulay listened for the screaming of the doomed\r\nman. It was full tide, and the sea-beast would be there.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed, and no sign. Only the hollow booming of the sea, as\r\nit moved like a baffled blind giant round the cavern-bases; only the\r\nrush and spray of the water flung up the narrow shaft high into the\r\nwindy air above the cliff it penetrates.\r\n\r\nAt last he saw what looked like a mass of seaweed swirled out on the\r\nsurge. It was the Sin-Eater. With a leap, Aulay was at his oars. The\r\nboat swung through the sea. Just before Neil Ross was about to sink for\r\nthe second time, he caught him and dragged him into the boat.\r\n\r\nBut then, as ever after, nothing was to be got out of the Sin-Eater save\r\na single saying: Tha e lamhan fuar! Tha e lamhan fuar!--\"It has a cold,\r\ncold hand!\"\r\n\r\nThe telling of this and other tales left none free upon the island to\r\nlook upon the \"scapegoat\" save as one accursed.\r\n\r\nIt was in the third month that a new phase of his madness came upon Neil\r\nRoss.\r\n\r\nThe horror of the sea and the passion for the sea came over him at the\r\nsame happening. Oftentimes he would race along the shore, screaming wild\r\nnames to it, now hot with hate and loathing, now as the pleading of a\r\nman with the woman of his love. And strange chants to it, too, were upon\r\nhis lips. Old, old lines of forgotten runes were overheard by Aulay\r\nMacneill, and not Aulay only; lines wherein the ancient sea-name of the\r\nisland, _Ioua_, that was given to it long before it was called Iona, or\r\nany other of the nine names that are said to belong to it, occurred\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nThe flowing tide it was that wrought him thus. At the ebb he would\r\nwander across the weedy slabs or among the rocks, silent, and more like\r\na lost duinshee than a man.\r\n\r\nThen again after three months a change in his madness came. None knew\r\nwhat it was, though Aulay said that the man moaned and moaned because of\r\nthe awful burden he bore. No drowning seas for the sins that could not\r\nbe washed away, no grave for the live sins that would be quick till the\r\nday of the Judgment!\r\n\r\nFor weeks thereafter he disappeared. As to where he was, it is not for\r\nthe knowing.\r\n\r\nThen at last came that third day of the seventh month when, as I have\r\nsaid, Aulay Macneill told old Ronald MacCormick that he had seen the\r\nSin-Eater again.\r\n\r\nIt was only a half-truth that he told, though. For, after he had seen\r\nNeil Ross upon the rock, he had followed him when he rose, and wandered\r\nback to the roofless place which he haunted now as of yore. Less\r\nwretched a shelter now it was, because of the summer that was come,\r\nthough a cold, wet summer at that.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Neil Ross?\" he had asked, as he peered into the shadows\r\namong the ruins of the house.\r\n\r\n\"That's not my name,\" said the Sin-Eater; and he seemed as strange then\r\nand there, as though he were a castaway from a foreign ship.\r\n\r\n\"And what will it be, then, you that are my friend, and sure knowing me\r\nas Aulay mac Luais--Aulay Macneill that never grudges you bit or sup?\"\r\n\r\n\"_I am Judas._\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"And at that word,\" says Aulay Macneill, when he tells the tale, \"at\r\nthat word the pulse in my heart was like a bat in a shut room. But after\r\na bit I took up the talk.\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed,' I said; 'and I was not for knowing that. May I be so bold as\r\nto ask whose son, and of what place?'\r\n\r\n\"But all he said to me was, '_I am Judas_.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, I said, to comfort him, 'Sure, it's not such a bad name in\r\nitself, though I am knowing some which have a more home-like sound.' But\r\nno, it was no good.\r\n\r\n\"'I am Judas. And because I sold the Son of God for five pieces of\r\nsilver....'\r\n\r\n\"But here I interrupted him and said, 'Sure, now, Neil--I mean,\r\nJudas--it was eight times five.' Yet the simpleness of his sorrow\r\nprevailed, and I listened with the wet in my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'I am Judas. And because I sold the Son of God for five silver\r\nshillings, He laid upon me all the nameless black sins of the world. And\r\nthat is why I am bearing them till the Day of Days.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd this was the end of the Sin-Eater; for I will not tell the long\r\nstory of Aulay Macneill, that gets longer and longer every winter; but\r\nonly the unchanging close of it.\r\n\r\nI will tell it in the words of Aulay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A bitter, wild day it was, that day I saw him to see him no more. It\r\nwas late. The sea was red with the flamin' light that burned up the air\r\nbetwixt Iona and all that is west of West. I was on the shore, looking\r\nat the sea. The big green waves came in like the chariots in the Holy\r\nBook. Well, it was on the black shoulder of one of them, just short of\r\nthe ton o' foam that swept above it, that I saw a spar surgin' by.\r\n\r\n\"'What is that?' I said to myself. And the reason of my wondering was\r\nthis: I saw that a smaller spar was swung across it. And while I was\r\nwatching that thing another great billow came in with a roar, and hurled\r\nthe double spar back, and not so far from me but I might have gripped\r\nit. But who would have gripped that thing if he were for seeing what I\r\nsaw?\r\n\r\n\"It is Himself knows that what I say is a true thing.\r\n\r\n\"On that spar was Neil Ross, the Sin-Eater. Naked he was as the day he\r\nwas born. And he was lashed, too--ay, sure, he was lashed to it by ropes\r\nround and round his legs and his waist and his left arm. It was the\r\nCross he was on. I saw that thing with the fear upon me. Ah, poor\r\ndrifting wreck that he was! _Judas on the Cross!_ It was his _eric_!\r\n\r\n\"But even as I watched, shaking in my limbs, I saw that there was life\r\nin him still. The lips were moving, and his right arm was ever for\r\nswinging this way and that. 'Twas like an oar, working him off a lee\r\nshore; ay, that was what I thought.\r\n\r\n\"Then, all at once, he caught sight of me. Well he knew me, poor man,\r\nthat has his share of heaven now, I am thinking!\r\n\r\n\"He waved, and called, but the hearing could not be, because of a big\r\nsurge o' water that came tumbling down upon him. In the stroke of an oar\r\nhe was swept close by the rocks where I was standing. In that\r\nflounderin', seethin' whirlpool I saw the white face of him for a\r\nmoment, an' as he went out on the re-surge like a hauled net, I heard\r\nthese words fallin' against my ears:\r\n\r\n\"'An eirig m'anama.... In ransom for my soul!'\r\n\r\n\"And with that I saw the double-spar turn over and slide down the\r\nback-sweep of a drowning big wave. Ay, sure, it went out to the deep sea\r\nswift enough then.

As a busy man, theories have little or no attraction for me. What\r\nI demand, and what other busy men and women demand in an investigation\r\nof this kind is that there should be a reasonable possibility of getting\r\nhold of _facts_, good solid facts which can be demonstrated as such to\r\nany open-minded inquirer, otherwise it would be useless to commence such\r\nan investigation. And we have now got these facts, and can prove them on\r\npurely scientific lines.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the word materialization, so far at least as it concerns\r\nour investigation, I understand to be this: the taking on by an entity\r\nfrom a sphere outside our own, an entity representing a man, woman, or\r\nchild (or even a beast or bird), of a temporary body built up from\r\nmaterial drawn partially from the inhabitants of earth, consolidated\r\nthrough the agency of certain persons of both sexes, termed sensitives,\r\nand moulded by the entity into a semblance of the body which (it\r\nalleges) it inhabited during its existence on earth. In other words, a\r\nmaterialization is the appearance of an entity in bodily, tangible form,\r\ni.e., one which we can touch, thus differing from an astralization,\r\netherealization, or apparition, which is, of course, one which cannot be\r\ntouched, although it may be clearly visible to any one possessing only\r\nnormal sight.\r\n\r\nLet me, then, endeavor to describe to the best of my ability, and in\r\nvery simple language, how I believe these materializations to be\r\nproduced, and the conditions which I have proved to be necessary in\r\norder that the finest results may be obtained.\r\n\r\nI will deal first with the question of _the conditions_, as without\r\nconditions of some kind no materialization can be produced, any more\r\nthan a scientific experiment--such as mixing various chemicals together,\r\nin order to produce a certain result--can be carried out successfully\r\nwithout proper conditions being provided by the experimenter. What,\r\nthen, do we mean by this word \"conditions\"?\r\n\r\nTake a homely example. The baker mixes exactly the right quantities of\r\nflour, salt, and yeast with water, and then places the dough which he\r\nhas made in an oven heated to just the right temperature, and produces a\r\nloaf of bread. Why? Because the conditions were good ones. Had he\r\nomitted the flour, the yeast, or the water, or had he used an oven over\r\nor under-heated, he could not have produced an eatable loaf of bread,\r\nbecause the conditions made it impossible.\r\n\r\nThis is what is meant by the terms \"good conditions,\" \"bad conditions,\"\r\n\"breaking conditions.\"\r\n\r\nThe conditions, then, under which I have been able to prove to many\r\nhundreds of inquirers that it is possible for materialized entities to\r\nappear on earth, in solid tangible form, are these:\r\n\r\nFirst, light, of suitable wave-length, i.e. suitable color, and let me\r\nsay here, once and for all, that I have proved conclusively for myself\r\nthat _darkness is not necessary_, provided that one is experimenting\r\nwith a sensitive who has been trained to sit always in the light.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions I have witnessed materializations in daylight; and\r\nneither of Sir William Crookes's sensitives--D. D. Home or Florrie Cook\r\n(Mrs. Corner)--would ever sit in darkness, the latter--with whom I\r\ncarried out a long series of experiments--invariably stipulating that a\r\ngood light should be used during the whole time that the experiment\r\nlasted, as she was terrified at the mere thought of darkness.\r\n\r\nI find that sunlight, electric light, gas, colza oil, and paraffine are\r\nall apt to check the production of the phenomena unless filtered through\r\ncanary-yellow, orange, red linen or paper--just as they are filtered for\r\nphotographic purposes--owing to the violent action of the actinic (blue)\r\nrays which they contain (the rays from the violet end of the spectrum),\r\nwhich are said to work at about six hundred billions of vibrations per\r\nsecond. But if the light is filtered in the way that I have described,\r\nthe production of the phenomena will commence at once, the vibrations of\r\nthe interfering rays being reduced, it is said, to about four hundred\r\nbillions per second or less.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with materializations we are apt to overlook the fact that we\r\nare investigating forces or modes of energy far more delicate than\r\nelectricity, for instance. Heat, electricity, and light, as Sir William\r\nCrookes tells us, are all closely related; we know the awful power of\r\nheat and electricity, but are only too apt to forget--especially if it\r\nsuits our purpose to do so--that light too has enormous dynamic potency;\r\nits vibrations being said to travel in space at the incredible speed of\r\ntwelve million miles a minute;[15] and it is therefore only reasonable\r\nto assume that the power of these vibrations may be sufficient to\r\ninterfere seriously with the more subtle forces, such as those which we\r\nare now investigating.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: 186,900 miles a second (J. Wallace Stewart, B.Sc.).]\r\n\r\nSecondly, we require suitable heat vibrations, and I find that those\r\ngiven off in a room either warmed or chilled to sixty-three degrees are\r\nthe very best possible; anything either much above this, or more\r\nespecially, much below this, tending to weaken the results and to cheek\r\nthe phenomena.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we require suitable _musical_ vibrations, and, after carrying\r\nout a long series of experiments with musical instruments of all kinds,\r\nI find that the vibrations given off by the reed organ--termed\r\n\"harmonium\" or \"American organ\"--or by the concertina, are the most\r\nsuitable, the peculiar quality of the vibrations given off by the reeds\r\nin these instruments proving to be the most suitable ones for use during\r\nthe production of the phenomena; although on one or two occasions I have\r\nobtained good results without musical vibrations of any kind, but this\r\nis rare.\r\n\r\nFourthly, we require the presence of a specially organized man or woman,\r\ntermed _the sensitive_, one from whom it is alleged a portion of the\r\nmatter used by the entity in the building up of its temporary body can\r\nbe drawn, with but little chance of injury to their health. This point\r\nis one of vital importance, we are told, for it has been proved by means\r\nof a self-registering weighing-machine on which he was seated, and to\r\nwhich he was securely fastened with an electrical apparatus secretly\r\nhidden beneath the seat, which would at once ring a bell in an anteroom\r\nif he endeavored to rise from his seat during the experiment, that the\r\nactual loss in weight to the sensitive, when a fully materialized entity\r\nwas standing in our midst, was no less than sixty-five pounds!\r\n\r\nBefore employing any person, then, as a sensitive for these delicate,\r\nnot to say dangerous, experiments, he or she should be medically\r\nexamined, in the interests of both the investigator and the sensitive,\r\nand should their health prove to be in any way below par, they should\r\nnot be permitted to take part in the experiment until their health is\r\nfully restored.\r\n\r\nI have been permitted to examine the sensitive at the moment when an\r\nentity, clad in a fully-formed temporary body, was walking amongst the\r\nexperimenters; and the distorted features, the shrivelled-up limbs and\r\ncontorted trunk of the sensitive at that moment proclaimed the danger\r\nconnected with the production of this special form of phenomena far\r\nlouder than any words of mine could do.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, sensitives for materializations are extremely rare, not\r\nmore than two or three being found to-day amidst the teeming millions\r\nwho inhabit the British Islands; although a few are to be found on the\r\nEuropean continent, and several in North America, where the climatic\r\nconditions are said to be more favorable for the development of such\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nNow, what constitutes a sensitive, and why are they necessary?\r\n\r\nSensitives through whom physical phenomena (including materializations)\r\ncan be produced have been described, firstly, as persons in whom certain\r\nforces are stored up, either far in excess of the amount possessed by\r\nthe normal man or woman, or else differing in quality from the forces\r\nstored up by the normal man or woman; and secondly, as persons who are\r\nable to attract from those in close proximity to them--provided that the\r\nconditions are favorable--still more of the force, which thus becomes\r\ncentered in them for the time being. In other words, a sensitive for\r\nphysical phenomena is said to be a storage battery for the force which\r\nis used in the production of physical phenomena--including\r\nmaterializations--although it is by no means improbable that such highly\r\ndeveloped sensitives as those required for this special purpose may be\r\nfound to possess extra nerve-centers as compared with those possessed by\r\nnormal human beings. But whether this hypothesis be eventually proved or\r\nnot, there seems to be but very little doubt that \"whatever the force\r\nmay be which constitutes the difference between a sensitive and a\r\nnon-sensitive, it is certainly of a mental or magnetic character, i.e.,\r\na combination of the subtle elements of mind and magnetism, and\r\ntherefore of a _psychological_, and not of a purely _physical_\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nBut why is a sensitive necessary? you ask. Think of a telephone for a\r\nmoment. You wish to communicate with a person who is holding only the\r\nend of the wire in his hand, the result being that he cannot hear a\r\nsingle word. Why is this? Because he has forgotten to fit a receiver at\r\nhis end of the wire, a receiver in which the vibrations set up by your\r\nvoice may be centralized, focussed, a receiver which he can place to his\r\near, and in doing so will at once hear your voice distinctly--but\r\nwithout this your message to him is lost.\r\n\r\nAnd it is said that this is exactly the use of the sensitives during our\r\nexperiments, for they act as \"receivers\" in which the forces employed in\r\nthe production of the phenomena may be centralized, focussed, their\r\nvarying degrees of sensitiveness enabling them to be used by the\r\nentities in other spheres for the successful production of such\r\nphenomena, we are told.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, we require about twelve to sixteen earnest and really\r\nsympathetic men and women--persons trained on scientific lines for\r\nchoice--all in the best of health; men and women who, whilst strictly on\r\ntheir guard against anything in the shape of fraud, are still so much in\r\nsympathy with the person who is acting as the sensitive that they are\r\nall the time sending out kindly thoughts towards him; for if, as has\r\nbeen said, \"thoughts are things,\" it is possible that hostile thoughts\r\nwould be sufficient not only to enfeeble, but actually to check\r\ndemonstrations of physical phenomena of all kinds in the presence of\r\nsuch specially organized, highly developed individuals as the sensitives\r\nthrough whom materializations can be produced.\r\n\r\nI shall refer to these men and women as the sitters. We generally select\r\nan equal number so far as sex is concerned; and, in addition, we\r\nendeavor to obtain an equal number of persons possessing either\r\npositive or negative temperaments. In this way we form the sitters into\r\na powerful human battery, the combined force given off by them (if the\r\nbattery is properly arranged, and the individual members of that battery\r\nare in good health) proving of enormous assistance during our\r\nexperiments. If in ill-health, we find that a man or woman is useless to\r\nus, for we can no more expect to obtain the necessary power from such an\r\nindividual than we can expect to produce an electric spark from a\r\ndischarged accumulator, or pick up needles with a demagnetized piece of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nWe are told to remember always that \"all manifestations of natural laws\r\nare the results of natural conditions.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMinor details too, we find, must be thought out most carefully if we are\r\nto provide what we may term ideal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe chairs should be made of wood throughout, those known as Austrian\r\nbentwood chairs, having perforated seats, being proved to be the best\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe sitters should bathe and then change their clothing--the ladies into\r\nwhite dresses, and the men into dark suits--two hours before the time\r\nfixed for the experiment, and should then at once partake of a light\r\nmeal--meat and alcohol being strictly forbidden--so that the strain upon\r\ntheir constitutions during the experiment may not interfere with their\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nTrivial as such matters must appear to the man in the street, we are\r\ntold they must all be carried out most carefully, in order that the\r\nfinest conditions possible may be obtained, the one great object of the\r\nsitters being to give off all the power--and the best kind of\r\npower--that they are capable of producing, in order that sufficient\r\nsuitable material may be gathered together from the sensitive and\r\nthemselves, with which a temporary body may be formed for the use of any\r\nentity wishing to materialize in their presence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECAUTIONS AGAINST FRAUD\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to see what happens at a typical experimental meeting\r\nfor these materializations, at hundreds of which I have assisted, having\r\nthe services of no less than six sensitives placed at my disposal for\r\nthis purpose. I will endeavor to describe what I should consider to be\r\nan ideal one, held under ideal (test) conditions.\r\n\r\nOur imaginary test meeting is to be carried out--as it was on one\r\noccasion in London--in an entirely empty house, which none of us has\r\never entered before, a house which we will hire for this special event.\r\nBy doing this we may feel sure that all possibility of fraud, so far as\r\nthe use of secret trap-doors, large mirrors, and other undesirable\r\nthings of that description are concerned, can be successfully thwarted.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to start our experiment; the general feeling of all\r\nthose in the room being that every possible precaution against trickery\r\nhas been taken, and that if any results of any kind whatever should\r\nfollow they will undoubtedly be genuine.\r\n\r\nThe sitters having been allotted their seats, so that a person of a\r\npositive and a person of a negative temperament are seated together, we\r\nnow join hands, and form ourselves into what we are told is a powerful\r\nhuman battery; the two persons sitting at the two ends of the\r\nhalf-circle having of course each one hand free, and from the free hands\r\nof these two persons, it is said, the power developed and given off by\r\nthis human battery passes into the sensitive at each of his sides.\r\n\r\nSitting quietly in our chairs and talking gently amongst ourselves, we\r\nsoon feel a cool breeze blowing across our hands. In another two minutes\r\nthis will have so increased in volume that it may with truth be\r\ndescribed as a strong wind.\r\n\r\nOn looking at the sensitive now, we see that he is rapidly passing into\r\na state of trance--his head is drooping on one side, his arms and hands\r\nhang downwards loosely, his body being in a limp _real trance_\r\ncondition, and just in the right state for use by any entity desiring to\r\nwork through him, we are told.\r\n\r\nI have only experimented with one sensitive who did not pass into\r\ntrance, who, seated amongst the sitters, remained in a perfectly normal\r\ncondition during the whole of the experiment; watching the materialized\r\nforms building up beside him, and talking to and with them during the\r\nprocess. I shall refer to him shortly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now set our clairvoyants to work, and the statements made by one must\r\nbe confirmed in every detail by the statements of the other as to what\r\nis occurring at the moment, or no notice is taken of their remarks.\r\n\r\nBoth now report that they see a thin white mist or vapor[16] coming\r\nfrom the left side of the sensitive, if a man (or from the pelvis, if a\r\nwoman), which passes into the sitter at the end of the half-circle\r\nnearest to the sensitive's left side. It then passes, they state, from\r\nSitter No. 1 to Sitter No. 2, and so on, until it has gone through the\r\nwhole of the sixteen sitters, passing finally from the last one--No.\r\n16--at the end of the half-circle nearest to the sensitive's right side,\r\nand disappears into his right side.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Termed teleplasma.]\r\n\r\nWe assume from this that the nerve force, magnetic power--call it what\r\nyou will--necessary for the formation of one of these temporary bodies\r\nstarts from the sensitive, passes through each sitter, drawing from each\r\nas much more force or power as he or she is capable of giving off at the\r\nmoment, returning to the sensitive greatly increased in its amount and\r\nready for use in the next process. This, then, we will term the first of\r\nthe three stages in the evolution of an entity clad in a temporary body.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VAPOR STAGE\r\n\r\nIn a few moments our clairvoyants both report that the force or power is\r\nissuing from the side of the sensitive, if a man (or from the pelvis, if\r\na woman), in the form of a white, soft, dough-like substance, which on\r\none occasion I was permitted to touch. I could perceive no smell given\r\noff by it; it felt cold and clammy, and appeared to have the consistency\r\nof heavy dough at the moment that I touched it.\r\n\r\nThis mass of dough-like substance is said to be the material used by the\r\nentities--one by one as a rule--who wish to build up a temporary body.\r\nIt seems to rest on the floor, somewhere near the right side of the\r\nsensitive, until required for use: its bulk depending apparently upon\r\nthe amount of power given off by the sitters from time to time during\r\nthe experiment.\r\n\r\nThis we will term the second of the three stages of the evolution of an\r\nentity clad in a temporary body.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLID, BUT SHAPELESS STAGE\r\n\r\nWe are told that the entity wishing to show himself to us passes into\r\nthis shapeless mass of dough-like substance, which at once increases in\r\nbulk, and commences to pulsate and move up and down, swaying from side\r\nto side as it grows in height, the motive power being evidently\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\nThe entity then quickly sets to work to mould the mass into something\r\nresembling a human body, commencing with the head. The rest of the upper\r\nportion of the body soon follows, and the heart and pulse can now be\r\nfelt to be beating quite regularly and normally, differing in this\r\nrespect from those of the sensitive, who, if tested at this time, will\r\nbe found with both heart and pulse-beats considerably above the normal.\r\nThe legs and feet come last, and then the entity is able to leave the\r\nnear neighborhood of the sensitive and to walk amongst the sitters, the\r\nthird and last stage of its evolution being now complete.\r\n\r\nAlthough occasionally the entity will appear clad in an exact copy of\r\nthe clothing which he states that he wore when on earth--especially if\r\nit should happen to be something a little out of the common, such as a\r\nmilitary or naval uniform--they are draped as a rule in flowing white\r\ngarments of a wonderfully soft texture, and this, too, I have been\r\npermitted to handle.\r\n\r\nOur clairvoyants both affirm that at all times during the\r\nmaterialization a thin band of, presumably, the dough-like substance can\r\nbe plainly seen issuing from the side of the sensitive, if a man, (or\r\nfrom the pelvis, if a woman), and joined onto the center of the body\r\ninhabited by the entity--just like the umbilical cord attached to a\r\nhuman infant at birth--and we are instructed that this band cannot be\r\nstretched beyond a certain radius, say ten to fifteen feet, without\r\ndoing harm to the sensitive and to the entity; although cases are on\r\nrecord where materializations have been seen at a distance of nearly\r\nsixty feet from the sensitive, on occasions when the conditions were\r\nunusually favorable.\r\n\r\nOn handling different portions of the materialized body now, the flesh\r\nis found to be both warm and firm. The bodies are well proportioned,\r\nthose of the females--for they take on sex conditions during the\r\nprocess--having beautiful figures; the hands, arms, legs, and feet are\r\nquite perfect in their modelling, but in my opinion the body, head, and\r\nlimbs of every materialization of either sex or any age which I have\r\nscrutinized at close quarters carefully, or have been permitted to\r\nhandle, have appeared to be at least one-third smaller in size (except\r\nas regards actual height) than those possessed by beings on earth of the\r\nsame sex and age.\r\n\r\nNot only have we witnessed materializations of aged entities of both\r\nsexes, showing all the characteristics of old age--for the purpose of\r\nidentification by the sitters, as they tell us--but we have seen\r\nmaterialized infants also; and on one occasion two still-born children\r\nappeared in our midst simultaneously, one of them showing distinct\r\ntraces on its little face of a hideous deformity which it possessed at\r\nthe time of its premature birth--a deformity known only to the mother,\r\nwho happened to be present that evening as one of the sitters.\r\n\r\nWe are told that, for the purpose of identification, the entity will\r\nreturn to earth in an exact counterpart of the body which he alleges\r\nthat he occupied at the time of his death, in order that he may be\r\nrecognized by his relatives and friends who happen to be present. Thus,\r\nthe one who left the earth as an infant will appear in his materialized\r\nbody as an infant, although he may have been dead for twenty or thirty\r\nyears. The aged man or woman will appear with bent body, wrinkled face,\r\nand snow-white hair, walking amongst us with difficulty, and just as\r\nthey allege they did before their death, although that may have occurred\r\ntwenty years before. The one who had lost a limb during his earth-life\r\nwill return minus that limb; the one who was disfigured by accident or\r\ndisease will return bearing distinct traces of that disfigurement, for\r\nthe purpose of identification only.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the identification has been established successfully, all\r\nthis changes instantly; the disfigurement disappears; the four limbs\r\nwill be seen, and both the infant and the aged will from henceforth show\r\nthemselves to us in the very prime of life--the young growing upwards\r\nand the aged downwards, as we say, and, as they one and all state\r\nemphatically, just as they really look and feel in the sphere in which\r\nthey now exist.\r\n\r\nWhile inhabiting these temporary bodies, they state that they take on,\r\nnot only sex conditions, but earth conditions temporarily too; for they\r\nappear to feel pain if their bodies are injured in any way; complain of\r\nthe cold if the temperature of the room is allowed to fall much below\r\nsixty degrees, or of the heat if the temperature is allowed to rise\r\nabove seventy degrees; seem to be depressed during a thunderstorm, when\r\nour atmosphere is overcharged with electricity; and appear bright and\r\nhappy in a warm room when the world outside is in the grip of a hard\r\nfrost, and also on bright, starry nights.\r\n\r\nAnd not only this, but they take on strongly marked characteristics of\r\nthe numerous races on earth temporarily too; the materialized entities\r\nof the white races differing quite as markedly from those of the yellow\r\nor brown races, as do these from the black races; and in speaking to us\r\neach one will communicate in the particular language only which is\r\ncharacteristic of his race on earth.\r\n\r\nFive, six and even _seven_ totally different languages have been\r\nemployed during a single experimental meeting through a sensitive who\r\nhad never in his life been out of England, and who was proved\r\nconclusively to know no other language than English; the latter number,\r\nwe were told, being in honor of a ship's doctor who was present on one\r\noccasion, and who--although the fact was quite unknown to any of us at\r\nthe time--proved to be an expert linguist, for he conversed that evening\r\nwith different entities in English, French, German, Russian, Chinese,\r\nJapanese, and in the language of one of the hill-tribes of India.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when I was the only European present at an\r\nafternoon experimental meeting held in London by eight Parsees of both\r\nsexes from Bombay, during the whole of the time which the meeting\r\nlasted--two and a quarter hours--the entities and the Parsee sitters\r\ncarried on their conversation in Hindustani; two entities and one of the\r\nParsee men simultaneously engaging in a heated controversy, which lasted\r\nfor nearly three minutes, over the disposal of the bodies of their dead,\r\nthe entities insisting on cremation only, as opposed to allowing the\r\nbodies to be eaten by vultures--the noise which they made during this\r\ndiscussion being almost deafening. The sensitive, it was proved\r\nconclusively, knew no other language than English, and had only once\r\nbeen out of the British Islands, when he paid a short visit to France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     \"_Sit down before a fact as a little child: be prepared to give\r\n     up every preconceived notion: follow humbly wherever and to\r\n     whatever abysses Nature leads, or you shall learn\r\n     nothing._\"--THOMAS HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTS\r\n\r\nThe tests given to me and to my fellow-investigators through the six\r\nsensitives who so ably assisted us during our seven years of\r\nexperimental work in this little-known field of research--the tests have\r\nbeen so numerous, and were of such a varied character, that I find it\r\nsomewhat difficult to know which to select out of the hundreds which\r\nwere recorded in our books officially and elsewhere, the ones which will\r\nprove of the greatest interest to inquirers; but I have made extracts\r\nfrom ten of these records, and these, with a few taken from Sir William\r\nCrookes's reports on the experiments conducted in his presence, will, in\r\nmy opinion, be sufficient to prove that we who have witnessed these\r\nmarvels are neither hallucinated, insane, nor liars when we solemnly\r\naffirm that we have both seen and handled the materialized bodies built\r\nup for temporary use by entities from another sphere; all the statements\r\nmade here being true in every detail, to the best of my knowledge and\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT NO. 1\r\n\r\nPlace--_Lyndhurst, New Forest, Hampshire. Sensitive A, male, aged about\r\n46._\r\n\r\nAs an example of a simple but exceedingly severe test, I would first\r\nrecord one given to me and a fellow-investigator on the outskirts of the\r\nNew Forest, one for which no special preparation of any kind whatever\r\nhad been made.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive, a nearly blind man, was taken by us on a dark night to a\r\nspot totally unknown to him, as he had only just arrived from London by\r\ntrain, and was led into a large travelling caravan, one which he had\r\nnever been near before, as it had only recently left the builder's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I had made a critical examination of the interior of the\r\ncaravan, and had satisfied myself that no one was or could possibly be\r\nconcealed in it. I then locked the door, and kept the key in my pocket\r\nuntil the moment when, on the arrival of the sensitive, I unlocked the\r\ndoor and we all passed into the caravan together. I then locked and\r\nbolted the door behind us.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, no preparation of any kind had been made for the\r\nexperiment. It was merely the result of a desire to see if anything\r\ncould be produced through this sensitive, under extremely difficult\r\nconditions--conditions which we considered as so utterly bad as to make\r\nfailure a certainty.\r\n\r\nWe did not even possess a chair of any kind for the sensitive or\r\nourselves to sit upon, so we placed for his use a board on top of the\r\niron cooking-range which was fixed in the kitchen-portion of the\r\ncaravan, whilst we sat upon the two couches which were used as beds in\r\nthe living-portion of the caravan. There was no music, no powerful\r\n\"human battery\" in the shape of a number of picked sitters; in fact, the\r\nconditions were just about as bad as they could possibly be, and yet,\r\nwithin ten minutes of my locking the door behind us, the figure of a\r\ntall man stood before us, a man so tall that he was compelled to bow his\r\nhead as he passed under the six-foot high partition which separated the\r\ntwo sections of the caravan.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I am Colonel -- who was 'killed,' as you say, at the battle of\r\n-- in Egypt. For many years during my earth-life I was deeply interested\r\nin materializations, and spent the last night of my life in England\r\nexperimenting with this very sensitive; and it is a great pleasure to me\r\nto be able to return to you--strangers though you both are to\r\nme--through him. To prove to you that I am not the sensitive\r\nmasquerading before you, will you please come here and stand close to\r\nme, and so settle the matter for yourself?\"\r\n\r\nI at once rose and stood beside him, almost touching him. I then\r\ndiscovered that not only were his features and his coloring totally\r\ndifferent from those of the sensitive, but that he towered above me,\r\nstanding, as nearly as I could judge, six foot two or three inches, and\r\nwas certainly four inches taller than either the sensitive or myself.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus standing beside him, and at a distance of about eight feet\r\nfrom the sensitive, we could both hear the unfortunate man moving\r\nuneasily on his hard seat on the kitchen-range, sighing and moaning as\r\nif in pain.\r\n\r\nThe entity remained with us for about three minutes, and his place was\r\nthen taken by a slightly built young man, standing about five feet nine\r\ninches, one claiming to be a recently deceased member of the royal\r\nfamily. He talked with us in a soft and pleasing voice, finally\r\nwhispering a private message to my companion, asking him to deliver it\r\nto his mother, Queen --.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT NO. 2\r\n\r\nPlace--_Peckham Rye, London, S. E. Sensitive A, male, aged about 46._\r\n\r\nAn almost equally hopeless task was set this sensitive by the owner of\r\nthe caravan and myself when we experimented with him at midday on a\r\nbrilliant morning in July, with sunlight streaming into the room round\r\nthe edges of the drawn down window-blinds, and round the top, sides, and\r\nbottom of the heavy window-curtains, which we had pinned together in a\r\nvain attempt to keep out the sunlight during the experiment.\r\n\r\nAnd yet once again, and in spite of the conditions which we regarded as\r\nutterly hopeless, the figure of a man appeared in less than ten minutes,\r\nmaterialized from head to foot, as he proved to us by showing us his\r\nlower limbs. He left the side of the sensitive, walked out into the room\r\nand stood between us, talking to us in a deep rich voice for nearly\r\nthree minutes. As he stood beside us we could hear the sensitive, twelve\r\nfeet away, moving uneasily on his chair and groaning slightly.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after he disappeared the same (alleged) recently deceased\r\nmember of the royal family walked out to us and held a short private\r\nconversation with my companion, and sent another message to his mother,\r\nQueen --.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT NO. 3\r\n\r\nPlace--_West Hampstead, London, N. W. Sensitive B, female, aged about\r\n49._\r\n\r\nPersons of middle age or older who happened to be in England a few years\r\nago at the time that two lawsuits were brought against a celebrated\r\nconjurer by the clever young man who had succeeded in exposing one of\r\nhis most mystifying tricks, will well remember the sensation caused by\r\nthe giving of both verdicts against the conjurer; and the young man--to\r\nwhom I shall refer as Mr. X--at once became famous as the man who had\r\nbeaten one of the cleverest conjurers of the day.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, who had been present on several occasions when Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes's sensitive--Florrie Cook (Mrs. Corner), referred to\r\nabove as Sensitive B--had produced materializations in gaslight at my\r\nhouse in London, asked her to visit his house at West Hampstead one\r\nevening to meet several friends of his, and to see if it were possible\r\nfor any entity to materialize in my friend's own drawing-room.\r\n\r\nShe at once accepted his invitation to sit there under strict test\r\nconditions; and, talking the matter over with some of his friends a day\r\nor two before the one chosen for the experiment, he told me that they\r\nhad arranged to have the sensitive securely tied to her chair, to have\r\nstrong iron rings fastened to the floor-boards, through which ropes\r\nwould be passed, these ropes to be securely fastened to the sensitive's\r\nlegs; all knots of every size and kind to be sealed, so as to prevent\r\nany attempt on her part to leave her chair and to masquerade as a\r\nmaterialized entity.\r\n\r\nOne of his friends happened to know the celebrated Mr. X--, and, as he\r\nhad so recently succeeded in beating so notable a conjurer, he was\r\ninvited to be present and to take entire charge of the tying up, the\r\nbinding and sealing arrangements, in order to render the escape of the\r\nsensitive from her chair an impossibility.\r\n\r\nWhen I joined the party in the drawing-room, Mr. X--, to whom I was\r\nintroduced, was busily engaged in tying the sensitive up with his own\r\nropes and tapes, sealing every knot with special sealing-wax and with a\r\nseal provided by our host. The room was a large one, and a portion at\r\none end had been cleared of all furniture, and in the center of this\r\nspace only the sensitive seated upon her chair, and Mr. X-- busily at\r\nwork, were to be seen; and the latter, after another fifteen minutes of\r\nreal hard labor, was asked by our host if he was thoroughly satisfied\r\nthat the sensitive was fastened to her chair securely. He replied that\r\nso securely was she fastened, that if she could produce phenomena of any\r\nkind whatever under such conditions, he would at once admit their\r\ngenuineness.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive was all this time in a perfectly normal state, and not\r\nflurried in any way, her one anxiety being lest we should lower the\r\nlights, as she was so terrified at the thought of darkness.\r\n\r\nMr. X--, after stepping backwards to have a final look at the result of\r\nhis labors, then walked close to the spot where the sensitive was\r\nsitting in gaslight, and put one hand up towards the top of the curtain,\r\nand was in the act of drawing this round her to keep the direct rays of\r\nthe gaslight from falling upon her, when a large brown arm and hand\r\nsuddenly appeared, the hand being clapped heavily upon Mr. X--'s\r\nshoulder, whilst a gruff masculine voice asked him in loud tones, \"Are\r\nyou really satisfied?\"\r\n\r\nI have witnessed some strange happenings in connection with my\r\ninvestigation of occult matters, but to my dying day I shall never\r\nforget the look of blank astonishment on Mr. X--'s face at that moment.\r\n\r\nQuickly recovering himself, however, he at once examined the\r\nsensitive--a little woman, far below the average height, having small\r\nhands and feet, as we could all see quite clearly--and declared that\r\nevery seal and every knot was unbroken, and just as he had left them not\r\nsixty seconds before.\r\n\r\nAmongst other entities who materialized that evening was a young girl of\r\nabout eighteen years of age who stated that when she left her\r\nearth-body she had been a dancer at a cafe in Algiers.\r\n\r\nShe came from the spot where the sensitive was seated, laughing\r\nheartily, stating that the hand and arm belonged to an old English\r\nsailor, whom she spoke of as \"the Captain.\" She said, further, that he\r\nhad been standing with her watching the tying-up process from their\r\nsphere, and laughing at Mr. X--'s vain attempt to prevent the production\r\nof the phenomena. The Captain had very much wished to materialize fully,\r\nso as to surprise Mr. X-- as he stepped back from the sensitive; but,\r\nfinding that he could only get sufficient \"power\" to produce a hand and\r\narm, he was in a bad temper. And this was evidently the case, for during\r\nthe ten minutes that the girl remained talking to us we could now and\r\nthen hear the gruff voice of the Captain rolling out language which can\r\nonly be described as \"forcible and free.\"\r\n\r\nThe experiment lasted for nearly an hour, and at its conclusion Mr. X--\r\nexamined the sensitive, and once again reported that every seal and knot\r\nwere just as he had left them at the commencement of the experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT NO. 4\r\n\r\nPlace--_My House in London. Sensitive D, male, aged about 34._\r\n\r\nOn numerous occasions this sensitive has been seen by all present, in\r\ngaslight shaded by red paper, seated on his chair in a state of deep\r\ntrance, and was heard to be breathing heavily, whilst two materialized\r\nentities stood beside him; or with one beside him, and the other\r\nstanding five to eight feet away from him and close to the sitters.\r\n\r\nAgain, two female entities were seen simultaneously when this male\r\nsensitive was experimenting with us, one of them inside the half-circle\r\nformed by the sixteen sitters, and talking to them in a low sweet voice,\r\nat a distance of about eight feet from the sensitive; whilst the other\r\nfemale entity passed through or over the sitters, and, walking about the\r\nroom outside the half-circle formed by the sitters, came up behind two\r\nof them, and not only spoke audibly to them, but also held a short\r\nconversation with the entity inside the ring, both speaking almost\r\ninstantaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHANTOM ARMIES SEEN IN FRANCE[17]\r\n\r\nBY HEREWARD CARRINGTON\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: By permission of the author.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory abounds in cases showing the apparent intrusion of spiritual\r\nhelp in time of trouble, and in the annals of military history these\r\naccounts are not lacking. On several occasions the Crusaders thought\r\nthat they saw angelic hosts fighting for them--phantom horsemen charging\r\nthe enemy, when their own utter destruction seemed imminent. In the wars\r\nbetween the English and the Scotch, several such cases were cited, and\r\nthe Napoleonic wars also furnished examples. But the most striking\r\nevidence of this character--because the newest--and supported,\r\napparently, by a good deal of first-hand and sincere testimony, is that\r\nafforded by the Phantom Armies seen in France during the retreat of the\r\nBritish army from Mons--the field of Agincourt. Cut off by overwhelming\r\nnumbers, and all but annihilated, the British army fought desperately,\r\nbut the 80,000 were opposed by 300,000 Germans, backed by a terrific\r\nfire of artillery, and were indeed in a critical position. They were\r\nonly saved, as we know, by the heroism of a small force of men--a\r\nrear-guard--who were practically wiped out in consequence. At the most\r\ncritical moment came what appeared to be angelic assistance. The tide of\r\nbattle seemed to be stemmed by supernatural means. In a letter written\r\nby a soldier who actually witnessed these startling events, quoted by\r\nthe Hon. Mrs. St. John Mildmay (_North American Review_, August, 1915),\r\nthe following graphic account is given. Our soldier writes:\r\n\r\n\"The men joked at the shells and found many funny names for them, and\r\nhad bets about them, and greeted them with music-hall songs, as they\r\nscreamed in this terrific cannonade. The climax seemed to have been\r\nreached, but 'a seven-times heated hell' of the enemy's onslaught fell\r\nupon them, rending brother from brother. At that very moment, they saw\r\nfrom their trenches a tremendous host moving against their lines. Five\r\nhundred of the thousand (who had been detailed to fight the rear-guard\r\naction) remained, and as far as they could see the German infantry was\r\npressing on against them, column by column, a gray world of men--10,000\r\nof them, as it appeared afterwards. There was no hope at all. Some of\r\nthem shook hands. One man improvised a new version of the battle song\r\nTipperary, ending 'and we shan't get there!' And all went on firing\r\nsteadily. The enemy dropped line after line, while the few machine guns\r\ndid their best. Every one knew it was of no use. The dead gray bodies\r\nlay in companies and battalions, but others came on and on, swarming and\r\nadvancing from beyond and beyond.\r\n\r\n\"'World without end. Amen!' said one of the British soldiers, with some\r\nirreverence, as he took aim and fired. Then he remembered a vegetarian\r\nrestaurant in London, where he had once or twice eaten queer dishes of\r\ncutlets made of lentils and nuts that pretended to be steaks. On all the\r\nplates in this restaurant a figure of St. George was painted in blue\r\nwith the motto, _Adsit Anglis Sanctus Georgius_ (May St. George be a\r\npresent help to England). The soldier happened to know 'Latin and other\r\nuseless things,' so now, as he fired at the gray advancing mass, 300\r\nyards away, he uttered the pious vegetarian motto. He went on firing to\r\nthe end, till at last Bill on his right had to clout him cheerfully on\r\nthe head to make him stop, pointing out as he did so that the King's\r\nammunition cost money and was not lightly to be wasted. For, as the\r\nLatin scholar uttered his invocation, he felt something between a\r\nshudder and an electric shock pass through his body. The roar of the\r\nbattle died down in his ears to a gentle murmur, and instead of it, he\r\nsays, he heard a great voice louder than a thunder peal, crying 'Array!\r\nArray!' His heart grew hot as a burning coal, then it grew cold as ice\r\nwithin him, for it seemed to him a tumult of voices answered to the\r\nsummons. He heard or seemed to hear thousands shouting:\r\n\r\n     \"'St. George! St. George!\r\n\r\n     \"'Ha! Messire, Ha! Sweet Saint, grant us good deliverance!\r\n\r\n     \"'St. George for Merrie England!\r\n\r\n     \"'Harow! Harow! Monseigneur St. George, succour us, Ha! St.\r\n     George! A low bow, and a strong bow, Knight of Heaven, aid us!'\r\n\r\n\"As the soldier heard these voices, he saw before him, beyond the\r\ntrench, a long line of shapes with a shining about them. They were like\r\nmen who drew the bow, and with another shout their cloud of arrows flew\r\nsinging through the air toward the German host. The other men in the\r\ntrenches were firing all the while. They had no hope, but they aimed\r\njust as if they had been shooting at Bisley.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly one of these lifted up his voice in plain English. 'Gawd help\r\nus!' he bellowed to the man next him, 'but we're bloomin' marvels! Look\r\nat those gray gentlemen! Look at them! They 're not going down in dozens\r\nor hundreds--it's _thousands_ it is! Look, look! There's a regiment gone\r\nwhile I'm talking to ye!'\r\n\r\n\"'Shut it,' the other soldier bellowed, taking aim. 'What are ye talkin'\r\nabout?' But he gulped with astonishment even as he spoke, for indeed the\r\ngray men were falling by the thousands. The English could hear the\r\nguttural scream of their revolvers as they shot, and line after line\r\ncrashed to the earth. All the while the Latin-bred soldier heard the cry\r\n'Harow, Harow! Monseigneur! Dear Saint! Quick to our aid! St. George\r\nhelp us!'\r\n\r\n\"The singing arrows darkened the air, the hordes melted before them.\r\n'More machine guns,' Bill yelled to Tom. 'Don't hear them,' Tom yelled\r\nback, 'but thank God, anyway, that they have got it in the neck!'\r\n\r\n\"In fact, there were ten thousand dead German soldiers left before that\r\nsalient of the English army, and consequently--_no Sedan_. In Germany\r\nthe General Staff decided that the English must have employed turpenite\r\nshells, as no wounds were discernible on the bodies of the dead\r\nsoldiers. But the man who knew what nuts tasted like when they called\r\nthemselves steak, knew also that St. George had brought his Agincourt\r\nBowmen to help the English.\"\r\n\r\nSuch accounts have been confirmed by others. Thus, Miss Phyllis\r\nCampbell, writing in _The Occult Review_ (October, 1915), says:\r\n\r\n\"I tremble, now that it is safely past, to look back on the terrible\r\nweek that brought the Allies to Vitry-le-Francois. We had not had our\r\nclothes off for the whole of that week, because no sooner had we reached\r\nhome, too weary to undress, or to eat, and fallen on our beds, than the\r\n'chug-chug' of the commandant's car would sound into the silence of the\r\ndeserted street, and the horn would imperatively summon us back to\r\nduty--because, in addition to our duties as _ambulancier auxiliare_, we\r\nwere interpreters to the post, now at this moment diminished to half a\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\n\"Returning at 4:30 in the morning, we stood on the end of the platform,\r\nwatching the train crawl through the blue-green mist of the forest into\r\nthe clearing, and draw up with the first wounded from Vitry-le-Francois.\r\nIt was packed with dead and dying and badly wounded. For a time we\r\nforgot our weariness in a race against time--removing the dead and\r\ndying, and attending to those in need. I was bandaging a man's shattered\r\narm with the _majeur_ instructing me, while he stitched a horrible gap\r\nin his head, when Madame de A--, the heroic president of the post, came\r\nand replaced me. 'There is an English in the fifth wagon,' she said. 'He\r\nwants something--I think a holy picture!'\r\n\r\n\"The idea of an English soldier wanting a holy picture struck me, even\r\nin that atmosphere of blood and misery, as something to smile at--but I\r\nhurried away. 'The English' was a Lancashire Fusilier. He was propped in\r\na corner, his left arm tied-up in a peasant woman's handkerchief, and\r\nhis head newly bandaged. He should have been in a state of collapse from\r\nloss of blood, for his tattered uniform was soaked and caked in blood,\r\nand his face paper-white under the dirt of conflict. He looked at me\r\nwith bright, courageous eyes and asked for a picture or a medal (he\r\ndidn't care which) of St. George. I asked him if he was a Catholic.\r\n'No,' he was Wesleyan Methodist, and he wanted a picture or a medal of\r\nSt. George, _because he had seen him on a white horse_, leading the\r\nBritish at Vitry-le-Francois, when the Allies turned.\r\n\r\n\"There was an F. R. A. man, wounded in the leg, sitting beside him on\r\nthe floor; he saw my look of amazement, and hastened in: 'It's true,\r\nsister,' he said. 'We all saw it. First there was a sort of yellow\r\nmist-like, sort of risin' before the Germans as they came on the top of\r\nthe hill--come on like a solid wall, they did--springing out of the\r\nearth just solid--no end to 'em! I just give up. No use fighting the\r\nwhole German race, thinks I; it's all up with _us_. The next minute\r\ncomes this funny cloud of light, and when it clears off, there's a tall\r\nman with yellow hair in golden armor, on a white horse, holding his\r\nsword up, and his mouth open as if he was saying: \"Come on, boys! I'll\r\nput the kybosh on the devils!\" Sort of \"This is my picnic\" expression.\r\nThen, before you could say \"knife,\" the Germans had turned, and we were\r\nafter them, fighting like ninety ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was this?\" I asked. But neither of them could tell. They had\r\nmarched, fighting a rear-guard action, from Mons, till St. George had\r\nappeared through the haze of light, and turned the enemy. They both\r\n_knew_ it was St. George. Hadn't they seen him with a sword on every\r\n'quid' they'd ever seen? The Frenchies had seen him too--ask them; but\r\nthey said it was St. Michael....\"\r\n\r\nMuch additional testimony of a like nature might be given--and has been\r\ncollected by students of psychical research. If the spiritual world ever\r\nintervenes in matters mundane, it assuredly did so on this occasion. And\r\nit could hardly have chosen a more opportune time. Could the aspiring\r\nthoughts of the dead and dying, and those still living and fighting for\r\ntheir country, have drawn \"St. George\" to earth, to aid in again\r\nredeeming his country from a foreign foe? Could a simple \"hallucination\"\r\nhave been so widespread and so prevalent? Or might there not have been\r\nsome spiritual energy behind the visions thus seen--stimulating them,\r\nand inspiring and encouraging the stricken soldiers? We cannot say. We\r\nonly know what the soldiers themselves say; and we also know the\r\nundoubted effects upon the enemy. For on both occasions were the Germans\r\nrepulsed with terrible slaughter. Perhaps the vision of St. George led\r\nour soldiers into closer touch and _rapport_ with the consciousness of\r\nsome high intelligence--or the veil separating the two worlds was\r\nrent--as so often appears to be the case in apparitions and visions of\r\nthis character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTAL OF THE UNKNOWN\r\n\r\nBY ANDREW JACKSON DAVIS, \"THE SEER\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the hour of her death arrived, I was fortunately in a proper state\r\nof mind and body to produce the superior (clairvoyant) condition; but,\r\nprevious to throwing my spirit into that condition, I sought the most\r\nconvenient and favorable position, that I might be allowed to make the\r\nobservations entirely unnoticed and undisturbed. Thus situated and\r\nconditioned, I proceeded to observe and investigate the mysterious\r\nprocesses of dying, and to learn what it is for an individual human\r\nspirit to undergo the changes consequent upon physical death or external\r\ndissolution. They were these:\r\n\r\nI saw that the physical organization could no longer subserve the\r\ndiversified purposes or requirements of the spiritual principle. But the\r\nvarious internal organs of the body appeared to resist the withdrawal of\r\nthe animating soul. The body and the soul, like two friends, strongly\r\nresisted the various circumstances which rendered their eternal\r\nseparation imperative and absolute. These internal conflicts gave rise\r\nto manifestations of what seemed to be, to the material senses, the most\r\nthrilling and painful sensations; but I was unspeakably thankful and\r\ndelighted when I perceived and realized the fact that those physical\r\nmanifestations were indications, not of pain or unhappiness, but simply\r\nthat the spirit was eternally dissolving its co-partnership with the\r\nmaterial organism.\r\n\r\nNow the head of the body became suddenly enveloped in a fine, soft,\r\nmellow, luminous atmosphere; and, as instantly, I saw the cerebrum and\r\nthe cerebellum expand their most interior portions; I saw them\r\ndiscontinue their appropriate galvanic functions; and then I saw that\r\nthey became highly charged with the vital electricity and vital\r\nmagnetism which permeate subordinate systems and structures. That is to\r\nsay, the brain, as a whole, suddenly declared itself to be tenfold more\r\npositive, over the lesser proportions of the body, than it ever was\r\nduring the period of health. This phenomenon invariably precedes\r\nphysical dissolution.\r\n\r\nNow the process of dying, or the spirit's departure from the body, was\r\nfully commenced. The brain began to attract the elements of electricity,\r\nof magnetism, of motion, of life, and of sensation, into its various and\r\nnumerous departments. The head became intensely brilliant; and I\r\nparticularly remarked that just in the same proportion as the\r\nextremities of the organism grow dark and cold, the brain appears light\r\nand glowing.\r\n\r\nNow I saw, in the mellow, spiritual atmosphere which emanated from and\r\nencircled her head, the indistinct outlines of the formation of\r\n_another_ head. This new head unfolded more and more distinctly, and so\r\nindescribably compact and intensely brilliant did it become, that I\r\ncould neither see through it, nor gaze upon it as steadily as I desired.\r\nWhile this spiritual head was being eliminated and organized from out\r\nof and above the material head, I saw that the surrounding aromal\r\natmosphere which had emanated from the material head was in great\r\ncommotion; but, as the new head became more distinct and perfect, this\r\nbrilliant atmosphere gradually disappeared. This taught me that those\r\naromal elements, which were, in the beginning of the metamorphosis,\r\nattracted from the system into the brain, and thence eliminated in the\r\nform of an atmosphere, were indissolubly united in accordance with the\r\ndivine principle of affinity in the universe, which pervades and\r\ndestinates every particle of matter, and developed the spiritual head\r\nwhich I beheld.\r\n\r\nIn the identical manner in which the spiritual head was eliminated and\r\nunchangeably organized, I saw, unfolding in their natural progressive\r\norder, the harmonious development of the neck, the shoulders, the breast\r\nand the entire spiritual organization. It appeared from this, even to an\r\nunequivocal demonstration, that the innumerable particles of what might\r\nbe termed unparticled matter which constitute the man's spiritual\r\nprinciple, are constitutionally endowed with certain elective\r\naffinities, analogous to an immortal friendship. The innate tendencies\r\nwhich the elements and essences of her soul manifested by uniting and\r\norganizing themselves, were the efficient and imminent causes which\r\nunfolded and perfected her spiritual organization. The defects and\r\ndeformities of her physical body were, in the spiritual body which I saw\r\nthus developed, almost completely removed. In other words, it seemed\r\nthat those hereditary obstructions and influences were now removed,\r\nwhich originally arrested the full and proper development of her\r\nphysical constitution; and, therefore, that her spiritual constitution,\r\nbeing elevated above those obstructions, was enabled to unfold and\r\nperfect itself, in accordance with the universal tendencies of all\r\ncreated things.\r\n\r\nWhile this spiritual formation was going on, which was perfectly visible\r\nto my spiritual perceptions, the material body manifested, to the outer\r\nvision of observing individuals in the room, many symptoms of uneasiness\r\nand pain; but the indications were totally deceptive; they were wholly\r\ncaused by the departure of the vital or spiritual forces from the\r\nextremities and viscera into the brain, and thence into the ascending\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nThe spirit arose at right angles over the head or brain of the deserted\r\nbody. But immediately previous to the final dissolution of the\r\nrelationship which had for so many years subsisted between the two, the\r\nspiritual and material bodies, I saw--playing energetically between the\r\nfeet of the elevated spiritual body and the head of the prostrate\r\nphysical body--a bright stream or current of vital electricity. And here\r\nI perceived what I had never before obtained a knowledge of, that a\r\nsmall portion of this vital electrical element returned to the deserted\r\nbody immediately subsequent to the separation of the umbilical thread;\r\nand that that portion of this element which passed back into the earthly\r\norganism instantly diffused itself through the entire structure, and\r\nthus prevented immediate decomposition.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the spirit, whose departing hour I thus watched, was wholly\r\ndisengaged from the tenacious physical body, I directed my attention to\r\nthe movements and emotions of the former; and I saw her begin to\r\nbreathe the most interior or spiritual portions of the surrounding\r\nterrestrial atmosphere. At first it seemed with difficulty that she\r\ncould breathe the new medium; but in a few seconds she inhaled and\r\nexhaled the spiritual elements of nature with the greatest possible ease\r\nand delight. And now I saw that she was in possession of exterior and\r\nphysical proportions, which were identical, in every possible\r\nparticular--improved and beautified--with those proportions which\r\ncharacterized her earthly organization. Indeed, so much like her former\r\nself was she that, had her friends beheld her as I did, they certainly\r\nwould have exclaimed--as we often do upon the sudden return of a\r\nlong-absent friend, who leaves us and returns in health--'Why, how well\r\nyou look! How improved you are!' Such was the nature--most beautifying\r\nin their extent--of the improvements that were wrought upon her.\r\n\r\nI saw her continue to conform and accustom herself to the new elements\r\nand elevating sensations which belong to the inner life. I did not\r\nparticularly notice the workings and emotions of her newly-awakening and\r\nfast-unfolding spirit, except that I was careful to remark her\r\nphilosophical tranquillity throughout the entire process, and her\r\nnon-participation with the different members of her family in their\r\nunrestrained bewailing of her departure from the earth, to unfold in\r\nLove and Wisdom throughout eternal spheres. She understood at a glance\r\nthat they could only gaze upon the cold and lifeless form, which she had\r\nbut just deserted; and she readily comprehended the fact that it was\r\nowing to a want of true knowledge upon their parts that they thus\r\nvehemently regretted her merely physical death.\r\n\r\nThe period required to accomplish the entire change which I saw was not\r\nfar from two hours and a half; but this furnished no rule as to the time\r\nrequired for every spirit to elevate and reorganize itself above the\r\nhead of the outer form. Without changing my position or spiritual\r\nperceptions I continued to observe the movements of her new-born spirit.\r\nAs soon as she became accustomed to her new elements which surrounded\r\nher, she descended from her elevated position, which was immediately\r\nover the body, by an effort of the will-power, and directly passed out\r\nof the door of the bedroom in which she had lain, in the material form,\r\nprostrated with disease for several weeks. It being in a summer month,\r\nthe doors were all open, and her egress from the house was attended with\r\nno obstruction. I saw her pass through the adjoining room, out of the\r\ndoor, and step from the house into the atmosphere! I was overwhelmed\r\nwith delight and astonishment when, for the first time, I realized the\r\nuniversal truth that the spiritual organization can tread the\r\natmosphere, which is impossible while in the coarser earthly form--so\r\nmuch more refined is man's spiritual constitution. She walked in the\r\natmosphere as easily, and in the same manner, as we tread the earth and\r\nascend an eminence. Immediately upon her emergement from the house, she\r\nwas joined by two friendly spirits from the spiritual country, and after\r\ntenderly recognizing and communing with each other, the three, in the\r\nmost graceful manner, began ascending obliquely through the ethereal\r\nenvelopment of her globe. They walked so naturally and fraternally\r\ntogether that I could scarcely realize the fact that they trod the\r\nair--they seemed to be walking upon the side of a glorious but familiar\r\nmountain. I continued to gaze upon them until the distance shut them\r\nfrom my view,--whereupon I returned to my external and ordinary\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis account of the facts--of what actually happened at death--is\r\nconfirmed by numerous other witnesses, who agree as to the main\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERNORMAL: EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\nBY ST. JOHN B. SEYMOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Seymour was a little girl she resided in Dublin; amongst the\r\nmembers of the family was her paternal grandmother. This old lady was\r\nnot as kind as she might have been to her granddaughter, and\r\nconsequently the latter was somewhat afraid of her. In process of time\r\nthe grandmother died. Mrs. Seymour, who was then about eight years of\r\nage, had to pass the door of the room where the death occurred in order\r\nto reach her own bedroom, which was a flight higher up. Past this door\r\nthe child used to fly in terror with all possible speed. On one\r\noccasion, however, as she was preparing to make the usual rush past, she\r\ndistinctly felt a hand placed on her shoulder, and became conscious of a\r\nvoice saying, \"Don't be afraid, Mary!\" From that day on the child never\r\nhad the least feeling of fear, and always walked quietly past the door.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. D. B. Knox sends a curious personal experience, which was\r\nshared by him with three other people. He writes as follows: \"Not very\r\nlong ago my wife and I were preparing to retire for the night. A niece,\r\nwho was in the house, was in her bedroom and the door was open. The maid\r\nhad just gone to her room. All four of us distinctly heard the heavy\r\nstep of a man walking along the corridor, apparently in the direction of\r\nthe bathroom. We searched the whole house immediately, but no one was\r\ndiscovered. Nothing untoward happened except the death of the maid's\r\nmother about a fortnight later. It was a detached house, so that the\r\nnoise could not have been made by the neighbors.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following tale the \"double\" or \"wraith\" of a living man was seen\r\nby three different people, one of whom, our correspondent, saw it\r\nthrough a telescope. She writes: \"In May, 1883, the parish of A-- was\r\nvacant, so Mr. D--, the Diocesan Curate, used to come out to take\r\nservice on Sundays. One day there were two funerals to be taken, the one\r\nat a graveyard some distance off, the other at A-- churchyard. My\r\nbrother was at both, the far-off one being taken the first. The house we\r\nthen lived in looked down towards A--churchyard, which was about a\r\nquarter of a mile away. From an upper window my sister and I saw _two_\r\nsurpliced figures going out to meet the coffin, and said, 'Why, there\r\nare two clergy!' having supposed that there would be only Mr. D--. I,\r\nbeing short-sighted, used a telescope, and saw the two surplices showing\r\nbetween the people. But when my brother returned he said: 'A strange\r\nthing has happened. Mr. D-- and Mr. W-- (curate of a neighboring parish)\r\ntook the far-off funeral. I saw them both again at A--, but when I went\r\ninto the vestry I only saw Mr. W--. I asked where Mr. D-- was, and he\r\nreplied that he had left immediately after the first funeral, as he had\r\nto go to Kilkenny, and that he (Mr. W--) had come on _alone_ to take the\r\nfuneral at A--.'\"\r\n\r\nHere is a curious tale from the city of Limerick of a lady's \"double\"\r\nbeing seen, with no consequent results. It is sent by Mr. Richard Hogan\r\nas the personal experience of his sister, Mrs. Mary Murnane. On\r\nSaturday, October 25, 1913, at half-past four o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nMr. Hogan left the house in order to purchase some cigarettes. A quarter\r\nof an hour afterwards Mrs. Murnane went down the town to do some\r\nbusiness. As she was walking down George Street she saw a group of four\r\npersons standing on the pavement engaged in conversation. They were her\r\nbrother, a Mr. O'S--, and two ladies, a Miss P. O'D--, and her sister,\r\nMiss M. O'D--. She recognized the latter, as her face was partly turned\r\ntowards her, and noted that she was dressed in a knitted coat, and light\r\nblue hat, while in her left hand she held a bag or purse; the other\r\nlady's back was turned towards her. As Mrs. Murnane was in a hurry to\r\nget her business done she determined to pass them by without being\r\nnoticed, but a number of people coming in the opposite direction blocked\r\nthe way, and compelled her to walk quite close to the group of four, but\r\nthey were so intent on listening to what one lady was saying that they\r\ntook no notice of her. The speaker appeared to be Miss M. O'D--, and\r\nthough Mrs. Murnane did not actually hear her _speak_ as she passed her,\r\nyet from their attitudes the other three seemed to be listening to what\r\nshe was saying, and she heard her _laugh_ when right behind her--not the\r\nlaugh of her sister P--and the laugh was repeated after she had left the\r\ngroup a little behind.\r\n\r\nSo far there is nothing out of the common. When Mrs. Murnane returned to\r\nher house about an hour later she found her brother Richard there\r\nbefore her. She casually mentioned to him how she had passed him and his\r\nthree companions on the pavement. To which he replied that she was quite\r\ncorrect except in one point, namely that there were only _three_ in the\r\ngroup, as M. O'D-- _was not present_, as she had not come to Limerick at\r\nall that day. She then described to him the exact position each one of\r\nthe four occupied, and the clothes worn by them, to all of which facts\r\nhe assented, except as to the presence of Miss M. O'D--. Mrs. Murnane\r\nadds, \"That is all I can say in the matter, but most certainly the\r\nfourth person was in the group, as I both saw and heard her. She wore\r\nthe same clothes I had seen on her previously, with the exception of the\r\nhat; but the following Saturday she had on the same colored hat I had\r\nseen on her the previous Saturday. When I told her about it she was as\r\nmuch mystified as I was and am. My brother stated that there was no\r\nlaugh from any of the three present.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. G. Kelly sends an experience of a \"wraith\" which seems in some\r\nmysterious way to have been conjured up in her mind by the description\r\nshe had heard, and then externalized. She writes: \"About four years ago\r\na musical friend of ours was staying in the house. He and my husband\r\nwere playing and singing Dvorak's 'Spectre's Bride,' a work which he had\r\nstudied with the composer himself. This music appealed very much to\r\nboth, and they were excited and enthusiastic over it. Our friend was\r\ngiving many personal reminiscences of Dvorak, and his method of\r\nexplaining the way he wanted his work done. I was sitting by, an\r\ninterested listener, for some time. On getting up at last, and going\r\ninto the drawing-room, I was startled and somewhat frightened to find a\r\nman standing there in a shadowy part of the room. I saw him distinctly,\r\nand could describe his appearance accurately. I called out, and the two\r\nmen ran in, but as the apparition only lasted for a second, they were\r\ntoo late. I described the man whom I had seen, whereupon our friend\r\nexclaimed, 'Why, that was Dvorak himself!' At that time I had never seen\r\na picture of Dvorak, but when our friend returned to London he sent me\r\none which I recognized as the likeness of the man whom I had seen in our\r\ndrawing-room.\"\r\n\r\nA curious vision, a case of second sight, in which a quite unimportant\r\nevent, previously unknown, was revealed, is sent by the percipient, who\r\nis a lady well known to both the compilers, and a life-long friend of\r\none of them. She says: \"Last summer I sent a cow to the fair of\r\nLimerick, a distance of about thirteen miles, and the men who took her\r\nthere the day before the fair left her in a paddock for the night close\r\nto Limerick city. I awoke up very early next morning, and was fully\r\nawake when I saw (not with my ordinary eyesight, but apparently _inside_\r\nmy head) a light, an intensely brilliant light, and in it I saw the back\r\ngate being opened by a red-haired woman and the cow I had supposed in\r\nthe fair walking through the gate. I then knew that the cow must be\r\nhome, and going to the yard later on I was met by the wife of the man\r\nwho was in charge in a great state of excitement. 'Oh law! Miss,' she\r\nexclaimed, 'you'll be mad! Didn't Julia [a red-haired woman] find the\r\ncow outside the lodge gate as she was going out at 4 o'clock to the\r\nmilking!' That's my tale--perfectly true, and I would give a good deal\r\nto be able to control that light, and see more if I could.\"\r\n\r\nAnother curious vision was seen by a lady who is also a friend of both\r\nthe compilers. One night she was kneeling at her bedside saying her\r\nprayers (hers was the only bed in the room), when suddenly she felt a\r\ndistinct touch on her shoulder. She turned round in the direction of the\r\ntouch and saw at the end of the room a bed, with a pale,\r\nindistinguishable figure laid therein, and what appeared to be a\r\nclergyman standing over it. About a week later she fell into a long and\r\ndangerous illness.\r\n\r\nAn account of a dream which implied an extraordinary coincidence, if\r\ncoincidence it be and nothing more, was sent as follows by a\r\ncorrespondent, who requested that no names be published. \"That which I\r\nam about to relate has a peculiar interest for me, inasmuch as the\r\ncentral figure in it was my own grand-aunt, and moreover the principal\r\nwitness (if I may use such a term) was my father. At the period during\r\nwhich this strange incident occurred my father was living with his aunt\r\nand some other relatives.\r\n\r\n\"One morning at the breakfast-table, my grand-aunt announced that she\r\nhad had a most peculiar dream during the previous night. My father, who\r\nwas always very interested in that kind of thing, took down in his\r\nnotebook all the particulars concerning it. They were as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My grand-aunt dreamt that she was in a cemetery, which she recognized\r\nas Glasnevin, and as she gazed at the memorials of the dead which lay so\r\nthick around, one stood out most conspicuously, and caught her eye,\r\nfor she saw clearly cut on the cold white stone _an inscription bearing\r\nher own name_:\r\n\r\n            CLARE.S.D--\r\n      Died 14th of March, 1873\r\n    Dearly loved and ever mourned\r\n              R.I.P.\r\n\r\nwhile, to add to the peculiarity of it, the date on the stone as given\r\nabove was, from the day of her dream, exactly a year in advance.\r\n\r\n\"My grand-aunt was not very nervous, and soon the dream faded from her\r\nmind. Months rolled by, and one morning at breakfast it was noticed that\r\nmy grand-aunt had not appeared, but as she was a very religious woman it\r\nwas thought that she had gone out to church. However, as she did not\r\nappear my father sent someone to her room to see if she were there, and\r\nas no answer was given to repeated knocking the door was opened, and my\r\ngrand-aunt was found kneeling at her bedside, dead. The day of her death\r\nwas March 14, 1873, corresponding exactly with the date seen in her\r\ndream a twelvemonth before. My grand-aunt was buried in Glasnevin, and\r\non her tombstone (a white marble slab) was placed the inscription which\r\nshe had read in her dream.\" Our correspondent sent us a photograph of\r\nthe stone and its inscription.\r\n\r\nThe present Archdeacon of Limerick, Ven. J. A. Haydn, LL.D., sends the\r\nfollowing experience: \"In the year 1870 I was rector of the little rural\r\nparish of Chapel Russell. One autumn day the rain fell with a quiet,\r\nsteady, and hopeless persistence from morning to night. Wearied at\r\nlength from the gloom, and tired of reading and writing, I determined\r\nto walk to the church about half a mile away, and pass a half-hour\r\nplaying the harmonium, returning for the lamp-light and tea.\r\n\r\n\"I wrapped up, put the key of the church in my pocket, and started.\r\nArriving at the church, I walked up the straight avenue, bordered with\r\ngraves and tombs on either side, while the soft, steady rain quietly\r\npattered on the trees. When I reached the church door, before putting\r\nthe key in the lock, moved by some indefinable impulse I stood on the\r\ndoorstep, turned round, and looked back upon the path I had just\r\ntrodden. My amazement may be imagined when I saw, seated on a low,\r\ntabular tombstone close to the avenue, a lady with her back towards me.\r\nShe was wearing a black velvet jacket or short cape, with a narrow\r\nborder of vivid white; her head and luxuriant jet-black hair were\r\nsurmounted by a hat of the shape and make that I think used to be called\r\nat that time a 'turban'; it was also of black velvet, with a snow-white\r\nwing or feather at the right-hand side of it. It may be seen how\r\ndeliberately and minutely I observed the appearance, when I can thus\r\nrecall it after more than forty years.\r\n\r\n\"Actuated by a desire to attract the attention of the lady, and induce\r\nher to look towards me, I noisily inserted the key in the door, and\r\nsuddenly opened it with a rusty crack. Turning around to see the effect\r\nof my policy--the lady was gone!--vanished. Not yet daunted, I hurried\r\nto the place, which was not ten paces away, and closely searched the\r\nstone and the space all around it, but utterly in vain; there were\r\nabsolutely no traces of the late presence of a human being! I may add\r\nthat nothing particular or remarkable followed the singular apparition,\r\nand that I never heard anything calculated to throw any light on the\r\nmystery.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a story of a ghost who knew what it wanted--and got it! \"In the\r\npart of County Wicklow from which my people come,\" writes a Miss D--,\r\n\"there was a family who were not exactly related, but of course of the\r\nclan. Many years ago a young daughter, aged about twenty, died. Before\r\nher death she had directed her parents to bury her in a certain\r\ngraveyard. But for some reason they did not do so, and from that hour\r\nshe gave them no peace. She appeared to them at all hours, especially\r\nwhen they went to the well for water. So distracted were they, that at\r\nlength they got permission to exhume the remains and have them\r\nreinterred in the desired graveyard. This they did by torchlight--a\r\nweird scene truly! I can vouch for the truth of this latter portion, at\r\nall events, as some of my own relatives were present.\"\r\n\r\nMr. T. J. Westropp contributes a tale of a ghost of an unusual type,\r\ni.e. one which actually did communicate matters of importance to his\r\nfamily. \"A lady who related many ghost stories to me, also told me how,\r\nafter her father's death, the family could not find some papers or\r\nreceipts of value. One night she awoke, and heard a sound which she at\r\nonce recognized as the footsteps of her father, who was lame. The door\r\ncreaked, and she prayed that she might be able to see him. Her prayer\r\nwas granted: she saw him distinctly holding a yellow parchment book tied\r\nwith tape. 'F--, child,' said he, 'this is the book your mother is\r\nlooking for. It is in the third drawer of the cabinet near the\r\ncross-door; tell your mother to be more careful in future about\r\nbusiness papers.' Incontinently he vanished, and she at once awoke her\r\nmother, in whose room she was sleeping, who was very angry and ridiculed\r\nthe story, but the girl's earnestness at length impressed her. She got\r\nup, went to the old cabinet, and at once found the missing book in the\r\nthird drawer.\"\r\n\r\nHere is another tale of an equally useful and obliging ghost. \"A\r\ngentleman, a relative of my own,\" writes a lady, \"often received\r\nwarnings from his dead father of things that were about to happen.\r\nBesides the farm on which he lived, he had another some miles away which\r\nadjoined a large demesne. Once in a great storm a fir-tree was blown\r\ndown in the demesne, and fell into his field. The woodranger came to him\r\nand told him he might as well cut up the tree, and take it away.\r\nAccordingly one day he set out for this purpose, taking with him two men\r\nand a cart. He got into the fields by a stile, while his men went on to\r\na gate. As he approached a gap between two fields he saw his father\r\nstanding in it, as plainly as he ever saw him in life, and beckoning him\r\nback warningly. Unable to understand this, he still advanced, whereupon\r\nhis father looked very angry, and his gestures became imperious. This\r\ninduced him to turn away, so he sent his men home, and left the tree\r\nuncut. He subsequently discovered that a plot had been laid by the\r\nwoodranger, who coveted his farm, and who hoped to have him dispossessed\r\nby accusing him of stealing the tree.\"\r\n\r\nA clergyman in the diocese of Clogher gave a personal experience of\r\ntable-turning to the present Dean of St. Patrick's, who kindly sent the\r\nsame to the writer. He said: \"When I was a young man, I met some\r\nfriends one evening, and we decided to amuse ourselves with\r\ntable-turning. The local dispensary was vacant at the time, so we said\r\nthat if the table would work we should ask who would be appointed as\r\nmedical officer. As we sat round it touching it with our hands it began\r\nto knock. We said:\r\n\r\n\"'Who are you?'\r\n\r\n\"The table spelt out the name of a bishop of the Church of Ireland. We\r\nasked, thinking that the answer was absurd, as we knew him to be alive\r\nand well:\r\n\r\n\"'Are you dead?'\r\n\r\n\"The table answered 'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\"We laughed at this and asked:\r\n\r\n\"'Who will be appointed to the dispensary!'\r\n\r\n\"The table spelt out the name of a stranger, who was not one of the\r\ncandidates, whereupon we left off, thinking that the whole thing was\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning I saw in the papers that the bishop in question had\r\ndied that afternoon about two hours before our meeting, and a few days\r\nafterwards I saw the name of the stranger as the new dispensary doctor.\r\nI got such a shock that I determined never to have anything to do with\r\ntable-turning again.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extraordinary personal experience is sent by a lady,\r\nwell-known to the present writer, but who requests that all names be\r\nomitted. Whatever explanation we may give of it, the good faith of the\r\ntale is beyond doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Two or three months after my father-in-law's death, my husband, myself,\r\nand three small sons lived in the west of Ireland. As my husband was a\r\nyoung barrister, he had to be absent from home a good deal. My three\r\nboys slept in my bedroom, the eldest being about four, the youngest some\r\nmonths. A fire was kept up every night, and with a young child to look\r\nafter, I was naturally awake more than once during the night. For many\r\nnights I believed I distinctly saw my father-in-law sitting by the\r\nfireside. This happened, not once or twice, but many times. He was\r\npassionately fond of his eldest grandson, who lay sleeping calmly in his\r\ncot. Being so much alone probably made me restless and uneasy, though I\r\nnever felt afraid. I mentioned this strange thing to a friend who had\r\nknown and liked my father-in-law, and she advised me to 'have his soul\r\nlaid,' as she termed it. Though I was a Protestant and she was a Roman\r\nCatholic (as had also been my father-in-law), yet I fell in with her\r\nsuggestion. She told me to give a coin to the next beggar that came to\r\nthe house, telling him (or her) to pray for the rest of Mr. So-and-so's\r\nsoul. A few days later a beggar-woman and her children came to the door,\r\nto whom I gave a coin and stated my desire. To my great surprise I\r\nlearned from her manner that such requests were not unusual. Well, she\r\nwent down on her knees on the steps, and prayed with apparent\r\nearnestness and devotion that his soul might find repose. Once again he\r\nappeared, and seemed to say to me, 'Why did you do that, E----? To come\r\nand sit here was the only comfort I had.' Never again did he appear, and\r\nstrange to say, after a lapse of more than thirty years I have felt\r\nregret at my selfishness in interfering.\r\n\r\n\"After his death, as he lay in the house awaiting burial, and I was in a\r\nhouse some ten miles away, I thought that he came and told me that I\r\nwould have a hard life, which turned out only too truly. I was then\r\nyoung, and full of life, with every hope of a prosperous future.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the strange beliefs to be found in Ireland that in the Black Dog\r\nis the most widespread. There is hardly a parish in the country but\r\ncould contribute some tale relative to this specter, though the majority\r\nof these are short, and devoid of interest. There is said to be such a\r\ndog just outside the avenue gate of Donohill Rectory, but neither of the\r\ncompilers have had the good luck to see it. It may be, as some hold,\r\nthat this animal was originally a cloud or nature-myth; at all events,\r\nit has now descended to the level of an ordinary haunting. The most\r\ncircumstantial story that we have met with relative to the Black Dog is\r\nthat related as follows by a clergyman of the Church of Ireland, who\r\nrequests us to refrain from publishing his name.\r\n\r\n\"In my childhood I lived in the country. My father, in addition to his\r\nprofessional duties, sometimes did a little farming in an amateurish\r\nsort of way. He did not keep a regular staff of laborers, and\r\nconsequently when anything extra had to be done, such as hay-cutting or\r\nharvesting, he used to employ day-laborers to help with the work. At\r\nsuch times I used to enjoy being in the fields with the men, listening\r\nto their conversation. On one occasion I heard a laborer remark that he\r\nhad once seen the devil! Of course I was interested and asked him to\r\ngive me his experience. He said he was walking along a certain road, and\r\nwhen he came to a point where there was an entrance to a private place\r\n(the spot was well known to me), he saw a black dog sitting on the\r\nroadside. At the time he paid no attention to it, thinking it was an\r\nordinary retriever, but after he had passed on about two or three\r\nhundred yards he found the dog was beside him, and then he noticed that\r\nits eyes were blood-red. He stooped down, and picked up some stones in\r\norder to frighten it away, but though he threw the stones at it they did\r\nnot injure it, nor indeed did they seem to have any effect. Suddenly,\r\nafter a few moments, the dog vanished from his sight.\r\n\r\n\"Such was the laborer's tale. After some years, during which time I had\r\nforgotten altogether about the man's story, some friends of my own\r\nbought the place at the entrance to which the apparition had been seen.\r\nWhen my friends went to reside there I was a constant visitor at their\r\nhouse. Soon after their arrival they began to be troubled by the\r\nappearance of a black dog. Though I never saw it myself, it appeared to\r\nmany members of the family. The avenue leading to the house was a long\r\none, and it was customary for the dog to appear and accompany people for\r\nthe greater portion of the way. Such an effect had this on my friends\r\nthat they soon gave up the house, and went to live elsewhere. This was a\r\ncurious corroboration of the laborer's tale.\"\r\n\r\nA distinction must be drawn between the so-called _Headless_ Coach,\r\nwhich portends death, and the _Phantom_ Coach, which appears to be a\r\nharmless sort of vehicle. With regard to the latter we give two tales\r\nbelow, the first of which was sent by a lady whose father was a\r\nclergyman, and a gold medalist of Trinity College, Dublin.\r\n\r\n\"Some years ago my family lived in County Down. Our house was some way\r\nout of a fair-sized manufacturing town, and had a short avenue which\r\nended in a gravel sweep in front of the hall door. One winter's evening,\r\nwhen my father was returning from a sick call, a carriage going at a\r\nsharp pace passed him on the avenue. He hurried on, thinking it was some\r\nparticular friends, but when he reached the door no carriage was to be\r\nseen, so he concluded it must have gone round to the stables. The\r\nservant who answered his ring said that no visitors had been there, and\r\nhe, feeling certain that the girl had made some mistake, or that some\r\none else had answered the door, came into the drawing-room to make\r\nfurther inquiries. No visitors had come, however, though those sitting\r\nin the drawing-room had also heard the carriage drive up.\r\n\r\n\"My father was most positive as to what he had seen, viz. a closed\r\ncarriage with lamps lit; and let me say at once that he was a clergyman\r\nwho was known throughout the whole of the north of Ireland as a most\r\nlevel-headed man, and yet to the day of his death he would insist that\r\nhe met that carriage on our avenue.\r\n\r\n\"One day in July one of our servants was given leave to go home for the\r\nday, but was told she must return by a certain train. For some reason\r\nshe did not come by it, but by a much later one, and rushed into the\r\nkitchen in a most penitent frame of mind. 'I am so sorry to be late,'\r\nshe told the cook, 'especially as there were visitors. I suppose they\r\nstayed to supper, as they were so late going away, for I met the\r\ncarriage on the avenue.' The cook thereupon told her that no one had\r\nbeen at the house, and hinted that she must have seen the\r\nghost-carriage, a statement that alarmed her very much, as the story was\r\nwell known in the town, and car-drivers used to whip up their horses as\r\nthey passed our gate, while pedestrians refused to go at all except in\r\nnumbers. We have often heard the carriage, but these are the only two\r\noccasions on which I can positively assert that it was seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe following personal experience of the phantom coach was given to the\r\npresent writer by Mr. Matthias Fitzgerald, coachman to Miss Cooke, of\r\nCappagh House, County Limerick. He stated that one moonlight night he\r\nwas driving along the road from Askeaton to Limerick when he heard\r\ncoming up behind him the roll of wheels, the clatter of horses' hoofs,\r\nand the jingling of the bits. He drew over to his own side to let this\r\ncarriage pass, but nothing passed. He then looked back, but could see\r\nnothing, the road was perfectly bare and empty, though the sounds were\r\nperfectly audible. This continued for about a quarter of an hour or so,\r\nuntil he came to a cross-road, down one arm of which he had to turn. As\r\nhe turned off he heard the phantom carriage dash by rapidly along the\r\nstraight road. He stated that other persons had had similar experiences\r\non the same road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE-SPIRITS OR ELEMENTALS[18]\r\n\r\nBY NIZIDA\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: From Journal of Proceedings of Theosophical Society.]\r\n\r\n     \"Life is one all-pervading principle, and even the thing that\r\n     seems to die and putrefy but engenders new life and changes to\r\n     new forms of matter. Reasoning, then, by analogy--if not a\r\n     leaf, if not a drop of water, but is, no less than yonder star,\r\n     a habitable and breathing world, common sense would suffice to\r\n     teach that the circumfluent Infinite, which you call space--the\r\n     boundless Impalpable which divides the earth from the moon and\r\n     stars--is filled also with its correspondent and appropriate\r\n     life.\"--ZANONI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last fifty years the human mind has been awakening slowly to\r\nthe fact that there is a world, invisible to ordinary powers of vision,\r\nexisting in close juxtaposition to the world cognized by our material\r\nsenses. This world, or condition of existence for more ethereal beings,\r\nhas been variously called Spirit-world, Summer-land, Astral-world,\r\nHades, Kama-loca, or Desire-world, etc. Slowly and with difficulty do\r\nideas upon the nature and characteristics of this world dawn upon the\r\nmodern mind. The imagination, swayed by pictures of sensuous life,\r\nrevels in the fantastic imagery it attributes to this unknown and dimly\r\nconceived state of existence, more often picturing what is false than\r\nwhat is true. Generally speaking, the most crude conceptions are\r\nentertained; these embrace but two conditions of life, the embodied and\r\ndisembodied, for which there are only the earth and heaven, or hell,\r\nwith that intermediate state accepted by Roman Catholics, called\r\npurgatory. There is, therefore, for such minds, only two orders of\r\nbeings, _i.e._, mankind, and angels or devils, categorically termed\r\n_spirits_; but what would be the mode of life of those spirits, is a\r\nsubject upon which ordinary intellects can throw no light at all. Their\r\nideas are walled in by an impenetrable darkness, and not a ray of light\r\nglimmers across the unfathomable gulf lying beyond the grave; that\r\nportal of death which, for them, opens upon unknown darkness, and closes\r\nupon the light, vivacity, and gaiety of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the beings we would term _disembodied_ do actually inhabit\r\nbodies of an aerial substance, invisible to our grosser senses, in a\r\nworld exactly suited to their needs, surpasses the comprehension of an\r\nordinary understanding, which can conceive only of gross matter, visible\r\nand tangible. Yet science begins to talk of _mind-stuff_, or\r\n_soul-substance_, in reality that ethereal substance which ranks next to\r\ndense matter, and which it wears as an external, more hardened shell.\r\nFor there is space within space. Once realizing the existence of an\r\n_inner world_, we shall find that all our ideas concerning space, time,\r\nand every particular of our existence, and the world we live in must\r\nbecome entirely revolutionized.\r\n\r\nThe principal source of knowledge which has been opened in modern times\r\nconcerning the next state of existence has revealed itself in a manner\r\nhomogeneous to itself. It has come by an interior method--a revelation\r\nfrom within acting upon the without. The inner world, although always\r\nacting upon and through its external covering, in a hidden or veiled\r\nway, as from an inscrutable cause, has manifested itself in a manner\r\nmore overt and cognizable by the bodily senses of man. At least that\r\nwhich has usually been termed, with more or less awe, the\r\n_supernatural_, the _ghostly_, has impinged upon the mental incrassation\r\nof sensual man as a thing to be reckoned with in daily life; no longer\r\nto be relegated to the region of vague darkness _d'outre tombe_. Hence\r\nthe human mind is being awakened to study and dive into the depths of\r\nthat life within life, wherein dwell the disembodied, the so-called\r\n_dead_, the angels, and, _per contra_, the devils. Those hidden aerial\r\nand ethereal regions, wherein the _souls_ of things, and beings, draw\r\nlife from the bosom of nature; wherein they find their _active_ habitat;\r\nwherein nature keeps a store of objects more wonderful, and infinitely\r\nmore varied, than serve for her regions of dense matter; wherein man can\r\ndiscern the occult causes and beginnings of all things, even of his own\r\nthoughts; and whereupon he learns, at length, that he possesses the\r\npower of projecting by thought-creation forms more or less endued with\r\nlife and intelligence, which compose his mental world, and with which\r\nhe, as it were, \"peoples space.\" He finds the sphere of his\r\nresponsibilities immensely enlarged by this new knowledge, of which he\r\nis taking the first honeyed sips, delighted with the self-importance\r\nwhich the heretofore unsuspected power of diving into the unseen seems\r\nto bestow. If hitherto he has had to hold himself responsible for the\r\nconsequences of his external actions, that they should not militate\r\nagainst the order of society as regards the laws of morality and virtue,\r\nhe has at least acted upon the impression that his _secret thoughts_\r\nwere his own, and remained with him, affecting no one but himself; were\r\nincognizable in their veiled chambers, and of which it was not necessary\r\nto take any notice; the transitory, evanescent, spontaneous workings of\r\nmind, unknown and inscrutable, which begin and end like the flight of a\r\nbird, whence coming and where going it is impossible to know.\r\n\r\nBy the first faint gleams of the light of hidden wisdom, which are\r\nbeginning to dawn upon his mind, he now perceives that responsibility\r\ndoes not end upon the plane of earth, but extends into the aerial\r\nregions of that inner world where his thoughts are no longer secret, and\r\nwhere they affect the astral currents, acting for the good or detriment\r\nof others to almost infinite extent; that he may act upon the ambient\r\natmospheres, not only of the outer but inner planes of life, like a\r\nplant of poisonous exhalations, if his thoughts be not pure and good;\r\npeopling _unseen_ space with the outcome of a debased mind, in the shape\r\nof hideous and maleficent creatures. He becomes responsible, therefore,\r\nfor the consequences of his mental actions and thought-life, as well as\r\nthose actions carefully prepared to pass unchallenged before this\r\nworld's gaze.\r\n\r\nDiving into the unseen by the light of the new spiritual knowledge now\r\nradiating into all minds, we learn that there are three degrees of life\r\nin man, the material, the aerial, and the ethereal, corresponding to\r\nbody, soul, and spirit; and that there are three corresponding planes of\r\nexistence inhabited by beings suited to them.\r\n\r\nThe subject of our paper will limit us at present to the aerial, or\r\nsoul-plane--the next contiguous, or astral world. The beings that more\r\nespecially live in this realm of the soul, have by common consent been\r\ntermed _elementals_. Nature in illimitable space teems with life in\r\nforms ethereal, evanescent as thought itself, or more objectively\r\ncondensed and solidified, according to the inherent attraction which\r\nholds them together; enduring according to the force, energy, or power\r\nwhich gave them birth; intelligent, or non-intelligent, from the same\r\nsource, which is mental. These spirits of the soul-world are possessed\r\nof aerial bodies, and their world has its own firmament, its own\r\natmosphere and conditions of existence, its own objects, scenes,\r\nhabitations. Yet their world and the world of man intermingle,\r\ninterpenetrate, and \"throw their shadows upon each other,\" says\r\nParacelsus. Again, he says: \"As there are in our world water and fire,\r\nharmonies and contrasts, visible bodies and invisible essences, likewise\r\nthese beings are varied in their constitution, and have their own\r\npeculiarities, for which human beings have no comprehension.\"\r\n\r\nMatter, as known to men in bodies, is seen and felt by means of the\r\nphysical senses; but to beings not provided with such senses, the things\r\nof our world are as invisible and intangible as things of more ethereal\r\nsubstance are to our grosser senses. Elementals which find their habitat\r\nin the interior of the earth's shell, usually called _gnomes_, are not\r\nconscious of the density of the element of earth as we perceive it; but\r\nbreathe in a free atmosphere, and behold objects of which we cannot form\r\nthe remotest conception. In like manner exist the _undines_ in water,\r\n_sylphs_ in air, and _salamanders_ in fire. The elementals of the air,\r\nsylphs, are said to be friendly towards man; those of the water,\r\nundines, are malicious. The salamanders can, but rarely do, associate\r\nwith man, \"on account of the fiery nature of the element they inhabit.\"\r\nThe pigmies (gnomes) are friendly; but as they are the guardians of\r\ntreasure they usually oppose the approach of man, baffling by many\r\nmysterious arts the selfish greed of seekers for buried wealth. We,\r\nhowever, read of their alluring miners either by stroke of pick, or\r\nhammer, or by floating lights to the best mineral \"leads.\" Paracelsus\r\nsays of these subterranean elementals that they build houses, vaults,\r\nand strange-looking edifices of certain immaterial substances unknown to\r\nus. \"They have some kind of alabaster, marble, cement, etc., but these\r\nsubstances are as different from ours as the web of a spider is\r\ndifferent from our linen.\"\r\n\r\nThese inhabitants of the elements, or \"nature-spirits,\" may, or may not\r\nbe, conscious of the existence of man; oftentimes feeling him merely as\r\na force which propels, or arrests them; for by his will and by his\r\nthought, he acts upon the astral currents of the aerial world in which\r\nthey live; and by the use of his hands he sways the material elements of\r\nearth, fire, and water wherein they are established. They perceive the\r\nsoul-essence of man with its \"currents and forms,\" and they also are\r\ncapable of reading such thoughts as do not spiritually transcend their\r\npowers of discernment. They perceive the states of feeling and emotions\r\nof men by the \"_colors_ and impressions produced in their auras,\" and\r\nmay thus irresistibly be drawn into overt action upon man's plane of\r\nlife. They are the invisible _stone-throwers_ we hear of so frequently,\r\nsupposed to be _human_ spirits; the perpetrators of mischief, such as\r\ndestruction of property in the habitations of men, noises, and\r\nmysterious nocturnal annoyances.\r\n\r\nOf all writers upon occult subjects to whose works we have as yet gained\r\naccess, Paracelsus throws the greatest light upon these tricky sprites\r\ncelebrated in the realm of poesy, and inhabiting that disputed land\r\npopularly termed fairydom. From open vision, and that wonderful insight\r\nof the master or adept into the secrets of nature, Paracelsus is able to\r\ngive us the most positive information concerning their bodily formation,\r\nthe nature of their existence, and other extraordinary particulars,\r\nwhich proves that he has actually seen and observed them, and doubtless\r\nalso employed them as the obedient servants of his purified will; a\r\npower into which the spiritual man ascends by a species of right, when\r\nhe has thrown off, or conquered, the thraldom of matter in his own body,\r\nand stands open-eyed at \"the portals of his deep within.\"\r\n\r\nWe will quote certain extracts from the pages of this wonderful\r\ninterpreter of nature. \"There are two kinds of flesh. One that comes\r\nfrom Adam, and another that does not come from Adam. The former is gross\r\nmaterial, visible and tangible for us; the other one is not tangible and\r\nnot made from earth. If a man who is a descendant from Adam wants to\r\npass through a wall, he will have first to make a hole through it; but a\r\nbeing who is not descended from Adam needs no hole nor door, but may\r\npass through matter that appears solid to us without causing any damage\r\nto it. The beings not descended from Adam, as well as those descended\r\nfrom him, are organized and have substantial bodies; but there is as\r\nmuch difference between the substance composing their bodies as there is\r\nbetween matter and spirit. Yet the elementals are not spirits, because\r\nthey have flesh, blood, and bones; they live and propagate offspring;\r\nthey eat and talk, act and sleep, etc., and consequently they cannot be\r\nproperly called spirits. They are beings occupying a place between man\r\nand spirits, resembling men and women in their organization and form,\r\nand resembling spirits in the rapidity of their locomotion. They are\r\nintermediary beings or composita, formed out of two parts joined into\r\none; just as two colors mixed together will appear as one color,\r\nresembling neither one nor the other of the two original ones. The\r\nelementals have no higher principles; they are therefore not immortal,\r\nand when they die they perish like animals. Neither water nor fire can\r\ninjure them, and they cannot be locked up in our material prisons. They\r\nare, however, subject to diseases. Their costumes, actions, forms, ways\r\nof speaking, etc., are not very unlike those of human beings; but there\r\nare a great many varieties. They have only animal intellects, and are\r\nincapable of spiritual development.\"\r\n\r\nIn saying the elementals have \"no higher principles,\" and \"When they die\r\nthey perish like animals,\" Paracelsus does not stop to explain that the\r\nhigher principles in them are absolutely latent, as in plants; and that\r\nanimals in \"perishing\" are not destroyed, but the psychical or soul-part\r\nof the animal passes, by the processes of evolution, into higher forms.\r\n\r\n\"Each species moves only in the element to which it belongs, and neither\r\nof them can go out of its appropriate element, which is to them as the\r\nair is to us, or the water to fishes; and none of them can live in the\r\nelement belonging to another class. To each elemental being the element\r\nin which it lives is transparent, invisible, and respirable, as the\r\natmosphere is to ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as the personalities of the elementals are concerned, it may be\r\nsaid that those belonging to the element of water resemble human beings\r\nof either sex; those of the air are greater and stronger; the\r\nsalamanders are long, lean, and dry; the pigmies (gnomes) are the length\r\nof about two spans, but they may extend or elongate their forms until\r\nthey appear like giants.\r\n\r\n\"Nymphs (undines, or naiads) have their residences and palaces in the\r\nelement of water; sylphs and salamanders have no fixed dwellings.\r\nSalamanders have been seen in the shape of fiery balls, or tongues of\r\nfire running over the fields or appearing in houses;\" or at psychical\r\nseances as starry lights, darting and dancing about.\r\n\r\n\"There are certain localities where large numbers of elementals live\r\ntogether, and it has occurred that a man has been admitted into their\r\ncommunities and lived with them for a while, and that they have become\r\nvisible and tangible to him.\"\r\n\r\nPoets, in their moments of exaltation, have an unconscious soul-vision\r\nbefore which nature's invisible worlds lie like an open volume, and they\r\ntranslate her secrets into language of mystic meanings whose harmonies\r\nare re-interpreted by sympathetic minds. The poet Hogg, in his _Rapture\r\nof Kilmeny_, would seem to have had a vision of some such visit as that\r\ndescribed above, into the fairyland of pure, peaceful _elementals_.\r\n\r\n\"Bonny Kilmeny gaed up the glen\"--and is represented as having fallen\r\nasleep. During this sleep she is transported to \"a far countrye,\" whose\r\ngentle, lovely inhabitants receive her with delight. The following\r\nlines reveal the poet's power of inner vision, as will be seen by the\r\nwords italicized. They are in wonderful accord with the descriptions\r\ngiven by Paracelsus from the actual observation of a _conscious seer_:\r\n\r\n    \"They lifted Kilmeny, they led her away,\r\n    And she walk'd _in the light of a sunless day_;\r\n    The sky was _a dome of crystal bright_,\r\n    The _fountain of vision and fountain of light_;\r\n    The emerald fields _were of dazzling glow_,\r\n    And the _flowers of everlasting blow_.\"\r\n\r\nIt needs but a brushing away of the films of flesh, which occurs in\r\nmoments of rapt inspiration, for the soul, escaping from its\r\nprison-house, to revel in the innocent, peaceful scenes of its own inner\r\nworld, and give a true description of what it beholds. The inner\r\nmeanings of things, the symbolical correspondences are revealed in a\r\nflash of light, and the poet-soul becomes revelator and prophet all in\r\none. He sets it down to imagination and fancy, when he returns into his\r\nnormal state, and it is what we call \"a flight of genius\"--the power of\r\nthe soul to enter its own appropriate world. Certainly _les ames de\r\nboue_ have no such power. It is, however, a _proof that world exists_,\r\nif we will but understand it aright.\r\n\r\nThere has never existed a poet with a truer conception of \"elemental\"\r\nlife than Shakespeare. What more exquisite creation of the poet's fancy,\r\nwhich _might be every word of it true_, for in no particular does it\r\nsurpass the truth, than that of _Ariel_, whom the \"foul witch Sycorax,\"\r\n\"by help of her more potent ministers, and in her most unmitigable\r\nrage,\" did confine \"into a cloven pine;\" for Ariel, the good elemental,\r\nwas \"a spirit too delicate to act her earthly and abhorred commands.\"\r\nWhen Prospero, the Adept and White Magician, arrived upon the scene, by\r\nhis superior art he liberated the delicate Ariel, who afterwards becomes\r\nhis ministering servant for _good_, not for evil.\r\n\r\nIn the _Midsummer Night's Dream_, Titania transports a human child into\r\nher elemental world, where she keeps him with so jealous a love as to\r\nrefuse to yield him even to her \"fairy lord,\" as Puck calls him. Puck\r\nhimself is almost as exquisite a realization of elemental life as Ariel.\r\nAs Shakespeare unfolds the lovely, innocent tale of the occupations,\r\nsports and pranks of this aerial people, he introduces us to the\r\nelementals of his own beautiful thought world; and, although indulging\r\nin the \"sports of fancy,\" there is so broad a foundation of truth, that,\r\nbeing enlightened by the revelations of Paracelsus, we no longer think\r\nwe are merely entertained by the poetical inventions of a master of his\r\nart, but may well believe we have been witnesses of a charming reality\r\nbeheld through the \"rift in the veil\" of the poet's unconscious inner\r\nsight. Indeed, one of the tenets of occult science is that there is\r\nnothing on earth, nor that the mind of man can conceive, which is not\r\nalready existent in the unseen world.\r\n\r\nWe reflect in the translucence, or _diaphane_ of our mental world those\r\nconcrete images of things which we attract by the irresistible magnetism\r\nof _desire_ working through the thought. It is a spontaneous,\r\nunconscious mental process with us; but there is no reason why it should\r\nnot become a perfectly conscious process regulated by a divine wisdom\r\nto functions of harmony with nature's laws, and to productions of beauty\r\nand beneficence for the good of the whole world. As the world is the\r\nconcreted emanation of divine thought, so it is by thought that man, the\r\nmicrocosm, _creates_ upon his petty, finite plane. Given the\r\ndesire--even if it be only as the lightest breath of a summer zephyr\r\nupon the sleeping bosom of the ocean, scarcely ruffling its surface--it\r\nbecomes a center of attraction for suitable molecules of\r\nthought-substance floating in space, which immediately \"agglomerate\r\nround the idea proceeding to reveal itself,\" _by means_ of clothing\r\nitself in substance. By these silent processes in the invisible world\r\nwherein our souls draw the breath of life, we form our mental world, our\r\npersonal character, even our very physical bodies. The _perisprit_, or\r\nastral body, the vehicle for _formless spirit_, is essentially builded\r\nup from the mental life, and grows by the accretion of those atoms or\r\nmolecules of thought-substance which are assimilable by the mind. Hence\r\na good man, a man of lofty aspirations, forms, as the _nearest_ external\r\nclothing of his inner spirit, a beautiful soul-body, which irradiates\r\nthrough and beautifies the physical body. The man of low and groveling\r\nmind will, on the contrary, attract the depraved and poisoned substances\r\nof the lower astral world; the malarial emanations thrown off by other\r\nequally depraved beings, by which his mind becomes embruted, his soul\r\ndiseased, whilst his physical form presents in a concrete image the\r\nugliness of his inner nature. Such a man never ascends above the dense,\r\nmephitic vapors of the sin-laden world, nor takes into his soul the\r\nslightest breath of pure, vitalizing air. He is diseased by invisible\r\nastral _microbes_, being most effectually self-inoculated with them by\r\nthe operation of desires which never transcend the earth. Did we lift\r\nthe veil which shrouds from mortal sight the elemental world of such a\r\nmoral pervert, we should behold a world teeming with hideous forms, and\r\nas actively working as the _bacteria_ of fermentation revealed by a\r\npowerful microscope, elementals of destruction, death, and decay, which\r\nmust pass out into other forms for the purification of the spiritual\r\natmosphere; creatures produced by the man's own thoughts, living upon\r\nand in him, and reflecting, like mirrors, his hideousness back again to\r\nhimself. It is from the presence of innumerable foci of evil of this\r\nkind that the world is befouled, and the moral atmosphere of our planet\r\ntainted. They emit poisoned astral currents, from which none are safe\r\nbut those who are in the _positive_ condition of perfect moral health.\r\n\r\nFrom the fountain of life we draw in the materials of life, and become,\r\nupon our lower plane, other living fountains, which from liberty of\r\nchoice, and freedom of will, have the power of so muddying the pure\r\nstream, that in its turbidness and foulness it becomes death\r\ninstead of life, and produces hell instead of heaven. When we, by\r\nself-purification, and that constant mental discipline which trains us\r\nupwards, clinging to our highest ideal by the tendrils of faith, and\r\nlove, and continual aspiration, as the vine would cling to a rock--have\r\neliminated all that is impure in our thought world, we become fountains\r\nof life, and make our own heavens, wherein are reflected only images of\r\ndivine beauty. The whole elemental world on our immediate astral plane\r\nbecomes gradually transformed during the progress of our evolution into\r\nthe higher spiritual grades of being. And as humanity _en masse_\r\nadvances, throwing off the moral and spiritual deformity of the selfish,\r\nignorant ego, the astral atmospheres belonging to our planet world\r\nbecome filled with elementals of a peaceful, loving character, of\r\nbeautiful forms, and of beneficent influences. The currents of evil\r\nforce which now act with a continually jarring effect upon those\r\nstriving to maintain the equilibrium of harmony with nature upon the\r\nside of _good_, would cease. That depression, agitation, and distress\r\nwhich now, from inscrutable causes, assail minds otherwise rejoicing in\r\nan innocent happiness, forewarning them of some impending calamity, or\r\nof some evil presence it seems impossible to shake off, would become\r\nunknown. The horrible demons of war, with which humanity, in its sinful\r\nstate of _separateness_, is continually threatening itself--as if the\r\nmembers of one body were self-opposed, and revolting from that state of\r\nagreement that can alone ensure the well-being of the whole--would no\r\nlonger be held, like ravenous bloodhounds chafing against their leashes,\r\nready to spring, at a word, upon their hellish work; but they will have\r\npassed away, like other hideous deformities of evil; and the serene\r\nastral atmospheres would no longer reflect ideas of cruel wrongs to\r\nfellow-beings, revenge, lust of power, injustice, and ruthless hatred.\r\nWe are taught that around an \"idea\" agglomerate the suitable molecules\r\nof soul-substance--\"Monads,\" as Leibnitz terms them, until a concrete\r\nform stands created, the production of a mind, or minds. All the hideous\r\nman-created beings, powers or forces, which now act like ravaging\r\npestilences and storms in the astral atmospheres of our planet will\r\nhave disappeared like the monstrous phantoms of a frightful dream, when\r\nthe whole of humanity has progressed into a state of higher spiritual\r\nevolution. It is well to reflect that _each individual_, however humble\r\nand apparently insignificant his position in the great human family, can\r\naid by his life, by the silent emanation of his pure and wise thoughts,\r\nas well as by his active labors for humanity, in bringing nearer this\r\nhalcyon period of peace, harmony, and purity--that millennium, in short,\r\nwe are all looking forward to, as a dream we can never hope to see\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nIn _Man: Fragments of Forgotten History_, we read: \"Violence was the\r\nmost baneful manifestation of man's spiritual decadence, and it\r\nrebounded upon him from the elemental beings, whom it was his duty to\r\ndevelop\"--those _sub-mundanes_, towards whom man is now learning that he\r\nincurs _responsibilities_ of which he is at present utterly unconscious,\r\nbut of which he will indubitably become more and more aware as he\r\nascends the ladder of spiritual evolution.\r\n\r\nTo continue our extract from _Fragments_. \"When this duty was ignored,\r\nand the separation of interests was accentuated, the natural man\r\nforcibly realized an antagonism with the elemental spirits. As violence\r\nincreased in man, these spirits waxed strong in their way, and, true to\r\ntheir natures, which had been outraged by the neglect of those who were\r\nin a sense their guardians, they automatically responded with\r\nresentment. No longer could man rely upon the power of love or harmony\r\nto guide others, because he himself had ceased to be impelled solely by\r\nits influence; distrust had marred the symmetry of his inner self, and\r\nbeings who could not perceive but only _receive impressions projected\r\ntowards them_, quickly adapted themselves to the altered conditions.\"\r\n(Elementals as _forces_, respond to forces, or are swayed by them; man,\r\nas a superior force, acts upon them, therefore, injuriously, or\r\nbeneficially, and they in their turn, poisoned by his baleful influence,\r\nwhen he is depraved, become injurious forces to him by the laws of\r\nreaction.) \"At once nature itself took on the changed expression; and\r\nwhere all before was gladness and freshness there were now indications\r\nof sorrow and decay. Atmospheric influences hitherto unrecognized began\r\nto be noted; there was felt a chill in the morning, a dearth of magnetic\r\nheat at noon-tide, and a universal deadness at the approach of night,\r\nwhich began to be looked upon with alarm. For a change in the object\r\nmust accompany every change in the subject. Until this point was reached\r\nthere was nothing to make man afraid of himself and his surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"And as he plunged deeper and deeper into matter, he lost his\r\nconsciousness of the subtler forms of existence, and attributed all the\r\nantagonism he experienced to unknown causes. The conflict continued to\r\nwax stronger, and, in consequence of his ignorance, man fell a readier\r\nvictim. There were exceptions among the race then, as there are now,\r\nwhose finer perceptive faculties outgrew, or kept ahead, of the\r\nadvancing materialization; and they alone, in course of events, could\r\nfeel and recognize the influences of these earliest progeny of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"Time came when an occasional appearance was viewed with alarm, and was\r\nthought to be an omen of evil. Recognizing this fear on the part of man,\r\nthe elementals ultimately came to realize for him the dangers he\r\napprehended, and they banded together to terrify him.\" (They reflected\r\nback to him his own fears in a concrete form, sufficiently intelligent,\r\nperhaps, to take some malicious pleasure in it, for man in propelling\r\ninto space a force of any kind is met by a reactionary force, which\r\nseems to give exactly what his mind foreshadowed. In the negative\r\ncoldness of fear, he lays himself open to infesting molecules or atoms\r\nwhich paralyze life, and he falls a victim to his own lack of faith,\r\ncheerful courage and hope.) \"They found strong allies in an order of\r\nexistence which was generated when physical death made its appearance\"\r\n(_i.e._, elementaries, or shells); \"and their combined forces began to\r\nmanifest themselves at night, for which man had a dread as being the\r\nenemy of his protector, the sun.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Fragments of Forgotten History._]\r\n\r\n\"The elementaries galvanized into activity by the elemental beings began\r\nto appear to man under as many varieties of shape as his hopes and fears\r\nallowed. And as his ignorance of things spiritual became denser, these\r\nagencies brought in an influx of error, which accelerated his spiritual\r\ndegeneration. Thus, it will be seen that man's neglect of his duty to\r\nthe nature-spirits is the cause which has launched him into a sea of\r\ntroubles, that has shipwrecked so many generations of his descendants.\r\nFamines, plagues, wars, and other catastrophes are not so disconnected\r\nwith the agency of nature-spirits as it might appear to the sceptical\r\nmind.\"[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Fragments of Forgotten History._]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that the world of man exercises a controlling\r\npower over this invisible world of elementals. Even in the most remote\r\nand inaccessible haunts of nature, where we may imagine halcyon days of\r\nan innocent bliss elapsing in poetic peace and beauty for the more\r\nharmless of these irresponsible, evanescent offspring of nature's\r\nteeming bosom, they must inevitably, sooner or later, yield up their\r\npeaceful sovereignty to the greater monarch, man, who usually comes with\r\na harsh and discordant influence, like the burning sirocco of the\r\ndesert, like the overwhelming avalanche from the silent peaks of snow,\r\nor the earthquake, convulsing and tearing to atoms the beauty of\r\ngardens, palaces, cities. It is said that elementals _die_; it is\r\npresumable that at such times they die by myriads, when the whole\r\nsurface of the earth becomes changed from the unavoidable passing away\r\nof nature's wildernesses, the peaceful homes of bird and beast, as the\r\nimproving, commercial, money-grasping man--that contradiction of God,\r\nthat industrious destroyer, who lives at war with beauty, peace, and\r\ngoodness--appears upon the scene. These may be called poetical\r\nrhapsodies; yet poetry is, in a mysterious way, closely allied to that\r\nhidden truth which has its birth on the soul-plane, and the imagination\r\nof man is, according to Eliphas Levi, a clairvoyant and magical\r\nfaculty--\"the wand of the magician.\"\r\n\r\nTo speak of elementals _dying_, is to use a word which expresses for us\r\n_change of condition_; the passing from one sphere of life to another,\r\nor from one plane of consciousness to another. This to the sensual man\r\nis \"death.\" But there is _no_ death--it is merely a passing from one\r\nphase of existence to another. Hence the elementals lose the forms they\r\nonce held, changing their plane of consciousness, and appearing in other\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nWe have shown somewhat of the mysterious way in which man acts upon\r\nthese invisible denizens of his soul-world, and by which he incurs a\r\ncertain responsibility. By the dynamic power of thought and will it is\r\ndone--as everything is done. The elementals pushed by man, as by a\r\nsuperior force, off that equilibrium of harmony with pure, innocent\r\nnature, which they originally maintained when our planet was young, have\r\nbeen transformed into powers of evil, which man brings upon himself as\r\nretribution--the reaction of that force he ignorantly sets in motion\r\nwhen he breaks the beneficent laws of nature. Originally dependent upon\r\nhim, and capable of aiding him in a thousand ways when he is wise and\r\ngood, they have become his enemies, who thwart him at every turn, and\r\nguard the secrets of their abodes with none the less implacable\r\nsternness because they are probably only semi-conscious of the functions\r\nthey perform. It is nature acting through them--the great cosmic\r\nconsciousness, which forbids that desecrating footsteps shall invade the\r\nholy precincts of her stupendous life-secrets. But to the spiritual\r\nman--the god--these secrets open of themselves, like a hand laden with\r\ngifts, readily unclosing to a favorite and deserving child.\r\n\r\nGiving forth a current of evil, and sinking therefrom into a state of\r\nbestial ignorance, man has enveloped himself in clouds of darkness which\r\nassume monstrous shapes threatening to overwhelm him. A wicked man is\r\ngenerally a coward because he lives in a state of perpetual dread of the\r\nreactionary effect of the evil forces he has set in motion. These are\r\nvolumes of elemental forms banded together, and swaying like the\r\nthunder-clouds of a gathering storm.\r\n\r\nTo disperse these, his own spiritual mind must ray forth the light\r\nreflected from the source of light--omniscience. In the astral\r\natmospheres of the spiritual man, there are no clouds, and fear is\r\nunknown. In the mental world of the innocent and pure, those are only\r\nforms of gracious beauty, as lovely as the shapes of nature's innocent\r\nembryons, which reveal themselves in the forests, the running streams,\r\nthe floating breeze, and in company with the birds and flowers, to the\r\nclairvoyant sight of those nature-lovers before whom she withdraws her\r\nveils, communing with their souls by an intuitional speech which fills\r\nthem with rapturous admiration. It is not only the learned scientist who\r\nmay read nature's marvelous revelations; for she whispers them with\r\nmaternal tenderness into the open ears of babes, where they remain ever\r\nsafe from desecration, and are cherished as the soul's innocent delights\r\nin hours of isolation from the busy, jarring world.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual soul is ever looking beneath nature's material veils for\r\n_correspondences_. Every natural object _means_ something else to such\r\npenetrating vision--a vision which begins to be spontaneously exercised\r\nby the soul when it has fairly reached that stage of spiritual\r\nevolution; and to this silent exploration many a secret meaning reveals\r\nitself by object-pictures, which awaken reflection and inquiry as to the\r\nwhy and wherefore. Thus the spiritual man drinks, as it were, from\r\nnature's own hand the pure waters of an inexhaustible spring--that\r\noccult knowledge which feeds his soul, and aids in forming for him a\r\nbeautiful and powerful astral body. And nature becomes invested to his\r\npenetrating sight with a beauty she never wore before, and which the\r\nclay-blinded eyes of animal man can never behold. Such a man would enter\r\nthe isolated haunts of the purer nature-spirits with gentle footsteps,\r\nand loving thoughts. To him the breeze is wafted wooingly, the streams\r\nwhisper music, and everything wears an aspect of loving joyousness, and\r\ninviting confidence. Beside the rigid material forms, he sees their\r\n_aromal counter-parts_; everything is life; the very stones live, and\r\nhave a consciousness suited to their state; and he feels as if every\r\natom of his own body vibrated in unison with the living things about\r\nhim--as if _all were one flesh_. To injure a single thing would be\r\nimpossible to him. Such is the soul-condition of the perfect man, to\r\nwhom evil has become impossible.\r\n\r\nAn adept has written--\"Every thought of man upon being evolved passes\r\ninto another world and becomes an active entity by associating\r\nitself--coalescing, we might term it--with an elemental; that is to say,\r\nwith one of the semi-intelligent forces of the kingdoms. It survives as\r\nan active intelligence--a creature of the mind's begetting--for a longer\r\nor shorter period, proportionate with the original intensity of the\r\ncerebral action which generated it. Thus, a good thought is perpetuated\r\nas an active, beneficent power, an evil one as a maleficent demon. And\r\nso man is continually peopling his current in space with the offspring\r\nof his fancies, desires, impulses, and passions; a current which\r\nre-acts upon any sensitive or nervous organization which comes in\r\ncontact with it, in proportion to its dynamic intensity. The adept\r\nevolves these shapes consciously, other men throw them off\r\nunconsciously.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, man must be held responsible not only for his outward\r\nactions, but his secret thoughts, by which he puts into existence\r\nirresponsible entities of more or less maleficent power, if his thoughts\r\nbe of an evil nature. These are revelations of a deep and abstruse\r\ncharacter; but would they have come at all if man had not reached that\r\nstage of evolution when it is necessary he should step up into his\r\nspiritual kingdom, and rule as a master over his lower self, and as a\r\nbeneficent god over every department of unintelligent nature?\r\n\r\nWe note the closing words of the adept's letter: \"The adept evolves\r\nthese shapes consciously, other men throw them off unconsciously.\" In\r\nthe adept's soul-world then--the man who has ascended, by self-conquest\r\nprimarily, into his spiritual kingdom, and who has graduated through\r\nyears of probation and study in spiritual or occult science--_i.e._, the\r\nWhite Magician, the Son of God, the inheritor by spiritual evolution, of\r\ndivinity--there would reign peace, happiness, beauty, order, absolute\r\nharmony with nature on the side of good. No discordant note, no deformed\r\nastral production to embarrass or obstruct the current of divine\r\nmagnetism he emanates into space--the delicious, soul-purifying,\r\nhealing, and uplifting aura which radiates from him as from a center of\r\nbeneficence to the lower world of struggling humanity. The\r\nsemi-intelligent forces of nature, the innocent nature spirits would in\r\nsuch a soul-world, find an appropriate and harmonious habitat,\r\nclustering in waiting obedience upon the behests of a master whose every\r\nthought-breath would be as an uplifting life.\r\n\r\nTo such a state and condition of complete harmony with God and nature\r\nmust the truly perfect spiritual man ascend by evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELEMENTALS AND ELEMENTARIES\r\n\r\nFrom the similarity of the terms used to designate two classes of astral\r\nbeings who are able to communicate with man, a certain confusion has\r\narisen in the public mind, which it would be as well, perhaps, to aid in\r\nremoving.\r\n\r\n_Elementals_ is a term applied to the nature spirits, the living\r\nexistences which belong peculiarly to the elements they inhabit; \"beings\r\nof the _mysteria specialia_,\" according to Paracelsus, \"soul-forms,\r\nwhich will return into their chaos, and who are not capable of\r\nmanifesting any higher spiritual activity because they do not possess\r\nthe necessary kind of constitution in which an activity of a spiritual\r\ncharacter can manifest itself.... Matter is connected with spirit by an\r\nintermediate principle which it receives from this spirit. This\r\nintermediate link between matter and spirit belongs to all the three\r\nkingdoms of nature. In the mineral kingdom it is called Stannar, or\r\nTrughat; in the vegetable kingdom, Jaffas; and it forms in connection\r\nwith the vital force of the vegetable kingdom, the Primum Ens, which\r\npossesses the highest medicinal properties.... In the animal kingdom,\r\nthis semi-material body is called Evestrum, and in human beings it is\r\ncalled the Sidereal Man. Each living being is connected with the\r\nMacrocosmos and Microcosmos by means of this intermediate element of\r\nsoul, belonging to the Mysterium Magnum from whence it has been\r\nreceived, and whose form and qualities are determined by the quality and\r\nquantity of the spiritual and material elements.\" From this we may infer\r\nthat the _Elementals_, properly speaking, are the _Soul-forms_ of the\r\nelements they inhabit--the activities and energies of the _world-soul_\r\ndifferentiated into forms, endowed with more or less consciousness and\r\ncapacities for feeling, and hours of enjoyment, or pain. But these,\r\nnever or rarely, entering any more deeply into dense matter than enabled\r\nso to do by their aerial invisible bodies, do not appear upon our gross\r\nphysical plane otherwise than as forces, energies, or influences. Their\r\nsoul-forms are the intermediate link between matter and spirit,\r\nresembling the soul-forms of animals and men, which also form this\r\nintermediate link, the difference being that the souls of animals and\r\nmen have enveloped themselves in a casing of dense matter for the\r\npurposes of existence upon the more external planes of life.\r\nConsequently, after the death of the external bodies of men and animals,\r\nthere remain astral remnants which undergo gradual disintegration in the\r\nastral atmospheres. These have been termed _elementaries_; _i.e._, \"the\r\nastral corpses of the dead; the ethereal counterpart of the once living\r\nperson, which will sooner or later be decomposed into its astral\r\nelements, as the physical body is dissolved into the elements to which\r\nit belongs. The elementaries of good people have little cohesion and\r\nevaporate soon; those of wicked people may exist a long time; those of\r\nsuicides, etc., have a life and consciousness of their own as long as a\r\ndivision of principles has not taken place. These are the most\r\ndangerous.\"\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to _Isis Unveiled_, we find the following definition\r\nof elemental spirits:\r\n\r\n\"The creatures evolved in the four kingdoms of earth, air, fire, and\r\nwater, and called by the Kabalists gnomes, sylphs, salamanders, and\r\nundines. They may be termed the forces of nature, and will either\r\noperate effects as the servile agents of general law, or may be employed\r\nby the disembodied spirits--whether pure or impure--and by living adepts\r\nof magic and sorcery, to produce desired phenomenal results. _Such_\r\nbeings never become men.\" (But there are classes of elemental spirits\r\nwho do become men, as we shall see further on.)\r\n\r\n\"Under the general designation of fairies and fays, these spirits of the\r\nelements appear in the myth, fable, tradition, and poetry of all\r\nnations, ancient and modern. Their names are legion--peris, devs, djins,\r\nsylvans, satyrs, fawns, elves, dwarfs, trolls, kobolds, brownies,\r\nstromkarls, undines, nixies, salamanders, goblins, banshees, kelpies,\r\nprixies, moss people, good people, good neighbors, wild women, men of\r\npeace, white ladies, and many more. They have been seen, feared,\r\nblessed, banned, and invoked in every quarter of the globe and in every\r\nage. These elementals are the principal agents of disembodied but never\r\nvisible spirits at seances, and the producers of all the phenomena\r\nexcept the 'subjective.'\"--(Preface xxix, vol. I.)\r\n\r\n\"In the Jewish Kabala the nature spirits were known under the general\r\nname of _Shedim_, and divided into four classes. The Persians called\r\nthem _devs_; the Greeks indistinctly designated them as _demons_; the\r\nEgyptians knew them as _afrites_. The ancient Mexicans, says Kaiser,\r\nbelieved in numerous spirit-abodes, into one of which the shades of\r\ninnocent children were placed until final disposal; into another,\r\nsituated in the sun, ascended the valiant souls of heroes; while the\r\nhideous specters of incorrigible sinners were sentenced to wander and\r\ndespair in subterranean caves, held in the bonds of the\r\nearth-atmosphere, unwilling and unable to liberate themselves. They\r\npassed their time in communicating with mortals, and frightening those\r\nwho could see them. Some of the African tribes know them as\r\nYowahoos.\"--(P. 313, vol. I.)\r\n\r\nOf the ideas of Proclus on this subject it is said in _Isis Unveiled_:\r\n\r\n\"He held that the four elements are all filled with demons, maintaining\r\nwith Aristotle that the universe is full, and that there is no void in\r\nnature. The demons of earth, air, fire, and water, are of an elastic,\r\nethereal, semi-corporeal essence. It is these classes which officiate as\r\nintermediate agents between the gods and men. Although lower in\r\nintelligence than the sixth order of the higher demons, these beings\r\npreside directly over the elements and organic life. They direct the\r\ngrowth, the inflorescence, the properties, and various changes of\r\nplants. They are the personified ideas or virtues shed from the heavenly\r\n_ule_ into the inorganic matter; and, as the vegetable kingdom is one\r\nremove higher than the mineral, these emanations from the celestial gods\r\ntake form in the plant, and become _its soul_. It is that which\r\nAristotle's doctrine terms the _form_ in the three principles of natural\r\nbodies, classified by him as _privation_, matter, and form. His\r\nphilosophy teaches that besides the original matter, another principle\r\nis necessary to complete the triune nature of every particle, and this\r\nis _form_; an invisible, but still, in an ontological sense of the word,\r\na substantial being, really distinct from matter proper. Thus, in an\r\nanimal or a plant, besides the bones, the flesh, the nerves, the brains,\r\nand the blood in the former; and besides the pulpy matter, tissues,\r\nfibers, and juice in the latter, which blood and juice by circulating\r\nthrough the veins and fibers nourish all parts of both animal and plant;\r\nand besides the animal spirits which are the principles of motion, and\r\nthe chemical energy which is transformed into vital force in the green\r\nleaf, there must be a substantial form, which Aristotle called in the\r\nhorse, the _horse's soul_; and Proclus, the _demon_ of every mineral,\r\nplant, or animal, and the medieval philosophers, the _elementary\r\nspirits_ of the four kingdoms.\"--(P. 312, vol. I.)\r\n\r\n\"According to the ancient doctrines, the soulless elemental spirits were\r\nevolved by the ceaseless motion inherent in the astral light. Light is\r\nforce, and the latter is produced by _will_. As this will proceeds from\r\nan intelligence which cannot err, for it has nothing of the material\r\norgans of human thought in it, being the super-fine pure emanation of\r\nthe highest divinity itself--(Plato's _Father_)--it proceeds from the\r\nbeginning of time, according to immutable laws, to evolve the\r\nelementary fabric requisite for subsequent generations of what we term\r\nhuman races. All of the latter, whether belonging to this planet or to\r\nsome other of the myriads in space, have their earthly bodies evolved in\r\nthe matrix out of the bodies of a certain class of these elemental\r\nbeings which have passed away in the invisible worlds.\" (P. 285, vol.\r\nI.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Pythagoras, Iamblichus, and other Greek philosophers, _Isis_\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The universal ether was not, in their eyes, simply a something\r\nstretching, tenantless, throughout the expanse of heaven; it was a\r\nboundless ocean peopled, like our familiar seas, with monstrous and\r\nminor creatures, and having in its every molecule the germs of life.\r\nLike the finny tribes which swarm in our oceans and smaller bodies of\r\nwater, each kind having its 'habitat' in some spot to which it is\r\ncuriously adapted; some friendly and some inimical to man; some pleasant\r\nand some frightful to behold; some seeking the refuge of quiet nooks and\r\nland-locked harbors, and some traversing great areas of water, the\r\nvarious races of the elemental spirits were believed by them to inhabit\r\nthe different portions of the great ethereal ocean, and to be exactly\r\nadapted to their respective conditions.\" (P. 284, vol. I.)\r\n\r\n\"Lowest in the scale of being are those invisible creatures called by\r\nthe Kabalists the _elementary_. There are three distinct classes of\r\nthese. The highest, in intelligence and cunning, are the so-called\r\nterrestrial spirits, the _larvae_, or shadows of those who have lived on\r\nearth, have refused all spiritual light, remained and died deeply\r\nimmersed in the mire of matter, and from whose sinful souls the\r\nimmortal spirit has gradually separated. The second class is composed of\r\ninvisible antitypes of men _to be_ born. No form can come into objective\r\nexistence, from the highest to the lowest, before the abstract idea of\r\nthis form, or as Aristotle would call it, the privation of this form is\r\ncalled forth.... These models, as yet devoid of immortal spirits, are\r\nelementals properly speaking, _psychic embryos_--which when their time\r\narrives, die out of the invisible world, and are borne into this visible\r\none as human infants, receiving _in transitu_ that divine breath called\r\nspirit which completes the perfect man. This class cannot communicate\r\nobjectively with man.\r\n\r\n\"The third class of elementals proper never evolve into human beings,\r\nbut occupy, as it were, a specific step of the ladder of being, and, by\r\ncomparison with the others, may properly be called nature-spirits, or\r\ncosmic agents of nature, each being confined to its own element, and\r\nnever transgressing the bounds of others. These are what Tertullian\r\ncalled 'the princes of the powers of the air.'\r\n\r\n\"This class is believed to possess but one of the three attributes of\r\nman. They have neither immortal souls nor tangible bodies; only astral\r\nforms, which partake, in a distinguishing degree, of the element to\r\nwhich they belong, and also of the ether. They are a combination of\r\nsublimated matter and a rudimental mind. Some are changeless, but still\r\nhave no separate individuality, acting collectively so to say. Others,\r\nof certain elements and species, change form under a fixed law which\r\nKabalists explain. The most solid of their bodies is ordinarily just\r\nimmaterial enough to escape perception by our physical eyesight, but\r\nnot so unsubstantial but that they can be perfectly recognized by the\r\ninner or clairvoyant vision. They not only exist, and can all live in\r\nether, but can handle and direct it for the production of physical\r\neffects, as readily as we can compress air or water for the same purpose\r\nby pneumatic or hydraulic apparatus; in which occupation they are\r\nreadily helped by the 'human elementary.' More than this; they can so\r\ncondense it as to make to themselves tangible bodies, which by their\r\nprotean powers they can cause to assume such likenesses as they choose,\r\nby taking as their models the portraits they find stamped in the memory\r\nof the persons present. It is not necessary that the sitter should be\r\nthinking at the moment of the one represented. His image may have faded\r\naway years before. The mind receives indelible impression even from\r\nchance acquaintance, or persons encountered but once.\" (Pp. 310, 311,\r\nvol. I.)\r\n\r\n\"If spiritualists are anxious to keep strictly dogmatic in their notions\r\nof the spirit-world, they must not set _scientists_ to investigate their\r\nphenomena in the true experimental spirit. The attempt would most surely\r\nresult in a partial re-discovery of the magic of old--that of Moses and\r\nParacelsus. Under the deceptive beauty of some of their apparitions,\r\nthey might find some day the sylphs and fair undines of the Rosicrucians\r\nplaying in the currents of _psychic_ and _odic_ force.\r\n\r\n\"Already Mr. Crookes, who fully credits the _being_, feels that under\r\nthe fair skin of Katie, covering a simulacrum of heart borrowed\r\npartially from the medium and the circle, there is no soul! And the\r\nlearned authors of the _Unseen Universe_, abandoning their\r\n\"electro-biological\" theory, begin to perceive in the universal ether\r\nthe _possibility_ that it is a photographic album of _En-Soph_ the\r\nBoundless.--(P. 67, vol. I.)\r\n\r\n\"We are far from believing that all the spirits that communicate at\r\ncircles are of the classes called 'elemental' and 'elementary.'\" Many,\r\nespecially among those who control the medium subjectively to speak,\r\nwrite, and otherwise act in various ways, are human, disembodied\r\nspirits. Whether the majority of such spirits are good or _bad_, largely\r\ndepends on the private morality of the medium, much on the circle\r\npresent, and a great deal on the intensity and object of their\r\npurpose.... But in any case, human spirits can _never_ materialize\r\nthemselves in _propria persona_.[21]--(P. 67, vol. I.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: By which it is doubtless meant that the _full_\r\nindividuality is not present; the higher principles, the _true_ spirit,\r\nhaving ascended to its appropriate house, from which there is no\r\nattraction to earth. That which materializes would be an elemental, or\r\nelementals molding their fluidic forms in the likeness of the departed\r\nhuman being; or, on the other hand, considering and revivifying the\r\natomic remnants of the sidereal encasement, or astral body, still left\r\nundissipated in the soul-world.]\r\n\r\nIn _Art Magic_ we find the following pertinent remarks, p. 322. \"There\r\nare some features of mediumship, especially amongst those persons known\r\nas _physical force mediums_, which long since should have awakened the\r\nattention of philosophical spiritualists to the fact that there were\r\ninfluences kindred only with animal natures at work somewhere, and\r\nunless the agency of certain classes of elemental spirits was admitted\r\ninto the category of occasional control, humanity has at times assumed\r\ndarker shades than we should be willing to assign to it. Unfortunately\r\nin discussing these subjects, there are many barriers to the attainment\r\nof truth on this subject. Courtesy and compassion alike protest against\r\npointing to illustrations in our own time, whilst prejudice and\r\nignorance intervene to stifle inquiry respecting phenomena, which a long\r\nlapse of time has left us free to investigate.\r\n\r\n\"The judges whose ignorance and superstition disgraced the witchcraft\r\ntrials of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, found a solvent for\r\nall occult, or even suspicious circumstances, in the control of 'Satan\r\nand his imps.' The modern spiritualists, with few exceptions, are\r\nequally stubborn in attributing everything that transpires in\r\nspiritualistic circles, even to the wilful _cunningly contrived\r\npreparations for deception_ on the part of pretended media, to the\r\ninfluence of disembodied human spirits--good, bad, or indifferent; but\r\nthe author's own experience, confirmed by the assurances of\r\nwise-teaching spirits, impels him to assert that the tendencies to\r\nexhibit animal proclivities, whether mental, passional, or phenomenal,\r\nare most generally produced by elementals.\r\n\r\n\"The rapport with this realm of beings is generally due to certain\r\nproclivities in the individual; or, when whole communities are affected,\r\nthe cause proceeds from revolutionary movements in the realms of astral\r\nfluid; these continually affect the elementals, who, in combination with\r\nlow undeveloped spirits of humanity (elementaries), avail themselves of\r\nmagnetic epidemics to obsess susceptible individuals, and\r\nsympathetically affect communities.\"\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to _Isis Unveiled_, we find the following definition\r\nof elementary spirits:\r\n\r\n\"Properly, the disembodied _souls_ of the depraved; these souls, having\r\nat some time prior to death, separated from themselves their divine\r\nspirits, and so lost their chance of immortality. Eliphas Levi and some\r\nother Kabalists make little distinction between elementary spirits, who\r\nhave been men, and those beings which people the elements and are the\r\nblind forces of nature. Once divorced from their bodies, these souls\r\n(also called astral bodies) of purely materialistic persons, are\r\nirresistibly attracted to the earth, where they live a temporary and\r\nfinite life amid elements congenial to their gross natures. From having\r\nnever, during their natural lives, cultivated this spirituality, but\r\nsubordinated it to the material and gross, they are now unfitted for the\r\nlofty career of the pure, disembodied being, for whom the atmosphere of\r\nearth is stifling and mephitic, and whose attractions are all away from\r\nit. After a more or less prolonged period of time these material souls\r\nwill begin to disintegrate, and finally, like a column of mist, be\r\ndissolved, atom by atom, in the surrounding elements.--(Preface xxx.,\r\nvol. I.)\r\n\r\n\"After the death of the depraved and the wicked, arrives the critical\r\nmoment. If during life the ultimate and desperate effort of the\r\ninner-self to reunite itself with the faintly-glimmering ray of its\r\ndivine parent is neglected; if this ray is allowed to be more and more\r\nshut out by the thickening crust of matter, the soul, once freed from\r\nthe body, follows its earthly attractions, and is magnetically drawn\r\ninto and held within the dense fogs of the material atmosphere. Then it\r\nbegins to sink lower and lower, until it finds itself, when returned to\r\nconsciousness, in what the ancients termed Hades. The annihilation of\r\nsuch a soul is never instantaneous; it may last centuries perhaps; for\r\nnature never proceeds by jumps and starts, and the astral soul, being\r\nformed of elements, the law of evolution must bide its time. Then begins\r\nthe fearful law of compensation, the _Yin-Youan_ of the Buddhists. This\r\nclass of spirits is called the terrestrial, or _earthly_ elementary, in\r\ncontradistinction to the other classes.\" (They frequent seance rooms,\r\n&c.)--(P. 319, vol. I.)\r\n\r\nOf the danger of meddling in occult matters before understanding the\r\nelementals and elementaries, _Isis_ says, in the case of a rash\r\nintruder:\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of harmony and union will depart from the elements,\r\ndisturbed by the imprudent hand; and the currents of blind forces will\r\nbecome immediately infested by numberless creatures of matter and\r\ninstinct--the bad demons of the theurgists, the devils of theology; the\r\ngnomes, salamanders, sylphs, and undines will assail the rash performer\r\nunder multifarious aerial forms. Unable to invent anything, they will\r\nsearch your memory to its very depths; hence the nervous exhaustion and\r\nmental oppression of certain sensitive natures at spiritual circles. The\r\nelementals will bring to light long-forgotten remembrances of the past;\r\nforms, images, sweet mementos, and familiar sentences, long since faded\r\nfrom our own remembrance, but vividly preserved in the inscrutable\r\ndepths of our memory and on the astral tablets of the imperishable 'Book\r\nof Life.'\"--(P. 343, vol. I.)\r\n\r\nParacelsus speaks of _Xeni Nephidei_: \"Elemental spirits that give men\r\noccult powers over visible matter, and then feed on their brains, often\r\ncausing thereby insanity.\r\n\r\n\"Man rules potentially over all lower existences than himself,\" says the\r\nauthor of _Art Magic_ (p. 333), \"but woe to him, who by seeking aid,\r\ncounsel, or assistance, from lower grades of being, binds himself to\r\nthem; henceforth he may rest assured they will become his parasites and\r\nassociates, and as their instincts--like those of the animal\r\nkingdom--are strong in the particular direction of their nature, they\r\nare powerful to disturb, annoy, prompt to evil, and avail themselves of\r\nthe contact induced by man's invitation to drag him down to their own\r\nlevel. The legendary idea of evil compacts between man and the\r\n'Adversary' is not wholly mythical. Every wrong-doer signs that compact\r\nwith spirits who have sympathy with his evil actions.\r\n\r\n\"Except for the purposes of scientific investigation, or with a view to\r\nstrengthening ourselves against the silent and mysterious promptings to\r\nevil that beset us on every side, we warn mere curiosity-seekers, or\r\npersons ambitious to attach the legions of an unknown world to their\r\nservice, against any attempts to seek communion with elemental spirits,\r\nor beings of any grade lower than man. _Beings below mortality can grant\r\nnothing that mortality ought to ask._ They can only serve man in some\r\nembryonic department of nature, and man must stoop to their state before\r\nthey can thus reach him.... Knowledge is only good for us when we can\r\napply it judiciously. Those who investigate for the sake of science, or\r\nwith a view to enlarging the narrow boundaries of man's egotistical\r\nopinions, may venture much further into the realms of the unknown than\r\ncuriosity-seekers, or persons who desire to apply the secrets of being\r\nto selfish purposes. It may be as well also for man to remember that he\r\nand his planet are not _the all_ of being, and that, besides the\r\nrevelations included in the stupendous outpouring called 'Modern\r\nSpiritualism,' there are many problems yet to be solved in human life\r\nand planetary existences, which spiritualism does not cover, nor\r\nignorance and prejudice dream of.... Besides these considerations, we\r\nwould warn man of the many subtle, though invisible, enemies which\r\nsurround him, and, rather by the instinct of their embryonic natures\r\nthan through _malice prepense_, seek to lay siege to the garrison of the\r\nhuman heart. We would advise him, moreover, that into that sacred\r\nentrenchment no power can enter, save by invitation of the soul itself.\r\nAngels may solicit, or demons may tempt, but none can compel the spirit\r\nwithin to action, unless it first surrenders the _will_ to the investing\r\npower.\"--(_Art Magic_, p. 335.)\r\n\r\nFrom the _Theosophist_ of July 1886, we make the following extract,\r\nbearing upon the subject of the loss of immortality by soul-death, and\r\nthe dangers of Black Magic:\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary to say a few words as regards the real nature of\r\nsoul-death, and the ultimate fate of a black magician. The soul, as we\r\nhave explained above, is an isolated drop in the ocean of cosmic life.\r\nThis current of cosmic life is but the light and the aura of the Logos.\r\nBesides the Logos, there are innumerable other existences, both\r\nspiritual and astral, partaking of this life and living in it. These\r\nbeings have special affinities with particular emotions of the human\r\nsoul, and particular characteristics of the human mind. They have, of\r\ncourse, a definite individual existence of their own, which lasts up to\r\nthe end of the Manwantara. There are three ways in which a soul may\r\ncease to retain its special individuality. Separated from its Logos,\r\nwhich is, as it were, its source, it may not acquire a strong and\r\nabiding individuality of its own, and may in course of time be\r\nreabsorbed into the current of universal life. This is real soul-death.\r\nIt may also place itself _en rapport_ with a spiritual or elemental\r\nexistence by evoking it, and concentrating its attention and regard upon\r\nit for purposes of black magic and Tantric worship. In such a case it\r\ntransfers its individuality to such existence and is sucked up into it,\r\nas it were. In such a case the black magician lives in such a being, and\r\nas such a being he continues until the end of Manwantara.\"\r\n\r\nA good deal of highly interesting information on the subject of\r\nelementals and elementaries is to be found in numbers of _The Path_. A\r\nfew of the points contained in these articles may be mentioned here, but\r\nthe reader is strongly recommended to study these articles, entitled\r\n_Conversations on Occultism_, for himself. According to the writer:\r\n\r\nAn elemental is a center of force, without intelligence, as we\r\nunderstand the word, without moral character or tendencies similar to\r\nours, but capable of being directed in its movements by human thoughts,\r\nwhich may, consciously or not, give it any form, and endow it to a\r\ncertain extent with what we call intelligence. We give them form by a\r\nspecies of thought which the mind does not register--involuntary and\r\nunconscious thought--\"as, one person might shape an elemental so as to\r\nseem like an insect, and not be able to tell whether he had thought of\r\nsuch a thing or not.\" The elemental world interpenetrates this one, and\r\nelementals are constantly being attracted to, or repelled from, human\r\nbeings, taking the prevailing color of their thoughts. Time and space,\r\nas we understand them, do not exist for elementals. They can be seen\r\nclairvoyantly in the shapes they assume under different influences, and\r\nthey do many of the phenomena of the seance room. Light and the\r\nconcentrated attention of any one make a disturbance in the magnetism of\r\na room, interfering with their work in that respect. At seances\r\nelementaries also are present; these are shells, or half-dead human\r\nbeings. The elementaries are not all bad, however, but the worst are the\r\nstrongest, because the most attracted to material life. They are all\r\nhelped and galvanized into action by elementals.\r\n\r\nContact with these beings has a deteriorating effect in all cases.\r\nClairvoyants see in the astral light surrounding a person the images of\r\npeople or events that have made an impression on that person's mind, and\r\nthey frequently mistake these echoes and reflections for astral\r\nrealities; only the trained seer can distinguish. The whole astral world\r\nis full of illusions.\r\n\r\nElementals have not got _being_ such as mortals have. There are\r\ndifferent classes for the different planes of nature. Each class is\r\nconfined to its own plane, and many can never be recognized by men. The\r\nelemental world is a strong factor in Karma. Formerly, when men were\r\nless selfish and more spiritual, the elementals were friendly. They have\r\nbecome unfriendly by reason of man's indifference to, and want of\r\nsympathy with the rest of creation. Man has also colored the astral\r\nworld with his own selfish and brutal thoughts, and produced an\r\natmosphere of evil which he himself breathes. When men shall cultivate\r\nfeelings of brotherly affection for each other, and of sympathy with\r\nnature, the elementals will change their present hostile attitude for\r\none of helpfulness.\r\n\r\nElementals aid in the performance of phenomena produced by adepts. They\r\nalso enter the sphere of unprotected persons, and especially of those\r\nwho study occultism, thus precipitating the results of past Karma.\r\n\r\nThe adepts are reluctant to speak of elementals for two reasons. Because\r\nit is useless, as people could not understand the subject in their\r\npresent state of intellectual and spiritual development; and because, if\r\nany knowledge of them were given, some persons might be able to come\r\ninto contact with them to their own detriment and that of the world. In\r\nthe present state of universal selfishness and self-seeking, the\r\nelementals would be employed to work evil, as they are in themselves\r\ncolorless, taking their character from those who employ them. The\r\nadepts, therefore, keep back or hide the knowledge of these beings from\r\nmen of science, and from the world in general. By-and-by, however,\r\nmaterial science will rediscover black magic, and then will come a war\r\nbetween the good and evil powers, and the evil powers will be overcome,\r\nas always happens in such cases. Eventually all about the elementals\r\nwill be known to men--when they have developed intellectually, morally,\r\nand spiritually sufficiently to have that knowledge without danger.\r\n\r\nElementals guard hidden treasures; they obey the adepts, however, who\r\ncould command the use of untold wealth if they cared to draw upon these\r\nhidden deposits.\r\n\r\n     N. B.--Nizida has quoted from _Man: Fragments of Forgotten\r\n     History_. The S. P.

The same may be said of _Art-Magic_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WITCH'S DEN\r\n\r\nBY MME. HELENA BLAVATSKY\r\n\r\n\r\nOur kind host Sham Rao was very gay during the remaining hours of our\r\nvisit. He did his best to entertain us, and would not hear of our\r\nleaving the neighborhood without having seen its greatest celebrity, its\r\nmost interesting sight. A _jadu wala_--sorceress--well known in the\r\ndistrict, was just at this time under the influence of seven\r\nsister-goddesses, who took possession of her by turns, and spoke their\r\noracles through her lips. Sham Rao said we must not fail to see her, be\r\nit only in the interests of science.\r\n\r\nThe evening closes in, and we once more get ready for an excursion. It\r\nis only five miles to the cavern of the Pythia of Hindostan; the road\r\nruns through a jungle, but it is level and smooth. Besides, the jungle\r\nand its ferocious inhabitants have ceased to frighten us. The timid\r\nelephants we had in the \"dead city\" are sent home, and we are to mount\r\nnew behemoths belonging to a neighboring Raja. The pair that stand\r\nbefore the verandah like two dark hillocks are steady and trustworthy.\r\nMany a time these two have hunted the royal tiger, and no wild shrieking\r\nor thunderous roaring can frighten them. And so, let us start! The ruddy\r\nflames of the torches dazzle our eyes and increase the forest gloom.\r\nOur surroundings seem so dark, so mysterious. There is something\r\nindescribably fascinating, almost solemn, in these night-journeys in the\r\nout-of-the-way corners of India. Everything is silent and deserted\r\naround you, everything is dozing on the earth and overhead. Only the\r\nheavy, regular tread of the elephants breaks the stillness of the night,\r\nlike the sound of falling hammers in the underground smithy of Vulcan.\r\nFrom time to time uncanny voices and murmurs are heard in the black\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\"The wind sings its strange song amongst the ruins,\" says one of us,\r\n\"what a wonderful acoustic phenomenon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bhuta, bhuta!\" whisper the awestruck torch-bearers. They brandish their\r\ntorches and swiftly spin on one leg, and snap their fingers to chase\r\naway the aggressive spirits.\r\n\r\nThe plaintive murmur is lost in the distance. The forest is once more\r\nfilled with the cadences of its invisible nocturnal life--the metallic\r\nwhirr of the crickets, the feeble, monotonous croak of the tree-frog,\r\nthe rustle of the leaves. From time to time all this suddenly stops\r\nshort and then begins again, gradually increasing and increasing.\r\n\r\nHeavens! What teeming life, what stores of vital energy are hidden under\r\nthe smallest leaf, the most imperceptible blades of grass, in this\r\ntropical forest! Myriads of stars shine in the dark blue of the sky, and\r\nmyriads of fireflies twinkle at us from every bush, moving sparks, like\r\na pale reflection of the far-away stars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe left the thick forest behind us, and reached a deep glen, on three\r\nsides bordered with the thick forest, where even by day the shadows are\r\nas dark as by night. We were about two thousand feet above the foot of\r\nthe Vindhya ridge, judging by the ruined wall of Mandu, straight above\r\nour heads.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a very chilly wind rose that nearly blew our torches out.\r\nCaught in the labyrinth of bushes and rocks, the wind angrily shook the\r\nbranches of the blossoming syringas, then, shaking itself free, it\r\nturned back along the glen and flew down the valley, howling, whistling\r\nand shrieking, as if all the fiends of the forest together were joining\r\nin a funeral song.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are,\" said Sham Rao, dismounting. \"Here is the village; the\r\nelephants cannot go any further.\"\r\n\r\n\"The village? Surely you are mistaken. I don't see anything but trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is too dark to see the village. Besides, the huts are so small, and\r\nso hidden by the bushes, that even by daytime you could hardly find\r\nthem. And there is no light in the houses, for fear of the spirits.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where is your witch? Do you mean we are to watch her performance in\r\ncomplete darkness?\"\r\n\r\nSham Rao cast a furtive, timid look round him; and his voice, when he\r\nanswered our questions, was somewhat tremulous.\r\n\r\n\"I implore you not to call her a witch! She may hear you.... It is not\r\nfar off, it is not more than half a mile. Do not allow this short\r\ndistance to shake your decision. No elephant, and not even a horse,\r\ncould make its way there. We must walk.... But we shall find plenty of\r\nlight there....\"\r\n\r\nThis was unexpected, and far from agreeable. To walk in this gloomy\r\nIndian night; to scramble through thickets of cactuses; to venture in a\r\ndark forest, full of wild animals--this was too much for Miss X--. She\r\ndeclared that she would go no further. She would wait for us in the\r\nhowdah on the elephant's back, and perhaps would go to sleep.\r\n\r\nNarayan was against this _parti de plaisir_ from the very beginning, and\r\nnow, without explaining his reasons, he said she was the only sensible\r\none among us.\r\n\r\n\"You won't lose anything,\" he remarked, \"by staying where you are. And I\r\nonly wish every one would follow your example.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ground have you for saying so, I wonder?\" remonstrated Sham Rao,\r\nand a slight note of disappointment rang in his voice, when he saw that\r\nthe excursion, proposed and organized by himself, threatened to come to\r\nnothing. \"What harm could be done by it? I won't insist any more that\r\nthe 'incarnation of gods' is a rare sight, and that the Europeans hardly\r\never have an opportunity of witnessing it; but, besides, the Kangalim in\r\nquestion is no ordinary woman. She leads a holy life; she is a\r\nprophetess, and her blessing could not prove harmful to any one. I\r\ninsisted on this excursion out of pure patriotism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sahib, if your patriotism consists in displaying before foreigners the\r\nworst of our plagues, then why did you not order all the lepers of your\r\ndistrict to assemble and parade before the eyes of our guests? You are a\r\n_patel_, you have the power to do it.\"\r\n\r\nHow bitterly Narayan's voice sounded to our unaccustomed ears. Usually\r\nhe was so even-tempered, so indifferent to everything belonging to the\r\nexterior world.\r\n\r\nFearing a quarrel between the Hindus, the colonel remarked, in a\r\nconciliatory tone, that it was too late for us to reconsider our\r\nexpedition. Besides, without being a believer in the \"incarnation of\r\ngods,\" he was personally firmly convinced that demoniacs existed even in\r\nthe West. He was eager to study every psychological phenomenon, wherever\r\nhe met with it, and whatever shape it might assume.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a striking sight for our European and American\r\nfriends if they had beheld our procession on that dark night. Our way\r\nlay along a narrow winding path up the mountain. Not more than two\r\npeople could walk together--and we were thirty, including the\r\ntorch-bearers. Surely some reminiscence of night sallies against the\r\nConfederate Southerners had revived in the colonel's breast, judging by\r\nthe readiness with which he took upon himself the leadership of our\r\nsmall expedition. He ordered all the rifles and revolvers to be loaded,\r\ndespatched three torch-bearers to march ahead of us, and arranged us in\r\npairs. Under such a skilled chieftain we had nothing to fear from\r\ntigers; and so our procession started, and slowly crawled up the winding\r\npath.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the inquisitive travelers, who appeared later on,\r\nin the den of the prophetess of Mandu, shone through the freshness and\r\nelegance of their costumes. My gown, as well as the traveling suits of\r\nthe colonel and of Mr. Y-- were nearly torn to pieces. The cactuses\r\ngathered from us whatever tribute they could, and the Babu's disheveled\r\nhair swarmed with a whole colony of grasshoppers and fireflies, which\r\nprobably, were attracted thither by the smell of cocoanut oil. The stout\r\nSham Rao panted like a steam engine. Narayan alone was like his usual\r\nself--that is to say, like a bronze Hercules, armed with a club. At the\r\nlast abrupt turn of the path, after having surmounted the difficulty of\r\nclimbing over huge, scattered stones, we suddenly found ourselves on a\r\nperfectly smooth place; our eyes, in spite of our many torches, were\r\ndazzled with light, and our ears were struck by a medley of unusual\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nA new glen opened before us, the entrance of which, from the valley, was\r\nwell masked by thick trees. We understood how easily we might have\r\nwandered round it, without ever suspecting its existence. At the bottom\r\nof the glen we discovered the abode of the celebrated Kangalim.\r\n\r\nThe den, as it turned out, was situated in the ruin of an old Hindu\r\ntemple in tolerably good preservation. In all probability it was built\r\nlong before the \"Dead City,\" because during the epoch of the latter, the\r\nheathen were not allowed to have their own places of worship; and the\r\ntemple stood quite close to the wall of the town, in fact, right under\r\nit. The cupolas of the two smaller lateral pagodas had fallen long ago,\r\nand huge bushes grew out of their altars. This evening their branches\r\nwere hidden under a mass of bright-colored rags, bits of ribbon, little\r\npots, and various other talismans, because, even in them, popular\r\nsuperstition sees something sacred.\r\n\r\n\"And are not these poor people right? Did not these bushes grow on\r\nsacred ground? Is not their sap impregnated with the incense of\r\nofferings, and the exhalations of holy anchorites, who once lived and\r\nbreathed here?\"\r\n\r\nThe learned but superstitious Sham Rao would only answer our questions\r\nby new questions.\r\n\r\nBut the central temple, built of red granite, stood unharmed by time,\r\nand, as we learned afterwards, a deep tunnel opened just behind its\r\nclosely-shut door. What was beyond it no one knew. Sham Rao assured us\r\nthat no man of the last three generations had ever stepped over the\r\nthreshold of this thick iron door; no one had seen the subterranean\r\npassage for many years. Kangalim lived there in perfect isolation, and,\r\naccording to the oldest people in the neighborhood, she had always lived\r\nthere. Some people said she was three hundred years old; others alleged\r\nthat a certain old man on his death-bed had revealed to his son that\r\nthis old woman was no one else than _his own uncle_. This fabulous uncle\r\nhad settled in the cave in the times when the \"Dead City\" still counted\r\nseveral hundreds of inhabitants. The hermit, busy paving his road to\r\nMoksha, had no intercourse with the rest of the world, and nobody knew\r\nhow he lived and what he ate. But a good while ago, in the days when the\r\nBellati (foreigners) had not yet taken possession of this mountain, the\r\nold hermit suddenly was transformed into a hermitess. She continues his\r\npursuits and speaks with his voice, and often in his name; but she\r\nreceives worshippers, which was not the practice of her predecessor.\r\n\r\nWe had come too early, and the Pythia did not at first appear. But the\r\nsquare before the temple was full of people, and a wild though\r\npicturesque scene it was. An enormous bonfire blazed in the center, and\r\nround it crowded the naked savages like so many black gnomes, adding\r\nwhole branches of trees sacred to the seven sister-goddesses. Slowly and\r\nevenly they all jumped from one leg to another to a tune of a single\r\nmonotonous musical phrase, which they repeated in chorus, accompanied by\r\nseveral local drums and tambourines. The hushed trill of the latter\r\nmingled with the forest echoes and the hysterical moans of two little\r\ngirls, who lay under a heap of leaves by the fire. The poor children\r\nwere brought here by their mothers, in the hope that the goddesses would\r\ntake pity upon them and banish the two evil spirits under whose\r\nobsession they were. Both mothers were quite young, and sat on their\r\nheels blankly and sadly staring at the flames. No one paid us the\r\nslightest attention when we appeared, and afterwards during all our stay\r\nthese people acted as if we were invisible. Had we worn a cap of\r\ndarkness they could not have behaved more strangely.\r\n\r\n\"They feel the approach of the gods! The atmosphere is full of their\r\nsacred emanations!\" mysteriously explained Sham Rao, contemplating with\r\nreverence the natives, whom his beloved Haeckel might have easily\r\nmistaken for his \"missing link,\" the brood of his _Bathybius Haeckelii_.\r\n\r\n\"They are simply under the influence of toddy and opium!\" retorted the\r\nirreverent Babu.\r\n\r\nThe lookers-on moved as in a dream, as if they all were only\r\nhalf-awakened somnambulists, but the actors were simply victims of St.\r\nVitus's dance. One of them, a tall old man, a mere skeleton with a long\r\nwhite beard, left the ring and begun whirling vertiginously, with his\r\narms spread like wings, and loudly grinding his long, wolf-like teeth.\r\nHe was painful and disgusting to look at. He soon fell down, and was\r\ncarelessly, almost mechanically pushed aside by the feet of the others\r\nstill engaged in their demoniac performance.\r\n\r\nAll this was frightful enough, but many more horrors were in store for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWaiting for the appearance of the _prima donna_ of this forest opera\r\ncompany, we sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, ready to ask\r\ninnumerable questions of our condescending host. But I was hardly seated\r\nwhen a feeling of indescribable astonishment and horror made me shrink\r\nback.\r\n\r\nI beheld the skull of a monstrous animal, the like of which I could not\r\nfind in my zoological reminiscences.\r\n\r\nThis head was much larger than the head of an elephant skeleton. And\r\nstill it could not be anything but an elephant, judging by the skilfully\r\nrestored trunk, which wound down to my feet like a gigantic black leech.\r\nBut an elephant has no horns, whereas this one had four of them! The\r\nfront pair stuck from the flat forehead slightly bending forward and\r\nthen spreading out; and the others had a wide base, like the root of a\r\ndeer's horn, that gradually decreased almost up to the middle, and bore\r\nlong branches enough to decorate a dozen ordinary elks. Pieces of the\r\ntransparent amber-yellow rhinoceros skin were strained over the empty\r\neye-holes of the skull, and small lamps burning behind them only added\r\nto the horror, the devilish appearance of this head.\r\n\r\n\"What can this be?\" was our unanimous question. None of us had ever met\r\nanything like it, and even the colonel looked aghast.\r\n\r\n\"It is a Sivatherium,\" said Narayan. \"Is it possible you never came\r\nacross these fossils in European museums? Their remains are common\r\nenough in the Himalayas, though, of course, in fragments. They were\r\ncalled after Shiva.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the collector of this district ever hears that this antediluvian\r\nrelic adorns the den of your--ahem!--witch,\" remarked the Babu, \"it\r\nwon't adorn it many days longer.\"\r\n\r\nAll around the skull and on the floor of the portico there were heaps of\r\nwhite flowers, which, though not quite antediluvian, were totally\r\nunknown to us. They were as large as a big rose, and their white petals\r\nwere covered with a red powder, the inevitable concomitant of every\r\nIndian religious ceremony. Further on there were groups of cocoanuts,\r\nand large brass dishes filled with rice, each adorned with a red or\r\ngreen taper. In the center of the portico there stood a queer-shaped\r\ncenser, surrounded with chandeliers. A little boy, dressed from head to\r\nfoot in white, threw into it handfuls of aromatic powders.\r\n\r\n\"These people, who assemble here to worship Kangalim,\" said Sham Rao,\r\n\"do not actually belong either to her sect or to any other. They are\r\ndevil-worshippers. They do not believe in Hindu gods; they live in small\r\ncommunities; they belong to one of the many Indian races which usually\r\nare called the hill-tribes. Unlike the Shanars of Southern Travancore,\r\nthey do not use the blood of sacrificial animals; they do not build\r\nseparate temples to their bhutas. But they are possessed by the strange\r\nfancy that the goddess Kali, the wife of Shiva, from time immemorial has\r\nhad a grudge against them, and sends her favorite evil spirits to\r\ntorture them. Save this little difference, they have the same beliefs\r\nas the Shanars. God does not exist for them; and even Shiva is\r\nconsidered by them as an ordinary spirit. Their chief worship is offered\r\nto the souls of the dead. These souls, however righteous and kind they\r\nmay be in their lifetime, become after death as wicked as can be; they\r\nare happy only when they are torturing living men and cattle. As the\r\nopportunities of doing so are the only reward for the virtues they\r\npossessed when incarnated, a very wicked man is punished by becoming\r\nafter his death a very soft-hearted ghost; he loathes his loss of\r\ndaring, and is altogether miserable. The results of this strange logic\r\nare not bad, nevertheless. These savages and devil-worshippers are the\r\nkindest and the most truth-loving of all the hill-tribes. They do\r\nwhatever they can to be worthy of their ultimate reward; because, don't\r\nyou see, they all long to become the wickedest of devils!\"\r\n\r\nAnd put in good humor by his own wittiness, Sham Rao laughed till his\r\nhilarity became offensive, considering the sacredness of the place.\r\n\r\n\"A year ago some business matters sent me to Tinevelli,\" continued he.\r\n\"Staying with a friend of mine, who is a Shanar, I was allowed to be\r\npresent at one of the ceremonies in the honor of devils. No European has\r\nas yet witnessed this worship, whatever the missionaries may say; but\r\nthere are many converts amongst the Shanars, who willingly describe them\r\nto the _padres_. My friend is a wealthy man, which is probably the\r\nreason why the devils are especially vicious to him. They poison his\r\ncattle, spoil his crops and his coffee plants, and persecute his\r\nnumerous relations, sending them sunstrokes, madness and epilepsy, over\r\nwhich illnesses they especially preside. These wicked demons have\r\nsettled in every corner of his spacious landed property--in the woods,\r\nthe ruins, and even in his stables. To avert all this, my friend covered\r\nhis land with stucco pyramids, and prayed humbly, asking the demons to\r\ndraw their portraits on each of them, so that he may recognize them and\r\nworship each of them separately, as the rightful owner of this, or that,\r\nparticular pyramid. And what do you think?... Next morning all the\r\npyramids were found covered with drawings. Each of them bore an\r\nincredibly good likeness of the dead of the neighborhood. My friend had\r\nknown personally almost all of them. He found also a portrait of his own\r\nlate father amongst the lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well? And was he satisfied?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he was very glad, very satisfied. It enabled him to choose the\r\nright thing to gratify the personal tastes of each demon, don't you see?\r\nHe was not vexed at finding his father's portrait. His father was\r\nsomewhat irascible; once he nearly broke both his son's legs,\r\nadministering to him fatherly punishment with an iron bar, so that he\r\ncould not possibly be very dangerous after his death. But another\r\nportrait, found on the best and the prettiest of the pyramids, amazed my\r\nfriend a good deal, and put him in a blue funk. The whole district\r\nrecognized an English officer, a certain Captain Pole, who in his\r\nlifetime was as kind a gentleman as ever lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? But do you mean to say that this strange people worshipped\r\nCaptain Pole also?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they did! Captain Pole was such a worthy man, such an honest\r\nofficer, that, after his death, he could not help being promoted to the\r\nhighest rank of Shanar devils. The Pe-Kovil, demon's-house, sacred to\r\nhis memory, stands side by side with the Pe-Kovil Bhadrakali, which was\r\nrecently conferred on the wife of a certain German missionary, who also\r\nwas a most charitable lady and so is very dangerous now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are their ceremonies? Tell us something about their rites.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their rites consist chiefly of dancing, singing, and killing\r\nsacrificial animals. The Shanars have no castes, and eat all kinds of\r\nmeat. The crowd assembles about the Pe-Kovil, previously designated by\r\nthe priest; there is a general beating of drums, and slaughtering of\r\nfowls, sheep and goats. When Captain Pole's turn came an ox was killed,\r\nas a thoughtful attention to the peculiar tastes of his nation. The\r\npriest appeared, covered with bangles, and holding a wand on which\r\ntinkled numberless little bells, and wearing garlands of red and white\r\nflowers round his neck, and a black mantle, on which were embroidered\r\nthe ugliest fiends you can imagine. Horns were blown and drums rolled\r\nincessantly. And oh, I forgot to tell you there was also a kind of\r\nfiddle, the secret of which is known only to the Shanar priesthood. Its\r\nbow is ordinary enough, made of bamboo; but it is whispered that the\r\nstrings are human veins.... When Captain Pole took possession of the\r\npriest's body, the priest leaped high in the air, and then rushed on the\r\nox and killed him. He drank off the hot blood, and then began his dance.\r\nBut what a fright he was when dancing! You know, I am not\r\nsuperstitious.... Am I?...\"\r\n\r\nSham Rao looked at us inquiringly, and I, for one, was glad at this\r\nmoment that Miss X-- was half a mile off, asleep in the howdah.\r\n\r\n\"He turned, and turned, as if possessed by all the demons of Naraka. The\r\nenraged crowd hooted and howled when the priest begun to inflict deep\r\nwounds all over his body with the bloody sacrificial knife. To see him,\r\nwith his hair waving in the wind and his mouth covered with foam; to see\r\nhim bathing in the blood of the sacrificed animal, mixing it with his\r\nown, was more than I could bear. I felt as if hallucinated, I fancied I\r\nalso was spinning round....\"\r\n\r\nSham Rao stopped abruptly, struck dumb. Kangalim stood before us!\r\n\r\nHer appearance was so unexpected that we all felt embarrassed. Carried\r\naway by Sham Rao's description, we had noticed neither how nor whence\r\nshe came. Had she appeared from beneath the earth we could not have been\r\nmore astonished. Narayan stared at her, opening wide his big jet-black\r\neyes; the Babu clicked his tongue in utter confusion.\r\n\r\nImagine a skeleton seven feet high, covered with brown leather, with a\r\ndead child's tiny head stuck on its bony shoulders; the eyes set so deep\r\nand at the same time flashing such fiendish flames all through your body\r\nthat you begin to feel your brain stop working, your thoughts become\r\nentangled and your blood freeze in your veins.\r\n\r\nI describe my personal impressions, and no words of mine can do them\r\njustice. My description is too weak. Mr. Y-- and the colonel both grew\r\npale under her stare and Mr. Y-- made a movement as if about to rise.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that such an impression could not last. As soon as the\r\nwitch had turned her gleaming eyes to the kneeling crowd, it vanished as\r\nswiftly as it had come. But still all our attention was fixed on this\r\nremarkable creature.\r\n\r\nThree hundred years old! Who can tell? Judging by her appearance, we\r\nmight as well conjecture her to be a thousand. We beheld a genuine\r\nliving mummy, or rather a mummy endowed with motion. She seemed to have\r\nbeen withering since the creation. Neither time, nor the ills of life,\r\nnor the elements could ever affect this living statue of death. The\r\nall-destroying hand of time had touched her and stopped short. Time\r\ncould do no more, and so had left her. And with all this, not a single\r\ngray hair. Her long black locks shone with a greenish sheen, and fell in\r\nheavy masses down to her knees.\r\n\r\nTo my great shame, I must confess that a disgusting reminiscence flashed\r\ninto my memory. I thought about the hair and the nails of corpses\r\ngrowing in the graves, and tried to examine the nails of the old woman.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, she stood motionless as if suddenly transformed into an ugly\r\nidol. In one hand she held a dish with a piece of burning camphor, in\r\nthe other a handful of rice, and she never removed her burning eyes from\r\nthe crowd. The pale yellow flame of the camphor flickered in the wind,\r\nand lit up her death-like head, almost touching her chin; but she paid\r\nno heed to it. Her neck, as wrinkled as a mushroom, as thin as a stick,\r\nwas surrounded by three rows of golden medallions. Her head was adorned\r\nwith a golden snake. Her grotesque, hardly human body was covered by a\r\npiece of saffron-yellow muslin.\r\n\r\nThe demoniac little girls raised their heads from beneath the leaves,\r\nand set up a prolonged animal-like howl. Their example was followed by\r\nthe old man, who lay exhausted by his frantic dance.\r\n\r\nThe witch tossed her head convulsively, and began her invocations,\r\nrising on tiptoe, as if moved by some external force.\r\n\r\n\"The goddess, one of the seven sisters, begins to take possession of\r\nher,\" whispered Sham Rao, not even thinking of wiping away the big drops\r\nof sweat that streamed from his brow. \"Look, look at her!\"\r\n\r\nThis advice was quite superfluous. We _were_ looking at her, and at\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nAt first, the movements of the witch were slow, unequal, somewhat\r\nconvulsive; then, gradually, they became less angular; at last, as if\r\ncatching the cadence of the drums, leaning all her long body forward,\r\nand writhing like an eel, she rushed round and round the blazing\r\nbonfire. A dry leaf caught in a hurricane could not fly swifter. Her\r\nbare bony feet trod noiselessly on the rocky ground. The long locks of\r\nher hair flew round her like snakes, lashing the spectators, who knelt,\r\nstretching their trembling arms towards her, and writhing as if they\r\nwere alive. Whoever was touched by one of this Fury's black curls, fell\r\ndown on the ground, overcome with happiness, shouting thanks to the\r\ngoddess, and considering himself blessed forever. It was not human hair\r\nthat touched the happy elect, it was the goddess herself, one of the\r\nseven.\r\n\r\nSwifter and swifter fly her decrepit legs; the young, vigorous hands of\r\nthe drummer can hardly follow her. But she does not think of catching\r\nthe measure of his music; she rushes, she flies forward. Staring with\r\nher expressionless, motionless orbs at something before her, at\r\nsomething that is not visible to our mortal eyes, she hardly glances at\r\nher worshippers; then her look becomes full of fire, and whoever she\r\nlooks at feels burned through to the marrow of his bones. At every\r\nglance she throws a few grains of rice. The small handful seems\r\ninexhaustible, as if the wrinkled palm contained the bottomless bag of\r\nPrince Fortunatus.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stops as if thunderstruck.\r\n\r\nThe mad race round the bonfire had lasted twelve minutes, but we looked\r\nin vain for a trace of fatigue on the death-like face of the witch. She\r\nstopped only for a moment, just the necessary time for the goddess to\r\nrelease her. As soon as she felt free, by a single effort she jumped\r\nover the fire and plunged into the deep tank by the portico. This time\r\nshe plunged only once, and whilst she stayed under the water the second\r\nsister-goddess entered her body. The little boy in white produced\r\nanother dish, with a new piece of burning camphor, just in time for the\r\nwitch to take it up, and to rush again on her headlong way.\r\n\r\nThe colonel sat with his watch in his hand. During the second obsession\r\nthe witch ran, leaped, and raced for exactly fourteen minutes. After\r\nthis, she plunged twice in the tank, in honor of the second sister; and\r\nwith every new obsession the number of her plunges increased, till it\r\nbecame six.\r\n\r\nIt was already an hour and a half since the race began. All this time\r\nthe witch never rested, stopping only for a few seconds, to disappear\r\nunder the water.\r\n\r\n\"She is a fiend, she cannot be a woman!\" exclaimed the colonel, seeing\r\nthe head of the witch immersed for the sixth time in the water.\r\n\r\n\"Hang me if I know!\" grumbled Mr. Y--, nervously pulling his beard. \"The\r\nonly thing I know is that a grain of her cursed rice entered my throat,\r\nand I can't get it out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush! Please, do be quiet!\" implored Sham Rao. \"By talking you\r\nwill spoil the whole business!\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at Narayan and lost myself in conjectures.\r\n\r\nHis features, which usually were so calm and serene, were quite altered\r\nat this moment by a deep shadow of suffering. His lips trembled, and the\r\npupils of his eyes were dilated, as if by a dose of belladonna. His eyes\r\nwere lifted over the heads of the crowd, as if in his disgust he tried\r\nnot to see what was before him, and at the same time could not see it,\r\nengaged in a deep reverie which carried him away from us and from the\r\nwhole performance.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with him?\" was my thought, but I had no time to ask\r\nhim, because the witch was again in full swing, chasing her own shadow.\r\n\r\nBut with the seventh goddess the program was slightly changed. The\r\nrunning of the old woman changed to leaping. Sometimes bending down to\r\nthe ground, like a black panther, she leaped up to some worshipper, and\r\nhalting before him touched his forehead with her finger, while her long,\r\nthin body shook with inaudible laughter. Then, again, as if shrinking\r\nback playfully from her shadow, and chased by it, in some uncanny game,\r\nthe witch appeared to us like a horrid caricature of Dinorah, dancing\r\nher mad dance. Suddenly she straightened herself to her full height,\r\ndarted to the portico and crouched before the smoking censer, beating\r\nher forehead against the granite steps. Another jump, and she was quite\r\nclose to us, before the head of the monstrous Sivatherium. She knelt\r\ndown again and bowed her head to the ground several times, with the\r\nsound of an empty barrel knocked against something hard.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly the time to spring to our feet and shrink back when she\r\nappeared on the top of the Sivatherium's head, standing there amongst\r\nthe horns.\r\n\r\nNarayan alone did not stir, and fearlessly looked straight in the eyes\r\nof the frightful sorceress.\r\n\r\nBut what was this? Who spoke in those deep manly tones? Her lips were\r\nmoving, from her breast were issuing those quick, abrupt phrases, but\r\nthe voice sounded hollow as if coming from beneath the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush!\" whispered Sham Rao, his whole body trembling. \"She is\r\ngoing to prophesy!...\"\r\n\r\n\"She?\" incredulously inquired Mr. Y--. \"This a woman's voice? I don't\r\nbelieve it for a moment. Someone's uncle must be stowed away somewhere\r\nabout the place. Not the fabulous uncle she inherited from, but a real\r\nlive one!...\"\r\n\r\nSham Rao winced under the irony of this supposition, and cast an\r\nimploring look at the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Woe to you! woe to you!\" echoed the voice. \"Woe to you, children of the\r\nimpure Jaya and Vijaya! of the mocking, unbelieving lingerers round\r\ngreat Shiva's door! Ye, who are cursed by eighty thousand sages! Woe to\r\nyou who believe not in the goddess Kali, and you who deny us, her seven\r\ndivine sisters! Flesh-eating, yellow-legged vultures! friends of the\r\noppressors of our land! dogs who are not ashamed to eat from the same\r\ntrough with the Bellati!\" (foreigners).\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that your prophetess only foretells the past,\" said Mr.\r\nY--, philosophically putting his hands in his pockets. \"I should say\r\nthat she is hinting at you, my dear Sham Rao.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! and at us also,\" murmured the colonel, who was evidently beginning\r\nto feel uneasy.\r\n\r\nAs to the unlucky Sham Rao, he broke out in a cold sweat, and tried to\r\nassure us that we were mistaken, that we did not fully understand her\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\"It is not about you, it is not about you! It is of me she speaks,\r\nbecause I am in Government service. Oh, she is inexorable!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rakshasas! Asuras!\" thundered the voice. \"How dare you appear before\r\nus? how dare you to stand on this holy ground in boots made of a cow's\r\nsacred skin? Be cursed for etern----\"\r\n\r\nBut her curse was not destined to be finished. In an instant the\r\nHercules-like Narayan had fallen on the Sivatherium, and upset the whole\r\npile, the skull, the horns and the demoniac Pythia included. A second\r\nmore, and we thought we saw the witch flying in the air towards the\r\nportico. A confused vision of a stout, shaven Brahman, suddenly emerging\r\nfrom under the Sivatherium and instantly disappearing in the hollow\r\nbeneath it, flashed before my dilated eyes.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! after the third second had passed, we all came to the\r\nembarrassing conclusion that, judging from the loud clang of the door\r\nof the cave, the representative of the Seven Sisters had ignominiously\r\nfled. The moment she had disappeared from our inquisitive eyes to her\r\nsubterranean domain, we all realized that the unearthly hollow voice we\r\nhad heard had nothing supernatural about it and belonged to the Brahman\r\nhidden under the Sivatherium--to some one's live uncle, as Mr. Y-- had\r\nrightly supposed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOh, Narayan! how carelessly, how disorderly the worlds rotate around us.\r\nI begin to seriously doubt their reality. From this moment I shall\r\nearnestly believe that all things in the universe are nothing but\r\nillusion, a mere Maya. I am becoming a Vedantin.... I doubt that in the\r\nwhole universe there may be found anything more objective than a Hindu\r\nwitch flying up the spout.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss X-- woke up, and asked what was the meaning of all this noise. The\r\nnoise of many voices and the sounds of the many retreating footsteps,\r\nthe general rush of the crowd, had frightened her. She listened to us\r\nwith a condescending smile, and a few yawns, and went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nNext morning, at daybreak, we very reluctantly, it must be owned, bade\r\ngood-by to the kind-hearted, good-natured Sham Rao. The confoundingly\r\neasy victory of Narayan hung heavily on his mind. His faith in the holy\r\nhermitess and the seven goddesses was a good deal shaken by the shameful\r\ncapitulation of the sisters, who had surrendered at the first blow from\r\na mere mortal. But during the dark hours of the night he had had time\r\nto think it over, and to shake off the uneasy feeling of having\r\nunwillingly misled and disappointed his European friends.\r\n\r\nSham Rao still looked confused when he shook hands with us at parting,\r\nand expressed to us the best wishes of his family and himself.\r\n\r\nAs to the heroes of this truthful narrative, they mounted their\r\nelephants once more, and directed their heavy steps towards the high\r\nroad and Jubbulpore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE PSYCHIC EXPERIENCES OF FAMOUS PERSONS\r\n\r\nBY WALTER F. PRINCE, PH.D.,\r\n\r\nOfficial Investigator American Society for Psychical Research\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not necessarily give an occult incident more weight that it was\r\nexperienced or related and credited by a person whose name is prominent\r\nfor one reason or another. The great are nearly as likely to suffer\r\nillusions, pathological hallucinations, and aberrations as the humble\r\nremainder of mankind, or, according to Lombroso a good deal more so. Nor\r\nhave famous persons a monopoly of veracity. Besides, a rare\r\npsychological incident is not more or less a problem, nor has it more or\r\nless significance in the experience of honest John Jones than in that of\r\nWilliam Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is natural and quite proper to look with somewhat enhanced\r\ninterest upon the experiences or the testimonies of those whose names\r\nare in the cyclopedias and biographical dictionaries. It is legitimate\r\nto set these forth and to call attention to them. These persons at least\r\nwe know something about. William Moggs of Waushegan, Wisconsin, may be a\r\nvery excellent and trustworthy man but we don't know him, and it is\r\ntedious to be told that somebody else whom we may know as little knows\r\nand esteems him. How do we know that the avouching unknown could not\r\nhave been sold a gold brick? But Henry M. Stanley, and General Fremont,\r\nand W. P. Frith, and Henry Clews are characters whom we do know\r\nsomething about, or at least whom we can easily look up for ourselves in\r\nbiographical dictionaries and _Who's Whos_. They are names which have at\r\nthe very outset a reputation which has impressed the world, which stand\r\nfor assured ability, genius, achievement, forcefulness of one kind or\r\nanother. Even though we have no particular data at hand regarding the\r\nveracity of a particular member of the shining circle, it is not easy to\r\nsee why he, having an assured reputation, should dim it by telling\r\nspooky lies. It is easier to conceive of William Moggs, a quite obscure\r\nman, calling attention to himself by the device, though as a rule the\r\nWilliam Moggs's do nothing of the kind. We spontaneously argue within\r\nourselves, in some inchoate fashion, \"That fellow made his mark in the\r\nworld; he gained a big reputation by his superiority to the rank and\r\nfile in some particular at least; it will be worth while to hear what he\r\nhas to say.\"\r\n\r\nWe present herewith a group of such testimonies either given out to the\r\nworld by prominent persons as their own experiences or as the\r\nexperiences of persons whom they knew and believed, or else as told by\r\nfriends of the prominent persons whose experiences they were.\r\n\r\nIt is not owing to any selective process that the material is mostly of\r\nthe sort which favors supernormal hypotheses. We take what we can get.\r\nWhenever an experience is accompanied by a normal explanation, such will\r\nbe included only a little more willingly than an experience which does\r\nnot readily suggest a normal explanation. But, let it be noted, the\r\ngroups which we propose will be composed of human _experiences_, and not\r\nopinions, except as the opinions accompany the experiences. And it\r\ncannot be expected that, after certain types of experiences as related\r\nby certain men have been given, we shall then proceed to name other men\r\nwho haven't had any such experiences. True, against Paul du Chaillu's\r\nassertion that he had seen gorillas was once urged the fact that nobody\r\nelse had ever seen gorillas. Nevertheless the sole assertion of the one\r\nman who had seen them proved to outweigh in value the lack of experience\r\non the part of all other travelers up to that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PREMONITION OF SIR H. M. STANLEY\r\n\r\nThis incident is related by the famous explorer, Sir Henry M. Stanley,\r\nin his autobiography edited by Dorothy Stanley (Houghton Mifflin Co.,\r\n1909), on pages 207-208.\r\n\r\nStanley, then a private in the Confederate Army, was captured in the\r\nbattle of Shiloh and sent to Camp Douglas near Chicago. It was while\r\nhere that the incident in question occurred.\r\n\r\n\"On the next day (April 16), after the morning duties had been\r\nperformed, the rations divided, the cooks had departed contented, and\r\nthe quarters swept, I proceeded to my nest and reclined alongside of my\r\nfriend Wilkes in a posture that gave me a command of one half of the\r\nbuilding. I made some remarks to him upon the card-playing groups\r\nopposite, when suddenly, I felt a gentle stroke on the back of my neck,\r\nand in an instant I was unconscious. The next moment I had a vivid view\r\nof the village of Tremeirchion and the grassy slopes of the hills of\r\nHirradog, and I seemed to be hovering over the rook woods of Brynbella.\r\nI glided to the bed-chamber of my Aunt Mary. My aunt was in bed, and\r\nseemed sick unto death. I took a position by the side of the bed, and\r\nsaw myself, with head bent down, listening to her parting words which\r\nsounded regretful, as though conscience smote her for not having been as\r\nkind as she might have been, or had wished to be. I heard the boy say,\r\n'I believe you, Aunt. It is neither your fault, nor mine. You were good\r\nand kind to me, and I knew you wished to be kinder; but things were so\r\nordered that you had to be what you were. I also dearly wished to love\r\nyou, but I was afraid to speak of it lest you would check me, or say\r\nsomething that would offend me. I feel our parting was in this spirit.\r\nThere is no need of regrets. You have done your duty to me, and you had\r\nchildren of your own who required all your care. What has happened to me\r\nsince, it was decreed should happen. Farewell.'\r\n\r\n\"I put forth my hand and felt the clasp of the long thin hands of the\r\nsore-sick woman. I heard a murmur of farewell, and immediately I awoke.\r\n\r\n\"It appeared to me that I had but closed my eyes. I was still in the\r\nsame reclining attitude, the groups opposite me were still engaged in\r\ntheir card games, Wilkes was in the same position. Nothing had changed.\r\n\r\n\"I asked, 'What has happened?'\r\n\r\n\"'What could happen?' said he. 'What makes you ask? It is but a moment\r\nago you were speaking to me.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, I thought I had been asleep a long time.'\r\n\r\n\"On the next day the 17th of April, 1862, my Aunt Mary died at Fynnon\r\nBeuno, in Wales!\r\n\r\n\"I believe that the soul of every human being has its attendant\r\nspirit--a nimble, delicate essence, whose method of action is by a\r\nsubtle suggestion which it contrives to insinuate into the mind, whether\r\nasleep or awake. We are too gross to be capable of understanding the\r\nsignification of the dream, the vision, or the sudden presage, or of\r\ndivining the source of the premonition or its import. We admit that we\r\nare liable to receive a fleeting picture of an act, or a figure at any\r\nmoment, but, except being struck by certain strange coincidences which\r\nhappen to most of us, we seldom make an effort to unravel the mystery.\r\nThe swift, darting messenger stamps an image on the mind, and displays a\r\nvision to the sleeper; and if, as sometimes follows, among tricks and\r\ntwists of the errant mind, by reflex acts of memory, it happens to be a\r\ntrue representation of what is to happen, we are left to grope\r\nhopelessly as to the manner and meaning of it, for there is nothing\r\ntangible to lay hold of.\r\n\r\n\"There are many things relating to my existence which are inexplicable\r\nto me, and probably it is best so; this death-bed scene, projected on my\r\nmind's screen, across four thousand five hundred miles of space, is one\r\nof these mysteries.\"\r\n\r\nThe precise meaning of the passage wherein Sir Henry speculates on the\r\nnature and meaning of such facts, is not entirely clear. Does he by the\r\nword _spirit_ mean what is usually meant by that term, or does he mean\r\nsome part of the mind functioning upon the rest as its object, like\r\nFreud's _psychic censor_ though with a different purpose? And the\r\naffirmative employment of the terms \"presage\" and \"premonition\" do not\r\nseem to be consistent with the expression \"it happens to be a true\r\nrepresentation of what is to happen.\" It seems plain that the\r\ndistinguished explorer did believe that the death-bed scene was\r\n\"projected on\" his \"mind's screen, across four thousand five hundred\r\nmiles of space.\" However, what Stanley thought about the facts is of\r\nmuch less importance than the facts themselves, as reported by one whose\r\nlife was one long drill in observing, appraising and recording facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOINCIDENT EXPERIENCES OF GENERAL FREMONT AND RELATIVES\r\n\r\nThese are related on pages 69-72 of _Recollections of Elizabeth Benton\r\nFremont, Daughter of the Pathfinder General John C. Fremont and Jessie\r\nBenton Fremont His Wife_.\r\n\r\nAfter describing a terrible experience of her father and his men in\r\n1853, while crossing the Wahsatch Mountains, and their rescue from\r\nstarvation by reaching Parowan, Utah, Miss Benton goes on:\r\n\r\n\"That night my father sat by his campfire until late in the night,\r\ndreaming of home and thinking of the great happiness of my mother. Could\r\nshe but know that he was safe! Finally he returned to his quarters in\r\nthe town only a few hundred yards away from the camp. The warm bright\r\nroom, the white bed with all suggestion of shelter and relief from\r\ndanger made the picture of home rise up like a real thing before him,\r\nand at half-past eleven at night he made an entry in his journal,\r\nputting there the thought that had possession of him and that my mother\r\nin far away Washington might know that all danger was past and that he\r\nwas safe and comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"All this is a prelude to a most uncommon experience which befell my\r\nmother in our Washington home on the night in question. We could not\r\npossibly hear from father at the earliest until midsummer. Though my\r\nmother went into society but little that year, there was no reason for\r\ngloomy forebodings. The younger members of the family kept her in close\r\ntouch with the social side of life, while her father, whose confidant\r\nshe always was, kept her informed as to the political events of the\r\nmoment. Her life was busy and filled with her full share of its\r\nresponsibilities. In midwinter, however, my mother became possessed with\r\nthe conviction that my father was starving, and no amount of reasoning\r\ncould calm her fears. The idea haunted her for two weeks or more, and\r\nfinally began to leave its physical effects upon her. She could neither\r\neat nor sleep; open-air exercise, plenty of company, the management of a\r\nhousehold, all combined, could not wean her from the belief that father\r\nand his men were starving in the desert.\r\n\r\n\"The weight of fear was lifted from her as suddenly as it came. Her\r\nyoung sister Susie and a party of relatives returned from a wedding at\r\nGeneral Jessup's on the night of February 6, 1854, and came to mother to\r\nspend the night, in order not to awaken the older members of my\r\ngrandmother's family. The girls doffed their party dresses, replaced\r\nthem with comfortable woolen gowns, and, gathered before the open fire\r\nin mother's room, were gaily relating the experiences of the evening.\r\nThe fire needed replenishing and mother went to an adjoining\r\ndressing-room to get more wood. The old-fashioned fire-place required\r\nlong logs which were too large for her to handle, and as she half knelt,\r\nbalancing the long sticks of wood on her left arm, she felt a hand rest\r\nlightly on her left shoulder, and she heard my father's laughing voice\r\nwhisper her name, 'Jessie.'\r\n\r\n\"There was no sound beyond the quick-whispered name, no presence, only\r\nthe touch, but my mother knew as people know in dreams that my father\r\nwas there, gay and happy, and intending to startle Susie, who when my\r\nmother was married was only a child of eight, and was always a pet\r\nplaymate of my father's. Her shrill, prolonged scream was his delight,\r\nand he never lost an opportunity to startle her.\r\n\r\n\"Mother came back to the girl's room, but before she could speak, Susie\r\ngave a great cry, fell in a heap upon the rug, and screamed again and\r\nagain, until mother crushed her balldress over her head to keep the\r\nsound from the neighbors. Her cousin asked mother what she had seen, and\r\nshe explained that she had seen nothing, but had heard my father tell\r\nher to keep still until he could scare Susie.\r\n\r\n\"Peace came to my mother instantly, and on retiring she fell into a\r\nrefreshing sleep from which she did not waken until ten the next\r\nmorning; all fear for the safety of father had vanished from her mind;\r\nwith sleep came strength, and she soon was her happy self again.\r\n\r\n\"When my father returned home, we learned that it was at the time the\r\nparty was starving that my mother had the premonition of evil having\r\nbefallen them, and the entry in his journal showed that exactly the\r\nmoment he had written it in Parowan, my mother had felt his presence,\r\nand in the wireless message from heart to heart knew that my father was\r\nsafe and free from harm. The hour exactly tallied with the entry in his\r\nbook, allowing for the difference in longitude.\"\r\n\r\nFurther details would have been desirable, particularly just what was\r\nthe immediate occasion of Susie's fright, for she screamed before Mrs.\r\nFremont related what had befallen herself. The only escape from the\r\nconclusion that Susie had some separate peculiar experience is to\r\nsuppose--which we may not unreasonably do--that the elder lady betrayed\r\nher own agitation before she spoke, perhaps by dropping the sticks,\r\nhurrying back, and looking strangely at Susie. We would have liked a\r\nsight of the General's journal, also, and to have been permitted to copy\r\nthe entry exactly as it stands.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though we leave Susie and her screams quite out of\r\naccount, we have a very pretty case remaining, however we explain it.\r\nMrs. Fremont's depression might be explained by the very natural fears\r\nof a woman whose husband was engaged in a possibly dangerous expedition,\r\nthough she picked out for her fears exactly the period of the expedition\r\nwhen there was an actual state of privation and danger. But why did the\r\nfear so afflicting to her health and spirits so suddenly leave her,\r\nwhile it was still winter in the mountains? And why did the hour and\r\nmoment of the cessation of these fears coincide with the hour and moment\r\nwhen the explorer was occupied with thoughts of home and writing his\r\nwish that his wife might know that he was safe?\r\n\r\nMany a reader will be disposed to answer the question \"why?\" with the\r\nfacile answer \"telepathy,\" but that word is a key which does not turn in\r\nthis lock with perfect ease. There are cases where one person thinks a\r\nparticular thing under extraordinary circumstances, and precisely that\r\nthought, or a hallucination of precisely that nature, occurs to another\r\nperson at a distance. But in this case General Fremont thinks a wish\r\nthat his wife knew he was safe, and his wife seems to feel a hand upon\r\nher shoulder, seems to hear his voice pronounce her name, and somehow\r\ngets the impression that he proposes to play a trick on her sister\r\nSusie. If exact coincidence between the thought of the supposed \"sender\"\r\nand that of the supposed \"recipient\" is a support to the theory of\r\ntelepathy as applied to one case, then wide discrepancy between the\r\ncoincident thoughts of two persons in another case should be an argument\r\nagainst the theory of telepathy as applied to that. There should be some\r\nlimit to the handicap which, by way of courtesy, the spiritistic\r\nhypothesis allows to the telepathic.\r\n\r\nIf there are spirits, and if they have a certain access to human\r\nthoughts, and if the limitations of space are little felt by them, then\r\nthe spiritistic theory would have an easier time than telepathy with the\r\nfacts in this case. A friendly intermediary might convey the assurance\r\nthat the Pathfinder wanted conveyed to his wife, and in doing so employ\r\nsuch devices as an intelligent personal agent could think up, and were\r\nwithin its grasp. The touch, the hallucination of a voice resembling\r\nthat of the absent husband, the sense of gayety, and even the very\r\ncharacteristic trait of liking to startle Susie, might all be the result\r\nof the friendly messenger's attempts to implant in Mrs. Fremont's mind a\r\nfixed assurance that somebody was safe and happy, and that this somebody\r\nwas in very truth her husband.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENTS RELATED BY DEAN HOLE\r\n\r\nThe Very Rev. Samuel Reynolds Hole, Dean of Rochester, England, was not\r\nonly an effective preacher and popular lecturer, but likewise the author\r\nof fascinating books, composed of reminiscences and shrewd and witty\r\ncomments upon men and affairs. He made two lecturing tours in America.\r\n\r\nHis _The Memories of Dean Hole_ contains a remarkable dream of his own,\r\nand one of similar character told him by a trusted friend. They may be\r\nfound on pages 200-201. After rehearsing the account of a dream and its\r\ntragic sequel told him many years before, he goes on:\r\n\r\n\"Are these dreams coincidences only, imaginations, sudden recollections\r\nof events which had been long forgotten? They are marvelous, be this as\r\nit may. In a crisis of very severe anxiety, I required information which\r\nonly one man could give me, and he was in his grave. I saw him\r\ndistinctly in a vision of the night, and his answer to my question told\r\nme all I wanted to know; and when, having obtained the clearest proof\r\nthat what I had heard was true, I communicated the incident and its\r\nresults to my solicitor, he told me that he himself had experienced a\r\nsimilar manifestation. A claim was repeated after his father's death\r\nwhich had been resisted in his lifetime and retracted by the claimant,\r\nbut the son was unable to find the letter in which the retraction was\r\nmade. He dreamed that his father appeared and told him it was in the\r\nleft hand drawer of a certain desk. Having business in London, he went\r\nup to the offices of his father, an eminent lawyer, but could not\r\ndiscover the desk, until one of the clerks suggested that it might be\r\namong some old lumber placed in a room upstairs. There he found the desk\r\nand the letter.\r\n\r\n\"Then, as regards coincidence, are there not events in our lives which\r\ncome to us with a strange mysterious significance, a prophetic\r\nintimation, sometimes of sorrow and sometimes of success? For example, I\r\nlived a hundred and fifty miles from Rochester. I went there for the\r\nfirst time to preach at the invitation of one who was then unknown to\r\nme, but is now a dear friend. After the sermon I was his guest in the\r\nPrecincts. Dean Scott died in the night, almost at the time when he who\r\nwas to succeed him arrived at the house which adjoins the Deanery. There\r\nwas no expectation of his immediate decease, and no conjecture as to a\r\nfuture appointment, and yet when I heard the tolling of the cathedral\r\nbell, I had a presentiment that Dr. Scott was dead, and that I should be\r\nDean of Rochester.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, Dean Hole in his _Then and Now_, pp. 9-11, together with some\r\nopinions of his, sets down a seeming premonition and what he considers\r\nanswers to prayer.\r\n\r\n\"There is an immeasurable difference between ghosts and other\r\napparitions--between that which witnesses declare they saw with their\r\nown eyes when they were wide awake--as Hamlet saw the ghost of his\r\nfather, and Macbeth saw Banquo--and that which presents itself to us\r\nwhen we are asleep, or in that condition between waking and sleeping\r\nwhich makes the vision so like reality. I do not believe in the former,\r\nand I am fully persuaded in my own mind that the wonderful stories which\r\nwe hear are to be accounted for either as exaggerations or as the result\r\nof natural causes which have been misstated or suppressed; but many of\r\nus have had experience of the latter--of those visions of the night\r\nwhich have seemed so real, and which in some instances have brought us\r\ninformation as to occurrences before unknown to us, but subsequently\r\nproved to be true.\r\n\r\n\"George Benfield, a driver on the Midland Railway living at Derby, was\r\nstanding on the footplate oiling his engine, the train being stationary,\r\nwhen he slipped and fell on the space between the lines. He heard the\r\nexpress coming on, and had only just time to lie full length on the\r\n'six-foot' when it rushed by, and he escaped unhurt. He returned to his\r\nhome in the middle of the night, and as he was going up the stairs he\r\nheard one of his children, a girl about eight years old, crying and\r\nsobbing. 'Oh, Father!' she said, 'I thought somebody came and told me\r\nthat you were going to be killed, and I got out of bed and prayed that\r\nGod would not let you die.' Was it only a dream, a coincidence?\"\r\n\r\nDean Hole is the first person whom we remember to have held that a man's\r\ntestimony respecting a given species of experience is more credible if\r\nhe was asleep at the time that he claims to have had it, than if he was\r\nawake. He states that dreams \"in some instances have brought us\r\ninformation as to occurrences before unknown to us, but subsequently\r\nproved to be true,\" but the same is asserted in respect to waking\r\napparitional experiences on exactly as satisfactory evidence, in many\r\ncases. He accounts for the wonderful stories we hear in respect to\r\nwaking apparitions, and discredits them on exactly the same grounds that\r\nothers account for and discredit his dreams. The fact is that, with Dean\r\nHole as with many others, the personal equation is operative. He\r\nbelieves in coincidental dreams because he himself has experienced them\r\nand knows that he is not guilty of exaggerations in recounting them, nor\r\ncan he see how natural causes can explain them; he never has had a\r\nwaking apparition, and therefore is inclined to conjure up guesses as to\r\nthe inaccuracy and inveracity of those who have--guesses which he would\r\nresent if they were applied to himself.\r\n\r\nBut the Dean's testimony is one matter, his opinions or prejudices\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENTS REPORTED BY SERJEANT BALLANTINE\r\n\r\nSerjeant William Ballantine (1812-1887) was one of the foremost lawyers\r\nin England, noted for his skill in cross-examination. He was counsel in\r\nthe Tichborne claimant case, one of the most celebrated in the history\r\nof the English courts, and in the equally famed trial of the Gaekwar of\r\nBaroda. The incidents which impressed him are to be found in\r\nBallantine's _Some Experiences of a Barrister's Life_, pp. 256-267.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think it will be out of place whilst upon this subject to\r\nrelate a story told of Sir Astley Cooper.[22] I am not certain that it\r\nhas not been already in print, but I know that I have had frequent\r\nconversations about it with his nephew.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Sir Astley Paston Cooper was perhaps the most famous and\r\ninfluential surgeon of his time in England.]\r\n\r\n\"There had been a murder, and Sir Astley was upon the scene when a man\r\nsuspected of it was apprehended. Sir Astley, being greatly interested,\r\naccompanied the officers with their prisoner to the gaol, and he and\r\nthey and the accused were all in a cell, locked in together, when they\r\nnoticed a little dog which kept biting at the skirt of the prisoner's\r\ncoat. This led them to examine the garment, and they found upon it\r\ntraces of blood which ultimately led to conviction of the man. When they\r\nlooked around the dog had disappeared, although the door had never been\r\nopened. How it had got there or how it got away, of course nobody could\r\ntell. When Bransby Cooper spoke of this he always said that of course\r\nhis uncle had made a mistake, and was convinced of this himself; Bransby\r\nused to add that no doubt if the matter had been investigated it would\r\nhave been shown that there was a mode of accounting for it from natural\r\ncauses. But I believe that neither Sir Astley nor his nephew in their\r\nhearts discarded entirely the supernatural.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ballantine added an incident which some may think is accounted for\r\nby a telepathic impression followed by auto-suggestion which lowered the\r\nmental alertness of the player.\r\n\r\n\"There was a member of the club, a very harmless, inoffensive man of the\r\nname of Townend, for whom Lord Lytton [the novelist] entertained a\r\nmortal antipathy, and would never play whilst that gentleman was in the\r\nroom. He firmly believed that he brought him bad luck. I was witness to\r\nwhat must be termed an odd coincidence. One afternoon, when Lord Lytton\r\nwas playing and had enjoyed an uninterrupted run of luck, it suddenly\r\nturned, upon which he exclaimed, 'I am sure that Mr. Townend has come\r\ninto the club.' Some three minutes after, just time enough to ascend the\r\nstairs, in walked that unlucky personage. Lord Lytton as soon as the\r\nrubber was over, left the table and did not renew the play.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON'S PREMONITION BY APPARITION\r\n\r\nThis eminent dramatist, contemporary of Shakespeare (1573?-1637),\r\nvisited the Scottish poet, William Drummond, who took notes of his\r\nconversations which he afterwards published in the form of a book. One\r\nincident which Jonson related and Drummond recorded may be found in _The\r\nLibrary of the World's Best Literature_ under the title, _Ben Jonson_.\r\n\r\n\"At that tyme the pest was in London; he being in the country--with old\r\nCambden, he saw in a vision his eldest sone, then a child and at London,\r\nappear unto him with the mark of a bloodie crosse in his forehead, as if\r\nit had been cutted with a shord, at which amazed he prayed unto God,\r\nand in the morning he came to Mr. Cambden's chamber to tell him; who\r\npersuaded him it was but ane apprehension of his fantasie, at which he\r\nsould not be disjected; in the mean tyme comes then letters from his\r\nwife of the death of that boy in plague. He appeared to him (he said) of\r\na manly shape, and of that grouth that he thinks he shall be at the\r\nresurrection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRUBINSTEIN'S DEATH COMPACT\r\n\r\nA pupil of Anton Rubinstein, the great pianist and composer (1829-1894),\r\ntells this story. It may be found in _Harper's Magazine_ for December,\r\n1912, under the title _A Girl's Recollections of Rubinstein_, by Lillian\r\nNichia.\r\n\r\n\"One wild, blustery night I found myself at dinner with Rubinstein, the\r\nweather being terrific even for St. Petersburg. The winds were howling\r\nround the house and Rubinstein, who liked to ask questions, inquired of\r\nme what they represented to my mind. I replied, 'The moaning of lost\r\nsouls.' From this a theological discussion followed.\r\n\r\n\"'There may be a future,' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'There is a future,' I cried, 'a great and beautiful future. If I die\r\nfirst I shall come to you and prove this.'\r\n\r\n\"He turned to me with great solemnity.\r\n\r\n\"'Good, Liloscha, that is a bargain; and I will come to you.'\r\n\r\n\"Six years later in Paris I woke one night with a cry of agony and\r\ndespair ringing in my ears, such as I hope may never be duplicated in\r\nmy lifetime. Rubinstein's face was close to mine, a countenance\r\ndistorted by every phase of fear, despair, agony, remorse and anger. I\r\nstarted up, turned on all the lights, and stood for a moment shaking in\r\nevery limb, till I put fear from me and decided it was merely a dream. I\r\nhad for the moment completely forgotten our compact. News is always late\r\nin Paris, and it was in _Le Petit Journal_, published in the afternoon,\r\nthat had the first account of his sudden death.\r\n\r\n\"Four years later, Teresa Carreno, who had just come from Russia and was\r\ntouring America--I had met her in St. Petersburg frequently at\r\nRubinstein's dinner-table--told me that Rubinstein died with a cry of\r\nagony impossible of description. I knew then that even in death\r\nRubinstein had kept, as he always did, his word.\"\r\n\r\nHere again, we are at liberty to accept the testimony regarding the\r\nremarkable and complex coincidence, and to disregard what is really an\r\nexpression of opinion in the last sentence. Whether Rubinstein\r\nremembered his compact in his dying hour, or the impression produced\r\nupon his far-away pupil was automatically produced by some obscure\r\ntelepathic process, the dying man having in his mind no conscious\r\nthought of his promise, or some intervening _tertium quid_ produced the\r\nimpression, could never be determined by this incident alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVISIONARY DREAM BY CHARLES DICKENS\r\n\r\nThis incident in the experience of Charles Dickens (1812-1870) is to be\r\nfound in the standard biography by Forster, III, pp. 484-5 (London,\r\n1874). On May 30, 1863, Dickens wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Here is a curious case at first-hand. On Thursday night in last week,\r\nbeing at my office here, I dreamed that I saw a lady in a red shawl with\r\nher back toward me (whom I supposed to be E--). On her turning round I\r\nfound that I didn't know her, and she said, 'I am Miss Napier.' All the\r\ntime I was dressing next morning I thought 'What a preposterous thing to\r\nhave so very distinct a dream about nothing!' and why Miss Napier?--for\r\nI never heard of any Miss Napier. That same Friday night I read. After\r\nthe reading, came into my retiring-room, Mary Boyle and her brother, and\r\nthe lady in the red shawl, whom they present as 'Miss Napier.' These are\r\nall the circumstances exactly told.\"\r\n\r\nI can imagine the late Professor Royce saying thirty years ago--for I\r\nmuch doubt if he would have said it twenty years later--\"In certain\r\npeople, under certain exciting circumstances, there occur what I shall\r\nhenceforth call _Pseudo-presentiments_, _i.e._, more or less\r\ninstantaneous hallucinations of memory, which make it seem to one that\r\nsomething which now excites or astonishes him has been prefigured in a\r\nrecent dream, or in the form of some other warning, although this\r\nseeming is wholly unfounded, and although the supposed prophecy really\r\nsucceeds its own fulfillment.\"\r\n\r\nApply this curious theory (which has probably not been urged for many\r\nyears) to the incident just cited, and see how loosely it fits. What was\r\nthere about three persons, one a stranger coming to Dickens after he had\r\nfinished a reading from his own works, to \"excite\" or \"astonish\" him,\r\nmake his brain whirl and bring about a hallucination of memory, an\r\nillusion of having dreamed it all before? It was the most commonplace\r\nevent to him. Besides, as in most such cases, he had the distinct\r\nrecollection of his thoughts about the dream after waking, thoughts\r\ninextricably interwoven with the acts performed while dressing! Besides,\r\na pseudo-presentiment should tally with the event as a reflection does\r\nwith the object, but in the dream Miss Napier introduced herself, while\r\nin reality she was introduced by another.",
