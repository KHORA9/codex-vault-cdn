They distinguish it not merely in comparison with any\r\nprevious century, but in comparison with all the centuries that have\r\npreceded, in regard to far-reaching intellectual acquisitions, and to\r\nmaterial achievements, which together have profoundly affected our ways\r\nof thinking and our habits of life. In the latter, the enormously\r\nincreased facilities of locomotion and international communication due\r\nto railways and steam navigation have wrought the greatest changes.\r\nThese inventions depending primarily upon that of the steam engine, this\r\nfirst claims our notice, although properly assignable to a period\r\npreceding our era by a few years. Again, much of our material\r\nadvancement is connected with improvements in the manufacture of iron\r\nand its applications in the form of steel, which have been especially\r\nthe work of the last half of the century. So great has been the progress\r\nin this department, that for the present edition it has been found\r\nnecessary to re-write altogether the article devoted to it. Our social\r\nconditions have also been greatly modified by the celerity of verbal\r\nintercourse afforded by the telegraph and the telephone, and these\r\ninventions have received appropriate notice in this work. In every\r\nbranch of science also we have reason to be proud of the discoveries our\r\nera can claim, for they vastly excel in number and are not inferior in\r\nrange to those of all the ages taken together. From so large a field,\r\nselection was of course necessary; and the instances selected have been\r\nthose which appeared to some extent typical, or those which seemed to\r\nhave the most direct bearing on the general advance of our time. The\r\ntopics comprise chiefly those great applications of mechanical\r\nengineering and arts, and of physical and chemical science, in which\r\nevery intelligent person feels concerned; while some articles are\r\ndevoted to certain purely scientific discoveries that have excited\r\ngeneral interest.\r\n\r\nThe author has aimed at giving a concise but clear description of the\r\nseveral subjects; and that without assuming on the part of the reader\r\nany knowledge not usually possessed by young persons of either sex who\r\nhave received an ordinary education. The design has been to treat the\r\nsubjects as familiarly as might be consistent with a desire to impart\r\nreal information; while the popular character of the book has not been\r\nconsidered a reason for regarding accuracy as unnecessary. On the\r\ncontrary, pains have been taken to consult the best authorities; and it\r\nis only because the sources of information to which the author is under\r\nobligation are so many, that he cannot acknowledge them in detail.\r\n\r\nThe present edition has been revised throughout, and such changes have\r\nbeen made as were required to bring the matter into accordance with the\r\nprogress that has taken place since this book was first published in\r\n1876. But details given in the former editions have at the same time\r\nbeen retained where they served to indicate the successive stages of\r\nimprovement. It would, for example, be impossible in a section on steam\r\nnavigation, to omit some notice of the _Great Eastern_, and therefore\r\nthe drawings and the account of the construction of that remarkable ship\r\nthat appeared in the first edition, have been left with but slight\r\nalterations in the present volume, although the vessel has since been\r\nbroken up. On the other hand, two sections are devoted to projects which\r\nthe XIXth century has not seen realised; but the XXth century will in\r\nall probability shortly witness the completion of one or other of the\r\ngreat canal schemes; and if the first submarine tunnel is destined not\r\nto be one connecting England with the Continent, it will be one uniting\r\nGreat Britain with her sister isle.\r\n\r\n      1899.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor permission to make use of illustrations in this volume the author’s\r\nand publishers’ thanks are due to the several proprietors of _The\r\nGraphic_ (for Plates I., XI., and XII.)—of _The Engineer_ (for sketch\r\ndesign of the Great Wheel, map and views of the Tower Bridge)—of _The\r\nScientific American_ (map of North Sea Canal); also to Mr. Walter B.\r\nBasset (for Plate V.)—to “The Cassier Magazine Company” (for Edison’s\r\nKinetographic Theatre and the Hotchkiss Gun)—to “The Century Company”\r\n(for portrait of M.

The whole history of\r\narts and inventions is a continued comment on this text; and since the\r\nknowledge can be obtained only by observation of Nature, it follows that\r\nScience, which is the exact and orderly summing-up of the results of\r\nsuch observation, must powerfully contribute to the well-being and\r\nprogress of mankind.\r\n\r\nSome of the services which have been rendered by science in promoting\r\nhuman welfare are thus enumerated by an eloquent writer: “It has\r\nlengthened life; it has mitigated pain; it has extinguished diseases; it\r\nhas increased the fertility of the soil; it has given new securities to\r\nthe mariner; it has furnished new arms to the warrior; it has spanned\r\ngreat rivers and estuaries with bridges of form unknown to our fathers;\r\nit has guided the thunderbolt innocuously from heaven to earth; it has\r\nlighted up the night with the splendour of the day; it has extended the\r\nrange of the human vision; it has multiplied the power of the human\r\nmuscles; it has accelerated motion; it has annihilated distance; it has\r\nfacilitated intercourse, correspondence, all friendly offices, all\r\ndispatch of business; it has enabled man to descend to the depths of the\r\nsea, to soar into the air, to penetrate securely into the noxious\r\nrecesses of the earth, to traverse the land in cars which whirl along\r\nwithout horses, to cross the ocean in ships which run ten knots an hour\r\nagainst the wind. These are but a part of its fruits, and of its\r\nfirst-fruits; for it is a philosophy which never rests, which has never\r\nattained, which is never perfect. Its law is progress. A point which\r\nyesterday was invisible is its goal to-day, and will be its\r\nstarting-point tomorrow.”—(MACAULAY).\r\n\r\nThus every new invention, every triumph of engineering skill, is the\r\nembodiment of some scientific idea; and experience has proved that\r\ndiscoveries in science, however remote from the interests of every-day\r\nlife they may at first appear, ultimately confer unforeseen and\r\nincalculable benefits on mankind. There is also a reciprocal action\r\nbetween science and its application to the useful purposes of life; for\r\nwhile no advance is ever made in any branch of science which does not\r\nsooner or later give rise to a corresponding improvement in practical\r\nart, so on the other hand every advance made in practical art furnishes\r\nthe best illustration of scientific principles.\r\n\r\nThe enormous material advantages which this age possesses, the cheapness\r\nof production that has placed comforts, elegancies, and refinements\r\nunknown to our fathers within the reach of the humblest, are traceable\r\nin a high degree to the arrangement called the “division of labour,” by\r\nwhich it is found more advantageous for each man to devote himself to\r\none kind of work only; to the steam engine and its numerous\r\napplications; to increased knowledge of the properties of metals, and of\r\nthe methods of extracting them from their ores; to the use of powerful\r\nand accurate tools; and to the modern plan of manufacturing articles by\r\nprocesses of copying, instead of fashioning everything anew by manual\r\nlabour. Little more than a century ago everything was slowly and\r\nimperfectly made by the tedious toil of the workman’s hand; but now\r\nmarvellously perfect results of ingenious manufacture are in every-day\r\nuse, scattered far and wide, so that their very commonness almost\r\nprevents us from viewing them with the attention and admiration they\r\ndeserve. Machinery, actuated by the forces of nature, now performs with\r\nease and certainty work that was formerly the drudgery of thousands.\r\nEvery natural agent has been pressed into man’s service: the winds, the\r\nwaters, fire, gravity, electricity, light itself.\r\n\r\nBut so much have these things become in the present day matters of\r\ncourse, that it is difficult for one who has not witnessed the\r\nrevolution produced by such applications of science to realize their\r\nfull importance. Let the young reader who wishes to understand why the\r\npresent epoch is worthy of admiration as a stage in the progress of\r\nmankind, address himself to some intelligent person old enough to\r\nremember the century in its teens; let him inquire what wonderful\r\nchanges in the aspect of things have been comprised within the\r\nexperience of a single lifetime, and let him ask what has brought about\r\nthese changes. He will be told of the railway, and the steam-ship, and\r\nthe telegraph, and the great guns, and the mighty ships of war—\r\n\r\n              “The armaments which thunderstrike the walls\r\n              Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,\r\n              And monarchs tremble in their capitals.”\r\n\r\nHe will be told of a machine more potent in shaping the destinies of our\r\nrace than warlike engines—the steam printing-press. He may hear of a\r\nchemistry which effects endless and marvellous transformations; which\r\nfrom dirt and dross extracts fragrant essences and dyes of resplendent\r\nhue. He may hear something of a wonderful instrument which can make a\r\nfaint beam of light, reaching us after a journey of a thousand years,\r\nunfold its tale and reveal the secrets of the stars. Of these and of\r\nother inventions and discoveries which distinguish the present age it is\r\nthe purpose of this work to give some account.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES WATT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             STEAM ENGINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo track the steps which led up to the invention of the Steam Engine,\r\nand fully describe the improvements by which the genius of the\r\nillustrious Watt perfected it at least in principle, are not subjects\r\nfalling within the province of this work, which deals only with the\r\ndiscoveries and inventions of the present century. But as it does enter\r\ninto our province to describe some of the more recent developments of\r\nWatt’s invention, it may be desirable to give the reader an idea of his\r\nengine, of which all the more recent applications of steam are\r\nmodifications, with improvements of detail rather than of principle.\r\n\r\nWatt took up the engine in the condition in which it was left by\r\nNewcomen; and what that was may be seen in Fig. 2, which represents\r\nNewcomen’s atmospheric engine—the first practically useful engine in\r\nwhich a piston moving in a cylinder was employed. In the cut, the lower\r\npart of the cylinder, _c_, is removed, or supposed to be broken off, in\r\norder that the piston, _h_, and the openings of the pipes, _d_, _e_,\r\n_f_, connected with the cylinder, may be exhibited. The steam was\r\nadmitted beneath the piston by the attendant turning the cock _k_, and\r\nas the elastic force of the steam was only equal to the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, it was not employed to raise the piston, but merely filled\r\nthe cylinder, the ascent of the piston being caused by the weight\r\nattached to the other side of the beam, which at the same time sent down\r\nthe pump-rod, _m_; and when this was at its lowest position, the piston\r\nwas nearly at the top of the cylinder, which was open. The attendant\r\nthen cut off the communication with the boiler by closing the cock, _k_,\r\nat the same time opening another cock which allowed a jet of cold water\r\nfrom the cistern, _g_, to flow through the opening, _d_, into the\r\ncylinder. The steam which filled the cylinder was, by contact with the\r\ncold fluid, instantly condensed into water; and as the liquefied steam\r\nwould take up little more than a two-thousandth part of the space it\r\noccupied in the gaseous state, it followed that a vacuum was produced\r\nwithin the cylinder; and the weight of the atmosphere acting on the top\r\nof the piston, having no longer the elastic force of the steam to\r\ncounteract it, forced the piston down, and thus raised the pump-bucket\r\nattached to the rod, _m_. The water which entered the cylinder from the\r\ncistern, together with that produced by the condensation of the steam,\r\nflowed out of the cylinder by the opening, _f_, the pipe from which was\r\nconducted downwards, and terminated under water, the surface of which\r\nwas at least 34 ft. below the level of the cylinder; for the atmospheric\r\npressure would cause the cylinder to be filled with water had the height\r\nbeen less. The improvements which Watt, reasoning from scientific\r\nprinciples, was enabled to effect on the rude engine of Newcomen, are\r\nwell expressed by himself in the specification of his patent of 1769. It\r\nwill be observed that the machine was formerly called the “fire engine.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.—_Newcomen’s Steam Engine._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.—_Watt’s Double-action Steam Engine._\r\n]\r\n\r\n“My method of lessening the consumption of steam, and consequently\r\nfuel, in fire engines, consists of the following principles:—_First._\r\nThat vessel in which the powers of steam are to be employed to work\r\nthe engine (which is called the cylinder in common fire engines, and\r\nwhich I call the steam-vessel), must, during the whole time the engine\r\nis at work, be kept as hot as the steam that enters it; first, by\r\nenclosing it in a case of wood, or any other materials that transmit\r\nheat slowly; secondly, by surrounding it with steam or other heated\r\nbodies; and thirdly, by suffering neither water nor any other\r\nsubstance colder than the steam to enter or touch it during that\r\ntime.—_Secondly._ In engines that are to be worked either wholly or\r\npartially by condensation of steam, the steam is to be condensed in\r\nvessels distinct from the steam-vessels or cylinders, although\r\noccasionally communicating with them,—these vessels I call condensers;\r\nand whilst the engines are working, these condensers ought to be kept\r\nat least as cold as the air in the neighbourhood of the engines by the\r\napplication of water or other cold bodies.—_Thirdly._ Whatever air or\r\nother elastic vapour is not condensed by the cold of the condenser,\r\nand may impede the working of the engine, is to be drawn out of the\r\nsteam-vessels or condensers by means of pumps, wrought by the engines\r\nthemselves or otherwise.—_Fourthly._ I intend in many cases to employ\r\nthe expansive force of steam to press on the pistons, or whatever may\r\nbe used instead of them, in the same manner in which the pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere is now employed in common fire engines. In cases where\r\ncold water cannot be had in plenty, the engines may be wrought by this\r\nforce of steam only, by discharging the steam into the air after it\r\nhas done its office.—_Lastly._ Instead of using water to render the\r\npistons and other parts of the engines air- and steam-tight, I employ\r\noils, wax, resinous bodies, fat of animals, quicksilver, and other\r\nmetals in their fluid state.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—_Governor and Throttle-Valve._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the engraving we give of Watt’s double-action steam engine, Fig. 3,\r\nand the following description, the reader will realize the high degree\r\nof perfection to which the steam engine was brought by Watt. The steam\r\nis conveyed to the cylinder through a pipe, B, the supply being\r\nregulated by the throttle-valve, acted on by rods connected with the\r\ngovernor, D, which has a rotary motion. This apparatus is designed to\r\nregulate the admission of steam in such a manner that the speed of the\r\nengine shall be nearly uniform; and the mode in which this is\r\naccomplished may be seen in Fig. 4, where D D is a vertical axis\r\ncarrying the pulley, _d_, which receives a rotary motion from the\r\ndriving-shaft of the engine, by a band not shown in the figures. Near\r\nthe top of the axis, at _e_, two bent rods work on a pin, crossing each\r\nother in the same manner as the blades of a pair of scissors. The two\r\nheavy balls are attached to the lower arms of these levers, which move\r\nin slits through the curved guides intended to keep them always in the\r\nsame vertical plane as the axis, D D. The upper arms are jointed at _f\r\nf_ to rods hinged at _h h_ to a ring not attached to the axis, but\r\nallowing it to revolve freely within it. To this ring at F is fastened\r\none end of the lever connected with the throttle-valve in a manner\r\nsufficiently obvious from the cut. The position represented is that\r\nassumed by the apparatus when the engine is in motion, the disc-valve,\r\n_z_, being partly open. If from any cause the velocity of the engine\r\nincreases, the balls diverge from increased centrifugal force, and the\r\neffect is to draw down the ring at F, and, through the system of levers,\r\nto turn the disc in the direction of the arrows, and diminish the supply\r\nof steam. If, on the other hand, the speed of the engine is checked, the\r\nballs fall towards the axis, and the valve is opened wider, admitting\r\nsteam more freely, and so restoring its former speed to the engine. On\r\none side of the cylinder are two hollow boxes, E E, Fig. 3,\r\ncommunicating with the cylinder by an opening near the middle of the\r\nbox. Each of these steam-chests is divided into three compartments by\r\nconical valves attached to rods connected with the lever, H. These\r\nvalves are so arranged that when the upper part of the cylinder is in\r\ncommunication with the boiler, the lower part is open to the condenser,\r\nI, and _vice versâ_. The top of the cylinder is covered, and the\r\npiston-rod passes through an air and steam-tight hole in it; freedom of\r\nmotion, with the necessary close fitting, being attained by making the\r\npiston-rod pass through a _stuffing-box_, where it is closely surrounded\r\nwith greased tow. The piston is also packed, so that, while it can slide\r\nfreely up and down in the cylinder, it divides the latter into two\r\nsteam-tight chambers. In an engine of this kind, the elastic force of\r\nthe steam acts alternately on the upper and lower surfaces of the\r\npiston; and the condenser, by removing the steam which has performed its\r\noffice, leaves a nearly empty space before the piston, in which it\r\nadvances with little or no resistance. On the rod which works the\r\nair-pump, two pins are placed, so as to move the lever, H, up and down\r\nthrough a certain space, when one pin is near its highest and the other\r\nnear its lowest position, and thus the valves are opened and closed when\r\nthe piston reaches the termination of its stroke. In the condenser, I, a\r\nstream of cold water is constantly playing, the flow being regulated by\r\nthe handle, _f_. The steam, in condensing, heats the cold water, adding\r\nto its bulk, and at the same time the air, which is always contained in\r\nwater, is disengaged, owing to the heat and the reduced pressure. Hence\r\nit is necessary to pump out both the air and the water by the pump, J,\r\nwhich is worked by the beam of the engine. In his engines Watt adopted\r\nthe heavy fly-wheel, which tends to equalize the movement, and render\r\ninsensible the effects of those variations in the driving power and in\r\nthe resistance which always occur. In the action of the engine itself\r\nthere are two positions of the piston, namely, where it is changing its\r\ndirection, in which there is no force whatever communicated to the\r\npiston-rod by the steam. These positions are known as the “dead points,”\r\nand in a rotatory engine occur twice in each revolution. The resistance\r\nalso is liable to great variations. Suppose, for example, that the\r\nengine is employed to move the shears by which thick plates of iron are\r\ncut. When a plate has been cut, the resistance is removed, and the speed\r\nof the engine increases; but this increase, instead of taking place by a\r\nsudden start, takes place gradually, the power of the engine being in\r\nthe meantime absorbed in imparting increased velocity to the fly-wheel.\r\nWhen another plate is put between the shears, the power which the\r\nfly-wheel has gathered up is given out in the slight diminution of its\r\nspeed occasioned by the increased resistance. But for the fly-wheel,\r\nsuch changes of velocity would take place with great suddenness, and the\r\nshocks and strains thereby caused would soon injure the machine. This\r\nexpedient, in conjunction with that admirable contrivance, the\r\n“governor,” renders it possible to set the same engine at one moment to\r\nforge an anchor, and at the next to shape a needle. One of the most\r\ningenious of Watt’s improvements is what is termed the “parallel\r\nmotion,” consisting of a system of jointed rods connecting the head of\r\nthe piston-rod, R, with the end of the oscillating beam. As, during the\r\nmotion of the engine, the former moves in a straight line, while the\r\nlatter describes a circle, it would be impossible to connect them\r\ndirectly. Watt accomplished this by hinging rods together in form of a\r\nparallelogram, in such a manner that, while three of the angles describe\r\ncircles, the fourth moves in nearly a straight line. Watt was himself\r\nsurprised at the regularity of the action. “When I saw it work for the\r\nfirst time, I felt truly all the pleasure of novelty, _as if I was\r\nexamining the invention of another man_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A B is half the beam, A being the main centre; B E, the main links,\r\n    connecting the piston-rod, F, with the end of the beam; G D, the\r\n    air-pump links, from the centre of which the air-pump-rod is\r\n    suspended; C D moves about the fixed centre, C, while D E is movable\r\n    about the centre D, itself moving in an arc, of which C is the\r\n    centre. The dotted lines show the position of the links and bars\r\n    when the beam is at its highest position.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4_a_.—_Watt’s Parallel Motion._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany improvements in the details and fittings of almost every part of\r\nthe steam engine have been effected since Watt’s time. For example, the\r\nopening and closing of the passages for the steam to enter and leave the\r\ncylinder is commonly effected by means of the slide-valve (Fig. 5). The\r\nsteam first enters a box, in which are three holes placed one above the\r\nother in the face of the box opposite to the pipe by which the steam\r\nenters. The uppermost hole is in communication with the upper part of\r\nthe cylinder, and the lowest with the lower part. The middle opening\r\nleads to the condenser, or to the pipe by which the steam escapes into\r\nthe air. A piece of metal, which may be compared to a box without a lid,\r\nslides over the three holes with its open side towards them, and its\r\nsize is such that it can put the middle opening in communication with\r\neither the uppermost or the lowest opening, at the same time giving free\r\npassage for the steam into the cylinder by leaving the third opening\r\nuncovered. In A, Fig. 5, the valve is admitting steam below the piston,\r\nwhich is moving upwards, the steam which had before propelled it\r\ndownwards now having free exit. When the piston has arrived at the top\r\nof the cylinder, the slide is pushed down by the rod connecting it with\r\nthe eccentric into the position represented at B, and then the opposite\r\nmovement takes place. The slide-valve is not moved, like the old pot-lid\r\nvalves, against the pressure of the steam, and has other advantages,\r\namongst which may be named the readiness with which a slight\r\nmodification renders it available for using the steam “_expansively_.”\r\nThis expansive working was one of Watt’s inventions, but has been more\r\nlargely applied in recent times. In this plan, when the piston has\r\nperformed a part of its stroke, the steam is shut off, and the piston is\r\nthen urged on by the expansive force of the steam enclosed in the\r\ncylinder. Of course as the steam expands its pressure decreases; but as\r\nthe same quantity of steam performs a much larger amount of work when\r\nused expansively, this plan of cutting off the steam is attended with\r\ngreat economy. It is usually effected by the modification of the\r\nslide-valve, shown at C, Fig. 5, where the faces of the slides are made\r\nof much greater width than the openings. This excess of width is called\r\nthe “_lap_,” and by properly adjusting it, the opening into the cylinder\r\nmay be kept closed during the interval required, so that the steam is\r\nnot allowed to enter the cylinder after a certain length of the stroke\r\nhas been performed. The slide-valve is moved by an arrangement termed\r\nthe eccentric. A circular disc of metal is carried on the shaft of the\r\nengine, and revolves with it. The axis of the shaft does not, however,\r\nrun through the centre of the disc, but towards one side. The disc is\r\nsurrounded by a ring, to which it is not attached, but is capable of\r\nturning round within it. The ring forms part of a triangular frame to\r\nwhich is attached one arm of a lever that communicates the motion to the\r\nrod bearing the slide. Expansive working is often employed in\r\nconjunction with _superheated steam_, that is, steam heated out of\r\ncontact with water, after it has been formed, so as to raise its\r\ntemperature beyond that merely necessary to maintain it in the state of\r\nsteam, and to confer upon it the properties of a perfect gas. Experience\r\nhas proved that an increased efficiency is thus obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.—_Slide Valve._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe actual power of a steam engine is ascertained by an instrument\r\ncalled the Indicator, which registers the amount of pressure exerted by\r\nthe steam on the face of the piston in every part of its motion. The\r\nindicator consists simply of a very small cylinder, in which works a\r\npiston, very accurately made, so as to move up and down with very little\r\nfriction. The piston is attached to a strong spiral spring, so that when\r\nthe steam is admitted into the cylinder of the indicator the spring is\r\ncompressed, and its elasticity resists the pressure of the steam, which\r\ntends to force the piston up. When the pressure of steam below the\r\npiston of the indicator is equal to that of the atmosphere, the spring\r\nis neither compressed nor extended; but when the steam-pressure falls\r\nbelow that of the atmosphere, as it does while the steam is being\r\ncondensed, then the atmospheric pressure forces down the piston of the\r\nindicator until it is balanced by the tension of the now stretched\r\nspring. The extension or compression of the spring thus measures the\r\ndifference between the pressure of the atmosphere and that of the steam\r\nin the cylinder of the engine, with which the cylinder of the indicator\r\nfreely communicates.\r\n\r\nFrom the piston-rod of the indicator a pencil projects horizontally, and\r\nits point presses against a sheet of paper wound on a drum, which moves\r\nabout a vertical axis. This drum is made to move backwards and forwards\r\nthrough a part of a revolution, so that its motion may exactly\r\ncorrespond with that of the piston in the cylinder of the steam engine.\r\nThus, if the piston of the indicator were to remain stationary, a level\r\nline would be traced on the paper by the movement of the drum; and if\r\nthe latter did not move, but the steam were admitted to the indicator,\r\nthe pencil would mark an upright straight line on the paper. The actual\r\nresult is that a figure bounded by curved lines is traced on the paper,\r\nand the curve accurately represents the pressure of the steam at every\r\npoint of the piston’s motion. The position of the point of the pencil\r\nwhich corresponds with each pound of pressure per square inch is found\r\nby trial by the maker of the instrument, who attaches a scale to show\r\nwhat pressures of steam are indicated.\r\n\r\nIf the pressure per square inch is known, it is plain that by\r\nmultiplying that pressure by the number of square inches in the area of\r\nthe piston of the engine, the total pressure on the piston can be found.\r\nThe pressure does not rise instantly when the steam is first admitted,\r\nnor does it fall quite abruptly when the steam is cut off and\r\ncommunication opened with the condenser. When the steam is worked\r\nexpansively, the pressure falls gradually from the time the steam is\r\nshut off. Now, the amount of work done by any force is reckoned by the\r\npressure it exerts multiplied into the space through which that pressure\r\nis exerted. Therefore the work done by the steam is known by multiplying\r\nthe pressure in pounds on the whole surface of the piston into the\r\nlength in feet of the piston’s motion through which that pressure is\r\nexerted. The trace of the pencil on the paper—_i.e._, the _indicator\r\ndiagram_—shows the pressures, and also the length of the piston’s path\r\nthrough which each pressure is exerted, and therefore it is not\r\ndifficult to calculate the actual work which is done by the steam at\r\nevery stroke of the engine. If this be multiplied by the number of\r\nstrokes per minute, and the product divided by 33,000, we obtain what is\r\ntermed the _indicated horse-power_ of the engine. The work done per\r\nminute is divided by 33,000, because that number is taken to represent\r\nthe work that a horse can do in a minute: that is, the average work done\r\nin one minute by a horse would be equal to the raising of the weight of\r\n1,000 lbs. thirty-three feet high, or the raising of thirty-three pounds\r\n1,000 feet high. The number, 33,000, as expressing the work that could\r\nbe done by a horse in one minute, was fixed on by Watt, but more recent\r\nexperiments have shown that he over-estimated the power of horses, and\r\nthat we should have to reduce this number by about one-third if we\r\ndesire to express the actual average working power of a horse. But the\r\npower of engines having come to be expressed by stating the horse-power\r\non Watt’s standard, engineers have kept to the original number, which\r\nis, however, to be considered as a merely artificial unit or term of\r\ncomparison between one engine and another; for the power of a horse to\r\nperform work will vary with the mode in which its strength is exerted.\r\nThe source of the power which does the work in the steam engine is the\r\ncombustion of the coal in the furnace under the boiler. The amount of\r\nwork a steam engine will do depends not only on the quantity of steam\r\nwhich is generated in a given time, but also upon the pressure, and\r\ntherefore the temperature at which the steam is formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.—_Section of Giffard’s Injector._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe water constantly evaporating in the boiler of a steam engine is\r\nusually renewed by forcing water into the boiler against the pressure of\r\nthe steam by means of a small pump worked by the engine. In the\r\nengraving of Watt’s engine this pump is shown at M. But recently the\r\nfeed-pump has been to a great extent superseded by a singular apparatus\r\ninvented by M. Giffard, and known as Giffard’s Injector. In this a jet\r\nof steam from the boiler itself supplies the means of propelling a\r\nstream of water directly into the boiler. Fig. 6 is a section of this\r\ninteresting apparatus through its centre, and it clearly shows the\r\nmanner in which the current of steam is made to operate on the jet of\r\nwater. The steam from the boiler passes through the pipe A and into the\r\ntube B through the holes. The nozzle of this tube is of a conical shape,\r\nand its centre is occupied by a rod pointed to fit into the conical\r\nnozzle, and provided with a screw at the other end, so that the opening\r\ncan be regulated by turning the handle, C. At D the jet of steam comes\r\nin contact with the water which feeds the boiler, the arrangement being\r\nsuch that the steam is driven into the centre of the stream of water\r\nwhich enters by the pipe E, and is propelled by the steam jet through\r\nanother cone, F, issuing with such force from the orifice of the latter\r\nthat it is carried forward through the small opening at G into the\r\nchamber H. Here the water presses on the valve K, which it raises\r\nagainst the pressure of the steam and enters the boiler. The water\r\nissuing from the cone, F, actually traverses an open space which is\r\nexposed to the air, and where the fluid may be seen rushing into the\r\nboiler as a clear jet, except a few beads of steam which may be carried\r\nforward in the centre, the rest of the steam having been condensed by\r\nthe cold water. The steam, of course, rushes from the cone, B D, with\r\nenormous velocity, which is partly communicated to the water. The pipe,\r\nL, is for the water which overflows in starting the apparatus, until the\r\npressure in H becomes great enough to open the valve. The supplies of\r\nwater and of steam have to be adjusted according to the conditions of\r\npressure in the boiler, and according to the temperature of the\r\nfeed-water. It is found that when the feed-water is at a temperature\r\nabove 120° Fahrenheit, the injector will not work: the condensation of\r\nthe steam is therefore necessary to the result. For, as the steam is\r\ncontinually condensed by the cold water, it rushes from D with the same\r\nvelocity as into a vacuum, and the water is urged on by a momentum due\r\nto this velocity. We must observe, moreover, that the net result of the\r\noperation is a lessening of the pressure in the boiler; for the entrance\r\nof the feed-water produces a fall of temperature in the boiler, and the\r\nbulk of steam expended is fourteen times the bulk of the water injected:\r\nthus, although the apparatus before actual trial would not appear likely\r\nto produce the required result, the effect is no more paradoxical than\r\nin the case of the feed-pump. The injector has been greatly improved by\r\nMr. Gresham, who has contrived to make some of the adjustments\r\nself-acting, and his form of the apparatus is now largely used in this\r\ncountry. The injector is applicable to stationary, locomotive, or marine\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nSteam boilers are now always provided with one of _Bourdon’s_ gauges,\r\nfor indicating the pressure of the steam. The construction of the\r\ninstrument will easily be understood by an examination of Fig. 7. The\r\ngauge is screwed into some part of the boiler, where it can always be\r\nseen by the person in charge. The stop-cock A communicates with the\r\ncurved metallic tube C, which is the essential part of the contrivance.\r\nThis tube is of the flattened form shown at D, having its greatest\r\nbreadth perpendicular to the plane in which the tube is curved, and it\r\nis closed at the end E, where it is attached to the rod F, so that any\r\nmovement of E causes the axle carrying the index-finger, F, to turn, and\r\nthe index then moves along the graduated arc. The connection is\r\nsometimes made by wheelwork, instead of by the simple plan shown in the\r\nfigure. The front plate is represented as partly broken away, in order\r\nto show the internal arrangement, which, of course, is not visible in\r\nthe real instrument, where only the index-finger and graduated scale are\r\nseen, protected by a glass plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.—_Bourdon’s Pressure Gauge._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen a curved tube of the shape here described is subjected to a greater\r\npressure on the inside than on the outside, it tends to become\r\nstraighter, and the end E moves outward; but when the pressure is\r\nremoved, the tube resumes its former shape. The graduations on the scale\r\nare made by marking the position of the index when known pressures are\r\napplied. The amounts of pressure, when the gauges are being graduated,\r\nare known by the compression produced in air contained in another\r\napparatus. Gauges constructed on Bourdon’s principle are applied to\r\nother purposes, and can be made strong enough to measure very great\r\npressures, such as several thousand pounds on the square inch; they may\r\nalso be made so delicate as to measure variations of pressure below that\r\nof the atmosphere. The simplicity and small size of these gauges, and\r\nthe readiness with which they can be attached, render them most\r\nconvenient instruments wherever the pressure of a gas or liquid is\r\nrequired to be known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.—_Steam Generator._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA point to which great attention has been directed of late years is the\r\nconstruction of a boiler which shall secure the greatest possible\r\neconomy in fuel. Of the total heat which the fuel placed in the furnace\r\nis capable of supplying by its combustion, part may be wasted by an\r\nincomplete burning of the fuel, producing cinders or smoke or unburnt\r\ngases, another part is always lost by radiation and conduction, and a\r\nthird portion is carried off by the hot gases that escape from the\r\nboiler-flues. Many contrivances have been adopted to diminish as much as\r\npossible this waste of heat, and so obtain the greatest possible\r\nproportion of available steam power from a given weight of fuel. Boilers\r\nwholly or partially formed of tubes have recently been much in favour.\r\nAn arrangement for quickly generating and superheating steam is shown in\r\nFig. 8, in connection with a high-pressure engine.\r\n\r\nSteam engines are constructed in a great variety of forms, adapted to\r\nthe purposes for which they are intended. Distinctions are made\r\naccording as the engine is fitted with a condenser or not. When steam of\r\na low pressure is employed, the engine always has a condenser, and as in\r\nthis way a larger quantity of work is obtainable for a given weight of\r\nfuel, all marine engines—and all stationary engines, where there is an\r\nabundant supply of water and the size is not objectionable—are provided\r\nwith condensers. High-pressure steam may be used with condensing\r\nengines, but is generally employed in non-condensing engines only, as in\r\nlocomotives and agricultural engines, the steam being allowed to escape\r\ninto the air when it has driven the piston to the end of the stroke. In\r\nsuch engines the beam is commonly dispensed with, the head of the\r\npiston-rod moving between guides and driving the crank directly by means\r\nof a connecting-rod. The axis of the cylinder may be either vertical,\r\nhorizontal, or inclined. A plan often adopted in marine engines, by\r\nwhich space is saved, consists in jointing the piston-rod directly to\r\nthe crank, and suspending the cylinder on trunnions near the middle of\r\nits length. The trunnions are hollow, and are connected by steam-tight\r\njoints, one with the steam-pipe from the boiler, and the other with the\r\neduction-pipe. Such engines have fewer parts than any others; they are\r\nlighter for the same strength, and are easily repaired. The trunnion\r\njoints are easily packed, so that no leakage takes place, and yet there\r\nis so little friction that a man can with one hand move a very large\r\ncylinder, whereas in another form of marine engine, known as the\r\nside-lever engine, constructed with oscillating beams, the friction is\r\noften very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _THE LOCOMOTIVE._\r\n\r\nThe first locomotive came into practical use in 1804. Twenty years\r\nbefore, Watt had patented—but had not constructed—a locomotive engine,\r\nthe application of steam to drive carriages having first been suggested\r\nby Robinson in 1759. The first locomotives were very imperfect, and\r\ncould draw loads only by means of toothed driving-wheels, which engaged\r\nteeth in rack-work rails. The teeth were very liable to break off, and\r\nthe rails to be torn up by the pull of the engine. In 1813, the\r\nimportant discovery was made that such aids are unnecessary, for it was\r\nfound that the “bite” of a smooth wheel upon a smooth rail was\r\nsufficient for all ordinary purposes of traction. But for this\r\ndiscovery, the locomotive might never have emerged from the humble duty\r\nof slowly dragging coal-laden waggons along the tramways of obscure\r\ncollieries. The progress of the locomotive in the path of improvement\r\nwas, however, slow, until about 1825, when George Stephenson applied the\r\nblast-pipe, and a few years later adopted the tubular boiler. These are\r\nthe capital improvements which, at the famous trial of locomotives, on\r\nthe 6th of October, 1829, enabled Stephenson’s “Rocket” to win the prize\r\noffered by the directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The\r\n“Rocket” weighed 4½ tons, and at the trial drew a load of tenders and\r\ncarriages weighing 12¾ tons. Its average speed was 14 miles an hour, and\r\nits greatest, 29 miles an hour. This engine, the parent of the powerful\r\nlocomotives of the present day, may now be seen in the Patent Museum at\r\nSouth Kensington. Since 1829, numberless variations and improvements\r\nhave been made in the details of the locomotive. In weight, dimensions,\r\ntractive power and speed, the later locomotives vastly surpass the\r\nearlier types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—_Section of Locomotive_ (A.D. 1837).\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 9 represents the section of a locomotive constructed _c._ 1837. The\r\nboiler is cylindrical; and at one end is placed the fire-box, partly\r\nenclosed in the cylindrical boiler, and surrounded on all sides by the\r\nwater, except where the furnace door is placed, and at the bottom, where\r\nthe fuel is heaped up on bars which permit the cinders to drop out. At\r\nthe other end of the boiler, a space beneath the chimney called the\r\nsmoke-box is connected with the fire-box by a great number of brass\r\npipes, open at both ends, firmly fixed in the end plates of the boiler.\r\nThese tubes are from 1¼ in. to 2 in. in diameter, and are very\r\nnumerous—usually about one hundred and eighty, but sometimes nearly\r\ndouble that number. They therefore present a large heating surface to\r\nthe water, which stands at a level high enough to cover them all and the\r\ntop of the fire-box. The boiler of the locomotive is not exposed to the\r\nair, which would, if allowed to come in contact with it, carry off a\r\nlarge amount of heat. The outer surface is therefore protected from this\r\ncooling effect by covering it with a substance which does not permit the\r\nheat to readily pass through it. Nothing is found to answer better than\r\nfelt; and the boiler is accordingly covered with a thick layer of this\r\nsubstance, over which is placed a layer of strips of wood ¾ in. thick,\r\nand the whole is surrounded with thin sheet iron. It is this sheet iron\r\nalone that is visible on the outside. The level of the water in the\r\nboiler is indicated by a gauge, which is merely a very strong glass\r\ntube; and the water carried in the tender is forced in as required, by a\r\npump (not shown in the Fig.). The steam leaves the boiler from the upper\r\npart of the _steam-dome_, A, where it enters the pipe, B; the object\r\nbeing to prevent water from passing over with the steam into the pipe.\r\nThe steam passes through the _regulator_, C, which can be closed or\r\nopened to any extent required by the handle, D, and rushes along the\r\npipe, E, which is wholly within the boiler, but divides into two\r\nbranches when it reaches the smoke-box, in order to conduct the steam to\r\nthe cylinders. Of these there are two, one on each side, each having a\r\nslide-valve, by means of which the steam is admitted before and behind\r\nthe pistons alternately, and escapes through the blast-pipe, F, up the\r\nchimney, G, increasing the draught of the fire by drawing the flame\r\nthrough the longitudinal tubes in proportion to the rush of steam; and\r\nthus the rate of consumption of fuel adjusts itself to the work the\r\nengine is performing, even when the loads and speeds are very different.\r\nThough the plane of section passing through the centre of boiler would\r\nnot cut the cylinders, one of them is shown in section. H is the piston;\r\nK the connecting-rod jointed to the crank, L, the latter being formed by\r\nforging the axle with four rectangular angles, thus, __¦¯¯¦__; and the\r\ncrank bendings for the two cylinders are placed in planes at right\r\nangles to each other, so that when one is at the “dead point,” the other\r\nis in a position to receive the full power of the piston. There are two\r\nsafety valves, one at M, the other at N; the latter being shut up so\r\nthat it cannot be tampered with.\r\n\r\nLocomotives are fitted with an ingenious apparatus for reversing the\r\nengines, which was first adopted by the younger Stephenson, and is known\r\nas the “link motion.” The same arrangement is employed in other engines\r\nin which the direction of rotation has to be changed; and it serves\r\nanother important purpose, namely, to provide a means by which steam may\r\nbe employed expansively at pleasure. The link motion is represented in\r\nFig. 10, where A, B, are two eccentrics oppositely placed on the\r\ndriving-shaft, and their rods joined to the ends of the curved bar or\r\nlink, C D. A slit extends nearly the whole length of this bar, and in it\r\nworks the stud E, forming part of the lever, F, G, movable about the\r\nfixed joint, G, and having its extremity, F, jointed to the rod H, that\r\nmoves the slide-valve. The weight of the link and the eccentric rods is\r\ncounterpoised with a weight, K, attached to the lever, I K, which turns\r\non the fixed centre, L. This lever forms one piece with another lever, L\r\nM, with which it may be turned by pulling the handle of O P, connected\r\nwith it through the system of jointed rods. When the link is lowered, as\r\nshown in the figure, the slide-valve rod will follow the movement of the\r\neccentric, B, while the backward and forward movement of the other\r\neccentric will only be communicated to the end of C, and will scarcely\r\naffect the position of the stud E at all. By drawing the link up to its\r\nhighest position, the motion due to eccentric A only will be\r\ncommunicated to the slide-valve rod, which will therefore be drawn back\r\nat the part of the revolution where before it was pushed forward, and\r\n_vice versâ_; hence the engine will be reversed. When the link is so\r\nplaced that the stud is exactly in the centre, the slide-valve will\r\nreceive no motion, and remain in its middle position, consequently the\r\nengine is stopped. By keeping the link nearer or farther from its\r\ncentral position, the throw of the slide-valve will be shorter or\r\nlonger, and the steam will be shut off from entering the cylinder when a\r\nsmaller or larger portion of the stroke has been performed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.—_Stephenson’s Link Motion._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlthough Fig. 9 represents with sufficient clearness all the essential\r\nparts of a locomotive, it should be observed that as actually\r\nconstructed for use on the different lines of railway the machine is\r\ngreatly modified in the arrangement and proportions of its parts. A\r\ngreater number of adjuncts and subsidiary appliances are also provided\r\nfor the more effective and convenient working of the engine, and for\r\ngiving control over the movement of the train, and these, in fact,\r\nconduce much to the greater economy and safety with which trains are now\r\nrun. As the circumstances and conditions under which railways are worked\r\nvary much in different parts of the world, the locomotive has to be\r\ndesigned to meet the requirements of each case, and its general\r\nappearance, details and dimensions are accordingly much diversified.\r\nFrom among the many types of recent locomotives we select for\r\nillustration and a short description the form of express passenger\r\nengine that has lately been designed by Mr. T. W. Worsdell, the engineer\r\nof the North Eastern Railway, and this will give the opportunity of\r\nnoticing some of the newest improvements, which are embodied in this\r\nengine. See Plate II.\r\n\r\nThe plan of causing the steam to work expansively has already been\r\nmentioned on pages 8 and 9, as used by cutting off the steam when part\r\nof the stroke of the piston has been made. Another mode by which the\r\nexpansive principle has long been made use of in stationary and marine\r\nengines is to allow the steam from the boiler to enter first a smaller\r\ncylinder and from that, at the end of the stroke, to pass into a larger\r\none in which, as it expands, it exercises a diminished pressure. This\r\narrangement has been called the compound or double-cylinder engine, and\r\nwas known to possess certain advantages where high pressure steam was\r\nmade use of. Indeed, in marine engines the principle of “triple\r\nexpansion” is now quite commonly adopted—that is, the steam passes\r\nsuccessively into three cylinders of successively greater diameter. Mr.\r\nWebb, the locomotive engineer of the London and North Western Railway,\r\nappears to have been the first to make the “compounding” system a\r\npractical success as applied to the locomotive. In Mr. Webb’s\r\narrangement there are three cylinders, two smaller ones for the\r\nhigh-pressure steam from the boiler, and between these a single large\r\nlow-pressure cylinder which receives the steam that has done its work\r\nfrom both the smaller cylinders. In Mr. Worsdell’s engine the original\r\nand simpler locomotive construction of two cylinders has been adhered\r\nto, and thus the general plan of the engine is unchanged except in the\r\nlarger size of the low-pressure cylinder. In the present engine the\r\nstroke is 24 in.; the high-pressure cylinder has its internal diameter\r\n20 in. and the low-pressure cylinder a diameter of 28 in. The\r\nboiler-shell is made of steel, the fire-box is of copper, and there are\r\n203 brass tubes, 1¾ in. diameter and 10 ft. 11 in. long, connecting the\r\nfire-box with the smoke-box. The frame, and indeed most parts of the\r\nengine, are also made of steel. The driving-wheels, which here are a\r\nsingle pair, have a diameter of 7 ft. 7¼ in. The total “wheel-base” is\r\nnearly 21 ft., and it will be observed that the forepart of the engine\r\nis supported on a four-wheeled _bogie_. The _bogie_ is capable of a\r\ncertain amount of horizontal motion by turning round a swivel, but this\r\nmovement is controlled by springs, so that, notwithstanding the length\r\nof the frame, the engine is enabled to take curves with great facility,\r\nwhile its motion is perfectly steady even at the highest speeds. The\r\nworking pressure of the steam in the boiler is 170 lbs. on the square\r\ninch. The steam which leaves the high-pressure cylinder is conveyed to\r\nthe low-pressure cylinder by a pipe that is led round the inside of the\r\nsmoke-box, and thus enters the larger cylinder after taking up heat that\r\nwould otherwise be wasted, so that its elastic force is fully\r\nmaintained. This circumstance, no doubt, contributes to the very marked\r\neconomy of fuel that has been effected by the compound engines. How\r\ngreat the economy is found in the working will be seen by the following\r\nresults, which are taken from the actual records. The same train was\r\ntaken over the same rails in ordinary quick passenger traffic for\r\nseveral journeys which, as performed in the same time by the compound\r\nengine and by another otherwise similar non-compound engine, required\r\nfor the compound, 25,254 lbs. of coal; for the non-compound, 32,104\r\nlbs.; or, the consumption of coal by the former was 28 lbs. per mile; by\r\nthe latter, 36 lbs. per mile. This represents a saving of about 21 per\r\ncent. of the fuel. As the steam enters the high-pressure cylinder first,\r\nit would not be possible to start the engine if it had stopped at one of\r\nthe “dead-points” on that side, without a special arrangement for\r\nadmitting the steam directly to the other cylinder in such cases. This,\r\nof course, is required only for the first stroke, and Mr. Worsdell and\r\nM. von Borries have contrived for this purpose an ingenious valve,\r\nbrought into operation when required by a touch from the engineer, and\r\nthen immediately adjusting itself automatically, so as to restore the\r\nsteam connections to their normal condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE II.\r\n\r\n  NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY LOCOMOTIVE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10_a_.—_G.N.R. Express Passenger Locomotive._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother type of the high-speed passenger engines used for express trains\r\non several of the great English railways is well represented by one of\r\nthe Great Northern Company’s locomotives, as depicted in Fig. 10_a_. In\r\nthis there are a single pair of driving wheels of very large diameter,\r\nnamely, 8 ft. 2 in., so that each complete movement of the pistons will\r\ncarry the engine forwards a length of nearly 26 ft. There are outside\r\ncylinders, and therefore the driving axle is straight, and the leading\r\nwheels are in two pairs, mounted on a _bogie_ which is capable of a\r\ncertain amount of independent horizontal rotation.\r\n\r\nThe Stephenson’s link motion, described on page 17, has lately been\r\noften supplanted by another arrangement known as Joy’s valve gear, which\r\nleaves the crank axle unencumbered with eccentrics, and, as taking up\r\nless space, is generally now preferred for locomotives and also for\r\nmarine engines. Its principle is very simple, and will be readily\r\nunderstood from the diagram in Fig. 10_b_, where _c_ is the spindle of\r\nthe slide-valves as in Fig. 5, but capable, we shall now suppose, of a\r\nhorizontal movement only. Jointed to it at D is a rod D E attached to a\r\nblock at E, which can move only within a slot in the strong bar E F in a\r\ncircular segment, the centre of which is at D. The bar we suppose for\r\nthe moment to be immovable, and disposed symmetrically to C D. Now let\r\nan alternate up and down motion along the circular segment be given to\r\nblock E, and the effect will be to leave the centre, D, unchanged in\r\nposition, and, therefore, in that case the valve will not be moved at\r\nall. Now this reciprocating movement is given to the block E by a system\r\nof levers (not here shown), jointed to the connecting-rod (K, Fig. 9) in\r\nsuch a manner that the rod D E is compelled to follow the movement of\r\nthe connecting-rod, but the end E must always travel in the circular\r\nsegment. We have hitherto supposed this segmental piece to be fixed, but\r\nthe engineer has the power of so turning it as to tilt either the upper\r\nor lower part towards D. If, for instance, the guiding segment is fixed\r\nas at II, the block in rising will push in the valve-spindle, and in\r\ndescending draw it out, as the length of the rod D E is invariable. But\r\nif the guides be turned over so as to bring F nearer D than E, the same\r\nmovement of the block will give the reverse motions to the\r\nvalve-spindle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10_b_.—_Joy’s Valve Gear._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the great rapidity with which the machinery of the locomotive\r\nmoves, the different parts require to be carefully balanced in order to\r\nprevent dangerous oscillations. For example, the centrifugal force of\r\nthe massive cranks, etc., is balanced by inserting between the spokes of\r\nthe driving wheels certain counterpoises, the weights and positions of\r\nwhich are finally adjusted by trial. The engine is suspended by chains\r\nand set in motion, and a pencil attached to one corner of the frame\r\nmarks on a horizontal card the form of the oscillation, usually by an\r\noval figure. When the diameter of this figure is reduced to about 1/16\r\ninch, the adjustment is considered complete.\r\n\r\nThe power of a locomotive, of course, depends on the pressure of the\r\nsteam and the size of the cylinder, &c.; but a very much lower limit\r\nthan is imposed by these conditions is set to the power of the engine to\r\ndraw loads by the adhesion between the driving wheels and the rails. By\r\nthe term “adhesion,” which is commonly used in this case, nothing more\r\nis really meant than the friction between surfaces of iron. When the\r\nresistance of the load drawn is greater than this friction, the wheels\r\nturn round and slip on the rails without advancing. The adhesion depends\r\nupon the pressure between the surfaces, and upon their condition. It is\r\ngreater in proportion as the weight supported by the driving-wheels is\r\ngreater, and when the rails are clean and dry it is equal to from 15 to\r\n20 per cent. of that part of the weight of the engine which rests on the\r\ndriving-wheels; but when the rails are moist, or, as it is called,\r\n“greasy,” the tractive power may be only 5 per cent. of the weight;\r\nabout one-tenth may be taken as an average. Suppose that 30 tons of the\r\nweight of a locomotive are supported by the driving-wheels, that\r\nlocomotive could not be employed to drag a train of which the resistance\r\nwould cause a greater pull upon the coupling-links of the tender than\r\nthey would be subject to if they were used to suspend a weight of 3\r\ntons. The number of pairs of wheels in a locomotive varies from two to\r\nfive; most commonly there are three pairs; and one, two, or all, are\r\ndriven by the engine, the wheels being coupled accordingly; very often\r\ntwo pairs are coupled.\r\n\r\nThe pressure at which the steam is used in the locomotive is sometimes\r\nvery considerable. A pressure equal to 180 lbs. on each square inch of\r\nthe surface of the boiler is quite usual. The greater economy obtained\r\nby the employment of high-pressure steam acting expansively in the\r\ncylinder, points to the probability of much higher pressures being\r\nadopted. There is practically no limit but the power of the materials to\r\nresist enormous strains, and there is no reason, in the nature of\r\nthings, why steam of even 500 lbs. per square inch should not be\r\nemployed, if it were found otherwise desirable. It need hardly be said\r\nthat locomotives are invariably constructed of the very best materials,\r\nand with workmanship of the most perfect kind. The boilers are always\r\ntested, by hydraulic pressure, to several times the amount of the\r\nhighest pressure the steam is required to have, and great care is\r\nbestowed upon the construction of the safety-valves, so that the steam\r\nmay blow off when the due amount of pressure is exceeded. The explosion\r\nof a locomotive is, considering the number of engines in constant use, a\r\nvery rare occurrence, and is probably in all cases owing to the sudden\r\ngeneration of a large quantity of steam, and not to an excessive\r\npressure produced gradually. Among the causes capable of producing\r\nexplosive generation of steam may be mentioned the deposition of a hard\r\ncrust of stony matter, derived from the water; this crust allows the\r\nboiler to be over-heated, and if water should then find its way into\r\ncontact with the heated metal, a large quantity of steam will be\r\nabruptly generated. Or should the water in the boiler become too low,\r\nparts of the boiler may become so heated that on the admission of fresh\r\nwater it would be suddenly converted into steam. When an explosion does\r\ntake place, the enormous force of the agent we are dealing with when we\r\nbottle up steam in an iron vessel, is shown by the effects produced.\r\nFig. 11 is from a photograph taken from an exploded locomotive, where we\r\nmay see how the thick plates of iron have been torn like paper, and the\r\ntubes, rods, and levers of the engine twisted in inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—_Locomotive after Explosion._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.—_Hancock’s Steam Omnibus._\r\n]\r\n\r\nLocomotive engines for propelling carriages on common roads were\r\ninvented many years ago, by Gurney, Anderson, Scott Russell, Hancock,\r\nand others. One designed by Hancock is represented in Fig. 12. Such\r\nengines do not appear to have found much favour, though the idea has\r\nbeen successfully realized in the traction engines lately introduced.\r\nProbably the application of steam power to the propulsion of vehicles\r\nalong common roads fell into neglect on account of the superior\r\nadvantages of railways, but the common road locomotive is at present\r\nreceiving some attention. In the tramways which are now laid along the\r\nmain roads in most large cities we see one-half of the problem solved.\r\nIt is not so much mechanical difficulties that stand in the way of this\r\neconomical system of locomotion, as the prejudices and interests which\r\nhave always to be overcome before the world can profit by new\r\ninventions. The engines can be made noiseless, emitting no visible steam\r\nor smoke, and they are under more perfect control than horses. But\r\nvestries and parochial authorities offer such objections as that horses\r\nwould be frightened in the streets, if the engine made a noise; and if\r\nit did not, people would be liable to be run over, and the horses be as\r\nmuch startled as in the other case. But horses would soon become\r\naccustomed to the sight of a carriage moving without equine aid, however\r\nstartling the matter might appear to them at first; and the objection\r\nurged against the noiseless engines might be alleged against wooden\r\npavements, india-rubber tires, and many other improvements. It is highly\r\nprobable that in the course of a few years the general adoption of\r\nsteam-propelled vehicles will displace horses, at least upon tramways.\r\nThe slowness with which inventions of undeniable utility and of proved\r\nadvantage come into general use may be illustrated by the fact of some\r\ngreat English towns and centres of engineering industry not having made\r\na single tramway until, in all the populous cities of the United States,\r\nand in almost every European capital, tramways had been in successful\r\noperation for many years. [1890.]\r\n\r\nSome time has elapsed since the foregoing paragraph was written for an\r\nearlier edition of this work, and during that period there has been an\r\nadvance in both practice and opinion; so that now it has become highly\r\nprobable that before the century ends a great change may be witnessed in\r\nour modes of locomotion, even on ordinary roads. Already every town of\r\nimportance throughout the United Kingdom has been provided with\r\nexcellent tramways, along which, in not a few instances, horseless\r\nvehicles roll smoothly, to the great convenience of the general public,\r\nwhile not one of the difficulties and dangers to general street traffic\r\nhas been experienced that were so confidently predicted by those who\r\nwere unable to perceive that an innovation might be an improvement. The\r\nnow universally-popular bicycle has been continually receiving\r\nimprovements, of which there appears to be no end, and as the machine\r\nand all the contrivances connected with it are so familiar to everyone,\r\nthere is no need here to do more than to refer to them, because they\r\nhave led the way to great improvements in ordinary carriages.\r\n\r\nThe steam-propelled vehicle for common roads has just been mentioned as\r\nan invention belonging to the first half of the century, and the reasons\r\nit did not find favour have been alluded to. There exists in the United\r\nKingdom a law concerning horseless carriages travelling on highways,\r\nwhich was passed to apply to traction engines, and enacts that other\r\nthan horse vehicles are not to go along a road at a greater speed than\r\nfour miles an hour, and only two miles an hour through a town, and\r\nmoreover they are to be preceded by a man bearing a red flag, etc. But a\r\nbill has been introduced (1895) into the legislature to amend this law,\r\nand permit the British people to use on their common roads such light\r\nself-propelled carriages as are becoming popular in France, as may be\r\nseen from the following account:—\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, 11th June, 1895, a race was started from Versailles to\r\nBordeaux and back, a distance of 727 miles or more for the double\r\njourney. The first prize was the substantial sum of 40,000 francs\r\n(£1,600), to which was attached the condition of the carriage seating\r\nfour persons, and other prizes were also to be awarded to various kinds\r\nof automatic vehicles. No fewer than sixty-six vehicles were entered for\r\ncompetition, and these were variously supplied with motive power from\r\nsteam, electricity, or petroleum spirit. The starting place was\r\nVersailles at 12·9 p.m., and at 10·32 on Wednesday morning MM. Panhard &\r\nLevassor’s petroleum carriage arrived at Bordeaux, whence, after a stop\r\nof only four minutes, the return journey was begun, but shortly\r\nafterward an accident caused a delay of one hour, but the carriage made\r\nthe whole distance at the average of 14·9 miles per hour. In this and\r\nthree other carriages belonging to the same firm, the propeller was the\r\nDaimler motor. Though this carriage was the first to accomplish the trip\r\nit received only the second prize, the condition of seating _four_\r\npersons not having been complied with. The first prize fell to a\r\nfour-seated vehicle by Les Fils de Peugeot Frères, a firm who carried\r\noff besides the third and fourth prizes. These carriages were also\r\ndriven by so-called petroleum motors. These motors are really gas\r\nengines on the principle to be presently mentioned, but the gas is\r\nproduced by the vapourisation of a volatile constituent of petroleum\r\n(benzoline). The Daimler motor is a compact combination of two cylinders\r\nconnected with a chamber containing the explosive mixture of gas and\r\nair. The pistons perform their in and out strokes simultaneously, but\r\ntheir working strokes alternately.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _PORTABLE ENGINES._\r\n\r\nThe application of steam power to agricultural operations has led to the\r\nconstruction of engines specially adapted by their simplicity and\r\nportability for the end in view. The movable agricultural engines have,\r\nlike the locomotives, a fire-box nearly surrounded by the water, and\r\nhorizontal tubes, and are set on wheels, so that they may be drawn by\r\nhorses from place to place. There is usually one cylinder placed\r\nhorizontally on the top of the boiler; and the piston-rod, working in\r\nguides, is, as in the old locomotive, attached by a connecting-rod to\r\nthe crank of a shaft, which carries a fly-wheel, eccentrics, and pulleys\r\nfor belts to communicate the motion to the machines. Engines of this\r\nkind are also much used by contractors, for hoisting stones, mixing\r\nmortar, &c. These engines are made with endless diversities of details,\r\nthough in most such simplicity of arrangement is secured, that a\r\nlabourer of ordinary intelligence may, after a little instruction, be\r\ntrusted with the charge of the engine; while their economy of fuel,\r\nefficiency, and cheapness are not exceeded in any other class of steam\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nBesides the steam engines already described or alluded to, there are\r\nmany interesting forms of the direct application of steam power. There\r\nare, for example, the steam roller and the steam fire-engine. The former\r\nis a kind of heavy locomotive, moving on ponderous rollers, which\r\nsupport the greater part of the weight of the engine. When this machine\r\nis made to pass slowly over roads newly laid with broken stones, a few\r\nrepetitions of the process suffice to crush down the stones and\r\nconsolidate the materials, so as at once to form a smooth road. Steam\r\npower is applied to the fire engine, not to propel it through the\r\nstreets, but to work the pumps which force up the water. The boilers of\r\nthese engines are so arranged that in a few minutes a pressure of steam\r\ncan be obtained sufficient to throw an effective jet of water. The cut\r\nat the end of this chapter represents a very efficient engine of this\r\nkind, which will throw a jet 200 feet high, delivering 1,100 gallons of\r\nwater per minute. It has two steam cylinders and two pumps, each making\r\na stroke of two feet. These are placed horizontally, the pumps and the\r\nair reservoir occupying the front part of the engine, while the vertical\r\nboiler is placed behind. The steam cylinders, which are partly hid in\r\nthe cut by the iron frame of the engine, are not attached to the boiler,\r\nwhich by this arrangement is saved from injurious strains produced by\r\nthe action of the moving parts of the mechanism. There are seats for\r\neight firemen, underneath which is a space where the hose is carried. A\r\nfirst-class steam fire-engine of this kind, completely fitted, costs\r\nupwards of £1,300.\r\n\r\nA cheap and very convenient prime mover has lately come into use, which\r\nhas certain advantages over even the steam engine. Where a moderate or a\r\nvery small power is required, especially where it is used only at\r\nintervals, the _gas engine_ is found to be more convenient. It is small\r\nand compact, no boiler or furnace is required, and it can be started at\r\nany moment. As now made, it works smoothly and without noise. The piston\r\nis impelled, not by the expansive force of steam, but by that of heated\r\nair, the heat being generated by the explosion of a mixture of common\r\ncoal gas and air within the cylinder itself. Thus a series of small\r\nexplosions has the same effect as the admissions of steam through a\r\nvalve. A due quantity of gas and air is introduced into the cylinder,\r\nand is ignited by the momentary opening of a communication with a\r\nlighted gas jet outside. But the machine is provided with a regulator or\r\ngovernor, which so acts on the valve mechanism that this communication\r\nis made at each stroke only when the speed of rotation falls below a\r\ncertain assigned limit, and thus the number of the explosions is less\r\nthan the number of strokes, unless its work absorbs the machine’s whole\r\nenergy, which, according to the size of the engine, may be from that of\r\na child up to 30–horse power.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _THE STEAM HAMMER._\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of the steam hammer, large forge hammers had been\r\nin use actuated by steam, but in an indirect manner, the hammer having\r\nbeen lifted by cams and other expedients, which rendered the apparatus\r\ncumbersome, costly, and very wasteful of power, on account of the\r\nindirect way in which the original source of the force, namely, the\r\npressure of the steam, had to reach its point of application by giving\r\nthe blow to the hammer. Not only did the necessary mechanism for\r\ncommunicating the force in this roundabout manner interfere with the\r\nspace necessary for the proper handling of the article to be forged, but\r\nthe range of the fall of the hammer being only about 18 in., caused a\r\nvery rapid decrease in the energy of the blow when only a very\r\nmoderate-sized piece of iron was introduced. For example, a piece of\r\niron 9 in. in diameter reduced the fall of the mass forming the hammer\r\nto one-half, and the work it could accomplish was diminished in like\r\nproportion. Besides, as the hammer was attached to a lever working on a\r\ncentre, the striking face of the hammer was parallel to the anvil only\r\nat one particular point of its fall; and again, as the hammer was always\r\nnecessarily raised to the same height at each stroke, there was\r\nabsolutely no means of controlling the force of the blow. When we\r\nreflect on the fact that the rectilinear motion of the piston in the\r\ncylinder of the engine had first to be converted into a rotary one, by\r\nbeams, connecting-rod, crank, &c., and then this rotary movement\r\ntransformed into a lifting one by the intervention of wheels, shafts,\r\ncams, &c., while all that is required in the hammer is a straight\r\nup-and-down movement, the wonder is that such an indirect and cumbersome\r\napplication of power should have for so many years been contentedly\r\nused. But in November, 1839, Mr. Nasmyth, an eminent engineer of\r\nManchester, received a letter from a correspondent, informing him of the\r\ndifficulty he had found in carrying out an order received for the\r\nforging of a shaft for the paddle-wheels of a steamer, which shaft was\r\nrequired to be 3 ft. in diameter. There was in all England no forge\r\nhammer capable of executing such a piece of work. This caused Mr.\r\nNasmyth to reflect on the construction of forge hammers, and in _a few\r\nminutes_ he had formed the conception of the steam hammer. He\r\nimmediately sketched the design, and soon afterward the steam hammer was\r\na _fait accompli_, for Mr. Nasmyth had one at once executed and erected\r\nat his works, where he invited all concerned to come and witness its\r\nperformances. Will it be believed that four years elapsed before this\r\nadmirable application of steam power found employment outside the walls\r\nof Mr. Nasmyth’s workshops? After a time he succeeded in making those\r\nbest able to profit by such an invention aware of the new power—for such\r\nit has practically proved itself, having done more to revolutionize the\r\nmanufacture of iron than any other inventions that can be named, except,\r\nperhaps, those of Cort and Bessemer. The usual prejudice attending the\r\nintroduction of any new machine, however obvious its advantages are\r\nafterward admitted to be, at length cleared away, and the steam hammer\r\nis from henceforth an absolute necessity in every engineering workshop,\r\nand scarcely less so for some of the early stages of the process of\r\nmanufacturing crude wrought iron. Whether blows of enormous energy or\r\ngentle taps are required, or strokes of every gradation and in any\r\norder, the steam hammer is ready to supply them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 13.—_Nasmyth’s Steam Hammer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA steam hammer of the smaller kind is represented in Fig. 13. The\r\ngeneral mode of action will easily be understood. The steam is admitted\r\nbelow the piston, which is thus raised to any required height within the\r\nlimits of the stroke. When the communication with the boiler is shut off\r\nand the steam below the piston is allowed to escape, the piston, with\r\nthe mass of iron forming the hammer attached to the piston-rod, falls by\r\nits own weight. This weight, in the large steam hammers, amounts to\r\nseveral tons; and the force of the blow will depend jointly upon the\r\nweight of the hammer, and upon the height from which it is allowed to\r\nfall. The steam is admitted and allowed to escape by valves, moved by a\r\nlever under the control of a workman. By allowing the hammer to be\r\nraised to a greater or less height, and by regulating the escape of the\r\nsteam from beneath the piston, the operator has it in his power to vary\r\nthe force of the blow. Men who are accustomed to work the valves can do\r\nthis with great nicety. They sometimes exhibit their perfect control\r\nover the machine by cracking a nut on the anvil of a huge hammer; or a\r\nwatch having been placed—face upwards—upon the anvil, and a moistened\r\nwafer laid on the glass, a practised operator will bring down the\r\nponderous mass with such exactitude and delicacy that it will pick up\r\nthe wafer, and the watch-glass will not even be cracked. The steam\r\nhammer has recently been improved in several ways, and its power has\r\nbeen more than doubled, by causing the steam, during the descent, to\r\nenter above the piston and add its pressure to the force of gravity.\r\nProbably one of the most powerful steam hammers ever constructed is that\r\nrecently erected at the Royal Gun Factory at Woolwich, for the purpose\r\nof forging great guns for the British Navy. It has been made by Nasmyth\r\n& Co., and is in shape similar to their other steam hammers. Its height\r\nis upwards of 50 ft., and it is surrounded with furnaces and powerful\r\ncranes, carrying the huge iron tongs that are to grasp the glowing\r\nmasses. The hammer descends not merely with its own weight of 30 tons;\r\nsteam is injected behind the falling piston, which is thus driven down\r\nwith vastly enhanced rapidity and impulse. Of the lower portion of this\r\nstupendous forge, nothing is visible but a flat table of iron—the\r\nanvil—level with the floor of the foundry. But more wonderful, perhaps,\r\nthan anything seen aboveground, is the extraordinarily solid foundation\r\nbeneath. Huge tablets of foot-thick castings alternate with concrete and\r\nenormous baulks of timber, and, lower down, beds of concrete, and piles\r\ndriven deep into the solid earth, form a support for the uppermost\r\nplate, upon which the giant delivers his terrible stroke. Less than this\r\nwould render it unsafe to work the hammer to its full power. As the\r\nmonster works—soberly and obediently though he does it—the solid soil\r\ntrembles, and everything movable shivers, far and near, as, with a\r\nscream of the steam, our ‘hammer of Thor’ came thundering down, mashing\r\nthe hot iron into shape as easily as if it were crimson dough, squirting\r\njets of scarlet and yellow yeast. The head of the hammer, which of\r\ncourse works vertically, is detachable, so that if the monster breaks\r\nhis steel fist upon coil or anvil, another can be quickly supplied.\r\nThese huge heads alone are as big as a sugar-hogshead, and come down\r\nupon the hot iron with an energy of more than a thousand foot-tons. By\r\nthe courteous permission of Major E. Maitland, Superintendent of the\r\nRoyal Gun Factories, we are enabled to present our readers with the view\r\nof the monster hammer which forms the Plate III.\r\n\r\nMr. Condie, in his form of steam hammer, utilizes the mass of the\r\ncylinder itself to serve as the hammer. The piston-rod is hollow, and\r\nforms a pipe, through which the steam is admitted and discharged, and\r\nthe piston is stationary, the cylinder moving instead—between vertical\r\nguides. A hammer face is attached to the bottom of the cylinder by a\r\nkind of dovetail socket, so that if the striking surface becomes injured\r\nin any way, another can easily be substituted. The massive framework\r\nwhich supports the moving parts of Condie’s hammer has its supports\r\nplaced very far apart, so as to leave ample space for the handling of\r\nlarge forgings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14.—_Merryweather’s Steam Fire-Engine._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE III.\r\n\r\n  THE GREAT STEAM HAMMER, ROYAL GUN FACTORY, WOOLWICH.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 15.—_A Foundry._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Iron and coal,” it has been well said, “are kings of the earth”; and\r\nthis is true to such an extent that there is scarcely an invention\r\nclaiming the reader’s attention in this book but what involves the\r\nindispensable use of these materials. Again, in their production on the\r\nlarge scale it will be seen that there is a mutual dependence, and that\r\nthis is made possible only by means of the invention we have begun with;\r\nfor without the steam engine the deep coal mines could not have the\r\nwater pumped out of them,—it was indeed for this very purpose that the\r\nsteam engine was originally contrived,—nor could the coal be efficiently\r\nraised without steam power. Before the steam engine came into use iron\r\ncould not be produced or worked to anything like the extent attained\r\neven in the middle of the nineteenth century, for only by steam power\r\ncould the blast be made effective and the rolling mill do its work. On\r\nthe other hand, the steam engine required iron for its own construction,\r\nand this at once caused a notable increase in the demand for the metal.\r\nOnce more, the engine itself supplies no force; for without the fuel\r\nwhich raises steam from the water in the boiler it is motionless and\r\npowerless, and that fuel is practically _coal_. In consequence of thus\r\nproviding power, and also of supplying a requisite for the production of\r\niron, coal has acquired supreme industrial importance, so that all our\r\ngreat trades and places of densest population are situated in or near\r\ncoal-fields. But what we have further to say about coal may be\r\nconveniently deferred to a subsequent article, while we proceed to treat\r\nof iron, and of the contrivances in which it plays an essential part.\r\n\r\nIron has also been called “the mainspring of civilization,” and the\r\nsignificance of the phrase is obvious enough when we consider the\r\nenormous number and infinite variety of the things that are made of it:\r\nthe sword and the ploughshare; all our weapons of war and all our\r\nimplements of peace; the slender needle and the girders that span wide\r\nrivers; the delicate hair-spring of the tiny watch and the most\r\ntenacious of cables; the common utensils of domestic life and the huge\r\nbattle-ships of our fleets; the smoothest roads, the loftiest towers,\r\nthe most spacious pleasure palaces. Such extensive applications of iron\r\nfor purposes so diverse have been rendered possible only by the greater\r\nfacility and cheapness of production, together with the better knowledge\r\nof the properties of the substance and increased skill in its treatment,\r\nthat have particularly distinguished our century. Apart again from the\r\nconstructive uses of iron, it enters essentially into another class of\r\ninventions of which the age is justly proud, namely, those which utilize\r\nelectricity in the production of light, mechanical power, and chemical\r\naction; for it is on a quality possessed by iron, and by _iron alone_,\r\nthat the generation of current by the electric dynamo ultimately\r\ndepends. This peculiar property of iron, which was first announced by\r\nArago in 1820, and has since proved so fertile in practical\r\napplications, is that a bar of the metal can, under suitable conditions,\r\nbe instantly converted into the most powerful of magnets, and as quickly\r\ndemagnetized. What these conditions are will be explained when we come\r\nto treat of electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.—_Aerolite in the British Museum._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBesides the unique property of iron just referred to, and its\r\nsuperlative utility in arts and industries, there are other\r\ncircumstances that give a peculiar interest to this metal. It is the\r\nchief constituent of many minerals, and traces or small quantities are\r\nfound in most of the materials that make up the crust of the earth; it\r\nis present also in the organic kingdoms, being especially notable in the\r\nblood of vertebrate (_back-boned_) animals, of which it is an essential\r\ncomponent. Notwithstanding its wide diffusion, iron is not found\r\n_native_, that is, as _metal_, but has to be extracted from its _ores_,\r\nwhich are usually dull stony-looking substances, as unlike the metal as\r\ncan be conceived. In this respect it differs from gold, which is not met\r\nin any other than the metallic state, in the form of _nuggets_, minute\r\ncrystals or branching filaments, and from metals such as silver, copper,\r\nand a few others which also are occasionally found native. It is true\r\nthat rarely small quantities of metallic iron have been met with in the\r\nform of minute grains disseminated in volcanic rocks; but in contrast\r\nwith the practical absence of metallic iron from terrestrial accessible\r\nmaterials is the fact that masses of iron, sometimes of nearly pure\r\nmetal, occasionally descend upon the earth from interplanetary space.\r\nThese are _aerolites_, of which there are several varieties, some\r\nconsisting only of crystalline minerals without any metallic iron,\r\nothers of a mixture of minerals and metals, but the most common are of\r\niron, always alloyed with a small quantity of nickel, and usually\r\ncontaining also traces more or less of a few other metals and known\r\nchemical elements. The iron in some specimens has been found to amount\r\nto 93 per cent. of the whole. These _aerolites_, or _meteorites_, as\r\nthey are also called, are of irregular shape and vary greatly in size,\r\nwhich however is sometimes very considerable: one found in South America\r\nwas calculated to weigh 14 tons, another discovered in Mexico, 20 tons.\r\nThere is in the British Museum a good specimen of an iron meteorite,\r\nwhich is represented in Fig. 16, where it will be observed that a\r\nportion has been cut off to form a plane surface, which when polished\r\nand etched by an acid, reveals a crystalline structure quite peculiar\r\nand distinctive, so that such meteorites can be recognized with\r\ncertainty, even if they did not possess surface characters which are\r\neasily observed and identified when once a specimen has been examined.\r\nThe fall of meteorites to the surface of the earth is comparatively\r\nrare, but it has been witnessed by even scientific observers; as when\r\nGassendi, the French astronomer, saw in Provence the fall of a meteorite\r\nweighing 59 lbs. In the _Transactions of the Royal Society_ for 1802 may\r\nbe found a detailed account of an instance in England of the fall which\r\ntook place in Yorkshire, on the 13th December 1795, of a stone 56 lbs.\r\nin weight. Aerolites become ignited or incandescent by reason of the\r\ngreat velocity with which they pass through the atmosphere, whereby the\r\nair in front of them is condensed and heated, the heat often being\r\nsufficient to liquefy or even vaporize the solid matter. The so-called\r\nshooting stars are with good reason believed to be nothing but such\r\nincandescent aerolites, and the aerolites themselves are regarded as\r\nsmall asteroids, or scattered planetary dust, portions of which\r\noccasionally coming within the sphere of the earth’s attraction are\r\ndrawn to its surface. Meteoric iron is too rare to be of any value as a\r\nsource of iron, but certain specimens have been found in which the metal\r\nwas malleable and of excellent quality. From such meteorites the natives\r\nof India and other places have, it is said, sometimes forged weapons of\r\nwonderful temper and keenness, and we may well imagine that when such\r\nweapons have been made from iron that had actually been observed to fall\r\nfrom the sky, they would be regarded as endowed with magical powers, so\r\nthat we may perhaps ascribe to such circumstances the origin of some of\r\nthe legends about enchanted swords, etc. It is significant also that in\r\nsome Egyptian inscriptions of the very highest antiquity, the word\r\nindicating iron has for its literal meaning _stone of the sky_.\r\n\r\nBut as nature has hardly provided man with the _metal_ iron, he has been\r\nobliged to find the art of extracting it from substances which are\r\nutterly unlike the metal itself. In this case, as in many others, the\r\nart has been discovered and practised ages before any scientific\r\nknowledge of the nature of the processes employed had been acquired. The\r\nidea prevails that there are such difficulties in extracting this metal;\r\nthat elaborate and complex appliances, not unlike those in use in modern\r\ntimes, were requisite for the purpose; and therefore that the use of\r\niron is compatible only with a somewhat late period in man’s history,\r\nand implies a comparatively advanced stage of civilization. Now there\r\nundoubtedly are facts which tend to confirm this view; for instance, the\r\nSpaniards who first colonized North America found the natives perfectly\r\nfamiliar with the use of copper, but without any acquaintance with iron,\r\nalthough the region abounded with the finest ferruginous minerals; and,\r\nagain, the archæologists who have examined the relics of ancient\r\ncivilizations and of pre-historic peoples about the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, find in the earliest of these relics weapons and\r\nimplements of rudely chipped stones, followed later by the use of\r\nbetter-shaped and polished stones; hence the periods represented by\r\nthese, they have respectively designated by the terms _palæolithic_ and\r\n_neolithic_—the old and the new stone ages. At some later time the stone\r\nof these implements was gradually replaced by _bronze_, which is a\r\nmixture of copper and tin, while as yet iron does not occur in any form\r\namong the remains. In the latest layers, however, articles of iron are\r\nfound, and it is inferred that this metal came into use only after\r\nbronze had been known for an indefinite period; hence these later\r\npre-historic periods have come to be respectively called _the bronze\r\nage_ and _the iron age_. No doubt this succession really occurred in the\r\nlocalities where the observations were made, but it would not be\r\njustifiable to assume that the same was the case in every part of the\r\nworld, for much would depend on such circumstances as the presence or\r\nabsence of the essential minerals. We may also set against the supposed\r\ndifficulty of obtaining iron from the ores, the still greater complexity\r\nof the methods required for the production of copper and of tin. Besides\r\nthis is the fact that the ores of tin are found but in very few places\r\nin the world, and of these only the Cornwall mines, so well known in\r\nancient times, would be likely to furnish a supply to the places where\r\npre-historic bronzes are found; this implies that navigation and\r\ncommerce must have already made considerable progress. On the other\r\nhand, iron has been produced and worked for untold ages by the negro\r\nraces all over Central Africa, and the method of treating the ore has no\r\ndoubt been that which is there still practised by certain scarcely\r\ncivilized tribes, and it is as simple as any metallurgical operation can\r\npossibly be, requiring merely a hole dug in a clay bank, wherein the\r\nfuel and minerals are piled up, and the mere wind supplies sufficient\r\nblast to urge the fire to the needful temperature, or air is blown in\r\nfrom rude bellows made of a pair of skins alternately raised and\r\ncompressed. These very primitive furnaces have in some places developed\r\ninto permanent clay structures, seven or eight feet in height. The\r\nnatives of Central Africa have therefore long known the method of\r\nextracting iron, as well as of forging and casting it.\r\n\r\nThe nature and value of what has been done during the century in the\r\ntreatment of iron would not be intelligible without some description of\r\nthe ordinary processes of extracting the metal from the ores; and a\r\nscientific understanding of these implies some acquaintance with\r\nchemistry. Not because metallurgy has been developed from chemistry, for\r\nthe fact is rather the reverse; indeed, as we have seen, the art of\r\nextracting iron from its ores was practised ages before chemistry as a\r\nscience was dreamt of. Although we may assume that many of our readers\r\nhave sufficient knowledge of chemistry to attach distinct ideas to such\r\nfew chemical terms as we shall have occasion to use, yet it may be of\r\nadvantage to others to have some preliminary notes of the character of\r\nthe chemical actions, and of some properties of the substances that will\r\nhave to be referred to. It is certainly the case that people in general,\r\nand even people very well informed in other subjects, have but the\r\nvaguest notions of the nature of chemical actions, and of the meaning of\r\nthe terms belonging to that science. For example, one of our most\r\npopular and justly esteemed writers, treating of the very subject of\r\niron extraction, calls the ore a _matrix_, thereby implying that the\r\niron as metal is disseminated in detached fragments throughout the mass,\r\nwhich is a conception inconsistent with the facts. The reader will be in\r\na more advantageous position for understanding the relation of the ores\r\nof iron to the metal, if he will follow in imagination, or still better\r\nin reality, a few observations and experiments like the following—of\r\nwhich, however, he is recommended not to attempt the chemical part\r\nunless he is himself practically familiar with the performance of\r\nchemical operations, or can obtain the personal assistance of someone\r\nwho is. Taking, say, a few common iron nails, let him note some obvious\r\nproperties they possess: they have weight—are hard and tough so that\r\nthey cannot be crushed in a mortar—are opaque to light—if a smooth\r\nsurface be produced on any part, it will show that peculiar shiny\r\nappearance which is called metallic lustre, in this case without any\r\ndecided colour—they are not dissolved by water as sugar or salt is—and\r\nare attracted by a magnet. If several of the nails be heated to bright\r\nredness they may be hammered on an anvil into one mass, and this may be\r\nflattened out into a thin plate, or it may be shaped into a slender rod\r\nand then drawn out into wire; or otherwise the nails may be converted\r\ninto the small fragments called iron filings. In these several forms the\r\nnails, as nails, will have ceased to exist; but the material of which\r\nthey were formed will remain unchanged, and each and every part of it\r\nhowever large or small will continue to exhibit all the properties noted\r\nabove as belonging to the substance of the nails, which in the cases\r\nsupposed has undergone merely _physical_ change of shape. Treating our\r\nnails in yet another way, we may proceed to subject them to a _chemical_\r\nchange, by an experiment very simple in itself, but involving certain\r\nprecautions, by neglect of which the tyro in chemical operations would\r\nincur some personal risks; these might however be obviated by using only\r\nvery small quantities of the materials (a mere pinch of iron filings and\r\na few drops of sulphuric acid), when the results would still be\r\nsufficiently observable. A few of the iron nails having been placed in a\r\nflask of thin glass, we pour upon them a mixture of oil of vitriol\r\n(sulphuric acid) and water, which has previously been prepared by\r\ngradually adding 1 measure of the acid to 5 measures of water. The\r\naction that takes place is greatly accelerated by heat, and indeed the\r\ncontents should be heated to boiling by standing the flask on a layer of\r\nfine sand spread on an iron plate and gently heated from below. The\r\nnails will soon disappear, being completely dissolved by the acid\r\nliquid, and the turbid solution should be filtered through filtering\r\npaper as rapidly as possible and while still hot. This turbid and dirty\r\nlooking condition is due to foreign matters in the nails, for these\r\nnever consist of _pure_ iron. The filtered liquid is set aside to cool\r\nin a closed vessel, in which after a time will be found a deposit of\r\ncrystals of a pale bluish-green colour. The liquor above these having\r\nbeen poured off, the crystals are to be rinsed with a very small\r\nquantity of _cold_ water, and then dried between folds of\r\nblotting-paper, after which they are ready for examination. The quantity\r\nof the diluted acid put into the flask should have a certain proportion\r\nto the weight of the nails; about 5 _fluid ounces_ to 1 ounce of iron\r\nwill be found convenient, for if less is used the nails will not be\r\nentirely dissolved, and an excess will tend to keep the crystals in\r\nsolution instead of depositing them when cold. The nails—as such—will\r\nnow have passed out of existence: can we say that the iron that formed\r\nthem exists in the crystals? Certainly not as the _metal_ iron, for\r\nevery property of the metal will have disappeared. The crystals are\r\nbrittle, can be crushed in a mortar—they are translucent—they show no\r\nmetallic lustre, but only glassy surfaces—they are readily dissolved by\r\nwater—they are not attracted by a magnet. The most powerful lens will\r\nfail to show the least particle of iron in them; they have in their\r\nproperties no assignable relation to the metal of the nails, but are\r\nmatter of quite another sort; and be it noted that this entire\r\n_otherness_ is the special and characteristic sign of _chemical change_.\r\nSo complete is the transformation in the case we have been considering\r\nthat it would never have been said that iron was contained in these\r\ncrystals, but rather that the metal had for ever passed out of\r\nexistence, but for one circumstance; and that is, that by subjecting the\r\ncrystals to certain processes of _chemical analysis_ we can again obtain\r\nfrom them the iron in metallic state. Nay more, we should find the\r\nweight of metal so obtained to be exactly equal to that of the pure iron\r\ndissolved from the original nails, supposing of course that we operated\r\nupon the whole of the crystalline matter so produced. The inference\r\ntherefore is that although every property of the iron appeared to be\r\nabsent from the crystals, the iron entering in them retained there its\r\noriginal weight, and the correct statement of the change would be, that\r\nin the crystals the iron had lost all its original properties SAVE ONE,\r\nnamely, its weight, or gravitating force, if we choose to call it so, a\r\nproperty belonging to it in common with every material substance.\r\nChemical analysis can also separate from the crystals their other\r\nconstituents and weigh them apart—so much water and so much sulphuric\r\nacid—and when to these weights that of the iron is added, the sum\r\nexactly makes up the weight of the crystals.\r\n\r\nA still simpler experiment, which may be performed by anyone with the\r\ngreatest ease, may serve as a further illustration of the profound\r\nnature of the change in the properties of bodies brought about by\r\nchemical combination, and it will also serve as the occasion of\r\ndirecting attention to a remarkable circumstance that invariably\r\ncharacterizes such changes, and one that should always be present in our\r\nminds when we are considering them. A yard of flat _magnesium_ wire can\r\nbe bought for a few pence, and after its metallic character has been\r\nobserved in the silvery lustre disclosed by scraping the dull white\r\nsurface, a few inches is to be held vertically by a pair of tongs, or by\r\ninserting one extremity in a cleft at the end of a stick, then the lower\r\npart is brought into contact with a candle or gas flame. The metal will\r\ninstantly burn with a dazzlingly brilliant light, and some white smoke\r\n(really fine white solid particles) will float into the air; but if a\r\nplate be held under the burning metal, some of the smoke will settle\r\nupon it, together with white fragments that have preserved some shape of\r\nthe metallic ribbon, but which a touch will reduce into a fine white\r\npowder, identical with the well-known domestic medicine called “calcined\r\nmagnesia”—a substance totally different from the _metal magnesium_. The\r\nreader will scarcely require to be told that in this burning the metal\r\nis entering into combination with the oxygen of the air—by which that\r\ninvisible gas somehow becomes fixed in these solid white particles, so\r\nentirely unlike itself. But this experiment might be so arranged that\r\nthe quantities of magnesium and oxygen entering into the magnesia could\r\nbe weighed. For this purpose special appliances would be required in\r\norder to ensure complete combustion of the metal, for in the experiment\r\nas just described some small particles are liable to be shielded from\r\nthe oxygen by a covering of magnesia, and the arrangement would have to\r\nbe such that the _whole_ of the white powder could be gathered up and\r\nweighed. In the absence of such appliances, and of a delicate balance,\r\ntogether with the skill requisite for their use, the reader must for the\r\ntime be contented to take our word for what would be the result. In\r\nevery experiment the magnesia would be found heavier than the metal\r\nburned in the proportion of 5 to 3; in other words, magnesia always\r\ncontains (so the phrase runs) 3 parts of magnesium combined with 2 of\r\noxygen: never more nor less. A definite proportion between the weights\r\nof the constituent substances characterizes every chemical combination,\r\nand when this is once determined in a single sample of the compound, it\r\nis determined for every portion of the same, wherever found or however\r\nproduced. But each compound has its own particular proportion, that is,\r\nthe quantitative relations are different for each. For example, the two\r\nconstituents of water, hydrogen and oxygen, are combined in the ratio of\r\n1 to 8, etc.; and oxygen combines with metals in a ratio different in\r\neach case. Then occasionally the same ratio of constituents occurs in\r\ncompounds of different composition. The elementary student is apt to\r\nsuppose that this is _because_ of the _law_ which he finds stated,\r\nprobably in almost the first page of his text-book: “Every compound\r\ncontains its elements in definite and invariable proportions”; and even\r\nwell-educated people entertain the idea of the fact being “governed by”\r\nor “obeying” the law just quoted,—a misconception arising from the other\r\nuse of the word “law,” as signifying an enactment. The real case however\r\nis the converse; namely, that a multitude of facts like that above\r\nstated have governed the law, and caused it to be what it is—the general\r\nstatement of many observed facts.\r\n\r\nWe have assumed that the reader’s chemical knowledge had already made\r\nhim aware that in every case of ordinary combustion the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere is in the act of entering into combination with the burning\r\nbody: as with the magnesium, so with a coal fire, a gas flame, or a\r\nburning candle; only in these last cases the products of the combustion\r\npass away invisibly. The candle by burning disappears from sight, but\r\nits matter is not lost, and as in the case of magnesium, the compounds\r\nit forms weigh more than the unburnt candle. The experiment is commonly\r\nshown in courses of elementary lectures on chemistry, of so burning a\r\ncandle that the invisible products are retained in the apparatus,\r\ninstead of being dissipated in the atmosphere, and the increase of\r\nweight of the burnt candle over the original one is demonstrated by the\r\nbalance. Important as is the part played by oxygen in all chemical\r\nactions on the earth, the composition of the atmosphere was not\r\nunderstood until the end of the eighteenth century, and it was well on\r\ninto the nineteenth before the quantities of its constituents were\r\naccurately determined. Now everyone knows that air is mainly made up of\r\na _mixture_ of the two gases _oxygen_ and _nitrogen_. A _mixture_ of two\r\nor more things is very different from a chemical _combination_ of them;\r\nfor in the former each ingredient retains its own properties. (See _Air_\r\nin Index.) Nitrogen being an inert gas that takes no part in combustion,\r\nor in the ordinary chemical actions of the air, acts therein simply as a\r\ndiluent of the oxygen. It is necessary in relation to our present\r\nsubject to bear this in mind, as well as the relative quantities of the\r\ntwo gases in air. For our immediate purpose we may neglect the minor\r\nconstituents of air—such as watery vapour, carbonic acid, etc., of which\r\nthe total weight does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole—and\r\nconsider air as a mixture of 23 parts by weight of oxygen with 77 of\r\nnitrogen, or calculated in volumes, 21 measures of oxygen with 79 of\r\nnitrogen. Compounds of oxygen with nearly every one of the other seventy\r\nor more chemical elements are known, and these compounds, which are\r\ncalled _oxides_, are arranged by chemists under five or six classes,\r\nforming as they do _basic radicles_, _acid radicles_, _saline oxides_,\r\netc. With some of these compounds belonging to different classes, we\r\nmust make acquaintance after noticing the elementary substance with\r\nwhich the oxygen is united.\r\n\r\nWe begin with _carbon_, which forms the chief constituent of all our\r\ncombustibles. Some specimens of graphite, plumbago, or “blacklead”\r\nconsist of almost pure carbon (98 per cent.), and some varieties of wood\r\ncharcoal exceptionally contain 96 per cent.; but in ordinary charcoal\r\nthe percentage is much less. Coal, the most familiar of our solid fuels,\r\nvaries greatly in composition, carbon being the predominating\r\nconstituent, in amount from 57 to 93 per cent. Coke, another fuel much\r\nused in metallurgical operations, is made by heating coal without access\r\nof air, when a large quantity of gaseous substances is expelled. Coke\r\nburns with an intense and steady heat without emitting any visible\r\nsmoke, but it does not ignite as readily as coal. Carbon forms two\r\ndifferent compounds with oxygen: both are invisible gases, but they\r\ndiffer in the proportions of the constituents, and present different\r\nproperties. When carbon (coal, coke, or charcoal) is completely burnt,\r\nthat is, with an abundant supply of air, the product is _carbonic acid_\r\ngas, in which 3 parts of carbon are combined with 8 of oxygen: when, on\r\nthe other hand, the carbon is burnt with a sufficiently restricted\r\naccess of air, the result is _carbonic oxide_ gas, in which 3 parts of\r\ncarbon are united with only 4 of oxygen. The reader will here observe\r\nthat the former contains just twice as much oxygen as the latter for the\r\nsame quantity of carbon. This fact and numberless others like it are\r\nexpressed or summed up by another _law_ of chemical combination which\r\nstates that when two elements combine in several different proportions\r\nthese are invariably such that the ratios in the several compounds will\r\nbe found to have exact and simple numerical relations; that is, such as\r\nmay, when reduced to their lowest terms, be expressed by the simple\r\nintegers 1, 2, 3, etc., as 1 : 2, 3 : 2; ... 8 : 9, etc. It comes to the\r\nsame thing if we compare together the weights A and A´ which are united\r\nin each compound with any one identical weight of B, giving of course\r\nthe ratio A : B ÷ A´ : B. For instance, in the case just given, of\r\ncarbon and oxygen, 3 : 4 ÷ 3 : 8 = 2 : 1. This, which is simply stating\r\nthe facts, is called the _law of multiple proportions_. On a later page\r\nwill be found another illustration (see Index, _Nitrogen and Oxygen\r\nCompounds_), and its expression in terms of the _atomic theory_, which\r\ngoes behind the facts (so to speak), but is extremely useful by\r\ncomprehending many other groups of facts in chemistry and in other\r\nsciences. Carbonic acid gas is of course incombustible, but carbonic\r\noxide gas burns by uniting with the additional proportion of oxygen and\r\nbecoming carbonic acid. On the other hand, carbonic acid gas passing\r\nover red-hot coals takes up from them the additional proportion of\r\ncarbon, and is, we may say, _unburnt_ into carbonic oxide. When we see a\r\npale blue flame flickering over the bright embers in a fire grate, it is\r\ncarbonic oxide burning back again by taking more oxygen from the air\r\nabove the coals. Carbonic oxide combines directly with two or three of\r\nthe metals, as, for instance, it forms a volatile compound with nickel,\r\nat a certain temperature, and this is decomposed again at a higher\r\ntemperature. The like takes place with iron, although in very small\r\nquantities, but the observation throws some light on the processes of\r\nreduction. Carbonic oxide is neither acid nor basic, but carbonic acid\r\nis an acid oxide, and as such unites with oxides of the basic class to\r\nform another range of compounds. Thus, for example, the oxide of the\r\nmetal _calcium_ is quicklime, which is strongly basic, and this directly\r\ncombines with carbonic acid, forming a _neutral_ substance called in\r\nsystematic chemistry _calcium carbonate_, or more commonly but less\r\ncorrectly, carbonate of lime, familiar to everyone in the compact state\r\nas limestone, and marble, and in a more or less pulverent condition as\r\nchalk. When any of these is heated to redness, carbonic acid is expelled\r\nand quicklime remains. Like most oxides, quicklime forms a compound with\r\nwater, the combination being attended with the extrication of much heat,\r\nthe compact quicklime swelling and crumbling into _slaked lime_. The\r\nchemist’s term for a compound of a _basic_ oxide with water is\r\n_hydrate_, while that of an _acid_ oxide with water is for him properly\r\nan _acid_, or in order to particularly distinguish this class, an\r\n_oxy-acid_. It was however the older practice to give the name of acid\r\nto the oxide alone, and this naming having found its way into popular\r\nlanguage is much more familiar to the non-scientific reader. The\r\nsystematic names of the two compounds of carbon and oxygen are _carbon\r\nmonoxide_ and _carbon dioxide_, but we shall use here the more familiar\r\nterms carbonic oxide and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nWe have now to call attention to a substance which contributes by far\r\nthe largest part to the solid crust of our globe. It is called _silica_,\r\nfrom _silic-_, the Latin word for flint (without case suffix): it is\r\nseen in flint, and very pure in rock crystal, quartz, agate, and\r\ncalcedony. It forms the essential part of every kind of sand and\r\nsandstone, and is the principal ingredient of clay, granite, slate,\r\nbasalt, and many other minerals. Silica is the oxide of a quasi-metal\r\ncalled _silicon_, which can be obtained from silica with difficulty, and\r\nonly by roundabout processes, presenting itself in different conditions\r\naccording to the process used. Silica is an acid oxide, and it readily\r\nunites with most of the basic oxides when heated with them, forming a\r\nclass of compounds of different properties which are much modified in\r\nadmixtures containing two or more. Very few of these _silicates_ are\r\nsoluble in water, most of them are not: they are all fusible at various\r\ntemperatures, except silicate of alumina, of which fire-clay is chiefly\r\nconstituted. Alumina, it should be stated, is the oxide of the metal\r\naluminium. The silicates of lime and of magnesia fuse only with great\r\ndifficulty; but the silicates of iron and of manganese are easily fused,\r\nand silicate of lead still more so. Glass is a mixture of silicates,\r\noften of lime, soda, and alumina; sometimes of lead and potash mainly;\r\nporcelain and pottery consist chiefly of silicate of alumina with\r\nvarying proportions of silicates of iron, of lime, etc.\r\n\r\nIt now remains only to mention two non-metallic elements that are nearly\r\nalways present in crude iron, but which the metallurgist strives to\r\neliminate, as they are in general very injurious to the quality of the\r\nmaterial even when their amount is very small. The first is _sulphur_,\r\nwell known as _brimstone_, also as _flowers of sulphur_, a yellow\r\ncoloured solid, which burns in the air. The product of the combustion is\r\nan invisible gas of a readily recognized pungent odour: this is an\r\nacid-forming oxide containing equal weights of sulphur and oxygen. There\r\nis another oxide in which the weight of oxygen is one and a half times\r\nthat of the sulphur, and this is the radicle of the very active\r\n_sulphuric acid_ or _oil of vitriol_. Sulphur, like oxygen, unites with\r\nmost of the other elements, forming compounds called _sulphides_. Of\r\nthese the iron compound called _pyrites_ is the best known, and its\r\noccurrence in coal prevents the use of that material as fuel in contact\r\nwith iron or other metals. _Phosphorus_ is an element that occurs\r\nnaturally only in combination; in its separated state it is a very\r\ninflammable solid. It combines directly with other substances and is\r\ntaken up by some fused metals in large quantities. In many cases a very\r\nsmall proportion of it existing in a metal greatly modifies the\r\nproperties of that metal. Phosphorus forms several oxides, and these are\r\nradicles of powerful acids, among which is _phosphoric acid_ that\r\ncombines with basic oxides to form _phosphates_.\r\n\r\nWe have now, in the few last paragraphs, set before the reader the\r\nminimum of chemical knowledge that will enable him to follow the\r\n_rationale_ of such processes of the modern treatment of iron and its\r\nores as we can here give an outline of. Although there are numberless\r\nminerals from which some iron can be extracted, the name of _iron ore_\r\nis confined to such as contain a sufficient amount to make the\r\nextraction commercially profitable, and this requires that the mineral\r\nshould be capable of yielding at least one-fifth of its weight. The ores\r\nare very abundant in many parts of the world, and they consist mainly of\r\n_oxides_ and their _hydrates_, or of _carbonate_, or of carbonate mixed\r\nwith clay and silicates, sometimes also with coaly matters in addition.\r\nThe carbonate iron ores are often mixed with oxides. Each class of ore\r\nis liable to be contaminated with phosphates and with sulphur. The\r\nrichest ore is the _magnetic iron ore_, which is found in enormous\r\nmasses in Sweden, Russia, and North America. It is an oxide containing\r\n72·41 per cent. of iron. _Red hæmatite_ and _specular ore_ are varieties\r\nof another oxide with 70 per cent. of iron: the former is a very pure\r\nore when compact. It is found in Lancashire, Cumberland, and South\r\nWales, and much has been imported from Spain, while America has abundant\r\nsupplies near Lake Superior. Specular iron ore forms brilliant\r\nsteel-like crystals which show the red colour of hæmatite only when\r\nscratched or powdered. Elba was famous for this ore, which occurs also\r\nin Russia and Sweden, and large deposits are met with in both North and\r\nSouth America. Brown hæmatite is a hydrate of the former, containing 60\r\nper cent. of iron; it abounds in France and Spain, where some kinds are\r\nassociated with a noteworthy quantity of _phosphate_ of iron. _Spathic_\r\nor _sparry iron_ ore is, when pure, a collection of nearly colourless\r\ntransparent crystals, consisting of carbonate of iron; it contains about\r\n48 per cent. of iron, and also some of the metal _manganese_, which last\r\ncircumstance makes it, as we shall see, particularly suitable for\r\nproducing certain kinds of steel—indeed it is sometimes called _steel\r\nore_. Large beds of it occur in Styria and Carinthia. _Clay iron stone_,\r\nor _clay-band_, has been extensively mined in Britain. It is found\r\nabundantly in Staffordshire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and South Wales. It\r\nconsists of carbonate of iron intimately mixed with clay. The quantity\r\nof iron in some samples falls as low as 17 per cent., but it rises with\r\nvariations to as much as 50 per cent. Much of its importance arises from\r\nthe fact of its occurring in beds alternating with layers of coal,\r\nlimestone, and clay, so that the same pit is sometimes able to supply\r\nfirebricks for building the furnace, fuel for the smelting, and\r\nlimestone for the _flux_,—a combination of advantages that for long\r\nenabled iron to be produced in England cheaper than elsewhere. The like\r\nis true of the _blackband ore_, which, in addition to the same\r\nferruginous composition as the last, contains also so much combustible\r\nor bituminous material that it can be _calcined_ (roasted) without\r\nadditional fuel. The deposits of _blackband_ in Lanarkshire and\r\nAyrshire, which were discovered only in 1801, have given great\r\nindustrial importance to the district. Yet another British ore must be\r\nnoticed, namely, the _Cleveland ironstone_ of the North Riding of\r\nYorkshire. This is a carbonate of a grey or bluish colour caused by the\r\npresence of a little iron silicate. It contains also a considerable\r\namount of phosphorus.\r\n\r\nHow simple is the operation of obtaining iron from the ore has already\r\nbeen stated—that it is necessary only to surround lumps of ore by fuel\r\nin a fire urged by a natural or artificial blast, and then to hammer the\r\nmass extracted from the furnace so as to weld together the scattered\r\nparticles of the metal, and at the same time squeeze out the associated\r\nslag and cinders, in order to obtain a coherent malleable piece, which\r\ncan be reheated in a smith’s fire, and forged into any required form. It\r\nis no wonder therefore that iron was so produced by the ancient Britons;\r\nat any rate Cæsar found them well provided with iron implements and\r\nweapons. No doubt the Romans brought their more advanced skill to the\r\nworking of the metal; but in the matter of treating the original ore,\r\nthe methods they pursued on an extensive scale in Britain were of the\r\nrude kind already described. Indeed in localities where the Romans were\r\nknown to have carried on their operations, the remains of their workings\r\nare almost always found on high ground, so that it may be inferred that\r\nthey relied upon the winds to fan their fires, and their operations were\r\nincomplete and wasteful. The most extensive of them appear to have been\r\nin Sussex and Monmouthshire, in which last county there are places where\r\nthe ground is in large areas covered by their cinders and refuse, and in\r\nthis about 30 or 40 per cent. of iron occurs, so that for some centuries\r\nthis material was found capable of being profitably reworked as a source\r\nof the metal. Iron continued to be produced in England during the middle\r\nages with charcoal for fuel, but its export was forbidden, and whatever\r\nsteel was required had to be imported from abroad. Afterwards German\r\nartisans were brought over for making steel, and soon afterwards the\r\nimportation of shears, knives, locks, and other articles was prohibited.\r\nThe native production of iron continued, and this consumed the forests\r\nso rapidly for the supply of charcoal, that various Acts were passed to\r\nrestrain the iron-makers, in order to preserve the timber. In spite of\r\nthese, the arts of smelting and working iron advanced apace: bellows\r\nwere used for the blast, and then the works were brought down into the\r\nvalleys, where water power could be employed to work them. The scarcity\r\nof charcoal fuel caused many attempts to supply its place with pit coal,\r\nbut these met with small success, partly on account of the coal\r\ncontaining so much sulphur, and partly from the difficulty of obtaining\r\nwith it a sufficiently high temperature, especially as the blowing\r\napparatus was as yet very imperfect. At length, in the first half of the\r\nseventeenth century, the problem was solved by Dud Dudley, whose process\r\nwas kept secret, but is believed to have consisted in supplying coal at\r\nthe top of a higher furnace, in such a manner that the coal was\r\nconverted into _coke_ by the heat of the escaping gases before it\r\nreached the reducing zone of the furnace. This innovation was violently\r\nopposed by the charcoal smelters, who persecuted the inventor in every\r\nway, until their resistance was successful. But before the middle of the\r\nnext century coke was regularly used in iron smelting, the process\r\nhaving been made successful by Darby at Coalbrookdale, and then many new\r\napplications of cast iron came into vogue. Coke being a substance\r\nburning less freely than charcoal, bellows were found inadequate to give\r\nthe necessary blast, and were displaced by _blowing cylinders_, actuated\r\nat first by water wheels, but this uncertain and comparatively feeble\r\nsource of power was soon superseded by the steam engine, the “fire\r\nengine,” for which, as we have seen, Watt obtained his patent in 1769.\r\nThe furnaces were not then all engaged in producing the fusible metal\r\nnow called _cast_ or _pig iron_ as are the huge blast furnaces we see at\r\nthe present time. Indeed it was much to the disgust of the old iron\r\nsmelter that occasionally his product turned out to be of the fusible\r\nkind, unworkable by the hammer, which therefore he regarded as\r\nworthless. At what date _cast iron_ was first used is uncertain; but\r\nprobably it was not long before the fourteenth century. The furnaces in\r\nuse up to that time were small square walled-in structures only 3 or 4\r\nfeet high, and their effect would not greatly exceed that of a smith’s\r\nforge: but as improved blowing apparatus gave more power, they soon\r\nbecame enlarged into oval or round brick towers from 10 to 15 feet high,\r\nand they, like the small furnaces, could be made to yield either smith\r\niron or steel by modifying the charge and the manner of applying the\r\nblast; while furnaces of dimensions exceeding a certain limit could no\r\nlonger be trusted to turn out malleable metal, but they produced instead\r\nthe cruder substance we call white pig iron, and this requires much\r\nsubsequent treatment before it is converted into malleable or “merchant\r\niron.” Nevertheless the demand for cast iron as such, and more\r\nparticularly the adoption of improved methods of deriving malleable iron\r\nfrom it, caused further increase in the size and numbers of blast\r\nfurnaces, until in the early part of our century 30 feet was not an\r\nunusual height, the highest one in England in 1830 attaining 40 feet.\r\nThe total make of pig iron in England was in that year nearly 700,000\r\ntons, perhaps about fifty times as much as it was a century before, and\r\nthirty years later (1860) it had risen to nearly 4,000,000 tons. These\r\nfigures show the extraordinary expansion of the British iron manufacture\r\nin the earlier part of the century; and the still more extensive\r\napplications of iron during the next twenty years had the effect of\r\nalmost doubling the produce in 1880, and of increasing also three-fold\r\nthe amount of foreign metal imported, raising it to 2,500,000 tons. The\r\nreader will now, it is hoped, be prepared to follow with some interest a\r\nbrief account of the principal inventions which have brought about\r\nresults of such importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.—_Blast Furnace (Obsolete Type)._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—_Section and Plan of Blast Furnace (Obsolete Type)._\r\n]\r\n\r\nDeferring for the moment any description of the latest blast furnaces,\r\nwe invite his attention to Fig. 17, which represents the furnace used in\r\nthe first half of our century, but which now is of an obsolete type,\r\nFig. 18 being the section and plan of the same. The lower part of Fig.\r\n17 shows where the molten metal has been allowed to run out of the\r\nfurnace into channels made in dry sand; first a main stream, then\r\nbranches to right and left, each of these with smaller offsets on each\r\nside of it. These smaller channels are the moulds for the _pigs_, so\r\ncalled because of the fancied resemblance of their position with regard\r\nto the branch that supplied them, to the litter of a sow. They are\r\neasily broken off from the larger mass, and then form pieces about 3 ft.\r\nlong with a ᗜ-shaped section, 4 in. wide, the weight being from 60 to 80\r\nlbs. This is iron of the crudest kind, and though it is often referred\r\nto as “cast iron,” it is, as a matter of fact, not used in this state\r\nfor any castings, except those of the very roughest and largest kind: a\r\ncertain amount of purification is requisite in most cases. This is given\r\nby fusing the metal—along with some form of oxide and often other\r\nmatters—in a _cupola furnace_, which is like a small blast furnace,\r\nbeing from 8 ft. to 20 ft. high and uses coke for fuel with a cold\r\nblast.\r\n\r\nSo far from being simply iron, pig contains a large and variable\r\nproportion of other matters amounting often to 10 or 12 per cent.; and\r\nthese confer upon it its fusibility. The principal one is carbon, which\r\nis found in the metal partly in the state of chemical combination with\r\nit, and partly in the form of small crystals similar to those of\r\ngraphite or plumbago, disseminated through the mass. When there is a\r\ncomparatively small proportion of the carbon combined with the iron, the\r\nsubstance is grey, and it can be filed or drilled or turned in a lathe.\r\nIn white cast iron the combined carbon predominates, or is sometimes\r\naccompanied by scarcely any graphitic carbon; it is brittle and so very\r\nhard that a file makes no impression. It fuses at a lower temperature\r\nthan the other varieties. A third kind is the _mottled_ cast iron, which\r\nshows a large coarse grain when broken, and distinct points of separate\r\ngraphite particles; it is tougher than the others, and therefore when\r\ncannon were made of cast iron this variety was preferred. The following\r\ntable giving the percentage composition of four samples of crude cast\r\niron will show their diversities.\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────────────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐\r\n │                                 │  White.│  White.│Mottled.│   Grey.│\r\n ├─────────────────────────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤\r\n │Iron                             │   88·81│  89·304│   93·29│  90·376│\r\n │Combined carbon                  │    4·94│   2·457│    2·78│   1·021│\r\n │Graphite, or uncombined carbon   │     ...│   0·871│    1·99│   2·641│\r\n │Silicon                          │    0·75│   1·124│    0·71│   3·061│\r\n │Sulphur                          │   trace│   2·516│   trace│   1·139│\r\n │Phosphorus                       │    0·12│   0·913│    1·23│   0·928│\r\n │Manganese                        │    5·38│   2·815│   trace│   0·834│\r\n └─────────────────────────────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that the last item in the table above is a\r\nsubstance that he has not yet made the acquaintance of, namely,\r\n_manganese_. This is a metal which in many of its chemical relations\r\nmuch resembles iron, and ferruginous ores usually contain a greater or\r\nless proportion of it. Manganese is of great importance in the\r\nmanufacture of steel, as we shall presently see; but as a separate metal\r\nit has no application, and is obtainable in the metallic state with much\r\ndifficulty. One of its oxides has however very extensive applications in\r\nthe chemical arts, and others form acid radicles, which in combination\r\nwith potash or soda give rise to useful products. The well-known\r\n“Condy’s fluid” is a solution of one of these.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how malleable iron or steely iron may be directly obtained\r\nfrom the ores, but it has been found that on the large scale it is\r\nnecessary and more economical to operate on the pig iron produced by the\r\nblast furnaces in such a manner as to remove the greater part of the\r\nforeign substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 19.—_Section of a Reverberatory Furnace._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first step in the conversion of the pig iron usually taken has been,\r\nand to a certain extent even is still, to remelt the metal in what is\r\ntermed a _finery furnace_, a kind of forge in which a charcoal fire is\r\nurged by a cold blast, and so regulated that an excess of oxygen is\r\nsupplied, or rather more than would suffice to convert all the carbon of\r\nthe fuel into carbonic acid; although this is perhaps not absolutely\r\nnecessary, as carbonic acid would itself supply oxygen by suffering\r\nreduction to carbonic oxide. At any rate the melted metal is exposed to\r\nan oxidizing atmosphere and constantly stirred. Many different\r\narrangements of the furnace and details of the process have been used.\r\nFor instance, where the finest quality of malleable iron was not aimed\r\nat, coke has been the fuel employed, and many shapes of furnaces, etc.,\r\nhave been contrived, and various additions of ores, oxides, etc., made\r\nto the charge, according to local practice and the nature of the crude\r\niron. One marked effect of the operation is the final removal of nearly\r\nall the _silicon_, which is burnt or oxidized into _silica_, and this at\r\nonce unites with oxide of iron, which is also formed, to produce a\r\nreadily fusible slag of silicate of iron, and in the production of this\r\nsilicate any sand attached to the pig will also take part. Much of the\r\ncarbon, amounting sometimes to more than half, is also eliminated as\r\ncarbonic oxide, and of what is left but little remains in the graphitic\r\nstate. The action on the phosphorus is usually less marked, but there is\r\nalways a notable reduction of the quantity. The sulphur is also lessened\r\nin some degree, although when coke is used, the fuel has the\r\ndisadvantage of itself containing sulphur, phosphates, and other\r\ndeleterious matters. Sometimes a little lime is added to the charge to\r\ntake up the sulphur from the coke. The operation lasts some hours, the\r\nfused metal being frequently stirred with an iron rod, until it assumes\r\na pasty granular condition, when the workman gradually collects it upon\r\nthe end of the rod into a ball of about three-quarters of a cwt. in\r\nweight. These balls, or _blooms_ as they are called, are removed from\r\nthe furnace while still intensely hot, and at once submitted to powerful\r\npressure by means of some suitable mechanical arrangement, the effect\r\nbeing to squeeze out the liquid slag and force the particles of metal\r\ntogether by which the whole becomes partially welded into a more compact\r\nmass. Then this mass is, while still hot, either hammered with gradually\r\nincreased force of the strokes, or in the more modern practice, passed\r\nbetween iron rollers (these we shall presently describe), by which it is\r\nshaped into a bar. The bars are afterwards cut into lengths, reheated\r\nwithout contact of fuel, again hammered or re-rolled; and this process\r\nis several times repeated when the best product is required. During the\r\nfirst treatment of the blooms, and also in the subsequent hammering or\r\nrolling, the oxygen of the atmosphere acts on the surface of the glowing\r\nmetal, so as to cover it with thin scales of oxide, and these, carried\r\ninto the interior of the mass, will give up their oxygen to any residual\r\nsilicon, carbon, etc., producing a little more slag, carbonic oxide,\r\nphosphate of iron, etc., which by the pressure of the hammers or rolls\r\nare ultimately forced out of the metal. It will be observed that in\r\nproducing the pig iron the chemical action is the separation of oxygen\r\nfrom the metal, while conversely an oxidizing action is set up in the\r\nfinery and subsequent treatment, in order to burn off the foreign\r\ningredients. But this cannot be done without at the same time\r\nre-oxidizing some of the iron itself, of which therefore there is always\r\na considerable loss, by its formation into slag (silicate), cinder,\r\nfoundry scale (oxide), etc. The quantity of iron lost depends of course\r\non many conditions, such as the care exercised in the operations, but it\r\noccurs in all the processes that have been devised for the conversion in\r\nquestion, even in the most modern: its amount may be taken to range\r\nbetween 10 and 20 per cent. The reader is requested to bear in mind the\r\nnature of the chemical actions that have just been described, for in\r\neven the most recently invented processes the principle is the same in\r\nnature and effect. So completely can the foreign elements be eliminated\r\nby this, or some analogous process, such as we shall presently mention,\r\nthat the finest Swedish bar iron contains more than 99½ per cent. of the\r\nmetal, and in some cases only a very little carbon and a mere trace of\r\nphosphorus remain, amounting together to less than 1 part in 2000. Such\r\nmetal is made from very pure ore, containing no sulphur and scarcely any\r\nphosphorus, while charcoal is the fuel used in all the operations. As\r\nalready mentioned, the objection to the use of coke is the sulphur,\r\nphosphates, and siliceous matters it contains. Toward the close of the\r\neighteenth century an invention came into use which obviated the\r\ndisadvantages of the cheaper fuel for converting crude iron. This was\r\nthe puddling furnace, brought into use after much experimenting by Henry\r\nCort in 1784. In it the pig iron is fused in a _reverberatory furnace_,\r\nthe form of which will be understood from Fig. 19, which is a diagram\r\nshowing such a furnace in section, where _f_ is the fire, _a_ an\r\naperture at which the fuel is introduced, _p_ the ash pit, _b_ is a low\r\nwall of refractory material called the “bridge,” over which the flame\r\npasses, and is by the low arched roof reflected or _reverberated_\r\ndownwards upon the charge, _c_, which is laid on a _hearth_, or iron\r\nfloor, having spaces below it where air circulates in order to prevent\r\nit becoming too hot. In Cort’s original arrangement the bed of the\r\nhearth was formed of sand, which gave rise to much inconvenience by\r\nproducing a quantity of the very fusible silicate of iron, that speedily\r\nattacked the masonry of the furnace, and therefore a very important\r\nimprovement was devised some years later by S. B. Rogers, who made the\r\nbed of his furnace of a layer of oxide of iron, spread on a cast iron\r\nplate 1½ inches thick. In later times it has become usual to cover the\r\niron hearth with certain other refractory mixtures varied according to\r\ncircumstances, of oxide, ore, cinder, lime, etc. There is one of these\r\nmixtures significantly designated “_bull-dog_” by the workmen. We may\r\nmention here that it has, in more recent times, when very high\r\ntemperatures are obtainable, been found unnecessary to cause even the\r\nflame to come into contact with the substances on the hearth, inasmuch\r\nas the heat radiated from the flame and the intensely heated roof of the\r\nfurnace suffices, so that in consequence of this the roofs are now\r\nconstructed nearly flat. In the puddling furnace the melted metal is\r\nconstantly stirred, and no little skill is required to regulate the fire\r\nby the damper on the chimney, and to admit the proper amount of air to\r\nmix with the flame. The pig iron softens and melts gradually, until at\r\nlength it becomes perfectly liquid, at which stage it swells up and\r\nappears to boil owing to the escape of carbonic oxide in numerous jets,\r\nwhich burn with the characteristic pale blue flame. The puddler then\r\nbriskly stirs the mass to cause more complete oxidation of the carbon,\r\nsilicon, etc., by bringing the superficially formed oxide of iron into\r\nthe interior. As the iron loses its carbon, it assumes much the texture\r\nof porridge, consisting of pasty lumps of malleable iron implexed with\r\nthe liquid slag (silicate of iron, etc.) which drips from the spongy\r\nballs as the puddler collects them at the end of his stirring rod, as in\r\nthe finery operation. The next thing is to run the mass immediately\r\nbetween powerful rolls (puddling rolls) by which the slag is squeezed\r\nout, as before, and finally through the _finishing rolls_ that shape it\r\ninto bars or plates.\r\n\r\nWhen a comparatively impure pig iron is used or when a better quality of\r\nmalleable metal is desired, the crude iron is submitted to a preliminary\r\ntreatment before puddling. This treatment, by a technical distinction,\r\ncalled _refinery_, is practically identical with the _finery_ process\r\nalready described, except that instead of being collected into blooms,\r\nthe fluid metal is run out to form a layer 2 or 3 inches thick, and\r\nthis, before becoming quite solid, is suddenly cooled by having water\r\nthrown over it, the result being a white, hard, brittle mass, which\r\nbroken into pieces is ready for the puddling furnace.\r\n\r\nThe operation that has been described is known as _hand puddling_, in\r\ncontradistinction to later methods in which it has been sought to\r\nsubstitute some form of machine that will produce the same result\r\nautomatically, such as revolving furnaces, etc. It has been found\r\ndifficult to maintain these in good working order, and in England at\r\nleast mechanical puddling has never found much favour, but in the great\r\niron works of Creusot, in France, large revolving furnaces were in use\r\nabout 1880, which could turn out 20 tons of converted iron in 24 hours,\r\nwhereas the old hand puddling furnaces could in the same period produce\r\nonly 2½ or 3 tons, with two sets of men, the puddler and one assistant.\r\nOf these mechanical furnaces it is unnecessary to give any account,\r\nespecially as the puddling process itself has nearly gone out of use,\r\nhaving been superseded by more economical methods.\r\n\r\nThe use of rolls for treating the product of the puddling furnace, and\r\nfor making it into bars, was also an invention of Henry Cort’s, for\r\nwhich he obtained a patent in 1783. This was in many respects an immense\r\nimprovement on the older system of hammering; it is still practised, and\r\nby it shapes can be given to the metal scarcely possible on the older\r\nsystem, while the tenacity of the metal is increased by the uniformity\r\ngiven to the grain. The difference of chemical composition between cast\r\nand wrought iron the reader has already been made acquainted with, and\r\nthere is quite as great a difference in their textures. The former, when\r\nbroken across, shows a distinctly crystalline structure, which we may\r\ncompare to that of loaf-sugar, while the latter exhibits grain, not\r\nunlike that of a piece of wood. This fibrous structure depends upon the\r\nmechanical treatment of the iron, and in rolled bars the fibres always\r\narrange themselves parallel to the length of the bar. Fig. 20 shows this\r\nfibrous structure in a piece of iron where a portion has been wrenched\r\noff. Like wood, wrought iron has much greater tenacity along the fibres\r\nthan across them; that is, a much less force is required to tear the\r\nfibres asunder than to break them transversely. Consequently, to obtain\r\nthe greatest advantage from the strength of wrought iron, the metal must\r\nbe so applied that the chief force may act upon it in the direction of\r\nthe fibres. Near the beginning of our article on IRON BRIDGES (_q.v._)\r\nthe reader will find some illustrations of the very different resisting\r\npowers of cast and wrought iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.—_Fibrous Fracture of Wrought Iron._\r\n]\r\n\r\nNothing in the way of inventions can be compared to those of Cort’s as\r\nto the effect they have had in promoting the iron industry, until we\r\nreach a period some years after the middle of our century; but we must\r\nnot neglect to recognize the scarcely inferior importance of Rogers’\r\nimprovement. Singularly enough, neither of these men reaped any benefit\r\nfrom his inventions. Cort died in the last year of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, quite a poor man, having been supported only by a niggardly\r\npension of some £160 from the Government, and leaving his family in\r\nindigent circumstances. Yet a most eminent authority on iron questions\r\n(Sir W. Fairbairn) estimated—some time about the middle of our era—that\r\nthe two inventions of Cort’s alone, the rolling-mill and the\r\nreverberatory puddling furnace, had by that time added to the wealth of\r\nGreat Britain by an amount equivalent to six hundred million pounds\r\nsterling. For many iron-masters had profited by these inventions,\r\namassing very great fortunes, in some instances also acquiring titles of\r\nhonour. Clearly to Cort and Rogers may be applied the _sic vos non\r\nvobis_ saying.\r\n\r\nWe shall now turn to the improvements that have been effected in the\r\nblast furnace, and of these none perhaps has been more marked than that\r\nmade by Neilson, when in 1828 he substituted heated air for the ordinary\r\ncold air that had before always supplied the blast. It will be\r\nremembered that the heat is due to the combination of only the oxygen of\r\nthe air with the carbon of the coke, but the greater part of the air—the\r\nfour-fifths of nitrogen—take no part in the action, beyond abstracting a\r\nlarge proportion of the heat; but when the air is heated to a high\r\ntemperature before entering the furnace, the cooling effect of the\r\nnitrogen is greatly obviated, and consequently a much higher temperature\r\nis obtained at the place of combustion, and the requisite intensity of\r\nheat is at once produced, which is most effective in completing the\r\nfusion and separation from each other of the slags and iron, and also in\r\naccomplishing the reduction of the oxide. But Neilson found that the net\r\nresult of burning some fuel to heat the air before entering the furnace\r\nwas a great economy of the total fuel required for smelting the ore. He\r\nhad to encounter many difficulties in carrying his invention into\r\npractice; the iron ovens first used for heating the air were rapidly\r\noxidized; and when thick cast iron pipes were substituted, these were\r\nliable to leak at the joints on account of the expansions and\r\ncontractions caused by changes of temperature. Then the new invention\r\nhad as usual to contend with established prejudices and misconceptions;\r\nbut it soon came into use in Scotland, where it effected a great saving;\r\ninasmuch as it was found possible to use with the hot blast raw coal of\r\na certain kind, plentiful in Scotland, because the heat retained by the\r\nascending gases sufficed to convert the coal at the top of the charge\r\ninto coke.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the active agent in the reduction of the ore\r\nis the carbonic oxide gas formed by the incomplete combustion of the\r\ncarbon of the fuel; or what comes to the same thing, the absorption by\r\ncarbonic acid first produced of another proportion of carbon. The carbon\r\noxide robs the iron oxide of its oxygen to become itself changed into\r\ncarbonic acid. In reality however the action is more complex than this\r\nin its chemical relations; for instance, metallic iron will under\r\ncertain circumstances act conversely on carbonic acid, and rob it of\r\nhalf its oxygen. The net result of the reactions between carbon, iron,\r\niron oxide, and these gases depends mainly upon the temperature and\r\npressure and upon the relative quantities of each substance present. In\r\nthe gases escaping from the blast furnace there is always a large\r\nquantity (nearly one-third) of carbonic oxide. At the blast furnaces in\r\nwork during the first half of our century the combustible gases were\r\nallowed to burn to waste as they issued from the top of the furnace, in\r\nthe manner shown in Fig. 17, and at night the flames used to form a\r\nweird and striking feature in the prospect of an iron-smelting region.\r\n\r\nInstead of allowing the escaping gases to burn to waste, it became the\r\npractice about 1860, and so continues, to draw them off and burn them\r\nunder steam boilers or use their flames for heating the blast. An\r\neffective method of withdrawing the gases is shown in Fig. 21, which is\r\na section through the upper part of a smelting furnace, with the “cup\r\nand cone” arrangement. The mouth of the furnace is covered by a shallow\r\niron cone _a_, open at the bottom, into which fits another cone _b_,\r\nattached to a chain _c_, sustained by an arm of the lever _d_, which is\r\nfirmly held in position by the chain _e_, and is also provided with a\r\ncounterpoise _f_. When the mouth of the furnace is thus closed, the\r\ngases find an exit by the opening _g_, seen behind the cones, and\r\nleading into a downward passage, through which they are drawn by the\r\ndraught of a tall chimney to the place where they are burnt. The charge\r\nfor the furnace is filled into the hopper _a_, and at the proper time\r\nthe chain, _e_, is slackened when the weight of the material resting on\r\nthe suspended cone overcomes that of the counterpoise, and the charge\r\nslides down over the surface of the cone _b_, which is immediately drawn\r\nup again by the counterpoise, so that the opening into the air is at\r\nonce closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 21.—_Cup and Cone._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe march of improvement in the blast furnace has been characterized\r\nparticularly in Britain and the United States by a great increase of\r\ndimensions, which is found to promote economy in fuel, etc. In the\r\nformer country the furnace of the latter part of our century is commonly\r\nfrom 70 to 80 feet high, and some have even been built with a height of\r\nmore than 100 feet, while in the States the tendency to build very high\r\nfurnaces is still more marked. A single large furnace may turn out as\r\nmuch as 1,500 tons of pig iron in a week, and some in America, it is\r\nsaid, actually produce as much as 2,500 tons. The more usual output of a\r\nblast furnace is however much less than these amounts; but if we say\r\nonly one-half, or even one-third of these quantities, a state of things\r\nis indicated very different from what obtained about 1837, when the best\r\nWelsh furnaces produced only 200 tons a week. If we go back to the\r\nbeginning of the century, the difference is much more marked, for the\r\nblast furnaces of that period could turn out only about 30 tons in a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of fuel, ore, and limestone charged into the furnace\r\nvary greatly according to the composition of the ore, the quality of\r\niron aimed at, and the practice of each manufacturer. It is usual\r\npreviously to calcine the carbonate ores and others also, in order to\r\nexpel the carbonic acid and the moisture, of which last all contain a\r\nconsiderable amount: and sometimes the limestone is mixed with the ore\r\nto undergo this preliminary process. The charge being conveyed from the\r\nroasting kilns to the blast furnace while still hot effects an obvious\r\neconomy of fuel in the latter. In the case of hæmatite ore the\r\nquantities of materials in one charge may be something like 54 cwt. of\r\nore, 9 cwt. of limestone, and 33 cwt. of coke. It is quite common to use\r\nmixtures of different kinds of ore, so as to modify the quality of the\r\nproduct according to particular requirements. The use of the limestone\r\nis to take up silica, and the slag is found to consist mainly of\r\nsilicates of lime and alumina. The amount flowing from a blast furnace\r\nof course varies much according to the conditions, and is larger than\r\nwould commonly be supposed; for the production of one ton of pig iron\r\ninvolves the production of from ½ to 1½ tons of slag.\r\n\r\nFig. 22 represents in section the later type of blast furnace, which of\r\ncourse is circular in plan. Its height may be taken as 80 feet, and the\r\ndiameter at the widest part of the interior as 22½ feet, narrowed to 20\r\nfeet near the top. The lowest portion, C, is called the _crucible_, the\r\nbottom of which is the _hearth_, both formed of the most refractory\r\nmaterials obtainable. The conical widening, B, above the crucible is the\r\n_boshes_, and at the top is seen the “cup and cone” apparatus already\r\ndescribed, A, surmounted by the short cylindrical iron mouth, through\r\napertures in which the charges are tipped from the gallery, D, these\r\nhaving been raised there in small trucks by hydraulic or other\r\nelevators. The escaping gases leave the furnace by the exit, E, which\r\nleads into the “down-come,” G, and they are conducted from it to the\r\n“regenerative stoves” and dealt with as presently to be described. Our\r\nsection represents the masonry of the furnace as sustained by pillars,\r\nP, at the outside of the lower part; these pillars support a strong ring\r\nof iron plates upon which the wall rests. This arrangement has the\r\nadvantage of allowing the workmen the greatest freedom of access to\r\nparts about the crucible, which require much attention. Here, at the\r\nlowest part, is an aperture from which the liquid iron is allowed to run\r\nout every five or six hours, it being plugged in the meantime by clay\r\nand sand. The slag being much lighter than the iron, floats above it,\r\nand runs off at a higher level over the _tympstone_. Opening into the\r\nhearth are several orifices to admit the hot blast from the nozzles of\r\nthe _tuyères_, which of course do not project into the furnace itself;\r\nbut they are so near to the region of intensest heat that they would be\r\nrapidly destroyed unless they were surrounded by a casing through which\r\na current of water is constantly running. The _tuyères_, of which there\r\nmay be 3 or 5, are supplied from the pipe seen at K. The earlier plans\r\nof heating the air did not permit of a very high temperature being given\r\nto the hot blast, about 600° F. being the limit; but the “regenerative”\r\nstoves can supply a blast of more than 1,600° F., or not far below the\r\nmelting point of silver. Another great increase has been in the pressure\r\nof the blast; 2 or 3 lbs. per square inch sufficed in the earlier\r\npractice; but the lofty modern furnaces have to be supplied with the\r\nblast at a pressure of 10 lbs. per square inch, and over. Even when\r\ncomparatively low pressures were the rule, a large ironworks required\r\nmuch blowing power. The works formerly at Dowlais, in South Wales, for\r\ninstance, had an engine of 650 horse-power for the blowing engine, in\r\nwhich a piston of 12 feet diameter moved in a cylinder 12 feet in\r\nlength. The quantity of air that passes into a blast furnace amounts to\r\nthousands of tons per week, its weight being much greater than that of\r\nall the ore, coke, and limestone put together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—_Section of Blast Furnace._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be said that great care and expense are bestowed on the\r\nconstruction of these furnaces. Only the best and most refractory\r\nmaterials, such as firebricks, are used for the lining, and the exterior\r\nis a casing of solid masonry, strengthened with iron bands. When a new\r\nfurnace is finished it takes a month or six weeks to put it into\r\noperation; but when this is done it will remain in action night and day\r\ncontinuously for a long period—perhaps for eight or ten years—before the\r\nnecessity for repairs requires a “blow out.” And the blow out and\r\nrestarting, without the cost of repairs, entail an outlay of several\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThe gases leaving the throat of the furnace consist mainly of nitrogen\r\nand a little carbonic acid, together with about one-third of their\r\nvolume of the combustible gases, carbonic oxide, and some hydrogen; but\r\nthese last do not leave the furnace in an ignited state, because the\r\noxygen there has already been consumed. They are conducted by the\r\n“down-come” pipe, G, Fig. 22, to a point at which, by means of a valve,\r\nthey can be directed to one or other of two circular towers entirely\r\nfilled with firebricks, arranged chequerwise, so as to form innumerable\r\npassages between them. The furnace gases are admitted at the bottom of\r\nthe Cowper tower, or “regenerative stove,” into a flue to which a\r\nregulated quantity of air has access, and there they are fired: the\r\nflame ascending the flue to the upper part of the tower, thence\r\ndescends, communicating its heat to the firebricks, which soon acquire a\r\nvery high temperature, especially where the flame first enters, and the\r\nburnt gases leave the tower for a tall chimney, leaving most of their\r\nheat in the firebricks. When this action has continued for a sufficient\r\ntime, the connection of the regenerator with the throat of the furnace\r\nis cut off, and the escaping gases are directed into the other\r\nregenerator, and at the same time the blast from the blowing engine is\r\nmade to ascend among the firebricks of the first, where gaining\r\nincreasing temperature as it ascends—the stove being hottest at the\r\ntop—the air leaves the tower to be conducted to the _tuyères_ at such\r\nhigh temperature as already mentioned. While the one regenerator is thus\r\nheating the blast, the other is in its turn accumulating heat from the\r\nflames of the escaping gases; and thus they are worked alternately, the\r\naction being constantly reversed after suitable intervals.\r\n\r\nWhen iron is combined with a much smaller proportion of carbon than in\r\ncast iron, and contains little or no graphitic or uncombined carbon, we\r\nhave the very useful compound known as steel. In the earlier half of the\r\ncentury it was customary to distinguish steel from malleable iron on the\r\none hand, and cast iron on the other. If the compound contained from 0·5\r\nto 1·5 per cent. of carbon, it was called steel by some authorities,\r\nwhile others extended these limits a little on either side. Later it was\r\nfound that the presence of elements other than carbon can confer steely\r\nproperties on iron, and indeed it is possible to have a metal containing\r\nno carbon, but possessing the characteristic properties of steel. Sir\r\nJoseph Whitworth proposed to classify a piece of metal according to its\r\ntensile strength, without any regard to either its chemical composition\r\nor its mode of manufacture: if it could not bear more than 30 tons per\r\nsquare inch it should be considered iron, but if it had a higher tensile\r\nstrength, it should then be regarded as steel. To estimate the\r\nengineering value a figure depending upon the elongation or stretching\r\nof the specimen before breaking was to be added to the number of tons of\r\nthe breaking load. This stretching power of steel is in some cases of as\r\nmuch importance as the tensile strength: the ordnance maker, for\r\ninstance, considers a steel with a breaking strength of 53 tons under an\r\nelongation of 5 per cent. as _for his purposes_ to be rejected: while a\r\nspecimen showing a breaking strain of only 30 tons along with an\r\nelongation of 35 per cent., on 2 inches of length, he will regard as\r\ngood. The tensile strength of steel depends in part on its composition,\r\nin part on the mode of manufacture, and in part on the subsequent\r\ntreatment. The _average_ tensile strength of a wrought iron bar per\r\nsquare inch of section is about 25 tons (30 is the maximum); while the\r\nlike average for steel is 43 tons, and some kinds of cast steel will\r\nbear nearly 60 tons. Steel bars of a certain temper subjected by Sir\r\nJoseph Whitworth to a process of hardening in oil showed a tensile\r\nstrength of even 90 tons per square inch. These figures will suffice to\r\nshow the great utility of steel in structures and machines. But steel\r\nhas besides a characteristic property which makes it extremely valuable\r\nin a great variety of applications, namely, its capability of being\r\n_tempered_. If a piece of steel is heated to dull redness and suddenly\r\ncooled by plunging it into cold water, it becomes so extremely hard that\r\nit cannot be acted on by a file; nay, its hardness may be made to rival\r\nthat of the diamond, which is the hardest substance known. Now by a\r\nsecond operation this hardness can be reduced to any required degree:\r\nthis is done by re-heating the metal to a certain moderate degree\r\nbetween 430° F. and 630° F. and again cooling it by immersion in some\r\ncooling medium. In this “letting down” process, it is the highest\r\ntemperature that produces the greatest softening, and the properties of\r\nthe tempered steel will depend upon the precise degree to which the\r\nmetal has been reheated. For example, if the product be required for\r\nmaking into sword blades, or watch-springs, and to possess much\r\nelasticity, the proper temperature is between 550° F. and 570° F.; but\r\nif the steel is to be suitable for saws the temperature must range\r\nwithin a few degrees of 600° F., according to the fineness of the tool\r\nintended; a lower temperature would give a metal too hard for them to be\r\nsharpened with a file. On the other hand, sharp cutting instruments and\r\ntools for working metals are obtained hard by tempering at lower degrees\r\nthan springs. In practice the index of the temperature is taken from the\r\ncolour of the film of oxide that gradually forms on a polished surface\r\nof the metal as the heat is raised, and begins by a very pale yellow (at\r\n430° F.), passing through deeper shades into brown, then through purple\r\ninto deep blue (at 570° F.), etc. The reader will now see why watch and\r\nclock springs have their deep blue colour, and he can observe for\r\nhimself the whole series of colours by very gradually heating a piece of\r\npolished steel over a small flame.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the chemical composition of wrought iron and of cast iron\r\nwith that of steel as regards the content of carbon, we see at once that\r\nsteel holds an intermediate position, so that if in the puddling furnace\r\nwe could arrest the decarbonization at a certain point we should obtain\r\nsteel; or if, on the other hand, we could put back into chemical\r\ncombination with the decarbonized wrought iron a due percentage of\r\ncarbon we should in that way also obtain steel. And it will be observed\r\nthat the oldest primitive furnaces could not have failed sometimes to\r\nhave produced steel as the net or final result of such actions. In fact,\r\nsteel always has been and still is produced on one or other of these two\r\nprinciples, applied in divers ways, but severally and distinctly\r\ndirected to that end. Of the many more or less modified processes of\r\nsteel-making that have been in use, we need here but briefly mention a\r\nfew which were _the_ processes of the first sixty years of our century,\r\nand are to a considerable extent still in operation, although eclipsed\r\nin importance by two other processes that, since the date referred to,\r\nhave been supplying the metal in enormously increased quantities, and\r\nwhich will have to be particularly described.\r\n\r\nThe most usual of the older processes of steel-making, still carried on\r\nat Sheffield and elsewhere, is known as the _cementation process_: it\r\nconsists in heating bars of the best wrought iron in contact with\r\ncharcoal, at a high temperature, for three or four weeks. At Sheffield\r\nthe iron bars and charcoal are packed in alternate layers into troughs\r\n14 ft. long by 3½ ft. deep and wide, constructed of slabs of siliceous\r\nsandstone 6 in. thick. The last layer of charcoal at the top is covered\r\nto a certain depth with a layer of refractory matter, and the flames\r\nfrom a furnace beneath are made to envelop the stone troughs or _pots_,\r\nas they are technically called, for a period of a week or more according\r\nto the thickness of the bars operated upon. These are generally 3 in.\r\nbroad and from five- to six-eighths of an inch thick. When it is found\r\nby withdrawing a test bar for examination that the operation is\r\ncomplete, the fire is gradually diminished and the whole allowed to cool\r\nslowly, which requires about a fortnight. Instead of only charcoal, a\r\nmixture of powdered charcoal or soot with a little salt has been used by\r\nsome makers—which mixture, technically called _cement powder_, has given\r\nits name to the process. In some works 16 tons or more of iron are\r\ntreated in one operation. The bars are found unchanged in form, but\r\nincreased in weight by perhaps 27 lbs. per ton, for carbon has combined\r\nwith the iron, being apparently transferred in the iron from one\r\nparticle to another. The surface of the bars becomes rough and uneven\r\nfrom a multitude of blebs or blisters, and hence they are called\r\n_blister bars_, and the steel of which they now consist is named\r\n_blister steel_. In this conversion we may suppose that the iron at its\r\nouter surface first enters into combination with carbon taken from the\r\ncarbonic oxide gas, which would be produced by combustion of the\r\ncharcoal with the limited quantity of air in its interstices, and the\r\noxygen thus set free would immediately seize again on the surrounding\r\ncharcoal, and by repeated changes of this kind in which the oxygen acts\r\nas a carrier of carbon to the iron, in which it is transferred inwards\r\nfrom particle to particle. The cause of the blisters has been much\r\ndiscussed: probably the cause is the formation and escape of a volatile\r\ncompound of carbon and sulphur at the surface of the soft metal; for it\r\nis known that nearly the whole of the little sulphur in the wrought iron\r\ndisappears in the cementation process. Blister steel is never\r\nhomogeneous, for near the surface it always contains more carbon than\r\nwithin; the bars are therefore broken up into short lengths which are\r\ncarefully assorted, bound together with wire, heated, welded together\r\nunder a hammer or by rolling, and finally formed into a bar, which is\r\nstamped with the outline of a pair of shears, and is then known as\r\n_shear steel_, because this product was generally found the most\r\nsuitable for making the shears used in dressing cloth.\r\n\r\nAnother method of dealing with the blister steel is to charge crucibles\r\nor pots having covers with 50 or 100 lbs. weight of the broken-up bars,\r\nand subject the crucibles to a strong heat in a reverberatory furnace,\r\nwhen the metal melts, and at the proper moment the contents of a great\r\nnumber of pots are almost simultaneously poured into a mould to form an\r\n_ingot_. The result is a very uniform steel of the finest texture, known\r\nand highly esteemed as _cast steel_ or _crucible steel_. This steel is\r\nmuch more fusible than iron, but less so than cast iron.\r\n\r\nThe production of steel by arresting at a certain stage the\r\ndecarbonizing of cast iron in the puddling furnace requires much\r\nexperience on the part of the workman, who has to learn when the desired\r\npoint has been reached by certain indications, such as the appearance of\r\nthe flame, or by the examination of a small sample of the fluid metal\r\nwithdrawn and rapidly cooled. Various additions to the charge in\r\ndefinite proportions are generally made, such as scales of iron oxide,\r\nor a quantity of an oxide ore (hæmatite, etc.) or other materials, the\r\nmost essential for a good product consisting of a little manganese in\r\nsome form. The result is _puddled steel_; and this, like blister steel,\r\ncan be converted into cast steel by fusion in crucibles, running into\r\ningot moulds, and subsequent treatment by hammering, pressing, rolling,\r\netc. In 1864 puddled steel was described as an article of great\r\ncommercial importance, but this it soon lost by the introduction of\r\nsimpler, cheaper, and more reliable processes. The methods and\r\nimprovements proposed for the production of steel have been exceedingly\r\nnumerous, as is shown by the records of the English Patent Office alone,\r\nwhich contain up to the end of 1856 specifications of ninety-two patents\r\nfor different steel-manufacturing processes, while from 1857 to 1865,\r\nthe epoch-marking period of steel making, seventy-four more patents were\r\nobtained for this purpose. It would be quite beyond our limits to make\r\nspecial reference to these, and to the numerous patents which have since\r\nbeen granted, but there is one of great importance in steel-making which\r\nmust be mentioned, and that is the patent for the employment in the\r\ncementation process of carbide of manganese, taken out by J. M. Heath in\r\n1839. This made England almost independent of the former large\r\nimportations of Swedish and Russian iron, and it caused an immediate\r\nreduction of £40 in the price per ton of good steel, effecting a saving\r\nwhich up to 1855 is calculated at not less than £2,000,000. Heath was\r\none of those who fail to benefit by their inventions, for his was boldly\r\nappropriated by another person who took advantage of a verbal flaw in\r\nthe specification, and Heath did not obtain any redress from the law\r\ncourts until, after ten years’ litigation, a majority of Exchequer\r\njudges reversed all the previous decisions against him (1853). In the\r\nmeantime the man had died, but as the patent was about to expire his\r\nwidow was on petition granted an extension of it for seven years. The\r\nnature of the influence of manganese on steel-making has not been fully\r\nexplained, and there is some diversity of opinion on the subject, as it\r\nis said—on the one hand, merely to remove or counteract the injurious\r\neffects of sulphur or phosphorus; on the other, to impart to the steel\r\ngreater ductility, strength, and power of welding, tempering, etc.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of _crucible_ or _cast steel_ has been carried on at\r\nEssen in Prussia by the firm of A. Krupp & Co., on a scale surpassing\r\nanything attempted elsewhere,—theirs being the largest steel-works in\r\nthe world, and remarkable for the variety and excellence of its\r\nproducts. It began in so small a way that it is said only a single\r\nworkman was employed. To the Great Exhibition of 1851, at London,\r\nKrupp’s firm sent a block of crucible cast steel weighing 2¼ tons, a\r\nlarger mass of the metal than had ever been shown before, and looked\r\nupon with no little astonishment, for at that time steel was a precious\r\ncommodity, the price of refined steel ranging from £45 to £60 per ton.\r\nAt the next London Exhibition, in 1862, the Essen Works showed a block\r\nof cast steel 20 tons in weight, and at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873,\r\none of 52 tons. This casting, which was first made of a cylindrical\r\nshape, was forged into an octagonal form under an immense steam-hammer,\r\nlarger than the Woolwich hammer described on a previous page, for the\r\nweight of the moving part is no less than 50 tons. This huge mass of\r\ncast steel was of the finest quality; the forging into the prismatic\r\nform was to show its malleability, for it was intended for the body of a\r\ngun to have a bore of 14 inches. Since the period referred to, ingots of\r\nmore than 100 tons have been cast. That shown at Vienna was the product\r\nof some 1,800 crucibles, each containing 65 lbs. of melted steel, which\r\nhad to be poured into the mould in a regular and continuous stream, so\r\nthat the metal might solidify into a perfectly uniform mass. Such work\r\ncan be done only by trained men, who act in regular ranks with military\r\nprecision, and in pairs emptying their crucibles into channels\r\npreviously assigned, then filing off to the other end of the rank to\r\nreceive another crucible, while the pair of men who were behind are\r\npouring out theirs, and so on in succession. The crucibles are emptied\r\ninto a number of channels formed of iron lined with fire-clay, and\r\nleading down into the mould. Many precautions have to be taken to ensure\r\nthe regular progress of the operations, and all the time required to\r\nfill the huge moulds may be counted by minutes.\r\n\r\nThe headpiece to our chapter on Fire-Arms gives but a very inadequate\r\nidea of the magnitude of the Essen Works about 1870. A better notion\r\nwill be obtained from a few figures which we select from a list giving\r\nsome of the contents of the Essen Works in 1876. There were 1,109\r\nfurnaces of various kinds, of which 250 were for smelting; 77 steam\r\nhammers, 294 steam engines, 18 rolling mills, 365 turning lathes, and\r\n700 other machine tools; 24 miles of ordinary gauge railway for traffic\r\nwithin the works; together with 10 miles of narrow gauge railway; 38\r\nmiles of telegraph lines, with 45 Morse apparatus, etc. (J. S. Jeans’\r\n_Steel: its History, etc._, 1880). These figures belong, be it observed,\r\nto the state of things in 1876; but we learn from a later authority that\r\nin 1894 these works employed 15,000 men, and we must suppose that the\r\nplant has been proportionately increased since the earlier period, when\r\n10,000 men were employed.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1854 a regular system of records began to be kept of the\r\namounts of coal and ores raised in Great Britain, and also of the\r\nquantities of the various metals produced. These show that in 1894 very\r\nnearly three times as much coal was raised as in 1854, and that in the\r\nsame period the quantity of British pig iron smelted annually had\r\nincreased four-fold; these increases look small when compared with the\r\nexpansion of the steel production in Britain within the same period of\r\nforty years, for this had enlarged _thirty-fold_. This extraordinary\r\ndevelopment is attributable to the introduction of two processes by\r\neither of which various steels of excellent quality, and adapted to a\r\ngreat range of applications, can be produced cheaply and with certainty.\r\nThese processes are respectively known as the Bessemer and the Open\r\nHearth, and the reader should observe that with the main principles\r\ninvolved in these he has already been made acquainted.\r\n\r\nHenry Bessemer, who first saw the light in England in 1813, may be said\r\nto have been born an inventor, for his father was one before him—a\r\nFrenchman employed in the royal mint at Paris, afterwards appointed by\r\nthe Revolutionary authorities to superintend a public bakery; on an\r\naccusation of giving short weight, thrown into prison, from which, and\r\nprobably from the guillotine, he escaped, and found employment in the\r\nEnglish mint. Subsequently he devised some notable improvements in the\r\nart of producing letterpress type, and for many years carried on a\r\nprosperous business as a typefounder. The son developed inventive\r\nfaculties at a very early age: in lathe engraving, dies, dating stamps,\r\netc. His name became familiar to everyone by his production of the\r\nmetallic powder long known as “Bessemer’s Gold Paint.” It became known\r\nto Bessemer that the raw material of this substance, which was then sold\r\nat £5, 10_s._ per lb., really cost only about one shilling per lb., and\r\nhe set himself to discover its composition and mode of manufacture. He\r\nsucceeded in this so well that he could produce the article at the\r\ninsignificant cost of four shillings a pound, and his first order for a\r\nsupply of it was at the rate of £4 per lb., and the business was\r\ncontinued, realising profits of something like 1,000 per cent. at first.\r\nFor this article no patent was taken out, but Bessemer himself, assisted\r\nby two trustworthy workmen, carried on the manufacture in secret, and he\r\nsome time afterwards rewarded the fidelity of his men by handing over\r\nthe business to them as a free gift. Then he took out patents for\r\nimprovements in the manufacture of oils, varnishes, sugar, plate glass,\r\netc. Several of his machines for these purposes were shown at the London\r\nExhibition of 1851. Bessemer is said to have obtained altogether some\r\n150 patents, including those granted for inventions connected with our\r\nsubject. He may be regarded as the type of the very fortunate inventor,\r\nsince on the patents of the one process we are going to describe he\r\nultimately obtained royalties to the value of more than £1,057,000, and\r\nthis irrespective of profits derived from commercially working it\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Crimean War, Bessemer had some experiments made at\r\nVincennes with cylindrical projectiles he had devised for firing from\r\nsmooth-bore guns, yet so as to impart to the projectile at the same time\r\nrotation about its axis. The experiments were successful, but it was\r\npointed out that the guns of cast iron then in use would not bear heavy\r\nprojectiles, and he was induced, at the suggestion of the Emperor\r\nNapoleon III., to undertake some researches with the view of finding\r\nmetal more suitable for artillery. Bessemer, having then little\r\nknowledge of the metallurgy of iron, applied himself on his return to\r\nEngland to the study of the best books on the subject, visited the\r\nprincipal iron-working districts, and began a series of experiments at a\r\nsmall experimental installation he set up in London. There, after\r\nrepeated failures, he did at length succeed in producing a metal much\r\ntougher than the cast iron then used, and a small model gun was\r\nsubmitted to the Emperor, who encouraged Bessemer to persevere with his\r\nexperiments; which he did, though the expense was a great tax on his\r\ncapital, continued as the experiments were for two years and a half. But\r\nby this time he had acquired a knowledge of many important facts, and\r\nthese gradually led him to the experimental realization of the idea he\r\nhad conceived, but only after many trials in which several thousand\r\npounds were expended. At length the agenda of the British Association\r\nfor the Cheltenham meeting of 1856 announced that a paper would be read\r\nby H. Bessemer, entitled “The Manufacture of Iron and Steel without\r\nFuel.” It will be easily understood that a title in such terms would\r\ngive rise to much derisive incredulity; and we may imagine the\r\niron-masters on that occasion crowding into Section G, while asking each\r\nother in the spirit of certain philosophers of old, “What will this\r\nbabbler say?” Some of what he did say may here be quoted, as at once\r\nexplanatory and historically memorable.\r\n\r\n“I set out with the assumption that crude iron contains about 5 per\r\ncent. of carbon; that carbon cannot exist at a white heat in the\r\npresence of oxygen without uniting therewith and producing combustion;\r\nthat such combustion would proceed with a rapidity dependent on the\r\namount of surface of carbon exposed; and lastly, that the temperature\r\nwhich the metal would acquire would be also dependent on the rapidity\r\nwith which the oxygen and carbon were made to combine; and consequently,\r\nthat it was only necessary to bring the oxygen and carbon together in\r\nsuch a manner that a vast surface should be exposed to their mutual\r\naction, in order to produce a temperature hitherto unattainable in our\r\nlargest furnaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.—_Experiments at Baxter House._\r\n]\r\n\r\n“With a view of testing practically this theory, I constructed a\r\ncylindrical vessel of 3 ft. in diameter and 5 ft. in height, somewhat\r\nlike an ordinary cupola furnace (see Fig. 23). The interior is lined\r\nwith firebricks, and at about 2 in. from the bottom of it I inserted\r\nfive _tuyère_ pipes, the nozzles of which are formed of well-burned\r\nfire-clay, the orifice of each _tuyère_ being about three-eighths of an\r\ninch in diameter; they are so put into the brick lining (from the outer\r\nside) as to admit of their removal and renewal in a few minutes, when\r\nthey are worn out. At one side of the vessel, about half-way up from the\r\nbottom, there is a hole made for running-in the crude metal, and on the\r\nopposite side there is a tap-hole, stopped with loam, by means of which\r\nthe iron is run out at the end of the process. In practice this\r\nconverting vessel may be made of any convenient size, but I prefer that\r\nit should not hold less than one nor more than five tons of fluid iron\r\nat each charge; the vessel should be placed so near to the discharge\r\nhole of the blast furnace as to allow the iron to flow along a gutter\r\ninto it. A small blast cylinder is required capable of compressing air\r\nto about 8 lbs. or 10 lbs. to the square inch. A communication having\r\nbeen made between it and the _tuyères_ before named, the converting\r\nvessel will be in a condition to commence work; it will however on the\r\noccasion of its first being used after re-lining with firebricks be\r\nnecessary to make a fire in the interior with a few baskets of coke, so\r\nas to dry the brickwork and heat up the vessel for the first operation,\r\nafter which the fire is to be all carefully raked out at the\r\ntapping-hole, which is again to be made good with loam: the vessel will\r\nthen be in readiness to commence work, and may be so continued without\r\nany use of fuel until the brick lining, in the course of time, becomes\r\nworn away, and a new lining is required. I have before mentioned that\r\nthe _tuyères_ are situated nearly close to the bottom of the vessel, the\r\nfluid metal will therefore rise some 18 in. or 2 ft. above them; it is\r\ntherefore necessary, in order to prevent the metal from entering the\r\n_tuyère_ holes, to turn on the blast before allowing the fluid crude\r\niron to run into the vessel from the blast furnace. This having been\r\ndone, and the metal run in, a rapid boiling up of the metal will be\r\nheard going on within the vessel, the metal being tossed violently about\r\nand dashed from side to side, shaking the vessel by the force with which\r\nit moves; from the throat of the converting vessel flame will\r\nimmediately issue, accompanied by a few bright sparks such as are always\r\nseen rising from the metal when running into the pig-beds. This state of\r\nthings will continue for about fifteen minutes, during which time the\r\noxygen in the atmospheric air combines with the carbon contained in the\r\niron, producing carbonic oxide, or carbonic acid gas, and at the same\r\ntime evolving a powerful heat. Now, as this heat is generated in the\r\ninterior of, and is diffused in innumerable fiery bubbles through, the\r\nwhole fluid mass, the metal absorbs the greater part of it, and its\r\ntemperature becomes immensely increased, and by the expiration of the\r\nfifteen minutes before named that part of the carbon which appears\r\nmechanically mixed and diffused throughout the crude iron has been\r\nentirely consumed: the temperature however is so high that the\r\nchemically combined carbon now begins to separate from the metal, as is\r\nat once indicated by an immense increase in the volume of flame rushing\r\nout of the throat of the vessel. The metal in the vessel now rises\r\nseveral inches above its natural level, and a light frothy slag makes\r\nits appearance and is thrown out in large foam-like masses. This violent\r\neruption of cinder generally lasts about five or six minutes, when all\r\nfurther appearance of it ceases, a steady and powerful flame replacing\r\nthe shower of sparks and cinder which always accompanies the boil. The\r\nrapid union of carbon and oxygen which thus takes place adds still\r\nfurther to the temperature of the metal, while the diminished quantity\r\nof carbon present allows a part of the oxygen to combine with the iron,\r\nwhich undergoes combustion and is converted into an oxide. At the\r\nexcessive temperature that the metal has now acquired, the oxide as soon\r\nas formed undergoes fusion, and forms a powerful solvent of those earthy\r\nbases that are associated with the iron; the violent ebullition which is\r\ngoing on mixes most intimately the scoria and metal, every part of which\r\nis thus brought in contact with the fluid oxide, which will thus wash\r\nand cleanse the metal most thoroughly from the silicon and other earthy\r\nbases which are combined with the crude iron, while the sulphur and\r\nother volatile matters which cling so tenaciously to iron at ordinary\r\ntemperatures are driven off, the sulphur combining with the oxygen and\r\nforming sulphurous acid gas.\r\n\r\n“The loss in weight of crude iron during its conversion into an ingot of\r\nmalleable iron was found, on a mean of four experiments, to be 12½ per\r\ncent., to which will have to be added the loss of metal in the finishing\r\nrolls. This will make the entire loss probably not less than 18 per\r\ncent. instead of about 28 per cent., which is the loss on the present\r\nsystem. A large portion of this metal is however recoverable by heating\r\nwith carbonaceous gases the rich oxides thrown out of the furnace during\r\nthe boil. These slags are found to contain innumerable small grains of\r\nmetallic iron, which are mechanically held in suspension in the slags\r\nand may be easily recovered.\r\n\r\n“I have before mentioned that after the boil has taken place a steady\r\nand powerful flame succeeds, which continues without any change for\r\nabout ten or twelve minutes, when it rapidly falls off. As soon as this\r\ndiminution of flame is apparent the workman will know that the process\r\nis completed, and that the crude iron has been converted into pure\r\nmalleable iron, which he will form into ingots of any suitable size and\r\nshape by simply opening the tap-hole of the converting vessel and\r\nallowing the fluid malleable iron to flow into the iron ingot moulds\r\nplaced there to receive it. The masses of iron thus formed will be free\r\nfrom any admixture of cinder, oxide, or other extraneous matters, and\r\nwill be far more pure and in a forwarder state of manufacture than a\r\npile formed of ordinary puddle bars. And thus it will be seen that by a\r\nsingle process, requiring no manipulation or particular skill, and with\r\nonly one workman, from three to five tons of crude iron pass into the\r\ncondition of several piles of malleable iron in from thirty to\r\nthirty-five minutes, with the expenditure of about a third part the\r\nblast now used in a finery furnace, with an equal charge of iron, and\r\nwith the consumption of no other fuel than is contained in the crude\r\niron.\r\n\r\n“To those who are best acquainted with the nature of fluid iron, it may\r\nbe a matter of surprise that a blast of cold air forced into melted\r\ncrude iron is capable of raising its temperature to such a degree as to\r\nretain it in a perfect state of fluidity after it has lost all its\r\ncarbon and is in the condition of malleable iron, which, in the highest\r\nheat of our forges, only becomes softened into a pasty mass. But such is\r\nthe excessive temperature that I am enabled to arrive at with a properly\r\nshaped converting vessel and a judicious distribution of the blast, that\r\nI am enabled not only to retain the fluidity of the metal, but to create\r\nso much surplus heat as to remelt all the crop-ends, ingot-runners, and\r\nother scrap that is made throughout the process, and thus bring them,\r\nwithout labour or fuel, into ingots of a quality equal to the rest of\r\nthe charge of new metal....\r\n\r\n“To persons conversant with the manufacture of iron, it will be at once\r\napparent that the ingots of the malleable metal which I have described\r\nwill have no hard or steely parts, such as are found in puddled iron,\r\nrequiring a great amount of rolling to blend them with the general mass,\r\nnor will such ingots require an excess of rolling to expel cinder from\r\nthe interior of the mass, since none can exist in the ingot, which is\r\npure and perfectly homogeneous throughout, and hence requires only as\r\nmuch rolling as is necessary for the development of fibre; it therefore\r\nfollows that, instead of forming a merchant bar, or rail, by the union\r\nof a number of separate pieces welded together, it will be far more\r\nsimple and less expensive to make several bars or rails from a single\r\ningot. Doubtless this would have been done long ago had not the whole\r\nprocess been limited by the size of the ball which the puddler could\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n“The facility which the new process affords of making large masses will\r\nenable the manufacturer to produce bars that, in the old mode of\r\nworking, it was impossible to obtain; while at the same time it admits\r\nof the use of more powerful machinery, whereby a great deal of labour\r\nwill be saved and the process be greatly expedited.... I wish to call\r\nthe attention of the meeting to some of the peculiarities which\r\ndistinguish cast steel from all other forms of iron, viz., the perfectly\r\nhomogeneous character of the metal, the entire absence of sand-cracks or\r\nflaws, and its greater cohesive force and elasticity, as compared with\r\nthe blister steel from which it is made,—qualities which it derives\r\nsolely from its fusion and formation into ingots, all of which\r\nproperties malleable iron acquires in like manner by its fusion and\r\nformation into ingots in the new process; nor must it be forgotten that\r\nno amount of rolling will give the blister steel, although formed of\r\nrolled bars, the same homogeneous character that cast steel acquires by\r\na mere extension of the ingot to some ten or twelve times its original\r\nlength....\r\n\r\n“I beg to call your attention to an important fact connected with the\r\nnew process which affords peculiar facilities for the manufacture of\r\ncast steel. At that stage of the process immediately following the boil\r\nthe whole of the crude iron has passed into the condition of cast steel\r\nof ordinary quality. By the continuation of the process the steel so\r\nproduced gradually loses its small remaining portion of carbon, and\r\npasses successively from hard to soft steel, and from soft steel to\r\nsteely iron, and eventually to very soft iron; hence, at a certain\r\nperiod of the process, any quality of metal may be obtained. There is\r\none in particular which by way of distinction I call semi-steel, being\r\nin hardness about midway between ordinary cast steel and soft malleable\r\niron. This metal possesses the advantage of much greater tensile\r\nstrength than soft iron; it is also more elastic, and does not readily\r\ntake a permanent set, while it is much harder and is not worn or\r\nindented so easily as soft iron; at the same time it is not so brittle\r\nor hard to work as ordinary cast steel. These qualities render it\r\neminently well adapted to purposes where lightness and strength are\r\nspecially required, or where there is much wear, as in the case of\r\nrailway bars, which from their softness and lamellar texture soon become\r\ndestroyed. The cost of semi-steel will be a fraction less than iron,\r\nbecause the loss of metal that takes place by oxidation in the\r\nconverting vessel is about 2½ per cent. less than it is with iron; but\r\nas it is a little more difficult to roll, its cost per ton may fairly be\r\nconsidered to be the same as iron; but as its tensile strength is some\r\n30 or 40 per cent. greater than bar iron, it follows that for most\r\npurposes a much less weight of metal may be used than that so taken. The\r\nsemi-steel will form a much cheaper metal than any we are at present\r\nacquainted with. These facts have not been elicited from mere laboratory\r\nexperiments, but have been the result of working on a scale nearly twice\r\nas great as is pursued in our largest iron works, the experimental\r\napparatus doing 7 cwt. in thirty minutes, while the ordinary puddling\r\nfurnace makes only 4½ cwt. in two hours, which is made into six separate\r\nballs, while the ingots or blooms are smooth, even prisms, 10 in. square\r\nby 30 in. in length, weighing about equal to ten ordinary puddle balls.”\r\n\r\nThe startling novelty of the methods and results described in this paper\r\nhad the effect of paralyzing discussion at the time. But soon the voice\r\nof detraction was heard; many iron-masters ridiculed the idea of\r\nproducing iron and steel without fuel, and indeed it may have been\r\nobserved, the title of the paper notwithstanding, that first the silicon\r\nand carbon, and then the iron itself, really supplied the fuel. And we\r\nmust remember that malleable iron in a molten state was then deemed an\r\nimpossibility, for the hottest furnaces then known could not effect the\r\nfusion, however prolonged their action might be, yet Bessemer was to\r\nobtain five tons in this condition in the short space of half an hour\r\nwith no other aid than cold air. Then it was said that Bessemer’s\r\nprocess of forcing air into melted cast iron had no claim of novelty,\r\nfor it had been tried before and found valueless. Some iron-masters on\r\ntrying experiments on a small scale and with imperfect appliances met\r\nwith failures, and discredited the process at once; but five large\r\nestablishments paid for licences sums amounting to £26,500 within three\r\nweeks of the reading of the paper. At the works of the Dowlais Iron Co.,\r\nin South Wales, who were the first licensees, the first converter was\r\nset up under Bessemer’s personal superintendence, and at the first\r\noperation five tons of iron were produced direct from the blast furnace\r\npig. This apparently satisfactory result proved quite otherwise when\r\nthis iron came to be practically tested; for it was found quite useless!\r\nIt was both “_cold-short_” and “red-short,” to use the technical\r\nterms,—the former of which means that although the sample may be welded,\r\nit is when cold brittle and rotten; the latter means that at a low red\r\nheat it breaks and crumbles under the hammer. Further trials were made,\r\nnew experiments instituted, but the success that attended Bessemer’s\r\nearly experiments could not be repeated, and as yet no one knew the\r\nreason why. Now it so happened that in the preliminary experiments an\r\nexceptionally pure pig iron had been made use of containing little or no\r\nphosphorus or sulphur, substances very deleterious in iron, and still\r\nmore so in steel. With the capital obtained by the sale of his licences\r\nBessemer quietly set to work to investigate the cause of his\r\nnon-success, making daily experiments with a ton or two of metal at a\r\ntime. These experiments extended over a period of two and a half years,\r\nand upon them Bessemer and his partner spent about £16,000, besides the\r\n£4,000 the preliminary researches had cost. But all difficulties were at\r\nlength overcome, and the process was now found capable of turning out\r\npure iron and steel when the pure pig iron of Sweden was used in the\r\nconverter. In the meantime the licensees had made no attempts\r\npractically to carry out the process, which began to be denounced as\r\nvisionary: it was “a mare’s nest”; it was “a meteor that had passed\r\nthrough the metallurgical world, but had gone out with all its sparks.”\r\nWhen Bessemer again brought the subject before the public, he found that\r\nno one believed in it; everyone said, “Oh, this is the thing that made\r\nsuch a blaze two or three years ago, and which was a failure.” Neither\r\niron-makers nor steel-makers would now take it up. Bessemer and his\r\npartner thereupon joined with three other gentlemen to establish at\r\nSheffield a steel-works of their own, where the invention should be\r\ncarried into full practice. In due time works were erected, and they\r\ncommenced to sell steel, receiving at first very paltry orders, for such\r\nquantities as 28 lbs. or 56 lbs.; but the orders soon became larger, and\r\nafterwards very much larger, for they were underselling the Sheffield\r\nmanufacturers by £20 a ton, and their steel was undistinguishable from\r\nthe higher priced article. Bessemer had now bought his licences back\r\nagain, and in the course of his second set of experiments had patented\r\neach improvement as it occurred to him, finally bringing the mechanical\r\napparatus to the degree of efficiency requisite for practical working,\r\nwithout which his primary idea would have been valueless. Before\r\ndirecting the reader’s attention to the form the apparatus had assumed,\r\nwe may transcribe what Mr. Jeans, in the work above referred to, has\r\ntold about the commercial success of the Bessemer steel-making firm:—\r\n\r\n“On the expiration of the fourteen years’ term of partnership of this\r\nfirm the works, which had been greatly increased from time to time out\r\nof revenues, were sold by private contract for exactly twenty-four times\r\nthe amount of the whole subscribed capital, notwithstanding that the\r\nfirm had divided in profits during the partnership a sum equal to\r\nfifty-seven times the gross capital, so that by the mere commercial\r\nworking of the process, apart from the patent, each of the five partners\r\nretired after fourteen years from the Sheffield works with eighty-one\r\ntimes the amount of his subscribed capital, or an average of nearly\r\ncent. per cent., every two months,—a result probably unprecedented in\r\nthe annals of commerce.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 24.—_Bessemer Converter._\r\n\r\n  A, Front view, showing the mouth, _c_; B, Section.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe form of the Bessemer apparatus as it finally left the inventor’s\r\nhands may now be considered: but in certain details and arrangements\r\nsome modifications, dictated by the experience and requirements of\r\nindividual establishments, have been made, leaving the principles of the\r\napparatus unchanged. Thus instead of making the converting vessel turn\r\non trunnions, it is sometimes constructed fixed, the fluid metal after\r\nconversion being let out at a tap-hole; the number and size of the\r\n_tuyères_ are varied; and so with the disposition of the air chamber or\r\n_tuyère_ box, the pressure of the blast, the capacity of the converter\r\nitself, etc. In capacity converters vary between 2½ tons and 10 tons;\r\none of medium size is shown in elevation and section in Fig. 24, and may\r\nbe described as an egg-shaped vessel about 15 ft. high and 6 ft.\r\ndiameter inside. It is strongly made of wrought iron in two parts bolted\r\ntogether, and is lined inside with some thick infusible coating, of\r\nwhich more is to be said presently. The converter swings on trunnions,\r\none of which is hollow, and admits the blast by the pipe _b_ to the base\r\nof the vessel, whence it passes through the passages shown at _e_. The\r\nthickness of the lining at _e_ may perhaps be 20 in., and passages for\r\nthe air are perforated in fire-clay _tuyères_, of which there may be\r\nseven, each with seven perforations of half an inch diameter. To the\r\nother trunnion is attached a toothed wheel which engages the teeth of a\r\nrack receiving motion from hydraulic pressure. The iron for the\r\noperation is melted in a furnace having its hearth above the level of\r\nthe converter; and to receive its charge the latter is turned so that\r\nthe molten cast iron may be poured in from a trough until its surface is\r\nnearly on a level with the lowest of the _tuyères_. The blast having\r\nbeen turned on, the hydraulic power is set to work and the converter is\r\nslowly brought to an upright position. The pressure of the current of\r\nair prevents any of the fluid metal from entering the blow-holes. The\r\nblast of cold air is continued until all the silicon and carbon have\r\nbeen removed by oxidation. If the production is to be steel, there is\r\nthen added to the contents of the converter, placed in position to\r\nreceive it, a certain weight of melted cast iron of a special\r\nconstitution, and the blow is resumed for a few minutes; or in more\r\nrecent practice this special metal is added to the fluid metal run out\r\nof the converter into a spacious ladle in known quantity. On this\r\naddition an intense action takes place, attended by an extremely\r\nbrilliant flame and a throwing out of cinder or slag. The metal thus\r\nadded to the decarbonized iron is a carbonized alloy of iron and\r\nmanganese obtained from an ore naturally containing the latter metal,\r\nand scarcely any phosphorus or sulphur. The charcoal pig from this ore\r\nis called _spiegeleisen_ (German = mirror-iron) from its brilliant\r\nreflecting facets; it contains from 12 to 20 per cent. of manganese,\r\nwith about 5 per cent. of carbon, and a considerable proportion of\r\nsilicon. An exact chemical analysis of the particular spiegeleisen\r\nhaving been previously made, it is known what proportion of it is to be\r\nadded to the decarbonized iron in order to convert this into a steel\r\nwith any required content of carbon. The manganese probably acts by\r\ncombining with oxide of iron diffused through the mass, and together\r\nwith the silicon forming the very easily separated slag which is\r\nejected.\r\n\r\nThe whole series of operations connected with the Bessemer process may\r\nbe easily followed by the help of Fig. 25, which is taken from a\r\nbeautiful model in the Museum of Practical Geology. This model, which\r\nwas presented to the museum by Mr. Bessemer himself, represents every\r\npart of the machinery and appliances of the true relative sizes. C is\r\nthe trough, lined with infusible clay, by which the liquid pig iron is\r\nconveyed to the converters, A. The hydraulic apparatus by which the\r\nvessels are turned over is here below the pavement, but the rack which\r\nturns the pinion on the axis of the converter is shown at B. The vessel\r\ninto which the molten steel is poured from the converter is marked E,\r\nand this vessel is swung round on a crane, D, so as to bring it exactly\r\nover the moulds, placed in a circle ready to receive the liquid steel,\r\nwhich on cooling is turned out in the form of solid ingots. The valves\r\nwhich control the blast, and those which regulate the movements of the\r\nconverter through the hydraulic apparatus, are worked by the handle seen\r\nat H. The crane, or revolving table, D, is also under perfect control,\r\nso that the crude pig iron is converted into steel, and the moulds are\r\nfilled with a rapidity and ease that are positively marvellous to a\r\nspectator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 25.—_Model of Bessemer Steel Apparatus._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe development of the Bessemer process soon had the effect of so\r\nreducing the price of steel that this material came into use for almost\r\nevery purpose for which iron had previously been employed, such as\r\nrailway bars, girders, etc., for bridges, boiler plates, etc., for all\r\nwhich “steely iron” containing only 0·12 to 0·40 per cent. carbon proved\r\nadmirably adapted. The practical success of the Bessemer process had not\r\nlong been demonstrated commercially by the inventor and his partners at\r\nSheffield before other firms began the manufacture: so that in 1878\r\nthere were in Great Britain alone twenty-seven establishments making\r\nBessemer steel and using 111 converters. It may give an idea of the\r\nmagnitude the Bessemer steel manufacture had attained even at that time\r\nif we quote the cost of erecting a complete plant for two 5–ton\r\nconverters: it was £44,400, as given in a detailed estimate. In all\r\nthese cases pig iron from ores free from phosphorus and sulphur had to\r\nbe used, for as we have seen the converter failed to eliminate these\r\nvitiating elements. Imported pig ores had in general to be used, or pig\r\nfrom the limited supply of British hæmatite ores in West Cumberland. The\r\nBarrow Hæmatite Steel Company engaged in the production of Bessemer\r\nsteel on a very large scale, having by 1878 erected no fewer than\r\nsixteen converters of the capacity of 6 tons each. In the meanwhile many\r\nefforts were made to discover some method of eliminating phosphorus, so\r\nthat the ordinary qualities of British pig iron, and iron derived in any\r\npart of the world from the coarse phosphorized ores, might be available\r\nfor the converter. Many of the methods then devised proved correct in\r\nprinciple and feasible in practice; but as, for sundry reasons, none of\r\nthem came extensively into use, we need not here allude to them further.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the problem was announced in 1879. Some years before, G.\r\nJ. Snelus had come to the conclusion that with a siliceous lining it\r\nwould be impossible to eliminate phosphorus in the Bessemer converter,\r\nand that some refractory substance of a basic character must be sought\r\nfor in order that the slag produced should be in a condition to absorb\r\nthe phosphoric acid as fast as it is produced. He patented in 1872 the\r\nuse of magnesian limestone as a material for the lining; as that\r\nsubstance when intensely heated became very hard and stony, being in\r\nthat condition quite unaffected by water. Two young chemists, Messrs.\r\nThomas and Gilchrist, apparently without being aware of Mr. Snelus’s\r\nconclusions, had also convinced themselves that the chief deficiency in\r\nthe Bessemer process was due to the excess of silica in the slag, and in\r\n1874 they began to try the effect of basic linings, and also of basic\r\nadditions, such as lime, etc., to the charge in the converter, so that\r\nthe lining itself should not be worn out by entering into the slag.\r\nTheir results proved that phosphorus could be eliminated when the slag\r\ncontained excess of a strong base. An example of an operation at\r\nBolckow, Vaughan, & Company’s Eston works with the highly phosphorized\r\nCleveland pig iron may be quoted. The basic-lined converter received\r\nfirst 9 cwt. of lime, then 6 tons of metal. When the blast at 25 lbs.\r\npressure was turned on, the silicon began at once to burn; for three\r\nminutes the carbon was not affected, but for fourteen minutes longer it\r\nregularly diminished, the silicon keeping pace with it. After the blow\r\nhad been continued for thirteen minutes from the commencement, the\r\nconverter was turned down to allow of the further introduction of 19½\r\ncwt. of a mixture of two parts of lime with one of oxide of iron. So\r\nlong as 1·5 per cent. of carbon remained in the metal the phosphorus was\r\nuntouched, and at the end of the blow, _i.e._ when the flame dropped,\r\nonly one-third of it had been eliminated; it still formed 1 per cent. of\r\nthe metal. The blast continued for another two minutes brought it down\r\nto ¼ per cent., and in one more minute only a trace was left. Most of\r\nthe sulphur was got rid of at the same time. From Cleveland pig, thus\r\nde-phosphorized in the Bessemer converter, large quantities of steel\r\nrails were rolled for the North Eastern Railway Company, and were found\r\nentirely satisfactory, being as good as those made from the Cumberland\r\nhæmatite steel. This de-phosphorized process has been brought into\r\noperation wherever phosphoric ores are dealt with, and it has been\r\napplied with equal success in the “open hearth” furnaces, of which we\r\nhave now to speak.\r\n\r\nAll discoveries and all inventions may be traced back to preceding\r\ndiscoveries and inventions in an endless series, and it is only by its\r\nprecursors that each in its turn has been made possible. If we take one\r\nof the greatest marvels brought into existence at nearly the close of\r\nour epoch, namely, “wireless telegraphy,” we may follow up links of a\r\nchain connecting it with the recorded observations of an ancient Greek\r\n(Thales) who flourished seven centuries before our era, and even these\r\nmay not have been original discoveries of his. And it will have been\r\ngathered from what has already been said that steel must have been\r\nproduced, however unwittingly, at the earliest period at which man began\r\nto reduce iron from its ores. So the very latest, and for many purposes\r\nthe most extensively practised, process of modern steel-making, brought\r\nindeed to working perfection mainly by the perseverance and scientific\r\ninsight of two individuals, is the result of the observation and the\r\naccumulated experience of former generations. The observations and\r\nexperience here alluded to are chiefly those that follow two lines: one\r\nconcerning the properties of the metal itself, the other relating to the\r\nmeans of commanding very high temperatures on a great scale. On this\r\noccasion we are able almost to lay a finger on some proximate links of\r\nthe chain. Réaumur, the French naturalist, made steel in the early part\r\nof the eighteenth century by melting cast iron in a crucible, and in\r\nthis liquid metal he dissolved wrought iron, the product being, as the\r\nreader will now easily understand, the intermediate substance, steel;\r\nand this was obtained of course at a temperature which was incapable of\r\nfusing wrought iron by itself. He published in 1722 a treatise on “The\r\nArt of converting Iron into Steel, and of softening Cast Iron.” For\r\nthis, and certain other metallurgical discoveries, Réaumur received a\r\nlife-pension equivalent to about £500 per annum,—a treatment very\r\ndifferent from that dealt out by the British to Henry Cort. The action\r\nin Réaumur’s crucible is precisely that used on the large scale in\r\nSiemens’ open hearth. But this last became possible only when Siemens\r\nhad worked out his “regenerative stove” or heat accumulator, the\r\ndevelopment of an idea suggested by a Dundee clergyman in 1817.\r\n\r\nA general notion of the Siemens’ regenerative stove will have been\r\nalready gained from the account given before of its application to the\r\nmodern type of blast furnace. Of the inventor himself, C. William\r\nSiemens, it may be observed that he was one of a family of brothers, all\r\nremarkable for their scientific attainments, and in many of his\r\nresearches and processes he was aided by his brothers Frederick and\r\nOtto. In our article on “Electric Power and Lighting” there will be\r\nfound some notice of a few of Siemens’ inventions pertaining to those\r\nsubjects. A still more admirable invention of his is the electric\r\npyrometer, an instrument of the utmost utility for measuring, with an\r\naccuracy previously unapproachable, the high temperature of furnaces,\r\netc. Indeed there are few departments of science, pure or applied, which\r\nhave not been enriched by the researches and contrivances of this\r\ndistinguished man, whose merits were acknowledged by the bestowal upon\r\nhim of the highest scientific and academical honours, and also of a\r\ntitle, for he became Sir William Siemens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26.—_Section of Regenerative Stoves and Open Hearth._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSiemens was much engaged from 1846 in conjunction with his brother\r\nFrederick in experimental attempts, continued over a period of ten\r\nyears, at the construction of the regenerative gas furnace. At length,\r\nin 1861, he proposed the application of his furnace to an “open hearth,”\r\nand during the next few years some partial attempts to carry out his\r\nprocess were made, and he himself had established experimental works at\r\nBirmingham in order to mature his processes, while Messrs. Martin of\r\nSireuil, in France, having obtained licences under Siemens’ patents,\r\ngave their attention to a modification of his process, by which they\r\nsucceeded in producing excellent steel. Siemens having in 1868 proved\r\nthe practicability of his plans by converting at his Birmingham works\r\nsome old phosphorized iron rails into serviceable steel, a company was\r\nformed, and in 1869 the Landore Siemens’ Steel Works were established at\r\nLandore in Glamorganshire, and a few years after, these had sixteen\r\nSiemens open hearth melting furnaces at work, giving a total output of\r\n1,200 tons of steel per week. The number of furnaces was subsequently\r\nincreased. Extensive works specially designed for carrying out the\r\nSiemens and the Siemens-Martin process were shortly afterwards erected\r\nat other places, as at Newtown, near Glasgow, Panteg in Wales, etc. In\r\nGreat Britain the open hearth process gradually gained upon the\r\nBessemer, until in 1893, when the total output of both kinds amounted to\r\nnearly 3,000,000 tons, this was almost equally divided between them, and\r\nsince that period the steel made by the former has greatly surpassed in\r\namount that made by the latter.\r\n\r\nHow the regenerative stove, or heat accumulator, works, and how it is\r\napplied in the open hearth process, the reader may learn by aid of the\r\ndiagram Fig. 26, in which however no representation of the disposition\r\nof the parts in any actual furnace is given, nor any details of\r\nconstruction beyond what is necessary to make the principle clear. On\r\nthe right and on the left of the diagram will be seen a pair of similar\r\nchambers which are shown as partly below the level of the ground S S´,\r\nsuch being a usual disposition. The outer walls of these chambers are\r\nthick and the interior is entirely lined with the most refractory\r\nfire-bricks, of which also is formed the partition in between each pair\r\nof compartments, as well as the passages from the top of each opening on\r\nthe furnace H. Each chamber or compartment is filled with rows of\r\nfire-bricks, laid chequerwise so as to leave a multitude of channels\r\nbetween. At the bottom of the chamber on the left let us suppose\r\natmospheric air to be admitted by the channels A, A, A, and a\r\ncombustible gas which we may take to be a mixture of carbonic oxide with\r\nsome hydrogen is admitted in the same way to the second compartment on\r\nthe left through the passages G, G, G. Supposing the apparatus quite\r\ncold in the first instance, the gas would ascend into the furnace H as\r\nshown by the arrows, because it might be drawn by an up-draught in a\r\nchimney connected with the six chambers shown at the bottom of the\r\nright, and it would also tend to rise up into the space H by its lighter\r\nspecific gravity, and there it could be set on fire, when a volume of\r\nflame would pass across to the right, a plentiful supply of air rushing\r\nin through the air chamber from A, A, A, and the products of the\r\ncombustion, mainly hot carbonic acid gas and hot nitrogen gas, in\r\npassing through the right-hand chambers, would make the bricks in both\r\ncompartments very hot after a time, for the current would divide itself\r\nbetween the two passages, as indicated by the divided arrow. We have not\r\nshown the valves by which the workman is able, by merely pulling a\r\nlever, to shut off the air supply from A, A, A, and of gas from G, G, G,\r\nand put these channels into direct communication with the up-draught\r\nchimney, at the same time supplying gas at G´, G´, G´, and air at A´,\r\nA´, A´. These rise up among the now heated bricks each in its own\r\ncompartment, but mix where they enter the furnace H, now hot enough to\r\nset them on fire, and the gaseous products of combustion, hotter now\r\nthan before, descend among the fire-bricks of the left-hand\r\ncompartments, heating them in turn. After another period, say half an\r\nhour, the valves are again reversed, and again gas and air both heated\r\nburn in the space H, and their products supply still more heat to the\r\nright-hand compartments. And so the action may be continued with a great\r\ntemperature each time produced by the combustion of the combining bodies\r\nat increasingly higher temperatures. Thus, if cold gas and air by\r\ncombination give rise to 500° of heat, when the same combine, at say the\r\ninitial temperature of 400°, the result would be a temperature of 900°;\r\nif burnt at this latter degree, then 900° + 500° would be reached, and\r\nso on. It would seem as if there were no limit to the temperatures\r\nobtainable in this way. But the nature of the materials of which the\r\nfurnace is constructed imposes a limit, for even the most refractory\r\nmatters yield at length, and the working would come to an end by the\r\nfusing of the brickwork. The diagram is a section through the length of\r\nthe hearth (for it is usually oblong in plan), and the low arch above H\r\nbeing exposed to the fiercest heat, is formed of the most refractory\r\n“silica bricks,” that is, bricks made of coarsely ground silica held\r\ntogether with a little lime; yet this extremely resisting material is\r\nacted upon, and the arch has to be renewed every few months or sometimes\r\nweeks. The hearth itself is supported by massive iron plates, shown in\r\nthe diagram by the thick lines, above which is laid a deep bed L, of\r\nquartz sand or ganister, or where required a _basic_ lining, beaten hard\r\ndown, and forming a kind of basin with sides sloping down in all\r\ndirections to a point immediately below the centre of the fire-brick\r\ndoor D, where is the aperture for tapping, stopped by a mixture of sand\r\nand clay until the metal is ready for drawing off, when it runs outside\r\ninto an iron spout lined with sand and is received into the ingot\r\nmoulds. B in the figure represents the “bath,” as it is called, of\r\nmolten metal, which, in the larger furnaces, where 20 tons of metal is\r\noperated on at once, may occupy an area of 150 square ft.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be mentioned that there has to be a certain adjustment\r\nbetween the volumes of air and of gas that pass into the regenerative\r\nstoves, in order that the best effect may be obtained. Besides the limit\r\nof temperature occasioned by the nature of the materials, there is a\r\nchemical reason why the regenerative stoves cannot increase the\r\ntemperature indefinitely. It is noticed that when the temperature of the\r\nfurnace has become very high indeed, the flame over the hearth assumes a\r\npeculiar appearance, being interrupted by dark spaces. These are\r\nattributable to what is called in chemistry “dissociation,”—in this case\r\nthe dissociation of carbonic acid gas, which by the heat alone separates\r\ninto carbonic oxide and oxygen gases. In the same way these gases refuse\r\nto combine if brought together heated beyond a certain temperature. This\r\nphenomenon of dissociation is a general one, for it is found that for\r\nany pair of substances there is a characteristic range of temperature\r\nabove or below which they refuse to combine. The gas used in these\r\nstoves is either unpurified coal gas, or that produced by passing steam\r\nover red-hot coal or coke.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the Siemens and the Siemens-Martin open hearth\r\nprocesses. In the latter a charge of pig iron, say 1½ tons, is first\r\nmelted on the hearth, then about 2 tons of wrought iron is added in\r\nsuccessive portions, and in like manner nearly as much scrap steel\r\n(_i.e._ turnings, etc.), the final addition being half a ton of\r\nspiegeleisen containing 12 per cent. of manganese. A furnace of\r\ncorresponding dimensions will allow of three charges every twenty-four\r\nhours. In the Siemens process it is not wrought iron or steel scrap that\r\nis mainly used to decarbonize the pig, but a pure oxide ore. This is\r\nthrown into the bath of molten metal in quantities of a few cwts. at a\r\ntime, when a violent ebullition occurs. When samples of the metal and of\r\nthe slag are found to be satisfactory, spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese\r\nis added, and the charge is cast. This process takes a rather longer\r\ntime than the former, but gives steel of more uniform character. In both\r\nprocesses, phosphorus is oxidized at the high temperature attained and\r\npasses into the slag, which last floats of course on the molten metal\r\nand is from time to time tapped off as the action proceeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26_a_.—_Rolling Mill._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 26_a_ shows a rolling mill with what is called a “two-high” train\r\nfor finishing bars by passing them between the grooves cut in the rolls\r\nto give the required section. The rolls in the illustration turn in one\r\ndirection only, and therefore the bars after emerging from the larger\r\ngrooves have to be drawn back over the machine and set into a smaller\r\npair from the same side. This inconvenience is avoided in the\r\n“three-high train,” on which three rolls revolve, and the bars can be\r\npassed through them from one side to the other alternately. The celerity\r\nwith which a glowing steel ingot is without re-heating converted into a\r\nstraight steel rail 60 or 100 feet long, by passing a few times\r\nbackwards and forwards between the rolls, is very striking. These rolls\r\nare made of solid steel, and in some cases have a diameter of 26 inches\r\nor more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _IRON IN ARCHITECTURE._\r\n\r\nEveryone knows how much iron is used in those great engineering\r\nstructures that mark the present age, and of which a few examples will\r\nbe described in succeeding articles. One other feature of the nineteenth\r\ncentury is the use of iron in architecture. Some have, indeed, protested\r\nagainst the use of iron for this purpose, and would even deny the name\r\nof architecture to any structure obviously or chiefly formed of that\r\nmaterial. Stone and wood, they say, are the only proper materials,\r\nbecause each part must be wrought by hand, and cannot be cast or\r\nmoulded; and further, iron being liable to rust, suggests decay and want\r\nof permanence, and these are characters incompatible with noble\r\nbuilding. All this can rest only on a relative degree of truth—as, for\r\ninstance, machinery is used to dress and shape both wood and stone, and\r\nthe permanence of even the latter is as much dependent on conditions as\r\nthat of iron. Iron used in architecture is hideous when applied in\r\nshapes appropriate only to stone; but when it is disposed in the way\r\nsuggested by its own properties, and receives ornament suitable to its\r\nown nature, the result is harmonious and graceful, and the structure may\r\ndisplay beauties that could be attained by no other materials. Be that\r\nas it may, the great and lofty covered spaces that are required for our\r\nrailway stations and for other purposes could have been obtained only by\r\nthe free use of iron, and everyone can recall to mind instances of such\r\nstructure not devoid of elegance, in spite of the absence—the proper\r\nabsence—of the Classic “orders” or Gothic “styles.” The first notable\r\ninstance of the application of iron on a large scale was the erection of\r\nthe “Crystal Palace,” in Hyde Park, for the great Exhibition of 1851. It\r\nwas taken down and re-erected at Sydenham, and there it has become so\r\nwell known to everyone that any description of it is quite unnecessary\r\nin this place.\r\n\r\nAs another conspicuous example of what may be done with iron, the Eiffel\r\nTower at Paris may be briefly described.\r\n\r\nThe idea of erecting a tower 1,000 feet high was not of itself new. It\r\nhad been entertained in England as early as 1833, in America in 1874,\r\nand in Paris itself in 1881. It has been reserved for M. Gustave Eiffel,\r\na native of Dijon, who commenced to practise as an engineer in 1855, to\r\nrealize this ambitious project. He has long been occupied in the\r\nconstruction of great railway bridges and viaducts, and in these he has\r\nadopted a system peculiar to himself of braced wrought-iron piers\r\nwithout masonry or cast-iron columns. He also was the first French\r\nengineer to erect bridges of great span without scaffolding. In the\r\nGarabit viaduct he planned an arch of 541 feet, crossing the Truyère at\r\na height of nearly 400 feet above it. One result of M. Eiffel’s studies\r\nin connection with these lofty piers was his proposal to erect the tower\r\nfor the Paris Exhibition of 1889. This proposal met with great\r\nopposition on the part of many influential people in Paris—authors,\r\npainters, architects, and others protesting with great energy against\r\nthe modern Tower of Babel, which was, as they said, to disfigure and\r\nprofane the noble stone buildings of Paris by the monstrosities of a\r\nmachine maker, etc. etc. The Eiffel Tower is now constructed, and no one\r\nhas heard that it has dishonoured the monuments of Paris, for it has\r\nbeen instead a triumph of French skill, the glory of its designer, and\r\nthe wonder of the Exhibition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26_b_.—_The Eiffel Tower in course of construction._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe tower rests on four independent foundations, each at the angle of a\r\nsquare of about 330 feet in the side, and it may be noted that the two\r\nfoundations near the Seine had to be differently treated from the other\r\ntwo, where a bed of gravel 18 feet thick was found at 23 feet below the\r\nsurface, and where a bed of concrete, 7 feet thick, gave a good\r\nfoundation. The foundations next the river had to be sunk 50 feet below\r\nthe surface to obtain perfectly good foundations. Underlying the whole\r\nis a deep stratum of clay; but this is separated from the foundations by\r\na layer of gravel of sufficient thickness. Above this are beds of\r\nconcrete, covering an area of 60 square metres, and on the concrete\r\nrests a pile of masonry. Each of the four piles is bound together by two\r\ngreat iron bars, 25 feet long and 4 inches diameter, uniting the masonry\r\nby means of iron cramps, and anchoring the support of the structure,\r\nalthough its stability is already secured by its mere weight. The tower\r\nis of curved pyramidal form, so designed that it shall be capable of\r\nresisting wind pressure, without requiring the four corner structures to\r\nbe connected by diagonal bracing. The four curved supports are, in fact,\r\nconnected with each other only by girders at the platforms on the\r\nseveral stages, until at a considerable length they are sufficiently\r\nnear to each other to admit the use of the ordinary diagonals. The work\r\nwas begun at the end of January, 1887, and M. Eiffel notes how the\r\nimagination of the workmen was impressed by the notion of the vast\r\nheight of the intended structure. Not steel, but iron is the material\r\nused throughout, and the weight of it is about 7,300 tons, without\r\nreckoning what is used in the foundations, and in the machinery\r\nconnected with the lifts, etc. It has long ago been found that stone\r\nwould be an unsuitable material for a structure of this kind, and it is\r\nobvious that only iron could possibly have been used to build a tower of\r\nso vast a height and within so short a space of time, for it was\r\ncompleted in April, 1889. A comparison of heights with the loftiest\r\nstone edifices may not be without interest. The highest building in\r\nParis is the dome of the Invalides, 344 feet; Strasburg Cathedral rises\r\nto 466 feet; the Great Pyramid to 479 feet; the apex of the spire in the\r\nrecently completed Cathedral at Cologne to 522 feet. These are\r\novertopped by the lofty stone obelisk the Americans have erected at\r\nWashington, which attains a height of more than 550 feet. Such spires\r\nand towers have been erected only at the cost of immense labour. But\r\niron, which can be so readily joined by riveting, lends itself\r\ninvitingly to the skill of the constructor, more particularly by reason\r\nof the wonderful tensile strength it possesses. It is scarcely possible\r\nto convey any adequate idea of the great complicated network of bracings\r\nby which in the Eiffel Tower each standard of the columns is united to\r\nthe rest to form one rigid pile. The horizontal girders unite the four\r\npiers in forming the supports of the first storey some 170 feet above\r\nthe base. The arches which spring from the ground and rise nearly to the\r\nlevel of these girders are not so much intended to add to the strength\r\nof the structure as to increase its architectural effect. The first\r\nstorey stands about 180 feet above the ground, and is provided with\r\narcades, from which fine views of Paris may be obtained. Here there are\r\nspacious restaurants of four different nationalities. And in the centre\r\nof the second storey (380 feet high) is a station where passengers\r\nchange from the inclined lifts to enter other elevators that ascend\r\nvertically to the higher stages of the tower. On the third storey, 900\r\nfeet above the ground, there is a saloon more than 50 feet square,\r\ncompletely shut in by glass, whence a vast panorama may be contemplated.\r\nAbove this again are laboratories and scientific observatories, and,\r\ncrowning all, is the lighthouse, provided with a system of optical\r\napparatus for projecting the rays from a powerful electric light. This\r\nlight has been seen from the Cathedral at Orléans, a distance of about\r\n70 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26_c_.—_The Eiffel Tower._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe buildings of the Paris Exhibition of 1889 are themselves splendid\r\nexamples, not only of engineering skill, but of good taste and elegant\r\ndesign in iron structures and their decorations. The vast _Salle des\r\nMachines_ (machinery hall) exceeds in dimensions anything of the kind in\r\nexistence, for it is nearly a quarter of a mile long, and its roof\r\ncovers at one span its width of 380 feet, rising to a height of 150 feet\r\nin the centre. This great hall is to remain permanently, as well as the\r\nother principal galleries with their graceful domes.\r\n\r\nThe Eiffel Tower having proved one of the most striking features of the\r\ngreat Paris Exhibition, and of itself a novelty sufficient to attract\r\nvisitors to the spot, and having, long before the Exhibition closed,\r\ncompletely defrayed the expense of its construction, with a handsome\r\nprofit besides, its success has naturally provoked similar\r\nenterprises,—as, for instance, at Blackpool, a seaside resort in\r\nLancashire, there has been erected an openwork metal tower, resembling\r\nthe Paris structure, but of far less altitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Tall Buildings in American Cities._\r\n\r\nIn several of the great cities of the United States, the last few years\r\nhave witnessed a novel and characteristic development of the use of iron\r\nin architecture. In many structures on the older continent, this\r\nmaterial has been frankly and effectively employed, forming the obvious\r\nframework of the erection, even when the leading motive was quite other\r\nthan a display of engineering skill. The Crystal Palace at Sydenham and\r\nother erections have been referred to, in which iron has taken its place\r\nas the main component of structures designed more or less to fulfil\r\næsthetic requirements: the guiding principle in “tall office buildings”\r\nin the cities of the Western continent is, on the contrary, avowedly\r\nutilitarian. Iron has, of course, long been used in the form of pillars,\r\nbeams, etc., in ordinary buildings, and it is only the extraordinary\r\nextension of this employment of it, after the lift or elevator had been\r\nperfected, and the ground-space in great commercial centres was daily\r\nbecoming more valuable, that has led to the erection of structures of\r\nthe “sky-scraper” class in American cities. For a given plot at a stated\r\nrent, a building of many stories, let throughout as offices, will\r\nobviously bring to its owner a greater return than one of few stories.\r\nThe elevators now make a tenth story practically as accessible as a\r\nthird storey, and the tall building readily fills with tenants. No claim\r\nfor artistic beauty has been advanced for these structures, which aim\r\nsimply at being places of business, and if provision be made for\r\nsufficient floor-space and daylight, and for artificial lighting,\r\nheating, and ventilation, together with the ordinary conveniences of\r\nmodern life, and ready elevator service, nothing more is required by the\r\nutilitarian spirit, that seeks only facilities for money-getting. These\r\ntall buildings are usually erected on plots disproportionately small,\r\nand the architectural effect is apt to be bizarre and incongruous,\r\nespecially when the structure shoots up skyward in some comparatively\r\nnarrow street amid more modest surroundings. They are really engineering\r\nstructures, but invested with features belonging to edifices of quite\r\nanother order of construction. If they are necessities of the place and\r\nperiod, and are “come to stay,” it cannot be doubted but that decoration\r\nof an appropriate and harmonious character will, in course of time, be\r\nevolved along with them, when the conventionality that clings to\r\narchitecture shall be broken through, and a new style appear, as\r\nconsistent, and therefore as beautiful, in relation to the “tall office\r\nbuilding,” as were those of the Greek temple and the Gothic minster in\r\ntheir free and natural adaptation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE IV.\r\n\r\n  THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY BUILDING.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26_d_.—_St. Paul Building, N. Y._\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere, apparently, is the opportunity for the advent of a new and\r\ncharacteristic style. There is great ingenuity displayed in the\r\narrangement and internal finish of these buildings. But besides the\r\nsomewhat novel application of iron, the most notable circumstances\r\nregarding them are the tendency to make them of greater and greater\r\nheight, and the wonderfully short time in which, upon occasion, they can\r\nbe run up. Chicago has recently been noted for its tall edifices, among\r\nwhich may be named _The Reliance Building_, erected upon a site only 55\r\nfeet in breadth, but rising in fourteen stories to the height of 200\r\nfeet, and presenting the appearance of a tower. There are no cast iron\r\npillars, but the whole metal framework is of rolled steel, the columns\r\nconsisting of eight angle-sections, bolted together in two-story\r\nlengths, adjoining columns breaking joint at each floor, and braced\r\ntogether with plate girders, 24 inches deep, bolted to the face of the\r\ncolumns, with which they form a rigid connection. Externally, the\r\nedifice shows nothing but white enamelled terra-cotta and plate glass.\r\nThis building was originally a strongly-built structure of five stories,\r\nthe lower one being occupied as a bank. The foundations and the first\r\nstory were taken out, and prepared for the lofty edifice, the\r\nsuperstructure being the while supported on screws. Then the three upper\r\nstories were taken down, and the building was continued from the second\r\nstory, which was filled with tenants while the building was in course of\r\nerection above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26_e_.—_Manhattan Insurance Co.’s Building, in course of\r\n    erection._\r\n]\r\n\r\nStill more lofty edifices have been going skyward in other places.\r\nAlready in New York there are a great number of lofty piles due to the\r\nintroduction of the lifts or elevators, by which an office on the tenth\r\nfloor is made as convenient as one on the second. These buildings\r\nusually receive the name of the owners of the structure, who occupy,\r\nperhaps, only one floor. To mention only a few. There is the American\r\nTract Society building, with its twenty-three stories, 285 feet high,\r\nwhich is one of the latest and handsomest of these tall piles in the\r\ncity. See Plate IV. Still loftier is the St. Paul building, fronting the\r\nNew York Post-Office at the junction of Park Row and Broadway. This\r\nstructure is splayed at the angle between Ann Street and Broadway, where\r\nits width is 39½ feet, while its _loftiest_ part has frontages of about\r\n30 feet along each of these thoroughfares. The height is no less than\r\n313 feet above the pavement, and the number of stories is twenty-five.\r\nThis building is faced with light yellow limestone, and although it was\r\ncommenced only in the summer of 1895, it was expected to be ready for\r\noccupation by the autumn of 1896. Even this great height is overtopped\r\nby the Manhattan Life Insurance Company’s building, rising 330 feet, and\r\nremarkable as perhaps beyond previous record of quickness in building a\r\ngigantic structure. Obviously, the foundations of such a building must\r\nbe most seriously considered, prepared and tested, before the great bulk\r\nof the building is begun, and in the _New York Engineering Magazine_ one\r\nof the architects has given a full account, with complete illustrations,\r\nof all the works, from the rock foundation to the completed edifice. A\r\ndescription of the foundation work, though most interesting for the\r\nprofessional engineer, would probably have little attraction for the\r\ngeneral reader; but its importance may be inferred from the fact of its\r\nhaving taken nearly six months for its completion, while the huge\r\nsuperstructure required only eight months. The eighteenth tier of beams\r\nwas reached in “three months from the time the foundations were ready on\r\nwhich to set the first piece of steel, composing the bolsters that\r\nsupport the cantilever system.... The substructure, which starts in\r\nbed-rock and continues to the cellar-floor, consists of fifteen piers,\r\nvarying in size from 9 feet in diameter, to 21 feet 6 inches by 25 feet\r\nsquare.... The number of bricks used in the piers amounted to 1,500,000.\r\nFrom this it may be seen that a good-sized building was sunk out of\r\nsight before any part of the superstructure could be begun.” An open\r\ncourt within the main structure, special framing for the arrangements of\r\nthe company’s offices on the sixth floor, the great height and weight of\r\nthe tower, and the requisite provision for wind-bracing, delayed in some\r\ndegree a regular advance of the stories; but within three months no less\r\nthan 5,800 tons were placed in position. There were girders weighing 40\r\ntons, many columns of 10 and 12 tons, and cantilevers of 80 tons weight\r\nand 67 feet long. Strange to say, that in a building of this magnitude,\r\nwhere such masses had to be raised 300 feet into the air, there was not\r\na single accident involving loss of life. When four stories of the steel\r\nframework had been put up, the bricklayers were set to work, and they\r\nfollowed the frame-setters throughout. After the masons came the\r\npipe-layers, with their ten miles of pipes, followed by electricians,\r\nfixing their thirty-five miles of communicating wires. Thirty thousand\r\ncubic feet of stone was cut and set on the Broadway front in eighty\r\ndays. Then craftsmen of the different trades followed each other, or\r\nworked in harmony together, story after story upwards: the engineers for\r\nboilers, heating, and elevators, the plumbers, the decorators, the\r\ncarpenters and cabinet-makers, the plasterers, the marble and tile\r\nworkers, the gasmen, etc. In fine, every story was completely finished\r\nand ready for occupation in eight months after the start from the\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26_f_.—_Manhattan Insurance Co.’s Buildings nearly completed._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe shortness of the time in which these lofty buildings were run up is\r\nnot less remarkable than the completeness of their fittings, which\r\ncomprise everything requisite for communication within the premises and\r\nin connection with the outer world. The elevators or lifts are the\r\nperfection of mechanism in their way, and act with wonderful smoothness\r\nand regularity; of these are usually two at least, as well as an ample\r\nstaircase. Notwithstanding all these appliances, some disastrous and\r\nfatal conflagrations have occurred at buildings erected on the “tall”\r\nprinciple; and as “business premises” of even 380 feet high are\r\nprojected, the authorities have been considering the desirability of\r\nrestricting the heights. It has been proposed that offices should not\r\nexceed in height 200 feet; hotels, 150 feet; and private houses, 75\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _BIG WHEELS._\r\n\r\nThe Paris example of an engineering feat upon an unprecedented scale\r\nhaving proved sufficiently captivating for the general public to ensure\r\nfor itself a great commercial success, even amid the attractions of an\r\nInternational Exhibition, was not lost upon the enterprising people of\r\nthe States when the “World’s Fair” at Chicago was in preparation in\r\n1893. It was then that Mr. G. W. G. Ferris, the head of a firm of bridge\r\nconstructors at Pittsburg, conceived the idea of applying his\r\nengineering skill to the erection of a huge wheel, revolving in a\r\nvertical plane, with cars for persons to sit in, constituting, in fact,\r\nan enormous “merry-go-round,” as the machine once so common at country\r\nfairs was called. The novelty of the Chicago erection was, therefore,\r\nnot the general idea, but the magnitude of the scale, which, for that\r\nreason, involved the application of the highest engineering skill, and\r\nthe solution of hitherto unattempted practical problems. Several\r\nthousand pounds were, in fact, expended on merely preliminary plans and\r\ndesigns. The great wheel at Chicago was 250 feet in diameter, and to its\r\nperiphery were hung thirty-six carriages, each seating forty persons. At\r\neach revolution, therefore, 1,440 people would be raised in the air to\r\nthe height of 250 feet, and from that elevation afforded a splendid\r\nprospect, besides an experience of the peculiar sensation like that of\r\nbeing in a balloon, when the spectator has no perception of his own\r\nmotion, but the objects beneath appear to have the contrary movement,\r\nthat is to say, they seem to be sinking when he is rising, and _vice\r\nversâ_. The axle of the Chicago wheel was a solid cylinder, 32 inches in\r\ndiameter and 45 feet long; on this were two hubs, 16 feet in diameter,\r\nto which were attached spoke rods, 2½ inches in diameter, passing in\r\npairs to an inner crown, which was concentric with the outer rim, but 40\r\nfeet within it. The inner and outer crowns were connected together, and\r\nthe former joined to the crown of the twin wheel by an elaborate system\r\nof trusses and ties, which, however, left an open space between the rims\r\nof 20 feet from the outside. These last were formed of curved riveted\r\nhollow beams, in section 25½ inches by 19 inches, and between them,\r\nslung upon iron axles through the roofs, were suspended, at equal\r\nintervals, the thirty-six carriages, each 27 feet long, and weighing 13\r\ntons without its passengers, who added 3 tons more to the weight. The\r\nwheel with its passengers was calculated to weigh about 1,200 tons, and\r\nit rested on two pyramidal skeleton towers of ironwork 140 feet high,\r\nhaving bases 50 feet by 60 feet. The wheel was moved by power applied at\r\nthe lowest point, the peripheries of both the rims having great cogs 6\r\ninches deep and 18 inches apart, which engaged a pair of large\r\ncog-wheels, carried on a shaft 12 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26_g_.—_Original Design for the Great Wheel._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis curious structure was not begun until March, 1893, yet it was set\r\nin motion three months afterwards, having cost about £62,500. The\r\nCompany had to hand over to the Exhibition one half of the receipts\r\nafter the big wheel had paid for its construction, but even then they\r\nrealised a handsome profit, and at the close of the World’s Fair, they\r\nsold the machine for four-thirds of its cost, in order that it might be\r\nre-erected at Coney Island.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the great Ferris wheel at Chicago proved a financial\r\nsuccess than an American gentleman, Lieutenant Graydon, secured a patent\r\nfor a like machine in the United Kingdom; and as it has now become\r\nalmost a matter of course that some iron or steel structure, surpassing\r\neverything before attempted, should form a part of each great\r\nexhibition, a Company was at once formed in London, under the title of\r\n“The Gigantic Wheel and Recreation Towers Co., Limited,” to construct\r\nand work at the Earl’s Court Oriental Exhibition of 1895, a great wheel,\r\nsimilar in general form to that of Chicago. But the design of the London\r\nwheel had some new features, as will be seen from the sketches, Fig.\r\n26_c_ (from _The Engineer_ of 20th April, 1894), and, moreover, having\r\nbeen planned of larger dimensions than its American prototype, presented\r\nadditional engineering problems of no small complexity. After due\r\ndeliberation the scheme of the work was entrusted to Mr. Walter B.\r\nBasset, a talented young engineer, connected with the firm of Messrs.\r\nMaudslay, Sons, & Field, and already experienced in designing iron\r\nstructures. Under this gentleman, with the assistance of Mr. J. J.\r\nWebster in carrying out some of the details, the work has been so\r\nsuccessfully accomplished that the “Great Wheel” of 1895 may be cited as\r\none of the crowning mechanical triumphs of the nineteenth century. The\r\noriginal design has not been followed so far as regards the lower\r\nplatforms for refreshment rooms, &c. Plate V., for which we are indebted\r\nto Mr. Basset, is a photographic representation of the actual structure.\r\n\r\nThe wheel at Earl’s Court exceeds the Ferris wheel in diameter by 50\r\nfeet, being 300 feet across. It is supported on two towers, 175 feet\r\nhigh, each formed by four columns 4 feet square, built of steel plates\r\nwith internal diaphragms, and surmounted by balconies that may be\r\nascended in elevators raised by a weight of water, which, after having\r\nbeen discharged into a reservoir under the ground level, is again pumped\r\nup to the top of the towers. Between the balconies on each tower there\r\nis also a communication _through the axle_ of the wheel, which, instead\r\nof being solid as at Chicago, is a tube of 7 feet diameter, and 35 feet\r\nlong, made in sections, riveted together, of steel 1 inch thick, and\r\nweighing no less than 58 tons. The raising and fixing in its high place\r\nof such a mass of metal required specially ingenious devices, which have\r\nbeen greatly appreciated by professional engineers. But for these\r\ndevices, the erection of scaffolding in the ordinary way of proceeding\r\nwould have entailed an outlay simply enormous. The axle is stiffened by\r\nprojecting rings, and, between pairs of these, the spoke rods are\r\nattached by pins 3 inches in diameter. The axle was the production of\r\nMessrs. Maudslay, Field & Co.; all the rest of the metal work was made\r\nat the Arrol Works at Glasgow, and the carriages were constructed by\r\nBrown, Marshall & Co., of Birmingham. The Earl’s Court wheel is turned\r\nby a mechanism different from that of the Chicago wheel, for whereas the\r\nlatter was provided with cogs, the former has two chains, each 1,000\r\nfeet long and 8 tons weight, surrounding the periphery of the wheel on\r\neither side. The chains go over drums in the engine-shed, from which\r\nthey pass underground to guide-pulleys, and as they unwind from the\r\nGreat Wheel, they again go over guide-pulleys to lead them back to the\r\ndrums. These chains are firmly held throughout in the jaws of V-shaped\r\ngrooves, and there are arrangements for taking up the slack. The drums\r\nare actuated by wheel gearing, connected with two horizontal Robey steam\r\nengines, each of 50 horse-power, one on either side, capable of being\r\nworked singly or together. It is, however, found sufficient to use the\r\nengine of one side only, and even then to work it at but 16 horse-power,\r\nand the operation can be controlled by one man, who has also the command\r\nof a brake. Both starting and stopping are accomplished with the\r\ngreatest smoothness and absence of strain or jar. There are forty\r\ncarriages, each 25 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 10 feet high. Each will\r\naccommodate forty passengers, and these enter at the ends from eight\r\nplatforms at different heights from the ground, so arranged as to be on\r\nthe level of the eight lowest carriages while the wheel is stationary.\r\nThe passengers who have had their ride leave at the other end of the\r\ncarriages by eight similar platforms on the other side of the wheel.\r\nAfter the change of passengers in one set of eight carriages, the wheel\r\nis turned through exactly one-fifth of a revolution, which has the\r\neffect of bringing the next eight carriages to the level of the\r\nplatforms, and it is again brought to a standstill whilst the change of\r\npassengers is taking place; and so on, until the whole freight of say\r\n1,600 persons has been changed during the five stoppages in one\r\nrevolution, for which about thirty-five minutes are required, and the\r\nprocess of emptying and filling eight carriages at once is repeated.\r\nThere are first and second class carriages, the charge for the former\r\nbeing two shillings, and for the latter one shilling; so that, reckoning\r\n800 passengers of each class, one turn would bring to the treasury the\r\nhandsome sum of £120.\r\n\r\nThe sensations experienced in a journey on the Great Wheel are, as\r\nalready mentioned, comparable to those enjoyed by the aërial voyagers in\r\na balloon, where all perception of proper motion is lost, and it is the\r\nworld beneath that seems to recede and float away, presenting the while\r\na strangely changing panorama. Many people who have never made a balloon\r\nascent yet know the calm delight of floating in a boat without effort\r\ndown some placid stream, unconscious of any motion beyond that vaguely\r\ninferred from the silent apparent gliding by of the banks. Very similar\r\nare, in part, the feelings of the passenger who is almost imperceptibly\r\ncarried up into the air in a carriage of the Great Wheel, but the\r\nvertical direction of the movement, and the gradual expansion of the\r\nhorizon as the vertex is approached, lend an unwonted novelty to the\r\nsituation. From the Earl’s Court Wheel the view is both interesting and\r\nextensive, for on a clear day the prospect stretches as far as the Royal\r\nCastle of Windsor.\r\n\r\nThe “Gigantic Wheel” at Earl’s Court was inaugurated on the 11th July,\r\n1895, in the presence of an assemblage of 5,000 people, including many\r\ndistinguished personages, who were all treated to a ride. Plate I. shows\r\na portion of the wheel and carriages as in motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE V.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL VIEW OF THE GREAT WHEEL AT EARL’S COURT.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.—_Sir Joseph Whitworth._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the immense variety of tools and mechanical contrivances employed in\r\nmodern times, by far the greatest number are designed to impart to\r\ncertain materials some definite shape. The brickmaker’s mould, the\r\njoiner’s plane, the stonemason’s chisel, the potter’s wheel, are\r\nexamples of simple tools. More elaborate are the coining press, the\r\nmachine for planing iron, the drilling machine, the turning lathe, the\r\nrolling mill, the Jacquard loom. But all such tools and machines have\r\none principle in common—a principle which casual observers may easily\r\noverlook, but one which is of the highest importance, as its application\r\nconstitutes the very essence of the modern process of _manufacture_ as\r\ndistinguished from the slow and laborious mode of making things by hand.\r\nThe principle will be easily understood by a single example. Let it be\r\nrequired to draw straight lines across a sheet of paper. Few persons can\r\ntake a pen or pencil, and do this with even an approach to accuracy, and\r\nat best they can do it but slowly and imperfectly. But with the aid of a\r\nruler any number of straight lines may be drawn rapidly and surely. The\r\nformer case is an instance of _making_ by hand, the latter represents\r\n_manufacturing_, the ruler being the tool or machine. Let it be observed\r\nthat the ruler has in itself the kind of form required—that is to say,\r\nstraightness—and that in using it we copy or transfer this straightness\r\nto the mark made on the paper. This is a simple example of the _copying\r\nprinciple_, which is so widely applied in machines for manufacturing;\r\nfor, in all of these, materials are shaped or moulded by various\r\ncontrivances, so as to reproduce certain definite forms, which are in\r\nsome way contained within the machine itself. This will be distinctly\r\nseen in the tools which are about to be described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 28.—_Whitworth’s Screw Dies and Tap._\r\n]\r\n\r\nProbably no one mechanical contrivance is so much and so variously\r\napplied as the _Screw_. The common screw-nail, which is so often used by\r\ncarpenters for fastening pieces of metal on wood, or one piece of wood\r\nto another, is a specimen of the screw with which everybody is familiar.\r\nThe projection which winds spirally round the nail is termed the\r\n_thread_ of the screw, and the distance that the thread advances\r\nparallel to the axis in one turn is called the _pitch_. It is obvious\r\nthat for each turn the screw makes it is advanced into the wood a depth\r\nequal to the pitch, and that there is formed in the wood a hollow screw\r\nwith corresponding grooves and projections. Screws are formed on the\r\nends of the bolts, by which various parts are fastened together, and the\r\nhollow screws which turn on the ends of the bolts are termed _nuts_. The\r\nscrews on bolts and nuts, and other parts of machines, were formerly\r\nmade with so many different pitches that, when a machine constructed by\r\none maker had to be repaired by another, great inconvenience was found,\r\non account of the want of uniformity in the shape and pitch of the\r\nthreads. A uniform system was many years ago proposed by Sir Joseph\r\nWhitworth, and adopted by the majority of mechanical engineers, who\r\nagreed to use only a certain defined series of pitches. The same\r\nengineer also contrived a hand tool for cutting screws with greater\r\naccuracy than had formerly been attained in that process. A mechanic\r\noften finds it necessary to form a screw-thread on a bolt, and also to\r\nproduce in metal a hollow screw. The reader may have observed\r\ngas-fitters and other workmen performing the first operation by an\r\ninstrument having the same general appearance as Fig. 28. This contains\r\nhard steel _dies_, which are made to press on the bolt or pipe, so that\r\nwhen the _guide-stock_ is turned by the handles, the required grooves\r\nare cut out. The arrangement of these dies in Sir Joseph Whitworth’s\r\ninstrument is shown in Fig. 28, which represents the central part of the\r\nguide-stock; A, B, C are the steel dies retained in their places, when\r\nthe instrument is in use, by a plate which can be removed when it is\r\nnecessary to replace one set of dies by another, according to the pitch\r\nof thread required. The figure also shows the set of dies, A, B, C,\r\nremoved from the guide-stock. D is the work, pressed up against the\r\nfixed die, A, by B and C, the pressure being applied to these last as\r\nrequired by turning the nut, thus drawing up the key, E, so that the\r\ninclined planes, _f_, _g_, press against similar surfaces forming the\r\nends of the dies. For producing the hollow screws, _taps_ are provided,\r\nwhich are merely well-formed screws, made of hard steel and having the\r\nthreads cut into detached pieces by several longitudinal grooves, as\r\nrepresented in the lower part of Fig. 28.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.—_Screw-cutting Lathe._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe method of forming screws by dies and taps is, however, applicable\r\nonly to those of small dimensions, and even for these it is not employed\r\nwhere great accuracy is required. Perfect screws can only be cut with a\r\nlathe, such as that represented in Fig. 29. In this we must first call\r\nthe reader’s attention to the portion of the apparatus marked A, which\r\nreceives the name of the _slide-rest_. The invention of this contrivance\r\nby Maudsley had the effect of almost revolutionizing mechanical art, for\r\nby its aid it became possible to _produce true surfaces in the lathe_.\r\nBefore the slide-rest was introduced, the instrument which cut the wood\r\nor metal was held in the workman’s hand, and whatever might be his skill\r\nand strength, the steadiness and precision thus obtainable were far\r\ninferior to those which could be reached by the grip of an iron hand,\r\nguided by unswerving bars. The slide-rest was contrived by Maudsley in\r\nthe first instance for cutting screws, but its principle has been\r\napplied for other purposes. This principle consists in attaching the\r\ncutting tool to a slide which is incapable of any motion, except in the\r\none direction required. Thus the slide, A, represented in Fig. 29, moves\r\nalong the _bed_ of the lathe, B, carrying the cutter with perfect\r\nsteadiness in a straight line parallel to the axis of the lathe. There\r\nare also two other slides for adjusting the position of the cutter; the\r\nhandle, _a_, turns a screw, which imparts a transverse motion to the\r\npiece, _b_, and the tool receives another longitudinal movement from the\r\nhandle, _c_. The pieces are so arranged that these movements take place\r\nin straight lines in precisely the required direction, and without\r\npermitting the tool to be unsteady, or capable of any rocking motion. In\r\nWhitworth’s lathe, between the two sides of the bed, and therefore not\r\nvisible in the figure, is a shaft placed perfectly parallel to the axis\r\nof the lathe. One end of this shaft is seen carrying the wheel, C, which\r\nis connected with a train of wheels, D, and is thus made to revolve at a\r\nspeed which can be made to bear any required proportion to that of the\r\nmandril, E, of the lathe, by properly arranging the numbers of the teeth\r\nin the wheels; and the machine is provided with several sets of wheels,\r\nwhich can be substituted for each other. The greater part of the length\r\nof this shaft is formed with great care into an exceedingly accurate\r\nscrew, which works in a nut forming part of the slide-rest. The effect,\r\ntherefore, of the rotation of the screw is to cause the slide-rest to\r\ntravel along the bed of the lathe, advancing with each revolution of the\r\nscrew through a space equal to its pitch distance. There is an\r\narrangement for releasing the nut from the guiding-screw, by moving a\r\nlever, and then by turning the winch the slide-rest is moved along by a\r\nwheel engaging the teeth of a rack at the back of the lathe. Now, if the\r\ntrain of wheels, C D, be so arranged that the screw makes one revolution\r\nfor each turn of the mandril, it follows that the cutting tool will move\r\nlongitudinally a distance equal to the pitch of the guiding-screw while\r\nthe bar placed in the lathe makes one turn. Thus the point of the cutter\r\nwill form on the bar a screw having the same pitch as the guiding-screw\r\nof the lathe.\r\n\r\nHere we have a striking illustration of the copying principle, for the\r\nlathe thus produces an exact copy of the screw which it contains. The\r\nscrew-thread is traced out on the cylindrical bar, which is operated\r\nupon by the combination of the circular motion of the mandril with the\r\nlongitudinal movement of the slide-rest. By modifying the relative\r\namounts of these movements, screw-threads of any desired pitch can be\r\nmade, and it is for this purpose that the _change wheels_ are provided.\r\nIf the thread of the guiding-screw makes two turns in one inch, one\r\nrevolution of the wheel C will advance the cutter half an inch along the\r\nlength of the bar. If the numbers of teeth in the wheels be such that\r\nthe wheel D makes ten revolutions while C is making one, then in the\r\nlength of half an inch the thread of the screw produced by the cutter\r\nwill go round the core ten times, or, in technical language, the screw\r\nwill be of 1/20 inch pitch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 30.—_Whitworth’s Measuring Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSince a screw turning in a nut advances only its pitch distance at each\r\nrevolution, a finely-cut screw furnishes an instrument well adapted to\r\nimpart a slow motion, or to measure minute spaces. Suppose a screw is\r\ncut so as to have fifty threads in an inch, then each turn will advance\r\nit 1/50 in.; half a turn 1/100 in.; a quarter of a turn, 1/200, and so\r\non. It is quite easy to attach a graduated circle to the head of the\r\nscrew, so that, by a fixed pointer at the circumference, any required\r\nfraction of a revolution may be read off. Thus if the circle had two\r\nhundred equal parts, we could, by turning the screw so that one division\r\npassed the index, cause the screw to advance through 1/200 of 1/50 inch,\r\nor 1/10000 part of an inch. This is the method adopted for moving the\r\ncross-wires of the instruments for measuring very small spaces under the\r\nmicroscope. Sir Joseph Whitworth, who has done so many great things in\r\nmechanical art, was the first mechanician to perceive the importance of\r\nextreme accuracy of workmanship, and he invented many beautiful\r\ninstruments and processes by which this accuracy might be attained. Fig.\r\n30 represents one of his measuring machines, intended for practical use\r\nin the workshop, to test the dimensions of pieces of metal where great\r\nprecision is required. The base of the machine is constructed of a rigid\r\ncast iron bed bearing a fixed headstock, A, and a movable one, B, the\r\nlatter sliding along the bed, C, with a slow movement, when the handle,\r\nD, is turned. This slow motion is produced by a screw on the axis, _a_,\r\nworking in the lower part of the headstock, just as the slide-rest is\r\nmoved along the bed of the lathe. The movable headstock, when it has\r\nbeen moved into the position required, is firmly clamped by a\r\nthumbscrew. The face of the bed is graduated into inches and their\r\nsubdivisions. Here it should be explained that the machine is not\r\nintended to be used for ascertaining the absolute dimensions of objects,\r\nbut for showing by what fraction of an inch the size of the work\r\nmeasured differs from a certain standard piece. Each headstock carries a\r\nscrew of 1/20 inch pitch, made with the greatest possible care and\r\naccuracy. To the head of the screw in the movable headstock is attached\r\nthe wheel, _b_, having its circumference divided into 250 equal parts,\r\nand a fixed index, _c_, from which its graduations may be counted. An\r\nexactly similar arrangement is presented in connection with the screw\r\nturning in the fixed headstock, but the wheel is much larger, and its\r\ncircumference is divided in 500 equal parts. It follows, therefore, that\r\nif the large wheel be turned so that one division passes the index, the\r\nbar moves in a straight line 1/500 of the 1/20 of an inch, that is,\r\n1/10000 an inch. The ends of the bars, _d_ and _e_, are formed with\r\nperfectly plane and parallel surfaces, and an ingenious method is\r\nadopted of securing equality of pressure when comparisons are made. A\r\nplate of steel, with perfectly parallel faces, called a _gravity-piece_,\r\nor _feeler_, is placed between the flat end of the bar and the\r\nstandard-piece, and the pressure when the screw-reading is taken must be\r\njust sufficient to prevent this piece of steel from slipping down, and\r\nthat is the case when the steel remains suspended and can nevertheless\r\nbe easily made to slide about by a touch of the finger. Thus any piece\r\nwhich, with the same screw-readings, sustains the gravity-piece in the\r\nsame manner as the standard, will be of exactly the same length; or the\r\nnumber of divisions through which the large wheel must be turned to\r\nenable it to do so tells the difference of the dimensions in\r\nten-thousandth parts of an inch. By this instrument, therefore, gauges,\r\npatterns, &c., can be verified with the greatest precision, and pieces\r\ncan be reproduced perfectly agreeing in their dimensions with a standard\r\npiece. Thus, for example, the diameters of shafting can be brought with\r\nthe greatest precision to the exact size required to best fit their\r\nbearings.\r\n\r\nIn another measuring machine on the same principle the delicacy of the\r\nmeasurement has been carried still farther, by substituting for the\r\nlarge divided wheel one having 200 teeth, which engage an endless screw\r\nor worm. This will easily be understood by reference to Fig. 31, where a\r\nsimilar arrangement is applied to another purpose. Imagine that a wheel\r\nlike P, Fig. 31, but with 200 teeth, has taken the place of E in Fig.\r\n30, and that the wheel, T, on the axis of the endless screw is shaped\r\nlike E, Fig. 30. One turn of the axis carrying the endless screw,\r\ntherefore, turns the wheel through 1/200 of a revolution, and as this\r\naxis bears a graduated head, having 250 divisions, the screw having 20\r\nthreads to the inch, is, when one division passes the index, advanced\r\nthrough a space equal to 1/250 × 1/200 × 1/20, or 1/1000000 an inch;\r\nthat is, the one-millionth part of an inch. This is an interval so small\r\nthat ten times its length would hardly be appreciated with the highest\r\npowers of the microscope, and the machine is far too delicate for any\r\npractical requirements of the present day. It will indicate the\r\nexpansion caused by heat in an iron bar which has merely been touched\r\nwith the finger for an instant, and even the difference of length\r\nproduced by the heat radiated from the person using it. A movement of\r\n1/1000000 of an inch is shown by the gravity-piece remaining suspended\r\ninstead of falling, and the piece falls again when the tangent-screw is\r\nturned back through 1/250 of a revolution, a difference of reading\r\nrepresenting a possible movement of the measuring surface through only\r\n2/1000000 an inch. This proves the marvellous perfection of the\r\nworkmanship, for it shows that the amount of play in the bearings of the\r\nscrews does not exceed one-millionth of an inch.\r\n\r\nA good example of a machine-tool is the _Drilling Machine_, which is\r\nused for drilling holes in metal. Such a machine is represented in Fig.\r\n31, where A is the strong framing, which is cast in a single piece, in\r\norder to render it as rigid as possible. The power is applied by means\r\nof a strap round the speed pulley, B, by which a regulated speed is\r\ncommunicated to the bevel wheel, C, which drives D, and thus causes the\r\nrotation of the hollow shaft, E. In the lower part of the latter is the\r\nspindle which carries the drilling tool, F, and upon this spindle is a\r\nlongitudinal groove, into which fits a projection on the inside of E.\r\nThe spindle is thus forced to rotate, and is at the same time capable of\r\nmoving up and down. The top of the spindle is attached to the lower end\r\nof the rack, G, by a joint which allows the spindle to rotate freely\r\nwithout being followed in its rotation by the rack, although the latter\r\ncommunicates all its vertical movements to the spindle, as if the two\r\nformed one piece. The teeth of the rack are engaged by a pinion, which\r\ncarries on its axis the wheel H, turned by an endless screw on the\r\nshaft, I, which derives its motion by means of another wheel and endless\r\nscrew from the shaft, K. The latter is driven by a strap passing over\r\nthe _speed pulleys_, L and M, and thus the speed of the shaft K can be\r\nmodified as required by passing the strap from one pair of pulleys to\r\nanother. The result is that the rack is depressed by a slow movement,\r\nwhich advances the drill in the work, or, as it is technically termed,\r\ngives the _feed_ to the drill. By a simple piece of mechanism at N the\r\nconnection of the shafts K and I can be broken, and the handle O made to\r\ncommunicate a more rapid movement to I, so as to raise up the drill in a\r\nposition to begin its work again, or to bring it quickly down to the\r\nwork, and then the arrangement for the self-acting feed is again brought\r\ninto play. By turning the wheel, P, the table, Q, on which the work is\r\nfastened, is capable of being raised or lowered, by means of a rack\r\nwithin the piece R, acted on by a pinion carried on the axle, P. The\r\ntable also admits of a horizontal motion by the slide S, and may besides\r\nbe swung round when required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 31.—_Whitworth’s Drilling Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe visitor to an engineer’s workshop cannot fail to be struck with the\r\noperation of the powerful _Lathes_ and _Planing Machines_, by which long\r\nthick flakes or shavings of iron are removed from pieces of metal with\r\nthe same apparent ease as if the machine were paring cheese. The figure\r\non the opposite page represents one of the larger forms of the planing\r\nmachine, as constructed by Sir J. Whitworth. The piece of work to be\r\nplaned is firmly bolted down to the table, A, which moves upon the\r\nᏙ-shaped surfaces, running its whole length, and accurately fitting into\r\ncorresponding grooves in a massive cast iron bed. The bevel wheel, of\r\nwhich a portion is seen at B, is keyed on a screw, which extends\r\nlongitudinally from end to end of the bed. This screw works in nuts\r\nforming part of the table, and as it turns in sockets at the ends of the\r\nbed, it does not itself move forward, but imparts a progressive movement\r\nto the table, and therefore to the piece of metal to be planed. As this\r\ntable must move backwards and forwards, there must be some contrivance\r\nfor reversing the direction of the screw’s rotation, and this is\r\naccomplished in a beautifully simple manner by an arrangement which a\r\nlittle consideration will enable any one to understand. It will be\r\nobserved that there are three drum-pulleys at C. Let the reader confine,\r\nfor the present, his attention to the nearest one, and picture to\r\nhimself that the shaft to which it is attached is placed in the same\r\nhorizontal plane as the axis of the screw and at right angles to it,\r\npassing in front of bevel wheel B. A small bevel wheel turning with this\r\nshaft, and engaging the teeth of the wheel B, may, it is plain,\r\ncommunicate motion to the screw. Now let the reader consider what will\r\nbe the effect on the _direction_ of the rotation of B of applying the\r\nbevelled pinion to the nearer or to the farther part of its\r\ncircumference, supposing the direction of the rotation of this pinion to\r\nbe always the same. He will perceive that the direction in one case will\r\nbe the reverse of that in the other. The shaft to which the nearest\r\npulley is attached carries a pinion engaging the wheel at its farther\r\nedge, and therefore the rotation of this pulley in the same direction as\r\nthe hands of a watch causes the wheel B to rotate so that its upper part\r\nmoves towards the spectator. The farthest pulley, _a_, turns with a\r\nhollow shaft, through which the shaft of the nearest pulley simply\r\npasses, without any connection between them, and this hollow shaft\r\ncarries a pinion, which engages the teeth of B at the nearer edge, and,\r\nin consequence, the rotation of the farther pulley, _a_, in the\r\ndirection of the hands of a watch, would cause the upper part of B to be\r\nmoving from the spectator. The middle pulley, _b_, runs loosely on the\r\nshaft, and the driving-strap passes through the guide, _c_, and it is\r\nonly necessary to move this, so as to shift the strap from one drum to\r\nanother, in order to reverse the direction of the screw and the motion.\r\nThis shifting of the strap is done by a movement derived from the table\r\nitself, on which are two adjustable stops, D and E, acting on an\r\narrangement at the base of the upright frame when they are brought up to\r\nit by the movement of the table, so as not only to shift the strap, but\r\nalso to impart a certain amount of rotation to upright shaft, F, in each\r\ndirection alternately. The piece which carries the tools, G and H, is\r\nplaced horizontally, and can be moved vertically by turning the axis, I,\r\nthus causing an equal rotation of two upright screws of equal pitch,\r\nwhich are contained within the uprights and work in nuts, forming part\r\nof the tool-box. The pieces carrying the tools are moved horizontally by\r\nthe screws which are seen to pass along the tool-box, and these screws\r\nreceive a certain regulated amount of motion at each reversal of the\r\nmovement of the table from the mechanism shown at K. The band-pulley, L,\r\nreceives a certain amount of rotation from the same shaft, and the\r\ncatgut band passing round the tops of the cylinders which carry the\r\ncutters is drawn in alternate directions at the end of each stroke, the\r\neffect being to turn the cutters half round, so as always to present\r\ntheir cutting edges to the work. There are also contrivances for\r\nmaintaining the requisite steadiness in the tools and for adjusting the\r\ndepth of the cut. The cutting edge of the tools is usually of a Ꮩ-shape,\r\nwith the angle slightly rounded, and the result of the process is not\r\nthe production of a plane, but a grooved surface. But by diminishing the\r\namount of horizontal _feed_ given to the cutters, the grooves may be\r\nmade finer and finer, until at length they disappear, and the surface is\r\npractically a plane. Planing machines are sometimes of a very large\r\nsize. Sir J. Whitworth has one the table of which is 50 ft. in length,\r\nand the machine is capable of making a straight cut 40 ft. long in any\r\narticle not exceeding 10 ft. 6 in. high or 10 ft. wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—_Whitworth’s Planing Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 33.—_Pair of Whitworth’s Planes, or Surface Plates._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe copying principle is evident in this machine; for the plane surface\r\nresults from the combination of the straightness of the bed with the\r\nstraightness of the transverse slide along which the tools are moved. It\r\nshould, moreover, be observed that it is precisely this machine which\r\nwould be employed for preparing the straight sliding surfaces required\r\nin the construction of planing and other machines, and thus one of these\r\nengines becomes the parent, as it were, of many others having the same\r\nfamily likeness, and so on _ad infinitum_. Thus, having once obtained\r\nperfectly true surfaces, we can easily reproduce similar surfaces. But\r\nthe reader may wish to know how such forms have been obtained in the\r\nfirst instance; how, for example, could a perfectly plane surface be\r\nfashioned without any standard for comparison? This was first perfectly\r\ndone by Sir J. Whitworth, forty-five years ago. Three pieces of iron\r\nhave each a face wrought into comparatively plane surfaces; they are\r\ncompared together, and the parts which are prominent are reduced first\r\nby filing, but afterwards, as the process approaches completion, by\r\nscraping, until the three perfectly coincide. The parts where the plates\r\ncome in contact with each other are ascertained by smearing one of them\r\nwith a little oil coloured with red ochre: when another is pressed\r\nagainst it, the surfaces of contact are shown by the transference of the\r\nred colour. Three plates are required, for it is possible for the\r\nprominences of No. 1 exactly to fit into the hollows of No. 2, but in\r\nthat case _both_ could not possibly exactly coincide with the surface of\r\nNo. 3; for if one of them did (say No. 1), then No. 3 must be exactly\r\nsimilar to No. 2, and consequently when No. 2 was applied to No. 3,\r\nhollow would be opposed to hollow and prominence to prominence. A little\r\nreflection will show that only when the three surfaces are truly plane\r\nwill they exactly and entirely coincide with each other. The planes,\r\nwhen thus carefully prepared, approach to the perfection of the ideal\r\nmathematical form, and they are used in the workshop for testing the\r\ncorrectness of surfaces, by observing the uniformity or otherwise of the\r\nimpression they give to the surface when brought into contact with it,\r\nafter being covered by a very thin layer of oil coloured by\r\nfinely-ground red ochre.\r\n\r\nFig. 33 represents a small pair of Whitworth’s planes. When one of these\r\nis placed horizontally upon the other, it does not appear to actually\r\ncome in contact with it, for the surfaces are so true that the air does\r\nnot easily escape, but a thin film supports the upper plate, which\r\nglides upon it with remarkable readiness (A). When, however, one plate\r\nis made to slide over the other, so as to exclude the air, they may both\r\nbe lifted by raising the upper one (B). This effect has, by several\r\nphilosophers, been attributed to the mere pressure of the atmosphere;\r\nbut recent experiments of Professor Tyndall’s show that the plates\r\nadhere even in a vacuum. The adhesion appears therefore to be due to\r\nsome force acting between the substances of the plates, and perhaps\r\nidentical in kind with that which binds together the particles of the\r\niron itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 34.—_Interior of Engineer’s Workshop._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 35.—_The Blanchard Lathe._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _THE BLANCHARD LATHE._\r\n\r\nThis machine affords a striking example of the application of the\r\ncopying principle which is the fundamental feature of modern\r\nmanufacturing processes. It would hardly be supposed possible, until the\r\nmethod had been explained, that articles in shape so unlike geometrical\r\nforms as gun-stocks, shoemakers’ lasts, &c., could be turned in a lathe.\r\nThe mode in which this is accomplished is, however, very simple in idea,\r\nthough in carrying that idea into practice much ingenious contrivance\r\nwas required. The illustration, Fig. 35, represents a Blanchard’s lathe,\r\nvery elegantly constructed by Messrs. Greenwood and Batley, of Leeds.\r\nThe first obvious difference between an ordinary lathe and Blanchard’s\r\ninvention is that in the former the work revolves rapidly and the\r\ncutting-tool is stationary, or only slowly shifts its position in order\r\nto act on fresh portions of the work, while in the latter the work is\r\nslowly rotated and the cutting-tools are made to revolve with very great\r\nvelocity. Again, it will be observed that the headstock of the Blanchard\r\nlathe, instead of one, bears _two_ mandrels, having their axes parallel\r\nto each other. One of these carries the pattern, C, which in the figure\r\nhas the exact shape of a gun-stock that is to be cut in the piece of\r\nwood mounted on the nearer spindle. One essential condition in the\r\narrangement of the apparatus is that the pattern and the work having\r\nbeen fixed in similar and parallel positions, shall always continue so\r\nat every point of their revolutions. This is easily accomplished by\r\nplacing exactly similar toothed wheels on the two axles, and causing\r\nthese to be turned by one and the same smaller toothed wheel or pinion.\r\nThe two axles must thus always turn round in the same direction and with\r\nexactly the same speed, so that the work which is attached to one, and\r\nthe pattern which is fixed on the other, will always be in the same\r\nphase of their revolutions. If, for example, the part of the wood which\r\nis to form the upper part of the gun-stock is at the bottom, the\r\ncorresponding part of the pattern will also be at the bottom, as in the\r\nfigure, and both will turn round together, so that every part of each\r\nwill be at every instant in a precisely similar position. The wood to be\r\noperated upon is, it must be understood, roughly shaped before it is put\r\ninto the lathe. The toothed wheels and the pinion which drives them are\r\nin the figure hid from view by the casing, _h_, which covers them. The\r\npinion receives the power from a strap passing over _f_. The cutters are\r\nshown at _e_; they are placed radially, like the spokes of a wheel, and\r\nhave all their cutting edges at precisely one certain distance from the\r\naxis on which they revolve, so that they all travel through the same\r\ncircle. These cutting-edges, it may be observed, are very narrow, almost\r\npointed. The shaft carrying the cutters is driven at a very high speed,\r\nby means of a strap passing over _k_ and _i_. The number of revolutions\r\nmade by the cutters in one second is usually more than thirty. The great\r\npeculiarity of the lathe consists in the manner in which the position of\r\nthe cutters is made to vary. The axle which carries them rotates in a\r\nkind of frame, which can move backwards and forwards, so that the\r\ncutters may be readily put at any desired distance from the axis of the\r\nwork. Their position is, however, always dependent on the pattern, for,\r\nfixed in a similar frame, _b_, which is connected with the former, is a\r\nsmall disc wheel, _a_, having precisely the same radius as that of the\r\ncircle traced out by the cutters, and this disc is made by a strong\r\nspring to press against the pattern. The cutters, being fixed in the\r\nsame rocking-frame which carries this guiding-wheel, must partake of all\r\nits backward and forward motions, and as the cutting-wheel and the\r\nguide-wheel are so arranged as to have always the same relative\r\npositions to the axes of the two headstocks, it follows that the edges\r\nof the cutters will trace out identically the same form as the\r\ncircumference of the guiding-disc. The latter is, of course, not driven\r\nround, but simply turns slowly with the pattern by friction, for it is\r\npressed firmly against the pattern by a spring or weight acting on the\r\nframe, in order that the cutters may be steadily maintained in their\r\ntrue, but ever-varying, position. The rocking-frame receives a slow\r\nlongitudinal motion by means of the screw, _n_, so that the cutters are\r\ncarried along the work, and the guide along the pattern.\r\n\r\nThe whole arrangement is self-acting, so that when once the pattern and\r\nthe rough block of wood have been fixed in their positions, the machine\r\ncompletes the work, and produces an exact repetition of the shape of the\r\npattern. It is plain that any kind of forms can be easily cut by this\r\nlathe, the only condition being that the surface of the pattern must not\r\npresent any re-entering portions which the edge of the guide-wheel\r\ncannot follow. The machine is largely used for the purposes named above,\r\nand also for the manufacture of the spokes of carriage-wheels. The\r\nlimits of this article will not permit of a description of the beautiful\r\nadjustments given to the mechanism in the example before us,\r\nparticularly in the arrangement for driving the cutters in a framework\r\ncombining lateral and longitudinal motions; but the intelligent reader\r\nmay gather some hints of these by a careful inspection of the figure.\r\nThe machine is sometimes made with the frame carrying the guide-wheel\r\nand cutters, not rocking but sliding in a direction transverse to the\r\naxes of the headstocks. It is extremely interesting to see the Blanchard\r\nlathe at work, and observe how perfectly and rapidly the curves and form\r\nof the patterns seem to grow, as it were, out of the rudely-shaped piece\r\nof wood, which, of course, contains a large excess of material, or, in\r\nthe picturesque and expressive phrase of the workmen, _always gives the\r\nmachine something to eat_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 36.—_Vertical Saw._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _SAWING MACHINES._\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the last, all the machines hitherto described in\r\nthe present article are distinguished by this—they are tools which are\r\nused to produce other machines of every kind. Without such implements it\r\nwould be impossible to fashion the machines which are made to serve so\r\nmany different ends. Another peculiarity of these tools has also been\r\nreferred to, namely, that they are especially serviceable, and indeed\r\nessential, for the reproduction of others of the same class. Thus, the\r\naccurate leading-screw of the lathe is the means used to cut other\r\naccurate screws, which shall in their turn become the leading-screws of\r\nother lathes, and a lathe which forms a truly circular figure is a\r\nnecessary implement for the construction of another lathe which shall\r\nalso produce truly circular figures. In these tools, therefore, we find\r\nthe copying principle, to which allusion has been already made, as the\r\ngreat feature of all machines; but in order to bring this principle\r\nstill more clearly before the reader, we have described in the Blanchard\r\nLathe a machine of a somewhat different class, because it embodied a\r\nvery striking illustration of the principle in question. We are far from\r\nhaving described all the implements of the mechanical engineer, or even\r\nall the more interesting ones; for example, we have given no account of\r\nthe powerful lathes in which great masses of iron are turned, or of the\r\nanalogous machines, which, with so much accuracy, shape the internal\r\nsurfaces of the cylinders of steam engines, of cannons, &c. The history\r\nof the steam engine tells us of the difficulties which Watt had to\r\ncontend with in the construction of his cylinders, for no machine at\r\nthat time existed capable of boring them with an approach to the\r\nprecision which is now obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 37.—_Circular Saw._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe kind of general interest which attaches to the tools we have already\r\ndescribed is not wanting in yet another class of machine-tools, namely,\r\nthose employed in converting timber into the forms required to adapt it\r\nfor the uses to which it is so extensively applied. And for popular\r\nillustration, this class of tools presents the special advantage of\r\nbeing readily understood as regards their purpose and mode of action,\r\nwhile their simplicity in these respects does not prevent them from\r\nshowing the advantages of machine over hand labour. Everybody is\r\nfamiliar with the up-and-down movement of a common saw, and in the\r\nmachine for sawing balks of timber into planks, represented in Fig. 36,\r\nthis reciprocating motion is retained, but there are a number of saws\r\nfixed parallel to each other in a strong frame, at a distance\r\ncorresponding to the thickness of the planks. The saws are not placed\r\nwith their cutting edges quite upright, but these are a little more\r\nforward at the top, so that as they descend they cut into the wood, but\r\nmove upwards without cutting, for the teeth then recede from the line of\r\nthe previous cut, while in the meantime the balk is pushed forward ready\r\nfor the next descent of the saw-frame. This pushing forward, or\r\n_feeding_, of the timber is accomplished by means of ratchet-wheels,\r\nwhich are made to revolve through a certain space after each descent of\r\nthe saw-frame, and, by turning certain pinions, move forward the\r\ncarriage on which the piece of timber is firmly fixed, so that when the\r\nblades of the saws are beginning the next descent they are already in\r\ncontact with the edge of the former cut. To prevent the blades from\r\nmoving with injurious friction in the saw-cuts, these last are made of\r\nsomewhat greater width than the thickness of the blades, by the simple\r\nplan of bending the teeth a little on one side and on the other\r\nalternately. The rapidity with which the machine works, depends of\r\ncourse on the kind of wood operated upon, but it is not unusual for such\r\na machine to make more than a hundred cuts in the minute. The figure\r\nshows the machine as deriving its motion by means of a strap passing\r\nover a drum, from shafting driven by a steam engine. This is the usual\r\nplan, but sometimes the steam power is applied directly, by fixing the\r\npiston-rod of a steam cylinder to the top of the saw-frame, and\r\nequalizing the motion by a fly-wheel on a shaft, turned by a crank and\r\nconnecting-rod.\r\n\r\nA very effective machine for cutting pieces of wood of moderate\r\ndimensions is the _Circular Saw_, represented in Fig. 37. Here there is\r\na steel disc, having its rim formed into teeth; and the disc is made to\r\nrevolve with very great speed, in some cases making as many as five\r\nhundred turns in a minute, or more than eight in a second. On the bench\r\nis an adjustable straight guide, or fence, and when this has been fixed,\r\nthe workman has only to press the piece of wood against it, and push the\r\nwood at the same time towards the saw, which cuts it at a very rapid\r\nrate. Sometimes the circular saw is provided with apparatus by which the\r\nmachine itself pushes the wood forwards, and the only attention required\r\nfrom the workman is the fixing of the wood upon the bench, and the\r\nsetting of the machine in gear with the driving-shaft. Similar saws are\r\nused for squaring the ends of the iron rails for railways, two circular\r\nsaws being fixed upon one axle at a distance apart equal to the length\r\nof the rails. The axle is driven at the rate of about 900 turns per\r\nminute, and the iron rail is brought up parallel to the axle, being\r\nmounted on a carriage, and still red hot, when the two ends are cut at\r\nthe same time by the circular saws, the lower parts of which dip into\r\ntroughs of water to keep them cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 38.—_Pit-Saw._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 39.—_Box Tunnel._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               RAILWAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 40.—_Coal-pit, Salop._\r\n]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of last century, tramways formed by laying down narrow\r\nplates of iron, were in use at mines and collieries in several parts of\r\nEngland. These plates had usually a projection or flange on the inner\r\nedge, thus—L, in order to keep the waggons on the track, for the wheels\r\nthemselves had no flange, but were of the kind used on ordinary roads.\r\nThese flat tramways were found liable to become covered up with dirt and\r\ngravel, so that the benefit which ought to have been obtained from their\r\nsmoothness was in a great measure lost. _Edge rails_ were, therefore,\r\nsubstituted, and the wheels were kept on the rails by having a _flange_\r\ncast on the inner edge of the rim. The rails were then always made of\r\ncast iron, for, although they were very liable to break, the great cost\r\nof making them of wrought iron prevented that material from being used\r\nuntil 1820, when the method of forming rails of malleable iron by\r\nrolling came into use. The first time a tramway was used for the\r\nconveyance of passengers was in 1825, when the Stockton and Darlington\r\nRailway was opened—a length of thirty-seven miles. It appears that the\r\ncarriages were at first drawn by horses, although locomotives were used\r\non this and other colliery lines for dragging, at a slow rate, trains of\r\nmineral waggons. At that time engineers were exercising their ingenuity\r\nin overcoming a difficulty which never existed by devising plans for\r\ngiving tractive power to the locomotive through the instrumentality of\r\nrack-work rails. It never occurred to them to first try whether the\r\nadhesion of the smooth wheel to the smooth rail was not sufficient for\r\nthe purpose. During the first quarter of the present century the greater\r\npart of the goods and much passenger traffic was monopolized by the\r\ncanals. It is quoted, as a proof of the careless manner in which this\r\nservice was performed, that the transport of bales of cotton from\r\nLiverpool to Manchester sometimes occupied twice the length of time\r\nrequired in their voyage across the Atlantic. When an Act of Parliament\r\nauthorizing the construction of a railway between Liverpool and\r\nManchester was applied for, the canal companies succeeded in retarding,\r\nby their influence, the passing of that Act for two years. It was\r\npassed, however, in 1828, and the construction of the line was proceeded\r\nwith. This line was at first intended only for the conveyance of goods,\r\nespecially of cotton and cotton manufactures, and the waggons were to be\r\ndrawn by horses. When the line was nearly finished the idea of employing\r\nhorses was, at the instigation of Mr. George Stephenson, abandoned in\r\nfavour of steam power. The directors were divided in opinion as to\r\nwhether the carriage should be dragged by ropes wound on large drums by\r\nstationary engines, or whether locomotives should be employed. Finally,\r\nthe latter plan was adopted, and it was also suggested that passengers\r\nmight be carried. The directors offered a prize for the best locomotive,\r\nand the result has been already mentioned. In the light of our\r\nexperience since that time, it is curious to read of the doubts then\r\nentertained by skilful engineers about the success of the locomotive. In\r\na serious treatise on the subject, one eminent authority hoped “that he\r\nmight not be confounded with those hot-brained enthusiasts who\r\nmaintained the possibility of carriages being driven by a steam engine\r\non a railway at such a speed as twelve miles an hour.” When the “Rocket”\r\nhad accomplished the unprecedented velocity of twenty-nine miles an\r\nhour, and the railway was opened for passengers as well as goods, the\r\nthirty stage coaches daily plying between Liverpool and Manchester found\r\ntheir occupation gone, and all ceased to run except one, which had to\r\ndepend on the roadside towns only, while the daily number of passengers\r\nbetween the two cities rose at once from 500 to 1,600. In that\r\ndelightful book, Smiles’s “Life of George Stephenson,” may be found most\r\ninteresting details of the difficulties attending the introduction of\r\nrailways, especially with regard to the construction of this first\r\nimportant line. Mr. Smiles relates how the promoters of the scheme\r\nstruggled against “vested interests;” how the canal proprietors,\r\nconfident at first of a secure and continuous enjoyment of their\r\nmonopoly, ridiculed the proposed railway, and continued their exorbitant\r\ncharges and tardy conveyance, pocketing in profits the prime cost of\r\ntheir canal about every three years; how, roused into active opposition,\r\nthey did all in their power to thwart the new scheme; how the Lord Derby\r\nand the Lord Sefton of that day, and other landowners, offered every\r\nresistance to the surveyors; how the Duke of Bridgewater’s farmers would\r\nnot allow them to enter their fields, and the Duke’s gamekeepers had\r\norders to shoot them; how even a clergyman threatened them with personal\r\nviolence, and they had to do their work by stealth, while the reverend\r\ngentleman was conducting the services in his church; how newspaper and\r\nother writers declared that the locomotives would kill the birds,\r\nprevent cows from grazing and hens from laying, burn houses, and cause\r\nthe extinction of the race of horses. All the civil engineers scouted\r\nthe idea of a locomotive railway, and Stephenson was held up to derision\r\nas an ignoramus and a maniac by the “most eminent lawyers,” and the most\r\nadvanced and “respectable” professional C.E.s of the time. An article\r\nappeared in the “Quarterly Review,” very favourable to the construction\r\nof railways, but remarking in reference to a proposed line between\r\nLondon and Woolwich: “What can be more palpably absurd and ridiculous\r\nthan the prospect held out of locomotives travelling _twice as fast as\r\nstage coaches_! We should as soon expect the people of Woolwich to\r\nsuffer themselves to be fired off upon one of Congreve’s _ricochet_\r\nrockets as trust themselves to the mercy of a machine going at such a\r\nrate. We will back old Father Thames against the Woolwich Railway for\r\nany sum. We trust that Parliament will, in all railways it may sanction,\r\nlimit the speed to _eight or nine miles an hour_, which we entirely\r\nagree with Mr. Sylvester is as great as can be ventured on with safety.”\r\nThis passage, which reads so strangely now, may be seen in the\r\n“Quarterly Review” for March, 1825. But still more curious appear now\r\nthe reports of the debates in Parliament, and of the evidence taken\r\nbefore the Parliamentary Committee, in which we find the opinions and\r\nfears of the best informed men of that period, and trace the frantic\r\nefforts of the holders of the “vested interests” to retain them, however\r\nobstructive of the public good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.—_Sankey Viaduct._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 42.—_Rails and Cramp-gauge._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen it has been decided to construct a railway between two places, the\r\nlaying-out of the line is a subject requiring great consideration and\r\nthe highest engineering skill—for the matter is, on account of the great\r\ncost, much more important than the setting-out of a common road. The\r\nidea of a perfect railroad is that of a straight and level line from one\r\nterminus to another; but there are many circumstances which prevent such\r\nan idea from being ever carried into practice. First, it is desirable\r\nthat the line should pass through important towns situated near the\r\nroute; and then the cost of making the roadway straight and level, in\r\nspite of natural obstacles, would be often so great, that to avoid it\r\ndetours and inclines must be submitted to—the inconvenience and the\r\nincreased length of road being balanced by the saving in the cost of\r\nconstruction. It is the business of the engineer who lays out the line\r\nto take all these circumstances into consideration, after he has made a\r\ncareful survey of the country through which the line is to pass. The\r\ncost of making railways varies, of course, very much according to the\r\nnumber and extent of the tunnels, cuttings, embankments, or other works\r\nrequired. The average cost of each mile of railway in Great Britain may\r\nbe stated as about £35,000. The road itself when the rails are laid down\r\nis called _the permanent way_, perhaps originally in distinction to the\r\ntemporary tramways laid down by the contractors during the progress of\r\nthe works. The permanent way is formed first of _ballast_, which is a\r\nlayer of gravel, stone, or other carefully chosen material, about 2 ft.\r\ndeep, spread over the roadway. Above the ballast and partly embedded in\r\nit are placed the _sleepers_, which is the name given to the pieces of\r\ntimber on which the rails rest. These timbers are usually placed\r\ntransversely—that is, across the direction of the rails, in the manner\r\nshown in Fig. 42. This figure also represents the form of rails most\r\ncommonly adopted, and exhibits the mode in which they are fastened down\r\nto the sleepers by means of the iron _chairs_, _b_ _c_, the rail being\r\nfirmly held in its place by an oak wedge, _d_. These wedges are driven\r\nin while the rails are maintained at precisely the required distance\r\napart by the implement, _e f_, called a _cramp gauge_, the chairs having\r\npreviously been securely attached to the sleepers by bolts or nails. The\r\ndouble ⟙ form of rail has several important advantages, such as its\r\ncapability of being reversed when the upper surface is worn out, and the\r\nreadiness with which the ends of the rails can be joined by means of\r\n_fish-plates_. These are shown in Fig. 43, where in a we are supposed to\r\nbe looking down on the rails, and in B to be looking at them sideways.\r\nIn Fig. 44 we have the rail and fish-plates in section. The holes in the\r\nrails through which the bolts pass are not round but oval, so that a\r\ncertain amount of play is permitted to the ends of the rails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 43.—_Fish-plate._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt may easily be seen on looking at a line of rails that they are not\r\nlaid with the ends quite touching each other, or, at least, they are not\r\nusually in contact. The reason of this is that space must be allowed for\r\nthe expansion which takes place when a rise in the temperature occurs.\r\nIf the rails are laid down when at the greatest temperature they are\r\nlikely to be subject to, they may then be placed in actual contact; but\r\nin cold weather a space will be left by their contraction. For this\r\nreason it is usual when rails are laid to allow a certain interval; thus\r\nrails 20 ft. long laid when the temperature is 70°, are placed with\r\ntheir ends 1/20th of an inch apart, at 30° 1/10th of an inch apart, and\r\nso on. The neglect of this precaution has sometimes led to damage and\r\naccidents. A certain railway was opened in June, and after an excursion\r\ntrain had in the morning passed over it, the midday heat so expanded the\r\niron, that the rails became in some places elevated 2 ft. above the\r\nlevel, and the sleepers were torn up; so that, in order to admit of the\r\nreturn of the train, the rails had to be hastily relaid in a kind of\r\nzigzag. In June, 1856, a train was thrown off the metals of the\r\nNorth-Eastern Railway, in consequence of the rails rising up through\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 44.—_Section of Rails and Fish-plates._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe distance between the rails in Great Britain is 4 ft. 8½ in., that\r\nwidth having been adopted by George Stephenson in the construction of\r\nthe earlier lines. Brunel, the engineer of the Great Western, adopted,\r\nhowever, in the construction of that railway, a gauge of 7 ft., with a\r\nview of obtaining greater speed and power in the engines, steadiness in\r\nthe carriages, and increased size of carriages for bulky goods. The\r\nproposal to adopt this gauge gave rise to a memorable dispute among\r\nengineers, often called “The Battle of the Gauges.” It was stated that\r\nany advantages of the broad gauge were more than compensated by its\r\ndisadvantages. The want of uniformity in the gauges was soon felt to be\r\nan inconvenience to the public, and a Parliamentary Committee was\r\nappointed to consider the subject. They reported that either gauge\r\nsupplied all public requirements, but that the broad gauge involved a\r\ngreat additional outlay in its construction without any compensating\r\nadvantages of economy in working; and, as at that time 2,000 miles of\r\nrailway had been constructed on the narrow gauge, whereas only 270 miles\r\nwere in existence on the broad gauge, they recommended that future\r\nrailways should be made the prevailing width of 56½ in. The Great\r\nWestern line had engines, bridges, tunnels, viaducts, &c., on a larger\r\nscale than any other railway in Britain. The difference of gauge was\r\nafter a time felt to involve so much inconvenience that lines which\r\nadopted the 7–ft. gauge have since relaid the tracks at the more common\r\nwidth. At the present day we find the Great Western Railway completely\r\nreconstructed on the narrow gauge system, in order that trains may run\r\nwithout interruption in connection with other lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 45.—_Conical Wheels._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 46.—_Centrifugal Force._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wheels of railway carriages and engines differ from those of\r\nordinary carriages in being fastened in pairs upon the axles, with which\r\nthey revolve (see Fig. 45). The tire of the wheel is conical, the slope\r\nbeing about 1 in 20; that is, in a wheel 5 in. broad the radius of the\r\nouter edge is ¼ in. less than that of the inner; and the rails are\r\nplaced sloping a little inwards. The effect of this conical figure is to\r\ncounteract any tendency to roll off the rails; for if a pair of wheels\r\nwere shifted a little to one side, the parts of the tires rolling upon\r\nthe rails being then of unequal circumference, would cause the wheels to\r\nroll towards the other side. The conical shape produces this kind of\r\nadjustment so well that the flanges do not in general touch the rails.\r\nThey act, however, as safeguards in passing over curves and junctions.\r\nIn curves the outer line of rails is laid higher than the inner, so that\r\nin passing over them the train leans slightly inwards, in order to\r\ncounteract what is called the centrifugal force, to which any body\r\nmoving in a curve is subject. This so-called force is merely the result\r\nof that tendency which every moving body has to continue its motion in a\r\nstraight line. A very good example of the effect of this may be seen\r\nwhen a circus horse is going rapidly round the ring. The inclination\r\ninwards is still more perceptible when a rider is standing on the\r\nhorse’s back, as shown in Fig. 46. The earth’s attraction of gravity is\r\npulling the performer straight down, and the centrifugal force would of\r\nitself throw her outwards horizontally. The resultant or combined effect\r\nof both acts is seen in the exact direction in which she is leaning, and\r\nit presses her feet on the horse’s back, the animal itself being under\r\nsimilar conditions. It is obvious that the amount of centrifugal force,\r\nand therefore of inward slope, will increase with the speed and\r\nsharpness of the curve, and on the railways the rails are placed so that\r\nthe slope counteracts the centrifugal force when the train travels at\r\nabout the rate of twenty miles per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 47.—_Points._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA very important part of the mechanism of a railway is the mode of\r\npassing trains from one line of rails to another. Engines and single\r\ncarriages are sometimes transferred by means of _turn-tables_, but the\r\nmore general plan is by _switches_, which are commonly constructed as\r\nshown in Fig. 47. There are two rails, A and B, tapering to a point and\r\nfixed at the other end, so that they have sufficient freedom to turn\r\nhorizontally. A train passing in the direction shown by the arrow would\r\ncontinue on the main line, if the points are placed as represented; but\r\nif they be moved so that the _long tongue_ is brought into contact with\r\nthe rail of the main line, then the train would run on to the side\r\nrails. These _points_ are worked by means of a lever attached to the\r\nrod, C, the lever being either placed near the rails, or in a\r\n_signal-box_, where a man is stationed, whose sole duty it is to attend\r\nto the points and to the signals. The interior of a signal-box near an\r\nimportant junction or station is shown in Fig. 48, and we see here the\r\nnumerous levers for working the points and the signals, each of these\r\nhaving a connection, by rods or wires, with the corresponding point or\r\nsignal-post. The electric telegraph is now an important agent in railway\r\nsignalling, and in a signal-box we may see the bells and instruments\r\nwhich inform the pointsman whether a certain section of the line is\r\n“blocked” or “clear.” The signals now generally used on British railways\r\nare made by the semaphore, which is simply a post from which an arm can\r\nbe made to project. When the driver of the train sees the arm projecting\r\nfrom the left-hand side of the post, it is an intimation to him that he\r\nmust stop his train; when the arm is dropped half-way, so as to project\r\n45° from the post, it is meant that he must proceed cautiously; when the\r\narm is down the line is clear. These signals, of course, are not capable\r\nof being seen at night, when their place is supplied with lamps,\r\nprovided with coloured glasses—red and green—and also with an uncoloured\r\nglass. The lamp may have the different glasses on three different sides,\r\nand be turned round so as to present the required colour; or it may be\r\nmade to do so without turning, if provided with a frame having red and\r\ngreen glasses, which can be moved like spectacles in front of it. The\r\nmeanings of the various coloured lights and the corresponding semaphore\r\nsignals are these:\r\n\r\n                  | White _All right_ Go on.\r\n                  ↿ Green _Caution_   Proceed slowly.\r\n                  ┓ Red   _Danger_    Stop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.—_Signal-box on the North London Railway._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA very clear account of the mode of working railway signals on what is\r\nnow called the _block system_, together with a graphic description of a\r\nsignal-box, was given in a paper which appeared some years ago in “The\r\nPopular Science Review,” from the pen of Mr. Charles V. Walker, F.R.S.,\r\nthe telegraph engineer to the South-Eastern Railway Company, who was the\r\nfirst to organize an efficient system of electric signalling for\r\nrailways. We may remark that the signalling instruments on the\r\nSouth-Eastern line, and indeed on all the lines at the present day,\r\naddress themselves both to the ear and to the eye, for they consist\r\nof—first, bells, on which one, two, or more blows are struck, each\r\nseries of blows having its own particular meaning; and, second, of a\r\nkind of miniature signal-post, with arms capable of being moved by\r\nelectric currents into positions similar to those of the arm of an\r\nactual signal-post, so that the position of the arms is made always to\r\nindicate the state of the line. One arm of the little signal-post—the\r\nleft—is red, and it has reference to _receding_ trains; the other—viz.,\r\nthe right—arm is white, and relates to _approaching_ trains. Mr. Walker\r\nthus describes the signalling:\r\n\r\n“The ordinary position of the arms of the electro-magnetic telegraph\r\nsemaphores will be down; that is to say, when the line is clear of all\r\ntrains, and business begins, say in early morning, all the arms will be\r\ndown, indicating that no train is moving. When the first train is ready\r\nto start, say from Charing Cross, the signalman will give the proper\r\nbell-signal to Belvidere—two, three, or four blows, according as the\r\ntrain is for Greenwich, for North Kent, or Mid-Kent, or for the main\r\nline; and the Belvidere man will acknowledge this by one blow on the\r\nbell in reply, and without raising the Charing Cross red or left arm.\r\nThis is the signal that the train may go on; and when the train has\r\npassed, so that the Charing Cross man can see the tail lights, he gives\r\nthe out signal a second time, which the Belvidere man acknowledges, at\r\nthe same time raising the red arm at Charing Cross, behind the train,\r\nand so protecting it until it has passed him at Belvidere, when he\r\nsignals to that effect to Charing Cross, at the same time putting down\r\nthe red arm there, as an indication that the line is again clear. While\r\nthese operations are going on for down trains, others precisely similar,\r\nbut in the reverse direction, are going on for up trains.... One and the\r\nsame pressure on the key sends a bell signal and raises or depresses the\r\nsemaphore arm as the case may require, a single telegraph wire only\r\nbeing required for the combined system, as for the more simple bell\r\nsystem.” In one of the signal-boxes on the South-Eastern line, Mr.\r\nWalker states, on a certain day 650 trains or engines were signalled and\r\nall particulars accurately entered in a book, the entries requiring the\r\nwriting down of nearly 8,000 figures: an illustration of the amount of\r\nwork quietly carried on in a signal-box for the advantage and security\r\nof the travelling public.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker also gives us a peep into the inside of one of the\r\nsignal-boxes, thus: “The interior of a large signal-box exhibits a very\r\nanimated scene, in which there are but two actors, a man and a boy, both\r\nas busy as bees, but with no hurry or bustle. The ruling genius of the\r\nplace is the strong, active, intelligent signalman, standing at one end\r\nof the apartment, the monarch for the time being of all he surveys.\r\nImmediately before him in one long line, extending from side to side, is\r\na goodly array of levers, bright and clean from constant use and careful\r\ntending, each one labelled for its respective duty. Before him to the\r\nright and left are the various electro-magnetic semaphores, each one in\r\nfull view and adjusted in position to the pair of roads to which it is\r\nappropriated, and all furnished with porcelain labels. Directly in front\r\nof him is a screen, along which are arranged the various semaphore keys;\r\nand on brackets, discreetly distributed, are the bells and gongs, the\r\ntwin companions each of its own semaphore. Before the screen are the\r\nwriting-desk and books, and here stands the youngster, the ministering\r\nspirit, all on the alert to take or to send electric signals and to\r\nrecord them, his time and attention being devoted alternately to his\r\nsemaphore keys and to his books, being immediately under the eye and\r\ncontrol of the signalman. This is no place for visitors, and the scenes\r\nenacted here have little chance of meeting the public gaze; indeed, the\r\nofficers whose duties take them hither occasionally are only too glad to\r\nlook on, and say as little as may be, and not interrupt the active pair,\r\nbetween whom there is evidently a good understanding in the discharge of\r\nduties upon the accurate performance of which so much depends. Looking\r\non, the man will be seen in command of his rank and file: signals come,\r\nare heard and seen by both man and boy; levers are drawn and withdrawn,\r\none, two, three, or more; the arms and the lamps on the gigantic masts\r\noutside, of which there are three, well laden, are displayed as\r\nrequired, distant signals are moved, points are shifted and roads made\r\nready; telegraph signals are acknowledged; and on looking out—for the\r\nbox is glazed throughout—trains are seen moving in accordance with the\r\nsignals made; and on the signal-posts at the boxes, right and left—for\r\nhere they are within easy reach of each other—arms are seen up and down\r\nin sympathy with those on the spot, and with the telegraph signals that\r\nhave been interchanged. There is no cessation to this work, and there is\r\nno confusion in it; one head and hand directs the whole, so that there\r\nare no conflicting interests and no misunderstandings; all is done in\r\nperfect tranquillity, and the great secret is that one thing is done at\r\na time. All this, which is so simple and so full of meaning to the\r\nexpert, is to the uninitiated intricate and vague; and though he cannot\r\nat first even follow the description of the several processes, so\r\nrapidly are they begun and ended, yet, as the cloud becomes thin, and\r\nhis ideas become clearer, he cannot fail to be gratified, and to be\r\nfilled with admiration at the great results that are brought about by\r\nmeans so simple.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 49.—_Post Office Railway Van._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMost of the carriages used on railways are so familiar to everyone that\r\nit is unnecessary to give any description of them. We give a figure of\r\none which, though of early type, has special features of interest, being\r\nthe well-designed Travelling Post Office, Fig. 49. In such vans as that\r\nhere represented letters are sorted during the journey, and for this\r\npurpose the interior is provided with a counter and with pigeon-holes\r\nfrom end to end. When the train stops bags may, of course, be removed\r\nfrom or received into the van in the ordinary manner; but by a simple\r\nmechanism bags may be delivered at a station and others taken up while\r\nthe train continues its journey at full speed. A bar can be made to\r\nproject from the side of the carriage, and on this the bag is hung by\r\nhooks, which are so contrived that they release the bag when a rod,\r\nprojecting from the receiving apparatus, strikes a certain catch on the\r\nvan. The bag then drops into a netting, which is spread for its\r\nreception; and in order to receive the bags taken up, a similar netting\r\nis stretched on an iron frame attached to the van This frame is made to\r\nfold up against the side of the carriage when not in use. When the train\r\nis approaching the station where the bag is to be taken up, this frame\r\nis let down, and a projecting portion detaches the bags, so that they\r\ndrop into the net, from which they are removed into the interior of the\r\nvehicle. These travelling post offices are lighted with gas, and are\r\npadded at the ends, so that the clerks may not be liable to injury by\r\nconcussions of the carriages.\r\n\r\nEngland has had to borrow from the United States not a few hints for\r\nsuch adaptations and appliances as tend to promote the comfort and\r\nconvenience of travellers by rail, especially on what we insularly call\r\nlong journeys. Some of these vehicles on the American railways are\r\nluxurious hotels upon wheels; they contain accommodation for forty\r\npersons, having a kitchen, hot and cold water, wine, china and linen\r\nclosets, and more than a hundred different articles of food, besides an\r\nample supply of tablecloths, table napkins, towels, sheets, pillowcases,\r\n&c. Then there are other Pullman inventions, such as the “palace” and\r\nthe “sleeping” cars, in which the traveller who is performing a long\r\njourney makes himself at home for days, or perhaps for a week, as, for\r\ninstance, while he is being carried across the American continent from\r\nocean to ocean at the easy rate of twenty miles an hour on the Pacific\r\nand other connecting lines. Mr. C. Nordhoff, an American writer, giving\r\nan account of his journey to the Western States, writes thus: “Having\r\nunpacked your books and unstrapped your wraps in your Pullman or Central\r\nPacific palace car, you may pursue all the sedentary avocations and\r\namusements of a parlour at home; and as your housekeeping is done—and\r\nadmirably done—for you by alert and experienced servants; as you may lie\r\ndown at full length, or sit up, sleep, or wake at your choice; as your\r\ndinner is sure to be abundant, very tolerably cooked, and not hurried;\r\nas you are pretty certain to make acquaintances in the car; and as the\r\ncountry through which you pass is strange and abounds in curious and\r\ninteresting sights, and the air is fresh and exhilarating—you soon fall\r\ninto the ways of the voyage; and if you are a tired business man or a\r\nwearied housekeeper, your careless ease will be such a rest as certainly\r\nmost busy and overworked Americans know how to enjoy. You write\r\ncomfortably at a table in a little room called a ‘drawing-room,’\r\nentirely closed off, if you wish it, from the remainder of the car,\r\nwhich room contains two large and comfortable armchairs and a sofa, two\r\nbroad clean plate-glass windows on each side (which may be doubled if\r\nthe weather is cold), hooks in abundance for shawls, hats, &c., and\r\nmirrors at every corner. Books and photographs lie on the table. Your\r\nwife sits at the window sewing and looking out on long ranges of\r\nsnow-clad mountains or on boundless ocean-like plains. Children play on\r\nthe floor or watch at the windows for the comical prairie dogs sitting\r\nnear their holes, and turning laughable somersaults as the car sweeps\r\nby. The porter calls you at any hour you appoint in the morning; he\r\ngives half an hour’s notice of breakfast, dinner, or supper; and while\r\nyou are at breakfast, your beds are made up and your room or your\r\nsection aired. About eight o’clock in the evening—for, as at sea, you\r\nkeep good hours—the porter, in a clean grey uniform, comes in to make up\r\nthe beds. The two easy-chairs are turned into a berth; the sofa\r\nundergoes a similar transformation; the table, having its legs pulled\r\ntogether, disappears in a corner, and two shelves being let down furnish\r\ntwo other berths. The freshest and whitest of linen and\r\nbrightly-coloured blankets complete the outfit; and you undress and go\r\nto bed as you would at home.”\r\n\r\nAn important general truth may find a familiar illustration in the\r\nsubject now under notice. The truth in question may be expressed by\r\nsaying that, in all human affairs, as well as in the operations of\r\nnature, the state of things at any one time is the result, by a sort of\r\ngrowth, of a preceding state of things. And in this way it is certainly\r\ntrue of inventions, that they never make their appearance suddenly in a\r\ncomplete and finished state—like Minerva, who is fabled to have sprung\r\nfrom the brain of Jupiter fully grown and completely armed; but rather\r\ntheir history resembles the slow and progressive process by which\r\nordinary mortals attain to their full stature. We have already seen that\r\nrailways had their origin in the tramways of collieries; and, in like\r\nmanner, the railway carriage grew out of the colliery truck and the\r\nstage coach; for when railway carriages to convey passengers were first\r\nmade, it did not occur to their designers that anything better could be\r\ndone than to place coach bodies on the frame of the truck; and\r\naccordingly the early railway carriages were formed by mounting the body\r\nof a stage coach, or two or three such bodies side by side, on the\r\ntimber framework which was supported by the flanged wheels. The cut,\r\nFig. 56, is from a painting in the possession of the Connecticut\r\nHistorical Society, and it represents the first railway train in America\r\non its trial trip (1831), in which sixteen persons took part, who were\r\nthen thought not a little courageous. Here we see that the carriages\r\nwere regular stage coaches, and the same was the case in England. But it\r\nis very significant that, to this day, the stage coach bodies are\r\ntraceable in many of the carriages now running on English lines,\r\nespecially in the first-class carriages, where, in the curved lines of\r\nthe mouldings which are supposed to ornament the outside, one may easily\r\nrecognize the forms of the curved bodies of the stage coaches, although\r\nthere is nothing whatever, in the real framing of the timbers of the\r\nrailway carriage, which has the most distant relation to these curves.\r\nThen again, almost universally on English lines, the old stage coach\r\ndoor-handles are still retained on the first-class carriages, in the\r\nawkward flat oval plates of brass which fold down with a hinge. Many\r\nother points might be named which would show the persistence of the\r\nstage coach type on the English railways. The cut, Fig. 56, proves that\r\nthe Americans set out with the same style of carriages; but North\r\nAmerica, as compared with the Old World, is _par excellence_ the country\r\nof rapid developments, and there carriages, or cars, as our\r\nTransatlantic cousins call them, have for a long time been made with\r\nnumerous improvements, and in forms more in harmony with the railway\r\nsystem, than the conservatism of English ideas, still cleaving to the\r\nstage coach type, permitted to be attempted in this country.\r\n\r\nRailway travellers in the United States had long enjoyed the benefit of\r\ncomforts and convenience in the appointments of their carriages long\r\nbefore any change had been effected in the general arrangements of the\r\nvehicles provided by the railway companies in England. It is now indeed\r\na considerable number of years since this state of things has been\r\naltered in the older country; as all the great lines, following the\r\nexample of the Midland Company, who first adopted the Pullman cars, have\r\nconstructed luxurious vehicles in which every elegance and comfort are\r\nplaced within the reach of the English traveller, and these improvements\r\nare highly appreciated by all who have long journeys to make by day or\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe elegance and comfort of the arrangements are almost too obvious to\r\nrequire description. We see the luxuriously padded chairs, which, by\r\nturning on swivels, permit the traveller to adjust his position\r\naccording to his individual wishes, so that he can, with ease, place his\r\nseat either to gaze directly on the passing landscape, or turn his face\r\ntowards his fellow-travellers opposite or on either side. The chairs are\r\nalso provided with an arrangement for placing the backs at any required\r\ninclination, and the light and refined character of the decorations of\r\nthe carriage should not escape the reader’s notice. Pullman Cars of\r\nanother kind, providing sleeping accommodation for night journeys, are\r\nalso in use on the Midland line, and they are fitted up with the same\r\nthoughtful regard to comfort as the Parlour Car.\r\n\r\nThe great engineering feats which have been accomplished in the\r\nconstruction of railways are numerous enough to fill volumes. We give,\r\ntherefore, only a short notice of one or two recently constructed lines\r\nwhich have features of special interest, concluding with a brief account\r\nof such remarkable constructions as the railway by which the traveller\r\nmay now go up the Rigi, and the railways which ascend Vesuvius and Mt.\r\nPilatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _THE METROPOLITAN RAILWAYS._\r\n\r\nWhen the traffic in the streets of London became so great that the\r\nordinary thoroughfares were unable to meet public requirements, the bold\r\nproject was conceived of making a railway under the streets. The\r\nconstruction of a line of railway beneath the streets of a populous\r\ncity, amidst a labyrinth of gas-pipes, water-mains, sewers, &c., is\r\nobviously an undertaking presenting features so remarkable that the\r\nLondon Underground Railway cannot here be passed over without a short\r\nnotice. Its construction occupied about three years, and it was opened\r\nfor traffic in 1863. The line commencing at Paddington, and passing\r\nbeneath Edgware Road at right angles, reaches Marylebone Road, under the\r\ncentre of which it proceeds, and passing beneath the houses at one end\r\nof Park Crescent, Portland Place, it follows the centre of Euston Road\r\nto King’s Cross, where connection with the Great Northern and Midland\r\nsystem is effected. Here the line bends sharply southwards, and proceeds\r\nto Farringdon Street Station, the original terminus. A subsequent\r\nextension takes an easterly direction and reaches Aldgate Station, the\r\nnominal terminus. The crown of the arch which covers the line is in some\r\nplaces only a few inches beneath the level of the streets; in other\r\nplaces it is several feet below the surface, and, in fact, beneath the\r\nfoundations of the houses and other buildings. The steepest gradient on\r\nthe line is 1 in 100, and the sharpest curve has a radius of 200 yards.\r\nThe line is nearly all curved, there not being in all its length\r\nthree-quarters of a mile of straight rails. The difficulties besetting\r\nan undertaking of this kind would be tedious to describe, but may\r\nreadily be imagined. The line traverses every kind of soil—clay, gravel,\r\nsand, rubbish, all loosened by previous excavations for drains, pipes,\r\nfoundations, &c.; and the arrangements of these drains, water and\r\ngas-pipes, had to be reconciled with the progress of the railway works,\r\nwithout their uses being interfered with even for a time. Of the\r\nstations the majority have roofs of the ordinary kind, open to the sky;\r\nbut two of them, namely, Baker Street and Gower Street, are completely\r\nunderground stations, and their roofs are formed by the arches of\r\nbrickwork immediately below the streets. The arrangements at these\r\nstations show great boldness and inventiveness of design. The booking\r\noffices for the up line are on one side of the road, and those for the\r\ndown line on the other. Fig. 50 represents the interior of the Gower\r\nStreet Station, and the other is very similar. In each the platforms are\r\n325 ft. long and 10 ft. broad, and the stations are lighted by lateral\r\nopenings through the springing of the arch which forms the roof. This\r\narch is a portion of a circle of 32 ft. radius, with a span of 45 ft.\r\nand a rise of 9 ft. at the crown. The lateral openings are arched at the\r\ntop and bottom, but the sides are flat. The width of each is 4 ft. 9\r\nin., and the height outside 6 ft., increasing to 10 ft. at the ends\r\nopening on the platform. The openings are entirely lined with white\r\nglazed tiles, and the outward ends open into an area, the back of which\r\nis inclined at an angle of 45°, and the whole also lined with white\r\nglazed tiles, and covered with glass, except where some iron gratings\r\nare provided for ventilation. The tiles reflect the daylight so\r\npowerfully that but little gas is required for the illumination of the\r\nstation in the day-time. The arched roofs of these stations are\r\nsupported by piers of brickwork, 10 ft. apart, 5 ft. 6 in. deep, and 3\r\nft. 9 in. wide. In the spaces between the piers vertical arches, like\r\nparts of the brick lining of a well, are wedged in, to resist the thrust\r\nof the earth, and a straight wall is built inside of this between the\r\npiers, to form the platform wall of the station. The tops of the piers\r\nare connected by arches, and are thus made to bear the weight of the\r\narched roof, which has 2 ft. 3 in. thickness of brickwork at the crown,\r\nand a much greater thickness towards the haunches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 50.—_Gower Street Station, Metropolitan Railway._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe benefit derived by the public from the completion of the\r\nMetropolitan Railway was greatly increased by the subsequent\r\nconstruction of another railway—“The Metropolitan District,” which,\r\njoining the Metropolitan at Paddington, makes a circuit about the\r\nwest-end of Hyde Park, and passing close to the Victoria Terminus of the\r\nLondon, Chatham, and Dover and the Brighton and South Coast Railways,\r\nreaches Westminster Bridge, and then follows the Thames Embankment to\r\nBlackfriars Bridge, where it leaves the bank of the river for the\r\nMansion House, Mark Lane and Aldgate stations. This line, taken in\r\nconjunction with the Metropolitan, forms the “_inner circle_” of the\r\nrailway communication in London. The circuit was for a long time\r\nincomplete at the east by the want of connection between the Mansion\r\nHouse Station and that of Moorgate Street, although these stations are\r\nbut little more than half a mile apart. A line connecting these two\r\npoints has lately been constructed at great cost, and the public now\r\npossess a complete circle of communication. The number of trains each\r\nday entering and leaving some of the stations on the Metropolitan system\r\nis very great. Moorgate Street Station—a terminus into which several\r\ncompanies run—may have about 800 trains arriving or departing in the\r\ncourse of a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _THE PACIFIC RAILWAY._\r\n\r\nThe remarkable development of railways which has taken place in the\r\nUnited States has its most striking illustration in the great system of\r\nlines by which the whole continent can be traversed from shore to shore.\r\nThe distance by rail from New York to San Francisco is 3,215 miles, and\r\nthe journey occupies about a week, the trains travelling night and day.\r\nThe traveller proceeding from the Eastern States to the far west has the\r\nchoice of many routes, but these all converge to Omaha. From this point\r\nthe Pacific Railroad will convey him towards the land of the setting\r\nsun. The map, Fig. 51, shows the course of this railway, which is the\r\nlongest in the world. It traverses broader plains and crosses higher\r\nmountains than any other. Engineering skill of the most admirable kind\r\nhas been displayed in the laying-out and in the construction of the\r\nline, with its innumerable cuttings, bridges, tunnels, and snow-sheds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 51.—_Map of the Route of the Pacific Railway._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe road from Omaha to Ogden, near the Great Salt Lake—a distance of\r\n1,032 miles—is owned by the Union Pacific Company, and the Central\r\nPacific joins the former at Ogden and completes the communication to San\r\nFrancisco, a further length of 889 miles—the whole distance from Omaha\r\nto San Francisco being 1,911 miles. The Union Pacific was commenced in\r\nNovember, 1865, and completed in May, 1869. There are at Omaha extensive\r\nworkshops provided with all the appliances for constructing and\r\nrepairing locomotives and carriages, and these works cover 30 acres of\r\nground, and give employment to several thousand men. The population of\r\nOmaha rose during the making of the railway from under 3,000 in 1864 to\r\nmore than 16,000 in 1870, and it is now a flourishing town. A little\r\ndistance from Omaha the line approaches the Platte River, and the valley\r\nof this river and one of its tributaries is ascended to Cheyenne, 516\r\nmiles from Omaha, the line being nowhere very far from the river’s\r\ncourse. Cheyenne is 5,075 ft. higher above the sea than Omaha, the\r\nelevation of which is 966 ft. The Platte River is a broad but very\r\nshallow stream, with a channel continually shifting, owing to the vast\r\nquantity of sand which its muddy waters carry down. This portion of the\r\nline passing through a district where leagues upon leagues of fertile\r\nland await the hand of the tiller, has opened up vast tracts of\r\nland—hedgeless, gateless green fields, free to all, and capable of\r\nreceiving and supporting millions of human inhabitants. Cheyenne, a town\r\nof 3,000 inhabitants, is entirely the creation of the railways, for\r\nsouthward from Cheyenne a railway passes to Denver, a distance of 106\r\nmiles, through rich farming and grazing districts. Seven miles beyond\r\nCheyenne the line begins to ascend the Black Hills by steep gradients,\r\nand at Granite Canyon, for example, the rise in five miles is 574 ft.,\r\nor about 121 ft. per mile. Many lime-kilns have been erected in this\r\nneighbourhood, where limestone is very abundant. A little beyond this\r\npoint the road is in many places protected by snow-sheds, fences of\r\ntimber, and rude stonework. At Sherman, 549 miles from Omaha, the line\r\nattains the summit of its track over the Black Hills, and the highest\r\npoint on any railway in the world, being 8,242 ft. above the level of\r\nthe sea. Wild and desolate scenery characterizes the district round\r\nSherman, and the hills, in places covered with a dense growth of wood,\r\nwill furnish an immense supply of timber for years to come. The\r\ntimber-sheds erected over the line, and the fences beside it are not so\r\nmuch on account of the depth of snow that falls, but to prevent it from\r\nblocking the line by being drifted into the cuts by the high wind. A few\r\nmiles beyond Dale Creek at Sherman is the largest bridge on the line. It\r\nis a trestle bridge, 650 ft. long and 126 ft. high, and has a very light\r\nappearance—indeed, to an English eye unaccustomed to these _impromptu_\r\ntimber structures, it looks unpleasantly light. From Sherman the line\r\ndescends to Laramie, which is 7,123 ft. above the sea level and 24 miles\r\nfrom Sherman, and here the railway has a workshop, for good coal is\r\nfound within a few miles. A fine tract of grazing land, 60 miles long\r\nand 20 miles broad, stretches around this station, and it is said that\r\nnowhere in the whole North American continent can cattle be reared and\r\nfattened more cheaply. The line, now descending the Black Hills, crosses\r\nfor many miles a long stretch of rolling prairie, covered in great part\r\nwith sage-bush, and forming a tableland lying between the western base\r\nof the Black Hills and the eastern base of the snowy range of the Rocky\r\nMountains, which latter reach an elevation of from 10,000 to 17,000 ft.\r\nabove the sea level and are perpetually covered with snow. Such\r\ntablelands are termed in America “parks.” Before the line reaches the\r\nsummit of the pass by which it crosses the range of the snowy mountains,\r\nit traverses some rough country among the spurs of the hills—through\r\ndeep cuts and under snow-sheds, across ravines and rivers, and through\r\ntunnels. At Percy, 669 miles, is a station named after Colonel Percy,\r\nwho was killed here by the Indians when surveying for the line. He was\r\nsurprised by a party of the red men, and retreated to a cabin, where he\r\nwithstood the attack of his assailants for three days, killing several\r\nof them; but at length they set fire to the cabin, and the unfortunate\r\nColonel rushing out, fell a victim to their ferocity. Near Creston, 737\r\nmiles from Omaha, the highest point of the chief range is reached,\r\nthough at an elevation lower by 1,212 ft. than the summit of the pass\r\nwhere the line crosses the Black Hills, which are the advanced guard of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. Here is the water-shed of the continent, for all\r\nstreams rising to the east of this flow ultimately into the\r\nAtlantic,—while these, having their sources in the west, fall into the\r\nPacific. Before reaching Ogden the line passes through some grand\r\ngorges, which open a way for the iron horse through the very hearts of\r\nthe mountains, as if Nature had foreseen railways and providently formed\r\ngigantic cuttings—such as the Echo and Weber Canyons, which enable the\r\nline to traverse the Wahsatch Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 52.—_Trestle Bridge._\r\n]\r\n\r\nEcho Canyon is a ravine 7 miles long, about half a mile broad, flanked\r\nby precipitous cliffs, from 300 to 800 ft. high, and presenting a\r\nsuccession of wild and grand scenery. In Weber Canyon the river foams\r\nand rushes along between the mountains, which rise in massive grandeur\r\non either side, plunging and eddying among the huge masses of rock\r\nfallen from the cliffs above. Along a part of the chasm the railway is\r\ncut in the side of the steep mountain, descending directly to the bed of\r\nthe stream. Where the road could not be carried round or over the spurs\r\nof the mountains it passes through tunnels, often cut through solid\r\nstone. A few miles farther the line reaches the city of Ogden, in the\r\nstate of Utah, the territory of the Mormons. This territory contains\r\nupwards of 65,000 square miles, and though the land is not naturally\r\nproductive, it has, by irrigation, been brought into a high state of\r\ncultivation, and it abounds in valuable minerals, so that it now\r\nsupports a population of 80,000 persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 53.—_American Canyon._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at Ogden, where the western portion of the great\r\nrailway line connecting the two oceans unites to the Union Pacific we\r\nhave just described. This western portion is known as the Central\r\nPacific Railroad, and it stretches from Ogden to San Francisco, a\r\ndistance of 882 miles.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the line which unites Sacramento to Ogden, 743 miles, was\r\ncommenced in 1863 and finished in 1869, but nearly half of the entire\r\nlength was constructed in 1868, and about 50 miles west of Ogden, the\r\nremarkable engineering feat of laying 10 miles of railway in one day was\r\nperformed. It was thus accomplished: when the waggon loaded with the\r\nrails arrived at the end of the track, the two outer rails were seized,\r\nhauled forward off the car, and laid upon the sleepers by four men, who\r\nattended to this duty only. The waggon was pushed forwards over these\r\nrails, and the process of putting down the rails was repeated, while\r\nbehind the waggon came a little army of men, who drove in the spikes and\r\nscrewed on the fish-plates, and, lastly, a large number of Chinese\r\nworkmen, with pickaxes and spades, who ballasted the line. The average\r\nrate at which these operations proceeded was about 240 ft. of track in\r\n77½ seconds, and in these 10 miles of railway there were 2,585,000\r\ncross-ties, 3,520 iron rails, 55,000 spikes, 7,040 fish-plates, and\r\n14,080 bolts with screws, the whole weighing 4,362,000 lbs.! Four\r\nthousand men and hundreds of waggons were required, but in the 10 miles\r\nall the rails were laid by the same eight men, each of whom is said to\r\nhave that day walked 10 miles and lifted 1,000 tons of iron rails.\r\nNothing but the practice acquired during the four previous years and the\r\nmost excellent arrangement and discipline could have made the\r\nperformance of such a feat possible as the laying of eight miles of the\r\ntrack in six hours, which was the victory achieved by these stalwart\r\nnavvies before dinner.\r\n\r\nThe line crosses the great American desert, distinguished for its\r\ndesolate aspect and barren soil, and so thickly strewn with alkaline\r\ndust that it appears almost like a snow-covered plain. The alkali is\r\ncaustic, and where it abounds no vegetation can exist, most of the\r\nsurface of this waste being fine, hard grey sand, mixed with the\r\nfragments of marine shells and beds of alkali.\r\n\r\nThe third great mountain range of the North American continent is\r\ncrossed by this line, at an elevation of 7,043 ft. above the sea level.\r\nThe Sierra Nevada, as the name implies, is a range of rugged wild broken\r\nmountain-tops, always covered with snow. The more exposed portions of\r\nthe road are covered with snow-sheds, solidly constructed of pine wood\r\nposts, 16 in. or 20 in. across: the total length of snow-sheds on the\r\nSierra Nevada may equal 50 miles. These sheds sometimes take fire; but\r\nthe company have a locomotive at the Summit Station, ready to start at a\r\nmoment’s notice with cars carrying tanks of water. The snow falls there\r\nsometimes to a depth of 20 ft. in one winter; and in spring, when it\r\nfalls into the valleys in avalanches, sweeping down the mountain-sides,\r\nthey pass harmlessly over the sloping roofs of the snow-sheds. Where the\r\nline passes along the steep flank of a mountain, the roofs of these\r\nsnow-sheds abut against the mountain-side, so that the masses of snow,\r\ngliding down from its heights, continue their slide without injury to\r\nline, or sheds, or trains. Where, however, the line lies on level\r\nground, or in a ridge, the snow-sheds are built with a strong roof of\r\ndouble slope, in order to support or throw off the snow. From Summit\r\n(7,017 ft.) the line descends continuously to Sacramento, which is only\r\n30 ft. above the sea level, and 104 miles from Summit. About 36 miles\r\nfrom Summit, the great American Canyon, one of the wildest gorges in the\r\nSierra Nevada range, is passed. Here the American River is confined for\r\na length of two miles between precipitous walls of rock, 2,000 ft. in\r\nheight, and so steep that no human foot has ever yet followed the stream\r\nthrough this tremendous gorge (Fig. 53). A few miles beyond this the\r\nline is carried, by a daring feat of engineering, along the side of a\r\nmountain, overhanging a stream 2,500 ft. below. This mountain is known\r\nas “Cape Horn,” and is a place to try the nerves of timid people. When\r\nthis portion of the line was commenced, the workmen were lowered and\r\nheld by ropes, until they had hewn out a standing-place on the shelving\r\nsides of the precipice, along whose dizzy height, where even the agile\r\nIndian was unable to plant his foot, the science of the white man thus\r\nmade for his iron horse a secure and direct road. (Fig. 54.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 54.—“_Cape Horn._”\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 55.—_Snow Plough._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese lines of railway, connecting Omaha with Sacramento, are remarkable\r\nevidences of the energy and spirit which characterize the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace in America. The men who conceived the design of the Central Pacific\r\nRailroad, and actually carried it into effect, were not persons\r\nexperienced in railway construction; but five middle-aged traders of\r\nSacramento, two of whom where drapers, one a wholesale grocer, and the\r\nothers ironmongers, believing that such a railway should be made, and\r\nfinding no one ready to undertake it, united together, projected the\r\nrailway, got it completed, and now manage it. These gentlemen were\r\nassociated with an engineer named Judah, who was a sanguine advocate of\r\nthe scheme, and made the preliminary surveys, if he did not plan the\r\nline. The line is considered one of the best appointed and best managed\r\nin the States; yet the project was at first ridiculed and pronounced\r\nimpracticable by engineers of high repute, opposed by capitalists, and\r\ndenounced by politicians. An eminent banker, who personally regarded the\r\nscheme with hopefulness, would not venture, however, to take any stock,\r\nlest the credit of his bank should be shaken, were he known to be\r\nconnected with so wild a scheme. And, indeed, the difficulties appeared\r\ngreat. Except wood, all the materials required, the iron rails, the\r\npickaxes and spades, the waggons, the locomotives, and the machinery had\r\nto be sent by sea from New York, round Cape Horn, a long and perilous\r\nvoyage of nine months duration, and transhipped at San Francisco for\r\nanother voyage of 120 miles before they could reach Sacramento. Add to\r\nthis that workmen were so scarce in California, and wages so high, that\r\nto carry on the work it was necessary to obtain men from New York; and\r\nduring its progress 10,000 Chinamen were brought across the Pacific, to\r\nwork as labourers. Subscriptions came in very slowly, and before 30\r\nmiles of the line had been constructed, the price of iron rose in a very\r\nshort time to nearly three times its former amount. At this critical\r\njuncture, the five merchants decided to defray, out of their own private\r\nfortunes, the cost of keeping 800 men at work on the line for a whole\r\nyear. We cannot but admire the unswerving confidence in their enterprise\r\ndisplayed by these five country merchants, unskilled in railway making,\r\nunaided by public support, and even discouraged in their project by\r\ntheir own friends. The financial and legal obstacles they successfully\r\nsurmounted were not the only difficulties to be overcome. They had the\r\nengineering difficulties of carrying their line over the steep Sierra, a\r\nwork of four years; long tunnels had to be bored; one spring when snow\r\n60 ft. in depth covered the track, it had to be removed by the shovel\r\nfor 7 miles along the road; saw-mills had to be erected in the\r\nmountains, to prepare the sleepers and other timber work; wood and water\r\nhad to be carried 40 miles across alkali plains, and locomotives and\r\nrails dragged over the mountains by teams of oxen. The chief engineer,\r\nwho organized the force of labourers, laid out the road, designed the\r\nnecessary structures, and successfully grappled with the novel problem\r\nof running trains over such a line in all seasons, was Mr. S. S.\r\nMontague. The requirements of the traffic necessitate not only solidly\r\nconstructed iron-covered snow-sheds, but massive snow-ploughs to throw\r\noff the track the deep snow which could in no other way be prevented\r\nfrom interrupting the working of the line. These snow-ploughs are\r\nsometimes urged forward with the united power of eight heavy\r\nlocomotives. Fig. 55 represents one of these ploughs cleaning the line,\r\nby throwing off the snow on to the sides of the track. The cutting\r\napparatus varies in its arrangements, some forms being designed to push\r\nthe snow off on one side, some on the other, and to fling it down the\r\nprecipices; and others, like the one represented, are intended merely to\r\nthrow it off the track.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 56.—_The first Steam Railroad Train in America._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSacramento is 1,775 miles from Omaha, and is connected with San\r\nFrancisco by a line 139 miles long. At San Francisco, or rather at\r\nOakland, 1,911 miles from Omaha and 3,212 miles from New York, is the\r\nterminus of the great system of lines connecting the opposite shores of\r\nthe vast North American continent. San Francisco, situated on the\r\nwestern shore of a bay, is connected with Oakland by a ferry; but the\r\nrailway company have recently constructed a pier, which carries the\r\ntrains out into the bay for 2¼ miles. This pier is strongly built, and\r\nis provided with a double set of rails and a carriage-road, and with\r\nslips at which ships land and embark passengers, so that ships trading\r\nto China, Japan, and Australia can load and unload directly into the\r\ntrains, which may pass without change from the shores of the Pacific to\r\nthose of the Atlantic Ocean. San Francisco is a marvellous example of\r\nrapid increase, for the population now numbers 170,000, yet a quarter of\r\na century ago 500 white settlers could not be found in as many miles\r\naround its site. The first house was erected in 1846, and in 1847 not a\r\nship visited the bay, but now forty large steamships ply regularly,\r\ncarrying mails to China, Japan, Panama, South America, Australia, &c.,\r\nand there are, of course, hundreds of other steamers and ships.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions we have given of only two lines of railway may suffice\r\nto show that the modern engineer is deterred by no obstacles, but boldly\r\ndrives his lines through places apparently the most impracticable. He\r\nshrinks from no operations however difficult, nor hesitates to undertake\r\nworks the mere magnitude of which would have made our forefathers stand\r\naghast. Not in England or America alone, but in almost every part of the\r\nworld, the railways have extended with wonderful rapidity; the continent\r\nof Europe is embraced by a network of lines; the distant colonies of\r\nAustralia and New Zealand have thousands of miles of lines laid down,\r\nand many more in progress; the map of India shows that peninsula\r\ntraversed in all directions by the iron roads; and in the far distant\r\nEast we hear of Japan having several lines in successful operation, and\r\nthe design of laying down more. In connection with such works, at home\r\nand abroad, many constructions of great size and daring have been\r\ndesigned and erected; many navigable rivers have been bridged, and not\r\nseldom has an arm of the sea itself been spanned; hundreds of miles of\r\nembankments and viaducts have been raised; hills have been pierced with\r\ninnumerable cuttings and tunnels, and all these great works have been\r\naccomplished within the experience of a single generation of men, and\r\nhave sprung from one single successful achievement of Stephenson’s—the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway, completed and opened in 1830. We in\r\nEngland should also have pride in remembering that the growth of the\r\nrailways here is due to the enterprise, industry, and energy of private\r\npersons; for the State has furnished no funds, but individuals, by\r\ncombining their own resources, have executed the works, and manage the\r\nlines for their common interest and the public good. It is said that the\r\namount of money which has been spent on railways in Great Britain is not\r\nfar short of 500 millions of pounds sterling. The greatest railway\r\ncompany in the United Kingdom is the London and North-Western, which\r\ndraws in annual receipts about seven millions of pounds; and the total\r\nreceipts of all the railway companies would nearly equal half the\r\nrevenue of the State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 57.—_Railway Embankment near Bath._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE VI.\r\n\r\n  MOUNT WASHINGTON INCLINED TRACK.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _INCLINED RAILWAYS._\r\n\r\nThe construction of railways over lofty ranges of mountains will be\r\nfound illustrated by the brief notices in other pages of the Union\r\nPacific line in the United States, and of the St. Gothard railway over\r\nthe Alps. In such cases, the track has been to a great extent carried\r\nover the spurs or along the sides of the mountains, so that such\r\ninclines might be obtained as the ordinary locomotive was capable of\r\nascending. The expensive operation of tunnelling was resorted to only\r\nwhere sinuous deviations from the more direct route involved a still\r\ngreater expenditure of initial cost, or a continual waste of time and\r\nenergy in the actual working of the line. Sometimes winding tracks,\r\nalmost returning by snake-like loops on their own route, as projected on\r\nthe map, were required in order that the ascent could be made with an\r\nincline practicable for the ordinary locomotive. In the earlier\r\ndevelopment of railways, there were to be met with cable inclines, where\r\nthe traction of the locomotive had to be superseded or supplemented by\r\nthat of a rope or chain wound round a drum actuated by a stationary\r\nsteam-engine. The more powerful locomotives of the present day are able\r\nto mount grades of such inclination that the employment of cable\r\ntraction is no longer requisite, except in but a few cases. Railways had\r\ncarried passengers about in all parts of the world for many years before\r\nthe engineer addressed himself to the problem of easily and quickly\r\ntaking people up heights of steep and toilsome ascent, sought generally\r\nfor the sake of the prospect, etc. Such, at least, has been the object\r\nof most of the inclined railways already constructed, but to this their\r\nutility is by no means limited, and as their safety and stability has\r\nbeen proved by many years of use, they may find wider applications than\r\nthe gratification of the tourist and pleasure-seeker.\r\n\r\nThe toothed rail or rack which was formerly supposed necessary to obtain\r\npower of traction on rails has been already mentioned (p. 101), and as\r\nearly as 1812 such a contrivance appears to have been in use in England,\r\nnear Leeds, the invention of a Mr. Blenkinsop. This mode of traction\r\nreceived no development or improvement worthy of notice until Mr. S.\r\nMarsh constructed, in 1866, a railway ladder—for so it may be called—for\r\nthe ascent of Mount Washington in the United States. In this case there\r\nwas a centre rail formed of iron, angle iron laid between and parallel\r\nto the metals on which ran the wheels of the carriages. In this centre\r\nrail angle irons were connected by round bars of wrought iron, which the\r\nteeth of a pinion of the locomotive engaged, so that a climbing action,\r\nresembling somewhat that of a wheel entering on the successive rounds of\r\na ladder, was produced, and in this way an ascensive power was obtained\r\nsufficient to overcome gravity, the gradient not much exceeding a rise\r\nof one foot in three at any point (12 vertical to 32 horizontal). This\r\nrailway was completed in 1869, and for more than a quarter of a century\r\nit has carried thousands of tourists to the summit of Mount Washington\r\nwithout a single fatal accident. This system of ascending mountains was\r\nsoon adopted in Europe with certain improvements, for in 1870 an\r\ninclined railway was constructed to the summit of the Rigi, in which a\r\nsystem of involute gearing was substituted for the ladder-like rounds of\r\nMr. Marsh. A certain vibratory action, due to the successive engagements\r\nof the teeth in the central rack, which was somewhat disagreeable for\r\npassengers, was soon afterwards obviated in the Abt system, in which two\r\nracks are used, with the teeth of one opposite the spaces of the other,\r\nand a double pinion provided, so that greater uniformity in the acting\r\npower is obtained. With certain modifications in detail, such as\r\nhorizontal instead of vertical pinions, this system has been largely\r\nadopted wherever cables have been dispensed with. In the inclined\r\nrailway by which Mount Pilatus, near Lucerne, is now ascended,\r\nhorizontal teeth project from both sides of a centre rail, and these are\r\nengaged by horizontal pinions. The incline here is very steep, being in\r\nplaces nearly 30 degrees; teeth perpendicular to the plane of the\r\nincline would have offered a less margin of safety than those on the\r\nplan actually adopted. In some places, as among the Alps, and more\r\nparticularly in South America, there are railways in which the ordinary\r\nmode of traction and that with the rack are combined; that is, where the\r\ngradient exceeds the ordinary limit, a central rack-rail is laid down,\r\non approaching which the engineer slackens his speed, and allows\r\npinions, moved by the locomotive, to become engaged in the double rack,\r\nby which he slowly climbs the steep ascent until a level tract is\r\nreached which permits of the ordinary traction being resumed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 57_a_.—_Train Ascending the Rigi._\r\n]\r\n\r\nInstead of climbing the inclines by rack-work rails, there is another\r\nsystem which offers great advantages for economy in working, and one\r\ngenerally resorted to where the incline can be made in one vertical\r\nplane. This is the balanced cable, in which the gravitation force of a\r\ndescending car or train is utilised to draw up, or assist to draw up,\r\nthe ascending car or train. These cars are attached to the ends of a\r\ncable which passes round a drum at the top of the incline, and means are\r\nprovided, according to circumstances, so that the drum may be turned, or\r\nits revolutions controlled by brakes. When there is a water supply at\r\nthe upper end of the incline, a simple and economical mode of working\r\nthe cable is available; for all that is necessary is to provide each car\r\nwith a water-tank capable of being rapidly filled and emptied. The upper\r\ncar is made the heavier when required, by filling its tank with water,\r\nwhen it raises the lower car, and on itself arriving at the bottom, the\r\nwater is discharged before the load to be taken up is received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 57_b_.—_At the Summit of the Rigi._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany inclined railways are now in operation in various parts of the\r\nworld, as at Mount Vesuvius, where two of the slopes have a combined\r\nlength of 10,500 feet; at Mount Supurga and at Mount San Salvatore there\r\nare others. At Burgen-stock in Switzerland there is one having a slope\r\n57 feet vertical to 100 feet horizontal. These are cable inclines; but a\r\nrack is also used with a pinion regulated by a friction-brake to avoid\r\naccident, in case of the cable parting. The largest inclined railway in\r\nAmerica is at the Catskill Mountains, where an ascent of 1,600 feet is\r\nmade in a horizontal distance of 6,780 feet. In this a novel plan has\r\nbeen adopted for compensating the varying weight that has to be moved,\r\nfor it is obvious that at the commencement the load at the top of the\r\nincline has to raise not only that at the bottom, but the whole weight\r\nof the cable also, equal to 35,000 pounds of wire rope, and again after\r\nthe middle point has been passed, the descending power is constantly\r\nincreasing, while the load being raised is diminishing. Now, in order\r\nthat the engine may work with more uniform effect, the engineer has not\r\nmade the incline a straight line, but with the slope lightest at the\r\nbottom and gradually increased towards the top, so that the line is\r\nreally a curve in the vertical plane, and has at every point just the\r\ninclination required for balancing the weight of the wire cable, as this\r\nshifts from the one track to the other. Instead of a rack pinion and\r\nbrake to control a too rapid descent from any accident, the cars are\r\nprovided with clutches, which are automatically thrown out on wooden\r\nguard-rails, when a safe speed is exceeded. Inclined railways have also\r\nbeen constructed to the summit of Snowdon, in North Wales, and to that\r\nof the Jungfrau, in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE VII.\r\n\r\n  PIKE’S PEAK RAILWAY, ROCKY MOUNTAINS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.—_The Great Eastern at Anchor._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           STEAM NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first practically successful steamboat was constructed by Symington,\r\nand used on the Forth and Clyde Canal in 1802. A few years afterwards\r\nFulton established steam navigation in American waters, where a number\r\nof steamboats plied regularly for some years before the invention had\r\nreceived a corresponding development in England, for it was not until\r\n1814 that a steam-packet ran for hire in the Thames. From that time,\r\nhowever, the principle was quickly and extensively applied, and steamers\r\nmade their appearance on the chief rivers of Great Britain, and soon\r\nbegan also to make regular passages from one sea-port to another, until\r\nat length, in 1819, a steamer made the voyage from New York to\r\nLiverpool. It does not appear, however, that such ocean steam voyages\r\nbecame at once common, for we read that in 1825 the captain of the first\r\nsteam-ship which made the voyage to India was rewarded by a large sum of\r\nmoney. It was not until 1838 that regular steam communication with\r\nAmerica was commenced by the dispatch of the _Great Western_ from\r\nBristol. Other large steamers were soon built expressly for the passage\r\nof the Atlantic, and a new era in steam navigation was reached when, in\r\n1845, the _Great Britain_ made her first voyage to New York in fourteen\r\ndays. This ship was of immense size, compared with her predecessors, her\r\nlength being 320 ft., and she was moreover made of iron, while instead\r\nof paddles, she was provided with a screw-propeller, both circumstances\r\nat that time novelties in passenger ships. Fulton appears to have made\r\ntrial in America of various forms of mechanism for propelling ships\r\nthrough the water. Among other plans he tried the screw, but finally\r\ndecided in favour of paddle-wheels, and for a long time these were\r\nuniversally adopted. Many ships of war were built with paddle-wheels,\r\nbut the advantages of the screw-propeller were at length perceived. The\r\npaddle-wheels could easily be disabled by an enemy’s shot, and the large\r\npaddle-boxes encumbered the decks and obstructed the operations of naval\r\nwarfare. Another circumstance perhaps had a greater share in the general\r\nadoption of the screw, which had long before been proposed as a means of\r\napplying steam power to the propulsion of vessels. This was the\r\nintroduction of a new method of placing the screw, so that its powers\r\nwere used to greater advantage. Mr. J. P. Smith obtained a patent in\r\n1836 for placing the propeller in that part of the vessel technically\r\ncalled the _dead-wood_, which is above the keel and immediately in front\r\nof the rudder. When the means of propulsion in a ship of war is so\r\nplaced, this vital part is secure from injury by hostile projectiles,\r\nand the decks are clear for training guns and other operations. Thus\r\nplaced, the screw has been proved to possess many advantages over\r\npaddle-wheels, so that at the present time it has largely superseded\r\npaddle-wheels in vessels of every class, except perhaps in those\r\nintended to ply on rivers and lakes. Many fine paddle-wheel vessels are\r\nstill afloat, but sea-going steamers are nearly always now built with\r\nscrew-propellers. In the application of the steam engine to navigation\r\nthe machine has received many modifications in the form and arrangement\r\nof the parts, but in principle the marine engine is identical with the\r\ncondensing engine already described. The engines in steam-ships are\r\noften remarkable for the great diameter given to the cylinders, which\r\nmay be 8 ft. or 9 ft. or more. Of course other parts of the machinery\r\nare of corresponding dimensions. Such large cylinders require the\r\nexercise of great skill in their construction, for they must be cast in\r\none piece and without flaws. The engraving, Fig. 59, depicts the scene\r\npresented at the works of Messrs. Penn during the casting of one of\r\nthese large cylinders, the weight of which may amount to perhaps 30\r\ntons. Only the top of the mould is visible, and the molten iron is being\r\npoured in from huge ladles, moved by powerful cranes. In paddle vessels\r\nthe great wrought iron shaft which carries the paddle-wheels crosses the\r\nvessel from side to side. This shaft has two cranks, placed at right\r\nangles to each, and each one is turned by an engine, which is very\r\ncommonly of the kind known as the side-lever engine. In this engine,\r\ninstead of a beam being placed above the cylinder, two beams are used,\r\none being set on each side of the cylinder, as low down as possible. The\r\ntop of the piston-rod is attached to a crosshead, from each end of which\r\nhangs a great rod, which is hinged to the end of the side-beam. The\r\nother ends of the two beams are united by a cross-bar, to which is\r\nattached the connecting-rod that gives motion to the crank. Another\r\nfavourite form of engine for steam-ships is that with oscillating\r\ncylinders. The paddle-wheels are constructed with an iron framework, to\r\nwhich flat boards, or floats, are attached, placed usually in a radial\r\ndirection. But when thus fixed, each float enters the water obliquely,\r\nand in fact its surface is perpendicular to the direction of the\r\nvessel’s course only at the instant the float is vertically under the\r\naxis of the wheel. In order to avoid the loss of power consequent upon\r\nthis oblique movement of the floats, they are sometimes hung upon\r\ncentres, and are so moved by suitable mechanism that they are always in\r\na nearly vertical position when passing through the water. Paddle-wheels\r\nconstructed in this manner are termed _feathering_ wheels. They do not\r\nappear, however, to possess any great advantage over those of the\r\nordinary construction, except when the paddles are deeply immersed in\r\nthe water, and this result may be better understood when we reflect that\r\nthe actual path of the floats through the water is not circular, as it\r\nwould be if the vessel itself did not move; for all points of the wheel\r\ndescribe peculiar curves called _cycloids_, which result from the\r\ncombination of the circular with the onward movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\n  THE “CLERMONT,” FROM A CONTEMPORARY DRAWING.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 59.—_Casting Cylinder of a Marine Steam Engine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe next figure, 60, exhibits a very common form of the screw propeller,\r\nand shows the position which it occupies in the ship. The reader may not\r\nat once understand how a comparatively small two-armed wheel revolving\r\nin a plane perpendicular to the direction of the vessel’s motion is able\r\nto propel the vessel forward. In order to understand the action of the\r\npropeller, he should recall to mind the manner in which a screw-nail in\r\na piece of wood advances by a distance equal to its pitch at every turn.\r\nIf he will conceive a gigantic screw-nail to be attached to the vessel\r\nextending along the keel,—and suppose for a moment that the water\r\nsurrounding this screw is not able to flow away from it, but that the\r\nscrew works through the water as the nail does in the wood,—he will have\r\nno difficulty in understanding that, under such circumstances, if the\r\nscrew were made to revolve, it would advance and carry the vessel with\r\nit. The reader may now form an accurate notion of the actual propeller\r\nby supposing the imaginary screw-nail to have the thread so deeply cut\r\nthat but little solid core is left in the centre, and supposing also\r\nthat only a very short piece of the screw is used—say the length of one\r\nrevolution—and that this is placed in the dead-wood. Such was the\r\nconstruction of the earlier screw-propellers, but now a still shorter\r\nportion of the screw is used; for instead of a complete turn of the\r\nthread, less than one-sixth is now the common construction. Such a strip\r\nor segment of the screw-thread forms a _blade_, and two, three, four, or\r\nmore blades are attached radially to one common axis. The blades spring\r\nwhen there are two from opposite points in the axis, and in other cases\r\nfrom points on the same circle. The blades of the propeller are cut and\r\ncarved into every variety of shape according to the ideas of the\r\ndesigner, but the fundamental principle is the same in all the forms. It\r\nneed hardly be said that the particles of the water are by no means\r\nfixed like those of the wood in which a screw advances. But as the water\r\nis not put in motion by the screw without offering some resistance by\r\nreason of its inertia, this resistance reacting on the screw operates in\r\nthe same manner, but not to the same extent, as the wood in the other\r\ncase. When we know the pitch of the screw, we can calculate what\r\ndistance the screw would be moved forward in a given number of\r\nrevolutions if it were working through a solid. This distance is usually\r\ngreater than the actual distance the ship is propelled, but in some\r\ncases the vessel is urged through the water with a greater velocity than\r\nif the screw were working in a solid nut. The shaft which carries the\r\nscrew extends from the stem to the centre of the ship where the engines\r\nare placed, and it passes outward through a bearing lined with wood, of\r\nwhich _lignum vitæ_ is found to be the best kind, the lubricant for this\r\nbearing being not oil but water. The screw would not have met with the\r\nsuccess it has attained but for this simple contrivance; for it was\r\nfound that with brass bearings a violent thumping action was soon\r\nproduced by the rapid rotation of the screw. The wearing action between\r\nthe wood and the iron is very slight, whereas brass bearings in this\r\nposition quickly wear and their adjustments become impaired. The\r\nscrew-shaft is very massive and is made in several lengths, which are\r\nsupported in appropriate bearings; there is also a special arrangement\r\nfor receiving the thrust of the shaft, for it is by this thrust received\r\nfrom the screw that the vessel is propelled, and the strain must be\r\ndistributed to some strong part of the ship’s frame. There is usually\r\nalso an arrangement by which the screw-shaft can, when required, be\r\ndisconnected from the engine, in order to allow the screw to turn freely\r\nby the action of the water when the vessel is under sail alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 60.—_Screw Propeller._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA screw-propeller has one important advantage over paddle-wheels in the\r\nfollowing particular: whereas the paddle-wheels act with the best effect\r\nwhen the wheel is immersed in the water to the depth of the lowest\r\nfloat, the efficiency of the screw when properly placed is not\r\npractically altered by the depth of immersion. As the coals with which a\r\nsteamer starts for a long voyage are consumed, the immersion is\r\ndecreased—hence the paddle-wheels of such a steamer can never be\r\nimmersed to the proper extent _throughout_ the voyage; they will be\r\nacting at a disadvantage during the greater part of the voyage. Again,\r\neven when the immersion of the vessel is such as to give the best\r\nadvantage to the paddle-wheels, that advantage is lost whenever a\r\nside-wind inclines the ship to one side, or whenever by the action of\r\nthe waves the immersion of the paddles is changed by excess or defect.\r\nFrom all such causes of inefficiency arising from the position of the\r\nvessel the screw-propeller is free. The reader will now understand why\r\npaddle-wheel steamers are at the present day constructed for inland\r\nwaters only.\r\n\r\nA great impulse was given to steam navigation, by the substitution of\r\niron for wood in the construction of ships. The weight of an iron ship\r\nis only two-thirds that of a wooden ship of the same size. It must be\r\nremembered that, though iron is many times heavier than wood, bulk for\r\nbulk, the required strength is obtained by a much less quantity of the\r\nformer. A young reader might, perhaps, think that a wooden ship must\r\nfloat better than an iron one; but the law of floating bodies is, that\r\nthe part of the floating body which is below the level of the water,\r\ntakes up the space of exactly so much water as would have the same\r\nweight as the floating body, or in fewer words, a floating body\r\ndisplaces its own _weight_ of water. Thus we see that an iron ship,\r\nbeing lighter than a wooden one, must have more buoyancy. The use of\r\niron in ship-building was strenuously advocated by the late Sir W.\r\nFairbairn, and his practical knowledge of the material gave great\r\nauthority to his opinion. He pointed out that the strains to which ships\r\nare exposed are of such a nature, that vessels should be made on much\r\nthe same principles as the built-up iron beams or girders of railway\r\nbridges. How successfully these principles have been applied will be\r\nnoticed in the case of the _Great Eastern_. This ship, by far the\r\nlargest vessel ever built, was designed by Mr. Brunel, and was intended\r\nto carry mails and passengers to India by the long sea route. The\r\nexpectations of the promoters were disappointed in regard to the speed\r\nof the vessel, which did not exceed 15 miles an hour; and no sooner had\r\nshe gone to sea than she met with a series of accidents, which appear,\r\nfor a time, to have destroyed public confidence in the vessel as a\r\nsea-going passenger ship. Some damage and much consternation were\r\nproduced on board by the explosion of a steam jacket a few days after\r\nthe launch. Then the huge ship encountered a strong gale in Holyhead\r\nHarbour, and afterwards was disabled by a hurricane in the Atlantic, in\r\nwhich her rudder and paddles were so damaged, that she rolled about for\r\nseveral days at the mercy of the waves. At New York she ran upon a rock,\r\nand the outer iron plates were stripped off the bottom of the ship for a\r\nlength of 80 ft. She was repaired and came home safely; but the\r\ncompanies which owned her found themselves in financial difficulties,\r\nand the big ship, which had cost half a million sterling, was sold for\r\nonly £25,000, or only about one-third of her value as old materials.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of the _Great Eastern_, and its failure as a commercial\r\nspeculation in the hands of its first proprietors, have been quoted as\r\nan illustration of the ill luck, if it might be so called, which seems\r\nto have attended several of the great works designed by the Brunels—for\r\nthe Thames Tunnel was, commercially, a failure; the Great Western\r\nRailway, with its magnificent embankments, cuttings, and tunnels, has\r\nreverted to the narrow gauge, and therefore the extra expense of the\r\nlarge scale has been financially thrown away; the Box Tunnel, a more\r\ntimid engineer would have avoided; and then there is the _Great\r\nEastern_. It is, however, equally remarkable that all these have been\r\nglorious and successful achievements as engineering works, and the\r\nscientific merit of their designers remains unimpaired by the merely\r\naccidental circumstance of their not bringing large dividends to their\r\nshareholders. Nor is their value to the world diminished by this\r\ncircumstance, for the Brunels showed mankind the way to accomplish\r\ndesigns which, perhaps, less gifted engineers would never have had the\r\nboldness to propose. The Box Tunnel led the way to other longer and\r\nlonger tunnels, culminating in that of Mont Cenis; but for the Thames\r\nTunnel—once ranked as the eighth wonder of the world—we should probably\r\nnot have heard of the English Channel Tunnel—a scheme which appears less\r\naudacious now than the other did then; if no _Great Eastern_ had\r\nexisted, we should not now have had an Atlantic Telegraph. Possibly this\r\nhuge ship is but the precursor of others still larger, and it is\r\nundoubtedly true that since its construction the ideas of naval\r\narchitects have been greatly enlarged, and the tendency is towards\r\nincreased size and speed in our steam-ships, whether for peace or war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 61.—_Section of Great Eastern Amidships._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 62.—_The Great Eastern in course of Construction._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe accidents which had happened to the ship had not, however,\r\nmaterially damaged either the hull or the machinery; and the _Great\r\nEastern_ was refitted, and afterwards employed in a service for which\r\nshe had not been designed, but which no other vessel could have\r\nattempted. This was the work of carrying and laying the whole length of\r\nthe Atlantic Telegraph Cable of 1865, of which 2,600 miles were shipped\r\non board in enormous tanks, that with the contents weighed upwards of\r\n5,000 tons. The ship has since been constantly engaged in similar\r\noperations.[1] The _Great Eastern_ is six times the size of our largest\r\nline-of-battle ships, and about seven times as large as the splendid\r\nsteamers of the Cunard line, which run between Liverpool and New York.\r\nShe has three times the steam power of the largest of these Atlantic\r\nsteamers, and could carry twenty times as many passengers, with coal for\r\nforty days’ consumption instead of fifteen. Her length is 692 ft.;\r\nwidth, 83 ft.; depth, 60 ft.; tonnage, 24,000 tons; draught of water\r\nwhen unloaded, 20 ft.; when loaded, 30 ft.; and a promenade round her\r\ndecks would be a walk of more than a quarter of a mile. The vessel is\r\nbuilt on the cellular plan to 3 ft. above the water-line; that is, there\r\nis an inner and an outer hull, each of iron plates ¾ in. thick, placed 2\r\nft. 10 in. apart, with ribs every 6 ft., and united by transverse\r\nplates, so that in place of the ribs of wooden ships, the hull is, as it\r\nwere, built up of curved cellular beams of wrought iron. The ship is\r\ndivided longitudinally by two vertical partitions or bulkheads of\r\nwrought iron, ½ in. thick. These are 350 ft. long and 60 ft. high, and\r\nare crossed at intervals by transverse bulkheads, in such a manner that\r\nthe ship is divided into nineteen compartments, of which twelve are\r\ncompletely water-tight, and the rest nearly so. The diagram (Fig. 61)\r\nrepresents a transverse section, and shows the cellular construction\r\nbelow the water-line. The strength and safety of the vessel are thus\r\namply provided for. The latter quality was proved in the accident to the\r\nship at New York; and the former was shown at the launch, for when the\r\nvessel stuck, and for two months could not be moved, it was found that,\r\nalthough one-quarter of the ship’s length was unsupported, it exhibited\r\nno deflection, or rather the amount of deflection was imperceptible.\r\nFig. 62 is from a photograph taken during the building of the ship, and\r\nFig. 63 shows the hull when completed and nearly ready for launching,\r\nwhile the vignette at the head of the chapter exhibits the big ship at\r\nanchor when completely equipped. The paddle-wheels are 56 ft. in\r\ndiameter, and are turned by four steam engines, each having a cylinder 6\r\nft. 2 in. in diameter, and 14 ft. in length. The vessel is also provided\r\nwith a four-bladed screw-propeller of 24 ft. diameter, driven by another\r\nengine having four cylinders, six boilers, and seventy-two furnaces. The\r\ntotal actual power of the engines is more than that of 8,000 horses, and\r\nthe vessel could carry coals enough to take her round the world—a\r\ncapability which was the object of her enormous size. The vessel as\r\noriginally constructed contained accommodation for 800 first-class\r\npassengers, 2,000 second class, and 1,200 third class—that is, for 4,000\r\npassengers in all. The principal saloon was 100 ft. long, 36 ft. wide,\r\nand 13 ft. high. Each of her ten boilers weighs 50 tons, and when all\r\nare in action, 12 tons of coal are burnt every hour, and the total\r\ndisplacement of the vessel laden with coal is 22,500 tons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  She was broken up for old iron, 1889.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 63.—_The Great Eastern ready for Launching._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe use of steam power in navigation has increased at an amazing rate.\r\nBetween 1850 and 1860 the tonnage of the steam shipping entering the\r\nport of London increased three-fold, and every reader knows that there\r\nare many fleets of fine steamers plying to ports of the United Kingdom.\r\nThere are, for example, the splendid Atlantic steamers, some of which\r\nalmost daily enter or leave Liverpool, and the well-appointed ships\r\nbelonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company. The steamers on the\r\nHolyhead and Kingston line may be taken as good examples of first-class\r\npassenger ships. These are paddle-wheel boats, and are constructed\r\nentirely of iron, with the exception of the deck and cabin fittings.\r\nTaking one of these as a type of the rest, we may note the following\r\nparticulars: the vessel is 334 ft. long, the diameter of the\r\npaddle-wheels is 31 ft., and each has fourteen floats, which are 12 ft.\r\nlong and 4 ft. 4 in. wide. The cylinders of the engines are 8 ft. 2 in.\r\nin diameter, and 6 ft. 6 in. long. The ship cost about £75,000. The\r\naverage passage between the two ports—a distance of 65½ miles—occupies 3\r\nhours 52 minutes, and at the measured mile the vessel attained the speed\r\nof 20·811 miles per hour. As an example of the magnificent vessels owned\r\nby the Cunard Company, we shall give now a few figures relating to one\r\nof their largest steam-ships, the _Persia_, launched in 1858, and built\r\nby Mr. N. Napier, of Glasgow, for the company, to carry mails and\r\npassengers between Liverpool and New York. Her length is 389 ft., and\r\nher breadth 45 ft. She is a paddle-wheel steamer, with engines of 850\r\nhorse-power, having cylinders 100 in. in diameter with a stroke of 10\r\nft. The paddle-wheels are 38 ft. 6 in. in diameter, and each has\r\ntwenty-eight floats, 10 ft. 8 in. long and 2 ft. wide. The _Persia_\r\ncarries 1,200 tons of coal, and displaces about 5,400 tons of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 64.—_Comparative Sizes of Steamships._\r\n\r\n  1838, _Great Western_; 1844, _Great Britain_; 1856, _Persia_; 1858,\r\n    _Great Eastern_.\r\n\r\n  A, Section amidships of _Great Eastern_; B, The same of _Great\r\n    Western_. Both on the same scale, but on a larger one than their\r\n    profiles.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA velocity of twenty-six miles per hour appears to be about the highest\r\nyet attained by a steamer.[2] This is probably near the limit beyond\r\nwhich the speed cannot be increased to any useful purpose. The\r\nresistance offered by water to a vessel moving through it increases more\r\nrapidly than the velocity. Thus, if a vessel were made to move through\r\nthe water by being pulled with a rope, there would be a certain strain\r\nupon the rope when the vessel was dragged, say, at the rate of five\r\nmiles an hour. If we desired the vessel to move at double the speed, the\r\nstrain on the rope must be increased four-fold. To increase the velocity\r\nto fifteen miles per hour, we should have to pull the vessel with nine\r\ntimes the original force. This is expressed by saying that the\r\nresistance varies as the square of the velocity. Hence, to double the\r\nspeed, the impelling force must be quadrupled, and as that force is\r\nexerted through twice the distance in the same time, an engine would be\r\nrequired of eight times the power—or, in other words, the power of the\r\nengine must be increased in proportion to the _cube_ of the velocity; so\r\nthat to propel a boat at the rate of 15 miles an hour would require\r\nengines twenty-seven times more powerful than those which would suffice\r\nto propel it at the rate of five miles an hour.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  This has now (1895) been far surpassed.—_Vide infra._\r\n\r\nThe actual speed attained by steam-ships with engines of a given power\r\nand a given section amidships will depend greatly upon the shape of the\r\nvessel. When the bow is sharp, the water displaced is more gradually and\r\nslowly moved aside, and therefore does not offer nearly so much\r\nresistance as in the opposite case; but the greater part of the power\r\nrequired to urge the vessel forward is employed in overcoming a\r\nresistance which in some degree resembles friction between the bottom of\r\nthe vessel and the water.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful progress which has, in a comparatively short time, taken\r\nplace in the power and size of steam-vessels, cannot be better brought\r\nhome to the reader than by a glance at Fig. 64, which gives the profiles\r\nof four steamships, drawn on one and the same scale, thus showing the\r\nrelative lengths and depths of those vessels, each of which was the\r\nlargest ship afloat at the date which is marked below it, and the whole\r\nperiod includes only the brief space of twenty years!—for this, surely,\r\nis a brief space in the history of such an art as navigation. All these\r\nships have been named in the course of this article, but in the\r\nfollowing table a few particulars concerning each are brought together\r\nfor the sake of comparing the figures:\r\n\r\n     ┌─────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬────────┬────────┐\r\n     │Date.│      Name.      │   Propulsion.   │Length. │Breadth.│\r\n     ├─────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼────────┼────────┤\r\n     │1838 │_Great Western_  │Paddles          │236 ft. │ 36 ft. │\r\n     │1844 │_Great Britain_  │Screw            │322 ft. │ 51 ft. │\r\n     │1856 │_Persia_         │Paddles          │390 ft. │ 45 ft. │\r\n     │1858 │_Great Eastern_  │Screw and paddles│690 ft. │ 83 ft. │\r\n     └─────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────┴────────┘\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 65.—_The s.s. City of Rome._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSeveral passenger ocean-going steamships have been built since the\r\n_Persia_, of still greater dimensions, and of higher engine power. These\r\nhave generally been surpassed in late years by some splendid Atlantic\r\nliners, such as the sister vessels owned by the International Navigation\r\nCo., and now named respectively the _New York_ and the _Paris_. The\r\n_City of Rome_, launched in 1881 by the Barrow Steamship Co., is little\r\ninferior in length to the _Great Eastern_, although the tonnage is only\r\nabout one-third. The _City of Rome_ is 560 ft. long, 52 ft. wide, and 37\r\nft. deep. Her engines are capable of working up to 10,000 indicated\r\nhorse-power. Fig. 65 is a sketch of this ship, and shows that she\r\ncarries four masts and three funnels. The main shaft measures more than\r\n2 ft. across, and the screw-propeller is 24 ft. in diameter. She has\r\naccommodation for 1,500 passengers, and is fitted with all the\r\nconveniences and luxuries of a well-appointed hotel. The International\r\nNavigation Co.’s ship _Paris_, has made the passage across the Atlantic\r\nin less than six days, and appears to be the fastest vessel in the\r\ntransatlantic service. In August, 1889, she made the run from shore to\r\nshore in 5 days, 22 hours, 38 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary increase in the speed of steamships that has been\r\neffected within the last few years depends mainly upon the improvements\r\nthat have latterly been made in the marine engine—a machine of which we\r\nhave been unable to give an account, because its details are too\r\nnumerous and complicated to be followed out by the general reader.\r\nSuffice it to say, that the use of higher steam pressures with compound\r\nexpansion (p. 18), condensers which admit of the same fresh water being\r\nused in the boilers over and over again, and better furnace\r\narrangements, are among the more important of these improvements. But\r\nnot only have the limits of practicable speed been enlarged, but a\r\ngreater economy of fuel for the work done has been attained; the result\r\nbeing that ocean carriage is now cheaper than ever. The outcome of this\r\nwill not cease with simply a greatly extended steam navigation, but\r\nappears destined ultimately to produce effects on the world at large\r\ncomparable in range and magnitude with those that may be traced to the\r\nuse of the steam engine itself since its first invention.\r\n\r\nAmong the curiosities of steamboat construction may be mentioned a\r\nremarkable ship which was built a few years ago for carrying passengers\r\nacross the English Channel without the unpleasant rolling experienced in\r\nthe ordinary steamboats. The vessel, which received the name of the\r\n_Castalia_, was designed by Captain Dicey, who formerly held an official\r\nposition at the Port of Calcutta. His Indian experience furnished him\r\nwith the first suggestion of the new ship in the device which is adopted\r\nthere for steadying boats in the heavy surf. The plan is to attach a log\r\nof timber to the ends of two outriggers, which project some distance\r\nfrom the side of the vessel; or sometimes two canoes, a certain distance\r\napart, are connected together. Some of these Indian boats will ride\r\nsteadily in a swell that will cause large steamers to roll heavily.\r\nImproving on this hint, Captain Dicey built a vessel with two hulls,\r\neach of which acted as an outrigger to the other. Or, perhaps, the\r\n_Castalia_ may be described as a flat-bottomed vessel with the middle\r\npart of the bottom raised out of the water throughout the entire length,\r\nso that the section amidships had a form like this—\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe two hulls were connected by what we may term “girders,” which\r\nextended completely across their sections, forming transverse partitions\r\nor bulkheads, and these girders were strongly framed together, so as to\r\nform rigid triangles. These united the two hulls so completely, that\r\nthere was not any danger of the vessel being strained in a sea-way. The\r\ndecks were also formed of iron, although covered with wood, so that the\r\nwhole vessel really formed a box girder of enormous section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 66.—_The Castalia in Dover Harbour._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe reason why the steamers which until lately ran between Dover and\r\nCalais, Folkestone and Boulogne, and other Channel ports, were so small,\r\nwas because the harbours on either side could not receive vessels with\r\nsuch a draught as the fine steamers, for example, which run on the\r\nHolyhead and Kingston line. Now, the _Castalia_ drew only 6 ft. of\r\nwater, or 1 ft. 6 in. less than the small Channel steamers, and would,\r\ntherefore, be able to enter the French ports at all states of the tide.\r\nYet the extent of the deck space was equalled in few passenger ships\r\nafloat, except the _Great Eastern_ and some of the Atlantic steamers.\r\nThe vessel was 290 ft. in length, with an extreme breadth of 60 ft. The\r\nfour spacious and elegantly-fitted saloons—two of which were 60 ft. by\r\n36 ft., and two 28 ft. by 26 ft.—and the roomy cabins, retiring rooms,\r\nand lavatories, were the greatest possible contrast to the “cribbed,\r\ncabined, and confined” accommodation of the ordinary Channel steamers.\r\nThere were also a kitchen and all requisites for supplying dinners,\r\nluncheons, etc., on board. But besides the above-named saloons and\r\ncabins, there was a grand saloon, which was 160 ft. long and 60 ft.\r\nwide; and the roof of this formed a magnificent promenade 14 ft. above\r\nthe level of the sea. There was comfortable accommodation in the vessel\r\nfor more than 1,000 passengers.\r\n\r\nThe inner sides of the hulls were not curved like the outside, but were\r\nstraight, with a space between them of 35 ft. wide, and the hulls were\r\neach 20 ft. in breadth, and somewhat more in depth. There were two\r\npaddle-wheels, placed abreast of each other in the water-way between the\r\ntwo hulls, and each of these contained boilers and powerful engines. The\r\ndesigners of this vessel calculated that she would attain a speed of 14¾\r\nknots per hour, but this result failed to be realized. Probably there\r\nwere no data for the effect of paddles working in a confined\r\nwater-space. The position of the paddles is otherwise an advantage, as\r\nit leaves the sides of the vessel free and unobstructed. The ship had\r\nthe same form at each end, so it could move equally well in either\r\ndirection. There were rudders at both ends, and the steering qualities\r\nof the ship were good. Although the speed of the _Castalia_ was below\r\nthat intended, the vessel was a success as regards steadiness, for the\r\nrolling and pitching were very greatly reduced, and the miseries and\r\ninconveniences of the Channel passage obviated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 67.—_The Castalia in Dover Harbour—End View._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _Castalia_ is represented in Figs. 66 and 67. She was constructed by\r\nthe Thames Iron Shipbuilding Co., and launched in June, 1874, but after\r\nshe had been tried at sea, it was found necessary to fit her with\r\nimproved boilers, and this caused a delay in placing the vessel on her\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThe _Castalia_ proved a failure in point of speed, and she was soon\r\nreplaced by another and more powerful vessel constructed on the same\r\ngeneral plan, and named the _Calais-Douvres_. But this twin-ship again\r\nfailed to answer expectations, and as the harbour on the French shore\r\nwas meanwhile deepened and improved, new and very fine paddle-wheel\r\nboats, named the _Invicta_, _Victoria_, and _Empress_ have been placed\r\non the service. As the latter boat, at least, has steamed from Dover to\r\nCalais, nearly twenty-six miles, under the hour, there is nothing more\r\nto be desired in point of speed. A fourth vessel is to take the place of\r\nthe twin-ship, _Calais-Douvres_, and will receive the same name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 68.—_Bessemer Steamer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother very novel and curious invention connected with steam navigation\r\nwas the steamer which Mr. Bessemer built at Hull in 1874. This invention\r\nalso was to abolish all the unpleasant sensations which landsmen are apt\r\nto experience in a sea voyage, by effectually removing the cause of the\r\ndistressing _mal de mer_. The ship was built for plying between the\r\nshores of France and England, and the method by which he purposed to\r\ncarry passengers over the restless sea which separates us from our\r\nGallic neighbours was bold and ingenious. He designed a spacious saloon,\r\nwhich, instead of partaking of the rolling and tossing of the ship, was\r\nto be maintained in an absolutely level position. The saloon was\r\nsuspended on pivots, much in the same way as a mariner’s compass is\r\nsuspended; and by an application of hydraulic power it was intended to\r\ncounteract the motion of the ship and maintain the swinging saloon\r\nperfectly horizontal. It was originally proposed that the movements\r\nshould be regulated by a man stationed for that purpose, where he could\r\nwork the levers for bringing the machinery into action, so as to\r\npreserve the saloon in the required position. This plan was, however,\r\nimproved upon, and the adjustments made automatic. It may be well to\r\nmention that it is a mistake to suppose that anything freely suspended,\r\nlike a pendulum, on board a ship rolling with the waves, will hang\r\nvertically. If, however, we cause a heavy disc to spin very rapidly, say\r\nin a horizontal plane, the disc cannot be moved out of the horizontal\r\nplane without the application of some force. A very well-made disc may\r\nbe made to rotate for hours, and would, by preserving its original plane\r\nof rotation, even show the effect of the earth’s diurnal motion. Mr.\r\nBessemer designed such a gyroscope to move the valves of his hydraulic\r\napparatus, and so to keep his swinging saloon as persistently horizontal\r\nas the gyroscope itself. Mr. Bessemer’s ship was 350 ft. long, and each\r\nend, for a distance of 48 ft., was only about 4 ft. from the line of\r\nfloating. Above the low ends a breastwork was raised, about 8 ft. high,\r\nand 254 ft. long. In the centre, and occupying the space of 90 ft., was\r\nthe swinging saloon intended for first-class passengers. At either end\r\nof this apartment were the engines and boilers. The engines were\r\noscillating and expansive, working up to 4,600 horse-power, which could\r\nbe increased to 5,000. There were two pairs of engines, one set at\r\neither end of the ship, and each having two cylinders of 80 in. in\r\ndiameter, and a stroke of 5 ft., working with steam of 30 lbs. pressure\r\nper square inch, supplied from four box-shaped boilers, each boiler\r\nhaving four large furnaces. The paddle-wheels, of which there were a\r\npair on either side of the vessel, were 27 ft. 10 in. in diameter\r\noutside the outer ring, and each wheel has twelve feathering floats. The\r\nleading pair of wheels, when working at full speed, were to make\r\nthirty-two revolutions per minute, and the following pair of wheels move\r\nfaster.\r\n\r\nEntrance into the Bessemer saloon was gained by two broad staircases\r\nleading to one landing, and a flexible passage from this point to the\r\nsaloon. The saloon rested on four steel gudgeons, one at each end, and\r\ntwo close together near the middle. These were not only to support the\r\nsaloon, but also to convey the water to the hydraulic engines, by which\r\nthe saloon was to be kept steady. For this purpose the after one was\r\nmade hollow, and connected with the water mains from powerful engines,\r\nand also with a supply-pipe leading to a central valve-box, by means of\r\nwhich the two hydraulic cylinders on either side were supplied with\r\nwater. Between the two middle gudgeons, a gyroscope, worked by a small\r\nturbine, filled with water from one of the gudgeons, enabled Mr.\r\nBessemer to dispense with the services of a man, and thus completed his\r\nscheme of a steady saloon, by making the machinery completely automatic.\r\nThe saloon was 70 ft. long, 35 ft. wide, and 20 ft. high. The Bessemer\r\nship proved to be a total failure, and never went to sea as a passenger\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nOn board of some modern war-ships where speed is essential, and where\r\nthe engines are driven at a very great number of revolutions per minute,\r\nas in the case of torpedo-boat catchers, the vibration throughout the\r\nwhole of the vessel becomes extremely trying, not only for the nerves of\r\nthe crew, but for the security of the structure itself. The cause of\r\nthis vibration and consequent strain and loss of power is not far to\r\nseek. The cylinders of marine engines are always of a large diameter, 6\r\nfeet, 8 feet, or even more sometimes, and the pistons and piston-rods\r\nare necessarily of great strength and corresponding weight. Now, at\r\nevery half revolution of the engines, this heavy mass of piston and\r\npiston-rod, though moving at an exceedingly high speed in the middle of\r\nthe stroke, has to be brought to a standstill, and an equal velocity in\r\nthe opposite direction imparted to it. A large portion of the power is\r\ntherefore uselessly expended in stopping a great moving mass, and\r\nreversing its motion. All the force required to do this reacts on the\r\nvessel’s frame. Many attempts have been made to construct rotatory\r\nsteam-engines, and some hundreds of patents taken out for such\r\ninventions, which in general have a piston revolving about a shaft; but\r\nthe great friction, and consequent liability to wear out, have prevented\r\ntheir practical use.\r\n\r\nLately, a method of using steam on the principle embodied in the water\r\nturbine has been developed, and within the last six or seven years has\r\nfound successful application in propelling electro-dynamos at very high\r\nspeeds. In the steam turbine there are no pistons, piston-rods, or other\r\nreciprocating parts, the effect depending on the same kind of reaction\r\nthat is taken advantage of in the water turbine (which has a high\r\nefficiency in giving out a large proportion of energy), and the power is\r\napplied with smoothness and an entire absence of the oscillations that\r\nwould shake to pieces any vessel that an ordinary steam-engine could\r\npropel at the same rate.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the steam turbine have been proved by the performances\r\nof a small experimental vessel lately built at Newcastle, and\r\nappropriately named the _Turbinia_. She is only 100 feet in length, and\r\n9 feet in breadth, with a displacement of some 44 tons. Now the highest\r\nrecord speed for any vessel of that size is 24 knots per hour; but the\r\n_Turbinia_, in a heavy sea, showed, at a measured mile, the speed of 32¾\r\nknots, which is believed to be greater than that of any craft now\r\nafloat, being nearly 37¾ miles an hour, or equal to that of an ordinary\r\nrailway train. Besides that, it has been found by experiment, that an\r\narrangement of the blades of the screw propeller more suitable to high\r\nvelocities will enable a still greater speed to be obtained. The weight\r\nof the turbine engines of this vessel is only 3 tons, 13 cwts., and the\r\nwhole weight of the machinery, including boilers and condensers, is only\r\n22 tons, with an indicated H.P. of 1576, and a steam consumption of but\r\n16 lbs. per hour. The weight of the turbine is only one-fifth of that of\r\nmarine engines of equal power; the space occupied is smaller; the\r\ninitial cost is less; not so much superintendence is required; the\r\ncharges of maintenance are diminished; reduced dimensions of propeller\r\nand shaft suffice; vibration is eliminated; speed is increased; and\r\ngreater economy of fuel is secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _THE RIVER AND LAKE STEAM-BOATS OF AMERICA._\r\n\r\nThe chapter on “Steam Navigation,” in the foregoing pages, has dealt\r\nmainly with the progress of the ocean-going steam-ship, from the\r\nestablishment of regular transatlantic services down to the building of\r\nthe splendid liners, the _New York_ and the _Paris_, and we have\r\nrecorded, in addition, the performances of the pair of hitherto\r\nunsurpassed sister ships, the _Campania_ and the _Lucania_. The\r\nimportance and interest attaching to steam navigation is, however, by no\r\nmeans confined to ocean-going vessels, and the chapter demands a\r\nsupplementary notice of the great developments of the steam-ship in\r\nother parts of the world than Britain, more particularly where great\r\nrivers, navigable for hundreds of miles, and lakes, spreading their\r\nwaters over vast areas, present conditions of traffic and opportunities\r\nfor adaptation to an extent that could not be required within the range\r\nof Britain or British oceanic lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE IX.\r\n\r\n  THE “MARY POWELL.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the reader will cast his eye on the map of the United States, he will\r\nsee towards the northern boundary a great fresh-water system, comprising\r\nfive enormous lakes, the least of which is nearly two hundred, and the\r\nlargest nearly three hundred miles in length, in all presenting a total\r\narea greater by far than that of England and Scotland together thrice\r\ntold. This lake system has a line of coast to be reckoned only by\r\nthousands of miles, and for a long time an enormous traffic has been\r\ncarried across its waters by sailing vessels of all kinds, two- or\r\nthree-masted schooners, brigs, and other craft, carrying wood, stone,\r\nlime, and other commodities. On the map, the position of the Detroit\r\nRiver, which leads from the southern extremity of Lake Huron to Lake\r\nErie, will readily be recognised, and this strait, which is in the only\r\nline of transport from the three great upper lakes, formerly presented\r\nall the picturesqueness that crowds of boats of every build could\r\nimpart. Especially was this the case at Amherstburg, its southern\r\nextremity, where sometimes a northern wind would make the passage\r\nimpracticable for several days in succession, and a fleet of a hundred\r\nor two hundred sailing vessels would collect to await the opportunity of\r\na favouring breeze in order to carry them against the current to Port\r\nHuron. Then, taking advantage of the right moment, they would set their\r\nsails, and in a compact body move slowly up the strait. This was not\r\nquick enough to meet the traffic, and, before long, larger vessels were\r\nbuilt, which were towed up and down the Detroit by steam-tugs. The next\r\nstep of replacing sailing ships by steam-vessels was not long in\r\nfollowing, and though there still exist fine specimens of sailing craft\r\non the lakes, their day may be said to be over. The navigation of these\r\nlakes, before the extensive development of the railway systems near\r\ntheir shores, comprised a large passenger traffic, which was carried on\r\nby big paddle-wheel steamers, and at the time of the great westward set\r\nof emigration to Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, these steamers were\r\ncrowded to their utmost capacity. The great improvement which in recent\r\nyears has become possible for passenger steamers in speed, cabin\r\naccommodation, and other particulars, above all, the growth of great\r\ncities on the shores, the progress of the territories adjoining the lake\r\nsystem, and other circumstances, are now combining to renew the\r\npassenger traffic on a larger scale than ever. “Fifteen millions of\r\npeople,” says Mr. H. A. Griffin, the Secretary of the Cleveland Board of\r\nControl (_Engineering Magazine_, iv., 819), “now live upon the shore\r\nlines of the lakes, or within six hours’ travel by rail, and nearly all\r\nof that population is south of the United States boundary line. The\r\nterritory directly tributary to the lakes, north and south of the line,\r\nis capable of easily maintaining a population of 100,000,000.... It does\r\nnot require a very lively imagination to foresee the Great Lakes\r\nsurrounded by the most prosperous and progressive people on earth, and\r\ncrossed and recrossed by scores of lines of passenger steam-ships, in\r\naddition to a still greater number of freight lines.” The number of\r\nfirst-class passenger steamers already launched or on the stocks is an\r\nindication that the revival of passenger traffic will not lag or be\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nThe unique conditions and requirements of this lacustrine traffic were\r\nbound to lead to types of vessels differing in many respects from the\r\nsteam-ships to be seen in the harbours of Great Britain. The\r\nintroduction of iron shipbuilding gave a great impetus to the\r\nconstruction of the lake steamers, for vessels of more than 3,000 tons\r\ncould be built with a comparatively shallow draught of water (15½ feet),\r\nwhich was one of the necessities of the situation. As far back as 1872,\r\niron shipbuilding had been fully established at Cleveland and Detroit,\r\nand at the latter place scores of splendid steel steam-ships have been\r\nturned out. The Cleveland builders have not been far behind, and\r\nBuffalo, Milwaukee, Chicago, and other places, have followed suit. At\r\nthe beginning of 1893, there were on the lakes more than fifty vessels\r\nof over 2,000 tons each, while the total number of steam vessels of all\r\nkinds was considerably over 1,600, and sailing vessels with steam-tugs\r\ncounted over 2,000. The tonnage of the ships on the lakes has been\r\nestimated at about 36 per cent. of the whole mercantile marine of the\r\nUnited States, and it is said that 40,000 men are employed upon the\r\nvessels. The total freight passing Detroit in 1892 was calculated to\r\nexceed 34,000,000 tons, an amount greater than the whole foreign and\r\ncoasting trade of the port of London. There are more than thirty\r\nshipbuilding concerns on the lakes, and some of them possess large dry\r\ndocks of their own; but there are also independent companies owning dry\r\ndocks of great size. Some of these shipbuilding establishments have\r\nturned out steel ocean-going tugs, paddle and screw passenger steamers,\r\ncargo-carrying boats, vessels for carrying railway trains across the\r\nDetroit river, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 68_a_.—_A Whaleback Steamer, No. 85, Built at West Superior,\r\n    Wisconsin._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe extent and importance which steam navigation has attained in a\r\ndefinite region have been indicated in the preceding paragraphs; but an\r\nattempt to show by illustration and description the several\r\ncharacteristic forms the steam-ship has now assumed in these lacustrine\r\nwaters would carry us far beyond our allotted limits. The steam vessels\r\nnow on the lakes are almost exclusively actuated by screw-propellers,\r\nwhether they are passenger or freight boats. The boilers and engines are\r\nnear the stern, and the hulls are usually of great length; in fact, some\r\nof these steamboats will compare in dimensions with the _Persia_, which\r\nwas the transatlantic marvel about the year 1857. (See p. 137.) Such is\r\nthe _Mariposa_, launched in 1892, which is 350 feet long and 45 feet\r\nbroad, carrying 3,800 net tons, with a draught of only 15½ feet. There\r\nare others, 380 feet long, with engines of 7,000 horse-power, steaming\r\nat 20 miles an hour, and providing ample accommodation for 600\r\npassengers. The newest and most novel type of steam-ship on the lakes is\r\nthe “whaleback.” The celerity with which ships of this kind have been\r\nconstructed on occasion is perfectly marvellous. One of them, named the\r\n_Christopher Columbus_, designed to carry passengers to and from the\r\nWorld’s Fair at Chicago in 1893, was launched in fifty-six days after\r\nthe keel had been laid, yet it was a ship intended to carry 5,000\r\npassengers, having a length over all of 362 feet, breadth 42 feet, depth\r\n24 feet. The “whaleback” steamers are designed to give the greatest\r\ncarrying capacity with a given draught of water, and all the structures\r\nusually fitted to the upper deck of a steamer are in them replaced by\r\nthe plain curved and closed deck, over which, when the vessel is in a\r\nstorm, waves may sweep harmlessly, thus avoiding the shocks received by\r\nships with high sides.\r\n\r\nThe river steam-boat was, as we have seen, nearly coeval with the\r\nnineteenth century, and although its practicability was first\r\ndemonstrated in British waters, regular steam navigation was not\r\nestablished until a few years afterwards, when, in 1807, Robert Fulton\r\nplaced on the River Hudson its first steam-boat. To this others were\r\nsoon added, so that in 1813 there were six steam-boats regularly plying\r\non the Hudson before a single one ran for hire on the Thames. An article\r\nby Mr. Samuel Ward Stanton, in a recent number of _The Engineering\r\nMagazine_, gives a very full account of the Hudson River steam-boats\r\nfrom the beginning down to 1894, and to this article we are mainly\r\nindebted for the details we are about to give.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson River washes the western shore of Manhattan Island, on which\r\nstands by far the greater part of the city of New York, with its vast\r\npopulation. The river is here straight, and has a nearly uniform width\r\nof one mile; at New York it is commonly called the _North River_,\r\nbecause of the direction of its course, for it descends from almost the\r\ndue north. It is not one of the great rivers of the United States as\r\nregards length or extent of navigation; not, _e.g._, like the\r\nMississippi and the Missouri, which are ascended by steam-boats to\r\nthousands of miles above their mouths; but it has one of the world’s\r\ngreat capitals on its shores, and at the quays, which occupy both its\r\nbanks to the number of eighty or more, may be seen in multitudes some of\r\nthe finest ocean-going steamships, trading to every considerable port in\r\nthe world. The North River separates New York from what are practically\r\nthe populous suburbs of Jersey City and Hoboken, though these are\r\ncontrolled by their own municipalities.\r\n\r\nIt was on the River Hudson that steam navigation was inaugurated by\r\nFulton with a vessel which was 133 feet long, 18 feet broad, and 7 feet\r\ndeep, and was named the _Clermont_. The speed attained was but five\r\nmiles an hour. The first trip was made on the 7th August, 1807, to\r\nAlbany, 150 miles up the river from New York, with twenty-four\r\npassengers on board, and the new kind of locomotion was so well\r\npatronised that during the following winter, when the Hudson navigation\r\nhad to be suspended on account of the ice, it was considered expedient\r\nto enlarge the capacity of the boat by adding both to her length and\r\nwidth; at the same time her name was changed to _The North River_, and\r\nshe plied regularly for several seasons afterwards. Her speed down the\r\nriver with the current was evidently greater than that of the first trip\r\nup the river, for on 9th November, 1809, the New York _Evening Post_\r\nannounced that “The North River steam-boat arrived this afternoon in\r\ntwenty-seven and a half hours from Albany, with sixty passengers.”\r\n\r\nThe paddle-wheels were of a primitive form, and as they were unprovided\r\nwith paddle-boxes, the arrangement had the appearance of a great\r\nundershot mill-wheel on each side of the boat, above the deck of which\r\nwas placed the steam-engine, a position it has retained in all these\r\nriver-boats, in which a huge, rhombus-shaped beam, oscillating high\r\nabove the deck, is a conspicuous feature. Another boat of much larger\r\ndimensions was built the following year, having a tonnage of nearly 300,\r\nand from that time there has been a more or less regular increase in the\r\nsizes of the vessels, until in 1866 a tonnage of nearly 3,000 was\r\nreached. In 1817 a vessel called the _Livingstone_ was launched, which\r\nwas able to go up to Albany in eighteen hours. In 1823 was launched the\r\n_James Kent_, a novel feature in which vessel was the boiler made of\r\ncopper, and weighing upwards of 30 tons. It was so planned that if it\r\nhappened to burst, the hot water would be carried through the bottom of\r\nthe vessel by tubes or hollow pillars. From this it appears that\r\nconsiderable apprehension existed as to the liability of the boilers\r\nexploding. We are told that the cost of the copper boiler was in this\r\ncase nearly one-third of that of the whole vessel. The cabins are\r\ndescribed as having been very handsomely fitted up, and the speed was\r\nsuch that fourteen hours sufficed for the trip up river to Albany. Many\r\nfine boats were placed on the river during the twenty following years,\r\nand these were marked by various improvements, as when, in 1840,\r\nanthracite coal was for the first time substituted for wood as the fuel\r\nfor the furnaces, with the effect of reducing the cost of this item to\r\none-half. Then, in 1844, iron began to be used for constructing the\r\nhulls, and a few years afterwards, steamers having a speed of twenty\r\nmiles an hour and over, became quite common. In 1865, and again in the\r\neighties, some four screw-propeller boats were built; but this type does\r\nnot appear to have found much favour on the Hudson, for the large\r\npaddle-wheels and the single or double beam, working high above the\r\ndeck, have continued the almost universal form of construction. A very\r\npopular and famous boat was placed on the Hudson in 1861. This was the\r\n_Mary Powell_, called the “Queen of the Hudson,” which, although a boat\r\nof moderate tonnage (983), was able on occasion to steam at the rate of\r\ntwenty-five miles an hour. This vessel was placed on the line between\r\nNew York and Rondont, and was still running in 1894.\r\n\r\nOne of the most modern and most elegant boats on the Hudson is the _New\r\nYork_, launched in 1887, and declared by Mr. Stanton to be one of the\r\nfinest river steam-boats in the world, well arranged, and beautifully\r\nfinished and furnished. She is built on fine lines, is 311 feet long, 40\r\nfeet broad, and with a tonnage of 1,552, draws only 12¼ feet of water.\r\nShe can steam at twenty miles an hour, and is placed on one of the New\r\nYork and Albany lines. Throughout the summer there are both day and\r\nnight boats for Albany, and the latter especially are of great size,\r\nthree stories high, and provided with saloons, state-rooms, and, in\r\nfact, all the accommodation of a luxurious first-class hotel. The\r\nvessels named in this notice include but a few of the splendid boats\r\nthat ply on the River Hudson, and, in respect of their numbers, speed,\r\nand comfort, it may safely be asserted that they cannot be equalled on\r\nany other river in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE X.\r\n\r\n  THE “NEW YORK.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 69.—_H.M.S. Devastation in Queenstown Harbour._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SHIPS OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Take it all in all, a ship of the line is the most honourable thing\r\nthat man, as a gregarious animal, has ever produced. By himself,\r\nunhelped, he can do better things than ships of the line; he can make\r\npoems, and pictures, and other such concentrations of what is best in\r\nhim. But as a being living in flocks, and hammering out with alternate\r\nstrokes and mutual agreement, what is necessary for him in those flocks\r\nto get or produce, the ship of the line is his first work. Into that he\r\nhas put as much of his human patience, common sense, forethought,\r\nexperimental philosophy, self-control, habits of order and obedience,\r\nthoroughly wrought hand-work, defiance of brute elements, careless\r\ncourage, careful patriotism, and calm expectation of the judgment of\r\nGod, as can well be put into a space of 300 ft. long by 80 ft. broad.\r\nAnd I am thankful to have lived in an age when I could see this thing so\r\ndone.” So wrote Mr. Ruskin about forty years ago, referring, of course,\r\nto the old wooden line-of-battle ships. It may be doubted whether he\r\nwould have written thus enthusiastically about so unpicturesque an\r\nobject as the _Glatton_, just as it may be doubted whether the\r\narmour-plated steamers will attain the same celebrity in romance and in\r\nverse as the old frigates with their “wooden walls.” Certain it is that\r\nthe patience, forethought, experimental philosophy, thoroughly wrought\r\nhand-work, careful patriotism, and other good qualities which Mr. Ruskin\r\nsaw in the wooden frigates, are not the less displayed in the new\r\nironclads.\r\n\r\nFloating batteries, plated with iron, were employed in the Crimean War\r\nat the instigation of the French Emperor. About the same time the\r\nquestion of protecting ships of war by some kind of defensive armour was\r\nforced upon the attention of maritime powers, by the great strides with\r\nwhich the improvements in artillery were advancing; for the new guns\r\ncould hurl projectiles capable of penetrating, with the greatest ease,\r\nany wooden ship afloat. The French Government took the initiative by\r\nconstructing _La Gloire_, a timber-framed ship, covered with an armour\r\nof rolled iron plates, 4½ in. thick. The British Admiralty quickly\r\nfollowed with the _Warrior_, a frigate similar in shape to the wooden\r\nfrigates, but built on an iron frame, with armour composed of plates 4½\r\nin. thick, backed by 18 in. of solid teak-wood, and provided with an\r\ninner skin of iron. The _Warrior_ was 380 ft. long, but only 213 ft. of\r\nthis length was armoured. The defensive armour carried by the _Warrior_,\r\nand the ironclads constructed immediately afterwards, was quite capable\r\nof resisting the impact of the 68 lb. shot, which was at that time the\r\nheaviest projectile that could be thrown by naval guns. But to the\r\nincreasing power of the new artillery it soon became necessary to oppose\r\nincreased thickness of iron plates. The earlier ironclads carried a\r\nconsiderable number of guns, which could, however, deliver only a\r\nbroadside fire, that is, the shots could, for the most part, be sent\r\nonly in a direction at right angles to the ship’s length, or nearly so.\r\nBut in the more recently built ironclads there are very few guns, which\r\nare, however, six times the weight of the old sixty-eight pounders, and\r\nare capable of hurling projectiles of enormous weight. The ships built\r\nafter the _Warrior_ were completely protected by iron plates, and the\r\nthickness of the plates has been increased from time to time, with a\r\nview of resisting the increased power which has been progressively given\r\nto naval guns. A contest, not yet terminated, has been going on between\r\nthe artillerist and the ship-builder; the one endeavouring to make his\r\nguns capable of penetrating with their shot the strongest defensive\r\narmour of the ships, the other adding inch after inch to the thickness\r\nof his plates, in order, if possible, to render his ship invulnerable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 70.—_Section of H.M.S. Hercules._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the finest of the large ironclads is the _Hercules_, of which a\r\nsection amidships is presented on the next page. This ship is 325 ft. in\r\nlength, and 59 ft. in breadth, and is fitted with very powerful engines\r\nwhich will work up to 8,529 indicated horse-power. The tonnage is 5,226;\r\nweight of hull, 4,022 tons; weight of the armour and its backing, 1,690\r\ntons; weight of engines, boilers, and coals, 1,826 tons; total with\r\nequipment and armament, 8,676 tons. Although the _Hercules_ carries this\r\nenormous weight of armour and armament, her speed is very great,\r\nexcelling, in fact, that of any merchant steamer afloat, for she can\r\nsteam at the rate of nearly 17 miles an hour. She also possesses, in a\r\nremarkable degree, the property which naval men call _handiness_; that\r\nis, she can be quickly turned round in a comparatively small space. The\r\nhandiness of a steamer is tested by causing her to steam at full speed\r\nwith the helm hard over, when the vessel will describe a circle. The\r\nsmaller the diameter of that circle, and the shorter the time required\r\nto complete it, the better will the vessel execute the movements\r\nrequired in naval tactics. Comparing the performances of the _Warrior_\r\nand the _Hercules_, we find that the smallest circle the former can\r\ndescribe is 1,050 yards in diameter, and requires nine minutes for its\r\ncompletion, whereas the latter can steam round a circle of only 560\r\nyards diameter in four minutes. The section (Fig. 70) shows that, like\r\nthe _Great Eastern_, the _Hercules_ is constructed with a double hull,\r\nso that she would be safe, even in the event of such an accident as\r\nactually occurred to the _Great Eastern_, when a hole was made by the\r\nstripping off of her bottom plates, 80 ft. long and 5 ft. wide. The\r\ndefensive armour of the _Hercules_ is, it will be observed, greatly\r\nstrengthened near the water-line, where damage to the ship’s side would\r\nbe most fatal. The outer iron plates are here 9 in. thick, while in\r\nother parts the thickness is 8 in., and in the less important positions\r\n6 in. The whole of the hull is, however, completely protected above the\r\nwater-line, and the iron plates are backed up by solid teak-wood for a\r\nthickness of from 10 in. to 12 in. The teak is placed between girders,\r\nwhich are attached to another iron plating 1½ in. thick, supported by\r\ngirders 2 ft. apart. The spaces between these girders are also filled\r\nwith teak, and the whole is lined with an inner skin of iron plating, ¾\r\nin. thick. The belt along the water-line has thus altogether 11¼ in. of\r\niron, of which 9 in. are in one thickness, and this part is, moreover,\r\nbacked by additional layers of teak, as shown in the section; so that,\r\nbesides the 11¼ in. of iron, the ship’s side has here 3 ft. 8 in. total\r\nthickness of solid teak-wood. The deck is also covered with iron plates,\r\nto protect the vessel from vertical fire. The _Hercules_ carries eight\r\n18–ton guns as her central battery, and two 12–ton guns in her bow and\r\nstern: these guns are rifled, and each of the larger ones is capable of\r\nthrowing a shot weighing 400 lbs. The guns can be trained so as to fire\r\nwithin 15° of the direction of the keel; for near the ends of the\r\ncentral battery the ports are indented, and the guns are mounted on\r\nScott’s carriages, in such a manner that any gun-slide can be run on to\r\na small turn-table, and shunted to another port, just as a\r\nrailway-carriage is shunted from one line to another. Targets for\r\nartillery practice were built so as to represent the construction of the\r\nside of the _Hercules_, and it was found, as the result of many\r\nexperiments, that the vessel could not be penetrated by the 600 lb. shot\r\nfrom an Armstrong gun, fired at a distance of 700 yds. The production of\r\nsuch iron plates, and those of even greater thickness which have since\r\nbeen used, forms a striking example of the skill with which iron is\r\nworked. These plates are made by rolling, and it will be understood that\r\nthe machinery used in their formation must be of the most powerful kind,\r\nwhen it is stated that plates from 9 in. to 15 in. thick are formed with\r\na length of 16 ft. and a breadth of 4 ft. The plates are bent, while red\r\nhot, by enormous hydraulic pressure, applied to certain blocks, upon\r\nwhich the plates are laid, the block having a height adjusted according\r\nto the curve required. The operation requires great care, as it must be\r\naccomplished without straining the parts in a manner injurious to the\r\nstrength of the plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 71.—_Section of H.M.S. Inconstant._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 71 on the next page is the section of another ship of war, the\r\n_Inconstant_, which has not, like the _Hercules_, been designed to\r\nwithstand the impact of heavy projectiles, but has been built mainly\r\nwith a view to speed. The _Inconstant_ has only a thin covering of iron\r\nplating, except in that portion of the side which is above water, where\r\nthere is a certain thickness of iron diminishing from the water-line\r\nupwards, but not enough to entitle the _Inconstant_ to be classed as an\r\narmoured vessel. This ship, however, may be a truly formidable\r\nantagonist, for she carries a considerable number of heavy guns, which\r\nher speed would enable her to use with great effect against an adversary\r\nincapable of manœuvring so rapidly. She could give chase, or could run\r\nin and deliver her fire, escaping by her speed from hostile pursuit in\r\ncases where the slower movements of a ponderous ironclad would be much\r\nless effective. The _Inconstant_ carries ten 12–ton guns of 9 in.\r\ncalibre, and six 6–ton 7 in. guns, all rifled muzzle-loaders, mounted on\r\nimproved iron carriages, which give great facilities for handling them\r\nThe ship is a frigate 338 ft. long and 50 ft. broad, with a depth in the\r\nhold of 17 ft. 6 in. She is divided by bulkheads into eleven water-tight\r\ncompartments. The engines are of 6,500 indicated horse-power, and the\r\nvessel attains an average speed of more than 18½ miles per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 72.—_Section, Elevation, and Plan of Turret of H.M.S. Captain._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 73.—_H.M.S. Captain._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA new system of mounting very heavy naval guns was proposed by Captain\r\nColes about 1861. This plan consists in carrying one or two very heavy\r\nguns in a low circular tower or turret, which can be made to revolve\r\nhorizontally by proper machinery. The turret itself is heavily armoured,\r\nso as to be proof against all shot, and is carried on the deck of the\r\nship, which is so arranged that the guns in the turret can be fired at\r\nsmall angles with the keel. The British Admiralty having approved of\r\nCaptain Coles’ plans, two first-class vessels were ordered to be built\r\non the turret system. These were the _Monarch_ and the _Captain_—the\r\nlatter of which we select for description on account of the melancholy\r\ninterest which attaches to her. On page 155 a diagram is given\r\nrepresenting the profile of the _Captain_, in which some of the\r\npeculiarities of the ship are indicated—the turrets with the muzzles of\r\ntwo guns projecting from each being easily recognized. The _Captain_ was\r\n320 ft. long and 53 ft. wide. She was covered with armour plates down to\r\n5 ft. below the water-line, as represented by the dark shading in the\r\ndiagram. The outer plating was 8 in. thick opposite the turrets, and 7\r\nin. thick in other parts. It was backed up by 12 in. of teak; there were\r\ntwo inner skins of iron each ¾ in. thick, then a framework with\r\nlongitudinal girders 10 in. deep. The deck was plated in the spaces\r\nopposite the turrets with iron 1½ in. thick. The _Captain_ was fitted\r\nwith twin screws—that is, instead of having a single screw, one was\r\nplaced on each side, their shafts being, of course, parallel with the\r\nvessel’s length. The object of having two screws was not greater power,\r\nfor it is probable that a single screw would be more effectual in\r\npropelling the ship; but this arrangement was adopted because it was\r\nconsidered that, had only one screw been fixed, the ship might easily be\r\ndisabled by the breaking of a blade or shaft; whereas in the case of\r\nsuch an accident to one of the twin screws, the other would still be\r\navailable. The twin screws could also be used for steering, and the\r\nvessel could be controlled without the rudder, as the engines were quite\r\nindependent of each other, each screw having a separate pair. The\r\ndiameter of the screws was 17 ft. The erections which are shown on the\r\ndeck between the turrets afforded spacious quarters for the officers and\r\nmen. These structures were about half the width of the deck, and tapered\r\noff to a point towards the turrets, so as leave an unimpeded space for\r\ntraining the guns, which could be fired at so small an angle as 6° with\r\nthe length of the vessel. Above these erections, and quite over the\r\nturrets, was another deck, 26 ft. wide, called the “hurricane deck.” The\r\nship was fully rigged and carried a large spread of canvas. But the\r\nspecial features are the revolving turrets, and one of these is\r\nrepresented in detail in Fig. 72, which gives a section, part elevation,\r\nand plan. Of the construction of the turret, and of the mode in which it\r\nwas made to revolve, these drawings convey an idea sufficiently clear to\r\nobviate the necessity of a minute description. Each turret had an\r\noutside diameter of 27 ft., but inside the diameter was only 22 ft. 6\r\nin., the walls being, therefore, 2 ft. 3 in. thick—nearly half this\r\nthickness consisting of iron plating. Separate engines were provided for\r\nturning the turrets, and they could also be turned by men working at the\r\nhandles shown in the figures. Each turret carried two 25–ton Armstrong\r\nguns, capable of receiving a charge of 70 lbs. of gunpowder, and of\r\nthrowing a 600 lb. shot.\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary trials the _Captain_ was sent to sea, and behaved\r\nso well, that Captain Coles and Messrs. Laird, her designer and\r\ncontractors, were perfectly satisfied with her qualities as a sea-going\r\nship. She was then sent in the autumn of 1870 on a cruise with the\r\nfleet, and all went well until a little after midnight between the 6th\r\nand 7th September, 1870, when she suddenly foundered at sea off Cape\r\nFinisterre. The news of this disaster created a profound sensation\r\nthroughout Great Britain, for, with the exception of nineteen persons,\r\nthe whole crew of five hundred persons went down with the ship. Captain\r\nColes, the inventor of the turrets, was in the ill-fated vessel and\r\nperished with the rest, as did also Captain Burgoyne, the gallant\r\ncommander, and the many other distinguished naval officers who had been\r\nappointed to the ship; among the rest was a son of Mr. Childers, then\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty. Although the night on which this\r\nunfortunate ship went down was squally, with rain, and a heavy sea\r\nrunning, the case was not that of an ordinary shipwreck in which a\r\nvessel is overwhelmed by a raging storm. It might be said, indeed, of\r\nthe loss of the _Captain_ as of that of the _Royal George_:\r\n\r\n                       “It was not in the battle;\r\n                       No tempest gave the shock;\r\n                       She sprang no fatal leak;\r\n                       She ran upon no rock.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 74.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 75.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the survivors, Mr. James May, a gunner, related that, shortly\r\nafter midnight he was roused from his sleep by a noise, and feeling the\r\nship uneasy, he dressed, took a light, and went into the after turret,\r\nto see if the guns were all right. He found everything secure in the\r\nturret, but that moment he felt the ship heel steadily over, and a heavy\r\nsea having struck her on the weather side, the water flowed into the\r\nturret, and he got out through the hole in the top of the turret by\r\nwhich the guns were pointed, only to find himself in the water. He swam\r\nto the steam-pinnace, which he saw floating bottom upwards, and there he\r\nwas joined by Captain Burgoyne and a few others. He saw the ship turn\r\nbottom up, and sink stern first, the whole time from her turning over to\r\nsinking not being more than a few minutes. Seeing the launch drifting\r\nwithin a few yards, he called out, “Jump, men! it is your last chance.”\r\nHe jumped, and with three others reached a launch, in which were fifteen\r\npersons, all belonging to the watch on deck, who had found means of\r\ngetting into this boat. One of these had got a footing on the hull of\r\nthe ship as she was turning over, and he actually walked over the bottom\r\nof the vessel, but was washed off by a wave and rescued by those who in\r\nthe meantime had got into the launch. It appears that Captain Burgoyne\r\neither remained on the pinnace or failed to reach the launch. Those who\r\nwere in that boat, finding the captain had not reached them, made an\r\neffort to turn their boat back to pick him up, but the boat was nearly\r\nswamped by the heavy seas, and they were obliged to let her drift. One\r\nman was at this time washed out of the boat and lost, after having but\r\nthe moment before exclaimed, “Now, lads, I think we are all right.”\r\nAfter twelve hours’ hard rowing, without food or water, the survivors,\r\nnumbering sixteen men and petty officers and three boys, reached Cape\r\nFinisterre, where they received help and attention. On their arrival in\r\nEngland, a court-martial was, according to the rules of the service,\r\nformally held on the survivors, but in reality it was occupied in\r\ninvestigating the cause of the catastrophe. The reader may probably be\r\nable to understand what the cause was by giving his attention to some\r\ngeneral considerations, which apply to all ships whatever, and by a\r\ncareful examination of the diagrams, Figs. 74 and 75, which are copied\r\nfrom diagrams that were placed in the hands of the members of the\r\ncourt-martial. The letters b and g and the arrows are, however, added,\r\nto serve in illustration of a part of the explanation. The vessel is\r\nrepresented as heeled over in smooth water, and the gradations on the\r\nsemicircle in Fig. 74 will enable the reader to understand how the heel\r\nis measured by angles. If the ship were upright, the centre line would\r\ncoincide with the upright line, marked o on the semicircle, and drawn\r\nfrom its centre. Suppose a level line drawn through the centre of the\r\nsemicircle, and let the circumference between the point where the last\r\nline cuts it and the point o be divided into ninety equal parts, and let\r\nthese parts be numbered, and straight lines drawn from the centre to\r\neach point of division. In the figure the lines are drawn at every fifth\r\ndivision, and the centre line of the ship coincides with that drawn\r\nthrough the forty-fifth division. In this case the vessel is said to be\r\ninclined, or heeled, at an angle of forty-five degrees, which is usually\r\nwritten 45°. In a position half-way between this and the upright the\r\nangle of heel would be 22½°, and so on. The reader no doubt perceives\r\nthat a ship, like any other body, must be supported, and he is probably\r\naware that the support is afforded by the upward pressure of the water.\r\nHe may also be familiar with the fact that the weight of every body acts\r\nupon it as if the whole weight were concentrated at one certain point,\r\nand that this point is called the centre of gravity of the body.\r\nWhatever may be the position of the body itself, its centre of gravity\r\nremains always at the same point with reference to the body. When the\r\ncentre of gravity happens to be within the solid substance of a body,\r\nthere is no difficulty in thinking of the force of gravitation acting as\r\na downward pull applied at the centre of gravity. But this point is by\r\nno means always within the substance of bodies: as often as not it is in\r\nthe air outside of the body. Thus the centre of gravity of a uniform\r\nring or hoop is in the centre, where, of course, it has no material\r\nconnection with the hoop; but in whatever position the hoop may be\r\nplaced, the earth’s attraction pulls it _as if_ this central point were\r\nrigidly connected with the hoop, and a string were attached to the point\r\nand constantly pulled downwards. This explanation of the meaning of\r\ncentre of gravity may not be altogether superfluous, for, when the\r\ncauses of the loss of the _Captain_ were discussed in the newspapers, it\r\nbecame evident that such terms as “centre of gravity” convey to the\r\nminds of many but very vague notions. One writer in a newspaper enjoying\r\na large circulation seriously attributed the disaster to the\r\ncircumstance of the ship having lost her _centre of gravity_! The upward\r\npressure of water which supports a ship is the same upward pressure\r\nwhich supported the water before the ship was there—that is, supported\r\nthe mass of water which the ship displaces, and which was in size and\r\nshape the exact counterpart of the immersed part of the ship. Now, this\r\nmass of water, considered as a whole, had itself a centre of gravity\r\nthrough which its weight acted downwards, and through which it is\r\nobvious that an equal upward pressure also acted. This centre of gravity\r\nof the displaced water is usually termed the “centre of buoyancy,” and,\r\nunlike the centre of gravity, it changes its position with regard to the\r\nship when the latter is inclined, because then the immersed part becomes\r\nof a shape different for each inclination of the ship. Now, recalling\r\nfor an instant the fundamental law of floating bodies—namely, that the\r\nweight of the water displaced is equal to the weight of the floating\r\nbody—we perceive that in the case of a ship there are two equal forces\r\nacting vertically, viz., the weight of the ship or downward pull of\r\ngravitation acting at G, Fig. 74, the centre of gravity of the ship, and\r\nan equal upward push acting through B, the centre of buoyancy. It is\r\nobvious that the action of these forces concur to turn a ship placed as\r\nin Fig. 74 into the upright position. It is by no means necessary for\r\nthis effect that the centre of gravity should be below the centre of\r\nbuoyancy. All that is requisite for the stability of a ship is, that\r\nwhen the ship is placed out of the upright position, these forces should\r\nact to bring her back, which condition is secured so long as the centre\r\nof buoyancy is nearer to the side towards which the vessel is inclined\r\nthan the centre of gravity is. When there is no other force acting on a\r\nship or other floating body, these two points are always in the same\r\nvertical line. The two equal forces thus applied in parallel directions\r\nconstitute what is called in mechanics a “couple,” and the effect of\r\nthis in turning the ship back into the upright position is the same as\r\nif a force equal to its weight were applied at the end of a lever equal\r\nin length to the horizontal distance between the lines through B and G.\r\nThe righting force, then, increases in proportion to the horizontal\r\ndistance between the two points, and it is measured by multiplying the\r\nweight of the ship in tons by the number of feet between the verticals\r\nthrough G and B, the product being expressed in statical foot-tons, and\r\nrepresenting the weight in tons which would have to be applied to the\r\nend of a lever 1 ft. long, in order to produce the same turning effect.\r\nWhen a ship is kept steadily heeled over by a side wind, the pressure of\r\nthe wind and the resistance of the water through which the vessel moves\r\nconstitute another couple exactly balancing the righting couple. The\r\nmoment of the righting couple, or the righting force, or statical\r\nstability as it is also called, is determined by calculation and\r\nexperiment from the design of the ship, and from her behaviour when a\r\nknown weight is placed in her at a known distance from the centre. Such\r\ncalculations and experiments were made in the case of the _Captain_, but\r\ndo not appear to have been conducted with sufficient care and\r\ncompleteness to exhibit her deficiency in stability. After the loss of\r\nthe ship, however, elaborate computations on these points were made from\r\nthe plans and other data. The following table gives some of the results,\r\nwith the corresponding particulars concerning the _Monarch_ for the sake\r\nof comparison:\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐\r\n │                                               │_Monarch._│_Captain._│\r\n ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┤\r\n │  I.

Any\r\nfurther heeling would have brought the points into the position shown in\r\nFig. 75, where it is obvious that the action of the forces is now to\r\nturn the vessel still more on its side, and the result is an upsetting\r\ncouple instead of a righting couple.\r\n\r\nThese figures and considerations refer to the case of the vessel\r\nfloating in smooth water, but the case of a vessel floating on a wave is\r\nnot different in principle. The reader may picture to himself the\r\ndiagrams inclined so that the water-line may represent a portion of the\r\nwave’s surface; then he must remember that the very action which heaves\r\nup the water in a sloping surface is so compounded with gravity, that\r\nthe forces acting through G and B retain nearly the same position\r\nrelatively to the surface as before.\r\n\r\nNo. VI. in the foregoing table requires some explanation. To heel a ship\r\nover to a certain angle a certain amount of _work_ must be done, and in\r\nthe scientific sense _work_ is done only when something is moved through\r\na space against a resistance. When the weight of a ton is raised 1 ft.\r\nhigh, one foot ton of work is said to be done; if 2 tons were raised 1\r\nft., or 1 ton were raised 2 ft., then two foot-tons of work would be\r\ndone, and so on. The same would be the case if a pressure equal to those\r\nweights were applied so as to move a thing in any direction through the\r\nsame distances. It should be carefully noticed that the foot-ton is\r\nquite a different unit in this case from what it is as the moment of a\r\ncouple. If we heel a ship over by applying a pressure on the masts, it\r\nis plain that the pressure must act through a certain space, and the\r\nsame heel could be caused either by means of a smaller pressure or a\r\ngreater, according as we apply it higher up or lower down; but the space\r\nthrough which it must act would vary, so that the product of the\r\npressure and space would, however, be always the same. No. VI. shows the\r\namount of work that would have to be done in order completely to upset\r\neach of the vessels when already steadily heeled over to 14°. The\r\namounts in the two cases are so different that we can easily understand\r\nhow a squall which would not endanger the _Monarch_ might throw the\r\n_Captain_ over. A squall suddenly springing up would do more than heel a\r\nvessel over to the angle at which it is able to maintain it: it would\r\nswing it beyond that position by reason of the work done on the sails as\r\nthey are moving over with the vessel, and the latter would come to a\r\nsteady angle of heel only after a series of oscillations. Squalls,\r\nagain, which, although suddenly springing up in this manner, could not\r\nheel the ship over beyond the angle where the stability vanishes, might\r\nyet do so if they were intermittent and should happen to coincide in\r\ntime with the oscillations of the ship—just as a series of very small\r\nimpulses, coinciding with the time of the vibrations of a heavy\r\npendulum, may accumulate so as to increase the range of vibration to any\r\nextent. It is believed that in the case of the _Captain_ the pressure of\r\nthe wind on the underside of the hurricane assisted in upsetting the\r\nvessel. This, however, could only have exerted a very small effect\r\ncompared to that produced by the sails. The instability of the _Captain_\r\ndoes not appear to have been discovered by such calculations as were\r\nmade before the vessel went to sea. It was observed, however, that the\r\nship when afloat was 1 ft. 6 in. deeper in the water than she should\r\nhave been—in other words, the freeboard, or side of the ship out of the\r\nwater, instead of being 8 ft. high as intended, was only 6 ft. 6 in.,\r\nand such a difference would have a great effect on the stability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 76.—_H.M.S. Glatton._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe turret system has been applied to other ships on quite a different\r\nplan. Of these the _Glatton_ is one of the most remarkable. Her\r\nappearance is very singular, and totally unlike that which we look for\r\nin a ship, as may be seen by an inspection of Fig. 76, page 162. The\r\n_Glatton_, which was launched in 1871, is of the _Monitor_ class, and\r\nwas designed by Mr. E. J. Reed, who has sought to give the ship the most\r\ncomplete protection. With this view the hull is covered with iron plates\r\nbelow the water-line, and the deck also is cased with 3 in. iron plates,\r\nto resist shot or shell falling vertically. The base of the turret is\r\nshielded by a massive breastwork, which is a peculiarity of this ship.\r\nThe large quantity of iron required for all these extra defences has, of\r\ncourse, the effect of increasing the immersion of the vessel, and\r\ntherefore of diminishing her speed. The freeboard when the ship is in\r\nordinary trim is only 3 ft. high, and means are provided for admitting\r\nwater to the lowest compartment, so as to increase the immersion by 1\r\nft., thus reducing the freeboard to only 2 ft. when the vessel is in\r\nfighting trim, leaving only that small portion of the hull above water\r\nas a mark for the enemy. The water ballast can be pumped out when no\r\nlonger needed. The _Glatton_ is 245 ft. long and 54 ft. broad, and she\r\ndraws 19 ft. of water with the freeboard of 3 ft., displacing 4,865 tons\r\nof water, while, with the 2 ft. freeboard, the displacement is 5,179\r\ntons. This ship cost £210,000. Mr. Reed wished to construct a vessel of\r\nmuch larger size on the same plan—a proposal to which, however, the\r\nAdmiralty did not then consent. The _Glatton_ is, nevertheless, one of\r\nthe most powerful ships of war ever built, and may be considered as an\r\nimpregnable floating fortress. Above the water-line the hull is covered\r\nwith armour plates 12 in. thick, supported by 20 in. of teak backing,\r\nand an inner layer of iron 1 in. thick. Below the water-line the iron is\r\n8 in. thick, and the teak 10 in. The revolving turret carries two 25–ton\r\nguns, firing each a 600 lb. shot, and is covered by a massive plating of\r\niron 14 in. in thickness. Besides this the base of the turret is\r\nprotected by a breastwork rising 6 ft. above the hull. This breastwork\r\nis formed of plates 12 in. thick, fastened on 18 in. of teak. The turret\r\nrises 7 ft. above the breastwork, and therefore the latter in no way\r\nimpedes the working of the guns. The _Glatton_ has a great advantage\r\nover all the other turret ships in having a perfectly unimpeded fore\r\nrange for her guns, for there is no mast or other object to prevent the\r\nguns being fired directly over the bow. There are no sails, the mast\r\nbeing intended only for flying signals and hoisting up boats, &c. The\r\nhull is divided by vertical partitions into nine water-tight\r\ncompartments, and also into three horizontal flats—the lowest being\r\nair-tight, and having arrangements for the admission and removal of\r\nwater, as already mentioned. The stem of the ship is protruded forwards\r\nbelow the water for about 8 ft., thus forming a huge ram which would\r\nitself render the _Glatton_ a truly formidable antagonist at close\r\nquarters even if her guns were not used. The engines are capable of\r\nbeing worked up to 3,000 horse-power, giving the ship a speed of 9½\r\nknots per hour, and means are provided for turning the turret by steam\r\npower. The turret can be rotated by manual labour, requiring about three\r\nminutes for its complete revolution, but by steam power the operation\r\ncan be effected in half a minute. The commander communicates his orders\r\nfrom the pilot-house on the hurricane deck to the engine-room,\r\nsteering-house, and turret, by means of speaking-tubes and electric\r\ntelegraphs. The _Glatton_ was not designed to be ocean-going, but is\r\nintended for coast defence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 77.—_H.M.S. Thunderer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe British navy contains two powerful turret-ships constructed on the\r\nsame general plan as the _Glatton_, but larger, and capable of steaming\r\nat a greater speed, and of carrying coal for a long voyage. These sister\r\nships are named the _Devastation_, Fig. 69, and the _Thunderer_, Fig.\r\n77. The _Thunderer_ has two turrets and a freeboard of 4 ft. 6 in. Space\r\nis provided for a store of 1,800 tons of coal, of which the _Glatton_\r\ncan carry only 500 tons. The vessel is fitted with twin screws, turned\r\nby two pairs of independent engines, capable of working up to 5,600\r\nhorse-power, and she can steam at the rate of 12 knots, or nearly 14\r\nmiles, an hour. With the large supply of coal she can carry, the\r\n_Thunderer_ could make a voyage of 3,000 miles without re-coaling.\r\nThough the freeboard of the heavily-plated hull is only 4 ft. 6 in., a\r\nlighter iron superstructure, indicated in the figure by the light\r\nshading, rises from the deck to the height of 7 ft., making the real\r\nfreeboard nearly 12 ft. This gives the ship much greater stability, and\r\nprevents her from rolling heavily when at sea. The length is 285 ft. and\r\nthe width 58 ft., and the draught 26 ft. The hull is double, the\r\ndistance between the outer and inner skins of the bottom being 4 ft. 6\r\nin. The framing is very strong and on the longitudinal principle, and\r\nthe keel is formed of Bessemer steel. Each turret is 24 ft. 3 in. in\r\ninternal diameter, and is built with five layers of teak and iron.\r\nBeginning at the inside, there is a lining of 2⅝ in. iron plates; then 6\r\nin. of teak in iron frames, arranged horizontally; 6 in. of armour\r\nplates; 9 in. of teak, placed vertically; outside of all, 8 in. armour\r\nplates. Each turret carries two Fraser 35–ton guns, rifled\r\nmuzzle-loaders. The turrets revolve by hand or by steam-power. There are\r\nno sails, and thus a clear range for the guns is afforded fore and aft.\r\nThe bases of the turrets are protected by the armoured breastwork, of\r\nwhich a portion is seen in the figure in advance of the fore turret.\r\n\r\nAnother very powerful ship of war, which possesses some special\r\nfeatures, is represented in the diagram on page 165, Fig. 78. This\r\nvessel, named the _König Wilhelm_, was built at Blackwall for the\r\nPrussian Government by the Thames Ironworks and Steam Shipbuilding\r\nCompany, from designs by Mr. Reed. Her length is 365 ft., width 60 ft.;\r\nburthen, 6,000 tons; displacement, 8,500 tons. She is framed\r\nlongitudinally, that is, girders pass from end to end, about 7 ft.\r\napart, and the stem projects into a pointed ram. In this case also the\r\nhull is double; there is, in fact, one hull within another, with a space\r\nof 4½ ft. between them. The armour plates are 8 in. in thickness, with\r\n10 in. of teak backing; but on the less important parts the thickness of\r\nthe iron is reduced to 6 in., and in some places to 4 in. This ship has\r\na broadside battery, and there are no turrets, but on the deck there\r\nare, fore and aft, two semicircular shields, formed of iron plates and\r\nteak, pierced with port-holes for cannon, and also with loop-holes for\r\nmuskets. From these a fore-and-aft fire may be kept up. The ship is\r\nfully rigged, and has also steam engines of 7,000 horse-power, by\r\nMaudslay and Co. Her armament consists of four three-hundred-pounders,\r\ncapable of delivering fore-and-aft as well as broadside fire, and\r\ntwenty-three other guns of the same size between decks. These guns are\r\nall Krupp’s steel breech-loaders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 78.—_The König Wilhelm._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 78_a_.—_The “Victoria” leaving Newcastle-on-Tyne._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe great contest of armour plates _versus_ guns has already been\r\nalluded to, and to the remarks then made it may be added that, while on\r\nthe one hand, guns weighing 110 tons are mounted in turrets, ships are\r\nalready designed with 18 in. and even 20 in. of steel armour plates. It\r\nwould be very difficult to predict which side will sooner reach the\r\nlimit beyond which increase of size and power cannot go. The gradual\r\nincrease of thickness of plating, attended by increased weight of guns,\r\nprojectiles, and charges of powder, may be illustrated by stating in a\r\ncondensed form a few details of some ships, as regards the thickness of\r\narmour, and its resisting power, which is nearly in proportion to the\r\nsquare of its thickness; and also some particulars respecting the guns\r\noriginally carried by those ships.\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐\r\n │              │_Warrior._│  _Her-   │_Glatton._│  _Thun-  │  _Vic-   │\r\n │              │          │ cules._  │          │ derer._  │ toria._  │\r\n ├──────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤\r\n │Date when     │   1861   │   1868   │   1872   │   1877   │   1889   │\r\n │  completed   │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │Thickness of  │    4½    │    9     │    12    │    14    │    18    │\r\n │  iron plating│          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │  in inches   │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │Relative      │    20    │    81    │   144    │   196    │   324    │\r\n │  resisting   │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │  power of    │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │  plating     │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │Guns carried  │Cast iron,│ Wrought  │ Wrought  │ Wrought  │  Steel,  │\r\n │              │  smooth  │  iron,   │  iron,   │  iron,   │  Rifled  │\r\n │              │   bore   │  rifled  │  rifled  │  rifled  │          │\r\n │Weight of guns│    4¾    │    18    │    25    │    35    │   111    │\r\n │  in tons     │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │Charge of     │    16    │    60    │    70    │   120    │   960    │\r\n │  powder in   │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │  lbs.        │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │Weight of     │    68    │   400    │   600    │   700    │  1,800   │\r\n │  projectiles │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │  in lbs.     │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │Destructive   │   452    │  3,863   │  5,165   │  8,404   │  56,000  │\r\n │  power of    │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │  projectiles │          │          │          │          │          │\r\n │  in foot-tons│          │          │          │          │          │\r\n └──────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\nOne of the latest additions out of the thirty or forty armoured ships\r\nthat have been added to the British Navy since the preceding pages were\r\nwritten is included in the above table for the sake of comparison. Our\r\nironclad fleet now includes vessels protected and armed in many\r\ndifferent ways. Some have the protective armour extended continuously\r\nalong the water-line, others have it for only a greater or less part of\r\ntheir length. The armaments are also very diverse as to the size of the\r\nguns and the way in which they are mounted. A few carry one or two of\r\nthe huge 110–ton gun mounted in massive revolving turrets; others have\r\ntheir guns in central batteries, or in _barbettes_, and others again are\r\narranged as broadside ships; while these plans are also variously\r\ncombined so as to form a great number of different types. In the ships\r\nbuilt within the last 15 years, steel has been almost invariably used\r\ninstead of iron for the armour-plating. A great increase of speed has\r\nbeen obtained in late years. The largest British armoured ships yet\r\nlaunched have displacements between 10,000 and 12,000 tons, but another\r\nclass of first-rate line-of-battle ships of still greater size is in\r\nprocess of construction, and of these it is estimated that four will be\r\ncompleted in 1893. They are all of the same design and armament, and\r\nwill have a displacement of 14,150 tons, a length of 380 feet, and a\r\nbreadth of 75 feet. The armour plates at the sides will be 18 inches\r\nthick. Each ship will carry four 67–ton breech loading rifled guns, ten\r\n6–inch quick firing guns, and 18 other smaller guns, also quick firing.\r\nThese vessels are expected to realize a speed of about 20 miles per\r\nhour; but this is somewhat less than a few of the heavy ironclads now\r\nafloat have given by actual trial, a rate equal to 21⅓ miles an hour\r\nhaving been attained by some. Several of our rapid unarmoured cruisers\r\nare able to steam at 25 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of 1894, the British navy possessed no fewer than eight\r\nof the largest armoured line of battle-ships mentioned in the foregoing\r\nparagraph, each being of 14,150 tons displacement, and having engines of\r\n13,000 horse-power. At the same period there were in course of\r\nconstruction four ships surpassing even these in tonnage, though of\r\nsomewhat less engine-power. Two were building at Portsmouth, to be\r\ncalled the _Majestic_ and the _Royal George_, whilst the _Jupiter_ was\r\nin progress at Glasgow and the _Mars_ at Birkenhead. All these are very\r\nheavily armoured vessels, each displacing 14,900 tons, provided with\r\nengines of 12,000 horse-power, and a very effective armament of guns.\r\nAmong the powerful ships of the navy may now also be noted the _Blake_,\r\nthe _Blenheim_, which, although the displacement is only 500 tons\r\ngreater than that of _König Wilhelm_, have engines of nearly three times\r\nthe power, namely, of 20,000 horse-power. Of large armoured ships,\r\nnamely, those of _9,000 tons and upwards_, Great Britain now has afloat\r\nat least fifty; and the advance that has taken place in the size and\r\npower of war-ships during the last twenty years may be inferred by\r\nreference to the foregoing paragraphs giving the dimensions, &c., of the\r\n_Glatton_ and the _Thunderer_, which paragraphs are, for the sake of\r\ncomparison, allowed to appear as they did in the first edition (1876) of\r\nthis book. Besides these very large armoured vessels, of which the\r\nsmallest is nearly twice as big as the largest of twenty-five years ago,\r\nthe British navy comprises ships of every size and for every purpose,\r\nand so many of them that their names and classifications would occupy\r\nmany pages.\r\n\r\nTwo recent additions representing new type of ships claim notice before\r\nthis article is concluded. These are first the _Terrible_, with a sister\r\nship the _Powerful_. The former, of which a representation[3] is given\r\nin Plate V., is pronounced, for its size, armour, armament, and speed\r\ntaken together, to be the most powerful cruiser in the world. The length\r\nis 538 ft., breadth 71 ft., depth 43 ft., and the displacement is 14,250\r\ntons. A special object in the design of this vessel was high speed, and\r\nshe is provided with twin-screws and two engines, the combined effort of\r\nwhich is equal to 25,000 horse-power. There are forty-eight boilers and\r\nfour funnels, the ship being capable of carrying 3,000 tons of coal. The\r\nvessel is built on the lines of the great Atlantic steamers, and the\r\nengines, guns, and magazines are protected by a thick curved armour\r\ndeck. The vessel has a speed of 22 knots, or 25⅓ miles per hour. Her\r\narmament consists of two 22–ton guns, twelve 6–in. quick-firing, and\r\nmany other smaller machine guns, and she carries besides four submerged\r\ntorpedo tubes. A second ship to be noted is amongst those designed\r\nmainly to exceed all other craft in speed, and ranging in tonnage from\r\n3,800 to 4,500. The _Janus_, a torpedo-boat destroyer of this class, was\r\nfound, at a recent trial over a measured mile, to attain the then\r\nunexampled speed of 28 knots, or 32¼ miles per hour. But even this has\r\nbeen beaten by a new torpedo-boat destroyer, built by Messrs. Yarrow at\r\nPoplar for the Russian Government, and launched in August, 1895. This\r\nvessel, within a few hours after leaving the stocks, cut through the\r\nwater at the rate of 30·285 knots, or nearly 35 miles, per hour.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  From _Graphic_, 1st June, 1895.\r\n\r\nA sad fate befell the _Victoria_, which was one of the heaviest armed of\r\nBritish ships (_vide_ page 129), when taking part in some naval\r\nmanœuvres off Tripoli, on the Syrian coast, where she was the flag-ship\r\nof Admiral Tryon, commander-in-chief of the squadron. On the 22nd June,\r\n1893, in consequence of an inconsiderate order given by the admiral\r\nhimself, the _Victoria_ was struck by the formidable ram of the\r\n_Camperdown_ (10,600), and in fifteen minutes turned over and sank in\r\nsight of the whole fleet, carrying down with her the admiral, 30\r\nofficers, and 320 men, out of a crew of 600.

But it has been pointed out by some historians that the\r\nintroduction of gunpowder into Europe brought about the downfall of the\r\nfeudal system with its attendant evils. In those days every man was\r\npractically a soldier: the bow or the sword he inherited from his father\r\nmade him ready for the fray. But when cannons, muskets, and mines began\r\nto be used, the art of war became more difficult. The simple possession\r\nof arms did not render men soldiers, but a long special training was\r\nrequired. The greater cost of the new arms also contributed to change\r\nthe arrangements of society. Standing armies were established, and war\r\nbecame the calling of only a small part of the inhabitants of a country,\r\nwhile the majority were left free to devote themselves to civil\r\nemployments. Then the useful arts of life received more attention,\r\ninventions were multiplied, commerce began to be considered as\r\nhonourable an avocation as war, letters were cultivated, and other\r\nfoundations laid for modern science. If such have really been the\r\nindirect results of the invention of gunpowder, we shall hardly share\r\nthe regret of the fine gentleman in “Henry IV.”:\r\n\r\n              “That it was great pity, so it was,\r\n              That villanous saltpetre should be digged\r\n              Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,\r\n              Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed\r\n              So cowardly.”\r\n\r\nWe often hear people regretting that so much attention and ingenuity as\r\nare shown by the weapons of the present day should have been expended\r\nupon implements of destruction. It would not perhaps be difficult to\r\nshow that if we must have wars, the more effective the implements of\r\ndestruction, the shorter and more decisive will be the struggles, and\r\nthe less the total loss of life, though occurring in a shorter time.\r\nThen, again, the exasperated and savage feelings evoked by the\r\nhand-to-hand fighting under the old system have less opportunity for\r\ntheir exercise in modern warfare, which more resembles a game of skill.\r\nBut the wise and the good have in all ages looked forward to a time when\r\nsword and spear shall be everywhere finally superseded by the\r\nploughshare and the reaping-hook, and the whole human race shall dwell\r\ntogether in amity. Until that happy time arrives—\r\n\r\n  “Till the war-drum throbs no longer, and the battle flags are furl’d\r\n  In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world—\r\n  When the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,\r\n  And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law,”—\r\n\r\nwe may consider that the more costly and ingenious and complicated the\r\nimplements of war become, the more certain will be the extension and the\r\npermanence of civilization. The great cost of such appliances as those\r\nwe are about to describe, the ingenuity needed for their contrivance,\r\nthe elaborate machinery required for their production, and the skill\r\nimplied in their use, are such that these weapons can never be the arms\r\nof other than wealthy and intelligent nations. We know that in ancient\r\ntimes opulent and civilized communities could hardly defend themselves\r\nagainst poor and barbarous races. But the world cannot again witness\r\nsuch a spectacle as Rome presented when the savage hordes of Alaric\r\nswarmed through her gates, and the mighty civilization of centuries fell\r\nunder the assaults of the northern barbarians. In our day it is the poor\r\nand barbarous tribes who are everywhere at the mercy of the wealthy and\r\ncultivated nations. The present age has been so remarkably fertile in\r\nwarlike inventions, that it may truthfully be said that the progress\r\nmade in fire-arms and war-ships within the second half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury surpasses everything that had been previously accomplished from\r\nthe time gunpowder came into use. Englishmen have good reason to be\r\nproud of the position taken by their country, and may feel assured that\r\nher armaments will enable her to hold her own among the most advanced\r\nnations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe subject of fire-arms embraces a very wide ground, as will appear if\r\nwe consider the many different forms in which these weapons are\r\nconstructed in order best to serve particular purposes. Pertaining to\r\nthis subject, attention must also be directed to the modern projectiles\r\nand to the newer explosives that have largely taken the place of\r\nordinary gunpowder. The shot gun, fowling-piece, and sporting rifle\r\nproperly come under the head of fire-arms, and in the march of\r\nimprovement these forms have most commonly been in advance of military\r\nmuskets and rifles, the ingenuity bestowed on all their details being\r\nworthy of admiration. Nevertheless it is to the implements of war that\r\ngeneral interest attaches; for on them depends so much the fate of\r\nbattles and the destiny of nations, that whenever any country is engaged\r\nin war the question of arms becomes one of surpassing importance,\r\nenlisting the patriotic instincts of every citizen. Hence in the\r\nfollowing pages our space will be devoted mainly to weapons of war, and\r\nmore particularly to those that have been adopted by our own country.\r\n\r\nEveryone of course is aware that guns, cannon, and gunpowder are by no\r\nmeans inventions of the nineteenth century; but there are fewer\r\nacquainted with the fact that rifling, breech-loading, machine guns, and\r\nrevolvers were all invented and tried hundreds of years before. The\r\ndevices by which some of these ideas were sought to be realised in past\r\nages appear to us in some instances very primitive, not to say childish,\r\nwhen compared with modern work: but it must be remembered that nearly\r\nall the appliances required for producing such weapons had themselves to\r\nwait for their invention until the nineteenth century; such, for\r\ninstance, as the steam-hammer, powerful and accurate tools, refined\r\nmeasuring implements, material entirely reliable such as the new steel,\r\nand also scientific investigations of all the conditions involved. The\r\nmilitary fire-arms are of so many different forms and patterns that we\r\ncan deal here with but a selection from the various services. If a rough\r\nclassification had to be made, the most obvious distinction would be\r\nbetween the weapons the soldier carries in his hands (small-arms) and\r\nthose which are mounted on some kind of carriage and discharge\r\nprojectiles of much greater weight (ordnance). Ordnance again includes\r\nguns mounted on forts, carried in ships, or taken with an army into the\r\nfield, in each case coming into action under different conditions.\r\nPartaking somewhat of the nature of both field-guns and of small-arms\r\nare the machine guns, of which the French mitrailleur was the first\r\nexample, afterwards developing into much more effective weapons in the\r\nhands of Gatling, Gardner, Nordenfelt, Maxim, and Hotchkiss.\r\n\r\nAs much will have to be said about _rifling_ the bores of muskets and\r\ncannon, we may here explain the nature and object of this device. The\r\nprojectiles used in all guns down to comparatively recent times were\r\nalmost invariably of spherical form, and could indeed scarcely be\r\notherwise with smooth-bore weapons. As the diameter of the shot would\r\nnecessarily be something less than that of the bore of the barrel, a\r\nconsiderable loss of power would result from the escape of the powder\r\ngases between the shot and the barrel, which escape is known as\r\n_windage_. Another disadvantage of the spherical projectile is that for\r\nthe same weight of metal the air offers a greater resistance to its\r\npassage, and consequently checks its speed more quickly than that of any\r\nother circular form; for the air resistance is proportional to the\r\nsquare of the diameter, and therefore if we take a ball of 1 in.\r\ndiameter and a cylinder of 1 in. in length, each having the same weight\r\nof metal, the diameter of the cylindrical shot will be a little more\r\nthan four-fifths of an inch, and the air resistance to the ball will be\r\nexactly half as much again as to the cylinder, that is, in the\r\nproportion of 3 to 2. Again, the passage of the spherical shot within\r\nthe barrel of the gun will not be in a straight line, but in a series of\r\nrebounds from side to side, and its direction on leaving the muzzle will\r\ndepend upon which part of the bore it just before impinges on, as from\r\nthat it will also take a rotatory “twist” that will in part determine\r\nits path through the air.\r\n\r\nNow if an elongated projectile were fired from a smooth-bore gun, its\r\ncourse through the air would be erratic to a degree impossible to the\r\nspherical shot, for it would turn end over end with deviations that\r\nwould make aiming impracticable. But if the elongated projectile is made\r\nto spin rapidly enough about its longitudinal axis, it flies through the\r\nair quite steadily, the axis of rotation remaining parallel to that of\r\nthe gun throughout the whole flight. The steadiness due to rapid\r\nrotation has familiar examples in spinning tops, in gyroscopic tops, in\r\nthe way arrows are feathered so that the air may cause them to revolve\r\naxially, and so on. The axial rotation of the projectile is effected by\r\nploughing out in the cylindrical barrel of the gun a number of spiral or\r\ntwisting grooves, which the projectile is compelled to follow as it\r\ntravels along the barrel, either by means of corresponding protuberances\r\nformed upon its surface in the first instance, as in Jacob’s bullets, or\r\nby studs let into it, as in the studded shots and shells for ordnance\r\nwhich constituted at one time the regulation plan adopted by the British\r\nGovernment; or otherwise by making the force of the explosion expand\r\nsome portion of the projectile in such a manner that this portion shall\r\ncompletely fill up the grooves, thus preventing windage, and causing the\r\nprojectile to follow the twist of the grooves. This is the more general\r\nmethod, especially since the adoption of breech-loading. The Lancaster\r\nrifling, and that advocated by Whitworth, are the same in principle, but\r\ndiffer in appearance, from the section of the barrel being made in the\r\none case oval, in the other hexagonal or polygonal, but with the twist\r\nnecessary to produce rotation.\r\n\r\nIncident to the discharge of all fire-arms, great and small, is a\r\nphenomenon of which we have to speak, because it is one which in the\r\nmounting of heavy ordnance especially has to be taken into account. And\r\nas it also illustrates in a very direct way one of the most general laws\r\nof nature, while people often have very vague and erroneous ideas of its\r\ncause and operation, it deserves the reader’s attention. In gunnery it\r\nis called the _recoil_, and is familiar to anyone who has ever fired a\r\npistol, fowling-piece, or rifle, in the kick backwards felt at the\r\nmoment of the discharge. This law is in operation whenever the condition\r\nof a body in respect to its rest or motion is changing. That is,\r\nwhenever a body at rest has motion given to, or if when already moving\r\nit is made to go faster or slower, or to stop, or when the direction of\r\nthe motion is changed from that in a straight line. Now although these\r\nchanges or actions are frequently occurring before our eyes, the\r\noperation in them of Newton’s third law of motion does not generally\r\npresent itself to common observation. This third law was stated by Sir\r\nIsaac Newton thus:—“To every action there is always an opposite and\r\nequal reaction.” Now the expanding gases due to the gunpowder explosion\r\npress the bullet forwards and the barrel (with its attachments)\r\nbackwards, with the same pressure in both cases, but at the end of the\r\nbullet’s passage along the bore the same velocity is not imparted to the\r\ntwo bodies, because the same pressure acting for the same time on bodies\r\nof unequal _mass_ always produces velocities that are inversely\r\nproportional to the _masses_. The reader should try to acquire this\r\nconception of _mass_, remarking that it is a something quite distinct\r\nfrom that of _weight_. A given lump of metal, for instance, would have\r\nexactly the same _mass_ in any part of the universe, whereas its weight\r\nwould depend upon its position; as, for instance, at the distance from\r\nthe earth of the moon’s orbit, it would _weigh_ only as 1/3600th part of\r\nits weight at the earth’s surface, and if it could be carried to the\r\nvery centre of the earth it would there have no weight at all. Though\r\nthe lump of metal will have different weights at different parts of the\r\nearth’s surface, it has been found (by experiment) that the weights of\r\nbodies at any one place are proportional to their masses. Therefore the\r\nsame numbers that express the weights of bodies might also express their\r\nmasses; but for certain good reasons these quantities are referred to\r\ndifferent units. In England a piece of metal weighing 32 lbs. under\r\nstandard conditions is said to have mass = 1; and so on. As with the\r\n_same pressure acting for the same time_, the velocities imparted are\r\ninversely proportional to the masses, it follows that the number\r\nexpressing the velocity multiplied by that representing the mass in each\r\nsuch case of action and reaction will give the same product, or in other\r\nwords the _amount of motion_ (momentum) will be the same. This is what\r\nNewton meant by saying the reaction is _equal_ to the action. We may now\r\nby way of illustration calculate the velocity of recoil of a rifle under\r\nconditions similar to those that might occur in practice. Let us suppose\r\nthat the rifle, including the stock and all attachments, weighs 10 lbs.,\r\nand that from it is fired a bullet weighing one-sixteenth of a pound,\r\nwith a velocity at the muzzle of 1,200 ft. per second. To obtain the\r\namount of motion or the momentum, we should here multiply the number\r\nexpressing the _mass_ of the bullet by 1,200, but for our present\r\npurpose the weight numbers may be used for the sake of simplicity;\r\ntherefore 1/16 x 1,200 = 75 will represent (proportionately) the forward\r\nmomentum of the bullet, and according to Newton’s law the backward\r\nmomentum of the rifle will be, on the same scale, 75 also. We must\r\ntherefore find the number which multiplied by 10 will give 75, and this\r\nobviously is 7·5. That is as much as to say that at the instant the\r\nbullet is leaving the muzzle, the rifle itself, _if free to move_, would\r\nbe moving backward at the speed of 7½ ft. per second. Observe that this\r\nresult would be the same if the rifle were fired where weight is\r\nnon-existent; nor is the recoil due, as sometimes is erroneously\r\nsupposed, to the resistance of the air to the passage of the bullet\r\nalong the barrel, for even if the air were abolished, the recoil, so far\r\nas due to the masses and velocities, would remain the same, as indeed\r\nmay be seen from the fact of our calculation taking no account of the\r\nbore of the rifle or of the shape of the bullet, circumstances of the\r\nutmost importance where atmospheric resistance is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing calculation however involves an assumption not in exact\r\nconformity with actual conditions, by taking for granted that the\r\n_centre of gravity_ of the rifle is in the line of the axis of the\r\nbarrel, while in fact this centre is almost always lower, and therefore\r\nthe kick of the recoil acts in part as a turning-over push, tending to\r\ntilt up the muzzle of the gun, and for that reason the firer must hold\r\nthe weapon very firmly or he will miss his aim. When such a rifle as we\r\nhave supposed is fired, say from the shoulder, it would follow from the\r\nabove calculation that the backward kick of the recoil is equivalent to\r\na blow from a 10–lb. weight moving at the speed of 7½ ft. per second.\r\nThis would certainly be a very uncomfortable experience, but the\r\nbackward momentum must be met somehow. We have supposed that the gun is\r\nfree to move, but we know the firer presses it firmly against the\r\nmuscles of his shoulder, and the stock of the gun is spread out and\r\nprovided with a smooth hollow heel plate, so that any pressure from it\r\nis felt as little as possible, especially as the muscle against which it\r\nis applied acts as an elastic pad. With the rifle thus firmly held we\r\nmay regard the marksman and his rifle as forming only _one mass_, and\r\nthe centre of gravity of this being now much below the axis of the\r\nbarrel, the effect of the recoil tends to overthrow the man backwards;\r\nbut he learns to resist this by standing firmly, so that the elasticity\r\nof his whole frame comes into play; and besides this, the mass factor of\r\nthe momentum being now so large, the velocity factor becomes\r\ncomparatively insignificant.\r\n\r\nAlthough the momenta of gun and projectile are, according to Newton’s\r\nlaw, _equal_ and opposite, the case is very different with regard to\r\ntheir _energies_, or powers of doing work, for the measure of these is\r\njointly mass and _the square of the velocity_. The _energy_ (_vis viva_)\r\nof a body of weight in pounds = W, moving with the velocity of v feet\r\nper second is always Wv^2/64·4, that is, it will do this number of\r\nfoot-lbs. units of work before it comes to rest. It would require too\r\nmuch space to demonstrate and fully explain here what this means, but\r\nthe reader may refer to our index under the entries “Energy” and “Work,”\r\nor to any modern elementary treatise on dynamics. If the calculation be\r\nmade of the energies of the ball and of the rifle due to our calculated\r\nvelocities of recoil, it will be found that that of the ball is 160\r\ntimes greater than that of the other, and the ball possesses this energy\r\nin a much smaller compass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 80.—_Trajectory of a Projectile._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe course or track of a projectile through the air after it leaves the\r\ngun is called the _trajectory_, and this has been studied both\r\nexperimentally and theoretically, with interesting results. Assuming\r\nthat the shot passed through empty space, or that the air offered no\r\nresistance to its passage, it would be very easy to trace the path of a\r\nprojectile. Let us suppose that Fig. 80 represents a gun elevated at a\r\nhigh angle. The moment the projectile leaves the muzzle, gravity begins\r\nto act upon it, causing it to move vertically downwards with\r\never-increasing velocity until it finally reaches the ground; the onward\r\nuniform movement parallel to the axis of the piece being continued all\r\nthe time. We could find the position of the projectile at the end of\r\nsuccessive equal periods of time by drawing a straight line AC, a\r\nprolongation of the axis of the piece, or a line of the same\r\ninclination; on this we mark off equal distances representing by scale\r\nthe velocity of the projectile per second, the points B, C, D, E being\r\nthe positions the projectile would be in at the end of each successive\r\nsecond if gravity did not act. In order to bring the diagram within\r\nmoderate compass, we suppose the projectile to have only the small\r\nvelocity of 115 ft. per second. At the end of the first second it would\r\nbe at B, but now suppose that gravity is allowed to act for one second,\r\nit would at the end of that time have fallen 16 ft. vertically below B\r\nand have arrived at _b_. Similarly we may set off by scale on verticals\r\nthrough C, D, and E distances representing 64 ft., 144 ft., and 256 ft.\r\nrespectively. Because, for instance, the ball, without gravity acting,\r\nwould at the end of 3 seconds be at D, where we may suppose its course\r\narrested and gravity then allowed to act for 3 seconds to pull the ball\r\ndown from its position of rest at D; at the end of this period, gravity\r\nalone acting, its position would be 144 ft. vertically below D, because\r\ngravity pulls a body that distance in 3 seconds, and the actual position\r\n3 seconds after the ball had left the muzzle would be at _d_, after it\r\nhad described the curved path A, _b_, _c_, _d_. Supposing _d_ to be the\r\nhighest point of the trajectory, another 3 seconds would bring the ball\r\nalong a downward curve, and at the end of 6 seconds from the discharge\r\nit would be at a point on the same level as A. Now the complete curve\r\nwould be symmetrical on each side of a vertical line through its highest\r\npoint, and it would be in fact a regular _parabola_ with its vertex at\r\n_d_.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing presupposes that the air offers no resistance to the\r\npassage of the projectile through it. The fact however is quite\r\notherwise, for no sooner does the projectile begin its flight than its\r\nvelocity is constantly diminished by the air’s resistance. Now this\r\nresistance is complex, depending upon a number of different conditions,\r\nthe effect of which can be taken into account only by extremely complex\r\ncalculations. Obviously it will vary according to the area of the\r\nsection presented by the projectile to the line of its flight, and again\r\nby the shape of its front, for a pointed shot will cleave the air with\r\nless resistance than one with a flat front. Then the density of the air\r\nat the time will also enter into the calculation. The mass of the\r\nprojectile and also its velocity, upon which depend its _vis viva_,\r\nenergy, or power of overcoming resistance in doing work, will also have\r\nto be considered. Most complex of all is the law, or rather laws (_i.e._\r\nrelations), which connect the air resistance with the velocity; for this\r\nrelation no definite expression has been found. It is a function of the\r\nvelocity (known only by experiment under defined conditions), and\r\nvarying with the velocity itself. Thus for velocities up to 790 ft. per\r\nsecond, it is a function (determined experimentally) of the second power\r\nor square of the velocity; between 790 ft. per second and 990 ft. per\r\nsecond the law of resistance is changed and becomes a function of the\r\nthird power of the velocity; between 990 ft. and 1,120 ft. velocity the\r\nlaw again changes and is related to the sixth power of the velocity;\r\nbetween 1,120 ft. and 1,330 ft. the resistance is again related to the\r\nthird power of the velocity; and with higher speeds than that last named\r\nit is again more nearly related to the square of the velocity. It will\r\nbe seen that to calculate the path of a projectile is really a very\r\ndifficult mathematical problem, and indeed one which can be solved only\r\napproximately when all the known data are supplied.\r\n\r\nThe air resistance to the motion of a projectile is much greater than\r\nbefore trial would be supposed. Let us take an experiment that has\r\nactually been recorded, in which a bullet three-quarters of an inch in\r\ndiameter, weighing one-twelfth of a pound, was found to have a velocity\r\nof 1,670 ft. per second at a distance of 25 ft. from the gun, and this\r\n50 ft. farther was reduced to 1,550 ft. per second. Now if the reader\r\nwill calculate, according to the formula we have given above, the\r\n_energy_ due to the bullet’s velocity at these points, he will find it\r\nmust have done 500 foot-lbs. units of work in traversing the 50 ft., and\r\nas this could have been expended only in overcoming the resistance of\r\nthe air, we learn that this last must have been equivalent to a mean or\r\naverage pressure of 10 lbs. thrusting the bullet backwards.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to compare the difference in the trajectory of a\r\nprojectile under defined conditions, worked out with the air resistance\r\ntaken into account, compared with the trajectory when the air is\r\nsupposed to be non-existent. We find an example of the former problem\r\nfully worked out by many elaborate mathematical formulæ in Messrs. Lloyd\r\nand Hadcock’s treatise on Artillery. The problem is thus stated:—“An\r\n11–in. breech-loading howitzer” (a howitzer is a piece of ordnance used\r\nfor firing at high angles) “fires a 600–lb. projectile with an initial\r\nvelocity of 1,120 foot-sec. at an elevation of 20°. Find the range, time\r\nof flight, and angle of descent.” We shall calculate these points on the\r\nsuppositions adopted with regard to Fig. 80, and with no higher\r\nmathematics than common multiplication and division.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed that we supposed two motions that really take\r\nplace simultaneously to take place successively and independently: one\r\nin the direction of the line of fire, due to the initial velocity; the\r\nother vertically downwards, due to the action of gravity, the final\r\nresult being the same. This affords an excellent illustration of another\r\nof Newton’s laws of motion, and should be considered by the reader in\r\nthis connection. The law itself admits of being stated in various ways,\r\nas thus:—“Whenever a force acts on a body, it produces upon it exactly\r\nthe same change of motion in its own direction, whether the body be\r\noriginally at rest or in motion in any direction with any velocity\r\nwhatever—whether it be at the same time acted on by other forces or\r\nnot.” Or again: “When two forces act in any direction whatever on a body\r\nfree to move, they impress upon it a motion which is the _superposition_\r\n(or compounding) of those that it would receive if each force acted\r\nseparately.” The law is given also in the following form (Thomson and\r\nTait):—“When any forces act on a body, then, whether the body be\r\noriginally at rest or moving with any velocity and in any direction,\r\neach force produces in the body the exact change of motion which it\r\nwould have had had it acted singly on the body originally at rest.” In\r\nall of these expressions the word “forces” is used, and a very\r\nconvenient word it is, but it may be noted in passing, nothing but a\r\nword; for it stands for no real self-existing things, since, apart from\r\nobserved changes of motion in bodies, forces for us have no existence.\r\nNevertheless, it is useful for the sake of abbreviating statements about\r\nchanges of motion, to regard these actions as produced by imaginary\r\nagents—imagined for the time and for this purpose, and therefore vainly\r\nto be sought for in the realm of reality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 81.—_Diagram._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the trajectory of the howitzer’s projectile through\r\nairless space we have no concern with its diameter nor with its weight.\r\nWe use the little diagram, Fig. 81, to represent the motions,—_c_ being\r\na horizontal line, _a_, a vertical one, the angle at B is therefore a\r\nright angle, and we assume that at A to be 20°. Now, the most elementary\r\ngeometry teaches us that every triangle having these angles will have\r\nthe lengths of its sides in the same invariable proportions one to\r\nanother whatever may be the size of the triangle itself, and it has been\r\nfound convenient to calculate these proportions once for all, not merely\r\nfor angle 20°, but for every angle up to 90°. Besides this, distinct\r\nnames have been given to the proportions of every side of the triangle\r\nto each of the other two sides. Thus in the triangle before us, if we\r\ntake _a_, _b_, and _c_ to represent the numbers expressing the lengths\r\nof the sides against which they are placed, _a_ divided by _b_, that is\r\n_a_ ÷ _b_, or _a_/_b_, is called the _sine_ of angle 20°, while _c_/_b_\r\nis named the _cosine_ of that angle, etc. These therefore are _numbers_\r\nwhich are given in mathematical tables, and we find by these that _sine_\r\n20° = 0·3420201, and _cosine_ 20° = 0·9396926, and these with the\r\ninitial velocity give us all the data we require. We may first find the\r\n_time_ the projectile would take to reach the ground level, or strictly\r\nthat of the muzzle of the gun at B. Taking _t_ to stand for this time,\r\nwe know that AC = 1,120 × _t_, but CB will be the distance that a body\r\nwould fall from rest at C by the influence of gravity in that same time,\r\n_t_, and it is known by experiment that this distance is 16·1 feet\r\nmultiplied by the _square_ of the time from rest in seconds. We have now\r\ntherefore the length of the line CB, and put _a_/_b_ = CB/AC = (16·1 ×\r\n_t_^2)/(1,120 × _t_) = _sine_ 20° = ·3420201, and dividing numerator and\r\ndenominator by _t_ and multiplying the above 3rd and 5th expressions by\r\n1,120, we have\r\n\r\n                 16·1 × _t_ = 1,120 × ·3420201\r\n\r\n                              1,120 × ·3420201\r\n          and therefore _t_ = ———————————————— = 23·7927 secs.\r\n                                    16·1\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the time, it will be easy to work out the lengths _b_\r\nand _a_ as 26,648 ft. and 9114·1 ft. respectively; and as _c_/_b_ =\r\n_cosine_ 20°, we have _c_ = 26,648 × ·9396926 = 25040·8 ft., which is\r\nthe _range_. The trajectory will be a curve (parabola) symmetrical on\r\neach side of a vertical line half-way between A and B, and the length of\r\nthis line within the triangle will be equal to half of _a_, and in half\r\nof 23·7927 seconds the projectile, supposed to move only along the line\r\nAC, would reach the point where this vertical axis intersects AC. If\r\nduring this half-time it had been falling from rest at the same\r\nintersection, it would have reached a point below by a space just one\r\nquarter of CB (the spaces fallen through being as the _squares_ of the\r\ntimes), and therefore at this its highest point its distance above AB\r\nwould also be one quarter the length of _a_ = 2278·525 ft., which\r\ndistance is called the _height_ of the trajectory; and the descending\r\ncurve being in every respect symmetrical to the ascending branch, the\r\nangle at which this would be inclined to AB would be 20°, but in the\r\nopposite direction to BAC, while the velocity would be the same as at A.\r\nWe may now compare these results with those calculated when the air\r\nresistance is taken into account:—\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐\r\n │                                 │Without air│With air   │           │\r\n │                                 │resistance.│resistance.│Difference.│\r\n ├─────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┤\r\n │Time of descent                  │23·7927    │22·61 sec. │–1·18 sec. │\r\n │                                 │secs.      │           │           │\r\n │Angle of descent                 │20°        │23° 49´    │+3° 49´    │\r\n │Velocity of descent              │1120       │868·8      │–251·2     │\r\n │                                 │foot-secs. │foot-secs. │f.-s.      │\r\n │Range                            │25040·8 ft.│20,622 ft. │–4418·8 ft.│\r\n │Height of trajectory             │2278·5 ft. │1989 ft.   │–288·5 ft. │\r\n └─────────────────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘\r\n\r\nWith the air resistance the trajectory will no longer be a symmetrical\r\ncurve: its highest point, instead of being on the vertical line midway\r\nbetween A and B, will be on one 1,050 ft. nearer to B than to A, and the\r\ndescending branch will be steeper than the ascending. The total time, it\r\nwill be observed, is less, although the final, and therefore the mean,\r\nvelocity, is also less; but this shortening of the time is due to the\r\ntrajectory itself being much less in length. The range of the projectile\r\nis decreased by 4,418 ft., or 1,473 yards, or more than four-fifths of a\r\nmile. The loss of velocity at the descent is very notable, and the\r\nreader will find it interesting to calculate the corresponding loss of\r\nenergy by the formula already given.\r\n\r\nThe reader should now easily understand that the projectile from a rifle\r\nor gun discharged horizontally through airless space at the height of\r\n16·1 ft. above a level plain would strike the ground in one second at a\r\nrange or distance from the gun exactly equal to the initial velocity, or\r\nif the gun were on a tower and its axis 64·4 ft. above the plain, the\r\nrange would then be 2V. It will be seen therefore that, corresponding to\r\nthe range intended, there must be in general a certain inclination given\r\nto the axis of the piece in aiming, and this is done by means of the\r\n_sights_, one of which near the muzzle is usually fixed, while that next\r\nthe breech is adjustable by sliding along an upright bar, which is\r\ngraduated so that the proper elevation may be given for any required\r\nrange. These graduations are made from experiments, and of course have\r\nreference only to some standard quantity and quality of ammunition and a\r\nstandard of weight, shape, and material in the projectile. Sometimes\r\nlarge pieces of ordnance are laid by elevation in degrees, etc., marked\r\non their mounting, the angles being taken from a table prepared for that\r\nparticular gun and ammunition, from experiments at different ranges.\r\n\r\nAfter these generalities about fire-arms we may enter upon certain\r\nparticulars about the construction of some varieties, beginning with\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _THE MILITARY RIFLE._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 82.—_Muzzle-loading Musket and Rifles_ (_obsolete patterns_).\r\n\r\n  A. Brown Bess and Bayonet; B. Brunswick Rifle; C. Enfield Rifle and\r\n    Bayonet.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 82 are represented the muzzle-loading musket and muzzle-loading\r\nrifles which formed the regulation weapons of the British infantry from\r\nthe beginning of the century up to the year 1864. Somewhat slow in its\r\nearlier stages was the development of the modern military rifle from the\r\nold smooth bore musket with its flint-lock, which was the ordinary\r\nweapon of the British and other armies up to nearly the middle of this\r\ncentury. Partly, perhaps, owing to the inherent conservatism of\r\ngovernment departments, and partly to the very serious outlay involved\r\nin arming all the troops of a nation with a new weapon, it has happened\r\nthat many improvements in small arms were in use as applied to sporting\r\nguns, long before they were adopted in the regulation weapons of armies.\r\nThe advance towards the modern arm of precision has been made along all\r\nthe several directions that converge in the latest product, and it may\r\nbe said that the most obvious of these are spiral rifling,\r\nbreech-loading, and improved ammunition. The improvements in any one of\r\nthese particulars would have been of little advantage unless the others\r\nhad been kept in line with it. How long antiquated systems may continue\r\nin use may be illustrated by the case of the flint-lock, which was\r\nretained in the British army from the time it superseded the old\r\nmatch-lock, in the latter part of the seventeenth century, down to\r\nalmost the middle of this present nineteenth. It is quite possible that\r\nnot a few readers still in their fifties may never have seen a\r\nflint-lock outside of a museum, yet this was the firing apparatus of the\r\nweapon that used to be affectionately known to our soldiers as “Brown\r\nBess,” and that for a century and a half continued the regulation arm of\r\nBritish troops helping Wellington to win his victories, and superseded\r\nby the percussion musket only in 1842. The “Brown Bess” of the earlier\r\npart of the century had a smooth-bore barrel of three-quarters of an\r\ninch diameter (0·753 inch), and 39 inches long; this musket weighed,\r\nwith its bayonet, 11 lbs., 2 oz. The bullet was spherical, and made of\r\nlead, in weight a little over one ounce. The diameter of the bullet was\r\nslightly smaller than the bore of the barrel, because a closely fitting\r\nball could not be used, on account of the great force required to push\r\nit home with a ram-rod. The bullet was therefore wrapped in loosely\r\nfitting material, called a “patch,” and this made the gun easy to load,\r\neven when the barrel was “fouled” by the solid residues that always\r\nremain after the explosion of gunpowder. “Brown Bess” was credited with\r\na range of 200 yards, but its want of accuracy was such that the soldier\r\nwas directed not to fire until he could see the whites of the enemies’\r\neyes. But in 1800 one or two British regiments were armed with the\r\nmuzzle-loading rifle known as Baker’s, and again in 1835 these were\r\nprovided with the _Brunswick rifle_. These regiments afterwards became\r\nknown as the Rifle Brigade. The bullets in both cases were spherical,\r\nand as the earlier pattern had a seven-grooved barrel, there was so much\r\ndifficulty in introducing the bullets into the muzzles that mallets had\r\nto be used. The bullet of the Brunswick rifle was encircled by a\r\nprojecting band, which fitted into two rather deep grooves diametrically\r\nopposite to each other in the barrel. This bullet, wrapped in some\r\nslightly greased material, could be readily dropped into the muzzle, and\r\nrammed home without difficulty. Moreover, whereas in Baker’s rifle the\r\ngrooves made only a quarter of a turn in the length of the barrel, the\r\ngrooves of the Brunswick rifle made more than one complete turn. This\r\nwas so much an improvement on “Brown Bess” that the effective range was\r\nmore than doubled. For the rank and file of the infantry regiments the\r\nflint-lock smooth-bore musket was, however, the regulation weapon until\r\n1842, when it was superseded by the percussion musket. The\r\npercussion-cap is now comparatively little used, as, since the\r\nintroduction of cartridges containing their own means of ignition, it is\r\nrapidly becoming a thing of the past. The copper percussion-cap, in the\r\nform it still retains, was invented about 1816, and was universally\r\nadopted for sporting-guns a long time before it was used for the\r\nmilitary weapon. In 1842 the percussion musket was definitely adopted as\r\nthe weapon of the British army, but up to that date the flint-locks\r\nstill continued to be made at Birmingham.\r\n\r\nThe barrel of the percussion musket then issued was shortly afterwards\r\nrifled, when about the year 1852 the Minié system was adopted, and the\r\nGovernment awarded to M. Minié, a Frenchman, the sum of £20,000 for the\r\nbullet he had invented. What the meaning of this improvement was may now\r\nbe explained, and we must begin by mentioning the various forms of\r\ngrooving, or, at least, such forms as found some approval during the\r\npresent century, for grooved barrels had been tried long before. At\r\nfirst the grooves appear to have been intended merely to receive the\r\nfouling, and these were often made without any twist or spiral, but\r\nparallel to the axis of the barrel. The grooves are hollow channels of\r\ngreater or less depth, and of various forms; square, triangular,\r\nrounded, or of such a form that the inner line of a section of the\r\nbarrel would present the form of a ratchet wheel. The numbers of the\r\ngrooves made use of have varied between two and twelve, or more, and\r\ndifferent rates of twist, or numbers of turns of the spiral in the\r\nlength of the barrel have been resorted to, these ranging from half a\r\nturn to twelve turns. The Brunswick rifle had been found wanting in\r\naccuracy, when at length in 1846 General Jacobs proposed the adoption of\r\nthe conical bullet with projecting spiral ridges which fitted into\r\ngrooves cut in the rifle barrel. The difficulty in using muzzle-loading\r\nrifles consisted in the force required to ram down the bullet, which had\r\nto adapt itself to the grooves, and fill them up so that the gases due\r\nto the explosion of the powder should not escape. If the bullet simply\r\ndropped into the bore of the rifle easily, it did not effectually fill\r\nthe grooves, which then became channels of this _windage_, and if, on\r\nthe other hand, the leaden bullet was made to fill the grooves from the\r\nmuzzle, great force was required, and the time and effort expended in\r\nramming the missile home, detracted enormously from the efficiency of\r\nthe rifle as a military weapon. Mr. Lancaster produced rifles having a\r\nslightly oval, instead of a circular, bore, making, of course, the\r\nnecessary twist within the barrel. A bullet of the corresponding\r\nsection, but nearly globular, much as if the projecting belt of the\r\nBrunswick bullet had been laterally extended to its opposite poles,\r\ncould be easily dropped in at the muzzle, without force being required\r\nto make it take grooves, the barrel being internally smooth throughout.\r\nIt was, however, soon found that this easy-fitting ball allowed a\r\nconsiderable amount of _windage_, and the Minié system was definitely\r\nadopted, in which advantage was taken of a fact observed some years\r\nbefore by a French artillery officer, who found that an elongated leaden\r\nbullet, if hollowed out at the base, was so expanded by the pressure of\r\nthe powder gases that the material was forced into the grooves of a\r\nrifle. Minié made his bullet elongated, pointed in front, and hollowed\r\nout part of its length by a conical space, the widest part of which was\r\nat the base, and was covered by a small iron cup, that, when driven\r\ninwards by the pressure of the gases, caused an expansion of the bullet\r\nby which the lead was forced into the grooves of the rifling. But the\r\nforces operating on the base of the bullet would at times cause the iron\r\ncup to cut the bullet in two, and propel the anterior portion only,\r\nleaving the base in the form of a ring clinging to the rifling. The\r\nmilitary authorities had many comparative trials carried out between the\r\nsmooth-bore percussion musket and the Minié rifle. The greater accuracy\r\nof the latter may be inferred from the results of practice made by men\r\nfiring at a target 6 feet high and 20 feet broad; when at 100 yards\r\ndistance, 74 hits out of 100 shots were made from the musket, against 94\r\nfrom the rifle; and the superiority of the latter, at longer ranges, was\r\nincreasingly marked. Thus at 260, 300, and 400 yards the respective\r\npercentages of hits were for the musket 42, 16, 4½, but for the same\r\nranges the rifle gave 80, 55, 52.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 83.—_The Minié Bullet._\r\n]\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the principle of the expanding bullet had been brought\r\nforward by the late Mr. W. Greener seventeen years before the government\r\nprize was awarded to M. Minié. Mr. Greener’s bullets were of an oval\r\nform, being half as long again as their diameter, with one end flattened\r\nwhere the lead was excavated in a narrowing hollow nearly through the\r\nbullet. In this opening was inserted the end of a tapering plug of hard\r\nmetal, and when the rifle was fired this plug was driven home, and the\r\nlead thus expanded took the grooves, so preventing windage, and giving\r\nrange and accuracy; while allowing the piece to be loaded with as much\r\nease as the smooth-bore musket. The invention, though favourably\r\nreported on by the military authorities at the time, did not receive the\r\nattention it would seem to have deserved. However, in 1857, Mr.\r\nGreener’s claim of priority for the first suggestion of the expanding\r\nbullet was acknowledged by a government award of £1,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 84.—_Greener’s Expanding Bullet._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Whitworth, having been invited by the British military\r\nauthorities to institute experiments with a view to producing the best\r\ntype of rifle, with the help of the most perfect machinery, constructed\r\nthe barrels with a polygonal bore, a plan which he had before adopted\r\nfor large guns. The barrels were accurately bored out to a hexagonal\r\nsection, and experiments were made to find what number of turns in the\r\ntwist would give the projectile a sufficient rapidity of rotation to\r\nmaintain it during its flight parallel to its axis. It was found that\r\none turn in 20 inches was sufficient, and the projectile was made by\r\nmachinery to fit accurately but easily into the rifled bore, so that it\r\ndropped into its place, and the loading could be expeditiously\r\nperformed. The bullet was long, compared with the bore, which was made\r\nsmaller than before, and it was found that the explosion caused it to\r\nexpand sufficiently to fill up the corners of the hexagon, so that there\r\nwas no loss from windage. The accuracy of aim of the Whitworth rifle was\r\nsuperior to that of any weapon of the kind that had, up to that time,\r\nbeen produced. When officially tried against the Enfield, its mean\r\ndeviation at 500 yards range was only 4½ inches, while that of the\r\nEnfield at the same range was 27 inches. Mr. Whitworth had proved the\r\nadvantages of using a small bore, an elongated bullet, and a sharp twist\r\nin the rifling; and it was acknowledged that as a military weapon his\r\nrifle was superior to all other arms of similar calibre that had before\r\nbeen produced. Some doubt appears to have been entertained, however, as\r\nto whether the mechanical perfection of the trial rifles could be\r\nmaintained if they came to be manufactured on the large scale, and also\r\nas whether an adequate supply of the polygonal ammunition would be\r\nprocurable when required. The Whitworth rifle was never adopted into the\r\ngovernment service, and soon after these trials in 1857, the adoption of\r\nanother type of weapon became imperative, as the results obtained by the\r\nGermans with their needle-gun, demonstrated the enormous advantages of a\r\nbreech-loading rifle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 85.—_The Chassepot Rifle.—Section of the Breech._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe French then adopted the Chassepot rifle (so called after its\r\ninventor), which embodied the same principle as the needle-gun, but with\r\nimprovements. This arm has a rifled barrel, with a breech mechanism of\r\ngreat simplicity, which is represented in section in Fig. 85. The piece\r\nmarked B corresponds to what is called the “hammer” in the old lock used\r\nwith percussion-caps, and the first operation in charging the rifle\r\nconsists in drawing out B, as shown in the cut, until, by the spring, C,\r\nconnected with the trigger, A, falling into a notch, the hammer, if we\r\nmay so term it, is retained in that position. The effect of this\r\nmovement is to draw out also a small rod attached to the hammer, and\r\nterminated in front by a needle, about ½ in. long, at the same time that\r\na spiral spring surrounding the rod is compressed, the spring being\r\nfastened to the front end of the rod, and abutting against a screw-plug,\r\nwhich closes the hinder end of F, and permits only the rod to pass\r\nthrough it. The piece F, which is also movable, has projecting from its\r\nfront end a little hollow cylinder, through the centre of which the\r\nneedle passes, and this little cylinder has a collar, serving to retain\r\nits position, an india-rubber ring surrounding a portion of the\r\ncylinder, and forming a plug to effectually close the rear end of the\r\nbarrel. It will be noticed that the cylinder is continued by a smaller\r\nprojection, which forms a sheath for the point of the needle. The\r\nmovable breech-piece, F, is provided with a short lever, E, by which it\r\nis worked. The second movement performed by the person who is charging\r\nthe piece is to turn this lever from a horizontal to a vertical\r\nposition, which thus causes the piece F to turn 90° about its axis, and\r\nthen by drawing the lever towards him he removes the piece F from the\r\nend of the barrel, which, thus exposed, is ready to receive the\r\ncartridge. The cartridge contains the powder and the bullet in one case,\r\nthe posterior portion containing also a charge of _fulminate_ in the\r\ncentre, and it is by the needle penetrating the case of the cartridge\r\nand detonating this fulminate that the charge is exploded. When the\r\ncartridge has been placed in the barrel, the piece F is pushed forward,\r\nthe metallic collar and india-rubber ring stop up the rear of the\r\nbarrel, and on turning the lever, E, into a horizontal position, the\r\nbreech is entirely closed. If now the trigger be drawn, the hammer is\r\nreleased, and the spring carries it forward, at the same time impelling\r\nthe needle through the base of the cartridge-case, where it immediately\r\ncauses the explosion of the fulminate. The bullet is conical, and its\r\nbase having a slight enlargement, the latter moulds itself to the\r\ngrooves with which the barrel is rifled. When the piece has not to be\r\nfired immediately, the lever is not placed horizontally, but in an\r\ninclined position, in which the hammer cannot move forward, even if the\r\ntrigger be drawn. The Chassepot has an effective range of 1,093 yards,\r\nand the projectile leaves the piece with a velocity of 1,345 ft. per\r\nsecond, the trajectory being such that at 230 yards the bullet is only\r\n18 in. above the straight line. The piece can be charged and fired by\r\nthe soldier in any position, and it was found that it could be\r\ndischarged from seven to ten times per minute, even when aim was taken\r\nthrough the sights with which it is furnished, and fourteen or fifteen\r\ntimes per minute without sighting. The ordinary rifled musket, which\r\nthis arm superseded, could only be fired twice in a minute, and could\r\nonly be loaded when the soldier was standing up.\r\n\r\nOther nations followed either by adopting as their infantry arm some\r\nform of breech-loader, or by converting their muzzle-loaders into\r\nbreech-loaders as a temporary expedient, pending the selection of some\r\nmore perfect type. When in 1864 a committee which had been appointed to\r\ninvestigate the question of proper arms for our infantry, recommended\r\nthat that branch of the service should be supplied with breech-loaders,\r\nour Government, considering that no form of breech-loader had up to that\r\ntime been invented which would unequivocally meet all the requirements\r\nof the case, wisely determined that, pending the selection of a suitable\r\narm, the service muzzle-loaders should meanwhile be converted into\r\nbreech-loaders. The problem of how this was to be done was solved by the\r\ngunmaker Snider, and in the “Converted Enfield” or “Snider” the British\r\narmy was provided for a time with an arm satisfying the requirements of\r\nthat period. This change of weapon was effected at a comparatively small\r\noutlay, for the conversion cost less than twenty shillings an arm. The\r\nbreech action in the Snider consisted of a solid piece of metal which\r\nclosed the breech end of the barrel, and, being hinged on the right-hand\r\nside parallel to the barrel, could be turned aside, making room for the\r\ninsertion into the conically widened bore of a metallic cartridge case,\r\ninvented by Colonel Boxer, which contained the projectile, the powder\r\ncharge, and the means of ignition in itself. A short backward movement\r\nof the breech-lock caused a claw acting on the base of the spent\r\ncartridge case to withdraw it from the barrel, and then the reaction of\r\na spring brought the breech-block back into position, after insertion of\r\na new cartridge. This cartridge proved very effective in increasing the\r\nrange and accuracy of the weapon. It should be mentioned that all the\r\nbreech-loading mechanisms are provided with arrangements by which the\r\nmetallic cases of the spent cartridges are automatically extracted from\r\nthe barrel. The authorities having, in 1866, offered gunmakers and\r\nothers handsome prizes for the production of rifles best fulfilling\r\ncertain conditions, nine weapons were selected out of 104 as worthy to\r\ncompete. No first prize was awarded, but the second was given to Mr.\r\nHenry, while Mr. Martini was seventh on the list. In order to obtain a\r\nweapon fulfilling all the requirements, a vast number of experiments\r\nwere made by the committee appointed for that purpose, as to best\r\nconstruction of barrel, size of bore, system of rifling, kind of\r\ncartridge, and other particulars, and assistance was rendered by several\r\neminent gunsmiths and engineers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 86.—_Section of Martini-Henry Lock._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter a severe competition it appeared that the best weapon would be\r\nproduced by combining Henry’s system of rifling with Martini’s mechanism\r\nfor breech-loading. The parts constituting the lock and the mechanism\r\nfor working the breech, shown in Fig. 86, are contained in a metal case,\r\nto which is attached the woodwork of the stock, now constructed in two\r\nparts. To this case is attached the butt of the rifle by a strong metal\r\nbolt 6 in. in length, A, which is inserted through a hole in the\r\nheel-plate. The part that closes the breech—termed the “block”—is marked\r\nB. It turns loosely on a pin, C, passing through its rear end and fixed\r\ninto the case at a level somewhat higher than the axis of the barrel.\r\nThe end of the block is rounded off so as to form with the rear end of\r\nthe case, D, which is hollowed out to receive it in a perfect knuckle\r\njoint. Let it be observed that this rounded surface, which is the width\r\nof the block, receives the whole force of the recoil, no strain being\r\nput on the pin, C, on which the block turns. In the experiments a leaden\r\npin was substituted, and the action of the mechanism was not in the\r\nleast impaired. This arrangement serves greatly to diminish the wear and\r\nthe possibility of damage from the recoil. As the pin on which the block\r\nturns is slightly above the axis at the barrel, it follows that the\r\nblock, when not supported, immediately drops down below the barrel.\r\nBehind the trigger-guard is a lever, E, working on a pin, F, fitted into\r\nthe lower part of the case. To this lever is attached a much shorter\r\npiece called the “tumbler,” which projects into the case, G. It is this\r\ntumbler which acts as a support for the block, and raises it into its\r\nfiring position or lowers it according as the lever, E, is drawn toward\r\na firer or pushed forward. How this is accomplished will be readily\r\nunderstood by observing the form of the notch, H, in which the upper end\r\nof the tumbler moves. It will be noticed that the piece being in the\r\nposition for firing, if the lever be pushed back, G slides away from the\r\nshallower part of the notch into the deeper, and the block accordingly\r\nfalls into the position shown in the figure; and if again the lever is\r\ndrawn backward, G acting on H will raise the block to its former\r\nposition. The block or breech-piece is hollowed out on its upper\r\nsurface, I, so as to permit the cartridge to be readily inserted into\r\nthe exploding chamber, J. The centre of the block is bored out, and\r\ncontains within the vital mechanism for exploding the cartridge, namely,\r\na spiral spring, of which the little marks at K are the coils in\r\nsection. These coils pass round apiece of metal called the “striker,”\r\nwhich is armed with a point, capable of passing through a hole in the\r\nfront face of the block exactly behind the percussion-cap of the\r\ncartridge when the block is in the firing position. When the lever\r\nhandle is moved _forward_, it causes the tumbler, which works on the\r\nsame pin, to revolve, and one of its arms draws back the striker,\r\ncompressing the spring in so doing, so that as the block drops down the\r\npoint of the striker is drawn inwards. In this position the piece\r\nreceives the cartridge into the chamber. The lever, E, being now drawn\r\nbackward, the piece is forced into the notch, H, and the block is kept\r\nfirmly in its place; besides this, there is a further compression of the\r\nspring by the tumbler, and in this position the spring is retained by\r\nthe rest-piece, L, which is pushed into a bend in the tumbler. By\r\npulling the trigger this piece is released, so that the tumbler can\r\nrevolve freely, and relieve the pent-up spring, whose elasticity impels\r\nthe striker forward, so that this enters the carriage directly. A very\r\nimportant and ingenious part of this arrangement is the contrivance for\r\nextracting the case of the exploded cartridge. The extractor turns on\r\nthe pin, M, and has two arms pointing upwards, N, which are pressed by\r\nthe rim of the cartridge pushed home into two grooves cut in the sides\r\nof the barrel. It has another arm, O, bent only slightly upwards and\r\npointing towards the centre of the case, and forming an angle of about\r\n80° with the above-mentioned upright arm; when, by pushing forward the\r\nlever, its short arm drops into the recess, the block, no longer\r\nsupported, falls, and hits the point of the bent arm of extractor, so\r\ncausing the two upright arms to extract the cartridge-case a little way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 87.—_The Martini-Henry Rifle._\r\n\r\n  A, ready for loading; B, loaded and ready for firing.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe barrel is of steel; the calibre is 0·451 in. It is rifled on Mr.\r\nHenry’s patent system. The section of the bore may be generally\r\ndescribed as a heptagon with re-entering angles at the junctions of the\r\nplanes, so that there are fourteen points of contact for the bullet,\r\nviz., one in the middle of each plane, and one at each of the\r\nre-entering angles. The twist of rifling is one turn in 22 in. The\r\ncharge consists of 85 grains of powder, and a bullet weighing 480\r\ngrains, of a form designed by Mr. Henry. The cartridge is of the same\r\ngeneral construction as the “Boxer” cartridge, used in the Snider rifle,\r\nbut it is bottle-shaped, the diameter being enlarged from a short\r\ndistance in rear of the bullet, in order to admit of its being made\r\nshorter, and consequently stronger, than would be otherwise possible. A\r\nwad of bees’-wax is placed between the bullet and powder, by which the\r\nbarrel is lubricated at each discharge. The sword-bayonet to be used\r\nwith this rifle is of a pattern proposed by Lord Elcho. It is a short\r\nsword, broad towards the point, and furnished on a portion of the back\r\nwith a double row of teeth, so as to form a stout saw. It is so balanced\r\nas to form a powerful chopping implement, so that, in addition to its\r\nprimary use as a bayonet, it will be useful for cutting and sawing\r\nbrushwood, small trees, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal particulars of weight, dimensions, &c.,\r\nof the Martini-Henry rifle:\r\n\r\n                         │Without bayonet            4 ft.     1     in.\r\n Length of rifle         │With bayonet fixed         5 ft.     8     in.\r\n                         │Of barrel                  2 ft.     9·22  in.\r\n\r\n Calibre                 │                                     0·451 in.\r\n\r\n Rifling                 │Grooves                    7\r\n                         │Twist                      1 turn in 22    in.\r\n\r\n Weight                  │Without bayonet            8 lbs.    7     oz.\r\n                         │With bayonet              10 lbs.    4     oz.\r\n\r\n Bayonet                 │Length                     2 ft.     1½    in.\r\n                         │Weight without scabbard    1 lb.     8     oz.\r\n\r\n Charge of powder        │                          85 grains.\r\n Weight of bullet        │                         480 grains.\r\n\r\n                  The rifle is sighted to 1,400 yards.\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the accuracy of fire in this rifle, it may be stated\r\nthat of twenty shots fired at 1,200 yards, the mean absolute deflection\r\nof the hits from the centre of the group was 2·28 ft. The highest point\r\nin the trajectory at 500 yards is rather over 8 ft. so that the bullet\r\nwould not pass over a cavalry soldier’s head within that distance. The\r\ntrajectory of the Snider at the same range rises to nearly 12 ft. The\r\nbullet will pass through from thirteen to seventeen ½ in. elm planks\r\nplaced 1 in. apart at 20 yards distance; the number pierced by the\r\nSnider under similar circumstances being from seven to nine. As regards\r\nrapidity of fire, twenty rounds have been fired in 53 seconds; and one\r\narm which had been exposed to rain and water artificially applied for\r\nseven days and nights, and had during that time fired 400 rounds, was\r\nthen fired, without cleaning, twenty rounds in 1 minute 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nRifles of the Martini-Henry and Chassepot type were soon superseded, for\r\nas early as 1876 Switzerland had armed her troops with a magazine rifle\r\nof a smaller calibre than any then in use, and this weapon was found so\r\neffective that in a few years after every European nation had followed\r\nsuit, as also had the United States and Japan, each country adopting\r\nsome particular pattern of a weapon with certain modifications. Of these\r\nthe Mannlicher and the Mauser are much used. A magazine rifle is one\r\nthat can be fired several times successively without reloading. Like\r\nrevolvers, the magazine arms repeat their fire, but instead of having\r\nseveral distinct firing chambers, they have but one, from which the\r\nempty cartridge cases are automatically extracted by the breech\r\nmechanism, for the magazine rifle is necessarily a breech-loader. The\r\nmagazine rifle carries a supply of cartridges, which one after another\r\nare brought into the firing chamber by the simple action of the breech\r\nmechanism, so that the soldier is enabled to discharge several rounds in\r\nany position without reloading. The several varieties of the magazine\r\nrifle may be classed according to the position of the magazine. This may\r\nbe: First, in the stock; second, under the barrel; third, in a box under\r\nthe breech; or fourth, in a box above the breech. In the first and\r\nsecond variety the cartridges are in line in a tube, out of which they\r\nare moved on by a spiral spring, and this was the earlier form of the\r\nweapon. The box above or below the breech is the later development, and\r\nhas the advantage of holding the cartridges lying side by side, and thus\r\nin a position in which they are not so liable to injure each other as in\r\nthe tubular arrangements. Then, again, the movement of the cartridge in\r\nthe breechbox in arriving at the firing chamber is much less than in the\r\nlinear magazines, and the centre of gravity of the whole changes but\r\nlittle when the supply is exhausted. With any of the varieties of\r\nmagazine a suitable modification of the mechanism may be adopted, so\r\nthat the weapon can at will be used as a single firing rifle, but\r\nchangeable in an instant to the magazine form. Again, the box magazine\r\nmay be made as a fixture on the rifle, or it may be detachable.\r\nCommissions of military authorities had for several years been\r\ndeliberating upon the best models for their respective nations, while\r\nProfessor Hebler was working out his researches as to the best calibre\r\nfor military rifles. Hebler published a work showing the great\r\nadvantages of a bore one-third less in diameter than that commonly in\r\nuse, which was about 0·45 inch, as in our Martini-Henry. The\r\nsmall-calibre rifle shoots straighter and hits harder than the large\r\nbore one, and the recoil is less, and so is the weight of the weapon.\r\nLead is found to be too soft a material for the bullet of the small-bore\r\nrifles, as it does not keep in the rifling, which has a sharper turn\r\nthan that in the older weapon; hence the bullets are now cased in steel\r\nor nickel. These bullets have remarkable power of penetration. Some will\r\ngo through a steel plate 1¼ inch thick, making a clean hole in it, and\r\nthe Lebel bullet penetrates 15 inches of solid oak, at a distance of 220\r\nyards. Such a missile would, therefore, be capable of going completely\r\nthrough the bodies of several men or horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 88.—_The Mannlicher Magazine Rifle._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Germans, about 1888, adopted a magazine rifle known as the Mauser.\r\nIt had a fixed tubular magazine for eight rounds below the barrel, and a\r\nbreech mechanism of the Remington-Keene type. The French followed suit\r\nwith their famous Lebel gun, the construction of which was long kept\r\nsecret. It also has a fixed under barrel tubular magazine, and the\r\ncartridges used with it contain smokeless powder. It is said that a new\r\ngun of practically the same pattern has been adopted by Russia, but with\r\na detachable magazine to contain five rounds. The Russian gun will also\r\nuse smokeless powder. In England, a small-bore rifle of 0·303 inches\r\ncalibre is now issued to all troops. It has an under breechbox magazine,\r\nmodified from the Lee rifle. The box is detachable, so that the weapon\r\ncould normally be used as a single loader, and the magazine attached\r\nonly when required. But the British authorities have decided that the\r\nmagazine box is to be attached to the weapon by a chain. The first issue\r\nof this pattern of rifle to British soldiers took place early in 1890.\r\nThe Austrians are adopting the Mannlicher pattern, in which the magazine\r\nidea is embodied in a complete and practical form. This rifle has a\r\nfixed box magazine below the breech. From this box, in which the\r\ncartridges—five in number—lie side by side, they are fed up by springs\r\nas they are disposed of by the movement of the breech mechanism. The\r\nmagazine is recharged by placing in it a tin case containing five\r\ncartridges, and the case drops out when all the cartridges have been\r\nfired. In this form there is of course no necessity for providing any\r\nmechanism for holding the magazine in reserve while the rifle is used as\r\na single loader. As to calibre, the Austrian authorities follow other\r\ncountries in adopting a small bore, namely, 0·315 inch. Italy has\r\nconverted her single-fire Vetterli rifle into a magazine arm, with a box\r\nsomething like the Mannlicher, and Belgium has adopted a gun of the same\r\ntype. The rate of fire from charged magazines of such guns as the “Lee,”\r\n“Mannlicher” and “Vetterli,” worked with the right hand without bringing\r\nthe piece down from the shoulder is, for all of them, about one shot per\r\nsecond; but the time that is required to recharge the magazines varies\r\nmuch according to the contrivance used. The number of rounds the\r\nmagazine of a rifle is capable of containing when fully charged is from\r\n5 to 12, or more, according to the difference of system. It is\r\nconsidered that in the detachable Lee or the quick recharging Mannlicher\r\nfive rounds are ample for use at a critical moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 89.—_The Magazine and Breech of the Mannlicher Rifle._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe calibre of the military rifle has been decreased with almost every\r\nnew pattern adopted. Thus, while the _old_ “Brown Bess” had a calibre of\r\n0·75 inch, in the last issue of it the bore was reduced to 0·693 inch;\r\nthe Enfield (1852) had a bore of 0·577 inch; the Martini-Henry, 0·451\r\ninch, which, in a newer pattern adopted in 1887, was reduced to 0·400\r\ninch; and, finally, in the Lee-Metford, the calibre is only 0·303 inch.\r\nA similar consecutive reduction of bores has taken place in the rifles\r\nadopted by other countries, and one of the latest type, issued for the\r\nuse of the United States Navy, has a bore of only 0·236 inch, and it is\r\neven expected that a still smaller one will become general. The\r\nadvantage of the narrow and lighter projectile is that while it has a\r\nhigher initial velocity with a given charge, its flight is less checked\r\nby the resistance of the atmosphere, the section it presents being so\r\nmuch less. Thus the bullet of 0·236 inch diameter has a section little\r\nmore than one-fourth that of the 0·45 inch bullet. The difference is\r\nwell shown in the comparative heights of the _trajectory_ (or path of\r\nthe bullet) of the Martini-Henry 0·450 inch bullet, and that of the\r\n0·303 inch Lee-Metford (the latter with _cordite_ ammunition); for at a\r\nrange of 1,000 yards the former reaches to 48 feet above the line of\r\nsight, while the latter rises to only 25 feet.\r\n\r\nSome form of repeating or magazine rifle has now been adopted by all the\r\nmost important nations of the world. The number of shots contained in\r\nthe magazines varies from 5 to 12. In the British detachable box\r\nmagazine there are ten charges. The calibres of the barrels range in the\r\ninfantry patterns of different nations from 0·256 inch to 0·315 inch;\r\nthe explosive used in every case is some kind of smokeless powder, and\r\nthis, in the cartridge for the Lee-Metford, is _cordite_. The bullets\r\nare not made simply of lead, but of lead coated with a harder metal or\r\nalloy such as steel, cupro-nickel, nickel steel, or they consist\r\nentirely of some of these alloys.\r\n\r\nAlthough the magazine rifle is now the regulation weapon of the infantry\r\nof all great armies, it is not improbable that at no distant future it\r\nmaybe superseded by one in which, as in certain machine guns, the force\r\nof the recoil will be used for actuating the breech and lock movements.\r\nMany patents have already been taken out for rifles on this principle,\r\nand several patterns have actually been constructed, in which a merely\r\nmomentary contact of the breech-piece with the end of the barrel is\r\nsufficient; the recoil of the barrel with the reaction of a spring\r\nperforms all the requisite movements with such rapidity that an amazing\r\nspeed of firing has been obtained. It is said that such an automatic gun\r\ncan send forth bullets at a perfectly amazing rate. Of course the\r\nmechanism of such a gun is somewhat intricate, and it is impossible to\r\nexplain its construction and action without a great number of diagrams\r\nand much description.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _RIFLED CANNON._\r\n\r\nHaving briefly sketched in the foregoing section the development of the\r\nmilitary rifle from such weapons as our own “Brown Bess,” down to the\r\nrepeating or magazine rifle, we now purpose to adopt a similar course\r\nwith regard to ordnance, giving also some particulars of the methods of\r\nmanufacture, etc., and following in general the order of history.\r\n\r\nNaturally there is nothing that accelerates progress in warlike\r\ninventions so much as the exigences of war itself. This is well\r\nexemplified in circumstances attending the Crimean War, which was waged\r\nin 1854 by England and France in alliance against Russia. The desire of\r\nhaving ships that could run the gauntlet of the heavy guns mounted on\r\nRussian forts led to the construction of _La Gloire_ and other\r\narmour-plated vessels, as we have already seen, and a suggestion of the\r\nFrench Emperor, as to improving metal for guns, made to Mr. Bessemer,\r\nled incidentally but ultimately to the great revolution in the\r\nmanufacture of steel, although it is true that Krupp of Essen had begun\r\nto produce small cast-steel ordnance as early as 1847. But what\r\ndetermined the necessity for rifled ordnance was more particularly the\r\ngreater comparative effects obtained by the muzzle-loading rifles over\r\nthe field artillery then in use in the several engagements that took\r\nplace in the Crimea, especially in the battle of Inkerman (1854). The\r\nrifles so much surpassed in accuracy at long ranges the smooth-bore\r\nfield-pieces firing spherical projectiles, that field artillery was on\r\nthe point of losing its relative importance, and even in the matter of\r\nrange the latter lost so much by windage that the men serving the\r\nartillery could sometimes be leisurely picked off by the rifle\r\nsharp-shooters. Inventors were soon at work on devising methods of\r\nincreasing the accuracy of ordnance fire with both light and heavy\r\npieces, and before the end of the war some cast-iron guns rifled on\r\nLancaster’s plan had been mounted on forts and in ships, without proving\r\nvery successful except in regard to increase of range when elongated\r\npointed projectiles were used with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 90.—_32–pounder, 1807._\r\n]\r\n\r\nNow let us see of what kind was the ordnance used for some years after\r\nthe middle of the century, in order that we may be the better able to\r\nappreciate the progress that has since been made. Ordnance is, as\r\nalready noticed, of several species, as guns mounted on fortresses,\r\nnaval guns, siege guns, field-guns, etc., and the size of the pieces\r\nunder each of those heads is distinguished sometimes in one, sometimes\r\nin another of three different ways. We may name it by the weight of the\r\ngun itself in tons or hundredweights, as “a 35–ton gun,” etc.; or by the\r\nweight of its projectile, as “a 68–pounder,” etc.; or by its calibre,\r\nthat is the diameter of its bore, as “a 4–inch gun,” etc. We may take\r\nthe naval guns with which Nelson won his battles (Trafalgar, 1807) as\r\nrepresentative of all except field ordnance up to about 1856. They were\r\nall made of cast iron, threw spherical projectiles, and were very rudely\r\nmounted. The gun most commonly mounted on board our ships of war was the\r\n32–pounder, weighing 32 cwt., shown with its carriage in Fig. 90. The\r\ncarriage was of wood, and consisted of two side pieces joined back and\r\nfront by two transverse pieces and carried by four low wooden wheels.\r\nThe trunnions of the gun fitted into bearings at the top of the\r\nside-pieces, and were secured by iron plates that passed over them in a\r\nsemi-cylindrical form and were bolted down to the wood. The position of\r\nthe trunnions on the gun was always such that the breech end of the gun\r\npreponderated, being supported on an adjustable wooden wedge; and when\r\nthe muzzle of the gun had to be lowered, this was done by raising the\r\nbreech end with handspikes and pushing in the wedge so far as to prevent\r\nthe breech from dropping down again. There was a vent or narrow passage\r\nto contain a train of powder from the touch-hole at the upper part of\r\nthe breech to the rear of the charge. When the gun was fired, with its\r\nmuzzle protruding a little way out of the port-hole, the recoil would\r\ntrundle it inwards about its own length, when its course would be stayed\r\nby a thick rope attached to the sides of the vessel; and by other tackle\r\nit would be kept in position until loaded, when it would be allowed to\r\nroll back, or would be drawn by ropes and pulleys out to the port-hole,\r\nand by the same means such lateral inclination as might be required\r\ncould be given. This last adjustment was called _training_ the gun. A\r\n32–pounder required the services altogether of a dozen or fourteen men,\r\nbut these by virtue of constant drill would learn to handle the clumsy\r\nmachine with a certain amount of expedition. If we except a notch on the\r\nhighest point of the muzzle, the pieces were devoid of anything of the\r\nnature of sights, though sometimes marks were made on the adjustable\r\nwedge under the breech to correspond with certain elevations. Nor were\r\nsights required; for the mode of fighting then was to get quite close to\r\nthe adversary’s ship and pour in a _broadside_ by firing simultaneously\r\nall guns on the enemy’s side when they had been _trained_ (by rough\r\nmethods), so as to concentrate their effect as much as possible on one\r\npoint of the antagonist. Nelson’s famous ship the _Victory_ carried a\r\nfew larger guns than the 32–pounders, namely, two 68–pounders, called\r\n_carronades_ (from having first been cast at Carron in Scotland), and\r\nsome 42–pounders. The 32– and 42–pounders numbered together thirty, and\r\nthere were also as many 24–pounders, with forty 12–pounders. These were\r\nall simply cast of the required dimensions, and were not made with the\r\none single improvement which after two centuries’ use of cast-iron guns\r\nhad been introduced into France about fifty years before, namely, the\r\n_boring_ of the chase out of a solid casting.\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of the Crimean War (1854) the minds of many inventors\r\nwere occupied by the problem of ordnance construction, and this also\r\nengaged the attention among others of two of the most eminent British\r\nmechanical engineers of the day. These were Sir W. Armstrong and Sir J.\r\nWhitworth, who, with others, were invited by our War Department to\r\nsubmit the best models of field and heavy guns their skill was severally\r\nable to produce. Two years afterward, Sir W. Armstrong had, after many\r\nexperiments, completed a gun of 1·88 in. calibre. This had a forged\r\nsteel barrel 6 feet in length; but it was only after eight such forgings\r\nhad been bored and rejected on account of flaws revealed only by the\r\nboring that a sound barrel was at length obtained. This barrel was\r\nstrengthened on the outside by _jackets_ made from coils of wrought iron\r\nbars welded into a piece and shrunk on while hot (of which process we\r\nshall have something more to say presently); the barrel was rifled with\r\nmany shallow grooves, and the pointed projectile, 3 calibres long, was\r\nmade of lead, for which afterwards iron coated with lead was\r\nsubstituted. This gun was a breech-loader, the breech being closed by a\r\nblock let into a slot after loading, and then pressed against the barrel\r\nby some turns of a screw which advanced parallel to the axis of the\r\npiece, and was made hollow for loading through, before the closing block\r\nwas put in. In a trial of the various pieces ready in 1857, it was found\r\nthat the Armstrong gun made as just described had an accuracy and range\r\nimmensely greater than any weapon that had ever been tested, and the\r\nGovernment authorities approved of the system of construction, except\r\nthat they preferred muzzle-loading pieces to breech-loading, as being\r\nsimpler in action, more easily kept in repair, and cheaper in original\r\ncost and ammunition.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Joseph Whitworth’s gun was, in 1863, submitted to a competitive\r\ntrial against the Armstrong, as to their endurance and mode of ultimate\r\nfailure when fired with ever-increasing charges of powder and shot, at\r\nthe forty-second round the Armstrong breech-loader split, and at the\r\nsixtieth the Armstrong muzzle-loader had one of its coils cracked; while\r\nit was not until the ninety-second round that the Whitworth gun burst\r\nviolently into eleven pieces. These competing guns were 12–pounder\r\nfield-guns weighing 8 cwts., and from each 2,800 regulation rounds had\r\nbeen fired before they were subjected to the bursting proofs. The result\r\nof these trials being that the authorities considered that steel was not\r\nthen sufficiently reliable, and they decided to adopt the system of\r\nbuilding up rifled guns with iron jackets over an inner tube of steel.\r\nSir Joseph Whitworth made his guns entirely of steel, and they were\r\nstriking examples of beautiful and accurate workmanship. His system of\r\nrifling consisted in forming the bore of the gun so that its section is\r\na regular hexagon, and the projectile is an elongated bolt with sides\r\nexactly fitting the barrel of the gun: the projectile is, in fact, a\r\ntwisted hexagonal prism. Fig. 91 shows at the left-hand side the section\r\nof the barrel, and on the right we see the form of the projectile on a\r\nsmaller scale, this last representing, in fact, the exact size and shape\r\nof the bullet of the Whitworth _rifle_ mentioned on another page. Sir\r\nJoseph’s guns were muzzle-loaders, and they were remarkable for their\r\nlong range and accuracy of fire. One of these guns, with a charge of 50\r\nlbs. of gunpowder, threw a 250–lb. shot a distance of nearly six miles,\r\nand on another occasion a 310–lb. shell was hurled through the air, and\r\nfirst touched the ground at a distance of more than six and a quarter\r\nmiles from the gun. These distances are greater than any to which shot\r\nor shell had previously been thrown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 91.—_Whitworth Rifling and Projectile._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs the material of these Whitworth guns was very costly, and very\r\nperfect workmanship was required in the formation of the barrel and the\r\nshots, the expense attending their manufacture and use was much greater\r\nthan that incurred in the case of the Armstrong guns. Sir W. Armstrong’s\r\nestimate for a 35–ton gun was £3,500, and Sir J. Whitworth’s, £6,000.\r\nThe gun, as constructed at Woolwich on Mr. Fraser’s plan, was estimated\r\nto cost £2,500. The first cost of a gun is a matter for consideration,\r\nsince each piece, even the strongest, is able only to fire a limited\r\nnumber of rounds before it becomes unsafe or useless. It appears that no\r\ncannon has yet been constructed capable of withstanding without\r\nalteration the tremendous shocks given by the explosion of the\r\ngunpowder, and these alterations, however small at any one discharge,\r\nare summed up and ultimately bring to an end what may be termed the\r\n“life of the piece.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 92.—_600–pounder Muzzle-loading Armstrong Gun._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1858 Sir William Armstrong (afterwards Lord Armstrong)\r\nestablished at Elswick, Newcastle-on-Tyne, a manufactory of ordnance,\r\nwhich has since developed into the great arsenal now so well known all\r\nover the world. Here all the resources of science have been applied to\r\nthe problems of artillery, and experiments carried on with a prodigality\r\nof cost and promptness of execution impossible at a government\r\nestablishment trammelled with official regulations. Here, and also at\r\nWoolwich, our national ordnance factory, guns have since always been\r\nconstructed on the building-up plan advocated by Sir W. Armstrong, whose\r\nprinciple consists in disposing of the fibre of the iron so as best to\r\nresist the strains in the several parts of the gun. Wrought iron being\r\nfibrous in its texture has, like wood, much more strength in the\r\ndirection of the grain than across it. The direction of the fibre in a\r\nbar of wrought iron is parallel to its length, and in that direction the\r\niron is nearly twice as strong as it is transversely. A gun may give way\r\neither by the bursting of the barrel or by the blowing out of the\r\nbreech. The force which tends to produce the first effect acts\r\ntransversely to the axis of the gun; hence the best way to resist it is\r\nto wrap the iron round the barrel, so that the fibres of the metal\r\nencircle it like the hoops of a cask. The force which tends to blow out\r\nthe breech is best resisted by disposing the fibres of the iron so as to\r\nbe parallel to the axis of the gun; hence Sir W. Armstrong makes the\r\nbreech-piece from a solid forging with the fibre in the required\r\ndirection. But the Elswick building-up principle involves much more than\r\nthe direction of the fibres of the iron, for each coil or jacket, after\r\nhaving its spires welded together, was bored out on a lathe, and the\r\nexterior of the part of the gun on which it was to be placed was also\r\nturned with the utmost exactness, so that when the enveloping piece was\r\nheated to a certain temperature and in this state brought into position,\r\nit would in cooling compress the parts it encircled just to that degree\r\nwhich careful calculations showed would best strengthen the gun without\r\nunduly straining the metal at any part. The Elswick guns being built up\r\nof several superimposed jackets of calculated lengths and thicknesses,\r\nthe means was afforded of distributing the tensions throughout the whole\r\nmass of metal to the best advantage. In the simpler form, arranged by\r\nMr. Fraser, and for the sake of economy adopted by the authorities at\r\nWoolwich in 1867, the greater part of the benefit derivable from\r\nadjustment of tension was no doubt sacrificed to cheapness of\r\nmanufacture. These, and also the forms of Armstrong guns that have not\r\nyet been described, ceased to be made after 1880, by which time steel\r\nhad replaced iron in every part of the construction and fittings of\r\nguns, and muzzle-loading had been definitely abandoned in favour of\r\nbreech-loading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 93.—_35–ton Fraser Gun._\r\n]\r\n\r\nNow, in 1874, when the first edition of the present work was in\r\npreparation, the Fraser-Woolwich guns were in full vogue, being spoken\r\nof by the public press as the _ne plus ultra_ of artillery construction\r\nin size, efficiency, and economy. When, accordingly, the author had been\r\nprivileged to visit the arsenal and witness the production of these guns\r\nin every stage of their manufacture, he wrote a description of it which\r\nis here retained as printed at the time, seeing that it may not be\r\nwithout historical interest, particularly since great numbers of these\r\nguns must still be extant, mounted on our forts in various parts of the\r\nworld, and seeing also that the description of the simpler formations\r\nmay render more easily to be understood future references to similar\r\noperations in gun-making as have been retained in the later\r\ndevelopments. Of course, the following description was written in the\r\n_present tense_, and therefore in perusing it the reader must constantly\r\nbear in mind that the guns with which our ships of war have since been\r\nequipped are in _every respect entirely different_ from\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _The Fraser-Woolwich Guns, 1867–1880._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 94.—_Section of 9 in. Fraser Gun._\r\n]\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1867 the guns made at Woolwich were constructed according\r\nto the original plan proposed by Sir W. Armstrong, and on this system\r\none of the large guns consisted of as many as thirteen separate pieces.\r\nThese guns, though unexceptionable as to strength and efficiency, were\r\nnecessarily so very costly that it became a question whether anything\r\ncould be done to lessen the expense by a simpler mode of construction or\r\nby greater economy in the material. The problem was solved in the most\r\nsatisfactory manner by Mr. Fraser, of the Royal Gun Factory, who\r\nproposed an important modification of the original plan, and the\r\nadoption of a kind of iron cheaper than had been previously employed,\r\nyet perfectly suited for the purpose. Mr. Fraser’s modification\r\nconsisted in building up the guns from only a few coils, instead of\r\nseveral, the coils being longer than Sir W. Armstrong’s, and the iron\r\ncoiled upon itself two or even three times: a plan which enabled him to\r\nsupersede the breech-piece, formerly made in one large forging, by a\r\npiece formed of coils. In order to perceive the increased simplicity of\r\nconstruction introduced by Mr. Fraser, we need but glance at the section\r\nof a 9 in. gun constructed according to his system, Fig. 94, and\r\nremember that a piece of the same size made after the original plan had\r\nten distinct parts, whereas the Fraser is seen to have but four. Compare\r\nalso Figs. 92 and 93. We shall now describe the process of making the\r\nFraser 9 in. gun. The parts of the gun as shown in the section, Fig. 94,\r\nare: 1, the steel barrel; 2, the B tube; 3, the breech-coil; 4, the\r\ncascable screw. The inner steel barrel is made from a solid cylinder of\r\nsteel, which is supplied by Messrs. Firth, of Sheffield. This steel is\r\nforged from a cast block, the casting being necessary in order to obtain\r\na uniform mass, while the subsequent forging imparts to it greater\r\nsolidity and elasticity. After the cylinder has been examined, and the\r\nsuitable character of the steel tested by trials with portions cut from\r\nit, the block is roughly turned and bored, and is then ready for the\r\ntoughening process. This consists in heating the tube several hours to a\r\ncertain temperature in an upright furnace, and then suddenly plunging it\r\ninto oil, in which it is allowed to remain for a day. By this treatment\r\nthe tenacity of the metal is marvellously increased. A bar of the steel\r\n1 in. square previous to this process, if subjected to a pull equal to\r\nthe weight of 13 tons, begins to stretch and will not again recover its\r\noriginal form when the tension is removed, and when a force of 31 tons\r\nis applied it breaks. But the forces required to affect the toughened\r\nsteel in a similar manner are 31 tons and 50 tons respectively. The\r\nprocess, unfortunately, is not without some disadvantages, for the\r\nbarrel is liable to become slightly distorted and even superficially\r\ncracked. Such cracks are removed by again turning and boring; the\r\nhardness the steel acquires by the toughening process being shown by the\r\nfact that in the first boring 8¼ in. diameter of _solid_ steel is cut\r\nout in 56 hours, yet for this slight boring, in which merely a thin\r\nlayer is peeled off, 25 hours are required; and lest there should be any\r\nfissures in the metal, which, though not visible to the eye, might make\r\nthe barrel unsound, it is filled with water, which is subjected to a\r\npressure of 8,000 lbs. per square inch. If under this enormous pressure\r\nno water is forced outwards, the barrel is considered safe. It is now\r\nready to have the B tube shrunk on it.\r\n\r\nThe B tube, like certain other portions of these guns, is constructed\r\nfrom coiled iron bars, and this constitutes one great peculiarity of Sir\r\nW. Armstrong’s system. It has the immense advantage of disposing the\r\nmetal so that its fibres encircle the piece, thus applying the strength\r\nof the iron in the most effective way. The bars from which the coils are\r\nprepared are made from “scrap” iron, such as old nails, horse-shoes, &c.\r\nA pile of such fragments, built up on a wooden framework, is placed in a\r\nfurnace and intensely heated. When withdrawn the scraps have by\r\nsemi-fusion become coherent, and under the steam hammer are soon welded\r\ninto a compact mass of wrought iron, roughly shaped as a square prism.\r\nThe glowing mass is now introduced into the rolling-mill, and in a few\r\nminutes it is rolled out, as if it were so much dough, into a long bar\r\nof iron. In order to form this into a coil it is placed in a very long\r\nfurnace, where it can be heated its entire length. When sufficiently\r\nheated, one end of the bar is seized and attached to an iron core of the\r\nrequired diameter, and the core being made to revolve by a steam engine,\r\nthe bar is drawn out of the furnace, winding round the core in a close\r\nspiral, so that the turns are in contact. The coil is again intensely\r\nheated, and in this condition a few strokes of the steam hammer in the\r\ndirection of its axis suffice to combine the spires of the coil into one\r\nmass, thus forming a hollow cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe B tube for the 9 in. gun is formed of two double coils. When the two\r\nportions have been completely welded together under the steam hammer,\r\nthe tube, after cooling, is roughly turned and bored. It is again fine\r\nbored to the required diameter, and a register of the diameter every few\r\ninches down the bore is made. These measurements are taken for the\r\npurpose of adapting most accurately the dimensions of the steel barrel\r\nto the bore of the B tube, as it is found that perfect exactness is more\r\neasily obtained in turning than in boring. The steel barrel is therefore\r\nagain turned to a size slightly _larger_ than the bore of the B tube,\r\nand is then placed muzzle end upwards, and so arranged that a stream of\r\nwater, to keep it cool, shall pass into it and out again at the muzzle,\r\nby means of a syphon, while the B tube, which has been heated until it\r\nis sufficiently expanded, is passed over it and gradually cooled.\r\n\r\nIf now the B tube were allowed to cool spontaneously, its ends would, by\r\ncooling more rapidly than the central part, contract upon the steel\r\nbarrel and grip it firmly at points which the subsequent cooling would\r\ntend to draw nearer together longitudinally, and thus the barrel would\r\nbe subjected to injurious strains. In order to prevent this, the B tube\r\nis made to cool progressively from the breech end, by means of jets of\r\nwater made to fall upon it, and gradually raised towards the muzzle end,\r\nwhich has in the meanwhile been prevented from shrinking by having\r\ncircles of gas-flames playing upon it.\r\n\r\nThe breech-coil, or jacket, is formed of three pieces welded together.\r\nFirst, there is a triple coil made of bars 4 in. square, the middle one\r\nbeing coiled in the reverse direction to the other two. After having\r\nbeen intensely heated in a furnace for ten hours, a few blows on its end\r\nfrom a powerful steam hammer welds its coils perpendicularly, and when a\r\nsolid core has been introduced, and the mass has been well hammered on\r\nthe sides, it becomes a compact cylinder of wrought iron, with the\r\nfibres all running round it. When cold it is placed in the lathe, and\r\nthe muzzle end is turned down, leaving a shoulder to receive the\r\ntrunnion-ring. The C coil is double, welded in a similar manner to the B\r\ncoil, and it has a portion turned off, so that it may be enclosed by the\r\ntrunnion-ring.\r\n\r\nThe trunnion-ring is made by punching a hole in a slab of heated iron\r\nfirst by a small conical mandrel, and then enlarging by repeating the\r\nprocess with larger and larger mandrels. The iron is heated for each\r\noperation, and the trunnions are at the same time hammered on and\r\nroughly shaped—or, rather, only one has to be hammered on—for a portion\r\nof the bar which serves to hold the mass forms the other. The\r\ntrunnion-ring is then bored out, and after having been heated to\r\nredness, is dropped on to the triple breech-coil which is placed muzzle\r\nend up, and the turned end of the C coil (of course, not heated) is then\r\nimmediately placed within the upper part of the trunnion-ring. The\r\nlatter in cooling contracts so forcibly as to bind the ends of the coils\r\ntogether, and the whole can thus be placed in a furnace and heated to a\r\nhigh temperature, so that when removed and put under the steam hammer,\r\nits parts are readily wielded into one mass. The breech-coil in this\r\nstate weighs about 16 tons; but so much metal is removed by the\r\nsubsequent turnings and borings, that it is reduced to nearly half that\r\nweight in the gun. It is then turned in a lathe of the most massive\r\nconstruction, which weighs more than 100 tons. Fig. 34, page 95, is from\r\na drawing taken at Woolwich, and shows one of the large guns in the\r\nlathe. No one who witnesses this operation can fail to be struck with\r\nthe apparent ease with which this powerful tool removes thick flakes of\r\nmetal as if it were so much cheese. The projections of the trunnions\r\nprevent the part in which they are situated from being finished in this\r\nlathe, and the gun has to be placed in another machine, where the\r\nsuperfluous metal of the trunnion-ring is pared off by a tool moving\r\nparallel to the axis of the piece. Another machine accomplishes the\r\nturning of the trunnions, the “jacket” being made to revolve about their\r\naxis. The jacket is then accurately bored out with an enlargement or\r\nsocket to receive the end of the B tube, and a hollow screw is cut at\r\nthe breech end for the cascable.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the gun, consisting of the steel barrel with the B tube\r\nshrunk on it, having been placed upright with the muzzle downwards, the\r\nbreech-piece, strongly heated, is brought over it by a travelling crane,\r\nand slips over the steel barrel, while the recess in it receives the end\r\nof the B tube. Cold water is forced up into the inside of the barrel in\r\norder to keep it cool. As the breech cools, which it is allowed to do\r\nspontaneously, it contracts and grips the barrel and B tube with great\r\nforce. The cascable requires to be very carefully fitted. It is this\r\npiece which plays so important a part in resisting the force tending to\r\nblow out the end of the barrel. The cascable is a solid screw formed of\r\nthe very best iron, and its inner end is wrought by scraping and filing,\r\nso that when screwed in there may be perfect contact between its face\r\nand the end of the steel barrel. A small annular space is left at the\r\ncircumference of the inner end, communicating through a small opening\r\nwith the outside. The object of this is, that in case of rupture of the\r\nsteel barrel, the gases escaping through it may give timely warning of\r\nthe state of the piece.\r\n\r\nBesides minor operations, there remain the important processes of\r\nfinishing the boring, and of rifling. The boring is effected in two\r\noperations, and after that the interior is gauged in every part, and\r\n“lapping” is resorted to where required, in order to obtain the perfect\r\nform. Lapping consists in wearing down the steel by friction against\r\nfine emery powder and oil, spread on a leaden surface. The piece is then\r\nready for rifling. The machinery by which the rifling is performed\r\ncannot be surpassed for its admirable ingenuity and simplicity.\r\n\r\nIn this operation the gun is fixed horizontally, its axis coinciding\r\nwith that of the bar, which carries the grooving tools. This bar is\r\ncapable of two independent movements, one backwards and forwards in a\r\nstraight line in the direction of the length of the bar, and the other a\r\nrotation round its axis. The former is communicated by a screw parallel\r\nto the bar, and working in a nut attached to the end of it. For the\r\nrotatory movement the bar carries a pinion, which is engaged by a rack\r\nplaced horizontally and perpendicularly to the bar, and partaking of its\r\nbackward and forward movement, but arranged so that its end must move\r\nalong another bar placed at an angle with the former. It is this angle\r\nwhich determines the pitch of the rifling, and by substituting a curved\r\nguide-bar for the straight one, an increasing twist may be obtained in\r\nthe grooves.\r\n\r\nThe projectile used with these guns is of a cylindrical form, but\r\npointed at the head, and the moulds in which these shots are cast are so\r\narranged that the head of the shot is moulded in iron, while the body is\r\nsurrounded with sand. The rapid cooling induced by the contact of the\r\ncold metal causes the head of the shot to solidify very quickly, so that\r\nthe carbon in the iron is not separated as in ordinary casting. In\r\nconsequence of this treatment, the head of the shot possesses the\r\nhardness of steel, and is therefore well adapted for penetrating iron\r\nplates or other structures. The projectiles are turned in a lathe to the\r\nexact size, and then shallow circular cavities are bored in them, and\r\ninto these cavities brass studs, which are simply short cylinders of a\r\ndiameter slightly larger than the cavities, are forced by pressure. The\r\nprojecting studs are then turned so as accurately to fit the spiral\r\ngrooves of the guns. Thus the projectile in traversing the bore of the\r\npiece is forced to make a revolution, or part of a revolution, about its\r\naxis, and the rapid rotation thus imparted has the effect of keeping the\r\naxis of the missile always parallel to its original direction. Thus\r\nvastly increased accuracy of firing is obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 95.—_Millwall Shield after being battered with Heavy Shot.—Front\r\n    View._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 96.—_Rear View of the Millwall Shield._\r\n]\r\n\r\nShells are also used with the Woolwich rifled guns. The shells are of\r\nthe same shape as the solid shots, from which they differ in being cast\r\nhollow, and having their interior filled with gunpowder. Such shells\r\nwhen used against iron structures require no fuse; they explode in\r\ncoming into collision with their object. In other cases, however, the\r\nshells are provided with fuses, which cause the explosion when the shot\r\nstrikes. Fig. 93, page 195, represents one of the 35–ton guns, made on\r\nthe plan introduced by Mr. Fraser. This piece of ordnance is 16 ft.\r\nlong, 4 ft. 3 in. in diameter at the breech, and 1 ft. 9 in. at the\r\nmuzzle. The bore is about 1 ft. Each gun can throw a shot or bolt 700\r\nlbs. in weight, with a charge of 120 lbs. of powder. It is stated that\r\nthe shot, if fired at a short range, would penetrate a plate of iron 14\r\nin. thick, and that at a distance of 2,000 yards it would retain\r\nsufficient energy to go through a plate 12 in. thick. The effect of\r\nthese ponderous missiles upon thick iron plates is very remarkable.\r\nTargets or shields have been constructed with plates and timber backing,\r\ngirders, &c., put together in the strongest possible manner, in order to\r\ntest the resisting power of the armour plating and other constructions\r\nof our ironclad ships. The above two cuts, Figs. 95 and 96, are\r\nrepresentations of the appearance of the front and back of a very strong\r\nshield of this description, after having been struck with a few 600 lb.\r\nshots fired from the 25–ton gun. The shots with chilled heads, already\r\nreferred to, sometimes were found to penetrate completely through the 8\r\nin. front plate, and the 6 in. of solid teak, and the 6 in. of plating\r\nat the back. The shield, though strongly constructed with massive plates\r\nof iron, only served to prove the relative superiority of the artillery\r\nof that day, which was at the time when our century had yet about thirty\r\nyears to run. Up to 1876 no confidence was placed in steel as a\r\nresisting material, a circumstance perhaps not much to be wondered at,\r\nas its capabilities had not then been developed by the newer processes\r\nof manufacture, described in our article on Iron; nor had mechanicians\r\nacquired the power of operating with large masses of the metal. Since\r\nthen it has come about that only steel is relied upon for efficiently\r\nresisting the penetration of projectiles, iron being held of no account\r\nexcept as a backing. There has always been a rivalry between the\r\nartillerist and the naval constructor, and this contest between the\r\nattacking and the defending agencies is well illustrated in the table on\r\npage 166, where the parallel advance in the destructive power of guns\r\nand in the resisting power of our war-ships is exhibited in a numerical\r\nform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 97.—_Comparative Sizes of 35 and 81 ton Guns._\r\n\r\n  A, 35–ton; B, 81–ton.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe 35–ton Fraser guns were at the time of their production humorously\r\ncalled in the newspapers “Woolwich infants”; but it was not long before\r\nthey might in another sense be called infants in comparison with a still\r\nlarger gun of 81 tons weight constructed at Woolwich shortly before\r\niron-coiling and muzzle-loading were set aside. Fig. 97 shows the\r\nrelative dimensions of the 35–ton and 81–ton guns: the latter was built\r\nup in the same way as the 9–inch gun described above, but the coils were\r\nnecessarily longer and the chase was formed in three parts instead of\r\ntwo. The total length of this gun was 27 feet, and the bore was about 24\r\nfeet long and 14 in. in diameter, and the weight of the shot about 1000\r\nlbs., with sufficient energy to penetrate at a considerable distance an\r\niron plate 20 in. in thickness. It was for the manufacture of these very\r\nlarge guns that the great steam hammer, represented in Plate III., was\r\nerected at Woolwich.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe 81–ton gun was the largest muzzle-loader ever made in the national\r\ngun factory at the time when such huge weapons were in request; but in\r\n1876 its dimensions were surpassed by those of a few 100–ton guns built\r\nat Elswick to the order of the Italian Government for mounting on their\r\nmost formidable ironclads. These guns have a calibre of 17·72 inches,\r\nand are provided with a chamber of somewhat larger bore to receive the\r\ncharge of powder. They are built up on the Armstrong shrinkage\r\nprinciple, and comprise as many as twenty different tubes, jackets,\r\nhoops, screws, etc., and are undoubtedly the most powerful\r\nmuzzle-loading weapons ever constructed. It happened, just as these guns\r\nwere completed, that the British Government, apprehensive at the time of\r\na war with Russia, exercised its rights of purchasing two of them, one\r\nto be mounted at Gibraltar, the other at Malta.\r\n\r\nThe Elswick establishment soon afterwards surpassed all its former\r\nachievements in building great guns, by designing and constructing the\r\nhuge breech-loaders, one of which forms the subject of our Plate XII.\r\nThese are known as the Armstrong 110–ton guns; they are formed of solid\r\nsteel throughout, and their weight is accurately 247,795 lbs., or 110\r\ntons 12 cwts. 51 lbs. The total length of the gun is 43 ft. 8 in., and\r\nof this 40 ft. 7 in. is occupied by the bore, along which the rifling\r\nextends 33 ft. 1 in. The calibre of the rifled part is 16¼ in., and the\r\ndiameter of the powder chamber is somewhat greater. The regulation\r\ncharge of powder weighs 960 lbs., although the guns are tested with\r\nstill greater charges. The weight of the projectile is 1,800 lbs., and\r\nit leaves the muzzle with a velocity of 2,128 ft. per second, which is\r\nequivalent to a dynamical energy of 56,520 foot-tons. What this means\r\nwill perhaps be better understood, not by describing experiments such as\r\nthose on the Millwall Shield, the results of which are depicted in Figs.\r\n95 and 96, but by stating that if the shot from the 110–ton gun\r\nencountered a solid wall of wrought iron a yard thick, it would pass\r\nthrough it. The Elswick 110–ton gun is, in fact, the most powerful piece\r\nof ordnance that has ever been constructed. There are no trunnions to\r\nthese great guns, but they are encircled by massive rings of metal,\r\nbetween which pass strong steel bands that tie the gun to its carriage,\r\nor, rather, to the heavy steel frame on which it is mounted, and which\r\nslides on a couple of girders. The force of the recoil acts on a\r\nhydraulic ram that passes through the lower part of the supporting\r\nframe. The whole working of the gun is done by hydraulic power, and,\r\nindeed, the same method has been applied by the Elswick firm to the\r\nhandling of all heavy guns. By hydraulic power, maintained automatically\r\nby a pumping engine exercising a pressure of from 800 lbs. to 1,000 lbs.\r\nper square inch, are operated the whole of the movements required for\r\nbringing the cartridge and the projectile from the magazine; for\r\nunscrewing the breech block, withdrawing it, and moving it aside; for\r\npushing home the shot and the cartridge to their places in the bore; for\r\nclosing the breech and screwing up the block; for rotating the turret\r\nwithin which the gun is mounted, or in other cases for ramming the piece\r\nin or out, and for elevating or depressing it. It is, indeed, obvious\r\nthat such ponderous masses of metal as form the barrels and projectiles\r\nof these 110–ton and other guns of the larger sizes could not be handled\r\nto advantage by any of the ordinary mechanical appliances. But by the\r\napplication of the hydraulic principle, a very few men are able to work\r\nthe largest guns with the greatest ease, for their personal labour is\r\nthus reduced to the mere manipulation of levers. On board ship the power\r\nrequired for working large guns has lately been sometimes supplied by a\r\nsystem of shafting driven by a steam engine and provided with drums and\r\npulleys, exactly as in an engineer’s workshop. Great care has also been\r\nbestowed upon the mounting of the smaller guns, which are so nicely\r\npoised on their bearings and provided with such accurately fitted racks,\r\npinions, etc., that a steel gun of 10 ft. in length can easily be\r\npointed in any direction by the touch of a child’s hand. The mechanical\r\narrangements are now so admirably adapted for facility of working that,\r\nunless in the rude shocks of actual warfare the nicely adjusted\r\nmachinery is found to be liable to be thrown out of gear, these\r\napplications of the engineer’s skill may be considered as having done\r\nall that was required to bring our modern weapons to perfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XII.\r\n\r\n  THE 110–TON ARMSTRONG GUN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWith the construction of the 110–ton we arrive at a period when\r\ncommences a new era in guns—and especially in the armament of\r\nwar-ships—necessitated by various circumstances, amongst which may be\r\nnamed the invention of torpedoes and the building of swiftly moving\r\ntorpedo-boats, and of still swifter “torpedo-boat catchers or\r\ndestroyers”; so that guns that could be worked only at comparatively\r\nlong intervals were at a great disadvantage. Again, about 1880, were\r\npublished the records of a most elaborate and important series of\r\nresearches conducted by Captain Noble and Sir F. Abel, the chemist of\r\nour War Department. They had investigated all the conditions attending\r\nthe combustion of gunpowder in confined spaces, the nature and\r\nquantities of the products, the temperature and pressures of the\r\nconfined gases, etc. The information thus afforded was extremely\r\nvaluable; but besides this, direct experiments made with actual guns\r\nwere carried out, more particularly at Elswick, in which the speed of\r\nthe projectiles at every few inches of their travel along the bore of\r\nthe piece was ascertained, and also the pressures of the powder gases at\r\nany point. The way in which this is done we shall explain on another\r\npage. (_See article on Recording Instruments._)\r\n\r\nSo long as muzzle-loading was in use, guns were necessarily made short,\r\nfor had they not to be run in from the port-holes and embrasures of\r\nforts in order to be loaded? Now there was an obvious disadvantage in\r\nthis, for the projectile left the gun before the expansive force of the\r\ngases had been spent that could have imparted additional velocity. When\r\nhowever muzzle-loading was abandoned, and especially when strong and\r\ntrustworthy steel became available for the construction of the gun\r\nthroughout, there was no reason to waste in this way the power of the\r\ncharge, so that barrels were made lighter, much longer in proportion to\r\nthe calibre, and every part accurately adapted in strength to the strain\r\nto be resisted. For instances of increasing length, take the 38–ton\r\n12–inch guns built up at Woolwich (of only seven pieces) for H.M.S.\r\n_Thunderer_ (see Fig. 93), on Mr. Fraser’s plan. These had a bore equal\r\nto only 16 times their calibre, while in the Armstrong 100–ton guns the\r\nbore is 21 calibres long; and in the 110–ton guns the total length of\r\nthe chase is 31 times the diameter of the rifled part. It has since been\r\nthe practice to make the bore of guns from 30 to 40 calibres in length.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a longer chase used with an appropriate charge is very\r\nclearly and instructively shown by the diagram Fig. 98, which is by\r\npermission copied from the very comprehensive work by Messrs. E. W.\r\nLloyd and A. G. Hadcock, entitled _Artillery: its Progress and Present\r\nPosition_. The reader should not pass over this diagram until he has\r\nthoroughly understood it, for it is an excellent example of the graphic\r\nmethod of presenting the results of scientific investigations. At the\r\nlower part of the diagram there are drawn to scale half-sections of a\r\nlong and of a short gun. The horizontal line above is marked in equal\r\nparts representing feet numbered from the base of the projectiles. The\r\nupright line on the left numbered at every fourth division is the scale\r\nfor the pressures in tons per square inch on the base of the projectile,\r\nand these are represented by the height of the plain curves above the\r\nhorizontal line at each point in the travel of the shot. The dotted\r\nlines represent in the same way, but _not_ on the same scale as the\r\nformer, the velocity with which the base of the projectile passes every\r\npoint in the chase. The figures 2, 4, and 6 on the upright line at the\r\nright-hand side refer only to pressures: the velocities scale is such\r\nthat the point where the dotted meets the right-hand one is 2,680 units\r\nabove the horizontal line, as the middle upright in the same way is\r\n1,561 high, and the heights of the dotted lines represent each on the\r\nsame scale the velocities of the bases of the projectiles at the\r\ncorresponding parts of the chases. The shorter gun has the rifled part\r\nof the chase 15·4 calibres long; the corresponding part of the longer is\r\nnearly 33 calibres. The short 7–inch gun has a charge of 30 lbs. of\r\ngunpowder, and its projectile weighed 115 lbs. The longer 6–inch gun was\r\nnot charged with gunpowder, but with the more powerful modern explosive\r\n_cordite_ (see Index), of which there was 19·5 lbs., and its projectile\r\nweighed 100 lbs. The charges were so adjusted that the shots had the\r\nsame initial maximum pressure of 20 tons per square inch applied to\r\nthem. Now the cordite, though much more powerful than gunpowder (that\r\nis, a given weight will produce far more gas), is slower in its\r\nignition, continuing longer to supply gas. The maximum pressure, 20 tons\r\nin both cases, is suddenly attained by the gunpowder gases, when the\r\nshot has hardly moved 6 inches onward, and the pressure declines rapidly\r\nas the moving shot leaves more space for the gas; while the cordite\r\ngases produce their greatest pressure more gradually at a part where the\r\nshot is already about 20 inches on its way, and not only do their\r\nhighest pressures continue for a greater distance,—but the decline is\r\nfar less rapid than in the other case. It will be observed by the\r\nintersection of the dotted lines, that when the shots in each case have\r\nmoved about 2 ft. their velocities are equal. They finally leave the\r\nmuzzles with the velocities marked on the diagram, and if the reader\r\nwill apply the formula given on page 174 he will obtain their respective\r\nenergies in _foot-lbs._; but for large amounts like these it is more\r\nusual to state the energy in _foot-tons_, which of course will be\r\narrived at by dividing the _foot-lbs._ numbers by 2,240, and these will\r\nwork out in the one case to 4978·9 ft.-tons, and in the other to 1942·5\r\nft.-tons. The shot from the long gun will therefore have more than 2½\r\ntimes the destructive power of the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 98.—_Diagram of Velocities and Pressure._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe operations required in constructing guns are multiform, and have to\r\nbe very carefully conducted so that the workmanship shall be of the best\r\nquality. The finest ores are selected for reduction, and the steel is\r\nobtained by the Siemens-Martin process already described. It must be\r\nfree from sulphur and phosphorus, and contain such proportions of\r\ncarbon, silicon, and manganese as experience has shown to be best, and\r\nits composition is ascertained by careful chemical analysis before it is\r\nused. The fluid steel is run into large ladles lined with fire-brick,\r\nand provided with an opening in the bottom from which the metal can be\r\nallowed to run out into the _ingot_ moulds, the size and proportions of\r\nthese being in accordance with the object required; some admitting of as\r\nmuch as 80 tons at one operation. When a barrel or hoop is required of\r\nnot less than 6 inches internal diameter the ingot is cut to the\r\nrequired length and roughly bored. The ingot is then heated, a long\r\ncylindrical steel bar is put through the hole, and under a hydraulic\r\npress the hot metal is squeezed into greater length and less diameter.\r\nThe hole first bored through the ingot is of somewhat greater, and the\r\nsteel bar (called a mandril) of less, diameter than required in the\r\nfinished piece. Portions are cut from each end of what is now called the\r\n_forging_ and subjected to mechanical tests: if these are satisfactory,\r\nthe forging is rough bored and turned on the outside. It is then\r\nannealed, by being heated and allowed to cool very slowly. The next\r\noperation is to _harden_ the metal by raising it to a certain\r\ntemperature, at which it is immersed in rape oil until cold. Then the\r\npiece is again annealed, and fine-turned and bored. All these operations\r\nhave to be performed not only on the barrel, but also on each hoop,\r\nbefore the hoops are shrunk on, and the greatest nicety of measurement\r\nis required in each piece. Then the gun has to be turned on the outside,\r\nthe screw for the breech piece cut, the bore rifled, etc. The object of\r\nthe annealing is to relieve the metal from internal strains. It will not\r\nbe wondered at that months are required for the construction of the\r\nlarger kind of guns. Thus at Elswick a 6 in. quick firing gun, upon\r\nwhich men are employed night and day, cannot be completed in less than\r\nfive months, and sixteen months are required for making a 67–ton gun.\r\n\r\nWe may take as an illustration of the progress of modern artillery one\r\nof the products of the Elswick factory which has just been referred to,\r\nand for which the demand from all quarters has been unprecedentedly\r\ngreat, namely, the 4·7 inch gun. This weapon is mounted in various\r\nmanners according to the position it has to occupy, whether for a land\r\ndefence, or on ship-board between decks, or on the upper deck. The\r\narrangement shown in Fig. 99, which is reproduced from Messrs. Lloyd &\r\nHadcock’s work, is known as the centre pivot mounting, and is suitable\r\nfor such a position as the upper deck of a ship. The reader should\r\ncompare the proportions and mounting of this weapon with those of the\r\nold 32–pounder sketched in Fig. 90, observing the very much greater\r\ncomparative length of the modern weapon, and the mechanism for elevating\r\nand training it (which, however, the scale of the drawing crowds into\r\ntoo small a space to show as it deserves). C is a projection from the\r\nbreech, to which is attached the piston of the recoil press; at T is the\r\nhandle for training, which actuates a worm at V; the elevation is\r\nregulated by the turning of the four-armed wheel. The long chase of the\r\ngun projects in front; but the mounting and the breech machinery are\r\nprotected by shields of thick steel, of which the sections of two plates\r\nare denoted by the dark upright parts in front. These are fixed; but a\r\nmovable plate above the gun can be raised or lowered into an inclined\r\nposition, for better taking sights. In the figure this is shown as open\r\nand in a horizontal position. This gun is provided with sights by which\r\nit can be aimed at night; that is, the sights can be illuminated by\r\nsmall electric lamps suitably placed; the wires connecting these with\r\nvoltaic battery cells carried on the mounting are indicated. The figure\r\nrepresents the gun as constructed about 1893, but the improvements that\r\nare continually being made have brought about some modifications in the\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 99.—_Elswick 4·7 inch Q. F. Gun on Pivot Mounting._\r\n]\r\n\r\nVery notable among the productions of the great Elswick factory are the\r\n_quick firing_ guns. These were at first confined to guns of small\r\ncalibre, such as the 6–pounders. They are, of course, all\r\nbreech-loaders, and the powder and shot are both contained in a single\r\nmetallic cartridge case. A more formidable weapon of the same class is\r\nthe 45–pounder rapid firing gun, which, like the rest, is constructed\r\nentirely of steel, with a total length of 16 ft. 2½ in., a calibre of\r\n4·724 in., and a length of bore equal to 40 diameters. The weight of\r\nthis gun is 41 cwt., and it throws a shell of 45 lbs. weight with a\r\n12–lb. charge of gunpowder. Quick firing guns having a calibre of 6 in.\r\nare now also made in great numbers for arming our ironclads. The breech\r\nblock in the quick firing guns turns aside on a hinge, and after the\r\nintroduction of the cartridge it is closed and screwed up to its place\r\nby a slight turn of a handle. The piece is then pointed and trained by\r\naid of mechanical gearing as in the case of the heavier guns. But Mr.\r\nHotchkiss has introduced a simpler method of elevating and training his\r\n3–pounder and 6–pounder quick firing guns, by attaching to the rear, and\r\nunaffected by the recoil, a shoulder piece against which the marksman\r\ncan lean, and move the weapon as he takes his aim. Though these guns\r\nweigh respectively 4½ cwt. and 7 cwt., they can thus be pointed with the\r\ngreatest ease. The firing is done by pulling a trigger in what seems\r\nlike the stock of a pistol. The empty cartridge case is automatically\r\nextracted from the firing chamber by the act of opening the breech, and\r\nit drops to the ground. Ten or twelve rounds per minute can be fired\r\nfrom these guns, and Lord Armstrong has advocated the use of a number of\r\nthem for naval armament in preference to that of a few ordinary\r\nbreech-loaders of more unwieldy dimensions. He has calculated that in a\r\ngiven time a far greater weight of metal can be projected from a vessel\r\narmed with quick firing guns than from one provided only with the\r\nheavier class of cannons.\r\n\r\nThe breech pieces in the Elswick guns are closed on the “interrupted\r\nscrew” system—that is, a very large screw thread of V-shaped section is\r\ncut in the barrel at the breech end, and a corresponding thread on the\r\nprincipal part of the breech block, which is, of course, capable of\r\nrotating about the axis. The screw threads, however, are not continuous,\r\nsegments parallel to the axis being cut away, the spaces in the outer\r\nthread corresponding with the projecting parts in the inner, and _vice\r\nversâ_, so that when the block is pushed home, one very small part of a\r\nturn suffices to engage all the threads. The screw is also made conical,\r\nand is so cut into steps, as it were, that great resisting power is\r\nbrought into play. The Elswick guns are provided with hydraulic buffers\r\nfor checking the recoil, and the principle is applied in various\r\nmodified forms. In some cases the pistons allow for the water a passage,\r\nwhich towards the end gradually diminishes. This is the arrangement for\r\nthe 3–pounder rapid firing Hotchkiss gun, and the force of the recoil is\r\nmade at the same time to compress two springs, which serve to return the\r\ngun to the firing position. This very handy gun is said to be able to\r\nfire twenty rounds per minute. In Mr. Vavasseur’s plan of mounting, the\r\nrecoil is checked by ports, or openings, in the piston of a hydraulic\r\ncylinder being gradually closed, which is easily arranged by making a\r\nspiral groove within the cylinder, which gives a small axial motion to\r\npart of the piston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 100.—_The Moncrieff Gun raised and ready for firing._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 101.—_Moncrieff Gun lowered for loading._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn extremely effective plan for the defence of coasts and harbours was\r\noriginated by Colonel Moncrieff, when about 1863 he contrived a method\r\nof mounting large guns on the disappearing system, by which almost\r\ncomplete protection against hostile fire is given to both gun and\r\ngunners. He utilizes the recoil as a means of bringing the gun down into\r\na protected position the moment it has been fired, and retains this\r\nenergy by a simple arrangement until the piece has been reloaded, when\r\nit is allowed to expend itself by again raising the gun above the\r\nparapet into the original firing position. The configuration and action\r\nof Colonel Moncrieff’s gun-carriage will be understood by an inspection\r\nof the annexed illustrations, where in Fig. 100 is shown the gun raised\r\nabove the parapet and ready for firing. When the discharge takes place,\r\nthe gun, if free, would move backwards with a certain speed, but the\r\ndisposition of the mounting is such that this initial velocity receives\r\nno _sudden_ check, the force being expended in raising a heavy\r\ncounterpoise, and at the same time the gun is permitted to descend,\r\nwhile maintaining a direction parallel to its firing position. At the\r\nend of the descent, which, it must be understood, is caused by the force\r\nof the recoil, and not by the counterpoise, for this more than balances\r\nthe weight of the gun, the latter is retained as shown in Fig. 101 until\r\nit has been reloaded; and when it has again to be fired, it is released\r\nso as to allow the descent of the counterpoise to raise it once more\r\ninto position. The great advantage of this invention is the protection\r\nafforded to the artillerymen and gun while loading; and even the aiming\r\ncan be accomplished by mirrors, so that the men are exposed to no\r\ndanger, except from “vertical fire,” which involves but little risk.\r\n\r\nColonel Moncrieff took out a patent for his invention in 1864, but\r\ncommitted the practical working out of his idea to the firm of Sir W. G.\r\nArmstrong & Co., in whose hands the design was ultimately transformed\r\nfrom the original somewhat cumbersome arrangement of the mounting into\r\nthe compact and manageable form shown in Fig. 102, which represents a\r\n13·9 inch 68–ton breech-loading disappearing gun on the Elswick\r\nhydro-pneumatic mounting. The principle of hydraulic power is fully\r\nexplained in our article on that subject, and an example of its\r\napplication to cranes as devised by Sir W. Armstrong is there described.\r\nWhen guns began to be made very large, and projectiles weighing several\r\ncwts. had to be dealt with, the application of power in some form became\r\nessential for loading, running out, elevating, training, etc.; and\r\nthough steam-power naturally was first used, hydraulic power was adopted\r\nat Elswick, and has been there applied to the mountings of large guns\r\nwith the greatest success by Mr. G. W. Rendel. To mention the various\r\narrangements in which this power is applied, or to attempt any\r\ndescription of the elaborate machinery by which it is regulated, would\r\ncarry us far beyond our limits. But the powerful weapon depicted in Fig.\r\n102 is designed to be worked only by the manual effort of a few men. In\r\nthis mounting the pressure of condensed air sustains the gun in the\r\nfiring position; that pressure, acting upon the water in the recoil\r\npresses, having previously forced up their rams so as to turn into a\r\nnearly vertical position the strong brackets or beams on which the\r\ntrunnions are supported. The recoil is checked in the usual way by the\r\nforcing of the water through small ports or valves as the ram descends,\r\nbut these valves are so arranged that the water is in part forced back\r\ninto the air chamber, and there recompresses the air, to restore the\r\npower for again raising the gun. The pressure in the air chamber when\r\nthe gun is down may be about 1,400 lbs. per square inch; when it is up\r\nthis will be reduced to perhaps one half by the expansion of the air in\r\ndoing work. We have here the reaction of compressed air taking the place\r\nof the gravity of the counterpoise originally designed. There are in\r\nthis hydro-pneumatic mounting a number of adjusting appliances, such as\r\nforcing pumps, brakes, etc., for regulating the pressures, or quantity\r\nof liquid, as, for instance, when lowering the gun without any recoil\r\naction in operation. Then again, with any change in the weight of\r\nprojectile or in the powder charge, there would be a corresponding\r\nchange in the power of the recoil, and therefore the necessity for\r\ncompensatory adjustments, which are made with great readiness. The\r\nnicety with which the parts are adapted to each other in this mounting\r\nmust be obvious, when we observe the magnitude of the mass to be moved\r\nwith the least delay, and brought to rest, quite gently and exactly, in\r\na new position. Details cannot here be given even of the method by which\r\nthe valves in the recoil cylinders are automatically controlled for this\r\npurpose. Means are also supplied for setting the gun, while still in its\r\nprotected position, to the required angle of elevation or depression.\r\nThe adjustment is made by the long rods attached near the breech and set\r\nat their lower ends to the position giving the intended angle to the\r\nraised gun. The varied and powerful strains to which the parts of this\r\nmechanism are subject, and which have had to be calculated and provided\r\nfor, may be inferred from the enormous recoil energy of the gun, which\r\nunder ordinary conditions amounts to no less than 730 foot-tons. The gun\r\nis provided with ordinary, and also with reflecting, sights, so that no\r\none need be exposed to the enemy’s fire. Protective armour above the gun\r\nis not required, as the pit itself being usually on some elevation is\r\nimperceptible to the enemy, and the gun is visible but for a few\r\nseconds, forming a quite inconspicuous object. The pit in which the gun\r\nis mounted is commonly lined with concrete. Italy, England, Norway,\r\nJapan and other countries have appreciated the advantages of the\r\ndisappearing system in providing the most powerful coast defences yet\r\ndevised, and a great many guns have been mounted on this principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 102.—_68–ton Gun on Elswick Hydro-Pneumatic Mounting._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary piece of ordnance is represented in Fig. 103. It is one\r\nof two huge mortars, the idea of which presented itself to Mr. Mallet\r\nduring the Crimean War, the intention being to throw into the Russian\r\nlines spherical shells a yard in diameter, which would, in fact, have\r\nconstituted powerful mines, rendering it impossible for the\r\nfortifications to continue tenable. Mallet’s original design was to\r\nproject these shells from mortars of no less than 40 tons weight. When\r\nit was pointed out that the transport of so heavy a mass would be\r\nimpracticable, the design was changed to admit of the mortar being made\r\nin pieces not exceeding eleven tons in weight, and built up where\r\nrequired. During the most active period in the siege of Sebastopol this\r\nplan was submitted to Lord Palmerston, who at once ordered two of these\r\napparently formidable pieces to be constructed, without waiting for\r\nofficial examinations of the scheme, and the usual reports of\r\nexperts,—promptness in this case being considered of the utmost\r\nimportance. A contract was made with a private firm, who undertook to\r\ndeliver them in ten weeks. But the difficulties attending such\r\nconstructions not being understood at the time, delays arose, the\r\ncontractors failed, and two years elapsed before the mortars were\r\ncompleted. In the meantime peace had been concluded, and the mortars\r\nwere never fired against any hostile works; but experiments were made\r\nwith one of them at Woolwich. The heaviest of the shells it was intended\r\nto project weighed 2,940 lbs., and for this it was proposed to use a\r\ncharge of 80 lbs. of gunpowder. In the experiments the charges first\r\nused were low, but gradually increased: when it was found that after\r\nevery few rounds repairs became necessary in consequence of the weak\r\npoints in the construction, and after the nineteenth round the mortar\r\nwas so much damaged that the trials were definitely discontinued. The\r\nother mortar, though mounted, was never fired, but remains at Woolwich,\r\nan object of some interest to artillerists, especially since there has\r\nbeen some talk of reverting to this very old-fashioned form of ordnance\r\nas a means of attacking ironclads in their most vulnerable direction by\r\nthe so-called vertical fire. In one of the rounds of the Mallet mortar\r\ntried at Woolwich, a shell weighing 2,400 lbs. was thrown by a charge of\r\n70 lbs. of gunpowder a distance of more than a mile and a half, and it\r\nburied itself in the soil to a very great depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 103.—_Mallet’s Mortar_\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor high-elevation firing, howitzers will more probably be the form of\r\nordnance most in use. The range of the howitzer is determined by the\r\nangle at which it is elevated, whereas with the mortar it is chiefly by\r\nvariation of the powder charge that the aim is adjusted. Many of the old\r\nshort 9 in. muzzle-loaders have already been converted into 11 in.\r\nrifled howitzers, and these are likely to prove of great service in\r\ndefending our harbours and channels against war vessels.\r\n\r\nSome account has been given in a preceding article of the great steel\r\nworks of Krupp & Co. at Essen, and the place has been noted as one of\r\nthe greatest gun factories in the world during the second half of our\r\ncentury. The process there practised of casting crucible steel ingots,\r\nand already described, is precisely that used in the first stage of\r\ngun-making. The steel for guns put into the crucibles is a carefully\r\nadjusted mixture of one quality of iron puddled into steel and subjected\r\nto certain treatment; the other portion is made from a different quality\r\nof iron from which all the carbon has been puddled out. The cast ingot\r\nis forged under a great steam hammer, bored, turned, and steel hoops\r\nshrunk upon it, in several layers, and other operations are performed\r\nupon it like those which have already been mentioned. A 14 in. gun is\r\nsaid to require sixteen months for its manufacture, and its cost to be\r\nabout £20,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 104.—_32–pounder Krupp Siege Gun, with Breech-piece open._\r\n]\r\n\r\nArtillerists had long carried on a warm controversy as to the relative\r\nmerits of wrought iron and steel in gun construction, the latter\r\nmaterial being regarded with shyness on account of its want of\r\nuniformity as formerly produced. Krupp however began as early as 1847 to\r\nmake guns of his excellent crucible steel, and through bad report and\r\ngood report confined himself to this material until, it is asserted, by\r\n1878 he had supplied over 17,000 steel guns of all calibres. He began by\r\nmaking a 3–pounder gun, but soon produced pieces of larger size, all of\r\nwhich were bored and turned out of solid masses of metal. At a later\r\nperiod the plan of shrinking on strengthening hoops of steel was\r\nadopted. The Krupp guns have found extensive favour, and many very heavy\r\nones have been made, some indeed of greater weight than the 110–ton\r\nArmstrong; but the excess of weight is due to the mass of metal which\r\nthe Krupp construction of the breech mechanism requires. Thus Krupp’s\r\n120–ton gun has a muzzle energy of but 45,796 foot-tons, while that of\r\nthe Elswick piece is 55,105 foot-tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105.—_The Citadel of Strasburg after the Prussian Bombardment._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe breech arrangement in the Krupp guns consists of a lateral slot into\r\nwhich slides a closing block after the charge has been inserted from the\r\nrear. An obsolete form of this breech piece is seen in Fig. 104, which\r\nrepresents a 32–pounder gun such as was used in sieges by the Prussians\r\nin the Franco-German War. It will be observed here that the slot and\r\nbreech piece are of rectangular form; but this shape, causing the piece\r\nto be weak where most strength was required, was afterwards altered into\r\na D-shaped section, the curved side being of course to the rear. That\r\ndifficulty which baffled the earliest attempts at breech-loading is the\r\nsame that has given much trouble to modern gunmakers. It consists in so\r\nclosing the breech that no escape of the powder gases can take place\r\nthere at the moment of discharge. When we remember that the momentary\r\npressure of the gases in the powder chamber may amount to more than 40\r\ntons on the square inch, we can well understand the enormous velocity\r\nwith which they will rush forth from even the smallest interspace\r\nbetween the base of the gun and the breech block, but we can hardly\r\nrealise without actual inspection the mechanical action they produce in\r\ntheir passage: when once the escape occurs, a channel is cut in the\r\nmetal as if part had been removed by an instrument, and the piece in\r\nthat condition is disabled for further use. Several devices are in use\r\nobtaining perfect closure of the breech, which is technically called\r\n_obturation_ (Latin, _obturare_, to close up). One of these consists in\r\nfitting closely into the circumference of the bore a ring of very\r\nelastic steel, turned up at the edges towards the powder chamber. The\r\ngas pressure forces the edge of this ring still more closely against the\r\ninterior of the powder chamber, much in the same way as the Bramah\r\ncollar acts in the hydraulic press (see Fig. 165). The shaded circle\r\nshown on the breech piece in Fig. 104 is an additional device for\r\nobtaining obturation. The Broadwell ring, as the above-mentioned\r\ncontrivance is called, is not used in English guns, but another plan of\r\nobtaining a gas-joint has been much adopted, in which a squeezable pad\r\nis by compression forced outwards to close up the bore.\r\n\r\nA very long range was claimed for Krupp’s guns at the time of the\r\nFranco-German War, for at the siege of Paris (1870) it was said they\r\ncould hurl projectiles to the distance of five miles, though probably\r\nthere was some exaggeration in this statement. There is no doubt however\r\nthat the Prussians had very effective and powerful artillery, as may be\r\ngathered from Fig. 105, which is taken from a photograph of part of the\r\nfortifications of Strasburg after the bombardment of that fortress. The\r\nexplosive shells used by the Prussians against masses of troops were not\r\nprecisely segment shells of the form already described, but the\r\nprinciple and effect were the same, for the interior was built up of\r\ncircular rings, which broke into many pieces when the shell exploded.\r\n\r\nOut of the very numerous forms in which modern ordnance is constructed,\r\nwe have been able to select but a few examples for illustration and\r\ndescription. These will suffice, it is hoped, to give an idea of the\r\nprogress that the century has witnessed. It would be beyond our scope to\r\ngive details of the ingenious mechanical devices that have come to be\r\napplied to guns: such as the breech-closing arrangements, the various\r\nways in which recoil is controlled and utilized, etc. A good\r\nillustration, had space permitted, of the scientific skill applied to\r\nordnance would be found in the contrivances fitted to certain\r\nprojectiles in order to determine their explosion at the proper moment.\r\nThese are very different from the cap or time fuse that did duty in the\r\nfirst half of the century. We have indeed said little of the projectiles\r\nthemselves beyond mention of the Palliser chilled shot and the obsolete\r\nstudded projectiles. We have not explained how bands of copper, or other\r\nsoft metal, are put round a certain part of the shot or shell, in order\r\nthat, being forced into the grooves, the axial rotation may be imparted,\r\nor how windage is prevented by “gas checks” attached to the base of the\r\nprojectiles. We must now be contented to conclude this section by\r\nshowing the structure of two kinds of explosive shells which have been\r\nmuch used.\r\n\r\nShrapnel shell takes its name from Lieutenant Shrapnel, who was its\r\ninventor about the end of last century, but the projectile began to be\r\nused only in 1808. Fig. 105_a_ is a section showing the shell as a case\r\ncontaining a number of spherical bullets, of which in the larger shells\r\nthere are very many, the interspaces being filled with rosin, poured in\r\nwhen melted; the bullets are thus prevented from moving about. The\r\nfigure shows the shell without the fuse or percussion apparatus, which\r\nscrews into the hollow at the front. The bursting charge of gunpowder is\r\nbehind the bullets, and when it explodes they travel forward with a\r\ngreater velocity than the shell, but with trajectories more or less\r\nradiating, carrying with them wide-spreading destruction and death.\r\n\r\nA shrapnel shell may be said to be a short cannon containing its charge\r\nof powder in a thick chamber at the breech end; the sides of the fore\r\npart of the shell are thinner than those of the chamber, and may be said\r\nto form the barrel of the cannon. This cannon is loaded up to the muzzle\r\nwith round balls, which vary with the shell in size. An iron disc\r\nbetween the powder and the bullets represents the wad used in ordinary\r\nfowling-pieces. A false conical head is attached to the shell, so that\r\nits outward appearance is very similar to that of an ordinary\r\ncylindro-conoidal shell: that is to say, it looks like a very large long\r\nEnfield bullet. The spinning motion which had been communicated to the\r\nshell by the rifling of the gun from which it had been fired causes the\r\nbarrel filled with bullets to point in the direction of the object at\r\nwhich the gun has been aimed. Consequently, when the shrapnel shell is\r\nburst, or rather fired off, the bullets which it contained are streamed\r\nforward with actually greater velocity than that at which the shell had\r\nbeen moving; and the effect produced is similar to firing grape and\r\ncanister from a smooth-bore cannon at a short range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105_a_.—_The Shrapnel and Segment Shells._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSegment shells were first brought into use by Lord Armstrong in 1858 in\r\nconnection with his breech-loading guns. The segment shell consists of a\r\nthin casing like a huge conical-headed thimble, with a false bottom\r\nattached to it. It is filled with small pieces of iron called\r\n“segments,” cast into shapes which enable them to be built up inside the\r\nouter casing into two or more concentric circular walls. The internal\r\nsurface of the inmost wall forms the cavity of the compound or segment\r\nshell, and contains the bursting charge. The segment shell is fitted\r\nwith a percussion fuse, which causes it to explode when it strikes. In\r\nthe shrapnel shell, the powder charge is situated in rear of the\r\nbullets, and consequently produces the chief effect in a forward\r\ndirection. In the segment shell, the powder is contained inside the\r\nsegments, and therefore produces the chief effect in a lateral\r\ndirection. When the shrapnel shell is burst at the right moment, its\r\neffect is greatly superior to that of the segment shell; on the other\r\nhand, the segment shell, when employed at unknown or varying distances,\r\nis far more unlikely to explode at the proper time.\r\n\r\nShrapnel and segment shells can be used with field artillery, _i.e._,\r\n9–pounders, 12–pounders, 16–pounders; and also with heavy rifled guns in\r\nfortresses, viz., 40–pounders, 64–pounders, 7–in. and 9–in. guns. But\r\nthe conditions of their service are very different in each case. With\r\nregard to field artillery, the distance of the enemy is rarely known,\r\nand is constantly changing, and hence the men who have to adjust the\r\nfuses would probably be exposed to the fire of the enemy’s artillery,\r\nand, consequently, could not be expected to prepare the fuses with the\r\ngreat care and nicety which are absolutely necessary to give due effect\r\nto the shells. There are, however, some occasions when the above\r\nobjections would not hold good—as, for instance, when field artillery\r\noccupy a position in which they wait the attack of an enemy advancing\r\nover ground in which the distances are known.\r\n\r\nSegment shells require no adjustment of their percussion fuse. They\r\nenable the artillerymen to hit off the proper range very quickly, since\r\nthe smoke of the shell which bursts on striking tells them at once\r\nwhether they are aiming too high or too low.\r\n\r\nWith regard, however, to the service of heavy rifled guns in fortresses,\r\nthe conditions are quite different. In the first place, the distance of\r\nall objects in sight would be well known beforehand; and in the second\r\nplace, the fuses of the shells would be carefully cut to the required\r\nlength in the bomb-proofs, where the men would be completely sheltered.\r\nThe 7–in. shrapnel contains 227 bullets, and a 9–in. shrapnel would\r\ncontain 500 bullets of the same size, and these shells could be burst\r\nwith extraordinary accuracy upon objects 5,000, 6,000, or 7,000 yards\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _MACHINE GUNS._\r\n\r\nThe name of machine guns has been applied to arms which may be regarded\r\nas in some respects intermediate between cannons and rifles, since in\r\ncertain particulars they partake of the nature of both. Like the former,\r\nthey are fired from a stand or carriage, and in some of their forms\r\nrequire more than one man for their working: in the calibre of their\r\nbarrels and the weight of their projectiles, they are assimilated to the\r\nrifle, but they are capable of pouring forth their missiles in a very\r\nrapid succession—so rapid indeed as practically to constitute volley\r\nfiring. The firing mechanism of the machine gun has always an automatic\r\ncharacter, but the rifle has acquired this feature, so that it cannot be\r\nmade a distinguishing mark: on the other hand, since machine guns have\r\nbeen made to discharge projectiles of such weights as 1 lb. or 3 lb.\r\nthere is nothing to separate them from quick-firing ordnance unless it\r\nbe the automatic firing.\r\n\r\nThe idea of combining a number of musket-barrels into one weapon, so\r\nthat these barrels may be discharged simultaneously or in rapid\r\nsuccession, is not new. Attempts were made two hundred years ago to\r\nconstruct such weapons; but they failed, from the want of good\r\nmechanical adjustments of their parts. Nor would the machine gun have\r\nbecome the effective weapon it is, but for the timely invention of the\r\nrigid metallic-cased cartridge. Several forms of machine guns have in\r\nturn attracted much attention. There is the Mitrailleur (or\r\nMitrailleuse), of which so much was heard at the commencement of the\r\nFranco-German War, and of whose deadly powers the French managed to\r\ncirculate terrible and mysterious reports, while the weapon itself was\r\nkept concealed. Whether this arose from the great expectations really\r\nentertained of the destructive effects of the mitrailleur, or whether\r\nthe reports were circulated merely to inspire the French troops with\r\nconfidence, would be difficult to determine. Our own policy in regard to\r\nnew implements of war is not to attempt to conceal their construction.\r\nExperience has shown that no secret of the least value can long be\r\npreserved within the walls of an arsenal, although the French certainly\r\napparently succeeded in surrounding their invention with mystery for a\r\nwhile. The machine gun, or “battery,” invented by Mr. Gatling, an\r\nAmerican, is said by English artillerists to be free from many defects\r\nof the French mitrailleur. In 1870 a committee of English military men\r\nwas appointed to examine the powers of several forms of mitrailleur,\r\nwith a view to reporting upon the advisability or otherwise of\r\nintroducing this arm into the British service. They recommended for\r\ncertain purposes the Gatling battery gun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105_b_.—_The Gatling Gun.—Rear View._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the Gatling the barrels, ten in number, are distinct and separate,\r\nbeing screwed into a solid revolving piece towards the breech end, and\r\npassing near their muzzles through a plate, by which they are kept\r\nparallel to each other. The whole revolves with a shaft, turning in\r\nbearings placed front and rear in an oblong fixed frame, and carrying\r\ntwo other pieces, which rotate with it. These are the “carrier” and the\r\nlock cylinder. Fig. 105_b_ gives a rear view, and Fig. 105_c_ a side\r\nview, of the Gatling battery gun. The weapon is made of three sizes, the\r\nlargest one firing bullets 1 in. in diameter, weighing ½ lb., the\r\nsmallest discharging bullets of ·45 in. diameter. The small Gatling is\r\nsaid to be effective at a range of more than a mile and a quarter, and\r\ncan discharge 400 bullets or more in one minute. Mr. Gatling thus\r\ndescribes his invention:\r\n\r\n“The gun consists of a series of barrels in combination with a grooved\r\ncarrier and lock cylinder. All these several parts are rigidly secured\r\nupon a main shaft. There are as many grooves in the carrier, and as many\r\nholes in the lock cylinder, as there are barrels. Each barrel is\r\nfurnished with one lock, so that a gun with ten barrels has ten locks.\r\nThe locks work in the holes formed in the lock cylinder on a line with\r\nthe axis of the barrels. The lock cylinder, which contains the lock, is\r\nsurrounded by a casing, which is fastened to a frame, to which trimmers\r\nare attached. There is a partition in the casing, through which there is\r\nan opening, and into which the main shaft, which carries the lock\r\ncylinder, carrier, and barrels, is journaled. The main shaft is also at\r\nits front end journaled in the front part of the frame. In front of the\r\npartition in the casing is placed a cam, provided with spiral surfaces\r\nor inclined planes.\r\n\r\n“This cam is rigidly fastened to the casing, and is used to impart a\r\nreciprocating motion to the locks when the gun is rotated. There is also\r\nin the front part of the casing a cocking ring which surrounds the lock\r\ncylinder, is attached to the casing, and has on its rear surface an\r\ninclined plane with an abrupt shoulder. This ring and its projection are\r\nused for cocking and firing the gun. This ring, the spiral cam, and the\r\nlocks make up the loading and firing mechanism.\r\n\r\n“On the rear end of the main shaft, in rear of the partition in the\r\ncasing, is located a gear-wheel, which works to a pinion on the\r\ncrank-shaft. The rear of the casing is closed by the cascable plate.\r\nThere is hinged to the frame in front of the breech-casing a curved\r\nplate, covering partially the grooved carrier, into which is formed a\r\nhopper or opening, through which the cartridges are fed to the gun from\r\nfeed-cases. The frame which supports the gun is mounted upon the\r\ncarriage used for the transportation of the gun.\r\n\r\n“The operation of the gun is very simple. One man places a feed-case\r\nfilled with cartridges into the hopper; another man turns the crank,\r\nwhich, by the agency of the gearing, revolves the main shaft, carrying\r\nwith it the lock cylinder, carrier, barrels, and locks. As the gun is\r\nrotated, the cartridges, one by one, drop into the grooves of the\r\ncarrier from the feed-cases, and instantly the lock, by its impingement\r\non the spiral cam surfaces, moves forward to load the cartridge, and\r\nwhen the butt-end of the lock gets on the highest projection of the cam,\r\nthe charge is fired, through the agency of the cocking device, which at\r\nthis point liberates the lock, spring, and hammer, and explodes the\r\ncartridge. As soon as the charge is fired, the lock, as the gun is\r\nrevolved, is drawn back by the agency of the spiral surface in the cam\r\nacting on a lug of the lock, bringing with it the shell of the cartridge\r\nafter it has been fired, which is dropped on the ground. Thus, it will\r\nbe seen, when the gun is rotated, the locks in rapid succession move\r\nforward to load and fire, and return to extract the cartridge-shells. In\r\nother words, the whole operation of loading, closing the breech,\r\ndischarging, and expelling the empty cartridge-shells is conducted while\r\nthe barrels are kept in continuous revolving movement. It must be borne\r\nin mind that while the locks revolve with the barrels, they have also,\r\nin their line of travel, a spiral reciprocating movement; that is, each\r\nlock revolves once and moves forward and back at each revolution of the\r\ngun.\r\n\r\n“The gun is so novel in its construction and operation that it is almost\r\nimpossible to describe it minutely without the aid of drawings. Its main\r\nfeatures may be summed up thus: 1st.—Each barrel in the gun is provided\r\nwith its own independent lock or firing mechanism. 2nd.—All the locks\r\nrevolve simultaneously with the barrels, carrier, and inner breech, when\r\nthe gun is in operation. The locks also have, as stated, a reciprocating\r\nmotion when the gun is rotated. The gun cannot be fired when either the\r\nbarrels or locks are at rest.”\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful mechanical principle developed in the gun, viz.,\r\nthat while the gun itself is under uniform constant rotary motion, the\r\nlocks rotate with the barrels and breech, and at the same time have a\r\nlongitudinal reciprocating motion, performing the consecutive operations\r\nof loading, cocking, and firing without any pause whatever in the\r\nseveral and continuous operations.\r\n\r\nThe small Gatling is supplied with another improvement called the “drum\r\nfeed.” This case is divided into sixteen sections, each of which\r\ncontains twenty-five cartridges, and is placed on a vertical axis on the\r\ntop of the gun. As fast as one section is discharged, it rotates, and\r\nbrings another section over the feed aperture, until the whole 400\r\ncharges are expended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105_c_.—_The Gatling Gun.—Front View._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter a careful comparison of the effects of field artillery firing\r\nshrapnel, the committee concluded that the Gatling would be more\r\ndestructive in the open at distances up to 1,200 yards, but that it is\r\nnot comparable to artillery in effect at greater distances, or where the\r\nground is covered by trees, brushwood, earthworks, &c. The mitrailleur,\r\nhowever, would soon be knocked over by artillery if exposed, and\r\ntherefore will probably only be employed in situations under shelter\r\nfrom such fire. An English officer, who witnessed the effects of\r\nmitrailleur fire at the battle of Beaugency, looks upon the mitrailleur\r\nas representing a certain number of infantry, for whom there is not room\r\non the ground, suddenly placed forward at the proper moment at a\r\ndecisive point to bring a crushing fire upon the enemy. Many other\r\neye-witnesses have spoken of the fearfully deadly effect of the\r\nmitrailleur in certain actions during the Franco-German War.\r\n\r\nMr. Gatling contends that, shot for shot, his machine is more accurate\r\nthan infantry, and certainly the absence of nerves will ensure\r\nsteadiness; while so few men (four) are necessary to work the gun that\r\nthe exposure of life is less. No re-sighting and re-laying are necessary\r\nbetween each discharge. When the gun is once sighted its carriage does\r\nnot move, except at the will of the operator; and the gun can be moved\r\nlaterally when firing is going on, so as to sweep the section of a\r\ncircle of 12° or more without moving the trail or changing the wheels of\r\nthe carriage. The smoke of battle, therefore, does not interfere with\r\nits precision.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the part this new weapon is destined to play in the wars\r\nof the future, we know that every European Power has now provided itself\r\nwith some machine guns. The Germans have those they took from the\r\nFrench, who adhere to their old pattern. The Russians have made numbers\r\nof Gatlings, each of which can send out, it is said, 1,000 shots per\r\nminute, and improvements have been effected, so as to obtain a lateral\r\nsweep for the fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105_d_.—_The Montigny Mitrailleur._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA competitor to the Gatling presents itself in the Belgian mitrailleur,\r\nthe Montigny, Fig. 105_d_. This gun, like the Gatling, is made of\r\nseveral different sizes, the smallest containing nineteen barrels and\r\nthe largest thirty-seven. The barrels are all fitted into a wrought iron\r\ntube, which thus constitutes the compound barrel of the weapon. At the\r\nbreech end of this barrel is the movable portion and the mechanism by\r\nwhich it is worked. The movable portion consists mainly of a short\r\nmetallic cylinder of about the same diameter as the compound barrel, and\r\nthis is pierced with a number of holes which correspond exactly with the\r\nposition of the gun-barrels, of which they would form so many\r\nprolongations. In each of the holes or tubes a steel piston works\r\nfreely; and when its front end is made even with the front surface of\r\nthe short cylinder, a spiral spring, which is also contained in each of\r\nthe tubes, is compressed. The short cylinder moves as a whole backwards\r\nand forwards in the direction of the axis of the piece, the movement\r\nbeing given by a lever to the shorter arm of which the movable piece is\r\nattached. When the gun is to be loaded this piece is drawn backwards by\r\nraising the lever, when the spiral springs are relieved from\r\ncompression, and the heads of the pistons press lightly against a flat\r\nsteel plate in front of them. The withdrawal of the breech-block gives\r\nspace for a steel plate, bored with holes corresponding to the barrels,\r\nto be slid down vertically; and this plate holds in each hole a\r\ncartridge, the head of each cartridge being, when the plate has dropped\r\ninto its position, exactly opposite to the barrel, into which it is\r\nthrust, when the movable breech-block is made to advance. The anterior\r\nface of this breech-block is formed of a plate containing a number of\r\nholes again corresponding to the barrels, and in each hole is a little\r\nshort rod of metal, which has in front a projecting point that can be\r\nmade to protrude through a _small_ aperture in the front of the plate,\r\nthe said small apertures exactly agreeing in position with the centres\r\nof the barrels, and being the only perforations in the front of the\r\nplate. The back of the plate has also openings through which the heads\r\nof the pistons can pass, and by hitting the little pieces, or strikers,\r\ncause their points to pass out through the apertures in front of the\r\nplate, and enter the base of the cartridges, where _fulminate_ is\r\nplaced. The plate filled with cartridges has a bevelled edge, and the\r\npoints of the strikers are pushed back by it as it descends. The heads\r\nof the pistons are separated until the moment of discharge from the\r\nrecesses containing the strikers by the flat steel plate or shutter\r\nalready mentioned. The effect, therefore, of pushing the breech-block\r\nforward is to ram the cartridges into the barrels, and at the same time\r\nthe spiral springs are compressed, and the heads of the pistons press\r\nagainst the steel shutter which separates them from the strikers, so\r\nthat the whole of the breech mechanism is thus closed up. When the piece\r\nis to be fired a handle is turned, which draws down the steel shutter\r\nand permits the pistons to leap forward one by one, and hit the\r\nstrikers, so that the points of the latter enter the cartridges and\r\ninflame the fulminate. The shutter is cut at its upper edge into steps,\r\nso that no two adjoining barrels are fired at once. The whole of the\r\nthirty-seven barrels can be fired by one and a quarter turns of the\r\nhandle, which may, of course, be given almost instantly, or, by a slower\r\nmovement, the barrels can be discharged at any required rate.\r\n\r\nThe barrels of the machine guns we have described do not, as is\r\ngenerally supposed, radiate; on the contrary, they are arranged in a\r\nperfectly parallel direction. In consequence of this, the bullets are at\r\nshort ranges directed nearly to one spot. The Gatling gun was adopted as\r\na service weapon by the British navy, and in several minor actions it\r\nhad proved effective, but in its original form it was superseded by the\r\nGardner gun, in which the barrels are fixed horizontally side by side,\r\nand are in number five or fewer; each barrel is able to fire 120 rounds\r\nper minute. A new system of feed was afterwards applied to the Gatling\r\ngun by Mr. Accles, by means of which this gun was greatly improved and\r\nits rate of firing was increased to more than 1,000 rounds per minute;\r\nindeed, 80 rounds have been fired from it within 2 seconds. The Gatlings\r\nin this improved form have ten barrels, and are provided with feed\r\ndrums, each containing 104 cartridges, and capable, when empty, of being\r\nalmost instantly replaced by a full one. The contents of one drum can,\r\nif necessary, be discharged in about 2¼ seconds, so that in this time\r\n104 rifle bullets would be fired; or considerably more than the rate of\r\n1,000 rounds per minute could easily be maintained. The weapon is so\r\nmounted, that without moving its carriage it can be pointed at any angle\r\nof elevation or depression, and through a considerable lateral range.\r\n\r\nMr. Nordenfelt has brought out a machine gun, which, on account of the\r\nsimplicity and strength of its firing mechanism, has proved the most\r\nreliable weapon of its class, and it also has been adopted into the\r\nBritish service, and indeed into that of nearly every nation in the\r\nworld. In this gun there are five barrels arranged as in the Gardner,\r\nbut the firing is operated by a lever working backwards and forwards at\r\nthe rate of 600 rounds per minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105_e_.—_A Hotchkiss Gun._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the firing of all these weapons, by turning a crank, or moving a\r\nlever at one side, any attempt at exact aiming must obviously be\r\ndifficult if not impossible, from the liability of the gun to get moved.\r\nSeveral designs have been proposed for making the firing mechanism\r\nentirely automatic so as to require no effort on the part of the firer,\r\nwhose attention can then be directed solely to pointing the piece. It\r\nwould not be easy to explain in detail the way in which this is\r\naccomplished in these very ingenious guns; for while the principle of\r\ntheir action is sufficiently clear, namely, that the force of the recoil\r\nis made to extract the spent cartridge, open the breech, insert a fresh\r\ncartridge, close the breech, and fire the charge, the mechanism of the\r\nreacting springs, etc., by which this is effected could scarcely, even\r\nby the aid of elaborate diagrams, be made intelligible to any other than\r\na gunsmith. The Maxim is one of those automatic guns: it has but one\r\nbarrel, and after the first discharge it will go on firing with\r\nmarvellous rapidity the cartridges supplied to it in a continuous chain,\r\nand this without any deviation from such direction as may be given to it\r\nby the operator, for he has neither crank to turn nor lever to move, but\r\nmerely sits behind an iron shield directing the weapon at will, which,\r\nwithout interference, fires hundreds of shots per minute from one\r\nbarrel, so long as the long bands of cartridges are supplied to it.\r\n\r\nMr. Nordenfelt and Mr. Hotchkiss have also both contrived quick firing\r\nguns for 1–lb., 3–lb., and 6–lb. projectiles, and these, it has been\r\nthought, will be of great service in naval warfare as against torpedo\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nThough the automatic mechanism, whereby the breech operations are all\r\nperformed by the force of the recoil of the barrel, which is allowed to\r\nslide backwards, and is then returned to its place by a spring, is too\r\ncomplicated for illustration here, mention may be made of a quite recent\r\ndevice by which the recoil action is dispensed with, and the mechanism\r\nso far simplified that scarcely more than half the number of parts in\r\nthe lock mechanism are required. Imagine a closed tube beneath the\r\nbarrel, parallel to it, and communicating with it only by a small boring\r\nnear the muzzle; through this opening the expanding gases will pass, in\r\na degree depending on its size and position, and by their action on a\r\npiston near the breech, impulses are supplied that will actuate the lock\r\nmechanism so long as cartridges are supplied, as they may be in a\r\ncontinuous band. A weapon of this construction has been already tried,\r\nand its discharges are so rapid that the sound of them is described as\r\nbeing quite deafening. This plan appears to be equally applicable to\r\nsmall arms, and to machine or field guns. A very effective gun of the\r\nkind, which fires ordinary rifle bullets, has been contrived by Mr.\r\nHotchkiss, and is represented in Fig. 105_e_. It is capable of sending\r\nforth as many as 1,000 shots in one minute.\r\n\r\nModern ordnance has required certain modifications in the making of\r\ngunpowder, so that the original name of _powder_ would now hardly be\r\napplicable at all. The large charges now used, if introduced in the form\r\nof fine powder, would certainly shatter the guns from the suddenness of\r\nthe exploding force. Hence the material is made up into larger or\r\nsmaller masses, generally rounded like small pebbles. The explosive used\r\nfor the huge 110–ton guns presents itself in the form of\r\nchocolate-coloured hexagonal prisms, two or three inches long and about\r\nan inch in diameter. These are obtained by compressing the specially\r\nprepared material into moulds with a hydraulic press. The reason for\r\nthis process is that, in order to obtain precision and uniformity in the\r\neffects, not only must the composition of the powder be always the same,\r\nbut the size, shape, weight, and number of the several portions that\r\nmake up the charge must be invariable. It has not been found possible to\r\nfire one of these monster guns many times without such signs of\r\ndeterioration as would suggest a short “life” for each of them. But the\r\ngreatest necessity for modern fire-arms is a smokeless powder or other\r\nexplosive. It is obvious that the advantages of quick firing, whether of\r\nlarge or of small fire-arms, are greatly reduced if the soldier or\r\ngunner is prevented by smoke from taking aim. The invention of a\r\nsmokeless gunpowder has several times been announced, and great advances\r\nhave, indeed, been made towards its realization. Certain compositions,\r\nwhich appeared to meet the requirement of being practically smokeless,\r\nhave, however, been found liable to chemical changes, or to corrode the\r\nbore, or to possess other objectionable properties. In this country the\r\nexplosive coming into use as best adapted for quick firing guns, etc.,\r\npresents itself in appearance like whitish or grey strings, and has\r\nhence received the name of _cordite_. The composition and mode of\r\nmanufacture of these new substitutes for gunpowder are not readily\r\ndisclosed, each military authority jealously guarding its own secrets.\r\nThe problem of smokeless powder has, however, been almost completely\r\nsolved, for at a military review that took place on the Continent in\r\n1889, the discharge of the rifles (loaded with blank cartridges, of\r\ncourse) is said to have been attended with no more smoke than the puff\r\nof a cigar. The new invention will cause some changes in military\r\ntactics, for the manœuvres formerly executed under cover of the battle\r\nsmoke will no longer be possible. Some particulars as to the nature of\r\nsmokeless powders will be found in the article on “Explosives.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 106.—_Harvey’s Torpedo. Working the Brakes._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TORPEDOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe notion of destroying ships or other structures by explosions of\r\ngunpowder, contained in vessels made to float on the surface of the\r\nwater, or submerged beneath it, is not of very modern origin. Two\r\nhundred and fifty years ago the English tried “floating petards” at the\r\nsiege of Rochelle. During the American War of Independence similar\r\ncontrivances were used against the British, and from time to time since\r\nthen “torpedoes,” as they were first termed by Fulton, have been\r\nemployed in warfare in various forms; but up to quite a recent period\r\nthe use of torpedoes does not appear to have been attended with any\r\ndecided success, and it is probable that but for the deplorable Civil\r\nWar in the United States we should have heard little of this invention.\r\nDuring that bitter fratricidal struggle, however, when so much ingenuity\r\nwas displayed in the contrivance of subsidiary means of attack and\r\ndefence, the torpedo came prominently into notice, having been employed\r\nby the Confederates with the most marked effects. It is said that\r\nthirty-nine Federal ships were blown up by Confederate torpedoes, and\r\nthe official reports own to twenty-five having been so destroyed. This\r\ncaused the American Government to turn their attention to the torpedo,\r\nand they became so convinced of the importance of this class of war\r\nengine that they built boats expressly for torpedo warfare, and equipped\r\nsix _Monitors_ for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIt has been well remarked that the torpedo plays the same part in naval\r\nwarfare as does the mine in operations by land. This exactly describes\r\nthe purpose of the torpedo where it is used defensively, but the\r\ncomparison fails to suggest its capabilities as a weapon of offence.\r\nThere are few occasions where a mine is made the means of attack, while\r\nthe torpedo readily admits of such an employment, and, used in this way,\r\nit may become a conspicuous feature of future naval engagements. Many\r\nforms of this war engine have been invented, but all may be classified,\r\nin the first place, under two heads: viz., stationary torpedoes, and\r\nmobile or offensive torpedoes; while independent distinctions may be\r\nmade according to the manner of firing the charge; or, again, according\r\nto the mode of determining the instant of the explosion. The stationary\r\ntorpedo may be fixed to a pile or a raft, or attached to a weight; the\r\noffensive torpedo may be either allowed to float or drift against the\r\nhostile ships, or it may be propelled by machinery, or attached to a\r\nspar of an ironclad or other vessel. The charge may be fired by a match,\r\nby percussion, by friction, by electricity, or by some contrivance for\r\nbringing chemicals into contact which act strongly upon each other, and\r\nthus generate sufficient heat to ignite the charge. The instant of\r\nexplosion may be determined by the contact of the torpedo with the\r\nhostile structure (in which case it is said to be “self-acting”), or by\r\nclockwork, or at the will of persons directing the operations. In some\r\ncases lines attached to triggers are employed; in others electric\r\ncurrents are made use of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 107.—_Submerged Torpedo._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the American Civil War the stationary torpedoes at first laid down\r\nwere self-acting, that is, they were so arranged as to explode when\r\ntouched by a passing vessel. Such arrangements present the great\r\ndisadvantages of being as dangerous to friendly as to hostile ships. The\r\noperation of placing them is a perilous one, and when once sunk, they\r\ncan only be removed at great risk. Besides this, they cannot be relied\r\non for certain action in time of need, as the self-acting apparatus is\r\nliable to get out of order. The superiority of the method of firing them\r\nfrom the shore when the proper instant arrived, became so obvious that\r\nthe self-acting torpedo was soon to a great extent superseded by one so\r\narranged that an observer could fire it at will, by means of a\r\ntrigger-line or an electric current. Similar plans had often been\r\npreviously employed or suggested. For example, during the war between\r\nAustria and Italy the Austrian engineers at Venice had very large\r\nelectric torpedoes sunk in the channels which form the approaches to the\r\ncity. They consisted of large wooden cases capable of containing 400\r\nlbs. of gun-cotton, moored by chains to a wooden framework, to which\r\nweights were lashed that sufficed to sink the whole apparatus, Fig. 107.\r\nA cable containing insulated wires connected the torpedo with an\r\nelectrical arrangement on shore, and the explosion could take place only\r\nby the operator sending a current through these wires. The torpedo was\r\nwholly submerged, so that there was nothing visible to distinguish its\r\nposition. There was no need of a buoy or other mark, as in the case of\r\nself-acting torpedoes, to warn friendly vessels off the dangerous spot,\r\nand therefore nothing appeared to excite an enemy’s suspicions. But it\r\nis, however, absolutely necessary that the defenders should know the\r\nprecise position of each of their submarine mines, so that they might\r\nexplode it at the moment the enemy’s ship came within the range of its\r\ndestructive action. This was accomplished at Venice in a highly\r\ningenious manner, by erecting a camera obscura in such a position that a\r\ncomplete picture of the protected channels was projected on a fixed\r\nwhite table. While the torpedoes were being placed in their positions an\r\nobserver was stationed at the table, who marked with a pencil the exact\r\nspot at which each torpedo was sunk into the water. Further, those\r\nengaged in placing the torpedoes caused a small boat to be rowed round\r\nthe spot where the torpedo had been placed, so as to describe a circle\r\nthe radius of which corresponded to the limit of the effective action of\r\nthe torpedo. The course of the boat was traced on the picture in the\r\ncamera, so that a very accurate representation of the positions of the\r\nsubmarine mines in the channels was obtained. Each circle traced on the\r\ntable was marked by a number, and the wire in connection with the\r\ncorresponding torpedo was led into the camera, and marked with the same\r\nnumber, so that the observer stationed in the camera could, when he saw\r\nthe image of an enemy’s ship enter one of the circles, close the\r\nelectric circuit of the corresponding wire, and thus instantly explode\r\nthe proper torpedo. The events of the war did not afford an opportunity\r\nof testing practically the efficiency of these preparations.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of exploding torpedoes from the shore has been devised by\r\nAbel and Maury. It has the advantage of being applicable by night as\r\nwell as by day. The principle will be easily understood with the\r\nassistance of the diagram, Fig. 108, in which, for the sake of\r\nsimplicity, the positions of only three torpedoes, 1, 2, 3, are\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 108.—_Mode of Firing Torpedo._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn this arrangement two observers are required at different stations on\r\nthe shore. At each station—which should not, of course, be in any\r\nconspicuous position—is a telescope, provided with a cross-wire, and\r\ncapable of turning horizontally about an upright axis. The telescope\r\ncarries round with it, over a circular table of non-conducting\r\nsubstance, a metallic pointer which presses against narrow slips of\r\nmetal let into the circumference of the table. To each slip of metal a\r\nwire passing to a torpedo is attached, and another wire is connected\r\nwith the axis of the pointer, so as to be put into electric contact with\r\neach of the others when the pointer touches the corresponding piece of\r\nmetal on the rim of the table. The mode in which these wires are\r\nconnected with the torpedoes, the telescopes, and the electric apparatus\r\nis shown by the lines in the diagram. At each station is a key, which\r\ninterrupts the electric circuit except when it is pressed down by the\r\noperator. There are thus four different points at which contacts must be\r\nsimultaneously made before the circuit can be complete or a torpedo\r\nexplode. In the diagram three of these are represented as closed, and in\r\nsuch a condition of affairs it only remains for the observer to depress\r\nthe handle of the key at station B to effect the explosion of torpedo\r\nNo. 2. The observer at station a is supposed to see the approaching\r\nvessel in the line of torpedo No. 2, and recognizing this as an enemy’s\r\nship, he depresses the key at his station. The operator at B, by\r\nfollowing the course of the vessel with his telescope, will have brought\r\nthe pointer into contact with the wire leading to No. 2 torpedo, and he\r\nthen causes the explosion to take place by completing the circuit by\r\ndepressing his key. A modification of this plan is proposed by which the\r\nposition of the torpedoes is indicated by placing marks, such as\r\ndifferently-coloured flags, or by night lamps with coloured glasses,\r\nthrowing their light only towards the telescopes. These marks are placed\r\nin the line of direction of each torpedo from the telescope as at\r\n_c_{1}_, _c_{2}_, _c_{3}_ and _b_{1}_, _b_{2 3}_; and if they can be put\r\nat some distance, the position of the torpedo is determined with great\r\naccuracy by the intersection of the lines of sight of the two\r\ntelescopes. Electric wires connect the stations and the torpedoes in the\r\nsame manner as we have before described. Such methods of firing\r\ntorpedoes are no doubt the most efficient, for the destructive charge\r\nmay be sunk so far below the surface that not a ripple or an eddy can\r\nexcite an enemy’s suspicion, or the channel appear otherwise than free\r\nand unobstructed, while friendly ships may pass and repass without risk;\r\nfor the current which determines the explosion only passes when the two\r\nsentinels complete the circuit by simultaneously depressing their keys.\r\n\r\nAttempts have often been made to convert the torpedo into an offensive\r\nweapon, by causing vessels containing explosive charges to drift by\r\ncurrents, or otherwise, into contact with the enemy’s ships. The results\r\nhave been always unsatisfactory, as there is great uncertainty of the\r\nmachine coming into contact with its intended mark. Besides, it is easy\r\nto defend vessels against such attacks by placing nets, &c., to\r\nintercept the hostile visitors, especially if the attack is made by day,\r\nand by night the chance that a torpedo drifting at random would strike\r\nits object is very small indeed. One condition essential to the success\r\nof such attacks is that the approach of the insidious antagonist may be\r\nunobserved. Accordingly divers schemes have been projected for\r\npropelling vessels wholly submerged beneath the surface of the water, so\r\nthat they may approach their object unperceived, and exert their\r\ndestructive effect precisely at that part of the vessel where damage is\r\nmost fatal, and where an ironclad vessel is most vulnerable, namely,\r\nbelow the water-line. Vessels have been built, propelled by steam and so\r\ncontrived that their bodies are wholly submerged, only the funnel being\r\nvisible above the surface. These _quasi_ submarine ships carry small\r\ncrews, and are fitted with a long projecting spar in front, at the end\r\nof which is carried the torpedo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 109.—_Explosion of Whitehead’s Torpedo._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 110.—_Effect of the Explosion of Whitehead’s Torpedo._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Federal navy sustained several disasters from torpedo-boats of this\r\nkind. For example, the commander of the United States steamer\r\n_Housatonic_ reported the loss of that vessel by a rebel torpedo off\r\nCharleston on the evening of the 17th February, 1864, stating that about\r\n8·45 p.m. the officer of the deck discovered something in the water\r\nabout 100 yards from, and moving towards, his ship. It had the\r\nappearance of a plank moving in the water. It came directly towards the\r\nship, the time from when it was first seen till it was close alongside\r\nbeing about two minutes; and hardly had it arrived close to the ship\r\nbefore it exploded, and the ship began to sink. The torpedo-boat, with\r\nits commander and crew, were lost, having, it is supposed, gone into the\r\nhole made by the explosion, and sunk with the _Housatonic_. In general,\r\nhowever, the performance of submarine boats has been unsatisfactory.\r\nThere is the difficulty of determining accurately the course of the\r\nboat; there is great danger to the men manning it, as exemplified in the\r\ncase above; and there is again the problem of providing a means of\r\npropulsion which shall enable such a boat to advance or retreat for,\r\nsay, a mile or more, without making its presence conspicuous by smoke or\r\notherwise. The latter condition would appear to exclude the use of steam\r\nfor such purposes, as the inevitable smoke and vapour would betray the\r\npresence of the wily craft. Another power which has been proposed is air\r\nstrongly compressed, and recently a still more portable agent has been\r\nsuggested in solid carbonic acid, which is capable of exerting a\r\npressure of forty atmospheres by passing into the gaseous form. A\r\nlocomotive form of torpedo, invented by Mr. Whitehead, has the explosive\r\ncharge, which consists of about 18 lbs. of glyoxyline, placed in the\r\nfront part of a cigar-shaped vessel, the other part containing mechanism\r\nfor working a screw-propeller, by means of compressed air contained in a\r\nsuitable reservoir. This torpedo having been sunk a few feet below the\r\nwater, the motive power may be set in action by drawing a cord attached\r\nto a detent, when the mechanical fish proceeds in a straight line under\r\nthe water. It is said that this torpedo is effective at 500 yards from\r\nthe ship attacked, and may even be made sufficiently powerful to travel\r\n1,000 yards under the water. The great objection to such arrangements is\r\nthe uncertainty of the missile arriving at its destination, for even\r\nsupposing that the water were without currents, the least deviation from\r\nthe straight course would cause the torpedo to pass wide of the mark at\r\n1,000 yards distant. It is said that at the experimental trials more\r\nthan one projector of such war engines has been startled by his machine,\r\nafter pursuing a circuitous submarine course, exploding in dangerous\r\nproximity to the place whence it was sent off, the engineer narrowly\r\nescaping being “hoist with his own petard.” The experiments which have\r\nbeen made with Whitehead’s torpedo in smooth water appear, however, to\r\nhave been so far successful that we may probably hear of this invention\r\nbeing put in practical operation in certain cases. Fig. 109 shows the\r\nupthrow of water produced by the explosion of one of these torpedoes\r\nagainst an old hulk. The large mass of water thus heaved up is a proof\r\nof the mechanical energy of the explosion, and the effect on the hulk is\r\nshown in Fig. 110, which exhibits the damage done to her timbers, from\r\nthe effects of which, it need hardly be said, she immediately sank. In\r\nFig. 112 we have the representation of the explosion of one of\r\nWhitehead’s torpedoes containing 67 lbs. of gun-cotton, instead of the\r\nglyoxyline. The accurate delineation of these pyramids of water could\r\nnot have been obtained but by the aid of instantaneous photography, and\r\nit constitutes a good example of the great value of such an application\r\nof that art, for the instantaneous photographs obtained in these\r\nexperiments enabled the engineers to calculate accurately the volume and\r\nheight of the column of water, which thus furnishes a measure of the\r\npower of the explosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 111.—_Experiment made by the Royal Engineers with a Torpedo\r\n    charged with 10 lbs. of Gun-Cotton._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary torpedo adopted by the British authorities for coast\r\ndefence consists of a cylinder of boiler plate, 4 ft. long and 3 ft. in\r\ndiameter. It is intended to contain 432 lbs. of loose gun-cotton,\r\nequivalent in explosive energy to about a ton of gunpowder. The effect\r\nof one of these torpedoes exploded 37 ft. beneath the surface of the\r\nwater is depicted in Fig. 113, and in Fig. 114 is shown the effect\r\nproduced when the same charge was exploded at the depth of 27 ft. below\r\nthe surface. Gun-cotton appears to be the most effective explosive for\r\ntorpedoes, if we may judge by the large volume of water heaved up, as\r\nwitness Fig. 111, which shows the result with a small torpedo,\r\ncontaining only 10 lbs. of gun-cotton, exploded at a less depth than\r\nthose already mentioned. The ordinary torpedoes are moored by an anchor\r\nattached to the torpedo, and floating above it is a buoy shaped like an\r\ninverted cone. This cone contains a mechanical arrangement of such a\r\nnature that when it is struck by a passing vessel, an electric circuit\r\nis closed by bringing into contact two wires connecting the torpedo with\r\na voltaic battery on shore. While the apparatus may thus be at any\r\nmoment made fatal to a hostile vessel touching it, from the control it\r\nis under by the engineer having the management of the battery contacts,\r\nfriendly vessels may pass over it with impunity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 112.—_Explosion of Whitehead’s Torpedo, containing 67 lbs. of\r\n    Gun-Cotton._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe employment of torpedoes develops, as a matter of course, a system of\r\ndefence against them. Nets spread across a channel will catch drifting\r\ntorpedoes, and stationary ones may be caused to explode harmlessly by\r\nnets attached to spars pushed a great distance forward from the\r\nadvancing ship.\r\n\r\nBefore the final adoption of Whitehead’s torpedo, presently to be\r\ndescribed, the British Government had, after various official trials,\r\napproved of a towing torpedo designed for offensive operations. It is\r\nthe invention of Commander Harvey, and is worthy of a detailed\r\ndescription for the ingenuity of its construction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 113.—_Explosion of 432 lbs. of Gun-Cotton in 37 feet of Water._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 114.—_Explosion of 432 lbs. of Gun-Cotton in 27 feet of Water._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe shape of Harvey’s torpedo, as may be noticed on reference to Fig.\r\n118, is not symmetrical, but it has some remote resemblance to a boat,\r\nthough constructed with flat surfaces throughout. The outside case is\r\nformed of wood well bound with iron, all the joints being made\r\nthoroughly water-tight. The length is 5 ft. and the depth 1¾ ft., while\r\nthe breadth is only 6 in. Within this wooden case is another water-tight\r\ncase made of thick sheet copper, from the top of which two very short\r\nwide tubes pass upwards to what we may term the deck of the wooden case.\r\nThese are the apertures through which the charge of gunpowder or other\r\nexplosive material is introduced; and when the tubes have been securely\r\nstopped with corks, brass caps are screwed on. The centre of the\r\ninternal case is occupied by a copper tube, _g_, Fig. 115, which passes\r\nthe entire depth, and is soldered to the top and bottom of the copper\r\ncase, so that the interior of the tube has no communication with the\r\nbody of the torpedo, the principal charge merely surrounding it. Thus\r\nthe tube forms a small and quite independent chamber in the midst of the\r\nlarge one, which latter is capable of containing 80 lbs. of gunpowder.\r\nThe copper tube or priming-case contains also a charge, _a_, which when\r\nexploded bursts the tube, and thus fires the torpedo in its centre. The\r\npriming charge is put in from the lower end of the tube, which is\r\nafterwards closed by a cork and brass cap, _h_; for the centre of the\r\npriming-case is occupied by a brass tube, _b_, closed at the bottom, but\r\nhaving within a pointed steel pin projecting upwards. In this tube works\r\nthe exploding bolt _c d_, which requires a pressure of 30 or 40 lbs. to\r\nforce it down upon the steel pin. This pressure is communicated to the\r\nbolt by the straight lever working in the slot at its head, _d_, and\r\nitself acted on at its extremity by the curved lever to which it is\r\nattached. Thus from the mechanical advantage at which the levers act a\r\nmoderate downward pressure suffices to force the exploding bolt to the\r\nbottom of the brass tube. The lower end of this bolt has a cavity\r\ncontaining an exploding composition sufficient in itself to fire the\r\ntorpedo, even independently of the priming charge contained in the\r\ncopper tube. This composition is safely retained in the end of the bolt\r\nby a metallic capsule, _c_, which, when the bolt is forced down, is\r\npierced through by the steel pin at the bottom of the brass tube, and\r\nthen the explosion takes place. The bolts are not liable to explosion by\r\nconcussion or exposure to moderate heat, and they can be kept for an\r\nindefinite period without deterioration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 115.—_Section of Priming-Case and Exploding Bolt._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe mode of producing the explosion is not stated: it consists probably\r\nof an arrangement for bringing chemicals into contact. Besides the two\r\nlevers already mentioned, a shorter curved lever working horizontally\r\nwill be noticed. The object of this is to make a lateral pressure also\r\neffective in forcing down the bolt—a result accomplished by attaching to\r\nthe short arm of the lever a greased cord, which, after passing\r\nhorizontally through a fairleader, runs through an eye (see Fig. 117) in\r\nthe straight lever, and has its extremity fastened so that a horizontal\r\nmovement of the short lever draws the other down. A very important part\r\nof the apparatus is the safety key, _f_, Fig. 115, a wedge which passes\r\nthrough a slot in the exploding bolt, and resting on the brass-work of\r\nthe priming-case, retains the muzzle 1 in. above the pin. Through the\r\neye of the safety key and round the bolts passes a piece of packthread,\r\n_e_, which being knotted is strong enough to keep the key securely in\r\nits place, but weak enough to yield when the strain is put on the line,\r\n_d´_, used for withdrawing the safety key at the proper moment. This\r\nline is attached to the eye of the key, and passes through one of the\r\nhandles forming the termination of the iron straps. As represented in\r\nFig. 117, it forms the centre one of the three coils of rope. The bottom\r\nof the torpedo is ballasted with an iron plate, to which several\r\nthicknesses of sheet lead can be screwed on as occasion requires. Fig.\r\n117 shows the arrangement of the slings by which the torpedo is attached\r\nto the tow-rope, and it will be seen that another rope passes backwards\r\nthrough an eye in the stern to the spindle-shaped object behind the\r\ntorpedo. This is a buoy, of which two at least are always used, although\r\nonly one is represented in the figure. Each buoy, in length 4½ ft., is\r\nmade of solid layers of cork built up on an iron tube running through it\r\nlengthways, so that the buoys admit of being strung upon the rope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 116.—_Harvey’s Torpedo._\r\n]\r\n\r\nHaving thus described the construction of the torpedo, we proceed to\r\nexplain how it is used. It must be understood that if the torpedo and\r\nits attached buoys are left stationary in the water, the tow-rope being\r\nquite slack, the torpedo will, from its own weight, sink several feet\r\nbelow the surface. But when they are _towed_, the strain upon the\r\ntow-line brings the torpedo to the surface, to dip below it again as\r\noften as the tow-line is slackened. There is another peculiarity in the\r\nbehaviour of the torpedo, and that is that, when towed, it does not\r\nfollow in the wake of the vessel, but diverges from the ship’s track to\r\nthe extent of 45°. Its shape and the mode in which it is attached to the\r\ntow-line are designed so as to obtain this divergence. But, according as\r\nthe torpedo is required to diverge to the right or to the left, there\r\nmust be the corresponding shape and arrangement of tow-line and levers;\r\nhence two forms of torpedo are required, the starboard and the port. The\r\nfigures represent the port torpedo, or that which is launched from the\r\nleft side of the torpedo-ship, and diverges to the left of its course.\r\nThe efficiency of the torpedo depends upon the readiness and certainty\r\nwith which it can be brought into contact with the hostile ship, and\r\nthis is accomplished by duly arranging the course of the torpedo vessel,\r\nand by skilfully regulating the tow-line so as to obtain the requisite\r\namount of divergence, and to cause the torpedo to strike at the proper\r\ndepth. The tow-rope is wound on a reel, furnished with a powerful brake,\r\nthe action of which will be readily understood by inspection of Fig.\r\n116, which represents also a similar smaller reel for the line attached\r\nto the safety key. Leather straps, sprinkled with rosin to increase the\r\nfriction, encircle the drums of the reels, and can be made to embrace\r\nthem tightly by means of levers, so that the running out of the lines\r\ncan be checked as quickly as may be desired. Handles are attached to the\r\nstraps, so that they can be lifted off the drum when the line is being\r\ndrawn in by working the handles. When the torpedo is ready for action\r\nand has been launched, a suitable length of tow-line, which is marked\r\nwith knots every ten fathoms, is allowed to run off its reel, while the\r\nsafety key-line is at the same time run off the small reel, care being\r\ntaken to avoid fouling or such strains on the line as would prematurely\r\nwithdraw the key. Fig. 106 will make clear the mode of controlling the\r\nlines, but it is not intended to represent the actual disposition in\r\npractice, where the men and the brakes would be placed under cover. On\r\nthe left of the figure a starboard torpedo is about to be launched; on\r\nthe right a port torpedo has been drawn under the ironclad and is in the\r\nact of exploding, the safety key having been withdrawn by winding in its\r\nline when the torpedo came into proximity to the attacked vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 117.—_Harvey’s Torpedo._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 118.—_Harvey’s Torpedo._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 119.—_Official Trial of “Harvey’s Sea Torpedo,” February, 1870._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the torpedo has been launched over the vessel’s side, the latter\r\nbeing in motion, the torpedo immediately diverges clear of the ship; and\r\nwhen the buoys have also reached the water, the men working the reels\r\npay out the line steadily, occasionally checking the torpedo to keep it\r\nnear the surface, but avoiding a sudden strain upon the slacked\r\ntow-rope, which would cause the torpedo to dive, and in shallow water\r\nthis might lead to the injury or loss of the torpedo. The torpedo can be\r\ngradually veered out to the distance required, at the same time that the\r\nsafety-key is so managed that sufficient strain may be put upon it to\r\nprevent it from forming a long bight astern of the torpedo, but avoiding\r\nsuch a strain as would break the yarn holding the safety-key in its\r\nplace. The distance to which the tow-line may be paid will depend upon\r\nthe circumstances of the attack. More than 50 fathoms is, however, a\r\ndisadvantage, as the long bight of tow-lines makes the torpedo drag\r\nastern. The torpedo can always be made to dive several feet below the\r\nsurface by suddenly letting out two or three fathoms of tow-line. The\r\ntorpedo vessel should, of course, be a steamer of considerable\r\nspeed—able to outstrip when necessary all her antagonists, and, as a\r\nrule, it is found best to make the attack at night. Let us imagine two\r\nships of war at anchor, and parallel to each other at perhaps a distance\r\nof 60 fathoms; and suppose that, under cover of darkness, a hostile\r\ntorpedo vessel boldly steams up between them, having launched both its\r\nstarboard and port torpedoes. In such a case neither ship could fire at\r\nthe torpedo vessel for fear of injuring the other, while the torpedo\r\nvessel would in all probability succeed in bringing its floating mines\r\ninto contact with both its enemies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 120.—_Model of Submarine Guns._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother device for submarine attacks upon vessels on which much\r\ningenuity has been expended is the submarine gun. It has been sought to\r\npropel missiles beneath the surface of the water, these missiles being\r\nusually provided with a charge which, on contact with the vessel’s side,\r\nwould explode, and by making a hole below the water-line, cause the\r\ncertain destruction of the ship. It is obvious that such a mode of\r\nattack would reach the only vulnerable parts of a thickly-plated\r\nironclad, and therefore the project has been recently revived in several\r\nforms. Fig. 120 is taken from the photograph of a model of an invention\r\nof this kind. The guns which are to propel the submarine projectiles,\r\nhave port-holes formed by valves in such a manner that the gun when\r\nloaded can be run out without allowing water to enter; it can then be\r\nfired while the muzzle is below the surface, and again drawn in without\r\nthe port being at any time so opened that water can pour into the\r\nvessel. All contrivances of this kind have hitherto been failures;\r\nindeed, it does not appear possible that they could succeed, except at\r\nvery close quarters, for the resistance offered by water to a body\r\nmoving rapidly in it is extremely great, and, as we have already had\r\noccasion to state, the resistance increases as the square of the\r\nvelocity, and probably in even a higher degree for very great\r\nvelocities. Any one who will remember the effort it requires to move\r\none’s hand quickly backwards and forwards through water will easily\r\nunderstand that the resistance it presents would, in a comparatively\r\nshort space, check the speed of a projectile, however great that speed\r\nmight be at first. A good many years ago Mr. Warner produced a great\r\nsensation by an invention which appears to have been essentially a\r\nfloating torpedo. The cut below, Fig. 121, represents the result of an\r\nexperiment publicly made by him off Brighton, in 1844, upon a barque,\r\nwhich was towed out by a steamer to a distance of a mile and a half from\r\nthe shore. Mr. Warner was on board the steamer, and the barque was 300\r\nyards astern. Five minutes after a signal had been made from the shore,\r\nthe torpedo was caused to explode, striking the barque amidships,\r\nthrowing up a large column of water and _débris_, shooting the mainmast\r\nclean out of the vessel, the mizen going by the board, and dividing the\r\nhull into two parts, so that she sank immediately. Yet this invention,\r\nthough apparently so successful, does not seem to have ever been put in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 121.—_The Warner Experiment off Brighton._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe stationary torpedoes of the kind mostly used in the American Civil\r\nWar were, as already stated, _self-acting_; that is, they exploded when\r\ntouched by a passing vessel. They would now be more generally called\r\n_self-acting mines_, and are to be distinguished from that form of the\r\nweapon in which the explosion is determined by some manipulation on\r\nshore, such as the closing of an electric circuit, when the hostile\r\nvessel comes within the area of destructive action. This form receives\r\nthe name of _observation mines_. Stationary mines are essentially\r\ninstruments of defence, and as such are employed for the protection of\r\nrivers and harbours. The self-acting varieties usually contain a charge\r\nof 70 lbs. to 80 lbs. of gun-cotton, and are commonly arranged in lines.\r\nOf course, when the occasion for which such mines have been laid down is\r\npast, they must be removed, and the operation of picking them up is one\r\nof great danger. The observation mines, on the other hand, do not\r\nrequire immediate removal, and they can be taken up with little risk. In\r\nthe British service the observation mine contains about 500 lbs. of\r\ngun-cotton, and a line of these is sometimes moored in a water-way, from\r\n35 feet to 50 feet below the surface. The area of destructive action in\r\nthis case is a circle of about 30 feet radius, and therefore a line of\r\nseven such mines laid across a channel at intervals of 120 feet apart\r\nwould ensure the almost certain destruction of any war vessel of\r\nordinary breadth that might attempt to pass up a river of 840 feet in\r\nwidth. This is about the distance across the Thames near the Tower of\r\nLondon, but the depth of the river there being only 12 feet at low-water\r\nand 33 feet at high-water, would not suffice to give effect to the full\r\nenergy of so large a charge of gun-cotton; for it has been found that,\r\nfor a given charge, there is a certain depth under water at which its\r\nexplosion will produce the maximum effect, and this depth will be\r\ngreater with heavier charges than with light ones. The regulation\r\n“observation mine” of the British service has a cylindrical case of\r\nstout plate-iron, 32 inches in diameter and 34 inches high, with domed\r\nends. Within this gun-cotton is contained, in a wet condition, in a\r\nnumber of copper envelopes, which have holes for access of water to wet\r\nthe charge from time to time as occasion requires, the wet condition\r\nbeing the safest for the carriage of gun-cotton. The centre of the case\r\nis a tin charged with some discs of dry gun-cotton, and the detonator\r\nrequired to bring about the explosion of the whole charge when the\r\nelectrical contact is made, fires the fuze contained within the primer.\r\nThese cases are arranged to have a certain buoyancy, and are moored with\r\nwire ropes to heavy iron sinkers, the mooring ropes being of such length\r\nas to keep the explosive case at the proper depth below the surface, and\r\nof sufficient strength to resist the force of the currents in the\r\nwaterway. There is also another type of submarine mine, operated by an\r\nelectric current, the circuit of which is closed by contact of a passing\r\nvessel, if at the time a battery on shore is included in the circuit. In\r\nthis way the mines can be made harmless or dangerous for passing vessels\r\nat the will of the operator on shore. The passing vessel is made to\r\ncomplete the circuit by tilting over the cylindrical case so far that\r\nsome mercury contained in a small part of it is upset, and makes the\r\nrequisite metallic contact. This arrangement is known as the\r\n_electro-contact_ mine.\r\n\r\nIn former pages of this article on torpedoes will be found\r\nrepresentations of the effects produced by _Whitehead’s torpedo_, which,\r\nbeing automobile and travelling altogether under the surface of the\r\nwater, was capable of being made a very formidable weapon of offence.\r\nWhen the earlier editions of this work were going through the press, it\r\nwas understood that the Whitehead torpedo left much to be desired as\r\nregards speed, certainty of direction through the water, and perhaps in\r\nother points, the inventor being constantly engaged in effecting\r\nimprovements. At that time particular pains were taken to keep secret\r\nthe nature of the most important parts of the internal mechanism. The\r\nwork of construction was carried on in a room with locked doors,\r\nblocked-out windows, and a military guard outside. The earlier\r\nexperimental forms of this automobile torpedo were constructed in\r\ncomplete secrecy by the inventor himself, with the help of only one\r\ntrusted, skilled mechanic and a boy, who was no other than Mr.\r\nWhitehead’s own son. The history of the invention is very interesting,\r\nand exemplifies the power of skill and perseverance to overcome a\r\nmultitude of difficulties, the result being a machine which is simply a\r\nmarvel of ingenuity and of delicate nicety of adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe first notion of the automobile torpedo appears to have occurred to\r\nan Austrian naval officer; but it took rather the form of a small vessel\r\ncontaining within itself some propelling power by which it could move\r\nalong the surface of the water, its course being directed by ropes or\r\nguiding lines from the shore or from a ship. The fore part of the little\r\nvessel was to hold an explosive, to be fired automatically by the\r\nself-propelled torpedo coming into contact with the side of the hostile\r\nvessel. The propelling power, as first suggested, was clockwork, if that\r\ncould be made efficient, or steam as an alternative. The Austrian\r\nauthorities, however, considered that it would be impracticable to\r\ndirect the course of the torpedo in the manner proposed, and that there\r\nwere also great objections to each of the methods of obtaining motive\r\npower. The assistance of a thoroughly competent and skilful mechanician\r\nwas then sought, and Mr. Whitehead, at that time the director of an\r\nengineering establishment at Fiume, devoted himself to solving the\r\nproblem of devising a torpedo which should be able to travel beneath the\r\nsurface of the water, and, when once started, should require no external\r\nguidance to keep it on its proper course. After some years of\r\nexperimental labours, Mr. Whitehead produced the first form of the\r\nweapon with which his name is associated, but to this he has since added\r\nfrom time to time many ingenious improvements. A committee of experts\r\nhaving been appointed by the Austrian Government to test the\r\ncapabilities of the new invention, it was made the subject of a long\r\nseries of trials, after which the committee recommended its immediate\r\nadoption in the Austrian navy. The earlier form of the Whitehead torpedo\r\nhad, however, the defect already mentioned, of being sometimes very\r\nerratic in its course; its speed was small (6 knots) compared with that\r\nof the more recent patterns (30 knots), and its range of travel\r\nproportionately less. The British Admiralty having invited Mr. Whitehead\r\nto visit England with some specimens of his invention, a committee was\r\nappointed to make complete trials of the capabilities of two weapons he\r\nhad brought with him. Although by this time great improvements had been\r\nmade on the original design, and in particular, Mr. Whitehead had almost\r\ncompletely overcome the difficulty of keeping the torpedo at a uniform\r\ndepth during its course, by means of delicate adjustments in what we may\r\ncall the steering chamber (to be presently mentioned), much remained to\r\nbe accomplished before the weapon attained the perfection of the modern\r\npatterns. Indeed, the inventor may be said to have from time to time\r\nredesigned his contrivances, as when in 1876 the speed was increased to\r\n18 knots, and again in 1884 more powerful engines brought up the speed\r\nto 24 knots. Further improvements have been made by Mr. Whitehead, who\r\ndesigned a new form of the weapon in 1889, and some of the more recent\r\npatterns can now show a speed of 30 knots or more. The committee\r\nappointed by the Admiralty to conduct experiments with the first pair of\r\ntorpedoes brought to England, after having tested them in various ways\r\nfor a period extending over six months, reported that they believed that\r\n“any maritime nation failing to provide itself with submarine locomotive\r\ntorpedoes, would be neglecting a great source of power, both for offence\r\nand defence.” Upon this recommendation the Admiralty immediately\r\npurchased from Mr. Whitehead for £15,000 the secret of the internal\r\nmechanism of his invention and the rights of manufacturing it. The\r\nself-adjusting apparatus within the steering chamber, by means of which\r\nthe torpedo was kept at its due depth, was then a jealously-guarded\r\nsecret; but when the arrangement with Mr. Whitehead was effected, the\r\nGovernment immediately set about the manufacture of these torpedoes on a\r\nlarge scale. The artificers employed in making the Whitehead torpedoes\r\nwere now numerous, and the internal structure of these weapons could not\r\nadvantageously be altogether concealed from those who had to handle them\r\non board of the ships, so that it inevitably happened that some details\r\nof their construction leaked out, and came into the possession of other\r\npowers, whereupon all the maritime states followed the example of Great\r\nBritain by providing their navies with Whitehead or some such form of\r\nlocomotive torpedo. It is no part of our plan to enter into the\r\nmechanical _minutiæ_ of the Whitehead torpedo. We may, however, give the\r\nreader such an idea of the external appearance and internal arrangement\r\nof the Whitehead torpedo as will enable him to appreciate to some extent\r\nthe ingenuity and skill that have been brought to bear upon its\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThere are in existence many different patterns of the\r\nweapon—twenty-four, it is said—and this is what might be expected from\r\nthe fact of its being produced at several different manufactories, each\r\nstriving to effect whatever improvements its resources will supply. Some\r\ntorpedoes have been made at Fiume, very many at Mr. Whitehead’s works at\r\nPortland, as also at the Government establishment at Woolwich, while\r\nprivate enterprise in this direction is encouraged by contracts with\r\nsome private firms, such as that of Messrs. Greenwood & Bately at Leeds.\r\nThe greatest diameter of the large torpedo is 18 inches, but in some it\r\nis rather more, in others 14 inches or 16 inches; and the length may\r\nvary between 14 feet and 19 feet. Many of our Whitehead torpedoes are\r\nmade of polished steel, but in the later patterns phosphor-bronze is\r\npartly made use of, as being not liable to corrode. The interior of the\r\ntorpedo is divided by transverse partitions into five distinct\r\ncompartments. The foremost of these, called the “head,” contains the\r\nexplosive charge when the weapon is ready for use in actual warfare.\r\nThis section, which may occupy about one-sixth of the total length, is\r\nan air-tight case made of phosphor-bronze, one-sixteenth of an inch\r\nthick, and it is kept permanently charged with slabs of wet gun-cotton,\r\nwhich may amount to 200 pounds weight in all, and is ready to be\r\nattached by a screw and bayonet joint to the body of the torpedo; but\r\nthis is done only at the time immediately before it is required for its\r\ndestructive employment. Its place at other times, as when the torpedo is\r\nused for drill practice, and to test its running powers, is occupied by\r\na dummy head of steel, of exactly the same shape and size, and packed\r\nwith wood in such a manner that its weight and centre of gravity are\r\nlike those of the explosive head when the latter is ready for action.\r\nThe wet gun-cotton requires a _detonative_ explosive of dry material\r\nclose to it, in order to determine its own detonation. The explosive\r\nheads of the Whitehead are not fitted with the pistol and priming tube\r\nuntil all is ready for the discharge of the weapon, as this would render\r\nthe handling of the torpedo highly dangerous. This priming apparatus is\r\nmerely a metallic tube that slips into a corresponding hollow in the\r\nexplosive head so far as to reach well within the wet gun-cotton charge,\r\nalthough still separated from the latter by a metal casing. The\r\nposterior extremity of the priming tube contains a few ounces of dry\r\ngun-cotton, and just in front of this is a copper cap containing some\r\nfulminate of mercury, which readily explodes when struck by the point of\r\na steel rod, occupying the centre of the tube and projecting a short\r\ndistance out at the “nose” of the torpedo, so as to be driven inwards by\r\nthe impact of the latter on a ship’s side. The explosion of the\r\nfulminate causes the detonation of the dry gun-cotton at the bottom of\r\nthe priming tube, and this is taken up by the whole mass of the\r\nexplosive with destructive effect. The danger of premature or accidental\r\nexplosion by anything coming in contact with the projecting striker is\r\nobviated by several checks which prevent any chance blow driving the rod\r\nhome against the fulminate charge. The anterior projecting end of the\r\nrod has a screw thread worked upon it, and on this turns freely a nut\r\nprovided with wings like a small fan, revolving in such a manner that as\r\nthe torpedo is moved through the water, the nut is spun off, and the\r\nstriker is free to be driven back, except in so far as it is still\r\nretained by a small copper pin, the breaking of which requires a\r\nconsiderable blow. Again, the little fan above mentioned cannot begin to\r\nspin off the rod until another pin or wedge has been withdrawn, which\r\noperation is performed just before launching the weapon.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the exploding head of the torpedo is the air-chamber,\r\nwhich occupies a considerable space in the length, _i.e._, about\r\none-third of the whole. This part is made of the toughest steel, nearly\r\n⅓ of an inch thick, and contains the power actuating the motor, in the\r\nform of air forced into it by powerful pumps on board the ship, until\r\nthe pressure reaches the enormous amount of 1,300 lbs. or more on the\r\nsquare inch, or, at least, this is what is made use of in the newer\r\npatterns when charged for action. In the largest size of the weapon the\r\nweight of air injected may be more than 60 lbs., and, of course,\r\nconsiderably detracts from the buoyancy of this part.\r\n\r\nBehind the air-chamber comes another much shorter compartment we have\r\ncalled the “steering chamber,” in which are contained the most ingenious\r\nand delicate parts of the apparatus, namely, the mechanism by which this\r\nextraordinary artificial fish adjusts itself, after the manner of a\r\nliving thing, to the required conditions. Among other contrivances, it\r\ncontains several valves controlling the action of the compressed air on\r\nthe engines, etc. The enormous pressure to which the air-chamber is\r\ncharged, if allowed to act unchecked, would give at first a power almost\r\nsufficient to shatter the machinery, and, in order to prevent this, a\r\n“reducing valve” is interposed so that only a moderate and uniform\r\npressure of air is allowed to act upon the engines. Then there is the\r\n“starting valve” by which the air is admitted or cut off from the\r\nengines, and still another valve which is contrived to delay the action\r\nof the compressed air for the short interval during which the torpedo is\r\npassing from the discharging tube until it enters the water. For during\r\nthis interval the propellers not having to act against the water, but\r\nonly against the resistance of the atmosphere, would be whirled round at\r\nan enormous speed, and the machinery would sustain such shocks and\r\nstrains as might endanger the whole apparatus. It is to prevent this\r\nthat the “delay action valve” is provided.\r\n\r\nThe automatic apparatus by which the torpedo’s course is regulated is a\r\nvery remarkable part of the invention, and it admits of the nicest\r\nadjustments. This was the crown of Mr. Whitehead’s ingenuity, but the\r\ndetails were, by an arrangement between the government and the inventor,\r\nnot to be made public, though necessarily communicated to certain\r\nofficers in the service, and known to the chief artisans employed in\r\ntheir fabrication. These persons are all, we believe, required to give\r\npledges not to divulge the arrangement of particular parts. But such\r\ndetails could scarcely be made intelligible, even should they be\r\ninteresting, to the general reader. The principles upon which the\r\ncontrolling apparatus are arranged may, however, be comprehended without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThe tail of the torpedo is provided with two rudders, one in its central\r\nvertical plane, and the other in its central horizontal plane. Their\r\naction in directing the torpedo’s course is exactly that which the tail\r\nsupplies to a fish, or the rudder to a boat. Suppose that while the\r\ntorpedo is passing through the water the vertical rudder is by any means\r\nturned towards one side, the course of the metallic fish will be\r\ndiverted towards that side; or again, a turning upwards of the\r\nhorizontal rudder would have the effect of directing the nose towards\r\nthe surface, and would make the torpedo rise, and so on. Now the\r\npositions of the horizontal rudder are regulated from the “steering\r\nchamber,” in which a heavy weight is suspended like a pendulum, so as to\r\nbe capable of swinging fore and aft. This pendulous weight actuates the\r\nhorizontal rudder through a system of rods and levers, so that when it\r\nhangs vertically the horizontal rudder is level, but if from any cause\r\nthe nose of the torpedo were directed downwards, the pendulous weight\r\nwould come to a more forward position in the steering chamber, and would\r\nraise the rudder, and thus turn the nose towards the surface until the\r\noriginal horizontal position were regained. In the contrary case, of\r\ncourse, the reverse action would take place. But the torpedo, while\r\npreserving a horizontal position, might tend to sink to too great a\r\ndepth, or rise too near the surface, and this is prevented by another\r\nadjustment, namely, a piston receiving the pressure of the water, which,\r\non the other side, is opposed by a spring. If the torpedo sinks a little\r\nthe pressure increases, the piston, which moves with perfect freedom\r\nwithout allowing water to pass in, is forced inwards, and its movement\r\nis communicated to the same levers that connect the pendulous weight\r\nwith the horizontal rudder, the latter is raised, and then the nose of\r\nthe torpedo is directed upwards, and it consequently approaches the\r\nsurface again. In the contrary case the spring, relieved from some of\r\nthe external pressure, operates the levers in the other direction.\r\n\r\nThe compartment immediately behind the “steering chamber” contains the\r\nengines which are of the Brotherhood type, provided with _three_ single\r\nacting cylinders. The three-fold throw prevents any possibility of the\r\nengine getting on a “dead point.” Though this compartment is the\r\nshortest in the torpedo, the engines in the larger sizes are capable of\r\nindicating as much as thirty horse power. It has for simplicity been\r\nstated above that the pendulous weight and the balanced piston act by\r\nmeans of rods on the horizontal rudder; this was so in the early\r\npatterns of the torpedo, but it was soon found that they did not do so\r\nwith sufficient steadiness and promptitude, and the force they could\r\napply was in the larger and swifter forms quite ineffective. Nowadays\r\nthe engine compartment always contains a little piece of apparatus which\r\nis an arrangement of cylinder and piston, upon which the compressed air\r\nacts in one or the other direction according to the way its slide-valve\r\nis moved. It is this slide-valve that the rods from the “steering\r\nchamber” move, and allow the force of the compressed air to turn the\r\nrudder up or down. This auxiliary apparatus has the same relation to the\r\ntorpedo rudder that the steam-steering apparatus of a large vessel has\r\nto its rudder. Although it is only about a few inches long, its power\r\nand delicacy are such that the pressure of half an ounce on its slide\r\nadmits to its piston a force equal to 160 lbs., and its introduction has\r\ngiven the torpedo the power of steadily steering itself.\r\n\r\nBehind the engine compartment, but completely shut off from it, is\r\nanother almost empty division occupying a considerable part of the\r\nlength of the torpedo, and known as the “buoyancy chamber.” But it\r\ncontains, attached to the bottom of it, a certain amount of ballasting,\r\nso adjusted to balance the weights of the other parts that the whole\r\nfloats horizontally, and at the same time preserving the tube in one\r\nvertical position as regards its transverse diameter, _i.e._, so that\r\nthe horizontal rudder is always horizontal. The shaft from the engine\r\npasses through this compartment, as also the rod from the small motor\r\nthat moves the horizontal rudder. These, of course, pass through\r\nwater-tight bearings.\r\n\r\nAt the tail of the torpedo, behind the rudders, are _two_ three-bladed\r\nscrew propellers, of which the anterior one is mounted on a tubular\r\nshaft having a common axis with the other, but made to revolve in the\r\nopposite direction by means of a bevel wheel mounted on each independent\r\nshaft, with a third such wheel connecting them. The object of the double\r\nscrew is to obviate “slip,” that is, ineffective motion of the blades\r\nthrough the water, and by this means the full power of the engines can\r\nbe developed; while any tendency to _deviation_ to right or left, due to\r\nthe rotation, is reduced to a minimum. We have spoken of one horizontal\r\nand one vertical rudder, although externally there appear to be two of\r\neach kind, right and left, above and below, on the tail of the torpedo.\r\nThese pairs, however, are so connected as to be always in the same\r\nrespective planes. The controlling mechanism acting in two different\r\nways on the horizontal rudder has been already indicated, but nothing\r\nhas yet been said about the vertical rudder. It is not moveable by\r\nanything within the torpedo, but is commonly fixed by clamping screws in\r\nor about the same vertical plane as the axis of the torpedo, and it\r\nperforms the same function as a kind of back fin, which, in the earlier\r\nforms, extended nearly the whole length of the tube; and that is\r\nobviating any tendency of the torpedo to roll about its axis. The\r\nvertical rudder can also be fixed at a considerable inclination to the\r\naxis should occasion require, and the effect of that would be to cause\r\nthe torpedo to pursue a circular course of greater or less radius,\r\naccording to the less or greater degree of inclination. Very rarely,\r\nhowever, would this be required, and the vertical rudder may be\r\nconsidered as fixed in the axial plane, or having such slight\r\ninclination as may, on trial, have been found necessary to counteract\r\nany tendency to lateral deviation.\r\n\r\nThere are several different methods for discharging the Whitehead\r\ntorpedoes from ships. They may be sent from a tube below the water-line,\r\nbut the arrangements for that purpose are complicated and difficult to\r\nmanage, while, on the other hand, the launch of the weapon is not\r\nperceived by the enemy, and it is at the same time out of the reach of\r\nany blow from a hostile missile while yet in its discharging tube. More\r\ncommonly the discharging tube is arranged above the water-level. On\r\nregular torpedo boats, the tubes are sometimes mounted on pairs upon a\r\nrevolving table, provided with many nice adjustments, and even the\r\nsingle above-water torpedo tube, as used between decks, is an apparatus\r\nhaving somewhat complicated appliances. The torpedo is expelled from the\r\ntube now preferably by a small charge of _cordite_. But in the Royal\r\nNavy no fewer than some twenty different patterns of torpedo tubes have\r\nbeen in use for the various sizes of torpedoes. In some of these,\r\ncompressed air, in others gunpowder or _cordite_, in others, again,\r\nmechanical impulse propels the torpedo into its element. It would\r\nobviously be impossible within our limits to enter into details of these\r\nvarious constructions, or to attempt descriptions of _all_ the ingenious\r\ncontrivances applied to the torpedo itself, or to give an account of the\r\nmeans of defence against mines and torpedoes, this last being a matter\r\nbelonging to naval tactics. The adoption of the torpedo as a naval\r\nweapon has given rise to special types of boats adapted for its\r\nemployment, and these again have required other boats to destroy them\r\n(“torpedo-boat destroyers” or “catchers”). Light draught and high speed\r\nwere desired in these last; but in many cases the intended speed was\r\ninferior to that of the torpedo boats that were to be caught.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars about the British torpedo-boat destroyer\r\n_Daring_ may be compared with those given of the cruiser _Majestic_. The\r\n_Daring_ is 185 feet long, 7 broad, and she draws only 7 feet of water.\r\nHer speed is about 28½ knots per hour, with a steam pressure in the\r\nboilers of 200 lbs. per square inch, and an air pressure in the\r\nstoke-holds equivalent to 3 inches of water (forced draught.)\r\n\r\nThe importance attached to the prospective use in war of the automobile\r\ntorpedo may be shown by the fact that at the end of 1890 the number of\r\ntorpedo boats built or laid down for England was 206, and for France\r\n210, while other nations followed with numbers proportionate to their\r\nmeans. Forty “torpedo-boat destroyers” were in building for the British\r\nNavy towards the close of the year 1896, and now (March, 1897) it is\r\nannounced that the number of torpedo boats and torpedo-boat destroyers\r\nin the French Navy is to be increased by 175.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 122.—_M. Ferdinand de Lesseps._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SHIP CANALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtificial canals are amongst the oldest of inventions, for, centuries\r\nago, they have been constructed, even of very large dimensions, in\r\nvarious parts of the world. There is in China, for instance, a great\r\ncanal, 900 miles in length and 200 feet broad, which is supposed to have\r\nbeen made 800 years ago. The advantages of canals did not escape the\r\nattention of the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. We read of very early\r\nattempts to cut through isthmuses, in order to form a water\r\ncommunication between regions where other carriage would be long and\r\ndifficult. It appears to be admitted that canals connecting the Red Sea\r\nwith the Mediterranean existed some centuries before the Christian era,\r\nand to cut the Isthmus of Corinth by a waterway was a cherished project\r\nwith several Roman Emperors, and now it appears that in this nineteenth\r\ncentury this project will shortly be realized. But as the canal-lock is\r\nbut a comparatively modern invention, dating only from the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and first used in Holland, all the canals anterior to that\r\nperiod had to be designed as level cuts, a restriction which greatly\r\nincreased the difficulties of the problem. Canals were in use in various\r\nparts of Europe, particularly in Holland and France, long before any\r\nwere constructed in England, as, for example, the Languedoc Canal,\r\nwhich, by a cut of 150 miles, connects the Bay of Biscay with the\r\nMediterranean. It is 60 feet broad, and attains, at its highest level,\r\nan elevation of 600 feet above the sea. The canal system in England was\r\nfirst introduced in the middle of the eighteenth century, and soon\r\nafterwards, the Duke of Bridgewater engaged the famous Brindley to\r\nconstruct a canal, connecting his collieries at Worsley with Manchester,\r\nabout seven miles distant, and afterwards extended his scheme, so as to\r\nopen up a more direct water communication between Manchester and\r\nLiverpool. Before the making of this canal, the cost of the carriage of\r\ngoods between these towns had been forty shillings per ton by land, and\r\ntwelve shillings by water. After that, they were conveyed with\r\nregularity for six shillings per ton. The system was soon extended, so\r\nas to connect the Trent with the Mersey, and the boldness of both the\r\nprojectors and their engineer in carrying out this scheme is memorable\r\nin the history of such undertakings. Brindley was equal to the task of\r\ncoping with the difficulty of carrying his canal over what had hitherto\r\nbeen supposed an insuperable obstacle, for he pierced Harecastle Hill\r\nwith a tunnel more than a mile and a half in length—a then unheard of\r\npiece of engineering—to say nothing of several shorter tunnels, many\r\naqueducts, and scores of locks. The Duke of Bridgewater, who at one\r\nperiod had been unable to raise £500 on his own bond for the prosecution\r\nof his scheme, died in 1803, in receipt of a princely income from the\r\nprofits of his useful undertaking. For its creation, he had, however,\r\ndenied himself the present enjoyments of his patrimonial revenue, by\r\nreducing his expenses at one period to the modest sum of £400 per annum.\r\nBefore his death, the Duke, for taxation purposes, estimated his income\r\nat £110,000 per annum. Before the railway system was fully established a\r\nnetwork of canals had united the most populous places in England, the\r\ntotal length of the waterways being not much less than two thousand\r\nmiles. With the rise of railways the importance of canals as channels\r\nfor the conveyance of merchandise declined. But, nevertheless, in\r\nconsequence of the continued increase of traffic and the great cheapness\r\nwith which goods can be carried by water, canals are often able to\r\ncompete with railways in the carriage of bulky or heavy goods when speed\r\nof transit is not an object. The English canals have, therefore, never\r\nbeen disused or abandoned, notwithstanding the ubiquitous ramifications\r\nof the railway lines. Nay, the value of the Bridgewater Canal system,\r\nabout to be superseded so far as concerns the communication between\r\nLiverpool and Manchester by the greater scheme we have presently to\r\ndescribe, is such that £1,710,000 is now required for its purchase; and\r\nthat is the value in spite of four lines of railway connecting those\r\ngreat towns, and all competing for the carriage of goods. In these\r\ncanals, designed for inland communication only, the navigation is\r\nconfined to boats or barges of very insignificant dimensions compared\r\nwith the sea-going ships that some great modern canals are constructed\r\nto receive.\r\n\r\nTo the present century belongs the famous “Caledonian Canal,” as the\r\nwaterway is often called that extends in a straight line for more than\r\n60 miles across Scotland, in north-east and south-west directions. The\r\ncanal work here was commenced in 1802, under the direction of Telford,\r\nand though it was opened for traffic in 1822, the work as it now exists\r\nwas not completed until 1847. But the length of the actual canal\r\nconstruction in this case did not much exceed 23 miles, for a natural\r\nwaterway, navigable for ships of any burden, is formed by the series of\r\nnarrow lakes that fill what is called the “Great Glen of the Highlands.”\r\nThis glen has many of the characteristics of a great artificial ditch:\r\nits highest point is only 90 feet above the tide level in Loch Linnhe; a\r\ncircumstance not a little remarkable in so mountainous a country. What\r\nis also remarkable is the great depth of these lakes, which in some\r\nplaces exceeds 900 feet. The banks also are generally very steep, and\r\nindeed at one time it was impracticable to pass along the shores of Loch\r\nNess, the longest of the lakes. But there are now good roads along both\r\nbanks. Although the ground traversed by the artificial channels of the\r\nCaledonian Canal is chiefly alluvial, the cost of the undertaking proved\r\nto be great, amounting, it is said, to about one and a quarter million\r\npounds sterling. Indeed, had it not been for the introduction of steam\r\nnavigation before the completion of the work, and the consequent\r\nincrease and facility of water conveyance, it is doubtful whether the\r\nutility of this canal would have been commensurate with its cost, or its\r\nreceipts have made any profit for its promoters. By the Caledonian Canal\r\nlarge steamers and other vessels may pass from sea to sea, and in the\r\nsummer time the steamers that traverse it are crowded with tourists\r\nattracted by the magnificent scenery it presents throughout the greater\r\npart of its length.\r\n\r\nBut whatever had previously been done in canal construction was\r\nsurpassed in enterprise and importance by Lesseps’ great work in Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _THE SUEZ CANAL._\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the idea of opening a waterway between the Red\r\nSea and the Mediterranean is by no means a product of the present\r\ncentury. The ancient Egyptians do not appear to have cut directly\r\nthrough the Isthmus, but Herodotus describes a canal made by Necho about\r\nthe year 600 B.C., from Suez through the Bitter Lakes to Lake Timsah and\r\nthen westward to Bubastis on the Nile. He mentions certain water gates,\r\nand states that vessels took four days in sailing through. This canal\r\nbecame silted up with sand ages ago, but it was cleared out again and\r\nre-opened in the seventh century of our era by the Caliph Omar, and\r\ntraces of it are still visible. According to some recent discoveries in\r\nthe chief archives of Venice, as early as the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, when Vasco da Gama had discovered the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nthe Portuguese took that new route to India, hitherto the exclusive\r\nproperty of the Venetian and Genoese merchants, a re-cutting of the\r\nIsthmus of Suez was thought of. Plans were prepared and embassies sent\r\nto Egypt for paving the way for the accomplishment of this great\r\nenterprise, which, it is said, was only foiled by the persistent\r\nopposition of some patricians, who were probably bribed by foreign gold\r\nto prevent the execution of the plan. One of our Elizabethan poets,\r\nChristopher Marlowe, appears, in the following lines, to have\r\nanticipated M. de Lesseps:—\r\n\r\n            “Thence marched I into Egypt and Arabia,\r\n            And here, not far from Alexandria,\r\n            Whereat the Terrene and the Red Sea meet,\r\n            Being distant less than full a hundred leagues.\r\n            I meant to cut a channel to them both,\r\n            That men might quickly sail to India.”\r\n\r\nFor at that period travellers going to India in the famous sailing\r\nships, called “East Indiamen,” were obliged to sail round the Cape of\r\nGood Hope and pass from the Southern to the Indian Ocean. The reader who\r\nwishes to understand the importance of the Suez Canal should look at the\r\nmap of the Eastern Hemisphere, where he will have no difficulty in\r\nfinding the position of the vast continent of Africa, which is washed on\r\nthe north by the Mediterranean Sea, on the west by the Atlantic, on the\r\nsouth by the Southern Ocean, and on the east and north-east by the\r\nIndian Ocean and the Red Sea. If he now traces the waterway round\r\nAfrica, on coming to the head of the Red Sea he will find the only\r\ninterruption of the oceanic continuity in the narrow neck of land called\r\nthe Isthmus of Suez. But for this, ships might long ago have made\r\ncomplete circuits round this vast, and, even as yet, but partially\r\nexplored continent. The circuit would, indeed, be a great one of some\r\n15,000 miles; but the barrier that the Isthmus presented to\r\ninter-oceanic communication between the eastern and the western worlds\r\nwas a piece of physical geography which has undoubtedly been a most\r\nimportant factor in determining the course of history. It has been said\r\nthat had there existed at Suez a strait like that of Gibraltar or that\r\nof Messina, instead of a sandy isthmus, the achievements of Diaz, Vasco\r\nda Gama, and Columbus would have lost much of their significance; but\r\nthe advantages to the world’s commerce would have been incalculable, and\r\nthe progress of the race might have been more rapid.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Napoleon I. had the idea of restoring the old canal; but it\r\nwas only when steam navigation had taken its place on the seas that the\r\nscheme was looked upon as offering any chance of financial success. But\r\nGeneral Chesney, who made some surveys for the French Government in\r\n1830, had come to the conclusion that there was a considerable\r\ndifference of level between the two seas—a difference, he calculated, of\r\nabout 30 feet. The existence of such a state of things would, of course,\r\nhave been very unfavourable for the undertaking; but the General’s\r\nsupposition was soon proved to have been erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of carrying out the project of constructing a ship canal\r\nthrough the Isthmus was seriously revived by Père Enfantin, the St.\r\nSimonian, in the year 1833. He then induced M. Ferdinand Lesseps, the\r\nFrench vice-consul, and Mehemet Ali, the Pasha of Egypt, to take some\r\npractical measures towards its accomplishment. Surveys were made, but\r\nowing to the breaking out of a plague, and to other causes, not much\r\nmore was heard of the scheme till 1845. In 1846 _La Société d’Etude du\r\nCanal de Suez_ was formed, and among those who turned their attention to\r\nthe subject was Robert Stephenson. His report was wholly unfavourable to\r\nthe enterprise. He recommended the construction of a railway through\r\nEgypt, and a line was accordingly made between Alexandria and Suez. But,\r\nnotwithstanding the opinion of Mr. Stephenson, M. Lesseps persevered\r\nwith wonderful energy, believing, on the report of other engineers, that\r\nthe scheme could be successfully carried out. It is right, however, to\r\nstate that Mr. Stephenson did not say it was impossible to complete the\r\nSuez Canal—he merely gave it as his opinion that the cost of making the\r\ncanal, and keeping it in a proper state for navigation, would be so\r\ngreat that the scheme would not pay. However, in 1854, the Viceroy of\r\nEgypt signed the concession, and in 1860 the work was actually\r\ncommenced, but not on a plan that was advocated by the English engineers\r\nof making the canal 25 feet above the sea level. There were also some\r\npolitical and financial difficulties to be overcome. The Suez Canal\r\nCompany, it was said, had expended twelve millions of money in what was\r\nconsidered to be chiefly shifting sands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 123.—_The Sand-Glass._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the Suez Canal was projected, many prophesied evil to the\r\nundertaking, from the sand of the Desert being drifted by the wind into\r\nthe canal, and others were apprehensive that where the canal was cut\r\nthrough the sand, the bottom would be pushed up by the pressure of the\r\nbanks. They imagined that the sand would behave exactly like the ooze of\r\na soft peat-bog, through which, when a trench has been cut, the bottom\r\nof the trench soon rises, for the soft matter has virtually the\r\nproperties of a liquid: it acts, in fact, exactly like very thick\r\ntreacle. Sand, however, is not possessed of liquid properties; it has a\r\ndefinite angle of repose, which is not the case with thin bog. This\r\nbehaviour of sand is familiarly illustrated in the sand-glass, which the\r\ndiagram Fig. 123, will recall to mind. It may be observed that the sand\r\nfalling in a slender stream from the upper compartment is in the lower\r\none heaped up in a little mound, the sides of which preserve a nearly\r\nconstant inclination of about 30°. In this property it is distinctly\r\ndifferent from peat-bog or such-like material, which has no definite\r\nangle of repose. It need hardly be said that all apprehensions as to the\r\nsafety of the canal from the causes here alluded to have proved\r\nunfounded.\r\n\r\nBut if some English engineers appeared to oppose the project, another\r\neminent one, Mr. Hawkshaw, certainly helped it on at a moment when the\r\nViceroy of Egypt was losing confidence; and, had his opinion been\r\nadverse to the project reported upon, the Viceroy would certainly not\r\nhave taken upon himself additional liability in connection with the\r\nundertaking, and the money expended up to that date would have been\r\nrepresented only by some huge mounds of sand and many shiploads of\r\nartificial stone, thrown into the bottom of the sea to make the harbour\r\nof Port Saïd. And that M. Lesseps appreciated the good offices of Mr.\r\nHawkshaw is shown from the fact that, when he introduced that engineer\r\nto various distinguished persons, on the occasion of the opening of the\r\ncanal, he said, “This is the gentleman to whom I owe the canal.” It\r\ncannot, therefore, be said of the English nation that they were jealous\r\nof the peaceful work of their French neighbours, or opposed it in any\r\nother sense but as a “non-paying” and apparently unprofitable scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Canal was opened in great state by Napoleon III.’s Empress Eugénie,\r\nin November, 1869, when a fleet of fifty vessels passed through, and the\r\nfact was thus officially announced in Paris:—“The canal has been\r\ntraversed from end to end without hindrance, and the Imperial yacht,\r\n_Aigle_, after a splendid passage, now lies at her moorings in the Red\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n“Thus are realized the hopes which were entertained of this great\r\nundertaking—the joining of the two seas.\r\n\r\n“The Government of the Emperor cannot but look with satisfaction upon\r\nthe success of an enterprise which it has never ceased to encourage. A\r\nwork like this, successfully accomplished in the face of so many\r\nobstacles, does honour to the energetic initiative of the French mind,\r\nand is a testimony to the progress of modern science.”\r\n\r\nAn Imperial decree was then issued, dated the 19th of November,\r\nappointing M. de Lesseps to the rank of Grand Cross of the Legion of\r\nHonour, in consideration of his services in piercing the Isthmus of\r\nSuez.\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal is 88 geographical, or about 100 statute miles long: its\r\naverage width is 25 yards, and the minimum depth, 26 feet. At intervals\r\nof five or six miles, the canal is widened, for a short space, to 50\r\nyards, forming thus sidings (_gares_) where only vessels can pass each\r\nother. At these, therefore, a ship has often to wait until a file of\r\nperhaps twenty steamers, coming the other way, has passed. Occasionally\r\na ship gets across, or “touches,” and then the canal is blocked for\r\nhours. So much inconvenience has been found from the restricted\r\ndimensions of the work, that in 1886 it was proposed to widen the canal,\r\nor, alternatively, to construct a second canal, and use the two like the\r\nlines of a railway, so that vessels would never have occasion to pass\r\neach other. The amount of traffic is very large, and has been steadily\r\nincreasing. Thus, in 1874, the tonnage of the vessels passing through\r\nwas 5,794,400 tons; in 1880, the tonnage was 8,183,313, and the receipts\r\nof the Company amounted to £2,309,218. In 1875, the British Government\r\npurchased, from the Khedive, £4,000,000 worth of shares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 124.—_A Group of Egyptian Fellahs, and their Wives._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Suez Canal is not so much a triumph of engineering as a monument of\r\nsuccessful enterprise and determination on the part of its great\r\npromoter, M. Lesseps, in the face of great difficulties. According to\r\nthe original programme, the canal was to have been constructed by forced\r\nlabour, supplied by the Viceroy. The unhappy peasantry of the country,\r\ncalled “fellahs,” were compelled to give their labour for a miserable\r\npittance of rice. No doubt, in ancient times, when forced labour was in\r\nuse, every peasant might cheerfully work, because it was for the general\r\nbenefit to bring sweet water from the Nile to other dry and thirsty\r\nplaces in Egypt; but to be obliged to work at a waterway of salt, which\r\nwas only to be of use to foreigners who passed through the country,\r\ncould not be expected of human beings, and therefore the carrying out of\r\nthe work was not unaccompanied by cruelties of the nature attending\r\nslave labour in other lands. This was one of the reasons why the late\r\nLord Palmerston opposed the canal scheme, for the kind hearted statesman\r\nbore in mind the loss of health and life occasioned to poor Egyptians by\r\nthis mode of labour, and the more so because it had been originally\r\nproposed that one of the conditions on which the French Company was to\r\ntake up the project should be the execution of the work by _free\r\nlabour_. In consequence, no doubt, of representations from free\r\ncountries, the Porte was induced to put a veto on the employment of\r\nforced labour, and everyone thought that this would be the deathblow to\r\nthe completion of the canal: but M. Lesseps did not give way to despair,\r\nand he since stated that if he had depended on the labours of the\r\nfellahs only, the difficulties of the work never could have been\r\nsurmounted; and that, in fact, the successful prosecution of the work\r\nwas owing to his having turned his attention to the mechanical\r\ncontrivances used for dredging on the Thames and the Clyde, from which\r\nhe obtained better results in half the time and at half the cost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 125.—_Dredges and Elevators at Work._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 126.—_Map of the Suez Canal._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe dredges used in the construction of the canal were of a new\r\ndescription. They were wonderful mechanical contrivances, and but for\r\nthem the canal would not have been finished. They were not the\r\ncontrivance of M. Lesseps, but of one of the contractors, a\r\ndistinguished engineer, who received his technical education in France\r\nbut his practical experience in England. The use of the dredging\r\nmachines was prepared for by digging out a rough trough by spade work,\r\nand as soon as it had been dug to the depth of from six feet to twelve\r\nfeet, the water was let in. After the water had been let in, the steam\r\ndredges were floated down the stream, moored along the bank, and set to\r\nwork. The dredges were of two kinds. The great _couloirs_ consisted of a\r\nlong, broad, flat bottomed barge, on which stood a huge framework of\r\nwood, supporting an endless chain of heavy iron buckets. The chain was\r\nturned by steam, and the height of the axle was shifted from time to\r\ntime, so that the empty buckets, as they revolved round and round,\r\nshould always strike the bottom of the canal at a fixed angle. As they\r\nwere dragged over the soil they scooped up a quantity of mud and sand\r\nand water, and as each bucket reached its highest point in the round, it\r\ndischarged its contents into a long iron pipe which ran out at right\r\nangles to the barge. The further extremity of this pipe stretched for\r\nsome yards beyond the bank of the canal, and therefore, when the\r\ndredging was going on, there was a constant stream of liquid mud pouring\r\nfrom the pipe’s mouth upon the shore, and thus raising the height of the\r\nembankment. When the hollow scooped out by the buckets had reached the\r\nrequired depth, the dredge was moved to another place, and the same\r\nprocess was repeated over and over again. These stationary dredges,\r\nhowever, though very effective, required much time in moving, and the\r\nlighter work of the canal was chiefly effected by movable dredges of a\r\nsmaller size. These machines were of the same construction as those\r\ndescribed; the only difference was that the mud raised by their agency\r\nwas not poured directly on shore by pipes attached to the dredges, but\r\nwas emptied in the first instance into large barges moored alongside the\r\ndredge. These barges were divided into compartments, each of which\r\ncontained a railway truck, and when the barge was filled it steered away\r\nto the bank, where an elevator was fixed. The trucks, filled with mud\r\nwere raised by a crane worked by steam power, and placed upon inclined\r\nrails, attached to the elevator, which sloped upwards at an angle of 45\r\ndegrees towards the bank. They were then drawn up the rails by an\r\nendless rope, and as each truck reached the end of the rails its side\r\nfell open, the mud was shot out upon the bank, and the empty truck\r\nreturned by another set of rails to the platform on which the elevator\r\nwas placed, and was thence lowered into the barge to which it belonged.\r\nAs the elevator could unload and re-load a barge much faster than the\r\ndredges could fill it with mud, each elevator was fed by half a dozen\r\ndredges, and thus the mud raised from the canal by several dredges was\r\ncarted away without difficulty at one and the same time. As these\r\nfloating dredges were much easier to shift than those encumbered by the\r\nlong _couloir_ pipes, the work of excavating the bed went on much more\r\nrapidly. But in places where there was any great mass of earth or sand\r\nto be removed, the large _couloirs_ could scoop out a given volume in a\r\nshorter time.\r\n\r\nThe traveller who wishes to see the canal should go to France, and,\r\nembarking at the port of Marseilles, cross the Mediterranean Sea, and\r\nsteam to Port Saïd, which is about 150 miles east of the port of\r\nAlexandria, where the isthmus is crossed by the railroad, and is used by\r\ntravellers to India, being known as the “overland route.” And this\r\nrailway conveys the mail to and from India, thus saving the great sea\r\nvoyage round Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. Nevertheless, it involves\r\ntwo transhipments—from the steamer to the rail at Alexandria, and from\r\nthe railway to the steamer at Suez.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 127.—_Port Saïd, the Mediterranean entrance to the Suez Canal._\r\n]\r\n\r\nLet us notice in order the places passed by the traveller in going from\r\nPort Saïd to Suez and the Red Sea. The arrow (Fig. 126) points in the\r\ndirection of the compass, and shows that the canal runs very nearly from\r\nnorth to south. Port Saïd is the little town at the northern or\r\nMediterranean entrance to the canal, situated on the flat sands at the\r\nentrance of the canal, and is built chiefly of wood, with straight wide\r\nstreets and houses, and although it now contains several thousand\r\ninhabitants, before the making of the canal was begun one hundred people\r\ncould hardly have been got together. The town contains nothing deserving\r\nof notice, and has a striking resemblance to the newly settled cities of\r\nAmerica. But in it reside agents who represent numerous varied\r\ninterests—administrative, financial, mercantile and political. It is\r\nprovided with docks, basins, quays and warehouses, and has a harbour\r\nstretching out a couple of miles or so into the sea, for to that\r\ndistance two piers, or rather breakwaters, run out.\r\n\r\nFig. 128 shows these two converging breakwaters, which have been built\r\nout into the Mediterranean from the coast, the larger and more westerly\r\none being one mile and a half long, the shorter about a mile and a\r\nquarter, and the distances between the two lighthouses erected on the\r\nextremities of the breakwater being half a mile.\r\n\r\nThe piers are made of concrete which was cast in blocks weighing 10 tons\r\neach. This composition has of late years been greatly approved by\r\nengineers where stone cannot be procured. The sea-face of the great\r\ncanal in Holland is composed of a similar artificial stone, and it is\r\nfound to bear the wear and tear of the waves almost, if not quite, as\r\nwell as ordinary stone. It is stated that 25,000 blocks, each weighing\r\n10 tons, were used. They were not laid with the regularity of ordinary\r\nmasonry, but had been dropped from large barges, so that they presented\r\na very rugged and uneven appearance (Fig. 129); but the object of\r\nthrowing out these great bulwarks is for the purpose of preventing the\r\nsand brought down by the Nile silting in and closing up the canal. Along\r\nthe western pier there is, from this cause, a constant settlement of\r\nsand, which was partially washed through the interstices left between\r\nthe blocks of artificial stone, and might have given some trouble by\r\nforming sandbanks in the harbour; but this was prevented by the\r\nintroduction of smaller stones, which could readily be carried out in\r\nboats at the low tide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 128.—_Bird’s-eye View of Port Saïd._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBeginning with the Mediterranean Sea and Port Saïd, there is a run of 28\r\nmiles to Kantara, through Lake Menzaleh. Although called a lake, it is,\r\nin truth, nothing but a shallow lagoon or swamp, in which water-fowl of\r\nall kinds are very abundant, the great flocks of white pelicans and pink\r\nflamingoes being especially striking. The waters of this lagoon cover\r\nlands that once were fertile, and the salt sea-sands doubtless conceal\r\nthe remains of many an ancient town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 129.—_One of the Breakwaters at Port Saïd._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf all portions of the undertaking, this one, M. Lesseps states, was the\r\nmost arduous and difficult, though, at the time, it attracted the least\r\nattention. A trough had to be dredged out of the bed of the shallow\r\nlagoon, and on either side of this hollowed out space high sandbanks had\r\nto be erected, and the difficulty of making a solid foundation for these\r\nsand banks was found to be extreme. The difficulty, however, was\r\nsurmounted, and such is the excellence of the work, that the water\r\nneither leaks out, nor does any of the brackish water of the lagoon\r\ninfiltrate and undermine the great embankments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 130.—_Lake Timsah and Ismaïlia._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt Kantara, the canal crosses the track of the highway between Cairo and\r\nSyria—a floating bridge carries the caravans across; and near this spot\r\nis stationed an Egyptian man-of-war, which supplies the police for the\r\nproper watch and ward of the canal. From Kantara to El Fendane is a\r\ndistance of 15 miles—that is to say, to the southern extremity of Lake\r\nBallah, where the canal still passes through sand embankments, raised\r\nwithin a mere. The lake is, however, almost dried up, and therefore the\r\ndifficulties which had to be surmounted at Lake Menzaleh were not felt\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe traveller may now be supposed to have arrived at Lake Timsah, where,\r\nno doubt, in the days of the Pharaohs, a lake existed. When taken in\r\nhand by M. Lesseps, it was a barren, sandy hollow, containing a few\r\nshallow pools, through which a man could easily wade, but now it is\r\nfilled with the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a pretty, inland,\r\nsalt water lake, about three miles in width. On the northern shore\r\nstands the town, or, rather, small settlement of Ismaïlia, which is, in\r\nfact, the “half way house” where most of the officials of the Suez Canal\r\nCompany resided, as they could get to either end of the canal with\r\ngreater facility, or to Cairo by the railroad, which comes to this\r\npoint, and continues, with the canal, to Suez.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 131.—_Railway Station at Ismaïlia._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the canal was opened, in November, 1869, Ismaïlia was the scene of\r\nthe most brilliant part of the opening ceremony, in which the French\r\nEmpress Eugénie, the Empress of Austria, the Crown Prince of Prussia,\r\nand other distinguished personages took share. The Khedive built himself\r\na summer palace, and M. Lesseps erected a villa, and the town was most\r\nartistically laid out, with every prospect of becoming a flourishing\r\nplace. But the drainage had been so entirely overlooked, that it is said\r\nthe sewage found its only outlet in the fresh water canal; and the\r\nconsequence was fever broke out and so infected the town, that it was\r\nsoon almost quite deserted. In 1882, Ismaïlia was once more the scene of\r\nbustle and activity, for here was the base of Sir Garnet Wolseley’s\r\noperations in his brilliant campaign against Arabi. The British Navy\r\nentered the canal, and took possession of Ismaïlia, where the army and\r\nthe military stores were rapidly concentrated. From this place, Sir\r\nGarnet advanced along the route of the railway and the Sweet Water\r\nCanal, and, after storming the lines of Tel-el-Kebir, occupied Cairo,\r\nwithout further resistance, after a campaign of only three weeks’\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nFrom Lake Timsah to the Bitter Lakes the canal again passes for eight\r\nmiles or so through the desert, where, by partial excavations by hand\r\nlabour and subsequent flooding to admit the dredges, it was considered\r\nthat a sufficiently deep channel could be made. The _couloirs_ were set\r\nto work, when suddenly “a lion arose in their path” in the shape of a\r\ngreat rock, about 80 feet in length, and lying 12 feet only below the\r\nsurface, and right in the middle of the main channel. If anything could\r\nshow the indomitable energy of M. Lesseps it was his courage in dealing\r\nwith this difficulty, and at a time when a few months only could elapse\r\nbefore the advertised day of the opening. He attacked the sunken rock\r\nwith gunpowder. A large raft, or floor, supported on barges, was moored\r\nover the sunken rock, and from this men, armed with long poles shod with\r\nsteel, drilled numerous holes, into which charges of gunpowder were\r\nplaced, and fired in the usual manner by the electric battery. This\r\ntemporary obstruction occurred opposite to the landing place at\r\nSérápeum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 132.—_The Viceroy of Egypt cutting the last embankment of the\r\n    Reservoir of the Plain of Suez, to unite the two seas—the\r\n    Mediterranean and the Red Sea._\r\n]\r\n\r\nPassing by Sérápeum, the traveller arrives at a vast expanse of water\r\ncalled the “Bitter Lakes,” because the dry sandy hollow formerly\r\ncontained a marsh, or mere, of very brackish water. The possibility of\r\nkeeping this great area filled with sea water had been denied by the\r\nopponents of the canal, who said the water would sink into the sand or\r\nbe evaporated by the intense heat of the sun; but none of these\r\nprognostications have been verified, and it is now a great inland sea,\r\nfar surpassing Lake Timsah, being 25 miles long and from six to seven\r\nmiles wide. The only difficulty in filling this enormous natural basin\r\narose from the rapidity and force with which the waters flowed in. This\r\nwas done when the water at Suez was at low tide, and then subsequently\r\nthe Red Sea was allowed to flow in. Though the expanse of water in the\r\nBitter Lakes is great enough, the available channel is still narrow. But\r\nthe steamers can proceed at full speed, as here there are no banks to be\r\nwashed away.\r\n\r\nSince the two seas have joined their waters, a strong current has set in\r\nfrom south to north, but there is no eddy or fall at the place where the\r\nwaters meet. The tide runs up the canal with great force, and there is a\r\ndifference of six or seven feet between high and low water: but the tide\r\ndoes not extend beyond the Bitter Lakes, where it is gradually diffused\r\nand lost. The colour of the current of water from Suez is said to be\r\ngreen, whilst that portion fed by the Mediterranean is blue. Since the\r\nBitter Lakes have been filled the mean temperature of the districts on\r\nthe banks has fallen 5° Centigrade. It is also stated that, although the\r\ncanal swarms with sea fish they keep to their respective ends of the\r\ncanal, as if the Mediterranean fish would not consort with those of the\r\nRed Sea, or, rather, make themselves at home in strange waters. There is\r\nalso, perhaps, another cause, and that is the very bitter nature of the\r\nwater at the northern end of the Bitter Lakes, which acts as a natural\r\nbarrier, through which the fish may decline to pass.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the Bitter Lakes is the only portion of the canal’s course in\r\nwhich it was not necessary to make a cutting. Buoys are laid down to\r\nmark the best channel, but such is the width and depth of the water that\r\nvessels need not exactly keep within them. Quitting the Bitter Lakes we\r\nagain enter the canal proper. In order to reach the vast docks which the\r\nSuez Canal Company has constructed on the western coast of the Red Sea,\r\nthe canal is now quitted, and the vessel crosses the neck of the Red\r\nSea. The Cairo and Alexandria Railway has been extended two miles, and\r\nis carried through the sea on an embankment, which lands the train close\r\nto the docks and quays of the canal, so that passengers by the overland\r\nroute are able to embark from the train on board the steamer, and thus\r\nescape the troublesome transhipment of themselves and luggage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _THE MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL._\r\n\r\nThe project of constructing a ship canal to connect Manchester with the\r\nsea appears to have been started just before the railway era, but it was\r\nthen abandoned, as the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Canal\r\nbrought about an immediate reduction in the rates of carriage. Perhaps\r\nit was the success of the Suez Canal which caused the revival of this\r\nscheme, in 1880, combined with the depression of the cotton trade at\r\nthat period, when the Liverpool dock dues and the comparatively high\r\nrailway rates proved a heavier tax than usual on the great Lancashire\r\nindustry. The first definite steps were taken two years afterwards, when\r\ntwo plans were submitted for the selection of a committee. One scheme\r\nproposed to construct the canal without any locks; but, as Manchester is\r\n60 feet above the sea level, there would, it was felt, be certain\r\ninconveniences in loading or unloading ships in a deep depression. The\r\nother plan was submitted by Mr. Leader Williams, a well known canal\r\nengineer, who proposed to take the canal from Runcorn, a distance of 20\r\nmiles, and making use of locks. When Parliament was applied to for\r\npowers authorizing the prosecution of the enterprise, there was, of\r\ncourse, much opposition offered by the various interests involved, and\r\nthe inquires before the Committees of each House of Parliament were\r\nunusually protracted, for they extended in all to 175 days, and the cost\r\nto the promoters is said to have amounted to £150,000. Then, when the\r\nBill had passed, it was found that the capital (£8,000,000) could not be\r\nraised owing to the financial depression, and partly also to some want\r\nof confidence in the soundness of the undertaking on the part of the\r\nLancashire capitalists. But the promoters submitted the whole scheme to\r\na representative committee, who should consider any possible objections.\r\nThis committee reported (after sitting almost daily for five weeks) upon\r\nevery point, and were unanimous in pronouncing the undertaking to be\r\nperfectly practicable and commercially sound. After this there was no\r\ndifficulty in raising the required capital, which was subscribed by\r\ncorporate bodies as well as private persons. The contract was let for\r\n£5,750,000, and the work was commenced in November, 1887, the contractor\r\nundertaking to have the canal completed and ready for traffic by January\r\n1st, 1892.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 133.—_Western Portion._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 134.—_Eastern Portion._\r\n\r\n  FIGS. 133 AND 134.—_Map of the Manchester Ship Canal._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Manchester Docks of this canal will cover an area of nearly 200\r\nacres at the south-western suburb of that city, and from there the canal\r\ntraverses the Valley of the Irwell, following, indeed, the general\r\ncourse of the river, but not its windings, so that the bed of the river\r\nis, in the distance of eight miles, or down to its junction with the\r\nMersey, repeatedly crossed by the line of the canal. From the confluence\r\nof the rivers, the canal traverses the Valley of the Mersey, for this is\r\nthe name retained by the combined streams. The course of the river, in\r\nits progress towards the sea, now makes wider bends, but the canal\r\nproceeds, by a slight and nearly uniform curve, to Latchford, near\r\nWarrington, passing to the south of which last named place it follows a\r\nstraight line to Runcorn, which is at a distance of 23 miles from\r\nManchester. Here it reaches what is now the estuary of the Mersey, but\r\nthe embankments are continued along the southern shore to Eastham, where\r\nthe terminal locks are placed. In this part of the canal, the engineer\r\nhad difficulties to overcome of a different nature from those\r\nencountered in the upper part, where it was chiefly a matter of cutting\r\nacross the ground intervening between the bends of the river, so as to\r\nform for its waters a new and direct channel everywhere of the requisite\r\nbreadth and depth. But when Runcorn has been passed, and Weston Point\r\nrounded, there is the mouth of the River Weaver to be crossed, and this\r\nis marked by a great expanse of loose and shifting mud. Other affluents\r\nof the Mersey are dealt with by means of sluices, and in one instance\r\nthe waters of a river are actually carried beneath the course of the\r\ncanal by conduits of 12 feet in diameter. The total length of the canal\r\nfrom Manchester to the tidal locks at Eastham is 35 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 135.—_A Cutting for the Manchester Ship Canal._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 136.—_Blasting Rocks for the Manchester Ship Canal._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe minimum width of the canal at the bottom is 120 feet, its depth 26\r\nfeet. But for several miles below Manchester this width will be\r\nincreased, so that ships may be moored along the sides, and yet\r\nsufficient space left for the up and down lines of traffic in the\r\nmiddle. In this way, works and manufactories on the banks will be able\r\nto load and unload their cargoes at their own doors, and it may be\r\nexpected that the advantages so offered will cause the banks of the\r\ncanal to be much in request for the sites of works of all kinds. At the\r\nseveral places where the locks are placed there will be a smaller and a\r\nlarger one, side by side, so that water shall not be needlessly used in\r\npassing a moderate sized vessel through the greater locks. As these last\r\nare 550 feet long and 60 feet wide, they are capable of receiving the\r\nlargest ships, whilst the smaller locks are 300 feet long and 40 feet\r\nwide. Again, both the larger and the smaller are provided with gates in\r\nthe middle, so that only half their length may be used when that is\r\nfound sufficient. Coming down the canal from Manchester, the first set\r\nof locks will be at Barton, about three miles distance, just below the\r\nplace where the Bridgewater Canal is carried across the Irwell, which is\r\nnow to become the ship canal, by means of the aqueduct of 1760, by which\r\nBrindley became so famous. There is a story told about Brindley being\r\ndesirous of satisfying the duke about the practicability of his plan,\r\nand requesting the confirmatory opinion of another engineer. When,\r\nhowever, this gentleman was taken to the place where it was proposed to\r\nconstruct the aqueduct, he shook his head, and said that he had often\r\nheard of castles in the air, but had never before been shown where any\r\nof them were to be erected. This aqueduct is about 600 feet long, and\r\nthe central one of its three arches spans the river at a height of\r\nnearly 40 feet above the water. But the Manchester Ship Canal requires a\r\nclear headway of 75 feet, and Mr. Williams is going to replace the fixed\r\nstone structure by a swinging aqueduct, or trough of iron, which can be\r\nturned round, so as to give a clear passage for ships in his canal. This\r\ntrough, or great iron box, will have gates at each end, and gates will\r\nbe provided in the aqueduct at each side, so that no water will be lost\r\nwhen the water bridge is turned aside. But more than this; hydraulic\r\nlifts have been designed, so that, in a few minutes, vessels can be\r\nlowered from the Bridgewater Canal into the Manchester Canal, or raised\r\nfrom the latter into the former while still floating in water. The\r\nsupply of water for the canal will be ample, as it has the rivers\r\nIrwell, Mersey and Bollin, with their tributary streams, to draw from.\r\nIt should be mentioned that the terminal locks at Eastham will be of\r\nsomewhat larger dimensions than those already referred to, and will be\r\nthree in number. The largest, which is on the south or landward side,\r\nwill be 600 feet by 80 feet, the middle one 350 feet by 50 feet, and the\r\nsmallest one 150 feet by 30 feet. These three locks will be separated by\r\nconcrete piers 30 feet wide, on which will be placed the hydraulic\r\nmachinery for opening and closing the gates. Besides the ordinary gates,\r\nthere will be provided for each lock at Eastham an outer pair of\r\nstorm-gates that will be closed only in rough weather. These gates will\r\nshut from the outside against the lock sills, and, by resisting the\r\nforce of wind and waves, will protect the ordinary tidal gates from\r\nbeing forced open. The lock gates throughout will be made of a wood\r\nobtained from British Guiana, and known as _greenheart_. This timber is\r\nthe product of a large tree (_Nectandra Rodiœi_) belonging to the laurel\r\nfamily. It is a very heavy and close grained wood, the strength and\r\nendurance of which have been proved many years ago by its use in\r\nship-building, etc., and some of the logs imported for the canal are\r\nremarkably fine specimens, being 22 inches square and 60 feet long. A\r\npair of the largest gates weigh about 500 tons. The gates of the tidal\r\nlocks at Eastham will all be open for half the time of each tide, when\r\nthere will be a depth of water, above the sills, greater by 11 feet than\r\nthat of any dock in Liverpool or Birkenhead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 137.—_Manchester Ship Canal Works, Runcorn._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe way in which the difficulty is overcome of crossing the several busy\r\nlines of railway that intersect the course of the new canal, so that\r\ntheir traffic shall not be impeded, is one of special interest in this\r\nbold scheme. The London and North Western Railway crosses the Mersey at\r\nRuncorn by a bridge that leaves a clear headway of 75 feet at high\r\nwater, and it was determined that this headway should be maintained in\r\nthe bridges over the canal. The use of swing bridges on lines of railway\r\nover which trains are constantly passing being out of the question, it\r\nis necessary that the railways be carried over the canal at the required\r\nheight. It is accordingly laid down in the Act of Parliament that before\r\nthe Canal Company can cut the existing lines of railway it shall\r\nconstruct permanent bridges, and carry over them lines rising by\r\ngradients not exceeding 1 in 135, and not only so, but these deviation\r\nlines must be previously given up to the several railway companies for\r\nsix months to be tried experimentally in that period for goods traffic.\r\nThe cost of constructing these deviation lines, which, in all, will not\r\nbe far short of 12 miles of new railway, will not be much less than\r\n£500,000. The traffic of the canal will probably have great feeders at\r\ncertain points in the other canals and the railway lines that reach it.\r\nFor instance, the Bridgewater Canal, now incorporated with the greater\r\nundertaking, will bring traffic from the Staffordshire potteries, the\r\nriver Weaver brings salt laden barges from Cheshire, and at other points\r\nthe railways will bring the produce of the excellent coal fields of\r\nSouth Yorkshire and South Lancashire, which will be automatically\r\ntransferred from the waggons into ocean going steamships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 137_a._—_The French Steam Navvy._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 137_b_.—_The English Steam Navvy._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThough the general notion of the construction of the canal as a deep,\r\nwide trench, or cutting following the course shown on the map, is\r\nsufficiently simple, the operation of carrying this into practice\r\ninvolves the exercise of great skill and ingenuity in dealing with\r\nmechanical obstacles. Man’s operations in the world consist but in\r\nchanging the position of masses of matter; and the properties of\r\nmatter—its inertia, cohesion, gravitation, etc., are the forces that\r\noppose his efforts. The quantity of matter to be shifted in excavating\r\nthis trench of thirty-five miles long across the country was no less\r\nthan sixty millions of tons. The number of “navvies” employed at one\r\ntime has been 15,000; but even this army of workmen would have made but\r\nslow progress with a cutting of this magnitude, had not the “strong\r\nshouldered steam” been also called into operation for scooping out the\r\nsoil. The illustrations (Figs. 137_a_ and #137_b_:fig137b) will show the\r\narrangement of two forms of “steam navvies” that were much used on the\r\nworks. One (Fig. 137_a_) is similar to the dredgers used for clearing\r\nmud out of rivers and canals: it consists of a series of scoops, or\r\nbuckets, mounted on an endless chain, so as to scrape the material from\r\nan inclined embankment and tip it into waggons for removal. The other\r\n(Fig. 137_b_) may be compared to a gigantic ladle made to scrape against\r\nthe face of a cutting in rising, and filling each time its bucket with\r\nnearly a ton of the material. It is most interesting to witness the\r\nperfect control which the man at the levers exercises over this machine,\r\nthe movements of which he directs with as much precision as if he were\r\nhandling a spoon. One of these steam navvies is able to fill 600 waggons\r\nor more—that is, to remove 3,000 tons of material—in one day; and as\r\nmany as eighty of them have been simultaneously used on the Canal works.\r\nThe value of the plant employed by the contractor is estimated at\r\n£700,000, and the length of temporary railway lines (see Fig. 137), for\r\ntransport of the “spoil,” etc., is said to exceed 200 miles. There is a\r\nmain line running through from one end of the canal to the other, and\r\nknown to the workmen as the “Overland Route.” From this diverge numerous\r\nbranches, some to the bottom of the excavations in progress, others to\r\nembankments down which is tipped out the “spoil,” as the dug out\r\nmaterial is called; while others connecting with brickfields and\r\nquarries, or with existing canals and railway lines, serve to bring\r\nsupplies of the materials used in the constructions. Some 150\r\nlocomotives are constantly at work on these temporary lines, and the\r\ncoal consumed by them, and by the steam navvies, steam cranes, pumping\r\nengines, etc., is equivalent to about two train loads every day.\r\n\r\nThough the Manchester Ship Canal is to be nearly twice as wide as the\r\nSuez Canal, its width for some miles below Manchester will be still\r\ngreater, for there the banks will form long continuous wharves for the\r\naccommodation of the works and factories that are certain to be\r\nattracted to the spot. Indeed, so obvious are the advantages of ocean\r\nshipment, and so extensive the industries of South Lancashire, that it\r\nis not improbable the whole course of the canal may, in process of time,\r\nbe lined with wharves, and the two great cities of Manchester and\r\nLiverpool may be united by a continuous track of dense population. Be\r\nthat as it may, there seems every reason to believe that the undertaking\r\nwill be a financial success. Calculation has shown that if the cotton\r\nalone that enters and leaves Manchester were carried by the canal at\r\nhalf the rates charged by the railways, there would result not only an\r\nannual saving of £456,000 to the cotton trade, but a clear profit to the\r\ncanal company sufficient to pay more than 3 per cent. interest on its\r\nown capital. And, again, the railway and other local interests that have\r\nhitherto been opposed to this great enterprise can hardly fail to be in\r\nthe long run benefited by the enlarged prosperity and increased general\r\ntrade and manufactures it will develop. So that it will presently be\r\nfound that there is room enough and work enough for both canal and\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nThe Manchester Ship Canal, so far from having been ready for traffic on\r\nthe 1st January, 1892, was not completed until the end of 1893, and it\r\nwas only on the 16th December, 1893, that the directors and their\r\nfriends made the trial trip throughout its entire length, accomplishing\r\nthe distance of 35½ miles in 5½ hours. The total cost of the canal was\r\ngreatly in excess of the estimates, which placed it at eight million\r\npounds, as fifteen millions is the sum actually expended upon it. With\r\nsuch a vast capital expenditure, it may be some time before the ordinary\r\nshareholders can look for dividends, especially as there has not been\r\nany sudden rush of traffic, such as many sanguine people expected. On\r\nthe other hand, traffic is continuously and steadily increasing, and\r\nthere is reason to believe that this great work will ultimately prove a\r\ncommercial, as it has an engineering, success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 137_c._—_Sketch Map of The North Sea Canal._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _THE NORTH SEA CANAL._\r\n\r\nLike several other canals for sea going ships this last addition to the\r\nachievements of modern engineering is but the realisation of a project\r\nconceived at a long past period. The idea of a canal to connect the\r\nBaltic and the North Sea dates back into the Middle Ages, and indeed a\r\nshort canal was constructed in 1389, which by uniting two secondary\r\nstreams of the peninsula really did provide a waterway between the two\r\nseas. The inefficiency of this means of communication may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact of there having been proposed since that period no fewer\r\nthan sixteen schemes of canalisation between these two seas, of which\r\nthe recently completed North Sea Canal is the sixteenth, and it need\r\nhardly be said the greatest, so that in comparison with it the rest\r\nvanish into insignificance. The canal was commenced in 1887, and on the\r\n20th of June, 1895, it was opened by the reigning Emperor of Germany,\r\nWilliam II., with a very imposing naval pageant in which nearly a\r\nhundred ships of war from the great navies of the world took part. A\r\nglance at the accompanying sketch-map will show the great importance of\r\nthis canal as a highway of commerce. The entrance to the Baltic has\r\nhitherto been round the peninsula of Denmark and through the narrow\r\n“belts” and “sounds” that divide the Danish Islands, a course beset with\r\nimminent perils to navigators, for the channels abound in rocks and\r\ndangerous reefs, to say nothing about the frequent storms and the\r\nimpediments of ice floes. Yet as many as 35,000 vessels have lately had\r\nto take that course annually, these representing a total tonnage of no\r\nless than 20,000,000 tons. The figures speak for the magnitude of the\r\nBaltic shipping intercourse with the rest of the world; while the losses\r\nincurred in traversing these forbidding waters may be gathered from the\r\nstatement that since 1858, nearly 3000 ships have been wrecked in them,\r\nand a greater number much damaged. Indeed, for large vessels, there is\r\nhardly a more dangerous piece of navigation in all Europe. The\r\nimportance of this canal must not therefore be estimated solely by the\r\nsaving of length in ships’ course, though that is great, as the map\r\nshows.\r\n\r\nThe North Sea Canal is 61 miles long, 200 ft. wide at the surface, 85\r\nft. wide at the bottom, and it will admit of vessels of 10,000 tons\r\nregister passing through, the average time of transit being about twelve\r\nhours. The estimated cost of this undertaking was nearly eight and a\r\nquarter million pounds sterling, and about one-third of this sum was\r\ncontributed by Germany, for whom the canal is of the greatest strategic\r\nimportance in case of war, for her fighting ships need not then traverse\r\nforeign waters. The construction was therefore pushed forward with\r\nunusual energy, as many as 8,600 men having been engaged on the works at\r\none time. An important naval station already exists at Kiel, the Baltic\r\nend of the canal, where there is a splendid harbour. The engineer and\r\ndesigner of this water-way is Herr Otto Baensch, who has devised much\r\ningenious machinery in connection with the immense tidal locks at the\r\nextremities of the canal, and the swing bridges by which several lines\r\nof railway are carried across it. In the construction of this canal\r\nthere were no vast engineering difficulties to be overcome, and hence\r\nstriking feats of mountain excavation or valley bridging are not to be\r\nmet with in its course, though in places there are some deep cuttings.\r\nThe methods of excavating and of steam dredging that were made use of\r\nhave already been illustrated in relation to the other works described\r\nin this article. The country through which the canal passes does not\r\npresent any unusually picturesque features.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _THE PANAMA AND NICARAGUA CANAL PROJECTS._\r\n\r\nThe several undertakings described in our chapter on Ship Canals are now\r\nall completed and in active operation, and but for financial\r\nmis-management and dishonest speculations, the same might probably have\r\nbeen said of another great project, the name of which was on everyone’s\r\nlips a short time ago, but in which public interest has lately waned;\r\nperhaps from a mistaken impression that the construction itself is\r\ninvolved in a common ruin with the fortunes of so many of its promoters,\r\nor that the scheme was frustrated by some unforeseen and insurmountable\r\nengineering difficulties. These assumptions have so little justification\r\nthat it is quite probable that Lesseps’ last great project may yet be\r\ncompleted under more favourable auspices, and the Panama Canal unite the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Panama Canal Company still exists, and\r\npossesses not only a very large part of the work almost quite finished,\r\nbut all the extensive plant in perfect condition for resuming\r\noperations. The original scheme provided for a tidal water-way between\r\nthe two oceans, without the intervention of a single lock. The canal was\r\nto be nearly 47 miles in length, 100 feet wide at the surface of the\r\nwater, 72 feet wide at the bottom, and 29 feet deep. The entrances are\r\nat Colon on the Atlantic side, and at Panama on the Pacific. The latter\r\nis the eastern extremity, and the western one is on the Atlantic side,\r\nowing to the configuration of the isthmus which curves round the Panama\r\nGulf that opens to the south. A railway crosses the isthmus between the\r\npoints already named, and the route of the canal is laid down almost\r\nparallel with this railway, from which it is nowhere far distant. For\r\nthe first 20 miles from the Atlantic side the land is only at a very\r\nmoderate elevation above the sea-level, say 25 or 30 feet, but the next\r\n11 miles is more hilly, the elevations reaching at some points 150 to\r\n170 feet, but these are only for short distances. A few miles farther\r\non, they rise still higher, until at Culebra the highest point is met\r\nwith, about 323 feet above the sea-level, and a cut of this depth, 1,000\r\nfeet long, would be required. Through this highest part it has been\r\nproposed to drive a tunnel, but the total extent of the deep cutting at\r\nthis part of the canal would be nearly 2 miles in length. This would no\r\ndoubt be a work of the most formidable magnitude, for it has been\r\ncalculated that no less than 24,000,000 cubic yards of material,\r\nconsisting for the most part of solid rock, would have to be removed. It\r\nis not supposed, however, to offer any great difficulty in an\r\nengineering point of view. Doubtless it would be costly, and would take\r\nsome time to accomplish. Another heavy piece of work would consist in\r\nconstructions for controlling a mountain torrent called the Rio Chagres,\r\nthrough the valley of which the canal passes. This stream is very\r\nvariable in the quantity of water it discharges, rising in the rainy\r\nseason 45 feet above its ordinary level, and sending down forty times as\r\nmuch water as it does in the dry season.\r\n\r\nMr. Saabye, an American engineer, who examined unofficially the works of\r\nthe Panama Canal in 1894, considers that about one half of the total\r\nexcavation has already been done, and one half of the total length of\r\nthe canal almost finished, and remaining in comparatively good\r\ncondition. At both ends, including 15 miles on the Atlantic side, there\r\nis water 18 to 24 feet deep. “Besides the work already done, the Canal\r\nCompany has on hand, distributed at both terminals, and at convenient\r\npoints along the canal route, an immense stock of machinery, tools,\r\ndredges, barges, steamers, tug-boats, and materials for continued\r\nconstruction. At Panama, La Boca, and Colon, as well as along the canal,\r\nare numerous buildings—large and small—for offices, workshops,\r\nstorehouses, and warehouses, and for lodging and boarding the men who\r\nwere employed on the work. The finished work, as well as all the\r\nmachinery, tools, materials, buildings, etc., are well taken care of and\r\nlooked after. The Canal Company employs one hundred uniformed policemen,\r\nbesides numerous watchmen, machinists, and others, whose sole duty\r\nconsists in watching the canal and looking after needed repairs of plant\r\nand care of materials. In fact, the work and the whole plant is in such\r\na condition, so far as I could ascertain, that renewed construction\r\ncould be taken up and carried to a finish at any time it is desired to\r\ndo so, after the Company’s finances will permit.”\r\n\r\nAn enormous amount of money has already been expended on the Panama\r\nCanal, and much of it lavishly and unnecessarily. A reorganised company\r\nmay probably be able to form such estimates of the probable cost of\r\ncompleting the work under careful and efficient management, that\r\nfinancial confidence in it maybe restored. The canal not only already\r\npossesses the requisite plant, but the route has the special advantages\r\nof assistance in transport from the railway everywhere at but a short\r\ndistance from it, and fine commodious harbours for its ocean mouths. If\r\nit were finished as originally designed, vessels could pass through it\r\nwith one tide, say in about six hours. It is understood that before the\r\nPanama enterprise is again proceeded with, the Company think that a sum\r\nof about £25,000 should be expended in a complete survey and re-study of\r\nall the conditions, and the results submitted to the most eminent\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nA rival scheme for carrying a ship canal across the isthmus that divides\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is that known as the Nicaragua Canal, as\r\nthe proposed route is to cross Lake Nicaragua, an extensive sheet of\r\nwater situated some 400 or 500 miles north-west of the Panama Canal. The\r\nlake is 110 miles long and 45 miles broad, and is on its western side\r\nseparated from the Pacific by a strip of land only 12 miles wide, having\r\nat one point an elevation not exceeding 154 feet, which is probably the\r\nlowest on the isthmus. The lake drains into the Caribbean Sea on the\r\neast, by the San Juan river, a fine wide stream, 120 miles in length,\r\nwhich is navigable for river boats from the Caribbean Sea up to the\r\nlake, except near its upper part, where some rapids at certain times\r\nprevent the passage of the boats. This canal project first took definite\r\nform in 1850, when a survey was made and routes reported on. The scheme\r\nattracted some attention in the United States, and in 1872, and again in\r\n1885, further surveys and estimates were made at the instance of the\r\nStates Government. The earlier schemes provided for the rise and fall\r\nbetween sea and lake-–108 feet, a considerable number of locks—eleven on\r\neach side, making the total length from sea to sea 181 miles. The report\r\nof the latter advocated the canalization of the San Juan by a very bold\r\nmeasure, namely, the construction of an immense dam, by which the waters\r\nwere to be retained in the valley for many miles at the level of the\r\nlake. A company was formed to promote the project, and again in 1890\r\nthere were more surveys and estimates made. This company actually\r\nexpended a considerable sum of money in attempting to improve the\r\nharbour at Greytown, which would have formed the eastern terminus, but\r\nhad become silted up. But it was found afterwards that it would be\r\nbetter to recommend the formation of an artificial harbour at another\r\npoint, by constructing two long piers running out into the sea, although\r\nthis change would involve the abandonment of a few hundred yards of\r\ncanal already excavated by the company near Greytown. The company has\r\nalso laid down about 12 miles of railway along the proposed route, with\r\nwooden and iron sheds as workshops, offices, etc., and, moreover, had\r\ndredges and other appliances at work. At this stage it was proposed that\r\nthe United States Government should guarantee the bonds of the Nicaragua\r\nCanal Company to the extent of more than twenty million pounds sterling.\r\nBy an Act of Congress passed in March, 1895, a commission of engineers\r\nwas appointed for the purpose of ascertaining the feasibility,\r\npermanence, and cost of construction and completion of the Nicaragua\r\nCanal by the route contemplated. The report of this commission is an\r\nelaborate and exhaustive review of the whole scheme based upon a\r\npersonal examination of the route, and on the plans, surveys, and\r\nestimates made for the company, whose records, however, are stated in\r\nthe report to be deficient in the supply of many important data. The\r\nCanal Company’s project provided for the improvement of Greytown\r\nharbour, as already stated, and from that place the canal was to proceed\r\nwestward at the sea-level to the range of high ground on the eastern\r\nside of the isthmus, which elevation was to be ascended by three locks\r\nof unusual depth, and a deep cut more than 3 miles in length, through\r\nrock to a maximum depth of 324 feet. After passing this enormous cut,\r\nthe route provides for a series of deep basins, in which the water is\r\nconfined by numerous dams or embankments, the canal excavations being\r\nconfined to short sections through higher ground separating these\r\nbasins. The total length of these embankments will be about 6 miles, and\r\ntheir heights will vary from a few feet to more than seventy. About 31\r\nmiles from Greytown the canal reaches the San Juan river, which,\r\nhowever, by means of an enormous dam across the valley at a place called\r\nOchoa, 69 miles below the point at which it receives the waters of Lake\r\nNicaragua, is there practically converted into an arm of the lake. This\r\ndam, which would raise the water of the river 60 feet above its present\r\nlevel, and would, of course, flood the valley back to the lake, is the\r\nmost notable feature of the project. Its maximum height would be about\r\n105 feet, and the weirs on its crest, to discharge the surplus water,\r\nwould require a total length of nearly a quarter of a mile. Twenty-three\r\nsmaller embankments would also be needed for retaining the waters; the\r\nriver would have to be deepened in the upper part, and a channel dredged\r\nout in the soft mud of the lake for 14 miles beyond the river. The big\r\nOchoa dam is said to have no precedent in engineering construction, on\r\naccount of its great height and the enormous volume of the waters it is\r\nintended to retain. No doubt its construction and safe maintenance are\r\nwithin the range of engineering skill, when a thoroughly exhaustive\r\nsurvey of the site has been made, and the necessary funds are\r\nforthcoming. From the western shore of the lake its level would also be\r\nextended by another great dam crossing the valleys of the Tola and the\r\nRio Grande, with a length of 2,000 feet and a height of 90 feet. The\r\ncanal would then be carried to the sea-level by a series of locks. The\r\nlength of the canal from sea to sea would be 170 miles, but of this only\r\n40 miles of channel would require to be excavated. The total cost of the\r\nwork, as estimated by the Nicaragua Canal Company, would be about\r\nfifteen million pounds sterling, but the State Commission of Engineers\r\nthinks about double that amount would be a safer calculation, and taking\r\ninto account the imperfection of the data, even this might be exceeded\r\nin certain contingencies. The Government of the United States has been\r\nurged to expend a few thousand pounds on another engineering commission,\r\nto make complete surveys, and consider all the practical problems\r\ninvolved, including the final selection of a route.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 138.—_Britannia Bridge, Menai Straits._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             IRON BRIDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe credit of having invented the arch is almost universally assigned to\r\nthe ancient Romans, though the period of its introduction and the date\r\nof its first application to bridge building are unknown. That some\r\ncenturies before the Christian era, the timber bridges of Rome had not\r\nbeen superseded by those of more permanent construction is implied in\r\nthe legend of the defence of the gate by Horatius Cocles—a tale which\r\nhas stirred the heart of many a schoolboy, and is known to everybody by\r\nMacaulay’s spirited verses, in which\r\n\r\n                   “Still is the story told,\r\n                   How well Horatius kept the bridge,\r\n                     In the brave days of old.”\r\n\r\nSome of the arched bridges built by the Romans remain in use to this day\r\nto attest the skill of their architects. The Ponte Molo at Rome, for\r\nexample, was erected 100 B.C.; and at various places in Italy and Spain\r\nmany of the ancient arches still exist, as at Narni, where an arch of\r\n150 ft. span yet remains entire. Until the close of the last century the\r\nstone or brick arch was the only mode of constructing substantial and\r\npermanent bridges. And in the present century many fine bridges have\r\nbeen built with stone arches. The London and Waterloo Bridges across the\r\nThames are well-known instances, each having several arches of wide\r\nspan, attaining in the respective cases 152 ft. and 120 ft. The widest\r\narch in England, and one probably unsurpassed anywhere in its\r\nmagnificent stride of 200 ft., is the bridge across the Dee at Chester,\r\nbuilt by Harrisson in 1820. At the end of last century _cast_ iron began\r\nto be used for the construction of bridges, a notable example being the\r\nbridge over the Wear at Sunderland, of which the span is 240 ft. But\r\nwith the subsequent introduction of _wrought_ iron into bridge building\r\na new era commenced, and some of the great results obtained by the use\r\nof this material will be described in the present article. In order that\r\nthe reader may understand how the properties of wrought iron have been\r\ntaken advantage of in the construction of bridges, a few words of\r\nexplanation will be necessary regarding the strains to which the\r\nmaterials of such structures are exposed.\r\n\r\nSuch strains may be first mentioned as act most directly on the\r\nmaterials of any structure or machine, and these are two in number,\r\nnamely, extension and compression. When a rope is used to suspend a\r\nweight, the force exerted by the latter tends to stretch the rope, and\r\nif the weight be made sufficiently great, the rope will break by being\r\npulled asunder. The weight which just suffices to do this is the measure\r\nof the _tenacity_ of the rope. Again, when a brick supports a weight\r\nlaid upon it, the force tends to compress the parts of the brick or to\r\npush them closer together, and if the force were great enough, the brick\r\nwould yield to it by being crushed. Now, a brick offers so great a\r\nresistance to a crushing pressure, that a single ordinary red brick may\r\nbe capable of supporting a weight of 18 tons, or 40,320 lbs.—that is,\r\nabout 1,000 lbs. on each square inch of its surface. Thus the bricks at\r\nthe base of a tall factory chimney are in no danger of being crushed by\r\nthe superincumbent weight, although that is often very great. The\r\n_tenacity_ of the brick, however, presents the greatest possible\r\ncontrast to its strength in resisting pressure, for it would give way to\r\na pull of only a few pounds. Cast iron resembles a brick to a certain\r\nextent in opposing great resistance to being crushed compared to that\r\nwhich it offers to being pulled asunder, while wrought iron far excels\r\nthe cast metal in tenacity, but is inferior to it in resistance to\r\ncompression.\r\n\r\nThe following table expresses the forces in tons which must be applied\r\nfor each square inch in the section of the metals, in order that they\r\nmay be torn apart or crushed:\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐\r\n │                       │ Tenacity per square  │Crushing pressure per │\r\n │                       │    inch, in tons.    │square inch, in tons. │\r\n ├───────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤\r\n │Cast iron              │          8           │          50          │\r\n │Wrought iron           │          30          │          17          │\r\n │Iron wire              │          40          │         ...          │\r\n └───────────────────────┴──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nBesides the direct strains which tend to simply elongate or compress the\r\nmaterials of a structure or of a machine, there are modes of applying\r\nforces which give rise to transverse strains, tending to twist or wrench\r\nthe pieces or to bend them, or rupture them by causing one part of a\r\nsolid to slide away from the rest. Strains of this kind no doubt come\r\ninto play in certain subordinate parts of bridges of any kind; but if we\r\ndivide bridges according to the nature of the strains to which the\r\nessential parts of the structure are subject, we may place in a class\r\nwhere the materials are exposed to crushing forces only, all bridges\r\nformed with stone and brick arches; and in a second class, where the\r\nmaterial is subjected to extension only, we can range all suspension\r\nbridges; while the third class is made up of bridges in which the\r\nmaterial has to resist both compression and extension. This last\r\nincludes all the various forms of girder bridges, whether trussed,\r\nlattice, or tubular. The only remark that need be here made on arched\r\nbridges is, that when cast iron was applied to the construction of\r\nbridges, the chief strength of the material lying in its resistance to\r\npressure, the principle of construction adopted was mainly the same as\r\nthat which governs the formation of the arch; but as cast iron has also\r\nsome tenacity, this permitted certain modifications in the adjustment of\r\nthe equilibrium, which are quite out of the question in structures of\r\nbrick and stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 139.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 140.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 141.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 142.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe general principle of the construction of girder bridges is easily\r\nexplained by considering a simple case, which is almost within\r\neverybody’s experience. Let us suppose we have a plank supported as in\r\nFig. 139. The plank will by its own weight sink down in the centre,\r\nbecoming curved in the manner shown; or if the curvature be not\r\nsufficiently obvious, it may always be increased by placing weights on\r\nthe centre, as at _g_. If the length of the plank had been accurately\r\nmeasured when it was extended flat upon the ground, it would have been\r\nfound that the upper or concave surface, _a b_, had become shorter, and\r\nthe lower or convex surface, _c d_, longer when the plank is supported\r\nonly at the ends—a result sufficiently obvious from the figure it\r\nassumes. It is plain, then, that the parts of the wood near the upper\r\nsurface are squeezed together, while near the lower surface the wood is\r\nstretched out. Thus, the portions in the vicinity of the upper and lower\r\nsurfaces are in opposite conditions of strain; for in the one the\r\ntenacity of the material comes into play, and in the other its power of\r\nresisting compression. There is an intermediate layer of wood, however,\r\nwhich, being neither extended or compressed, receives no strain. The\r\nposition of this is indicated by the line _e f_, called the _neutral\r\nline_. If the plank, instead of being laid flat, is put upon its edge,\r\nas in Fig. 140, the deflection caused by its weight will hardly be\r\nperceptible, and it will in this position support a weight which in its\r\nformer one would have broken it down. There is in this case a neutral\r\nline, _e f_, as before; but as the part which is most compressed or\r\nextended is now situated at a greater distance from the neutral line,\r\nthe resistance of the material acts, as it were, at a greater leverage.\r\nAgain the portions near the neutral line are under no strain; they do\r\nnot, therefore, add to the strength, although they increase the weight\r\nto be supported, and they may, for that reason, be removed with\r\nadvantage, leaving only sufficient wood to connect the upper and lower\r\nportions rigidly together. The form of cast iron beams, Fig. 141, which\r\nwere used for many purposes, depends upon these principles. The\r\nsectional area of the lower flange, which is subjected to tension, is\r\nsix times that of the upper one, which has to resist compression,\r\nbecause the strength of cast iron to resist pressure is about six times\r\ngreater than its power of resisting a pull. If the upper flange were\r\nmade thicker, the girder would be weaker, because the increased weight\r\nwould simply add to the tension of the lower one, where, therefore, the\r\ngirder would be more ready to give way than before. If we suppose the\r\nvertical web divided into separate vertical portions, and disposed as at\r\nFig. 142, the strength of the girder, and the principle on which that\r\nstrength depends, will be in no way changed, and we at once obtain the\r\nbox girder, which on a large scale, and arranged so that the roadway\r\npasses through it, forms the tubular bridge. It is only necessary that\r\nthe upper part should have strength enough to resist the compressing\r\nforce, and the lower the extending force, to which the girder may be\r\nsubject; and wrought iron, properly arranged, is found to have the\r\nrequisite strength in both ways, without undue weight. The various forms\r\nof trussed girders, the trellis and the lattice girders, now so much\r\nused for railway bridges, all depend upon the same general principles,\r\nas does also the Warren girder, in which the iron bars are joined so as\r\nto form a series of triangles, as in Fig. 143.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 143.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGirders have been made of wrought iron up to 500 ft. in length, but the\r\ncost of such very long girders is so great, that for spans of this width\r\nother modes of construction are usually adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _GIRDER BRIDGES._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 144.—_Section of a Tube of the Britannia Bridge._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Britannia Bridge, which carries the Chester and Holyhead Railway\r\nacross the Menai Straits, is perhaps the most celebrated example of an\r\niron bridge on the girder principle. It was designed by Stephenson, but\r\nthe late Sir W. Fairbairn contributed largely by his knowledge of iron\r\nto the success of the undertaking, if he did not, in fact, propose the\r\nactual form of the tubes. Stephenson fixed upon a site about a mile\r\nsouth of Telford’s great suspension bridge, because there occurred at\r\nthis point a rock in the centre of the stream, well adapted for the\r\nfoundation of a tower. This rock, which rises 10 ft. above the low-water\r\nlevel, is covered at high water to about the same depth. On this is\r\nbuilt the central tower of the bridge, 460 ft. from the shore on either\r\nside, where rises another tower, and at a distance from each of these of\r\n230 ft. is a continuous embankment of stone, 176 ft. long. The towers\r\nand abutments are built with slightly sloping sides, the base of the\r\ncentral or Britannia tower being 62 ft. by 52 ft., the width at the\r\nlevel where the tubes pass through it, a height of 102 ft., being\r\nreduced by the tapering form to 55 ft. The total height of the central\r\ntower is 230 ft. from its rock foundation. The parapet walls of the\r\nabutments are terminated with pedestals, the summits of which are\r\ndecorated by huge lions, looking landwards. As each line of rails has a\r\nseparate tube, there are four tubes 460 ft. long for the central spans,\r\nand four 230 ft. long for the shorter spans at each end of the bridge.\r\nEach line of rails, in fact, traverses a continuous tube 1,513 ft. in\r\nlength, supported at intervals by the towers and abutments. The four\r\nlonger tubes were built up on the shore, and were floated on pontoons to\r\ntheir positions between the towers, and raised to the required elevation\r\nby powerful hydraulic machinery. The external height of each tube at the\r\ncentral tower is 30 ft., but the bottom line forms a parabolic curve,\r\nand the other extremities of the tubes are reduced to a height of 22¾\r\nft. The width outside is 14 ft. 8 in. Fig. 144 shows the construction of\r\nthe tube, and it will be observed that the top and bottom are cellular,\r\neach of the top cells, or tubes, being 1 ft. 9 in. wide, and each of the\r\nbottom ones 2 ft. 4 in. The vertical framing of the tube consists\r\nessentially of bars of ⟙-iron, which are bent at the top and bottom, and\r\nrun along the top and bottom cells for about 2 ft. The covering of the\r\ntubes is formed of plates of wrought iron, rivetted to ⟙- and ∟-shaped\r\nribs. The thickness of the plates is varied in different parts from ½\r\nin. to ¾ in. The plates vary also in their length and width in the\r\ndifferent parts of the tubes, some being 6 ft. by 1¾ ft., and others 12\r\nft. by 2 ft. 4 in. The joints are not made by overlapping the plates,\r\nbut are all what are termed _butt_ joints, that is, the plates meet edge\r\nto edge, and along the juncture a bar of ⟙-iron is rivetted on each\r\nside, thus: ╬. The cells are also formed of iron plates, bolted together\r\nby ∟-shaped iron bars at the angles. The rails rest on longitudinal\r\ntimber sleepers, which are well secured by angle-iron to the ⟙-ribs of\r\nthe framing forming the lower cells. More than two millions of rivets\r\nwere used in the work, and all the holes for them, of which there are\r\nseven millions, were punched by special machinery. The rivets being\r\ninserted while red hot, and hammered up, the contraction which took\r\nplace as they cooled drew all the plates and ribs very firmly together.\r\nIn the construction of the tubes no less than 83 miles of angle-iron\r\nwere employed, and the number of separate bars and plates is said to be\r\nabout 186,000. The expansion and contraction which take place in all\r\nmaterials by change of temperature had also to be provided for in the\r\nmode of supporting the tubes themselves. This was accomplished by\r\ncausing the tubes, where they pass through the towers, to rest upon a\r\nseries of rollers, 6 in. in diameter, and these were arranged in sets of\r\ntwenty-two, one set being required for each side of each tube, so that\r\nin all thirty-two sets were needed. There are other ingenious\r\narrangements for the same purpose at the ends of the tubes resting on\r\nthe abutments, which are supported on balls of gun-metal, 6 in. in\r\ndiameter, so that they may be free to move in any manner which the\r\ncontractions and expansions of the huge tubes may require. Each of the\r\ntubes, from end to end of the bridge, contains 5,250 tons of iron. The\r\nmode in which these ponderous masses were raised into their elevated\r\nposition is described in the article on “Hydraulic Power,” as it\r\nfurnishes a very striking illustration of the utility and convenience of\r\nthat contrivance. The foundation-stone of the central tower was laid in\r\nMay, 1846, and the bridge was opened in October, 1850. The tubes have\r\nsome very curious acoustic properties: for example, the sound of a\r\npistol-shot is repeated about half a dozen times by the echoes, and the\r\ntubular cells, which extend from one end of the bridge to the other,\r\nwere used by the workmen engaged in the erection as speaking-tubes. It\r\nis said that a conversation may thus be carried on with a person at the\r\nother end of the bridge, a distance of a quarter of a mile. The rigidity\r\nof the great tubes is truly wonderful. A very heavy train, or the\r\nstrongest gale, produces deflections in the centre, vertical and\r\nhorizontal respectively, of less than one inch. But when ten or a dozen\r\nmen are placed so that they can press against the sides of the tube,\r\nthey are able, by timing their efforts so as to agree with the period of\r\noscillation proper to the tube, to cause it to swing through a distance\r\nof 1¼ in.—an illustration of facts of great importance in mechanics,\r\nshowing that even the most strongly built iron structure has its own\r\nproper period of oscillation as much as the most slender stretched wire,\r\nand that comparatively small impulses can, by being isochronous with the\r\nperiod of oscillation, accumulate, as it were, and produce powerful\r\neffects. Bridges are often tried by causing soldiers to march over them,\r\nand such regulated movements form the severest test of the freedom of\r\nthe structures from dangerous oscillation. The main tubes of the\r\nBritannia Bridge make sixty-seven vibrations per minute. The expansion\r\nand contraction occurring each day show a range of from ½ in. to 3 in.\r\nThe total cost of the structure was £601,865.\r\n\r\nA stupendous tubular bridge has also been built over the St. Lawrence at\r\nMontreal, and the special difficulties which attended its construction\r\nrender it perhaps unsurpassed as a specimen of engineering skill. The\r\nmagnitude of the undertaking may be judged of from the following\r\ndimensions: Total length of the Victoria Bridge, Montreal, 9,144 ft., or\r\n1¾ miles; length of tubes, 6,592 ft., or 1¼ miles: weight of iron in the\r\ntubes, 9,044 tons; area of the surface of the ironwork, 32 acres; number\r\nof piers, 24, with 25 spans between the piers, each from 242 ft. to 247\r\nft. wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 145.—_Albert Bridge, Saltash._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother singular modification of the girder principle occurs in the\r\nbridge built by Brunel across a tidal river at Saltash, Fig. 145. Here\r\nonly a single line of rails is carried over the stream, which is,\r\nhowever, 900 ft. wide, and is crossed by two spans of about 434 ft.\r\nwide. A pier is erected in the very centre of the stream, in spite of\r\nthe obstacles presented by the depth of the water, here 70 ft., and by\r\nthe fact that below this lay a stratum of mud 20 ft. in depth before a\r\nsound foundation could be reached. This work was accomplished by sinking\r\na huge wrought iron cylinder, 37 ft. in diameter and 100 ft. in height,\r\nover the spot where the foundation was to be laid. The cylinder\r\ndescended by its own weight through the mud, and when the water had been\r\npumped out from its interior, the workmen proceeded to clear away the\r\nmud and gravel, till the rock beneath was reached. On this was then\r\nbuilt, within the cylinder, a solid pillar of granite up to the\r\nhigh-water level, and on it were placed four columns of iron 100 ft.\r\nhigh, each weighing 150 tons. The two wide spans are crossed by girders\r\nof the kind known as “bow-string” girders, each having a curved\r\nelliptical tube, the ends of which are connected by a series of iron\r\nrods, forming a catenary curve like that of a suspension bridge. To\r\nthese chains, and also to the curved tubes, the platform bearing the\r\nrails is suspended by vertical suspension bars, and the whole is\r\nconnected by struts and ties so nicely adjusted as to distribute the\r\nstrains produced by the load with the most beautiful precision. When the\r\nbridge was tested, a train formed wholly of locomotives, placed upon the\r\nentire length of the span, produced a deflection in the centre of 7 in.\r\nonly. This bridge has sometimes been called a suspension bridge because\r\nof the flexible chords which connect the ends of the bows; but this\r\ncircumstance does not in reality bring the bridge as a whole under the\r\nsuspension principle. The section of the bow-shaped tube is an ellipse,\r\nof which the horizontal diameter is 16 ft. 10 in. and the vertical\r\ndiameter 12 ft., and the rise in the centre about 30 ft. Beside the two\r\nfine spans which overleap the river, the bridge is prolonged on each\r\nside by a number of piers, on which rest ordinary girders, making its\r\ntotal length 2,240 ft., or nearly half a mile; 2,700 tons of iron were\r\nused in the construction. As in the case of the Britannia Bridge, the\r\ntubes were floated to the piers, and then raised by hydraulic pressure\r\nto their position 150 ft. above the level of the water. The bridge was\r\nopened by the late Prince Consort in 1860, and has received the name of\r\nthe Albert Bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _SUSPENSION BRIDGES._\r\n\r\nThe general principle of the suspension bridge is exemplified in a chain\r\nhanging between two fixed points on the same level. If two chains were\r\nplaced parallel to each other, a roadway for a bridge might be formed by\r\nlaying planks across the chains, but there would necessarily be a steep\r\ndescent to the centre and a steep ascent on the other side. And it would\r\nbe quite impossible by any amount of force to stretch the chains into a\r\nstraight line, for their weight would always produce a considerable\r\ndeflection. Indeed, even a short piece of thin cord cannot be stretched\r\nhorizontally into a perfectly straight line. It was, therefore, a happy\r\nthought which occurred to some one, to hang a roadway from the chains,\r\nso that it might be quite level, although they preserved the necessary\r\ncurve. In designing such bridges, the engineer considers the platform or\r\nroadway as itself constituting part of the chain, and adjusts the loads\r\nin such a manner that the whole shall be in equilibrium, so that if the\r\nplatform were cut into sections, the level of the road would not be\r\nimpaired.\r\n\r\nPublic attention was first strongly drawn to suspension bridges by the\r\nengineer Telford, who, in 1818, undertook to throw such a bridge across\r\nthe Menai Straits, and the work was actually commenced in the following\r\nyear. The Menai Straits Suspension Bridge has been so often described,\r\nthat it will be unnecessary to enter here into a lengthy account of it,\r\nespecially as space must be reserved for some description of other\r\nbridges of greater spans. The total length of this bridge is 1,710 ft.\r\nThe piers are built of grey Anglesea marble, and rise 153 ft. above the\r\nhigh-water line. The distance between their centres is 579 ft. 10½ in.,\r\nand the centres of the main chains which depend from them are 43 ft.\r\nbelow the line joining the points of suspension. The roadway is 102 ft.\r\nabove the high-water level, and it has a breadth of 28 ft., divided into\r\ntwo carriage-ways separated by a foot-track. The chains are formed of\r\nflat wrought iron bars, 9 ft. long, 3¼ in. broad, and 1 in. thick. In\r\nthe main chains, of which there are sixteen, no fewer than eighty such\r\nbars are found at any point of the cross section, for each link is\r\nformed of five bars. These bars are joined by cross-bolts 3 in. in\r\ndiameter. The main chains are connected by eight transverse stays formed\r\nof cast iron tubes, through which pass wrought iron bolts, and there are\r\nalso diagonal ties joining the ends of the transverse stays. The time\r\noccupied in the construction was 6½ years, and the cost was £120,000.\r\nThis bridge has always been regarded with interest for being the first\r\nexample of a bridge on the suspension principle carried out on the large\r\nscale, and also for its great utility to the public, who, instead of the\r\nhazardous passage over an often stormy strait, have now the advantage of\r\na safe and level roadway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 146.—_Clifton Suspension Bridge, near Bristol._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Clifton Suspension Bridge over the Avon, near Bristol, is noted for\r\nhaving a wider span than any other bridge in Great Britain, and it is\r\nremarkable also for the great height of its roadway. The distance\r\nbetween the centres of the piers—that is, the distance of the points\r\nbetween which the chains are suspended—is more than 702 ft. Part of the\r\nironwork for this bridge was supplied from the materials of a suspension\r\nbridge which formerly crossed the Thames at London, and was removed to\r\nmake room for the structure which now carries the railway over the river\r\nto the Charing Cross terminus. Five hundred additional tons of ironwork\r\nwere used in the construction of the Clifton Bridge, which is not only\r\nmuch longer than the old Hungerford Bridge, but has its platform of more\r\nthan double the width, viz., 31 ft. wide, instead of 14 ft. A view of\r\nthis bridge is given in Fig. 146, where its platform is seen stretching\r\nfrom one precipitous bank of the rocky Avon to the other, and the river\r\nplacidly flowing more than 200 ft. below the roadway. The picturesque\r\nsurroundings of this elegant structure greatly enhance its appearance,\r\nand the view looking south from the centre of the bridge itself is\r\ngreatly admired, although the position may be at first a little trying\r\nto a spectator with weak nerves. The work is also of great public\r\nconvenience, as it affords the inhabitants of the elevated grounds about\r\nClifton a direct communication between Gloucestershire and\r\nSomersetshire, thus avoiding the circuitous route through Bristol, which\r\nwas required before the completion of the bridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe use of iron wire instead of wrought bars has enabled engineers to\r\nfar exceed the spans of the bridges already described. The table on page\r\n199 shows that iron wire has a tenacity nearly one-third greater than\r\nthat of iron bars, and this property has been taken advantage of in the\r\nsuspension bridge which M. Chaley has thrown over the valley at\r\nFribourg, in Switzerland. This bridge has a span of no less than 880\r\nft., and is constructed entirely of iron wires scarcely more than ⅒ in.\r\nin diameter. The main suspension cables, of which there are two on each\r\nside, are formed of 1,056 threads of wire, and have a circular section\r\nof 5½ in. diameter. The length of each cable is 1,228 ft., and at\r\nintervals of 2 ft. the wires are firmly bound together, so as to\r\npreserve its circular form. But as the cable approaches the piers, the\r\nwires are separated, and the two cables on each side unite by the\r\nspreading out of the wires into one flat band of parallel wire, which\r\npasses over the rollers at the top of the piers, and is again divided\r\ninto eight smaller cables, which are securely moored to the ground. Each\r\nof the mooring cables is 4 in. in diameter, and is composed of 528\r\nwires. In order to obtain a secure attachment for the mooring cables,\r\nshafts were sunk in the solid rock 52 ft. deep, and the ingenious mode\r\nin which, by means of inverted arches, an anchorage in the solid rock is\r\nformed for the cables, will be understood by a reference to Fig. 147.\r\nThe cables pass downwards through an opening made in each of the middle\r\nstones, and are secured at the bottom by stirrup-irons and keys. The\r\nsuspension piers are built of blocks of stone, very carefully shaped and\r\nput together with cramps and ties, so as to constitute most substantial\r\nstructures. These piers are embellished with columns and entablatures,\r\nforming Doric porticoes, enclosing the entrances to the bridge, which\r\nare archways 43 ft. high and 19 ft. wide. The roadway is 21 ft. wide,\r\nand is supported on transverse beams, 5 ft. apart, upon which is laid\r\nlongitudinal planking covered by transverse planking. The roadway beams\r\nare suspended to the main cables by vertical wire cables, 1 in. in\r\ndiameter. The length of these suspension cables of course varies\r\naccording to their position, the shortest being ½ ft. and the longest 54\r\nft. in length. Each suspension cable is secured by the doubling back of\r\nthe wires over a kind of stirrup, through which passes a plate of iron,\r\nsupported by the two suspension cables, the latter being close together,\r\nand, indeed, only separated by the thickness of the suspension cables,\r\nwhich hang between them. The roadway has a slight rise towards the\r\ncentre, its middle point being from 20 to 40 in. above the level of the\r\nends, according to the temperature.\r\n\r\nTo test the stability of the bridge, fifteen heavy pieces of artillery,\r\naccompanied by fifty horses and 300 people, were made to traverse it at\r\nvarious speeds, and the results were entirely satisfactory. Indeed, a\r\nfew years afterwards the people of Fribourg had another wire bridge\r\nthrown over the gorge of Gotteron, at about a mile from the former.\r\nThis, though not so long (640 ft.), spans the chasm at a great height,\r\nand in this respect is probably not surpassed by any bridge in the\r\nworld—certainly not by any the length of which can compare with its own.\r\nThe height of the roadway above the valley is 317 ft., or about the same\r\nas that of the golden gallery of St. Paul’s Cathedral above the street.\r\nThe structure is very light, and the sensation experienced when, looking\r\n_vertically_ downwards through the spaces between the flooring boards,\r\nyou see the people below diminished to the apparent size of flies, and\r\nactually feel yourself suspended in mid-air, is very peculiar, as the\r\nwriter can testify.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have, however, outspanned all the rest of the world in\r\ntheir wire suspension bridges. They have thrown a suspension bridge of\r\n800 ft. span over the Niagara at a height of 260 ft. above the water, to\r\ncarry not only a roadway for ordinary traffic, but a railway. Suspension\r\nbridges are not well adapted for the latter purpose, but there seemed no\r\nother solution of the problem possible under the circumstances. The\r\nbridge, however, combines to a certain extent the girder with the\r\nsuspension principle. The girder which _hangs_ from the main cables (for\r\nthey are made of wire), carries the railway, and below this is the\r\nsuspended roadway for passengers and ordinary carriages. The engineer of\r\nthis work was Roebling, who also designed many other suspension bridges\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nThe spans of any European bridges are far exceeded by that of the wire\r\nsuspension bridge which crosses the Ohio River at Cincinnati, with a\r\nstride of more than 1,000 ft.; and this is, in its turn, surpassed by\r\nanother bridge which has been thrown over the Niagara. This bridge,\r\nwhich must not be confounded with the one mentioned above, or with the\r\nClifton Bridge in England already described, merits a detailed\r\ndescription from the audacity of its span, which is nearly a quarter of\r\na mile, and entitles it to the distinction of being the longest bridge\r\nin the world of one span.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147_a_.—_Clifton Suspension Bridge, Niagara._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe new suspension bridge at the Niagara Falls, called the Clifton\r\nBridge, of which a view is given in Fig. 147_a_, is intended for the use\r\nof passengers and carriages visiting the Falls, and it is also the means\r\nof more direct communication between several small towns near the banks\r\nof the river. The bridge is situated a short distance below the Falls,\r\ncrossing the river at right angles to its course at a point where the\r\nrocks which form the banks are about 1,200 ft. apart. The distance\r\nbetween the centres of the towers is 1,268 ft. 4 in., and the bridge has\r\nby far the longest single span of any bridge in the world, the distance\r\nbetween the points of suspension being more than twice that of the Menai\r\nBridge, and more than six times the span of the widest stone bridge in\r\nEngland. This remarkable suspension bridge was constructed by Mr. Samuel\r\nKeefer, and was opened for traffic on the 1st of January, 1869, the\r\nactual time employed in the work having been only twelve months. The\r\ncables and suspenders are made of wire, which was drawn in England at\r\nWarrington and Manchester, and the wires for the main cables were made\r\nof such a length, that each wire passed from end to end of the cable\r\nwithout weld or splice. The length of each of the two main cables is\r\n1,888 ft., and of this length 1,286 ft. usually hangs between the\r\nsuspending towers, the centre being about 90 ft. below the level of the\r\npoints of suspension. This last distance, however, varies considerably\r\nwith the temperature, for in winter the contraction produced by the cold\r\nbrings up the centre to 89 ft. below the level line, while in summer it\r\nmaybe 3 ft. lower. The centre of the bridge is about 190 ft. above the\r\nwater in summer, and 193 ft. in winter. The cables are each formed of\r\nseven wire ropes, and each rope consists of seven strands, each strand\r\ncontaining nineteen No. 9 Birmingham gauge wires of the diameter of\r\n0·155 in. The cables of this bridge do not hang in vertical planes,\r\nsince in the centre they are only 12 ft. apart; while at the towers,\r\nwhere they pass over the suspension rollers, they are 42 ft. apart. The\r\nend of the platform which rests on the right bank is 5 ft. higher than\r\nthe other, and if a straight line were drawn from one end to the other,\r\nthe centre of the roadway would be in winter 7 ft. above it, and in\r\nsummer 4 ft. From each point of suspension twelve wire ropes, called\r\n“stays,” pass directly to certain points of the platform. The stays are\r\nnot attached to the cables, but pass over rollers on the tops of the\r\ntowers, and are anchored in the rock, independently of the cables. The\r\nlongest stays are tangential to the curve formed by the main cables, and\r\nthey are fixed to the platform at a point about half-way to the centre.\r\nOther stays proceed from the platform at intervals of 25 ft., between\r\nthe longest and the end of the bridge. The thickness of the stays is\r\nvaried according to the strain they have to bear, and they form not only\r\na great additional support to the platform, but they also serve to\r\nstiffen the bridge and lessen the horizontal oscillations to which the\r\nplatform would be liable from the shifting loads it has to bear. There\r\nare also stays which transversely connect the two cables. The wire ropes\r\nby which the platform is suspended to the main cables are ⅝ths of an\r\ninch in diameter, and have such a strength that the material would only\r\nyield to a strain of 10 tons. These suspenders are placed 5 ft. apart\r\nand are 480 in number, the lengths, of course, being different according\r\nto the position. To each pair of suspenders is attached a transverse\r\nbeam, 13½ ft. long, 10 in. deep, and 2½ in. wide. Upon these beams—which\r\nare, of course, 5 ft. apart from centre to centre—rests the flooring,\r\nformed of two layers of pine planking 1½ in. thick; and the roadway thus\r\nformed constitutes a single track 10 ft. in width. Along each side of\r\nthe platform is a truss the whole length of the bridge, formed of an\r\nupper and a lower beam, 6½ ft. apart, united by ties and diagonal\r\npieces. The lower chord of the truss is 2 ft. below the road, and on it\r\nrolled iron bars are bolted continuously from one end of the bridge to\r\nthe other. The last arrangement contributes greatly to stiffen the\r\nplatform, vertically and horizontally. In the central part of the bridge\r\nthe flooring-boards are bolted up to the cables, and there are studs\r\nformed of 2 in. iron tubes, so that the platform cannot be lifted\r\nvertically without raising the cables also; and as thus 81 tons of the\r\nweight of the cables vertically rest upon the platform, great steadiness\r\nis secured, inasmuch as the central part of the cables must partake of\r\nany movement of the platform, and their weight greatly increases the\r\ninertia to be overcome. In order still further to prevent oscillations\r\nas much as possible, a number of “guys” are attached to the bridge.\r\nThese are wire ropes of the same thickness as the suspenders, and they\r\nconnect the platform with various points of the bank—some going\r\nhorizontally to the summit of the cliffs, others vertically, but the\r\nmajority obliquely. There are twenty-eight guys on the side of the\r\nbridge next the falls, and twenty-six on the other side. The thickness\r\nof the wire rope of which they are made being little more than ½ in.,\r\nthey are scarcely visible, or rather appear like spider lines. About 400\r\nft. of the length of the bridge in the centre is without either guys or\r\nstays except two small steel ropes, which, tightly strained from cliff\r\nto cliff, cross each other nearly at right angles at the centre of the\r\nbridge. The suspension towers are pyramidal in form and are built of\r\nwhite pine, the timbers being a foot square in section and very solidly\r\nput together, so that they are capable of bearing forty times the load\r\nwhich can ever be put upon them. The towers are surmounted by strong\r\nframes of cast iron, to which are fixed the rollers carrying the cables\r\nand stays to their anchorage. The weight of the bridge itself, together\r\nwith the greatest load it can be required to bear, amounts to 363 tons.\r\nIts cost was £22,000, and it was constructed without a single accident\r\nof any kind.\r\n\r\nThe foam of the great falls is carried by the stream beneath the bridge,\r\nand in sunshine the spectator who places himself on the centre of its\r\nplatform sees in the spray driven by the wind, not a mere fragment of a\r\nrainbow, or a semicircular arc, but the complete circle, half of which\r\nappears beneath his feet. The gorge of the Niagara is very liable to\r\nfurious blasts of winds, for by its conformation it seems to gather the\r\naërial currents into a focus, so that a gentle breeze passing over the\r\nsurrounding country is here converted into a strong gale, sweeping down\r\nwith great force between the precipitous banks of the river. Indeed, one\r\nwould suppose that the cavern from which Æolus allows the winds to rush\r\nout, must be situated near Niagara Falls. The bridge is not disturbed by\r\nordinary winds, although during its construction, before the stays and\r\nguys were fixed, it was subject to considerable displacement from this\r\ncause. The peculiar arrangement of the cables, by which they hang, not\r\nvertically, but widening out from the centre of the bridge, giving what\r\nhas been termed the “cradle” form, has proved of the highest advantage,\r\nso that, with the aid of the guys and stays, and the plan of attaching\r\nthe central part of the roadway to the cables, the bridge is believed to\r\nbe capable of withstanding without damage a gale having the force of 30\r\nlbs. per square foot, although its total pressure on the structure might\r\nthen amount to more than 100 tons. The stability of the structure was\r\nseverely tested soon after its erection by a furious gale from the\r\nsouth-west, by which the guys were severely strained; in fact, many of\r\nthem gave way. In one case an enormous block of stone, 32 tons in\r\nweight, to which one of the guys was moored, was dragged up and moved 10\r\nft. nearer the bridge. This and some lateral distortion of the platform,\r\nwhich was easily remedied, was all the damage sustained by the bridge.\r\nBy an increase of the strength of the guys, &c., and the addition of the\r\ntwo diagonal steel wire ropes mentioned above, the bridge was soon made\r\nstronger than before. Some years ago, when the Menai suspension bridge\r\nwas exposed to a storm of like severity, that structure suffered great\r\ndamage, the platform having been broken and some of it swept away. In\r\nthe great gale which swept down upon the Niagara bridge, although the\r\nforce of the wind was so great that passengers and carriages could not\r\nmake headway, the vertical oscillations of the bridge never exceeded 18\r\nin., an amount which must be considered extremely satisfactory in a\r\nbridge of the kind, having a span of nearly a quarter of a mile.[4]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the skill displayed in its construction, this bridge\r\n  has, since the above account was written, been destroyed by a\r\n  tremendous hurricane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147_b_.—_Living Model of the Cantilever Principle._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _CANTILEVER BRIDGES._\r\n\r\nThe great Forth Bridge, now (December, 1889) approaching completion, is\r\nthe first bridge on the cantilever and central girder principle that has\r\nbeen erected in Great Britain, and it has also the distinction of being\r\nby far the widest spanned bridge in all the world. We are told by the\r\nengineers of the bridge that the cantilever and girder principle is by\r\nno means new, for it has been adopted hundreds of years ago by\r\ncomparatively rude tribes in the construction of timber bridges, to\r\nwhich it readily lends itself. Such bridges are described as having been\r\nerected by the natives of Hindoostan, Canada, Thibet, etc., even at\r\nremote periods. The principle of the cantilever and girder construction\r\nwas well illustrated by Mr. Baker, one of the engineers of the bridge,\r\nat a lecture given by him at the Royal Institution, by means of what he\r\ntermed “a living model,” of which (Fig. 147_b_) shows the general\r\narrangement. Two men, seated on chairs, extend their arms and hold in\r\ntheir hands sticks, of which the other ends butt against the chairs. The\r\ncentral girder is represented by a shorter stick, suspended at _a_ and\r\n_b_. We have here the representation of two double cantilevers, the\r\nropes at _c_ and _d_, connected with the weights, representing the\r\nanchorages of the landward arms of the cantilevers. When a weight is\r\nplaced on _a b_, which was done in the “living model,” by a third man\r\nseating himself thereon, a tensile strain comes into action in the ropes\r\nand in the men’s arms, while the sticks abutting on the chairs have to\r\nresist a compressing force, and the weight of the whole is borne by the\r\nlegs of the chairs, also under compression. Now let the reader imagine\r\nthe men’s heads to be 360 feet above the ground, and about a third of a\r\nmile apart, while the distance between _a_ and _b_ is 350 feet, and he\r\nwill have a rough but sufficiently clear idea, not only of the principle\r\nupon which the Forth Bridge is constructed, but also of the magnitude of\r\none of its spans. To complete the comparison, Mr. Baker further invited\r\nhis hearers to suppose that the pull upon each arm of the men is equal\r\nto 10,000 tons, and that the legs of each chair press on the ground with\r\nthe weight of more than 100,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe Forth Bridge spans the estuary at Queensferry nine miles north-west\r\nfrom Edinburgh, and its purpose is to afford uninterrupted railway\r\ncommunication along the eastern side of Scotland. It will, in effect,\r\nshorten the railway journey between Edinburgh and Perth, or Aberdeen, by\r\nnearly two hours. Queensferry had long been established as a usual place\r\nfor crossing the Forth, and readers of Scott’s “Antiquary” will remember\r\nthat the first chapter describes how Monkbarns and Lovel, by some\r\naccidental delays to the coach, lost the tide, and had to wait, to sail\r\n“with the tide of ebb and the evening breeze,” finding themselves, in\r\nthe meanwhile, pretty comfortable over a good dinner at the “Hawes Inn.”\r\nThis inn still stands, its situation being close to the southern end of\r\nthe great bridge. A design for the erection of a light suspension bridge\r\nat the same spot was published at the beginning of the present century,\r\nbut although the spans were to be equal to those of the present bridge\r\n(17,000 feet), the different scale of the projects may be inferred from\r\nthe total weight of iron to be used being estimated at 200 tons, while\r\n50,000 tons will be required for the structure now approaching\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, an Act of Parliament was obtained authorizing the construction\r\nof a suspension bridge at Queensferry, to carry the railway over the\r\nestuary. The design comprised practically two bridges, each carrying a\r\nsingle line of rails, the bridges being braced together at intervals.\r\nThe central towers were to have been 600 feet high, or about 100 feet\r\nloftier than any other erection then existing in the world. The designer\r\nwas the late Sir Thomas Bouch, and preparations were made for carrying\r\nout the plans by the erection of workshops and the manufacture of bricks\r\nfor the piers. But the project was knocked on the head by the terrible\r\ndisaster at the Tay Bridge, in December, 1879, when several of the\r\ncentral piers were overturned by the force of the wind, with swift\r\ndestruction to a passing train, which was precipitated into the water,\r\nand every one of about ninety persons in the train perished. Sir Thomas\r\nBouch having been the designer of the Tay Bridge, public confidence in\r\nhis plan was shaken to such an extent, that the four railway companies\r\nwho were promoting the construction of the suspension bridge abandoned\r\nthe project in favour of a design on the cantilever and central girder\r\nsystem, which was then brought forward by Mr. (now Sir John) Fowler and\r\nMr. Baker. When the Bessemer process had made steel attainable at a\r\ncheap rate, these engineers recognized the advantages which cantilever\r\nbridges, made of that material, presented for the wide spans required\r\nfor carrying railways across navigable rivers, and in 1865 they had\r\ndesigned such a bridge, with 1,000 feet spans for a viaduct, across the\r\nSevern, near the position of the present tunnel. It was not, however,\r\nuntil 1881 that the designs for the Forth Bridge were published in\r\nEnglish and American engineering journals. These designs at once\r\nattracted attention, and scarcely a year had elapsed before a railway\r\nbridge was built for the Canadian and Pacific Railway, on the same\r\nprinciple, and this has been followed by others since. It is, however,\r\nabsurd to allege that the engineers took their ideas from America,\r\nmerely because these smaller undertakings have been completed before the\r\ngreat work that dwarfs them all was open for traffic. The construction\r\nof the Forth Bridge on its present design was commenced in January,\r\n1883. Its site at Queensferry is at a point where the estuary narrows,\r\nand where, in the very middle of the channel, there is a small rocky\r\nisland, called Inchgarvie, that furnishes a solid foundation for the\r\ngreat central pier. On each side of this island the channels are about\r\none-third of a mile wide, and more than 200 feet deep, and through them\r\nthe tide rushes with great velocity. The impossibility of building up\r\nany intermediate piers, under such circumstances, is sufficiently\r\nobvious—the currents must be crossed at one span, if a railway bridge\r\nhad to be made. The formation of the piers for such a work presented\r\nmany novel problems, and much of the work had to be commenced in deep\r\nwater; that is, the ground of rock or hard clay had to be prepared, in\r\nsome parts, as far as 90 feet below high water. Each pier stands on four\r\ncaissons, which are great tubes or drums of iron and steel, filled up\r\nwith concrete. Each weighed, when empty, about 400 tons, but when filled\r\nup with concrete, the weight would be about 3,000 tons. The diameter of\r\neach is 70 feet, and the deepest one is sunk 89 feet below the water,\r\nand it was with no little labour that some of them were put in their\r\nplaces. Each caisson has an outer and an inner tube, is 70 feet in\r\ndiameter at the base, and 60 feet at the top. Seven feet from the\r\nbottom, an air-tight partition formed a chamber in the lower part of the\r\ncaisson, about 70 feet in diameter, by 7 feet high, and shafts\r\nsufficiently large to admit the passage of men and tools led from the\r\ntop. Air was forced into this chamber, when the caisson had been sunk,\r\nexpelling the water, and then men descended through the shafts and\r\nlocks, in which a high pressure of air was also maintained, and\r\nexcavated the material at the bottom, until the caisson had, by its own\r\nweight, sunk to the depth required. The work in this air chamber was\r\ncarried on by means of electric lights, and ten or twelve weeks were\r\noccupied in sinking each caisson. The pressure of the air in the working\r\nchamber was sometimes as high as 35 pounds per square inch, or\r\nsufficient to maintain the mercurial column in a barometer 72 inches\r\nhigh, instead of the ordinary 29 or 30 inches. It was found that the\r\nlabour in the compressed air chamber could not be done by our home\r\nworkmen, as they were quite unaccustomed to the high air pressures\r\nrequired to keep out the water; but arrangements were made for the\r\nassistance of a staff of French workmen, inured to the conditions by\r\nlong working under water in the construction of the docks at Antwerp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n  THE FORTH BRIDGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe stores, offices and workshops, situated on a slight eminence near\r\nthe south end of the bridge, are very extensive, occupying, it is said,\r\nan area of 50 acres. Here are great furnaces, cranes and machinery for\r\nshaping and fitting the steel plates and bars ready for taking their\r\nappointed places in the vast structure. An hydraulic crane may, for\r\ninstance, be seen lifting a ton weight flat steel plate that has been\r\nheated to redness in a regenerative gas furnace, and transferring it to\r\nan hydraulic press, where it is quickly and quietly bent to the required\r\nshape. The plate is then cooled, and, when the edges have been planed,\r\nit is placed in position with the adjoining plates, and the rivet holes\r\nare drilled by an ingenious machine, specially designed by Mr. Arrol,\r\nthe contractor, for that purpose. It works upon 8–feet lengths of the\r\ntubes, and simultaneously cuts ten rivet holes at different points in\r\nthe circumference. All the different parts of the structure are\r\ntemporarily fitted together to ascertain that every piece is properly\r\nadjusted. They are then marked according to the position they are to\r\ntake, and are laid aside until they are wanted. Thus the work at the\r\nbridge has proceeded without any awkward hitches arising from ill\r\nadjusted sections being brought together. At times, 1,800 tons of\r\nfinished steel-work has been turned out of these shops in a month, and\r\nthis material, which was supplied by the Steel Company of Scotland, has\r\nbeen found thoroughly trustworthy in every respect. Its strength is\r\none-half greater than that of the best wrought-iron, and the plates have\r\nthrice the ductility of iron plates. The steel plates for the great\r\ntubes are supplied in lengths of 16 feet, and of different thicknesses,\r\nbetween ⅜ths of an inch and 1¼ inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147_c_.—_Principal Dimensions of the Forth Bridge._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sketch, Fig. 147 _c_, shows the general dimensions of the bridge\r\nproper, or that part of the viaduct which will actually span the\r\nestuary. Of the three great piers that support the cantilevers, it will\r\nbe observed that the central one, which rests on Inchgarvie, is wider\r\nthan the other two. Each consists mainly of four tubes, 12 feet in\r\ndiameter, made of plates of steel 1¼ inch in thickness, and these rise\r\nto the highest part of the bridge, which is 361 feet above the water, so\r\nthat the structure is as lofty as St. Paul’s Cathedral. These great\r\ntubes are not placed vertically, but incline inwards towards the top, so\r\nthat while the “straddle legs” of each pair are 120 feet apart at the\r\nbase, they are only 33 feet apart at the top. These lofty columns are\r\nalso braced together diagonally by other steel tubes—that is, a tube\r\npasses from the foot of every column to each of the other three. At the\r\nbase of each column, the lowest spanning member springs also (which\r\nappears like an arch, but is not so), as a tube of 12 feet diameter.\r\nThus abutting or resting on enormously thick plates of steel that cap\r\nthe masonry of each pier, are five tubular steel limbs, three of which\r\nare 12 feet in diameter, and two are 8 feet, and, besides these five,\r\ngirder members diverge from nearly the same centre. One of the large\r\ntubular members is the first strut that rises obliquely to support the\r\nupper structure. From the point where this strut meets the upper member,\r\na stay passes downwards with an opposite inclination to the lower\r\nmember, from its point of junction with which another strut rises, and\r\nso on. All the struts, as being subject to compressing force, are made\r\nof steel tubes; the straight upper members and the stays are lattice\r\nbraced girders of rectangular section. The apparent curve of the lower\r\nmember—for it is really made up of sections of straight tubes—may\r\nsuggest the notion of an arch; but the reader must remember that the\r\nprinciple of this bridge has no relation to that of the arch. The\r\ncantilevers do not unite the long arms they stretch, but each is an\r\nindependent structure with its own perfect stability, and it will not be\r\nclutched on or locked up to its neighbours by the central girders. The\r\nweight of one of these 1,700 feet spans is about 16,000 tons, and the\r\nheaviest train loads might be two coal trains, weighing together, say\r\n800 tons, or only one-twentieth of the dead weight of the structure.\r\nBut, what would not generally be supposed, the pressure of the wind is\r\nan element of much more importance in considering the stability of the\r\nbridge than the weight of the rolling load. It is to resist the wind\r\npressure that the lofty columns that are only 33 feet apart at the top\r\nacross the bridge, plant their bases 120 feet asunder. The estimated\r\nlateral pressure of the wind on one of the cantilevers, assuming it as\r\nequal to 56 lbs. per square foot, would amount to 2,000 tons. These\r\nstrains are so fully provided for that the engineers are confident that\r\na hurricane of such a force as would desolate the country would leave\r\nthe Forth Bridge intact, even if the wind blew in opposite directions on\r\nthe two arms of the cantilever. To rend asunder the top ties, a pull\r\nequivalent to the weight of 45,000 tons would be required, whilst the\r\nutmost strain that passing trains could possibly bring upon these ties\r\nwould be less than 2,000 tons. A striking illustration of the strength\r\nof these huge brackets was lately given by Mr. Baker himself, when in a\r\npublic lecture he assured his audience that half a dozen of our\r\nponderous modern ironclads might be hung from the cantilevers. Everyone\r\nknows that a bracket requires to be strongest nearest the base, and the\r\nlower steel arms that stretch out 680 feet each diminish in diameter\r\nuntil at the end it has decreased to five feet, and the pairs approach\r\neach until, from being 120 feet apart at the base, they are only 33 feet\r\napart at the ends. The central girders will each weigh about 1,000 tons,\r\nand only one end of each will be attached to a cantilever, the other\r\nends will simply rest on what are called “rocking columns,” so that\r\nthere may be freedom of motion to allow play for the changes of position\r\nthat will be induced by changes of temperature expanding or contracting\r\nthe huge masses of metal.\r\n\r\nThe reader can hardly have failed to observe that the chief element in\r\nthe stability of the structure depends upon balancing a great mass of\r\nmetal on the one side of a pier by an equal mass on the other side. But\r\nwhile each end of the central cantilever bears half the weight of a\r\ncentral girder, the two shoreward cantilevers have this load at their\r\ninner ends only. How is their balance maintained? In this way: the\r\nshoreward arms are made about 10 feet longer than those that stretch\r\nover the water and their extremities are also loaded with about 1,000\r\ntons of iron, built up within the shore piers.\r\n\r\nThe lofty columns of the piers were erected without any external\r\nstaging, from a temporary platform surrounding the piers and supporting\r\nthe necessary machinery. The weight of this platform with the machinery\r\non it was about 400 tons, and as the work proceeded it was raised as\r\nrequired by hydraulic machines placed within the vertical columns. As\r\nthe height of these increased, the men and materials had to be conveyed\r\nto the platform by cages moving between guide ropes and worked by steam\r\nengines. From this platform were constructed not only the main columns,\r\nbut the great diagonal tubes, the bracing girders, and the viaduct\r\ngirder. The cantilevers were also put together without scaffolding. When\r\nthe first few feet of the lower member had been built out from the base,\r\na movable platform was hung round it, and on this platform were the\r\ncranes for putting the plates into position, the furnace for heating the\r\nrivets, and the hydraulic riveter of specially designed construction,\r\nwithout noise or hammering, the riveting being completed by the\r\napplication of a pressure equal to 3 tons per square inch. The building\r\nup of the cantilever arms on either side of each pier always proceeded\r\nat the same rate, so that the balance was constantly maintained. This\r\nbuilding out from each side of the pier, without the necessity of\r\nrelying upon any temporary scaffolding from below, is one great\r\nadvantage of the cantilever system, as it is both easier and safer than\r\na system which relies upon the temporary scaffolding raised from below.\r\nThe Forth is for the time the longest spanned bridge in the world; but\r\nit may not retain that honour long, for the legislature of the United\r\nStates has already authorized the construction of a cantilever bridge,\r\nthe spans of which are to be 2,480 feet. Still more gigantic is the\r\nproject lately put forward by some competent French engineers of\r\nbridging the English Channel from Folkestone to Cape Grisnez in 70 spans\r\non the cantilever system. The designs have been completed and the\r\ncalculations made, and no one doubts of the engineering practicability\r\nof the scheme. But the cost is estimated at about 34 million pounds\r\nsterling, or nearly six times as much as that required for constructing\r\nthe proposed Channel Tunnel; so that the scale could be turned in favour\r\nof the bridge only if the political reasons that were opposed to the\r\ntunnel were held not to be applicable to the bridge. But it is difficult\r\nto conceive that the existing traffic could ever be developed to such an\r\nextent as to make an undertaking of this magnitude a commercial success.\r\n\r\nSince the above account was written, the Forth Bridge was formally\r\nopened on the 4th March, 1890, by the Prince of Wales, in the presence\r\nof a great gathering of railway directors, eminent engineers, and other\r\ndistinguished persons from all parts. A very strong gale was blowing at\r\nthe time, and at this very hour the bridge was therefore subjected to\r\nanother severe but undesigned test of its stability. The perfect\r\nsteadiness and security of the structure impressed all who were present\r\non that occasion, and the train crossed the bridge, exposed to a wind\r\npressure, registered by the gauge, of 25 lbs. per square foot. At the\r\nluncheon following the opening ceremony, the Prince announced that\r\nbaronetcies had been conferred upon Mr M. W. Thompson (the chairman of\r\nthe Bridge Company) and upon Sir John Fowler, and that Mr. Baker and Mr.\r\nArrol, the contractor for the works, were to be knighted. Sir John\r\nFowler, the engineer-in-chief, was born in 1817, and has been engaged in\r\nmany other important works of railway construction in Yorkshire, in that\r\nof the London and Brighton Railway, in the Sheffield Waterworks, &c. The\r\nMetropolitan Railway in London, which also was carried out by Sir John\r\nFowler, would alone suffice to make him famous as an engineer. Sir\r\nBenjamin Baker is a much younger man, who has had a large and varied\r\npractice in railway engineering in various parts of the world. He is in\r\nmuch request on the American continent, and is now engaged in carrying\r\nout a ship railway in Canada and a tunnel under the Hudson at New York.\r\nSir William Arrol began life at nine years of age as a “piecer” in a\r\ncotton mill, but was afterwards apprenticed as an engineer. Subsequently\r\nhe was employed as a foreman by engineering firms in Glasgow. In 1866,\r\nhe began business on his own account at Dalmarnock, and obtained\r\ncontracts at first for smaller then for larger works connected with\r\nbridge and viaduct building. He is distinguished for the energy and\r\ninventive resources he displays in carrying out his undertakings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _THE TOWER BRIDGE, LONDON._\r\n\r\nA little more than four years after the opening of the Forth Bridge, in\r\nJune 1894, another great enterprise which had been commenced eight years\r\nbefore, was inaugurated by the Prince and Princess of Wales as\r\nrepresentatives of Her Majesty the Queen. This was the Tower Bridge,\r\nwhich not only is one of the most important public works of the century,\r\nbut one that presents features of interest and novelty that have never\r\nbefore been combined in any single structure. The want of an adequate\r\ncommunication between the shores of the Thames eastward of London Bridge\r\nhad long been felt, and was for years a subject of serious consideration\r\nfor the Metropolitan authorities. The congested state of the traffic\r\nacross London Bridge has often furnished a spectacle for the sight-seer,\r\nand figures are not wanting to show that the number of foot-passengers\r\nalone who daily traverse that bridge, which altogether is only 54 feet\r\nwide, would be equal to the whole population of many considerable\r\ncities: for in 1882 a count showed the daily average of pedestrians to\r\nbe 110,525, while the number of vehicles was 22,242. There was much\r\ndifference of opinion as to the best method of providing the required\r\nmeans of communication; but there was an almost universal agreement as\r\nto its position being selected just eastward of the Tower of London. The\r\nmap of the districts connected by the Tower Bridge which is given in\r\nFig. 147_d_, will show a reader who has any acquaintance with London the\r\nsuitability of the site. The problem of traversing the river at this\r\npoint involved complex conditions as affecting the vehicular traffic and\r\nthe navigation, and many different schemes were proposed and examined,\r\ncomprised under the three heads of bridges, tunnels and ferries. But a\r\nferry is always an imperfect means of communication, liable to accidents\r\nand interruptions from fogs, and in severe weather from ice, rendering\r\nthe transit impossible for sometimes many days together. A tunnel\r\nbeneath the river would, of course, leave the navigation without\r\nimpediment, but among its special disadvantages are the great expense of\r\nconstruction and maintenance, for it has been found that tunnels beneath\r\nwaterways are very costly in both respects. Besides, there would have to\r\nbe long inclined approaches at each end, and the cost would be\r\nenormously increased by the amount of valuable land these would occupy.\r\nIt was indeed proposed that the tunnel should be provided instead with\r\nhydraulic lifts at each end, like those often found in connection with\r\nthe sub-ways at railway stations; but such would have to be of\r\nBrobdignagian dimensions, and would daily entail heavy expense. Then, as\r\nregards the bridges, schemes of various kinds were proposed, some even\r\nbridging the whole 850 feet width of the river at a single span, but all\r\ndistinguishable by these important characteristics: they either provided\r\na high level roadway which requires long inclines to reach it, but\r\npermitted lofty-masted ships to pass under it; or, on the other hand,\r\nthe roadway was to be made at a low level with a clear headway above the\r\nwater of moderate height. While avoiding the inclined approaches, this\r\nplan would either prevent fully rigged vessels passing to the wharves\r\nabove the bridge, or some part of the structure would have to open or\r\nswing aside, that the ships might pass through the opening, thus\r\ncompletely interrupting the pedestrian and vehicular traffic for the\r\ntime, with an amount of inconvenience that may be imagined when, as\r\noften happens, twenty large ships or more might pass in the course of a\r\nday, each causing a stoppage of five minutes in the road traffic. Nor\r\nwould it be without risks that large vessels could pass through a\r\ncomparatively narrow opening in a strong tide-way. Plans for sub-ways,\r\nfor high level roadways and for low level roadways, were examined by\r\nParliamentary Committees when powers to construct the works were\r\nsuccessively applied for by the Metropolitan authorities, and much\r\nvaluable evidence having been given, such objectionable features of each\r\nscheme as have been already referred to were duly noted. At length in\r\n1878, Mr. Horace Jones, the late architect to the City of London, in a\r\nreport on the various projects, suggested the general plan on which the\r\npresent bridge is built, and this having been approved of by the Common\r\nCouncil, steps were taken to obtain Parliamentary powers to raise the\r\nnecessary capital and to proceed with the works; but, for various\r\nreasons, it was not until 1885 that the Act authorising the undertaking\r\nwas passed. In the meantime Mr. John Wolfe Barry was appointed engineer\r\nof the structure, while Mr. Jones was to superintend the architectural\r\ndetails; but after having received the honour of knighthood in 1885, he\r\ndied in the same year; and Mr. Barry, reconsidering the joint design,\r\nintroduced some new features and somewhat modified the architectural\r\nexpression of the structure. One striking point of originality about the\r\nTower Bridge is that while it is essentially an iron and steel\r\nconstruction as much as the Forth Bridge, the heavy stiff metal-work is\r\nencased in masonry of elegant and appropriate architectural design, by\r\nwhich the general desire that the bridge should harmonize so far as\r\nmight be, with the ancient historical fortress it adjoins, has been\r\nhappily realised. Then again, by the ingenious engineering, the public\r\nhave the advantage of a low level roadway, while the largest vessels may\r\npass freely through a wide space without risk. These apparently\r\nincompatible advantages have been obtained by the adoption of what is\r\nthe _bascule_ principle on a hitherto unattempted scale. _Bascule_ is a\r\nFrench engineering term, which is probably less familiar to most of our\r\nreaders than the thing itself. It is applied to the platform of a\r\ndraw-bridge which turns as the lid of a box does on its hinges, to\r\nafford a passage over the stream or moat when it is horizontal, and when\r\ndrawn up vertically denies such passage. Smaller _bascule_ bridges on\r\nexactly the same plan as in the Tower Bridge may often be seen in places\r\nhaving docks or canals, such as Hull, &c. In these a flap or platform is\r\nlet down from each side from the vertical position, in which the\r\nwater-way is open until the free edges meet together to form the\r\nroadway. These platforms turn on horizontal pivots, and are\r\ncounterpoised by loads of stone or metal, so that they are without\r\ndifficulty raised and lowered by a winch or handle that turns a cogged\r\npinion engaging the teeth of a large quadrant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\n  THE TOWER BRIDGE IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “THE ENGINEER”      SWAIN ENG.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147_d_.—_Map of the Tower Bridge and its Approaches._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe following general description of the Tower Bridge is mainly\r\nabstracted from a very full and excellent account of it drawn up in 1894\r\nby Mr. J. E. Tuit, engineer to Sir W. Arrol & Co., the contractors, in\r\nwhich are embraced the whole of the technical details of the structure.\r\nThe map, Fig. 147_d_, shows the site of the bridge and its approaches,\r\nof which the northern one begins close to the mint and passes along the\r\neast side of the Tower of London to the northern abutment. This approach\r\nis formed of a series of brick arches, and is nearly 1,000 feet long and\r\n35 feet wide in the roadway, with a footpath 12½ feet wide on either\r\nside of it. The incline is only a rise of 1 in 60, but the southern\r\napproach is slightly steeper, namely, 1 in 40 leaving the street level\r\nat Tooley Street. At each abutment there are also stairs connecting the\r\nbanks of the river with the roadway of the bridge. The width of the\r\nriver between the two abutments is 880 feet, and this is divided, as\r\nshown in Fig. 147_e_, into two side spans, each 270 feet wide, and one\r\ncentral span of 200 feet clear, making together 740 feet, the river\r\npiers, each of which is 70 feet wide, completing the total span. The\r\nclear headway above high water, when the _bascules_ or leaves are down,\r\nis, in the middle span, 29½ feet in the centre, but only 15 feet at the\r\nends; but when the leaves are raised for ships to pass, it is about 143\r\nfeet. The headway at the shore sides of the piers is 27 feet, but this\r\nis lessened to 23 feet and 20 feet at the north and south abutments\r\nrespectively. The roadway and footpaths are continued along the side\r\nspans of the same width as on the approaches, but over the central span\r\nthe road is 32 feet, and each footway 8½ feet wide. The river piers are\r\nsaid to be the largest in the world of the same kind, and their great\r\narea was necessitated by the nature of the London clay on which they\r\nrest, which was found incapable of bearing a load much exceeding four\r\ntons per square foot without some risk of undue settlement.\r\n\r\nThe part of the piers below the bed of the river is formed of concrete,\r\nwhile the upper part is brickwork, set in cement and faced with Cornish\r\ngranite. Upon each of the river piers rest four octagonal columns, built\r\nup of flat steel plates, connected together at their edges by splayed\r\nangle-bars. The columns are 120 feet high, and 5½ feet in diameter;\r\nthose on each pier are securely braced together, at certain stages also\r\nby plate girders, 6 feet deep, to form a floor or landing, and the tops\r\nof the columns are similarly joined together. At the height of 143 feet\r\nabove high water there are two footways, each 12 feet wide and 230 feet\r\nlong, carried on girders over the central span, and supported by the\r\ncolumns on each pier. It must be noted that all the roadway, and, in\r\nfact, all the practical and useful structure of the bridge, depend upon\r\nthe steel-work alone, which is supported mainly by the eight octagonal\r\ncolumns just mentioned. The architectural features, which so\r\nappropriately clothe all the steel columns, are added for æsthetic\r\nconsiderations, and their masonry takes no part in bearing the weights\r\nand strains of the structure. Indeed, the stone-work of the towers is\r\ncarefully separated from the columns, which were covered with canvas\r\nwhile the masonry was built round them, and spaces were left at every\r\npoint where compression of the steel-work would bring weight upon the\r\nstone-work. This investment of the metal-work by beautiful architecture\r\nis, as already mentioned, one of the most original features of the Tower\r\nBridge. The view of the work in progress, as given in Plate VIII., which\r\nis one of the many beautiful illustrations in Mr. Tuit’s book, will give\r\nthe reader an opportunity of judging how much the structure gains in\r\nsightliness by the addition of the architectural features. Two hydraulic\r\nlifts are placed in each tower to convey pedestrians to and from the\r\nhigher level footways, when the moving parts of the bridge are open, and\r\nstairs also are provided for the same purpose for those who prefer them\r\nto using the lifts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147_e._—_The Tower Bridge._\r\n]\r\n\r\n Length of Bridge with its approaches                         2680 feet.\r\n\r\n Length of Northern approach                                  1000 feet.\r\n\r\n Length of Southern approach                                   800 feet.\r\n\r\n Width between N. and S. abutments                             830 feet.\r\n\r\n Width of central span                                         200 feet.\r\n\r\n Width of side spans, each                                     270 feet.\r\n\r\n Depth of River at high water under central span               33½ feet.\r\n\r\n Depth of River at lowest tides under central span              12 feet.\r\n\r\n Clear headway at high water when the leaves are down (varies 20 to 29½\r\n   from one part of the bridge to another)                    feet.\r\n\r\n Clear headway in centre span at high water with the leaves    143 feet.\r\n   raised\r\n\r\nThe side spans are really suspension bridges, but the chains have only\r\ntwo links, connected at the lowest point by a pin 2½ feet in diameter,\r\nwhile their higher ends are supported on the columns of the piers, and\r\non similar but shorter columns on the abutments. The horizontal pulls of\r\nthe chains on the piers are made to balance each other by connecting the\r\nchains to tie bars stretching across the central span, and the landward\r\nends of the chains, after passing over the lower columns of the\r\nabutments, are securely anchored in enormous masses of concrete.\r\n\r\nEach of the opening parts, or _bascules_, or leaves, as they may be\r\ncalled, consists of four girders 18½ feet apart, rigidly braced\r\ntogether, and connected at the pier end with a great shaft, 48 feet long\r\nand 1 foot 9 inches in diameter, which turns in massive bearings,\r\nresting upon four fixed girders. The leaf is counterbalanced on the\r\nshore side of the pivot shaft by 350 tons of lead and iron; the short\r\nleverage of the centre-weight and small space available for it required\r\nthe greater part of this weight to be of lead, rather than of the less\r\nexpensive metal. The pivot shaft passes through the centre of gravity of\r\nthe whole, so that, although the total weight is nearly 1,200 tons, no\r\nvery great power is required to set it in motion, as the pivot shaft\r\nrests on rollers to diminish the friction. The power for moving the leaf\r\nis applied to toothed quadrants of 42 feet radius, of which two are\r\nfixed to the outside girders of each leaf, and are geared into cogs\r\nmoved by eight large hydraulic engines, with six accumulators, into\r\nwhich water is pumped by two engines, each of 360 horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe total length of the bridge, including the approaches, is just half a\r\nmile, and the height of the towers from the foundations is 293 feet, so\r\nthat if one of them were placed beside St. Paul’s Cathedral, it would\r\ncompare with it in height as shown in the sketch, Fig. 147_f_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147_f_.—_Sketch._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _THE GREAT BROOKLYN BRIDGE._\r\n\r\nThe Clifton Bridge at Niagara Falls, which for a time had the\r\ndistinction of being the longest in span of any suspension bridge in the\r\nworld, has been fully described in previous pages; but more recently\r\nthis bridge has been surpassed in span, and in all other respects, by a\r\nstructure that immediately connects two of the most populous localities\r\nin the United States of America. The Island of Manhattan, which is\r\noccupied by the city of New York proper, has a population of nearly two\r\nmillions, and a strait on its eastern side, connecting Long Island Sound\r\nwith New York Harbour, alone divides it from the other great seats of\r\npopulation, called respectively Long Island City and Brooklyn. This\r\nchannel is about ten miles long, and of a varying width, which may\r\naverage three-quarters of a mile. There are many ferries between the\r\nopposite shores, and the waters are busy with steamers, sailing-boats,\r\ntugs, and craft of all kinds, engaged either in traffic with ports near\r\nat hand, or in trade with distant lands. At the southern end of this\r\nstrait, near the point of its junction with New York Bay, is the\r\nnarrowest part of its course, and it is here that it is crossed by the\r\nmagnificent suspension bridge, known indifferently as the East River\r\nBridge, or Brooklyn Bridge, which provides land communication between\r\nNew York, with its population of two millions, and Brooklyn, the fourth\r\ncity of the States in point of size, with inhabitants numbering about\r\none million. Brooklyn is largely a residential place for persons whose\r\ndaily business is in New York. It has wide, well-planned streets, many\r\nshaded by the luxuriant foliage of double rows of trees, and possesses\r\nparks, public buildings, institutes, churches, etc., on a scale\r\ncommensurate with its importance.\r\n\r\nThe central span of Brooklyn Bridge, from tower to tower, is 1,595 feet,\r\nand each shore part, extending from the tower to the anchorage of the\r\ncables, is 930 feet span, while the two approaches beyond the anchorage\r\ntogether add 2,534 feet to the total length, which is 5,989 feet, or\r\nconsiderably over a mile. The centre span, it will be observed, is much\r\ngreater than that of the Niagara Falls Clifton Bridge, which was less\r\nthan one quarter of a mile, whereas the Brooklyn Bridge span extends to\r\nsomething approaching one-third of a mile, or, more exactly, a few yards\r\nlonger than three-tenths. The width of the Brooklyn is another one of\r\nits remarkable features, for this is no less than 85 feet, and includes\r\ntwo roadways for ordinary vehicles, and two tramway tracks, on which the\r\ncarriages are moved by an endless cable, worked by a stationary engine\r\non the Brooklyn side. There is also a footpath, 13 feet wide, for\r\npedestrians. In this structure, as in many other suspension bridges,\r\nadvantage has been taken of the great tenacity of steel wire as compared\r\nwith iron bars. But here the wires are not twisted in strands like\r\nropes, but are laid straight together, and bound into a cylindrical\r\nform, each wire being 3,572 feet long, and extending from end to end of\r\nthe cables, which are four in number, each calculated to bear a strain\r\nof 12,200 tons. The number of wires in each cable is very great, for\r\ninstead of about the thousand of which the stranded wire cables usually\r\nconsist, there are 5,296 steel wires wrapped closely round, and forming\r\na cylinder 15¾ inches in diameter. Each wire is galvanised, that is,\r\ncoated with zinc, and then coated with oil. The towers over which the\r\ncables pass are of masonry, and rise to 272 feet above high-water; their\r\ndimensions at the water level are 140 feet by 50 feet, which offsets\r\ndiminish until at the top they are 120 feet by 40 feet. At the anchor\r\nstructures, the cables enter the masonry at nearly 80 feet above\r\nhigh-water, and pass 28 feet into the stonework for connection with the\r\nanchor chains. The anchorages are masses of masonry, measuring at the\r\nbase 129 feet by 119 feet, and at the top 117 feet by 104 feet, with a\r\nheight of 89 feet in front and 85 feet in the rear. The weight of each\r\nanchor-plate is 23 tons. The roadway of the bridge is suspended from the\r\ncables above the buildings and streets between the towers and the\r\nanchorages. The approaches, on the Brooklyn side 971 feet, on the New\r\nYork side 1,563 feet, are carried on stonework arches, which are\r\nutilised as warehouses, but where these approaches cross streets, iron\r\nbridges are thrown over. The clear headway between the centre of the\r\nroadway over the river at high-water is 135 feet, so that there is no\r\nobstruction to navigation, and the headway at the towers is 119 feet, so\r\nthat the roadway rises towards the centre about 3 feet 3 inches in 100\r\nfeet. The two towers comprise more than 85,000 cubic yards of masonry,\r\nand for various purposes 13,670 tons of concrete were used. The work was\r\ncommenced in January, 1870, and the first wire was carried across on\r\n29th May, 1877. The bridge was opened to the public on the 24th of May,\r\n1883, and the tramway four months later. The bridge was made free for\r\npedestrians in 1891, and in 1894 the tram-car fares were reduced to five\r\ncents (2½_d._) for two journeys. In that year, 41,927,122 passengers\r\nwere carried on the cars. The average number of persons daily crossing\r\nthe bridge is estimated at about 115,000, although on one day (11th\r\nFeb., 1895) as many as 225,645 passengers have been carried on the cars.\r\nThe cost of the work connected with this great bridge was $15,000,000\r\n(£3,125,000).\r\n\r\nIn relation to the subject of wide-spanning bridges, the erection has\r\nbeen contemplated of structures which would surpass in magnitude and\r\nboldness any of those yet named. Thus, in 1894, the New York Chamber of\r\nCommerce proposed to throw across the River Hudson, which washes the\r\nwestern side of New York, a bridge with a clear span of 3,200 feet\r\n(six-tenths of a mile), and 500 feet clear height; and the project was\r\ndeclared by an eminent and experienced engineer to be quite feasible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XV.\r\n\r\n  THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 148.—_Newspaper Printing-Room, with Walter Machines._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PRINTING MACHINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA volume might be filled with descriptions of the machines which in\r\nevery department of industry have taken the place of slow and laborious\r\nmanual labour. But if even we selected only such machines as from the\r\nbeautiful mechanical principles involved in their action, or from their\r\neffects in cheapening for everybody the necessaries and comforts of\r\nlife, might be considered of universal interest, the limits of the space\r\nwe can afford for this class of inventions would be far exceeded. The\r\nmachines for spinning, for weaving fabrics, for preparing articles of\r\nfood, are in themselves worthy of attention; then there is a little\r\nmachine which in almost every household has superseded one of the most\r\nprimitive kinds of hand-work, and that is the sewing machine. But all\r\nthese we must pass over, and confine our descriptions of special\r\nmachines to a class in which the interest is of a still more general and\r\nhigher character, since their effect in promoting the intellectual\r\nprogress of mankind is universally acknowledged. We need hardly say that\r\nwe allude to Printing Presses, and if we add a few lines on printing\r\nmachines other than those which have given us cheap literature, it is\r\nbecause these other machines also have contributed to the general\r\nculture by giving us cheap decorative art, and in their general\r\nprinciples they are so much akin to the former that but little\r\nadditional description is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _LETTERPRESS PRINTING._\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the youthful assistants of printers came to receive\r\ntheir technical appellation of “devils” has been the subject of many\r\ningenious explanations. One of these is to the effect that the earlier\r\nproductions of the press, having imitated the manuscript characters, the\r\nuninitiated supposed the impressions were produced by hand-copying, and\r\nin consequence of their rapid production and exact conformity with each\r\nother, it was thought that some diabolical agency must have been\r\ninvoked. Another story relates that one of Caxton’s first assistants was\r\na negro boy, who of course soon became identified in the popular mind\r\nwith an imp from the nether world. A very innocent explanation is put\r\nforward in another tale, relating that one of the first English printers\r\nhad in his employment a boy of the name of De Ville, or Deville, which\r\nname was soon corrupted into the now familiar title, and became the\r\ninheritance of this youth’s successors in the craft. Perhaps a more\r\nprobable and natural explanation might be found in the personal\r\nappearance which the apprentices must have presented, with hands, and no\r\ndoubt faces also, smeared over with the black ink which it was their\r\nduty to manipulate. For the ink was formerly always laid upon large\r\nround pads or balls of leather, stuffed with wool. When these balls,\r\nFig. 149, which were, perhaps, about 12 in. in diameter, had received a\r\ncharge of ink, the apprentice dabbed the one against the other, working\r\nthem with a twisting motion, and after having obtained a uniform\r\ndistribution of the ink on their surfaces with many dexterous\r\nflourishes, he applied them to the face of the types with both hands,\r\nuntil all the letters were completely and evenly charged. The operation\r\nwas very troublesome, and much practice was required before the\r\nnecessary skill was obtained, while it was always a most difficult\r\nmatter to keep the balls in good working condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 149.—_Inking Balls._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 150.—_Inking Roller._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first important step towards the possibility of a printing machine\r\nwas made, when for these inking balls was substituted a cylindrical\r\nroller, mounted on handles, Fig. 150. The body of the roller is of wood,\r\nbut it is thickly coated with a composition which unites the qualities\r\nof elasticity, softness, and readiness to take up the ink and distribute\r\nit evenly over the types. The materials used for this composition are\r\nchiefly glue and treacle, and sometimes also tar, isinglass, or other\r\nsubstances. Glycerine and various other materials have also been\r\nproposed as suitable ingredients for these composition rollers, but it\r\nis doubtful whether the original compound is not as efficacious as any\r\nyet tried. The composition is not unlike india-rubber in its appearance\r\nand some of its properties. Fig. 150 represents equally the mode in\r\nwhich the roller is applied to the type in hand presses, and that in\r\nwhich it is charged with ink, by being moved backwards and forwards over\r\na smooth table upon which the ink has been spread.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the first appearance of printing presses in Europe down\r\nto almost the beginning of the present century, a period of 350 years,\r\nno improvement in the construction appears to have been attempted. They\r\nwere simply wooden presses with screws, on exactly the same plan as the\r\ncheese-presses of the period. Earl Stanhope first, in 1798, made a press\r\nentirely of iron, and he provided it with an excellent combination of\r\nlevers, so that the “platen,” or flat plate which overlies the paper and\r\nreceives the pressure, is forced down with great power just when the\r\npaper comes in contact with the types. Such presses are capable of\r\nturning out about 250 impressions per hour, and it should be noted that\r\nthe very finest book printing is still done by presses upon this\r\nprinciple. One reason is that in such cases, where it is desired to\r\nprint with the greatest clearness and depth of colour, the ink employed\r\nis much thicker, or stiffer, and requires more thorough distribution and\r\napplication to the type than a machine can effect. Stanhope’s press was\r\nnot of a kind to meet the desire for rapid production, to which the\r\nincreasing importance of newspapers gave rise. The first practical\r\nsuccess in this direction was achieved by König, who, in 1814, set up\r\nfor Mr. Walter, the proprietor of the “Times,” two machines, by which\r\nthat newspaper was printed at the rate of 1,100 impressions per hour,\r\nthe machinery being driven by steam power.\r\n\r\nThe “Times” of the 28th November, 1814, in the following words made its\r\nreaders acquainted with the fact that they had in their hands for the\r\nfirst time a newspaper printed by steam power:\r\n\r\n“Our journal of this day presents to the public the practical result of\r\nthe greatest improvement connected with printing since the discovery of\r\nthe art itself. The reader of this paragraph now holds in his hand one\r\nof many thousand impressions of ‘The Times’ newspaper, which were taken\r\noff by a mechanical apparatus. A system of machinery almost organic has\r\nbeen devised and arranged, which, while it relieves the human frame of\r\nits most laborious efforts in printing, far exceeds all human powers in\r\nrapidity and dispatch. That the magnitude of the invention may be justly\r\nappreciated by its effects, we shall inform the public that after the\r\nletters are placed by the compositors, and enclosed in what is called\r\nthe ‘form,’ little more remains for man to do than to attend upon and\r\nwatch this unconscious agent in its operations. The machine is then\r\nmerely supplied with paper, itself places the form, inks it, adjusts the\r\npaper to the form newly inked, stamps the sheet, and gives it forth to\r\nthe hands of the attendant, at the same time withdrawing the form for a\r\nfresh coat of ink, which itself again distributes, to meet the ensuing\r\nsheet now advancing for impression, and the whole of these complicated\r\nacts is performed with such a velocity and simultaneousness of movement\r\nthat no less than 1,100 sheets are impressed in one hour. That the\r\ncompletion of an invention of this kind, not the effect of chance, but\r\nthe result of mechanical combinations, methodically arranged in the mind\r\nof the artist, should be attended with many obstructions and much delay\r\nmay be readily admitted. Our share in this event has, indeed, only been\r\nthe application of the discovery, under an agreement with the patentees,\r\nto our own particular business; yet few can conceive, even with this\r\nlimited interest, the various disappointments and deep anxiety to which\r\nwe have for a long course of time been subjected. Of the person who made\r\nthe discovery we have little to add. Sir Christopher Wren’s noblest\r\nmonument is to be found in the building which he erected: so is the best\r\ntribute of praise which we are capable of offering to the inventor of\r\nthe printing machine comprised in the preceding description, which we\r\nhave feebly sketched, of the powers and utility of his invention. It\r\nmust suffice to say further, that he is a Saxon by birth, that his name\r\nis König, and that the invention has been executed under the direction\r\nof his friend and countryman, Bauer.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 151.—_Diagram of Cowper and Applegath’s Single Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nEach of the machines erected by König for the “Times” printed only one\r\nside of the sheet, so that when they had been half printed by one\r\nmachine, they had then to be passed through the other, in order to be\r\n“perfected,” as it is technically termed. These machines were greatly\r\nimproved by Messrs. Applegath and Cowper, who contrived also a\r\nmodification by which the sheets could be perfected in one and the same\r\nmachine. As the principle of these machines has been followed, with more\r\nor less diversity of detail, in most of the printing machines at present\r\nin use, it is very desirable to lay that principle clearly before the\r\nreader. The diagram, Fig. 151, will make the action of Applegath and\r\nCowper’s single-printing machine easily understood. The type is set up\r\non a flat form, A B, which occupies part of the horizontal table, C D,\r\nthe rest of which, A C, is the inking table. E is a large cylinder,\r\ncovered with woollen cloth, which forms the “blanket.” The paper passes\r\nround this cylinder, and it is pressed against the form. The small black\r\ncircles, _f_, _g_, _h_, _k_, _l_, _m_, _n_, represent the rollers for\r\ndistributing the ink. _f_ is called the _ductor_ roller. This roller,\r\nwhich revolves slowly, is made of metal, and parallel to it is a plate\r\nof metal, having a perfectly straight edge, nearly, but not quite,\r\ntouching the cylinder, and at the other side, as well as at the\r\nextremities, bent upwards, so as to form a kind of trough, to contain\r\nthe ink, as a reservoir. The slow rotation of the ductor conveys the ink\r\nto the next roller, which is covered with composition, and being made to\r\nmove backwards and forwards between the ductor roller and the table at\r\ncertain intervals, it is termed the _vibrating_ roller. The ink having\r\nthus reached the inking-table, is spread evenly thereon by the\r\n_distributing rollers_, _h_, _k_, and it is taken up from the inking\r\ntable, as the latter passes under, by the _inking_ rollers, _l_, _m_,\r\n_n_. The table, C D, as a whole is constantly moving right and left in a\r\nhorizontal direction, so that the form passes alternately under the\r\nimpression cylinder, E, and the inking rollers, _l_, _m_, _n_. The axles\r\nof the inking and distributing rollers are made long and slender, and\r\ninstead of turning in fixed bearings, they rest in slots or notches, in\r\norder that, as the form passes below them, they may be raised, so that\r\nthey rest on the inking slab, and on the types, only by their own\r\nweight. They are placed not quite at right angles to the direction of\r\nthe table, but a little diagonally. The sliding motion caused by this,\r\nhelps very much in the uniform spreading of the ink. By these\r\narrangements the form is evenly smeared with ink, since each inking\r\nroller passes over it _twice_ before it returns to meet the paper under\r\nE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 152.—_Diagram of Applegath and Cowper’s Perfecting Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 153.—_Cowper’s Double Cylinder Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 152 is a similar diagram, to show the action of the double or\r\nperfecting printing machine, in which the sheets are printed on both\r\nsides. It will be observed that the general arrangement of impression\r\ncylinder, rollers, &c., is represented in duplicate, but reversed in\r\ndirection. There are also two cylinders, B B, the purpose of which, as\r\nmay be gathered from an inspection of the diagram, is to reverse the\r\nsheets of paper, so that after one side has been printed under the\r\ncylinder, E´, the blank surface may be turned downward, ready to receive\r\nthe impression from the form, A B. Fig. 153 gives a view of the Cowper\r\nand Applegath double machine, as actually constructed. The man standing\r\nup is called the _feeder_ or _layer-on_. He pushes the sheets forward,\r\none by one, towards the tapes, which carry them down the farther side of\r\nthe more distant cylinder, under which they pass, receiving the\r\nimpression; and so on in the manner already indicated in the diagram,\r\nFig. 152, until finally they reach a point where, released by the\r\nseparation of the two sets of tapes, they are received by the\r\n_taker-off_ (the boy who is represented seated on the stool), and are\r\nplaced by him on a table. The bed or table which carries the form moves\r\nalternately right and left, impelled by a pinion acting in a rack\r\nbeneath it, in such a manner that the direction of the table’s motion is\r\nchanged at the proper moment, while the driving pulley continues to\r\nrevolve always in the same direction. The movements of the table and of\r\nthe cylinders are performed in exact harmony with each other, for these\r\npieces are so connected by trains of wheels and rack-work that the\r\nsheets of paper may always receive the impression in the proper position\r\nas regards the margins, and therefore, when the sheets are printed on\r\nboth sides, the impressions will be exactly opposite to each other. This\r\ngives what is technically called “true register,” and as this cannot be\r\nsecured unless the paper travels over both cylinders at precisely the\r\nsame rate, these are finished with great care by turning their surfaces\r\nin a lathe to exactly the same diameter. The action of the machine will\r\nnot be fully understood without a glance at the arrangement of the\r\nendless tapes which carry the paper on its journey. The course of these\r\nmay be followed in Fig. 154, and a simple inspection of the diagram will\r\nrender a tedious description unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 154.—_Tapes of Cowper’s Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 155 we have a representation of a steam-power printing machine,\r\nsuch as is now very largely used for the ordinary printing of books,\r\nnewspapers of moderate circulation, hand-bills, &c., and in all the\r\nordinary work of the printing press. In this the table on which the form\r\nis placed has a reciprocating motion, but the large cylinder moves\r\ncontinuously always in the same direction. The feeder, or layer-on,\r\nplaces the sheet of paper against certain stops, and at the right moment\r\nthe sheet is nipped by small steel fingers, and carried forwards to the\r\ncylinder, which brings it into contact with the inked type. This is done\r\nwith much accuracy of register, for the impression cylinders gear in\r\nsuch a manner with the rest of the parts that their revolutions are\r\nsynchronous. This is a perfecting machine, for the paper, after having\r\nreceived the impression on one side, is carried by tapes round the other\r\ncylinder, where it receives the impression on the other side, “set-off\r\nsheets” being passed through the press at the same time. The axles of\r\nthe impression cylinders are mounted at the ends of short rocking beams,\r\nby small oscillations of which the cylinders are alternately brought\r\ndown upon, or lifted off, the form passing below them. A machine of this\r\nkind can print 900 impressions per hour, even of good bookwork, and for\r\nnewspaper or other printing, where less accuracy and finish are\r\nrequired, it may be driven at such a rate as to produce 1,400 perfected\r\nimpressions per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 155.—_Messrs. Hopkinson and Cope’s Perfecting Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe machines used for lithographic printing by steam power are almost\r\nidentical in their general arrangement with that just described, which\r\nmay be taken as a representative specimen of the modern printing\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nTo such machines as those already described the world is indebted for\r\ncheap books, cheap newspapers, and cheap literature in general. But\r\nwhen, with railways and telegraphs, came the desire for the very latest\r\nintelligence, the necessities of the newspaper press, as regards\r\nrapidity of printing, soon required a greater speed than could possibly\r\nbe attained by any of the flat form presses; for in these the table,\r\nwith the forms placed upon it, is unavoidably of a considerable weight,\r\nand this heavy mass has to be set in motion, stopped, moved in the\r\nopposite direction, and again stopped during the printing of each sheet.\r\nThe shocks and strains which the machine receives in these alternate\r\nreversals of the direction of the movement impose a limit beyond which\r\nthe speed cannot be advantageously increased. When Mr. Applegath was\r\nagain applied to by the proprietors of the “Times” to produce a machine\r\ncapable of working off a still larger number of impressions, he decided\r\nupon abandoning the plan of reciprocating movement, and substituting a\r\ncontinuous rotary movement of the type form. And he successfully\r\novercame the difficulties of attaching ordinary type to a cylindrical\r\nsurface. The idea of placing the type on a rotating cylinder is due to\r\nNicholson, who long ago proposed to give the types a wedge shape, so\r\nthat the pieces of metal would, like the stones of an arch, exactly fit\r\nround the cylindrical surface. The wedge-shaped types were, however, so\r\nliable to be thrown from their places by the centrifugal force, that\r\nNicholson proposed also certain mechanical methods of locking the types\r\ntogether after they had been placed on the circumference of the drum.\r\nThe plan he suggested for this purpose involved, however, such an\r\nexpenditure of time and trouble that his idea was never carried into\r\npractice. Mr. Applegath used type of the ordinary kind, which was set up\r\non flat surfaces, forming the sides of a prism corresponding to the\r\ncircumference of his revolving type cylinder, which was very large and\r\nplaced vertically. The flat surfaces which received the type were the\r\nwidth of the columns of the newspaper, and the type forms were firmly\r\nlocked up by screwing down wedge-shaped rules between the columns at the\r\nangles of the polygon. These form the “column rules,” which make the\r\nupright lines between the columns of the page, and by their shape they\r\nserved to securely fix the type in its place. The diameter of the\r\ncylinder to which the form was thus attached was 5 ft. 6 in., but the\r\ntype occupied only a portion of its circumference, the remainder serving\r\nas an inking table. Round the great cylinder eight impression rollers\r\nwere placed, and to each impression roller was a set of inking rollers.\r\nAt each turn, therefore, of the great cylinder eight sheets received the\r\nimpression. These cylinders were, as already stated, placed vertically,\r\nand, as it was necessary to supply the sheets from horizontal tables, an\r\ningenious arrangement of tapes and rollers was contrived, by which each\r\nsheet was first carried down from the table into a vertical position,\r\nwith its plane directed towards the impression roller, in which position\r\nit was stopped for an instant, then moved horizontally forwards round\r\nthe impression cylinder, and was finally brought out, suspended\r\nvertically, ready for a taker-off to place on his pile. This machine\r\ngave excellent results as to speed and regularity. From 10,000 to 12,000\r\nimpressions could be worked off in an hour, and the advantage was\r\nclaimed for it of keeping the type much cleaner, by reason of its\r\nvertical position. The power of this machine may be judged of from one\r\nactual instance. It is stated that of copies of the “Times” in which the\r\ndeath of the Duke of Wellington was announced, 14th November, 1852, no\r\nless than 70,000 were printed in one day, and the machines were not once\r\nstopped, either to wash the rollers or to brush the forms. It may be\r\nmentioned, in order to give a better idea of the magnitude of the\r\noperation of printing this one newspaper, that one average day’s copies\r\nweigh about ten tons, and that the paper for the week’s consumption\r\nfills a train of twenty waggons.\r\n\r\nAt the “Times” office and elsewhere, the vertical machine has some years\r\nago been superseded by others with horizontal cylinders. The fastest,\r\nperhaps, of all these printing machines is that which is now known as\r\nthe “Walter Press,” so called either because its principle was suggested\r\nby the proprietor of the “Times,” or merely out of compliment to him.\r\nThe improvements which are embodied in the Walter Press have been the\r\nsubject of several patents taken out in the names of Messrs. MacDonald\r\nand Calverley, and it is to these improvements that we must now direct\r\nthe attention of the reader. But we must premise that such machines as\r\nthe Walter Press became possible only by the discovery of the means of\r\nrapidly producing what is called a stereotype plate from a form of type.\r\nA full account of the methods of effecting this is reserved for a\r\nsubsequent article, but here it may suffice to say, that when a thick\r\nlayer of moist cardboard, or rather a number of sheets of thin unsized\r\npaper pasted together and still quite moist, is forced down upon the\r\nform by powerful pressure, a sharp even mould of the type is obtained,\r\nevery projection in the latter producing a corresponding depression in\r\nthe _papier maché_ mould. When the paper mould is dry, it may be used\r\nfor forming a _cast_ by pouring over it some fusible metallic alloy,\r\nhaving the properties of becoming liquid at a temperature which will not\r\ninjure the mould, of taking the impressions sharply, and of being\r\nsufficiently hard to bear printing from. One of the improvements in\r\nconnection with the Walter Press is in the mode of forming cylindrical\r\nstereotype casts from the paper mould. For this purpose the mould is\r\nplaced on the _internal_ surface of an iron semi-cylinder, with the face\r\nwhich has received the impression of the type inwards. The central part\r\nof the semi-cylinder is occupied by a cylindrical iron core, which is\r\nadjusted so as to leave a uniform space between its convex surface and\r\nthe concave face of the mould. Into this space is poured the melted\r\nmetal, and its pressure forces the mould closely against the concave\r\ncylindrical surface to which it is applied, so that the thickness\r\nbecomes quite uniform. The iron core has a number of grooves cut round\r\nit, and these produce in the cast so many ribs, or projections, which\r\nencircle the inner surface, and serve both to strengthen the cast and\r\nafford a ready means of obtaining an exact adjustment. Not the complete\r\ncylinder, but only half its circumference, is cast at once, the axis of\r\nthe casting apparatus being placed horizontally, and the liquid metal\r\npoured in one unbroken stream between the core and the mould from a\r\nvessel as long as the cylinders. Fig. 156 is a section of the casting\r\napparatus, in which _a_ is the core, _b_ the _papier maché_ mould, _c_\r\nthe iron semi-cylinder containing it, _d_ the metal which has been\r\npoured in at the widened space, _e_. When the metal has solidified, the\r\ncore is simply lifted off, and the cast is then taken out, in the form\r\nof a semi-cylinder, the internal surface of which has exactly the\r\ndiameter of the external surface of the roller of the machine on which\r\nit is to be placed, in company with another semi-cylindrical plate, so\r\nthat the two together encircle half the length of the roller, and when\r\nanother pair of semi-cylinders have been fixed on the other part of the\r\nroller, the whole matter of one side of the newspaper sheet, usually\r\nfour pages, is ready for printing. One great advantage of working from\r\nstereotype casts made in this way is that the form-bearing cylinder of\r\nthe machine has no greater circumference than suffices to afford space\r\nfor the matter on one side of the paper. The casts are securely fixed on\r\nthe revolving cylinder by elbows, which can be firmly screwed down. The\r\ncasts are usually made to contain one page each, so that four\r\nsemi-cylinders, each half the length of the revolving cylinder, are\r\nfixed on the circumference of the latter. The process of casting in no\r\nway injures the paper mould, which is in fact generally employed to\r\nproduce several plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 156.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 157.—_Diagram of the Walter Press._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Walter Machine is not fed with separate sheets of paper, but takes\r\nits supply from a huge roll, and itself cuts the paper into sheets after\r\nit has impressed it on both sides. This is done by a very simple but\r\neffective plan, which consists in passing the paper between two\r\nequal-sized rollers, the circumference of which is precisely the length\r\nof the sheets to be cut. These rollers grip the paper, but only on the\r\nmarginal spaces; and on the circumference of one of them, and parallel\r\nto its axis, is a slightly projecting steel blade, which fits into a\r\ncorresponding recess, or groove, in the circumference of the other, and\r\nat this time the whole width of the sheet is firmly held by a projecting\r\npiece acted on by a spring. Although the Walter Machine, as actually\r\nconstructed, presents to the uninitiated spectator an apparently endless\r\nand intricate series of parallel cylinders and rollers, yet it is in\r\nreality exceedingly simple in principle, as may be seen by the diagram\r\ngiven in Fig. 157. In this we may first direct the reader’s attention to\r\nthe two cylinders, F_{1}, F_{2}, which bear the stereotype casts—one of\r\nthe matter belonging to one side of the sheet, the other of the matter\r\nbelonging to the other side, for the Walter Press is a perfecting\r\nmachine—and the web of paper having been printed by F_{1}, against which\r\nit is pressed by the roller, P_{1}, passes straight, as shown by the\r\ndotted line, to the second pair of cylinders, in order to be printed on\r\nthe other side; and here, of course, the form cylinder, F_{2}, is below,\r\nand the impression cylinder, P_{2}, above, and an endless cleaning\r\nblanket is supplied to the latter to receive the _set-off_. The web of\r\npaper then passes between the cutting rollers, C, C_{1}, by which it is\r\ncut in sheets. But the knife has a narrow notch in the centre, and one\r\nat each end, so that the paper is not severed at those parts, narrow\r\nstrips or tags being left, which maintain for a while a slight\r\nconnection. But the tapes, _t_{1}_, _t_{2}_, between which the paper is\r\nnow carried, are driven at a rather quicker rate than the web issues\r\nfrom C, C_{1}; and the result is, that the tags are torn, and the sheet\r\nbecomes separated from the portion next following it. Thus, as a\r\nseparate sheet, it arrives at the horizontal tapes, _h_, and is brought\r\nto another set of tapes mounted on the frame, _r_, rocking about the\r\ncentre, _c_, by which it is brought finally to the tapes, _f_{1}_,\r\n_f_{2}_, which by the movement of _r_ receive the sheets alternately. A\r\nsheet-flyer, _s_, oscillates between the tapes, _f_{1}_, _f_{2}_; and as\r\nfast as the sheets arrive, lays them down right and left alternately,\r\nand it only remains for the piles, _p_{1}_, _p_{2}_ so formed, to be\r\nremoved. The inking apparatus of each form-cylinder is indicated by the\r\nseries of rollers marked I_{1}, I_{2}; and in this part of the machine\r\nthere are also some improvements over former presses, for the\r\ndistributing rollers are not made of composition, but of iron, turned\r\nwith great exactness to a true surface, and arranged so as not quite to\r\ntouch each other. At D is an apparatus for damping the paper, in which\r\nthere are hollow perforated cylinders, covered by blanket, and filled\r\nwith some porous material, which is kept constantly wet. These cylinders\r\nbeing made to rotate rapidly, the centrifugal force causes the water to\r\nfind its way uniformly to the outside. Here the paper also passes\r\nbetween rollers intended to flatten and to stretch it. At R is the great\r\nroll of paper, from which the machine takes its supply. These rolls\r\ncontain, perhaps, five miles length of paper, and at first it was a\r\nmatter of some difficulty to fix them firmly on their wooden axles, so\r\nthat they might be steadily unwound; but the contrivers of the Walter\r\nPress make these spindles as tight as may be required by forming them in\r\nwedge-shaped pieces, which can be made to increase the thickness of the\r\nspindle by drawing one upon another by screws.\r\n\r\nThe great speed of the Walter Machine is secured by the paper being\r\ndrawn by the machine itself from a continuous web, instead of being laid\r\non in a separate sheet, so that the machine is not dependent on the\r\ndexterity of the layers-on, who are besides necessarily highly-skilled\r\nworkmen, and therefore a great economy of wages results from using a\r\nmachine which does not require their services; and as the Walter Press\r\nalso itself lays down the perfected sheets, the necessary attendants are\r\nas few as possible. The waste of paper and loss of time by stoppages are\r\nsaid to be extremely small with this machine.\r\n\r\nFig. 148 will give some idea of the appearance of the printing-room\r\nwhere one of the leading London daily papers is being printed by Walter\r\nPresses.\r\n\r\nAnother fast printing machine is the type revolving cylinder machine\r\ninvented by Colonel Richard M. Hoe, and manufactured by the well-known\r\nfirm of Hoe and Company, New York, with whose name the history of fast\r\nprinting machines must ever be associated. In these machines the type is\r\nplaced on the circumference of a cylinder which rotates about a\r\nhorizontal axis, and the difficulties of securely locking up the type\r\nare successfully overcome. The machines are made with two, four, six,\r\neight, or ten impression cylinders, and at each revolution of the great\r\ncylinder the corresponding number of impressions are produced. The\r\nengraving on the opposite page, Fig. 158, represents the two-cylinder\r\nmachine, and an examination of the figure will render its general action\r\nintelligible. The form of type occupies about one-fourth of the\r\ncircumference of the great cylinder, the remainder being used as an\r\nink-distributing surface. Round this main cylinder, and parallel to it,\r\nare placed smaller impression cylinders, from two to ten in number,\r\naccording to the size of the machine. When the press is in operation,\r\nthe rotation of the main cylinder carries the type form to each\r\nimpression cylinder in succession, and it there impresses the paper,\r\nwhich is made to arrive at the right time to secure true register. One\r\nperson is required for each impression cylinder, to supply the sheets of\r\npaper, which have merely to be laid in a certain position, when, at the\r\nproper moment, they are seized by the “grippers,” or fingers of the\r\nmachine, and after having been printed, are carried out by tapes, and\r\nlaid in heaps by self-acting sheet-flyers, by which the hands which are\r\nrequired to receive and pile the sheets in other machines are dispensed\r\nwith. The ink is contained in a fountain placed beneath the main\r\ncylinder, and is conveyed by means of rollers to the distributing\r\nsurface of the main cylinder. This surface, being lower than that of the\r\ntype forms, passes by the impression cylinders without touching them.\r\nFor each impression cylinder there are two inking rollers, receiving\r\ntheir supply of ink from the distributing surface of the main cylinder.\r\nThese inking rollers, the bearings of which are, by springs, drawn\r\ntowards the axis of the main cylinder, rise as the form passes under\r\nthem, and having inked it, they again drop on to the distributing\r\nsurface. Each page of the matter is locked up on a detachable segment of\r\nthe large cylinder, which segment constitutes its bed and chase. The\r\ncolumn-rules are parallel with the shaft of the cylinder, and are\r\nconsequently straight, while the head, advertising, and dark rules have\r\nthe form of segments of a circle. The column-rules are in the shape of a\r\nwedge, with the thin end directed towards the axis of the cylinder, so\r\nas to bind the types securely. These wedge-shaped column-rules are held\r\nin their place by tongues projecting at intervals along their length,\r\nand sliding in grooves cut crosswise in the face of the bed. The spaces\r\nin the grooves between the column-rules are accurately fitted with\r\nsliding blocks of metal level with the surface of the bed, the ends of\r\nthe blocks being cut away underneath, to receive a projection on the\r\nsides of the tongues of the column-rules. The locking up is effected by\r\nmeans of screws at the foot of each page, by which the type is held as\r\nsecurely as in the ordinary manner upon a flat bed. The main cylinder of\r\nthe machine represented in Fig. 158 has a diameter of 3 ft. 9 in., and\r\nits length is, according to the size of the sheets to be printed, from 4\r\nft. 5 in. to 7 ft. 4 in. The whole is about 20 ft. long, 10 ft. wide,\r\nincluding the platforms, and a height of 9 ft. in the room in which it\r\nis placed suffices for its convenient working. The steam power required\r\nis from one to two horse-power, according to the length of the main\r\ncylinder. The speed of these machines is limited only by the ability of\r\nthe feeders to supply the sheets fast enough. The ten-cylinder machine\r\nhas, of course, ten impression cylinders, instead of two, and there are\r\nten feeding-tables, arranged one above the other, five on each side. The\r\nmain cylinder has a diameter of 4 ft. 9 in., and is 6 ft. 8 in. long.\r\nThe machine occupies altogether a space of 31 ft. by 16 ft., and its\r\nheight is 18 ft. A steam engine of eight horse-power is sufficient to\r\ndrive the ten-cylinder machine, which is then capable of producing\r\n25,000 impressions per hour. The mechanism of the larger machines is\r\nprecisely similar to that of the two-cylinder machine, except such\r\nadditional devices as are necessary to carry the paper to and from the\r\nmain cylinder at four, six, eight, or ten points of its circumference.\r\nMuch admirable contrivance is displayed in the manner of disposing\r\nfeeders as closely as possible round the central cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 158.—_Messrs. Hoe’s Type Revolving Cylinder Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn some machines, such as Messrs. Hoe’s, Fig. 158, the sheet-flyers are\r\ninteresting features, for they form an efficient contrivance for laying\r\ndown and piling up, with the greatest regularity, sheet after sheet as\r\nit issues from the press. The sheet-flyer is in fact an automatic\r\ntaker-off, and therefore it supersedes the services of the boy who would\r\notherwise be required. It is simply a light wooden framework of parallel\r\nbars, turning on one of its sides as a centre; and the tapes carrying\r\nthe sheet, passing down between the bars, bring the paper down upon the\r\nframe, where its progress is then stopped, the frame makes a rapid turn\r\non its centre, lays down the sheet, and quickly rises to receive another\r\nfrom the tapes. One can hardly see a printing machine in action without\r\nbeing struck with the deftness with which the sheet-flyer does its duty;\r\nfor the precision with which it receives a sheet, lays it down, and then\r\nquickly returns, to be ready for the next, suggest to the mind of the\r\nspectator rather the movements of a conscious agent than the motions of\r\nan unintelligent piece of mechanism. The sheet-flyer is seen at the\r\nleft-hand side of Fig. 158, where it is in the act of laying down a\r\nsheet on the pile it has already formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 159.—_Messrs. Hoe’s “Railway” Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 160.—_Napier’s Platen Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe modern improvements in printing presses are well illustrated by the\r\nmachine represented on the opposite page, Fig. 159, which has been\r\ndesigned by the Messrs. Hoe to work exclusively by hand. It is intended\r\nfor the newspaper and job work of a country office, and it works easily,\r\nwithout noise or jar, by turning the handle always in the same\r\ndirection, producing 800 impressions in an hour. The bed moves backwards\r\nand forwards on wheels running on rails, the reciprocating movement\r\nbeing derived from the circular one by means of a crank. From the mode\r\nin which the table is carried backwards and forwards, the manufacturers\r\ncall this the “Railway Printing Machine.” The paper is fed to the\r\nunderside of the cylinder, which, after an impression has been given,\r\nremains stationary while the bed is returning, and while the layer-on is\r\nadjusting his sheet of paper. The axle of the impression cylinder\r\ncarries a toothed wheel working in a rack on the bed or table, the wheel\r\nhaving at two parts of its circumference the teeth planed off so as to\r\npermit of the return of the table without moving the impression\r\ncylinder, which is again thrown into gear with the rack by a catch, so\r\nthat the same tooth of the rack always enters the same space on the\r\ntoothed wheel, and thus a good register is secured. The impression\r\ncylinder remains unaltered, whatever may be the size of the type form,\r\nit being only necessary to place the forward edge of the form always on\r\nthe same line of the bed. Machines of a very similar construction, but\r\ndriven by steam power, are used in lithographic printing; and in some of\r\nthese machines advantage is elegantly taken of the fact that, when a\r\nwheel rolls along, the uppermost point of its circumference is always\r\nmoving forward at exactly twice the velocity of its centre. Hence, if\r\nthe table of a printing machine rests on the _circumference_ of wheels,\r\na backward and forward movement of the centres of these wheels, produced\r\nby the throw of a crank through a space of 2 ft., would produce a\r\nrectilineal reciprocating movement through a distance of 4 ft. of a\r\ntable resting on the circumference of the wheels. Any reader who is\r\ninterested in geometry or mechanics would do well to convince himself\r\nthat the lowest point of the wheel of a railway carriage, for example,\r\nis stationary (considered while it is the lowest point), that the\r\n_centre_ of the wheel is moving forwards with the velocity of the train,\r\nand that the highest point of the wheel is moving forwards with just\r\ntwice the speed of the train. There is no difficulty about the rate of\r\nrectilineal motion of the centre, but the reader cannot possibly\r\nperceive the truth of the statement regarding the lowest and highest\r\npoints unless he reflects on the subject, or puts it to the test of\r\nexperiment. Another form of press which is used for good book printing\r\nis represented in the engraving, Fig. 160, which shows Napier’s platen\r\nmachine. There the action is similar to that of the ordinary hand\r\npresses as regards the mode in which the paper is pressed against the\r\nface of the type; but the movements are all performed by steam power,\r\napplied through the driving belt, shown in the figure.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of printing machines adapted to each description of\r\nwork are too numerous to admit of even a passing mention here; but those\r\nwhich have been described may fairly be considered as representing the\r\nleading principles of modern improvements. This article relates only to\r\nthe mechanism by which an impression is transferred from a form to the\r\nsurface of paper: the interesting and novel _processes_ by which the\r\nform itself may be produced—processes which have amazingly abridged the\r\nprinters’ labour and extended the resources of the art—deserve a\r\nseparate chapter, and will furnish matter for an article on Printing\r\nProcesses, which will be the better understood by being placed after\r\nchapters wherein the scientific bases of some of these processes are\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _PATTERN PRINTING._\r\n\r\nThe machines used for printing patterns are, in principle, very similar\r\nto those for letterpress printing; but the circumstance of several\r\ndifferent colours having frequently to go to the production of one\r\npattern leads to the multiplication, in the present class of machines,\r\nof the apparatus for distributing the colours and impressing the\r\nmaterials. Pattern printing machines are most extensively used for\r\nimpressing fabrics, such as calicoes, muslins, &c., and for producing\r\nthe wall-papers for decorating apartments. The machines employed for\r\ncalicoes and for papers are so much alike, that to describe the one is\r\nalmost to describe the other.\r\n\r\nThe papers intended for paper-hangings are, in the first instance,\r\ncovered with a uniform layer of the colour which is to form the ground,\r\nand this is done even in the case of papers which are to have a white\r\nground. The colours thus laid on, and those which are applied by the\r\nmachine, are composed of finely-ground colouring matters mixed with thin\r\nsize or glue to a suitable consistence, and the ground-tint is given by\r\nbringing the upper surface of the paper, as it is mechanically unwound\r\nfrom a great roll, into contact with an endless band of cloth emerging\r\nfrom a trough containing a supply of the fluid colour. The paper then\r\npasses over a horizontal table, where the layer of colour is uniformly\r\ndistributed over its surface by brushes moved by machinery, and the\r\npaper, after having been thoroughly dried, is ready to receive the\r\nimpressions. The impressions may be given by flat blocks of wood on\r\nwhich the pattern is carved in relief, or from revolving cylinders on\r\nwhich the pattern is similarly carved. The former is the process of hand\r\nlabour called “block printing,” and it requires much skill and care on\r\nthe part of the operator; but with these, excellent results are\r\nobtained, as a correct adjustment of the positions of the parts of the\r\npattern can always be secured. The latter is the mode of printing\r\nmechanically on rollers, corresponding with the type-bearing cylinders\r\nof the machines already described; but for pattern printing on paper\r\nthey are made of fine-grained wood, mounted on an iron axle, and they\r\nare carved so that the design to be printed stands out in relief on\r\ntheir surface. One of these rollers is represented in Fig. 161, and it\r\nshould be clearly understood that each colour in the pattern on a\r\nwall-paper requires a separate roller, the design cut on which\r\ncorresponds only with the forms the particular colour contributes to the\r\npattern. Such rollers being necessarily somewhat expensive, as the\r\npattern is usually repeated many times over the cylindrical surface, the\r\nplan has been adopted of fastening a mass of hard composition in an iron\r\naxle, and when this has been turned to a truly cylindrical surface, it\r\nis made to receive plates of metal, formed of a fusible alloy of lead,\r\ntin, and nickel. These plates are simply casts from a single carved\r\nwooden mould of the pattern, which has thus only once to be formed by\r\nhand. The plates are readily bent when warmed, and are thus applied to\r\nthe cylindrical surface, to which they are then securely attached. It is\r\nfound advantageous to cover the prominent parts of the rollers which\r\nproduce the impressions with a thin layer of felt, as this substance\r\ntakes up the colours much more readily than wood or metal, and leaves a\r\ncleaner impression.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 161.—_Roller for Printing Wall-Papers._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe machine by which wall-papers are printed is represented in Fig. 162,\r\nwhere it will be observed that the impression cylinder has a very large\r\ndiameter, and that a portion of its circumference forms a toothed wheel,\r\nwhich engages a number of equal-sized pinions placed at intervals about\r\nits periphery. Each pinion being fixed on the axle of a pattern-bearing\r\nroller, these are all made to revolve at the same rate. There is,\r\nhowever, some adjustment necessary before that exact correspondence of\r\nthe impressions with each other is secured, which is shown on the\r\nprinted pattern by each colour being precisely in its appointed place.\r\nThe rollers are constantly supplied with colour by endless cloths, which\r\nreceive it from the troughs that are shown in the figure, one trough\r\nbeing appropriated to each roller. Some of these machines can print as\r\nmany as eighteen or twenty different colours at once, by having that\r\nnumber of rollers; and it is easy to see how, by dividing each trough\r\ninto several vertical compartments, in each of which a different colour\r\nis placed, it would be possible to triple or even quadruple the number\r\nof colours printed by one machine.\r\n\r\nThe machinery by which calicoes are printed is almost identical in\r\nconstruction with that just described, and presents the same general\r\nappearance. There is, however, an important difference in the rollers,\r\nwhich in calico printing are of copper or bronze, and have the design\r\nengraved upon their polished cylindrical surface, not in relief, but in\r\nhollows. After the whole surface of the roller becomes charged with\r\ncolour, there is in the machine a straight-edge, which removes the\r\ncolour from the smooth surface, leaving only what has entered into the\r\nhollow spaces of the design, which, as the roller comes round to the\r\ncloth, yield it up to the surface of the latter. Thus, by a self-acting\r\narrangement, the rollers are charged with colour, cleaned, and made to\r\ngive up their impressions to the stuff by parting with the colour in the\r\nhollows. Rollers having patterns in relief are also used in calico\r\nprinting, the mechanism being then almost identical with that of the\r\nformer machine. It need hardly be said that great pains are taken in the\r\nconstruction of such machines to have each part very accurately\r\nadjusted, so that the impression may fall precisely upon the proper\r\nplace, without any blurring or confusion of the colours, and the fact\r\nthat an intricate design, having perhaps eighteen or twenty tints, can\r\nbe thus mechanically reproduced millions of times speaks volumes for the\r\naccuracy and finish of the workmanship which are bestowed on such\r\nprinting machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 162.—_Machine for Printing Paper-Hangings._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 163.—_Chain-Testing Machine at Messrs. Brown and Lenox’s Works,\r\n    Millwall._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            HYDRAULIC POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a hollow sphere, _a_, Fig. 173, be pierced with a number of small\r\nholes at various points, and a cylinder, _b_, provided with a piston,\r\n_c_, fitted into it, when the apparatus is filled with water, and the\r\npiston is pushed inwards, the water will spout out of all the orifices\r\nequally, and not exclusively from that which is opposite to the piston\r\nand in the direction of its pressure. The jets of water so produced\r\nwould not, as a matter of fact, all pursue straight paths radiating from\r\nthe centre of the sphere, because gravity would act upon them; and all,\r\nexcept those which issued vertically, would take curved forms. But when\r\nproper allowance is made for this circumstance, each jet is seen to be\r\nprojected with equal force in the direction of a radius of the sphere.\r\nThis experiment proves that when pressure is applied to any part of a\r\nliquid, that pressure is transmitted _in all directions equally_. Thus\r\nthe pressure of the piston—which, in the apparatus represented in the\r\nfigure, is applied in the direction of the axis of the cylinder only—is\r\ncarried throughout the whole mass of the liquid, and shows itself by its\r\neffect in urging the water out of the orifices in the sphere in all\r\ndirections; and since the force with which the water rushes out is the\r\nsame at every jet, it is plain that the water must press equally against\r\neach unit of area of the inside surface of the hollow sphere, without\r\nregard to the position of the unit.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the piston to have an area of one square inch, and to be\r\npushed inwards with a force of 10 lbs., it cannot be doubted that the\r\nsquare inch of the inner surface of sphere immediately opposite the\r\ncylinder will receive also the pressure of 10 lbs.; and since the\r\npressures throughout the interior of the hollow globe are equal, every\r\nsquare inch of its area will also be pressed outwards with a force equal\r\nto 10 lbs. Hence, if the total area of the interior be 100 square\r\ninches, the whole pressure produced will amount to a hundred times 10\r\nlbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 164.—_Pascal’s Principle._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 165.—_Collar of Hydraulic Cylinder._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThat water or any other liquid would behave in the manner just described\r\nmight be deduced from a property of liquids which is sufficiently\r\nobvious, namely, the freedom with which their particles move or slide\r\nupon each other. The equal transmission of pressure in all directions\r\nthrough liquids was first clearly expressed by the celebrated Pascal,\r\nand it is therefore known as “Pascal’s principle.” He said that “if a\r\nclosed vessel filled with water has two openings, one of which is a\r\nhundred times as large as the other; and if each opening be provided\r\nwith an exactly-fitting piston, a man pushing in the small piston could\r\nbalance the efforts of a hundred men pushing in the other, and he could\r\novercome the force of ninety-nine.” Pascal’s principle—which is that of\r\nthe hydraulic press—may be illustrated by Fig. 164, in which two tubes\r\nof unequal areas, _a_ and _b_, communicate with each, and are supposed\r\nto be filled with a liquid—water, for example, which will, of course,\r\nstand at the same level in both branches. Let us now imagine that\r\npistons exactly fitting the tubes, and yet quite free to move, are\r\nplaced upon the columns of liquid—the larger of which, _b_, we shall\r\nsuppose to have five times the diameter, and therefore twenty-five times\r\nthe sectional area, of the smaller one. A pressure of 1 lb. applied to\r\nthe smaller piston would, in such a case, produce an upward pressure on\r\nthe larger piston of 25 lbs.; and in order to keep the piston at rest,\r\nwe should have to place a weight of 25 lbs. upon it. Here then a certain\r\nforce appears to produce a much larger one, and the extent to which the\r\nlatter may be increased is limited only by the means of increasing the\r\narea of the piston. Practically, however, we should not by any such\r\narrangement be able to prove that there is exactly the same proportion\r\nbetween the total pressures as between the areas, for the pistons could\r\nnot be made to fit with sufficient closeness without at the same time\r\ngiving rise to so much friction as to render exact comparisons\r\nimpossible. We may, however, still imagine a theoretical perfection in\r\nour apparatus, and see what further consequences may be deduced,\r\nremembering always that the actual results obtained in practice would\r\ndiffer from these only by reason of interfering causes, which can be\r\ntaken into account when required. We have supposed hitherto that the\r\npressures of the pistons exactly balance each other. Now, so long as the\r\nsystem thus remains in equilibrium no _work_ is done; but if the\r\nsmallest additional weight were placed upon either piston, that one\r\nwould descend and the other would be pushed up. As we have supposed the\r\napparatus to act without friction, so we shall also neglect the effects\r\ndue to difference in the levels of the columns of liquid when the\r\npistons are moved; and further, in order to fix our ideas, let us\r\nimagine the smaller tube to have a section of 1 square inch in area, and\r\nthe larger one of 25 square inches. Now, if the weight of the piston,\r\n_a_, be increased by the smallest fraction of a grain, it will descend.\r\nWhen it has descended a distance of 25 in., then 25 cubic inches of\r\nwater must have passed into _b_, and, to make room for this quantity of\r\nliquid, the piston with the weight of 25 lbs. upon it must have risen\r\naccordingly. But since the area of the larger tube is 25 in., a rise of\r\n1 in. will exactly suffice for this; so that a weight of 1 lb.\r\ndescending through a space of 25 in., raises a weight of 25 lbs. through\r\na space of 1 in. This is an illustration of a principle holding good in\r\nall machines, which is sometimes vaguely expressed by saying that _what\r\nis gained in power is lost in time_. In this case we have the piston,\r\n_b_, moving through the space of 1 in. in the same time that the piston\r\na moves through 25 in.; and therefore the _velocity_ of the latter is\r\ntwenty-five times greater than that of the former, but the time is the\r\nsame. It would be more precise to say, that what is gained in force is\r\nlost in space; or, that no machine, whatever may be its nature or\r\nconstruction, is of itself capable of doing _work_. The “mechanical\r\npowers,” as they are called, can do but the work done upon them, and\r\ntheir use is only to change the relative amounts of the two factors, the\r\nproduct of which measures the work, namely, space and force. Pascal\r\nhimself, in connection with the passage quoted above, clearly points out\r\nthat in the new mechanical power suggested by him in the hydraulic\r\npress, “the same rule is met with as in the old ones—such as the lever,\r\nwheel and axle, screw, &c.—which is, that the distance is increased in\r\nproportion to the force; for it is evident that as one of the openings\r\nis a hundred times larger than the other, if the man who pushes the\r\nsmall piston drives it forward 1 in., he will drive backward the large\r\npiston one-hundredth part of that length only.” Though the hydraulic\r\npress was thus distinctly proposed as a machine by Pascal, a certain\r\ndifficulty prevented the suggestion from becoming of any practical\r\nutility. It was found impossible, by any ordinary plan of packing, to\r\nmake the piston fit without allowing the water to escape when the\r\npressure became considerable. This difficulty was overcome by Bramah,\r\nwho, about the end of last century, contrived a simple and elegant plan\r\nof packing the piston, and first made the hydraulic press an efficient\r\nand useful machine. Fig. 166 is a view of an ordinary hydraulic press,\r\nin which a is a very strong iron cylinder, represented in the figure\r\nwith a part broken off, in order to show that inside of it is an iron\r\npiston or ram, _b_, which works up and down through a water-tight\r\ncollar; and in this part is the invention by which Bramah overcame the\r\ndifficulties that had previously been met with in making the hydraulic\r\npress of practical use. Bramah’s contrivance is shown by the section of\r\nthe cylinder, Fig. 165, where the interior of the neck is seen to have a\r\ngroove surrounding it, into which fits a ring of leather bent into a\r\nshape resembling an inverted U. The ring is cut out of a flat piece of\r\nstout leather, well oiled and bent into the required shape. The effect\r\nof the pressure of the water is to force the leather more tightly\r\nagainst the ram, and as the pressure becomes greater, the tighter is the\r\nfit of the collar, so that no water escapes even with very great\r\npressures. To the ram, _b_, Fig. 166, a strong iron table, _c_, is\r\nattached, and on this are placed the articles to be compressed. Four\r\nwrought iron columns, _d d d d_, support another strong plate, _e_, and\r\nmaintain it in a position to resist the upward pressure of the goods\r\nwhen the ram rises, and they are squeezed between the two tables. The\r\ninterior of the large cylinder communicates by means of the pipe, _f f_,\r\nwith the suction and force-pump, _g_, in which a small plunger, _o_,\r\nworks water-tight. Suppose that the cylinders and tubes are quite filled\r\nwith water, and that the ram and piston are in the positions represented\r\nin the figure. When the piston of the pump, _g_, is raised, the space\r\nbelow it is instantly filled with water, which enters from the\r\nreservoir, _h_, through the valve, _i_, the valve _k_ being closed by\r\nthe pressure above it, so that no water can find its way back from the\r\npipe, _f_, into the small cylinder. When the piston has completed its\r\nascent, the interior of the small cylinder is therefore completely\r\nfilled with water from the reservoir; and when the piston is pushed\r\ndown, the valve, _i_, instantly closes, and all egress of the liquid in\r\nthat direction being prevented, the greater pressure in _g_ forces open\r\nthe valve, _k_, and the water flows along the tube, _f_, into the large\r\ncylinder. The pressure exerted by the plunger in the small cylinder,\r\nbeing transmitted according to the principles already explained,\r\nproduces on each portion of the area of the large plunger equal to that\r\nof the smaller an exactly equal pressure. In the smaller hydraulic\r\npresses the plunger of the forcing-pump is worked by a lever, as\r\nrepresented in the figure at _n_; so that with a given amount of force\r\napplied by the hand to the end of the lever, the pressure exerted by the\r\npress will depend upon the proportion of the sectional area of _b_ to\r\nthat of _o_, and also upon the proportion of the length _m n_, to the\r\nlength _m l_. To fix our ideas, let us suppose that the distance from\r\n_m_ of the point _n_ where the hand is applied is ten times the distance\r\n_m l_, and that the sectional area of _b_ is a hundred times that of\r\n_o_. If a force of 60 lbs. be applied at _n_, this will produce a\r\ndownward pressure at _m_ equal to 60 × 10, and then the pressure\r\ntransmitted to the ram of the great cylinder will be 60 × 10 × 100 =\r\n60,000 lbs. The apparatus is provided with a safety-valve at _p_, which\r\nis loaded with a weight; so that when the pressure exceeds a desired\r\namount, the valve opens and the water escapes. There is also an\r\narrangement at _q_ for allowing the water to flow out when it is desired\r\nto relieve the pressure, and the water is then forced out by the large\r\nplunger, which slowly descends to occupy its place. The body of the\r\ncylinder is placed beneath the floor in such presses as that represented\r\nin Fig. 166, in order to afford ready access to the table on which the\r\narticles to be compressed are placed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 166.—_Hydraulic Press._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe force which may, by a machine of this kind, be brought to bear upon\r\nsubstances submitted to its action, is limited only by the power of the\r\nmaterials of the press to resist the strains put upon them. If water be\r\ncontinually forced into the cylinder of such a machine, then, whatever\r\nmay be the resistance offered to the ascent of the plunger, it must\r\nyield, or otherwise some part of the machine itself must yield, either\r\nby rupture of the hydraulic cylinder, or by the bursting of the\r\nconnecting-pipe or the forcing-pump. This result is certain, for the\r\nwater refuses to be compressed, at least to any noticeable degree, and\r\ntherefore, by making the area of the plunger of the force-pump\r\nsufficiently small, there is no limit to the pressure per square inch\r\nwhich can be produced in the hydraulic cylinder; or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, the limit is reached only when the pressure in the hydraulic\r\ncylinder is equal to the cohesive strength of the material (cast or\r\nwrought iron) of which it is formed. It has been found that when the\r\ninternal pressure per square inch exceeds the cohesive or tensile\r\nstrength of a rod of the metal 1 in. square (see page 207), no increase\r\nin the thickness of the metal will enable the cylinder to resist the\r\npressure. Professor Rankine has given the following formula for\r\ncalculating the external radius, R, of a hollow cylinder of which the\r\ninternal radius is _r_, the pressure per square inch which it is desired\r\nshould be applied before the cylinder would yield being indicated by\r\n_p_, while _f_ represents the tensile strength of the materials:\r\n\r\n                   R = _r_√((_f_ + _p_)/(_f_ – _p_))\r\n\r\nWe may see in this formula that as the value of _p_ becomes more and\r\nmore nearly equal to _f_, the less does the divisor (_f_ – _p_) become,\r\nand therefore the greater is the corresponding value of R; and when _f_\r\n= _p_, or _f_ – _p_ = 0, the interpretation would be that no value of R\r\nwould be sufficiently great to satisfy the equation. Thus a cylinder,\r\nmade of cast iron, of which the breaking strain is 8 tons per square\r\ninch, would have its inner surface ruptured by that amount of internal\r\npressure, and the water passing into the fissures would exert its\r\npressure with ever-increasing destructive effect.\r\n\r\nWith certain modifications in the proportions and arrangement of its\r\nparts, the hydraulic press is used for squeezing the juices from\r\nvegetable substances, such as beetroots, &c., for pressing oils from\r\nseeds, and, in fact, all purposes where a powerful, steady, and easily\r\nregulated pressure is needed. Cannons and steam boilers are tested by\r\nhydraulic pressure, by forcing water into them by means of a force-pump,\r\njust as it is forced into the cylinder of the hydraulic press described\r\nabove. This mode of testing the strength has several great advantages;\r\nfor not only can the pressure be regulated and its amount accurately\r\nknown; but in case the cannon or steam boiler should give way, there is\r\nno danger, for it does not explode—the metal is simply ruptured, and the\r\nmoment this takes place, the water flows out and the strain at once\r\nceases.\r\n\r\nThe strength of bars, chains, cables, and anchors is also tested by\r\nhydraulic power, and the engraving at the head of this article, Fig.\r\n163, represents the hydraulic testing machine at the works of Messrs.\r\nBrown and Lenox, the eminent chain and anchor manufacturers, of\r\nMillwall. Immediately in front of the spectator are the force-pumps, and\r\nthe steam engine by which they are driven. It will be observed that four\r\nplungers are attached to an oscillating beam in such a manner that the\r\nwater is continuously forced into the hydraulic cylinder. The outer pair\r\nof plungers are of much larger diameter than the inner pair, in order\r\nthat the supply of water may be cut off from the former when the\r\npressure is approaching the desired limit, and the smaller pair alone\r\nthen go on pumping in the water, the pressure being thus more gradually\r\nincreased. Behind the engine and forcing pump is the massive iron\r\ncylinder, where the pressure is made to act on a piston, which is forced\r\ntowards that end of the cylinder seen in the drawing. The piston is\r\nattached to a very thick piston-rod, moving through a water-tight collar\r\nat the other end of the cylinder. The effect of the hydraulic pressure\r\nis, therefore, to draw the piston-rod into the cylinder, and not, as in\r\nthe apparatus represented in Fig. 166, to force a plunger out. The head\r\nof the piston-rod is provided with a strong shackle, to which the chains\r\nto be tested can be attached. In a line with the axis of the cylinder is\r\na trough, some 90 ft. long, to hold the chain, and at the farther end of\r\nthe trough is another very strong shackle, to which the other end of the\r\nchain is made fast. A peculiarity of Messrs. Brown and Lenox’s machine\r\nis the mode in which the tension is measured. In many cases it is deemed\r\nsufficient to ascertain by some kind of gauge the pressure of the water\r\nin the hydraulic cylinder, and from that to deduce the pull upon the\r\nchain; but the Messrs. Brown have found that every form of gauge is\r\nliable to give fallacious indications, from variations of temperature\r\nand other circumstances, and they prefer to measure the strain directly.\r\nThis is accomplished by attaching the shackle at the farther extremity\r\nof the trough to the short arm of a lever, turning upon hard steel\r\nbearings, the long arm of this lever acting upon the short arm of\r\nanother, and so on until the weight of 1 lb. at the end of the last\r\nlever will balance a pull on the chain of 2,240 lbs., or 1 ton. The\r\ntension is thus directly measured by a system of levers, exactly\r\nresembling those used in a common weighing machine, and this is done so\r\naccurately that even when a chain is being subjected to a strain of many\r\ntons, an additional pull, such as one can give to the shackle-link with\r\none hand, at once shows itself in the weighing-room. The person who has\r\ncharge of this part of the machine places on the end of the lever a\r\nweight of as many pounds as the number of tons strain to which the chain\r\nto be tested has to be submitted. The engineer sets the pump in action,\r\nthe water is rapidly forced into the cylinder, the piston is thrust\r\ninwards, and the strain upon the chain begins; the engineer then cuts\r\noff the water supply from the larger force-pumps, and the smaller pair\r\ngo on until the strain becomes sufficient to raise the weight, and then\r\nthe person in the weighing-room, by pulling a wire, opens a valve in\r\nconnection with the hydraulic cylinder, which allows the water to\r\nescape, and the strain is at once taken off. This testing machine, which\r\nis capable of testing cables up to 200 tons or more, was originally\r\ndesigned by Sir T. Brown, the late head of the firm, and not only was\r\nthe first constructed in the country, but remains unsurpassed in the\r\nprecision of its indications.\r\n\r\nThe testing of cables, which we have just described, is a matter of the\r\nhighest importance, for the failure of cables and anchors places ships\r\nand men’s life in great danger, since vessels have frequently to ride\r\nout a storm at anchor, and should the cables give way, a ship would then\r\nbe almost entirely at the mercy of the winds and waves. Hence the\r\nGovernment have, with regard to cables and anchors, very properly made\r\ncertain stringent regulations, which apply not only to the navy but to\r\nmerchant shipping. The chain-cable is itself a comparatively modern\r\napplication of iron, for sixty years ago our line-of-battle ships\r\ncarried only huge hempen cables of some 8 in. or 9 in. diameter.\r\nChain-cables have now almost entirely superseded ropes, though some\r\nships carry a hempen cable, for use under peculiar circumstances. The\r\nlargest chain-cables have links in which the iron has a diameter of\r\nnearly 3 in., and these cables are considered good and sound when they\r\ncan bear a strain of 136 tons. Such are the cables used in the British\r\nnavy for the largest ships. Of course, there are many smaller-sized\r\ncables also in use, and the strains to which these are subjected when\r\nthey are tested in the Government dockyards vary according to the\r\nthickness of the iron; but it is found that nearly one out of every four\r\ncables supplied to the Admiralty proves defective in some part, which\r\nhas to be replaced by a sounder piece. The chain-cables made by Messrs.\r\nBrown and Lenox for the _Great Eastern_ are, as might have been\r\nexpected, of the very stoutest construction; the best workmanship and\r\nthe finest quality of iron having been employed in their manufacture.\r\nThese cables were tested up to 148 tons, a greater strain than had ever\r\nbefore been applied as a test to any chain, and it was found that a pull\r\nrepresented by at least 172 tons was required to break them. It is\r\ndifficult to believe that a teacup-full of cold water shoved down a\r\nnarrow pipe is able to rend asunder the massive links which more than\r\nsuffice to hold the huge ship securely to her anchors, but such is\r\nnevertheless the sober fact. The regulations of the Board of Trade\r\nrequire that every cable or anchor sold for use in merchant ships is to\r\nbe previously tested by an authorized and licensed tester, who, if he\r\nfinds it bears the proper strain, stamps upon it a certain mark.\r\n\r\nThe means which is afforded by hydraulic power of applying enormous\r\npressures has been taken advantage of in a great many of the arts, of\r\nwhich, indeed, there are few that have not, directly or indirectly,\r\nbenefited by this mode of modifying force. An illustration, taken at\r\nrandom, may be found in the machinery employed at Woolwich for making\r\nelongated rifle-bullets. The bullets are formed by forcing into dies,\r\nwhich give the required shape, little cylinders of solid lead, cut off\r\nby the machine itself from a continuous cylindrical rod of the metal.\r\nThe rod, or rather filament, of lead is wound like a rope on large\r\nreels, from which it is fed to the machine. It is in the production of\r\nthis solid leaden rope or filament that hydraulic pressure is used.\r\nAbout 4 cwt. of melted lead is poured into a very massive iron cylinder,\r\nthe inside of which has a diameter of 7½ in., while the external\r\ndiameter is no less than 2 ft. 6 in., so that the sides of the cylinder\r\nare actually 11¼ in. thick. When the lead has cooled so far as that it\r\nhas passed into a half solid state, a ram or plunger, accurately fitting\r\nthe bore of the cylinder, is forced down by hydraulic pressure upon the\r\nsemi-fluid metal. This plunger is provided with a round hole throughout\r\nits entire length, and as it is urged against the half solidified metal\r\nwith enormous pressure, the lead yields, and is forced out through the\r\nhole in the plunger, making its appearance at the top as a continuous\r\ncylindrical filament, quite solid, but still hot. This is wound upon the\r\nlarge iron reels as fast as it emerges from the opening in the plunger,\r\nand these reels are then taken to the bullet-shaping machine, which\r\nsnips off length after length of the leaden cord, and fashions it into\r\nbullets for the Martini-Henry rifle. The leaden pipes which are so much\r\nused for conveying water and gas in houses are made in a similar manner,\r\nmetal being forced out of an annular opening, which is formed by putting\r\nan iron rod, having its diameter of the required bore of the pipe, in\r\nthe middle of the circular opening. The lead in escaping between the rod\r\nand the sides of the opening takes the form of a pipe, and is wound upon\r\nlarge iron reels, as in the former case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 167.—_Section of Hydraulic Lift Graving Dock._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 168.—_Section of Column._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting application of hydraulic power is to the raising of\r\nships vertically out of the water, in order to examine the bottoms of\r\ntheir hulls, and effect any necessary repairs. The hydraulic lift\r\ngraving dock, in which this is done, is the invention of Mr. E. Clark,\r\nwho, under the direction of Mr. Robert Stephenson, designed the\r\nmachinery and superintended the raising of the tubes of the Britannia\r\nBridge, where a weight of 1,800 tons was lifted by only three presses.\r\nThe suitability of the hydraulic press for such work as slowly raising a\r\nvessel was doubtless suggested to him in connection with this\r\ncircumstance, and the durability, economy, and small loss of power which\r\noccurs in the action of the press, pointed it out as particularly\r\nadapted for this purpose. The ordinary dry dock is simply an excavation,\r\nlined with timber or masonry, from which the tide is excluded by a gate,\r\nwhich, after the vessel has entered the dock at high water, is closed;\r\nand when the tide has ebbed, and left the vessel dry, the sluice through\r\nwhich the water has escaped is also closed. In a tideless harbour the\r\nwater has to be pumped out of the dock, and this last method is also\r\nadopted even in tidal waters, so that the docks may be independent of\r\nthe state of the tides. The lift of Clark’s graving dock is a direct\r\napplication of the power of the hydraulic press, and we select for\r\ndescription the graving dock constructed at the Victoria Docks for the\r\nThames Graving Dock Company, whose works occupy 26 acres. Fig. 167 is a\r\ntransverse section of this hydraulic lift graving dock, in which there\r\nare two rows of cast iron columns, 5 ft. in diameter at the base, where\r\nthey are sunk 12 ft. in the ground, and 4 ft. in diameter above the\r\nground. The clear distance between the two rows is 60 ft., and the\r\ncolumns are placed 20 ft. apart from centre to centre, sixteen columns\r\nin each row, thus giving a length of 310 ft. to the platform, but\r\nvessels of 350 ft. in length may practically be lifted. The bases of the\r\ncolumns, one of which is represented in section in Fig. 168, are filled\r\nwith concrete, on which the feet of the hydraulic cylinders rest. The\r\nouter columns support no weight, but act merely as guides for the\r\ncrossheads attached to the plungers. The height of the columns is 68½\r\nft., and a wrought iron framed platform connects the columns at the top.\r\nIn order that any inequalities in the height of the rams may be\r\ndetected, a scale is painted on each column, to mark the positions of\r\nthe crossheads. The hydraulic cylinders, which are within these columns,\r\nhave solid rams of 10 in. diameter, with a stroke of 25 ft., and on the\r\ntops of these are fastened the crossheads, 7½ ft. long, made of wrought\r\niron, and supporting at the ends bars of iron, to the other ends of\r\nwhich the girders of the platform are suspended. The girders are,\r\ntherefore, sixteen in number, and together form a gridiron platform,\r\nwhich can be raised or lowered with the vessel upon it. The thirty-two\r\nhydraulic cylinders were tested at a pressure of more than 3 tons per\r\nsquare inch. The water is admitted immediately beneath the collars at\r\nthe top (this being the most accessible position) by pipes of only ½ in.\r\ndiameter, leading from the force-pumps, of which there are twelve, of 1⅞\r\nin. diameter, directly worked by a fifty horse-power steam engine. The\r\npresses are worked in three groups—one of sixteen, and two of eight\r\npresses,—so arranged that their centres of action form a sort of tripod\r\nsupport, and the presses of each group are so connected that perfect\r\nuniformity of pressure is maintained. The raising of a vessel is\r\naccomplished in about twenty-five minutes, by placing below the vessel a\r\npontoon, filled in the first instance with water, and then raising the\r\npontoon with the vessel on it, while the water is allowed to escape from\r\nthe pontoon through certain valves; then when the girders are again\r\nlowered, the pontoon, with the vessel on it, remains afloat. Thus in\r\nthirty minutes a ship drawing, say, 18 ft. of water is lifted on a\r\nshallow pontoon, drawing, perhaps, only 5 ft., and the whole is floated\r\nto a shallow dock, where, surrounded with workshops, the vessel, now\r\nhigh and dry, is ready to receive the necessary repairs. The number of\r\nvessels which can thus be docked is limited only by the number of\r\npontoons, and thus the same lift serves to raise and lower any number of\r\nships, which are floated on and off its platform by the pontoons. With a\r\npressure in the hydraulic cylinders of about 2 tons upon each square\r\ninch, the combined action of these thirty-two presses would raise a ship\r\nweighing 5,000 tons.\r\n\r\nHydraulic power has been used not only for graving docks, as shown in\r\nthe above figures, but also for dragging ships out of the water up an\r\ninclined plane. The machinery for this purpose was invented by Mr.\r\nMiller for hauling ships up the inclined plane of “Martin’s slip,” at\r\nthe upper end of which the press cylinder is placed, at the same slope\r\nas the inclined plane, and the ship is attached, by means of chains, to\r\na crosshead fixed on the plunger. Hydraulic power has also been used for\r\nlaunching ships, and the launch of the _Great Eastern_ is a memorable\r\ninstance; for the great ship stuck fast, and it was only by the\r\napplication of an immense pressure, exerted by hydraulic apparatus, that\r\nshe could be induced to take to the water. Water pressure is also\r\napplied to hoists for raising and lowering heavy bodies, and in such\r\ncases the pressure which is obtained by simply taking the water supply\r\nfrom an elevated source, or from the water-main of a town, is sometimes\r\nmade use of, instead of that obtained by a forcing pump. The lift at the\r\nAlbert Hall, South Kensington, by which persons may pass to and from the\r\ngallery without making use of the stairs, is worked by hydraulic\r\npressure in the manner just mentioned. In such lifts or hoists there is\r\na vertical cylinder, in which works a leather-packed piston, having a\r\npiston-rod passing upwards through a stuffing-box in the top of the\r\ncylinder. The upper end of the piston-rod has a pulley of 30 in. or 36\r\nin. diameter, attached to it, and round this pulley is passed a chain,\r\none end of which is fixed, and the other fastened to the movable cage or\r\nframe. So that the cage moves with twice the speed of the piston, and\r\nthe length of the stroke of the latter is one-half of the range of the\r\ncage.\r\n\r\nSir William Armstrong has applied hydraulic power to cranes and other\r\nmachines in combination with chains and pulleys. His hydraulic crane is\r\nrepresented by the diagram, Fig. 169, intended to show only the general\r\ndisposition of the principal parts of this machine, which is so\r\nadmirably arranged that one man can raise, lower, or swing round the\r\nheaviest load with a readiness and apparent ease marvellous to behold.\r\nHere it is proper to mention once for all, that the pressure for the\r\nhydraulic machines is obtained not only by natural heads of water, or by\r\nforcing-pumps worked by hand, but very frequently by forcing-pumps\r\nworked by steam power. It is usual to have a set of three pumps with\r\ntheir plungers connected respectively with three cranks on one shaft,\r\nmaking angles of 120° with each other. A special feature of Sir W.\r\nArmstrong’s hydraulic crane is the arrangement by which the engines are\r\nmade to be always storing up power by forcing water into the vessel,\r\n_a_, called the “accumulator.” The accumulator—which in the diagram is\r\nnot shown in its true position—may be placed in any convenient place\r\nnear the crane, and consists of a large cast iron cylinder, _b_, fitted\r\nwith a plunger, _c_, moving water-tight through the neck of the\r\ncylinder. To the head of the plunger is attached by iron cross-bars, _d\r\nd_, a strong iron case filled with heavy materials, so as to load the\r\nplunger, _c_, with a weight that will produce a pressure of about 600\r\nlbs. upon each square inch of the inner surface of the cylinder. The\r\nwater is pumped into the cylinder by the pumping engines through the\r\npipe, _f_, and then the piston rises, carrying with it the loaded case,\r\nguided by the timber framework, _g_, until it reaches the top of its\r\nrange, when it moves a lever that cuts off the supply of steam from the\r\npumping engine. When the crane is working the water passes out of the\r\ncylinder, _a_, by the pipe, _h_, and exerts its pressures on the\r\nplungers of the smaller cylinders; and the plunger of the accumulator,\r\nin beginning its descent again, moves the lever in connection with the\r\nthrottle-valve of the engine, and thus again starts the pumps, which\r\ntherefore at once begin to supply more water to the accumulator. The\r\nlatter is, however, large enough to keep all the several smaller\r\ncylinders of the machine at work even when they are all in operation at\r\nonce. Fig. 169 shows a sketch elevation and a ground plan of the crane\r\nas constructed to carry loads of 1 ton, but the size of the cylinders is\r\nsomewhat exaggerated, and all details, such as pipes, guides, valves,\r\nrods, &c., are omitted. The hydraulic apparatus is entirely below the\r\nflooring—only the levers by which the valves are opened and closed\r\nappearing above the surface. The crane-post, _i_, is made of wrought\r\niron: it is hollow and stationary; the jib, _k_, is connected with the\r\nties, _l_, by side-pieces, _n_, which are joined by a cross-piece at\r\n_m_, turning on a swivel and bearing the pulley, _u_. The jib and the\r\nside-pieces are attached at _o_ to a piece turning round the crane-post,\r\nand provided with a friction roller, _p_, which receives the thrust of\r\nthe jib against the crane-post; the same piece is carried below the\r\nflooring and is surrounded with a groove, which the links of the chain,\r\n_q_, fit. This chain serves to swing the crane round, and for this\r\npurpose the hydraulic cylinders, _r_, _r´_, come into operation. The\r\nplungers of these have each a pulley, over which passes the chain _q_,\r\nhaving its ends fastened to the cylinders, so that when, by the pressure\r\nof the water, one plunger is forced out, the other is pushed in, and the\r\nchain passing round the groove at _s_ swings the jib round. The\r\ncylinders are supplied with water by pipes—omitted in the sketch, as are\r\nalso those by which the water leaves the cylinders. These pipes are\r\nconnected with valves—also omitted on account of the scale of the\r\ndiagram being too small to show their details—so that the movement of a\r\nlever, _t_, in one or the other direction at the same time connects one\r\ncylinder with the supply and the other with the exit-pipe. When the\r\ncrane is swinging round, the sudden closing of the valves would produce\r\nan injurious shock, and to prevent this relief-valves are provided on\r\nboth the supply and exit-pipes communicating with each cylinder. When,\r\ntherefore, the valves are closed, the impetus of the jib and its load\r\nacting on the chain, and through that on the plungers, continues to move\r\nthe latter, the motion is permitted to take place by the relief-valves\r\nopening, and allowing water to enter or leave the cylinders against the\r\npressure of the water. There is also a self-acting arrangement by which,\r\nwhen these plungers have moved to the extent of their range in either\r\ndirection, the valves are closed. The chain of the crane rests on guide\r\npulleys, and passing over the pulley _u_, goes down the centre of the\r\ncrane-post to the pulley _v_, and thence passes backwards and forwards\r\nover a series of three pulleys at _w_ and two at _x_, and is fastened at\r\nits end to the cylinder, _y_. As there are thus six lines of chain, when\r\nthe plunger of the lifting cylinder comes 1 ft. out, 6 ft. of chain pass\r\nover the guide pulley, _u_. The plunger, when near the end of its stroke\r\nin either direction, is made to move a bar—not shown—which closes the\r\nvalve. When the crane is loaded, the load is lowered by simply opening\r\nthe exhaust-valve, when the lift-plunger will be forced back into its\r\ncylinder by the pull on the chain. But as the chain may require to be\r\nlowered when there is no load upon it, although a bob is provided at _z_\r\nto draw the chain down, it would be disadvantageous to increase the\r\nweight of this to the extent required for forcing back the lifting\r\nplunger. A _return_ cylinder is therefore made use of, the plunger of\r\nwhich has but a small diameter, and is connected with the head of the\r\nlift-plunger, so that it forces the latter back when the lift-cylinder\r\nis put in communication with the exhaust-pipe. The water is admitted to\r\nthe lifting cylinder from the accumulator by a valve worked by a lever,\r\nwhich, when moved the other way, closes the communication and opens the\r\nexhaust-pipe, and then the pressure in the return cylinder, which is\r\nconstant, drives in the plunger of the lifting cylinder. The principle\r\nof the accumulator may plainly be used with great advantage even when\r\nmanual labour is employed, for a less number of men will be required for\r\nworking the pumps to produce the effect than if their efforts had to be\r\napplied to the machine only at the time it is in actual operation, for\r\nin the intervals they would, in the last case, be standing idle.\r\nApparatus on the same plan has been used with advantage for opening and\r\nshutting dock gates, moving swing bridges, turn-tables, and for other\r\npurposes where a considerable power has to be occasionally applied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 169.—_Sir W. Armstrong’s Hydraulic Crane._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 170.—_Raising Tubes of the Britannia Bridge._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 171.—_Press for Raising the Tubes._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 172.—_Head of Link-Bars._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA famous example of the application of hydraulic power was the raising\r\nof the great tubes of the Britannia Bridge. As already stated, the tubes\r\nwere built on the shore, and were floated to the towers. This was done\r\nby introducing beneath the tubes a number of pontoons, provided with\r\nvalves in the bottom, so as to admit the water to regulate the height of\r\nthe tube according to the tide. The great tubes were so skilfully guided\r\ninto their position that they appeared to spectators to be handled with\r\nas much ease as small boats. The mode in which they were raised by the\r\nhydraulic presses wall be understood from Fig. 170, where A is one of\r\nthe presses and C the tube, supported by the chains, B. The tubes were\r\nsuspended in this manner at each end, and as the great tubes weighed\r\n1,800 tons, each press had, therefore, to lift half this weight, or 900\r\ntons. The ram or plunger of the pump was 1 ft. 8 in. in diameter, and\r\nthe cylinder in which it worked was 11 in. thick. Two steam engines,\r\neach 40 horse-power, were used to force the water into the cylinders.\r\nThese cylinders were themselves remarkable castings, for each contained\r\nno less than 22 tons of iron. Notwithstanding the great thickness of the\r\nmetal, an unfortunate accident occurred while the plungers were making\r\ntheir fourth ascent, for the bottom of one of the cylinders gave way—a\r\npiece of iron weighing nearly a ton and a half having been forced out,\r\nwhich, after killing a man who was ascending a rope ladder to the press,\r\nfell on the top of the tube 80 ft. below, and made in it a deep\r\nindentation. The accident occasioned a considerable delay in the\r\nprogress of the work, for a new cylinder had to be cast and fitted. Such\r\nan accident would assuredly have caused the destruction of the tube\r\nitself but for the foresight and prudence of the engineer in placing\r\nbeneath the ends of the vast tube as it ascended slabs of wood 1 in.\r\nthick, so that it was impossible for the tube to fall more than 1 in. It\r\nmust be stated that as the tube was lifted each step, the masonry was\r\nbuilt up from below, and then as the next lift proceeded inch by inch, a\r\nslab of wood was placed under the ends. Although by the giving way of\r\nthe cylinder of the hydraulic press the end of the tube fell through no\r\ngreater space than 1 in., the momentum was such that beams calculated to\r\nbear enormous weights were broken. At the time of the accident the\r\npressure in the cylinder did not exceed that which it was calculated to\r\nbear or that which is frequently applied in hydraulic presses for other\r\npurposes. Some scientific observers attributed the failure of the\r\ncylinder to the oscillating of the tube. It had been found when the\r\nsimilar tubes of the bridge over the Conway were being raised, that when\r\nthe engines at each end made their strokes simultaneously, a dangerous\r\nundulation was set up in the tube, and it was therefore necessary to\r\ncause the strokes of the engines to take place alternately. The chains\r\nby which the tubes were suspended were made of flat bars 7 in. wide and\r\nabout 1 in. thick, being rolled in one piece, with expanded portions\r\nabout the “eye,” through which the connecting-bolts pass. The links of\r\nthe chain consisted of nine and eight of these bars alternately—the bars\r\nof the eight-fold links being made a little thicker than those of the\r\nnine-fold, so as to have the same aggregate strength. The mode in which\r\nthe hydraulic presses were made to raise the tubes is very clearly\r\ndescribed by Sir William Fairbairn in his interesting work on the Conway\r\nand Britannia Bridges, and his account of the mode of raising the tubes\r\nis here given in his own words, but with letters referring to Fig. 171:\r\n“Another great difficulty was to be overcome, and it was one which\r\npresented itself to my mind with great force, viz., in what manner the\r\nenormous weight of the tube was to be kept suspended when lifted to the\r\nheight of 6 ft., the proposed travel of the pump, whilst the ram was\r\nlowered and again attached for the purpose of making another lift. Much\r\ntime was occupied in scheming means for accomplishing this object, and\r\nafter examining several projects, more or less satisfactory, it at last\r\noccurred to me that, by a particular formation of the links (of the\r\nchain by which the tubes were to be suspended) we might make the chains\r\nthemselves support the tube. I proposed that the lower part of the top\r\nof each link, immediately below the eye, should be formed with square\r\nshoulders cut at right angles to the body of the link (Fig. 172). When\r\nthe several links forming the chain E were put together, these shoulders\r\nformed a bearing surface, or “hold,” for the crosshead B attached to the\r\ntop of the ram A of the hydraulic pump. But the upper part of this\r\ncrosshead, C C, was movable, or formed of clips, which fitted the\r\nshoulders of the chain, and were worked by means of right- and\r\nleft-handed screws, and could be made either to clip the chain\r\nimmediately under the shoulders when the ram of the pump was down and a\r\nlift about to be made, or be withdrawn at pleasure. Attached to the\r\nlarge girders F were a corresponding set of clips, D D, which were so\r\nplaced and adjusted as to height that when the ram of the pump was at\r\nthe top there was distance between the two sets of clips equal to twice\r\nthe length of the travel of the pump, or the length of the two sets of\r\nthe links of the chain. To render the action of the apparatus more\r\nclear, suppose the tube resting on the shelf of masonry in the position\r\nthat it was left in after the operation of floating was completed, and\r\nthe chains attached, and everything ready for the first lift, the ram of\r\nthe pump being necessarily down. The upper set of clips attached to the\r\ncrosshead are forced under the shoulders of the links, and the lower set\r\nof clips attached to the frames resting upon the girders are drawn back,\r\nso as to be quite clear of the chain; the pumps are put into action\r\nsimultaneously at both ends of the tube, and the whole mass is slowly\r\nraised until it has reached a height of 6 ft. from its original\r\nresting-place. The clips attached to the crosshead, B, have so far been\r\nsustaining the weight, but it will be observed that by the time the pump\r\nhas ascended to its full travel, the square shoulders of another set of\r\nlinks have come opposite to the lower clips on the girders, D, and these\r\nclips are advanced under the shoulders of the links, and the rams being\r\nallowed to descend a little, they in their turn sustain the load and\r\nrelieve the pumps. The upper clips being withdrawn, the rams are allowed\r\nto descend, and after another attachment, a further lift of 6 ft. is\r\naccomplished; and thus, by a series of lifts, any height may be\r\nattained. The fitness of this apparatus for its work was admirable, and\r\nthe action of the presses was, as Mr. Stephenson termed it, delightful.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 173.—_Apparatus to prove Transmission of Pressure in all\r\n    directions._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 174.—_Pneumatic Tubes and Carriages._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PNEUMATIC DISPATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the use of the electric telegraph became general, it was found\r\nnecessary to establish in all large towns branch stations, from which\r\nmessages were conveyed to the central station, or to which they were\r\nsent, either by messengers who carried the written despatch, or by\r\ntelegraphing between the central and branch stations. The latter had the\r\ndisadvantages of rendering the original message liable to an additional\r\nchance of incorrect transmission, and when an unusually great number of\r\ndespatches had to be sent to or from a particular branch station, there\r\nwas necessarily great delay in the forwarding of them. The plan of\r\nsending the written messages between the central stations by bearers was\r\nunsatisfactory on account of the time occupied. These inconveniences led\r\nto the invention of a system for propelling, by the pressure of air, the\r\npapers upon which the messages were written through tubes connecting the\r\nstations. This was first carried into practice by the Electric and\r\nInternational Telegraph Company, who, in this way, connected their\r\ncentral station in London with their City branch stations. The apparatus\r\nwas designed and erected by Mr. L. Clark and Mr. Varley in 1854. The\r\nfirst tube laid down was from Lothbury and the Stock Exchange—a distance\r\nof 220 yards. This tube had an inside diameter of only 1½ in.; but a\r\nlarger tube, having a diameter of 2¼ in. was, some years afterwards,\r\nlaid between Telegraph Street and Mincing Lane—a distance of 1,340\r\nyards—and was used successfully. In these tubes the carriers were pushed\r\nforward by the pressure of the atmosphere, a vacuum having been produced\r\nin front by pumping out the air. The plan of propelling the carrier by\r\ncompressing the air behind it was also tried with good results, and, in\r\nfact, with a gain of speed; for, while a carrier occupied 60 or 70\r\nseconds in passing from Telegraph Street to Mincing Lane when drawn by a\r\nvacuum, it accomplished its journey in 50 or 55 seconds when it was shot\r\nforwards by compressed air, the difference in pressure before and behind\r\nit being the same in each case. A great deal of trouble was occasioned\r\nwhen the vacuum system was used, by water being drawn in at the joints\r\nof the pipes. This water sometimes accumulated to such a degree,\r\nespecially after wet weather, that it completely overcame the power of\r\nthe vacuum to draw the air through it, by lodging in the vertical\r\nportions of the tube, where they passed to the upper floors of the\r\ncentral station. This was remedied by improving the construction of the\r\njoints, and by arranging a syphon for drawing off any water which might\r\nbe present. The best construction of the carrier was another matter\r\nwhich required some experience to discover. It was found that\r\ngutta-percha, or papier maché covered with felt, was the most efficient\r\nmaterial. The tubes found by Mr. Varley to give the best results were\r\nformed of lead covered externally with iron pipes. The joints were made\r\nperfectly smooth in the inside by means of a heated steel mandrel, on\r\nwhich they were formed, so that the tube was of one perfectly uniform\r\nbore throughout. An ingenious arrangement was also adopted by which the\r\nair itself was made to do the work of opening and closing the valves,\r\nand even that of removing the carrier from the tube: when, by a\r\ntelegraphic bell, rung from the distant station, it was announced that a\r\ncarrier was dispatched, the attendant at the receiving station had only\r\nto touch for a second a knob marked “receive,” which put the tube in\r\ncommunication with the vacuum, in which condition it remained until the\r\narrival of the carrier, which, by striking against a pad of\r\nindia-rubber, released the detent, and thus cut off the vacuum. The\r\ncarrier then fell out of the receiver and dropped into a box placed to\r\ncatch it. When a carrier was sent, it was placed in the tube, and a\r\nbutton marked “send” was touched, by which a communication was opened\r\nwith a vessel of compressed air and the end of the tube behind the\r\ncarrier was immediately closed by a slide, the movements being all\r\nperformed by the air itself. On the arrival of the carrier, the boy at\r\nthe receiving station rang an electric bell to signal its reception; and\r\nthe sender then touched another knob marked “cut off,” which caused the\r\nsupply of compressed air to be cut off, and the slide to be withdrawn\r\nfrom the end of the tube, which was then ready either to receive or send\r\ncarriers. By this arrangement there was no waste of power, for the\r\nreservoirs of compressed air or of vacuum were only drawn upon when the\r\nwork was actually required to be done.\r\n\r\nThe tubes laid down by the Telegraph Company are still in active\r\noperation; but at the new Central Telegraph Station the automatic valves\r\nof Messrs. Clark and Varley appear to be dispensed with, and the\r\nattendants perform the work of closing the tube, shutting off the\r\ncompressed air, &c., by a few simple movements.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1869, Messrs. Siemens were commissioned by the\r\nPostmaster-General to lay tubes on their system from the General Post\r\nOffice to the Central Telegraph Station; and the work having been\r\naccomplished in February, 1870, and proving perfectly satisfactory after\r\nsix weeks’ trial, it was decided to connect in the same manner Fleet\r\nStreet and the West Strand office at Charing Cross with the Central\r\nStation. The system proposed by the Messrs. Siemens consisted in forming\r\na circuit of tubes, through which the carriers might be continually\r\npassing in one direction. The diagram, Fig. 175, will give an idea of\r\nthe manner in which it was designed to arrange the tubes between the\r\nCentral Telegraph Station and Charing Cross. The arrows indicate the\r\ndirection in which the air rushes through the tubes; A is the piston in\r\nthe cylinder, and valves are so arranged as to pump air out of the\r\nchamber V, and compress it into the chamber P. This plan has been\r\ndeparted from, so far as regards the Charing Cross Station, for want of\r\nspace there prevented the tube being curved with a radius large enough\r\nto convey the carriers without their being liable to stick, and\r\nconsequently, these are not carried round in the tube. The passage of\r\ncarriers being stopped here, there are, in point of fact, two tubes: an\r\n“up” tube and a “down” tube. But these are connected by a sharp bend, so\r\nthat though the tube is continuous as regards the air current, it is\r\ninterrupted as regards the circulation of the carriers. The tubes are of\r\niron, 3 in. internal diameter, made in lengths of about 19 ft.; and for\r\nthe turns and bends, pieces are curved with a radius of 12 ft. Both\r\nlines are laid side by side in a trench at about a foot depth below the\r\nstreets. The ends of the adjacent lengths form butt joints, so that the\r\ninternal surface is interrupted as little as possible, and there is a\r\ndouble collar to fasten the lengths together. Arrangements are also made\r\nfor removing from the inside of the tubes water or dirt, or matter which\r\nmay in any manner have got in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 175.—_Diagram of Tubes, &c._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 176.—_Sending and Receiving Apparatus.—Transverse Section._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne special feature of Messrs. Siemens’ invention is the plan by which\r\nthe carriers are introduced into and removed from the tube at any\r\nrequired station without the circulation of the air being interfered\r\nwith. The simple yet ingenious mechanism by which this is effected will\r\nbe understood from the sections shown in Figs. 176 and 177. The figures\r\nrepresent the position of the apparatus when placed to receive a\r\ncarrier; A´ is the receptacle into which the carrier is shot by the air\r\nrushing from A towards A´´. This receptacle is ᗜ-shaped, the curve of\r\nthe Ⅾ corresponding with that of the tube, and the upper flat part\r\nadmitting of a piece of plate glass being inserted, through which the\r\nattendant may perceive when a carrier arrives. The progress of the\r\ncarrier is arrested by a perforated plate, B, which allows the air to\r\npass. The ends of this receptacle are fixed in two parallel plates, F\r\nF´, which also receive the ends of the plain cylinder, having precisely\r\nthe same diameter as the tube, A. These plates are connected also by\r\ncross-pieces, D E, the whole forming a sort of frame, which turns upon E\r\nas a centre; and according as it is put in the position shown by the\r\nplain line in Fig. 176, or in that indicated by the dotted lines, causes\r\nthe receiving tube or the hollow cylinder to form part of the main tube,\r\nthe cross-piece, D, serving as a handle for moving the apparatus. It\r\nshould be remarked that the plates are made to fit the space cut out of\r\nthe main tube with great nicety, otherwise much loss of power would\r\nresult from leakage. When the hollow cylinder is in a line with the main\r\ntube, it is plain that the carrier will not be stopped, as the tube is\r\nthen continuous and uninterrupted. In this hollow cylinder also the\r\ncarrier to be sent is deposited after the rocking frame has been placed\r\non it, Fig. 177; then, on drawing the handle, the hollow cylinder is\r\nbrought into the circuit, and the carrier at once shoots off. To stop a\r\ncarrier, the receiving-tube is put in by another movement of the handle,\r\nand when the carrier arrives, it is removed by bringing the open\r\ncylinder, or _through tube_, into the circuit, and thus making the\r\nreceiver ready for having the carrier pushed out of it by a rod which is\r\nmade to slide out by moving a handle. In order to avoid the obstruction\r\nto the movement of the air which would be caused by the carrier while in\r\nthe receiving-tube, a pipe, G, is provided, through which the air\r\nchiefly passes when the perforations of the plate, B, are closed by the\r\npresence of a carrier. In this pipe at H is a throttle-valve, which is\r\nopened by tappets, K, on the rocking frames when the receiver is in\r\ncircuit, and again closed when the open tube is substituted. The current\r\nthus suffers no interruption by the action of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 177.—_Receiving Apparatus.—Longitudinal Section._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe carriers are small cylinders of gutta-percha, or papier maché,\r\nclosed at one end, and provided with a lid at the other. They are\r\ncovered with felt or leather, and at the front they are furnished with a\r\nthick disc of drugget or leather, like the leathers of a common\r\nwater-pump, but fitting quite loosely in the tube. Such a carrier, being\r\nplaced in the tube at the Central Station, Fig. 175, will be carried by\r\nthe current in the direction of the arrows to the Charing Cross Station,\r\nwhere its progress will be interrupted; but according to the original\r\nplan it would continue its journey until it again reached the Central\r\nStation, where it would be intercepted by the diaphragm, Fig. 175. But\r\nthe carrier is stopped, if at any station the receiving-tube is placed\r\nin circuit, and this is done when an electric signal indicates to the\r\nstation that a carrier intended for it has been dispatched. The tubes\r\nare worked on the “block system,” that is, each section is known to be\r\nclear before a carrier is allowed to enter it, and a bell is provided,\r\nwhich is struck by a little lever, moved by each carrier in its passage\r\nthrough, so that the attendant at each station knows when a carrier has\r\nshot along the “through tube” of the station. This mode of working the\r\ntubes renders the liability to accidents much less, but their carrying\r\npower might be increased by dispatching carriers at regular and very\r\nshort intervals of time, when the limit would be only in the ability of\r\nthe attendants to receive a carrier and open the circuit in sufficient\r\ntime to allow the next following one to proceed without stoppage. The\r\nlength of the lines of tube laid down on this system, with the times\r\nrequired for the carriers to traverse them, are stated below, the\r\npressure and the vacuum being respectively equal to the absolute\r\npressures of 22 lbs. and 5½ lbs. on each square inch of the reservoirs\r\nduring the experiments:\r\n\r\n        ┌────────────────────────────────────────┬──────┬──────┐\r\n        │                                        │Yards.│M.

In this case the vacuum was\r\nmaintained, so that the air was constantly in movement; but when the\r\nexperiment was tried by allowing the air in the tube to become\r\nstationary, placing a carrier at one end, and then opening communication\r\nwith the vacuum reservoir at the other, the carrier required 13½ minutes\r\nto complete the journey. This is explained by the fact of the greater\r\npart of the air having to be exhausted from the tube before the carrier\r\ncould be set in motion.\r\n\r\nThe utility and advantage of the pneumatic system is well seen when its\r\npowers are compared with the wires. Thus, a single carrier, which may\r\ncontain, say, twenty-seven messages, can be sent every eight minutes;\r\nand since not more than one message per minute could be transmitted by\r\ntelegraph wire, even by the smartest clerks, the real average being\r\nabout two minutes for each message, it follows that only four messages\r\ncould be sent in the time required for a single carrier to traverse the\r\nup tube, and to do the work which could be done by the tube seven wires\r\nand fourteen clerks would be required.\r\n\r\nMr. R. S. Culley, the official telegraph engineer, states as his\r\nexperience of the relative wear and tear of the carriers in these iron\r\ntubes and in the smooth lead tubes, that it had been found necessary to\r\nrenew the felt covering of eighty-two dozen of the carriers used for\r\nthree months in the iron tubes, while in the same period only\r\nthirty-eight dozen of those used in the lead tubes required to be\r\nrecovered. The numbers of carriers sent and received by the pneumatic\r\ntubes on the 21st of November, 1871, between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., were:\r\n\r\n                     Iron tubes             │  135\r\n\r\n                     2¼ in. lead tubes 1,170│\r\n                                            │1,697\r\n                     1½ in. lead tubes   527│\r\n\r\nThe mileage of the carriers sent was much greater in the lead than in\r\nthe iron pipes, although the total lengths of each kind were\r\nrespectively 5,974 yards and 6,826 yards. The result is remarkable, as\r\nshowing the effect of apparently slight differences when their operation\r\nis summed up by numerous repetitions.\r\n\r\nThe circuit at Charing Cross having been divided on account of the\r\ndifficulty mentioned above, the tubes act as separate pipes—one for “up”\r\ntraffic (_i.e._, to Central Telegraph Station), the other for “down”\r\n(_i.e._, from the Central Station). The air, however, still accomplishes\r\na circuit, being exhausted at one end and compressed at the other. A\r\nvery noticeable and curious difference is found between the times\r\nrequired by the carriers to perform the “up” and the “down” journeys:\r\n\r\n                 An “up” carrier requires   6·5 minutes\r\n                 A “down” carrier requires 12·5 minutes\r\n                                           ————\r\n                         Together          19·0 minutes\r\n\r\nWhen two pipes were separated at Charing Cross so that the air no longer\r\ncirculated from one to the other, but both were left open to the\r\natmosphere, while the “up” pipe was worked by a vacuum only and the\r\n“down” pipe by pressure only, the times were for\r\n\r\n                     An “up” carrier   8·5 minutes\r\n                     A “down” carrier 11·3 minutes\r\n                                      ————\r\n                         Together     19·8 minutes\r\n\r\nThe time, therefore, for the whole circuit was practically the\r\nsame—whether the tubes were worked by a continuous current of air or\r\nseparated, and one worked by the vacuum and the other by pressure. It\r\nwas also seen that when the tubes were connected so that the air current\r\nwas continuous, and the pump producing a vacuum at one end and a\r\ncompression at the other, the neutral point where the pressure was equal\r\nto that of the atmosphere was not found midway between the two\r\nextremities—that is, at Charing Cross Station—but much nearer the vacuum\r\nend. When the tubes were disconnected, it appeared, as already shown by\r\nthe figures given above, that there was a gain of speed on the down\r\njourney, and a loss of speed on the up journey; and as the requirements\r\nof the traffic happened to require greater dispatch for the down\r\njourneys, the tubes have been worked in this manner.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to convey letters by pneumatic dispatch between the\r\nGeneral and Suburban Post Offices, and the Post Office authorities have\r\neven consulted engineers on the practicability of sending the Irish\r\nmails from London to Holyhead by this system. It was calculated,\r\nhowever, that although the scheme could be carried out, the proportion\r\nof expense for great speeds and long distances would be enormously\r\nincreased. A speed of 130 miles per hour was considered attainable, but\r\nthe wear and tear of the carriers would be extremely great at this high\r\nvelocity, and it was considered doubtful whether this circumstance might\r\nnot operate seriously against the practical carrying out of the plan.\r\nThe prime cost would be very great, for the steam power alone which\r\nwould be requisite would amount to 390 horse-power for every four miles.\r\nWe thus see that very high velocities would introduce a new order of\r\ndifficulties in the practical working. The case as regards the velocity\r\nwith which electric signals can be sent round the world is very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nAn amusing hoax appears to have been perpetrated by some waggish\r\ntelegraph clerk on an American gentleman at Glasgow, with regard to the\r\npneumatic system of sending messages; for the gentleman sent to the\r\n“Boston Transcript” a letter, in which he relates that having sent a\r\ntelegraphic message from Glasgow to London, he received in a few minutes\r\na reply which indicated a mistake somewhere, and then he went to the\r\nGlasgow telegraph office, and asked to see his message.\r\n\r\n“The clerk said, ‘We can’t show it to you, as we have sent it to\r\nLondon.’ ‘But,’ I replied, ‘you must have my original paper here. I wish\r\nto see that.’ He again said, ‘No, we have not got it: it is in the post\r\noffice at London.’ ‘What do you mean?’ I asked. ‘Pray, let me see the\r\npaper I left here half an hour ago.’ ‘Well,’ said he, ‘if you must see\r\nit, we will get it back in a few minutes, but it is now in London.’ He\r\nrang a bell, and in five minutes or so produced my message, rolled up in\r\npasteboard.... I inquired if I might see a message sent. ‘Oh, yes; come\r\nround here.’ He slipped a number of messages into the pasteboard scroll,\r\npopped it into the tube, and made a signal. I put my ear to the tube and\r\nheard a slight rumbling noise for seventeen seconds, when a bell rang\r\nbeside me, indicating that the scroll had arrived at the General Post\r\nOffice, 400 miles off. It almost took my breath away to think of it.”\r\n\r\nIn the journal called “Engineering,” into which this curious letter was\r\ncopied, it is pointed out that to travel from London to Glasgow, a\r\ndistance of 405 miles, in seventeen seconds, the carrier must have moved\r\nat the rate of 24 miles per second, or 5 miles a second faster than the\r\nearth moves in its orbit, and the carrier would have in such a case\r\nbecome red hot by its friction against the tube before it had travelled\r\na single second.\r\n\r\nA plan of conveying, not telegraph messages, but parcels, was proposed\r\nand carried into effect some time ago, and more recently has been\r\napplied to lines of tubes in connection with the General Post Office.\r\nThese tubes pass from Euston Station down Drummond Street, Hampstead\r\nRoad, Tottenham Court Road, to Broad Street, St. Giles’s, whence, with a\r\nsharp bend, they proceed to the Engine Station at Holborn, and then to\r\nthe Post Office. The tube is formed chiefly of cast iron pipes of a\r\n⌓-shaped section, 4 ft. 6 in. wide and 4 ft. high, in 9 ft. lengths.\r\nThere are curves with radii of 70 ft. and upwards, and at these parts\r\nthe tube is made of brickwork and not of iron. The carriages run on four\r\nwheels, and are so constructed that the ends fit the tubes nearly, and\r\nthe interval left is partly closed by a projecting sheet of india-rubber\r\nall round. The carriages are usually sent through the tube in trains of\r\ntwo or three, and the trains are drawn forward by an exhausting\r\napparatus formed by a fan, 22 ft. in diameter, worked by two horizontal\r\nsteam engines having cylinders 24 in. in diameter and a stroke of 20 in.\r\nThe air rushes by centrifugal force from the circumference of the fan,\r\nand is drawn in at the centre, where the exhaust effect is produced. The\r\ntubes which convey the air from the main tube open into the latter at\r\nsome distance from its extremities, which are closed by doors, so that\r\nafter the carriage passes the entrance of the suction tube, its momentum\r\nis checked by the air included between it and the doors, which air is,\r\nof course, compressed by the forward movement of the carriage. At the\r\nproper moment the doors are opened by a self-acting arrangement, and the\r\ncarriage emerges from the tube. There are two lines of tube—an “up” and\r\na “down” line—and means are provided for rapidly transferring the\r\ncarriages from one to the other at the termini. The time occupied in the\r\ntransit is about 12 minutes. Some of the inclines have as much slope as\r\n1 in 14, yet loads of 10 or 12 tons weight are drawn up these gradients\r\nwithout difficulty. The mails are sent between Euston Station and the\r\nPost Office by means of these tubes. Passengers have also made the\r\njourney as an experiment by lying down in the carriages. Fig. 174 shows\r\none of the carriages and the entrance to the tubes.\r\n\r\nGreat expectations have been formed by some persons of the applications\r\nof pneumatic force. Some have suggested its use for moving the trains in\r\nthe proposed tunnel between England and France. But calculations show\r\nthat for long distances and large areas such modes of imparting motion\r\nare enormously wasteful of power. Thus, in the tunnel alluded to it must\r\nbe remembered that not only the train, but the whole mass of air in the\r\ntunnel would have to be drawn or pushed forward. The drawing of a train\r\nthrough by exhausting the air would be very similar to drawing it\r\nthrough by a rope; in fact, the mass of air may be regarded as a very\r\nelastic rope, but by no means a very light one, or one that could be\r\ndrawn through without some opposing force which has a certain\r\nresemblance to friction coming into operation. Indeed, it has been\r\ncalculated that in the case named, only five per cent. of the total\r\npower exerted by the engines in exhausting the air could possibly\r\nproduce a useful effect in moving the train.\r\n\r\nAir has also been made the medium for conveying intelligence in another\r\nmanner than by shooting written messages through tubes, for its property\r\nof transmitting pressure has been applied to produce at a distance\r\nsignals like those made use of in the electric telegraph system. A few\r\nyears ago, an apparatus for this object was contrived by Signor\r\nGuattari, whose invention is known as the “Guattari Atmospheric\r\nTelegraph.” In this there is a vessel charged with compressed air by a\r\ncompression-pump, and the pressure is maintained by the same means,\r\nwhile the reservoir is being drawn upon. A valve is so arranged that the\r\nmanipulator can readily admit the compressed air to a tube extending to\r\nthe station where the signals are received, at which the pressure is\r\nmade to move a piston as often as the sender opens the valve. This\r\nmovement is made to convey intelligence when a duly regulated succession\r\nof impulses is sent into the tube—the receiving apparatus being arranged\r\neither to give visible or audible signals, or to print them on slips of\r\npaper, according to any of the methods in use with the electric\r\ntelegraph. Certain advantages over the electric system are claimed for\r\nthis pneumatic telegraph—as, for example, greater simplicity and less\r\nliability to derangement. The tubes, which are merely leaden piping of\r\nsmall bore, are also exempt from the inconvenient interruptions which\r\nelectric communication sometimes suffers from electrical disturbances in\r\nthe atmosphere. The pneumatic system is easily arranged, and from its\r\ngreat simplicity any person can in a few hours learn to use the whole\r\napparatus, while it is calculated that the expense of construction and\r\nworking would not be above half of that incurred for the electric\r\nsystem. For telegraphs in houses, ships, warehouses, and short lines,\r\nthis invention will doubtless prove very serviceable; but for long lines\r\na much greater force of compression would be required, and the time\r\nneeded for the production of an impulse at the distant ends of the tubes\r\nwould be considerably increased. [1875].\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 178.—_The Sommeiller Boring Machines._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ROCK BORING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to one great characteristic of our age,\r\nnamely, the replacement, in every department of industry, of manual\r\nlabour by machines. A brief notice of even the main features of the\r\nvarious contrivances which have been made to take the place of men’s\r\nhands would more than occupy this volume. Accordingly, we must omit all\r\nreference to many branches of manufacture, although the products may be\r\nof very great utility, and the processes of very high interest; and in\r\ntaking one example here and another there, we must be guided mainly by\r\nthe extent and depth of the influence which the new invention appears\r\ndestined to exert. This consideration has, with scarcely an exception,\r\ndecided the selection of the topics already discussed, and it has also\r\ndetermined the introduction of the present article, which relates to\r\nmachines of no less general importance than the rest, although at first\r\nsight it might seem to enter upon the details of merely a special branch\r\nof industry. But so general are the interests connected with the subject\r\nwe are about to lay before our readers, that we are not sure it would\r\nnot have been more logical to have placed the present article before all\r\nthe rest. For whence comes the iron of which our steam engines, tools,\r\nrails, ships, cannon, bridges, and printing presses are made?—whence\r\ncomes the fuel which supplies force to the engines?—whence come, in\r\nfine, the substances which form the _matériel_ of every art? Plainly\r\nfrom the earth—the nurse and the mother of all, and in most cases from\r\nthe bowels of the earth, for her treasures are hidden far below the\r\nsurface—the coal, and the ores of iron and other metals, are not ready\r\nto our hand, exposed to the light of day. The railways also, and the\r\ncanals, can be made only on condition that we cut roads through the\r\nsolid rocks, and pierce with tunnels the towering mountains. Hence the\r\ntools which enable us to penetrate into the substance of the earth\r\npresent the highest general interest from a practical point of view, and\r\nthis interest is enhanced by the knowledge of the structure and past\r\nhistory of our planet acquired in such operations.\r\n\r\nThe operations by which solid rocks are penetrated in the sinking of\r\nshafts for mines, or in the driving of tunnels, drifts, headings,\r\ngalleries, or cuttings for railways, mines, or other works, are easily\r\nunderstood. In the first place a number of holes—perhaps 3 ft. or 4 ft.\r\ndeep and 2 in. or 3 in. in diameter—are formed in the rock. The holes\r\nare then charged with gunpowder or other explosive materials, a\r\nslow-burning match is adjusted, the miners retire to a safe distance,\r\nthe explosion takes place—detaching, shattering, and loosening masses of\r\nthe rock more or less considerable; and then gangs of workmen clear away\r\nthe stones and _débris_ which have been detached by the explosion, and\r\nthe same series of operations is renewed. The holes for the blasting\r\ncharges are formed by giving repeated blows on the rock with a kind of\r\nchisel called a _jumper_—the end of which is formed of very hard steel,\r\nso that the rock is in reality chipped away. The _débris_ resulting from\r\nthis operation is cleared away from time to time by a kind of auger or\r\nsome similar contrivance. But for many purposes it is necessary to drill\r\nholes in rocks to great depths, hundreds of feet perhaps, as for\r\nexample, in order to ascertain the nature of underlying strata, or to\r\nverify the presence of coal or other minerals before the expense of\r\nsinking a shaft is incurred. These bore-holes were commonly formed in\r\nexactly the same manner as the blast-holes already mentioned, by\r\nrepeated blows of a chisel or jumper, which was attached to the end of a\r\nrod; and as the hole deepened, additional lengths of rod were joined on,\r\nand the rods were withdrawn from time to time to admit of the removal of\r\nthe _débris_ by augers, or by cylinders having a valve at the bottom.\r\nThe reciprocating movement is given to the chisels and rods either by\r\nhand or by steam or water power. When the length of the rods becomes\r\nconsiderable, of course the difficulty of giving the requisite blows in\r\nrapid succession is greatly increased, for the whole length of rods has\r\nto be lifted each time, and if allowed to fall with too much violence,\r\nthe breaking of the chisel or the rods is the inevitable result. The\r\ntime requisite for drawing out the rods, removing the fragments chipped\r\nout, and again attaching the rods and lowering, also increases very much\r\nas the bore gets deeper. Messrs. Mather and Platt, the Manchester\r\nengineers, have, in order to obviate these difficulties, constructed\r\nmachines in which the chipping or cutting is done by the fall of a tool\r\nsuspended from a rope, the great advantage resulting from the\r\narrangement being the facility and rapidity with which the tools used\r\nfor the cutting and for the removal of the _débris_ are lowered to their\r\nwork and drawn up. It is necessary in using the jumper, whether in\r\ncutting blast-holes or bore-holes, to give the tool a slight turn after\r\neach blow, in order that the rock may be chipped off all round, and the\r\naction of the tool equalized. Many attempts have been made to drill\r\nrocks after the fashion in which iron is drilled—that is, by drilling\r\nproperly so called, in which the tool has a rapid rotary motion. But\r\neven in comparatively soft rock, it is found that no steel can\r\nsufficiently withstand the abrading action of the rock, for the tool\r\nbecomes quickly worn, and makes extremely slow progress. We shall have\r\npresently to return to the subject of bore-holes; but now let us turn\r\nour attention to an example which will illustrate the nature and\r\nadvantages of the machinery which has in recent times been applied to\r\nwork the jumpers by which the holes for blasting are formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _THE MONT CENIS TUNNEL._\r\n\r\nThe successful construction, by the direction of Napoleon, of a broad\r\nand easy highway from Switzerland into Italy, crossing the lofty Alps\r\namid the snows and glaciers of the Simplon, has justly been considered a\r\nfeat of skill redounding to the glory of its designers. But we have\r\nrecently witnessed a greater feat of engineering skill, for we have seen\r\nthe Alps conquered by the stupendous work known as the Mont Cenis\r\nTunnel. This tunnel is 7½ English miles in length; but it is not the\r\nmere length which has made the undertaking remarkable. The mountain\r\nwhich is pierced by the tunnel is formed entirely of hard rock, and what\r\nadded still more to the apparently impracticable character of the\r\nproposal when first announced was the circumstance that it was quite\r\nimpossible to sink vertical shafts, so that the work could not, as in\r\nthe usual process, be carried on at several points simultaneously, but\r\nmust necessarily be continued from the two extremities only, a\r\nrestriction which would occasion a vast loss of time and much expense,\r\nto say nothing of the difficulties of ventilating galleries of more than\r\nthree miles in length. The reader must bear in mind that the importance\r\nof this question of ventilation depends not simply on the renewing of\r\nthe air contaminated by the respiration of the workmen, but on the quick\r\nremoval of the noxious gases produced in the explosions of the blasting\r\ncharges. A work surrounded by such difficulties would probably have\r\nnever been attempted had not Messrs. Sommeiller and Co. invited the\r\nattention of engineers to an engine of their invention, worked by\r\ncompressed air, and capable of automatically working “jumpers” which\r\ncould penetrate the hardest rock. These rock-boring machines, having\r\nbeen examined by competent authorities in the year 1857, were pronounced\r\nso efficient that the execution of the long-spoken-of Alpine tunnel was\r\nat once resolved upon, and before the close of that year the work had\r\nactually been commenced, after a skilful and accurate survey of the\r\nproposed locality had been made, and the direction of the tunnel set\r\nout. The tunnel does not pass through Mont Cenis, although the post road\r\nfrom St. Michel to Susa passes over part of Mont Cenis, which gives its\r\nname to the pass. The mountain really pierced by the tunnel is known as\r\nthe Grand Vallon, and the tunnel passes almost exactly below its summit,\r\nbut at a depth the perpendicular distance of which is as nearly as\r\npossible one mile. The northern end of the tunnel is near a village\r\nnamed Fourneaux.\r\n\r\nPending the construction of the Sommeiller machines, and other machinery\r\nwhich was to supply the motive force, the work of excavation was\r\ncommenced at both ends, in 1857, in the ordinary manner, that is, by\r\nhand labour, and in 1858 surveys of the greatest possible accuracy were\r\nmeanwhile made, in order that the two tunnels might be directed so that\r\nthey would meet each other in the heart of the mountain. The reader will\r\nat once perceive that the smallest error in fixing on the direction of\r\nthe two straight lines which ought to meet each other would entail very\r\nserious consequences. The difficulties of doing this may be conceived\r\nwhen we remember that the stations were nearly 8 miles apart, separated\r\nby rugged mountains, in a region of snows, mists, clouds, and winds,\r\nover which the levels had to be taken, and a very precise triangulation\r\neffected. So successfully were these difficulties overcome, and so\r\naccurately were the measurements and calculations made, that the\r\njunction of the centre lines of the completed tunnel failed by only a\r\n_few inches_, a length utterly insignificant under the conditions.\r\n\r\nThe work was carried on by manual labour only, until the beginning of\r\n1861, for it was found, on practically testing the machinery, that many\r\nimportant modifications had to be made before it could be successfully\r\nemployed in the great work for which it was designed. After the\r\nmachinery had been set to work, at the Bardonnêche end, breakages and\r\nimperfections of various parts of the apparatus, or the contrivances for\r\ndriving it, caused delay and trouble, so that during the whole of 1861\r\nthe machines were in actual operation for only 209 days, and the\r\nprogress made averaged only 18 in. per day, an advance much less than\r\ncould have been effected by manual labour. The engineers, not\r\ndisheartened or deterred by these difficulties and disappointments,\r\nencountered them by making improvement after improvement in the\r\nmachinery as experience accumulated, so that a wonderful difference in\r\nthe rate of progress showed itself in 1862, when the working days\r\nnumbered 325, and the average rate of advance was _three feet nine\r\ninches per day_.\r\n\r\nAt the Fourneaux extremity more time was required for the preparation of\r\nthe air-compressing machinery, and the machines had been at work in the\r\nother extremity, with more or less interruption, for nearly two years\r\nbefore the preparations at Fourneaux were completed.\r\n\r\nThe illustration at the head of this article, Fig. 178, represents the\r\nSommeiller machines at work, the motive power being compressed air,\r\nconveyed by tubes from receivers, into which it is forced until the\r\npressure becomes equal to that of six atmospheres, or 90 lbs. per square\r\ninch. The compression was effected by taking advantage of the natural\r\nheads of water, which were made to act directly in compressing the air;\r\nthe pressure due to a column of water 160 ft. high being made to act\r\nupwards, to compress air, and force it through valves into the\r\nreceivers; then the supply of water was cut off, and that which had\r\nrisen up into the vessel previously containing air was allowed to flow\r\nout, drawing in after it through another valve a fresh supply of air;\r\nand then the operations were repeated by the water being again permitted\r\nto compress the air, and so on, the whole of the movements being\r\nperformed by the machinery itself. The compressed air, after doing its\r\nwork in the cylinders of the boring tools, escaped into the atmosphere,\r\nand in its outrush became greatly cooled, a circumstance of the greatest\r\npossible advantage to the workmen, for otherwise, from the internal\r\nwarmth of the earth, and that produced by the burning of lights,\r\nexplosions of gunpowder, and respiration, the heat would have been\r\nintolerable. At the same time, the escaping air afforded a perfect\r\nventilation of the workings while the machines were in action. At other\r\ntimes, as after the explosion of the charges, it was found desirable to\r\nallow a jet of air to stream out, in order that the smoke and carbonic\r\nacid gas should be quickly cleared away. Even had the work been done by\r\nmanual labour alone, a plentiful supply of compressed air would have\r\nbeen required merely for ventilation, so that there was manifest\r\nadvantage in utilizing it as the motive power of the machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 179.—_Transit by Diligence over Mont Cenis._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe experience gained in the progress of the work suggested from time to\r\ntime many improvements in the machinery and appliances, which finally\r\nproved so effectual that the progress was accelerated beyond\r\nexpectation. At the end of 1864, when the machines had been in work\r\nabout four years, it was calculated that the opening of the tunnel might\r\nbe looked for in the course of the year 1875. But in point of fact it\r\nhappened that on the 25th December, 1870, perforator No. 45 bored a hole\r\nfrom Italy into France, by piercing the wall of rock, about 4 yards\r\nthick, which then separated the workings from each other. The centre\r\nlines of the two workings, as set out from the different sides of the\r\nmountain, failed to coincide by only a foot, that set out on the\r\nFourneaux side being this much higher than the other, but their\r\nhorizontal directions exactly agreeing. The actual length of the tunnel\r\nwas found to be some 15 yards longer than the calculated length, the\r\ncalculation having given 7·5932 miles for the length, whereas by actual\r\nmeasurement it was found to be 7·6017 miles. The heights above the\r\nsea-level of the principal points are these:\r\n\r\n                                                            Feet.\r\n       Fourneaux, or northern entrance                      3,801\r\n       Bardonnêche, or southern entrance                    4,236\r\n       Summit of tunnel                                     4,246\r\n       Highest point of mountain vertically over the tunnel 9,527\r\n\r\nThe tunnel is lined with excellent brick and stone arching, and it is\r\nconnected with the railways on either side by inclined lines, which are\r\nin part tunnelled out of the mountain, so that the extremities of the\r\ntunnel referred to above are not really entered by the trains at all;\r\nbut these lateral tunnels join the other and increase the total distance\r\ntraversed underground to very nearly 8 miles, or more accurately, 7·9806\r\nmiles. The time required by a train to pass from one side to the other\r\nis about 25 minutes. What a contrast is this to the old transit over the\r\nMont Cenis pass by “diligence”! We have the scene depicted in Fig. 179,\r\nwhere we perceive, sliding down or toiling up the steep zigzag ascents,\r\na series of curious vehicles drawn by horses with perpetually jingling\r\nbells.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the Mont Cenis Tunnel was about £3,000,000 sterling, or\r\nupwards of £200 per yard; but as a result of the experience gained in\r\nthis gigantic work, engineers consider that a similar undertaking could\r\nnow be carried out for half this cost. It is supposed that the profit to\r\nthe contractors for the Mont Cenis Tunnel was not much less than £100\r\nper yard. The greatest number of men directly employed on the tunnel at\r\none time was 4,000, and the total horse-power of the machinery amounted\r\nto 860. From 1857 to 1860, by hand labour alone, 1,646 metres were\r\nexcavated; from 1861 to 1870 the remaining 10,587 metres were completed\r\nby the machines. The most rapid progress made was in May, 1865, in which\r\nmonth the tunnel was driven forward at one end the length of 400 feet.\r\nWhen the workings were being carried through quartz, a very hard rock,\r\nthe speed was greatly reduced—as, for example, during the month of\r\nApril, 1866, when the machines could not accomplish more than 35 ft.\r\n\r\nThe perforators used in the Mont Cenis Tunnel were worked by compressed\r\nair, conveyed to a small cylinder, in which it works a piston, to the\r\nrod of which the jumper is directly attached. The air, being admitted\r\nbehind the piston, impels the jumper against the rock, and the tool is\r\nthen immediately brought back by the opening of a valve, which admits\r\ncompressed air in front of the piston, at the same time that the air\r\nwhich has driven it forward is allowed to escape, communication with the\r\nreservoir of compressed air having previously been closed behind it. The\r\nwhole of these movements are automatic, and they are effected in the\r\nmost rapid manner, four or five blows being struck in every second, or\r\nbetween two and three hundred in one minute. Water was constantly forced\r\ninto the holes, so as to remove the _débris_ as quickly as it was\r\nformed. A number of these machines were mounted on one frame, supported\r\non wheels, running on the tramway which was laid along the gallery. The\r\nperforators had no connection with each other, for each one had its own\r\ntube for the conveyance of compressed air, and its own tube to carry the\r\nwater used for clearing out the hole, and the cylinders were so fixed on\r\nthe frames that the jumpers could be directed in any desired manner\r\nagainst any selected portion of the rock. They were driven to an average\r\ndepth of about 2½ ft., and the process occupied from forty to fifty\r\nminutes. When a set of holes had thus been formed, the cylinders were\r\nshifted and another series commenced, until about eighty holes had been\r\nbored, the formation of the whole number occupying about six or seven\r\nhours, and the holes being so arranged that the next operation would\r\ndetach the rock to the required extent. The flexible tubes, which\r\nconveyed the air and water to the machines from the entrances, were then\r\nremoved from the machines and stowed away, the frame bearing the\r\nperforators was drawn back along the tramway, workmen advanced whose\r\nduty it was to wipe out the holes, charge them with powder, and fix the\r\nfuses ready for the explosion. When the slow-burning match was ignited,\r\nall retired behind strong wooden barricades, at a safe distance, until\r\nthe explosion had taken place; and after the compressed air had been\r\nallowed to stream into the working, so as to clear away all the smoke\r\nand gas generated by the explosion, the workmen ran up on a special\r\ntramway the waggons which were to carry away all the detached stones;\r\nand when this had been done, the floor was levelled, the tramways were\r\nlengthened, and the frame bearing the drilling machines was brought up\r\nto begin a fresh series of operations, which were usually repeated about\r\ntwice in the course of every twenty-four hours. A great part of the rock\r\nconsists of very hard calcareous schist, interspersed with veins of\r\nquartz, one of the hardest of all rocks, which severely tries the temper\r\nof the steel tools, for a few blows on quartz will not unfrequently\r\ncause the point of a jumper to snap off.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _ROCK-DRILLING MACHINES._\r\n\r\nSeveral forms of rock-drills, or perforators, have been constructed on\r\nthe same principle as that used in the Mont Cenis Tunnel, and a\r\ndescription of one of them will give a good notion of the general\r\nprinciple of all. We select a form devised by Mr. C. Burleigh, and much\r\nused in America, where it has been very successfully employed in driving\r\nthe Hoosac Tunnel, effecting a saving in the cost of the drilling\r\namounting to one-third of the expense of that operation, and effecting\r\nalso a still greater saving of time, for the tunnel, which is 5 miles in\r\nlength, is to be completed in four years, instead of twelve, as the\r\nmachines make an advance of 150 ft. per month, whereas the rate by hand\r\nlabour was only 49 ft. per month. These machines are known as the\r\n“Burleigh Rock Drills,” and have been patented in England for certain\r\nimprovements by Mr. T. Brown, who has kindly supplied us with the\r\nfollowing particulars:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 180.—_Burleigh Rock Drill on Tripod._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Burleigh perforator acts by repeated blows, like Bartlett and\r\nSommeiller’s, but its construction is more simple, and the machine is\r\nlighter and not half the size, while its action is even superior in\r\nrapidity and force. The Burleigh machines are composed of a single\r\ncylinder, the compressed air or steam acting directly on the piston,\r\nwithout the necessity of flywheel, gearing, or shafting. The regular\r\nrotation of the drills is obtained by means of a remarkably simple\r\nmechanical contrivance. This consists of two grooves, one rectilinear,\r\nthe other in the form of a spiral cut into the piston-rod. In each of\r\nthese channels, or grooves, is a pin, which works freely in their\r\ninterior: these pins are respectively fixed to a concentric ring on the\r\npiston-rod. A ratchet wheel holds the ring, and the pin slides into the\r\ncurve, causing it to turn always in the same direction, without being\r\nable to go back. By this eminently simple piece of mechanism, the\r\nregular rotation of the drill-holder is secured. The slide-valve is put\r\ninto motion by the action of a projection, or ball-headed piston-rod, on\r\na double curved momentum-piece, or trigger, which is attached to the\r\nslide-rod or spindle by a fork, thus opening and shutting the valve in\r\nthe ascent and descent of the piston. Fig. 180 represents one of the\r\nmachines attached in this instance by a clamp to the frame of a tripod.\r\nThe principal parts of the machine are the cylinder, with its piston,\r\nand the cradle with guide-ways, in which the cylinder travels. The\r\naction of the piston is similar to that of the ordinary steam hammer,\r\nwith this difference, that, in addition to the reciprocating, it has\r\nalso a rotary, motion. The drill-point is held in a slip-socket, or\r\nclamp, at the end of the piston-rod, by means of bolts and nuts. The\r\ndrill-point rotates regularly at each stroke of the piston, making a\r\ncomplete revolution in every eighteen strokes. For hard rocks it is\r\ngenerally made with four cutting edges, in the form of a St. Andrew’s\r\ncross, thus striking the rock in seventy-two places in one revolution,\r\neach cutting edge chipping off a little of the stone at each stroke in\r\nadvance of the one preceding. The jumper makes, on an average, 300 blows\r\nper minute, and such is the construction of the machine, that the blows\r\nare of an elastic, and not of a rigid, nature, thus preventing the\r\ndrill-point from being soon blunted. It has been found in practice, that\r\na drill-point used in the Burleigh machine can bore on an average 20 ft.\r\nof Aberdeen granite without re-sharpening. As the drill pierces the\r\nrock, the machine is fed down the guide-ways of the cradle by means of\r\nthe feed-screw (see Fig. 180), according to the nature of the rock and\r\nthe progress made. When the cylinder has been fed down the entire length\r\nof the feed-screw, and if a greater depth of hole is required, the\r\ncylinder is run back, and a longer drill is inserted in the socket at\r\nthe end of the piston-rod. The universal clamp may be attached to any\r\nform of tripod, carriage, or frame, according to the requirements of the\r\nwork to be done; it enables the machines to work vertically,\r\nhorizontally, or at any angle.\r\n\r\nThe following advantages are claimed for this machine: Any labourer can\r\nwork it; it combines strength, lightness, and compactness in a\r\nremarkable degree, is easily handled, and is not liable to get out of\r\norder. No part of the mechanism is exposed; it is all enclosed within\r\nthe cylinder, so there is no risk of its being broken. It is applicable\r\nto every form of rockwork, such as tunnelling, mining, quarrying, open\r\ncutting, shaft-sinking, or submarine drilling; and in hard rock, like\r\ngranite, gneiss, ironstone, or quartz, the machine will, according to\r\nsize, progress at the incredible rate of _four inches_ to _twelve inches\r\nper minute_, and bore holes from ¾ in. up to 5 in. diameter. It will, on\r\nan average, go through 120 ft. of rock per day, making forty holes, each\r\nfrom 2 ft. to 3 ft. deep, and it can be used at any angle and in any\r\ndirection, and will drill and clear itself to any depth up to 20 ft.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the “Times,” September 24th, 1873, gives an\r\naccount of some experiments with the machine, made at the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in that year, before the members of the Section of\r\nMechanical Science:\r\n\r\n“Yesterday, considerable interest was taken in this section, as it had\r\nbeen announced that a ‘Burleigh Rock Drilling Machine’ would be working\r\nduring the reading of a paper by Mr. John Plant. The machine was not,\r\nhowever, in the room, but was placed in the grounds outside, where it\r\nwas closely examined by the members after the adjournment, and seen in\r\nfull operation, boring into an enormous block of granite. The aspect of\r\nthe machine cannot be called formidable in any respect, for it looks\r\nlike a big garden syringe, supported upon a splendid tripod; but when at\r\nwork, under about 80 lbs. pressure of compressed air, it would be deemed\r\na very revolutionary agent indeed, against whose future power the\r\nadvocates for manual labour in the open quarry, the tunnel, and even the\r\ndeep mine, may well look aghast. Placed upon a block of granite a yard\r\ndeep, the machine was handled and its parts moved by the fair hands of\r\nmany of the lady associates of scientific proclivities; but once the\r\nsource of power was turned on, the drill began its poundings, eating\r\nholes 2 in. in diameter in the block of granite, and making a honeycomb\r\nof it as easily as a schoolboy would demolish a sponge cake. It pounds\r\naway at the rate of 300 strokes, and progresses forward about 12 in., in\r\nthe minute, making a complete revolution of the drill in eighteen\r\nstrokes, and keeping the hole free of the pounded rock. The machine was\r\nfixed to work at any angle, almost as readily as a fireman can work his\r\nhose; and its adaptation to a wide range of stone-getting, by drilling\r\nfor blasting, and cutting large blocks for building and engineering,\r\nwith a saving of capital and labour, was admitted by many members of the\r\nsection. The tool is called the ‘Burleigh Rock Drill,’ invented by Mr.\r\nCharles Burleigh, a gentleman hailing from Massachusetts, United States.\r\nThe patent is the property of Messrs. T. Brown and Co., of London. The\r\nprincipal feature of this new machine is, that it imitates in every way\r\nthe action of the quarryman in boring a hole in the rock.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 181.—_Burleigh Rock Drill on Movable Column._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany forms of carriages and supports have, from time to time, been made\r\nto suit the work for which the ‘Burleigh’ machines have been required.\r\nThe machine is attached to these carriages, or supports, by means of the\r\nuniversal clamp, by which it can be worked in any direction and at any\r\nangle. Of these carriages we select for notice only two forms, one of\r\nwhich is shown in Fig. 181. This carriage can be used to great advantage\r\nin adits and drifts. It consists of an upright column, with a screw\r\nclamp-nut for holding and raising or lowering the machine, the whole\r\nbeing mounted on a platform which can slide right across the carriage,\r\nand thus the machine can be brought to work on any point of a heading.\r\nIt is secured in position by means of a jack-screw in the top of the\r\ncolumn; and as the carriage is mounted on wheels, it is easily moved to\r\npermit of blasting. Fig. 182 represents a carriage which is the result\r\nof many years’ experience with mining machinery, and it is considered a\r\nvery perfect appliance. It is constructed of wood and iron, and it runs\r\non wheels. The supports for the machines, four of which may be mounted\r\nat once, are two horizontal bars, the lower of which can be raised or\r\nlowered, as may be necessary. The two parallel sides of the carriage are\r\njoined only at the upper side, and there is nothing to prevent it from\r\nbeing run into the heading, though the way between the rails may be\r\nheaped up with broken rock, if only the rails are clear. Drilling, and\r\nthe removal of the broken rock, may then proceed simultaneously; for, by\r\nmeans of a narrow gauge inside the carriage rails, small cars may be\r\ntaken right up to the _débris_. It is made in different sizes, to suit\r\nthe dimensions of the tunnel required. To give the carriage steadiness\r\nin working, it is raised from the wheels by jack-screws, and held in\r\nposition by screws in a similar manner to the carriage represented in\r\nFig. 181.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 182.—_Burleigh Rock Drills mounted on a Carriage._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 183.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn extremely interesting system of drilling rocks—totally different from\r\nthat on which the machines we have just described are constructed—has,\r\nwithin the last few years, been introduced by Messrs. Beaumont and\r\nAppleby. What does the reader think of boring holes in rocks with\r\ndiamonds? It has long been a matter of common knowledge that the diamond\r\nis the hardest of all substances, and that it will scratch and wear down\r\nany other substances, while it cannot itself be scratched or worn by\r\nanything but diamond. In respect to wearing down or abrading hard\r\nstones, the diamond, according to experiments recently made by Major\r\nBeaumont, occupies a position over all other gems and minerals to a\r\ndegree far beyond that which has been generally attributed to it; for in\r\nthese experiments it was found that on applying a diamond, or rather a\r\npiece of the “carbonate” about to be described, fixed in a suitable\r\nholder, to a grindstone in rapid rotation, the grindstone was quickly\r\nworn down; but on repeating a similar experiment with sapphires and with\r\ncorundum, it was these which were worn down by the grindstone. Without,\r\non the present occasion, entering into the natural history of the\r\ndiamond, we may say that there are, besides the pure colourless\r\ntransparent crystals so highly prized as gems, several varieties of\r\ndiamond, and that those which are tinged with pink, blue, or yellow, are\r\nfar from having the same value for the jeweller. Then there is another\r\nimpure variety called _boort_, which appears to be employed only to\r\nfurnish a powder by which the brilliants are ground and polished. In the\r\ndiamond gravels of Brazil, from which we derive our regular supply of\r\nthese gems, there was discovered in 1842 a curious variety of\r\ndark-coloured diamond, in which the crystalline cleavage, or tendency to\r\nsplit in certain directions (which belongs to the ordinary stones),\r\nappears to be almost absent; and the substance might be regarded as a\r\ntransition form between the diamond and graphite but for its hardness.\r\nThis substance was until lately used for the same purposes as _boort_,\r\nwhich is a nearer relative of the pure crystal, and like it, splits\r\nalong certain planes. It received from the miners the name of\r\n“_carbonado_,” and with regard to the application we are considering, it\r\nhas turned out to be a sort of Cinderella among diamonds; for its\r\nunostentatious appearance is more than compensated for by its surpassing\r\nall its more brilliant sisters in the useful property to which reference\r\nhas been made. This Brazilian term is doubtless the origin of the\r\nEnglish name by which the substance in question is known among the\r\nEnglish diamond merchants, who call it “carbonate”—an unfortunate word,\r\nfor it is used in chemistry with an entirely different signification.\r\n“Carbonate” it is, however, which supplies the requirements of the\r\nrock-drill, and the selected stones are set in a crown, or short tube,\r\nof steel, represented by _c_ in Fig. 183. In this they are secured as\r\nfollows: holes are drilled in the rim of the tube, and each hole is then\r\ncut so that a piece of the diamond exactly fits it, and when this piece\r\nhas been inserted, the metal is drawn round by punches, so as almost to\r\ncover the stone, leaving only a point projecting, _b b_. The portions of\r\nthe crown between the stones are somewhat hollowed out, as at _a_, for a\r\npurpose which will presently be mentioned. The crown thus set with the\r\nboring gems is attached to the end of a steel tube, by which it is made\r\nto rotate with a speed of about 250 revolutions per minute while pressed\r\nagainst the rock to be bored. Water is forced through the steel tube,\r\nand passing out between the rock and the crown, especially under the\r\nhollows, _c c_, makes its escape between the outside of the boring-tube\r\nand the rock, thus washing away all the _débris_ and keeping the drill\r\ncool. The pressure with which the crown is forced forward depends, of\r\ncourse, on the nature of the rock to be cut, and varies from 400 lbs. to\r\n800 lbs. In this way the hardest rocks are quickly penetrated—sometimes,\r\nfor example, at the rate of 4 in. per minute, compact limestone at 3\r\nin., emery at 2 in., and quartz at the rate of 1 in. per minute. It is\r\nfound that, even after boring through hundreds of feet of such\r\nmaterials, the diamonds are not in the least worn, but as fit for work\r\nas before: they are damaged only when by accident one of the stones gets\r\nknocked out of its setting; and this machine surpasses all in the\r\nrapidity with which it eats its way through the firmest rocks. This, it\r\nmust be observed, is the special privilege of the diamond drill—that,\r\nsince the begemmed steel crown and the boring-rods are alike tubular,\r\nthe rock is worn away in an annular space only, and a solid cylinder of\r\nstone is detached from the mass, which cylinder passes up with the\r\nhollow rods, where, by means of certain sliding wedges, it is held fast,\r\nand is drawn away with the rods.\r\n\r\nWhen the diamond drill is used merely for driving the holes for\r\nblasting, this cylinder of rock is not an important matter; but there is\r\nan application of the drill where this cylinder is of the greatest\r\nvalue, furnishing as it does a perfect, complete, and easily preserved\r\nsection of the whole series of strata through which the drill may pass\r\nwhen a bore-hole is sunk in the operation of searching for minerals\r\n(which is so significantly called in the United States “prospecting,” a\r\nphrase which seems to be making its way in England in mining\r\nconnections); for the core is uniformly cylindrical, the surface is\r\nquite smooth, and any fossils which may be present come up uninjured, so\r\nfar as they are contained in the solid core, and thus the strata are\r\nreadily recognized. Contrast this with the old method, where the\r\nbore-hole in prospecting is made by the reciprocating action imparted to\r\na steel tool, and merely the _pounded_ material is obtained, usually in\r\nvery small fragments, by augers or sludge-pumps: the fossils, which\r\nmight afford the most valuable indications, crushed and perhaps\r\nincapable of being recognized; and instead of the beautifully definite\r\nand continuous cylinder, a mere mass of _débris_ is brought up. In the\r\nprospecting-bores the diameter of the hole is from 2 in. to 7 in. The\r\nsize adopted depends on the nature of the strata to be penetrated, and\r\non the depth to which it is proposed to carry the boring. When the\r\nstrata are soft, the operation is commenced with a bore of 7 in., and\r\nwhen this has been carried to an expedient depth, the danger of the\r\nsides of the hole falling in is avoided by putting down tubes, and then\r\nthe diamond drill, fixed to tubes of a somewhat smaller diameter, will\r\nbe again inserted, and the boring recommenced; or the hole can be\r\nwidened, so as to receive the lining-tubes. Of course, in boring through\r\nhard rocks, such as compact limestones, sandstone, &c., no lining-tubes\r\nare necessary.\r\n\r\nIn a very interesting paper, read before the members of the Midland\r\nInstitute of Mining Engineers, by Mr. J. K. Gulland, the engineer of the\r\nDiamond Rock-Boring Company, who have the exclusive right of working the\r\npatents for this remarkable invention, that gentleman concludes by\r\nremarking that “the leading feature of the diamond drill is that it\r\nworks without percussion, thus enabling the holing of rocks to be\r\neffected by a far simpler class of machinery than any which has to\r\nstrike blows. Every mechanical engineer knows, often enough to his cost,\r\nthat he enters upon a new class of difficulties when he has to recognize\r\nit as a normal state of things with any machinery he is designing that\r\nportions of it are brought violently to rest. These difficulties\r\nincrease very much when the power, as in the case of deep bore-holes,\r\nhas to be conveyed for a considerable distance. Where steel is used a\r\npercussive action is necessitated, as, if a scraping action is used, the\r\ndrill wears quicker than the rock. The extraordinary hardness of the\r\ndiamond places a new tool in our hands, as its hardness, compared with\r\nordinary rock, say granite, is practically beyond comparison. Putting\r\nbreakages on one side, a piece of “carbonate” would wear away thousands\r\nof times its own bulk of granite. Irrespective of the private and\r\ncommercial success which this invention has attained, it is a boon to a\r\ncountry such as ours, where minerals constitute in a great measure our\r\nnational wealth and greatness.”\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the diamond drill may be illustrated by the case of\r\nwhat is termed the Sub-Wealden Exploration. From certain geological\r\nconsiderations, which need not be entered upon here, several eminent\r\nBritish and continental geologists have arrived at the conclusion that\r\nit is probable that coal underlies the Wealden strata of Kent and\r\nSussex, and that it may be perhaps met with at a workable depth. If such\r\nshould really prove to be the case, the industrial advantages to the\r\nsouth of England would be very great, for the existence of coal so\r\ncomparatively near to the metropolis would prove not only highly\r\nlucrative to the owners of the coal, but confer a direct benefit upon\r\nthousands by cheapening the cost of fuel. A number of property owners\r\nand scientific men, having resolved that the matter should be tested by\r\na bore, raised funds for the purpose, and a 9 in. bore had been carried\r\ndown to a depth of 313 ft. in the ordinary manner, when a contract was\r\nentered into with the Diamond Rock-Boring Company for a 3 in. bore\r\nextracting a cylinder of rock 2 in. in diameter. The company, as a\r\nprecautionary measure, lined the old hole with a 5 in. steel tube; and\r\nin spite of some delay caused by accidents, they increased the depth of\r\nthe hole to 1,000 ft. in the interval from 2nd February, 1874, to 18th\r\nJune, 1874–-the progress of the work being regarded with the greatest\r\ninterest by the scientific world. Unfortunately, the further progress of\r\nthe work has been prevented by an untoward event, namely, the breaking\r\nof the boring-rod, or rather tube; and, although the company is prepared\r\nwith suitable tackle for extracting the tubes in case of accidents of\r\nthis kind, and generally succeeds in lifting them by a taper tap, which,\r\nentering the hollow of the tube, lays hold of it by a few turns—yet, in\r\nthis instance, where there have been special difficulties, the\r\nextraction of so great a length of tubes is, as the reader may imagine,\r\nby no means an easy task. Six attempts have been made to remove the\r\nboring-rods which have dropped down; but so difficult has this operation\r\nproved, that, all these efforts having failed, it has been decided to\r\nabandon the old work and commence a new boring on an adjacent spot. A\r\ncontract has been entered into with the Diamond Boring Company, who have\r\nundertaken to complete the first 1,000 ft. for £600, which is only £200\r\nmore than it would have cost to completely line the old bore-holes with\r\niron tubes—an operation which was contemplated by the committee in\r\ncharge of the exploration. The terms agreed to by the company are very\r\nfavourable to the promoters of the Sub-Wealden Exploration, although the\r\ncost of the second 1,000 ft. will be £3,000 more; and the committee are\r\nrelying upon the public for contributions to enable them to carry on\r\ntheir enterprise. It is most probable that funds will be forthcoming,\r\nand should the boring result in the finding of coal measures beneath the\r\nWealden strata, all the nation will be the richer and participate in the\r\nadvantages resulting from an undertaking carried on by private persons.\r\nAlready a totally unexpected source of wealth has been met with by the\r\nold bore showing the existence of considerable beds of gypsum in these\r\nstrata, and the deposits of gypsum are about to be worked. Whether coal\r\nbe found or not found, there is no doubt that a bore-hole going down\r\n2,000 ft. will greatly increase our geological knowledge, and may reveal\r\nfacts of which we have at present no conception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 184.—_The Diamond Drill Machinery for deep Bores._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe boring-tubes, it maybe remarked, are made in 6 ft. lengths, and are\r\nso contrived that the joints are nearly flush—that is, there is no\r\nprojection at the junctions of the tubes. Fig. 184 is engraved from a\r\nphotograph of the machinery used for working the diamond drill when\r\nboring a hole for “prospecting.” This looks at first sight a very\r\ncomplicated machine, but in reality each part is quite simple in its\r\naction, and is easily understood when its special purpose has been\r\npointed out. We cannot, however, do more than indicate briefly the\r\ngeneral nature of the mechanism. The reader will on reflection perceive\r\nthat, although the idea of causing a rod to rotate in a vertical hole\r\nmay be simple, yet in practically carrying it out a number of different\r\nmovements and actions have to be provided for in the machinery. The\r\nweight of the rods cannot be thrown on the cutters, nor borne by the\r\nmoving parts of the machine—hence the movable disc-shaped weights\r\nattached to the chains are to balance the weight of the boring-rods as\r\nthe length of the latter is increased. There must also be a certain\r\namount of _feed_ given to the cutters, regulated and adjusting itself to\r\navoid injurious excess: hence a nut which feeds the drill is encircled\r\nby a friction-strap in which it merely slips round without advancing the\r\ncutter when the proper pressure is exceeded. There must be means of\r\nthrowing this into or out of gear, or advancing the tool in the work and\r\nof withdrawing it—hence the handles seen attached to the brake-straps.\r\nWater must be drawn from some convenient source, and caused to pass down\r\nthe drill-tube—hence the force-pump seen in the lowest part of the\r\nfigure. The rods must be raised by steam power and lowered by mechanism\r\nunder perfect control—hence suitable gearing is provided for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe reader may be interested in learning what is the cost of\r\n“prospecting” with this unique machinery. The company usually undertake\r\nto bore the first 100 ft. for £40, but the next 100 ft. cost £80–-that\r\nis, for 200 ft. £120 would be charged; the third 100 ft. would cost\r\n£120–-that is to say, the first 300 ft. would cost £240, and so on—each\r\nlower 100 ft. costing £40 more than the 100 ft. above it. Some of the\r\nholes bored have been of very great depth, and have been executed in a\r\nmarvellously short space of time. Thus, in 54 days, a depth of 902 ft.\r\nwas reached at Girrick in a boring for ironstone; another for coal at\r\nBeeston reached 1,008 ft.; and at Walluff in Sweden 304½ ft. were put\r\ndown in one week!\r\n\r\nThese machines are peculiarly suitable for submarine boring, for they\r\nwork as well under water as in the air; and they will no doubt be put\r\ninto requisition in the preliminary experiments about to be made for\r\nthat great project which bids fair to become a sober fact—the Channel\r\nTunnel between England and France; and as, by the time these pages will\r\nbe before the public, the work of the greatest and boldest rock-boring\r\nyet attempted will have commenced, and the scheme itself will be the\r\ntheme of every tongue, the Author feels that the present article would\r\nbe incomplete without some particulars of the great enterprise. [1875.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _THE CHANNEL TUNNEL._\r\n\r\nThe notion of connecting England and France by a submarine line of\r\nrailways is not of the latest novelty, but has been from time to time\r\nmooted by the engineers of both countries. The most carefully prepared\r\nscheme, however, is embodied in the joint propositions of Sir J.\r\nHawkshaw and Messrs. Brunlees and Low among English engineers; and those\r\nof M. Gamond on the French side, which these gentlemen have prepared at\r\nthe invitation of the promoters of the scheme, give the clearest and\r\nmost authentic account of the considerations on which this gigantic\r\nenterprise will be based, and from this document we draw the following\r\npassages:\r\n\r\n    The undersigned engineers, some of whom have been engaged for a\r\n    series of years in investigating the subject of a tunnel between\r\n    France and England, having attentively considered those\r\n    investigations and the facts which they have developed, beg to\r\n    report thereon jointly for the information of the committee.\r\n\r\n    These investigations supported the theory that the Straits of\r\n    Dover were not opened by a sudden disruption of the earth at that\r\n    point, but had been produced naturally and slowly by the gradual\r\n    washing away of the upper chalk; that the geological formations\r\n    beneath the Straits remained in the original order of their\r\n    deposit, and were identical with the formations of the two shores,\r\n    and were, in fact, the continuation of those formations.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Low proposed to dispense entirely with shafts in the sea, and\r\n    to commence the work by sinking pits on each shore, driving\r\n    thence, in the first place, two small parallel driftways or\r\n    galleries from each country, connected at intervals by transverse\r\n    driftways. By this means the air could be made to circulate as in\r\n    ordinary coal-mines, and the ventilation be kept perfect at the\r\n    face of the workings.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Low laid his plans before the Emperor of the French in April,\r\n    1867, and in accordance with the desire of his Majesty, a\r\n    committee of French and English gentlemen was formed in\r\n    furtherance of the project.\r\n\r\n    For some years past Mr. Hawkshaw’s attention has been directed to\r\n    this subject, and ultimately he was led to test the question, and\r\n    to ascertain by elaborate investigations whether a submarine\r\n    tunnel to unite the railways of Great Britain with those of France\r\n    and the Continent of Europe was practicable.\r\n\r\n    Accordingly, at the beginning of the year 1866, a boring was\r\n    commenced at St. Margaret’s Bay, near the South Foreland; and in\r\n    March, 1866, another boring was commenced on the French coast, at\r\n    a point about three miles westward of Calais; and simultaneously\r\n    with these borings an examination was carried on of that portion\r\n    of the bottom of the Channel lying between the chalk cliffs on\r\n    each shore.\r\n\r\n    The principal practical and useful results that the borings have\r\n    determined are that on the proposed line of the tunnel the depth\r\n    of the chalk on the English coast is 470 ft. below high water,\r\n    consisting of 175 ft. of upper or white chalk and 295 ft. of lower\r\n    or grey chalk; and that on the French coast the depth of the chalk\r\n    is 750 ft. below high water, consisting of 270 ft. of upper or\r\n    white chalk and 480 ft. of lower or grey chalk; and that the\r\n    position of the chalk on the bed of the Channel, ascertained from\r\n    the examination, nearly corresponds with that which the geological\r\n    inquiry elicited.\r\n\r\n    In respect to the execution of the work itself, we consider it\r\n    proper to drive preliminary driftways or headings under the\r\n    Channel, the ventilation of which would be accomplished by some of\r\n    the usual modes adopted in the best coal-mines.\r\n\r\n    As respects the work itself, the tunnel might be of the ordinary\r\n    form, and sufficiently large for two lines of railway, and to\r\n    admit of being worked by locomotive engines, and artificial\r\n    ventilation could be applied; or it might be deemed advisable, on\r\n    subsequent consideration, to adopt two single lines of tunnel. The\r\n    desirability of adopting other modes of traction may be left for\r\n    future consideration.\r\n\r\nSuch are the essential passages of the report which, in 1868, was\r\nsubmitted to the Government of the Emperor Louis Napoleon, and was made\r\nthe subject of a special commission appointed by the Emperor to inquire\r\ninto the subject in all its bearings. The commission presented its\r\nreport in 1869, and these are the chief conclusions contained in it:\r\n\r\n    I. The commission, after having considered the documents relative\r\n    to the geology of the Straits, which agree in establishing the\r\n    continuity, homogeneity, and regularity of level of the _grey\r\n    chalk_ between the two shores of the Channel,\r\n\r\n    Are of opinion that driving a submarine tunnel in the lower part\r\n    of this chalk is an undertaking which presents reasonable chances\r\n    of success.\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless they would not hide from themselves the fact that its\r\n    execution is subject to contingencies which may render success\r\n    impossible.\r\n\r\n    II. These contingencies maybe included under two heads: either in\r\n    meeting with ground particularly treacherous—a circumstance which\r\n    the known character of the grey chalk renders improbable; or in an\r\n    influx of water in a quantity too great to be mastered, and which\r\n    might find its way in either by infiltration along the plane of\r\n    the beds, or through cracks crossing the body of the chalk.\r\n\r\n    Apart from these contingencies, the work of excavation in a soft\r\n    rock like grey chalk appears to be relatively easy and rapid; and\r\n    the execution of a tunnel, under the conditions of the project, is\r\n    but a matter of time and money.\r\n\r\n    III. In the actual state of things, and the preparatory\r\n    investigations being too incomplete to serve as a basis of\r\n    calculation, the commission will not fix on any figure of expense\r\n    or the probable time which the execution of the permanent works\r\n    would require.\r\n\r\nThe chart, Fig. 185, and the section, Fig. 186, will give an idea of the\r\ncourse of the proposed tunnel, which will connect the two countries\r\nalmost at the nearest points. The depth of the water in the Channel\r\nalong the proposed line nowhere exceeds 180 ft.—little more than half\r\nthe height of St. Paul’s Cathedral, which building would, therefore, if\r\nsunk in the midst of the Channel, still form a conspicuous object rising\r\nfar above the waves. But the tunnel will pass through strata at least\r\n200 ft. below the bottom of the Channel, rising towards each end with a\r\nmoderate gradient; and from the lower points of these inclines the\r\ntunnel will rise slightly with a slope of 1 in 2,640 to the centre, or\r\njust sufficient for the purposes of drainage. On the completion of the\r\ntunnel a double line of rails will be laid down in it, and trains will\r\nrun direct from Dover to Calais. Companies have already been formed in\r\nEngland under the presidency of Lord Richard Grosvenor, and in France\r\nunder that of M. Michel Chevalier, and the legislation of each country\r\nhas sanctioned the enterprise. Verily the real magician of our times is\r\nthe engineer, who, by virtually abolishing space, time, and tide, is\r\nable to transport us hither and thither, not merely one or two—almost\r\nlike the magicians we read of in the “Arabian Nights,” with their\r\nenchanted horses or wonderful carpets—but by hundreds and by tens of\r\nhundreds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 185.—_Chart of the Channel Tunnel._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe “Daily News” of January 22nd, 1875, in presenting its readers with a\r\nchart of the proposed tunnel, offered also the following sensible and\r\ninteresting comment on the subject:\r\n\r\n“This long-debated project has at length emerged from the region of\r\nspeculation, and is entering the stage of practical experiment. On this\r\nside the Channel a company has been formed to carry out the work, and on\r\nthe other side the French Minister of Public Works has presented to the\r\nAssembly a Bill authorizing a French company to co-operate with the\r\nEnglish engineers. The enterprise is one worthy of the nations which\r\nhave in the present generation joined the two shores of the Atlantic by\r\nan electric cable, and cut a ship canal through the Isthmus of Suez, and\r\nof the age which has obliterated the old barrier of the Alps. All these\r\ngigantic undertakings seemed almost as bold in conception and as\r\ndifficult of execution as the great work now about to commence. Those\r\ntwenty miles of sea have long been crossed by telegraph lines; they will\r\nsoon be bridged, as it were, by splendid steamers; but even our own\r\ngeneration, accustomed as it is to gigantic engineering works, has\r\nscarcely regarded the construction of a railway underneath the waves as\r\nwithin the reach of possibility. M. Thomé de Gamond, who first made the\r\nsuggestion five and thirty years ago, was long regarded as an\r\nover-sanguine person, who did not recognize the inevitable limits of\r\nhuman skill and power. A tunnel under twenty miles of stormy sea seemed\r\nvery much like an engineer’s dream, and it is only within the last few\r\nyears that it has been regarded as a feasible project. Of its\r\npossibility, however, there seems now to be no manner of doubt. It is\r\nmerely a stream of sea-water, and not a fissure in the earth, which\r\ndivides us from the Continent. Prince Metternich was right in speaking\r\nof it as a ditch. The depth is nowhere greater than one hundred and\r\neighty feet; and so far as careful soundings can ascertain the condition\r\nof the soil underneath the water, it consists of a smooth unbroken bed\r\nof chalk. The success of the experiment depends on this bed of chalk\r\nbeing continuous and whole. Should any very deep fissure exist, which is\r\nextremely improbable, the tunnel may probably not be driven through it.\r\nBut given, what every indication shows to exist, a homogeneous chalk bed\r\nsome hundreds of feet in thickness, the driving of a huge bore for\r\ntwenty miles through it is a mere question of time, money, and\r\norganization, and as the engineers have these resources at their\r\ncommand, they are sanguine, and we may even say confident, of success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 186.—_Section of the Channel Tunnel._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 187.—_View of Dover._\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The method by which it is proposed that the excavation shall be made is\r\nin some respects similar to that which was successfully employed in\r\ntunnelling the Alps. Mont Cenis was pierced by machinery adapted to the\r\ncutting of hard rock; the chalk strata under the Channel are to be bored\r\nby an engine, invented by Mr. Dickenson Brunton, which works in the\r\ncomparatively soft strata like a carpenter’s auger. A beginning will be\r\nmade simultaneously on both sides of the Channel, and the effort will at\r\nfirst be limited to what we may describe as making a clear hole through\r\nfrom end to end. This small bore, or driftway as it is called, will be\r\nsome seven or nine feet in diameter. If such a communication can be\r\nsuccessfully made, the enlargement will be comparatively easy. Mr.\r\nBrunton’s machine is said to cut through the chalk at the rate of a yard\r\nan hour. We believe that those which were used in the Mont Cenis Tunnel\r\ncut less than a yard a day of the hard rock of the mountain. Two years,\r\ntherefore, ought to be sufficient to allow the workers from one end to\r\nshake hands with those from the other side. The enlargement of the\r\ndriftway into the completed tunnel would take four years’ more labour\r\nand as many millions of money. The millions, however, will easily be\r\nraised if the driftway is made, since the victory will be won as soon as\r\nthe two headways meet under the sea. One of the great difficulties of\r\nthe work is shared with the Mont Cenis Tunnel, the other is peculiar to\r\nthe present undertaking. The Alps above the one, and the sea above the\r\nother, necessarily prevent the use of shafts. The work must be carried\r\non from each end; and all the _débris_ excavated must be brought back\r\nthe whole length of the boring, and all the air to be breathed by the\r\nworkmen must be forced in. The provision of a fit atmosphere is a mere\r\nmatter of detail. In the great Italian tunnel the machines were moved by\r\ncompressed air, which, being liberated when it had done its work,\r\nsupplied the lungs of the workers with fresh oxygen. The Alpine\r\nengineers, however, started from the level of the earth: the main\r\ndifficulty of the Submarine Tunnel seems to be that it must have as its\r\nstarting-point at each end the bottom of a huge well more than a hundred\r\nyards in depth. The Thames Tunnel, it will be remembered, was\r\napproached, in the days when it was a show place, by a similar shaft,\r\nthough of comparatively insignificant depth. This enterprise may indeed\r\nbe said to bear something like the relation to the engineering and\r\nmechanical skill of the present day which Brunel’s great undertaking\r\nbore to the powers of an age which looked on the Thames Tunnel as the\r\neighth wonder of the world. Probably the danger which will be incurred\r\nin realizing the larger scheme is less than that which Brunel’s workmen\r\nfaced.\r\n\r\n“It is, of course, impossible for any estimate to be formed of the risks\r\nof this enormous work. They have been reduced to a minimum by the\r\nmechanical appliances now at our disposal, but they are necessarily\r\nconsiderable. The tunnel is to run, as we understand, in the lower\r\nchalk, and there will be, as M. de Lesseps told the French Academy, some\r\nfifty yards of soil—a solid bed of chalk, it is hoped—between the\r\nsea-water and the crown of the arch. Moreover, an experimental half-mile\r\nis to be undertaken on each side before the work is finally begun; the\r\nengineers, in fact, will not start on the journey till they have made a\r\nfair trial of the way. Altogether the beginning seems to us to be about\r\nto be made with a combination of caution and boldness which deserves\r\nsuccess, even though it should be unable to command it. Unforeseen\r\ndifficulties may arise to thwart the plans, but the enterprise, so far,\r\nis full of promise. The opening of such a communication between this\r\ncountry and the Continent will be a pure gain to the commercial and\r\nsocial interests on both sides. It obliterates the Channel so far as it\r\nhinders direct communication, yet keeps it intact for all those\r\nadvantages of severance from the political complications of the\r\nContinent, which no generation has more thoroughly appreciated than our\r\nown. The commercial advantages of the communication must necessarily be\r\nbeyond all calculation. A link between the two chief capitals of Western\r\nEurope, which should annex our railway system to the whole of the\r\nrailways of the Continent, would practically widen the world to pleasure\r\nand travel and every kind of enterprise. The 300,000 travellers who\r\ncross the Channel every year would probably become three millions if the\r\nsea were practically taken out of the way by a safe and quick\r\ncommunication under it. The journey to Paris would be very little more\r\nthan that from London to Liverpool. It is, however, quite needless to\r\nenlarge on these advantages. The Channel Tunnel is the crowning\r\nenterprise of an age of vast engineering works. Its accomplishment is to\r\nbe desired from every point of view, and, should it be successful, it\r\nwill be as beneficent in its results as the other great triumphs of the\r\nscience of our time.”\r\n\r\nThe Channel Tunnel is not yet a _fait accompli_, although the\r\npreliminary trial works have been made at both ends. Drift-ways of some\r\nten feet diameter have been cut beneath the waters of the strait, and\r\ninstead of the experimental half mile mentioned in the foregoing\r\nparagraph, the works have been pushed forward on the English side for\r\nabout a mile and a quarter with complete success. As was anticipated, no\r\nphysical difficulties were met with, for the machines did their work\r\nwith the greatest ease, and the drift has now remained for some years\r\npractically free from any infiltration of water. These results indicate\r\nthat the scheme might be completed with speed and safety. Parliament,\r\nhowever, has refused to allow the undertaking to proceed, being moved to\r\nthis course by the opinions of military authorities, who see dangers to\r\nEngland in the completion of this enterprise, or at least such a\r\ndisturbance of the British complacency at the notion that our island\r\nmight be reached otherwise than “by the inviolate sea,” that the whole\r\nland would be liable to terrors and alarms from invasion by stratagem.\r\nIt is represented that huge fortresses and a special army for that\r\npurpose would become necessary to guard the mouth of the tunnel were it\r\nmade. This is, perhaps, the kind of objection which such an enterprise\r\ncould not fail to raise. But it can hardly be expected that all the\r\ncommercial and international advantages which the realization of the\r\nscheme would undoubtedly secure are for ever to stand in abeyance for\r\nsuch opinions as have, for the present, caused the operations to be\r\nsuspended. It has been pointed out that there are many ways of instantly\r\nrendering such a tunnel impracticable in case of a sudden alarm. But the\r\nnecessity could only arise after a supposed paralysis or destruction of\r\nsuch army and navy as Britain could bring together to defend her land.\r\nPerhaps military skill will presently devise less costly methods of\r\ndefence than those authorities now suppose the tunnel would require; or,\r\neven if such armaments were really necessary for our sense of insular\r\nsecurity, the expense might be no unprofitable outlay for the advantages\r\nto be gained. It is satisfactory to know that the promoters of the\r\nscheme are sanguine of the subsidence of the military and political\r\nprejudices, which are now the only obstacles to its accomplishment. A\r\nsomewhat unexpected result from the operations in connection with the\r\nexperimental driftways has been the discovery, on the Kentish coast, of\r\nseams of coal underlying the chalk at a workable depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _THE ST. GOTHARD RAILWAY._\r\n\r\nSince the completion of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, a still greater piece of\r\nrock boring has been begun and finished in the great tunnel of the St.\r\nGothard Railway. The construction of a railway to connect Italy with\r\nSwitzerland, was a project conceived as far back as 1838, when the first\r\nrailway company in the latter country was constructed. The route of the\r\nproposed line was a matter of much debate, not alone on account of\r\ndifference of engineering opinions, but also by reason of the various\r\ncompeting interests that would have to be reconciled and induced to\r\nco-operate in the work. The St. Gothard route was only one of the\r\nseveral schemes that were advocated, and the first decisive step appears\r\nto have been taken at Lucerne, where, in 1853, a meeting was called by\r\nthe authorities of the canton to consider the merits of the project; the\r\nresult being that the Lucerne Government addressed to the Federal\r\nCouncil a representation of the advantages this route would afford. More\r\ndiscussion ensued, and it was only when Switzerland appeared likely to\r\nhave no share in the traffic between the Milan district and the more\r\nnorthern parts of Europe that, in 1861, the partizans of the St. Gothard\r\nroute appointed a provisional committee to take action in the matter.\r\nThis committee had plans prepared, and sent a deputation to obtain the\r\nassent of the Italian Government. The canton of Tessin, through which\r\nthe projected line, or its then surviving rival, was designed to pass,\r\nbecame a lively scene in the game of speculation, for promoters rushed\r\nin to secure, if possible, concessions which they might sell at a very\r\nadvanced price to the winning party. For this purpose came to that poor\r\nSwiss canton Jews and Christians from every land. The St. Gothard route\r\ngained the day, and a Union was, in 1863, formed by the concurrence of\r\nthe two principal Swiss railways and fifteen of the cantons most\r\ninterested in the scheme. Difficulties and delays were, however,\r\nencountered before the necessary compacts could be concluded with the\r\nneighbouring states—and then there came the war of 1867. So that it was\r\nnot until the latter part of 1872 that the construction of the line was\r\nactually entered upon. Before the great work of piercing the St. Gothard\r\nhad been completed, the undertaking was embarrassed by financial\r\ndifficulties arising from the fact of the lines on the Italian side\r\ncosting more than double the estimated amount. The Swiss Government,\r\nhowever, voted a special subsidy, and the work, which had been suspended\r\nfor a while, was proceeded with; much attention being paid to its\r\neconomical prosecution. In 1881, when the line was opened, the mails\r\nwere carried between Zurich and Bellinzona in seven hours, instead of in\r\nthirty hours as previously required for transit by the excellently\r\nappointed mail carriages under the Federal Administration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 187_a_.—_Map of the St. Gothard Railway._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBesides the great tunnel, the St. Gothard line has some unique devices\r\nin railway construction which cannot fail to interest the reader.\r\nSeveral of the passes over the Alps have been made use of from time\r\nimmemorial. We know that Hannibal led his Carthaginian hosts over one of\r\nthem, and that they have been traversed by Roman legions, as well as by\r\nGermanic hordes. But, although the St. Gothard is the most direct of all\r\nthe routes, it never afforded a passage to armies or migratory tribes.\r\nThe road through this pass was not formed by the use of any elaborate\r\nappliances for overcoming the natural obstacles: it was rather the work\r\nof simple peasants and mountain shepherds, with such rough constructions\r\nin wood as might give a sufficiently secure passage across the torrents\r\nand gorges. The old road keeps beside the Reuss from the head of the\r\nlake of Lucerne until it reaches the highest level of the pass, where\r\nthe water-shed occurs. It then descends steeply, with many twists and\r\nwindings, to the banks of the Ticino, and it follows the course of this\r\nriver to its embouchure at Tresa, on Lago Maggiore. The railway follows\r\nthe same course, except that it cuts off the higher part of the pass by\r\nthe great tunnel piercing the mountain. The scenery throughout could,\r\nperhaps, be nowhere equalled for the variety of its wild grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe great tunnel of the St. Gothard passes from Gœschenen, on the Reuss,\r\nbeneath the col of the pass, and emerges close to the village of Airolo,\r\non the banks of the Ticino. The length of this tunnel is rather more\r\nthan nine and a quarter miles, so that it is about one and a half miles\r\nlonger than the Mont Cenis Tunnel. Its northern end is 3,638 feet above\r\nthe sea level; its southern end is higher, namely, 3,756 feet; but there\r\nis an intermediate point in the tunnel higher than either-–3,786\r\nfeet—and from this there is a uniform incline in each direction. The\r\ntunnel is 300 yards beneath the lowest part of the valley of Andermatt,\r\nand the summits of the mountains it traverses are at least a mile above\r\nit. The motive power by which the rock-drilling machines used in driving\r\nthe tunnel were actuated was, as in the case of the Mont Cenis Tunnel,\r\ncompressed air; and the power used for compressing the air was, in this\r\ncase also, a head of water,—but this was not applied in the same way.\r\nThe waters of the Reuss at the northern side, and those of the Tremola\r\nand of the Ticino at the southern side, were taken at a considerable\r\nheight in very large cast-iron pipes, and were made to act upon powerful\r\nturbines that gave motion to the compressing machines. These were\r\ncapable of compressing the air so that its volume was reduced to\r\none-twentieth, and the pressure it then exercised would, of course, be\r\nequal to that of twenty atmospheres, or about 300 lbs. on the square\r\ninch,—or more than three times as much as was made use of in the Mont\r\nCenis Tunnel. The compressed air, carried through pipes to the head of\r\nthe workings in the rock, was there allowed to exert its force on the\r\npistons of the perforators in the manner already described. There was,\r\nin fact, a continual repetition of exactly the same cycle of operations\r\nof boring, charging, firing, etc., that are mentioned on page 355. A\r\nlarge quantity of the compressed air was always allowed to rush into the\r\nwork immediately after each blasting, in order that the smoke and other\r\nproducts might be driven out and the atmosphere rendered fit for\r\nrespiration. In attacking the mountain simultaneously from each side it\r\nwas, of course, essential that the tunnels should be driven in precisely\r\nthe same direction, and therefore the positions of the points of\r\ndeparture had to be determined by very careful surveys. At Gœschenen,\r\nthe gorge of the Reuss did not naturally admit of a sufficient distance\r\nof vision to fix the direction with the required accuracy, and it became\r\nnecessary to pierce a thick mass of rock with a special tunnel for the\r\npurpose of taking a sight sufficiently far back. At Airolo, again, the\r\ntunnel had to enter the valley by curving towards the village; and here\r\na provisional gallery had to be driven in the straight line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\n  THE NORTH MOUTH OF THE GREAT TUNNEL, ST. GOTHARD RAILWAY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSeveral contractors competed for the work of constructing this great\r\ntunnel, and it was at first supposed that an Italian company, which was\r\nmanaged by some of the principal engineers engaged on the Mont Cenis,\r\nwould be almost certain to obtain the contract. The promoters, however,\r\nintrusted the work to a private individual, M. Louis Favre, of Geneva.\r\nThis gentleman undertook to complete the tunnel in eight years, at the\r\nprice of 2,800 francs per mètre for the work of excavation merely,\r\nexclusive of masonry, etc. This cost would be not far from £101 per\r\nEnglish yard. The contract was signed on August 7th, 1872, and on\r\nSeptember 12th of the same year M. Favre commenced operations at the\r\nsouthern end, and the work at the northern end was begun on October 9th\r\nfollowing. The operations were carried on with great energy, and even\r\nduring the period of the Company’s financial difficulties there was no\r\nstoppage of the works between Gœschenen and Airolo. It has been\r\nsuggested that it was largely due to the regular and successful progress\r\nof this great piece of rock boring that the Company were enabled to\r\nre-establish themselves on a basis that ensured the completion of the\r\nwhole undertaking. The contractor, on his part, did not fail to\r\nencounter many physical difficulties. At the southern end much trouble\r\nwas caused by torrents of water gushing from the soil, many of these\r\nbeing of great volume and force; in fact, the work was here carried on\r\nfor nearly a whole year in the midst of water—for the ground for the\r\nfirst mile consisted of glacial and other deposits, which were\r\nintersected by subterranean water-courses. Reaching the solid rock was\r\nhere a relief. But at Gœschenen little of loose formation was met with;\r\nbut the rock encountered was of extreme hardness—consisting, indeed, of\r\nalmost pure quartz, which had the effect of quickly blunting the points\r\nof even the best tempered tools. But another kind of difficulty had to\r\nbe overcome when the workings got beneath the vale of Urseren. Here, at\r\nseveral places, layers of argillaceous matter were found between the\r\nmasses of hard rock. These layers were easy enough to pierce through,\r\nbut on account of the pressure of the rocks in which they were\r\ninterspersed, they were squeezed out and gradually protruded within the\r\ntunnel, which would soon have become entirely obstructed. At first a\r\nvery massive lining of timber was tried, but it was soon found that this\r\nmust be replaced by a solid vaulting of stone. The first vault failed to\r\nsustain the pressure, and so did the second, although the thickness of\r\nthe material was more than a yard. In some places these operations had\r\nto be several times repeated, and from this cause the cost of parts of\r\nthe tunnel has been nearly £1,000 per yard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 187_b._—_The Uppermost Bridge over the Maïenreuss._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe instances above mentioned may be taken as mere specimens of the\r\nphysical difficulties attending a work of this kind. There are often\r\nothers arising from the unusual circumstances under which the workmen\r\nare placed, and others again from accidental causes alone. M. Favre\r\nexperienced some of these, as, for example, when one year a fire\r\ndestroyed the greater part of the village of Airolo; another year there\r\nwas a strike on the part of the workmen. The high temperature in the\r\nworkings was, especially towards the end, a source of great trouble. The\r\ncause of the heat is no doubt the same as that which is held to support\r\nthe theory of the earth’s central heat. Numberless observations have\r\nestablished the fact that the temperature of the earth’s crust increases\r\nas we go deeper. The increase appears not to be uniform in different\r\nplaces—at least there is much discrepancy in the estimates that have\r\nbeen made. But as a sufficient approximation to a general statement, it\r\nmay be taken as proved that for every seventy feet or so that you go\r\nbelow the surface of the ground, there is an increase of the temperature\r\nof the strata equal to 1° Fahrenheit. Now, the workmen in the two\r\nsections of the tunnel had, at last, to carry on their labour in a\r\ntemperature of more than 100° Fahrenheit. This, perhaps, might have been\r\none cause of some unprecedented kinds of malady that appeared amongst\r\nthe tunnel labourers. M. Favre himself was not destined to witness the\r\ncompletion of his great undertaking, for, on July 19th, 1879, as he was\r\nreturning from an inspection of the tunnel, he fell into the arms of his\r\ncompanions, struck down by a fatal attack of apoplexy. On February 29th,\r\n1880, the last fuse required to blast down the rock separating the two\r\ntunnels was fired by one of the few workmen who had been engaged in the\r\noperations during the whole period from their commencement. It was found\r\nthat the two tunnels met exactly and coincided in direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 187_c_.—_The Bridges over the Maïenreuss near Wasen._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe construction of such a line of railway as the St. Gothard tries the\r\nskill of the engineer, and taxes all the resources of his art. The\r\nproblems presented by the nature of the route, and the requirements of\r\nthe iron road, have in this case been successfully solved by bold\r\nexpedients—by new and ingenious devices. The reader will readily\r\nunderstand that the ordinary cart road may wander about, so to speak, of\r\nits own will; it is not confined to the limited gradient of the line; or\r\nobliged to make its turns and curves of at least a certain radius. Now,\r\nthere are portions of the valley where the general slope is too steep\r\nfor the railway to follow, and where it was necessary to form it in\r\nzig-zags, so that certain sections of the gorge or valley may be several\r\ntimes traversed by the line returning upon itself. Fig. 187_d_ is a view\r\nshowing an incident of this kind, and one of the most interesting spots\r\non the route. The dark line on the spectator’s right is the track of the\r\nrailway; the white trace, which in the lower part of the view is seen on\r\nthe other side of the Reuss, is the ordinary road. If this last be\r\nfollowed up the valley, it will be seen to cross first the Reuss, and\r\nthen a tributary stream (the _Maïenreuss_) descending through a gorge on\r\nthe right, after which it zig-zags up a hill to the village of _Wasen_\r\n(the church of which village is seen crowning the eminence in the centre\r\nof our view), and then it continues its course up the valley, passing\r\nthrough a small village, and disappearing over the shoulder of a hill on\r\nthe right bank of the river. Let us now carefully follow the railway\r\nfrom where the train at the bottom of the picture is seen ascending the\r\ngradient. The line presently passes under a bridge, and then enters the\r\ntunnel, near to the entrance of which a small building will be noticed.\r\nThe course of the tunnel is shown by the _curve_ marked in dots, for\r\nthis tunnel makes a round within the rock, and the railway emerges to\r\nday again at a point lower down in the course of the valley than at the\r\nentrance to the tunnel, but at a higher level. It is seen in the figure\r\nappearing from behind the rocks in the right-hand lower corner, passing\r\nunder a short tunnel and continuing along the mountain side. The curved\r\ntunnel resembles in direction part of the turn of a corkscrew; it is one\r\nof a series of _helicoidal_ tunnels of which there are several examples\r\non the line. The entrance to this tunnel is 2,539 feet, the exit 2,654\r\nfeet, above the sea level. It is known as _Pfaffensprung_ (Monk’s Leap)\r\nTunnel. The line again enters a short tunnel, and immediately crosses\r\nthe deep gorge of the Maïenreuss, to plunge again into another tunnel at\r\nthe base of this hill on which Wasen stands. Higher up it crosses the\r\nReuss and enters the helicoidal tunnel of _Wattingen_ (dotted line). On\r\nemerging from this, the line re-crosses the Reuss, and may now be traced\r\n_down_ the valley, but higher up on the mountain side, coming in the\r\nreverse direction, and after passing _Wasen_ on the other side,\r\nre-crossing the Maïenreuss gorge by a second bridge. Then turning back\r\nagain through another helicoidal tunnel (_Leggistein_) the line crosses\r\nthe Maïenreuss for the third time, and continues its course up the\r\nvalley. Fig. 187_c_ gives us a near view of _Wasen_, and a glimpse up\r\nthe gorge of the Maïenreuss from its junction with the Reuss. The bridge\r\nwith the large single arch is that which carries the ordinary road, and\r\nhigher up we see the three iron bridges that carry the railway backwards\r\nand forwards in its doublings. We can well imagine the perplexity of\r\nanyone ascending the valley in the train for the first time, and\r\nignorant of the peculiarities of this extraordinary railway. In crossing\r\nthe first, or lowest bridge, over the Maïenreuss, he would catch a\r\nglimpse of the church of Wasen, perched on its hill, high above him, and\r\non his right. After being carried through more tunnels, and over more\r\nbridges, he would some minutes afterwards be disposed to think that his\r\neyes were deceiving him, for there, still on his right, he would see the\r\nsame church, but now on about the same level as the train. Again, after\r\nmore tunnels and bridges, the church would once more appear, transferred\r\nto the left of the line, and sunk very far down. These several\r\napparitions of the same building in different positions, after the train\r\nhas seemed to have been pursuing its onward course the while,—which\r\ncourse would not be judged by any impressions the traveller would\r\nusually receive to be other than rectilinear,—are indeed a regular\r\nbewilderment to the inexperienced traveller. He is then obliged finally\r\nto resign himself passively to be carried he knows not whither or how,\r\nfor his sense of direction is completely at fault;—the train comes out\r\nof tunnels which seem turned the wrong way; the river, which he expected\r\nto find on the left hand, he sees on the right; and the Reuss appears to\r\nhave reversed the direction of its flow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 187_d_.—_Windings of the Line near Wasen._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the St. Gothard line has been a great commercial\r\nsuccess, for the number of passengers entering and leaving Italy by that\r\nroute has been enormous, and still shows a large annual increase.\r\nIndeed, the prosperity of the line has been so great that the project\r\nhas been revived of carrying another railway over the Alps to connect\r\nItaly and Switzerland by way of the Simplon. If this scheme should be\r\ncarried out, the mountains will be pierced by a tunnel of a length\r\ndouble that of the St. Gothard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 188.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing pages have been devoted to the description of inventions\r\nor operations in which mechanical actions are the most obvious features.\r\nSome of the contrivances described have for their end and object the\r\ncommunication of motion to certain bodies, others the arrangement of\r\nmaterials in some definite form, and all are essentially associated with\r\nthe idea of what is called _matter_. But we are now about to enter on\r\nanother region—a region of marvels where all is enchanted ground—a\r\nregion in which we seem to leave far behind us our grosser conceptions\r\nof matter, and to attain to a sphere of more refined and subtile\r\nexistence. For we are about to show some results of those beautiful\r\ninvestigations in which modern science has penetrated the secrets of\r\nNature by unfolding the laws of light—\r\n\r\n                                                   “Light\r\n             Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure.”\r\n\r\nThe diversity and magnificence of the spectacles which, by day as well\r\nas by night, are revealed to us by the agency of light, have been the\r\ntheme of the poet in every age and in every country. It cannot fail to\r\narrest the attention to find Science declaring that all the loveliness\r\nof the landscape, the fresh green tints of early summer and the golden\r\nglow of autumn, the brilliant dyes of flowers, of insects, of birds, the\r\nsoft blue of the cloudless sky, the rosy hues of sunset and of dawn, the\r\nchromatic splendour of rubies, emeralds, and other gems, the beauties of\r\nthe million-coloured rainbow,—are all due to light—to light alone, and\r\nare not qualities of the bodies themselves, which merely _seem_ to\r\npossess the colours. The following quaint stanzas, in which a poet of\r\nthe seventeenth century addresses “Light” have a literal correspondence\r\nwith scientific truth:\r\n\r\n         “All the world’s bravery, that delights our eyes,\r\n         Is but thy several liveries;\r\n         Thou the rich dye on them bestowest,\r\n         Thy nimble pencil paints this landscape as thou goest.\r\n\r\n         “A crimson garment in the rose thou wearest:;\r\n         A crown of studded gold thou bearest;\r\n         The virgin lilies, in their white,\r\n         Are clad but with the lawn of almost naked light.\r\n\r\n         “The violet, Spring’s little infant, stands\r\n         Girt in thy purple swaddling-bands;\r\n         On the fair tulip thou dost dote;\r\n         Thou clothest it in a gay and parti-coloured coat.”\r\n\r\nAll these beauties are indeed derived from the imponderable and\r\n_invisible_ agent, light; and the variety and changefulness of the\r\neffects we may constantly observe show that light possesses the power of\r\nimpressing our visual organs in a thousand different ways, modified by\r\nthe surrounding circumstances, as witness that ever-shifting\r\ntransformation scene—the sky. In the skies of such a climate as that of\r\nEngland there are ceaseless changes and ever-beautiful effects,\r\nproducing everywhere more perfect and diversified pictures than the\r\nrichest galleries can show. In the night how changed is the spectacle,\r\nwhen the sun’s more powerful rays are succeeded by the soft light of the\r\nmoon, sailing through the azure star-bestudded vault! What limitless\r\nscope for the artist is afforded by these innumerable modifications of a\r\nsingle subtile agent, in light and shade, brightness and obscurity, in\r\nthe contrasts and harmonies of colours, and in the countless hues\r\nresulting from their mixtures and blendings!\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary, before attempting to explain the discoveries and\r\ninventions which prove how successfully science, aided by the powerful\r\nmathematical analysis of modern times, has acquired a knowledge of the\r\nways of light, to discuss such of the ordinary phenomena as have a\r\ndirect bearing upon the subjects to be considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 189.—_Rays._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _SOME PHENOMENA OF LIGHT._\r\n\r\nIt may be considered as a matter of common experience that light is able\r\nto pass through certain bodies, such as air and gases, pure water,\r\nglass, and a number of other liquids and solids, which, by virtue of\r\nthis passage of light, we term _transparent_, in opposition to another\r\nclass of bodies, called _opaque_, through which light does not pass.\r\nThat light traverses a vacuum may be held as proved by the light of the\r\nsun and stars reaching us across the interplanetary spaces; but it may\r\nalso be made the subject of direct experiment by an apparatus described\r\nbelow, Fig. 190. Another fact, very obvious from common observation, is\r\nthat light usually travels in straight lines. Some familiar experiences\r\nmay be appealed to for establishing this fact. For example, every one\r\nhas observed that the beams of sunlight which penetrate an apartment\r\nthrough any small opening pursue their course in perfectly straight\r\nlines across the atmosphere, in which their path is rendered visible by\r\nthe floating particles of dust. It is by reason of the straightness with\r\nwhich rays of light pursue their course that the joiner, by looking\r\nalong the edge of a plank, can judge of its truth, and that the engineer\r\nor surveyor is able by his theodolite and staff to set out the work for\r\nrectilinear roads or railways. On a grander scale than in the sunbeam\r\ntraversing a room, we witness the same fact in the effect represented in\r\nFig. 189, where the sun, concealed from direct observation, is seen to\r\nsend through openings in the clouds, beams that reveal their paths by\r\nlighting up the particles of haze or mist contained in the atmosphere.\r\nIt is not the air itself which is rendered visible; but whenever a beam\r\nof sunlight, or of any other brilliant light, is allowed to pass through\r\nan apartment which is otherwise kept dark, the track of the beam is\r\nalways distinctly visible, and, especially if the light be concentrated\r\nby a lens or concave mirror, the fact is revealed that the air, which\r\nunder ordinary circumstances appears so pure and transparent, is in\r\nreality loaded with floating particles, requiring only to be properly\r\nlighted up to show themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 190.\r\n]\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall, in the course of some remarkable researches on the\r\ndecomposition of vapours by light, wished to have such a glass tube as\r\nthat represented in Fig. 190, filled with air perfectly free from these\r\nfloating particles. When the beam of the electric lamp passed through\r\nthe exhausted tube, no trace of the existence of anything within the\r\ntube was revealed, for it appeared merely like a black gap cut out of\r\nthe visible rays that traversed the air; thus proving that light,\r\nalthough the agent which makes all things become visible, _is itself\r\ninvisible_—that, in fact, we see not light, but only illuminated\r\nsubstances. When, however, air was admitted to the tube, even after\r\npassing through sulphuric acid, the beam of the light became clearly\r\nrevealed within the tube, and it was only by allowing the air to stream\r\nvery slowly into the exhausted glass tube through platinum pipes, packed\r\nwith platinum gauze and intensely heated, that Professor Tyndall\r\nsucceeded in obtaining air “optically empty,” that is, air in which no\r\nfloating particles revealed the track of the beams. The destruction of\r\nthe floating matter by the incandescent metal proves the particles to be\r\norganic; but a more convenient method of obtaining air free from all\r\nsuspended matter was found by Professor Tyndall to be the passing of the\r\nair through a _filter of cotton wool_. It must not be supposed that it\r\nis only occasionally, or in dusty rooms, laboratories, or lecture-halls,\r\nthat the air is charged with organic and other particles—\r\n\r\n                  “As thick as motes in the sunbeams.”\r\n\r\n“The air of our London rooms,” says Tyndall, “is loaded with this\r\norganic dust, nor is the country air free from its pollution. However\r\nordinary daylight may permit it to disguise itself, a sufficiently\r\npowerful beam causes the air in which the dust is suspended to appear as\r\na semi-solid, rather than as a gas. Nobody could, in the first instance,\r\nwithout repugnance, place the mouth at the illuminated focus of the\r\nelectric beam and inhale the dust revealed there. Nor is this disgust\r\nabolished by the reflection that, although we do not see the nastiness,\r\nwe are drawing it in our lungs every hour and minute of our lives. There\r\nis no respite to this contact with dirt; and the wonder is, not that we\r\nshould from time to time suffer from its presence, but that so small a\r\nportion of it would appear to be deadly to man.” The Professor then goes\r\non to develop a very remarkable theory, which attributes such diseases\r\nas cholera, scarlet fever, small pox, and the like, to the inhalation of\r\norganic _germs_ which may form part of the floating particles. But we\r\nmust return to our immediate subject by a few words on the\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _VELOCITY OF LIGHT._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 191.—_Telescopic appearance of Jupiter and Satellites._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt may be stated at once, that this velocity has the amazing magnitude\r\nof 185,000 miles in one second of time, and that the fact of light\r\nrequiring time to travel was first discovered, and the speed with which\r\nit does travel was first estimated, about 200 years ago, by a Danish\r\nastronomer, named Roemer, by observations on the eclipses of the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter. The satellites of Jupiter are four in number, and\r\nas they revolve nearly in plane of the planet’s orbit, they are subject\r\nto frequent eclipses by entering the shadow cast by the planet; in fact,\r\nthe three inner satellites at every revolution. Fig. 191 represents the\r\ntelescopic appearance of the planet, from a drawing by Mr. De La Rue,\r\nand in this we see the well-known “belts,” and two of the satellites,\r\none of which is passing across the face of the planet, on which its\r\nshadow falls, and is distinctly seen as a round black spot, while the\r\nother may be noticed at the lower right-hand corner of the cut. The\r\nsatellite next the planet (Io) revolves round its primary in about 42½\r\nhours, and consequently it is eclipsed by plunging into the shadow of\r\nJupiter at intervals of 42½ hours, an occurrence which must take place\r\nwith the greatest regularity as regards the duration of the intervals,\r\nand which can be calculated by known laws when the distance of the\r\nsatellite from the planet has been determined. Nevertheless, Roemer\r\nobserved that the actual intervals between the successive immersions of\r\nIo in the shadow of Jupiter did not agree with the calculated period of\r\nrotation when the distance between Jupiter and the earth was changing,\r\nin consequence chiefly of the movement of the latter (for Jupiter\r\nrequires nearly twelve years to complete his revolution, and may,\r\ntherefore, be regarded as stationary as compared for a short time with\r\nthe earth). Roemer saw also, that when this distance _was increasing_,\r\nthe observed intervals between the successive eclipses were a little\r\ngreater, and that when the distance _was decreasing_ they were a little\r\nless, than the calculated period. And he found that, supposing the\r\nearth, being at the point of its orbit nearest to Jupiter, to recede\r\nfrom that planet, the _sum of all the retardations_ of the eclipses\r\nwhich occur while the earth is travelling to the farthest point of its\r\norbit, amounts to 16½ minutes, as does also the _sum of the\r\ndeficiencies_ in the period when the earth, approaching Jupiter, is\r\npassing from the farthest to the nearest point of her orbit. While,\r\nhowever, the earth is near the points in her orbit farthest from, or\r\nnearest to Jupiter, the distance between the two planets is not\r\nmaterially _changing_ between successive eclipses, and _then_ the\r\nobserved intervals of the eclipses coincide, with the period of the\r\nsatellite’s rotation. The reader will, after a little reflection, have\r\nno difficulty in perceiving that the 16½ minutes represent the time\r\nwhich is required by the light to traverse the diameter of the earth’s\r\norbit; or, if he should have any difficulty, it may be removed by\r\ncomparing the case with the following.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that from a railway terminus trains are dispatched every\r\nquarter of an hour, and that the trains proceed with a common and\r\nuniform velocity of, say, one mile per minute. Now, a person who remains\r\nstationary, at any point on the railway, observes the trains passing at\r\nregular intervals of fifteen minutes, no matter at what part of the line\r\nhe may be placed. But now, let us imagine that a train having that very\r\ninstant passed him, he begins to walk along the line towards the place\r\nfrom which the trains are dispatched: it is plain that he will meet the\r\nnext train before fifteen minutes—he would, in fact, meet it a mile\r\nhigher up the line than the point from which he began his walk fourteen\r\nminutes before; but the train, taking a minute to pass over this mile,\r\nwould pass his point of departure just fifteen minutes after its\r\npredecessor. And our imaginary pedestrian, supposing him to continue his\r\njourney at the same rate, would meet train after train at intervals of\r\nfourteen minutes. Similarly, if he walked away from the approaching\r\ntrains, they would overtake him at intervals of sixteen minutes. And\r\nagain, it would be easy for him to calculate the speed of the trains,\r\nknowing that they passed over each point of the line every fifteen\r\nminutes. Thus, suppose him to pass _down_ the line a distance known to\r\nbe, say, a quarter of a mile; suppose he leaves his station at noon, the\r\nmoment a train has passed, and that he takes, say an hour, to arrive at\r\nhis new station a quarter of a mile lower; here, observing a train to\r\npass at fifteen seconds after one o’clock, and knowing that it passed\r\nhis original station at one, he has a direct measure of the speed of the\r\ntrains. Here we have been explaining a discovery two centuries old; but\r\nour purpose is to prepare the reader for an account of how the velocity\r\nof light has been recently measured in a direct manner, and it certainly\r\nappears a marvellous achievement that means have been found to measure a\r\nvelocity so astounding, not in the spaces of the solar system, or along\r\nthe diameter of the earth’s orbit, but within the narrow limits of an\r\nordinary room! The reliance with which the results of these direct\r\nmeasures will be received, will be greatly increased by the knowledge of\r\nthe astronomical facts with which they show an entire concordance. In\r\ntaking leave of Roemer, we may mention that his discovery, like many\r\nothers, and like some inventions which have been described in this book,\r\ndid not for some time find favour with even the scientific world, nor\r\nwas the truth generally accepted, until Bradley’s discovery of the\r\naberration of light completely confirmed it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 192.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo two gifted and ingenious Frenchmen we are indebted for independent\r\nmeasurements of the velocity of light by two different methods. The\r\ngeneral arrangement of M. Fizeau’s method is represented in Fig. 192, in\r\nwhich the rays from a lamp, L, after passing through a system of lenses,\r\nfall upon a small mirror, M N, formed of unsilvered plate-glass inclined\r\nat an angle of 45° to the direction of the rays; from this they are\r\nreflected along the axis of a telescope, T, by the lens of which being\r\nrendered parallel, they become a cylindrical beam, B, which passes in a\r\nstraight line to a station, D, at a distance of some miles (in the\r\nactual experiment the lamp was at Suresnes and the other station at\r\nMontmartre, 5½ miles distant) whence the beam is reflected along the\r\nsame path, and returns to the little plate of glass at M N, passing\r\nthrough which it reaches the eye of the observer at E. At W is a toothed\r\nwheel, the teeth of which pass through the point F, where the rays from\r\nthe lamp come to a focus; and as each tooth passes, the light is stopped\r\nfrom issuing to the distant station. This wheel is capable of receiving\r\na regular and very rapid rotation from clockwork in the case, C,\r\nprovided with a register for recording the number of its revolutions. If\r\nthe wheel turns with such a speed that the light permitted to pass\r\nthrough one of the spaces travels to the mirror and back in exactly the\r\nsame time that the wheel moves and brings the next space into the tube,\r\nor the second space, or the third, or any _space_, the reflected light\r\nwill reach the spectator’s eye just as if the wheel were stationary; but\r\nif the speed be such that a _tooth_ is in the centre of the tube when\r\nthe light returns from the mirror, then it will be prevented from\r\nreaching the spectator’s eye at all, so long as this particular speed is\r\nmaintained, but either a decrease or an increase of velocity would cause\r\nthe luminous image to reappear. Speeds between those by which the light\r\nis seen, and those by which it entirely disappears, cause it to appear\r\nwith merely diminished brilliancy. It is only necessary to observe the\r\nspeed of the wheel when the light is at its brightest, and when it\r\nsuffers complete eclipse, for then the time is known which is required\r\nfor space and tooth respectively to take the place of another space—and\r\nhence the time required for the light to pass to the mirror and back is\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nM. Foucault’s method is similar in principle to that used by Wheatstone\r\nin the measurement of the velocity of electricity. He used a mirror\r\nwhich was made to revolve at the rate of 700 or 800 turns _per second_,\r\nand the arrangement of the apparatus was such as to admit of the\r\nmeasurement of the time taken by light to pass over the short space of\r\nabout four yards! More recently, however, he has modified and improved\r\nhis apparatus by adopting a most ingenious plan of maintaining the speed\r\nof the mirror at a determined rate, which he now prefers should be 400\r\nturns per second, while the light is reflected backwards and forwards\r\nseveral times, so that it traverses a path of above 20 yards in length.\r\nThe time taken by the light to travel this short distance is, of course,\r\nextremely small, but it is accurately measured by the clockwork\r\nmechanism, and found to be about the 1/150000000th of a second! The\r\nresults of these experiments of Foucault’s make the velocity of light\r\nseveral thousand miles per second less than that deduced from the\r\nastronomical observation of Roemer and Bradley, in which the distance of\r\nthe earth from the sun formed the basis of the calculations; and hence\r\narose a surmise that this distance had been over-estimated. That such\r\nhad, indeed, been the case was confirmed almost immediately afterwards\r\nby a discussion among the astronomers as to the correctness of the\r\naccepted distance, the result of which has been that the mean distance,\r\nwhich was formerly estimated at 95 millions of miles, has, by careful\r\nastronomical observations and strict deductions, been now estimated at\r\nbetween 91 and 92 millions of miles. The famous transit of Venus\r\nDecember 9th, 1873–-to observe which the Governments of all the chief\r\nnations of the world sent out expeditions—derived its astronomical and\r\nscientific importance from its furnishing the means of calculating, with\r\ngreater correctness than had yet been attained, the distance of the\r\nearth from the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 193.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 194.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 195.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _REFLECTION OF LIGHT._\r\n\r\nLong before plate glass backed by brilliant quicksilver ever reflected\r\nthe luxurious appointments of a drawing-room; long before looking-glass\r\never formed the mediæval image of “ladye fair”; long before the haughty\r\ndames of imperial Rome were aided in their toilettes by _specula_; long\r\nbefore the dark-browed beauties of Egypt peered into their brazen\r\nmirrors; long, in fact, before men knew how to make glass or to polish\r\nmetals, their attention and admiration must have often been riveted by\r\nthose perfect and inverted pictures of the landscape, with its rocks,\r\ntrees, and skies, which every quiet lake and every silent pool presents.\r\nEnjoyment of the spectacle probably prompted its imitation by the\r\nformation artificially of smooth flat reflecting surfaces; and no doubt\r\ngreat skill in the production of these, and their application to\r\npurposes of utility, coquetry, and luxury, preceded by many ages any\r\nattempt to discover the laws by which light is reflected. The most\r\nfundamental of these laws are very simple, and for the purpose we have\r\nin view, it is necessary that they should be borne in mind. Let A B,\r\nFig. 193, be a _plane reflecting surface_, such as the surface of pure\r\nquicksilver or still water, or a polished surface of glass or metal, and\r\nlet a ray of light fall upon it in the direction, I O, meeting the\r\nsurface at O, it will be reflected along a line, O R,—such that if at\r\nthe point O we draw a line, O P, perpendicular to the surface, the\r\nincident ray, I O, and the reflected ray, O R, will form equal angles\r\nwith the perpendicular—in other words, the angle of incidence will be\r\nequal to the angle of reflection, and the perpendicular, the incident\r\nray, and the reflected ray, will all be in one plane perpendicular to\r\nthe reflecting plane. It would be quite easy to prove from this law that\r\nthe luminous rays from any object falling on a plane reflecting surface\r\nare thrown back just _as if_ they came from an object placed behind the\r\nreflecting surface symmetrically to the real object. The diagrams in\r\nFigs. 194 and 195 will render this clear. In the second diagram, Fig.\r\n195, it will be noticed that only the portion of the mirror between Q\r\nand P takes any part in the action, and therefore it is not necessary,\r\nin order to see objects in a plane mirror, that the mirror should be\r\nexactly opposite to them; thus the portion O Q might be removed without\r\nthe eye losing any part of the image of the object A B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 196.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are many very interesting and important scientific instruments in\r\nwhich the laws of reflection from plane surfaces are made use of—such,\r\nfor example, as the _sextant_ and the _goniometer_; but passing over all\r\nthese, we may say a word about the formation of several images from one\r\nobject by using two mirrors. It has already been explained that the\r\naction of a plane mirror is equivalent to the placing of objects behind\r\nit symmetrically disposed to the real object. The reflections, or\r\n_virtual images_ in the mirror, behave optically exactly _as if_ they\r\nwere themselves real objects, and are reflected by other mirrors in\r\nprecisely the same manner. From this it follows that two planes inclined\r\nto each other at an angle of 90° give three images of an object placed\r\nbetween them, the images and the object apparently placed at the four\r\nangles of a rectangle. When the mirrors are inclined to each other at an\r\nangle of 60°, five images are produced, which, with the original object,\r\nshow an hexagonal arrangement. The formation of these by the principle\r\nof symmetry is indicated in Fig. 196. It was these symmetrically\r\ndisposed images which suggested to Sir David Brewster the construction\r\nof the instrument so well known as the _kaleidoscope_, in which two—or,\r\nstill better, three—mirrors of black glass, or of glass blackened on one\r\nside, are placed in a pasteboard tube inclined to each other at 60°: one\r\nend of the tube is closed by two parallel plates of glass; the outer one\r\nground, but the inner transparent, leaving between them an interval, in\r\nwhich are placed fragments of variously-coloured glass, which every\r\nmovement of the instrument arranges in new combinations. At the other\r\nend of the tube is a small opening—on applying the eye to which one sees\r\ndirectly the fragments of glass, with their images so reflected that\r\nbeautifully symmetrical patterns are produced; and this with endless\r\nvariety. When this instrument was first made in the cheap form in which\r\nit is now so familiarly known, it obtained a popularity which has\r\nperhaps never been equalled by any scientific toy, for it is said that\r\nno fewer than 200,000 kaleidoscopes were sold in London and Paris in one\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 197.—_Polemoscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy way of contrast to the mirrors of the kaleidoscope harmlessly\r\nproducing beautiful designs, by symmetrical images of fragments of\r\ncoloured glass, we show the reader, in Fig. 197, mirrors which are\r\nreflecting quite other scenes, for here is seen the manner in which even\r\nthe plane mirror has been pressed into the service of the stern art of\r\nwar. The mirrors are employed, not like those of Archimedes, to send\r\nback the sunbeams from every side, and by their concentration at one\r\nspot to set on fire the enemy’s works, but to enable the artillerymen in\r\na battery to observe the effect of their shot, and the movement of their\r\nadversaries, without exposing themselves to fire by looking over the\r\nparapet of their works. The contrivance has received the appropriate\r\nname of _Polemoscope_ (πολεμος, _war_, and σκοπεω, _to view_), and it\r\nconsists simply, as shown in the figure, of two plane mirrors so\r\ninclined and directed, that in the lower one is seen by reflection the\r\nlocalities which it is desired to observe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 198.—_Apparatus for Ghost Illusion._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe return once more to the arts of peace, in noticing the advantage\r\nwhich has been lately taken of plane mirrors for the production of\r\nspectral and other illusions, in exhibitions and theatrical\r\nentertainments, the improvement in the manufacture of plate-glass having\r\npermitted the production of enormous sheets of that substance. Among the\r\nmost popular exhibitions of this class was that known as “Pepper’s\r\nGhost,” the arrangement of the mirrors having been the subject of a\r\npatent taken out by Mr. Pepper and Mr. Dircks jointly. The principle on\r\nwhich the production of the illusion depends, may be explained by the\r\nfamiliar experience of everybody who has noticed that, in the twilight,\r\nthe glass of a window presents to a person inside of a room the images\r\nof the light or bright objects in the apartment, while the objects\r\noutside are also visible through the glass. As, by night coming on, the\r\nreflections increase in brilliancy, the darkness outside is almost\r\nequivalent to a coat of black paint on the exterior surface of the\r\nglass; but, on the contrary, in the daylight no reflection of the\r\ninterior of the room is visible to the spectator inside, on looking\r\ntowards the window. The reflections are present, nevertheless, in the\r\nday-time as well as at night, only they are overpowered and lost when\r\nthe rays which reach the eye _through_ the glass are relatively much\r\nmore powerful. Even in the day-time the image of a lighted candle is\r\nusually visible, in the absence of direct sunshine, against a dark\r\nportion of the exterior objects as a back-ground. The visibility, or\r\notherwise, of the internal objects by reflection, and of the external\r\nobjects seen through the glass, depends entirely on the relative\r\nintensities of the illumination, for the more illuminated side\r\noverpowers and conceals the other, just as the rising sun causes the\r\nstars “to pale their ineffectual fires.” Hence, on looking through the\r\nwindow on a dark night, we cannot see objects out of doors unless we\r\nscreen off the reflection of the illuminated objects in the room. If the\r\nrays transmitted through the glass, and those which are reflected, have\r\nintensities not very different, we see then the reflected images mixed\r\nup in the most curious manner with the real objects. It is exactly in\r\nthis way that the ghosts are made to appear in the illusion of which we\r\nare speaking. The real actors are seen through a large plate of\r\ncolourless and transparent glass, and from the front surface of this\r\nglass rays are reflected which apparently proceed from a phantom taking\r\na part in the scene among the real actors. The arrangement is shown in\r\nFig. 198, where E G is the stage, separated from the auditorium, h, by a\r\nlarge plate of transparent glass, E F, placed in an inclined position,\r\nand not visible to the spectators, for the lights in front are turned\r\ndown, and the stage is also kept comparatively dark. Parallel to the\r\nlarge plate of glass is a silvered mirror, C D, placed out of the\r\nspectators’ sight, and receiving the rays from a person at A, also out\r\nof sight of the spectators, and strongly illuminated by an oxy-hydrogen\r\nlime-light at B. The manner in which the rays are reflected from the\r\nsilvered mirror to the plate-glass, and hence reflected so as to reach\r\nthe spectators and give them the impression of a figure standing on the\r\nstage at G, is sufficiently indicated by the lines drawn in the diagram.\r\nThe apparitional and unsubstantial character of the image is derived\r\nfrom its seeming transparency, and from the manner in which it may be\r\nmade to melt away, by diminishing the brightness of the light which\r\nfalls on the real person. The introduction of the second mirror was a\r\ngreat improvement, for by this the phantom is made to appear erect,\r\nwhile its original stands in a natural attitude. Whereas, with only the\r\nplate-glass, E F, the _ghost_ could not be made to appear upright,\r\nunless, indeed, as was sometimes done, the plate was inclined at an\r\nangle of 45°, and the actor of the ghost lay horizontally beneath it. A\r\nscene of the kind produced by the improved apparatus, is represented in\r\nFig. 198_a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 198_a_.—_The Ghost Illusion._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother illusion is produced by the help of a large silvered mirror,\r\nplaced at an inclination of 45°, sloping backwards from the floor, and,\r\nin consequence, presenting to the spectators the image of the ceiling,\r\nwhich appears to them the back of the scene. The mirror is perforated\r\nnear the centre by an opening, through which a person passes his head,\r\nand, all his body being concealed by the mirror, the effect produced is\r\nthat of a head floating in the air. Means are provided of withdrawing\r\nthe mirror, when necessary, while the curtain is down, and then the real\r\nback of the scene appears, which, of course, is exactly similar to the\r\nfalse one painted on the ceiling. Fig. 199 represents a scene produced\r\nat the Polytechnic by a somewhat similar arrangement of mirrors, under\r\nthe management of Mr. Pepper. Plane mirrors were employed in another\r\npiece of natural magic which this gentleman exhibited to the public, who\r\nwere shown a kind of large box, or cabinet, raised from the floor, and\r\nplaced in the middle of the stage, so that the spectators might see\r\nunder it and all round it. Inside of the box were two silvered mirrors\r\nthe full height of it, and these were hinged to the farther angles, so\r\nthat each one being folded with its face against a side of the box,\r\ntheir backs formed the apparent sides, and were painted exactly the same\r\nas the real interior of the box. When the performer enters the box, the\r\ndoor is closed for an instant, while he, stepping to the back, turns the\r\nmirrors on their hinges until their front edges meet, where an upright\r\npost in the middle of the box conceals their line of junction. The\r\nperformer thus places himself behind the mirrors in the triangular space\r\nbetween them and the back of the box, while the mirrors, now inclined at\r\nangles of 45° to the sides, reflect images of these to the spectators\r\nwhen the door is opened, and the spectators see then the box apparently\r\nempty, for the reflection of the sides appears to them as the back of\r\nthe cabinet. The entertainment was sometimes varied by a skeleton\r\nappearing, on the door being opened, in the place of the person who\r\nentered the cabinet. It is hardly necessary to say that the skeleton was\r\npreviously placed in the angle between the mirrors where the performer\r\nconceals himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 199.—_Illusion produced by Mirrors._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 200.—_A Stage Illusion._\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo the same inventive gentleman, whose ingenious use of plane mirrors\r\nhas thus largely increased the resources of the public entertainer, is\r\ndue another stage illusion, the effect of which is represented in Fig.\r\n200; and, although it does not depend on reflection, it may be\r\nintroduced here as showing how the perfection of the manufacture of\r\nplate-glass, which makes it available for the ghost exhibition, can be\r\napplied in another way in dramatic spectacles. The female form, here\r\nsupposed to be seen in a dream by the sleeper, is not a reflection,\r\nalthough she appears floating in mid-air, strangely detached from all\r\nsupports, but the real actress. This is accomplished by making use of\r\nthe transparency of plate-glass, a material strong enough to afford the\r\nnecessary support, and yet invisible under the circumstances of the\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nBut it is not behind the turned-down footlights, or in the exhibitions\r\nof the showman, that we find the most beautiful illustrations of the\r\nlaws of reflection. In the quiet mountain mere, amid the sweet freshness\r\nof nature, we may often see tree, and crag, and cliff, so faithfully\r\nreproduced, that it needs an effort of the understanding to determine\r\nwhere substance leaves off and shadow begins, a condition of the liquid\r\nsurface indicated in two lines by Wordsworth:\r\n\r\n                  “The swan, on still St. Mary’s Lake,\r\n                  Floats double, swan and shadow.”\r\n\r\nThe landscape painter is always gratified if he can introduce into his\r\npicture some piece of water, and it can hardly be doubted that much of\r\nthe charm of lakes and rivers is due to their power of reflecting. Look\r\non Fig. 201, a view of some buildings at Venice; and, in order to see\r\nhow much of its beauty is owing to the quivering reflections, imagine\r\nthe impression it would produce were the place of the water occupied by\r\nasphalte pavement, or a grass lawn. The condition of the reflections\r\nhere represented is perhaps even more pleasing than that produced by\r\nperfect repose: they are in movement, and yet not broken and confused:\r\n\r\n                   “In bright uncertainty they lie,\r\n                   Like future joys to Fancy’s eye.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 201.—_View of Venice—Reflections._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _REFRACTION._\r\n\r\nThat light moves in straight lines is a statement which is true only\r\nwhen the media through which it passes are uniform; for it is easily\r\nproved that when light passes from one medium to another, a change of\r\ndirection takes place at the common surface of the media in all rays\r\nthat meet this surface otherwise than perpendicularly. As a consequence\r\nof this, it really is possible to see round a corner, as the reader may\r\nconvince himself by performing the following easy experiment. Having\r\nprocured a cup or basin, Fig. 202, let him, by means of a little\r\nbees’-wax or tallow, attach to the bottom of the vessel, at R, a small\r\ncoin. If he now places the cup so that its edge just conceals the coin\r\nfrom view, and maintains his eye steadily in the same position as at I,\r\nhe will, when water is poured into the cup, perceive the coin apparently\r\nabove the edge of the vessel in the direction I R´, that is, the bottom\r\nof the cup will appear to have risen higher. Since it is known that in\r\neach medium the rays pass in straight lines, the bending which renders\r\nthe coin visible can therefore only take place at the common junction of\r\nthe media, or, in other words, the ray, R O, passing from the object in\r\na straight line through the water, is bent abruptly aside as it passes\r\nout at the surface of the water, A B, and enters the air, in which it\r\nagain pursues a straight course, reaching the eye at I, where it gives\r\nthe spectator an impression of an object at R´. This experiment is also\r\nan illustration of the cause of the well-known tendency we have to\r\nunder-estimate the depth of water when we can see the bottom. The broken\r\nappearance presented by an oar plunged into clear water is due to\r\nprecisely the same cause. The curious exaggerated sizes and distorted\r\nshapes of the gold-fish seen in a transparent globe have their origin in\r\nthe same bending aside of the rays. This deviation which light undergoes\r\nin passing obliquely from one medium into another is known by the name\r\nof _refraction_, and it is essential for the understanding of the sequel\r\nthat the reader should be acquainted with some of the laws of this\r\nphenomenon, although their discovery by Snell dates two centuries and a\r\nhalf anterior to the present time. Let T O, Fig. 203, be a ray of light\r\nwhich falls obliquely upon a plane surface, A B, common to two different\r\nmedia, one of which is represented by the shaded portion of the figure,\r\nA B C D, of which C D represents another plane surface, parallel to the\r\nformer. If the ray, T O, suffered no refraction, it would pursue its\r\ncourse in a straight line to _R´_; but as a matter of fact it is found\r\nthat such a ray is always bent aside at O, if the medium A B C D is more\r\nor less dense than the other. If, for example, A B C D is water, and the\r\nmedium above it glass, then the ray entering at O will take the course O\r\n_R_; but if A B C D is a plate of glass with water above and below it,\r\nthe ray will take the course T O, O R, R B, suffering refraction on\r\nentering the glass, and again on leaving it, so that R B will emerge\r\nfrom the glass parallel to its original direction at T O. If through the\r\npoint of incidence, O, we suppose a line, O P, to be drawn perpendicular\r\nto the surface, A B, then we may say that the ray in passing from the\r\nrarer medium (water, air, &c.) into the denser medium (glass, &c.) is\r\nbent towards the perpendicular, or normal, as at O; but that on leaving\r\nthe denser to enter the rarer medium, as at R, it is bent away from the\r\nperpendicular. In other words, the angle _b_ O _a_ is less than the\r\nangle _m_ O T, and O R forms a less angle with R P´ than R B´ does. It\r\nis also a law of _ordinary_ refraction that the normal, O P, at the\r\npoint of incidence, the incident ray, T O, and the refracted ray, O R,\r\nare all in the same plane. Besides, there is the important and\r\ninteresting law discovered by Snell and by Descartes, which may thus be\r\nexplained with reference to Fig. 203. On the incident and refracted\r\nrays, T O and O R, let us suppose that any equal distances, O _d_ and O\r\n_b_, are measured off from O, and that from each of the points _a_ and\r\n_b_, perpendiculars, _a m_ and _b n_, are drawn to the normal, P P,\r\nwhich passes through O; then it is found that, whatever may be the angle\r\nof incidence, T O P, or however it is made to vary, the length of the\r\nline _a m_ bears always the same proportion to the line _b n_ for the\r\nsame two media. Thus, if A B C D be water, and T O enters it out of the\r\nair, the length of the line _a m_ divided by the length of the line _a\r\nb_ will always (whatever slope T O may have) give the quotient 1·33.\r\nThis number is, therefore, a constant quantity for air and water, and is\r\ncalled the index of refraction for air into water. The law just\r\nexplained is expressed by the language of mathematics thus: For two\r\ngiven media the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and of\r\nrefraction is constant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 202.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 203.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is an axiom in optical science that a ray of light when sent in the\r\nopposite direction will pursue the same path. Thus in Fig. 203 the\r\ndirection of the light is represented as from T towards B´; but if we\r\nsuppose B´ R to be an incident ray, it would pursue the path B´ R, R O,\r\nO T, and in passing out of the denser medium, A B C D at O, its\r\ndirection is farther from the normal, P P, or O T, as the law of sines,\r\n_a m_ will be always longer than _n b_, and will bear a constant ratio\r\nto it. Suppose the angle R O P to increase, then P O B will become a\r\nright angle; that is, the emergent ray, O T, will just graze the\r\nsurface, A B, when the angle R O P has some definite value. If this last\r\nangle be further increased, _no light at all will pass out of the\r\nmedium_ A B C D, but the ray R O will be totally reflected at O back\r\ninto the medium, A B C D, according to the laws of reflection. The angle\r\nwhich R O forms with O P when O T just skims the surface, A B, is termed\r\nthe _limiting angle_, or the _critical angle_, and its value varies with\r\nthe media. The reader may easily see the total reflection in an\r\naquarium, or even in a tumbler of water, when he looks up through the\r\nglass at the surface of the water, which has then all the properties of\r\na perfect mirror.\r\n\r\nThe power of lenses to form images of objects is entirely due to these\r\nlaws of refraction. The ordinary double-convex lens, for example, having\r\nits surfaces formed of portions of spheres, refracts the rays so that\r\n_all_ the rays which from _one luminous point_ fall upon the lens, meet\r\ntogether again at a point on the other side, the said point being termed\r\ntheir _focus_. It is thus that _images_ of luminous bodies are formed by\r\nlenses. An explanation of the construction and theory of lenses cannot,\r\nhowever, be entered into in this place.\r\n\r\nOne important remark remains to be made—namely, that in the above\r\nstatement of the laws of reflection and refraction, certain limitations\r\nand conditions under which they are true and perfectly general have not\r\nbeen expressed; for the mention of a number of particulars, which the\r\nreader would probably not be in a condition to understand, would only\r\ntend to confuse, and the explanation of them would lead us beyond our\r\nlimits. Some of these conditions belong to the phenomena we have to\r\ndescribe, and are named in connection with them, and others, which are\r\nnot in immediate relation to our subject, we leave the reader to find\r\nfor himself in any good treatise on optics.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _DOUBLE REFRACTION AND POLARIZATION._\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred years ago, a traveller, returning from Iceland,\r\nbrought to Copenhagen some crystals, which he had obtained from the Bay\r\nof Roërford, in that island. These crystals, which are remarkable for\r\ntheir size and transparency, were sent by the traveller to his friend,\r\nErasmus Bartholinus, a medical man of great learning, who examined them\r\nwith great interest, and was much surprised by finding that all objects\r\nviewed through them appeared double. He published an account of this\r\nsingular circumstance in 1669, and by the discovery of this property of\r\nIceland spar, it became evident that the theory of refraction, the laws\r\nof which had been studied by Snell and by Huyghens a few years before,\r\nrequired some modification, for these laws required only one refracted\r\nray, and Iceland spar gave two. Huyghens studied the subject afresh, and\r\nwas able, by a geometrical conception, to bring the new phenomena within\r\nthe general theory of light. Iceland spar is chemically carbonate of\r\nlime (calcium carbonate), and hence is also called calc spar, and, from\r\nthe shape of the crystals, it has also been termed rhombohedral spar.\r\nThe form in which the crystals actually present themselves is seen in\r\nFig. 204, which also represents the phenomenon of double refraction.\r\nIceland spar splits up very readily, but only along certain definite\r\ndirections, and from such a piece as that represented in Fig. 204 a\r\nperfect rhombohedron, such as that shown in Fig. 206, is readily\r\nobtained by cleavage; and then we have a solid having six lozenge-shaped\r\nsides, each lozenge or side having two obtuse angles of 101° 55´, and\r\ntwo acute angles of 78° 5´. Of the eight solid corners, such as A B C,\r\n&c., six are produced by the meeting of one obtuse and two acute angles,\r\nand _the remaining two solid corners are formed by the meeting of three\r\nobtuse angles_. Let us imagine that a line is drawn from one of these\r\nangles to the other: the diagonal so drawn forms the _optic axis_ of the\r\ncrystal, and a plane passing through the optic axis, A B, Fig. 205, and\r\nthrough the bisectors of the angles, E A D and F B G, marks a certain\r\ndefinite direction in the crystal, to which also belong all planes\r\nparallel to that just indicated. Any one of such planes forms what is\r\ntermed a “principal section,” to which we shall presently refer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 204.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 205.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 206.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in Fig. 204 the white circle on a black ground\r\nseen through the crystal is doubled; but that, instead of being white as\r\nthe circle really is, the images appear grey, except where they overlap,\r\nand there the full whiteness is seen. If we place the crystal upon a dot\r\nmade on a sheet of paper, or having made a small hole with a pin in a\r\npiece of cardboard, hold this up to the light, and place the crystal\r\nagainst it, we see apparently two dots or two holes. The two images\r\nwill, if the dot or hole be sufficiently small, appear entirely detached\r\nfrom each other. Now, if, keeping the face of the crystal against the\r\ncardboard or paper, the observer turn the crystal round, he will see one\r\nof the images revolve in a circle round the other, which remains\r\nstationary. The latter is called the _ordinary_ image, and the former\r\nthe _extraordinary_ image. Let us place the crystal upon a straight\r\nblack line ruled on a horizontal sheet of paper, Fig. 205, and let us\r\nsuppose, in order to better define the appearance, that we place it so\r\nthat the _optic axis_, A B, is in a plane perpendicular to the paper, A\r\nbeing one of the two corners where the three obtuse angles meet, and B\r\nthe other, and the face, A B C D, parallel to E G H B, which touches the\r\npaper. Then, according to the laws of ordinary refraction, if we look\r\n_straight_ down upon the crystal, we should see through it the line I K,\r\nunchanged in position—that is, the ray would pass perpendicularly\r\nthrough the crystal as shown by L M—and, in fact, a part of the ray does\r\nthis, and gives us the _ordinary_ image, O O´; but another part of the\r\nray departs from the laws of Snell and Descartes, and, following the\r\ncourse L N Y´, enters the eye in the direction N Y´, producing the\r\nimpression of another line at L´, which is the _extraordinary_ ray, E\r\nE´. If the crystal be turned round on the paper, E E´ will gradually\r\napproach O O´, and the two images will coincide when the _principal\r\nsection_ is parallel to the line I K; but the coincidence is only\r\napparent, and results from the superposition of the two images—for a\r\nmark placed on the line drawn on the paper will show two images, one of\r\nwhich will follow the rotation of the crystal, and show itself to the\r\nright or left of the _ordinary_ image, according as C is to the right or\r\nleft of A. So that there are really in every portion of the crystal two\r\nimages on the line, one of which turns round the other, and the\r\ncoalescence of the two images twice in each revolution is only apparent,\r\nfor the different parts of the lengths of the images do not coincide. On\r\ncontinuing the revolution of the crystal after they apparently coincide,\r\nthe images are again seen to separate, the _extraordinary_ one being now\r\ndisplaced on the other side, or always towards the point, C. Thus, then,\r\nthe ray, on entering the crystal, bifurcates, one branch passing through\r\nthe crystal and out of it in the same straight line, just as it would in\r\npassing through a piece of glass, while the other is refracted at its\r\nentrance into the crystal, although falling perpendicularly upon its\r\nface, and again at its exit. And again, when a beam of light, R _r_,\r\nFig. 206, falls obliquely on a crystal of Iceland spar, it divides at\r\nthe face of the crystal into two rays, _R_ O, and _r_ E; the former,\r\nwhich is the ordinary ray, follows the laws of ordinary refraction—it\r\nlies in the plane of incidence, and obeys the law of sines, just as if\r\nit passed through a piece of plate-glass. The _extraordinary_ ray, on\r\nthe other hand, departs from the plane of incidence, except when the\r\nlatter is parallel to the _principal section_, and the ratio of the\r\nsines of the angles of incidence and refraction varies with the\r\nincidence. The reader who is desirous of studying these curious\r\nphenomena of _double_ refraction, and those of polarization, is strongly\r\nrecommended to procure some fragments of Iceland spar, which he can very\r\neasily cleave into rhombohedra, and with these, which need not exceed\r\nhalf an inch square, or cost more than a few pence, he can demonstrate\r\nfor himself the phenomena, and become familiar with their laws. He will\r\nfind very convenient the simple plan recommended by the Rev. Baden\r\nPowell, of fixing one of the crystals to the inside of the lid of a\r\npill-box, through which a small hole has been made, and through the hole\r\nand the crystal view a pin-hole in the bottom of the box, turning the\r\nlid, and the crystal with it, to observe the rotation of the image. The\r\nsame arrangement will serve, by merely attaching another rhomb of spar\r\nwithin the box, to study the very interesting facts of the polarization\r\nto which we are about to claim the reader’s attention.\r\n\r\nThe curious phenomena which have just been described, although in\r\nthemselves by no means recent discoveries, have led to some of the most\r\ninteresting and beautiful results in the whole range of physical\r\nscience. The examination and discussion of them by such able\r\ninvestigators as Huyghens, Descartes, Newton, Fresnel, Malus, and\r\nHamilton, have largely conduced to the establishment of the undulatory\r\nhypothesis—that comprehensive theory of light, which brings the whole\r\nsubject within the reach of a few simple mechanical conceptions.\r\n\r\nIt was at first supposed that it was only one of the rays which are\r\nproduced in double refraction that departed from the ordinary laws, and\r\nIceland spar was almost the only crystal known to have the property in\r\nquestion. At the present day, however, the substances which are known to\r\nproduce double refraction are far more numerous than those which do not\r\npossess this property, for, by a more refined mode of examination than\r\nthe production of double images, Arago has been able to infer the\r\nexistence of a similar effect on light in a vast number of bodies.\r\nCrystals have also been found which split up a ray of light entering\r\nthem into two rays, neither of which obeys the laws of Descartes. It\r\nmay, in fact, be said that, with the exception of water, and most other\r\nliquids, of gelatine and other colloidal substances, and of\r\nwell-annealed glass, there are few bodies which do not exercise similar\r\npower on light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 207.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn examining the two rays which emerge from a rhomb of Iceland spar, on\r\nwhich only one ray of ordinary light has been allowed to fall, we find\r\nthat these emergent rays have acquired new and striking properties, of\r\nwhich the incident ray afforded no trace; for, if we allow the two rays\r\nemerging from a rhomb of the spar to fall upon a second rhomb, we shall\r\nfind, on viewing the images produced, that their intensity varies with\r\nthe position into which its second crystal is turned. Thus, if we place\r\na rhomb of the spar upon a dot made on a sheet of white paper, we shall\r\nhave, as already pointed out, two images of equal darkness. But, in\r\nplacing a second rhomb of the spar upon the first, in such a manner that\r\ntheir _principal sections_ coincide, and the faces of one rhomb are also\r\nparallel to the faces of the other, we shall still see _two_ equally\r\nintense images of the dot, only the images will be more widely separated\r\nthan before, and no difference will be produced by separating the\r\ncrystals if the parallelism of the planes of their respective principal\r\nsections be preserved. Here, then, is at once a notable difference\r\nbetween a ray of ordinary light and one that emerges from a rhomb of\r\nIceland spar; for, in the case of rays of ordinary light, we have seen\r\nthat the second rhomb would divide each ray into two, whereas it is\r\nincapable (in the position of crystals under consideration) of dividing\r\neither the ordinary or the extraordinary ray which emerges from the\r\nfirst rhomb. If, still keeping the second rhomb above the other, we make\r\nthe former rotate in a horizontal plane, we may observe that, as we turn\r\nthe upper crystal so that the planes of the _principal sections_ form a\r\nsmall angle with each, each image will be doubled, and, as the upper\r\ncrystal is turned, each pair of images exhibits a varying difference of\r\nintensity. The ordinary ray in entering the second crystal is divided by\r\nit into a second ordinary ray and a second extraordinary ray, the\r\nintensities of which vary according to the angle between the principal\r\nsections. When the two principal sections are parallel to one plane,\r\nthat is, when the angle between them is either 0° or 180°, the\r\nextraordinary image disappears, and only the ordinary one is seen, and\r\nwith its greatest intensity. When the two _principal sections_ are\r\nperpendicular to each other, that is, when the second crystal has been\r\nturned through either 90° or 270°, the extraordinary has, on the\r\ncontrary, its greatest intensity, and the ordinary one disappears. When\r\nthe principal section of the second crystal has been turned into any\r\nintermediate position, such as through 45° and 135°, or any odd multiple\r\nof 45°, both images are visible and have equal intensities. This\r\nexperiment shows that the two rays which emerge from the first crystal\r\nhave acquired new properties, that each is affected differently by the\r\nsecond crystal, according as the crystal is presented to it in different\r\ndirections round the ray as an axis. The ray of light is no longer\r\nuniform in its properties all round, but appears to have acquired\r\ndifferent sides, as it were, in passing through the rhomb of Iceland\r\nspar. This condition is indicated by saying that the ray is _polarized_,\r\nand the first rhomb of spar is termed the _polarizer_, while the second\r\nrhomb, by which we recognize the fact that both the _ordinary_ and the\r\n_extraordinary_ rays emerge having different sides, has received the\r\nname of _analyser_. But, in order to study conveniently all the\r\nphenomena in Iceland spar, we should have crystals of a considerable\r\nsize, otherwise the two rays do not become sufficiently separated so as\r\nto make it an easy matter to intercept one of them while we examine the\r\nother. A very ingenious mode of getting rid of one of the rays was\r\ndevised by Nicol, and as his apparatus is much used for experiments on\r\npolarized light, we shall state the mode of constructing _Nicol’s\r\nPrism_. It is made from a rhomb of Iceland spar, Fig. 207, in which _a_\r\nand _b_ are the corners where the three obtuse angles meet, all equal.\r\nIf we draw through _a_ and _b_ lines bisecting the angles _d a c_ and _f\r\nh g_, and join _a b_, these lines will all be in one plane, which is a\r\nprincipal section of the crystal, and contains the axis, _a b_. Now\r\nsuppose another plane, passing through _a b_, to be turned so that it is\r\nat right angles to the plane containing _a b_ and the bisectors: this\r\nplane would cut the sides of the crystal in the lines _a i_, _i h_, _b\r\nk_, _k a_; and in making the Nicol prism, the crystal is cut into two\r\nalong this plane, and the two pieces are then cemented together by\r\n_Canada balsam_. A ray of light, R, entering the prism, undergoes double\r\nrefraction; but the ordinary ray, meeting the surface of the Canada\r\nbalsam at a certain angle greater than the limiting angle, is totally\r\nreflected, and passes out of the crystal at O; while the extraordinary\r\nray, meeting the layer of balsam at a less angle than _its_ limiting\r\nangle, does not undergo total reflection, but passes through the balsam,\r\nand emerges in the direction of E, completely polarized, so that the ray\r\nis unable to penetrate another Nicol’s prism of which the principal\r\nsection is placed at right angles to that of the first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 208.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong other crystals which possess the property of doubly refracting,\r\nand therefore of polarizing, is the mineral called _tourmaline_, which\r\nis a semi-transparent substance, different specimens having different\r\ntints. In Fig. 208, A, B, represent the prismatic crystals of\r\ntourmaline, and C shows a crystal which has been cut, by means of a\r\nlapidary’s wheel, into four pieces, the planes of division being\r\nparallel to the axis of the prism. The two inner portions form slices,\r\nhaving a uniform thickness of about 1/20 in., and when the faces of\r\nthese have been polished, the plates form a convenient polarizer and\r\nanalyser. Let us imagine one of the plates placed perpendicularly\r\nbetween the eye and a lighted candle. The light will be seen distinctly\r\nthrough it, partaking, however, of the colour of the tourmaline; and if\r\nthe plate be turned round so that the direction of the axis of the\r\ncrystal takes all possible positions with regard to the horizon, while\r\nthe plane of the plate is always perpendicular to the line between the\r\neye and the candle, _no change whatever will be seen in the appearance\r\nof the flame_. But if we fix the plate of crystal in a given position,\r\nlet us say with the axial direction vertical, and place between it and\r\nthe eye the second plate of tourmaline, the appearances become very\r\ncurious indeed, and _the candle is visible or invisible according to the\r\nposition of this second plate_. When the axis of the second is, like\r\nthat of the first, vertical, the candle is distinctly seen; but when the\r\naxis of the second plate is horizontal, no rays from the candle can\r\nreach the eye. If the second plate be slowly turned in its own plane,\r\nthe candle becomes visible or invisible at each quarter of a revolution,\r\nthe image passing through all degrees of brightness. Thus the luminous\r\nrays which pass through the first plate are polarized like those which\r\nemerge from a crystal of Iceland spar. It is not necessary that the\r\nplates used should be cut from the same crystal of tourmaline, for any\r\ntwo plates will answer equally well which have been cut parallel to the\r\naxes of the crystals which furnished them. In the case of tourmaline the\r\nextraordinary ray possesses the power of penetrating the substance of\r\nthe crystal much more freely than the ordinary ray, which a small\r\nthickness suffices to absorb altogether. It may be noted that in the\r\nsimple experiment we have just described, the plate of tourmaline next\r\nthe candle forms the _polarizer_, and that next the eye the _analyser_;\r\nand that until the latter was employed, the eye was quite incapable of\r\ndetecting the change which the light had undergone in passing through\r\nthe first plate, for the unassisted eye had no means of recognizing that\r\nthe rays emerged with sides. The usual manner of examining light, to\r\nfind whether it is polarized, is to look through a plate of tourmaline\r\nor a Nicol’s prism, and observe whether any change in brightness takes\r\nplace as the prism or plate is rotated. Now, it so happened that in 1808\r\na very eminent French man of science, named Malus, was looking through a\r\ncrystal of Iceland spar, and seeing in the glass panes of the windows of\r\nthe Luxembourg Palace, which was opposite his house, the image of the\r\nsetting sun, he turned the crystal towards the windows, and instead of\r\nthe two bright images he expected to see, he perceived only one; and on\r\nturning the crystal a quarter of a revolution, this one vanished as the\r\nother image appeared. It was, indeed, by a careful analysis of this\r\nphenomenon that Malus founded a new branch of science, namely, that\r\nwhich treats of polarized light; and his views soon led to other\r\ndiscoveries, which, with their theoretical investigations, constitute\r\none of the most interesting departments of optical science, as\r\nremarkable for the grasp it gives of the theory of light as for the\r\nnumber of practical applications to which it has led.\r\n\r\nThe accidental observation of Malus led to the discovery that when a ray\r\nof ordinary light falls obliquely on a mirror—not of metal, but of any\r\nother polished surface, such as glass, wood, ivory, marble, or\r\nleather—it acquires by reflection at the surface the same properties\r\nthat it would acquire by passing through a Nicol’s prism or a plate of\r\ntourmaline: in a word, it is polarized. Thus, if a ray of light is\r\nallowed to fall upon a mirror of black glass at an angle of incidence of\r\n54° 35´, the reflected ray will be found to be polarized in the plane of\r\nreflection—that is, it will pass freely through a Nicol’s prism when the\r\nprincipal section is parallel to the plane of reflection; but when it is\r\nat right angles to the latter, the reflected ray will be completely\r\nextinguished by the prism—that is, it is completely polarized. If the\r\nangle of the incident ray is different from 54° 35´, then the reflected\r\nray is not completely intercepted by the prism—it is not completely but\r\nonly partially polarized. The angle at which maximum polarization takes\r\nplace varies with the reflecting substance; thus, for water it is 53°,\r\nfor diamond 68°, for air 45°. A simple law was discovered by Sir David\r\nBrewster by which the polarizing angle of every substance is connected\r\nwith its refractive index, so that when one is known, the other may be\r\ndeduced. It may be expressed by saying that the polarizing angle is that\r\nangle of incidence which makes the reflected and the refracted rays\r\nperpendicular to each other. The refracted rays are also found to be\r\npolarized in a plane perpendicular to that of reflection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 209.—_Polariscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 210.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 211.—_Iceland Spar showing Double Refraction._\r\n]\r\n\r\nInstruments of various forms have been devised for examining the\r\nphenomena of polarized light. They all consist essentially of a\r\npolarizer and an analyser, which may be two mirrors of black glass\r\nplaced at the polarizing angle, or two bundles of thin glass plates, or\r\ntwo Nicol’s prisms, or two plates of tourmaline, or any pair formed by\r\ntwo of these. Fig. 209 represents a polariscope, this instrument being\r\ndesigned to permit any desired combination of polarizer and analyser,\r\nand having graduations for measuring the angles, and a stage upon which\r\nmay be placed various substances in order to observe the effects of\r\npolarized light when transmitted through them. It is found that thin\r\nslices of crystals placed between the polarizer and analyser exhibit\r\nvaried and beautiful effects of colour, and by such effects the doubly\r\nrefracting power of substances can be recognized, where the observation\r\nof the production of double images would, on account of their small\r\nseparation, be impossible. And the polariscope is of great service in\r\nrevealing structures in bodies which with ordinary light appear entirely\r\ndevoid of it—such, for example, as quill, horn, whalebone, &c. Except\r\nliquids, well-annealed glass, and gelatinous substances, there are, in\r\nfact, few bodies in which polarized light does not show us the existence\r\nof some kind of structure. A very interesting experiment can be made by\r\nplacing in the apparatus, shown in Fig. 210, a square bar of\r\nwell-annealed glass; on examining it by polarized light, it will be\r\nfound that before any pressure from the screw C is applied to the glass,\r\nit allows the light to pass equally through every part of it; but when\r\nby turning the screw the particles have been thrown into a state of\r\nstrain, as shown in the figure, distinct bands will make their\r\nappearance, arranged somewhat in the manner represented; but the shapes\r\nof the figures thus produced vary with every change in the strain and in\r\nthe mode of applying the pressure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 212.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _CAUSE OF LIGHT AND COLOUR._\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto limited ourselves to a description of some of the\r\nphenomena of light, without entering into any explanation of their\r\npresumed causes, or without making any statements concerning the nature\r\nof the agent which produces the phenomena. Whatever this cause or agent\r\nmay be, we know already that light requires time for its propagation,\r\nand two principal theories have been proposed to explain and connect the\r\nfacts. The first supposes light to consist of very subtile matter shot\r\noff from luminous bodies with the observed velocity of light; and the\r\nsecond theory, which has received its great development during the\r\npresent century, regards luminous effects as being due to movements of\r\nthe particles of a subtile fluid to which the name of “ether” has been\r\ngiven. Of the existence of this ether there is no proof: it is imagined;\r\nand properties are assigned to it for no other reason than that if it\r\ndid exist and possess these properties, most of the phenomena of light\r\ncould be easily explained. This theory requires us to suppose that a\r\nsubtile imponderable fluid pervades all space, and even interpenetrates\r\nbodies—gaseous, liquid, and solid; that this fluid is enormously\r\nelastic, for that it resists compression with a force almost beyond\r\ncalculation. The particles of luminous bodies, themselves in rapid\r\nvibratory motion, are supposed to communicate movement to the particles\r\nof the ether, which are displaced from a position of equilibrium, to\r\nwhich they return, executing backwards and forwards movements, like the\r\nstalks of corn in a field over which a gust of wind passes. While an\r\nethereal particle is performing a complete oscillation, a series of\r\nothers, to which it has communicated its motion, are also performing\r\noscillations in various phases—the adjacent particle being a little\r\nbehind the first, the next a little behind the second, and so on, until,\r\nin the file of particles, we come to one which is in the same phase of\r\nits oscillation as the first one. The distance of this from the first is\r\ncalled the “length of the luminous wave.” But the ether particles do\r\nnot, like the ears of corn, sway backwards and forwards merely in the\r\ndirection in which the wave itself advances: they perform their\r\nmovements in a direction perpendicular to that in which the wave moves.\r\nThis kind of movement may be exemplified by the undulation into which a\r\nlong cord laid on the ground may be thrown when one end is violently\r\njerked up and down, when a wave will be seen to travel along the cord,\r\nbut each part of the latter only moves perpendicularly to the length.\r\nThe same kind of undulation is produced on the surface of water when a\r\nstone is thrown into a quiet pool. In each of these cases the parts of\r\nthe rope or of the water do not travel along with the wave, but each\r\nparticle oscillates up and down. Now, it may sometimes be observed, when\r\nthe waves are spreading out on the surface of a pool from the point\r\nwhere a stone has been dropped in, that another set of waves of equal\r\nheight originating at another point may so meet the first set, that the\r\ncrests of one set correspond with the hollows of the other, and thus\r\nstrips of nearly smooth water are produced by the superposition of the\r\ntwo sets of waves. Let Fig. 212 represent two systems of such waves\r\npropagated from the two points A A, the lines representing the crests of\r\nthe waves. Along the lines, _b b_, the crests of one set of waves are\r\njust over the hollows of the other set; so that along these lines the\r\nsurface would be smooth, while along C C the crests would have double\r\nthe height. Now, if light be due to undulation, it should be possible to\r\nobtain a similar effect—that is, to make two sets of luminous\r\nundulations destroy each other’s effects and produce darkness: in other\r\nwords, we should be able, _by adding light to light, to produce\r\ndarkness!_ Now, this is precisely what is done in a celebrated\r\nexperiment devised by Fresnel, which not only proves that darkness may\r\nbe produced by the meeting of rays of light, but actually enables us to\r\nmeasure the lengths of the undulations which produce the rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 213.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 213 is a diagram representing the experiment of the two mirrors,\r\ndevised by Fresnel. We are supposed to be looking down upon the\r\narrangement: the two plane mirrors, which are placed vertically, being\r\nseen edgeways, in the lines, M O, O N, and it will be observed that the\r\nmirrors are placed _nearly_ in the same upright plane, or, in other\r\nwords, they form an angle with each other, which is nearly 180°. At L is\r\na very narrow upright slit, formed by metallic straight-edges, placed\r\nvery close together, and allowing a direct beam of sunlight to pass into\r\nthe apartment, this being the only light which is permitted to enter.\r\nFrom what has been already said on reflection from plane mirrors, it\r\nwill readily be understood that these mirrors will reflect the beams\r\nfrom the slit in such a manner as to produce the same effect, in every\r\nway, as if there were a real slit placed behind each mirror in the\r\nsymmetrical positions, A and B. Each virtual image of the slit may,\r\ntherefore, be regarded as a real source of light at A and at B; thus,\r\nfor example, it will be observed that the actual lengths of the paths\r\ntraversed by the beams which enter at L, and are reflected from the\r\nmirrors, are precisely the same as if they came from A and B\r\nrespectively. The virtual images may be made to approach as near to each\r\nother as may be required, by increasing the angle between the two\r\nmirrors, for, when this becomes 180°, that is, when the two mirrors are\r\nin one plane, the two images will coincide. If, now, a screen be placed\r\nas at F G, a very remarkable effect will be seen; for, instead of simply\r\nthe images of the two slits, there will be visible a number of vertical\r\ncoloured bands, like portions of very narrow rainbows, and these\r\ncoloured bands are due to the two sources of light, A and B; for, if we\r\ncover or remove one of the mirrors, the bands will disappear and the\r\nsimple image of the slit will be seen. If, however, we place in front of\r\nL a piece of coloured glass, say red, we shall no longer see\r\nrainbow-like bands on the screen, but in their place we shall find a\r\nnumber of strips of red light and dark spaces alternately, and, as\r\nbefore, these are found to depend upon the _two_ luminous sources, A and\r\nB. We must, therefore, come to the conclusion that the two rays exercise\r\na mutual effect, and that, by their superposition, they produce darkness\r\nat some points and light at others. These alternate dark and light bands\r\nare formed on the screen at all distances, and the spaces between them\r\nare greater as the two images, A and B, are nearer together. Further,\r\nwith the same disposition of the apparatus, it is found that when yellow\r\nlight is used instead of red, the bands are closer together; when green\r\nglass is substituted for yellow, blue for green, and violet for blue,\r\nthat the bands become closer and closer with each colour successively.\r\nHence, the effect of coloured bands, which is produced when pure\r\nsunlight is allowed to enter at L, is due to the superposition of the\r\nvarious coloured rays from the white light. Let us return to the case of\r\nthe red glass, and suppose that the distance apart of the two images, A\r\nand B, has been measured, by observing the angle which they subtend at\r\nC, and by measuring the distance, C O D, or rather, the distance C O L.\r\nNow, the distances of A and B from the centre of each dark band, and of\r\neach light band, can easily be calculated, and it is found that the\r\n_difference between the two distances_ is always the same for the same\r\nband, however the screen or the mirrors may be changed. On comparing the\r\n_differences_ of the distances of A and B in case of bright bands, with\r\nthose in the case of dark ones, it was found that the former could be\r\nexpressed by the even multiples of a very small distance, which we will\r\ncall _d_, thus:\r\n\r\n                     0, 2_d_, 4_d_, 6_d_, 8_d_, ...\r\n\r\nwhile the differences for the dark bands followed the odd multiples of\r\nthe same quantity, _d_, thus:\r\n\r\n                   _d_, 3_d_, 5_d_, 7_d_, 9_d_, ....\r\n\r\nThese results are perfectly explained on the supposition that light is a\r\nkind of wave motion, and that the distance, _d_, corresponds to _half\r\nthe length of a wave_. We have the waves entering L, and pursuing\r\ndifferent lengths of path to reach the screen at F G, and, if they\r\narrive in opposite phases of undulation, the superposition of two will\r\nproduce darkness. The undulations will plainly be in opposite phases\r\nwhen the lengths of paths differ by an _odd_ number of _half-wave_\r\nlengths, but in the same phase when they differ by an _even_ number.\r\nHence, the length of the wave may be deduced from the measurement of the\r\ndistances of A and B from each dark and light band, and it is found to\r\ndiffer with the colour of the light. It is also plain that, as we know\r\nthe velocity of light, and also the length of the waves, we have only to\r\ndivide the length that light passes over in one second, by the lengths\r\nof the waves, in order to find how many undulations must take place in\r\none second. The following table gives the wave-lengths, and the number\r\nof undulations for each colour:\r\n\r\n                  ┌───────┬──────┬───────────────────┐\r\n                  │Colour.│Number│     Number of     │\r\n                  │       │  of  │Oscillations in one│\r\n                  │       │Waves │      second.      │\r\n                  │       │in one│                   │\r\n                  │       │inch. │                   │\r\n                  ├───────┼──────┼───────────────────┤\r\n                  │Red    │40,960│514,000,000,000,000│\r\n                  │Orange │43,560│557,000,000,000,000│\r\n                  │Yellow │46,090│578,000,000,000,000│\r\n                  │Green  │49,600│621,000,000,000,000│\r\n                  │Blue   │53,470│670,000,000,000,000│\r\n                  │Indigo │56,560│709,000,000,000,000│\r\n                  │Violet │60,040│750,000,000,000,000│\r\n                  └───────┴──────┴───────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThese are the results, then, of such experiments as that of Fresnel’s,\r\nand although such numbers as those given in the table above are apt to\r\nbe considered as representing rather the exercise of scientific\r\nimagination than as real magnitudes actually measured, yet the reader\r\nneed only go carefully over the account of the experiment, and over that\r\nof the measurement of the velocity of light, to become convinced that by\r\nthese experiments _something_ concerned in the phenomena of light has\r\nreally been measured, and has the dimensions assigned to it, even if it\r\nbe not actually the distance from crest to crest of ether waves—even,\r\nindeed, if the ether and its waves have no existence. But by picturing\r\nto ourselves light as produced by the swaying backwards and forwards of\r\nparticles of ether, we are better able to think upon the subject, and we\r\ncan represent to ourselves the whole of the phenomena by a few simple\r\nand comparatively familiar conceptions.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the facility with which the ether theory lends itself\r\nto aiding our notions of the phenomena of light, take the explanation of\r\npolarization. Let us suppose that we are looking at a ray of light along\r\nits direction, and that we can see the particles of ether. We should, in\r\nsuch a case, see them vibrating in planes having every direction, and\r\ntheir paths, as so seen, would be represented by an indefinite number of\r\nthe diameters of a circle. Now, suppose we make the ray first pass\r\nthrough a rhomb of Iceland spar: we should, if we could see the\r\nvibrating particles in the emergent ordinary and extraordinary rays,\r\nperceive them swaying backwards and forwards across the direction of the\r\nrays in two planes only, as represented by the lines, B D and A C, in\r\nthe two circles, O _o_ and E _e_, Fig. 214–-that is, half the particles\r\nwould be vibrating in the direction B D, and the other half in the\r\ndirection A C; and further, the two directions would be at right angles\r\nto each other—the vibrations forming the extraordinary ray being\r\nperformed in a plane at right angles to that in which the vibrations\r\nproducing the ordinary ray take place. If—these planes being in the\r\nposition indicated in 1, Fig. 214–-we turn the crystal round through\r\n90°, they would rotate with it, and would come severally into the\r\nposition shown in 2, Fig. 214.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 214.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was at one time objected to the theory which represents light as due\r\nto wave-like movements that, just as the vibrations which constitute\r\nsound spread in all directions, and go round intercepting bodies,\r\nenabling us, for example, to hear the sound of a bell even when a\r\nbuilding intervenes, so if vibrations really produce light, these would\r\nextend within the shadows, and we ought to perceive light within the\r\nshadows, bending, as it were, round the edge of the shadow-casting body.\r\nThis objection, which at one time presented a great difficulty for the\r\nwave theory, was triumphantly removed by the discovery that the luminous\r\nvibrations do extend into the shadow, and that this is in reality never\r\ncompletely dark. It is true that, although we can hear round a corner,\r\nwe are in general unable to see round it; but it should be noticed that\r\nin the case of hearing, the sound is much weakened by intervening\r\nobjects, and that there are what may be termed _sound shadows_. A ray of\r\nlight produces sensible effects only in the direction of its\r\npropagation; but it can be shown that the successive portions of the\r\nwaves advancing along it are centres of lateral disturbances producing\r\nnew or secondary waves in all directions, which, however, interfere with\r\nand destroy each other. When an opaque screen intercepts a portion of\r\nthe principal wave, it also stops a number of oblique or secondary\r\nwaves, which would interfere more or less with the rest. Under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, the remaining oblique or secondary rays are quite\r\ninsensible in the presence of the direct light. But, with an apparatus\r\nwhich will cost but the two or three minutes’ time required to construct\r\nit, the reader may see for himself that light is able to _pass round an\r\nobstacle_, and he may witness directly phenomena of the same order as\r\nthose presented in the experiment of Fresnel’s mirrors, which require\r\ncostly apparatus for their production. He has only to take two fragments\r\nof common window-glass, and having made a piece of tinfoil adhere to one\r\nsurface of each piece of glass, cut, with a sharp penknife, the finest\r\npossible slit in each piece of tinfoil, making the slit from ½ in. to 1\r\nin. in length. If he will then hold one piece of glass about 2 ft. from\r\nhis eye, so that it may be in the line between his eye and the sun (or\r\nother luminous body), and hold the other piece close to his eye with its\r\nslit parallel to that in the first piece, he will see the latter not\r\nsimply as a line of light, but parallel to it a number of\r\nbrilliantly-coloured rainbow-like bands will be seen on either side. If,\r\ninstead of receiving the light from the sun, or from a candle-flame, the\r\nlight given off by a spirit-lamp, with a piece of salt on its wick, be\r\nused, bright yellow stripes will be seen with dark spaces between them.\r\nOr, if the piece of glass next the sun be red-coloured, instead of plain\r\nglass, no rainbow-like bands will be visible, but a number of bright red\r\nstripes alternating with dark bands will be seen. The reader will have\r\nprobably now little difficulty in perceiving that these can be easily\r\nexplained as the results of interferences of a kind quite analogous to\r\nthose of the waves of water represented in the diagram, Fig. 212. The\r\nrainbow-like stripes are due to the different wave-lengths of the\r\ndifferent colours, as a consequence of which the bright and dark bands\r\nwould be formed at different positions. Our limits do not admit of a\r\nfull explanation of these beautiful effects, but the reader requiring\r\nfurther information would peruse with the greatest advantage portions of\r\nSir John Herschel’s “Familiar Lectures on Scientific Subjects.”\r\n\r\nThe undulatory theory gives also an easy explanation of colours; they\r\nbeing, according to the theory, only the effects, as already stated, of\r\nthe different rates of vibrations of the ether. If the ether particles\r\nperform 514,000,000,000,000 oscillations in a second, we receive the\r\nimpression we call red colour; if they execute 750,000,000,000,000\r\nvibrations, the impression produced on our organ of sight is\r\ndifferent—we call it violet; and so on. Thus science teaches us that\r\nvisual impressions so different as red, green, blue, violet, and other\r\ndistinct colours, are, in reality, all due to movements of one and the\r\nsame——something; and that the different sensations of colour we\r\nexperience, arise merely from different rates of recurrence in these\r\nmovements. In the subsequent article we shall have occasion to show that\r\nordinary light, such as that of the sun, or of a candle, contains rays\r\nof every imaginable colour, mixed together in such proportions, that\r\nwhen this light falls upon a piece of paper, or upon snow, we have, in\r\nlooking at these objects, the sensation of _whiteness_. But, if the\r\nlight falls upon any substance which is able, in some way, to absorb or\r\ndestroy some of the vibrations, the admixture of which makes up “_white\r\nlight_,” as it is called, then that object sending back to our eyes the\r\nrays formed of the remaining group of vibrations, gives us the sensation\r\nof _colour_. Suppose, for example, a substance to be so constituted that\r\nit is capable of absorbing, or quenching in some way, all the vibrations\r\nof the ether which occur at a quicker rate than 520,000,000,000,000 in a\r\nsecond: such a substance would send back to our eyes only the vibrations\r\nwhich constitute red light (see table, page 411), and we should say the\r\nsubstance in question had a _red_ colour. Similarly, if the substance\r\ngave back only the vibrations which have the quickest rates, we should\r\ncall the substance of a _violet_ character. The agent which produces in\r\nour visual organs the impression of colour is, therefore, not in the\r\nobjects, but in the light which falls upon them. The rose is red, not\r\nbecause it has redness in itself, but because the light which falls upon\r\nit contains some rays in which there are movements that occur just the\r\nnumber of times per second that gives us the impression we call redness;\r\nin short, the colour comes not from the flower but from the light.\r\n“But,” the reader might say, “the rose is always red by whatever light I\r\nsee it, and therefore the colour must be in the flower. Whether I view\r\nit by sunlight, or moonlight, or candlelight, or gaslight, I invariably\r\nsee that _it is red_.” Now, it is precisely this circumstance—the\r\nseemingly invariable association of the object with a certain\r\nimpression—in this case, redness—that leads our judgment astray, and\r\nmakes us believe that the colour is in the object. Most people live out\r\ntheir lives without anything occurring to them which would give them the\r\nleast idea that the colours of the objects they see around them are not\r\nin these objects themselves, but are derived from the light that falls\r\nupon the objects. And it required the comparison of many observations\r\nand experiments, and some clear reasoning, to establish a truth so\r\nunlike the most settled convictions of ordinary minds.\r\n\r\nThe point in question is fortunately one extremely easy of experiment,\r\nsince we have simple means of producing light in which the vibrations\r\ncorresponding to only one colour are present. The reader is strongly\r\nrecommended to try the following experiment for himself. Let him procure\r\na spirit-lamp, and place on the wick a piece of common salt about as\r\nlarge as a pea. Let the lamp be lighted in a room from which all other\r\nlight is completely excluded, and bring near the flame a red rose or a\r\nscarlet geranium. The flower will be seen with _all its redness gone_—it\r\nwill appear of an ashy grey or leaden colour. A ball of bright scarlet\r\nwool, such as ladies use to work brilliant patterns for cushions, &c.,\r\nheld near this flame, is apparently transformed into a ball of the\r\nhomely grey worsted with which, about a century ago, old ladies might be\r\nseen industriously darning stockings. The experiment is, perhaps, even\r\nmore striking when, a little distance from the spirit-lamp, is placed a\r\nfeeble light of the ordinary kind, a rushlight for example. The ball of\r\nwool, held near the latter, shows vivid scarlet, but, brought near the\r\nspirit-lamp with the salted wick, is pale, ashy grey. Moving thus the\r\nball of worsted, first to one light then to the other, gives a most\r\nconvincing and striking proof of the entire illusion we are under as to\r\ncolour being an inherent quality of substances. Similar experiments may\r\nbe multiplied indefinitely. A bouquet, viewed by the rushlight, shows\r\nthe so-called _natural_ colours of the flowers; viewed by the salted\r\nflame, roses, verbenas, violets, larkspurs, and leaves, all appear of\r\nthe uniform ashy grey, and only _yellow_ flowers come out in their\r\n_natural_ colours. A picture, say a chromo-lithograph after one of the\r\nmost gorgeous landscapes that Turner ever painted, appears a work in\r\nmonochrome, and gives exactly the effect of a sepia or indian-ink\r\ndrawing. The most blooming complexion vanishes, and the countenance\r\nassumes a cadaverous aspect very startling to persons of weak nerves;\r\nthe lips especially, which might have rivalled pink coral by ordinary\r\nlight, take a repulsive livid hue. All these effects may be seen to\r\ngreater advantage by using the gas-flame of a Bunsen’s burner, having a\r\nlump of salt placed in the flame; or by means of a piece of _fine_ wire\r\ngauze, about six inches square, supported about two or three inches\r\nabove an ordinary gas-burner, from which the gas is allowed to issue\r\nwithout being lighted, but when to the top of the wire gauze, which is\r\nstrewed with small fragments of salt, a light is applied, the gas will\r\nignite only above the gauze, without the flame passing down to the\r\nburner below.\r\n\r\nA fuller explanation of these strange appearances may be gathered from\r\nthe subsequent article; but it may suffice now to state that spirit, or\r\ngas burned in the way we have indicated, gives off little or no light of\r\nany kind. If, however, common salt be introduced into the flame, then\r\nlight—but light of only one particular colour—is given off, and that\r\ncolour is yellow. There are no red, or green, or blue, or violet\r\nvibrations given off; and as the objects on which the light falls cannot\r\nsupply these, it follows that with this light no impression\r\ncorresponding to these colours can be produced on the eye, whatever may\r\nbe the objects upon which it falls. Such experiments, not simply read\r\nabout but actually performed, cannot fail to convince an intelligent\r\nperson that the colours come from the light and not from the object. Of\r\ncourse, it is not denied that there is in each substance something that\r\ndetermines which are the rays absorbed, and which are the rays reflected\r\nto the eye—something that can destroy certain waves, but is powerless\r\nover others that rebound from the substance, and reaching the eye, there\r\nproduce their characteristic impressions. And it is but this power of\r\nsending back only certain rays among the multitude which a sunbeam\r\nfurnishes, that can be attributed to objects when we say that they have\r\nsuch or such a colour. In this sense, then, we may properly say that\r\n_the rose is red_, but it is also at the same time undeniably true that\r\n_the redness is not in the rose_.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed that such scientific conclusions as those we have\r\narrived at tend in any way to rob Nature of her beauty, or that our\r\nsense of the loveliness of colour is in any danger of being blunted by\r\nthus tracing out, as far as may be, the causes and sources of our\r\nsensations. The poets have occasionally said harsh things of\r\nscience—indeed, one goes so far as to stigmatize the man of science as\r\none who would “untwist the rainbow” and “botanize upon his mother’s\r\ngrave;” and another thus laments dispelled illusions:\r\n\r\n                 “When Science from Creation’s face\r\n                   Enchantment’s veil withdraws,\r\n                 What lovely visions yield their place\r\n                   To cold material laws!”\r\n\r\nNow, in the case we have been considering, the scientific view is surely\r\nas beautiful as the ordinary one. We can, it is true, no longer regard\r\nthe objects as having in themselves the colours which common observation\r\nattributes to them, but we look upon the material world as being, so to\r\nspeak, the neutral canvas upon which Light, the great painter, spreads\r\nhis varied tints, although, unlike the real canvas of an artist, which\r\nis not only neutral, but receives indifferently whatever hues are laid\r\nupon it, the objects around us exercise a selective effect—as if the\r\npicture of Nature were produced by each part of the canvas refusing all\r\nthe tints save one, but itself supplying none. The tendency of the study\r\nof science to increase our interest in the great spectacle of Nature,\r\nand to enhance our appreciation of her charms, has been more justly\r\nindicated by another poet—thus:\r\n\r\n                                       “Nor ever yet\r\n             The melting rainbow’s vernal tinctured hues\r\n             To me have shone so pleasing, as when first\r\n             The hand of Science pointed out the path\r\n             In which the sunbeams gleaming from the west\r\n             Fall on the watery cloud, whose darksome veil\r\n             Involves the orient.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 215.—_Portrait of Professor Kirchhoff._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SPECTROSCOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the modern discoveries and inventions already described in these\r\npages have been instances of practical applications of science to the\r\nevery-day wants of mankind; but the chief interest of the subject we now\r\nenter upon flows mainly from other sources than direct applications of\r\nits principles in useful arts, although these applications are already\r\nneither few nor unimportant. But that which, in the highest degree,\r\nclaims our attention and excites our admiration in the revelations of\r\nthe spectroscope is the wonderful and wholly unexpected extent to which\r\nthis instrument has enlarged our knowledge of the universe, and the\r\napparently inadequate means by which this has been accomplished. A\r\nlittle triangular piece of glass gives us power to rob the stars of\r\ntheir secrets, and tells more about those distant orbs than the wildest\r\nimagination could have deemed attainable to human knowledge. One of the\r\nmost acute philosophers of the present century, a profound thinker who\r\ndevoted his mind to the consideration of the mutual relations of the\r\nsciences, declared emphatically, not very many years ago, that all we\r\ncould know of the heavenly bodies must ever be confined to an\r\nacquaintance with their motions, and to such a limited acquaintance with\r\ntheir features as the telescope reveals in the less distant ones. A\r\nknowledge of their composition, he expressly asserted, could never be\r\nattained, for we could have no means of chemically examining the matter\r\nof which they are constituted. Such was the deliberate utterance of a\r\nman by no means disposed to underrate the power of the human mind in the\r\npursuit of truth. And such might still have been the opinion of the\r\nlearned and of the unlearned, but for the remarkable train of\r\ndiscoveries which has led us to the construction of instruments\r\nrevealing to us the nature of the substances entering into the\r\nconstitution of the heavenly bodies. We have now, for example, the same\r\ncertainty about the existence of iron in our sun, that we have about its\r\nexistence in the poker and tongs on the hearth. The last few years have\r\nseen the dawn of a new science; and two branches of knowledge which\r\nformerly seemed far as the poles asunder—namely, astronomy and\r\nchemistry—have their interests united in this new science of celestial\r\nchemistry. The progress which has been made in this department of\r\nspectroscopic research is so rapid, and the field is so promising, that\r\nthe well-instructed juvenile of the future, instead of idly repeating\r\nthe simple lay of _our_ childhood:\r\n\r\n                    “Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\r\n                    How I _wonder_ what you are!”\r\n\r\nwill probably only have to direct his sidereal spectroscope to the\r\nobject of his admiration in order to obtain exact information as to what\r\nthe star is, chemically and physically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 216.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe results which have already been obtained in celestial chemistry, and\r\nother branches of spectroscopic science, are so surprising, and\r\napparently so remote from the range of ordinary experience, that the\r\nreader can only appreciate these wonderful discoveries by tracing the\r\nsteps by which they have been reached. A few fundamental phenomena of\r\nlight have already been spoken of in the foregoing article; and an\r\nacquaintance with these will have prepared the reader’s mind for a\r\nconsideration of the new facts we are about to describe. In discussing,\r\nin the foregoing pages, the subject of refraction, we have, in order\r\nthat the reader’s attention might not be distracted, omitted all mention\r\nof a circumstance attending it, when a beam of ordinary light falls upon\r\na refracting surface, such as that represented in Fig. 203. The laws\r\nthere explained apply, in fact, to elementary rays, and not to ordinary\r\nwhite light, which is a mixture of a vast multitude of elementary rays,\r\nred, yellow, green, &c. When such a beam falls obliquely upon a piece of\r\nglass, the ray is, at its entrance, broken up into its elements, for\r\nthese, being refracted in different degrees by the glass, each pursues a\r\ndifferent path in that medium, as represented by Fig. 216. Each\r\nelementary ray obeys the laws which have been explained, and therefore\r\neach emerges from the second surface of the plate parallel to the\r\nincident ray, and, in consequence of this, the separation is not\r\nperceptible under ordinary circumstances with plates of glass having\r\nparallel surfaces. But, if the second surface be inclined so as to form\r\nsuch an angle with the first that the rays are rendered still more\r\ndivergent in their exit, then the separation of the light into its\r\nelementary coloured rays becomes quite obvious. Such is the arrangement\r\nof the surfaces in a prism, and in the triangular pieces of glass which\r\nare used in lustres.\r\n\r\nFor the fundamental experimental fact of our subject, we must go back\r\ntwo centuries, when we shall find Sir Isaac Newton making his celebrated\r\nanalysis of light by means of the glass prism. We shall describe\r\nNewton’s experiment, for, although it was performed so long ago, and is\r\ngenerally well known, it will render our view of the present subject\r\nmore complete; and it will also serve to impress on the reader an\r\nadditional instance of the world’s indebtedness to that great mind, when\r\nwe thus trace the grand results of modern discovery from their source.\r\n“It is well,” is the remark of a clear thinker and eloquent writer, “to\r\nturn aside from the fretful din of the present, and to dwell with\r\ngratitude and respect upon the services of ‘those mighty men of old, who\r\nhave gone down to the grave with their weapons of war,’ but who, while\r\nthey lived, won splendid victories over ignorance.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 217.—_Newton’s Experiment._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe experiment of Sir Isaac Newton will be readily understood from Fig.\r\n217, where C is the prism, and A C represents the path of a beam of\r\nsunlight allowed to enter into a dark apartment through a small _round_\r\nhole in a shutter, all other light being excluded from the apartment. In\r\nthis position of the prism, the rays into which the sunbeam is broken at\r\nits entrance into the glass were bent upwards, and at their emergence\r\nfrom the glass they were again bent upwards, still more separated, so\r\nthat when a white screen was placed in their path, instead of a white\r\ncircular image of the sun appearing, as would have been the case had the\r\nlight been merely refracted and not split up, Newton saw on the screen\r\nthe variously-coloured band, D D, which he termed the _spectrum_. The\r\nletters in the figure indicate the relative positions of the various\r\ncolours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, &c., by their initial\r\nletters. The spectrum, or prolonged coloured image of the sun, is red at\r\nthe end, R, where the rays are least refracted, and violet at the other\r\nextremity, where the refraction is greatest, while, in the intermediate\r\nspaces, yellow, green, and blue pass by insensible gradations into each\r\nother. Newton varied his experiment in many ways, as, for example, by\r\ntrying the effect of refraction through a second prism on the\r\ndifferently coloured rays. He found that the second prism did not divide\r\nthe yellow rays, for instance, into any other colour, but merely bent\r\nthem out of the straight course, to form on the second screen a somewhat\r\nbroader band of yellow, and similarly with regard to the others. From\r\nthese, and a number of other experiments described in his “Opticks,” (A.\r\nD. 1675), Newton concludes, “that if the sun’s light consisted of but\r\none sort of rays, there would be but one colour in the whole world, nor\r\nwould it be possible to produce any new colour by reflections and\r\nrefractions, and, by consequence, the variety of colours depends upon\r\nthe composition of light.” ... “And if, at any time, I speak of light\r\nand rays, or coloured, or endued with colours, I would be understood to\r\nspeak not philosophically and properly, but grossly, and accordingly to\r\nsuch conceptions as vulgar people in seeing all these experiments would\r\nbe apt to frame. For the rays, to speak properly, are not coloured. In\r\nthem there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir\r\nup a sensation of this or that colour. For, as sound in a bell, a\r\nmusical string, or other sounding body, is nothing but a trembling\r\nmotion, and in the air nothing but that motion propagated from the\r\nobject, and in the sensorium ‘tis a sense of that motion under the form\r\nof a sound; so colours in the object are nothing but a disposition to\r\nreflect this or that sort of rays more copiously than the rest: in the\r\nrays they are nothing but their dispositions to propagate this or that\r\nmotion into the sensorium, and in the sensorium they are sensations of\r\nthese motions under the form of colours.”\r\n\r\nThese memorable investigations of Newton’s have been the admiration of\r\nsucceeding philosophers, and even poets have caught inspiration from\r\nthis theme:\r\n\r\n          “Nor could the darting beam of speed immense\r\n          Escape his swift pursuit and measuring eye.\r\n          E’en Light itself, which everything displays.\r\n          Shone undiscovered, till his brighter mind\r\n          Untwisted all the shining robe of day;\r\n          And, from the whitening undistinguished blaze,\r\n          Collecting every ray into his kind,\r\n          To the charmed eye educed the gorgeous train\r\n          Of parent colours. First the flaming red\r\n          Sprung vivid forth; the tawny orange next;\r\n          And next delicious yellow—by whose side\r\n          Fell the kind beams of all-refreshing green;\r\n          Then the pure blue, that swells autumnal skies,\r\n          Ethereal played; and then, of sadder hue\r\n          Emerged the deepened indigo, as when\r\n          The heavy-skirted evening droops with frost,\r\n          While the last gleamings of refracted light\r\n          Died in the fainting violet away.\r\n          These, when the clouds distil the rosy show,\r\n          Shine out distinct adown the watery bow;\r\n          While o’er our heads the dewy vision bends\r\n          Delightful—melting on the fields beneath.\r\n          Myriads of mingling dyes from these result,\r\n          And myriads still remain.—Infinite source\r\n          Of beauty! ever blushing—ever new!\r\n          Did ever poet image aught so fair,\r\n          Dreaming in whispering groves, by the hoarse brook,\r\n          Or prophet, to whose rapture Heaven descends?”\r\n\r\nThe spectra which Newton obtained by admitting the solar beams through a\r\ncircular aperture, were, however, not simple spectra. The circular beam\r\nmay be considered as built up of flat and very thin bands of light,\r\nparallel to the edges of the prism, and a simple ray would be formed by\r\none of these flat bands; as the round opening would allow an indefinite\r\nnumber of such rays to enter, each would produce its own spectrum on the\r\nscreen, and the actual image would be formed of a number of spectra\r\noverlapping each other. When the aperture by which the light is admitted\r\nconsists merely of a narrow slit, or line, parallel to the edges of the\r\nprism, we obtain what is termed a _pure spectrum_. When the prism is\r\nproperly placed, an eye, viewing the fine slit through it, sees a\r\nspectrum formed, as it were, of a succession of virtual images of the\r\nslit in all the elementary coloured rays.\r\n\r\nThe person who first examined the solar spectrum in this manner was the\r\nEnglish chemist Wollaston, who, in 1802, found that the spectrum thus\r\nobserved was not continuous, but that it was crossed at intervals by\r\ndark lines. Wollaston saw them by placing his eye directly behind the\r\nprism. Twelve years later, namely, in 1814, the German optician\r\nFraunhofer devised a much better mode of viewing the spectrum; for,\r\ninstead of looking through the prism with the naked eye, he used a\r\ntelescope, placing the prism and the telescope at a distance of 24 ft.\r\nfrom the slit, the virtual image of which was thus considerably\r\nmagnified. The prism was so placed that the incident and refracted rays\r\nformed nearly equal angles with its faces, in which circumstance the ray\r\nis least deflected from its direction, and the position is therefore\r\nspoken of as being that of _minimum deviation_. It can be shown that\r\nthis position is the only one in which the refracted rays can produce\r\nclear and sharp virtual images of the slit, and therefore it is\r\nnecessary in all instruments to have the prism so adjusted. Fraunhofer\r\nthen saw that the dark lines were very numerous, and he found that they\r\nalways kept the same relative positions with regard to the coloured\r\nspaces they crossed; that these positions did not change when the\r\nmaterial of which the prism was made was changed; and that a variation\r\nin the refracting angle of the prism did not affect them. He then made a\r\nvery careful map, laying down upon it the position of 354 of the lines\r\nout of about 600 which he counted, and indicated their relative\r\nintensities, for some are finer and less dark than others. The most\r\nconspicuous lines he distinguished by letters of the alphabet, and these\r\nare still so indicated; and the dark lines in the solar spectrum are\r\ncalled “Fraunhofer’s Lines.” These lines, as will appear in the sequel,\r\nare of great importance in our subject. A few of the more obvious ones\r\nare shown in No. 1, Plate XVII. Fraunhofer found that these lines were\r\nalways produced by sunlight, whether direct, or diffused, or reflected\r\nfrom the moon and planets; but that the light from the fixed stars\r\nformed spectra having different lines from those in the sun—although he\r\nrecognized in some of the spectra a few of the same lines he found in\r\nthe solar spectrum. The fact of these differences in the spectra of the\r\nsun and fixed stars proved that the cause of the dark lines, whatever it\r\nmight be, must exist in the light of these self-luminous bodies, and not\r\nin our atmosphere. It was, however, some years afterwards ascertained\r\nthat the passage of the sun’s light through the atmosphere does give\r\nrise to some dark bands in the spectrum; for it was found that certain\r\nlines make their appearance only when the sun is near the horizon, and\r\nits rays consequently pass through a much greater thickness of air.\r\n\r\nSir D. Brewster first noticed in 1832 that certain coloured gases have\r\nthe power of absorbing some of the sun’s rays, so that the spectrum,\r\nwhen the rays are made to pass through such a gas before falling on the\r\nprism, is crossed by a series of dark lines—altogether different from\r\nFraunhofer’s lines, though these are also present. The gas in which this\r\nproperty was first noticed is that called “nitric peroxide”—a\r\nbrownish-red gas, of which even a thin stratum produces a well-marked\r\nseries of dark lines. The same property was soon discovered in the\r\nvapours of bromine, iodine, and a certain compound of chlorine and\r\noxygen. Each substance furnishes a system of lines peculiar to itself:\r\nthus the vapour of bromine, although it has almost exactly the same\r\ncolour as nitric peroxide, gives a totally different set of lines.\r\nThese, therefore, do not depend on the mere colour of the gas or vapour,\r\nand this is conclusively proved by the fact of many coloured vapours\r\nproducing no dark lines whatever: the vapour of tungsten chloride, for\r\nexample, although in colour so exactly like bromine vapour that the two\r\ncannot be distinguished by the eye, yields no lines whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 218.—_Bunsen’s Burner on a stand._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 218 is represented a lamp for burning coal-gas, which is\r\nconstantly used by chemists as a source of heat. It is known as\r\n“Bunsen’s burner,” from its inventor the celebrated German chemist. It\r\nconsists of a metal tube, 3 in. or 4 in. long, and ⅓ in. in diameter, at\r\nthe bottom of which the gas is admitted by a small jet communicating\r\nwith the elastic tube which brings the gas to the apparatus. A little\r\nbelow the level of the jet there are two lateral openings which admit\r\nair to the tube. The gas, therefore, becomes mixed with air within the\r\ntube, and this inflammable mixture streams from the top of the tube and\r\nreadily ignites on the approach of a flame, the mixture burning with a\r\npale bluish flame of a very high temperature. This little apparatus is\r\nnot only the most useful pieces of chemical apparatus ever devised, but\r\nit furnishes highly instructive illustrations of several points in\r\nchemical and physical science; and to some of these we invite the\r\nreader’s attention, as they have an immediate bearing on our present\r\nsubject. Coal-gas is a mixture of various compounds of the two\r\nelementary bodies, hydrogen and carbon; and when the gas burns, these\r\nsubstances are respectively uniting with the oxygen of the air,\r\nproducing water and carbonic acid gas. Now, when coal-gas is burnt in\r\nthe ordinary manner as a source of light, the supply of oxygen is too\r\nsmall to admit of the complete combustion of all its constituents; and\r\nas the oxygen more eagerly seizes upon the hydrogen than upon the\r\ncarbon, a large proportion of the latter thus set free from its hydrogen\r\ncompound is deposited in the flame in the solid form, and is there\r\nintensely heated. The presence of solid carbon in an ordinary gas flame\r\nis easily proved by holding in it a cold fragment of porcelain, or a\r\npiece of metal, which will become covered with soot. In the flame of the\r\nBunsen burner there is no soot, because the increased supply of oxygen,\r\nafforded by previously mixing the gas with air, enables the whole of the\r\nconstituents of the gas to be completely burnt; and this is of the\r\ngreatest advantage to the chemist, who always desires to have the\r\nvessels he heats free from soot, in order that he may observe what is\r\ntaking place within them. The flame of Bunsen’s lamp becomes that of an\r\nordinary sooty gas flame, when the two orifices which admit the air at\r\nthe bottom of the tube are closed up, and then, of course, the\r\ntemperature cannot be so high as when the whole constituents of the gas\r\nare completely burnt, but the flame becomes highly luminous; whereas\r\nwhen the orifices are open it gives so little light, that in a dark room\r\none cannot see a finger held 20 in. from the lamp. Plainly the cause of\r\nthis difference is connected with the presence or absence of the heated\r\nparticles of solid carbon. The non-luminous flame contains no solid\r\nparticles; the bright part of the other flame is full of them. To these\r\nheated particles of solid carbon we are, then, indebted for the light\r\nwhich burning coal-gas supplies. And, since we are able by such\r\nartificial illumination to distinguish colours, the white-hot carbon\r\nmust give off rays of all degrees of refrangibility, and we should\r\nexpect to find in the spectrum produced by such a flame, the red,\r\nyellow, green, and other coloured rays. And such is indeed the spectrum\r\nwhich these incandescent carbon particles produce: it resembles the\r\nsolar spectrum, but _there is an entire absence of dark lines_, so that\r\nthe appearance is that represented in No. 1, Plate XVII., if we suppose\r\nthe Fraunhofer lines removed. If the pale blue flame of the Bunsen’s\r\nburner be similarly examined, the spectrum, No. 14, Plate XVII., shows\r\nthat only a few rays of certain refrangibilities are emitted, forming\r\nbright lines here and there, but of little intensity, while the whole of\r\nthe other rays are absent. This shows that while the highly heated solid\r\ngives off all rays from red to violet without interruption, the still\r\nmore highly heated gases give off only a few selected rays.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that some substances impart certain colours to\r\nflames, and such substances have been long employed to produce coloured\r\neffects in fireworks, &c. But coloured flames do not appear to have been\r\nexamined by the prism until 1822, when Sir John Herschel described the\r\nspectra of strontium, copper, and of some other substances, remarking\r\nthat “The colours thus communicated by the different bases to flame\r\nafford in many cases a ready and neat way of detecting extremely minute\r\nquantities of them.” A few years later, Fox Talbot described the method\r\nof obtaining a monochromatic flame, by using in a spirit-lamp diluted\r\nalcohol in which a little salt has been dissolved. The paper in which he\r\ndescribes this and other observations concludes thus: “If this opinion\r\nshould be correct and applicable to the other definite rays, a glance at\r\nthe prismatic spectrum of flame may show it to contain substances which\r\nit would otherwise require a laborious chemical analysis to detect.”\r\nHere we have the first hint of that spectrum analysis which has provided\r\nthe chemist with a method of surpassing delicacy for the detection of\r\nmetallic elements. The spectra of coloured flames were also subsequently\r\nexamined and described by Professor W. A. Miller, but the most complete\r\ninvestigation into the subject was made by Professors Kirchhoff and\r\nBunsen, who also contrived a convenient instrument, or _spectroscope_,\r\nfor the examination and comparison of different spectra. The instrument\r\nhas received many improvements and modifications, but the essential\r\nparts are one or more prisms; a slit, through which the light to be\r\nexamined is allowed to enter; a tube, having at the other end a lens to\r\nrender parallel the rays from the slit; a telescope, through which the\r\nspectrum is viewed; and usually some apparatus by which the positions of\r\nthe different lines may be identified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVII. SPECTRA.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 219.—_Spectroscope with one Prism._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA very elegant instrument, made by Mr. John Browning, of the Strand, is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 219. It has a single prism, made of glass, of great\r\npower in dispersing the rays. The prism is supported on a little stage,\r\nplaced in the middle of a horizontal circular brass table about 6 in. in\r\ndiameter. On the left is seen a tube, about 15 in. long, at the outer\r\nextremity of which is the slit, formed of pieces of metal very\r\naccurately shaped. One of these pieces slides in a direction at right\r\nangles to the slit, and, by means of a spring and a fine screw, can be\r\nvery nicely adjusted, so that an opening of any degree of fineness can\r\nbe readily obtained. In front of the slit is a small glass prism, with\r\nits edges parallel to the slit, but only half its height. The bases of\r\nthis prism are formed of two sides of a square and its diagonal, and, as\r\nshown in the figure, one side is parallel to the face of the slit, and\r\nthe other to the axis of the tube. Rays of light coming from a source on\r\nthe left of the slit (as seen in the figure) will, therefore, enter this\r\nlittle prism, and be totally reflected (see page 399) by the diagonal\r\nsurface, down the axis of the tube through the lower half only of the\r\nslit. This is the only office of this prism, which has nothing to do\r\nwith the dispersion of the rays: the use to which it is put will be seen\r\npresently. It is fixed in such a manner that, when required, it can be\r\nturned aside with the touch of a finger, and the _whole_ length of the\r\nslit exposed. A peculiarity in these instruments of Mr. Browning’s is\r\nthe admirable arrangement for determining the position of any line in a\r\nspectrum. For this purpose, the eye-piece of the telescope is provided\r\nwith a pair of cross-wires, and the telescope itself, which is about 18\r\nin. in length, moves in a horizontal plane round the axis of the\r\ncircular brass table, from which an arm projects, carrying a ring into\r\nwhich the telescope screws. This arm carries a _vernier_ along the limb\r\nof the circular table, which is very accurately divided into thirds of\r\ndegrees, so that with the aid of the vernier the angular position of the\r\ntelescope can be read off to a minute, that is, to 1/60th of a degree.\r\nThe arm carrying the telescope is provided with a screw for clamping it\r\nin any desired position while the readings are taken. On placing in\r\nfront of the slit the flame of a Bunsen’s burner, the spectrum produced\r\nby any substance in this flame will, when the instrument is in proper\r\nadjustment, be seen on looking through the telescope, and the\r\ncross-wires being also in view, the point of their intersection may be\r\nbrought into coincidence with any line of the spectrum, and the\r\ntelescope being clamped in this position, the angular reading thus taken\r\ndetermines the position of the line. Thus, for example, the angular\r\npositions in which the principal Fraunhofer’s lines are seen having been\r\nobserved and recorded, the angular position of any line in another\r\nspectrum will at once determine its position among the Fraunhofer lines;\r\nor the spectrum may be mapped by laying down the angular readings of the\r\nlines by means of a scale of equal parts. And, again, in the little\r\nprism in front of the slit we have the means of bringing two spectra in\r\nview at once, one being from a light directly in front, and the other\r\nfrom a light at the side. The two spectra are seen one above the other,\r\nand the coincidence or difference of their lines may be directly\r\nobserved. When the instrument is in use, the prism and the ends of the\r\ntube are covered with a black cloth, loosely thrown over them, by which\r\nall stray light is shut out. The author has had in use for several years\r\none of these instruments, and he cannot forbear expressing his perfect\r\nsatisfaction with its powers, which he finds amply sufficient for all\r\nordinary chemical purposes, while the accuracy of the workmanship is\r\nreally wonderful, considering the very moderate price of the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe substances the spectra of which are most conveniently examined are\r\nthe metals of the alkalies and alkaline earths. Small quantities of the\r\nsalts of these metals, placed in a loop of fine platinum wire, impart\r\ncharacteristic colours to the flame of a Bunsen burner or to that of a\r\nspirit-lamp. For the examination of the spectra the former is to be\r\npreferred, as the lines come out much more vividly. Indeed, at\r\ntemperatures higher than that of the Bunsen’s burner, such as in the\r\nflame of pure hydrogen, or in the voltaic arc, some substances give out\r\nadditional lines. In Plate XVII., Nos. 2 to 9, is shown the appearance\r\nof the spectra produced by the Bunsen’s burner when salts of the metals\r\nare held in the flame in the manner already mentioned, and the spectra\r\nare examined with the instrument just described. One of the simplest of\r\nthese spectra is that produced by sodium compounds, such as common salt.\r\nThe smallest particle of this substance imparts an intense yellow colour\r\nto the flame, and the spectrum is found to take the form of a single\r\nbright yellow line—No. 3. It has been estimated that the presence of the\r\n(1/100000000)_th part of a grain_ of sodium can be detected by the\r\nproduction of this line. Indeed, the very delicacy of this sodium\r\nreaction renders it almost impossible to get rid of this line, for\r\nsodium is found to be present in almost everything,—a fact the earlier\r\nobservers of spectra were not aware of, for they attributed this yellow\r\nline to water, which was the only substance they knew to be so generally\r\ndiffused. If a platinum wire be heated in the flame of the Bunsen burner\r\nuntil all the sodium indications have disappeared, it suffices to remove\r\nthe wire, and, without allowing it to come into contact with anything,\r\nto leave it exposed to the air for a few minutes, to cause it again to\r\ngive the characteristic yellow colour when again plunged into the flame.\r\nThis is due to the fact that the element is contained in all the\r\nfloating particles which pervade the atmosphere. The spectroscope is not\r\nrequired to show the presence of the sodium on the platinum which has\r\nbeen exposed to the air, the colour imparted to the flame being plainly\r\nvisible to the eye, and it needs only the Bunsen burner and 2 in. of\r\nplatinum wire to prove the fact, and also to show that mere contact with\r\nthe fingers is enough to highly charge the wire with sodium compounds.\r\nAny volatile compound of potassium gives the spectrum represented by No.\r\n2, the principal lines being a red line and one in the extreme violet,\r\nthe latter being somewhat difficult to observe. There is also a third\r\nrather ill-defined red line, and a portion of a faint continuous\r\nspectrum. Salts of strontium impart a bright red colour to the flame,\r\nand the spectrum they produce is shown by No. 6, in which are seen\r\nseveral bright red lines and a fainter blue one. Calcium, which also\r\ngives a reddish colour to flame, furnishes an entirely different set of\r\nlines (No. 5), and barium salt another, containing numerous lines,\r\nespecially some very vivid green ones.\r\n\r\nIn all the cases we have named, and whenever bright-lined spectra are\r\nfurnished by substances placed in the flame of a lamp, or in burning\r\nhydrogen gas, or in the intensely hot voltaic arc, there is evidence\r\nthat the substances are converted into vapour or gas. We have already\r\nseen how hot solid carbon gives a continuous spectrum, while carbon in\r\nthe state of gaseous combination gives most of the bright lines seen in\r\nthe spectrum of coal-gas (No. 14). It is observed also that the more\r\nreadily volatized are the salts, the more vivid are the bright lines\r\nthey produce when heated in a flame. It must be understood that each\r\nelement gives it own characteristic lines, that these are always in\r\nprecisely the same position in the spectrum, that no substance produces\r\na line in exactly the same position as another, however near two lines\r\ndue to different substances may, in some cases, appear; and also, that\r\nhowever the salts of the different metals are mixed together, each\r\nproduces its own lines, and each ingredient may be recognized. And this\r\nis done in an instant by an experienced observer—a mere glance at the\r\nsuperposed spectra of, perhaps, half a dozen metals, suffices to inform\r\nhim which are present. There is also a peculiarity in this optical mode\r\nof recognizing the presence of bodies which gives the subject the\r\nhighest interest, namely, the circumstance that the spectrum is produced\r\nand the bodies recognized, however far from the observer the luminous\r\ngas may be placed, the only condition required being that the rays reach\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nUntil Kirchhoff and Bunsen’s spectroscopic investigations, lithium was\r\nsupposed to be a rare metal, occurring only in a few minerals. It\r\nhappens that this substance yields a remarkable spectrum (No. 4), for it\r\ngives an extremely vivid line of a splendid red colour, accompanied by\r\nonly one other, a feeble yellow line; and the reaction is of very great\r\ndelicacy, for 1/6000000 of a grain can easily be detected, and an eye\r\nwhich has once seen the red line readily recognizes it again. A single\r\ndrop of a mineral water containing lithium has been found to distinctly\r\nproduce the red line, in cases where the quantity contained in a quart\r\nof the water would have escaped ordinary chemical analysis. The\r\nspectroscope has shown that lithium, so far from occurring in only four\r\nor five minerals, is a substance very widely diffused in nature. In the\r\nwaters of the ocean, in mineral and river waters, in most plants, in\r\nwines, tea, coffee, milk, blood, and muscle, this metal has been found.\r\nDr. Roscoe states that the ash of a cigar, when moistened with\r\nhydrochloric acid, and held in a platinum wire in the flame of the\r\nBunsen’s burner, at once shows the principal lines of sodium, potassium,\r\ncalcium, and lithium. Salts of lithium and of strontium both impart a\r\nrich crimson tint to flames, and it is hardly possible to detect any\r\ndifference in these colours with the naked eye; but, as the reader may\r\nsee on comparing spectra No. 4 and No. 6, the prism makes a wide\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nMatter for a very interesting chapter in the history of prismatic\r\nanalysis has been furnished by the discovery of four new elements by\r\nmeans of the spectroscope. In 1860 Bunsen observed that the residue,\r\nafter evaporation, of a certain mineral water, yielded spectra with\r\nbright lines which he had not seen before. He concluded that they were\r\ndue to some unknown elements, and, in order to separate these, he\r\nevaporated many tons of the water, and was rewarded by the discovery of\r\ntwo alkaline metals, _cæsium_ and _rubidium_. The delicacy of the\r\nspectrum reaction may be inferred from the fact of a ton weight of the\r\nwater containing only three grains of the salts of each of these\r\nsubstances. Rubidium gives a splendid spectrum, containing red, yellow,\r\nand green lines, and also two characteristic violet lines; while cæsium\r\nhas orange, yellow, and green lines, and two very beautiful blue lines,\r\nby which it is easily recognized.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Mr. W. Crookes discovered, in a mineral from the\r\nHartz, another elementary body, the existence of which was first\r\nindicated to him by the characteristic spectrum it produces, namely, a\r\nsingle splendid green line (No. 8 spectrum). In 1864 two German chemists\r\ndiscovered, also in the Hartz, a fourth new element, which was detected\r\nby two well-defined lines in the more refrangible end of the\r\nspectrum—(see spectrum No. 9, in the plate). This metal was named\r\nIndium, in reference to the colour of its lines, and the names of the\r\nother three—cæsium, rubidium, and thallium, are also derived from the\r\ncolours of their characteristic lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 220.—_Miniature Spectroscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlthough the reader may, from such representations of the spectra as\r\nthose given in Plate XVII., form some idea of their appearance, he would\r\nfind his knowledge of the subject much clearer if he had the opportunity\r\nof examining for himself the actual phenomena. We have already\r\nrecommended the performance of certain easy experiments involving no\r\noutlay, but, in the matter of spectroscopes, carefully finished optical\r\nand mechanical work is absolutely necessary in the appliances. It\r\nfortunately happens that one eminent optician, at least, has made it his\r\nstudy to produce good spectroscopic apparatus at the lowest possible\r\ncost, and if the reader be interested in this subject, and desirous of\r\ntrying experiments himself, he can, for a very moderate sum, be equipped\r\nwith all the appliances for examining the phenomena we have described.\r\nHe has only to procure, in the first place, a small direct-vision\r\nspectroscope, such as that represented of its actual size in Fig. 220,\r\nwhich is sold by Mr. Browning for twenty-two shillings; secondly, a\r\nBunsen’s burner, a few feet of india-rubber tubing, two inches of\r\nplatinum wire, and a few grains of the salts of lithium, strontium,\r\nthallium, &c. The whole expense will probably be covered by adding four\r\nshillings to the cost of the spectroscope, and the reader will then be\r\nin a position to see for himself the principal Fraunhofer lines, the\r\nspectra of the metals already referred to, and the absorption bands of\r\nthe gases which have been mentioned, as well as the absorption bands in\r\nliquids which will be spoken of in the sequel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 221.—_The Gassiot Spectroscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe splitting up of a beam of light into its elements—which it is the\r\noffice of the prism to produce—is accomplished by a single prism to a\r\ncertain degree only. It separates the red from the green, for example;\r\nbut the colours pass into each by insensible gradations through orange,\r\nyellow, and greenish yellow. If we allow the rays to fall upon a second\r\nprism after emerging from the first, the separation is carried further;\r\nthe red, for instance, is spread out into different kinds of red, and so\r\non with the rest. And the greater the number of prisms, the greater is\r\nthe extension which is given to the spectrum. Now, just as by increasing\r\nthe power of the telescope, new stars become visible, whose light was\r\nbefore too faint, and nebulæ, or stars which before seemed single, are\r\nresolved into clusters of individual stars—so, by increasing the power\r\nof the spectroscope by employing two, four, or more prisms, lines which\r\nappear single by the less powerful instruments are, in some instances,\r\nresolved into groups of lines, and new lines come into view, which\r\nbefore were too faint to show themselves. For example, if we view the\r\nFraunhofer lines through a spectroscope like that in Fig. 220, but\r\nhaving two prisms instead of one, we shall see that the D line is not\r\nreally a single line, but is formed of two lines close together. If we\r\nuse greater dispersive power by employing a greater number of prisms, we\r\nshall observe with solar light that when these two D lines are\r\nsufficiently separated, several other lines make their appearance\r\nbetween them. In this way the number of dark lines in sunlight, which\r\nhave been carefully mapped by Kirchhoff and others, amount to upwards of\r\n2,000; and no doubt there are many more lines waiting a still more\r\npowerful instrument. Fig. 221 is copied from a large spectroscope made\r\nby Mr. Browning for Mr. Gassiot. It has nine or more highly dispersive\r\nglass prisms; the telescope and the tube bearing the slit have focal\r\nlengths of 18 in., the lenses having a diameter of 1½ in.; the telescope\r\nis provided with a slow motion for taking the angular position; and\r\nthere is a third tube provided with a micrometer, by which the position\r\nof the lines can be measured to 1/10000th of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe instruments we have mentioned, except the miniature spectroscope,\r\nshow only a portion of the spectra at once, a movement of the telescope\r\nbeing requisite to bring each part into view. It has been already stated\r\nthat the only position of the prism which will make the lines clear and\r\nwell defined is that in which the _deviation_ is the least. In using\r\ntrains of prisms it is therefore necessary to adjust each prism for the\r\npart of the spectrum which may be under observation. This is a tedious\r\nprocess, and it has been obviated by a useful invention of Mr.\r\nBrowning’s, by which the adjustment is rendered automatic—that is, the\r\nmovements of the telescope are communicated to the prisms in such a\r\nmanner that they place themselves into the proper position for producing\r\nclear images of the slit, whatever may be the refrangibility of the rays\r\nunder examination: Fig. 222 shows the arrangement as it appears when\r\nviewed from above. The train of six prisms can be so arranged that the\r\nray after passing through six of them shall be totally reflected by a\r\nsurface of the last prism, and pursue again its path through the six\r\nprisms in the reverse direction, becoming more and more dispersed by\r\neach prism until it emerges parallel to the axis of the telescope. The\r\npower of the instrument is, therefore, equivalent to that of one with\r\ntwelve prisms; but it can be used at pleasure with any dispersive power,\r\nfrom two to twelve prisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 222.—_Browning’s Automatic Adjustment of Prisms._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy making use of one of the Bunsen burners, the lines which are\r\ncharacteristic of some ten or twelve metals are readily seen when one of\r\ntheir more volatile salts is converted into vapour. For this purpose\r\ntheir chlorides are usually employed, but the reactions are common to\r\nall their salts. It is necessary that the metal should exist in the\r\nflame in the state of highly heated vapour or gas, in order that its\r\ncharacteristic rays should be given off. We usually introduce compounds\r\nof these metals into the flame; but there is reason to believe that\r\nthese are decomposed in the flame, and the disassociated metal takes the\r\nform of glowing gas, a small quantity of which suffices for the\r\nproduction of the bright lines. No doubt the other constituent of the\r\ncompound, the chlorine for example, is also set free in the gaseous\r\nform; but since the spectrum of the metal only is visible, we may infer\r\nthat at the temperature of the flame, the non-metallic elements are not\r\nsufficiently luminous to produce a spectrum. When we repeat the\r\nexperiments with salts of the less volatile metals, we obtain no\r\nspectra—the temperature of the flame not being sufficiently high to\r\nconvert these into vapour. Other methods have, therefore, to be resorted\r\nto, and advantage is taken of the fact discovered by Faraday, that an\r\nelectric spark is nothing but highly heated matter. The spectroscope\r\ngives us reason to believe that this matter, which is formed of the\r\nsubstances between which the spark passes, is in the gaseous state; for\r\nit is found, on examining sparks passing between two pieces of each\r\nmetal, that characteristic bright lines are produced. If one of the\r\nmetals already named is submitted to this examination, the same lines\r\nare found which are seen in the spectra produced by the salts of the\r\nmetal volatized in the flame, but in some cases additional bright lines\r\nappear in the spark spectrum. With the heavier metals the spark, or the\r\nelectric arc, is, however, the only means of igniting their vapours. The\r\nusual mode of doing this is to make the discharges of a large induction\r\ncoil pass between the two fine wires of the metals, placed about a\r\nquarter of an inch apart. A Leyden jar is commonly employed to condense\r\nthe discharge, and thus produce a still higher temperature. Mr. Browning\r\nhas contrived the neat little apparatus shown in Fig. 223, in which the\r\njar is superseded by a more compact and convenient condenser inside of\r\nthe box, so that it is only necessary to attach one terminal of the coil\r\nto the binding-screw, seen outside of the end of the box, and place the\r\nother wire from the coil in the binding-screw of one or the other of the\r\npieces of apparatus supported by the upright rod. Of these it is the one\r\non the right which at present engages our attention. Within a small\r\nglass cylinder are two sliding rods, terminated by screw-clips, which\r\nhold finely-pointed pieces of the metal under examination. The slit of\r\nthe spectroscope is placed close to the glass cylinder, and when a very\r\nrapid succession of sparks is passing, the bright lines are seen\r\ncontinuously. The spectra of metals examined in this way are found to\r\nyield a very large number of lines. Thus the spectrum of calcium has 75\r\nlines, and that of iron no fewer than 450 lines. Our limits will not\r\npermit of an account of many interesting particulars relating to these\r\nspectra, which include those of all the 50 metallic elements. It should,\r\nperhaps, be stated that a modified mode of producing spectra by sparks\r\nis sometimes found useful. This consists in causing sparks to pass\r\nbetween a solution of some salt of the metal and a piece of platinum\r\nwire. The apparatus for this purpose is that shown on the left side of\r\nthe upright in Fig. 223.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 223.—_Apparatus for Spark Spectra._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt remains to describe the method of producing spectra of the gaseous\r\nnon-metallic elements, such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, &c. For this\r\npurpose electricity is again made use of. It has been found that while\r\nan electric discharge cannot take place across a perfect vacuum, and air\r\nor gas, at ordinary densities, offers much resistance to the passage of\r\nelectricity, on the other hand, a highly rarefied gas permits the\r\ndischarge to take place through it with great facility. This is seen in\r\nGeissler’s tubes, where a succession of discharges from a Ruhmkorff’s\r\ncoil causes the tubes to appear filled with light—due to the heating to\r\nincandescence of a very minute quantity of the gas. The eye readily\r\nrecognizes difference of colour in the light given off by the different\r\ngases, and when this light is examined by the spectroscope, bright\r\nlines, characteristic of each gas, are observed. Nos. 12 and 13, in\r\nPlate XVII., are the spectra of hydrogen and of nitrogen respectively,\r\nwhich appear when the gases are examined in the manner just described.\r\nIn this manner the spectra of chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen,\r\nsulphur, phosphorus, &c., may be studied. Silicon and some other solid\r\nnon-metallic elements present great difficulties to the spectroscopist,\r\nfor these elements cannot be volatized at any temperature we can\r\ncommand, and the spectra of their elements can only be inferred from\r\nthose of their compounds. But unfortunately the spectra are found to\r\nvary with the nature of the compound, and thus it happens that in the\r\ncase of carbon, for example, no definite spectrum can be assigned to the\r\nelement. The flame of coal-gas, burning in the air, as in the Bunsen\r\nburner, gives the spectrum No. 14; but if this is compared with the\r\nspectrum of the flame of burning _cyanogen_ (a compound of carbon and\r\nnitrogen), the two are found to differ greatly. The cyanogen spectrum\r\nhas the two pale broad bands of violet-blue, the four blue lines, the\r\ntwo green lines, and the brightest of the greenish yellow which are seen\r\nin the coal-gas spectrum. But it has in addition a characteristic series\r\nof violet lines, a series of bright blue, two or three crimson and red\r\nlines, and bands in the orange, and several green lines, none of which\r\noccur in the coal-gas spectrum. These additional lines are not due to\r\nnitrogen, for, with perhaps the exception of some red lines, they do not\r\ncoincide in position with any of the nitrogen lines. The spectrum of\r\nhydrogen, No. 12, should be noticed, as its three lines are very\r\ndistinct, and it will be observed that they exactly coincide in their\r\nposition with the three Fraunhofer lines, C, F, and G, in No. 1.\r\n\r\nThere is another branch of this extensive subject to which we have now\r\nto invite the reader’s attention. The power of certain gases to absorb\r\nor stop certain rays of an otherwise continuous spectrum has already\r\nbeen mentioned; but this property is by no means confined to gases, for\r\ncertain liquids and solids do this in a high degree. There is a\r\nremarkable metallic element, named _didymium_. It is a rare substance,\r\nand its presence cannot with certainty be detected by any ordinary\r\ntests. Its salts, however, form solutions _without colour_, or nearly\r\nso, which have the power of strongly absorbing certain rays. If we hold\r\nbefore the slit of the spectrum a small tube containing a solution of\r\nany one of the salts, and allow the rays from the sun, or from a\r\nluminous gas or candle-flame, to pass through it, we see the spectrum\r\ncrossed by certain well-defined very dark bands. A spectrum of this kind\r\nis called an _absorption spectrum_, and the position, number, width,\r\n&c., of dark bands are found to be as peculiar to each substance as are\r\nthe bright lines in the spectra of the elements. The method of observing\r\nthem when produced by solutions is very simple. The liquid is contained\r\nin a small test-tube, which is placed in front of the slit; or, more\r\nconveniently, the liquid is put into a _wedge-shaped_ vessel, and thus\r\nthe thickness of the stratum of liquid through which the rays pass can\r\neasily be varied, so that the best results may be obtained. The\r\nabsorption spectra are produced by many compound substances. A striking\r\nabsorption spectrum is seen when a solution in alcohol of the green\r\ncolouring matter of leaves (_chlorophyll_) is examined; for several\r\ndistinct bands are seen, one in the red being especially well marked.\r\nMany other coloured bodies exhibit characteristic absorption bands, as,\r\nfor example, permanganate of potash, uranic salts, madder, port wine,\r\nand magenta. The bands are so peculiar for each substance, that if\r\nso-called port wine, for example, owe its colour to colouring matter\r\nother than that of the grape, such as logwood, &c., the adulteration can\r\nbe instantly detected by a glance at the absorption spectrum. As,\r\nhowever, the absorption bands are not, like the bright lines of metals,\r\ndefinite images of the slit, but rather broad portions of the spectra,\r\nit is very desirable in examining such spectra to compare them directly\r\nwith those of known substances, by throwing two spectra into one field,\r\nby means of a side reflecting prism, as already described.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most interesting examples of absorption spectra is\r\nthat of blood. A single drop of blood in a tea-cupful of water will show\r\nits characteristic spectrum when it is properly examined. If the blood\r\nis arterial or oxidized blood, two well-marked dark bands are visible;\r\nbut if venous or deoxidized blood be used, we see, instead of the two\r\ndark bands, a single one in an intermediate position. These differences\r\nhave been proved to be due to oxidization and deoxidization of a\r\nconstituent of the blood, called _hæmoglobin_, and by using appropriate\r\nchemical reagents, the same specimen of blood may be made to exhibit any\r\nnumber of alternations of the two spectra, according as oxidants or\r\nreducing reagents are employed. It would be possible by an examination\r\nof the absorption spectrum of a drop of arterial blood to pronounce that\r\na person had died of suffocation from the fumes of burning charcoal. In\r\nsuch case, the supply of oxygen being cut off, the hæmoglobin of the\r\nwhole of the blood in the system becomes deoxidized.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful delicacy of these spectrum reactions has permitted the\r\nspectroscope to be applied to the microscope with signal success by Mr.\r\nBrowning, working in conjunction with Mr. Sorby, who has devoted great\r\nattention to this subject. The Sorby-Browning instrument is a\r\ndirect-vision spectroscope, with a slit, lens, &c., placed above the\r\neye-piece of the microscope. By receiving the light through a single\r\ndrop of an absorptive liquid placed under the object-glass of the\r\nmicroscope, the characteristic bands are made visible. The\r\nmicro-spectroscope is also a valuable instrument for examining the\r\nabsorption bands which are found in the light reflected from solid\r\nbodies, for the smallest fragment suffices to fill the field of the\r\nmicroscope. Mr. Sorby is able to obtain most unmistakably the dark bands\r\npeculiar to blood from a particle of the matter of a blood-stain\r\nweighing less than 1/1000th part of a grain. It is plain from this that\r\nthe spectroscope must sometimes prove of great service in giving\r\nevidence of crime from traces which would escape all ordinary\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe micro-spectroscope, in its most complete form, is represented in\r\nFig. 224. As may be seen from the figure, the apparatus consists of\r\nseveral parts. The prism is contained in a small tube, which can be\r\nremoved at pleasure; below the prism is an achromatic eye-piece, having\r\nan adjustable slit between the two lenses; the upper lens being\r\nfurnished with a screw motion to focus the slit. A side slit, capable of\r\nadjustment, admits, when required, a second beam of light from any\r\nobject whose spectrum it is desired to compare with that of the object\r\nplaced on the stage of the microscope. This second beam of light strikes\r\nagainst a very small prism suitably placed inside the apparatus, and is\r\nreflected up through the compound prism, forming a spectrum in the same\r\nfield with that obtained from the object on the stage. A is a brass tube\r\ncarrying the compound direct-vision prism, and has a sliding arrangement\r\nfor roughly focussing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 224.—_The Sorby-Browning Micro-Spectroscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nB, a milled head, with screw motion to finely adjust the focus of the\r\nachromatic eye-lens.\r\n\r\nC, milled head, with screw motion to open or shut the slit _vertically_.\r\nAnother screw, H, at right angles to C, regulates the slit horizontally.\r\nThis screw has a larger head, and when once recognized cannot be\r\nmistaken for the other.\r\n\r\nD D, an apparatus for holding a small tube, that the spectrum given by\r\nits contents may be compared with that from any other object on the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nE, a screw, opening and shutting a slit to admit the quantity of light\r\nrequired to form the second spectrum. Light entering the aperture near E\r\nstrikes against the right-angled prism which we have mentioned as being\r\nplaced inside the apparatus, and is reflected up through the slit\r\nbelonging to the compound prism. If any incandescent object is placed in\r\na suitable position with reference to the aperture, its spectrum will be\r\nobtained, and will be seen on looking through it.\r\n\r\nF shows the position of the field lens of the eye-piece.\r\n\r\nG is a tube made to fit the microscope to which the instrument is\r\napplied. To use this instrument, insert G like an eye-piece in the\r\nmicroscope tube. Screw on to the microscope the object-glass required,\r\nand place the object whose spectrum is to be viewed on the stage.\r\nIlluminate with stage mirror if transparent, with mirror and lieberkühn\r\nand dark well if opaque, or by side reflector, bull’s-eye, &c. Remove A,\r\nand open the slit by means of the milled head, H, at right angles to D\r\nD. When the slit is sufficiently open the rest of the apparatus acts\r\nlike an ordinary eye-piece, and any object can be focussed in the usual\r\nway. Having focussed the object, replace A, and gradually close the slit\r\ntill a good spectrum is obtained. The spectrum will be much improved by\r\nthrowing the object a little out of focus.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the spectrum differs a little from adjacent parts in\r\nrefrangibility, and delicate bands or lines can only be brought out by\r\naccurately focussing their own parts of the spectrum. This can be done\r\nby the milled head, B. Disappointment will occur in any attempt at\r\ndelicate investigation if this direction is not _carefully attended to_.\r\nWhen the spectra of very small objects are to be viewed, powers of from\r\n½ in. to 1/20th, or higher, may be employed. Blood, madder, aniline\r\ndyes, permanganate of potash solution, are convenient substances to\r\nbegin experiments with. Solutions that are too strong are apt to give\r\ndark clouds instead of delicate absorption bands. Small cells or tubes\r\nshould be used to hold fluids for examination.\r\n\r\nMr. Browning has still further improved the micro-spectroscope by the\r\ningenious arrangement for measuring the positions of the lines, which is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 225, and the construction and the use of which he\r\nthus described in a paper read before the Microscopical Society:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 225.—_Section of Micro-Spectroscope with Micrometer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAttached to the side is a small tube, A A. At the outer part of this\r\ntube is a blackened glass plate, with a fine clear white pointer in the\r\ncentre of the tube. The lens, C, which is focussed by sliding the milled\r\nring, M, produces an image of the bright pointer in the field of view by\r\nreflection from the surface of the prism nearest the eye. On turning the\r\nmicrometer, M, the slide which holds the glass plate is made to travel\r\nin grooves, and the fine pointer is made to traverse the whole length of\r\nthe spectrum.\r\n\r\nIt might at first sight appear as if any ordinary spider’s web or\r\nparallel wire micrometer might be used instead of this contrivance. But\r\non closer attention it will be seen that as the spectrum will not permit\r\nof magnification by the use of lenses, the line of such an ordinary\r\nmicrometer could not be brought to focus and rendered visible. The\r\nbright pointer of the new arrangement possesses this great\r\nadvantage—that it does not illuminate the whole field of view.\r\n\r\nIf a dark wire were used, the bright diffused light would almost obscure\r\nthe faint light of the spectra, and entirely prevent the possibility of\r\nseeing, let alone measuring, the position of lines or bands in the most\r\nrefrangible part of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nTo produce good effects with this apparatus the upper surface of the\r\ncompound prism, P, must make an angle of exactly 45° with the sides of\r\nthe tube. Under these circumstances the limits of correction for the\r\npath of the rays in their passage through the dispersing prisms are very\r\nlimited and must be strictly observed. The usual method of correcting by\r\nthe outer surface is inadmissible. For the sake of simplicity, some of\r\nthe work of the lower part of the micro-spectroscope is omitted in the\r\nengraving. As to the method of using this contrivance: With the\r\napparatus just described, measure the position of the principal\r\nFraunhofer’s lines in the solar spectrum. Let this be done _carefully_,\r\nin _bright_ daylight. A little time given to this measurement will not\r\nbe thrown away, as it will not require to be done again. Note down the\r\nnumbers corresponding to the position of the lines, and draw a spectrum\r\nfrom a scale of equal parts. About 3 in. will be found long enough for\r\nthis spectrum; but it may be made as much longer as is thought\r\ndesirable, as the measurements will not depend in any way on the\r\ndistance of these lines apart, but only on the micrometric numbers\r\nattached to them. Let this scale be done on cardboard and preserved for\r\nreference. Now measure the position of the dark bands in any absorption\r\nspectra, taking care for this purpose to use lamplight, as daylight will\r\ngive, of course, the Fraunhofer lines, which will tend to confuse your\r\nspectrum. If the few lines occurring in most absorption spectra be now\r\ndrawn to the same scale as the solar spectrum, on placing the scales\r\nside by side, a glance will show the exact position of the bands in the\r\nspectrum relatively to the Fraunhofer lines, which thus treated form a\r\nnatural and unchangeable scale (see diagram, Fig. 226). But for purposes\r\nof comparison it will be found sufficient to compare the two lists of\r\nnumbers representing the micrometric measures, simply exchanging copies\r\nof the scale of Fraunhofer lines, or the numbers representing them will\r\nenable observers at a distance from each other to compare their results,\r\nor even to work simultaneously on the same subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 226.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA simpler form of the micro-spectroscope is also made by Mr. Browning at\r\na very modest price, and if the reader possesses a microscope, and\r\ndesires to examine these interesting subjects for himself, he will do\r\nwell to procure this instrument, instead of that represented in Fig.\r\n220, as it will also answer better for other purposes. A section of the\r\ninstrument is shown in Fig. 227. When used with the microscope it is\r\nslipped into the place of the eye-piece. There is an adjustable slit, a\r\nreflecting prism, by which two different spectra may be examined at\r\nonce, and a train of five prisms for dispersing the rays. It can be used\r\nequally well for seeing the bright lines of metals and the Fraunhofer\r\nlines, and for viewing any two spectra simultaneously. These\r\ndirect-vision spectroscopes are better adapted for general use by those\r\nwho have not several different instruments, than such forms as that\r\nshown in Fig. 229, for in the direct-vision instruments the whole extent\r\nof the spectrum is visible at one view, which is by no means the case\r\nwith the larger instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 227.—_Section of Micro-Spectroscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _CELESTIAL CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS._\r\n\r\nWe now approach that portion of our subject in which its interest\r\nculminates, for however remarkable may be some of the above-named\r\nresults of this searching optical analysis, they are surpassed by those\r\nwhich have been obtained in the field upon which we are about to enter.\r\nThe cause of the dark lines which Fraunhofer observed in the light of\r\nthe sun and of certain stars remained unexplained, he only establishing\r\nthe fact that they must be due to some absorptive power existing in the\r\nsun and stars themselves, and not to anything in our atmosphere. It was\r\nreserved for Professor Kirchhoff, of the University of Heidelberg, to\r\nshow the full significance of the dark lines. Fraunhofer had, on his\r\nfirst observation of the lines, noticed that the D lines were coincident\r\nwith the bright lines in the spectrum of sodium. This interesting fact\r\nmay be readily observed with any spectroscope which permits of the two\r\nspectra being simultaneously viewed. The bright line (or lines if the\r\nspectroscope be powerful) of the metal is seen as a prolongation of the\r\ndark D solar line. Even with an instrument like that shown in Fig. 220\r\nthe coincidence may be noticed. Let the observer receive into the\r\ninstrument the rays in diffused daylight only, when he will still see\r\nthe principal Fraunhofer lines distinctly, and let him note the exact\r\nposition of the D line, while he brings in front of the slit the flame\r\nof a spirit-lamp charged with a little salt. He will then see the bright\r\nyellow line replacing the dark D line, and by alternately removing and\r\nputting back the lamp he will be soon convinced of the perfectly\r\nidentical position of the lines.\r\n\r\nThis fact remained without explanation from 1814 to 1859, when Kirchhoff\r\naccidentally found, to his surprise, that the dark D line could be\r\nproduced artificially. He says: “In order to test in the most direct\r\nmanner possible the frequently asserted fact of the coincidence of the\r\nsodium lines with the D lines, I obtained a tolerably bright solar\r\nspectrum, and brought a flame coloured by sodium vapour in front of the\r\nslit. I then saw the dark lines D, change into bright ones. The flame of\r\na Bunsen’s lamp threw the bright sodium lines upon the solar spectrum\r\nwith unexpected brilliancy. In order to find out the extent to which the\r\nintensity of the solar spectrum could be increased without impairing the\r\ndistinctness of the sodium lines, I allowed the full sunlight to shine\r\nthrough the sodium flame, and, to my astonishment, I saw that the _dark\r\nlines_, D, _appeared with an extraordinary_ degree of clearness. I then\r\nexchanged the sunlight for the Drummond’s or oxy-hydrogen lime-light,\r\nwhich, like that of all incandescent solid or liquid bodies, gives a\r\nspectrum containing no dark lines. When this light was allowed to fall\r\nthrough a suitable flame, coloured by common salt, _dark_ lines were\r\nseen in the spectrum in the position of the sodium lines. The same\r\nphenomenon was observed if, instead of the incandescent lime, a platinum\r\nwire was used, which, being heated in the flame, was brought to a\r\ntemperature near its melting point, by passing an electric current\r\nthrough it. The phenomenon in question is easily explained, upon the\r\nsupposition that the sodium flame absorbs rays of the same degree of\r\nrefrangibility as those it emits, whilst it is perfectly transparent for\r\nall other rays.” (Quoted in Roscoe’s Lectures on “Spectrum Analysis.”)\r\nWhen the light of ignited lime was similarly made to pass through flames\r\ncontaining the incandescent vapours of potassium, barium, strontium,\r\n&c., the bright lines which these substances would have produced had the\r\nlime-light not been present were found to be in every case changed into\r\ndark lines, occupying the very same positions in the spectrum. In such\r\nexperiments the flames containing the metals in the vapourized state do\r\nall the time really give off those rays which are peculiar to each\r\nsubstance; but when a more intense illumination—such as the lime-light,\r\nthe electric arc, or direct sunlight—passes through them, the rays of\r\nthe spectrum produced by the intense light overpower those given off by\r\nthe relatively feebly coloured flames, and hence the portions of the\r\nspectrum which are occupied by these, appear black. But as the intense\r\nlight would give a perfectly continuous spectrum if the incandescent\r\nmetallic vapour allowed the rays corresponding to its lines to pass\r\nthrough it, the inference is obvious that each vapour absorbs those\r\nparticular rays which it has itself the power of emitting, but allows\r\nall others to pass freely through it. Besides the experimental proofs of\r\nthis fact which have been already adduced, many others might be named.\r\nThe flame of a spirit-lamp with a salted wick appears opaque and smoky\r\nwhen we look through it at a large flame of burning hydrogen, also\r\ncoloured by sodium; for the rays emitted by the latter do not penetrate\r\nthe former, which, in consequence of its feebler light, appears dark by\r\ncomparison. Again, if an exhausted tube containing metallic sodium be\r\nheated so as to convert the sodium into vapour, the tube viewed by the\r\nlight of a sodium flame appear to contain a black smoke, and the light\r\nfrom the flame will no more pass through it than through a solid object;\r\nyet the tube appears perfectly transparent when viewed by ordinary\r\nlight, and the light from a lithium or other coloured flame would also\r\npass freely. Kirchhoff was led by purely theoretical reasoning to\r\nconclude that all luminous bodies have precisely the same power of\r\nabsorbing certain rays of light as they have of emitting them at the\r\nsame temperature, and he thus brought luminous rays under the same\r\ngeneral law which had previously been established for radiant heat by\r\nPrevost, Dessains, Balfour Stewart, and others. Here, then, a law was\r\narrived at, and, abundantly confirmed by direct experiment as regards\r\nthe more volatile metals, it was ready to supply the most satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the coincidences which were everywhere discovered to\r\nexist between the Fraunhofer lines and those which belong to terrestrial\r\nsubstances. For Kirchhoff also found, when mapping the very numerous\r\nlines seen in the spark spectrum of iron, that for each of the 90 bright\r\nlines of iron which he then observed, there was a dark line in the solar\r\nspectrum exactly corresponding in position. The number of observed\r\nbright lines in the iron spectrum has been since extended to 460, and\r\nyet each is found to have its exact counterpart in a solar dark line.\r\n\r\nSo many coincidences as these made it certain that these dark lines and\r\nthe bright lines of iron must have a common cause, for the chances\r\nagainst the supposition that the agreement was merely accidental are\r\nenormous. Kirchhoff actually calculated, by the theory of probabilities,\r\nthe odds against the supposition. He found it represented by\r\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000 to 1. The result arrived at in the case of\r\nsodium at once suggested the explanation that these lines were produced\r\nby an absorptive effect of the vapour of iron. Now, the existence of\r\nsuch a vapour in our atmosphere could not be admitted, while the\r\ntemperature of the sun was known to be exceedingly high, far higher,\r\nindeed, than any temperature we can produce by electricity, or any other\r\nmeans. Hence, Kirchhoff concluded that his observations proved the\r\npresence of the vapour of iron in the sun’s atmosphere with as much\r\ncertainty as if the iron had been actually submitted to chemical tests.\r\nBy the same reasoning, Kirchhoff also demonstrated the existence in the\r\nsolar atmosphere of calcium, chromium, magnesium, nickel, barium,\r\ncopper, and zinc. To these, other observers have added strontium,\r\ncadmium, cobalt, manganese, lead, potassium, aluminium, titanium,\r\nuranium, and hydrogen. It has also been demonstrated that a considerable\r\nnumber of the Fraunhofer lines are due to absorption in our atmosphere\r\nby its gases and aqueous vapour. This demonstration of the existence of\r\niron and nickel in the sun is an interesting pendent to the known\r\ncomposition of many meteorites which reach us from interplanetary space.\r\n\r\nKirchhoff was led to believe that the central part of the sun is formed\r\nof an incandescent solid or liquid, giving out rays of all\r\nrefrangibility, just as white-hot carbon does; that round this there is\r\nan immense atmosphere, in which sodium, iron, aluminium, &c., exist in\r\nthe state of gas, where they have the power of absorbing certain rays;\r\nthat the solar atmosphere extends far beyond the sun, and forms the\r\ncorona; and that the dark sunspots, which astronomers have supposed to\r\nbe cavities, are a kind of cloud, floating in the vaporous atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDuring total eclipses of the sun, certain red-coloured prominences have\r\nbeen noticed projecting from the sun’s limb, and visible only when the\r\nglare of its disc is entirely intercepted by the moon. Fig. 228\r\nrepresents a total eclipse, and will give a rude notion of the\r\nappearance of the red prominences seen against the fainter light of the\r\n_corona_, which extends to a considerable distance beyond the sun’s\r\ndisc. Now, two distinguished men of science simultaneously and\r\nindependently made the discovery of a mode of seeing these red\r\nprominences, even when the sun was unobscured. M. Janssen was observing\r\na total eclipse of the sun in India, and the examination by the\r\nspectroscope of the light emitted from the red prominences showed him\r\nthat they were due to immense columns of incandescent hydrogen, for he\r\nrecognised the red line and blue lines which belong to the spectrum of\r\nthis gas (see No. 12, Plate XVII.). Mr. Norman Lockyer at the same time\r\nalso succeeded in viewing the solar prominences in London without an\r\neclipse. He found a red line perfectly coinciding in position with\r\nFraunhofer’s C line and that of hydrogen, another nearly coinciding with\r\nF, and a third yellow line near D. Soon after this, Dr. Huggins\r\ndiscovered a mode of observing the shape of the red prominences at any\r\ntime, by using a powerful train of prisms and a wide slit, so that the\r\nchanges in the forms of the red flames can be followed. Now, since the\r\nred prominences give off only a few rays of particular refrangibility,\r\nit is not difficult to understand that the light of the sun might be, as\r\nit were, so diluted by stretching out the spectrum, by means of a train\r\nof many prisms, that almost only the red rays, C, should enter the\r\ntelescope, and occupy the field with sufficient intensity to overpower\r\nall others, and produce an image of the object from which they\r\noriginated. The nature of this action may be illustrated thus: If we\r\nhold vertically a prism, and look through it at a candle-flame, we may\r\nperceive a lengthened-out image of the flame, showing the succession of\r\nprismatic colours, and formed, as it were, of a red image of the flame\r\nclose to a yellow one, and so on, but presenting no defined form. If,\r\nstill viewing this spectrum, we introduce into the flame on a platinum\r\nwire a piece of common salt, we shall perceive a well-defined yellow\r\nimage of the candle start out, because the rays which are emitted by the\r\nincandescent sodium, being all of one refrangibility, the prism simply\r\nrefracts without dispersing them. The dispersion which weakens the light\r\nof the continuous spectrum by lengthening it out, does not sensibly\r\ndetract from the brilliancy of the bright lines, as their breadth is\r\nscarcely increased—they are refracted but not dispersed. Hence, when a\r\nsufficient number of prisms is employed, the bright lines of the solar\r\n_chromosphere_ may be seen in full sunshine, in spite of the greater\r\nintensity of the light emanating from the _photosphere_, which produces\r\nthe continuous spectrum. The bright C line is, of course, a virtual\r\nimage of the slit produced by rays of that particular refrangibility;\r\nbut by using a very high dispersive power, the slit may be opened so\r\nwide that the C rays form in the telescope a red image of the prominence\r\nfrom which they issue, since their light will predominate over that of\r\nany rays belonging to the continuous spectrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 228.—_Solar Eclipse, 1869._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the hands of Mr. Norman Lockyer the science of the physical and\r\nchemical constitution of the sun has made rapid progress, and new facts\r\nare continually being observed, which serve to furnish more and more\r\ndefinite views. Mr. Lockyer considers that, extending to a great\r\ndistance around the sun is an atmosphere of comparatively cooler\r\nhydrogen, or perhaps of some still lighter substance which is unknown to\r\nus. It is this which forms what is termed the _corona_, or circle of\r\nlight which is seen surrounding the sun in a total eclipse. Immersed in\r\nthis, and extending to a much smaller distance from the nucleus of the\r\nsun, is another envelope, termed the _chromosphere_, consisting of\r\nincandescent hydrogen and some glowing vapours of magnesium and calcium.\r\nThe brightest part of this envelope, which lies nearest the sun, is that\r\nwhich gives off the red rays by which the prominences may be observed\r\nwithout an eclipse. These prominences have been shown to be tremendous\r\noutbursts of glowing hydrogen, belched up with sometimes an enormous\r\nvelocity from below, since they have been observed to spring up 90,000\r\nmiles in a few minutes. Beneath the chromosphere, and nearer to the body\r\nof the sun, are enormous quantities of the vapours of the different\r\nelements—sodium, iron, &c.—to which the dark lines of the solar spectrum\r\nare due. This stratum Mr. Lockyer calls the _reversing layer_, because\r\nit reverses (turns to dark) the lines which would otherwise have\r\nappeared bright, just as Kirchhoff’s sodium vapour did in the experiment\r\ndescribed on page 437. Beneath the reversing layer is the _photosphere_,\r\nfrom which emanates the light that is absorbed in part by the reversing\r\nlayer, and which there is good reason to believe is either intensely\r\nheated solid or liquid matter.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Dr. Huggins devoted himself, with an ardour which has since\r\nknown no remission, to the extension of prismatic analysis to the other\r\nheavenly bodies. The difficulties of the investigations were great.\r\nThere was first the small quantity of light which a star sends to the\r\nspectator; this was obviated by the use of a telescope of large\r\naperture, which admitted and brought to a focus many more rays from the\r\nstar, and therefore the brightness of the image was proportionately\r\nincreased. Not so the size of the image: the case of the fixed stars for\r\nthis always remains a mere point. It was, of course, necessary to drive\r\nthe telescope by clockwork, so that the light of the star might be\r\nstationary on the field of the spectroscope. As the spectrum of the\r\nimage of the star formed by the object-glass would be a mere line,\r\nwithout sufficient breadth for an observation of the dark or light lines\r\nby which it might be crossed, it is necessary to spread out the image so\r\nthat the whole of the light may be drawn out into a very narrow line,\r\nhaving a length no greater than will produce a spectrum broad enough for\r\nthe eye to distinguish the lines in it. This is accomplished by means of\r\na cylindrical lens placed in the focus of the object-glass, and\r\nimmediately in front of the slit. Covering one-half of the slit is a\r\nright-angled prism by which the light to be compared with that of the\r\nstar is reflected into the slit. The light is usually that produced by\r\ntaking electric sparks between wires of the metal in the manner already\r\ndescribed. The dispersive power of the spectroscope was furnished by two\r\nprisms of very dense glass, and the spectrum was viewed through a\r\ntelescope of short focal length. Dr. Huggins’s observations lead him to\r\nthe conclusion that the planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn possess\r\natmospheres, as does also the beautiful ring by which Saturn is\r\nsurrounded; for he noticed in the spectrum of each different dark lines\r\nnot belonging to the solar spectrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 229.—_The Planet Saturn._\r\n]\r\n\r\nPassing to the results obtained in the case of the fixed stars, we may\r\nremind the reader of the enormous distance of the bodies which are\r\nsubmitted to the new method of analysis. Sir John Herschel gives the\r\nfollowing illustration of the remoteness of Sirius—supposed to be one of\r\nthe nearest of the fixed stars: Take a globe, 2 ft. in diameter, to\r\nrepresent the sun, and at a distance of 215 ft. place a pea, to give the\r\nproportionate size and distance of the earth. If you wish to represent\r\nthe distance of Sirius _on the same scale_, you must suppose something\r\nplaced _forty thousand miles_ away from the little models of sun and\r\nearth. But not only do we know with certainty some of the substances\r\ncontained in Sirius, but the star spectroscope has taught us a great\r\ndeal about orbs so remote, that their distance is absolutely\r\nunmeasurable. About Aldebaran we know that there are hydrogen gas and\r\nvapours of magnesium, iron, calcium, sodium, and some four or five other\r\nelements. Generally the lines indicate the presence of hydrogen in these\r\ndistant suns; but there is, at least, one remarkable exception in α\r\n_Orionis_, the spectrum of which yields no trace of the hydrogen lines,\r\nalthough it is evident that magnesium, sodium, calcium, &c., are\r\npresent. The spectra of celestial bodies are of several kinds. Many of\r\nthe stars have, like our sun, a continuous spectrum crossed by dark\r\nlines. Such is that of Sirius, No. 10, Plate XVII. Others have, however,\r\nboth dark and bright lines, and some are marked by only three bright\r\nspaces. Of the spectra of the nebulæ some have three bright lines (see\r\nNo. 11, Plate XVII.), and the bodies producing them are, therefore, to\r\nbe considered as masses of incandescent gas, while some give continuous\r\nspectra. One of the bright lines in the spectra of the nebulæ coincides\r\nwith one of the hydrogen lines, and another—the brightest of the\r\nthree—with one of the brightest nitrogen lines; but the third does not\r\nagree with any with which it has as yet been compared. The inference\r\nfrom these appearances is that the nebulæ contain hydrogen and nitrogen,\r\nbut the absence of the other lines of these substances has not been\r\nfully explained; although the observation of Dr. Huggins, that when the\r\nlight of incandescent nitrogen and hydrogen is gradually obscured by\r\ninterposing layers of neutral tinted glass, the lines corresponding with\r\nthose in the nebular spectra are the last to disappear, seems to suggest\r\na probable solution of the difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 230.—_Solar Prominences, No. 1._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere is another very interesting line of spectroscopic research in the\r\npower the prism gives us of estimating the velocity with which the\r\ndistances of the stars from our system are increasing or diminishing. On\r\nclosely examining the hydrogen lines of Sirius, and comparing them with\r\nthe bright lines of hydrogen rendered incandescent by electric\r\ndischarges in a Geissler tube, the spectrum of which his instrument\r\nenabled him to place side by side with that of the star, Mr. Huggins was\r\nsurprised to find that the lines in the latter did not exactly coincide\r\nin position with those of the former, but appeared slightly nearer the\r\nred end of the spectrum. This indicated a longer wave-length, or\r\nincreased period of vibration, according to the theory of light, which\r\nwould be accounted for by a receding motion between Sirius and the\r\nearth, just as the crest of successive waves of the sea would overtake a\r\nboat going in the same direction at longer intervals of time than those\r\nat which they would pass a fixed point, while, if the boat were meeting\r\nthe waves, these intervals would, on the other hand, be shorter. Hence\r\nif the position of the lines in the spectrum depends on the periods of\r\nvibration, that position will be shifted towards the red end when the\r\nluminous body is receding from the earth with a velocity comparable to\r\nthat of light, and towards the violet end when the motion is one of\r\napproach. The change in refrangibility observed by Mr. Huggins\r\ncorresponded with a receding velocity of 41·4 miles per second, and when\r\nfrom this was subtracted the known speed with which the earth’s motion\r\nround the sun was carrying us from the star at the time, the remainder\r\nexpressed a motion of recession amounting to about twenty miles a\r\nsecond, which motion, there is reason to believe, is chiefly due to a\r\nproper movement of Sirius. These deductions from prismatic observations\r\nare of the highest value astronomically, since they will eventually\r\nenable the real motions of the stars to be determined, for ordinary\r\nobservation could only show us that component of the motion which is at\r\nright angles to the visual ray, while this gives the component along the\r\nvisual ray. In the same manner, it is inferred that Arcturus, a bright\r\nstar in the constellation _Boötes_, is approaching us with a velocity of\r\nfifty-five miles per second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 231.—_Solar Prominences, No. 2._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the solar spots are examined with the spectroscope, the dark image\r\nof the slit produced by the hydrogen line, F, is observed to show a\r\nstrange crookedness when it is formed by rays from different parts of\r\nthe spot. This distortion is due to the same cause as the displacement\r\nof the stellar lines, namely, motions of approach or recession of the\r\nmasses of glowing hydrogen. Mr. Norman Lockyer, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor the most elaborate investigations of the solar surface, has\r\ncalculated, from the position of the lines, the velocities with which\r\nmasses of heated hydrogen are seen bursting upwards, and those which\r\nbelong to the down-rushes of cooler gas. Velocities as great as 100\r\nmiles per second were, in this way, inferred to occur in some of the\r\nstorms which agitate the solar surface. Two drawings of a solar storm,\r\ngiven by Mr. Lockyer, are shown in Figs. 230 and 231. These are\r\nrepresentations of one of the so-called red prominences, the first\r\ngiving its appearance at five minutes past eleven on the morning of\r\nMarch 14th, 1869, and the last showing the same _ten minutes\r\nafterwards_. The enormous velocity which these rapid changes imply will\r\nbe understood when it is stated that this prominence was 27,000 miles\r\nhigh. “This will give you some idea,” says Mr. Lockyer, “of the\r\nindications which the spectroscope reveals to us, of the enormous forces\r\nat work in the sun, merely as representing the stars, for everything we\r\nhave to say about the sun the prism tells us—and it was the first to\r\ntell us—we must assume to be said about the stars. I have little doubt\r\nthat, as time rolls on, the spectroscope will become, in fact, almost\r\nthe pocket companion of every one amongst us; and it is utterly\r\nimpossible to foresee what depths of space will not in time be gauged\r\nand completely investigated by this new method of research.”\r\n\r\nThe light of comets has also been examined by the spectroscope, and many\r\ninteresting results arrived at. Our limits do not, however, permit us to\r\nenter into a discussion of these interesting subjects.\r\n\r\nFig. 232 is a section of another of Mr. Browning’s popular instruments,\r\nwhich is named by him the “Amateur’s Star Spectroscope.” It exhibits\r\nvery distinctly the different spectra of the various stars, nebulæ,\r\ncomets, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 232.—_Section of Amateur’s Star Spectroscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe reader who is desirous of learning more of this fascinating subject\r\nis referred to Dr. Roscoe’s elegant volume, entitled, “Lectures on\r\nSpectrum Analysis.” This work, which is embellished with handsome\r\nengravings and illustrated by coloured maps and spectra, gives a clear\r\nand full account of every department of the subject, and in the form of\r\nappendices, abstracts of the more important original papers are\r\nsupplied, while a complete list is given of all the memoirs and\r\npublications relating to the spectroscope which have been published.\r\n\r\nThis brief account of the spectroscope and its revelations, which is all\r\nthat our space permits us to give, will not fail to awaken new thoughts\r\nin the mind of a reader who has obtained even a glimpse of the nature of\r\nthe subject, especially in relation to that branch of which we have last\r\ntreated, for in every age and in every region the stars have attracted\r\nthe gaze and excited the imagination of men. The belief in their\r\ninfluence over human affairs was profound, universal, and enduring; for\r\nit survived the dawn of rising science, being among the last shades of\r\nthe long night of superstition which melted away in the morning of true\r\nknowledge. Even Francis Bacon, the father of the inductive philosophy,\r\nand old Sir Thomas Browne, the exposer of “Vulgar Errors,” believed in\r\nthe influences of the stars; for while recognizing the impostures\r\npractised by its professors, they still regarded astrology as a science\r\nnot altogether vain. It was reserved for the mighty genius of Newton to\r\nprove that in very truth there are invisible ties connecting our earth\r\nwith those remote and brilliant bodies—ties more potent than ever\r\nastrology divined; for he showed that even the most distant orb is bound\r\nto its companions and to our planet by the same power that draws the\r\nprojected stone to the ground. And now the spectroscope is revealing\r\nother lines of connection, and showing that not gravitation alone is the\r\nsympathetic bond which unites our globe to the celestial orbs, but that\r\nthere exists the closer tie of a common constitution, for they are all\r\nmade of the same matter, obeying the same physical and chemical laws\r\nwhich belong to it on the earth. We learn that hydrogen, and magnesium,\r\nand iron, and other familiar substances, exist in these inconceivably\r\ndistant suns, and there exhibit the identical properties which\r\ncharacterize them here. We confirm, by the spectroscope, the fact\r\npartially revealed by other lines of research, that the stars which\r\nappear so fixed, are, in reality, careering through space, each with its\r\nproper motion. We learn also that the stars are the theatres of vast\r\nchemical and physical changes and transformations, the rapidity and\r\nextent of which we can hardly conceive. There is, for example, the case\r\nof that wonderful star in the constellation of the Crown, which, in\r\n1866, suddenly blazed out, from a scarcely discernible telescopic star,\r\nto become one of the most conspicuous in the heavens, and the bright\r\nlines its beams produced in the spectroscope revealed the fact that this\r\nabrupt splendour was due to masses—who can imagine how vast?—of\r\nincandescent hydrogen. This brightness soon waned, and τ _Coronæ\r\nBorealis_ reverted once more to all but telescopic invisibility. The\r\nseeming fixity of the stars is an illusion of the same nature as that\r\nwhich prevents a casual observer from recognizing their apparent diurnal\r\nmotion, and now we have also ample evidence that permanence of physical\r\ncondition, even in the stars, is impossible. Everywhere in the universe\r\nthere is motion and change; there is no pause, no rest, but a continual\r\nunfolding, an endless progression.\r\n\r\n                       “Know the stars yonder,\r\n                       The stars everlasting,\r\n                       Are fugitive also,\r\n                       And emulate, vaulted,\r\n                       The lambent heat-lightning\r\n                       And fire-fly’s flight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ROENTGEN’S X RAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 232_a_.—_Living Hand. Exposure, 4 Minutes._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn page 507 reference will be made to certain remarkable effects\r\nobserved by Mr. Crookes when the electric discharges from an induction\r\ncoil are passed through very highly exhausted tubes. These\r\nphosphorescent and mechanical effects Mr. Crookes attributed to streams\r\nof “radiant matter” shot off from the _negative_ pole with immense\r\nvelocities—the matter not being that of the electrode itself, but\r\nparticles of the extremely rarefied residual gas, which, being\r\ncomparatively few, could mostly traverse the tube in straight lines\r\nwithout coming into collision with their fellows, and thus a class of\r\nphenomena, different from the striated discharges in the ordinary and\r\nless highly exhausted Geissler tubes, comes into view. The emanations\r\nfrom the negative pole, or _cathode_, in highly rarefied gases became\r\nknown as the “cathode rays,” and they began to be further examined by\r\nother observers, and more particularly in 1894 by Hittorf, and by M.\r\nLenard, a Hungarian physicist, who found that they pass through thin\r\nplates of metal, and through wood and other substances not transparent\r\nto ordinary light. It was also observed by Lenard, and also previously\r\nby Hertz, that there are several kinds of cathode rays, which differ\r\nfrom each other as regards their powers of exciting phosphorescence,\r\ncapability of being deflected by a magnet, and the degrees in which they\r\nare absorbed by various media. But universal attention was drawn to this\r\nsubject by the announcement, at the end of 1895, of certain discoveries\r\nmade by Dr. W. K. Roentgen, a professor of physics at Wurzburg. He\r\ncovered a highly-exhausted Crookes’ tube with black cardboard, and found\r\nthat when the discharge of a large induction coil was passed through the\r\ntube in a dark room, a piece of paper coated on one side with\r\nplatino-cyanide of barium, and held near the covered tube, glowed with a\r\nbrilliant fluorescence, no matter which side of the paper was turned\r\ntowards the tube; and even at a distance of two yards some fluorescence\r\nwas still visible. On experimenting with various bodies interposed\r\nbetween the covered tube and the fluorescent screen, it was found that\r\nthe emanations passed through nearly every substance with more or less\r\nfacility. The screen lit up when placed behind a book of a thousand\r\npages, also behind two packs of cards. A single layer of tin-foil\r\nscarcely threw a shadow, and several thicknesses were required to\r\nproduce a distinct effect. Deal boards, an inch thick, offered little\r\nresistance. A very thick plate of aluminium (6/10 inch) reduced the\r\nfluorescence, but still allowed some rays to pass. The hand held before\r\nthe fluorescent screen showed a dark shadow of the bones only, with but\r\na faint outline of their fleshy investment. Copper, silver, gold,\r\nplatinum, and lead, in comparatively small thicknesses, intercept these\r\nrays. Thus a plate of lead only five hundredths of an inch thick almost\r\nstops them. Increase of thickness increases the resistance to their\r\npassage in all cases; but the comparative transparency of a body cannot\r\nbe deduced from its thickness and density. Many other bodies besides\r\nplatino-cyanide of barium become fluorescent under the influence of\r\nthese rays, such as certain kinds of glass, Iceland spar, rock-salt,\r\netc. Dr. Roentgen is convinced that these rays are not the cathode rays\r\nor any part of them; but as the theoretical nature of the new rays has\r\nnot yet been explained, he has preferred to provisionally call them the\r\nX rays, a denomination doubtless suggested by the use of the symbol _x_\r\nin algebra to represent unknown quantities.\r\n\r\nThe source of the X rays, Roentgen states, is at the place where the\r\ncathode rays strike the walls of the exhausted tube, and produce the\r\nmost brilliant phosphorescence; but they cannot be cathode rays which\r\nhave merely passed through the glass, for, contrary to what has been\r\nobserved with respect to the latter, they cannot be deflected by a\r\nmagnet. Nor is glass the only substance in which they can be generated,\r\nfor they were obtained from an apparatus in which the cathode rays were\r\nmade to impinge upon a plate of aluminium nearly one-tenth of an inch\r\nthick. Photographic dry plates are also sensitive to the X rays, and\r\ntheir power to pass through wood, ebonite, etc., makes the experiments\r\nof testing the opacity, or otherwise, of various objects for them quite\r\neasy. It is necessary merely to place the object on the closed cover of\r\nthe dark slide, and place the whole under the vacuum tube; all the\r\nexposure, which is somewhat prolonged in most cases, may be made in\r\nordinary light. But the light-tight boxes, in which photographic plates\r\nare packed, cannot, of course, be brought near the apparatus, as they\r\nare completely permeable to the X rays, and their whole contents may be\r\nrendered useless. The impression obtained on the photographic plate is\r\nnot so much a photograph as a _shadow_ of the interposed object—a shadow\r\nmore or less dense in the positive print according to the permeability\r\nof the object, and the length of the exposure. These photographic\r\nresults have sometimes been called “shadowgrams,” “radiograms,”\r\n“radiographs,” “skiagraphs,” etc. The word _skiagraph_ appears the most\r\nappropriate designation. That the emanations from the phosphorescing\r\nsubstance on which the cathode rays impinge are entitled to be also\r\ncalled rays, appears from the regularity of the shadows thrown on the\r\nfluorescent screen or photographic plate; and the fact of their\r\npropagation in straight lines was proved by Dr. Roentgen obtaining a\r\n_pin-hole_ photograph of the phosphorescing part of the vacuum tube,\r\nwhen the latter was enveloped in black paper. Why a _pin-hole_ and not a\r\nlens was used for taking this photograph will presently appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 232_b_.—_Skiagraph of a Hand, by Dr. Roentgen. The Third Finger\r\n    has a Ring on it._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of Dr. Roentgen’s experiments excited the attention and interest of\r\nthe general public, as well as of the scientific world, in the most\r\nextraordinary degree, and though its announcement was received in some\r\nquarters with incredulity, experimenters in all parts of the world\r\nimmediately set themselves at work to test the truth of the alleged\r\ndiscovery. Electrical apparatus of different kinds, with various\r\nadjustments, were employed, with results that were in some cases\r\nfailures, in others confirmations of the German professor’s statements,\r\nand not unfrequently the variations in the conditions gave rise to\r\nincreased knowledge of the phenomena generally. The experiment just\r\nalluded was one in which a dry photographic plate contained in one of\r\nthe camera dark slides, now so familiar to every one, was placed (with\r\nthe slide still closed by its wooden cover of nearly one quarter of an\r\ninch thick) a few inches below the Crookes’ tube, and the hand of a\r\nliving-person being extended on the outside of the cover, a shadow of\r\nthe bones of the hand, as if seen through the surrounding tissues, was\r\nobtained. Much popular misconception as to the powers of the “new\r\nphotography” arose from want of knowledge of the process by which these\r\nstrange pictures were obtained, the common notion being that these\r\nphotographs were produced by some method of using a camera, and that\r\noutlines of people’s bodies and skeletons could be taken\r\ninstantaneously, not only through their clothes, but through doors and\r\nwalls. Much nearer the mark was the allusion of a scientific writer as\r\nto the possibility of the new process realising Dickens’ description of\r\nMarley’s ghost: “His body was transparent, so that Scrooge, observing\r\nhim, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his\r\ncoat behind.” The value of the new discovery for medical and surgical\r\npurposes was immediately recognised, and very soon its application was\r\nsuccessfully practised.\r\n\r\nDr. Roentgen found that the X rays are incapable of refraction, in this\r\nrespect differing from ordinary light (see pages 397 and following), and\r\namong the experiments which most impressed and astonished his auditors\r\nwhen he was lecturing at Potsdam on his new discovery before the\r\nImperial Court of Germany, was one in which he showed the X rays passing\r\nin a straight line through water without undergoing refraction. The rays\r\npass without interruption equally through the substances, whether these\r\nbe coherent or in a layer of fine powder of the same thickness, and this\r\nagain shows that there can be no regular reflection or refraction.\r\nPrisms and lenses, whether of glass, ebonite, or aluminium, fail to\r\nafford evidence of refractive action, hence the X rays cannot be focused\r\nlike those of ordinary light, and that is why the photograph of the\r\nvacuum tube had to be taken by a pin-hole. Again, glass lenses could not\r\nbe used, because this substance, so transparent to light, is\r\nparticularly opaque to the X rays, and would in a great degree intercept\r\nthem, while lenses of ebonite and of aluminium, which were tried, were\r\ninoperative on account of the irrefrangibility of the rays.\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of the rays themselves, Dr. Roentgen rejects the notion\r\nof their being “ultra-violet” rays, which was suggested by some. The\r\nmeaning of this term is seen when it is understood that a great distance\r\nbeyond the violet end of the visible spectrum there are radiations,\r\nrevealed by their photographic impressions, so that the whole spectrum\r\nis really some eight times as long as the visible part. In consequence\r\nof these ultra-violet rays acting on the photographic plate, it is\r\npossible, as has long been known, to take a photograph in the dark. The\r\neye is quite insensible to the X rays also, and although these, as we\r\nhave seen, readily pass through the bodily tissues, it may be placed\r\nquite near the discharge tube, the latter being enveloped in black\r\npaper, without causing any sensation. That the new rays are in some way\r\nallied to light is the opinion held by Dr. Roentgen, and he is inclined\r\nto consider them as due to _longitudinal_ vibrations in the ether; that\r\nis, instead of the transverse waves to which light is attributed, these\r\nresemble the waves of sound, in so far that they move in the direction\r\nof propagation. This would account for the absence of any distinct\r\nrefraction, or polarisation, which seems to characterise the X rays.\r\nTheir connection with certain electric Maxwell-Hertz waves (see p. 541)\r\nis more problematical, as the mathematical formulæ for these admit only\r\ntransverse oscillation. But on the assumption of certain conditions, due\r\nto the action of electricity, etc., on highly rarefied air, the possible\r\nexistence of longitudinal vibrations has been deduced by admitting a\r\ncertain variation in some of the factors of the Maxwell formulæ.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions have been advanced in order to make the observed facts\r\nconcerning the X rays fit into established theories, but so far these\r\nattempts have been unsuccessful. It would seem as if our present\r\nconceptions of light, electricity, the ether and matter, will have to be\r\nprofoundly modified and enlarged in order to bring these and other\r\nrecently discovered phenomena within their scope. Since the publication\r\nof Dr. Roentgen’s paper, his results have received confirmation in every\r\nquarter, and many new observations have been added, some of which seem\r\nto tend not so much to elucidate the phenomena, as to prove them even\r\nmore complicated than was at first supposed. Such was the announcement\r\nin June, 1896, of the discovery of several varieties of X rays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 232_c_.—_Metal Objects taken through Calico and Sheet of\r\n    Aluminium._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, various modifications have been made in the forms of\r\nthe tubes and electrodes, and divers arrangements have been used for the\r\nexciting electrical apparatus. Thus it has been found that the X rays\r\nare given off from platinum more copiously than from glass, aluminium,\r\nor any other substance, and by using a tube closed by a “platinum\r\nwindow,” on which the cathode rays impinge, Mr. Gifford has been able to\r\nreduce the time of exposure for obtaining a skiagraph of the bones on\r\nthe hand to half a minute, whereas twenty times that period was formerly\r\nrequired. Another form of tube is advertised by Brady & Martin of\r\nNewcastle, with which, in conjunction with a new screen, a coil giving a\r\n5–inch spark will, it is stated, yield a good skiagraph of the hand in\r\n_two seconds_, which appears to be the shortest time yet attained.\r\nAnother firm of tube-makers, Newton & Co., London, state that their\r\nspecial form of tube, excited by a coil giving a 6–inch spark, and used\r\nwith their fluorescent screen, “will work right through the human body,\r\nshowing the heart, liver, spine, ribs, the movements of the heart and of\r\nthe diaphragm, etc.” It has recently been observed that the best results\r\nare obtained when there is a certain, but as yet undefined, relation\r\nbetween the degree of rarefaction of the residual gas in the tube, and\r\nthe intensity or frequency of the electric discharges, and that these\r\nshould be accommodated to the work required. Thus, for example, if a\r\nskiagraph of the hand be attempted with an apparatus in which these\r\nfactors are carried to too high a degree, the resulting X rays will pass\r\nthrough the bones almost as freely as through the surrounding tissues,\r\nand their shadows will therefore not appear. If, on the other hand, the\r\ncontrary conditions hold, an incomplete or maybe no result will be\r\nfound. This seems to explain the failures that have sometimes occurred\r\nwhen tubes of apparently identical construction have been used in the\r\nhands of the same, or of different, observers. Perhaps more depends also\r\non the time of exposure. For instance, if a short exposure be given in\r\nthe case of the hand, the photograph will be merely a silhouette of that\r\nmember; with a little longer exposure, this will show the nails; with\r\nstill longer time, the shadow of the fleshy parts begins to grow faint\r\nand the skeleton to appear. With yet more prolonged exposure only the\r\nbones will show, in their various degrees of opacity, and the shadows of\r\nthese will gradually disappear as the time of exposure is increased,\r\nuntil at length the image will be entirely effaced. The considerable\r\ndifferences as to distinctness of the various tissues, which are\r\nexhibited by the published prints of hand shadows, are thus explicable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 232_d_.—_A Skiagraph of Layers of Various Substances._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 233.—_Portrait of Professor Helmholtz._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigations of modern science have borne rich fruit, not only by\r\nvastly extending our knowledge of the universe of things around us, but\r\nalso making us acquainted with the mode in which certain agents act upon\r\nour bodily organs, and by revealing, up to a certain point, what may be\r\ntermed the mechanism of that most wonderful thing—the human mind—or, at\r\nleast, that part which is immediately concerned in the perceptions of an\r\nexternal world. Of all the physical influences which affect the human\r\nmind, those due to light are the most powerful and the most agreeable.\r\nOne of the most ancient of philosophers says, in the simple words which\r\nare appropriate to the expression of an undeniable truth, “Truly the\r\nlight is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the\r\nsun.” The impression produced by light alone is a source of pleasure—a\r\ncheering influence of the highest order; and there is a special\r\ncharacter in the pleasing effects of light, from the circumstance that\r\nthey do not exhaust the sense so quickly as do even pleasurable\r\nimpressions on other organs—such as sweet tastes, fragrant odours, or\r\nagreeable sounds. Sight is not liable to that satiety which soon\r\novertakes the enjoyment of sensations arising from the other senses; it\r\npossesses, therefore, a refinement of quality of which the rest are\r\ndevoid. Sight converses with its objects at a greater distance than does\r\nany other sense, and it furnishes our minds with a greater variety of\r\nideas. Indeed, our mental imagery is most largely made up of\r\nreminiscences of visual impressions; for when the idea of anything is\r\nbrought up in our minds by a word, for example, there arises, in most\r\ncases, a more or less vivid presentation of some visible appearance. Our\r\nvisual impressions are also longer retained in memory or idea than any\r\nother class of sensations.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the impressions we receive through the eye is extremely\r\nvaried; for we thus perceive not only the difference between light and\r\ndarkness, but in the sensations of colour we have quite another class of\r\neffects, while the lustre and sparkle of polished and brilliant objects\r\nadd new elements of beauty and variety. We find examples of the latter\r\nqualities in the verdant sheen of the smooth leaf, in the splendid\r\nreflections of burnished gold, in the bright radiance of glittering\r\ngems, and “in gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls.” The eye is also the\r\norgan which conveys to our minds the impressions of visible motion, with\r\nall those pleasures of exciting spectacle which enter so largely into\r\nour enjoyment of life. It likewise discriminates the forms, sizes, and\r\ndistances of objects; but by a process long misunderstood, and dependent\r\nupon a set of perceptions which, although precisely those whence we\r\nderive our most fundamental notions of the objects around us, have been\r\ncompletely overlooked in that time-honoured enumeration of the senses\r\nwhich recognizes only five.\r\n\r\nIf such be the extent to which our minds are dependent upon the\r\nwonderful apparatus of the eye, it may easily be imagined what must be\r\nthe comparative narrowness of mental development in those who have never\r\nenjoyed this precious sense, and the feeling of deprivation in those,\r\nwho, having enjoyed it, have unfortunately lost it. Well may our sublime\r\npoet despairingly ask—\r\n\r\n               “Since light so necessary is to life,\r\n               And almost life itself—if it be true\r\n               That light is in the soul—\r\n               The all in every part: why was the sight\r\n               To such a tender ball as the eye confined,\r\n               So obvious and so easy to be quenched?”\r\n\r\n—for he himself, in his own person, experienced this deprivation, and he\r\nthus touchingly, in his great work, laments his loss:\r\n\r\n                            “Thus with the year\r\n              Seasons return; but not to me returns\r\n              Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,\r\n              Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer’s rose,\r\n              Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;\r\n              But cloud instead, and ever-during dark\r\n              Surround me; from the cheerful ways of men\r\n              Cut off; and for the book of knowledge fair\r\n              Presented with a universal blank\r\n              Of Nature’s works—to me expunged and rased,\r\n              And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.”\r\n\r\nAn organ which is the instrument of so many nice discriminations as is\r\nthe eye must, of course, present the most delicate adjustment in its\r\nparts. So much has in recent times been learnt of the nature of its\r\nmechanism; of the relation between the impressions made upon it and the\r\njudgments formed by the mind therefrom; of the illusions which its very\r\nstructure produces; of the defects to which it is liable; and of its\r\nwonderfully refined physiological elements—that a branch of science\r\nsufficiently extensive to require a large part of a studious lifetime\r\nfor its complete mastery has grown up under the hands of modern\r\nphysiologists, physicists, and psychologists. To some of the results of\r\ntheir labour we would invite the reader’s attention; and in order to\r\nrender the account of them intelligible, we must, to a certain extent,\r\ndescribe “things new and old.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _THE EYE._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 234.—_Vertical Section of the Eye._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe form of the human eye and the general arrangement of its parts may\r\nbe understood by referring to Fig. 234, which is a section of the\r\neyeball. It has a form nearly globular, and is covered on the outside by\r\na tough firm case, A, named the _sclerotic coat_, which is, for the most\r\npart, white and opaque. This covering it is which forms what is commonly\r\ntermed the “white of the eye;” but in the front part of the eyeball it\r\nloses its opacity, and merges into a transparent substance, termed the\r\n_cornea_, B. The cornea has a greater convexity than the rest of the\r\nexterior of the eyeball, so that it causes the front part of the eye to\r\nhave a somewhat greater projection than would result from its general\r\nglobular form. This sclerotic coat—with its continuation, the\r\ncornea—serves to support and protect the more delicate parts within, and\r\nis itself kept in shape by the _humours_, which fill the whole of the\r\ninterior. The greater space is occupied by the _vitreous humour_, C; but\r\nthe space immediately behind the transparent cornea is filled with the\r\n_aqueous humour_, D. The latter is little else than pure water, and the\r\nformer is like thin transparent jelly. The cavities containing these two\r\nhumours are separated by the transparent double convex lens, E, called\r\nthe _crystalline lens_, which, in consistence, resembles very thick\r\njelly or soft gristle. The outward surface of this lens has a flatter\r\ncurvature than the inner surface. Immediately in front of the\r\ncrystalline lens is found the _iris_, F, which may be described as a\r\ncurtain having in the middle a round hole. The iris is the part which\r\nvaries in colour from one individual to another—being blue, brown, grey,\r\n&c.; and the aperture in its centre is the dark circular spot termed the\r\n_pupil_.\r\n\r\nThe general disposition of the parts of the eye with regard to light\r\nwill be most easily understood by comparing it with an optical\r\ninstrument, to which it bears no little resemblance, namely, the _camera\r\nobscura_, so well known in connection with photography. We may picture\r\nto ourselves a still more complete resemblance, by imagining that the\r\nlens of the camera is single, that we have fixed in front of it a\r\nwatch-glass, with the convex side outwards, and that we have filled with\r\nwater the whole of the interior of the camera, including the space\r\nbetween the watch-glass and the lens. The _focussing-screen_ of the\r\ncamera corresponds with the inner surface of the back of the eyeball,\r\nabout which we shall presently have more to say. Now, even if the camera\r\nhad no lens, but were simply a box filled with water, and having in\r\nfront the watch-glass, fixed in the manner just mentioned, we could\r\nobtain the images of objects on the screen, as a consequence of the\r\ncurvature of the watch-glass. It would, however, in this case, be\r\nnecessary to have the camera much longer, or, in other words, the rays\r\nwould be brought to a focus at a greater distance than if we put in the\r\nglass lens, which would, thus placed in the water, cause the rays to\r\nconverge to a focus at a much shorter distance, although its effect when\r\nsurrounded by water would be less powerful than in the air. There we see\r\nthe effect of the crystalline lens of the eye in bringing the rays to a\r\nfocus within a much shorter distance than that which would be required\r\nhad there been present only the curved cornea, and the aqueous and\r\nvitreous humours of the eye, which are but little different from pure\r\nwater in their optical properties.\r\n\r\nIf we _focus_ the camera by adjusting the distance between the lens and\r\nthe screen so as to get a distinct image of a near object, we should\r\nfind, on directing the instrument to a distant one, that the image would\r\nbe blurred and indistinct, and the lens would have to be moved nearer to\r\nthe screen; or we could get the image of the distant object distinct by\r\nreplacing the lens by another lens in the same position, but having some\r\nflatter curvature. It is plain that the same object would be gained if\r\nour lens could be made of some elastic material, which, on being pulled\r\nout radially at its edges, could be made to assume the required degree\r\nof flatness without losing its lenticular form. Now, it is precisely\r\nwith an automatic adjustment of this kind that the _crystalline lens_ of\r\nthe eye is provided, for the lens is suspended by an elastic ligament,\r\nG, by the tension of which its surfaces are more flattened than they\r\nwould otherwise be; but when the tension of this ligament is relaxed, by\r\nthe action of certain delicate muscles which draw it down, the\r\nelasticity of the lens causes it to assume a more convex form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 235. _Section of Retina._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese optical adjustments give, on the inner surface of the coats of the\r\neye, a more or less perfect real image of the objects to which the eye\r\nis directed, and it is on the back part of this inner surface that the\r\nnetwork of nerves, called the _retina_, H, is spread out. The sclerotic\r\ncoat, already spoken of, is lined internally with another, named the\r\n_choroid_, which is composed of delicate blood-vessels, intermingled\r\nwith a tissue of cells filled with a substance of an intensely black\r\ncolour. It is upon this last layer that the delicate membrane of the\r\nretina is spread out between the choroid and the vitreous humour.\r\n\r\nThe retina is, in part, an expansion of the fibres of the optic nerve\r\nover the back part of the eyeball. If we suppose the globe of this cut\r\nvertically into two portions, and so divide the front from the back part\r\nof the eye, the retina would be seen spread out on the concave surface\r\nof the back part, and in the middle of this part, opposite the\r\ncrystalline lens, would be seen a spot in which the retina assumes a\r\nyellowish colour, and in the centre of this, a little round pit or\r\ndepression. The spot is called the _macula lutea_, or _yellow spot_, and\r\nthe little central pit, which is of the highest importance in vision, is\r\ntermed the _fovea centralis_. A little way from the yellow spot, and\r\nnearer the nose, is a point from which a number of fibres are seen to\r\nradiate, and this is, in fact, the part at which the optic nerve enters\r\nthe eyeball, and from which it sends out its ramifications over the\r\nretina. This part, for a reason which will shortly appear, is called the\r\n_blind spot_.\r\n\r\nWhen the minute structure of the retina is examined by the microscope,\r\nits physiological elements are found to undergo very remarkable\r\nmodifications at the yellow spot. In the retina, although the total\r\nthickness does not exceed the 1/80th part of an inch, no fewer than\r\neight or ten different essential or nervous layers have been\r\ndistinguished. Fig. 235 rudely represents a section. The lowest stratum,\r\nA, which is next the choroid, and forms about a quarter of the total\r\nthickness, is formed of a multitude of little rod-shaped bodies, _a_,\r\nranged side by side, and among these are the conical or bottle-shaped\r\nbodies, _b_. This lowest stratum of the retina is called the _layer of\r\nrods and cones_. At their front extremities the rods and cones pass into\r\nvery delicate fibres, which, going through an extremely fine layer of\r\nfibres, B, are connected with a series of small rounded bodies, which\r\nform the layer of _nuclei_, C, separated by a layer of nervous fibres,\r\nD, from a granular layer, E, in front of which is a stratum of still\r\nfiner granules, F, underlying a layer of ganglionic nerve-cells, G, of a\r\nlarger size than any of the other elements, and these ganglionic cells\r\nsend out numerous branching nerve-fibres, forming the layer H. Finally,\r\non the front surface of the retina there is a thin stratum formed of\r\nfibres, which issue from the optic nerve, K, Fig. 234, and in fact\r\nconstitute the expansion of this nerve on the inner surface of the\r\neyeball. The terminations of some, at least, of these nerve-fibres have\r\nbeen traced, and have been found to form junctions with those branching\r\nfrom the ganglionic cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 236.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the part played by each of these delicate structures in exciting\r\nvisual impressions little is yet known. How light, or the pulsations of\r\nether, if such there be, is ultimately converted into sensation will\r\nprobably for ever remain a mystery, although it is quite likely that the\r\nkind of visual impression which is conveyed by each part of the\r\nelaborate structure of the retina may ultimately be distinguished. One\r\ncurious result of modern investigation is that _light falling directly\r\nupon fibres of the optic nerve is quite incapable of exciting any\r\nsensation whatever_. Light has no more effect on this nerve and its\r\nfibres than it would have on any other nerve of the body if exposed to\r\nits action. The apparatus of rods, cones, and other structures are\r\nabsolutely essential to enable light to give that stimulus to the optic\r\nnerve which, conveyed to the brain, is converted into visual sensations.\r\nSo if this apparatus were absent in our organs of vision, in vain would\r\nthe optic nerve proper be spread out over the interior of the eyeball:\r\nwe should be no more able to _see_ with such eyes than we are able to\r\nsee with our hands.\r\n\r\nWe now invite the reader’s careful consideration to the diagram, Fig.\r\n236, which is a section of the retina through the yellow spot. The upper\r\npart of the figure is the front, and the deep depression is the little\r\npit already spoken of—the _fovea centralis_. The lowest dark line\r\nrepresents the basement membrane of the retina, and immediately above is\r\nseen the layer of rods and cones, and the various strata already spoken\r\nof are represented in their due order in the marginal parts of the\r\ndiagram. Now observe the remarkable modifications of the nervous\r\nstructures in the neighbourhood of the _fovea centralis_, some of which\r\nare visible in the diagram. In the first place, the cones are there much\r\nlonger, more slender, and more closely set, so that there is a far\r\ngreater number of them on a given surface; but the rods are\r\ncomparatively few, and are, in fact, not found at all under the floor of\r\nthe little pit. The layer of _nuclei_, into which the cones extend, is\r\nthinner, and is found almost immediately below the anterior surface, for\r\nall the other layers thin out in the fovea in a very curious manner. It\r\nis, however on the margin of the fovea that the stratum of ganglionic\r\ncells, G, Fig. 235, attains its greatest thickness, for there it is\r\nformed by the superposition of eight or ten cells, being here thicker\r\nthan any other layer, while it is so thinned off towards the margin of\r\nthe retina that it no longer forms even a continuous stratum. This\r\nlayer, however, becomes much thinner _in the fovea_, which contains, in\r\nfact, but few superposed cells. The tint of the yellow spot is said to\r\nbe derived from a colouring matter, which affects all the layers except\r\nthat of the cones. The centre of the yellow spot, where the _fovea\r\ncentralis_ is situated, is extremely transparent, and is so delicate\r\nthat it is very easily ruptured, and has frequently been taken for an\r\naperture.\r\n\r\nWe should not have risked wearying the reader with these details\r\nconcerning the little pit in the centre of the retina had it not\r\npossessed an extreme importance in the mechanism of the eye, a fact\r\nwhich he will at once appreciate when we say that _of the whole surface\r\nof the retina, the only spot where the image of an object can produce\r\ndistinct vision is the fovea centralis_. Since this is undoubtedly true,\r\nit follows that the physiological elements which we there find are\r\nprecisely those which are most essential for producing this effect. The\r\ncase may be exemplified by recurring to the comparison of the eye with a\r\nphotographer’s camera, by supposing his screen to be of such a nature\r\nthat only on one _very small spot_ near its centre could a distinct\r\nimage be possibly obtained of just one point of an object. Such a defect\r\nin his camera would render the photographer’s art impossible, and this\r\ndefect (if it may be so called) in the eye would render it almost\r\nequally useless, had not an adjustment, which more than compensates for\r\nit, been afforded in the extreme _mobility_ of our organs of vision.\r\nThis adjustment is so perfect that people in general do not even suspect\r\nthat the image of _each point_ of an object which they distinctly see\r\nmust be formed on one particular spot on the retina—a spot about\r\none-tenth of the diameter of an ordinary pin-head! We may venture,\r\nwithout any disrespect to the reader, to assume that the chances are\r\nthat it is new to him to learn how each letter in the lines beneath his\r\neye must successively, but momentarily, form its image in the very\r\nlittle pit in the centre of his retina; and the chances are at least a\r\nhundred to one that, even if aware of this, he has passively received\r\nthe statement, and that he has not made the least attempt to _realize\r\nthe truth for himself_. Yet nothing is easier. Let him request a friend\r\nto slowly peruse some printed page, while he meanwhile intently watches\r\nhis friend’s eyes. He will then perceive that before a single word can\r\nbe read there is a _movement_ of the eyeballs, which are, quite\r\nunconsciously to the person reading, so directed that the image of each\r\nletter (for the area of distinct vision is incapable of receiving more\r\nthan this at once) shall fall upon the only parts of the retinæ from\r\nwhich a distinct impression can be conveyed along the optic nerve. Thus\r\nit is that the eye, without any conscious effort of the observer, is\r\ndirected in succession to the various points of an object, and it is\r\nonly by an effort of will in fixing the eyes upon one spot that one\r\nbecomes aware of the blurred and confused forms of all the rest of the\r\nvisual picture. Yet so readily do the eyeballs turn to any part of the\r\nindistinct picture on which the attention is fixed, that it is not\r\nimprobable a person unversed in such experiments, wishing to verify our\r\nconclusions by looking, say, at one spot on the opposite wall, will be\r\nvery apt, in thinking of the features of the rest of the picture, to\r\ndirect his eyes there, and then declare that he, at least, sees no such\r\nvague forms. If such be his experience, the correction is easy. He has\r\nonly to ask some one to watch closely his eyes while he repeats the\r\nexperiment, and after a few trials he will succeed in maintaining the\r\nrequisite immobility of the eyeballs—a condition upon which the success\r\nof many such experiments depends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 237.—_Muscles of Eyes._\r\n\r\n  The muscles of the eyeballs viewed from above:—B, the internal rectus;\r\n    E, the external rectus; S, the superior rectus; T, the superior\r\n    oblique, passing through a loop of ligament at U, and turning\r\n    outwards and downwards to its insertion at C. The inferior rectus\r\n    and the inferior oblique are not visible in the figure: the superior\r\n    rectus is removed from the right eyeball in order to show the optic\r\n    nerve N.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis extreme mobility of the eyeballs more than compensates for the loss\r\nof the clear and well-defined picture, for it calls into action one of\r\nthe most sensitive of all the impressions of which we are capable, and\r\none which possesses in so high a degree the power of uniting with our\r\nother sensations, that this sixth sense has been, as already stated,\r\nutterly overlooked, except by the more modern students of the nature of\r\nour sensations. It is usually termed the _muscular sense_, and to it are\r\ndue some of the nicest distinctions of impressions of which we are\r\ncapable. The muscles of every part of our frame take their part in\r\nproducing impressions in our minds, and those of the eyeballs have a\r\nvery large share in furnishing us with ideas of forms and motions. Fig.\r\n237 is a diagram showing the general arrangement of these muscles; and\r\ntheir anatomical designations, which need not much concern us at\r\npresent, are given beneath the figure. The wonder is, that the\r\nsensations arising from the relative conditions of parts so few, should\r\nafford us the immense variety of notions referrible for their origin to\r\nthese muscles only. We take one example in illustration. Suppose we\r\nwatch the flight of a bird, at such an elevation that no part of the\r\nlandscape comes into the field of view at all; and that, again, we\r\nfollow with the eye, under similar circumstances, the path of a rocket.\r\nWe can unhesitatingly pronounce the motions unlike, and yet in each case\r\nthere was no visual impression present but that of the object focussed\r\nupon the yellow spot. But the movement of _the muscles in one case_ was\r\ndifferent from that in the other. Nay more, we can form such a judgment\r\nof the motion as to pronounce that the object followed such and such a\r\ncurve—we may recognize the parabola in one path, and the circle,\r\nperhaps, in the other. And this kind of discrimination arises from the\r\nfact, that when we have, maybe times without number, previously looked\r\nat parabolas and circles, in diagrams perhaps, the muscles of the\r\neyeballs have performed just the same series of movements, as point\r\nafter point of the line was made to form its image on the yellow spot.\r\nThis is not the only class of impressions that these muscles are capable\r\nof affording; there is, for example, little doubt that they aid us in\r\nestimating distance. But space will not permit further discussion of\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nAlthough the blurred and indefinite retinal picture may be compensated,\r\nand perhaps more than compensated, by the readiness with which the eyes\r\nmove, it is, of course, possible that greater precision and delicacy of\r\nvisual impression over the whole surface of the retina might be\r\nconsistent with a still greater increase of our powers of perception.\r\nThere are instances in which the absence of finish, as it may be termed,\r\nin all but one little spot in the picture, proves a real inconvenience\r\nand a sensible deprivation. Perhaps a friend calls our attention to the\r\nfact that a balloon is sailing through the air, or some fine morning,\r\nhearing in the fields the blithe song of the sky-lark, we look up and\r\nvainly try to bring the small image upon the place of distinct vision.\r\nNow, if an image which falls upon any other part of the retina is\r\nperceived, even indistinctly, an instant suffices to direct the eyes\r\ninto the exact position requisite for clear vision—an example of the\r\nmarvellous precision with which impressions are put in relation to each\r\nother by the unconscious action of the brain. But while an image on the\r\nfovea, only 1/6000th of an inch diameter, produces a distinct sensation,\r\nit is found that if the image falls on the retina at a point some\r\ndistance from the yellow spot, the image must be 150 times larger in\r\norder to produce any impression; and it is in consequence of the image\r\nof balloon or bird not having the requisite size to give any impression\r\nto the less sensitive portion of the retina, that we grope blindly, as\r\nit were, until by chance the image falls near the yellow spot, when the\r\ntentative motion of the eyeballs is instantly arrested, and the image\r\nfixed. On the other hand, the field of indistinct vision which the eye\r\ntakes in is extremely wide, for bright objects are thus perceived, even\r\nwhen their direction forms an angle laterally of nearly 90° with the\r\naxis of the eye; and, if the object be not only bright, but in motion,\r\nits presence is noticed under such circumstances with still greater\r\nease. Thus, an observer scanning the heavens would have a perception of\r\na shooting star anywhere within nearly half the hemisphere. The range\r\nis, however, less than 90° in a vertical direction.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the fibres of the optic nerve, entering the back part\r\nof the eyeball, at K, Fig. 234, ramify over the anterior surface of the\r\nretina in fibres which form a layer of considerable relative thickness.\r\nThe light, therefore, first encounters these nerves, and only after\r\ntraversing their transparent substance does it reach the deeper seated\r\nlayer of rods and cones, where it excites some action that is capable of\r\nstimulating the optic nerve. These rods and cones might naturally be\r\nsupposed to be merely accessory to the fibres of the optic nerve, had we\r\nnot the following conclusive evidence that the cones play a necessary\r\npart in the action, and that it is only through them that light acts\r\nupon the optic nerve:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 238.\r\n]\r\n\r\n1. The cones are more developed and more numerous in the spot where\r\nvision is most distinct.\r\n\r\n2. The “blind spot” is full of fibres of the optic nerve, but is\r\nabsolutely insensible to light, and is without rods or cones.\r\n\r\n3. We can distinguish an image on the fovea, having only 1/6000th of an\r\ninch diameter; but on the other parts of the retina the images must have\r\nlarger dimensions. It is found that the size of the smallest\r\ndistinguishable images agrees nearly with the diameters of the cones at\r\nthe respective parts.\r\n\r\nTo some readers the fact will doubtless be new, that a considerable\r\nportion of the eye is quite insensible to light, namely, that portion\r\nalready designated as the “blind spot.” A simple experiment, made by\r\nhelp of Fig. 238, will prove this. Place the book so that the length of\r\nthe figure may be parallel to the line joining the eyes, and let the\r\nright eye be exactly opposite the white cross, and at a distance from it\r\nof about 11 in. If the left eye be now closed, while with the right the\r\ncross is steadily viewed so that it is _always_ clear and distinct, the\r\nwhite circle will completely disappear, and the ground will appear of a\r\nuniform black colour. In order to insure success, the observer must be\r\ncareful not to _look at_ the white circle, but at the cross, and some\r\npersons find this more difficult than others. The position of the blind\r\nspot in the eye has been already mentioned, and its significance in\r\nshowing the insensibility to light of the fibres of the optic nerve has\r\nbeen pointed out. In the table of the dimensions of some parts of the\r\neye, which, for convenience of reference, is given together below, it\r\nwill be seen that the diameter of the blind spot is considerable\r\ncompared with the size of the retina, its greatest diameter being about\r\n8/100 in. The length on the retina of the image of a man at a distance\r\nof 6 ft. or 7 ft. is not greater than this, so that in a certain\r\nposition with regard to the eye a person would, like the white circle,\r\nbe quite invisible. In like manner, by looking steadily in a certain\r\ndirection with one eye, the image of the full moon may be made to fall\r\nupon the blind spot, and the luminary then becomes invisible, and would\r\nbe so even if its apparent diameter were eleven times greater; so that\r\nif we suppose eleven full moons ranged in a line, the whole would be\r\nquite invisible to a person looking towards a certain point of the sky\r\nat no great angular distance from them.\r\n\r\nThe following are the dimensions in English inches of some parts of the\r\neye:\r\n\r\n                                                               In.\r\n  Diameter of the entrance of the optic nerve                  0·08\r\n  Distance of centre of optic nerve from centre of yellow spot 0·138\r\n  Diameter of _fovea centralis_                                0·008\r\n  Diameter of the nerve-cells of the retina                    0·0005\r\n  Diameter of the _nuclei_                                     0·00003\r\n  Diameter of the rods                                         0·00004\r\n  Diameter of the cones in yellow spot                         0·00018\r\n  Length of rods                                               0·0016\r\n  Length of cones in yellow spot                               0·0008\r\n  Thickness of retina at the back of the eye                   0·0058\r\n\r\nBy means of an instrument to be presently described, the ophthalmoscope,\r\nit is possible to view directly the whole surface of the retina, and to\r\nobserve the inverted images of the objects there depicted. It is thus\r\nobserved that it is only on the parts near the yellow spot that the\r\nimages are formed with clear and sharp definition. Away from this the\r\ndefinition is less perfect; and besides the diminished sensitiveness of\r\nthe retina, this circumstance contributes to the vagueness of the visual\r\npicture, although the falling off in clearness of vision at a very\r\nlittle distance from the yellow spot is far more marked than the loss of\r\ndefinition in the image there formed.\r\n\r\nUntil within the last few years it has been most confidently asserted by\r\nmany authors that the eye, considered as an _optical instrument_, is\r\nabsolutely perfect, and entirely free from certain defects to which\r\nartificial instruments are liable. Thus Dr. W. B. Carpenter states, in\r\nhis “Animal Physiology” (1859): “The eye is much more remarkable for its\r\nperfection as an optical instrument than we might be led to suppose from\r\nthe cursory view we have hitherto taken of its functions; for, by the\r\npeculiarities of its construction, certain faults and defects are\r\navoided, to which all ordinary optical instruments are liable.” Among\r\nthe imperfections which are completely corrected in the eye, he names\r\n“spherical aberration” and “chromatic aberration”—both of which give\r\nrise to certain defects in optical instruments. But by recent careful\r\ninvestigations it has been conclusively shown that the eye is not free\r\nfrom chromatic aberration; that it has defects analogous to spherical\r\naberration; and that there are, besides, certain optical imperfections\r\nin its structure, which are avoided in the artificial instruments.\r\nProfessor Helmholtz, one of the most distinguished of German\r\nmathematicians, physicists, and physiologists, whose great work on\r\n“Physiological Optics” is the most complete treatise on the subject\r\nwhich has ever appeared, is so far from considering the eye as possessed\r\nof all optical perfections that he remarks that, should an optician send\r\nhim an instrument having like _optical_ defects, he would feel justified\r\nin sending it back. The defects which may be traced in the eye,\r\n_considered as an optical instrument_, do not, however, he admits,\r\ndetract from the excellence of the eye _considered as the organ of\r\nvision_.\r\n\r\nWhen we find that Sir Isaac Newton pointed out the chromatic aberration\r\nof the eye two centuries ago—when we find that D’Alembert, in 1767,\r\nproved that the lenses of the eye might have as great a dispersive power\r\nas glass without the want of achromatism necessarily becoming\r\nnoticeable—when we find that the celebrated optician Dolland, the\r\ninventor of the achromatic lens, showed that the refractions which take\r\nplace in the eye all tend to bring the violet rays towards the axis more\r\nthan the red—when we find that Maskelyne the astronomer, Wollaston the\r\nphysicist, Fraunhofer the optician, and other scarcely less\r\ndistinguished men of science, have made actual measurements of the\r\ndistances of the _foci_ in the human eye for the different rays of the\r\nspectrum—when we find how these defects have so long ago been observed,\r\nexamined, and measured as to their amount—the persistence with which\r\nwriter after writer has asserted the achromatism of the human eye\r\nappears so extraordinary, that it can only be accounted for by the\r\nprevalence of the preconceived notion that the eye is absolutely\r\nperfect—a notion not without its reason and grounds, in the fact of the\r\nexquisite adaptation of the organ of sight to the needs of humanity.\r\n\r\nAlthough the want of achromatism in the eye thus escapes ordinary\r\nnotice, it is, on the other hand, easy to render it evident by simple\r\nexperiments. If, for example, we view from a certain distance the solar\r\nspectrum projected on a white screen, it will be found that, when we see\r\nthe red end quite distinctly, the violet end will, at the same time,\r\nappear vague and confused, and _vice versâ_. The author believes that\r\nthe following very simple experiment will at once convince any person\r\nthat the fact is as stated. Procure a small piece of blue or _violet_\r\nstained glass, and another piece of _red_ glass, and, having cut out of\r\nan opaque screen a rectangular opening, say ½ in. long and ¼ in. wide,\r\nplace the glasses close to it, so that one-half the opening is covered\r\nby the red glass and the other half by the violet glass, the two being\r\nplaced so that, on looking through the screen, a violet square and a red\r\nsquare are visible. The opaque screen may be made of black paper,\r\ncardboard, or tinfoil, and the edges of the opening must be cut\r\nperfectly even. On looking through this arrangement, held at a distance\r\nof about two feet from the eye, both squares may be seen distinctly by a\r\nperson of ordinary vision; but, at a distance of five inches from the\r\neye, he will find it impossible to see the squares otherwise than with\r\nvague and ill-defined edges. This is because the crystalline lens cannot\r\nadapt its curvature so as to bring the rays from the object to a focus\r\non the retina. Now, by trial, the nearest distance at which each of the\r\ncoloured squares becomes visible may be found, and it will be observed,\r\nthat the violet square is first sharply defined at a less distance than\r\nthe red, whereas, if the eye brought the red and violet rays to a focus\r\nat the same point, the smallest distance of distinct vision would\r\ncoincide in both cases.\r\n\r\nThe reader may observe the same fact for himself, in even a still\r\nsimpler manner, by turning to Fig. 238, page 461. When the white circle\r\nis viewed by one eye, at a distance of about a foot, and an opaque\r\nscreen, such as a coin, is held close to the eye, so that the pupil is\r\nhalf covered by it, the one side of the white circle will appear\r\nbordered by a narrow fringe of blue, and the other side by a narrow\r\nfringe of orange. If the opaque screen be shifted from one side of the\r\npupil to the other, the colours will change places, the orange appearing\r\nalways on the same side of the white circle as the screen is held before\r\nthe eye. The same appearances are presented in a still more marked\r\ndegree when the full moon is made the subject of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe diagram, Fig. 239, shows the course of the red and violet rays from\r\na luminous point, A, the refraction being supposed to take place at\r\nB_{1} B_{2}. The violet rays after refraction form the cone, B_{1}, E,\r\nB_{2}, and E is their focus; the red rays form the cone, B_{1}, F,\r\nB_{2}, and have a focus at F. The position of the retina would be\r\nintermediate between E and F, and is indicated by C_{1}, C_{2}. It will\r\nbe noticed that the violet rays cross, and are received on the retina in\r\nthe same circle, G G, so that the colours, then blended, would be\r\nseparately imperceptible; but the point would produce a diffused\r\ncircular image of the blended colours.\r\n\r\nIn viewing an object—the moon, for example—the accommodation of the eye\r\nis like that indicated in the diagram. The distinct image due to the red\r\nrays would be formed behind the retina, and that due to the violet rays\r\nwould be in front of it. In the image on the retina the most intense\r\nrays—such as the orange, yellow, and green—are those which are blended\r\nby the adjustment of the eye, and the red and violet form images more\r\nout of focus (to use a common expression), and a very little larger than\r\nthe more intense image. We might expect that a white disc would\r\ntherefore appear with a fringe of colour, resulting from a mixture of\r\nred and violet; but the fringe is too narrow, and the colour itself too\r\nfeeble, to become perceptible. When, however, the pupil of the eye is\r\nhalf covered, the red and violet images are displaced in different\r\ndirections, the position of the retina being too far forward for the\r\none, and too far back for the other. The coincidence therefore ceasing,\r\nthe colours show themselves at the margins of the image.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 239.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe non-perception under ordinary circumstances of the chromatic\r\naberration of the eye is largely due to the greater intensity of the\r\ncolours which differ least in their refrangibilities. The clearness of\r\nour vision does not, therefore, practically suffer from this defect of\r\nthe eye. Professor Helmholtz constructed lenses which rendered his eyes\r\nreally achromatic, and looking through these when the pupil was half\r\ncovered, no coloured fringes were seen at the edges of dark or light\r\nobjects, or when the objects were looked at with an imperfect\r\naccommodation of the eye. He was, however, unable to detect any increase\r\nof clearness or distinctness of vision by the correction.\r\n\r\nThe eye is also subject to other aberrations and irregular refractions,\r\nwhich are special to itself; for example, with moderately illuminated\r\nobjects the crystalline lens produces images apparently well defined,\r\nand nothing is visible to suggest the absence of uniformity in its\r\nstructure. But when the light is intense, and concentrated in a small\r\nobject surrounded by a dark field, the irregular structure of the\r\ncrystalline lens shows itself in the most marked manner. Every one must\r\nhave noticed the appearance presented by the distant street-lamps on a\r\ndark night, and by the stars. The latter we know to be for us mere\r\npoints of light, and their images produced by perfect lenses would also\r\nbe mere points; instead of which we see what seem to be rays issuing\r\nfrom the star, an appearance which has given rise to the ordinary\r\nrepresentation of a star as a figure having several rays. That no such\r\nrays actually do emanate from the real star may be easily proved: first,\r\nby concealing the luminous point from view, by means of a small object\r\nheld up as a screen. If the rays had any existence outside of the eye,\r\nthey would still be seen; instead of which, the whole of them disappear\r\nwhen the luminous point, or, in the case of the street-lamp, when the\r\nflame, is covered by the screen. A second proof that the origin of the\r\nphenomenon is in the eye, and not in the object, is afforded by the fact\r\nthat if, while attentively observing the rays, we incline the head, the\r\nrays turn with the eyes, so that when the head is resting on the\r\nshoulder the ray which appeared vertical becomes horizontal. The cause\r\nof these divergences from the regular image lies in the fact of the\r\ncrystalline lens being built up of fibres which have refractive powers\r\nsomewhat different from that of the intermediate substance. These fibres\r\nare arranged in layers parallel to the surfaces of the crystalline lens,\r\nand the direction of the fibres in each layer is generally from the\r\ncentre to the circumference; but towards the axis they form, by bending,\r\na kind of six-rayed figure, as shown in Fig. 240, which represents the\r\narrangement of the fibres of the external layers of the lens. In the\r\noutermost layers the branches of the star-shaped figure are subdivided\r\ninto secondary branches, which give rise to more complicated figures.\r\nWhen we view by night a very brilliant but small light, even these\r\nsubdivisions may be traced in the radiating figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 240.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe light which enters the eye is partly absorbed by the black pigment\r\nof the choroid, and partly sent back by diffused reflection from the\r\nretina through the crystalline lens and pupil. The image of a luminous\r\nbody as depicted on the retina of another person cannot be seen by us\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, because, by the principle of reversibility\r\nalready mentioned as of universal application in optics, the rays which\r\nissue from the retinal images are refracted on leaving the eye, and\r\nfollow the same paths by which they entered it, so that they are sent\r\nback to the object. An observer cannot see the retinal image of a candle\r\nin another person’s eye, unless he allows the rays to enter his own, and\r\nthis cannot be done directly, because the head of the observer would be\r\ninterposed between the candle and the eye observed, and the light would\r\nthen be intercepted. By holding a piece of unsilvered plate glass\r\nvertically, we may reflect the light of a candle into the eye of another\r\nperson, and then the light thrown out from the retinal image of the\r\ncandle will, on again meeting the surface of the glass, be in part\r\nreflected to its source, and in part pass through the glass, on the\r\nother side of which it may be received into the eye of an observer. The\r\npositions of the observed and observing eye may be described as exactly\r\nopposite to and near each other, while the candle is placed to one side\r\nin the plane separating the two eyes, and the glass is held so that it\r\nforms an angle of 45° with the line joining the pupils. Under these\r\ncircumstances the observer may see the light at the back of the eye, but\r\nhe will not be able to distinguish anything clearly, because his own eye\r\ncannot accommodate itself so as to bring to a focus the rays coming from\r\nthe retina of the other, since these rays are refracted by the media\r\nthrough which they emerge. But, by means of suitable lenses interposed\r\nbetween the two eyes, the retina and all its details may be distinctly\r\nseen and examined. Such an arrangement of lenses and a reflecting\r\nsurface constitute the instrument called the _ophthalmoscope_ (οφθαλμος,\r\n_the eye_) of which there are many forms, but all constructed on the\r\nprinciple just indicated. This principle was first pointed out by\r\nHelmholtz, who described the first ophthalmoscope in 1851.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 241.—_Ruete’s Ophthalmoscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nRuete’s ophthalmoscope is represented in Fig. 241. The parts of the\r\ninstrument are supported on a stand, C, and about the vertical axis of\r\nthis the column, D, and the arms, H and K, can turn freely and\r\nindependently; E is a concave metallic mirror, about 3 in. in diameter,\r\nand having an aperture in its centre through which the observer, B,\r\nlooks. The arm, H, merely carries a black opaque screen, which serves to\r\nshield the eye of B from the light of the lamp, and to reduce, if\r\nrequired, the amount of light passing through the aperture in the\r\nmirror. The arm, K, which is about a foot in length, carries two\r\nuprights which slide along it, and in each of these slides a rod bearing\r\na lens, which can thus be adjusted into any required position. The\r\ninstrument is used in an apartment where all light but that of the lamp\r\ncan be excluded. In the instrument just described an inverted image is\r\nobtained, which is sufficient for ordinary medical purposes, but this\r\nconstruction does not allow of the examination of retinal images, which\r\nis best performed with an instrument having a plane mirror.\r\n\r\nThe appearance presented by the back of the eye when viewed in the\r\nophthalmoscope is represented in Fig. 242. The retina appears red,\r\nexcept at the place where the optic nerve enters, which is white. On the\r\nreddish ground the retinal blood-vessels can be distinguished; A, A, A,\r\nbranches of the retinal artery, have a brighter red colour, and more\r\nstrongly reflect the light than the branches, B, B, B, of the retinal\r\nvein. Among these, and especially towards the margin, are seen, more or\r\nless distinctly, the broader vessels of the choroid. Above the optic\r\nnerve and a little to the right may be observed the _fovea centralis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 242.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty years the ophthalmoscope has been the chief means\r\nof extending the knowledge of oculists regarding the diseased and\r\nhealthy conditions of the eye. In this way the substance of the lens and\r\nthe state of the humours can be directly seen, the causes of impaired\r\nvision can be discovered, and the nature of many maladies made out with\r\ncertainty. This modern invention, by which the interesting spectacle of\r\nthe interior of the living eye can be observed, has therefore been far\r\nfrom proving a barren triumph of science. Many insidious maladies can\r\nthus be detected, and may be successfully treated before the organ has\r\nbecome hopelessly diseased. In some cases the ophthalmoscope gives the\r\nmost certain evidence of the existence of obscure and unsuspected\r\ndiseases of other parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _VISUAL IMPRESSIONS_.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that, however well the flat picture of an object may\r\nimitate the colours and forms of nature, we are never deceived into\r\nsupposing that we have the real object before us. There must, therefore,\r\nbe something different in the conditions under which we see real objects\r\nfrom those under which we view their pictures. The most favourable\r\ncircumstances for receiving an illusive impression of solidity from a\r\nflat picture, is when we view it from a fixed position and with one eye.\r\nThis is because one means by which we unconsciously estimate distances\r\ndepends upon the changes in the perspective appearances of objects\r\ncaused by changes in our point of view. In many cases these changes in\r\nthe perspective are the only means we have of judging of the relative\r\ndistances of objects. But there is another circumstance which is still\r\nmore intimately connected with our perception of solidity. Each eye\r\nreceives a slightly different image of the objects before us (unless\r\nthese be extremely remote), inasmuch as they are viewed from a different\r\npoint. When the objects are very near, the two retinal images may differ\r\nconsiderably, as the reader may convince himself by viewing with each\r\neye, alternately, objects immediately before him, while the other eye is\r\nclosed, and the head all the while motionless. The nearer objects will\r\nplainly appear to shift their positions as seen against the back-ground\r\nof the more distant objects; and a somewhat more careful observation\r\nwill reveal changes of perspective, or apparent form, in every one of\r\nthese objects. An extreme case is presented in that of a playing card,\r\nor thin book, held in the plane which divides the eyes. The back or the\r\nface, the one side or the other, will be seen, according as the right or\r\nthe left eye is opened. If we close the left eye, the displacement and\r\nchange of apparent form produced by a slight movement of the head are\r\nsufficiently obvious; a movement of the head 2½ in. to the left causes a\r\ndecided change in the relative positions of adjacent objects. It is\r\nplain, however, that it is precisely from a point 2½ in. to the left\r\nthat the left eye views these objects, and hence the perspective\r\nappearance seen by the left eye must have the difference due to this\r\nshifting of the point of view.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if one looks at a picture, or flat surface, placed\r\nimmediately in front, no change in the relative positions of its parts\r\nis discernible by viewing it with either eye alternately. Not but that\r\nthere is a difference in the retinal images in the two cases, but there\r\nis an absence of any point of comparison by which the change may be\r\njudged. If we take a photograph of a statue, it will, when viewed by one\r\nor the other eye, present the difference of the retinal images which is\r\ndue to a flat surface; the parts of the photographic image will be of\r\nslightly different proportions as seen by each eye. If, instead of the\r\nphotograph we have before our eyes a statuette, each eye will see a\r\nquite different view: the right eye will see a portion which is\r\ninvisible to the left eye, and _vice versâ_, and, in fact, we shall see\r\nmore than half round the object. Here, then, we have certain differences\r\nof the retinal pictures when solid objects are viewed, and these\r\ndifferences by innumerable repetitions have, unconsciously to ourselves,\r\nbecome associated with notions of solidity, of something having length,\r\nbreadth, and depth, or thickness. The marvellous delicacy of these\r\nperceptions will be alluded to hereafter.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the lenses of two cameras are fixed in the positions\r\noccupied by the two eyes, and that a photograph is taken in each camera,\r\nthe subject being, for example, a statuette. It is obvious that the\r\ndifferences of the two photographs would correspond with the differences\r\nof the two retinal images, and that, if a person could view with the\r\nright eye only the photograph taken in the right-hand camera, and with\r\nthe left eye the left-hand photograph only, there would be formed on the\r\nretinæ of his eyes images very nearly corresponding with those which the\r\nactual object would produce, and the result would be, if these retinal\r\npictures occupied the proper position on the eyes, that the impression\r\nof solidity would be produced, which is called the _stereoscopic\r\neffect_.\r\n\r\nThis may be done without the aid of any instrument, as almost any person\r\nmay discover after some trials with nothing but a _stereoscopic slide_,\r\nif he can succeed in maintaining the optic axis of his eyes quite\r\nparallel. In such a case he will observe the stereoscopic effect by the\r\nfusing together, as it were, into one sensation, of the impression\r\nreceived by the right eye from the right photograph, with that received\r\nby the left eye from the left photograph. But as each eye will, at the\r\nsame time, have the photograph intended for the other in the field of\r\nview, the observer will be conscious of a non-stereoscopic image on each\r\nside of the central stereoscopic one. These outside images are, however,\r\nvery distracting, for the moment the attention is in the least directed\r\nto them, the optic axes converge to the one side or the other, losing\r\ntheir parallelism, and the stereoscopic effect vanishes, because the\r\nimages no longer fall in the usual positions on the retinæ. It is, in\r\nconsequence, only after some practice that one succeeds in readily\r\nviewing stereoscopic slides in this manner, but the acquirement is a\r\nconvenient one when a person has rapidly to inspect a number of such\r\nslides, for he can see them stereoscopically without putting them in the\r\ninstrument. Many persons, however, find great difficulty in acquiring\r\nthis power. In such cases it is well to begin by separating the two\r\nphotographs by means of a piece of cardboard, covered with black paper\r\non both sides. When this is held in the plane between the eyes, each eye\r\nsees only its own photograph, and the observer is not troubled with the\r\ntwo exterior images. After a little practice in this way, the cardboard\r\nmay usually be dispensed with, and the observer will insensibly have\r\nacquired the habit of viewing the slides stereoscopically, without any\r\naid whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 243.—_Wheatstone’s Reflecting Stereoscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nInstruments have, however, been contrived which enable one to obtain the\r\ndesired result without effort; and one form of these is now tolerably\r\nwell known to everybody. The first stereoscope was the invention of\r\nWheatstone. The reflecting stereoscope is represented in Fig. 243, and\r\nconsists essentially of two plane metallic mirrors inclined to the front\r\nof the instrument at angles of 45°, so that in each of them the observer\r\nsees only the design which belongs to it. The rays reach the eyes as if\r\nthey came from images placed in front of the observer; and the two\r\nimages having the proper differences, produce together the impression of\r\nsolid objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 244.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBrewster’s stereoscope—which is far more widely known than\r\nWheatstone’s—has two acute prisms, or, more usually, two portions of a\r\nconvex lens are cut out, and placed with their margins or thin parts\r\ninwards, and they thus produce the same effect as would be obtained by\r\ncombinations of a prism with a convex lens. Another very common form of\r\nthe stereoscope has merely two convex lenses. The effect of the convex\r\nlenses is to increase the apparent size of the images by diminishing the\r\ndivergence of the rays emitted by each point, producing the appearance\r\nof larger designs seen at a greater distance. The effect of the prism is\r\nto give the rays the direction which they would have if they proceeded\r\nfrom an object placed in a position immediately between the two designs,\r\nand an additional element by which we estimate distance, namely, the\r\nconvergence of the optic axes, is made to aid in the illusion, when the\r\nrays proceeding from the two different pictures have approximately the\r\ninclination that they would have if they emanated from real objects at\r\nthe place where the image is apparently formed. The box or case in which\r\nthe lenses or lenticular prisms are placed takes various forms. One of\r\nthe most common is represented in Fig. 244, but the stand on which it is\r\nmounted is not a necessary part of the instrument, although it is\r\nsometimes convenient. A handsome form is met with as a square case,\r\nenclosing a number of photographic stereoscopic views mounted on an\r\nendless chain in such a manner that they are brought successively into\r\nview by turning a knob on the outside. When an instrument of this kind\r\nis fitted up with a series of the beautiful landscape transparencies,\r\nwhich are produced by certain continental photographers, a more perfect\r\nreproduction of the impressions derived from nature, exclusive of\r\ncolour, cannot be conceived. We seem to be present on the very spots\r\nwhich are so truthfully depicted by the subtile pencil of the sunbeam;\r\nwe feel that we have but to advance a foot in order to mix with the\r\npassengers in the streets of Paris or of Rome, and that a single step\r\nwill bring us on the mountain-side, or place us on the slippery glacier;\r\nat our own fireside we can feel the forty centuries looking down upon us\r\nfrom the heights of those grand Egyptian pyramids, and find ourselves\r\nbodily confronted with the mysterious Sphinx, still asking the solution\r\nof her enigma. The truth and force with which these stereoscopic\r\nphotographs reproduce the relief of buildings are such, that when one\r\nsees for the first time the real edifice of which he has once examined\r\nthe stereoscopic images, it no longer strikes him as new or unknown; for\r\nhe derives from the actual scene no impression of form that he has not\r\nalready received from the image.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 245.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut of all subjects of stereoscopic photography the glaciers are,\r\nperhaps, those which best show the power of the instrument as far\r\nsurpassing all other resources of graphic presentation. The most careful\r\npainting fails to convey a notion of the strange glimmer of light which\r\nfills the clefts of the ice, seen through the transparent substance\r\nitself. The simple photograph commonly presents nothing but a confused\r\nmass of grey patches; but combine in the stereoscope two such\r\nphotographs, each formed of nothing but slightly different grey patches,\r\nand a surprising effect is at once produced: the masses of ice assume a\r\npalpable form, and the beautiful effects of light transmitted or\r\nreflected by the translucent solid reveal themselves. Another very\r\nbeautiful class of subjects for stereoscopic slides is found in those\r\nmarvellous instantaneous photographs, which seize and fix the images of\r\nthe waves as they dash upon the shore. Here a scene which has tasked the\r\npower of the greatest painter is brought home to us with such force and\r\nvividness that we all but hear the wild uproar of the breakers.\r\n\r\nBut for the art of photography the stereoscope would not thus be ready\r\nto minister to our enjoyment, for no pictures wrought by man’s handiwork\r\ncould approach the requisite accuracy which the two stereoscopic\r\npictures must possess. All attempts to produce such pictures by\r\nengraving or lithography have failed, except only in the case of linear\r\ngeometrical designs, such as representations of crystals. A very useful\r\nand suggestive application of the stereoscope has been made to the\r\nillustration of a treatise on _solid geometry_, where the lines\r\nrepresenting the planes, being drawn in proper perspective, the reader\r\nby placing a simple stereoscope over the plates sees the planes stand\r\nout in relief before him, and the multitude of lines, angles, &c., which\r\nin a simple drawing might be distracting even for a practised\r\ngeometrician, assume a clear and definite form. The difference between\r\nthe two retinal pictures of objects is so slight, that when the objects\r\nare at a little distance, ordinary observation fails to discover it\r\nwithout the aid of special instruments; and an inspection of the pair of\r\nphotographs in a stereoscopic slide will convince any one that, even in\r\nthese, close and careful observation is required to perceive the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nSome of the principles of stereoscopic drawings may be seen exemplified\r\nby the pair we give in Fig. 245. With this figure the reader may attempt\r\nthe experiment of seeing the stereoscopic effect without the\r\nstereoscope. When he has succeeded in doing this, or when he fuses the\r\nimages together by placing a simple stereoscope over the page, he will\r\nfind the result very singular; for he will receive the impression of a\r\nsolid crystal of some dark polished substance—black lead, for\r\ninstance—placed on a surface of the same material. The edges of the\r\nsolid will appear to have a certain lustre, such as one sees on the\r\nedges of a real crystal. The reason of this impression being produced by\r\ntwo drawings, one of which is formed by black lines on a white ground,\r\nwhile the other has white lines on a black ground, is probably due to\r\nthe circumstance that we very often see in nature the _lustrous_ edges\r\nof an object with one eye only. That is, one eye is in the path of the\r\nrays which are regularly reflected from the object, while the other is\r\nnot,—a fact which may be verified in an instant by looking first with\r\none eye and then with the other, at a polished pencil, or similar\r\nobject, when placed in a certain position.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of modification of the reflecting stereoscope, known\r\nunder the name of the _pseudoscope_, which is highly instructive, as\r\nshowing how much our notions of the solidity of objects are due to the\r\ndifferences of the retinal images. In the pseudoscope the rays reach the\r\neyes after passing through rectangular prisms in such a manner that\r\nobjects on the right appear on the left, and objects on the left appear\r\non the right; but the images agree by reason of the symmetry of the\r\nreflection, although the image of the objects that without the\r\ninstrument would be formed in the right eye is, by the action of the\r\nprisms, formed in the left eye, and _vice versâ_. The impressions\r\nproduced are very curious: convex bodies appear concave—a coin, for\r\nexample, seems to have the image hollowed out, a pencil appears a\r\ncylindrical cavity, a globe seems a concave hemisphere, and objects near\r\nat hand appear distant, and so on. These illusions are, however, easily\r\ndispelled by any circumstance which brings before the mind our knowledge\r\nof the actual forms, and by a mental effort it is possible to perceive\r\nthe actual forms even with the pseudoscope, and indeed to revert\r\nalternately, with the same object, from convexity to concavity. This\r\nlast effect is very curious, for the object appears to abruptly change\r\nits form, becoming alternately hollow and projecting, according as the\r\nmind dwells upon the one notion or the other; but the experiment is\r\nattended with a feeling of effort, which is very fatiguing to the eyes.\r\n\r\nProfessor Helmholtz has contrived another very curious instrument,\r\ndepending on the same principles as the stereoscope. He terms it the\r\n_telestereoscope_, and while the effect of the pseudoscope is to reverse\r\nthe relief of objects, the telestereoscope merely exaggerates this\r\nrelief; hence this instrument is well adapted for making those objects\r\nwhich from their distance present no stereoscopic effect, stand out in\r\nrelief. The distance between our eyes is not sufficiently great to give\r\nus sensibly different views of very distant objects, and what the\r\ntelestereoscope does is virtually to separate our eyes to a greater\r\ndistance. Fig. 246 is a horizontal section of the instrument. L and R\r\nrepresent the position of the eyes of the spectator; _a, b_, are two\r\nplane mirrors at 45° to his line of sight; A, B, are two larger plane\r\nmirrors, respectively nearly parallel to the former. _c d a_ L and _f g\r\nb_ R show the paths of rays from distant objects, and it is obvious that\r\nthe right eye will obtain a view of the objects identical with that\r\nwhich would be presented to an eye at R´, while the left eye has\r\nsimilarly the picture of the objects as seen from the point L´. The four\r\nmirrors are mounted in a box, and means are provided for adjusting the\r\npositions of the larger mirrors, as may be required. With this\r\ninstrument the distant objects in a landscape—a range of mountains, for\r\nexample—which present to the naked eye little or no appearance of\r\nrelief, have their projections and hollows revealed in the most curious\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 246.—_The Telestereoscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is upon a similar principle that stereoscopic views of some of the\r\ncelestial bodies have been obtained. Admirable stereoscopic slides of\r\nthe moon have been produced by photographing her at different times,\r\nwhen the illumination of the surface is the same, but when, in\r\nconsequence of her _libration_, somewhat different views of our\r\nsatellite are presented to us. Two such photographs, properly combined\r\nin the stereoscope, give not only the spherical form in full relief, but\r\nall the details of the surface: the mountains, craters, valleys, and\r\nplains are seen in their true relative projection.\r\n\r\nThe telestereoscope may be inverted, so to speak, and its effect\r\nreversed; for an arrangement of mirrors similarly disposed, but on such\r\na scale as will permit the eyes to be respectively in the lines _c d_\r\nand _f g_, would reflect from objects in the direction L R rays which\r\nwould have but little of the difference of direction to which the\r\nstereoscopic effect is due. Hence solid objects viewed with such an\r\ninstrument appear exactly like flat pictures, the effect being far more\r\nmarked than in simply viewing them with one eye.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious method of exhibiting a stereoscopic effect to an audience\r\nhas been contrived by Rollmann. He draws on a black ground two linear\r\nstereoscopic designs—that for the left eye with red lines, that for the\r\nright eye with blue. Each individual in the audience is provided with a\r\npiece of blue glass and a piece of red: he places the red glass before\r\nthe left eye, the blue glass before the right: each eye thus receives\r\nonly the picture intended for it, for the blue lines cannot be seen\r\nthrough the red glass, or the red lines through the blue glass. The\r\ndiagrams may, of course, be projected on a screen by a magic lantern, in\r\nwhich case the circumstances are even more favourable. Duboscq has\r\narranged a kind of opera-glass, so that a person may view appropriate\r\ndesigns on the large scale, and arrangements have been also contrived by\r\nwhich the stereoscopic effect may be seen in moving figures.\r\n\r\nEvery student of this interesting subject should examine a few\r\nstereoscopic images produced by simple lines representing geometrical\r\nfigures, or the photographs of the model of a crystal, as these exhibit\r\nin the most striking manner the conditions requisite for the production\r\nof stereoscopic effects. A person having a little skill in perspective\r\nand geometry might construct the two stereoscopic images of a body\r\ndefined by straight lines, but the drawings must be executed with\r\nextreme exactitude, for the least deviation would produce the most\r\nmarked effect in the stereoscopic appearance. The production of\r\nstereoscopic photographs now forms a considerable branch of industrial\r\nart. At first, these photographs were made by taking the two different\r\nviews with the same camera at two operations. But there were\r\ndifficulties in obtaining uniformity of depth in the impressions, and\r\nthe change in the shadows produced by the earth’s rotation showed\r\nitself—although the interval between the two exposures might not exceed\r\nthree or four minutes. The increased shadows in such cases show\r\nthemselves in the stereoscope, like dark screens suspended in the air.\r\nIt was Sir David Brewster who, in 1849, first proposed the plan now\r\nuniversally adopted, of producing the views simultaneously by twin\r\ncameras forming their images on different parts of the same sensitive\r\nplate, the centres of the lenses being placed at the same distance apart\r\nas a man’s eyes, that is, from 2½ to 3 in. This is, of course, the only\r\nmanner in which instantaneous views can be secured. Helmholtz, however,\r\nadvocates the photographs of remote objects being taken at a much\r\ngreater distance apart, for they otherwise present little appearance of\r\nrelief. By selecting from an assortment of slides, two views of the\r\nWetterhorn, taken from different points in the Grindelwald valley, and\r\ncombining these in the stereoscope, he found that a far more distinct\r\nidea of the modelling of the mountain could be thus obtained than even a\r\nspectator of the actual scene would receive by viewing the mountain from\r\nany one point. Such a mode of combining the photographs would produce in\r\nthe stereoscope the same effect as the telestereoscope would in the\r\nlandscape, but the effect would be caused to a proportionately far\r\nhigher degree.\r\n\r\nThe date of Wheatstone’s first publication regarding the stereoscope was\r\n1833; but a complete description and theory of the instrument was not\r\npublished until five years afterwards. Brewster first made public, in\r\n1843, his invention of the stereoscope with lenses, which is now so\r\nfamiliar to us, and few scientific instruments have become so quickly\r\nand extensively popular; certainly no other simple and inexpensive\r\ninstrument has contributed so largely to the amusement and instruction\r\nof our domestic circles. And, to the philosopher who studies the nature\r\nof our perceptions, the stereoscope has been even more instructive, for,\r\ninstead of vague surmises, it provided him with the solid ground of\r\nexperiment on which to found his theories. The literature of this one\r\nsubject—stereoscopic effect—is extensive enough to occupy a tolerably\r\nlong book-shelf. It dates from 300 B.C., when Euclid touched upon the\r\nsubject in his Optics; and after a lapse of more than eighteen centuries\r\nit was taken up by Baptista Porta, in 1583; but the whole development of\r\nthis subject belongs almost entirely to the last half-century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 247.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe part which the muscles of the eyes take in our perceptions of form\r\nhas been already alluded to, and it may be interesting to illustrate\r\nthis point by a curious example or two of illusions arising from their\r\nmovements. If our reader will glance at Fig. 247, he will see that the\r\nlines, _a b_ and _c d_, appear to be farther apart towards the centre\r\nthan at the ends, while _f g_ and _h i_, on the other hand, appear\r\nnearest together in the middle. He will hardly be convinced that in each\r\ncase the lines are quite parallel until he has actually measured the\r\ndistances. A still more striking example of the same kind of illusion is\r\nshown by Fig. 248, due to Zöllner. This appears a sort of pattern, in\r\nwhich the broad bands are not upright, but sloping alternately to the\r\nright and left, and with the spaces between the lines wider at one end\r\nthan the other. The lines in the figure are, however, strictly parallel.\r\nThe illusion by which they appear divergent and convergent is still more\r\nstrongly felt when the book is held so that the wider bands are inclined\r\nat an angle of 45° to the horizon. There is another illusion here with\r\nreference to the short lines, which will appear to be opposite to the\r\nwhite spaces on the other side of the long lines to which they are\r\nattached. That these illusions are really due to movements of the eyes\r\nmay be proved by viewing the designs in any manner which entirely\r\nprevents the movement, as by fixing the gaze on one spot in the case of\r\nFig. 247, when the illusion will vanish; but this plan is not so easily\r\napplied to Fig. 248. A convincing proof, however, will be found in the\r\nappearance of these figures when they are viewed by the instantaneous\r\nlight of the electric spark, as when a Leyden jar is discharged in a\r\ndark room. The reader viewing the figures, held near the place where the\r\nspark appears, will see them distinctly without the illusions as to the\r\nnon-parallelism of the lines. In the absence of an electrical machine,\r\nor coil and jar, the reader may have an opportunity of seeing the\r\nfigures by flashes of lightning at night, when the result will be the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 248.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere is a property of the eye which has led to the production of many\r\namusing and curious illusions. This property in itself is no new\r\ndiscovery, for its presence and effects must have been noticed ages ago.\r\nThe property in question is illustrated when we twirl round a stick or\r\ncord, burning with a red glow at the end. We seem to trace a _circle_ of\r\nfire; but as the glowing spark cannot be in more than one point of the\r\ncircle at once, it is plain that the impression produced on the eye must\r\nremain until the spark has completed its journey round the circle, and\r\nreaching each point successively renews the luminous impression. Like\r\nother subjects relating to vision, this phenomenon has been carefully\r\nexamined in recent times, and its laws accurately determined.\r\n\r\nThe fact which is obvious from such an experiment, may be thus stated:\r\nVisual impressions repeated with sufficient rapidity produce the effect\r\nof objects continually present. This persistence of the visual\r\nimpressions is easily made the subject of experiment by means of rapidly\r\nrotating discs; and in the common toy called a “colour top” we have a\r\nready means of verifying some of the conclusions of science on this\r\nsubject. Some very interesting results may be obtained by an apparatus\r\nas simple as this, regarding the laws of the phenomenon we are\r\nconsidering, and the effects of various mixtures of tints and colours.\r\nThe well-known toy, the thaumatrope, depends on the same principle. In\r\nthis a piece of cardboard is painted on one side, with a bird, for\r\nexample, and on the other side with a cage: when the cardboard is\r\ntwirled round very rapidly by means of a cord fixed at opposite points\r\nof its length, both bird and cage become visible at once, and the bird\r\nappears in the cage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 249.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 250.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 251.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA still more ingenious application of this principle we owe to Plateau,\r\nwho described it in 1833, under the title of the _phenakistiscope_; and\r\nalso to Stampfer, who independently devised the same arrangement about\r\nthe same time, and named it the _stroboscopic disc_. The reader may, at\r\nalmost any toy-shop, purchase one of them, provided with a number of\r\namusing figures; or he may easily construct for himself one which will\r\nexemplify the principle. He requires no other materials than a piece of\r\ncardboard, and his only tools may be a sharp penknife, a pair of\r\ncompasses, and a flat ruler. Let him draw on his cardboard a circle of 8\r\nin. diameter, and divide its circumference by eight equidistant points.\r\nFrom these radii should be drawn with the point of the compasses, and\r\nequal distances from the centre marked off upon them, to fix the centres\r\nof the small circles, which must all have exactly the same size (say, 1\r\nin. in diameter) and be marked by a distinct line. In these are to be\r\nmarked the hand of a clock-face in the positions shown in Fig. 249; and\r\nfinally, in the direction of the radii, narrow slips are to be cut out\r\nof the cardboard as shown. If a pin be put through the centre of the\r\ndisc, attaching it thus to the flat end of a cork, so that it can freely\r\nrotate in its own plane, and the disc be turned rapidly round, as in\r\nFig. 250, in front of a looking-glass, while the spectator looks through\r\nthe slits, he will see the hand on the little dial apparently turning\r\nround, with rather a jerky movement it is true, somewhat like the\r\ndead-beat seconds-hand that is sometimes seen on clocks. The illusion is\r\nbest when the slits are so narrow that only one of the several images is\r\nvisible by reflection, namely, that which is adjacent to the slit. Thus,\r\nas the disc rotates, each little circle is visible for an instant as the\r\nslit passes in front of the spectator’s eye; and if the rotation be\r\nsufficiently rapid, the impression of the disc is permanent, as it is\r\nconstantly being renewed by the successive circles, while, on the\r\ncontrary, the hands, having different positions, produce images in\r\ndifferent positions, giving the appearance of a jerky rotation. The\r\ninstruments sold in the shops have sometimes a thin metallic disc with\r\nthe slits in it, and a series of designs printed in smaller paper discs.\r\nThe paper discs may be screwed on the other disc as required, and a\r\nbutton on a pulley with an endless band is provided for producing the\r\nrotation more conveniently. Fig. 251 shows one of the pictures for a\r\ndisc with twelve slits, and the effect produced by it is that of a\r\ndancing figure.\r\n\r\nAnother arrangement for showing the same illusion has lately become a\r\nvery popular toy, and quite deservedly so, for it has the advantages of\r\nrequiring no looking-glass, and of making the effect visible to a number\r\nof persons at the same time. This apparatus, which has been termed the\r\nZoetrope, consists simply of a cylindrical box, like a drum with the\r\nupper end cut off. It is mounted on a pivot, which permits its revolving\r\nrapidly about its vertical axis when touched by the finger. The cylinder\r\nhas a number of equidistant vertical slits round the upper part of its\r\ncircumference. The figures which produce the illusion are printed on a\r\nslip of paper, which is placed in the lower part of the drum, and when\r\nthis is in rapid rotation, and the figures are viewed through the slits,\r\nthe illusion is produced in exactly the same manner as in the revolving\r\ndisc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 251_a_.—_Edison’s Kinetographic Theatre._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the article on the phonograph in a subsequent page, the\r\nreader will find a remark as to the effect that might be produced by a\r\ncombination of that instrument with instantaneous and simultaneous\r\nphotographs of some famous speaker. This combination has now been\r\naccomplished by the great inventive genius to whom we are indebted for\r\nthe phonograph. Mr. Edison has done this so effectively that he may be\r\nsaid to have given life to the _zoetrope_ by the perfection in which the\r\nocular illusion is produced together with the audible manifestations\r\nthat keep time with it. The amount of thought and ingenuity expended on\r\nthis new contrivance, which Edison has called the _kinetoscope_, will\r\nscarcely be appreciated by anyone who has not given some consideration\r\nto the many practical difficulties that have been overcome. No wonder\r\nthat the announcement made at the beginning of 1892 should have been\r\nreceived with incredulity, for it was to the effect that Edison had\r\ncontrived some happy combination of photography and electricity by which\r\na man (presumably one who could afford to pay for luxuries) might sit in\r\nhis own room and see the moving forms of the actors in an opera\r\nprojected on a screen before his eyes, while at the same time he would\r\nhear their voices singing. Every movement, every change of expression,\r\nevery glance of the eye, and, in fact, all that was visible to the\r\nspectator in front of the stage would appear on the screen, while not a\r\nnote of vocalist, or chord of orchestra, would fail to reach the ear.\r\nAnd all this was to be evoked at will, and repeated as often as desired,\r\nnot, therefore, of course, as a presentation of what was taking place at\r\nthe time, but as a reproduction of some previous performance. This\r\nwonderful result has virtually been attained by the application of\r\ndelicate and ingenious machinery designed to make the phonograph and the\r\ncamera work synchronously. The first part of the problem was the\r\nproduction of a succession of so-called instantaneous photographs at an\r\nextremely rapid rate. In the actual apparatus forty-six photographs are\r\ntaken every second, a feat which would beforehand be thought\r\nimpracticable. This is accomplished by making use of a band of sensitive\r\ncelluloid film, which alone admits of being moved and stopped with the\r\ndesired rapidity. The movement is imparted by an electric motor, and the\r\narrangement is such that for each exposure the film is held stationary\r\nfor 9/10ths of 1/46th of a second, during which the lens is uncovered,\r\nthen for the remaining ⅒th it is covered, while at the same time the\r\nfilm is jerked forward so as to expose a fresh surface to receive a new\r\nimpression. Obviously the mass moved and stopped with this rapidity\r\n(which without the stoppages is at the rate of 26 miles an hour) must be\r\nsmall, and it is found that photographs about 1 in. in diameter cannot\r\nbe much exceeded in view of this condition. The lens has to be entirely\r\nstopped or screened during the tenth of the short interval (1/460th of a\r\nsecond) in which the onward movement of the film is taking place, and it\r\nhas to be practically open during the remaining 9/10ths of the interval\r\n(9/460ths of one second) in which the film is held stationary in order\r\nto receive the photographic image. These alternations of movement and\r\nstoppage must take place with the utmost regularity, and Edison has used\r\na beautifully regulated electro-motor as the active power, which also\r\nsimultaneously moves a phonograph so that sights and sounds shall\r\nproceed in step, for it is thus they have to be reproduced. This is done\r\nby developing the band of film, and from it printing photographic\r\n_positives_ on a similar band, whose images are successively projected\r\non a screen by means of a lantern with a step by step movement, exactly\r\nthe same as that by which the original photographs are taken, while the\r\nphonographic cylinder is so timed as to give off to a loud-speaking\r\ninstrument the sounds that accompanied the photographs. A description of\r\nthe ingenious mechanism by which all this is accomplished is not\r\nsuitable for these pages, for it is the result, rather than the details\r\nof apparatuses, that interest the general reader. In a simpler form of\r\nkinetoscope the positive images on the band of film are viewed directly\r\nby single observers, each looking through magnifying glasses; in this a\r\ndisc with 46 slits revolves, and in its passage, as each slit\r\nmomentarily permits a view of the image, an electric flash\r\nsimultaneously lights it up. The same principle is, of course, used in\r\nthe screen projections. From the very great number of impressions made\r\non the eye in one second, there is none of that jerky movement that is\r\nobservable in the older appliances. Mr. Edison has found it necessary to\r\nprovide a special stage, or rather small theatre, in which the actors of\r\nthe little dramas may be photographed with every advantage in the way of\r\nlighting, &c. Fig. 251_a_ shows this kinetographic theatre with the\r\nelectric camera in action. The subjects reproducible in the kinetoscope\r\ninclude the most rapid movements, such as quick dances, blacksmiths\r\nhammering on an anvil, &c., or incidents of ordinary life involving much\r\ngesture and change of facial expression, and nothing can be more amusing\r\nthan to see all these shown to the life by the images on the screen, or\r\nby the pictures viewed through the lens, especially if at the same time\r\nthe phonograph is made to emit the corresponding sounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 252.—_Portrait of Sir W. Thomson._[5]\r\n]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Now Lord Kelvin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout sixty years ago a popular book was published having for its theme\r\nthe advantages which would flow from the general diffusion of scientific\r\nknowledge. Great prominence was, of course, given to the utility of\r\nscience in its direct application to useful arts, and many scientific\r\ninventions conducing to the general well-being of society were duly\r\nenumerated. Under the head of electricity, however, the writer of that\r\nbook mentioned but few cases in which this mysterious agent aided in the\r\naccomplishment of any useful end. The meagre list he gives of the\r\ninstances in which he says “_even_ electricity and galvanism might be\r\nrendered subservient to the operations of art,” comprises only orreries\r\nand models of cornmills and pumps turned by electricity, the designed\r\nsplitting of a stone by lightning, and the suggestion of Davy that the\r\nupper sheathing of ships should be fastened with copper instead of iron\r\nnails, with a hint that the same principle might be extended in its\r\napplication. At the present day the applications of electricity are so\r\nnumerous and important, that even a brief account of them would more\r\nthan fill the present volume. Electricity is the moving power of the\r\nmost remarkable and distinguishing invention of the age—the telegraph;\r\nit is the energy employed for ingeniously measuring small intervals of\r\ntime in chronoscopes, for controlling time-pieces, and for firing mines\r\nand torpedoes; it is the handmaid of art in electro-plating and in the\r\nreproduction of engraved plates, blocks, letterpress, and metal work; it\r\nis the familiar spirit invoked by the chemist to effect marvellous\r\ntransformations, combinations, and decompositions; it is a therapeutic\r\nagent of the greatest value in the hands of the skilful physician. Such\r\nan extension of the practical applications of electricity as we have\r\nindicated implies a corresponding development of the science itself;\r\nand, indeed, the history of electricity during the present century is a\r\ncontinuous record of brilliant discoveries made by men of rare and\r\ncommanding genius—such as Davy, Ampère, and Faraday. To give a complete\r\naccount of these discoveries would be to write a treatise on the\r\nscience; and although the subject is extremely attractive, we must pass\r\nover many discoveries which have a high scientific interest, and present\r\nto the reader so much of this recently developed science as will enable\r\nhim to comprehend the principles of a few of its more striking\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThe science of electricity presents some features which mark it with\r\nspecial characters as distinguished from other branches of knowledge. In\r\nmechanics and pneumatics and acoustics we have little difficulty in\r\npicturing in our minds the nature of the actions which are concerned in\r\nthe phenomena. We can also extend ideas derived from ordinary experience\r\nto embrace the more recondite operations to which heat and light may be\r\ndue, and, by conceptions of vibrating particles and undulatory ether,\r\nobtain a mental grasp of these subtile agents. But with regard to\r\nelectricity no such conceptions have yet been framed—no hypothesis has\r\nyet been advanced which satisfactorily explains the inner nature of\r\nelectrical action, or gives us a mental picture of any pulsations,\r\nrotations, or other motions of particles, material or ethereal, that may\r\nrepresent all the phenomena. Incapable as we are of framing a distinct\r\nconception of the real nature of electricity, there are few natural\r\nagents with whose ways we are so well acquainted as electricity. The\r\n_laws_ of its action are as well known as those of gravitation, and they\r\nare far better known than those which govern chemical phenomena or the\r\nstill more complex processes of organic life.\r\n\r\nDefinite as are the laws of electricity, there is no branch of natural\r\nor physical science on which the ideas of people in general are so\r\nvague. Spectators of the effects of this wonderful energy—as seen\r\nviolently and destructively in the thunderstorm, and silently and\r\nharmlessly in the Aurora—knowing vaguely something of its powers in\r\ntraversing the densest materials, in giving convulsive shocks, and in\r\naffecting substances of all kinds—the multitude regard electricity with\r\na certain awe, and are always ready to attribute to its agency any\r\neffect which appears mysterious or inexplicable. The popular ignorance\r\non this subject is largely taken advantage of by impostors and\r\ncharlatans of every kind. Electric and magnetic nostrums of every form,\r\nelectric elixirs, galvanic hair-washes, magnetized flannels, polarized\r\ntooth-brushes, and voltaic nightcaps appear to find a ready sale, which\r\nspeaks unmistakably of the less than half-knowledge which is possessed\r\nby the public concerning even the elements of electrical science.\r\n\r\nElectricity has also a special position with regard to its intimate\r\nconnection with almost every other form of natural energy. Evolved by\r\nmechanical actions, by heat, by movements of magnets, and by chemical\r\nactions, it is capable in its turn of reproducing any of these. It plays\r\nan important, but as yet an undefined, part in the physiological actions\r\nconstantly going on in the organized body, and is, in fact,\r\nall-pervading in its influence over all matter, organic and inorganic—a\r\nsecret power strangely but universally concerned in all the operations\r\nof nature. We are compelled to regard electricity not as a kind of force\r\nacting upon otherwise inert matter, but rather as an affection or\r\ncondition of which every kind of matter is capable, although we are\r\nstill unable to form a conjecture of the precise nature of the action.\r\n\r\nWe have now to address ourselves to the task of unfolding so much of the\r\nscience as will enable the reader to understand the leading principles\r\nof such important applications as electro-plating, illumination, and the\r\ntelegraph; and this will necessarily include an account of the grand\r\ndiscovery of the identity, or at least intimate connection, of magnetism\r\nand electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _ELEMENTARY PHENOMENA OF MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY._\r\n\r\nThe distinctive property of a magnet is, as everybody knows, to attract\r\npieces of iron, and this property having been observed by the ancients\r\nin a certain ore of iron which was found near the city of Magnesia, in\r\nAsia Minor, the property itself came to be called Magnetism. A bar of\r\nsteel, if rubbed with the natural magnet or loadstone, acquires the same\r\nproperty, and if the bar be suspended horizontally or poised on a pivot,\r\nit will settle only in one definite direction, which in this country is\r\nnearly north and south. If a narrow magnetized bar be plunged into iron\r\nfilings, it will be found that these are attracted chiefly by the ends\r\nof the bar, and not at all by the centre. It appears as if the magnetic\r\npower were concentrated in the extremities of the bar, and these are\r\ntermed its poles, the pole at the end of the bar which points to the\r\nnorth is called the _north pole_ of the magnet, and the other is named\r\nthe _south pole_. If a north pole of one magnet be presented to the\r\nnorth pole of another, they will repel each other, and the same\r\nrepulsion will take place between the south poles, whereas the north\r\npole of one magnet attracts the south pole of another. In other words,\r\npoles of the same name repel each other, but poles of opposite names\r\nattract each other, or still more concisely, _like poles repel, unlike\r\npoles attract each other_.\r\n\r\nMagnetism acts through intervening non-magnetic matter with undiminished\r\nenergy. Thus, the attractions and repulsions of magnetic poles manifest\r\nthemselves just as strongly when the poles are separated by a stratum of\r\nwood or stone as when merely air intervenes, and the attraction of small\r\npieces of iron by a magnet takes place through the interposed palm of\r\none’s hand without diminution. A delicately suspended needle in even a\r\nremote apartment of a large building moves whenever a cart passes in the\r\nstreet. It is almost too well known to require mention here, that iron\r\nand steel are the only common substances which are capable of plainly\r\nexhibiting magnetic forces, and, indeed, there are no known substances\r\ncapable of so powerful a magnetization as these. But the difference in\r\nthe magnetic behaviour of iron and steel is not so well understood, and\r\nit is a point of importance for our subject, and connected with a\r\nfundamental law which governs all magnetic manifestations. A piece of\r\npure iron is very readily cut with a file, whereas a piece of steel may\r\nbe so hard that the file makes no impression upon it whatever; and hence\r\na piece of pure iron, or rather iron holding no carbon in combination,\r\nand possessed of no steely quality, is often spoken of as _soft iron_.\r\nWhen a piece of soft iron is placed near the pole of a magnet, the iron\r\nbecomes, for the time, a magnet. If iron filings be sprinkled over it,\r\nthey will arrange themselves about the parts of the iron respectively\r\nnearest and farthest from the magnet, thus showing that the piece of\r\nsoft iron has acquired magnetic poles. It will be found on examining\r\nthese poles that the one nearest the magnet is of the contrary name to\r\nthe pole of the magnet, and the farthest is of the same name. The\r\nconversion of the soft iron into a magnet by the influence of a magnetic\r\npole is termed _induction_. It need hardly be said that the inductive\r\neffect is more powerful in proportion to the shortness of the distance\r\nseparating the piece of soft iron from the magnetic pole, and, of\r\ncourse, the effect is at its maximum when there is actual contact.\r\nInduction thus explains, by aid of the law of the poles, the attraction\r\nwhich a magnet exercises over pieces of iron, for it is plain that the\r\ninductive influence is accompanied by attraction between the two\r\ncontiguous oppositely-named poles of the magnet, and of the piece of\r\niron. But attraction is not the only force, for the pole developed at\r\nthe farthest portion of the piece of iron being of the same name as the\r\ninducing pole, these will be mutually repulsive. The attractive force\r\nwill, however, be more powerful on account of the shorter distance at\r\nwhich it is exerted, and will predominate over the repulsive force,\r\nparticularly at short distances, because then the difference will be\r\nrelatively greater. At distances from the inducing pole relatively great\r\nto the distance between the two poles of the piece of iron, the\r\ndifference may be so small that its effect in attracting the piece of\r\nsoft iron will be imperceptible, and then the piece of iron acted on by\r\ntwo (nearly) equal parallel forces, will be subject to what is termed in\r\nmechanics a _couple_, the only effect of which is to turn the body into\r\nsuch a position that the opposing forces act along the same line. The\r\ndefinite direction assumed by a freely suspended needle may be explained\r\nby supposing that the earth itself is a magnet having a _south_ pole in\r\nthe _northern_ hemisphere, and a _north_ pole in the _southern_\r\nhemisphere, the line joining these poles being shorter than the axis of\r\nthe earth, and not quite coinciding with it in position; and the fact of\r\nthe needle being turned round but not bodily attracted is then easily\r\naccounted for, the attractive and repulsive forces being reduced to a\r\n_couple_ in the manner just explained.\r\n\r\nIf the attempt be made to turn a piece of steel into a magnet, by the\r\ninduction of a magnetic pole, the same results will be obtained as in\r\nthe case of soft iron, but in a much feebler degree, and with this\r\ndifference: the piece of steel does not lose its magnetism when the\r\ninducing magnet is withdrawn, whereas in the case of the soft iron every\r\ntrace of magnetism vanishes the instant the inducing pole is removed.\r\nAnd if the pole of the magnet be not only put in contact with one end of\r\nthe piece of steel, but rubbed on it, the piece will acquire permanent\r\nand powerful magnetism. Hence it will be noticed that a piece of soft\r\niron can by the mere approximation of a magnetic pole be converted in an\r\ninstant into a magnet, and by the removal of the magnet can as instantly\r\nbe deprived of its magnetism, and made to revert into its ordinary\r\ncondition; while steel is not so readily magnetized, but retains its\r\nmagnetism permanently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 253.—_A simple Electroscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe elementary phenomena of electricity are extremely simple and easy of\r\ndemonstration, and as the whole science rests upon inferences derived\r\nfrom these, the reader would do well to perform the following simple\r\nexperiments for himself. Apparatus is represented in Fig. 253, but the\r\nonly essential portion is a straw, B, suspended from any convenient\r\nsupport by a very fine filament of _white silk_. To one or both ends of\r\nthe straw a little disc of gilt paper, or a small ball of elder-pith or\r\nof cork, should be attached, so that the straw may be balanced\r\nhorizontally. Now rub on a piece of woollen cloth a bit of sealing-wax,\r\nor a stick of sulphur, or a piece of amber, or a penholder, paper-knife,\r\nor comb made of ebonite, and immediately present the substance to the\r\nball at the end of the straw. It will be first attracted to the rubbed\r\nsurface, but after coming into contact with it, repulsion will be\r\nmanifested and the ball will separate, and may be chased round the\r\ncircle by following it with the excited body. The attraction of light\r\nbodies by amber after it has been rubbed appears to be the one solitary\r\nelectrical observation recorded by the ancients, but it has given its\r\nname to the science, ελεκτρον being the Greek name for amber. The cause,\r\nthen, of this property is named _electricity_, and bodies which exhibit\r\nit are said to be _electrified_. The reader will remark that these words\r\n_explain_ nothing: they are used merely to _express_ a certain state of\r\nmatter and the entirely unknown cause of that state. Let the pith or\r\ncork ball at the end of the straw be again charged with electricity, by\r\nbringing it into contact with a piece of sealing-wax or ebonite which\r\nhas just been electrified by friction. In this condition it will, as we\r\nhave just seen, be repelled by the substance which charged it, and on\r\ntrial it will be found to be repelled also by all the substances we have\r\nnamed, after they have been excited by friction. But if, while still\r\ncharged with the electricity communicated to it by contact with\r\nsealing-wax, sulphur, ebonite, or amber, we present to it a warm and dry\r\nglass tube which has just been rubbed with dry silk, we shall find that\r\nthe ball will be strongly attracted. After contact with the glass,\r\nrepulsion will take place, and the ball will refuse again to come into\r\ncontact with the excited glass. In this condition, however, it will be\r\nimmediately attracted by rubbed sealing-wax or ebonite, and so on\r\nalternately: the ball when repelled by the wax is attracted by the\r\nglass, and when repelled by the glass is attracted by the wax.\r\n\r\nThese simple experiments prove that, whatever electricity may be, there\r\nare two kinds of it, or, at least, it manifests two opposite sets of\r\nforces. The electricity evolved by the friction of glass with silk was\r\nformerly called _vitreous_ electricity, and that shown by excited resin,\r\nsealing-wax, amber, &c., was named _resinous_ electricity. These names\r\nhave now been respectively replaced by the terms _positive_ and\r\n_negative_. It must be understood that these terms imply no actual\r\nexcess or defect, but are purely distinguishing terms, just as we speak\r\nof the _up_ and _down_ line of a railway, without implying an\r\ninclination in one direction or the other. A fact of great importance in\r\nelectrical theory is discovered when the substances in which electricity\r\nis developed are carefully examined: it is found that one kind is never\r\nproduced without the other simultaneously appearing. Thus, the silk\r\nwhich has been used for rubbing the glass in the above experiments will\r\nbe found to exhibit the same electricity as sealing-wax or ebonite. And,\r\nfurther, the _quantities_ of positive and negative electricity evolved\r\nare always found to be equal, or equivalent to each other; that is, if\r\nthey are put together they completely neutralize or destroy each other’s\r\neffects. We have used the word “quantity,” implying that electricity can\r\nbe measured. No doubt, whatever electricity may be, there may be more or\r\nless of it; but can we measure an imponderable, invisible, impalpable\r\nthing, incapable of isolation? What we really measure when we say that\r\nwe measure electricity is the attractive or repulsive force: we balance\r\nthis against some other force (that of gravitation, for example), and we\r\nsay, so much weight lifted represents so much electricity.\r\n\r\nIf we try to electrify a piece of metal by holding it in the hand and\r\nrubbing it against woollen cloth, silk, or other substance, we shall\r\nfail in the attempt: no signs of electricity will thus be shown by the\r\nmetal. Hence bodies were formerly divided into two classes—those which\r\ncould be electrified by friction, and those which could not. It was\r\nafterwards found, however, that there was no real ground for this\r\ndivision, but that, on the contrary, _no two bodies can be rubbed\r\ntogether, even if they are made of the same substances, without positive\r\nelectricity appearing in one, and an equivalent quantity of negative\r\nelectricity in the other_. The real difference between bodies which\r\nprevents the manifestation of electricity in many cases depends upon the\r\nfact that electricity is able to traverse some substances with great\r\nfacility, while others prevent its passage. Thus, if we suspend\r\nhorizontally a hempen cord by white silk attached to the ceiling, so\r\nthat the hempen cord comes in contact with nothing but the silk, we\r\nshall find, on presenting a piece of excited ebonite to one end of the\r\ncord, that electric attraction of light bodies will be manifested at the\r\nother. If a silk cord be substituted for the hempen one, no such effect\r\nwill be observed. The hemp is, therefore, said to be a _conductor_, and\r\nthe silk a _non-conductor_. Again, if we substitute for one of the silk\r\nthreads suspending the cord a piece of twine, or a wire, we shall fail\r\nto obtain any electric manifestations at the remote end, because the\r\nelectricity will be carried off into the earth by the conducting powers\r\nof these substances. On the other hand, filaments of glass or ebonite\r\nmay be used, instead of the silk, with the same effect: they do not\r\nallow the electricity to run through them to the ground, and are\r\ntherefore termed, like the silk, _insulators_ of electricity. The\r\ndistinction of bodies into conductors on the one hand, and into\r\nnon-conductors or insulators on the other, is of paramount importance in\r\nthe science and in all its applications. This distinction, however, is\r\nnot an absolute one: there is no substance so perfect an insulator that\r\nit will not permit any electricity to pass, and there is no conductor so\r\nperfect that it does not offer resistance to the passage. Substances may\r\nbe arranged in a list which presents a gradation from the best conductor\r\nto the best insulator. The metals are by far the best conductors, but\r\nthere is great relative diversity in their conductive power. Silver,\r\ncopper, and gold are much the best conductors among the metals, iron\r\noffering eight times, and quicksilver fifty times, the resistance of\r\nsilver. Coke, charcoal, aqueous solutions, water, vegetables, animals,\r\nand steam are all more or less conductors, while among the substances\r\ncalled insulators may be named, in order of increasing insulating power,\r\nindia-rubber, porcelain, leather, paper, wool, silk, mica, glass, wax,\r\nsulphur, resins, amber, gum-lac, gutta-percha, and ebonite. It will now\r\nbe obvious why the electricity developed by the friction of a piece of\r\nmetal fails to manifest itself under ordinary circumstances, as, for\r\ninstance, when held in the hand: the metal and the body being both\r\nconductors, the electricity escapes. But if the piece of metal be held\r\nby an insulating handle of glass or ebonite, the electrified condition\r\nmay easily be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _THEORY OF ELECTRICITY._\r\n\r\nThe few elementary facts which have been pointed out are absolutely\r\nnecessary for the foundation of what is sometimes termed the theory of\r\nelectricity, but which is properly no theory,—at least, not a theory in\r\nthe same sense as gravitation is a theory explaining the motions of the\r\nplanets, or even in the sense in which the hypothesis of the ether and\r\nits movements explains the phenomena of light. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary to have a conception of some kind which may serve to connect\r\nin our minds the various phenomena of electricity, if it were only to\r\nenable us the more easily to talk about them. In default of any\r\nsupposition which will shadow forth what actually occurs in these\r\nphenomena, we have recourse to what has been aptly termed _a\r\nrepresentative fiction_: we picture to ourselves the actions as due to\r\n_imaginary fluids_—fluids which we know _do not exist_, but are as much\r\ncreations of the mind as Macbeth’s air-drawn dagger; not, however, like\r\nhis “false creation,” proceeding from “the heat-oppressed brain,” but\r\nintellectual fictions, consciously and designedly adopted for the\r\npurpose of enabling us the better to think of the facts, to readily\r\nco-ordinate them, and to express them in simple and convenient language.\r\nNon-scientific persons hearing this language usually mistake its\r\npurport, and imagine that the actual existence of an “electric fluid” is\r\nacknowledged. The accounts which appear in the newspapers of the damage\r\ndone by thunderstorms are often amusing from the objectivity which the\r\nreporter attributes to the “electric fluid.” It is described, perhaps,\r\nas “entering the building,” “passing down the chimney,” then “proceeding\r\nacross the floor,” “rushing down the gas-pipes,” “forcing its way\r\nthrough a crevice, and then streaming down the wall,” &c., in terms\r\nwhich imply the utmost confidence of belief in the existence of the\r\n“fluid.” With this intimation that the hypothesis of electric fluids is\r\nmerely, then, a “_façon de parler_,” the reader will not be misled by\r\nthe following brief explanation of the elementary facts in the language\r\nof the theory.\r\n\r\nIn the natural state all bodies contain an indefinite quantity of an\r\nimponderable subtile matter, which may be called “neutral electric\r\nfluid.” This fluid is formed by a combination of two different kinds of\r\nparticles, positive and negative, which are present in equal quantities\r\nin bodies not electrified; but when there is in any body an excess of\r\none kind of particles, that body is charged accordingly with positive or\r\nnegative electricity. Both fluids traverse with the greatest rapidity\r\ncertain substances termed _conductors_; but they are retained amongst\r\nthe molecules of _insulating_ substances, which prevent their movement\r\nfrom point to point. When one body is rubbed against another, the\r\nneutral electric fluid is decomposed—the positive particles go to one\r\nbody, the negative with which these positive particles were before\r\nunited pass to the other body. The particles of the same name repel each\r\nother, but particles of opposite names attract each other; and it is\r\nthis attraction which is overcome when the electricities are separated\r\nby friction or in any other manner.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the above is nothing but the statement of the\r\nelementary facts in the language of the hypothesis. This system of the\r\ntwo fluids readily lends itself to the explanation of nearly all the\r\nphenomena presented in what is termed _static electricity_—that is, in\r\nthose phenomena where the actions are conceivably due to a more or less\r\npermanent separation of the fluids. The grand discoveries in electricity\r\nturn, however, upon quite another condition, namely, one in which the\r\ntwo hypothetical fluids must be imagined as constantly combining, and\r\nhere the utility of the hypothesis is less marked. Inasmuch, however, as\r\nthere can be no doubt regarding the identity of the agent operating in\r\nthe two sets of circumstances, the facts of _dynamical electricity_ must\r\nstill be expressed in the same language, with the aid of any additional\r\nconceptions which may give us more grasp of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _ELECTRIC INDUCTION._\r\n\r\nIn all electrical phenomena an inductive action occurs, which resembles\r\nthat which we have already indicated with regard to magnetism. Thus, if\r\nwe take an insulated metallic conductor in the uncharged state, and\r\nbring it near an electrified body, we shall find that the conductor,\r\nwhile still at a considerable distance, will give signs of an electrical\r\ncharge. Suppose we have a cylindrical conductor, and that we present one\r\nend of it to the electrified body, but at such a distance that no spark\r\nshall pass, we shall find, if the charge on the electrified body be\r\nstrong and the conductor be brought sufficiently near, that on bringing\r\nthe finger near the insulated cylinder, a spark passes. While the\r\ncylinder continues in the same position with regard to the electrified\r\nbody, no further sparks can be drawn from it; but if the distance\r\nbetween the two bodies be increased, the insulated cylinder will be\r\nfound to have another charge of electricity, which will again produce a\r\nspark. And by repeating these movements we may obtain as many sparks as\r\nwe desire by these mechanical actions, without in the least drawing upon\r\nthe charge on the original electrified body. The electrophorus is a\r\ndevice for obtaining electricity by this plan, and several rotatory\r\nelectrical machines have lately been invented which yield large supplies\r\nof electricity by a similar inductive action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 254.\r\n\r\n  _The Gold-leaf Electroscope._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is found that in such a case as that we have above supposed, if the\r\nelectrified body is charged with positive electricity, the uncharged\r\nconductor brought near it has its electricities separated—the negative\r\nattracted and held by the attraction of the positive charge in the parts\r\nof the cylinder nearest the inducing body; while the corresponding\r\nquantity of positive electricity is driven towards the most remote parts\r\nof the insulated conductor. It is this last which gives the spark in the\r\nfirst case, and if it be not thus withdrawn from the conductor, it\r\nre-combines with the negative electricity when the conductor is\r\nwithdrawn from the neighbourhood of the electrified body, and the\r\nconductor then reverts to the natural or unelectrified state. But the\r\ncontact of a conducting body with the conductor while it is under the\r\ninfluence of the electrified body withdraws only positive electricity,\r\nthe negative—being held, as it were, by the attraction of the positive\r\nelectricity of the charged body—is not thus removed, and in this\r\ncondition it is sometimes called _disguised_ or _dissimulated_\r\nelectricity—a term the propriety of which is doubtful. The excess of\r\nnegative “fluid” which the conductor thus acquires shows itself,\r\nhowever, only when the inducing body has been withdrawn. Precisely\r\nsimilar effects will take place, _mutatis mutandis_, if the electrified\r\nbody has a negative charge. A demonstration of inductive effects is\r\nreadily afforded in the action of the gold-leaf _electroscope_, Fig.\r\n254, in which two strips of gold-leaf are suspended within a glass case\r\nfrom wire passing through the top, and terminated in a metal plate. This\r\ninstrument is often used for showing the existence of very small\r\nelectric charges. Let a stick of sealing-wax be rubbed and held, say, a\r\nfoot or more from the plate of the electroscope, the leaves will diverge\r\nwith negative electricity. The sealing-wax being retained in the same\r\nposition, touch the plate for an instant with the finger. This will\r\nremove the negative charge, but the _positive_ electricity will be\r\nretained on the plate by the attraction of the negative of the\r\nsealing-wax. Now remove the sealing-wax, when the dissimulated charge\r\nwill spread itself over the whole insulated metallic portion of the\r\nelectroscope, and the leaves will diverge with a strong charge of\r\n_positive_ electricity. If an excited glass tube is brought near the\r\nelectroscope, the leaves will now diverge still more; if the sealing-wax\r\nis replaced in its former position, the leaves will collapse. In all\r\nthese cases the electrified body parts with none of its own electricity\r\nby developing electrical effects in the neighbouring bodies.\r\n\r\nThe inductive actions we have described take place through the air,\r\nwhich is a non-conductor, and such actions may be made to take place\r\nthrough any other non-conductor. With solid non-conductors, such as\r\nglass, gutta-percha, &c., the inducing body may be brought very near to\r\nthe conductor on which it is to act; for the intervening solid\r\nsubstance, or _dielectric_, as it has been appropriately called, opposes\r\na resistance to the combination of the opposite electricities, and the\r\ninductive effects are greatly intensified by the approximation. Faraday\r\ndiscovered that the amount of inductive action with a given charge is\r\nalso dependent upon the nature of the dielectric, and that the electric\r\nforces act upon the particles of the dielectric, circumstances which are\r\nof the greatest importance, as we shall presently find, in practical\r\ntelegraphy. The most familiar instance of induction is probably well\r\nknown to the reader in the Leyden jar, Fig. 255, which is simply a\r\nwide-mouthed bottle of thin glass, covered internally and externally\r\nwith tin-foil to within a few inches of the neck. The inner coating\r\ncommunicates by means of a rod and chain with a brass knob. Such a jar\r\nadmits of the accumulation of a larger quantity of electricity than the\r\nconductor of a machine will retain. A very few turns of the machine will\r\nsuffice usually to charge the conductor to the fullest extent; but if it\r\nbe put in communication with the knob of a jar, a great many more turns\r\nwill be required to attain the same charge in the conductor, and the\r\nexcess of electricity represented by these additional turns will have\r\naccumulated within the jar—an effect due to the “dissimulated”\r\nelectricity of its exterior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 255.—_The Leyden Jar._\r\n]\r\n\r\nEverybody knows the result when a metallic communication is established\r\nbetween the exterior and the interior of a charged Leyden jar. There is\r\na very bright spark, a snap, and the jar is “discharged.” Everybody\r\nknows, also, the sensation experienced when his body takes the place of\r\nthe metallic communication, or forms part of the circuit through which\r\nthe communication takes place. Everybody knows that the shock then felt\r\nmay also be experienced at the same moment by any number of persons who\r\njoin hands, under such conditions that they also form a part of the line\r\nof communication. Such facts irresistibly suggest the notion of\r\nsomething passing through the whole chain, and this notion is in perfect\r\nharmony with the hypothesis of the “fluids,” for we have only to suppose\r\nthat it is one or both of these which rush through the circuit the\r\ninstant the line of communication is complete. It was one of Franklin’s\r\ndiscoveries that the electrical charges of the Leyden jar do not reside\r\nin the metallic coatings; for he made a jar with removable inside and\r\noutside coatings, which, properly taken from the glass, showed no signs\r\nof electrification, yet when replaced the jar was found to be again\r\nhighly charged. This would seem to show that the charge clings to, or\r\npenetrates within, the glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _DYNAMICAL ELECTRICITY._\r\n\r\nLet us take a vessel containing water, to which some sulphuric acid has\r\nbeen added, Fig. 256, and in the liquid plunge a plate of copper, C, and\r\na plate of _pure_ zinc, Z, keeping the plates apart from each other. As\r\nit is not easy to obtain zinc perfectly free from admixture of other\r\nmetals, an artifice is commonly resorted to for obtaining a surface of\r\npure metal, by rubbing a plate of the ordinary metal with quicksilver,\r\nwhich readily dissolves pure zinc, but is without action on the iron and\r\nother metals with which the zinc is contaminated, while the quicksilver\r\nis not acted upon by the diluted acid, but is merely the vehicle by\r\nwhich the pure zinc is presented to the liquid. Under the conditions we\r\nhave described, no action will be perceived, no gas will be given off,\r\nnor will the zinc dissolve in the acid. If the electrical condition of\r\nthe portion of the copper-plate which is out of the liquid be examined\r\nby means of a _delicate_ electroscope, it will be found to possess a\r\nvery weak charge of _positive_ electricity, and a similar examination of\r\nthe zinc plate will show the existence on it of a feeble charge of\r\n_negative_ electricity. If the two plates be made to touch each other,\r\nor if a wire be attached to each plate, as shown in the figure, and the\r\nwires be brought into contact outside of the vessel, an action in the\r\nliquid is immediately perceptible at the surface of the _copper_ plate,\r\nwhen a multitude of small bubbles of hydrogen gas will at once make\r\ntheir appearance, and the gas will be given off continuously from the\r\ncopper plate so long as there is metallic contact through the wires, or\r\notherwise, between the two plates, or until the acid is saturated with\r\nzinc—for in this action the zinc is dissolving, and, in consequence,\r\nliberating hydrogen, which strangely makes its appearance, not at the\r\nplace where the chemical action really occurs, namely, at the surface of\r\nthe zinc which is in contact with the acid, but at the surface of the\r\ncopper which is not acted upon by the acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 256.—_A Voltaic Element._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is known that when we establish a metallic communication between two\r\nbodies charged with equivalent quantities of positive and negative\r\nelectricities respectively, these combine and neutralize each other, and\r\nall signs of electricity vanish. It is obvious that the contact of the\r\ntwo wires has this effect, as the signs of electric charge which were\r\nbefore discoverable in each of the plates are no longer found while the\r\nwires are in contact. But the charges reappear the instant the contact\r\nis broken, the chemical action ceasing at the same time. If the wire\r\nconnecting the two plates outside of the vessel be carefully examined,\r\nit will be found, so long as the chemical action is going on, to be\r\nendowed with new and very remarkable properties. If this wire be\r\nstretched horizontally over a freely suspended magnetic needle, and\r\nparallel to it, the needle will be deflected from its position, and, if\r\nthe wire be placed very near it, will point nearly east and west,\r\ninstead of north and south. Now, this effect is produced by any part\r\nwhatever of the wire, and it instantly ceases if the wire be cut at any\r\npoint. These facts at once suggest the idea of its being due to\r\nsomething flowing through the wire, so long as metallic continuity is\r\npreserved. This idea is much strengthened when we find that the action\r\nof the connecting wire upon the magnetic needle is quite definite—or, in\r\nother words, there are indications which correspond with the notion of\r\ndirection. For when the wire, which we shall still suppose to be\r\nstretched horizontally _above_ the needle and parallel to its direction,\r\nis so connected with the plates immersed in the acid that the portion\r\nwhich approaches the south-pointing pole of the needle proceeds from the\r\ncopper plate, while the portion above the north pole is in connection\r\nwith the zinc plate, then the north end of the needle will always be\r\ndeflected towards the west—whereas, if the connections be made in the\r\ncontrary manner, the deflection will be in the opposite direction; and\r\nif the wire be below the needle, the contrary deflections will be\r\nobserved with the same connections. The discovery of the action of such\r\na wire on the magnetic needle was made by Œrsted in 1819, and it is a\r\ndiscovery remarkable for the wonderful extent of the field which it\r\nopened out, both in the region of pure science and in that of practical\r\nutility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 257.—_Ampère’s Rule._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSince by such experiments as those just mentioned the notion of a\r\n_current_ is arrived at, the mind recurs to the fiction of the “fluids,”\r\nand pictures the “positive fluid” as rushing in one direction, and the\r\n“negative fluid” in the other, to seek a re-combination into “neutral\r\nfluid.” But we must never lose sight of the fact that these ideas are\r\nconsciously adopted as representative fictions to help our thoughts—just\r\nas John Doe and Richard Roe, imaginary parties to an imaginary lawsuit,\r\nused to be named in legal documents, in order to explain the nature of\r\nthe proceedings. Failing, then, to find anything really flowing along\r\nour wire, it is still absolutely necessary, seeing there is something\r\ndefinite in its action, to assign a direction to the supposed current;\r\nand it has been agreed that we shall represent the current as flowing\r\nfrom the positively charged body to the negatively charged body—that is,\r\nin the case we have been considering, from the copper to the zinc\r\nthrough the wire. When this conventional representation has been\r\nadopted, the action on a magnetic needle can easily be defined and\r\nremembered by an artifice proposed by Ampère. In Fig. 257, let N S\r\nrepresent the magnetized needle, N being the pole which points towards\r\nthe north, and S the south pole. Let C be the end of the wire connected\r\nwith the copper plate, and Z that connected with the zinc. The current\r\nis therefore supposed to flow in the direction indicated by the arrows\r\nin a wire above the needle and in the wire placed below. Now, suppose\r\nthat a man is swimming in the current in the same direction it is\r\nflowing, _and with his face towards the needle, then the north pole of\r\nthe needle will always be deflected towards his left_. With the\r\ndirection of current represented in the figure, the pole, N, will be\r\nthrown forward from the plane of the paper, or towards the spectator.\r\n\r\nThe reader who desires to study the mutual action of currents and\r\nmagnets will find it necessary to fix this idea in his mind. He will now\r\nbe able to see that if the wire be coiled round the needle, as shown by\r\nthe lines and arrows, Fig. 257, so that the same current may circulate\r\nin reverse directions above and below the magnet, its effects in\r\ndeviating the needle will everywhere concur—that is, the action of each\r\npart will be to turn the north pole towards the left. It is, therefore,\r\nplain that if the wire conveying the current be passed several times\r\nround the magnetic needle, the deflecting force will be increased; and a\r\ncurrent, which would, by merely passing above or below the magnet,\r\nproduce no marked deflection, might be made to produce a considerable\r\neffect if carried many times round it. The arrangement for this purpose\r\nis shown in Fig. 258, where it will be perceived that the needle is\r\nsurrounded by a coil of wire, so that the current circulates many times\r\nabout it, and the effects of each part of the circuit concur in\r\ndeflecting the needle. Such an arrangement of the wire and needle\r\nconstitutes what is called the _galvanometer_, an instrument used to\r\ndiscover the existence and direction of electric currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 258.—_Galvanometer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of metals and acid which we have described is termed a\r\n_voltaic couple_, _element_, or _cell_; and a great controversy has long\r\nbeen carried on among men of science as to the place at which the\r\ndevelopment of electricity has its origin. Three-quarters of a century\r\nago, the effect was attributed by Volta to the mere contact of the two\r\ndissimilar metals. In the experiment we have described this contact,\r\nsupposing the wires to be of copper, would occur at the junction of the\r\nwire and the zinc plate. Now, by joining the copper plate of such a cell\r\nto the zinc plate of another cell, the copper of that to the zinc of a\r\nthird, and so on, it is evident that the number of dissimilar contacts\r\nmight be indefinitely increased, and the electric power should be\r\nproportionately augmented. It is found that this is really the case, but\r\nVolta’s explanation has been opposed by another which regards the\r\nchemical action in the cells as the real origin of the electric\r\nmanifestations. This last explanation, supported by many apparently\r\nconclusive experiments of Faraday and others, has been generally\r\naccepted. Galvanic batteries—as a series of cells joined together in a\r\ncertain manner are termed—have been constructed, in which there is no\r\ncontact of dissimilar metals; and no electric _current_ can be obtained\r\nfrom an apparatus in which no chemical action takes place. The contact\r\ntheory in a modified form has recently been revived by Sir W. Thomson\r\nand others. In this it is now maintained that some _separation_ of\r\nelectricities really does take place by contact of dissimilar\r\n_substances_, but that a _current_ can be produced only when this\r\nseparation is continually renewed by chemical actions. Be the true\r\nexplanation what it may, the fact is undoubted that by joining cell to\r\ncell, we can really obtain vastly more powerful effects. If we take a\r\nsingle cell, such as that represented in Fig. 256, and connect the\r\nplates with a long and thin wire, we shall find that the current flowing\r\nthrough each part of the circuit is much weaker than when we connect the\r\nplates with a short and thick wire. In other words, the action in the\r\nlatter case, when the wire is stretched over a magnetic needle, will be\r\nmore powerful than in the former. By using a long and thin wire the\r\ncurrent may be so weakened that it becomes necessary to surround the\r\nneedle with many coils of the wire to produce a marked deflection.\r\nAgain, much depends upon the material; thus a copper wire conveys a much\r\nmore powerful current than a German silver one of the same dimensions.\r\nThere thus appears to be a certain analogy between the flow of\r\nelectricity along conductors to that of water through pipes. The longer\r\nand narrower are the pipes, the less is the quantity of water forced\r\nthrough them by a given head; and similarly, the resistance to the\r\npassage of a current increases with the length and narrowness of the\r\nconducting wire. When all other circumstances are the same, the\r\n_electrical resistance_ of a conductor varies directly as its length and\r\ninversely as its sectional area. Hence the current flowing in the\r\napparatus represented in Fig. 256 would be increased by making the wire\r\nthicker, and by making it shorter by bringing Z and C nearer together,\r\nand by making the area they expose to the liquid larger; for in the\r\nliquid also the current flows as indicated by the arrow, a fact which\r\nmay be proved by the deflection of a magnetized needle suspended above\r\nthe vessel. The magnitude of the current depends, then, upon two\r\nopposing forces, namely, that which continuously separates the\r\nelectricities, or drives them apart to re-combine through the circuit,\r\nand that which opposes their passage. The former, which is termed the\r\n_electromotive force_, originates, according to some, from the mere\r\ncontact of dissimilar materials, according to others from the chemical\r\naction. Now, we may increase the strength of the current in a given\r\narrangement, either by increasing the electromotive force, or by\r\ndiminishing the resistance. The increase of the strength of the current,\r\nproduced by merely pouring more acid into the vessel, Fig. 256, is due,\r\naccording to the chemical theory, to the former cause; according to the\r\ncontact theory, to the latter. By multiplying the cells we increase the\r\nelectromotive forces: the current receives, so to speak, an onward shove\r\nin each cell, but with each cell we introduce an additional resistance.\r\nHence, it follows, that when the resistance of the circuit outside of\r\nthe cells is extremely small, the current produced by a single cell is\r\nas powerful as that produced by a thousand. But when the external\r\nresistance is great, as when long thin wires are used, the united\r\nelectromotive forces of a number of cells are needed to drive the\r\ncurrent through the circuit. The strength of a current, C, is therefore\r\nexpressible by the following simple formula, in which _r_ stands for the\r\ninternal resistance, and _e_ for the electromotive force in each cell;\r\n_n_ represents the number of cells in the battery, these being supposed\r\nexactly similar in every respect; R is the sum of the resistances in the\r\ncircuit outside of the battery.\r\n\r\n                                    _ne_\r\n                              C = ————————\r\n                                  _nr_ + R\r\n\r\nIt is easily seen that the smaller R is made, the more nearly does the\r\nstrength of the current become independent of the number of cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 259.—_Daniell’s Cell and Battery._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 260.—_Grove’s Cell and Battery._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut many modifications have been made in the materials and form of the\r\ncells, by which greater power and duration of action have been attained.\r\nOur space permits a description of only two forms, and these must be\r\ndescribed without a discussion of the principles upon which their\r\nincreased efficiency depends. Daniell’s constant cell is represented in\r\nFig. 259, where D is a battery of ten such cells, A is a cylindrical\r\nvessel of copper, C is a tube of porous earthenware, closed at the\r\nbottom, and within it is suspended the solid rod of amalgamated zinc, B.\r\nThe copper vessel and the zinc rod are provided with screws by which\r\nwires may be attached. In the copper vessel is placed a saturated\r\nsolution of sulphate of copper, and some crystals of the same substance\r\nare placed on the perforated shelf within the vessel. The porous tube is\r\nfilled with diluted sulphuric acid. When the battery is in action the\r\nzinc is dissolved by the sulphuric acid, and metallic copper is\r\ncontinually deposited upon the internal surface of the copper vessel.\r\nDaniell’s battery, in some form or other, is much used for telegraphs\r\nand for electrotyping. Grove’s cell is shown in section in Fig. 260. The\r\nexternal vessel is made of a rectangular form in glazed earthenware or\r\nglass. It contains a thick plate of amalgamated zinc, A, A, bent\r\nupwards, and between the two portions a flat porous cell, C, C, is\r\nplaced, filled with strong nitric acid, in which is immersed a thin\r\nsheet of platinum. The outside vessel is charged with water, mixed with\r\nabout ⅛th of sulphuric acid. D represents a battery of four such cells,\r\nin which the mode of connecting the platinum of one to the zinc of the\r\nnext may be noticed. The terminal platinum and zinc form the _poles_ of\r\nthe battery, and to them the wires are attached which convey the\r\ncurrent. The substitution of plates of coke for the platinum gives the\r\nform of battery known as Bunsen’s, which is also sometimes made with\r\ncircular cells. Gover’s and Bunsen’s are much more powerful arrangements\r\nthan Daniell’s, but the latter has the advantage as regards the duration\r\nand uniformity of its action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 261.—_Wire ignited by electricity._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the current produced by a battery of a dozen or more such cells is\r\nconveyed by a wire, it is observed that this wire becomes sensibly hot,\r\nand, if the wire be thin enough, the heat may be sufficiently great to\r\nheat the wire to redness. By stretching a piece of platinum wire between\r\ntwo separate rods which convey the current, as represented in Fig. 261,\r\nthe length of wire through which the current passes may be adjusted so\r\nas to give any required amount of light, and the wire may even be heated\r\nto the fusing-point of platinum. This property of electricity has some\r\ninteresting applications, as, for example, in firing mines and other\r\nexplosive charges, and in some surgical operations. A still more\r\ninteresting exhibition of heating and luminous effects is observed when\r\nthe terminals of a battery of many cells are connected with two rods of\r\ncoke, or gas-retort carbon. When the pointed ends of the rods are\r\nbrought into contact, the current passes, and the points begin to glow\r\nwith an intensely bright light, and if they are then separated from each\r\nother by an interval of ⅒th of an inch or more, according to the power\r\nof the battery, a luminous arc extends between them, emitting so intense\r\na light that the unprotected eye can hardly support it. This luminous\r\narc is called the _voltaic arc_, and it excels all other artificial\r\nlights in brilliancy, a fact due to the extremely high temperature to\r\nwhich the carbon particles are heated, the temperature being, perhaps,\r\nthe highest we can attain. It must not be supposed that in this\r\nbrilliant light we see electricity: the light is due to the same cause\r\nas the light of a candle or gas flame, namely, incandescent particles of\r\nsolid carbon. These particles are carried from one carbon point to the\r\nother, and it is found that the positive pole rapidly loses its\r\nsubstance, which is partly deposited on the negative pole. But in order\r\nto obtain a steady light, it is requisite to keep the pieces of carbon\r\nat one invariable distance; and therefore the transference of the\r\nmaterial from one pole to the other, and the loss by combustion, must be\r\ncompensated by a slow movement of the carbons towards each other.\r\nSeveral kinds of apparatus are used for this purpose, but they all\r\ndepend upon the principle of regulating the motions by the action of an\r\nelectro-magnet, formed by the current itself, which becomes weaker as\r\nthe carbons are farther apart. The movement is communicated to the\r\napparatus by clockwork. Duboscq’s electric lantern is shown in Fig. 262,\r\nwith enlarged images of the carbon points projected on a screen. The\r\nmechanism of the regulator is contained within the cylindrical box\r\nimmediately below the lantern. The supports of both carbons are moved;\r\nthat which bears the positive carbon pole being advanced twice as fast\r\nas the other, and thus the light is maintained at the same level, for\r\nthe positive carbon wears away twice as fast as the other. The light is\r\nmore brilliant when charcoal is used instead of coke, but then it is\r\nnecessary to operate in a vacuum, to avoid the combustion of the\r\ncharcoal. The voltaic arc has recently been applied to illuminate\r\nlighthouses, and for other purposes, and will probably soon be more\r\nwidely employed, for a cheap and convenient mode of producing a uniform\r\ncurrent of electricity has recently been discovered and will be\r\npresently described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 262.—_Duboscq’s Electric Lantern and Regulator._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 263.—_Decomposition of Water._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe current which is maintained by the chemical action taking place in\r\nthe cells of the battery can also be made to do chemical work outside of\r\nthe battery. When the poles of the battery are terminated by wires or\r\nplates of platinum, and these are plunged into water acidulated with\r\nsulphuric acid, bubbles of gas are seen to rise rapidly from each wire,\r\nor _electrode_, as it is termed. Fig. 263 shows an arrangement by which\r\nthese gases may be collected separately, and examined, by simply placing\r\nover each electrode an inverted glass tube, filled also with the\r\nacidulated water. The gases collect at the tops of the tubes, displacing\r\nthe water, and it is found that from the wire connected with the zinc\r\nend of the battery, or negative electrode, hydrogen gas is given off,\r\nwhile at the positive electrode oxygen gas is liberated, in volume\r\nprecisely equal to half that of the hydrogen. This being the proportion\r\nin which these two substances combine to produce water, it appears that\r\nin the passage of the current a certain quantity of water is decomposed;\r\nand the quantity thus decomposed is in reality a measure of the current,\r\nall the other effects of which are found to be proportional to this.\r\nWhen the electricity in a current is said to be measured, it is simply\r\nthe power of the current to deflect a magnet, or the quantity of gas it\r\ncan liberate, or some other such effect, which is in fact measured. The\r\ndischarge of a Leyden jar through such an apparatus as that represented\r\nin Fig. 263 would present no perceptible decomposition of the water; yet\r\nsuch a discharge passed through the arms and body produces, as everybody\r\nknows, a painful shock, and is accompanied by a bright spark and a\r\nnoise, while the simultaneous contact of the fingers with the positive\r\nand negative poles of the galvanic battery occasions neither shock nor\r\nspark. Thousands of discharges from large jars must be passed through\r\nacidulated water to liberate the amount of gas which a battery current\r\nof a second’s duration will produce. The electricity of the jar is often\r\nspoken about as having a higher _tension_ than that of the battery, but\r\nthe latter sets an immensely greater quantity of electricity in motion.\r\nThe idea may be illustrated thus: Suppose we have a small cistern of\r\nwater placed at a great height, and that this water could fall to the\r\nground in one mass. The fall of the small quantity from a great height\r\nwould be capable of producing very marked instantaneous effects, such as\r\nsmashing, as with a blow, any structure upon which it might fall. This\r\nwould correspond with the small quantity of electricity which passes in\r\nthe discharge of a Leyden jar. Contrast this with the case in which we\r\nallow a very large quantity of water to descend from a very small\r\nheight—as when the water of a reservoir is flowing down a gently\r\ninclined channel. It is plain that a different kind of effect might be\r\nproduced in this case; the current might be made, for instance, to turn\r\na water-wheel, which the more forcible impact of the small quantity of\r\nwater in the case first supposed would have broken into pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 264.—_Electro-plating._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the apparent decomposition of water by the electric\r\ncurrent is in reality a secondary effect, and that it is the sulphuric\r\nacid which is decomposed. When, instead of acidulated water, we place in\r\nthe apparatus a solution of sulphate of copper, it is found that\r\nmetallic copper is deposited on the negative electrode, and sulphuric\r\nacid collects at the positive electrode. The metal is deposited in a\r\nfirm and coherent state, and the useful applications of this deposition\r\nof metals are of great interest and importance. For, in a similar\r\nmanner, gold, silver, lead, zinc, and other metals may be made to form\r\nthin uniform layers over any properly prepared surface. The immense\r\nadvantages which the arts have derived from electro-plating illustrate\r\nin a convincing manner the benefits which physical science can confer on\r\nsociety at large.\r\n\r\nThe process of electro-plating may be practised by the aid of apparatus\r\nof very simple character. Fig. 264 shows all that is necessary for\r\nobtaining perfect casts in copper of seals, small medals, &c. A A is a\r\nsection of a common tumbler; B B is a tube, made by rolling some brown\r\npaper round a ruler, uniting the edge with sealing-wax, and closing the\r\nbottom by a plug of cork, round which the paper may be tied by a string,\r\nor in any other convenient manner. The tumbler contains a solution of\r\nsulphate of copper, and the tube is filled with water, to which about\r\none-twentieth of its bulk of sulphuric acid has been added. A strip of\r\n_amalgamated_ zinc, or a piece of thick amalgamated zinc wire, is placed\r\nin the tube, and a piece of copper bell-wire is twisted round the top of\r\nit, and has attached to its other extremity, and immersed in the copper\r\nsolution, the article which is to be covered with copper. We may suppose\r\nthat this is to be a cast in white wax or in plaster of one side of a\r\nmedal. The cast is carefully covered with black lead by means of a soft\r\nbrush, and the copper wire is inserted in such a manner as to be in\r\ncontact with the black lead at some part. When the apparatus has been\r\nleft for some hours in the position represented, a deposit of copper\r\nwill be found over the blackleaded surface, and it will be a perfect\r\nimpression of the wax cast.\r\n\r\nSuch a copper cast, or any article in copper having a perfectly clean\r\nsurface, can be readily covered by a film of silver by means of a\r\nsimilar arrangement, where a solution of cyanide of potassium, in which\r\nsome chloride of silver has been dissolved, is made to take the place of\r\nthe sulphate of copper. Electro-plating with the precious metals has\r\nbecome a commercial industry of great importance; and this process has\r\ncompletely superseded the old plan of covering the metallic article to\r\nbe plated with an amalgam of silver or of gold, and then exposing it to\r\nheat, which volatized the mercury, leaving a thin film of gold or of\r\nsilver adhering to the baser metal. On the large scale a battery of\r\nseveral cells is used for electro-plating, and the articles are immersed\r\nin the metallic solutions as the negative poles of the battery; any\r\nrequired thickness of deposit being given according to the length of the\r\ntime they remain. At the works of Messrs. Elkington, of Birmingham,\r\nthese operations are conducted on a grand scale. The liquid there\r\nemployed for silvering is a solution of cyanide of silver in cyanide of\r\npotassium, and the positive pole is formed of a plate of silver, which\r\ndissolves in proportion as the metal is deposited on the negative pole.\r\nAs the charging of batteries is a troublesome operation, and their\r\naction is liable to variations which affect the strength of the\r\ncurrents, the more uniform, more convenient, and more economical mode of\r\nproducing currents by magneto-electricity, which will presently be\r\ndescribed, has been to a great extent substituted for the voltaic\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 265.—_A Current producing a Magnet._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wire conveying a current not only affects a magnetic needle in the\r\nmanner already described, but itself possesses magnetic properties, of\r\nwhich, indeed, its action on the needle is the result and the\r\nindication. If such a wire be plunged into iron filings, it will be\r\nfound that the filings are attracted by it: they cling in a layer of\r\nuniform thickness round its whole circumference and along its whole\r\nlength, and the moment the connection with the battery is broken they\r\ndrop off. This experiment shows that every part of the wire conveying a\r\ncurrent is magnetic, and it may be proved that the action is not\r\nintercepted by the interposition of any non-magnetic material. Thus the\r\naction of the wire upon the magnetic needle takes place equally well\r\nthrough glass, copper, lead, or wood. Consequently, if we cover the wire\r\nwith a layer of gutta-percha, or over-spin it with silk or cotton, we\r\nshall obtain like results on our filings, and if we coil the covered\r\nwire round a bar of iron, while the non-conducting covering of the wire\r\nwill compel the current to circulate through all the turns of the coil,\r\nit will not interfere with the magnetic action on each particle of the\r\nbar. Whenever this is done it is found that the iron is converted into a\r\npowerful magnet so long as the current passes. Fig. 265 represents in a\r\nstriking manner the result when the current is made to circulate through\r\nnumerous convolutions of the wire; and as each turn adds its effect to\r\nthat of the rest, magnets of enormous strength may be formed by\r\nsufficiently increasing the number of the turns. The end of the iron bar\r\nis shown projecting from the axis of the coil, and below it is placed a\r\nshallow wooden bowl, containing a number of small iron nails. The\r\ninstant the battery connection is completed these nails leap up to the\r\nmagnetic pole, and group themselves round it in the manner shown in the\r\ncut; and again, when the current is interrupted, the iron reverts to its\r\nordinary condition, the magnetism vanishes, and the nails drop down in\r\nan instant. These effects may be produced again and again, as often as\r\nthe current flows and is broken. A magnet so produced is called an\r\n_electro-magnet_, to distinguish it from the ordinary permanent steel\r\nmagnets. By coiling the conducting wire round a bar of iron which has\r\nbeen bent into the form of a horse-shoe, very powerful magnets may be\r\nproduced, and enormous weights may be supported by the force of the\r\nmagnetic attraction so evoked. Fig. 266 represents the apparatus for\r\nexperiments of this kind, in which weights exceeding a ton can be\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 266.—_An Electro-magnet._\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a striking instance of the subtile agent\r\nelectricity, evoked by the contact of a few pieces of zinc with dilute\r\nacid, showing itself capable of exerting an enormous mechanical force.\r\nEngines have been constructed in which this force is turned to account\r\nto produce rotatory motion as a source of power. Such engines have\r\ncertain advantages for special purposes; but the money cost for\r\nexpenditure of material for power so obtained is, at least, sixty times\r\ngreater than in the case of the steam engine. It is, however, in\r\nproducing mechanical effects at a distance that the electric current\r\nfinds the most interesting practical application of its magnetic\r\nproperties. These are the actions which are so extensively utilized in\r\nthe construction of telegraphic instruments, of clocks regulated by\r\nelectric communication with a standard time-keeper, and of many\r\ningenious self-registering instruments. The telegraph will be described\r\nin the next article, and we shall also have occasion in subsequent\r\narticles to describe some of the other applications of electro-magnetic\r\nand electro-chemical force.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _INDUCED CURRENTS._\r\n\r\nThese very remarkable phenomena were discovered by the illustrious\r\nFaraday, in 1830, and this discovery, and that of magneto-electricity,\r\nmay be ranked among the most memorable of his many brilliant\r\ncontributions to electric science. Let two wires be stretched parallel\r\nand very near to each other, but not in contact. Let the extremities of\r\none wire, which we shall term A, be connected with a galvanometer (page\r\n415), so that the existence of any current through the wire may be\r\ninstantly indicated. Let the two extremities of the other wire, B, be\r\nput into connection with the poles of a battery. The moment the\r\nconnection is complete, and the battery current _begins_ to rush through\r\nB, a deflection of the galvanometer needle will be observed, indicating\r\na current of very short duration through A in the opposite direction to\r\nthe battery current through B. This induced current, which is called the\r\n_secondary_ current, does not continue to flow through A: it occurs\r\nmerely at the time the _primary_ or battery current is established; and\r\nthough the latter continues to flow through the wire, B, no further\r\neffect is produced in the other wire. When, however, the battery\r\nconnection is broken, and the primary current ceases to flow, at that\r\ninstant there is set up in the wire, A, another momentary secondary\r\ncurrent, but this one is in the _same_ direction as the battery current.\r\nThis is termed the _direct secondary_ current, in opposition to the\r\nformer, which is called the _inverse_ current.\r\n\r\nThese effects are much more powerful when, instead of lengths of\r\nstraight wire, or single circles of wires, we use two coils of wire, one\r\nof which, namely, that which conveys the primary currents, is placed in\r\nthe axis of the other. It must be distinctly understood that the\r\nsecondary currents are of momentary duration only; they are not produced\r\nat all while the battery _is flowing_, but only at the time of its\r\ncommencement and cessation. If, however, we make the primary coil so\r\nthat it can be slid in and out of the axis of the other, then while the\r\nprimary current is continuously flowing, we can produce secondary\r\ncurrents in the other coil, by causing the coils to approach or recede\r\nfrom each other. As we bring the coils near each other, and slide the\r\nprimary into the secondary, the current in the latter is _inverse_; when\r\nthe one coil is receding from the other, it is _direct_. These\r\nmechanical actions are not produced without expenditure of force, for\r\nthe approaching coils repel each other and the receding coils attract\r\neach other. The setting up of the battery current in the primary coil\r\nwhen placed within the other is equivalent to bringing it, with the\r\ncurrent flowing, from an immense distance in an extremely small time.\r\nSimilarly, when the battery current is broken, it is equivalent to an\r\ninstantaneous recession. The effects, therefore, are proportionately\r\npowerful. It is found, also, and this we shall presently refer to more\r\nfully, that when, instead of the primary coil, a magnet is similarly\r\nmoved into, or removed from, the axis of the secondary coil, currents in\r\nopposite directions are set up in the latter without any battery being\r\nused at all. The direction of these currents is the same as would be\r\nproduced by a primary current that would form, in a piece of iron placed\r\nin the axis of the coil, an electro-magnet with poles similarly situated\r\nto those of the magnet so introduced or withdrawn. Hence, by placing a\r\nbar of soft iron in the axis of the primary coil, the secondary currents\r\nwill be produced with increased force. When a long secondary coil,\r\nhaving the turns of its wire well insulated from each other, surrounds a\r\nprimary coil provided with a core of soft iron, or still better, with a\r\nbundle of annealed iron wires, a series of powerful discharges, like\r\nthose of a Leyden jar, may be obtained between the terminals of the\r\nsecondary coil, when the battery contact is made and broken in rapid\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 267.—_Ruhmkorff’s Coil._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch induction coils have been very carefully and skilfully constructed\r\nby Ruhmkorff, and are therefore often called “Ruhmkorff’s Coils.” One of\r\nthese is represented in Fig. 267. A B is the coil, and the apparatus is\r\nprovided with what is termed a _condenser_, which consists of layers of\r\ntin-foil placed between sheets of thick paper, and alternately connected\r\nso that one set communicates with one extremity of the primary coil, and\r\nthe other with the other. This condenser is conveniently contained in\r\nthe wooden base of the instrument. Its introduction has greatly\r\nincreased the intensity of the secondary current, and sparks of 18 in.\r\nor 20 in. in length have been obtained in the place of very short ones.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that of the two secondary currents, only one has\r\nsufficient intensity to traverse the secondary circuit when there is any\r\nbreak in its continuity. This is the _direct secondary current_, or that\r\nwhich is produced on breaking the primary circuit. The reason is that\r\nthe commencing current in the primary circuit induces in the spires of\r\nits own coil an inverse current, and the battery current therefore\r\nattains its full strength gradually, but still in a very short time;\r\nwhile, on the cessation of the battery current, the same induction sends\r\na wave of electricity through the primary coil in the same direction,\r\nand then the current ceases abruptly. Consequently, in the latter case,\r\nthe induced electricity of the secondary coil is set in motion in much\r\nless time, and therefore possesses much greater intensity.\r\n\r\nThe magnetism of the iron core is usually made use of to break and make\r\nthe current, by the attraction of a piece of iron attached to a spring,\r\nwhich, by moving towards the end of the core, separates from a point in\r\nconnection with the battery, and, the current no longer flowing, the\r\nmagnetism ceases, and the spring again brings back the iron and renews\r\nthe contact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 268.—_Discharge through Rarefied Air._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy means of such coils many surprising effects have been produced.\r\nPerhaps one of the most beautiful experiments in the whole range of\r\nphysical science is made by causing the discharges of the secondary coil\r\nto take place through an exhausted vessel in the manner represented in\r\nFig. 268. A beautiful light fills the interior of the vessel, and the\r\nterminals appear to glow with a strange radiance—one being surrounded\r\nwith a kind of blue halo and another with a red. On reversing the\r\ndirection of the currents, which is done by the little apparatus at the\r\nright-hand end of the coil in Fig. 267, the blue and the red radiance\r\nchange places. Beautiful flashes of light may also be made to appear in\r\nthe vessel, having the most marked resemblance to the streamers of the\r\nAurora Borealis. When, instead of vessels almost free from common air,\r\nwe repeat the experiment with tubes containing an extremely small\r\nresidue of some other gas, such as hydrogen, carbonic acid, &c., the\r\ncolour of the light and other appearances change Geissler’s tubes have\r\nalready been spoken of in connection with the spectroscope; but,\r\nindependently of that, the various beautiful appearances which such\r\ntubes have been made to present, by the introduction of fluorescent\r\nsubstances and other devices, render the induction coil an instrument of\r\nthe highest interest to the scientific amateur. Then there are striking\r\nphysiological and other effects which the coil is capable of producing.\r\nFor instance, we are able by its instrumentality to produce from\r\natmospheric air unlimited quantities of that singular modification of\r\noxygen which is called _ozone_. The electricity of the coil has been\r\nused for firing mines, torpedoes and cannons, and for lighting the\r\ngas-burners of large buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 268_a_.—_Large Induction Coil at the old Polytechnic Institution,\r\n    London._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Apps, who was well known as a skilful constructor of\r\nscientific apparatus, devoted much attention to improving the induction\r\ncoil, and he made a very large one for the Polytechnic Institution in\r\nRegent Street, London, which Institution was at that time the home of\r\npopular science, under the direction of Mr. Pepper. This coil is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 268_a_, surrounded by the somewhat scenic\r\naccessories which were then supposed to be required for making science\r\nattractive to the multitude. Externally, the coil appeared as a\r\ncylinder, nearly 5 feet long and 20 inches in diameter. From each end\r\nprojected smaller cylinders. All these and also the two upright pillars\r\nupon which the apparatus was supported were covered with ebonite. The\r\nlarge cylinder contained the primary coil, which was made of copper wire\r\none-tenth of an inch in diameter and 3,770 yards long, covered with\r\ncotton thread, and making about 6,000 turns round the central core. This\r\nprimary coil was inclosed in an ebonite tube ½-inch thick, and outside\r\nof the tube, occupying 4 feet 2 inches of its length, was the secondary\r\ncoil, containing 150 miles of silk covered wire, ·015 inch diameter, and\r\nvery carefully arranged for insulation, so as to resist the tension of\r\nthe electricity when the coil was in action. The condenser contained 750\r\nsquare feet of tin-foil, and 40 Bunsen cells supplied the current for\r\nthe primary coil. The power of this instrument was very great, for it\r\nwould give a spark through the air of more than two feet in length, and\r\nthe discharge could perforate a certain thickness of glass. It would\r\ncharge a battery of Leyden jars having 40 square feet of tin-foil by\r\nonly three breaks of contact in the primary circuit, so that the\r\ndischarge would deflagrate considerable lengths of wire. The appearance\r\nof the spark, with this, as with other large induction coils, may be\r\ndescribed as a thick line of light, surrounded by a reddish halo of less\r\nbrilliancy, and this halo, unlike the line of the spark, had a sensible\r\nduration. The reddish glow might be blown aside by a current of air when\r\na series of discharges was taking place, and partly separated from the\r\ndenser looking line of light. The latter is no doubt formed by intensely\r\nheated particles of the metals between which the discharge takes place,\r\nwhile the former is probably due to the incandescence of the oxygen and\r\nnitrogen gases in the air. The disc shown in our illustration behind the\r\ncoil was for carrying six Geissler tubes, to display the pretty\r\nexperiment of the various colours of the luminous discharge in different\r\nattenuated gases. When the coil was first mounted it was provided with\r\nan ordinary contact-breaker, but as the strong sparks were found to very\r\nsoon destroy the contact points, a contact-breaker was substituted on\r\nFoucault’s plan. In this, the contacts are made by a platinum tipped\r\nwire dipping into mercury, that occupies the bottom of a strong glass\r\nvessel and forms part of the circuit. The vessel is filled with alcohol,\r\nwhich is a non-conductor, and it is therefore in the midst of this\r\nliquid that the contacts are made and broken. This apparatus is shown in\r\nthe illustration, on the table at the left. A favourite experiment at\r\nthe Polytechnic was to connect one of the discharging wires of the coil\r\nwith the back of a large looking-glass, and bring the other wire to the\r\nfront. In this case the sparks assumed a peculiar appearance, for they\r\nbecame thin and wiry-looking, and divided into many branches. They were\r\nvery bright, and the noise of the discharges, was crackling and quite\r\ndifferent from that produced by the blow of the flaming sparks taken\r\nthrough the air. Their appearance is represented in Fig. 269. The\r\neffects in this experiment were probably due to the spark taking a path\r\non the surface of the glass determined by points of moisture or other\r\ninequalities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 269.—_Spark on the Looking-glass._\r\n]\r\n\r\nRuhmkorff’s coil has been of great advantage to the electrician, for it\r\nsupplies a stream of _high tension_ electricity like that of the common\r\nmachine, but more readily and conveniently. M. Ruhmkorff was the first\r\nperson to obtain the great prize of £2,000, which the late Emperor of\r\nthe French (Napoleon III.) directed, in 1852, should be awarded every\r\nfive years for the most useful application of the voltaic battery. But\r\nno award had been made until 1864, when the inventor of the induction\r\ncoil was properly considered worthy of it. This invention was the means\r\nof bringing into notice a new range of interesting phenomena, especially\r\nthose attending the discharge passed through highly exhausted vessels.\r\nInvestigations into the circumstances which modify the appearances, and\r\nespecially into the nature of the _stratified discharge_ in which the\r\nvessels are filled with bands or flakes of light separated by dark\r\nintervals, have long engaged the attention of some of our ablest\r\nphysicists. Remarkable results were obtained by Mr. Crookes with very\r\nhighly exhausted vessels. These showed not only beautiful fluorescent\r\nluminous effects, but in them the discharge could produce mechanical\r\nactions, and Mr. Crookes was led to regard it as a stream of radiant\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _MAGNETO-ELECTRICITY._\r\n\r\nWhen it had been shown that an electric current was capable of evoking\r\nmagnetism, it seemed reasonable to expect that the reverse operation of\r\nobtaining electric currents by means of magnets should be possible.\r\nFaraday succeeded in solving this interesting problem in November, 1831,\r\nand one of his earliest, simplest, and most convincing experiments for\r\nthe demonstration of the production of electricity by a magnet is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 270. A B is a strong horse-shoe magnet, C is a\r\ncylinder of soft iron, round which a few feet of silk-covered copper\r\nwire are wound; one end of the wire terminates in a little copper disc,\r\nand the other end is bent, as shown at D, so that it is in contact with\r\nthe disc, but pressing so lightly against it that any abrupt movement of\r\nthe bar causes the point of the wire and the disc to separate. When the\r\nbar is allowed to fall upon the poles of the magnet, the separation\r\noccurs, and again when it is suddenly pulled off; and on each occasion a\r\nvery small but brilliant spark is observed where the contact of the wire\r\nand disc is broken. It was in allusion to this experiment that a\r\ncontributor to “Blackwood’s Magazine” wrote:\r\n\r\n                Around the magnet, Faraday\r\n                Is sure that Volta’s lightnings play;\r\n                    But how to draw them from the wire?\r\n                He took a lesson from the heart;\r\n                ‘Tis when we meet, ‘tis when we part,\r\n                    Breaks forth the electric fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 270.—_Magneto-electric Spark._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 271.—_A Magnet producing a Current._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 272.—_Clarke’s Magneto-electric Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf a coil of fine insulated wire be passed many times round a hollow\r\ncylinder, open at the ends, and the extremities of the wire connected\r\nwith a galvanometer at some distance, then if into the axis of the coil,\r\nA B, Fig. 271, a steel magnet be suddenly introduced, an immediate\r\ndeflection of the needle takes place; but after a few oscillations it\r\nreturns to its former position. When the magnet is quickly withdrawn,\r\nthe needle receives a momentary impulse in the opposite direction. The\r\nmagnetization and demagnetization of the iron core in the induction coil\r\nwould, therefore, of itself cause the induced currents already\r\ndescribed, for these actions are equivalent to sudden insertion and\r\nwithdrawal of a magnet. If we suppose C, in Fig. 271, to represent, not\r\na magnet, but a piece of soft iron—the reader will remember that this\r\nsoft iron can be, as often as required, magnetized and demagnetized by\r\nsimply bringing near one end of it the pole of a permanent magnet (see\r\npage 484). Upon this principle many ingenious machines have been\r\nconstructed for producing electric currents by the relative motions of\r\nmagnets and of soft iron cores surrounded by wires. Clarke’s machine is\r\nshown in Fig. 272. A is a powerful steel magnet fixed to the upright. A\r\nbrass spindle passing between the poles can be made to rotate very\r\nrapidly by the multiplying-wheel, E, on which a handle is fixed. There\r\nare two short cylinders of soft iron parallel to the spindle, united\r\ntogether by the transverse piece of iron, D, which turns with the\r\nspindle. Each bar is surrounded by a great length of insulated copper\r\nwire, and the ends of the wires are so connected with springs which\r\npress against a portion of the spindle, which is here partly formed of a\r\nnon-conducting material, that the currents generated in the coils,\r\nalthough in different directions as they approach a pole and recede from\r\nit, are nevertheless made to flow in one direction in the external\r\ncircuit. R R in the figure represent two brass handles, which are\r\ngrasped by a person wishing to experience the shocks the machine can\r\ngive when the wheel is turned. When the terminals of the coil are\r\nprovided with insulating handles and connected with pointed pencils of\r\ncharcoal, the electric light can readily be produced by expenditure of\r\nmechanical effort in turning the handle. The arrangement of the points\r\nfor this purpose is shown in Fig. 273, and we shall presently see what\r\nadvantage has been drawn from this experiment on a great scale as a\r\nsource of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 273.—_Magneto-electric Light._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that during the revolution of the armatures, as the\r\nwire-covered iron cores are termed, there are two maximum and two\r\nminimum points at which the currents are strongest and weakest. These\r\nvariations may be lessened by increasing the number of armatures and of\r\nmagnets, and Mr. Holmes arranged a machine with eighty-eight coils and\r\nsixty-six magnets, and the connections were so contrived that the\r\ncurrents always flowed in the same direction in the external circuit.\r\nThis machine required 1¼ horse-power to drive it when the currents were\r\nflowing, but much less when the circuit was interrupted, and it was\r\ndesigned for, and successfully applied to, the production of the\r\nelectric light for lighthouse illumination. Instead of steel magnets\r\nwhich gradually lose their strength, it is obvious that electro-magnets\r\nmight be employed, but this source of electricity is costly,\r\ntroublesome, and inconstant. Mr. Wilde hit upon the idea of using a\r\nsmall magneto-electric machine with permanent steel magnets, to generate\r\nthe current for exciting a larger electro-magnet, and the current from\r\nthis produced a still more powerful electro-magnet, from which a\r\nmagneto-electric current could be collected and applied. The same idea\r\nwas subsequently applied in other forms, as by shunting off a portion of\r\nthe current produced from the mere residual magnetism of an\r\nelectro-magnet, to pass through its own coils and evoke a stronger\r\nmagnetism, which again reacts by producing a more powerful current, and\r\nso on continually; the limit being dependent only on the mechanical\r\nforce employed, and on the power of the wires to convey the electricity,\r\nfor they become very hot, and, unless artificially cooled, the\r\ninsulating material would be destroyed. The armatures used in Wilde’s,\r\nLadd’s, and other machines of this kind, are quite different in\r\narrangement from those of Clarke’s machine, and are far superior. They\r\nare formed of a long bar of soft iron, of a section like this, Ꮋ, and\r\nthe wire is wound longitudinally between the flanges from end to end of\r\nthe bar, up one side and down the other. This armature rotates about its\r\nlongitudinal axis between the pairs of the poles of a file of horse-shoe\r\nmagnets, either permanent, or electro-magnets excited by the\r\nmagneto-electric currents. In this case opposite poles are induced along\r\nthe edges of the bar, and these poles are reversed at each half-turn.\r\nThe intensity of the induced currents increases with the velocity with\r\nwhich the armature is made to revolve up to a certain point; but because\r\nthe magnetization of the soft iron requires a sensible time to be\r\neffected, and the poles are reversed at every half-turn, it is found\r\nthat a speed increasing beyond the limit is attended by decrease of the\r\nintensity of the current. The intensity in such machines has, therefore,\r\na definite limit. But in a modification of the magneto-electric machine,\r\nwhich has quite recently been invented by M. Gramme, the limit is vastly\r\nextended by the ingenious disposition of the iron core and armatures,\r\nand his machines appear to solve the problem of the cheap production of\r\nsteady and powerful electric currents, so that electricity will soon be\r\napplied in processes of manufacture where the cost of electrical power\r\nhas hitherto placed it out of the question. We shall now endeavour to\r\nexplain the principle on which the Gramme machine depends, and describe\r\nsome forms in which it is constructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _THE GRAMME MAGNETO-ELECTRIC MACHINE._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 274.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 275.—_Gramme Machine for the Laboratory or Lecture Table._\r\n]\r\n\r\nLet X, Fig. 274, be a coil of covered wire; then while a bar magnet, B\r\nA, is advancing towards it and passing through it, as at M, a current\r\nwill flow through the coil and along a wire connecting its ends, _s s_.\r\nThe current will change its direction as the centre of the magnet is\r\nleaving the coil to advance in the direction, B A. If A A´ be a bar of\r\nsoft iron, with the coil fixed upon it, we can still excite currents in\r\nthe coil by magnetizing the bar inductively. If the pole of a permanent\r\nmagnet be carried along from A´ to M in a direction parallel to the bar,\r\nbut not touching it, the part of the bar immediately opposite will be a\r\npole of opposite name, and the advance of this induced pole towards M\r\nwill be attended with a current in the coil, and its recession by an\r\nopposite current. It need hardly be mentioned that the same result is\r\nattained if the magnetic pole is stationary, and the bar with the coil\r\nupon it moved in proximity to it. Now imagine that the bar is bent into\r\na ring, the ends, A A´, being united. If the ring be made to turn round\r\nits centre in its own plane, and near a magnetic pole, it is plain that\r\nwhen the coil is approaching this pole a current will be produced in it,\r\nand when it is receding, an opposite current. Let the number of coils be\r\nincreased, and each coil in turn will be the seat of a current, or of\r\nthe electrical state which tends to produce a current. In Fig. 275 the\r\nreader may see how this disposition is realized. The figure shows a form\r\nof the Gramme Machine adapted for the lecture-table or laboratory. A M´\r\nB M is the soft iron ring, covered with a series of separate coils\r\nplaced radially, O is a compound horse-shoe steel magnet, S its south\r\npole, N its north pole, each pole being armed with a block of soft iron\r\nhollowed into the segment of a circle and almost completely embracing\r\nthe circle of coils. The magnetism of each pole is strongly developed in\r\nthe interior faces of these armatures. The inductive action tends to\r\nproduce two equal and opposite currents, which, like the currents of two\r\nsimilar voltaic batteries joined by their like poles, neutralize each\r\nother in the connected coils, but flow together through an external\r\ncircuit. Fig. 276 will make clear the manner in which the coils, B B,\r\nare placed on the ring, A. The length of wire in each coil is the same,\r\nand the extremities are attached to strips of copper, R R, which are\r\nfixed on the spindle of the machine. The two ends of each wire are\r\nconnected with two consecutive strips, while the coils are insulated\r\nfrom each other, and thus each coil, like the element of a battery,\r\ncontributes to the aggregate current. The currents are drawn off, as it\r\nwere, from these axial conductors at two opposite points of the ring, by\r\nsprings very lightly touching them on each side of the spindle, as may\r\nbe seen in Fig. 275. In Fig. 277 is another arrangement of the table\r\napparatus with the magnet vertical, and formed according to the new plan\r\nsuggested by M. Jamin, who finds the best magnets are made by tying\r\ntogether thin strips of steel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 276.—_Insulated Coils surrounding an Annulus of Iron Wires._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 277.—_Hand Gramme Machine, with Jamin’s Magnet._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the importance of this invention consists in the facility which it\r\naffords for cheaply producing electricity on a scale adapted for\r\nindustrial operations, for the deposition of metals, for artificial\r\nlight, and for chemical purposes. The great importance of a cheap\r\nelectric light for lighthouses prompted the British Government to permit\r\nthe inventor to exhibit the light thus produced from the Clock Tower of\r\nthe Houses of Parliament; for the signal light during the sittings of\r\nthe House had previously been produced by a gas-light. This electric\r\nlight was produced by a powerful Gramme machine, such as that shown in\r\nFig. 278, driven by a small steam engine in the vaults of the Houses of\r\nParliament, and the ordinary carbon points, reflectors, &c., were used\r\nin the Clock Tower, where the light was exhibited; copper wire ½ inch\r\ndiameter being used to convey the current from the machine to the\r\ncarbons. The result of these experiments may be gathered from the\r\nfollowing extract from an official report made by the engineers of the\r\nTrinity House:\r\n\r\n“Pursuant to the instructions received from the Deputy Master to furnish\r\nyou with my opinion on the relative merits of the electric and gas\r\nlights under trial at the Clock Tower, Westminster, I beg to submit the\r\nfollowing report:—On the evening of the 1st ultimo I was accompanied by\r\nSir F. Arrow (who kindly undertook to check my observations by his\r\nexperience) to the Westminster Palace, where we met Captain Galton,\r\nR.E., Dr. Percy, and some gentlemen connected with the electric and gas\r\napparatus under trial. I was informed that the stipulations under which\r\nthe lights were arranged were, that they be fixed white to illuminate a\r\nsector of the town surface of 180°, having a radius of three miles. I\r\nfirst examined the Gramme magneto-electric machine, in use for producing\r\nthe currents of electricity. This machine we found attached by a leather\r\ndriving-belt to the steam engine belonging to the establishment. We then\r\nproceeded to the Clock Tower, where we found the electric lamp, at an\r\nelevation of 250 ft. The Wigham gas apparatus was placed at the same\r\nelevation, within a semi-lantern of twelve sides, about 8½ ft. in\r\ndiameter, and 10 ft. 3 in. high in the glazing. Near the centre of the\r\nlantern were three large Wigham burners, each composed of 108 jets.\r\nAfter the examination of the apparatus, we proceeded to Primrose Hill,\r\nfor the purpose of comparing the electric and gas lights at a distance\r\nof three miles. The evening, which was wet and rather misty, was\r\nadmirably suited to our purpose, ordinary gas-lights being barely\r\nvisible at a distance of one mile.”\r\n\r\nThe results of a photometric comparison of the electric and gas lights\r\nwere as under, the machine making 389 revolutions per minute, and\r\nabsorbing 2·66 horse-power; the illuminating power of the gas used being\r\n25 candles, and the quantity consumed 300 cubic ft. per hour.\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┐\r\n │                                               │ Electric │Wigham Gas│\r\n │                                               │  Light.  │ Burner.  │\r\n │                                               │          │108 jets. │\r\n ├───────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┤\r\n │Relative intensity of lights                   │    945·56│    370·56│\r\n │      Or as                                    │    100   │     39·19│\r\n │Illuminating power in standard sperm candles as│  3,066   │  1,199   │\r\n │  units                                        │          │          │\r\n └───────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\n“_Electric Light._—Total cost per session £174 5_s._ 0_d._, being equal\r\nto 5_s._ 7_d._ per hour of exhibition of the light.

It\r\nis to be remembered that in dealing with the small electric spark as the\r\nfocus of a dioptric apparatus for distribution over the required area,\r\nthe light can be more perfectly utilized than with the large gas flame\r\nof the Wigham burner, owing to its very small dimensions as compared\r\nwith the latter. The relative cost and efficiency of the three modes of\r\nillumination may be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┬────────┬─────────────────┐\r\n │                                          │ELECTRIC│      GAS.       │\r\n │                                          │ LIGHT. │                 │\r\n ├──────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┼────────┬────────┤\r\n │                                          │        │  One   │ Three  │\r\n │                                          │        │108–jet │108–jet │\r\n │                                          │        │Burner. │Burners.│\r\n ├──────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤\r\n │Cost of light per hour, in pence          │   67   │  61·4  │ 113·9  │\r\n │    Or as                                 │  100   │  91·6  │  170   │\r\n │Cost of light per candle per hour in pence│ ·0219  │ ·0512  │ ·0317  │\r\n │    Or as                                 │  100   │ 233·8  │ 144·7  │\r\n │Cost of light from a dioptric apparatus   │ ·00118 │ ·00310 │ ·00275 │\r\n │  for fixed light per standard candle per │        │        │        │\r\n │  hour expressed in pence                 │        │        │        │\r\n │    Or as                                 │  100   │ 262·7  │ 233·1  │\r\n └──────────────────────────────────────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘\r\n\r\n“Thus by adopting the electric light as a standard of intensity and\r\ncost, there is shown a superiority over the gas in intensity of 65·2 per\r\ncent. when using one 108–jet burner, and 27·1 per cent. when using three\r\n108–jet burners. There is also shown a saving in cost per candle or unit\r\nof light per hour of 162·7 per cent. when using one 108–jet burner, and\r\n133·1 per cent. when using three of these burners, forming a triform\r\ngas-light. It is further to be remembered that the triform gas-light\r\nactually represents the maximum power obtainable at present by gas; but\r\nno reference has been made to the power of increase capable in the\r\nelectric light by the adoption of two magneto-electric machines. By\r\nhaving the machine and lamp in duplicate, as estimated, and which I\r\nconsider a necessity to insure perfect confidence in the regular\r\nexhibition of the electric light, this light can be doubled in intensity\r\nduring such evenings as the atmosphere is found to be so thick as to\r\nimpair its efficiency. This double power would be obtained at the\r\ntrifling additional cost of coals and carbons consumed during the time\r\nthis increased power may be found to be necessary; this additional cost\r\nI estimate at 4_d._ per hour. With the arrangement proposed for the\r\nelectric light, I consider this powerful illuminant, if manipulated by\r\ncareful attendants, perfectly reliable: in proof of this I may state\r\nthat the electric light at the Souter Point Lighthouse, on the coast of\r\nDurham, has now been exhibited two years and a half, and the light has\r\nnever been known to fail for one minute.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 278.—_Gramme Machine, with Eight Vertical Electro-magnets._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 279.—_Gramme Machine, with Horizontal Electro-magnets._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 278 represents one of the light-producing machines. The\r\nelectro-magnets are excited by a portion of the currents they themselves\r\nproduce, they retaining sufficient residual magnetism to develop the\r\ncurrents. There is a pair of current-collectors on each side. This\r\nmachine weighs 1,540 lbs., its height is 3 ft., and width 2 ft. It will\r\nproduce a light having the intensity of 500 Carcel lamps, which may be\r\ndoubled by increasing the speed. Fig. 279 is another form which is also\r\nadapted for illuminating purposes, and, when made with fewer coils, for\r\nelectrotyping purposes also. There are in this also two sets of\r\ncurrent-collectors, and by means of a connecting cylinder (seen at the\r\nbase of the machine) the currents can be combined for quantity and for\r\ntension as may be required. This machine is only about 2 ft. square, and\r\nit produces a light equal to 200 burners; but this may be increased, as\r\nthe following table shows:\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐\r\n │Number of revolutions│Intensity of light in│        Remarks.         │\r\n │     per minute.     │    Carcel Lamps.    │                         │\r\n ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤\r\n │                  650│                   77│No heating and no sparks.│\r\n │                  850│                  125│No heating and no sparks.│\r\n │                  880│                  150│No heating and no sparks.│\r\n │                  900│                  200│No heating and no sparks.│\r\n │                  935│                  250│A little heat, no sparks.│\r\n │                1,025│                  290│Heat and sparks.         │\r\n └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe value of M. Gramme’s invention for electro-plating is proved by the\r\nfact of its adoption by Messrs. Christofle of Paris, whose\r\nelectro-plating establishment is one of the largest in the world. This\r\nfirm has no fewer than fourteen of these machines at work, and each is\r\ncapable of depositing 74 ozs. of silver per hour. There is little doubt\r\nthat the electric current will now soon be employed for reducing metals.\r\nThus fine copper, which is worth 3_s._ or 4_s._ per lb., may perhaps be\r\nobtained at about the cost of ordinary copper; potassium, sodium, and\r\naluminium at less than half their present price; and magnesium, calcium,\r\nand other rare metals at prices which will bring them into commercial\r\nuse. The machine shown in Fig. 280 is intended for electro-plating and\r\nfor general purposes: it supplies the means of readily and cheaply\r\nplating with copper, or with any other metal, such articles as steam\r\npipes, boiler tubes, ship plates, guns, bolts, nails, marine engines,\r\nmachinery, culinary vessels, cisterns, &c. The advantage of protecting\r\niron or other material from corroding agents is obvious; and as iron\r\ncoated with copper is available not only for useful, but also for\r\nartistic, purposes, as a cheap substitute for bronze, this invention\r\nwill doubtless lead to a greatly extended application of bronzed iron in\r\nbuildings and ornamental structures.\r\n\r\nThe machine well illustrates how mechanical work may be changed into\r\nelectricity, and electricity caused to do work. The power required to\r\ndrive the machine at a given speed is much less when no current is being\r\ndrawn from it, than when the current is flowing. If the current from one\r\nmachine is sent through the armature of another, the latter revolves,\r\nand may be made to do work. Thus _power_ may be conveyed to a distance\r\nby electricity, with only the loss caused by the resistance of the\r\nconducting wires. If, when two machines are thus connected, the\r\ndirection of rotation in the first one be suddenly reversed, the\r\narmature of the second will almost immediately stop, and then resume its\r\nmotion in the opposite direction. A very interesting experiment can be\r\nperformed when the circuit connecting the two machines is made to\r\ninclude a certain length of platinum wire. When both machines are in\r\nmotion, the platinum exhibits no heating effects; but if the second\r\nmachine be stopped by an assistant while the rotation of the first is\r\ncontinued, the wire is raised to a red heat. In this way it is shown\r\nthat motion, electricity, and heat are related to each other, and are\r\nmutually convertible; for on the stopping of the second machine, the\r\nelectricity being no longer used up, so to speak, in producing motion,\r\nhas its power transformed into heat.\r\n\r\nThe Gramme machine has also been ingeniously employed for railway brakes\r\non some of the Belgian lines; and it is applicable to telegraphy, where\r\nthe cost of zinc, acids, batteries, &c., is a considerable item. It is\r\nimpossible to predict the many applications for manufacturing purposes\r\nwhich will be made of electricity, now a cheap, reliable, and convenient\r\nmode has been discovered of producing currents of any required strength.\r\nThough by no means the first or only machine by which mechanical force\r\ncan be converted into dynamical electricity, it shows an immense advance\r\non any former one in the regularity of the action, and in the capability\r\nof being driven at a very high rate of speed without the inconvenient\r\naccompaniments of the heating of the conductors and destructive sparks\r\nat the movable contacts. There can be no doubt of the importance of this\r\nmachine for use in lighthouses, and for metallurgical and chemical\r\npurposes, and the inventor believes the time will come when all large\r\nocean-going vessels will carry an electric light at the masthead. The\r\nlight would be sufficiently powerful to show rocks or land five or six\r\nmiles ahead, and an additional safeguard of incalculable value would be\r\nthus provided for those “that go down to the sea in ships, that do\r\nbusiness in great waters.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                _ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND ELECTRIC POWER._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_a_.—_The Alliance Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned in the last section that the introduction of so\r\nconvenient and reliable a means of producing electrical currents as the\r\nGramme machine, would cause electricity to be largely applied for\r\nilluminating and other purposes. The Gramme machine was first made in\r\n1870, and it attracted much attention, as the principle of combining the\r\ncurrents was quite different from that used in previous magneto-electric\r\nmachines. In fact, the Gramme machine yielded quite unexpected results,\r\nand the principle employed in it opened a new field. The development\r\nthat has taken place in the applications of electricity within the\r\ntwenty years since 1870 has been truly marvellous. The electric light\r\nappears to have been first used in lighthouses about 1862, and the\r\nmachines by which the current was produced were, in principle,\r\ncombinations of a great number of Clarke’s machines (see page 509). One\r\nsuch machine was invented by Mr. Holmes, and was used for the\r\nillumination of the South Foreland Lighthouse in 1862. Another similar\r\nform of still earlier invention had been set up in Paris as early as\r\n1855,—not, indeed, for the purposes of illumination, but for a project\r\nwhich failed. Its arrangement had been originally suggested by a Belgian\r\nphysicist in 1849; and the machine of 1855, having received certain\r\nimprovements, afterwards became very well known by the name of the\r\n_Alliance Company’s_ machine, or simply the _Alliance_ machine. It is\r\nrepresented in its improved form in Fig. 280_a_. Here ranges of steel\r\nhorse-shoe magnets will be observed, each magnet weighing about 40 lbs.\r\nand made of six plates of tempered steel, held together with screws.\r\nEach of the eight rows of magnets contains seven, and thus sixteen poles\r\nare presented at uniform distances, arranged in circles. Carried on the\r\ncentral axle are six discs, which revolve between the circles of sixteen\r\npoles, and on the circumference of each disc are sixteen equidistant\r\nbobbins or coils of insulated wire, so that the whole of the sixteen\r\ncoils are opposite to the sixteen poles at the same moment. The\r\nextremities of the wires at the coils are connected with proper\r\nadjustments for gathering up the currents, and by means of these the\r\ncoils may be arranged either for tension or for quantity, like the\r\nelements of a battery (page 494).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_b_.—_Wilde’s Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWilde’s machine, which has been mentioned in page 511, is shown in fig.\r\n280_b_. It will be observed that this consists of a small machine, M,\r\nwith permanent steel magnets, and the current from these circulates\r\nthrough the coils of the electro magnets, A B. The arrangement of the\r\narmatures, bobbin, commutators, etc., is the same in both cases. But as\r\na speed of 2,500 revolutions per minute was needed, it was necessary to\r\nkeep the bearings, T T, from heating by causing cold water to circulate\r\nthrough them. Mr. Ladd arranged a machine on the same principle as\r\nWilde’s, by suppressing the permanent magnets, but availing himself of\r\nthe _residual_ magnetism of the iron core to bring about the induction.\r\nA machine of this kind was shown at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, and\r\npeople were quite astonished to see electrical power capable of\r\nproducing a brilliant light developed by a small machine 2 ft. long, 1\r\nft. wide, and 9 in. high. But the great velocity of rotation, and the\r\nconsequent heating of the bearings, left much to be desired before a\r\nreally practical machine could be produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_c_.—_Siemens’ Dynamo._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the newest Siemens’ machine, represented in fig. 280_c_, the Gramme\r\nprinciple is made use of, as the revolving coil is of large diameter,\r\nand it consists of a copper cylinder, on which are wound a number of\r\njuxtaposed coils like those of a galvanometer. The revolving cylinder is\r\nsurrounded by the poles of a system of electro-magnets excited by the\r\nwhole of the induced current being passed through their coils. In a\r\npaper describing this machine, Siemens first made use of the term\r\n“dynamo-electric machine,” and this expression, contracted to the single\r\nword DYNAMO, has since been universally employed to designate machines\r\nof this kind. The modifications in the forms and arrangements of the\r\ndifferent dynamos that have been invented in late years are endless, and\r\nevery week patents are granted for further improvements and fresh\r\ncombinations of the parts. It would be quite beyond the scope of this\r\nwork to enumerate all the forms of the dynamo that have been favourably\r\nspoken of; but we shall content ourselves by adding a drawing of the\r\nBrush dynamo (Fig. 280_d_), which has been so largely used for electric\r\nlighting in the United States. In this dynamo we have a Gramme ring, but\r\nthe number of coils on it is reduced to eight, the intervals being\r\nfilled up with pieces of iron, and the ring revolves in a vertical plane\r\nbetween the poles of two double oblong electro-magnets, which are\r\narranged with poles of the same name opposite to each other. The\r\ncommutators shown in the nearer part convert the alternately reversed\r\ncurrents generated in the coils into a direct continuous one. They are\r\nformed with bundles of wires, as in the Gramme machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_d._—_The Brush Dynamo._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_e._—_Siemens’ Regulator._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the providing of a cheap and efficient source of current\r\nelectricity, although an absolutely necessary step, would not have been\r\ncapable of bringing about the present development of electric lighting,\r\nunless the appliances by which the current is made to manifest itself as\r\nlight had not also been brought nearly to perfection. The conditions\r\nrequired to maintain a steady light from a current of electricity\r\npassing between carbon points have been already explained on page 497,\r\nand a representation of Dubosc’s electric lantern and regulator is\r\nshown. The regulator systems that have been invented since it became\r\nobvious that the light of the electric arc admitted of practical\r\napplication on the large scale are very numerous. The earlier forms of\r\nregulator, which were used only for scientific purposes—such as lantern\r\nprojections on screens, experiments on light, etc.—were complicated in\r\ntheir arrangements and uncertain in their action, for great variations\r\nin the light sometimes took place, and occasionally it would, indeed, be\r\nextinguished, and then again shine out as brightly as before. Nearly all\r\nthe regulators that have come into use depend upon movements controlled\r\nby electro-magnetic actions produced automatically as the distance\r\nbetween the carbon changes. It would, however, lead us too far into the\r\ntechnicalities of the subject to explain minutely the mechanism of any\r\nparticular form of the mechanical regulators, and the results depend so\r\noften upon the minute details, that it would be difficult to trace the\r\naction without a set of large and complete drawings. Perhaps the\r\nregulators that have been most used are those of Serrin, Siemens, Brush,\r\nThomson, Houston and Edison. But nearly every inventor has produced\r\ndifferent forms of his apparatus; Siemens, for instance, has patented\r\neight or ten regulators. Fig. 280_e_ shows the mechanism of one of the\r\nlast named inventor’s regulators, in which the two actions required for\r\nthe separation and approach of the carbons are determined respectively\r\nby the vibrations of the rocking lever, M Y L, actuated by the\r\nelectro-magnet, E, and the simple weight of the upper carbon-holder, A\r\nA. When the lamp is not in circuit, the lever, L, is thrown back by a\r\nspring, the tension of which is regulated by the screw, R, so that the\r\ncatch, Q, is disengaged from the wheel, I. The train of wheels is then\r\nfree to revolve by action of the rack, A, supporting the weight of the\r\nupper carbon, until the motion stops by the carbons touching each other.\r\nNow let the lamp be connected up, and the current will pass from C,\r\nthrough the electro-magnet, the mass of the apparatus, and return by the\r\nwire connecting the lower carbon-holder with Z. The carbon points will\r\nglow, but the magnet then attracting M moves the lever, L, the piece, Q,\r\nengages the wheel I, pushing it one tooth forward. But this movement of\r\nthe lever establishes a contact at X, so that the current abandons the\r\nelectro-magnet, to pass the shorter way, and M being no longer\r\nattracted, the lever is pushed back by the spring, the contact at X is\r\nbroken, and the magnet being again excited the lever turns as before,\r\nand Q pushes I round the space of another tooth. These alternating\r\nactions succeed each other with great rapidity, and effect the\r\nseparation of the carbons through the train of wheels acting on the\r\nracks. These movements continue until, in a second or two, the\r\nseparation of the carbons has become so great, that the current passing\r\nthrough the electro-magnet is no longer able to operate against the\r\nweight of the upper carbon-holder, and this happens when an arc of\r\nproper size is produced, this required result being brought about by\r\nproper adjustment of the parts of the apparatus, marked by the letters\r\nR, K and X. But as the carbons are consumed, the increase of the length\r\nof this arc further weakens the current, until the spring attached to\r\nthe lever, L, prevails over the attractive force of the electro-magnet\r\non M, and thus withdraws the catch, Q, altogether, when the wheels being\r\nfree to turn, the weight operates to bring the carbons nearer together,\r\nuntil, with the lessened resistance, the energy of the current is\r\nrestored, and Q again comes into play to arrest the approximating\r\nmovement. It may be seen, from the above explanation, that this lamp is\r\nautomatic; in other words, when it has once been properly adjusted, it\r\nis lighted by merely completing the circuit. For fixing the carbons\r\nproperly in their holders there are, of course, other regulating screws.\r\nHow very nearly perfection the automatic regulation of the arc electric\r\nlamp has been brought by such contrivances as these, will be obvious to\r\nall who have noticed the steadiness that has been attained in all the\r\nmodern installations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_f_.—_Jablochkoff Candle._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn ingenious plan was devised by Jablochkoff for dispensing with all\r\nmechanism for regulating the distance of the carbons. This invention is\r\nknown as the _electric candle_, and is of great interest from the fact\r\nthat it was with this arrangement that the electric light was, for the\r\nfirst time, practically employed for street and theatre illumination.\r\nThis was in 1878, when visitors to Paris, during the Exhibition, were\r\nastonished by the splendid displays in the Avenue de l’Opéra, at the\r\nshops of the Louvre, and at some of the theatres. Then it was shown, for\r\nthe first time, that electric lighting was not merely a scientific\r\ncuriosity, but a new and formidable rival to gas. The Jablochkoff\r\ncandles were also subsequently used in the electric lamps on the Thames\r\nEmbankment. The principle of the contrivance will be understood from\r\nfig. 280_f_. Two carbons, C and D, are placed parallel at a little\r\ndistance apart, and the space between them is filled up with plaster of\r\nParis, kaolin, or some similar material, through which the current will\r\nnot pass, but which burns, fuses, volatilises, or crumbles away by the\r\nheat produced by the passage of the current between the two carbons.\r\nThese carbons are, of course, fixed in insulated holders, and to start\r\nthe candle a small tip of carbon paste is made to connect the carbons at\r\nthe top. The Jablochkoff candles must be used with currents rapidly\r\nalternating in direction. The reason for this is, that otherwise one of\r\nthe carbons (the positive one) would be consumed quicker than the other,\r\nand that would cause the distance between them to increase, until it\r\nbecame so great that the current would cease to pass, and the light\r\nwould go out. In order to obtain such alternating currents with the\r\nGramme machine, a special apparatus had to be devised to change its\r\ndirect into alternately reversed currents; but, dynamos intended to\r\nsupply electric lights are now made without commutators, and they supply\r\nrapidly succeeding currents in opposite directions. In certain types of\r\ndynamos, again, the armature coils are stationary, and it is the field\r\nmagnets that are made to revolve, and in these cases, not even a sliding\r\ncontact is required, but the end of the armature coils are directly and\r\npermanently connected with the main circuit. But as these dynamos are\r\nself-exciting, the electricity induced in a few of the armature coils is\r\ncollected apart from the main circuit, and passed through the\r\nelectro-magnets of the machine itself, after the alternate currents\r\nhave, by means of a commutator, been converted into one direct\r\ncontinuous current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_g_.—_Electric Lamp._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe arc electric light, as used for the illumination of streets and\r\npublic places, is too intense and concentrated to be pleasant to the\r\neye, and therefore it has been found necessary to surround it by globes\r\nof enamelled glass, or of porcelain, or of ground glass, or of frosted\r\nglass. By these expedients for diffusing and softening the light, it is\r\nrendered much more acceptable, but this advantage is gained at the cost\r\nof a considerable loss of the whole illuminating power, a loss which is,\r\nprobably, never less than 10 per cent., but is usually much greater. The\r\nglobes used in Paris, with the Jablochkoff candles, were of enamelled\r\nglass, and the apparatus was arranged, as shown in Fig. 280_g_, where it\r\nis partly represented in section, and with a part of the globe broken\r\noff, in order to show one of the candles placed in the holder which\r\nconnects it with the circuit. In each lamp several candles were mounted,\r\nin some cases four; but the lamps in the Place de l’Opéra held twelve.\r\nAt first there were mechanical arrangements, automatic and otherwise, by\r\nwhich, when the candle was burned down the current could be turned on to\r\nanother. But M. Jablochkoff afterwards discovered that there was really\r\nno need for such a mechanism. For when the whole of the candles are\r\nsimultaneously and equally connected with the circuit conductors, it is\r\nfound that one of them will more easily transmit the current than any\r\none of the rest, and when that particular one has once been lighted by\r\nthe heat developed, the current will pass almost entirely through the\r\narc, any loss through the connecting strip of carbon, at the tops of the\r\nother candles, being quite insignificant. When the first of the candles\r\nhas burnt down completely, until the insulating porcelain holder\r\nseparates the carbons, the current will at once re-establish itself at\r\nthe top of one of the remaining carbons, and so on, while one is left.\r\n\r\nThe arc electric light has not been brought to its present position\r\nwithout the expenditure of much care and ingenuity in the preparation of\r\nthe carbons used for its production. When Davy first produced the\r\nvoltaic arc, the electrodes he used were simply sticks of charcoal.\r\nThese were very quickly consumed, and a more durable form of carbon was\r\nsought for. This was found by Foucault, who made use of rods sawn out of\r\nthe carbonaceous residue left in the retorts in the process of making\r\ncoal-gas. This substance was, however, by no means uniform or\r\nsufficiently pure, and the light obtained was consequently unsteady.\r\nMany experiments were made in preparing special carbons. Pounded coke,\r\ncoke and charcoal, were mixed with syrup or tar into a paste, which was\r\nmoulded and compressed, and then the sticks were kept in covered vessels\r\nat a high temperature for many hours. Acids were used for purification,\r\nand also alkalis, to remove silica. At the present time there are\r\nseveral manufacturers of electric light carbons who carry on extensive\r\noperations by processes which probably are very similar one to another,\r\nand which may well be represented by M. Carré’s, whose carbons have the\r\nhighest reputation. M. Carré prefers a mixture of powdered coke,\r\ncalcined lampblack, and a syrup made of sugar and gum. The whole is well\r\nmixed and incorporated, water being added from time to time to make up\r\nfor loss by evaporation, and to give the paste the proper degree of\r\nconsistence. The paste is then subjected to compression, by which it is\r\nforced through draw-holes, and the carbons, having been piled up in\r\ncovered crucibles, are exposed for a certain time to a high temperature.\r\n\r\nAs a practical illuminant for lighthouses, the arc electric light came\r\ninto use many years ago (1862) as we have already seen. This was when\r\nthe generator of the current was the magneto-electro machine; but, now,\r\nwhen this generator has developed into the modern dynamo, the cost of\r\nthe electric supply has been enormously reduced, so that, power for\r\npower, electric lights may be worked at half the former cost, and with\r\ngreater convenience and certainty. Light for light, electrical\r\nillumination is said to be far cheaper than gas. Again, the arc electric\r\nlight has properties which have caused it to be employed, not only in\r\nevery important lighthouse in England, France, Russia, America, and\r\nelsewhere, but most ships of war are provided with means of projecting a\r\nbeam of electric light in any direction, in order that the presence of\r\ntorpedo boats, etc., may be discovered at night, or harbours entered and\r\nsignals made under circumstances when such operations would be otherwise\r\nimpossible. It was by the use of the electric light that, in 1886, one\r\nof the Peninsular and Oriental Company’s steamers passed safely through\r\nthe Suez Canal, at night, and the experiment was so satisfactory, that\r\nthe canal authorities placed beacons and light-buoys to guide such\r\nvessels, as, being provided with electric apparatus, were enabled to\r\nhold their proper course between its banks. The use of projected beams\r\nfor watching the movements of enemies, and for signalling to great\r\ndistances in time of war, has been recognized by all the great military\r\npowers. The advantage of the electrical light in some mines, in\r\nsubterranean and submarine operations and generally, in work that has to\r\nbe carried on at night by large bodies of men, is constantly finding\r\nillustration. Few readers are unacquainted with the brilliant effect of\r\nthe arc lamps in exhibitions, parks, &c.; at out of door fêtes, or\r\napplied to the illumination of fountains, such as those at the Paris\r\nExhibition of 1889.\r\n\r\nThe arc lamps are used in series; that is, where there are a certain\r\nnumber of lamps to be supplied, the same electrical current circulates\r\nthrough the whole of them, and this, of course, must have force enough\r\nto overcome the resistance of the whole circuit. Thus, at each lamp, the\r\nintensity of the illumination must necessarily be very great. A solution\r\nwas long sought to the problem of so dividing the current energy, that\r\nit might be made to produce lights, of moderate intensity, at a greater\r\nnumber of points. When Mr. Edison, shortly after having invented the\r\nphonograph, announced that he had solved the problem of the electric\r\nlight division, there was a great panic amongst the holders of shares in\r\ngas companies, and a heavy fall in this kind of stock immediately\r\noccurred. As it turned out, the alarm was unnecessary, for gas was not\r\nto be superseded, immediately and definitely, by electricity.\r\nNevertheless, it is by virtue of the principle that was contained in\r\nEdison’s invention, that electric lighting has assumed the wide-spread\r\nimportance it has at the present day, and that it is now actually\r\nousting gas as an illuminant in the business and domestic premises of\r\nour large towns, and in theatres, libraries, and other places of resort.\r\nThe principle which has brought about this great development of electric\r\nillumination is that shown in a simple form in Fig. 261. It appears,\r\nhowever, that as early as 1841, a platinum wire, made incandescent with\r\na battery current, was proposed as a source of light, and in 1845,\r\ncarbon was used in the form of slender rods, by King, and also by J. W.\r\nStarr, in the United States. Both inventors inclosed their carbons in\r\nglass tubes, from which the air was exhausted, so that the carbon might\r\nnot burn away. In the following year, Greener and Staite turned their\r\nattention to lamps of this kind, and, again, in 1849, Petrie worked on\r\nthe same subject. After that, the problem ceased to engage attention,\r\nuntil, in 1873, a Russian man of science, named Lodyguine, took the\r\nmatter up and patented a carbon incandescent lamp, which did not,\r\nhowever, prove a practical success, and although the idea was worked out\r\nin various ways by Konn, Reynier, Trouvé, and others, the apparatus they\r\ndesigned was, in every case, lacking in simplicity, and certainty of\r\naction. The Edison incandescent lamp, the announcement of the discovery\r\nof which so fluttered the gas companies, about 1878, was a reversion to\r\nthe plan of an incandescent metallic wire. This wire was made of an\r\nalloy of platinum and iridium, which was adopted by Edison on account of\r\nthe very high temperature required for its fusion. And in order to\r\nprevent the temperature from quite reaching that point, the wire was\r\narranged in a spiral within which was a rod of metal that, by its\r\ndilatation with a certain temperature, caused a contact to be made which\r\ndiverted part of the current through a shorter circuit, and thus lowered\r\nthe temperature of the spiral to within the assigned limits. But the\r\nadvantages presented by carbon over metallic conductors led Edison to\r\nattempt the formation of filaments by charring first slips of paper,\r\nafterwards slips of bamboo. About the same time Mr. J. W. Swan, of\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, was experimenting in the same direction, and, in the\r\nlatter part of the year 1880, he exhibited the first incandescent lamps\r\nshown in England. Swan’s carbon filaments were prepared from cotton\r\nthreads which had previously been steeped in dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nwashed, and passed through draw holes to give them an uniform section.\r\nThey are thus made perfectly homogeneous throughout, and, after having\r\nbeen wound on pieces of earthenware to the required shape, they are\r\ncarbonized by packing in powdered charcoal and heating. These filaments\r\nare very thin, but solid and elastic. The arrangement of the lamp (see\r\nFig. 280_h_) is extremely simple: the filament of carbon bent into a\r\nhorse-shoe form, or turned so as to form a loop, is inclosed in a glass\r\nbulb of a globular or egg shape, about two inches in diameter. The\r\nextremities of the filament are connected in an ingenious manner to two\r\nplatinum wires that pass outward through the glass into which they are\r\nfused, and terminate either in binding screws or in two small loops. The\r\nbulb is exhausted first by an ordinary air-pump, and then by a Sprengel\r\nmercurial pump, the current of electricity being sent through the\r\nfilament during the last stages of the process, and finally the bulb is\r\nhermetically sealed. The light yielded by these lamps is mild and\r\nsteady, and its intensity depends on the electric current sent through\r\nthem; but this may, it is said, be carried as high as to make the light\r\nequal to that of twenty candles. Each horse power of force expended on\r\nthe dynamo suffices to maintain ten of these lamps. At the Exhibition of\r\nElectrical Apparatus at Paris in 1881, the Swan lamp received the gold\r\nmedal as being the best system in its class. The Swan and the Edison\r\npatents are now worked together by one Company, and the productions of\r\nthis Company are very largely used, although there are several more or\r\nless modified systems of glow lamps prepared by other manufacturers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_h_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe great advantages offered by electric glow lamps over gas-lights\r\ncaused them to be speedily adopted by the most enterprising managers of\r\ntheatres and places of amusement. Mr. D’Oyly Carte had the Savoy\r\nTheatre, in London, completely fitted up with these lamps in 1881. The\r\nlight was soft and agreeable, it did away with the risks of fire both\r\nfor the audience and the performers: for the footlights and scene-lights\r\nwere also electric glow lamps, and the coolness of the house and greater\r\npurity of the air were at once appreciated. Several other London\r\ntheatres have since adopted the incandescent electric lamps, and it is\r\nobvious that the system will become universal. In all ocean-going\r\npassenger steamers, electric lighting of the saloons and cabins is now\r\nthe rule. No mode of illumination so readily adapts itself to the\r\nproduction of artistic and decorative effects as the glow lamps: for the\r\ncovering glasses may be tinted of any required shade, and the lights may\r\nbe placed in any position. Small glow lamps are occasionally used as\r\npersonal adornments, when placed, for instance, as part of a lady’s\r\nhead-dress amidst diamonds, a novel effect of great brilliancy is\r\nproduced. It need hardly be said that in this application the wearer is\r\nnot required to carry a dynamo about with her, for the electricity is\r\nsupplied in a manner much more convenient for this purpose by a device\r\npresently to be described. For several years electric incandescent\r\nlamps, supplied by the like means, have been in action every night in\r\nthe carriages of the trains running between London and Brighton, and\r\nmore recently the Company have had electric reading lamps of five\r\ncandle-power fitted up in the carriages of the main line trains. They\r\nare placed at the backs of the seats just above the passengers’ head.\r\nWhen anyone wishes to make use of one of these lamps, he places a penny\r\nin a slot, and then, on pressing a knob, the light appears, and at the\r\nend of half an hour it is automatically extinguished; but, of course, it\r\ncan again be made to appear by another penny dropped in the slot, and so\r\non every half-hour as long as may be required.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the electric light (whether arc or incandescent) quite\r\nsteady, the greatest uniformity in the speed of the dynamo is essential;\r\nand if the prime mover by which it is worked, whether steam-engine,\r\ngas-engine, water-wheel, or turbine, is not perfectly regular in its\r\naction, the lights will fluctuate in brightness, and thus produce an\r\neffect which is very unpleasant. This is entirely obviated by the\r\nadjunct we have now to describe, which not only is most efficient as a\r\nregulator, but is, moreover, of still more importance by also providing\r\nthe means of storing up the electrical energy in a portable form. The\r\nreader will have understood that in a voltaic cell the production of an\r\nelectric current is the concomitant of a chemical union of substances\r\nwithin the cell (p. 493). Now, in the experiment shown in Fig. 263 (p.\r\n498), it is the reverse of combination—namely, the decomposition of the\r\nwater that is supposed to be effected under the influence of the current\r\nfrom a galvanic battery, and the poles are so connected that the\r\ndirection of the current in the liquid while the decomposition is\r\nproceeding is from the wire in the O tube to that in the H tube. If the\r\nexperiment be interrupted by removing the battery, and then putting a\r\ngalvanometer (Fig. 258) in its place, the galvanometer will immediately\r\nindicate a current passing through the apparatus in a direction the\r\n_reverse_ of the former one—that is, in the liquid it goes from H to O,\r\nand the volumes of the gases will slowly diminish while water is\r\nreproduced by imperceptible and gradual re-combination. Batteries can be\r\nmade by joining up a series of arrangements like Fig. 263, consisting of\r\nnothing but strips of platinum surrounded by hydrogen and oxygen gases\r\nand the intervening acidified water. Analogous results are obtainable by\r\ncells containing other compounds with suitable metallic poles, for when\r\ndecomposition has been effected through a series of such cells by a\r\nsufficiently powerful current from a _primary_ battery, the series of\r\ncells will constitute, on removal of the primary battery, a _secondary_\r\nbattery, for when the terminals of this are joined, the current will\r\nflow in the reversed direction while the separated parts of the original\r\ncompounds are re-combining within the cells. These _secondary_ batteries\r\nare called also _polarisation_ batteries. A form of secondary battery\r\nwas contrived some years ago (1859) by M. Gaston Planté, in which the\r\ncurrent of the primary battery was made to act on plates of lead\r\nimmersed in dilute sulphuric acid. The effect was to coat one of the\r\nlead plates of each pair with lead oxide; and in the action of the\r\nsecondary battery this was reversed, and the plates gradually returned\r\nto their original condition, when, of course, the current ceased. Some\r\nimprovements were made in the Planté battery by Faure, who coated one of\r\na pair of very thin lead plates at once with a film of red oxide of\r\nlead, and used a layer of felt to separate it from the other plate. Such\r\narrangements have been called “accumulators”; another term applied to\r\nthem is “storage batteries”; but it is not to be supposed that in them\r\nelectricity is stored or, so to speak, bottled up. They consist merely\r\nof such an arrangement of materials as that when a current (_direct_,\r\nnot alternating) from a dynamo is passing, certain substances are placed\r\nin a position of chemical separation in such a manner that in\r\nre-combining an equable current of electricity is produced in the\r\nconductor externally uniting them. We need not notice some slight\r\nmodifications of the Faure cells that have been lately introduced, as no\r\nnew principle is involved. The light of incandescent lamps worked by the\r\nFaure accumulator is perfectly free from the fluctuations which may\r\nusually be noticed when the lamps are directly connected with the dynamo\r\nonly. Even if the engine should stop altogether, the light may be\r\nmaintained for hours. The accumulator has also the advantage of giving\r\nout the electric energy that may have been imparted to it days before;\r\nso that when a house is fitted up with an independent electric light\r\ninstallation, there is no necessity for running the dynamo all the time\r\nthe lamps are in use, as two or three days weekly may suffice to charge\r\nall the accumulators. Then there is the portability of the accumulator,\r\nwhich permits electrical energy to be made use of in situations where\r\ndynamos and prime movers would be impossible. It is said that a large\r\nFaure cell weighing about 140 lbs. can receive and give out energy equal\r\nto one horse power for one hour. In the arrangement for the reading\r\nlamps in railway carriages referred to above, accumulators are placed\r\nunder the seats; and it need hardly be said that when the electric light\r\nhas been seen in a _coiffure_, a small Faure cell concealed about the\r\nwearer’s person has supplied the current. A very interesting and useful\r\napplication of the accumulator is the portable electric light lamp for\r\nminers made by the Edison-Swan Company. It is simply an incandescent\r\nlamp protected by a strong glass cover attached to the side of a\r\ncylindrical case containing a four-celled accumulator. This lamp is\r\nprovided with an ingenious contrivance by which the circuit would be\r\ninterrupted, if by accident the outer glass cover of the lamp were\r\nbroken. Let us now see what another new development of the applications\r\nof electricity gains by the use of accumulators by turning our attention\r\nto the _electro-motor_.\r\n\r\nAt the Vienna Exhibition of 1873, the Gramme Company showed two of their\r\nmachines, and it is said that when one of these machines was at rest, a\r\nworkman connected the ends of two covered copper wires with the other\r\nmachine, thinking that these were placed to carry the current from that\r\nmachine when in movement. Everybody was surprised when, without any\r\npower from the machinery, the ring was soon in rapid rotation. These\r\nwires were in fact joined up to the other Gramme machine which was\r\nalready in action, and it was the current from this that set the former\r\nin motion. There is no reason why this story should not be perfectly\r\ntrue, although there are good reasons for believing that the\r\n_electro-motor_ was the result of no such accidental circumstance. The\r\nattractions and repulsions between the poles of electro-magnets was soon\r\nseen to supply an available source of motive power, and the subject has\r\nbeen already mentioned on page 518. Professor Jacobi, of St. Petersburg,\r\nseems to have been the first who constructed an electro-magnetic engine,\r\nthe exciting power being the current supplied by a voltaic battery. This\r\nwas in 1834, and in a few years afterwards the Professor applied his\r\nengine to a small paddle-wheel boat, 28 feet long, which was\r\nelectrically propelled for several days, but at a slow speed. The engine\r\nin this case was virtually a magneto-electric machine worked backwards,\r\nthat is, instead of applying power to turn the machine and so produce a\r\ncurrent of electricity, the current was supplied by the battery and\r\nproduced power. In 1850, an electro-motor of five horse power was shown\r\nby an American, Mr. Page, the principle of which may be illustrated by\r\nsupposing a reversal of the action represented in Fig. 271, thus: if,\r\ninstead of producing currents by moving the magnet, C, in and out of the\r\ncoil, A B, we substitute a battery for D, we can, by alternating the\r\ndirection of the current through the coil, cause a reciprocating motion\r\nof the magnet, C, and this again may be described as a magneto-electric\r\nmachine worked backward. It was soon recognized that no practical\r\nelectro-motor was adequate to the production of such high powers as the\r\nsteam engine supplies, and that the cost must necessarily many times\r\nexceed that of steam power. But certain advantages, nevertheless,\r\npertained to the electro-motor in certain positions, as instance in\r\nsafety, and where a small force only was occasionally required. Now,\r\nwhen the Gramme machine was invented to supply currents of electricity\r\nunder conditions much more favourable than the magneto-electric machines\r\nit superseded, and at a cost vastly less than that of any voltaic\r\nbattery, it is highly improbable that the relation of the new current\r\ngenerator to the production of electro-motive power would long be\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nThe electro-motor may, therefore, be considered simply as a dynamo\r\nworked backward, and almost any form of dynamo may in this way be used\r\nas an electro-motor, that is, a current being supplied either from a\r\nbattery or from a dynamo, the motor converts the electrical energy into\r\nmechanical energy. Any dynamo that supplies a direct and continuous\r\ncurrent can thus be used; but there are certain conditions which make it\r\ndesirable to somewhat modify the proportions and arrangement of the\r\nseveral parts when the machine is for motor purposes.\r\n\r\nIn general, any source of current may be used, but in the applications\r\nof the electro-motor there are chiefly two methods in practice of\r\nsupplying the current. The one takes the current from a dynamo in\r\nmotion, the other from an accumulator which has previously been\r\n“charged” by a dynamo.\r\n\r\nBoth of these methods are used in the familiar and interesting\r\napplication of the electro-motor to the propulsion of carriages on\r\ntramways and railways. For the latter, indeed, an attempt was made\r\nhalf-a-century ago on the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway, to employ the\r\nforce of an electro-magnetic machine actuated by a battery. This was in\r\n1842, and although this electric locomotive was fitted up completely, it\r\ndid not attain a speed of more than four miles an hour. The weight with\r\nthe batteries, carriage, etc., exceeded five tons. But in the recent\r\ninventions which have been in practical operation in many places, it is\r\nfound quite easy to dispense with any current producer on the electric\r\nlocomotive itself, for the electricity is supplied by a fixed dynamo and\r\nthe current is transmitted along the line by a conductor from which a\r\nsliding contact conveys it to the electro-motor, which is attached to\r\nthe framework of the carriage and acts on the driving axles of the\r\nwheels directly or by toothed gear. In such cases the return current is\r\ncarried either by another conductor or by the rails themselves. In\r\nanother arrangement one rail conveys the current to the locomotive and\r\nthe other returns it. When the rails are so used they have, of course,\r\nto be insulated from the ground and laid with special electrical contact\r\npieces joining their consecutive lengths, and all the carriage wheels\r\nhave to be insulated, so that the currents shall flow only through the\r\ncoils of the electro-motor. A railway on this system has been worked at\r\nBerlin for some time, and a short tramway on the same plan has lately\r\nbeen opened at Brighton. The Bessborough and Newry Electric Railway\r\n(Ireland) uses a single separate conductor three miles long, and the\r\npower is supplied at a very small cost from a dynamo station near the\r\nmiddle of the line, where water power is taken advantage of to drive a\r\nlarge turbine. Quite recently electric propulsion has been adopted on\r\nsome of the short tunnel lines in London, and it is quite probable that\r\nultimately the system will be adopted throughout the whole course of the\r\nunderground railways, with the view of obtaining a purer and more\r\nagreeable atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_i_.—_Poles with Single Arms for Suburban, Roads.—The Ontario\r\n    Beach Railway, Rochester, N. Y._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA very light electric railway has been designed, in which the cars run\r\nalong rails attached to posts at such a height above the ground as may\r\nbe required to make the line level, or with only slight gradients. The\r\nrails also serve as conductors. This is known as the telepherage system,\r\nand it is found to be well adapted for light loads in an undulating\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_j_.—_The Glynde Telepherage Line, on the system of the late\r\n    Fleeming Jenkin._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe other plan which makes use of accumulators commends itself for\r\napplication to ordinary tramway carriages, because no conductors are\r\nrequired along the line, and each car can move independently. The chief\r\nobjection is the great weight of the accumulators and the space they\r\noccupy, although they are usually placed under the seats without much\r\ninconvenience. There are at present (January, 1890) six electric\r\ntramcars running in London, and the accumulator system would no doubt\r\nhave been applied largely as the motive power for the ordinary street\r\nomnibus, but for the difficulty of controlling them under the momentum\r\nof the great mass of the accumulators, etc. The same objection lies\r\nagainst the use of the accumulators and motors for propelling tricycles,\r\nalthough such machines have really been used. But accidents such as\r\noccasionally happen to such vehicles would be attended with additional\r\nrisks of injury from the acids of the secondary battery, etc. But there\r\nis one mode of using electric propulsion, that is free from every\r\nobjection and, indeed, offers great advantages. Only two years ago the\r\nfirst electric boat on the Thames was tried experimentally between\r\nRichmond and Henley, and the result was entirely in favour of the\r\nelectric over the steam launch. The Faure battery, or so-called “storage\r\ncells,” are arranged beneath the floor of the boat for most of its\r\nlength in the smaller boats, and the electro-motor is directly coupled\r\nwith the screw shaft. The electric launch has these advantages: perfect\r\nsafety, freedom from dirt and smoke, no thumping or vibrating, no noise\r\nof steam discharge, or smell of hot oil, no engineer or stoker is\r\nrequired, and much larger space available for passengers. One of these\r\nelectric launches, not going full speed, is able to travel sixty miles\r\nwithout having the accumulators recharged. A considerable number of\r\nthese launches are already in use, and many more are in course of\r\nconstruction. They are made of all sizes, from the smallest to those\r\nthat will carry quite a large company, and may be used for excursion\r\nparties on the river. The description of one of these last states that\r\nshe is 65 feet in length, and 10 feet across the beam. She can carry\r\nsixty passengers, and twenty can dine in the saloon at one time. There\r\nare lavatories, pantries, dressing rooms, etc., and a brass railed upper\r\ndeck, with an awning. At night this boat is lighted up with electric\r\nglow-lamps, the current for these also being supplied by the\r\naccumulators. The Electric Launch Company has stations with Gramme\r\nmachines at work to charge cells ready to replace exhausted ones at\r\nseveral places, namely Hampton, Staines, Maidenhead, Boulter’s Lock,\r\nHenley, Reading and Oxford. There is every prospect of a general\r\nextension of the electric propulsion of boats, and visitors to the\r\nElectrical Exhibition at Edinburgh, in 1890, will find electric launches\r\ntaking holiday makers as far as Linlithgow. The boats will be like those\r\non the Thames, fitted with the Immisch motor. Some electricians are now\r\nsanguine enough to believe that even for large vessels electricity will\r\nyet be able to compete with steam in special cases.\r\n\r\nThe modes of using electric propulsion that we have just noticed furnish\r\na very interesting chain of conversions of one form of force into\r\nanother, with a reversal of the order of transformation at a certain\r\npoint. Let us begin with the carbonic acid gas that existed in the\r\natmosphere of the carboniferous geological period. The solar emanations\r\nwere absorbed, and used by the leaves of the plants to separate the two\r\nelements of the gas,—the plant retaining the one in its substance and\r\nreturning the other to the air. The plant becomes coal; and ages\r\nafterwards the particles of the two separated elements are ready to\r\nre-unite and give out in the form of heat all the energy that was\r\nabsorbed by their separation. This heat is in the steam-engine converted\r\ninto the energy of mechanical power. This mechanical power is in the\r\ndynamo expended in moving copper wires through a magnetic field. Every\r\nschoolboy who has played with a common steel magnet—and what boy has\r\nnot?—knows that the space immediately round the magnet is the seat of\r\nstrange attractive and repulsive force, for he has felt their pulls and\r\npushes on pieces of iron or steel. This mysterious space is the magnetic\r\nfield, and although a person would not be able to perceive that\r\nmechanical force is expended when he moves a single copper ring across\r\nsuch a field, he will readily become conscious of the fact when he moves\r\na number at once that form a closed circuit; and he should not omit the\r\nopportunity of feeling this for himself if he is allowed to turn the\r\nhandle of such a machine as that represented in Figs. 275 or 277. The\r\nmechanical power is absorbed in the dynamo because the movement induces\r\nan electric current that would of itself produce motion in the machine\r\nin the opposite direction. However, the electricity induced by magnetism\r\nand motion is made to pass through the Faure cell or accumulator, when\r\nit does chemical work by separating oxide of lead from sulphuric acid,\r\nleaving these substances in a position to unite together again, when\r\nthis action produces a reverse current of electricity through an\r\nexternal metal circuit. The coils of the electro-motor form this\r\ncircuit; the electricity induces magnetism, and the magnetism gives rise\r\nto visible motion and mechanical power.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been already said, it will be obvious that a pair of\r\ncovered copper wires connecting a dynamo with an electro-motor becomes a\r\nvery convenient means of _carrying power_ from one place to another.\r\nThere are situations in which shafts, belts, or any other mechanical\r\nexpedients are troublesome or impossible to use for this purpose. For\r\ninstance, a dynamo working at the mouth of a tunnel or coal-pit may be\r\nmade to drive any machinery within with nothing between but the\r\nmotionless wires. Or a single dynamo will supply moderate power to a\r\nnumber of small workshops, provided each has an electro-motor, with no\r\nother connection than a pair of copper wires. This arrangement is found\r\nvery advantageous for light work and where power is required\r\noccasionally, as in watch-making, the manufacture of philosophical\r\ninstruments, etc. Such moderate power is occasionally in demand also in\r\nprivate houses, to drive sewing machines, lathes, etc.; and it is\r\nobtainable from the same source as the current for lighting. Private\r\ninstallations for lighting purposes usually have a dynamo driven by a\r\ngas engine, and working into a set of accumulators. It seems not a\r\nlittle remarkable that if the gas were burnt in the ordinary way instead\r\nof being used in the gas engine, it would give only a fraction of the\r\namount of the light it causes to be given out by the electric light\r\nlamps. But at the present time, houses and business premises are\r\nsupplied with electricity by companies who carry electric mains through\r\nthe streets. In England these electric mains, which are thick insulated\r\ncopper wires, are inclosed in iron pipes and laid beneath the pavement,\r\nlike the gas mains. In the United States, where electric illumination is\r\nmuch used, the conductors have been usually carried overhead like\r\ntelegraph wires, but not a few fatal accidents have occurred from these\r\nconductors falling into the streets. There is no reason to doubt but\r\nthat in a short time it will be as common for households to draw upon\r\nsuch electric mains for their supply of light and power as it now is to\r\ndraw gas and water from common mains. The electric supply companies have\r\ncentral stations in suitable positions, where very large and powerful\r\ndynamos are regularly driven by steam power. These stations are provided\r\nwith appliances for measuring the currents and for duly controlling the\r\nenergy sent out. What will appear very extraordinary when we remember\r\nthat electricity is in itself unknown, is that the quantity supplied to\r\neach house or establishment can be actually measured, and is paid for by\r\nmeter as in the case of gas. As already said (page 498) electricity can\r\nonly be measured by its effects, and it is the chemical effect which it\r\nis found convenient to use for the purpose we are speaking of. The plan\r\nis simply this: two plates of zinc dip into a solution of sulphate of\r\nzinc, and from the one to the other there is sent through the solution\r\none-thousandth part of the current to be measured. While the current\r\npasses, zinc is deposited on the plate towards which the current goes in\r\nthe solution, and if this plate is periodically weighed this furnishes\r\nthe measure of the total current. But how is just one-thousandth of the\r\nwhole current taken off from the rest and made to circulate through the\r\nmeasuring apparatus? This is very easily done by taking advantage of the\r\nlaw of derived circuits, which for our present purpose may be stated\r\nthus: when a current of electricity finds two different circuits along\r\nwhich it can pass, it will divide and circulate through both of them,\r\nbut the greater part will pass through the circuit of less resistance\r\n(if there be any inequality), and by adjusting the resistances of the\r\ncircuits we can divide the current between the two partial or derived\r\ncircuits in any required proportions. Electric resistances, it may be\r\nmentioned, depend upon the length, section, and nature of the conductor,\r\nand are very easily measured and adjusted.\r\n\r\nWhile the method just explained serves very well to measure the quantity\r\nof electricity that has passed through a conductor in a given period,\r\nprovided that the current has always been in the same direction, it will\r\nbe sufficiently obvious that it would fail altogether in the case of\r\nalternating currents. And, in fact, even in the case supposed this mode\r\nof measurement does not take account of the real energy set in motion. A\r\nreference to page 498, where the differences of electric currents are\r\nmentioned that are commonly spoken of—_tension_ and _quantity_—will show\r\nthat electric effects depend upon more than the _quantity_ of\r\nelectricity passing. Forms of apparatus have been devised for recording\r\nthe total energy supplied; but their construction and principles are too\r\ncomplex to be here explained. In some cases high tension currents are\r\nrequired, in others it is quantity and not tension that is sought for;\r\nand there are ways of transforming the qualities of currents so that the\r\nsame source shall supply electricity of either class. An example of this\r\nmay have been noticed in the action of the Ruhmkorff coil, where the\r\nmere interruption of the primary or battery circuit, which possesses so\r\nlittle tension that of itself it could not give rise to a spark,\r\nnevertheless produces a wave of electricity in the secondary circuit of\r\na tension so high that sparks several feet long may be produced by it.\r\n\r\nA somewhat recent application of the electric current of the dynamo may\r\nbe just mentioned here. It is what is known as electrical welding, and\r\ndepends upon the heat developed by currents being proportioned to the\r\nelectrical resistance for each part of the circuit. The heat thus\r\ngenerated, where the current passes between two surfaces of metal, even\r\nof considerable dimensions, is sufficient to bring them to a semi-fluid\r\ncondition, so that when simply pressed together they coalesce into one\r\nmass. In this way pieces of iron work can be welded together in\r\nsituations where it would be either inconvenient or impossible to heat\r\nthem by furnaces.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has followed the last article will probably be prepared\r\nto admit that “the magnetic field” is one of the most wonderful things\r\nin the whole realm of inorganic nature, as all the powerful effects we\r\nhave been describing are the results of merely moving wires through it.\r\nA wire conveying an electrical current so modifies the space surrounding\r\nit, or so acts upon the unknown pervading medium, that conductors moved\r\nin it, have other currents generated in them. An intermittent current,\r\nlike that in the primary circuit of the induction coil, is equivalent to\r\na movement of the magnetic field in regard to the secondary coil, so\r\nthat the general principle in the coil and the dynamo is fundamentally\r\nthe same. Quite recently, Professor Elihu Thomson has shown some very\r\nnovel mechanical effects of repulsions and rotations of conductors\r\nplaced near the poles of a coil through which rapidly alternating\r\ncurrents are passing. [1890.]\r\n\r\nWe already hear of natural forces which have hitherto in a manner run to\r\nwaste being now utilised in man’s service by the advantage taken of the\r\ncapability of a slender wire to convey power. A notable instance is in\r\nthe case of the famous Falls of Niagara. Here the head of water is used\r\nto drive turbines; our readers must not run away with any notion of huge\r\nwater-wheels being placed below the falls. But from the high level of\r\nthe water above the falls a tunnel has been cut which brings the water\r\ninto pipes 7½ feet in diameter, and these deliver it into three\r\nturbines, in passing through which it develops a force of 5,000 horse\r\npower, and this force is communicated to a steel shaft 2½ feet in\r\ndiameter, connected with the revolving parts of the dynamo. Mr. G.\r\nForbes, the engineer, states that the company who have undertaken this\r\nenterprise are supplying, with a handsome profit to themselves,\r\nelectrical current or power at ⅛th of a penny per unit, for which\r\nEnglish companies charge sixpence. That is, Niagara supplies power at\r\n1/48th of the price it can be obtained from coal.\r\n\r\nThe fact that mechanical power can be brought from a distance to\r\neveryone’s door by a slender wire, and at small cost, suggests the\r\npossibility of great social and industrial changes being effected in the\r\nfuture by that one condition. Think of the abolition of factory chimneys\r\nand smoke, nay, even of the abolition of the factory system itself, for\r\ncheap power transmission seems to promise much in that direction, and\r\nthere is a shadowing forth of still more in\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _THE NEW ELECTRICITY._\r\n\r\nThe Leyden jar and a few of its most obvious and common effects have\r\nbeen touched upon already, (page 490); but the phenomena which are\r\nrevealed by a careful study of its charge and discharge show that these\r\nare by no means of the simple kind that has generally been supposed.\r\nThus, for instance, if the magnetising effects of what is called current\r\nelectricity be borne in mind, especially the _definiteness_ of this\r\naction as regards the _direction_ of the current (_cf._ Fig. 257), it\r\nwould follow that if instead of the iron bar in Fig. 265 we place within\r\nthe coil some unmagnetised steel needles we should find after passing a\r\ncurrent or discharge that these have become converted into permanent\r\nmagnets, and that their north poles are always towards the left of the\r\nsupposed current. Years ago experiments were made to ascertain whether\r\nthe discharges of a Leyden jar repeatedly passed through a coil would\r\nmagnetise needles in the same way, because it had been assumed that the\r\ndischarge is simply a current of extremely short duration and of quite\r\ndefinite direction. As far back as 1824 it had, however, been observed\r\nthat the needles were magnetised sometimes in the wrong direction, yet\r\nno attempt was made to explain this—it was sometimes merely mentioned in\r\nthe books as “anomalous magnetisation.” Dr. Henry of Washington, U.S.A.,\r\nexperimented on the subject, and in 1842 referred this action to a\r\ncondition of the discharge which had never before been suggested. He\r\nsays “we must admit _the existence of a principal discharge in one\r\ndirection, and then several reflex actions backward and forward, each\r\nmore feeble than the preceding, until the equilibrium is obtained_.”\r\nSome five years afterwards Helmholtz had independently arrived at the\r\nsame conclusion, and from the fact that when a _succession_ of Leyden\r\njar discharges are sent through the voltameter (Fig. 263) the water is\r\nindeed decomposed, but _both_ oxygen and hydrogen are evolved at _each_\r\nelectrode. Sir William Thomson (now Lord Kelvin) examined the question\r\nfrom a theoretical point of view, and in a masterly mathematical paper\r\npublished by him in 1853 not only showed that the discharge must be of\r\nan oscillating character, but gave the form of equation by which the\r\nrate of oscillation is determined.\r\n\r\nFaraday proved, as has already been stated, that the matter of the\r\ndielectric takes part in such condensing actions as that of the Leyden\r\njar. The electrical charge enters into the glass, the particles of which\r\nare thrown into a certain state of strain or tension (which Faraday\r\ncalled polarisation), and the discharge of the jar is their release from\r\nthat tension. So that it appears that whatever electricity may be, it\r\ncan in some way become bound up with the particles of ordinary matter\r\nlike glass and other dielectrics, and exert force upon them, which force\r\nacts always in two opposite directions. It is the opposition of the form\r\nor direction in which the electrical effect is manifested that gave rise\r\nto the conception of the two “fluids”—the “positive” and the “negative.”\r\nIf these “fluids” really existed it would surely have been possible to\r\ngive to an insulated body an absolute charge of either of them. But this\r\ncan never be done; if, for instance, you have in the middle of a room a\r\nmetallic sphere charged with positive electricity, the necessary\r\ncondition is that on the walls of the apartment or on surrounding\r\nobjects there is an exactly equivalent quantity or negative electricity.\r\n\r\nThe number of oscillations or alternate momentary currents in a single\r\ndischarge of a Leyden jar is enormous. Theory shows that under ordinary\r\ncircumstances they must be enumerated by hundreds of thousands, if not\r\nby millions; that is, the apparently instantaneous spark is really made\r\nup of say a million surgings to and fro of the electric influence. But\r\ntheory also shows that the frequency of these oscillations can be\r\ncontrolled or adjusted through an indefinite range. A general notion of\r\nthe requisite conditions may be obtained by the analogy of sound, and\r\nfor this we may take the familiar case of the strings of a musical\r\ninstrument, say the violin, or the harp. Everybody knows that when a\r\nstretched string or wire is pulled a little aside it is in a state of\r\nlateral strain, striving by its elastic force to return to its position\r\nof rest, and if it is suddenly let go it not only rapidly regains that\r\nposition, but by the inertia of its motion is carried beyond it against\r\nits elastic force, which, however, again brings it back, and the\r\nmovement is continued nearly up to the point at which it was originally\r\nreleased, this swinging movement persisting for an indefinite period,\r\nduring which the vibrations, which have an ascertainable and perfectly\r\nregular frequency, are communicated to the sounding-board of the\r\ninstrument and from that to the air, by which they are conveyed to the\r\near and affect the auditor as a musical note, which note is higher as\r\nthe number of vibrations per second is greater. Everybody will have\r\nobserved that in the violin the note yielded by each open string is\r\nhigher as the tension becomes greater by turning the peg to tighten it;\r\nthat the same string will, without any change in its tension, yield\r\nhigher notes as shorter lengths of it are employed. Another circumstance\r\nupon which the pitch of the note depends may also be illustrated in the\r\nviolin, in which it will be noted that the G string, which gives the\r\nlowest notes, is loaded with wire wound spirally round it. Here, then,\r\nare three circumstances that collectively determine the pitch or number\r\nof vibrations of a string—tension, length, weight; and if you give the\r\nmeasures of these to a mathematician he can tell you the note the string\r\nwill emit, for the number of vibrations is given (when the measures are\r\nexpressed in the proper units) by the formula\r\n\r\n                                     _√t_\r\n                              _n_ = ——————\r\n                                    _2l√w_\r\n\r\nThis shows that we have only to adjust suitably the tension, length, and\r\nweight of a string in order to make it vibrate at any rate we please.\r\nNow in the oscillation of currents in the Leyden jar discharge there are\r\nconditions which correspond, by analogy at least, with those that\r\ndetermine the vibrations of a stretched string. These conditions are of\r\ncourse electrical, and they are definable in terms of electric units,\r\nwhich need not be discussed here. As we are leading the reader to the\r\nmodern view of electricity, which sets aside the fluid theories and\r\nregards electricity as having no separate existence, but as being merely\r\nthe manifestation of some condition of a universally pervading medium,\r\nthe same, in fact, as the luminiferous ether, it is curious to remark\r\nthat these electrical oscillations would seem to attribute to the\r\nincompressible and imponderable ether something very much like the\r\ncharacteristic property of matter we call inertia, by virtue of which\r\nthe released cord flies past its position of equilibrium to the other\r\nside. Or may this quality be dependent on the matter of the dielectric\r\nin which the ether is, as it were, entangled?\r\n\r\nThe oscillatory character of the Leyden jar discharge was elegantly\r\ndemonstrated before a large audience in a lecture given by Professor O.\r\nLodge at the Royal Institution a few years ago. Clearly it is impossible\r\nto render perceptible to the senses the millions of periodic discharges\r\nthat take place in the marvellously short space of time taken up by a\r\nspark, but by doing what is analogous to slackening the tension of the\r\nstretched string or increasing its length, that is by increasing the\r\n_static capacity_, which means using a large number of jars combined\r\ninto a battery, and at the same time causing the discharge to pass\r\nthrough coils (the effect of these is to increase the _self-induction_\r\nof the circuit—called also _impedance_), an arrangement corresponding\r\nwith loading the string, Dr. Lodge was able to bring down the rate of\r\noscillation to 5,000 per second, when, instead of the crack of the\r\nordinary discharge, a very shrill continuous sound was heard. The\r\naddition of another coil gave another load, and when the rate was thus\r\nreduced to about 500, the note emitted was that of the C above the\r\nmiddle A of the piano. With the rate of oscillation thus reduced, it\r\nbecame easy to render the discontinuity of the discharge visible by\r\nmeans of revolving mirrors, as in the well-known acoustical\r\ndemonstrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_k_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nProfessor Lodge has devised an experiment which again shows the analogy\r\nof electrical oscillations with those by which sound is produced. It is\r\nwell known that a vibrating tuning-fork will set another fork of the\r\nsame pitch to vibrate also by mere approximation. A and B (Fig. 280_k_)\r\nare two exactly similar Leyden jars, the inner and outer coatings of\r\neach being connected by a wire enclosing a considerable area in its\r\ncircuit, which in the case of A contains an air gap across which sparks\r\npass when the coatings are connected with the poles of an electrical\r\nmachine. The circuit of B is provided with an adjustable sliding piece\r\nC, and the coatings are almost connected with each other by a strip of\r\ntinfoil hanging over the rim but not quite reaching to the outer\r\ncoating. When the jars are placed so that their wire circuits are\r\nparallel, and sparks are passing across the air interval of A’s circuit,\r\na position of the slider on the other can be found when sparks also pass\r\nbetween the tin-foil and the outer coating. But if the slider be moved\r\nfrom this position, the two circuits will no longer be in unison, and\r\nthe sparks in B will cease. This response of the oscillations in one jar\r\nto those set up in another of the same vibratory period is called\r\n_electrical resonance_.\r\n\r\nDr. Hertz, a professor in the University of Bonn, has opened out new\r\npaths to investigators by a brilliant series of researches which have\r\nshown that in the dielectric surrounding an electrical system executing\r\nvery rapid oscillations there are waves of electro-motive and magnetic\r\nforce. These researches are not capable of any condensed description\r\nhere, and the reasoning is of a kind that appears mainly to the expert\r\nphysicist. One of his modes of investigation required oscillations of\r\nextreme rapidity, and he obtained them by attaching to each pole of an\r\ninduction coil a metal plate, and between these plates, which were in\r\nthe same vertical plane, passed a stout wire interrupted by an air gap\r\nin its centre provided with small brass balls. The rate of oscillation\r\nof this arrangement was calculated as the hundred-millionth part of 1·4\r\nsecond. In conjunction with this system Hertz made use of a very simple\r\napparatus he called a resonator, which consisted merely of a piece of\r\ncopper wire bent into a circle of about 28 inches diameter. The ends of\r\nthe wire did not, however, meet, but were fitted with two balls, or with\r\na ball and a point, and an arrangement by which the air gap between them\r\ncould be very finely adjusted and measured. This resonator was, of\r\ncourse, prepared as to be in electrical tune with the original vibrator,\r\nand with it Hertz was able to examine the condition of the surrounding\r\nspace. When held in the hand near the vibrator he found that sparks\r\ncrossed the air space in the resonator, and that the length of the air\r\nspace across which the sparks would pass varied with the position of the\r\nresonator. When the plane of the resonator was parallel with the metal\r\nplanes of the vibrator and its axis in the horizontal line drawn\r\nperpendicularly through the vibrator’s air space, the sparks passed\r\nreadily when the air space of the resonator was at the same time\r\nvertically above or below its centre, but they ceased entirely when it\r\nwas level with the centre. He obtained these sparks when the resonator\r\nwas held—in free space, be it understood—in the above-mentioned position\r\neven at a distance from the vibrator of 13 yds., the length of the\r\napartment. By examining the results with other positions of his\r\nresonator and by other and varied experiments, Hertz was able to prove\r\nthe existence of definite waves of electro-magnetic and electro-motive\r\nforces, to measure their lengths, and to show that they are capable of\r\nreflection, refraction, and even polarization by the same laws that hold\r\nwith the extremely short but enormously rapid vibrations constituting\r\nlight. It may here be mentioned that the existence of currents in the\r\nresonator can be shown by a Geissler tube being made to take the place\r\nof the air space, which tube is thus lighted up without any metallic or\r\nvisible connection with any electrical apparatus whatever, the only\r\nrequisite conditions being that its circuit be tuned to the vibrator,\r\nand in a certain position in relation to the axis of the spark space of\r\nthe latter. Hertz has also shown that electro-magnetic disturbances\r\n(transversal waves) are propagated in space with a determinate velocity\r\nakin to that of light, and in short the outcome of his investigations,\r\nas well as of those undertaken by others, has been a vindication of\r\nClerk Maxwell’s splendid theory by which light is regarded as an\r\nelectro-magnetic action. Professor Righi of Bologna, having succeeded in\r\nobtaining shorter electrical waves than anyone before—namely, 4/10ths of\r\nan inch instead of about 20 inches—was able with them to repeat all the\r\nphenomena of optics such as reflection, refraction, circular\r\npolarization, interference, &c. It appears then almost certain that\r\nlight and electro-magnetic waves or radiations are but one and the same\r\naffection of a pervading medium we call the ether.\r\n\r\nBy following up in certain directions lines of research suggested by the\r\ninvestigations of Maxwell, Lodge, Hertz and others, and by an unreserved\r\nacceptance of the ether theory of light, electricity and magnetism, some\r\nwonderful practical results have recently been obtained by M. Nikola\r\nTesla, an electrical engineer now resident in New York. The experiments\r\nshown by Tesla in his public lectures have excited great interest in\r\nscientific circles, and have by many persons been witnessed with\r\nsomething like astonishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_l_.—_The Tesla Oscillator._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280_m_.—_M. Nikola Tesla._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects of M. Tesla was to obtain alternating currents\r\nof high tension and great frequency. It may be seen from Fig. 272 that\r\nthe movement of coils of wire in a magnetic field generates currents,\r\nand it has been stated that these currents are in alternately opposite\r\ndirections as the coils approach or recede from the magnetic poles. In\r\nthe machine represented in Fig. 280_a_, each revolution would produce 16\r\nreversals of current. Tesla constructed a rotatory machine which gave\r\n20,000 alternations of current in one second, because it had 400 poles\r\nand could be rotated at a very high speed. But of course the number of\r\npoles and the speed of the machine could not be increased beyond certain\r\npractical limits. By a happy application of the known principle of\r\nharmonic oscillations, in which all the rotatory movements of\r\nfly-wheels, coils and poles could be dispensed with, Tesla simplified\r\nthe alternate current generator, reducing the moving parts to the\r\nminimum at the same time that he obtained a greater number of\r\nalternations and almost perfect regularity in their periodicity. The way\r\nin which this has been accomplished may be gathered from a careful\r\ninspection of Fig. 280_l_ compared with the following explanation. This\r\nillustration, it should be understood, is merely a diagram in which\r\ndetails of mechanism are altogether omitted, and only so much shown as\r\nwill serve to explain the principle. We shall take the mechanical part\r\nfirst, and direct the reader’s attention to the means by which an iron\r\nrod is made to perform very rapid to-and-fro movements in the direction\r\nof its length, and to do that with perfectly isochronous periods, which\r\nmay be made longer or shorter at will, and which are quite independent\r\nof very considerable variations in the motive power. The diagram\r\nrepresents the apparatus in section, and the central part of it marked\r\nby letters P and P´ is a piston through which passes what may be called\r\na piston-rod A, which projects some distance out of the cylinder at both\r\nends. The piston is shown in the diagram in its central position, where\r\nthe impelling power has no action to move it as will presently be seen.\r\nThis moving power we may assume to be the compressed air applied through\r\nthe ports I I´. Just to the right of the upper one of these on the\r\ndiagram will be observed in the piston a slot S opening into a hollow T,\r\nwhich communicates directly with the space on the left of the piston.\r\nThe same arrangement, with directions reversed, is seen on the other\r\nside of the piston. If now the piston were pushed a little to the left\r\nof the position shown in the diagram, the compressed air rushing from I\r\nthrough the slot into the opening S T would impel the piston towards the\r\nright, and it would be carried onward by its inertia beyond the position\r\nshown in the figure towards the right, but in doing this the access of\r\nthe compressed air on the left would be cut off, and the slot\r\ncommunicating with the space on the right hand would allow the\r\ncompressed air to act in the space P, checking the further advance of\r\nthe piston to the right, acting like a spring or elastic cushion, and\r\nagain driving the piston to the left, during which movement the air that\r\nhas done its work is allowed to escape at the outlet O O. The same cycle\r\nof operations will be rapidly repeated, but the rate of oscillation\r\nadmits of control, for the larger the air chamber in which the air is\r\ncompressed by the momentum of the piston and rod, the less will it be\r\ncompressed and the less powerfully it will resist, while with a smaller\r\ncapacity of air-chamber the more powerful will be the back spring of the\r\nimprisoned air. On the other hand, the mass that is moved may be\r\nincreased; that is the weight of the rod, &c., may be increased. In any\r\ncase the oscillations will be perfectly regular, because the force which\r\ntends to bring the piston to its position of equilibrium will be always\r\nproportionate to its distance from that point. So that we have here a\r\nrod shooting in and out shuttle-wise with the utmost regularity and with\r\nalmost any desired rapidity, controllable under precisely the like\r\nconditions as the stretched string already mentioned, for as the tension\r\nof the string is the measure of the force with which it strives to\r\nregain its position of equilibrium, so the compression of air in the\r\nchamber behind the piston; and as the loaded string vibrates slower, so\r\nwill the loaded piston. So much for the mechanical part of this machine,\r\nfor we may omit all details of valves, &c. The electrical arrangement is\r\nvery simple and of the greatest efficiency. On each projecting end of\r\nthe piston are wound coils of insulated copper wire, which being shot in\r\nand out across a powerful magnetic field between the jaws of very large\r\nelectro-magnets M M´ cut the “lines of force” to the best advantage, and\r\nfrom these coils alternating currents of high tension and frequency are\r\ngathered up. The vibrating rod is steadied by working in bearings (not\r\nshown). The electro-magnets are actuated as usual by coils of insulated\r\nwire surrounding their iron cores. In the motion of the moving coils\r\nthere are electrical forces called into play which in mechanical effect\r\ncontrol the movement in the same way as the air-springs, and as these\r\nelectrical forces admit of certain adjustments and have calculable\r\neffects, the _mechanical period_ of the machine and the _electrical_ one\r\ncan be made to accord, and thus to, as it were, sustain each other, and\r\nassure a perfectly isochronous periodicity, even with considerable\r\nvariations of the impelling force. Though we have supposed compressed\r\nair as the actuating agent, steam has been applied in some slightly\r\nmodified forms of the machine, and sometimes at the high pressure of 350\r\nlbs. per square inch. Such is Tesla’s alternating current producer, or\r\nthe _Tesla Oscillator_, as it has been called. This, of course, is a\r\nvery different thing from the vibrator of disruptive discharge already\r\nmentioned in connection with the experiments of Professor Hertz. Tesla\r\nalso uses the disruptive discharge, and what with the high frequency and\r\nthe great tension of his currents, he obtains electric oscillations of\r\nhitherto unequalled rapidity, calculable at thousands of millions per\r\nsecond. He claims, indeed, to be able to agitate the ether at rates of\r\nundulation comparable with those of light itself (500 billions per\r\nsecond). Some of the experiments he has shown certainly lend support to\r\nsuch an explanation. The lighting of electric lamps with but one\r\nmetallic connection, and that held in a person’s hand, and causing\r\nGeissler tubes to light up without any metallic connections whatever,\r\nand making gas at ordinary pressures luminous, a lump of charcoal\r\ncontained in a closed glass vessel to become red-hot while the vessel is\r\nmerely held in the hand, are certainly phenomena that cannot be\r\nexplained on the old lines. The space between two large surfaces of\r\nmetal 15 feet apart, and forming the poles of an oscillatory system, is\r\nshown to be full of light-forming influences, as when phosphorescent\r\nsubstances contained in closed glass vessels glow intensely, the glass\r\nbeing apparently no obstacle. According to Tesla, you make space and\r\nmatter equally permeable to ethereal undulations when these are tuned,\r\nso to speak, to the proper frequency.\r\n\r\nMany of the strange effects Tesla has shown are referable to the\r\nprinciple of electric resonance; such are the powers of a coil with no\r\nmetallic connections with any other apparatus and removed, by a distance\r\nof many feet, from any current-conveying wires. Tesla’s workshop was an\r\napartment 40 feet long and 20 wide, and the wires connecting the poles\r\nof his oscillator were carried round the walls, while in the centre of\r\nthe workshop stood a very large but entirely insulated coil, between the\r\nterminals of which an ordinary incandescent lamp was placed. This lamp\r\nwas brilliantly illuminated when the oscillator was in action. The\r\nelectric qualities of this coil were so adjusted that its currents came\r\ninto tune with the ethereal vibrations propagated from the conductor\r\nround the room. But further, a single hoop of copper wire of the proper\r\ndiameter and thickness could be brought into unison with the coil, and\r\nwhen held in the hand over the latter, even at a considerable distance,\r\nincandescent lamps attached to it were lighted up by the induced\r\ncurrents. Many other novel experiments have been shown by M. Tesla, but\r\nthey need not here be described, as they have yet to be connected with\r\nthe logical study of the entire class of phenomena. M. Tesla speaks\r\nsomewhat sanguinely of being ultimately able to convey signals, and even\r\npower, to a distance, not merely with one wire but with no wires at all!\r\nAnother thing he looks forward to is to set the electricity, or rather\r\nthe ether that interpenetrates the matter of the whole earth, into a\r\nstate of agitation. This seems what is commercially termed “a large\r\norder;” but we have seen that every Leyden jar, every coil, and in fact\r\nevery electrical system, has its own period, and if by any possibility\r\nwe could discover, or by chance hit upon the earth’s electric vibration\r\nperiod, it is not antecedently impossible that even the comparatively\r\nsmall efforts of such oscillatory vibrations as we could produce, would\r\nby their accumulation agitate the earth’s ether. It is well known that\r\nvery small impulses, so tuned as to correspond with the natural period\r\nof a considerable mass, will produce striking mechanical effects. Thus,\r\na troop of soldiers passing over a bridge have often been known to break\r\ndown a structure that would have supported their mere weight many times\r\nover, because they were all marching together and with a step\r\ncorresponding in time with the oscillatory period of the bridge. It is\r\nnow always enjoined in the military orders that troops in crossing a\r\nbridge must “break step.” Another familiar illustration of the\r\naccumulation of small synchronous impulses is the experiment of singing\r\ninto a glass goblet the note corresponding with its vibration period.\r\nThe singer merely by sustaining this note for a short time often\r\nsucceeds in shivering the glass into fragments. M. Tesla believes that\r\nhe has already succeeded in agitating the earth’s ether to some extent;\r\nhe does at least obtain flaming purple streamers passing into the air\r\nfrom one end of a coil, while the other is connected with the earth.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries and theories appear likely to lead to many unforeseen\r\nresults, valuable for both science and its applications, and such as may\r\nfar surpass the expectations of those who take less enthusiastic views\r\nof the matter than M. Tesla and his friends do. The theoretical\r\nproperties of the ether and the conditions of it, which are held capable\r\nof making it the scene and the medium of all the hitherto so-called\r\nponderable and imponderable forces, have not been completely worked out.\r\nThe experiments that have been already made show that disturbances of\r\nvery different kinds may be propagated in the ether by undulations of\r\nany length from less than 1/60000th part of an inch, as in the case of\r\nviolet light already spoken of, to the 1,200 miles attributed to certain\r\nelectrical conditions.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sentences, describing the discoveries of Hertz and others,\r\nhad not long been penned before it had become possible to announce that\r\nthey had borne fruit in as extraordinary an invention as could have\r\ndistinguished the close of an extraordinary century. It is the\r\nrealization of what the most accomplished electrician would not long\r\nbefore have pronounced a dream—namely, _wireless telegraphy_. The\r\ngeneral principle of it should not be obscure after the account of the\r\n“Hertzian waves”; but our space does not permit a description of details\r\nof its working out in a practical form by a young Italian electrician,\r\nSignor Marconi. We have already seen that a Geissler tube, when its\r\ncircuit is properly attuned, can be lighted up by the magneto-electric\r\ndisturbance propagated without material contacts, and this itself would\r\nconstitute a method of signalling to a distance. On the same principle,\r\na discharge may be determined by the “wave” between conductors in\r\ncertain adjustable conditions of electric tension, and in this way local\r\ncircuits may be brought into play, and ordinary telegraphic effects\r\nproduced, as described in the following article. The actual apparatus to\r\nreceive the ethereal impulses is extremely simple—merely a little fine\r\nmetallic dust (nickel and silver) in a glass tube included in the\r\nresonator circuit by a wire at each end, touching the dust. This gathers\r\ntogether, or coheres (hence the apparatus is called the _coherer_),\r\nunder the magneto-electric influence, a local battery discharge then\r\npasses, completing a circuit, and the dust has to be shaken loose again\r\nby a mechanical agitation. Marconi has been able to signal over a\r\ndistance of forty-three miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 281.—_Portrait of Professor Morse._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than two centuries ago a learned Italian Jesuit, named Strada, gave\r\na fanciful account of a method by which he supposed two persons might\r\ncommunicate with each other, however far they might be separated. He\r\nconceived two needles magnetized by a loadstone of such virtue, that the\r\nneedles balanced on separate pivots ever afterwards pointed in parallel\r\ndirections; and if one were turned to any point, the other also\r\nsympathetically moved in complete accordance with it. The happy\r\npossessors of these sympathetic needles, each having his needle mounted\r\non a dial marked with the same letters and words similarly inscribed,\r\nwould be able to communicate their thoughts to each other at\r\npreconcerted hours, by movements and pauses of the wonderful needles.\r\nThe poet Akenside, when describing, in his “Pleasures of the\r\nImagination,” the effect of association in bringing ideas before our\r\nminds, illustrates his point by a happy allusion to Strada’s conceit.\r\nHere is the passage:\r\n\r\n          “For when the different images of things,\r\n          By chance combined, have struck the attentive soul\r\n          With deeper impulse, or, connected long,\r\n          Have drawn her frequent eye; howe’er distinct\r\n          The external scenes, yet oft the ideas gain\r\n          From that conjunction an eternal tie\r\n          And sympathy unbroken. Let the mind\r\n          Recall one partner of the various league—\r\n          Immediate, lo! the firm confederates rise.\r\n          ‘Twas thus, if ancient fame the truth unfold,\r\n          Two faithful needles, from the informing touch\r\n          Of the same parent stone, together drew\r\n          Its mystic virtue, and at first conspired\r\n          With fatal impulse quivering to the pole.\r\n          Then—though disjoined by kingdoms, though the main\r\n          Rolled its broad surge betwixt, and different stars\r\n          Beheld their wakeful motions—yet preserved\r\n          The former friendship, and remembered still\r\n          The alliance of their birth. Whate’er the line\r\n          Which one possessed, nor pause nor quiet knew\r\n          The sure associate, ere, with trembling speed,\r\n          He found its path, and fixed unerring there.”\r\n\r\nIn our own day this fancy of Strada’s has been literally and completely\r\nrealized in all save the convenient portability of the sympathetic\r\ndials; but this and the other forms of apparatus which are now so\r\nfamiliar in electric telegraphy were produced by no sudden inspiration\r\noccurring to a single individual. Great inventions are ever the outcome\r\nnot of the labours of one but of a hundred minds, and the progress of\r\nthe electric telegraph might be traced, step by step, from the first\r\nsuggestions, made more than a century ago, of employing, for the\r\ncommunication of intelligence at a distance, the imperfect electric\r\nmeans then known. The men who then attempted to utilize the mysterious\r\nagency of electricity failed to produce a practical telegraph, because\r\nthe conditions of electrical excitation known at that time gave no scope\r\nfor the realization of their project. Not the less do they deserve our\r\ngrateful remembrance for the faith and energy with which they strove to\r\novercome the difficulties of their task. Voltaic electricity was first\r\nproposed as the means of conveying signals to a distance in 1808,\r\nimmediately after the discovery of the power of the pile to decompose\r\nwater; and the method of communicating the signals was based upon this\r\nproperty. Sömmering proposed to arrange thirty-five pairs of electrodes,\r\nformed by gold pins passed through the bottom of a glass vessel\r\ncontaining acidulated water. Each pair of pins was marked by a letter of\r\nthe alphabet or a numeral, and attached to distinct wires, which could\r\nbe put into connection with a pile at the sending station. The signals\r\nwere made by the gas evolved from these electrodes indicating the letter\r\nintended. The number of wires required and the slowness of working were\r\ngreat objections, and this system never came into practical use,\r\nalthough it was afterwards proposed to diminish the number of the wires\r\nfrom thirty-five to two—by so varying the amounts of gas given off and\r\nthe periods of time as to form an intelligible system of signals. Ten or\r\ntwelve years after, Mr. Ronalds, of Hammersmith, invented an ingenious\r\nsystem by which letters on a dial could be pointed out at a distance by\r\nfrictional electricity. Two dials, on which the letters, &c., were\r\nmarked, were each placed behind a screen having an aperture, which\r\npermitted only one letter to be seen at once; and the dial was mounted\r\non the seconds arbor of a clock with a dead-beat escapement. A pair of\r\npith balls hung in front, insulated and connected by means of an\r\ninsulated wire with the similar pair at the other end of the line, where\r\nthe other clock and dial were placed. The clocks were regulated to go as\r\nnearly as possible at the same rate, so that at each end of the line the\r\nsame letters were simultaneously displayed. It was easy, however, at any\r\ntime to start the clocks together at the same letter by a signal\r\npreviously agreed upon, and all that was really required was a\r\nsynchronous motion of the discs during the time the signals were being\r\nsent. The insulated wire received from a small electrical machine a\r\ncharge, which caused the pith balls at both ends to diverge; and the\r\nmoment the wire was discharged, the balls collapsed suddenly and\r\nsimultaneously, and this discharge was effected by the sender of the\r\nmessage at the instant that the letter he wished to indicate appeared at\r\nthe opening in front of his dial. Since the same letter was at the same\r\ninstant visible at the other end also, it was indicated to the receiver\r\nof the message by the collapse of the pith balls. Ronalds worked this\r\ntelegraph experimentally with a wire 525 ft. long, but it was never\r\nadopted practically. On communicating to the Admiralty the power of his\r\ninvention, he was informed that “_telegraphs of any kind were wholly\r\nunnecessary, and no other than the one in use would be adopted_.”\r\n\r\nThe memorable discovery of electro-magnetism by Œrsted in 1819 was soon\r\nfollowed by attempts to apply it to the production of signals at a\r\ndistance. Ampère first pointed out the possibility of making an electric\r\ntelegraph with needles surrounded by wires; but he proposed to have a\r\nseparate needle and wire for each signal to be transmitted. If Ampère\r\nhad but thought of producing signals by different combinations of two\r\nmovements, as Schweigger had before suggested for Sömmering’s telegraph,\r\nthus making two wires and two needles suffice, the practical\r\nintroduction of the electric telegraph would have dated some twenty\r\nyears earlier than it actually did. In 1835 Baron Schilling exhibited an\r\nelectric telegraph with five magnetic needles, and he afterwards\r\nimproved upon it so far as to reduce the number of needles and\r\nconductors to one—for to him the happy thought seems first to have\r\noccurred that one needle could be made to produce many signals by\r\ndifferent combinations of its movements—sometimes to the right,\r\nsometimes to the left. Thus two movements to the left might stand for A,\r\nthree for B, four for C, one to left followed by one to left for D, and\r\nso on. Schilling’s apparatus does not appear to have had the requisite\r\nqualities for practical working on the large scale. From this time,\r\nhowever, telegraphic inventions succeeded each other rapidly, and we\r\nmeet with the names of Gauss, Weber, Steinheil, and others, as inventors\r\nand discoverers in the region of practical science which was now fairly\r\nopened, The first two used the magneto-electric machine to give motion\r\nto the needle; and the thought of using the metals of the railway line\r\nas conductors having occurred to Gauss, he found, on making the attempt,\r\nthat the insulation was imperfect, but he perceived that the great\r\napparent conductibility of the earth would allow of its being\r\nsubstituted for one of the metallic communicators.\r\n\r\nBut the first who succeeded, after long and persevering effort, in\r\ngiving a practical character to the electric telegraph, was undoubtedly\r\nProfessor Wheatstone. He had for some years been engaged in electrical\r\nresearches before, in 1837–-a memorable year for telegraphic\r\ninventions—he took out a patent in conjunction with Mr. W. Fothergill\r\nCooke. In their telegraph there were five magnetic needles, arranged in\r\na horizontal row, each needle being in a vertical position, and the\r\nvarious letters of the alphabet were indicated by the convergence of the\r\nneedles towards the point at which the letter was marked on the dial.\r\nThe first electric telegraph constructed in England was made on this\r\nsystem on the London and Blackwall Railway. In 1838, Messrs. Wheatstone\r\nand Cooke had reduced the number of needles to two, and many other\r\nimprovements were effected in the apparatus for signalling, it being\r\nmade possible for any number of intermediate stations to receive the\r\nmessages. Several great railway companies erected lines with five lines\r\nof wire, but the expense of so many conductors was found to be\r\nconsiderable, and Messrs. Cooke and Wheatstone, after reducing the\r\nnumber of needles and conductors to two, ultimately (1845) patented an\r\ninstrument with a single needle. It was about this time that an incident\r\noccurred which strongly drew the attention of the general public to the\r\nelectric telegraph, which had, up to that time, been considered as the\r\nmore immediate concern of the railway companies. A foul crime had been\r\ncommitted at Salthill, by the murder of a woman named Hart; and Tawell,\r\nthe suspected murderer, was traced to Slough station, and there it was\r\nfound he had taken the train to London; a description of his person was\r\ntelegraphed, with instructions to the police to watch his movements on\r\nhis arrival at Paddington. He was accordingly followed, apprehended,\r\ntried, convicted, and executed. This incident has been graphically and\r\ncircumstantially described by Sir Francis B. Head, in connection with an\r\nanecdote recording a curiously expressed recognition of the value of the\r\ntelegraph in furthering the ends of justice. We give the passage in\r\nfull:\r\n\r\n“Whatever may have been his fears, his hopes, his fancies, or his\r\nthoughts, there suddenly flashed along the wires of the electric\r\ntelegraph, which were stretched close beside him, the following words:\r\n‘A murder has just been committed at Salthill, and the suspected\r\nmurderer was seen to take a first-class ticket for London by the train\r\nwhich left Slough at 7·42 p.m. He is in the garb of a Quaker, with a\r\nbrown great-coat on, which reaches nearly down to his feet. He is in the\r\nlast compartment of the second first-class carriage.’ And yet, fast as\r\nthese words flew like lightning past him, the information they\r\ncontained, with all its details, as well as every secret thought that\r\nhad preceded them, had already consecutively flown millions of times\r\nfaster; indeed, at the very instant that, within the walls of the little\r\ncottage at Slough, there had been uttered that dreadful scream, it had\r\nsimultaneously reached the judgment-seat of Heaven! On arriving at the\r\nPaddington Station, after mingling for some moments with the crowd, he\r\ngot into an omnibus, and as it rumbled along he probably felt that his\r\nidentity was every minute becoming confounded and confused by the\r\nexchange of fellow-passengers for strangers, that was constantly taking\r\nplace. But all the time he was thinking, the cad of the omnibus—a\r\npoliceman in disguise—knew that he held his victim like a rat in a cage.\r\nWithout, however, apparently taking the slightest notice of him, he took\r\none sixpence, gave change for a shilling, handed out this lady, stuffed\r\nin that one, until, arriving at the Bank, the guilty man, stooping as he\r\nwalked towards the carriage door, descended the steps, paid his fare,\r\ncrossed over to the Duke of Wellington’s statue, where, pausing for a\r\nfew moments, anxiously to gaze around him, he proceeded to the Jerusalem\r\nCoffee-house, thence over London Bridge to the Leopard Coffee-house in\r\nthe Borough, and, finally, to a lodging-house in Scott’s Yard, Cannon\r\nStreet. He probably fancied that, by making so many turns and doubles,\r\nhe had not only effectually puzzled all pursuit, but that his appearance\r\nat so many coffee-houses would assist him, if necessary, in proving an\r\n_alibi_; but, whatever may have been his motives or his thoughts, he had\r\nscarcely entered the lodging when the policeman—who, like a wolf, had\r\nfollowed him every step of the way—opening his door, very calmly said to\r\nhim—the words, no doubt, were infinitely more appalling to him even than\r\nthe scream that had been haunting him—‘Haven’t you just come from\r\nSlough?’ The monosyllable, ‘No,’ confusedly uttered in reply,\r\nsubstantiated his guilt. The policeman made him his prisoner; he was\r\nthrown into jail, tried, found guilty of wilful murder, and hanged. A\r\nfew months afterwards, we happened to be travelling by rail from\r\nPaddington to Slough, in a carriage filled with people all strangers to\r\none another. Like English travellers, they were mute. For nearly fifteen\r\nmiles no one had uttered a single word, until a short-bodied,\r\nshort-necked, short-nosed, exceedingly respectable-looking man in the\r\ncorner, fixing his eyes on the apparently fleeting posts and rails of\r\nthe electric telegraph, significantly nodded to us as he muttered aloud,\r\n‘Them’s the cords that hung John Tawell!’”\r\n\r\nSo far we have followed Wheatstone and Cooke, because these gentlemen\r\nwere the first who in any country made the electric telegraph a success\r\non the great scale. Elsewhere than in England, laboratories and\r\nobservatories had been connected by experimental lines, and models had\r\nbeen exhibited to Emperors, but these two Englishmen were the first to\r\nconstruct a telegraph for practical use. It must not, however, be\r\nsupposed that they are entitled to be considered the exclusive inventors\r\nof the electric telegraph, for we have already named other distinguished\r\ninvestigators who contributed their share to this remarkable invention.\r\nAnd some years before Wheatstone and Cooke had patented their first\r\nneedle telegraph, the first ideas of a system which has largely\r\nsuperseded the needles for ordinary telegraphic purposes, had presented\r\nthemselves to a mind capable of developing them into the most efficient\r\nform of telegraphic apparatus which we possess. In October, 1832, among\r\nthe passengers on board the steamship _Sully_, bound from France to the\r\nUnited States, was a talented American artist who had gained some\r\nreputation in his profession. A casual conversation with his\r\nfellow-passengers on electricity, and the plan by which Franklin drew it\r\nfrom the clouds along a slender wire, suggested to the artist the\r\npossibility of thus communicating intelligence by signals at a distance.\r\nHe named his notion to a fellow-passenger, Dr. Jackson, an American\r\nprofessor, who had devoted some attention to electrical science, and\r\nthis gentleman suggested several possible (and impossible) methods in\r\nwhich the thing might, as he thought, be accomplished. None of these\r\nsuggestions, however, indicated the direction in which the idea\r\nafterwards took practical form in Morse’s hands. Jackson had among his\r\nbaggage in the hold, and therefore inaccessible on the voyage, a\r\ngalvanic battery and an electro-magnet, and these he described to the\r\npainter by the aid of rough sketches. When, some years afterwards, Morse\r\nhad realized his ideas of electric communication, and success was\r\nbringing him the favour of fortune, Jackson advanced a claim to a share\r\nin the invention, and a famous lawsuit, Jackson _v._ Morse, was ended by\r\na verdict in favour of Morse, which public and scientific opinion has\r\nunanimously endorsed. In reference to this matter, Mr. R. Sabine, the\r\nauthor of an excellent little treatise on “The History and Progress of\r\nthe Electric Telegraph,” has thus placed the subject in its true light:\r\n\r\n“Two men came together. A seed-word, sown, perhaps, by some purposeless\r\nremark, took root in fertile soil. The one, profiting by that which he\r\nhad seen and read of, made suggestions, and gave explanations of\r\nphenomena and constructions only imperfectly understood by himself, and\r\nentirely new to the other. The theme interested both, and became a\r\nsubject of daily conversation. When they parted, the one forgot or was\r\nindifferent to the matter, whilst the other, more in earnest, followed\r\nit up with diligence, toiling and scheming ways and means to realize\r\nwhat had only been a dream common to both. His labours brought him to\r\nthe adoption of a method not discussed between them, and Morse became\r\nthe acknowledged inventor of a great system. Fame and fortune smiling\r\nupon the inventor, it was natural enough that Jackson, awakening from\r\nhis unfortunate indolence, should remember his share in their earlier\r\ninterchange of ideas, that had, perhaps, first directed Morse’s\r\nattention to the subject of telegraphy. And, although we are compelled\r\nto pronounce dishonest those attempts which Jackson made to claim the\r\nlater and proper invention of Morse—that of the _electro-magnetic\r\nrecorder_—and strong as is our confidence in the spotless integrity of\r\nour friend, we cannot entirely ignore Jackson—little as he has done—nor\r\ndeny him an inferior place amongst those men whose names are associated\r\nwith the history and progress of the electric telegraph in America.”\r\n\r\nFrom the time of this chance conversation with Dr. Jackson, Morse\r\ndevoted his mind entirely to the subject of telegraphic communication,\r\nand although then more than forty years of age, he abandoned the\r\nprofession in which he had already gained some distinction, and with the\r\nenergy and elastic power of adaptability which characterize the American\r\nmind, he gave himself up to this new pursuit to such good purpose, that\r\na few years afterwards saw his telegraph system completely established\r\nin the United States, where the lines now exceed 20,000 miles in length.\r\nAt the instigation of the late Emperor of the French, the Governments of\r\nFrance, Belgium, Holland, Austria, Sweden, Russia, Turkey, and the Papal\r\nStates, combined to award to Professor Morse, in recognition of his\r\nservices to practical science, the sum of £16,000. It was in 1836 that\r\nMorse had first brought his notions into a practical form, but his\r\napparatus has since received many improvements at his own hands, or by\r\nthe useful modifications of it which have been proposed by others. The\r\ntransmitting key invented by Morse has proved a valuable piece of\r\napparatus, and its simplicity has contributed much to the success of his\r\ninvention. Telegraphs on this system were erected in America in 1837,\r\nand the Morse apparatus is now more extensively used than any other in\r\nevery country.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Professor Wheatstone had succeeded in most ingeniously applying\r\nelectro-magnetism in such a manner as actually to realize Strada’s\r\nsympathetic needles, by having the letters of the alphabet arranged\r\nround the circumference of a circle, and pointed at by a revolving hand.\r\nSuch a dial is provided at each end of the line, and the sender of the\r\nmessage has only to make the index of his own dial pause for an instant\r\nat any letter; the hand of his correspondent’s dial will also pause at\r\nthe same letter. These dial telegraphs are particularly convenient for\r\nmany purposes, as they do not require a trained telegraphist to read or\r\nsend the messages. Wheatstone’s plan has been greatly simplified by\r\nBreguet, of Paris, and others, and it is much used in mercantile and\r\npublic establishments. From the foregoing discursive historical\r\nindication of the progress of the electric telegraph we shall now\r\nproceed to describe the systems most commonly employed in practical\r\ntelegraphy, with a brief reference to some other interesting forms; and\r\nin following these descriptions, the reader will find the advantage of\r\nan acquaintance with the electrical facts discussed in the last article,\r\nwith which facts we shall presume he has become to a certain extent\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nIn every telegraphic system there are three distinct portions of the\r\napparatus, which may be separately considered, as they may be variously\r\ncombined. We have—\r\n\r\n1º. The apparatus for producing the electricity, such as batteries,\r\nmagneto-electric machines, &c.\r\n\r\n2º. The conductors, or wires, which convey the electricity.\r\n\r\n3º. The apparatus for sending and for receiving the messages.\r\n\r\nOf the first we shall have little to add to what has been said in the\r\nlast article; and before entering upon the description of the second, it\r\nwill be better to discuss the third division.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _TELEGRAPHIC INSTRUMENTS._\r\n\r\nTelegraphs may conveniently be classed according to the mode in which\r\nthe actions of the sender produce their effect at the point where the\r\nmessage is received. A first class may include those in which the\r\ncurrent is made to deflect magnetized needles; a second may comprise\r\nthose in which the current, by magnetizing soft iron, causes an index to\r\ntravel along a dial and point to the letter intended; a third may\r\nembrace those in which the same action on soft iron is made to print the\r\ndespatches, either in ordinary type or in conventional signs; while in a\r\nfourth class we may put the instruments which give their indications by\r\nsounds only. It is obvious that in some of these systems signs only are\r\nused, and a special training and acquaintance with the symbols is\r\nnecessary, while in the rest the ordinary alphabetic letters are shown\r\nor recorded. In the former case the apparatus is simpler, and therefore\r\nfor the general business of public telegraphy it is almost exclusively\r\nemployed; while for private purposes, where it is often required that\r\nthe messages should be dispatched and received by persons not acquainted\r\nwith the symbolic language, the dial telegraph, or that which prints the\r\nmessage in ordinary characters, will continue to be employed, in spite\r\nof the greater complexity and greater liability to derangement of the\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nIn the needle telegraphs the essential part of the apparatus is a\r\nmultiplier (page 493), having its needle mounted vertically on a\r\nhorizontal axis, to which is also attached an indicator, visible on the\r\nface of the instrument, and formed either of a light strip of wood, or\r\nof another magnetized needle, having its poles placed in the reverse\r\nposition to those of the needle within the coil. When the current is\r\nsent through the latter, the index is deflected to the right or left,\r\naccording to the direction in which the current passes. Fig. 282\r\nrepresents the exterior of one of Wheatstone and Cooke’s double-needle\r\ninstruments, now almost entirely superseded, where needles are used at\r\nall, by the single-needle instrument. The face of the instrument is\r\nmarked with letters and signs, which were supposed to aid the memory of\r\nthe telegraphist, and the movements of the needles were chosen rather\r\nwith that view than any other. We need not here give the code of\r\nsignals, as the double instrument is now obsolete, and the code for the\r\nsingle-needle instrument, which was devised by Wheatstone and Cooke, has\r\nbeen in most cases superseded by one corresponding with the Morse code,\r\na deflection to the right representing a dot, and a deflection to the\r\nleft a dash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 282.—_The Double-Needle Instrument._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe smaller case surmounting the instrument, Fig. 282, contains a bell\r\nor alarum, which serves to call the attention of the clerk at the\r\nreceiving station. The first electric bell-alarum was invented by\r\nWheatstone and Cooke. It was simply a clock alarum, put in motion by a\r\nwound-up spring. The spring was released at the proper moment by a\r\ndetent, which was removed by the attraction of a soft iron armature to\r\nthe core of a small electro-magnet, formed by the line wire itself; but\r\nwhen the current, on account of the length of the line, was too weak to\r\nproduce a sufficiently strong electro-magnet, Wheatstone caused it to\r\nclose the circuit of a local battery. The electric alarum has been\r\nmodified in a thousand ways, and as electric alarums or bells are now\r\ncoming into common use in hotels, and even private houses, we give in\r\nFig. 283 a representation of one of the simplest forms, in which the\r\nbell is rung continuously by the electric current so long as the circuit\r\nis closed. The action is very simple: a soft iron armature, A, is\r\nattached to the steel spring, B, and prolonged into a hammer, C, which\r\nstrikes the bell, D, every time the armature is attracted to the\r\nelectro-magnet. The armature and the spring, E, form part of the\r\ncircuit, which is continued by connectors to F, and through the coils to\r\nG. The spring, E, does not follow the armature in its motion towards the\r\nelectro-magnet, and consequently the circuit is broken before the\r\narmature touches the magnet; but the hammer strikes the bell, and the\r\nelasticity of the spring, B, brings the armature back into contact with\r\nE, the circuit is closed, and the motions are repeated, so that the bell\r\nis struck a rapid succession of blows. This _make-and-break_ movement is\r\nprecisely similar to that with which Ruhmkorff’s coils are usually\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 283.—_Electro-Magnetic Bells._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBelow the dial of the instrument, in Fig. 282, may be seen two handles.\r\nEach of these is connected with an arrangement constituting the\r\ntransmitting apparatus, by which the metallic contacts are varied\r\naccording to the position of the handles. When the handle is vertical,\r\nall communication with the battery in connection with the instrument is\r\ncut off, but the coils are ready to receive any current from the\r\nline-wires. When the handle is turned to the right or left, the contacts\r\nare such that the battery current flows into the line, and deflects to\r\nthe right or left the needles of both receiving and transmitting\r\ninstruments. The single-needle instrument as now made is of a very\r\nsimple and inexpensive construction, and it is the form principally used\r\nin connection with the working of lines of railway. One may see at every\r\nstation in the United Kingdom the little vertical needle, mounted in the\r\ncentre of a small perfectly plain green dial-plate; for the letters and\r\nsigns with which it was formerly the practice to cover the dial have\r\nbeen found to distract the eye more than they aid the memory. A boy will\r\nafter a few weeks’ practice learn to read the signals and to transmit\r\nmessages with considerable rapidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 284.—_Portable Single-Needle Instrument._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe field telegraph lines, which are used in actual warfare to enable\r\nthe commander of an army to communicate with every part of his forces,\r\nrequire as the essential condition for their construction rapidity of\r\nerection and removal, and the greatest possible simplicity and\r\nportability in the sending and receiving instruments. The wires are\r\nfastened to trees, or other fixed supports, where such are available,\r\nbut artificial supports are provided in light poles which admit of being\r\nreadily planted in the ground and removed. In cases where it is\r\ninexpedient or impossible to use these, the conductor may be laid along\r\nthe ground, but must then be well insulated with some non-conducting\r\nmaterial, which is capable of withstanding the action of the weather. A\r\nkind of cable is usually employed, in which is the conductor, made of\r\ncopper, protected and strengthened by hemp fibres and covered with some\r\nnon-conducting material. No form of needle telegraph instrument could be\r\nsimpler than that represented in Fig. 284, which has been designed for\r\nmilitary purposes. The communicator, or transmitting apparatus, here\r\nshows an arrangement very compact, and not easily deranged. The springs,\r\nA B, press against the piece of metal marked C, with which good contact\r\nis insured by providing the springs with several projecting steel\r\npoints. D, E are finger-keys of ebonite or ivory; underneath are two\r\npoints of a metallic conductor on which the springs can be pressed down\r\nby a touch of the finger. This conductor is in communication with the\r\nbinding-screw, F, from which a wire proceeds to the negative or zinc end\r\nof the battery, while the piece, C, is in metallic connection with G, to\r\nwhich a wire proceeding to the positive or copper end of the battery is\r\nattached. From B a wire, H, communicates through the hinge with one end\r\nof the coil, the upper end of which is connected through the upper hinge\r\nwith a binding-screw not visible in the figure, and to this the end of\r\nthe line conductor is attached. From A a wire K passes to another\r\nbinding-screw, by which the earth connection is made. A current arriving\r\nby the line traverses the coils and passes through H and B into C, hence\r\nby A into the earth through K. When D is depressed the current from the\r\nbattery passing from G through C, A, and K, into the earth, and thus to\r\nthe distant station, returns through the coils of the instrument there\r\nand along the line wire, through the coils, L L, and by H, B, D and F,\r\nto the negative pole of the battery. The reader will have little\r\ndifficulty in tracing the course of the reverse currents, whether sent\r\nor received, which deflect the needles in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe field telegraph instrument selected by the War Department of the\r\nUnited States Government is also extremely simple, communicating its\r\nsignals, not by the deflections of a needle, but by the blows on an\r\nelectro-magnet of its armature. The letters are indicated by various\r\ncombinations of two signals—one, a single stroke of the armature; and\r\nthe other, two blows in very rapid succession. The alphabet used is the\r\n“General Service Flag Code” of the American army and navy, and the\r\nsignal numerals of this code are indicated by contacts of the\r\ntransmitting key—one contact producing a single blow of the armature,\r\nimplying the numeral 1, and two rapidly succeeding contacts causing two\r\nblows, which stand for the numeral 2. The signals are read merely by the\r\nsound made by the stroke of the armature. In the table below the code is\r\ngiven, dots being used to represent the contacts of the key in the\r\n“sending” instrument, and the blows of the armature in the “receiving”\r\ninstrument—the single dots standing for one contact or sound, and the\r\ndouble dots for the double blows:\r\n\r\n               ┌────────┬──────────┬────────────────────┐\r\n               │Letters.│Flag Code.│ Telegraph Signals. │\r\n               ├────────┼──────────┼────────────────────┤\r\n               │   A    │2 2       │·· ··               │\r\n               │   B    │2 1 1 2   │·· ·  ·  ··         │\r\n               │   C    │1 2 1     │·  ·· ·             │\r\n               │   D    │2 2 2     │·· ·· ··            │\r\n               │   E    │1 2       │·  ··               │\r\n               │   F    │2 2 2 1   │·· ·· ·· ·          │\r\n               │   G    │2 2 1 1   │·· ·· ·  ·          │\r\n               │   H    │1 2 2     │·  ·· ··            │\r\n               │   I    │1         │·                   │\r\n               │   J    │1 1 2 2   │·  ·  ·· ··         │\r\n               │   K    │2 1 2 1   │·· ·  ·· ·          │\r\n               │   L    │2 2 1     │·· ·· ·             │\r\n               │   M    │1 2 2 1   │·  ·· ·· ·          │\r\n               │   N    │1 1       │·  ·                │\r\n               │   O    │2 1       │·· ·                │\r\n               │   P    │1 2 1 2   │·  ·· ·  ··         │\r\n               │   Q    │1 2 1 1   │·  ·· ·  ·          │\r\n               │   R    │2 1 1     │·· ·  ·             │\r\n               │   S    │2 1 2     │·· ·  ··            │\r\n               │   T    │2         │··                  │\r\n               │   U    │1 1 2     │·  ·  ··            │\r\n               │   V    │1 2 2 2   │·  ·· ·· ··         │\r\n               │   W    │1 1 2 1   │·  ·  ·· ·          │\r\n               │   X    │2 1 2 2   │·· ·  ·· ··         │\r\n               │   Y    │1 1 1     │·  ·  ·             │\r\n               │   Z    │2 2 2 2   │·· ·· ·· ··         │\r\n               └────────┴──────────┴────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThere are similar signals for the numerals and for a few often-recurring\r\nsyllables.\r\n\r\nThe telegraphs we have hitherto described leave no record of the\r\ndespatches sent, and hence the messages cannot be read at leisure, and\r\nerrors which may occur in the transmission cannot be traced to their\r\nsource. A system which registers the messages as actually received has\r\nplainly many advantages over those which merely give a visible or\r\naudible signal without leaving any trace. Hence many contrivances have\r\nbeen proposed for making the receiving apparatus print the message in\r\nordinary characters. Such instruments are necessarily very much more\r\ncomplicated in their construction than those we have already mentioned,\r\nand by no means so simple as the system we are about to describe,\r\nnamely, the Morse Telegraph, which is now so largely used, being\r\nuniversally adopted in America and on the continent of Europe; and,\r\nsince the telegraphic communication in Great Britain came into the hands\r\nof the Post-office authorities, here, also, the Morse is the system most\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 285.—_Connections of a Telegraphic Line, with Morse Instruments._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the transmitters, batteries, receiving\r\ninstruments, &c., should be first studied in its simplest form, as\r\nrepresented by the diagram, Fig. 285. M represents the vertical coils of\r\nan electro-magnet upon which we are supposed to be looking down; the\r\narmature, A, is attached to a lever, F, which, by the attraction of the\r\nelectro-magnet is therefore drawn down. In the position of the\r\nconnections, as represented, no current is passing, but if K be pressed\r\ndown so as to make connection at 1, at the same time it is broken at 2,\r\na current will pass in from the positive pole of battery, B, into the\r\nline by 1, 3, L, L´, and through 3´, 2´ through the coils of the\r\nelectro-magnet at M´ into the earth, and so back to the negative pole,\r\nZ. The armature, A´, will be attracted so long as the current continues.\r\nSimilarly, contact made at 1´ and broken at 2´, will affect the\r\nelectro-magnet, M, from the battery at B´. It should be noticed here\r\nthat it is not a question of the reversal of currents sent from the same\r\nbattery; the key merely enables the operator to send a current in one\r\ndirection, so as to affect the distant electro-magnet whenever or so\r\nlong as he depresses the key. We shall now examine the construction of\r\nthe Morse receiving apparatus, one of the most complete forms of which\r\nis depicted in Fig. 286. In the present description we wish the reader\r\nto consider only the portion of the apparatus towards the left, and to\r\nsuppose the absence of the electro-magnet at the right-hand side, with\r\nall the appliances immediately connected with it. He must regard the\r\nelectro-magnet, A, as corresponding with M´ in Fig. 285, and remember\r\nthat it is in the power of the distant operator at K to throw the\r\ncurrent of his battery through the coils of A, by simply depressing his\r\nkey. When the current passes the armature, B, it is attracted, and the\r\nlever, C, to which it is attached, turns on its bearings at D, and the\r\nend, E, of its longer arm is pressed upwards. At this end of the lever,\r\nin the earlier form of the instrument, was a blunt steel point which,\r\nwhile the armature was attracted to the electro-magnet, was pressed into\r\na shallow groove in a metallic roller. Between the roller and the steel\r\npoint a paper ribbon, half an inch wide, K, was unwound from the drum,\r\nL, by the two rollers, M and N, which grip the paper between them as\r\nthey are turned by clockwork within the case, F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 286.—_Morse Recording Telegraph._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn important improvement was effected when, instead of steel points for\r\nembossing the message, the Morse instrument was provided with an\r\narrangement for printing the signals in ink; since the pressure required\r\nfor embossing the paper is considerably greater than that needed merely\r\nto bring it into contact with the edge of a little inked disc. In the\r\ninking arrangement the strip of paper travels just below the margin of a\r\nvertical disc, turned by the clockwork, and having its plane parallel to\r\nthe length of the paper strip. The narrow edge of this disc is kept\r\ncharged with printer’s ink, which it receives from a roller. The end of\r\nthe lever connected with the armature of the electro-magnet is formed of\r\na light strip of metal carrying a narrow projection at the end, over\r\nwhich the paper passes, just beneath, but not touching, the inking disc.\r\nWhen the current passes, the little projection is lifted up, and raises\r\nthe paper into contact with the ink, printing either a dot or a dash\r\naccording to the duration of the current. The amount of force required\r\nto raise an inch or two of the length of the paper ribbon through a\r\nspace not greater than the twentieth of an inch is but small, and much\r\nless than would be required to emboss the paper; so that in a great many\r\ncases the part of the apparatus which is represented in Fig. 286, on the\r\nright, may be dispensed with. In other cases it is, however, necessary;\r\nas when, from the length of the line, the currents are too feeble to\r\ngive clear indications with the printing lever; and we shall, therefore,\r\npresently describe its arrangement and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe clockwork is actuated by a spring, wound by the handle G, but its\r\naction is suspended by a detent, which is released by touching the lever\r\nH. When the clockwork is in action and the current constantly\r\ncirculating in the coils, a continuous line, parallel to the length of\r\nthe ribbon, would be printed upon it, in consequence of the contact with\r\nthe inking-disc, P, being maintained; but when a momentary current only\r\nrushes through the coils, the armature attracted but for an instant,\r\ngives rise to merely a dot on the passing paper, while a current of a\r\nlittle duration will cause the paper to be marked with a short line or\r\ndash.\r\n\r\nThe dot and the dash are the elementary signs of the Morse code of\r\nsignals, and these are producible according to the time the contact key\r\nis held down at the distant station. By employing various combinations\r\nof these two signs, the letters of the alphabet, numerals, &c., are\r\nindicated. In selecting the combinations Professor Morse had regard to\r\nthe frequency with which the different letters recur in the English\r\nlanguage. Thus, for the letter E, which is more frequently used than any\r\nother, the symbol chosen was a single dot; and for T, which is the next\r\nmost frequently employed, the dash was plainly the most appropriate;\r\nthen the four only possible combinations of the signs in pairs fell to\r\nthe next most frequent letters, and so on. The following table gives the\r\ncomplete Morse code. The eye of the reader will doubtless detect a kind\r\nof symmetry in the arrangement of the signs for the first five and last\r\nfive numerals:\r\n\r\n\r\n

transmitting key. A B is a brass lever,\r\nmoving in bearings at C, and provided at the end of its longer arm with\r\na large knob or button of some insulating material. Steel pins are\r\nscrewed in at B and D, and they are so adjusted that while that at B is\r\npressed against the projection, E, by the action of the spring, F, when\r\nthe knob, K, is pressed, contact is broken at B, and established at D. D\r\nand E are each provided with a binding-screw, so that wires may be\r\nattached in the manner indicated in Fig. 285. When the key is in the\r\nposition shown, a current arriving by the line-wire passes from the\r\nfulcrum, C, of the lever through the contacts into the apparatus. When\r\nthe knob is pressed down the battery current enters the lever by the\r\ncontact at D, and passes into the line from the fulcrum, C. The clerks\r\nwho are called upon to transmit messages usually soon learn to time the\r\ncontacts very accurately in accordance with the code of signals, so as\r\nto produce the dashes and lines with accuracy. However, with certain\r\npersons some difficulty was found in acquiring the requisite uniformity,\r\nand to obviate any objection on this score, Morse invented an\r\narrangement for facilitating the signalling, which is represented in\r\nFig. 288. This is a smooth tablet of a non-conducting substance, such as\r\nivory, except the shaded portions, which are plates of metal having\r\ntheir surfaces even with that of the ivory, and all soldered to a plate\r\nof metal beneath the ivory, which places them all in communication with\r\neach other and with the binding-screw, C. The lengths of the strips of\r\nmetal and those of the spaces between them correspond with the dots and\r\ndashes of the Morse alphabet as marked on the tablet. The battery wire\r\nis connected with the binding-screw, C, and the line-wire terminates in\r\nan elastic and flexible coil of insulated wire, which is attached to a\r\nshort rod having an insulated handle and terminated by a blunt platinum\r\npoint. This the transmitter takes in his hand and draws uniformly along\r\nthe line of metal strips belonging to the letter which he wishes to\r\ntelegraph. The circuit is closed while the point of the style is passing\r\nacross the metallic strips. This arrangement appears to be but little\r\nused, but it is nevertheless admirable for its simplicity, and is\r\ndescribed here as a good illustration of the mode in which the varied\r\nduration of the contacts is able to produce the signals of the Morse\r\nalphabet. With the ordinary transmitting key a clerk is able to\r\ntelegraph, on the average, twenty or twenty-five words in a minute, but\r\nthe receiving apparatus is capable of recording three times as many.\r\nMorse also invented a system of transmitting the messages automatically,\r\nby setting up the message in a kind of type, just as ordinary letters\r\nare arranged for printing. The type, if it may be so called, had simple\r\nprojections like the slips of metal, corresponding with each letter in\r\nFig. 288. The lines of the message were drawn under a contact-lever,\r\nwhich closed the circuit when lifted up by the projections. Thus the\r\nspeed of transmission could be very greatly increased, and a single wire\r\nand apparatus had its capacity of conveying a great number of messages\r\nin a given time proportionately enlarged.\r\n\r\nWe have now to ask the reader’s attention to the details of the\r\napparatus in Fig. 286, the use of which has not already been pointed\r\nout. The electro-magnet, O O´, and the parts immediately connected with\r\nit, form what is called a _relay_. The object of this may be illustrated\r\nby supposing that the instrument is at one end of a long line, such as\r\nthat between Edinburgh and London. Let us suppose it is at Edinburgh:\r\nthe currents sent from London by a battery of convenient size might not\r\nbe powerful enough to magnetize the soft iron of A with sufficient\r\nintensity to give clearness to the signals. They are, therefore, made to\r\ncirculate in the electro-magnet, O, where they act by attracting the\r\narmature, W, which has the form of a split tube of soft iron, attached\r\nto a very light lever, Q, adjusted with great delicacy, and so that it\r\nmoves by little magnetic force. The end of the lever works between two\r\nadjustable screws, R and S, which are electrically insulated, except\r\nthat R is in communication with one extremity of the coils of the\r\nelectro-magnet, A. Q is in metallic communication through the pillar, T,\r\nand the binding-screw, U, with the zinc end of a battery at Edinburgh,\r\nwhich is called the local battery, the other pole of which communicates\r\nwith the other ends of the coils, A, through the screw, U´. When no\r\ncurrent from London is passing through O, Q is held down by the spring,\r\nW´, and the circuit of the local battery is broken; but the instant the\r\nline-current passes, the armature, W, is attracted, and Q makes contact\r\nwith R, the current from the local battery rushes through the coils, A,\r\nand the appropriate movements of the printing lever are effected by its\r\naction. X is a spring for drawing down the lever, and it is provided\r\nwith a screw for adjusting its tension, and Y, Z, are screws for\r\nlimiting the extent of motion of the lever; under P is the little\r\nprojection by which the band of paper is pressed against the\r\ninking-disc; _l_ and _e_ are respectively the screws for the line and\r\nearth connections.\r\n\r\nAn extremely ingenious system of signalling, by which the speed could be\r\ngreatly increased, has been devised by Sir Charles Wheatstone, and is\r\nlargely adopted by the British postal authorities. In this system the\r\nmessage is first translated into telegraphic language by a machine,\r\nwhich punches certain holes in a strip of stiff paper. The apparatus\r\noriginally designed for this purpose by the inventor is thus described\r\nby him in the Juror’s Report, International Exhibition of 1862:\r\n\r\n“Long strips of paper are perforated by a machine constructed for the\r\npurpose, with apertures grouped to represent the letters of the alphabet\r\nand other signs. A strip thus prepared is placed in an instrument\r\nassociated with a source of electric power, which, on being set in\r\nmotion, moves it along, and causes it to act on two pins in such a\r\nmanner that when one of them is elevated the current is transmitted to\r\nthe telegraphic circuit in one direction, when the other is elevated it\r\nis transmitted in the reverse direction. The elevations and depressions\r\nof these pins are governed by the apertures and intervening intervals.\r\nThese currents, following each other indifferently in these two opposite\r\ndirections, act upon a writing instrument at a distant station in such a\r\nmanner as to produce corresponding marks on a slip of paper, moved by\r\nappropriate mechanism.\r\n\r\n“The first apparatus is a _perforator_, an instrument for piercing the\r\nslips of paper with the apertures in the order required to form the\r\nmessage. The slip of paper passes through a guiding groove, at the\r\nbottom of which an opening is made sufficiently large to admit of the\r\nto-and-fro motion of the upper end of a frame containing three punches,\r\nthe extremities of which are in the same transverse line. Each of these\r\npunches, the middle one of which is smaller than the two external ones,\r\nmay be separately elevated by the pressure of a finger-key.\r\n\r\n“By the pressure of either finger-key, simultaneously with the elevation\r\nof its corresponding punch, in order to perforate the paper, two\r\ndifferent movements are successively produced: first, the raising of a\r\nclip which holds the paper firmly in its position; and secondly, the\r\nadvancing motion of the frame containing the three punches, by which the\r\npunch which is raised carries the slip of paper forward the proper\r\ndistance. During the reaction of the key consequent on the removal of\r\nthe pressure, the clip first fastens the paper, and then the frame falls\r\nback to its normal position. The two external keys and punches are\r\nemployed to make the holes, which, grouped together, represent letters\r\nand other characters, and the middle punch to make holes which mark the\r\nintervals between the letters.\r\n\r\n“The second apparatus is the _transmitter_, the object of which is to\r\nreceive the slips of paper prepared by the perforator, and to transmit\r\nthe currents in the order and direction corresponding to the holes\r\nperforated in the slip. This it effects by mechanism somewhat similar to\r\nthat by which the perforator performs its functions. An eccentric\r\nproduces and regulates the occurrence of three distinct movements: 1.\r\nThe to-and-fro motion of a small frame which contains a groove fitted to\r\nreceive the slip of paper, and to carry it forward by its advancing\r\nmotion. 2. The elevation and depression of a spring-clip, which holds\r\nthe slip of paper firmly during the receding motion, but allows it to\r\nmove freely during the advancing motion. 3. The simultaneous elevation\r\nof three wires placed parallel to each other, resting at one of their\r\nends over the axis of the eccentric, and their free ends entering\r\ncorresponding holes in the grooved frame. These three wires are not\r\nfixed to the axis of the eccentric, but each end of them rests against\r\nit by the upward pressure of a spring; so that when a light pressure is\r\nexerted on the free end of either of them, it is capable of being\r\nseparately depressed. When the slip of paper is not inserted the\r\neccentric is in action; a pin attached to each of the external wires\r\ntouches during the advancing and receding motions of the frame a\r\ndifferent spring; and an arrangement is adopted, by means of insulation\r\nand contacts properly applied, by which, while one of the wires is\r\nelevated, the other remains depressed; the current passes to the\r\ntelegraphic circuit in one direction, and passes in the other direction\r\nwhen the wire before elevated is depressed, and _vice versâ_; but while\r\nboth wires are simultaneously elevated or depressed the passing of the\r\ncurrent is interrupted. When the prepared slip of paper is inserted in\r\nthe groove, and moved forward whenever the end of one of the wires\r\nenters an aperture in its corresponding row, the current passes in one\r\ndirection, and when the end of the other wire enters an aperture of the\r\nother row, it passes in the other direction. By this means the currents\r\nare made to succeed each other _automatically_ in their proper order and\r\ndirection to give the requisite variety of signals. The middle wire only\r\nacts as a guide during the operation of the current.\r\n\r\n“The wheel which drives the eccentric may be moved by the hand, or by\r\nthe application of any motive power. Where the movement of the\r\ntransmitter is effected by machinery, any number may be attended to by\r\none or two assistants. This transmitter requires only a single\r\ntelegraphic wire.\r\n\r\n“The third apparatus is the _recording_ or _printing apparatus_, which\r\nprints or impresses legible marks on a strip of paper, corresponding in\r\ntheir arrangement with the apertures in the perforated paper. The pens\r\nor styles are elevated or depressed by their connection with the moving\r\nparts of the electro-magnets. The pens are entirely independent of each\r\nother in their action, and are so arranged that when the current passes\r\nthrough the coils of the electro-magnet in one direction, one of the\r\npens is depressed, and when it passes in the contrary direction the\r\nother is depressed; when the currents cease, light springs restore the\r\npens to their elevated points. The mode of supplying the pens with ink\r\nis the following: A reservoir about an eighth of an inch deep, and of\r\nany convenient length and breath, is made in a piece of metal, the\r\ninterior of which may be gilt in order to avoid the corrosive action of\r\nthe ink; at the bottom of this reservoir are two holes, sufficiently\r\nsmall to prevent by capillary attraction the ink from flowing through\r\nthem; the ends of the pens are placed immediately above these small\r\napertures, which they enter when the electro-magnets act upon them,\r\ncarrying with them a sufficient charge of ink to make a legible mark on\r\na ribbon of paper passing beneath them. The motion of the paper ribbon\r\nis produced and regulated by apparatus similar to those employed in\r\nother register and printing telegraphs.”\r\n\r\nThe mode by which Wheatstone proposed to indicate the letters was novel,\r\nconsisting in dots only, the numbers and positions of which in two lines\r\nalong the paper ribbon distinguished the letters—the system of combining\r\nthe symbols being still identical with the Morse code, only the dash was\r\nreplaced by a dot in the lower lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WHEATSTONE’S DOT SIGNALS.\r\n\r\n   ˙⠄    ⠄˙˙˙   ⠄˙⠄˙   ⠄˙˙     ˙     ˙˙⠄˙   ⠄⠄˙    ˙˙˙˙    ˙˙    ˙⠄⠄⠄\r\n   A      B      C      D      E      F      G      H      I      J\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MORSE’S DOT AND DASH.\r\n\r\n   ·-    -···   -·-·   -··     ·     ··-·    -·    ····    ··     ·-\r\n   A      B      C      D      E      F      G      H      I      J\r\n\r\nA single dot in the upper line stood for E, in the lower line for T; a\r\ndot in the upper line, followed by one in the lower line a little to the\r\nright, represented A; one in the lower line, followed by another in the\r\nupper line, indicated N; and so on. By the dot printing it is said that\r\nWheatstone would signal 700 letters per minute. There were, however,\r\nobjections to the new code of signals: all the world had agreed to use\r\nthe Morse alphabet, and it was perhaps less liable to incorrect reading;\r\nand for other reasons this more rapid signalling was unsuitable for\r\nsubmarine lines. The apparatus has therefore been modified to suit the\r\ndot and dash system of signals, and great improvements have been\r\neffected by Sir Charles on the original instruments, with a view of\r\nincreasing the rapidity of transmission as much as possible. The paper\r\nas punched for the Morse signals shows a row of equidistant holes in the\r\nmiddle, by which the paper is guided uniformly forward, and in the outer\r\nrows are holes arranged in pairs, either exactly opposite to each other\r\nor obliquely—the former produce dots at the receiving station, the\r\nlatter dashes. From 60 to 100 words can thus be sent and printed in one\r\nminute, and the automatic transmitting system can be applied to the\r\nneedle, or any other form of telegraph.\r\n\r\nAfter a clerk has for some time been habituated to working with the\r\nMorse instrument, he is able to read the message from the different\r\nsounds made by the armature, as dashes or dots are respectively marked,\r\nand he usually _listens_ to the message, and transcribes it at once into\r\nordinary language by the ear alone. This observation soon led to the\r\nadoption of sound alone as the means of signalling, and an instrument on\r\nthis plan has already been referred to.\r\n\r\nAmong the more remarkable forms of recording telegraphs, that of Hughes\r\nmay be mentioned, in which the message is printed at the receiving\r\nstation in distinct Roman characters; and as only a single instantaneous\r\ncurrent is required to be sent for each letter, the speed with which a\r\nmessage can be dispatched is about three times as great as with the\r\nMorse instrument. These advantages are, however, obtained only at the\r\ncost of great delicacy and complexity in the apparatus, so that it is\r\nunfit for ordinary use, although it is much employed on important lines,\r\nwhere competent operators and skilled mechanics and electricians are at\r\nhand to keep it duly regulated. This machine is too complicated for a\r\nfull description in these pages, although it is the best form of\r\ntype-printing telegraph, and possesses a special feature in the fact\r\nthat the printing is done whilst the wheel carrying the types is in\r\nrapid rotation. The reader will find full and untechnical descriptions\r\nof this and of all the more important forms of telegraphic apparatus in\r\nMr. R. Sabine’s useful “History and Progress of the Electric Telegraph,”\r\nor in Lardner’s work as edited by Sir Charles Bright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 289.—_The Step-by-step Movement._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 290.—_Froment’s Dials._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the numerous forms of dial telegraphs we select two for\r\ndescription. All these instruments are characterized by what is called\r\nthe “step-by-step” movement, and differ in their mechanical details, and\r\nin the nature of the apparatus for producing the currents, some being\r\ndriven by electro-magnets and others by galvanic batteries. Their\r\nprinciple may be easily explained. Suppose that a ratchet-wheel, having\r\ntwenty-six teeth, is mounted on an axis carrying a hand over a dial\r\nhaving the letters of the alphabet inscribed upon it. A simple\r\narrangement in connection with an electro-magnet, somewhat like the\r\nescapement of a clock, will serve to advance the wheel by one tooth each\r\ntime a current passes. The diagram, Fig. 289, will at once make this\r\nprinciple clear. E is the electro-magnet, F the armature, separated by\r\nthe spring, S, from the magnet, except when the current passes, when the\r\ncatch, C, draws down the tooth in which it is engaged, so that a tooth\r\npasses under the point at D; and when the current ceases, the spring, S,\r\nbrings up the catch to engage the succeeding tooth, and thus the hand\r\nmoves step by step in the direction of the arrow, advancing each time\r\nthe electric circuit is closed by one twenty-sixth of a revolution. In\r\nFig. 290 is represented lecture-table models of a step-by-step\r\nindicating and transmitting instrument, as constructed by M. Froment, of\r\nParis. These instruments are supposed to be at the extremities of a long\r\nline of wire. The left-hand figure is the manipulator, or sending\r\ninstrument, in which the operator has merely to quickly turn round the\r\nindex in the direction of the hands of a watch, by means of the knob, P,\r\nuntil it points to the desired letter, pause at the letter for an\r\ninstant, and then quickly continue the movement until his index points\r\nto the cross at the top of the dial, where he pauses if the word is\r\nspelt out, and, if not, continues the rotation until he arrives at the\r\nnext letter, and so on. All these movements and pauses the hand on the\r\nindicator will accurately repeat, and the reason of this may be seen by\r\nobserving that the battery contacts are made by the projections on the\r\nmetallic wheel, R, which turn with the index. The spring, N, is always\r\nin contact with the wheel, but the spring, M, has such a shape that\r\ncontact is alternately made and broken as the projections and spaces\r\npass it. It is obvious that the needle of the indicator will therefore\r\nadvance over the same letters as the index of the communicator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 291.—_Wheatstone’s Universal Dial Telegraph._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA very elegant dial instrument has been invented by Sir Charles\r\nWheatstone, in which magneto-electric currents are made use of. In Fig.\r\n291 communicator and indicator are represented mounted in one case, or\r\nsmall box. The larger dial is the communicator, and its circumference is\r\ndivided into thirty equal spaces, in which are the twenty-six letters of\r\nthe alphabet, three punctuation marks, and a +. In an inner circle are\r\ntwo series of numerals and other signs. About the circumference of the\r\ndial are thirty small buttons or projecting keys, conveniently arranged,\r\nso as to be readily depressed by the touch of a finger. Inside of the\r\nbox a strong permanent horse-shoe magnet is fixed, and near its poles a\r\npair of armatures of soft iron cores with insulated wire coils revolve\r\nwhen the handle, A, is turned, as in the machines described in the last\r\narticle. In this manner a series of waves or short currents of\r\nelectricity are produced in the conductors when the circuit is complete,\r\nand the currents are alternately in opposite directions, so that fifteen\r\nrevolutions of the coils will produce fifteen currents in one direction\r\nand fifteen in the other. A pinion on the same spindle as the coils\r\nworks with a wheel on the axis carrying the pointer on the dial, so that\r\nthe pointer makes a complete revolution as often as the handle, A, makes\r\nfifteen turns. Each of the thirty currents will pass through the\r\nindicator, I, and through the line to the distant station, where they\r\nwill, by a step-by-step movement, advance the needle of the indicator.\r\nSo that the hand of the dial and the needle of the indicator at the\r\nsending station, and that of the indicator at the distant station, will\r\nall simultaneously be pointing to the same letter on their respective\r\ndials; and they would continue to move round these, ever pointing to the\r\nsame letter, so long as the handle, A, is turned. How, then, is the\r\nsender to cause the needle of his correspondent’s instrument to pause at\r\nany desired letter? Not by stopping the revolution of the handle, A, for\r\nthat could not be done so as to send just the right number of currents,\r\ninasmuch as the rotating armatures could not be instantly stopped. The\r\nmode of causing the indicators to pause at any required letter is as\r\nsimple as it is ingenious. It has been already mentioned that the\r\nstep-by-step movement takes place at every current which passes through\r\nthe line, including the two indicators, and that thirty such currents\r\npass at each revolution of the pointer of the communicator. But when\r\nthese currents no longer flow, the indicators, of course, stop; and the\r\nstoppage of the movements is reconciled with the continuous production\r\nof the currents by having a series of little levers, each connected with\r\none of the buttons, and so arranged that when one of these has been\r\npushed down, the lever stops the revolution when it has come round of an\r\narm on the same central axis as the pointer, and riding loosely on a\r\nhollow spindle, which bears the toothed wheel, driven by the pinion\r\nalready spoken of. The projecting arm is provided with a spring, which\r\nfalls between the teeth of the wheel, so that the arm is with certainty\r\ncarried round with the wheel. But where a button has been pushed down,\r\nits lever catches the arm, lifting its spring away from the teeth of the\r\nwheel. So long as the key remains down, the arrested arm makes a short\r\nmetallic circuit by its contact, and no currents pass into the line, for\r\nthey take the shortest path. The key is raised only when another is\r\ndepressed, and then the arm and the pointer immediately resume their\r\nrevolution until they again become stationary at the letter\r\ncorresponding with the key which has been pushed down. Suppose the key\r\nof +, the zero of the dial, to be down, which is the proper condition of\r\nthe apparatus when a message has to be dispatched. The operator having\r\nrung a bell at the distant end, to call the attention of the person who\r\nreceives his message, begins to turn the handle, A, at the rate of about\r\ntwo revolutions per second. In this state of affairs no current is\r\npassing into the line, and the fingers of both his communicator and\r\nindicator remain stationary, as does also that of the indicator at the\r\ndistant end of the line. Now, suppose he has to spell the word “FOX.” He\r\nturns the handle A continuously with his right hand the whole time he is\r\nsending the message; and, manipulating the keys with his left, he\r\ndepresses that opposite to the letter F. By this action the key opposite\r\n+ is raised, for the levers are pressed into notches against a\r\nwatch-chain, which has just enough _slack_ to allow one lever to enter a\r\nnotch, and therefore the pressure of another lever always raises the key\r\nlast depressed. When the operator presses down the F key, the + rises,\r\nthe radial arm is instantly released, and with the index is carried on\r\nto F, where it stops; and the contacts will have, during that movement,\r\nsent six currents into the line, so that the fingers of both indicators\r\nwill also point to F. When the pointer of the communicator has made just\r\na visible pause at F, he pushes down the key of O, and all the three\r\npointers recommence their journeys towards that letter. The operator\r\nmust, of course, wait until they have reached it and paused an instant,\r\nwhen he depresses the button opposite X; and when the index has pointed\r\nat that, he pushes down the + key, whereby the fingers all arrest their\r\nmovements at that point, indicating that the word is completed. In the\r\ncase supposed the word is completed by a single revolution of the\r\npointers; but this is, of course, not usually the case; thus, in\r\nindicating the syllable “PON,” nearly three complete revolutions would\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\nThis admirable little instrument was designed for the use of private\r\npersons, and is largely used in London and elsewhere. Its great\r\ncompactness and simplicity of operation render it highly suitable for\r\nthis purpose. There is no battery required, and all the inconvenient\r\nattention demanded by a battery is therefore dispensed with. On the\r\nother hand, the magnets gradually lose their power, and after a time\r\nmust be re-magnetized; and the electro-motive force developed in these\r\ninstruments is insufficient for lengths of line much exceeding 100\r\nmiles. For shorter lines, and for the purposes for which they are\r\ndesigned, these instruments are perfection.\r\n\r\nVery interesting forms of telegraph are those in which a despatch is not\r\nmerely written or printed, but actually transcribed as a _facsimile_ of\r\nthe writing in the original; and in this way it is possible for a design\r\nto be drawn telegraphically at the distance of hundreds of miles. Like\r\nthe Hughes’ printing telegraph, the instruments which produce these\r\napparently marvellous results require synchronous movements at the two\r\nstations. But although they are scientifically successful, there appears\r\nto be no public demand for these copying telegraphs. One of the best\r\nknown is Bonelli’s, which dispatches its messages automatically when\r\nthey have been set up in raised metal types precisely similar to the\r\nRoman capitals in the type of the ordinary printer. In Bonelli’s and\r\nmost other copying telegraphs the impressions are produced by chemical\r\ndecompositions—effected at the receiving station on the paper prepared\r\nto receive the message. By Bonelli’s instrument it is said that when the\r\ntype has been set up, messages can be sent at the extraordinary rate of\r\n1,200 words in one minute of time! The action of this system is such\r\nthat it is proved to be possible to reproduce in a few seconds—at York,\r\nsay—the very characters of a page of type the moment before set up in\r\nLondon. The limits of our space will not admit of details of this\r\ninvention; but we here place before the reader a _facsimile_ of the\r\nletters printed by it at the receiving stations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BONELLI’S CHEMICAL TELEGRAPH]\r\n\r\nWe have to describe two other forms of instruments for receiving\r\ntelegraphic signals, both contrived with consummate skill by Sir William\r\nThomson, and, though exhibiting no new principle in any of their parts,\r\nboth fine examples of beautiful adjustment of materials for a desired\r\nend. In these forms of apparatus, the delicacy of the mechanical\r\nconstruction, and the accurate relations of one part to another, have\r\nproduced results of the greatest practical importance. Fig. 292\r\nrepresents the _mirror galvanometer_, an instrument which has not only\r\nproved of the highest value in scientific researches, but is of the\r\nfirst importance in submarine telegraphy. It is in principle nothing\r\nmore than the single-needle telegraph, and it is exceedingly simple in\r\nconstruction. A very small and light magnet, such as might be formed by\r\na fragment of the mainspring of a watch, ⅜ths of an inch long, say, is\r\nattached to the back of a little circular mirror, made of extremely thin\r\nsilvered glass, also about ⅜ths of an inch in diameter. The mirror and\r\nmagnet are suspended by a single cocoon-fibre, so fine as to be almost\r\ninvisible, in the centre of a coil, A, of fine silk-covered copper wire.\r\nIn front of the suspended mirror, in the axis of the coil, is placed a\r\nlens of about four feet focal distance, and opposite to this is a screen\r\nhaving a slit, B, in the centre, behind which is placed a paraffin lamp,\r\nD. The screen is provided with a paper scale, C, divided into equal\r\nparts, and is placed at the distance of about two feet from the little\r\nmirror. It follows, from this arrangement, that when the light passing\r\nthrough the slit falls upon the mirror, it is reflected again through\r\nthe lens, and an image of the slit is seen on the scale. This image is\r\nimmediately above the slit when the beam falls perpendicularly upon the\r\nmirror, and this condition may be brought about by properly placing the\r\napparatus with regard to the magnetic meridian. The directive power of\r\nthe earth over the little suspended magnet is, however, _almost_\r\nannulled by properly fixing the steel magnet, E, which slides upon the\r\nupright rod, so that the suspended magnet is thus free to obey the least\r\nforce impressed upon it by a current passing through the coil. And when\r\nthe mirror is deflected through a certain angle, the image on the scale\r\nwill be deflected to twice that angle, and thus the smallest movements\r\nof the suspended magnet are readily recognized; not only by reason of\r\nthe length of the beam of light, which forms a weightless index, but\r\nbecause they are doubled by this increased angular deflection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 292.—_The Mirror Galvanometer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the signals are being rapidly transmitted through a long submarine\r\nline, the currents at the receiving station are much enfeebled and\r\nretarded, and the result is that the movements of a suspended needle\r\nhave by no means the decided character which is seen in the instruments\r\nconnected with land lines. The signals through a submarine cable could\r\nnot therefore be received by any apparatus which required a certain\r\nstrength of current; but the mirror galvanometer indicates every change\r\nin the currents, and the apparently irregular motions of the spot of\r\nlight can be interpreted by a skilled clerk, who, by long experience,\r\nrecognizes, in quite dissimilar effects, the same signal sent by the\r\nclerk at the other end in precisely the same way. Thus a first contact,\r\ncorresponding with a dot of the Morse alphabet, may cause the light to\r\nmove some distance on the scale, a second contact immediately succeeding\r\nmoves it but a little way farther, and a third may occasion a movement\r\nhardly perceptible.\r\n\r\nThe messages sent by the mirror galvanometer must be read as they are\r\nreceived; and, as a telegraphic instrument, it is wanting in the\r\nmanifest advantages attending a recording instrument. Sir W. Thomson\r\nhas, however, devised another receiving instrument of great delicacy,\r\nwhich is termed the _syphon recorder_. We cannot here describe its\r\nadmirable mechanical and electrical details, but the chief feature is\r\nthat the attractions and repulsions of the currents are made to produce\r\noscillations in a syphon formed of an extremely fine glass tube, the\r\nshorter branch of which dips in a trough of ink, and the longer branch\r\nterminates opposite to, but not touching, a band of paper, which is\r\ncontinuously and regularly drawn along by clockwork while the message is\r\nbeing received. The tube is a mere hair-like hollow filament of glass,\r\nand the ink, which would not itself flow from a tube of so fine a bore,\r\nis squirted out by electrical repulsion when the insulated reservoir in\r\nwhich it is contained is electrified at the receiving station by an\r\nordinary machine. The message as written by this instrument appears\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _the syphon recorder_]\r\n\r\nThe reader, on comparing these signals with the Morse code on page 560,\r\nwill have no difficulty in discovering their relation to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _TELEGRAPHIC LINES._\r\n\r\nIt now remains to give some account of the _line_, that is, the\r\nconductor by which the sending and receiving instruments are united, and\r\nalong which the currents flow. Overhead lines are nearly always\r\nconstructed with iron wires, which are usually ⅙ in. in diameter, and\r\nare coated with some substance to protect them from oxidation. Zinc is\r\noften used for this purpose, the wire being drawn through melted zinc,\r\nby which it becomes covered with a film of this metal—a process known as\r\n“galvanizing” iron. Another mode is to cover the wires with tar, or to\r\nvarnish them from time to time with boiled linseed oil, and this _must_\r\nbe done in populous places, where the gases in the air are liable to act\r\nupon the zinc. Sometimes _underground_ wires are used, and these are\r\noften made of copper, covered with gutta-percha, and are laid in wooden\r\ntroughs, or in iron pipes. They are protected by having tape or other\r\nmaterial, saturated with tar or bitumen, wound round them. The poles\r\nemployed to suspend the overhead wires are generally made of larch or\r\nfir, of such a length that when securely fixed in the ground they rise\r\n12 ft. to 25 ft. above it, and at the top have a diameter of about 5 in.\r\nAbout thirty poles are required for each mile, and every tenth pole\r\nforms a “stretching-post,” being made stronger than the others and\r\nprovided with some appliance by which the wires can be tightened when\r\nrequired. The wires are attached to the posts by insulating supports;\r\nbut at every pole there is always some “leakage,” the amount of which\r\ndepends on the form, material, and condition of the insulators. Glass is\r\nquite unsuitable, because its surface strongly attracts moisture, which\r\nthus forms a conducting film. All things considered, porcelain is found\r\nto be the best insulating material for this purpose, since moisture is\r\nnot readily deposited on its surface, and even rain runs off without\r\nwetting it; and it is durable, strong, and clean. Fig. 293 shows a\r\ntelegraph post, with brown salt-glazed stoneware insulators, shaped like\r\nhour-glasses, with a perspective view and section of one of them.\r\nAnother form of insulator, shown in Fig. 294, has a stalk or hook of\r\nporcelain, with a notch, into which the wire is simply lifted, and is\r\nprotected above by a porcelain bell. This form, or some modification of\r\nit, is that most generally used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 293.—_Telegraph Post and Insulators._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 294.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be remarked that only a single wire is required with most\r\nof the modern instruments for communication between any two places. Each\r\nof the many wires often seen attached to the telegraph posts along a\r\nroad or railway represents a distinct line of communication—that is, one\r\nwire may connect the two termini, another may join an intermediate\r\nstation and a terminus, a third may belong to two intermediate stations,\r\nand so on. We have already alluded to the discovery by Steinheil of the\r\napparent conducting power of the earth; and if we must continue to think\r\nof complete circuits, we must regard the earth as replacing for\r\ntelegraphic purposes the second or return wire, which was at first\r\nsupposed essential. For instance, when a battery current had to be sent\r\nfrom Station A, Fig. 295, which we may suppose to be London, to Station\r\nB, which we may call Slough, it was at first thought requisite to\r\nprovide a wire for the return of the current after it had traversed the\r\ncoils at the receiving station. But now the connections are made as\r\nshown in Fig. 296, where the return wire is dispensed with, except a\r\nsmall portion at each end, which is connected with a large plate of\r\ncopper buried in the earth; the arrows show the direction of the\r\ncurrent, according to the commonly received notion. By this plan the\r\ncurrent is increased in intensity, for the “earth circuit” appears to\r\noffer less resistance than the copper wire. The view, however, which\r\nregards the earth not as a conductor in the same sense as the wire, but\r\nas the great _reservoir or storehouse of electricity_, accords better\r\nwith known facts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 295.—_Wire Circuit._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 296.—_Wire and Earth Circuit._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe spread of telegraph lines, and the extent to which this mode of\r\ncommunication is used by the public, may be illustrated by a few\r\nparticulars regarding the Central Telegraphic Office in London. The\r\nmanagement of all the public telegraph lines in Great Britain is now in\r\nthe hands of the Post Office authorities, and the arrangements at the\r\ncentral office in London are an admirable specimen of administrative\r\norganization. The Central Telegraph Office occupies a very large and\r\nhandsome building opposite the General Post Office, St.\r\nMartin’s-le-Grand. In one vast apartment in this building, containing\r\nranges of tables, in all three-quarters of a mile long, may be seen\r\nupwards of six hundred telegraph instruments, besides a number of\r\nstations for the receipt and transmission of bundles of messages by\r\npneumatic dispatch. The number of clerks employed in working the\r\ninstruments is 1,200, and about three-fourths of these are females. The\r\nwires from each instrument are conducted below the floor of the\r\napartment to a board where they terminate in binding-screws, marked with\r\nthe number of the instrument. The same board has binding-screws, with\r\nbattery connections, and others which form the terminals of the\r\ntelegraph lines, and thus the requisite connections are readily made.\r\nThe batteries are placed in a lower room, which contains about 23,000\r\ncells of Daniell’s construction, formed into nearly 1,000 distinct\r\nbatteries, in each of which the number of cells varies according to the\r\nlength of the line through which the current has to pass. Thus, the\r\nbattery which supplies the currents that are sent through the coils of\r\nthe instrument at Edinburgh consists of 60 cells, but one-sixth of that\r\nnumber suffices for some of the short lines. The instrument almost\r\nexclusively used is the Morse recorder, and Wheatstone’s automatic\r\npunching machine and transmitters are in constant employment. There are\r\nalso some examples of other instruments to be seen in operation, such as\r\nthe Hughes type printing telegraph, the American sounder, a few A, B, C,\r\ndial instruments, and a solitary specimen of a double-needle instrument.\r\nUpwards of 30,000 messages pass through this office each day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 297.—_Submarine Cable between Dover and Calais._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the most striking achievements in connection with telegraphy are the\r\ngreat submarine lines which unite the Old and New Worlds. Morse and\r\nWheatstone about the same time (1843) independently experimented with\r\nsub-aqueous insulated wires, and their success gave rise to numerous\r\nprojects for submarine lines. How far any of these might have been\r\npractical need not here be discussed, but it fortunately happened that\r\nsome years after this, the electrical properties of gutta-percha were\r\nrecognized, and this material, so admirably adapted for forming the\r\ninsulating covering of wires, was taken advantage of by Brett and Co.,\r\nwho obtained the right of establishing an electric telegraph between\r\nFrance and England, and they succeeded in laying down the first\r\nsubmarine cable. This cable extended from Dover to Cape Grisnez near\r\nCalais, and the experiment proved successful; but, unfortunately, the\r\ncable was severed within a week by the sharp rocks on which it rested\r\nnear the French coast. It proved, however, the excellent insulating\r\nproperty of the new material, and demonstrated the possibility of\r\nsubmarine telegraphic communication. Another cable was manufactured, in\r\nwhich the gutta-percha core was protected by a covering of iron wires\r\nlaid specially on the exterior, and thus combining greater security with\r\na far larger amount of tenacity. A view and section of this—the first\r\npractically successful submarine cable—are given in Fig. 297 of the real\r\nsize. It has four separate copper wires, each insulated with a covering\r\nof gutta-percha, and the whole was spun with tarred hemp into the form\r\nof a rope, and protected with an outer covering of ten of the thickest\r\niron wires wound spirally upon it. The cable when complete was 27 miles\r\nin length, and each mile weighed 7 tons. This cable was laid in 1851,\r\nand from that time it has been in constant use, with the exception of a\r\nfew interruptions from accidental ruptures. Its success immediately led\r\nto the construction of other cables connecting England with Ireland,\r\nBelgium, Holland, &c. In 1855 the practicability of an Atlantic cable\r\nwas no longer doubted, and £350,000 were soon subscribed by the public\r\nfor the project. A cable was manufactured weighing 10 tons to the mile,\r\nand in August, 1857, 338 miles of it had been successfully paid out by\r\nthe ships when the cable parted. Better paying-out apparatus was now\r\ndevised—self-releasing brakes were constructed, so that the cable should\r\nnot be exposed to too great a strain; and in 1858 another cable,\r\nrequiring a strain of 3 tons to break it, was manufactured, and the\r\nlaying of it commenced in mid-ocean—the _Mægera_ and _Agamemnon_ going\r\nin opposite directions, and paying out as they proceeded. Twice the\r\ncable was severed, twice the ships met and repaired the injury; but the\r\nthird time, when they were 200 miles apart, the cable again broke. But\r\nagain the attempt was repeated, and this time success crowned the\r\neffort; for on the 5th of August the two continents were telegraphically\r\nconnected. Unfortunately the electric continuity failed after the cable\r\nhad been a month in use.\r\n\r\nSeven years elapsed before another endeavour was made; but the\r\nexperience gained in the unsuccessful attempt was not lost; and in 1865\r\nanother cable had been constructed, and the _Great Eastern_ was employed\r\nin laying it. In this the conductor was composed of seven copper wires\r\ntwisted into one strand, covered with several layers of insulating\r\nmaterial, and covered externally with eleven stout iron wires, each of\r\nwhich was itself protected by a covering of hemp and tar. This cable was\r\n2,600 miles long, and contained 25,000 miles of copper wire, 35,000\r\nmiles of iron wire, and 400,000 miles of hempen strands, or more than\r\nsufficient to go twenty-four times round the world. It was carefully\r\nmade, mile by mile, formed into lengths of 800 miles, and shipped on\r\nboard the _Great Eastern_ in enormous iron tanks, which weighed, with\r\ntheir contents, more than 5,800 tons. This cable was manufactured by\r\nMessrs. Glass and Elliot, at Greenwich, to whom the iron wire for the\r\nouter covering was furnished by Messrs. Webster and Horsfall, of\r\nBirmingham. Fig. 298 represents the workshops with the iron wire in\r\nprocess of making. The great ship sailed from Valentia on the 23rd of\r\nJuly, 1865, and the paying out commenced. Constant communication was\r\nkept up with the shore, and signals exchanged with the instrument-room\r\nat Valentia, which is represented in Fig. 299, where, among various\r\ninstruments invented by Sir W. Thompson, may be seen his mirror\r\ngalvanometer. After several mishaps, which required the cable to be\r\nraised for repairs after it had been laid in deep water, the _Great\r\nEastern_ had paid out about 1,186 miles of cable, and was 1,062 miles\r\nfrom Valentia, when a loss of insulation in the cable was discovered by\r\nthe electricians on board. This indicated some defect in the portion\r\npaid out, and the usual work of raising up again had to be once more\r\nresorted to. During this process the cable parted, and Fig. 300 shows\r\nthe scene on board the _Great Eastern_ produced by this occurrence, as\r\nrepresented by an artist of the “Illustrated London News” who\r\naccompanied the expedition. The broken cable was caught several times by\r\ngrapnels, and raised a mile or more from the bottom, but the tackle\r\nproved unable to resist the strain, and four times it broke; and after\r\nthe spot had been marked by buoys, the _Great Eastern_ steamed home to\r\nannounce the failure of the great enterprise. For this 5,500 miles of\r\ncable had altogether been made, and 4,000 miles of it lay uselessly at\r\nthe bottom of the ocean, after a million and a quarter sterling had been\r\nswallowed up in these attempts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 298.—_Making Wires for Atlantic Telegraph Cable._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 299.—_The Instrument-Room at Valentia._\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut these disasters did not crush the hopes of the promoters of the\r\ngreat enterprise, and in the following year the _Great Eastern_ again\r\nsailed with a new cable, the construction of which is shown of the\r\nactual size, in Fig. 301. In this there is a strand of seven twisted\r\ncopper wires, as before, forming the electric conductor; round this are\r\nfour coatings of gutta-percha; and surrounding these is a layer of jute,\r\nwhich is protected by ten iron wires (No 10, B.W.G) of Webster and\r\nHorsfall’s homogeneous metal, twisted spirally about the cable; and each\r\nwire is enveloped in spiral strands of Manilla hemp. The _Great Eastern_\r\nsailed on the 13th of July, and on the 28th the American end of the\r\ncable was spliced to the shore section in Newfoundland, and the two\r\ncontinents were again electrically connected. They have since been even\r\nmore so, for the cable of 1865 was eventually fished up, and its\r\nelectrical condition was found to be improved rather than injured by its\r\nsojourn at the bottom of the Atlantic. It was spliced to a new length of\r\ncable, which was successfully laid by the _Great Eastern_, and was soon\r\njoined to a Newfoundland shore cable. There were now two cables\r\nconnecting England and America, and one connecting America and France\r\nhas since been laid. At the present time upwards of 20,000 miles of\r\nsubmerged wires are in constant use in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 300.—_The Breaking of the Cable._\r\n]\r\n\r\nCertain interesting phenomena have been observed in connection with\r\nsubmarine cables, and some of the notions which were formerly\r\nentertained as to the speed of electricity have been abandoned, for it\r\nhas been ascertained that electricity cannot properly be said to have a\r\nvelocity, since the same quantity of electricity can be made to traverse\r\nthe same distance with extremely different speeds. No effect can be\r\nperceived in the most delicate instruments in Newfoundland for one-fifth\r\nof a second after contact has been made at Valentia; after the lapse of\r\nanother fifth of a second the received current has attained about seven\r\nper cent. of its greatest permanent strength, and in three seconds will\r\nhave reached it. During the whole of this time the current is flowing\r\ninto the cable at Valentia with its maximum intensity. Fig. 302\r\nexpresses these facts by a mode of representation which is extremely\r\nconvenient. Along the line O X the regular intervals of time in tenths\r\nof seconds are marked, commencing from O, and the intensity of the\r\ncurrent at each instant is expressed by the length of the upright line\r\nwhich can be drawn between O X and the curve. The curve therefore\r\nexhibits to the eye the state of the current throughout the whole time.\r\nIf after nearly a second’s contact with the battery the cable be\r\nconnected with the earth at the distant end, the rising intensity of the\r\ncurrent will be checked and then immediately begin to decline somewhat\r\nmore gradually than it rose, as indicated by the descending branch of\r\nthe curve in Fig. 302. A little reflection will show the unsuitability\r\nfor such currents of instruments which require a fixed strength to work\r\nthem. We may remark that, supposing a receiving instrument were in\r\nconnection with the Atlantic Cable which required the maximum strength\r\nof the received current to work it, the sending clerk would have to\r\nmaintain contact for three seconds before this intensity would be\r\nreached, and then, after putting the cable to earth, he would have to\r\nwait some seconds before the current had flowed out. Several seconds\r\nwould, therefore, be taken up in the transmission of one signal, whereas\r\nby means of the mirror galvanometer about one-fourteenth of this time\r\nsuffices, and the syphon recorder will write the messages twelve times\r\nas fast as the Morse instrument. The cause of the gradual rise of the\r\ncurrent at the distant end of a submarine cable must be sought for in\r\nthe fact that the coated wire plays the part of a Leyden jar, and the\r\nelectricity which pours into it is partly held by an inductive action in\r\nthe surrounding water. The importance of Sir W. Thomson’s inventions as\r\nregards rapidity of signalling, upon which the commercial success of the\r\nAtlantic Cable greatly depends, will now be understood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 301.—_Atlantic Telegraph Cable, 1866._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 302.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy furnishing the means of almost instantaneous communication between\r\ndistant places, the electric telegraph has enabled feats to be performed\r\nwhich appear strangely paradoxical when expressed in ordinary language.\r\nWhen it is mentioned as a sober fact that intelligence of an event may\r\nactually reach a place before the time of its occurrence, a very\r\nextraordinary and startling statement appears to be made, on account of\r\nthe ambiguous sense of the word _time_. Thus it appears very marvellous\r\nthat details of events which may happen in England in 1876 can be known\r\nin America in 1875, but it is certainly true; for, on account of the\r\ndifference of longitude between London and New York, the hour of the day\r\nat the latter place is about six hours behind the time at the former. It\r\nmight, therefore, well happen that an event occurring in London on the\r\nmorning of the 1st of January, 1876, might be discussed in New York on\r\nthe night of the 31st of December, 1875. There are on record many\r\nwonderful instances of the celerity with which, thanks to electricity,\r\nimportant speeches delivered at a distant place are placed before the\r\npublic by the newspapers. And there are stories in circulation\r\nconcerning incidents of a more romantic character in connection with the\r\ntelegraph. The American journals not long ago reported that a wealthy\r\nBoston merchant, having urged his daughter to marry an unwelcome suitor,\r\nthe young lady resolved upon at once uniting herself to the man of her\r\nchoice, who was then in New York, _en route_ for England. The electric\r\nwires were put in requisition; she took her place in the telegraph\r\noffice in Boston, and he in the office in New York, each accompanied by\r\na magistrate; consent was exchanged by electric currents, and the pair\r\nwere married by telegraph! It is said that the merchant threatened to\r\ndispute the validity of the marriage, but he did not carry this threat\r\ninto execution. The following _jeu d’esprit_ appeared a short time ago\r\nin “Nature,” and, we strongly suspect, has been penned by the same hand\r\nas the lines quoted from “Blackwood,” on page 508.\r\n\r\n                          ELECTRIC VALENTINE.\r\n             (_Telegraph Clerk_ ♂ _to Telegraph Clerk_ ♀.)\r\n\r\n              “‘The tendrils of my soul are twined\r\n                With thine, though many a mile apart;\r\n              And thine in close-coiled circuits wind\r\n                Around the magnet of my heart.\r\n\r\n              “‘Constant as Daniell, strong as Grove;\r\n                Seething through all its depths like Smee;\r\n              My heart pours forth its tide of love,\r\n                And all its circuits close in thee.\r\n\r\n              “‘Oh tell me, when along the line\r\n                From my full heart the message flows,\r\n              What currents are induced in thine?\r\n                One click from thee will end my woes!’\r\n\r\n              “Through many an Ohm the Weber flew,\r\n                And clicked this answer back to me—\r\n              ‘I am thy Farad, staunch and true,\r\n                Charged to a Volt with love for thee.’”\r\n\r\n  [NOTE BY THE EDITOR.—_Ohm_, standard of electric resistance; _Weber_,\r\n electric current; _Volt_, electro-motive force; _Farad_, capacity (of a\r\n                               condenser).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _THE TELEPHONE._\r\n\r\nOf more recent invention than any of the classes of instruments already\r\nmentioned for electrical communication at a distance is the telephone,\r\nwhich differs widely from the rest in many notable particulars. Though\r\nthe telephone completely realized what had for years before been the\r\ndream of physicists, the first announcement of its capabilities was\r\nreceived, even by the scientific world, with some pause of incredulity;\r\nbut when its powers were demonstrated, it created no small sensation. It\r\nhas now, within a few years afterwards, become so familiar as an\r\nappliance of ordinary life and business, that people in general are less\r\nimpressed by the wonder of it than were their fathers half a century ago\r\nby the electric telegraphs of Wheatstone and of Morse. Like all other\r\ninventions, it was led up to by preceding discoveries and tentative\r\nefforts. It will be unnecessary here to trace those successive steps\r\nwith minuteness, or to attempt to adjust the claims of merit or priority\r\nthat have been put forward for different inventors, but a notice of some\r\nof the stages in the evolution of this wonderful contrivance may be of\r\ninterest. If the reader has no previous knowledge of the physical nature\r\nof sounds in relation to music, and especially to articulate speech, he\r\nshould now refer to the brief explanation given in a subsequent chapter,\r\nat the commencement of the section on the Phonograph. He should,\r\nhowever, bear in mind that in that explanation are included some\r\nacoustical discoveries of a later date than some of the inventions we\r\nare here to speak of, or, at least, the real causes of which give other\r\nqualities than pitch to sound, had not been fully demonstrated when the\r\nnotion of the electric telephone was conceived.\r\n\r\nWhen the electric telegraph came into use and it was found possible to\r\nuse it for communication of intelligence to great distances, it is not\r\nsurprising that the further problem of transmitting by electricity, not\r\nsignals merely, but audible speech, should be suggested. Perhaps the\r\nfirst scientific person who avowed a belief in the possibility of doing\r\nthis, and even indicated the direction in which the solution of the\r\nproblem was to be sought, was a Frenchman of science, M. Charles\r\nBourseul. In 1854, he pointed out that sounds are caused by vibrations,\r\nand reach the ear by like vibrations of the intervening medium, and,\r\nalthough he could not say what took place in the modifications of the\r\norgans of speech by which syllables are produced, he inferred that these\r\nsyllables could reach the ear only by vibrations of the medium, and that\r\nif these vibrations could be reproduced the syllables would be\r\nreproduced. He suggests that a man might speak near a flexible disc,\r\nwhich the vibrations of his voice would throw into oscillatory movements\r\nthat could be caused to make and break a battery circuit, and that, at a\r\ndistance, the currents might be arranged to produce the like vibrations\r\nin another disc. The weak point of this scheme was the want of any\r\nsuggestion as to the mode in which this last effect was to be produced.\r\nEven when this part of the problem was solved in a few years afterwards,\r\nas we shall presently see, it was musical—and not articulate—sound that\r\ncould be transmitted by an arrangement, using make and break contacts.\r\nThe reader, who has understood what has been said of electrical\r\ncurrents, and also the account of the compounded vibrations in\r\narticulate sounds introduced into our section on the phonograph, should\r\nhave little difficulty in seeing this must necessarily be the case, for\r\nthe contacts could only give the succession of the vibrations by\r\ncurrents of equal intensity, and could not, like the yielding wax of the\r\nphonograph cylinder, correspond with their relative intensities. M.\r\nBourseul pointed out advantages which would arise from the transmission\r\nof speech by electricity, such as simplicity of apparatus and facility\r\nin use—for, unlike the telegraph, no skilled operators would be\r\nneeded—to signal messages, or time spent in spelling out the words\r\nletter by letter. He says that he had made some experiments, which\r\npromised a favourable result, but demanded time and patience, and that\r\nhe is certain that, in a more or less distant future, speech will be\r\ntransmitted by electricity, so that what is spoken in Vienna may be\r\nheard in Paris. One cannot help thinking that if M. Bourseul had but\r\npursued his experiments a little longer, he would not improbably have\r\nachieved the invention of the speaking telephone, for which the world\r\nhad to wait twenty years longer. As it is, we cannot but admire his\r\nscientific foresight and his confidence in the ultimate realization of\r\nhis idea.\r\n\r\nBut before this came to pass, an intermediate stage was reached in the\r\napparatus contrived by M. Reiss, a schoolmaster of Friedrichsdorf, who,\r\nin 1860, solved the problem of electrically transmitting musical tones.\r\nSo far as concerned the reproduction of the sounds, this telephone was\r\nfounded upon a discovery, made in 1837, by an American physicist, named\r\nPage, which was this: At the moment a bar of iron is magnetized, by\r\nsending a current through a coil surrounding it, as shown in Fig. 265, a\r\nslight but sharp click is heard. The transmitting apparatus was, in\r\nprinciple, Mr. Scott’s phono-autograph (described in the section on the\r\nphonograph), which had been invented in 1855. The tracing style of this\r\nwas replaced in Reiss’ apparatus by a small disc of platinum, connected\r\nby a very light spring of the same metal with a binding-screw for the\r\nbattery connection. Nearly in contact with the little disc was a\r\nplatinum point, so arranged that the slightest oscillation of the\r\nmembrane would bring them into actual contact and thus close the\r\ncircuit. Worthy of remark is the very primitive nature of the materials\r\nwith which Reiss made his first experimental apparatus. The receptacle\r\nfor the voice was simply a large bung hollowed out into a conical\r\ncavity, and the membrane was supplied by the skin of a German sausage,\r\nwhile the clicking bar of the receiver was a stout knitting needle,\r\nsurrounded by a coil of covered copper wire and stuck into the bridge of\r\na violin, which, by acting as a sounding board, made the clicks produced\r\nin the needle distinctly audible. M. Reiss finally produced his\r\ntelephone in the form shown in Fig. 302_a_, where _I_ is the receiver;\r\n_B_, the voltaic battery; _I I_, the receiver; _c c_ is a coil of\r\ninsulated wire, surrounding a slender iron rod, mounted on the supports,\r\n_f f_, which rest on the sounding board, _g g_. The transmitter consists\r\nof the hollow box, _A_, provided with a trumpet-mouthed opening in one\r\nside and having at the top a circular piece cut out, across which is\r\nstretched a membrane with the little disc of platinum, _n_, fixed in its\r\ncentre. When a person applying his mouth to A sings into the box, the\r\nmembrane is thrown into vibrations corresponding with the notes, and at\r\neach vibration a contact is made and a click is emitted from the distant\r\nsounding box. The tones are concentrated by covering this box with the\r\nperforated lid. It was afterwards found that a trumpet mouth fitted into\r\nthe receiver was still more effective. Reiss tried to use his\r\narrangement for transmitting speech, but without success, although\r\noccasionally a syllable could be very indistinctly heard. An instrument,\r\nwith springs so nicely adjusted that slight vibrations did not separate\r\nthe platinum from actual contact, but merely caused change of pressure,\r\nhas indeed been made to convey articulate sounds, although the\r\narrangement was not essentially different from that of M. Reiss. This\r\nmode of action is, however, a different thing, and we shall presently\r\nsee that very effective speech transmitters have been constructed by\r\napplying it in a more refined way. This musical telephone could give the\r\npitch of the sounds in the song but not their quality (_timbre_), and\r\nthe receiver added to the main system of vibration other sets that\r\nbelonged to itself, the result being a shrill and by no means pleasing\r\ntone, recalling that of a penny trumpet. Messrs. C. and L. Wray\r\nafterwards effected some considerable improvements in M. Reiss’s\r\ntelephone, with the object of intensifying the effects and producing\r\nbetter tones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 302_a_.—_Reiss’ Musical Telephone._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 302_b_.—_Bell’s Musical Telephone._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA further step towards the speaking telephone may be illustrated by an\r\nearlier invention of Mr. Graham Bell, a native of Scotland, who had\r\nsettled in the United States. Mr. Bell’s inventions, it may be\r\nmentioned, were by no means the results of fortunate accidents or of\r\nunsought and spontaneous flashes of conception, but rather the outcome\r\nof long, patient and systematic studies. His father, Mr. Alexander\r\nMelville Bell, of Edinburgh, had assiduously cultivated acoustic\r\nscience, and had in conjunction with his son, undertaken special\r\nresearches into the mechanism of the organs of speech, the elements of\r\narticulate speech in different languages, and the musical components of\r\nvocal sounds. When Graham afterwards pursued these studies in the light\r\nof the fuller investigation carried out by Helmholtz, he was naturally\r\nled to the application of electricity to acoustic transmission. After\r\nsome experiments in the production of vowel sounds by combinations of\r\nelectric tuning forks, he invented a telephone for reproducing musical\r\nsounds at a distance, which was a great improvement on that of Reiss,\r\nand involved another principle, which indeed is the same as that\r\nutilized in his more mature invention of the speaking telephone. As a\r\nlike explanation of the action would apply in both cases, the reader\r\nwill find his advantage in following the observations we have to make on\r\nthe earlier instrument. This consisted of what was virtually two sets of\r\nelectric tuning forks, each set being acted upon by one electro-magnet.\r\nFig. 302_b_ will suffice to show the general form of the arrangement. A\r\nplate of steel is bent twice at right angles longitudinally, and is\r\nmagnetized so that any transverse slice of it would constitute an\r\nordinary horse shoe magnet. This is seen endways in Fig. 302_b_ at M,\r\nand N. and S. will indicate the north and south poles respectively. To\r\neach limb of this broad magnet is attached a plate of steel, T, cut into\r\nteeth, just in the same way as the steel plate in a common musical box\r\nor mechanical piano, except that the teeth are not pointed. These are\r\ntuned to give severally in pairs the notes of the musical scale when\r\nthrown into vibration. Between the prongs of the series of tuning forks\r\nthus formed is an electro-magnet, L, made of a bar of soft iron, I,\r\nwound longitudinally by a coil, one end of which makes an earth\r\nconnection at E and the other is connected by the wire, W W´, to\r\ncomplete the circuit through the coil of the distant apparatus. It will\r\nbe observed that the receiving and transmitting instruments are exactly\r\nalike. Now, suppose one of these teeth is struck or otherwise thrown\r\ninto vibration, the result will be, since the free ends of the teeth are\r\nmagnetic poles, that alternating electric currents will be generated in\r\nthe coil of the electro-magnet (see page 509), and these will flow\r\nthrough the entire circuit, including the coil of the distant\r\ninstrument, where the magnetism generated will alternately attract and\r\nrepel the polar extremities of the teeth in the steel plate. It will be\r\nunderstood, of course, that the fellow prong of the fork will vibrate\r\nalso, and will simultaneously approach to and recede from the soft iron\r\ncore, so that being of opposite polarity, the effect on the\r\nelectro-magnet will be doubled. The action on the distant electro-magnet\r\nwill be a rapid series of reversals of the polarities of the core, and\r\nhundreds of times in every second the ends of the steel teeth will be\r\nalternately attracted and repelled. But not all of these will thereby be\r\nthrown into vibration—only the one pair which were tuned into unison\r\nwith the former can and will respond to that particular series of\r\nimpulses, and the consequence will be that the same note will be emitted\r\nby the receiving instrument. If two or more notes of the transmitter be\r\nsimultaneously thrown into vibration, the same notes will be heard from\r\nthe receiver, for each series of currents will flow along the wire\r\nindependently, just as if the other did not exist, and each will produce\r\nits particular effect on the transmitter. In this way an air played on\r\nthe one instrument is heard also from the other, with all its accents\r\nand combinations. But more than this, if a tune be played on a musical\r\ninstrument near the sender, or if a song be sung, the air will be\r\nreproduced by the distant receiver. The reason of this is that the steel\r\ntongues take up, or are thrown into movement by, the vibrations that\r\nhave the same periodicity. The manner in which a vibratory body responds\r\nto impulses of its own periodicity may be easily shown by exposing the\r\nwires of a piano and raising the dampers, when, if a note be sung near\r\nthe instrument, it will be found that a number of the wires respond,\r\nnamely, those that are capable of vibrating synchronously with the\r\nconstituent vibrations of the voice, for neither a voice nor a sounding\r\nwire gives forth one simple system of vibrations, the audible effect\r\nbeing due to the superposition or composition of several diverse\r\nelementary systems. With the same arrangement another experiment may be\r\nmade, as an illustration of a matter important for our subject. Let the\r\ndifferent vowels be sung to the piano-wire on the same note or pitch,\r\nand in the responses to each a difference of the quality of the sound\r\nwill be noticed, although the piano will not distinctly give back the\r\nvowel itself. It would, however, do so if a number of its wires were\r\nstrung with certain definite relations in pitch to that of the\r\nfundamental note and in unison with the voice components of the vowel\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 302_c_.—_Superposition of Currents._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has been said above that two systems of electrical currents of\r\ndifferent periodicity would flow along one wire independently of each\r\nother, but it should be explained that this takes place by a composition\r\nof the currents, for it is evident that at any given instant the wire\r\ncan only be in one of three conditions, viz.: (1) with no current\r\nflowing; (2) with a current in the positive direction; (3) with a\r\ncurrent in the negative direction. Such must always be the case, and,\r\ntherefore, it should be clearly understood how this is consistent with\r\nthe superposition of currents of different periodicities, a matter which\r\nthe diagram, Fig. 302_c_, is intended to illustrate. Suppose the _flow\r\nof time_ to be represented by the dotted lines from _a_ to _b_, the\r\nwhole length of which we may call 1/100th of a second, and that the\r\ncurrent passing through the wire is represented in intensity and\r\ndirection by the plain lines; the intensity by distance above or below\r\nthe dotted line; the direction being positive where the plain line is\r\nabove, and negative when it is below the dotted straight line, and of\r\ncourse no current at all occurs at the instant when the change of\r\ndirection takes place. The line A will thus represent alternating\r\ncurrents, rising and sinking in intensity, and changing from one\r\ndirection to the other, going through 600 regularly recurring phases in\r\none second of time. Similarly, B may represent another series of\r\ncurrents, having here a periodicity of 500 in one second of time. These\r\nare here supposed to have greater intensity than the former. If the two\r\ncurrents are sent through one wire their effects are superposed, so that\r\nthe actual electrical state of the wire would be represented by the\r\ncurve C, which is compounded from the two others, and where it will be\r\nobserved the rise and fall of the current, its maxima and minima, no\r\nlonger recur at regular intervals within the space of the 1/100th of the\r\nsecond, the whole of that period being taken up by a less regular series\r\nof changes, the cycle being repeated only 100 times in the second. The\r\nsame diagram might serve to illustrate the motions of, say, a particle\r\nof air or the drum of the ear in acoustic vibration, the distances above\r\nand below the straight line being taken to represent the displacements\r\nfrom the position of rest on one side and the other. If the sounds of an\r\norgan or piano consisted of only these primary vibrations, B would\r\nroughly[8] represent the movements of the wires, the air and the drum of\r\nthe ear, when the note _si_{3}_ was sounded alone; A when the note\r\n_re_{4}_ was more faintly sounded alone, and then C, if these notes were\r\nsounded together, would correspond with the movements of the drum of the\r\near. The movements it actually makes when we hear speech, or even a\r\nsingle musical note, are, however, a thousand-fold more complex, for no\r\nmusical instrument gives out a note with a single set of vibrations, the\r\nfundamental one being always accompanied by other sets diversely related\r\nto it, according to the class of instrument. In some cases, fifteen or\r\nsixteen sets of vibrations have been distinguished along with the\r\nfundamental note, without exhausting the possible number. Of a like\r\norder of complexity will be the currents which the wire of a speaking\r\ntelephone must convey, and the difference between the undulatory nature\r\nof the currents in Bell’s musical telephone and any produced by mere\r\nmake and break contacts, as in Reiss’ arrangement, will be obvious, and\r\nrecognized as an important step towards the solution of the problem of\r\ntransmitting speech. When Mr. Bell invented his instrument, he was\r\nseeking for a method of simultaneously transmitting by one wire several\r\nmessages by audible _signs_ merely; and by the method used in his\r\nmusical telephone this is practicable, for all that would be required\r\nwould be pairs of transmitters and receivers, each adjusted to one\r\nsingle particular note. Another point that should be noted is that in\r\nthe Bell musical telephone no battery is used, for the currents are\r\nthose generated by magneto-electric induction, and the circuit through\r\nthe wires and coils are completed by earth connections.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  The lines A and B in the diagram have not harmonic ordinates.\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 302_d_.—_Bell’s Speaking Telephone._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn passing from the invention of the musical to that of the speaking\r\ntelephone, Mr. Bell passed from the more complex to the more simple\r\ninstrument, for of all apparatus by which communication can be carried\r\non at a distance, the Bell speaking telephone is one of the simplest. He\r\nhad only to make its vibrating disc of Scott’s phono-autograph into a\r\nmagnetized body, capable of producing currents in an electro-magnet coil\r\nin the same way as did the vibrating plates in his musical telephone.\r\nThe Bell speaking telephone was publicly exhibited for the first time at\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1876, and was shown the same year to the British\r\nAssociation by Sir William Thomson, who pronounced it the wonder of\r\nwonders. For the first time in England, the instrument in a still\r\nsimpler form was exhibited by Mr. Preece, at the Plymouth meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in 1877, and of nearly the same construction as is\r\nstill often used, although, as we shall presently see, for battery\r\ntelephones the transmitting apparatus is now made of larger dimensions,\r\nof a different shape and on a different principle. We shall describe the\r\nsimple form in which transmitter and receiver are identical, each\r\nconsisting externally of a small cylindrical wooden or ebonite box, and\r\nwith a handle three or four inches in length of the same material. Fig.\r\n302_d_ is a section of the instrument where N S is a cylindrical steel\r\nmagnet, on one end of which is wound the small coil B, made of fine silk\r\ncovered copper wire, the extremities of which pass through the handle M\r\nat _f f_, and are connected by the binding screws _I I´_ with the line\r\nwire C C´. Close to the coil covered end of the magnet is a very thin\r\ndiaphragm of iron, L L´, and when this is thrown into vibration by the\r\nvoice speaking into the trumpet-mouth opening, R R´, its movements\r\nproduce currents in the coil according to the principles that have\r\nalready been explained, for it will be observed that the iron disc is\r\nmagnetized by the inductive action of the permanent magnet N S. These\r\ncurrents passing through the coil of the receiving instrument raise or\r\nlower the intensity of the magnetic force in it, so that the distant\r\ndisc reproduces the vibrations of the transmitter. Such is at least an\r\nobvious explanation of the action of this very simple arrangement; but\r\nfrom a number of experiments and observations that have been made with\r\nmodifications of the instruments, it would appear that other and much\r\nmore complex phenomena concur in producing the effects. It has indeed\r\nbeen suggested—and the idea is supported by numerous experiments—that,\r\nin these telephonic transmissions of speech, vibrations are concerned\r\nwhich are not at all of the mechanical kind we have been dealing with in\r\nthese explanations, but are _molecular_.\r\n\r\nThe Bell telephone is used by speaking distinctly before the mouth-piece\r\nof the transmitter, while the listener at the other end of the line\r\napplies the mouth-piece of his instrument to his ear, and one wire is\r\nsufficient with good earth connections, although sometimes a second wire\r\nis employed to complete the circuit. It is also found advantageous to\r\nhave two instruments in the circuit at each end, so that one may be held\r\nto the ear while the operator is speaking through the other. In this\r\nway, a rapid conversation can be carried on with the greatest ease, or\r\nagain, an instrument may be held at each ear, by which arrangement the\r\nwords are more distinctly heard. It is not necessary to shout, as this\r\nhas no effect, but to speak with a clear intonation, and some voices are\r\nfound to suit better than others. The vowel sounds are best transmitted,\r\nexcept that of the English _e_, which, with the letters _g_, _j_, _k_,\r\nand _q_, are always somewhat imperfectly transmitted. A song is very\r\ndistinctly heard, both in the words and the air, and the voice of the\r\nperson singing is readily recognized. Several instruments may be\r\nincluded in one circuit at different stations, so that half a dozen\r\npersons may take part in a conversation, and questions and answers may\r\nbe understood even when crossing each other. If two distinct telephone\r\ncircuits have their wires laid for a certain distance (two miles) near\r\neach other, say a foot or more apart, and without any connection\r\nwhatever, listeners at the end of the one line will hear the\r\nconversation exchanged through the other line. Other forms of the\r\ninstruments have been arranged, by which a large audience may hear\r\nsounds produced at a distance, as, for instance, when a cornet-à-piston\r\nwas played in London, it was heard by thousands of people assembled in\r\nthe Corn Exchange at Basingstoke.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible within our limits to even briefly describe the\r\ngreat number of improvements and modifications of Bell’s system that\r\nwere devised by various persons soon after the invention was brought\r\nout, and many additional complications were introduced into some of the\r\narrangements. Advantage was also taken to a greater or less extent of\r\nanother principle affecting the strength of electric currents, to which\r\nwe have now to call the reader’s attention, and to exemplify by one of\r\nthe simplest instruments, leaving detailed accounts of the various forms\r\nin which it has been applied to be found in special treatises. The\r\nreader should first turn back to page 400, where he will see an\r\nexpression of the strength of a battery current. It will be observed\r\nthat the current may be increased or diminished by diminishing or\r\nincreasing R, the external resistance, without changing the other terms.\r\nNow M. Du Moncel discovered, as far back as 1856, that an increase of\r\npressure between two conductors in contact, and conveying a current,\r\ncaused a diminution of the electrical resistance, and this discovery was\r\nutilized for telephonic purposes by Mr. Edison in his invention of the\r\ncarbon transmitter (1876). In this there is no magnet, and a stretched\r\nmembrane may take the place of the metallic plate, although a circle of\r\nphotographers’ ferro-type plate gives better results. A pad of\r\nindia-rubber, cork, or other material is fixed on the plate, and rests\r\nupon a carbon disc, which again is in contact with a metallic conductor.\r\nBetween the latter and the carbon the current from a constant battery\r\npasses. When the plate is thrown into vibration by speaking into the\r\nmouth-piece, the variations of pressure conveyed to the carbon cause\r\nvariations in the resistance of its electrical contact, and thus a\r\nseries of undulations are produced in the current, and these affect the\r\nelectro-magnet of a Bell receiving instrument in the circuit as before,\r\nso that the sounds are reproduced. It is now time to say a word about\r\nthe share in the invention of the speaking telephone which has been\r\nclaimed by Mr. Elisha Gray, also of the United States, who, at the time\r\nMr. Bell applied for the patent for his instruments, produced drawings\r\nand descriptions of a plan he had devised for transmitting speech by\r\nundulating electrical currents, and it has been admitted that the plan\r\nhe had conceived was perfect in principle. He proposed to use a battery\r\ncurrent, and his receiving instrument was nearly the same as Bell’s. The\r\nundulations of the current were also determined, as in Edison’s\r\ntelephone, by changes in the external resistance, but this was effected\r\nin a different, though equally simple manner. To a membrane stretched\r\nacross the lower end of a short wide tube that formed the mouth-piece of\r\nthe transmitter, and was placed vertically, was attached a piece of\r\nplatinum wire, conveying the current and dipping into a liquid of\r\nmoderate conductivity, but not quite touching another platinum electrode\r\nfixed at the bottom of the vessel containing the liquid. The space of\r\nliquid traversed by the current being thus varied by the oscillations of\r\nthe membrane, the resulting variations of the resistance produced the\r\nrequisite undulations in the intensity of the current. Both Mr. Bell and\r\nMr. Gray applied for patents on the 14th February, 1876, but the\r\nAmerican Patent Office recognized the claim of the former as prior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 302_e_.—_Mr. Hughes’ Microphone._\r\n\r\n  (B _and_ R _are merely diagrammatic_.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nDu Moncel’s observation was applied by Mr. Hughes in the construction of\r\nan instrument, which he named the _microphone_. This was in the same\r\nyear that Edison had brought out his carbon telephone, and a certain\r\nsimilarity, resulting from the identity of the principle employed, led\r\nto an acrimonious controversy on what were supposed to be rival claims.\r\nBut the microphone differs so much in arrangement and performance from\r\nthe other instrument as to constitute a distinct invention. The\r\ninstrument, if it may be so called, is simplicity itself, in the form\r\nrepresented in Fig. 302_e_, which is one of the most sensitive. There, C\r\nand C´ are two small blocks of carbon, fixed on a small upright piece of\r\nwood. Two cup shaped cavities are hollowed out in the carbon blocks, and\r\nthese serve to hold loosely, in a nearly vertical position, a small rod\r\nof gas retort carbon pointed at the ends. This rod is only about one\r\ninch in length, and the lower end merely rests on the bottom of the cup\r\nin C´, while the other is capable of moving about in the upper cavity,\r\nthe vertical position being nearly maintained in a state of unstable\r\nequilibrium. The carbons are in the circuit of a voltaic cell or small\r\nbattery, B, in the line through a Bell receiving instrument, which may\r\nbe at a distance. When the microphone is to be used, it is placed on a\r\ntable with a cushion or several folds of wadding beneath its base. If\r\nthe receiver be applied to the ear of a listener, he will distinctly\r\nhear every word pronounced by one speaking near the microphone, even in\r\na low tone; but a loud voice may be heard when the speaker is 20 or 30\r\nfeet from the instrument. The minutest vibrations conveyed to the stand\r\nare perceived at the receiver as loud noises. The tread of a fly walking\r\nover the board, S, is heard like the tramp of a horse, and the ticks of\r\na watch are audible in the receiver when the ear is several inches away\r\nfrom it. The slight touch of a feather on the stand is distinctly\r\naudible, and a current of air impinging upon it is reproduced as the\r\nnoise of a stream of water. The microphone is, in fact, the most\r\nsensitive detector of vibrations that is known, and its employment as a\r\ntransmitter has brought the telephone to its present perfection. It has\r\nbeen constructed in an endless variety of forms, according to the\r\npurposes for which it is intended, and its simplicity is as wonderful as\r\nits extreme sensitiveness. We will further illustrate these qualities by\r\nan experiment of Mr. Willoughby Smith’s on the same principle. Instead\r\nof the two carbon blocks, he laid on the table, in parallel positions,\r\ntwo small rat tail files, and completed the circuit by a third file,\r\nlaid across the others at right angles. This arrangement constituted so\r\nsensitive a transmitter that the listener at the distant Bell receiver\r\ncould hear even the faint sound of the speaker’s breathing. Even three\r\ncommon pins, similarly crossed, make an effective transmitter. The\r\nfeebleness of the variations in the current requisite to make the Bell\r\nreceiver produce sounds is extraordinary, and a very weak battery\r\ncurrent is sufficient, even under the circumstances of ordinary\r\npractical use. Still more remarkable is the fact that in favourable\r\nconditions the microphone is capable of transmitting sound without any\r\nbattery at all, but merely with connections to earth, when the ticking\r\nof a watch placed upon the stand has been distinctly heard at the\r\ndistance of nearly one-third of a mile, and speech, also, has been\r\ntransmitted with unusual distinctness with the battery left out and\r\nmerely a few drops of water placed at the carbon contacts; indeed, it is\r\nsaid that, even without the water, the voice may be heard. This effect\r\nhas been attributed to the carbons and water forming a battery\r\nthemselves, and in the latter to the moisture of the speaker’s breath\r\nsupplying the fluid element. But, again, the microphone will not only\r\ntransmit speech, but, under certain arrangements, it will reproduce it\r\n(when one of the carbon electrodes is attached to a membrane), although\r\nthe result is less distinct than with the Bell receiver. It is, however,\r\nnot so easy to explain how mere variations of current intensity can\r\nproduce the effect where there can be no magnetic attractions and\r\nrepulsions. We must, no doubt, look for the cause in some other property\r\nof electric currents. The transmitters used in various lines of\r\ntelephonic communication, erected by the Post Office or by companies in\r\nGreat Britain, are generally applications of the principle of the\r\nmicrophone, and not of that of either Mr. Bell’s or Mr. Edison’s\r\noriginal instrument. But more recently, Mr. Edison has most ingeniously\r\nadapted variations of sliding friction, as modified by the action of the\r\nundulatory current on a liquid electrolyte between the sliding surfaces\r\nto the production of a loud speaking telephonic receiver—that is, one by\r\nwhich the sounds are made audible to a large assembly. From this\r\ninstrument, the notes of a cornet-à-piston, played in Brighton, have\r\nbeen distinctly heard throughout a large hall in London.\r\n\r\nAnother curious transmitter is formed of a fine jet of water traversed\r\nby an electric current. Acoustic vibrations are easily set up in the\r\njet, and these modify its conductivity so as to produce corresponding\r\nundulations of current intensity.\r\n\r\nIt would take long to point out the many scientific applications of so\r\nsensitive an instrument as the microphone with its Bell receiver. As a\r\nmedium for conveying speech to a distance, whether for purposes of peace\r\nor war, its use is sufficiently obvious. Some curiosities of musical\r\ntransmission have been noticed, and such experiments are repeated from\r\ntime to time with increasing success. It has been applied to many\r\npurposes in surgery and medicine. In many cases of deafness it has made\r\nconversation easy. Even the passage of the molecules of gases, when\r\ndiffusing through porous partitions, Mr. Chandler Roberts has by its\r\nmeans made audible. The distances to which speech can now be transmitted\r\nare considerable, as conversations have been carried on by persons\r\nnearly 300 miles apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LIGHTHOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho does not regard with interest the lighthouses which at night throw\r\ntheir friendly beams across the sea, to guide the mariner in his course,\r\nand warn him of perils from sunken rock or treacherous shoal? The modern\r\nlighthouse, with its beautiful appliances, is entirely the result of the\r\napplied science of our age; and it affords a fine example of the manner\r\nin which experiments, carried on to determine natural laws apparently of\r\nan abstract character and without any obvious direct utility, give rise\r\nto inventions of the highest importance and most extended usefulness.\r\nThe lofty structures which were erected near certain ancient harbours,\r\nand of which the Pharos of Alexandria is the most memorable example,\r\nburned on their summits open fires of wood; and whatever beacons existed\r\nfrom that time down to the end of last century were merely blazing fires\r\nof wood or coal. The lighthouses of the South Foreland, which were\r\nestablished in 1634, displayed coal fires until 1790, and the\r\nlighthouses in the Isle of Man were first illuminated with oil only in\r\n1816. Down to the beginning of the present century, therefore, the\r\nmodern lighthouses showed no improvement on the ancient plan. Even the\r\nTour de Cordouan, at the mouth of the Garonne river, which was completed\r\nin 1610, and is one of the most famous of modern lighthouses, from its\r\ngreat height (200 ft.), and the care which has always been given to\r\nrender it efficient, showed down to 1780 merely a fire of billets of\r\nwood, the upward loss of the light being diminished by a rude reflector\r\nin the form of an inverted cone. In the improved means of obtaining\r\nartificial light, and in the admirable optical apparatus by which that\r\nlight is utilized, we find the vast superiority of modern lighthouses.\r\nBut these are sometimes erected on isolated, and almost submerged,\r\nrocks, exposed to the fury of the waves. The difficulties which have to\r\nbe overcome in their construction cause some lighthouse towers to rank\r\namong the best specimens of engineering skill. We may, therefore,\r\nconsider under the present head—the towers; the sources of light; the\r\noptical apparatus and its accessories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 303.—_The Eddystone Lighthouse._\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the best-known lighthouses on the English coast is that on the\r\nEddystone Rock, about 14 miles S.S.W. from Plymouth. The structure which\r\nnow[9] stands upon this rock was the work of Smeaton, and was completed\r\nin 1759. The stones forming the lower courses of this tower, which is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 303, half in section and half in elevation, are\r\ndovetailed into the rock itself and into each other. The masonry is\r\ncarried up in a solid mass for about 12 ft., the stone used being\r\ngranite, which also constitutes the whole of the exterior masonry. The\r\nfour upper apartments are formed with arched roofs, the side-thrust of\r\nwhich is counteracted by iron chains surrounding the tower. These\r\nchains, which are bedded in lead, were placed in their positions while\r\nhot, and by their contraction bound the structure together with great\r\nforce. The masonry of the tower is 68 ft. high, and this is surmounted\r\nby the light-room, the total height from the lowest course of stonework\r\nto the gilt ball at the top being 94 ft., or nearly half that of the\r\nLondon Monument. The diameter at the base is 26 ft., and that at the top\r\n15 ft. The light-room is of an octagonal shape, and is made of iron\r\nframework, glazed with thick plate glass. Below this are two\r\nstore-rooms, a kitchen, and a bed-room. The Eddystone has now breasted\r\nthe storms of more than a hundred years, and it remains as firm as the\r\nrock it is built on. Fig. 304 is a picture of this noble lighthouse,\r\nwith the British fleet passing close to it, during a furious gale on the\r\n22nd of October, 1859, or exactly a century after the completion of the\r\nstructure. The incident of the man in the water, which occupies the\r\nforeground, is not an imaginary one, for it is recorded that the\r\n_Trafalgar_ stopped in the midst of the storm to pick up a man who had\r\nfallen overboard. For eighteen hours the ships encountered the fury of\r\nthe tempest, keeping out at sea in open order throughout the night. They\r\nwore in at dawn, came up the Channel in line of battle, steamed into\r\nPortland, and took up their anchorage without the loss of a sail, a\r\nspar, or a rope-yarn.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Smeaton’s tower proving unsafe, has since been taken down and\r\n  replaced, in 1882, by one from Mr. Douglass’ design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 304.—_The Eddystone in a Storm._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe lighthouse tower on the Bell Rock is 100 ft. high, 42 ft. in\r\ndiameter at the base, and 15 ft. at the top. The Inchcape Rock, on which\r\nit is placed, is the scene of Southey’s ballad of “Ralph the Rover,” and\r\nthe lighthouse here is one of the most serviceable on the Scottish\r\ncoast, for the dangerous spot on which it is placed lies in the direct\r\ntrack of all vessels entering the Firth of Tay from the German Ocean.\r\nThe rock is submerged at spring tides to the depth of 12 ft. The tower\r\nbears a close resemblance in shape to that of the Eddystone: it is\r\ncircular and faced with massive blocks of granite. The lower part, to\r\nthe height of 30 ft., is solid, and the door is reached by a bronze\r\nladder. The building contains five apartments, and a cistern for storing\r\nfresh water for the use of the keepers, who have sometimes to remain in\r\ntheir solitary situation for six or eight weeks together, the weather\r\npreventing the possibility of any communication with the shore.\r\n\r\nStill loftier than the tower on the Bell Rock is that which rises in the\r\nmidst of the Skerryvore Reef, 12 miles from Tyree, a small island off\r\nthe coast of Argyleshire. This building may be taken as a typical\r\nspecimen of a detached lighthouse, and the difficulties overcome in its\r\nconstruction attest the skill of the engineer, Mr. Alan Stevenson, who\r\nhas written a highly interesting account of the work. The rocks here are\r\nof _gneiss_, an extremely hard formation, and their surfaces are worn as\r\nsmooth as glass by the action of the water. On one of a numerous series\r\nof these small islets, where only a narrow strip of rock, a few feet\r\nwide, remains above the surface at high water, and this divided by\r\nrugged lumps into narrow gullies, through which the sea constantly\r\nrushes, the lighthouse is built. The work was commenced in 1838 by the\r\nerection of a temporary wooden barrack on piles at a little distance\r\nfrom the site chosen for the foundation. In a gale during the winter the\r\nwhole of this structure was swept away in one night. Another, more\r\nstrongly secured, was built the following summer, and in this Mr.\r\nStevenson and his men remained sometimes for fourteen days together, the\r\nweather preventing any passage to or from the shore: here the men were\r\nsometimes awakened from their hard-earned repose by the water pouring\r\nover the roof, and by its rushing through the crevices, while the\r\nerection swayed and reeled on its supports. Mr. Stevenson relates that\r\none night the men became so alarmed for the stability of their shelter\r\nthat some descended, and sought in cold and darkness a firmer footing on\r\nthe rocks. Two summers were occupied in cutting the foundations, and the\r\nblasting of the rock in so narrow a space was an operation attended with\r\nno little danger. A small harbour had to be formed at the rocks for the\r\nvessels bringing the ready-prepared stones of the building from the\r\nquarries, where also piers were built expressly for the shipment of the\r\nmaterials. In designing his tower, the engineer preferred to oppose the\r\nforce of the waves by the weight of his structure, rather than to rely\r\non dovetailed or joggled-jointed stones. Measurements were made of the\r\nforce of the waves, which at Skerryvore was sometimes equivalent to a\r\npressure of 4,335 lbs. on the square foot; and calculations based on\r\nthese measurements showed that the mere weight of the superstructure\r\nwould amply suffice to keep the stones immovable. Nearly 59,000 cubic\r\nfeet of stone were used, or about five times the quantity contained in\r\nthe Eddystone Lighthouse, and the total cost of the building was\r\n£87,000.\r\n\r\nThe use of iron, as a building material advantageously replacing stone,\r\nhas extended to lighthouses, and many have been constructed entirely of\r\ncast and wrought iron, or partly of iron and partly of gun-metal, which\r\nis not readily acted on by the sea spray. Such lighthouses are cheap,\r\neasily and quickly erected, strong enough to bear shocks and vibrations,\r\nand proof against fire, lightning, and earthquakes. The lighthouse on\r\nMorant Point, Jamaica, is made of iron, cast in England; and it was\r\nerected in a few months at a cost of one-third of that of a stone tower\r\nof the same altitude. Its height is 105 ft., and the shaft is formed of\r\niron plates in segments of 10 ft. high, which are bolted together at\r\ntheir flanges. At Gibbs Hill, Bermuda, is a lighthouse 130 ft. high,\r\nconstructed in the same manner.\r\n\r\nSo inefficient, inconvenient, and uncertain were the lamps or other\r\nmeans of artificial illumination known up to nearly the beginning of the\r\npresent century, that nothing better could be found for the Eddystone\r\nLighthouse for forty years after its erection than tallow candles stuck\r\nin a hoop—a means of illumination which would scarcely now be tolerated\r\neven in a booth at a village fair. To M. Argand, a Frenchman, we are\r\nindebted for the first great improvement in lamps. The admirable\r\ninvention which bears his name is, as everybody knows, an oil lamp with\r\na tubular wick, which occupies the annular space between two metallic\r\ntubes, in such a manner that a current of air rises through the inner\r\ntube, and thus reaches the interior of the flame. This current, and the\r\ncurrent which supplies the exterior, are increased by surrounding the\r\nflame with a tall glass chimney; and a contraction of the chimney, just\r\nabove the flame, aids greatly in distributing the air, so as to insure\r\nthe complete combustion of the oil. In the original lamp the supply of\r\noil to the flame depended on the capillary attraction in the meshes of\r\nthe wick. M. Carcel applied clockwork to continuously pump up the oil\r\ninto the burner, so that, by overflowing, it was maintained at an\r\ninvariable level. This arrangement added greatly to the intensity and\r\nsteadiness of the light; and, on account of the uniformity of its flame,\r\nthe Carcel lamp has been selected as a standard to which, in France,\r\nphotometric determinations are referred.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Argand lamp, as employed in lighthouses, is greatly\r\nincreased by the plan of employing several concentric wicks instead of\r\none. Between these wicks there are, of course, open spaces, through\r\nwhich the air obtains access to the flame, and the current of air is\r\nmade more rapid by the use of a very tall chimney. The large amount of\r\nheat produced by the combustion of so much oil in a small space is\r\npartly carried off by the excess of oil which is made to overflow the\r\nburner—about four times the quantity consumed being constantly pumped up\r\ninto the burner for this purpose. Lighthouse lamps are made with two,\r\nthree, and four wicks; and the oil is forced up in the burners either by\r\nclockwork or by the pressure of a piston loaded with a weight. The\r\nfollowing table gives the sizes of the burners and the illuminating\r\npowers of the lamps:\r\n\r\n                   ┌──────┬──────┬────────┬─────────┐\r\n                   │Order │Number│Diameter│Intensity│\r\n                   │  of  │  of  │   in   │of Light │\r\n                   │Light.│Wicks.│inches. │in Carcel│\r\n                   │      │      │        │ Lamps.  │\r\n                   ├──────┼──────┼────────┼─────────┤\r\n                   │  1   │  4   │3½      │       23│\r\n                   │  2   │  3   │2–15/16 │       15│\r\n                   │  3   │  2   │1¾      │        5│\r\n                   └──────┴──────┴────────┴─────────┘\r\n\r\nThe quantity of oil consumed in these lamps is less than that\r\nproportional to the increase of the light:—for example, although the\r\nfour-wick lamp gives twenty-three times the light of the simple Argand,\r\nit only consumes nineteen times the quantity of oil. The oil used in\r\nthese lamps is colza; but experiments have been made with a view of\r\nintroducing petroleum, which has the advantages, not only of being\r\ncheaper and uncongealable by cold, but of giving a whiter and more\r\nbrilliant light. Hitherto, however, this substance has answered only\r\nwith lamps of one wick.\r\n\r\nCoal-gas has been applied to the illumination of lighthouses, and as it\r\ngives a light of great brilliancy and steadiness, when consumed in\r\nproper burners, it has certain advantages over oil lamps, which have\r\ncaused it to be employed in situations where a supply can be readily\r\nobtained. The light produced by lime, ignited by the combustion of\r\ncoal-gas or hydrogen mixed with oxygen, has also been suggested; but\r\nthis plan is not without risk of interruptions and of dangerous\r\naccidents, and it has been considered inadvisable to entrust the\r\napparatus to the persons who commonly take charge of lighthouses.\r\n\r\nThe electric light has been very successfully applied in certain\r\nlighthouses, since the mode of producing steady currents by\r\nmagneto-electric[10] machines has come into use. The lighthouses at the\r\nSouth Foreland have been thus illuminated by a machine constructed by\r\nMr. Holmes in 1862. A very powerful electric light is exhibited from the\r\nlighthouse on Cape Grisnez; and the adoption of this source of light has\r\nbeen extending, as it is far more intense than any other artificial\r\nlight, and can be sent in more concentrated beams across the sea, on\r\naccount of its being emitted from a space which is practically a point.\r\nThese circumstances cause the beams of the electric light to possess\r\ngreater power of penetrating the atmosphere than those from any other\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Now superseded by the dynamo-electric machines.\r\n\r\nBut it is perhaps in the optical apparatus of lighthouses that the\r\ngreatest improvements and most admirable inventions are to be found.\r\nWhen only the blaze of an open fire furnished the guide to the mariner,\r\nthe means resorted to in order to throw across the sea the light which\r\nissued from the flames upwards or landwards, appear to have been of the\r\nrudest kind, even where such attempts were made at all. The inverted\r\ncone on the Tour de Cordouan has been already mentioned, and we read of\r\ncases in which screens of sheet brass were placed on the landward side,\r\nto throw back the light seaward.\r\n\r\nHere it may be proper to examine the conditions which determine how the\r\nlight can be made most available for the guidance of the mariner.\r\nEverybody knows that the light from a luminous body spreads out from it\r\nin all directions equally. Thus, if we simply place an electric light on\r\na tower such as that on the Bell Rock, but few of the luminous rays can\r\nbenefit the mariner: namely, those which fall upon the sea or are\r\ndirected to the horizon. A much larger portion of the light will stream\r\nupwards and be lost in space; another part will descend towards the base\r\nof the tower, and be equally wasted. Again, if the situation of our\r\nlighthouse were on the shore of the mainland, all the light which passes\r\nlandwards, whether horizontally or not, would be entirely lost for our\r\npurpose. Even if, in the case of an isolated lighthouse, we can send out\r\nall the light in a nearly level zone over the sea to the horizon, the\r\nintensity of the illumination will diminish, on account of the widening\r\nspace, as the distance increases. The question, therefore, arises\r\nwhether it is possible to send the whole of the light in one unbroken\r\nbeam, not liable to this kind of enfeeblement, so that the only loss it\r\ncan experience may be absorption by the imperfectly transparent\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere are two means of gathering up all the otherwise useless beams, and\r\nsending them in such a direction as to reach the eye of the distant\r\nmariner. The one is by reflection from mirrors, and the other by\r\nrefraction through lenses. The apparatus employed in the first process\r\nis termed _catoptric_, and in the latter _dioptric_.\r\n\r\nWhen a luminous point is placed at the focus of a parabolic mirror, all\r\nthe rays which fall upon the mirror are reflected by it in a direction\r\nparallel to its axis, so that they form a cylindrical beam. This is the\r\nmethod which was adopted in the first improvements effected in\r\nlighthouses. The parabolic reflector was first used at the Tour de\r\nCordouan in 1780, and soon afterwards metallic reflectors became the\r\nordinary appliances of lighthouses, and they are still largely used.\r\nSuch reflectors are made of sheet copper, thickly plated with silver,\r\nabout 6 oz. of this metal being applied to 16 oz. of copper. They are\r\nformed by carefully beating a circular sheet of the plated copper into a\r\nconcave shape, which is finally brought to the exact curve by the aid of\r\ngauges, and is then turned and polished. The largest of these reflectors\r\nhave a diameter of 2 ft. at the _mouth_, as it is termed, for the\r\nreflector comes forward in advance of the lamp, the chimney and burner\r\npassing through openings in the metal. The flame of the lamp occupies\r\nsuch a position that its brightest part is in the focus of the mirror;\r\nbut since the focus is a point merely, whereas the flame has a certain\r\nmagnitude, it follows that the want of coincidence of the other luminous\r\npoints with the focus produces a certain divergence in the reflected\r\nrays, so that the beam is not accurately cylindrical. This, however, is\r\nfar from being a disadvantage practically, for it has the effect of\r\nwidening a little the strip of sea illuminated by the beams. But all\r\nthat portion of the light which escapes from the mouth of the mirror\r\nwithout being reflected is radiated in the ordinary manner, and is\r\npractically lost. We shall presently see how even this light may be\r\ngathered up and brought into the main beam.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a number of such reflectors, each with its own lamp,\r\nplaced in a horizontal circle, so as to throw their beams towards\r\ndifferent points of the compass. If eight lamps were so placed, eight\r\nbeams of light would stream out across the water, like eight spokes of a\r\nwheel; eight sectors would, however, be left unilluminated, and for\r\nships in these spaces the lighthouse would be virtually non-existent:\r\nits rays could only reach vessels within the eight narrow strips\r\ntraversed by the beams. If we double the number of reflectors in the\r\ncircle, or if we arrange another series of eight in a circle above or\r\nbelow the others, so that a lamp in the second circle coincides\r\nvertically with an interval in the first, the effect will be that we\r\nshall have sixteen beams, and sixteen dark sectors, instead of eight;\r\nthat is, only a very small part of the expanse of water will receive the\r\nbenefit of the light. It must be remembered that the breadth of the\r\ncylindrical beam would not be greater than the diameter of the mirrors,\r\nand that the space illuminated by it has the same breadth at all\r\ndistances; or rather, that this is nearly the case, for the light does\r\nnot all issue precisely from the focus of the mirror. Thus, even if we\r\nuse a very great number of mirrors, we shall succeed in illuminating but\r\nan extremely small proportion of the sea horizon. This evil is met by\r\ngiving a horizontal rotatory motion to the reflectors, causing the beams\r\nto sweep over the whole expanse of the waters; and thus from every ship\r\nthe light will be visible for an instant. The rotation is produced by\r\nclockwork, duly regulated, so that an uniform motion is obtained. The\r\nregular appearances and eclipses of the light prevent the mariner from\r\nmistaking for a lighthouse a bright star near the horizon or an\r\naccidental fire on the coast; and, further, it being necessary that the\r\nlighthouses along any particular coast should be readily distinguishable\r\nfrom each other, it becomes easy, by assigning to each lighthouse a\r\ndifferent period of revolution, to individualize them, so that the\r\nmariner shall be in no danger of confounding one with another.\r\n\r\nBut when the lighthouses on a certain extent of coast are numerous, this\r\nmode of distinguishing them becomes inconvenient, as mistakes might\r\neasily be made in small differences of time; and it would be inexpedient\r\nto keep long intervals of darkness. Hence other methods have been\r\nresorted to in addition—such as red lights, or lights alternately red\r\nand white. The following are the distinctions made use of among the\r\nScottish lighthouses, including the double lighthouses, which give a\r\nleading line to the navigator:\r\n\r\n  1. Fixed lights.\r\n  2. Revolving lights.\r\n  3. Revolving, with red and white beams alternately.\r\n  4. Revolving, with alternately two white beams and one red.\r\n  5. Revolving, with alternately two red beams and one white.\r\n  6. Flashing, in which the light increases and decreases at regular\r\n    intervals.\r\n  7. Intermittent, in which, by means of a revolving screen, the light\r\n    is abruptly cut off and exhibited.\r\n  8. Double fixed lights.\r\n  9. Double revolving lights, which appear and disappear at the same\r\n    instant.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of reflectors depends on the state of polish of the\r\nsurface, and even with the most brilliant polish there is a very large\r\nloss of light: in the ordinary condition of lighthouse reflectors, it is\r\nfound that one-half of the light is lost at the surface of the mirrors.\r\nAn attempt was made in England, about the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, to substitute glass lenses for mirrors. But it was found that,\r\nin spite of the loss occurring in reflection, the mirrors produced a\r\nmore intense beam. No doubt the person who made the attempt did not\r\nobserve the true conditions of the problem. It was Fresnel, the\r\nillustrious Frenchman, whose name has already been mentioned in these\r\npages, who successfully solved the problem. He saw that it would be\r\nnecessary to give the lenses a short focal length, and at the same time\r\nto have their diameters very great. The dimensions required by these\r\nconditions far exceeded any that could be given to lenses formed in the\r\nordinary manner; and even if they could be so formed, the great\r\nthickness of glass which would be necessary would diminish the\r\ntransparency, and unduly increase the weight of the apparatus to the\r\ndetriment of the revolving apparatus. An idea now occurred to Fresnel’s\r\nmind, which, although similar to previous projects, he conceived\r\nindependently, and was undoubtedly the first to carry out. This was the\r\nidea of the _lentille à échelons_, or “lens in steps.” The construction\r\nof this will be understood from Fig. 305, where _a b_ is a section of a\r\nlens in steps, and the dotted line, _c_, shows the thickness an ordinary\r\nlens of the diameter _a b_ would have. Fresnel kept only the marginal\r\npart of such a lens; and inside of the ring formed by this, he fitted\r\nthe margin of a second large lens having the same focal distance; inside\r\nof this another ring, and so on; and in the centre a large lens of\r\nmoderate thickness. He also placed above and below the lens the\r\nconcentric prisms, _e e´_ and _f f´_, which, by refraction and total\r\nreflections (see page 399), send the rays parallel to the axis of the\r\nlens. Fresnel also contrived methods of economically grinding such\r\nlenses and prisms with precision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 305.—_Revolving Light Apparatus._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFresnel saw that it would be useless to apply lenses in lighthouse\r\nillumination unless the intensity of the light given out by the\r\nsingle-wick Argand lamps then in use could be considerably increased,\r\nwithout much enlarging the flame. Accordingly he devoted himself, in\r\nconjunction with his friend Arago, to this preliminary consideration.\r\nTheir studies and experiments led them to the construction of the lamp\r\nwith several concentric wicks—by which a brilliancy of light is\r\nobtainable twenty-five times greater than that of the single-wick\r\nArgand. The light which the improved lamp, when combined with Fresnel’s\r\nlenses, could send to the horizon, was equivalent to that which would be\r\ngiven by the united beams of 4,000 Argand lamps without optical\r\napparatus; and it was eight times greater than any which could be\r\nproduced by the reflectors then in use. The first apparatus constructed\r\non Fresnel’s plan was placed on the Tour de Cordouan in July, 1823.\r\n\r\nFrance led the van in the erection of the most perfect lighthouses in\r\nthe world, and it was not until 1835 that, by the strenuous advocacy of\r\nMr. Alan Stevenson, a dioptric apparatus was employed in a British\r\nlighthouse; but at the present time Fresnel’s principle has been adopted\r\nin the majority of British lighthouses. Fig. 305 is a part elevation,\r\nwith the section, of a catadioptric apparatus of the first class. In\r\nplan it is a regular octagon, and it sends out eight beams, which are\r\ndirected to the horizon, and made to sweep over the sea by its regular\r\nrotation, produced by clockwork contained in the case, A. The whole\r\nframe is very accurately balanced, and turns on its bearings, and the\r\nrollers, _h_, _h_, with great smoothness and steadiness. The moving\r\npower is given by the descent of a weight attached to a chain or cord,\r\nwhich is wound round a barrel. One train of wheels is connected with\r\napparatus for regulating the speed, and to this an indicator is attached\r\nwhich registers the number of revolutions made in an hour. There is also\r\na contrivance of some kind for maintaining the motion while the weight\r\nis being wound up. The reader will observe that all the light of the\r\nlamp, L, is utilized, except that which is directed towards the base and\r\ntop of the apparatus—a quantity less than one-fifth of the whole. About\r\n45 per cent. of the light emitted by the lamp falls on the refracting\r\nlenses; 22½ on the upper reflecting prisms; and 13½ on the lower\r\nreflecting prisms. The brightest part of the flame is placed so that the\r\nbeams from it are directed towards the sea horizon, and the space\r\nbetween the horizon and the neighbourhood of the lighthouse receives\r\nample light from the other parts of the flame. Thus a ship, or any part\r\nof the sea within the range of the lighthouse, will see the light\r\nappearing at regular intervals, as one after another of the eight beams\r\npasses across it, the intervals being one eighth of the time in which\r\nthe apparatus completes its revolution. The zones of totally reflecting\r\nprisms, shown at _e e´_, _f f´_, Fig. 305, were not adopted in British\r\nlighthouses until 1844, when the Skerryvore light was exhibited with the\r\ncomplete apparatus represented in the drawing.\r\n\r\nThe optical apparatus for lighthouses is constructed of certain sizes,\r\nadapted to the different situations in which it is to be used. The\r\napparatus we have just described is made in six forms, according to the\r\n_order_ of light required. The first three orders are for sea lights,\r\nthe rest for harbour lights; and the following are the dimensions of the\r\napparatus for each order of revolving or fixed lights:\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬───────────────────────────┐\r\n │   Order.    │  Height in  │  Internal   │   Number of Reflecting    │\r\n │             │   Inches.   │ Diameter in │          Prisms.          │\r\n │             │             │   Inches.   │                           │\r\n ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┤\r\n │             │             │             │  In Upper   │  In Lower   │\r\n │             │             │             │    Zone.    │    Zone.    │\r\n ├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤\r\n │      1      │         106½│          72½│     18      │      8      │\r\n │      2      │          83½│          55 │     16      │      4      │\r\n │      3      │          61½│          39½│     11      │      4      │\r\n │      4      │          29 │          19¾│      5      │      4      │\r\n │      5      │          21¾│          14¾│      5      │      4      │\r\n │      6      │          17½│          12 │      5      │      4      │\r\n └─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘\r\n\r\nWhen a revolving apparatus of the above description is erected on shore,\r\na reflector of suitable shape and dimensions is placed on the landward\r\nside of the lamp, so as to throw its rays back upon itself and towards\r\nthe lenses which are directed seaward.\r\n\r\nFresnel also constructed glass apparatus for fixed lights. If we require\r\nto send the light equally towards the horizon in all directions at once,\r\nthe problem is capable of solution, either by a proper form of glass\r\napparatus or by a proper form of mirrors. Suppose the section, _e c f_,\r\nFig. 305, to revolve about a vertical axis passing through the lamp, it\r\nwould sweep out a form which, when executed in glass, would spread out\r\nall the light falling upon it into one horizontal sheet. Fresnel was\r\nobliged to content himself with an approximation to this shape, formed\r\nby a prismatic frame of many sides, containing straight horizontal bars\r\nof glass, having the section _e c f_. The light is not quite uniformly\r\ndistributed by such apparatus, but the difficulty and expense attending\r\nthe formation of prismatic rings were very great when Fresnel\r\nconstructed this apparatus. Such rings can now be produced economically\r\nand accurately, and therefore the fixed-light apparatus is now\r\nconstructed of circular glass rings, mounted in sections in such a\r\nmanner that a vertical section through the axis of the apparatus would\r\ncut them in the form represented at _e c f_. Instead of forming the\r\nmetal framework in which the glass is mounted with vertical ribs, it is\r\nmade with the ribs placed somewhat diagonally, in order that the dark\r\nsectors which would be produced by the shadows of upright ribs may be\r\navoided. It should be understood that the forms of the glass in each\r\nside of the octagonal apparatus represented in the figure are produced\r\nby the revolution of the same section, _e c f_, about the horizontal\r\naxis, _d g_.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious promoter of the catoptric system has contrived to solve the\r\nsame problem by mirrors. The form of these may be understood by the aid\r\nof Fig. 306, which, however, relates to another contrivance. Suppose\r\nthat the lines A B, A´ B´, are turned about C D as an axis, all three\r\npreserving their relative positions, A B and A´ B´ would sweep out two\r\nparabolic cones, which would have the property of reflecting in a\r\nhorizontal direction all rays falling upon them from a lamp placed at L.\r\nBut glass, as a material for lighthouse apparatus, has so many\r\nadvantages over metal that it is probable that metallic reflectors will\r\nsoon be entirely obsolete. The polish of the metal is very readily\r\ndestroyed, and as it is constantly liable to be tarnished, the frequent\r\ncleaning required is apt to produce a scratched state of the surface,\r\neven when great care is used. Far greater accuracy of form can be\r\nimparted to glass than to metal reflectors. And then there is the great\r\nloss of light occurring at even the most highly polished surfaces of\r\nmetal: a loss which is far greater than that occasioned by the\r\nrefraction and reflections of the glass apparatus. There are cases,\r\nhowever, in which it is desirable to throw the whole of the light into\r\none beam, and this cannot be done without reflecting the light from one\r\nside. Mr. Alan Stevenson contrived an excellent apparatus for this\r\npurpose, and the diagram, Fig. 306, will explain its nature. L is a\r\npoint representing the source of light, A B, B´ A´, a parabolic metallic\r\nmirror. All the rays between L A and L B, and all between L A´ and L\r\nB´—that is, all those which fall upon the mirror—will be reflected\r\nparallel to L G; but those between L B and L B´ would escape from the\r\nmouth of the mirror, B B´, as a diverging cone. This is prevented by\r\nplacing the lens, H I, the focus of which is at L, so as to convert the\r\ndiverging cone, I L H, into the cylindrical beam, E H I F; and thus half\r\nthe light emitted from the luminous point is sent in one direction. A\r\nhemispherical reflector, C K D, of which L is the centre, receives the\r\nother half, which is thus thrown back through L, and then follows the\r\nsame course as the direct rays. For the metallic reflector, C K D, Mr.\r\nStevenson afterwards substituted a system of glass zones; of which O P Q\r\nrepresents the sections. These had the same effect as the metallic\r\nreflectors, without the loss of light occasioned by the latter. The\r\ninner surface of the glass, C K D, is hemispherical, and the prismatic\r\nzones are such as would be produced by turning the section about L K (or\r\nC D) as an axis. The dotted lines show the course of a ray of light, L\r\n_m_, which, meeting the hemispherical surface perpendicularly, passes\r\nstraight through it, and is totally reflected at _m_ by the inclined\r\nsurface, and again at _n_, so that it returns to L by the path _n_ L.\r\nReflecting glass prisms were also substituted for the metallic mirror, A\r\nB, B´ A´, and thus the use of metal has been entirely dispensed with in\r\nthis apparatus. This light has been termed by Mr. Stevenson the\r\n_holophotal_ (ὁλο, _entire_, φως, _light_). Such an apparatus will form\r\nthe intensest beam that a given source of illumination can yield. On the\r\nother hand, when a fixed light is distributed to the whole horizon\r\nsimultaneously, the illuminating power of the source is taxed to the\r\nutmost. These two cases may be considered the extreme modes of disposing\r\nof the light, while the parcelling of it into several beams, as effected\r\nby the apparatus represented in Fig. 305, is an intermediate mode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 306.—_Stevenson’s Holophotal Light._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to mention that the holophotal light at Baccalieu,\r\nin Newfoundland, is visible in clear weather from another point 40 miles\r\ndistant. So long a range as this is seldom possible at sea, on account\r\nof the rounded form of the earth rendering it necessary to raise the\r\nlight nearly 1,000 ft. above the water, if it is required to be visible\r\nat 40 miles’ distance. A shorter distance generally suffices for the\r\nrequirements of the navigator; and therefore lighthouse towers rising\r\nfrom the water are seldom carried to a greater height than something\r\nbetween 100 ft. and 150 ft. A light elevated 100 ft. above the water\r\nwould be seen from the deck of a vessel 14 miles distant, and from the\r\nmasthead a much greater distance.\r\n\r\nThe optical apparatus of a lighthouse is protected by an outer metal\r\nframework glazed with thick plate glass. This framework is made of iron,\r\nor of gun-metal—the latter being preferred on account of the frequent\r\npainting which iron needs in order to preserve it from corrosion. The\r\nglass is carefully fitted into the framework, so as to avoid exposure to\r\nstrains from the shocks and vibrations to which a lighthouse is exposed.\r\nThe keepers are always provided with a store of panes of glass, ready\r\nfor fitting into their places in case of accidents. Sometimes the glass\r\nis broken by large sea-birds dashing against it, and by pebbles which\r\nare thrown up by the waves, or driven by the wind against the panes. It\r\nis the interior of this lantern which forms the light-room already\r\nspoken of. Great pains have been bestowed on the proper ventilation of\r\nthese light-rooms, as not only must the air have access to the lamp to\r\nsupply the flame, but the carbonic acid which escapes from the chimney\r\nof the lamp must be promptly removed. Another serious inconvenience of\r\nan ill-ventilated light-room would be the condensation, in the inner\r\nsurface of the plate glass, of the aqueous vapour, which is also a\r\nproduct of the combustion.\r\n\r\nThe lenses and circular prisms for lighthouses are usually made of crown\r\nglass, and are ground by fixing them on a large revolving iron table, on\r\nwhich they are bedded in plaster of Paris and cemented by pitch—great\r\ncare being taken to place them in the exact position required, for only\r\nabout one-eighth of an inch is allowed for grinding down to shape the\r\nglass as it comes from the moulds. Sand, emery, and finally rouge, are\r\nused with water for the grinding and polishing processes. The cost of\r\nthe optical apparatus alone of a light of the first order, like that\r\nshown in Fig. 305, amounts to upwards of £1,500. The lenses and prisms\r\nare very carefully adjusted in their framework after this has been\r\nfixed, and no plan of testing the adjustment has been found more\r\nefficient than that of viewing the sea horizon through them from the\r\nposition which the flame will occupy.\r\n\r\nThe men to whom the charge of a lighthouse is confided undertake a duty\r\ninvolving the gravest responsibilities, and demanding unremitting care.\r\nIn those lighthouses where a number of reflectors are hung upon a\r\nrevolving frame, the extinction of one lamp may not be a matter of much\r\nconsequence; but where only one lamp is used, life and death depend upon\r\nits burning. To isolated lighthouses—such as those of Skerryvore and the\r\nBell Rock—four keepers are appointed, and one of these is always on\r\nshore on leave, so that the men may be relieved at intervals; for it has\r\nbeen found that a residence in these lonely towers cannot be continued\r\nlong together without bad effects. The duties of the lighthouse-keepers\r\nmust be performed with the greatest regularity. The glasses of the\r\nlight-room and the optical apparatus are carefully cleaned every\r\nmorning; the lamps are supplied with oil, the wicks trimmed or renewed,\r\nthe machinery oiled and adjusted, and everything prepared in readiness\r\nfor the evening. At sunset the lamps are lighted, and one keeper takes\r\nhis watch until midnight, when he is relieved by another, who maintains\r\nthe vigil till sunrise, when the lamps are extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of the regulation appointing three men to be always at\r\nthe lighthouse may be illustrated by an incident which occurred about\r\nthe beginning of the present century at the lighthouse on the “Smalls,”\r\na rock in the Bristol Channel. Two keepers held watch over the light on\r\nthat rock, which for months together is sometimes cut off from all\r\ncommunication with the shore. At the time alluded to, after the weather\r\nhad for two weeks prevented access to the lighthouse, it was rumoured\r\namong the seafaring men of the neighbouring ports that something was\r\nwrong at the “Smalls,” for a signal of distress had been observed; but\r\nthe boats could not go within speaking distance, although many attempts\r\nwere made to reach the rock. The relatives of the men became anxious,\r\nand night after night watched for the light. But the light never failed\r\nto appear at the proper hour. After four months came calmer weather, and\r\nthen a boat brought to shore one lightkeeper alive, the other dead. What\r\nthe former felt when he found his comrade to be dying in their dreadful\r\nisolation, or what his emotions were when he found himself there alone\r\nwith the lifeless body, is not recorded. But the thought occurred to him\r\nthat he must not commit the body to the waves, lest any suspicion of\r\nfoul play might fall upon himself. He therefore contrived a sort of\r\ncoffin for the dead man, and dragging it up to the gallery of the\r\nlighthouse, tied it there. Punctually and faithfully for four long\r\nmonths did he perform all the duties of his position, keeping watch from\r\ntwilight till dawn in that lonely light-room, while his ghastly charge\r\nremained there within sight. But he came on shore strangely altered—a\r\nsad, silent, gloomy, worn man—so that even his intimate friends hardly\r\nknew him.\r\n\r\nHere we close this brief account of the modern lighthouse, and of its\r\nbeautiful appliances, by which Science “has given new securities to the\r\nmariner,” in addition to those with which she furnished him when she\r\nshowed him the use of the compass, supplied him with the chronometer,\r\nand placed the sextant in his hands. How anxiously must the seaman who\r\nhas been prevented by unfavourable skies from ascertaining his exact\r\nposition, and has been trusting to the log and the compass to work his\r\nreckoning, scan the horizon for the first glimpse of the hospitable\r\nlight beacon, which seems to say that the country he is approaching has\r\nbeen watching for his coming, and welcomes him to its shores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 307.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other of our nineteenth century inventions is at once so beautiful,\r\nso precious, so popular, so appreciated as photography. It is exercising\r\na beneficial influence over the social sentiments, the arts, the\r\nsciences of the whole world—an influence not the less real because it is\r\nwide-spread and unobtrusive. The new art cherishes domestic and friendly\r\nfeelings by its ever-present transcripts of the familiar faces, keeping\r\nfresh the memory of the distant and the dead; it keeps alive our\r\nadmiration of the great and the good by presenting us with the\r\nlineaments of the heroes, the saints, the sages of all lands. It\r\ngratifies, by faithful portrayals of scenes of grandeur and beauty, the\r\neyes of him who has neither wealth nor leisure for travel. It has\r\nimproved pictorial art by sending the painter to the truths of nature;\r\nit has reproduced his works with marvellous fidelity; it has set before\r\nthe multitude the finest works of the sculptor. It is lending invaluable\r\naid to almost every science. The astronomer now derives his mathematical\r\ndata from the photograph; by its aid the architect superintends the\r\nerection of distant buildings, the engineer watches over the progress of\r\nhis designs in remote lands, the medical man amasses records of morbid\r\nanatomy, the geologist studies the anatomy of the earth, the ethnologist\r\nobtains faithful transcripts of the features of every race. To the mind\r\nof an intelligent reader numberless instances will present themselves,\r\nnot only of the utility of photography in the narrower sense of the\r\nterm, but of its higher utility in ministering to our love of the\r\nbeautiful in art and in nature.\r\n\r\nEffects produced by chemical changes to which the rays of the sun give\r\nrise are matters of common observation. The fading of the colour in the\r\nportions of a fabric which are exposed to the light is a familiar\r\ninstance; and the bleaching of linen under the influence of sunshine in\r\nthe presence of moisture is a well-known operation. Decompositions\r\nproduced by light in certain compounds of silver soon attracted the\r\nattention of chemists, and the remarkable activity of the solar rays in\r\ncausing the combination of hydrogen and chlorine gases has been even\r\nmade the means of measuring the intensity of light. When equal volumes\r\nof these two gases are mixed together in the dark, they may be kept for\r\nan indefinite period without change, provided only that the mixture be\r\npreserved from access of light. But the instant it is exposed to the\r\ndirect rays of the sun, or to an intense light, such as that of burning\r\nmagnesium, the two gases suddenly unite with a loud explosion, in which\r\nthe glass vessel containing them is shattered into atoms. The product is\r\nan intensely acid invisible gas, called hydrochloric acid; and if the\r\nmixture is exposed to the diffused light of day, instead of the direct\r\nrays of the sun, then the production of hydrochloric acid will take\r\nplace gradually, and with a rapidity depending on the intensity of the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nOf vastly more importance than the small operations of the laboratory\r\nand the bleach-field are the changes which the sun’s rays silently and\r\nunobtrusively effect in the vegetable world. The chemical effect of\r\nlight here appears to reside in its power of separating oxygen from\r\nsubstances with which it is combined. The green parts of plants absorb\r\nfrom the atmosphere the carbonic acid gas, which is constantly produced\r\nby the respiration of men and animals, and by combustion, and other\r\nprocesses. Under the influence of sunshine, this carbonic acid is\r\ndecomposed within the tissues of the plant; the oxygen is restored to\r\nthe atmosphere; the carbon with which it was united is retained to build\r\nup the structure of the plant. In a similar manner light separates the\r\noxygen from the hydrogen of water, and the former gas is given off by\r\nthe leaves, while the hydrogen enters into the composition of the plant.\r\nThe carbon, which forms so large an element in the food of plants, is\r\nchiefly obtained in this way; and the abundance of the supply of oxygen\r\nthus thrown into the atmosphere may be inferred from the fact that a\r\nsingle leaf of the water-lily will in the course of one summer give off\r\nnearly eleven cubic feet of oxygen. But for this continual restoration\r\nof oxygen to the atmosphere, animal life would soon disappear from the\r\nface of the earth. It is the office of the vegetable world not only to\r\nfurnish a supply of organic matter as food for animals, but when the\r\nmaterials of that food have been converted into oxidized products in the\r\nanimal system, and returned to the atmosphere as carbonic acid and\r\naqueous vapour, the sunshine, acting on the vegetable structure (chiefly\r\non the delicate tissue of the leaf), tears apart the oxygen and the\r\nother substance. These are, therefore, once more capable of combination,\r\nby which they may again supply the animal with heat and the other\r\nenergies of life.\r\n\r\nThose actions of light which have been last referred to are called by\r\nthe chemist _reducing actions_, a term which he applies to the cases in\r\nwhich a compound is made to part with its oxygen or other similar\r\nelement: when the remaining ingredient is a metal, the operation by\r\nwhich the other has been removed is always called _reduction_. On the\r\nother hand, the inverse operations by which oxygen, chlorine, &c., are\r\nfixed upon other bodies, are distinguished as processes of _oxidation_.\r\nLight is the means of determining each of these kinds of changes,\r\naccording to the conditions and the nature of the substances exposed to\r\nits action. Thus moist chloride of silver will retain its white colour\r\nif preserved in the dark; but if exposed to sunlight, it quickly\r\nacquires a violet tint, which deepens in intensity until it has become\r\nblack. The dark matter was formerly admitted to be silver; for it was\r\nknown that the finely divided metal has this appearance, that during the\r\nprocess the compound gives off chlorine, and that when nitric acid is\r\npoured upon the darkened matter, reddish fumes are given off, exactly as\r\nwhen the acid acts upon pure silver. The use of silver nitrate as a\r\nmarking-ink for linen depends upon a similar alteration of the salt\r\nwithin the fibres; and the same reduction takes place when to a solution\r\nof the nitrate in water organic matter is added. If a piece of white\r\nsilk be dipped into a solution of chloride of gold, and exposed to the\r\nsun’s rays while still wet, the silk becomes first green, then purple,\r\nand finally a film of metallic gold will be found overspreading its\r\nsurface. Many other chlorides and analogous compounds are similarly\r\naffected by sunlight. On the other hand, chlorides, as we have already\r\nseen, and oxygen, fix on hydrogen and on organic substances with greater\r\nenergy under the influence of light. A large series of chemical\r\ncompounds are obtained by means of the augmented affinity of chlorine\r\nfor hydrogen induced by the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt was in availing himself of an action of the latter class that, in\r\n1813, Joseph Nicéphore Niepce[11] established photography; for he was\r\nthe first to obtain a permanent sun-picture. Twelve years before this,\r\nWedgwood and Davy had copied paintings made on glass, and the profiles\r\nof objects, the shadows of which were projected upon a piece of white\r\npaper, or white leather, saturated with a solution of nitrate of silver.\r\nThe images so obtained could not be fixed, as no means was then known of\r\nremoving the silver salts which had not been acted upon during the\r\nexposure; and the pictures soon blackened in every part when exposed to\r\nthe light. The application of the _camera obscura_, and the fixing of\r\nthe image so obtained, define the commencement of the art of\r\nphotography. The process of Niepce, which was termed _heliography_, was\r\nconducted by smearing a highly polished metallic plate with a certain\r\nresinous substance known as “bitumen of Judæa,” and this was exposed to\r\nthe image formed in the camera for some hours. The action of the light\r\nwas such, that the resin, which before exposure was soluble in oil of\r\nlavender, became insoluble in that substance. Hence, on treating the\r\nplate after exposure with that solvent, only the deep shadows dissolved\r\naway, the lights being represented by the undissolved resin. The\r\nbrightly polished parts of the plate, which were uncovered by the\r\nremoval of the resin, appeared dark when made to reflect dark objects,\r\nwhile the resin remaining unchanged on the plate appeared light in\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Born at Chalon-sur-Saône, died 1833.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 a French artist, named Daguerre,[12] who had already made some\r\nreputation as a painter of dioramas, entered into a sort of partnership\r\nwith Niepce, into whose process he introduced some improvements; but,\r\ndissatisfied with the slowness of this proceeding, he invented a process\r\nof his own, by which pictures of great beauty could be produced with all\r\nthe shadows, lights, and half-tints faithfully rendered; while the time\r\nof exposure in the camera was reduced to twenty minutes. In this process\r\nthe burnished surface of silver formed the shadows. A plate of copper,\r\ncoated with pure silver, had the silvered surface polished to the\r\nhighest degree, and it was then exposed to the vapour of iodine until a\r\nthin yellow film had been produced uniformly over the silver. It was\r\nthen placed in the camera; and, although when withdrawn no image was\r\nperceptible, a latent image was nevertheless present; for when the plate\r\nwas exposed to the vapour of mercury, that substance attached itself to\r\nthe parts of the plate in proportion as they had been acted upon by the\r\nlight. Means were adopted by Daguerre for fixing the picture; and after\r\nhis processes had been made public in 1839, several important\r\nimprovements were proposed by other persons. By using bromine as well as\r\niodine the sensitiveness of the plates was so much increased that the\r\ntime required for exposure was reduced to two minutes, so that about the\r\nyear 1841 portraits began to be taken by this process.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  L. J. M. Daguerre, born 1787, died 1851.\r\n\r\nThe world at large, which profits most by great inventions, has little\r\nidea at what cost of intense application, concentrated thought, and\r\nheroic perseverance, such discoveries are made. What his discovery must\r\nhave cost Daguerre may be inferred from an anecdote related by J.\r\nBaptiste Dumas, the distinguished French chemist and statesman. At the\r\nclose of one of his popular lectures in 1825–-_fourteen years before\r\nDaguerre had perfected his process_—a lady came up to him and said,\r\n“Monsieur Dumas, I have to ask you a question of vital importance to\r\nmyself. I am the wife of Daguerre, the painter. He has for some time let\r\nthe idea possess his mind that he can fix the images of the camera. Do\r\nyou, as a man of science, think it can ever be done, or is my husband\r\nmad?” “In the present state of our knowledge we are unable to do it,”\r\nreplied Dumas; “but I cannot say it will always remain impossible, or\r\nset down as mad the man who seeks to do it.” The French Government, with\r\nan honourable recognition of the merits of Daguerre, and of Niepce who\r\nhad passed away poor and almost unknown, awarded to the former a pension\r\nof 6,000 francs (£240), and to Isidore Niepce, the son of the latter, a\r\npension of 4,000 francs, one-half to be continued to their widows.\r\n\r\nBut Daguerre’s process had no sooner been brought to perfection than it\r\nbegan to be supplanted by a rival method, devised by an Englishman, Mr.\r\nFox Talbot, who had published his process six months before that of\r\nDaguerre was given to the world, and who, therefore, was unacquainted\r\nwith the details of the latter. The first of Mr. Talbot’s publications\r\ncontained only an improved mode of preparing a sensitive paper for\r\ncopying prints, by applying them to it and causing the light to pass\r\nthrough the paper of the print, so that the parts of the sensitive paper\r\nprotected by the opaque black lines were not acted upon by the light.\r\nThe paper was first dipped in a solution of chloride of sodium, and then\r\nin one of nitrate of silver, the result being the formation in the pores\r\nof the paper of chloride of silver, a substance much more quickly\r\naffected by light than the nitrate of silver used by Davy and Wedgwood.\r\nThe impression so obtained was a _negative_, that is, the lights and\r\nshades of the original were reversed; but when this negative was again\r\ncopied by the same process, it produced a perfect copy of the original\r\nprint, for the lights and shades were of course reversed from those in\r\nthe negative proof. Thus from one negative any number of positive or\r\nnatural copies could be produced; and this point in Mr. Talbot’s\r\ninvention is one great feature of photography as now practised. In 1841,\r\nMr. Talbot obtained a patent for a process he called the _Calotype_, but\r\nwhich, in his honour, has since been known as the Talbotype. A sheet of\r\npaper is soaked, first in a solution of nitrate of silver, and then in\r\none of iodide of potassium, by which it becomes covered with iodide of\r\nsilver; it may then be dried. It is prepared for the camera by brushing\r\nit over with a solution of gallic acid containing a little nitrate of\r\nsilver. By this last process its sensitiveness is greatly increased, and\r\nan exposure in the camera for a few seconds, or minutes, according to\r\nthe power of the light, suffices to impress the paper with a latent or\r\ninvisible image, which reveals itself when the paper is treated with a\r\nfresh portion of the gallic acid mixture. The Talbotype is the\r\nfoundation of the methods of photography now in general use; but, before\r\nwe describe these, it may be proper to mention some other substances\r\nwhich have been found sensitive to light, and to discuss the nature of\r\nthe invisible images which are first produced in these processes.\r\n\r\nThe _art_ of photography has outstripped the _science_—in other words,\r\nthe nature and laws of the chemical actions by which its beautiful\r\neffects are produced are not yet clearly understood, and some quite\r\nrecent discoveries seem to show that we have yet much to learn before a\r\ncomplete theory of the chemical action of light can be proposed. Some\r\nresults which have been established may be mentioned, as they show those\r\ncurious effects of light to be more general than would be supposed from\r\na description of photographic processes dependent on silver salts only.\r\nIt has been found that certain acids, certain salts, and certain\r\ncompounds containing only two elements—of which one is a metal—have a\r\ntendency to split up, or resolve themselves into their several\r\nconstituents, when exposed to the action of light. On the other hand,\r\nchlorine, bromine, and iodine exhibit, under the same conditions, an\r\nexalted affinity for the hydrogen of organic matters. These tendencies\r\nconcur when the compounds above referred to are associated with organic\r\nmaterials, as in photography. Solution of nitrate of silver is blackened\r\nwhen it is exposed to light on a piece of paper which has been dipped\r\ninto the solution; but a piece of white unglazed porcelain similarly\r\ntreated shows no change. A solution of nitrate of uranium in pure water\r\nis not changed by light; but a solution of the same salt in alcohol\r\nbecomes green, and deposits oxide of uranium. The reducing action of the\r\nlight is insufficient of itself to accomplish the decomposition of the\r\nsalt in the first case; but the presence of the organic matter\r\ndetermines this decomposition in the second case. Bichromate of\r\npotassium is by itself not easily decomposed by light; but when it is\r\nmixed with sugar, starch, gum, or gelatine, the sunbeams readily reduce\r\nit. It is remarkable that the gelatine, gum, or starch becomes insoluble\r\nby thus taking up oxygen, and the gelatine loses its property of\r\nswelling up in water. We shall presently see the advantages which have\r\nbeen drawn from these circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the light should act upon both the organic\r\nsubstance and the oxidizing substance at the same time. If paper\r\nimpregnated with iodide of silver and gallic acid be placed in the\r\ncamera, the image soon appears; but if, as in the Talbotype, the iodide\r\nof silver only be acted upon by the light, no image is perceptible on\r\nwithdrawing the paper from the camera. The action of the light has\r\nnevertheless imparted to the silver salt a tendency to reduction; for\r\nwhen the paper is afterwards dipped into a solution of gallic acid, the\r\nimage immediately appears. In order to distinguish these two actions,\r\nthe substance which receives and preserves the latent impression from\r\nthe light is called the _sensitive_ substance, and that which reveals\r\nthe latent image is termed the _developing_ substance. A considerable\r\nnumber of substances having this relation to each other have been\r\nobserved, and the following table of instances—cited by Niepce de\r\nSaint-Victor, the nephew of the original inventor—will give some idea of\r\ntheir variety:\r\n\r\n ┌───────────────────┬────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐\r\n │     Sensitive     │ Developing Substance.  │        Results.        │\r\n │ Substances in the │                        │                        │\r\n │ paper exposed to  │                        │                        │\r\n │ the action of the │                        │                        │\r\n │      Light.       │                        │                        │\r\n ├───────────────────┼────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┤\r\n │None, _i.e._, plain│A salt of silver        │Black image.            │\r\n │  paper.           │                        │                        │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │Nitrate of silver, │Gallic acid, or sulphate│Black image.            │\r\n │  or iodide of     │  of iron.              │                        │\r\n │  silver.          │                        │                        │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │                   │{ Water                 │By prolonged action of  │\r\n │                   │                        │  light, a grey image of│\r\n │                   │                        │  protoxide of uranium; │\r\n │                   │                        │  the image disappears  │\r\n │                   │                        │  when paper is kept in │\r\n │                   │                        │  the dark, but shows   │\r\n │                   │                        │  itself again in the   │\r\n │                   │                        │  light.                │\r\n │Nitrate of uranium.│{                       │                        │\r\n │                   │{ Red prussiate of      │Intensely red positive  │\r\n │                   │  potash                │  image; becomes blue by│\r\n │                   │                        │  sulphate of iron.     │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │Nitrate of uranium │Nitrate of silver or    │Unchangeable            │\r\n │  and tartaric     │  chloride of gold.     │  images—resembling     │\r\n │  acid.            │                        │  those of ordinary     │\r\n │                   │                        │  photographs.          │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │Chloride of gold.  │Nitrate of uranium,     │. . . . . .             │\r\n │                   │  sulphate of iron,     │                        │\r\n │                   │  sulphate of copper,   │                        │\r\n │                   │  bichloride of mercury,│                        │\r\n │                   │  salt of tin.          │                        │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │                   │{ Sulphate of iron      │Blue-black image.       │\r\n │Gallic acid.       │{                       │                        │\r\n │                   │{ Red prussiate of      │Blue image.             │\r\n │                   │  potash                │                        │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │Red prussiate of   │Water, bichloride of    │Blue image, hastened by │\r\n │  potash.          │  mercury, gallic acid, │  acids and by heat.    │\r\n │                   │  salt of silver, salt  │                        │\r\n │                   │  of cobalt.            │                        │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │Bichloride of      │Protochloride of tin,   │. . . . . .             │\r\n │  mercury.         │  soda, potash, sulphide│                        │\r\n │                   │  of sodium.            │                        │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │Chromic acid, or   │Salts of silver         │Purple-red positive     │\r\n │  bichromate of    │                        │  image.                │\r\n │  potash.          │                        │                        │\r\n │                   │                        │                        │\r\n │                   │{ Blue litmus           │Red image.              │\r\n │Starch.            │{ Iodide of potassium   │Reddish brown image.    │\r\n │                   │{ White indigo          │Blue positive image.    │\r\n │                   │{ Campeachy wood        │Red positive image.     │\r\n └───────────────────┴────────────────────────┴────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the instances in which actions of this kind have\r\nbeen observed. It is remarkable that the order of the first two columns\r\nin this table may be inverted without changing the result. Thus, instead\r\nof exposing iodide of silver to the light and developing the image with\r\ngallic acid, one may expose a paper saturated with gallic acid solution,\r\nand develop with iodide of potassium and nitrate of silver. The first\r\nreaction noted in the table deserves some remark: it is not peculiar to\r\npaper, but is common to most organic materials, such as albumen,\r\ncollodion starch, fabrics, and indeed to organic matters in general,\r\nprovided they are not of a black colour. Tartaric acid, sulphate of\r\nquinine, and nitrate of uranium increase this sensibility. The paper\r\nwhich has been impressed preserves its undeveloped image for a prolonged\r\nperiod if kept in darkness; and it has been found that one piece of\r\npaper can impart the image to another by simple contact in the dark.\r\nWhat is still more remarkable, the invisible impressions on a piece of\r\npaper may be transferred to another not in contact by merely placing it\r\nopposite the first, and separated by an interval of a quarter of an\r\ninch. No satisfactory explanation of these phenomena has been advanced,\r\nbut many conjectures have been made. One of these supposes that some\r\nunknown intermediate products are formed, which are, in the case of the\r\nlatent image on paper, very oxidizable; but in the case of silver salts,\r\n&c., very reducible, so that the addition of a silver salt in the first\r\ncase, and of organic matter in the second, only completes the phenomena\r\nby ordinary chemical action. Niepce de Saint-Victor, however, found that\r\na surface of freshly broken porcelain alone will receive a latent\r\nimpression from light, and will reduce in those places sensitive salts\r\nof silver. He believes that the light in these latent images is simply\r\nstored up, and that its energy remains fixed to the surfaces until the\r\noccasion of its producing a chemical action.\r\n\r\nWhen a pure solar spectrum is made to fall upon paper rendered sensitive\r\nby silver salts, the effect is observed to be greatest near the\r\nFraunhofer line H (No. 1, Plate XVII.), and it is prolonged with\r\ndecreasing intensity beyond the violet end of the spectrum, while\r\ntowards the other end it terminates about the line F. When other\r\nsensitive substances are used, the range of photographic power in the\r\nspectrum is modified. It has been found that when a daguerrotype plate\r\nwhich has been impressed by the light in the camera is afterwards\r\nexposed to the red or yellow rays of the spectrum, it loses its property\r\nof condensing the mercurial vapours. This destruction of photographic\r\nimpression by red or yellow light has a practical application of great\r\nimportance, for it permits the processes of preparing paper and plates\r\nto be carried on in a laboratory lighted by windows having yellow or\r\nred, instead of the ordinary colourless, glass. Thus we see that it is\r\nby no means the whole of the solar rays which are concerned in producing\r\nphotographic images; nay, there are some which even tend to destroy the\r\nimpressions produced by others. The fact that it is not the light, but\r\nonly certain rays in the sunbeam, may be proved very conclusively by an\r\nexperiment with a glass bulb filled with a mixture of equal volumes of\r\nhydrogen and chlorine gases. When such a bulb is exposed to the light of\r\nthe sun or of burning magnesium, which is made to reach it by passing\r\nthrough a piece of _red_ glass, no explosion takes place; but if the\r\nbulb be covered only with a piece of _blue_ or _violet_ glass, the\r\nexplosion is produced just as quickly as if it were exposed to the\r\nunaltered rays.\r\n\r\nThe visible spectrum obtained in the experiment described on page 318 is\r\nfar from constituting the only radiations which reach us from the sun.\r\nFor invisible beams of heat, less refrangible than the red rays, are\r\nfound beyond the red end of the spectrum; and another invisible spectrum\r\nstretches far beyond the violet end, formed of rays recognized only by\r\ntheir chemical activity. It is these which effect photographic actions,\r\nand though they are in part more highly refrangible than any of the rays\r\nproducing the visible spectrum, a large portion are refracted within its\r\nlimits, so that the maximum of photographic action in a spectrum is\r\nusually near the violet end. When we wish to examine the spectrum of the\r\nheat rays, it is necessary to replace the glass prism by one made of\r\nrock salt, for glass absorbs these heat rays. It also intercepts a great\r\npart of the most refrangible rays; for when a prism of _quartz_ is\r\nsubstituted for the glass one, the spectrum becomes greatly extended at\r\nthe violet end. The dark Fraunhofer lines which cross the visible\r\nspectrum are represented also in great numbers in the invisible\r\nspectrum: in photographs of the _ultra-violet_ rays more than 700 dark\r\nlines have been counted. It has been proposed to employ quartz lenses in\r\nthe photographic camera; but there is reason to believe that the\r\nincreased transparency of such lenses for the chemical rays would be\r\ncounterbalanced by certain disadvantages attending the use of quartz.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the images which are formed in the camera obscura long ago\r\ngave rise to the desire of fixing them permanently. We know how\r\nperfectly photography has already satisfied that desire, so far as the\r\n_forms_ are concerned. The very perfection of the results obtained in\r\nthis direction increases our regret at our inability to fix also the\r\ncolours, and secure the picture, not in grey or brown tones of reduced\r\nsilver, but with all the glowing hues of nature. An observation made by\r\nHerschel, Davy, and others, seemed at one time to hold out hopes of a\r\npossible realization of chromatic photographs. It was noticed that the\r\nimages developed upon chloride of silver, of the different parts of the\r\nsolar spectrum, partook somewhat of the colours of the rays which\r\nproduced them. Edmond Becquerel made a plate of polished silver, placed\r\nin dilute hydrochloric acid, form the positive pole of a battery. The\r\nplate thus became coated with an extremely thin layer of chloride of\r\nsilver, which, as its thickness augmented, exhibited the series of\r\ncolours due to the action of light on thin films. The operation was\r\nstopped when the plate had become of a violet colour for the second\r\ntime; it was then washed, dried, polished with the finest tripoli, and\r\nheated to 212° F., the whole of these operations having been carried on\r\nin the dark. When this plate was exposed for about two hours to the\r\nsolar spectrum, fixed by proper appliances which counteracted the\r\napparent motion of the sun, the luminous rays were found to have\r\nimpressed the plate with their respective colours. The yellow was\r\nsomewhat pale, but the red, green, and violet were exhibited in their\r\ntrue tints. A theoretical explanation has been advanced, which supposes\r\nthat yellow light, for example, renders the surface of the plate on\r\nwhich it falls peculiarly capable of receiving and transmitting\r\nvibrations corresponding to those of yellow light. Just as a stretched\r\ncord responds to its own musical note, the modified plate gives back,\r\nout of all the vibrations which fall upon it in ordinary light, only\r\nthose of which it has itself acquired the periodicity. But since the\r\nplate has not lost its sensitiveness to take on other rates of\r\nvibrations, it receives other impressions, which first weaken and then\r\novercome the former, and, therefore, the colour necessarily vanishes.\r\nThis kind of difficulty seems to be a necessary concomitant of every\r\nattempt in this direction; and all the hopes founded on results yet\r\nobtained have been disappointed by the rapid fading of the images.\r\n\r\nThe comparative cheapness and convenience of Talbot’s process, and\r\nespecially the facilities which it afforded for the multiplication of\r\nproofs, gave an immense impulse to photographic art. But the irregular\r\nand fibrous structure of paper prevented the attainment of the beautiful\r\nsharpness of outline and clear definition of detail which the plates of\r\nDaguerre presented. Sir John Herschel suggested the use of glass plates\r\ncoated with sensitive photographic films, and Niepce de Saint-Victor\r\nsucceeded in fixing upon glass layers of albumen (white of egg)\r\ncontaining the silver salts, a method which is still used to some\r\nextent. The art received, however, its greatest stimulus from the\r\nimprovements which ensued on the application of _collodion_ to this\r\npurpose. Collodion (κολλα, glue; in allusion to its adhesiveness) is the\r\nname which has been given to a solution in ether of gun-cotton, or of a\r\nsubstance nearly allied to it. Its employment was suggested by Le Grey\r\nof Paris, but the late Mr. Archer was the first to carry the idea into\r\npractice, and the process which he described in “The Chemist,” in 1851,\r\nis virtually that which is now almost universally adopted. This process\r\nhas now been tested, for nearly a quarter of a century, by the united\r\nexperience of photographers all over the world, and it is agreed that it\r\nis surpassed by no other, for it secures every quality which a\r\nphotograph can possess.[13] The minor details of the method can be, and\r\nare, infinitely varied; scarcely two experienced photographers will be\r\nfound working the process in identically the same manner throughout.\r\nBefore giving an outline of the collodion process, it may be well to say\r\nsomething respecting the chief instrument of photography—the camera.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  (1875) But see below, page 541.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 308.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary photographic camera is almost too well known to require\r\ndescription. In its simplest form, Fig. 308, it is merely a rectangular\r\nbox, in front of which is placed the lens, which slides in a tube, that\r\nits position may be adjusted so as to bring the rays to a focus on the\r\nsurface of a piece of ground glass at the opposite end. This glass is\r\nfitted into a light frame, which slides in grooves, so that it can be\r\nraised vertically out of its position, and replaced by another frame, B,\r\nwhich contains a recess for the reception for the sensitive plate, and a\r\nsliding screen which protects it from light until the right moment. When\r\nthis frame is placed in the camera, the sensitive surface occupies the\r\nsame position as that of the ground glass, and the sliding screen is\r\ndrawn up the moment before the operator removes from the front of the\r\nlens a cap which he places there after adjusting the focus. The sliding\r\nscreen is usually made with a narrow strip at the lower part, joined to\r\nthe rest by a hinge, so that when it has been drawn up it may be\r\nretained in its position, and placed out of the way, by being folded\r\ndown horizontally. There is commonly provision for two plates in one\r\nframe, the slides, &c., being doubled, and the plates placed back to\r\nback, as shown at B, Fig. 308. The camera is usually made in two parts,\r\nas shown in the figure, that at the back sliding within the other, so\r\nthat a wider range for adjustment is obtained, and the same camera may\r\neven be used with lenses of different focal lengths. Many improvements\r\nhave been made in the camera, by which it has been rendered more\r\nportable, and capable of more adjustments to suit varying circumstances.\r\nFig. 309 represents a “bellows” or folding camera, which appears to\r\nsupply every requirement for the studio. It is copied from Messrs.\r\nNegretti and Zambra’s catalogue, as are also the other figures of\r\nphotographic apparatus here given. Fig. 307 represents a camera for\r\ntaking stereoscopic views, fitted with two lenses, so that the two views\r\nare taken simultaneously on one plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 309.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo piece of apparatus used by the photographer is of so much importance\r\nas the lens; for good pictures cannot be obtained without well-defined,\r\nsharp images on the sensitive plate, and these images must have\r\nsufficient intensity to produce the required amount of chemical action\r\nin a short space of time. The formation of an image by means of a lens\r\nwhich is thickest at the centre is tolerably familiar to everybody; for\r\nmost persons must have noticed that the lens of a pair of spectacles, or\r\nof an eye-glass, will produce an inverted image of the window-frame on a\r\nsheet of white paper, held a certain distance behind the lens. But the\r\ndiagrams by which the paths of the rays are usually represented seem to\r\nconvey a false impression to an ordinary reader, who usually goes away\r\nwith the idea that somehow three rays are sent off by the object, and\r\nthat one goes through the middle of the lens, and the other two meet it\r\nand produce an image. Let us suppose that, by means of a circular\r\neye-glass, the image of a window is projected on a piece of white paper:\r\na straight line passing through the centre of the glass perpendicular to\r\nits plane will meet the window and image each at a certain point. The\r\npoint in which it meets the image is the _focus_ of _innumerable_ rays,\r\nwhich issue from the point in the window; that is, of the whole light\r\nsent out in every direction by the point a certain portion falls upon\r\nthe lens, and by the refraction it undergoes in passing through it, the\r\nrays are again brought together at the point in the image. Thus the\r\noriginal point in the object is the apex of a solid cone of rays (if we\r\nmay say so), of which the lens is the base, and the point in the image\r\nis the apex of another cone, having also the lens as its base. These\r\ncones would be termed _right_ cones, because their bases are\r\nperpendicular to their _axes_, or central lines. But they represent the\r\nrays from only _one point_ of the object. Let us now consider how the\r\nimage of another point is formed, say one in the highest part of the\r\nobject which forms an image on the screen. Those rays which are sent out\r\nby this point, and fall upon the lens, form now an _oblique_ cone, of\r\nwhich the lens is the base, and the central ray will pass through the\r\nmiddle of the lens and continue its journey on the other side with\r\nlittle or no change of direction, forming also the axis of another\r\noblique cone, constituted of the refracted rays, all of which will meet\r\ntogether at the lowest part of the image. Similar cones of incident and\r\nrefracted rays, all having the lens as base, and all of them cones more\r\nor less oblique, will be formed by the light from each point of the\r\nobject. Thus, the rays which issue from each point are brought together\r\nagain in a series of points which have the same position with regard to\r\neach other, and collectively form an inverted image.\r\n\r\nOn carefully looking at the image, say of a window-frame, formed by a\r\nsimple lens, the reader will observe two defects. The first is that the\r\nimage cannot be made equally clear and well defined at the centre and at\r\nthe edges: the adjustment which gives clear definition of one part\r\nleaves the other with blurred outlines. The second defect, which is best\r\nseen with large lenses, consists in coloured fringes surrounding the\r\noutlines of the objects. This depends upon the unequal refrangibility of\r\nthe various rays, but it is obviated in _achromatic_ lenses, which are\r\nformed of two or more different kinds of glass, so adapted that the\r\nrefracting power of the compound lens is retained, and the most powerful\r\nrays of the spectrum are brought to a common focus. Such are the lenses\r\nalways used in the photographic camera, and the skill of the optician is\r\ntaxed to so combine them as to obtain, not only the union of the\r\nprincipal rays in one focus, but the greatest possible flatness of field\r\nin the image, the largest amount of light, the widest angle without\r\ndistortion of the picture, and other qualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 310.\r\n]\r\n\r\nPhotographers have even been so fastidious in the matter of lenses as to\r\nrequire all the perfection of finish which is given to the\r\nobject-glasses of astronomical telescopes. Mr. Dallmeyer has made\r\nphotographic lenses which cost upwards of £250; but it is doubtful\r\nwhether the pictures formed by these would show any marked superiority\r\nover those produced by lenses costing only one-fifth of that amount.\r\nFig. 310 shows the construction of the combination usually employed for\r\ntaking photographic portraits. A is a section showing the forms and\r\npositions of the different lenses; B is an external view of the brass\r\nmounting of the lens. It is provided with a flange, C, which is attached\r\nby screws to the woodwork of the camera; and within the short tube, of\r\nwhich this is a part, slides the tube carrying the lenses, being\r\nfurnished with a rack and pinion moved by the milled head, E. D is a cap\r\nfor covering up the front of the sliding tube. A slit in the tube admits\r\nof plates of metal, perforated with circular openings, being inserted.\r\nThe openings are of various sizes; and these “stops” or diaphragms\r\nenable the operator to regulate the amount of light; and to cut off when\r\nrequired the rays passing through the marginal parts of the lens.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to describe in a few words a method of photography which\r\nwas, and still is, much practised, namely, the _collodion process_. The\r\ncollodion solution is prepared by dissolving one part of pyroxylin\r\n(gun-cotton) in ninety parts of ether and sixty of alcohol. The\r\npyroxylin for this purpose may be obtained by steeping cotton-wool for a\r\nfew minutes in a mixture of nitre and sulphuric acid, with certain\r\nprecautions which need not here be mentioned. To the solution of\r\ncollodion is added a certain quantity of iodide of potassium, or of\r\niodide of ammonium; and sometimes other substances also are mixed with\r\nthe solution with a view of increasing the sensitiveness of the plate\r\nwhen ready for exposure. Some of the collodion solution is poured on a\r\nwell-cleaned plate of glass, which is placed horizontally; it spreads\r\nover the plate, and the excess having been poured back into the bottle,\r\nthe evaporation of the liquids leaves the glass covered with a thin\r\nuniform transparent film, which firmly adheres. The next operation is to\r\nrender the plate sensitive by means of the “silver bath.” This is a\r\nneutral solution of nitrate of silver, one part to fifteen of pure\r\nwater, which is placed in a trough of glass or porcelain, Fig. 311. By\r\nthe aid of a proper support the plate is introduced quickly and steadily\r\ninto the solution, immediately after the collodion film has been formed\r\non its surface. In two or three minutes the layer of collodion becomes\r\nimpregnated with iodide of silver, and when taken out of the bath, the\r\nplate exhibits a creamy-looking surface. The operation of sensitizing\r\nthe plate by the silver bath must be performed in a room to which no\r\nlight has access, except that which has passed through _red_ or _yellow\r\nglass_, or a semi-transparent yellow screen.\r\n\r\nThe plate is now ready for immediate exposure in the camera. It is\r\nplaced in the dark slide, in which it is conveyed to the camera; and\r\nthere the image of the object is allowed to fall upon it for a time,\r\nwhich varies, according to the intensity of the light and the nature of\r\nthe object, from 3 seconds to 45 seconds. The slide is withdrawn from\r\nthe camera, and taken again to the “dark” room, _i.e._, where only\r\n_yellow_ or _red_ light can reach it. If the plate be now examined, it\r\nwill be found to present no trace of an image. A latent one, however,\r\nexists; and it is developed by pouring over the plate a solution of\r\npyrogallic acid—one part to 480 of water, with commonly a little alcohol\r\nand acetic acid added. When it is desired to intensify the image still\r\nmore, a few drops of the nitrate of silver solution is added to the\r\n_developing solution_ immediately before pouring it on the plate. When\r\nthe picture has become sufficiently distinct, it is washed with pure\r\nwater, and then immersed in a strong solution of hyposulphite of soda.\r\nThe last operation is termed by photographers “fixing” the picture, and\r\nthe substance employed in it is invaluable to the art. It acts as a\r\nready solvent of all the salts of silver which remain on the plate; and\r\nthe discovery of this property of the hyposulphites by Sir J. Herschel,\r\nin 1839, marked an era in photography. The picture is then thoroughly\r\nwashed in cold water, in order that the hyposulphite of soda may be\r\nentirely dissolved out. It is then dried, warmed before a fire, and\r\nfinally the film is covered with a coat of transparent varnish, by which\r\nit is protected from mechanical injury. The image here is\r\n_negative_—that is, the strongest lights of the object appear as the\r\ndarkest tints in the picture, and _vice versâ_. From it any number of\r\n_positive_ pictures may be obtained by means of the sensitive paper\r\nprepared with chloride of silver as in Fox Talbot’s plan.\r\n\r\nAs it is a tedious, and perhaps, in some cases, an impossible operation\r\nto completely remove all traces of silver salts and hyposulphites from\r\nphotographs, they have frequently been found to fade; but this is rarely\r\nthe case with well-prepared specimens. Processes have, however, been\r\ndevised by which absolute permanence is secured for the photograph. One\r\nof the best of these is known as the Carbon Printing Process, and, as\r\nimproved by Mr. Swan, it is thus practised:\r\n\r\nA solution of gelatine is coloured by the addition of Indian ink, or any\r\nother pigment which will give the desired tone. This solution is spread\r\nover sheets of paper which are then dried. In this condition the paper\r\nmay be preserved for any length of time without any special precautions.\r\nWhen it is required for use, it is floated, with the gelatine-covered\r\nside downwards, in a solution of bichromate of potash, and then dried;\r\nbut these operations must be carried on in the dark. The paper is\r\nexposed under a negative photograph, with which its prepared side is in\r\ncontact. The effect of the light is to render insoluble the gelatine on\r\nall those parts on which it has fallen, and this action extends to a\r\ndepth in the layer proportionate to the intensity of the illumination.\r\nThe object is, therefore, to wash away all the _soluble_ gelatine and\r\nthe colour with which it is mixed; but this soluble gelatine is mainly\r\non the side of the film which is in contact with the paper. The gelatine\r\nsurface is therefore made to adhere to another piece of paper by means\r\nof some substance insoluble in water; and when this has been done, the\r\nwhole is immersed in warm water. Then the soluble gelatine is soon\r\ndissolved; the first paper floats off, and the insoluble gelatine,\r\nholding the Indian ink or other colouring matter in its substance,\r\nremains attached by the cement. As the thickness of the layer rendered\r\ninsoluble is in proportion to the intensity of the light passing through\r\neach part of the negative, the picture will be presented in all the\r\nproper gradations of light and shade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 311.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe “wet collodion” process, that has been described on the preceding\r\npage, maintained an almost undisputed hold for more than twenty years in\r\nthe practice of photography in all branches, and it was not until after\r\nthe publication of the first edition of the present work that a new era\r\nin the art was commenced by the introduction of what is known as the\r\n_dry plate gelatino-bromide process_, to which the present enormous\r\npopularity of photography as a recreative art is due. The difficulties\r\nof manipulation, the necessity for extensive experience, and for special\r\nand cumbersome appliances were obstacles it at once removed. And not\r\nonly so, but the whole scope of the art was extended; for work that was\r\nbefore supposed impracticable, even to the most expert professional\r\nphotographer, became the amusement of the amateur. Here, we may remark\r\nin passing, that photography is greatly indebted for this, and many\r\nother improvements, to the enthusiasm of the amateur, which has\r\naccelerated the development of the art to a remarkable extent. The\r\ncollodion process itself admitted of being modified as a dry plate\r\nmethod, by coating the film with a preservative solution of tannin, gum,\r\nalbumen, or other substance, and then drying the plates, of course in a\r\ndark place. This plan made it possible to practise out-door photography\r\nwith ease, and such plates were, at one time, much used for landscape\r\nphotography, but they have now been almost superseded by the gelatine\r\nplates. It was Mr. Bennet, who, in 1874, first introduced the use of\r\nsensitive emulsions of gelatine, and the advantages offered by their\r\nuse, caused them to be soon adopted by landscape and amateur\r\nphotographers. In 1878, Mr. Bennet showed, that these plates could be\r\nmade wonderfully rapid in their action, so that portraits, etc., could\r\nbe taken by them in an unprecedentedly short time. The preparation of\r\nthe dry gelatine plates was then commenced on a large scale, and these\r\nwere found so convenient, and reliable in use, that they were adopted by\r\nthe professional photographers, who had hitherto adhered to the wet\r\ncollodion and silver bath, from long habit and established associations.\r\nThe collodion processes are, however, still much used, and are preferred\r\nby many to the gelatine plates; indeed, it is admitted, that only by the\r\nformer can certain desirable qualities of negatives be obtained, which\r\nare of great importance in some applications of the art.\r\n\r\nThere are, it need hardly be said, many modifications of the processes\r\nrecommended for preparing gelatino-bromide dry plates, and each\r\nmanufacturer of the various kinds offered for sale has, no doubt, his\r\nown special plan and formula. In all, a very fine and carefully selected\r\nquality of gelatine is the medium in which the sensitive salts are\r\nembedded. An “emulsion” is prepared by adding to warm gelatine solution\r\nexactly determined quantities of solutions of certain compounds, of\r\nwhich a bromide (usually bromide of potassium) and silver nitrate are\r\nthe essential ones, together with a small proportion of iodide of\r\npotassium. Minute quantities of iodine, hydrochloric acid, etc., are\r\nalso often prescribed as additions. The mixture has to be heated, at the\r\nboiling temperature, for three quarters of an hour, then cooled, and\r\nmixed with more gelatine solution, or, instead of using acid and iodine\r\nand boiling, a little ammonia is added. When cold and set, the gelatine\r\nis washed with cold water, while squeezed through canvas, or after it\r\nhas been cut into thin strips. It is then drained, dissolved at a gentle\r\nheat, and filtered warm. The clean glass plates are coated over with it,\r\nat the temperature of 120° F., and are set aside in a perfectly\r\nhorizontal position until the gelatine has set, when they are placed for\r\ntwenty-four hours in a drying cupboard, maintained at 80° F. It will be\r\nunderstood that these operations are conducted in a room where no light\r\nenters, except through a frame of ruby-coloured glass, and the plates,\r\nwhen dry, are carefully packed and stored in light-tight boxes. They are\r\nmarvellously sensitive, and receive the photographic impression in about\r\none-sixtieth (1/60th) of the time required for wet collodion plates.\r\nHalf a second exposure in the camera may be sufficient to impress the\r\nimage of a well lighted landscape, even when a very small stop is used,\r\nand it is not unusual to employ for extra sensitive plates, a so-called\r\n“instantaneous shutter,” when the exposure may be no more than 1/80th to\r\n1/100th of a second, and yet obtain a perfectly strong image. Dry plates\r\nare manufactured in vast numbers in many large establishments, and the\r\noperations are carried on to a great extent by the aid of machinery, by\r\nwhich the plates are uniformly coated and automatically carried into\r\ndrying chambers, etc.\r\n\r\nIf photography were popular before the introduction of the dry\r\ngelatino-bromide plates, it has since become a hundred-fold more so.\r\nIndeed, the camera is now seen everywhere, and few are the family\r\ncircles in which at least one amateur practitioner of the art is not to\r\nbe found; indeed, the technical terms of the art have become “Familiar\r\nin their mouths as household words.” The daguerrotype, notwithstanding\r\nits cost, had no sooner become a practicable process for taking\r\nlikenesses, than it began to supersede miniature painting, and how\r\nrapidly it rose into general favour may be inferred from the fact that,\r\nin 1850, ten years after its introduction, it was estimated that in the\r\nUnited States of America, at least ten thousand persons had made it\r\ntheir profession, and, probably half as many more were occupied in\r\nmaking and selling chemicals, plates, cameras, lenses, mounting cases,\r\nand other apparatus connected with its practice. Such being the demand\r\nfor photographic portraits, at the period when the sitter had, as we\r\nhave already seen, to remain motionless for two whole minutes in\r\nsunlight, we can hardly be surprised at the increased popularity the art\r\nhas acquired in the last decade, when a picture can be produced with\r\none-hundredth the length of sitting, and at about the same reduction of\r\ncost. It may here be mentioned, that Daguerre’s process is still\r\noccasionally used for special purposes; it was, for instance, the method\r\nselected for obtaining the photographic records in the expedition sent\r\nout by the French Government, in 1874, to observe the transit of Venus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 311_a_.—_The Roll-Slide._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe dry plate processes have given an immense impulse to landscape\r\nphotography, and travellers have been able to bring back authentic\r\nrepresentations of the scenery and inhabitants from every part of the\r\nglobe. This advantage arises from the fact that having the camera, and\r\nits appurtenances, the tourist or traveller is not obliged to carry\r\nanything about with him except his plates, and when these have once been\r\nexposed in the camera, and stowed away in light-tight boxes, the latent\r\nimages may be developed months, or even years, afterwards. But glass\r\nplates are heavy, and are liable to accidental breakage. Inventive\r\ningenuity has been actively at work for the past few years, to find a\r\nmeans of obviating these remaining inconveniences. The first method\r\nadopted was to employ paper instead of glass, as a support for the\r\nsensitive gelatine film. The paper, having been cut to the proper size,\r\nis placed on a _film-carrier_, which is usually a thin plate of ebonite,\r\nby which the paper is kept flat. These carriers take the place of the\r\nglass plates in the ordinary dark slide, and after exposure in the usual\r\nway, the papers are removed in the dark room and made up into\r\nlight-tight packages, where, of course, a large number will occupy but a\r\nsmall space, and the weight of them be wholly negligible. Many persons\r\nmake use of this arrangement, which has the advantages of simplicity and\r\nof requiring no special apparatus. But an improvement was soon brought\r\nout, which consists in substituting for the carriers and pieces of\r\nsensitive paper a continuous roll of the material. For this purpose a\r\nspecial piece of apparatus, called the roll-holder, is made to take the\r\nplace of the dark slide at the back of the camera. The arrangement will\r\nbe readily understood from Fig. 311_a_. The figure shows the apparatus\r\nin section, but only the disposition of the principal parts, most of the\r\nmechanical details being omitted. R R´ are two metallic or wooden\r\nrollers, which admit of being readily put in their places and taken out.\r\nUpon one of these, R, the full length of the material is previously\r\nwound, and the free end is passed over another roller, _r´_, and across\r\nthe opening at E O, where the exposure is made. There is in front of\r\nthis a dark slide (not here shown) to be drawn up when everything is\r\nready for uncovering the lens. Immediately behind the paper is a flat\r\nplate of ebonite, E, or a smooth black board, the object of which is to\r\nkeep the material quite flat as it passes over the opening to the\r\nroller, _r´_, which guides it to the roll, R´, on which it is wound as\r\nrequired. S S´ are two small rollers always pressed by springs against\r\nthe rolls to prevent the turns working loose. There is a registering\r\napparatus outside in connection with one of the rollers, _r_, or _r´_,\r\nto show when the proper length of material has been wound across the\r\nopening for a new exposure; and at the same time a mark is automatically\r\nmade on the paper to indicate where the negatives are to be separated\r\nfor development by cutting the paper. Some forms of the apparatus also\r\ncall the operator’s attention to the sufficient winding of the roll by\r\nan audible signal, a stroke on a little bell tells that everything is\r\nready for a new exposure. In some cases the number of exposures already\r\nmade is registered by figures that appear on the outside. The paper in\r\nthese processes is used only as a temporary support; for after the\r\nnegative has been developed in the ordinary way, the sensitive gelatine\r\nfilm is removed from it and made to adhere firmly on a plate of clear\r\nglass, from which prints are taken as usual. The operations required for\r\nthe transferring require considerable dexterity of manipulation, and to\r\nboth the paper and the glass special preparations have to be applied,\r\nbefore and after the transference of the film. This plan, therefore, of\r\n“stripping films” involves so great a number of delicate and somewhat\r\ntroublesome operations that very many photographers have preferred to\r\nencounter the labour and risks of carrying about with them the more\r\neasily manageable glass plates. But what if some grainless, transparent\r\nsubstance could replace the paper in these rolls so that the negatives\r\nmight be ready for printing from when merely developed and fixed? Many\r\ntrials have been made to find this desideratum. A material sufficiently\r\ntranslucent, even, and of tenacity enough to bear the stretching strain\r\nbetween the rollers has, it is believed, been discovered in a very\r\nsingular substance previously used for other purposes. The reader is no\r\ndoubt familiar with it as the substitute for ivory in combs, knife\r\nhandles, and other small articles. It is called _celluloid_, and is a\r\ncomposition the principal ingredients of which would never be guessed\r\nfrom its appearance—namely gun-cotton and camphor! This material is\r\nprepared in a plastic condition that enables it to be shaped into any\r\nrequired form. It can be drawn into threads or rolled out into very thin\r\nfilms. Thin plates of it have been used in photography as a substitute\r\nfor glass, for the sake of lightness, before its employment as a\r\ntransparent film in the roll-holders. We have now at length the\r\nequipment of the travelling photographer reduced to the utmost\r\nconceivable limits of lightness and compactness. Thus the complete\r\napparatus required for taking hundreds of pictures of a good size need\r\nnot be more than a few pounds in weight, and can easily be carried in\r\nthe hand. But even quite small negatives can now be very readily printed\r\nin a few seconds on paper, with an enlargement of many times the\r\noriginal dimensions. The resources of the photographic art appear indeed\r\nto be endless; but a mere statement of even the more interesting of\r\nthese would lead us beyond our limits, and descriptions of the details\r\nof manipulation are out of our province altogether. But a few of the\r\nmore recent applications and developments of the art scarcely or not at\r\nall alluded to in the foregoing pages should receive some attention.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary sensitiveness of the gelatine-bromide film which makes\r\nit possible to impress on it a photographic image in the merest fraction\r\nof a second of time, enables us to take pictures of objects in rapid\r\nmotion. Express trains at their highest speed have been successfully\r\nphotographed, and so has almost every moving object in nature. The\r\nphotographs that have been taken of men, of birds, horses, and other\r\nanimals in every phase of their most rapid actions, have solved many\r\ndisputed and perplexing problems as to the nature of their movements,\r\nand sometimes the solutions have been of a very unexpected kind. Taking\r\na photographic “shot” at a bird has become almost more than a figure of\r\nspeech; for there are contrivances by which a bird on the wing may be\r\naimed at with the lens, and hit off on the sensitive plate with a\r\ncertainty surpassing that of the fowling-piece. There are also\r\nphotographic repeaters by which six or more successive photographs of\r\nthe bird, etc., can be taken in a single second. Mr. Muybridge has\r\npublished a number of such photographs of the horse, and by projection\r\nof the different images on a screen from a magic lantern, in rapid\r\nsuccession, he has been able to reproduce the visual appearance of\r\nhorses trotting, leaping, galloping, etc., on the principle of the\r\nzoetrope (page 399). Photography has afforded wonderfully delicate\r\nobservations in many departments of science, by recording phenomena too\r\nrapid for the eye to seize, or too recondite for direct perception. A\r\nfew examples may be mentioned. First, the advantage of photographing the\r\nlines of spectra, such as those described in our article on the\r\nspectroscope, will at once suggest themselves, and accordingly this\r\nmethod of recording spectra has been largely used, and in the hands of\r\nMr. Lockyer, Dr. Draper, and others has been successfully applied to the\r\nstudy of the solar and stellar spectra. But more than this, it is the\r\nsensitive photographic plate that has enabled us to explore the region\r\nof the solar spectrum lying far beyond its visible limits in the red and\r\nin the violet rays. The ultra-violet portion of the spectrum is shown\r\nphotographically to be occupied by multitudes of the thin insensitive\r\nspaces—breaks in the continuity of the active rays—which are impressed\r\non the photographic print as black lines, similar in every respect to\r\nthe lines mapped out in the visible spectrum by Fraunhofer. It is known\r\nby these that the ultra-violet spectrum, produced by glass prisms,\r\nextends to a distance beyond the last visible rays of nearly double the\r\nspace occupied by the colour spectrum. The principal lines, or rather\r\nthe greater groups of lines in the invisible spectrum, are distinguished\r\nby the capital letters of the alphabet, in continuation of Fraunhofer’s\r\nmethod, beginning from H and nearly exhausting the letters of the\r\nalphabet to designate them. These are photographed _in the dark_; for\r\nall the solar beams that are allowed to enter the stereoscope are first\r\npassed through blue glass of such a depth that every kind of emanation\r\ncapable of affecting the human eye is intercepted.\r\n\r\nAnother extremely interesting example of the application of the art to\r\nscientific research is celestial photography. An image of the sun may be\r\nimpressed on a sensitive plate in an ordinary camera, in an amazingly\r\nshort space of time, but such image is much too small to show any of the\r\nmarkings on the disc of our luminary, even when the image is magnified,\r\nfor its diameter is only about ⅒th of an inch for each 12 inches of the\r\nfocal length of the lens. In order to obtain an image of 4 inches\r\ndiameter, a lens of 40 feet focal length must therefore be used. The\r\nfirst attempts in solar photography appear to have been made in France,\r\nin 1845, and the solar prominences were daguerrotyped in 1851; but it\r\nwas not until 1860, that Mr. De La Rue succeeded in obtaining some\r\nbeautiful negatives of the phenomena presented in an eclipse of the sun,\r\nand was thus enabled to determine a great astronomical problem, by\r\nshowing that the red flames, or prominences, really belonged to the sun\r\nitself. At the present time, photographs of parts of the sun’s disc are\r\nregularly taken at Kew, and other observatories, without the very long\r\nand heavy telescopes, which introduced many mechanical difficulties into\r\nthe operation; for, by means of Foucault’s siderostat, the great lens\r\nand the photographic apparatus can be used in one fixed position. The\r\nsiderostat is an instrument on which a flat mirror, made of glass worked\r\nto a perfect plane and silvered externally, is caused by clockwork to\r\nfollow the motion of the sun, so that the reflected beams can be\r\nprojected in any required direction unchangeably, and, therefore the\r\nimage of the sun (or other heavenly bodies) viewed in the mirror, is\r\nabsolutely stationary. The lens, carried in a short tube, has its axis\r\ndirected to this image, just as it would be pointed at the luminary\r\nitself. In solar photography, the exposure is made through a very narrow\r\nslit in an opaque screen, which is caused to move rapidly in front of\r\nthe image. Very fair photographic images of the sun, of several inches\r\ndiameter, can, however, be obtained with an ordinary telescope of five\r\nfeet or so focal length, by substituting a small photographic lens and\r\ncamera in the eye-piece, and by enlarging the image in printing.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1840, Dr. Draper succeeded in daguerrotyping the moon, but\r\nit was not until 1851, that lunar photographs, obtained by Professor\r\nBond, another American astronomer, were first exhibited in England. Many\r\nother distinguished experimenters have since successfully turned their\r\nattention to this subject, such as Dancer, of Manchester, Secchi,\r\nCrookes, Huggins, Phillips, and De La Rue. The latter, and also Mr. Fry,\r\nby photographing the moon, at different periods of her libration, have\r\nobtained very beautiful and interesting _stereoscopic_ prints of our\r\nsatellite, in which she presents to the eye the roundness and solidity\r\nof a cannon ball. Mr. Rutherford, in America, had an object glass of 11¼\r\ninches diameter, made expressly with correction for the chemical rays,\r\nand with this instrument he has produced some of the finest photographs\r\nof the moon that have yet been taken. Reflecting telescopes, which have\r\nthe advantage of uniting all the rays in one focus, have been used with\r\nexcellent results, and it is said that some taken with the great\r\nreflector at Melbourne, where also the atmospheric conditions are very\r\nfavourable, are almost perfect.\r\n\r\nExcellent photographs of the planets have also been taken by Mr.\r\nCommon and others; but they are of course small, and have contributed\r\nso far, much less to our astronomical knowledge than those already\r\nmentioned. Very different are the results obtained in what, a short\r\ntime ago, appeared a less promising field. The image of a so-called\r\nfixed star, in even the most powerful telescopes, presents itself as a\r\nmere luminous point, and this is the case whether the star is one of\r\nthe brightest or one of the least conspicuous. The telescopic\r\nappearance is simply a more or less brilliant point. The various\r\ndegrees of brightness which distinguish one star from another (_stella\r\nenim a stellâ differt in claritate_), and which the unassisted eye\r\nattributes to difference of size, led, long before the invention of\r\ntelescopes, to a classification of them accordingly. The brightest\r\nstars are said to be of the 1st “magnitude,” those of the next\r\ninferior degree of brilliancy, of the 2nd “magnitude,” and so on, down\r\nto the 6th, which includes the faintest star discernible by an acute\r\neye under favourable circumstances. But stars too faint to be thus\r\nseen came into view in the field of the telescope, and therefore those\r\nof the 7th magnitude, and beyond, are termed _telescopic_ stars, and\r\neach additional power given to the instrument brings others in view\r\nthat previously were invisible. The classification has been carried\r\ndown to the 18th or 20th magnitude, which expresses the limit of\r\nvisibility with the most powerful telescopes yet constructed. In the\r\nmethods hitherto employed for this classification, there is\r\nnecessarily much that is arbitrary and vague, and it is quite common\r\nto find a different magnitude assigned to the same star by different\r\nauthorities. Now the photographic plate enables the astronomer to\r\ndetermine the relative brightness of stars quite definitely. Everyone\r\nknows that the time required to impress an image on the sensitive\r\nplate is longer, as that image is less luminous. Hence, by finding the\r\ntime required for the images of different stars to be impressed, we\r\nhave a measure of their relative luminosities. Suppose the image of a\r\ngroup of stars is allowed to act on a plate for, say, 5 seconds, we\r\nshould find only the brightest stars represented. If a second plate\r\nhave double the exposure given, it would be impressed by the images of\r\nnot only the brightest stars of the group, but also by those of the\r\nnext degree of brilliancy; and a third plate exposed for 20 seconds\r\nwould show more stars than the two former exposures. So that plate\r\nafter plate might be exposed under the same group for successively\r\nlonger and longer intervals indefinitely. Exposures extending over\r\nhours have been made, notably by Mr. Common in England, and by Mr.\r\nGill at the Cape of Good Hope, showing not only how magnitude may be\r\ndetermined to any extent, and the heavens most accurately mapped out,\r\nbut with this very remarkable result:—_thousands of stars, invisible\r\neven in the most powerful telescopes, are portrayed in the\r\nphotographs_. Let us consider for a moment the significance of this\r\nfact with regard to the new space-exploring powers it has placed in\r\nthe hands of science. The number of stars visible to the unassisted\r\neye in the whole expanse of the heavens has been variously estimated,\r\nbut the figures usually given lie between 3,000 and 4,000, and the\r\nhighest estimate for the most acute eyesight, under the most\r\nfavourable atmospheric conditions, places the limit at 5,000. The\r\nbrightest star in the heavens is Sirius, and Sir. J. Herschel\r\nascertained that its light is about 324, that of an average star of\r\nthe 6th magnitude. Taking the average luminosities of stars of the\r\nfirst six magnitudes, Sir W. Herschel, from his own observations,\r\nrepresents their relative brightness by the following figures: 100;\r\n25; 12; 6; 2; 1. The different degrees of brightness seen is,\r\nprobably, due to the following three causes, combined in various\r\nproportions: (1) the different sizes of these luminaries themselves;\r\n(2) differences in their intrinsic luminosity; and, (3) differences in\r\ntheir distances from us. And it is also extremely probable that the\r\nlast is generally by far the largest factor of the three. It has been\r\nfound by photometrical experiments, that the light we receive from the\r\nsun is 20,000,000,000 (twenty thousand million) times more than that\r\nof Sirius. If we suppose Sirius to be in reality only as large and as\r\nbright as our sun, it follows that its distance from us must be no\r\nless than 13,433,000,000,000 miles. The distance of stars of the 16th\r\nmagnitude has been estimated to be such that their light—travelling at\r\nthe rate of 185,000 miles per second—takes between five and six\r\nthousand years to reach us. For a long time no sensible parallax could\r\nbe discovered in any of the fixed stars; that is, no change in their\r\npositions was discernible when viewed from points 183,000,000 miles\r\napart, namely from the extremities of a diameter of the earth’s orbit.\r\nIn other words, if we suppose the line of the length just mentioned to\r\nform the base of a triangle, having a star at its vertex, the angle\r\nformed by the sides is so small that the most refined instruments\r\nfailed to measure it. In recent times, however, the parallax of a few\r\nstars—about a dozen or so—has been detected and approximately\r\nmeasured. The greatest observed parallax belongs to in α the\r\nconstellation of the Centaur, a star of the first magnitude, 30° from\r\nthe south pole of the heavens, and of this the parallax amounts to but\r\na little more than nine-tenths of a second of angular measurement,\r\ncorresponding with a distance of nearly 20,000,000,000,000 miles, a\r\nspace which takes light 3½ years to pass over. This star is,\r\ntherefore, believed to be the nearest of any to our system. The\r\nsmallest parallax that has been measured in any of these few stars is\r\na fraction of a second of angle corresponding with a distance twenty\r\ntimes greater than the other, and requiring seventy years for light to\r\ntraverse it. Now, as the photographic plate shows us stars of\r\nmagnitudes indefinitely smaller even than the telescopic sixteenth, we\r\ncannot but marvel at the manner in which the light travelling from\r\nthese suns in the immeasurable depths of space, and taking untold\r\nthousands (nay, millions, it may be) of years in its journey is yet\r\nable so to agitate the atoms of our silver compounds that images of\r\nthings that will themselves, probably, never be seen by mortal eyes\r\nare presented to our view. A circumstance requiring explanation will\r\noccur to the reader’s mind in connection with stellar photography; and\r\nthat is, how does it happen that, if the image of a star is a mere\r\npoint, it nevertheless impresses the plate as a visible dot? It is\r\nprobably because the point is a centre whence the photographic\r\ninfluence radiates laterally on the plate to a small but yet sensible\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAmong the cosmic objects presented to our observation there are none\r\nmore fully charged with interest and instruction than the _Nebulæ_.\r\nThese are faintly luminous patches, in some few cases visible to the\r\nnaked eye, but for the most part telescopic. The milky way, which\r\nextends round the celestial sphere, is a very conspicuous phenomenon of\r\nthe same kind. A few other hazy, cloudlike patches are seen in various\r\nparts of the heavens, visible on a clear moonless night when the eye is\r\ndirected towards the proper quarter. The well known group of the\r\nPleiades sometimes presents this appearance, but most persons are able\r\nby the unassisted vision to discern in it a group of six stars at least,\r\nand an opera-glass or ordinary hand telescope easily resolves the object\r\ninto a cluster of 20 or 30 distinct stars. Telescopes of higher powers\r\nbring more stars into view, and as many as 118 have been counted in the\r\ngroup. There are several other groups of this kind perceptible to the\r\nnaked eyes merely as diffused patches of light, but resolvable by the\r\ntelescope into thickly clustered groups of minute stars; but in many of\r\nthe resolvable nebulæ the separate stars appear spread on a back-ground\r\nof diffused luminosity. Again, there are other nebulæ which telescopes\r\nof the highest powers we possess fail to resolve at all. Not only has\r\nthe photographic method shown stellar components of some of these last,\r\nbut it has depicted the form of nebulæ never seen at all, and whose\r\nexistence was previously unknown and unsuspected. For example, the\r\nphotograph has revealed the existence of a back-ground of nebulous\r\npatches to the stars of the Pleiades—a thing that had never before been\r\nsuspected, although the group has been repeatedly observed by the most\r\npowerful telescopes. Those who are at all acquainted with astronomy,\r\nwill understand the significance of this discovery for the science. The\r\nresults already obtained afford a marvellous support to the famous\r\nspeculation known as the nebular hypothesis. And as the forms of these\r\nobjects are accurately shown for us by their own light, changes in their\r\nappearance may thus be detected as time goes on which may serve to lift\r\nthe above named theory into the region of demonstrated truth. The nebulæ\r\nwhich neither telescope nor camera can resolve are such as the\r\nspectroscope proves to be masses of glowing gas or vapour.\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned that the light from these immeasurably\r\ndistant stars and nebulæ is so faint that the most sensitive\r\nphotographic plates have to be exposed for hours. This would be a matter\r\nof no difficulty if the clockwork mechanism by which the apparatus is\r\nmade to follow the apparent motion of the heavens could be constructed\r\nwith absolute perfection. But as this is not obtainable, even with the\r\nmost careful workmanship, and the smallest jar or irregularity would\r\ndistort and confuse the images, this source of disturbance is eliminated\r\nin the following manner: attached to the photographing apparatus and\r\ndriven with it is a telescope, provided with cross wires, and through\r\nthis an observer views some star during the whole period of the\r\nexposure, his business being to keep the image of the star accurately on\r\nthe cross wire, which he is enabled to do by having the means of\r\nslightly modifying the movement of the clockwork. In the Paris\r\nExhibition of 1889 were shown many very fine large photographic prints\r\nof nebulæ (notably of great nebula in Orion), which have recently been\r\nobtained in this manner, and those nebulæ that had been photographically\r\nresolved had the stellar components marked with wonderful distinctness.\r\nComets and meteorites have been photographed, and even the _aurora\r\nborealis_ and the lightning’s path have been brought within the camera’s\r\nken.\r\n\r\nSpace would fail us to describe the many applications now found for\r\nphotography in microscopy, in medicine and surgery, in anthropology, in\r\ncommerce, and in the arts. It is obvious also from the improvements that\r\nare continually made, that many of these applications have not yet\r\nreceived their full developments. Photography has been enlisted into the\r\nservice of the army and navy, and regular courses of instruction in the\r\nart are given in their training schools. A well equipped photographic\r\nwaggon now accompanies every army corps, and in almost every ship of\r\nwar, some proficient operator is to be found. By an ingenious\r\ncombination of photography, aerostatics and electricity, it is possible\r\nto obtain with perfect safety accurate information of the disposition of\r\nan enemy’s forces and fortifications. A small captive balloon is sent\r\nup, to which is attached a camera. At a height of a few hundred yards,\r\nthe balloon is practically safe from any projectiles, and in its cable\r\nare interwoven two electric wires by which currents are conveyed to\r\nelectro-magnets, which produce all the movements required for any number\r\nof exposures. Jurisprudence has found its account in recognizing the\r\nart, for the photograph is received in evidence for proving identity,\r\netc. The administration of the criminal law takes advantage of the art\r\nto secure the likeness of prisoners for future identification, and the\r\nmodern instantaneous process renders unnecessary the subjects’\r\nconcurrence with the operation. Again, if the “hue and cry” has to be\r\nraised for an individual “wanted” for any offence, and a photographic\r\nlikeness of him is procurable, thousands of copies can be made of it in\r\na few hours, by night as easily as by day, and distributed to every\r\npolice station in the whole country.\r\n\r\nModern processes now enable us to obtain prints from negatives in as\r\nmany seconds as a few years ago hours were required, and this by\r\nartificial light. A process of printing lately introduced and yielding\r\nartistic results which deserve to find more general favour, is that\r\ncalled the _platinotype_. Instead of the ordinary print produced on\r\nlightly glazed paper by the reduction of silver compounds, and of\r\nquestionable permanency, the image is formed in the paper by metallic\r\nplatinum, the most changeless of all possible substances under ordinary\r\ninfluences. The pictures are of a rich velvety black, with soft\r\ngradations, and the surface is without glaze or glare. The print has, in\r\nfact, the appearance and all the best qualities of the most highly\r\nfinished mezzotint engraving, combined with the minute fidelity\r\ncharacteristic of the photograph. The problem of producing a photograph\r\nin colours, permanently showing nature’s tints in all their gradations,\r\nhas still a great fascination for some experimenters, and startling\r\nannouncements are made from time to time of some discovery in this\r\ndirection. It does not appear, however, that any success has really been\r\narrived at, beyond the results long ago obtained by Becquerel as\r\ndescribed on page 614; and, indeed, as our knowledge of the science of\r\nthe subject increases, the less likely does the possibility of\r\nphotographing colours appear. It is, however, never safe to lay down the\r\nlimits of discovery in science.[14] Note that precisely in the matter of\r\nrendering colour even in its due gradation of tone or luminous\r\nintensity, the photograph is quite untruthful. Everybody has noticed how\r\nunnaturally dark and heavy the foliage of trees appears in the prints;\r\nif we suppose a lady in a blue dress, with yellow trimmings, to sit for\r\nher portrait, the photograph will show her in a white dress with black\r\ntrimmings; a sitter with light yellow or auburn hair will appear of\r\nquite a dark complexion; if you photograph a lemon and a plum together,\r\nthe latter will probably come out lighter than the former; or if a\r\ndaffodil be the subject, the flower will be drawn in tones much darker\r\nthan the leaves. This incorrectness of tone relations can, however, be\r\ngreatly lessened by the device of reducing the quantity of the blue\r\nrays, by interposing a piece of optically plane yellow-tinted glass, by\r\nusing the sensitive plates tinted with certain coal-tar dyes, which are\r\nnow prepared and sold under the name of “ortho-chromatic plates,” or by\r\nboth methods combined.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  See page 630.\r\n\r\nIf any illustration were needed of the great popularity now attained by\r\nthe practice of photography, reference might be made to the large number\r\nof periodicals devoted to the subject, and appearing weekly,\r\nfortnightly, quarterly or annually, in every civilised country, and also\r\nto the multitudes of societies that have been formed for the promotion\r\nof the art. In Great Britain alone there are now at least 150 such\r\nsocieties in active operation, and they are correspondingly numerous\r\nelsewhere. If, when we consider all that has been accomplished up to the\r\npresent time, with the jubilee year of photography scarcely passed, and\r\nobserve the increasing numbers of its cultivators guided by the\r\nexplanations of its phenomena that science is beginning to furnish, we\r\ncan expect a corresponding progress in the next fifty years, then the\r\ncentenary may be reached with a roll of achievements that could we know\r\nthem now we should think marvellous.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked elsewhere, the practical side of photography has\r\noutstripped the theoretical one, for so far its progress has been much\r\nless indebted for processes and technic to the direct guidance of\r\nscience than almost any other of our Nineteenth Century acquisitions,\r\nsuch as telegraphy, electric lighting, etc. The materials employed, and\r\nthe mode of manipulation, have certainly _not_ been deduced from\r\nprevious knowledge of the nature of light or from the laws of chemistry,\r\nalthough when, by repeated trials and happy guesses, the right direction\r\nhad been found, the field into which it led could be more easily\r\nexplored under the direction of chemistry and physics. But even yet the\r\nfundamental principle, or the precise nature of the action of light on\r\ncertain compounds, has not been definitely made out, and although some\r\ntheories on the subject have been proposed, no one has been generally\r\naccepted as an adequate explanation of the known facts, and still less\r\nhave any quantitative relations been established for these actions. The\r\nphotographer cannot compose a formula for the composition of his\r\nemulsions and developers from assured data like those that enable the\r\nchemist to weigh out with accuracy the constituents that go to produce a\r\nrequired compound.\r\n\r\nThe attainment of permanency in its products, which, by several\r\nprocesses, photography can now boast of, is one of its triumphs, and\r\nwill tend greatly to enlarge the sphere of its utility. For example, we\r\nhave a public institution, known as the National Portrait Gallery, in\r\nwhich it is sought to gather together and preserve the likenesses of the\r\nmost eminent Englishmen, and presentments of such of far less fidelity\r\nthan photographic portraits are eagerly sought after. It has been\r\nsuggested that something like a National Gallery of _permanent\r\nphotographic portraits_ of the chief men of their time would be a\r\nfitting and acceptable legacy to the public of the future. This idea has\r\nmuch to recommend it, particularly as authentic likenesses would thus be\r\nsecured for the nation beyond the chance of loss.\r\n\r\nPhotography has been applied in preparing blocks in relief for printing\r\nalong with letterpress in the same way as woodcut blocks. The process\r\nhas the great advantage of producing in a wonderfully short time a\r\nperfect facsimile of the artist’s drawing without the intervention of\r\nany engraver. A plate of zinc, brass, or copper, coated with a dried\r\nfilm of bichromated albumen, is exposed to light under the transparent\r\nnegative of a drawing in pure line, that is, one having in it only lines\r\nof uniform colour throughout. The parts of the film reached by the\r\nlight, which correspond with the lines of the original design, are\r\nrendered insoluble, while the rest can readily be removed by water.\r\nThese unprotected parts have then to be removed by the action of acids,\r\nbut these are used alternately with the application to the plate of\r\ncertain compositions, the purpose of which is to prevent lateral erosion\r\nof the lines in relief before the requisite depth of the metal has been\r\nremoved. Fig. 147_f_ is the reproduction of a pen-and-ink sketch by this\r\nor some similar process. But nature and the ordinary photograph show us\r\ngraduated tones which ordinary printers’ ink cannot really reproduce,\r\ninasmuch as it is incapable of gradation, and can give the _effect_ of\r\ngradation only by such devices as are mentioned on page 642 (last\r\nsentence). Now, the photograph cannot yield a printing-block until its\r\ncontinuous tones are broken up into lines or dots. Not a few methods of\r\ndoing this have been contrived, but that which is by far the most\r\ncommonly used, and is most successfully practised on the commercial\r\nscale, is simple in principle, although in actual working it calls for\r\nmuch experience and skill. The negative is taken upon a wet collodion\r\nplate, in front of which, within the camera, and at a very short\r\ndistance (say 1/30th inch) from the film, is a transparent _screen_,\r\nbearing two sets of parallel opaque lines at right angles to each other.\r\nThese lines are mechanically ruled with the utmost regularity, and are\r\nseparated by only very small intervals. There may be from 80 to 200 of\r\nthem in the space of one inch, according to the class of work required.\r\nThe effect of this is that the light reaches the photographic film\r\nthrough a series of minute transparent squares, the sides of which may\r\nbe only from the 1/140th to the 1/400th of an inch in length. Now it is\r\nfound that the brighter lights from the original positive, after passing\r\nthese small apertures, spread so as to more or less cover the opposite\r\nparts of the negative, while the feebler lights, from the shades of the\r\noriginal, impress the plate to a less degree, the developed image in\r\nthese showing, perhaps, merely a small dot or, in the very darkest\r\nparts, a blank. In this way, then, may the photographic negative be\r\nobtained with a granulated texture following in graduation the tones of\r\nthe original. After this, the rest is easy, for the process of exposing\r\na metal plate, coated with a sensitive film under the negative, and of\r\netching it with acids, etc., is essentially the same as in the\r\nforegoing. Such is the _half-tone process_, which is now so largely\r\nsuperseding wood and other engraving. It is unnecessary to describe\r\ntechnical details here, such as the employment of _bitumen of Judæa_ as\r\nthe coating for the metal plate, or how the image must be reflected into\r\nthe lens from a mirror to avoid a reversal in the final print, etc.\r\nThere are endless modifications of the processes briefly mentioned\r\nabove, and some of these are guarded as valuable trade secrets. Several\r\nof the illustrations in this work are prepared by the half-tone process,\r\nof which plates I., IV., V., etc., are examples, and they should be\r\nexamined with a strong lens, in order that the different rendering of\r\nthe light and the dark parts may be compared.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _PHOTOGRAPHY IN COLOURS._\r\n\r\nIt is the statement as to the futility of assigning limits to scientific\r\ndiscovery that has been justified by facts. The preceding edition of\r\nthis work was not long in the hands of its readers before the solution\r\nof the problem of photography in colours was announced from Paris,\r\nwhere, at the close of 1890, the physicist M. Lippmann had succeeded in\r\nphotographing the solar spectrum in its natural colours, and at the\r\nbeginning of 1891, he was able to exhibit at the Academy of Science\r\nuntouched photographs of a stained glass window in three colours, of a\r\ndish of oranges and red flowers, and of a gorgeously coloured parrot,\r\nall in their natural tints. The method employed had no apparent relation\r\nto that of Becquerel, but was of the simplest, and, moreover, one which\r\nany reader who has followed the first few pages of our section on the\r\n“Causes of Light and Colours” will have little difficulty in completely\r\nunderstanding, if he has devoted a little attention to Fresnel’s\r\ninterference experiment. M. Lippmann took a photographic plate, coated\r\nto a greater depth than usual with a gelatine film containing the\r\nsensitive salts of silver, and in the camera this plate was exposed with\r\nthe glass towards the lens, while at the other side of the film was a\r\nmetallic reflecting surface, namely, quicksilver. Supposing a ray of red\r\nlight to enter the glass and traverse the film, it would be reflected\r\nfrom the metallic surface, and would meet the direct ray within the\r\nsubstance of the film, with a difference of length of path that would\r\nproduce the interferences already described, and so give rise to\r\nalternate lines or bands of darkness and brightness. It would, of\r\ncourse, be in the lines of maximum brightness that the silver would be\r\nfirst deposited by the photographic action, and these microscopically\r\nfine lines or striæ of silver would give back, from ordinary light, a\r\ncolour corresponding to the waves of red light that produced them.\r\nSimilarly with the other colours. Anyone may observe the production of\r\ncolour from ordinary white light in the iridescent tints of\r\nmother-of-pearl, where the effects are due to the varying distances of\r\nfine edges of the layers of the substance. If an impression is taken\r\nfrom a piece of mother-of-pearl by solid paraffin, or by white wax, or\r\neven by common red sealing-wax, the colours will seem to be adhering to\r\nthe impression, but the operation may be repeated times without number.\r\nIt is the distance apart of the lines or striæ that determinates the\r\ncolour, and this is always some definite multiple of the wave lengths,\r\ngiven on p. 411, for the various colours. M. Lippmann’s products are\r\ntrue colour photographs, and they form a new and elegant experimental\r\ndemonstration of the doctrine of luminiferous undulations.\r\n\r\nThe colour effects of nature have also been reproduced by taking\r\nphotographs of the same scene through coloured glass. Thus a screen of\r\nyellow glass will intercept the blue and the red rays, and the sensitive\r\nfilm will be impressed with images of objects containing yellow rays\r\nonly, and that in proportion to the quantity of these rays that enter\r\ninto any given tint. Similarly with images taken through red and blue\r\nglasses. The positives from these partial images being projected by\r\nthree optical lanterns on the same space on a screen, and each being\r\ncoloured by passing through tinted glasses like the original, the\r\nsuperposed images thus combined give a very lively impression of the\r\nnatural colours in all their gradations.\r\n\r\nAmong the many processes for reproducing photographs by non-photographic\r\nprocesses, some have been more or less successfully combined with colour\r\nprinting. Some of these productions are very effective, and are more\r\nattractive to many persons than the monochromatic tints of ordinary\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 312.—_Portrait of Aloysius Senefelder._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRINTING PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it is beyond contradiction that printing is one of those inventions\r\nwhich have most influenced the progress of mankind, so it will be\r\nadmitted that certain modern processes, by greatly facilitating the\r\noperations, and vastly extending the resources, of the art, possess an\r\ninterest and importance surpassed by few of the subjects we have\r\ndiscussed. In a former article the reader has been made acquainted with\r\nthe steam printing-press and other applications of machinery by which\r\nthe impressions of a form of type, or of a pattern, can be rapidly\r\nmultiplied. Here we have to describe some ingenious methods of preparing\r\nthe forms or originals for letterpress and other printing, and certain\r\nbeautiful processes for multiplying drawings, engravings, and pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _STEREOTYPING._\r\n\r\nThis term is applied to the process of obtaining the impression of a\r\nform of movable types, or of a woodcut, on a plate of metal which can be\r\nprinted from. These plates, after the required number of copies have\r\nbeen printed, can be stored away; and they are ready for use whenever\r\nanother issue of the work is required. When the pages that are to be\r\nstereotyped have been set up in ordinary type, there are several methods\r\nby which the stereotype plates may be obtained from them; or rather,\r\nthere are several materials used to form the matrix or mould in which\r\nthe metal is cast. When plaster of Paris is used, the form is first\r\nslightly oiled, to prevent adhesion of the plaster; a thin mixture of\r\nplaster and water is then poured upon the form, which is surrounded by a\r\nraised rim, to retain the plaster. The thin plaster is carefully led\r\ninto all the recesses of the type, and then some thicker material is\r\npoured on. The plaster soon sets, and is lifted off the type, and, after\r\ndrying, is ready to receive the molten metal of which the stereotype\r\nplate is formed. This metal is an easily fusible alloy of lead,\r\nantimony, and other metals, which takes the form of the mould with great\r\naccuracy, and is, when solid, sufficiently hard to print from.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313.—_Press for Stereotyping by Clay Process._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother plan is to make use of prepared clay, spread upon an iron plate,\r\nfor the formation of the mould. The face of the type is brushed with\r\nbenzine, the plate with the clay is laid upon it, and pressure is\r\napplied. The whole is then dried in a slow oven, and the clay, when\r\ndetached from the type, is ready to form the mould. The advantages of\r\nthe clay process are that the type does not require to be afterwards\r\ncleaned from oil, and that the material does not fill up the deeper\r\nspaces of the form, so that a thinner stratum of metal suffices to form\r\nthe stereotype plate.\r\n\r\nA third mode of obtaining the mould has been already mentioned in\r\nconnection with the Walter Printing Press (page 313), in the working of\r\nwhich the _papier maché_ process is ingeniously made to supply the\r\ncurved stereotype plates for the cylinders. This process is also largely\r\nused for other newspaper presses, and sometimes for bookwork, as it\r\nforms an invaluable means of expeditiously obtaining a number of\r\nstereotype plates from the movable types. This production of a number of\r\nsimilar forms makes it possible to strike off a very large number of\r\ncopies in a short time, for many presses can be employed simultaneously.\r\nFor the paper process a number of sheets of tissue-paper are pasted\r\ntogether, and the moist paper is laid upon the form; then the operator,\r\nby light strokes of a brush, beats down the paper into the hollows of\r\nthe type, beginning at the centre of the page, and going towards the\r\nmargins. A sheet of stout unsized paper, called “plate paper,”\r\nconstitutes the upper layer; and when the whole has been well beaten\r\ndown upon the type, pressure is applied by means of a screw acting upon\r\na plate of iron covering the whole. In this condition a gentle heat,\r\nproduced by steam, is made to completely dry and harden the paper\r\nmatrix, which is very soon fit to be used for casting the metal. The\r\napparatus for this purpose consists of a hollow iron table, within which\r\nsteam is made to circulate. On this the form is placed, and the platen\r\nis pressed down upon it by means of a screw. In many cases the platen\r\nalso is heated by steam, to accelerate still further the drying of the\r\nmatrix, which is effected in about four or five minutes. One paper\r\nmatrix, by careful use, will serve for the production of a series of\r\ncasts without receiving any damage from the molten metal, as this is\r\nfusible at a low temperature.\r\n\r\nThe mould for casting flat stereotype plates from the paper matrix is\r\nmade of iron, and has parallel surfaces, which admit of being so\r\nadjusted that the thickness required in the plates may be obtained very\r\nnearly. The paper matrix is laid on the horizontal iron bed of the\r\nmould; gauge-bars are adjusted, which retain it in its position; and\r\nthen the second plate is folded down—the distance between that and the\r\npaper being determined by the gauge-bars. The cover is secured by\r\nclamping-screws, and then the mould is turned upright to receive the\r\nmetal, which is removed, when solid, after the mould has been turned\r\nback into its horizontal position.\r\n\r\nHowever the stereotype plates have been produced, it is necessary\r\naccurately to adjust their thickness by planing off some of the material\r\nfrom the back. The edges have also to be cut and trimmed to the exact\r\ndimensions required by the press. Various machines have been devised for\r\neffecting all these operations with accuracy and dispatch. The plates\r\nare afterwards mounted on wooden or metal blocks to bring them to the\r\nheight of ordinary type.\r\n\r\nA fourth method of producing plates for the same purpose as the\r\nstereotype plates already described is by _electrotyping_. This method\r\nappears to have been introduced as early as 1840, but the first results\r\nwere not without imperfections. Now, however, this plan is almost\r\nuniversally applied to bookwork and woodcut illustrations. Many of our\r\npopular illustrated periodicals have so large a circulation that the\r\nwooden blocks would necessarily be spoiled by being used in steam\r\npresses long before they had yielded the required number of impressions;\r\nand the method has also the great advantage of securing the original\r\nengraving from the chance of accidental damage, by which a block is\r\nsometimes irretrievably injured. Hence woodcut illustrations are now\r\nalways printed from electrotype copies of the engraved blocks, whether\r\nthe work itself be printed from movable type or not. But the electrotype\r\nor stereotype process is always resorted to in the case of a work,\r\nwhether illustrated or not, when it is foreseen that a re-issue will be\r\ndemanded. These processes are also of great advantage to the practical\r\nprinter, because when the pages set up in type have received their final\r\ncorrections, he can take the casts, and then the type may be\r\ndistributed—that is, returned to the cases ready for the compositors to\r\nuse for other work.\r\n\r\nThe electrotype process is almost as simple as those for producing\r\nstereotype plates by casting, and its productions excel these by their\r\ngreat durability and extreme exactness of reproduction. We may take it\r\nfor granted that the reader is familiar with the fact that ordinary\r\nletterpress characters and woodcuts are printed from forms, in which the\r\nblack portions are in _relief_. For woodcuts the artist makes the\r\ndrawing, in reversed position, on a block of finely-grained boxwood, in\r\nwhich the fibres of the wood are perpendicular to the surface. The\r\nengraver hollows out all the parts which in the impression remain white,\r\nwhile all the parts which are to receive the ink and produce the black\r\nparts of the impression must be left at the original level. The wooden\r\nblocks thus engraved would serve to produce a certain number of\r\nimpressions, which could be taken off by careful hand-printing without\r\nperceptible damage to the block. But the pressure necessary for printing\r\ninevitably crushes the projecting parts of the block; and the\r\nimpressions, after a certain number, lose their sharpness. This is\r\nespecially the case in machine printing; but not only does the\r\nelectrotype cast present a surface capable of bearing hard usage much\r\nbetter than those of the hardest wood, but even if the number of\r\nimpressions required should wear out the metal plate, it can easily be\r\nreplaced by another cast from the original block.\r\n\r\nThe mould which serves to give the electrotype cast may be made either\r\nof gutta-percha softened by a gentle heat and applied to the wood, or of\r\nwax. In either case a powerful pressure is applied, in order to force\r\nthe yielding substance to take the forms of the engraved block or of the\r\nmetal type. Wax is now generally preferred; the yellow wax used for this\r\npurpose is melted, and poured into a shallow pan; when it has become\r\nsolid, it is sprinkled over with finely-powdered pure blacklead, which\r\nis brushed over the surface, and then the excess is removed by blowing\r\nwith bellows made for the purpose. Thus prepared, the wax is placed over\r\nthe type-form or wooden block in a powerful press, sometimes worked by\r\nhydraulic power; but more frequently a _toggle_ press is employed, in\r\nwhich the pressure is given by a screw and crank-wheel acting on two\r\n_elbow joints_, or _toggles_. For the information of non-mechanical\r\nreaders it may be stated that a “toggle” consists of two bars jointed\r\ntogether, and placed _nearly_ in a straight line: when a pressure is\r\napplied to the joint, tending to bring the rods still more nearly into a\r\nstraight line, their extremities are thrust apart with a great force,\r\nwhich increases indefinitely as the rectilinear position is approached.\r\nIn the electrotyper’s press there are two toggles constructed of very\r\nbroad bars, or rather thick plates, for they have nearly the width of\r\nthe bed of the press. With this machine a very powerful and regular\r\npressure is applied; and the wax in a few minutes takes a sharp\r\nimpression, embracing all the most delicate details of the work, and\r\nbecomes at the same time very hard. The impression, of course, has\r\nhollows corresponding to the projections of the wooden block or\r\ntype-form, and _vice versâ_. The face of the wax mould is now very\r\ncarefully and completely blackleaded, a soft brush being used in the\r\nprocess. It is then placed in the solution of sulphate of copper, and\r\nthe blacklead receives a deposit of copper, in the manner explained in a\r\nformer page (498). In about forty or fifty hours a firm, compact\r\ndeposit, about as thick as the finger-nail, covers the blackleaded\r\nsurface, forming a perfect reproduction of even the most minute details\r\nof the engraved block or letterpress form.\r\n\r\nThe next operation has for its object the removal of the thin shell of\r\ncopper from the wax. This is effected by exposing the mould to a gentle\r\nheat by immersing it in hot water, or by placing it on a hollow iron\r\ntable which is heated by steam. The wax is run off into a proper\r\nreceptacle for future use, and any portion adhering to the copper is\r\nremoved by the action of naphtha or of a solution of potash. The thin\r\ncopper shell is then tinned on the back, and an alloy of lead with some\r\ntin and antimony, forming the _backing metal_, is poured on it, to the\r\ndepth of about one-eighth of an inch. When this has become solid the\r\nbacking is planed, so that the compound plate may have a certain regular\r\nthickness, and that the back surface may be parallel to the face. The\r\nedges are cut by a circular saw and trimmed by machine-tools, and the\r\nplate is rendered perfectly even, and adjusted with the greatest\r\npossible exactness to the required thickness. It is prepared for the\r\npress by being screwed down upon a block of wood of a certain thickness,\r\nso that the face of the plate may have the same height as common type,\r\nthe screws passing through the margin or other hollow parts of the face\r\nof the cast. No more enduring surface than the copper of these\r\nelectrotype casts, backed up by the hard alloy, has yet been discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _LITHOGRAPHY._\r\n\r\nTo Aloysius Senefelder, a musician attached to one of the theatres in\r\nMunich, whose portrait appears at the head of this article, is due the\r\ninvention of the art of lithography. It is said he used to arrange his\r\nmusical compositions on a kind of slates, formed of flakes of the\r\nlimestone which is found in the neighbourhood of Munich. One day a\r\nmemorandum which he had made in this manner happened to fall into a\r\nslop-bucket full of greasy water; on withdrawing the piece of stone, he\r\nnoticed with surprise that the grease had attached itself to the\r\ncharacters, while the rest of the stone remained quite clean. Such an\r\nincident might have happened to each one of a thousand men, and its\r\nsignificance might not be perceived; but it suggested great\r\npossibilities to Senefelder, who, applying himself for some years with\r\ningenuity and perseverance to experiments with the Munich limestone,\r\nbecame, in the year 1800, the inventor of a new art. Though he was no\r\nchemist, and was unskilled in mechanics and in drawing, yet within four\r\nyears from his first observation he had succeeded in finding the proper\r\nmaterials for his crayons and the appropriate acids for acting on the\r\nstone, in contriving a suitable press for taking the impressions, and in\r\nproducing samples of lithographic work in various styles of art. He\r\nendeavoured to keep his processes secret, and having obtained the\r\nexclusive right of exercising his invention in his own country, he\r\nattempted to carry on all the operations himself. Little by little,\r\nhowever, the general nature of the process became known, and although\r\nthe details were jealously concealed, ingenious persons in France and\r\nelsewhere, by force of experiment, succeeded in re-inventing the art for\r\nthemselves, and Senefelder never profited by his invention as he should\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nThe first lithographic press in London was established by Mr. Hullmandel\r\nin 1810. The value of lithography as a means of multiplying works of art\r\nwas soon afterwards proved by the publication of a magnificent series of\r\npicturesque delineations of the quaint architecture of the old towns of\r\nFlanders and Germany, drawn on the stone by Samuel Prout. The late Mr.\r\nJ. D. Harding largely contributed to the popularity of lithography by\r\nthe landscapes which he drew on the stone, and thus placed in the hands\r\nof every one, prints in which all the freedom and force of the artist’s\r\nwork were secured. The French designers excel in fine-art lithography,\r\nand many beautiful productions of their crayons have been published in\r\nevery department of pictorial illustration.\r\n\r\nThe best lithographic stones come from Germany; but for some kinds of\r\nwork stones from other localities are used, on account of their less\r\ncost. Thus, in England, a stone yielded by the white lias formation near\r\nBath has been found to possess the requisite qualities. The stones for\r\nlithography are prepared in much the same way as slabs of marble are\r\npolished; that is to say, by rubbing one slab against another with sand\r\nand water. When the stones have thus been brought to a plane surface,\r\nthey are finished according to the purpose for which they are intended.\r\nIf they are intended to receive written characters, they are polished to\r\na very smooth surface by means of pumice-stone. But if they are to take\r\ndrawings, then a certain uniform grain is given by means of\r\nfinely-sifted sand, the operation being performed in a similar manner to\r\nthat in which the stones are dressed, only pressure is not applied to\r\nthe upper stone. The stones, after being washed and dried, are carefully\r\ncovered on their prepared surfaces with thin paper, and are sent out for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nWhen the stone is employed to reproduce written characters, or drawings\r\nimitating those done with a pen, _lithographic ink_ is made use of with\r\nan ordinary pen, a ruling-pen, a fine brush, or a pen which the\r\nlithographer makes for the occasion out of thin metallic plates. The\r\ncomposition of the ink varies much: the usual ingredients are wax,\r\ngum-mastic, gum-lac, soap, and lampblack. This composition forms a\r\nsolid, which is rubbed down with water to a thick liquid when required\r\nfor use. The characters have, of course, to be written on the stone in a\r\nreversed position, and the lithographer acquires the habit of doing this\r\nwith neatness and dexterity. He is provided with a looking-glass for\r\nviewing his work, in order to see the effect which will be given by the\r\nimpression, for the looking-glass shows the characters in their usual\r\nposition, just as the image of ordinary writing seen in it is reversed,\r\nshowing, in fact, the very appearance the characters present on the\r\nstone. For a drawing, a _lithographic crayon_ is used, made of wax,\r\nsoap, grease, lampblack, and other ingredients. With this the drawing is\r\nmade on the stone exactly as on paper, save the necessary reversals.\r\n\r\nWhen the design has been placed on the stone, a liquid containing nitric\r\nacid and gum is poured over it. This liquid acts on all the parts of the\r\nstone not protected by the ink or crayon: they are thus rendered\r\nincapable of receiving printing-ink, while the protected parts have the\r\nimpression more strongly fixed; for when the stone has been well washed\r\nwith water, and turpentine has afterwards been applied, so that all the\r\nmatter used in marking the design is dissolved away, the seemingly\r\nobliterated characters reappear when—after the stone has been lightly\r\nwiped with a damp sponge—the roller charged with printer’s ink is\r\napplied. The ink is taken up by the stone only at those places which\r\nhave not been acted on by the acid. The impression is obtained by laying\r\na sheet of damp paper on the inked stone and applying pressure by means\r\nof a roller, under which the stone passes. The stone is moistened with\r\nwater after each impression before the inking-roller is again applied.\r\n\r\nThe lithographic stone, like other originals used in printing, is liable\r\nto deteriorate when large numbers of impressions are taken from it. This\r\nwould be a serious drawback in lithography, but for a method of renewing\r\nthe impression, which renders it unnecessary for the artist to retouch\r\nhis work. This is the process of _transferring_, which is practised by\r\nthe aid of a certain kind of paper specially prepared by a coating of\r\npaste. On this a proof is taken from the original drawing on the stone,\r\nand the still moist sheet is then applied to another stone, with the\r\nface downwards, and passed under the press. The effect of the pressure\r\nis to cause the adherence of the layer of paste to the stone; and when\r\nthe paper has been thoroughly wetted at the back, it may be removed,\r\nleaving the paste still adhering to the stone, with the impression\r\nbeneath it. When water is applied, the paste is washed off, while the\r\nink of the impression remains attached to the stone, there reproducing\r\nthe design drawn on the first stone. The transferred design is treated\r\nin exactly the same manner as the original drawing, acid being poured\r\nover the stone, &c., and the impressions obtained by the same method of\r\nsuccessively sponging, inking, and pressing. The transferred drawing may\r\nbe made to yield another transfer, and so on indefinitely; but when a\r\nlarge number of impressions from one design are required, it is usual to\r\nmake at once from the original as many transfers to separate stones as\r\nwill yield the required number of impressions without deterioration. In\r\nthis way as many as 70,000 copies have been taken from a single drawing\r\nwithout their showing any marked difference in the character of the\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nThe transfer process is also applied to place on the stone characters\r\nwhich have been written with a pen in the ordinary manner on prepared\r\npaper. In this way a person’s handwriting is so accurately reproduced in\r\nthe impressions that it is often very difficult to detect the\r\ninterposition of the lithographic stone, and the impression often passes\r\nas the immediate production of the writer’s pen. It is obvious that\r\ndrawings etched with the pen on transfer-paper can be printed from in\r\nthe same manner. And line engravings, which have been originally\r\nproduced by cutting hollow lines on polished plates of copper, can be\r\nprinted lithographically by transferring an impression to the stone. By\r\ntransfer also the impressions of raised types or of woodcuts can be\r\nprinted from the stone when desirable.\r\n\r\nA beautiful and important application of lithography to the reproduction\r\nof pictures in colours has been so successfully carried out that a new\r\nbranch of the art, termed _chromo-lithography_, now gives facsimiles of\r\nwater-colour drawings and of paintings in oil. The copies of\r\nwater-colour drawings especially are remarkable for their artistic\r\nqualities, and it is undeniable that these cheap reproductions of good\r\npaintings have done much to extend the knowledge of art. It is not\r\ncontended that a chromo-lithograph, for example, after one of old\r\nWilliam Hunt’s rustic figures, or birds’ nests with banks of primroses,\r\ncan possess the wonderful refinement of the original; but it will\r\nnevertheless convey much of the artist’s sentiment. Such transcripts of\r\nthe works of our best artists adorn the homes of thousands who have\r\nnever perhaps had the opportunity of even seeing the painter’s original\r\nhandiwork. In many a remote settlement in distant colonies, as in many\r\nan English home, the chromo-lithograph is the brightest of the household\r\nart treasures.\r\n\r\nThe principle of chromo-lithography consists in printing on the same\r\npaper with inks of various colours from different stones successively,\r\nso as to produce, by the juxtaposition and superposition of the various\r\ntints, the effect of a coloured drawing or painting. The artistic\r\neffects of the best chromo-lithographs require a great number of\r\nprintings for their production, in some cases as many as twenty\r\ndifferent stones being employed. The stones and colours for such\r\nproductions require true artists to prepare them, persons who can\r\nthoroughly understand and enter into the spirit of the original work.\r\nThe first operation consists in the preparation of a faithful but\r\nspirited outline of the original, etched on transfer-paper, from which\r\nthe outline is placed on a lithographic stone. This sketch we have\r\ncalled an outline, but it is in reality something more; for it should\r\nsuggest all the markings and limits of tints which belong to the\r\noriginal. This first sketch has some points marked on the margin by dots\r\nor crosses, which serve to secure true register in the subsequent\r\nprocesses; that is, the impressions of the successive tints are so\r\nplaced on the press that these points coincide in each impression.\r\n\r\nFrom the first stone as many impressions of the sketch are transferred\r\nin light ink to other stones as there are colours required in the\r\nreproduction. To each colour a special stone is assigned, on which the\r\nlithographer, guided by the slight impression of the sketch, draws with\r\nthe ordinary black crayon the form which that colour is to produce on\r\nthe paper. Much artistic skill and judgment are required to do this in\r\nsuch a manner as to obtain a clear and harmonious final result. The\r\ngradations of the colours, and their blendings by superposition, must be\r\ncarefully regarded. When the form and limits of each colour have been\r\nskilfully laid down upon its own stone, the surface is acted on by the\r\nacid, it is washed, the ink is dissolved off by turpentine, the stone is\r\nsponged, and the roller charged with ink of the appropriate tint is\r\npassed over it. The ink, as before, adheres only to the parts over which\r\nthe crayon has passed, and an impression may be drawn off. Each of the\r\nother stones is similarly treated, and when the whole are ready, a proof\r\nis taken by giving the same sheet of paper the whole series of\r\nimpressions in their proper order and colours, with the greatest\r\npossible accuracy of register. If any alterations appear desirable, they\r\nare made accordingly, by aid of certain devices which need not be here\r\ndescribed, and when a satisfactory result has been obtained, the\r\nprinting of the whole series of impressions is proceeded with. When the\r\nnumber of these is very large, transfers of each stone are taken as in\r\nordinary lithography, only with certain extra precautions for obtaining\r\nprecision in the register.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant effects produced by using gold and silver in lithography\r\nare obtained by using a kind of varnish, instead of coloured ink, for\r\nprinting those parts where the metal is to appear. When this varnish has\r\nacquired a certain stickiness by partial drying, powdered gold or silver\r\nis applied, and this attaches itself only to the varnish; when the sheet\r\nis dry it is passed under a burnished steel roller, the pressure of\r\nwhich imparts a brilliant lustre to the metal.\r\n\r\nA method of colour-printing, in some respects resembling that of\r\nchromo-lithography, is practised by printing in variously coloured inks\r\nfrom a series of wooden blocks. This admits of far greater expedition in\r\nworking off the impressions than the process with stones. The gradations\r\nof the coloured inks and powdered tints are produced in the same manner\r\nas those of ordinary woodcuts in black and white; and when the colours\r\nare well chosen, and care is taken to secure the accurate superposition\r\nof the impressions, very pleasing effects can be produced by this means.\r\nThe coloured prints which are from time to time issued as supplements to\r\nthe “Illustrated London News” are produced by this process, and are no\r\ndoubt well known to the reader. Our plate of spectra, No. XVII., is an\r\nexample of another method of printing in colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _OTHER PROCESSES._\r\n\r\nIn recent times a great number of printing processes have been devised,\r\nbut only a few have found their way into practical use, and some of\r\nthese have scarcely been so extensively applied as their merits appear\r\nto deserve: either because the public demand has been insufficient to\r\nbring these inventions into common use, or the cost of working them has\r\nbeen too great. There is no doubt of their scientific success, whatever\r\nmay be their commercial value as competing with cheaper and readier\r\nmethods. We shall first describe the plan which has been termed _Nature\r\nPrinting_.\r\n\r\nThis process is applicable only to certain objects which possess, or may\r\nbe made to assume, a flat form. It has been most successfully applied to\r\nbotanical specimens, the impressions of the leaves, flowers, and other\r\nparts of plants being given with an accuracy and minuteness of detail\r\nwhich the finest work of an engraver could never attain. In fact, the\r\nprints may be examined with a microscope, and they then reveal the\r\nminute structure of the object with wonderful clearness and delicacy.\r\nThe notion of nature printing originated with M. Auer, the\r\nSuperintendent of the Imperial Printing Office at Vienna; but the\r\nprocess was introduced into England, with certain improvements, by Mr.\r\nH. Bradbury. Supposing the object to be printed is a plant or the frond\r\nof a fern, it is first thoroughly dried by being pressed between folds\r\nof blotting-paper by means of a screw-press. The paper is changed\r\nseveral times, and, when necessary, the drying is accelerated by a\r\ngentle heat. When the specimen is perfectly dry, it requires very\r\ncareful handling, for it is then generally extremely brittle. It is laid\r\nupon a sheet of pure soft lead, the face of which has been formed into a\r\nperfectly even surface, smooth and bright as a mirror. Mr. Bradbury\r\nencountered some difficulties in attempting to produce a surface of this\r\nkind, for small irregularities of the lead surface showed themselves;\r\nbut Mr. James Wood succeeded in preparing for him a machine by which the\r\nlead is planed and polished in one operation. The object having been\r\ncarefully laid upon the bright and smooth surface of the lead, a\r\npowerful pressure is applied by passing the plate between a pair of\r\npolished steel rollers. The effect of this is to embed the plant in the\r\nsoft metal, which thus receives even the most delicate markings of the\r\nobject. The next operation is the careful and patient removal of the\r\nobject from the plate; and as this is very brittle, it will be easily\r\nunderstood that it does not in general come away entirely, but portions\r\nwill be left embedded in the metal. The skill of the operator is shown\r\nby destroying these by means of a blowpipe-flame, without in the least\r\nfusing the lead, which would of course ruin the impression.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole has been removed, the leaden plate will have been\r\nengraved, as it were, by the object itself; and in this state the plate\r\nwill yield impressions with ink in the same manner as an engraved copper\r\nplate. But in the soft metal the image would soon be obliterated, and\r\ntherefore a facsimile of its impression is obtained in copper by the\r\nelectrotype process. For this end the lead is covered with a varnish,\r\nexcept on the face, and thus the deposit of copper takes place only\r\nwhere it is required, and the current of electricity is continued until\r\na proper thickness of deposit has been obtained. This electrotype has\r\nall the hollow forms of the lead plate in relief, and it is used only\r\nfor the preparation of another electrotype. For this purpose its face is\r\nbrushed over with fine, pure blacklead, in order to prevent the deposit\r\nfrom becoming incorporated with it, while the rest of the plate is\r\nvarnished. When it is placed in the electrotyping solution the copper is\r\ndeposited on the blackleaded face, and the action is continued until the\r\nlayer of metal has acquired the thickness of one-eighth of an inch. It\r\nis then removed from the matrix, and is ready for the printer, who deals\r\nwith it in the ordinary manner of copper-plate printing, except that he\r\nuses a softer paper, and this is forced by the pressure into the\r\ndepressions in the plate, so that the impression is really embossed on\r\nthe paper. Coloured inks are also used instead of black; for instance,\r\nto the leaves green-coloured ink is applied, and to the stems, &c.,\r\nbrown ink.\r\n\r\nSeveral works on certain branches of natural history have been very\r\nappropriately illustrated in this way; among these, perhaps, no more\r\nbeautiful example is to be found than in “The Ferns of Great Britain and\r\nIreland,” with text by Lindley and Moore. The merits of the\r\nnature-printing process appear to be the accuracy of outline in the flat\r\nform, and the delicacy of detail in parts projecting from the surface.\r\nThe impressions cannot present artistic or natural shading in the\r\nobjects; for the depth of colour will be in proportion to the projection\r\nof the part, whereas in nature the darkest shades are seen in the\r\ndeepest recesses.\r\n\r\nA copper plate, cut in the ordinary manner—as a line engraving, for\r\nexample—soon deteriorates, as the pressure applied for each impression\r\ntaken from it tends to close up the lines. It has therefore been\r\nnecessary, where a plate has to yield a large number of impressions, to\r\nmake use of steel instead of copper. But the electrotype has given the\r\nmeans of multiplying indefinitely facsimiles of engraved copper plates,\r\nso that in many cases a number of these are prepared, and used so long\r\nas they continue to yield clear impressions, the original plates\r\nengraved by the artist only furnishing the matrix. The mode of\r\nreproducing the plates by electrotyping from the original engraved\r\nplates is identical with that just described for obtaining the plates\r\nfor nature printing from the leaden plates.\r\n\r\nAnother process of wider interest, and producing very beautiful results,\r\nis known as the Woodbury printing process, from the name of its\r\ninventor. It is a mode of photographically forming a picture in relief,\r\nfrom which printing blocks are obtained in much the same manner as in\r\nthe nature-printing process. But the subject which is thus printed is a\r\nphotograph; and it is only because in the actual production of the\r\nimpression on paper the agency of light is not called into play that it\r\nis not described under the head of photography, for it is an ingenious\r\nmode of causing the photograph to engrave its own image on a metal\r\nplate. It is founded on a fact which has already been noticed, namely,\r\nthe insolubility of gelatine which has been mixed with a bichromate and\r\nexposed to the action of light. Mr. Woodbury has obtained the best\r\nresults with a solution of Nelson’s opaque gelatine, 1 oz. of which is\r\ndissolved in 5 oz. of water, and to each ounce of the solution 15 grains\r\nof ammonium bichromate are added. When a layer of this mixture, which is\r\nof course prepared in the dark, is exposed to the action of light under\r\na negative photograph, the gelatine is rendered insoluble under those\r\nparts of the negative through which the light passes, that is, in the\r\nparts corresponding with the dark shades in the original object, and the\r\ndepth of the layer thus rendered insoluble in each part will depend on\r\nthe relative thickness of the silver deposit in the negative photograph.\r\nThus, in the half-tints the insoluble layer will not be so deep as under\r\nthe parts of the negative through which the light passes without\r\ninterruption. But the differences of depth will appear when the soluble\r\ngelatine has been dissolved away on the side of the layer which is\r\nfarther from the negative. Hence, Mr. Woodbury spreads his layer of\r\nbichromated gelatine on a sheet of plate-glass, previously coated with\r\ncollodion, and when the gelatine has become dry, the double film is\r\ndetached from the glass and exposed under a negative, the collodion side\r\nbeing uppermost and in contact with the photograph. After exposure the\r\nfilm is temporarily attached to another piece of glass, by means of a\r\nsolution of India-rubber, and is then immersed in warm water, which\r\nquickly dissolves the soluble parts of the gelatine. Thus a counterpart\r\nin relief of the photograph is obtained. This is allowed to dry, and the\r\nnext operation consists in obtaining an impression from it in metal:\r\nthis Mr. Woodbury at first obtained by electric deposition, but he has\r\ndiscovered a much more expeditious process, which one would hardly have\r\nsupposed possible before actual trial. The dry hard gelatine is placed\r\nupon a flat, truly-surfaced steel plate, with the collodion surface\r\ndownward, a plate of soft metal is placed upon the gelatine, and the\r\nwhole is subjected to a pressure of about four tons per square inch in a\r\nhydraulic press. In one minute a perfect impression of the gelatine\r\nrelief, down to the smallest detail, is formed in the soft metal; and,\r\nstrangely enough, the delicate sculpture which the light has executed on\r\nthe gelatine is not in the least injured, but will stamp its image on an\r\nindefinite number of metal plates in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe reader will understand that the impressed plate of metal now bears a\r\nhollow sculpture representing the image of the original object from\r\nwhich the negative photograph was taken, the darkest shades of the\r\nobject being represented by the deepest depressions in the plate, while\r\nthe highest lights are represented by portions of the metal at the\r\nlevel, or nearly so, of the surface of the plate. From this plate the\r\nprints on paper are obtained as follows: The plate is placed\r\nhorizontally, with its impressed face upwards, and a quantity of a\r\ncertain kind of ink is placed upon it. The composition of this ink, if\r\nink it may be termed, is one of the ingenious parts of this elegant\r\nprocess. It is made of gelatine, coloured with some suitable transparent\r\nor semi-transparent pigments, and it is poured on the plate in a warm\r\nand fluid state, and in quantity more than sufficient to fill all the\r\nhollows. A sheet of paper is placed over the plate, and a moderate\r\npressure is applied, when the excess of ink is squeezed out and escapes.\r\nThat which remains in the hollows of the plate, becoming set by cooling,\r\nadheres to and is removed with the paper, giving in each part a force of\r\ntint proportional to its quantity, that is, according to the depth of\r\nthe hollow in the plate. The paper is laid aside to dry, and although\r\nthe picture has at first a certain relief, yet the gelatine ink dries\r\ndown, the picture becoming so flat that no difference of the surface is\r\nperceptible. It will be observed that this mode of printing rests upon a\r\ndistinctly new principle—namely, the production of shades and gradations\r\nof tints by the varying quantity of the ink laid upon the different\r\nparts of the paper. The method is in this respect identical with that by\r\nwhich the water-colour painter produces his gradations; for the colour\r\nis applied in transparent layers, and the depth of the tint produced\r\ndepends upon the mass of the pigment laid on, and is greater or less\r\naccording as the white of the paper is more or less visible through the\r\nfilm of colouring matter. The gradations of tint in wood and steel\r\nengraving and in lithographs are dependent upon quite another\r\nprinciple—namely, the varying distribution of spots, patches, or lines\r\nin black ink of uniform intensity. The Woodbury print has all the detail\r\nand clearness of the photograph, together with a certain softness,\r\nproduced by the transparency of the colouring matter, not found in the\r\nordinary photographic print. The method admits of any desired tint being\r\ngiven to the prints, and these are perfectly unchangeable by light. Thus\r\nthe result is a print which secures every good quality of a photograph\r\nwithout any of the unpleasant ones, such as hardness, harsh tints,\r\nopacity, fugaciousness. The prints may be taken on plates of glass, and\r\nthey then form beautiful transparencies. Such prints constitute most\r\nadmirable slides for the magic lantern, since the semi-transparent\r\ncolouring matter, and the soft gradations, produce charming effects.\r\n\r\nAnother ingenious invention of Mr. Woodbury’s provides a means of making\r\nthe sunbeam engrave a mezzotint copper plate from a photograph. The\r\naction of light on bichromated gelatine is here again taken advantage\r\nof. A film is prepared similar to that used in the above-described\r\nWoodbury process proper, but the gelatine is mixed with some powdered or\r\ngranular material, so that it may give rise to a granulated texture in\r\nthe resulting plate. This film is treated exactly in the same way as\r\nbefore with regard to exposing, washing with warm water, drying, &c. The\r\nproduct is a very thin sheet, having a mezzotint-like surface, with more\r\nor less grain according to the action of the light. The white parts are\r\nperfectly freed from the granular matter by the solution of the\r\ngelatine, while in the darkest parts there is the greatest accumulation.\r\nThe dry film in this condition is pressed into soft metal, and by a\r\ndouble process of electrotyping and subsequent facing with steel, a\r\nplate is obtained fit for printing at the copper-plate press. The firm\r\nof Messrs. Goupil and Co., of Paris, extensively employ this process for\r\nthe preparation of the illustrations in that elegant publication, “The\r\nPortfolio.” Another method of photographic engraving lately projected by\r\nMr. Woodbury is the following: a plate of steel is covered with a layer\r\nof gelatine, mixed with a certain proportion of gum and glucose, and\r\ndried in a dark room. This is exposed to the action of light under a\r\ntransparent photograph on glass. When afterwards this gelatine layer is\r\nbreathed upon, the moisture attaches itself to the portions which have\r\nnot been acted on by the light, and these become more or less sticky.\r\nSand or emery sifted to three different degrees of fineness is then\r\nsprinkled over the plate, beginning with the coarsest, which attaches\r\nitself to the most sticky parts. The less sticky parts are incapable of\r\nretaining these larger particles; while the finest sand, which is\r\nsprinkled on last, is held by parts of the plate that are even very\r\nslightly sticky; but the places where the light has been intense are\r\ndry, and none of the sand adheres. The gelatine layer is then completely\r\ndried, and the plate, being covered with another of soft metal, is\r\nplaced in a press, by which a granular impression is produced on the\r\nsoft metal, and this may then be copied in copper by the electrotype\r\nprocess. The larger particles of sand produce deeper depressions in the\r\nplate, and thus a gradation of tint is obtained.\r\n\r\nAmongst other applications of the gelatine relief devised by Mr.\r\nWoodbury is that of producing a watermark in paper. A very delicate\r\nrelief is firmly attached to a plate of steel or zinc, and when paper is\r\nrolled in contact with these plates, it receives an impression of the\r\ndesign, all the delicate half-tints being represented in the slight\r\nopacity of the paper. Mr. Woodbury is at present engaged in perfecting a\r\nmethod for wedding his own process to that of chromo-lithography, by\r\nfirst printing the different tints on the paper, and then transferring\r\nthe Woodbury prints to the top of the colours. The transparency of the\r\ngelatine and ink is such that the most brilliant effects are attainable\r\nin this way.\r\n\r\nBichromated gelatine is also the agent employed in _photolithography_,\r\nthe image of a negative photograph being thus rendered insoluble in a\r\nlayer of gelatine spread on the stone, which is acted on by acids, &c.,\r\nin the usual way, after the soluble portions have been removed by water.\r\nAs there are also methods of using the lithographic process with plates\r\nof zinc instead of stones, so there are processes of impressing the\r\nimage photographically upon the zinc. Of the general nature of the\r\nprocesses of _zincography_, _photolithography_, and _photozincography_\r\nthe reader will now probably be able to form some idea, but the details\r\nneed not here be described. The last two, and some other processes for\r\nprinting photographic effects mechanically, all labour under the defect\r\nof imperfectly rendering the _half-tints_ of a picture. This remark does\r\nnot apply to the Woodbury process. The photo-lithographic process gives\r\nmarvellous results in cases where no gradations are required. Thus a\r\nwhole page of the _Times_ newspaper may be lithographed in a space not\r\nexceeding half of this page, and although the characters may be\r\nindistinguishable to the naked eye, a lens will show them perfectly.\r\nSimilarly, we may obtain within the compass of an octavo page a\r\nphoto-lithograph of one of Hogarth’s large engravings, which will show\r\nevery touch of the original artist’s _burin_.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to hope that the time is not far distant when all our\r\ntedious mechanical methods of reproducing drawings by wood or steel\r\nengravings will be superseded by processes which will give us absolute\r\nfacsimiles of every touch of the artist’s pencil; and when some process,\r\ngiving all the delicacy and truthfulness of Mr. Woodbury’s prints, will\r\nsupply us with faithful transcripts of nature for book illustration at a\r\ncost not exceeding that of the ordinary methods. So far as relates to\r\none style of drawing, these requirements appear to be nearly realized in\r\nthe process termed the _graphotype_, which reproduces mechanically, in\r\nthe form of a metal plate with all the lines in relief, a design which\r\nthe artist has etched on a flat surface. This is effected in the\r\nfollowing manner: Chalk is powdered very finely, and sifted through wire\r\ngauze having very narrow meshes. A quantity of this is spread upon a\r\nsmooth plate of metal, and subjected to an intense pressure by means of\r\nan hydraulic press. The particles of the chalk cohere into a mass,\r\nhaving sufficient firmness to admit of its surface being drawn upon in\r\nthe same manner as a block of boxwood. The drawing is effected with an\r\nink composed of lampblack and glue, a finely-pointed camel’s-hair brush\r\nbeing employed; but the shades must be produced by lines and strokes as\r\nin wood engraving. When the ink is quite dry, the surface is rubbed with\r\na fitch brush or with velvet; and by this brushing the particles of\r\nchalk not protected by the inked strokes are loosened and carried off.\r\nIn a short time the chalk between the strokes becomes quite hollowed\r\nout; and when a depth of about one-eighth of an inch has been attained,\r\nevery line remains standing in relief exactly as in an engraved wood\r\nblock. A strong solution of silicate of potash is then poured upon the\r\nchalk, which its chemical action converts into a kind of stone without\r\nin any way altering the forms. Although this artificial stone is quite\r\nhard, so that impressions may at once be taken from it, yet it is\r\nincapable of enduring the wear and tear of the printing-press.\r\nAccordingly a mould is taken from it, and this is made, by some of the\r\nprocesses of casting or electrotyping already described, to furnish a\r\nmetal stereotype plate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _THE LINOTYPE MACHINE._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_a_.—_The Linotype Machine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong recent inventions in connection with printing, the _linotype\r\nmachine_ calls for special mention. In this machine a great number of\r\nactions are combined and co-ordinated with the utmost ingenuity, but\r\nsuch mechanism does not lend itself to popular description, and we must\r\nconfine ourselves to a statement of what it effects, recommending the\r\nreader to avail himself of some opportunity of seeing the apparatus at\r\nwork. It will not then be needful to give details of every one of the\r\nvery numerous parts, which present in the _ensemble_ a great appearance\r\nof complication, the more so that much ingenuity has been exerted to\r\nmake the machine compact, which is a practical point of great\r\nimportance. The disposition of parts is not, therefore, that which is\r\ncalculated to show each movement clearly to the spectator, but that by\r\nwhich the least space is occupied. The machine is driven by belting from\r\na main shaft, turned by a steam-engine, gas-engine, electro-motor, or\r\nother regular source of power, and rotated at such a rate that the main\r\npulley of the machine itself (14½ inches in diameter) shall make about\r\n60 revolutions per minute. Fig. 313_a_ shows the general aspect of the\r\nmachine and seat for the one operator required, but as we are not\r\nundertaking a detailed and complete description of the whole mechanism,\r\nno letters of reference are given; but the reader will be able, from the\r\nfollowing diagrams, to identify the more important parts, and form a\r\ngeneral idea of their action and purpose. In this machine great use is\r\nmade of the contrivances called _cams_, several of which may be observed\r\nin the sketch towards the side of the machine on the left, being fixed\r\non and turning with its main shaft. They consist of plates, or open rims\r\nof various forms, which move levers, etc., in any required way, and at\r\nany required period of the revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_b_.—_A Matrix._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_c_.—_Diagram of Movements._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_d_.—_A Line of Matrices._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe linotype is not a type-setting and type-distributing machine, but\r\none in which the form is stereotyped line by line; hence its name of\r\n_linotype_. The mould, or matrix, is made up of a number of brass\r\nmatrices, each of which consists of a flat plate having on its edge a\r\nletter incised. One of these is represented on Fig. 313_b_ wherein _a_\r\nis the hollow letter. At the upper end the plate is cut into a number of\r\nnotches like the teeth of a saw, only that some of the teeth have their\r\npoints cut off, leaving steps, as it were, with faces parallel to the\r\nlonger edges of the matrix. There may be seen one of these at _b_, and\r\non the opposite side of the V-shape, three may be observed. The number\r\nand arrangement of the cut-away notches is different for the matrix of\r\neach letter (or sign), and special to it. The meaning of this will be\r\nseen presently. The diagram Fig. 313_c_ will help us to see how these\r\nmatrices are assembled by touches of the finger on the required letters\r\nas marked on the keyboard at D. The matrices are assorted and stored in\r\nseparate channels in the “matrix” magazine, A, a portion of its cover\r\nbeing here represented as broken off in order to show the channels. It\r\nwill readily be understood that, by a system of levers connected with\r\neach key, the corresponding matrix is released by means of an escapement\r\n(B´), and falls down one of the channels E on to the travelling belt F,\r\nwhich conveys it to composing stick G, in which the matrices\r\nsuccessively assemble in the order to constitute a line (Fig. 313_c_),\r\nin which observe that the several words are separated by spaces formed\r\nby long wedges of steel, the thick ends of which hang down considerably\r\nbelow the line of matrices. These are dropped one by one from a store at\r\nI (Fig. 313_c_), when required, by a touch on the key-bar J; two of them\r\nare shown in position in the assembling stick G. In Fig. 313_a_ a bell\r\nis seen in front of the keyboard, and this is automatically rung by a\r\nmechanical device when the line of matrices is approaching in length to\r\nthat allotted to the work. At this point the operator has to consider\r\nwhether he can complete the line with another, or with how many\r\nsyllables of a word, and he touches the keys of the required letters.\r\nThe assembling stick then contains all the matrices comparatively\r\nloosely packed side by side, for the words are as yet separated by only\r\nthe thin edges of the space wedges. A touch of the operator on a lever\r\nbrings into play another part of the mechanism by which the composed\r\nline is bodily lifted a short way, then moved horizontally, and conveyed\r\nto the “mould wheel,” in which there is a slot, adjustable in length and\r\nwidth, and the line is here firmly pressed against the face of the wheel\r\nin such a way that the slot coincides with the line of hollow letters on\r\nthe edges of the matrices, as shown in Fig. 313_b_. This moulding\r\narrangement is not the least ingenious device in this machine, and well\r\ndeserves attention. Before the moulding takes place, but while the line\r\nis in its place, the wedge spaces are pushed up through the matrices by\r\nanother portion of the mechanism, and thus the line is immediately\r\n“justified,” as the printers term it; that is, the wedges rise up,\r\nseparating the words, more or less, until the line has exactly its\r\nassigned length, and the words are, at the same time, separated by equal\r\nspaces. A melting-pot behind the mould-wheel contains a quantity of\r\nfusible metal, resembling stereotype metal, which is maintained at just\r\nthe temperature of fluidity by a regulated gas burner. At the right\r\nmoment a plunger is forced into the fluid mass, causing it to rise\r\nthrough a kind of spout to the level of the slot in the wheel, and be\r\nforced through that into the line of letters. The metal instantly\r\nsolidifies in the mould, the line of matrices is removed on a bar to a\r\nnew position at R, Fig. 313_c_, and the wheel then makes a quarter of a\r\nturn, bringing the mould from the horizontal into a vertical position\r\n(Fig. 313_e_). The linotype is subjected to the operation of certain\r\nknives (not shown), by which it is pared smoothly to the exact thickness\r\nand height required, and finally ejected, as shown in Fig. 313_e_,\r\ndropping in its proper order into a receiving galley. The line, as\r\ncompleted, has the shape represented in Fig. 313_g_, and a number of\r\nthese lines assembled constitute a “form,” answering all the purposes of\r\nthe ordinary forms consisting of separate type. These last, after having\r\nserved their purpose, must be “distributed,” that is, each single letter\r\nmust be returned to the case from which it was taken by the compositor;\r\nbut the linotype form, after use, is simply returned to the melting-pot\r\nfor its metal to be recast into new forms. The forms can, of course,\r\nremain standing for any length of time at the mere expense of keeping\r\nthe metal unemployed. One advantage of the linotype is that the printing\r\nis all done from new clean-faced forms, instead of the old and\r\ndull-faced characters of ordinary type that have been much used, but\r\nhave to be resorted to under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_e_.—_A Finished Line entering Galley._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_f_.—_The Melting Pot and Mould Wheel._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt may occur to the reader that errors in linotype would be much more\r\ndifficult of correction than those occurring with the ordinary type\r\ncomposed by hand. If by chance a wrong matrix appears in the line, this\r\ncan be changed by hand at once; but supposing that the operator\r\noverlooks some error in reading the assembled line, which, observe, he\r\nreads with the characters arranged as they will appear in the\r\nimpression, or that he has misread his manuscript, and the line is cast,\r\nassembled into a “form” with the rest, and then in the printed proof the\r\nerror is discovered, how is it to be rectified? Simply by removing the\r\nfaulty linotype from the form, and casting a new one. This is so quickly\r\nand easily done that it has been found by actual test between linotype\r\nand ordinary type matter containing the same defects, that the former\r\ncould be corrected in less than one-third of the time required for the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nWe left the line of matrices at R (Fig. 313_c_), and we must now\r\nindicate the method by which each is automatically returned to its own\r\nmagazine, an operation for which much ingenious mechanism has been\r\ncontrived, of which the details cannot be well described in this place.\r\nThe line having reached R, the space wedges are disengaged from it and\r\nremoved to their receptacle at I, while the matrices become engaged by\r\ntheir teeth in the grooves of a horizontal bar, and then the bar is\r\ngrasped by a lever which lifts it up to the distributing arrangement at\r\nthe top of the machine, where the teeth of the matrices come to the\r\nexact level of the grooves of the distributor bar T. The line is then\r\npushed laterally, the sides of the matrices become engaged in the\r\nhollows of two parallel screws U, by which, while suspended only by such\r\nof their inclined teeth as the corresponding groove of the distributor\r\ncan support, they are made to slowly travel along from left to right\r\nuntil each reaches a certain point, namely, that at which its sustaining\r\nV grooves on the bar are interrupted by cuts which permit it to drop\r\ninto its own special magazine. A little consideration will show how, by\r\nvarious combinations of the notches on the matrix, and corresponding\r\ncuts at the right places in the grooves of the bar, each matrix may be\r\nmade to move along until it reaches a determinate place, and there\r\ndropped. Compare Fig. 313_b_ and Fig. 313_i_. Each matrix thus again\r\ndeposited in its proper magazine has completed the circuit of the\r\nmachine, or, at least, has passed from the bottom of its magazine to the\r\nassembling stick, hence to the mould, and, by the distributor, finds its\r\nway back to the top of its magazine, whence, in its turn, it will\r\ndescend to perform again the same duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_g_.—_The Finished Line._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_h_.—_Lines assembled into a “Form.”_\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that, beyond the operator’s touches on the\r\nkey-board, and that required to send off the assembled line to the\r\nmoulding apparatus, all the actions are done automatically without the\r\ninterference of the operator, who, while one line is getting moulded,\r\nraised up, and distributed, calmly proceeds with the composition of the\r\nfollowing one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 313_i_.—_Matrices dropping into Magazine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe rate at which the work is produced is very great. One good operator\r\nwith one machine can, it is said, turn out, hour by hour, matter that\r\nwould be equivalent to two and a half pages of this book, arranged solid\r\nor without break. There are, of course, record performances of\r\nexceptional operators who have completed more than twice as much as this\r\nin a single hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 314.—_Recording Anemometer._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RECORDING INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, in enumerating at the close of his inestimable\r\n“Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy” the causes of the rapid\r\ndevelopment of the physical sciences in modern times, assigns a\r\nprominent place to the improvement of scientific apparatus, especially\r\nof those instruments by which exact measurements or observations are\r\nmade. The accurate and elaborate instruments which serve for the\r\ndelicate and precise determinations and observations of modern science\r\nrequire for their production a very advanced state of mechanical art,\r\nsuch as is indicated by the perfection of the tools we described in a\r\nformer article; and these tools are themselves, on the other hand, the\r\noutcome of accurate knowledge, and another proof of the interaction\r\nbetween science and practical art. Since precise observations and\r\naccurate measurements form the essential bases of every science, its\r\nprogress will be accelerated by every improvement in its instruments\r\nwhich increases their delicacy and exactness. Indeed, hardly any branch\r\nof knowledge becomes entitled to be called a science until it rests upon\r\nquantitative data of some kind. Chemistry was nothing but a confused\r\ncollection of vague notions until the exact determinations of the\r\nbalance were employed, and the proportions of the substances combining\r\nor separating in chemical actions were found to be related by certain\r\nsimple and very definite laws. In all branches of inquiry there is the\r\nsame necessity of quantitative comparisons: lengths, angles, surfaces,\r\nvolumes, masses, durations must be compared with standards of their own\r\nkind; motions, forces, pressures, temperatures, lights must be measured.\r\nThe case of chemistry shows the line along which other sciences are\r\nadvancing. Physiology has made great strides since instruments of\r\nprecision have been used in its investigations, and as some of these are\r\nof the kind we here propose to treat of, they will be described in the\r\nsequel. To recording instruments, meteorology is also largely indebted\r\nfor the remarkable progress which it is making, and which will soon\r\nplace this branch of knowledge in a condition to supply the most\r\nstriking illustration of the difference between a science founded on\r\naccurate measurements and a mass of vague observations.\r\n\r\nThe obvious advantage of a recording instrument (say, for example, such\r\na one as that represented in Fig. 314, which registers the force and\r\ndirection of the wind) is that the results are obtained without the\r\nimmediate attention of an observer, and they can be continuously\r\nrecorded at every instant, day and night; but there is another and yet\r\ngreater advantage in certain kinds of instruments which write their own\r\nrecords, in the fact that they can be made to register results which\r\nwould altogether escape direct observation. It is said that a practised\r\nastronomical observer will correctly record the time of a phenomenon to\r\nnearly the tenth of a second; but there are cases in which we may desire\r\nto estimate time to the thousandth part of a second or less. An\r\ninvestigation of M. Foucault has already been named in which a far less\r\ninterval of time was concerned (page 387); but the recording instruments\r\nwe have to mention here are of use for enabling us to make certain\r\ninstantaneous actions mark the time of their occurrence with the\r\ngreatest precision, and also for enabling us to note the variations in\r\nactions which are too rapid to be directly observed in their various\r\nphases.\r\n\r\nFig. 315 is a diagram which will serve to explain the method in which\r\nthe height of the barometer and the thermometer are registered in the\r\ningenious _metereograph_, invented by Professor Hough, of Dudley\r\nObservatory. The contrivance has the advantage of performing the\r\noperation for both instruments, with a single piece of mechanism and on\r\nthe same sheet of paper. The diagram is not intended to indicate the\r\nactual arrangement of the parts of the apparatus, but merely to explain\r\nthe principle of its action. Let A represent a cylinder about 6 in. in\r\ndiameter and 7 in. high, covered with a sheet of paper, ruled with\r\ncertain lines, some parallel to the axis, and others perpendicular to\r\nthose. This drum revolves by clockwork, controlled by a pendulum, at a\r\ncertain regular rate of, say, one turn in seven days. B is a metallic\r\nbar or lever, about 2 ft. in length, mounted on an axis or fulcrum at C.\r\nAt D is a pencil or style projecting from the extremity of the bar\r\nopposite the centre of the drum, but not in actual contact with the\r\npaper. E and F are platinum wires attached to the lever at about 3 in.\r\ndistance from the fulcrum, C; E passes into the open tube of a mercurial\r\nthermometer, G, and F into the shorter branch of a syphon barometer, H.\r\nThe clockwork has other offices to perform besides turning the drum, A,\r\non its axis; and one of these is to alternately elevate and depress the\r\nlever, B, every half-hour. If the end, F, be depressed, it is plain that\r\nthe wire will come into contact with the metallic float, which is\r\nsupported by the mercury and follows its movements. If, therefore, wires\r\nfrom a battery, K, including an electro-magnet, I, in their circuit, be\r\nconnected with the bar at C, and with the mercury at H, when the wire at\r\nF touches the float, the current will pass and the armature of the\r\nelectro-magnet will be attracted. The movement of the armature is so\r\narranged that it causes a blow to be given to the end of the bar D, so\r\nthat the pen there marks a dot on the drum, thus indicating its height\r\nat the time, and therefore that of the mercury in H. When the lever is\r\ndepressed at the other end, the wire, E, similarly completes the circuit\r\nthrough the mercury in the thermometer, and the height of the latter can\r\nbe known from the dot which is similarly impressed on the lower part of\r\nthe paper. These movements may be made with almost any degree of\r\nprecision required. The clockwork is also made to raise the hammers\r\nwhich strike the pen against the drum, at the instant the electric\r\ncurrent passes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 315.—_Registration of Height of Barometer and Thermometer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe instrument, as actually constructed, registers also the height of a\r\nwet-bulb thermometer, by another wire requiring a lower depression of\r\nthe lever to bring it into contact with the mercury in a wet-bulb\r\nthermometer. A complete double motion of the lever requires one hour,\r\nand in that interval the heights of the barometer and both thermometers\r\nare each recorded once. The wet and dry-bulb thermometers are registered\r\nwithin a minute of each other, and half an hour elapses between the\r\nbarometer and thermometer records.\r\n\r\nAnother invention of Professor Hough’s is a barometer which marks a\r\ncontinuous pencil-line on a revolving cylinder, by which the variations\r\nof the mercury are shown for every instant of the day. Another part of\r\nthe arrangement is a machine for automatically printing on paper in\r\nordinary characters the height of the mercury to the thousandth part of\r\nan inch.\r\n\r\nA very simple and trustworthy record of thermometric and barometric\r\nheights is obtained by photography at Kew and elsewhere. A sheet of\r\nsensitive paper passes horizontally at a uniform speed behind the tube\r\nof the instrument, so that the only light it can receive must pass\r\nthrough the glass. A lamp is placed in front, and a portion of the paper\r\nis protected from its rays by the mercury, while those which pass\r\nthrough the tube above the mercury make their impression on the paper,\r\nand thus record the indications of the instrument.\r\n\r\nFig. 314 represents part of another ingenious meteorological instrument\r\ninvented by Mr. J. E. H. Gordon, and made by Mr. Apps. It is an\r\nelectrical anemometer, for indicating and registering the direction and\r\nforce of the wind. The apparatus consists of an external portion, which\r\nis of course fixed on some high and exposed part of the building; and\r\nthe indicating and registering instrument, which communicates with the\r\nformer only by insulated wires connected with a galvanic battery, and\r\nwhich may be placed on any convenient table within the house. The\r\nregistering apparatus in this instrument is very neat and compact, and\r\nthe reader will no doubt be able to form a sufficiently good idea of its\r\nnature from the portion which is visible in the cut, and from the\r\nknowledge of similar apparatus he may have derived from the descriptions\r\nalready given in the article on the electric telegraph.\r\n\r\nModes of making phenomena record the time and duration of their own\r\noccurrence are now much used in all scientific investigations; and in\r\nconnection with the electric _chronograph_ or _chronoscope_ which we are\r\nabout to describe, few more efficient or elegant methods of\r\n“interrogating nature”—to use Bacon’s phrase—have yet been devised. The\r\nreader who has never seen an instrument of this kind will be the better\r\nable to understand its principle by a simple illustration, which may\r\nvery easily be made a practical one by himself if he has a tuning-fork\r\nat hand. Let him fix the tuning-fork firmly into a board in an upright\r\nposition, by inserting the part usually held in the hand into a hole in\r\nthe board; and then attach to the fork, by means of a little bees’-wax,\r\na short bristle, which is to project from the extremity of one prong in\r\na direction perpendicular to the plane in which the prongs vibrate. He\r\nhas now only to provide himself with a piece of glass a few inches\r\nsquare in order to obtain a record of the vibrations of the fork when\r\nsounding. By the help of another piece of board it will be easy to\r\narrange a guide by which the piece of glass can be made to fall down by\r\nits own weight in a plane parallel to the prongs, and in such a manner\r\nthat the free end of the bristle shall just touch its surface during the\r\nwhole time of its descent. Now let the surface of the glass be blackened\r\nin the flame of a candle. If the glass be allowed to slide down when the\r\nfork is not vibrating, the end of the bristle, by removing the lampblack\r\nfrom the surface as the glass falls, would trace out a vertical line.\r\nIf, on the other hand, the blackened surface were itself not moved, but\r\nsimply brought into contact with the end of the bristle, while the fork\r\nwas sounding, there would be marked only a very short horizontal line,\r\ncorresponding with the extent of the vibratory movements of the prong.\r\nWhen the glass is allowed to fall while the prong is in motion, the\r\ncombination of the horizontal movements of the bristle, and the vertical\r\none of the glass, will produce a waved line, which will exhibit\r\nperfectly regular curves if the glass has been moved with uniform\r\nvelocity. It is plain that if the time taken by the glass to pass in\r\nfront of the bristle were accurately known, the number of movements per\r\nsecond executed by the prong of the fork could be found. On the other\r\nhand, if the rate of vibration of the fork be known, the time occupied\r\nin the passage of the glass may accurately be read off. If this simple\r\nexperiment be understood, the principle of the electric chronograph will\r\nbe clear. Substitute for the sliding glass a cylinder covered with white\r\nglazed paper which has been coated with lampblack in the same manner;\r\nsuppose the cylinder to revolve at a uniform rate, while a tuning-fork\r\nis similarly writing its vibrations on the surface of the paper, and let\r\nthe same mechanism which turns the cylinder, slowly draw the\r\nsounding-fork along a straight slide parallel to the axis of the\r\ncylinder. The waved line will not form a complete circle on the surface\r\nof the cylinder, but will be traced out in a spiral, owing to the\r\ncombined motions of the fork and the cylinder. As the number of\r\nmovements per second of a vibrating body emitting a given note are\r\naccurately determined and perfectly regular, the waved line on the\r\ncylinder thus furnishes an exact measure of small intervals of time, the\r\nutility of which will presently be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 316.—_The Electric Chronograph._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 316 represents the apparatus as actually constructed. A is the\r\ncylinder covered with the blackened paper, and driven by clockwork\r\ncontained in the case, B, the rate of movement being regulated by the\r\nconical pendulum at C, so as to be approximately uniform. D is a lever\r\nfor starting and stopping the movement. The clockwork also causes the\r\ncarriage, E, to slide along the bars, F. This carriage bears three\r\nelectro-magnets, and to the armature of each a fine pointed strip of\r\nmetal is attached so as just to touch the surface of the cylinder. The\r\nmovement of the armatures takes place in a direction parallel to the\r\naxis of the cylinder, and they are acted on by independent currents,\r\neach electro-magnet having its own binding-screws for the attachment of\r\nwires. The armature of one of these is a steel bar, which vibrates in\r\nthe manner of the prong of a tuning-fork, at a rate known by the note it\r\ngives out. Sometimes, for delicate experiments, the movements of this\r\narmature are checked and controlled by introducing into its electric\r\ncircuit a contact-breaker, formed of a real tuning-fork, the vibrations\r\nof which are maintained by electro-magnets. Another electro-magnet on\r\nthe carriage, E, can be connected with the pendulum of a standard clock,\r\nso that seconds may be also marked on the cylinder, as larger units in\r\nthe division of the time. In an electric chronograph, which was\r\nexhibited at the International Exhibition of 1862, an ingenious and\r\nexcellent mode of making and breaking the electric contacts from the\r\nstandard pendulum was adopted. Two short vertical glass tubes, placed\r\nside by side, had each near its lower end a small horizontal branch;\r\nthese branches were placed in a line with each other, with their ends in\r\nvery close proximity. The larger tubes were filled with mercury which\r\nflowed into the horizontal branches, and the two streams joined in the\r\nnarrow space between the ends of the tubes. Although the mercury was\r\nhere unsupported by the glass, and surrounded by air only, it did not\r\nrun down, for the space was so small that the cohesion of the mercury\r\nitself sufficed to keep the drop hanging between the two open ends of\r\nthe tubes. A very thin sheet of mica was carried by an arm of the\r\npendulum, so placed that at each complete oscillation the mica entered\r\nthe space between the two tubes and divided the mercury, and thus all\r\nelectrical communication between the two reservoirs was cut off. The\r\nmica remained during one beat of the pendulum in this position; and at\r\nthe commencement of the return beat was withdrawn, allowing the divided\r\ncolumns of mercury to flow together again, and complete the electric\r\ncircuit. This admirable make-and-break arrangement acted with the\r\ngreatest regularity: the mercury was not spilt, as might have been\r\nexpected, there was no friction, and any oxide formed by the spark which\r\npassed when the current was interrupted was removed by the mica. The\r\npendulum provided with such an arrangement allows the current to pass,\r\nand interrupts it, during alternate seconds, and the result is that the\r\ncylinder is marked with a regularly divided broken line, thus,\r\n¯|_|¯|_|¯|_, the establishment and interruption of the current at the\r\nend of each second being marked with great sharpness and precision.\r\n\r\nThe third electro-magnet of the apparatus represented in Fig. 316 is\r\nacted on by currents through the wires, G, H. The point attached to its\r\narmature traces a plain spiral line on the revolving cylinder, except at\r\nthe instant when the current is established or interrupted. And the\r\nphenomenon to be timed is in some way made to accomplish the making and\r\nbreaking of this circuit. This may be perhaps better understood by an\r\nexample. It has sometimes happened that the boxes employed in the\r\npneumatic dispatch stick fast in the tubes, and resist all efforts to\r\ndislodge them by manœuvres with the compressed or rarefied air, or other\r\nmeans. In such a case it becomes necessary to ascertain with tolerable\r\naccuracy the position of the obstruction, so that the tube may be cut at\r\nthe right place and the obstacle removed. The known velocity of sound\r\nhas been ingeniously used for this purpose; the electric chronograph\r\nbeing made the means of ascertaining, to a small fraction of a second,\r\nthe time required for the report of a pistol to be propagated through\r\nthe air of the tube and reflected back from the obstruction. An elastic\r\nmembrane is spread over the open extremity of the pneumatic tube; this\r\nmembrane has in the centre a little disc of platinum, in electric\r\nconnection with one of the wires, G, H. The other wire passes to a\r\ngalvanic cell or battery, and the return wire from the battery is\r\nconnected with a platinum point, the distance of which from the disc can\r\nbe adjusted with nicety by means of a screw, so that the circuit may be\r\ncomplete only when the platinum point and the platinum disc are in\r\ncontact. The screw is adjusted so as to bring the point as near as\r\npossible to the disc without actual contact. The chronograph cylinder\r\nhaving been set in motion, a small pistol is fired into the pneumatic\r\ntube through a side opening. Sound-waves of alternate compression and\r\nrarefaction pass along the tube, and are reflected backwards and\r\nforwards many times in succession between the obstacle and the membrane.\r\nBy these the membrane is alternately forced out and drawn in, making and\r\nbreaking the electric contact accordingly, and thus causing the point of\r\nthe electro-magnet to describe in the cylinder an indented line, the\r\nintervals of which indicate the time the sound requires to traverse the\r\ntube to the obstruction; and thus the position of the latter may be\r\nknown with sufficient accuracy.\r\n\r\nA very interesting application of the electric chronograph is to the\r\nmeasurement of the velocities of projectiles. The science of gunnery has\r\nacquired an exactness unknown before electricity was made to carry\r\nmessages from the cannon-ball in its swiftest flight, and to write the\r\nrecord of its own course. Instruments for thus measuring the velocities\r\nof projectiles have been contrived by several electricians, among whom\r\nWheatstone appears to have been the first. The principle in most of\r\nthese chronographs is precisely the same as that on which the apparatus\r\nrepresented in Fig. 316 is constructed. The action of the projectile\r\nwhich is electrically indicated is the severing of a slender wire, which\r\nis stretched from side to side of a wooden frame, so that it passes\r\ncontinuously backwards and forwards in parallel lines. Thus a kind of\r\nscreen is formed, through which the missile must pass, and in its\r\npassage must rupture the wire. If the wire conveys a current of\r\nelectricity, this current is therefore interrupted at the moment the\r\nball passes. Sometimes the immediate effect of the breaking of the wire\r\nis mechanical, as in Wheatstone’s arrangement, where the wire is\r\nstretched by a weight over a series of pulleys, and attached to a\r\ncontact-maker, which completes the circuit when it is set free by the\r\nrupture of the wire. A similar arrangement in the screens has been\r\nproposed by Mr. Siemens for the establishment of circuits in connection\r\nwith charged Leyden jars, the sparks of the discharges being made to\r\ntake place at the surface of a revolving cylinder of polished steel,\r\nwhere the place is shown by the spot they leave on the metal. M.\r\nPouillet’s chronoscope dispenses with the revolving cylinder, and\r\nmeasures the _duration_ of the current established by the projectile at\r\none part of its course and cut off at another, by the arc through which\r\nthe needle of a galvanometer is impelled.\r\n\r\nThe instrument which has been most employed in this country by\r\nartillerists is that invented by Professor Bashforth. Its indications\r\nare extremely accurate, for readings may be taken to the two-thousandth\r\npart of a second. From ten to fifteen screens are placed in the path of\r\nthe projectile at distances asunder which may vary from 15 ft. to 150\r\nft., but which, of course, are carefully measured. Each screen is formed\r\nof a wire carrying an independent current, which also circulates in the\r\ncoils of an electro-magnet. The ten electro-magnets have styles attached\r\nto their armatures in such a manner that when all the currents are\r\npassing, ten parallel spiral lines are traced on the surface of a\r\nvertical revolving cylinder, about 12 in. long and 4 in. diameter. The\r\ncylinder is covered with a sheet of highly-glazed paper coated with\r\nlampblack; and when the sheet is removed, the lampblack may be fixed on\r\nthe paper if desired, and the record made permanent. The equal intervals\r\nof time are marked on the same cylinder by another electro-magnet\r\nconnected with a pendulum beating half-seconds. The axis of the\r\nrevolving cylinder, &c., carries a heavy flywheel, which is set in\r\nmotion by the hand at the rate of about three revolutions in two\r\nseconds, and the rest of the mechanism is thrown into gear just before\r\nthe signal to fire is given. The arrangement of the electric connections\r\nat the screens is such that at the moment of the rupture of the wire,\r\nthe circuit is broken for an instant only. At this moment, the iron of\r\nthe corresponding electro-magnet ceasing to attract its armature, the\r\nlatter is drawn away by a spring; but the re-establishment of the\r\ncurrent immediately brings it back, and the style continues to trace the\r\nsame spiral line as before. The passage of the ball through the screen\r\nis therefore marked by a little notch in the spiral line, thus, ——ᐱ——,\r\nand the point where the deviation begins indicates the time at which the\r\nball passed. In order to read off this time, a straight-edge is applied\r\nto the cylinder parallel to its axis; and by means of a scale sliding\r\nupon the straight-edge the distances between the notches on the several\r\nspirals are compared with those between the pendulum marks.\r\n\r\nTo record the instant at which a projectile passes determined points in\r\na cannon’s bore, lateral plugs are screwed in, each having, just\r\nprojecting into the bore, a small steel ball, which, pressed outwards by\r\nthe passing projectile, causes a cutter to divide the primary wire of a\r\nRuhmkorff coil, whereupon the spark that passes in the secondary circuit\r\nleaves its record on a uniformly moving disc. Each plug has its own\r\nbattery, coil, and disc.\r\n\r\nA special feature of recording instruments may be exemplified by certain\r\napplications of the principle to the investigation of physiological\r\nactions. A skilled physician is often able to detect in the pulse of his\r\npatient certain characteristics besides the mere rate, which are highly\r\nsignificant as regards the condition of the circulatory system. The\r\nrange of these indications has been greatly extended by an instrument\r\ninvented by MM. Chauveau and Marey, by which the pulse is made to write\r\ndown a graphic representation of its action. The patient’s arm having\r\nbeen placed on a suitable support, a little stud covered with soft\r\nleather is lightly pressed against the artery by a spring. The stud is\r\nin contact with the shorter end of a very light lever, the other\r\nextremity of which is furnished with a point, which registers its\r\nmovements on a cylinder of blackened metal, made to rotate and advance\r\nlongitudinally by clockwork; or the record is taken on strips of flat\r\nsmoked glass. As the motion is much magnified by the lever, every\r\nvariation in the pressure of the blood in the artery during the beat of\r\nthe pulse is distinctly and faithfully indicated. From the line so\r\ntraced the physician may obtain infallible data for judging of the\r\ncondition of the heart, the action of its valves, &c. It is marvellous\r\nto observe the manner in which the curves of the _sphygmograph_, as the\r\ninstrument is termed, change their form when certain drugs are\r\nadministered: the change in some cases occurs immediately, so that the\r\neye can detect by the inspection of the sphygmographic curve almost the\r\ninstant at which the drug was introduced into the system, and the nature\r\nof its action on the heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 317.—_Negretti’s Deep-Sea Thermometer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother instrument which is doing good service in the hands of medical\r\ninvestigators is the _spirograph_, in which the rise and fall of the\r\nchest in breathing are similarly traced by the motions of a lever. In\r\nthis instrument a small pad, which presses on the chest, communicates\r\nits movements to an elastic membrane, which, like the skin of a\r\ndrumhead, covers one end of a cylindrical box maintained in a fixed\r\nposition relatively to the person of the patient. The air in this box is\r\nin communication, by means of a flexible tube, with the interior of\r\nanother similarly closed box; the elastic membrane of the latter acts\r\nagainst the short end of a lever, which is made to register its\r\nmovements as in the sphygmograph, for the compression of the air caused\r\nby the rise of the chest is conveyed to the second box through the\r\nflexible tube. The curves furnished by this instrument also give\r\nvaluable indications, and exhibit marked changes under any influence in\r\nthe least degree affecting the respiratory system.\r\n\r\nThe value of a self-registering instrument for solving problems, the\r\nintricacy of which is increased by the multiplicity and rapidity of the\r\nactions to be observed, cannot be better illustrated than by the success\r\nwith which Professor Marey has thus studied some complicated actions of\r\nlocomotion, as related in his extremely interesting work entitled, “La\r\nMachine Animale,” a translation of which has appeared in “The\r\nInternational Series.” The action of the horse in the various paces,\r\nwalking, trotting, galloping, &c., has been an endless subject of\r\ndiscussion, with no other data than the shoe-marks left in soft ground,\r\nand the general appearance of the animal’s movements to an observer. But\r\nM. Marey—by means of elastic bags containing air, communicating the\r\npressure through flexible tubes, so as to move little levers, which\r\nwrite their traces on a revolving cylinder impelled by clockwork, and\r\ncarried by the rider,—has completely and finally settled all the points\r\nin dispute. It is now definitely known how the horse’s feet are placed\r\non the ground in each of his paces, and the actual and relative time\r\nthat each foot remains down. The instruments are also made to register\r\nthe vertical movements of the animal, so that a complete record of its\r\nmotion can be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 318.—_Negretti’s Deep-Sea Thermometer, general arrangement._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was long a difficulty to obtain data as to the temperature of the sea\r\nat great depths below the surface. It is obvious that the ordinary\r\nmaximum and minimum registering thermometers would not give the\r\ntemperature at any particular depth to which they might be submerged,\r\nbut merely the temperature of the warmest or coldest stratum of water\r\nthrough which they passed in their descent or ascent. No plan which has\r\nbeen devised to obviate these difficulties appears to have been attended\r\nwith success, until a quite recent invention of Messrs. Negretti and\r\nZambra supplied the desideratum, and furnished a convenient instrument\r\nfor trustworthy determination of the temperature of the ocean at any\r\nrequired depth. The same firm long ago constructed thermometers for\r\ndeep-sea soundings, with bulbs protected from the pressure of the water\r\nby an outer covering of thick glass surrounding the delicate bulb of the\r\nthermometer, between which and the outer casing a space was left,\r\npartially filled with mercury, so that heat might readily pass to or\r\nfrom the inner bulb without the latter being exposed to the\r\nsuperincumbent pressure. The new recording deep-sea thermometer differs,\r\nhowever, from all other registering thermometers by containing mercury\r\nonly, without alcohol, or springs, or other removable indices, and,\r\nconsequently, it is free from liability to derangement. The following is\r\nthe description of the instrument:\r\n\r\nIn the first place it must be observed that the bulb of the thermometer\r\nis protected so as to resist the pressure of the ocean, which varies\r\naccording to depth, that of 3,000 fathoms being something like 3 tons\r\npressure on the square inch. The new instrument is in shape like a\r\nsyphon with parallel legs, all in one piece, and having a continuous\r\ncommunication, as shown in Fig. 317. The scale of the thermometer is\r\npivoted on a centre, and being attached in a vertical position to a\r\nsimple apparatus (which will be presently described), is lowered to any\r\ndepth that may be desired. In its descent the thermometer acts as an\r\nordinary instrument, the mercury rising or falling according to the\r\ntemperature of the stratum through which it passes; but so soon as the\r\ndescent ceases, and a reverse motion is given to the line, so as to pull\r\nthe thermometer towards the surface, the instrument turns once on its\r\ncentre, first bulb uppermost, and afterwards bulb downwards. This causes\r\nthe mercury, which was in the left-hand column, first to pass into the\r\ndilated syphon-bend at the top, and thence into the right-hand tube,\r\nwhere it remains, indicating on a graduated scale the exact temperature\r\nat the time the thermometer was turned over. The cut shows the position\r\nof the mercury _after_ the instrument has been turned on its centre. A\r\nis the bulb; B the outer coating or protecting cylinder; C is the space\r\nof rarefied air, which is reduced if the outer casing be compressed; D\r\nis a small glass plug, as in Negretti and Zambra’s maximum thermometer,\r\nwhich at the moment of turning cuts off the mercury in the tube from\r\nthat in the bulb, thereby ensuring that none but the former can be\r\ntransferred into the indicating column; E is an enlargement made in the\r\nbend, so as to enable the mercury to pass quickly from one tube to\r\nanother in revolving; and F is the indicating tube, or thermometer\r\nproper. When the thermometer is put in motion, as soon as the tube has\r\nacquired a slightly oblique position, the mercury breaks off at the\r\npoint D, runs into the curved and enlarged portion, E, and eventually\r\nfalls into the tube, F, as the instrument resumes its original vertical\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319.—_The Atmospheric Recording Instrument._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe contrivance for turning the thermometer over at the bottom of the\r\nsea may be described as a vertical propeller, to which the instrument is\r\npivoted. So long as the instrument is descending the propeller is lifted\r\nout of gear and revolves free; but as soon as the ascent commences, the\r\naction is reversed, the propeller falls into gear with a pinion\r\nconnected with the thermometer, and by these means the thermometer is\r\nturned over, and after one turn it remains locked and immovable. The\r\nengraving, Fig. 318, shows the general arrangement, T being the\r\nthermometer, S a metal screw connected with the frame of the thermometer\r\nby a wheel-and-pinion movement at W; S^† is the stop for arresting the\r\nmovement of the thermometer when it has made one complete turn.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric recording thermometer (Fig. 319) differs from the\r\ndeep-sea thermometer by not having the double or protected bulb, as it\r\nis not required to resist pressures. In this form of the instrument, the\r\nthermometer is turned over by a simple clock movement, which can be set\r\nto any hour that may be desired. It is fixed on the clock, and when the\r\nhand arrives at the hour determined upon, and to which the clock has\r\nbeen set as an alarum clock is set, a spring is released, and the\r\nthermometer turns over as before described. A wet and dry-bulb\r\nhygrometer is also arranged on the same plan. For observatories, or\r\nwhere it is important to obtain hourly or half-hourly records of the\r\ntemperature, twelve or more thermometers are placed on a frame, and\r\nthese are turned over by clockwork one after the other at every hour or\r\nhalf-hour as required.\r\n\r\nThe reader can hardly fail to perceive that powerful aid to the\r\ninvestigation of the laws of nature must be afforded by such instruments\r\nas we have described. And we have but taken an example here and there of\r\nthe scientific uses of the recording principle, selecting those that are\r\nmost readily understood, or that are connected with matters coming home\r\nto the business and bosom of every one. The science of meteorology does\r\nnot deal with subjects which furnish merely amusing speculation for the\r\nhour. Forecasts of storms and cyclones would often save many lives and\r\nmuch valuable property; and our dependence upon meteorological\r\nconditions cannot be more forcibly illustrated than by reference to the\r\ndisastrous floods which this year (1875) desolated some districts of\r\nFrance. Meteorology has received a great impulse from the introduction\r\nof recording instruments; and the vast number of results which are now\r\nhourly recorded must lead to the certain development of the science, and\r\nits reduction to exact laws. For even the winds obey laws—laws as\r\ndefinite as those which control the motions of the planets; and could we\r\nbut take into account _the whole_ of the circumstances upon which the\r\nmovements and other conditions of the atmosphere depend, we should be\r\nable to forecast the weather with the same certainty as—thanks to the\r\ngreat and simple law of gravitation—we predict eclipses or other\r\nastronomical phenomena. Already, by aid of the telegraph, it is often\r\npossible to send a day’s warning of approaching storms to localities\r\nlying in their probable track. The Signal Service, which is a Department\r\nof the United States War Office, has a corps of meteorological observers\r\nspread over the length and breadth of the States, who send every eight\r\nhours, to a Central Office in Washington, a report of the force and\r\ndirection of the wind, height of the barometer, &c. The officer at\r\nWashington sends back by telegraph to the public press a synopsis of\r\neach day’s weather, and points out what weather will probably follow;\r\nbut if any city or port be threatened with a storm, special telegrams\r\nare sent. Thus, a warning of the approach of a great storm, which\r\nentered the American continent at San Francisco on the 22nd Feb., 1871,\r\nwas sent to Cheyenne, Omaha, and Chicago, twenty-four hours before the\r\nstorm reached these cities, which it was foreseen lay in its track.\r\nAlthough the hurricane did much damage at some of these places, it would\r\nprobably have been far more destructive had not the inhabitants been\r\nprepared for its approach.\r\n\r\nAn elegant form of _barograph_ or recording barometer has been brought\r\nout, which is small, but sufficiently accurate for all ordinary\r\npurposes. It is founded on the _aneroid_, which, as everybody knows, is\r\nan instrument for indicating atmospheric pressure by the changes of form\r\nit produces in a thin circular metallic box, partially exhausted of air.\r\nThe ordinary form of the aneroid is very sensitive and portable\r\n(sometimes it is made only the size of a small watch), and bears an\r\nindex needle moving over a graduated disc; which arrangement is in the\r\nbarograph aneroid, replaced by a long lever, carrying an ink tracing\r\npoint in contact with the face of a cylinder that is caused by clockwork\r\nto make one revolution per week. On the cylinder is spread a printed\r\npaper diagram, divided by lines for each day of the week and each hour\r\nof the day, and on this the tracing point marks a continuous curve,\r\nshowing all the fluctuations of the barometric pressure. The diagram is\r\nremoved at the end of the week, and a fresh form adjusted to the\r\ncylinder. The impressed papers thus form a permanent and continuous\r\nrecord, from which the height of the barometer, at any given moment, may\r\nbe read off.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _THE PHONOGRAPH._\r\n\r\nEverything yet contrived in the way of recording instruments is eclipsed\r\nin wonder and interest by one which is among the latest marvels of the\r\nage. It is a recording instrument, and more than a recording instrument,\r\nfor it can reproduce to the senses the very phenomena it records; and\r\nthese same phenomena are the most familiar in their effects, and, at the\r\nsame time, so subtle and delicate, that the impressions they convey are\r\nnot generally thought of otherwise than in connection with our finest\r\nintellectual and emotional perceptions. We are alluding to the\r\n_phonograph_, which can register for us music and song, and articulate\r\nhuman speech in all their tones and modulations, and, like an aërial\r\nspirit, address them to the ear again, as often as we wish, and thus\r\n\r\n            Inform the cell of hearing, dark and blind;\r\n            Intricate labyrinth, more dread for thought\r\n            To enter than oracular cave,\r\n            Strict passage through which sighs are brought,\r\n            And whispers for the heart, their slave;\r\n            And shrieks, that revel in abuse\r\n            Of shivering flesh; and warbled air,\r\n            Whose piercing sweetness can unloose\r\n            The chains of frenzy, or entice a smile\r\n            Into the ambush of despair;\r\n            Hosannas pealing down the long-drawn aisle,\r\n            And requiems answered by the pulse that beats\r\n            Devoutly, in life’s last retreats!\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may understand the action of the phonograph, it\r\nis necessary that he should know something of the science of sound. Then\r\nwe must remember that this word is commonly used to express sometimes\r\nthose sensations of which the ear is the organ, and at other times the\r\nexternal cause of those sensations. It is with the former meaning that\r\nwe use such expressions as “a sweet sound”; with the latter, such\r\nphrases as “sound travels.” It will not be necessary to speak of the\r\nphysiology of the organ of hearing; but attention should be directed to\r\nthe different kinds of audible perceptions we can distinguish, let us\r\nsuppose, when listening to a song: First, there is the pitch, or the\r\nnotes in the musical scale, which, by their particular sequence,\r\nconstitute the air or melody. Second, there is the degree of loudness or\r\nlowness of the notes. Third, the enunciation, or those differences by\r\nwhich we distinguish, for example, the vowels _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_,\r\none from another. Fourth, the quality of the voice by which we can\r\ndistinguish between two vocalists singing the same vowel on the same\r\nnote with equal loudness. Observe that these four kinds of sound\r\nperceptions are independent one of another. The last kind of difference\r\nmay also be well illustrated by the instance of musical instruments of\r\ndifferent kinds sounding the same note, in which case the difference of\r\nthe quality or _timbre_ is readily recognized. We have now to show the\r\nnature of the mechanical movements outside of us which act on the ear\r\nand reach our perception as sounds, giving the distinguishable\r\nimpressions that have been enumerated; and for the present we shall\r\nconsider the case of such musical sounds as those just referred to.\r\n\r\nThat the source of a sustained sound is an elastic body in a state of\r\nvibration is a fact of which, in most cases, we are easily made aware by\r\nthe evidence of sight and touch; as a bell, a violoncello string, a\r\npianoforte wire, or a tuning-fork. On p. 656 is described a simple\r\nmethod by which a tuning-fork may be made to write down its own\r\nvibrations, and the more exact plan of recording them on the surface of\r\nblackened paper on a revolving and advancing cylinder has also been\r\nreferred to. By the intervention of appropriate apparatus, a similar\r\nrecord may be obtained from all sounding bodies. From observations of\r\nthis kind, and others in which totally different methods are used for\r\ncounting the number of vibrations per vibrations made in a given time,\r\nit is known that the _pitch_ of the sound or note depends on the\r\nrapidity of the vibrations—the pitch rises with the number of them per\r\nsecond, and the relationship between the notes of a musical scale\r\ndepends entirely on these numbers. Thus, when the vibrations for the\r\neight notes of an octave are counted, the numbers always have this\r\n_proportion_, beginning from the lowest note-–24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40,\r\n45, 48. Thus of the two notes—\r\n\r\n[Music]\r\n\r\nas produced on musical instruments tuned to the concert pitch of the\r\npresent day, the lower corresponds with 264 complete vibrations per\r\nsecond, the higher with 528. It will be observed, too, that all the\r\nharmonies are determined by some simple ratio in the rates of vibration:\r\nthe interval of the _fourth_ is 3, 4; that of the _fifth_ is 2, 3, etc.\r\nAnother easily discoverable fact is that the loudness of the sound\r\ndepends upon the amplitude of the vibrations. This is sufficiently\r\nobvious by a few experiments with a tuning fork; and by close\r\nexamination of such tracings as have been mentioned, we shall soon\r\nbecome aware of another circumstance—namely, that the vibrations not\r\nsimple, but that the larger or general movement has one or more sets of\r\nsmall vibrations within it. In Fig. 319_a_, A is the curve that would be\r\ntraced by the tuning-fork in a state of simple vibration; B and C are\r\ntracing such as are given by a fork in two of its modes of vibration.\r\nThe fork gives out its proper or fundamental note in both cases; but the\r\near recognizes a difference in the quality of the sound due to the\r\nsmaller and more numerous vibrations. Differences of the same kind are\r\nrecognized in the notes produced by different musical instruments; but\r\nthese are usually more complicated, and their forms are characteristic\r\nof the particular quality of the tone, which is thus shown to be due to\r\nthe superposing of several related systems of vibration upon the\r\nfundamental one. Thus three out of the four qualities of sound\r\nrecognized by the ear have had their physical causes assigned. As for\r\nthe fourth—namely, the distinction we perceive among the different\r\nvowels sung on the same note—it has a physical origin identical with the\r\nlast. For since parts of the vocal organs assume different positions in\r\nenunciating the different vowels, they constitute for the time being so\r\nmany varied musical instruments, and the graphical traces of the sounds\r\n(for they can be obtained) show a corresponding modification. Here, in\r\nFig. 319_b_, for example, are represented the tracings of the vibrations\r\ngiven to the air in various vowel sounds. It is also through the\r\nvibrations conveyed by the air to the little membrane called the drum of\r\nthe ear that the sensations of sound are received, and of the nature of\r\nthese vibrations a few words must be said presently. In considering the\r\ndifferent qualities of sound, we have so far confined ourselves to\r\nsustained musical notes, as, for instance, the vowel sounds in singing.\r\nThis has been done to show the relations of rapidity of vibration to\r\npitch and for simplicity of illustration of the superposition of\r\nvibrations, etc. Two other remarks must be added—viz., that the\r\nvibrations of musical tones are _isochronous_—that is, whether the note\r\nbe loud or soft, the same time is taken up in each vibration\r\ncorresponding with the same fundamental note. Other vocal sounds than\r\nsustained vowel notes are found to be due to still more complicated\r\ncombinations of vibrations of shorter duration, and _noises_, as\r\ndistinguished from musical sound, are formed also by the superposition\r\nof a greater or less number of systems of vibrations, the rapidities of\r\nwhich are wanting in harmonic relations such as we have pointed out\r\nbelong to the musical scale. Even in noises, however, there is often one\r\nor more predominant systems of vibrations which a musical ear can\r\ndetect. If the reader will hold a pencil or penholder at one end and tap\r\nwith it on the edge of the table, passing in quick succession to parts\r\nprogressively nearer where the pencil is held, he will hardly fail to\r\nrecognize a rising pitch in the little noises.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319_a_.—_Traces of Vibrations of a Tuning-Fork._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319_b_.—_Phonautographic Tracings of Different Vowel Sounds._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319_c_.—_Diagram._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319_d_.—_Phases of Sound Waves._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA word or two must be said as to the way in which sound is transmitted\r\nthrough the air. This progression is commonly spoken of as a wave\r\nmotion, but it must not be thought of as taking place in the form\r\nfamiliar to us as waves on water; still less must the reader confound it\r\nwith the sinuous lines shown in the graphical representations of\r\nvibrations given in the figures. It is rather a series of rapid\r\npulsations of the particles of the air taking place in the direction in\r\nwhich the sound is propagated, and resembling waves on water only by\r\npresenting periodical phases in uniform succession. The difference may\r\nbe illustrated from what may be seen in a field of wheat when the wind\r\nis blowing over it. The stalks bend down, and rise again when the breeze\r\nhas passed, and thus the general appearance of the waves of the sea is\r\nproduced. If we confine our attention, however, to the motion of the\r\nseveral ears of the wheat in a file of stalks, we shall obtain a clearer\r\nnotion of what takes place in the so-called waves of sound. The\r\npositions of the stalks at some one instant of time may be represented\r\nby the diagram, Fig. 319_c_. Each stalk is swinging backwards and\r\nforwards like an inverted pendulum, and the successive phases of these\r\nvibrations bring the adjacent ears nearest to each other about _i_, and\r\nfarthest apart at _a_ and _a´_. The places of these, and of all the\r\nintermediate degrees of approximation and retreat, pass along the file.\r\nInstead of the ears of wheat swinging on their elastic stalks, suppose\r\nparticles of air approaching and receding by virtue of the elasticity by\r\nwhich they resist compression and recover from it, and you will obtain\r\nan elementary idea of what takes place in the transmission of sound.\r\nFig. 319_d_ is a picture of a column of air acted upon by a tuning-fork.\r\nThe swiftly advancing prong is compressing the air in front of it, and\r\nin swinging back it will tend to leave a vacuum behind it by which the\r\nair is partially rarefied; and these alternate condensations and\r\nrarefactions will travel along through the air by virtue of its\r\nelasticity, and the mechanical action by which they are able to agitate\r\na stretched membrane (or other elastic body), so that its vibrations\r\nwill correspond with them in period and magnitude, may be easily\r\nunderstood. The vibration produced is a simple one, but any number of\r\nother systems may pass at the same time, and each one will be propagated\r\nas if the rest did not exist, just as we may see different systems of\r\nundulations moving on the surface of water. It should be observed that\r\nthe velocity of propagation is the same whatever may be the period or\r\nthe magnitude of the vibrations. The high and the low, the loud and the\r\nsoft notes of a piece of music played at a distance, all take the same\r\ntime in reaching the ear. Light as are the particles of air, the\r\nmechanical actions which a number of them carrying strong vibratory\r\nimpulses will produce, may be illustrated by the rattling of window\r\npanes by a loud peal of thunder, and may be bodily felt by a person\r\nstanding close to a very large bell while the hour is striking.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to instruments for registering sound, and even vocal\r\nsounds, before anything has been said of the construction of the\r\nphonograph, and it is, in fact, many years since the problem was solved\r\nof recording the vibrations produced by speech. Mr. Leo Scott, in 1856,\r\ninvented an instrument, called the _Phonautograph_, which did this. It\r\nconsisted of a cone of sheet zinc like a large ear-trumpet, across the\r\nsmaller end of which was stretched a membrane, having attached to it a\r\nvery light style, which left a record of the vibrations of the membrane\r\non a blackened cylinder properly disposed to receive the tracing. When\r\nany sound was produced near the open end of the cone, the impulses\r\nreflected from its internal surface were concentrated on the membrane,\r\nthrowing it into corresponding vibrations. Now, this process could be\r\nreversed if the tracing could be made to give back again to the style\r\nits original movements, these transferred to the membrane would throw\r\nthe air within the cone into corresponding vibrations, and the sounds\r\nthat gave rise to the tracing would be reproduced. Yet Mr. Scott seems\r\nto have suggested no such possibilities for his instrument; but a few\r\nyears after the invention of the phonautograph, M. Cros deposited at the\r\nAcademy of Sciences in Paris a sealed paper, which was opened after Mr.\r\nEdison had patented the phonograph (1877), and found to contain\r\nsuggestions of how this might be done, but describing no experiments in\r\nwhich any approach had been made towards realizing the conditions laid\r\ndown. To Mr. Edison belongs the honour of solving the problem by the\r\ninvention of the phonograph, which was patented by him in 1877. The\r\ndevice which he happily hit upon for converting the phonautograph into a\r\nphonograph was very simple in principle, and consisting merely in\r\nsubstituting a sheet of tinfoil for the blackened paper in Scott’s\r\napparatus, the mechanism required for reproducing articulate human\r\nspeech was thus found, contrary to all expectations that had previously\r\nbeen entertained, to be essentially of a remarkably simple character,\r\nfor the arrangement of the parts was even more direct than in the\r\nphonautograph itself. This is not derogatory to the merit of the\r\ninventor, for every invention depends upon something previously\r\nattained, and the discovery of suitable materials for the various parts\r\nof the machine, and the many delicate adjustments of their forms and\r\ndisposition to secure the required object, demanded the application of\r\nvery remarkable experimental skill. The phonograph differs from the\r\nphonautograph by giving up what it has registered in the original form\r\nand material, and thus it is a speaking machine. It is a speaking\r\nmachine which _reproduces_ articulate speech, not produces it. Much\r\ningenuity has been devoted to the construction of speaking machines\r\nwhich should be capable of _producing_ the sounds of the human voice. By\r\nthrowing into vibration the air contained in cavities of certain shapes,\r\nit was long ago found possible to produce sounds closely resembling\r\nthose of a voice singing particular vowels, and a real speaking machine\r\nthat could articulate words was exhibited in America before the\r\nphonograph had been brought out. It was constructed by Mr. Faber, and\r\nformed a very complicated arrangement, in which all the organs of human\r\nspeech were imitated. There were bellows acting like the lungs; a larynx\r\nwith various diaphragms, a mouth with movable tongue and lips, and a\r\ntube to resemble the cavity of the nose. The positions and connections\r\nof these parts were determined by levers acted from a key-board, like\r\nthat of a piano, and by certain pedals. By moving these in proper order,\r\nthe machine pronounced words distinctly enough, but in a strange\r\ndrawling tone. So like, however, were the sounds to those of the human\r\nvoice, that some accused the exhibitors of imposition, and unjustly\r\ncredited ventriloquism instead of mechanism with the results. It will be\r\nobserved that it is the function of the phonograph to reproduce, not\r\nproduce, human speech, and the mechanical arrangements of the instrument\r\nare simplicity itself compared with Faber’s speaking machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319_e_.—_Edison’s Original Phonograph._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319_f_.—_Diagrammatic Section of Phonograph._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319_g_.—_The Graphophone._\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 319_e_ shows the form of the phonograph as designed by Mr. Edison\r\nin 1877. It had a brass cylinder (A) upon which a narrow helical groove\r\nwas cut, and was mounted upon an axle (B), having a narrow screw-thread\r\ncorresponding with the groove on the cylinder, and working in the\r\nupright (C), so that when the handle was turned the cylinder revolved,\r\nand at the same time advanced in the direction of its axis. A heavy\r\nfly-wheel (D) was attached, in order that the rate of motion might be\r\nnearly uniform. A sheet of tinfoil, or of very thin copper, was wrapped\r\nround the brass cylinder, and on this metallic foil rested the steel\r\npoint attached to the vibrating diaphragm, which was mounted in the ring\r\n(F). This point was always adjusted so as to be over the helical groove\r\nin the cylinder, and made to touch the tinfoil with a regulated\r\npressure. E shows the manner of firmly supporting the diaphragm in such\r\na manner that it could be readily removed from the cylinder when the\r\nlatter had to be covered afresh with tinfoil, or the cylinder adjusted\r\nfor reproducing the sounds. The relation of the diaphragm and point to\r\nthe tinfoil is shown in Fig. 319_f_, which represents the apparatus in\r\nsection. The tracing point (_t_) is not attached directly to the\r\nvibrating diaphragm, but to an adjustable spring (_s_), and interposed\r\nbetween the spring and the thin metallic diaphragm is a little pad,\r\nformed of a ring of small india-rubber tubing. When the mouthpiece (M)\r\nis spoken into, the sound vibrations reach the diaphragm (_g g_) through\r\nthe opening (_o_), and the movements thus communicated to the point\r\n(_t_) which indents the tinfoil to various depths, and with varying\r\nfrequency, as the handle is turned, bringing the whole length of the\r\ngroove in succession to be operated upon. When the instrument is\r\nrequired to reproduce the speech so easily recorded, all that is\r\nnecessary is to allow the indentations to re-act on the point that made\r\nthem. The cylinder is re-adjusted to the tracing point at the end at\r\nwhich it began, the cylinder is set in motion, and the traces made on\r\nthe tinfoil move the point up and down, the vibrating disc (_g_)\r\nfollowing its movements, and thus communicating to the air a system of\r\nimpulses which are the counterparts in period, force and succession of\r\nthose that originally entered at _o_. It was usual to attach a conical\r\nmouthpiece to the ring (F) in order to concentrate the reproduced\r\nsounds, which might then be heard in all parts of a large room. When, in\r\nreproducing the sounds, the cylinder was turned with the same velocity\r\nas when the words were spoken, the pitch of the voice issuing from the\r\ninstrument was the same. If it were turned quicker, the pitch was\r\nraised; if slower, lowered. The words registered on the tinfoil could be\r\nreproduced two or three times, but with decreasing distinctness, as the\r\ntracings gradually become obliterated. However, the sheet could be\r\nremoved from the cylinder, and the speech reproduced at any place at any\r\ntime afterwards by means of a similar instrument, and a method of\r\nstereotyping was proposed for preserving the records. The original\r\nphonograph was greatly improved when well regulated clockwork was used\r\nfor imparting motion instead of the winch. Mr. Edison contrived a\r\nmodification of the machine, which made it much easier of manipulation,\r\nby substituting for the cylinder a flat plate on which a spiral groove\r\nwas cut. The plate was turned by clockwork, while the vibrating point\r\nwas made to follow the groove from the centre to the circumference. The\r\nphonograph in its original form reproduced speech with peculiarities of\r\nits own. The quality was metallic, and reminded one of the intonation of\r\nthe street Punch. It will easily be understood that the disc itself must\r\nnecessarily have its own systems of vibration, and these will be further\r\nmodified by the action of all the other parts. Mr. Edison’s expectations\r\nof the capabilities of the instrument not being realized, he turned his\r\nattention, after several unsuccessful attempts at its improvement, to\r\nthe electric light and other subjects, at the same time declaring his\r\nconviction that the perfection of the instrument would be but a matter\r\nof time; in fact, within a very few years afterwards such improvements\r\nwere made on Mr. Edison’s instrument as went far to justify this\r\nprophecy. These were the work of Dr. Chichester Bell and Mr. Tainter,\r\nwho, after long continued experiments, found in paraffin wax, with a\r\nsmall admixture of some other substances, a better material for\r\nreceiving the impressions. A cutting style made to act upon this cuts\r\nout a fine groove, the bottom of which is not a series of indentations,\r\nbut a continuous wavy curve, representing every degree of inflection the\r\nvibrating diaphragm. In the new form of the instrument, FIG. 319_g_,\r\nwhich was called the _graphophone_, to distinguish it from Edison’s, the\r\ncylinder does not move forward: it is the diaphragm that advances\r\nparallel to the revolving axle. The cylinder is driven by a treadle,\r\nlike a sewing-machine, and there is an ingenious arrangement by which\r\nthe speed is controlled so that it can be maintained quite uniform. The\r\nmovement of cylinder and style can be instantly arrested by touching a\r\nbutton, and as readily re-started. Quite recently Mr. Edison has\r\nreturned to improving the phonograph by using rather thick, solid\r\ncylinders of wax, which are previously prepared for use by the\r\ninstrument itself paring them down to a truly cylindrical and perfectly\r\nuniform surface, the result being a great increase of clearness in the\r\nspeech and tones of music. Mr. Edison’s new instruments are driven by\r\nsmall electro-motors, and the speed is regulated by a centrifugal\r\ngovernor. It is said that these wax cylinders are capable of giving out\r\nthe same record for a thousand times without perceptible sign of\r\ndeterioration; and when the cylinders are required to receive a fresh\r\nimpression, a former one can easily be pared off. The machines can be\r\narranged so as to sound loud enough to be heard by a large assembly; but\r\nthe quality of the tones of speech or music is most perfect when\r\nconveyed from the receiving chamber in front of the diaphragm to one or\r\nboth of the auditor’s ears by means of a short elastic tube. Half a\r\ndozen persons can thus hear the record on the cylinder with such\r\nmarvellous distinctness as to be able to recognize the tones of a known\r\nvoice. The very latest form of the instrument, as it has just left Mr.\r\nEdison’s hands, is represented in Fig. 319_h_. In this one single very\r\nsmall diaphragm serves both for recording and reproducing the sounds.\r\nThis is made of extremely thin glass, to which is attached a small\r\nprojection made of celluloid, which acts on a bar that carries the\r\nrecording point. The configuration of this point is most ingenious and\r\npeculiar, for it is, in fact, double, one part being shaped like a\r\ngouge, which cuts into the walls of the minute depression traced on the\r\nwax cylinder, while a style-shaped part impresses the wax with punctured\r\nindentations. The shaping of its forms is a difficult and delicate\r\noperation, for they are very small and are cut in sapphire. The\r\nreproduced speech given out by this instrument is said to possess the\r\nproperties of sharpness and clearness in a remarkable degree. The\r\nmachine is provided also with a sapphire cutting edge, by which an old\r\nrecord may be pared off by the very motion of the cylinder in receiving\r\na new one. This phonograph is put in movement by ingenious mechanical\r\ndevices, for giving uniform rotation from such motive power as may be\r\nsupplied by the foot or by water or by clockwork. This improved\r\ninstrument lays claim to practical utility, and its manufacture will, it\r\nis stated, be shortly commenced on a large scale.\r\n\r\nQuite recently there has been established in America a big manufactory\r\nof phonographs in the form of a toy, which is sure to become very\r\npopular everywhere. Here they turn out daily several hundred _real\r\nspeaking dolls_, which contain clockwork actuating a phonographic\r\ncylinder impressed with the words of some childish story or simple\r\nrhyme, such as “Jack and Jill,” “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” etc. Each doll\r\nof course repeats its little tale as often as the clockwork is set\r\ngoing. These toys are adapted to all nationalities; for, besides many\r\nEnglish, there are a number of French, German, Italian, etc., girls\r\nemployed doing nothing all day long but addressing appropriate words to\r\neach little automaton’s waxen cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319_h_.—_Edison’s Perfected Phonograph._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe capabilities of the phonograph suggest some curious applications\r\nthat may be made of it. For example, the songs of a fine singer may\r\nthus, in all their modulations, reach people in distant lands, or be\r\nmade audible to future generations. Thousands of people in England have\r\nheard with their ears, through Mr. Edison’s instruments lately brought\r\nover by Col. Gournaud, songs and speeches, and pieces of concerted\r\nmusic, sung, said, or played in America months before. Music can be\r\nbottled up, so to speak, without the consent of the originators; and,\r\nindeed, it is said that an eminent _prima donna_ has applied for an\r\ninjunction to restrain certain _phonographers_ from reproducing her\r\nvocal triumphs with their instruments. A speech of Mr. Gladstone’s,\r\ndelivered in England, has been phonographically heard in New York with\r\ngreat applause. There is no reason but what, with a loud speaking\r\nphonograph uttering an orator’s very words and tones, while\r\ninstantaneous photographs of his successive gestures and attitudes are\r\nprojected on a screen, a true and lively impression of his eloquence\r\nmight be conveyed centuries after his decease. One is almost led to\r\nspeculate as to the consequences if these nineteenth century inventions\r\nhad been antedated by a few thousand years: what stores of knowledge we\r\nmight now possess! and how pleasant it would be thus\r\n\r\n            To hear each voice we feared to hear no more!\r\n            Behold each mighty shade revealed to sight,\r\n        The Bactrian, Samian sage, and all who taught the right!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 320.—_The Domestic Aquarium._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AQUARIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the date of May 28th, 1665, the curious gossiping diary of Samuel\r\nPepys contains this entry: “Thence to see my Lady Pen, where my wife and\r\nI were shown a fine rarity; of fishes kept in a glass of water, that\r\nwill live so for ever—and finely marked they are, being foreign.” This\r\ndoubtless refers to the now well-known gold fishes, which about the time\r\nalluded to were introduced into Europe from China, where they had\r\nprobably been for ages reared and kept in captivity, chiefly for the\r\nsake of ornament. Perhaps the reader may be disposed to think that,\r\ntherefore, the aquarium cannot be distinctively a nineteenth century\r\ninvention, nor at all a modern invention, in principle at least; but\r\nmerely the “glass of water,” or the globe of gold fish on a larger\r\nscale. Such a notion would be quite incorrect, for the principles which\r\nare embodied in the modern aquarium were not recognized and applied\r\nuntil quite recently. Aquatic animals kept for a period in vessels in\r\nwhich the water is changed from time to time cannot be considered as\r\nproperly forming an aquarium. The beauty and value of a well-regulated\r\naquarium depend not merely on the opportunities it affords of studying\r\nthe habits of the animals; the spectacle it presents has a far wider\r\ninterest, as illustrating and confirming the conclusions of science\r\nregarding certain great principles which govern the whole animal and\r\nvegetable life of this terraqueous globe. Perhaps in the whole range of\r\nnature nothing is more wonderful than the direct interdependence of\r\nanimal and vegetable life, and the exact balance between them, which\r\npreserves the composition of the atmosphere unchanged. The constituents\r\nof the atmosphere have an immediate relation to both forms of life. No\r\nanimal can live without a supply of oxygen gas, which it absorbs and\r\nreplaces by carbonic acid gas. The latter, on the other hand, is\r\nabsorbed by plants, for these, under the influence of light, decompose\r\nthe carbonic acid, returning the oxygen to the atmosphere, thus\r\npurifying the air by again fitting it for the respiration of animals.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that animals which live entirely beneath the\r\nsurface of water are removed from the influence of atmospheric oxygen,\r\nand that they form exceptions to this law. But such is not the case, for\r\nwater absorbs and holds in solution a certain quantity of air, the\r\noxygen of which is taken up by aquatic animals. In the lower forms of\r\nanimals inhabiting water, the absorption of this vital element takes\r\nplace at the general surface of the body; but in the more highly\r\norganized creatures there are special organs appropriated to this\r\npurpose, of which the gills of a fish may be cited as a typical example.\r\nThe giving out of carbonic acid is an action as universal in the animal\r\nworld as the absorption of oxygen, and all aquatic animals tend to\r\ncharge the water in which they live with this gas. Fish, or any other\r\nwater animals, will soon die if they are placed in water from which all\r\nthe air has previously been expelled by boiling, or by placing under the\r\nreceiver of an air-pump. In this case the creature dies from want of\r\noxygen; but it would also die, even if supplied with oxygen, were the\r\npoisonous carbonic acid emitted by itself allowed to accumulate in the\r\nliquid. In nature, this carbonic acid forms the food of aquatic plants\r\nand sea-weeds, and these restore oxygen to the water. If a bunch of\r\nwatercresses be placed in a bottle filled with water, and exposed to\r\nstrong sunshine, the leaves may soon be seen covered with small bubbles\r\nof gas. This gas may be collected and examined by a suitable arrangement\r\nof the bottle, and it will be found to be pure oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe merit of having first imitated the plan of nature for the\r\npreservation of aquatic animals appears to belong to Mr. Ward, the\r\ninventor of the “Wardian cases” for ferns and other plants. He, in 1841,\r\nformed in London a fresh-water aquarium, in which, for the first time,\r\nthe animals were kept in a healthy condition by the compensating action\r\nof plants. Mr. Gosse, Dr. Price, and others, made experiments with\r\nmarine animals and plants, about 1850. Mr. Mitchell, who was then\r\nsecretary to the Zoological Society of London, saw about this time a\r\nsmall aquarium on the balancing principle at Dr. Bowerbank’s, and this\r\nsuggested the erection of the fish-house in the Zoological Gardens,\r\nRegent’s Park. This was opened in 1853, being the first public aquarium\r\never constructed. The tanks remain at the present time in nearly their\r\noriginal condition, and this aquarium has been remarkable, not only as\r\npredecessor of the many public aquaria which have since been erected,\r\nbut for having given rise to a movement in favour of aquaria as domestic\r\nestablishments. The setting-up of household aquaria became almost the\r\nrage of the day, and so many books and magazine articles devoted to the\r\nsubject appeared during the ten years following the establishment of the\r\nRegent’s Park aquarium, that the literature of the subject is quite\r\nconsiderable. Mr. Gosse showed how water for marine aquaria could be\r\nproduced by adding to fresh water the solid constituents of sea-water;\r\nand, in the marine aquaria of some inland towns far distant from the\r\nsea, this artificial sea-water is the only kind used. After the\r\nestablishment of the Regent’s Park aquarium, public aquaria were opened\r\nsuccessively in Dublin, Galway, Edinburgh, Scarborough, Weymouth, the\r\nCrystal Palace, Brighton, Manchester, and Southport; and on the\r\ncontinent at Paris, Hamburg, Hanover, Boulogne, Havre, Brussels,\r\nCologne, Vienna, and Naples; also in North America at San Francisco, and\r\nin other places. The general interest in public aquaria, and especially\r\nmarine aquaria on the large scale, seemed to increase as the comparative\r\nfailure of the domestic tanks lessened the taste for them. The causes of\r\nthe failure so often attending the attempt to maintain aquaria on the\r\nsmall scale arise partly from the amateur naturalist’s want of exact\r\nknowledge, and the great amount of attention and care required, and\r\npartly from the inherent difficulties of the subject. An aquarium, even\r\non the largest scale, and with every appliance that science can suggest,\r\nonly represents, after all, _a few_ of the conditions which actually\r\nexist in nature; but in small vessels, with a limited quantity of water,\r\nwithout the continual motion of the liquid, which belongs naturally to\r\nseas and streams, and with circumstances of light and temperature widely\r\ndifferent from those which are obtained in nature, it is not surprising\r\nthat the success of domestic aquaria should be but very partial, and\r\nthat the taste for them should have declined accordingly.\r\n\r\nMany public aquaria proved commercial failures; but we select for\r\nspecial description two which have been thoroughly efficient, and are\r\nremarkable for size, reputation, and successful management. The\r\narrangements at these two institutions as regards the aëration and\r\nrenewal of the water are, however, quite different. Some plan by which\r\nthe same sea-water might be supplied with oxygen, and kept in a clear\r\nand pure condition, was necessary for the very existence of the inland\r\nmarine aquarium at the Crystal Palace, whereas the position of Brighton\r\nmade the natural sea-water more available. The success of the former\r\nmethod at the Crystal Palace Aquarium, under the judicious system\r\nadopted by Mr. W. A. Lloyd, the superintendent, perhaps renders this\r\naquarium one of the most interesting, in a scientific point of view, of\r\nany yet in operation. The water here is never changed by the addition of\r\nsea-water; but fresh water is added as required, simply to supply the\r\nloss by evaporation; and any solid constituents which the animals may\r\nabstract from the water as material for their shells is replaced, so\r\nthat the ordinary composition of sea-water is maintained. This is merely\r\nimitating Nature, for the evaporation from the surface of the sea is\r\ncompensated by the fall of rain and the influx of rivers, the latter\r\nconstantly bringing in the various salts held in solution. The following\r\nparticulars regarding the Crystal Palace Aquarium are derived from Mr.\r\nLloyd’s excellent handbook, which contains not only clear descriptions\r\nof the inhabitants of the tanks, but interesting historical notices and\r\na well-written disquisition on the principles which should regulate the\r\nconstruction and management of aquaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _THE CRYSTAL PALACE AQUARIUM._\r\n\r\nThe building was commenced in July, 1870, and was opened in August,\r\n1871. It was designed by Mr. Driver, of Victoria Street, and presents an\r\nadmirable simplicity, which entirely accords with the purpose for which\r\nit was erected. The whole available space has been occupied, and nothing\r\nhas been wasted on unmeaning or fantastic embellishments. Even the\r\ndecorative shams, in which ordinary painters delight, have been\r\nexcluded. No part of the walls or of the woodwork is painted to look\r\nlike marble, or even to imitate oak. The building, which is about 400\r\nft. long and 70 ft. broad, is situated at the north end of the Palace,\r\npartially occupying the site of the portion which was so unfortunately\r\nburnt down in 1866. It is but one storey high, and besides a large\r\nreservoir beneath the floor, holding 100,000 gallons of sea-water, there\r\nis a series of sixty tanks, with thick plate-glass fronts, which\r\ncollectively contain 20,000 gallons of water. This water, weighing over\r\n1,000,000 lbs., was brought from the coast and conveyed to the Palace by\r\nthe Brighton Railway Company at a very moderate rate. For many weeks\r\nafter the water was placed in the reservoir and tanks it was very\r\nturbid, from taking up the lime used in their construction and in that\r\nof the rockwork. In this condition it was very alkaline; but the lime\r\nwas slowly precipitated by the carbonic acid of the air, the water\r\nbecame clear, and vegetation appeared in the tanks. The great capacity\r\nof the reservoir facilitates the cleansing of the water; for, supposing\r\nthat the water in one of the tanks, holding, say, 6,000 gallons, became\r\nturbid from any cause, the water from this tank could be run off into\r\nthe reservoir, where its mixture with the much larger quantity would not\r\nsensibly affect the purity of the mass, from which within half an hour\r\nthe tank could again be filled.\r\n\r\nAll the tanks are constantly receiving water from the clear and cool\r\nreservoir below, in which there are no animals, so that the motion of\r\nthe water in the tanks, like that of the ocean, is incessant. The water\r\nissues from the pump at a rate (indicated by a counter) of from 5,000 to\r\n7,000 gallons per hour. The pump is worked by a steam engine of three\r\nhorse-power, and the machinery requires the unremitting attention of\r\nthree engineers, who succeed each other by turns, each working for eight\r\nhours. Two sets of the machinery—pumps, steam engines, and boilers—are\r\nprovided, one being always kept in reserve, ready for use in case of any\r\naccident. Even in winter, when, from the lower temperature, the water\r\ncontains the largest amount of oxygen, it is found that the stopping of\r\nthe circulation of the water for only a few hours occasions manifest\r\ndiscomfort to some of the animals. The water is poured into the two\r\ncentre tanks in an equally divided stream, and by a simple fall of a few\r\ninches from tank to tank it flows by two routes to the lowest tank, from\r\nwhich it passes into the reservoir below. This incessant circulation of\r\nthe water constantly exposes fresh surfaces to the action of the air, by\r\nwhich oxygen is absorbed. But besides this, other small streams of water\r\nare made to forcibly enter the tanks from jets, by which a large\r\nquantity of air is carried down in very small bubbles. The removal of\r\ncarbonic acid is accomplished by the vegetation which spontaneously\r\nmakes its appearance in sea-water under suitable circumstances. It has\r\nbeen found quite unnecessary to introduce purposely any kind of\r\nsea-weeds, for the spores of low forms of vegetation are always present\r\nin the water, and they develop rapidly under the stimulus of light.\r\nIndeed, one of the difficulties of aquarium management is to avoid this\r\nexcessive vegetation by limiting the light as much as possible, and yet\r\nleave sufficient illumination for the observation of the animals. The\r\namount of light falling upon each tank is very carefully attended to at\r\nthe Crystal Palace, and where it cannot be diminished sufficiently to\r\ncheck the overgrowth of vegetation, without at the same time interfering\r\nwith a proper view of the animals, certain molluscs and fishes which\r\nlive upon _algæ_ are put into the tanks to consume them. This\r\nspontaneous vegetation is so vigorous that a comparatively small\r\nquantity suffices to remove from the water all the carbonic acid which\r\nit may derive from the animals and decomposing matters.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that at this aquarium the water is never\r\nfiltered, but its clearness is obtained merely by the perfect system of\r\ncirculation. The unused food and excrementitious matters are oxygenated\r\nby the air which the water abundantly holds in solution—thanks to the\r\nsurface exposed in its constant circulation, the injection of the jets\r\nof water carrying minute bubbles of air into the mass of water, and the\r\ngas given off by the vegetation. The whole process of purification is\r\ntherefore chemical, and the success and excellent adaptation of the\r\nsystem may be judged from the fact that the water seen in masses 9 ft.\r\ndeep appears perfectly clear and bright. The building is very cool in\r\nsummer: even in extremely hot weather the temperature of the air within\r\nit is never higher than 68° F., and that of the water in the tanks never\r\nexceeds 63°. In winter the temperature of the air is maintained by\r\nhot-water pipes at from 60° to 65°, and the temperature of the water at\r\nabout 55°. On winter evenings the aquarium is illuminated with gas, and\r\nthe habits of many nocturnal animals can then be conveniently studied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 321.—_The Opelet_ (_Anthea cereus_).\r\n]\r\n\r\n“All the animals in this aquarium,” says Mr. Lloyd, “have to be fed\r\nconstantly; and as for the sea-anemones—of which there are in the\r\naquarium over 5,000 individuals—every one of them has a morsel of food\r\nproportioned to its size, and according to the condition of the water,\r\ngiven it at frequent intervals with a pair of wooden forceps by an\r\nattendant who makes this his sole occupation—as these flower-like\r\ncreatures, being so non-locomotive as to be almost absolutely fixed,\r\ncannot pursue their food, or in an aquarium obtain it in any other\r\nmanner. They are here deprived of the action of the waves, which in the\r\nactual ocean brings them nutriment, which is arrested by their outspread\r\nand waving tentacles. The food consumed by a few of the animals now\r\npresent in the aquarium is vegetable, consisting of green weeds (_Ulva_,\r\n_Porphyra_, _Enteromorpha_, _&c._), but by far the greater number have\r\nanimal food given them. This consists of shrimps, alive or dead, crabs,\r\nmussels, oysters, and fish, but they are never fed on butcher’s meat.”\r\n\r\nThe creatures known as “sea-anemones” are well represented in the\r\nCrystal Palace Aquarium. The observer cannot fail to be struck by their\r\nresemblance to flowers, from the radiated arrangement of their\r\ntentacles, and the beautiful colours they often exhibit. The opelet\r\n(_Anthea cereus_), Fig. 321, is perhaps the most beautiful among British\r\nspecies, and is a conspicuous denizen of the Aquarium, where its long\r\ngreen tentacles, tipped with lilac, are commonly seen expanded or\r\ntwisting about like so many snakes. These tentacles are stretched out in\r\nsearch of food, and when by chance an unlucky shrimp or other suitable\r\nprey merely touches a tentacle, it is seized and held with remarkable\r\npertinacity, the rest of the tentacles closing round it. The mouth of\r\nthe creature, placed in the centre of the disc, then expands to an\r\nextraordinary size, and the prey is quickly lodged in the capacious\r\ndigestive sac of the _actinia_, where the soft parts are soon dissolved,\r\nand the hard indigestible residue is ejected by the mouth. The tentacles\r\nof _Anthea_, and of other species belonging to the same subdivision of\r\nthe animal kingdom, are furnished with an immense multitude of curious\r\norgans, which consist of cells or minute bags, containing coiled up\r\nwithin them a slender highly elastic filament. When these cells are\r\ncompressed, the filament shoots out of its capsule to a surprising\r\nlength; and it has been supposed that the adhesive power of the\r\ntentacles depends upon these filiferous capsules; while it is not\r\nimprobable that some virulent fluid is also emitted from the cells, for\r\nthe victims appear as if paralysed almost as soon as they are seized.\r\nOur knowledge of these animals has been largely extended by the\r\nopportunities of observing their habits which are afforded by marine\r\naquaria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 322.—_The Viviparous Blenny_ (_Zoarces viviparus_).\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo obtain the variety of animals requisite for stocking a public\r\naquarium is by no means an easy matter; for the animals must be good\r\nspecimens, in a healthy condition, uninjured by their capture or\r\ntransport from the sea. The Crystal Palace Aquarium Company have at\r\nPlymouth a large pond, which communicates with the sea at every tide;\r\nand this, under the superintendence of the company’s resident agent,\r\nserves as a store for animals. Similar arrangements exist at Southend,\r\nWeymouth, Tenby, and other places. The specimens are brought to Sydenham\r\nby fast trains—special facilities being afforded by the railway\r\ncompanies for this purpose. The mode of carrying the animals depends\r\nupon their nature, and is sometimes a matter of no little difficulty.\r\nAll fishes, except perhaps eels and blennies, must be carried in a\r\nsufficient bulk of water; and then the due oxygenation of the water and\r\nthe removal of the carbonic acid can be but very imperfectly\r\naccomplished. A considerable mass of water is absolutely necessary in\r\nsuch cases, and the difficulties and cost of the transit are much\r\nincreased by its weight. In warm weather the quantity of oxygen retained\r\nin the water is materially diminished, and under such circumstances the\r\ncreatures would soon perish. On the other hand, in very cold weather the\r\ntemperature may be so far reduced below that suited to their habits that\r\ndeath may also result from this cause. Crabs, lobsters, sea-anemones,\r\nsea-urchins, and similar animals can in general be carried without being\r\nimmersed in a mass of water. These animals are placed in layers of wet\r\nsea-weed contained in baskets, so that the air has access to the\r\nmoisture which covers the bodies of the animals, which is prevented from\r\ndrying up by the humidity. As in this case the small quantity of water\r\nexposes a very large surface to the air, oxygen is plentifully supplied.\r\nMr. Lloyd points out that it is owing to the readiness with which mere\r\nfilms of water are aërated, that it has been found possible to convey to\r\nAustralia the eggs of salmon and trout, and hatch them there. They could\r\nnot have been carried in water, but they were successfully conveyed when\r\nsurrounded by a cool and very moist atmosphere. This mode of\r\ntransmission is much more economical and convenient than the plan of\r\ncarrying the creatures in water, and it is therefore resorted to\r\nwhenever the organization of the animal permits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 323.—_The Lancelet_ (_Amphioxus lanceolatus_).\r\n]\r\n\r\nSpecimens of a very remarkable creature are, or lately were, exhibited\r\nat this aquarium in the lancelet (_Amphioxus lanceolatus_), Fig. 323,\r\nwhich animal itself is a comparatively recent discovery. It is about 2½\r\nin. long, and although it is fish-like in form, it presents so many\r\npoints of structure common to lower animals, that it is looked upon by\r\nnaturalists as a link between the molluscs and the fishes—being the\r\nlowest of the latter in organization. The creature can hardly be said to\r\npossess a skeleton, the tissues representing that structure are so soft.\r\nIt has no definite brain, but it possesses olfactory and optic organs of\r\na rudimentary kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _THE BRIGHTON AQUARIUM._\r\n\r\nThe Brighton Aquarium, already so well known as a place of popular\r\nresort, is a structure of considerable architectural pretensions, and is\r\nthe largest establishment of the kind in existence. The idea of this\r\nundertaking appears to have originated with Mr. E. Birch, the engineer\r\nof the actual structure, who, having, in 1866, visited the aquarium at\r\nBoulogne, perceived that the construction at Brighton of a marine\r\naquarium on a very extended scale offered every promise of commercial\r\nsuccess. The promoters, in 1868, obtained from Parliament an act\r\nauthorizing them to acquire a certain site for the aquarium, but\r\nimposing such limits as to the height of the structure that it was\r\nnecessary to place the greater part of the building below the level of\r\nthe ground, a matter involving considerable engineering difficulties.\r\nThe aquarium is situated close to the Chain Pier and immediately below\r\nthe cliff, the building being protected from the waves by a strong\r\nsea-wall of concrete and Portland stone. The building was definitely\r\nopened in August, 1873, while the meeting of the British Association was\r\nbeing held in the town. Its length is no less than 715 ft., and its\r\naverage width 100 ft. The predominant element in the architectural style\r\nof the building is Italian. The following particulars as to the\r\narrangement and dimensions of the various parts of the building are\r\nderived from the official guide-book:\r\n\r\nEntering the gates at the western end, the visitor finds himself at the\r\ntop of a flight of granite steps leading to the entrance court, 60 ft.\r\nby 40 ft. The front elevation of the building is 18 ft. high, and\r\nconsists of five arches, with terra-cotta columns and enrichments. On\r\nthe frieze running round the sides are the appropriate words, “And God\r\nsaid, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that\r\nhath life.” On the northern side of the entrance court is the\r\nrestaurant; and on the southern side a series of niches ornamented with\r\nvases. From this outer court, the entrance hall, which is 80 ft. by 45\r\nft., is approached through three doors. This is furnished with\r\nreading-tables and supplied regularly with periodicals, journals, and\r\ntelegrams; while between the pillars supporting the roof are handsome\r\npedestals, surmounted with large glass vases containing the smaller\r\ninteresting marine and fresh-water animals, which would be lost to view\r\nin the larger tanks. In one of the recesses facing the entrance are four\r\nmicroscopes, in which specimens illustrative of subjects in natural\r\nhistory connected with the aquarium are constantly exhibited. To the\r\nnorth of the hall lie the general manager’s offices, the retiring-rooms,\r\nkitchen, &c.; and eastwards, in a direct line with the restaurant, is\r\nthe entrance to the western corridor of the aquarium proper. This\r\ncorridor, which contains a great many tanks, is the longest of any: it\r\nextends 220 ft., and is broken by a central vestibule, 55 ft. by 45 ft.\r\nThe roof, which is groined, is constructed of variegated bricks, and\r\nrests upon columns of Bath stone, polished serpentine marble, and\r\nAberdeen granite, the carved capitals of the columns having appropriate\r\nmarine subjects. On each side are placed the first two series of tanks,\r\ntwenty-one in number. These increase in dimensions from 11 ft. by 10 ft.\r\nupwards, the largest measuring over 100 ft. in length by 40 ft. in\r\nwidth, and holding 110,000 gallons of sea-water. This colossal tank is\r\nthe largest in the building, and is devoted to the exhibition of\r\nporpoises, turtles, and other animals of large size. The next largest\r\ntank, 50 ft. by 30 ft., is immediately opposite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 324.—_Sea-Horses_ (_Hippocampus brevirostris_).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe eastern end of the western corridor opens upon the conservatory,\r\nwhich serves as an approach to the rockwork, fernery, and picturesque\r\ncascade, and also to the eastern corridor. Some artificial rockwork,\r\nskirting the north side of the conservatory, is traversed by a stream of\r\nwater, broken up at intervals so as to form numerous little bays and\r\nponds, and utilized for the reception of seals and the larger reptilia.\r\nIn the side-space between the conservatory and the second or eastern\r\ncorridor are six octagonal table-tanks, of elegant design, for the\r\nexhibition of some of the smaller and more rare marine animals, and, at\r\nthe eastern extremity, apparatus which serves to illustrate the hatching\r\nand development of trout and salmon. The entire length of this second\r\ncorridor is about 160 ft., one side of the eastern portion, which is 90\r\nft. by 23 ft., being devoted to the exhibition of fresh-water animals.\r\nAt the end of the corridor are situated the curator’s offices and the\r\nnaturalists’ room, fitted with open tanks and all necessary appliances;\r\nand the engines, pumps, &c., for supplying the water, and keeping it\r\nconstantly aërated.\r\n\r\nThe system adopted for aërating the water at the Brighton Aquarium is\r\nquite different from that used at the Crystal Palace. In the former the\r\nwater is pumped directly from the sea into reservoirs formed under the\r\nfloors, and capable of holding 500,000 gallons, which can be filled in\r\nten hours. From these the water is pumped up into the tanks as required;\r\nbut there is no general circulation through the system of tanks and\r\nreservoirs. Each tank is treated independently, and its water is aërated\r\nand kept moving by the injection of air at the lower part, effected by\r\nsteam power.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the Brighton Aquarium may be judged of from the fact\r\nthat the average daily number of visitors is about 9,000, and that on\r\nsome occasions nearly twice that number pass the turnstiles. Among the\r\nspecialities of the establishment are herring and mackerel, which it has\r\nhitherto been considered impossible to preserve in confinement for any\r\nlength of time. They are now thriving well in the Aquarium, although\r\nthese fishes are both extremely impatient of confinement. The herring\r\nfeed readily upon small shrimps, in catching which they display a\r\nwonderful activity. Fig. 324 shows the curious fish called the\r\n“sea-horse” (_Hippocampus_), from the singular resemblance of the front\r\npart of the body to a horse’s head, or, at least, to that form which\r\nconventionally represents the “knight” among a set of chessmen. The tail\r\nof the creature is prehensile, and enables it to cling to sea-weeds and\r\nother bodies. The sea-horses have thriven well in the Brighton Aquarium,\r\nand also in that at the Crystal Palace. The latest novelties are the\r\n_Proteus_ from the dark caves of Adelsburg, axolotls from Mexico, the\r\nmud-fish (_Lepidosiren annectans_) from the Gambia, and the\r\ntelescope-fish from Shanghai. Some of these creatures are of great\r\ninterest from the circumstance of their forming the connecting-links\r\nbetween fishes and reptiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 325.—_Proteus anguinus._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are, therefore, now on view at the Brighton Aquarium specimens of\r\nthree species of animals possessing a high interest for naturalists and\r\nothers—not so much because their existence has been discovered in recent\r\ntimes, as because they are illustrations of the great law of gradation\r\nwhich exists in nature. Their position in the scale of organization is\r\nso intermediate between reptiles and fishes, that naturalists have not\r\nentirely agreed as to the kingdom to which these ought to be assigned.\r\nFig. 326 represents _Lepidosiren annectans_, which has gills covered by\r\nflaps, and not exposed as they are in ordinary amphibious animals; and\r\nis provided with four fins, or rudimentary legs, according as the reader\r\nmay choose to call them. The creature’s nostrils do not communicate with\r\nthe mouth, but are merely two blind sacs, as in fishes. The _Proteus\r\nanguinus_, shown in Fig. 325, is an eel-like creature, only met with in\r\nthe subterranean waters of the Grotto of the Maddalena at Adelsburg. It\r\nhas four imperfectly developed legs, and gills reduced to mere fringe,\r\nwhile there are lungs extending nearly the whole length of the abdomen.\r\nThe optical organs are entirely undeveloped, being represented merely by\r\ntwo specks. The axolotl, Fig. 327, inhabits certain Mexican lakes, and\r\nis remarkable for preserving, through the whole period of its life, the\r\ngills for aquatic respiration, which other _amphibia_ possess in the\r\ntadpole stage only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 326.—_The Mud-fish (Lepidosiren annectans)._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe mania for domestic aquaria which was at its height some years ago,\r\nand the great popularity of public marine aquaria wherever they are\r\nproperly managed, express the real interest which is felt in the varied\r\nforms of animal life, of which the aquarium affords the opportunity of\r\nobserving new and unknown phases. The progress of the science which\r\ntreats of the organization of the animal kingdom has made rapid strides\r\nduring the present century. Among the remarkable truths which have been\r\nacquired is the fact of the unity of the plan which pervades the animal\r\nkingdom. Each kind of animal has much in common with the kind above it,\r\nand with the kind below it: a certain community of organization pervades\r\nthe whole, which is knit into one by the gradational forms which may be\r\nobserved connecting, like links of a chain which cannot be broken, the\r\nmore defined modifications from each other. It is their position in the\r\nscale of organization which, in the eyes of the philosophic naturalist,\r\ngives so much interest to some of the forms of life which have been\r\nfigured above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 327.—_The Axolotl._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 328.—_Sorting, Washing, and Digging at the South African Alluvial\r\n    Diamond-Fields._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GOLD AND DIAMONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that gold and diamonds are named under nineteenth\r\ncentury discoveries in relation to the newly-found fields which have\r\nyielded these highly-prized substances in remarkable abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _GOLD._\r\n\r\nThis precious metal is met with in nearly all parts of the world, and\r\nits splendid colour, high lustre, the ease with which it may be wrought,\r\nand its property of ever remaining untarnished, have caused it to be\r\ngreatly esteemed for ornamental purposes from the earliest historical\r\nages. No doubt the store set upon gold is derived from its suitability\r\nfor decorative uses; and its comparative scarcity enhances the regard in\r\nwhich it is held. Its use, as a standard of value, is justified by the\r\ngeneral estimation in which it is held, and by the fact that the amount\r\nof labour required to obtain the metal is on the whole tolerably\r\nuniform. It is one of the few metals which are found in nature in the\r\nuncombined state, but its separation from the materials with which it is\r\nassociated requires the performance of a certain amount of work, in\r\nwhatever form the metal may occur. Its general distribution is another\r\nadvantage attending its selection as the standard of value. It occurs in\r\nEngland and Wales; in Spain, in France, in Hungary, in Piedmont, and in\r\nother parts of Europe; in various localities in Asia; in both divisions\r\nof the New World; in the remaining quarter of the globe, where it was\r\nobtained even in very ancient times, for South-East Africa was probably\r\nthe locality to which a naval expedition was despatched by King\r\nSolomon—“they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold.” Australia\r\nalso has, in the last half of our century, yielded much gold.\r\n\r\nGold is never met with in regular veins, but in primitive or igneous\r\nrocks, or in deposits formed by the disintegration of these. In\r\nAustralia the metal is associated with quartz, in slate rocks\r\ngeologically equivalent to the Cambrian formations of England and Wales;\r\nand in California it is also chiefly found in material which has been\r\nformed by the wearing down of quartz and granite rocks. Before the\r\ndiscoveries in California and Australia most of the gold in circulation\r\nwas obtained from auriferous iron pyrites. The first finding of gold in\r\nCalifornia occurred in September, 1847, when a Mr. Marshall, the\r\nproprietor of a saw-mill on the Sacramento River, observed some\r\nglistening grains among the sand in his mill-race. The news soon spread,\r\nand the inhabitants of the town of San Francisco, then numbering about\r\ntwo hundred persons, were greatly excited thereby. When it became known\r\nthat gold was really to be found, multitudes flocked to California, the\r\npopulation of San Francisco rapidly increased, and at the present day\r\nthe city contains nearly a thousand times as many inhabitants as it did\r\nat the time gold was first discovered. The annual value of the metal\r\nfound in California averaged about £23,000,000 for ten years after 1851;\r\nbut this subsequently declined to less than half in 1872.\r\n\r\nSir Roderick Murchison, the distinguished geologist, pointed out the\r\ngreat probability of the existence of gold in Australia many years\r\nbefore the precious metal was actually found. It has, however, been\r\nstated that gold was met with in Australia so long ago as 1788.\r\nConsidering the mode in which the metal occurs, it seems strange that\r\nthe emigrants who occupied the auriferous districts as agriculturists\r\ndid not long ago discover the riches which Nature had scattered over the\r\nsurface of the soil. No doubt, their attention was too much devoted to\r\ntheir sheep and cattle to notice the glittering particles which might be\r\nseen in the water-courses, and it would probably never enter their minds\r\nthat the eagerly desired metal could lie exposed to view on the surface\r\nof the land. But the announcement of the discoveries in California\r\ninduced men to look at the soil more attentively, and in April, 1851,\r\nMr. Hargreaves appears to have found at Bathurst the first gold met with\r\nin Australia. Four months afterwards the metal was also picked up at\r\nBallarat, Victoria, and the gold-fields so discovered proved even richer\r\nthan those of Sydney.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this discovery on the colony of Victoria proved\r\nmarvellous. The population, which in 1851 was 77,000, had in 1867 become\r\n660,000; in the same period the land under cultivation expanded from\r\n57,000 acres to 631,000, and the value of property rose enormously when\r\nthe grazier’s estimate of its worth was replaced by that of the miner.\r\nThe authorities of the colony from the first regulated the mining\r\noperations by enactments defining the rights of the miners to the\r\n“claims,” as the allotments of land for working upon are termed; and\r\nthus disorder and lawlessness were almost unknown. Fig. 329 will give\r\nthe reader a notion of the appearance of a miners’ settlement in the\r\nAustralian gold-fields in the earlier period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 329.—_Gold Miners’ Camp._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental rocks in the colony of Victoria belong to the oldest\r\nseries of strata. They answer to the Silurian formation which exists in\r\nCumberland, Wales, and Scotland. Although the strata of the rocks are\r\nmuch bent, and they have been worn down by the action of water, they are\r\nas a whole but little altered, consisting chiefly of sandstones and\r\nshales. These strata are interpenetrated by innumerable veins of quartz,\r\nwhich vary in thickness from 1/16 in. to 150 ft. It is in these quartz\r\nveins that the gold is seen in its original matrix. The metal is\r\nsometimes in the form of grains or flakes, or in moss-like threads,\r\nembedded in the quartz; sometimes in the form of well-defined crystals,\r\nsometimes in rough lumps or _nuggets_. Fig. 330 shows three of the\r\nvarious modes in which the gold is found disseminated through quartz.\r\nOverlying the more ancient rocks with their auriferous quartz veins are\r\nvarious rocks of different ages; and as these have been in part formed\r\nby the wearing down of the older rocks, they also are in general\r\nauriferous, and contain the gold in detached pieces, varying in size\r\nfrom particles of fine dust to the huge nugget, containing 2,280 oz., or\r\nnearly £10,000 worth of pure gold, which was found at Dunolly.\r\n\r\nThe soil, which has been formed by the disintegration of masses of\r\nauriferous quartz, is full of gold, so that a patch of such soil 12 ft.\r\nsquare has been known to yield 30 oz. of gold by a very rough kind of\r\nwashing to the depth of 1 ft. Soil of this kind has been carried down by\r\nrivers and streams ages ago; and the lighter particles having been\r\ncarried off by the water, while the gold, from its greater specific\r\ngravity, remained at the bottom of the stream, the sands and gravel of\r\nthese river-beds are very rich in gold. In many instances the ancient\r\nwater-courses have been entirely covered by igneous rocks, such as\r\nbasalt, which have flowed over the land in a molten state. The\r\ngold-miner often finds his reward in burrowing beneath these basalts and\r\nlavas, following the bed of the ancient river, and recovering its\r\nlong-buried treasures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 330.—_Gold in Rocks._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 331.—_“Cradle” for Gold-washing._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe methods of carrying on the gold-seeking operations vary according to\r\nthe nature of the deposit which is worked and the resources of the\r\nminer. The simplest, which was that most practised in the early days of\r\nthe gold-fields, consists in throwing into a tub several shovelsful of\r\nthe surface soil, and in pouring in water while the contents of the tub\r\nare stirred about with a spade. The lighter matters are washed away, but\r\nthe gold by its great specific gravity remains behind. An improvement in\r\nthis, but still a very rude process, is practised by aid of the\r\n_cradle_, Fig. 331, which is merely the trunk of a tree, hollowed out,\r\nand provided with transverse partitions and ribs. The auriferous earth\r\nis thrown into the upper compartment, which is then filled with water.\r\nThe cradle is rocked, so that the water may wash away all but the gold\r\nand the heavy stones. Any particles of the former which may be carried\r\nout of the head of the cradle will be stopped by the ribs which cross\r\nthe lower part. Machines for puddling by horse-power are now in use, and\r\nother contrivances have superseded the tub and the cradle in\r\n_surface-washing_. The auriferous earth obtained by excavating the soil\r\nfrom pits is washed in a similar manner, as is also the material reached\r\nby penetrating the deeper tertiary deposits, and by driving adits or\r\ntunnels along the ancient river-beds beneath the layers of basalt.\r\n\r\nA mode of washing accumulations of auriferous earths by streams of water\r\nis employed where circumstances are favourable. A long inclined channel\r\nis constructed, and lined with boards; or, when the natural inclination\r\nof the soil requires it, a long trough is constructed and supported on\r\ntrestles. The trough is made of sawn boards, 1½ in. thick, in sections\r\n12 ft. long, and it has a width of about 1 ft., the sides being from 8\r\nin. to 2 ft. high. The inclination of the troughs is from 8 in. to 24\r\nin. in 12 ft., and depends upon the abundance of the water: the more\r\nwater, the steeper is the slope. The bottoms of the troughs are crossed\r\nby a number of transverse bars, which arrest the auriferous particles in\r\ntheir descent. The _sluice_, or series of troughs, may be from 50 ft. to\r\nseveral hundreds or even thousands of feet in length, and the cost from\r\n£100 to £8,000. The earth is thrown in at the upper part of the trough,\r\nand it is gradually washed down, the water being allowed to flow in some\r\ncases by night as well as by day, but commonly in the day-time only, as\r\nthe troughs must be watched, to see that they do not become choked up,\r\nand the soil washed out by the overflowing water. The _run_ goes on for\r\nsix or ten days, and then the current is stopped for a _cleaning-up_,\r\nwhich occupies from half a day to a day. For this operation the stream\r\nof water is stopped, and quicksilver is used to dissolve the grains of\r\ngold from the sand, &c., collected by the _riffle-bars_. The quicksilver\r\nis afterwards expelled from the amalgam by heat, and the gold remains as\r\na porous mass.\r\n\r\nSometimes, instead of shovelling the earth into the troughs, it can be\r\nwashed out of its position into suitable channels by means of a powerful\r\njet of water. This mode of working, which is termed _hydraulic jet\r\nsluicing_, offers great advantages where the natural conditions admit of\r\nits adoption. In this plan, instead of bringing the auriferous earth to\r\nthe water, the water is brought to the earth by a flexible pipe, like\r\nthe hose of a fire-engine, from a reservoir about 200 ft. higher, and\r\nthe stream is directed upon the material by a nozzle. This powerful jet\r\nof water is used to separate and carry away the earth to the head of a\r\nsystem of channels and troughs, like those already described. The hose\r\nhas a diameter of 8 in., but the orifice of the nozzle from which the\r\nwater issues is contracted, in order to increase the force of the jet.\r\nThe hydraulic jet sluicing requires from three to six men to work it,\r\nand the material of a hill can be carried into the sluices in less time\r\nthan a hundred persons could do it by spades. Immense quantities of\r\nearth are removed in this way, and fatal accidents are not infrequent\r\nfrom the falling masses burying the men who carry the pipe. The force of\r\nthe jet of water itself is another source of danger, for broken limbs\r\nand even fatal injuries have often been caused by it. The number of\r\naccidental deaths occurring in hydraulic jet sluicing operations in the\r\ncolony of Victoria is reported to average about 60 in a year. Material\r\nwhich has been worked before often yields a considerable amount of gold\r\nwhen the operations are repeated; and in localities favourable to the\r\nhydraulic jet system, the work can be carried on with little labour. In\r\nthis way three men have been known to extract in one week from dirt\r\nwashed for the third time, gold of the value of £330.\r\n\r\nThe gold which is embedded in quartz and other minerals, as shown in\r\nFig. 330, is obtained by crushing the material in stamping machines,\r\nwhich are usually constructed with logs of wood shod with iron. In\r\nanother form of crushing-mill two large cast-iron rollers are used\r\ninstead of stampers. From the crushed material the particles of gold are\r\nextracted by amalgamation with mercury, which is afterwards removed by\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nThe richness of the Victoria gold-fields may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat, up to the year 1868, 36,835,692 oz. had been obtained, the value\r\nof which is no less than £147,342,767. The total value of the gold then\r\nannually obtained throughout the whole world is estimated at about 20\r\nmillions of pounds sterling. When gold was found so plentifully in\r\nCalifornia and Australia, it was supposed by some that its value as a\r\nmonetary standard would be affected. This has not happened, although the\r\nprices obtained for the metal by its producers were considerably lower\r\nin the last decade of the century than about 1867. The total annual\r\noutput of gold throughout the world is of course variable, and no doubt\r\nthere are also variations in the demand; but, so far, the fluctuations\r\nhave been relatively small, and there has been no such depreciation by\r\nexcess of production as in the case of silver. Yet the increased\r\nproduction of gold after the discoveries made about the middle of the\r\ncentury was beyond precedent. It has been estimated that between 1850\r\nand 1875 the total value amounted to £600,000,000, showing an annual\r\naverage twelve times greater than that for the period between 1700 and\r\n1850. Between 1875 and 1890 there was a falling off in the supply, the\r\nannual average becoming only £20,000,000 in value. But since the\r\nlast-named date there has been a rise year by year, and at the close of\r\nthe century the value of the gold produced throughout the world in one\r\nyear may not be less than £40,000,000.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, the distribution of gold is world-wide; and it has\r\nhappened in recent times, that just as one source of supply has shown\r\nsigns of failure, other fields have been discovered and have attracted\r\nthousands of eager seekers to new regions. So, when the Californian\r\nsupply was falling off, there came the rush to Australia, where easily\r\nworked alluvial deposits or rich veins continued for years to reward the\r\ntoil of the gold-finder, though in an ever-lessening degree, until in\r\n1886 or 1887 the centre of attraction was shifted. But at a later period\r\nfresh discoveries in Australia again raised the productiveness of that\r\nquarter; and still more recently, the announcement of the existence of\r\nmuch auriferous deposit in the valley of the Yukon River (Klondyke), and\r\nin various localities of British Columbia, drew thousands to desolate\r\nand undeveloped districts, in spite of the extremities of hardship and\r\ndestitution that might be endured.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of 1886 takes us to South Africa, a region with which also\r\nour next section is mainly concerned, and the scene of an activity\r\nunprecedented in the annals of gold-mining. From circumstances\r\nimmediately connected with our present subject, the close of our century\r\nfinds public attention intensely occupied with affairs at the austral\r\nextremity of the “dark continent.” The history of South Africa, from the\r\ntime when, in 1486, the tempest-driven Portuguese mariner, Bartholomew\r\nDiaz, first struck its shores at the promontory he named the “Cape of\r\nStorms” (_Cabo Tormentoso_), and when, eleven years afterwards, the\r\ncelebrated Vasco de Gama sailed round it on his memorable voyage to\r\nIndia, is one which, in many respects, presents features of peculiar\r\ninterest. It is not our province to enter into details of these, but it\r\nmay be stated that the “Cape of Good Hope”—the more auspicious\r\ndesignation which the King of Portugal substituted for that of Diaz—was,\r\ntowards the end of the seventeenth century, colonized by Dutch and some\r\nFrench settlers, and afterwards Table Bay became a regular port of call\r\nfor Dutch, English, and other ships trading to India. The Cape was taken\r\npossession of by the British in 1795, but restored to the Dutch in 1803,\r\nonly to be three years after (1806) resumed by England, under whose rule\r\n“Cape Colony” has since remained. The abolition of slavery in all\r\nBritish dominions, enacted in 1833, was the occasion of great\r\ndissatisfaction to the descendants of the Dutch settlers, who inhabited\r\nisolated farmsteads, their possessions consisting chiefly of great herds\r\nof cattle, tended by slaves. These people, or at least the majority of\r\nthem, resolved to quit the confines of British territory, and seek fresh\r\nfields and pastures new in unoccupied regions north of the Orange River,\r\nso that from 1835 to 1838 there was a continued “exodus of the emigrant\r\nfarmers.” The story of the following years, with its exciting events and\r\nthe vacillating policy of successive British Governments, must be\r\nperused elsewhere: suffice it to say here, that the settlements of the\r\n“emigrant farmers” had by 1854 established themselves into two separate\r\nStates, nominally recognising Great Britain as the “paramount power,”\r\nbut practically independent of it; for, at the last-named date, the\r\nautonomy of “The Orange River Free State” was acknowledged, and two\r\nyears before that another section of the Boers, _i.e._ of the “emigrant\r\nfarmers,” who had settled beyond the Vaal River, was absolved from\r\nBritish allegiance, and, restricted only by a claim of certain suzerain\r\npowers, was constituted into “The South African Republic,” of which the\r\nprecise boundaries were at length determined by the “Convention of\r\nLondon” in 1884. This territory is usually called for shortness the\r\n_Transvaal_, and here in 1854 the existence of gold was first announced;\r\nbut the Boer authorities at once prohibited further prospecting,\r\nfearing, and perhaps with reason, that the winning of the precious metal\r\nwithin their bounds might disturb their pastoral quietude. The Boer\r\ncharacter has been the unique product of a race withdrawn for two\r\ncenturies from contact with European and civilized culture, living in\r\nwidely separated dwellings with scarcely other associations than cattle\r\nand enslaved blacks. The Boer is described as of a type which draws away\r\nfrom the enterprising man of modern times towards the primitive\r\npatriarch centred in his flocks and herds: he hates innovations, and\r\ngreatly distrusts strangers; he would rather keep, in a box under his\r\nbed, any money he may possess than employ it, or his own energies, in\r\ndeveloping the immense mineral resources of his territory, in which are\r\nincluded not only gold, but copper, silver, lead, iron, and abundance of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nAfter some years the prohibition against the exploitation of gold in the\r\nTransvaal was withdrawn, and several localities in the Republic\r\nsubsequently became small capitals of gold-mining industry. The most\r\nnotable were Leydenburg and Barberton, at which latter place as many as\r\n10,000 gold-seekers were congregated when the discovery of 1886 drew\r\nmost of them away. These communities were formed almost entirely by the\r\ninflux of people from beyond the Boer boundaries, mainly, of course,\r\nEnglish-speaking people from the Cape Colony, Australia, America, etc.\r\nTheir operations were hampered by the Transvaal legislation, and impeded\r\nby the absence of adequate means of communication, which was a\r\ncharacteristic feature of the Boers’ unprogressiveness; nevertheless,\r\ngold-mining has been pursued in some of these localities ever since,\r\nthough with varying fortune. What drew nearly all the gold-seekers of\r\nthe Transvaal and of adjoining regions at once to the north side of the\r\nVaal River was the discovery there of _real gold mines_. This was at a\r\ndistrict within the Transvaal territory, named Witwatersrandt (=\r\nWhite-waters-ridge), the designation which has been reduced by\r\nabbreviation or affection to “The Randt”—or, _anglice_, the Rand.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that although the Randt district had been explored by\r\nexpert prospectors between 1877 and 1891, the outcrops of the auriferous\r\nreefs entirely escaped their notice. But when the first hint of the\r\nexistence of these deposits was bruited abroad, it was the Kimberley men\r\nwho were foremost in surveying the spot. By the Kimberley men we mean\r\nthose who so soon had by lucky chance lighted in 1870 upon the rich and\r\napparently inexhaustible diamond mines, as related in our next section.\r\nBy the time of the announcement of gold-finds on the north side of the\r\nVaal River many of these men had become rich—very rich indeed. If they\r\nhad been so disposed they might then have returned to their native\r\ncountries with enviable fortunes, but it was just as the affairs of\r\ntheir diamond companies had been settled by consolidation on a\r\nsatisfactory basis, and the spirit of discovery and adventure was still\r\nstrong upon them, that they resolved personally to explore the new El\r\nDorado. To a wild desolate region they proceeded, enduring there and on\r\nthe track thither the like discomforts they had experienced in their\r\nearlier quest. But they took with them experts provided with all\r\nappliances for ascertaining the prospective value of the alleged\r\ndiscovery, and, when convinced of its reality, they purchased from the\r\nBoer possessors their land at the price demanded, and it was not long\r\nbefore they had chemists and engineers at work, having, at the cost of\r\nmaking their own roads, had brought to the spot the necessary machinery\r\nand appliances. The usual influx of workers, builders, speculators,\r\netc., followed, and in a wonderfully short space of time a town sprang\r\nup where in 1886 there had been only a single poor farm. The town grew\r\nrapidly to the dimensions of a city inhabited by 150,000 people. Its\r\nname is Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nIn his book on South Africa, the late Lord Randolph Churchill,\r\ndescribing Johannesburg in 1891, says that it has much of the appearance\r\nof an English manufacturing town, but without noise, smoke, or dirt.\r\n“The streets are crowded with a busy, bustling, active, keen,\r\nintelligent-looking throng. There are gathered together human beings\r\nfrom every quarter of the globe, the English possessing an immense\r\npredominance. The buildings and general architecture of the town attain\r\nan excellent standard, style having been consulted and sought after,\r\nstone and bricks the materials, corrugated iron being confined to the\r\nroofs, solidity, permanence, and progress being the general\r\ncharacteristics.”\r\n\r\nThe Randt mines having drawn into the South African Republic great\r\nnumbers of enterprising workers, who have acquired wealth and built\r\ncities, it would have been expected that they would have been permitted\r\nto acquire the ordinary rights of citizenship. The Boers’ character,\r\nhowever, has been manifested by their refusal of such rights, and by\r\ntheir exacting grievous imposts from these _Uitlanders_ (Out-landers, or\r\nstrangers), who, being for the most part of English race, are finding\r\nthe injustice too hard to be borne, and greatly strained relations\r\nbetween the Transvaal and Great Britain have again supervened. Indeed,\r\nthe situation has become so serious that it is feared actual war may\r\nresult, and that is why, in almost the last year of our century, people\r\nare looking anxiously at the position of affairs in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe geological conditions of the Randt are these: the upper series of\r\nbeds in the _Karoo formation_, which extends over the greater part of\r\nSouth Africa, consist of quartzose strata, and in the district in\r\nquestion these are much broken, faulted, and variously inclined. They\r\nare interstratified with beds of sandstone and with the layers of\r\ngold-bearing conglomerate, of which last there are several parallel to\r\none another and not far separated, ranging in their several thicknesses\r\nfrom 6 inches to 6 feet, the thickest being known as the main reef.\r\nThese reefs form an oval basin,—that is, they dip with varying angle\r\ntowards a centre, and crop out at their up-turned edges. Johannesburg is\r\nsituated nearly 6,000 feet above the sea-level, on an elevated ridge,\r\nalong which for 30 miles east, and nearly the same westwards, the\r\nnorthern outcrop extends, curving towards the south, while the southern\r\nedge of the basin appears in the Orange Free State, where it has been\r\ntraced for a distance of 130 miles. There a shaft, sunk to the great\r\ndepth of 2,400 feet, found the main reef with undiminished richness. The\r\noutcrop of the reefs stretches east and west for 130 miles, and the\r\ndistance between north and south is 30 miles. From such data it has been\r\ninferred that the reefs contain altogether not less than 450 million\r\npounds worth of gold. The conglomerate of these reefs consists of\r\nrounded quartz pebbles (which contain no gold), and pieces of sandstone\r\nand of argillaceous material, the whole cemented together into a very\r\nhard mass by iron pyrites. This last is the matrix in which the gold\r\nexists, in the form, for the most part, of minute scarcely visible\r\ncrystals. To a depth of from 50 to 150 feet, air and moisture have acted\r\non the pyritic matter, and the material of the reef becoming in\r\nconsequence easily disintegrated, has yielded by mere mechanical\r\ntreatment most of its gold, whereas by the same operations on the\r\nunderlying hard, tough conglomerate, only about half its gold could be\r\nobtained. Hence, after breaking up the ore, the pyritic matter is sorted\r\nout and transported to the stamp battery, reduced to powder, from which\r\nabout five-eighths of the contained gold is removed by quicksilver. The\r\nresidue is concentrated by washing in a special machine called the “Frue\r\nvanner,” and the _concentrates_, after roasting in order to oxidize base\r\nmetals, are subjected to the action of chlorine gas, by which the gold\r\nis converted into a soluble chloride, from the solution of which it is\r\nprecipitated by ferrous sulphate. The _tailings_, _slimes_, and other\r\nresidues are further acted on by a solution of potassium cyanide, which\r\ndissolves the minute remaining particles of gold, and from the solution\r\nthe metal is obtained by electrolysis. By these supplementary chemical\r\nprocesses the total of the gold recovered from the ore is raised to 90\r\nper cent. or more of all that chemical analysis shows to exist.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that the reefs are arranged in a basin-like form, it\r\nmust be understood that this applies to their general disposition, for\r\nthe regularity of geometrical shape does not belong to geological\r\nbasins. There are considerable variations in the inclinations of the\r\nreefs: at some places they are nearly vertical, but generally they dip\r\ntowards the centre at various angles, a slope between 25° and 45° being\r\nquite usual; and the inclination becomes less and less the deeper they\r\ngo, so that it is presumed that the beds are level towards the centre of\r\nthe basin. In the Randt the vertical shaft is rather the exception, the\r\nentrance to the mine usually following the inclination of the reefs, and\r\nthe trucks of ore are drawn up sloping rails. From the inclined adits\r\nhorizontal galleries are excavated right and left at various depths by\r\nwhich the main reef is worked, and there are cross cuts by which the\r\nreefs to the north and south may be reached. The most active district of\r\nthe Randt is that which extends eastward of Johannesburg, where a long\r\nsuccession of tall chimneys and winding headgears together with the\r\nother appurtenances are visible. But there is nothing of a picturesque\r\ncharacter about a gold mine, more than is presented by the aspect of an\r\nordinary colliery.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Randt gold-fields does not consist in the actual\r\nrichness of the crude material, which indeed in places here and there\r\ncannot be profitably worked,—in mining parlance, it is not “pay ore.” It\r\nis rather the great ascertained extent of these gold-bearing beds and\r\nthe general persistence of their character throughout that give to the\r\nRandt its unique character amongst metalliferous workings. This\r\ncontrasts with the comparative uncertainty attending the exploitation of\r\nauriferous quartz veins, which occur in detached unconnected patches,\r\nthat often end suddenly where least expected. There are in the Randt\r\nnearly one hundred companies working mines, and of these there are many\r\nthat pay very handsome dividends on their original capital. A few pay\r\n100 per cent., while a considerable number distribute 25 per cent. and\r\nupwards; so that some of these Gold Companies are amongst the richest\r\nand most influential financial houses in the world. The Randt is second\r\nonly to the United States in the quantity it adds annually to the\r\nworld’s production.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _DIAMONDS._\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, and down to a comparatively late period, the only\r\nregion from which were derived all the diamonds that found their way to\r\nEurope, was India, where Golconda was long celebrated for the productive\r\nmines in its neighbourhood, and for the high estimation in which fine\r\nspecimens of their yield were held. In the seventeenth century these\r\nmines employed 60,000 persons, it is said; and in other districts of\r\nIndia diamond-seeking has also been carried on from time immemorial. A\r\ngradual decrease in the finds of Indian diamonds has long been observed,\r\nand the supremacy the East had so long enjoyed as the purveyor of gems\r\nwas in the earlier part of the eighteenth century transferred to another\r\nhemisphere. In 1727 the diamond was first discovered in Brazil; or\r\nrather, we might say, was then first discerned there. For the\r\ngold-seekers in washing the sands of certain Brazilian rivers had found\r\nnumberless specimens which they either threw aside as worthless, or,\r\nseeing them prettier pebbles than the rest, used them as counters in\r\ntheir card games; their true nature was not recognized, because the\r\nrough diamond has by no means the attractive appearance of the cut and\r\npolished brilliant flashing with refractive radiance. It must have been\r\nthese last, and not diamonds in their natural state, that presented\r\nthemselves to the imagination of the poet when he penned the line—\r\n\r\n              Or deep with diamonds in the _flaming_ mine.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of some diamonds having been found in America had no\r\neffect on the prices in the Indian market, but the exports that soon\r\nafter came from Brazil in great abundance quite changed the conditions\r\nof the trade, for in the first fifty years their value was estimated at\r\nno less than £12,000,000 sterling. As already stated, the presence of\r\ndiamonds in Brazil was not recognized until 1727, and then by the\r\naccident of one Lobo, an inhabitant of the gold district of Minas\r\nGeräes, who had been in India and had seen rough diamonds there,\r\nobserving the resemblance; he took some of the Brazilian stones to\r\nLisbon, where their identity with the products of the Indian mines was\r\nestablished. But the European dealers, alarmed lest this discovery\r\nshould depreciate the value of their stocks of Indian gems, spread a\r\nreport that the so-called diamonds from Brazil were but the refuse of\r\nthe Indian mines that had been sent to Brazil. This had the effect of\r\nstopping for a time the sale of the Brazilian diamonds; but the traders\r\nin these were not above taking a hint from their rivals—_fas est et ab\r\nhoste doceri_—for they carried their diamonds to Bengal, and there sold\r\nthem as Indian stones at Indian prices. For nearly one hundred and forty\r\nyears after this Brazil was by far the most productive diamond region in\r\nthe whole world, and especially after 1754, when diamond-seekers\r\ncongregated by thousands in the very rich fields of Bahia, a district of\r\nBrazil. Nor have the places above mentioned been by any means the only\r\nlocalities in Brazil where diamond-finders have been at work; but the\r\nproduction has decreased and has lost its relative importance by the\r\nSouth African discoveries that about 1870 caused an entire change in the\r\ndiamond industry, and the high prices of the Brazilian gems no longer\r\ncapable of being maintained, the fall in value has rendered the workings\r\nless remunerative than formerly. We may now pass over with mere mention,\r\ndiscoveries of diamondiferous districts in North America, Australia, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhile rejecting as entirely inapplicable and inexcusable by any stretch\r\nof poetic licence the epithet _flaming_ for the diamond mine, we must\r\nquestion whether the word _mine_, that as the customary word we have\r\ncontinued to use, does not convey an equally false notion of the nature\r\nof the workings to which hitherto reference has been made. For these in\r\nmost cases are nothing more than holes, very much like gravel pits in\r\nthe side of a hill. The diamonds which have so far been in question are\r\nusually found among alluvial sands or gravels, the water-worn fragments\r\nof disintegrated rocks. These are in many cases carried down by rivers,\r\nand the diamonds under such circumstances are very frequently\r\naccompanied by gold; indeed, it is the search for gold that has in many\r\ncases led to their discovery. In the dry season of the year, which\r\nextends from April to October, the lessened currents of certain of the\r\nBrazilian streams are diverted from their course into canals, so as to\r\nleave dry the bed of the stream, and here the mud is dug out to the\r\ndepth of six or eight feet or more, and transported near the washing\r\nhuts, these operations being continued throughout the dry season. When\r\nthis is over the digging is necessarily interrupted by great volumes of\r\nwater that fill the rivers and streams, and the diamond-seekers devote\r\ntheir attention to washing the mud that has been collected. About one\r\ncwt. of this is placed in a long trough, and water is made to flow in,\r\nwhile the negro labourer stirs up the mass with his hands, until the\r\nwater runs off clear, all the particles of mud having been washed away.\r\nThe residual gravel is then very carefully examined, stone by stone, and\r\nany diamonds found are handed to the overseer, who watches all\r\nproceedings from an elevated seat. These Brazilian diamonds are mostly\r\nof a small size: occasionally, but very rarely, stones of quite\r\nexceptional value are found, but perhaps not one in 10,000. Formerly\r\nwhen in the Brazilian fields a negro slave found one of 18 carats, or\r\nmore (18 carats = 72 grains), he not only obtained his freedom, but was\r\nrewarded with gifts, and for the finding of smaller stones commensurate\r\nrewards were given. The value of a diamond of the larger sizes depends\r\nupon so many adventitious circumstances that it would not be easy for\r\nany one to state the money’s worth of an 18–carat stone, but,\r\nconsidering too that the price increases in a more rapid ratio than the\r\nweight, we may to some extent draw an inference from the published\r\nvalues in 1867 of smaller Brazilian brilliants, perfectly white, pure,\r\nand flawless, when one of 5 carats (20 grains) in weight was priced at\r\n£350. As the rough diamond gives a brilliant of only half its weight, we\r\nmay from the above assume an 18–carat stone to be worth in its finished\r\nstate at least £1,000.\r\n\r\nIt may well be asked what are the qualities possessed by the diamond\r\nwhich have caused it to be so highly valued as an adornment all the\r\nworld over; and here it will be proper to invite the reader’s attention\r\nto the chemical as well as to the physical character of the diamond. The\r\nmost obvious and attractive quality of the cut brilliant is its\r\nunsurpassable lustre, which is due to its high refractive power. In a\r\nsection of our article on light the subject of refraction has been dealt\r\nwith, and an explanation given of the _index of refraction_. That of the\r\ndiamond is the highest known, being 2·50 to 2·75; other precious stones\r\nhave indices ranging from 1·58 to 1·78; those of glass and of quartz are\r\nbetween 1·50 and 1·57. It follows from the known laws of refraction that\r\nthe _limiting_ or critical angle is less for diamond than for other\r\nsubstances, as, for example, glass, for the posterior surface of a\r\ndiamond will totally reflect all the light that falls upon it at any\r\nangle with the normal greater than 24°; glass will totally reflect only\r\nwhen the incidence is greater than about 42°: hence the diamond reflects\r\nfrom its farther surface about 64 per cent. of rays that glass similarly\r\nsituated would allow to pass outwards without reflection.\r\n\r\nAnother property in which the diamond excels all other substances is\r\nhardness. It is the hardest substance in nature; for a diamond will\r\n_scratch_ every other, but by none can it be _scratched_, except by\r\nanother diamond. Not but that by the application of a file the edges of\r\na diamond or brilliant may be notched and broken; but this would be\r\nthrough sheer mechanical force tearing the substance, and would be a\r\ntest of _brittleness_, not of _hardness_. These two properties have not\r\nunfrequently been confounded, as when it was foolishly prescribed as a\r\ntest for the genuineness of a diamond, that it should be placed on an\r\nanvil and struck with a hammer. No doubt many good and valuable stones\r\nhave been sacrificed by this ignorant treatment. The hardness of the\r\ndiamond does not prevent its being reducible to powder when so required.\r\nAgain, diamonds are sometimes in such a condition of internal strain\r\nthat very slight shocks are sufficient to cause them to separate into\r\nfragments. We read of diamonds that are suspected to be in this\r\ncondition being packed for transmission within raw potatoes. The extreme\r\nhardness of the diamond secures it from all those accidental abrasions\r\nand injuries to which softer materials are liable, so that it does not\r\ndeteriorate by age or use. It is unaffected also by any chemical\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nIn chemical composition the diamond is pure carbon, one of the most\r\ncommonly diffused of the elementary bodies, as it enters into the\r\nconstitution of the atmosphere, of all organic bodies, and of a vast\r\nnumber of mineral substances. Carbon in a less pure form also occurs\r\nnaturally as _graphite_, _plumbago_ or _black lead_, and in other\r\nconditions comes into ordinary use as already explained in our article\r\non Iron. It was only towards the end of the eighteenth century that the\r\ncomposition of the diamond was demonstrated by the celebrated French\r\nchemist, Lavoisier, who actually burnt a diamond in oxygen gas, and\r\nfound the resulting product to be carbonic acid gas, identical with that\r\nobtained by similarly burning a piece of charcoal. Soon afterwards\r\nanother French chemist, Clouet, confirmed Lavoisier’s conclusion by\r\nproducing _steel_ from pure iron and diamond heated together, an\r\nexperiment of much significance when considered in the light of the\r\nremarkable relation between these substances, which is one of the latest\r\ndiscoveries of our century. It should be observed that Clouet’s result\r\nimplies a fusion of the diamond as well as of the iron in the act of\r\nentering into chemical combination.\r\n\r\nLike nearly every solid substance of definite chemical composition, this\r\npure carbon takes the crystalline form. The phenomena of crystallization\r\nare of the highest interest and beauty, for in them we see shapeless\r\nmatter fashioning itself into definite and often perfect geometrical\r\nsolids, as if it had been wrought by the hand of some mathematical\r\nartist. Every substance forms crystals of some one shape when the\r\nconditions are identical, and one essential condition for any\r\ncrystallization is that the particles should be capable of free movement\r\nin arranging themselves, and this condition can occur only when the\r\nsubstance is in the state of liquid or of gas. Crystals are commonly\r\ndeposited from solutions when the solvent evaporates or is cooled down;\r\nor they are formed when a fused substance solidifies. In either case the\r\ncrystals are the larger and more perfect as they are allowed the greater\r\ntime to form. Now, carbon in any of its conditions has been found to be\r\nabsolutely infusible and insoluble, and therefore the origin of the\r\ndiamond has long been a puzzle to scientific men, very diverse surmises\r\nhaving been propounded on this subject. Some have thought it was\r\nseparated from carbonic acid by the action of heat, or of electricity;\r\nothers, that the carbon had been gasified by subterranean heat; others,\r\namong whom were Newton and the German chemist, Liebig, believed that\r\nheat had nothing to do with it, but that the crystals slowly separated\r\nfrom vegetable matters (hydro-carbons) in the process of decomposition\r\nunder some unknown conditions; others, that the diamond crystallized out\r\nfrom liquid carbonic acid, holding under pressure some unknown form of\r\ncarbon in solution; others, that carbon was ejected by volcanic action\r\nin a fused state; and so on. We hope to show that the problem has at\r\nlength been solved, and how.\r\n\r\nThe shapes of the natural crystals of the diamond must not be confounded\r\nwith those of the cut brilliants. The most frequently met with of the\r\nformer is the octahedron, or eight-sided figure, such as would result\r\nfrom two square pyramids joined base to base, the triangles forming the\r\nsides of the pyramids being of such a height that the three pairs of\r\nopposite points are equidistant one from another, so that the octahedron\r\nenclosed in a cube would have an apex in the middle of each surface of\r\nthe cube. There are other shapes of diamond crystals, but they are all\r\nrelated to the cube, that is, they are all obtainable from the cube by\r\nsuccessively slicing off edges and angles. The natural diamond sometimes\r\nhas as many as 48 faces formed by such a process. This will easily be\r\nunderstood by the reader if he will take a cube of common soap and\r\nperform on it these operations _gradually_ with a sharp knife, taking\r\ncare always to make the new faces he produces equally inclined to the\r\nadjoining ones. He may begin by cutting off a tiny piece from one corner\r\nof the cube, forming a small equilateral triangle; then let him do the\r\nsame at two opposite corners, and again at all the eight corners. Then\r\nhe should make the cuts larger and larger, always producing equal sized\r\nequilateral triangles so long as these can be formed. In every case he\r\nwill have shaped out such forms as belong to diamond crystals. Instead\r\nof this, he may pare off one or more edges of the cube, or he may in\r\nvarious ways combine the two operations, and he will probably be\r\nsurprised at the variety of forms producible in this manner, all derived\r\nfrom the original cube and all representing possible forms of natural\r\ndiamonds, and indeed those of any substance that crystallizes in the\r\n_cubical system_. A model of the diamond octahedron can be readily made\r\nfrom the description already given, and the whole series of operations\r\nwill constitute an elementary but very instructive lesson in the science\r\nof crystallography.\r\n\r\nDiamonds are liable to occur with every imaginable distortion, so as to\r\nbe scarcely recognizable by their external form. A very pure smooth\r\nuncut diamond, belonging to the Rajah of Mattam in Borneo, is shaped\r\nexactly like a pear, two inches in length. By the way, battles have been\r\nfought for the possession of this gem, and it is said that,£200,000 was\r\nvainly offered for it. The diamond, notwithstanding its hardness, splits\r\nwith comparative ease in certain planes, and by such cleavage (a\r\nproperty common to all crystals) the octahedral form commonly emerges.\r\nIt was not until the middle of the fifteenth century that the art of\r\ncutting the diamond into regular facets was practised, and this can be\r\ndone only by the aid of diamond powder, prepared by crushing fragments\r\nand faulty stones in a hard steel mortar. The first operation is to\r\nsplit the stone by its natural cleavage, and the rough facets so\r\nproduced of two diamonds are ground together until they are quite\r\nsmooth. The grinding of other facets and the polishing are effected on\r\nhorizontal discs of steel making 2,000 revolutions per minute, and\r\noverspread with diamond powder mixed with olive oil.\r\n\r\nThe external surface of the diamond in its natural state is often very\r\nrough, the stone being always coated with a more or less opaque crust,\r\nso that its translucent interior is concealed or veiled; but when the\r\nreflection from its inner surfaces pierces this veil it glows as if\r\nlighted from within, giving that peculiar appearance which is called its\r\n“fire.” The surfaces of the diamond crystals are very often curved\r\ninstead of being flat, and the dodecahedral shape, when this is the\r\ncase, takes on an almost globular appearance. Diamonds of all colours\r\nare found, as well as the highly esteemed colourless stones. Yellow ones\r\nof various tints are frequent,—orange, brown, and pink are not very\r\nrare; but red, green, blue, and black are almost unique, at least in a\r\ncondition to form large and perfect gems, and are accordingly much\r\nprized. The black diamonds found in Borneo are so hard that ordinary\r\ndiamond powder has no effect whatever upon them; they have to be\r\nmanipulated with their own dust. The nature of the substances that\r\nimpart these colours to the diamond has never been made out; they must\r\nbe excessively small in quantity. When a diamond is burnt in air or in\r\noxygen gas by aid of a large burning glass or otherwise, an extremely\r\nminute quantity of ash remains, and this often retains the shape of the\r\nstone, in the form of a most delicate network; and of the composition of\r\nthe ash, this much has been made out: it contains silica and _iron_. We\r\nshall find that the presence of the last named element, although but in\r\nthe merest trace, is not without significance.\r\n\r\nThe purely utilitarian uses of the diamond are few, but of importance.\r\nThe most familiar is in the glazier’s tool for cutting glass, and in\r\nconnection with this we may mention a fact not generally known, namely,\r\nthat though any point of a diamond will _scratch_ glass, it is only by a\r\nnatural point of the crystal, and that point of a certain shape, that\r\nglass can be _cut_. Another kind of diamond, valueless as a gem, has\r\nbeen turned to good account in Major Beaumont’s invention, described in\r\nour section on Rock Drilling Machines, to which the reader is referred.\r\nMinute diamonds are employed for writing on glass, for very fine\r\nengraving, etc.\r\n\r\nHaving now said sufficient about diamonds in general to give the reader\r\nan interest in the subject, and yet but little more than was needed to\r\nimpart the information necessary for following the further development\r\nof the theme, we approach the discoveries in this connection which have\r\nspecially distinguished our century. We must transfer the reader’s\r\nattention to South Africa, and if he can refer to any recent map of that\r\nregion, particularly to one showing its physical features, it will be of\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 some children, playing near the banks of the Orange River, found\r\nwhat they thought to be merely a pebble prettier than the rest. A\r\nneighbour seeing the stone in the children’s possession, obtained it\r\nfrom their mother for a trifle. It passed through several hands, and was\r\nbought at last by the Governor of the colony for £500. The discovery\r\nshortly afterwards of other diamonds in the same locality attracted\r\nnumbers of persons to the district, and especially to the banks of the\r\nVaal River, which speedily became the scene of a great search for\r\ndiamonds. Though this search was confined to merely the surface of the\r\nsoil, it was attended with considerable success, and many fine diamonds\r\nrewarded the diligence of the eager seekers. One of the most remarkable\r\nstones for its great size, which equalled that of a walnut, was\r\ndiscovered by a Kaffir. When this gem had finally reached the hands of\r\nMessrs. Hunt and Roskell, of London, its value was estimated at no less\r\nthan £25,000. News of these discoveries having spread, a rush set in for\r\nthe diamond-fields of the Vaal River, and the banks of this stream soon\r\npresented an animated spectacle. Europeans flocked to the spot, London\r\njewellers sent agents, and the inevitable Jews appeared on the scene to\r\npurchase the precious gems from the lucky finders. It turned out that\r\nmany of the larger stones had a slightly yellow tinge, varying in\r\ndifferent specimens from the palest straw to a decided amber colour,\r\nand, as this detracted greatly from their value, no little\r\ndisappointment and loss were sometimes experienced when the gems came to\r\nbe sold in London and Paris.\r\n\r\nOne of the first settlements which sprang up on the banks of the Vaal\r\nRiver was a place called Pniel, of which the reader may form some idea\r\nfrom Fig. 332, which is copied from a sketch actually taken from the\r\nwindows of Jardine’s Hotel. It was then only a little straggling\r\nvillage, chiefly of wooden sheds or corrugated iron erections, with but\r\ntwo or three more substantial structures. The diamonds which were found\r\nin this neighbourhood were obtained from gravel which lay on the slopes\r\nof the hills rising from the river. The mode of conducting the search\r\nfor diamonds in these gravels was simple enough. The first operation was\r\nthe washing of the material, in order to remove sand and dirt, and this\r\nprocess was usually performed at the margin of the river, where the\r\ngravel was brought down in carts and deposited in a suitable place, at\r\nwhich a cradle was erected. The cradle was simply a strong wooden\r\nframing sustaining sieves of wirework or perforated metal, placed one\r\nabove the other, those at the top having the largest meshes, so that the\r\nlowest would only permit sand or very small pebbles to pass through. The\r\ncradle was capable of receiving a rocking movement, and while the gravel\r\nwas thus sorted, water was freely poured on the uppermost layer, so that\r\nthe stuff was in a short time thoroughly cleansed and sorted. When this\r\nhad been accomplished, the gravel was thrown in successive lots on a\r\ntable, at which the digger sat and rapidly examined it for diamonds by\r\nhelp of a flat piece of wood or iron (see Fig. 328). The larger gems\r\nwere readily detected, and indeed could be picked out from among the\r\npebbles on the sieve before the stuff was thrown on the sorting-table.\r\nCrystals of quartz, which sometimes glisten among the mass, often\r\nexcited groundless delight in the bosom of the inexperienced worker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 332.—_Pniel, from Jardine’s Hotel_ (_c._ 1870).\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the payment of certain fees, the digger obtained a “claim,”—that is,\r\nhe acquired the right of working an assigned portion of the soil. But if\r\nthe claim had been left unworked for a week, it might be, in mining\r\nparlance, “jumped”—that is, any person might take possession of it, or\r\njump into it, on procuring a proper licence.\r\n\r\nSince the first rush of diamond-seekers to the river-banks, the stones\r\nwere abundantly found elsewhere, namely, at the “dry diggings,” where\r\nthe soil, dug out with a pick or shovel, was sifted first through rough\r\nsieves, afterwards through sieves having fine wire meshes The sieve, in\r\nsuch cases, was often suspended by thongs of hide between two upright\r\npoles, in the manner represented in Fig. 333. The miner was thus enabled\r\nto swing the sieve rapidly about, until the sand and dirt were\r\nseparated, when the remaining gravel was emptied on the sorting-table in\r\nthe manner before described. As the idea was formerly entertained that\r\ndiamonds lie only on or near the surface of the soil, the early miners\r\nseldom penetrated more than a foot or two beneath the surface. But it\r\nwas discovered that, so far from it being true that diamonds are present\r\nin superficial deposits only, the finest stones are met with at\r\nconsiderable depths to which no defined limit can be assigned; thus in\r\nsinking a well large diamonds have been found at 100 ft. below the\r\nsurface. When these facts became known, many of the abandoned claims\r\nwere worked over again down to a depth of 30 ft. or 40 ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 333.—_Sifting at the “Dry Diggings”_ (_c._ 1870).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe rapid rise of localities under such conditions may be illustrated by\r\nthe case of Du Toit’s Pan, which is the centre of a dry-digging\r\ndistrict, and grew in a wonderfully short space of time from nothing to\r\nbe a town hiving several large hotels, two churches, several public\r\nbilliard-rooms, a hospital, and a theatre. In 1871 the _claims_ at this\r\nplace, each 30 ft. square, sold at prices varying from £1 to £50–-the\r\nperson who worked a claim paying also a small monthly sum for the\r\nlicence. But those who were lucky enough to have obtained the first\r\npossession of the claims at another famous dry-digging locality, named\r\nColesberg Kopje, at the cost of only the licence at 10_s._ per month,\r\nmust have been still more fortunate, and have realized an enormous\r\npercentage on their investments; for, four months afterwards the ruling\r\nprices at the last-mentioned place were £2,000 and £4,000 per claim.\r\nThis great increase in value cannot be wondered at, if the accounts\r\nrelated of the value of the diamonds found here are true. For instance,\r\nit is stated that one individual, who just before the great rush had\r\nbought a claim for £50, found in it diamonds worth £20,000. Colesberg\r\nhas become a populous town, with good buildings and regularly laid-out\r\nstreets, while a great camp of tents and other temporary structures\r\nstill surround it on all sides.\r\n\r\nAt all the towns above-mentioned newspapers were published, relating\r\nchiefly to matters interesting to the miners—giving, for example, lists\r\nof “finds,” with the names of the lucky finders. It is curious that the\r\nterm “diamondiferous” has, in these localities, come to be used as a\r\ngeneral term denoting excellence of any kind. Thus, when it is desired\r\nto apply an epithet of superlative praise to a pickaxe or to a piece of\r\nfurniture, this significant adjective is made use of; and a salesman in\r\nthe diamond-fields will not hesitate to speak of _diamondiferous_ coats\r\nand trousers!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 334.—_The Vaal River, from Spence Kopje_ (_c._ 1870).\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the early diamond-seekers at the Cape followed very\r\nprimitive methods, by simply washing in sieves the gravel and sand\r\nshovelled out of the river banks; and indeed, it was only when, about\r\n1871, they began to dig deeper that their working seems entitled to be\r\ncalled mining. The “dry-digging” operations began at the since famous Du\r\nToit’s Pan, by the circumstance of a Boer farmer finding to his great\r\nsurprise diamonds sticking in the walls of his house, which had been\r\nbuilt of mud. When the locality of this mud was examined by digging,\r\nmore diamonds were found; and when the excavation was continued\r\ndownwards, still more. At this place and at four others, all within a\r\ncircuit of less than four miles diameter, have been developed the\r\nrichest diamond _mines_ in the world, throwing into the shade the\r\nproduce of all the river gravel washings; and what is still more\r\nremarkable, showing no signs of exhaustion after nearly thirty years of\r\nworking, but rather the contrary. The locality soon presented a scene of\r\nthe most active industry, and it was not long before the town sprang up\r\nwhich has since become celebrated all the world over—Kimberley, the\r\ndiamond capital. Kimberley is situated at the northern part of the\r\nBritish territory known as Cape Colony, not far within its boundary, and\r\nabout 14 miles from the Vaal River, in Lat. 28° 43´ S., Long. 24° 46´ E.\r\nIt lies in a north-easterly direction from Cape Town, at a distance of\r\nabout 550 miles. When the existence of diamonds at the Cape became\r\nknown, a great influx of strangers seeking fortune set in to a land that\r\nhad failed to offer the attractions to colonists that America and\r\nAustralia did. Before the establishment of the overland route opened a\r\nmore direct way to India, China, and Australia, Cape Colony owed\r\nwhatever importance it had to its position as a provisioning and coaling\r\nstation for ships and steamers. As a British settlement it was little\r\nregarded, and its somewhat somnolent condition would have been deepened\r\nby the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, had not the diamond discovery\r\nin that very same year brought about a great change. But the early\r\ndiamond-seekers found their land of promise a wilderness without roads\r\nand without habitations, for the development of civilization did not\r\nthen extend far from the coast. It is true, that here and there, at\r\ngreat distances apart, a few primitive missionary stations might be\r\nfound, like that of Pniel shown in one of our cuts, which also represent\r\nthe inhospitable aspect of the country. One cannot but admire the pluck\r\nof the adventurers, who, though unversed in their quest, encountered in\r\nits prosecution prolonged toils and many hardships. But they were young\r\nmen, and their perseverance gained its reward. They came from all parts:\r\nfrom Britain, from America, from Australia, from Germany, even from\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThe finding at Du Toit’s Pan, and at contiguous places, of diamonds at\r\nsome depth below the surface of the soil, led to geological examinations\r\nof the district, which ultimately resulted in discoveries of the highest\r\ninterest and importance, as will now be explained, with first a few\r\nwords about the external features of the country.\r\n\r\nA traveller directing his steps northward from the sea-shore at almost\r\nany part of the southern coast of Cape Colony will be faced by several\r\nsuccessive ranges of mountains, or what will appear to be such, running\r\nmore or less parallel to the coast, and of no great elevation. When he\r\nhas reached the summits of these heights he will not find corresponding\r\ndeclivities on the northern side, but nearly level plains, bounded\r\nnorthwards by other similar ranges. Supposing him to set out at a point,\r\nsay, 150 miles east of Cape Agulhas (the most southern point of Africa),\r\nhe will, about 50 miles from the shore, have reached the top of the\r\nthird of the great escarpments which rise up like the stages of a\r\ngigantic terrace, and having thus gained the ridge of the Black\r\nMountains, he will see one of these almost level plains stretching\r\nbefore him a breadth of 80 miles, for the most part arid and\r\ninhospitable, with a much greater length east and west, and bounded on\r\nthe north by a portion of the range of elevations that in an almost\r\nunbroken line runs through Cape Colony to Delagoa Bay nearly parallel\r\nwith the coast, at a distance from it between 100 and 150 miles. This\r\nextensive plain is known as the _Groot Karoo_ (Great Karoo),—_karoo_\r\nbeing the generic name for such plains in South Africa. After crossing\r\nthe Great Karoo, our traveller, on mounting the last far-reaching step\r\nof the Brobdignagian staircase, may find himself on the summit of the\r\nNieuveldt Mountains, at an altitude of nearly 10,000 feet above the\r\nsea-level, attained in several widely separated stages within a distance\r\nof 140 miles. From the summit of these elevations there is no descent by\r\nterraces northwards, but the high tableland or plateau stretches away\r\nfor hundreds of miles, descending by only a gentle slope towards the\r\nOrange River, but maintaining an average altitude of nearly 6,000 feet,\r\nand extending far beyond the Orange River towards the Equator. Kimberley\r\nis situated about 50 miles north of the Orange River, and 4,042 feet\r\nabove the sea-level.\r\n\r\nIt was soon observed that the Karoos had common geological characters,\r\nconsisting in a certain series of shales, coal, limestones, etc., and\r\nthis series naturally came to be called the “Karoo formation,” just as\r\nwe in England speak of the Wealden formation, etc.; and it was found\r\nthat it extended over a greater part of Central South Africa, covering\r\nan area of at least 200,000 square miles, with an estimated thickness of\r\n5,000 feet. The reader need not imagine that a boring nearly a mile in\r\ndepth had to be made for the ascertainment of this last dimension, if he\r\nwill remember what has been said in the last paragraph about escarpments\r\nof the rocks looking everywhere towards the coast. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that these beds were originally the sedimentary deposits of a\r\nvast fresh-water lake, or inland sea, far back in geological times. But\r\nhere we need only concern ourselves with the development of the Karoo\r\nbeds about Kimberley. There the ground is covered by a sandy soil of a\r\nred colour, for it contains much iron. Below this there is a layer of\r\ndecomposed basalt, also containing much iron, its thickness varying from\r\n20 to 90 feet. This lies upon a bed of very combustible shale, with\r\ncarbon and iron pyrites, 250 feet thick, which from its great\r\ndevelopment here is known as Kimberley shale; then, after a conglomerate\r\nstratum 10 feet thick, is found a very hard compact rock, resembling\r\nhornblende, extending 400 feet downwards, and resting on another hard\r\nrock of quartz, also 400 feet in depth. These beds are _nearly_\r\nhorizontal, but dipping a little towards the north. In speaking of them\r\ncollectively we may use the local term of the miners and call them “the\r\nreef.”\r\n\r\nNow, there are a few certain spots near Kimberley, and two or three\r\nelsewhere, in which the strata forming “the reef” are not found, but\r\nsomething quite different. These may be compared to large dry wells,\r\nextending vertically downwards to unknown depths, which have been filled\r\nup with matters from below. They are called _pipes_, but they are\r\nuncommonly large ones; for though of a somewhat irregular circular or\r\noval shape, their diameters range from 200 to 500 feet. Nor must it be\r\nsupposed that the enclosing reef presents itself as a smooth wall, as\r\nthe name “pipe” might suggest. These _pipes_ are true diamond mines.\r\nThey are believed to have been formed by an eruptive action originating\r\nfrom below at a great depth, and this was not by the escape of red-hot\r\nlava or other molten rocks, but by that of steam or other gases. It is\r\nknown that the eruptive forces acted from below, for the edges of some\r\nof the strata are seen in places in the walls of the reef that surround\r\nthe pipes to be turned a little _upwards_. It is known that the erupted\r\nmatter was not molten lava or rock, for the shale and other strata show\r\nnone of those changes of character near the pipes which would have\r\nresulted from igneous action, and for the same reason the gas or steam\r\nthat escaped by these pipes could not have been highly heated. It must\r\ntherefore have forced its way through the strata by enormous tension or\r\npressure, and this either at one terrific outburst or possibly by the\r\ngradual enlargement of smaller volcanic chimneys. These blow-holes are\r\nfilled with a mixture of subterranean débris, as if mud had been forced\r\nup from below, carrying with it an extraordinary variety of rock\r\nfragments and crystallized minerals. These are embedded in a mass of a\r\nbluish-green colour much resembling indurated clay (but nearly as hard\r\nas ordinary sandstone), and this on long exposure to the weather\r\ncrumbles down to a yellow friable substance. More than eighty different\r\nkinds of minerals of the volcanic class have been found in this\r\n_breccia_, as it is termed by geologists, and it is remarked that these\r\nfragments could not have been exposed to any great heat, for their edges\r\nshow no signs of fusion. There are also embedded in the agglutinating\r\nsubstance large masses of the surrounding strata, sometimes having an\r\narea of several thousand square feet, and these are called in miners’\r\nparlance “floating reef.” The cementing material is named “blue ground,”\r\nand the same when crumbled down by exposure is known as “yellow ground.”\r\nThese colours are due to oxides of iron, which in the unaltered ground\r\ngive the blue-green tint, being lower oxides; but are converted by\r\nabsorption of oxygen into yellow and higher oxides. The upper part of\r\nthe pipes is filled to a depth of about 70 feet with “yellow ground,”\r\nproduced by the penetration of atmospheric influences. Blue ground and\r\nyellow ground alike contain diamonds, and the yield of these is pretty\r\nregular at all depths in the same mine (some have been explored down to\r\nnearly 2,000 feet), although it varies considerably from one mine to\r\nanother, and in some the east side is often richer than the west. Thus\r\nin one load (1,600 lbs.) of _ground_ from Du Toit’s Pan, in 1890, the\r\nquantity of diamonds found averaged less than 2 grains (0·5 carat),\r\nwhile Kimberley yielded 1·25 to 1·5 carats (5 to 6 grains). It is\r\nsingular that the stones from mines quite close together are so\r\ndistinctly different in character, that the Kimberley merchants can tell\r\nat once the source of any particular parcel. This would indicate that\r\nthe blue mud was not forced up the several pipes at one and the same\r\ntime, carrying with it diamonds from one birthplace.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the diamondiferous pipes is pointed out by no\r\nindication on the surface, which is covered nearly uniformly with the\r\nred sandy soil already spoken of; although indeed the site of the\r\nKimberley mine was marked by a slight elevation, and that of Du Toit’s\r\nPan by one of the depressions there called _pans_, which, at least in\r\nthe wet season, are receptacles for surface water. The Wesselton mine,\r\nwhich was found only in the last decade of the century, about a mile\r\nfrom Du Toit’s Pan, also showed a surface depression, and that had been\r\nutilised as a depositing place for dry rubbish. At a later period the\r\n“Leicester mine” was accidentally discovered 40 miles away. At\r\nJagersfontein, in the Orange River Free State, 60 miles from the\r\nKimberley mines, is another pipe which yields the finest diamonds of\r\nany, commanding prices nearly the double of those paid for the De Beers\r\nand Kimberley gems, being in fact their nearest commercial rival. The\r\nproprietorship of the Kimberley group having in 1889 become united in\r\nthe hands of one company, known as the “De Beers Consolidated Mines,”\r\nthis company is able practically to control the diamond market, as it\r\nhas sometimes turned out in a year as much as 3 million carats of\r\ndiamonds, which sell for about £3,500,000. Up to the end of 1892, 10\r\ntons of diamonds had been derived from these mines, representing a value\r\nof £60,000,000 sterling. In 1895, the De Beers Company sold diamonds to\r\nthe amount of £3,105,958, the total expense of working for that year\r\nbeing £1,704,813,—the net profit was £1,401,145. The effect of\r\nconsolidating all the Kimberley diamond interest into the De Beers\r\nCompany has been to give an almost complete monopoly to this last, which\r\nhas however found it advantageous to restrict its production to an\r\nannual output of about £3,000,000 in value, as the putting of a larger\r\nquantity of diamonds on the market would cause lowering of their price,\r\nand a diminution of the profits all round. The reason is, that though\r\nthe world at large annually spends between 4 and 4½ million pounds\r\nsterling in the purchase of diamonds, yet it would not by a reduction in\r\ntheir price be induced to spend proportionately more. The company are\r\nsufficiently supplied by only two of their mines, the Kimberley and the\r\nDe Beers, the expenses of working these being also relatively smaller\r\nthan is the case with the others. It may be of interest to compare the\r\nquantities of diamonds that have so far been produced from the world’s\r\ngreatest fields, leaving out Borneo, the Ural Mountains, Australia,\r\netc., as comparatively insignificant. Estimated produce of India, from\r\nthe remotest period, 10 million carats; of Brazil (since 1728), 12\r\nmillion carats; of South Africa, in only 19 years, 57 million carats.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the discovery of the Kimberley mine (July 1871) it was\r\ndivided into about 500 claims, each 31 feet square, and between these\r\nwere roadways across; but when the claims were excavated to a depth of\r\n100 feet or more the roadways became unsafe, and, the “blue ground”\r\nunderneath them being too tempting always to be left for their support,\r\nthey began to fall in, and the mine was often threatened with ruin from\r\nthis cause. The state of things became still worse when the unsupported\r\nwalls of the “pipe” itself began to collapse, so that by 1878 a quarter\r\nof the claims were buried in the ruins of the reef. These falls\r\ncontinued, and although very large sums were year after year expended in\r\nremoving the fallen reef, the cost amounting in 1882 to 2 million pounds\r\nsterling, it was found at last that very few of the claims could be\r\nregularly worked, and when in 1883 a tremendous fall of 250,000 cubic\r\nyards of reef took place, covering half the area of the mine, it became\r\nnecessary to adopt another mode of working, namely, a regular system of\r\nunderground mining. Vertical shafts were sunk at a considerable distance\r\nfrom the pipe itself, and tunnels from these carried through at\r\ndifferent levels, with a system of galleries so arranged that all the\r\n“blue ground” is removable without danger to the miners. The whole mine\r\nis illuminated by electric lights, and the different kinds of labour are\r\ncarried on by distinct sets of workmen, some of whom drill holes for the\r\nreception of dynamite cartridges, others shovel the material into\r\ntrucks, others again wheel the trucks along tram lines, which converge\r\nto a space where their contents are discharged into skips holding four\r\ntruck loads, in which they are hoisted to the surface at about the rate\r\nof 400 loads per hour. This goes on day and night, the miners working in\r\nthree shifts of eight hours each. About 8,000 persons are employed,\r\n6,500 of whom are blacks.\r\n\r\nFig. 334_a_ is a sketch section of the Kimberley diamond mine,\r\napproximately to scale, and a glance at this will elucidate the\r\nforegoing description. The thick vertical and horizontal lines show the\r\npositions of the shafts and galleries that have at various times been\r\nexcavated, the lowest gallery being connected with a shaft a\r\nconsiderable distance from the pipe, towards the right, but out of the\r\nrange of the sketch. The fringed lines at the top, with dates, give some\r\nidea of the forms of the excavations until the final fall of reef that\r\ndetermined the resort to subterranean working.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 334_a_.—_Sketch Section of the Kimberley Diamond Mine._\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the “blue ground” has come to the surface, how are the diamonds to\r\nbe extracted from the hard mass? how can a stone of a few grains weight\r\nbe found amongst 1,600 lbs. of miscellaneous matter—a thing perhaps not\r\nlarger than a peppercorn in four cubic feet of compact material? The\r\n“blue ground” is spread out on levelled and carefully prepared areas\r\ncalled “depositing floors,” and there, after a few months’ exposure, all\r\nbut the very hardest pieces crumble down, the atmospheric action being\r\naccelerated by turning the material over with harrows, and by occasional\r\nwaterings. The “blue ground” from the De Beers mine requires at least\r\nsix months of this treatment, and it contains a certain proportion of\r\nrefractory lumps that would not disintegrate in perhaps less than two\r\nyears. These lumps are coarsely crushed between rollers, and the\r\nfragments are spread over slowly moving tables, from which any larger\r\ndiamonds are picked off; the fragments left go through smaller crushers,\r\nand are subjected to still greater concentration. The depositing floors\r\nof the De Beers mine are laid out as rectangles, 600 yards long by 200\r\nyards wide, each holding about 50,000 loads. They occupy several square\r\nmiles, and as the “blue ground” spread upon them is always one of the\r\nmost valuable assets of the company, the quantity of it forms an\r\nimportant item in the balance-sheets, and the amount that can be\r\nrealized from it can be estimated with sufficient closeness, on account\r\nof the nearly uniform distribution of the diamonds. Thus in June 1895,\r\nthe 3,360,256 loads then on the floors were put down as equivalent to\r\nnearly 1 million pounds sterling. When the “ground,” thoroughly\r\nweathered, has become yellow and friable, it is transferred to the\r\nwashing machinery, by which about 99 per cent, of the original\r\nnon-diamondiferous material is removed, and, thus concentrated, the\r\ngravel is together with the mechanically crushed material submitted to\r\nthe action of a machine called the _pulsator_, where the gravel is first\r\nassorted into sizes by being turned about within an inclined iron\r\ncylinder perforated with several stages of round holes of diameters\r\nsuccessively of 2, 3, 4 and 6 sixteenths of an inch. The pieces that are\r\ntoo coarse to pass through the largest holes are taken to the _sorting\r\nhouse_ direct; but the stones that have passed through the cylinder drop\r\naccording to their sizes into four separate sieves called at Kimberley\r\n_jigs_, from the well-known mining term _jigger_, applied to a man who\r\nwashes ores in a sieve. The several jigs into which passes the now\r\nassorted gravel have screens with meshes corresponding to the holes in\r\nthe cylinder; and by a very ingenious arrangement the concentration is\r\ncarried to the point at which the diamonds can be individually picked\r\nout. The “jigs” themselves do not move, but all over the meshes of the\r\nscreen is spread a layer of leaden bullets, which prevent a too rapid\r\npassage through the screens, while the material is kept moving in water,\r\nby that liquid _pulsating_ or emerging in quickly succeeding gushes from\r\nbelow the meshes, and thus carrying off the lighter matters, while those\r\nof greater specific gravity, including the diamonds, work their way\r\ndownwards between the bullets and through the meshes, and are received\r\nin boxes which are periodically carried to the sorting house.\r\n\r\nWhen the now much concentrated diamondiferous gravel reaches the sorting\r\nhouse, the remaining operation consists merely in picking the diamonds\r\nout. But simple as this operation is, it has to be conducted\r\nsystematically. In the sorting house are long tables covered with plates\r\nof iron, and placed in a good light. Upon these is thrown the wet\r\ngravel, but not promiscuously; the different sizes being set apart, the\r\nsorter spreads out the heap before him with a flat piece of zinc, picks\r\nout the diamonds and drops them into a small box. Only white men in whom\r\nconfidence can be placed are allowed to deal with largest sized\r\nmaterial, for this offers the strongest temptation to purloiners, as in\r\nthis of course the most valuable stones are met with. This material,\r\nafter the first search, is submitted to the scrutiny of another person,\r\nto see that no diamond has been overlooked; but the smaller assortments\r\nare examined by blacks, who are closely supervised by white men. The\r\nvalue of the diamonds occasionally sorted out in a single day may reach\r\n£10,000.\r\n\r\nAt the diamond mines little trust is reposed in the honesty of the\r\nblacks. Below ground and above ground they work under the constant\r\nsurveillance of white men, and they live in “compounds” which are\r\nspacious areas—perhaps of 20 acres in extent—enclosed by lofty iron\r\nfences, and containing long rows of corrugated iron erections divided\r\ninto rooms, each appropriated to a score of natives. Food, etc., is\r\nsupplied from a store at less than ordinary prices, and the company find\r\nfuel and water gratis, and provide a well equipped hospital and medical\r\nattendance. There are swimming baths, and ample recreation grounds for\r\ndancing, etc. The natives of each of the many tribes keep by themselves\r\napart, and follow their own fancies. They receive good wages, and some\r\nof them save money. They are not allowed out of the “compound” or the\r\nmine, except to work on the depositing floor, which they do under guard.\r\nThey accept their restrictions voluntarily, making agreements for a\r\ncertain term, three months being the least. Those who leave, as many do\r\nto spend their earnings, often “not wisely but too well,” usually\r\nreturn. The depositing floors are surrounded by fences 7 feet high,\r\nunscalably and impenetrably armed with barbed wire; and as here robbery\r\nwould have the readiest chance, where the largest stones might be met\r\nwith, extraordinary precautions are taken, watch and ward being\r\nmaintained by day and by night. Not more vigilantly did Cerberus keep\r\nthe entrance of Pluto’s domain, nor the wakeful dragon guard the golden\r\napples of the Hesperides, than the patrols observe the depositing\r\nfloors. At night powerful electric searchlights are made to play across\r\nthe enclosures, so that unauthorized movements can scarcely escape\r\ndetection. Besides these provisions against theft, the laws of the\r\nColony prohibit any attempt at illicit dealing in diamonds, under a\r\npenalty of two years’ penal servitude.\r\n\r\nThe maximum penalties for contravention of the Diamond Laws are,\r\nhowever, much more severe, and that to an extraordinary degree. Thus any\r\nunlicensed dealer is liable to a fine of £1,000, or fifteen years’\r\nimprisonment, or both. And the authorized dealers are required to keep a\r\nmost minute record of all their transactions, to send a copy of it every\r\nmonth to the head of the police, and to produce it when required. It is\r\nneedless to say that extraordinary precautions are taken to prevent the\r\nnative workmen from secreting diamonds. And any person even finding a\r\ndiamond, and neglecting to report the circumstance to the proper quarter\r\nat once, is liable to the pains and penalties above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe “blue ground” was at first supposed to be the original home of the\r\ndiamond, within which it had somehow taken its shape. But no\r\nsatisfactory explanation was forthcoming as to the state of the carbon\r\nbefore its solidification into the crystalline form. The more general\r\nopinion has been in favour of a volcanic origin due to very high\r\ntemperature; and although the “blue ground” itself is clearly not the\r\nordinary erupted matter of volcanoes due to igneous fusion, the geology\r\npoints to the district having been the scene of very active and\r\nextensive volcanic energies at more than one remote period, for the bed\r\nof the Karoo inland sea has been several times covered by level sheets\r\nof molten matter extruded somewhere from below; but not through the\r\n“pipes,” which were blown out ages afterwards. The strata of basalt and\r\nof hornblendic mineral, which extend horizontally over great areas in\r\nthe Karoo formation, are of igneous origin, as are also some nearly\r\nvertical dykes of trap rock, about 7 feet wide, that are found\r\ntraversing the “blue ground” in certain directions. These intrusive\r\ndykes are of course more recent than the formation of the blue ground,\r\nand that is itself later than the production of the pipes. The fact of\r\nmany fragments of crystals being found in the “blue ground” does not\r\ncomport with the theory that supposes it to be the matrix; and besides\r\nthis, many of the diamonds show scratches, and as these are producible\r\nonly by other diamonds, it would appear that they must all have\r\ntravelled in company, some part of their journey at least.\r\n\r\nCarbon in any form is quite infusible at the highest temperature we have\r\nhitherto been able to produce, although an incipient softening under the\r\ninfluence of the electric arc has been suspected. Professor Dewar, an\r\nEnglish chemist, basing his data on analogies with other substances, and\r\non purely theoretical grounds, has calculated that the melting\r\ntemperature of carbon is near 3,600° C. (6,512° F.), and that it cannot\r\nremain in a liquid state at a temperature exceeding 5,527° C., when its\r\nvapour would have a tension equivalent to a pressure of 15 tons on the\r\nsquare inch. So far as these deductions are correct, both the melting\r\npoint of carbon and the boiling point of its liquid must lie within the\r\nrange of temperature expressed by 3,600° C. and 5,527° C. The most\r\nintense heat we can produce is that developed in the electric arc\r\ndischarge, and an eminent French chemist and metallurgist, M. Moissan,\r\nby employing special arrangements and very powerful currents, has thus\r\nbeen able to obtain in his “electric furnace” a temperature estimated at\r\n3,500° C., which nearly approaches the lower of the above-mentioned\r\nlimits, and he has thereby produced many new and unexpected chemical\r\ncombinations of refractory elements. Among the most striking of his\r\nresults is the formation artificially of real crystalline diamonds. He\r\nfound that carbon is freely dissolved by several of the metals in fusion\r\nat the temperature of the electric furnace. When the carbon separated\r\nfrom the metals, as they cooled and became solid, it was always in the\r\ncondition of graphite. The carbons of the electric poles were readily\r\nattacked by molten iron, and it was from the solution of carbon in iron\r\nthat Moissan prepared his diamonds. The fact of carbon thus combining\r\nwith iron was of course no discovery, as the reader already knows; and\r\nthe resulting combination was found, on allowing the metal to cool, to\r\nbe simply cast iron, the greater part of the carbon separating out in\r\nthe graphitic form. But M. Moissan, having studied the conditions of the\r\nKimberley mines, and recognizing the probability of the diamonds having\r\ntaken their origin at very great depths, where the pressure due to the\r\nweight of superincumbent strata would be immense, was struck with the\r\nidea of _pressure_ being in some way a factor in their formation; and it\r\noccurred to him that the carbon might separate from its liquid condition\r\nin the iron in the crystalline, and not in the graphitic form, if the\r\nsolidification could be effected under great pressure. The apparently\r\ninsurmountable difficulty of applying an enormous pressure to a small\r\nquantity of molten iron (half a pound) yielded to the experimenter’s\r\ningenuity. He took advantage of the circumstance that cast iron at the\r\nmoment of solidification expands, a property upon which depends its use\r\nfor many purposes. If then the fused mass were suddenly cooled on the\r\noutside, we should have a shell of solid iron enclosing a nucleus of\r\nstill fluid metal, which, on cooling in its turn, would tend to expand,\r\nand by so doing would exert a great pressure within the shell by which\r\nit was confined. At first Moissan plunged his glowing crucible into cold\r\nwater, but a method of more rapidly cooling it was to immerse it in\r\nmelted lead. It seems a strange proceeding to cool the crucible by\r\nsurrounding it with hot metal, yet the _difference_ of the temperatures\r\nwas sufficient to produce the desired effect, the cooling contact of\r\nwater not really operating on the intensely heated body, which becomes\r\nseparated from the liquid by a coating of _steam_. When the mass of iron\r\nwas dissolved off, diamonds of all kinds were found in the residue, and,\r\nthough extremely small, some crystals were perfect in shape and colour;\r\nevery variety that occurred in the mines being found reproduced in tiny\r\nsize. There was also some graphite in the residue. Many more crystals of\r\n“pure water” were obtained by the lead-cooling than by the\r\nwater-cooling, as the former process gave some flawless cubes and\r\noctahedra. The largest of the set was only 1/50 inch across, and\r\nalthough of perfect form when first extracted, within the course of\r\nthree months it had spontaneously split up into fragments.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently no danger of M. Moissan’s manufacture of diamonds\r\nfrom coke causing consternation at Kimberley; though it would not be\r\nwithout interest to speculate upon the consequences had the French\r\n_savant_ achieved the greater triumph of turning out carbon crystals in\r\nevery respect equal to the productions of nature’s own laboratories.\r\nWhat a drop there would have been in the shares of the De Beers Mines\r\nConsolidated! What heaviness of heart would have fallen upon those great\r\nladies who exult in the exclusive possession of priceless tiaras and\r\nprecious necklaces flashing with the resplendent gems! From a scientific\r\npoint of view, M. Moissan’s fabrication of even those minute crystals,\r\nwhich so soon spontaneously crumbled into fragments, is a distinct and\r\nvaluable success; for, notwithstanding their diminutive size and\r\ninstability, they show us that art has so far succeeded in imitating the\r\nprocesses of nature, that some of her secrets have been revealed. Though\r\nwe know the exact chemical composition of all kinds of crystallized\r\nminerals, very very few of these have we been able to imitate\r\nartificially. Nor is this to be wondered at; for nature’s resources are\r\nimmense compared with ours: she can command temperatures unlimited by\r\nwhich to form her solutions or liquefactions; prodigious pressures to\r\nkeep them close; and time immeasurable—geological time—in which to let\r\nthem cool, and their particles freely coalesce into geometric forms.\r\nHuman agency, being obviously unable to reproduce, even on the smallest\r\nscale, such conditions as attended the deposition and slow cooling of\r\nthe earth’s crust, may not hope to rival the products of the planet’s\r\nprime. So the fair owners of the earth-born gems may possess their souls\r\nin peace, free from any fear of the chemists’ crucibles; and the\r\nKimberley Diamond Companies are not likely to suffer panics from the\r\nresults of scientific researches, and probably will continue to pay\r\ntheir handsome dividends for time indefinite.\r\n\r\nBut curiously enough, a discovery of the latest years of our century has\r\nrevealed the existence of diamonds in a region not mapped by the most\r\nadvanced of geographers—a region which indeed cannot be defined by\r\ndegrees of latitude and longitude. In the recesses of an unquestionable\r\nmeteorite—one of those celestial lumps of iron of which mention has been\r\nmade in the earlier pages of this volume—real diamonds have been found.\r\nThese quite resembled the products of M. Moissan’s experiments, being\r\nextremely small, but including clear and perfectly shaped crystals,\r\nassociated with black ones, and also with much graphite in more or less\r\ndefinite forms. So very limited, however, could be the quantity of\r\ndiamonds obtainable from this hitherto unsuspected source, that even if\r\nthey rivalled in quality the finest stones from the South African mines,\r\nit might be difficult to form a “Company” for their _exploitation_.\r\nStill, there is the possibility of some one falling in with a little\r\nmeteorite containing some mature full-sized carbon crystals, and such a\r\none might be considered equally fortunate with the finder of the famous\r\nAustralian nugget “Welcome” (£25,000). The association of diamonds with\r\nthe ferruginous matter of the “blue ground” in the Kimberley pipes,\r\ntheir crystallization out of iron in M. Moissan’s experiments, and their\r\npresence in iron meteorites, would seem to point to special relations\r\nbetween the two elements, iron and carbon. Some of these relations are\r\nexemplified in another way by the profound modification effected in the\r\nphysical properties of iron, by its combination with a very small\r\nquantity of carbon, as in some kinds of steel; or again, by the\r\ndifferences between white cast iron and grey cast iron, as determined by\r\nthe condition of the carbon in each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 335.—_Portrait of Sir Humphrey Davy._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NEW METALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of the nineteenth century can boast of a series of\r\ndiscoveries more brilliant and more numerous than ever belonged to any\r\nother science within a like period. And the advantage to the world must\r\nhave been great, for chemistry more directly than any other branch of\r\nknowledge ministers to the useful arts and promotes the comfort and\r\nwell-being of society. The science itself, as it now exists, is almost\r\nthe creation of the present age. But its recent developments cannot be\r\nhere discussed; nor, of the immense number of new products with which it\r\nhas enriched the world, can more than a very few be brought under the\r\nreader’s notice in the remaining pages of the present work. Among the\r\nmost striking of the remarkable series of discoveries by which Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy penetrated the mysteries of matter was the isolation of\r\nthe alkali metals—a circumstance which marks an important era in the\r\nhistory of chemistry. That the alkalies were oxides of unknown metals\r\nhad indeed been previously surmised by chemists, from the fact of their\r\nbehaving like metallic oxides in neutralizing and combining with acids\r\nto form the class of compounds called _salts_. All attempts to decompose\r\nthese alkalies had proved fruitless until Davy separated the metal\r\n_potassium_ from potash, in 1807. When, however, this alkali had once\r\nbeen proved a compound, more correct ideas were introduced into chemical\r\nscience; the nature of other alkalies and earths was explained in like\r\nmanner, and new and powerful re-agents were placed in the hands of the\r\nchemist.\r\n\r\nDavy first obtained potassium by exposing to the action of the voltaic\r\ncurrent a fragment of potash which had become moist on the surface by\r\nexposure to the air. The battery was formed of the then unprecedented\r\ncombination of two hundred pairs of 6–inch plates on Wollaston’s plan,\r\nwhich was constructed for the Royal Institution of London. The heat\r\nproduced by the passage of the current fused the potash, and globules of\r\nmetallic potassium were separated at the negative wire. This method\r\nyielded the metal in very small quantities only, and at a great cost.\r\nGay Lussac and Thenard soon afterwards found that potassium could be\r\nobtained more cheaply and in greater abundance when fused potash was\r\nmade to flow over iron-turnings heated to whiteness in a gun-barrel, and\r\nthe hydrogen and potassium vapour were passed into a cooled receiver, in\r\nwhich the latter body was condensed. The metal is now obtained by\r\nheating potassium carbonate with charcoal. For this purpose it suffices\r\nto heat crude tartar in a covered vessel from which air is excluded. The\r\ntartar is first calcined in a crucible until all combustible vapour has\r\nbeen driven off. The charred mass, which now consists of potassium\r\ncarbonate mixed with finely-divided carbon, is then broken into lumps\r\nand quickly introduced into a wrought-iron retort, which is heated in a\r\nfurnace to nearly a white heat. A receiver in the form of a flat iron\r\nbox, 12 in. long, 5 in. wide, and ¼ in. deep, is adapted to the neck of\r\nthe retort, and is kept cooled by the application of a wet cloth on the\r\noutside. The potassium thus obtained is not pure, and it must be\r\ndistilled in an iron retort, as otherwise a powerfully detonating\r\ncompound is apt to be formed by a portion of the metal combining with\r\ncarbonic oxide.\r\n\r\nImmediately after his discovery of potassium Davy obtained sodium in the\r\nsame manner, and Gay Lussac and Thenard also procured it by the same\r\nprocess they used for the sister metal. Sodium is now extracted on the\r\nmanufacturing scale for use as an agent in the reduction of two other\r\nmetals, of which we shall have to speak. A mixture of dried sodium\r\ncarbonate, powdered charcoal, and chalk is heated in wrought-iron\r\ncylinders, about 4 ft. long, 5 in. internal diameter, and ½ in. thick.\r\nThe chalk takes no part in the chemical action, but is added in order to\r\ngive the sodium carbonate when it fuses a pasty consistence, and thus\r\nprevent the separation of the charcoal. A number of these iron cylinders\r\nare set in a reverberatory furnace; but they are coated with fire-clay\r\nand enclosed in earthenware tubes, to prevent their destruction by the\r\nintense heat. To one end of each cylinder a receiver is adapted, of the\r\nform and dimensions already described for potassium. The other extremity\r\nis closed by an iron plug, luted with fire-clay. When the charge in a\r\ncylinder is exhausted, a fresh one is introduced by removing the plug,\r\ntaking out the residue, and inserting a new supply of the mixture made\r\nup in a canvas bag. The operation is therefore continuous, and the metal\r\nobtained is nearly pure, as sodium does not exhibit the same tendency as\r\npotassium to form compounds with carbonic oxide.\r\n\r\nPotassium and sodium are extremely soft metals; they are lighter than\r\nwater, upon which they float, at the same time rapidly decomposing that\r\ncompound by displacing half the hydrogen, which is set on fire by the\r\nheat. The instant a piece of potassium touches the surface of water, a\r\nviolet flame bursts forth; but with sodium no flame appears unless the\r\nmetal is dropped on warm water, or prevented from swimming about. Since\r\nthese metals are thus capable of displacing hydrogen from its\r\ncombination with oxygen at ordinary temperatures, it follows that they\r\nmust have a powerful affinity for oxygen; and, indeed, they can only be\r\npreserved in rock oil, for they rapidly combine with the oxygen of the\r\nair. The great attraction of these metals for oxygen, and for chlorine\r\nand other similar bodies, induces the chemist to employ them for\r\nseparating such bodies from their combination with other metals. Sodium\r\nis generally employed for this purpose, as being far cheaper than\r\npotassium.\r\n\r\nAmong the sixty-nine elementary or undecomposable substances which,\r\nvariously combined, constitute the whole material of our planet, so far\r\nas we are acquainted with it, no fewer than fifty-six are metals. Of\r\nthese fifty-six metals very few are found in a free or uncombined state,\r\nlike the gold described in the last article. On the contrary, the whole\r\nof the metallic elements of the globe, with insignificant exceptions,\r\nexist in nature in a state of combination with one or more of the other\r\nthirteen non-metallic substances. In this condition they form the stony\r\nmasses which are termed the ores of the more common metals, and they\r\nconstitute also the earths, the metallic bases of which were, until\r\nrecent times, unsuspected and unknown. Davy followed up his discovery of\r\nthe metals of potash and soda by experimental demonstrations that the\r\nearths _alumina_, _magnesia_, and others, were really oxides of metals;\r\nand when the nature of these substances had once been established,\r\nchemists soon devised means for readily obtaining their metallic bases\r\nin an isolated form. The new metals which have been thus isolated all\r\ndeserve the attention of the chemist; and the general reader will\r\nprobably also regard with interest the processes by which two of these\r\nnew metals, for which practical applications have been found, are\r\nextracted, and the properties which have caused them to be produced on\r\nthe commercial scale. These are _aluminium_, the metallic base of common\r\nclay; and _magnesium_, the metallic base of common magnesia, and Epsom\r\nsalts, and a constituent of dolomite, or magnesian limestone.\r\n\r\nAluminium was first isolated by Œrsted, in 1827, by decomposing its\r\nchloride by means of potassium. The chlorine leaves the aluminium to\r\ncombine with the potassium, and thus the former is set free. Wöhler\r\neffected some improvements in Œrsted’s process, and he first obtained\r\nthe metal in malleable globules. It is, however, to Deville that we are\r\nindebted for the invention, in 1854, of a process which admitted of\r\napplication on a manufacturing scale. He obtains chloride of aluminium\r\nby mixing alumina (the oxide of the metal) with powdered charcoal made\r\ninto a paste with oil, and heating the mixture in a tubular earthenware\r\nretort, like those sometimes used in the manufacture of coal-gas, while\r\na current of dry chlorine is made to pass through the vessel. The\r\ncharcoal combines with the oxygen, forming carbonic oxide, a permanent\r\ninvisible gas; and the aluminium unites with the chlorine, giving rise\r\nto aluminium chloride, which, being volatile, sublimes into a chamber\r\nlined with glazed tiles, in which it condenses as a yellow translucent\r\nmass. The metal is reduced from the chloride in the following manner: A\r\ntube of hard glass, about an inch and a half in diameter, is placed over\r\na furnace, or chaffing-dish, as shown in Fig. 336, where D C is the\r\ntube, and G G an iron pan for containing the red-hot charcoal. Into the\r\npart of this tube marked E, about half a pound of dry aluminium chloride\r\nhas previously been introduced, and is kept in its place by plugs of\r\nasbestos. A current of dry hydrogen gas, perfectly free from air, is\r\npassed through the tube; the gas being generated in the vessel, A, and\r\nin B passed over some substance which removes from it all moisture. The\r\naluminium chloride is then gently heated by placing red-hot charcoal\r\nbeneath it, so that any hydrochloric acid it may contain may be\r\nexpelled. A long narrow porcelain tray, or “boat,” containing pieces of\r\nsodium, F, is then introduced into the tube; and, the current of\r\nhydrogen being still maintained, heat is applied to the part of the tube\r\ncontaining the sodium, and the aluminium chloride is made to distil over\r\nby a regulated heat. As it passes over the sodium, it is reduced with a\r\nvivid glow. The aluminium is set free, and collects in the tray with the\r\ndouble chloride of sodium and aluminium which is produced by the\r\nreaction. The tray is removed and more strongly heated in a porcelain\r\ntube through which a current of hydrogen is passing, and the metal is\r\nthus obtained in globules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 336.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Bell, of Newcastle, undertook the manufacture of aluminium by a\r\nsystem founded on this process. The first step is the preparation of\r\npure alumina, which may be obtained by igniting ammonia alum, or by\r\nprecipitating from a solution of alum free from iron, or from sodium\r\naluminate made from the mineral called _bauxite_. The precipitate of\r\nhydrated alumina, mixed with charcoal and common salt, is made into\r\nballs and dried. These balls, which are about as large as an orange, are\r\nplaced in upright earthenware retorts, which are heated to redness,\r\nwhile a current of dry chlorine is passed through them. The volatile\r\ndouble chloride of aluminium and sodium distils over, and is condensed\r\nin chambers lined with earthenware. This substance is mixed with\r\npowdered fluor-spar, or with _cryolite_ (itself a compound of\r\naluminium), which serves as a flux; and small pieces of sodium are\r\ninterspersed throughout the mixture. The proportions are ten parts of\r\nthe double chloride, five of fluor-spar, and two of sodium. This mixture\r\nis thrown upon the hearth of a reverberatory furnace, and the doors are\r\nshut to exclude air. A very intense action occurs: the chlorine,\r\nquitting the aluminium, seizes on the sodium, and their combination is\r\nattended by an enormous increase of temperature. The fused aluminium is\r\nrun off from the furnace together with the slags which are produced by\r\nthe operation. In this way, with a furnace having a hearth 16 ft.\r\nsquare, about 16 lbs. of aluminium can be obtained in one operation.\r\n\r\nRose, the eminent German metallurgist, prefers to obtain aluminium from\r\ncryolite, which is a compound of sodium, aluminium, and fluorine, found\r\nin large quantities in Greenland. It is powdered and mixed with common\r\nsalt, and with the mixture a certain quantity of sodium cut into small\r\npieces is uniformly mingled. The whole is thrown into a heated crucible,\r\npreviously lined with a fused mixture of cryolite and salt, and more of\r\nthe same mixture is poured upon the contents of the crucible, which is\r\nthen covered and exposed to a red heat for two hours. The aluminium\r\ngenerally collects into buttons, which may be easily melted together by\r\nheating them in a crucible with common salt.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious, from the preceding account of the processes of\r\nextracting aluminium, that the cost of the metal must depend upon that\r\nof sodium; and the same remark will apply to the case of magnesium. It\r\nis interesting to observe how the price of the alkaline metals has\r\ndecreased as improved processes have been devised, and as the scale of\r\nproduction has increased with the commercial demand for the article.\r\nPrepared by Gay Lussac and Thenard’s process, these metals were produced\r\nin but small quantities, and were sold at £5 per oz. When the mode of\r\nreducing them by charcoal came into operation, the price fell to 30_s._\r\nper oz.; and the researches of Deville so far improved the processes,\r\nthat in 1854 sodium could be procured for 5_s._ per oz. Mr. Gerhard, of\r\nBattersea, subsequently manufactured sodium, so that it can now be\r\nretailed at less than 1_s._ per oz. The price of aluminium before\r\nDeville’s investigations was about 24_s._ per oz., but now the metal can\r\nbe purchased at about one-eighth of that cost. [1875.]\r\n\r\nAluminium is a white malleable metal, in colour and hardness not unlike\r\nzinc. Its colour is not so white as that of silver, as it has a marked\r\nbluish tint. It can be rolled into very thin sheets, and by rolling it\r\nbecomes harder and more elastic. It can also be drawn into fine wire. It\r\nis remarkably sonorous, and a suspended bar gives out a clear musical\r\nnote when struck. Perhaps no property of aluminium more strikes a\r\nperson, who examines the metal for the first time, than its lightness.\r\nIt is, in fact, only two and a half times as heavy as water, while zinc\r\nis seven times, silver ten and a half times, and gold more than nineteen\r\ntimes as heavy as water. It retains its lustre in dry or in moist air\r\nfor any length of time, and at all ordinary temperatures. It is not\r\nacted upon by nitric or sulphuric acids, but is attacked by hydrochloric\r\nacids and by alkaline solutions with great energy. It has great rigidity\r\nand tenacity, and can be turned, chased, and filed with the greatest\r\nease, and without clogging the tools. In the Paris Exhibition,[15] M.\r\nChristofle showed spoons and forks and a cup made from it; and it may be\r\nmentioned, as showing the hardness and strength of the metal, that the\r\ncup could be allowed to fall on a stone pavement without being indented.\r\nThe metal gives a good impression by casting; and by striking under a\r\ndie, some admirable medals have been produced in it. Aluminium has\r\nhitherto been chiefly used for ornamental articles, and for purposes\r\nwhere lightness and rigidity are desirable, such as in the tubes of\r\ntelescopes, opera glasses, beams of balances, &c. Its unalterability and\r\nadmirable working qualities have also caused it to be used for cheap\r\ntrinkets and ornaments—such as watch-cases, bracelets, combs, seals,\r\npenholders, candlesticks, &c. It is, however, incapable of receiving the\r\nlustrous polish of silver, as it has a decidedly blue tint, so that it\r\nwill probably never replace silver for ornamental plate; but it would be\r\na good material for egg and mustard-spoons, as it is quite unaffected by\r\nthe sulphur compounds which so readily tarnish silver. It has been\r\nsuggested that if aluminium could be procured cheaply enough, “its\r\nhardness, lightness, and incapability of rusting would render it\r\nadmirably adapted for the helmets and cuirasses of the cavalry; it would\r\nmake splendid field-guns, as strong as the present ones, and not\r\none-third of their weight; and, in sheets, it might serve as an\r\nincorrodible roofing, far lighter and more durable than zinc. It would\r\nadmirably replace copper, if not silver, for the purpose of coinage. A\r\ncrown-piece in aluminium would hardly weigh more than a shilling in\r\nsilver, or a piece the size of a penny about as much as a copper\r\nfarthing. The same qualities of lightness, hardness, and incorrodibility\r\nalso excellently fit it for the beams of delicate balances, and for the\r\nsmall weights used by the analytical chemist. It would make admirable\r\nutensils for the more delicate operations of cooking—replacing the\r\ncopper ones, which render pickles and soups so poisonous. It is\r\nextremely sonorous, and would make capital bells.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Of 1867.\r\n\r\nSome difficulty in working the metal has occurred from the want of any\r\nsuitable solder. This difficulty has been overcome by electrolytically\r\ncoating the metal with copper at the place where it has to be united\r\nwith others, and then soldering the copper in the ordinary manner.\r\nAluminium readily forms alloys with copper, silver, and iron. The alloys\r\nwith copper vary in colour from white to golden yellow, according to the\r\nproportion of the metals. Some of these alloys are very hard and possess\r\nexcellent working qualities. The alloy of copper with 10 per cent. of\r\naluminium, which is called _aluminium bronze_, has been manufactured by\r\nMessrs. Bell in considerable quantities. It is made by melting a\r\nquantity of very pure copper in a plumbago crucible, and when the\r\ncrucible has been removed from the furnace, the solid aluminium is\r\ndropped in. An extraordinary increase of temperature then occurs: the\r\nwhole mass becomes white hot, and unless the crucible be made of a\r\nhighly refractory material, it is fused by the heat developed in the\r\ncombination of the two metals, although it may have stood the heat\r\nnecessary for the fusion of copper.\r\n\r\nThe qualities of aluminium bronze have been investigated by Lieut.-Col.\r\nStrange, who finds that the alloy possesses a very high degree of\r\ntensile strength, and also great power of resisting compression, its\r\nrigidity, or power of resisting cross strains, is also very great; in\r\nother words, a bar of the alloy, fixed at one end and acted on at the\r\nother by a transverse force tending to bend it, offers great\r\nresistance,—namely, three times as much as gun-metal. An advantage\r\nattending the use of the alloy for many delicate purposes is found in\r\nits small expansibility by heat; it is therefore well adapted for all\r\nfinely-graduated instruments. It is very malleable, has excellent\r\nsounding properties, and resists the action of the atmosphere. It works\r\nadmirably with cutting tools, turns well in the lathe, and does not clog\r\nthe files or other tools. It is readily made into tubes, or wires, or\r\nother desired forms. The elasticity it possesses is very remarkable; for\r\nwires made of it are found to answer better for Foucault’s pendulum\r\nexperiment than even those of steel. These admirable qualities would\r\nseem to recommend the alloy for many applications in which it might be\r\nexpected to excel other metals. It appears, however, that the demand for\r\nit has not met the expectations of the manufacturers, and the production\r\nhas been somewhat diminished of late, although it is used to some extent\r\nfor chains, pencil-cases, toothpicks, and other trinkets. When more than\r\n10 per cent. of aluminium is added to the copper, the alloy produced is\r\nweaker; and if the proportion is increased beyond a certain extent, the\r\nbronze becomes so brittle that it may be pulverized in a mortar.\r\n\r\nThe metal _magnesium_ was first prepared, in 1830, by the French chemist\r\nBussy, by a process similar to that by which Deville obtained aluminium.\r\nBussy heated anhydrous magnesium chloride with potassium in a porcelain\r\ncrucible; and when the vessel had cooled, and the soluble residue had\r\nbeen dissolved out by water, the metal was found as a grey powder, which\r\ncould be melted into globules. The recognition of the metal as the base\r\nof magnesia is, however, due to Davy. About a quarter of a century after\r\nBussy’s discovery Deville having shown that sodium could be substituted\r\nfor potassium in such reductions, the metal became more cheaply\r\nproducible, and soon afterwards Bunsen and Roscoe pointed out its value\r\nas a source of light. Mr. Sonstadt devoted himself to the elaboration of\r\na method of working Deville’s process on the large scale, and he\r\nsucceeded in establishing a company in Manchester for the manufacture.\r\nThe process as carried on at the company’s works in Salford is thus\r\ndescribed in the “Mechanics’ Magazine,” 30th August, 1867:\r\n\r\n“Lumps of rock magnesia (magnesium carbonate) are placed in large jars,\r\ninto which hydrochloric acid in aqueous solution is poured. Chemical\r\naction at once ensues: the chlorine and the magnesium embrace, and the\r\noxygen and carbon pass off in the form of carbonic acid. The result is\r\nmagnesium in combination with chlorine, and the problem now is how to\r\ndissolve this new alliance—to get rid of the chlorine and so obtain the\r\nmagnesium. First, the water must be evaporated, which would be easy\r\nenough if not attended with a peculiar danger. To get the magnesium\r\nchloride perfectly dry it is necessary to bring it to a red heat; but\r\nthis would result in the metal dropping its novel acquaintance with\r\nchlorine and resuming its ancient union with oxygen. To avert this\r\nre-combination, the magnesium chloride whilst yet in solution is mixed\r\nwith sodium chloride (_i.e._, common salt), and thus fortified, the\r\naggressions of oxygen whilst drying are kept off. The mixture is exposed\r\nin broad open pans over stoves, and when sufficiently dry, the double\r\nsalt is scraped together and placed in an iron crucible, in which it is\r\nheated until melted, whereby the last traces of water are driven off. It\r\nis then stowed away until required in air-tight vessels, to prevent\r\ndeliquescence. Here comes in that curious metal, sodium, also discovered\r\nby Davy. Five parts of the mixed magnesium and sodium chlorides, mingled\r\nwith one part of sodium, are placed in a strong iron crucible with a\r\nclosely-fitting lid, which is then screwed down. The crucible is heated\r\nto redness in a furnace, and its contents being fused, the sodium takes\r\nthe chlorine from the magnesium. When the crucible has been lifted from\r\nthe fire and allowed to cool, the lid is removed and a solid mass is\r\ndiscovered, which, when tumbled out and broken up, reveals magnesium in\r\nnuggets of various sizes and shapes, bright as silver.”\r\n\r\nThe crude metal also presents itself in the crucible as small grains,\r\nand even as a black powder. The whole is carefully separated from the\r\nrefuse; it is purified by distillation in a current of hydrogen gas; and\r\nit is afterwards melted and cast into ingots. Magnesium is a very light\r\nmetal, its specific gravity being only 1·743; that is, it is only one\r\nand three-quarter times heavier than water. When heated in the air it\r\ntakes fire, and is rapidly converted into the oxide, magnesia. In the\r\nform of wire or of narrow ribbon, it burns easily in the air, producing\r\na light of dazzling brilliancy, which among artificial modes of\r\nillumination is rivalled only by the electric light. This is the chief\r\nuse at present made of the metal. Lamps have been contrived for burning\r\nthe wire in such a manner as to obtain a steady light, the wire being\r\npushed forward at a regulated rate by clockwork. The magnesium light is\r\nrich in the rays which act upon sensitive photographic plates, and it\r\nhas been successfully employed in obtaining photographs of dark\r\ninteriors, such as vaults or caverns, and for the exploration of mines\r\nand other dark places. The brilliancy of the firework displays which can\r\nbe produced by magnesium far surpasses that obtainable by any other\r\nmaterial used by the pyrotechnist. In such exhibitions balloons are sent\r\nup having burning magnesium attached to them; and the metal in the state\r\nof filings is also mixed with other materials. But magnesium is still a\r\nvery costly metal, and while the firework-makers find it too expensive\r\nfor common use, they complain that its brilliancy in occasional displays\r\ndulls by contrast the effect of the ordinary fireworks, with which the\r\nspectators are no longer satisfied.\r\n\r\nMagnesium wire is not produced by drawing, as the metal is not ductile.\r\nThe wire is formed by a method identical with that used in the\r\nfabrication of the leaden rope for making bullets (p. 330); that is to\r\nsay, the metal is forced in a heated and softened state through a small\r\nopening in an iron cylinder. The intensity of the magnesium light has\r\nbeen measured by Bunsen and Roscoe. They say that 72 grains of\r\nmagnesium, when properly burnt, evolve as much light as 74 stearine\r\ncandles burning for ten hours, and consuming 20 lbs. of stearine. Lamps\r\nin which magnesium may be steadily burnt are made by Mr. F. W. Hart, of\r\nLondon. In the more elaborate forms of these lamps, there are springs\r\nand wheels for pushing forward the magnesium ribbon, or a strand of\r\nmagnesium wire, into the flame of a spirit-lamp; while at the same time\r\nthe magnesium wire is made to revolve on its axis, in order to overcome\r\nits tendency to bend down, which would be a great disadvantage when the\r\nlight is used for optical apparatus. But for ordinary purposes a much\r\nsimpler arrangement suffices: the magnesium ribbon or wire is coiled on\r\na drum, from which it is drawn off by passing between two little\r\nrollers, which are turned by hand. The wire or ribbon is drawn off the\r\ndrum by the rollers, and pushed forward through a guiding tube, which\r\nbrings it into the apex of the flame of a spirit-lamp. In this simpler\r\nform of lamp the rate is, of course, directly dependent on the person\r\nwho turns the winch of the feeding-rollers; but in the automatic lamp\r\nthere are appliances for adjusting the rate; the suitable speed must be\r\nfirst found by trial, and then the apparatus is to be regulated\r\naccordingly. By means of these lamps photographs can be taken as quickly\r\nas with sunlight, on account of the abundance of chemically-active rays\r\ngiven out by the burning magnesium. It has been found that an equivalent\r\nof magnesium, in combining with oxygen, liberates a larger amount of\r\nheat than the equivalent quantity of any other metal, not excluding even\r\npotassium. Magnesium forms alloys with several other metals, such as\r\nlead, tin, mercury, gold, silver, platinum. All these alloys are\r\nbrittle, and have a granular or crystalline fracture. They are too\r\nreadily acted on by air and moisture to be of any service in the arts.\r\nThe alloy of 85 parts of tin with 15 of magnesium is hard and brittle;\r\nits colour is lavender, although both constituents are white, or nearly\r\nso; and it decomposes water at ordinary temperatures. Both metallic\r\nmagnesium and aluminium furnish useful re-agents to the scientific\r\nchemist. The latter metal, when fused, dissolves boron, silicon, and\r\ntitanium, and on cooling deposits these elements in the crystalline\r\nform, this being the only known process for artificially preparing them\r\nin the crystalline state.\r\n\r\nSince the above paragraphs were written, the price of sodium has been\r\nfurther greatly reduced, and it can now (1890) be purchased in bulk at\r\nabout 4_s._ per lb. This cheapness has brought the substance into use\r\nfor the reduction of other metals and one consequence has been a great\r\nfall in the price of aluminium. At Salindres, in France, the process of\r\nobtaining this metal that has been described on page 587, has been in\r\nuse for many years, during which considerable quantities of aluminium\r\nhave been produced, the output for 1882 being stated as 5,280 lbs.\r\nAluminium has lately been prepared by a company at Wallsend-on-Tyne from\r\n_cryolite_, a mineral which is found only in Greenland, but occurs there\r\nin great abundance. Cryolite is a double fluoride of aluminium and\r\nsodium, and the processes for its reduction consist in fusing it with\r\ncommon salt in a reverberatory furnace, drawing off the mixture into an\r\niron vessel, and stirring into the fused mass a certain quantity of\r\nsodium. This produces a violent action, on the cessation of which the\r\nslag is poured off, and the metallic aluminium is found as a “button” at\r\nthe bottom of the converter. For obtaining a purer metal, the fusion is\r\nmade in crucibles, and the sodium is added in two operations without\r\nremoving the crucible. The yield of aluminium is about 8 per cent. of\r\nthe weight of cryolite, and three parts of sodium are required to\r\nfurnish one part of aluminium. Another large manufactory of aluminium is\r\nin operation at Oldbury, near Birmingham. There is a special difficulty\r\nin the metallurgy of aluminium, arising from the fact of the qualities\r\nof the metal being much deteriorated by the presence of a very small\r\namount of foreign matters such as iron, silicon, &c., at the same time\r\nthat no process has been found for purifying the product from these\r\nsubstances. If the aluminium is to be pure it must be so prepared at the\r\nfirst. Electrolysis has been proposed as a means of reducing the\r\ncompounds, and obtaining the metal free from admixtures. Experiments\r\nseem to show that the dynamo-electric machine may be applied to this\r\npurpose, as well as to the reduction of sodium compounds, when certain\r\npractical difficulties arising from the chemical energies of the\r\nliberated substances have been overcome. What is called the “electric”\r\nfurnace has been successfully used in the production of aluminium\r\nbronze. It is a rectangular iron box, 5 feet long, 1 foot deep, and 15\r\ninches wide, with electrodes formed of rods of carbon 30 inches long and\r\n3 inches in diameter. It is charged with a mixture of 25 parts of\r\ncorundum (native crystallized oxide of aluminium), 12 parts of carbon,\r\nand 50 parts of granulated copper. This is covered at the top by lumps\r\nof charcoal, and a lid is fastened over the whole. The current from a\r\npowerful dynamo is sent through the carbons, and in about ten minutes\r\nthe copper is melted, when the electrodes, at first only a few inches\r\napart, are moved to an increased distance, and the strength of current\r\nincreased. The corundum is reduced, the aluminium alloying itself with\r\ncopper, and the oxygen combining with the carbon to form carbon\r\nmonoxide, which is driven off. The resulting alloy is cast into ingots,\r\nits percentage of aluminium ascertained, and then it is melted with\r\nenough copper to produce aluminium bronze (page 719). The price of\r\naluminium, which was as already stated about 3_s._ per ounce in 1875,\r\nhas been so much reduced that the metal may now (1890) be purchased for\r\n11_s._ or 12_s._ per lb. We may therefore expect to see wider\r\napplications of its excellent qualities. Though the price per lb. is\r\nstill much higher than that of copper-–22 or more times as much—the\r\nmetal is so much lighter that a lb. of aluminium occupies nearly 3⅓\r\ntimes the space of a lb. of copper, so that, taking bulk for bulk,\r\naluminium is only about seven times as dear as copper. [1890.]\r\n\r\nWhen first introduced by Deville, in 1854, aluminium cost £20 per lb.;\r\nbut its prospective value for application in the arts was recognised,\r\nand in two or three years afterwards it was put on the market at 40_s._\r\nper lb. It was then, as already remarked, applied to many purposes where\r\nlightness is desirable, such as for the tubes of telescopes,\r\nopera-glasses, the mounting of photographic lenses, &c. And in 1888,\r\nwhen the production of sodium had been cheapened and applied to the\r\nseparation of aluminium, the price of the latter metal fell to 18_s._\r\nper lb. In the meantime, the cheap electricity of the dynamo caused\r\nattention to be again directed to the original electrolytic method; but\r\nmany difficulties in detail had to be overcome in applying this process\r\non the commercial scale. At length the sodium process was superseded;\r\nand by the beginning of 1890, a Swiss company was producing aluminium at\r\n11_s._ per lb. In the course of the following year they succeeded in\r\nbringing the price down to 2_s._ per lb.; and again three years later,\r\nnamely at the beginning of 1894, they could offer the metal at 1_s._\r\n7_d._ per lb. The conditions required for effecting this great reduction\r\nwere found in driving the dynamo machinery by water-power, and in an\r\nabundant supply of cryolite at moderate cost. This cheapness of\r\nproduction at once placed the Swiss company in the position of being the\r\nlargest and most successful aluminium manufacturers in the world, so\r\nthat in 1892 they had realised a net profit of £21,563, paying their\r\nshareholders 8 per cent., and, further, in 1893, the net profit was half\r\nas much again, and the dividend was increased to 10 per cent. A British\r\naluminium company has recently been formed in London for acquiring the\r\nrights of working all the processes of the successful Swiss company,\r\npurchasing outstanding English patents, amalgamating with certain\r\nexisting companies, and for working the _bauxite_ deposits in Ireland,\r\n&c., &c. There is every reason to believe that an important result of\r\nthis enterprise will be a still further reduction in the price of this\r\nmetal, and consequently a great extension of its applications. And now\r\n(September, 1895) we have already heard of a further reduction in the\r\nprice of this metal, which, at the present time, can be purchased in\r\nbulk for about 1_s._ 6_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 337.—_Portrait of Mr. Thomas Hancock._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INDIAN-RUBBER AND GUTTA-PERCHA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _INDIAN-RUBBER._\r\n\r\nResearches into the history of the human race in remote ages have\r\nrevealed the fact, that before man knew how to extract metals from their\r\nores, his only implements were formed of stone; and before he became\r\nacquainted with iron, there was an intermediate period in which the more\r\neasily obtained metal, copper, had to serve as the material for all\r\ntools and weapons. Hence archæologists speak of the stone age, the\r\nbronze age, and the age of iron. If we were obliged to name the\r\nnineteenth century after the material which distinctively serves in it\r\nfor the most extensive and varied uses, surely we should call it the Age\r\nof Indian-rubber!\r\n\r\nThe industrial application of Indian-rubber is entirely modern. The\r\nsubstance itself appears, however, to have been known to the natives of\r\nPeru from time immemorial, and to have been used for the preparation of\r\nsome kind of garments. Although the first specimens were sent to Europe\r\nso long ago as 1736, and the substance was from that time submitted to\r\nmany investigations, no other use was found for it up to the year 1820\r\nthan to efface from paper the marks made by pencils. From this it\r\nderives the name by which it is commonly known. It has also been called\r\n“gum elastic,” and _caoutchouc_ from the Indian name. Crude caoutchouc\r\nis the product obtained by the spontaneous solidifying of the milky\r\njuice of certain tropical plants—such as the _Hævea elastica_, _Jatropha\r\nelastica_, and the _Siphonia cautshu_. The first grows chiefly in South\r\nAmerica, and in the basin of the Amazon forms immense forests. At a\r\ncertain season each year bands of persons, called “_seringarios_,” armed\r\nwith hatchets, visit these forests for the purpose of extracting the\r\ncaoutchouc. They make incisions into the trunk, and the milky juice\r\nimmediately runs out, and drops into a vessel placed to receive it, and\r\nattached to the tree by means of a lump of clay. In about three hours\r\nthe juice ceases to flow, and the _seringario_ collects the products of\r\nthe incisions in one large vessel. By dipping a board into this vessel,\r\nit becomes covered with the juice; and when this is allowed to dry, the\r\ncaoutchouc remains as a thin brownish yellow layer. The caoutchouc is\r\nnot dissolved in the juice, but is merely suspended in it; and to hasten\r\nthe drying and coagulation of the liquid, the board is warmed over a\r\nsmoky fire made with green wood. When alternate immersions and drying\r\nhave covered the board with a sufficient thickness of caoutchouc, the\r\nlayer is slit open with a knife, and the board is withdrawn. This is the\r\nbest kind of crude caoutchouc, because it is free from all admixture of\r\nforeign bodies except the carbon derived from the smoky flame. The\r\n_bottle_ Indian-rubber is moulded on pear-shaped lumps of clay, which\r\nare covered with successive layers of the milky juice; when a sufficient\r\nthickness has been attained, the clay is removed by soaking in water.\r\n\r\nUp to 1820, as already mentioned, Indian-rubber was used only for\r\neffacing pencil-marks, and about that time a piece half an inch square\r\nsold for two shillings and sixpence. But the extreme elasticity and\r\nextensibility of this singular substance was attracting the attention of\r\npractical men in England, Scotland, and France. One of the earliest\r\npatents obtained in this country for applications of caoutchouc was\r\ntaken out by Mr. Thomas Hancock, of Newington, in 1820. This gentleman\r\nhas written an account of the Indian-rubber manufacture from the\r\ncommencement, and the book is extremely interesting from the clear and\r\nsimple manner in which the inventor describes how he effected one\r\nimprovement after another in his processes and machinery. Mr. Hancock\r\nhad, previous to his turning his attention to Indian-rubber, no\r\nacquaintance with chemistry; but he was skilled in mechanical\r\nengineering and the use of tools, and this knowledge proved to be\r\nprecisely the kind most valuable for dealing with the first stages of\r\ncaoutchouc manufacture. His first patent was for the use of\r\nIndian-rubber for the wrists of gloves, for braces, for garters, for\r\nboots and shoes instead of laces, and for other similar purposes. The\r\nrings for the wrists of gloves, &c., were simply cut from the bottle\r\nIndian-rubber by machinery the patentee himself contrived for that\r\npurpose. Mr. Hancock next arranged an apparatus for flattening the raw\r\nIndian-rubber by warmth and pressure, so as to make it available for the\r\nsoles of boots, &c. He relates the practical difficulties he had to\r\nencounter in his operations, and the manner in which he overcame them.\r\nHe soon noticed and utilized the fact that two clean freshly-cut\r\nsurfaces of caoutchouc, when pressed together, cohere and unite\r\nperfectly. This further led him to devising a machine by which all the\r\nwaste cuttings and parings might be worked up. This machine consisted of\r\na cylinder revolving within a cover, both being provided with steel\r\nteeth, by which the pieces of caoutchouc placed between them were torn\r\ninto shreds, and then kneaded into a solid coherent mass of homogeneous\r\ntexture. The first machine of this kind made by Mr. Hancock would work\r\nup about 1 lb. of Indian-rubber; but now machines on the same principle\r\nare in use operating on more than 200 lbs. of material at once, and\r\nturning it out on a roll 6 ft. long, and 10 in. or 12 in. in diameter.\r\n\r\nWhile Hancock was thus successful in mechanically working Indian-rubber,\r\nMacintosh, of Glasgow, found means of effecting its solution by\r\ncoal-naphtha, and he obtained, in 1823, a patent for the application of\r\nhis discovery to the fabrication of waterproof garments. Waterproof\r\ncloth, or “Macintosh,” is prepared by varnishing one side of a suitable\r\nfabric with a solution of caoutchouc, or by covering one side of a cloth\r\nwith a thin film, and then bringing it into contact with a second piece\r\nsimilarly prepared—the two caoutchouc layers becoming incorporated when\r\nthe double cloth is passed between rollers. Other solvents for\r\nIndian-rubber have been discovered in ether, chloroform, sulphide of\r\ncarbon, and rectified turpentine. By treatment with these liquids it\r\nswells up, and eventually dissolves, producing a viscid ropy mass,\r\nwhich, by evaporation of the solvent, leaves the caoutchouc with all its\r\noriginal elasticity. By the use of these last-named solvents the\r\npersistent and disagreeable odour occasioned by coal-oil is avoided. Mr.\r\nHancock relates that when the manufacturers had overcome all obstacles,\r\nand had succeeded in producing thin, light, pliable, and perfectly\r\nwaterproof fabrics, they had to encounter another quite unexpected\r\ndifficulty—the tailors set their faces against the new material, and\r\ncould not be induced to make it up! The manufacturers were, therefore,\r\nobliged themselves to fashion waterproof garments, and retail them to\r\nthe public. This, however, turned out to be a benefit, for the seams\r\nwere made waterproof, so as to exclude even the little water which would\r\notherwise pass in by capillary attraction at the stitches.\r\n\r\nIt will now be observed that there are two distinct modes of working\r\ncaoutchouc: by dealing, viz., with the solid material, or with the\r\nsolutions. Thus, from a solid disc of caoutchouc long ribbons of the\r\nmaterial may be cut, and these ribbons, by being passed between a set of\r\ncircular knives, may be divided into a number of square threads. These\r\nthreads may then be drawn out to six or ten times their length; and, if\r\nwound and maintained in this state of tension for forty-eight hours in a\r\nwarm place, they will lose their condition of tension, and their\r\nelongated form will become their natural or unstrained one. In this\r\nmanner are the Indian-rubber threads prepared, which, covered with silk\r\nor other material, form elastic fabrics such as those used in the sides\r\nof boots. The circumstance of caoutchouc, when heated for some hours at\r\na temperature a little above the boiling-point of water, retaining\r\nwhatever form it has during the heating, is the basis of methods of\r\nobtaining thin sheets and other forms of the material. Tubes are made by\r\nforcing the heated caoutchouc through an annular opening by application\r\nof great pressure; it sets in cooling, preserving a section\r\ncorresponding with the orifice through which it issues. In another mode\r\nof forming tubes, a paste composed of caoutchouc, oxide of zinc, and\r\nlime, is formed into sheets, which are cut into strips. The strips are\r\nfolded longitudinally, and the edges are cut together at an angle of 45°\r\nwith the surface, so that the cut surfaces may meet each other when the\r\nstrip is rolled on a mandril to give it a cylindrical form. A slight\r\npressure suffices to solder together the cut surfaces, and the tube is\r\nthen “vulcanized” by a process to be presently described.\r\n\r\nThe dissolved caoutchouc serves to prepare waterproof garments, round\r\nthreads, sheets of Indian-rubber, &c. Fabrics are coated with the\r\nsolution by pouring it on the material as it is passing horizontally\r\nfrom a roller. A straight-edge, under which the charged cloth passes,\r\ndistributes the caoutchouc in a uniform layer, the thickness of which is\r\nregulated by the space between the knife-edge and the fabric. When\r\nsulphide of carbon is the solvent used, its evaporation is complete in\r\nabout ten minutes, but with other solvents two or three hours are\r\nrequired. The caoutchouc is usually mixed with lampblack before being\r\nspread on the cloth, and the article is finished by giving the\r\nIndian-rubber layer a coat of gum-lac varnish. Sheets of Indian-rubber\r\nare obtained by spreading fifteen or twenty layers over a cloth, which\r\nis afterwards detached by wetting it with a solvent.\r\n\r\nThreads of circular section are manufactured from a paste of caoutchouc,\r\nmade by dissolving that substance in sulphide of carbon mixed with 8 per\r\ncent, of alcohol. This paste is placed in a cylinder, out of which it is\r\nforced by a piston through a number of circular holes, whence it issues\r\nin the form of filaments. These are received upon a stretched cloth,\r\nwhich moves along, carrying the parallel threads, until the sulphide of\r\ncarbon has evaporated.\r\n\r\nA modification of caoutchouc, possessing very valuable qualities for\r\nmany purposes, was discovered by Mr. Charles Goodyear, and largely\r\napplied by him in the United States to the fabrication of waterproof\r\nboots. In 1842 these boots were imported into Europe, and it was seen\r\nthat this form of the material had the advantages of not sticking to\r\nother bodies at any ordinary temperatures, and of preserving its\r\nelasticity even in the coldest weather, whereas ordinary Indian-rubber\r\nbecomes rigid by cold. The cut edges of this variety of caoutchouc do\r\nnot cohere by pressure. Mr. Goodyear attempted to keep his process a\r\nsecret; but Mr. Hancock, having soon detected the presence of sulphur in\r\nthe American preparations, set to work to discover how that substance\r\nwas made to combine with the caoutchouc. He succeeded, and he obtained a\r\npatent for sulphurizing Indian-rubber before the original inventor had\r\napplied for one. Mr. Hancock found that a sheet of caoutchouc immersed\r\nin melted sulphur at 250° F., gradually absorbed from 12 to 15 per cent,\r\nof its weight of sulphur; and, further, that this does not in any way\r\nalter its properties. When, however, the sulphurated substance was for a\r\nfew minutes exposed to a temperature of 300°, it acquired new qualities,\r\nwhich were precisely those of the modification employed by Mr. Goodyear\r\nfor his impervious boots. This transformation effected by sulphur Mr.\r\nHancock called _vulcanization_; and _vulcanized Indian-rubber_ is now\r\nemployed in nearly all the innumerable applications of caoutchouc,\r\nprovided the presence of sulphur is not absolutely objectionable.\r\nGoodyear’s process consists in mixing the sulphur with the caoutchouc,\r\nthe suitable proportion (7 to 10 per cent.) having been determined\r\nbeforehand, and the sulphur ground up with the Indian-rubber in the\r\nmasticating machine, or disseminated through the viscid liquid if a\r\nsolution is used, or dissolved in the solvent employed. This gives\r\nbetter results than Hancock’s process, because the sulphurization is\r\nmore uniform, and this method is therefore more largely employed. When\r\nthe various articles have been fabricated in the ordinary manner from\r\nthe mixture of caoutchouc and sulphur, they are enclosed in vessels,\r\nwhere they are submitted for two or three hours to the action of steam\r\nunder a pressure of nearly 4 atmospheres, so that the steam may have a\r\ntemperature of about 280° F. A still easier method, due to Mr. Parkes,\r\nconsists in steeping the articles (which in this case should be thin) in\r\na solution of one part of chloride of sulphur in sixty of bisulphide of\r\ncarbon. The object becomes vulcanized by simple exposure to the air,\r\nwithout the aid of heat. But this process is said to be liable to cause\r\nthe article afterwards to become brittle. The addition of oxide of zinc,\r\ncarbonate of lead, and other substances, is found to yield a product\r\nbetter adapted for certain purposes than one in which only sulphur is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe list of applications of vulcanized Indian-rubber would be a very\r\nlong one; but as a great number of these applications must be known to\r\neverybody, it will be unnecessary to specify them. It has lately been\r\nused for carriage-springs, for the tires of wheels, and for the rollers\r\nof mangles. Its employment in the construction of portable boats,\r\npontoons, life-buoys, dresses for divers and for the preservation of\r\nlife at sea, air-tight bags and cushions, air and water beds, cushions\r\nof billiard-tables, are a few of the thousand instances of its utility\r\nwhich might be quoted.\r\n\r\nWhen the proportion of sulphur mixed with the caoutchouc is increased to\r\n25 or 35 per cent., another product having qualities entirely different\r\nfrom those of vulcanized Indian-rubber is obtained when the mixture is\r\nheated. This is the jet-black substance termed _ebonite_ or _vulcanite_,\r\nwhich is made into such articles as combs, paper-knives, buttons, canes,\r\nportions of ornamental furniture, and plates of electrical machines. It\r\nis in many cases an excellent substitute for horn and for whalebone,\r\nwhile for insulating supports, &c., in electric apparatus, it is\r\nunrivalled. It has a full black colour and takes a bright polish; and it\r\nmay be cut, or filed, or moulded. It is very tough, hard, and durable.\r\nIn the transformation of Indian-rubber into vulcanite, the temperature\r\nmust be somewhat higher than that required for the production of the\r\nvulcanized Indian-rubber. The caoutchouc used is very carefully purified\r\nbefore it is incorporated with the sulphur; and the yellow paste formed\r\nby the mixture is subjected to the contact of steam at a temperature of\r\nabout 310°.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _GUTTA-PERCHA._\r\n\r\nGutta-percha is a substance very like Indian-rubber in its chemical\r\nproperties, having the same composition, although in outward appearance\r\nvery different. It was first sent to Europe in 1822, but did not become\r\nan article of commerce until 1844. It is the solidified juice of a tree\r\n(_Isonandra percha_) which abounds in Borneo and Malacca. The trunk of\r\nthe tree grows to a diameter of 6 ft., but as timber it is valueless.\r\nWhen an incision is made through the bark and into the wood, a milky\r\njuice flows out, which speedily solidifies. Gutta-percha is a very tough\r\nsubstance, but is without the elasticity of Indian-rubber. It differs\r\nfrom the latter, too, in becoming softened by a gentle heat, and it will\r\nthen readily take and retain any impressions with great sharpness and\r\nfidelity. Thus beautiful mouldings and other ornamental objects are\r\neasily made. It also has the valuable quality of welding when softened\r\nby heat. It is a non-conductor of electricity, and it is largely used\r\nfor covering telegraph-wires, and especially for forming an insulating\r\ncoating in submarine cables. It seems to have become known precisely at\r\nthe time it was required for this purpose, and the success of ocean\r\ntelegraphy is largely owing to its valuable properties. It is employed\r\nas a substitute for leather in soling shoes and boots, and in forming\r\nstraps and bands for driving machinery; also in the preparation of tubes\r\nused for conveying liquids, and for speaking-tubes. Dilute mineral acids\r\nhave no action upon it, and hence it is especially valuable for making\r\nbottles to contain hydrofluoric acid, which attacks glass. A drawback to\r\nthe use of gutta-percha is its tendency to become oxidized when exposed\r\nto light and air, by which it entirely loses its power of becoming\r\nplastic by heat, and is converted into a brittle substance. But in the\r\ndark, or under water, it may, however, be preserved for an indefinite\r\nperiod without change.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Hancock, in 1847, patented a machine for cutting the\r\ngutta-percha into slices. In this machine there is a circular iron\r\nplate, with three radial slots, in which knives are fixed somewhat in\r\nthe manner of the cutting tool of a spokeshave. The lumps of\r\ngutta-percha drop against these knives as the plate is driven round, and\r\nthe material is cut into slices, which have a thickness determined by\r\nthe projection which has been given to the blades. Sometimes an upright\r\nchopper is used, with straight or curved blades. These slices are\r\nimmersed in hot water, until they are softened, and they are then\r\nsubjected to the action of rollers armed with toothed blades, called\r\n“breakers,” and also to the action of the mincing cylinder, which is\r\nfurnished with radiating blades, and revolves partly immersed in the\r\nwater. The material is carried out of the hot water to these machines by\r\nendless webs mounted on rollers. The breakers and mincing cylinders make\r\nabout 800 revolutions per minute. The gutta-percha, thus reduced to\r\nfragments, is carried forward again by endless webs into cold water,\r\nwhere it is thoroughly washed and separated from the impurities, which\r\nfall to the bottom, while the lighter gutta-percha floats on the surface\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nGutta-percha, like caoutchouc, can be combined with sulphur. The best\r\nproduct is obtained when a small proportion of sulphur is used along\r\nwith some metallic sulphide. Mr. C. Hancock uses 48 parts of\r\ngutta-percha, 1 of sulphur, and 6 of antimony sulphide. These\r\ningredients are thoroughly mixed and put into a boiler, where they are\r\nheated under pressure for an hour or two. Another method of treating\r\ngutta-percha was also devised by Mr. C. Hancock, who found that when\r\nthis strange substance was exposed to nitric oxide gas (which is given\r\noff when nitric acid acts on copper) it became quite smooth, and\r\nacquired an almost metallic lustre, losing also all its stickiness.\r\nAnother modification is formed by treating gutta-percha with chloride of\r\nzinc; and yet another by the action of a solvent, such as turpentine, a\r\nsulphide, sulphur, and carbonate of ammonia, employed simultaneously.\r\nMr. Hancock mixes all these materials together in a “masticator,” and\r\nthen applies heat to them while confined in a vessel under pressure. The\r\nproduct of these operations is a very singular modification of\r\ngutta-percha, in which the material assumes a spongy, elastic condition,\r\nand in this form it is used to form the stuffing of sofas, easy chairs,\r\n&c. Among the purposes to which gutta-percha has been applied besides\r\nthe general one of waterproof tissues and fabrics, may be named the\r\nformation of straps, belts, bandages, cups, and other vessels, rollers\r\nfor cotton-spinning machinery, hammers of pianofortes, cards for\r\nwool-carding, hammercloths, life-preservers, and trusses.\r\n\r\nGutta-percha is made into strips, bands, cords, or threads of any\r\nrequired section, by passing sheets of suitable thickness between\r\nrollers provided with grooves and cutting edges. For strips and bands\r\nthe sheets are passed through the machine cold, and divided by the\r\ncutting-edges. But for round cords or threads sheets are supplied to the\r\nrollers from a receptacle in which they acquire a temperature of about\r\n200° F. The material is forced to take the form of the grooves, the\r\noperation in this case being analogous to that of rolling iron bars. The\r\ngutta-percha cords are received as they issue from the rollers in a tank\r\nof cold water, from which they pass on, to be wound on reels or drums.\r\nIt is obvious that cords of any section may be formed by making use of\r\ngrooves of suitable shape. Tubes of gutta-percha are made by forcing the\r\nsoftened substance out of an annular orifice: it is received into\r\nvessels filled with cold water. Telegraph-wires are covered by a similar\r\nprocess—the copper wire being made to pass through the centre of a\r\ncircular opening with the gutta-percha surrounding it. Picture-frames,\r\n&c., are made by forcibly pressing warm gutta-percha into the warmed\r\nmoulds. Gutta-percha tubing is largely used everywhere for the\r\nspeaking-tubes by which persons in remote apartments of even the largest\r\nbuilding can converse. This is one of the labour-saving inventions of\r\nour day. It must have struck every one who has seen these speaking-tubes\r\nin operation in a large establishment, what a vast amount of running to\r\nand fro they save, and how much they expedite business by the convenient\r\nmeans they afford of giving orders and directions to persons in distant\r\napartments. This tubing is also used for the conveyance of liquids, and\r\nit has been proposed to employ it instead of the ordinary leaden piping\r\nused for carrying water. It may seem to the reader that gutta-percha is\r\ntoo fragile a material to resist the pressure to which water-pipes are\r\nexposed. But, judging from some experiments made by the engineer of the\r\nBirmingham Waterworks, the power of gutta-percha tubing to resist\r\npressure is quite extraordinary, and far beyond what would be supposed.\r\nThe tubes experimented on had diameters of ¾ and ⅞th of an inch\r\nrespectively. The water from the main, where the pressure was that\r\ncaused by a head of 200ft., was in communication with these pipes for\r\nseveral weeks, and they were found unaltered in any way. In order to\r\ntest the strength of the tubes, and find the greatest pressure they\r\nwould bear, the engineer then had them connected with a hydraulic\r\nproving-pump; and here, when exposed to the highest pressure at which\r\nthe ordinary water-pipes were tested, namely, to 250 lbs. on the square\r\ninch, they also remained intact. The pressure was afterwards increased\r\nto 337 lbs., but without any damage to the tubes.\r\n\r\nThe increasing importance of gutta-percha may be inferred from the\r\ncontinually augmented importation of the crude substance into this\r\ncountry. In 1850 only 11,000 cwt. were imported, but the quantity has\r\nincreased year by year; and in 1872 we received nearly 46,000 cwt. The\r\ndemand is still increasing; but there is reason to apprehend that under\r\nthe stimulus of a rising market, the producers have collected the\r\ngutta-percha wastefully and with great destruction of the trees, so that\r\nit is not improbable that if the demand still increases, there may be a\r\ngutta-percha famine. The concreted juices of certain other trees have\r\nbeen proposed as substitutes for gutta-percha. None of these have as yet\r\ncome into practical use. The increase in a few years of the quantity of\r\nIndian-rubber imported into the United Kingdom is perhaps more\r\nextraordinary. From the tables given in Mr. Hancock’s book, it appears\r\nthat our imports of caoutchouc were 853,000 lbs. in 1850, but by 1855\r\nthey had amounted to 5,000,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 338.—_Portrait of Sir James Young Simpson, M.D._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ANÆSTHETICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discovery which is indicated by the somewhat unfamiliar word[16]\r\nwhich heads this article is perhaps the greatest which has ever been\r\nmade in connection with the science of medicine. At least, there is no\r\nother discovery of modern times which has so largely and directly\r\ncontributed to the assuagement of human suffering. Nay, in this respect\r\nthere is perhaps in the whole annals of the healing art no other which\r\ncan rival it, if we except that famous one of Jenner’s which has\r\narrested the ravages of small-pox. During the last thirty years, all the\r\nmore formidable operations of the surgeon have been, in almost every\r\ncase, performed with a happy unconsciousness on the part of the patient.\r\nIn unconsciousness, induced by the same means, has relief also been\r\nfound for severe suffering arising from other causes. The substances\r\nwhich are denoted by the word “anæsthetics” differ from the drugs which\r\nthe older surgeons sometimes administered before an operation, in order\r\nto lull the patient’s sense of pain. They differ in their nature and in\r\nthe mode of their administration; by the certainty and completeness of\r\ntheir action; by the entirely transient effects they produce, which pass\r\noff without leaving a trace.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  From α (αν), privative, and αισθητικος, capable of perceiving or\r\n  feeling.\r\n\r\nTo the great chemist whose name has already been mentioned as the\r\ndiscoverer of the metals of the alkalies and alkaline earths we are\r\nindebted for the first of the remarkable class of bodies we are about to\r\ndiscuss. The first work that Davy published had for its title\r\n“Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning Nitrous\r\nOxide and its Respiration.” This was in the year 1800, when the\r\nphilosopher had hardly completed his twenty-first year. The work caused\r\nno little sensation in the scientific world, and it was in consequence\r\nof the reputation he acquired by these researches that Davy was\r\nappointed to the chemical professorship at the Royal Institution. Davy\r\nwas not the original discoverer of nitrous oxide, but he first entered\r\nupon a full investigation of its properties, and announced the singular\r\neffect produced by its inhalation. The kind of transient intoxication\r\nand propensity to laughter which it excites have obtained for this\r\ncompound the familiar name of _laughing gas_. Davy had by experiment on\r\nhis own person proved the anæsthetic properties of this gas, for he had\r\na tooth painlessly extracted when under its influence, and he says in\r\nthe work above named that “as nitrous acid gas seems capable of\r\ndestroying pain, it could probably be used with advantage in surgical\r\noperations where there is no effusion of blood.” Davy’s observations and\r\nsuggestions were destined to lie barren for nearly half a century, but\r\nthey nevertheless formed the basis of the great results which have since\r\nbeen attained.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther, it will perhaps be well to make the\r\nunscientific reader acquainted with the chemistry of nitrous oxide. We\r\nmay presume that he knows that atmospheric air is a _mixture_ of the two\r\ninvisible gases, nitrogen and oxygen (the small quantity of carbonic\r\nacid also present need not now be considered). When a known quantity of\r\nair is passed over red-hot copper turnings, contained in a tube, the\r\nwhole of the oxygen is seized upon by the copper, and only the nitrogen\r\nissues from the tube, and may be collected. Some of the copper is thus\r\nconverted into oxide, and the increase of the weight of the tube’s\r\ncontents shows the weight of oxygen contained in the air, while the\r\nweight of nitrogen may be known from the volume collected. In this way\r\nthe chemist analyses atmospheric air, and determines that 100 parts by\r\nweight of dry air contain about 79 of nitrogen and 21 of oxygen; or, by\r\nmeasure, about four times as much of the former as of the latter. Now,\r\nchemists are acquainted with no fewer than five _different_ substances\r\nwhich contain nothing but nitrogen and oxygen. These substances are\r\neither gases, or can be changed into the gaseous form by heat, and they\r\ncan all be analysed in the same manner as air. The results of such\r\nanalyses show in 100 parts by weight of each substance the following\r\nproportions of its constituents:\r\n\r\n             ┌────────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐\r\n             │        │No. 1.│No. 2.│No. 3.│No. 4.│No. 5.│\r\n             ├────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤\r\n             │Nitrogen│63·64 │46·67 │36·84 │30·44 │25·93 │\r\n             │Oxygen  │36·36 │53·33 │63·16 │69·56 │74·07 │\r\n             └────────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘\r\n\r\nIn casting the eye over this table, no relation will probably be\r\ndetected between the five cases. But if we write down, not the\r\nquantities of nitrogen and oxygen contained in 100 parts of each\r\ncompound, but the quantity of oxygen which in each compound is united to\r\nsome fixed quantity of nitrogen, we shall at once detect a remarkable\r\nlaw: thus, taking 28 as the fixed weight of nitrogen, for reasons which\r\nneed not be here explained:\r\n\r\n             ┌────────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐\r\n             │        │No. 1.│No. 2.│No. 3.│No. 4.│No. 5.│\r\n             ├────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┤\r\n             │Nitrogen│  28  │  28  │  28  │  28  │  28  │\r\n             │{Oxygen │  16  │  32  │  48  │  64  │  80  │\r\n             │{    or │16 × 1│16 × 2│16 × 3│16 × 4│16 × 5│\r\n             └────────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘\r\n\r\nChemists have a sort of shorthand method of expressing the composition\r\nof substances, which may be conveniently illustrated by the case before\r\nus. Let it be agreed that the letter N shall not only represent\r\nnitrogen, but always _fourteen_ parts by weight—grains, ounces, &c.,\r\n&c.,—of nitrogen; and that, similarly, O shall stand for _sixteen_ parts\r\nby weight of oxygen. It is plain that the composition of the compound\r\nNo. 2 may be represented by simply writing down “NO;” and that of No. 4,\r\nin which there is just double the proportion of oxygen, by “NOO.” But to\r\navoid an unnecessary repetition of the same symbol, when it has to be\r\ntaken more than once, a small figure is written after and a little below\r\nit. Thus, for OO, “O_{2}” is written. The proportional composition of\r\neach of the five compounds will now be obvious from the following\r\nsymbols:\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │   No. 1.   │   No. 2.   │   No. 3.   │   No. 4.   │   No. 5.   │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │   N_{2}O   │     NO     │ N_{2}O_{3} │   NO_{2}   │ N_{2}O_{5} │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nThese symbols may be regarded as merely a compendious expression of the\r\ncomposition of each substance—as a shorthand statement of the _facts_ of\r\nanalysis. But to the majority of chemists the symbols have a deeper\r\nsignificance; for they are taken as representing the _atoms_ of each\r\nelement which enter into each smallest possible particle of a compound;\r\nthey express a certain theory of the ultimate constitution of matter.\r\nThus, if we suppose that there exist indivisible particles of nitrogen\r\nand of oxygen, and that each smallest particle, or _molecule_, of the\r\ncompounds under consideration is constituted of a certain definite and\r\ninvariable number of each kind of atoms; and, further, if we suppose\r\nthat an _atom_ of oxygen is heavier than one of nitrogen in the\r\nproportion of 16 to 14, or 8 to 7, we shall have a simple theoretical\r\n_explanation_ of the relations in the proportions already pointed out.\r\nIn fact, these would result from the simplest combinations of the two\r\nkinds of _atoms_; and we can picture each one of the smallest particles\r\nof the several bodies as thus constituted:\r\n\r\n   ┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐\r\n   │   No. 1.   │   No. 2.   │   No. 3.   │   No. 4.   │   No. 5.   │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │    ● ●     │            │    ● ●     │     ●      │    ● ●     │\r\n   │     ○      │    ● ○     │   ○ ○ ○    │    ○ ○     │   ○ ○ ○    │\r\n   │            │            │            │            │    ○ ○     │\r\n   ├────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────┤\r\n   │   N_{2}O   │     NO     │ N_{2}O_{3} │   NO_{2}   │ N_{2}O_{5} │\r\n   └────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘\r\n\r\nThe black circles represent nitrogen atoms, and the open ones oxygen\r\natoms; the symbols are placed below in order that their relation to the\r\nsupposed atomic constitution may be obvious at a glance. While the\r\nsymbol of a compound must always accord with its percentage composition,\r\nthe latter does of itself determine the symbol or formula. A number of\r\nother circumstances, which cannot here be discussed, are taken into\r\naccount as evidence of the constitution of the molecule.\r\n\r\nThis digression on chemical formulæ will, it is hoped, enable the\r\ngeneral reader, who may not previously have been acquainted with them,\r\nto perceive their significance, instead of passing them over as\r\nunintelligible cabalistic letters when they occur in the following\r\npages. With this object, it may be added that the elements, hydrogen,\r\ncarbon, and chlorine, are respectively represented by H, C, and Cl; and\r\nthat the proportional quantities, which are also implied in the symbols,\r\nand are those by which H, C, and Cl combine with other bodies, are 1,\r\n12, and 35·5 respectively. Another point which should be understood is\r\nthat the properties and behaviour of a chemical compound are different,\r\nand usually extremely different, from those of any of its constituents.\r\nThis is well illustrated in the subject we are considering. Atmospheric\r\nair is a _mixture_ (not a compound) of nitrogen and oxygen gases, and\r\nall its properties are intermediate between those of its ingredients\r\ntaken separately. Nitrous oxide, N_{2}O, has properties not possessed by\r\neither constituent separately. For example, it is very soluble in water,\r\nwhereas oxygen is very slightly so, and nitrogen still less. The other\r\ncompounds we have referred to differ widely from nitrous oxide and from\r\neach other in their properties.\r\n\r\nNitrous oxide is an invisible gas, having a slightly sweetish taste and\r\nsmell. It is dissolved by water, which, at ordinary temperatures, takes\r\nup about three-fourths of its volume of the gas. By cold and great\r\npressure the gas may be condensed into a colourless liquid. The gas is\r\nobtained in a pure state by gently heating the salt called ammonium\r\nnitrate, which is formed by neutralizing pure nitric acid with carbonate\r\nof ammonia. The action which occurs may be explained thus: the hydrogen\r\nof the ammonium unites with a portion of the oxygen of the nitric acid,\r\nforming water, whilst the remainder of the oxygen combines with the\r\nnitrogen. As chemical actions are regarded as either separations or\r\nunions of atoms, they can be expressed by what is called a _chemical\r\nequation_, the left-hand side of which shows the arrangement of the\r\natoms before the action, and the right-hand side the arrangement after\r\nit, the sign of equality being read as “produce” or “produces.” But the\r\nvalidity of the equations, like that of the symbolic formulæ, is quite\r\nindependent of the existence of atoms; for the equation always rests on\r\ncertain facts, namely, the relations between the quantities of the\r\nsubstances which enter into, and those which are produced by, a chemical\r\naction. Thus, in the present case the action may be symbolically\r\nexpressed as follows:\r\n\r\n                H_{4}N NO_{3}   = 2H_{2}O +     N_{2}O\r\n              Ammonium nitrate.   Water.    Nitrous oxide.\r\n\r\nThe equation expresses the fact that every 80 parts by weight of\r\nammonium nitrate, which are used in this reaction, split up into 36 of\r\nwater and 44 of nitrous oxide.\r\n\r\nNo attempt seems to have been made to turn Davy’s suggestion to\r\npractical account; but in courses of chemical lectures at the hospitals\r\nand elsewhere the peculiar physiological properties of nitrous oxide\r\nhave, since Davy’s announcement, always been demonstrated by some person\r\ninhaling the gas. In the medical schools the students often operated on\r\na comrade who was under the influence of nitrous oxide to the extent of\r\nbestowing sundry pinches and cuffs, which fully proved the anæsthetic\r\nqualities of the nitrous oxide. In 1818 Faraday pointed out the\r\nsimilarity between the effects of _ether_ and of nitrous oxide, and from\r\nthat time Professor Turner regularly included among the experiments of\r\nhis course of chemistry the inhalation of the vapour of ether by one of\r\nthe students. This was done by simply pouring a little ether into a\r\nbladder of air, and by means of a tube drawing the mixed air and vapour\r\ninto the mouth. Until 1844 the effects of nitrous oxide and of ether\r\nvapour remained without application, although thus continually\r\ndemonstrated in lectures. At the close of that year, Mr. Horace Wells, a\r\ndentist, of Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.A., witnessed the usual\r\nexperiments with nitrous oxide at a public lecture. At his request the\r\nlecturer attended at Mr. Wells’s residence the following day, to\r\nadminister to him the nitrous oxide, in order that he might try its\r\nefficacy in annulling pain, for he was himself to have a tooth extracted\r\nby a brother dentist. His exclamation on finding the operation\r\npainlessly over was, “A new era in tooth-pulling!” Mr. Wells continued\r\nhis experiments on the use of nitrous oxide in dental operations, but he\r\ndid not apparently obtain uniform results, for he pronounced its effects\r\nuncertain, and he gave it up. On the occasion when Mr. Wells’s tooth was\r\nextracted, Dr. W. T. G. Morton was present, and he soon afterwards found\r\nthat under the influence of ether vapour, teeth might be painlessly\r\nextracted and surgical operations performed. Dr. Morton attempted to\r\nconceal the substance he used under the name of “letheon,” for which he\r\nobtained a patent. But the well-known and characteristic odour of ether\r\ndeclared the nature of the “letheon;” and Dr. Bigelow having in\r\nconsequence tried ether, found it to produce all the effects of\r\n“letheon.” So the matter was no longer a secret. Dr. Morton was,\r\ntherefore, the person who first applied ether vapour, and the extraction\r\nof a tooth was the occasion of its first application. This was in 1846.\r\nIt was used for the first time in England on the 19th of December, 1846,\r\nalso for the extraction of a tooth; and two days afterwards Mr. Liston,\r\nthe eminent surgeon, performed the operation of amputating the thigh\r\nwhile his patient was under the influence of ether. The employment of\r\nether in surgical operations quickly spread, and its administration in\r\nhospitals became general throughout Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThe chemical constitution of ether, and its relation to alcohol, may be\r\nindicated by the following formulæ:\r\n\r\n             HOH   HO(C_{2}H_{5}) (C_{2}H_{5})O(C_{2}H_{5})\r\n            Water.    Alcohol.             Ether.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose one of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule of water to be\r\nremoved and replaced by the group (C_{2}H_{5}), the result is alcohol.\r\nIf, now, (C_{2}H_{5}) be substituted in the alcohol for the remaining\r\natom of hydrogen, we get a particle of _ether_. Ether was discovered in\r\n1540, and described as sweet oil of vitriol, but its real nature was\r\nfirst pointed out by Liebig. It is prepared by distilling a mixture of\r\nsulphuric acid and alcohol. It is a colourless transparent liquid,\r\nextremely volatile, and possessing a peculiar and powerful odour. It\r\nevaporates so rapidly that a drop allowed to fall from a bottle on a\r\nwarm day may be converted into vapour before it reaches the ground. When\r\nits vapour is inhaled in sufficient proportion mixed with air, it soon\r\nproduces a complete insensibility to pain. In the case of a full-grown\r\nman who inhales air containing 45 per cent. of the vapour, about 2 drams\r\nper minute of the liquid are consumed. The air is allowed to stream over\r\nthe surface of the liquid in a proper apparatus, where it takes up the\r\nvapour, and the two pass through a flexible tube to a piece fitting over\r\nthe mouth and nostrils of the patient. The effects produced are\r\nprogressive, and may be thus described:\r\n\r\nFor about two minutes after the beginning of the inhalation, the patient\r\nretains his mental faculties, and has some power of controlling his\r\nmovements, but in a confused and disordered manner. At the end of the\r\nthird minute he is unconscious; there are no voluntary movements, but\r\nmuscular contractions may agitate the frame. At the end of the fourth\r\nminute, the only perceptible movements are the motions of the chest in\r\nrespiration. If the inhalation be discontinued at the end of the fourth\r\nminute, when 1 oz. of ether will have evaporated, similar stages are\r\npassed through in reverse order during recovery. The condition reached\r\nat the end of the fourth minute continues about two minutes; the\r\nintermediate state lasts three or four minutes; the condition of\r\nconfused intellect and will about five minutes. This is succeeded by a\r\nfeeling of intoxication and exhilaration, which continues for ten or\r\nfifteen minutes. It was probably this excitement of the system produced\r\nby ether which has caused it to be superseded—in Britain, at least—in\r\nabout twelve months after its adoption, by _chloroform_.\r\n\r\nChloroform appears to have been independently discovered in 1831, by\r\nSoubeiran, and by an American chemist, Guthrie. It is usually procured\r\nby distilling a mixture of bleaching powder, spirits of wine, and water.\r\nChloroform is a colourless volatile liquid, of an odour much more\r\nagreeable than that of ether. Its composition is represented by\r\nCHCl_{3}. The merit of having first applied the singular properties of\r\nthis substance to the alleviation of human suffering belongs to the late\r\nSir J. Y. Simpson, of Edinburgh. Its use as an anæsthetic was apparently\r\nsuggested to this eminent professor by Mr. Waldie, of Liverpool. It was\r\nfirst applied at Edinburgh on the 15th November, 1847; and when its\r\nefficacy had been proved, it was soon extensively used, and in Europe,\r\nat least, almost entirely superseded ether, as being more rapid and\r\ncertain in its action, not producing injurious excitement, and being\r\npleasanter to inhale. A notion prevailed that chloroform was not only\r\nmore powerful in its operation than ether, but also more safe. In\r\nJanuary, 1848, its administration, however, proved fatal to a patient;\r\nand since then a certain number of casualties of this kind have occurred\r\nwith chloroform, ether, and other anæsthetics.\r\n\r\nThe patient is often made to inhale the vapour of chloroform by merely\r\nholding before his mouth and nostrils a sponge or handkerchief, on which\r\na small quantity of the liquid has been poured. Dr. Snow contrived an\r\napparatus for administering the vapour with more regularity. A metal box\r\nadapted to the shape of the face is made to cover the mouth and\r\nnostrils. This piece has two valves, one of which admits the air and\r\nvapour from an elastic tube connected with the apparatus containing the\r\nchloroform, and prevents its return; the other valve is a flap opening\r\noutwards, which allows the expired air to escape. There is also an\r\nadjustment for admitting directly into the mouthpiece more or less\r\natmospheric air.\r\n\r\nThe sensations first experienced when chloroform is inhaled are said to\r\nbe agreeable. Many persons have described the feeling as resembling\r\nrapid travelling in a railway carriage; there is a singing in the ears,\r\nand when the power of vision ceases, and the person is no longer\r\nconscious of light, the sensation is that of entering a tunnel. After\r\nthis there is a lessened sensibility to pain; and in the next stage the\r\nunconsciousness to outward impressions is deeper, but the mental\r\nfaculties, though impaired, are not wholly suspended, for the patient\r\nmay speak, and usually dreams something which he afterwards remembers.\r\nWhen the person is still more under the influence of the chloroform, no\r\nvoluntary motions take place, although there may be some inarticulate\r\nmuttering. Dr. Snow describes several conditions which may be observed\r\nin patients undergoing operations under the influence of chloroform.\r\nFirst, the patient may preserve the most perfect quietude without a sign\r\nof consciousness or sensation; this is the most usual condition. Second,\r\nhe may moan, or cry, or flinch under the operation, without, however,\r\nhaving the least memory of any pain when he recovers. Third, the patient\r\nmay talk, laugh, or sing during the operation; but what he says is\r\naltogether devoid of reference to what is done. Fourth, he may be\r\nconscious of what is taking place, and may look on while some minor\r\noperation is proceeding, without feeling it, or without feeling it\r\npainfully. This is often the condition of the patient as the effect is\r\npassing off, while some smaller operation is still proceeding. Fifth,\r\nthe patient may complain he is being hurt; but afterwards, when the\r\neffect of the chloroform has passed off, he will assert that he felt no\r\npain whatever. When the chloroform has been inhaled for but a short\r\ntime, the patient becomes conscious in about five minutes after its\r\ndiscontinuance; but with a longer inhalation the period of\r\nunconsciousness may last for perhaps ten minutes. The return of\r\nconsciousness takes place with tranquillity: not unfrequently the\r\npatient’s first speech, even after a serious operation, often being an\r\nassertion that the chloroform has not taken effect.\r\n\r\nIn the strongest degree of ether and chloroform effects, all the muscles\r\nof the body are relaxed; the limbs hang down, or rest in any position in\r\nwhich they are placed; the eyelids droop over the eyes, or remain as\r\nthey are placed by the finger; the breathing is deep, regular, and\r\nautomatic; there is often snoring, and this is, indeed, characteristic\r\nof the deepest degree of unconsciousness; the relaxation of the muscles\r\nrenders the face devoid of expression, and with a placid appearance, as\r\nif the person were in a sound natural sleep. He is perfectly passive\r\nunder every kind of operation. The breathing and the action of the heart\r\nproceed all the while with unimpaired regularity. It is, however, known\r\nby experiments on animals that if the inhalation be prolonged beyond the\r\nperiod necessary to produce these effects, the respiratory functions are\r\ninterfered with by the insensibility extending to the nerves on which\r\nthey depend. The breathing of an animal thus treated becomes irregular,\r\nfeeble, or laborious, and death ensues. However nearly dead from\r\ninhalation of ether vapour the animal may be, provided respiration has\r\nnot actually ceased, it always recovers when allowed to breathe fresh\r\nair. Of course, the etherization is never carried to this stage with\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nAir containing 2 grs. of chloroform in 100 cubic inches suffices to\r\ninduce insensibility; but 5 grs. in 100 cubic inches is found a more\r\nsuitable proportion. Dr. Snow, who strongly disapproved of the uncertain\r\nand irregular mode of administering chloroform on a handkerchief or\r\nsponge, contrived the inhaling apparatus already described. The air\r\nbefore reaching the mouth and nostrils of the patient passes through a\r\nvessel containing bibulous paper moistened with chloroform. This vessel\r\nhe surrounds with water at the ordinary temperature of the air, in order\r\nto supply the heat absorbed by the conversion of the liquid into vapour,\r\nso that the formation of the latter may go on regularly. The same\r\nthoughtful arrangement formed part of the ether-inhaler he had\r\npreviously contrived.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary effects of ether and chloroform have introduced new\r\nand important facts into psychological science, and have illustrated and\r\nextended some of the most interesting results of physiological research.\r\nLet us trace the action of these substances, and explain it as far as\r\nmay be. Nitrous oxide, ether vapour, and chloroform vapour are all\r\nsoluble in watery fluids. The lungs present a vast surface bathed by\r\nwatery fluids, and therefore these gases are largely absorbed; and by a\r\nwell-known process, they pass directly into the blood, through the\r\ndelicate walls of the capillary vessels. The odour of ether can be\r\ndetected in any blood drawn from persons under its influence. Ether, or\r\nchloroform, thus brought into the general current of the circulation, is\r\nquickly carried to all parts of the body, and thus reaches the\r\nnerve-centres. On these it produces characteristic effects by suspending\r\nor paralysing nervous action: why or how this effect takes place is\r\nunknown. The nervous centres are not all acted upon in an equal\r\ndegree—some require a larger quantity of the drug to affect them at all.\r\nThe parts of the nervous system first affected are the cerebral lobes,\r\nwhich are known to be the seat of the intellectual powers. The\r\n_cerebellum_—the function of which there is reason to believe is the\r\nregulation and coordination of movements—is the next to yield to the\r\ninfluence. Then follow the spinal nerves, which are the seat of\r\nsensibility and motive power. This is as far as the action can safely be\r\ncarried: the nervous centre called the _medulla oblongata_, which is\r\nplaced at the junction of the brain and the spinal cord, still performs\r\nits functions—one of the most important of which is to produce the\r\nmuscular contractions that keep the respiratory organs in action. We\r\nhave seen, by the effects of further etherization in animals, that when\r\nthis part of the system is affected, the animal dies from a stoppage of\r\nthe respiration.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, there have been instances in which death has been\r\ncaused by the administration of ether and chloroform even under the most\r\nskilful management. But these occurrences were not the result of the\r\ninhalation having been carried so far as to stop respiration: in some\r\ncases the patient has died before the first stage of insensibility.\r\nThese fatal cases have all been marked by a sudden paralysis of the\r\nheart—that organ has abruptly ceased to act. Why in these, certainly a\r\nvery small percentage of patients, the action of the drug should at once\r\ntake effect on the heart has not yet been explained. The rhythmic action\r\nof the heart depends upon nervous centres enclosed within its own\r\nsubstance, so that this organ is to a certain extent independent; but it\r\nis connected with the other nervous centres by the branches of a\r\nremarkable nerve which proceeds from the _medulla oblongata_, and also\r\nby another set of nerves which come from the chain of ganglia called the\r\n_sympathetic nerve_. The nerve connecting the heart with the _medulla_\r\nis a branch of that called the _pneumo-gastric_, and it is a\r\nwell-established fact that the action of the heart may be arrested by\r\nirritation of this nerve. The comparatively few fatalities which have\r\nattended the use of anæsthetics may, therefore, be due either to an\r\nimmediate action on the nerve-centres of the heart, or possibly to a\r\nmediate action through the _medulla_ and the pneumo-gastric nerve.\r\n\r\nSoon after the introduction of ether the use of nitrous oxide was\r\ndiscontinued by the dentists, on account of the apparent uncertainty of\r\nits action. Within the last few years, however, its employment in the\r\nextraction of teeth has been revived by Dr. Evans, of Paris, who found\r\nthat to insure certainty in its action, the great point is the\r\ninhalation of the gas in a pure state and without admixture of air.\r\nNitrous oxide seems now to be extensively used by dentists, and thus\r\nDavy’s experiment of 1800 is repeated and verified daily in thousands of\r\ncases, and to the great relief of hundreds who probably never heard his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nOther bodies, such as amylene (C_{5}H_{10}), carbon tetrachloride\r\n(CCl_{4}), &c., have been tried as substitutes for ether and chloroform;\r\nbut having been found less efficacious or more dangerous, their use has\r\nbeen abandoned. It might be instructive to reflect how much unnecessary\r\npain would have been spared to mankind had ether and chloroform been\r\nknown and applied at an earlier age. We know not what other beneficent\r\ngifts chemistry may yet have in store for the alleviation of suffering,\r\nbut it is unlikely that even ether and chloroform are her _derniers\r\nmots_. It should be remembered that the chemists who discovered and\r\nexamined these bodies were attracted to the work by nothing but the love\r\nof their science. They had no idea how invaluable these substances would\r\nafterwards prove. The chemist of the present day, whose labour is often\r\nits own reward, may be cheered and stimulated in his toil by the thought\r\nthat while no discovery is ever lost, but goes to fill its appropriate\r\nplace in the great edifice of science, even the most apparently\r\ninsignificant truth may directly lead to invaluable results for humanity\r\nat large.\r\n\r\nWhat strange things the ancient thaumaturgists might have done had they\r\nbeen possessed of the secret of chloroform or of nitrous oxide! What\r\nmiracles they would have wrought—what dogmas they would have sanctioned\r\nby its aid! But the remarkable effects produced by the inhalation of\r\ncertain gases or vapours were not altogether unknown to the\r\nancients—although these effects were then attributed to anything but\r\ntheir real cause. It is related that a number of goats feeding on Mount\r\nParnassus came near a place where there was a deep fissure in the earth,\r\nand thereupon began to caper and frisk about in the most extraordinary\r\nmanner. The goatherd observing this, was tempted to look down into the\r\nhole, to see what could have caused so extraordinary an effect. He was\r\nhimself immediately seized with a fit of delirium, and uttered wild and\r\nextravagant words, which were supposed to be prophecies. The knowledge\r\nof the presumed divine inspiration spread abroad, and at length a temple\r\nin honour of Apollo was erected on the spot. Such was the origin of the\r\nfamous Oracle of Delphi, where the Pythoness, the priestess of Apollo,\r\nseated on a tripod placed over the mysterious opening, delivered the\r\nresponse of the god to such as came to consult the oracle. It is stated\r\nby the ancient writers, that when she had inhaled the vapour, her eyes\r\nsparkled, convulsive shudders ran through her frame, and then she\r\nuttered with loud cries the words of the oracle, while the priests who\r\nattended took down her incoherent expressions, and _set them in order_.\r\nThese possessions by the spirit of divination were sometimes violent.\r\nPlutarch mentions a priestess whose frenzy was so furious, that the\r\npriests and the inquirers alike fled terrified from the temple; and the\r\nfit was so protracted that the unfortunate priestess herself died a few\r\ndays afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 339.—_A Railway Cutting._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXPLOSIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illustration above will serve to remind the reader of the great\r\nimportance of explosive agents in the operations of civil industry. By\r\nreason of the more impressive and exciting spectacles which attend the\r\nuse of such agents in warfare, we are rather apt to lose sight of their\r\nfar more extensive utility as the giant forces whose aid man invokes\r\nwhen he wishes to rend the rock in order to make a road for his steam\r\nhorse, or in order to penetrate into the bowels of the earth in search\r\nof the precious ore. A little reflection will show that if such work had\r\nto be done with only the pickaxe, the chisel, and the crowbar, the\r\nprogress would be painfully slow; and railway cuttings through masses of\r\ncompact limestone, like that represented in Fig. 339, for example, would\r\nbe well-nigh impossible. The formation of cuttings and tunnels, and the\r\nremoval of rocks in mining operations, are not the only service which\r\nexplosive agents render to the industrial arts; there is, besides other\r\nuses which might be enumerated, the preparation of foundations for\r\nbuildings, bridges, harbours, and lighthouses. The use of gunpowder in\r\nall such operations as those which have been referred to is too well\r\nknown to require description. But of late years gunpowder has been to a\r\ngreat extent superseded for such purposes by two remarkable products of\r\nmodern chemistry, called _gun-cotton_ and _nitro-glycerine_. Military\r\nart has also benefited by at least one of these products; and the use of\r\ncharges of gun-cotton for torpedoes has already been described and\r\nillustrated in these pages.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little curious that the two most terribly powerful\r\nexplosives known to science should be prepared from two most harmless\r\nand familiar substances. The nice, soft, clean, gentle cotton-wool, in\r\nwhich ladies wrap their most delicate trinkets, becomes, by a simple\r\nchemical transformation, a tremendously powerful explosive; and the\r\nclear, sweet, bland liquid, glycerine, which they value as a cosmetic\r\nfor its emollient properties, becomes, by a like transformation, a still\r\nmore terrifically powerful explosive than the former. It is, perhaps,\r\neven more curious that having undergone the transformation which confers\r\nupon it these formidable qualities, neither cotton-wool nor glycerine is\r\nchanged in appearance. The former remains white and fleecy; the latter\r\nis still a colourless syrupy-looking liquid.\r\n\r\nThe fibres which form cotton, linen, paper, and wood, are composed\r\nalmost entirely of a substance which is known to the chemist as\r\n_cellulose_ or _cellulin_. That this substance, as it exists in the\r\nfibres of linen and in sawdust, could be converted into an explosive\r\nbody by the action of nitric acid, appears to have been first observed\r\nby the French chemist, Pelouze, in 1838. The action with cellulose in\r\nthe form of cotton-wool was more fully examined by Professor Schönbein,\r\nof Basle, who, in 1846, first described the method of preparing\r\n_gun-cotton_, and suggested some uses for it. He directs that one part\r\nof finely-carded cotton-wool should be immersed in fifteen parts of a\r\nmixture of equal measures of strong sulphuric and nitric acids; that\r\nafter the cotton has remained in the mixture for a few minutes, it\r\nshould be removed, plunged in cold water, and washed until every trace\r\nof acid has been removed, and then carefully dried at a temperature not\r\nexceeding the boiling-point of water.\r\n\r\nAfter Professor Schönbein had demonstrated the power of the new agent in\r\nblasting, and its projectile force in fire-arms, its manufacture on a\r\nlarge scale was undertaken at several places. Messrs. Hall commenced to\r\nmake it at their gunpowder works at Faversham, and a manufactory was\r\nalso established near Paris. In July, 1847, a fearful explosion of\r\ngun-cotton occurred at the Faversham works, which was believed to have\r\nbeen caused by the spontaneous detonation of that substance. This\r\ninduced Messrs. Hall to discontinue the manufacture as too dangerous;\r\nand they even destroyed a large quantity of the product which they had\r\nin hand by burying it in the ground. The making of gun-cotton was soon\r\nafterwards discontinued also by the French, who did not find the\r\nsubstance to possess all the qualities fitting it for military use. The\r\nPrussian Government also began to make gun-cotton; but the experiments\r\nwere put a stop to by the explosion of their factory. An eminent\r\nartillery officer in the Austrian service, General von Lenk, undertook a\r\nthorough examination of the manufacture and properties of gun-cotton for\r\nmilitary purposes. He introduced several improvements into the processes\r\nof the manufacture; and the Austrian Government established works at\r\nHïrtenberg, with a view to the adoption of gun-cotton as a substitute\r\nfor gunpowder in fire-arms. It has some undoubted advantages over\r\npowder, for it neither heats the gun nor fouls it, and it produces no\r\nsmoke. Notwithstanding this the Austrians have not abandoned the use of\r\ngunpowder in favour of gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nGun-cotton, as a military agent, has a strenuous advocate in Professor\r\nAbel, who presides over the Chemical Department of the British War\r\nOffice. To this gentleman we are indebted for great improvements in the\r\nmanufacture of gun-cotton, and for a more complete investigation of its\r\nproperties. Professor Abel’s processes were put in practice at a\r\nmanufactory which the Government established at Waltham Abbey; and\r\nMessrs. Prentice also set up works at Stowmarket.\r\n\r\nSome details of the mode in which the manufacture of gun-cotton was\r\ncarried on at Stowmarket may be of interest. The cotton was first\r\nthoroughly cleansed and carefully dried; and these operations are of\r\ngreat importance, for unless they are well performed, the product is\r\nliable to explode spontaneously. The cotton was then weighed out in\r\ncharges of 1 lb., and each charge was completely immersed in a separate\r\nvessel, containing a cold mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids. After a\r\nshort immersion the cotton was removed from the liquid, and with about\r\nten times its own weight of acids adhering to it, each charge was placed\r\nin a separate jar, where it was allowed to remain for forty-eight hours.\r\nThe vessels were kept cool during the whole period by being placed in a\r\ntrough through which cold water was flowing. On removal from the jars,\r\nthe cotton was freed from adhering acid by being placed in a centrifugal\r\ndrying machine. It was then drenched with a large quantity of cold\r\nwater, and dried, washed again in a stream of cold water for forty-eight\r\nhours, and the operations of alternately washing for forty-eight hours\r\nand drying were repeated eight times. The drying was effected by placing\r\nthe material in cylinders of wire-gauze, which were whirled round by a\r\nsteam engine at the rate of 800 revolutions per minute, so that the\r\nwater was expelled by centrifugal force. The cotton was next reduced to\r\na pulp by a process similar to that which is employed in paper-making,\r\nand the moist pulp was rammed into metallic cylinders by hydraulic\r\npressure, in order that it might be brought into forms suitable for use\r\nin blasting, &c. The pulp was put into these moulds while wet, but the\r\nwater was nearly all expelled by the compression. The cylinders of\r\ngun-cotton thus obtained were then covered with paper-parchment, and\r\nfinally dried at a steam temperature, with many precautions. The\r\ncompression of the cotton pulp, by bringing a large quantity of the\r\nmaterial into a smaller bulk, causes a greater concentration of the\r\nexplosive energy, and this is a matter of great importance in blasting.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider what chemistry has to teach concerning the nature of\r\nthe action by which cotton-wool is converted into gun-cotton. Cotton\r\nitself is nearly pure cellulose. The chemical composition of cellulose\r\nmay be represented most simply by the formula C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}. Nitric\r\nacid is a powerful oxidizing agent, and is constantly used in chemistry\r\nto fix oxygen in various substances; but another kind of action exerted\r\nby nitric acid in certain cases consists in the substitution of a\r\nportion of its atoms for hydrogen, by which the residue of the particle\r\nof nitric acid is converted into water. The formula for nitric acid may\r\nbe written HO NO_{2}, and it will be seen that by changing NO_{2} for H,\r\nwater, HOH, would be produced. This is precisely the kind of action\r\nwhich occurs when cellulose is converted into _nitro-cellulose_. Two or\r\nthree, or more, atoms of hydrogen may be taken out of cellulose, and\r\nreplaced by two or three, or more, groups NO_{2}, and the result will be\r\na different kind of _nitro-cellulose_, according to the number of atoms\r\nin the molecule replaced by NO_{2}. Several varieties of gun-cotton are\r\nknown, these being doubtless the result of the differences here alluded\r\nto. The action producing di-nitro-cellulose is represented by this\r\nequation:\r\n\r\n C_{6}H_{10}O_{5} +   2HNO_{3}   = C_{6}H_{8}(NO_{2})_{2}O_{5} + 2H_{2}O.\r\n    Cellulose.      Nitric acid.       Di-nitro-cellulose.        Water.\r\n\r\nThe equation shows that water is produced by the reaction, and the\r\nsulphuric acid which is used in the preparation performs no further part\r\nthan to take up this water, which would otherwise go to dilute the rest\r\nof the nitric acid. The union of sulphuric acid and water is attended\r\nwith great heat, hence the necessity of cooling the vessels in making\r\nthe gun-cotton. Quite other products would be formed if the mixture\r\nbecame heated.\r\n\r\nThe action of nitric acid on glycerine is of the same kind as that on\r\ncellulose. When glycerine is allowed to drop into a cooled mixture of\r\nnitric acid and sulphuric acid, the eye can detect little or no\r\ndifference between the appearance of the liquid which collects in the\r\nbottom of the vessel and the glycerine dropped in. The product of the\r\naction is, however, the terrible _nitro-glycerine_, a heavy,\r\noily-looking liquid, which explodes with fearful violence. Even a\r\nsingle drop placed on a piece of paper, and struck on an anvil,\r\ndetonates violently and with a deafening report. The chemical change\r\nwhich is effected in the glycerine (C_{3}H_{8}O_{3}), is the\r\nsubstitution of three NO_{2} groups for three of hydrogen, producing\r\nC_{3}H_{5}(NO_{2})_{3}O_{3}, or tri-nitro-glycerine. The general\r\nreader may perhaps marvel that the chemist should be able not only to\r\ncount the number of atoms which go to make up the particles of a\r\ncompound body, but to say that they are arranged so and so: that the\r\natoms do not form an indiscriminate heap, but that they are connected\r\nin an assignable manner. The reader is no doubt aware that these\r\ncompound particles are extremely small, and he may reasonably wonder\r\nhow science can pronounce upon the structure of things so small. He\r\nmay be more perplexed to learn that a calculation made by Sir W.\r\nThompson shows that the particles of water, for instance, cannot\r\npossibly be more than the 1/250000000th of an inch in diameter, and\r\nmay be only 1/20th of that size. The truth is that the very existence\r\nof atoms and molecules is an assumption. Like the undulatory ether, it\r\nis an hypothesis which is adopted to simplify and connect our ideas,\r\nand not a demonstrated reality. But the atomic hypothesis has so wide\r\na scope that some philosophers hold the existence of atoms and\r\nmolecules as almost a known fact. Be that as it may, the chemist in\r\nassigning to a body a certain _molecular formula_ really does nothing\r\nbut express the results of certain experiments he has made upon it.\r\nWith one re-agent it is decomposed in this manner, with another in\r\nthat. By certain treatment it yields an acid, a salt; so much carbonic\r\nacid, such a weight of water, is acted on or remains unaltered; gives\r\na precipitate or refuses to do so. Such are the _facts_ which the\r\nchemist conceives are co-ordinated and expressed by the formula he\r\ngives to a substance. The best formula is that which accords with the\r\ngreatest number of the properties of the body—which includes as many\r\nof the facts as possible. It follows, therefore, that a formula which\r\naims at expressing more than the mere percentage composition of the\r\nbody—which, in the language of the atom hypothesis, seeks to represent\r\nthe mode in which the atoms are grouped in the molecule, but which in\r\nreality represents only reactions, is written according as the chemist\r\nconsiders this or that group of reactions more important. These\r\nremarks might be illustrated by filling this page with the different\r\nformulæ (a score or more) which have been proposed as representing the\r\nconstitution (_reactions?_) of one of the best-known of organic\r\ncompounds, namely, acetic acid.\r\n\r\nWhether atoms really exist, and their arrangement in the particles of\r\nbodies can be deduced from the phenomena, or not, the fact is undeniable\r\nthat these ideas have given chemists a wonderful grasp of the facts of\r\ntheir science. The consistency and completeness of the explanation\r\nafforded by these theories are ever being extended by modifications\r\nwhich enable them to embrace more and more facts. Some of the properties\r\nof the substance we are now considering confirm in a remarkable manner\r\nthe theoretical views which are expressed in its constitutional formula.\r\nWe may first consider the nature of gunpowder, and by comparing it with\r\nnitro-glycerine, endeavour to explain the greater power of the latter\r\nsubstance. Gunpowder is a mixture of charcoal, sulphur, and nitre, the\r\nlatter constituting three-fourths of its weight. Nitre supplies oxygen\r\nfor the combustion of the charcoal, which is thus converted into\r\ncarbonic acid, and the sulphur, which is added to increase the rapidity\r\nof the combustion, is also oxidized. The products of the action are,\r\nhowever, numerous and complicated, but the important result is the\r\nsudden generation of a quantity of carbonic acid, nitrogen, carbonic\r\noxide, hydrogen, and other gases, which at the oxidizing temperature and\r\npressure of the air would occupy a space 300 times greater than the\r\npowder from which they are set free; but the intense heat attending the\r\nchemical action dilates the gases, so that at the moment of explosion\r\nthey would occupy a space at least 1,500 times greater than the\r\ngunpowder. The materials of which gunpowder is composed are finely\r\npowdered, in order that each portion shall be in immediate contact with\r\nothers, which shall act upon it. Plainly, the more thorough the\r\nincorporation of the materials—that is, the more finely ground and\r\nintimately mixed they are—the more rapid will be the inflammation of the\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nLooking now at the crude formula of nitro-glycerine,\r\nC_{3}H_{5}N_{3}O_{9}, the reader will remark that the molecule contains\r\nmore than sufficient oxygen to form carbonic acid with all the carbon\r\natoms, and water with all the hydrogen atoms; for the C_{6} in _two_\r\nmolecules of nitro-glycerine would take only O_{12} to form 6CO_{2}; and\r\nthe H_{10}, to be converted into 5H_{2}O, would only need O_{5}; thus\r\nthere would be an excess of oxygen. Now, it may occur to the reflective\r\nreader that in every molecule of nitro-glycerine the carbon and hydrogen\r\nare already associated with as much oxygen as they can take up: that\r\nthey are, in fact, already burnt, and that no further union is possible.\r\nBut from chemical considerations it has been deduced that in the\r\nnitro-glycerine molecule the oxygen atoms, except only three, which are\r\npartially and _imperfectly_ joined to carbon, are united to nitrogen\r\natoms only. The constitution of the molecule may be represented by\r\narranging, as below, the letters which stand for the atoms, and by\r\njoining them with lines, which shall stand for the bonds by which the\r\natoms are united.\r\n\r\n                             O   H H H   O\r\n                             |   | | |   |\r\n                             N—O—C—C—C—O—N\r\n                             |   | | |   |\r\n                             O   H O H   O\r\n                                   |\r\n                                 O=N=O\r\n\r\nWe see here that the hydrogen atoms are completely, and the carbon atoms\r\npartially, detached from the oxygen atoms; and therefore these atoms are\r\nin the condition of the separated carbon and oxygen atoms in gunpowder.\r\nOnly the pieces of matter which lie side by side in gunpowder are in\r\nsize to the molecules of nitro-glycerine as mountains to grains of sand.\r\nThe mixture of the materials is then so much more intimate in\r\nnitro-glycerine, since atoms which can rush together are actually within\r\nthe limits of the molecules; and these molecules have such a degree of\r\nminuteness, that 25 millions, at least, could be placed in a row within\r\nthe length of an inch. We know that the finer the grains and the more\r\nintimate the mixture, the quicker will gunpowder inflame; but here we\r\nhave a mixture far surpassing in minute subdivision anything we can\r\nimagine as existing in gunpowder. Hence the combination in the case of\r\nnitro-glycerine must be instantaneous, whereas that in gunpowder, quick\r\nthough it be, must still require a certain interval. If it take a\r\nthousandth of a second for the gases to be completely liberated from a\r\nmass of gunpowder, and only one-millionth of a second for a vast\r\nquantity of carbonic acid, nitrogen, and steam to be set free from\r\nnitro-glycerine, the destructive effect will be much greater in the\r\nlatter case. Again, the volume of the gases liberated from\r\nnitro-glycerine in its detonation have at least 5,000 times the bulk of\r\nthe substance. We have entered into these chemical considerations, at\r\nsome risk of wearying the reader, with the desire of affording him a\r\nclue to the singular properties of nitro-glycerine and gun-cotton, which\r\nwe are about to describe.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the chemical changes which may be set up in an explosive\r\nsubstance, and the rapidity with which these changes proceed throughout\r\na mass of the material, are greatly modified by the conditions under\r\nwhich the action takes place. If a red-hot wire be applied to a small\r\nloose tuft of gun-cotton, it goes off with a bright flash without\r\nleaving any smoke or any other residue. Thus, when the substance is\r\nquite unconfined, no explosion occurs. If the cotton-wool be made into a\r\nthread, and laid along the ground, it will burn at the rate of about 6\r\nin. per second; if it be twisted into a yarn, the combustion will run\r\nalong at the rate of 6 ft. per second; but if the yarn be enclosed in an\r\nIndian-rubber tube, the ignition proceeds at the rate of 30 ft. in a\r\nsecond. If to a limited surface of gun-cotton, such as one end of a\r\nlength of gun-cotton yarn, a source of heat is applied—the temperature\r\nof which is high enough to set up a chemical change, but not high enough\r\nto inflame the resulting gases (carbonic oxide, hydrogen, &c.)—the\r\ncotton burns comparatively slowly, rather smouldering than inflaming.\r\nIf, however, a _flame_ be applied, the gun-cotton flashes off with great\r\nrapidity, because the heat applied sets fire to the gaseous products of\r\nthe chemical action. But if the gun-cotton be confined so that the gases\r\ncannot escape, the combustion becomes rapid however set up. The reason\r\nis that if the gases escape into the air, they carry off so much of the\r\nheat produced by the smouldering gun-cotton, that the temperature does\r\nnot rise to the extent required to produce the flaming ignition, in\r\nwhich the products are completely oxidized. If a mass of gun-cotton be\r\nenclosed in a capacious vessel from which the air has been removed, and\r\nthe gun-cotton be ignited by means of a wire made hot by electricity,\r\nthe cotton will at first only burn in the slow way without flame; but as\r\nthe gases accumulate and exert a pressure which retards the abstraction\r\nof heat accompanying their formation, the temperature will rise and\r\nattain the degree necessary for the complete and rapid chemical changes\r\ninvolved in the flaming combustion. Thus, the more resistance is offered\r\nto the escape of the gases, the more rapid and perfect is the combustion\r\nand explosive force produced by the ignition. Now, the explosion of\r\ngun-cotton has been found to be too rapid when it is packed into the\r\npowder-chamber of a gun, for its tendency is to burst the gun before the\r\nball has been fairly started. Hence a material like gunpowder, in which\r\nthe combustion is more gradual, is better suited for artillery. The\r\nignition of gunpowder, though rapid, is not instantaneous, and therefore\r\nwe can speak of it as more or less gradual. Indeed, in even the most\r\nviolent explosives, some time is doubtless required for the propagation\r\nof the action from particle to particle. This extreme rapidity of\r\ncombustion, and consequent rending power, which is so objectionable in a\r\ngun-chamber, makes gun-cotton a most powerful bursting charge for\r\nshells, and, when it is enclosed in strong receptacles, for torpedoes\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nBut by the researches of Nobel, Professor Abel, and others, it has been\r\ndiscovered—and this is, perhaps, the most remarkable discovery in\r\nconnection with explosives—that gun-cotton, nitro-glycerine, and other\r\nexplosive bodies, are capable of producing explosions in a manner quite\r\ndifferent from that which attends their ignition by heat. The violence\r\nof this kind of explosion is far greater than that due to ordinary\r\nignition, for the action takes place with far greater rapidity\r\nthroughout the mass, and is, indeed, practically instantaneous. It\r\nappears to be produced by the mere mechanical agitation or vibrations\r\nwhich are communicated to the particles of the substance. Turning back\r\nto the representation of the molecule of nitro-glycerine on page 744, it\r\nwill not be difficult to imagine that this may be an unstable kind of\r\nstructure; that the atoms of oxygen are prevented from rushing into\r\nunion with those of hydrogen and carbon only by the interposition of the\r\nnitrogen; and that an agitation of the structure might shake all the\r\natoms loose, and leave them free to re-combine according to their\r\nstrongest affinities. Nitro-glycerine is by no means so ready to\r\n_inflame_ as is gun-cotton: it is said that the flame of a match may be\r\nsafely extinguished by plunging it into the liquid; and when a\r\nsufficient heat is applied to a quantity of the liquid in the open air,\r\nit will burn quietly and without explosion. Even when nitro-glycerine is\r\nconfined, the application of heat cannot always be made to produce its\r\nexplosion; or, at least, the circumstances under which it can do so are\r\nnot accurately known, and the operation is difficult and uncertain. On\r\nthe other hand, nitro-glycerine explodes violently even when freely\r\nexposed to the air if there be exploded in contact with it a _confined_\r\ncharge of gunpowder, or a detonating compound such as fulminating\r\npowder. Gun-cotton possesses the same property of exploding by\r\nconcussion, which appears indeed to be a general one belonging to all\r\nexplosive bodies. According to recent researches, even gunpowder is\r\ncapable of a detonative explosion. A mass of gunpowder confined with a\r\ncertain proportion of gun-cotton, which is itself set off by fulminate\r\nof mercury, is said to exert an explosive force four times greater than\r\nthat developed by the ignition of the gunpowder in the ordinary manner.\r\nIt has also been found that _wet_ gun-cotton can be exploded by\r\nconcussion, and the force of the explosion is unimpaired even when the\r\nmaterial is saturated with water. This makes it possible to use\r\ngun-cotton with greater safety, as it may be transported and handled in\r\nthe wet condition without risk, and it preserves its properties for an\r\nindefinite period without being deteriorated by the water. Some\r\nexperiments illustrating the extraordinary force of the detonative\r\nexplosions of gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine will give the reader an\r\nidea of their power.\r\n\r\nA palisade, constructed by sinking 4 ft. into the ground trunks of trees\r\n18 in. in diameter, was completely destroyed in some experiments at\r\nStowmarket by the explosion of only 15 lbs. of gun-cotton. Huge logs\r\nwere sent bounding across the field to great distances, and some of the\r\ntrees were literally reduced to match-wood. The gun-cotton, be it\r\nobserved, was simply laid on the ground exposed to the air. The\r\ndestructive powers of nitro-glycerine are even greater. A tin canister,\r\ncontaining only a few ounces of nitro-glycerine, is placed, without\r\nbeing in any way confined, on the top of a smooth boulder stone of\r\nseveral tons weight; it is exploded by a fuse containing fulminating\r\npowder, which is fired from a distance by electricity. There is a\r\nreport, and the stone is found in a thousand fragments. The last\r\nexperiment shows one of the advantages of nitro-glycerine over gunpowder\r\nas a blasting material, beyond its far greater power, which is about ten\r\ntimes that of gunpowder. A charge of gunpowder inserted in a vertical\r\nhole tends to force out a conical mass, the apex of which is at the\r\nspace occupied by the charge. With nitro-glycerine, and also with\r\ngun-cotton, which last has almost six times the force of gunpowder, a\r\npowerful rending action is exerted _below_ as well as above the charge.\r\nAgain, in blasting with gunpowder the charge must be confined, and the\r\nhole is filled in above the charge with tightly rammed materials,\r\nforming what is termed the _tamping_. But nitro-glycerine requires no\r\ntamping: a small, thin metallic core containing the charge is simply\r\nplaced in the drill-hole, or the liquid itself is poured in, and a\r\nlittle water placed above it. The effect of the explosion of\r\nnitro-glycerine in “striking down,” when apparently no resistance is\r\noffered, will seem very strange to the reader who is oblivious of\r\ncertain fundamental principles of mechanics. The force of the explosion\r\nis due entirely to the sudden production of an enormous volume of gas,\r\nwhich at the ordinary pressure would occupy several thousand times the\r\nbulk of the material from which it is produced. This gas, by the law of\r\nthe equality of action and reaction, presses down upon the stone with\r\nthe same force that it exerts to raise the superincumbent atmosphere.\r\nThe pressure of the gas at the moment of its liberation is enormous; but\r\nthe atmosphere cannot instantaneously yield to this, for time is\r\nrequired to set the mass of air in motion, and the wave of compression\r\nadvances slowly compared with the rapidity of the explosion. Hence the\r\nair acts, practically, like a mass of solid matter, against which the\r\ngases press, and which yields less readily than the rock, so that the\r\nblow which is struck takes visible effect on the latter. Now, with\r\ngunpowder, the evolution of gas is less rapid, the atmosphere has time\r\nto yield, and the reaction has not the same violence. The rapidity of\r\nthe evolution of gas from the exploding nitro-glycerine is so great,\r\nthat the gases, though apparently unconfined, are not so in reality; for\r\nthe atmosphere acts as a real and very efficient tamping.\r\n\r\nWhen nitro-glycerine first came into use for blasting purposes, it was\r\nused in the liquid form under the name of “blasting oil;” but the\r\ndangers attending the handling of the substance in this state are so\r\ngreat, that it is now usual to mix the liquid with some powdered\r\nsubstance which is itself without action, and merely serves as a vehicle\r\nfor containing the nitro-glycerine. To mixtures of this kind the names\r\n“_dynamite_,” “_dualine_,” “_lithofracteur_” &c., have been given.\r\n\r\nIt is now hardly necessary to point out that the discovery of these new\r\nexplosives has largely extended our power over the rocks, enabling works\r\nto be executed which would have been considered impracticable with less\r\npowerful agents. It is true that the most fearful disasters have been\r\naccidentally produced by the new explosives; but such occasional\r\ndevastation is the price exacted for the possession of powerful agents.\r\nAnd just as in other cases—steam, for example—where great forces are\r\ndealt with, so these new powers must be managed with unceasing care, and\r\nplaced in the hands of only skilful and intelligent men.\r\n\r\nThe products of the combustion of gunpowder are not all gaseous, but\r\ninclude solid compounds, such as carbonate and sulphate of potassium. It\r\nis these that give rise to the smoke seen when a gun is discharged, and\r\nwhich, in rapid firing, soon obscures the sight of the objects aimed at.\r\nThey are also the causes of the fouling of the bore. Gun-cotton is quite\r\nunexceptionable in these respects, and that prompted the attempts made\r\nsoon after its introduction to use it instead of gunpowder in fire-arms.\r\nBut the explosion of gun-cotton was found too sudden and violent for\r\nguns and rifles, so that many serious accidents in consequence occurred.\r\nThe next thing done was to lessen the rapidity of the explosion by using\r\ngun-cotton mixed with ordinary cotton, or twisted in threads round some\r\ninert substance—in fact, to mitigate the violence of the shock by some\r\nmechanical disposition of the material. The introduction of rapid firing\r\nguns and repeating rifles forced on the problem of a smokeless powder;\r\nand as the plan of replacing nitrate of potassium, in ordinary\r\ngunpowder, by nitrate of ammonium was found to be attended with loss of\r\nthe keeping quality of the powder, other materials, such as picric acid,\r\nwhich forms also the basis of the explosive called _mélinite_, have been\r\nproposed. The composition of _mélinite_ was long a mystery, and that of\r\nthe smokeless powder adopted by the French was so carefully concealed\r\nthat many experiments had to be made by other nations to discover some\r\nsimilar preparation, which was found possible by combining certain\r\nsubstances with gun-cotton so as to modify the violence of its\r\nexplosion, and produce a manageable material having the required\r\nproperties. The British Government, after many experiments and much\r\ncareful testing, decided to adopt _cordite_, made of nitro-glycerine, in\r\nwhich, by the aid of volatile solvent, di-nitro-cellulose is dissolved,\r\ntogether with a little mineral oil. The semi-fluid composition, forced\r\nthrough a round hole or die, comes out like a thread or cord, which the\r\nevaporation of the volatile solvent leaves with very much the appearance\r\nof common brown window-cord. This material has the several advantages of\r\nkeeping well, of being _uniform_ in its propulsive powers, of being\r\ncapable of imparting as high a velocity as a much larger charge of the\r\nordinary black gunpowder, while at the same time exercising a less\r\npressure on the chase of the gun.\r\n\r\nIt will have become obvious from the preceding paragraphs that,\r\naccording to the conditions under which an explosive is to be used,\r\nselection must be made of the most suitable. For example, the substances\r\nemployed for propelling projectiles from guns must not have the violent\r\nrending power of certain others, which, by this very property, are most\r\nuseful for blasting operations; and, again, although explosives of this\r\nlast kind are inadmissible as projectile agents, they are of the kind\r\nbest adapted for use in shells where it is the disruptive action that is\r\nrequired. Also in blasting operations, the explosive has to be adapted\r\nto the nature of the work, and it has been found that a substance which\r\nhas worked well in driving a heading for a tunnel through one kind of\r\nrock may prove both slow in progress, and more costly in expenditure,\r\nwhen some different kind of rock is reached. Besides this, regard must\r\nbe had in blasting operations to the nature of the effect required,\r\nwhich is in some instances a shattering of the rock into fragments, in\r\nothers a detachment of it in masses. Thus, in the working of a slate\r\nquarry, the explosive used must not be of a nature to shiver the rock\r\ninto useless splinters, but must operate in such a manner that compact\r\nmasses may be separated from the mountain side in a condition suitable\r\nfor cleaving, by appropriate tools, into numberless broad laminæ, which,\r\ntrimmed into rectangular shape, constitute our well-known roofing\r\nslates. The blasting used on a coal seam must be so conducted as to\r\nyield the material as much as possible in big lumps or cobbles rather\r\nthan in slack. When granite is blasted for the purpose of obtaining\r\nbuilding stones, the explosive must be one that, by its comparatively\r\nslow action, divides the compact rock into the largest possible blocks.\r\nOn the other hand, when granite is blasted merely with the object of\r\nremoving it, as when a tunnel has to be driven through a mass of it, the\r\nmost disintegrating agent is then the best. The common popular\r\nexpressions by which the two classes of explosives just referred to are\r\ndistinguished are “high explosives” and “low explosives.” Dynamite may\r\nbe taken as a type of the former, and gunpowder a type of the latter. As\r\nwill be gathered from what is to follow, no definite separation between\r\nthese classes can be fixed, but in a general way it may be said that,\r\nwhere a destructive, rather than a propelling or pressure effect is\r\nrequired, the explosive used is one brought into operation by a\r\nconcussive or detonating priming, and acting mostly by detonation within\r\nitself, such as dynamite, &c.\r\n\r\nWhereas, up to nearly the middle of the nineteenth century, gunpowder\r\nwas practically the only explosive in use for either civil or military\r\npurposes, the close of the century can show a list of several hundred\r\npreparations that have been proposed or actually used in its stead. The\r\nnames by which these are put forward are expressive sometimes of an\r\ningredient in their composition, such as “ammonia dynamite,”\r\n“cellulosa,” “mica powder,” “dynamite au carbon,” “dynamite de boghead,”\r\n&c.; and sometimes the inventor’s name, as “So-and-so’s powder or\r\nexplosive”; sometimes of the strength of the mixture under various\r\nfanciful names, such as “dynamite,” “heraklin,” “vigorite,” &c., &c.;\r\nsometimes the names relate to the appearance of the compound, as “white\r\ngunpowder,” “blasting gelatine,” &c., &c.; and sometimes to other\r\ncircumstances, such as “pudrolithe,” “saxifragine,” “safety powder,”\r\n&c., &c. A very long list might be given of the substances severally\r\nused in these various compositions. It will be sufficient to indicate\r\nthe general nature of the several classes into which the new explosives\r\nmay be divided. By turning back to p. 746, the reader will be reminded\r\nof the composition of gunpowder, and of the part played therein by the\r\nnitre (nitrate of potassium). Now a considerable number of the recently\r\npatented explosives are simply modified gunpowders, which all contain\r\nsome nitrate, replacing wholly, or in part, the nitrate of potassium,\r\nwhile sulphur is an ingredient of nearly all, and in many, the charcoal\r\nof gunpowder is partly or wholly replaced by other carbonaceous\r\nmaterials, such as sawdust, coal-dust, tan, starch, paraffin,\r\nlycopodium, graphite, peat, flour, bran, &c. Certain mineral salts enter\r\ninto the composition of some, such as sulphate of iron, carbonate of\r\ncopper, sulphide of antimony, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nIn another class of the newer explosives chlorate of potassium takes the\r\nplace of the nitrate as the oxygen supplying material, with similar\r\nvariations as to the carbonaceous matter as are referred to above.\r\nYellow prussiate of potash and sugar sometimes replace both the charcoal\r\nand sulphur of gunpowder in this class. Explosives of this chlorate\r\nclass are usually dangerous to manufacture, and are often very\r\nsensitive, and also liable to changes by keeping, which render them\r\nstill more dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe next class of preparations brings us to the “high explosives,”\r\nproperly so called, and it is among these that most notable preparations\r\nare met with. Of all the explosive nitro-compounds, gun-cotton was the\r\nfirst practically employed (_vide_ p. 741); but very soon after\r\nnitro-glycerine was discovered by Sobrero when working in Pelouze’s\r\nlaboratory. This afterwards became known as “blasting oil,” but it was\r\nmany years before nitro-glycerine came into use as an explosive, namely,\r\nwhen, about 1860, Nobel, a Swedish engineer, had established factories\r\nfor its production as an agent for blasting. At first there were\r\ndifficulties and dangers attending its use, and it was only when Nobel\r\nhad discovered the detonation method of setting free its tremendous\r\nenergy that the new era of “high explosives” really commenced. Between\r\n1860 and 1870 such a number of appalling catastrophes occurred in the\r\nhandling of the new “blasting oil” that in several European countries\r\nits use was entirely prohibited. And, in England at least, this\r\nprohibition remains, for “in a liquid state this explosive cannot be\r\nsold in, or imported into this country. It is manufactured under the\r\nstrict provision that it is forthwith made up into dynamite or some\r\nkindred licensed explosive.” ... “The only source, practically speaking,\r\nof nitro-glycerine on a commercial scale in this country is the factory\r\nof Nobel’s Explosive Co. (Ltd.) at Ardeer, in the county of Ayr.”[17]\r\nNitro-glycerine being so extremely dangerous to handle in the liquid\r\nform led Nobel to propose its use in an altered condition, by causing it\r\nto be absorbed by some inert porous material, the most suitable being a\r\nsiliceous earth found in Germany, and there known as _kieselguhr_, of\r\nwhich one part will absorb three times its weight of liquid\r\nnitro-glycerine. Here we have the original dynamite, but now other\r\nsubstances are used for absorbing the liquid, and there are, indeed,\r\ndynamites of two different classes:\r\n\r\n1. Dynamites with inert absorbents.\r\n\r\n2. Dynamites with absorbents which are themselves combustible, or\r\nexplosive.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Major Cundill, H.M.’s Inspector of Explosives.\r\n\r\nOf the latter class there are endless varieties. One that has latterly\r\nbeen much used is called “blasting gelatine,” and is practically a\r\ncombination of nitro-glycerine and nitro-cotton, this last ingredient\r\nbeing a less nitrated cellulose than gun-cotton. Blasting gelatine\r\ncontains a very large percentage of nitro-glycerine (93–95 per cent.),\r\nand has the appearance of stiff jelly of a pale yellow colour. It may be\r\nof interest to remark that this second class of dynamites admits of\r\nwell-defined sub-divisions according to the nature of the absorbent, as:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Charcoal, or other simple carbonaceous material.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Gunpowder, or other nitrate or chlorate mixtures.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Gun-cotton, or other nitro-compounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 340.—_View on the Tyne._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MINERAL COMBUSTIBLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain mineral combustibles may fairly claim attention in a work\r\ntreating of the discoveries of the nineteenth century, not because these\r\nbodies have been known and used only in recent times, but for other\r\nreasons. The true nature of coal—that most important of all\r\ncombustibles—its relation to the past history of the earth, and to the\r\npresent and future interests of mankind; the work it will do; the extent\r\nof the supply still existing in the bowels of the earth; the innumerable\r\nchemical products which it yields—are subjects on which the knowledge\r\ngained during the present century forms a body of discovery of the most\r\ninteresting and important kind. Another substance we have to mention,\r\nthough not a modern discovery, has lately been found in far greater\r\nabundance, and is now so largely used for various purposes, that it has\r\nbecome an important article of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _COAL._\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 341.—_Fossil Trees in a Railway Cutting._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMost persons know, or at least have been told, that coal is fossil\r\nvegetable matter,—the long-buried remains of ancient forests. But\r\nprobably many receive the statement, not perhaps with incredulity, but\r\nwith a certain vague notion that it is, after all, merely a daring\r\nsurmise. And, indeed, nothing is at first sight more unlike stems, or\r\nleaves, or roots of plants than a lump of coal. Then everybody knows\r\nthat coal is found thousands of feet beneath the surface of the earth,\r\nwhereas plants can grow only in the light of the sun. One begins to\r\nunderstand the matter only when the teachings of geology have shown him\r\nthat, so far from the crust of the earth being, as he is apt to suppose,\r\nfixed and unchangeable, it is in a state of constant fluctuation.\r\nChanges in the levels of the ground are always going on: in one place it\r\nis rising, in another sinking; here a tract of land is emerging from the\r\nocean, there a continent is subsiding beneath the water. The extreme\r\nslowness with which these changes proceed causes them to escape all\r\nordinary observation. The case may be compared to the hour-hand on the\r\ndial, which a casual spectator might pronounce quite stationary, since\r\nthe observation of a few seconds fails to detect its movement. As the\r\nwhole period comprehended in human annals counts but as a second of\r\ngeological time, it cannot be wondered at that it required a vast\r\naccumulation of facts, and much careful and patient deduction from them,\r\nbefore a conclusion was reached so apparently contradictory of\r\nexperience. It is, indeed, startling to learn that “the sure and\r\nfirm-set earth” is in a state of flow and change. Even the “everlasting\r\nhills” give evidence that their materials were collected at the bottom\r\nof the sea, and we know that the water which runs down their sides is\r\nslowly but surely carrying them back particle by particle. Of the\r\nmagnitude of the changes which the surface of the earth has undergone in\r\ntimes past, and which are still imperceptibly but constantly proceeding,\r\nthe ordinary experience of mankind can of itself give no example. But\r\nsuch changes have sufficed to entomb a vast quantity of relics of the\r\ninnumerable forms of vegetation which flourished and waved their\r\nbranches in the sun, ages upon ages before the advent of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 342.—_Impression of Leaf found in Coal Measures (Pecopteris)._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt may be thought impossible that vegetable matter should have so\r\nchanged as to become a dense, black, glistening, brittle mass, showing\r\nno obvious forms of leaves or texture of wood. But no one who has seen\r\nhow a quantity of damp hay closely pressed together will, after a time,\r\nbecome heated and change in colour to black, can have any difficulty in\r\ncomprehending how chemical and mechanical actions may completely alter\r\nthe aspect of vegetable matter. We have, however, the most direct\r\nevidence of the vegetable origin of coal in the numberless\r\nunquestionable forms of trees and plants met with in all coal strata.\r\nSometimes the trunks of the trees fossilized into stony matter are found\r\nupright in the very situation in which they grew. Thus in Fig. 341 is\r\nrepresented the appearance exhibited by the trunks and roots of some\r\nfossil trees, which were exposed to view in the formation of a railway\r\ncutting between Manchester and Bolton. In every coal-field also\r\nbeautiful impressions of the stems and leaves of plants are met with—one\r\ncommon form of which is shown in Fig. 342. Most of the plants so found\r\nbelong to the flowerless division of the vegetable kingdom. Some are\r\nclosely allied to the ferns of the present day—to the common\r\n“mare’s-tail” (_Equisetum_), to the club-moss, and to other well-known\r\nplants. The firs and pines of the coal age are scarcely distinguishable\r\nfrom existing species. If a fragment of ordinary coal be ground to a\r\nvery thin slice—so thin as to be transparent—and placed under the\r\nmicroscope, it will show a number of minute rounded bodies, which are,\r\nthere is good reason to believe, nothing else than the spores or seeds\r\nof plants, closely resembling the existing club-mosses. The spores of\r\nthe club-moss (_Lycopodium_) are so full of resinous matter, that they\r\nare used for making fireworks and the flashes of lightning at theatres.\r\nIt is, therefore, extremely probable that the bitumen of coal is due to\r\nthe resin of similar spores, altered by the effects of subterranean\r\nheat. The immense abundance of these little spores in the coal is a\r\nproof that they accumulated in the ancient forests as the mosses grew,\r\nand therefore the matter of coal was not accumulated under water or\r\nwashed down into the sea; for these little spores are extremely light,\r\nand they cannot be wetted by water, and therefore they would have\r\nfloated on the surface, and would not have been found so diffused\r\nthroughout the coal. Fig. 343 is a picture of the possible aspect of the\r\nancient forests of the coal age. In the humid atmosphere which probably\r\nprevailed at that period, the large tree-ferns and gigantic club-mosses,\r\nwhich are conspicuous in the picture, must have flourished luxuriantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 343.—_Possible Aspect of the Forests of the Coal Age._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe immense importance of coal for domestic purposes will be obvious\r\nfrom the fact that it is estimated that in the United Kingdom alone no\r\nless than 30,000,000 tons are annually consumed in house fires. Another\r\ngreat use of coal is in the smelting, puddling, and working of iron, and\r\nthis probably consumes as much as our domestic fireplaces. Then there is\r\nthe vast consumption by steam engines, by locomotives, and by\r\nsteamboats. Another purpose for which coal is largely used is the making\r\nof illuminating gas; and to the foregoing must also be added the\r\nquantity which goes to feed the furnaces necessary in so many of the\r\narts—such as in the manufacturing of glass, porcelain, salt, chemicals,\r\n&c. The quantity of coal raised in Great Britain was not accurately\r\nknown until 1854, when it was ordered that a register should be kept,\r\nand an annual return made. The following figures, in round numbers, are\r\nthe returns published up to 1873. The table is continued in Note A.\r\n\r\n                      Year.

The\r\namount did not greatly vary until 1859, when there was an increased\r\nproduction of nearly seven millions of tons; in 1860 a further increase\r\nof eleven millions of tons more. Since then the quantity annually raised\r\nhas been increasing. Comparing the quantity which has been raised in any\r\nyear after 1863 with that raised ten years before, we see that the\r\nincrease in ten years is nearly half as much again; or, that at the\r\npresent rate of increase the amount annually raised doubles itself at\r\nleast every twenty years. Now, the question arises, How long can this go\r\non? However great may be the store of coal, it must sooner or later come\r\nto an end. Is it possible to calculate how long our coals will last? and\r\nwhat are the results of such calculations? These calculations have been\r\nmade; but there are great discrepancies in the results, for the\r\nestimates of the amount of available coal still remaining vary greatly,\r\nand different views are held regarding the rate of consumption in the\r\nfuture. A very liberal estimate, by an excellent authority, of the\r\nquantity of coal remaining under British soil, makes it 147,000 millions\r\nof tons. With a consumption stationary at the present rate, this will\r\nlast 1,200 years; with an increase of consumption of 3,000,000 tons a\r\nyear, 276 years; but if the consumption continues to increase in the\r\nsame geometrical ratio it has hitherto followed, the supply will\r\nscarcely last 100 years. It cannot be conceived, however, that this last\r\nwill be the real case, for the increasing depth to which it will be\r\nnecessary to go will soon cause a great increase in the cost, and thus\r\neffectually check the consumption. Great Britain will, however, be\r\ncompelled to retire from the coal trade altogether, by the cheaper\r\nsupplies which other countries will yield, long before the absolute\r\nexhaustion of her own coal-fields. It is calculated that the coal-fields\r\nof North America contain thirteen times as much as those of all Europe\r\nput together. Coal is also found abundantly in India, China, Borneo,\r\nEastern Australia, and South Africa; and it is believed that these\r\nstores will supply the world for many thousand years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 344.—_The Fireside._\r\n]\r\n\r\nSeeing, then, that our supply of coal has a limit, and that at the\r\npresent increasing rate of consumption, the chief source of the wealth\r\nof Great Britain must necessarily be exhausted in a few more centuries,\r\nit behoves us to turn our mineral treasures to the best account, and to\r\nadopt every possible means of obtaining from our coal its whole\r\navailable heat and force. The amount of avoidable waste of which we are\r\nguilty in the consumption of coal is enormous. This is especially the\r\ncase in its domestic use, where probably nineteen-twentieths of the heat\r\nproduced is absolutely thrown away—sent off from the earth to warm the\r\nstars. In England people look upon the wide open fireplace as the image\r\nand type of home comfort. No doubt there are, from long use and habit,\r\nmany pleasing associations which cluster round the domestic hearth; but\r\nwe, to whom it is given to “look before and after,” must think what it\r\ntakes to feed that wide-throated chimney. All but a very small fraction\r\nof the heat thus escapes, and is lost to man and the world for ever; and\r\nsurely we shall deserve the curses of our descendants if we continue\r\nrecklessly to throw away a treasure which, unlike the oil in the widow’s\r\ncruse, is never renewed—for there is no contemporaneous formation of\r\ncoal. Thanks to the enhanced price of coal during the last few years,\r\nsome attention has been directed to contrivances for the economical\r\nconsumption of coal in its domestic, as well as in its manufacturing,\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nA time, however, will sooner or later come, when the whole available\r\ncoal shall have been consumed. What will then be the fuel of the\r\nengines, and steamboats, and locomotives of the future? The reader may\r\nthink that then it will only be necessary to burn wood. But wood is\r\nalready being consumed from the face of the earth much more rapidly than\r\nit is produced. How, then, can it be available when coal fails? The\r\ntruth is, we are now consuming not merely the wood which the sun-rays\r\nare building up in our own time, but in hewing down the forests we are\r\nusing the sun-work of a century, while in coal we have the forests of\r\nuntold ages at our disposal—the accumulated combustible capital stored\r\nup during an immense period of the earth’s existence. Upon this\r\nstored-up capital we are now living, our current receipts of sun-force\r\nbeing wholly inadequate to meet our expenditure. The coal is the\r\nsun-force of former ages; and it is from this we are now deriving the\r\nenergy which performs most of our work. George Stephenson long ago\r\ndeclared that his locomotives were driven by sunshine—by the sunshine of\r\nformer ages bottled up in the coal. And he was right. The mechanical\r\nenergy of our steam engines, and the chemical energy of our blast\r\nfurnaces, are derived from the combustion of vegetable matter, in which\r\nthe heat and light of the sun—our present sun or that of the coal\r\nages—are in some way stored up. The burning of wood or coal is,\r\nchemically, the reverse action to that performed by the sunlight: by the\r\nformer carbon and oxygen are united, by the latter they are separated.\r\n\r\nWe foresee, then, a future period—however distant may be that future—in\r\nwhich the world’s capital shall have been exhausted, and the energies\r\nwhich are now employed in doing the world’s work will no longer be\r\navailable. But the reader will perhaps think that by improvements in the\r\nsteam engine, and in other ways, means will be found of getting more and\r\nmore work out of coal. It is true that we obtain from coal only a\r\n_fraction_ of its available energy; but the whole work which could, by\r\nany possible process, be done by the combustion of coal is _definite and\r\nlimited_, although its amount is large. A pound of coal burnt in one\r\nminute sets free an amount of energy which would, if it could all be\r\nmade available, do as much as 300 horses working in the same time. But,\r\nagain, the reader may think, even if at some distant future the supplies\r\nof fuel for the steam engines of our remote posterity should fail, that\r\nbefore that time some other form of force than steam or heat engines\r\nwill have been discovered—some application of electricity, for example.\r\nNow, it will appear, from principles which will be discussed in a\r\nsubsequent article, that not only is there no probability of such a\r\ndiscovery, but that now, when the relations of the whole available\r\nenergies of the globe have been traced and defined, Science can find no\r\nground for admitting such a possibility under the present condition of\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _PETROLEUM._\r\n\r\nWhen coal is heated in closed vessels, there are given off, as we shall\r\npresently see, a number of gaseous and volatile products—many being\r\ncompounds of carbon and hydrogen—which condense to liquids or solids at\r\nordinary temperatures. Carbon is by far the largest constituent of coal,\r\nwhich commonly contains only about 10 per cent. of other substances,\r\nalthough the proportions vary very widely. Another important constituent\r\nof coal is its hydrogen, and the value of coal as a source of heat\r\ndepends almost entirely upon the carbon and hydrogen it contains. Carbon\r\nis one of the most remarkable of all the elements of the globe for its\r\npower of entering into an enormous number of compounds. Thus, for\r\nexample, the compounds of carbon with only hydrogen are innumerable; but\r\nthey are all definite, and their composition is expressible by the\r\nadmirable system of chemical symbols, of which the reader has now, it is\r\nhoped, some definite notion. Perhaps these hydro-carbons are among the\r\nbest evidences which could be adduced that modern science has obtained a\r\ngrasp of certain conceptions which have a real correspondence with the\r\nactual facts of nature, even as regards the intimate constitution of\r\nmatter. This is not the place to enter into a complete exposition of\r\nthis subject. We may, however, invite the reader’s attention to a few\r\nsimple facts. A very large number of compounds of carbon and hydrogen\r\nare known. If the percentage compositions of these be compared together,\r\nit is only the eye of a most expert arithmetician which can detect any\r\nrelation between the proportions of the constituents in the various\r\ncompounds. The chemist, however, by associating such of these compounds\r\nas resemble each other in their general properties, finds that they can\r\nbe arranged in series, in which the composition is accurately expressed\r\nby multiples of the proportions: C = 12, H = 1. And not only so, the\r\ndifferent series themselves form a series of series, having a simple\r\nrelation to each other. Thus, confining ourselves to some of the known\r\nhydro-carbons, we have the following:\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐\r\n │          A           │          B           │          C           │\r\n ├──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤\r\n │       C H_{4}        │       C H_{2}        │                      │\r\n │      C_{2}H_{6}      │      C_{2}H_{4}      │      C_{2}H_{2}      │\r\n │      C_{3}H_{8}      │      C_{3}H_{6}      │      C_{3}H_{4}      │\r\n │     C_{4}H_{10}      │      C_{4}H_{8}      │      C_{4}H_{6}      │\r\n │     C_{5}H_{12}      │     C_{5}H_{10}      │      C_{5}H_{8}      │\r\n │     C_{6}H_{14}      │     C_{6}H_{12}      │     C_{6}H_{10}      │\r\n │         &c.          │         &c.          │         &c.          │\r\n │ C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ + 2}  │   C_{_n_}H_{2_n_}    │ C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ – 2}  │\r\n └──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐\r\n │          D           │          E           │          F           │\r\n ├──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤\r\n │                      │                      │                      │\r\n │                      │                      │                      │\r\n │      C_{3}H_{2}      │                      │                      │\r\n │      C_{4}H_{4}      │      C_{4}H_{2}      │                      │\r\n │      C_{5}H_{6}      │      C_{5}H_{4}      │      C_{5}H_{2}      │\r\n │      C_{6}H_{8}      │      C_{6}H_{6}      │      C_{6}H_{4}      │\r\n │         &c.          │         &c.          │         &c.          │\r\n │ C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ – 4}  │ C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ – 6}  │ C_{_n_}H_{2_n_ – 8}  │\r\n └──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThis table might be indefinitely extended, but enough is given to enable\r\nthe intelligent reader to discover the laws connecting these formulæ.\r\nThe series headed B, it will be observed, have all the same percentage\r\ncomposition. Why, then, one formula rather than another? The answer to\r\nthis question is the statement of a theoretical law upon which the whole\r\nscience of modern chemistry is based; for it has the same relation to\r\nthat science as gravitation has to astronomy. It is a matter of fact\r\nthat all gases, whatever their chemical nature, expand alike with the\r\nsame application of heat, and all obey the same law, which connects\r\nvolumes and pressures. These are very remarkable uniformities, for gases\r\nin this respect exhibit the most decided contrast to liquids and solids.\r\nThe volume of each solid and of each liquid has its own special\r\nrelations to temperature and pressure: here there is endless diversity.\r\nThe volumes of all gases have one and the same relation to temperature\r\nand pressure: here there is absolute uniformity. As an explanation of\r\nthese and other facts relating to gases, Amedeo Avogadro, in 1811, put\r\nforward this hypothesis—_Equal volumes of all gases, under like\r\ncircumstances of temperature and pressure, contain the same number of\r\nmolecules_. This hypothesis was revived by Ampère a few years later, and\r\nsometimes is called his. A necessary consequence of this law is that the\r\nweights of the molecules of gases are proportional to their densities or\r\nspecific gravities. Hence when the percentage composition of a\r\nhydro-carbon has been determined, by burning or oxidizing it in such a\r\nmanner as to obtain and weigh the products, carbonic acid and water, the\r\nnext thing the chemist does is to obtain the weight of a volume of the\r\ngas. The number of times this exceeds the weight of hydrogen gas, under\r\nthe same conditions, expresses how many times the molecule is heavier\r\nthan the hydrogen molecule. Now, the chemist’s unit of weight in these\r\ninquiries is the weight of a single _atom_ of hydrogen; and, as there\r\nare grounds for believing that the _molecule_ of hydrogen consists of\r\ntwo atoms of that substance, its weight = 2. Now, if the molecule of\r\nmarsh gas, the first hydro-carbon in the above list, has the composition\r\nassigned, it will be 12 + 4 = 16 times heavier than the _atom_ of\r\nhydrogen, and 16/2 = 8 times heavier than the _molecule_ of hydrogen.\r\nHence, if Avogadro’s law be correct, marsh gas should be just eight\r\ntimes heavier than hydrogen gas; which is really the fact. The formula\r\nexpressing the composition of the molecule of a hydro-carbon, or of any\r\nchemical compound whatever, is always so fixed that the same relations\r\nmay hold; and almost the first thing a chemist does in examining a new\r\nbody is to endeavour to obtain it in the state of gas.\r\n\r\nThe first four members of the series headed A are gases at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, the fifth is a gas at temperatures above the\r\nfreezing-point, and a liquid at lower temperatures; the next following\r\nmembers are liquids which boil (that is, are converted into gases) at\r\ntemperatures rising with each additional carbon atom about 20° F. The\r\nspecific gravities and boiling-points of these liquids augment as we\r\npass from one hydro-carbon to the next, and the lower members of the\r\nseries are solids, fusing at temperatures higher and higher as the\r\nnumber of carbon atoms is greater. Similar gradations of properties are\r\nexhibited by the other series of hydro-carbons. Petroleum or rock-oil is\r\nthe name given to liquid hydro-carbons found in nature, and consisting\r\nchiefly of compounds belonging to the series marked A in the above list.\r\nSome varieties of petroleum hold in solution other hydro-carbons, and in\r\nsome cases paraffin is extracted from the oils by exposing the liquid to\r\ncold, when the solid crystallizes out. Paraffin is a solid belonging to\r\nthe B series, and it is for the most part obtained by heating certain\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nDeposits of liquid hydro-carbons, perhaps formed by a kind of natural\r\nsubterranean distillation from coal or other fossil organic matter,\r\nexist in various localities. These deposits have long been known and\r\nutilized at Rangoon, in Burmah, and on the shores of the Caspian Sea. At\r\nRangoon the mineral oil is obtained by sinking wells about 60 ft. deep\r\nin a kind of clay soil, which is saturated with it. The oily clay rests\r\nupon a bed of slate also containing oil, and underneath this is coal. It\r\nmay be supposed that subterranean heat, acting upon the coal, has\r\ndistilled off the petroleum, which has condensed in the upper strata.\r\nThis petroleum, when distilled in a current of steam, leaves about 4 per\r\ncent of residue, and the volatile portion contains about one-tenth of\r\nits weight of a substance (paraffin) which is solid at ordinary\r\ntemperatures. After an agitation with oil of vitriol, and another\r\ndistillation, _rock oil_ or _naphtha_ is obtained, which, however, is\r\nstill a mixture of several distinct chemical compounds. Mineral oils\r\nhave also been found in China, Japan, Hindostan, Persia, the West India\r\nIslands, France, Italy, Bavaria, and England. In one of the Ionian\r\nIslands there are oil-springs which have flowed, it is said, over 2,000\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBut it is the recently discovered and extremely copious springs and\r\nwells in Pennsylvania and Canada which have given a vastly extended\r\nimportance to the trade in mineral oil. Rock oil is now used in enormous\r\nquantities as the cheapest illuminating oil, and that which furnishes\r\nthe most intense light. Its consumption as a lubricating oil for\r\nmachines has also been very large. Mineral oil was occasionally found at\r\nvarious places in the United States, and sometimes used by the\r\ninhabitants of the locality before the recent discoveries; but it was\r\nnot until August, 1859, that it was met with in large quantities. About\r\nthis time a boring which was made at Oil Creek, Pennsylvania, reached an\r\nabundant source, for 1,000 gallons a day were drawn from it for many\r\nweeks. The news of the discovery of this copious oil-spring spread\r\nrapidly: thousands of persons flocked to the neighbourhood in hopes of\r\neasily making a fortune by “striking oil.” Before the end of 1860 more\r\nthan a thousand wells had been bored, and some of these had yielded\r\nlargely. The regions of North America in which petroleum has been found\r\ncover a large part of the States, and comprise Pennsylvania, New York,\r\nOhio, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Illinois, Texas, and\r\nCalifornia. In the vicinity of Oil Creek the bore-holes are usually\r\nabout 3 in. or 4 in. in diameter, and are often 500 ft. deep, and even\r\n800 ft. is not uncommon. To make a bore-hole 900 ft. deep, and procure\r\nall the requisites—steam engines, barrels, &c., for pumping the\r\noil—costs about $5,000. In 1869 many of these wells still yielded\r\nregularly 300 barrels a day, but the supply has not continued with the\r\nsame abundance. One of the luckiest wells flowed at its first opening at\r\nthe rate of about 25,000 barrels a day. The apparatus used for working\r\nthe oil-wells is very simple—a rude derrick, a small steam engine, a\r\npump, and some barrels and tubs being all that is necessary. Fig. 345\r\nwill give the reader an idea of the scene presented by a cluster of\r\noil-wells in the Oil Creek region. Oil Creek received its name before\r\nthe petroleum trade was established, from the oil found floating on the\r\nsurface of the water. It is on the Alleghany River, about 150 miles\r\nabove Pittsburg, and here at its mouth is situated Oil City. There is a\r\nwharf in Pittsburg for the oil traffic, and the barrels are brought down\r\nthe river in flats, or the oil is poured into very large flat boxes,\r\ndivided into compartments, which are then closed, and the boxes floated\r\ndown in groups of twenty or more. The refining process consists in\r\nplacing the crude oil into a large iron retort, connected with a\r\ncondenser formed of a coil of iron pipes, surrounded by cold water. Heat\r\nis applied, and the lighter hydro-carbons (naphtha) come over first.\r\nAfter the naphtha, the oils which are used for illuminating purposes\r\ndistil off. A current of steam is then forced into the retort, and this\r\nbrings over the heavy oils which are used for greasing machinery. A\r\nblack tarry oil yet remains; and, finally, after the separation of this,\r\na quantity of coke. The products are subjected to certain processes of\r\npurification, which need not here be described. The magnitude of the\r\nAmerican oil trade may be inferred from the fact that in the second year\r\nof its existence, from January to June, 1862, more than 4,500,000\r\ngallons were exported from four seaports. This can hardly be wondered\r\nat, considering the extremely low price at which this excellent\r\nilluminating and lubricating agent can be produced. Refined petroleum\r\ncan be bought at Pittsburg for 16 cents. per gallon. It is believed by\r\nsome that the supplies of petroleum which exist in various localities\r\nare so abundant that they will furnish illuminating oils to the whole\r\nworld for centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 345.—_View on Hyde and Egbert’s Farm, Oil Creek._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _PARAFFIN._\r\n\r\nIn the course of some researches on the substances contained in the tar,\r\nwhich is obtained by heating wood in close vessels, Reichenbach found a\r\nwhite translucent substance, to which he gave the above name, because it\r\nwas not acted upon by any of the ordinary chemical reagents, such as\r\nsulphuric acid, nitric acid, &c. This substance, which is composed of\r\ncarbon and hydrogen only, is not unlike spermaceti; it is colourless,\r\ntranslucent, and without smell or taste. But when slightly warmed, it\r\nbecomes very plastic, and may then be moulded with the greatest ease—and\r\nin this respect it differs from spermaceti. Paraffin melts at from 88°\r\nto 150° C., to a colourless liquid, which is so fluid that it may be\r\nfiltered through paper like water, and at a higher temperature it can be\r\ndistilled unchanged. Paraffin does not dissolve in water, and is but\r\nslightly soluble in alcohol. In ether, naphtha, turpentine, benzol, and\r\nsulphide of carbon, it dissolves very readily. When heated with sulphur,\r\nit is decomposed: the sulphur seizes upon its hydrogen, sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen is given off, and the carbon is separated; and this action has\r\nbeen proposed as a ready means of obtaining pure sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nfor laboratory use. It is probable that paraffin is a mixture of various\r\nhydro-carbons, having a composition expressible by the formula,\r\nC_{_n_}H_{2_n_}; for different specimens fuse at different temperatures,\r\naccording as the paraffin has been obtained from one or the other\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1847, Dr. Lyon Playfair directed the attention of Mr. James\r\nYoung, then of Manchester, to a dense petroleum which issued from the\r\ncrevices of the coal in a Derbyshire mine. It was soon found that this\r\nsubstance yielded a distillation—a pale yellow oil—which, on cooling,\r\ndeposited solid paraffin. Mr. Young, recognizing the importance of this\r\ndiscovery, had an establishment at once erected on the spot, and the\r\nwork of extracting paraffin was carried on until the supply of the\r\npetroleum had become nearly exhausted. Forced to seek for other sources\r\nof paraffin, Mr. Young was fortunate enough, after many trials, to\r\ndiscover that a species of bituminous coal, which occurs at Boghead,\r\nnear Bathgate, in the county of Linlithgow, yielded by distillation\r\nannually large quantities of paraffin. In 1850 he procured a patent for\r\n“treating bituminous coals to obtain paraffin, and oil containing\r\nparaffin, therefrom.” This method consisted in distilling the coal in an\r\niron retort, gradually heated up to low redness, and kept at that\r\ntemperature until the volatile products ceased to come off. Under this\r\npatent, Mr. Young developed the manufacture of paraffin into a new and\r\nimportant branch of industry. The oil which first comes over in the\r\ndistillation of the Boghead mineral is largely used for illuminating\r\npurposes under a variety of names besides that of _paraffin oil_, which\r\nterm is, we believe, chiefly applied to a less volatile portion,\r\nextensively used for lubricating machinery, and consisting of liquid\r\nhydro-carbons of the same percentage composition as solid paraffin,\r\nwhich substance it also holds in solution. Mr. Young’s process consisted\r\nin placing the mineral in a retort encased in brickwork—an arrangement\r\nwhich caused the temperature of the retort to be more uniform than if\r\nthe heat of the furnace had been applied to it directly. The retorts\r\nwere placed vertically, and they were fed with the mineral by a hopper\r\nat the top. The products of the distillation passed through a worm tube\r\nsurrounded by cold water into a cooled receiver. The result of the first\r\ndistillation was a crude oily matter, differing from tar in being\r\nlighter than water, and in not drying-up when exposed to the air. This\r\ncrude oil was then several times alternately treated with sulphuric acid\r\nand caustic potash, and distilled; and when about two-thirds of the oil\r\nhad been separated from the rest, as an oil for burning and lubricating\r\npurposes, the residue yielded paraffin, or “paraffin wax,” as it is\r\nsometimes called. It is estimated that in Scotland no less than 800,000\r\ntons of shale are annually distilled for mineral hydro-carbons, with a\r\nconsumption of 500,000 tons of fuel. It is believed that about\r\n25,000,000 gallons of crude oil are thus obtained, and from this 350,000\r\ngallons of illuminating oil, 10,000 tons of lubricating oil, and 5,800\r\ntons of solid paraffin are produced. Among the products exhibited in the\r\nInternational Exhibition of 1862, was a block of beautifully translucent\r\nparaffin, of nearly half a ton weight.\r\n\r\nParaffin is also obtained on the continent by distilling a variety of\r\ncoal termed _lignite_. The tar which comes over is distilled, until\r\nnothing but coke remains. The condensed products are then treated with\r\ncaustic soda, in order to remove carbolic acid and other substances.\r\nAfter washing with water, the oils are treated with sulphuric acid, in\r\norder to remove basic substances. The oil is again washed, and is then\r\nrectified by another distillation. The products which successively come\r\nover are, if necessary, separated by being collected in different\r\nvessels; but sometimes they are mixed together, and sent into the market\r\nas illuminating oils under various names, such as “photogen,” “solar\r\noil,” &c. Oils having a specific gravity about 0·9 are collected apart,\r\nand are placed in tanks in a very cool place. In the course of a few\r\nweeks the solid paraffin, which is dissolved in the other hydro-carbons,\r\ncrystallizes out. The liquid oils are drawn off, and the crude paraffin,\r\nwhich is of a dark colour, is freed from adhering oil by a centrifugal\r\nmachine, and afterwards by pressure applied by hydraulic power. It then\r\nundergoes several other processes of purification before it is obtained\r\nas a colourless translucent solid.\r\n\r\nSeveral thousand tons of paraffin are annually consumed for making\r\ncandles, which is the most important application of the material. The\r\nvariation in the fusing-points of different specimens is doubtless due\r\nto admixtures in greater or less proportion of other more easily fusible\r\nhydro-carbons. It was on account of the imperfect separation of these\r\nthat the candles first made from paraffin were so liable to soften and\r\nbend, and felt greasy to the touch. Paraffin for candle-making is\r\nsometimes mixed with a certain proportion of other substances, such as\r\npalmitic acid, &c. Among the patented applications of paraffin are the\r\nlining of beer-barrels, and the preserving of fruits, jams, and meat.\r\nSome kinds of paraffin are also used in the manufacture of matches.\r\n\r\nLiebig once expressed a wish that coal-gas might be obtained in a solid\r\nform: “It would certainly be esteemed one of the greatest discoveries of\r\nthe age if any one could succeed in condensing coal-gas into a white,\r\ndry, odourless substance, portable and capable of being placed in a\r\ncandlestick or burned in a lamp.” Now, it is curious that paraffin has\r\nnearly the same composition as good coal-gas: it burns with a bright and\r\nsmokeless flame, and beautiful candles are formed of it, which burn like\r\nthose made of the finest wax. When the fused paraffin first assumes the\r\nsolid form, it is transparent like glass; and if it could be retained in\r\nthat condition, we might have the pleasing novelty of transparent\r\ncandles. But the particles seek to arrange themselves in crystalline\r\nforms, and the substance soon takes on its white semi-opaque appearance.\r\n\r\nThe great richness of the Boghead mineral in paraffin, which appears to\r\nexist in it ready formed, prevented for many years any successful\r\ncompetition by the working of other sources of supply. But paraffin is\r\nan abundant constituent of Rangoon petroleum, and considerable\r\nquantities may be obtained by distilling peat, and other fossil\r\nsubstances. All petroleums and paraffins are, in fact, mixtures of a\r\nnumber of hydro-carbons, which in many cases cannot be entirely\r\nseparated from each other. The accidents which have from time to time\r\noccurred with some of these combustibles, and have caused legislative\r\nenactments with regard to them, are due to the imperfect removal by\r\ndistillation of the more volatile bodies, which rise in vapour at\r\nordinary temperatures. Explosions of the hydro-carbons can occur only\r\nunder the same circumstances as with coal-gas; that is to say, the\r\napplication of a flame to a mixture of the vapour with atmospheric air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 346.—_View of the City of London Gas-works._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               COAL-GAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen coal is burning in a common fire, we may see jets of smoky gas\r\nissuing from the pieces of coal before they become red hot. This vapour,\r\ncoming in contact with flame in another part of the fire, may often be\r\nobserved to ignite, thus supplying an instance of gas-lighting in its\r\nmost elementary form. In the ordinary fire the air has free access, and\r\nthe inflammable gases and vapours continue to burn with flames more or\r\nless bright, and when these have ceased the carbonaceous portion\r\ncontinues afterward to glow until nearly the whole has been consumed,\r\nexcept the solid residue which we call the ashes. These ashes in general\r\ncontain a portion of unconsumed carbon, mixed with what is chemically\r\n_the ash_, namely, certain incombustible salts, constituting the white\r\npart of the ashes. If, however, we heat the coal in a vessel which\r\nprevents access of air, and allows the gases to escape, the coal is\r\ndecomposed much in the same way as when it is burnt in the open fire;\r\nbut the products formed are no longer burnt, the supply of oxygen being\r\ncut off. Every one knows the familiar experiment of filling the bowl of\r\na common clay tobacco-pipe with powdered coal, then covering it with a\r\ndab of clay, and placing it in a fire. The gas which soon comes from the\r\nstem of the pipe does not take fire unless a light be applied, when it\r\nmay be seen to burn with a bright flame, and after the flow of gas has\r\nceased, nearly the whole of the carbon of the coal will be found\r\nunconsumed in the bowl of the pipe. This simple experiment illustrates\r\nperfectly the first step in the manufacture of coal-gas, namely, the\r\nprocess of heating coal to redness in closed vessels, by which operation\r\nthe substances originally contained in coal are destroyed, and their\r\nelements enter into new combinations.\r\n\r\nThese elements are few in number; for, except the very small portion\r\nwhich remains as incombustible white ash, coal is constituted of carbon,\r\nhydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and a little sulphur. All the varied and\r\ninteresting products obtained by the destructive distillation of coal\r\nare combinations of two or more of these four or five elements.\r\nIlluminating gas is far from being the only product when coal is heated\r\nwithout access of air; for of the numerous substances volatized at the\r\nred heat of the gas-retort a great number are not only incapable of\r\naffording light, but liable to generate noxious compounds when burnt.\r\nBesides this there are numerous bodies which, though leaving the retort\r\nin the gaseous form, immediately assume the liquid or solid state at\r\nordinary temperatures. All such substances must be separated before\r\npermanent gases are obtained fit for illuminating purposes and capable\r\nof being carried through pipes to distant places. Thus an important part\r\nof the apparatus for gas manufacture consists in arrangements for\r\nseparating the condensable bodies, and for removing useless or injurious\r\ngases from the remainder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 347.—_Section of Gas-making Apparatus._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe products resulting from the destructive distillation of the coal\r\nmay, therefore, be classified as—_a_, solids left behind in the retort;\r\n_b_, solids and liquids condensed by cooling the vapours which issue\r\nfrom the retort; _c_, coal-gas—a mixture of gases from which certain\r\nuseless and noxious constituents must be removed. Fig. 347 is intended\r\nto give a diagrammatic view of the apparatus employed in the generation,\r\npurification, and storage of gas, the various parts being shown in\r\nsection. A is the furnace containing several retorts, of which B is one.\r\nFrom each retort a tube, _d_, rises vertically, and curving downward\r\nlike an inverted U, it enters a long horizontal cylinder, _f_; half\r\nfilled with water, beneath the surface of which the open end of the\r\nrecurved tube dips. The cylinder containing water passes horizontally\r\nalong the whole range of furnaces in the gas-works, and is known as the\r\n_hydraulic main_. It is here, then, the tar and the moisture first\r\ncondense, and the pipe is always kept half full of these liquids, so\r\nthat the ends of the pipes, _d_, from the retorts, dipping beneath its\r\nsurface, form traps or water-valves, which allow any retort to be opened\r\nwithout permitting the gas to escape. As the tar accumulates in the\r\nhydraulic main, it flows over through a pipe, _g_, leading downwards\r\ninto the _tar-well_, H. The gases take the same course; but while the\r\ntar flows down the vertical tube, R, the gases pass on through _j_ into\r\nthe condensers or refrigerators. Gas cannot escape from the open end of\r\nthe tube, for it is always closed by the liquids—tar and ammoniacal\r\nliquor—which accumulate and flow over the top of the open inner vessel\r\ninto the cistern, S, from which they are drawn off from time to time by\r\nthe stop-cock, I. Although when the gas has arrived at this cistern much\r\nof its tar and ammoniacal vapours have been condensed, a portion is\r\nstill retained by reason of the high temperature of the gas; and this\r\nhas to be removed before it is permitted to enter the purifier. This is\r\nthe object of passing the gas through the series of pipes, _j j_,\r\nforming the _condenser_. These are kept cool by the large surface they\r\nexpose to the air, and, when necessary, cold water from the cistern, K,\r\nmay be made to flow over them. The tar and other liquids condense in the\r\niron chest, T, which is so divided by partitions as to compel the gas to\r\npass through the whole series of tubes; and as the liquid accumulates,\r\nit also overflows into the tar-well. The cooled gas then enters the\r\npurifier, L L, in which are layers of slaked lime placed on a number of\r\nshelves. By contact with the extensive surface of slaked lime the gas\r\nhas its sulphuretted hydrogen, carbonic acid, and some other impurities,\r\nremoved; and it then, through the tube _n_, enters the gasholder, in\r\nwhich it is stored up for use.\r\n\r\nHydrated oxide of iron is now much used for purifying coal-gas. The\r\noxide is mixed with sawdust, and placed in layers 10 in. thick. Sulphide\r\nof iron and water is formed; and when the mixture has ceased to absorb\r\nany more, it is removed and exposed to a current of air; the hydrated\r\noxide is thus reproduced and sulphur set free. The process may be\r\nrepeated many times in succession, until the absorbent power is impaired\r\nby the accumulation of sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe gasholder—or “gasometer,” as it is often improperly named—is an\r\nimmense cylindrical bell, made of wrought iron plates, and inverted in a\r\ntank of water, in which it rises or falls. It is counterpoised by\r\nweights attached to chains passing over pulleys, so as to press the gas\r\nwith a small force in order to drive it along the main, which\r\ncommunicates with the pipes supplying it to the various consumers. The\r\npressure impelling the gas through the mains does not in general exceed\r\nthat of a column of water two or three inches high.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary, after this slight outline describing the essential\r\nparts of the apparatus, to enter more fully into the details of the\r\nseveral parts.\r\n\r\nThe retorts are constructed of wrought iron, cast iron, or earthenware,\r\nand in shape are cylindrical, with a diameter of 12 in. to 18 in., or\r\nmore, and a length of 6 ft. to 10 ft. Though sometimes circular in\r\nsection, other forms are commonly used—such as the elliptical, and\r\nespecially the ⌓-shaped. The retorts are closed except at the mouth-end,\r\nFig. 348, from the top of which rises the stand-pipe, A, which has\r\nusually a diameter of about 5 in. When the charge has been introduced,\r\nthe mouth is closed by a plate of iron, B, closely and securely applied\r\nby means of a screw, C, as shown in the figure—a perfectly tight joint\r\nbeing obtained by a luting of lime mortar spread on the part of the lid\r\nwhich comes into contact with the mouth of the retort. The retorts are\r\nalways set horizontally in the furnace—each furnace usually including a\r\nset of five retorts. The charge of coals is introduced on a tray of\r\nsheet iron adapted to the size of the retort, which, when properly\r\npushed in, is inverted so as turn out the contents, and then withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe time required to completely expel the volatile constituents from the\r\ncharge in a gas retort varies very much, because there are great\r\ndiversities in the composition of the different kinds of coal employed.\r\nSome varieties of coal, such as cannel, are easily decomposed, and the\r\noperation may be complete in about three hours; while other kinds may\r\nrequire double that time. The quantity of gas procurable from a given\r\nweight of coal also varies according to the kind of coal made use of.\r\nThus, while a hundredweight of cannel may give 430 cubic feet of gas,\r\nthe same weight of Newcastle coals will yield but 370 cubic feet. The\r\nnature of the gases given off from a retort will be different at the\r\ndifferent stages of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe scene presented by the retort-house of a large gas manufactory, when\r\nviewed at night, is a singular spectacle. The strange lurid gleams which\r\nshoot out amid the general darkness as the retorts are opened to\r\nwithdraw the coke, and the black forms of the workmen partially\r\nilluminated by the glare, or flitting like dark shadows across it, form\r\na picture which might engage the pencil of a Rembrandt. In Fig. 348_a_\r\nis depicted the retort-house at the Imperial Gas Works, King’s Cross.\r\nHere the retorts are arranged in several tiers—the coal being brought,\r\nand the coke withdrawn, by the aid of an iron carriage running on rails\r\nparallel to the line of furnaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 348.—_The Retort._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the process of heating, a proper regulation of the temperature is of\r\nthe highest importance. It is found that when the retorts are heated to\r\nbright cherry-red, the best results are obtained. At a lower temperature\r\na larger quantity of condensable vapours are given off, which collect in\r\nthe gasholders and distributing pipes as solid or liquid, and occasion\r\nmuch inconvenience, while the quantity of gas obtained is decreased. On\r\nthe other hand, if the temperature be too high, some of the gases are\r\ndecomposed, and the quantity of carbon contained in the product is so\r\nmuch diminished as seriously to impair the illuminating power. Again,\r\nevery second the gases after their production remain in the red-hot\r\nretort diminishes their light-giving value; for those hydro-carbons on\r\nwhich the luminiferous power of the gas depends, are then liable to\r\npartial decomposition; a portion of their carbon is deposited on the\r\nwalls of the retort in a dense layer, gradually choking it up, while the\r\nliberated hydrogen does not add to the illuminating but to the heating\r\nconstituents of the gas. A plan has been patented by Mr. White, of\r\nManchester, for rapidly removing the illuminating gases from the retort\r\nby sweeping them out by means of a current of what has been termed\r\n“water gas.” This water gas is produced by causing steam to pass over\r\nheated coke, and is a mixture of carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, and\r\nhydrogen. Though only two of these are combustible gases—and even they\r\ndo not yield light by their combustion, and, by adding to the bulk of\r\nthe gas, serve rather to dilute it—yet it has been found that in some\r\ncases twice the amount of light is obtainable by White’s process than\r\nthe same weight of coal supplies when treated in the ordinary manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 348_a_.—_Retort House of the Imperial Gas-Works, King’s Cross,\r\n    London._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic main, as already mentioned, being kept half full of tar\r\ninto which the lower ends of the dip-pipes descend, prevents the gas\r\nfrom escaping through the stand-pipes when the lid of a retort is\r\nremoved for the introduction of a fresh charge. The hydraulic main is\r\nfrom 12 to 18 in. diameter, and the dip pipes pass into it by gas-tight\r\njoints. Various forms of purifiers are in use besides the simple one\r\nalready mentioned. Some of these have arrangements for agitating the gas\r\nwith a purifying liquid by mechanical means, the motion being supplied\r\nby a steam engine.\r\n\r\nThe gasholder, as it sinks in the water of the cistern, presses with\r\nless force on the contained gas, and unless this inequality of pressure\r\nwere counteracted there would be very unequal velocities in the flow of\r\ngas from the burner. The equality of pressure is obtained by making the\r\nweight of the chains by which the gasholder is suspended equal to half\r\nthe weight the gasholder loses in the same length of its motion.\r\nGasholders are also constructed without chains or counterpoises, as\r\nthese are found to be unnecessary where the height of the gasholder does\r\nnot exceed half its width. In such cases, especially when the vessel is\r\nvery large, the difference of pressure at the highest and lowest\r\nposition is quite inconsiderable, and nothing more is necessary than\r\nthat upright guides or pillars be placed to preserve the vertical motion\r\nof the vessel. Another improvement, which enables a lofty gasholder to\r\nbe used without increasing the depth of the tank, consists in forming\r\nthe gasholder of several cylinders, which slide in and out of one\r\nanother like the draw-tubes of a telescope. Each cylinder has a groove\r\nformed by turning up the iron inside the rim, and at the top of the next\r\ncylinder the edge is turned outwards so as to drop in the groove or\r\nchannel, which thus forms a gas-tight joint, for it is of course filled\r\nwith water as it rises. The pressure is, however, more accurately\r\nregulated by an apparatus called the _governor_, through which the gas\r\npasses in before it enters the mains. The construction and action of the\r\nregulator will be understood from Fig. 349, where A represents a kind of\r\nminiature gasholder, inverted in the cistern, B. From the centre of the\r\ninterior of the bell hangs a cone, C, within the contracted orifice of\r\nthe inlet-pipe. If this cone be drawn up, the size of the orifice, D, is\r\nreduced, and, on the other hand, by its descent it enlarges the opening\r\nthrough which the gas passes outward. By properly adjusting the weights\r\nof the counterpoise, E, such a position of the cone may be found that\r\nthe gas passes into the mains at an assigned pressure. Suppose, now,\r\nthat from any cause the pressure of gas in F increases, that pressure\r\nacting upon the inverted bell, A, causes it to rise and carry with it\r\nthe cone, which, by narrowing the orifice of the outlet, checks the flow\r\nof gas. Similarly, a decrease of pressure in the mains would be followed\r\nby the descent of the cone, and consequently freer egress of gas. In\r\nhilly towns it is necessary to fix regulators of this kind at certain\r\nheights in order to equalize the pressure. It is found that a difference\r\nof 30 ft. in level affects the pressure of gas in the same main to about\r\nthe same amount as would a column of water one-fifth of an inch high,\r\nthe pressure being least at the lowest point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 349.—_The Gas Governor._\r\n]\r\n\r\nCoal-gas is a mixture of several gases, and these may be classified as,\r\nfirst, the light-giving gases, or those which burn with a luminous\r\nflame; secondly, gases which burn with a non-luminous flame, and which\r\ntherefore contribute to the _heat_, and not to the light, of a\r\ngas-flame, and have the effect of diluting the gas; third, gases and\r\nvapours which are properly termed impurities, as they are either\r\nincombustible or by their combustion give rise to injurious products. Of\r\nthe first kind the principal is olefiant gas, a gas which burns with a\r\nbrilliant white flame without smoke. It is a compound of hydrogen and\r\ncarbon, six parts by weight of carbon being combined with one part by\r\nweight of hydrogen. Besides olefiant gas other gaseous hydro-carbons are\r\nfound in smaller quantities. These contain a larger proportion of carbon\r\nthan olefiant gas. The second class contains hydrogen, light carburetted\r\nhydrogen, and carbonic oxide. Hydrogen is one element of water, of which\r\nit forms one-ninth of the weight. It burns with a flame giving\r\nsingularly little light, but having intensely heating power; in fact,\r\none of the brightest lights we can produce is obtained by allowing the\r\nflame of burning hydrogen to heat a piece of lime. Light carburetted\r\nhydrogen, like olefiant gas, is a compound of hydrogen and carbon, but\r\nthe proportion of carbon to hydrogen is only half what it is in olefiant\r\ngas, namely, three parts to one. This gas enters largely into the\r\ncomposition of coal-gas, and occurs naturally in the coal seams, being,\r\nin fact, the dreaded _fire-damp_ of the miner. It is much lighter than\r\nolefiant gas, for while that gas is of nearly the same specific gravity\r\nas atmospheric air, light carburetted hydrogen is only a little more\r\nthan half that specific gravity. It is this ingredient of coal-gas which\r\nrenders it so light as to be available for inflating balloons. It burns\r\nwith either a bluish or a slightly yellow flame, yielding hardly any\r\nlight. Olefiant gas and the other luminiferous hydro-carbons, when\r\nexposed to a bright red heat, split up for the most part into this gas\r\nand carbon. This explains the importance of rapidly removing the gas\r\nfrom the retort in which it is generated, a point which has been\r\nreferred to above. Carbonic oxide is a gas which one may often see\r\nburning with a pale blue flame above the glowing embers of a common\r\nfire, the flame giving, however, little light. It is a compound of\r\ncarbon and oxygen, containing only one-half the quantity of oxygen which\r\nits carbon is capable of uniting with, and therefore ready to unite with\r\nanother proportion, which it does in burning, carbonic acid being the\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nThe third class of constituents of coal-gas—the impurities—are those\r\nwhich the manufacturer strives to remove by passing the gas over lime,\r\nmilk of lime, oxide of iron, &c. Sulphuretted hydrogen, a compound of\r\nsulphur and hydrogen, has an extremely nauseous odour resembling that of\r\nrotten eggs. It is always formed in the distillation of coal, and if not\r\nremoved from the gas in the process of purification, it has a very\r\nobjectionable effect; for one product of its combustion is sulphurous\r\nacid, and in a room where such gas is burnt much damage may be done by\r\nthe acid vapours; for example, the bindings of books, &c., soon become\r\ndeteriorated from this cause. The detection of sulphuretted hydrogen in\r\ncoal-gas is quite easy, for it is only necessary to hold in a current of\r\nthe gas a piece of paper dipped in a solution of the acetate of lead. If\r\nin a few minutes the paper becomes discoloured the presence of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen is indicated.\r\n\r\nBut the _bête noire_ of the gas-maker is a substance called “sulphide of\r\ncarbon,” which is formed whenever sulphur and carbonaceous matters are\r\nbrought together at an elevated temperature. Sulphide of carbon is, in\r\nthe pure state, a colourless liquid, of an intensely offensive odour,\r\nresembling the disagreeable effluvia of putrefying cabbages. The liquid\r\nis extremely volatile, and coal-gas usually contains some of its vapour.\r\nWhen too high a temperature is used in the generation of the gas, it\r\ncontains a large quantity of this deleterious ingredient, especially if\r\nthe amount of sulphur contained in the coal is at all considerable. This\r\nsulphide of carbon vapour is very inflammable, and one product of its\r\ncombustion is a large quantity of sulphurous acid. This substance cannot\r\nbe removed from coal-gas by any process sufficiently cheap to admit of\r\nits application on the large scale. It is said, however, that by passing\r\nthe gas over a solution of potash in methylated spirit, the sulphide of\r\ncarbon vapour can be completely got rid of. The price of these materials\r\nrenders the process available in special cases only, where the damage\r\ndone by the sulphurous acid would be serious, as in libraries, &c.\r\nBesides the impurities we have already enumerated, many others are\r\npresent in greater or less quantity. Carbonic acid—the gas resulting\r\nfrom the complete combustion of carbon—should be entirely removed by the\r\nlime purifiers, as the presence of even a small percentage detracts\r\nmaterially from the illuminating power. This gas is not inflammable and\r\ncannot support combustion. It has decided acid properties, and readily\r\nunites with alkaline bases forming carbonates: it is upon this behaviour\r\nthat its removal by lime depends. The illuminating power of coal-gas\r\ncontaining only 1 per cent. of carbonic acid is reduced thereby by about\r\none-fifteenth of its whole amount.\r\n\r\nThe proper mode of burning the gas so as to obtain the maximum amount of\r\nlight it is capable of yielding requires a compliance with certain\r\nphysical and chemical conditions. The artificial production of light\r\ndepends upon the fact that by sufficiently heating any substance, it\r\nbecomes luminous, and the higher the temperature the greater the\r\nluminosity. The light emitted by solid bodies moderately heated is at\r\nfirst red in colour; as the temperature rises it becomes yellow, which\r\ngradually changes to white when the heat becomes very intense. The\r\nwidest difference exists, however, in the temperature required to render\r\nsolids or liquids luminous, and that needed to cause gases to give off\r\nlight. In all luminous flames the light is emitted by _solid_ particles\r\nhighly heated. Every luminous gas-flame contains solid particles of\r\ncarbon, as may be easily shown by the soot deposited on any cold\r\nbody—such as a piece of metal—introduced into the flame. On the other\r\nhand, the flame of burning hydrogen, which produces only aqueous vapour,\r\nfurnishes no light, but a heat so intense, that a piece of lime\r\nintroduced into the jet becomes luminous to a degree hardly supportable\r\nby the eye. The conditions requisite, therefore, for burning\r\nilluminating gas are, first, just such a supply of air as will prevent\r\nparticles of carbon from escaping unconsumed in the form of smoke, and\r\nyet not enough to burn up the carbon before it has separated from the\r\nhydrogen, and passed through the flame in the _solid_ state; second, the\r\nattainment of the highest possible temperature in the flame, compatible\r\nwith the former condition. When the supply of oxygen is not in excess,\r\nthe hydrogen of the gaseous hydro-carbon appears to burn first; the\r\ncarbon is set free, and its solid particles immersed in the flame of the\r\nburning hydrogen are there intensely heated; but ultimately reaching the\r\nouter part of the flame, they enter into combination with the oxygen of\r\nthe air, producing carbonic acid; or if present in excessive quantity,\r\nthey are thrown off as smoke. If the purpose of burning the gas is to\r\nobtain heating effects only, this is accomplished by supplying air in\r\nsuch quantities, that the carbon enters into combination with oxygen in\r\nthe body of the flame, without a previous separation from the hydrogen\r\nwith which it is combined. In this case a higher temperature is\r\nattained, and the flame is wholly free from smoke; so that vessels of\r\nany kind placed over it remain perfectly clean and free from the least\r\ndeposit of soot. The last result is of great advantage in chemical\r\nprocesses, especially where glass vessels require to be heated, for the\r\nchemist retains an uninterrupted view of the actions taking place in his\r\nflasks and retorts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 350.—_Bunsen’s Burner._\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo better illustration of the nature of the combustion in a gas-flame\r\ncan be found than is furnished by Bunsen’s burner, Fig. 350, now\r\nuniversally employed as a source of heat in chemical laboratories. In\r\nthis burner the gas issues from a small orifice at the level of _a_,\r\nnear the bottom of the tube, _b_, which is open at the top, and is in\r\nfree communication at the bottom with openings through which air enters\r\nand mixes with the gas, as they rise together in the tube and are\r\nignited at the top. If the pressure of the gas be properly regulated,\r\nthe flame does not descend in the tube, but the mixture burns at the top\r\nof the tube, producing a pale blue flame incapable of emitting light,\r\nbut much hotter than an ordinary flame, for the combustion is much\r\nquicker. If the openings at _a_ be stopped, the supply of air to the\r\ninterior of the tube is cut off, and then the gas burns at the top of\r\nthe tube, _b_, in the ordinary manner, giving a luminous flame. Ordinary\r\ngas-jets burning in the streets, at open stalls or shops, may be seen on\r\na windy night to have their light almost extinguished by the increased\r\nsupply of oxygen, carried mechanically into the body of the flame, the\r\nwhite light instantly changing to pale blue. The disappearance of the\r\nlight in such cases is due, as in Bunsen’s burner, to the supply of\r\noxygen in sufficient quantity to combine at once with the carbon as well\r\nas the hydrogen of the hydro-carbons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 351.—_Faraday’s Ventilating Gas-burner._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe burners now chiefly used for the consumption of coal-gas for\r\nilluminating purposes are the bat’s-wing, the fish-tail, and various\r\nforms of Argand. The bat’s-wing burner is simply a fine slit cut in an\r\niron nipple, and it produces a flat fan-like flame. The fish-tail is\r\nformed by boring two holes so that two jets of gas inclined at an angle\r\nof about 60° infringe on each other and produce a flat sheet of flame.\r\nThe Argand, in its simplest form, consists of a tubular ring perforated\r\nwith a number of small holes from which the gas issues. Many\r\nmodifications of this kind of burner have been devised, in all of which\r\na glass chimney is requisite to obtain a current of air sufficient to\r\nconsume the gas without smoke, and it is important that the height of\r\nthe chimney should be adapted to the amount of light required if the gas\r\nis to be used economically. Argand burners are specially advantageous\r\nwhere a concentrated light is required. Fig. 351 represents a\r\nventilating gas-burner, contrived by Faraday, the object being to remove\r\nfrom the apartment the whole of the products of the combustion of the\r\ngas. A is the pipe conveying the gas to the Argand burner, B, the flame\r\nof which is enclosed in the usual cylindrical glass chimney, C C, open\r\nat the top. This is enclosed in a wider glass cylinder closed at the top\r\nby a double disc of talc, D D, and opening at its base into the\r\nventilating tube, E E. The direction of the currents produced by the\r\nheat of the flame is shown by the arrows. The whole is entirely enclosed\r\nby a globe of ground glass. Means are provided for regulating the\r\ndraught in the pipe, E E, which, when heated, creates of itself a strong\r\ncurrent of air through the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe illuminating power of coal-gas may be measured directly by comparing\r\nthe intensity of the light emitted by a gas-flame consuming a known\r\nquantity of gas per hour with the light yielded by some standard source.\r\nThe standard usually employed is a spermaceti candle burning at the rate\r\nof 120 grains of sperm per hour. It is not necessary that the candle\r\nactually used should consume exactly this amount, but the consumption of\r\nsperm by the candle during the course of each experiment is ascertained\r\nby the loss of weight, and the results obtained are easily reduced to\r\nthe standard of 120 grains per hour. An instrument is used for\r\ndetermining the relative intensities of the illumination, called\r\nBunsen’s photometer. It consists of a graduated rule, or bar of wood or\r\nmetal, about 10 ft. long. At one end of this bar is placed the standard\r\ncandle, at the other is the gas-flame. A stand slides along the rule\r\nsupporting a circular paper screen at the level of the two flames, and\r\nat right angles to the line joining them. This paper screen is made of\r\nthin writing-paper, which has been brushed over with a solution of\r\nspermaceti, except a spot in the centre, or, more simply, a grease-spot\r\nis made in the middle of a piece of paper. In consequence the paper\r\nsurrounding the spot is much more transparent; yet when it is placed so\r\nthat both sides are equally illuminated, a spectator will not perceive\r\nthe spot in the centre when viewing the screen on either side. When the\r\nscreen has been placed by trial in such a position between the two\r\nsources of light, it is only necessary to measure its distance from each\r\nflame in order to compute the number of times the illuminating power of\r\nthe gas-flame exceeds that of the candle. This computation is based on\r\nthe fact that the intensity of the light from any source diminishes as\r\nthe square of the distance from the source. Thus, if a sheet of paper be\r\nilluminated by a candle at 2 ft. distance, it will receive only\r\none-fourth of the light that would fall upon it were its distance but 1\r\nft., and if removed to 3 ft. distance it has only one-ninth of the\r\nlight. In the instrument used for measuring the illuminating power of\r\ngas the rule is graduated in accordance with this law, so that the\r\nrelative intensities may be read off at once. The gas passes through a\r\nmeter for measuring accurately the quantity per minute which is consumed\r\nby the burner, and there is also a gauge for ascertaining the pressure.\r\nAnother mode of estimating the illuminating power of coal-gas is by\r\ndetermining the quantity of carbon contained in a given volume. For, in\r\ngeneral, the richness of the gas in carbon is a fair index of the\r\nquantity of its luminiferous constituents. This may be readily effected\r\nby exploding the gas with oxygen, and measuring the amount of carbonic\r\nacid produced. Still more accurate determinations of the illuminating\r\nvalue of gas may be obtained by a detailed chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nThe illuminating power of any gas is so calculated that it represents\r\nthe number of times that the light emitted by a jet of the gas, burning\r\nat the rate of 5 cubic feet per hour, exceeds the light given off by the\r\nstandard sperm candle burning 120 grains of sperm per hour. For example,\r\nwhen it is said that the illuminating power of London gas is 13, it is\r\nmeant that when the gas is burnt in an ordinary burner at the rate of 5\r\ncubic feet per hour, the light is equal to that given by thirteen sperm\r\ncandles burning together 13 × 120 grains per hour. The quality of gas\r\nvaries very much, as it depends upon the kind of coal employed, and upon\r\nthe mode in which the manufacture is conducted. The following are the\r\nresults of experiments made to determine the illuminating power of the\r\ngas supplied to several large towns:\r\n\r\n                                     Candles.\r\n                          London       12·1\r\n                          Paris        12·3\r\n                          Birmingham   15·0\r\n                          Berlin       15·5\r\n                          Carlisle     16·0\r\n                          Liverpool    22·0\r\n                          Manchester   22·0\r\n                          Glasgow      28·0\r\n\r\nThe relative quantities of tar, ammonia water, and coke yielded in\r\nvarious gas manufactories also vary very considerably for the same\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of gas illumination the consumers were charged\r\naccording to the number of burners; but this arrangement proved so\r\nunsatisfactory that the _gas-meter_ became a necessity, and already in\r\n1817 meters had been devised, which were not essentially different from\r\nthose now in use. Although gas is used in so many houses, there are few\r\npersons who have any notion of the mechanism of the gas-meter. Our space\r\nwill not allow full details of the construction, but the following\r\nparticulars may be mentioned. In the ordinary “wet” meter there is a\r\ndrum divided into four compartments by radiating partitions; this drum\r\nrevolves on a horizontal axis, and the lower half of the drum, or rather\r\nmore, is beneath the surface of water contained in the case, the water\r\nbeing at the same level inside and outside the drum. The gas enters one\r\nof the closed chambers formed between the surface of the water and a\r\npartition of the drum. Its pressure tends to increase the size of the\r\nchamber, hence the drum revolves. The preceding division of the drum\r\nbeing filled with gas, this is driven into the exit pipe by the motion\r\nof the drum, as it is included in a space comprised between the water\r\nand a partition. Each division in turn comes into communication with the\r\ngas-main, and as it is filled passes on towards the position in which a\r\npassage is opened for it to the exit-pipe. Each turn of the drum,\r\ntherefore, carries forward a definite quantity of gas, and the only\r\nthing necessary is a train of wheels, to register the number of\r\nrevolutions made by the drum. The “wet” meter is much inferior in almost\r\nevery respect to the “dry” meter, in which no water is used. The\r\nprinciple of the “dry” meter is very simple. The gas pours into an\r\nexpanding chamber, partly constructed of a flexible material, and which\r\nmay be compared to the bellows of a circular accordion. The expansion is\r\nmade to compress another similar chamber, already filled with gas, which\r\nis thus forced through the exit-pipe. When the first chamber has\r\nexpanded to a definite volume, it moves a lever, and this reverses the\r\ncommunications. The expanded chamber is now opened to the exit-pipe, and\r\nthe other to the entrance-pipe, and so on alternately. A train of wheels\r\nregisters the number of movements on a set of dials.\r\n\r\nRecent years have brought no essential changes in the methods of gas\r\nmaking, although of course improvements in many minor details of the\r\nprocesses and of the apparatus have been effected. These demand no\r\ndescription at our hands, as they are of interest only to those\r\nconcerned with the actual technology of gas-making, nor need some of the\r\nlater forms of burners for using the gas be noticed, as these are\r\nsufficiently familiar. They really do effect a considerable economy in\r\nthe consumption of gas, especially in cases where a more powerful light\r\nis required. But the reader will have already learnt from a foregoing\r\nsection on Electric Lighting that the importance of gas as an illuminant\r\nis already on the wane. Indeed, it will not be too much to say that,\r\nbefore the close of the present century, every town will have its\r\nstreets, and still more certainly, all its places of public assembly,\r\nsuch as theatres, concert halls, churches, libraries, &c., fitted with\r\ninstallations for electric illumination, and even in shops and private\r\nhouses, it is probable that before long, gas will be superseded by the\r\nelectric light. Some of the disadvantages of burning gas have already\r\nbeen referred to, and the danger attending its accidental escape into\r\napartments is illustrated by the yearly tale of victims to suffocation\r\nand violent explosions. The inherent disadvantage of gas used as an\r\nilluminant, is the enormous quantity of heat produced by its combustion,\r\ncompared with the amount of light evolved. The absolute quantity of heat\r\nrequired to render a body highly luminous is really very small, for\r\nmasses of matter almost inappreciable become very luminous, provided\r\nonly that their _temperature_ be sufficiently raised. Thus, for example,\r\nthe few residual particles of gas in a Geissler’s tube (p. 431) become\r\nincandescent by electrical discharges, while the number of them is too\r\nsmall to sensibly heat the glass vessel, and the very attenuated carbon\r\nfilament in an electric glow lamp suffices by the mere contraction and\r\nconcentration of the current within it raising its temperature high\r\nenough, to diffuse a brighter light than a large gas-flame. This\r\nexplains the fact alluded to elsewhere, that if instead of burning the\r\ngas we use it in a gas engine, driving a dynamo connected with an\r\nelectric light installation, we shall obtain a much greater luminous\r\neffect. As there is no combustion, the surrounding air is neither heated\r\nnor deteriorated with gaseous products and smoke.\r\n\r\nWithout any rivalry from the electric-light, gas, as a domestic\r\nluminant, has now met with a competitor on the ground of cheapness in\r\nthe mineral oils mentioned in the preceding article. If these could be\r\ndeprived of their unpleasant odour, and a perfectly safe lamp contrived\r\nfor burning them, it would be only under very favourable conditions that\r\ngas could compete with them on the score of economy. But of late years\r\ntwo applications of gas to other purposes than to illumination will have\r\nbeen observed. First to heating, for warming, cooking, and other\r\ndomestic purposes, and also in various processes in the arts. In all the\r\nappliances so used, the principle of Bunsen’s burner (p. 722) is\r\nadopted, and stoves, fireplaces, and kitchen-ranges, heated by gas have\r\nobvious advantages in their greater cleanliness and readiness. The other\r\nnew application of gas is as a motive power in the gas engine, by which\r\na very convenient supply of mechanical energy is afforded. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that in the future, gas will be greatly used for these\r\npurposes, and perhaps be for them consumed as largely as at present. A\r\nsingular thing in the history of gas-manufacture is the great value that\r\nthe bye-products have attained, that is to say, the ammoniacal liquor,\r\nthe coke, and especially the tar. So many valuable substances are now\r\nderived from this last, that even if coal should cease to be\r\ndestructively distilled for gas, the operation would still be largely\r\ncarried on if only for the tar.\r\n\r\nA jet of hydrogen gas burning in a dark room is all but invisible, yet\r\nno gas can give so intense a heat. The lime-light, which no doubt is\r\nperfectly familiar to everyone as an illuminant in magic lantern\r\nprojections, is simply a jet of mixed hydrogen and oxygen gases directed\r\non a piece of lime, which is rendered incandescent by the heat. The\r\nflame of the Bunsen burner (p. 772) is distinguishable only by a very\r\npale blue colour, and it is impossible to discern objects, or to read by\r\nits light in an otherwise dark room. But if a piece of thin platinum\r\nwire formed into a coil, as by twisting round a pencil, be introduced\r\ninto the flame, the wire will glow with great brilliancy, and its\r\nthickness will seem much increased. It will, in fact, emit so much light\r\nthat reading by its glow becomes easy. This shows that, as already\r\nstated, a solid will give off light at a temperature which scarcely\r\nsuffices to make a gas visible. Thus a Bunsen burner flame can be made\r\nto give light simply by putting into it some incombustible solid, which\r\nitself incapable or suffering any chemical change under the conditions,\r\nnevertheless becomes luminous by merely acquiring the temperature of the\r\nalmost invisible heated gas. The cause of the luminosity of the ordinary\r\ngas burner, as compared with the almost invisible Bunsen burner flame,\r\nhas, indeed, been already explained on a previous page, but the\r\nphenomenon is again, by the experiment just referred to, brought clearly\r\nbefore our attention; and it becomes obvious that substances other than\r\nthe carbon of the hydro-carbon constituents of the coal gas will emit\r\nrays of light. Chemical analysis shows that by far the larger proportion\r\nof the constituents of ordinary coal-gas consist of gases which do not\r\nthemselves produce luminous flames, and that, taking 16 candle-gas,\r\nabout 10 candles of the illuminating power is due to compounds of which\r\nthe gas does not contain more than 4 per cent. Nearly half the bulk of\r\npurified coal-gas is hydrogen, which itself gives no light whatever when\r\nburnt; marsh-gas, which burns with only a slight luminosity, forms 35\r\nper cent. of ordinary coal-gas; and there is usually present about 7 per\r\ncent. of carbonic oxide, which in burning gives only a pale blue flame.\r\nThis shows that by far the greatest product of the combustion of\r\ncoal-gas is not light but heat. The flame of hydrogen is much the\r\nhottest known, and as that gas enters so largely into the composition of\r\ncoal-gas, and the complete combustion of all the other constituents\r\ntakes place when the gas is previously mixed with air, as in the Bunsen\r\nburner, we are provided with an economical means of obtaining high\r\ntemperatures. But coal-gas was in the first instance intended to provide\r\nus with a cheap illuminant, and although for some time the gas itself\r\nwas very impure, and it was long before the crude appliances for burning\r\nit were superseded by contrivances giving steadier and more brilliant\r\nlights, such as the Argand and the regenerative burners. It is only\r\nquite recently that the full illuminating possibilities of coal-gas have\r\nbeen developed by the happy notion of converting the heating power of\r\nits flame into light-giving power, by the simple plan of suspending a\r\nsuitable solid over the hot but non-luminous Bunsen burner.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which an effective method of doing this was discovered is\r\nnot a little curious. The construction of the ordinary incandescent\r\nelectric lamp, Fig. 280_h_, involves the necessity of enclosing the\r\ncarbon filament in an exhausted glass bulb; and it was when Auer von\r\nWelsbach was engaged in attempting to find some substance that could be\r\nbrought into incandescence by the electric current, and yet be\r\nincombustible even in the open air, that his investigations led to the\r\ninvention we have now to describe—an invention apparently destined to\r\ngive a new lease of life to coal-gas illumination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 351_a_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 351_b_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is singular also that Welsbach, in seeking for the most suitable\r\nmaterials for heating to incandescence in the Bunsen burner flame,\r\nshould find them in certain very rare minerals, containing a group of\r\nelements formerly of interest only to the scientific chemist, and up to\r\nthat time devoid of any practical applications. The names of these\r\nelements, the oxides of which are called “earths,” will, of course, be\r\nstrange to non-chemical readers, but we give their names, with the\r\nremark that the nearest familiar substance they at all resemble is\r\naluminium, of which the oxide, or “earth,” is alumina. These rare\r\nmetals, the oxides of which are the materials of the Welsbach “mantle,”\r\nare all discoveries of the present century, or nearly so, and they are\r\ncalled lanthanum, zirconium, thorium, cerium, didymium, yttrium, erbium,\r\n&c. They occur as silicates or phosphates very sparingly, and in a few\r\nlocalities in Norway; but some of them have now been found more\r\nabundantly in America. The minerals, from which for the most part the\r\noxides are obtained, are called _monazite_, _orthite_, and _thorite_. It\r\nwas found after many trials that a blend of these earths in certain\r\nproportions gives a mantle that yields a pure white light, while any\r\npreponderance of one or another would impart some tint to the light.\r\nThis proper blending of the constituents forms a great improvement on\r\nthe first mantles, which generally shed a greenish light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 351_c_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 351_d_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _mantles_ are made by an ingenious process, in which a network of\r\ncotton thread is knitted into the form of a tube; this is cut up into\r\nsuitable lengths, and a piece attached to form the top. The network is\r\nthen saturated with a solution of the nitrates of the rare earths\r\nabove-mentioned, and dried on glass rods. After this a loop of asbestos\r\nthread is passed through the top, by which the _mantle_ may be attached\r\nto its support. The mantle is now shaped to the required form, and the\r\ncotton thread burnt off, when a thin skeleton of the oxides is left\r\nreproducing the form of the original network. The mantle is again\r\nstrongly heated, and after cooling is dipped into a solution of\r\ncollodion, dried, and carefully laid in a box. The collodion serves to\r\nstrengthen the mantle sufficiently for transit, for it is very frail,\r\nand would otherwise be liable to fall in pieces by slight shocks. Fig.\r\n351_d_ is a full-sized representation of the completed mantle, and Fig.\r\n351_e_ shows it mounted on the burner, where a rather small flame is\r\nallowed for the first time to play upon it, by which the collodion is\r\nquickly burnt off, and then the chimney-glass is placed over it, as in\r\nFig. 351_a_. In the earlier forms of lamp the lighting of the gas was a\r\nmatter requiring some delicacy of manipulation, for a rude shock, or an\r\nawkward touch might cause the mantle to crumble into ruin, but now the\r\nmakers fit their lamps with a by-pass by which a very small flame is\r\nmaintained within the lamp ready to light up the gas when that is fully\r\nturned on. (Fig. 351_c_.) The makers have also now made the lamps\r\navailable for street lighting, to which the fragility of the mantle was\r\nformerly an obstacle, as it was liable to collapse by the tremor of the\r\ntraffic. This risk has been obviated by providing a spring to support\r\nthe mantle at the base. (Fig. 351_b_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 351_e_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe qualities of the Welsbach lamp have been examined by competent\r\npersons, and from the statements they supply, we extract the following\r\nparticulars. The light is, for the same gas consumption, seven times\r\nthat of an ordinary gas burner; more than four times that of an Argand\r\nburner; more than twice that of a “regenerative” lamp. It follows, of\r\ncourse, that, light for light, the products of combustion, such as\r\ncarbonic acid, heat, &c., amount to only something like ⅙th of those\r\nproduced by ordinary burners, and the consumption of the gas is perfect,\r\nthere being absolutely no smoke. Though the mantles have to be renewed\r\nabout three times a year, when the burners are in constant use, the\r\ntotal cost, light for light, is only ¼th of that of ordinary burners.\r\nThe light of the Welsbach burner is whiter than ordinary gaslight. It is\r\nrich in the blue rays, and, therefore, more like daylight, permitting\r\nwell the comparison of shades of colour, and it is excellently suited\r\nfor workers with the microscope, &c. This new gas-lighting must also be\r\na great boon to photographers using artificial illumination, for the\r\nactinic power is, with the same visual illumination, nearly twice that\r\nof the ordinary gas flame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 352.—_Apparatus for making Magenta._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           COAL-TAR COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoal-tar is an exceedingly complex material, being a mixture of a great\r\nnumber of different substances. The following table shows the chemical\r\nname of many of the substances obtainable from the coal-tar. It must not\r\nbe supposed that these substances exist ready formed in the coal, and\r\nthat they are merely expelled by the heat. We can understand better how\r\nheat, acting upon an apparently simple substance like coal, and one\r\ncontaining so few elements, is able to produce so large a variety of\r\ndifferent bodies, if we remember that heat is the agent most often\r\nemployed to effect chemical changes, and that from even two elements,\r\nvariously combined, bodies differing entirely from each other are\r\nproducible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SUBSTANCES FOUND IN COAL-TAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _a._ COMPOUNDS OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN.\r\n\r\n            Hydrides of amyl, hexyl, heptyl, nonyl, and decyl.\r\n Amylene, hexylene, heptylene, octylene, nonylene, decylene; (paraffin).\r\n                   Benzol, toluol, xylol, cumol, cymol.\r\n                               Naphthalene.\r\n                               Anthracene.\r\n                                 Pyrene.\r\n                                Chrysene.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _b._ COMPOUNDS OF CARBON, HYDROGEN, AND OXYGEN.\r\n\r\n                         Phenol, cresol, phlorol.\r\n                       Rosolic acid, brunolic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _c._ COMPOUNDS OF CARBON, HYDROGEN, AND NITROGEN.\r\n\r\n                           Aniline, toluidine.\r\n Pyridine, picoline, lutidine, collidine, parvoline, coridine, rubidine,\r\n                                viridine.\r\n                     Leucoline, lepidine, cryptidine.\r\n                            Cespitine, pyrrol.\r\n\r\nThis list contains only the names of substances which have actually been\r\nfound in the coal-tar, and it is certain that a number of products must\r\nhave escaped notice. It is obvious, too, that by using coal of different\r\nkinds, and by varying the temperature and pressure at which the\r\noperation of distilling the coal is effected, we shall probably be able\r\nto increase the number of possible constituents of coal-tar almost\r\nindefinitely. The list above presents to the non-chemical reader a\r\nstring of quite unfamiliar names; but, though the system of nomenclature\r\nin chemistry is far from perfect, yet each of these names has a meaning\r\nfor the chemist beyond the mere designation of a substance. The chemical\r\nname aims at showing, or at least suggesting, the composition of a body\r\nand the general class to which it belongs. This may be illustrated by\r\nthe names of hydro-carbons in the above list. The five compounds headed\r\nby benzol have many properties in common, and each one is entirely\r\ndifferent in its chemical behaviour to those which follow amylene. The\r\nGreek numerals enter into the names of the latter, in order to express,\r\nin this case, the number of atoms of carbon which are supposed to be\r\ncontained in each ultimate particle of the body. We write down in\r\nparallel columns the names of these two classes of bodies, together with\r\nthe _symbols_ which represent their composition, reminding the reader\r\nthat the letter C represents carbon; the letter alone indicating _one_\r\natom of that element, but, when followed by a small figure, it implies\r\nthat number of carbon atoms; in like manner H, N, and O represent atoms\r\nof hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen respectively.\r\n\r\n                         Hexylene  C_{6}H_{12}\r\n                         Heptylene C_{7}H_{14}\r\n                         Octylene  C_{8}H_{16}\r\n                         Nonylene  C_{9}H_{18}\r\n                         Decylene  C_{10}H_{20}\r\n                         Benzol    C_{6}H_{6}\r\n                         Toluol    C_{7}H_{8}\r\n                         Xylol     C_{8}H_{10}\r\n                         Cumol     C_{9}H_{12}\r\n                         Cymol     C_{10}H_{14}\r\n\r\nIf these lists be carefully examined, it will be observed that there is\r\na regular progression in the constituent atoms, so that each set of\r\nsubstances forms a series, the differences being always the same. The\r\nvarious bodies contained in the coal-tar are separated from each other\r\nby taking advantage of the fact that each substance has its own\r\nboiling-point; that is, there is a certain temperature, different for\r\neach body, at which it will rise into vapour quickly and continuously.\r\nBenzol, for example, boils at 82° C., toluol at 114° C., and phenol at\r\n188° C.; so that, if we apply heat to a mixture of these three\r\nsubstances, the benzol will boil when the temperature reaches 82°, and\r\nwill pass away in vapour, carrying off heat, so that the temperature\r\nwill not rise until all the benzol has been driven off; then, when the\r\ntemperature reaches 114°, the toluol will begin to come off, but not\r\nuntil that has all passed over into the receiver will the temperature\r\nrise above 114°; and the phenol remaining will distil only at 188°.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of separating bodies when mixed together is by treating\r\nthem with a liquid which acts on, or dissolves out, some of the\r\nconstituents, but not the rest. The coal-tar, as it is received from the\r\ngas-works, is placed in large stills, capable, perhaps, of holding\r\nseveral thousand gallons, and usually made of wrought iron. Stills\r\nsufficiently good for the purpose are commonly constructed from the\r\nworn-out boilers of steam engines. The application of heat, of course,\r\ncauses the more volatile substances to come over first. These are\r\ncondensed and collected apart until products begin to come off which are\r\nheavier than water. The first portion of the distillate, containing the\r\nlighter liquids, is termed “coal naphtha.” The process is continued, and\r\nheavier liquids come over, forming what is called in the trade the “dead\r\noil.” Pitch remains behind in the retort, from which it is usually run\r\nout while hot, but sometimes the distillation is carried a step further.\r\n\r\nThe chief colour-producing substances contained in coal-tar are benzol,\r\ntoluol, phenol, naphthalene, and anthracene. The aniline which is\r\npresent in the tar is very small in amount, and if this ready-formed\r\naniline were our only supply, it would be impossible to make colours\r\nfrom it on an industrial scale. The first of the above-named substances,\r\nbenzol, was discovered by Faraday, in 1825, in liquid produced by\r\nstrongly compressing gas obtained from oil. He called it bicarburet of\r\nhydrogen; but afterwards another chemist, having procured the same body\r\nby distilling benzoic acid with lime, termed it _benzine_. It readily\r\ndissolves fats and oils; and is used domestically for removing\r\ngrease-spots, cleaning gloves, &c., and in the arts as a solvent of\r\nindia-rubber and gutta-percha. It is a very limpid, colourless liquid,\r\nvery volatile, and, when pure, is of a peculiar but not disagreeable\r\nodour. It boils at 82° C., and, cooled to the freezing-point of water,\r\nit solidifies into beautiful transparent crystals, a property which is\r\nsometimes taken advantage of to separate it in a state of purity from\r\nother liquids which do not so solidify.\r\n\r\nBenzol is very inflammable, and its vapour produces an explosive mixture\r\nwith air. The vapour, which is invisible, will run out of any leak in\r\nthe apparatus, like water, and flow along the ground. Accidents have\r\noccurred from this cause, and a case is on record in which the vapour\r\nhaving crept along the floor of the works, was set on fire by a furnace\r\nforty feet away from the apparatus, the flame, of course, running back\r\nto the spot from which the vapour was issuing. Benzol is a dreadful\r\nsubstance for spreading fire should it become ignited, for, being\r\nlighter than water, it floats upon its surface, and therefore the flames\r\ncannot be extinguished in the ordinary way. The discovery of the\r\npresence of benzol in coal-tar was made by Hofman in 1845. It is\r\nobtained from the light oil of coal-tar by first purifying this liquid\r\nby alternately distilling it with steam and treating with sulphuric acid\r\nseveral times. The product so obtained is a colourless liquid, sold as\r\n“rectified coal naphtha,” which, however, has again to be several times\r\nre-distilled with a careful regulation of the temperature, so that the\r\nbenzol may be distilled off from other substances, boiling at a somewhat\r\nhigher temperature, with which it is mixed. Even then the resulting\r\nliquid (commercial benzol) contains notable quantities of toluol. If\r\nbenzol be added in small quantities at a time to very strong and warm\r\nnitric acid, a brisk action takes place, and when after some time water\r\nis added, a yellow oily-looking liquid falls to the bottom of the\r\nvessel. The benzol will have disappeared, for nitric acid under such\r\ncircumstances acts upon it by taking out of each particle an atom of\r\nhydrogen, which it replaces by a _group_ of atoms of nitrogen and\r\noxygen, and, instead of benzol, we have the yellow oil, _nitro-benzol_.\r\nChemists are accustomed to represent actions of this kind by what is\r\ncalled a _chemical equation_, the left-hand side showing the symbols\r\nrepresenting the constitution of the bodies which are placed together,\r\nand the right hand the symbols of the bodies which result from the\r\nchemical action. Here is the equation representing the action we have\r\ndescribed:\r\n\r\n        C_{6}H_{6} +   NO_{2}OH   = C_{6}H_{5}(NO_{2}) +  HOH\r\n         Benzol.     Nitric acid.     Nitro-benzol.      Water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 353.—_Iron Pots for making Nitro-Benzol._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 354.—_Section of Apparatus for making Nitro-Benzol._\r\n]\r\n\r\nNitro-benzol has a sweet taste and a fragrant odour. It is known in\r\ncommerce under the names of artificial oil of bitter almonds and essence\r\nof mirbane, and it has been used for perfuming soap. The chemical action\r\nbetween benzol and concentrated nitric acid is so violent that, when\r\nnitro-benzol first had to be manufactured on the large scale, great\r\ndifficulty was experienced on account of the serious explosions which\r\noccurred. The apparatus now used in making nitro-benzol on the large\r\nscale is represented in Fig. 353, which shows some of the cast-iron\r\npots, of which there is usually a long row. These pots are about 4½ ft.\r\nin diameter, and the same in depth. Each is provided with a stirrer,\r\nwhich is made to revolve by a bevil-wheel, _c_, on its spindle, working\r\nwith a pinion on a shaft, _b_, driven by a steam engine. A layer of\r\nwater is kept on the tops of the lids, the water being constantly passed\r\nin and drawn off through the pipes, _d_, in order to keep it cool. For\r\nthe chemical action is, as usual, attended with heat, which vaporizes\r\nsome of the benzol, but the cold lid re-condenses the vapour, which\r\nwould otherwise escape with the nitrous fumes that pass off by the pipe,\r\n_a_. There is at _e_ an opening, through which the material may be\r\nintroduced, and in the bottom of the vessel is an aperture through which\r\nthe products may be drawn off. Fig. 354 shows a section of one of the\r\ncast-iron vessels, and exhibits the mode in which the spindle of the\r\nstirrer passes through the lid. In the cup, _a_, filled with a liquid, a\r\nkind of inverted cup, which is attached to the spindle, turns round\r\nfreely. It would not do to choose water for the liquid in this cup, for\r\nwater would, by absorbing the nitrous fumes, form an acid capable of\r\nattacking and destroying the spindle. Nothing has been found to answer\r\nbetter for this purpose than nitro-benzol itself. The charge introduced\r\ninto these vessels is a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids together\r\nwith the benzol. During the action, which may last twelve or fourteen\r\ndays, no heat is applied, for the mixture becomes hot spontaneously, and\r\nin fact care must be taken that it does not become too hot. The\r\nnitro-benzol thus obtained is purified by washing with water and\r\nsolution of soda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 355.—_Apparatus for making Aniline._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf nitro-benzol were brought into contact with ordinary hydrogen gas, no\r\naction whatever would take place. But it is well known to chemists that\r\ngases which are just being liberated from a compound have at the\r\n_instant of their generation_ much more powerful chemical properties\r\nthan they possess afterwards. Gases in this condition are said to be in\r\nthe _nascent state_. If we submit nitro-benzol to the action of nascent\r\nhydrogen we find a remarkable change is produced. This change consists,\r\nfirst, in the hydrogen robbing the nitro-benzol of all its oxygen atoms;\r\nsecond, in the addition of hydrogen to the remainder; third, in some\r\nre-arrangement of the atoms, by which a new body is formed. Not that\r\nthese changes are successive, or that we actually know the movement of\r\natoms, but we are thus able to form ideas which correspond with the\r\nfinal result. The new substance is named _aniline_. It is regarded by\r\nchemists as a base; that is, a substance capable of neutralizing and\r\ncombining with an acid to form a _salt_. Its composition is represented\r\nby the symbols C_{6}H_{5} H_{2}N. Aniline was found in coal-tar in 1834,\r\nand even its colour-producing power was noticed, for its discoverer\r\nnamed it _kyanol_, in allusion to the blue colour it produced with\r\nchloride of lime. Later it was obtained by distilling indigo with\r\npotash, and hence received its present name from _anil_, the Portuguese\r\nfor indigo. The quantity of aniline contained in the tar is quite\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nAniline is prepared from nitro-benzol on the large scale by heating it\r\nwith acetic acid and iron filings or iron borings, a process which\r\nrapidly changes the nitro-benzol into aniline. The equation representing\r\nthe change is—\r\n\r\n       C_{6}H_{5}NO_{2} +   H_{6}   = C_{6}H_{5}H_{2}N + 2H_{2}O.\r\n        Nitro-benzol.     Hydrogen.       Aniline.        Water.\r\n\r\nThe operation is effected in the apparatus represented in Fig. 355. It\r\nconsists of a large iron cylinder, within which works a paddle on a\r\nvertical revolving spindle, which, being hollow, is also a pipe to\r\nconvey high pressure steam within the apparatus. Fig. 356 is a section\r\nof the hollow spindle, in which _f_ is the pivot at the bottom of the\r\ncylinder on which it turns; _d_ is the stirring paddle; _e_ is an\r\naperture admitting the steam from the pipe, _c_, forming the shaft of\r\nthe paddle, which is made to revolve by the bevil-wheel. The steams\r\nenters by the elbow-pipe, which has a nozzle ground to fit the head of\r\nthe vertical revolving pipe, upon which it is pressed down by the screw.\r\nWhen the materials have been introduced into the cylinder, the stirrer\r\nis set in motion, and superheated steam is sent down the pipe; the\r\naniline is volatilized and passes with the steam through the pipe, which\r\nis connected with a worm surrounded by cold water. The aniline is\r\npurified by another distillation over lime or soda. When pure, aniline\r\nis a colourless, somewhat oily-looking liquid, of a feeble aromatic\r\nodour. Under the influence of light and air it becomes of a brownish\r\ntint, in which condition it usually presents itself in commerce. It\r\nscarcely dissolves in water, but is readily soluble in alcohol, ether,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 356.—_Section of Hollow Spindle,—Aniline Apparatus._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Perkin who, in 1856, first obtained from aniline a substance\r\npractically available for dyeing. Let it be noticed that when Mr. Perkin\r\ndiscovered _aniline purple_, he was not engaged in searching for\r\ndye-stuffs, but was carrying on a purely scientific investigation as to\r\nthe possibility of artificially preparing quinine. With this view,\r\nhaving selected a substance into the composition of which nitrogen,\r\nhydrogen, and carbon enter in exactly the same proportions as they occur\r\nin quinine, but differing from it by containing no oxygen, he thought it\r\nnot improbable that by oxidizing this body he might obtain quinine. In\r\nthis he was disappointed, for the result was a dirty reddish-brown\r\npowder. Being desirous, however, of understanding more fully the nature\r\nof this reddish powder, he proceeded to try the effects of oxidation on\r\nother similarly constituted but more simple bodies. For this purpose he\r\nfortunately selected _aniline_, which, when treated with sulphuric acid\r\nand bichromate of potash, he found to yield a perfectly black product.\r\nPersevering in his experiments by examining this black substance, he\r\nobtained, by digesting it with spirits of wine, the now well-known\r\n“aniline purple.” Mr. Perkin, having determined to make the aniline\r\npurple on the large scale, patented his process, and succeeded in\r\novercoming the many obstacles incident to the establishment of a new\r\nmanufacture requiring as its raw material products not at that time met\r\nwith as commercial articles. The process is now carried on the large\r\nscale by mixing sulphuric acid and aniline in the proportions in which\r\nthey combine to form the sulphate of aniline, and dissolving by boiling\r\nwith water in a large vat. Bichromate of potash is dissolved in water in\r\nanother large vat. When both solutions are cold, they are mixed together\r\nin a still larger vessel and allowed to stand a day or two. A fine black\r\npowder settles on the bottom of the vessel in large quantities; this is\r\ncollected in filters, washed with water, and dried. This powder is not\r\naniline purple alone, but a mixture of this with other products,\r\npresenting a very unpromising appearance; but when it has been digested\r\nfor some time with diluted methylated spirit, all the colouring matter\r\nis dissolved out, and is obtained from the solution by placing the\r\nlatter in a still, where the spirit is distilled off and collected for\r\nfuture use, while all the colouring matter remains behind, held in\r\nsolution by the water. From this aqueous solution the mauve is thrown\r\ndown by adding caustic soda. It is collected, washed, and drained until\r\nof a pasty consistence, in which condition it is sent into the market.\r\nIt can be obtained in crystals, but the commercial article is seldom\r\nrequired in this form, as the additional expense is not compensated by\r\nany superiority in the practical applications of the colour. Mauve is\r\nreadily soluble in spirits of wine, but not very soluble in water. Its\r\ntinctorial power is so great that _one-tenth of a grain_ suffices to\r\nimpart quite a deep colour to a gallon of water. Silk and woollen\r\nfabrics have an extraordinary attraction for this colouring matter,\r\nwhich attaches itself very firmly to their fibres. If some white wool is\r\ndipped into even a very dilute solution, the colour is quickly absorbed.\r\nMauve is more permanent than any other coal-tar colour, being little\r\naffected by the prolonged action of light.\r\n\r\nMauve is chemically a salt of a base which has been termed “mauveine.”\r\nMauveine itself is a nearly black crystalline powder, which forms\r\nsolutions of a dull blue-violet tint, but when an acid is added to such\r\na solution the tint is at once changed to purple. Mauveine is a powerful\r\nbase, displacing ammonia from its compounds. The commercial crystallized\r\nmauve is the acetate of mauveine.\r\n\r\nThe process by which Mr. Perkin originally obtained mauve from aniline\r\nevidently depends upon the well-known oxidizing property of bichromate\r\nof potash, and experiments were accordingly made with other, oxidizing\r\nbodies and aniline; in fact, patents were taken out for the use of\r\nnearly every known oxidizing chemical. Three years after Mr. Perkin’s\r\ndiscovery of mauve, M. Verguin, of Lyons, obtained, by treating _crude_\r\naniline with chloride of tin, the bright red colouring matter now known\r\nas magenta. It was found also that crude aniline, when treated with\r\nother metallic chlorides, nitrates, or other salts, which are oxidizing\r\nagents less powerful than bichromate of potash, yields this bright red\r\ncolouring matter. A process patented by Medlock, in 1860, in which\r\narsenic acid is the oxidizing agent, has almost entirely superseded, in\r\nEngland at least, all the others yet proposed for the manufacture of\r\nmagenta. It is not a little remarkable that magenta would not have been\r\ndiscovered had M. Verguin and others operated on _pure_ aniline instead\r\nof on the ordinary commercial article. For it was found subsequently by\r\nDr. Hofman that pure aniline cannot be made to yield magenta: the\r\npresence of another body is necessary. A reference to the table of\r\ncoal-tar constituents will show that there is a hydro-carbon named\r\n“toluol.” This substance is of a similar nature to benzol, and has a\r\nboiling-point so little above that of benzol, that in the rough methods\r\nof separation usually employed, a notable quantity of toluol is carried\r\nover with the benzol, and is always present in the commercial article.\r\nIn the processes which benzol undergoes for conversion into aniline, the\r\ntoluol accompanies it in a series of parallel transformations, resulting\r\nin the production of a base termed “toluidine”—similar to aniline—being,\r\nhowever, in its pure state a solid at ordinary temperatures. We write\r\ndown the symbols representing the composition of the bodies formed in\r\nthe two cases in order to clearly show this:\r\n\r\n                    Benzol       C_{6}H_{6}\r\n                    Nitro-benzol C_{6}H_{5}(NO_{2})\r\n                    Aniline      C_{6}H_{5}NH_{2}\r\n                    Toluol       C_{7}H_{8}\r\n                    Nitro-toluol C_{7}H_{7}(NO_{2})\r\n                    Toluidine    C_{7}H_{7}NH_{2}\r\n\r\nThis aniline prepared from commercial benzol always contains some\r\ntoluidine; and it is essential for the production of magenta that this\r\nsubstance should be operated on along with the aniline. Whether the\r\npresence of some toluidine is also necessary for the production of mauve\r\nand other colours is not yet known, but they are always prepared from\r\ncommercial benzol. It is certain that pure aniline yields no magenta,\r\nneither does pure toluidine; but a mixture supplies it in abundance. For\r\nthe preparation of magenta the best proportions for this mixture would\r\nbe about three parts of aniline to one of toluidine; but, in practice,\r\nit is not necessary to obtain the two substances separately, as benzol,\r\nmixed with a sufficient quantity of toluol, may be obtained by\r\nregulating the distillation. The apparatus used in the production of\r\nmagenta is shown in Fig. 352. It consists of a large iron pot set over a\r\nfurnace in brickwork, and having a lid with a stuffing-box, through\r\nwhich passes a spindle carrying a stirrer. A bent tube rises from the\r\nlid, and is connected with a worm surrounded by cold water, for the\r\npurpose of condensing the aniline which is vapourized in the process.\r\nThe aniline, containing a due amount of toluidine, is mixed in this\r\napparatus with about one and a half times its weight of a saturated\r\nsolution of arsenic acid (H_{3}AsO_{4}). The fire is lighted and kept up\r\nfor several hours: water first, and lastly aniline, distil over. When\r\nthe operation is ended, steam is blown through the apparatus, thus\r\ncarrying off an additional portion of aniline. The crude product is then\r\nboiled with water, the solution filtered, and common salt added, which\r\nprecipitates an impure magenta. This is afterwards dissolved and\r\nrecrystallized several times. The crystals of this magenta—like those of\r\nmany of the coal-colour products—have a peculiar greenish metallic\r\nlustre; they dissolve in warm water, forming a deep purplish-red\r\nsolution. The chemical composition of magenta has been investigated by\r\nDr. Hofman, who found it to be a salt of an organic base, to which he\r\ngave the name of “rosaniline.” This rosaniline is easily obtained from\r\nmagenta by addition to its solution of an alkali. While all its salts\r\nare intensely coloured, rosaniline itself is a perfectly colourless\r\nsubstance, becoming reddened by exposure to the air, as it absorbs\r\ncarbonic acid, thus passing to the condition of a salt. Rosaniline,\r\nthen, displays its chromatic powers only when it is combined with an\r\nacid. This property is sometimes shown at lectures in a striking manner\r\nby dipping a piece of paper into a colourless solution of rosaniline,\r\nand exposing it to the air, when, as the rosaniline absorbs carbonic\r\nacid, the paper changes from white to red. A more elegant form of the\r\nsame experiment is to dip a white rose into a solution of rosaniline\r\ncontaining a little ammonia. As the ammonia escapes, or is expelled by a\r\ncurrent of warm air, the same kind of action occurs, and the white rose\r\nchanges to red—as if by magic, the emblem of the House of York is\r\ntransformed into the badge of Lancaster! The chemical nature of\r\nrosaniline is regarded as analogous to that of ammonia—it is, in fact,\r\nlooked upon by chemists as a sort of ammonia, in each particle of which\r\nsome atoms of hydrogen have been replaced by certain _groups_ of carbon\r\nand hydrogen atoms—some of these groups being derived from the aniline\r\nand others from the toluidine. The particular salt of rosaniline which\r\nconstitutes the crude product of the action on the aniline and\r\ntoluidine, depends on the substance employed to effect the oxidation. If\r\na chloride, the resulting product is chloride of rosaniline; if a\r\nnitrate, it is the nitrate; and so on. The magenta which is formed in\r\nthe first instance by the process we have described is an arseniate of\r\nrosaniline; but in the subsequent processes, it is converted into the\r\nchloride—the salt usually sold as magenta. Other salts of rosaniline are\r\nmade on the large scale—especially the acetate, the beautiful crystals\r\nof which have the advantage of being very soluble.\r\n\r\nMagenta attaches itself strongly to animal fibres, but the colour is\r\nsomewhat fugacious under the action of sunlight. It is used not only as\r\na dye, but more largely as the raw material from which a number of other\r\nbeautiful colours are obtained. For this reason it is manufactured on an\r\nenormous scale, thousands of tons being produced annually, and the money\r\nvalue of the colour produced from it must be reckoned by thousands of\r\npounds. Yet aniline was a few years ago merely a curiosity never met\r\nwith out of the laboratory of the scientific chemist. It is stated that\r\na single firm now makes more than twelve tons of aniline weekly, and on\r\nits premises may be seen tanks, in each of which 30,000 gallons of\r\nmagenta solution is depositing its crystals. If a salt of rosaniline be\r\nheated with aniline, the colour changes gradually through purple to\r\nblue, while ammonia is at the same time given off. This is the colour\r\nknown as aniline blue, “bleu du Lyons,” &c. In its preparation it has\r\nbeen found that the best results are obtained by employing the salt of\r\nsome weak acid—acetate of rosaniline, for example—and pure aniline, that\r\nis, aniline free from toluidine. The operation is conducted in iron pots\r\nvery similar to those used in making magenta, but smaller. These pots\r\nare not set over a fire, but a number of them are placed in a large\r\nvessel containing oil, by which they can be maintained at a regulated\r\ntemperature when the oil is heated. The crude product undergoes several\r\npurifications, and the aniline blue is supplied in commerce in powder,\r\nor dissolved in spirits of wine. It is insoluble in water, and this has\r\nbeen an obstacle to its employment; but recently a similar substance has\r\nbeen obtained in a soluble form, and is extensively used for dyeing\r\nwool, under the name of “Nicholson’s blue.” Other blues have been\r\nsimilarly prepared, and from the same two substances, magenta and\r\naniline, a colour known as “violet imperial” was formerly made in very\r\nlarge quantities, but it has been superseded by the colours about to be\r\ndescribed. It may be well to mention that these blues and violets have\r\nbeen found to contain bases formed of rosaniline, in which one, two, or\r\nthree atoms of hydrogen are replaced by the group C_{6}H_{5}. This group\r\nof atoms will be noticed to belong to aniline, and chemists have named\r\nit phenyl, and, therefore, bases of these coloured salts are\r\nrespectively named phenyl-rosaniline, di-phenyl-rosaniline,\r\ntri-phenyl-rosaniline. But Dr. Hofman found that other groups of atoms\r\nbesides C_{6}H_{5} may be made to take the place of H in rosaniline. By\r\nacting on rosaniline or its salts with iodides of ethyl, C_{2}H_{5}I, or\r\niodide of methyl, CH_{3}I, he obtained a beautiful series of violets, of\r\nwhich many shades could be produced, varying from red-purple to blue.\r\nThese are the colours so well known as Hofman’s violets, and are\r\nprepared on the large scale by heating a solution of magenta (chloride\r\nof rosaniline) in alcohol or wood spirit, with the iodide of ethyl or\r\nthe iodide of methyl. The nature and proportions of the ingredients are\r\nregulated according to the tint required. The vessels are hermetically\r\nclosed during the heating, which is accomplished by steam admitted into\r\na steam-jacket surrounding the vessel. The crude product has to be\r\nseparated from the substances with which it is mixed, and the colouring\r\nmatter is finally obtained, presenting in the solid state the peculiar\r\nsemi-metallic lustre so characteristic of these products. Like the other\r\ncolours, Hofman’s violets are salts of _colourless_ bases, which, as\r\nindicated above, are substitution products of rosaniline. The tints they\r\nproduce incline to red, violet, or blue, according as one, two, or three\r\nhydrogen atoms are replaced by the ethyl or methyl groups. Colours have\r\nalso been obtained from mauve and iodide of ethyl—for example, the dye\r\nknown in commerce as “dahlia.” Other colours are procured from magenta\r\nby treating it with various compounds: one such is the “Britannia\r\nviolet,” discovered also by Mr. Perkin, who procures it from magenta and\r\na hydrocarbon-bromide derived from the action of bromine or common\r\nturpentine. This is a very useful colour, and is largely used in dyeing\r\nand printing violets, of which any shades may be obtained.\r\n\r\nAnother derivative of rosaniline is the aniline green. It is obtained by\r\ndissolving the rosaniline salt in dilute sulphuric acid, adding crude\r\n_aldehyde_ (a substance obtained by acting with oxidizing agents on\r\nalcohol). The mixture is heated until a sample dissolves in acidulated\r\nwater with a blue tint; it is poured out into boiling water containing\r\nin solution hyposulphite of sodium, boiled, the liquid filtered; and the\r\ngreen dye, if required in the solid state, is precipitated by carbonate\r\nof sodium. Aniline green dyes wool and silk, the latter especially, of a\r\nmagnificent green; perhaps as beautiful a colour as any of the coal-tar\r\nseries, and one which has the singular advantage among greens of looking\r\nas beautiful in artificial light as in daylight. The manner in which\r\nthis dye was discovered is somewhat curious. It is related by Mr. Perkin\r\nof a dyer, named Chirpin, that he was trying to render permanent a\r\n_blue_ colouring matter, which had been found could be produced from\r\nrosaniline by the action of aldehyde and sulphuric acid. After a number\r\nof fruitless attempts at fixing it, he confided his perplexities to a\r\nphotographic friend, who evidently thought that if it was possible to\r\nfix a photograph, anything else might be fixed in like manner, for he\r\nrecommended his confidant to try hyposulphite of sodium. On making the\r\nexperiment, however, the dyer did not succeed in fixing his blue, but\r\nconverted it into the splendid aldehyde green. Like other colouring\r\nmatters we have described, this is a salt of a colourless base\r\ncontaining sulphur. Like rosaniline, the colourless base takes on the\r\ncharacteristic colour of its salts by merely absorbing carbonic acid\r\nfrom the air.\r\n\r\nAgain, by a modification of the process for producing the Hofman\r\nviolets, another green of an entirely different constitution may be\r\nobtained. It is bluer in tint than the former, and is much used for\r\ncotton and silks, under the name of “iodine green.”\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of magenta there is formed a residuum or bye-product,\r\nconsisting of a resinous, feebly basic substance, from which Nicholson\r\nobtained a dye, imparting to silk and wool a gorgeous golden yellow\r\ncolour. This dye cannot be obtained directly, but is always produced in\r\ngreater or less quantity when magenta is made on the large scale, and is\r\nseparated during the purification. By first dyeing the silk or wool with\r\nmagenta, and then with this dye, which is commercially known as\r\n“phosphine,” brilliant scarlet tints are obtained. The yellow colours\r\nhave been found to be salts of a base termed chrysaniline, a sort of\r\nchemical relative of rosaniline, as may be seen in comparing the formulæ\r\nwhich represent their constitution, with which we place also the symbol\r\nfor another substance obtained by submitting rosaniline to the influence\r\nof nascent hydrogen. This body, _leucaniline_, again yields rosaniline\r\nvery readily when the hydrogen is removed by oxidizing agents. It will\r\nbe noticed that the three bodies form a series the members of which\r\ndiffer only by H_{2}, thus indicating their close relationship.\r\n\r\n                    C_{20}H_{17}N_{3} Chrysaniline.\r\n                    C_{20}H_{19}N_{3} Rosaniline.\r\n                    C_{20}H_{21}N_{3} Leucaniline.\r\n\r\nSome idea will have been obtained from the foregoing particulars of the\r\ngreat colour-supplying capabilities of aniline; but we have not yet\r\nexhausted the utility of this interesting substance. It is probable that\r\nthe letters on the page now under the reader’s eye owe their blackness\r\nto an aniline product. For after all the salts furnishing the lovely\r\ntints we have mentioned have been extracted, there is in their\r\nmanufacture a final residuum, and from this an intense black is\r\nobtained, which is largely used in the manufacture of printing-ink.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned _phenol_ as a substance yielding colours. Phenol is\r\nthe body now so well known as a disinfectant under the name of “carbolic\r\nacid,” a name given to it by its discoverer, Runge, who prepared it from\r\ncoal-tar, in 1834. Phenol forms colourless crystals, which dissolve to\r\nsome extent in water, and very readily in alcohol. It is a powerful\r\nantiseptic, that is, it arrests the process of putrefaction in animal or\r\nvegetable bodies, and it is also highly poisonous. The constitution of\r\nphenol is given by the formula C_{6}H_{5} OH, in which the reader will\r\nrecognize the same group of atoms already indicated as entering into the\r\naniline derivatives. From some of these phenol may in fact be obtained,\r\nand although it cannot be formed _directly_ from benzol, phenol can be\r\nmade to furnish benzol. When crude phenol is treated with a sulphuric\r\nacid and oxalic acid, a substance is obtained which presents itself as a\r\nbrittle resinous mass of a brown colour, with greenish metallic lustre.\r\nThis substance is called _rosolic acid_ by chemists, but in commerce it\r\nis known as _aurine_, and is used for dyeing silk of an orange colour,\r\nwhich, however, is not very permanent. But by heating rosolic acid with\r\nliquid ammonia, a permanent red dye is procured which has been termed\r\n_peonine_, and has been much used for woollen goods. But it lately had\r\nthe reputation of exerting a poisonous action, producing blistering and\r\nsores when stockings or other articles dyed with it were worn in contact\r\nwith the skin. It is now, therefore, less extensively employed.\r\n_Coralline_, another body identical with or very similar to the former,\r\nis similarly prepared from rosolic acid by heating it with ammonia under\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nAgain, by heating coralline with aniline, a blue dye, known as\r\n“azurine,” or “azuline,” was formerly made in large quantities; but it\r\nhas been supplanted by the aniline blues already described.\r\n\r\nWhen phenol is acted upon by nitric acid new compounds are produced,\r\nstanding in the same relation to phenol as nitro-benzol does to benzol.\r\nThe final result of the action of nitric acid on phenol is _picric\r\nacid_, called also “carbazotic acid,” and, more systematically,\r\n“tri-nitro-phenol;” for it is regarded as phenol in which three of the\r\nhydrogen atoms have been replaced by the group NO_{2} thus,\r\nC_{6}H_{2}(NO_{2})_{3} OH. It forms bright yellow-coloured crystals, and\r\nits solution readily imparts a bright pure yellow colour to wool, silk,\r\n&c. It received the name of picric acid (πικρος, _bitter_) from the\r\nexceedingly bitter taste of even an extremely diluted solution. It is\r\nsaid that picric acid is employed as an adulterant in bitter ale instead\r\nof hops. Now, the colouring power of picric acid is so great, that even\r\nthe minute quantity which could be used to impart bitterness to beer is\r\nrecognizable by dipping a piece of white wool into the beer, when, if\r\npicric acid be present, the wool acquires a clear yellow tint. Besides\r\nits employment as a yellow, it is useful for procuring green tints by\r\ncombination with the blues. Picric acid again furnishes, by treatment\r\nwith _cyanide of potassium_, a deep red colour, consisting of an acid\r\nwhich, when combined with ammonia, furnishes a magnificent colouring\r\nmaterial—which is, in fact, _murexide_, a dye identical with the famous\r\nTyrian purple of the ancients, and formerly obtainable only from certain\r\nkinds of shell-fish.\r\n\r\nNaphthaline—another of the colour-yielding substances of coal-tar—is,\r\nlike benzol, a hydro-carbon, but one belonging to quite another chemical\r\nseries. Its formula is C_{10}H_{8}, and it has an interest to chemists\r\naltogether apart from its industrial uses, from having been the subject\r\nof the classic researches of the French chemist, Laurent—researches\r\nwhich resulted in the introduction of new and fertile ideas into\r\nchemical science, contributing largely to its rapid progress.\r\nNaphthaline forms colourless crystals, which, like camphor, slowly\r\nvolatilize at ordinary temperatures, and are readily distilled in a\r\ncurrent of steam. It is thus sufficiently volatile to escape complete\r\ndeposition in the condensers of the gas-works, and to be partly carried\r\nover into the mains, where its collection occasions some trouble. Nitric\r\nacid acts upon naphthaline in a manner analogous to that in which it\r\nacts on benzol, forming nitro-naphthaline, which, in its turn, submitted\r\nto the action of iron filings and acetic acid, is transformed into a\r\nbase called “naphthylamine.” The salts of naphthylamine are coloured\r\nproducts which, in some cases, have been found available as dyes. There\r\nis a crimson colour, and a yellow largely used under the name of\r\n“Manchester yellow,” for imparting to silk and wool a gorgeous golden\r\nyellow colour. Another coloured derivative of naphthaline, called\r\n“carminaphtha,” was discovered by Laurent in the course of his\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to fill this volume with descriptions of the\r\nproperties, and modes of preparing the numerous colouring matters that\r\nhave been obtained from coal-tar products. In order to give the reader\r\nan idea of the extent to which the tar products have been made to\r\nminister to our sense of the beautiful, a list is here given of the\r\nprincipal colouring matters from these sources that have been employed\r\nin the arts. The various names under which a product has been\r\ncommercially known are in most cases given. It must be understood that\r\nthe same name is frequently applied to products chemically distinct, and\r\nsome of the names which appear as synonyms may also in reality indicate\r\ndifferent substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LIST OF COAL-TAR COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\n              I.

The arts of lithography, type-printing,\r\npaper-staining, &c., have also profited by the coal-tar colours. For\r\nsuch purposes the colour is prepared by fixing it on alumina, a process\r\nin which much difficulty was at first experienced, for the colours are\r\nthemselves almost all of a basic nature. The desired result is now\r\nattained by fixing them on the alumina with tannic or benzoic acid.\r\nThese lakes produce brilliant printing-inks, which are extensively used.\r\nThe aniline colours are also employed for coloured writing-inks, tinted\r\nsoaps, imitations of bronzed surfaces, and for a variety of other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago coal-tar was a valueless substance: it was actually\r\ngiven away by gas-makers to any one who chose to fetch it from the\r\nworks. It was then “matter in the wrong place;” but Mr. Perkin’s\r\ndiscovery led to its being put in the right place, and it has become the\r\nraw material of a manufacture creating an absolutely new industry, which\r\nhas developed with amazing rapidity. This industry dates from only 1856,\r\nand in 1862 the annual value of its products was more than £400,000. Dr.\r\nHofman, in reporting on the coal-tar colours shown at the Paris\r\nExhibition of 1867, computed the value at that time at about £1,250,000,\r\nalthough the products were much cheaper than before. Large manufactories\r\nhave been established in Great Britain, in France, Germany, Switzerland,\r\nAmerica, and other countries. The possibility of such an industry is an\r\ninteresting illustration of the manner in which the progress made in any\r\none branch of practical science may lead to unexpected developments in\r\nother quarters. The quantity of aniline obtained from coal-tar is very\r\nsmall compared to the amount of coal used, as may be seen from the\r\nfollowing table, in which the respective weights of the various products\r\nrequired in the manufacture of _mauve_ are arranged as given by Mr.\r\nPerkin for the produce of 100 lbs. of coal.\r\n\r\n                                        lbs. oz.\r\n                       Coal              100  0\r\n                       Coal-tar           10 12\r\n                       Coal-tar naphtha    0  8½\r\n                       Benzol              0  2¾\r\n                       Nitro-benzol        0  4¼\r\n                       Aniline             0  2¼\r\n                       Mauve               0  0¼\r\n\r\nFrom this we may perceive that had not the manufacture of gas been\r\ngreatly extended, so as to yield a large aggregate produce of tar, the\r\nrequisite supply for the manufacture of aniline would not have been\r\nattainable; and the industrial application of the previously worthless\r\nbye-product reacts upon gas manufacture by cheapening the price of that\r\ncommodity, thus tending still more to extend its use.\r\n\r\nAlthough anthracene has already been named as one of the\r\ncolour-producing substances found in coal-tar, we have not in the list\r\nof coal-tar colours included the colouring matter which anthracene is\r\ncapable of yielding. The reason is that this case stands apart in some\r\nrespects from the rest. The colours derived from aniline and the other\r\nsubstances already enumerated are instances of the production of bodies\r\nnot found in nature—mauve, magenta, &c., do not, so far as we know,\r\nexist in nature. Their artificial formation was a production of\r\nsubstances absolutely new. The colour of which we have now to treat is,\r\non the other hand, found in nature, and from its occurrence in the\r\n_rubia tinctoria_, the roots of that plant have for ages been employed\r\nas a source of colour, and are well known in this country as “madder.”\r\nThe plant is grown largely in Holland, in France, in the Levant, and in\r\nthe south of Russia.[18] Madder is used in enormous quantities for\r\ndyeing reds and purples: the well-known “Turkey red” is due to the\r\ncolouring matter of this root. The total annual value of the madder\r\ngrown is calculated to reach nearly 2½ million pounds sterling. More\r\nthan forty years ago it was discovered that the madder-root yielded a\r\ncolouring substance, to which the name of “alizarine” was bestowed, from\r\n_alizari_, the commercial designation of madder in the Levant. The\r\nalizarine does not exist in the fresh root, but is produced in the\r\nordinary processes of preparing the root and dyeing with it, in\r\nconsequence of a peculiar decomposition or fermentation. Alizarine may\r\nbe procured from dried madder by simply submitting it to sublimation,\r\nwhen beautiful orange needle-shaped crystals of alizarine may be\r\nobtained. It is nearly insoluble in water, but readily dissolves in hot\r\nspirits of wine. Acids do not dissolve it, but potash dissolves it\r\nfreely, striking a beautiful colour; with lime, barytes, and oxide of\r\niron, it forms purple lake, and with alumina a beautiful red lake.\r\nAccording to Dr. Schunck, of Manchester, to whose investigations we are\r\nindebted for much of our knowledge of madder, the root contains a bitter\r\nuncrystallizable substance called “rubian,” which, under the action of\r\ncertain ferments, and of acids and alkalies, is decomposed into a kind\r\nof sugar, and into alizarine and other colouring matters. The ferment,\r\nwhich in the process of extracting the colouring matter from the roots\r\ncauses the formation of alizarine, is contained in the root itself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  The natural Order to which the madder plant belongs is interesting\r\n  from the number of its members which supply us with useful products.\r\n  That valuable medicine, quinine, is obtained from plants belonging to\r\n  this family, as is also ipecacuanha, and other articles of the\r\n  _materia medica_. _Coffea arabica_, which furnishes the coffee-berry,\r\n  is another member.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how an investigation relating to a question of pure\r\nchemical science accidentally led Mr. Perkin to the discovery of\r\nmauve—the precursor of the long range of beautiful colours already\r\ndescribed. The mode of artificially preparing alizarine, so far from\r\nbeing an accidental discovery, was sought for and found in 1869 by two\r\nGerman chemists, Graebe and Liebermann. The researches of these chemists\r\nwere conducted in a highly scientific spirit. Instead of making attempts\r\nto produce alizarine by trying various processes on first one body, then\r\nanother, to see if they could hit upon some tar product, or other\r\nsubstance, which would yield the desired product, they began by\r\noperating analytically on alizarine itself. Just as a mechanic ignorant\r\nof horology, required to make a watch, would be more likely quickly to\r\nsucceed in his task by taking a watch to pieces to see how it is put\r\ntogether, than if he had tried all manner of arranging springs and\r\nwheels until he hit upon the right way; so these chemists set themselves\r\nto take alizarine to pieces, in order to see from what materials they\r\nmight be able to put it together. They decomposed alizarine, and among\r\nthe products found a hydro-carbon identical in all its properties with\r\n_anthracene_.\r\n\r\nAnthracene was discovered in coal-tar by Laurent in 1832, and its\r\nproperties were investigated by Anderson in 1862. It may be remarked\r\nthat such investigations were not conducted with a view to any\r\nindustrial uses of anthracene, but merely for the sake of chemistry as a\r\nscience. Certainly no one could have supposed at that time that the\r\nslightest relation existed between anthracene and madder. Anthracene is\r\na white solid hydro-carbon, which comes over only in the last stages of\r\nthe distillation of coal-tar, accompanied by naphthaline, from which it\r\nis easily separated by means of spirits of wine, by which the\r\nnaphthaline is readily dissolved, but the anthracene scarcely. Anderson,\r\nin 1861, discovered, among other results, that anthracene, C_{14}H_{10},\r\nby treatment with nitric acid became changed into oxy-anthracene,\r\nC_{14}H_{8}O_{2}; and this reaction we shall see is a step in the\r\nprocess of procuring alizarine from anthracene. Phenol, as already\r\nmentioned, can be made to yield benzol, by a process of deoxidization.\r\nWith a view to similarly obtaining a hydro-carbon from alizarine, Graebe\r\nand Liebermann passed its vapours over heated zinc filings, and thus\r\nproduced anthracene from alizarine. It now remained to find a means of\r\nreversing this process, that is, so to act on anthracene as to produce\r\nalizarine, and this was effected by treating anthracene with bromine,\r\nforming a substance which, on fusing with caustic potash, yielded\r\n_alizarate of potash_, from which pure alizarine resulted by treatment\r\nwith hydrochloric acid. A much cheaper method was, however, necessary\r\nfor manufacturing purposes, and it was found in a process by which\r\noxy-anthracene, C_{14}O_{8}H_{2}, is treated at a high temperature with\r\nstrong sulphuric acid, and the product so formed heated with a strong\r\nsolution of potash, yielding alizarate of potassium as before. Many\r\nother interesting substances appear to be formed in the reactions, but\r\nthe nature of these bodies has as yet been imperfectly investigated. No\r\ndoubt whatever can be entertained of the identity of natural with\r\nartificial alizarine; and the production of this substance, the first\r\ninstance of a natural colouring matter made artificially, may be\r\nregarded as a great triumph of chemical science. It was not long ago\r\nsupposed that the chemical bodies found in plants or animals, or\r\nproduced by vital actions, could not possibly be formed by any\r\nartificial process from their elements. The laws which presided at their\r\nformation were, it was conceived, wholly different from those which\r\ngoverned the chemicals of the laboratory, for they were held to act\r\nexclusively under the influence of a mysterious agent, namely, “vital\r\nforce.” It was supposed, for example, that from pure carbon, oxygen, and\r\nhydrogen, no chemist would ever be able to produce such a compound as\r\nacetic acid. Accordingly the domain of chemical science, previous to the\r\nend of the first quarter of the present century, was divided by an\r\nimpassable barrier into the two regions of organic and inorganic\r\nchemistry. Now, however, the chemist is able to build up in his\r\nlaboratory from their very elements a great number of the so-called\r\n_organic_ bodies. And it is quite possible to do this in the case of\r\nalizarine; that is, a chemist having in his laboratory the elements,\r\nhydrogen, carbon, oxygen, &c., could actually build up the substance\r\nwhich gives its value to madder.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of anthracene procurable from coal-tar is, unfortunately,\r\ncomparatively small, for it is found that from the distillation of 2,000\r\ntons of coal only one ton of anthracene can be obtained. The use of\r\nartificial alizarine would doubtless entirely supplant the employment of\r\nmadder-root if anthracene could be obtained in larger quantities; and\r\nthe change would be highly advantageous to this country, for as no\r\nmadder is grown in Great Britain, and we consume nearly half the whole\r\nannual growth, it follows that every year a million pounds sterling go\r\nout of the country for this commodity. When anthracene is produced from\r\ncoal in sufficient abundance, this sum will be available for the support\r\nof our own population. In the meantime, the manufacture of artificial\r\nalizarine is restricted only by the supply of its raw material.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing paragraphs of the present article, which were written for\r\nthe first edition of this work, not long after the introduction of\r\nartificial alizarine, require some supplementary reference to the\r\nsubsequent progress of discovery and to the increased importance of the\r\nmanufacture of the coal-tar colours on the large scale. Since the first\r\nintroduction of alizarine as a commercial product, the substance has\r\nreceived much attention from chemists. The constitution of the body\r\ncalled above _oxy-anthracene_ is now better understood, and its chemical\r\nrelationship is more clearly indicated by the systematic name of\r\n_anthraquinone_, which it now bears. The process of the manufacture of\r\nalizarine has received some advantageous modifications, and the\r\nartificial product may now be said to have entirely displaced the\r\nmadder-root in dyeing. But, more than this, chemists have found means of\r\npreparing a number of “derivatives” of alizarine, many of which are\r\neither colouring matters or are easily converted into such. Nearly\r\nthirty of these substances have been described, and several of them have\r\nfound extensive industrial applications. We may mention _alizarine\r\nblue_, C_{17} H_{9} NO_{4}, and another substance, produced by combining\r\nthat with _sodium bi-sulphite_, and having the formula C_{17} H_{9}\r\nNO_{4} 2Na H SO_{3}. This last, manufactured largely, and sold under the\r\nname of “_alizarine blue S._,” is remarkable for being one of the most\r\npermanent of all colouring matters. It is said to be a faster colour\r\nthan even indigo blue, which, indeed, it is rapidly replacing in dyeing,\r\nwhere it is applicable to cotton with a chromium mordant and to silk\r\nwith one of alumina. Two other colouring matters have also been derived\r\nfrom anthracene, and are much used in dyeing; one is commercially named\r\n_anthracene purple_, the other is _anthracene green_, which supplies the\r\ncalico printer with very fast shades of olive-green.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the substances enumerated in the list of coal-tar colours, in\r\npages 689 and 690, are now but little used, or altogether abandoned in\r\ndyeing and calico printing, because either their beautiful hues prove\r\ntoo fugitive, or other bodies of the same class can be produced at a\r\nmuch cheaper rate. The range of choice is now of the amplest, for\r\nchemical discovery has been wonderfully active, but in many cases the\r\nreal nature and relationship of the artificial colouring matters\r\nenumerated above have only quite recently been made out. Mauve (now\r\ncalled _rosaline_), for example, the oldest of all the colour-tar\r\ncolours, and one which, as we have seen, was manufactured on an\r\nextensive scale many years ago, is now scarcely made at all, because\r\nmuch cheaper violets have taken its place. The science of the tinctorial\r\nsubstances has lately taken a much more distinct form, and this\r\nknowledge has borne fruit for industrial purposes. It would be out of\r\nplace here to review what has been done in this way, but a few facts\r\nwill show the richness of the field. It was only in 1886 that the true\r\nchemical constitution of a class of coal-tar derivatives, called\r\n_azines_, was first made out. They present themselves as pale yellow or\r\norange coloured crystallized solids, which melt at a comparatively high\r\ntemperature and may be distilled without decomposition. Although highly\r\ncoloured substances themselves, before they are converted into fast dyes\r\nthey require further treatment, which introduces into their molecules\r\nanother group of atoms. An almost indefinite number of such compounds\r\nare theoretically possible, but from only a very few of them many useful\r\ndye stuffs are now prepared on the large scale. Amongst the most\r\nimportant of these are “neutral red,” “neutral violet,” and two other\r\nviolet colouring matters, “red dyestuff,” “fuchsia,” “giroflé,” “Magdala\r\nred,” “indazine” and “Basle blue.”\r\n\r\nAmong the colouring matters before enumerated are “aniline yellow” and\r\n“Bismarck brown.” Their real nature was not understood until a few years\r\nago; and though the use of the aniline yellow itself has been abandoned\r\non account of its fugacity, the substance has been found a most prolific\r\nparent, which has supplied dye stuffs of the most diverse and brilliant\r\nhues. These form what chemists term the _azo colours_, and they have\r\nbeen manufactured in great variety and on a very large scale. In 1876,\r\nthe class of them called _chrysoidines_ was introduced, and again, in\r\n1878, _tropœolines_. Great numbers of different azo colours have been\r\nsent into commerce under various names, such as “butter yellow,”\r\n“_crocein scarlet_,” “_Biebrich scarlet_,” “_Congo red_,” “_Bordeaux\r\nG._,” “fast red,” &c., &c. About 140 of these azo dyes have been\r\ndescribed, and the commercial importance of this one class of compounds\r\nalone may be inferred from the fact of no fewer than 200 patents having\r\nbeen taken out for processes relating to their manufacture in the eleven\r\nyears from 1878 to 1888.\r\n\r\nIt would not be difficult to fill this book with instances of the way in\r\nwhich the resources of modern life have been increased by chemistry\r\nalone, a science almost entirely the creation of the present century.\r\nMany of the processes of manufacture in which chemistry is applied to\r\nthe production of articles of every-day use have been so often\r\ndescribed, that they may be assumed to be already so well known as to\r\noffer few elements of novelty to the general reader, whose interest\r\nwould also be likely to flag if he were carried over a long range of\r\neven the brilliant discoveries that are so delightful and instructive\r\nfor the special students of this science. There is no parallel to the\r\nrapidity of the progress made by the younger branch of the science which\r\nconcerns itself with the chemistry of one element—namely, carbon and its\r\nvarious combinations, and it is from these carbon compounds that our\r\nexamples have been drawn. In the explosives, we have some of these\r\ncompounds supplying resistless forces for rending rocks, and furnishing\r\nin warfare the most dreadful powers of destruction. In anæsthetics, we\r\nsee beneficent applications of others in alleviating suffering and\r\nannulling pain; and again we have just shown how richly another set of\r\nthem can minister to our sense of beauty. The discussion of these topics\r\nhas afforded an opportunity for bringing before the reader some of the\r\nlaws or summarized statements of experimental facts, and also some of\r\nthose symbolical conceptions of the constitution of compounds, which\r\ntogether furnish the clues that guide the chemist through the vast\r\nlabyrinth of the endless transformations of matter. The results attained\r\nshow that the notions expressed by such words as _atom_, _molecule_,\r\n_compound radical_, _structural formula_, etc., have a true\r\nrepresentative correspondence with something in the actual constitution\r\nof bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 357.—_James Prescott Joule, F.R.S._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE GREATEST DISCOVERY OF THE AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe indulgent reader who may have followed the course of the foregoing\r\npages, will perhaps peruse the title of this article with some little\r\nbewilderment. His attention has been drawn to one after another of a\r\nseries of remarkable and important discoveries, and he will naturally\r\nwonder what can be the discovery which is greater than any of these.\r\nNow, a discovery is great in proportion to the extent and importance of\r\nthe results that flow from it. These results may be immediate and\r\npractical, as in the case of vaccination; or they may be scientific and\r\nintellectual, as in Newton’s discovery of the identity of the force\r\nwhich draws a stone to the ground with that which holds the planets in\r\ntheir orbits. Such discoveries as most enlarge our knowledge of the\r\nworld in which we live, by embracing in simple laws a vast field of\r\nphenomena, are precisely those which are most prolific in useful\r\napplications. If we admit, as we must, the truth of Bacon’s aphorism,\r\nwhich declares that “Man, as the minister and interpreter of nature, is\r\nlimited in act and understanding by his observation of the order of\r\nnature; neither his understanding nor his power extends farther,”[19]\r\nthen it would be easy to show that the discovery of which we have to\r\ntreat, more than any other, must be of immense practical service to\r\nmankind in every one of the ways in which a knowledge of the order of\r\nnature can be of use, viz.:—“First, In showing in how to avoid\r\nattempting impossibilities. Second, In securing us from important\r\nmistakes in attempting what is, in itself, possible, by means either\r\ninadequate or actually opposed to the end in view. Third, In enabling us\r\nto accomplish our ends in the easiest, shortest, most economical, and\r\nmost effectual manner. Fourth, In inducing us to attempt, and enabling\r\nus to accomplish, objects which, but for such knowledge, we should never\r\nhave thought of undertaking.”[20]\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  “Homo naturæ minister et interpres, tantum facit et intelligit quantum\r\n  de naturæ ordine re vel mente observaverit: nec amplius scit aut\r\n  potest.”—_Novum Organum, Aphor._ I.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Sir J. Herschel.\r\n\r\nA great principle, like that which we are about to explain to the\r\nreader, is too vast in its bearings for its discovery and elaboration to\r\nhave been the work of an individual. This truth, and indeed the whole of\r\nour knowledge, is but the result of the development and growth of\r\npre-existing knowledge. In fact, every discovery, however\r\nbrilliant—every invention, however ingenious, is but the expansion or\r\nimprovement of an antecedent discovery or invention. In strictness,\r\ntherefore, it is impossible to say where the first germ of even our\r\nnewest notions may be found. Our latest philosophy can be shown to be\r\nthe result of progressive modifications of ideas of remote ages. Hence\r\nevery great truth, every grand invention, has in reality been the\r\noffspring of many minds; but we record as _the_ discoverers and\r\ninventors those men who have made the longest strides in the path of\r\nprogress, and whose genius and labours have overcome obstacles defying\r\nordinary efforts.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the field which is covered by the principle we have in\r\nview is so vast—embracing, as it does, the whole phenomena of the\r\nuniverse—that it will not be possible to do more within our limits than\r\ngive the reader a general notion of the principle itself. It may be\r\nuseful to instance a truth which has a similar generality and\r\nsignificance, and which has also acquired the force of an axiom, because\r\nit is verified every hour. It is that greatest generalization of\r\nchemistry, affirming that in all its transformations _matter is\r\nindestructible_, and can no more be destroyed than it can be called into\r\nbeing at will. This truth is so well established, that some philosophers\r\nhave asserted that an opposite state of things is _inconceivable_. But\r\nit was not always known; and there are at the present day untutored\r\nminds which not only believe that a substance destroyed by fire is\r\nutterly annihilated, but what they find _inconceivable_ is the continued\r\nexistence of the substance in an invisible form. The candle burns away,\r\nits matter vanishes from our view; but if we collect the invisible\r\nproducts of the combustion, we find in them the whole substance of the\r\ncandle in union with the atmospheric oxygen. We may, in imagination,\r\nfollow the indestructible atoms of carbon in their migrations, from the\r\natmosphere to the plant, which is eaten by the animal and goes to form\r\nits fat, and from the tallow, by combustion, back into the atmosphere\r\nagain. The notion of the real identity of matter under changing forms\r\nhas been expressed by our great dramatist in a well-known passage, which\r\nis remarkable for its philosophic insight, when we consider the age in\r\nwhich it was written:\r\n\r\n    HAMLET. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not\r\n    imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it\r\n    stopping a bung-hole?\r\n\r\n    HORATIO. ‘Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.\r\n\r\n    HAMLET. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with\r\n    modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it. As thus: Alexander\r\n    died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust\r\n    is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he\r\n    was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?\r\n\r\n             Imperial Cæsar, dead, and turned to clay,\r\n             Might stop a hole to keep the wind away;\r\n             O, that the earth, which kept the world in awe,\r\n             Should patch a wall to expel the winter’s flaw!\r\n\r\nNow the greatest discovery of our age is that force, like matter, is\r\nindestructible, and that it can no more be created than can matter. The\r\nreader may perhaps think the statement that we cannot create force is in\r\ncontradiction to experience. He will be disposed to ask, What is the\r\nsteam engine for but to create force? Do we not gain force by the\r\npulley, the lever, the hydraulic press? And are not tremendous forces\r\nproduced when we explode gunpowder or nitro-glycerine? When the\r\nprinciple with which we are here concerned has been developed and stated\r\nin accurate terms, it is hoped the reader will see the real nature of\r\nthese contrivances. We are, however, aware that it is quite impossible\r\nwithin the limits of a short article to do much more than indicate a\r\nregion of discovery abounding with results which may be yet unfamiliar\r\nto some. Into this, if so minded, they should seek for further guidance,\r\nwhich they will pleasantly find in the pages of Dr. Tyndall’s “Heat\r\nconsidered as a Mode of Motion,” and in a little work by Professor\r\nBalfour Stewart, entitled “The Conservation of Energy,” and quite\r\nfascinating from the clearness and simplicity of its style. We may\r\ncontinue our humble task of merely illustrating the general nature of\r\nthis, in reality the most important, subject which we have had occasion\r\nto bring under the reader’s notice.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first step should be to point out the fact of the various\r\nforces of nature—mechanical action, heat, light, electricity, magnetism,\r\nchemical action—being so related that any one can be made to produce all\r\nthe rest directly or indirectly. Some examples of the conversion of one\r\nform of force into another occur in the foregoing pages. Thus, on page\r\n485 an experiment is described in which electricity produces a\r\nmechanical action; electricity is also shown, on page 496, to produce\r\nheat; on page 491 chemical action; on page 501 magnetism. Then, as\r\ninstances of the inverse actions, there is on page 488, in the first\r\nparagraph on “Electric Induction,” an account of the mode in which\r\nmechanical movements may give rise to electricity; and in the\r\nexperiments in pages 508, 509, and particularly in the account of the\r\nGramme machine, page 511, it is shown how mechanical movements can,\r\nthrough magnetism, produce electricity. The voltaic element, page 491,\r\nand the galvanic batteries, are instances of chemical action supplying\r\nelectricity. On page 518 a striking instance is mentioned of changes in\r\nthe forms of force. Every lighted candle is a case of chemical action\r\ngiving rise to light; and interesting examples of the inverse relation\r\nare referred to on page 608. On page 168 is represented the conversion\r\nof arrested motion into heat and light. We have, indeed, sufficient\r\nexamples to arrange a series of these conversions of forces in a circle.\r\nThus, chemical action (oxidation in the animal system) supplies muscular\r\npower, this sets in motion a Gramme machine, the motion is converted\r\ninto electricity, the electricity produces the electric light, and light\r\ncauses chemical action, and with this the cycle is complete. In the\r\nsteam engine heat is converted into mechanical force, and many cases\r\nwill present themselves to the reader’s mind in which mechanical actions\r\ngive rise to heat. The doctrine of a mutual dependence and\r\nconvertibility among all the forms of force was first definitively\r\ntaught in England by Mr. (now Justice) Grove, in 1842; and almost\r\nsimultaneously Dr. Meyer promulgated similar views in Germany. Mr. Grove\r\nsubsequently embodied his doctrine in a treatise, called “The\r\nCorrelation of the Physical Forces,” which has seen several editions.\r\n\r\nBut this teaching included much more than a mere connection between the\r\nvarious forces, for it extended to quantitative relations. It declared\r\nthat a given amount of one force always produced a definite amount of\r\nanother, that a certain quantity of heat, for example, would give rise\r\nto a certain amount of mechanical action, and that this amount of\r\nmechanical action was the _equivalent of the heat_ which produced it,\r\nand would in its turn reproduce all that heat. These last doctrines,\r\nhowever, rested on a speculative basis, until Mr. James Prescott Joule,\r\nof Manchester, carried out a most patient, laborious, and elaborate\r\nexperimental investigation of the subject. His labours placed the truth\r\nof the numerical equivalence of forces on a foundation which cannot be\r\nshaken; and he accomplished for the principle of the indestructibility\r\nof force what Lavoisier did for that of the indestructibility of\r\nmatter—he established it on the incontrovertible basis of accurate and\r\nconclusive experiment. His determination of the value of the _mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat_ especially is a model of experimental research; and\r\nsubsequent investigators have, by diversified methods, confirmed the\r\naccuracy of his results. A great part of his work consisted in finding\r\nwhat quantity of heat would be produced by a given quantity of _work_.\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to give an indication of one of Dr. Joule’s methods of\r\nmaking this determination, we may point out that if a weight be raised a\r\ncertain height, the work which is done in raising it will be given out\r\nby the weight in its descent. If you carry a 1 lb. weight to the top of\r\nthe London Monument, which is 200 ft. high, you perform 200 units of\r\nwork. When the weight is at the top, the work is not lost; for let the\r\nweight be attached to a cord passing over a pulley, and it will, as it\r\ndescends, draw up to the top another 1 lb. weight.[21] If you drop the\r\nweight so that it falls freely, it descends with a continually\r\nincreasing velocity, strikes the pavement, and comes to rest. Still your\r\nwork is not lost. The collision of the weight and the pavement develops\r\n_heat_, just as in the case of the experiment depicted on page 168, but\r\nto a less degree—the increase of temperature might not be sensible to\r\nthe touch, but could be recognized by delicate instruments. Your work,\r\nthen, has now changed into the form of heat—the weight and the pavement\r\nare hotter than before. This heat is carried off by contiguous\r\nsubstances. But still your work is not lost, for it has made the earth\r\nwarmer. The heat, however, soon flows away by radiation from the earth,\r\nand is diffused into space. The final result of your work is, then, that\r\na certain _measurable_ quantity of heat has been sent off into space. Is\r\nyour work now finally lost? Not so: in reality, it is only diffused\r\nthroughout the universe in the form of radiant heat of low intensity.\r\nYet it is lost for ever for useful purposes; for from this final form of\r\ndiffused heat there is no known or conceivable process by which heat can\r\nbe gathered up again.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  See Note B, at the end.\r\n\r\nDr. Joule arranged paddles of brass or iron, so that they could turn\r\nfreely in a circular box containing water or quicksilver. From the sides\r\nof the box partitions projected inwards, which contained openings that\r\npermitted the divided arms of the paddle to pass, and preventing the\r\nliquid from moving _en masse_, thus caused a churning action when the\r\npaddle was turned. Now, every one who has worked a rotatory churn knows\r\nthat a considerable resistance is offered to this action; but every one\r\ndoes not know that under these circumstances the liquid becomes warmer.\r\nIt was Dr. Joule’s object to discover how much the temperature of his\r\nliquid was raised by a measured quantity of work. He used very delicate\r\nthermometers, and had to take a number of precautions which need not\r\nhere be described; and he obtained the definite quantity of work by the\r\ndescent of a known weight through a known distance, a cord attached to\r\nthe weight being wound on a drum, which communicated motion to the\r\npaddle. The experiments were conducted with varying circumstances, to\r\navoid chances of error, and were repeated very many times until uniform\r\nand consistent indications were always obtained. The result of the\r\nexperiments showed that 772 units of work (foot-pounds) furnished heat\r\nwhich would raise the temperature of 1 lb. of water from 32° to 33° F.,\r\nwhich is the unit of heat. This number, 772, is a constant of the\r\ngreatest importance in scientific and practical calculations, and is\r\ncalled “_the mechanical equivalent of heat_.” The amount of _work_ it\r\nrepresents is sometimes called a “Joule,” and is always represented in\r\nalgebraical formulæ by “J.” Mr. Joule’s first paper appeared in 1843,\r\nand soon afterwards various branches of the subject of “The Equivalence\r\nand Persistence of Forces” were taken up by a number of able men, who\r\nhave advanced its principles along various lines of inquiry. Among the\r\nmost noted contributors to this question we find the names of Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson, Helmholtz, James Thomson, Rankin, Clausius, Tait,\r\nAndrews, and Maxwell.\r\n\r\nIn the steam engine the case is the inverse of that presented by the\r\nabove-named experiment of Dr. Joule’s. Here we have heat producing work.\r\nNow, the quantity of steam which enters the cylinder of a steam engine\r\nmay be found, and the temperature of the steam can be determined, and\r\nfrom these the amount of _heat_ which passes into the cylinder per\r\nminute, say, can be calculated. A large portion of this heat is, in an\r\nordinary engine, yielded up to the condensing water, and another part is\r\nlost by conduction and radiation from the cylinder, condenser, pipes,\r\n&c. But both these quantities can be estimated. When the amount is\r\ncompared with that entering the cylinder in the steam, a difference is\r\nalways found, which leaves a quantity of heat unaccounted for. When this\r\nquantity is compared with the _work_ done by the engine in the same\r\ninterval (which work can be measured as described on page 10), it is\r\nalways found that for every 772 units of work a unit of heat has\r\ndisappeared from the cylinder. The numerical relation between work and\r\nheat which is established in these two cases has been tested in many\r\nquite different ways; and, within the limits of experimental errors,\r\nalways with the same numerical result. But equally definite quantitative\r\nrelations are known to exist among all the other forms of force; and the\r\nmanner in which these are convertible into each other has already been\r\nindicated, although want of space prevents full illustration of this\r\npart of the subject. It may, however, be seen that each form of force\r\ncan be mediately or immediately converted into mechanical effect, hence\r\neach is expressible in terms of work. That is to say, we can assign to a\r\nunit of electricity, for example, a number expressing the work which it\r\nwould do if entirely converted into work; and the same number also\r\nexpresses the work which would be required to produce the unit of\r\nelectricity. An ounce of hydrogen in combining with 8 oz. of oxygen\r\nproduces a certain measurable quantity of heat. If that heat, say = H,\r\nwere all converted into work, we now know that the work would = HJ.\r\nHence we can express a definite chemical action in terms of _work_. The\r\nsame is generally true of all physical forces, though in some cases,\r\nsuch as light, vital action, &c., the quantitative relations have not\r\nyet been definitely determined.\r\n\r\nSince, then, all the forces with which we are acquainted are expressible\r\n(though the exact relations of some have yet to be discovered) in terms\r\nof work, it is found of great advantage to consider the power of doing\r\nwork as the common measure of doing all these. Thus, if we define\r\n_energy_ as that which does, or that which is capable of doing, work, we\r\nhave a term extremely convenient in the description of some aspects of\r\nour subject. Thus we can now speak of the _energies of nature_, instead\r\nof the _forces_. And all forces, active or passive, may be summed up in\r\none word—_energy_. And, further, the great discovery of the conservation\r\nof forces under definite equivalents, may be summed up very briefly in\r\nthis statement—THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN THE UNIVERSE IS CONSTANT. To make\r\nthis statement clear requires that a distinction between two forms of\r\nevery kind of energy be pointed out. To recur to the example before\r\nimagined: if you carry the 1 lb. weight up the Monument, and deposit it\r\non the ledge at the top, it might lie there for a thousand years before\r\nit was made to give back the work you had performed upon it. That work\r\nhas been, in a manner, _stored up_ by the _position_ you have given to\r\nyour weight. Now, in taking up the weight, you expended energy—you\r\nreally performed work: that is an instance of energy in operation, and\r\nmay be termed “actual energy.” In what form does the energy exist during\r\nthe thousand years we may suppose your weight to lie at the top of the\r\nMonument? It is ready to yield up your work again at any moment it is\r\npermitted to descend, and it possesses therefore during the whole period\r\na _potential energy_ equal in amount to the _actual energy_ you bestowed\r\nupon it. A similar distinction between actual and potential energy\r\nexists with regard to every form of force. If by any means you separate\r\nan atom of carbon from an atom of oxygen, you exert actual energy. The\r\nprocess is analogous to carrying up the weight. The atoms when separated\r\npossess _potential_ energy,—they can rush together again, like the\r\nweight to the earth, and in doing so will give out the work which was\r\nexpended on their separation. A parallel illustration might be drawn\r\nfrom electrical force.\r\n\r\nA typical example of the storing up of energy is furnished by a\r\ncrossbow. The moment a man begins to bend the bow he is doing work,\r\nbecause he pulls the string in opposition to the bow’s resistance to a\r\nchange in its form; and it is plain that the amount of energy thus\r\nexpended is measurable. Suppose, now, the bow has been bent and the\r\nstring caught in the notch, from which it is released by drawing the\r\ntrigger when the discharge of the bow is desired. The bow may be\r\nretained for an indefinite period in the bent condition, and in this\r\nstate it possesses, in the form of _potential energy_, all the work\r\nwhich has been expended in bending it, and which it will, in fact, give\r\nout, in some way or other, whenever the trigger is drawn. To fix our\r\nideas, let us suppose that to draw the string over the notch required a\r\npull of 50 lbs. over a space of 6 in.; that is equivalent to 50 × ½ = 25\r\nunits of work. Now let the bow be used to shoot an arrow weighing ¼ lb.\r\nvertically upwards. The height in feet to which the arrow will rise\r\nmultiplied into its weight in pounds will be the work done upon it by\r\nthe bow. Now, we say that experiment proves that in the case supposed\r\nthe arrow would rise just 100 ft., so that the work done _by_ the bow (¼\r\n× 100 = 25) would be precisely that done _upon it_. For the sake of\r\nsimplicity, we keep this illustration free from the mention of\r\ninterfering causes, which have to be considered and allowed for when the\r\nmatter is put to the real test of quantitative experiment. The instance\r\nof the crossbow brings into notice a highly instructive circumstance,\r\nwhich is this: the bow, which it may have taken the strength of a\r\nHercules to bend, will shoot its bolt by the mere touch of a child on\r\nthe trigger. In the same way, when a man fires a gun, he merely permits\r\nthe _potential_ energy contained in the charge to convert itself into\r\n_actual_, or _kinetic_, energy. The real source of the energy, in the\r\ncase of the child discharging the crossbow, is the muscular power of the\r\nman who drew it; the real source of the energy in exploding gunpowder is\r\nthe separation of carbon atoms from oxygen atoms, and that has been done\r\nby the sun’s rays, as truly as the string was pulled away from the bow\r\nby muscular power. If we turn our attention to nitro-glycerine or to\r\nnitro-cellulose, we can, by following the chemical actions giving rise\r\nto these substances, in like manner trace their energies to our great\r\nluminary. The unstable union by which oxygen and nitrogen atoms are\r\nlocked up in the solid and liquid forms of nitro-cellulose and\r\nnitro-glycerine is also the work of the sun; for nitrogen acids, or\r\nrather nitrates, are produced naturally under certain electrical and\r\nother conditions of the atmosphere, which are due, directly or\r\nindirectly, to the sun’s action; and they cannot be formed artificially,\r\nexcept by imitating the natural conditions, as by passing electric\r\nsparks through air, &c.\r\n\r\nIt will now be understood, as regards the wonderful relations between\r\nanimal and vegetable life, which have already been alluded to more than\r\nonce, how the sun, by expending actual energy, separates atoms of carbon\r\nfrom atoms of oxygen in the leaves of plants, and confers upon these a\r\nposition of advantage, _i.e._, potential energy; and how animals,\r\nabsorbing the separated carbon in the form of food, and inhaling the\r\nseparated oxygen in the air they breathe, cause the conversion of the\r\npotential into actual energy, which appears in the heat, movements, and\r\nvital functions of the animal body. In coal we have the energy which\r\nplants absorbed from the sun ages ago, stored up in a potential form.\r\nThe carbon atoms are ready to rush into union with oxygen atoms, and\r\nconvert their energy of position into the energies developed by chemical\r\naction, viz., heat, light, &c. Energy is thus constantly shifting its\r\nform from actual to potential, and _vice versâ_, and exhibiting itself\r\nunder the various transformations of force, as when sun-force changes to\r\nchemical action, chemical action to heat, heat to electricity, &c.\r\nEnergy is, indeed, the real modern PROTEUS—constantly assuming different\r\nshapes, difficult to grasp if not held in fetters; now taking on the\r\nform of a lion, now of a flame of fire, a whirlwind, a rushing stream.\r\nAs sober, literal matter of fact we catch glimpses of energy under these\r\nvery forms.\r\n\r\nThe greatest discovery of the age has, as already indicated, immediate\r\nand important practical bearings. The amount of thought which, even in\r\nthe present day, is devoted by unscientific mechanics to the old problem\r\nof perpetual motion is far greater than is generally supposed. The\r\nprinciple of the conservation of energy shows that this is an\r\nimpossibility; that the inventor who seeks to create force might just as\r\nwell try to create matter; that the production of a perpetually moving\r\nself-sustaining machine is as far removed from human power as the\r\nbringing into existence of a new planet. In force, as in matter, the law\r\nis inexorable—_ex nihilo nihil fit_. Again, knowing the definite amount\r\nof energy obtainable from the combustion of a pound of coal, we can\r\ncompare the amount we actually procure from it in our steam engines with\r\nthis theoretical quantity as the limit towards which our improvements\r\nshould bring us continually nearer, but which we can never exceed, or,\r\nindeed, even reach. The schemers of perpetual motion are not the only\r\nclass of speculators who pursue objects which are incompatible with our\r\nprinciple. There are many who seek to accomplish desirable ends by\r\ninadequate means: who, for example, are aiming perhaps to accomplish the\r\nreduction of ores by a quantity of fuel less than that mechanically\r\nequivalent to the work, or who conceive that by adding to coal some\r\nsubstance which itself is unchanged, an indefinitely greater amount of\r\nheat may be liberated by the combustion.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that the energies of animal life can be\r\ntraced to the sun as their source. The sun builds up the plant,\r\nseparating oxygen from carbon. The animal—directly or mediately by\r\ndevouring other animals—takes the carbonaceous matter of the plant, and\r\nreunites it with oxygen. In the plant the sun winds up the spring which\r\ngives life to the animal mechanism; for the winding-up of a spring and\r\nthe separation of the atoms having chemical affinities are alike\r\ninstances of supplying potential energy. In the animal there is a\r\nrunning-down of the potential into actual energy. It is plain also that\r\nof the total energy radiated from the sun in every direction, the earth\r\nreceives but a very small part (1/2300000000). By far the larger part is\r\ndiffused into space, where, for all such purposes as those with which we\r\nare concerned, it is lost. The heat which the sun sends out in a year is\r\ncalculated to be equal to that which would be produced by the combustion\r\nof a layer of coal 17 miles thick over the whole surface of the\r\nluminary. Is the sun, then, a flaming fire? By no means. Combustion is\r\nnot possible at its temperature; and as we know the substances which\r\nenter into its composition are the same as those we find in the earth,\r\nwe know that the chemical energies of such substances could not supply\r\nthe sun’s expenditure. Passing over as unsatisfactory an explanation\r\nwhich might occur to some minds—namely, that the sun was created hot at\r\nthe beginning, and has so continued—there are two theories which attempt\r\nto account for the sun’s heat. One is that of Meyer, who supposes the\r\nheat is due to the continual impact of meteorites drawn to the sun by\r\nits gravity; and the other is that of Helmholtz, who attributes the heat\r\nto the continual condensation of the substance of the sun. Helmholtz\r\ncalculates that a shrinking of the sun’s diameter by only 1/10000th of\r\nits present amount, would supply heat to last for two thousand years;\r\nwhile the condensation of the substance of the sun to the density of the\r\nearth would cover the sun’s expenditure for 17,000,000 of years. There\r\nis great probability that both theories may be correct, and that the\r\ncause of the sun’s heat may be considered as due in general terms to\r\naggregation of matter, by which the original potential energy of\r\nposition is converted into the actual energy of heat and light. Now,\r\nhowever immense may be our planetary system, the sun being continually\r\nthrowing off this energy into space, there must come a time when the\r\nsupplies of meteorites will fail, and when the great globe of the sun\r\nwill have shrunk to its smallest dimensions. We see, then, that heat and\r\nlight are produced by the aggregation of matter; the heat and light are\r\nradiated into space; the small fraction intercepted by our globe is the\r\nsource of almost every movement—the original stuff, so to speak, out of\r\nwhich all terrestrial forces are made. The sun produces the winds, the\r\nthunderstorms, the electric currents of the Aurora, the phenomena of\r\nterrestrial magnetism, and is the source of vegetable and animal life.\r\nThe waves, the rains, the mountain torrents, the flowing rivers, are the\r\nwork of the sun’s emanations.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration of the energy expended on raising a weight\r\nafterwards dropped, we traced that energy into the final form of heat of\r\na low temperature radiated into space. It would be easy to show that all\r\nenergy ultimately takes the same form. Now, although it is easy to\r\nconvert work into heat, there is no conceivable process by which\r\nuniformly-diffused heat can again be made to do any kind of work. The\r\ncase may be compared to water, which in moving down from a higher to a\r\nlower level may be made to perform any variety of work. But when all the\r\nwater has passed down from the higher level to the lower, it can no\r\nlonger do any work. Whenever work is done by the agency of heat, there\r\nis always a passing from a higher temperature to a lower—a transference\r\nof heat from a hotter body to a colder. If the condenser of the steam\r\nengine had the same temperature as the steam, the machine would not\r\nwork. Not only do all the energies in operation on the face of the earth\r\ncontinually run down into the form of radiant heat sent off by the earth\r\ninto space; but our sun’s energy, and that of the suns of other systems,\r\nare also continually passing off into space; and the final effect must\r\nbe a uniform diffusion of heat in a universe in which none of the varied\r\nforms of energy we now behold in operation will be possible, because all\r\nwill have run down to the same dead level of uniformly-diffused heat.\r\nThis startling corollary from the principle of the conservation of\r\nenergy has been worked out by Sir W. Thomson under the title of “The\r\nDissipation of Energy.” It leads us to contemplate a state of things in\r\nwhich all light and life will have passed away from the universe—a\r\ncondition which the poet’s terrible dream of darkness, “which was not\r\nall a dream,” seems to shadow forth—\r\n\r\n          “The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars\r\n          Did wander darkling in the eternal space,\r\n          Rayless and pathless; and the icy earth\r\n          Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                              The world was void,\r\n          The populous and the powerful was a lump,\r\n          Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless—\r\n          A lump of death—a chaos of hard clay.\r\n          The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,\r\n          And nothing stirred within their silent depths.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,\r\n          The Moon, their mistress, had expired before;\r\n          The winds were withered in the stagnant air,\r\n          And the clouds perished; Darkness had no need\r\n          Of aid from them—She was the Universe.”\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of this persistence and dissipation of energy completely\r\nharmonizes with the grand speculation termed the “nebular hypothesis,”\r\nwhich regards the universe as having originally consisted of uniformly\r\ndiffused matter, which, being endowed with the power of gravitation,\r\naggregated round certain centres. This process is still going on; and,\r\naccording to modern speculations, light and life and motion are but\r\nmanifestations of this primæval potential energy being converted into\r\nactual energy, and degrading ultimately into the form of\r\nuniversally-diffused heat. To quote the closing sentences of the\r\neloquent passage in which Professor Tyndall concludes the work mentioned\r\nabove, “To nature nothing can be added, from nature nothing can be taken\r\naway; the sum of her energies is constant, and the utmost man can do in\r\nthe pursuit of physical truth, or in the applications of physical\r\nknowledge, is to shift the constituents of the never-varying total. The\r\nlaw of conservation rigidly excludes both creation and annihilation.\r\nWaves may change to ripples, and ripples to waves; magnitude may be\r\nsubstituted for number, and number for magnitude; asteroids may\r\naggregate to suns, suns may resolve themselves into floræ and faunæ, and\r\nfloræ and faunæ melt in air: the flux of power is eternally the same. It\r\nrolls in music through the ages, and all terrestrial energy—the\r\nmanifestations of life as well as the display of phenomena—are but the\r\nmodulations of its rhythm.”\r\n\r\nThe discoveries to which we have here endeavoured to attract the\r\nreader’s attention thus give rise to conceptions of the utmost grandeur\r\nand interest. We see that the sum of Nature’s energies is constant; that\r\nall the manifestations of force are but the transference of power from\r\none position to another. And we have recognized the material source of\r\nall our terrestrial energies in the sun. Two theories have already been\r\nmentioned by which it is sought to account for the sun’s heat—the\r\nmeteoric theory of Meyer and Thomson, and the shrinkage theory of\r\nHelmholtz. These both assume gravitation as the primal force from which\r\nthe supply of heat and other energies must be drawn, and they assume\r\nalso that the laws of radiation and of the degradation of temperature in\r\nthe transformation of heat into other forces, as we find them operating\r\nat the earth’s surface, are equally in action in every region of space.\r\nHence is deduced that conception of the final state of the universe as\r\none of merely equally diffused temperature admitting of no further\r\ntransformation. This speculation presents the _universe_ in the aspect\r\nof a clock, now indeed going, but when once run down, incapable of ever\r\nbeing again wound up. There seems in this view a want of symmetry, so to\r\nspeak; we miss the feeling of harmonious _rhythm_ to which Tyndall\r\nrefers. There is, however, another cosmic theory, well supported by\r\naccumulating facts, which assigns to gravitation a less important part\r\nin the production of solar heat and in the evolution of worlds, and it\r\nis one which supplies also a basis for the explanation of such phenomena\r\nas aerolites, comets, variable stars, the inclination of planets’ axes\r\nto their orbits, the proper motion of our sun, and that of the so called\r\nfixed stars, of all of which the nebular hypothesis fails to give any\r\naccount; while, on the other hand, the _impact theory_, as it has been\r\nnamed, includes the other, and goes beyond it. The reader who desires to\r\npursue this subject may be referred to Croll’s book on Stellar\r\nEvolution.\r\n\r\nIn the last few paragraphs we have been dealing with speculations as\r\nmuch as with discoveries. But indeed the former are the offspring of the\r\nlatter, as certainly as one invention becomes the parent of others. The\r\nhuman mind never rests contented with the knowledge and mastery of\r\nnature actually gained, but ever seeks to pass beyond and attain still\r\ngreater power. The volume we are now bringing to a close has given but\r\nbrief and imperfect indications of specimens, taken here and there, of\r\nwhat has been done during the short period of one century. We may draw\r\nan augury for the future of man’s dominion from the powers his\r\nPromethean spirit has already grasped:\r\n\r\n           “The lightning is his slave; heaven’s utmost deep\r\n           Gives up her stars, and like a flock of sheep\r\n       They pass before his eye, are numbered, and roll on!\r\n           The tempest is his steed, he strides the air;\r\n           And the abyss shouts from her depth laid bare,\r\n       “Heaven, hast thou secrets? Man unveils me; I have none.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTES A AND B.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Note A_—_Continuation of Table on page 755, showing the quantity of\r\n                Coals raised annually in Great Britain._\r\n\r\n                       Year.

Like the well-known\r\n“first law of motion,” it can neither be demonstrated _à priori_, nor\r\nproved by any direct and simple experiment. The first law of motion\r\nasserts that a body in motion, not acted on by any external force, will\r\ncontinue to move in a straight line, and with a uniform velocity. Now we\r\ncannot place a body in such a position that it will not be acted upon by\r\nsome external forces; but the more we lessen the effect of external\r\nforces, the more nearly is the motion straight and uniform. Similarly in\r\nthe case supposed, the intention is to show that the weight carried up\r\nis in a position to do just as much work as was done upon it. We must\r\nsuppose several impracticable but conceivable conditions in order to\r\neliminate considerations which do not concern the theoretical question;\r\nwe must suppose the cord to be weightless and absolutely devoid of\r\nrigidity; the pulley to have no mass or inertia, that is to require no\r\nforce to set it in motion, and to move without any friction; the air to\r\noffer no resistance; and the force of gravity to be uniform throughout\r\nthe space. Some approximation to these conditions is practicable, as,\r\nfor example, the pulley might be the lightest possible, and turn on\r\nfriction wheels, the cord might be the finest silk thread, and so on.\r\nBut it is not the influence of these external forces we are considering,\r\nbut only the energy due to the position of the raised weight. Assuming,\r\ntherefore, the disturbing conditions absolutely eliminated, it is not\r\ndifficult to see that no downward force or pressure, however small,\r\ncould be applied for ever so short a time, to the upper weight without\r\nsetting the system in motion. The motion would be an accelerated one so\r\nlong as the force was applied, it would become uniform when the force\r\nceased to act; it would have a velocity proportionate to the force. In\r\nany case, after a time the descending weight would reach the ground, and\r\nfor our point of view it is quite immaterial whether the time occupied\r\nby the movement were 5 minutes or 5,000 years, for be it observed, time\r\ndoes not enter into the definition of _work_ as it does into that of\r\n“horse-power.” Then by pushing the conceived conditions to their limits,\r\nwe may see that without considering any question of conversion of motion\r\ninto heat, the raised weight can, in theory at least, give back again\r\nthe energy spent upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A.\r\n\r\n Abel, Professor, 746.\r\n\r\n Accumulators, 530.\r\n\r\n Adhesion of locomotive, 21.\r\n\r\n Advantages of present age, 2.\r\n\r\n Aerolites, 30.\r\n\r\n Air, 734.\r\n\r\n Albert Bridge, Saltash, 283.\r\n\r\n Alizarine, 797.\r\n\r\n “_Alliance_” magneto-electric machine, 520.\r\n\r\n Aluminium, 717.\r\n   bronze, 719.\r\n   reduced cost of, 723.\r\n\r\n American Tract Society building, 78.\r\n\r\n Ampère’s hypothesis, 750.\r\n   rule, 492, 549.\r\n\r\n _Amphioxus_, 679.\r\n\r\n ANÆSTHETICS, 731.\r\n\r\n Anemometer, 656.\r\n\r\n Angle, limiting, or critical, 399.\r\n\r\n Aniline, 787.\r\n   black, 793.\r\n   blue, 790.\r\n   green, 791.\r\n   purple, 788.\r\n\r\n Anomalous magnetisation, 538.\r\n\r\n _Anthea Cereus_, 678.\r\n\r\n Anthracene, 796, 797.\r\n\r\n Applegath printing machine, 312.\r\n   and Cowper, ditto, 308.\r\n\r\n Apps’s anemometer, 656.\r\n   induction coil, 506.\r\n\r\n AQUARIA, 675.\r\n\r\n Arago, 599.\r\n\r\n Architecture, use of iron in, 72.\r\n\r\n Argand gas burners, 773.\r\n   lamps, 595.\r\n\r\n Armours, ships’, strengths of, 166.\r\n\r\n Armstrong 110–ton gun, 202.\r\n\r\n Armstrong’s guns, 192.\r\n   hydraulic crane, 333.\r\n\r\n Atoms, 733, 743.\r\n\r\n Aurora, 504.\r\n\r\n Australian gold, 688.\r\n\r\n Austrian torpedoes, 229.\r\n\r\n “_Automobile_” competition, 23.\r\n\r\n Axolotl, 686.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   B.\r\n\r\n Bacon, Francis, 799.\r\n\r\n Balloon, photographic, 628.\r\n\r\n Basic process (Gilchrist’s), 66.\r\n\r\n Battery, galvanic, 493.\r\n\r\n Battery, secondary, 530.\r\n\r\n Baxter House experiments, 58.\r\n\r\n Bell Rock Lighthouse, 593.\r\n\r\n Bells, electro-magnetic, 554.\r\n\r\n Benzol, 783.\r\n\r\n Bessemer, 26, 56.\r\n   Channel steamer, 142.\r\n   converter, 63.\r\n   iron, 62.\r\n   process, 64.\r\n   steel, 56–67.\r\n\r\n BIG WHEELS, 81.\r\n\r\n Bitter Lakes, 261.\r\n\r\n BLANCHARD LATHE, THE, 86.\r\n\r\n Blast furnace, 40.\r\n\r\n Blind spot in eye, 460.\r\n\r\n Blister steel, 54.\r\n\r\n Blood spectra, 431.\r\n\r\n Boilers of steam engines, 13.\r\n\r\n Boring for coals, 361.\r\n\r\n Bourdon’s pressure gauge, 12.\r\n\r\n Bourseul, M., 582.\r\n\r\n Box girders, 280.\r\n\r\n Breakwater, 258.\r\n\r\n Breakwaters for Suez Canal, 258.\r\n\r\n BREECH-LOADING RIFLES, 182.\r\n\r\n Brewster, Sir D., 405, 420, 470, 474.\r\n\r\n Bridge, projected Channel, 296.\r\n\r\n Bridgewater Canal, 250, 266.\r\n\r\n BRIGHTON AQUARIUM, 682.\r\n\r\n Britannia Bridge, 280.\r\n   raising tubes, 336.\r\n\r\n British Aluminium Co., 723.\r\n\r\n British navy in 1894, 167.\r\n\r\n BROOKLYN BRIDGE, 303.\r\n\r\n “Brown Bess,” 178.\r\n\r\n Browning’s micro-spectroscopes, 434.\r\n   spectroscope, 422, 432.\r\n\r\n Brunel, 283.\r\n\r\n Brunswick rifle, 180.\r\n\r\n Brush dynamo, 522.\r\n\r\n Bullet, Greener’s expanding, 182.\r\n   Lebel, 188.\r\n   Minié, 180.\r\n\r\n Bullets, machinery for making, 330.\r\n\r\n Bunsen and Kirchhoff, 422.\r\n   and Roscoe, 720.\r\n\r\n Bunsen’s battery, 496.\r\n   burner, 421.\r\n\r\n Bye-products in gas making, 772.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   C.\r\n\r\n Cable railways, 126.\r\n\r\n Cæsium, 426.\r\n\r\n Caissons for Forth Bridge, 293.\r\n\r\n _Calais-Douvres_, steamship, 141.\r\n\r\n Caledonian Canal, 250.\r\n\r\n Calico printing machines, 321.\r\n\r\n California, discovery of gold in, 688.\r\n\r\n Camera, 613.\r\n\r\n Canal, Caledonian, 250.\r\n   Manchester Ship, 262.\r\n   Nicaragua, 274.\r\n   North Sea, 271.\r\n   Panama, 272.\r\n   Suez, 251.\r\n\r\n CANTILEVER BRIDGES, 291.\r\n\r\n “Cape Horn,” 120.\r\n\r\n _Captain_, H.M.S., 141.\r\n\r\n Carbon transmitter, 590.\r\n\r\n Carbonic oxide, 44, 48.\r\n\r\n Carbons for arc lights, 527.\r\n\r\n Carcel lamp, 597.\r\n\r\n Carpenter, Dr. W.
