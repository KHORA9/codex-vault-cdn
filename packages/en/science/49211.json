If it leaves the reader with an impulse to\r\nfollow the subject further than has been possible here, it will have\r\nmore than fulfilled its mission.\r\n\r\nThroughout the book, it has often been convenient to refer to plants or\r\ntheir behavior in terms implying reasoning faculties. Of course, plants\r\nare never reasoning things, reasonable as many of their actions appear\r\nto be, and to ascribe such qualities to them is to saddle them with\r\nattributes perfectly foreign to the plant world. But the description of\r\nthem in the terms of our everyday speech, the translation of plant\r\nbehavior into the current conceptions of mankind, does so fix these in\r\nour minds that they cease to be among those interesting things that\r\nnearly everyone forgets. I have followed this method deliberately,\r\nunderstanding perfectly the objections to it, but believing, with the\r\nlate C. E. Bessey, that in popular books “it is an admirable way of\r\nlooking at some botanical things.”\r\n\r\nAll of the half-tone illustrations, except two, are from the\r\nphotographic collections of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and I am under\r\nthe greatest obligation to the director of that institution for\r\npermission to publish them here. The illustration of the living and\r\nfossil algæ has been taken from Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn’s “Origin\r\nand Evolution of Life,” with his kind permission. The illustration of\r\ndesert vegetation is from a photograph by the late E. L. Morris, and\r\nkindly loaned from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. All the line\r\ncuts in the text are from drawings made specially for this book by my\r\nwife, Bertha Fanning Taylor.\r\n\r\nWhile grateful and particular acknowledgments can be made for the\r\nillustrations, it is difficult or impossible to properly express my\r\nindebtedness to all those who, through their books and pamphlets, have\r\nindirectly aided in the making of this book. It would involve the\r\nmention of most of the better known writers of the books found in the\r\nlarger botanical libraries. It is a pleasure to acknowledge help from\r\nDr. M. A. Howe of the New York Botanical Garden on the literature of\r\nfossil and hot-spring algæ, and from Dr. Orland E. White of the Brooklyn\r\nBotanic Garden for helpful criticism of the section dealing with “How\r\nPlants Change Their Characters.”\r\n\r\nNORMAN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nBROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN\r\n20th October, 1920\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                             PAGE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY--PLANTS AND OUR DAILY NEEDS                               9\r\n\r\nI.

It is easy to say in opposition\r\nto this that we get much food from animals, that we can drink water, and\r\nthat neither of these comes from plants. But water would soon be lost to\r\nus if forests did not conserve it, and upon pasturage most of our food\r\nanimals depend for their life. The discovery of a single tree in the\r\nmountains of northern South America made possible for white man the\r\nmalarial regions unfit for him before the advent of quinine. Just before\r\nShakespeare’s time sugar and tea and coffee became regular articles of\r\ncommerce. Not until the discovery of America was tobacco, Indian corn,\r\nchocolate, the pineapple or the potato known to man. Upon the spruce\r\nforests in the north depends much of our paper supply, from cotton we\r\nget clothes and explosives, from hemp and sisal ropes, from a single\r\nkind of Brazilian tree most of our rubber, and from rice a food that\r\nsustains nearly half the world.\r\n\r\nWhile it is thus plain enough that life depends upon plants now present\r\nupon the earth it may not be so obvious that from certain ancient\r\nforests has come the greatest source of artificial heat in the world.\r\nCoal is nothing but the partial decomposition of vast forests, living\r\nages before man was first found upon the earth, subsequently buried, and\r\nunder the earth’s pressure forming soft coal, or where the pressure was\r\nsevere enough hard coal. When it is remembered that a dead, partly\r\ndecayed tree is only a fraction of its living size and that coal is\r\nfound in many parts of the world in tremendous quantities we get a\r\npartial glimpse of what our debt is to a great forest that lived in\r\nluxuriance no one knows how many millions of years ago, reached its\r\nclimax, and upon whose embedded remains we depend for heat.\r\n\r\nLater on in this book will be given in greater detail some of the plants\r\nuseful to man and just how we have used them. Hardly any part of the\r\nstudy of the plant kingdom has so much of interest as that dealing with\r\nour utilization of the things that grow about us. From the earliest\r\nstruggles of our half-savage ancestors to grow definite crops rescued\r\nfrom the wild down to our modern nut butter made from the partly\r\nfermented meat of the cocoanut and shipped half round the world before\r\nit is refined, man has constantly striven to use for his advantage the\r\nplants most likely to prove valuable. Countries and empires have been\r\nbuilt upon such facts. Even to-day rubber from the Straits Settlements\r\nand palm oil from Africa are deciding the economic life of those\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nBut man’s use of plants, in fact his absolute reliance upon them, is not\r\nthe only reason for attempting to find out more about them, what they\r\nare, where they came from, how they live and produce their young. A\r\nknowledge of even a small part of such a science opens up a rich field\r\nof inquiry involving a concept of plant life of greater interest than\r\nmere bread and butter. For those with an eye to see and knowledge to\r\ninterpret, a landscape with its trees or flowers or marshes may contain\r\na host of hidden secrets of dramatic import. Unfolded before one may be\r\nfound a spectacle of struggle and strife, quiet tragedies of the forest,\r\nthe inexorable pressure of plants upon their neighbors, the woods upon\r\nthe prairies or an apparently forlorn hope of some plant living in a hot\r\ndesert or upon some icy mountain peak. And while these rather obvious\r\nthings are happening how much more is hidden of the adjustments that\r\nleaves or flowers or roots or other organs of the plant are constantly\r\nmaking to the conditions about them. Upon the perfection of such\r\nadjustments to light, heat, or water, for instance, depends their very\r\nexistence. Mistakes are fatal, the forces of nature seem peculiarly\r\nrelentless, and it is literally a case where many are called but few\r\nchosen. Of the untold millions of seeds produced each year few ever\r\ngrow, yet out of this enormous wastage springs all that makes the earth\r\nnot only habitable but the beautiful panorama of vegetation to which we\r\nare so accustomed that it is nearly taken for granted.\r\n\r\nThe study of botany attempts to answer some of the questions raised\r\nabove and many others. Subsequent parts of the book will deal with what\r\nplants are, the behavior of them, with the life histories of some of the\r\nbetter known ones, with the grouping of plants in families and their\r\nrelationships one to another, with their uses to man, with the history\r\nof their development from the earliest times, and finally with their\r\ndistribution over the earth. The latter will be discussed last because\r\nit is the most important of all the phases of plant life. How plants are\r\ndistributed, whether as forest or prairie or thickets or what not,\r\ndepends upon the response of individual plants and their organs to the\r\nconditions about them. The type of vegetation in different parts of the\r\nworld has been dictated by the success of the survivors in meeting\r\nexisting conditions and of having met them in the past. Upon this fact\r\nrests our civilization to-day. Upon this fact there has been reared a\r\nstudy the cultural, esthetic, and practical value of which may well\r\noutweigh any other.\r\n\r\nWhile the study of botany is necessarily a technical one with a language\r\nall its own, its terms, though generally unfamiliar, are unexcelled for\r\ntheir purpose. They will be avoided here as much as a clear\r\nunderstanding of the subject will permit. The few that must be used will\r\nbe explained where they first occur and it is assumed that the reader\r\nwill understand their subsequent use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWHAT PLANTS ARE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we commonly call plants, such as corn or buttercups or an oak tree,\r\nare so familiar that a definition of what plants are may seem needless.\r\nIt would be quite so if these generally recognized examples comprised\r\nall the plant kingdom. Actually what are ordinarily thought of as plants\r\nmake up only a fraction of the great plant world. The fact that our\r\nfamiliar roadside and garden plants produce blossoms followed by a fruit\r\nand seed, such as peas and beans and all the ordinary flora of any\r\nregion, separates them at once from that other large group of plants\r\nthat do not. Common examples of the latter class are the green scum on\r\nthe ponds, moss, seaweed, the rust on wheat, yeast, disease-causing\r\nbacteria, the smallest of all known plants, and many others. Most of\r\nthese organisms are so small that they can be distinguished only under\r\nthe higher powers of the microscope. Some of them in their habits and\r\ngrowth are like the minute animals described in the volume of this\r\nseries devoted to that subject. In fact there are organisms about which\r\nscientists are still in doubt as to their animal or vegetable character.\r\n\r\nOne or two characteristics common to most plants, however, separate them\r\nfrom animals and these are their method of getting food and their\r\npractically immovable mode of life. Animals, however simple, do eat and\r\ndigest their food, plants take various mineral substances from the earth\r\nor air or water in the form of inorganic matter such as oxygen, carbon,\r\nnitrogen, and all the food materials found in the soil, and transform\r\nthem, with the aid of sunshine, into the structure that characterizes\r\neach particular form. _Plants, then, may be defined as any living\r\norganism that, with minor exceptions, has the power to assimilate\r\ninorganic substances and transform them into organic matter._ Nothing\r\nelse in all the realm of nature has this power. It is a possession\r\nbeyond all price, this ability to take from the soil and air and water\r\nsimple chemical substances and under the magic of sunlight transform\r\nthem into the wonderful plant life of the world. But this faculty has\r\nits handicaps, for it is usually, though not always, associated with\r\ninability to move from place to place, which, in some measure, even the\r\nsimplest animals can accomplish.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that this definition of plants includes\r\nmany other things that are commonly attributed to the plant kingdom. For\r\nour purpose the discussion of these relatively unfamiliar forms of plant\r\nlife will be left until later. A rough and ready distinction between\r\nthose plants that everyone recognizes as such and those others like\r\nyeast and microbes, which are plants to most of us only by virtue of the\r\ndefinition given above, is that the first group produce flowers and\r\nseeds and the second do not. It should not be forgotten, and it will be\r\nshown later, that this is not a true distinction, but for practical\r\npurposes of dividing the plant kingdom it suffices.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FLOWERING PLANTS\r\n\r\nThe fact of outstanding importance to everyone who really looks at most\r\nplants is that part of them are above ground and part below. This simple\r\nobservation carries with it the recognition of a fundamental difference\r\nof plant structure, namely roots and stem. Most plants bear obvious\r\nleaves, and at some time in their life flowers, inevitably followed by\r\nfruits and seeds. The ideally perfect plant would consist, then, of\r\nroot, stem, leaves, flowers, fruit, and seed. These are subject to many\r\nchanges of form, sometimes they are put to strange uses, and\r\noccasionally one or two may be lacking, as the stem is apparently from\r\nmany violets, and leaves from some cactus and from the Tjemoro tree of\r\nMalaya. In fact, so varied are the different forms of these common\r\nattributes of most plants, so important are these differences of\r\nstructure that no right understanding of plant life can be had without\r\nexamining each in some detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROOT\r\n\r\nThe obvious purpose of the roots of plants is to serve as an anchorage\r\nor holdfast. Their other and equally important function is to secure\r\nfood for the plant, a process that will be described in the part devoted\r\nto Plant Behavior. Certain plants bear no roots and attach themselves to\r\nthe roots of other plants in which case they literally steal their food,\r\nas does the mistletoe and some others.\r\n\r\nRoots are of various kinds, depending upon the soil in which they grow\r\nand upon the kind of plant to which they are attached. In the case of\r\n_annuals_, which live only one year, as does the purslane, and\r\n_biennials_, which live only two years, as does the fringed gentian, the\r\nroots are mostly fibrous (Figure 1) and apt to be only slightly under\r\nthe surface. In _perennials_, which live many years, such as the\r\ndandelion, the root is deeper and forms what is known as a _taproot_\r\n(Figure 2). In shrubs and trees they are harder, woodier, and often\r\npenetrate to great depths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--FIBROUS ROOTS\r\n\r\nAs illustrated by the common garden nasturtium.]\r\n\r\nIf we examine the roots of a tree, we find a large part of them are\r\nwoody, often as thick as the smaller branches, and it is only toward\r\ntheir extremities that they branch out into the multitude of rootlets\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--TAP ROOT OF CARROT\r\n\r\nA store of food for the second year.]\r\n\r\nthat creep through the earth seeking food for the tree. Some, as in the\r\nspruce or hemlock, do not go very deep but spread great distances\r\nthrough the soil in search of food, others, like the hickory, go nearly\r\nstraight down. The interesting feature of these tree roots is that the\r\npart nearest the trunk is all but dead, and acts mostly as an anchor,\r\nwhile the fibrous rootlets or even finer subdivisions known as _root\r\nhairs_ at the extremities are the food gatherers. At the very end of all\r\nrootlets and of roots is a _rootcap_ (Figure 3), harder than the rest of\r\nthe threadlike rootlet. This rootcap is, if not quite dead, at least\r\nuseless as a food gatherer, but serves as a tiny pioneer wedge which\r\nforces its way among stones or other obstructions, so allowing the\r\nliving root hairs just behind to gather the food to which it leads the\r\nway. In certain of the rocky islands of the Bahamas wild fig trees may\r\nbe seen, growing on the bare rocks, their roots sprawling in every\r\ndirection in search of a crevice through which the rootcap can force its\r\nway. Such roots may extend thirty or forty feet from the trunk of the\r\ntree over the bare rock in search of a favorable crack where they plunge\r\nto the cool depths and secure the food and water necessary for life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--TAP ROOT OF SEEDLING\r\n\r\nThe figure shows the root cap at the extremity.]\r\n\r\nRoots are not always of this common type. Sometimes, particularly in\r\ncertain biennials, they are swelled to form great thickened portions,\r\noften weighing many pounds. The sweet potato is a familiar example, and\r\na related plant, one of our morning-glories, has an enormous perennial\r\nroot, known to weigh as much as fifty pounds. This swelling of the\r\nroots of plants is a quite common characteristic of certain kinds and\r\nhas great commercial significance. Carrots, turnips, rutabagas, beets,\r\nand parsnips are familiar examples. The purpose of such roots is to\r\nstore food for the plant, and this thrifty habit of some roots has been\r\nturned by the gardeners to our advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is a common sight to see parts of a sidewalk heaved up by a tree root\r\nand their force in this respect is tremendous. One of our common ferns\r\nhas been known to raise a weight of over 500 pounds, and even to break\r\nthrough a concrete walk. Such is the force exerted by the roots of\r\nplants that we can truly think of roots as pushing through the earth\r\nalmost regardless of obstacles, binding the soil together and not only\r\nserving the needs of the plants, but actually holding the soil on steep\r\nslopes. Where fire or ruthless lumbering has stopped this natural\r\nprocess the washing away of the soil and exposure of the bare rocks\r\nleaves desolation behind it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--ADVENTITIOUS ROOTS OF THE TOMATO\r\n\r\nProduced from joints or injured places.]\r\n\r\nWhile most roots live under the surface many grow in the air, and a few\r\ngrow from stems that are injured. The tomato vine often produces roots\r\nat the joints or where it has been injured. Such roots, known as\r\n_adventitious roots_ (Figures 4 and 5), are fairly common in many\r\nplants, the common garden practice of making cuttings, which take root\r\nunder favorable conditions, being based upon this fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--PROP ROOTS OF THE INDIAN CORN\r\n\r\nUsually produced from the first joint above ground and serving as\r\nadditional anchor and food gatherers.]\r\n\r\nBut some plants produce roots in the air, as in poison ivy and the\r\ntrumpet creeper, without injury or the gardener’s skill, and are known\r\nas _aërial roots_. They are some of the most peculiar and fantastic of\r\nnature’s devices for allowing plants to grow in apparently unfavorable\r\nplaces. In many orchids, some relatives of the pineapple, and a few\r\nother air-inhabiting plants, the roots live wholly in the air, the\r\nplants being fastened to a tree or even to a telegraph wire. Such plants\r\nlive on the air and water vapor, and are mostly inhabitants of moist\r\ntropical regions.\r\n\r\nQuite the most extraordinary of aërial roots are those produced in\r\ncertain kinds of fig trees. Starting perhaps a hundred feet in the air\r\nand no thicker than a lead pencil they appear first as slender vine-like\r\nstreamers blown hither and yon by the wind. Eventually they reach the\r\nground and penetrate it, grow often to a great size and even form\r\ntrunklike connections with the tree top. The banyan tree of India is the\r\nbest known case of this peculiar habit. One which started from a single\r\ntrunk, subsequently sending out great numbers of aërial roots, has now\r\nspread to such a size that it is over 2,000 feet in circumference, has\r\n3,000 trunks, and once sheltered 7,000 soldiers.\r\n\r\nA variation of this habit is the case of a giant fig tree of the West\r\nIndies in which a bird may deposit the seed of another tree. The\r\nseedling soon develops, sending out long, at first threadlike, aërial\r\nroots which are wrapped around the tree trunk. As the roots increase in\r\nsize and further encircle the trunk they ultimately reach the ground,\r\nwhere they are frequently a foot in diameter. Then the true nature of\r\nthe process becomes evident. For these apparently innocent aërial roots,\r\nas they reach the ground, have so completely inclosed the old trunk and\r\ntheir pressure is so great that they literally strangle the tree from\r\nwhich they started. It is slower but just as deadly as the strangulation\r\nof an animal by a boa constrictor, for these encircling roots cut off\r\nby strangulation the ascent of the sap, thus killing the tree. Fate\r\nsometimes overtakes them, however, as it is a common sight to see the\r\nstrangler meet the same end. Some of nature’s most ruthless battles are\r\nfought out in this way, very silently, but very effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEM\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--ROOTSTOCK OF SOLOMON’S SEAL\r\n\r\nThe figure shows roots and bud scars together with the ascending stem of\r\nthe year’s growth.]\r\n\r\nNothing dies harder than generally accepted delusions, particularly\r\nthose regarding plant lore, and of all such incorrect impressions the\r\none that a potato is a root, is the hardiest and most difficult to kill.\r\nYet, the “eyes” of a potato give it away if one stops for a moment to\r\nreflect that the eyes are only buds and buds grow only on stems. That is\r\none of the chief uses of stems--to support in the air the leaves and\r\nflowers that come from its buds, and no matter if the stem, as in the\r\npotato and many other plants, be ever so deeply buried their true stem\r\nnature cannot be mistaken. Sometimes these underground stems are not\r\nthickened but lengthened out, in which case, notably in common garden\r\niris, they are called _rootstocks_. Again, these buried stems may be\r\nswollen, as in the potato, when they are known as _tubers_. Onions and\r\nthe jack-in-the-pulpit bear still other kinds of underground stems, and\r\nthere are many more, but they cannot be mistaken for roots, for it will\r\nbe seen from Figures 6-9 that on their under sides they bear roots\r\nthemselves. Besides this they bear buds or shoots, which no true root\r\never does.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--CORM OF JACK-IN-THE PULPIT\r\n\r\n(After Gray)\r\n\r\nReally an underground stem.]\r\n\r\nStems above ground, which is the most usual form for them, are of many\r\nkinds, all serving the purpose of support to the leaves and flowers, and\r\nas a means of carrying sap from the roots or underground stems to the\r\nupper part of the plant, and also to carry certain foods to the roots\r\nfrom the leaves, of which more anon. In the case of herbs, like\r\ngoldenrod or daisy, the stem may be apparently all pith on the inside,\r\nwith only a thin outer coating of harder substance, not unlike bark, but\r\nusually green. If we examine the cut-off trunk of a tree, a quite\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--TUBERS OF THE COMMON POTATO\r\n\r\nPotatoes are swollen portions of rootstock.]\r\n\r\ndifferent structure is apparent. Any lumberman can point out at once\r\n“heartwood” and “sapwood” (Figure 78), and his distinctions are just as\r\ngood as those of the scientist, for he says in these two words as\r\nplainly as can be said that heartwood is the oldest and sapwood the\r\nyoungest. The sapwood is nearer the bark and is honeycombed with\r\npassages which serve to carry the sap from the roots to the tree top,\r\nwhile just under the bark is the bright, green, living layer, known as\r\n_cambium_, which is renewed each year. The _phloem_ is the carrier for\r\nthe food made in the leaves to the roots. It is the successive layers of\r\n_cambium_, year after year, that gives to tree trunks their annual\r\nrings. The age of almost all trees can be reckoned exactly by counting\r\nthese, one representing a year’s growth, and the tree’s rate of growth\r\nestimated from the closeness of the rings. Fires or droughts, perhaps\r\nlong forgotten, here find a lasting record in rings so close together as\r\nto be all but invisible. The part nearest the center of the trunk is the\r\nheartwood, usually quite lifeless, yet in its maturity furnishing us\r\nwith lumber. It may be and often is completely decayed, without injuring\r\nthe flow of sap or the life of the tree for many years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--BULB OF THE ONION\r\n\r\nShowing root and leaf growth.]\r\n\r\nThese two streams of sap, one going up and the other returning to the\r\nroots, each in its proper channel, are interspersed with air chambers\r\nthat extend from the center of the tree out toward the bark, where they\r\nend in inconspicuous dots called _lenticels_. It is as though nature had\r\nprovided an air-cooling device for the constant activity of these\r\ndiverse currents. These lenticels are prominent on the bark of cherry,\r\nbut whether obvious or not they are found in nearly all woody stems and\r\ninsure a constant supply of fresh air to the busy interior.\r\n\r\nIn palms, sugar cane, corn, bamboo, and many other plants there is not\r\nany distinction between heartwood and sapwood (Figure 82), and in place\r\nof bark there is nothing but an outer rind, harder than the interior\r\ntissue. Such stems do not usually rot first at the center, have no\r\ncambium, and have no annual rings. This method of growth and structure\r\nis associated nearly always with definite leaf and flower forms peculiar\r\nto it and differing from most other plants. So fundamental are these\r\ncharacteristics, so uniform their occurrence and so clear are the\r\ndistinctions between them and other plants that botanists have divided\r\nall flowering plants into those belonging to this group or to some\r\nothers. More will be said of this in the chapter on the Families of\r\nPlants and Their Relationship.\r\n\r\nThe stems of some plants, such as the Big Trees of California, for\r\ninstance, are among the oldest and most permanent of living things.\r\n“General Sherman,” one of the biggest in that most famous grove, was\r\nnearly three thousand five hundred years old when Columbus discovered\r\nAmerica; it has lived through all the great periods of modern history,\r\nand to-day it is over 270 feet high and 35 feet in diameter. No living\r\nthing is so large or has lived so long. In Australia are great forests\r\nof blue gum trees even taller than our Californian Big Trees, but not so\r\nold nor so thick.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific, off the coast of Oregon and British Columbia, a seaweed\r\nis commonly found with stalks over 500 feet long, and in India the\r\nrattan palm climbs over the tree tops for great distances, a single stem\r\nnot much thicker than a broomstick measuring over 700 feet long. The\r\nsearch by leaves for light and air results in the stems of some plants\r\nperforming almost incredible feats. Whether it is one of the Big Trees\r\nwith a great massive trunk, or the rattan palm with its sinuous winding\r\nthrough the topmost heights of the tropical forests of India, the result\r\nis always upward to a “place in the sun.” This struggle for sunlight has\r\ntaken many forms in different plants, the ordinary vines like\r\nmorning-glory or grapevine, for instance, where the climbing stem is of\r\ngreat advantage. Some vines always twine to the left, as the hopvine,\r\nothers to the right, as in the morning-glory, all seeking support from\r\nsomething else, each adopting its own most useful way of getting its\r\nleaves in the most advantageous position to catch the life-giving\r\nsunshine. If we could look down on any forest from an aeroplane, the\r\nstriking efforts of nearly all plants, whether herbs, shrubs, vines, or\r\ntrees, to get the utmost sunshine for their leaves would be evident at\r\nonce. No apparently impossible twisting or bending of tree trunks or\r\nreaching out of stems of vines but is to be found in the inexorable\r\nstruggle of stems to fulfill their task of giving the plant its chance\r\nto reach “a place in the sun.” Sometimes mere climbing or twining does\r\nnot seem sure enough--it seems as though winds or the elements might\r\nbreak loose the vine from its support and thereby kill its chances. In\r\ncertain vines this contingency appears to have been foreseen, and as if\r\nto clinch their opportunity of growing onward they are provided with\r\nspecial helps. Slender green _tendrils_, delicate prolongations of the\r\nstem, begin, almost insidiously, to catch hold of the nearest support\r\nand by a couple of turns about it and subsequent strengthening of their\r\ntissues make a permanent holdfast. The grapevine is a case in point. And\r\nas if this were not enough, certain other plants, such as the Boston\r\nivy, have small disks which attach themselves to bare walls or tree\r\ntrunks. This is to make assurance doubly sure, and it is this that makes\r\nthe Boston ivy so useful to the gardeners for covering walls.\r\n\r\nSome stems accomplish their purpose not by holding fast to a support in\r\nthe air, but by creeping along the ground, as in the running blackberry,\r\nand often in the Virginia creeper. The purpose is the same, and, as if\r\nto confirm it, a few otherwise quite prostrate vines have their tips\r\nturned upward to the light, notably in the case of the creeping\r\nspeedwell.\r\n\r\nIn certain plants the stem may assume curious forms due to special\r\nconditions under which they live and to which adjustment is necessary\r\nfor the plant’s existence. In deserts, for instance, the cactus produces\r\npractically no leaves (Figure 10) and the green stem performs not only\r\nthe function of leaves but acts as a storage for water. Where water is\r\nscarce this is of tremendous advantage, a single cactus having been\r\nknown to store up 125 gallons. A similar habit of the cactuslike spurges\r\nin South Africa gives as weird an atmosphere to parts of their\r\nlandscapes as we find in Arizona. It is as if the stem of such plants,\r\nbeing unable to push its leaves (it has none) up into the light, takes\r\nover some of the functions of leaves and makes up the deficiency by\r\nadopting other methods\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--COMMON PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS (_Opuntia Opuntia_)\r\n\r\nNative along the Atlantic Coast. The green joints of the stem function\r\nas leaves and store water.]\r\n\r\nto secure the plant’s survival. Other stems, looking and acting like\r\nleaves, reveal their true nature by producing buds, and the curious\r\nfeature of the common butcher’s-broom (Figure 11), often colored scarlet\r\nfor Christmas decorations, bearing flowers from the middle of what is\r\napparently a leaf, but is actually a modified stem, is explained by this\r\nability of stems to modify their habits to suit conditions. The\r\nbutcher’s-broom is an inhabitant of dry regions along the Mediterranean,\r\nwhere a reduction or\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--BUTCHER’S-BROOM\r\n\r\n(_Ruscus aculeatus_)\r\n\r\nNote leaflike stems with flowers arising from the center.]\r\n\r\nabsence of leaf surface is a decided advantage. In many partly desert or\r\ndry regions this production of leaflike stems or branches is common, an\r\nexcellent garden example being asparagus, which came originally from\r\nEurope and the feathery growth of which is all stem. In Tasmania a kind\r\nof yew tree produces no leaves, all the foliage being modified stem,\r\nwhich is true of many kinds of spurge in the West Indies, where an\r\nalmost impenetrable scrub is largely made up of a shrub which is\r\napparently covered with leaves, all actually part of the branches and\r\nstems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--DUCKWEED\r\n\r\nThe smallest known flowering plant, with _no_ leaves and tiny leaflike\r\nstems floating on the surface. Flowers are borne from the margin of the\r\nstem. (Eight times natural size).]\r\n\r\nWhile stems, such as the Big Trees or the giant cactus, may be among the\r\nlargest of nature’s creations they may be also the smallest, as the\r\nduckweed that floats on ponds is the tiniest of all flowering plants and\r\nits flat expanded surface is wholly stem. Figure 12 on this page better\r\nillustrates this strange modification of a stem than words could do.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been read it will be seen that stems are not “just\r\nstems”--they are among nature’s most ingenious devices to secure the\r\nsurvival of the plant. Whether buried in the ground, and producing,\r\nalmost by stealth, buds that develop into mature plants, or thrusting\r\nleaves to the utmost limits of their reach, or climbing by an\r\nintricately varied mechanism, or changing their character to suit desert\r\nconditions, or floating on the water--it matters not. Each modification\r\nof form or use secures to the individual plant its chances to survive;\r\nand in most cases its only chance, as anyone may see by the sudden death\r\nwhich follows a series of changes which prevents a stem from performing\r\nits proper tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAF\r\n\r\nAs the palm reader is supposed to be able to tell your history and\r\nfuture from veins in your hand, and as the veins in the wing of a\r\nbutterfly tell their story to an entomologist, so the veins of a leaf\r\nare more significant than almost any other characteristic of a plant.\r\nMost leaves have their veins, or skeleton, with a single midrib and many\r\nbranches off it on each side, which themselves break up into a fine\r\nnetwork of veins. Such leaves are _netveined_ (Figures 13-24). Others,\r\nsuch as corn and grass, have the veins running side by side from one end\r\nof the leaf to the other, sometimes with small branches off them, but\r\ninstead of the veins forming a network they are parallel, and such are\r\ncalled _parallel-veined_ leaves (Figure 38). In the chapter on Plant\r\nFamilies and Their Relationship more will be said as to the amazing\r\nregularity with which netveined leaves are associated with certain kinds\r\nof flowers and parallel-veined with other kinds, how these distinctions\r\nhave been recognized since hundreds of years before Christ, long before\r\ntheir true import was understood. There are variations from both these\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANYAN TREE (_Ficus bengalensis_).

Nature shows herself in some of her\r\nwisest moods in the selection of methods to accomplish this. In some\r\nbuds, notably those of the horse-chestnut, the bud is coated with a\r\nsticky substance to protect the tender young leaves inside. In others\r\nthere is a hard outer coat, as in the hickory, impregnable to the most\r\ndriving sleet, others again have the leaf rolled so tightly and pointed\r\nso sharply at the end, as in the beech, that water cannot cling to the\r\nbud nor soak in, until the warmth of spring gives the signal for the\r\nannual miracle of the bursting out of foliage. Leaf buds are sometimes\r\nhard to find on certain plants, as they are formed at the base of a\r\nleafstalk and covered by it during the growing season. It is only as the\r\nleaf falls in the autumn that the hollow base of its stalk is seen to\r\nhave hidden during the summer the young bud for the following season.\r\nThe plane tree or sycamore is a good example of a plant where no leaf\r\nbuds can be found until the falling of the leaves in autumn.\r\n\r\nThe forms of leaves are infinite in their variety, and the reasons for\r\nsome of their peculiarities in this respect are not yet understood. The\r\naverage netveined leaf is obviously composed of a _blade_ (Figure 25),\r\nand at the base a stalk known as a _petiole_. Sometimes at the base of\r\nthe petiole--which is lacking in many leaves--there are two tiny\r\nleaflike appendages, called _stipules_, which are of no apparent use to\r\nthe plant, and, as if in recognition of this fact, they often fall off\r\nlong before autumn. In some plants, however, stipules are permanent,\r\nwhile in certain others they are never found, as, for instance, in the\r\nhorse-chestnut tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 25-35.--FORMS AND BASES OF LEAVES\r\n\r\nFig. 25.

Some of the common\r\nkinds are shown in drawings (Figures 13-24), which tell more of the\r\nstory than pages of description could do. Their margins, too, their\r\ntips, their bases (Figures 25-35), all parts of them, in fact, are so\r\nvariable and yet in each kind of plant so uniform, that in the\r\ndescription of the plants of any region the botanist has used these\r\ncharacteristics of leaves as one method of identifying the particular\r\nplant in hand.\r\n\r\nThe terms used to designate these different kinds of leaf margins or\r\nforms of blade are precise, nearly universally used, but need to be\r\nstudied only by those who, because of special fondness for the subject,\r\nare likely to need them in using books which are beyond the scope of the\r\npresent one. If, for instance, the reader is interested in finding out\r\nwhat his native roadside plants are, he would need a book describing\r\nthem, and there are many for different parts of the country. In such\r\nbooks he would find these terms, which say so much in a single word\r\n(there are other sets of terms for flowers, fruits, and seeds) totally\r\nunfamiliar and quite likely to disgust him at the start. A little study\r\nmay open up to him that most interesting and easily accessible of\r\nrecreations, a first-hand familiarity with the wild flowers of one’s own\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nAll leaves are not as simple as the figures show them to be. In many the\r\nmidrib or principal vein is much elongated and there are small\r\n_leaflets_, sometimes even scores of them, all fastened to a common\r\nstalk. Such are called _compound_ leaves (Figures 36-37), which may be\r\nfound in ash, hickory, rosebushes, blackberries, peas, beans, and\r\nthousands of other plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 36-38.--COMPOUND AND PARALLEL-VEINED LEAVES\r\n\r\nFig. 36. Palmately compound leaf, the five leaflets all arising from the\r\ntip of the common leafstalk. Fig. 37. Pinnately compound leaf, the\r\nleaflets arising from the sides of the common leafstalk. Fig 38. A\r\nparallel-veined leaf. All the other leaves figured are netted-veined.]\r\n\r\nWhile leaves are literally factories in which one of the most wonderful\r\nthings in the world is produced, it is so much a part of what plants do\r\nor their behavior that the story of it will be given in the chapter on\r\nPlant Behavior. Sunlight is absolutely necessary for the process, and to\r\nreach this sunlight leaves are attached to their stems in a variety of\r\nways. Some are always opposite each other, as in the common privet,\r\nlilac, or honeysuckle; others always alternate, as in the mustard or the\r\nrose. There are many variations of these simple arrangements, but in\r\nevery case the process results in giving each leaf the utmost exposure\r\nto the light without which the plant must wither and die. So vital is\r\nthis exposure to light that in some plants parts of the leaves produce\r\n_tendrils_, as in the case of peas, in order that some near-by support\r\nmay be used. In one African relative of our lily, this change of leaf\r\nform has been so great that its long slender leaf tip is wonderfully\r\nadapted to reaching up and catching by its curved tip some support to\r\nlift it from the gloom of the tropical forest floor.\r\n\r\nLooking down from above on any small plant or bush, or from the sky on a\r\nforest, about all that can be seen are the thousands of leaves, all so\r\narranged that it is as though some celestial photographer asked every\r\none of them to so place themselves that they would all be “in the\r\npicture.” The competition between leaves on the same plant and between\r\nleaves on rival plants is infinitely keener than the friendly pushing of\r\na crowd to get in a picture, _and it lasts forever_. Furthermore,\r\nfailure to get in means certain death. So intricate is the method of\r\nleaf arrangement, so marvelous the adjustments that all plants must make\r\nto insure ample light, that it is not inaptly called _leaf mosaic_. As\r\nwe shall see in the chapter on Plant Distribution, particularly in\r\nforests, certain variations or partial failures of the process have\r\nfar-reaching results.\r\n\r\nIf leaves did not perform this most important function to perfection,\r\nall animals, including man as well, would perish, and it would almost\r\nseem that their obligation to us and the plant world might stop there as\r\nlong as their success in reaching the light is so overwhelming. But\r\nthere are no union hours of labor, no regulation as to the kind of work\r\nleaves may perform, and some actually reach out for new tasks to do, and\r\ndo them. In one, our common pitcher plant, the leaf, as is implied by\r\nthe name, is formed into a slender hollow pitcher, wide at the mouth,\r\nbut narrow at the base. Inside the pitcher are slender downward-pointing\r\nhairs so arranged that an insect may crawl in, but never out. The lower\r\ndown the luckless insect gets the more certain is its death, and, to\r\nclinch matters, there is a tiny pool at the bottom where it is not only\r\ndrowned, but, due to the composition of the mixture in the pool,\r\ndigested. Only a very few plants can do this; only a minute fraction of\r\nthe world’s vegetation can digest animal matter. Some experiments on the\r\npitcher plant, which grows in bogs, show that it will digest bits of\r\nbeefsteak dropped into the liquid at the base of the pitcher.\r\n\r\nIn the East Indies and in Africa there is a pitcher plant--in fact,\r\nscores of varieties of them--which grows up on the branches of trees. In\r\nthis case the pitcher may be as long as some of our American kinds,\r\noften twelve to eighteen inches, and many of them are attached to a\r\nslender leafstalk two to three feet long, by which they hang suspended.\r\nInsects, literally by the thousands, are caught in these gaudy traps,\r\nfor many of the pitchers are beautifully colored, and near the opening\r\nthey secrete a sweetish liquid that lures their prey. They are, in fact,\r\nsuch curious and handsome plants that they are commonly grown in\r\ngreenhouse collections.\r\n\r\nNature sometimes finds still other ways of using strange and\r\ncurious-shaped leaves, and in our American bogs is a group of plants,\r\nalso insect digesters, still more unusual than the pitcher plants. In\r\nbright sunny places in open bogs one may often find small reddish,\r\nglistening plants, called sundews, usually only a few inches tall,\r\ncovered with sticky hairs. In fact, the glistening is due to the\r\nsecretion of the sticky substance, a tiny drop of which may be found at\r\nthe end of each hair. Flying insects are caught in these leaves, and, as\r\na fly on fly paper, the greater the struggle the more involved does the\r\ninsect become among the sticky threads. Once caught by such a plant,\r\nescape is practically impossible.\r\n\r\nLying in ambush for chance insects, as these sundews and pitcher plants\r\ndo, may seem nearly the limit of what is to be expected of leaves.\r\nMerely to be always on the job, with a plentiful supply of insect\r\ndigester, might seem to be all that could well be expected from what,\r\nafter all, are only modified leaves. But nature’s devices are infinite,\r\nand there are still other ways to accomplish the apparently impossible.\r\nIn a small section of the southeastern States there grows a plant that\r\nnot only lies passively in wait for insects, but actually captures them.\r\nThis flycatcher, known as Venus’s flytrap, has two valves to the leaf\r\nblade, supported on a stout broad stalk so arranged that their fringed\r\nsurfaces face each other. If an insect--and many do--alights between\r\nthese valves, they close together rapidly and the prisoner is hopelessly\r\ncaught by the interlocking marginal bristles that fringe each valve. In\r\nthis case there are glands on the face of the valves, against which the\r\nlive insect is tightly pressed, and which secrete a digestive fluid.\r\nWhen nothing remains the valves slowly open and are ready for the next\r\nvictim. They may be made to close by slight irritation with a lead\r\npencil, and it is the impact of the insect that releases one of the most\r\ncurious examples of movement in leaves known to us. There are a few\r\nother plants in different parts of the world that by still other\r\nmodifications of their leaves catch and digest insects, but none of them\r\nare to be considered as “insect eaters,” or other names implying that\r\nthey have definite designs on the life of passing insects. The process\r\nis sufficiently remarkable, the success of the operation so sure, that\r\nthere is nothing gained by attributing to such plants, as many have done\r\nin the past, malignant characters that are possibly confined only to\r\nman. The whole wonderful process is more reasonably explained by\r\nrealizing that all these insectivorous plants are so by virtue of\r\nnecessity, that many of them are bog plants, which are often hard put to\r\nit to get suitable food, and that the extraordinary change of shape and\r\nfunction is but one more contribution of leaves to the economy of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIn dry or desert regions, where the conservation of moisture is\r\nessential to plant growth, water storage by leaves is nearly as great an\r\naid to the plant as we have seen it to be in the stems of cactus, South\r\nAfrican spurges, etc. Our common century plant, whose leaves are, in\r\nsome kinds, a hundred times thicker than in ordinary foliage leaves, is\r\na good example of leaves adapted to water storage. In our southwestern\r\ndeserts hundreds of species of plants can exist only by virtue of the\r\nfact that their leaves are so changed in their form or structure that\r\nthey serve as reservoirs for water storage. This may be accomplished by\r\nthickening, or it is more often contrived by a thick coating of hairs.\r\nThe surfaces of thousands of different kinds of leaves are clothed with\r\nhairs either on the upper or lower side, or sometimes on both sides. In\r\nmany cases they are quite obviously protection from too rapid drying out\r\nof the leaf. In others, as in the nettle, the hairs secrete a stinging\r\nsubstance which seems to insure the plant against grazing animals.\r\n\r\nLeaves, then, are for something more than to provide the beautiful\r\nfoliage which is their most spectacular accomplishment. So varied is\r\nthis in its beauty, from plain green leaves to the wonderful coloring\r\nfound in begonias, coleus, and many other garden plants, that the sheer\r\nbeauty of the panorama of foliage is likely to blind us to the more\r\nimportant uses of leaves. First of all must we consider them the\r\nfactories, in which night and day are produced the food of all plants\r\nand most animals. Then in certain cases we have seen that, by every\r\ningenious device known to nature, they perform other special work, such\r\nas helping the plant to climb where that is necessary, catching or even\r\ncapturing insects and digesting them when that peculiar service is\r\ndemanded of them, and, finally, serving as storage reservoirs in regions\r\nwhere water is scarce. Probably no part of the plant works so\r\nunceasingly each season at its varied tasks. In the autumn, dropping to\r\nthe forest floor, its decomposition furnishes still other food for the\r\nplant, and, to crown all, this busy life and by no means unprofitable\r\ndeath leaves behind it, as a promise for the continuance of the work, a\r\nsnugly protected leaf bud which will repeat the process the next season.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWER\r\n\r\nWhile the plant’s and, consequently, our debt to the leaf is seen to be\r\ntremendous, it cannot be ignored that, if plants produced nothing but\r\nleaves, the end of all plant life would come with the death from old age\r\nor disease of the present generation of plants. Except for those kinds\r\nthat reproduce themselves by division or extension of their rootstocks,\r\nwhich bear buds, there would be no provision for increase. As only a\r\ncomparatively small number of plants can reproduce by this method, it is\r\nobvious that something more must be provided to secure new generations\r\nof plants. Flowers, and the fruits and seeds which inevitably follow\r\nthem, do this. All plants, with some exceptions to be noted later,\r\nproduce flowers at some time in their life. In the case of the century\r\nplant, only once, after which they die. But except for ferns, mushrooms,\r\nseaweed, yeast, bacteria, and some other forms of so-called flowerless\r\nplants, a flower or blossom is to be found at some stage in the life of\r\nall plants.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the leaves of a goldenrod, we find that they are large\r\nbelow and diminish in size toward the top. Just below and among the\r\nflower clusters they are so much reduced in size and often changed in\r\ncolor that they cease to be ordinary foliage leaves, and are known as\r\n_bracts_. The occurrence of bracts is nearly universal in flowering\r\nplants, and they form not only an apparently transitional stage between\r\nleaves and flowers, but an actual one.\r\n\r\nIn a complete and perfect flower there are, at the bottom of it, a row\r\nof green leaflike sheaths which\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 39-45.--THE FLOWER\r\n\r\nFig. 39. A perfect and complete flower. _A_, petals, all of them forming\r\nthe corolla; _B_, sepals, all of them forming the calyx; _C_, the\r\nstamen, composed of (_C_) the filament, and (_C_^{1}) the anther, which\r\nproduces the pollen; _D_, the pistil, consisting of the swollen base\r\n(_D_) the ovary, a slender shank (_D_^{1}) the style, and the swollen or\r\nbranched tip (_D_^{2}) the stigma.

Flowers all ray flowers, an individual one at the right. The\r\n_Compositæ_ with only ray flowers usually have a milky juice and have\r\noften been grouped in a separate family, the _Cichoriaceæ_. Common\r\nexamples are dandelion, chicory, and lettuce.]\r\n\r\nsurround and often half inclose the brightly colored petals within. This\r\nouter covering of flowers is called _calyx_ (Figure 39 B), the\r\nindividual parts of it, where they are separated, _sepals_. Their chief\r\nuse is to protect the interior petals while they are inclosed in the\r\nbud. The calyx may or may not have bracts just underneath it, as it does\r\nvery conspicuously in the case of the flowering dogwood, whose white\r\n“flowers” are really only brightly colored bracts. The transition\r\nbetween bracts and calyx is not difficult to see in many plants, and\r\nwhere it is impossible the evidence from their internal structure\r\nconfirms what our eye might be inclined to doubt.\r\n\r\nJust inside the calyx is what most people call the “flower,” which is\r\nreally composed of more highly colored sepals, but which we call\r\n_petals_ (Figure 39A). Where these are joined together the collection,\r\nwhich forms tubular flowers like the lily of the valley, is called a\r\n_corolla_. It is, of course, the petals or corollas of flowering plants\r\nthat give our landscapes their greatest beauty, their most gorgeous\r\ncoloring. While this from one point of view amply justifies a prodigal\r\nnature in strewing the earth with beautiful flowers, the true value of\r\nthe color to the plant is in quite other directions, which will be\r\nexplained a little later.\r\n\r\nToward the base of the corolla, or sometimes on the petals or sepals,\r\nmay be found a series of slender appendages, usually threadlike or a\r\nlittle thicker, crowned at the top by a distinctly large knob. The\r\nindividual appendage is known as a _stamen_ (Figure 39 C), its\r\nthreadlike portion a _filament_ (Figure 39 C), and the knoblike top an\r\n_anther_ (Figure 39 C^{1}).\r\n\r\nDirectly in the middle of the flower there is still another organ,\r\nusually swollen at the base, slender in the shank, and either thickened\r\nor branched at the tip. This central part of nearly all flowers is\r\ncalled collectively a pistil (Figure 39 D), its swollen base an _ovary_\r\n(Figure 39 D), the slender shank the _style_ (Figure 39 D^{1}), and the\r\nthickened or branched tip a _stigma_ (Figure 39 D^{2}). A perfect and\r\ncomplete flower, then, is composed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Calyx      Corolla    Stamens consisting    Pistil consisting\r\n   or     +   or      +   of filaments      +  of ovary, style,\r\n  sepals,    petals,     and anthers,          and stigma.\r\n\r\nThe stamen is the male organ of reproduction and the pistil the female.\r\nThe actual process of fertilization, pregnancy, the forming of the fruit\r\nand later the seed, and the latter’s birth of a new plant, comprise one\r\nof the most fascinating of those provisions of nature which secure the\r\nperpetuation of the plant world. In the life history of even the\r\ncommonest weed along the roadside there is this constant renewal of life\r\nby sexual reproduction, just as in animals and in man. In the chapter on\r\n“How Plants Produce Their Young” will be found some account of this\r\nsupreme function of flowers, after which, as if their usefulness were\r\nover, they wither and perish.\r\n\r\nNot all flowers are perfect or complete. Some lack petals, as the\r\nbuckwheat, where the colored calyx replaces petals. Others have neither\r\ncalyx nor corolla, as in the sycamore or plane tree. Most plants,\r\nhowever, have both calyx and corolla. In some very few plants certain of\r\nthe flowers have no stamens, when they are said to be _pistillate_ or\r\nfemale flowers, and certain others have no pistils, when they are called\r\n_staminate_ or male flowers. In other words, the sexes are in different\r\nflowers in the same cluster or plant, as is true of the walnut and\r\nhickories, when they are said to be _monœcious_. In still others the\r\nsexes are on entirely different plants, in which case they are\r\n_diœcious_, as in practically all willows. In the latter case there\r\nare _pistillate_ or female plants and _staminate_ or male plants.\r\n\r\nWhile it is a commonplace that peas do not look like daisies, nor a\r\ncarnation like a rose, this simple observation does not begin to tell us\r\nof the wonderfully different flower shapes and colors that are to be\r\nfound along any roadside. The perfect and complete flower that we have\r\nbeen studying is quite regular, composed as often as not of four or five\r\npetals, as many sepals, with five or ten stamens and perhaps a single\r\npistil. Yet there is literally no limit to the variations from this\r\nscheme, and some of these must be understood here in order that the\r\nlife-histories and behavior of plants discussed in later chapters may\r\ntell their full story.\r\n\r\nThe figures on page 44 show a regular flower, with five separate petals\r\nand sepals (Fig. 39). Such flowers are said to be _polypetalous_, i.e.,\r\nseparate petals. Sometimes three of the petals are larger, two smaller,\r\nin which case the flower is lopsided or, as it is said, _inequilateral_.\r\nAgain all the petals are united to form a regular and equilateral tube,\r\nas in lily of the valley, when they are _gamopetalous_, _i.e._, united\r\npetals (Figure 42). As we shall see in the chapter on Plant Families,\r\nthis is a distinction between two great groups of plants, as important\r\nin their classification as negro and white man are in classifying\r\nhumans.\r\n\r\nIn peas, beans, the locust tree, and related plants the petals are much\r\nchanged to form an irregular flower, with a keellike or prow-shaped part\r\nmade from the uniting of two petals. Two more unite to form the wings,\r\nand the remaining and larger petal forms the standard. Figure 40 and the\r\nexplanation under it illustrate this unusual form of flowers.\r\n\r\nOur common garden salvia shows still another type of flower, which is\r\ntubular and irregular (Figure 41). There is an arching, hoodlike\r\nstructure at the top overhanging a lower lip. This kind of irregularity\r\nis common in thousands of different sorts of plants and, usually, it is\r\na device to insure fertilization of the flower by insect visitors. So\r\nnecessary are these for pregnancy in many plants, that an orchid, once\r\ndiscovered in Madagascar with a tube eighteen inches deep, puzzled the\r\nbotanists, who were unable to understand how the plant produced seed in\r\nthe absence of any known insect with a tongue as long as that. Darwin\r\nsaid at once that such an insect would one day be discovered on that\r\nisland. Years after, Baron von Humboldt, a German naturalist, found the\r\ninsect and explained the mystery.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no feature of plant life that shows such an amazing\r\namount of variation as the forms of flowers, and while only a few of the\r\nsimplest deviations from the normal have been discussed here, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that this infinite variety is a reflection of the\r\ningeniousness of nature in securing a plentiful supply of seed. Form,\r\ncolor, the secretion of sweetish nectar, the night or day blooming of\r\ndifferent kinds of flowers, every device that will make fertilization\r\ncertain, by the flower itself, by insects, or even by the wind, is used\r\nin such prodigal fashion, that we come to see the importance of it to\r\nall plants only by a realization of the complexity of it and the\r\nprovisions against its failure.\r\n\r\nOne apparently most lavish method of securing fertilization is the\r\narrangement of flowers in clusters. While many flowers are quite\r\nsolitary, the great mass of individual plants produce a few or dozens,\r\nor even hundreds of flowers--in fact, certain relatives of the common\r\ncarrot may produce over a thousand flowers in a single cluster. The form\r\nand plan of arrangement of these clusters follows a rather definite\r\nscheme, and here, as in the case of leaves and parts of individual\r\nflowers, the figures tell the story better than words. In the common\r\ndandelion and daisy, and their thousands of relatives, the “flower”\r\n(Figures 43-45), as commonly understood, is really composed of scores or\r\neven hundreds of true flowers in each head. In the case of the daisy the\r\nyellow center, if picked apart, is seen to be really made up of scores\r\nof tiny tubular flowers, each just as truly a flower as a single rose.\r\nThe rays, or what are incorrectly called “petals,” which fringe the\r\ngolden center with white, if carefully separated and examined closely,\r\nwill be found to be also a complete flower, the true petals of which are\r\nall joined to make the strap-shaped ray. If one looks sharply, the\r\nunited edges of these petals may be seen by the ridges or channels that\r\nrepresent their joined edges. Because plants of this sort produce two\r\nsets of flowers in each head, one conspicuous by its brightly colored\r\nrays and with another tubular set in the center which makes doubly\r\ncertain the fertilization and seed supply, they are considered the most\r\nhighly developed of all plants. It is not a close aristocracy, nor an\r\nexclusive one, for over eleven thousand different kinds of plants,\r\nscattered all over the world, have their flowers arranged in this\r\nfashion or some slight modification of it. They possess, above all\r\nothers, the certainty that there will be no slip in their fertilization,\r\npregnancy, and subsequent birth of a new generation. Because this is\r\nthe great object of all flowers, and these daisylike plants have brought\r\nit to such perfection, they are most surely to be classed as the highest\r\ntype upon the earth to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 46-50.--TYPES OF FLOWER CLUSTERS\r\n\r\nFig. 46. A spike, the individual flowers attached directly to the common\r\nstalk. Fig. 47. A raceme, a spikelike cluster where individual flowers\r\nare stalked. Fig. 48. An umbel, the individual flower stalks all arising\r\nfrom one point. Fig. 49. Individual flower stalks of different lengths\r\nbut the cluster usually flat-topped (corymb). Fig. 50. A flower cluster\r\nin which the end of the stem is terminated by a flower from the base of\r\nwhich side branchlets similarly tipped with flowers arise (cyme).]\r\n\r\nWhile highly irregular flowers are common in nature, conspicuous\r\nexamples being the orchids in any florist’s window, or the milkweeds\r\nalong the roadside, they can nearly always be seen to have various\r\nchanges in the shape of their petals, or sepals, or stamens, or pistils,\r\nwhich are adaptations to their mode of life, but which always result in\r\nfertilization. Some plants, true monstrosities of nature, are not only\r\nfar from having the usual arrangement of flower parts, but they even\r\nproduce increased numbers of one part at the expense of others.\r\n\r\nDouble buttercups, and hundreds of our most beautiful garden blossoms,\r\nhave been rescued by cultivation or the arts of the gardeners. Some\r\nroses seem to be practically all petals, but for every increase of\r\npetals there must be a decrease of some other part of the flower, and\r\nmore often than enough it is the stamens and pistils that lose out in\r\nthis transformation. Just as there is a decrease almost to the vanishing\r\npoint in the birthrate when people become too effete and cultivated, so\r\nin plants there seems to be a point beyond which they cannot be pushed\r\nwithout suffering partial or often complete inability to produce young.\r\nThe more highly they have been developed, oftentimes the greater their\r\nbeauty, the less able are they to see to it that the chief function of\r\nflowers is accomplished. Such garden plants are increased by root\r\ndivision, cuttings and other arts of the gardener. Naturally true double\r\nflowers are almost unknown in wild plants, and the habit seems to have\r\nbeen brought about by too easy a time of it, too little struggle, too\r\nmuch food, or by any other of those things that produce effete but\r\nbeautiful things, charming in their way, but of no significance in the\r\nsturdy struggle for existence that all wild plants must meet or perish.\r\nAnother curious modification of a flower bud is cauliflower. Here the\r\nbud has been so developed, its calyx, sepals, etc., so transformed that\r\nthe large, cabbagelike head, produced at the apex of the main stem of\r\nthe plant, has by so much lost all semblance of a flower that it is\r\nactually a vegetable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--FLOWER ARRANGEMENT PECULIAR TO THE ARUM FAMILY\r\n\r\nFig. 51. The outer leaflike tubular or hooded spathe surrounds in our\r\ncommon Jack-in-the-Pulpit a clublike spadix, upon which are crowded the\r\ntiny flowers.]\r\n\r\nNo feature of a landscape gives us more pleasure than its flowers, over\r\nwhich poets have sung and artists have painted their most charming\r\npictures, even a musician has composed a very beautiful piano piece, “To\r\na Water Lily.” But their true place in the scheme of nature has a deeper\r\nsignificance: the wonderful color and symmetry of their parts, the plan\r\nof their arrangement, their transformation into curious forms, like the\r\nMadagascar orchid, and hundreds of others--all these point to their\r\nsupreme function, an act of self-sacrifice comparable only to the fall\r\nof a leaf when its task is done. Petals, too, wither and die when the\r\nfertilized ovary, already a mother, begins the slow process of maturing\r\nits young and the end of the flowering stage is reached. Such a climax\r\nis this in certain plants that the whole plant dies, as we have already\r\nnoted in the case of the century plant. The toddy or wine palm of India,\r\noften sixty or seventy years old and more than a hundred feet tall,\r\nflowers only once, and, as if in recognition of the fact that it has\r\ndone that for which it grew, slowly dies as the seed ripens. More humble\r\n_annuals_, like buckwheat, and hundreds of others, live only one brief\r\ngrowing season, produce flowers and seeds, and then die, leaving behind\r\nthem the only means of perpetuating their kind. The dormant seed carries\r\nover the winter the life they were themselves unable to maintain, as\r\nperennials and woody plants do in their buds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRUIT\r\n\r\nThe number of different kinds of fruits that one can buy even in the\r\ngreatest markets in the world is so small, compared to all fruits that\r\nare annually produced by plants, that they might almost be likened to an\r\near of corn as against a Missouri cornfield. If, as we have seen, all\r\nflowering plants must produce fruits, then what we commonly call such\r\ncan be only a fraction of what actually makes up nature’s annual\r\nharvest. It follows that fruits often occur in unfamiliar disguises and,\r\nas we shall see presently, some of the things we have been calling\r\nfruits may be so only partly, if at all.\r\n\r\nDisregarding what we call fruits and looking at it from the plant’s\r\npoint of view, a fruit is anything in which, or upon which, a seed is\r\ndeveloped or ripened quite without regard as to whether it is edible by\r\nman or not. As the ovary is the female organ of reproduction and\r\ncontains the yet undeveloped seed, it follows also that fruits are\r\npractically always a development of some part or modification of the\r\novary or the upper end of the flower stalk upon which it rests and from\r\nwhich it is often scarcely separable.\r\n\r\nFamiliar enough is the distinction between dry fruits, such as a pea pod\r\nand fleshy ones like oranges, and this quality of being fleshy or dry is\r\npractically universal. Among fleshy fruits a few well-known types may be\r\nmentioned, such as the orange, tomato, grape, gooseberry, and cranberry,\r\nall true _berries_. There are, of course, thousands of less familiar\r\nexamples of berries, but, whether with a hard rind as in the orange or\r\nnot, they are a direct development, or often a mere swelling of the\r\novary, with sometimes the adhering calyx, and contain the seed. In\r\napples and pears, known as _pomes_, the fleshy part is a development of\r\npart calyx and part the receptacle upon which the ovary is supported\r\nwhile still in the flower. The ovary in these fruits is the\r\nparchmentlike interior which contains the seed. Plums and cherries,\r\nwhich have a single stone, instead of numerous seeds buried in the\r\nflesh, are known as drupes. These familiar examples are matched by\r\nthousands of others of which we hear nothing, all _drupes_ and all\r\nformed directly from the ripened ovary and without much change, except\r\nthe increase of size, juiciness and large development of the tiny\r\nimmature seed, now transformed into a stone. In the watermelon, pumpkin,\r\nand related plants, is still another kind of fleshy fruit, called a\r\n_pepo_. All of this, including the hard rind, is transformed ovary and\r\ncalyx completely incorporated, and forming in the pumpkin perhaps the\r\nlargest fleshy fruit known. In a considerable number of plants there is\r\nnot a single ovary, but several, or in some cases many. These\r\noccasionally all develop into what is called an aggregate fruit, of\r\nwhich examples are the blackberry, mulberry, magnolia, and many others.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be logical to think that these fleshy fruits were\r\ndesigned to make delicious food for man, that, in the light of what we\r\nhave seen to be the real function of the flower, is an assumption which,\r\nwhile flattering, is far from the truth. It is much more certain that\r\nfleshy fruits help plants in the dispersal of their seeds and that this\r\nfleshy, juicy character is just one more device of nature to see to it\r\nthat not only do plants produce seeds, but that the seeds are carried\r\nand so spread the plant over considerable areas. Birds and animals eat\r\nsuch fruits in enormous quantities and, in fact, bird migrations are\r\nthought to be not so much response to winter cold as to the fact that\r\nfruits are scarce then. When it is remembered that some birds make\r\ntremendous flights, often over 10,000 miles in a few days, their\r\ncapacity to spread seeds through their droppings may be imagined. In the\r\nchapter on plant distribution some truly remarkable cases of such seed\r\ndispersal will be given.\r\n\r\nThe chance of having seed carried great distances, because it is\r\nembedded in a fleshy, often brightly colored fruit, would seem to put\r\nplants having dry fruits at a disadvantage. Birds and animals cannot be\r\nexpected to look after the dispersal of those fruits that are neither\r\ntempting to the sight nor to the taste. And it must be confessed that\r\nquite other qualities in dry fruits insure their dispersal. Some are so\r\nnutritious, like the _acorn_, that thrifty squirrels store them over\r\nthe winter, as they do many other seeds which are harvested from dry\r\nfruits. Various grains are often so stored by man, and rice, wheat,\r\nbuckwheat, and other cereals are common cases. In nearly all grains the\r\nseed fills so completely the fruit that cereals are very generally, but\r\nmistakenly, called seeds. A grain of wheat or corn is just as complete a\r\nfruit as a watermelon. Only its outer coat and inner seed are so closely\r\nwelded together as not to be usually recognized as a fruit, with the\r\nseed inside.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest types of dry fruit is the _capsule_ (Figure 53),\r\nwell named, as it is almost an exact counterpart of the capsule of the\r\ndruggist, in that it is in many cases composed of a lower part and an\r\nupper, usually merely a domed lid. Others again, instead of splitting\r\naround the sides, split from top to bottom. Still others, as peas and\r\nbeans, known as _legumes_ (Figure 57), are pods that not only split\r\nlengthwise, but have no central partition, as do many other fruits of\r\nthe same general type. When the seed is ripe nearly all pods and\r\n_legumes_ finally split open, and the seed or seeds tumble out. A few,\r\nas in the violet and touch-me-not or jewelweed, apparently realizing\r\nthat merely to spill out ripe seeds at the proper time will not spread\r\nthe species very far, open their fruits with a sudden explosion and\r\nliterally shoot their seeds considerable distances. The artillery plant,\r\ncommonly grown in greenhouses, a delicate feathery herb from tropical\r\nAmerica, opens its flowers with a report like a toy popgun and shoots\r\nits small pollen grains for several feet, but not its seeds as stated by\r\nsome.\r\n\r\nBut many fruits do not open at all and seem to be at the greatest\r\ndisadvantage in the effort to insure\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 52-60.--TYPES OF DRY FRUITS\r\n\r\nFig. 52.

Greater food value to birds and animals\r\novercomes this in some kinds, and another help is that some fruits of\r\nthis sort are covered with hooked prickles or barbs (Figures 54 and 60).\r\nThe common weedy burdock, the barbed fruits of which may often be found\r\nsticking to the fur of animals in great quantities, is a case in point.\r\nThere are whole groups of plants that rely on this method for seed\r\ndispersal, notably the avens, tick-seed, tick trefoil, and many shrubs\r\nin the tropical regions.\r\n\r\nWhere the fruits are neither barbed nor very good to eat, and so\r\napparently doomed to be more or less permanent stay-at-homes, nature has\r\nprovided some of them with the proper equipment for flight through the\r\nair. Winged fruits like the maple are to be seen on any windy day during\r\ntheir season scurrying before the breeze, and consequently spreading\r\ntheir kind over considerable distances. In the maple there are two\r\nwings, joined at the base where the seeds are embedded in the wings, and\r\nthe fruit is known as a _samara_ (Figure 58), or key fruit, from a\r\nslight resemblance to an old-fashioned key. Ash trees bear fruits that\r\nare a slight modification of this type and may be carried considerable\r\ndistances by the wind (Figure 59).\r\n\r\nIn the dandelion, daisy, and nearly all its thousands of relatives, this\r\nfaculty of setting sail in the air has been carried to the greatest\r\nperfection, just as we saw its flowers were. In this family of plants,\r\nthe largest in the world, the fruit is mostly tipped or surrounded by a\r\nsmall collection of very fine bristles. The fruit, known as an _achene_\r\n(Figure 56), is so light that with the added buoyancy of this tiny\r\ncollection of down it can be transported great distances. Some have\r\nbeen known to fly hundreds of miles in severe storms, and, as we shall\r\nsee in the chapter on plant distribution, these tiny plant balloons have\r\nplayed a conspicuous part in spreading their kind over the face of the\r\nearth. Cat-tails also, together with many other plants, have this\r\nfaculty and make up by its possession for the lack of fleshy or\r\notherwise desirable fruits that might be carried. All _achenes_ are not\r\nwinged, those which dot the surface of the strawberry being imbedded in\r\nthe luscious flesh, which is not really fruit at all. Only the achenes\r\non the strawberry are true fruits, the fleshy part being merely a\r\ndevelopment of the upper part of the flower stalk and not of the ovary\r\n(Figure 52).\r\n\r\nFruits, then, cannot be restricted to the common understanding of them.\r\nThey are transformations of the ovary, in which or upon which seeds are\r\nnursed, and upon which most plants depend for the dispersal of their\r\nseeds. We shall see later on how fruits have fulfilled their destiny,\r\nhow some are fit for their true function only when they have been eaten\r\nby birds, and when some digestive juice has released them from the\r\nimpotence they would suffer without being eaten, how a whole forest has\r\nbeen changed in the West by the busy activity of squirrels upon the\r\nfruits and seeds of a single kind of fir tree; how the fruit of the\r\ncoconut palm has been spread throughout the tropical world because it\r\ncan float in the sea securely protected from injury from salt by the\r\nimpervious coverings of its fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEED\r\n\r\nAs the final stage in the development of all plants is their seed, with\r\nthe dropping of which they bid good-by to their fellows, it is not\r\nperhaps remarkable that in the seed of all flowering plants is the germ\r\nfor the new generation. To seeds which may be as small as the mustard,\r\nso often mentioned in the Bible, or as large as the coco de mer, or\r\ndouble coconut, from the Seychelles Islands, often fifty pounds or over,\r\nis intrusted by cunning nature the one final and most important act in\r\nthe whole kingdom of the plant world. Nearly all plants would die off\r\nforever if seeds did not have in them the germ of life, apparently quite\r\ndead, but actually only dormant. This living germ may persist for years,\r\nsometimes even a hundred years, and yet with the proper conditions it\r\nnever fails to sprout.\r\n\r\nSeeds have inside them a tiny plantlet folded and ready to grow when the\r\nseed splits to release it. Also, in the seed is stored up food to\r\nsustain the new plant until such time as its own roots begin to act.\r\nThis young plantlet is known as the _embryo_, and to this all actions of\r\nthe seed are subservient.\r\n\r\nAs the seed splits, and the young plant develops its first leaves and\r\nrootlets, there is shown one of the most remarkably uniform tendencies\r\nin plant life. In all plants with net-veined leaves the young plantlet\r\nstarts life with two leaves, or _cotyledons_, as these first leaves are\r\ncalled, and this whole group of plants are thus known as _dicotyledons_.\r\nIn plants with parallel-veined leaves the young plantlets start out with\r\na single cotyledon and are therefore called _monocotyledons_. In only\r\nthe pines, spruce, and a few other evergreen trees the seedling plants\r\nhave several cotyledons and are known as _polycotyledons_. All the\r\nflowering plants in the world belong to one of these groups, so that\r\nmerely to see the germinating seed tells the story at once. The linking\r\nof parallel-veined leaves and a single seed leaf, and net-veined leaves\r\nwith two seed leaves, is also associated with very definite arrangement\r\nof their flower parts, their method of growth and other characters.\r\nSomething has already been said of this in the discussion of stems and\r\nleaves, and more will be found in the chapter on plant families. No more\r\nbeautiful example of the plan or scheme of nature is to be found than\r\nthese characteristics of all plants, and in seeds we find the first hint\r\nas to which army the plant will join, under which banner it will fight,\r\nand under what generalship it will develop. Nothing tells us so much as\r\nthese first seed leaves, pushing their way up through the soil and\r\nrevealing, as they burst above ground, to what place in nature their\r\ndestiny will consign them.\r\n\r\nFlowering plants, which make up the bulk of the vegetation of the earth,\r\nhave been discussed in some detail, not only because they furnish us\r\nwith all the things that make life possible, but also because they show\r\nperhaps better than anything else the division of labor, all striving\r\nfor one end. Roots, the food gatherers. Stems, the framework for the\r\nfoliage and its means of reaching the light, or as a storage house for\r\nreserve food. Leaves of many kinds, all factories working night and day\r\nto make the necessary food. Flowers of every hue and shape to lure\r\ninsects, or by other means secure union of male and female. Fruits to\r\nripen the result of this mating of the sexes. And, finally, the seed\r\ncarrying with it the yet unborn life. Each part occasionally losing\r\nitself in order that the end may be accomplished, many of them changing\r\ntheir form or even their function where that is of advantage, all in\r\ntheir separate ways doing their task, the end of which they cannot see,\r\nand the fruits of which they will never enjoy. Nowhere is it so true as\r\nin plants that to save oneself there must be the capacity to give\r\noneself. Untold millions of leaves fall, or trees crash down, or seeds\r\nare developed, each fulfilling their destiny which is to insure the\r\nperpetuation of their kind. As we shall see later on, there are many\r\nmistakes, many apparently futile attempts, thousands are wiped out that\r\none may be saved, and in the past multitudes have gone out forever. Yet\r\nthe result of it all is the plant world as we know it to-day, each kind\r\nstruggling to increase its sphere of influence, or to cover more of the\r\nearth’s area. The combat between different kinds is inexorable, yet the\r\ncapacity for sacrifice on the part of different organs, in order that a\r\ncertain individual kind may win, is literally beyond belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. FLOWERLESS PLANTS\r\n\r\nIn the light of what has been said about flowers it may well be\r\nquestioned how anything can be a plant and still have no flower. The\r\nfact is that flowers as we commonly understand them are unknown in the\r\nplants about to be discussed, but that what _corresponds_ to a flower,\r\nand performs the _function_ of a flower all plants must and do have. In\r\nthe case of most flowering plants the possession of flowers is one of\r\nthe beauties of nature in its most resplendent mood, while in the\r\nso-called flowerless plants the functions of flowers are performed by\r\ntiny microscopic organs, even the existence of which has been only\r\nrecently discovered. Because flowering plants produce their sexual\r\norgans in such a gorgeous setting, for all the world to see their\r\nmatings they have been called _phanerogams_, which means literally\r\nvisible marriage, while the flowerless plants which perform similar\r\nfunctions in more secret ways are called _cryptogams_, meaning hidden\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThese _cryptogams_ or flowerless plants occur in far greater numbers in\r\nthe world than flowering plants, but their size in most cases is very\r\nmuch less. Many individuals are so small, as in the case of bacteria,\r\nthat a single one can only be seen after it has been magnified many\r\nhundreds of times by the microscope. Of the cryptogams some of the\r\nlargest, certainly the most beautiful, and probably the best known are\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FERNS\r\n\r\nIn nearly all woods one may find delicate feathery plants with graceful,\r\nusually much divided leaves that nearly always start up from the ground\r\nlike a slowly opening, but somewhat fuzzy coil. (Figure 62.) Ferns, at\r\nleast most of those that grow in America, uncoil their leaves in this\r\nway, almost without exception. The accompanying figure shows the\r\nprocedure, and in addition to this character one may hunt in vain for\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nWhile they bear no flowers we already know that nature could not leave\r\nthem with no means of reproduction without abandoning them to a\r\nchildless old age and the consequent extinction of the race of ferns. So\r\nfar from the truth is this that ferns make up a goodly proportion of the\r\nworld’s vegetation, and there are many hundreds of different kinds\r\nknown. The lack of flowers, of course, explains why ferns do not bear\r\nseeds which are matured in a fruit or ripened ovary.\r\n\r\nOn the back of the leaves of most ferns, along or near the edges of the\r\nfiner subdivisions, one may\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 61-63.--COMMON WOODLAND FERN\r\n\r\nFig. 61. A general view. Fig. 62. Its uncoiling spring condition. Fig.\r\n63. The back of one of the smaller divisions of the leaf showing the\r\ncollection of spore cases (sori). These are sometimes borne on special\r\nleaves, but in most of our American kinds on the backs of ordinary\r\nfoliage leaves.]\r\n\r\nfind, at the proper season, collections or rows of tiny, usually\r\nbrownish dots. These contain often thousands of microscopic objects\r\nknown generally as _spores_, and from this fact the dots are called\r\nspore-cases, or more technically _sori_. (Figure 63.) The process by\r\nwhich new plants are formed is a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AERIAL ROOTS OF FIG TREES HANGING OVER THE EDGE OF A CAVE\r\nIN THE RAIN FOREST, SAN LORENZO, SANTO DOMINGO.

The fringed valves of its leaves close\r\ntogether when an insect alights between them. (_Courtesy of Brooklyn\r\nBotanic Garden._)]\r\n\r\nsomewhat complicated one, but the spores in these brown dots are the\r\nagency which makes reproduction possible, and the actual mechanism of\r\nit, one of the most interesting achievements in plant life, will be\r\ndescribed in the chapter on “How Plants Produce Their Young.” Sometimes\r\nthe spores are not borne on the backs of ordinary foliage leaves but on\r\nspecial leaves that bear, very often, nothing else.\r\n\r\nFerns are much like ordinary flowering plants; except for their lack of\r\nflowers, they have all the root, stem, and leaf characters of their more\r\nshowy neighbors. While most of them have compound leaves, even sometimes\r\ntwice or thrice compounded, a few have simple, narrow leaves without\r\nteeth, and one kind in tropical America has threadlike leaves. In many\r\ntropical rain forests, so called from their dripping wet condition,\r\nferns form large trees, and these tree ferns are among the most graceful\r\nand feathery of all plants. There are, too, a few climbing kinds--one,\r\ncalled the climbing fern, is a native of the eastern United States. Then\r\nthere is the walking fern, that seems to upset the statement that plants\r\ndo not move as animals do. It sends out delicate runners that, rooting\r\nat the tips, form new plants, often several feet from the parent plant.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of having, even in the simplest form, stems, leaves,\r\nand roots, with all that this implies in their internal structure, marks\r\nthem off at once from all other flowerless plants. In ferns there is\r\nalways some internal equipment for carrying food from one part of the\r\nplant, the roots, to another, and this ability is possessed by virtue of\r\nducts or vessels through the stem and leaves. This system, found in all\r\nflowering plants and ferns, but _nowhere else in the plant world_, is\r\ncalled the _vascular system_, or literally, a vessel system. We shall\r\nsee how important was the acquirement of this system of vessels, when we\r\nget to the chapter on the History of the Plant Kingdom. Its appearance\r\nupon the earth marks as important a stage in the development of plants\r\nas the dawn of a definite backbone did upon animal life.\r\n\r\nFerns, then, are _vascular cryptogams_ because they do have conducting\r\nvessels in their stems, and they produce their young by a process of\r\nhidden marriage which will be described later. All other cryptogams or\r\nflowerless plants are without this system of vessels and are called\r\ntherefore _non-vascular cryptogams_. Numerically they are tremendously\r\nimportant; upon them depend many manufacturing processes like bread\r\nmaking, brewing, and all arts using fermentation. But they are hardly\r\nrecognized as plants by the general reader, and because of their size\r\nand the necessity of studying them with a microscope in order to\r\nunderstand their structure they will be treated here only briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER FLOWERLESS PLANTS\r\n\r\nThe remaining flowerless plants, having no duct system in their make-up,\r\nare, as we know, called _non-vascular cryptogams_. This is a general\r\nterm for a very large group of plants, some quite obvious and well known\r\nlike a mushroom, for instance; others so small or of such uncertain\r\nstructure that they are not even well known by experts. This great mass\r\nof plant life, more numerous than all the other kinds of plants\r\ncombined, contains many different forms, some of which are of gigantic\r\nsize. A single plant of a certain Pacific Coast seaweed regularly\r\nexceeds in length the height of the tallest\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 64-67.--TYPES OF FLOWERLESS PLANTS\r\n\r\nFig. 64. A moss plant. Fig. 65. A mushroom, a common type of the fungi,\r\nwhich include also puffballs, molds, and many disease-causing\r\nmicroscopic organisms. Fig. 66. A common seaweed, a representative of\r\nthe algæ, which include the green scum on the top of ponds, and the kelp\r\nfrom which fertilizer is now being made. Fig. 67. A lichen, a common\r\ncryptogamous plant on logs and rocks. Our native kinds are usually\r\ngrayish-green in color.]\r\n\r\nknown trees. And yet other inhabitants of the water, certain kinds that\r\nfloat freely, are microscopic in size. The latter occur in such enormous\r\nnumbers that their tiny decomposed skeletons after dropping to the\r\nbottom of the sea form the diatomaceous earth, so much used in polishing\r\nmachinery. The commercial product now comes from deposits of these\r\nskeletons laid down in past ages, which, due to changes in the land and\r\nwater surfaces of the earth, are now found in Virginia, Nevada,\r\nCalifornia, and in Bohemia. All these must have been in the bed of\r\nwaters long since gone, which teemed with these microscopic organisms.\r\nTo-day there are over ten thousand different kinds known, yet so small\r\nare they that their dimensions are measured in thousandths of an inch!\r\n\r\nSomewhat lower in the scale of life--and by this we mean simpler in\r\nstructure--than the ferns are the _mosses_. (Figure 64.) There are\r\nthousands of different kinds, but everyone is familiar with the\r\ncollective growth of the commoner sorts which makes the velvety mossy\r\ncarpet in our woods. The individual plants are small, but in many kinds\r\nsufficiently large to be seen without a microscope. Most important of\r\nall, practically every one of them has the ordinary green color of the\r\nbetter known plants, and as we shall see in the section devoted to\r\n“Leaves as Factories for the Making of Food,” that stamps them at once\r\nas plants, if other things did not.\r\n\r\nMosses are almost infinite in their habits, some growing on the dry\r\nrocks or trunks of trees, many growing in moist woods, some in the\r\nwater, and immense quantities of certain kinds in bogs. The peculiar bog\r\nmosses, known as sphagnum, play an important part in forming peat and\r\nperhaps coal. While mosses are otherwise not of much commercial\r\nimportance, they are among nature’s most beautiful ground covers,\r\ncarpeting many a nook and dell with a soft, velvety, almost cushionlike\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are rather small, they appear to have a somewhat definite\r\nstem and tiny leaflike appendages of it, without, however, having the\r\nvascular system found in all ferns. Mosses might almost be considered\r\nminiature ferns, of which they are perhaps only simple ancestors. Their\r\nvegetative or green parts vary much in shape, size, and the arrangement\r\nof the tiny leaflike appendages, and while most of them are a beautiful\r\nbright green, nearly all the bog or sphagnum mosses are rather ashy gray\r\nin color. In most of the typical mosses there arises from among the\r\nvegetative growth of them a slender stalk, at the top of which is a\r\nsmall capsulelike organ. This contains the spores, and it is upon this\r\nlong slender stalk and its spore-filled capsule, really marvelous in its\r\ninternal structure and mechanism for the discharge of the spores, that\r\nmosses depend for their reproduction. As in the case of the ferns this\r\nprocess will be considered later, along with that of some other plants.\r\nThis whole story of how plants produce their young, perhaps the most\r\nfascinating of any part of the study of plant life, is so fundamentally\r\na part of their history and shows nature in her most maternal moods,\r\nthat a special chapter will be devoted to it. There we shall see, as a\r\nwhole, how these vastly different acts of fertilization and reproduction\r\nare, in different groups of plants, all responses to that insistent\r\ncommand for life, more life, in a never-ending stream.\r\n\r\nThe chief characters to remember about mosses are that they are very\r\nsimple, but practically always green plants that have some\r\ndifferentiation into stem and leaf; that, while they have no vascular\r\nsystem, their structure and particularly the mode of reproduction\r\nsuggests that they are not very distant from the ferns, and quite likely\r\nsimple ancestors of them. These characters are of more importance than\r\nappears on the surface, as we shall presently see, for they mark mosses\r\noff from many other nonvascular flowerless plants which have quite\r\ndifferent structure and altogether different mode of life.\r\n\r\nIf you will turn to the chapter on Plant Behavior and read particularly\r\nthe sections on “Leaves as Factories for the Manufacture of Food” and\r\n“Borrowing from the Living and Robbing from the Dead,” you will see in\r\nthe food habits of the plants there noted the great difference that\r\nexists between plants, like mosses and ferns, that have green coloring\r\nmatter in them, and those we are about to mention that never do. The\r\nlack of this green coloring substance tells us at once that plants of\r\nthis sort live only on the dead remains of other plants. In the case of\r\nthese nonvascular flowerless plants there are certain modes of growth\r\nthat, in some forms at least, are always associated with this\r\nscavenger-like food habit.\r\n\r\nThe common mushroom (Figure 65) is the best known of that large group of\r\nplants, called generally fungi, which produce no green coloring matter,\r\nhave no leaves attached to a stem, and _always_ live on decayed\r\nvegetable, or sometimes inhabit living animals, even man himself. The\r\nmushroom with its brownish stalk and buttonlike dome is familiar enough,\r\nbut there are literally thousands of different kinds, a common sort\r\nforming “brackets” on the trunks of trees. While perhaps everyone would\r\nrecognize these as plants, peculiar as they are in their often weird\r\nshapes and unusual as they nearly always are in their color, there are\r\nmany minute kinds of fungi that scarcely anyone would even think of as a\r\nplant, and yet for better or worse they are incomparably the most\r\npowerful plants in the world. For upon these microscopic fungi man\r\ndepends for many things. It is certain kinds of them that make the\r\nmanufacture of cheese possible. They turn milk sour (pasteurizing milk\r\nis merely stopping their work), give to yeast its power of “raising”\r\nbread, all brewing depends upon them, every process of fermenting the\r\njuice of fruits for wine making or for whatever else, the decay of\r\nwood--all these processes and scores of others, whether for the good or\r\nevil of mankind, depend upon the work of these plants, any one of which\r\nis so small that a single individual must be magnified hundreds of times\r\nto detect it. Many of them are the “germs”--better called bacteria--that\r\ncause diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, anthrax, and\r\ndiphtheria. All surgeons wage incessant warfare against a host of them\r\nthat attack wounds and form pus. They live in our intestines and have\r\nmuch to do with digestion, and unhappily with indigestion, so that we\r\nmay be said to carry about with us a whole flora of them! Nearly all the\r\ndiseases of plants, like the blight of potato and the rust on wheat, are\r\ncaused by them. Some other kinds live in the soil, and many flowering\r\nplants depend absolutely for getting their food upon the work of these\r\nfungi. Unfortunately their minute size and consequently obscure mode of\r\nlife demand technical skill and the use of the microscope to detect\r\nthem, so we must leave them here, always keeping in mind that these\r\nsmallest of all plants are charged with a power for good or evil; so far\r\nas man’s life is concerned, greater perhaps than all other plants.\r\n\r\nWhile most fungi, particularly those familiar ones like mushrooms and\r\npuffballs, are inhabitants of the land, the remaining group of\r\nnonvascular flowerless plants are nearly all water plants. Most of the\r\nbetter known ones live in the sea, and as the wrack or tangle washed up\r\non the shore we recognize them as seaweed. The _algæ_ (Figure 66), which\r\nis a general name for such plants--and they live in the sea, in fresh\r\nwater, and even on dry land--are, so far as structure is concerned, the\r\nsimplest of all plants.\r\n\r\nThose that are fastened to rocks are often beautifully colored, much\r\nbranched, and many kinds bear small bladders that act as buoys. These\r\ncoast seaweeds are generally of different colors, those nearest the\r\nsurface being generally greenish, the deeper water kinds reddish or\r\nbrown. None of these seaweeds are found at great depths, because the\r\nreally deep parts of the ocean are almost, if not quite, dark. Seaweeds,\r\nand in fact all the algæ, have green coloring matter in them, even where\r\nthis is masked by reds and browns, as is the case in some particularly\r\nshowy kinds. As you will find in the section on “Leaves as Factories for\r\nthe Making of Food,” no plant with green coloring matter can live in the\r\ndark. That is why seaweeds are not found in the great deeps of the sea,\r\nsome of which are several miles below the shore line along the coasts,\r\nand are so cold and dark that neither plants nor animals can grow in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThose seaweeds that grow along the coast, and are uncovered by the\r\nretreating tides, are well known by everyone, but by far the greater\r\nnumber of algæ float without anchorage of any kind. One kind that has\r\nbeen torn from its anchorage occurs in such enormous quantities that off\r\nthe coast of America it has formed literally a floating island composed\r\nentirely of dense mats of a species of seaweed. This place, known as\r\nthe “Sargasso Sea” from the name of the seaweed forming it, was the\r\nterror of old mariners and Columbus’s ship was fouled in it for two\r\nweeks. The area occupied by the weed is several hundred miles long and\r\nwide, and while old sea yarns about ships being caught in it and never\r\nescaping are gross exaggerations, it is certainly one of the most\r\ncurious of plant growths, due entirely to a nonvascular cryptogam.\r\n\r\nOf those kinds that are never anchored the number is legion, and in\r\naddition to those forming the diatomaceous earth, already mentioned,\r\nthere are many more. They form almost the only food of hosts of\r\ncreatures of the sea, but because of their floating freely in the water,\r\nthe consequent difficulty of collecting them, and their unusually minute\r\nsize, little is likely to be known of them, except by the experts.\r\n\r\nOther algæ are always found in fresh water and form the scum found on\r\nstagnant pools. Individuals of any of these are so minute that, while\r\nunder the microscope they are of the greatest beauty, their structure\r\nmust remain for most of us a sealed book.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF WHAT PLANTS ARE\r\n\r\nWe have now traced, in only the briefest fashion, the outlines of what\r\nplants are, reversing the order of nature in beginning with those most\r\ncomplex but best known, the flowering plants. As we shall see later,\r\nthese are the climax of prodigal nature and are to be considered the end\r\nrather than the beginning of plant life on the earth. Then, and still\r\nmore briefly, have we stopped to see those less known plants that\r\nproduce no flowers, such as the ferns, mosses, fungi, and finally the\r\nseaweeds or algæ. These are all to be considered as the ancestors of\r\nflowering plants, the ferns the nearest to them and the algæ probably\r\nthe most distant relatives. The development of plants from the minutest\r\nalga up to our most gorgeous flowering plant, is an infinitely slow and\r\npainful process. With many mistakes, with its pathway strewn with the\r\nwreckage of forlorn hopes and false starts, it is incomparably the most\r\ndramatic story in the plant world. Some of its details will be told in\r\nthe chapter on the “History of the Plant Kingdom.”\r\n\r\nNor can we leave the discussion of what plants are without some mention\r\nof the thing that really makes up their structure, whether it be a\r\nmicroscopic bacterial organism or the Big Tree of California. For the\r\nunit of all animal and plant life is the _cell_. In its simplest form it\r\nis merely a minute sac with a definite wall and inside the wall is a\r\nsubstance known as _protoplasm_, literally _protos_, first, and\r\n_plasma_, thing formed. It is protoplasm that forms the living tissue of\r\nall plants and animals; it is life itself. No one has ever succeeded in\r\nmaking any, notwithstanding that many learned men have tried for years.\r\nIts inclosure in the cell wall, its power of self-division and\r\nconsequent multiplication of the units, make up those first things about\r\nwhich most of us can never know much, but the end of which we recognize\r\nin the beauty of plant life all about us. For only under the highest\r\npowers of the microscope may cells be seen and studied. Just as bankers\r\nreckon mills as a definite unit of a cent, and yet none of them has ever\r\nseen a mill, so we must think of cells as the definite unit of all\r\nliving things, although most of us will never see a cell. But, unlike\r\nthe mill, cells may be seen by those equipped to see them, and this\r\nstudy, the development and grouping of them to form all the varied\r\nobjects that inhabit the plant world, is known as _histology_. It is\r\nliterally the internal history of plants and animals, and lies quite\r\noutside the scope of this book. What we must never forget is that\r\nwhatever knowledge we have gained, either from the foregoing account of\r\nwhat plants are, or from our observation of them, is, after all, only a\r\npartial notion of them, as unsatisfactory as our estimate of what people\r\nreally are, from merely looking at the outside of the houses in which\r\nthey live. The outer form we may know and admire, the inner substance\r\nmust ever remain for most of us a secret treasure house the value of\r\nwhich is certain, but the key to which we do not possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPLANT BEHAVIOR\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LIGHT AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nPractically all that has been said in the first chapter relates to what\r\nplants are, their organs, or what we may call the architecture or plan\r\nof their framework. But what they do with this elaborate structure is as\r\nimportant as what we do with a house that may contain every modern\r\nimprovement but is never a home until these things have been put to use.\r\nOne of the chief concerns of any architect is to see to it that the\r\nhouse has as much sunshine by day and as attractive illumination by\r\nnight as possible. Nature, that greatest of all architects, also sees to\r\nit that plants get the utmost necessary sunlight, but for a much more\r\nimportant reason than the mere attractiveness of sunshine, be that ever\r\nso beautiful. For light, the life-giver of all green things, is so\r\nabsolutely essential to plants that experiments to grow them in the dark\r\nhave always failed, and many gardeners now use electric light in\r\ngreenhouses in order to prolong the short daylight of winter. It is the\r\nlack of light that makes celery blanch.\r\n\r\nPlants grown in the house inevitably turn toward the windows, even\r\nplants growing against a wall turn their leaves away from it--nowhere\r\ncan one find living green things that do not find the light as surely\r\nand persistently as men try to get their food or their mates. Many\r\nexamples of this could be given and must have been noticed by everyone.\r\n\r\nSometimes seeds germinate under a barn floor for instance, and the puny\r\npale little plantling reaches out slender stems, all of which turn, as a\r\ncompass turns to the north, to perhaps a crack of light in one corner of\r\nthe building. We have already seen how the search for light will carry\r\nthe slender rattan palms of India hundreds of feet to the topmost leaves\r\nof the forest. Individual plants, and, as we shall see later, whole\r\nforests make desperate efforts to get to the light. We know already,\r\nthat the struggle for light is just as bitter as the struggle for food\r\nby roots. And finally if, as we have many times proved by experiments,\r\nplants die when grown in a dark room, what is it that light does for\r\nplants and how is a process carried on that everything leads us to think\r\nis of the greatest possible importance? Quite obviously it is not the\r\nmere beauty of sunshine dancing upon the landscape, as entrancing a\r\npicture as that may be any summer afternoon, with the play of sunshine\r\nand shadow on the tracery of foliage. That green color of the foliage,\r\nthe almost universal green of so much of the earth’s vegetation, restful\r\nto tired eyes, providing us with the most pleasant shade, has wrapped up\r\nwithin it the secret of just what sunshine does for plants. For under\r\nthe magic of light acting upon this greenery one of the most important\r\nindustries in the world, the manufacture of food, is constantly going\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAVES AS FACTORIES FOR THE MAKING OF FOOD\r\n\r\nIt must be clear enough from the start that to call a leaf a factory for\r\nthe making of food forces us to decide at once whether this is a mere\r\nway of speaking, or whether, incredible as it may seem, anything as\r\nthin as a leaf _can_ really produce food. As we eat lettuce, and\r\nmillions of cattle graze every day, leaves as food producers win handily\r\non that score. But to understand how food is produced in such a tiny\r\nfactory demands that we walk about in it for a bit, study the inside of\r\nit and especially its many small chambers within which is not only the\r\nmachinery, but some of the finished product stored up for later use.\r\n\r\nUnlike modern factories there are many entrances, from any one of which\r\nwe can begin our tour of inspection. On the under side of nearly all\r\nleaves and on the upper side of some there are scores or even hundreds\r\nof small pores called _stoma_, so small that only with a microscope can\r\nthey be seen. These entrances through the factory wall, are carefully\r\nguarded by a pair of watchmen whose business it is to see neither too\r\nmuch dry air gets in nor too much of the product of the factory gets\r\nout. They see to it, also, that waste products are thrown out at the\r\nproper time. These watchmen, or _guard cells_, as they are called, are\r\nconstantly on the job, work almost automatically, but their chief\r\nfunction is connected with the proper ventilation of the place, and will\r\nbe discussed later under “How Plants Breathe.”\r\n\r\nOnce past the entrance it is obvious that we are in one of the strangest\r\nof all factories, for none of the rooms are truly square or oblong and\r\ntheir irregularity as to outline would drive your average foreman into\r\nprofanity. Yet they are certainly divided into distinct classes, at\r\nleast as to size and as to what the rooms contain. Some are apparently\r\nfilled with nothing but air and have direct connection through the stoma\r\nwith the outdoors. These are called _intercellular spaces_. Others, and\r\nthese are most important, are filled mostly with the green coloring\r\nmatter that gives the leaf its color. This substance is known as\r\n_chlorophyll_, its individual units as _chloroplasts_, or literally,\r\nchlorophyll bodies. Quite independently of these chlorophyll cells or\r\nrooms, or the intercellular spaces which correspond to halls, there are\r\nsome large and many small tubes. These are the veins of the leaf and\r\ntheir finer branches and by their direct connection through the stem to\r\nthe roots, serve as the ducts through which some of the raw materials\r\nare brought into the factory.\r\n\r\nThis green coloring matter or chlorophyll is perhaps the most important\r\nsubstance in nature. Without it all except a very few plants would die,\r\nand even in those beautifully colored leaves like coleus or caladium\r\nchlorophyll is always found, but in these colored leaves it is merely\r\nobscured by other coloring substances. It is in the chlorophyll that the\r\nability resides to take the inorganic substances through the roots or\r\nfrom the air, and by the aid of sunlight transform them into organic\r\nsubstances like starch and sugar. Nothing else in all nature can do it;\r\nwithout this faculty, which the commonest green leaf possesses, the\r\nearth would prove uninhabitable within a single year. Just what\r\nchlorophyll is chemically is not yet thoroughly known, but the thing of\r\nchief interest is that it is hardly ever found in parts of the leaf not\r\nexposed directly to the sunlight, and that during the autumnal coloring\r\nand before the fall of the leaf chlorophyll is carried to other parts of\r\nthe plant, and quite possibly stored for use the following season.\r\n\r\nWhile the composition of chlorophyll is not surely known, iron is\r\ncertainly one of its constituents, as plants deprived of iron lose\r\ntheir green color. It also is known to contain oxygen, carbon, hydrogen,\r\nand nitrogen, but merely to catalog what we know about its make-up does\r\nnot tell us that it is a living green substance and that sunshine sets\r\nit in motion. Just exactly how light acts on chlorophyll no one really\r\nknows; we merely know that it does so act and that the result is one of\r\nthe marvelous secret processes of nature, perhaps like the secret of\r\nlife itself forever hidden from man. In our tiny factory, then, we have\r\nraw products coming from the roots and through the stoma from the air;\r\nmachinery of the most efficient type, for chlorophyll works night and\r\nday, and constantly renews itself while producing the finished products;\r\nenergy from the sun; and finally the complete manufactured products\r\nwhich are foods in the shape of starch and sugar. During the growing\r\nseason there is no banking of the fires, no stoppage of this most\r\nimportant of all industries, no strikes or lockouts. Each part of the\r\nwhole works smoothly and with the nicest precision--in fact so perfectly\r\ndoes this process keep on going, so complete is the orderliness of the\r\nplace, and so regular are the completed products turned out, that no\r\nmodern factory manager or workman but can learn something from a rather\r\nclose study of this smallest but most efficient factory in the world.\r\n\r\nSome of the raw products are delivered to the leaf from the roots where\r\nthey have been absorbed by another process that will be considered a\r\nlittle later. These consist of water and the inorganic substances\r\ndissolved in it, popularly called sap. Carbon and oxygen come mostly\r\nfrom the air, sometimes separately, more often in the form of a\r\ncombination called carbon dioxide which is one of the chief\r\nconstituents of the gas thrown off by man as he breathes _out_. Now\r\nthese inorganic substances, contained in the sap or derived from the\r\nair, are literally mixed by the chlorophyll and form, always with the\r\naid of sunlight, substances known as _carbohydrates_, the commonest\r\nexample of which is sugar. Some form of sugar is one of the earliest\r\nresults of this process, but sugar is quite easily dissolved in the sap\r\nwhich has contributed to its manufacture, and the excess sugar is thus\r\nremoved. Otherwise it would clog the machinery and prevent the\r\nproduction of fresh supplies. This first step in the manufacturing\r\nprocess has not inaptly been called _photosynthesis_, the meaning of\r\nwhich _photos_, light, and _synthesis_, combining by means of, suggests\r\nin a word the necessity of light and the combination of the inorganic\r\nsubstances mentioned above. Of course this process of photosynthesis is\r\nnot as simple as the brief account of it suggests, for it is actually a\r\ncomplicated chemical process only part of which is yet understood. It is\r\nfairly certain that it goes step by step; it is quite certain that the\r\nbeginning is inorganic and the end organic compounds like sugar.\r\nSomething is known also of the wear and tear on the chlorophyll, its\r\nwaste products, and how it keeps itself not only fit but provides for\r\nits own constant renewal. One of the excess or by-products in this\r\ninitial manufacture of sugar is oxygen. This is either used in other\r\nways by the plant, or more generally it is thrown off through the stoma\r\ninto the outer air. Oxygen, as one of the necessary constituents of the\r\nair that man breathes _in_, is thus thrown off, while, as we have seen,\r\ncarbon dioxide, a poisonous gas which we breathe _out_, is a necessity\r\nfor this manufacturing process in all green plants. Hardly any trick of\r\nnature so completely fulfills the wants of animal and plant life as this\r\nmutual exchange of by-products--in the case of animals it is the waste\r\nof respiration, in plants it is the wastage of sugar making and some\r\nother changes that go on in the plant just after this stage.\r\n\r\nThe amount of sugar made, carbon dioxide taken in, and oxygen given off\r\nby this process suggests that while leaves may be very tiny factories\r\nthey are among the most efficient in the world. Assuming an area of leaf\r\nsurface equal to about a square yard the amount of sugar made would be\r\nabout one-third of an ounce in a day or nearly three pounds in a single\r\ngrowing season. Carbon dioxide withdrawn from the air would average from\r\nthe same area of leaf surface about two gallons a day or over three\r\nhundred gallons for the season. As an equal amount of oxygen is given\r\noff by the leaf, it becomes clear that as all of this interchange must\r\ngo through the stoma the functioning of these and their guardians must\r\nbe nearly one hundred per cent perfect. As we shall see a little later,\r\nthey perform still other duties with even greater perfection. When we\r\nstop to reflect what an absurdly minute fraction one square yard of leaf\r\nsurface is to the total leaf surface in the world, we come to some\r\nrealization of the gigantic proportions of this process of manufacturing\r\nsugar and exchange of gases mutually useful to animals and plants. While\r\nin the United States most of the leaves fall in the autumn, the great\r\nbulk of the vegetation of the world holds the greater part of its leaves\r\nall the year, notably in the vast evergreen forests in the north, and of\r\ncourse practically all tropical vegetation. Chlorophyll in such places\r\nworks continually and what the total of sugar production may be no man\r\ncan even guess.\r\n\r\nSugar, although the first step in the process, is not the final one, and\r\nthe leaf has still other tasks to complete. Some of the sugar is used up\r\nin the process of renewing the chlorophyll, some of it is moved to other\r\nparts of the plant where in sugar cane it forms the world’s chief sugar\r\nsupply; but the remainder is transformed into starch, a substance that\r\nis not dissolved by the water of the sap, and is therefore capable of\r\npermanent storage either in the leaf itself or in other parts of the\r\nplant, notably in the tubers of the potato, the solid part of which is\r\nnearly all starch. The conversion of sugar to starch, which is really a\r\nmeans of contriving to properly store the product of the factory, is\r\ndone by certain ferments known as enzymes. Just what enzymes are or even\r\nhow they work is not well known, but apparently they have the faculty of\r\nconverting certain substances like sugar, and in the process they\r\nneither use up nor materially change their own composition. It is\r\ncertain that the conversion of sugar to starch is an elaborate chemical\r\nprocess, but it is accomplished by these enzymes, the very existence of\r\nwhich has only recently been discovered. Enzymes not only do this, but\r\nthey convert starch which is insoluble into a kind that may be dissolved\r\nand thus carried to different parts of the plant. Upon this power\r\ndepends the storage of starch in roots, tubers, seeds, or wherever else\r\nit is found in the plant, and it is of course upon this power man\r\ndepends for the food supply of the world. Wheat or corn, potatoes, rice,\r\nall the foods that are rich in starch produce none in that part of the\r\nplant harvested by man. All of it has come by the process which is only\r\nsketched in its briefest outlines in the foregoing paragraphs. All of it\r\nmust come from that green coloring matter of nearly all plants which,\r\nwhile mostly confined to leaves, is not always so. And wherever\r\nchlorophyll is found this process goes on even in the simplest plants.\r\nBecause it is so overwhelmingly a characteristic of leaves and, as we\r\nhave seen, leaves are the one organ of the plant upon which man pins his\r\nonly hope of future food supply, the leaves of all plants may be truly\r\nlikened to a factory the work of which is never ending, the product of\r\nwhich the leaf will never use, but the result of which has far-reaching\r\nconsequences to us all.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS ON INDIVIDUAL PLANTS AND VEGETATION AS A\r\nWHOLE\r\n\r\nNow that we understand the importance of light to all except a very few\r\nplants, and its very close relationship to the green coloring matter of\r\nall leaves, many things about the arrangement and position of leaves,\r\nand indeed of the whole plant, may be understood, which, without this\r\nknowledge, seems the result of mere caprice or chance. It would seem as\r\nthough the habit of plants growing toward the light, and against the\r\npull of gravity, a character almost universal, no matter from what\r\nmountain declivity or rocky cliff it may spring, might be the result of\r\nthe “pull” exerted by light on the green coloring matter in the leaves.\r\nWhile light does aid in plants having a generally erect habit it is not\r\nthe cause of it, as we have many times proved by experiments. As a seed\r\nsprouts and the roots go down into the earth, the shoot, before it has\r\nbroken through the surface and while _still in the dark_, always grows\r\nupward. This property of growing in two opposite directions at the same\r\ntime, the roots always with gravity and the shoot nearly always against\r\nit, is known as _geotropism_. In the case of vines or other trailing\r\nplants there is the same tendency exhibited, even though the plant is\r\nnot erect. We must think of geotropism as a growth habit of all plants,\r\nnot caused by light, for it has been shown to act in the dark, but of\r\nthe greatest advantage to all plants in their initial start toward the\r\nlight. If this were not the case, it may be imagined into what chaos the\r\nvegetable world would be thrown. We are so accustomed to roots going\r\ndown and shoots going up that we are not apt to think of it as the\r\nresult of two antagonistic growth habits, the true cause of which is not\r\nunderstood, the result of which is common knowledge. Geotropism is one\r\nof those mysteries with which the book of nature is crowded, and merely\r\nto describe it and realize its force is by no means to arrive at its\r\ntrue inwardness.\r\n\r\nBut, quite independently of this peculiar growth habit, the stems and\r\noften whole plants do show response to light and many times the\r\nresponse, in its effects, cannot be distinguished from geotropism.\r\nPerhaps the most homely illustration of this is the common house\r\ngeranium which, no matter how often it is turned, always grows toward\r\nthe window, and if not turned at all becomes hopelessly lopsided, with\r\nthe leaves all bending sharply toward the light. Trees growing on a\r\ncliffside, while always growing upward, nearly always may be seen\r\nbending away from the cliff where light is scarce and toward the\r\nunobstructed light. The position of hundreds of twigs and branches on\r\nany tree have been dictated by their exposure to light, and the habit of\r\npractically all trees in the forest of being clear of branches for many\r\nfeet from the ground is another illustration of the profound effect of\r\nlight. In the latter case the taller the trees the farther from the\r\nground are the first branches, and in the big trees of California the\r\nfirst branches are frequently over a hundred feet from the ground. In\r\ntheir young stages all these trees were furnished with branches, the\r\nleaves of which in their day performed their appointed tasks. But in the\r\nstrife and hurry of the crowns of the forest to overreach their\r\nneighbors these lower branches, from the bottom upward, gradually die\r\noff. So inexorable is the plant’s demand for light, that these lower\r\nbranches, in spite of being nearest the source of their food from the\r\nroots, are doomed to be killed. Nature plays no favorites and these\r\nlower branches, once the pride and support of the young tree, are\r\nruthlessly dropped off when they can no longer play the game. This\r\nwholesale slaughter of lower branches in a forest, more complete than\r\nany pruning by man could ever be, gives us, if the story of the factory\r\nleaf has not already done so, some conception of the part played by\r\nlight in the plant world.\r\n\r\nThe shade of certain trees is so much denser than others that they have\r\nbeen planted for this purpose, notably the horse-chestnut and Norway\r\nmaple. Foresters have long recognized this difference in trees and it\r\nwould be strange if nature had not taken advantage of it also. If\r\ncertain trees can still maintain themselves in the forest without\r\nproducing a dense crowd of leaves, such as the silver maple for\r\ninstance, they would have a decided advantage over a tree like the sugar\r\nmaple which casts a much denser shade. A walk through any forest will\r\nshow scores of examples of trees that live and produce seeds by virtue\r\nof the fact, not that they demand all available light, as their more\r\nvigorous neighbors do, but that by a compromise, by an almost diabolical\r\ncunning, their light demands, and of course their leaf exposure, have\r\nbeen cut down to a point where the tree can grow in a place impossible\r\nfor trees that lack this ability. It is, of course, not a trick which\r\nany individual tree can perform at will. Rather is it a characteristic\r\nfound in all individuals of certain kinds, where the comparative\r\ndisadvantage of making less food and having less leaf exposure is more\r\nthan overcome by the enormous advantage of being able to fight their way\r\ninto a forest that would otherwise be impossible for them. We shall see,\r\nin the chapter on Plant Distribution, how this peculiar response to\r\nlight has had effects of considerable significance upon forests,\r\nparticularly after forest fires, lumbering, or other disturbance of the\r\nnatural conditions. Trees in the forest, and the shrubs and herbs under\r\nthem are not the quiet stately things about which the poets are so fond\r\nof singing. They are places, on the contrary, of intense warfare, and\r\nperhaps some of the greatest casualties occur in the battle for light.\r\n\r\nLeaves, as being the most directly involved in the matter of utmost\r\nexposure to light, show the greatest amount of response to it, by their\r\nshape sometimes, by their position nearly always, and very often by the\r\ncharacter of their leafstalks. In many herbs the first young leaves are\r\nrelatively short-stalked, while as the plant grows upward the lower\r\nleaves are progressively longer stalked, which is a direct response to\r\nthe fact that the upper leaves take their full share of light, leaving\r\nlittle or nothing for the lower ones. To avoid complete shading their\r\nleafstalks are often many times the length of their more fortunately\r\nplaced neighbors above them. In those plants like the garden primrose or\r\ncommon weedy plantain, which bear all their leaves in a close cluster or\r\nrosette at the level of the ground, we see an almost fiendish cleverness\r\nin their earlier and later habits of growth. When the leaves first\r\nstart, as they nearly always do among grasslike vegetation in which\r\nthese plants usually have to fight for a chance of life, the leaves grow\r\nstraight up, so that they may get above the level of the surrounding\r\ngrass. Once there, and the precious light an assured fact, they\r\ngradually flatten out their leaves to form a rosette, of course cutting\r\noff the light from the grass about them and killing it just as certainly\r\nas though it were pulled up by the roots. Hundreds of different kinds of\r\nplants do this, apparently with the utmost cruelty to their inoffensive\r\nneighbors, with whom they start upon nearly equal terms in the race for\r\nlife. If they began at once to spread out their rosette while it was\r\nstill in its small spring state, the upward pointing grasses would\r\nsmother it, and as if in anticipation of this the leaves grow up with\r\nthe grass, only to flatten out when the proper time comes for them to\r\nshow their true colors.\r\n\r\nLight not only affects leaves in their habits of growth but it actually\r\ncauses movements in some leaves which are as regular as clockwork. The\r\nbest known cases are those in the pea family and wood sorrels, all of\r\nwhich bear compound leaves. During the day these leaflets are spread out\r\nin the ordinary way and catch the light, but at sundown, as though this\r\nwere a quite useless exertion for the night, they fold up and the leaf\r\n“goes to sleep.” On cloudy days they partly fold up, as if in\r\nrecognition of the fact that for their business of getting light it is\r\nan off day; but also if the sun comes out they hurriedly expand their\r\nleaflets. It is not yet certain whether these apparently intelligent\r\nmovements of leaves in relation to light are of any real advantage to\r\nthe plant as a whole or not. They are surely one of the most interesting\r\nthings to watch and may be seen in locust trees and wood sorrel any\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nJust as we can have too much of a good thing, it is possible for plants\r\nto have too much direct sunlight. In open spaces, where the struggle for\r\nlife centers not about the fight for light but over other matters, we\r\nfind leaves actually protecting themselves against too much exposure,\r\nand by a variety of ingenious ways. The texture of the upper or lower\r\nside, the kind of hair growing on their surface, and the number and size\r\nof their pores, are the most usual ways of leaves arming themselves\r\nagainst an oversupply of the one thing that their neighbors in the cool\r\nforest fight to the death to obtain. There seems to be a fatality\r\nagainst which plants, like ourselves, are nearly helpless. Their\r\nattempts to overcome it, again like our own struggles against an\r\napparently overmastering fate, develop those characteristics that insure\r\nsurvival to the fittest, death to the puny or unaccommodating.\r\n\r\nWe could hardly leave the subject of light and plants’ relation to it\r\nwithout mentioning, perhaps, the most remarkable case of adaptation to\r\npeculiar light conditions. All those aquatic plants that grow beneath\r\nthe surface of the water need and get much less light than ordinary land\r\nplants. But from the island of Madagascar comes the lace leaf or water\r\nyam, which grows in quiet pools that are mostly in the depths of the\r\ntropical forest. Add to the dense shade cast upon the gloomy surface of\r\nsuch ponds the amount of light naturally lost in its passage through the\r\nwater, and we get some notion of the singularly secluded home of this\r\naquatic plant. What, now, is nature’s response to these peculiar\r\nconditions? How do the leaves of this well-shaded inhabitant of quiet\r\npools behave? Their leaves are about a foot long and three or four\r\ninches wide, quite unnecessarily large for a submersed aquatic, but they\r\nconsist _wholly of veins_. There is no “meat” to the leaf, none of that\r\nsoft, green tissue so familiar in ordinary leaves. The conditions under\r\nwhich it is doomed to live almost seem as if it recognized the futility\r\nof having a broad expanse of the usually constituted leaf blade to\r\nexpose to a light which is not there. It is significant that this\r\nskeletonized condition is permanent, the leaf functions much as ordinary\r\naquatic leaves do, but its network of quite naked veins almost seems a\r\nmute protest against its fate. The delicate, lacelike “foliage” of this\r\naquatic adds a touch of beauty to one of the most curious plants in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HOW PLANTS GET THEIR FOOD AND WATER FROM THE EARTH\r\n\r\nIf we could stretch an apparently impervious membrane, like the inner\r\nwhite skin just inside an eggshell, or a piece of parchment, and so form\r\na wall through the middle of a glass box, and then pour into one of the\r\ncompartments pure water and in the other a mixture of water and\r\nmolasses, a very curious result would follow within a comparatively\r\nshort period. We should find that presently there would be a gentle\r\nfiltering of the water through the membrane toward the molasses water,\r\nand similar gentle current in the other direction. In other words,\r\nfluids of different density, if separated by a membrane, tend to\r\nequalize each other. This equalization may not be very rapid, and at\r\nfirst it will be more speedy from the less dense to the more dense, but\r\neventually it will make the different fluids of a common density. This\r\npurely mechanical property of the equalization of fluids separated by a\r\nmembrane is known as _osmosis_, and it is upon the possession of the\r\nequipment necessary for this that roots depend for getting food and\r\nwater from the soil.\r\n\r\nIn our discussion of roots in Chapter I, we found that they end in very\r\nfine subdivisions, which are themselves split up into practically\r\ninvisible root hairs. These root hairs are the only way that roots can\r\nabsorb the food and water in the soil, and they are able to do this\r\nbecause they are provided with a membrane which permits osmosis to act\r\nbetween the solution inside the root hair and the water in the soil. The\r\nsolution in the root hair is mostly a sugary liquid, some of that\r\nsurplus sugar made in the leaves, and it is denser than the soil water,\r\nso there is apparently nothing to prevent an equalization of the liquids\r\non different sides of the membrane. If this actually happened, as it\r\nwould in the case of the simple experiment noted above, then roots would\r\nexchange a fairly rich sugary liquid for a much more watery one, and we\r\nshould find that plants did not get their food from the soil, but really\r\nhave it drained away from them by osmosis. But nature has a cunning\r\ndevice for stopping such robbery, which is prevented by the membranes of\r\nroot hairs being only permeable to the extent of letting water _in_, not\r\npermeable enough to allow sugar to escape. As we have seen, osmosis is\r\na purely mechanical process which, if left to operate without\r\ninterference, would not aid but injure the plant. Surely, nothing with\r\nwhich plants are provided is so important to them as this delicate\r\nmembrane of the root hairs which, while allowing osmosis to act in a\r\none-sided fashion, preserves to the plant the sugary liquid that alone\r\nmakes the absorption of soil water possible.\r\n\r\nAs root hairs are very much alive and work constantly, they must be\r\nprovided with air, without which no living thing can exist. And here,\r\nagain, it seems as though nature, with almost uncanny foresight, had\r\ndeliberately planned for this requirement of roots. And, in this case,\r\nnot by interfering with a physical process by an adjustment of plant\r\nstructure, but by the arrangement of soil particles and the way in which\r\nwater is found in all soils. Soil particles, even in the most compact\r\nclay, do not fill _all_ the space occupied by the soil as a whole. There\r\nare tiny air spaces all through the soil, which insures a constant\r\nsupply of fresh air. That is one reason why gardens are cultivated, to\r\nsee to it that plenty of fresh air is allowed to permeate the soil.\r\nAround the finest soil particles there is always an almost incredibly\r\nthin film of water, which is renewed as soon as it is lost by its\r\nabsorption by the root hairs or by evaporation. This renewal of the\r\nwater film is itself a mechanical process, called capillarity, best\r\nillustrated by putting a few drops of water on a plate and placing on\r\nthem a lump of sugar. The water will spread all through the lump of\r\nsugar in a few seconds and the capillarity that forces it up through the\r\nlump is the same as sees to it that the tiny film of water surrounding\r\nthe finest soil particles is constantly renewed from the lower levels\r\nof the soil.\r\n\r\nLittle do we dream, as we walk over the commonest weed, that buried at\r\nits roots are these delicate arrangements for securing food and water.\r\nOsmosis allowed to act so that the “exchange” of liquids is all to the\r\nadvantage of the plant, capillarity providing a constant water supply,\r\nand the very piling together of the soil so contrived that the\r\nlife-giving air filters all through it--does it not seem as if all this\r\nwere, if not a deliberate plan, certainly a more perfect one than mere\r\nman could have devised?\r\n\r\nIf you will turn back for a moment to the beginning of the description\r\nof how plants get their food, you will find that in osmosis the weaker\r\nliquid tends to permeate the denser one more rapidly than the denser one\r\ndoes the weaker. As we have just seen, the sugary liquid in the root\r\nhairs is denser than the soil water outside, and, furthermore, _none of\r\nit is allowed to escape_. This comparatively greedy process of taking\r\neverything and giving nothing results in a constant flow of soil water\r\ninto the root hairs. When the flow of liquids in osmosis is not at once\r\nequalized, a gentle pressure is brought to bear to make them so. This is\r\nwhat is called _osmotic pressure_, and it is this pressure that forces\r\nthe absorbed liquid through the roots and part way up the trunk of even\r\nthe tallest trees. While we have just said it is a gentle pressure, that\r\nis true only in the case where the osmosis has free play, and the\r\npressure is stopped with the perfect mixing of the two liquids. But what\r\nif they can never mix? What may not the accumulated osmotic pressure\r\namount to in such a one-sided process as goes on in root hairs with\r\neverything coming in and nothing going out. Cut-off stems, with a\r\npressure gauge attached to them, indicate that in some plants the\r\npressure is from 60 up to 170 pounds!\r\n\r\nAnother result of this pressure is that it keeps leaves and the fleshy\r\nstems of plants in their ordinary position. The actual solid part of\r\nnearly all leaves is scarcely 5 per cent of their bulk and all the rest\r\nis water. The constant pressure of this water from the roots is\r\nsufficient to keep leaves comparatively stiff and rigid, how stiff is\r\nquickly realized if the pressure stops and the leaf wilts or withers.\r\nSometimes this osmotic pressure, particularly during rainy weather,\r\nbecomes so great as to cause injury to the plant, the splitting of\r\ntomatoes and occasionally of plums, being due to it. This osmotic\r\npressure, together with the extra pull given by the leaves, is\r\nsufficient to account for the rise of water to the tops of the tallest\r\ntrees. The tallest trees in the world are certain kinds of blue gum in\r\nAustralia which frequently reach a height exceeding 300 feet. What the\r\ncombined osmotic pressure and leaf pull must be to carry such a heavy\r\nthing as water to such a great height is easier to imagine than to\r\ncalculate.\r\n\r\nThe root hairs, then, by the process already described, absorb the water\r\nfrom the soil, but plants can no more live on water alone than we can.\r\nAs we have seen, the membrane in the root hairs cannot allow the passage\r\nof even the tiniest particle of solid matter. In fact the root hair\r\nitself is so small that it can only be seen through the microscope, and\r\nof course the membrane is smaller still. Plant foods, then, can never be\r\nsolids, but must always be such materials as can be dissolved in water.\r\nThe chief of these are chemical substances, such as lime, potash,\r\nnitrogen, magnesium, phosphorus, sulphur, and iron. Hydrogen is also\r\nnecessary, but as this makes up half the composition of water, there is\r\na permanent supply of that provided by the soil water. These things make\r\nup the great part of plant foods taken in through the roots, and it is\r\nfrom these that leaves, by a process you already understand in its\r\nessential details, manufacture sugar and starch.\r\n\r\nBut neither starch nor sugar, important as they are to the plant, and\r\nabsolutely necessary as they are to us, are the only things made by\r\nplants. Leaves may well be called factories, but plants are themselves\r\nthe most wonderful chemical laboratories, beside which any built by man\r\nare as play-things. For plants, by processes too complicated to be\r\nexplained here, work over their accumulation of starch and sugar,\r\nrecombine some of their constituents, and store up in various parts of\r\nthe plant the results, which are often such food ingredients as protein.\r\nThis is the really essential food substance in wheat, as it is in eggs\r\nand meat. No chemist has ever succeeded in making a single scrap of it,\r\nyet it is such an everyday occurrence in practically all plants that it,\r\nwith starch and sugar, forms the great food supply of the world. Not\r\nprotein alone, but all the amazing plant products like the oils from the\r\nolive and the resin from pine, rubber, the drugs of plant origin, even\r\ntobacco--all these and hundreds of others are made by plants from those\r\nfew simple foods absorbed through the roots, literally pumped up to the\r\nleaves and there, under the magic of sunlight, combined and recombined,\r\nworked over and changed utterly in their make-up. Nothing could be more\r\nperfect than the marshaling of forces and contrivances to secure the\r\nresult; let there be even the least bungling, and for us the world\r\nwould cease to be worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nNor does the work of plants stop here. If it did, they would be not\r\nunlike a commission merchant who had gathered from the four corners of\r\nthe earth a supply of eggs only to find he could not or more likely\r\nwould not sell them all at once, and yet had failed to provide himself\r\nwith proper storage. Plants, too, have times in their life when adequate\r\nstorage is necessary for them. So true is this that unless there is food\r\nenough stored in seeds to give a start to seedlings before their own\r\nroots begin to work, they would die almost at once. In seeds and in many\r\nnearly dormant parts of plants these foods are stored away for future\r\nuse. The tubers of potatoes and all our root crops, like beet and\r\nparsnip, are common examples of this. Even the manufacture of wood in\r\nthe trunks of trees is a storage appliance on the part of the plant, for\r\nwood is just as much one of the food products of a plant as wheat or\r\nrice.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. BORROWING FROM THE LIVING AND ROBBING FROM THE DEAD\r\n\r\nWith such a beautifully perfected mechanism for getting food it might\r\nseem as though all plants would be satisfied to lead that life of\r\nindependence for which they are so splendidly equipped. Some of them,\r\nhowever, are like men in one respect: there seems to be no end to the\r\nchase after getting something for nothing. Those that stand on their own\r\nroots, get their food honestly, and take nothing for which they do not\r\nmake prodigal returns, make up the great bulk of the vegetation of the\r\nearth. Their independence has dubbed them with the title\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN PIPE. (_Monotropa uniflora_). A saprophytic plant\r\ninhabiting rich woods in eastern North America.

Courtesy\r\nof Brooklyn Botanic Garden._)]\r\n\r\nautophytes_, literally solitary or self-providing plants, and this\r\nthrifty mode of life is called _autophytic_. But a few kinds of plants,\r\nactually many millions of individuals, have more devious ways of getting\r\ntheir food and provide strong contrast to their sturdier associates.\r\n\r\nThese baser modes of life appear to have been rather insidiously\r\ndeveloped, as though there had been some hesitation at even the smallest\r\ndeparture from the normal. Of course we must not forget that plants,\r\nwhile living things, are never reasoning ones, and that good and evil\r\nand all other qualities that are ascribed to plants are perfectly\r\nforeign to them. Throughout this book, and in many others, the habits of\r\nplants are spoken of as base, for instance, or good. What is actually\r\nthe fact is that nature works in truly marvelous ways, and to our\r\nreasoning faculties these adjustments seem clothed with attributes they\r\ndo not really possess. But the description of them in the terms of our\r\neveryday speech, the translation of their behavior into the current\r\nconceptions of mankind, does so fix them in our minds that they cease to\r\nbe “just plants,” and we no longer put their habits in the category of\r\nthose interesting things that nearly everyone forgets.\r\n\r\nOne of the first signs of departure from the usual methods of getting\r\nfood is the association of certain minute organisms at the roots upon\r\nwhich plants, otherwise autophytic, depend for aid in securing\r\nnourishment. This characteristic is fairly common, notably in all the\r\nplants of the pea family, such as peas, beans, locust trees, vetch,\r\nclover, and hundreds of others. If the roots of any of these be\r\nexamined, it will be seen that attached to the smaller divisions of\r\nthem are small tubercles from the size of a pinhead to a pea, depending\r\non the kind. These tubercles or galls are caused by and infested with\r\nbacteria, the smallest of all plants. The bacteria have the\r\nextraordinary power of changing nitrogen into nitrates, which is the\r\nonly form in which nitrogen can be absorbed by roots. Not only do they\r\naccomplish this, but excess nitrogen is stored in the roots by the same\r\nagency. It is this fact that has resulted in the planting of vetch and\r\nkindred plants for soil enrichment, as each year there is a residue of\r\nnitrogen left in their roots and by so much they add plant food to the\r\nsoil. For hundreds of years farmers have done this, but only quite\r\nrecently have we known why they did so. The occurrence of bacteria or\r\nmicrobes at the roots of plants is much more common than was formerly\r\nsupposed to be the case, and many other plants than those of the pea\r\nfamily depend, at least in part, upon them in getting food from the\r\nsoil. While not wholly autophytic, such plants do make some return for\r\nwhat they gain, as some of them at least pay dividends in extra\r\nnitrogen, and all of them provide opportunity for the bacteria to live.\r\nThe latter play an important part in populating the soil, which is not\r\nthe comparatively sterile thing it appears to be. Actually it is\r\ninfested with organisms that play a mighty, if rather inconspicuous,\r\npart in the work of preparing the soil for plant growth. These organisms\r\nare so minute and the chemical nature of their work is so complicated\r\nthat merely to mention their existence must suffice here. This close\r\nassociation of certain roots and bacteria, which, as we have seen, is of\r\nmutual advantage, is known as _symbiosis_. It is really only a kind of\r\nexchange, not unlike the storybook community that helped out by taking\r\nin each other’s washing. Unlike that community the association between\r\nthe two works to the actual advantage of both, but the process is\r\nundeniably a step away from those wholly autophytic plants which live\r\nfree and independent of such aid.\r\n\r\nA much more gruesome habit of certain plants is their reliance for food\r\nonly upon the dead. In the Indian pipe, some kinds of shinleaf, and in\r\nmany other plants their roots and root hairs are changed or often nearly\r\nlacking, and we find them growing only on the dead bodies of other\r\nplants. One peculiarly repulsive characteristic of such plants is that\r\nthey secrete at their roots a substance that hastens the decay of the\r\ndead, and, as if this were not rapid enough, there are associated with\r\nthem certain kinds of minute fungus organisms that also speed up\r\ndecomposition. Plants with this charming mode of life are known as\r\n_saprophytes_, literally _sapros_, rotten, and _phytes_, plants. “Rotten\r\nplants” they may be in their mode of life, but the pearly white stems\r\nand flowers of the Indian pipe have a certain ghostly charm, an almost\r\nstatuesque beauty among the normal greenery of the gloomy dark woods in\r\nwhich they always grow. It is not without significance that Indian pipe\r\nbears no leaves, has none or almost none of the life-giving green\r\ncoloring matter which we have seen to be the almost priceless possession\r\nof plants which lead a different, and perhaps a better life. The great\r\nbulk of saprophytes bear no leaves, and some only partially wedded to\r\nthe habit appear to be midway between bearing normal green leaves and\r\nbearing none, or much reduced ones that are quite unlike the busy\r\nfactories we know normal green leaves to be. Plants with this method of\r\ngetting their food, must of course grow in places where dead and\r\ndecaying vegetation is plentiful, and often as such soil is turned up\r\nthere may be noted a peculiar dank odor, suggestive not only of its\r\norigin, but of the fact that these “rotten plants” make their home in\r\nit. Some of our most beautiful orchids grow in this fashion, but even\r\nthere, in spite of flowers that for beauty of form are without rivals,\r\nthe plants have no green coloring matter in their leaves, which are\r\noften reduced or even wanting altogether.\r\n\r\nIt might almost seem as if demoralization, so far as food habits are\r\nconcerned, had reached its lowest point in these plants that literally\r\nrob the dead, but there are still lower depths to which certain plants\r\nhave been reduced. This consists of robbing the living, and such plants\r\nare called _parasites_, a word perfectly familiar in other connections.\r\nParasitic plants have no roots, but attach themselves to the roots of\r\nother plants, somewhat generously called _hosts_, from which they derive\r\ntheir food. The best known case is the common Christmas mistletoe, and\r\nthe dodder (Figure 68), but there are hundreds of others. Nothing in all\r\nthe realm of plant life so perfectly fits the action to the word as\r\nplants of this type, flourishing when the host flourishes, dying when it\r\ndies. Producing flowers and seeds, and often, by an irony of fate,\r\nperfectly green leaves, they are nevertheless the most debased of all\r\nplants in their mode of life.\r\n\r\nThese successive steps in the degradation of food habits, are not always\r\nthe clean-cut things they might be inferred to be from the foregoing.\r\nThere are many intermediate stages; it may even prove to be the case\r\nthat some plants are wholly autophytic at certain stages of their life,\r\nand slip partially into more devious practices at other stages. The\r\nwhole affair is not yet thoroughly understood and may well be the result\r\nof competition, as it is quite conceivable that if the getting of food\r\nin normal ways became difficult or impossible plants may have had to\r\nresort to other methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--THE DODDER\r\n\r\nA leafless parasitic vine which steals its food from the plants to which\r\nit is attached.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. WHAT PLANTS DO WITH WATER AND HOW THEY BREATHE\r\n\r\nSome one has said that one day without water would make men liars, in\r\ntwo days they become thieves, and after the third or fourth day they\r\nwould kill to get water. In the Army Records at Washington is a report\r\nof one of our expeditions, which in chasing Indians got lost in a\r\ndesert, and in which the soldiers fought among themselves for even the\r\nmost repulsive liquids. It hardly needs these gruesome examples,\r\nhowever, to confirm what everyone who has ever been mildly thirsty\r\nknows, that water is an essential for all animals, and that to be\r\nwithout it is to suffer torture. Air of the proper kind is just as\r\nimportant, and because its absence or impurity causes more sudden agony\r\nand a quicker death, the need of it is that much more acute. Plants rely\r\neven more upon these two essentials of life, and in getting them they\r\nbehave in ways just as ruthless as do men who are suddenly deprived of\r\neither of them.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen in “How Plants Get Their Food and Water from the\r\nSoil,” the water is the carrier of the food elements from the soil, but\r\nwater as such does much more for the plant than act as a carrier.\r\nOsmotic pressure, a never-ending pump, keeps sending up a steady stream\r\nof water to the limits of its power. In everything except trees it seems\r\nfairly certain that this pressure is sufficient to drive water into the\r\nremotest leaves. It finally reaches these tiny rooms in the leaf about\r\nwhich we read in the account of Leaves as Factories. And just here a\r\nvery curious thing happens. Each room is, as we have seen, a very busy\r\nplace, crowded with all the necessary equipment to make sugar, and yet\r\nthere is still room for water which is just as necessary as the other\r\nfittings; in fact so necessary is it that the whole interior of the room\r\nis bathed in water. This irrigation system works so well that the walls\r\nof the room literally bulge with the pressure of the water in them. If\r\nthey did not--a condition known as turgor--the plant would at once wilt,\r\nand if no new supply came it would wither and die.\r\n\r\nBut water cannot stay in this condition of pressure and stagnation for\r\neven a brief period. That would be as if a leaf were like a toy balloon\r\nwhich, after inflation, had the entrance pinched and so remained\r\ninflated. And while we have all along spoken of factories for making\r\nsugar, and pressure pumps for forcing up food and water, it must never\r\nbe forgotten that this marvelously adjusted mechanism is a living thing.\r\nConstantly growing, even producing their own means of falling in the\r\nautumn, leaves must be thought of as living machines, just as we are\r\nstill more highly developed machines. In other words the accumulated\r\nwater in the cells of the leaf must be removed, after it has served its\r\nuse, and replaced by fresh supplies. The removal is carried on by its\r\nevaporation into the halls, or, in the more precise terms of our account\r\nof leaves as factories, into the _intercellular spaces_. It will be\r\nrecalled that these are connected with the outside air through the pores\r\nor stoma. When the air outside is hot and dry it might easily suck out\r\nby evaporation all the water vapor in these intercellular spaces and\r\nwilting follow at once. This would actually happen if the guard cells,\r\nalready mentioned, were not constantly on the job. They control the size\r\nof the opening just as certainly as a steam valve does, and maintain,\r\nwith a few exceptions, just the proper amount of water loss not only to\r\nmaintain turgor, but to see to it that transpiration, as this process is\r\ncalled, goes on rapidly enough to insure fresh supplies of water being\r\nsent to the leaf. The opening and closing of the stoma by the guard\r\ncells is a nicely balanced operation dependent upon root pressure,\r\nturgor, and atmospheric conditions. Guard cells have, because of this,\r\nbeen much studied in spite of the fact of their microscopic size. We now\r\nknow that they allow greater openings during the night and reduce them\r\nduring the day. When we reflect that the constant removal of water in\r\nthe leaf, both as such, and as the only carrier of food supplies from\r\nthe roots, depends in such large measure upon the functioning of these\r\nguard cells, then we come to some realization of their importance to the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThey do not always work unaided, for in many places the transpiration,\r\neven with their best efforts, would exceed the rise of water in the\r\nplant and death must follow if such a condition exists for long. This\r\nmay be the case in certain bog plants, where, even with their roots in\r\nthe water, they actually are in danger of drying out because the\r\ncomposition of bog water makes it partially unfit for most plants. And,\r\nagain, in very open dry or windy places, such as deserts or the mountain\r\ntops above timber line, the actual supply of water may be insufficient.\r\nMany plants growing in such places have their leaves, particularly the\r\nunder surfaces of them, clothed with various kinds of hairs. These may\r\nbe quite velvety or cottony, but in any event, either by their texture\r\nor their color, they tend to reduce transpiration. An extreme case is a\r\ndesert plant from Arizona where the whole leaf surface is covered with\r\nan ashy gray velvety coating, which, of course, absorbs less heat than a\r\nnormal green leaf, and in addition there are much fewer pores through\r\nwhich transpiration could be carried on. In ever so many leaves nature\r\nhas provided them with a thick coating of hairs in early spring, which\r\nthey lose later in the summer. Shrubs and herbs, especially those that\r\nstart earlier than the trees under which they grow, very often may be\r\nfound with a dense woolly or silky covering in early spring. As the\r\nshade becomes denser and the need of the protection less, the wool or\r\nsilk is shed, sometimes completely. Some of the most conspicuous cases\r\nof this are certain kinds of our common shadbush, which in April are\r\ncovered with a beautiful grayish-white silky coat, but by August are\r\npractically the ordinary green color of other leaves. The hairy covering\r\nof leaves is well worth observation, as it may hide not a few facts\r\nabout transpiration and, in some leaves, has had much to do with their\r\npreservation from grazing animals. Some, like the common mullein, are\r\nnever touched, and may be found standing like sentinels in fields\r\notherwise cropped short.\r\n\r\nIn many leaves there is conflict between those forces that result in the\r\nleaf getting the utmost possible exposure to light and those that\r\nprevent too rapid transpiration. On the one hand there is the absolute\r\nnecessity for light, on the other the ever-present danger that the\r\nresponse of leaves to this necessity will result in a transpiration rate\r\ntoo rapid to be held in check by the guard cells. The compromise between\r\nthese two forces, each pulling in opposite directions, gives to some\r\nleaves a series of movements that are among the most interesting things\r\nin nature. One of the most marked examples is the common wild lettuce, a\r\nweedy plant of our roadsides introduced from Europe. In bright sunlight\r\nthe leaves are turned so that the edge of the blade faces upward, and\r\nthe surface is thus protected from the direct rays of the sun, but\r\nduring cloudy weather or in the shade the leaves turn into the ordinary\r\nposition of most foliage leaves. It is difficult to avoid the inference\r\nthat photosynthesis, which, as we have seen is an absolute necessity to\r\nthe leaf, is in the wild lettuce retarded by transpiration, to avoid the\r\ntoo rapid rate of which the leaf is turned on edge. In this plant the\r\nleaf base, as though to be ready for whatever change transpiration or\r\nphotosynthesis may demand, is so attached to the stem that such changes\r\nare made with the least possible delay or wrenching. In one of the many\r\nkinds of blue gum trees of Australia all the leaves turn one way in the\r\nlight, and another in shade or on cloudy days. Ever so many plants have\r\npartial movements of their leaves, a good many of which are in response\r\nto these opposing demands, one pulling the leaf into the greatest\r\npossible light, the other holding it away from that condition. There are\r\nother movements of leaves, of parts of the flower, or even of the whole\r\nplant that are not so certainly the result of the conflict between light\r\nrequirements and the necessity of conserving water supply. They will be\r\nconsidered presently.\r\n\r\nWhile most plants are well provided with methods of losing water, so\r\nwell provided in fact that in very hot or very long dry periods it is a\r\ncommon sight to see many plants literally panting for more water, there\r\nare some apparently more cautious individuals, who reverse this process.\r\nAll throughout tropical America hundreds of relatives of the pineapple\r\nhave their leaves so formed and arranged that they catch and hold\r\nconsiderable quantities of water. In one kind, called _Hohenbergia_, the\r\nlong leaves are joined together toward their base into a water-tight\r\nfunnel, which will hold a quart or two of water over a period of\r\ndrought. In Africa the extraordinary traveler’s-tree, a giant herb\r\ngrowing twenty to thirty feet tall, has the overlapping leaf bases so\r\narranged that they hold many gallons of water. And we have already seen\r\nhow the giant cactus of our own Southwest will hold 125 gallons. The\r\nmost remarkable case is the Ibervillea from the deserts of Arizona. In\r\nriding over this country one may find objects that look not unlike a\r\nburned pudding, about two feet in diameter and nearly as high. From the\r\ncenter comes a delicate stalk with the finest feathery foliage and tiny\r\nflowers. Of roots there appear to be almost none, and these curious\r\nobjects, which are very hard and woody, might almost be taken for\r\nstones. But they are actually plants not distantly related to squash and\r\npumpkin, and one of them collected years ago and brought into a museum\r\nbehaved in quite the most thrifty fashion of any plant yet discovered.\r\nIt was carefully cleaned and put in a museum case and locked up as a\r\ncuriosity for the wondering public to gaze at. But suddenly, almost\r\nmiraculously, it sent out its delicate growth which grew its appointed\r\ntime and then withered. Imagine the astonishment of the curators of this\r\nmuseum to find it doing the same thing the next year, and the next.\r\nFinally after putting forth its shoot for five years it actually died\r\nand is now a peaceful museum specimen. No other such case of water\r\nstorage is known, but thousands of plants have this remarkable ability\r\nto a less degree, all in response to conditions that would mean\r\ndestruction to plants not so providently equipped.\r\n\r\nThis conservation of water on such a great scale offers striking\r\ncontrast to the truly prodigal habits of certain plants that actually\r\ndrip water, so charged are they with this precious liquid, and so little\r\nstress do their conditions of life put them under in this respect. Where\r\nwater is plentiful and turgor maintained almost to the bursting point,\r\nevaporation in a moist or chilly atmosphere does not suck out water\r\nvapor fast enough. Sometimes, around the edges of the leaves of the\r\ncommon garden nasturtium, drops of water may be found, literally forced\r\nout as drops, rather than transpired as water vapor. This happens to a\r\nconsiderable number of plants, during the night when transpiration is\r\nlaggard, and such drops are usually mistaken for dew. The latter is\r\nactually the condensation of moisture in the air upon the leaves of\r\nplants which cool down more rapidly than the air, and seldom due to the\r\nforcing out of drops of water from leaves, although in rare cases it may\r\nbe. In tropical forests, where the humidity is very heavy and water\r\nsupply from the roots copious, certain leaves leak water so fast and are\r\nso constructed that this excess is prevented from accumulating on the\r\nleaf. The pipal tree of India has long drip tips to its leaves that\r\nconduct the excess water from the blade to the end of the slender tip\r\nwhere it drips off. The advantage of these dripping points is obvious,\r\nfor in regions so humid that water is forced out of the leaf, the\r\ncoating of the leaf with this extra moisture would by that much retard\r\ntranspiration. Dripping points, which in less exaggerated forms than in\r\nthe pipal tree are common in many parts of the world, are thus of\r\ndecided advantage.\r\n\r\nWhether it be desirous to retain water or to lose it by gradual\r\nevaporation, or expel an excess of it, each species of plant has\r\ndeveloped the apparatus to best preserve its individual life. While only\r\nthe barest outline of these adjustments to the water requirements of\r\nplants has been given here, the details form an almost dramatic picture\r\nof struggle of the different kinds of plants for survival. The extremes\r\nare the desert plants on the one hand and those of the rain forests in\r\nthe tropics on the other. The chapter on Plant Distribution will show\r\nhow important these water requirements of plants have been in\r\ndetermining what grows on the earth to-day.\r\n\r\nWith carbon dioxide going in, oxygen, water vapor and, as we have seen,\r\neven liquid water coming out of the stoma of leaves, it might be\r\nsurmised that these busy little pores and their guard cells had done\r\nwork enough for the plant. And yet there is still one more act to play\r\nand the stoma have much to do with it. For this process of\r\nphotosynthesis and the closely related one of supplying food and water\r\nto the leaf cannot go on without respiration, which is quite another\r\nthing. In plants respiration or breathing has no more to do with\r\ndigestion than it does in man. Digestion in man is not unlike\r\nphotosynthesis in plants, except that plants make food in the process\r\nwhile men destroy it. But plants must breathe just as we do, and, as we\r\nneed oxygen to renew our vital processes, so do they. While respiration\r\nis a necessary part of plant activity it is not such an important part\r\nas photosynthesis, for which it is often mistaken. The thing to fix in\r\nour minds is that photosynthesis makes food, uses the sun’s energy and\r\nreleases oxygen in the process, while respiration uses oxygen and might\r\nalmost be likened to the oil of a machine--necessary but producing\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. RESTLESS AND IRRITABLE PLANTS\r\n\r\nIn walking through the quiet cathedrallike stillness of a deep forest or\r\nover the fields and moors, perhaps our chief thought is how restful the\r\nscene is, and what a contrast the quiet, patient plants make to the\r\ndarting insects or flitting birds that our walk disturbs. We found at\r\nthe beginning of this book that ability to get about is one of the main\r\ndifferences between animals and plants. Like so many first thoughts,\r\nthis is, however, only a half truth, for while most plants, seemingly by\r\na kind of fatality, are anchored forever to the place of their birth,\r\nmany of them do move certain parts of themselves and that quite\r\nregularly. While some of these movements have already been hinted at as\r\na possible response to transpiration or too intense light, there are\r\nothers where the advantage to the plant, if any, has yet to be\r\ndemonstrated. These other movements, perhaps because their cause has\r\nnever been discovered, seem the more mysterious as they certainly are\r\nmore weird and interesting than almost any other of the curious things\r\nthat plants do.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most difficult thing in the world is to keep an active\r\ngrowing child perfectly still for more than a few moments at a time.\r\nThere seems to be some impelling force that makes young growing things\r\nin a constant state of restlessness, and it is perhaps not so\r\nextraordinary, after all, that practically all young plants are restless\r\nin the sense that they are never quite still. And, like many grown-up\r\npeople who do not know what repose in their waking moments really means,\r\nthere are a goodly number of plants that are restless until the day they\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin, perhaps the greatest man that the last century produced,\r\nwrote a book in two volumes on these restless plants, and proved by a\r\nseries of experiments illustrated by charts which the plants themselves\r\ndrew for him, that there were perhaps no plants that do not move at\r\nleast some part of themselves during the early stages of their career.\r\nWhile he never could explain the cause of these movements he left in\r\nthat book an imperishable record of the amount and direction of these\r\nmysterious movements, which are almost to be likened to the growing\r\npains of young children.\r\n\r\nThe tips or growing shoots of many plants will point in one direction in\r\nthe early morning, a different way at noon and still a different one by\r\nnightfall. Hundreds of totally unrelated plants seem to have this habit\r\nof moving their tips through a definite cycle during each day and this\r\nrestlessness does not appear to be of the slightest use to them. It\r\ncannot be response to the moving of the sun through the sky, for often\r\nthe movement may be away from the direct sunshine, and sometimes the\r\nmotion goes on in the dark, as experiments have proved.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to see the movement of the whole upper part of a plant,\r\nalthough it is well known that they do move in many cases. But in the\r\ntendrils the movement is often easy to observe and even to induce. Some\r\nof these slender aids to climbing plants, if they happen to be swinging\r\nfreely in the air, do actually make slow circular movements, that even\r\nif they were designed for the purpose could not more perfectly\r\naccomplish their obvious intent, which is to catch the nearest favorable\r\nsupport. These circular movements are to the left in the hop,\r\nhoneysuckle and many other plants, to the right in the climbing beans,\r\nmorning-glory and some others. When the tendril reaches a support it\r\nalmost immediately turns about it, in the same direction as its free\r\nmovements through the air have been. It is thus this apparently aimless\r\nswinging of tendrils through space that determines whether the vine is\r\ngoing to twine to the right or left. The speed with which a tendril will\r\ntake its first turns about a support is so comparatively rapid that,\r\nonce the support is caught there is scarcely a chance of the vine being\r\ntorn away by the wind or other agency as would surely happen if tendril\r\nmovements were the leisurely things that some folks think they are. In\r\nthe case of one Passion-flower vine, which are gorgeous climbers mostly\r\nfrom the tropics, the tendril made a complete turn in two minutes after\r\nit first touched a possible support. And there is a quite noticeable\r\nmovement in thirty seconds if the tip of the tendril be ever so lightly\r\ntouched. Teasing tendrils to see how much or how fast they will coil has\r\nresulted in some extraordinary cases of the “comeback” of some of them.\r\nDarwin irritated a tendril for a few moments and induced a partial\r\ncoiling which straightened out when the object causing it was withdrawn.\r\nTo see how long the plant would stand this sort of thing and still not\r\nbe literally tired of coiling he succeeded in making the plant partially\r\ncoil, and by withdrawing the incentive uncoil again, over twenty times\r\nin fifty-four hours. An impulse to coil of such persistence as this\r\nnaturally results in vines forming the impenetrable thickets they do in\r\nmany forests. It emphasizes how restless are the growing points of these\r\nclimbers, and serves as a striking illustration of those gradual\r\nmovements of many other plants that seem to have some relation to\r\ngrowth, but in a way not yet understood. For while it is an obvious\r\nadvantage for the vine to swing its tendrils through the air this\r\nadvantage has not yet been proved the cause of the swinging. In fact if\r\nall possible supports are removed the tendril will often coil anyway, a\r\nperfectly futile proceeding, that looks almost like disgust.\r\n\r\nThis general restlessness, which by the imaginative has been thought of\r\nas a mild protest by plants at their otherwise fixed position, is not so\r\nspectacular as that of certain other plants, notably the poplars. A\r\nflattened instead of a round leafstalk makes the leaves of these trees\r\nflutter in the lightest air and in a gale the tree is a mass of animated\r\nfoliage. No use has ever been found for this curious habit and it is not\r\ncertain that it is of the least advantage to the tree. If anything, the\r\nconstant movement may have the decided disadvantage of increasing\r\ntranspiration.\r\n\r\nIn our common wood sorrel the leaflets on cloudy days or during the\r\nnight regularly “go to sleep.” That is, they are folded at such times,\r\nrather than spread out in the ordinary way. These sleep movements may\r\nhave something to do with transpiration, but whether or not this is true\r\nthey are very regular and in certain plants the habit is remarkably and\r\nrather mysteriously uniform. Why, for instance, do the leaflets of these\r\nwood sorrels, the beans, lupine, locust tree and licorice plant, always\r\nfold downward while the clovers, vetch, peas, and bird’s-foot trefoil\r\nare always folded upward? Such movements and their direction are among\r\nthe unsolved problems of botany, and merely to know of them or observe\r\nthem leads us nowhere as to their true inwardness.\r\n\r\nBut quite apart from these merely restless plants, and there are\r\nthousands of different kinds which are known to move slightly, at least\r\nduring their young stages, are a few more decidedly active ones that are\r\nseemingly irritable. At least they show peculiar movements if touched,\r\nand at night. One of the best known is the sensitive plant from tropical\r\nAmerica. Its twice compound leaf is composed of many tiny leaflets\r\nwhich upon the slightest touch close up and apparently wither on their\r\nstalk at once. In five seconds after the leaf is touched it will appear\r\nlike a wilted wreck. If the jar is sharp enough the whole plant will\r\ndroop, and the response to a sudden jar is almost electrically quick in\r\nits action. And yet all this sudden wilting, actually caused by a quick\r\nloss of turgor, is slowly repaired and the plant carries on quite\r\nnormally again until another shock renews its irritable response. This\r\nplant does the same thing gradually during the night, except that the\r\nleaflets recover their normal position only with the rise of the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom India comes the most remarkable of all plants so far as movements\r\nare concerned. For in the telegraph plant the movements are so regular\r\nand long continued that irritability might almost be said to be\r\ncontinuous. The plant is a low shrub or herb with compound leaves, and\r\nthe terminal leaflet, which is much larger than its neighbors on either\r\nside of their common stalk, performs a motion that describes with its\r\ntip an irregular oval or ellipse. But the movement is not steady; it\r\ngoes by a series of slight but perfectly distinct jerks. It takes about\r\ntwo minutes for the leaf to complete its cycle, and it is this jerky\r\nmovement that has given the plant its name. During the night its\r\nleaflets stop this apparently quite useless performance, the cause of\r\nwhich is quite unknown. It is often grown in greenhouse collections\r\nwhere its strange movements may be seen on any sunny day.\r\n\r\nMany other cases of the restlessness or irritability of plants could be\r\ngiven, and nothing has been said here of the curious movements of some\r\ninsectivorous plants as they have already been mentioned. The very\r\nconsiderable movements of certain flower and fruit organs will also be\r\nconsidered elsewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt cannot have escaped the thoughtful reader that all of this chapter on\r\nplant behavior has dealt with those functions of plants in which roots,\r\nstems, or leaves play the chief part. These purely vegetative actions of\r\nplants, what might almost be called their bread and butter activities,\r\nwould never lead to perpetuating their kind. For while all of these\r\nfunctions are necessary, except certain apparently wayward movements\r\nwhich still remain unexplained, they are in a sense only the preparation\r\nfor an infinitely more important act, the reproduction of their kind.\r\nWhat the poetic have called the love of the flowers, or in more prosaic\r\nbut perhaps more truthful words the fertilization, pregnancy, and birth\r\nof the new race, will be considered in a separate chapter. No other act\r\nof the plant world is so interesting as the mechanism of reproduction,\r\nthe almost endless devices for securing it, and the ingenuity of nature\r\nin seeing to it that there are no flukes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHOW PLANTS PRODUCE THEIR YOUNG\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no device of nature that more perfectly accomplishes\r\nits purpose than the one with which all living things are endowed--the\r\ninstinct for the renewal of life. In man the dawn of the mating instinct\r\nhas ever been the theme of poets, and some of its manifestations are the\r\ndespair of ascetics. Through it some of the noblest of man’s emotions\r\nhave arisen, and because of its perversion our daily newspapers\r\nchronicle the basest and most sordid tragedies.\r\n\r\nBut whether noble or ignoble, this instinct for mating is, in its\r\nsimplest terms, only a provision of nature that all life contains within\r\nitself the means of renewing life. Without this, life, so far as we know\r\nit, would end with the present generation. Perhaps our understanding of\r\nthis decree of an all-wise nature to increase and multiply will be\r\nheightened by looking at it not only from its familiar manifestations in\r\nman, but more broadly. Seen from this broader viewpoint, it is the\r\ninherent legacy of all living things from the dawn of life on the earth\r\ndown to the present. Even the simplest one-celled organisms have the\r\nfaculty of increasing. In all plants, both the flowerless ones and those\r\nproducing flowers, the process is carried to a perfection almost\r\nunbelievable in its intricacy and in provisions against its failure.\r\nFrom the matings of flowers much may be gleaned; even man himself can\r\nlearn from them the capacity for sacrifice, the sinking of individual\r\naims and pleasures in the greater scheme of conforming to that necessity\r\nfor renewal of the race upon which all progress must be based.\r\n\r\nThe equipment which different flowers have developed for this purpose,\r\ntheir almost uncanny devices to make certain that only the distant and\r\nforeign male can ever impregnate the female, the enormous wastage of\r\nboth unfertilized females and males that will never become fathers, and\r\nthe overwhelming effectiveness of it all, in spite of this\r\nprodigality--these manifestations of the production of young in the\r\nplant world will take up the rest of this chapter. All the first part\r\nwill tell of this process in flowering plants, while the second shows\r\nhow flowerless plants accomplish the same end in more secret ways.\r\nFinally, in a brief third part, we shall see how, without mating of the\r\nsexes, nature has still one other way to see to it that there is a\r\nconstant supply of young.\r\n\r\nWe have already made clear that all plants are divided upon the basis of\r\nwhether they bear flowers and their mating goes on before the world, or\r\nwhether they bear none and the process is accomplished in more secret\r\nways. Because flowers are so much better known, and it is simpler to see\r\nhow the act is consummated in them than in the _cryptogamous plants_, we\r\nshall first consider the _phanerogams_ or flowering plants, and in the\r\nsecond section of this chapter the _cryptogams_ or flowerless plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. VISIBLE MARRIAGE OF FLOWERING PLANTS\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter, under the section devoted to flowers, we found\r\nthat the stamens are the male and the pistils the female organs of\r\nreproduction. As the period for mating draws near there is developed in\r\nthe _anther_, which is the enlarged tip of the stamen, a fine, usually\r\nyellow, powder known as _pollen_. This matures in the anther, and when\r\nripe is discharged from tiny pores.\r\n\r\nPollen is made up of individual _pollen grains_, which are very often\r\nstuck together so that we see only the mass, not the individual pollen\r\ngrain. Sometimes the pollen is not sticky, as in the case of pine trees\r\nor in the ragweed--a fertile cause of hay fever. In these, and hundreds\r\nof other plants, the wind will blow great clouds of pollen through the\r\nair. When we stop to consider that a single, or at most a very few\r\npollen grains are all that are necessary--in fact, are all that _can_ be\r\nof real service--the enormous wastage of the male fertilizing substance,\r\nin order that mating be secured, gives us some idea of how prodigal is\r\nnature in this supreme function.\r\n\r\nThe pistil, or female organ of reproduction, is more cautious in the\r\nexpenditure of its resources. As we have seen, it is composed of a\r\nswollen base, the _ovary_, a slender shank, the _style_, and a swollen\r\nor branched tip, the _stigma_. In some plants the ovary is divided into\r\nseveral compartments or cells, each with one or more _ovules_, which are\r\nonly immature or unfertilized seeds, often very tiny, but usually quite\r\neasily seen if the ovary is cut open. It is the entrance of the pollen\r\ngrain into this ovule that consummates the act of fertilization. As the\r\novule is carefully secreted within the ovary of the flower, and as the\r\nmale fertilizing stuff or pollen is found only on the anther, it is\r\nobvious that some method of bringing the two together must be provided\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nIn some plants this is accomplished by the anthers being just above the\r\nstigma, and when the pollen is ripe and the ovule ready, the stigma is\r\nfound to be covered with a sticky substance. As the falling pollen\r\ngrains touch the stigma, they are caught in this sticky substance just\r\nas surely as flies are caught once they touch a fly paper. But just here\r\none of the most wonderful processes of nature begins. The pollen grain\r\nbegins, slowly at first, to grow, and in the act it penetrates the outer\r\ncoat of the stigma with a minute _pollen tube_. This slender threadlike\r\ntube, carrying with it the male germ, grows straight down through the\r\nstigma, into the narrowed style, and through this to the ovule. Once the\r\npollen is caught on the stigma, nothing is so sure of fulfillment as\r\nthat this male fertilizing stuff will ultimately reach the ovule. For\r\nthe hitherto virgin ovule this impregnation starts a new phase in life.\r\nIt means the beginning of the end, but in the process fruit and seed\r\nwill be developed, and the young bride, already a mother, has\r\ntriumphantly accomplished that for which she exists.\r\n\r\nIf fertilization of all flowers were as simple as this, there would be\r\nno need of what follows, but actually in surprisingly few plants are the\r\nstamens and pistils so arranged, the ripening of the pollen and\r\nreadiness of the ovule for impregnation so timed that the act can be\r\naccomplished in such direct fashion. For it is quite obvious that in\r\nflowers in which the whole drama of mating goes on within the petals,\r\nwithout the interference or help of any outside agency, the result will\r\nbe a crop of young who know no other characters than those of the\r\nparents, and have nothing to look forward to but a closely inbreeding\r\nprogeny, very little, if at all different from themselves. In other\r\nwords, such plants are pure bred, they lack the usually obvious virility\r\nthat comes from crossing the male of one plant with the female of\r\nanother. There are so many devices to prevent self-fertilization in\r\nflowers, so marvelous are the contrivances to see to it that only\r\ncross-fertilization can be effective, and, finally, the experience of\r\nbreeders that strength and virility often or usually result from\r\nimpregnating the ovules of one plant with the pollen of another, that we\r\nare forced to the conclusion that absolute purity in the sexual\r\nrelations of flowers is rare indeed. It occurs, without peradventure of\r\na doubt, only in those flowers whose petals never open and where\r\nfertilization is consummated, if not in private, at any rate without\r\nexternal help. In many violets the showy violet blossoms are often\r\nnearly infertile, while down near the ground are inconspicuous flowers\r\nwhich never open, but within which fertilization is so successful that\r\nthe crop of seeds is far more plentiful than in the more showy ones that\r\nmost people think are the only flowers ever borne by violets. These\r\nflowers that never open, or at any rate open so slightly that their\r\nsexual processes are modestly completed without intrusion, are known as\r\n_cleistogamous_ flowers (Figure 69). They have been found in a few\r\nplants, but overwhelmingly the greater number of flowers not only do,\r\nbut must, rely on some outside agency to insure fertilization.\r\n\r\nCertain structural features of flowers have been so developed that\r\nfertilization of the ovary by the pollen of the same flower is\r\nimpossible. The commonest case is in those flowers where the stamens are\r\nshorter than the pistils, as they always are in the common snowdrop,\r\nhyacinth, the sassafras tree, and in hundreds of others. There can be\r\nno consummation of the reproductive process in such flowers without some\r\noutside aid. More futile still without this aid are those flowers where\r\nthe stamens are well above the pistils, but the time of maturing in both\r\ndiffers by a few days or even hours. Nothing could be more\r\nhelpless than the pistil under these circumstances, for if\r\nits instinct for maternity were ever so strong, it would be doomed to\r\nbarren sterility by the premature development of the males. Sometimes,\r\ntoo, the female is prematurely ripe for impregnation, and the stamens\r\nlag behind a day or two. Her time passes and with it her only chance of\r\nfertilization--by her own haste she has rendered impotent the now\r\nuseless pollen which appears doomed to fall aimlessly upon the\r\nunreceptive stigma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69--THE VIOLET\r\n\r\nNote the showy, often partly infertile upper flowers and the much\r\nsmaller cleistogamous ones at the base, which never open and yet produce\r\na good crop of seeds.]\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, the most hopeless of all is the well-known partridge\r\nberry, whose red berries are common in the woods during August and\r\nSeptember. This seems as though it fought off any chance of securing a\r\nmate by a flower structure and behavior that would certainly so result\r\nif some way out of the difficulty were not at hand. The partridge berry\r\nbears two kinds of flowers that outwardly look much alike, but whose\r\nsexual organs differ in this way: in some flowers the stamens are all\r\nshorter than the pistil, and in others the pistil is much outtopped by\r\nthe stamens. The extraordinary feature of it is not so much this\r\nstructural difference, however, but the fact that pollen from the\r\nshort-stamened flower is useful only to its neighboring short-styled\r\nrelative, while the pollen from this long-stamened but short-styled\r\nneighbor is nearly useless where it is found and really useful only on\r\nthe long-styled plant. By this device, but again only with outside aid,\r\nthis plant does not prevent maternity, but increases its chances of\r\nbeing fruitful, for, as we have already seen, cross-fertilization\r\nappears to be the rule rather than the exception, and the partridge\r\nberry not only needs it, but can exist only when its offspring are the\r\nresult of such crosses.\r\n\r\nIn all those plants that bear the different sexes in different flowers\r\non the same plant, as in the hickory, or even on different plants, as in\r\nthe willow, there must, of course, be some method arranged for\r\ncross-fertilization or they would promptly die out. So general is this\r\ncross-fertilization, so much a part of the economy of nature does it\r\nappear to be, that we can only think that there must be in the\r\nproduction of this vast horde of the cross-fertilized some advantage.\r\nBesides securing greater virility, which almost certainly results from\r\nthis promiscuity, greater variability is promoted. If virility is the\r\nresult, the price paid for it is tremendous, for the hindrances to\r\nself-fertilization are so many and so effective that most flowers would\r\ninevitably die as perfectly pure but ineffectual virgins if that\r\nfatality were not prevented. How they are saved from such a sterile\r\nfate, how they finally secure a mate by devices that outshine the most\r\nbewitching tricks of the daughters of Eve, is one of the most\r\nfascinating stories in all the history of the plant world.\r\n\r\nFor, of course, flowers do secure a mate, and they are aided in this\r\nenterprise by the most formidable array of helpers, one might almost\r\ncall them conspirators. The chief of these are insects, thousands of\r\ndifferent kinds of which are constant flower visitors. Some of the\r\nsmaller birds, and even snails, also help flowers to meet their mates.\r\nThe wind, too, bears pollen through the air to some expectant\r\nbride-to-be. And, finally, in the water, by a series of acts the like of\r\nwhich no one could improve for cunning, the cross-fertilization of\r\ncertain aquatic plants is consummated. It would take a book larger than\r\nthe present one to give even the briefest account of how these different\r\naids to maternity do their work and how the flower responds to this\r\nhelp. As that is quite out of the question, only some of the best-known\r\nexamples of cross-fertilization will be given, and these will be grouped\r\naccording to what agency the flower is indebted for its chance of doing\r\nthat for which it is created.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS AS FLOWER VISITORS\r\n\r\nOn any summer day, especially when the sun is shining brightly, we may\r\nsee bees and butterflies flitting from flower to flower, busy as the\r\nproverbial bee. We already know enough about nature’s ways of doing\r\nthings to be certain that these, and hundreds of other kinds of insects,\r\ndo not come for nothing, and that the flower must have something to\r\noffer. Bees, especially, are thrifty creatures whose business demands\r\nexacting and prolonged toil. They would not waste five seconds upon idle\r\nflower calling if the blossoms did not yield a rich store. And thousands\r\nof flowers do yield the sweetest and richest kinds of stores of nectar\r\nor honey, which is, in fact, by the help of insects who alone can\r\nextract it, our sole source of honey. Many flowers which produce no\r\nnectar do have such plentiful stocks of pollen that the bees come for\r\nthat alone. In the peony, for instance, over three million pollen grains\r\nare produced in each flower, only a minute fraction of which can ever\r\nfertilize an ovule. All the rest would be wasted were not pollen in\r\nitself a particularly nutritious food for young bees, and consequently\r\nmuch sought after by the careful bee mothers. They are the only insects\r\nthat feed their young on pollen, or beebread, as it is called by the\r\nbeekeepers, so that the enormous overproduction of this male fertilizing\r\nagent, from the point of view of the flower, is a decided attraction,\r\none might almost call it a trap, to insure constant visitations from\r\nbees. For they are perhaps the most useful of all insects in the great\r\ngame of securing cross-fertilization, as we shall presently see. Many\r\nother kinds of adult insects eat pollen directly and so add to the\r\nnumber of insect visitors.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever been able to explain the beautiful coloring of flowers,\r\nexcept that it serves as an attraction for insects and small birds. Like\r\nthe honey or nectar, it seems to play no real part in the home economy\r\nof the flower, to be of not the least use otherwise. While honey and the\r\ngorgeous colors of flowers are a delight to man, that would be no\r\nsufficient reason for the ability to produce them. Both of these\r\nattributes of flowers, as attractions for insect visitors, are, however,\r\nso absolutely essential to cross-fertilization that we must think of\r\nthem as having grown up out of that demand. As we shall see a little\r\nlater, even the structure of some insects has been modified so that they\r\ncan reach the nectar or pollen only by automatically doing for the\r\nflower what it cannot do itself.\r\n\r\nWhile color of flowers seems as though it were attraction enough, it is\r\nvery likely that their fragrance or perfume is still more seductive in\r\nits power of luring insect visitors and repelling useless ones. Poets\r\nhave called this perfume the soul of the flower, and in its almost\r\nintangible beauty it might well be so called were it not for the fact\r\nthat it appears to be of not the slightest use, except as a lure. In all\r\nthe equipment of seduction there is none like this fragrance of flowers\r\nfor attracting insects.\r\n\r\nFlowers, then, have things to offer to insects which the latter need.\r\nNectar and pollen are the chief, and where these merely bread and butter\r\nobjects are not enough, or sometimes in addition to them, the flower is\r\ndressed out in gorgeous colors or perfumed with a fragrance beyond the\r\ndreams of the fairest bride. What insects do to complete the\r\nfertilization of such a legion of beauties makes up the romance of the\r\nflowers. Perhaps not even in man himself is this creation of new life so\r\nsurrounded with beautiful ideas. Also, as in man, it sometimes is bound\r\nup with an almost fiendish cruelty and cunning. Some of these visitors\r\nand what they do, but unfortunately only a very few, can be mentioned\r\nhere. They must serve as types or examples of what is going on all about\r\nus on any summer day.\r\n\r\nThe common blue columbine, much grown in gardens for its beautiful\r\nblossoms, always has the flowers hanging upside down, a habit that\r\nadmirably serves to keep its pollen from rain. The opening and closing\r\nof many flowers in cloudy weather, or at night, may be for the same\r\nreason. Everyone knows the five blue spurs into which the petals of\r\ncolumbine are produced. At the very end of each spur, which is always\r\ncurved, the flower secretes a considerable quantity of honey. This, one\r\nof the greatest attractions to bees, leads inevitably to a visit from\r\none. The bee, in order to reach the honey, hangs on to the inverted\r\nflowers, clutching the base of the spur with its foreleg, and further\r\nsecuring itself by the mid or hind legs, which grasp the slender column\r\ninto which, in the columbine, the stamens and pistils are crowded. In\r\nits anxiety to reach the honey the bee pokes its head as far into the\r\nspur as possible, but it gets in only a fraction of the full length of\r\nthe tube. To reach the honey it extends its sucking apparatus, which is\r\na complicated mechanism for this purpose on the head of nearly all\r\ninsects, and which will hereafter be called by its true name of\r\n_proboscis_. It happens that bees can easily bend the proboscis downward\r\nor toward their own body, but only with considerable difficulty can they\r\nbend it in the opposite way. And yet the honey in the curved tip of the\r\ncolumbine can _only_ be reached by curving the proboscis to fit the\r\ntube, and in this process the bee’s body for nearly half its length is\r\nforced to touch the anthers. While these are close to the stigma, they\r\nproduce pollen only on their outside surface, where it is, of course,\r\nscarcely likely to reach the stigma, but must be brushed off by the\r\ncontortions of the bee’s body in reaching the honey. The hairy body of\r\nthe bee, coated with pollen, goes next to perhaps an older flower of the\r\ncolumbine. Heedless of any change in the flower the bee goes straight\r\nfor the honey in one of the spurs, again catches hold of the only\r\navailable support in the center of the flower. But this time, instead of\r\nbrushing pollen off the exposed anthers, it brushes it off its own body\r\nto the stigmas, which, at a slightly later stage than in the one just\r\ndescribed, are branched and perfectly adapted for collecting the pollen\r\nwith which the bepowdered bee can hardly avoid dusting them.\r\nCross-fertilization is of course assured, but it seems a precarious\r\nbusiness at best, as the number of bees with a proboscis long enough to\r\ndo the work is limited. The columbine, by a kind of uncanny foresight,\r\nis so constructed that bees or other insects that try to reach the honey\r\nand are not provided with a sufficiently long proboscis, nevertheless in\r\nfurther attempts upon other flowers, inevitably cross-fertilize them\r\nwithout reaping their reward. One or two kinds of bees, as though in\r\nretaliation for this subterfuge of the columbine, make short work of the\r\nhoney by biting a hole in the spur and forthwith sucking out the honey\r\nwithout so much as touching anther, pollen, or stigma. The reply of the\r\ncolumbine to this ravaging of its chief attraction is that finally, as a\r\nlast resort, and by a new movement of its reproductive organs, it is\r\nself-fertilized. Here the shape of the flower, the original position of\r\nthe pistil and anthers, the exposure of pollen only in such a direction\r\nthat, while a chance of cross-fertilization still exists, it can hardly\r\never fertilize its own stigmas, all point to cross-fertilization as the\r\nplant’s greatest requirement. And yet failing this, it falls back on\r\nself-fertilization rather than endure barren sterility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--COMMON BARBERRY\r\n\r\nThe stamens of this, two at a time, drive off bees by sharp blows, thus\r\npreventing self-fertilization.]\r\n\r\nWhile the columbine by its spurs and other interior structure succeeds\r\nnearly always in holding a bee long enough to insure its being dusted\r\nwith pollen, the common barberry bush of Europe (Figure 70), also much\r\nplanted in American gardens for ornament, actually drives bees away by\r\nsharp blows of its stamens, so that self-fertilization shall not result\r\nfrom the visit. In this shrub the petals partly cover the stamens unless\r\nthe latter are disturbed, and, in fact, the curved tip of the petals\r\nforms a kind of socket into which each of the six stamens are fitted.\r\nThe position of these is such that any insect\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANTS OF THE PALM FAMILY, _Palmaceæ_, in Ceylon.

(_Courtesy of Brooklyn Botanic\r\nGarden._)]\r\n\r\ncan go straight to the honey glands which are at the base of the flower,\r\nwithout touching the anthers. But their filaments are broadened out at\r\nthe base, so much so that their edges touch. The honey glands are so\r\nplaced that the insect must touch the broad bases of at least two\r\nfilaments, between which, in fact, it must force its proboscis in order\r\nto reach the honey. The moment any particular pair of filaments are\r\nirritated by the bee, two pollen-dusted stamens fly out from their\r\nposition among the petals and the anthers strike the bee with a sharp\r\nblow. Many observations prove that almost never does the bee go on with\r\nhis honey sucking after this rude interruption, which has resulted in at\r\nleast its head being dusted with pollen. The low, sticky stigma is so\r\nplaced that it is one of the first things the bee’s head strikes as it\r\nreaches the center of the flower. Because of the position of the\r\nstamens, while they are undisturbed, it is impossible that pollen from\r\nthem could have been brushed off at the bee’s entrance of the flower.\r\nAnd by an almost miraculous adjustment of the power of the blow by the\r\nirritated stamens, this drives off the intruder only after he has\r\nbrushed his pollen-laden head over the stigma. His head at this stage\r\nis, of course, covered only with foreign pollen gathered elsewhere, but\r\njust as soon as the bee tries to get what he came for, sometimes even\r\nbefore he gets his reward, out fly the pair of stamens, thoroughly\r\ndusting the bee, and seeing to it that the blow is just sufficient to\r\ndrive off the pollen-laden insect. No device to secure\r\ncross-fertilization could be more effective. If the blow of the stamen\r\nwere only ever such a slight fraction less than it is, the bee would\r\nonly stop a moment and then go on honey sucking; which, because of the\r\nrelease of the pollen by even the gentlest blow, would result in\r\nself-fertilization by the aid of the bee, rather than\r\ncross-fertilization. Very few, if any, bees will stand this gentle\r\nreminder to go, however, and it is a little curious that such\r\nintelligent creatures as they are supposed to be, should not realize\r\nthat it is all the clever but quite harmless trick of an apparently\r\nstill more intelligent flower to secure fertilization from any pollen\r\nbut its own.\r\n\r\nTo attract insects and then repel them seems a little like using them as\r\nsome flirts notoriously use men, only to throw them over when they are\r\nno longer interesting. In the large-flowered magnolia tree from the\r\nsoutheastern United States, insects, however, fare somewhat better than\r\nthis. In this magnolia, which has flowers several inches long,\r\nself-fertilization is impossible as the stigmas are ready to receive a\r\nmate several days before the laggard stamens are provided with the\r\nwherewithal. Without some insect or other outside help there would be\r\nonly a childless old age for this particular tree. The flower opens\r\nrather early in the season, while the nights are still cool, and as a\r\nprotection from the cold, rose beetles habitually fly into them. They\r\nfind a pleasant shelter under the three inner petals which arch over the\r\nhoney-coated stigma, and form a snug little chamber so much warmer than\r\nthe outer air that its heat is appreciable to the touch. The rose\r\nbeetles, once they are inside this warm shelter, cannot get out and are\r\noften held for a few days. Then, as the stigma passes its period and the\r\nstamens are furnished with pollen, the chamber opens by the gradual\r\nwithering of the petals. But the insects, in their efforts to get out,\r\nhave raised a perfect dust storm of pollen with which they are\r\nnaturally covered. Just as soon as they are released they are free to\r\nseek another warm shelter where the process is repeated. Thus they\r\nalways enter the flower with foreign pollen, use it up impregnating the\r\nwaiting ovule, and are held until the flower’s own pollen gives the\r\nsignal for their release properly dusted for a renewal of the work. The\r\npremature timing of the stigma, the tardiness of the anther in producing\r\npollen, the generation of heat and secretion of honey which frequently\r\ncovers the whole stigma--there could scarcely be a better equipment for\r\nsecuring cross-fertilization. And without it the magnolia would be\r\nsimply sterile.\r\n\r\nThere are some other flowers that hold visiting insects in a trap until\r\ncross-fertilization has been completed, and all of them by no means\r\nfurnish their visitors such a snug little heated chamber as the\r\nmagnolia. One vine from the eastern United States, known as the\r\nDutchman’s-pipe, or sometimes as the pipevine (Figure 71), is singularly\r\nruthless in this respect. Its flowers are of such evil odor that only\r\ncarrion-loving insects, such as certain kinds of flies and gnats, ever\r\nvisit them. The flower is of very peculiar structure, being formed of a\r\nhollow tube bent from its stalk first downward, and then upward. The\r\nupper part ends at the opening which is provided with a three-lobed lip\r\nor doorway. Through this the insects crawl, and they finally reach the\r\nbottom of the curved part of the flower. Behind and above them is the\r\nentrance through which they have just come. And above them, in the other\r\ncurved part of the flower, is the stigma. As in the magnolia, this\r\nmatures several days before the pollen from its surrounding stamens is\r\nripe, so that self-fertilization is never possible. What is now the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--THE DUTCHMAN’S-PIPE\r\n\r\nA vine producing evil-smelling flowers, which trap insects sometimes for\r\ndays, thus insuring cross-fertilization.]\r\n\r\nplight of the insect at the bottom of the upward-pointing tubes, one\r\nleading to the organs of reproduction, the other to the exit? By an\r\nalmost diabolical cunning the inside of this flower is so smooth that no\r\ninsect can crawl up its slippery sides. It takes some time for the\r\nprisoner to find this out, and, in the meantime, it has explored every\r\nnook and corner of the flower by flying. In the course of this\r\nexploration it reaches and covers the stigma with pollen, for as we\r\nshall see presently, it always comes _into_ the flower pollen-laden.\r\nEvidently becoming panicky about getting out, the insect then flies with\r\nvery considerable force in every direction. Toward the true exit it\r\nnaturally flies the most, and by a refinement of cruelty this is the\r\nlighter end of the flower, and therefore the obvious mode of escape for\r\nit. But the three lips and the entrance they cover are not flat across\r\nthe flower, as the cover of a lunch box would normally be, but turned at\r\nsuch an angle as the lunch box would be if set on end. The insect, in\r\nflying toward the light, invariably hits the smooth surface just inside\r\nthe three lips and falls to the bottom of the flower because there is\r\nnothing rough enough for it to cling to. Throughout most of the day, and\r\nsometimes for several days, the insect will keep up this ceaseless\r\nstruggle to escape, flying first up one tube and then the other. These\r\nfrantic efforts would end in exhaustion if kept up too long, and before\r\nthat happens, but after the impregnated ovules have no further use for\r\nthe flies, the anthers give forth plentiful supplies of pollen. Of\r\ncourse, the insect can scarcely avoid becoming covered with this, and\r\nthen, but only then, the flower begins to wither and up its now wrinkled\r\nsides the pollen-laden prisoner can at last crawl to liberty.\r\n\r\nThere appears nothing very romantic about the cross-fertilization of the\r\nDutchman’s pipe, in fact, the whole affair seems but a sordid and, it\r\nmust be confessed, a very efficient trick to get what the flower needs\r\nfrom the insect, rewarding it by many hours of apparently hopeless\r\ncaptivity. But most flowers do have something that insects want, and\r\nnone so well fulfill the expectations of butterflies as the meadow pink.\r\nThis is a graceful little perennial native in the fields in central\r\nEurope, but often grown in American flower gardens. It has beautiful\r\npink flowers, with a long tubular calyx, at the bottom of which are rich\r\nhoney glands, accessible only to the long proboscis of different kinds\r\nof butterflies. No other insects, and many try, are able to get the\r\nhoney from this plant. It begins flowering by opening its five\r\nbeautifully fringed petals, all of which are marked with lines from\r\ntheir edge toward the center. These obvious “pathfinders” are common on\r\nmany other flowers and all seem to be there to act as a guide for\r\nalighting insects, and, as it were, steer them to the center of the\r\nflower. As a butterfly alights he finds five protruding anthers covered\r\nwith pollen. These are of no use to him, but nevertheless his head is\r\ncovered by their pollen. In fact, many other visitors, who can never\r\nreach the honey, find the bright color and good stocks of pollen\r\nsufficient attraction for them, and after a pollen feast fly off to\r\nother flowers. If the butterfly comes at this state of the flower’s\r\nlife, it pokes its long proboscis down into the tube of the calyx, but\r\nfinds the passage almost blocked by another set of five stamens not yet\r\nready to discharge pollen, and, as though ashamed of the fact, quite\r\nhidden from view. Also, the proboscis is very nearly stopped by the\r\nstyle, which, if its stigmas were ready for mating, would then and there\r\nbecome impregnated. But they are rolled together into a tight spiral,\r\nand their pollen-receptive faces tightly pressed together in addition to\r\nthe whole structure being twisted, so that the very probably\r\npollen-laden proboscis of the butterfly finally gets to the honey\r\nwithout leaving one grain of pollen where it could possibly\r\nself-fertilize the flower. Honey-laden, it now flies away, and so far as\r\nthis particular flower is concerned, simply nothing has happened but to\r\ncoat several insects with pollen. A little later the anthers of the\r\nfirst set of stamens cease work and drop off. Then the five stamens\r\nhitherto hidden in the calyx burst out and furnish a second crop of\r\npollen, but the stigmas are still safely coiled away from the possible\r\ndanger of self-impregnation. During this second stage the flower may\r\nrepeatedly be visited, but until this second crop of anthers become\r\nuseless there is not the slightest risk of the stigmas becoming\r\nself-fertilized. For the hole through which the second set of stamens\r\nhas come is so small that still only the proboscis of the butterfly can\r\npenetrate it. When finally the second crop of anthers also fall off,\r\nthen the style slowly uncoils and thrusts its now receptive stigmas\r\nabove the calyx and in plain view of passing visitors. These come,\r\npollen-laden of course, from other flowers, and cross-fertilization is\r\nassured. Here the flower furnishes two crops of pollen, plentiful\r\nsupplies of honey, and asks only that in gathering these the butterflies\r\nsee to it that its stigma be covered only with foreign pollen. Keeping\r\ncarefully out of the way while they are about their business and there\r\nis danger of self-fertilization, they come out boldly once that danger\r\nis past. In this meadow pink self-fertilization is simply impossible;\r\neverything in the production of its young it owes to the butterflies, to\r\nwhich it surely makes adequate returns.\r\n\r\nWhile such plants as the meadow pink and thousands of others have lost,\r\nif they ever possessed, the power of self-fertilization, and rely\r\nabsolutely on insect visitors for their perpetuation, there are many\r\nhundreds of kinds that apparently hope for cross-fertilization, but, in\r\ndefault of it, due to their inability to absolutely compel it, they\r\nfinally accept self-fertilization as a last resort. Darwin once said\r\nthat “Nature abhors perpetual self-fertilization,” and the frequent\r\nvisits of insects and their rôle in preventing it, together with the\r\nflowers’ adaptations to such visits, support the contention, which has\r\nnever been seriously questioned. But some flowers appear to have left\r\nthe back door open, as it were, so that failing cross-fertilization,\r\nthey may still rely upon self-fertilization. A geranium from the\r\nPyrenees, a relative of our common woods geranium, is of this type. A\r\nday or two before its stigmas are ripe it produces first one set of five\r\nanthers, all pollen-coated, and then another. If these have not been\r\nbrushed clean, as often or usually happens, then the stigmas ripen and,\r\nof course, are impregnated by their pollen. If they are brushed clean of\r\npollen, then the stigmas must rely on foreign pollen, of which it is\r\nassured a supply from the visits of pollen-laden insects from other\r\nflowers, which are still attracted by the flowers’ color and honey.\r\nPerpetuation is assured, in any case, but the preference is still for\r\ncross-fertilization.\r\n\r\nA more remarkable case of leaving one final chance for\r\nself-fertilization is the gas plant. It exhales such a strong and\r\npeculiar odor that only certain kinds of insects will visit it. In fact,\r\nthe odor is so strong and is so heavily charged that a lighted match\r\nheld near it has been known to slightly ignite--hence the plant’s name.\r\nThe flower bears a low, squat stigma, profusely covered with honey,\r\nwhich is perfectly accessible to any insect visitor. It has ten stamens,\r\nwhich at first are quite out of the way of insects, two being folded\r\nback in each of the five yellow petals. First one stamen begins moving\r\ngently from the shelter of its petal, and the anther, pollen-coated,\r\nhovers over the stigma, which would inevitably lead to\r\nself-fertilization if the stigma were only ready. It never is, and, as\r\nthough realizing this, the stamen gently moves back out of the way,\r\nstill, in most cases, retaining some of its pollen. Then another tries\r\nand, again, as though realizing the futility of impregnating the\r\nunreceptive stigma, it also moves back. So it goes with all the other\r\neight stamens, each of which moves gently out over the stigma, and\r\ngently back again, all of them failing to fertilize the laggard stigma.\r\nBut there has been during all this time a constant procession of insects\r\ncoming for the honey, and never for a moment have the stamens been off\r\nguard, so that each visitor goes off with at least some pollen clinging\r\nto it. Finally the stigma, after all the faithful ten are folded back\r\namong the petals, comes into its period, and is cross-fertilized by the\r\ninsects which come from other flowers laden with pollen, as we now know.\r\nBut if, by one of those accidents of nature, such as bad weather or what\r\nnot, no insect ever does come, what then is to be the fate of the\r\nstigma? Has it staked all only to lose out in the end? It would almost\r\nseem that to ignore the steady attentions of the willing ten might make\r\nbarren sterility a fitting punishment. But, in spite of what has\r\nhappened, the stamens come to the rescue, if all insects fail, and this\r\ntime, in a body, they rise up and shed upon the stigma from the\r\nhalf-withered anthers their few remaining pollen grains. There could be\r\nno finer example of having an anchor to windward.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest families of flowering plants is the pea family\r\n(Figure 72), with over five thousand members, practically all of which\r\nrely on bees for cross-fertilization. In some kinds, where bees\r\noccasionally fail them, the flowers wither without self-fertilization\r\nand, of course, no seed are then produced. In such a large family of\r\nplants there are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--THE EVERLASTING OR PERENNIAL PEA\r\n\r\nA member of the Papilionaceæ or pea family which rely almost entirely on\r\nbees for fertilization.]\r\n\r\nnaturally many different adaptations for securing\r\ncross-fertilization--some of them of such extreme complexity that they\r\ncould hardly be included here. All the family have the characteristic\r\npealike flowers familiar enough in the sweet pea, which have already\r\nbeen described and figured on page 44. In all of these stamens and\r\npistils are hidden inside the keel, at least in the early stages of the\r\nflower. In some, such as clovers, for instance, the organs emerge from\r\nthe keel, and after fertilization by insects re-enter their retreat.\r\nThere are scores of different plans for securing the desired object, but\r\nthe common alfalfa, with a few other related plants, has the most\r\nstartling. The flower begins life with its stamens and pistils\r\nconcealed within the keel, which is apparently impregnable. When a bee\r\nalights on the flower and begins work he is welcomed by a small but\r\nviolent explosion. When the dust of this clears away, and it is actually\r\ndusty with pollen, the dazed bee is seen to have fertilized with almost\r\ninstantaneous rapidity the stigma of the exploding flower, which springs\r\nviolently out of the burst keel. This is so arranged that, as it flies\r\nout of its trap, due to the explosion touched off by the bee, it strikes\r\nthe under side of the bee’s body a distinct blow, brushing off in the\r\nprocess the pollen nearly always found there. This pollen has come from\r\nother plants. But, as in most plants of the pea family, the stamens\r\nclosely surround the stigma, but are shorter than it. When the explosion\r\noccurs, the stigma, because it is slightly longer than the stamens, is\r\nthe first thing to strike the bee’s body. Already impregnated, it is\r\nthen indifferent to the cloud of pollen from the stamens of its own\r\nflower, which only a fraction of a second later also strikes the bee’s\r\nbody. The first flower that a bee visits cannot, of course, be\r\ncross-fertilized notwithstanding the explosion which results, no matter\r\nfrom what angle the bee attempts to insert its proboscis. But in this\r\ncase, as the stigma is unfertilized by foreign pollen, its own performs\r\nthat service. In the vast majority of cases cross-fertilization is\r\nassured by certainly the most novel of processes, and, in the rare event\r\nof the bee not being covered with foreign pollen, self-fertilization is\r\nstill possible.\r\n\r\nIn many of the plants already noted cross-fertilization is accomplished\r\nby virtue of the fact that the stamens mature before the stigma. But in\r\nthe common strawberry the reverse is true. As the insect stands on the\r\nwhite petals, it must, in order to reach the honey at the base of the\r\nflower, put its head down so that if pollen were available there could\r\nonly result self-fertilization. But while the stigma is ready, the\r\npollen at this stage never is, and the insect which comes usually laden\r\nwith pollen from other flowers cannot avoid impregnating the stigma with\r\nthis foreign pollen. Later the stamens mature and, as insect visits\r\ncontinue so long as honey is to be found, they become dusted with pollen\r\nwhich is used for the fertilization of other plants. Scores of other\r\nplants also produce ripened stigmas before the pollen matures, and they\r\nmust rely on insects to cross-fertilize them.\r\n\r\nThe cross-fertilization of the strawberry is such a comparatively simple\r\nprocess--seems in fact almost inevitable--that we are lost in wonder at\r\nthe almost mathematical complexity of the act in the common purple\r\nloosestrife, which has been introduced into American gardens from\r\nEurope, and sometimes runs wild. In this plant there is a long terminal\r\nspike of showy, purplish-pink flowers, the color of which is sufficient\r\nto attract many insects from even a fairly swift flight. The petals are\r\nstreaked with “pathfinders” toward the center of the flower. This\r\nconsists of a tubular calyx; at the bottom of this is the honey, which\r\nsecures the insect’s further interest once the color has attracted it.\r\nBut it finds a condition of the reproductive organs almost without\r\nparallel. In some plants the style is hidden down in the calyx tube,\r\nwhile one set of stamens just peep out of the end of the tube, and a\r\nsecond set are still further and quite obviously protruded. In a\r\nneighboring plant the style will be found outside the tube, one set of\r\nstamens hidden in it, and the other set outtopping everything, except\r\nthe petals. In still a third type of the loosestrife, the style exceeds\r\neverything but the petals, one set of stamens just emerge from the tube\r\nand the lowest set are hidden. It would appear as if the loosestrife\r\ncould scarcely escape self-fertilization, except possibly in that form\r\nwhere the stigma outtops all the stamens, and this would result always\r\nif the pollen were indiscriminately useful from all three lengths of\r\nstamens. But it never is, only that from the short-stamened plants will\r\nfertilize the short-styled one, the mid-stamened ones the mid-styled\r\ncounterpart, and the long-stamened ones the long-styled flower. The\r\npollen grains of the different-lengthed stamens are even of different\r\nsize and color. If this were not so, it is a simple mathematical problem\r\nthat, with three different sets of style lengths and six sets of\r\nstamens, two in each flower, eighteen different crosses might be\r\npossible. As it is, only six crosses are ever possible and these only by\r\nthe aid of insects, for it must be remembered that stamens and pistils\r\nof the same length are never found in the same flower. By an adjustment\r\nof the size of the body of the different insect visitors it works out so\r\nthat, while all three body sizes frequently visit each flower, only that\r\nparticular size of insect suited to the carrying of pollen from stamens\r\nof one definite length to a style of similar length actually\r\naccomplishes the cross-fertilization of that particular flower. And this\r\nwithout interfering with the visit of another different-sized insect\r\nwhich will accomplish the work for its particular set of stamens and\r\npistils. So marvelous is the adjustment of style length and stamen\r\nlength to each particular body size of the visiting insects, so perfect\r\nis the arrangement of the organs in each flower, that each contributes\r\nto the fertilization of its neighbors, never to its own, nor does it\r\ninterfere with the process in other lengthened styles.\r\nCross-fertilization is thus almost always accomplished in the six\r\ndifferent combinations possible in this truly remarkable case of\r\nadaptation between insects and flowers.\r\n\r\nFrom the almost mathematical complications of the cross-fertilization of\r\nthe loosestrife it seems a far cry indeed to that of the Italian\r\nhoneysuckle. This often runs wild over fences, but is unlike the more\r\nwidely known Japanese honeysuckle, in that its stem passes through the\r\ndifferent pairs of opposite, bluish-green leaves, which are joined\r\ntogether at the base. The Italian honeysuckle falls back on the more\r\nsimple seductions of odor and honey for securing its really important\r\ninsect visitors. It has such a long tube that only certain night-or\r\nevening-flying moths or butterflies can reach the honey. There is, even\r\nduring the day, such a plentiful supply of this that it frequently fills\r\nhalf the tube, but even then it is quite out of reach of bees which\r\nnever succeed in getting any. Toward evening, particularly on quiet,\r\nstill evenings, the flower begins to send off in much increased quantity\r\na heavy rich-scented odor almost overpowering in its sweetness. The\r\nbutterflies and moths of the dusk having a long proboscis, succumb to\r\nthis really enchanting lure, which, with the large store of honey,\r\ninsures quantities of eager suitors. The stigma, while ripening\r\nsimultaneously with the anthers, protrudes beyond them, so that the\r\nbutterflies touch pollen only _after_ touching the stigma, which of\r\ncourse is impregnated with pollen from an earlier visit of the insect to\r\na different flower. So assiduous are the butterflies, that on a still\r\nnight there will be not one grain of pollen left on the much-brushed\r\nanthers. If the night is cold or windy much pollen remains and\r\ncross-fertilization is left to pollen-eating insects such as mother bees\r\nor flies. While these can never get the honey they often do accomplish\r\ncross-fertilization and, sometimes by misadventure, self-pollination. It\r\nis only those moths and butterflies which, forcing their long proboscis\r\ndown the honey-laden tube, must accomplish cross-fertilization. But\r\nfailing this, the plant is more or less at the mercy of hosts of insect\r\ntriflers, mere pollen eaters, who may or may not insure\r\ncross-fertilization, but in any case provide for self-fertilization.\r\n\r\nAnother use which certain plants make of honey, besides acting as a lure\r\nof insects, is found in the common lilac. The flower in this has\r\nconsiderable honey at the bottom of the tube, which can only be reached\r\nby insects with a proboscis sufficiently long to reach it. The lilac has\r\nonly two stamens inserted near the top of the tube, the passage to which\r\nthey very nearly obstruct. The stigma is hidden in the tube, and it\r\nmatures simultaneously with the ripening of the pollen. As the insect\r\ninserts its proboscis between the stamens no pollen clings to it due to\r\nthe character of the pollen grains. But as the proboscis is withdrawn\r\nfrom the tube its lower end is covered with honey to which pollen\r\nsticks. If a needle is inserted between the stamens and pushed only far\r\nenough to be still clear of the honey, no pollen will be found on it\r\nwhen withdrawn, but if pushed all the way down, its honey-coated point\r\nwill catch considerable pollen. In the lilac, if insect visitors do not\r\naccomplish the work of cross-fertilization, the flower is\r\nself-fertilized ultimately by the protruding of the stigma far enough\r\nout of the tube to catch some of the remaining pollen grains.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps useless to multiply instances of flowers which by various\r\ndevices secure the cooperation of insects in getting pollen from a\r\nforeign source. To recapitulate some of those devices it is necessary\r\nonly to recall what some flowers have done to force cross-fertilization.\r\nThe heated chamber of the magnolia, the cruelty of the prison cell in\r\nDutchman’s-pipe, the blow from the stamen of the barberry, the faithful\r\nrotation of the ten stamens of the gas plant, the explosive flower in\r\nsome members of the pea family, the lure of honey and seductive odor of\r\nthe Italian honeysuckle, the mathematical complexity of the\r\nloosestrife--these and hundreds of others all point to the necessity of\r\ncross-fertilization and a means to produce it almost beyond belief.\r\nThere is the best of evidence that not only flowers but insects\r\nthemselves have been modified in this great work, and that for every\r\nflower needing cross-fertilization some agency has been developed to\r\nsecure it. Insects, beyond all other animal life, do this work, but it\r\nis accomplished by humming birds often, and in one plant even by a\r\nsnail.\r\n\r\nTwo of the very largest plant families, not so far mentioned in this\r\naccount, depend almost absolutely upon insects. In the daisy family,\r\nwith over eleven thousand members, the large heads of flowers, often\r\ncontaining scores of individual flowers, are constantly brushed, over\r\nand over again, by the pollen-coated bodies of insect visitors. And in\r\nall or nearly all orchids (Figures 73-75), comprising over five thousand\r\nkinds, the same process is accomplished. In these plants, in fact, the\r\nact is, if possible, more\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--PINK LADY’S SLIPPER\r\n\r\n(_Cypripedium acaule_)\r\n\r\nA native orchid in northeastern North America.]\r\n\r\ncomplicated than in any so far noted. Darwin’s book, “On the Various\r\nContrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilized by\r\nInsects,” reads like a fairy tale. Yet it is the result of years of\r\npatient observation by incomparably the greatest naturalist of recent\r\ntimes. To it the reader must go for the details of a drama of absorbing\r\ninterest, but too long to sketch even briefly here. Perhaps one\r\nillustration may be mentioned of how far the principle of\r\ncross-fertilization has been carried, and to the deadly effects of its\r\nfailure in at least one case. In a certain orchid from Brazil, known as\r\nbutterfly orchid, the pollen is nearly always carried out of the flower\r\nby an insect visitor, but, if by mischance it is not, and falls on the\r\nstigma, not only does it fail to fertilize the ovules, but it kills the\r\npistil forthwith. There may be a few other cases of such drastic\r\nresults of self-fertilization, but in any case, and disregarding these\r\napparently suicidal fanatics, cross-fertilization is so very nearly\r\nuniversal that nature must find it of enormous advantage. Only in this\r\nway is it possible to explain the intricate adjustments of insects and\r\nflowers, which work together in such wonderful harmony that\r\ncross-fertilization hardly ever fails in those flowers where it appears\r\nto be necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--SHOWY ORCHID\r\n\r\n(_Orchis spectabilis_)\r\n\r\nNative of eastern North America, with showy magenta-pink or white\r\nflowers in a loose raceme.]\r\n\r\nIt must have struck many thoughtful readers to ask a rather obvious\r\nquestion at this point. Why, if untold millions of insects are\r\nconstantly flitting from flower to flower, does not the pollen get\r\nmixed, as it is quite certain that they will not fly from a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--RATTLESNAKE PLANTAIN\r\n\r\n(_Peramium pubescens_)\r\n\r\nOne of the few orchids native in eastern North America, with white\r\nvariegated leaves. It grows in dense patches and bears free-blooming\r\nspikes of whitish flowers.]\r\n\r\ncertain kind of geranium to another similar one for instance, but\r\nperhaps to a rose? The answer to this is simple enough, but its\r\nimplications are limitless. Only pollen of a certain species or variety\r\nis useful to the stigmas of that variety. To practically all others the\r\nstigma is simply unreceptive, except in those closely related plants\r\nthat may all have a common parentage. When crosses between such closely\r\nrelated plants do occur the result is known as a hybrid, which will be\r\nconsidered elsewhere. To this extent, then, flowers are peculiarly\r\nexclusive in their matings and promiscuity occurs in the vast number of\r\ncases only in plants of the same species. We do not yet understand the\r\nimpotence of pollen of one species upon another; all that we do know,\r\nwhich has many times been proved by experiments, is that it fails to\r\nact. If it did act, no one could picture the chaos into which the\r\nvegetative world would be thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIND AND WHAT IT DOES FOR FLOWERS\r\n\r\nWhile, as we have seen, thousands of plants rely upon insects for\r\nproducing their young, still other thousands put everything to the\r\nhazard of the wind. Pollen is so light that it can easily be blown very\r\ngreat distances, and while the wastage is enormous, the process works so\r\nwell that the greater part of the vegetation of the earth is thus\r\nfertilized. This is true not as to the number of different kinds of\r\nplants, for in that respect insect fertilization is more important than\r\nthat accomplished by the wind. But in the number of _individual_ plants\r\nconcerned the wind is incomparably the greatest fertilizing agency that\r\nis known to us. This for the reason that all grasses and sedges, most\r\ncatkin-bearing trees such as oak, hickory, birch, practically all pine\r\ntrees and their relatives rely wholly on the wind for fertilization.\r\n\r\nFor reasons that will be enlarged upon in another chapter, all of these\r\ngreat groups of plants must be considered as of simple structure, some,\r\nlike the pines, relics of a remote past when no flowering plants, as we\r\nknow them to-day, existed on the earth. In any event the reliance upon\r\nthe wind is certainly hazardous, and while it of course insures nearly\r\nuniversal cross-fertilization, it may well result in scanty\r\nfertilization or, in exceptional cases, complete failure of it. Quite\r\nobvious also is the amount and direction of the wind in the process, for\r\nin very open and windy places grasslike vegetation, or at least a\r\npredominance of species fertilized by wind, is likely to be found,\r\nrather than those plants that rely upon insects, that, unable to stand\r\nthe full force of the wind, seek more sheltered places. While such a\r\nthing is not the cause of prairies, or the predominantly grasslike\r\nvegetation along sand dunes, or the exclusive spruce forests of the\r\nbleak and windy north country, it unquestionably aids in maintaining the\r\noften exclusive nature of such pure associations of plants. Over\r\nthousands of square miles on our own great plains or on the steppes of\r\nRussia, both subject to violent winds, the great bulk of the vegetation\r\nis wind fertilized. It could hardly be expected that pollen, once in the\r\ngrip of such a wayward and shifting thing as the wind, should not be\r\nwasted in great quantities. This is particularly true of pine trees,\r\nwhich at pollen time may often be seen giving off golden clouds of dust,\r\nof which perhaps 95 per cent is wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER AS AN AID TO FERTILIZATION\r\n\r\nThose submerged aquatic plants upon which neither the winds nor\r\nhoney-seeking insects can work the magic of cross-fertilization, seem to\r\nbe about the poorest equipped for perpetuating their kind through\r\nimpregnation of their tiny flowers. And yet, for at least two of them,\r\nwhich will be described presently, the process is accomplished by an\r\nadaptation of their mode of life to their watery environment that seems\r\nincredible. These two have been selected as illustrating two peculiar\r\nadaptations in the weight of pollen or pollen-holding flowers that is\r\ncommon to some other submerged aquatic plants. In one the male flower,\r\nor pollen from it, with the very nicest adjustment of function to\r\nenvironment in all the realm of the plant world, is just of the right\r\nspecific gravity to float to the surface with dramatic suddenness and\r\nperfectly timed effectiveness. In the other the pollen is _just_ enough\r\nheavier than the water to float betwixt the surface and the bottom, so\r\nthat at the proper moment it is where it can fulfill its destiny.\r\n\r\nThe common eelgrass or tapegrass is a submerged aquatic which roots in\r\nthe mud and has long grasslike leaves which may often be seen waving\r\ngently in the current of many quiet streams in this country and in\r\nEurope. Down near the base and in among its swaying verdure, it bears\r\ntiny flowers which have no petals, and in which, as if recognizing the\r\nfutility of display in such a secluded watery home, even its calyx is\r\nreduced to small scales. Some of these minute flowers are females,\r\nothers again all males, and as they appear in their early stages it\r\nlooks as though never the twain could meet. And the hopelessness of\r\ntheir ever meeting is increased as the maturing female begins slowly to\r\nuncoil the fine stalk upon which it grows. Steadily but surely the loose\r\nspirals of the stalk of this ever more mature female flower uncoils,\r\nuntil, when quite ready for the pollen, it is at last upon the surface.\r\nThe male flowers, in the meanwhile, are down near the bottom with their\r\nsmall freight of pollen ready to perform their function, but firmly\r\nanchored to a stalk absurdly inadequate to reach the surface where alone\r\nthey can be of service. A great Belgian, Maurice Maeterlinck, who\r\nstudied this plant with more sympathetic vision than any botanist has\r\nyet been able to equal, wrote in one of his essays on “The Intelligence\r\nof Flowers” the solution of this little drama of apparent hopelessness.\r\nNo other words can ever convey the meaning of what happens to the\r\neelgrass quite so well as his. “Is there any more cruel inadvertence or\r\nordeal in nature? Picture the tragedy of that longing, the inaccessible\r\nso nearly attained, the transparent fatality, the impossible with not a\r\nvisible obstacle! It would be insoluble, like our own tragedy upon this\r\nearth, were it not that an unexpected element is mingled with it. Did\r\nthe males foresee the disillusion to which they would be subjected? One\r\nthing is certain: that they have locked up in their hearts a bubble of\r\nair, even as we lock up in our souls a thought of desperate deliverance.\r\nIt is as though they hesitated for a moment; then, with a magnificent\r\neffort, the finest, the most supernatural, that I know of in all the\r\npageantry of the insects and the flowers, in order to rise to happiness,\r\nthey deliberately break the bond that attaches them to life. They tear\r\nthemselves from their peduncle, and, with an incomparable flight * * *\r\ndart up and break the surface of the water. Wounded to death, but\r\nradiant and free, they float for a moment beside their heedless brides\r\nand the union is accomplished, whereupon the victims drift away to\r\nperish, while the wife, already a mother, closes her calyx, in which\r\nlives their last breath, rolls up her spiral, and descends to the\r\ndepths, there to ripen the fruit of the heroic kiss.”\r\n\r\nIn the eelgrass it is the specific gravity of the male flower, or, the\r\nsecreted air bubble, which makes the flower lighter than the water, and\r\nactually causes the flight from the depths to the surface. Because of\r\nthis, fertilization can only take place on the surface, although the\r\nflowers and fruits otherwise mature under water. But in sea wrack, in\r\nNaias, and in ditch grass, all submerged aquatics, the flowers are even\r\nfertilized under the water. Pollen in such plants is much modified, and\r\ninstead of being in the ordinary form of pollen grains, it is, at the\r\ntime of ripening, lengthened out into tubular, hairlike structures.\r\nThese delicate prolongations of the male fertilizing stuff are carried\r\nby the currents of the water, just as a thread would be, but with the\r\ndifference that the pollen threads are so beautifully weighted to fit\r\ntheir watery environment that they float, suspended, in the depths of\r\nthe water at or near the level of the female flowers. The pollen is set\r\nfree at maturity, just as it is in the eelgrass, but to meet the female,\r\nwhich never rises, it must float with the current of the stream. There\r\nmust, as in the wind-carried pollen, be a tremendous wastage, yet\r\nsufficient quantities of it do fertilize the females, particularly in\r\nthe ditch grass, which fruits very freely.\r\n\r\nWhether it be any of the various contrivances for insect fertilization,\r\nor by the winds, or, as in the eelgrass, by the water, the climax of the\r\nflower’s life is always reached in this act. For all annuals the plants,\r\nalso, begin to die down then, a process that is completed with the\r\nproduction of seed, which is, of course, the object of all those varied\r\nmodes of fertilization. Perhaps no answer to the question of why plants\r\ndo not always self-fertilize themselves is so eloquent as the hundreds\r\nof ways they have adopted to avoid doing so, a few of which we already\r\nknow. Many volumes have been written on this subject, but all of them,\r\nintricate as the methods they describe nearly always are, merely confirm\r\nwhat we have already seen--that rather than submit to\r\nself-fertilization, plants will adopt almost undreamed-of expedients.\r\nSometimes, as in the eelgrass and in the visits of nocturnal insects to\r\nthose night-blooming flowers that carry on their matings in the glamour\r\nof moonlight or in the dusk of eventide, the drama, in the eyes of\r\nimaginative writers, is one of singular beauty and charm. And, on the\r\nother hand, we have seen the well-nigh heartless cruelty of the\r\nDutchman’s-pipe in keeping as prisoners its absolutely necessary insect\r\ndeliverers. Even this is outranked for matchless ruthlessness by a wild\r\narum, a relative of our jack-in-the-pulpit, from the East Indies. It\r\nproduces a club-shaped inflorescence composed of tiny flowers that need\r\ncross-fertilization, but so offensive is the odor of the flower that no\r\ninsects will tolerate it. A snail, a voracious eater of foliage, is\r\nattracted to the flower partly by the fine fleshy leaves, but mostly by\r\na juice secreted at the apex of the flower column. To this the snail\r\ncrawls, and fertilizes the tiny flowers over which it drags its body.\r\nWhen this is accomplished it speeds on hungrily to the juice just above\r\nit and eagerly devours the poison. Death follows almost immediately. The\r\nsecretion of this murderous liquid to lure the only creature that will\r\nvisit such an offensively malodorous plant, which, without it, would\r\nvery likely be itself destroyed by the foliage-eating snails, is a\r\ngruesome contrast to that happy flitting of butterflies which completes\r\nthe fertilization of most flowers in equally effective but more pleasing\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nOnce impregnation of the ovule has been consummated, it begins a slow\r\nprocess of change, involving sometimes the modification of the ovary, or\r\nof the calyx, and very often of the swollen apex of the flower stalk\r\nupon which these organs are borne, known technically as the\r\n_receptacle_. We have seen, in the first chapter, what greatly different\r\ntypes of fruits are developed from different ovaries, and they of\r\ncourse produce seeds in varying size and amount. In the coco de mer, a\r\npalm from the Seychelles, the seed often weighs forty or fifty pounds,\r\nwhile in some orchids a single capsule will contain over a million\r\nalmost microscopic seeds. Some of the devices of fruits and of seeds to\r\nsecure the utmost spreading of the species over the earth will be\r\nconsidered in another chapter. All the devious methods of plants in\r\nproducing their young become significant, so far as the earth’s\r\nvegetation is concerned, only when we find out what this enormous\r\nprogeny has done with their opportunity. The chapter on the Distribution\r\nof Plants will tell us how well that opportunity has been used.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HIDDEN MARRIAGE OF FLOWERLESS PLANTS\r\n\r\nAs we stated in the first chapter _cryptogams_, while they produce no\r\nflowers, must bear organs that perform the _functions_ of flowers in the\r\nreproduction of new individuals. Because, generally speaking, the\r\nprocess is more hidden in its manifestations, and nearly always requires\r\nthe aid of the microscope to detect it, it is not so well known as the\r\nreproductive processes of flowering plants by those who have not the\r\nopportunity to manipulate such instruments. The act, however, is just as\r\ninteresting, and, as we shall presently see, it may well be considered\r\nthe ancestor of those more showy methods of producing young, which have\r\nbeen all too inadequately treated in the preceding pages. While the\r\nparts having to do with reproduction in flowerless plants are\r\nmicroscopic in size, it is possible to understand the broad outlines of\r\nwhat goes on and perhaps the life history of such plants is as well\r\nillustrated in ferns as in anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE HISTORY OF A FERN\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of ferns in the first chapter we found that on the\r\nback of some of their leaves, or occasionally on special leaves devoted\r\nto the purpose, were many small brownish or dark spots, arranged in\r\nrather definite fashion, and known as _sori_. (Figure 63.) Each sorus\r\ncontains many minute bodies known as _spores_, not unlike very miniature\r\nseeds in general appearance, but quite unlike them in behavior and mode\r\nof life. No better idea of their size can be gleaned than to record the\r\nfact that in each sorus there may be about one hundred small, often\r\nshort-stalked spore cases, known as _sporangia_, and that in each\r\nsporangium well over forty, and sometimes over sixty, spores will be\r\ncrowded. A healthy specimen of many of our common ferns will bear about\r\nten or a dozen leaves, each of which is divided into many divisions, and\r\namong these divisions of the leaf there may be at least fifty that bear\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty sori. It can be easily figured from this that a\r\nhealthy plant of this fern may and usually does produce over forty-five\r\nmillion spores, each of which contains within it the opportunity of\r\ndeveloping into a new plant. There is thus a prodigality in producing\r\nthe means of renewal of life among ferns that far outstrips the\r\nproduction of seeds in even the most prolific of flowering plants.\r\n\r\nWhen the spores in the sporangium are mature and therefore ready for the\r\nnext stage in their life history several things must happen. With\r\nsomewhere about six thousand of them crowded together under each sorus,\r\nmore room to develop is obviously the first consideration. This is\r\nprovided for by the fact that when the spores are ripe the sporangia\r\nhave the ability to throw them considerable distances; then of course\r\nthe wind can carry them much farther. To be of any use they must fall\r\nupon damp ground, for some degree of moisture is absolutely necessary\r\nfor what is about to happen to them. In nature countless millions never\r\ndo fall in a favorable location, or, if they did, such an enormous\r\nproduction of fern spores would soon make the world exclusively a fern\r\ngarden. The comparatively minute fraction of them that ever do find\r\ncongenial surroundings, once they are expelled from the spore case, then\r\nbegin a process that is not unlike the germination of a seed. For the\r\nspore must take in water from the soil, which by osmotic pressure\r\nfinally bursts it open. From the burst spore a minute tube, known as the\r\n_protonema_, or literally first thread, begins to develop. It is, of\r\ncourse, of microscopic size, and yet near its base there is a branch\r\ntube formed, differing from it in structure and ultimately forming\r\n_rhizoids_, which are rootlike hairs. Both the protonema and the\r\nrhizoids begin growing, the first forming, usually flat on the ground,\r\nan often heart-shaped body having the characteristic green coloring\r\nmatter of all plants. The rhizoids multiply and look not unlike roots.\r\nThis young, still microscopic plant, grows apace, and may soon be\r\ndistinguished with the naked eye. It looks not unlike a heart-shaped\r\nmass of greenish tissue quite flat on the ground, and is called a\r\n_thallus_.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, then, we may trace the story of any fern which has\r\nthrown off its cloud of spores and from which develops this tiny\r\nthallus, looking not in the least like a fern nor as though it could\r\never be modified into one. Because this thallus is,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--PROTHALLUS OF A FERN SEEN FROM THE UNDER SIDE\r\n\r\n(_A_^{1}) archegonia, (_A_^{2}) antheridia, and (_A_^{3}) the rhizoids.\r\n_B_: Prothallus, showing the young plant with its first leaf (_B_^{1}),\r\nits own roots (_B_^{3}) and the rhizoids of the prothallus (_B_^{2}).\r\nDrawing and legend for it slightly altered from Kraemer.]\r\n\r\nin the truest sense, merely a preparation for the process that _will_\r\nproduce another fern, it is always known as a _prothallus_. The\r\nprothallus is thus the first stage in the reproduction of ferns, a very\r\nsimple stage, with only the faintest indication that the thallus might\r\nbe considered the vegetative and its rhizoids perhaps the rootlike\r\ncounterparts of foliage and roots of mature ferns. As we shall see\r\npresently, even this differentiation has not the significance that such\r\na structure in flowering plants would indicate. There is not, as yet,\r\nthe faintest indication of sexes that need to mate in order to produce\r\ntheir young. The spore has so far only produced a tiny flat body of\r\ngreen tissues with a few rootlike threads, so unlike the fern from which\r\nit started that its true significance, or even the fact that it had\r\nought to do with ferns was not known until about the middle of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThis green cushiony prothallus keeps on growing, its heart-shaped mass\r\nbecoming divided into an obviously left and right hand side and the\r\nrhizoids multiplying in number. They are always borne on the lower side\r\nnext the ground, or next whatever the prothallus may be growing on. Near\r\nthe notch of the heart-shaped prothallus are developed a few\r\nflask-shaped bodies which contain within them an egg cell or single\r\novum, the female reproductive body. By a series of changes this egg cell\r\nbecomes embedded in a mucilaginous material. This flask-shaped body with\r\nthe female egg cell inside is known as the _archegonium_. From among the\r\nrhizoids there may, at about the same time, be found developing small\r\nglobular organs that have in them a number of tiny cells, each of which\r\nhas attached many minute threadlike tails. The globular organs, with\r\ntheir minute, tailed cells are known as _antheridia_, and comprise the\r\nmale reproductive equipment. Just as in flowering plants, neither the\r\n_archegonia_ (female) nor the _antheridia_ (male) can produce offspring\r\nwithout mating and the method by which this marriage is accomplished\r\ndiffers tremendously both in practice and in its significations from\r\nthat in phanerogams. In the first place, the male and female\r\nreproductive cells are separated by a considerable distance, they are\r\nboth inclosed in structurally different casings, and the whole operation\r\nis so microscopic that insects can be of no service. Nor can the wind do\r\nfor them what we have seen that it does for the pollen of pines and\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\nOf the aids to fertilization there remains then only the water, which\r\nplays such an important part in the mating of the eelgrass and ditch\r\ngrass among flowering plants. But in these ferns a very different drama\r\nis about to be enacted. The male cells, as we have seen, are provided\r\nwith slender tails, which are movable. They move, in fact, to such good\r\npurpose that the male cell can actually swim in the water. Of course its\r\nminute size demands only the merest drop of water, in which it will take\r\nthe only excursion of its brief life. For just as soon as it is mature,\r\na heavy dew or the tiniest particle of water will set free the little\r\nmale messengers. The water too has not been without effect on the female\r\ncell. More remarkable still, this mucilaginous matter contains in it a\r\nsubstance that acts as a lure to the swimming male cells. In any event\r\nthey do swim directly to the entrance of the female cell’s abode,\r\nthrough it and to her, when the union is effected. At once there is\r\nthrown across the entrance a membrane that excludes all other males, and\r\nthe fertilization is complete. From this union of the male and female\r\ncells a true young fern begins to develop. First a young leaf and roots,\r\nfinally a stem and in the end, of course, a full-grown fern producing\r\nspores, ready to renew the whole process.\r\n\r\nSome ferns do not follow all the steps exactly as we have outlined, for\r\nall of them have not the structure of the typical one whose life history\r\nhas been sketched above. In the adder’s-tongue fern, for instance there\r\nis a stalklike prolongation from the base of the only leaf the plant\r\nbears, on which all the spores are borne. In certain others, as in the\r\nostrich fern, the spores are borne on leaflike growths that serve only\r\nthis function. Most ferns, however, bear spores on otherwise unmodified\r\nfoliage leaves and the great bulk of them on the under side of such\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThere are several things about the life history of a fern that differ\r\nfundamentally from any flowering plant and perhaps the chief is what is\r\nknown as the alternation of generations. A spore, for instance, can\r\nnever produce a fern as a seed will always produce a flowering plant. In\r\nthis respect they are like many insects that always have two or\r\nsometimes three different stages in their life history. Only by the\r\ncomplicated method of first a spore then the prothallus, from which\r\narchegonia and antheridia are produced, followed by the free swimming\r\nmale cells fertilizing the female, can a fern reproduce itself. As we\r\nshall see in the chapter on the History of the Plant Kingdom, this\r\nalternation of generations, the absolute necessity of water in which to\r\ncarry on the fertilization, and above all the ability of the male cells\r\nfor free swimming in the water, are all landmarks in the development of\r\nplant life. In its simplest form fertilization in flowerless plants is\r\ncharacterized by one or all these processes, as it is in the ferns,\r\nwhile in the flowering plants, the act is accomplished by processes,\r\ndiscussed previously, which, in the development of the plant kingdom,\r\nmark a period only comparable, in the history of man, to such tremendous\r\nachievements as the acquirement of speech or the ability to make a fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE HISTORY OF A MOSS\r\n\r\nEver since the war, the peat-forming mosses, known as sphagnum, have\r\nbecome more widely known to the general public than any of the ten or\r\ntwelve thousand mosses known to grow on the earth. Its power of\r\nabsorption, greater than linen bandages, made it extensively used to pad\r\nsurgical dressings. Hundreds of thousands of these sphagnum\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SMALL CLOUD OF WIND-BLOWN POLLEN OF THE JAPANESE RED\r\nPINE (_Pinus densiflora_). (_Photo by C. Stuart Gager.

The people of\r\ntropical regions have more uses for this plant than there are days of\r\nthe year. Its fruits will float in the sea for months without injury and\r\nit is thought to have been distributed all over the tropical world by\r\nocean currents. Its true wild home is not certainly known, but is\r\nprobably tropical America. See chapter V for an account of the tree.\r\n(_Courtesy of Brooklyn Botanic Garden._)]\r\n\r\ndressings were made, and the collection of sphagnum from the bogs in\r\nwhich it nearly always grows was the task of many who could render no\r\nother service.\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of sphagnum is not unlike that of ferns already\r\ndescribed. There is the same necessity of a film of water in which the\r\nfree swimming male can fertilize the female. But some other things about\r\ntheir reproduction of young differ from ferns.\r\n\r\nIn the first place sphagnum is a nonvascular cryptogam, in that its\r\nleaves have no veins or ducts in them and its minute stem is also\r\nwithout those conducting passages that characterize all ferns, and the\r\nflowering plants, which are considered the most highly developed of all\r\nplant life. (See Chapter I for a discussion of this point, in the\r\nsection devoted to “Flowerless Plants.”)\r\n\r\nIn this moss, also, there are small branches, some of which bear only\r\nthe tiny leaves, but some bear leaves and the reproductive organs. The\r\nfemale or _archegonia_ are much like those in the ferns, and the\r\n_antheridia_ or male are also, as in the ferns, minute globular organs\r\nin which are the male cells. The branches bearing males are greenish,\r\nyellow, or even reddish, quite unlike the ashy gray foliage leaves which\r\ngive to sphagnum its characteristic ashy gray color. Unlike the ferns,\r\nthe male cells of sphagnum have only two tails, but they nevertheless\r\nswim, tail first, to the female, when the time for fertilization comes.\r\nThe female branches are found mostly toward the upper end of the plant\r\nand bear the archegonia at their extremities.\r\n\r\nFrom what we know of the reproductive stages in the ferns it is now\r\nobvious enough that in sphagnum moss, as we ordinarily see it, we have,\r\nbecause it bears antheridia and archegonia, a quite different condition\r\nfrom the ordinary spore-bearing leaves of ferns. For as yet spores have\r\nnot been developed on the moss. The mating of male and female cells,\r\ndirectly on the plant, proves that in this “plant,” at least, our\r\nordinary notion of this moss is mostly confined to a stage in its life\r\nhistory comparable in ferns to the production of archegonia and\r\nantheridia on the fern prothallus. From this mating of the male and\r\nfemale cells there results, as in the ferns, the production of a\r\nspore-bearing structure. This consists of a spore case, matured for the\r\nmost part in the chamber occupied by the fertilized female cell, but\r\nultimately its cap is carried upward. Later on the spore case ruptures,\r\nreleasing the spores. As in the ferns, these germinate, forming a short\r\ngreen protonema followed by a prothallus. From this a short leafy branch\r\ndevelops, which completes the life cycle, as this is the young moss\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nIn other words, sphagnum, as we ordinarily see it, produces, on the\r\nplant, male and female cells which unite to form a spore case with\r\nspores in it. These are shed, develop into a protonema which is followed\r\nby the prothallus and from this the young moss plant develops. In ferns\r\nthe conspicuous well-known stage is the spore-bearing one, in sphagnum\r\nit is the production of male and female cells directly on what appears\r\nto be the mature plant.\r\n\r\nThere are many other kinds of mosses than sphagnum, and their life\r\nhistories differ in slight degrees from it. But they all agree in this,\r\nthat the greenish, feathery little moss plant is a stage in its life\r\nhistory bearing male and female cells, the mating of which produces a\r\nspore-bearing contrivance. In most of the familiar green mosses this is\r\na capsulelike body on a short stalk, usually well elevated above the\r\ngreen mass of plants. From this the spores are shed and develop into a\r\nprotonema or “first thread” just as in ferns. Unlike them, and unlike\r\nsphagnum, the green mosses produce no thallus, and the young leaves of\r\nthe moss are developed directly from this protonema.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE HISTORY OF A MUSHROOM\r\n\r\nThe common mushroom that we eat is easily enough divided into a thick\r\nstalk, known as a _stipe_, and a broad hood called a _pileus_. The under\r\nside of the pileus is seen to be composed of thin plaits set closely\r\ntogether and radiating from the center toward the edge. These are known\r\nas _gills_. From among the gills the spores are shed when they are\r\nmature, usually foretold by the changing of the color of the gills from\r\nwhitish to purplish and even to brown or blackish. The spores are then\r\nshed and ready for the next stage. From what we already know about ferns\r\nand mosses, it is clear that from these spores a mushroom cannot develop\r\nwithout the production of male and female cells and all the rest of that\r\nprocess of hidden marriage that characterizes all flowerless plants. But\r\nin most mushrooms no one has ever seen, nor have the most carefully\r\nconducted experiments ever demonstrated the germination of the spore. So\r\nfar as we know at the present, many mushrooms may or may not produce\r\ntheir young through the germination of their spores in their native\r\nfields and meadows and the subsequent production of male and female\r\nreproductive organs. But if their spores do produce such organs, which\r\nall our knowledge of spores makes probable, it is, in a truer sense than\r\nin most cryptogams, a case of hidden marriage. The process of producing\r\ntheir young is thus a secret one that scientists have not yet been able\r\nto disclose. Of course it is a common practice of mushroom growers to\r\npurchase _spawn_ from seedsmen which under favorable conditions will\r\nproduce many young mushroom plants. This, however, is the production of\r\nyoung without mating of the sexes, a fairly common characteristic of\r\nmany other plants which will be considered presently.\r\n\r\nAs we saw in the section devoted to Flowerless Plants in Chapter I,\r\nthere are many other kinds of fungi than the familiar edible mushroom\r\nand their close relatives, the often deadly poisonous toadstools. The\r\nreproductive processes in these other fungi are fairly well understood,\r\nbut they can hardly be included here. In the mold on bread, the yeast\r\nused in baking, the rust of wheat and the diseases of other plants and\r\nof animals, the individual organism is so minute that it can only be\r\ndetected under the microscope. Their reproductive processes are, of\r\ncourse, on such a minute scale that they could be followed with profit\r\nonly by those equipped to study them. They have been described in many\r\nbotanical textbooks, and those interested in them should consult such\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nIn recapitulating the reproductive processes in cryptogamous plants the\r\nthing that distinguishes them from all flowering plants is that they\r\nbear, in some stage of their life history, a spore. From this, in the\r\ngreat bulk of them, a mature plant never develops. Only by the\r\nproduction from the spore of some contrivance for bearing male and\r\nfemale cells, which may, as in some seaweeds, even be on different\r\nplants, can a mating of these be accomplished, and from this union will\r\ndevelop the mature plant. There are many modifications of this plan, but\r\nin nearly all of them the presence of water, for the free swimming of\r\nthe male cell to its mate, is essential. Just as in flowering plants and\r\nin all the larger animals, however, the reproduction of young in\r\ncryptogams is a sexual process depending on the union of male and\r\nfemale. While in phanerogams that process may well be spoken of as\r\nvisible marriage, with all the pageantry of insects and beautifully\r\ncolored flowers, in cryptogams the process is not only a hidden\r\nmarriage, its ways are sometimes so secret that, even in the common\r\nmushroom, the actual mating is conjectured rather than demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTION OF YOUNG PLANTS WITHOUT MATING\r\n\r\nIt is so generally true in all plants that a union of male and female is\r\nnecessary for the production of young, and, as we have seen in most of\r\nthem, the process is so uniformly successful that still another mode of\r\nproducing them seems almost unnecessary. Yet in a surprisingly large\r\nnumber of plants new individuals, both of flowering and flowerless\r\nplants, are regularly produced without such a union and where sexuality\r\nhas nothing to do with the increase.\r\n\r\nIn the life plant--a thick-leaved shrub from Mexico commonly grown in\r\ngreenhouses--the leaves are wavy margined. From their edges, especially\r\nwhen injured, many tiny new plants will often start to grow. Even if the\r\nleaf is cut up into fairly small pieces many of these will develop young\r\nplants, and in various forms of the common rex begonia the leaves are\r\nusually cut into small pieces by gardeners for the production of young\r\nplants which always sprout from such pieces. It is useless to multiply\r\nsuch cases, as everyone knows of the production of young plants from the\r\nends of strawberry runners, the cutting up of potatoes, the universal\r\ngarden practice of making cuttings, and the sprouting of willows, all of\r\nwhich are effective by virtue of this faculty of plants to produce young\r\nquite without the intervention of different sexes. Not so well known are\r\nthe cases of a liverwort, a small relative of the mosses, which, if\r\nchopped into fine pieces, each will develop into a new plant. We have\r\nalready spoken of the spawn of mushrooms; and even on sphagnum moss, in\r\naddition to its sexual reproduction, it produces sterile branches that\r\nwill root and, after separation from the old plant, form a new one.\r\n\r\nWherever this tendency is found, whether it be in a microscopic seaweed,\r\nsome of which know no other means of reproduction, or in the showy\r\nbegonia, it depends for its success upon a property of the ultimate unit\r\nof its structure, the cell. Sometimes, as in bacteria or the most minute\r\nseaweeds and in some other kinds, the whole plant consists of a single\r\nmicroscopic cell, when it is said to be a _unicellular_ plant. All\r\nothers, in which the grouping or modifications of the cell makes more\r\ncomplex structures, such as trees or shrubs and all the plants that\r\ngrow, both flowering and flowerless, are called _multicellular_ plants.\r\nWhether they be of one or many cells, these have the faculty of\r\ndividing, and by this division making two where one existed before the\r\ndivision. This division of cells is what happens in the normal growth of\r\nplants and it is this division, in more unusual ways, that results in\r\nthe production of new plants without mating of the sexes. As cells are\r\nthemselves microscopic, of course their division is equally so, and\r\ncannot be described in detail here. It has been many times described and\r\npictured both in books on plants and animals, as it is the ultimate unit\r\nof the structure of both.\r\n\r\nPlant life, then, seems to be better provided with means to renew itself\r\nthan most animals, for, as we have seen, it has several methods to rely\r\non. These may be divided into sexual, which includes both that in\r\nflowering plants with their visible mating and in flowerless plants with\r\ninvisible mating, and _asexual_, literally without sex. In the latter\r\nare all those unicellular plants that reproduce themselves by simple\r\ndivision of the cell, and also those flowering plants that either\r\nnaturally, as in life plant, or by the gardener’s art of making\r\ncuttings, produce new plants quite without the intervention of the\r\nsexes. Whether it be sexual or asexual, nature has more than fulfilled\r\nits obligation to the plant world in providing it opportunities for\r\nself-renewal. No matter what apparently unfavorable condition arises and\r\noften in spite of an almost unbelievable wastage of potential life\r\nstuff, the renewal goes on, or else there is the total disappearance of\r\nthe species. So strong is this tendency to provide for renewal of their\r\nkind that many plants, if injured or cut by a mower, will almost in\r\ntheir last gasp hurriedly flower and set seeds, and we have already seen\r\nthat the little liverwort, even if cut to pieces, also obeys that nearly\r\nuniversal law of nature: “Be fruitful and multiply.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILIES OF FLOWERING PLANTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are perhaps over 150,000 different kinds of flowering plants known\r\nin the world to-day, but the flowerless ones are fewer than these in\r\nnumbers. No one really knows how many thousands of the cryptogams there\r\nmay be in the world, for all of them have not yet been described, and\r\nthere are doubtless thousands of which we merely suspect the existence.\r\nFlowering plants are so much better known, and have for 2,000 years been\r\nthe subject of scientific writings, that their relationships and obvious\r\ngroupings into families are fairly definite and often easily\r\nrecognizable.\r\n\r\nIn our ordinary discussions or gossip of neighbors or relatives, the\r\nabsolutely necessary starting point is to know their name. Their\r\nacquirement of this by christening, or by the adoption of it through the\r\nusage of parents, settles for life what they will be called. Plants are\r\nalso christened, and that ceremony is one of the most important events\r\nin our subsequent discussion of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT NAMES AND HOW THEY ARE ACQUIRED\r\n\r\nAs we always have at least two names, one to show that we are a Smith,\r\nfor instance, and another to fix us as John Smith, so all plants have\r\ntwo names, sometimes three.\r\n\r\nAnd because plants come from all over the world and are studied and\r\nloved by people of many different languages, it became necessary very\r\nearly in the descriptive writings about them to hit upon some device\r\nthat should insure the name of a particular plant being the same all\r\nover the world, whether used by a student in the Imperial University of\r\nChina, or by a garden enthusiast in Connecticut. At the time when this\r\nneed for christening plants with names that would pass current\r\nthroughout the world was getting to be a crying necessity, the language\r\nof all learned men was Latin, so it was natural that they should give\r\nLatin names to plants. That practice has continued to the present day,\r\nand there are even now some botanists that cling to the old custom of\r\ndescribing the newly christened plant in Latin. In the olden days this\r\nwas always done, so that much of our knowledge of plants has come down\r\nto us from early books written wholly in Latin. The unfamiliarity of\r\nLatin to most of us, and the terrifyingly difficult spelling of some\r\nplant names, has resulted in many people saying: “God made the flowers,\r\nbut the devil gave them names.” Nevertheless, these Latin names are the\r\nonly ones we can use without endless confusion, just as we bear the\r\nnames assigned to us by our parents, and no others.\r\n\r\nIf we were to go out into the country and pick up a wild rose which\r\nseemed to be different from any other rose, it would be necessary, in\r\norder to talk about it subsequently, to give it a name. After carefully\r\nsearching through all the books about roses and finding out that it\r\nreally is a new kind of rose rather than merely being new to us, we\r\nshould then be ready to christen our new find. As we have said, all\r\nplants bear two names. One of these is a general one, like Smith, for\r\ninstance, and the other more specific, like John. These general names of\r\nplants, and they are always their first names, are, because they fix the\r\nplant as belonging to a particular group, known as generic names. The\r\ngeneric name of violets, for instance, is _Viola_; of buttercups,\r\n_Ranunculus_; of wheat, _Triticum_; of corn, _Zea_; and of roses,\r\n_Rosa_. Our new rose then bears, without any act of ours, the generic\r\nname _Rosa_, which was applied to roses many years ago, and must\r\ntherefore be used for all subsequently discovered roses. This generic\r\nname of _Rosa_, like all other generic names, tells us that roses are a\r\nwell-recognized group of plants, all more like one another than like\r\nblackberries, for instance, and because of this they are said to all\r\nbelong to the same genus. A genus (plural, genera) is a group of\r\ndifferent plants, all more like one another than like anything else. To\r\ngo back to our new _Rosa_, we must now apply its second and more\r\nspecific name. If it were a white rose, and had never before been\r\ndescribed, we should almost certainly use for its second name something\r\nsignifying its color and assign _alba_ as the obvious Latin equivalent\r\nof white. The second name is always called the specific name, because it\r\nshows us that from all other roses our new _Rosa alba_ differs in being\r\nwhite. It is of the genus _Rosa_, but it is also and forever after a\r\nrecognized member of _Rosa_, to which a specific name has been\r\napplied--in other words, _Rosa alba_ is a species of rose. Species are\r\nthus plants more like one another than they are like any other member of\r\nthe genus to which they belong. _Rosa alba_ is a species quite unlike\r\n_Rosa lucida_, or _Rosa carolina_, or all the other scores of roses\r\nalready known or described. At the time of christening _Rosa alba_, we\r\nshould not only enter its name in a book, as ours would be in a parish\r\nregister, but do much more than that. We should so carefully describe it\r\nand, preferably, illustrate it with a picture that no one coming after\r\ncould ever mistake _Rosa alba_ for any other rose. It can be readily\r\nseen that the christening of new plants is very nearly as serious an\r\naffair as christening babies, and furthermore, it is only to be\r\nattempted by experts. Because this has not always been done, many plants\r\nhave been christened two or three times. Of course, these subsequent\r\nchristenings do not seriously matter, for plants, like ourselves, should\r\nhave only one specific name, the first applied to them. But their\r\nsubsequent christenings by the careless and ignorant have enormously\r\nincreased the difficulty of talking or writing about plants. These\r\nspurious names are common throughout the literature of botany and are\r\nknown as synonyms.\r\n\r\nThe thing to remember about plants, so far as our need for classifying\r\nthem is concerned, is that they belong to different species which might\r\nalmost be considered the unit or simplest recognizable category into\r\nwhich they may be sorted. For convenience, we sort species into genera\r\nwhich may well be considered the next highest category in which plants\r\nare grouped. The grouping of genera into tribes, of tribes into\r\nfamilies, and of families into still larger categories, has nothing to\r\ndo with their names, but everything to do with our understanding of how\r\nthey are related to one another, and what these different categories\r\nmean in the great collection of plants all about us. In other words, it\r\nreduces to a definite system an apparently hopelessly mixed-up mass of\r\nplants that, without some contrivance of the sort, would simply be a lot\r\nof totally unrelated specimens of plant life. Actually they are grouped\r\nin fairly definite categories, some of which are easily recognizable,\r\nand all of which fit into that great scheme of nature where everything\r\nmay seem chaotic, but to the observant it is really a very pattern of\r\norder. What it all means and how plants have been grouped into families\r\nwill be explained, now that we understand how they have acquired their\r\ngeneric and specific names.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT FAMILIES AND ORDERS\r\n\r\nA scientist once visiting in Bulgaria noticed that the peasants in that\r\ncountry frequently lived over a hundred years and, in trying to find out\r\nthe reason, he discovered that they drank large quantities of sour milk.\r\nThis is alive with a definite kind of bacterium that is of great benefit\r\nto the digestive apparatus, and therefore helps in the prolongation of\r\nlife. In Bulgaria, in other words, a certain food habit of the people\r\nhas resulted in a definite prolongation of life and fixes that\r\npopulation as of somewhat different characteristics from people not\r\naddicted to sour milk. In Japan a whole race lives largely on fish and\r\nrice, and while this is not the cause of their yellow skin, it is almost\r\nsurely the cause of their generally small stature. Many of the English\r\nare tall, light-haired, and blue-eyed people, fond of outdoor life and\r\nsports, and among the most highly developed of the peoples of the earth.\r\nThe climate of that island, their generally large consumption of meat\r\nand the outdoor life of so many of them, have resulted in quite definite\r\ncharacteristics that make the typical Englishman an easily\r\ndistinguishable type.\r\n\r\nIn studying man we are able not only to divide him into such broad\r\ndivisions as white, black, and yellow races, but due to their particular\r\ncountry or mode of life there are scores of racial subdivisions of these\r\nlarger categories that everyone recognizes. Such differences are often\r\nbased on stature, shape of head, mental characters and many others, but\r\nthose still finer shades of difference between, for instance, a\r\nConnecticut Yankee and a plantation owner in the South, are, while noted\r\nby everyone, very difficult to accurately describe.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to find such major differences in plants, some structural\r\ncharacter that would set off one large group of plants from every other\r\ngroup, the botanist has a harder task than the person studying man. For\r\nall those differences of language and mentality that make up such a\r\nlarge part of our common knowledge of the different peoples of the earth\r\nare characters that are foreign to plants. We are thus thrown back on\r\nstructure as the chief way in which plants differ, and because their\r\nreproductive organs are their most important ones, and therefore least\r\nlikely to vary, it is upon certain characters of these organs that all\r\nflowering plants have been divided.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on “How Plants Produce Their Young,” we found that most\r\nflowering plants have their ovules in an ovary which, after\r\nfertilization, develop into fruit and seed. But some plants, while they\r\nhave ovules, only bear them naked or between scales, never inclosed in\r\nan ovary. This is true in all pines, spruces, hemlocks, and all the host\r\nof their generally evergreen relatives. Such trees bear cones, between\r\nthe scales of which are perfectly naked ovules that develop into seeds\r\n(Figure 77) that have never been hidden in an ovary, as have the vast\r\nmajority of the seeds of other plants (Figure 53). These naked-seeded\r\nplants are known as _gymnosperms_ or literally _gymnos_, naked, and\r\n_sperma_, seed, and comprise all the cone-bearing trees in the world,\r\nthe larger part of which are always evergreen. In some past ages such\r\ntrees made up the bulk of vegetation of the earth, but at present they\r\nare much reduced in numbers. Familiar examples of these _Coniferæ_, or\r\ncone-bearing trees, are larch, spruce, fir, pine, hemlock, juniper, and\r\nyew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--THE JERSEY PINE\r\n\r\n(_Pinus virginiana_)\r\n\r\nA gymnosperm or naked-seeded plant. Note the seeds dropping from between\r\nthe scales of the cone.]\r\n\r\nMost of these are evergreen, which does not, of course, mean that they\r\nbear the same leaves always, but that only a few drop off at a time and\r\nare so constantly renewed that the tree is actually ever green.\r\n\r\nAll other flowering plants always bear their ovules in an ovary and,\r\nbecause of this fact, are called _angiosperms_, literally _angeion_, a\r\nvessel, and _sperma_, seed. These inclosed seeded plants comprise the\r\ngreat bulk of the vegetation of the earth to-day. So far as the\r\ntemperate zone is concerned, nearly all of them drop their leaves in the\r\nfall, and the trees belonging to the angiosperms are thus said to be\r\ndeciduous trees.\r\n\r\nNo better idea of the present size and importance of these two groups of\r\nplants can be gained than to state the fact that perhaps not over 500\r\ndifferent kinds of gymnosperms, all of which are trees and shrubs, are\r\nknown. All the rest of the flowering plants in the world, comprising\r\nover 150,000 different kinds of herbs, shrubs, and trees of infinite\r\nvariety, are angiosperms and therefore bear ovules in an ovary, followed\r\nby seeds in or on some sort of a fruit. It would almost seem as though\r\nthe simplest way to dispose of this great mass of plants would be to\r\nsort them into trees, shrubs, and herbs. For all of them belong to one\r\nof these types of plant growth, and the ancient students of plants, just\r\nbefore the time of Christ, actually divided all flowering plants into\r\nthese three classes. This, of course, threw the coniferous trees in with\r\nall other kinds and, as we have already seen, they differ from all other\r\nkinds in the important character of having naked ovules.\r\n\r\nHere, again, in order to get some system out of apparent chaos, we must\r\nfall back on some fundamental character. And, again, it is the product\r\nof the reproductive process in all this host of angiosperms which\r\nfurnishes the clue. In the seeds of many of them the young embryo has\r\nfolded up within it two seed leaves, while in all the rest only one. As\r\nwe saw in Chapter I, these seeds germinate either with a single seed\r\nleaf, like corn (Figure 85), or with two seed leaves, like beans (Figure\r\n81). Every one of these angiosperms belongs to one of these classes or\r\nthe other, and perhaps more extraordinary still is the fact that in\r\nthose with one seed leaf there are associated certain leaf and flower\r\ncharacters, while those with two seed leaves are always very different.\r\n\r\nIn the monocotyledons, or plants with a single seed leaf, the leaves are\r\npractically always parallel veined (Figure 83), like corn and grass, and\r\nlilies and palms, and hundreds of others. Also, they nearly always have\r\nthe parts of their flowers in threes (Figure 84). That is, they have\r\nthree sepals, petals, stamens, and often pistils, or multiples of three.\r\nThe common trillium or wake-robin, for instance, has three sepals, three\r\npetals, six stamens, and three styles. With a few exceptions, and nature\r\nseems to delight in producing a few such, all monocotyledons have this\r\nparallel-veined leaf character and flower parts in threes or multiples\r\nof three.\r\n\r\nPlants which send up two seed leaves (Figure 81), on the other hand,\r\nbear practically always netted-veined leaves (Figure 79), and the parts\r\nof their flowers are nearly always in fours or fives or multiples of\r\nthese numbers (Figure 80). The well-known wild geranium has five sepals,\r\nfive petals, ten stamens, and a five-lobed or five-celled ovary. There\r\nis some individual variation from this plan, sometimes one organ and\r\nsometimes another having more or less than the regular number. But so\r\noverwhelmingly true are these distinctions that dicotyledons, or plants\r\nwith two seed leaves, and monocotyledons,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 78-85.--PLANT FAMILIES\r\n\r\nDicotyledonous and Monocotyledonous growth habits contrasted. Figs.\r\n78-81. The trunk of a dicotyledonous tree showing division of the wood\r\ninto heartwood, sapwood, and cambium, which the removal of a piece of\r\nouter bark exposes.

Gymnosperms, or naked seeded plants, include all cone-bearing plants,\r\nmostly evergreen and always trees or shrubs. The pine is a familiar\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n2. Angiosperms, or inclosed seeded plants, include all other flowering\r\nplants of whatever kind. Divided into: (_a_) Monocotyledons. Sprouting\r\nwith one seed leaf, and leaves practically always parallel-veined. Parts\r\nof the flower in threes or multiples of three. Familiar examples are\r\ncorn, grass, sugar-cane, palms, cannas, and lily of the valley (Figures\r\n82-85). (_b_) Dicotyledons. Sprouting with two seed leaves, and the\r\nleaves practically always netted-veined. Parts of the flower in fours or\r\nfives or multiples of these numbers. Includes all the remaining\r\nflowering plants and is a larger group than the monocotyledons and the\r\ncone-bearing plants combined (Figures 78-81).\r\n\r\nNo matter from what part of the world a totally unfamiliar plant may\r\ncome, it is always possible to decide into which one of these groups it\r\nbelongs. That in itself tells us a good deal about its ancestors and its\r\nfuture, “places” it, in fact, in one of those major groups into which\r\nall plants are divided. No other characters that plants possess are so\r\nimportant in determining their true position in the scale of plant life\r\nas those we have briefly outlined. But merely to sort plants into these\r\nlarge groups does not tell us all we need to know about them. For all\r\nplants not only belong to monocotyledons, or dicotyledons, or\r\ngymnosperms, but also to smaller divisions of these groups. Just as\r\nwhite men are divided into Englishmen, Frenchmen, etc., so there is the\r\ngreatest necessity of dividing our large plant groups into smaller and\r\nmore precise categories.\r\n\r\nSome of the chief subdivisions of these large groups have been decided\r\nupon the fact that a considerable number of plants in them have some\r\ncharacter in common, not found in the remaining plants of the group.\r\nAmong the monocotyledons, for instance, there is a large class of plants\r\nthat have tiny flowers between dry, chaffy scales, bear no true petals\r\nor sepals, all wind pollinated and are all commonly, though incorrectly,\r\ncalled grasses. These include, strictly speaking, two groups; one, the\r\ntrue grasses in which the stem is mostly hollow and the fruit a grain,\r\nwhile the other, with solid stems and bearing achenes for fruits, are\r\nthe sedges. The grasses form one family and the sedges another, but\r\nwhile they differ in the characters just mentioned they agree in having\r\nflowers of the same general type. Families of plants are thus groups of\r\ngenera, placed together in the scheme of classification, because they\r\nare more like one another than like any other such group. Among the\r\ngrasses, for instance, are corn, wheat, rice, bamboo, orchard grass,\r\nKentucky blue grass, sugar cane, and hundreds of others, all belonging\r\nto different genera, but all those genera grouped into a single family\r\nbecause of their generally similar flowers. Just as the Kentucky blue\r\ngrass has a generic name (_Poa_) and a specific one (_pratensis_), the\r\nfamilies of plants must also bear names, usually derived from the\r\ngeneric name of one of the chief genera in it. Because _Poa_ is a large\r\nand important genus of the grasses, the family is named after it, with\r\nthe addition of _ceæ_. _Poaceæ_ is thus the family name of all the\r\ngrasses. Among the sedges one of the commonest genera is _Cyperus_,\r\nincluding many species of the galingale or earth almond. From this genus\r\nthe sedge family has been named _Cyperaceæ_ (Figure 87). So the rose\r\nfamily is the _Rosaceæ_, the violet family is _Violaceæ_, and so on\r\nthrough all the three hundred or more families which contain all the\r\nflowering plants so far discovered. Going back for a moment to the\r\n_Poaceæ_ and _Cyperaceæ_, the fact that these two large families are\r\ndifferent from each other, but have some characters in common, fixes\r\nthem as both belonging to one _order_. Orders are thus groups of one or\r\nmore plant families, all differing one from another, but obviously\r\nrelated and having some characters in common. The order containing the\r\ngrasses and sedges is named for one of the families in it with the\r\nending _ales_. Thus _Poales_ include _Poaceæ_ and _Cyperaceæ_. _Rosales_\r\ninclude _Rosaceæ_ and several families.\r\n\r\nIn other words, individual plants are grouped in species, species into\r\ngenera, genera into families, and families into orders. These orders are\r\nthemselves grouped into still larger divisions; there are, for instance,\r\ntwelve orders comprising all the monocotyledons, and about twenty orders\r\ncomprising all the dicotyledons. Once we have decided that any plant is\r\na monocotyledon or a dicotyledon, our next step should be as to which\r\norder it belongs, then its family, its genus, and finally its species.\r\nNeedless to say, such studies are necessarily of a technical nature, and\r\nwhile the details of them lie outside the scope of this book, the\r\ngeneral plan or scheme of flowering plant classification is as we have\r\noutlined it above.\r\n\r\nThis scheme of plant classification has been developed not only for our\r\nconvenience in sorting plants into definite categories, but more\r\nimportant still to show, if possible, the relationships, and\r\nparticularly the development from the simplest to the most complex types\r\nof plant life. Thus the monocotyledons begin with the cat-tails, which\r\nhave mere bristles for calyx and corolla, and lead by infinite\r\ngradations to the showy and highly complex orchids, which are considered\r\nthe climax of the monocotyledonous families. While no general account of\r\nthe plant families can be attempted here, some of the more interesting\r\nin both the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous groups will be briefly\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANT FAMILIES\r\n\r\nOf the simple plants of this group the Grass Family, or _Poaceæ_ (Figure\r\n86), is the most important, for in it are all our turf grasses, the\r\nbamboo and sugar cane, besides scores of others. Over 4,500 species are\r\nknown, and they inhabit every region of the globe. The steppes of Russia\r\nand our Great Plains are predominately grassy; in the wonderful bamboo\r\nforests in the tropics are also woody representatives of this family.\r\nCertain kinds in the tropics grow as vines, with great hooked spines at\r\nthe joints, so that nearly every kind of growth-form is to be found in\r\nthe _Poaceæ_. All agree in having very small flowers, arranged in tiny\r\nspikelets, which are themselves grouped in various ways, although the\r\ninflorescence is usually some form of spike, or raceme or panicle. The\r\nindividual flowers are between chaffy scales, of which several make up\r\neach spike. Always the lowest two scales are empty, and the flowers\r\nbegin in the third from the bottom, or\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--BLUE-JOINT GRASS\r\n\r\n(_Calamagrostis canadensis_)\r\n\r\nFIG. 87.--WOOL GRASS\r\n\r\n(_Scirpus Cyperinus_)\r\n\r\nFig. 86. Blue-joint grass, a common grass of North America and a member\r\nof the _Poaceæ_. Fig. 87. Wool-grass, a tall swamp sedge popularly but\r\nincorrectly spoken of as grass. It is a member of the _Cyperaceæ_ or\r\nSedge family, which have usually triangular solid stems, whereas grasses\r\nhave hollow round stems.]\r\n\r\nsometimes even above that. The flower is so simple that there is neither\r\ncalyx nor corolla, only three stamens and one to three styles. The fruit\r\nis a grain and the Poaceæ, therefore, are the chief source of cereals.\r\nWheat, rice, corn, oats, barley, millet, and rye, all come from grasses,\r\nand all, except corn, are natives of the Old World. They were grown for\r\ncountless ages before the discovery of America, when Europeans first saw\r\ncorn used by the Indians. As they are wind-pollinated, the flowers of\r\ngrasses produce no honey nor colored petals, and the vast majority of\r\nthem have no odor. Most of them reproduce, not only by seeds, but by\r\nrootstocks, and many of them grow so closely together that they form\r\nturf. In nearly all of them the stem is hollow, and in the largest of\r\nthem, the bamboo, these hollow stems are used as water and sewer pipes,\r\nespecially in India. An exception to the hollow stem is the sugar cane,\r\nfrom whose solid stem the juice is pressed out, that is the chief source\r\nof sugar; and our common Indian corn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--SHOWY WAKE-ROBIN\r\n\r\n(_Trillium grandiflorum_)\r\n\r\nA plant of the lily family (_Liliaceæ_). Note the tendency to net-veined\r\nleaves in a monocotyledonous plant. Such instances are common in nature\r\nand net-veined leaves are found in certain species of smilax and most of\r\nthe plants of the Arum family, containing the jack-in-the-pulpit, both\r\nmonocotyledons.]\r\n\r\nMuch more highly developed than the grasses is the lily family or\r\n_Liliaceæ_ (Figure 88), but comprising less than 1,500 species in about\r\n125 genera. They are nearly always herbs, but the Spanish bayonet forms\r\na woody trunk, while the dragon tree of the Canary Islands is an\r\nextraordinary plant for a lily relative, one giant specimen of this\r\nbeing 80 feet tall and over 45 feet in circumference.[1] The flowers in\r\nthe _Liliaceæ_ are nearly always perfect, that is, stamens and pistils\r\nare found in the same flower. Its perianth segments are nearly always\r\nsix, sometimes distinguishable as petals and sepals, but more often, as\r\nin the tulip, all colored similarly. The fruits are practically always a\r\ncapsule that splits lengthwise. Perhaps the different plants in the\r\n_Liliaceæ_, as well as any others, illustrate the fact that plants of\r\nany particular family need not look like one another in order to be\r\nincluded in the same family. Nothing could be farther from resemblance\r\nthan the bulb-bearing onion, the tulip, the Easter lily, the Spanish\r\nbayonet, and the dragon tree. Yet they and hundreds of other plants\r\nbelong to the _Liliaceæ_. It cannot be overemphasized that it is flower\r\nand fruit characters that determine inclusion in any plant family, and\r\nsimilarity of leaves or habit may or may not accompany such characters.\r\nAmong other well-known plants in the family, which is found throughout\r\nthe world, are the crocus, the day lily, the dogtooth violet, hyacinth,\r\nand colchicum and aloes used in medicine. Many of them produce bulbs,\r\nsuch as onion, tulip, and lily and some of these contain valuable foods\r\nand drugs. The great majority of them are insect fertilized and are\r\ntherefore wonderfully colored, and some furnish rich stores of honey.\r\n\r\nBut the most highly developed and interesting of all the\r\nmonocotyledonous plants are the orchids (Figures 89-92). This family,\r\n_Orchidaceæ_,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--ROSE POGONIA\r\n\r\n(_Pogonia ophioglossoides_)\r\n\r\nFIG. 90.--YELLOW-FRINGED ORCHID\r\n\r\n(_Blephariglottis ciliaris_)\r\n\r\nFig. 89. Rose pogonia. A native bog orchid with purplish-pink flowers.\r\nFig. 90. Yellow-fringed orchid. A bog and meadow orchid of the eastern\r\nUnited States.]\r\n\r\ncomprises over 6,000 species and many varieties, the overwhelming\r\nproportion of which live in the tropics. Perhaps 90 per cent of them are\r\nepiphytes, or air plants, which are perched high up on the branches or\r\nbark of trees, and take all their food and water from the air. All the\r\nnative orchids of temperate North America grow in the ground, however,\r\nand their food habits are unique. They depend for food upon a\r\nmicroscopic organism found inside the roots of all orchids, and which\r\nhelps them to take in the food from the soil. So many of these orchids\r\nare partial saprophytes, and without the associated organism they could\r\nnot grow. Almost uniformly the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--WHORLED POGONIA\r\n\r\n(_Isotria verticillata_)\r\n\r\nFIG. 92.--ARETHUSA\r\n\r\n(_Arethusa bulbosa_)\r\n\r\nFig. 91. Whorled pogonia.

The most beautiful\r\nof our bog orchids, with a fringed lip and pinkish-purple flowers which\r\nbloom about Decoration Day. Note the highly irregular flowers in this\r\nand Figs. 89-91.]\r\n\r\n_Orchidaceæ_ have only a very few sheathing leaves, entirely without\r\nmarginal teeth, and some kinds are practically leafless. The flowers,\r\namong the most gorgeous in the world, are always irregular in the sense\r\nthat there is no obvious series of sepals and petals. Both these are so\r\nmuch transformed as to be nearly unrecognizable as such, but in some\r\norchids there appear to be three sepals. More often of the three inner\r\nsegments of the flower two are somewhat alike, while the third is quite\r\nunlike them and is known as the lip; it is among the most variable of\r\nany parts of the orchid flower. As adapted to insect visitors, the\r\nflowers of orchids are the most wonderfully developed of all plants.\r\nBecause of their beauty and strange shapes, orchids have been much\r\nsought after by collectors, and explorations of tropical, fever-ridden\r\nforests have not infrequently ended in death to orchid hunters. New and\r\nrare species of them are constantly being gathered by these collectors.\r\nOne expedition to New Guinea found over 1,000 kinds never before known,\r\nand in the last few decades over 4,000 new orchids have been discovered.\r\nFor these plants orchid fanciers pay large sums, and a single plant of a\r\nrare one sold in London at auction for over $500. The chances of\r\ncollecting such species made expeditions to the tropics frequent during\r\nthe latter half of the last century.\r\n\r\nThese three families, Poaceæ, Liliaceæ, and Orchidaceæ, are perhaps the\r\nmost important of all the monocotyledons, although commercially the\r\npalms, or Palmaceæ, are extensively used. It is impossible to describe\r\nor even mention all the monocotyledonous families, but a list of the\r\nmore important is added. The families are arranged in the order that\r\nseems to reflect the development from simpler ones to the most complex,\r\nand is the sequence of such families used by nearly all botanists in\r\ndescribing the plant families of the world:\r\n\r\n_Typhaceæ_--The cat-tails. Tall, reedlike swamp plants found throughout\r\nthe world. One genus and about ten species.\r\n\r\n_Pandanaceæ_--The screw pines. Shrubs or trees with stout, woody trunks\r\nand mostly prickly margined, long sword-shaped leaves. Confined to the\r\nOld World tropics.\r\n\r\n_Poaceæ_--The grasses. Noted above.\r\n\r\n_Cyperaceæ_--The sedges. Grasslike plants with solid, often triangular\r\nstems. Very often inhabitants of wet places. Throughout the world, Crex\r\nrugs are made from a species of Carex, the largest genus in the family.\r\nAbout 75 genera and 3,200 species.\r\n\r\n_Palmaceæ_--The palms. All trees or shrubs, or sometimes climbing vines.\r\nIncludes the coconut and palm-oil trees, two palms of tremendous\r\neconomic importance. Inhabitants of tropical and warm regions, and only\r\nvery few found in the United States. Over 130 genera and 1,200 species.\r\n\r\n_Araceæ_--The arums, of which the jack-in-the-pulpit is our best-known\r\nnative representative. They are nearly always herbs, often of giant\r\nsize, and the great majority are found in the tropical regions. Flowers\r\nvery minute, crowded together on a central column (the spadix), and this\r\noften surrounded or having at its base a leaflike appendage (the\r\nspathe). Calamus root and the skunk cabbage are also native\r\nrepresentatives. About 105 genera and over 900 species.\r\n\r\n_Liliaceæ_--The lily and related plants, noted above.\r\n\r\n_Smilaceæ_--Smilax. Mostly prickly vines; our native kinds often called\r\ncat briers. Sarsaparilla comes from at least four species of _Smilax_.\r\nThree genera and about 300 species, mostly natives of tropical, but a\r\nfew of temperate regions.\r\n\r\n_Amaryllidaceæ_--The amaryllis family, noted chiefly for the sisal fiber\r\nthat comes from a species of _Agave_, which is one of the many different\r\nkinds of century plant. The family has usually capsular fruits and black\r\nseeds, and the narcissus and amaryllis of our gardens are well-known\r\nmembers. About 70 genera and 800 species from tropical and warm\r\ncountries; a few in temperate regions, mostly herbs.\r\n\r\n_Iridaceæ_--The iris, the source of orris root, and containing some our\r\nmost beautiful garden plants, the blue-eyed grass of fields, and over 50\r\ngenera and 100 species are found in this family. Nearly throughout the\r\nworld, and nearly all herbs.\r\n\r\n_Musaceæ_--The banana and traveler’s-tree. Giant herbs, in the banana\r\nhaving the largest leaves known, frequently twelve feet long and two\r\nwide. Natives of tropical and warm regions, and 4 genera and 75 species\r\nare known. Flowers often very irregular, and in _Strelitzia_ gorgeous.\r\n\r\n_Orchidaceæ_--The orchids, already noted.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many thousands of plants contained in these\r\nmonocotyledonous families and in the others not mentioned here, they\r\nmake up only about one-third of the total number of different kinds of\r\nplants known in the world. But in grasses and sedges, in the rushes and\r\na few other families, the number of individuals is greater than in\r\nprobably any other plant family.\r\n\r\n\r\nDICOTYLEDONOUS PLANT FAMILIES\r\n\r\nAll the great bulk of the flowering plants not included in the\r\nmonocotyledons or the gymnosperms belong to about two hundred plant\r\nfamilies that are included in the dicotyledons. In all of them the seed\r\nsends up two seed leaves, there are generally netted-veined leaves and\r\nthe parts of the flower are in fours or fives or multiples of these\r\nnumbers. In such a large aggregation of plant families there are three\r\nwell-marked divisions, namely, those that bear no petals or sepals,\r\nthose that do bear them and where they are separated to form individual\r\nsepals or petals, and those where the petals are united to form some\r\nsort of a tubular or at least connected corolla. These divisions are\r\nperhaps best shown thus:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Apetalæ_--Including families where the petals are never present,\r\nand in some there is even no calyx. Examples: walnut, hickory, willow,\r\nand oaks.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Polypetalæ_--Petals present but separate, not forming a tubular\r\nor connected corolla. Examples: buttercup, rose, pea, apple, geranium.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Gamopetalæ_--Petals united and forming some sort of a tubular or\r\nconnected corolla. Examples: garden primrose, gentian, salvia, mint,\r\nsnapdragon, and the daisy family.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to describe the families contained in these three divisions\r\nof the dicotyledons would take all the rest of this book and crowd out\r\nother things about plant life that must not be omitted. All that can be\r\ndone here is to outline briefly a few families in each division so that\r\nwe shall have fixed in our minds what the general principles of plant\r\nclassification are and how these are illustrated by well-known plants.\r\nThere are many books that deal with this subject in great detail and to\r\nthem the student should go for further elaboration of the subject. It is\r\none of the most interesting phases of the study of botany, but it\r\ndemands a longer and more intensive study than can be included here.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Apetalæ_--These include families of plants that are the simplest\r\nin structure of all the dicotyledons. In all of them there are no petals\r\nand in some both petals and sepals are lacking, leaving only essential\r\norgans. Taking first those families that have neither petals nor sepals\r\nwe find that most of them bear their flowers in catkins, a flower\r\ncluster familiar enough in the pussy willow. Some of these families are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n_Juglandaceæ_--Trees with compound leaves, flowers in catkins and fruits\r\ninclosed in a thick husk. Examples: walnut and hickory. Six genera and\r\nover 30 species.\r\n\r\n_Salicaceæ_--Shrubs or trees with simple leaves, flowers in catkins and\r\ncapsular many-seeded fruits, but no nuts. Containing only willows and\r\npoplars. Two genera and over 200 species. (Figure 93.)\r\n\r\n_Myricaceæ_--Shrubs or trees with simple usually fragrant leaves,\r\nflowers in catkins and fruits one-seeded. The bayberries. Two genera and\r\nabout 35 species. (Figure 94.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--PRAIRIE WILLOW\r\n\r\n(_Salix humilis_)\r\n\r\nThe _Salicaceæ_, consisting only of willows and poplars, are always\r\nwoody plants bearing their flowers in catkins.]\r\n\r\nThese and some other families of close relationship are the least\r\ndeveloped, in their flower structure, of any of the dicotyledons. All of\r\nthem bear only the essential organs of reproduction in their very simple\r\nflowers. In the walnuts and hickories the different sexes are in\r\ndifferent flowers on the same plant, in the willows they are even on\r\ndifferent plants, and in Myricaceæ they are often found both ways. All\r\nof these flowers are wind-pollinated, so that they bear no honey,\r\nusually have no odor, and of course their need for showy petals for\r\nattracting insects is nil, although some pollen-eating insects visit\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--SWEET FERN\r\n\r\n(_Comptonia peregrina_) belonging to the _Myricaceæ_.\r\n\r\nThese are usually aromatic, always woody plants, of which several\r\nspecies besides sweet fern grow in the United States.]\r\n\r\nSomewhat higher in the scale of plant life are those families that,\r\nwhile still lacking petals, do have sepals. Their flowers are for this\r\nreason much better protected against rain or other inclement conditions,\r\nwhich means that they are so much the more likely to reproduce their\r\nkind. At least two of these slightly more developed families cling to\r\nthe habit of bearing some of their flowers in catkins, however. Other\r\nfamilies are also found in other parts of the world, but in North\r\nAmerica this group is represented by:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSPLANTING RICE IN JAVA\r\n\r\n(_Courtesy of Brooklyn Botanic Garden._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TEA ESTATE IN CEYLON\r\n\r\n(_Courtesy of Brooklyn Botanic Garden._)]\r\n\r\n_Betulaceæ_--The birch, alder, hazelnut, and hornbeam. Both staminate\r\nand pistillate flowers in catkins. Fruit a small one-seeded nut or a\r\nwinged samara in the birch. All wind-pollinated. Six genera and about\r\nseventy-five species, nearly all from north temperate zone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--LOW BIRCH\r\n\r\n(_Betula pumila_)\r\n\r\nA bog shrub of the _Betulaceæ_ or birch family. Most of them are tall\r\ntrees with both male and female flowers in catkins.]\r\n\r\n_Fagaceæ_--The oaks, beech, and chestnut. All trees or shrubs with at\r\nleast their staminate flowers in catkins. Fruit inclosed in a bur\r\n(chestnut and beech) or borne in a cup (the acorns of oaks). At least\r\nfive genera and about 375 species, widely distributed.\r\n\r\nThe habit of bearing some or all their flowers in catkins which flower\r\nusually before the leaves appear, and of having such flowers wholly at\r\nthe mercy of precarious winds, is, if not lost, at least much less\r\nfrequent in the remaining families of the apetalæ. All the others, while\r\nstill without petals, do have sepals and some of these are colored so\r\nthat insect visitors are likely. There are too many of these families to\r\nbe enumerated here, but two of the chief are:\r\n\r\n_Ulmaceæ_--The elms and hackberry. Trees or shrubs with minute greenish\r\nor yellowish flowers crowded in small clusters or in spikes. Fruit a dry\r\nnut or one-seeded and winged; or in the hackberry a drupe, one of the\r\nfirst evidences of even a slightly fleshy fruit in the dicotyledons.\r\nAbout 13 genera and 140 species, widely distributed.\r\n\r\n_Polygonaceæ_--The buckwheat, knotweeds, common dock, and many other\r\ngenera. Sepals often colored white or pink so the flowers are sometimes\r\nat least insect-pollinated. Flowers small and crowded in various\r\nclusters, often in a spike. Fruit an achene, a dry fruit familiar enough\r\nin the buckwheat. About 40 genera and over 800 species, mostly herbs or\r\nvines here, but often trees in the tropics.\r\n\r\nFrom here on plant families leave, with some exceptions, the greenish or\r\notherwise inconspicuous flower color, and somewhere about here they\r\nbegin to rely more upon insect fertilization for the perpetuation of\r\ntheir kind. None of those so far mentioned have any petals to their\r\nflowers, but in the pink family or Caryophyllaceæ we find the first\r\nevidences on any considerable scale of the presence of sepals and\r\npetals, the latter usually beautifully colored. Familiar representatives\r\nof this family are the pink, carnation, chickweed, corn cockle, and the\r\nstichwort. There are over 50 genera and 1,000 species, nearly all in\r\ntemperate regions.\r\n\r\nThe apetalous families appear to show a development from catkin-bearing\r\ntrees with the sexes separated, and with neither petals nor sepals,\r\nthrough the Polygonaceæ, with often colored sepals, and the beginnings\r\nof insect fertilization. In Caryophyllaceæ, the most highly developed of\r\nthem all, there are, besides the sepals, often or usually petals, and\r\nthe reliance on insect fertilization is nearly complete. There are many\r\ntransitional stages which cannot be included here, but they show step by\r\nstep the development of the apetalous families from perfectly naked\r\nreproductive organs to the next larger group, the polypetalæ, where the\r\nprocess of increasingly complex flower development will now be sketched.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Polypetalæ_--In this large group of plant families the petals are\r\nfree and quite separate, but as if they had not yet lost all the\r\ncharacters of the apetalæ, some families show incompletely the general\r\ncharacteristics of their more stable neighbors. There are, for instance,\r\nno petals in many species of the buttercup family, none in the sweet-gum\r\ntree nor in the maples, and a few others. But in spite of occasional\r\nexceptions this large group of polypetalous families do usually bear\r\nseparate petals and sepals, and are among the most important of all the\r\nplant families. As they number over a hundred and contain thousands of\r\nspecies, all that can be done here is to mention a few typical or\r\nimportant ones. Just as in the apetalæ the families in this large group\r\nappear to show definite stages in development from simpler to more\r\ncomplex forms. But the steps are harder to trace and what appears\r\nsimple characters in some plants are very complex in others.\r\n\r\nWhile all the families in this group have separate petals some of them\r\nshow a tendency to have united sepals, a character of perhaps some\r\nadvantage and certainly very common among the still more developed\r\ngamopetalæ. Some of the families that have separate sepals agree in\r\nhaving the stamens inserted below the ovary. Of these the following\r\nthree families may serve as types.\r\n\r\n_Nymphæaceæ_--The water lilies. Aquatic plants with usually large showy\r\nflowers in which the calyx, corolla, and stamens often merge one into\r\nthe other so that it is sometimes difficult to know where one series\r\nends and the other begins. Five genera and 45 species throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n_Ranunculaceæ_--Buttercup family. Includes buttercups, clematis,\r\ncolumbine, meadow rue, golden seal, marsh-marigold, hepatica, and scores\r\nof other native plants. All herbs, except a few semiwoody vines like\r\nclematis. Sepals always present, and where no petals are found, as in\r\nmarsh-marigold, colored like them. Highly irregular flowers are not\r\nuncommon, as in columbine and monkshood. The fruits are berrylike in\r\nsome genera and in others dry capsules. Thirty-five genera and over\r\n1,000 species throughout the world, but most abundant in temperate\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n_Lauraceæ_--Laurel or sassafras family. Includes besides them the guava\r\nand cinnamon and camphor trees, all tropical, and the native spice-bush.\r\nAll trees and shrubs with small, yellow, or greenish-yellow flowers and\r\nusually aromatic juice. Fruit a one-seeded drupe or a berry. About 40\r\ngenera and over 1,000 species, nearly all tropical, but a few in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nAt this point, in the sequence of plant families, there are two or three\r\nfamilies that bear quite different fruits than any heretofore noted, and\r\nin one of them, at any rate, the four petals are in the form of a cross.\r\nSo uniformly is this true that the family was for years known as the\r\nCruciferæ, but is better known as Brassicaceæ, from _Brassica_, the\r\ngeneric name of the mustard. This large mustard family mostly has fruits\r\nknown as a silique or silicle, which are pods that split into two\r\nvalves; and yellow or white, rarely pinkish flowers. The juice is always\r\nsomewhat acrid, familiar through the pleasant pungent taste of\r\nwater-cress, but none of the family is poisonous. There are over 200\r\ngenera and nearly 2,000 species of wide distribution, and common\r\nrepresentatives include the cress, mustard, horse-radish, garden stock,\r\nsweet alyssum, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, radish, and\r\nturnip.\r\n\r\nBetween the Brassicaceæ and the following families there are many others\r\nthat cannot be mentioned here. Somewhat farther along in the sequence\r\nare a group of families, large and important, and all having their\r\nstamens inserted around or even above the ovary, and in which the sepals\r\nare partly or wholly united. They include some of our most beautiful\r\nflowers and useful fruits. Of the many closely related families that\r\nagree in these characters the two most important are:\r\n\r\n_Rosaceæ_--Rose family. In the broad sense including, besides the rose,\r\nthe strawberry, blackberry, apple, pear, peach, plum, besides many herbs\r\nwith wholly dry fruits. There are always five petals, five lobes to the\r\npartly united calyx, but numerous stamens. They may be herbs, shrubs,\r\nor trees, with simple or compound leaves, but these are nearly always\r\nalternately arranged. There are over 100 genera and nearly 2,000\r\nspecies. Because of the size of the Rosaceæ and differences in fruit,\r\nthe apple and its relatives are often included in a separate family, the\r\nMalaceæ (Figure 96), and the peaches and plums in Amygdalaceæ. The\r\ngeneral structure of the flower is sufficiently uniform, however, for\r\nthem all to have been included in Rosaceæ (Figure 97).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--WASHINGTON THORN\r\n\r\nA prickly shrub related to the apple, which, with the plums, cherries,\r\npears, strawberry, blackberry and hundreds of other plants are all\r\ngrouped in the _Rosaceæ_ or rose family.]\r\n\r\n_Papilionaceæ_--Pea family. A large family having characteristic pealike\r\nflowers, a description of which has already been given in Chapter I.\r\nThey all bear legumes, a pod that splits down one side, not both, as in\r\nBrassicaceæ. Besides the pea, the bean, vetch, alfalfa, lentil, locust\r\ntree, and dozens of valuable timber trees in the tropics belong here.\r\nFlowers all showy and absolutely dependent upon insects for\r\nfertilization. Seeds highly nutritious in many genera, and the roots of\r\nnearly all have bacteria associated with them. (See chapter on Food\r\nHabits of Plants.) Three hundred and twenty-five genera and over 5,000\r\nspecies of wide distribution, but most frequent in the tropics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--THIMBLEBERRY\r\n\r\n(_Rubus odoratus_)\r\n\r\nA bristly shrub of the Rose family common in rocky places in eastern\r\nNorth America.]\r\n\r\nThere are many other smaller families in different parts of the world\r\nwhich hover, as it were, about these two giant plant families that make\r\ndefinite landmarks in the scheme of plant classification. The character\r\nof having partly united sepals and numerous stamens inserted around, or\r\neven above the ovary, give to all the flowers of the Rosaceæ and related\r\nplants a general family resemblance that is very striking. The pea\r\nfamily, and its relatives, also have flower and fruit characters of\r\nremarkable uniformity, considering the tremendous number of species.\r\n\r\nFrom this point on to the end of the polypetalæ there are scores of\r\nplant families, all agreeing in having a compound ovary, that is, one\r\nthat is more than one-celled, and in also having quite distinct and\r\nseparate sepals. Their agreement in these characters, however, ends all\r\nother evidences of relationship, and it is beyond the scope of this book\r\nto go into the details of each, or even a few of them. A list with some\r\nbrief notes on those most important must suffice here.\r\n\r\n_Geraniaceæ_--Geranium family. Includes also the common garden as well\r\nas the wild geranium. Fruit splitting into five parts. Leaves always\r\ndivided or even dissected; 12 genera and 470 species, all herbs.\r\n\r\n_Anacardiaceæ_--Includes the tree of heaven, sumac, poison ivy, and in\r\nthe tropics, the mahogany, all trees, shrubs, or vines; 60 genera and\r\n500 species, mostly in the tropics.\r\n\r\n_Malvaceæ_--Mallow family, including, besides the marshmallow, the rose\r\nof Sharon, and cotton. They all have the stamens united into a column or\r\ntube which surrounds the style. About 40 genera and 900 species of\r\nherbs, shrubs, or trees of wide distribution.\r\n\r\n_Cactaceæ_--Cactus family. Nearly all desert plants, with no leaves or\r\npractically none, and greenish stems that function as leaves and also\r\nstore water. Of the greatest variety of form and always bearing numerous\r\npetals and fleshy fruits, of which the prickly pear is familiar enough.\r\nOf 40 genera and over 1,000 species, all, but a handful, come from North\r\nand South America.\r\n\r\n_Umbelliferæ_ (often called _Ammiaceæ_)--The climax of the polypetalous\r\nfamilies, and nearly always bearing flowers in umbels. There are usually\r\nmany flowers, sometimes several hundred in each cluster. Familiar\r\nexamples are parsley, celery, parsnip, Queen Anne’s lace, and many\r\nothers. The seeds often contain an aromatic oil, as in caraway, and some\r\nare violently poisonous, as the water hemlock. About 250 genera and over\r\n2,000 species, all herbs, widely distributed, but most common in\r\ntemperate regions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen from the foregoing the probable development of\r\ndicotyledonous plants from those simplest ones, where, as in the pines,\r\nthere is merely a naked ovule between scales, through the catkin-bearing\r\ntrees, without petals or sepals, and all wind-pollinated, to families\r\nwhere just an inconspicuous and, subsequently, a colored calyx is found,\r\nand after this the dawn of those plants that have complete and perfect\r\nflowers. Among the latter all those so far noted have separate petals,\r\nbut after the Ammiaceæ, or carrot family, there appears a new character,\r\nsetting off practically all other dicotyledonous plants from those\r\nalready treated. This new character--and hints of it are found before it\r\nreaches the perfection found in the subsequently described families--is\r\nthat of the petals being united to form some sort of a connected or,\r\nmore often, a tubular corolla. The petals are represented merely by the\r\nlobes of the corolla, mostly four or five, and in many families of this\r\ngroup, known as the gamopetalæ, literally, united petals, this tubular\r\ncorolla is irregular and often beautifully formed. In salvia, for\r\ninstance, there is a hoodlike upper part overhanging the lower tubular\r\npart. Other familiar examples of these irregular corollas are the garden\r\nsnapdragon, Oswego tea, skullcap, pentstemon, and many others.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Gamopetalæ_--The earlier families among those generally having\r\nunited petals seem not yet quite sure of their new character, for a few\r\nof them hark back to the condition of having, in some genera, quite\r\nseparate petals. One of the first families in this series, the Ericaceæ\r\n(Figure 98), or heath family, has several genera in which this is true,\r\nnotably in the Labrador tea and the sand myrtle among native plants, and\r\nsome foreign relatives. The Ericaceæ are almost exclusively shrubs or\r\ntrees, but some of our native sorts, such as trailing arbutus and\r\nwintergreen, are practically herblike, although they are, strictly\r\nspeaking, woody plants. The family is remarkable for containing\r\nbeautiful flowered garden plants, such as the hundreds of species of\r\nSouth African heaths, the heather, the azaleas and rhododendrons, and\r\nour beautiful native Rhodora, about which Emerson wrote one of his most\r\nbeautiful poems. The flowers in the heath family are often perfectly\r\nregular and bell-shaped, but sometimes irregular, as in azaleas and\r\nseveral other genera. Nearly all the family rely on microscopic\r\norganisms to get their food, and some close relatives, like the Indian\r\npipe, are saprophytes. There are over 70 genera and 1,200 species widely\r\ndistributed. Central Asia is the home of most rhododendrons and azaleas,\r\nscores of species being found in the upper reaches of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nThe Ericaceæ are typical of many families in the first group of the\r\ngamopetalæ, in that all of them, with a few exceptions like the\r\ncranberry, have a superior ovary. That is, the petals and sepals arise\r\nfrom the base or below the ovary, and consequently the mature fruit in\r\nsuch plants is never crowned with the remains of the withered calyx, as\r\nblueberries always are and all other gamopetalæ that have an inferior\r\novary. The character of having an inferior or superior ovary separates\r\nthe gamopetalæ into two large groups of families, the heath family and\r\nmany others, with superior ovary, and a few but numerically very\r\nimportant families that always have an inferior ovary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 98.--SWAMP AZALEA\r\n\r\nA shrub of the _Ericaceæ_, with white or pink sticky flowers and dry\r\ncapsular fruits.]\r\n\r\nTaking first the families that all have a superior ovary, we must, for\r\nlack of space, exclude most of them from here. A few of the most\r\nimportant, or typical, after the Ericaceæ, are:\r\n\r\n_Primulaceæ_--Primrose family. All herbs in which the stamens are as\r\nmany as the lobes of the corolla and inserted on them. The flowers are\r\nquite regular. They all have some form of a capsule for fruit, which in\r\nmost generally split lengthwise. Familiar examples include the garden\r\nprimrose (not the wild evening primrose), yellow loosestrife, the star\r\nflower, pimpernel, shooting star, and the beautiful cyclamens. A few\r\nmembers of the family are slightly luminous in the dark, apparently an\r\nattraction to night-flying insects. About 28 genera and over 400\r\nspecies, mostly from the northern hemisphere, a few in temperate South\r\nAmerica and South Africa.\r\n\r\n_Gentianaceæ_--Gentian family. Over 700 species in 70 genera, all bitter\r\nherbs, with opposite leaves, quite without teeth and beautiful,\r\nsometimes fringed, always regular flowers. In this and related families\r\nthe stamens are of the same number as the lobes of the corolla, and\r\nalways alternate with them. Gentian and sea or marsh pinks are our\r\nbest-known native representatives, while some related plants are\r\nmedicinal.\r\n\r\nThere are many other families in this part of the scheme of plant\r\nclassification that have minor differences among themselves, but agree\r\npretty generally in the number and position of their stamens, their\r\nsuperior ovary, and, on the whole, in the regular flower. Irregular and\r\nregular flowers may be recognized at once by cutting them lengthwise\r\nthrough the middle. In regular flowers there would be as much on one\r\nside as on the other of the dividing line, and in irregular ones quite\r\nobviously more on one side than the other. The character of all the\r\ngenera in a family having irregular flowers begins to occur here with\r\ngreater and sometimes exclusive frequency. In the mint family, or\r\nLamiaceæ, nearly all of its 160 genera and over 3,000 species have\r\ntwo-lipped or irregular flowers. The garden salvia well illustrates the\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe _Lamiaceæ_ or Labiatæ, as they are often called from the two-lipped\r\ncorolla, are herbs locally, but in the tropics often shrubs or trees.\r\nAlmost universally they have four-sided stems and opposite leaves\r\nwithout stipules. The flowers may be solitary, much more often they are\r\ncrowded into various kinds of clusters. The four stamens are borne on\r\nthe corolla tube, and nearly always there are two long and two short\r\nones. The family is universally fertilized by insects, and some of the\r\nflowers are wonderfully adapted for this end. Common examples, besides\r\nthe salvia, are mint, thyme, skullcap, hyssop, bugle, blue curls,\r\ncatnip, hedge-nettle, coleus, and Oswego tea. Most of the genera contain\r\nheavy odorous oils in their foliage, from which oil of mint, pennyroyal,\r\nlavender, rosemary, marjoram, savory and balm are the best known. These\r\nvolatile oils give to members of the family their characteristic and\r\noften very beautiful odors.\r\n\r\nThere are many other families of plants, some with irregular and others\r\nwith regular flowers, that appear to group themselves around the\r\nLamiaceæ, all of which agree, in spite of individual differences, in\r\nhaving a superior ovary. The remaining families of the gamopetalæ,\r\nhowever, always have an inferior ovary, usually obvious by the insertion\r\nof petals above the ovary, and in the fruit often conspicuous by the\r\nremains of the withered calyx still clinging to the top of the fruit.\r\nOnly two of the scores of families, with inferior ovary and gamopetalous\r\ncorollas, will be mentioned here, both of which are important.\r\n\r\n_Rubiaceæ_--Madder family. Common examples are the creeping bedstraw,\r\nthe sweet woodruff, partridge berry, button bush, and bluets or\r\nquaker-ladies. All, except one of these, are herbs, but in the tropics\r\nthe Rubiaceæ are nearly all shrubs or trees. Among those are the coffee,\r\nquinine, and ipecac. All the family have opposite leaves (a few\r\nverticillate) and stipules, regular flowers, with stamens as many as\r\nthe corolla lobes, and alternate with them. The fruits are a drupe,\r\nberry, or capsule. Over 340 genera and 6,000 species are known almost\r\nthroughout the earth.\r\n\r\n_Compositæ_ or _Carduaceæ_--The daisy family and the largest and most\r\ncomplex of all the plant families. As the culmination of the scheme of\r\nplant classification, they show the greatest perfection in the\r\narrangements for cross-fertilization. For a description of their flower\r\nstructure, see Chapter I, page 44, and Figures 43-45. Some of the\r\nCompositæ have no ray flowers, others are all ray flowers, but the great\r\nbulk of them bear both tubular and ray flowers in a single head. This\r\nmay be single, or more commonly it is arranged in various kinds of\r\nclusters. Each head is surrounded at its base by one or more series of\r\nusually tightly overlapping bracts, incorrectly called a calyx by the\r\nunobservant. The Compositæ include over 900 genera and 11,000 species\r\nfrom all parts of the world. Most of them in America are herbs. Daisy,\r\ndandelion, dahlia, chrysanthemum, sunflower, boneset, chicory, lettuce,\r\nand scores of other examples could be cited, all herbs. In the tropics\r\nthe Compositæ are more often trees and shrubs. The family contains many\r\neconomic plants such as arnica, chamomile, artichokes, inula, and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThis all too brief account of the grouping of plants in families, and\r\nthe sequence of these from the comparatively simple naked-seeded pines,\r\nthrough monocotyledons, the apetalous dicotyledons, followed by the\r\npolypetalous dicotyledons, and culminating in the Compositæ among the\r\ngamopetalous families, gives us merely a hint of what are the characters\r\nupon which plants are divided. While the details are necessarily\r\nomitted, the gradual development from naked-seeded plants, wholly at the\r\nmercy of the elements, up to those which are marvelously provided with\r\ncontrivances to insure cross-fertilization, has been traced. Perhaps no\r\nother phase of botanical study offers such a rich opportunity as this,\r\nfor upon the solution of some of the problems of plant classification\r\ndepends the answer to many questions about the history of the earth and\r\nman’s ability to live on it. Certain of these plant families have lived\r\non the earth hundreds of thousands of years before man first came.\r\nOthers have apparently arisen comparatively recently. Many botanists\r\nbelieve that all the monocotyledons should be placed after the\r\ndicotyledons, as the latter may be a more ancient type than the former.\r\nHow these different plant structures, some very ancient and others more\r\nrecent, help to show us some of the history of the earth, will be\r\ntreated, among many other evidences of a plant nature, in the chapter on\r\n“The History of the Plant Kingdom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nUSES OF PLANTS TO MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nFor perhaps the largest number of readers the chief value of plants is\r\nwhat they furnish in the way of food, clothing, fuel, and so forth, and\r\nfrom this standpoint alone the study of them is more than worth while.\r\nIt is unnecessary here to enumerate all the thousand and one things that\r\nwe get from plants, and no attempt will be made to do so in the\r\nfollowing pages. But certain plants like wheat, corn, cotton, jute,\r\nrubber producers, and tobacco have so shaped the life of the people, so\r\nabsolutely dictated the development of whole regions of the earth’s\r\nsurface that their stories are part of the history of mankind. What our\r\ncotton fields of the South, the wheat and corn fields of the Middle\r\nWest, the jute in India, and the coconut palm and sugar cane in the\r\ntropics have done to dictate the economic destiny of those regions is\r\ncommon knowledge. Hundreds of less important plants throughout the world\r\ncontribute their quota to the huge debt that man owes to the plant\r\nworld. Probably no other feature of plant life offers such attractions\r\nas the study of man’s uses of plants, which is known as Economic Botany,\r\nand for which our Government maintains a large staff of experts. Some of\r\nthe publications of this bureau are textbooks of the greatest value to\r\nthose who grow or import plants or their products. What that amounts to\r\nin the aggregate no one can readily estimate. It certainly exceeds all\r\nother commerce combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FOODS\r\n\r\nThose early ancestors of ours that roamed over northern and central\r\nEurope between the periods of ice invasion, which at times made all that\r\ncountry uninhabitable, tell us by the relics of them found in caves that\r\nagriculture was then unknown. Living mostly by the chase and on a few\r\nwild fruits picked from the forest these half-wild and savage people\r\nwandered wherever game was plentiful and the continental glacier would\r\npermit. But there came a day when one of these races began the\r\ncultivation of some of the wild plants about them and with that day\r\ndawned the real beginning of man’s use of plants. And with that day also\r\nthese simplest of our ancestors stopped their wanderings in large part\r\nand became farmers, albeit very crude ones, as their primitive stone\r\nimplements show. They did not give up the chase, but their collection\r\ninto more or less permanent camps or villages began with their\r\ncultivation of plants. Just when this happened no one can say, but most\r\nestimates of the time since the last ice age indicate that it could not\r\nhave been much less than forty thousand years ago. And considerably\r\nbefore this, and long before the use of metals by man, we find these\r\nstone implements of agriculture and the probable beginnings of that\r\ngreat reliance upon plant life which the modern world has carried to\r\nsuch tremendous lengths. Unfortunately we do not know what plants these\r\n“Men of the Old Stone Age” grew in their primitive gardens, and it is\r\nthousands of years after this, and after man’s discovery of the use of\r\nmetals, that we know definitely what plants he grew and how he used\r\nthem. Unquestionably some of the early uses of plants, such as dyes for\r\nthe face or for “rock pictures” are very ancient and are found long\r\nbefore any sign of agriculture, but as food in the sense of being\r\nproduced food rather than that gathered from the wild, there are only\r\nthe faintest traces until, in the remains of the lake dwellers in\r\nAustria, a single grain of wheat was discovered. Their metal instruments\r\nshowed them to have been familiar not only with this, but with other\r\nplants, and it is well to remember that these people lived far longer\r\nago than our most ancient historical records such as the Egyptians or\r\nChinese. Both the latter, so far as our oldest records of them show,\r\nwere an agricultural people who had enormously developed man’s uses of\r\nplants as compared with the men of the stone or bronze ages, whose\r\nagriculture must perhaps forever be a secret of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the grain of wheat in the remains of the lake dwellers\r\ntells us some things about men’s travels even in those early days, for\r\nwheat is not a wild plant there and must have come to central Europe\r\nfrom a great distance. Researches upon the home and antiquity of wheat\r\nare not very definite, but its occurrence as a wild plant somewhere in\r\nMesopotamia or the vicinity appears to be indicated. The Chinese grew it\r\n2700 B.C. and the earliest Egyptians spoke of its origin with them as\r\ndue to mythical personages such as Isis, Ceres, or Triptolemus. From its\r\nancient and perhaps rather restricted home it has gone throughout the\r\ntemperate parts of the earth and now forms perhaps the most important\r\nsource of food. Although many different kinds of wheat are raised in\r\ndifferent parts of the world most of them have been derived from one\r\nwild ancestor, _Triticum sativum_. Forms known as hard and soft wheat\r\nand dozens of others suited to different regions or market conditions\r\nhave been developed by plant breeders. As the most important of all the\r\ncereals it has been much studied, and its cultivation in America is on\r\nsuch a tremendous scale that we furnish a large part of the world’s\r\nsupply. Russia, Argentina, and the southern part of Australia also raise\r\nlarge quantities. The plant is a grass and the “seed” is really a grain\r\nor fruit in which the outer husk tightly incloses the true seed.\r\n\r\nIt were perhaps well to note here that popular stories about the\r\ngermination of grains of wheat taken from Egyptian mummies are not true.\r\nWheat and even corn are sometimes given to travelers, and it is taken\r\nfrom these ancient Egyptian tombs. But it was not put there by the early\r\nEgyptians, as the presence of corn proves only too well. For this cereal\r\nis an American plant unknown before Columbus and 1492. Arabs and others\r\nhave recently inserted various seeds in these mummies, some of which\r\nundoubtedly have germinated--hence the fable. The early Egyptians did\r\nput seeds in their mummy cases, but none have ever germinated.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN CORN OR MAIZE\r\n\r\nThe grass family furnishes this second most important cereal to all\r\nAmericans and Europeans, although among inhabitants of tropical regions\r\nrice is perhaps more important than either wheat or corn. With the\r\ndiscovery of America the early travelers found the North American\r\nIndians, the Mexicans, and the Peruvians all growing corn and using it\r\non a considerable scale. It must have been grown for hundreds of years\r\nbefore that time, as its wide distribution and many varieties testified\r\neven at that date. Its true home nor its actual wild ancestor has never\r\nbeen certainly determined, but a wild plant very closely related to our\r\nmodern corn is found in the northern part of South America, and either\r\nthere or in Central America is apparently the ancient home of corn. So\r\nmuch had corn entered into the life of the early Mexicans that the first\r\nEuropeans to visit that country found the Mexicans making elaborate\r\nreligious offerings to their corn goddess. And, as in Egypt, the tombs\r\nof the Incas of Peru contain seeds of the cereal most prized, which in\r\nthe case of corn consists of several varieties. While their civilization\r\nis not as old as certain Old World races, the cultivation of corn must\r\ndate back to the very beginnings of the Christian era. It is now spread\r\nthroughout the world in warm regions, and as early as 1597 it was grown\r\nin China, a fact that led to the erroneous notion that China was its\r\ntrue home. Perhaps no fact is more conclusive as to its American origin\r\nthan that corn belongs to a genus _Zea_, which contains only the single\r\nspecies _mays_, with perhaps one or two varieties, and that until the\r\ndiscovery of America _Zea mays_ or Indian corn was unknown either as a\r\nwild or cultivated plant. Such an important cereal, if it actually were\r\nwild in the Old World, would have spread thousands of years ago as wheat\r\ndid, and Columbus and his adventurous successors would not have brought\r\nfrom the New World a food that has since become second only to wheat.\r\n\r\nField corn of several different sorts, pop corn, and sweet corn were all\r\ndeveloped by the Indians from the ancient stock, but comparatively\r\nrecently the juice of the stem has been used for making corn sirup. The\r\nuse of the leaves for cattle feed is known to all farmers, and from its\r\nsolid stems it is now likely that some fiber good for paper making will\r\nbe extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE\r\n\r\nBoth wheat and corn are grasses that are cultivated in ordinary farm\r\nsoils, but rice is derived from a grass that is nearly always grown for\r\npart of its life in water. It is taller than wheat, but not so tall as\r\ncorn, and its wild home is in the tropical parts of southeastern Asia.\r\nIt is still grown there in greatest quantity, and in the Philippines,\r\nwhile only a small part of the world’s supply comes from the New World.\r\nThere are perhaps more people that rely upon rice for food than upon\r\nwheat and corn combined. It still is the principal article of diet of\r\nthe inhabitants of China, Japan, India, and dozens of smaller Old World\r\nregions, while its use as a vegetable in tropical America is practically\r\nuniversal. A considerable part of the starch manufactured in Europe\r\nstill comes from rice, and in India the intoxicating beverage arrack is\r\nmade from it. The Japanese saké, a sweetish intoxicating liquor, is also\r\nmade from rice. Notwithstanding its wide use it is not as nutritious as\r\nwheat or corn, being much lower in proteins than either of them.\r\n\r\nMore than 2800 years before Christ the Chinese cultivated rice, for at\r\nthat time one of the emperors instituted a ceremony in which the grain\r\nplays the chief part. It has been grown on land useful to almost no\r\nother crops as it is usually subject to inundations. Some varieties,\r\nhowever, have been developed which will grow on uplands and these are\r\ngrown even on terraced land both in China and the Philippines. It needs\r\na heavy rainfall, however, and grows best in lands that are flooded. It\r\nis occasional dry seasons that produce the famines of India when the\r\ncrop fails. The botanical name of rice is _Oryza sativa_, and it is\r\nknown now as a wild plant in India and tropical Australia. Its\r\nintroduction into Europe must have been long after wheat, for rice is\r\nnot mentioned in the Bible, and was unknown in Italy before 1468, when\r\nit was first grown near Pisa. Rice paper, which some people think is\r\nmade from this grain, comes from the pith of _Aralia papyrifera_, a tree\r\nof the rain forests of Formosa, related to our temperate region\r\nHercules’-club.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on what plants do with the material they take from the\r\nair and soil we found that sugar was one of the first fruits of that\r\nprocess. In at least two plants the overproduction of sugar is on such a\r\ngreat scale that our chief supplies of this substance now come from\r\nthese two plants--the sugar cane, which is a tall grass, and the sugar\r\nbeet. Hundreds of other plants produce surplus sugar, but for commercial\r\npurposes these two, and the sap of the sugar maple (_Acer saccharum_),\r\nare our chief sources of supply.\r\n\r\nCane sugar is an Old World grass known as _Saccharum officinarum_,\r\nfrequently growing twelve feet high, and with a solid woody stem, quite\r\nunlike our ordinary grasses. It looks not unlike corn on a stout stem,\r\nand it is the stem which is cut and from which the sweet juice is\r\npressed out between great rollers. The pressed-out juice goes through\r\nvarious processes in the course of which first molasses, then brown\r\nsugar, and finally white granulated sugar are produced.\r\n\r\nOur consumption of sugar is now on such a scale that we scarcely realize\r\nthat before the days of Shakespeare it was very scarce and expensive.\r\nEven as recently as 1840 it regularly sold in England for forty-eight\r\nshillings per hundred pounds, wholesale. At that time the total\r\nconsumption in the world was only slightly over a million tons, while\r\nto-day it is over fifteen times that amount. The plant is native in\r\ntropical Asia, but just where is not known, nor are wild plants found in\r\nany quantity. It has been much modified by long cultivation, and has\r\nbeen reproduced by root-stocks for so long a period that it is rare for\r\nthe plant to bear flower and seed. It has been known in India since\r\nbefore the Christian era, and was taken from there to China about 200 B.\r\nC. Neither the Greeks nor Romans knew much about it, nor do the Hebrew\r\nwritings mention it. Somewhere in the Middle Ages the Arabs brought it\r\ninto Egypt, Sicily, and Spain. Not until the discovery of the New World\r\nwas it cultivated on any considerable scale, when the climate of Santo\r\nDomingo and Cuba and the African slaves imported to those islands\r\nafforded conditions that resulted in Cuba at least being one of the\r\nworld’s chief sugar-producing countries. Sugar cane is now grown all\r\nover the earth in regions with a hot, moist climate, India and\r\nneighboring countries producing over half the world’s supply.\r\nPractically all the sugar produced in India is used there, however, so\r\nthat the American tropics furnish to Europe and America about one-third\r\nof the world’s total consumption of cane sugar.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 under fifty thousand tons of beet sugar were produced, while in\r\n1900 more sugar from this plant was made than from sugar cane.\r\nConsiderably more than half this beet sugar was grown in three\r\ncountries, Russia, Austria, and Germany, which explains what the great\r\nwar has done to the sugar market. The plant from which beet sugar is\r\nderived is botanically the same as the common garden beet, _Beta\r\nvulgaris_, which is wild on sandy beaches along the Mediterranean and\r\nCaspian seas, and perhaps in India. Much cultivation has made this\r\nslender-rooted plant into the large-rooted vegetable we now have and its\r\nsugar content was much increased by Vilmorin, a French horticulturist.\r\nMany garden varieties are known, and some of these are grown in the\r\nUnited States, where beet sugar is produced, although in 1910 less than\r\nhalf a million tons were made here as against over four million tons in\r\nEurope. While the beet as a vegetable was known perhaps a century or two\r\nbefore the time of Christ, it was not until 1760 that its sugar content\r\nwas understood, and it was nearly eighty years later before beet sugar\r\nbecame commercially important. Its cultivation in England on any\r\nconsiderable scale did not begin before the beginning of the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANANA\r\n\r\nAmong the largest herbs in the world are the ordinary banana plants, now\r\ncultivated throughout the tropical regions, but originally native in the\r\nMalay Archipelago. From there it spread into India, and the early\r\nGreeks, Latins, and Arabs considered it a remarkable fruit of some\r\nIndian tree. It is actually a giant herb with a tremendous fleshy stem,\r\nformed mostly of the tightly clasping leaf bases, the blade of which is\r\nfrequently ten to twelve feet long. In nature the blade splits into many\r\nsegments due to tearing by the wind, a process that the plant not only\r\ntolerates but aids. The leaf has a thinner texture between its principal\r\nlateral veins, and along these weaker parts the leaf tears so that\r\nnormal plants are usually almost in ribbons. The leaf expanse, without\r\nthis relief, is so great that tropical storms would doubtless destroy\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nMany wild species of the banana are still found in tropical Old World\r\ncountries, the genus _Musa_ to which the banana belongs having over\r\nsixty-five species. There are at least three well-marked types of banana\r\nused to-day, two of them, our common yellow one and a smaller red sort\r\nbeing fruits of almost universal use. The remaining type is usually\r\nlarger than the kinds sent to northern markets, is picked and used while\r\nstill green and is always cooked before using, usually boiled as a\r\nvegetable. In this form it is known as the _plantain_, and is a good\r\nsubstitute for the potato in regions where the latter cannot be grown.\r\nPlantains are used on a large scale in all tropical countries, much more\r\nso than the yellow and red bananas which are familiar enough in northern\r\nmarkets. These are too sweet to be used as a staple diet, and the\r\nplantain is practically the only such diet which millions of the poorer\r\npeople in the tropics ever get. There is almost no native hut but has\r\nits plantain field.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the banana plants, all of which appear to be derived from\r\nthe single species _Musa sapientum_ or possibly also from _Musa\r\nparadisiaca_, are borne in a large terminal cluster which ultimately\r\ndevelops into the “hand” of bananas familiar in the fruit shops. The\r\nplant then dies down and a new one develops from a shoot at the base of\r\nthe old stem. For countless ages this has been the only method of\r\nreproduction, and usually the banana produces no seeds. The plant is\r\neasily grown in greenhouses, one in the conservatory of the Brooklyn\r\nBotanic Garden producing 214 pounds in a single cluster consisting of\r\n300 bananas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh is usually credited with the introduction of the\r\npotato into Europe, although it appears as though the Spaniards were the\r\nfirst to bring the plant from America. It was brought to Ireland in 1585\r\nor 1586 and from its wide use there became known as the Irish potato.\r\nIts native home is in southern South America, and although Columbus did\r\nnot mention it after his first and second voyages, subsequent Spanish\r\nadventurers found natives on the mainland making extensive use of it.\r\nThere are now several wild relatives of it in South America, but their\r\ntubers are not so large as those of _Solanum tuberosum_ from which all\r\nthe different varieties of potato have been derived. The plant is too\r\nwell known to need description here, but its edible tuber, actually a\r\nstem organ, is often wrongly called a root. Figure 8 shows the tubers\r\nand true roots of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe sweet potato, which in early writings was often confused with\r\n_Solanum tuberosum_, is a very different plant. Its edible portion is\r\nthe root of a vine very like our common morning-glory or convolvulus,\r\nand its Latin name is _Ipomœa batatas_. The specific name is taken\r\nfrom a native American word, which due to early confusion was corrupted\r\ninto potato, and applied to the “Irish” potato. No one certainly knows\r\nwhere the sweet potato is native, but probably in tropical America. It\r\nbelongs to a section of the genus _Ipomœa_, all the other species of\r\nwhich are American, and before Columbus and his followers its\r\ncultivation was unknown in the Old World. It was very soon carried by\r\nthe Portuguese to Japan and other parts of the Old World, and for a time\r\nit was thought to be native there. America, however, is in all\r\nprobability its ancient home, although no really wild plant has ever\r\nbeen found there or anywhere else. Its cultivation from very early times\r\nin America is indicated, and Columbus upon his return from the New World\r\npresented sweet potatoes to Queen Isabella.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCONUT\r\n\r\nIt has been said many times that there are more uses for this plant than\r\nthere are days in a year. Wood, thatch, rope, matting, an intoxicating\r\nbeverage, and scores of other things are derived from different parts of\r\nthis palm, but it is as a food and beverage that its chief value lies.\r\nThe coconut palm is a tall tree with a dense crown of feathery but stout\r\nleaves and inhabits all parts of the tropics. It is found apparently\r\nwild along sandy shores, but its ancient home, while still unknown, is\r\nprobably America. Each year the tree bears from ten to twenty fruits\r\nwhich are at first covered with a green and very tough fibrous husk,\r\ninside which is the seed, the coconut of commerce. In the early stages\r\nof the fruit the white meat is preceded in large part by a delicious\r\nmilky liquid much used by the natives, but only rarely found in any\r\nquantity in the coconuts shipped to our markets. The meat is highly\r\nnutritious and is used on a great scale as food by millions of tropical\r\npeoples. Within the last few years a method of taking out the meat of\r\nthe coconut and shipping it in a state of arrested fermentation to the\r\nnorth has been discovered. This product, known as copra, is produced in\r\nenormous quantities, both in the Old and the New World, particularly in\r\nIndia and the Philippines. From this copra a palm oil is refined, which\r\nis the chief source of the nut butter now so widely sold. Some idea of\r\nthe extent of the cultivation of coconuts may be gleaned from the fact\r\nthat in India and the Philippines the trees are counted by the hundreds\r\nof millions. The oil from the nuts is also largely used in cookery, in\r\nmaking candles, for burning in lamps, and in making certain kinds of\r\nperfume. The tree belongs to the _Palmaceæ_, a monocotyledonous family\r\nof plants of great commercial importance. It is known as _Cocos\r\nnucifera_, and the genus has over a hundred species, all of tropical\r\nAmerican origin. Whether _Cocos nucifera_ is American or not is still a\r\ndisputed point. From the fact that it will float in sea water without\r\ninjury to the seed it has been supposed that it was carried great\r\ndistances by currents. It is found both wild and cultivated throughout\r\nthe tropical world, and its use appears to have been known to the\r\nAsiatics probably four thousand years ago. The curious fact remains that\r\nit is the only palm that, in its wild state, is known both in the Old\r\nand New World, all others being peculiar to one hemisphere or the other.\r\nPerhaps its capacity for floating in the sea without injury may explain\r\nwhat is otherwise still a good deal of a mystery.\r\n\r\nThere are many other foods derived from plants, besides all the fruits\r\nand vegetables too numerous to be noted in detail here. One fact of\r\nsignificance seems to stand out from a study of the uses of plants by\r\nman. There are three distinct regions from which the great bulk of our\r\nfood and many other useful plants have apparently come. One is the area\r\nof which Indo-China is approximately the center, and which is the\r\nancestral home of rice, the banana, tea, sugar cane, and many other\r\nvaluable plants. Somewhere in this southeastern corner of Asia there\r\nmust have been a highly developed agriculture which rescued these plants\r\nfrom the wild, and from which they have spread throughout the world. The\r\nsecond region, somewhere near Mesopotamia, appears to be the cradle of\r\nwheat and a few other useful plants. And the third region is the western\r\npart of America from southern Mexico to northern Chile, where corn,\r\ntobacco, the pineapple, sweet potato, potato, the red pepper, and the\r\ntomato were all discovered with the discovery of this continent.\r\n\r\nAlphonse de Candolle, from whose studies much of our information on the\r\norigin of cultivated plants is derived, once prepared a list of our\r\ncommon vegetables showing their ancient homes, their wild ancestors, and\r\nthe length of time during which they have been in cultivation. With some\r\nrecent additions and corrections by Dr. Orland E. White of the Brooklyn\r\nBotanic Garden, the list is printed below:\r\n\r\nThe letters indicate the probable length of cultivation.\r\n\r\n(_a_) A species cultivated for more than 4,000 years.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A species cultivated for more than 2,000 years.\r\n\r\n(_c_) A species cultivated for less than 2,000 years.\r\n\r\n(_d_) A species cultivated very anciently in America.\r\n\r\n(_e_) A species cultivated in America before 1492 without giving\r\nevidence of great antiquity of culture.\r\n\r\n(_f_) A species or subspecies of very recent domestication.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COMMON NAME          SCIENTIFIC NAME            DATE       ORIGIN\r\n  Artichoke, Globe     _Cynara Scolymus_ L.

BEVERAGES\r\n\r\nThe operation of the Eighteenth Amendment to our Constitution will stop\r\nthe manufacture in this country of the chief beverages that were made\r\nhere from plants. All wines and brandies were from the juice of the\r\ngrape, whiskey from rye and some other cereals, and beer from hops and\r\nbarley. Our three remaining beverages of practically universal use are\r\nnone of them produced in the United States, with the exception of a\r\nlittle tea grown in a more or less experimental way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEA\r\n\r\nIt is related in an old legend that a priest going from India into China\r\nin 519 A.D. who desired to watch and pray fell asleep instead. In a fit\r\nof anger or remorse he cut off his eyelids which were changed into the\r\ntea shrub, the leaves of which are said to prevent sleep. Unfortunately\r\nfor the story tea was known in China more than three thousand years\r\nbefore the date of that legend, and it is very doubtful if it was ever\r\nbrought from India to China. The wild home of the tea is apparently in\r\nthe mountainous regions between China and India, but the plant will not\r\nstand the frost, so that its cultivation is now mostly in parts of\r\nChina, Japan, India, Ceylon, Java, and some in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe plant is mostly a shrub or occasionally a small tree, with white\r\nfragrant flowers and evergreen oval-pointed leaves. All the different\r\nkinds of tea are derived from the single species _Camellia Thea_, the\r\ndifferences in color and flavor being due to processes of culture or\r\ncuring of the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--TEA\r\n\r\n(_Camellia Thea_)\r\n\r\nA shrub or small tree with white fragrant flowers.]\r\n\r\nWhile the use of tea has been known to the Chinese for over four\r\nthousand years, its introduction into Europe dates from the days of the\r\nDutch East India Company, who brought some to Holland about 1600, and by\r\nthe English East India Company, who sent some from China to England in\r\n1669. It fetched at that time 60 shillings per pound for the common\r\nblack kinds and as much as £5 to £10 per pound for the finer kinds. It\r\nwas almost fifty years, or about 1715, before the price fell to 15\r\nshillings per pound. From that time until the present there has been a\r\ntremendous increase in its use, although then as now the great bulk of\r\nthe world’s tea is used by the Mongolians and Anglo-Saxons. Just before\r\nthe war over 700 million pounds comprised the annual crop of tea. As its\r\nuse became general the English put a tax upon its importation into Great\r\nBritain or its colonies, with results here that we all know.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of tea is restricted to those regions where there is a\r\nlarge and frequent rainfall as well as a high temperature. It will not\r\ngrow in marshy places such as rice prefers, but needs light,\r\nwell-drained soils. The plant is propagated only from seeds which are\r\nsown in nurseries, and the young plants set out in the tea fields about\r\nfour and a half feet apart each way. In two years they are bushes from\r\nfour to six feet tall when they are cut back to a foot high. The\r\nincreased vigor of the bush from this severe cutting back results in a\r\ndense bush, from which leaves are plucked from the third year in small\r\nquantity. Not until after the sixth or seventh year is there a normal\r\nyield, which in an average year would be from four to five ounces of\r\nfinished tea. A poor yield of leaves would average about 400 pounds of\r\ntea per acre, good yields going as high as a thousand pounds or even\r\nmore than that. The tea fields must be kept free of weeds, a tremendous\r\ntask in a moist tropical region, which demands cultivation about nine\r\ntimes a year. The expense of properly setting out and maintaining a tea\r\nplantation is therefore considerable.\r\n\r\nThe plucking of tea leaves is a fine art beginning with the starting of\r\nnew growth and continuing every few days until growth stops. In certain\r\nregions growth is practically continuous and plucking also, but in most\r\nregions the plant has an obvious resting period, when it is pruned back.\r\nA properly cared for plant may last as long as forty or fifty years. In\r\na modern tea plantation the only part of the process of tea making that\r\ninvolves handling is the plucking of the leaves, largely done by women\r\nand children. The leaves are then spread on racks and allowed to partly\r\nwither, after which they are put between rollers so as to crush the\r\ntissue, thereby allowing the more rapid escape of water. After rolling,\r\nall black teas are again spread out when oxidation of their juices\r\nchanges their color, but green teas omit this second spreading out and\r\nsometimes even the first. The oxidation of black teas is produced by an\r\nenzyme in the juice, in green tea this process is stopped by subjecting\r\nthe leaf at once to steam. This kills the enzyme but preserves the green\r\ncolor of the leaf. In the black tea the enzyme is allowed to work for\r\ntwo or three hours when the leaves are again slightly rolled to seal in\r\nthe juices and the leaves are then subjected to a current of air\r\nprogressively warmer until it reaches a temperature well above boiling\r\npoint. Once the temperature reaches about 240 degrees the process goes\r\non only for about twenty minutes when the leaves are perfectly dry and\r\ncrisp. The different sized leaves, buds, twigs, etc., are then sorted by\r\nmechanical sifters and the finished tea is ready for packing. Experts\r\ndeclare that there is no difference between broken and unbroken leaves,\r\nand if there is any the flavor is probably better from broken leaves.\r\nFrom the upper three leaves and their bud the finest teas are made, but\r\nfrom adjoining plantations, even from the same plants at different\r\nseasons or different pluckings, vastly different teas are often\r\nproduced. In different regions the process varies slightly in its\r\ndetails, and different soils and culture undoubtedly affect the flavor\r\nof tea, just as they do other crops. Some of these local conditions are\r\nof great value, and the skillful handling of the leaves is as much of a\r\nfine art as it is a science. Unlike wines, tea is best when fresh and\r\nmuch of the romance of the sea centers around the China clippers which\r\nmade remarkably swift passages between China and England around the Cape\r\nof Good Hope. With the opening of the Suez Canal competition for\r\nincreased speed became still more keen, but steam vessels took the\r\nromance out of the trade. Much of the tea used in the United States\r\ncomes from Japan and does not go through London, which for over two\r\nhundred years was the tea market of the world.\r\n\r\nThe thing for which we drink tea is an alkaloid in its leaves that is\r\npleasant to the taste and refreshing to the senses. It is released in\r\nboiling water in a very few minutes, but if tea is allowed to stay in\r\nwater longer than this, tannic acid is also released. This is a\r\nsubstance found in the bark of certain trees and is used in tanning\r\nleather. As 10 per cent of the leaf of tea consists of this substance it\r\nmay readily be seen how easily improper methods of making tea will\r\nrender it not a refreshing and delightful beverage but an actual poison\r\nto the digestive tract.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE\r\n\r\nLike tea and chocolate, coffee also comes from a plant that can only be\r\ngrown in the tropics. Its original home was in or near Arabia and its\r\nbotanical name is _Coffea arabica_. There are, however, other species of\r\nthe genus that produce coffee, but _Coffea arabica_ is still its chief\r\nsource. The plant is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--COFFEE\r\n\r\n(_Coffea arabica_)\r\n\r\nThe coffee beans are contained in a red berry.]\r\n\r\nnow grown throughout the tropical world, but it does not thrive so well\r\nalong the coast as it does at elevations of a thousand feet or so,\r\nwhere, in America at least, the best coffee is produced. The plant is a\r\nshrub or small tree, usually not over 12 to 15 feet tall, with opposite\r\nleaves and small tubular flowers, followed by a bright red berry, which\r\ncontains the coffee “beans.” The flowers and berries are in small\r\nclusters in the axils of the leaves. Its use among the natives appears\r\nto date from time immemorial, but the Crusaders did not know it, nor was\r\nit introduced into Europe much before 1670. Its annual consumption is\r\nnow well over two billion pounds, nearly half of which is used in this\r\ncountry. We use over ten pounds a year for each man, woman and child in\r\nthe country, or nearly ten times the per capita consumption in England.\r\nBrazil produces over half the world’s total supply and consequently\r\ncontrols the coffee markets of the world. The plant was first brought\r\ninto South America by the Dutch, who in 1718 brought it to Surinam. From\r\nthere it spread quickly into the West Indies and Central America.\r\n\r\nThe coffee berries are collected once a year and spread out to dry,\r\nafter which the two seeds are taken out. This is the simple method of\r\nall the smaller plantation owners, but a modern Brazilian coffee\r\nplantation follows a very different procedure. The berries are put in\r\ntanks of water, or even conveyed by water flues from the fields, and\r\nallowed to sink, which all mature berries will do. They are then\r\nsubjected to a pulping machine which after another water bath frees the\r\nbeans from the pulp. The former are still covered by a parchmentlike\r\nskin which, after drying of the beans, is removed by rolling machines.\r\nThe coffee is then ready for export, but not for use until it is\r\nroasted. This is a delicate operation not understood except by experts,\r\nand should not be done until just before the coffee is ready to be used.\r\n\r\nThe average yield per plant is not over two pounds of finished coffee a\r\nyear, but larger yields from specially rich soils are known. The plant\r\nis rather wide-spreading and not over five or six hundred specimens to\r\nthe acre can be grown.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Mocha coffee is obtained in Arabia, where Turkish and\r\nEgyptian traders buy the crop on the plants and superintend its picking\r\nand preparation, which is by the dry method. Not much of this ever\r\nreaches the American markets, and the total amount of coffee now\r\nproduced in Arabia, its ancestral home, is negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE\r\n\r\nUnlike tea and coffee, chocolate is a native of the New World and was\r\nnoticed by nearly all the first explorers. It grows wild in the hot,\r\nsteaming forests of the Orinoco and Amazon river basins, although it was\r\nknown in Mexico and Yucatan as a cultivated plant from very early times.\r\nBy far the largest supply still comes from tropical America, although it\r\nis grown in the Dutch East Indies, Ceylon, and West Africa. It must have\r\nbeen cultivated for many centuries before the discovery of America, as\r\nscores of varieties are known, all derived from one species. This is\r\n_Theobroma cacao_, and both the generic and specific names are\r\ninteresting. _Theobroma_ is Greek for god food, so highly did all\r\nnatives regard the plant, and _cacao_ is the Spanish adaptation for the\r\noriginal Mexican name of the tree. Throughout Spanish or\r\nPortuguese-speaking tropical America the tree is always spoken of as\r\n_cacao_.\r\n\r\nThe chocolate tree is scarcely over twenty-five feet tall, has large\r\nglossy leaves and bears rather small flowers directly on the branches or\r\ntrunk. This unusual mode of flowering, common in rain forests, results\r\nin the large sculptured pods appearing as if artificially attached to\r\nthe plant. Each pod, which may be 6 to 9 inches long, contains about\r\nfifty seeds--the chocolate bean of commerce.\r\n\r\nWhen the beans first come out of the pod they are covered with a slimy\r\nmucilaginous substance and are very bitter. To remove this the beans are\r\nfermented or “sweated,” usually by burying in the earth or piled in\r\nspecial houses for the purpose. After several days, sometimes as long as\r\ntwo weeks, the beans lose the mucilage, most of their bitter flavor and\r\noften change their color. After this they are dried and are ready for\r\nroasting, which drives off still more of their bitter flavor. Chocolate\r\nis made from the ground-up beans containing nearly all the oil, which\r\nis the chief constituent, while cocoa is the same as chocolate with a\r\nlarge part of the oil removed. As in tea and coffee, there is an\r\nalkaloid in chocolate for which, with its fat, the beverage is mostly\r\nused.\r\n\r\nVery little chocolate is now collected from wild plants, and cacao\r\nplantations are important projects in tropical agriculture. Because of\r\nits many varieties, some nearly worthless, the business was rather\r\nspeculative until a few good sorts were perpetuated. Much valuable work\r\non this plant and the isolation of many good varieties has been done by\r\nthe Department of Agriculture in Jamaica, British West Indies. Cacao\r\nplantations are usually in moist, low regions near the coast, preferably\r\nprotected from strong winds, to which the plant objects. The trees are\r\nset about ten to fifteen feet apart each way and begin bearing after the\r\nfifth or sixth year. The young plants are always shaded, often by\r\nbananas, which are cut off as the trees mature. The tree will not thrive\r\nunless the temperature is about 80 degrees or more and there should be\r\npreferably 75 inches of rainfall a year, about twice that at New York.\r\nChocolate-growing regions are apt to be unhealthy for whites, and native\r\nlabor is practically always used. The business is very profitable, but\r\nstill somewhat speculative.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. FIBERS\r\n\r\nNot only do plants furnish us with food and drink, but most of our\r\nclothing is made from plant products. There is annually produced twice\r\nas much cotton as wool, while linen is made from the fibers in the stem\r\nof the flax plant, which is also the source of linseed oil. Fibers occur\r\nin many different parts of plants, but most often in the stem, or in\r\nthe bark of the stem. Some occur in the wood itself, as for instance\r\nthat in spruce wood, from which news paper is made. Others are found in\r\nthe attachments of the seed, such as cotton. Some are very coarse, such\r\nas that of _Carex stricta_, a swamp sedge from which Crex rugs are\r\nwoven. Others like that of the leaves of the pineapple are as fine as\r\nsilk, and in the Philippine Islands where much pineapple fiber is\r\nproduced, some of the most beautiful undergarments and women’s wear are\r\nmade from it. Again, others, such as Manila hemp, furnish us with\r\ncordage of great strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, perhaps a little rashly, that the value of the\r\ncotton crop in our Southern States exceeds all other agricultural\r\nproducts of the country. Whether this be true or no matters not, as\r\ncotton production and manufacture is certainly one of the most important\r\nindustries of the world. Our own New England mills and those in\r\nLancashire total an enormous volume of manufactured cotton goods, and\r\nwhat the stoppage of the cotton crop means to these industrial centers\r\nwas shown even so far back as the Civil War, when the “cotton riots” in\r\nLancashire were noised all over the world. Cotton is the most important\r\nof all fiber plants.\r\n\r\nThere are several different kinds of commercially important cottons, and\r\nperhaps dozens of others, all derived from the genus _Gossypium_, a\r\nrelative of our common garden mallows belonging to the _Malvaceæ_. By\r\nfar the most valuable is Sea Island cotton, derived from _Gossypium\r\nbarbadense_, which is probably a native of the West Indies, although\r\nreally wild plants are yet to be discovered. It is the kind, of which\r\nscores of varieties are known in cultivation, that is grown mostly along\r\nour southeastern coastal States. Next in value, but cultivated in\r\ngreater quantity because larger areas are suited to it, is _Gossypium\r\nhirsutum_. The fiber is a little shorter, but the total amount of cotton\r\nderived from this species probably exceeds that from all other kinds. It\r\nis the cotton grown mostly in upland Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, and\r\nthe wild home of this species is supposed to be America, although it,\r\ntoo, has never been found in the wild state. The third cotton plant is\r\n_Gossypium herbaceum_, a native of India, and the origin of many\r\nvarieties now grown in that country. It has a shorter fiber and is worth\r\nabout one-third the price of Sea Island cotton. From Abyssinia and\r\nneighboring regions comes the fourth important cotton plant, _Gossypium\r\narboreum_, differing from the others in being a small tree. All the\r\nothers are shrubby, while _G. herbaceum_ is merely a woody herb. These\r\ndifferent plants have been tried in the countries suited to cotton\r\nraising, but, generally speaking, the chief crop from each is produced\r\nin the country nearest the supposed wild home of it.\r\n\r\nIn all of them the fiber is really an appendage of the seeds, and each\r\npod as it splits open is found to be packed full of a white cottony mass\r\nof these fibers with the seeds attached. These white masses of cotton,\r\nor bolls, have to be picked by hand, as no really successful machine has\r\never been found for this purpose. Women and children do a large part of\r\nthe picking, and the wastage due to careless picking is tremendous. The\r\nwhole value of the cotton crop depends upon an invention by Eli Whitney,\r\nan American, of a machine to separate the cotton from its seed. This\r\n“ginning” machine is now much perfected and, in America at least, is the\r\nchief method of separation of fiber and seed. In India and for certain\r\nother varieties a different type of machine, known as the Macarthy gin,\r\nis employed. The latter is used in America also for some of the\r\nlong-fiber Sea Island cottons. With the baling of the cotton the work of\r\nthe grower is over and the product is ready for the manufacturers. The\r\nresulting seed, after ginning, once little valued, is now an important\r\nplant product, cottonseed oil, cattle feeds, soap, cottolene, fuel oil,\r\nand fertilizers being derived from it. Its value in the United States\r\nnow totals millions of dollars annually.\r\n\r\nIn growing cotton in America seeds are sown in April, and the beautiful\r\nyellow flowers with a red center bloom about June or July, followed in\r\nAugust by the pod. This splits open and is ready for picking by\r\nSeptember and October. The plants are grown in rows four feet apart and\r\nare set one foot apart in the row. Clean cultivation is absolutely\r\nnecessary, and in first-class plantations all weeds are kept out. The\r\nplant needs a rich deep soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMP AND CORDAGE\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of plants which furnish products known as hemp, but\r\ncommercially only three are of much importance, the plant universally\r\nknown under that name, the Manila hemp, and sisal. All of them are used\r\nchiefly for cordage.\r\n\r\nThe hemp of the ancients is a tall annual related to our nettles, with\r\nrough leaves, and a native of Asia. For centuries an intoxicating drink\r\nwas made from the herbage of this plant, and this with the narcotic\r\nhashish, which is made from a resin exuded by the stems, obscured the\r\nfact that _Cannabis sativa_ is a very valuable cordage plant. The coarse\r\nfibers are found in the stem, and these are cut and retted, the retting\r\nor rotting process separating the fibers from the waste portions of the\r\nstem. The fibers are so long and coarse that only cordage, ropes, and a\r\nrough cloth are made from them, but enormous quantities are raised for\r\nthis purpose, especially in Europe. As hashish is now a forbidden\r\nproduct in many countries, due to its dangerous narcotic effects, the\r\nhemp plant is more cultivated for fiber than for the narcotic. But in\r\nthe olden days hashish had a tremendous vogue in the Orient and was\r\nknown at the time of the Trojan wars, about 1500 B.C. Fiber from the\r\nplant was almost unknown to the Hebrews, and it was not until the\r\nbeginning of the thirteenth century that it came into general use. It is\r\nnow probably as important as sisal, but not as Manila hemp, the most\r\nvaluable of all cordage plants. The hemp is diœcious and the female\r\nplants are taller and mature later than the male. Two cuttings are\r\ntherefore necessary in each field.\r\n\r\nThe Manila hemp is derived from a banana (_Musa textilis_), that is a\r\nnative of tropical Asia and is much grown in the Philippines. While the\r\nfruits of this plant are of very little or no value, the fiber from the\r\nlong leafstalk is the best cordage material known. Also the finer fibers\r\nnear the center of the stalk are made up into fabrics, which are rarely\r\nseen here, but are said to be almost silky in texture. As a cordage\r\nplant, however, _Musa textilis_ is now easily the most important, and\r\nfrom a commercial point of view the Philippine Islands is the only\r\nregion to produce it in quantity. It has been tried with not much\r\nsuccess in India and the West Indies. Methods of extracting the fibers\r\nare still very primitive, as it is nearly all scratched out by natives\r\nwith saw-toothed knives made for the purpose. After the fleshy part of\r\nthe leafstalk has been separated from the fiber this is merely put out\r\non racks to dry. The finished product has so much value for large cords\r\nand ropes that the fiber makes up about half the total exports of the\r\nPhilippine Islands. Its great strength may be judged from the fact that\r\na rope made from it, only about one inch thick, will stand a strain of\r\nover four thousand pounds. No other fiber is anywhere near this in\r\nstrength and yet of sufficient length to be of use as cordage. There are\r\nstill thousands of acres suitable for its culture in the Philippines,\r\nbut the extraction of the fiber awaits some inventive genius who will\r\nmake a machine for that purpose. Many have tried, but so far the\r\nprimitive scratching out by natives is the only method in use and it is\r\nadmitted that it wastes nearly one-third of the fiber. The so-called\r\nManila or brown paper is often made from old and worn-out ropes of\r\nManila hemp, but, as in the case of cordage itself, adulteration with\r\ncheaper fibers is common.\r\n\r\nFrom Yucatan, the Bahamas, and some other regions of tropical America\r\ncomes the most valuable American cordage plant, known as sisal. The\r\nfiber is extracted from the thick coarse leaves of a century plant,\r\nknown as _Agave sisalina_ or _Agave rigida_, which looks not unlike the\r\ncentury plant so common in cultivation. The plant belongs to the\r\nAmaryllis family and is native in tropical America. Thousands of acres\r\nare planted to sisal in Yucatan and a machine for scratching out the\r\nfiber is in general use. The plant produces each year a crown of eight\r\nor ten leaves from three to five feet in height, each tipped with a\r\nstout prickle. Unlike the common century plant of our greenhouses there\r\nare no marginal prickles on the leaves of the sisal. After extraction\r\nthe fiber is stretched out on racks to dry and is then ready for\r\nmanufacture into rope.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUTE\r\n\r\nDuring the late war the Germans were reported to be sending flour and\r\nsugar to their armies pressed into large bricks for the want of bags to\r\nship them in the ordinary way. Gunny sacks, or jute bags, as they are\r\nmore often called, are made literally by the hundreds of millions, as\r\npractically all sugar, coffee, grains and feeds, and fertilizers are\r\nshipped in them. Jute is a tall herb, a native of the Old World tropics,\r\nbut suitable for cultivation in many other tropical regions. Practically\r\nall the world’s supply now comes from India, probably because of the\r\ncheapness of labor rather than any peculiar virtue of the soil or\r\nclimate of that country. The plant has been experimentally grown in Cuba\r\nwith entire success, but labor conditions made cheap production of the\r\nfiber impossible.\r\n\r\nThe jute plant, known as _Corchorus capsularis_ or _C. olitorius_, grows\r\napproximately six to nine feet tall and is an annual, often branching\r\nonly near the top. They are not very distantly related to our common\r\nlinden tree. At the proper maturity the whole plant is harvested and the\r\nstems are tied into bundles ready for the retting process. Of all fiber\r\nprocesses this is the most difficult, largely because no machine or\r\nchemical has yet been found to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--THE JUTE PLANT\r\n\r\nThe fiber is mostly derived from _Corchorus capsularis_ and from\r\n_Corchorus olitorius_.]\r\n\r\nextract the fiber of jute, or flax, and this is accomplished by placing\r\nthe stems in water, which rots out the fleshy part of the stem, leaving\r\nthe fiber. Some notion of the difficulty of this task in such plants as\r\njute is gained by realizing that over twelve million bales of finished\r\nfiber are produced each year, and that the retting may take from two\r\ndays to a month. The retting process is aided by certain organisms of\r\ndecay in the water, by the temperature, and by some other factors not\r\nyet understood. The process is allowed to go on only long enough to\r\nseparate flesh from fiber, which makes frequent inspection of the\r\nbundles in the filthy water an absolute necessity. At the proper time\r\nthe natives are able to split off the bark, which contains the fiber,\r\nfrom the stem, and while standing up to the waist in the water, he picks\r\nor dashes off with water the remaining impurities. The fiber is then\r\ndried on racks and subsequently, under enormous pressure, packed in\r\nbales of four hundred pounds each. An average crop would be about two\r\nand one-half bales from an acre of jute, so that in India there must be\r\nconsiderably over five million acres devoted to the cultivation of the\r\nplant. While for many years this tremendous output of fiber was sent to\r\nEngland for manufacture, power looms were set up in India about the\r\nmiddle of the last century. There are now over three-quarters of a\r\nmillion spindles there, and some jute is sent to the United States for\r\nmanufacture here.\r\n\r\nNext to cotton jute is probably the most important fiber plant in the\r\nworld. For hundreds of thousands of people in India and in England it is\r\nthe only source of livelihood. To the inventor who can eliminate or\r\nreduce the costly retting process of jute, or of flax, which goes\r\nthrough essentially the same operation, there is waiting a golden\r\nfuture, for it is largely the cheapness of labor and willingness of its\r\nnatives to stand in the retting pools that has made India the jute\r\nregion of the world.\r\n\r\nLack of space forbids mention of the many other fiber plants, some of\r\nwhich, like flax, are of large importance.

Few fields of inquiry\r\noffer greater possibilities to the economic botanist than fibers.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE STORY OF RUBBER\r\n\r\nAlong the north coast of Haiti, particularly near Cap Haiti and Puerto\r\nPlata, there are scattered a few plantations devoted to rubber growing;\r\nand it is not without interest that Columbus on his first voyage landed\r\nat about this precise spot in December, 1492, and found the natives\r\nplaying a game of ball made of rubber. He wrote: “The balls were of the\r\ngum of a tree, and although large, were lighter and bounced better than\r\nthe wind balls of Castile.” This is apparently the first notice of the\r\nuse of rubber, a substance now of world-wide importance, and derived\r\nfrom many other plants than the tree mentioned by Columbus. This is\r\n_Castilla elastica_, a native of certain islands of the West Indies and\r\nthe adjacent mainland, and a relation of our common mulberry.\r\n\r\nFor over three centuries rubber, or caoutchouc as it was often called,\r\nwas only of very casual use before the process of vulcanizing was\r\ndiscovered by Charles Goodyear, an American, in 1839. This combination\r\nof rubber with sulphur transformed a material much subject to heat and\r\ncold, and of almost no manufacturing value, into one from which hundreds\r\nof articles of daily use are now manufactured. Previous to this it had\r\nbeen used mostly, and in fact almost exclusively, as a waterproofing\r\nmaterial for cloth, a process much developed by the firm of Charles\r\nMacintosh & Co., who appear to have taken out the first patent for a\r\nwaterproofing process in 1791, in England. The rubber tree found by\r\nColumbus is still grown in considerable quantities and is a valuable\r\nsource of rubber, but it has been greatly overshadowed by a Brazilian\r\ntree which now produces over two-thirds of all the rubber in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--BRAZILIAN OR PARA RUBBER (_Hevea\r\nbrasiliensis_)\r\n\r\nNative in the Amazon region, but now much grown in the East Indies.]\r\n\r\nThis Brazilian tree, a native of the rich rain forests of the Amazon, is\r\n_Hevea brasiliensis_, and a relative of our common spurges of the\r\nroadsides and of the beautiful crotons of the florist, all belonging to\r\nthe family _Euphorbiaceæ_. The first important notice of this rubber\r\nappears to be by the astronomer C. M. de la Condamine, who was on an\r\nastronomical trip to the Amazon in 1735. He described _Para_ rubber, as\r\nit has since been called, and by 1827 the export of this gum had grown\r\nto 31 tons a year. In 1910 Brazil exported over 38,000 tons, nearly all\r\nof which was collected from wild trees. After the discovery of\r\nvulcanization the demand for all kinds of rubber increased by leaps and\r\nbounds and it became obvious that the wild trees, although tapped\r\nregularly, would not supply all of the necessary amount. For years the\r\nBrazilian Government protested the export of seeds or other means of\r\ngrowing the plant out of the Amazon, but in 1876 H. A. Wickam chartered\r\na steamer and loaded her with 70,000 seeds of para rubber trees and some\r\ncrude rubber, and had the ship passed by the Brazilian port authorities\r\nas loaded with “botanical specimens.” He safely transported the cargo to\r\nthe Kew Gardens, London, where only about 4 per cent of the seeds ever\r\ngerminated. From there the young plants were sent to India, where now,\r\nand in the Straits Settlements and the adjacent islands, there are huge\r\nplantations of para rubber. From the wildest speculation in rubber\r\nshares on the London Stock Exchange, which followed the successful\r\nintroduction of the plant into British possessions, the industry has now\r\nsettled down to be one of the most profitable in plant products of the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe rubber of both _Hevea_ and _Castilla_ is produced from the milky\r\njuice or sap of the trees and is actually a wound response. As the trees\r\nare tapped the _latex_, as the milky juice is called, runs out of the\r\nwound and upon reaching the air coagulates. This material is removed and\r\na new wound made, a process which is repeated for several years. There\r\nis still work to be done upon the problem of how often plantation trees\r\nshould be tapped to get the greatest flow of latex without injuring the\r\ntree, but in many plantations it is done every day or every other day in\r\nthe season, some rubber planters allowing a resting period during leaf\r\nfall, others again tapping almost continually. The actual wound is made\r\nby removing just enough bark to induce a flow of latex, but not until\r\nthe wound is completely healed, a process taking from four to six\r\nyears, can that particular part of the bark be cut again. With almost\r\ndaily tappings the problem of finding fresh pieces of bark into which\r\nthe cut may safely be made has been developed into a fine science. In\r\nthe wild trees of Brazil it is still done by natives, probably rather\r\nwastefully. Rubber plantations in the tropical regions of Asia now total\r\nover a million acres, as compared to only slightly over 200,000 acres in\r\nthe American tropics and from all other non-Asiatic sources. Of this\r\nprobably 100,000 acres are in Africa. At the present time nearly half\r\nthe world’s supply of rubber comes from these plantations, the balance\r\nstill coming from Brazil.\r\n\r\nThere are two other rubber-producing plants, neither of which are as\r\nimportant as _Hevea_ and _Castilla_. One is the common rubber plant so\r\nmuch grown as a house plant and said to be much cherished for that\r\npurpose in Brooklyn. It is a kind of fig tree, known as _Ficus\r\nelastica_, a native of India and the source of India rubber. It was used\r\nfor years, before the days of vulcanization, mostly for lead-pencil\r\nerasers. Thousands of acres of it in India were recently destroyed to\r\nmake room for _Hevea_, although it still produces a respectable amount\r\nof rubber, inferior, however, to _Hevea_ and _Castilla_. In Mexico a new\r\nsource of rubber is the guayule rubber plant, a small shrub native of\r\nthe drier parts of the Mexican uplands. It does not produce latex, as\r\npractically all other rubber plants do, but particles of rubber are\r\nfound directly in its tissues, mostly in the bark. While of some\r\nimportance, this shrub, known as _Parthenium argentatum_, a member of\r\nthe _Compositæ_ or daisy family, is not likely to become a dangerous\r\nrival of either Para or _Castilla_ rubber. Wild sources of guayule\r\nrubber are already reported as diminishing rapidly, so that its\r\npermanent success will depend upon cultivation. At least a score of\r\nother plants are known to produce rubber of a kind, but none of them\r\nhave yet been much developed. From most plants with a milky juice, such\r\nas dogbane or spurge, rubber of some sort can usually be recovered. The\r\nproduction of this substance is directly due to a response of the plant\r\nto wounds, and there are still great fields of research necessary on\r\nthis phase of plant activity, upon which a great industry has already\r\nbeen built.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. DRUGS\r\n\r\nNearly all the drugs and medicines of importance are of vegetable\r\norigin, and from the days of Theophrastus the study of plants as\r\npossible medicines has been one of the chief phases of botanical\r\nresearch. In the early days all that was known about plants was learned\r\nby men interested in medicine, and some of their quaint old books are\r\ninteresting relics of a bygone day. At present, pharmacognosy, or the\r\nscience of medicinal plant products, is a highly developed specialty\r\ntaught in medical and pharmacy schools. And yet the greatest medical\r\ncollege in this country has recently issued instructions to its staff of\r\ndoctors and nurses to pay particular attention to “old wives’ remedies,”\r\nmost of which consist of decoctions of leaves and other parts of plants.\r\nThey have done this because all the knowledge of the scientists\r\nregarding medicinal plants has its origin in the habit of simple people\r\nturning to their local plants for a cure. The accumulation of the ages,\r\naided and guided by the scientist, has resulted in the wonderful things\r\nthat can now be done to the human body through the different drugs,\r\nnine-tenths of which are of plant origin.\r\n\r\nThere is almost no part of a plant that, in some species at least, has\r\nnot been found to contain the various acids, alkaloids, oils, essences,\r\nand so forth, which make up the chief medicinal or, as the pharmacists\r\ncall it, the active principle of plants. In certain of them the most\r\nviolent poisons are produced, such as the poison hemlock which killed\r\nSocrates, and the deadly nightshade. And again the unripe pod of one\r\nplant produces a milky juice so dangerous that traffic in it is\r\nforbidden in all civilized countries, and yet later the seeds from that\r\nmatured pod are sold by the thousands of pounds to be harmlessly\r\nsprinkled on cakes and buns by the confectioners. Earlier in this book\r\nit was said that plants are chemical laboratories, and nowhere has this\r\nalchemy been carried to such a pitch of perfection as in the hundreds of\r\ndrugs produced by different plants. Reference to special books on that\r\nsubject should be made by those interested, as only a few of our most\r\nimportant drug plants can be mentioned here.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUININE\r\n\r\nThe Spanish viceroy of Peru, whose wife, the Countess del Chinchón, was\r\ndangerously ill of a fever in that country about 1638, succeeded through\r\nthe aid of some Jesuit priests in curing the malady, with a medicine\r\nwhich these priests had gotten from the natives. It was a decoction from\r\nthe bark of a tree, and its fame soon spread throughout the world as\r\nPeruvian bark. Even in those days malaria was the curse of the white man\r\nin tropical regions, and since then it is hardly too much to say that\r\nthe discovery of this drug has made possible for white colonists the\r\nretention of thousands of square miles of tropical country that without\r\nit would in all probability be unfit for occupancy. To the natives, too,\r\nquinine has been one of the greatest blessings, and in some of the\r\nremote regions of the tropics the writer has found quinine more useful\r\nthan dollars in getting help from fever-ridden natives, too poor and too\r\nremote from civilization to get the drug.\r\n\r\nFor more than a hundred and fifty years after the discovery of Peruvian\r\nbark it was always taken as a liquid, usually mixed with port, and an\r\nextremely noxious and bitter drink it made. The fine white powder which\r\nwe now use in tasteless pellets or pills has made the drug even more\r\nuseful than before.\r\n\r\nThe trees from which the bark is used all belong to the genus\r\n_Cinchona_, named for the first distinguished patient to benefit by it,\r\nand belong to the _Rubiaceæ_ or madder family. There are at least four\r\nor five different species. For many years Peru and near-by states were\r\nthe only source of the bark, and the English became convinced that the\r\ngreat trade in the drug would exterminate the tree, so in 1880 they\r\nintroduced the plant into India. These cinchona plantations now provide\r\nmost of the world’s demand, and some idea of what that means may be\r\ngleaned from the fact that in Ceylon alone over fifteen million pounds\r\nof the drug are produced annually. In India itself the plantations are\r\nlargely government owned and quinine is sold in the post offices at a\r\nvery low rate. In cinchona plantations strips of the bark are removed,\r\nand after a proper period of healing, the process is repeated. It takes\r\nabout eight years before it is safe to begin cutting the bark.\r\n\r\n\r\nACONITE\r\n\r\nMost doctors use aconite for various purposes and it is mentioned here\r\nchiefly as illustrating a common characteristic of many medicinal\r\nplants. The whole plant is deadly poisonous, and in the root there\r\nappears to be a concentration of this poisonous substance, which makes\r\nthe plant one of the most dangerous known. All of the drug aconite is\r\nderived from _Aconitum Napellus_, a monkshood, belonging to the\r\nbuttercup family. It is a perennial herb with beautiful spikes of\r\npurple-blue flowers, not unlike a larkspur, and is a native of temperate\r\nregions of the Old World. A related Indian species has been used for\r\nprobably thousands of years by the natives. They poison their arrows\r\nwith it and so deadly is the drug that a tiger pricked by such an arrow\r\nwill die within a few minutes. It is conceded to be the most powerful\r\npoison in India. Numerous accidents have resulted in Europe from\r\ncareless collectors of the roots of horseradish, who sometimes get\r\naconite roots mixed with that condiment, usually with fatal results.\r\n\r\nSo many other plants are violently poisonous, and yet yield the most\r\nvaluable drugs, that the greatest care has to be used in their\r\ncollection and preparation. The habit of many children of eating wayside\r\nberries should be discouraged, as some of our most innocent-looking\r\nroadside plants are actually deadly if their fruits or foliage are\r\neaten. Fortunately only a very few plants are poisonous to the touch,\r\nnotably poison ivy and poison sumac, and some of their relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPIUM AND MORPHINE\r\n\r\nAlmost no plant product has caused more misery and relieved more pain\r\nthan the juice of the unripe pod of the common garden poppy, _Papaver\r\nsomniferum_. From it opium is extracted, the chief constituent of which\r\nis morphine. If tea can be said to have precipitated our war of\r\nindependence, opium was indirectly the cause of the opening of China to\r\nthe western world. The degrading effects of opium had become so\r\nnotorious that the Chinese in 1839 destroyed large stocks of it, mostly\r\nthe property of British merchants, and prohibited further importations.\r\nIn the subsequent negotiations which ended in war, China was opened up\r\nto trade. No civilized country now openly permits the sale of opium,\r\nalthough there is still a good deal of it used in practically all parts\r\nof the world. The effects of lassitude, subsequent ecstasy, and\r\nstupefaction are due to an alkaloid, the continued use of which forms a\r\ndrug habit of serious consequences. Parts of China, Turkey, Persia, and\r\nSiam are said to be still large users of opium which is chewed, or more\r\noften smoked. Until comparatively recently fifteen out of every twenty\r\nmen in some of these countries were regular users of the drug. The\r\nlegitimate use of morphine by physicians has done more than almost\r\nanything else, with the possible exception of cocaine, to relieve\r\nsuffering, and there is consequently a considerable trade in the drug.\r\n\r\nThe home of this poppy is unknown, as it has been cultivated from the\r\nearliest days. The ancient Greeks and Romans knew it and the Egyptians\r\ngrew it for opium. It is still grown in India and China, where,\r\nnotwithstanding vigorous governmental measures, there is a large opium\r\nconsumption. After maturity the pods of the poppy, from whose milky\r\njuice in its earlier stages the drug is obtained, produce many seeds.\r\nFrom these an oil is pressed which is widely used as a cooking oil in\r\nthe East, and is perfectly harmless. The seeds are also used as bird\r\nseed and by confectioners.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCAINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--COCAINE PLANT\r\n\r\n(_Erythroxylon Coca_)\r\n\r\nNative in northern South America. The fresh leaves of this are used as a\r\nvaluable but harmless stimulant by the natives.]\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of South America the Peruvians and some of their\r\nneighbors were discovered by early explorers to be chewing the leaves of\r\na native shrub, apparently with much profit and no evil after effects.\r\nIt served them much as the betel nut does to the natives of India and\r\nother regions of the tropical East. With scanty or no food this\r\napparently harmless intoxicant will carry both men and women over\r\nperiods of severe fatigue. The shrub bearing these leaves is not over\r\nfour or five feet tall and has bright green foliage and small white\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nQuite different in its effects has been the drug which has been\r\nextracted from this plant, known as _Erythroxylon Coca_. Far from being\r\na beneficial and harmless stimulant, cocaine is now one of the drug\r\nevils of our time. Its use, outside that prescribed by physicians, is\r\nforbidden practically everywhere, but its consumption in this country,\r\naside from its great and legitimate use as a relief from pain, is still\r\nvery large.\r\n\r\nThe number of drug plants is legion, so large in fact, that volumes have\r\nbeen filled with descriptions and notes about them. A few of the most\r\nimportant, omitting those already mentioned, are listed below:\r\n\r\n         DRUG               DERIVED FROM THE                      NATIVE\r\n\r\n  Betel nut.

THE STORY OF TOBACCO\r\n\r\nNot until 1492 was the use of tobacco known to the Europeans, when\r\nColumbus found the natives of Cuba and Santo Domingo both chewing and\r\nsmoking it. Subsequent Spanish explorers of the mainland found its use\r\nalmost universal both in North and South America. It had apparently been\r\nused there for countless ages, as smoking it formed part of the most\r\nsolemn ceremonial rites both of the natives’ religion and their\r\npolitical gatherings. Brought to England in 1586 by Ralph Lane and Sir\r\nFrancis Drake, the smoking of tobacco spread with the great speed that\r\nsuch a comfortable habit might be expected to exhibit. Notwithstanding\r\nviolent opposition by certain priests and physicians and other more\r\nintolerant opponents of the weed, its use increased throughout the\r\nworld. To-day, in spite of our modern anti-tobacco fanatics, over two\r\nbillion pounds are produced annually, and in the United States there is\r\na per capita consumption of over five pounds per year, greater than any\r\ncountry in the world, save Belgium.\r\n\r\nAll of the many different forms in which tobacco is used are derived\r\nfrom the leaves of _Nicotiana tabacum_, or perhaps one or two other\r\nspecies of the genus _Nicotiana_, which belongs to the _Solanaceæ_ or\r\npotato family. There are many other species, all natives of the New\r\nWorld, but the actual home of the tobacco plant is in some doubt. As in\r\nso many cultivated plants, which have been grown for countless ages,\r\nwild specimens are practically unknown. The plant seeds freely and\r\nconsequently frequently escapes from cultivation, so that in many parts\r\nof America apparently wild plants are to be found that\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPERATE FOREST ON GARDINER’S ISLAND, LONG ISLAND, N.

Karsten._) (_After Schimper. Courtesy of Brooklyn\r\nBotanic Garden._)]\r\n\r\ntrace their origin to cultivated plants. The antiquity of its culture\r\nmay be gauged by the fact that in the most ancient Aztec tombs\r\nelaborately carved tobacco pipes have been found.\r\n\r\nThe plant is grown as a field crop in rows from one and one-half to\r\nthree feet apart and set about fifteen inches apart in the row. From the\r\ntime the seed is sown until the harvesting of the leaves is usually\r\nthree or four months, during which the plants demand the best of\r\nculture. In the United States thousands of acres of tobacco are now\r\ngrown under cheesecloth shades, an expensive process which is more than\r\ncompensated for by the improved flavor.\r\n\r\nOnce the tobacco is cut there begin chemical changes in the leaves that\r\nare of great importance to its subsequent flavor and use. These are\r\naided or induced first by a process of curing, which is accomplished by\r\nsuspending the wilted leaves in the sun, a process that has been\r\npractically abandoned for curing by artificial heat. The leaves are hung\r\nin a building where slow fires bring the temperature up to 150 degrees\r\nF., which is maintained for a few days. The cured tobacco is then\r\ngathered into small bundles which are stacked or packed so closely that\r\nfermentation begins, often generating a temperature of 150 degrees F.\r\nThe bundles are then reshifted and the process allowed to start again,\r\nwhich may be done several times, depending upon the quality of the leaf,\r\nflavor desired, and commercial requirements. Enzymes and bacteria play a\r\nlarge part in the fermentation process and inoculation of poor grades of\r\ntobacco with the organisms of finer grades has been tried. After\r\nfermentation has been stopped practically all tobaccos are aged for at\r\nleast two years, some for longer periods.\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, where its use was first noticed, the finest tobacco in the\r\nworld is still produced, notably in the province of Pinar del Rio. It is\r\nstill something of a mystery as to what peculiar combination of soil,\r\nclimate, or handling the unquestionable superiority of the Cuban leaf is\r\ndue. For one thing it is grown in the open, without shade, and is never\r\ncured by artificial heat. Nor is the very excellent cigarette tobacco of\r\nTurkey ever artificially cured. But attempts to imitate the conditions\r\nunder which these finest grades of tobacco are produced outside Cuba and\r\nTurkey have never been really successful, so that those countries have\r\npractical monopolies on the production of the finest cigars and\r\ncigarettes. The weed is cultivated nearly throughout the world, even\r\nCanada producing considerable quantities, but the best kinds and\r\ngreatest production is in warmer regions. It is second only to the sugar\r\ncrop in Cuba, and the United States produces over one-third the world’s\r\ntotal supply. Immense quantities are grown, however, in India and\r\nSumatra, and in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most unusual and localized conditions of climate and\r\nsubsequent handling are found in the production of perique tobacco. All\r\nthe world’s supply is grown on a ridge at Grand Point, in the parish of\r\nSt. James, Louisiana. The leaves are subjected to great pressure and the\r\nexpressed juice, after oxidation, is reabsorbed by the leaves after the\r\npressure is removed. The peculiar flavor is apparently due to this and\r\nto the damp climate. Perique is now used throughout the world as an\r\ningredient of the better kinds of pipe tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe diseases and breeding of different strains of tobacco are commercial\r\nfactors of tremendous importance to the industry. With a yearly value of\r\nwell over two billions of dollars, the crop is one of the most important\r\nplant products, outside of foods. The capital invested in America alone\r\nis over five hundred million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. SPICES\r\n\r\nAs we have seen many of our most valuable food plants are natives of and\r\nare now cultivated in temperate regions, but “sugar and spice and all\r\nthings nice” mostly come from the tropics. What we usually know as\r\nspices such as nutmeg, vanilla, ginger, mace, cloves, allspice, and\r\ncinnamon are practically all confined to the tropical regions in or near\r\nthe East Indies, only vanilla being of American origin. The trade in\r\nthese spices has been for hundreds of years a practical monopoly in the\r\nhands of Dutch and British traders, and for hundreds of years before\r\nthat the caravans from the Far East came laden with precious freight\r\nfrom the then mysterious country beyond the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANILLA\r\n\r\nThe long pods of two climbing orchids native in Central America and the\r\nWest Indies furnished for many years our only supplies of this flavoring\r\nextract. But in 1891 a process of making vanilline chemically from sugar\r\nwas perfected so that the vanilla trade is not what it was years ago.\r\nVanilla planters, however, have been able to keep up the price of the\r\nplant product because of its unquestionable superiority over the\r\nmanufactured article. But the latter has enormously increased the\r\ngeneral use of vanilla, while the total plant output scarcely exceeds\r\nfour hundred tons a year. Nearly all this is grown in the Old World\r\ntropics, as tropical America, where the plant is common enough as a\r\nforest orchid, has not greatly developed its culture.\r\n\r\nIn both species, known as _Vanilla pompona_ and _Vanilla planifolia_,\r\nthe orchid has flat leaves and a fleshy climbing stem that hugs tree\r\ntrunks or other supports, always in the dense shade of the tropical\r\nforests. It needs a hot moist climate, but if there be too much rain as\r\nthe pods are ripening they drop off, so that only certain localities are\r\nsuited to its cultivation. Various islands are apparently better suited\r\nto the plant than the mainland, Tahiti producing alone nearly half the\r\nworld’s supply. The species most cultivated is _Vanilla planifolia_,\r\nwhich came originally from southern Mexico, where considerable\r\nplantations are still maintained. The pods are about as thick as a thumb\r\nor finger and from five to seven inches long, and yellow when ripe. The\r\nripening process takes several months and when completed the pod is\r\nstill without the delicious fragrance for which it is famous. Curing by\r\ndipping in boiling water or by fermentation, a very delicate process\r\nrequiring long experience, brings out the flavor. In some regions the\r\npods are plunged into ashes and left there until they begin to shrivel\r\nwhen they are cleaned off, rubbed with olive oil, and tied at their\r\nlower end to prevent splitting. Still another process demanding that the\r\npods be plunged in rum is followed, but only in limited degree, owing to\r\nthe expense. In all of them the result is the same--that of inducing\r\nchemical changes in the pod which are responsible for its subsequent\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTMEG\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--NUTMEG (_Myristica fragrans_)\r\n\r\nA native of southeastern tropical Asia. The fruit, somewhat enlarged\r\nhere, consists of an inner part, the nutmeg. Around this is a “splendid\r\ncrimson network” which is removed by hand and forms the mace of\r\ncommerce.]\r\n\r\nA small tree of the tropical regions of eastern Asia, known as\r\n_Myristica fragrans_, or perhaps better as _Myristica moschata_, is the\r\nsource of both nutmeg and mace which come from different parts of the\r\nsame plant. The genus contains over one hundred species, belongs to the\r\n_Myristicaceæ_, and is scattered all over the Malayan region. Almost\r\nnone of its relatives, however, have the fragrance of the nutmeg and\r\nnone is used as a spice. Both nutmeg and mace have been known in Europe\r\nonly from about 1195 A.D., when in a poem about the entry of the Emperor\r\nHenry VI into Rome, the streets were described as being perfumed by the\r\nburning of nutmegs and other fragrant plants. It was not until the rise\r\nof the Dutch, who burned large stores of it at Amsterdam in 1790 in\r\norder to keep up a falling price, that nutmegs came into general use.\r\nThe trees are now chiefly cultivated in the Dutch East Indies, a small\r\nfraction of the supply coming from the West Indies, which is alleged to\r\nbe an inferior product.\r\n\r\nThe trees produce male and female flowers, usually on different plants,\r\nbut sometimes on the same one, yellow in color and aromatic. From the\r\nfemales are developed the fruit which is a drupe about two inches long\r\nwith a thick fleshy husk which splits upon ripening. The seed inside is\r\nthe nutmeg, but from its base is an outgrowth which covers the nut with\r\na “splendid crimson network.” This covering or network is removed by\r\nhand and forms the mace of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVES\r\n\r\nIn the family _Myrtaceæ_, which contains hundreds of plants from all\r\nover the world, mostly all shrubs and trees of tropical regions,\r\nhowever, there is a large genus, _Eugenia_. From the unopened flower\r\nbuds of _Eugenia caryophyllata_, a small tree native only on a few\r\nislands in the Moluccas, the widely used spice known as cloves is\r\nderived. It appears to have been known to the Chinese at least two\r\nhundred years before Christ, and was regularly imported into Europe from\r\nthe eighth century by caravans. Not until the Dutch began to import it\r\nby ship did it become cheap enough to have general use, but in 1609 a\r\nDutch vessel reached England with over a hundred thousand pounds on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nWhile the tree is of very local distribution, it has been introduced on\r\na considerable scale into Penang, Zanzibar, and even to the West Indies.\r\nTrees are set out thirty feet apart each way, and in from four to eight\r\nyears, depending on the locality, they begin to flower. After the full\r\nbearing stage is reached, a tree will produce from five to seven pounds\r\nof dried cloves, an average crop being about 375 pounds to an acre. The\r\nflowers are produced in small clusters not over an inch and a half long,\r\nso that hand picking is the only method of collection. As the buds\r\nbecome blood red they are usually in a fit state for picking, after\r\nwhich they are either sun dried or, more rarely, by artificial heat.\r\nNothing further is done to them before shipment. Zanzibar and Pemba now\r\nproduce more cloves than nearly all the rest of the world put together.\r\nOil of cloves, largely used in perfumery, is pressed out of the dried\r\ncloves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--CLOVE PLANT\r\n\r\nA native of only a few islands in the Moluccas. Cloves consist of the\r\nunopened flower buds of _Eugenia caryophyllata_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCINNAMON\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest trees in the lowland parts of Ceylon is _Cinnamomum\r\nzeylanicum_, a tree of the family _Lauraceæ_, which also contains our\r\nnative sassafras. From the bark of this tree is derived cinnamon, and\r\nfrom a related Japanese tree, _Cinnamomum Camphora_, camphor is taken.\r\nPractically all the _Lauraceæ_ are aromatic shrubs or trees, most of\r\nthem tropical. Ceylon was occupied by the Portuguese in 1536 for the\r\ncinnamon then growing on it, which they forced the native king to supply\r\nthem. Later the Dutch completely controlled the cinnamon, often burning\r\nit in Holland to keep up the price. The British, who took Ceylon in\r\n1796, made a government monopoly of cinnamon, but subsequently turned\r\nthe plantations over to private interests. The tree is now grown on an\r\nextensive scale, not only in Ceylon, but in Java and India. Ceylon still\r\ncontrols the cinnamon market, however.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--CINNAMON\r\n\r\nA common tree of Ceylon (_Cinnamomum zeylanicum_). From the related\r\n_Cinnamomum Camphora_ camphor is derived.]\r\n\r\nWhile the wild cinnamon trees reach considerable heights, the cultivated\r\nplants are cut so regularly that they almost always throw up a lot of\r\nyoung shoots from the roots, and it is the bark of these that furnishes\r\nthe spice. When the bark is fit for peeling, the natives cut off the\r\nshoots, and strip the bark from them by hand, but with a specially\r\nconstructed knife. After removal the bark is kept moist and in a day or\r\ntwo the outer skin is scraped off and the bark stretched over a stick,\r\nto form the familiar pipes or quills of cinnamon. These are graded, cut\r\nto uniform length, and after drying are ready for shipment. All of this\r\nis as yet hand work.\r\n\r\nOther spice plants and condiments are of wide use, but can scarcely be\r\nmentioned in detail here. A few of the more important are the following:\r\n\r\n         NAME                  DERIVED FROM THE                NATIVE\r\n\r\n  Allspice or pimento  Unripe fruits of                 West Indies.\r\n                         _Pimenta officinalis_\r\n\r\n  Cassia bark          Bark of _Cinnamomum Cassia_        Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\n  Black pepper         Fruit of _Piper nigrum_            Tropical Asia.\r\n\r\n  Cardamoms            Fruit of _Elettaria Cardamomum_    Malabar.\r\n\r\n  Capsicum or Cayenne  Fruits of species of _Capsicum_    Tropical Asia.\r\n    pepper\r\n\r\n  Coriander            Fruits of _Coriandrum sativum_     Europe.\r\n\r\n  Cumin                Fruits of _Cuminum Cyminum_        Mediterranean\r\n                                                          region.\r\n\r\n  Dill                 Fruits of _Peucedanum graveolens_  Europe and\r\n                                                          northern Africa.\r\n\r\n  Ginger               Rootstock of                     (?)\r\n                         _Zingiber officinalis_\r\n\r\n  Turmeric             Rootstock of _Curcuma longa_       Tropical Asia.\r\n\r\n  Mustard              Seed of _Brassica nigra_ and _alba_  Old World.\r\n\r\n  Thyme                Foliage of _Thymus vulgaris_       Southern Europe.\r\n\r\n  Caraway              Fruit of _Carum Carui_             Europe.\r\n\r\n  Caper                Seeds of _Capparis spinosa_        Southern Europe\r\n                                                          and Asia.\r\n\r\nThis brief review of what the plant world provides us with in the shape\r\nof foods, beverages, fibers, drugs, rubber, spices, and tobacco, does\r\nnot begin to tell us what man’s debt to plants really is. Thousands of\r\nplants, used by natives all over the world, may well provide future\r\ngenerations with unsuspected sources of plant products. No mention has\r\nbeen made of timbers nor all the forest products, except paper, which in\r\nthe aggregate total an enormous sum. Perhaps no better idea of the\r\ntremendous value of plants, of the absorbing interest their utilization\r\nhas always had for man, can be gained than to refer the reader to\r\nincomparably the best book on the subject, so far as tropical plants\r\nare concerned. Sir George Watt, in his “Dictionary of the Economic\r\nProducts of India,” a book of several volumes, most of which deals with\r\nplants, has left an imperishable record of man’s struggles to tame the\r\nwild plants of the forest to his needs.\r\n\r\nA few more economic plants not yet noted are listed below, and with this\r\nour account of plants as they are used by man must close:\r\n\r\n   PLANT PRODUCT              DERIVED FROM THE               NATIVE OF\r\n\r\n  Absinthe          Foliage of _Artemisia absinthium_  Europe.\r\n\r\n  Brazil nut        Seeds of _Bertholletia excelsa_    Tropical S.

For with plant materials, anyone\r\nwith the knowledge and taste necessary for work of this kind may paint\r\nliving landscape pictures that grow in beauty as their individual units\r\nreach maturity.\r\n\r\nIt lies outside the scope of this book to tell you the principles of\r\ndesign upon which such landscape pictures must be based to be really\r\neffective--that is the function of the landscape architect. But every\r\none of us knows when a house looks and is bare of vegetation about it,\r\nand consequently has the earmarks of being merely a house, but not a\r\nhome. A walk through any suburb of a large city or through most of our\r\nAmerican villages would convince the lover of gardening that we are\r\nstill miles behind England and many other countries in the love and\r\nappreciation of that kind of beauty in our home surroundings which plant\r\nlife alone can furnish. How unnecessary this is anyone can see by\r\nvisiting certain distinguished exceptions to the general indifference to\r\nplant life about our homes. Such suburbs as Brookline near Boston,\r\nGarden City and Morristown near New York, Guilford at Baltimore,\r\nGermantown near Philadelphia and many places on the Pacific Coast show\r\nwhat can be done to transform an otherwise indifferent landscape into a\r\nbeauty spot. While these are on the whole the homes of the wealthy,\r\nmoney is not what has made them, for thousands of cottage gardens in\r\nEngland are just as beautiful and have been made by people who live a\r\nbusy industrial life, but whose desire for beautiful surroundings makes\r\nthem spend their brief leisure in tending their flowers.\r\n\r\nWhile large garden schemes demand somewhat expert advice as to their\r\nplanning and arrangement, it is perfectly simple for anyone to begin\r\nplanting his own home grounds if he has in his mind’s eye the ultimate\r\npicture which he wishes his house and garden to become. But the habits\r\nof plants, their growth requirements, their stature, and particularly\r\ntheir colors are so various that, with the best will in the world, a\r\ngarden enthusiast without some knowledge of these things will get a\r\nwholly disappointing result. Certain plants will grow in some sections\r\nof the country, but fail in others; some flower in the south, but will\r\nnot do so in the north, and a few set seeds in certain places, but never\r\ndo in less favored regions. In the different sections of this chapter a\r\nfew good garden plants will be noted according to the regions to which\r\nthey are suited, but it must not be forgotten that some are suited also\r\nto other regions than the one in which they are listed.\r\n\r\nThose who have read the earlier chapters already know the difference\r\nbetween annuals, biennials, and perennials which comprise all the\r\nherbaceous plants upon which we depend mostly for cut flowers and in\r\nlarge measure for giving color to the garden. The woody plants are the\r\nones upon which most garden pictures depend for their permanent\r\nvalue--trees, shrubs and vines of infinite shape and foliage character.\r\nIn the case of trees, there are two major classes, those that drop their\r\nleaves in fall and are therefore deciduous, and of value chiefly during\r\nthe growing season; and the evergreens, which retain their foliage all\r\nthe year and make winter landscapes of great beauty. The garden\r\nenthusiast will very soon learn that evergreen plantings, while in many\r\nways the most beautiful, are much the most expensive and are never\r\nsuited to regions near big cities, for they will not stand smoke and\r\nother fumes as many deciduous trees will do. Nor will they stand violent\r\nwinds, small rainfall, and great summer heat such as characterize the\r\ncentral parts of the country. Their best development is therefore found\r\neast of the Mississippi and west of the Rockies, and generally speaking,\r\ntheir use in the garden should be confined to this region.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT MATERIALS FOR THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nTREES\r\n\r\nSo much of what makes landscapes permanently beautiful depends upon\r\ntrees that first place must always be given to them in any scheme of\r\nplanting. The location and ultimate spread of these trees will\r\ninfallibly make or mar any garden picture so that great care should be\r\nused in selecting and planting them. The actual planting details such as\r\npreparation of the soil and all the after care of plants cannot be dealt\r\nwith here, but many nursery catalogues give accurate directions and\r\nthere are hosts of books on the practice of gardening which give the\r\nnecessary information. In listing the different trees, symbols will be\r\nput before the names, indicating in which region they are likely to grow\r\nbest, as follows:\r\n\r\n   * Suited to the region east of the Mississippi and north of the\r\n   frostless region of the Gulf States, but not all hardy in the\r\n   northern part of United States and adjacent Canada.\r\n\r\n   ** Suited to the same general region, but most at home in the\r\n     northern part of the area.\r\n\r\nThose that have no symbol before the name are understood to be,\r\ngenerally speaking, hardy throughout the country, with, of course,\r\nexceptions such as the desert and alkali regions of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERGREENS\r\n\r\n  *   White Pine, _Pinus Strobus_.\r\n  *   Austrian Pine, _Pinus Austriaca_.\r\n  *   Scotch Pine, _Pinus sylvestris_.\r\n  *   Pitch Pine, _Pinus rigida_.\r\n  **  Red Pine, _Pinus resinosa_.\r\n  *   Umbrella Pine, _Sciadopitys verticillata_.\r\n  *   White Fir, _Abies concolor_.\r\n  **  Fraser’s Fir, _Abies Fraseri_.\r\n  *   Nordman’s Fir, _Abies Nordmanniana_.\r\n  *   Norway Spruce, _Picea excelsa_.\r\n  **  White Spruce, _Picea alba_.\r\n  **  Red Spruce, _Picea rubens_.\r\n  *   Koster’s Blue Spruce, _Picea pungens glauca_.\r\n  *   Engelmann’s Spruce, _Picea Engelmannii_.\r\n  *   Juniper. Different species of the genus _Juniperus_,\r\n        mostly low growing and suitable for ground covers.\r\n  *   Japanese Cypress, _Retinospora obtusa_. There are many\r\n        garden varieties.\r\n  *   Southern Cypress, _Taxodium distichum_. Not hardy in\r\n        the northern part of the area. Best in wet places.\r\n  *   Lawson’s Cypress, _Chamæcyparis Lawsoniana_.\r\n  *   English Yew, _Taxus baccata_.\r\n  **  American Yew, _Taxus canadensis_.\r\n  *   Hemlock, _Tsuga canadensis_.\r\n\r\nOf these the Austrian pine, hemlock, and the firs have the densest\r\nfoliage and should be used for such effects. Almost nothing will grow\r\nunder the evergreen trees, so close is their foliage. Lack of light and\r\nthe acid leached out of their bark by rains, stop the growth of nearly\r\nall herbs underneath them.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECIDUOUS TREES\r\n\r\nPlanted mostly for their foliage masses, but a few bear showy flowers\r\nand such will be noted. The same symbols apply.\r\n\r\n  *  American Beech, _Fagus ferruginea_.\r\n  *  European Beech, _Fagus sylvatica_.\r\n  *  White Oak, _Quercus alba_.\r\n  *  Red Oak, _Quercus rubra_, the most rapid grower of all\r\n       the oaks.\r\n  *  Scarlet Oak, _Quercus coccinea_.\r\n     Horsechestnut, _Aesculus Hippocastanum_.\r\n  *  Norway Maple, _Acer platanoides_.\r\n  *  Red Maple, _Acer rubrum_. Prefers moist places.\r\n     Sugar Maple, _Acer saccharum_.\r\n  *  Silver Maple, _Acer saccharinum_. Fine tree with interesting\r\n       branching, but brittle.\r\n  *  Tulip Tree, _Liriodendron tulipifera_. Showy orange-green\r\n       flowers.\r\n  *  American Plane Tree, _Platanus occidentalis_. A native\r\n       tree, but not so satisfactory as\r\n  *  Oriental Plane Tree, _Platanus orientalis_.\r\n  *  Sweet Gum, _Liquidambar styraciflua_.\r\n     White-leaved Poplar, _Populus alba_.\r\n     Balsam Poplar, _Populus balsamifera_.\r\n  *  Flowering Plum, _Prunus Pissardi_ and many other varieties\r\n       and species of the genus _Prunus_ such as Japanese\r\n       Flowering Cherries and Plums.\r\n  *  American Elm, _Ulmus americana_.\r\n  *  English Elm, _Ulmus campestris_.\r\n  *  Maidenhair Tree, _Ginkgo biloba_. Not hardy in the northern\r\n       part of the area.\r\n     Black Locust, _Robinia Pseudacacia_. Showy pink flowers.\r\n     European White Birch, _Betula alba_.\r\n     Black Alder, _Alnus glutinosa_.\r\n     Ash, _Fraxinus americana_.\r\n  *  Dogwood, _Cornus florida_. Showy white bloom. Tree will\r\n       not grow well unless in partial shade.\r\n  *  Cornelian Cherry, _Cornus Mas_. Covered with yellow\r\n       flowers before the leaves come out in early spring.\r\n  *  European Hornbeam, _Carpinus Betulus_.\r\n     Weeping Willow, _Salix Babylonica_.\r\n     Box Elder, _Acer Negundo_.\r\n  *  Magnolias. Different trees and some shrubs of the genus\r\n       _Magnolia_ all with showy flowers. Rather tender and\r\n       cannot be grown without considerable care, especially\r\n       when young.\r\n     Honey Locust, _Gleditsia triacanthos_.\r\n     Catalpa, _Catalpa speciosa_. Showy flowers.\r\n  *  _Paulownia imperialis._ Showy flowers, but not hardy in\r\n       northern part of the area.\r\n\r\nThere are many other deciduous and evergreen trees that might be listed\r\nand which will be found in the nursery catalogues of dealers in\r\ndifferent parts of the country. Some of these require special conditions\r\nof soil and climate and should not be planted unless these conditions\r\nare understood. In the frostless region of the country many plants can\r\nbe grown that are of tropical or near-tropical origin, but no list of\r\nthem will be included here. Some of them are hardy as far north as\r\nWashington, D. C., and are worth trying by anyone living in this region,\r\nas they give us effects not possible with the trees noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHRUBS\r\n\r\nWhile trees make the major feature of any garden, shrubs are chiefly\r\nused to fill in between them, or in small gardens the only woody plants\r\nthat can be used are often shrubs. Within the last two or three years\r\nthe Government has prohibited the importation of plants from abroad,\r\nupon the ground that various insect pests and fungous diseases were\r\nlikely to be carried into the country upon such plants. For this reason\r\nAmerican gardeners will have to propagate their own plants and we shall\r\nhave to use more native plants than European and Asiatic species, which\r\nmade up the bulk of our gardening material in the past.\r\n\r\nThere are excellent reasons for using native shrubs upon quite other\r\ngrounds than the difficulty or danger of importing foreign ones. Native\r\nplants fit into the natural landscape better than introduced sorts, and\r\nvery often the garden enthusiast can go out into the country and dig out\r\nsmall specimens instead of buying them.\r\n\r\nIn the list of native American shrubs given below, there are directions\r\nof where to use them, their heights, their flower color and other\r\ninformation about them that will help the amateur gardener to select his\r\nshrubs for definite effects. All of the shrubs listed can be gown in\r\nmost parts of the country, and from the list nearly every wish of the\r\ngarden planner may be gratified. This list is a practical one and has\r\nbeen used by landscape architects and others. It was written by the\r\nauthor for “The Garden Magazine” whose publishers, Doubleday, Page &\r\nCompany, have kindly allowed its use here.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that under each month group the names are arranged in\r\nbotanical sequence so that allied plants are brought together. All the\r\nninety-four species are offered for sale in American nurseries. Those in\r\nthe column “Remarks and Notes” as well as about twenty others not\r\nincluded, must be collected in the wild.\r\n\r\nA word now as to cultivation and care. Most of the shrubs, except those\r\nso noted, can either be planted in the spring or fall, as this is a\r\nmatter that should be determined by the planter’s convenience. In\r\ndigging the holes make them twice as wide and deep as the size of the\r\nroots apparently demand. Note carefully the column “Preferred Habitat,”\r\nso that the shrubs may find congenial surroundings. Pack the soil well\r\naround the roots, water thoroughly, and frequently if the weather is dry\r\nand windy. The first winter or two a heavy mulch of leaves, or leaves\r\nand manure mixed, to be dug in the following spring, will well repay the\r\nexpense and trouble.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that some of the shrubs are marked with an asterisk\r\n(*). These all belong to the heath family and require special treatment.\r\nA soil composed of rotten sods and leafmold, about half and half, is\r\nmost essential for the successful cultivation of these plants. They\r\nrequire peculiar acid soil conditions well approximated by the above\r\nmixture, and a mulch, preferably of red-oak leaves, or the leaves of the\r\nmountain laurel if available. Never disturb the roots of these plants by\r\ndigging in the mulch, which is better left on indefinitely. Soils with\r\nmuch lime in them must also be avoided when growing these heath-family\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIt is often somewhat difficult in arranging a shrubbery planting to\r\ngroup the plants according to the color of their flowers. For the\r\ngreater ease in using the larger table, and so that one can arrive at\r\nthe relative frequency of the various colors desirable for use in the\r\nscheme, the following table is appended. The numbers refer, of course,\r\nto those in the table below. The figures given in parentheses are the\r\ntotal of plants in each division.\r\n\r\n     _By color of flowers._ Yellow-green (10): 1, 8, 9, 10, 30, 31, 36,\r\n     44, 49, 86.

A\r\nfew American nurserymen are able to propagate them so that we can still\r\nget plants of these showiest of all shrubs. They should not be used in\r\nregions where there is scant rainfall, very hot summers, high winds or\r\nextreme winters. Their use is practically confined to the region east of\r\nthe Alleghenies.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN HERBS\r\n\r\nThe foregoing lists of shrubs and trees give sufficient information so\r\nthat all garden enthusiasts can at least make the broad outlines of a\r\ngarden picture. It must never be forgotten that these woody plants are\r\nthe only really permanent things in the scheme and should therefore be\r\nplaced with more care and thought than the herbs, which can be moved at\r\nwill. In selecting herbs, two chief divisions of them should be kept in\r\nmind; annuals which are planted for quick effects and which die down at\r\nthe end of the year, and perennials which live year after year and\r\nproduce flowers usually after the second year. It is from perennials\r\nthat the great bulk of our fine garden plants are derived. Planted in\r\nbeds or better yet among shrubbery or on shrub-backed borders they are\r\nthe most beautiful and most satisfactory of all herbaceous plants.\r\n\r\nMost of them may be started from seed in August of any year and grown\r\nalong through the balance of that growing season, after which they\r\nshould be covered up with straw or manure. The following season at least\r\nthree-quarters of them will flower and by their third season all of them\r\nwill do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOR, SEASON, AND HEIGHT OF HARDY PERENNIALS\r\n\r\nA study of the following list will show any garden amateur how he may\r\ngroup his perennials in borders or beds and how he can get different\r\ncolor effects at different seasons and in plants of different heights.\r\nThis admirable list of perennial plants was prepared by Charles Downing\r\nLay, a landscape architect, and published by “Landscape Architecture.”\r\nThe editors of that publication and Mr. Lay have kindly consented to\r\nhaving the list reprinted here.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +=================================================++====================================================+\r\n  |                    COLOR                        ||                                                    |\r\n  +----+-----+------+------+---+----+--------+------||             HARDY GARDEN PERENNIALS                |\r\n  |Pink|White|Yellow|Orange|Red|Blue|Lavender|Purple||                                                    |\r\n  +----+-----+------+------+---+----+--------+------||----------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |    |---- |      |      |   |    |        |      || Achillea Ptarmica fl.-pl., The Pearl               |\r\n  +----+-----+------+------+---+----+--------+------||----------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |----|     |      |      |   |    |        |      ||     Millefolium, Cerise Queen                      |\r\n  +----+-----+------+------+---+----+--------+------||----------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |    |     |      |      |   |  --|--      |      || Aconitum autumnale.

DAWN OF PLANT LIFE ON EARTH\r\n\r\n    “And the Earth was without form and void”\r\n\r\nThe quotation from the second sentence of the first chapter of Genesis\r\ntells us more in eight words than could very well be said in as many\r\nchapters. Not only have we biblical authority for this early absence of\r\nlife on the earth, but all the accumulated knowledge of the ages points\r\nin the same direction. We have already seen that plants, because they\r\ncan take inorganic substances from the earth and air and transform them\r\ninto organic food, must in all probability have come on the earth before\r\nanimals which, directly or indirectly, all rely upon plants for their\r\nfood. Even those animals that eat only flesh devour other animals which\r\ndepend upon plants for food. It may safely be repeated, then, that upon\r\nplants all animal life depends, and that, in the dim beginnings of\r\nthings on the earth, it must have been some form of plants that were the\r\nfirst living things. Extremely simple unicellular animals, however, are\r\nknown to date from early times.\r\n\r\nIn the volume devoted to that subject in this series, you will find that\r\nat the very earliest stages of what we know as our globe there was a\r\nsegregation of land and water somewhat different from our great oceans\r\nand continents to-day in extent and area, but differing mostly in\r\nthis--that much of the water was fresh and very nearly boiling hot. We\r\nhave still the remnants of those great reservoirs of hot water, as our\r\nhot springs and shooting geysers only too well prove. And if all plants\r\nwere as quickly killed by hot or boiling water as the common garden\r\ngeranium, we should not expect any plant life to have developed upon the\r\nearth until all those great bodies of water had cooled. To have waited\r\nfor that would have been to delay the appearance of plants for no one\r\nknows how many millions of years, and there is some fairly good evidence\r\nthat long before normal conditions of heat and cold were established\r\nthere already flourished certain kinds of plants. What those plants were\r\nis something of a speculation, and indeed exactly what they were no one\r\nknows. But in our present hot springs grow certain plants, microscopic\r\nin size, but quite obviously related to the algæ or to certain\r\nbacterialike organisms. They live with apparent comfort and reproduce\r\nthemselves freely in water so hot that no other form of life will\r\nmaintain itself. While there is no proof that these present plant\r\ninhabitants of hot springs, common in the West, are descended from\r\ninfinitely ancient progenitors, it is a fair assumption that some\r\norganism capable of growing in warm or hot water was the first living\r\nthing to appear in a world otherwise “without form and void.”\r\n\r\nThis great question of how plants came on the earth, and particularly\r\nhow from these apparently simplest organisms our whole wonderful\r\nvegetation has arisen, has always been one of the most interesting\r\nthings in the history of the world. There are many different ways of\r\nstudying this, and in the very earliest stages of plant development we\r\nare forced to reason, not so much by actual records or buried skeletons\r\nof the plants that probably existed then, for only a very few have ever\r\nbeen found, but by our knowledge of the physical and chemical\r\nrequirements of unicellular plants, and those slightly more developed,\r\nand of their individual life histories. It is, for instance, certain\r\nthat the first plants must have been aquatic, as no real land plants are\r\nknown for hundreds of thousands of years after the earth was quite\r\ncapable of maintaining plant life. The absolute necessity of water to\r\ncomplete fertilization in nearly all cryptogams also makes it fairly\r\ncertain that water plants, and these of the simplest nonflowering type,\r\nwere the first living things to be found on the earth. And it is more\r\nthan a fair inference that these were inhabitants of warm or hot water.\r\nSubsequently, as the water cooled, they may well have been not unlike\r\nthe green scum found on ponds to-day.\r\n\r\nOf course, the actual origin of life itself is still as much of a riddle\r\nas it was when the ancient philosophers began to speculate about it\r\nyears before the Christian era. Protoplasm, the unit or basis of all\r\nlife, while its composition and growth requirements are fairly well\r\nknown, has never been made in any laboratory. Nor have scientists ever\r\nbeen able to decide what the combination of physical and chemical forces\r\nmust have been to originate it. But that from a perfectly sterile,\r\nprobably steaming hot globe, there did finally develop some form of\r\nlife, and that this must have been aquatic plant rather than animal\r\nlife, seems not only certain, but the only hypothesis upon which all\r\nsubsequent development of life must have been based. It is not necessary\r\nto ascribe the origin of life to providential inspiration nor to the\r\nmeddling of strange and outlandish deities, as all savage tribes did and\r\nsome more civilized peoples still do. There can, however, be no escaping\r\nthe fact that life is more than the combination of physical and chemical\r\nconditions which sustain it, and that its origin has never, and may\r\nnever be “explained” by merely describing the conditions which\r\nunquestionably favored its appearance. In other words, the origin of\r\nplant life throws us back upon things believed but incapable of proof,\r\nand is none the less wonderful because we cannot yet understand the\r\nprobable progression of forces and materials to which it owes its\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, and we must all start with this proposition, that\r\naquatic plants certainly, and warm or hot water plants probably, were\r\nthe first living things upon the earth, what are the next steps in the\r\nhistory of the plant kingdom? The answer to that question involves a few\r\nsimple facts in geology and, particularly, in the making of fossils,\r\nwhich must be understood before we can see those steps or their\r\nsignificance. The geological changes which have resulted in the present\r\ncondition of the earth’s surface are described in the volume devoted to\r\nthat subject, and will not be repeated here. But some mention must be\r\nmade of the formation of fossil plants, particularly as it is upon the\r\nevidence of these that the story of the development of plant life is\r\nliterally written in the rocks.\r\n\r\nIf a leaf or twig drops into shallow water with a clay or mud bottom, it\r\nultimately sinks, and if then a film of clay or silt is brought down by\r\nfreshets or what not, it will bury the leaf or twig, of course, filling\r\nin every slight depression. If then the buried object were raised so\r\nthat it dried out and could be split open, we should find a perfect\r\nimpression of the veins and other outward characters of the leaf etched\r\nin the clay. This is often such a perfect process that every detail of\r\nthe leaf is left in the mud impression, and only the opportunity for\r\nthis impression to become hardened into rock is needed for us to have a\r\nfossil. For these are merely the final hardened rock stages of a process\r\nthat began as we have indicated, and the thousands of fossils that have\r\nbeen dug out of the earth prove how common the conditions for their\r\nformation must have been in certain periods of the world’s history.\r\n\r\nBut of the untold millions of fossils that have been made most have been\r\ndestroyed, for the geologists tell us that the earth’s crust has been\r\nsubjected to much upheaval. Mountain chains thrown up, inland seas\r\nformed, great river systems carved out, and tremendous periods of\r\nvulcanism or fire action have made the earth’s crust, at different\r\nperiods, a mighty restless place. And these changes, so slow that often\r\nmillions of years have elapsed before they were completed, have\r\nsometimes been favorable to the making of fossils and sometimes to their\r\ndestruction. Darwin once wrote about the fossil record that he saw it\r\n“as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing\r\ndialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone relating only\r\nto two or three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short\r\nchapter has been preserved; and of each page, only here and there a few\r\nlines. Each word of the slowly changing language, more or less different\r\nin the successive chapters, may represent the forms of life, which are\r\nentombed in our consecutive formations, and which falsely appear to have\r\nbeen abruptly introduced.” And yet it is upon the evidence of this\r\nfossil record that most of our knowledge of the history of the plant\r\nkingdom is based.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of getting any true picture of the beginnings of plant\r\nlife is great, for those earliest stages of development were\r\nunquestionably water-inhabiting plants, whose tissue is mostly too soft\r\nand too easily decayed to make fossil impressions of them likely to be\r\npreserved. Yet fossil algæ have been found in rock strata so old that no\r\nfern or flowering plant had yet made its appearance. It is not too much\r\nto picture the world then as peopled only by cryptogamous plants of\r\nsimple structure, living in the water, and land plants which to-day make\r\nup the bulk of our vegetation as not yet developed. Furthermore, there\r\nis in these earliest stages no trace of plants with any kind of a\r\nvascular system, such as all ferns and flowering plants possess. No\r\nstretch of our imagination can readily picture the earth as it in all\r\nprobability was in that period, with no trees or vines or flowers, the\r\nland wholly bare of vegetation, and in the water, along its sterile\r\nshores, only unicellular or slightly more developed, wholly nonflowering\r\nplants. The conditions supporting such plant life existed for many\r\nmillions of years, and some geologists have claimed that this period of\r\ntime exceeded all the subsequent ones combined, so that algæ and some\r\nother unicellular plant types are the oldest in the world; and they\r\nstill exist in enormous numbers.\r\n\r\nMuch later than this, fossil algæ of comparatively complex structure\r\nhave been found, showing by their frequency and more highly developed\r\ncharacters a more advanced stage in the development of the plant\r\nkingdom. So common were these various types of what we now call\r\nseaweeds, although most of them apparently lived in fresh water, and so\r\nwidespread was their occurrence, that this Pre-Cambrian period has often\r\nbeen called the reign of algæ. As yet no other plants had been developed\r\nand none of these ancient types had invaded the land, which for millions\r\nof years more must have been entirely without vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND PLANTS\r\n\r\nAfter the reign of algæ and other cryptogamous water plants, our\r\nknowledge of which is so unsatisfactory because of the incompleteness of\r\nthe fossil record, there appeared the first evidences of plants that\r\nwere able to live with “one foot on the land and the other in the\r\nwater,” so to speak. How many transitional stages there may have been,\r\nand what relation any of these may bear to existing plants, is not\r\nknown, or is, at any rate, so little understood that it is a disputed\r\npoint. But somewhere about this period there did appear plants capable\r\nof living at least part of their life on the land, and possessing in\r\ntheir vascular system a structure of enormous advantage over their\r\npredecessors. It is pure speculation as to what this first land plant\r\nwas derived from, or from what particular group of water-inhabiting\r\nplants it took some of its characteristics. Its appearance, in any case,\r\nwas a dramatic event of the first importance. Not the least interesting\r\nfeature of it is that the very plants of which we have indisputable\r\nevidences of being the first land plants have come down through the ages\r\nto the present day. For it is practically impossible to separate our\r\nmodern representative from its ancient ancestor, despite all the\r\ntremendous changes that have been going on both in the history of the\r\nearth’s crust and in the vicissitudes of the vegetation in meeting those\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThere is the best of evidence that these first land plants were of the\r\nclub moss family, which are relatives of the ferns. One of them,\r\nrepresenting our present _Lycopodium Selago_ (Figure 107) so closely as\r\nto be practically indistinguishable, is a common type, as revealed to us\r\nin the fossil record. The present plant inhabits rich, moist, and mostly\r\nevergreen woods in the northern part of the globe, and is common in the\r\nAdirondack and White Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--CLUB MOSS\r\n\r\n(_Lycopodium Selago_)\r\n\r\nA club moss which has come down through the ages almost unchanged from\r\nthe days when coal was being formed. Grows to-day in the north temperate\r\nzone, particularly in mountains.]\r\n\r\nNor was the earth peopled wholly by this ancestor of _Lycopodium\r\nSelago_, for we find at this time, or just after it, a great development\r\nof plants of this type. Some of these were giant, treelike club-mosses\r\nthat have been so well preserved as fossils that even their internal\r\nstructure and spore-bearing characters are well known. Many other\r\nstrange relatives of our modern club mosses flourished in those days,\r\nsome of which have wholly disappeared, as have all the treelike forms.\r\nThese highly organized club mosses, quite unlike any modern\r\nrepresentative of the family, appear to have been crowded off the earth\r\nby other and subsequent types of vegetation, while _Lycopodium Selago_,\r\nand about thirty related species, have persisted to the present day; not\r\nprecisely in all cases as they were in this dawn of a land flora, but in\r\nmany cases with modern structure and reproductive processes so close to\r\nthe ancestral types as to be nearly identical.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing gives one a better impression of the tremendous time\r\nthat must have elapsed before the appearance of these ancient club\r\nmosses than the very slight modifications from their ancient condition\r\nwhich their structure at the present time exhibits. While nothing is\r\ncertainly known of their origin, when they first appeared they were\r\nplants with a well-developed vascular system, having stems and leaves\r\nquite unlike any of their predecessors’, and a reproductive process\r\nalmost precisely like their modern descendants. In other words, if they\r\nhave changed so slightly in all the millions of years since our\r\nrock-written records of them first occur, what an infinitely greater\r\nperiod must have elapsed down the dim vista of the ages before their\r\nappearance. Of this period, with the exception of fossil algæ, we know\r\npractically nothing, and, worst of all, the actual transition from a\r\nwholly water-inhabiting flora to these certainly land-inhabiting club\r\nmosses may never be known. For, added to the difficulty of water plants\r\nbeing preserved as fossils, already mentioned, is the fact that as they\r\nare the oldest, they are found in the deepest strata and, consequently,\r\nthe hardest to find; and due to changes in the earth’s crust, these\r\nancient fossil-bearing strata have often been much disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion appears to be indicated that the origin of a land flora\r\ncame about with the appearance of these ancient club mosses, which are\r\nnot mosses in our present-day interpretation of those plants, and that\r\nat about the same period many other plants also were found, the whole\r\nvegetation resembling nothing that exists at the present time, but many\r\nof the different kinds of this ancient flora showed unmistakable\r\nevidence of being the progenitors of many plants that exist to-day. What\r\nthese were, and particularly what they accomplished, both in the history\r\nof the plant kingdom and in making the world habitable for man who did\r\nnot come for millions of years after they were preparing the way, will\r\nbe considered in\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CARBONIFEROUS PLANTS AND THE FORMATION OF COAL\r\n\r\nThe carboniferous time, or the period when the earth was covered with\r\nhuge forests of strange shrubs and trees, most of which were unlike\r\ntheir modern successors, apparently had a climate so nearly uniform and\r\nseasonless that fossil remains of these plants have been found\r\nthroughout the world. Even in the Arctic the rock strata show the\r\nflourishing of forests that must have needed a climate very different\r\nfrom the frigid condition there to-day, and furnishing indisputable\r\nevidence of a warm, most probably frostless, climate practically\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--HORSETAIL\r\n\r\n(_Equisetum hyemale_)\r\n\r\nA modern horsetail or scouring rush, common in the north temperate zone.\r\nAncestors of these formed huge forests at the time that coal was being\r\nformed.]\r\n\r\nThe giant club mosses have already been mentioned, with their\r\npersistence to the present day in much reduced number, and vastly\r\nreduced sizes. No one can picture the grandeur of those ancient forests,\r\npeopled with queer animals long since extinct and with dragon flies\r\nknown to have a wing-spread of two feet or more. But with the club\r\nmosses were giant horsetails, which in somewhat changed form have also\r\ncome down to our times, but in much reduced stature and frequently are\r\nfamiliar enough as weedy plants along railway embankments, and\r\nsometimes in more natural environments. Most of our modern\r\nrepresentatives of the genus _Equisetum_ (Figure 108), or horsetails,\r\nare low herbs, but one South American kind still retains the ancient\r\nhabit of growing to considerable heights, as specimens up to twenty feet\r\nhigh are known. Related to the ancient treelike horsetails were queer\r\nvines with slender twining stems, which, judging from their fossil\r\nremains, must have been very common. Both the ancestors of our club\r\nmosses and the horsetails must have occupied vast swampy areas, as their\r\nstem structure indicates a fondness for water, to which, as we have\r\nalready seen, their still more ancient ancestors were always confined.\r\n\r\nVigorously competing with these plants for occupancy of those great\r\nswamps were vast quantities of plants that have been called cycadlike\r\nferns from their likeness to ferns on the one hand and plants like the\r\nso-called sago palm on the other. The sago palm, or _Cycas revoluta_, is\r\na modern representative of these ancient forms, and retains the\r\nremarkable characteristic of having its male fertilizing cell capable of\r\nmovement as we know to be the case in nearly all cryptogamous plants.\r\nYet _Cycas_, with its related genera, which are found in nearly all the\r\nwarmer parts of the earth to-day, are true flowering plants which bear\r\ncones. We see, therefore, in these old cycadlike ferns one of the first,\r\nalmost experimental, evidences of the seed habit, and consequently the\r\nbreaking away from the spore habit which overwhelmingly characterized\r\nthe reproductive processes of its ancient associates.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of higher parts of that dim, mysterious world, of which\r\nwe know only that part revealed in the fossil record, were largely\r\nancestors of our modern cone-bearing evergreens. They are known as\r\n_Cordaitales_ and have long since disappeared. Forming forests of huge\r\nsize and making long, slender trunks with a crown of leaves at the top\r\nnot unlike some modern conifers to which they are, of course, related,\r\nthese progenitors of our pines and spruces must have been striking\r\nobjects of that strange landscape. Rooted stumps of these ancient trees\r\nhave been uncovered, and their narrow leaves, often three feet long, are\r\ncommon as fossils. By some our present conifers and the _Cordaitales_\r\nare both thought to be descendants from a still more ancient group, of\r\nwhich the existence is only conjectured.\r\n\r\nWe can, perhaps, best summarize our sketch of the plant life existing at\r\nthe close of this period by saying that all the forms show unmistakable\r\nevidence of being crytogamous so far as their reproductive processes are\r\nconcerned, or else, as in the progenitors of our conifers and cycads,\r\nthe beginnings of a definite seed habit are indicated. Most of the\r\nlowland representatives of this flora were cryptogamous in their\r\ncharacters and ancestry, while some of them, and nearly all the flora of\r\ndrier sites, appear to have shown the beginnings of flower production.\r\nSome of these flowers, which are always cones, are unmistakable as such,\r\nand pollen in tremendous quantities has been found among their buried\r\nremains. These cones belong to trees that are actual gymnosperms or\r\nobvious ancestors of them, for no herbs are known as yet. Nor are\r\nangiospermous flowering plants known from this period, nor have any ever\r\nbeen found in strata millions of years younger than the fossil-bearing\r\nstrata of this age of the ancestors of our modern ferns, conifers, or\r\ncycads.\r\n\r\nNor must we picture the development of these different plant inhabitants\r\nof that time as passing from one to another in orderly sequence, for\r\nthat would give us the impression of a regular progression from simple\r\nto complex, which may or may not be the truth. There appears to be such\r\na sequence, and the internal structure of the remains of many of these\r\nancient types of plant life have greatly aided our ability to understand\r\ntheir relationships. But with the possibility of various reproductive\r\nprocesses or other structures appearing in quite unrelated forms, and\r\nwith the comparative paucity of the fossil record in mind, no one can\r\nsay for certain what are the true lines of descent. The necessity for\r\nwater in the reproductive act of nearly all the crytogams, the origin of\r\nthe vascular structure, and the consequent ability to live upon the\r\nland, and finally the production of a conelike flower structure with\r\npollen, and all that that implies, are all found during this period.\r\n\r\nTo the vegetation inhabiting the swamps during this period, man owes a\r\ndebt perhaps as great as to our modern food plants, for it is upon this,\r\nand some later plant remains, that we rely for coal. This period has\r\nbeen well called the Carboniferous, for its chief claim to attention,\r\noutside the realms of botanical research, was the deposition of those\r\ngreat collections of plant remains, which, as coal, contain as high as\r\n90 per cent of carbon and furnish the fuel of the world. This is\r\nscarcely the place or time to go into the composition of different kinds\r\nof coal, but some mention of the conditions under which these ancient\r\nswampy forests were transformed into that valuable substance may well\r\nconclude the account of a vegetation period the history of which has in\r\nlarge part been found written in the very strata from which coal itself\r\nis derived.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest and wettest parts of those forests there occurred, just as\r\nthere may occur to-day, a large accumulation of fallen trees and other\r\nvegetable refuse. In the ordinary way these would simply rot, due to the\r\nwork of insects and the fungi of decay, and in a few score years there\r\nwould be nothing to show. “Dust to dust” would be, and is, the history\r\nof so many living things that it is only some machinery for arresting\r\nthis process which will give us very different results. In the case of\r\ncoal formation the original impetus appears to be certain microscopic\r\norganisms, probably saprophytic fungi, fossil remains of which have been\r\nidentified, which work upon the fallen mass of vegetation and start its\r\ndecay, but which can only do so while their prey is still within the\r\ninfluence of the air. The initial stages of decay must, therefore, have\r\nbeen going on while the water was low enough for these organisms to\r\nwork. But in many parts of that ancient landscape the water level was a\r\nfluctuating quantity, due to local conditions or to changes in the\r\nearth’s crust. So that many times partially decomposed vegetation masses\r\nwould become submerged, stopping the work of these organisms of decay\r\nthat demand air, but providing the only conditions under which certain\r\nothers could complete the transformation. These bacterial organisms that\r\nwill work only when deprived of air continue the process, but in a\r\ndifferent way. For one thing, the lack of air delays decomposition or\r\nalmost stops it, as witness the resistance of logs under water, some of\r\nwhich are known to be hundreds of years old. And forest stumps off the\r\ncoast of Cape May, in New Jersey, are in nearly as perfect a state as\r\nwhen first submerged, over 40,000 years ago. In the production of coal\r\nthese anærobic (living without air) bacteria release oxygen and hydrogen\r\nfrom the partly decayed mass, leaving as a residue a substance known as\r\npeat, which is largely carbon. The transformation of peat into coal\r\ndepends upon requisite pressure of the strata that may be laid down on\r\ntop of the peat bed, and probably upon chemical changes that go on after\r\nsuch covering strata have been laid down.\r\n\r\nThe fact that coal is sometimes found only in thin veins, with layers of\r\nshale and other material between, tells us that its origin must often\r\nhave been a precarious affair, where alternate emergence and submergence\r\nwould permit first the vegetation to develop and then its transformation\r\nto peat, followed by the deposition of fine sands or silt covering the\r\nbed. Several such cycles occurred, sometimes separated by untold ages of\r\ntime, or again by much briefer periods. Certain mines, however, contain\r\nover 200 feet of solid coal. The length of time necessary for such a\r\nvast accumulation, or how many generations of these ancient plants went\r\ninto their making, is beyond calculation. With the mining of coal\r\nrunning into the hundreds of millions of tons yearly, we get some idea\r\nof how great were those Carboniferous forests, and how extensive they\r\nwere is proved from the widely separated localities in which coal mines\r\nare found.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous age of fern, cycad, and conifer ancestors was by no\r\nmeans a quiet, orderly period, as from geological evidence it appears to\r\nhave been much subject to alternate emergence and submergence of great\r\ntracts of land. Compared with what followed, it actually was a period of\r\ncomparative quietness, however, and it must, in at least most parts of\r\nthe world, have permitted the slow development of certain of its plant\r\ngroups to a state of perfection never reached since. This is\r\nparticularly true of the ancient relatives of our club mosses and\r\nhorsetails.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most obvious questions to ask about these plants is\r\nhow long ago they lived, and upon the answer to such a question depend\r\nmany others. What, for instance, is the position of the Carboniferous as\r\ncompared to what preceded it and came after? How old is the earth and\r\nwhen did life first appear on it? The evidence upon which such questions\r\nare answered comes from the estimates of physicists as to the age of the\r\nearth; from students of fossil animals and plants; from astronomers,\r\nfrom geologists and other students. A compromise of these different\r\nestimates, and one that has consequently been widely accepted, gives the\r\nage of the earth, dating from the time of its having a definite crust\r\nwith land and water masses, as somewhere near a hundred million years.\r\nSuch figures are beyond our comprehension and consequently mean almost\r\nnothing, but the proportion in time of the different stages of the\r\ndevelopment of plants may be stated with greater certainty. Taking the\r\ntotal age of the earth as 100 per cent, the period when there is no\r\nrecord of life of any sort may be set down as about 45 per cent of the\r\ntotal, the reign of algæ and development of land plants about 8 per\r\ncent, the carboniferous or coal-forming plants about 28 per cent, which\r\nleaves only 19 per cent from that distant time to the present. And many\r\nthings happened in this comparatively brief fifth of the plant world’s\r\nhistory, among them the origin of some plants that have come straight\r\ndown to us, without discoverable change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--GINKGO OR MAIDENHAIR TREE\r\n\r\n(_Ginkgo biloba_)\r\n\r\nFound in most fossil strata and in a practically unchanged condition\r\nfrom the upper part of the Carboniferous to the most recent fossil\r\nrecords. Now unknown as a wild tree and preserved for us through its\r\ncultivation in ancient temple gardens in eastern Asia.]\r\n\r\nWe could hardly leave the Carboniferous time without at least brief\r\nmention of the ginkgo tree (Figure 109), or, as some call it, the\r\nmaidenhair tree. From the upper strata of the Carboniferous it is\r\ncommon, as it is in practically all subsequent fossil accumulations down\r\nto the most recent. And yet the tree has never been found wild, although\r\nits frequency in temple gardens in China and Japan, always as a\r\ncultivated tree, suggests that its disappearance as a wild plant must\r\nhave come since the priests began preserving it, which can be only a\r\nmatter of a few thousand years at most. In other words, we have just\r\nmissed seeing in the ginkgo what has so many times happened to these\r\nvery ancient types of vegetation, namely, their final extinction. This\r\nmust have occurred within historic times, and, judging by its frequent\r\nuse as a temple tree in eastern Asia, that region was its last outpost\r\nafter its long journey from the dim past. Thousands of other ancient\r\nplants have completely disappeared, and one cycad from New South Wales\r\nis at this moment putting up a losing fight against modern competitors,\r\nbut in the ginkgo tree the actual twilight and extinction of its wild\r\nexistence has missed observations by modern plant geographers by only a\r\nbrief period. It is almost as though we had waited all our life to see\r\nsome great event and then missed it by a few moments. Fortunately the\r\ntree is now common in cultivation, and not the least interesting feature\r\nof it is the fact that its male fertilizing cell retains its power of\r\nmovement, which dates back to its early associates. Among modern\r\nflowering plants only the ginkgo and the relatives of the sago palm or\r\ncycads retain this relic of an overwhelmingly cryptogamous ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe end of the Carboniferous or coal-forming ages was marked by great\r\nchanges in the earth’s surface, some of them cataclysmic in their\r\neffects. What they were in detail is described in the volume on geology\r\nand need not be repeated here. What happened to the development of the\r\nplant kingdom after this will be considered in the next section of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. MORE RECENT ANCESTORS OF OUR MODERN FLORA\r\n\r\nThe vegetation at the ending of Carboniferous times was much affected by\r\nthe great changes in the earth’s surface which happened then. The\r\nthrusting up of great mountain chains, the slow encroachment of\r\ncontinental glaciers, and the other phenomena characterizing that period\r\ncould not but be reflected in the plant population. For one thing the\r\ngiant club mosses and horsetails were much reduced in extent and finally\r\ndisappeared, leaving only the immediate ancestors of our present-day\r\nforms. _Cordaitales_ gave place to trees not unlike some of the modern\r\nyew trees. True ferns as well as the cycadlike ferns with seeds appear\r\nto have lived side by side with true cycads, which subsequently\r\nsupplanted their obvious cycadlike fern ancestors. There was an obvious\r\ndwindling of ancient Carboniferous forms, some of which, however,\r\npersisted in considerable numbers. Many other plants existed then, some\r\nof which died out there, and some of which still survive in descendants,\r\nparticularly among our conifers and ferns. But there happened toward the\r\nupper end of this period an event in the history of the plant kingdom so\r\ndramatic, of such far-reaching results, that its appearance might be\r\nlikened to the overthrow of the Czar in Russian history or to the\r\ndownfall of the Kaiser in Germany. For with it dawned a new era for the\r\nplant world, the effects of which we see all about us to-day.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the rock strata of this period we find the first\r\nangiosperm, or plant that matures its seed in a closed ovary, and with\r\nthe origin of that habit there began such a development of plants of\r\nthis type that its impetus has not yet been lost. It is impossible to\r\ntell at this distance from the origin of that first angiosperm from what\r\nit developed, nor how many ages it may have existed before the accident\r\nof its preservation as a fossil revealed its presence. It is certainly\r\nnot without significance that it bore conelike fruits, such as all its\r\nassociates and predecessors among flowering plants had done, but its\r\npossession of large, showy petals is the first evidence of a flower\r\ncharacteristic that was destined to make our present vegetation the\r\nlovely thing it is. This exceedingly interesting plant was a _Magnolia_\r\n(Figure 110), or so like our present plants of that genus as to be their\r\nobvious ancestor. Somewhere here, too, must have arisen the insect\r\nfertilization of flowers which we have seen to be such an important part\r\nof flower economy at the present time. Most of this ancient magnolia’s\r\nassociates must have relied on wind pollination for seed production, as\r\nmany modern plants still do, but the origin of insect fertilization\r\nappears to have come with the appearance of the first really\r\npetaliferous flower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--COMMON LAUREL MAGNOLIA\r\n\r\n(_Magnolia virginiana_)\r\n\r\nThe fossil record tells us that probably the first flowering plant was\r\nsome ancestor of magnolia.]\r\n\r\nWith this _Magnolia_ were found other flowering plants which soon\r\nincreased tremendously in numbers of individuals and differences of\r\nstructure, such as our sassafras, the tulip tree, the poplar tree, and\r\nsome others. All of these are trees or shrubs and we do not yet know\r\nwhether herbs grew in the strange surroundings of that ancient forest or\r\nnot. Their soft tissue may have prevented their preservation as fossils,\r\nbut, at any rate, no herb has left its rock-written record from as early\r\nin this period as the trees and shrubs. All of these ancient trees have\r\nbeen recorded only in the northern hemisphere and it may be true that\r\nthis part of the earth was the cradle of all those hosts of the\r\nflowering plants that now number over 150,000 species.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a mighty struggle for occupancy of the really\r\ndesirable plant sites soon after the rise of these immediate ancestors\r\nof our modern plants. For there is every evidence of the progressive\r\ndwindling of those still more ancient holdovers from the Carboniferous,\r\nand the steady encroachment of the newly arisen and obviously vigorous\r\nyoung race. As we get higher up in the strata, or, in other words,\r\nnearer to the present, there are literally thousands of these immediate\r\nancestors of our modern flora, and it is not very long before herbs,\r\nparticularly grasses and sedges, begin to be common, together with other\r\nmonocotyledonous plants such as palms. One not unlike our coconut palm\r\nhas been found in some of these strata in France.\r\n\r\nWhile this period records the origin of hundreds, and there are probably\r\nthousands of unrecorded species which are very near our modern\r\ndescendants of them, it was also a period when the earth’s crust was in\r\nan almost constant state of restlessness. Ice periods, huge inland seas,\r\ngreat volcanic upheavals, and the thrusting up of mountain chains such\r\nas the Alps, Himalayas, and some others, were only a few of the\r\ndisturbances to the orderly procession of this wholly new type of\r\nvegetation that doomed the older kinds and subsequently conquered the\r\nworld. The spread of this new element in the plant kingdom was greatly\r\nhelped and sometimes greatly hindered by land connections between\r\ncontinents, now separated by the oceans. The giant redwoods, now\r\nisolated in a few localities on our Pacific Coast, were found then\r\nnearly throughout the world. Because of these changes of land areas and\r\nsome others of even greater influence on plant growth, such as climate,\r\nthere was a constant shuffling of floral and, of course, animal\r\nelements, so that by the end of this period the new type of flora had\r\nspread throughout the world, but with here and there very local\r\noccurrence of certain genera and families, some of which have persisted\r\nto the present day. As we shall see in the last chapter of this book,\r\ncertain whole families are confined to restricted areas; the cactus and\r\npineapple family, and the genus _Helianthus_, or sunflowers, for\r\ninstance, are, with one or two trifling exceptions, wholly American. And\r\nwe have already seen how many food and other useful plants were first\r\nfound here by the Spaniards--chocolate, tobacco, corn, the potato, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt would fill the rest of this book to enumerate the plants that\r\nflourished toward the end of this period, and, in fact, it might almost\r\nbe said that the flora of those days was not very different from our\r\nown, only it was distributed in different ways and mixed in very\r\ndifferent proportions. With the disappearance or partial dwindling of\r\nmore ancient groups, the rise of the plants that immediately preceded\r\nour own ushered in a new era in the history of the plant kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSIL AND LIVING ALGÆ COMPARED.

(_Courtesy of Brooklyn Botanic\r\nGarden._)]\r\n\r\nAt the end of this period an event of commanding interest occurred,\r\nbecause it happened only some 40,000 years ago. With it came the\r\nencroachment from the north and south poles of the last of the great\r\ncontinental glaciers. There had been many before, stretching over a past\r\nperiod of time, but as the last of these great ice invasions it is the\r\nmost interesting to us. It crowded all these temperate and even\r\nsubtropical plants that then grew up in the far north toward the\r\nequator, and scraped clear of vegetation every part of the earth which\r\nit covered. In the volume on geology you will find an account of the\r\nextent and thickness of this great ice sheet, which ultimately receded\r\nto its present home. As it went back the plants crowded forward to\r\noccupy the freshly released land, the far northern or glacial first,\r\nfollowed by waves of other kinds. Some of the glacial or northern plants\r\nwere left on the tops of the highest mountains, where to-day they\r\npersist in complete isolation, nearly all their friends and associates\r\nof that greatest of all winters having left them for points farther\r\nnorth. Many students of plant geography think that wave of plant life\r\ncreeping northward to occupy the region uncovered by the retreating ice\r\nis still going on, and recent studies appear to show in at least one\r\nisolated mountain in the Adirondacks that the survivals of the ice age\r\nwhich have been isolated on its rocky peak ever since are in\r\nconsiderable danger of being crowded out by invaders from the lowlands.\r\n\r\nNot all the geological changes which have remodeled the earth’s surface\r\nhave been mentioned in this brief history of those plants that preceded\r\nour own, nor have anything like all the plants occurring in the\r\ndifferent strata been even hinted at. But the thing which has been\r\nstressed and for us to fix in our minds is that all our present\r\nvegetation literally has its roots deep down in the earth. Some, as\r\n_Lycopodium Selago_, go back no one knows how many millions of years;\r\nothers, like the flowering herbs, are much more recent. We come to\r\nunderstand how recent we are and what a comparatively brief flash in the\r\npan all our modern development both of plants and in man has been since\r\nthe last glacial period only by looking for a moment at what has\r\nhappened in the past. In the account of the Carboniferous plants we\r\nfound that there remained after that period only about 19 per cent of\r\nthe earth’s age in which all the changes since then could have come\r\nabout. If, as may well be possible, this period has been about\r\n19,000,000 years, then the mere 40,000 years since the last Ice Age\r\nseems a brief period indeed. As some one has written, to contrast all\r\nman’s historic period, back to the days of the most ancient Chinese\r\nmanuscript, with that long journey from the dim past which the plant\r\nworld has slowly accomplished, is to realize that we are “as the\r\nflashing of a meteor through the sea of night.”\r\n\r\nFossil plants then, and this delving into the dead past of the plant\r\nworld, reveals to us as nothing else can how much the modern plant\r\nkingdom is literally built upon a mighty race of ancestors. Some\r\nperished as did the _Cordaitales_, but left descendants who themselves\r\ngave rise to other groups that survive to-day. To look over a list of\r\nthe fossil plant genera of the different strata is to visualize a drama\r\nthe like of which no one living will ever see replayed, the results of\r\nwhich are recorded all over the world with its changing panorama of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. PRESENT-DAY PLANTS AND WHERE THEY COME FROM\r\n\r\nThere are living to-day somewhere about 150,000 species of flowering\r\nplants; half a hundred conifers or gymnosperms; about 3,500 ferns; 500\r\nclub mosses; over 70,000 bacteria, fungi, and lichens, and probably over\r\n20,000 species of algæ. The estimates of the last three divisions are\r\nmore or less uncertain, as many species are still being discovered.\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been read regarding the plants of earlier periods it\r\nis at once clear how completely the flowering plants have conquered all\r\ntheir ancient forbears, and what a pitifully small remnant of once proud\r\nand ancient forests are now represented by our club mosses and\r\nhorsetails. That process of crowding, of the dominance of one kind to\r\nthe exclusion or even extinction of others is still going on, and, as we\r\nshall see in the last chapter, often on a great scale.\r\n\r\nIf the period just after plants were first known on the earth may be\r\ncalled the Reign of Algæ, and subsequent periods were typified by still\r\nother kinds of plants, then our present period is _par excellence_ the\r\nreign of flowering plants. In numbers of individuals they are still far\r\noutclassed by such cryptogams as the fungi, bacteria, algæ, etc., but\r\ntheir dominating influence in the plant world is unquestioned.\r\n\r\nWhile all our present vegetation must have been derived from preexisting\r\ntypes, all of it is not necessarily directly descended from species\r\nwhich from their fossil records we know to have existed in geological\r\nperiods older than our own. While the fossil record of the times\r\nimmediately preceding the last ice age is a much more complete one than\r\nfor many other periods, it fails to account directly for the great bulk\r\nof our varied flora of to-day. While ferns in great variety,\r\ngymnosperms, and hundreds of flowering plants are known quite\r\ndefinitely, they total only a minute fraction of these groups to-day.\r\nEven granting the always imperfect nature of the fossil record, and we\r\nhave seen what an accident the formation of a plant fossil may be, and\r\nit is common knowledge how few comparatively have ever been\r\nrecovered--even granting all this, there still remains a large part of\r\nour present flora of which the origin probably dates from comparatively\r\nrecent times. So overwhelmingly true is this that of the Compositæ, or\r\ndaisy, family, now numbering over 11,000 species, scarcely a handful of\r\nfossil species have been found. And in all collections of fossils the\r\nwoody plants far outnumber the herbs, perhaps because of the greater\r\nprobability of their being thus preserved rather than to any actual\r\nscarcity of herbs in the upper strata. And yet herbs to-day outnumber\r\nwoody species over two to one. While it is true, then, that our present\r\nflora must have been derived from preexisting races, it is also true\r\nthat much of it is apparently derived from plants that do not date very\r\nfar back into the past. A few main _types_ of flowering plants\r\nunquestionably are to be linked with fossil genera, but these types have\r\nnow branched out into a wealth of detail that may not have existed and\r\nis certainly not recorded in the fossil record.\r\n\r\nSome of these types stand out with remarkable clearness, notably\r\nmagnolia, willows, poplars, walnuts, birches, oaks, figs, sassafras and\r\nits relatives, the rosales, the pea family, the spurges, maples, grapes,\r\nlinden, myrtle, ginseng, and some others. All these, and in not very\r\ndifferent aspect from their modern representatives, have been found in\r\nthe fossils of the different and usually more recent strata before the\r\nlast Ice Age. But the total fossil record of even these well-known\r\ngenera is only a fraction of their modern development, and we are\r\nconstantly confronted with the apparent dilemma of accounting for a\r\npresent wealth of forms based upon an obvious poverty of ancestry. While\r\nthe whole race of flowering plants is certainly a new one, as such\r\nthings are reckoned fossilwise, there has been a fecundity in the origin\r\nof new species among these lusty upstarts that is simply amazing. How\r\nthat, in part at least, has been accomplished will be considered in the\r\nfinal section of this chapter. Not only among these present-day plants,\r\nbut all through the story of the development of the plant kingdom, we\r\nhave been reading and writing of the changes of form and structure, some\r\nof which have been of far-reaching consequences. It is clear enough that\r\nif new types of vegetation and different races of plants have come into\r\nbeing and so modified the complexion of the plant kingdom, those changes\r\nmust have first arisen in individuals which had within them some\r\ncapacity for change, and furthermore the ability to use the change to\r\ntheir advantage. While, as we have seen, the losses have been\r\ntremendous, no one, with even this brief history of their development in\r\nmind, can doubt that there has been progress toward our present\r\nperfection of plant life.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. HOW PLANTS CHANGE THEIR CHARACTERS AND BECOME NEW SPECIES\r\n\r\nIt was with something very different in mind than the changing of plant\r\ncharacters that Cardinal Newman once said: “To live is to change, and to\r\nbe perfect is to change often.” And yet nothing better expresses the\r\nfacts of plants’ ability to change and the results of it than this reply\r\nof a great churchman to critics who could not or would not understand\r\nthe truth of his now famous reply.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps best to begin any discussion of the changes in plants by\r\nremembering a few simple facts regarding changes in ourselves. “Like\r\nfather like son” is something more than an old saw which we repeat for\r\ncenturies without stopping to think whether it is true or only half\r\ntrue. As with so many speeches of the sort, this is just precisely a\r\nhalf truth, for while sons are more apt to be like their fathers than\r\nother men, we all have within us the capacity, whether expressed or not,\r\nto change very considerably. In other words, all living things may be\r\nsaid to be a reflection or, perhaps better, the result of two divergent\r\ntendencies, one of which tends to make like produce like, and the other\r\nto produce something different.\r\n\r\nUpon the ability of like to produce like rests the continuity of those\r\nplant groups, well exemplified by _Lycopodium Selago_ and the ginkgo,\r\nwhich, through all the changing panorama of the history of the plant\r\nworld, have steadily produced individuals so close to the ancestral type\r\nas to be essentially indistinguishable from it. It is upon the\r\npossession of this ability that all the different races of plants depend\r\nfor the unchanged perpetuation of their kind. And, as we shall presently\r\nsee, it is also upon this very ability that the new forms that do arise,\r\nrely for holding fast to their differences.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true, then, that like tends to produce like, it is also and\r\nperhaps even more true that they do not precisely do so. In fact, they\r\nnever do absolutely, and it is the degree of divergence from the type\r\nthat different plants or animals exhibit, which is the measure of their\r\nability to vary, or “produce something different.” Upon this capacity to\r\nvary, from whatever cause, rest all the changes which have occurred in\r\nthe plant world, and, as we have seen in previous chapters, that has\r\nbeen by no means an insignificant affair. We know, in fact, that while\r\none plant of _Lycopodium Selago_, than which scarcely any other now\r\nliving has had greater opportunity to become fixed in its characters, is\r\nmuch like another, no two of them are actually identical. Nor are any\r\ntwo plants of the same species ever precisely alike, any more than two\r\nchildren, even of the same parents, are. The tendency for like to\r\nproduce like is matched then, or sometimes exceeded, by an almost\r\nequally strong tendency to vary.\r\n\r\nHeredity on the one hand and variation on the other are the two forces\r\nupon which the origin of new species or kinds of plants is based. Both\r\nof these work in rather definite ways, some of which are fairly well\r\nunderstood, but many of which are still among the things that scientists\r\nare striving to clear up. As the capacity to inherit characters from one\r\ngeneration to another reflects itself in the generally stable conditions\r\nwhich the plant world exhibits, while the capacity to vary is the only\r\nsource of new forms, it is quite naturally the variations of plants from\r\none generation to another which have been most studied. And the study of\r\nvariation in plants is not the simple thing we might assume it to be,\r\nhaving in mind only the well-known fact that no two organisms are\r\nexactly alike. Wherein do they differ? Are their perhaps temporary or\r\neven quite casual differences passed on to their progeny? These and\r\nmany other questions about variation make it at once the most\r\ncomplicated and often one of the most fruitful subjects of plant\r\nresearch. It is clear enough that with the bewildering variety of\r\ndifferent plants in nature it is next to impossible not only to record\r\naccurately the amount of variation or its probability of being handed\r\non, but least of all to arrive at any clue as to the origin of that\r\nvariation. Because of this, and still more because practically no one\r\nhas ever seen the actual origin of a new species in nature, for we only\r\nsee the finished product, practically all our knowledge of the laws of\r\nvariation has been derived from studying cultivated plants. The ease of\r\ncontrolling them and of recording thousands of observations of their\r\ncharacteristics has made the work of the plant breeder, and others who\r\nstudy variation in the vegetable world, much more of an exact science\r\nto-day than the mass of often interesting but usually unrelated data\r\nthat crowd the pages of older botanical literature.\r\n\r\nOne of the main facts about variation is that it is itself a very\r\nvariable thing, and the nature of those “fluctuating variations” which\r\nare so common in nature well illustrate the point. Within what we know\r\nas a species there are many individuals that vary one way or the other\r\nfrom a fairly central, we might almost call them normal, mass of\r\nindividuals which are typical of that species. Nearly all these forms on\r\nthe fringe of the species due to the environmental changes and not to\r\nchanges of hereditary constitution will, if left to themselves, tend\r\nthrough their progeny to become more like the central mass as time goes\r\non, while their position, or some other equally nontypical edge of the\r\nfringe, will be taken up by other variants from the average conditions.\r\nThe amount of this fluctuating variability among plants is beyond\r\ncalculation, and its action has often been likened to the swinging of a\r\npendulum, which of course spends twice the time passing through the\r\ncenter of its arc, that it does on the limits of it. This very nearly\r\nexpresses the proportion of fluctuating variants to the mass of typical\r\nindividuals in many species of plants. In many others, often peculiarly\r\nunstable species, the number of individuals at the fringe is very large\r\nindeed. Sometimes there may be one or more that do hold their\r\ncharacteristics, in which case we know that they are not true\r\nenvironmental variations but have actually a different constitution.\r\nThese will be considered presently under another and different sort of\r\nvariability. But, speaking generally, these fluctuating or environmental\r\nvariants are merely forms of the species, and, other things being equal,\r\nthey will not actually originate new species.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized here, and before we go further in our discussion\r\nof variation, that species and varieties are after all largely creations\r\nof the mind of man rather than the reflection of actuality in nature.\r\nWhen we speak of a “species” it is merely a term which through usage by\r\nbotanists becomes the symbol of a group of plants more like one another\r\nthan like anything else. It is obvious that it is therefore necessarily\r\nan inaccurate designation of the actual conditions found among plants,\r\nwhich might almost be considered as all belonging to one great group of\r\nwhich, for our convenience in referring to them, we mark off units\r\n(families, genera, species, etc.), much as units are marked off on a\r\nrule. Species, then, and varieties of plants, notwithstanding the\r\nutmost refinement of method used in designating and describing them, and\r\nthis is historically the most ancient and the most widely developed\r\nphase of botanical science, cannot reflect the true conditions, and for\r\na number of reasons. The chief one is that species differ in usually\r\nseveral characters one from another and in large genera there is often a\r\nbewildering recombination of characters of the genus in the species\r\nbelonging to it. Species and varieties are concepts of convenience, nay\r\nof absolute necessity, in talking or writing about plants, but hardly\r\nexpressions of exact truth.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind we can appreciate the position of those plant breeders\r\nwho insist that the basis of differences in all plants are the simplest,\r\nso-called, factor expressions, which can be isolated and studied with\r\nsome approach to exactitude in experimental cultures. A factor may be\r\ndefined as the hereditary determiner or base, which, either singly or in\r\nconjunction with other factors, is expressed as a character, such as\r\ntallness in peas, or brown eyes in human beings. Such studies have built\r\nup a body of information about variation in plants that show it to be of\r\nseveral kinds and with different chances of being passed on from one\r\ngeneration to another.\r\n\r\nIt was noted in the paragraph before the last that fluctuating variants\r\nwere sometimes so far off the usual that they might almost be considered\r\ndistinct forms or varieties. Many such changes appear to be the result\r\nof different conditions of the local environment, due to changed\r\nconditions rather than to any internal difference in the constitution of\r\nthe plant itself. A familiar illustration of environmental variation\r\nmay be seen in lima beans. In any considerable number of plants one\r\noften finds smaller and larger pods, either sparsely or well filled with\r\nbeans. If the beans from the small-podded, few-seeded variants are\r\nplanted they will produce, apparently quite indiscriminately, large and\r\nsmall podded progeny, just as there will result a mixed progeny if only\r\nbeans from the well-filled and large-podded kind are sown. In other\r\nwords the plant fluctuates about a general average which typifies the\r\nusual or mass characteristics of the species. One should not, however,\r\nregard _all_ variations of the character in lima beans, or any other\r\nplant as environmental or fluctuating ones, for some of them may be due\r\nto differences in hereditary constitution. And these could only be\r\ndetermined by breeding tests.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental variations are as frequent as the ever-changing conditions\r\nof plant growth may determine, and it is common knowledge that such\r\ndiversity of the environment and the variants resulting from it are\r\nextremely frequent.\r\n\r\nA much more fruitful source of new forms of plant life results from\r\nnatural cross-fertilization, which, as we saw in an earlier chapter, is\r\nthe nearly universal condition in the plant world. If species and\r\nvarieties can be distinguished only by factor differences, as the plant\r\nbreeders no doubt correctly insist, it becomes obvious enough that we\r\nhave in cross-fertilization to consider not alone the factor differences\r\nof the pistillate or female, but also of the staminate or male\r\ncontribution to the union, and how these are reflected in the progeny.\r\nOur knowledge of this has practically all been based on work done on\r\ncultivated plants under control conditions and it shows some\r\ninteresting developments which occur from crossing.\r\n\r\nIf garden peas with, let us say, reddish-purple flowers are crossed with\r\nwhite-flowered ones, the progeny will not be a mixture of these colors\r\nbut all reddish-purple. If all danger of subsequent cross-fertilization\r\nis excluded this first generation of reddish-purple progeny will\r\nthemselves produce reddish-purple and white progeny in the ratio of\r\nthree to one. But the extraordinary part of it is that in the third\r\ngeneration all the white and about one-third of the reddish-purple\r\nplants will breed true to color. The balance of the reddish-purple\r\nplants, which comprise about two-thirds of the second generation, will,\r\nif their seeds are germinated, produce colored as against white-flowered\r\nprogeny in the three-to-one ratio. In other words, these artificial\r\ncrosses, made by the plant breeder, and this splitting up of hybrids\r\nwhich has been many times verified, are seen to be very fertile causes\r\nof the origin of new forms of plant life, if only the factor and\r\ncharacter differences in the ancestry be sufficiently complex. With no\r\ntwo plants precisely alike, with cross-fertilization so nearly\r\nuniversal, and with all characters, not a single character or factor\r\nexpression, as in control conditions likely to be affected by the cross,\r\nit may be seen how fruitful a source of new forms this natural crossing\r\nmay be. It is, in fact, not surprising that plants vary, but that the\r\nforce of heredity will hold them into such recognizable categories that\r\nthe red maple, or white ash, or blue cohosh are, with thousands of other\r\nspecies, after all fairly definite designations without which talking\r\nand writing about plants would be all but impossible. Some of our most\r\nbeautiful garden plants have arisen either as the result of natural\r\ncrossing, or crosses deliberately made by the plant breeder. The scores\r\nof forms of the common garden lilac have mostly come about by such\r\ncrosses, although many other garden plants have arisen by still another\r\nkind of variability.\r\n\r\nThe effects of crossing which have been so briefly noted were not\r\nunderstood, as indeed the cause of them is still unknown, before 1865,\r\nwhen Gregor Mendel, an Augustinian monk, published the results of his\r\nwork on peas, which furnished the basis for all subsequent work on this\r\nkind of variability. His work was neglected until 1900, when what is now\r\nknown as Mendel’s law, involving the Mendelian ratio already noted, was\r\nrediscovered by three independent workers. It is now practically\r\nuniversally accepted as the way in which natural or induced hybrids\r\ntransmit their characters.\r\n\r\nThere remains still another type of variability which has been noticed\r\nfrom very early days, and received the name _sport_, because quite\r\nsuddenly, from a crop of otherwise similar specimens, one or a few\r\nplants showed marked and permanently transmitted differences from the\r\naverage condition. Such sudden offshoots, which occur rather frequently\r\nin many plants, are known as mutants, the process as mutation. Hugo de\r\nVries, a Dutch botanist of world-wide fame, was the chief modern figure\r\nwho drew attention to mutants, and explained how they differ from\r\nfluctuating variants in that while these tend to revert to the average\r\nor mass conditions the mutant, once it appeared, held true to type. A\r\nwell-known example of mutation is the cabbage, brussels sprouts,\r\ncauliflower, and kohl-rabi, all of which are sports or mutants from a\r\nweedy seaside plant of the mustard family, native in Europe. Since\r\ntheir appearance, hundreds of years ago, they have held their essential\r\ncharacters. If they had been environmental variants they would in all\r\nprobability have reverted to their weedy ancestor. Hundreds of sports or\r\nmutants have been recognized and isolated, so that many of our most\r\nvaluable garden plants have arisen through this ability of plants to\r\nvary in often sudden and rather startling degree. The gardener and\r\nhorticulturist, from long observation and a keen sight for valuable\r\nnovelties, have always known that sports are fruitful sources of new\r\nforms of plants, but De Vries first scientifically studied them and\r\nworked out the principles by which they apparently react. The cause of\r\nthem is still unknown.\r\n\r\nWhile the cause of mutants has not yet been revealed, we have already\r\nseen that the two remaining kinds of variability are due to changes in\r\nthe environment, or to crossing. Charles Darwin when he published his\r\n“Origin of Species,” than which no other book has so completely\r\nrevolutionized modern thought, did not state the cause of those\r\nvariations of which he was our greatest observer. He did state the now\r\nuniversally accepted law of the “Survival of the Fittest” which explains\r\nhow, once these variations make their appearance, the inexorable\r\nconflict of nature would automatically weed out the unfit. We have seen\r\nall through the course of this history of the plant kingdom how whole\r\ntypes of vegetation have been overthrown to give way to other types\r\nbetter fitted to survive. That process is going on with just as\r\ninexorable results to-day as it has down through the ages. While Darwin\r\nnever claimed that such a purely selective process could initiate new\r\nspecies, many of his partisans who waged battle for him during the first\r\nyears of the tremendous opposition his views encountered, did so claim,\r\nand probably wrongly. The actual cause of the origin of new species,\r\nexcept those demonstrated to result from new combinations of already\r\nknown characters, through crossing, cannot be explained through the\r\nnatural selection of plants or animals which exhibit favorable\r\nvariations. We see their effects; it is obvious enough, that those of\r\nvalue tend for the survival of plants having such variations, and it was\r\nnatural enough that older students of the problem should mistake these\r\neffects for the cause of them. The process of selective elimination\r\nconstantly going on does tend to fix certain favorable variations and\r\nuntold millions of plants have had their day in the past due to their\r\npossession of such, and the killing off of their less fortunately\r\nprovided associates. We speak of this great march from the simplest\r\norganism up to our most complex plants and animals as their evolution,\r\nbut we must never forget that it has gone step by step, by one or the\r\nother methods by which we have seen that plants vary, or perchance by\r\nsome undetected method, and that while the results of it are for all to\r\nsee, the causes of that infinitely slow and quite often wayward\r\nvariation are not understood. Upon such a conception our modern plant\r\nlife is seen to be a development of plants that have gone before, that\r\nall existing life is derived from preexisting, and not from providential\r\ninterposition or special creations. All through the long marches of\r\nplant evolution there appears to be a definite and final goal toward\r\nwhich it tends, but we do not know the direction, least of all the\r\nobject, of that goal. In fact, there may be many goals, just as there\r\nare the diversity of ambitions among human beings. In tracing the\r\npresent ascendancy of our flowering plants from their links with the\r\npast perhaps we shall find no better statement of their present\r\ncondition or destiny than to repeat Cardinal Newman’s reply: “To live is\r\nto change, and to be perfect is to change often.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the previous chapters how many and how varied are the\r\nactivities of the plant world and in this final one we shall get a\r\nglimpse of what these activities have produced. All the delicate\r\nmechanism of food getting and the manufacture of starch; the\r\nfertilization of flowers by insects, the wind or water; the response to\r\nchanging light and to climate--these and scores of other activities of\r\nplants have resulted in the present vegetation of the world being what\r\nit is. Here we see the final reflection or register of not one but all\r\nthe kaleidoscopic evidences of plant response and activities and history\r\nworking in harmony, or, as we shall see presently, sometimes in violent\r\nconflict, and leaving as the result the wonderfully varied vegetation\r\nthat now covers the earth. If we could read aright the story of which\r\nthe vegetation of any particular country is the silent narrator, it\r\nwould tell us not only what happened in the past but what is likely to\r\nhappen in the future.\r\n\r\nPlants, by what amounts to a kind of fatality, are rooted to the spot\r\nwhere they grow so that, unlike animals, their rapid distribution\r\nappears to be almost impossible, and yet the tremendous distances that\r\nsome species have traveled seem like a pretty successful protest against\r\nthe fact of the anchorage of individuals to the point of their origin.\r\nIt is more than a successful protest, for it amounts in many species to\r\nan active campaign for dominance, to the exclusion or extinction of less\r\naggressive neighbors, so that in any field or meadow or forest there are\r\nsilent struggles constantly going on. Some of these are so inexorable in\r\ntheir results that they change not only the frequency of occurrence of\r\nthe individuals involved, but sometimes the whole type of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe competition to occupy just as much of the favorable plant sites as\r\npossible has been much aided by many species possessing means for the\r\ndispersal of their seeds or fruits that are ingenious in the extreme.\r\nSome of these are written plainly enough in the structure of the seed\r\nand its wonderful adaptability for the peculiar conditions to which it\r\nwill be subjected. Before considering some of these structures we may\r\nprofitably see how some plants look after the dispersal of their seeds\r\nwithin their own limited sphere of action.\r\n\r\nIn hundreds of plants the ripened pods, instead of being erect as their\r\nflowers have been, are pointed downward about the time the seeds are\r\nready to be released, and their harvest is sown, sometimes by deliberate\r\nmovements, in the immediate vicinity. No great areas are captured by\r\nsuch plants, except by the slow process of successive generations\r\nextending their range a few inches or at most a few feet a year. The\r\ngreat bulk of all seeds never do grow into new plants, but in those that\r\nonly shed their seeds close to the parent plant the opportunity to reach\r\nnew sites is by that much restricted. The chance of the species getting\r\nvery far afield except by slow invasion of the neighboring region is\r\nlimited. A few of such plants show remarkable ingenuity in reaching the\r\nutmost distance possible, perhaps the most effective cases being those\r\nthat shoot their seeds by explosive bursting of their pods. Nearly all\r\nthe violets do this, often shooting seeds several feet from the parent\r\nplant. Many plants of the pea family have pods that are twisted, which\r\nupon splitting release the previously pinched seeds so suddenly that\r\nthey are shot considerable distances. In the common witch-hazel (Figure\r\n111), the seed is shot through the air often as much as thirty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--THE WITCH-HAZEL\r\n\r\n(_Hamamelis virginiana_)\r\n\r\nIs a fall or winter flowering plant which shoots its seed sometimes as\r\nmuch as thirty feet. Native of eastern North America.]\r\n\r\nBut with even the greatest ingenuity and the most explosive bursting of\r\npods, most plants could never capture much new ground, and their very\r\nexistence as a species is often contingent on their ability to spread,\r\nif these various methods by which plants shed their seeds were not aided\r\nby outside help. Some of these have had conspicuous and almost startling\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DISPERSAL BY ANIMALS, THE WIND, AND WATER\r\n\r\nThe seeds or fruits of those plants that are used for animal food are\r\noften carried considerable distances, while the thrifty squirrels’\r\nburying of acorns is everyday knowledge to those who have seen them\r\nbusily engaged in the making of winter stores, or the planting of new\r\ntrees, often many rods from the parent tree. In years of plentiful seed\r\nproduction squirrels have been known to plant great quantities of seeds\r\nof the Douglas fir, thereby hastening the establishment of one of the\r\ngreatest evergreen forests in the west.\r\n\r\nWhile some seeds are destroyed by passing through the digestive tract of\r\nanimals many are not harmed in the least. From over two hundred and\r\nfifty different kinds of plant seeds fed to a variety of birds over 80\r\nper cent germinated perfectly after passing through their digestive\r\ntracts. And perhaps the most remarkable case is the seed of a pondweed\r\nsaid to be incapable of germination until it has passed through a bird.\r\nThis plant grows in fresh water ponds in great quantities and is much\r\neaten by wild ducks. From the stomach of one bird over three hundred\r\nsuch seeds were recovered. In the Eastern States a common feature of our\r\nfarms is the red cedar or juniper scattered along fence rows, nearly all\r\nof which are due to birds roosting on fence rails and dropping the seeds\r\nafter passage through their digestive tract.\r\n\r\nWe get some idea of the part birds play in plant dispersal when we\r\nrealize the enormous number of them that make their flights twice a\r\nyear, often over great distances. Wild ducks, in untold millions, travel\r\nfrom the far north to the tropics, each carrying their freight of\r\nseeds, sometimes as food and often mechanically clinging to their feet.\r\nThe writer once saw at Gardiner’s Island and Montauk, Long Island,\r\nhundreds of thousands of tree swallows which feed on the fruits of the\r\nbayberry (_Myrica carolinensis_). So dense was the flock that they\r\ncovered nearly every inch of the bayberry patches, and after eating no\r\none can calculate how many million seeds they started off toward their\r\nwinter home. Stopping as they do each day on their long flight\r\nsouthward, is it any wonder that the bayberry is one of the commonest\r\nbushes along the Atlantic coast?\r\n\r\nWith flights of birds stretching from the Arctic to the Antarctic,\r\nsometimes a single species making such a flight during its migration\r\nperiod, and hundreds of species making shorter flights twice a season,\r\nit is easily seen how birds can carry seeds for long distances. That\r\nthey do so carry them is common knowledge and in eleven wild ducks\r\nexamined by H. B. Guppy, he found nearly 300 seeds of bur reed,\r\nforty-one of pondweed, 270 sedges and 222 seeds that he could not\r\nidentify. Nearly all these seeds germinated when sown, some sprouting\r\nmore quickly than if they had not passed through the bird’s stomach.\r\nSome few seeds which would usually be dormant for one, two or even three\r\nyears, have their germination unquestionably hastened by passage through\r\nbirds, who may be looked on in some cases at least as “flying\r\ngerminators.”\r\n\r\nSome sea-flying birds have been captured over five hundred miles from\r\nland and seeds of a buttercup and of the sea blite recovered from their\r\nstomachs. One student of the flora of Spitzbergen has stated that nearly\r\nall the plants of that cold region have come from the northern part of\r\nthe Scandinavian peninsula through their carriage by birds. One of the\r\ncommonest plants of that region is the crowberry, which is a favorite\r\nfood of birds. The plant is found throughout the Arctic regions and on\r\nhigh mountain tops to the south of it, such as the Alps, our own\r\nAdirondacks and White Mountains, and many others. There are some islands\r\nin the Pacific known to have received a few of the plants now growing on\r\nthem by birds carrying the seeds from other regions, often thousands of\r\nmiles away. Several species of birds are known to make sustained oversea\r\nflights from Labrador to South America, and one from Alaska to Hawaii.\r\nIn such flights stopping is impossible, so that the carrying of fresh\r\nseeds and spores is always likely and probably more quickly accomplished\r\nthan by any other means of transport. In New Zealand a northern European\r\nbird was once found with the seeds of two species of marsh arrow grass\r\nin its stomach, both of which germinated. The plants are native in the\r\ncooler parts of the north temperate zone.\r\n\r\nNot far from New York, at Montauk Point, Long Island, there was found a\r\nfew years ago some plants of the cloudberry, a kind of blackberry with\r\namber-colored fruits, which is otherwise unknown in that region but is\r\ncommon enough in the Arctic and on mountain tops northward. That point\r\nof land, extending out to sea, is a favorite stopping place for\r\nmigrating birds and to them was undoubtedly due the introduction of the\r\nplant so far south of its true home. Scores of similar cases could be\r\ncited which confirm the observations of naturalists all over the world\r\nthat birds are among the greatest aids to plants in securing wide\r\ndispersal. Of course the factors of favorable or unfavorable conditions,\r\nonce the seed is deposited in the new home, operate to keep plants from\r\nthe tropics from settling permanently in colder regions and _vice\r\nversa_, but we cannot escape the conclusion that the sky is filled\r\nduring certain seasons with millions of seed carriers that have, in many\r\ncases, populated their stopping places with foreign plants.\r\n\r\nOther animals than birds carry fruits and seeds, besides those that eat\r\nthem. Some fruits like the _Martynia_ (Figure 60), are so arranged that\r\nno animal with fur can avoid catching some if they come in contact. The\r\nprickly fruits of cocklebur resulted in one species of that weed from\r\nthe steppes of Russia being carried all over southern Europe in a\r\ncomparatively few years. Tickseeds, _Bidens_, and all the hosts of\r\nplants that have prickles, burs, spines or what not attached to their\r\nfruits, have, by the possession of such devices, a better chance for\r\ndispersal of their fruits than those not so provided. Others, again,\r\nhave various coatings of mucilage which stick to animals and thus help\r\nplants to overcome their chief drawback to dispersal--their anchorage at\r\nthe place of birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIND\r\n\r\nThe great trade winds, the violent hurricanes and monsoons of Asia, are\r\nall active and constant aids to plant dispersal. The fruits of many\r\nplants are provided with various devices to insure buoyancy in the air,\r\nsuch as maple, ash, and most seeds of pines and their relatives,\r\nbirches, poplars, and willows, all of which may be carried distances of\r\na few hundred feet in ordinary winds. In the buttonball tree, the\r\nmilkweeds, fireweed, and many other plants there are feathery\r\nattachments or plumes that insure their seeds or fruits being carried\r\nvery long distances indeed in regular or violent winds. But in the daisy\r\nfamily or _Compositæ_ we find nearly all the eleven thousand species\r\nprovided with a plumelike attachment of their light fruits, familiar\r\nenough in the dandelion, which may explain their being more widely\r\ndistributed than any other plants. Some of them, however, are carried by\r\nanimals, as they produce, in certain genera, barbed or hooked achenes.\r\n\r\nThe whole seed of some plants is so small that it can be lifted bodily\r\nby the wind, for instance _Rhododendrons_ and many other heaths, one of\r\nthe hanging pitcher plants of tropical Asia, many orchid seeds, and of\r\nhundreds of other plants. Many of these are less than one ten-thousandth\r\nof a gram in weight and, with dust and the spores of nearly all\r\ncryptogams, may be transported thousands of miles. When it is recalled\r\nthat the dust from a volcanic eruption at Krakatoa in the Pacific was\r\npicked up on London window sills, and that some seeds and nearly all\r\nspores are as light as most dust, the wind as a plant dispersal agent\r\nbecomes significant. In the western part of the United States over 800\r\nmillion tons of dust are carried over 1,400 inches in a single year,\r\naccording to estimates by J. W. Evans in his article on “The Wearing\r\nDown of Rocks.” Some effects of wind dispersal of seeds and spores\r\nfurnish interesting data to the plant geographer.\r\n\r\nIn the Bahamas the natives speak of “hurricane grass” as a plant that\r\nwas unknown on Great Bahama Island before August 13, 1890, when there\r\nwas a great hurricane. Soon after this the sedge, which had been blown\r\nover from another island, began to be common on Great Bahama, where it\r\nis now thoroughly established. On Krakatoa near Java a violent eruption\r\nin 1883 completely destroyed the vegetation, covering the island with\r\nvolcanic material. In thirteen years over sixty species of plants had\r\narrived on the island, of which about twenty had been blown there as\r\nseeds or spores. Birds had carried about 7 per cent and the remainder\r\nhad come by other means. No plants with sticky burs or other devices for\r\ncatching in the coats of animals were found.\r\n\r\nIt is among the _Compositæ_ or daisy family that the wind is seen to\r\nwork most effectively as distributing agents of its light-plumed fruits.\r\nIn the Falkland Islands, St. Helena, and Prince’s Island, all from 300\r\nto 1,500 miles from the nearest land, species of _Senecio_ or groundsel\r\nhave been found that may well have been wind-driven onto these remote\r\nislands from the mainland. In fact the whole genus _Senecio_, consisting\r\nof over two thousand species, and of world-wide distribution, has in all\r\nprobability been spread largely by its wind-borne achenes. They are not\r\nedible, nor are they suited to carriage by the ocean currents, but some\r\nof them are known to stick in the plumage of birds.\r\n\r\nBut it is hardly necessary to cite these far-flung examples of the\r\nwind’s action in distributing seeds, for there are many interesting\r\ncases much closer home. The tumbleweeds, such as the false indigo and\r\ncertain grasses, are familiar sights scudding before the wind over\r\nprairies in the West and open places in the East. By a kind of foresight\r\nthe winged seeds of the pines are so weighted, due to lack of symmetry,\r\nthat instead of sailing quickly to the ground, they tumble and flutter\r\nabout, thus prolonging the time of flight. And in the linden the curious\r\nwinglike attachment from which the stalk of the fruit arises is\r\nadmirably fitted to slide over the snow and ice upon which, through\r\ntheir often tardy falling, they are deposited. Scores of such\r\nadaptations of structure to function are known, where there seems direct\r\nresponse to conditions and there is the temptation to say that such\r\nadaptations are caused by the wind or other agency. Nothing could be\r\nfarther from the truth, as plants do not produce winged seeds or\r\nluscious fruits to insure seed dispersal, but the seeds of plants having\r\nsuch devices, from whatever cause, are naturally favored in the\r\nceaseless struggle to occupy new land, which is quite another thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER\r\n\r\nThe scattering of seeds along streams is too common a process to need\r\nmore than a mere mention here, for it is to be seen along any fresh\r\nwater stream at harvest time. But seeds that may be carried by ocean\r\ncurrents have a much greater influence on the distribution of plants,\r\nsuch as the coconut palm, already mentioned among the food plants, and\r\nnow common throughout the tropical world.\r\n\r\nThe number of seeds that will float in sea water and still keep the\r\npower of germinating is not very great. Most seeds sink at once; many\r\nwill float for months, but are useless when they reach land; but those\r\nthat will both float and grow afterward have worked some curious changes\r\nin the floras of different islands. Sometimes the great ocean currents,\r\nlike the Gulf Stream, appear particularly futile in the fruits they\r\ncarry such long distances, as the pods of a tropical vine from the West\r\nIndies are not infrequently found on the coast of Norway and even of\r\nNova Zembla, of course uselessly. But many ocean currents, particularly\r\nin the Pacific, have carried fruits and seeds thousands of miles, they\r\nhave even carried so-called floating islands of vegetation bodily.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable case is that of _Entada scandens_, a\r\ntropical vine of the pea family, bearing large pods, sometimes several\r\nfeet long. The plant is not typically a seaside plant, and there is\r\nevidence that fruits matured in the shade of its usual forest home will\r\nnot float. Those that grow nearer the coast and more in the open\r\ndevelop, through partial drying, a small air chamber inside upon which\r\nthe seed depends for buoyancy. Its original home is apparently somewhere\r\nin Central America, from the west coast of which it spread over the\r\nPacific to the shores of the Indian Ocean. Over the Atlantic it has\r\nreached the shores of tropical Africa, and in fact wherever ocean\r\ncurrents cast up their refuse on lonely beaches parts of the giant pod\r\nor individual seeds of _Entada scandens_ are found. Partly fossilized\r\nremains of them have been taken from peat bogs along the coast of\r\nNorway, of course dating since glacial times, but showing by their\r\npresence there how long this water-borne seed of the pea family has been\r\nattempting to populate the earth. Of course all that do not reach tropic\r\nshores are lost, but nearly throughout the Pacific Islands, with some\r\nexceptions, the vine is now established. The extraordinary feature of it\r\nall is that scarcely half the seeds of the plant will float at all,\r\nnearly all inland forms sinking at once in the fresh water rivers into\r\nwhich they may chance to fall. Only those that grow near the sea, in\r\nmangrove swamps and the like, or at any rate near brackish water, will\r\nfloat. These, however, apparently float indefinitely without loss of\r\ngerminating power. There is abundant evidence that many plants of\r\noceanic islands have similar characteristics so far as their inland and\r\nseaside forms are concerned.\r\n\r\nWhile _Entada scandens_ has spread in spite of unfavorable adaptation\r\nfor seed floating, there are some plants whose seeds always float, and\r\nin spite of the sea water retain their power of germination. H. B.\r\nGuppy, from whom much of the above data are taken and who has\r\nexperimented for years on the buoyancy and germinating power of\r\nsea-borne seeds, reckons about two hundred species that may have spread\r\nby ocean currents. Many of these are nearly world-wide in their\r\ndistribution within their climatic requirements, and most are confined\r\nto the tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. INVASION, MIGRATION, AND RELICS\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a natural enough question why such elaborate and effective\r\nmethods of seed dispersal are necessary and why plants, once they grow\r\nin any particular locality are not satisfied to stay there. The answer\r\nto this is that individual and racial competition is so great that\r\nwithout means of dispersal, which may be looked on as equipment for\r\nseeking a more favorable site, species would often be crowded out.\r\n\r\nThere is no better place to see this than at the edge of a forest and\r\ngrassland. The presence of the forest tells us at once that what may be\r\ndescribed as the forest type of climate must have existed in the past to\r\nhave produced the woods. In clearing off parts of this forest the\r\nopenings will usually be grassland at first, but never in the end if\r\nnature is allowed to work out the solution. Along the edge of such a\r\nforest will be found a host of pioneers pushing out among the grasses,\r\nmaking ready, by conditions of shade, protection from drying winds and\r\nother influences, for the seedlings of the forest trees that creep\r\nslowly but resistlessly out to capture areas that by right of previous\r\noccupancy belong to them. In practically all parts of the world, with a\r\nfew local exceptions, wherever the forest was the original type there is\r\nthis ceaseless struggle to reclaim the open places, often or usually\r\npeopled by grass. It may be set down as almost a rule that if the open\r\nplaces produce herbs with broader leaves than grasses, the forest will\r\ncapture the area many years sooner than if grass alone is the temporary\r\ntenant. Grass by its exclusive growth, its complete monopolization, so\r\nfar as low seedlings are concerned, of much light and nearly all\r\navailable surface water, is singularly well able to take care of itself\r\nonce it is thoroughly established. But plotted and marked areas of this\r\ncontact between forest and artificial clearings in it, show that in the\r\nend the forest will win, often at the rate of five hundred feet in a\r\nhundred years, sometimes much quicker than this.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, what may be called the prairie type of climate\r\nhas resulted in the formation of grassland, which has happened in our\r\nown West, in the steppes of Russia and less extensively in many other\r\nplaces in the world, forests can hardly ever get a foothold. Where, as\r\nin river bottoms, they sometimes flourish, the line between forest and\r\ngrassland is sharp and apparently an impassable barrier for trees.\r\n\r\nThis invasion of immediately adjoining territory is going on constantly\r\nnot only by different types of vegetation but by the units of it. The\r\nfrequency of different plants in different years, their final ascendancy\r\nor extinction, all point to the struggle for expansion which in a score\r\nof ways the plant world is constantly waging. In many cases we are not\r\nyet able to see the struggle, but only its results, while in some places\r\nthe bitterness of it may be gauged by the dead and dying that strew\r\nthese silent battle fields.\r\n\r\nThe dominance of certain species of plants, such as grasses on a\r\nprairie, the fir and spruce in the coniferous forests of our North, the\r\nblue-gum trees in parts of Australia and the giant dipterocarp forests\r\nin the Philippines, are all based on the ability of individuals to\r\nspread from their point of origin. All species of plants must have one\r\nday been of very local distribution and confined to the region where\r\nthey were born, but from their often very modest beginnings some of them\r\nat any rate have gone to the ends of the earth. The common bracken fern\r\nis found in nearly every country in the world from far northward through\r\nthe tropics to the antipodes, and yet no one knows where its original\r\nhome might have been. Somewhere up in the northern Andes it is supposed\r\nthat the first ancestor of the huge daisy family had its origin. From\r\nthere its many descendants, now ramified into hundreds of genera and\r\nover eleven thousand species, have spread to the very limits of plant\r\ngrowth. And the daisy family is one of the most recent of all the\r\nfamilies of plants.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of plants is of many kinds depending on local\r\nconditions of climate and soil, on individual and racial competition, on\r\nmethods of fertilization or other means of propagation or seed\r\ndispersal, and particularly upon the distribution of the plant or its\r\nancestors in past ages. While it is often difficult or impossible to\r\ndetermine upon which of these factors, or upon what combination of them\r\nthe distribution of any particular species is based, certain facts of\r\nplant dispersal appear to be indicated by a study of existing floras. A\r\nfew instances must suffice here to illustrate the principles by which\r\nmany plants are scattered over the earth, or else restricted to\r\nlocalized regions, and which, without knowledge of the factors involved,\r\nseem merely the wayward caprice of nature.\r\n\r\nIn the flora of eastern North America there are many genera that appear\r\nto be endemic there (found nowhere else), but are actually duplicated in\r\neastern Asia, if not as to species, at any rate by plants so closely\r\nallied as to be of obviously common origin. These plants are unknown in\r\nEurope, or on our own western coast. The skunk cabbage, sassafras,\r\ntwinleaf, May apple, Canada moonseed, spice-bush, ginseng, sour gum,\r\ntrailing arbutus, fringe tree, lopseed and many others, all fairly\r\ncommon in eastern North America, are unknown between this and eastern\r\nAsia where, if not the identical species, which often happens, closely\r\nrelated forms are duplicated. The explanation of such discontinuous\r\npresent distribution appears to be that at some time in the distant past\r\nthere was a land connection between Asia and the western coast of\r\nAmerica, the remnants of which form the Aleutian Islands, and over which\r\nthere was a constant migration of plants and animals. With subsequently\r\nchanging climatic conditions on our own western coast, due to warm ocean\r\ncurrents, most of those Asiatic migrants, or it may have been a\r\nmigration in the opposite direction, were crowded out by later types\r\nwhich now dominate the Pacific coast. There is small chance that these\r\nplants were spread by birds, as an east-west bird migration is hardly\r\nlikely. Nor is there any record that the seed of these plants, even\r\nwhere they might float, would survive ocean transport.\r\n\r\nSometimes the ancestors of now widely separated species or genera once\r\ncovered all or nearly all the intervening area, and again sometimes only\r\na minute fraction of the ancient distribution is left at the present\r\ntime. Our own Big Trees of California were once known to grow in\r\nEngland, Iceland, all through central Europe and eastern Asia,\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, southern Chile, and from Texas to Alaska. In the\r\nface of such widespread occurrence in the past their present\r\ndistribution over an area of a few square miles is merely a pitiful\r\nrelic of ancient grandeur. Scores of cases are known where, instead of a\r\nsingle outpost as in the Big Trees, there are only a few widely\r\nscattered survivors from a probably much more continuous distribution in\r\nthe past. In northeastern North America there grows along pond sides and\r\nfresh-water beaches the shore-weed, a relative of our common weedy\r\nplantain. The only other species, and a close relative, comes from the\r\nsouthern tip of South America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME OF THE COMMONER PLANTS OF THE DESERT in the\r\nSouthwest.

Morris, released for publication here by\r\nthe Brooklyn Museum.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRASSLAND AND TREE VEGETATION. All over the\r\nworld there is a contest between grassland and tree vegetation for\r\ndominance wherever both occur. In this thorn veld in Natal the\r\nstruggle is particularly keen. (After Bews. Courtesy of Brooklyn\r\nBotanic Garden.)]\r\n\r\nMany other species now existing are to be viewed only as relics of a\r\nbygone, often much more continuous and more widespread dispersal. In the\r\npersimmons, of which over a hundred different kinds are now known, the\r\noriginal distribution covered all North America, all Europe and Asia,\r\nexcept the Scandinavian Peninsula, all of Africa, northern Australia and\r\nSouth America. To-day the genus is restricted mostly to tropical Asia,\r\nsouthern Africa, northern South America, and in North America it has\r\ndwindled to a handful of species confined to the region south of the\r\nGreat Lakes and generally east of the Mississippi. In Mexico and south\r\nof it the genus is better represented. But with the persimmon, as in so\r\nmany other types, our existing species are the remnants of preexisting\r\nones, without a knowledge of which their present dispersal would be\r\nimpossible to explain.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to reason from the foregoing that widely separated but\r\nrelated species of plants are all either very ancient, or directly\r\ndescended from ancient ancestors, and that other things being equal a\r\nwidely dispersed species is older than one with a restricted\r\ndistribution. It is most certainly true that relics are unquestionably\r\nvery ancient, and do actually represent the last outposts of a\r\npreexisting condition. But many isolated plants are relatively very new,\r\nso far as their immediate origin is concerned, as witness the hosts of\r\nyoung species of the daisy family, some of which have spread scarcely at\r\nall from their obvious point of origin. In judging of the distribution\r\nof even the commonest tree or shrub of our woodlands there are these\r\nlinks with the past, as well as response to present conditions, to be\r\nweighed if we are to understand the story aright.\r\n\r\nOnce a plant reaches a new and for it a strange country it is remarkable\r\nhow quickly it will often capture the new territory. In the United\r\nStates over six hundred of our commonest weeds have come from Europe and\r\nAsia. The daisy, dandelion, wild carrot, many hawkweeds, dozens of wild\r\nmustards, and many others are among the somewhat undesirable immigrants\r\nthat now reach over a great part of the country--all brought over by the\r\nearly settlers of America. From their home in subtropical Asia the\r\nlemon, lime, and orange have invaded every part of the tropical world.\r\nOnce, in the most remote part of the Sierra Maestra Mountains in eastern\r\nCuba, where only by the most arduous cutting could a passage through the\r\ndense tropical forest be forced, the writer found within a few square\r\nrods an orange and a tree from tropical India. Such cases could be\r\nmultiplied, and all over the world we see this endless struggle of\r\nplants to conquer new territory, often at the expense of existing\r\nvegetation. On Long Island, New York, the introduced locust tree,\r\nbrought from the southeastern United States about a hundred years ago,\r\nhas completely routed the native trees in many places along the north\r\nshore of the island. And in Hawaii, some seeds of a screw pine, washed\r\nup among refuse along the beach or brought in by early aborigines, have\r\nmade this Malayan plant a common tree thousands of miles from its home.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. HOME ECONOMY OF PLANTS, OR ECOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe geographic distribution of species of plants may be, as we have\r\nseen, the result of the geological changes of the past, of bird\r\nmigrations, of more or less fortuitously water-borne seeds, or more\r\nusually of the slow spreading by invasion of those species apparently\r\nnot so well supplied with external helps to dispersal. But no matter\r\nwhere plants grow, nor how they got there, they must fit the particular\r\nenvironment in which they find themselves or perish. This home economy\r\nof plants, or how they meet the environment and each other, is called\r\nPlant Ecology, a phase of botany now much studied, for it tells us more\r\ndirectly than most other plant research what the actual response to\r\nvarious factors of the environment may be. Just as plant distribution is\r\nthe reflection of many, usually widely operating forces, so ecology\r\nnarrows down to individual plants or groups of them the impact of the\r\nimmediately surrounding conditions upon vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe basis for all study of the response of plants to the conditions\r\nunder which they grow must rest upon the response of their different\r\norgans to those factors, just as our general movements are dictated by\r\nsufficient food or air or water to keep ordinary bodily functions going\r\nin the ordinary way. But the study of such plant response has shown that\r\ncertain kinds of environmental conditions have resulted in quite similar\r\nresponse nearly throughout the world. Often totally unrelated plants\r\nassume characteristically similar growth forms where the conditions in\r\nwidely separated areas are climatically or otherwise similar. In our own\r\nSouthwest we have the dominant cactus vegetation, matched in parts of\r\nSouth Africa by giant cactuslike spurges. In Mexico we find the wealth\r\nof century plants, which are confined to the New World, matched in the\r\nOld World dry regions by the aloe, a group of succulent plants nearly as\r\nwell suited to such areas. The _species_ of plants characterizing\r\npeculiar regions may well be the result of geographic distribution that\r\nrests on more widely operating factors such as we saw in the previous\r\nsection of this chapter, but the _type_ of plants growing in a\r\nparticular place hardly ever fails to be dictated by the local\r\ncondition. With this in mind, a vast amount of time has been spent in\r\nstudying the various factors of the environment, such as climate, soils,\r\naltitude, light, etc. And an equally valuable study has been the\r\nresponse of individual plants or their organs to such conditions. From\r\nthis great body of information, obviously impossible to include here, we\r\nall recognize certain well-marked societies or groupings of plants\r\nwhich, wherever they occur, exhibit similarity of general response to\r\nthe different conditions responsible for their occurrence. Once these\r\ntypical plant societies or groupings are understood we can recognize\r\nthem wherever they may occur, and we shall see that they are as\r\nwidespread as are plants themselves.\r\n\r\nJust as societies or races of men have often obscure beginnings, reach a\r\nclimax, and afterward die, so these plant societies may be considered as\r\nexhibiting a similar progression. What these plant societies are, at\r\nleast the more important of them, will be considered in the next section\r\nof this chapter. It should never be forgotten that the _species_ of\r\nplants making up the dominant plant societies in different parts of the\r\nworld are dictated by quite other conditions than those that result in\r\nthe dominance of the society itself. Perhaps as good an illustration as\r\nany is the aristocratic type of mankind, recognizable throughout the\r\nworld by the possession of finer qualities than the common run, but\r\ndiffering in individuals as much as the best type of Americans, the\r\nBritish peerage, and the samurai of Japan differ one from the other.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting feature of these plant societies is that we\r\nmust view them as associations of plants, often of widely differing\r\norigin due to the vicissitudes of plant distribution, but all taking\r\ntheir part in the society to which they belong and often, as\r\nindividuals, losing their life that the society may live. Upon such a\r\nconception a wood or prairie, or river bank, or salt marsh or alpine\r\ngarden upon a mountain summit are, with many other plant societies,\r\nplaces of intense conflict. More cruel than any human society, these\r\nplant communities exist under conditions where only the individually\r\nstrong survive, and only those societies are destined to reach their\r\nclimax which can take advantage of every aid, quite without regard for\r\nsevere losses or even death to the individual members of it. It is as if\r\nwe poured into a crucible molten metals from many different sources, and\r\nafter the incredible and relentless forces of manufacture had worked\r\ntheir magic upon them there resulted a product, purified and cleared of\r\nall dross. So the inexorable and relentless processes of nature work\r\nover the materials found in these plant communities, the results of\r\nwhich are the dominant types of vegetation in the world to-day. With\r\nthis understanding of the part they play in plant distribution we may\r\nnow consider a few of the most widely recognized plant societies and see\r\nhow they have affected the vegetation, sometimes even the history of the\r\nregions in which they are found.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SOME OF THE CHIEF PLANT SOCIETIES\r\n\r\n\r\nForests\r\n\r\nNo one who has ever seen both our temperate forests and those in the\r\ntropics can fail to be impressed with the difference between them. Not\r\nonly for the different plants in them, but for their wholly different\r\naspect, tropical and temperate forests stand far apart as an expression\r\nof the forest covering the earth. Not all of us realize, however, that\r\nthe heat of the tropics is not the deciding factor in the luxuriance of\r\nthose dim jungles, and that a rainfall far above anything occurring in\r\nthe United States is even more important. Upon the distribution of\r\nrainfall depends the occurrence not only of the two forest types that\r\nwill be mentioned here, but of most of the other chief plant societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROPICAL RAIN FOREST\r\n\r\nA small section along the lower side of the Gulf of Mexico, the\r\nnortheastern edges of Cuba and Santo Domingo, nearly all of the region\r\ndrained by the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers; in the Congo, Zanzibar, and\r\nMadagascar in Africa; all of southeastern Asia, including the East\r\nIndies and part of the north coast of Australia--these comprise the\r\nregions of the tropical rain forest. All of them have, besides\r\ncontinuous heat, a nearly continuous or in some places a periodic\r\nrainfall, averaging over, and usually much over, eighty-five inches a\r\nyear, as compared with about half that near New York. There are, of\r\ncourse, other places in the world where these rain forests, so called\r\nfrom their abundant moisture and some of the effects of it, are found.\r\nBut in the regions mentioned they are at once the most wonderful and to\r\nmost white men the most awesome manifestations of the plant world.\r\n\r\nSuch forests seem, and actually are, pulsating with life, as instruments\r\nstationed in them have many times proved. With some kinds of bamboo\r\ngrowing over two feet a day, and a eucalyptus tree in Java forty-five\r\nfeet in three years--and these are not isolated cases--the tremendous\r\nannual increase in the amount of vegetation can be glimpsed. Of course\r\nnot all the plants in them grow at any such rate, but the great heat and\r\nabundant moisture does make tropical rain forests irresistible in their\r\npower. Plantation owners, and railways that have been run through such\r\nforests, wage constant warfare against the recapture by the teeming\r\nforest of man’s intrusion of it. The writer once saw in Santo Domingo a\r\nrailway cut through such a jungle and abandoned only two or three years\r\nbefore. Not a trace of the roadbed could be found, ties, rails, and\r\nswitches all covered with a dense vegetation, and overhead the canopy of\r\nthe forest had closed over the opening and was already sending down\r\nhundreds of adventitious roots that would complete the obliteration of\r\nman’s handiwork. Everywhere there is the evidence of vegetable life run\r\nriot, ever crowding and pushing to close up openings made by the\r\ncrashing down of old trees or the artificial clearings of man. Those\r\nliving on the edges of such forests speak and think of them as dim,\r\nmysterious places where strange creatures and the ever-present fevers\r\njoin forces with the vegetation to keep out humankind. That they are\r\nplaces of actual danger everyone knows who recalls that Stanley’s trip\r\nthrough equatorial Africa cost one hundred and seventy lives, many of\r\nwhich were sacrificed to disease and strangely enough nine were lost\r\nthrough starvation. While the tropics supply much of the food used\r\nthere, these jungles produce almost none of it and because of the\r\nscarcity of edible fruits, the extraordinary difficulty of getting about\r\nand collecting what does grow, starvation faces anyone who goes into\r\nthem without adequate supplies.\r\n\r\nIn the Amazon grows the largest water lily in the world, _Victoria\r\nregia_, with giant leaves upon which a moderate-sized man may stand in\r\nsafety. It produces a flower over a foot in diameter, and it is\r\nsurrounded by a forest the like of which it is difficult to describe.\r\nH. H. Rusby, who spent two years in this region hunting for medicinal\r\nplants, has described the country a few hundred miles below where\r\n_Victoria_ was discovered. He writes: “Passing down the river Madeira to\r\nthe lower Amazon, we come into a region of such grandeur in its\r\nvegetation that it is difficult of comprehension, even by one who is an\r\neyewitness. Everything is in such proportion that one is apt in its size\r\nto miss the gigantic. Many of the trees of this region are undoubtedly\r\nmany centuries old and appear to be good for many centuries more. Most\r\nof them have enormous buttresses at the base, and these buttresses often\r\nbegin as high above the ground as are the tops of ordinary forest trees\r\nin our land. All are bound together with an impenetrable mass of tough\r\nvines. Running through these swamps are the most beautiful little bayous\r\nor canals. Nothing can exceed in interest and delight a day’s canoeing\r\namong these narrow waterways, although there is great danger that the\r\ninexperienced boatman will hopelessly lose his way. In the rainy season\r\nthis river rises sixty feet or more above its low water mark and the\r\nboatman travels among the tree tops which a few weeks before were high\r\nabove his head.”\r\n\r\nThe abundant water supply in the rain forests results in an atmosphere\r\nsaturated with water vapor and in some of them it is a common sight in\r\nthe morning to see the forest rising out of an unbroken blanket of mist.\r\nAs this dries up under the heat of the day, or if there occurs one of\r\nthe torrential downpours to which such regions are frequently subjected,\r\nthere rises from the forest in plainly visible waves a vast quantity of\r\nwater vapor. It is this that has so often made them be described as\r\nsteaming forests. The water requirements of the plants are more than\r\nsupplied, nay, there is such a surfeit of available water in all these\r\nforests, that there are numberless devices to get rid of the excess.\r\nDripping points to the leaves, already described in an earlier chapter,\r\nare common. But in addition many plants have wonderfully colored leaves\r\nsuch as Begonias, some relatives of our jack-in-the-pulpit belonging to\r\nthe Arum family, many orchids, and other plants. The colored leaves in\r\nthe predominantly dark green and gloomy rain forest, because of their\r\ngreater absorption of light and consequently higher transpiration rate,\r\nare of decided advantage.\r\n\r\nWhile there is thus very little or in fact almost no struggle for water\r\nin the rain forest, the struggle for light is intense. In the deepest\r\nand most luxuriant of them the gloom of the forest floor is notorious\r\nand it was by no means a figure of speech for Stanley to describe his\r\ntrip through equatorial Africa as “Through the Dark Continent.” So dark\r\nare most rain forests, and, as we have seen in a previous chapter, so\r\ninexorable are the plants’ demands for light, that the various devices\r\nto insure it are perhaps the one great difference between these forests\r\nand those of temperate regions. One effect of the struggle for light is\r\nthe enormous production of vines often running hundreds of feet through\r\nthe tree tops. In India the _Calamus_, or rattan palms, with stems no\r\nthicker than a walking-stick, will completely interlace the foliage of\r\nthe canopy. Thousands of slender whiplike roots and stems of such plants\r\ndescend from the topmost heights of the forest canopy, where the plants\r\nto which they are attached make such an inextricable tangle among the\r\ntree tops that orchid collectors have been known to travel considerable\r\ndistances over the matted vegetation, with, it must be confessed,\r\nconsiderable danger. These vines or _lianes_ as they are called, are\r\nhowever, often as thick as a man’s body and armed with great hooked\r\nprickles, an obvious aid in catching some support to reach that\r\nessential light for which all plants in such places are ever striving.\r\n\r\nBesides the bewildering tangle caused by these lianes, the rain forest\r\nis further impeded by hosts of epiphytes or plants that are mechanically\r\nattached to tree trunks, branches, or anything else that will raise them\r\nto the light. Of all the plants of such regions the epiphytes are the\r\nmost light-demanding. They must not be mistaken for parasites, as they\r\nhave roots of their own through which they absorb nourishment, mostly as\r\nwater vapor, but also as liquid water held in the bark and refuse in\r\nwhich they grow. Thousands of orchids are epiphytes, also ferns, and,\r\nonly in the American tropics, thousands of different relatives of the\r\npineapple. Many of the latter are among the most gorgeously colored of\r\nall plants, their superb foliage being much sought after and the\r\nspecimens largely grown in our greenhouses. In most rain forests every\r\navailable inch of space is covered by these epiphytes, so that no bark,\r\nscarcely any branches, are to be seen but those clothed in this motley\r\narray of plants that use the support to get the utmost possible light.\r\nMany of these epiphytes have rosettes of leaves arranged for holding\r\nwater, and after a sharp thunder shower followed by fresh wind the\r\nwriter has seen the ground strewn with thousands of relatives of the\r\npineapple which, with the added supply of water, were unable to stand\r\nthe strain and were consequently wrenched from their lofty perch. So\r\nenormous is the combined weight of these epiphytes, together with the\r\nlianes, that many trees crash down under the strain long before their\r\ntime. Perhaps no sight of the rain forest so convinces one of the\r\nstruggle for light as to see one of these forest monarchs come crashing\r\ndown loaded with thousands of plants that have been using it for\r\nsupport, and to escape which it has pushed its canopy to the utmost\r\nlimits of its growth. Such contests are common in a forest of which only\r\nthe barest outlines can be conveyed to those who have never seen it. To\r\nthose who have had that good fortune any description palls beside the\r\nwonderful actuality.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to be wondered at that these steaming rain forests with\r\ntheir gloom, and, as they were once described, “all hung about with\r\nfever trees,” should be dreaded by many, and the subject of fabulous\r\ntales to the credulous. The almost incredible difficulty of getting\r\nthrough them, not to mention the savage animals that inhabit many of\r\nthem, have not lessened the tendency to exaggerate about these great\r\nforests. But the truth about them is so far beyond belief, the strange\r\nplants that intrepid explorers have brought out of them so almost\r\nincredible, that it only excited a temporary wonderment when the largest\r\nflower in the world was discovered in such a forest in the Malayan\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nSir Stanford Raffles and Dr. Arnold, while exploring in Sumatra during\r\nthe year 1818, discovered what was called “the greatest prodigy of the\r\nvegetable world,” and no flower since found equals its size. The plant,\r\nwithout stem or leaves, consists wholly of one gigantic flower about\r\nnine feet in circumference, and was subsequently called _Rafflesia\r\nArnoldii_. It aroused a sensation in England which was not abated by\r\nknowledge of the fact that the flower is a parasite on the stems of\r\ncertain tropical plants related to the grape. That such a huge flower\r\nshould be the product of a parasitic mode of life is one more\r\nillustration of how this and related irregularities occur in widely\r\nseparated families of plants, and under varying conditions. Relatives of\r\nit have since been found in India, some parasitic on roots, others, as\r\nin _Rafflesia Arnoldii_, on the stems of vines. The sticky seeds are in\r\nall probability carried from place to place on the hoofs of elephants,\r\nto which they have been known to cling. Only if they are deposited on a\r\nbruised or otherwise exposed tissue of their future host can they grow.\r\nThese curious plants have been actually cultivated in the greatest\r\ntropical botanical garden in the world, at Buitenzorg, Java.\r\n\r\nThe original collectors of _Rafflesia Arnoldii_ could scarcely credit\r\ntheir senses when they saw for the first time this extraordinary plant,\r\nwhose whole life is spent in producing this great flower and fruit. As\r\none of them says: “Had I been alone, and had there been no witnesses, I\r\nthink I should have been fearful of mentioning the dimensions of this\r\nflower, so much does it exceed every flower I have ever seen or heard\r\nof.” The odor of the flower is repulsive, and, with its great size and\r\ncurious mode of growth in the dark rain forest, it is surely one of the\r\nstrangest productions of the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nBut as the utmost development of the plant world, and producing the\r\ngreatest profusion and richness of plant life, these rain forests are,\r\nbeyond the sporadic occurrence of such wonders as _Rafflesia_ and some\r\nothers, places of extraordinary interest. With every inch of space\r\noccupied by plants, the very epiphytes often having on their leaves\r\nstill smaller plants, we see here what nature will produce when the\r\nmaximum conditions for plant growth are so nearly perfect. Theodore\r\nRoosevelt in his book, “Through the Brazilian Wilderness,” gives a vivid\r\npicture of the rain forest there, and it may well end our account of\r\nthose most interesting of all plant societies:\r\n\r\n“In one grove the fig trees were killing the palms, just as in Africa\r\nthey kill the sandalwood trees. In the gloom of this grove there were no\r\nflowers, no bushes; the air was heavy; the ground was brown with\r\nmoldering leaves. Almost every palm was serving as a prop for a fig\r\ntree. The fig trees were in every stage of growth. The youngest ones\r\nmerely ran up the palms as vines. In the next state the vine had\r\nthickened and was sending out shoots, wrapping the palm stem in a deadly\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n“Some of the shoots were thrown round the stem like the tentacles of an\r\nimmense cuttlefish. Others looked like claws that were hooked into every\r\ncrevice, and round every projection. In the stage beyond this the palm\r\nhad been killed, and its dead carcass appeared between the big, winding\r\nvine trunks; and later the palm had disappeared and the vines had united\r\nin a great fig tree. Water stood in black pools at the foot of the\r\nmurdered trees, and of the trees that had murdered them. There was\r\nsomething sinister and evil in the dark stillness of the grove; it\r\nseemed as if sentient beings had writhed themselves round and were\r\nstrangling other sentient beings.”\r\n\r\nMany other forests in the tropics, where the rainfall is less, or less\r\nregularly distributed, are not unlike our own, having rather regular\r\nperiods of leaf-fall that come with the dry season rather than with the\r\nautumn. The trees are of course never the same as ours, but the general\r\naspect is not very different from that of temperate forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATE FORESTS IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nThe transition from the tropical rain forest to our own woodlands is one\r\nof the most interesting, as it is certainly the most gradual in nature.\r\nLack of space prevents our stopping to note those strategic points along\r\nthis pathway from a hot, steaming forest to the cool shade of our open\r\nwoods, where traveling, in at least a virgin forest, may be done easily\r\non horseback. As we come northward, and if we could travel continuously\r\nthrough the forest, we should lose first the epiphytes, then most of the\r\nlianes, and finally all the condition of vegetation crowding into every\r\ninch of space suitable for it. While trees in our virgin forests are as\r\nthick as they can be, the forest floor is open and on it grow only a few\r\nherbs that will stand lack of sunshine.\r\n\r\nBut the really great difference is the long, unfavorable season in\r\ntemperate regions where the forest must drop all its leaves, after, in\r\nat least our own Eastern States, the most gorgeous foliage coloring of\r\nany forest in the world. The winter months when the woody vegetation is\r\npractically fully exposed to the elements, are particularly severe in\r\ntheir effects. Leaf-fall, which is such a common sight as to arouse\r\nscarcely any interest, is the only device by which the great bulk of our\r\nforest trees survive, and only in the southern part of the region are\r\nthere found such woody plants as the mountain laurel, rhododendron,\r\nAmerican holly, and a few others which are evergreen but not\r\ncone-bearing ones, and are the only reminders of the truly evergreen\r\nforests of the tropics. The winter winds farther north and in the\r\ncentral treeless part of the United States prove too much for many kinds\r\nof trees, for instance, all the oaks and sassafras, none of which go\r\nvery far north.\r\n\r\nThere is sufficient rainfall to produce forests much farther north than\r\nthey are found, but lower temperatures prevent trees from growing just\r\nas too little water stops their growth altogether. Toward the northern\r\nlimits, or upon high mountains, the upper limits of the forest, we get\r\nthe best idea of how persistent woody vegetation is in the general\r\nforest area of the eastern United States. Stunted, wind-swept and\r\nweather-beaten trees are often found only a couple of feet high and over\r\nsixty years old. Sometimes they will be flattened out on the ground or\r\non bare rock, making great patches of bushy growth quite unlike their\r\nlofty relations in the lowlands. The growth rate for such plants is so\r\nslow that their annual rings are all but obscured. With such persistence\r\nin the production of these elfin forests, high up on mountains under the\r\nmost unfavorable conditions, it is little wonder that below this are\r\ntrackless woods, and that the northeastern United States has one of the\r\nfinest developments of the temperate or summer forest in the world.\r\n\r\nNor are all our woods of this general type made up of the same species,\r\nfor everyone knows about the endless spruce and fir forests of the\r\nnorth, exclusively evergreen, and in the summer nearly always moist.\r\nThis spruce belt stretches practically across the continent, where, in\r\nthe West, other and our most gigantic evergreens, replace the eastern\r\nspruce and fir. A little farther south is the region of the white pine\r\nnow nearly unknown as a virgin forest type, as its great value led to\r\nearly and ruthless cutting. The white pine region is generally the area\r\nfrom New England southward along the Alleghenies and westward to\r\nIllinois. But the most characteristic of the temperate forest types is\r\nour summer forest, so called from its general lack of evergreens and its\r\nbeautiful green foliage of summer and its bare branches in winter. Beech\r\nand birch and maple, in different proportions according to local\r\nconditions, predominate in such woods. These hard-wooded trees, with\r\nmany others that are scattered through them, have been among the most\r\nvaluable of all the natural plant products of our country and their\r\ndestruction has been upon such a scale that only in a few places may the\r\nvirgin forest be seen at the present time. Where it does occur we find\r\nthe forest floor often with nothing growing on it except a mass of\r\nspring flowers which are half matured before the leaves of the forest\r\ncanopy close out nearly all the light and much water and put them to\r\nrest until another year. The great preponderance of spring-flowering\r\nherbs in Eastern North America is due to their early warming up before\r\nthe foliage of the trees cuts off their light. And in some virgin\r\nforests of this sort, particularly where there is a large mixture of\r\noak, the writer has seen hundreds of square rods without undergrowth or\r\nherbaceous vegetation of any kind. Such places, very rare indeed at the\r\npresent time due to senseless and wicked cutting, are rather dark,\r\nperfectly open to view for hundreds of feet ahead, and dotted only with\r\nthe huge trunks of the trees that characterize this climax type of the\r\ntemperate or summer forest.\r\n\r\nThe absence of direct sunlight and interception of much rain under the\r\nforest canopy has other effects besides stopping the growth of herbs and\r\nshrubs which are common enough along the edges, or where openings are\r\nmade by the fall of old trees. It prevents the germination and growth of\r\nnearly all the seeds falling from such trees, and in a really virgin\r\nforest of this sort, almost no seedlings will be found. Upon cleared or\r\nopen land thousands of saplings will cover much of the ground, but\r\nnearly all these will die off due to crowding, and leave as the climax\r\nonly enough trees to close over the forest canopy.\r\n\r\nForests may be found in all stages of succession from those just\r\nbeginning the process to those final forest monarchs which, having won\r\nout in the race, are, until one of them falls, often slow to perpetuate\r\nthe type. For, as often as not, a new growth will spring up once a very\r\nlarge tree falls, and a very different kind of growth from the climax\r\nforest. At once a host of species, that one might almost say had been\r\nwaiting for the tragedy of the monarch’s fall, will rush in and convert\r\nthe opening into a nondescript brush patch, out of which will rise\r\nanother tree that means business. As it grows to maturity, it kills off\r\nthese smaller triflers one by one, until, when the canopy is finally\r\nclosed, all of them will have disappeared, or, as often happens,\r\nretreated to other parts of the forest, where they wait for another\r\nchance. This succession of different kinds of growth in a temperate\r\nforest is so well known that in England they have for centuries\r\npracticed it, for commercial or pleasure purposes. In their oak-hazel\r\ncopses they cut the trees enough to partly open the canopy, which\r\npermits a dense growth of hazel bushes and other plants. Every twelve or\r\nfifteen years the latter are cut down for various purposes, and will\r\ngradually spring up again to renew the dense growth. The spacing of the\r\ntrees is sufficient for them to branch freely and yet not close the\r\ncanopy enough to kill off the hazel. The trees are cut off a few at a\r\ntime, not oftener than one or two hundred years in any one spot. By this\r\nprocedure the owner gets a regular crop of hazel once in twelve or\r\nfifteen years, occasional big trees, and on many places a cover for\r\npheasants. Under the hazel there is a regular progression of herbs, very\r\nplentiful just after the bushes are cut, and decreasing almost to\r\nnothing when the end of the growth period of the bushes is near.\r\n\r\nThe English oak-hazel copse, now much less grown than formerly, and the\r\ngeneral lack of undergrowth in our own virgin forests, are both\r\nresponses of the forest to light and other factors that are related to\r\nan open or closed canopy. As we stated a page or two back, it is not\r\nimpossible, it is even frequent in some parts of the country, for a\r\nforest to produce, by its own growth, conditions inimical to its\r\nperpetuation. Where the casual falling of a forest giant is the only\r\nopportunity which that forest offers to perpetuate its type, it may well\r\nbe said to be a climax forest, incapable of further development. But in\r\nsome such woods a curious provision of nature insures an invasion of the\r\ngloomy forests by trees less light-demanding than the dominant ones. And\r\noften these trees that can get along with less light will capture\r\nconsiderable parts of forests that light-demanding trees could never\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\nIf the soil in which these temperate forests happen to grow is sandy or\r\notherwise poor in plant food, the broad-leaved trees that make our woods\r\nsuch a delight in summer are replaced almost universally by pines. Along\r\nthe sandy stretches of the coastal plain from Long Island, New York, to\r\nthe Gulf, there are immense tracts of these pine forests, different\r\nspecies often being locally dominant, such as the pitch pine in the pine\r\nbarrens of New Jersey and the long-leaf pine farther south. Almost\r\nthroughout the world there is this monopolization of the poorer and\r\ndrier forest sites by pines, which maintain the forest plant society in\r\nregions where the broad-leaved rapidly transpiring trees could not grow.\r\n\r\nNo account of forests, however brief, can omit some mention of the\r\ngreatest agency for their protection in North America, the United States\r\nForest Service. With corporation and individual cutting and attendant\r\nfire hazard upon a scale almost beyond belief in its ruthless disregard\r\nof our chief natural plant product, the Government soon found that\r\nFederal ownership or control of forests was the only policy that would\r\nmaintain even a partially adequate timber supply. National forests, set\r\naside either for pleasure or profit, now total more than the area of\r\nFrance or than all the New England and most of the Middle Atlantic\r\nStates. These huge tracts, in every part of the country where forests\r\nare found, are well managed, properly planted, and most important of\r\nall, constantly guarded against fire. Forest fires not only destroyed\r\nover $25,000,000 worth of timber annually, but leaving devastation\r\nbehind them, depleted the water supply in many parts of the country.\r\nNothing but forests will hold the rainfall, to release it slowly\r\nthrough a thousand rivulets and springs that are the source of countless\r\nrivers. With the forest cut or burned off these streams are dry most of\r\nthe summer and raging torrents for a few weeks in the spring, washing\r\nout all the priceless accumulation of the ages which the forest has\r\nconserved for its own and our benefit. While the reservation of these\r\ngreat national forests has worked individual hardship, experience for\r\nmany years back in India and Germany shows Federal ownership or control\r\nthe only wise policy.\r\n\r\nForest covering, whether temperate or tropical, depends for its\r\noccurrence all over the world upon an adequate rainfall. As we have seen\r\nin the tropics, this may be so great that coupled with the heat it\r\nproduces a wealth of vegetation beyond the powers of description. Where\r\nit is less and the country cooler, the forests are of a different type,\r\nbut even there the forest covering is, without interference, practically\r\ncomplete. Where, as in parts of Chile, southeastern Australia, and of\r\nJapan, there is a heavy rainfall but cool climate, there is a so-called\r\ntemperate rain forest. Such forests are cold, drab, wet woods of\r\npeculiar aspect and extreme interest. For in them grow trees sometimes\r\nrelated to our own, but, due to the special conditions, producing a\r\nforest landscape quite unlike anything in America. It would seem as if\r\nwe might almost plot the distribution of forests in our own country with\r\na weather map showing rainfall, and such is actually the case. When the\r\nrainfall becomes less than will maintain forest growth it stops, often\r\nvery abruptly. Generally speaking, the region west of the Mississippi,\r\nand some just east of it, westward to the mountains, is entirely devoid\r\nof forest, except in the river valleys. The forests give place to an\r\nentirely different type of vegetation--the prairie or grassland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIE OR GRASSLANDS\r\n\r\nIn nearly every region in the world there is an absence of forests and a\r\nreplacement of them by grasslands, where the rainfall is less than about\r\ntwenty-five inches a year, and where the winter winds, often far below\r\nthe freezing point, are hostile to trees. The distribution of the rain\r\nmostly through the growing season also makes a condition peculiarly\r\nunfavorable for trees during the winter. Someone has said that the\r\nnations have fought since the days of the Romans for the belt of\r\ngrassland which these climatic conditions have produced all round the\r\nworld, and it is certainly true that these naturally grass-covered areas\r\nhave produced the cereals of the world, all of which, except rice, grow\r\nto best advantage in such regions.\r\n\r\nWith of course different species of grass and quite different associated\r\nherbs, these grasslands are now found in our own prairies, the steppes\r\nof Russia, the plains of Hungary, the pampas of southern South America,\r\nthe grasslands of Australia, the veld in Natal and in many other but\r\nmostly less extensive developments. Some of the grassland regions are\r\nwarm, but without more rainfall than characterizes such areas the\r\ngreater heat does not produce a forest. Usually, but not always, these\r\ngrasslands are not found near the coast, where, as in America, the\r\nrainfall is double that of the plains and produces the forests that\r\nclothe the Atlantic and Pacific sections of the country. From the east\r\nwestward there is a gradual decrease in the rainfall, until from about\r\nthe Mississippi to the mountains it falls below the point where trees\r\ncan compete with the prairie.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of prairies that once they have started tends to\r\nkeep out trees is their almost annual firing. Tree seedlings cannot\r\nsurvive this, and we know that the Indians fired huge tracts of prairie\r\nevery year, not to mention fires started by lightning which may set fire\r\nto grasslands and actually does set fire to forests every year.\r\n\r\nThe prairies in the United States--perhaps the most extensive in the\r\nworld--are characterized chiefly by several grasses, buffalo grass\r\n(_Buchloë dactyloides_), gama grass (_Bouletoua oligostachya_), and\r\nseveral prairie grasses, such as _Sporobolus asperifolius_, _Koeleria\r\ncristata_, and some others. Among these, depending on the soil, are\r\nhundreds of prairie flowers which, during different parts of a single\r\nseason, give quite different aspects to the region. Both the grasses and\r\ntheir associated herbs are well protected against too violent\r\ntranspiration which their exposure to nearly continuous sunshine, high\r\nsummer heat, and very considerable winds makes particularly active. In\r\nmany places where the country is rolling, the lower and moister sites,\r\nbesides developing more luxuriant growth of prairie plants, permits low\r\nshrubs, and in river bottoms even trees to flourish. But climatic\r\nconditions of small rainfall, high winds, and bitter winters make\r\nanything like a forest development out of the question.\r\n\r\nIn some regions, both in America and central Europe, a rainfall that is\r\nhigh enough to permit trees to exist and low enough to favor at the same\r\ntime a grassland formation has resulted in the parklike landscape that\r\ncreates the most beautiful scenic features of the regions where it\r\noccurs. In such places there are irregular patches of forest and\r\ngrassland, and the struggle for supremacy as between the different types\r\ndepends, not upon the general climatic conditions to which they both\r\nrespond, but to local conditions of available water supply and soil\r\nconditions and often upon fires. Naturally such regions are places of\r\nintense strife for dominance, and in them some remarkable collections of\r\nplants have been found.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of these struggles between grassland and\r\nwoody vegetation in a region climatically able to produce both, is in\r\nNatal. Large sections of that country are grasslands or veld, as the\r\npeople there call it. Scattered through the veld are various species of\r\nacacia trees, locally called thorn, with feathery compound leaves. These\r\ndo not shut out enough light to prevent the development of grasses\r\ndirectly under their shade, yet the annual firing of the veld prevents,\r\nexcept accidentally, the production of the acacias. But the seeds of\r\nthis tree, whether from long usage to this burning or not, are actually\r\nhastened in their germination by the firing, and it is a common practice\r\nin that country to roast or partly boil the seeds of the tree to hasten\r\ngermination. The presence of the climatically favorable environment for\r\nboth trees and grassland results in the latter being the dominant type\r\nof vegetation over large tracts of the country, largely because fires\r\ndestroy tree seedlings, and yet the tree seeds, by a quite extraordinary\r\nfitness for their peculiar environment, offer a measure of insurance\r\nagainst the total destruction of woody vegetation by the grassland.\r\n\r\nThe pampas of the Argentine have been vividly described by P. G.\r\nLorentz, who, in writing of the drier parts of it, says: “Viewed from a\r\ndistance, these grasses seem to form a close grassy covering, and the\r\npampa presents the appearance of extensive grassy tracts whose coloring\r\nvaries with the seasons: coal black in the spring, when the old grass\r\nhas been burned; bright green, the color of the mature grass;\r\nfinally--at flowering time--when the silvery white spikes overtop the\r\ngrass, over wide tracts it seems like a rolling, waving sea of liquid\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n“After the Gramineæ (grasses), the family of plants that is represented\r\nin the pampas by the greatest number of individuals is that of Compositæ\r\n(daisy family); usually twiggy undershrubs with inconspicuous flowers, a\r\nbright yellow _Solidago_ (golden-rod) alone gleams out from among the\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\nHere, as in the other grasslands of the world, if a local water supply\r\nabove the general requirements of the grass exists, there is always a\r\nsmall element of woody plants, low, thick-leaved shrubs usually, but\r\nwhere water is more plentiful, trees, as in the region in Natal, already\r\nmentioned, and in many other parts of the world, notably parts of\r\nAustralia, China, Brazil, and many sections of the western part of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWe see in grasslands a plant response to rainfall and other climatic\r\nconditions which, with a little more rainfall, or in locally wet places,\r\nalways produces woody growth, either as tongues of woods in river\r\nbottoms or the parklike landscape, already mentioned. If, however, the\r\nrainfall is too low to produce even the grasses and their associated\r\nherbs, an entirely different type of vegetation usurps these still more\r\ndry regions, resulting in some of those strange plants of the deserts,\r\namong which water storage is practically universal, as is the ability to\r\nlive for long periods without rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERTS\r\n\r\nOf absolute deserts there are none in North America, for no part of it\r\nis so dry that plants of some sort do not grow, and in fact in hardly\r\nany part of the world are there regions of any considerable extent where\r\nplant life of any kind is lacking. There is a small section of northern\r\nChile and adjacent regions on the western slopes of the Andes where\r\nnothing grows, and the traveler is met with a cheerless landscape of\r\nbare ground and sandy or stony soil. There is no record of it ever\r\nhaving rained in such places, and if there be only a single rain\r\nconsisting of a fraction of an inch a year, a few plants, usually\r\nscraggly low herbs with thick leaves or else quick-flowering annuals\r\nwill be found.\r\n\r\nBut there are hundreds of thousands of square miles of the earth’s\r\nsurface where the rainfall is sufficient to produce plant life, but\r\nwhere it hardly exceeds five or at most six inches in a year, and in\r\nsome regions is less than two inches. From several different stations in\r\nthe desert area of our own Southwest the average annual rainfall is\r\nabout five and a half inches. Such regions produce a desert type of\r\nvegetation and are popularly, if not properly, called deserts. The\r\nlargest is of course the Sahara in Africa, but there are huge tracts in\r\nArabia, China, Thibet, Australia, South Africa, and in some other\r\ncountries where the conditions for plant life are so unfavorable that\r\nonly in the better sites are plants found at all. In all deserts there\r\nare very large areas entirely without plants, due to shifting sand or\r\nother local conditions, which, added to the generally unfavorable\r\nclimate, make plant life impossible.\r\n\r\nWith rainfall so low and in most of the regions the temperature so high,\r\nthe vegetation must be insured against too rapid transpiration. Perhaps\r\nthe best illustration of how high transpiration both in plants and in\r\nman may be in such regions is gained by a statement of D. T. MacDougal,\r\nwho writes of man traveling in the desert that “the amount (of water)\r\nthrown off the skin is correspondingly great, and if the loss is not\r\nmade good, thirst ensues and ten hours’ lack of water may thicken the\r\ntongue so that speech is impossible.”\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions it is not surprising that desert plants are among\r\nthe most curious and weird members of the plant world. Every device both\r\nto retard transpiration and to store up water to last over a completely\r\nrainless period, may be found. In America, to which all the hundreds of\r\ndifferent species of cactus are practically confined, we find giant\r\nforms, often covered with spines and prickles which prevent their\r\ndestruction by cattle, and many others that hug the dry sandy soil with\r\ncurious tortuous branches. None of them have leaves such as plants of\r\nthe forest or grassland possess, for desert plants cannot afford the\r\nluxury of foliage that, because of too rapid water loss, would destroy\r\ntheir chance to survive. Cacti do produce tiny leaves at the ends of\r\ntheir joints, but as if recognizing the inhospitable world into which\r\nthey are born, practically all of them drop off, so that for the great\r\nbulk of the life of most cacti only the bare branches are evident. In\r\nmost kinds these branches are green, assume the functions of leaves,\r\nsuch as transpiration and the manufacture of food by photosynthesis.\r\n\r\nWhile in cacti and in the giant cactuslike spurges of South Africa the\r\nability to store water is tremendously developed--our giant cereus or\r\nsaguaro often holding 125 gallons--most desert plants rely upon\r\nretarding transpiration for their existence. Leafless shrubs and trees\r\nwhose often spiny branches are green and perform, on a much-reduced\r\nscale, the function of leaves, are among the most common characteristics\r\nof desert plants. Some, as _Parkinsonia microphylla_ or paloverde, have\r\ntiny leaves which they put out during the spring showers, but quickly\r\nlose them as it gets hotter and drier toward midsummer. Many of the\r\nplants that do produce leaves regularly have the surface of them so\r\nshiny as to appear varnished, or so thickly coated with hairs as to\r\nsimulate cotton or wool, both of which reduce transpiration. There are\r\nmany plants, some of which do not even live in a desert but in a locally\r\ndry habitat, that also have the utmost development of structure to\r\nprevent transpiration. One of the most extraordinary is the vegetable\r\nsheep in New Zealand. An inhabitant of dry rocky places, its water\r\nsupply, although rainfall is fairly abundant, is precarious due to\r\ndrainage and the failure of the rock to prevent run-off. The different\r\nspecies of _Raoulia_, of which _R. eximia_ is one of the best known, are\r\nadmirably adapted to exist under such conditions. L. Cockayne, an\r\nauthority on the flora of that island, writes of these strange plants:\r\n“Perhaps the most striking denizens of rocks are the various kinds of\r\nvegetable sheep (species of _Raoulia_), which form hard cushions, mostly\r\nwhite, but occasionally green--and of enormous size. The raoulia\r\ncushions are all constructed on the same plan. Above, the stems branch\r\nagain and again, and toward their extremities are covered with small\r\nwoolly leaves, packed as tightly as possible. Finally stems, leaves, and\r\nall are pressed into a dense hard convex mass, making, in the case of\r\n_Raoulia eximia_, an excellent and appropriate seat for a tired\r\nbotanist. Within the plant is a peat made of rotting leaves and\r\nbranches, which holds water like a sponge, and into which the final\r\nbranchlets send roots. Thus the plant lives in great measure on its own\r\ndecay, and the woody main root serves chiefly as an anchor. The\r\nvegetable sheep are not inaptly named, for at a distance a shepherd\r\nmight be misled.” The genus _Raoulia_ belongs to the daisy family, and\r\nfurnishes another illustration of the remarkable diversity of this\r\nlargest and probably most recent of the families of flowering plants,\r\nwhich appears to have originated in the Andes and now covers the world.\r\n\r\nIn Damaraland, Southwest Africa, the most remarkable desert plant was\r\ndiscovered years ago, growing in a sandy and stony plain where the\r\nrainfall for fourteen years has not averaged more than two and a quarter\r\ninches annually. There are sea fogs, however, upon the condensation of\r\nwhich upon sheets of glass the discoverers of _Welwitschia mirabilis_\r\nrelied for some of their scanty water supply. The plant, whose woody\r\nstem is deep buried in the ground with only the top appearing above the\r\nsurface, looks not unlike “the burnt crust of a loaf of bread.” To this\r\nonly two large leaves are attached. These are many feet long and split\r\ninto several sections which undulate over the ground very like the\r\ntentacles of an octopus. With such strange products of the desert\r\nscattered over the plains it is little wonder that _Welwitschia_ caused\r\na sensation only equaled by the discovery of _Rafflesia_ in the rain\r\nforest of Sumatra.\r\n\r\nWhile deserts seem to be the most unfavorable places in which plants can\r\nexist, and their very existence in many deserts is often a precarious\r\naffair, it should be kept in mind that the soil of such places is often\r\nby no means sterile. As we found in the section of this book on “How\r\nPlants Get Their Food,” water is absolutely necessary for the absorption\r\nof food through the root hairs. Where, as in an oasis in the desert,\r\nwater is locally plentiful a luxuriant vegetation springs up, and one of\r\nthe most fertile parts of our Southwest was transformed from a desert by\r\nirrigation. Then, too, in many deserts there is a pronounced rainy\r\nseason during which there is a marvelous development of showy flowering\r\nherbs that die down as rain ceases or becomes too slight, to wait for\r\nanother opportunity to make the desert blossom into often gorgeous\r\ncoloring.\r\n\r\nRain forests, temperate forests, grassland, and deserts--all are immense\r\ndevelopments of plant societies depending upon climatic differences for\r\ntheir occurrence. There are some other plant communities which also\r\ndepend for their development on still other differences of climate. Two\r\nsuch are the vegetation of mountain tops in the tropics, and that\r\nstrange tundra vegetation near the poles which lives all its life on the\r\nice, only the roots and soil in which it grows thawing out during the\r\nbrief summer. Temperature rather than rainfall is the cause of these and\r\nsome other plant societies of more local occurrence.\r\n\r\nBut what of such well-known plant societies as bogs, in which peat is\r\nformed, or the plants growing along the sea beaches all over the world?\r\nThese, and scores of other plant communities play their part in the\r\ndistribution of plants, but nearly all of them depend not upon climate,\r\nbut upon usually purely local conditions of soil. Sandy, actually nearly\r\nsterile soil, the acidity of cranberry bogs, the alkaline regions in our\r\nown West, the salt lakes and inland seas, regions below sea level, the\r\nserpentine outcrops, all the hundred and one differences which local\r\nconditions exhibit--all these have a very direct bearing upon plant\r\ndistribution. It is impossible here to go into the details of the\r\ndifferent sorts of plant societies which inhabit such specialized\r\nplaces, nor into the truly wonderful adaptations of certain species to\r\npeculiar conditions. But in looking at the vegetation of regions through\r\nwhich one travels it must never be forgotten that its general type, such\r\nas forest, or grassland, or desert, or what not, is the result of\r\nusually widely operating climatic forces, while many, often quite\r\nextensive, plant societies in the region are the result of the local\r\nenvironment. There is often an active struggle as to the dominance of\r\nthe type dictated by the climate of the place, and the local conditions\r\nof soil that tend to nullify general response to it. On Long Island, New\r\nYork, for instance, there are areas which climatically should produce\r\ndense woods of the summer forest type so general all through the\r\nNortheastern States. Actually the water-worn sands and gravels that\r\ncovered the south side of the island in glacial times, are so poor in\r\nplant food, that many square miles of this region are now covered only\r\nby low scrub oaks and other plants suited to poor soils.\r\n\r\nA final word of caution is necessary to those who see in the foregoing\r\nbrief account of some of the chief causes of plant distribution an\r\nanswer to questions that many of us ask about why plants or vegetation\r\nare of such and such a kind in a particular locality. It has been\r\nconvenient--nay, it has been necessary--to consider these various\r\nfactors one by one, but the distribution of almost no individual, and\r\ncertainly of no widely spread plant community, is the result of any one\r\nof these factors operating singly.\r\n\r\nThe geological history of the region, the links with the past of the\r\nspecies composing the vegetation, the climate, the cooperation of\r\nvarious outside agencies in seed dispersal, the conflict of different\r\nspecies, and of different vegetation types, these and scores of other\r\nfactors, operating to-day, or having operated in the past--it is all\r\nthese that are reflected in the plant covering of the earth. The variety\r\nand beauty of that covering are too well understood to need further\r\nmention here. The extraordinary efforts that the plant world makes to\r\nkeep all but a minute fraction of the earth clothed with some sort of\r\nvegetation we have seen in the pages just turned. No other phase of the\r\nstudy of plant life is so replete with interest as plant distribution.\r\nRightly understood, it is a study, “the cultural, esthetic and practical\r\nvalue of which may well outweigh any other.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe have now traced, all too briefly and with the many omissions that\r\nsuch a general account as this makes necessary, the broad outlines of\r\nplant life. From the architecture of their outer characteristics, which\r\ntakes up the first chapter, we have gone step by step into the story of\r\nwhat goes on within the plant, and how it reproduces its kind. These\r\nactions or behavior of plants have resulted in many things of great\r\npractical importance as well as being of absorbing interest in\r\nthemselves. What some of these results have been, we see reflected in\r\nthe uses of plants to man, in the history of their development, and,\r\nmost of all, in the way they are distributed over the earth to-day.\r\n\r\nIf plants are still “just plants” to most readers, this book has been\r\nwritten in vain. Those who have gleaned from its pages some conception\r\nof what a fundamental thing plant life is, will doubtless want more\r\ninformation than could be included here.\r\n\r\nIf any considerable proportion of the readers of this volume feel that\r\nthey have already outgrown it, and that they have many questions about\r\nthe plant world for which they will have to go to more specialized works\r\nfor the answer, then this book has more than fulfilled its mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [1] After living probably as long as the Big Trees of California, the\r\n most famous dragon tree in the world was destroyed by a great storm.\r\n It has been replaced by seedlings.\r\n\r\n [2] A process recently discovered in England for extracting the fiber\r\n of this rush by a chemical bath has greatly increased the fiber\r\n possibilities of this common rush.
