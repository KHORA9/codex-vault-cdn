There are in\r\nit neither stirring events nor brilliant deeds to record; and as my\r\nMother was strongly averse to gossip, and to revelations of private life\r\nor of intimate correspondence, nothing of the kind will be found in the\r\nfollowing pages. It has been only after very great hesitation, and on\r\nthe recommendation of valued friends, who think that some account of so\r\nremarkable and beautiful a character cannot fail to interest the public,\r\nthat I have resolved to publish some detached Recollections of past\r\ntimes, noted down by my mother during the last years of her life,\r\ntogether with a few letters from eminent men and women, referring almost\r\nexclusively to her scientific works. A still smaller number of her own\r\nletters have been added, either as illustrating her opinions on events\r\nshe witnessed, or else as affording some slight idea of her simple and\r\nloving disposition.\r\n\r\nFew thoughtful minds will read without emotion my mother's own account\r\nof the wonderful energy and indomitable perseverance by which, in her\r\nardent thirst for knowledge, she overcame obstacles apparently\r\ninsurmountable, at a time when women were well-nigh totally debarred\r\nfrom education; and the almost intuitive way in which she entered upon\r\nstudies of which she had scarcely heard the names, living, as she did,\r\namong persons to whom they were utterly unknown, and who disapproved of\r\nher devotion to pursuits so different from those of ordinary young girls\r\nat the end of the last century, especially in Scotland, which was far\r\nmore old-fashioned and primitive than England.\r\n\r\nNor is her simple account of her early days without interest, when, as a\r\nlonely child, she wandered by the seashore, and on the links of\r\nBurntisland, collecting shells and flowers; or spent the clear, cold\r\nnights at her window, watching the starlit heavens, whose mysteries she\r\nwas destined one day to penetrate in all their profound and sublime\r\nlaws, making clear to others that knowledge which she herself had\r\nacquired, at the cost of so hard a struggle.\r\n\r\nIt was not only in her childhood and youth that my mother's studies\r\nencountered disapproval. Not till she became a widow, had she perfect\r\nfreedom to pursue them. The first person--indeed the only one in her\r\nearly days--who encouraged her passion for learning was her uncle by\r\nmarriage, afterwards her father-in-law, the Rev. Dr. Somerville,\r\nminister of Jedburgh, a man very much in advance of his century in\r\nliberality of thought on all subjects. He was one of the first to\r\ndiscern her rare qualities, and valued her as she deserved; while\r\nthrough life she retained the most grateful affection for him, and\r\nconfided to him many doubts and difficulties on subjects of the highest\r\nimportance. Nothing can be more erroneous than the statement, repeated\r\nin several obituary notices of my mother, that Mr. Greig (her first\r\nhusband) aided her in her mathematical and other pursuits. Nearly the\r\ncontrary was the case. Mr. Greig took no interest in science or\r\nliterature, and possessed in full the prejudice against learned women\r\nwhich was common at that time. Only on her marriage with my father, my\r\nmother at last met with one who entirely sympathised with her, and\r\nwarmly entered into all her ideas, encouraging her zeal for study to the\r\nutmost, and affording her every facility for it in his power. His love\r\nand admiration for her were unbounded; he frankly and willingly\r\nacknowledged her superiority to himself, and many of our friends can\r\nbear witness to the honest pride and gratification which he always\r\ntestified in the fame and honours she attained.\r\n\r\nNo one can escape sorrow, and my mother, in the course of her long life,\r\nhad her full share, but she bore it with that deep feeling of trust in\r\nthe great goodness of God which formed so marked a feature in her\r\ncharacter. She had a buoyant and hopeful spirit, and though her\r\naffections were very strong, and she felt keenly, it was ever her nature\r\nto turn from the shadows to all that is bright and beautiful in mortal\r\nlife. She had much to make life pleasant in the great honours\r\nuniversally bestowed upon her; but she found far more in the devoted\r\naffection of friends, to say nothing of those whose happy lot it has\r\nbeen to live in close and loving intercourse with so noble and gentle a\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nShe met with unbounded kindness from men of science of all countries,\r\nand most profound was her gratitude to them. Modest and unpretending to\r\nexcess, nothing could be more generous than the unfeigned delight she\r\nshewed in recognising the genius and discoveries of others; ever jealous\r\nof their fame, and never of her own.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to see persons who hold in youth opinions in advance\r\nof the age in which they live, but who at a certain period seem to\r\ncrystallise, and lose the faculty of comprehending and accepting new\r\nideas and theories; thus remaining at last as far behind, as they were\r\nonce in advance of public opinion. Not so my mother, who was ever ready\r\nto hail joyfully any new idea or theory, and to give it honest\r\nattention, even if it were at variance with her former convictions. This\r\nquality she never lost, and it enabled her to sympathise with the\r\nyounger generation of philosophers, as she had done with their\r\npredecessors, her own contemporaries.\r\n\r\nAlthough her favourite pursuit, and the one for which she had decidedly\r\nmost aptitude, was mathematics; yet there were few subjects in which she\r\ndid not take interest, whether in science or literature, philosophy or\r\npolitics. She was passionately fond of poetry, her especial favourites\r\nbeing Shakespeare and Dante, and also the great Greek dramatists, whose\r\ntragedies she read fluently in the original, being a good classical\r\nscholar. She was very fond of music, and devoted much time to it in her\r\nyouth, and she painted from nature with considerable taste. The latter\r\nwas, perhaps, the recreation in which she most delighted, from the\r\nopportunity it afforded her of contemplating the wonderful beauty of the\r\nworld, which was a never-failing source of intense enjoyment to her,\r\nwhether she watched the changing effects of light and shade on her\r\nfavourite Roman Campagna, or gazed, enchanted, on the gorgeous sunsets\r\non the bay of Naples, as she witnessed them from her much-loved\r\nSorrento, where she passed the last summers of her life. All things fair\r\nwere a joy to her--the flowers we brought her from our rambles, the\r\nsea-weeds, the wild birds she saw, all interested and pleased her.\r\nEverything in nature spoke to her of that great God who created all\r\nthings, the grand and sublimely beautiful as well as the exquisite\r\nloveliness of minute objects. Above all, in the laws which science\r\nunveils step by step, she found ever renewed motives for the love and\r\nadoration of their Author and Sustainer. This fervour of religious\r\nfeeling accompanied her through life, and very early she shook off all\r\nthat was dark and narrow in the creed of her first instructors for a\r\npurer and a happier faith.\r\n\r\nIt would be almost incredible were I to describe how much my mother\r\ncontrived to do in the course of the day. When my sister and I were\r\nsmall children, although busily engaged in writing for the press, she\r\nused to teach us for three hours every morning, besides managing her\r\nhouse carefully, reading the newspapers (for she always was a keen, and,\r\nI must add, a liberal politician), and the most important new books on\r\nall subjects, grave and gay. In addition to all this, she freely visited\r\nand received her friends. She was, indeed, very fond of society, and did\r\nnot look for transcendent talent in those with whom she associated,\r\nalthough no one appreciated it more when she found it. Gay and cheerful\r\ncompany was a pleasant relaxation after a hard day's work. My mother\r\nnever introduced scientific or learned subjects into general\r\nconversation. When they were brought forward by others, she talked\r\nsimply and naturally about them, without the slightest pretension to\r\nsuperior knowledge. Finally, to complete the list of her\r\naccomplishments, I must add that she was a remarkably neat and skilful\r\nneedlewoman. We still possess some elaborate specimens of her embroidery\r\nand lace-work.\r\n\r\nDevoted and loving in all the relations of life, my mother was ever\r\nforgetful of self. Indulgent and sympathising, she never judged others\r\nwith harshness or severity; yet she could be very angry when her\r\nindignation was aroused by hearing of injustice or oppression, of\r\ncruelty to man or beast, or of any attack on those she loved. Rather\r\ntimid and retiring in general society, she was otherwise fearless in her\r\nquiet way. I well remember her cool composure on some occasions when we\r\nwere in great danger. This she inherited from her father, Admiral Sir\r\nWilliam Fairfax, a gallant gentleman who distinguished himself greatly\r\nat the battle of Camperdown.[1]\r\n\r\nMy mother speaks of him as follows among her \"Recollections,\" of which I\r\nnow proceed to place some portions before the reader.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMy father was very good looking, of a brave and noble nature, and a\r\nperfect gentleman both in appearance and character. He was sent to sea\r\nas midshipman at ten years of age, so he had very little education; but\r\nhe read a great deal, chiefly history and voyages. He was very cool, and\r\nof instant resource in moments of danger.\r\n\r\nOne night, when his little vessel had taken refuge with many others from\r\nan intensely violent gale and drifting snow in Yarmouth Roads, they saw\r\nlights disappear, as vessel after vessel foundered. My father, after\r\nhaving done all that was possible for the safety of the ship, went to\r\nbed. His cabin door did not shut closely, from the rolling of the ship,\r\nand the man who was sentry that night told my mother years afterwards,\r\nthat when he saw my father on his knees praying, he thought it would\r\nsoon be all over with them; then seeing him go to bed and fall asleep,\r\nhe felt no more fear. In the morning the coast was strewed with wrecks.\r\nThere were no life-boats in those days; now the lives of hundreds are\r\nannually saved by the noble self-devotion of British sailors.\r\n\r\nMy mother was the daughter of Samuel Charters, Solicitor of the Customs\r\nfor Scotland, and his wife Christian Murray, of Kynynmont, whose eldest\r\nsister married the great grandfather of the present Earl of Minto. My\r\ngrandmother was exceedingly proud and stately. She made her children\r\nstand in her presence. My mother, on the contrary, was indulgent and\r\nkind, so that her children were perfectly at ease with her. She seldom\r\nread anything but the Bible, sermons, and the newspaper. She was very\r\nsincere and devout in her religion, and was remarkable for good sense\r\nand great strength of expression in writing and conversation. Though by\r\nno means pretty, she was exceedingly distinguished and ladylike both in\r\nappearance and manners.\r\n\r\nMy father was constantly employed, and twice distinguished himself by\r\nattacking vessels of superior force. He captured the first, but was\r\noverpowered by the second, and being taken to France, remained two years\r\na prisoner on parole, when he met with much kindness from the Choiseul\r\nfamily. At last he was exchanged, and afterwards was appointed\r\nlieutenant on board a frigate destined for foreign service. I think it\r\nwas the North American station, for the war of Independence was not over\r\ntill the beginning of 1783. As my mother knew that my father would be\r\nabsent for some years, she accompanied him to London, though so near her\r\nconfinement that in returning home she had just time to arrive at the\r\nmanse of Jedburgh, her sister Martha Somerville's[2] house, when I was\r\nborn, on the 26th December, 1780. My mother was dangerously ill, and my\r\naunt, who was about to wean her second daughter Janet, who married\r\nGeneral Henry Elliot, nursed me till a wetnurse could be found. So I was\r\nborn in the house of my future husband, and nursed by his mother--a\r\nrather singular coincidence.\r\n\r\nDuring my father's absence, my mother lived with great economy in a\r\nhouse not far from Burntisland which belonged to my grandfather, solely\r\noccupied with the care of her family, which consisted of her eldest son\r\nSamuel, four or five years old, and myself. One evening while my brother\r\nwas lying at play on the floor, he called out, \"O, mamma there's the\r\nmoon rinnin' awa.\" It was the celebrated meteor of 1783.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards, for what reason I do not know, my father and\r\nmother went to live for a short time at Inveresk, and thence returned to\r\nBurntisland, our permanent home.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [This place, in which my mother's early life was spent, exercised so\r\n    much influence on her life and pursuits, that I am happy to be\r\n    able to give the description of it in her own words.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBurntisland was then a small quiet seaport town with little or no\r\ncommerce, situated on the coast of Fife, immediately opposite to\r\nEdinburgh. It is sheltered at some distance on the north by a high and\r\nsteep hill called the Bin. The harbour lies on the west, and the town\r\nended on the east in a plain of short grass called the Links, on which\r\nthe townspeople had the right of pasturing their cows and geese. The\r\nLinks were bounded on each side by low hills covered with gorse and\r\nheather, and on the east by a beautiful bay with a sandy beach, which,\r\nbeginning at a low rocky point, formed a bow and then stretched for\r\nseveral miles to the town of Kinghorn, the distant part skirting a range\r\nof high precipitous crags.\r\n\r\nOur house, which lay to the south of the town, was very long, with a\r\nsouthern exposure, and its length was increased by a wall covered with\r\nfruit-trees, which concealed a courtyard, cow-house, and other offices.\r\nFrom this the garden extended southwards, and ended in a plot of short\r\ngrass covering a ledge of low black rocks washed by the sea. It was\r\ndivided into three parts by narrow, almost unfrequented, lanes. These\r\ngardens yielded abundance of common fruit and vegetables, but the\r\nwarmest and best exposures were always devoted to flowers. The garden\r\nnext to the house was bounded on the south by an ivy-covered wall hid by\r\na row of old elm trees, from whence a steep mossy bank descended to a\r\nflat plot of grass with a gravel walk and flower borders on each side,\r\nand a broad gravel walk ran along the front of the house. My mother was\r\nfond of flowers, and prided herself on her moss-roses, which flourished\r\nluxuriantly on the front of the house; but my father, though a sailor,\r\nwas an excellent florist. He procured the finest bulbs and flower seeds\r\nfrom Holland, and kept each kind in a separate bed.\r\n\r\nThe manners and customs of the people who inhabited this pretty spot at\r\nthat time were exceedingly primitive.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of any of the townspeople, a man went about ringing a\r\nbell at the doors of the friends and acquaintances of the person just\r\ndead, and, after calling out \"Oyez!\" three times, he announced the death\r\nwhich had occurred. This was still called by the name of the\r\nPassing-bell, which in Catholic times invited the prayers of the living\r\nfor the spirit just passed away.\r\n\r\nThere was much sympathy and kindness shown on these occasions; friends\r\nalways paid a visit of condolence to the afflicted, dressed in black.\r\nThe gude wives in Burntisland thought it respectable to provide\r\ndead-clothes for themselves and the \"gude man,\" that they might have a\r\ndecent funeral. I once saw a set of grave-clothes nicely folded up,\r\nwhich consisted of a long shirt and cap of white flannel, and a shroud\r\nof fine linen made of yarn, spun by the gude wife herself. I did not\r\nlike that gude wife; she was purse-proud, and took every opportunity of\r\ntreating with scorn a poor neighbour who had had a _misfortune_, that\r\nis, a child by her husband before marriage, but who made a very good\r\nwife. Her husband worked in our garden, and took our cow to the Links to\r\ngraze. The wife kept a little shop, where we bought things, and she told\r\nus her neighbour had given her \"mony a sair greet\"--that is, a bitter\r\nfit of weeping.\r\n\r\nThe howdie, or midwife, was a person of much consequence. She had often\r\nto go far into the country, by day and by night, riding a cart-horse.\r\nThe neighbours used to go and congratulate the mother, and, of course,\r\nto admire the baby. Cake and caudle were handed round, caudle being\r\noatmeal gruel, with sugar, nutmeg, and white wine. In the poorest class,\r\nhot ale and \"scons\" were offered.\r\n\r\nPenny-weddings were by no means uncommon in my young days. When a very\r\npoor couple were going to be married, the best man, and even the\r\nbridegroom himself, went from house to house, asking for small sums to\r\nenable them to have a wedding supper, and pay the town fiddler for a\r\ndance; any one was admitted who paid a penny. I recollect the prisoners\r\nin the Tolbooth letting down bags from the prison windows, begging for\r\ncharity. I do not remember any execution taking place.\r\n\r\nMen and old women of the lower classes smoked tobacco in short pipes,\r\nand many took snuff--even young ladies must have done so; for I have a\r\nvery pretty and quaint gold snuff-box which was given to my grandmother\r\nas a marriage present. Licensed beggars, called \"gaberlunzie men,\" were\r\nstill common. They wore a blue coat, with a tin badge, and wandered\r\nabout the country, knew all that was going on, and were always welcome\r\nat the farm-houses, where the gude wife liked to have a crack (gossip)\r\nwith the blue coat, and, in return for his news, gave him dinner or\r\nsupper, as might be. Edie Ochiltree is a perfect specimen of this\r\nextinct race. There was another species of beggar, of yet higher\r\nantiquity. If a man were a cripple, and poor, his relations put him in a\r\nhand-barrow, and wheeled him to their next neighbour's door, and left\r\nhim there. Some one came out, gave him oat-cake or peasemeal bannock,\r\nand then wheeled him to the next door; and in this way, going from house\r\nto house, he obtained a fair livelihood.\r\n\r\nMy brother Sam lived with our grandfather in Edinburgh, and attended the\r\nHigh School, which was in the old town, and, like other boys, he was\r\ngiven pennies to buy bread; but the boys preferred oysters, which they\r\nbought from the fishwives, the bargain being, a dozen oysters for a\r\nhalfpenny, and a kiss for the thirteenth. These fishwives and their\r\nhusbands were industrious, hard-working people, forming a community of\r\ntheir own in the village of Newhaven, close to the sea, and about two\r\nmiles from Edinburgh. The men were exposed to cold, and often to danger,\r\nin their small boats, not always well-built nor fitted for our stormy\r\nFirth. The women helped to land and prepare the fish when the boats came\r\nin, carried it to town for sale in the early morning, kept the purse,\r\nmanaged the house, brought up the children, and provided food and\r\nclothing for all. Many were rich, lived well, and sometimes had dances.\r\nMany of the young women were pretty, and all wore--and, I am told, still\r\nwear--a bright-coloured, picturesque costume. Some young men, amongst\r\nothers a cousin of my own, who attempted to intrude into one of these\r\nballs, got pelted with fish offal by the women. The village smelt\r\nstrongly of fish, certainly; yet the people were very clean personally.\r\nI recollect their keeping tame gulls, which they fed with fish offal.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no individual enmity between the boys of the old and\r\nof the new or aristocratic part of Edinburgh, there were frequent\r\nbattles, called \"bickers,\" between them, in which they pelted each other\r\nwith stones. Sometimes they were joined by bigger lads, and then the\r\nfight became so serious that the magistrates sent the city guard--a set\r\nof old men with halberds and a quaint uniform--to separate them; but no\r\nsooner did the guard appear, than both parties joined against them.\r\n\r\nStrings of wild geese were common in autumn, and I was amused on one\r\noccasion to see the clumsy tame fat geese which were feeding on the\r\nLinks rise in a body and try to follow the wild ones.\r\n\r\nAs the grass on the plot before our house did not form a fine even turf,\r\nthe ground was trenched and sown with good seed, but along with the\r\ngrass a vast crop of thistles and groundsel appeared, which attracted\r\nquantities of goldfinches, and in the early mornings I have seen as many\r\nas sixty to eighty of these beautiful birds feeding on it.\r\n\r\nMy love of birds has continued through life, for only two years ago, in\r\nmy extreme old age, I lost a pet mountain sparrow, which for eight years\r\nwas my constant companion: sitting on my shoulder, pecking at my\r\npapers, and eating out of my mouth; and I am not ashamed to say I felt\r\nits accidental death very much.\r\n\r\nBefore the grass came up on this plot of ground, its surface in the\r\nevening swarmed with earthworms, which instantly shrank into their holes\r\non the approach of a foot. My aunt Janet, who was then with us, and\r\nafraid even to speak of death, was horrified on seeing them, firmly\r\nbelieving that she would one day be eaten by them--a very general\r\nopinion at that time; few people being then aware that the finest mould\r\nin our gardens and fields has passed through the entrails of the\r\nearthworm, the vegetable juices it contains being sufficient to maintain\r\nthese harmless creatures.\r\n\r\nMy mother was very much afraid of thunder and lightning. She knew when a\r\nstorm was near from the appearance of the clouds, and prepared for it by\r\ntaking out the steel pins which fastened her cap on. She then sat on a\r\nsofa at a distance from the fire-place, which had a very high chimney,\r\nand read different parts of the Bible, especially the sublime\r\ndescriptions of storms in the Psalms, which made me, who sat close by\r\nher, still more afraid. We had an excellent and beautiful pointer,\r\ncalled Hero, a great favourite, who generally lived in the garden, but\r\nat the first clap of thunder he used to rush howling indoors, and place\r\nhis face on my knee. Then my father, who laughed not a little at our\r\nfear, would bring a glass of wine to my mother, and say, \"Drink that,\r\nPeg; it will give you courage, for we are going to have a rat-tat-too.\"\r\nMy mother would beg him to shut the window-shutters, and though she\r\ncould no longer see to read, she kept the Bible on her knee for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nMy mother taught me to read the Bible, and to say my prayers morning and\r\nevening; otherwise she allowed me to grow up a wild creature. When I was\r\nseven or eight years old I began to be useful, for I pulled the fruit\r\nfor preserving; shelled the peas and beans, fed the poultry, and looked\r\nafter the dairy, for we kept a cow.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I had put green gooseberries into bottles and sent them\r\nto the kitchen with orders to the cook to boil the bottles uncorked,\r\nand, when the fruit was sufficiently cooked, to cork and tie up the\r\nbottles. After a time all the house was alarmed by loud explosions and\r\nviolent screaming in the kitchen, the cook had corked the bottles before\r\nshe boiled them, and of course they exploded. For greater preservation,\r\nthe bottles were always buried in the ground; a number were once found\r\nin our garden with the fruit in high preservation which had been buried\r\nno one knew when. Thus experience is sometimes the antecedent of\r\nscience, for it was little suspected at that time that by shutting out\r\nthe air the invisible organic world was excluded--the cause of all\r\nfermentation and decay.\r\n\r\nI never cared for dolls, and had no one to play with me. I amused myself\r\nin the garden, which was much frequented by birds. I knew most of them,\r\ntheir flight and their habits. The swallows were never prevented from\r\nbuilding above our windows, and, when about to migrate, they used to\r\nassemble in hundreds on the roof of our house, and prepared for their\r\njourney by short flights. We fed the birds when the ground was covered\r\nwith snow, and opened our windows at breakfast-time to let in the\r\nrobins, who would hop on the table to pick up crumbs. The quantity of\r\nsinging birds was very great, for the farmers and gardeners were less\r\ncruel and avaricious than they are now--though poorer. They allowed our\r\npretty songsters to share in the bounties of providence. The\r\nshortsighted cruelty, which is too prevalent now, brings its own\r\npunishment, for, owing to the reckless destruction of birds, the\r\nequilibrium of nature is disturbed, insects increase to such an extent\r\nas materially to affect every description of crop. This summer (1872),\r\nwhen I was at Sorrento, even the olives, grapes, and oranges were\r\nseriously injured by the caterpillars--a disaster which I entirely\r\nattribute to the ruthless havoc made among every kind of bird.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMy mother set me in due time to learn the catechism of the Kirk of\r\nScotland, and to attend the public examinations in the kirk. This was a\r\nsevere trial for me; for, besides being timid and shy, I had a bad\r\nmemory, and did not understand one word of the catechism. These\r\nmeetings, which began with prayer, were attended by all the children of\r\nthe town and neighbourhood, with their mothers, and a great many old\r\nwomen, who came to be edified. They were an acute race, and could quote\r\nchapter and verse of Scripture as accurately as the minister himself. I\r\nremember he said to one of them--\"Peggie, what lightened the world\r\nbefore the sun was made?\" After thinking for a minute, she said--\"'Deed,\r\nsir, the question is mair curious than edifying.\"\r\n\r\nBesides these public examinations, the minister made an annual visit to\r\neach household in his parish. When he came to us, the servants were\r\ncalled in, and we all knelt while he said a prayer; and then he examined\r\neach individual as to the state of his soul and conduct. He asked me if\r\nI could say my \"Questions\"--that is, the catechism of the Kirk of\r\nScotland--and asked a question at random to ascertain the fact. He did\r\nthe same to the servants.\r\n\r\nWhen I was between eight and nine years old, my father came home from\r\nsea, and was shocked to find me such a savage. I had not yet been taught\r\nto write, and although I amused myself reading the \"Arabian Nights,\"\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe,\" and the \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" I read very badly, and\r\nwith a strong Scotch accent; so, besides a chapter of the Bible, he made\r\nme read a paper of the \"Spectator\" aloud every morning, after breakfast;\r\nthe consequence of which discipline is that I have never since opened\r\nthat book. Hume's \"History of England\" was also a real penance to me. I\r\ngladly accompanied my father when he cultivated his flowers, which even\r\nnow I can say were of the best quality. The tulips and other bulbous\r\nplants, ranunculi, anemones, carnations, as well as the annuals then\r\nknown, were all beautiful. He used to root up and throw away many plants\r\nI thought very beautiful; he said he did so because the colours of their\r\npetals were not sharply defined, and that they would spoil the seed of\r\nthe others. Thus I learnt to know the good and the bad--how to lay\r\ncarnations, and how to distinguish between the leaf and fruit buds in\r\npruning fruit trees; this kind of knowledge was of no practical use,\r\nfor, as my after-life was spent in towns, I never had a garden, to my\r\ngreat regret.\r\n\r\nGeorge the Third was so popular, that even in Burntisland nosegays were\r\nplaced in every window on the 4th of June, his birthday; and it\r\noccasionally happened that our garden was robbed the preceding night of\r\nits gayest flowers.\r\n\r\nMy father at last said to my mother,--\"This kind of life will never do,\r\nMary must at least know how to write and keep accounts.\" So at ten years\r\nold I was sent to a boarding-school, kept by a Miss Primrose, at\r\nMusselburgh, where I was utterly wretched. The change from perfect\r\nliberty to perpetual restraint was in itself a great trial; besides,\r\nbeing naturally shy and timid, I was afraid of strangers, and although\r\nMiss Primrose was not unkind she had an habitual frown, which even the\r\nelder girls dreaded. My future companions, who were all older than I,\r\ncame round me like a swarm of bees, and asked if my father had a title,\r\nwhat was the name of our estate, if we kept a carriage, and other such\r\nquestions, which made me first feel the difference of station. However,\r\nthe girls were very kind, and often bathed my eyes to prevent our stern\r\nmistress from seeing that I was perpetually in tears. A few days after\r\nmy arrival, although perfectly straight and well-made, I was enclosed in\r\nstiff stays with a steel busk in front, while, above my frock, bands\r\ndrew my shoulders back till the shoulder-blades met. Then a steel rod,\r\nwith a semi-circle which went under the chin, was clasped to the steel\r\nbusk in my stays. In this constrained state I, and most of the younger\r\ngirls, had to prepare our lessons. The chief thing I had to do was to\r\nlearn by heart a page of Johnson's dictionary, not only to spell the\r\nwords, give their parts of speech and meaning, but as an exercise of\r\nmemory to remember their order of succession. Besides I had to learn the\r\nfirst principles of writing, and the rudiments of French and English\r\ngrammar. The method of teaching was extremely tedious and inefficient.\r\nOur religious duties were attended to in a remarkable way. Some of the\r\ngirls were Presbyterians, others belonged to the Church of England, so\r\nMiss Primrose cut the matter short by taking us all to the kirk in the\r\nmorning and to church in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nIn our play-hours we amused ourselves with playing at ball, marbles, and\r\nespecially at \"Scotch and English,\" a game which represented a raid on\r\nthe debatable land, or Border between Scotland and England, in which\r\neach party tried to rob the other of their playthings. The little ones\r\nwere always compelled to be English, for the bigger girls thought it too\r\ndegrading.\r\n\r\nLady Hope, a relative of my mother, frequently invited me to spend\r\nSaturday at Pinkie. She was a very ladylike person, in delicate health,\r\nand with cold manners. Sir Archibald was stout, loud, passionate, and\r\ndevoted to hunting. I amused myself in the grounds, a good deal afraid\r\nof a turkey-cock, who was pugnacious and defiant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sir William Fairfax was the son of Joseph Fairfax, Esq., of\r\nBagshot, in the county of Surrey, who died in 1783, aged 77, having\r\nserved in the army previous to 1745.

Dr. Thomas Somerville, minister of\r\nJedburgh, already mentioned (p. 2).

After this prolonged and elaborate\r\n    education, she was recalled to Burntisland, and the results of the\r\n    process she had undergone are detailed in her \"Recollections\" with\r\n    much drollery.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSoon after my return home I received a note from a lady in the\r\nneighbourhood, inquiring for my mother, who had been ill. This note\r\ngreatly distressed me, for my half-text writing was as bad as possible,\r\nand I could neither compose an answer nor spell the words. My eldest\r\ncousin, Miss Somerville, a grown-up young lady, then with us, got me out\r\nof this scrape, but I soon got myself into another, by writing to my\r\nbrother in Edinburgh that I had sent him a bank-_knot_ (note) to buy\r\nsomething for me. The school at Musselburgh was expensive, and I was\r\nreproached with having cost so much money in vain. My mother said she\r\nwould have been contented if I had only learnt to write well and keep\r\naccounts, which was all that a woman was expected to know.\r\n\r\nThis passed over, and I was like a wild animal escaped out of a cage. I\r\nwas no longer amused in the gardens, but wandered about the country.\r\nWhen the tide was out I spent hours on the sands, looking at the\r\nstar-fish and sea-urchins, or watching the children digging for\r\nsand-eels, cockles, and the spouting razor-fish. I made a collection of\r\nshells, such as were cast ashore, some so small that they appeared like\r\nwhite specks in patches of black sand. There was a small pier on the\r\nsands for shipping limestone brought from the coal mines inland. I was\r\nastonished to see the surface of these blocks of stone covered with\r\nbeautiful impressions of what seemed to be leaves; how they got there I\r\ncould not imagine, but I picked up the broken bits, and even large\r\npieces, and brought them to my repository. I knew the eggs of many\r\nbirds, and made a collection of them. I never robbed a nest, but bought\r\nstrings of eggs, which were sold by boys, besides getting sea-fowl eggs\r\nfrom sailors who had been in whalers or on other northern voyages. It\r\nwas believed by these sailors that there was a gigantic flat fish in the\r\nNorth Sea, called a kraken. It was so enormous that when it came to the\r\nsurface, covered with tangles and sand, it was supposed to be an island,\r\ntill, on one occasion, part of a ship's crew landed on it and found out\r\ntheir mistake. However, much as they believed in it, none of the sailors\r\nat Burntisland had ever seen it. The sea serpent was also an article of\r\nour faith.\r\n\r\nIn the rocks at the end of our garden there was a shingly opening, in\r\nwhich we used to bathe, and where at low tide I frequently waded among\r\nmasses of rock covered with sea-weeds. With the exception of dulse and\r\ntangle I knew the names of none, though I was well acquainted with and\r\nadmired many of these beautiful plants. I also watched the crabs, live\r\nshells, jelly-fish, and various marine animals, all of which were\r\nobjects of curiosity and amusement to me in my lonely life.\r\n\r\nThe flora on the links and hills around was very beautiful, and I soon\r\nlearnt the trivial names of all the plants. There was not a tree nor\r\nbush higher than furze in this part of the country, but the coast to the\r\nnorth-west of Burntisland was bordered by a tree and brushwood-covered\r\nbank belonging to the Earl of Morton, which extended to Aberdour. I\r\ncould not go so far alone, but had frequent opportunities of walking\r\nthere and gathering ferns, foxgloves, and primroses, which grew on the\r\nmossy banks of a little stream that ran into the sea. The bed of this\r\nstream or burn was thickly covered with the freshwater mussel, which I\r\nknew often contained pearls, but I did not like to kill the creatures to\r\nget the pearls.\r\n\r\nOne day my father, who was a keen sportsman, having gone to fish for red\r\ntrout at the mouth of this stream, found a young whale, or grampus,\r\nstranded in the shallow water. He immediately ran back to the town, got\r\nboats, captured the whale, and landed it in the harbour, where I went\r\nwith the rest of the crowd to see the _muckle fish_.\r\n\r\nThere was always a good deal of shipbuilding carried on in the harbour,\r\ngenerally coasting vessels or colliers. We, of course, went to see them\r\nlaunched, which was a pretty sight.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhen the bad weather began I did not know what to do with myself.\r\nFortunately we had a small collection of books, among which I found\r\nShakespeare, and read it at every moment I could spare from my domestic\r\nduties. These occupied a great part of my time; besides, I had to _shew_\r\n(sew) my sampler, working the alphabet from A to Z, as well as the ten\r\nnumbers, on canvas.\r\n\r\nMy mother did not prevent me from reading, but my aunt Janet, who came\r\nto live in Burntisland after her father's death, greatly disapproved of\r\nmy conduct. She was an old maid who could be very agreeable and witty,\r\nbut she had all the prejudices of the time with regard to women's\r\nduties, and said to my mother, \"I wonder you let Mary waste her time in\r\nreading, she never _shews_ (sews) more than if she were a man.\"\r\nWhereupon I was sent to the village school to learn plain needlework. I\r\ndo not remember how long it was after this that an old lady sent some\r\nvery fine linen to be made into shirts for her brother, and desired that\r\none should be made entirely by me. This shirt was so well worked that I\r\nwas relieved from attending the school, but the house linen was given\r\ninto my charge to make and to mend. We had a large stock, much of it\r\nvery beautiful, for the Scotch ladies at that time were very proud of\r\ntheir napery, but they no longer sent it to Holland to be bleached, as\r\nhad once been the custom. We grew flax, and our maids spun it. The\r\ncoarser yarn was woven in Burntisland, and bleached upon the links; the\r\nfiner was sent to Dunfermline, where there was a manufactory of\r\ntable-linen.\r\n\r\nI was annoyed that my turn for reading was so much disapproved of, and\r\nthought it unjust that women should have been given a desire for\r\nknowledge if it were wrong to acquire it. Among our books I found\r\nChapone's \"Letters to Young Women,\" and resolved to follow the course of\r\nhistory there recommended, the more so as we had most of the works she\r\nmentions. One, however, which my cousin lent me was in French, and here\r\nthe little I had learnt at school was useful, for with the help of a\r\ndictionary I made out the sense. What annoyed me was my memory not being\r\ngood--I could remember neither names nor dates. Years afterwards I\r\nstudied a \"Memoria Technica,\" then in fashion, without success; yet in\r\nmy youth I could play long pieces of music on the piano without the\r\nbook, and I never forget mathematical formulæ. In looking over one of my\r\nMSS., which I had not seen for forty years, I at once recognised the\r\nformulæ for computing the secular inequalities of the moon.\r\n\r\nWe had two small globes, and my mother allowed me to learn the use of\r\nthem from Mr. Reed, the village schoolmaster, who came to teach me for a\r\nfew weeks in the winter evenings. Besides the ordinary branches, Mr.\r\nReed taught Latin and navigation, but these were out of the question for\r\nme. At the village school the boys often learnt Latin, but it was\r\nthought sufficient for the girls to be able to read the Bible; very few\r\neven learnt writing. I recollect, however, that some men were ignorant\r\nof book-keeping; our baker, for instance had a wooden tally, in which\r\nhe made a notch for every loaf of bread, and of course we had the\r\ncorresponding tally. They were called nick-sticks.\r\n\r\nMy bedroom had a window to the south, and a small closet near had one to\r\nthe north. At these I spent many hours, studying the stars by the aid of\r\nthe celestial globe. Although I watched and admired the magnificent\r\ndisplays of the Aurora, which frequently occurred, they seemed to be so\r\nnearly allied to lightning that I was somewhat afraid of them. At an\r\nearlier period of my life there was a comet, which I dreaded\r\nexceedingly.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMy father was Captain of the \"Repulse,\" a fifty-gun ship, attached to\r\nthe Northern fleet commanded by the Earl of Northesk. The winter was\r\nextremely stormy, the fleet was driven far north, and kept there by\r\nadverse gales, till both officers and crew were on short rations. They\r\nran out of candles, and had to tear up their stockings for wicks, and\r\ndip them into the fat of the salt meat which was left. We were in great\r\nanxiety, for it was reported that some of the ships had foundered; we\r\nwere, however, relieved by the arrival of the \"Repulse\" in Leith roads\r\nfor repair.\r\n\r\nOur house on one occasion being full, I was sent to sleep in a room\r\nquite detached from the rest and with a different staircase. There was\r\na closet in this room in which my father kept his fowling pieces,\r\nfishing tackle, and golf clubs, and a long garret overhead was filled\r\nwith presses and stores of all kinds, among other things a number of\r\nlarge cheeses were on a board slung by ropes to the rafters. One night I\r\nhad put out my candle and was fast asleep, when I was awakened by a\r\nviolent crash, and then a rolling noise over my head. Now the room was\r\nsaid to be haunted, so that the servants would not sleep in it. I was\r\ndesperate, for there was no bell. I groped my way to the closet--lucifer\r\nmatches were unknown in those days--I seized one of the golf clubs,\r\nwhich are shod with iron, and thundered on the bedroom door till I\r\nbrought my father, followed by the whole household, to my aid. It was\r\nfound that the rats had gnawed through the ropes by which the cheeses\r\nwere suspended, so that the crash and rolling were accounted for, and I\r\nwas scolded for making such an uproar.\r\n\r\nChildren suffer much misery by being left alone in the dark. When I was\r\nvery young I was sent to bed at eight or nine o'clock, and the maid who\r\nslept in the room went away as soon as I was in bed, leaving me alone in\r\nthe dark till she came to bed herself. All that time I was in an agony\r\nof fear of something indefinite, I could not tell what. The joy, the\r\nrelief, when the maid came back, were such that I instantly fell asleep.\r\nNow that I am a widow and old, although I always have a night-lamp, such\r\nis the power of early impressions that I rejoice when daylight comes.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt Burntisland the sacrament was administered in summer because people\r\ncame in crowds from the neighbouring parishes to attend the preachings.\r\nThe service was long and fatiguing. A number of clergymen came to\r\nassist, and as the minister's manse could not accommodate them all, we\r\nentertained three of them, one of whom was always the Rev. Dr. Campbell,\r\nfather of Lord Campbell.\r\n\r\nThursday was a day of preparation. The morning service began by a psalm\r\nsung by the congregation, then a prayer was said by the minister,\r\nfollowed by a lecture on some chapter of the Bible, generally lasting an\r\nhour, after that another psalm was sung, followed by a prayer, a sermon\r\nwhich lasted seldom less than an hour, and the whole ended with a psalm,\r\na short prayer and a benediction. Every one then went home to dinner and\r\nreturned afterwards for afternoon service, which lasted more than an\r\nhour and a half. Friday was a day of rest, but I together with many\r\nyoung people went at this time to the minister to receive a stamped\r\npiece of lead as a token that we were sufficiently instructed to be\r\nadmitted to Christ's table. This ticket was given to the Elder on the\r\nfollowing Sunday. On Saturday there was a morning service, and on Sunday\r\nsuch multitudes came to receive the sacrament that the devotions\r\ncontinued till late in the evening. The ceremony was very strikingly and\r\nsolemnly conducted. The communicants sat on each side of long narrow\r\ntables covered with white linen, in imitation of the last supper of\r\nChrist, and the Elders handed the bread and wine. After a short\r\nexhortation from one of the ministers the first set retired, and were\r\nsucceeded by others. When the weather was fine a sermon, prayers, and\r\npsalm-singing took place either in the churchyard or on a grassy bank at\r\nthe Links for such as were waiting to communicate. On the Monday morning\r\nthere was the same long service as on the Thursday. It was too much for\r\nme; I always came home with a headache, and took a dislike to sermons.\r\n\r\nOur minister was a rigid Calvinist. His sermons were gloomy, and so long\r\nthat he occasionally would startle the congregation by calling out to\r\nsome culprit, \"Sit up there, how daur ye sleep i' the kirk.\" Some\r\nsaw-mills in the neighbourhood were burnt down, so the following Sunday\r\nwe had a sermon on hell-fire. The kirk was very large and quaint; a\r\nstair led to a gallery on each side of the pulpit, which was intended\r\nfor the tradespeople, and each division was marked with a suitable\r\ndevice, and text from Scripture. On the bakers' portion a sheaf of wheat\r\nwas painted; a balance and weights on the grocers', and on the weavers',\r\nwhich was opposite to our pew, there was a shuttle, and below it the\r\nmotto, \"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent\r\nwithout _hop job_.\" The artist was evidently no clerk.\r\n\r\nMy brother Sam, while attending the university in Edinburgh, came to us\r\non the Saturdays and returned to town on Monday. He of course went with\r\nus to the kirk on Sunday morning, but we let our mother attend afternoon\r\nservice alone, as he and I were happy to be together, and we spent the\r\ntime sitting on the grassy rocks at the foot of our garden, from whence\r\nwe could see a vast extent of the Firth of Forth with Edinburgh and its\r\npicturesque hills. It was very amusing, for we occasionally saw three or\r\nfour whales spouting, and shoals of porpoises at play. However, we did\r\nnot escape reproof, for I recollect the servant coming to tell us that\r\nthe minister had sent to inquire whether Mr. and Miss Fairfax had been\r\ntaken ill, as he had not seen them at the kirk in the afternoon. The\r\nminister in question was Mr. Wemyss, who had married a younger sister of\r\nmy mother's.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhen I was about thirteen my mother took a small apartment in Edinburgh\r\nfor the winter, and I was sent to a writing school, where I soon learnt\r\nto write a good hand, and studied the common rules of arithmetic. My\r\nuncle William Henry Charters, lately returned from India, gave me a\r\npianoforte, and I had music lessons from an old lady who lived in the\r\ntop story of one of the highest houses in the old town. I slept in the\r\nsame room with my mother. One morning I called out, much alarmed, \"There\r\nis lightning!\" but my mother said, after a moment, \"No; it is fire!\" and\r\non opening the window shutters I found that the flakes of fire flying\r\npast had made the glass quite hot. The next house but one was on fire\r\nand burning fiercely, and the people next door were throwing everything\r\nthey possessed, even china and glass, out of the windows into the\r\nstreet. We dressed quickly, and my mother sent immediately to Trotter\r\nthe upholsterer for four men. We then put our family papers, our silver,\r\n&c., &c., into trunks; then my mother said, \"Now let us breakfast, it is\r\ntime enough for us to move our things when the next house takes fire.\"\r\nOf its doing so there was every probability because casks of turpentine\r\nand oil were exploding from time to time in a carriage manufactory at\r\nthe back of it. Several gentlemen of our acquaintance who came to assist\r\nus were surprised to find us breakfasting quietly as if there were\r\nnothing unusual going on. In fact my mother, though a coward in many\r\nthings, had, like most women, the presence of mind and the courage of\r\nnecessity. The fire was extinguished, and we had only the four men to\r\npay for doing nothing, nor did we sacrifice any of our property like our\r\nneighbours who had completely lost their heads from terror. I may\r\nmention here that on one occasion when my father was at home he had been\r\nill with a severe cold, and wore his nightcap. While reading in the\r\ndrawing-room one evening he called out, \"I smell fire, there is no time\r\nto be lost,\" so, snatching up a candle, he wandered from room to room\r\nfollowed by us all still smelling fire, when one of the servants said,\r\n\"O, sir, it is the tassel of your nightcap that is on fire.\"\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn returning to Burntisland, I spent four or five hours daily at the\r\npiano; and for the sake of having something to do, I taught myself Latin\r\nenough from such books as we had, to read Cæsar's \"Commentaries.\" I\r\nwent that summer on a visit to my aunt at Jedburgh, and, for the first\r\ntime in my life, I met in my uncle, Dr. Somerville, with a friend who\r\napproved of my thirst for knowledge. During long walks with him in the\r\nearly mornings, he was so kind, that I had the courage to tell him that\r\nI had been trying to learn Latin, but I feared it was in vain; for my\r\nbrother and other boys, superior to me in talent, and with every\r\nassistance, spent years in learning it. He assured me, on the contrary,\r\nthat in ancient times many women--some of them of the highest rank in\r\nEngland--had been very elegant scholars, and that he would read Virgil\r\nwith me if I would come to his study for an hour or two every morning\r\nbefore breakfast, which I gladly did.\r\n\r\nI never was happier in my life than during the months I spent at\r\nJedburgh. My aunt was a charming companion--witty, full of anecdote, and\r\nhad read more than most women of her day, especially Shakespeare, who\r\nwas her favourite author. My cousins had little turn for reading, but\r\nthey were better educated than most girls. They were taught to write by\r\nDavid Brewster, son of the village schoolmaster, afterwards Sir David,\r\nwho became one of the most distinguished philosophers and discoverers of\r\nthe age, member of all the scientific societies at home and abroad, and\r\nat last President of the University of Edinburgh. He was studying in\r\nEdinburgh when I was at Jedburgh; so I did not make his acquaintance\r\nthen; but later in life he became my valued friend. I did not know till\r\nafter his death, that, while teaching my cousins, he fell in love with\r\nmy cousin Margaret. I do not believe she was aware of it. She was\r\nafterwards attached to an officer in the army; but my aunt would not\r\nallow her to go to that _outlandish_ place, Malta, where he was\r\nquartered; so she lived and died unmarried. Steam has changed our ideas\r\nof distance since that time.\r\n\r\nMy uncle's house--the manse--in which I was born, stands in a pretty\r\ngarden, bounded by the fine ancient abbey, which, though partially\r\nruined, still serves as the parish kirk. The garden produced abundance\r\nof common flowers, vegetables, and fruit. Some of the plum and pear\r\ntrees were very old, and were said to have been planted by the monks.\r\nBoth were excellent in quality, and very productive. The view from both\r\ngarden and manse was over the beautiful narrow valley through which the\r\nJed flows. The precipitous banks of red sandstone are richly clothed\r\nwith vegetation, some of the trees ancient and very fine, especially the\r\nmagnificent one called the capon tree, and the lofty king of the wood,\r\nremnants of the fine forests which at one time had covered the country.\r\nAn inland scene was new to me, and I was never tired of admiring the\r\ntree-crowned scaurs or precipices, where the rich glow of the red\r\nsandstone harmonized so well with the autumnal tints of the foliage.\r\n\r\nWe often bathed in the pure stream of the Jed. My aunt always went with\r\nus, and was the merriest of the party; we bathed in a pool which was\r\ndeep under the high scaur, but sloped gradually from the grassy bank on\r\nthe other side. Quiet and transparent as the Jed was, it one day came\r\ndown with irresistible fury, red with the débris of the sandstone\r\nscaurs. There had been a thunderstorm in the hills up-stream, and as\r\nsoon as the river began to rise, the people came out with pitchforks and\r\nhooks to catch the hayricks, sheaves of corn, drowned pigs, and other\r\nanimals that came sweeping past. My cousins and I were standing on the\r\nbridge, but my aunt called us off when the water rose above the arches,\r\nfor fear of the bridge giving way. We made expeditions every day;\r\nsometimes we went nutting in the forest; at other times we gathered\r\nmushrooms on the grass parks of Stewartfield, where there was a wood of\r\npicturesque old Scotch firs, inhabited by a colony of rooks. I still\r\nkept the habit of looking out for birds, and had the good fortune to\r\nsee a heron, now a rare bird in the valley of the Jed. Some of us went\r\nevery day to a spring called the Allerly well, about a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the manse, and brought a large jug of its sparkling water for\r\ndinner. The evenings were cheerful; my aunt sang Scotch songs prettily,\r\nand told us stories and legends about Jedburgh, which had been a royal\r\nresidence in the olden time. She had a tame white and tawny-coloured\r\nowl, which we fed every night, and sometimes brought into the\r\ndrawing-room. The Sunday evening never was gloomy, though properly\r\nobserved. We occasionally drank tea with acquaintances, and made visits\r\nof a few days to the Rutherfurds of Edgerton and others; but I was\r\nalways glad to return to the manse.\r\n\r\nMy uncle, like other ministers of the Scottish Kirk, was allowed a\r\nglebe, which he farmed himself. Besides horses, a cow was kept, which\r\nsupplied the family with cream and butter, and the skimmed milk was\r\ngiven to the poor; but as the milk became scarce, one woman was\r\ndeprived, for the time, of her share. Soon after, the cow was taken ill,\r\nand my uncle's ploughman, Will, came to him and said, \"Sir, gin you\r\nwould give that carline Tibby Jones her soup o' milk again, the coo\r\nwould soon be weel eneugh.\" Will was by no means the only believer in\r\nwitchcraft at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH--YOUTHFUL STUDIES AND AMUSEMENTS--POLITICS--THE THEATRES OF\r\nTHE TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [My mother's next visit was to the house of her uncle, William\r\n    Charters, in Edinburgh. From thence she was enabled to partake of\r\n    the advantages of a dancing-school of the period.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThey sent me to Strange's dancing school. Strange himself was exactly\r\nlike a figure on the stage; tall and thin, he wore a powdered wig, with\r\ncannons at the ears, and a pigtail. Ruffles at the breast and wrists,\r\nwhite waistcoat, black silk or velvet shorts, white silk stockings,\r\nlarge silver buckles, and a pale blue coat completed his costume. He had\r\na little fiddle on which he played, called a kit. My first lesson was\r\nhow to walk and make a curtsey. \"Young lady, if you visit the queen you\r\nmust make three curtsies, lower and lower and lower as you approach her.\r\nSo--o--o,\" leading me on and making me curtsey. \"Now, if the queen were\r\nto ask you to eat a bit of mutton with her, what would you say?\" Every\r\nSaturday afternoon all the scholars, both boys and girls, met to\r\npractise in the public assembly rooms in George's Street. It was a\r\nhandsome large hall with benches rising like an amphitheatre. Some of\r\nthe elder girls were very pretty, and danced well, so these practisings\r\nbecame a lounge for officers from the Castle, and other young men. We\r\nused always to go in full evening dress. We learnt the _minuet de la\r\ncour_, reels and country dances. Our partners used to give us\r\ngingerbread and oranges. Dancing before so many people was quite an\r\nexhibition, and I was greatly mortified one day when ready to begin a\r\nminuet, by the dancing-master shaking me roughly and making me hold out\r\nmy frock properly.\r\n\r\nThough kind in the main, my uncle and his wife were rather sarcastic and\r\nsevere, and kept me down a good deal, which I felt keenly, but said\r\nnothing. I was not a favourite with my family at that period of my life,\r\nbecause I was reserved and unexpansive, in consequence of the silence I\r\nwas obliged to observe on the subjects which interested me. Three Miss\r\nMelvilles, friends, or perhaps relatives, of Mrs. Charters, were always\r\nheld up to me as models of perfection, to be imitated in everything, and\r\nI wearied of hearing them constantly praised at my expense.\r\n\r\nIn a small society like that of Edinburgh there was a good deal of\r\nscandal and gossip; every one's character and conduct were freely\r\ncriticised, and by none more than by my aunt and her friends. She used\r\nto sit at a window embroidering, where she not only could see every one\r\nthat passed, but with a small telescope could look into the\r\ndressing-room of a lady of her acquaintance, and watch all she did. A\r\nspinster lady of good family, a cousin of ours, carried her gossip so\r\nfar, that she was tried for defamation, and condemned to a month's\r\nimprisonment, which she actually underwent in the Tolbooth. She was let\r\nout just before the king's birthday, to celebrate which, besides the\r\nguns fired at the Castle, the boys let off squibs and crackers in all\r\nthe streets. As the lady in question was walking up the High Street,\r\nsome lads in a wynd, or narrow street, fired a small cannon, and one of\r\nthe slugs with which it was loaded hit her mouth and wounded her tongue.\r\nThis raised a universal laugh; and no one enjoyed it more than my uncle\r\nWilliam, who disliked this somewhat masculine woman.\r\n\r\nWhilst at my uncle's house, I attended a school for writing and\r\narithmetic, and made considerable progress in the latter, for I liked\r\nit, but I soon forgot it from want of practice.\r\n\r\nMy uncle and aunt generally paid a visit to the Lyells of Kinnordy, the\r\nfather and mother of my friend Sir Charles Lyell, the celebrated\r\ngeologist; but this time they accepted an invitation from Captain\r\nWedderburn, and took me with them. Captain Wedderburn was an old\r\nbachelor, who had left the army and devoted himself to agriculture.\r\nMounted on a very tall but quiet horse, I accompanied my host every\r\nmorning when he went over his farm, which was chiefly a grass farm. The\r\nhouse was infested with rats, and a masculine old maid, who was of the\r\nparty, lived in such terror of them, that she had a light in her\r\nbedroom, and after she was in bed, made her maid tuck in the white\r\ndimity curtains all round. One night we were awakened by violent\r\nscreams, and on going to see what was the matter, we found Miss Cowe in\r\nthe middle of the room, bare-footed, in her night-dress, screaming at\r\nthe top of her voice. Instead of tucking the rats out of the bed, the\r\nmaid had tucked one in, and Miss Cowe on waking beheld it sitting on her\r\npillow.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThere was great political agitation at this time. The corruption and\r\ntyranny of the court, nobility, and clergy in France were so great, that\r\nwhen the revolution broke out, a large portion of our population thought\r\nthe French people were perfectly justified in revolting, and warmly\r\nespoused their cause. Later many changed their opinions, shocked, as\r\nevery one was, at the death of the king and queen, and the atrocious\r\nmassacres which took place in France. Yet some not only approved of the\r\nrevolution abroad, but were so disgusted with our mal-administration at\r\nhome, to which they attributed our failure in the war in Holland and\r\nelsewhere, that great dissatisfaction and alarm prevailed throughout the\r\ncountry. The violence, on the other hand, of the opposite party was not\r\nto be described,--the very name of Liberal was detested.\r\n\r\nGreat dissensions were caused by difference of opinion in families; and\r\nI heard people previously much esteemed accused from this cause of all\r\nthat was evil. My uncle William and my father were as violent Tories as\r\nany.\r\n\r\nThe Liberals were distinguished by wearing their hair short, and when\r\none day I happened to say how becoming a crop was, and that I wished the\r\nmen would cut off those ugly pigtails, my father exclaimed, \"By G--,\r\nwhen a man cuts off his queue, the head should go with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe unjust and exaggerated abuse of the Liberal party made me a Liberal.\r\nFrom my earliest years my mind revolted against oppression and tyranny,\r\nand I resented the injustice of the world in denying all those\r\nprivileges of education to my sex which were so lavishly bestowed on\r\nmen. My liberal opinions, both in religion and politics, have remained\r\nunchanged (or, rather, have advanced) throughout my life, but I have\r\nnever been a republican. I have always considered a highly-educated\r\naristocracy essential, not only for government, but for the refinement\r\nof a people.\r\n\r\n    [After her winter in Edinburgh, my mother returned to Burntisland.\r\n    Strange to say, she found there, in an illustrated Magazine of\r\n    Fashions, the introduction to the great study of her life.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI was often invited with my mother to the tea-parties given either by\r\nwidows or maiden ladies who resided at Burntisland. A pool of commerce\r\nused to be keenly contested till a late hour at these parties, which\r\nbored me exceedingly, but I there became acquainted with a Miss Ogilvie,\r\nmuch younger than the rest, who asked me to go and see fancy works she\r\nwas doing, and at which she was very clever. I went next day, and after\r\nadmiring her work, and being told how it was done, she showed me a\r\nmonthly magazine with coloured plates of ladies' dresses, charades, and\r\npuzzles. At the end of a page I read what appeared to me to be simply an\r\narithmetical question; but on turning the page I was surprised to see\r\nstrange looking lines mixed with letters, chiefly X'es and Y's, and\r\nasked; \"What is that?\" \"Oh,\" said Miss Ogilvie, \"it is a kind of\r\narithmetic: they call it Algebra; but I can tell you nothing about it.\"\r\nAnd we talked about other things; but on going home I thought I would\r\nlook if any of our books could tell me what was meant by Algebra.\r\n\r\nIn Robertson's \"Navigation\" I flattered myself that I had got precisely\r\nwhat I wanted; but I soon found that I was mistaken. I perceived,\r\nhowever, that astronomy did not consist in star-gazing,[3] and as I\r\npersevered in studying the book for a time, I certainly got a dim view\r\nof several subjects which were useful to me afterwards. Unfortunately\r\nnot one of our acquaintances or relations knew anything of science or\r\nnatural history; nor, had they done so, should I have had courage to ask\r\nany of them a question, for I should have been laughed at. I was often\r\nvery sad and forlorn; not a hand held out to help me.\r\n\r\nMy uncle and aunt Charters took a house at Burntisland for the summer,\r\nand the Miss Melville I have already mentioned came to pay them a visit.\r\nShe painted miniatures, and from seeing her at work, I took a fancy to\r\nlearn to draw, and actually wasted time in copying prints; but this\r\ncircumstance enabled me to get elementary books on Algebra and Geometry\r\nwithout asking questions of any one, as will be explained afterwards.\r\nThe rest of the summer I spent in playing on the piano and learning\r\nGreek enough to read Xenophon and part of Herodotus; then we prepared to\r\ngo to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nMy mother was so much afraid of the sea that she never would cross the\r\nFirth except in a boat belonging to a certain skipper who had served in\r\nthe Navy and lost a hand; he had a hook fastened on the stump to enable\r\nhim to haul ropes. My brother and I were tired of the country, and one\r\nsunny day we persuaded my mother to embark. When we came to the shore,\r\nthe skipper said, \"I wonder that the leddy boats to-day, for though it\r\nis calm here under the lee of the land, there is a stiff breeze\r\noutside.\" We made him a sign to hold his tongue, for we knew this as\r\nwell as he did. Our mother went down to the cabin and remained silent\r\nand quiet for a time; but when we began to roll and be tossed about, she\r\ncalled out to the skipper, \"George! this is an awful storm, I am sure we\r\nare in great danger. Mind how you steer; remember, I trust in you!\" He\r\nlaughed, and said, \"Dinna trust in me, leddy; trust in God Almighty.\"\r\nOur mother, in perfect terror, called out, \"Dear me! is it come to\r\nthat?\" We burst out laughing, skipper and all.\r\n\r\nNasmyth, an exceedingly good landscape painter, had opened an academy\r\nfor ladies in Edinburgh, a proof of the gradual improvement which was\r\ntaking place in the education of the higher classes; my mother, very\r\nwillingly allowed me to attend it. The class was very full. I was not\r\ntaught to draw, but looked on while Nasmyth painted; then a picture was\r\ngiven me to copy, the master correcting the faults. Though I spoilt\r\ncanvas, I had made some progress by the end of the season.[4] Mr.\r\nNasmyth, besides being a good artist, was clever, well-informed, and had\r\na great deal of conversation. One day I happened to be near him while he\r\nwas talking to the Ladies Douglas about perspective. He said, \"You\r\nshould study Euclid's Elements of Geometry; the foundation not only of\r\nperspective, but of astronomy and all mechanical science.\" Here, in the\r\nmost unexpected manner, I got the information I wanted, for I at once\r\nsaw that it would help me to understand some parts of Robertson's\r\n\"Navigation;\" but as to going to a bookseller and asking for Euclid the\r\nthing was impossible! Besides I did not yet know anything definite about\r\nAlgebra, so no more could be done at that time; but I never lost sight\r\nof an object which had interested me from the first.\r\n\r\nI rose early, and played four or five hours, as usual, on the piano, and\r\nhad lessons from Corri, an Italian, who taught carelessly, and did not\r\ncorrect a habit I had of thumping so as to break the strings; but I\r\nlearned to tune a piano and mend the strings, as there was no tuner at\r\nBurntisland. Afterwards I got over my bad habit and played the music\r\nthen in vogue: pieces by Pleyel, Clementi, Steibelt, Mozart, and\r\nBeethoven, the last being my favourite to this day. I was sometimes\r\naccompanied on the violin by Mr. Thomson, the friend of Burns; more\r\nfrequently by Stabilini; but I was always too shy to play before people,\r\nand invariably played badly when obliged to do so, which vexed me.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against the theatre had been very great in Scotland, and\r\nstill existed among the rigid Calvinists. One day, when I was fourteen\r\nor fifteen, on going into the drawing-room, an old man sitting beside my\r\nmother rose and kissed me, saying, \"I am one of your mother's oldest\r\nfriends.\" It was Home, the author of the tragedy of \"Douglas.\" He was\r\nobliged to resign his living in the kirk for the scandal of having had\r\nhis play acted in the theatre in Edinburgh, and some of his clerical\r\nfriends were publicly rebuked for going to see it. Our family was\r\nperfectly liberal in all these matters. The first time I had ever been\r\nin a theatre I went with my father to see \"Cymbeline.\" I had never\r\nneglected Shakespeare, and when our great tragedians, Mrs. Siddons and\r\nher brother, John Kemble, came for a short time to act in Edinburgh, I\r\ncould think of nothing else. They were both remarkably handsome, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the Scotch prejudice, the theatre was crowded every\r\nnight. It was a misfortune to me that my mother never would go into\r\nsociety during the absence of my father, nor, indeed, at any time,\r\nexcept, perhaps, to a dinner party; but I had no difficulty in finding a\r\nchaperone, as we knew many people. I used to go to the theatre in the\r\nmorning, and ask to see the plan of the house for the evening, that I\r\nmight know which ladies I could accompany to their boxes. Of course I\r\npaid for my place. Our friends were so kind that I saw these great\r\nartists, as well as Charles Kemble, Young, and Bannister, in \"Hamlet,\"\r\n\"Macbeth,\" \"Othello,\" \"Coriolanus,\" \"The Gamester,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIt was greatly to the honour of the British stage that all the principal\r\nactors, men and women, were of excellent moral character, and much\r\nesteemed. Many years afterwards, when Mrs. Siddons was an old woman, I\r\ndrank tea with her, and heard her read Milton and Shakespeare. Her\r\ndaughter told us to applaud, for she had been so much accustomed to it\r\nin the theatre that she could not read with spirit without this\r\nexpression of approbation.\r\n\r\nMy mother was pleased with my music and painting, and, although she did\r\nnot go to the theatre herself, she encouraged me to go. She was quite of\r\nthe old school with regard to the duties of women, and very particular\r\nabout her table; and, although we were obliged to live with rigid\r\neconomy, our food was of the best quality, well dressed, and neatly\r\nserved, for she could tell the cook exactly what was amiss when anything\r\nwas badly cooked. She thought besides that some of the comfort of\r\nmarried life depended upon the table, so I was sent to a pastrycook for\r\na short time every day, to learn the art of cookery. I had for\r\ncompanions Miss Moncreiff, daughter of Sir Henry Moncreiff Wellwood, a\r\nScotch baronet of old family. She was older than I, pretty, pleasing,\r\nand one of the belles of the day. We were amused at the time, and\r\nafterwards made jellies and creams for little supper parties, then in\r\nfashion, though, as far as economy went, we might as well have bought\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Burntisland, I played on the piano as diligently as\r\never, and painted several hours every day. At this time, however, a Mr.\r\nCraw came to live with us as tutor to my youngest brother, Henry. He had\r\nbeen educated for the kirk, was a fair Greek and Latin scholar, but,\r\nunfortunately for me, was no mathematician. He was a simple,\r\ngood-natured kind of man, and I ventured to ask him about algebra and\r\ngeometry, and begged him, the first time he went to Edinburgh, to buy me\r\nsomething elementary on these subjects, so he soon brought me \"Euclid\"\r\nand Bonnycastle's \"Algebra,\" which were the books used in the schools at\r\nthat time. Now I had got what I so long and earnestly desired. I asked\r\nMr. Craw to hear me demonstrate a few problems in the first book of\r\n\"Euclid,\" and then I continued the study alone with courage and\r\nassiduity, knowing I was on the right road. Before I began to read\r\nalgebra I found it necessary to study arithmetic again, having forgotten\r\nmuch of it. I never was expert at addition, for, in summing up a long\r\ncolumn of pounds, shillings, and pence, in the family account book, it\r\nseldom came out twice the same way. In after life I, of course, used\r\nlogarithms for the higher branches of science.\r\n\r\nI had to take part in the household affairs, and to make and mend my\r\nown clothes. I rose early, played on the piano, and painted during the\r\ntime I could spare in the daylight hours, but I sat up very late reading\r\nEuclid. The servants, however, told my mother \"It was no wonder the\r\nstock of candles was soon exhausted, for Miss Mary sat up reading till a\r\nvery late hour;\" whereupon an order was given to take away my candle as\r\nsoon as I was in bed. I had, however, already gone through the first six\r\nbooks of Euclid, and now I was thrown on my memory, which I exercised by\r\nbeginning at the first book, and demonstrating in my mind a certain\r\nnumber of problems every night, till I could nearly go through the\r\nwhole. My father came home for a short time, and, somehow or other,\r\nfinding out what I was about, said to my mother, \"Peg, we must put a\r\nstop to this, or we shall have Mary in a strait jacket one of these\r\ndays. There was X., who went raving mad about the longitude!\"\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn our younger days my brother Sam and I kept various festivals: we\r\nburnt nuts, ducked for apples, and observed many other of the ceremonies\r\nof Halloween, so well described by Burns, and we always sat up to hail\r\nthe new year on New Year's Eve. When in Edinburgh we sometimes disguised\r\nourselves as \"guisarts,\" and went about with a basket full of Christmas\r\ncakes called buns and shortbread, and a flagon of \"het-pint\" or posset,\r\nto wish our friends a \"Happy New Year.\" At Christmas time a set of men,\r\ncalled the Christmas Wakes, walked slowly through the streets during the\r\nmidnight hours, playing our sweet Scotch airs on flageolets. I remember\r\nthe sound from a distance fell gently on my sleeping ear, swelled\r\nsoftly, and died away in distance again, a passing breeze of sweet\r\nsound. It was very pleasing; some thought it too sad.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather was intimate with the Boswells of Balmuto, a bleak place\r\na few miles to the north of Burntisland. Lord Balmuto, a Scotch judge,\r\nwho was then proprietor, had been a dancing companion of my mother's,\r\nand had a son and two daughters, the eldest a nice girl of my age, with\r\nwhom I was intimate, so I gladly accepted an invitation to visit them at\r\nBalmuto. Lord Balmuto was a large coarse-looking man, with black hair\r\nand beetling eyebrows. Though not vulgar, he was passionate, and had a\r\nboisterous manner. My mother and her sisters gave him the nickname of\r\nthe \"black bull of Norr'away,\" in allusion to the northern position of\r\nBalmuto. Mrs. Boswell was gentle and ladylike. The son had a turn for\r\nchemistry, and his father took me to see what they called the\r\nLaboratory. What a laboratory might be I knew not, as I had never heard\r\nthe word before, but somehow I did not like the look of the\r\ncuriously-shaped glass things and other apparatus, so when the son put a\r\nsubstance on the table, and took a hammer, his father saying, \"Now you\r\nwill hear a fine report,\" I ran out of the room, saying, \"I don't like\r\nreports.\" Sure enough there was a very loud report, followed by a\r\nviolent crash, and on going into the room again, we found that the son\r\nhad been knocked down, the father was trembling from head to foot, and\r\nthe apparatus had been smashed to pieces. They had had a narrow escape.\r\nMiss Boswell led a dull life, often passing the winter with her mother\r\nin that solitary place, Balmuto; and when in Edinburgh, she was much\r\nkept down by her father, and associated little with people of her own\r\nage and station. The consequence was that she eloped with her\r\ndrawing-master, to the inexpressible rage and mortification of her\r\nfather, who had all the Scotch pride of family and pure blood.\r\n\r\nThis year we remained longer in the country than usual, and I went to\r\nspend Christmas with the Oswalds of Dunnikeir. The family consisted of a\r\nson, a colonel in the army, and three daughters, the youngest about my\r\nage, a bold horsewoman. She had talent, became a good Greek and Latin\r\nscholar, and was afterwards married to the Earl of Elgin. More than\r\nseventy years after this I had a visit from the Dean of Westminster and\r\nLady Augusta Stanley, her daughter; a very charming person, who told me\r\nabout her family, of which I had heard nothing for years. I was very\r\nhappy to see the Dean, one of the most liberal and distinguished members\r\nof the Church of England, and son of my old friend the late Bishop of\r\nNorwich.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Edinburgh Mr. Nasmyth was much pleased with the\r\nprogress I had made in painting, for, besides having copied several\r\nlandscapes he had lent me, I had taken the outline of a print and\r\ncoloured it from a storm I saw at the end of our garden. This picture I\r\nstill possess.\r\n\r\nDr. Blair, minister of the High Kirk of Edinburgh, the well-known author\r\nand professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres in the University, an\r\nintimate friend of my grandfather's, had heard of my turn for painting,\r\nand asked my mother to let him see some of my pictures. A few of the\r\nbest were sent to him, and were returned after a few days accompanied by\r\na long letter from the old gentleman, pointing out what he admired most\r\nin each picture. I was delighted with the letter, and not a little vain\r\nof the praise.\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM DR. BLAIR TO MARY FAIRFAX.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MISS FAIRFAX,\r\n\r\n    This comes to return you a thousand thanks for the pleasure and\r\n    entertainment I have had from your landscape paintings. I had them\r\n    placed in the best light I could contrive in my drawing-room, and\r\n    entertained myself a good while every day looking at them and\r\n    admiring their beauties, which always grew upon me. I intend to\r\n    return them to you to-morrow, or rather on the beginning of next\r\n    week; and as they were taken particular care of, I hope they shall\r\n    not appear to have suffered any injury.\r\n\r\n    I have exhibited them to several people, some of whom were excellent\r\n    judges, whom I brought on purpose to view them--Lady Miller, the\r\n    Solicitor and Mrs. Blair, his lady, Dr. Hill, Miss Anne Ker of\r\n    Nisbet, and a variety of ladies. All joined in praising them highly.\r\n    The penserosa figure caught the highest admiration of any, from the\r\n    gracefulness of the figure and attitude, and the boldness and\r\n    propriety of the scenery. The two morning and evening views--one of\r\n    Lochness, and the other of Elcho Castle--which make fine companions,\r\n    and which I always placed together, were also highly admired. Each\r\n    of them had their different partizans, and I myself was for a good\r\n    while undetermined which of them to prefer. At last, I found the\r\n    placidity of the scene in Elcho Castle, with the cottages among the\r\n    trees, dwelt most on my imagination, though the gaiety and\r\n    brightness of the morning sky in the other has also exquisite\r\n    beauty. On the whole, I am persuaded that your taste and powers of\r\n    execution in that art are uncommonly great, and that if you go on\r\n    you must excel highly, and may go what length you please. Landscape\r\n    painting has been always a great favourite with me; and you have\r\n    really contributed much to my entertainment. As I thought you might\r\n    wish to know my sentiments, after your paintings had been a little\r\n    considered, I was led to write you these lines (in which I assure\r\n    you there is nothing flattering), before sending back your pieces to\r\n    you. With best compliments to Lady Fairfax, believe me,\r\n\r\n                            Your obliged and most obedient Servant,\r\n                                                            HUGH BLAIR.\r\n    ARGYLL SQUARE, _11th April_ (probably) 1796.\r\n\r\nA day or two after this a Mrs. Ramsay, a rich proud widow, a relation of\r\nmy mother's, came with her daughter, who was an heiress, to pay us a\r\nmorning visit. Looking round the room she asked who had painted the\r\npictures hung up on the walls. My mother, who was rather proud of them,\r\nsaid they were painted by me. \"I am glad,\" said Mrs. Ramsay, \"that Miss\r\nFairfax has any kind of talent that may enable her to win her bread, for\r\neveryone knows she will not have a sixpence.\" It was a very severe hit,\r\nbecause it was true. Had it been my lot to win my bread by painting, I\r\nfear I should have fared badly, but I never should have been ashamed of\r\nit; on the contrary, I should have been very proud had I been\r\nsuccessful. I must say the idea of making money had never entered my\r\nhead in any of my pursuits, but I was intensely ambitious to excel in\r\nsomething, for I felt in my own breast that women were capable of taking\r\na higher place in creation than that assigned to them in my early days,\r\nwhich was very low.\r\n\r\nNot long after Mrs. Ramsay's visit to my mother, Miss Ramsay went to\r\nvisit the Dons, at Newton Don, a pretty place near Kelso. Miss Ramsay\r\nand the three Miss Dons were returning from a long walk; they had\r\nreached the park of Newton Don, when they heard the dinner bell ring,\r\nand fearing to be too late for dinner, instead of going round, they\r\nattempted to cross a brook which runs through the park. One of the Miss\r\nDons stumbled on the stepping-stones and fell into the water. Her two\r\nsisters and Miss Ramsay, trying to save her, fell in one after another.\r\nThe three Miss Dons were drowned, but Miss Ramsay, who wore a stiff\r\nworsted petticoat, was buoyed up by it and carried down stream, where\r\nshe caught by the branch of a tree and was saved. She never recovered\r\nthe shock of the dreadful scene.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Many people evidently think the science of astronomy\r\nconsists entirely in observing the stars, for I have been frequently\r\nasked if I passed my nights looking through a telescope, and I have\r\nastonished the enquirers by saying I did not even possess one.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Nasmyth told a lady still alive who took lessons from him\r\nin her youth, that the cleverest young lady he ever taught was Miss Mary\r\nFairfax.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH SUPPER PARTIES--TOUR IN THE HIGHLANDS--MUTINY IN THE\r\nFLEET--BATTLE OF CAMPERDOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [By this time my mother was grown up, and extremely pretty. All\r\n    those who knew her speak of her rare and delicate beauty, both of\r\n    face and figure. They called her the \"Rose of Jedwood.\" She kept her\r\n    beauty to the last day of her life, and was a beautiful old woman,\r\n    as she had been a lovely young one. She used to say, laughing, that\r\n    \"it was very hard no one ever thought of painting her portrait so\r\n    long as she was young and pretty.\" After she became celebrated,\r\n    various likenesses were taken of her, by far the best of which are a\r\n    beautiful bust, modelled at Rome in 1844 by Mr. Lawrence Macdonald,\r\n    and a crayon drawing by Mr. James Swinton, done in London in 1848.\r\n    My mother always looked considerably younger than her age; even at\r\n    ninety, she looked younger than some who were her juniors by several\r\n    years. This was owing, no doubt, principally to her being small and\r\n    delicate in face and figure, but also, I think, to the extreme\r\n    youthfulness and freshness of both her heart and mind, neither of\r\n    which ever grew old. It certainly was not due to a youthful style of\r\n    dress, for she had perfect taste in such matters, as well as in\r\n    other things; and although no one spent less thought or money on it\r\n    than she, my mother was at all times both neatly and becomingly\r\n    dressed. She never was careless; and her room, her papers, and all\r\n    that belonged to her were invariably in the most beautiful order. My\r\n    mother's recollections of this period of her life are as follows:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt that time Edinburgh was really the capital of Scotland; most of the\r\nScotch families of distinction spent the winter there, and we had\r\nnumerous acquaintances who invited me to whatever gaiety was going on.\r\nAs my mother refused to go into society when my father was at sea, I had\r\nto find a chaperon; but I never was at a loss, for we were somehow\r\nrelated to the Erskine family, and the Countess of Buchan, an amiable\r\nold lady, was always ready to take charge of me.\r\n\r\nIt was under Lady Buchan's care that I made my first appearance at a\r\nball, and my first dancing partner was the late Earl of Minto, then Mr.\r\nGilbert Elliot, with whom I was always on very friendly terms, as well\r\nas with his family. Many other ladies were willing to take charge of me,\r\nbut a chaperon was only required for the theatre, and concerts, and for\r\nballs in the public assembly rooms; at private balls the lady of the\r\nhouse was thought sufficient. Still, although I was sure to know\r\neverybody in the room, or nearly so, I liked to have some one with whom\r\nto enter and to sit beside. Few ladies kept carriages, but went in sedan\r\nchairs, of which there were stands in the principal streets. Ladies were\r\ngenerally attended by a man-servant, but I went alone, as our household\r\nconsisted of two maid-servants only. My mother knew, however, that the\r\nHighlanders who carried me could be trusted. I was fond of dancing, and\r\nnever without partners, and often came home in bright daylight. The\r\ndances were reels, country dances, and sometimes Sir Roger de Coverley.\r\n\r\n    [At this period, although busily engaged in studying painting at\r\n    Nasmyth's academy, practising the piano five hours a day, and\r\n    pursuing her more serious studies zealously, my mother went a good\r\n    deal into society, for Edinburgh was a gay, sociable place, and many\r\n    people who recollect her at that time, and some who were her dancing\r\n    partners, have told me she was much admired, and a great favourite.\r\n    They said she had a graceful figure, below the middle size, a small\r\n    head, well set on her shoulders, a beautiful complexion, bright,\r\n    intelligent eyes, and a profusion of soft brown hair. Besides the\r\n    various occupations I have mentioned, she made all her own dresses,\r\n    even for balls. These, however, unlike the elaborate productions of\r\n    our day, were simply of fine India muslin, with a little Flanders\r\n    lace. She says of her life in Edinburgh:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nGirls had perfect liberty at that time in Edinburgh; we walked together\r\nin Princes Street, the fashionable promenade, and were joined by our\r\ndancing partners. We occasionally gave little supper parties, and\r\npresented these young men to our parents as they came in. At these\r\nmeetings we played at games, danced reels, or had a little music--never\r\ncards. After supper there were toasts, sentiments, and songs. There were\r\nalways one or two hot dishes, and a variety of sweet things and fruit.\r\nThough I was much more at ease in society now, I was always terribly put\r\nout when asked for a toast or a sentiment. Like other girls, I did not\r\ndislike a little quiet flirtation; but I never could speak across a\r\ntable, or take a leading part in conversation. This diffidence was\r\nprobably owing to the secluded life I led in my early youth. At this\r\ntime I gladly took part in any gaiety that was going on, and spent the\r\nday after a ball in idleness and gossiping with my friends; but these\r\nwere rare occasions, for the balls were not numerous, and I never lost\r\nsight of the main object of my life, which was to prosecute my studies.\r\nSo I painted at Nasmyth's, played the usual number of hours on the\r\npiano, worked and conversed with my mother in the evening; and as we\r\nkept early hours, I rose at day-break, and after dressing, I wrapped\r\nmyself in a blanket from my bed on account of the excessive\r\ncold--having no fire at that hour--and read algebra or the classics till\r\nbreakfast time. I had, and still have, determined perseverance, but I\r\nsoon found that it was in vain to occupy my mind beyond a certain time.\r\nI grew tired and did more harm than good; so, if I met with a difficult\r\npoint, for example, in algebra, instead of poring over it till I was\r\nbewildered, I left it, took my work or some amusing book, and resumed it\r\nwhen my mind was fresh. Poetry was my great resource on these occasions,\r\nbut at a later period I read novels, the \"Old English Baron,\" the\r\n\"Mysteries of Udolpho,\" the \"Romance of the Forest,\" &c. I was very fond\r\nof ghost and witch stories, both of which were believed in by most of\r\nthe common people and many of the better educated. I heard an old naval\r\nofficer say that he never opened his eyes after he was in bed. I asked\r\nhim why? and he replied, \"For fear I should see something!\" Now I did\r\nnot actually believe in either ghosts or witches, but yet, when alone in\r\nthe dead of the night, I have been seized with a dread of, I know not\r\nwhat. Few people will now understand me if I say I was _eerie_, a Scotch\r\nexpression for superstitious awe. I have been struck, on reading the\r\nlife of the late Sir David Brewster, with the influence the\r\nsuperstitions of the age and country had on both learned and unlearned.\r\nSir David was one of the greatest philosophers of the day. He was only a\r\nyear younger than I; we were both born in Jedburgh, and both were\r\ninfluenced by the superstitions of our age and country in a similar\r\nmanner, for he confessed that, although he did not believe in ghosts, he\r\nwas _eerie_ when sitting up to a late hour in a lone house that was\r\nhaunted. This is a totally different thing from believing in\r\nspirit-rapping, which I scorn.\r\n\r\nWe returned as usual to Burntisland, in spring, and my father, who was\r\nat home, took my mother and me a tour in the Highlands. I was a great\r\nadmirer of Ossian's poems, and viewed the grand and beautiful scenery\r\nwith awe; and my father, who was of a romantic disposition, smiled at my\r\nenthusiastic admiration of the eagles as they soared above the\r\nmountains. These noble birds are nearly extirpated; and, indeed, the\r\nfeathered tribes, which were more varied and numerous in Britain than in\r\nany part of Europe, will soon disappear. They will certainly be avenged\r\nby the insects.\r\n\r\nOn coming home from the journey I was quite broken-hearted to find my\r\nbeautiful goldfinch, which used to draw its water so prettily with an\r\nivory cup and little chain, dead in its cage. The odious wretches of\r\nservants, to whose care I trusted it, let it die of hunger. My heart is\r\ndeeply pained as I write this, seventy years afterwards.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn Fifeshire, as elsewhere, political opinions separated friends and\r\ndisturbed the peace of families; discussions on political questions were\r\nviolent and dangerous on account of the hard-drinking then so prevalent.\r\nAt this time the oppression and cruelty committed in Great Britain were\r\nalmost beyond endurance. Men and women were executed for what at the\r\npresent day would only have been held to deserve a few weeks' or months'\r\nimprisonment.[5] Every liberal opinion was crushed, men were entrapped\r\ninto the army by promises which were never kept, and press-gangs tore\r\nmerchant seamen from their families, and forced them to serve in the\r\nnavy, where they were miserably provided for. The severity of discipline\r\nin both services amounted to torture. Such was the treatment of the\r\nbrave men on whom the safety of the nation depended! They could bear it\r\nno longer; a mutiny broke out in the fleet which had been cruising off\r\nthe Texel to watch the movements of a powerful Dutch squadron. The men\r\nrose against their officers, took the command, and ship after ship\r\nreturned to England, leaving only a frigate and the \"Venerable,\"\r\ncommanded by Admiral Duncan, with my father as his flag-captain. To\r\ndeceive the Dutch, they continued to make signals, as if the rest of the\r\nfleet were in the offing, till they could return to England; when,\r\nwithout delay, Admiral Duncan and my father went alone on board each\r\nship, ordered the men to arrest the ringleaders, which was done, and the\r\nfleet immediately returned to its station off the Texel. At last, on the\r\nmorning of the 11th October, 1797, the Dutch fleet came out in great\r\nforce, and formed in line of battle; that is, with their broadsides\r\ntowards our ships. Then Admiral Duncan said to my father, \"Fairfax, what\r\nshall we do?\"--\"Break their line, sir, and draw up on the other side,\r\nwhere they will not be so well prepared.\"--\"Do it, then, Fairfax.\" So my\r\nfather signalled accordingly. The circumstances of the battle, which was\r\nnobly fought on both sides, are historical. Nine ships of the line and\r\ntwo frigates were taken, and my father was sent home to announce the\r\nvictory to the Admiralty. The rejoicing was excessive; every town and\r\nvillage was illuminated; and the Administration, relieved from the fear\r\nof a revolution, continued more confidently its oppressive measures.\r\n\r\nWhen Admiral Duncan came to London, he was made a Baron, and afterwards\r\nEarl of Camperdown; and, by an unanimous vote of the House of Commons,\r\nhe received a pension or a sum of money, I forget which; my father was\r\nknighted, and made Colonel of Marines. Earl Spencer was First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty at the time, and Lady Spencer said to my father, \"You ask\r\nfor the promotion of your officers, but you never have asked a reward\r\nfor yourself.\" He replied, \"I leave that to my country.\" But his country\r\ndid nothing for him; and at his death my mother had nothing to live upon\r\nbut the usual pension of an Admiral's widow, of seventy-five pounds\r\na-year. Our friends, especially Robert Ferguson, junior, of Raith, made\r\nvarious attempts to obtain an addition to it; but it was too late:\r\nCamperdown was forgotten.\r\n\r\nI remember one morning going to Lord Camperdown's house in Edinburgh\r\nwith my mother, to see a very large painting, representing the\r\nquarter-deck of the \"Venerable,\" Admiral Duncan, as large as life,\r\nstanding upright, and the Dutch Admiral, De Winter, presenting his sword\r\nto my father. Another representation of the same scene may be seen among\r\nthe numerous pictures of naval battles which decorate the walls of the\r\ngreat hall at Greenwich Hospital. Many years afterwards I was surprised\r\nto see an engraving of this very picture in the public library at\r\nMilan. I did not know that one existed.\r\n\r\nAt a great entertainment given to Lord Duncan by the East India Company,\r\nthen in great power, the President asked my father, who sat at his left\r\nhand, if he had any relation in India? He replied, \"My eldest son is in\r\nthe Company's military service.\" \"Then,\" said the President, \"he shall\r\nbe a Writer, the highest appointment in my power to bestow.\" I cannot\r\ntell how thankful we were; for, instead of a separation of almost a\r\nlifetime, it gave hopes that my brother might make a sufficient fortune\r\nin a few years to enable him to come home. There was a great review of\r\nthe troops at Calcutta, under a burning sun; my brother returned to the\r\nbarracks, sun-struck, where he found his appointment, and died that\r\nevening, at the age of twenty-one.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [My mother has often told us of her heart-broken parting with this\r\n    brother on his going to India. It was then almost for a lifetime,\r\n    and he was her favourite brother, and the companion of her\r\n    childhood. He must have been wonderfully handsome, judging from a\r\n    beautifully-painted miniature which we have of him.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPublic events became more and more exciting every day, and difficulties\r\noccurred at home. There had been bad harvests, and there was a great\r\nscarcity of bread; the people were much distressed, and the\r\nmanufacturing towns in England were almost in a state of revolution; but\r\nthe fear of invasion kept them quiet. I gloried in the brilliant success\r\nof our arms by land and by sea; and although I should have been glad if\r\nthe people had resisted oppression at home, when we were threatened with\r\ninvasion, I would have died to prevent a Frenchman from landing on our\r\ncoast. No one can imagine the intense excitement which pervaded all\r\nranks at that time. Every one was armed, and, notwithstanding the alarm,\r\nwe could not but laugh at the awkward, and often ridiculous, figures of\r\nour old acquaintances, when at drill in uniform. At that time I went to\r\nvisit my relations at Jedburgh. Soon after my arrival, we were awakened\r\nin the middle of the night by the Yeomanry entering the town at full\r\ngallop. The beacons were burning on the top of the Cheviots and other\r\nhills, as a signal that the French had landed. When day came, every\r\npreparation was made; but it was a false alarm.\r\n\r\nThe rapid succession of victories by sea and land was intensely\r\nexciting. We always illuminated our house, and went to the rocky bank in\r\nour southern garden to see the illumination of Edinburgh, Leith, and the\r\nshipping in the Roads, which was inexpressibly beautiful, though there\r\nwas no gas in those times. It often happened that balls were given by\r\nthe officers of the ships of war that came occasionally to Leith Roads,\r\nand I was always invited, but never allowed to go; for my mother thought\r\nit foolish to run the risk of crossing the Firth, a distance of seven\r\nmiles, at a late hour, in a small open boat and returning in the\r\nmorning, as the weather was always uncertain, and the sea often rough\r\nfrom tide and wind. On one occasion, my father was at home, and, though\r\nit was blowing hard, I thought he would not object to accepting the\r\ninvitation; but he said, \"Were it a matter of duty, you should go, even\r\nat the risk of your life, but for a ball, certainly not.\"\r\n\r\nWe were as poor as ever, even more so; for my father was led into\r\nunavoidable expenses in London; so, after all the excitement, we\r\nreturned to our more than usually economical life. No events worth\r\nmentioning happened for a long time. I continued my diversified pursuits\r\nas usual; had they been more concentrated, it would have been better;\r\nbut there was no choice; for I had not the means of pursuing any one as\r\nfar as I could wish, nor had I any friend to whom I could apply for\r\ndirection or information. I was often deeply depressed at spending so\r\nmuch time to so little purpose.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The late Justice Coltman told us, when he and Lady Coltman\r\ncame to see my father and mother at Siena, that he recollected when he\r\nfirst went the circuit seeing more than twenty people hanged at once at\r\nYork, chiefly for horse-stealing and such offences.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFIRST MARRIAGE (1804)--WIDOWHOOD--STUDIES--SECOND MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Mr. Samuel Greig was a distant relation of the Charters family. His\r\n    father, an officer in the British navy, had been sent by our\r\n    government, at the request of the Empress Catharine, to organize the\r\n    Russian navy. Mr. Greig came to the Firth of Forth on board a\r\n    Russian frigate, and was received by the Fairfaxes at Burntisland\r\n    with Scotch hospitality, as a cousin. He eventually married my\r\n    mother; not, however, until he had obtained the Russian consulship,\r\n    and settled permanently in London, for Russia was then governed in\r\n    the most arbitrary and tyrannical manner, and was neither a safe nor\r\n    a desirable residence, and my grandfather only gave his consent to\r\n    the marriage on this condition. My mother says:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMy cousin, Samuel Greig, commissioner of the Russian navy, and Russian\r\nconsul for Britain, came to pay us a visit, and ultimately became my\r\nhusband. Fortune I had none, and my mother could only afford to give me\r\na very moderate trousseau, consisting chiefly of fine personal and\r\nhousehold linen. When I was going away she gave me twenty pounds to buy\r\na shawl or something warm for the following winter. I knew that the\r\nPresident of the Academy of Painting, Sir Arthur Shee, had painted a\r\nportrait of my father immediately after the battle of Camperdown, and I\r\nwent to see it. The likeness pleased me,--the price was twenty pounds;\r\nso instead of a warm shawl I bought my father's picture, which I have\r\nsince given to my nephew, Sir William George Fairfax. My husband's\r\nbrother, Sir Alexis Greig, who commanded the Russian naval force in the\r\nBlack Sea for more than twenty years, came to London about this time,\r\nand gave me some furs, which were very welcome. Long after this, I\r\napplied to Sir Alexis, at the request of Dr. Whewell, Master of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, and through his interest an order was issued by the\r\nRussian Government for simultaneous observations to be made of the tides\r\non every sea-coast of the empire.\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM DR. WHEWELL TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    UNIVERSITY CLUB, _Jan. 5, 1838_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I enclose a memorandum respecting tide observations, to which\r\n    subject I am desirous of drawing the attention of the Russian\r\n    Government. Nobody knows better than you do how much remains to be\r\n    done respecting the tides, and what important results any advance in\r\n    that subject would have. I hope, through your Russian friends, you\r\n    may have the means of bringing this memorandum to the notice of the\r\n    administration of their navy, so as to lead to some steps being\r\n    taken, in the way of directing observations to be made. The Russian\r\n    Government has shown so much zeal in promoting science, that I hope\r\n    it will not be difficult to engage them in a kind of research so\r\n    easy, so useful practically, and so interesting in its theoretical\r\n    bearing.\r\n\r\n                    Believe me, dear Mrs. Somerville,\r\n                                     Very faithfully yours,\r\n                                                     W. WHEWELL.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMy husband had taken me to his bachelor's house in London, which was\r\nexceedingly small and ill ventilated. I had a key of the neighbouring\r\nsquare, where I used to walk. I was alone the whole of the day, so I\r\ncontinued my mathematical and other pursuits, but under great\r\ndisadvantages; for although my husband did not prevent me from studying,\r\nI met with no sympathy whatever from him, as he had a very low opinion\r\nof the capacity of my sex, and had neither knowledge of nor interest in\r\nscience of any kind. I took lessons in French, and learnt to speak it so\r\nas to be understood. I had no carriage, so went to the nearest church;\r\nbut, accustomed to our Scotch Kirk, I never could sympathise with the\r\ncoldness and formality of the service of the Church of England. However,\r\nI thought it my duty to go to church and join where I could in prayer\r\nwith the congregation.\r\n\r\nThere was no Italian Opera in Edinburgh; the first time I went to one\r\nwas in London as chaperone to Countess Catharine Woronzow, afterwards\r\nCountess of Pembroke, who was godmother to my eldest son. I sometimes\r\nspent the evening with her, and occasionally dined at the embassy; but\r\nwent nowhere else till we became acquainted with the family of Mr.\r\nThomson Bonar, a rich Russian merchant, who lived in great luxury at a\r\nbeautiful villa at Chiselhurst, in the neighbourhood of London, which\r\nhas since become the refuge of the ex-Emperor Napoleon the Third and the\r\nEmpress Eugénie. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Bonar,--kind,\r\nexcellent people,--with two sons and a daughter, all grown up. We were\r\ninvited from time to time to spend ten days or a fortnight with them,\r\nwhich I enjoyed exceedingly. I had been at a riding school in Edinburgh,\r\nand rode tolerably, but had little practice, as we could not afford to\r\nkeep horses. On our first visit, Mrs. Bonar asked me if I would ride\r\nwith her, as there was a good lady's horse to spare, but I declined.\r\nNext day I said, \"I should like to ride with you.\" \"Why did you not go\r\nout with me yesterday?\" she asked. \"Because I had heard so much of\r\nEnglish ladies' riding, that I thought you would clear all the hedges\r\nand ditches, and that I should be left behind lying on the ground.\" I\r\nspent many pleasant days with these dear good people; and no words can\r\nexpress the horror I felt when we heard that they had been barbarously\r\nmurdered in their bedroom. The eldest son and daughter had been at a\r\nball somewhere near, and on coming home they found that one of the\r\nmen-servants had dashed out the brains of both their parents with a\r\npoker. The motive remains a mystery to this day, for it was not robbery.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [After three years of married life, my mother returned to her\r\n    father's house in Burntisland, a widow, with two little boys. The\r\n    youngest died in childhood. The eldest was Woronzow Greig,\r\n    barrister-at-law, late Clerk of the Peace for Surrey. He died\r\n    suddenly in 1865, to the unspeakable sorrow of his family, and the\r\n    regret of all who knew him.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI was much out of health after my husband's death, and chiefly occupied\r\nwith my children, especially with the one I was nursing; but as I did\r\nnot go into society, I rose early, and, having plenty of time, I resumed\r\nmy mathematical studies. By this time I had studied plane and spherical\r\ntrigonometry, conic sections, and Fergusson's \"Astronomy.\" I think it\r\nwas immediately after my return to Scotland that I attempted to read\r\nNewton's \"Principia.\" I found it extremely difficult, and certainly did\r\nnot understand it till I returned to it some time after, when I studied\r\nthat wonderful work with great assiduity, and wrote numerous notes and\r\nobservations on it. I obtained a loan of what I believe was called the\r\nJesuit's edition, which helped me. At this period mathematical science\r\nwas at a low ebb in Britain; reverence for Newton had prevented men from\r\nadopting the \"Calculus,\" which had enabled foreign mathematicians to\r\ncarry astronomical and mechanical science to the highest perfection.\r\nProfessors Ivory and de Morgan afterwards adopted the \"Calculus\"; but\r\nseveral years elapsed before Mr. Herschel and Mr. Babbage were\r\njoint-editors with Professor Peacock in publishing an abridged\r\ntranslation of La Croix's \"Treatise on the Differential and Integral\r\nCalculus.\" I became acquainted with Mr. Wallace, who was, if I am not\r\nmistaken, mathematical teacher of the Military College at Marlow, and\r\neditor of a mathematical journal published there. I had solved some of\r\nthe problems contained in it and sent them to him, which led to a\r\ncorrespondence, as Mr. Wallace sent me his own solutions in return. Mine\r\nwere sometimes right and sometimes wrong, and it occasionally happened\r\nthat we solved the same problem by different methods. At last I\r\nsucceeded in solving a prize problem! It was a diophantine problem, and\r\nI was awarded a silver medal cast on purpose with my name, which pleased\r\nme exceedingly.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace was elected Professor of Mathematics in the University of\r\nEdinburgh, and was very kind to me. When I told him that I earnestly\r\ndesired to go through a regular course of mathematical and astronomical\r\nscience, even including the highest branches, he gave me a list of the\r\nrequisite books, which were in French, and consisted of Francoeur's\r\npure \"Mathematics,\" and his \"Elements of Mechanics,\" La Croix's\r\n\"Algebra,\" and his large work on the \"Differential and Integral\r\nCalculus,\" together with his work on \"Finite Differences and Series,\"\r\nBiot's \"Analytical Geometry and Astronomy,\" Poisson's \"Treatise on\r\nMechanics,\" La Grange's \"Theory of Analytical Functions,\" Euler's\r\n\"Algebra,\" Euler's \"Isoperimetrical Problems\" (in Latin), Clairault's\r\n\"Figure of the Earth,\" Monge's \"Application of Analysis to Geometry,\"\r\nCallet's \"Logarithms,\" La Place's \"Mécanique Céleste,\" and his\r\n\"Analytical Theory of Probabilities,\" &c., &c., &c.[6]\r\n\r\nI was thirty-three years of age when I bought this excellent little\r\nlibrary. I could hardly believe that I possessed such a treasure when I\r\nlooked back on the day that I first saw the mysterious word \"Algebra,\"\r\nand the long course of years in which I had persevered almost without\r\nhope. It taught me never to despair. I had now the means, and pursued my\r\nstudies with increased assiduity; concealment was no longer possible,\r\nnor was it attempted. I was considered eccentric and foolish, and my\r\nconduct was highly disapproved of by many, especially by some members of\r\nmy own family, as will be seen hereafter. They expected me to entertain\r\nand keep a gay house for them, and in that they were disappointed. As I\r\nwas quite independent, I did not care for their criticism. A great part\r\nof the day I was occupied with my children; in the evening I worked,\r\nplayed piquet with my father, or played on the piano, sometimes with\r\nviolin accompaniment.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThis was the most brilliant period of the _Edinburgh Review_; it was\r\nplanned and conducted with consummate talent by a small society of men\r\nof the most liberal principles. Their powerful articles gave a severe\r\nand lasting blow to the oppressive and illiberal spirit which had\r\nhitherto prevailed. I became acquainted with some of these illustrious\r\nmen, and with many of their immediate successors. I then met Henry\r\nBrougham, who had so remarkable an influence on my future life. His\r\nsister had been my early companion, and while visiting her I saw her\r\nmother--a fine, intelligent old lady, a niece of Robertson the\r\nhistorian. I had seen the Rev. Sydney Smith, that celebrated wit and\r\nable contributor to the _Review_, at Burntisland, where he and his wife\r\ncame for sea-bathing. Long afterwards we lived on the most friendly\r\nterms till their deaths. Of that older group no one was more celebrated\r\nthan Professor Playfair. He knew that I was reading the \"Mécanique\r\nCéleste,\" and asked me how I got on? I told him that I was stopped short\r\nby a difficulty now and then, but I persevered till I got over it. He\r\nsaid, \"You would do better to read on for a few pages and return to it\r\nagain, it will then no longer seem so difficult.\" I invariably followed\r\nhis advice and with much success.\r\n\r\nProfessor Playfair was a man of the most varied accomplishments and of\r\nthe highest scientific distinction. He was an elderly man when I first\r\nbecame acquainted with him, by no means good-looking, but with a\r\nbenevolent expression, somewhat concealed by the large spectacles he\r\nalways wore. His manner was gravely cheerful; he was perfectly amiable,\r\nand was both respected and loved, but he could be a severe though just\r\ncritic. He liked female society, and, philosopher as he was, marked\r\nattention from the sex obviously flattered him.\r\n\r\nI had now read a good deal on the higher branches of mathematics and\r\nphysical astronomy, but as I never had been taught, I was afraid that I\r\nmight imagine that I understood the subjects when I really did not; so\r\nby Professor Wallace's advice I engaged his brother to read with me, and\r\nthe book I chose to study with him was the \"Mécanique Céleste.\" Mr. John\r\nWallace was a good mathematician, but I soon found that I understood the\r\nsubject as well as he did. I was glad, however, to have taken this\r\nresolution, as it gave me confidence in myself and consequently courage\r\nto persevere. We had advanced but little in this work when my marriage\r\nwith my cousin, William Somerville (1812), put an end to scientific\r\npursuits for a time.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: These books and all the other mathematical works belonging\r\nto my mother at the time of her death have been presented to the College\r\nfor Women, at Girton, Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSOMERVILLE FAMILY--DR. SOMERVILLE'S CHARACTER--LETTERS--JOURNEY TO THE\r\nLAKES--DEATH OF SIR WILLIAM FAIRFAX--REMINISCENCES OF SIR WALTER SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [With regard to my father's family, I cannot do better than quote\r\n    what my grandfather, the Rev. Thomas Somerville, says in his \"Life\r\n    and Times\":--\"I am a descendant of the ancient family of Somerville\r\n    of Cambusnethan, which was a branch of the Somervilles of Drum,\r\n    ennobled in the year 1424. Upon the death of George Somerville, of\r\n    Corhouse, fifty years ago, I became the only male representative of\r\n    the family.\" There is a quaint old chronicle, entitled \"Memorie of\r\n    the Somervilles,\" written by James, eleventh Lord Somerville, who\r\n    died in 1690, which was printed for private distribution, and edited\r\n    by Sir Walter Scott, and gives ample details of all the branches of\r\n    our family. Although infinitely too prolix for our nineteenth\r\n    century ideas, it contains many curious anecdotes and pictures of\r\n    Scottish life.\r\n\r\n    My father was the eldest son of the minister of Jedburgh, and until\r\n    his marriage with my mother, had lived almost entirely abroad and in\r\n    our colonies. It was always a subject of regret to my mother that my\r\n    father never could be induced to publish an account of his important\r\n    travels in South Africa, for which he had ample materials in the\r\n    notes he brought home, many of which we still possess. Without being\r\n    very deeply learned on any one special subject, he was generally\r\n    well-informed, and very intelligent. He was an excellent classical\r\n    scholar, and could repeat long passages from Horace and other\r\n    authors. He had a lively interest in all branches of natural\r\n    history, was a good botanist and mineralogist, and could take note\r\n    of all the strange animals, plants, or minerals he saw in his\r\n    adventurous journies in the countries, now colonized, but then the\r\n    hunting-grounds of Caffres and other uncivilized tribes. He was the\r\n    first white man who penetrated so far into the country, and it was\r\n    not without great risk. Indeed, on one occasion he was sentenced to\r\n    death by a Caffre chief, and only saved by the interposition of the\r\n    chief's mother.\r\n\r\n    My father's style in writing English was singularly pure and\r\n    correct, and he was very fastidious on this topic--a severe critic,\r\n    whether in correcting the children's lessons or in reading over the\r\n    last proof sheets of my mother's works previous to their\r\n    publication. These qualities would have fitted him very well to\r\n    write the history of his travels, but he disliked the trouble of it,\r\n    and, never having the slightest ambition on his own account, he let\r\n    the time for publication slip by. Others travelled over the country\r\n    he first explored, and the novelty was at an end. He was far happier\r\n    in helping my mother in various ways, searching the libraries for\r\n    the books she required, indefatigably copying and recopying her\r\n    manuscripts, to save her time. No trouble seemed too great which he\r\n    bestowed upon her; it was a labour of love. My father was most\r\n    kindhearted, and I have often heard my mother say how many persons\r\n    he had assisted in life, and what generous actions he had done,\r\n    many of them requited with ingratitude, and with betrayal of\r\n    confidence. From the way my mother speaks of their life, it can be\r\n    seen how happy was their marriage and how much sympathy there was\r\n    between them. Speaking of his son's marriage with my mother, the\r\n    Rev. Dr. Somerville says, in his \"Life and Times,\" page 390: \"To\r\n    myself this connection was on every account peculiarly gratifying.\r\n    Miss Fairfax had been born and nursed in my house; her father being\r\n    at that time abroad on public service. She afterwards often resided\r\n    in my family, was occasionally my scholar, and was looked upon by me\r\n    and my wife as if she had been one of our own children. I can truly\r\n    say, that next to them she was the object of our most tender regard.\r\n    Her ardent thirst for knowledge, her assiduous application to study,\r\n    and her eminent proficiency in science and the fine arts, have\r\n    procured her a celebrity rarely obtained by any of her sex. But she\r\n    never displays any pretensions to superiority, while the affability\r\n    of her temper, and the gentleness of her manners afford constant\r\n    sources of gratification to her friends. But what, above all other\r\n    circumstances, rendered my son's choice acceptable to me, was that\r\n    it had been the anxious, though secret, desire of my dear wife.\" I\r\n    have already said that this esteem and affection of her\r\n    father-in-law was warmly responded to by my mother. The following\r\n    letter from her to him shows it vividly:--]\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO THE REV. DR. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    EDINBURGH, _1st June, 1812_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n    I have this moment been gratified and delighted with your excellent\r\n    and affectionate letter; the intercourse we have so long enjoyed has\r\n    always been a source of the purest pleasure to me, and the kind\r\n    interest you have taken from my infancy in my welfare was at all\r\n    times highly flattering, and much valued; but now that the sacred\r\n    name of Father is added, nothing is wanting to complete my\r\n    happiness; and you may rest assured that William is not more anxious\r\n    to hasten our visit to Jedburgh than I am.... With the affectionate\r\n    love of all here,\r\n\r\n             I remain your ever most affectionate daughter,\r\n                                                  MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--I am much flattered by the Latin quotation, and feel happy\r\n    that your instructions have enabled me to read it.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [I will now proceed with the extracts from my mother's\r\n    Recollections:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMy husband had been present at the taking of the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nwas sent by the authorities to make a treaty with the savage tribes on\r\nthe borders of the colony, who had attacked the boors, or Dutch farmers,\r\nand carried off their cattle. In this journey he was furnished with a\r\nwaggon and accompanied by Mr. Daniel, a good artist, who made drawings\r\nof the scenery, as well as of the animals and people. The savage tribes\r\nagain became troublesome, and in a second expedition my cousin was only\r\naccompanied by a faithful Hottentot as interpreter. They were both\r\nmounted, and each led a spare horse with such things as were absolutely\r\nnecessary, and when they bivouacked where, for fear of the natives, they\r\ndid not dare light a fire to keep off the wild beasts, one kept watch\r\nwhile the other slept. After many adventures and dangers, my husband\r\nreached the Orange River, and was the first white man who had ever been\r\nin that part of Africa. He afterwards served in Canada and in Sicily at\r\nthe head of the medical staff, under his friend General Sir James Craig.\r\nOn returning to England he generally lived in London, so that he was\r\nseldom with his family, with whom he was not a favourite on account of\r\nhis liberal principles, the very circumstance that was an attraction to\r\nme. He had lived in the world, was extremely handsome, had gentlemanly\r\nmanners, spoke good English, and was emancipated from Scotch prejudices.\r\n\r\nI had been living very quietly with my parents and children, so until I\r\nwas engaged to my cousin I was not aware of the extreme severity with\r\nwhich my conduct was criticised by his family, and I have no doubt by\r\nmany others; for as soon as our engagement was known I received a most\r\nimpertinent letter from one of his sisters, who was unmarried, and\r\nyounger than I, saying, she \"hoped I would give up my foolish manner of\r\nlife and studies, and make a respectable and useful wife to her\r\nbrother.\" I was extremely indignant. My husband was still more so, and\r\nwrote a severe and angry letter to her; none of the family dared to\r\ninterfere again. I lived in peace with her, but there was a coldness and\r\nreserve between us ever after. I forgot to mention that during my\r\nwidowhood I had several offers of marriage. One of the persons whilst he\r\nwas paying court to me, sent me a volume of sermons with the page\r\nostentatiously turned down at a sermon on the Duties of a Wife, which\r\nwere expatiated upon in the most illiberal and narrow-minded language. I\r\nthought this as impertinent as it was premature; sent back the book and\r\nrefused the proposal.\r\n\r\nMy uncle, the Rev. Dr. Somerville, was delighted with my marriage with\r\nhis son, for he was liberal, and sincerely attached to me. We were\r\nmarried by his intimate friend, Sir Henry Moncreiff Wellwood, and set\r\noff for the lakes in Cumberland. My husband's second sister, Janet,\r\nresolved to go with us, and she succeeded through the influence of my\r\naunt, now my mother-in-law--a very agreeable, but bold, determined\r\nperson, who was always very kind and sincerely attached to me. We were\r\nsoon followed by my cousin, Samuel Somerville and his wife. We had only\r\nbeen a day or two in the little inn at Lowood when he was taken ill of a\r\nfever, which detained us there for more than a month. During his illness\r\nhe took a longing for currant jelly, and here my cookery was needed; I\r\nmade some that was excellent, and I never can forget the astonishment\r\nexpressed at my being able to be so useful.\r\n\r\nSomerville and I proceeded to London; and we managed to obtain a good\r\nposition near Temple Bar to see the Emperor of Russia, the King of\r\nPrussia and his sons, Blucher, Platoff, the Hetman of the Cossacks, &c.,\r\n&c., enter the City. There was a brilliant illumination in the evening,\r\nand great excitement. We often saw these noted persons afterwards, but\r\nwe did not stay long in London, as my husband was appointed head of the\r\nArmy Medical Department in Scotland, so we settled in Edinburgh. As he\r\nwas allowed to have a secretary, he made choice of Donald Finlayson, a\r\nyoung man of great learning and merit, who was to act as tutor to my\r\nson, Woronzow Greig, then attending the High School, of which Mr.\r\nPillans was master. Mr. Finlayson was a remarkably good Greek scholar,\r\nand my husband said, \"Why not take advantage of such an opportunity of\r\nimprovement?\" So I read Homer for an hour every morning before\r\nbreakfast. Mr. Finlayson joined the army as surgeon, and distinguished\r\nhimself by his courage and humanity during the battle of Waterloo; but\r\nhe was lost in the march of the army to Paris, and his brother George,\r\nafter having sought for him in vain, came to live with us in his stead.\r\nHe excelled in botany, and here again, by my husband's advice, I devoted\r\na morning hour to that science, though I was nursing a baby at the time.\r\nI knew the vulgar name of most of the plants that Mr. Finlayson had\r\ngathered, but now I was taught systematically, and afterwards made a\r\nherbarium, both of land plants and fuci. This young man's hopeful career\r\nwas early arrested by his love of science, for he died of jungle fever\r\nin Bengal, caught while in search of plants.\r\n\r\nProfessor Playfair was now old, and resigned his chair, which Mr. Leslie\r\nwas perfectly competent to fill on account of his acknowledged\r\nscientific acquirements; but, being suspected of heretical opinions, his\r\nappointment was keenly opposed, especially on the part of the clergy,\r\nand a violent contest arose, which ended in his favour. We became\r\nacquainted with him and liked him. He was a man of original genius,\r\nfull of information on a variety of subjects, agreeable in conversation\r\nand good natured, but with a singular vanity as to personal appearance.\r\nThough one of the coarsest looking men I ever knew, he talked so much of\r\npolish and refinement that it tempted Mr. William Clerk, of Eldin, to\r\nmake a very clever clay model of his ungainly figure. The professor's\r\nhair was grey, and he dyed it with something that made it purple; and,\r\nas at that time the art was not brought to its present perfection, the\r\noperation was tedious and only employed at intervals, so that the\r\nprofessor's hair was often white at the roots and dark purple at the\r\nextremities. He was always falling in love, and, to Somerville's\r\ninexpressible amusement, he made me his decoy duck, inviting me to see\r\nsome experiments, which he performed dexterously; at the same time\r\ntelling me to bring as many young ladies as I chose, especially\r\nMiss----, for he was sure she had a turn for science. He was unfortunate\r\nin his aspirations, and remained a bachelor to the end of his life.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in Edinburgh, especially among the clergy, to dine\r\nbetween the morning and evening service on Sundays, and to sup at nine\r\nor ten o'clock. In no family were these suppers more agreeable or\r\ncheerful than in that of Sir Henry Moncreiff Wellwood, minister of the\r\nWest Kirk. There were always a few of the friends of Sir Henry and Lady\r\nMoncreiff present, and we were invited occasionally. There was a\r\nsubstantial hot supper of roasted fowls, game, or lamb, and afterwards a\r\nlively, animated conversation on a variety of subjects, without a shade\r\nof austerity, though Sir Henry was esteemed an orthodox preacher.\r\n\r\nThere was an idiot in Edinburgh, the son of a respectable family, who\r\nhad a remarkable memory. He never failed to go to the Kirk on Sunday,\r\nand on returning home could repeat the sermon word for word, saying,\r\nHere the minister coughed, Here he stopped to blow his nose. During the\r\ntour we made in the Highlands we met with another idiot who knew the\r\nBible so perfectly that if you asked him where such a verse was to be\r\nfound, he could tell without hesitation, and repeat the chapter. The\r\ncommon people in Scotland at that time had a kind of serious compassion\r\nfor these harmless idiots, because \"the hand of God was upon them.\"\r\n\r\nThe wise as well as the foolish are sometimes endowed with a powerful\r\nmemory. Dr. Gregory, an eminent Edinburgh physician, one of the\r\ncleverest and most agreeable men I ever met with, was a remarkable\r\ninstance of this. He wrote and spoke Latin fluently, and Somerville,\r\nwho was a good Latinist, met with a Latin quotation in some book he was\r\nreading, but not knowing from whence it was taken, asked his friend Dr.\r\nGregory. \"It is forty years since I read that author,\" said Dr. Gregory,\r\n\"but I think you will find the passage in the middle of such a page.\"\r\nSomerville went for the book, and at the place mentioned there it was.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI had the grief to lose my dear father at this time. He had served\r\nsixty-seven years in the British Navy, and must have been twice on the\r\nNorth American station, for he was present at the taking of Quebec by\r\nGeneral Wolfe, in 1759, and afterwards during the War of Independence.\r\nAfter the battle of Camperdown he was made a Colonel of Marines, and\r\ndied, in 1813, Vice-Admiral of the Red.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nGeology, which has now been so far advanced as a science, was still in\r\nits infancy. Professor Playfair and Mr. Hutton had written on the\r\nsubject; and in my gay young days, when Lady Helen Hall was occasionally\r\nmy chaperone, I had heard that Sir James Hall had taken up the subject,\r\nbut I did not care about it; I am certain that at that time I had never\r\nheard the word Geology. I think it was now, on going with Somerville to\r\nsee the Edinburgh Museum, that I recognised the fossil plants I had seen\r\nin the coal limestone on the sands at the Links of Burntisland.\r\nUltimately Geology became a favourite pursuit of ours, but then minerals\r\nwere the objects of our joint study. Mineralogy had been much cultivated\r\non the Continent by this time, especially in Germany. It had been\r\nestablished as a science by Werner, who was educated at an institution\r\nnear the silver mines of Friburg, where he afterwards lectured on the\r\nproperties of crystals, and had many pupils. In one of our tours on the\r\nContinent, Somerville and I went to see these silver mines and bought\r\nsome specimens for our cabinet. The French took up the subject with\r\ngreat zeal, and the Abbé Haüy's work became a standard book on the\r\nscience. Cabinets of minerals had been established in the principal\r\ncities of Great Britain, professors were appointed in the Universities,\r\nand collections of minerals were not uncommon in private houses. While\r\nquite a girl, I went with my parents to visit the Fergusons of Raith,\r\nnear Kirkcaldy, and there I saw a magnificent collection of minerals,\r\nmade by their son while abroad. It contained gems of great value and\r\ncrystallized specimens of precious and other metals, which surprised and\r\ninterested me; but seeing that such valuable things could never be\r\nobtained by me, I thought no more about them. In those early days I had\r\nevery difficulty to contend with; now, through the kindness and liberal\r\nopinions of my husband, I had every encouragement. He took up the study\r\nof mineralogy with zeal, and I heartily joined with him. We made the\r\nacquaintance of Professor Jameson, a pupil of Werner's, whose work on\r\nmineralogy was of great use to us. We began to form a cabinet of\r\nminerals, which, although small, were good of their kind. We were\r\ncriticized for extravagance, and, no doubt I had the lion's share of\r\nblame; but more of minerals hereafter.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAbbotsford is only twelve miles distant from Jedburgh, and my\r\nfather-in-law, Dr. Somerville, and Sir Walter Scott had been intimate\r\nfriends for many years, indeed through life. The house at Abbotsford was\r\nat first a mere cottage, on the banks of the Tweed; my brother-in-law,\r\nSamuel, had a villa adjacent to it, and John, Lord Somerville, had a\r\nhouse and property on the opposite bank of the river, to which he came\r\nevery spring for salmon fishing. He was a handsome, agreeable man, had\r\nbeen educated in England, and as he thought he should never live in\r\nScotland, he sold the family estate of Drum, within five miles of\r\nEdinburgh, which he afterwards regretted, and bought the property on the\r\nTweed he then inhabited.\r\n\r\nThere was great intimacy between the three families, and the society was\r\noften enlivened by Adam Ferguson and Willie Clerk, whom we had met with\r\nat Raith. I shall never forget the charm of this little society,\r\nespecially the supper-parties at Abbotsford, when Scott was in the\r\nhighest glee, telling amusing tales, ancient legends, ghost and witch\r\nstories. Then Adam Ferguson would sing the \"Laird of Cockpen,\" and other\r\ncomic songs, and Willie Clerk amused us with his dry wit. When it was\r\ntime to go away all rose, and, standing hand-in-hand round the table,\r\nScott taking the lead, we sang in full chorus,\r\n\r\n    Weel may we a' be,\r\n    Ill may we never see;\r\n    Health to the king\r\n    And the gude companie.\r\n\r\nAt that time no one knew who was the author of the Waverley Novels.\r\nThere was much speculation and curiosity on the subject. While talking\r\nabout one which had just been published, my son Woronzow said, \"I knew\r\nall these stories long ago, for Mr. Scott writes on the dinner-table.\r\nWhen he has finished, he puts the green-cloth with the papers in a\r\ncorner of the dining-room; and when he goes out, Charlie Scott and I\r\nread the stories.\" My son's tutor was the original of Dominie Sampson in\r\n\"Guy Mannering.\" The \"Memorie of the Somervilles\" was edited by Walter\r\nScott, from an ancient and very quaint manuscript found in the archives\r\nof the family, and from this he takes passages which he could not have\r\nfound elsewhere. Although the work was printed it was never published,\r\nbut copies were distributed to the different members of the family. One\r\nwas of course given to my husband.\r\n\r\nThe Burning of the Water, so well described by Walter Scott in\r\n\"Redgauntlet,\" we often witnessed. The illumination of the banks of the\r\nriver, the activity of the men striking the salmon with the \"leisters,\"\r\nand the shouting of the people when a fish was struck, was an animated,\r\nand picturesque, but cruel scene.\r\n\r\nSophia Scott, afterwards married to Mr. Lockhart, editor of the\r\n\"Quarterly Review,\" was the only one of Sir Walter's family who had\r\ntalent. She was not pretty, but remarkably engaging and agreeable, and\r\npossessed her father's joyous disposition as well as his memory and\r\nfondness for ancient Border legends and poetry. Like him, she was\r\nthoroughly alive to peculiarities of character, and laughed at them\r\ngood-naturedly. She was not a musician, had little voice, but she sang\r\nScotch songs and translations from the Gaelic with, or without, harp\r\naccompaniment; the serious songs with so much expression, and the merry\r\nones with so much spirit, that she charmed everybody. The death of her\r\nbrothers and of her father, to whom she was devotedly attached, cast a\r\nshade over the latter part of her life. Mr. Lockhart was clever and an\r\nable writer, but he was too sarcastic to be quite agreeable; however, we\r\nwere always on the most friendly terms. He was of a Lanarkshire family\r\nand distantly related to Somerville. After the death of his wife and\r\nsons, Lockhart fell into bad health and lost much of his asperity.\r\n\r\nScott was ordered to go abroad for health and relaxation. Somerville and\r\nI happened to be at the seaport where he embarked, and we went to take\r\nleave of him. He kissed me, and said, \"Farewell, my dear; I am going to\r\ndie abroad like other British novelists.\" Happy would it have been if\r\nGod had so willed it,[7] for he returned completely broken down, and his\r\nhopes blighted. In a few years his only remaining descendant was a\r\ngrand-daughter, the only surviving child of Mrs. Lockhart, Charlotte who\r\nmarried Mr. James Hope, and soon died, leaving an only daughter, now\r\nthe last descendant of Sir Walter Scott. Thus the \"Merry, merry days\r\nthat I have seen,\" ended very sadly.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhen at Jedburgh, I never failed to visit James Veitch, who was Laird of\r\nInchbonny, a small property beautifully situated in the valley of the\r\nJed, at a short distance from the manse. He was a plough-wright, a\r\nhard-working man, but of rare genius, who taught himself mathematics and\r\nastronomy in the evenings with wonderful success, for he knew the\r\nmotions of the planets, calculated eclipses and occultations, was versed\r\nin various scientific subjects, and made excellent telescopes, of which\r\nI bought a very small one; it was the only one I ever possessed. Veitch\r\nwas handsome, with a singularly fine bald forehead and piercing eyes,\r\nthat quite looked through one. He was perfectly aware of his talents,\r\nshrewd, and sarcastic. His fame had spread, and he had many visits, of\r\nwhich he was impatient, as it wasted his time. He complained especially\r\nof those from ladies not much skilled in science, saying, \"What should\r\nthey do but ask silly questions, when they spend their lives in doing\r\nnaething but spatting muslin?\" Veitch was strictly religious and\r\nconscientious, observing the Sabbath day with great solemnity; and I\r\nhad the impression that he was stern to his wife, who seemed to be a\r\nperson of intelligence, for I remember seeing her come from the\r\nwashing-tub to point out the planet Venus while it was still daylight.\r\n\r\nThe return of Halley's comet, in 1835, exactly at the computed time, was\r\na great astronomical event, as it was the first comet of long period\r\nclearly proved to belong to our system. I was asked by Mr. John Murray\r\nto write an article on the subject for the \"Quarterly Review.\" After it\r\nwas published, I received a letter from James Veitch, reproaching me for\r\nhaving mentioned that a peasant in Hungary was the first to see Halley's\r\ncomet, and for having omitted to say that, \"a peasant at Inchbonny was\r\nthe first to see the comet of 1811, the greatest that had appeared for a\r\ncentury.\" I regretted, on receiving this letter, that I either had not\r\nknown, or had forgotten the circumstance. Veitch has been long dead, but\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity of making the _amende honorable_ to a\r\nman of great mental power and acquirements who had struggled through\r\ndifficulties, unaided, as I have done myself.\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM JAMES VEITCH TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    INCHBONNY, _12th October, 1836_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n    I saw in the Quarterly review for December 1885 page 216 that the\r\n    comet 1682 was discovered by a Peasent, George Palitzch residing in\r\n    the neighbourhood of Dresden on the 25th of December 1758 with a\r\n    small Telescope. But no mention is made of the Peasent at Inchbonny\r\n    who first discovered the beautiful comet 1811. You will remember\r\n    when Dr. Wollaston was at Inchbonny I put a difficult question to\r\n    him that I could not solve about the focal distance of optic glasses\r\n    when the Dr. got into a passion and said: Had he problems in his\r\n    pocket ready to pull out in every occasion? and with an angry look\r\n    at me said, You pretend to be the first that discovered the comet\r\n    altho' it has been looked for by men of science for some time back.\r\n    Now I never heard of such a thing and you will perhaps know\r\n    something about it as the Dr. would not be mistaken. After we got\r\n    acquainted, the Dr. was a warm friend of mine and I have often\r\n    regretted that I had not improved the opportunity I had when he was\r\n    here on many things he was master off. What ever others had known or\r\n    expected I knew nothing about, But I know this, that on the 27th of\r\n    August 1811 I first saw it in the NNW. part of the Heavens nigh the\r\n    star marked 26 on the shoulder of the little Lion and continued\r\n    tracing its path among the fixed stars untill it disappeared and it\r\n    was generally admitted that I had discovered it four days before any\r\n    other person in Britain. However Mr. Thomas Dick on the Diffusion of\r\n    Knowledge page 101 and 102 has made the following observation 'The\r\n    splendid comet which appeared in our hemisphere in 1811 was first\r\n    discovered in this country by a sawer. The name of this Gentleman is\r\n    Mr. Veitch and I believe he resides in the neighbourhood of Kelso\r\n    who with a Reflecting telescope of his own construction and from his\r\n    sawpit as an observatory, descried that celestial visitant before it\r\n    had been noticed by any other astronomer in North Britain.' A\r\n    strange story--a sawer and a gentleman; and what is stranger still\r\n    Mr. Baily would not have any place but the sawpit for his\r\n    observatory on the 15th May last. I am sorry to say with all the\r\n    improvement and learning that we can boast of in the present day\r\n    Halley's comet the predictions have not been fulfilled, either with\r\n    respect to time or place. Thus on the 10 October, at 50 minutes past\r\n    5 in the evening the Right ascension of the comet was 163° 37', with\r\n    63° 38' of north declination but by the nautical almanac for the 10\r\n    October its right ascension ought to have been 225° 2' 6, and its\r\n    declination 29° 33'. Hence the difference is no less than 61° in\r\n    Right ascension and 34° in declination. When you have time, write\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n                           Dear Madam, I remain,\r\n                                       Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                 JAMES VEITCH.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster was many years younger than James Veitch; in his\r\nearly years he assisted his father in teaching the parish-school at\r\nJedburgh, and in the evenings he went to Inchbonny to study astronomy\r\nwith James Veitch, who always called him Davie. They were as much\r\npuzzled about the meaning of the word parallax as I had been with regard\r\nto the word algebra, and only learnt what it meant when Brewster went to\r\nstudy for the kirk in Edinburgh. They were both very devout;\r\nnevertheless, Brewster soon gave up the kirk for science, and he devoted\r\nhimself especially to optics, in which he made so many discoveries. Sir\r\nDavid was of ordinary height, with fair or sandy-coloured hair and blue\r\neyes. He was by no means good-looking, yet with a very pleasant, amiable\r\nexpression; in conversation he was cheerful and agreeable when quite at\r\nease, but of a timid, nervous, and irritable temperament, often at war\r\nwith his fellow-philosophers upon disputed subjects, and extremely\r\njealous upon priority of discovery. I was much indebted to Sir David,\r\nfor he reviewed my book on the \"Connexion of the Physical Sciences,\" in\r\nthe April number of the \"Edinburgh Review\" for 1834, and the \"Physical\r\nGeography\" in the April number of the \"North British Review,\" both\r\nfavourably.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Sir Walter died Sept. 21, 1832, in the presence of his two\r\nsons and two daughters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN HANOVER SQUARE--VISIT TO FRANCE--ARAGO--CUVIER--ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [My father was appointed, in 1816, a member of the Army Medical\r\n    Board, and it became necessary for him to reside in London. He and\r\n    my mother accordingly wished farewell to Scotland, and proceeded to\r\n    take up their residence in Hanover Square. My mother preserved the\r\n    following recollections of this journey:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn our way we stopped a day at Birmingham, on purpose to see Watt and\r\nBoulton's manufactory of steam engines at Soho. Mr. Boulton showed us\r\neverything. The engines, some in action, although beautifully smooth,\r\nshowed a power that was almost fearful. Since these early forms of the\r\nsteam engine I have lived to see this all but omnipotent instrument\r\nchange the locomotion of the whole civilized world by sea and by land.\r\n\r\nSoon after our arrival in London we became acquainted with the\r\nillustrious family of the Herschels, through the kindness of our friend\r\nProfessor Wallace, for it was by his arrangement that we spent a day\r\nwith Sir William and Lady Herschel, at Slough. Nothing could exceed the\r\nkindness of Sir William. He made us examine his celebrated telescopes,\r\nand explained their mechanism; and he showed us the manuscripts which\r\nrecorded the numerous astronomical discoveries he had made. They were\r\nall arranged in the most perfect order, as was also his musical library,\r\nfor that great genius was an excellent musician. Unfortunately, his\r\nsister, Miss Caroline Herschel, who shared in the talents of the family,\r\nwas abroad, but his son, afterwards Sir John, my dear friend for many\r\nyears, was at home, quite a youth. It would be difficult to name a\r\nbranch of the physical sciences which he has not enriched by important\r\ndiscoveries. He has ever been a dear and valued friend to me, whose\r\nadvice and criticism I gratefully acknowledge.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI took lessons twice a week from Mr. Glover, who painted landscapes very\r\nprettily, and I liked him on account of his kindness to animals,\r\nespecially birds, which he tamed so that they flew before him when he\r\nwalked, or else sat on the trees, and returned to him when he whistled.\r\nI regret now that I ever resumed my habit of painting in oil;\r\nwater-colours are much better suited to an amateur, but as I had never\r\nseen any that were good, I was not aware of their beauty.\r\n\r\nI also took lessons in mineralogy from Mrs. Lowry, a Jewess, the wife of\r\nan eminent line engraver, who had a large collection of minerals, and in\r\nthe evening Somerville and I amused ourselves with our own, which were\r\nnot numerous.\r\n\r\nOur house in Hanover Square was within a walking distance of many of our\r\nfriends, and of the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street, where I\r\nattended the lectures, and Somerville frequently went with me. The\r\ndiscoveries of Sir Humphry Davy made this a memorable epoch in the\r\nannals of chemical science. At this time there was much talk about the\r\ncelebrated Count Rumford's steam kitchen, by which food was to be cooked\r\nat a very small expense of fuel. It was adopted by several people, and\r\namong others by Naldi, the opera singer, who invited some friends to\r\ndine the first day it was to be used. Before dinner they all went to see\r\nthe new invention, but while Naldi was explaining its structure,\r\nit exploded and killed him on the spot. By this sad accident his\r\ndaughter, a pretty girl and a good singer, was left destitute. A\r\nnumerously-attended concert was given for her benefit, at which\r\nSomerville and I were present. She was soon after engaged to sing in\r\nParis, but ultimately married the Comte de Sparre, a French gentleman,\r\nand left the stage.\r\n\r\nWhen MM. Arago and Biot came to England to continue the French arc of\r\nthe meridian through Great Britain, they were warmly received by the\r\nscientific men in London, and we were always invited to meet them by\r\nthose whom we knew. They had been told of my turn for science, and that\r\nI had read the works of La Place. Biot expressed his surprise at my\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOne summer Somerville proposed to make a tour in Switzerland, so we set\r\noff, and on arriving at Chantilly we were told that we might see the\r\nchâteau upon giving our cards to the doorkeeper. On reading our name,\r\nMademoiselle de Rohan came to meet us, saying that she had been at\r\nschool in England with a sister of Lord Somerville's, and was glad to\r\nsee any of the family. She presented us to the Prince de Condé, a\r\nfine-looking old man, who received us very courteously, and sent the\r\nlord-in-waiting to show us the grounds, and especially the stables, the\r\nonly part of the castle left in its regal magnificence after the\r\nRevolution. The Prince and the gentleman who accompanied us wore a gaudy\r\nuniform like a livery, which we were told was the Chantilly uniform, and\r\nthat at each palace belonging to the Prince there was a different\r\nuniform worn by him and his court.\r\n\r\nAt Paris we were received with the kindest hospitality by M. and Mme.\r\nArago. I liked her much, she was so gentle and ladylike; he was tall and\r\ngood-looking, with an animated countenance and black eyes. His character\r\nwas noble, generous, and singularly energetic; his manners lively and\r\neven gay. He was a man of very general information, and, from his\r\nexcitable temperament, he entered as ardently into the politics and\r\npassing events of the time as into science, in which few had more\r\nextensive knowledge. On this account I thought his conversation more\r\nbrilliant than that of any of the French savants with whom I was\r\nacquainted. They were living at the Observatory, and M. Arago showed me\r\nall the instruments of that magnificent establishment in the minutest\r\ndetail, which was highly interesting at the time, and proved more useful\r\nto me than I was aware of. M. Arago made us acquainted with the Marquis\r\nde la Place, and the Marquise, who was quite an _élégante_. The Marquis\r\nwas not tall, but thin, upright, and rather formal. He was distinguished\r\nin his manners, and I thought there was a little of the courtier in\r\nthem, perhaps from having been so much at the court of the Emperor\r\nNapoleon, who had the highest regard for him. Though incomparably\r\nsuperior to Arago in mathematics and astronomical science, he was\r\ninferior to him in general acquirements, so that his conversation was\r\nless varied and popular. We were invited to go early and spend a day\r\nwith them at Arcueil, where they had a country house. M. Arago had told\r\nM. de la Place that I had read the \"Mécanique Céleste,\" so we had a\r\ngreat deal of conversation about astronomy and the calculus, and he gave\r\nme a copy of his \"Système du Monde,\" with his inscription, which pleased\r\nme exceedingly. I spoke French very badly, but I was less at a loss on\r\nscientific subjects, because almost all my books on science were in\r\nFrench. The party at dinner consisted of MM. Biot, Arago, Bouvard, and\r\nPoisson. I sat next M. de la Place, who was exceedingly kind and\r\nattentive. In such an assemblage of philosophers I expected a very grave\r\nand learned conversation. But not at all! Everyone talked in a gay,\r\nanimated, and loud key, especially M. Poisson, who had all the vivacity\r\nof a Frenchman. Madame Biot, from whom we received the greatest\r\nattention, made a party on purpose, as she said, to show us, \"les\r\npersonnes distinguées.\" Madame Biot was a well-educated woman, and had\r\nmade a translation from the German of a work, which was published under\r\nthe name of her husband. The dinner was very good, and Madame Biot was\r\nat great pains in placing every one. Those present were Monsieur and\r\nMadame Arago, Monsieur and Madame Poisson, who had only been married the\r\nday before, and Baron Humboldt. The conversation was lively and\r\nentertaining.\r\n\r\nThe consulate and empire of the first Napoleon was the most brilliant\r\nperiod of physical astronomy in France. La Grange, who proved the\r\nstability of the solar system, Laplace, Biot, Arago, Bouvard, and\r\nafterwards Poinsot, formed a perfect constellation of undying names; yet\r\nthe French had been for many years inferior to the English in practical\r\nastronomy. The observations made at Greenwich by Bradley, Maskelyne, and\r\nPond, have been so admirably continued under the direction of the\r\npresent astronomer-royal, Mr. Airy, the first practical astronomer in\r\nEurope, that they have furnished data for calculating the astronomical\r\ntables both in France and England.\r\n\r\nThe theatre was at this time very brilliant in Paris. We saw Talma, who\r\nwas considered to be the first tragedian of the age in the character of\r\nTancrède. I admired the skill with which he overcame the disagreeable\r\neffect which the rhyme of the French tragedies has always had on me.\r\nNotwithstanding his personal advantages, I thought him a great artist,\r\nthough inferior to John Kemble. I am afraid my admiration of\r\nShakespeare, my want of sympathy with the artificial style of French\r\ntragedy, and perhaps my youthful remembrance of our great tragedian Mrs.\r\nSiddons, made me unjust to Mademoiselle Duchênois, who, although ugly,\r\nwas certainly an excellent actress and a favourite of the public. I was\r\nso fond of the theatre that I enjoyed comedy quite as much as tragedy,\r\nand was delighted with Mademoiselle Mars, whom we saw in Tartuffe. Some\r\nyears later I saw her again, when, although an old woman, she still\r\nappeared handsome and young upon the stage, and was as graceful and\r\nlively as ever.\r\n\r\nSoon after our dinner party at Arcueil, we went to pay a morning visit\r\nto Madame de la Place. It was late in the day; but she received us in\r\nbed elegantly dressed. I think the curtains were of muslin with some\r\ngold ornaments, and the coverlet was of rich silk and gold. It was the\r\nfirst time that I had ever seen a lady receive in that manner. Madame\r\nLaplace was lively and agreeable; I liked her very much.\r\n\r\nWe spent a most entertaining day with M. and Madame Cuvier at the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes, and saw the Museum, and everything in that celebrated\r\nestablishment. On returning to the house, we found several people had\r\ncome to spend the evening, and the conversation was carried on with a\r\ngood deal of spirit; the Countess Albrizzi, a Venetian lady, of high\r\nacquirements, joined in it with considerable talent and animation.\r\nCuvier had a very remarkable countenance, not handsome, but agreeable,\r\nand his manner was pleasing and modest, and his conversation very\r\ninteresting. Madame de Staël having died lately, was much discussed. She\r\nwas much praised for her good-nature, and for the brilliancy of her\r\nconversation. They agreed, that the energy of her character, not old\r\nage, had worn her out. Cuvier said, the force of her imagination misled\r\nher judgment, and made her see things in a light different from all the\r\nworld. As a proof of this, he mentioned that she makes Corinne lean on a\r\nmarble lion which is on a tomb in St. Peter's, at Rome, more than twenty\r\nfeet high. Education was very much discussed. Cuvier said, that when he\r\nwas sent to inspect the schools at Bordeaux and Marseilles, he found\r\nvery few of the scholars who could perform a simple calculation in\r\narithmetic; as to science, history, or literature, they were unknown,\r\nand the names of the most celebrated French philosophers, famed in other\r\ncountries, were utterly unknown to those who lived in the provinces. M.\r\nBiot had written home, that he had found in Aberdeen not one alone, but\r\nmany, who perfectly understood the object of his journey, and were\r\ncompetent to converse with him on the subject. Cuvier said such a\r\ncircumstance constituted one of the striking differences between France\r\nand England; for in France science was highly cultivated, but confined\r\nto the capital. It was at M. Cuvier's that I first met Mr. Pentland, who\r\nmade a series of physical and geological observations on the Andes of\r\nPeru. I was residing in Italy when I published my \"Physical Geography\"\r\nand Mr. Pentland[8] kindly undertook to carry the book through the press\r\nfor me. From that time he has been a steady friend, ever ready to get me\r\ninformation, books, or anything I wanted. We became acquainted also with\r\nM. Gay-Lussac, who lived in the Jardin des Plantes, and with Baron\r\nLarrey, who had been at the head of the medical department of the army\r\nin Egypt under the first Napoleon.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt Paris I equipped myself in proper dresses, and we proceeded by\r\nFontainebleau to Geneva, where we found Dr. Marcet, with whom my husband\r\nhad already been acquainted in London. I, for the first time, met Mrs.\r\nMarcet, with whom I have ever lived on terms of affectionate friendship.\r\nSo many books have now been published for young people, that no one at\r\nthis time can duly estimate the importance of Mrs. Marcet's scientific\r\nworks. To them is partly owing that higher intellectual education now\r\nbeginning to prevail among the better classes in Britain. They produced\r\na great sensation, and went through many editions. Her \"Conversations on\r\nChemistry,\" first opened out to Faraday's mind that field of science in\r\nwhich he became so illustrious, and at the height of his fame he always\r\nmentioned Mrs. Marcet with deep reverence.\r\n\r\nThrough these kind friends we became acquainted with Professors De\r\nCandolle, Prevost, and De la Rive. Other distinguished men were also\r\npresented to us; among these was Mr. Sismondi, author of the \"History of\r\nthe Italian Republics.\" Madame Sismondi was a Miss Allen, of a family\r\nwith whom we were very intimate.\r\n\r\n    [Some time after her return to England, my mother, desirous of\r\n    continuing the study of botany, in which she had already attained\r\n    considerable proficiency, wrote to M. De Candolle, asking his\r\n    advice, and he sent her the following reply:--]\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM M. DE CANDOLLE TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    LONDRES, _5 Juin, 1819_.\r\n\r\n    MADAME,\r\n\r\n    Vous avez passé les premières difficultés de l'étude des plantes et\r\n    vous me faites l'honneur de me consulter sur les moyens d'aller en\r\n    avant; connaissant votre goût et votre talent pour les sciences les\r\n    plus relevées je ne craindrai point de vous engager à sortir de la\r\n    Botanique élémentaire et à vous élever aux considérations et aux\r\n    études qui en font une science susceptible d'idées générales,\r\n    d'applications aux choses utiles et de liaison avec les autres\r\n    branches des connaissances humaines. Pour cela il faut étudier non\r\n    plus seulement la nomenclature et l'échafaudage artificiel qui la\r\n    soutient, mais les rapports des plantes entre elles et avec les\r\n    élémens extérieurs, ou en d'autres termes, la classification\r\n    naturelle et la Physiologie.\r\n\r\n    Pour l'un et l'autre de ces branches de la science il est nécessaire\r\n    en premier lieu de se familiariser avec la structure des plantes\r\n    considérée dans leur caractère exacte. Vous trouverez un précis\r\n    abrégé de ces caractères dans le 1^er vol. de la Flore française;\r\n    vous la trouverez plus développé et accompagné de planches dans les\r\n    Elémens de Botanique de Michel. Quant à la structure du fruit qui\r\n    est un des points les plus difficiles et les plus importans, vous\r\n    allez avoir un bon ouvrage traduit et augmenté par un de vos jeunes\r\n    et habiles compatriotes, Mr. Lindley--c'est l'analyse du fruit de M.\r\n    Richard. La traduction vaudra mieux que l'original. Outre ces\r\n    lectures, ce qui vous apprendra surtout la structure des plantes,\r\n    c'est de les analyser et de les décrire vous-même d'après les\r\n    termes techniques; ce travail deviendrait pénible et inutile à faire\r\n    sur un grand nombre de plantes, et il vaut mieux ne le faire que sur\r\n    un très petit nombre d'espèces choisies dans des classes très\r\n    distinctes. Quelques descriptions faites aussi complètes qu'il vous\r\n    sera possible vous apprendra plus que tous les livres.\r\n\r\n    Dès que vous connaîtrez bien les organes et concurremment avec cette\r\n    étude vous devrez chercher à prendre une idée de la classification\r\n    naturelle. Je crains de vous paraître présomptueux en vous engageant\r\n    à lire d'abord sous ce point de vue ma Théorie élémentaire. Après\r\n    ces études ou à peu près en même temps pour profiter de la saison,\r\n    vous ferez bien de rapporter aux ordres naturels toutes les plantes\r\n    que vous aurez recueillies. La lecture des caractères des familles\r\n    faites la plante à la main et l'acte de ranger vos plantes en\r\n    familles vous feront connaître par théorie et par pratique ces\r\n    groupes naturels. Je vous engage dans cette étude, surtout en le\r\n    commencement, à ne donner que peu d'attention au système général qui\r\n    lie les familles, mais beaucoup à la connaissance de la physionomie\r\n    qui est propre à chacune d'elles. Sous ce point de vue vous pourrez\r\n    trouver quelque intérêt à lire--1° les Tableaux de la Nature de M.\r\n    de Humboldt; 2° mon essai sur les propriétés des plantes comparées\r\n    avec leurs formes extérieures; 3° les remarques sur la géographie\r\n    botanique de la Nouvelle Hollande et de l'Afrique, insérés par M.\r\n    Robt. Brown à la fin du voyage de Finders et de l'expédition au\r\n    Congo.\r\n\r\n    Quant à l'étude de la Physiologie ou de la connaissance des\r\n    végétaux considérés comme êtres vivans, je vous engage à lire les\r\n    ouvrages dans l'ordre suivant: Philibert, Elémens de Bot. et de\r\n    Phys., 3 vols.; la 2^de partie des principes élémentaires de la Bot.\r\n    de la Flore française. Vous trouverez la partie anatomique dans\r\n    l'ouvrage de Mirbel; la partie chimique dans les recherches\r\n    chimiques sur la Veget. de T. de Saussure; la partie statique dans\r\n    la statique des végétaux de Hales, &c. &c. Mais je vous engage\r\n    surtout à voir par vous-même les plantes à tous leurs ages, à suivre\r\n    leur végétation, à les décrire en détail, en un mot à vivre avec\r\n    elles plus qu'avec les livres.\r\n\r\n    Je désire, madame, que ces conseils puissent vous engager à suivre\r\n    l'étude des plantes sous cette direction qui je crois en relève\r\n    beaucoup l'importance et l'intérêt. Je m'estimerai heureux si en\r\n    vous l'indiquant je puis concourir à vos succès futures et à vous\r\n    initier dans une étude que j'ai toujours regardé comme une de celles\r\n    qui peut le plus contribuer au bonheur journalier.\r\n\r\n    Je vous prie d'agréer mes hommages empressés.\r\n\r\n                                                 DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe had made the ordinary short tour through Switzerland, and had arrived\r\nat Lausanne on our way home, when I was taken ill with a severe fever\r\nwhich detained us there for many weeks. I shall never forget the\r\nkindness I received from two Miss Barclays, Quaker ladies, and a Miss\r\nFotheringham, who, on hearing of my illness, came and sat up alternate\r\nnights with me, as if I had been their sister.\r\n\r\nThe winter was now fast approaching, and Somerville thought that in my\r\nweak state a warm climate was necessary; so we arranged with our\r\nfriends, the Miss Barclays, to pass the Simplon together. We parted\r\ncompany at Milan, but we renewed our friendship in London.\r\n\r\nWe went to Monza, and saw the iron crown; and there I found the Magnolia\r\ngrandiflora, which hitherto I had only known as a greenhouse plant,\r\nrising almost into a forest tree.\r\n\r\nAt Venice we renewed our acquaintance with the Countess Albrizzi, who\r\nreceived every evening. It was at these receptions that we saw Lord\r\nByron, but he would not make the acquaintance of any English people at\r\nthat time. When he came into the room I did not perceive his lameness,\r\nand thought him strikingly like my brother Henry, who was remarkably\r\nhandsome. I said to Somerville, \"Is Lord Byron like anyone you know?\"\r\n\"Your brother Henry, decidedly.\" Lord Broughton, then Sir John Cam\r\nHobhouse, was also present.\r\n\r\nAt Florence, I was presented to the Countess of Albany, widow of Prince\r\nCharles Edward Stuart the Pretender. She was then supposed to be married\r\nto Alfieri the poet, and had a kind of state reception every evening. I\r\ndid not like her, and never went again. Her manner was proud and\r\ninsolent. \"So you don't speak Italian; you must have had a very bad\r\neducation, for Miss Clephane Maclane there [who was close by] speaks\r\nboth French and Italian perfectly.\" So saying, she turned away, and\r\nnever addressed another word to me. That evening I recognised in\r\nCountess Moretti my old friend Agnes Bonar. Moretti was of good family;\r\nbut, having been banished from home for political opinions, he taught\r\nthe guitar in London for bread, and an attachment was formed between him\r\nand his pupil. After the murder of her parents, they were both\r\npersecuted with the most unrelenting cruelty by her brother. They\r\nescaped to Milan where they were married.\r\n\r\nI was still a young woman; but I thought myself too old to learn to\r\nspeak a foreign language, consequently I did not try. I spoke French\r\nbadly; and now, after several years' residence in Italy, although I can\r\ncarry on a conversation fluently in Italian, I do not speak it well.\r\n\r\n    [When my mother first went abroad, she had no fluency in talking\r\n    French, although she was well acquainted with the literature. To\r\n    show how, at every period of her life, she missed no opportunity of\r\n    acquiring information or improvement, I may mention that many years\r\n    after, when we were spending a summer in Siena, where the language\r\n    is spoken with great purity and elegance, she engaged a lady to\r\n    converse in Italian with her for a couple of hours daily. By this\r\n    means she very soon became perfectly familiar with the language,\r\n    and could keep up conversation in Italian without difficulty. She\r\n    never cared to write in any language but English. Her style has been\r\n    reckoned particularly clear and good, and she was complimented on it\r\n    by various competent judges, although she herself was always\r\n    diffident about her writings, saying she was only a self-taught,\r\n    uneducated Scotchwoman, and feared to use Scotch idioms\r\n    inadvertently. In speaking she had a very decided but pleasant\r\n    Scotch accent, and when aroused and excited, would often\r\n    unconsciously use not only native idioms, but quaint old Scotch\r\n    words. Her voice was soft and low, and her manner earnest.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn our way to Rome, where we spent the winter of 1817, it was startling\r\nto see the fine church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, below Assisi, cut in\r\ntwo; half of the church and half of the dome above it were still entire;\r\nthe rest had been thrown down by the earthquake which had destroyed the\r\nneighbouring town of Foligno, and committed such ravages in this part of\r\nUmbria.\r\n\r\nAt that time I might have been pardoned if I had described St Peter's,\r\nthe Vatican, and the innumerable treasures of art and antiquity at Rome;\r\nbut now that they are so well known it would be ridiculous and\r\nsuperfluous. Here I gained a little more knowledge about pictures; but I\r\npreferred sculpture, partly from the noble specimens of Greek art I saw\r\nin Paris and Rome, and partly because I was such an enthusiast about the\r\nlanguage and everything belonging to ancient Greece. During this journey\r\nI was highly gratified, for we made the acquaintance of Thorwaldsen and\r\nCanova. Canova was gentle and amiable, with a beautiful countenance, and\r\nwas an artist of great reputation. Thorwaldsen had a noble and striking\r\nappearance, and had more power and originality than Canova. His\r\nbas-reliefs were greatly admired. I saw the one he made of Night in the\r\nhouse of an English lady, who had a talent for modelling, and was said\r\nto be attached to him. We were presented to Pope Pius the Seventh; a\r\nhandsome, gentlemanly, and amiable old man. He received us in a\r\nsummer-house in the garden of the Vatican. He was sitting on a sofa, and\r\nmade me sit beside him. His manners were simple and very gracious; he\r\nspoke freely of what he had suffered in France. He said, \"God forbid\r\nthat he should bear ill-will to any one; but the journey and the cold\r\nwere trying to an old man, and he was glad to return to a warm climate\r\nand to his own country.\" When we took leave, he said to me, \"Though a\r\nProtestant, you will be none the worse for an old man's blessing.\" Pius\r\nthe Seventh was loved and respected; the people knelt to him as he\r\npassed. Many years afterwards we were presented to Gregory the\r\nSixteenth, a very common-looking man, forming a great contrast to Pius\r\nthe Seventh.\r\n\r\nI heard more good music during this first visit to Rome than I ever did\r\nafter; for besides that usual in St. Peter's, there was an Academia\r\nevery week, where Marcello's Psalms were sung in concert by a number of\r\nmale voices, besides other concerts, private and public. We did not make\r\nthe acquaintance of any of the Roman families at this time; but we saw\r\nPauline Borghese, sister of the Emperor Napoleon, so celebrated for her\r\nbeauty, walking on the Pincio every afternoon. Our great geologist, Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison, with his wife, were among the English residents at\r\nRome. At that time he hardly knew one stone from another. He had been an\r\nofficer in the Dragoons, an excellent horseman, and a keen fox-hunter.\r\nLady Murchison,--an amiable and accomplished woman, with solid\r\nacquirements which few ladies at that time possessed--had taken to the\r\nstudy of geology; and soon after her husband began that career which has\r\nrendered him the first geologist of our country. It was then that a\r\nfriendship began between them and us, which will only end with life.\r\nMrs. Fairfax, of Gilling Castle, and her two handsome daughters were\r\nalso at Rome. She was my namesake--Mary Fairfax--and my valued friend\r\ntill her death. Now, alas! many of these friends are gone.\r\n\r\nThere were such troops of brigands in the Papal States, that it was\r\nconsidered unsafe to go outside the gates of Rome. They carried off\r\npeople to the mountains, and kept them till ransomed; sometimes even\r\nmutilated them, as they do at the present day in the kingdom of Naples.\r\nLucien Bonaparte made a narrow escape from being carried off from his\r\nvilla, Villa Ruffinella, near Frascati. When it could be proved that\r\nbrigands had committed murder, they were confined in prisons in the\r\nMaremma, at Campo Morto, where fever prevails, and where they were\r\nsupposed to die of malaria. I saw Gasperone, the chief of a famous band,\r\nin a prison at Civita Vecchia; he was said to be a relative of Cardinal\r\nAntonelli, both coming from the brigand village of Sonnino, in the\r\nVolscian mountains. In going to Naples our friends advised us to take a\r\nguard of soldiers; but these were suspected of being as bad, and in\r\nleague with the brigands. So we travelled post without them; and though\r\nI foolishly insisted on going round by the ruins of ancient Capua, which\r\nwas considered very unsafe, we arrived at Naples without any encounter.\r\nHere we met with the son and daughter of Mr. Smith, of Norwich, a\r\ncelebrated leader in the anti-slavery question. This was a bond of\r\ninterest between his family and me; for when I was a girl I took the\r\nanti-slavery cause so warmly to heart that I would not take sugar in my\r\ntea, or indeed taste anything with sugar in it. I was not singular in\r\nthis, for my cousins and many of my acquaintances came to the same\r\nresolution. How long we kept it I do not remember. Patty Smith and I\r\nbecame great friends, and I knew her sisters; but only remember her\r\nniece Florence Nightingale as a very little child. My friend Patty was\r\nliberal in her opinions, witty, original, an excellent horsewoman, and\r\ndrew cleverly; but from bad health she was peculiar in all her habits.\r\nShe was a good judge of art. Her father had a valuable collection of\r\npictures of the ancient masters; and I learnt much from her with regard\r\nto paintings and style in drawing. We went to see everything in Naples\r\nand its environs together, and she accompanied Somerville and me in an\r\nexpedition to Pæstum, where we made sketches of the temples. At Naples\r\nwe bought a beautiful cork model of the Temple of Neptune, which was\r\nplaced on our mineral cabinet on our return to London. A lady who came\r\nto pay me a morning visit asked Somerville what it was; and when he told\r\nher, she said, \"How dreadful it is to think that all the people who\r\nworshipped in that temple are in eternal misery, because they did not\r\nbelieve in our Saviour.\" Somerville asked, \"How could they believe in\r\nChrist when He was not born till many centuries after?\" I am sure she\r\nthought it was all the same.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThere had been an eruption of Vesuvius just before our arrival at\r\nNaples, and it was still smoking very much; however, we ascended it, and\r\nwalked round the crater, running and holding a handkerchief to our nose\r\nan we passed through the smoke, when the wind blew it to our side. The\r\ncrater was just like an empty funnel, wide at the mouth, and narrowing\r\nto a throat. The lava was hard enough to bear us; but there were\r\nnumerous _fumeroles_ or red-hot chasms, in it, which we could look into.\r\nSomerville bought a number of crystals from the guides, and went\r\nrepeatedly to Portici afterwards to complete our collection of volcanic\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThey were excavating busily at Pompeii; at that time, and in one of our\r\nmany excursions there Somerville bought from one of the workmen a bronze\r\nstatuette of Minerva, and a very fine rosso antico Terminus, which we\r\ncontrived to smuggle into Naples; and it now forms part of a small but\r\nexcellent collection of antiques which I still possess. The excavations\r\nat that period were conducted with little regularity or direction, and\r\nthe guides were able to carry on a contraband trade as mentioned. Since\r\nthe annexation of the Neapolitan provinces to the kingdom of Italy, the\r\nCavaliere Fiorelli has organized the system of excavations in the most\r\nmasterly manner, and has made many interesting discoveries. About\r\none-third of the town has been excavated since it was discovered till\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nIn passing through Bologna, we became acquainted with the celebrated\r\nMezzofanti, afterwards Cardinal. He was a quiet-looking priest; we could\r\nnot see anything in his countenance that indicated talent, nor was his\r\nconversation remarkable; yet he told us that he understood fifty-two\r\nlanguages. He left no memoir at his death; nor did he ever trace any\r\nconnection between these languages; it was merely an astonishing power,\r\nwhich led to nothing, like that of a young American I lately heard of,\r\nwho could play eleven games at chess at the same time, without looking\r\nat any chess-board.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Joseph Barclay Pentland, Consul-General in Bolivia\r\n(1836-39), died in London, July, 1873. He first discovered that Illimani\r\nand Sorata (not Chimborazo) were the highest mountains in America. (See\r\nHumboldt's \"Kosmos.\")]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION OF DAUGHTERS--DR. WOLLASTON--DR. YOUNG--THE HERSCHELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to Hanover Square, I devoted my morning hours, as\r\nusual, to domestic affairs; but now my children occupied a good deal of\r\nmy time. Although still very young, I thought it advisable for them to\r\nacquire foreign languages; so I engaged a French nursery-maid, that they\r\nmight never suffer what I had done from ignorance of modern languages. I\r\nbesides gave them instruction in such things as I was capable of\r\nteaching, and which were suited to their age.\r\n\r\nIt was a great amusement to Somerville and myself to arrange the\r\nminerals we had collected during our journey. Our cabinet was now very\r\nrich. Some of our specimens we had bought; our friends had given us\r\nduplicates of those they possessed; and George Finlayson, who was with\r\nour troops in Ceylon, and who had devoted all his spare time to the\r\nstudy of the natural productions of the country, sent us a valuable\r\ncollection of crystals of sapphire, ruby, oriental topaz, amethyst, &c.,\r\n&c. Somerville used to analyze minerals with the blowpipe, which I never\r\ndid. One evening, when he was so occupied, I was playing the piano, when\r\nsuddenly I fainted; he was very much startled, as neither I nor any of\r\nour family had ever done such a thing. When I recovered, I said it was\r\nthe smell of garlic that had made me ill. The truth was, the mineral\r\ncontained arsenic, and I was poisoned for the time by the fumes.\r\n\r\nAt this time we formed an acquaintance with Dr. Wollaston, which soon\r\nbecame a lasting friendship. He was gentlemanly, a cheerful companion,\r\nand a philosopher; he was also of agreeable appearance, having a\r\nremarkably fine, intellectual head. He was essentially a chemist, and\r\ndiscovered palladium; but there were few branches of science with which\r\nhe was not more or less acquainted. He made experiments to discover\r\nimponderable matter; I believe, with regard to the ethereal medium. Mr.\r\nBrand, of the Royal Institution, enraged him by sending so strong a\r\ncurrent of electricity through a machine he had made to prove\r\nelectro-magnetic rotation, as to destroy it. His characteristic was\r\nextreme accuracy, which particularly fitted him for giving that\r\nprecision to the science of crystallography which it had not hitherto\r\nattained. By the invention of the goniometer which bears his name, he\r\nwas enabled to measure the angle formed by the faces of a crystal by\r\nmeans of the reflected images of bright objects seen in them. We bought\r\na goniometer, and Dr. Wollaston, who often dined with us, taught\r\nSomerville and me how to use it, by measuring the angles of many of our\r\ncrystals during the evening. I learnt a great deal on a variety of\r\nsubjects besides crystallography from Dr. Wollaston, who, at his death,\r\nleft me a collection of models of the forms of all the natural crystals\r\nthen known.\r\n\r\nThough still occasionally occupied with the mineral productions of the\r\nearth, I became far more interested in the formation of the earth\r\nitself. Geologists had excited public attention, and had shocked the\r\nclergy and the more scrupulous of the laity by proving beyond a doubt\r\nthat the formation of the globe extended through enormous periods of\r\ntime. The contest was even more keen then than it is at the present time\r\nabout the various races of prehistoric men. It lasted very long, too;\r\nfor after I had published my work on Physical Geography, I was preached\r\nagainst by name in York Cathedral. Our friend, Dr. Buckland, committed\r\nhimself by taking the clerical view in his \"Bridgewater Treatise;\" but\r\nfacts are such stubborn things that he was obliged to join the\r\ngeologists at last. He and Mrs. Buckland invited Somerville and me to\r\nspend a week with them in Christchurch College, Oxford. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMurchison were their guests at the same time. Mr. Murchison (now Sir\r\nRoderick) was then rising rapidly to the pre-eminence he now holds as a\r\ngeologist. We spent every day in seeing some of the numerous objects of\r\ninterest in that celebrated university, venerable for its antiquity,\r\nhistorical records, and noble architecture.\r\n\r\nSomerville and I used frequently to spend the evening with Captain and\r\nMrs. Kater. Dr. Wollaston, Dr. Young, and others were generally of the\r\nparty; sometimes we had music, for Captain and Mrs. Kater sang very\r\nprettily. All kinds of scientific subjects were discussed, experiments\r\ntried and astronomical observations made in a little garden in front of\r\nthe house. One evening we had been trying the power of a telescope in\r\nseparating double stars till about two in the morning; on our way home\r\nwe saw a light in Dr. Young's window, and when Somerville rang the bell,\r\ndown came the doctor himself in his dressing-gown, and said, \"Come in; I\r\nhave something curious to show you.\" Astronomical signs are frequently\r\nfound on ancient Egyptian monuments, and were supposed to have been\r\nemployed by the priests to record dates. Now Dr. Young had received a\r\npapyrus from Egypt, sent to him by Mr. Salt, who had found it in a\r\nmummy-case; and that very evening he had proved it to be a horoscope of\r\nthe age of the Ptolemies, and had determined the date from the\r\nconfiguration of the heavens at the time of its construction. Dr. Young\r\nhad already made himself famous by the interpretation of hieroglyphic\r\ncharacters on a stone which had been brought to the British Museum from\r\nRosetta in Egypt. On that stone there is an inscription in\r\nHieroglyphics, the sacred symbolic language of the early Egyptians;\r\nanother in the Enchorial or spoken language of that most ancient people,\r\nand a mutilated inscription in Greek. By the aid of some fragments of\r\npapyri Dr. Young discovered that the Enchorial language is alphabetical,\r\nand that nine of its letters correspond with ours; moreover, he\r\ndiscovered such a relation between the Enchorial and the hieroglyphic\r\ninscription that he interpreted the latter and published his discoveries\r\nin the years 1815 and 1816.\r\n\r\nM. Champollion, who had been on the same pursuit, examined the fine\r\ncollection of papyri in the museum at Turin, and afterwards went to\r\nEgypt to pursue his studies on hieroglyphics, to our knowledge of which\r\nhe contributed greatly. It is to be regretted that one who had brought\r\nthat branch of science to such perfection should have been so\r\nungenerous as to ignore the assistance he had received from the\r\nresearches of Dr. Young. When the Royal Institution was first\r\nestablished, Dr. Young lectured on natural philosophy. He proved the\r\nundulatory theory of light by direct experiment, but as it depended upon\r\nthe hypothesis of an ethereal medium, it was not received in England,\r\nthe more so as it was contrary to Newton's theory. The French _savants_\r\nafterwards did Young ample justice. The existence of the ethereal medium\r\nis now all but proved, since part of the corona surrounding the moon\r\nduring a total solar eclipse is polarized--a phenomenon depending on\r\nmatter. Young's Lectures, which had been published, were a mine of\r\nriches to me. He was of a Quaker family; but although he left the\r\nSociety of Friends at an early age, he retained their formal precision\r\nof manner to the last. He was of a kindly disposition, and his wife and\r\nher sisters, with whom I was intimate, were much attached to him. Dr.\r\nYoung was an elegant and critical scholar at a very early age; he was an\r\nastronomer, a mathematician, and there were few branches of science in\r\nwhich he was not versed. When young, his Quaker habits did not prevent\r\nhim from taking lessons in music and dancing. I have heard him accompany\r\nhis sister-in-law with the flute, while she played the piano. When not\r\nmore than sixteen years of age he was so remarkable for steadiness and\r\nacquirements that he was engaged more as a companion than tutor to young\r\nHudson Gurney, who was nearly of his own age. One spring morning Young\r\ncame to breakfast in a bright green coat, and said in explanation of his\r\nsomewhat eccentric costume for one who had been a Quaker, that it was\r\nsuitable to the season. One day, on returning from their ride Gurney,\r\nleaped his horse over the stable-yard gate. Young, trying to do the\r\nsame, was thrown; he got up, mounted, and made a second attempt with no\r\nbetter success; the third time he kept his seat, then quietly\r\ndismounting, he said, \"What one man can do, another may.\"\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOne bright morning Dr. Wollaston came to pay us a visit in Hanover\r\nSquare, saying, \"I have discovered seven dark lines crossing the solar\r\nspectrum, which I wish to show you;\" then, closing the window-shutters\r\nso as to leave only a narrow line of light, he put a small glass prism\r\ninto my hand, telling me how to hold it. I saw them distinctly. I was\r\namong the first, if not the very first, to whom he showed these lines,\r\nwhich were the origin of the most wonderful series of cosmical\r\ndiscoveries, and have proved that many of the substances of our globe\r\nare also constituents of the sun, the stars, and even of the nebulæ.\r\nDr. Wollaston gave me the little prism, which is doubly valuable, being\r\nof glass manufactured at Munich by Fraunhofer, whose table of dark lines\r\nhas now become the standard of comparison in that marvellous science,\r\nthe work of many illustrious men, brought to perfection by Bunsen and\r\nKirchhoff.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel had discovered that what appeared to be single\r\nstars were frequently two stars in such close approximation that it\r\nrequired a very high telescopic power to see them separately, and that\r\nin many of these one star was revolving in an orbit round the other. Sir\r\nJames South established an observatory at Campden Hill, near Kensington,\r\nwhere he and Sir John Herschel united in observing the double stars and\r\nbinary systems with the view of affording further data for improving our\r\nknowledge of their movements. In each two observations are requisite,\r\nnamely, the distance between the two stars, and the angle of position,\r\nthat is, the angle which the meridian, or a parallel to the equator\r\nmakes with the lines joining the two stars. These observations were made\r\nby adjusting a micrometer to a very powerful telescope, and were data\r\nsufficient for the determination of the orbit of the revolving star,\r\nshould it be a binary system. I have given an account of this in the\r\n\"Connexion of the Physical Sciences,\" so I shall only mention here that\r\nin one or two of the binary systems the revolving star has been seen to\r\nmake more than one revolution, and that the periodical times and the\r\nelliptical elements of a great many other orbits have been calculated,\r\nthough they are more than 200,000 times farther from the sun than we\r\nare.\r\n\r\nAfter Sir John Herschel was married, we paid him a visit at Slough;\r\nfortunately, the sky was clear, and Sir John had the kindness to show me\r\nmany nebulæ and clusters of stars which I had never seen to such\r\nadvantage as in his 20 ft. telescope. I shall never forget the glorious\r\nappearance of Jupiter as he entered the field of that instrument.\r\n\r\nFor years the British nation was kept in a state of excitement by the\r\nArctic voyages of our undaunted seamen in quest of a north-west passage\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The idea was not new, for a\r\ndirect way to our Eastern possessions had been long desired. On this\r\noccasion the impulse was given by William Scoresby, captain of a whaler,\r\nwho had sailed on the east coast of Greenland as high as the 80th\r\nparallel of latitude, and for two successive seasons had found that the\r\nsea between Greenland and Spitzbergen was free of ice for 18,000 square\r\nmiles--a circumstance which had not occurred before in the memory of\r\nman. Scoresby was of rare genius, well versed in science, and of strict\r\nprobity. When he published this discovery, the Admiralty, in the year\r\n1818, sent off two expeditions, one under the command of Captains\r\nFranklin and Buchan to the east of Greenland, and another under Captains\r\nRoss and Parry to Baffin's Bay. Such was the beginning of a series of\r\nnoble adventures, now the province of history.\r\n\r\nI had an early passion for everything relating to the sea, and when my\r\nfather was at home I never tired asking him questions about his voyages\r\nand the dangers to which he had been exposed. Now, when I knew something\r\nof nautical science, I entered with enthusiasm into the spirit of these\r\nArctic voyages; nor was my husband less interested. We read Scoresby's\r\nwhaling voyages with great delight, and we made the acquaintance of all\r\nthe officers who had been on these northern expeditions.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Parry, who had brought us minerals and seeds of plants from\r\nMelville Island, invited us to see the ships prepared for his third\r\nvoyage, and three years' residence in the Arctic seas. It is impossible\r\nto describe how perfectly everything was arranged: experience had taught\r\nthem what was necessary for such an expedition. On this occasion I put\r\nin practice my lessons in cookery by making a large quantity of orange\r\nmarmalade for the voyage. When, after three years, the ships returned,\r\nwe were informed that the name of Somerville had been given to an island\r\nso far to the north that it was all but perpetually covered with ice and\r\nsnow. Notwithstanding the sameness which naturally prevails in the\r\nnarratives of these voyages, they are invested with a romantic interest\r\nby the daring bravery displayed, and by the appalling difficulties\r\novercome. The noble endeavour of Lady Franklin to save her gallant\r\nhusband, and the solitary voyage of Sir Leopold McClintock in a small\r\nyacht in search of his lost friend, form the touching and sad\r\ntermination to a very glorious period of maritime adventure. More than\r\nfifty years after these events I renewed my acquaintance with Lady\r\nFranklin. She and her niece came to see me at Spezia on their way to\r\nDalmatia. She had circumnavigated the globe with her husband when he was\r\ngovernor in Australia. After his loss she and her niece had gone round\r\nthe world a second time, and she assured me that although they went to\r\nJapan and China (less known at that time than they are now), they never\r\nexperienced any difficulty. Seeing ladies travelling alone, people were\r\nalways willing to help them. The French sent a Polar expedition under\r\nCaptain Gaimard in the years 1838 and 1839; and the United States of\r\nNorth America took an active part in Arctic exploration. Whether Dr.\r\nKane's discovery of an open polar ocean will ever be verified is\r\nproblematical; at all events, the deplorable fate of Sir John Franklin\r\nhas put a stop to the chance of it for the present; yet it is a great\r\ngeographical question which we should all like to see decided.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sabine, of the Artillery (now General Sir Edward Sabine,\r\nPresident of the Royal Society), was appointed to accompany the first\r\nexpedition under Captains Ross and Parry on account of his high\r\nscientific acquirements. The observations made during the series of\r\nArctic voyages on the magnetism of the earth, combined with an enormous\r\nmass of observations made by numerous observers in all parts of the\r\nglobe by sea and by land, have enabled Sir Edward Sabine, after a labour\r\nof nearly fifty years, to complete his marvellous system of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism in both hemispheres. During that long period a friendship has\r\nlasted between Sir Edward and me. He has uniformly sent me copies of all\r\nhis works; to them I chiefly owe what I know on the subject, and quite\r\nrecently I have received his latest and most important publication. Sir\r\nEdward married a lady of talent and scientific acquirements. She\r\ntranslated \"Cosmos\" from the German, and assisted and calculated for\r\nher husband in his laborious work.\r\n\r\nI do not remember the exact period, but I think it was subsequent to the\r\nArctic voyages, that the theory was discovered of those tropical\r\nhurricanes which cause such devastation by sea and land. Observations\r\nare now made on barometric pressure, and warnings are sent to our\r\nprincipal seaports by telegraph, as well as along both sides of the\r\nChannel; but notwithstanding numerous disastrous shipwrecks occur every\r\nwinter on our dangerous coasts. They were far more numerous in my\r\nyounger days. Life-boats were not then invented; now they are stationed\r\non almost every coast of Great Britain, and on many continental shores.\r\nThe readiness with which they are manned, and the formidable dangers\r\nencountered to save life, show the gallant, noble character of the\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSOCIETY IN LONDON--CORONATION OF GEORGE IV.--LETTER TO DR. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went frequently to see Mr. Babbage while he was making his\r\nCalculating-machines. He had a transcendant intellect, unconquerable\r\nperseverance, and extensive knowledge on many subjects, besides being a\r\nfirst-rate mathematician. I always found him most amiable and patient in\r\nexplaining the structure and use of the engines. The first he made could\r\nonly perform arithmetical operations. Not satisfied with that, Mr.\r\nBabbage constructed an analytical engine, which could be so arranged as\r\nto perform all kinds of mathematical calculations, and print each\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nNothing has afforded me so convincing a proof of the unity of the Deity\r\nas these purely mental conceptions of numerical and mathematical science\r\nwhich have been by slow degrees vouchsafed to man, and are still granted\r\nin these latter times by the Differential Calculus and the Higher\r\nAlgebra, all of which must have existed in that sublimely omniscient\r\nMind from eternity.\r\n\r\nMany of our friends had very decided and various religious opinions, but\r\nmy husband and I never entered into controversy; we had too high a\r\nregard for liberty of conscience to interfere with any one's opinions,\r\nso we have lived on terms of sincere friendship and love with people who\r\ndiffered essentially from us in religious views, and in all the books\r\nwhich I have written I have confined myself strictly and entirely to\r\nscientific subjects, although my religious opinions are very decided.\r\n\r\nTimidity of character, probably owing to early education, had a great\r\ninfluence on my daily life; for I did not assume my place in society in\r\nmy younger days; and in argument I was instantly silenced, although I\r\noften knew, and could have proved, that I was in the right. The only\r\nthing in which I was determined and inflexible was in the prosecution of\r\nmy studies. They were perpetually interrupted, but always resumed at the\r\nfirst opportunity. No analysis is so difficult as that of one's own\r\nmind, but I do not think I err much in saying that perseverance is a\r\ncharacteristic of mine.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSomerville and I were very happy when we lived in Hanover Square. We\r\nwere always engaged in some pursuit, and had good society. General\r\nsociety was at that time brilliant for wit and talent. The Rev. Sidney\r\nSmith, Rogers, Thomas Moore, Campbell, the Hon. William Spencer,\r\nMacaulay, Sir James Mackintosh, Lord Melbourne, &c., &c., all made the\r\ndinner-parties very agreeable. The men sat longer at table than they do\r\nnow, and, except in the families where I was intimate, the conversation\r\nof the ladies in the drawing-room, when we came up from dinner, often\r\nbored me. I disliked routs exceedingly, and should often have sent an\r\nexcuse if I had known what to say. After my marriage I did not dance,\r\nfor in Scotland it was thought highly indecorous for a married woman to\r\ndance. Waltzing, when first introduced, was looked upon with horror, and\r\neven in England it was then thought very improper.\r\n\r\nOne season I subscribed to the Concerts of Ancient Music, established by\r\nGeorge the Third. They seemed to be the resort of the aged; a young face\r\nwas scarcely to be seen. The music was perfect of its kind, but the\r\nwhole affair was very dull. The Philharmonic Concerts were excellent for\r\nscientific musicians, and I sometimes went to them; but for my part I\r\ninfinitely preferred hearing Pasta, Malibran, and Grisi, who have left\r\nthe most vivid impression on my mind, although so different from each\r\nother. Somerville enjoyed a comic opera exceedingly, and so did I; and\r\nat that time Lablache was in the height of his fame. When Somerville and\r\nI made the tour in Italy already mentioned, we visited Catalani (then\r\nMadame Valabrèque) in a villa near Florence, to which she retired in her\r\nold age. She, however, died in Paris, of cholera, some years later.\r\n\r\nSomerville liked the theatre as much as I did; so we saw all the\r\ngreatest actors of the day, both in tragedy and comedy, and the English\r\ntheatre was then excellent. Young, who was scarcely inferior to John\r\nKemble, Macready, Kean, Liston, &c., and Miss O'Neill, who after a short\r\nbrilliant career entered into domestic life on her marriage with Sir\r\nWilliam Beecher, were all at the height of their fame. It was then I\r\nbecame acquainted with Lady Beecher, who was so simple and natural that\r\nno one could have discovered she had ever been on the stage. A very\r\nclever company of French comedians acted in a temporary theatre in\r\nTottenham Court Road, where we frequently went with a party of friends,\r\nand enjoyed very pleasant evenings. I think my fondness for the theatre\r\ndepended to a certain degree on my silent disposition; for unless among\r\nintimate friends, or when much excited, I was startled at the sound of\r\nmy own voice in general conversation, from the shyness which has\r\nhaunted me through life, and starts up occasionally like a ghost in my\r\nold age. At a play I was not called upon to make any exertion, but could\r\nenjoy at my ease an intellectual pleasure for the most part far superior\r\nto the general run of conversation.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAmong many others, we were intimate with Dr. and Mrs. Baillie and his\r\nsisters. Joanna was my dear and valued friend to the end of her life.\r\nWhen her tragedy of \"Montfort\" was to be brought on the stage,\r\nSomerville and I, with a large party of her relations and friends, went\r\nwith her to the theatre. The play was admirably acted, for Mrs. Siddons\r\nand her brother John Kemble performed the principal parts. It was warmly\r\napplauded by a full house, but it was never acted again. Some time\r\nafterwards \"The Family Legend,\" founded on a Highland story, had better\r\nsuccess in Edinburgh; but Miss Baillie's plays, though highly poetical,\r\nare not suited to the stage. Miss Mitford was more successful, for some\r\nof her plays were repeatedly acted. She excelled also as a writer. \"Our\r\nVillage\" is perfect of its kind; nothing can be more animated than her\r\ndescription of a game of cricket. I met with Miss Austin's novels at\r\nthis time, and thought them excellent, especially \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\r\nIt certainly formed a curious contrast to my old favourites, the\r\nRadcliffe novels and the ghost stories; but I had now come to years of\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nAmong my Quaker friends I met with that amiable but eccentric person\r\nMrs. Opie. Though a \"wet\" Quakeress, she continued to wear the peculiar\r\ndress. I was told that she was presented in it at the Tuileries, and\r\nastonished the French ladies. We were also acquainted with Mrs. Fry, a\r\nvery different person, and heard her preach. Her voice was fine, her\r\ndelivery admirable, and her prayer sublime. We were intimate with Mr.\r\n(now Sir Charles) Lyell, who, if I mistake not, first met with his wife\r\nat our house, where she was extremely admired as the beautiful Miss\r\nHorner. Until we lost all our fortune, and went to live at Chelsea, I\r\nused to have little evening parties in Hanover Square.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI was not present at the coronation of George the Fourth; but I had a\r\nticket for the gallery in Westminster Hall, to see the banquet. Though I\r\nwent very early in the morning, I found a wonderful confusion. I showed\r\nmy ticket of admission to one official person after another; the answer\r\nalways was \"I know nothing about it.\" At last I got a good place near\r\nsome ladies I knew; even at that early hour the gallery was full. Some\r\ntime after the ceremony in the Abbey was over, the door of the\r\nmagnificent hall was thrown open, and the king entered in the flowing\r\ncurls and costume of Henry the Eighth, and, imitating the jaunty manner\r\nof that monarch, walked up the hall and sat down on the throne at its\r\nextremity. The peeresses had already taken their seats under the\r\ngallery, and the king was followed by the peers, and the knights of the\r\nGarter, Bath, Thistle, and St. Patrick, all in their robes. After every\r\none had taken his seat, the Champion, on his horse, both in full armour,\r\nrode up the hall, and threw down a gauntlet before the king, while the\r\nheralds proclaimed that he was ready to do battle with any one who\r\ndenied that George the Fourth was the liege lord of these realms. Then\r\nvarious persons presented offerings to the king in right of which they\r\nheld their estates. One gentleman presented a beautiful pair of falcons\r\nin their hoods. While this pageantry and noise was at its height, Queen\r\nCaroline demanded to be admitted. There was a sudden silence and\r\nconsternation,--it was like the \"handwriting on the wall!\" The sensation\r\nwas intense. At last the order was given to refuse her admittance; the\r\npageantry was renewed, and the banquet followed. The noise, heat, and\r\nvivid light of the illumination of the hall gave me a racking headache;\r\nat last I went out of the gallery and sat on a stair, where there was a\r\nlittle fresh air, and was very glad when all was over. Years afterwards\r\nI was present in Westminster Abbey at the coronation of our Queen, then\r\na pretty young girl of eighteen. Placed in the most trying position at\r\nthat early age, by her virtues, both public and private, she has\r\nendeared herself to the nation beyond what any sovereign ever did\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI, who had so many occupations and duties at home, soon tired of the\r\nidleness and formality of visiting in the country. I made an exception,\r\nhowever, in favour of an occasional visit to Mr. Sotheby, the poet, and\r\nhis family in Epping Forest, of which, if I mistake not, he was\r\ndeputy-ranger; at all events, he had a pretty cottage there where he and\r\nhis family received their friends with kind hospitality. He spent part\r\nof the day in his study, and afterwards I have seen him playing cricket\r\nwith his son and grandson, with as much vivacity as any of them. The\r\nfreshness of the air was quite reviving to Somerville and me; and our\r\ntwo little girls played in the forest all the day.\r\n\r\nWe also gladly went for several successive years to visit Sir John\r\nSaunders Sebright at Beechwood Park, Hertfordshire. Dr. Wollaston\r\ngenerally travelled with us on these occasions, when we had much\r\nconversation on a variety of subjects, scientific or general. He was\r\nremarkably acute in his observations on objects as we passed them. \"Look\r\nat that ash tree; did you ever notice that the branches of the ash tree\r\nare curves of double curvature?\" There was a comet visible at the time\r\nof one of these little journeys. Dr. Wollaston had made a drawing of the\r\norbit and its elements; but, having left it in town, he described the\r\nlines so accurately without naming them, that I remarked at once, \"That\r\nis the curtate or perihelion distance,\" which pleased him greatly, as it\r\nshowed how accurate his description was. He was a chess-player, and,\r\nwhen travelling alone, he used to carry a book with diagrams of\r\npartially-played games, in which it is required to give checkmate in a\r\nfixed number of moves. He would study one of them, and then, shutting\r\nthe book, play out the game mentally.\r\n\r\nAlthough Sir John was a keen sportsman and ox-hunter in his youth, he\r\nwas remarkable for his kindness to animals and for the facility with\r\nwhich he tamed them. He kept terriers, and his pointers were first rate,\r\nyet he never allowed his keepers to beat a dog, nor did he ever do it\r\nhimself; he said a dog once cowed was good for nothing ever after. He\r\ntrained them by tying a string to the collar and giving it a sharp pull\r\nwhen the dog did wrong, and patting him kindly when he did right. In\r\nthis manner he taught some of his non-sporting dogs to play all sorts of\r\ntricks, such as picking out the card chosen by any spectator from a\r\nnumber placed in a circle on the floor, the signal being one momentary\r\nglance at the card, &c. &c. Sir John published a pamphlet on the\r\nsubject, and sent copies of it to the sporting gentlemen and keepers in\r\nthe county, I fear with little effect; men are so apt to vent their own\r\nbad temper on their dogs and horses.\r\n\r\nAt one of the battues at Holkham, Chantrey killed two woodcocks at one\r\nshot. Mr. Hudson Gurney some time after saw a brace of woodcocks carved\r\nin marble in Chantrey's studio; Chantrey told him of his shot and the\r\ndifficulty of finding a suitable inscription, and that it had been tried\r\nin Latin and even Greek without success. Mr. Gurney said it should be\r\nvery simple, such as:--\r\n\r\n    Driven from the north, where winter starved them,\r\n    Chantrey first shot, and then he carved them.\r\n\r\nBeechwood was one of the few places in Great Britain in which hawking\r\nwas kept up. The falcons were brought from Flanders, for, except in the\r\nIsle of Skye, they have been extirpated in Great Britain like many other\r\nof our fine indigenous birds. Sir John kept fancy pigeons of all\r\nbreeds. He told me he could alter the colour of their plumage in three\r\nyears by cross-breeding, but that it required fully six to alter the\r\nshape of the bird.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt some house where we were dining in London, I forget with whom, Ugo\r\nFoscolo, the poet, was one of the party. He was extremely excitable and\r\nirritable, and when some one spoke of a translation of Dante as being\r\nperfect, \"Impossible,\" shouted Foscolo, starting up in great excitement,\r\nat the same time tossing his cup full of coffee into the air, cup and\r\nall, regardless of the china and the ladies' dresses. He died in\r\nEngland, I fear in great poverty. He was a most distinguished classical\r\nscholar as well as poet. His remains have been brought to Italy within\r\nthese few years, and interred in Sante Croce, in Florence.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI had a severe attack of what appeared to be cholera, and during my\r\nrecovery Mrs. Hankey very kindly lent us her villa at Hampstead for a\r\nfew weeks. There I went with my children, Somerville with some friends\r\nalways coming to dinner on the Sundays. On one of these occasions there\r\nwas a violent thunderstorm, and a large tree was struck not far from the\r\nhouse. We all went to look at the tree as soon as the storm ceased, and\r\nfound that a large mass of wood was scooped out of the trunk from top to\r\nbottom. I had occasion in two other instances to notice the same effect.\r\nDr. Wollaston lent me a sextant and artificial horizon; so I amused\r\nmyself taking the altitude of the sun, the consequence of which was that\r\nI became as brown as a mulatto, but I was too anxious to learn something\r\nof practical astronomy to care about the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF MARGARET SOMERVILLE--LETTER FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO THE REV.\r\nDR. SOMERVILLE--LIFE AT CHELSEA--THE NAPIERS--MARIA EDGEWORTH--TOUR IN\r\nGERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur happy and cheerful life in Hanover Square came to a sad end. The\r\nillness and death of our eldest girl threw Somerville and me into the\r\ndeepest affliction. She was a child of intelligence and acquirements far\r\nbeyond her tender age.\r\n\r\n    [The long illness and death of this young girl fell very heavily on\r\n    my mother, who by this time had lost several children. The following\r\n    letter was written by her to my grandfather on this occasion. It\r\n    shows her steadfast faith in the mercy and goodness of God, even\r\n    when crushed by almost the severest affliction which can wring a\r\n    mother's heart:--]\r\n\r\n    MRS. SOMERVILLE TO THE REV. DR. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    LONDON, _October_, 1823.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n    I never was so long of writing to you, but when the heart is\r\n    breaking it is impossible to find words adequate to its relief. We\r\n    are in deep affliction, for though the first violence of grief has\r\n    subsided, there has succeeded a calm sorrow not less painful, a\r\n    feeling of hopelessness in this world which only finds comfort in\r\n    the prospect of another, which longs for the consummation of all\r\n    things that we may join those who have gone before. To return to the\r\n    duties of life is irksome, even to those duties which were a delight\r\n    when the candle of the Lord shone upon us. I do not arraign the\r\n    decrees of Providence, but even in the bitterness of my soul I\r\n    acknowledge the wisdom and goodness of God, and endeavour to be\r\n    resigned to His will. It is ungrateful not to remember the many\r\n    happy years we have enjoyed, but that very remembrance renders our\r\n    present state more desolate and dreary--presenting a sad contrast.\r\n    The great source of consolation is in the mercy of God and the\r\n    virtues of those we lament; the full assurance that no good\r\n    disposition can be lost but must be brought to perfection in a\r\n    better world. Our business is to render ourselves fit for that\r\n    blessed inheritance that we may again be united to those we mourn.\r\n\r\n                   Your affectionate daughter,\r\n                                          MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSomerville still held his place at the army medical board, and was now\r\nappointed physician to Chelsea Hospital; so we left our cheerful,\r\ncomfortable house and went to reside in a government house in a very\r\ndreary and unhealthy situation, far from all our friends, which was a\r\nserious loss to me, as I was not a good walker, and during the whole\r\ntime I lived at Chelsea I suffered from sick headaches. Still we were\r\nvery glad of the appointment, for at this time we lost almost the whole\r\nof our fortune, through the dishonesty of a person in whom we had the\r\ngreatest confidence.\r\n\r\nAll the time we lived at Chelsea we had constant intercourse with Lady\r\nNoel Byron and Ada, who lived at Esher, and when I came abroad I kept up\r\na correspondence with both as long as they lived. Ada was much attached\r\nto me, and often came to stay with me. It was by my advice that she\r\nstudied mathematics. She always wrote to me for an explanation when she\r\nmet with any difficulty. Among my papers I lately found many of her\r\nnotes, asking mathematical questions. Ada Byron married Lord King,\r\nafterwards created Earl of Lovelace, a college companion and friend of\r\nmy son.\r\n\r\nSomerville had formed a friendship with Sir Henry Bunbury when he had a\r\ncommand in Sicily, and we went occasionally to visit him at Barton in\r\nSuffolk. I liked Lady Bunbury very much; she was a niece of the\r\ncelebrated Charles Fox, and had a turn for natural history. I had made a\r\ncollection of native shells at Burntisland, but I only knew their vulgar\r\nnames; now I learnt their scientific arrangement from Lady Bunbury. Her\r\nson, Sir Charles Bunbury, is an authority for fossil botany. The first\r\nPinetum I ever saw was at Barton, and in 1837 I planted a cedar in\r\nremembrance of one of our visits.\r\n\r\nThrough Lady Bunbury we became intimate with all the members of the\r\nillustrious family of the Napiers, as she was sister of Colonel,\r\nafterwards General Sir William Napier, author of the \"History of the\r\nPeninsular War.\" One day Colonel Napier, who was then living in Sloane\r\nStreet, introduced Somerville and me to his mother, Lady Sarah Napier.\r\nHer manners were distinguished, and though totally blind, she still had\r\nthe remains of great beauty; her hand and arm, which were exposed by the\r\nancient costume she wore, were most beautiful still. The most sincere\r\nfriendship existed between Richard Napier and his wife and me through\r\nlife; I shall never forget their kindness to me at a time when I was in\r\ngreat sorrow. All the brothers are now gone. Richard and his wife were\r\nlong in bad health, and he was nearly blind; but his wife never knew it,\r\nthrough the devoted attachment of Emily Shirriff, daughter of Admiral\r\nShirriff, who was the comfort and consolation of both to their dying\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMaria Edgeworth came frequently to see us when she was in England. She\r\nwas one of my most intimate friends, warm-hearted and kind, a charming\r\ncompanion, with all the liveliness and originality of an Irishwoman.\r\nFor seventeen years I was in constant correspondence with her. The\r\ncleverness and animation as well as affection of her letters I cannot\r\nexpress; certainly women are superior to men in letter-writing.\r\n\r\n    [The following is an extract from a letter from Maria Edgeworth to a\r\n    friend concerning my mother:--]\r\n\r\n    MARIA EDGEWORTH TO MISS .....\r\n\r\n    BEECHWOOD PARK, _January 17th, 1822_.\r\n\r\n    We have spent two days pleasantly here with Dr. Wollaston, our own\r\n    dear friend Mrs. Marcet, and the Somervilles. Mrs. Somerville is the\r\n    lady who, Laplace says, is the only woman who understands his works.\r\n    She draws beautifully, and while her head is among the stars her\r\n    feet are firm upon the earth.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Somerville is little, slightly made, fairish hair, pink colour,\r\n    small, grey, round, intelligent, smiling eyes, very pleasing\r\n    countenance, remarkably soft voice, strong, but well-bred Scotch\r\n    accent; timid, not disqualifying timid, but naturally modest, yet\r\n    with a degree of self-possession through it which prevents her being\r\n    in the least awkward, and gives her all the advantage of her\r\n    understanding, at the same time that it adds a prepossessing charm\r\n    to her manner and takes off all dread of her superior scientific\r\n    learning.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhile in London I had a French maid for my daughters, and on coming to\r\nChelsea I taught them a little geometry and algebra, as well as Latin\r\nand Greek, and, later, got a master for them, that they might have a\r\nmore perfect knowledge of these languages than I possessed. Keenly alive\r\nto my own defects, I was anxious that my children should never undergo\r\nthe embarrassment and mortification I had suffered from ignorance of the\r\ncommon European languages. I engaged a young German lady, daughter of\r\nProfessor Becker, of Offenbach, near Frankfort, as governess, and was\r\nmost happy in my choice; but after being with us for a couple of years,\r\nshe had a very bad attack of fever, and was obliged to return home. She\r\nwas replaced by a younger sister, who afterwards married Professor\r\nTrendelenburg, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Berlin.\r\nThough both these sisters were quite young, I had the most perfect\r\nconfidence in them, from their strict conscientiousness and morality.\r\nThey were well educated, ladylike, and so amiable, that they gained the\r\nfriendship of my children and the affection of us all.\r\n\r\nAs we could with perfect confidence leave the children to Miss Becker's\r\ncare, Sir James Mackintosh, Somerville and I made an excursion to the\r\nContinent. We went to Brussels, and what lady can go there without\r\nseeing the lace manufactory? I saw, admired,--and bought none! We were\r\nkindly received by Professor Quetelet, whom we had previously known,\r\nand who never failed to send me a copy of his valuable memoirs as soon\r\nas they were published. I have uniformly met with the greatest kindness\r\nfrom scientific men at home and abroad. If any of them are alive when\r\nthis record is published, I beg they will accept of my gratitude. Of\r\nthose that are no more I bear a grateful remembrance.\r\n\r\nThe weather was beautiful when we were at Brussels, and in the evening\r\nwe went to the public garden. It was crowded with people, and very gay.\r\nWe sat down, and amused ourselves by looking at them as they passed. Sir\r\nJames was a most agreeable companion, intimate with all the political\r\ncharacters of the day, full of anecdote and historical knowledge. That\r\nevening his conversation was so brilliant that we forgot the time, and\r\nlooking around found that everybody had left the garden, so we thought\r\nwe might as well return to the hotel; but on coming to the iron-barred\r\ngate we found it locked. Sir James and Somerville begged some of those\r\nthat were passing to call the keeper of the park to let us out; but they\r\nsaid it was impossible, that we must wait till morning. A crowd\r\nassembled laughing and mocking, till at last we got out through the\r\nhouse of one of the keepers of the park.\r\n\r\nAt Bonn we met with Baron Humboldt, and M. Schlegel, celebrated for his\r\ntranslation of Shakespeare. On going up the Rhine, Sir James knew the\r\nhistory of every place and of every battle that had been fought. A\r\nprofessor of his acquaintance in one of the towns invited us to dinner,\r\nand I was astonished to see the lady of the house going about with a\r\ngreat bunch of keys dangling at her side, assisting in serving up the\r\ndinner, and doing all the duty of carving, her husband taking no part\r\nwhatever in it. I was annoyed that we had given so much trouble by\r\naccepting the invitation. In my younger days in Scotland, a lady might\r\nmake the pastry and jelly, or direct in the kitchen; but she took no\r\npart in cooking or serving up the dinner, and never rose from the table\r\ntill the ladies went to the drawing-room. However, as we could not\r\nafford to keep a regular cook, an ill-dressed dish would occasionally\r\nappear, and then my father would say, \"God sends food, but the devil\r\nsends cooks.\"\r\n\r\nIn our tour through Holland, Somerville was quite at home, and amused\r\nhimself talking to the people, for he had learnt the Dutch language at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. We admired the pretty quaint costumes of the\r\nwomen; but I was the only one who took interest in the galleries. Many\r\nof the pictures of the Dutch school are very fine; but I never should\r\nhave made a collection exclusively of them as was often done at one time\r\nin England. Lord Granville was British Minister at the Hague, and dining\r\nat the Embassy one day we met with a Mrs.----, who, on hearing one of\r\nthe attachés addressed as Mr. Abercromby,[9] said, \"Pray, Lord\r\nGranville, is that a son of the great captain whom the Lord slew in the\r\nland of Egypt?'\"\r\n\r\nI never met with Madame de Staël, but heard a great deal about her\r\nduring this journey from Sir James Mackintosh, who was very intimate\r\nwith her. At that time the men sat longer at table after dinner than\r\nthey do now; and on one occasion, at a dinner party at Sir James's\r\nhouse, when Lady Mackintosh and the ladies returned to the drawing-room,\r\nMadame de Staël, who was exceedingly impatient of women's society, would\r\nnot deign to enter into conversation with any of the ladies, but walked\r\nabout the room; then suddenly ringing the bell, she said, \"Ceci est\r\ninsupportable!\" and when the servant appeared, she said: \"Tell your\r\nmaster to come upstairs directly; they have sat long enough at their\r\nwine.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Afterwards Sir Ralph Abercromby, later Lord Dunfermline,\r\nminister first at Florence, then at Turin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM LORD BROUGHAM--WRITES \"MECHANISM OF THE HEAVENS\"--ANECDOTE\r\nOF THE ROMAN IMPROVISATRICE--LETTERS FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL AND\r\nPROFESSOR WHEWELL--ELECTED HON.

It is dated March 27th, 1827:--]\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM LORD BROUGHAM TO DR. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n    I fear you will think me very daring for the design I have formed\r\n    against Mrs. Somerville, and still more for making you my advocate\r\n    with her; through whom I have every hope of prevailing. There will\r\n    be sent to you a prospectus, rules, and a preliminary treatise of\r\n    our Society for Diffusing Useful Knowledge, and I assure you I speak\r\n    without any flattery when I say that of the two subjects which I\r\n    find it most difficult to see the chance of executing, there is\r\n    one, which--unless Mrs. Somerville will undertake--none else can,\r\n    and it must be left undone, though about the most interesting of the\r\n    whole, I mean an account of the Mécanique Céleste; the other is an\r\n    account of the Principia, which I have some hopes of at Cambridge.\r\n    The kind of thing wanted is such a description of that divine work\r\n    as will both explain to the unlearned the sort of thing it is--the\r\n    plan, the vast merit, the wonderful truths unfolded or\r\n    methodized--and the calculus by which all this is accomplished, and\r\n    will also give a somewhat deeper insight to the uninitiated. Two\r\n    treatises would do this. No one without trying it can conceive how\r\n    far we may carry ignorant readers into an understanding of the\r\n    depths of science, and our treatises have about 100 to 800 pages of\r\n    space each, so that one might give the more popular view, and\r\n    another the analytical abstracts and illustrations. In England there\r\n    are now not twenty people who know this great work, except by name;\r\n    and not a hundred who know it even by name. My firm belief is that\r\n    Mrs. Somerville could add two cyphers to each of those figures. Will\r\n    you be my counsel in this suit? Of course our names are concealed,\r\n    and no one of our council but myself needs to know it.\r\n\r\n                                         Yours ever most truly,\r\n                                                          H. BROUGHAM.\r\n\r\n    My mother in alluding to the above says:--\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThis letter surprised me beyond expression. I thought Lord Brougham must\r\nhave been mistaken with regard to my acquirements, and naturally\r\nconcluded that my self-acquired knowledge was so far inferior to that\r\nof the men who had been educated in our universities that it would be\r\nthe height of presumption to attempt to write on such a subject or\r\nindeed on any other. A few days after this Lord Brougham came to Chelsea\r\nhimself, and Somerville joined with him in urging me at least to make\r\nthe attempt. I said, \"Lord Brougham, you must be aware that the work in\r\nquestion never can be popularized, since the student must at least know\r\nsomething of the differential and integral calculi, and as a preliminary\r\nstep I should have to prove various problems in physical mechanics and\r\nastronomy. Besides, La Place never gives diagrams or figures, because\r\nthey are not necessary to persons versed in the calculus, but they would\r\nbe indispensable in a work such as you wish me to write. I am afraid I\r\nam incapable of such a task: but as you both wish it so much, I shall do\r\nmy very best upon condition of secrecy, and that if I fail the\r\nmanuscript shall be put into the fire.\" Thus suddenly and unexpectedly\r\nthe whole character and course of my future life was changed.\r\n\r\nI rose early and made such arrangements with regard to my children and\r\nfamily affairs that I had time to write afterwards; not, however,\r\nwithout many interruptions. A man can always command his time under the\r\nplea of business, a woman is not allowed any such excuse. At Chelsea I\r\nwas always supposed to be at home, and as my friends and acquaintances\r\ncame so far out of their way on purpose to see me, it would have been\r\nunkind and ungenerous not to receive them. Nevertheless, I was sometimes\r\nannoyed when in the midst of a difficult problem some one would enter\r\nand say, \"I have come to spend a few hours with you.\" However, I learnt\r\nby habit to leave a subject and resume it again at once, like putting a\r\nmark into a book I might be reading; this was the more necessary as\r\nthere was no fire-place in my little room, and I had to write in the\r\ndrawing-room in winter. Frequently I hid my papers as soon as the bell\r\nannounced a visitor, lest anyone should discover my secret.\r\n\r\n    [My mother had a singular power of abstraction. When occupied with\r\n    some difficult problem, or even a train of thought which deeply\r\n    interested her, she lost all consciousness of what went on around\r\n    her, and became so entirely absorbed that any amount of talking, or\r\n    even practising scales and _solfeggi_, went on without in the least\r\n    disturbing her. Sometimes a song or a strain of melody would recall\r\n    her to a sense of the present, for she was passionately fond of\r\n    music. A curious instance of this peculiarity of hers occurred at\r\n    Rome, when a large party were assembled to listen to a celebrated\r\n    improvisatrice. My mother was placed in the front row, close to the\r\n    poetess, who, for several stanzas, adhered strictly to the subject\r\n    which had been given to her. What it was I do not recollect, except\r\n    that it had no connection with what followed. All at once, as if by\r\n    a sudden inspiration, the lady turned her eyes full upon my mother,\r\n    and with true Italian vehemence and in the full musical accents of\r\n    Rome, poured forth stanza after stanza of the most eloquent\r\n    panegyric upon her talents and virtues, extolling them and her to\r\n    the skies. Throughout the whole of this scene, which lasted a\r\n    considerable time, my mother remained calm and unmoved, never\r\n    changing countenance, which surprised not only the persons present\r\n    but ourselves, as we well knew how much she disliked any display or\r\n    being brought forward in public. The truth was, that after listening\r\n    for a while to the improvising, a thought struck her connected with\r\n    some subject she was engaged in writing upon at the time and so\r\n    entirely absorbed her that she heard not a word of all that had been\r\n    declaimed in her praise, and was not a little surprised and confused\r\n    when she was complimented on it. I call this, advisedly, a power of\r\n    hers, for although it occasionally led her into strange positions,\r\n    such as the one above mentioned, it rendered her entirely\r\n    independent of outward circumstances, nor did she require to isolate\r\n    herself from the family circle in order to pursue her studies. I\r\n    have already mentioned that when we were very young she taught us\r\n    herself for a few hours daily; when our lessons were over we always\r\n    remained in the room with her, learning grammar, arithmetic, or some\r\n    such plague of childhood. Any one who has plunged into the mazes of\r\n    the higher branches of mathematics or other abstruse science, would\r\n    probably feel no slight degree of irritation on being interrupted\r\n    at a critical moment when the solution was almost within his grasp,\r\n    by some childish question about tense or gender, or how much seven\r\n    times seven made. My mother was never impatient, but explained our\r\n    little difficulties quickly and kindly, and returned calmly to her\r\n    own profound thoughts. Yet on occasion she could show both\r\n    irritation and impatience--when we were stupid or inattentive,\r\n    neither of which she could stand. With her clear mind she darted at\r\n    the solution, sometimes forgetting that we had to toil after her\r\n    laboriously step by step. I well remember her slender white hand\r\n    pointing impatiently to the book or slate--\"Don't you see it? there\r\n    is no difficulty in it, it is quite clear.\" Things were so clear to\r\n    her! I must here add some other recollections by my mother of this\r\n    very interesting portion of her life.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI was a considerable time employed in writing this book, but I by no\r\nmeans gave up society, which would neither have suited Somerville nor\r\nme. We dined out, went to evening parties, and occasionally to the\r\ntheatre. As soon as my work was finished I sent the manuscript to Lord\r\nBrougham, requesting that it might be thoroughly examined, criticised\r\nand destroyed according to promise if a failure. I was very nervous\r\nwhile it was under examination, and was equally surprised and gratified\r\nthat Sir John Herschel, our greatest astronomer, and perfectly versed in\r\nthe calculus, should have found so few errors. The letter he wrote on\r\nthis occasion made me so happy and proud that I have preserved it.\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I have read your manuscript with the greatest pleasure, and will not\r\n    hesitate to add, (because I am sure you will believe it sincere,)\r\n    with the highest admiration. Go on thus, and you will leave a\r\n    memorial of no common kind to posterity; and, what you will value\r\n    far more than fame, you will have accomplished a most useful work.\r\n    What a pity that La Place has not lived to see this illustration of\r\n    his great work! You will only, I fear, give too strong a stimulus to\r\n    the study of abstract science by this performance.\r\n\r\n    I have marked as somewhat obscure a part of the illustration of the\r\n    principle of virtual velocities.... Will you look at this point\r\n    again? I have made a trifling remark in page 6, but it is a mere\r\n    matter of metaphysical nicety, and perhaps hardly worth pencilling\r\n    your beautiful manuscript for.\r\n\r\n                                      Ever yours most truly,\r\n                                                       J. HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n    [In publishing the following letter, I do not consider that I am\r\n    infringing on the rule I have followed in obedience to my mother's\r\n    wishes, that is, to abstain from giving publicity to all letters\r\n    which are of a private and confidential character. This one entirely\r\n    concerns her scientific writings, and is interesting as showing the\r\n    confidence which existed between Sir John Herschel and\r\n    herself. This great philosopher was my mother's truest and best\r\n    friend, one whose opinion she valued above all others, whose genius\r\n    and consummate talents she admired, and whose beautiful character\r\n    she loved with an intensity which is better shown by some extracts\r\n    from her letters to be given presently than by anything I can say.\r\n    This deep regard on her part he returned with the most chivalrous\r\n    respect and admiration. In any doubt or difficulty it was his advice\r\n    she sought, his criticism she submitted to; both were always frankly\r\n    given without the slightest fear of giving offence, for Sir John\r\n    Herschel well knew the spirit with which any remarks of his would be\r\n    received.]\r\n\r\n    FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    SLOUGH, _Feb. 23rd, 1830_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    ... As you contemplate separate publication, and as the attention of\r\n    many will be turned to a work from _your_ pen who will just possess\r\n    quantum enough of mathematical knowledge to be able to read the\r\n    first chapter without being able to follow you into its application,\r\n    and as these, moreover, are the very people who will think\r\n    themselves privileged to criticise and use their privilege with the\r\n    least discretion, I cannot recommend too much clearness, fulness,\r\n    and order in the _exposé_ of the principles. Were I you, I would\r\n    devote to this first part at least double the space you have done.\r\n    Your familiarity with the results and formulæ has led you into what\r\n    is extremely natural in such a case--a somewhat hasty passing over\r\n    what, to a beginner, would prove insuperable difficulties; and if I\r\n    may so express it, a sketchiness of outline (as a painter you will\r\n    understand my meaning, and what is of more consequence, see how it\r\n    is to be remedied).\r\n\r\n    You have adopted, I see, the principle of virtual velocity, and the\r\n    principle of d'Alembert, rather as separate and independent\r\n    principles to be used as instruments of investigation than as\r\n    convenient theories, flowing themselves from the general law of\r\n    force and equilibrium, to be first _proved_ and then remembered as\r\n    compact statements in a form fit for use. The demonstration of the\r\n    principle of virtual velocities is so easy and direct in Laplace\r\n    that I cannot imagine anything capable of rendering it plainer than\r\n    he has done. But a good deal more explanation of what _is_ virtual\r\n    velocity, &c., would be advantageous--and virtual velocities should\r\n    be kept quite distinct from the arbitrary variations represented by\r\n    the sign [Greek: d].\r\n\r\n    With regard to the _principle of d'Alembert_--take my advice and\r\n    explode it altogether. It is the most awkward and involved statement\r\n    of a plain dynamical equation that ever puzzled student. I speak\r\n    feelingly and with a sense of irritation at the whirls and vortices\r\n    it used to cause in my poor head when first I entered on this\r\n    subject in my days of studentship. I know not a single case where\r\n    its application does not create obscurity--nay _doubt_. Nor can a\r\n    case ever occur where any such principle is called for. The general\r\n    law that the change of motion is proportional to the moving force\r\n    and takes place in its direction, provided we take care always to\r\n    regard the _reaction_ of curves, surfaces, obstacles, &c., as so\r\n    many real moving forces of (for a time) unknown magnitude, will\r\n    always help us out of any dynamical scrape we may get into. Laplace,\r\n    page 20, Méc. Cél. art. 7, is a little obscure here, and in deriving\r\n    his equation (_f_) a page of explanation would be well bestowed.\r\n\r\n    One thing let me recommend, if you use as principles either this, or\r\n    that of virtual velocities, or any other, state them broadly and in\r\n    general terms.... You will think me, I fear, a rough critic, but I\r\n    think of Horace's _good critic_,\r\n\r\n        Fiet Aristarchus: nec dicet, cur ego amicum\r\n        Offendam in nugis? Hæ nugæ seria ducent\r\n        In mala,\r\n\r\n    and what we can both now laugh at, and you may, if you like, burn as\r\n    nonsense (I mean these remarks), would come with a very different\r\n    kind of force from some sneering reviewer in the plenitude of his\r\n    triumph at the detection of a slip of the pen or one of those little\r\n    inaccuracies which _humana parum cavit natura_....\r\n\r\n                                    Very faithfully yours,\r\n                                                      J. HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [About the same time my father received a letter from Dr. Whewell,\r\n    afterwards Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, dated 2nd November,\r\n    1831, in which he says:--]\r\n\r\n    \"I beg you to offer my best thanks to Mrs. Somerville for her kind\r\n    present. I shall have peculiar satisfaction in possessing it as a\r\n    gift of the author, a book which I look upon as one of the most\r\n    remarkable which our age has produced, which would be highly\r\n    valuable from anyone, and which derives a peculiar interest from its\r\n    writer. I am charged also to return the thanks of the Philosophical\r\n    Society here for the copy presented to them. I have not thought it\r\n    necessary to send the official letter containing the acknowledgment,\r\n    as Mrs. Somerville will probably have a sufficient collection of\r\n    specimens of such character. I have also to thank her on the part of\r\n    our College for the copy sent to the library. I am glad that our\r\n    young mathematicians in Trinity will have easy access to the book,\r\n    which will be very good for them as soon as they can read it. When\r\n    Mrs. Somerville shows herself in the field which we mathematicians\r\n    have been labouring in all our lives, and puts us to shame, she\r\n    ought not to be surprised if we move off to other ground, and betake\r\n    ourselves to poetry. If the fashion of 'commendatory verses' were\r\n    not gone by, I have no doubt her work might have appeared with a\r\n    very pretty collection of well-deserved poetical praises in its\r\n    introductory pages. As old customs linger longest in places like\r\n    this, I hope she and you will not think it quite extravagant to send\r\n    a single sonnet on the occasion.\r\n\r\n                                             \"Believe me,\r\n                                                  \"Faithfully yours,\r\n                                                           \"W.

SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    ON HER \"MECHANISM OF THE HEAVENS.\"\r\n\r\n    Lady, it was the wont in earlier days\r\n    When some fair volume from a valued pen,\r\n    Long looked for, came at last, that grateful men\r\n    Hailed its forthcoming in complacent lays:\r\n    As if the Muse would gladly haste to praise\r\n    That which her mother, Memory, long should keep\r\n    Among her treasures. Shall such usage sleep\r\n    With us, who feel too slight the common phrase\r\n    For our pleased thoughts of you, when thus we find\r\n    That dark to you seems bright, perplexed seems plain,\r\n    Seen in the depths of a pellucid mind,\r\n    Full of clear thought, pure from the ill and vain\r\n    That cloud the inward light? An honoured name\r\n    Be yours; and peace of heart grow with your growing fame.\r\n\r\n    [Professor Peacock, afterwards Dean of Ely, in a letter, dated\r\n    February 14th, 1832, thanked my mother for a copy of the \"Mechanism\r\n    of the Heavens.\"]\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PEACOCK TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    \"I consider it to be a work which will contribute greatly to the\r\n    extension of the knowledge of physical astronomy, in this country,\r\n    and of the great analytical processes which have been employed in\r\n    such investigations. It is with this view that I consider it to be a\r\n    work of the greatest value and importance. Dr. Whewell and myself\r\n    have already taken steps to introduce it into the course of our\r\n    studies at Cambridge, and I have little doubt that it will\r\n    immediately become an essential work to those of our students who\r\n    aspire to the highest places in our examinations.\"\r\n\r\n    [On this my mother remarks:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI consider this as the highest honour I ever received, at the time I was\r\nno less sensible of it, and was most grateful. I was surprised and\r\npleased beyond measure to find that my book should be so much approved\r\nof by Dr. Whewell, one of the most eminent men of the age for science\r\nand literature; and by Professor Peacock, a profound mathematician, who\r\nwith Herschel and Babbage had, a few years before, first introduced the\r\ncalculus as an essential branch of science into the University of\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this decision the whole edition of the \"Mechanism of\r\nthe Heavens,\" amounting to 750 copies, was sold chiefly at Cambridge,\r\nwith the exception of a very few which I gave to friends; but as the\r\npreface was the only part of the work that was intelligible to the\r\ngeneral reader, I had some copies of it printed separately to give away.\r\n\r\nI was astonished at the success of my book; all the reviews of it were\r\nhighly favourable; I received letters of congratulation from many men of\r\nscience. I was elected an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical\r\nSociety at the same time as Miss Caroline Herschel. To be associated\r\nwith so distinguished an astronomer was in itself an honour. Mr. De\r\nMorgan, to whom I am indebted for many excellent mathematical works, was\r\nthen secretary of the society, and announced to us the distinction\r\nconferred. The council of the Society ordered that a copy of the\r\n\"Greenwich Observations\" should be regularly sent to me.\r\n\r\n    [The _Académie des Sciences_ elected my mother's old friend M. Biot\r\n    to draw up a report upon her \"Mechanism of the Heavens,\" which he\r\n    did in the most flattering terms, and upon my mother writing to\r\n    thank him, replied as follows:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM M. BIOT TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    MADAME,\r\n\r\n    Revenu de Lyon depuis quelques jours, j'ai trouvé à Paris les deux\r\n    lettres dont vous avez daigné m'honorer, et j'ai reçu également\r\n    l'exemplaire de votre ouvrage que vous avez bien voulu joindre à la\r\n    dernière. C'est être mille fois trop bonne, Madame, que de me\r\n    remercier encore de ce qui m'a fait tant de plaisir. En rendant\r\n    compte de cet étonnant Traité, je remplissais d'abord un devoir,\r\n    puisque l'Académie m'avait chargé de le lire pour elle; mais ce\r\n    devoir m'offrait un attrait que vous concevriez facilement, s'il\r\n    vous était possible de vous rappeler l'admiration vive et profonde\r\n    que m'inspira il y a longtemps l'union si extraordinaire de tous les\r\n    talens et de toutes les grâces, avec les connaissances sevères que\r\n    nous autres hommes avions la folie de croire notre partage exclusif.\r\n    Ce qui me charma alors, Madame, je n'ai pas cessé depuis de m'en\r\n    souvenir; et des rapports d'amitié qui me sont bien chers, ont\r\n    encore, à votre insçu, fortifié ces sentimens. Jugez donc, Madame,\r\n    combien j'étais heureux d'avoir à peindre ce que je comprenais si\r\n    bien, et ce que j'avais vu avec un si vif intérêt. Le plus amusant\r\n    pour moi de cette rencontre, c'était de voir nos plus graves\r\n    confrères, par exemple, Lacroix et Legendre, qui certes ne sont pas\r\n    des esprits légers, ni galans d'habitude, ni faciles à émouvoir, me\r\n    gourmander, comme ils le faisaient à chaque séance, de ce que je\r\n    tardais tant à faire mon rapport, de ce que j'y mettais tant\r\n    d'insouciance et si peu de grâce; enfin, Madame, c'était une\r\n    conquête intellectuelle complète. Je n'ai pas manqué de raconter\r\n    cette circonstance comme un des fleurons de votre couronne. Je me\r\n    suis ainsi acquitté envers eux; et quant à vous, Madame, d'après la\r\n    manière dont vous parlez vous-même de votre ouvrage, j'ai quelque\r\n    espérance de l'avoir présenté sous le point de vue où vous semblez\r\n    l'envisager. Mais, en vous rendant ce juste et sincère hommage et en\r\n    l'insérant au Journal des Savants, je n'ai pas eu la précaution de\r\n    demander qu'on m'en mit à part; aujourd'hui que la collection est\r\n    tirée je suis aux regrets d'avoir été si peu prévoyant. Au reste,\r\n    Madame, il n'y a rien dans cet extrait que ce que pensent tous ceux\r\n    qui vous connaissent, ou même qui ont eu une seule fois le bonheur\r\n    de vous approcher. Vos amis trouveront que j'ai exprimé bien\r\n    faiblement les charmes de votre esprit et de votre caractère;\r\n    charmes qu'ils doivent apprécier d'autant mieux qu'ils en jouissent\r\n    plus souvent; mais vous, Madame, qui êtes indulgente, vous\r\n    pardonnerez la faiblesse d'un portrait qui n'a pu être fait que de\r\n    souvenir.\r\n\r\n    J'ai l'honneur d'être, avec le plus profond respect,\r\n\r\n                                    Madame,\r\n                    Votre très humble et très obéissant serviteur,\r\n                                                                 BIOT.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt was unanimously voted by the Royal Society of London, that my bust\r\nshould be placed in their great Hall, and Chantrey was chosen as the\r\nsculptor. Soon after it was finished, Mr. Potter, a great ship-builder\r\nat Liverpool, who had just completed a fine vessel intended for the\r\nChina and India trade, wrote to my friend, Sir Francis Beaufort,\r\nhydrographer of the Royal Navy, asking him if I would give him\r\npermission to call her the \"Mary Somerville,\" and to have a copy of my\r\nbust for her figure-head. I was much gratified with this, as might be\r\nexpected. The \"Mary Somerville\" sailed, but was never heard of again; it\r\nwas supposed she had foundered during a typhoon in the China sea.\r\n\r\nI was elected an honorary member of the Royal Academy at Dublin, of the\r\nBristol Philosophical Institution, and of the Société de Physique et\r\nd'Histoire Naturelle of Geneva, which was announced to me by a very\r\ngratifying letter from Professor Prevost.\r\n\r\nOur relations and others who had so severely criticized and ridiculed\r\nme, astonished at my success, were now loud in my praise. The warmth\r\nwith which Somerville entered into my success deeply affected me; for\r\nnot one in ten thousand would have rejoiced at it as he did; but he was\r\nof a generous nature, far above jealousy, and he continued through life\r\nto take the kindest interest in all I did.\r\n\r\nI now received the following letter from Sir Robert Peel, informing me\r\nin the handsomest manner that he had advised the King to grant me a\r\npension of 200_l._ a year:--\r\n\r\n    LETTER FROM SIR ROBERT PEEL TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    WHITEHALL GARDENS\r\n    _March, 1835_.\r\n\r\n    MADAM,\r\n\r\n    In advising the Crown in respect to the grant of civil pensions, I\r\n    have acted equally with a sense of public duty and on the impulse of\r\n    my own private feelings in recognising among the first claims on the\r\n    Royal favour those which are derived from eminence in science and\r\n    literature.\r\n\r\n    In reviewing such claims, it is impossible that I can overlook those\r\n    which you have established by the successful prosecution of studies\r\n    of the highest order, both from the importance of the objects to\r\n    which they relate, and from the faculties and acquirements which\r\n    they demand.\r\n\r\n    As my object is a public one, to encourage others to follow the\r\n    bright example which you have set, and to prove that great\r\n    scientific attainments are recognised among public claims, I prefer\r\n    making a direct communication to you, to any private inquiries into\r\n    your pecuniary circumstances, or to any proposal through a third\r\n    party. I am enabled to advise His Majesty to grant to you a pension\r\n    on the civil list of two hundred pounds per annum; and if that\r\n    provision will enable you to pursue your labours with less of\r\n    anxiety, either as to the present or the future, I shall only be\r\n    fulfilling a public duty, and not imposing upon you the slightest\r\n    obligation, by availing myself of your permission to submit such a\r\n    recommendation to the King.\r\n\r\n                      I have the honour to be,\r\n                              Madam, with the sincerest respect,\r\n                                                         ROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI was highly pleased, but my pleasure was of short duration, for the\r\nvery next day a letter informed us that by the treachery of persons in\r\nwhom we trusted, the last remains of our capital were lost. By the\r\nkindness of Lord John Russell, when he was Prime Minister, a hundred\r\na-year was added to my pension, for which I was very grateful.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAfter the \"Mechanism of the Heavens\" was published, I was thrown out of\r\nwork, and now that I had got into the habit of writing I did not know\r\nwhat to make of my spare time. Fortunately the preface of my book\r\nfurnished me with the means of active occupation; for in it I saw such\r\nmutual dependence and connection in many branches of science, that I\r\nthought the subject might be carried to a greater extent.\r\n\r\nThere were many subjects with which I was only partially acquainted, and\r\nothers of which I had no previous knowledge, but which required to be\r\ncarefully investigated, so I had to consult a variety of authors,\r\nBritish and foreign. Even the astronomical part was difficult, for I had\r\nto translate analytical formulæ into intelligible language, and to draw\r\ndiagrams illustrative thereof, and this occupied the first seven\r\nsections of the book. I should have been saved much trouble had I seen a\r\nwork on the subject by Mr. Airy, Astronomer-Royal, published\r\nsubsequently to my book.\r\n\r\nMy son, Woronzow Greig, had been educated at Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nand was travelling on the Continent, when Somerville and I received an\r\ninvitation from the Principal, Dr. Whewell, to visit the University. Mr.\r\nAiry, then astronomer at Cambridge, now Astronomer-Royal at Greenwich,\r\nand Mrs. Airy kindly wished us to be their guests; but as the\r\nObservatory was at some distance from Cambridge, it was decided that we\r\nshould have an apartment in Trinity College itself; an unusual favour\r\nwhere a lady is concerned. Mr. Sedgwick, the geologist, made the\r\narrangements, received us, and we spent the first day at dinner with\r\nhim. He is still alive[10]--one of my few coevals--either in Cambridge\r\nor England. The week we spent in Cambridge, receiving every honour from\r\nthe heads of the University, was a period of which I have ever borne a\r\nproud and grateful remembrance.\r\n\r\n    [Professor Sedgwick wrote as follows to my father:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM PROFESSOR SEDGWICK TO DR. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    TRINITY COLLEGE, _April, 1834_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    Your letter delighted us. I have ordered dinner on Thursday at 6-1/2\r\n    and shall have a small party to welcome you and Mrs. Somerville. In\r\n    order that we may not have to fight for you, we have been entering\r\n    on the best arrangements we can think of. On Tuesday you will, I\r\n    hope, dine with Peacock; on Wednesday with Whewell; on Thursday at\r\n    the Observatory. For Friday, Dr. Clarke, our Professor of Anatomy,\r\n    puts in a claim. For the other days of your visit we shall, D.V.,\r\n    find ample employment. A four-poster bed now (a thing utterly out of\r\n    our regular monastic system) will rear its head for you and Madame\r\n    in the chambers immediately below my own; and your handmaid may\r\n    safely rest her bones in a small inner chamber. Should Sheepshanks\r\n    return, we can stuff him into a lumber room of the observatory; but\r\n    of this there is no fear as I have written to him on the subject,\r\n    and he has no immediate intention of returning. You will of course\r\n    drive to the great gate of Trinity College, and my servant will be\r\n    in waiting at the Porter's lodge to show you the way to your\r\n    academic residence. We have no cannons at Trinity College, otherwise\r\n    we would fire a salute on your entry; we will however give you the\r\n    warmest greeting we can. Meanwhile give my best regards to Mrs. S.\r\n\r\n                             And believe me most truly yours,\r\n                                                        A. SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nLa Place had a profound veneration for Newton; he sent me a copy of his\r\n\"Système du Monde,\" and a letter, dated 15th August, 1824, in which he\r\nsays: \"Je publie successivement les divers livres du cinquième livre qui\r\ndoit terminer mon traité de 'Mécanique Céleste,' et dans cela je donne\r\nl'analyse historique des recherches des géomètres sur cette matière,\r\ncela m'a fait relire avec une attention particulière l'ouvrage si\r\nincomparable des principes mathématiques de la philosophie naturelle de\r\nNewton, qui contient le germe de toutes ses recherches. Plus j'ai étudié\r\ncet ouvrage plus il m'a paru admirable, en me transportant surtout à\r\nl'époque où il a été publié. Mais en même tems que je sens l'élégance de\r\nla méthode synthétique suivant laquelle Newton a présenté ses\r\ndécouvertes, j'ai reconnu l'indispensable nécessité de l'analyse pour\r\napprofondir les questions très difficiles que Newton n'a pu qu'effleurer\r\npar la synthèse. Je vois avec un grand plaisir vos mathématiciens se\r\nlivrer maintenant à l'analyse et je ne doute point qu'en suivant cette\r\nméthode avec la sagacité propre à votre nation ils ne seront conduits à\r\nd'importantes découvertes.\"\r\n\r\nNewton himself was aware that by the law of gravitation the stability of\r\nthe solar system was endangered. The power of analysis alone enabled La\r\nGrange to prove that all the disturbances arising from the reciprocal\r\nattraction of the planets and satellites are periodical, whatever the\r\nlength of the periods may be, so that the stability of the solar system\r\nis insured for unlimited ages. The perturbations are only the\r\noscillations of that immense pendulum of Eternity which beats centuries\r\nas ours beats seconds.\r\n\r\nLa Place, and all the great mathematicians of that period, had scarcely\r\npassed away when the more powerful Quaternion system began to dawn.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Professor Sedgwick died shortly after my mother.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPARIS--ARAGO, LAFAYETTE, MM. BOUVARD, POISSON, LACROIX, &c., MARQUISE DE\r\nLA PLACE, DUPIN, F. COOPER--LEGITIMISTE SOCIETY--MAJENDIE--VISIT BARON\r\nLOUIS--LETTER FROM LAFAYETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy health was never good at Chelsea, and as I had been working too hard,\r\nI became so ill, that change of air and scene were thought absolutely\r\nnecessary for me. We went accordingly to Paris; partly, because it was\r\nnear home, as Somerville could not remain long with us at a time, and,\r\npartly, because we thought it a good opportunity to give masters to the\r\ngirls, which we could not afford to do in London. When we arrived, I was\r\nso weak, that I always remained in bed writing till one o'clock, and\r\nthen, either went to sit in the Tuileries gardens, or else received\r\nvisits. All my old friends came to see me, Arago, the first. He was more\r\nengaged in politics than science, and as party spirit ran very high at\r\nthat time, he said he would send tickets of admission to the Chambers\r\nevery time there was likely to be an \"orage.\" When I told him what I was\r\nwriting, he gave me some interesting memoirs, and lent me a mass of\r\nmanuscripts, with leave to make extracts, which were very useful to me.\r\nGeneral de La Fayette came to town on purpose to invite Somerville and\r\nme to visit him at La Grange, where we found him living like a\r\npatriarch, surrounded by his family to the fourth generation. He was\r\nmild, highly distinguished, and noble in his manners; his conversation\r\nwas exceedingly interesting, as he readily spoke of the Revolution in\r\nwhich he had taken so active a part. Among other anecdotes, he\r\nmentioned, that he had sent the principal key of the Bastile to General\r\nWashington, who kept it under a glass case. He was much interested to\r\nhear that I could, in some degree, claim a kind of relationship with\r\nWashington, whose mother was a Fairfax. Baron Fairfax, the head of the\r\nfamily, being settled in America, had joined the independent party at\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe two daughters of La Fayette, who had been in prison with him at\r\nOlmütz, were keen politicians, and discussed points with a warmth of\r\ngesticulation which amused Somerville and me, accustomed to our cold\r\nstill manners. The grand-daughters, Mesdames de Rémusat and de\r\nCorcelles, were kind friends to me all the time I was in Paris.\r\n\r\nM. Bouvard, whom we had known in London, was now Astronomer-Royal of\r\nFrance, and he invited us to dine with him at the Observatory. The table\r\nwas surrounded by savants, who complimented me on the \"Mechanism of the\r\nHeavens.\" I sat next M. Poisson, who advised me in the strongest manner\r\nto write a second volume, so as to complete the account of La Place's\r\nworks; and he afterwards told Somerville, that there were not twenty men\r\nin France who could read my book. M. Arago, who was of the party, said,\r\nhe had not written to thank me for my book, because he had been reading\r\nit, and was busy preparing an account of it for the Journal of the\r\nInstitute. At this party, I made the acquaintance of the celebrated\r\nastronomer, M. Pontécoulant, and soon after, of M. La Croix, to whose\r\nworks I was indebted for my knowledge of the highest branches of\r\nmathematics. M. Prony, and M. Poinsot, came to visit me, the latter, an\r\namiable and gentlemanly person; both gave me a copy of their works.\r\n\r\nWe had a long visit from M. Biot, who seemed really glad to renew our\r\nold friendship. He was making experiments on light, though much out of\r\nhealth; but when we dined with him and Madame Biot, he forgot for the\r\ntime his bad health, and resumed his former gaiety. They made us promise\r\nto visit them at their country-house when we returned to England, as it\r\nlay on our road.\r\n\r\nTo my infinite regret, La Place had been dead some time; the Marquise\r\nwas still at Arcueil, and we went to see her. She received us with the\r\ngreatest warmth, and devoted herself to us the whole time we were in\r\nParis. As soon as she came to town, we went to make a morning visit; it\r\nwas past five o'clock; we were shown into a beautiful drawing-room, and\r\nthe man-servant, without knocking at the door, went into the room which\r\nwas adjacent, and we heard her call out, \"J'irai la voir! j'irai la\r\nvoir!\" and when the man-servant came out, he said, \"Madame est désolée,\r\nmais elle est en chemise.\" Madame de La Place was exceedingly agreeable,\r\nthe life of every party, with her cheerful gay manner. She was in great\r\nfavour with the Royal Family, and was always welcome when she went to\r\nvisit them in an evening. She received once a week, and her\r\ngrand-daughter, only nineteen, lovely and graceful, was an ornament to\r\nher parties. She was already married to M. de Colbert, whose father fell\r\nat Corunna.\r\n\r\nNo one was more attentive to me than Dr. Milne-Edwards, the celebrated\r\nnatural historian. He was the first Englishman who was elected a member\r\nof the Institute. I was indebted to him for the acquaintance of MM.\r\nAmpère and Becquerel. I believe Dr. Edwards was at that time writing on\r\nPhysiology, and, in conversation, I happened to mention that the wild\r\nducks in the fens, at Lincolnshire, always build their nests on high\r\ntufts of grass, or reeds, to save them from sudden floods; and that Sir\r\nJohn Sebright had raised wild ducks under a hen, which built their nests\r\non tufts of grass as if they had been in the fens. Dr. Edwards begged of\r\nme to inquire for how many generations that instinct lasted.\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame Gay Lussac lived in the Jardin des Plantes. Madame\r\nwas only twenty-one, exceedingly pretty, and well-educated; she read\r\nEnglish and German, painted prettily, and was a musician. She told me it\r\nhad been computed, that if all the property in France were equally\r\ndivided among the population, each person would have 150 francs a-year,\r\nor four sous per day; so that if anyone should spend eight sous a-day,\r\nsome other person would starve.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Broglie, Madame de Staël's daughter, called, and invited\r\nus to her receptions, which were the most brilliant in Paris. Every\r\nperson of distinction was there, French or foreign, generally four or\r\nfive men to one woman. The Duchess was a charming woman, both handsome\r\nand amiable, and received with much grace. The Duke was, then, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs. They were remarkable for their domestic virtues,\r\nas well as for high intellectual cultivation. The part the Duke took in\r\npolitics is so well known, that I need not allude to it here.\r\n\r\nAt some of these parties I met with Madame Charles Dupin, whom I liked\r\nmuch. When I went to return her visit, she received us in her bedroom.\r\nShe was a fashionable and rather elegant woman, with perfect manners.\r\nShe invited us to dinner to meet her brother-in-law, the President of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies. He was animated and witty, very fat, and more\r\nugly than his brother, but both were clever and agreeable. The President\r\ninvited me to a very brilliant ball he gave, but as it was on a Sunday I\r\ncould not accept the invitation. We went one evening with Madame Charles\r\nDupin to be introduced to Madame de Rumford. Her first husband,\r\nLavoisier, the chemist, had been guillotined at the Revolution, and she\r\nwas now a widow, but had lived long separated from her second husband.\r\nShe was enormously rich, and had a magnificent palace, garden, and\r\nconservatory, in which she gave balls and concerts. At all the evening\r\nparties in Paris the best bedroom was lighted up for reception like the\r\nother rooms. Madame de Rumford was capricious and ill-tempered; however,\r\nshe received me very well, and invited me to meet a very large party at\r\ndinner. Mr. Fenimore Cooper, the American novelist, with his wife and\r\ndaughter, were among the guests. I found him extremely amiable and\r\nagreeable, which surprised me, for when I knew him in England he was so\r\ntouchy that it was difficult to converse with him without giving him\r\noffence. He was introduced to Sir Walter Scott by Sir James Mackintosh,\r\nwho said, in presenting him, \"Mr. Cooper, allow me to introduce you to\r\nyour great forefather in the art of fiction\"; \"Sir,\" said Cooper, with\r\ngreat asperity, \"I have no forefather.\" Now, though his manners were\r\nrough, they were quite changed. We saw a great deal of him, and I was\r\nfrequently in his house, and found him perfectly liberal; so much so,\r\nthat he told us the faults of his country with the greatest frankness,\r\nyet he was the champion of America, and hated England.\r\n\r\nNone were kinder to us than Lord and Lady Granville. Lady Granville\r\ninvited us to all her parties; and when Somerville was obliged to return\r\nto England, she assured him that in case of any disturbance, we should\r\nfind a refuge in the Embassy. I went to some balls at the Tuileries with\r\nMadame de Lafayette Lasteyrie and her sister. The Queen Amélie was tall,\r\nthin, and very fair, not pretty, but infinitely more regal than\r\nAdelaide, Queen of England, at that time. The Royal Family used to walk\r\nabout in the streets of Paris without any attendants.\r\n\r\nSir Sydney Smith was still in Paris trying to renew the order of the\r\nKnights Templars. Somerville and I went with him one evening to a\r\nreception at the Duchesse d'Abrantés, widow of Junot. She was short,\r\nthick, and not in the least distinguished-looking, nor in any way\r\nremarkable. I had met her at the Duchesse de Broglie's, where she talked\r\nof Junot as if he had been in the next room. Sir Sydney was quite\r\ncovered with stars and crosses, and I was amused with the way he threw\r\nhis cloak back to display them as he handed me to the carriage.\r\n\r\nI met with Prince Kosloffsky everywhere; he was the fattest man I ever\r\nsaw, a perfect Falstaff. However, his intellect was not smothered, for\r\nhe would sit an hour with me talking about mathematics, astronomy,\r\nphilosophy, and what not. He was banished from Russia, and as he had\r\nbeen speaking imprudently about politics in Paris, he was ordered to go\r\nelsewhere; still, he lingered on, and was with me one morning when Pozzo\r\ndi Borgo, the Russian Ambassador called. Pozzo di Borgo said to me, \"Are\r\nyou aware that Prince Kosloffsky has left Paris?\" \"Oh yes,\" I said, \"I\r\nregret it much.\" He took the hint, and went away directly.\r\n\r\nI had hitherto been entirely among the Liberal set. How it came that I\r\nwas invited to dine with M. Héricourt de Thury, I do not remember. M. de\r\nThury was simple in his manners, and full of information; he had been\r\nDirector of the Mines under Napoleon, and had charge of the Public\r\nBuildings under Louis XVIII. and Charles X., but resigned his charges at\r\nthe Revolution of July. At this time the Duchesse de Berry was confined\r\nin the citadel of Blaye. She had a strong party in Paris, who furiously\r\nresented the treatment she met with. M. de Thury was a moderate\r\nLegitimiste, but Madame was ultra. When I happened to mention that we\r\nhad been staying with Lafayette, at La Grange, she was horrified, and\r\nbegged of me not to talk politics, or mention where we had been, or else\r\nsome of her guests would leave the room. The ladies of that party would\r\nnot dance or go to any gay party; they had a part of the theatre\r\nreserved for themselves; they wore high dark dresses with long sleeves,\r\ncalled \"Robes de Résistance,\" and even the Legitimiste newspapers\r\nappeared with black edges. They criticised those who gave balls, and\r\nLady Granville herself did not escape their censure. The marriage of the\r\nDuchesse de Berry to the Marchese Lucchesi Palli made an immense\r\nsensation; it was discussed in the salons in a truly French manner; it\r\nwas talked of in the streets; the Robes de Résistance were no longer\r\nworn, and the Legitimiste newspapers went out of mourning.\r\n\r\nAll parties criticised the British Administration in Ireland. A lady\r\nsitting by me at a party said, \"No wonder so many English prefer France\r\nto so odious a country as England, where the people are oppressed, and\r\neven cabbages are raised in hotbeds.\" I laughed, and said, \"I like\r\nEngland very well, for all that.\" An old gentleman, who was standing\r\nnear us, said, \"Whatever terms two countries may be on, it behoves us\r\nindividuals to observe good manners;\" and when I went away, this\r\ngentleman handed me to the carriage, though I had never seen him before.\r\n\r\nThe Marquise de La Place was commissioned by Dr. Majendie to invite me\r\nto meet her and Madame Gay Lussac at dinner. I was very unwilling to go;\r\nfor I detested the man for his wanton cruelties, but I found I could not\r\nrefuse on account of these ladies. There was a large party of _savants_,\r\nagreeable and gentlemanly; but Majendie himself had the coarsest\r\nmanners; his conversation was horridly professional; many things were\r\nsaid and subjects discussed not fit for women to hear. What a contrast\r\nthe refined and amiable Sir Charles Bell formed with Majendie! Majendie\r\nand the French school of anatomy made themselves odious by their\r\ncruelty, and failed to prove the true anatomy of the brain and nerves,\r\nwhile Sir Charles Bell did succeed, and thus made one of the greatest\r\nphysiological discoveries of the age without torturing animals, which\r\nhis gentle and kindly nature abhorred. To Lady Bell I am indebted for a\r\ncopy of her husband's Life. She is one of my few dear and valued friends\r\nwho are still alive.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhile in Paris, I lost my dear mother. She died at the age of ninety,\r\nattended by my brother Henry. She was still a fine old lady, with few\r\ngrey hairs. The fear of death was almost hereditary in the Charters\r\nfamily, and my mother possessed it in no small degree; yet when it came,\r\nshe was perfectly composed and prepared for it. I have never had that\r\nfear; may God grant that I may be as calm and prepared as she was.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI was in better health, but still so delicate that I wrote in bed till\r\none o'clock. The \"Connexion of the Physical Sciences\" was a tedious\r\nwork, and the proof sheets had to be sent through the Embassy.\r\n\r\nM. Arago told me that David, the sculptor, wished to make a medallion\r\nof me; so he came and sat an hour with me, and pleased me by his\r\nintelligent conversation and his enthusiasm for art. A day was fixed,\r\nand he took my profile on slate with pink wax, in a wonderfully short\r\ntime. He made me a present of a medallion in bronze, nicely framed, and\r\ntwo plaster casts for my daughters.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI frequently went to hear the debates in the Chambers, and occasionally\r\ntook my girls, as I thought it was an excellent lesson in French. As\r\nparty spirit ran very high, the scenes that occurred were very amusing.\r\nA member, in the course of his speech, happening to mention the word\r\n\"liberté,\" the President Dupin rang the bell, called out \"Stop, à propos\r\nde liberté,\" ... jumped down from his seat, sprung into the tribune,\r\npushed out the deputy, and made a long speech himself.\r\n\r\nThe weather being fine, we made excursions in the neighbourhood. At\r\nSèvres I saw two pieces of china; on one of them was a gnu, on the other\r\na zebra. Somerville had told me that soon after his return from his\r\nAfrican expedition, he had given the original drawings to M. Brongniart\r\nthen director of the manufactory.\r\n\r\nBaron Louis invited me to spend a day with him and his niece,\r\nMademoiselle de Rigny, at his country house, not far from Paris. I went\r\nwith Madame de la Place, and we set out early, to be in time for\r\nbreakfast. The road lay through the Forest of Vincennes. The Baron's\r\npark, which was close to the village of Petit-Brie, was very large, and\r\nrichly wooded; there were gardens, hot-houses, and all the luxuries of\r\nan English nobleman's residence. The house was handsome, with a\r\nmagnificent library; I remarked on the table the last numbers of the\r\n\"Edinburgh\" and \"Quarterly\" Reviews. Both the Baron and his niece were\r\nsimple and kind. I was greatly taken with both; the Baron had all the\r\nquiet elegance of the old school, and his niece had great learning and\r\nthe manners of a woman of fashion. She lived in perfect retirement,\r\nhaving suffered much in the time of the Revolution. They had both\r\neventful lives; for Baron Louis, who had been in orders, and Talleyrand\r\nofficiated at the Champs de Mars when Louis the Sixteenth took the oath\r\nto maintain the constitution. Field-Marshal Macdonald, Duc de Tarante,\r\nand his son-in-law, the Duc de Massa; Admiral de Rigny, Minister of\r\nMarine; M. Barthe, Garde des Sceaux; and the Bouvards, father and son,\r\nformed the party. After spending a most delightful and interesting day,\r\nwe drove to Paris in bright moonlight.\r\n\r\nOur friends in Paris and at La Grange had been so kind to us that we\r\nwere very sad when we went to express our gratitude and take leave of\r\nthem. We only stayed two days at La Grange, and when we returned to\r\nParis, Somerville went home and my son joined us, when we made a rapid\r\ntour in Switzerland, the only remarkable event of which was a singular\r\natmospheric phenomenon we saw on the top of the Grimsel. On the clouds\r\nof vapour below us we saw our shadows projected, of giant proportions,\r\nand each person saw his own shadow surrounded by a bright circle of\r\nprismatic colours. It is not uncommon in mountain regions.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [General Lafayette and all his family were extremely kind to my\r\n    mother. He was her constant visitor, and we twice visited him at his\r\n    country house, La Grange. He wished to persuade my mother to go\r\n    there for some days, after our return from Switzerland, which we did\r\n    not accomplish. The General wrote the following letter to my father:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM LAFAYETTE TO DR. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    LA GRANGE, _31st October, 1833_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n    I waited to answer your kind letter, for the arrival of Mr.\r\n    Coke's[11] precious gift, which nobody could higher value, on every\r\n    account, than the grateful farmer on whom it has been bestowed. The\r\n    heifers and bull are beautiful; they have reached La Grange in the\r\n    best order, and shall be tenderly attended to.... It has been a\r\n    great disappointment not to see Mrs. Somerville and the young ladies\r\n    before their departure. Had we not depended on their kind visit, we\r\n    should have gone to take leave of them. They have had the goodness\r\n    to regret the impossibility to come before their departure. Be so\r\n    kind as to receive the affectionate friendship and good wishes of a\r\n    family who are happy in the ties of mutual attachment that bind us\r\n    to you and them.... Public interest is now fixed upon the Peninsula,\r\n    and while dynasties are at civil war, and despotic or _juste milieu_\r\n    cabinets seem to agree in the fear of a genuine development of\r\n    popular institutions, the matter for the friends of freedom is to\r\n    know how far the great cause of Europe shall be forwarded by these\r\n    royal squabbles.\r\n\r\n    We shall remain at La Grange until the opening of the session,\r\n    hoping that, notwithstanding your and the ladies' absence, your\r\n    attention will not be quite withdrawn from our interior affairs--the\r\n    sympathy shall be reciprocal.\r\n\r\n                            With all my heart, I am\r\n                                    Your affectionate friend,\r\n                                                        LAFAYETTE.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Mr. Coke, of Holkham, afterwards Earl of Leicester.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nRETURN TO ENGLAND--LETTER FROM HALLAM--TREATISE ON THE FORM AND ROTATION\r\nOF THE EARTH AND PLANETS--SECOND EDITION OF \"CONNEXION OF PHYSICAL\r\nSCIENCES\"--LETTERS FROM MARIA EDGEWORTH, MISS BERRY, LORD BROUGHAM, MRS.\r\nMARCET, ADMIRAL SMYTH--DOUBLE STARS--ECLIPSE OF DOUBLE STARS--LETTER\r\nFROM ADMIRAL SMYTH--SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL--NEBULÆ--LETTER FROM LORD\r\nROSSE--LETTER FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL--SIR JAMES SOUTH'S OBSERVATORY--MR.\r\nJOHN MURRAY--MISS BERRY--LORD DUDLEY--MR.

It was dedicated to Queen Adelaide, who thanked\r\nme for it at a drawing-room. Some time after Somerville and I went to\r\nScotland; we had travelled all night in the mail coach, and when it\r\nbecame light, a gentleman who was in the carriage said to Somerville,\r\n\"Is not the lady opposite to me Mrs. Somerville, whose bust I saw at\r\nChantrey's?\" The gentleman was Mr. Sopwith, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, a\r\ncivil and mining engineer. He was distinguished for scientific\r\nknowledge, and had been in London to give information to a\r\nparliamentary committee. He travelled faster than we did, and when we\r\narrived at Newcastle he was waiting to take us to his house, where we\r\nwere hospitably received by Mrs. Sopwith. His conversation was highly\r\ninteresting, and to him I was indebted for much information on mining\r\ngenerally, and on the mineral wealth of Great Britain, while writing on\r\nPhysical Geography. Many years after he and Mrs. Sopwith came and saw me\r\nat Naples, which gave me much pleasure. He was unlike any other\r\ntraveller I ever met with, so profound and original were his\r\nobservations on all he saw.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn coming home I found that I had made an error in the first edition of\r\nthe \"Physical Sciences,\" in giving 365 days 6 hours as the length of the\r\ncivil year of the ancient Egyptians. My friend Mr. Hallam, the\r\nhistorian, wrote to me, proving from history and epochs of the\r\nchronology of the ancient Egyptians, that their civil year was only 365\r\ndays. I was grateful to that great and amiable man for copies of all his\r\nworks while he was alive, and I am obliged to his daughter for an\r\nexcellent likeness of him, now that he is no more.\r\n\r\n    FROM HENRY HALLAM, ESQ., TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    WIMPOLE STREET, _March 12th, 1835_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n    As you will probably soon be called upon for another edition of your\r\n    excellent work on the \"Connexion of the Physical Sciences,\" I think\r\n    you will excuse the liberty I take in mentioning to you one passage\r\n    which seems to have escaped your attention in so arduous a labour.\r\n    It is in page 104, where you have this sentence:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Egyptians estimated the year at 365 d. 6 h., by which they lost\r\n    one year in every 14,601, their Sothiac period. They determined the\r\n    length of their year by the heliacal rising of Sirius, 2782 years\r\n    before the Christian era, which is the earliest epoch of Egyptian\r\n    chronology.\"\r\n\r\n    The Egyptian civil year was of 365 days only, as we find in\r\n    Herodotus, and I apprehend there is no dispute about it. The Sothiac\r\n    period, or that cycle in which the heliacal rising of Sirius passed\r\n    the whole civil year, and took place again on the same day, was of\r\n    1461 years, not 14,601. If they had adopted a year of 365 d. 6 h.,\r\n    this period would have been more than three times 14,601; the excess\r\n    of the sidereal year above that being only 9' 9\", which will not\r\n    amount to a day in less than about 125 years.\r\n\r\n    I do not see how the heliacal rising of Sirius in any one year could\r\n    help them to determine its length. By comparing two successive years\r\n    they could of course have got at a sidereal year; but this is what\r\n    they did not do; hence the irregularity which produced the canicular\r\n    cycle. The commencement of that cycle is placed by ancient\r\n    chronologers in 1322 A.C. It seems not correct to call 2782 A.C.\r\n    \"the earliest epoch of Egyptian chronology,\" for we have none of\r\n    their chronology nearly so old, and in fact no chronology, properly\r\n    so called, has yet been made out by our Egyptian researches. It is\r\n    indeed certain that, if the reckoning by heliacal risings of Sirius\r\n    did not begin in 1322, we must go nearly 1460 years back for its\r\n    origin; since it must have been adopted when that event preceded\r\n    only for a short time the annual inundation of the Nile. But,\r\n    according to some, the year 1322 A.C. fell during the reign of\r\n    Sesostris, to whom Herodotus ascribes several regulations connected\r\n    with the rising of the Nile. Certainly, 2782 A.C. is a more remote\r\n    era than we are hitherto warranted to assume for any astronomical\r\n    observation.\r\n\r\n                     Believe me, dear Mrs. Somerville,\r\n                                          Very truly yours,\r\n                                                    HENRY HALLAM.\r\n\r\n    I refer you to Montucla, if you have any doubt about the Egyptian\r\n    year being of 365 days without bissextile of any kind.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI had sent a copy of the \"Mechanism of the Heavens\" to M. Poisson soon\r\nafter it was published, and I had received a letter from him dated 30th\r\nMay, 1832, advising me to complete the work by writing a volume on the\r\nform and rotation of the earth and planets. Being again strongly advised\r\nto do so while in Paris, I now began the work, and, in consequence, I\r\nwas led into a correspondence with Mr. Ivory, who had written on the\r\nsubject, and also with Mr. Francis Baily, on the density and compression\r\nof the earth. My work was extensive, for it comprised the analytical\r\nattraction of spheroids, the form and rotation of the earth, the tides\r\nof the ocean and atmosphere, and small undulations.\r\n\r\nWhen this was finished, I had nothing to do, and as I preferred analysis\r\nto all other subjects, I wrote a work of 246 pages on curves and\r\nsurfaces of the second and higher orders. While writing this, _con\r\namore_, a new edition of the \"Physical Sciences\" was much needed, so I\r\nput on high pressure and worked at both. Had these two manuscripts been\r\npublished at that time, they might have been of use; I do not remember\r\nwhy they were laid aside, and forgotten till I found them years\r\nafterwards among my papers. Long after the time I am writing about,\r\nwhile at Naples, I amused myself by repairing the time-worn parts of\r\nthese manuscripts, and was surprised to find that in my eighty-ninth\r\nyear I still retained facility in the \"Calculus.\"\r\n\r\nThe second edition of the \"Physical Sciences\" was dedicated to my dear\r\nfriend, Sir John Herschel. It went through nine editions, and has been\r\ntranslated into German and Italian. The book went through various\r\neditions in the United States, to the honour, but not to the profit, of\r\nthe author. However, the publisher obligingly sent me a copy. I must say\r\nthat profit was never an object with me: I wrote because it was\r\nimpossible for me to be idle.\r\n\r\nI had the honour of presenting a copy of my book to the Duchess of Kent\r\nat a private audience. The Duchess and Princess Victoria were alone, and\r\nreceived me very graciously, and conversed for half an hour with me. As\r\nI mentioned before, I saw the young Princess crowned: youthful, almost\r\nchild-like as she was, she went through the imposing ceremony with all\r\nthe dignity of a Queen.\r\n\r\n    [A few letters from some of my mother's friends, written at this\r\n    period, may prove of interest. They are chiefly written to thank her\r\n    for copies of the Preliminary Dissertation or of the \"Physical\r\n    Sciences.\" One from Lord Brougham concerns my mother's estimate of\r\n    the scientific merit of Dr. Young, for whom she had the sincerest\r\n    admiration, considering him one of the first philosophers and\r\n    discoverers of the age.]\r\n\r\n    FROM MISS EDGEWORTH TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    EDGWORTHTOWN, _May 31st, 1832_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    There is one satisfaction at least in giving knowledge to the\r\n    ignorant, to those who know their ignorance at least, that they are\r\n    grateful and humble. You should have my grateful and humble thanks\r\n    long ago for the favour--the honour--you did me by sending me that\r\n    Preliminary Dissertation, in which there is so much knowledge, but\r\n    that I really wished to read it over and over again at some\r\n    intervals of time, and to have the pleasure of seeing my sister\r\n    Harriet read it, before I should write to you. She has come to us,\r\n    and has just been enjoying it, as I knew she would. For my part, I\r\n    was long in the state of the boa constrictor after a full meal--and\r\n    I am but just recovering the powers of motion. My mind was so\r\n    distended by the magnitude, the immensity, of what you put into it!\r\n    I am afraid that if you had been aware how ignorant I was you would\r\n    not have sent me this dissertation, because you would have felt that\r\n    you were throwing away much that I could not understand, and that\r\n    could be better bestowed on scientific friends capable of judging of\r\n    what they admire. I can only assure you that you have given me a\r\n    great deal of pleasure; that you have enlarged my conception of the\r\n    sublimity of the universe, beyond any ideas I had ever before been\r\n    enabled to form.\r\n\r\n    The great simplicity of your manner of writing, I may say of your\r\n    _mind_, which appears in your writing, particularly suits the\r\n    scientific sublime--which would be destroyed by what is commonly\r\n    called fine writing. You trust sufficiently to the natural interest\r\n    of your subject, to the importance of the facts, the beauty of the\r\n    whole, and the adaptation of the means to the ends, in every part of\r\n    the immense whole. This reliance upon your reader's feeling along\r\n    with you, was to me very gratifying. The ornaments of eloquence\r\n    dressing out a sublime subject are just so many proofs either of bad\r\n    taste in the orator, or of distrust and contempt of the taste of\r\n    those whom he is trying thus to captivate.\r\n\r\n    I suppose nobody yet has completely _mastered_ the tides, therefore\r\n    I may well content myself with my inability to comprehend what\r\n    relates to them. But instead of plaguing you with an endless\r\n    enumeration of my difficulties, I had better tell you some of the\r\n    passages which gave me, ignoramus as I am, peculiar pleasure.... I\r\n    am afraid I shall transcribe your whole book if I go on to tell you\r\n    all that has struck me, and you would not thank me for that--you,\r\n    who have so little vanity, and so much to do better with your time\r\n    than to read _my_ ignorant admiration. But pray let me mention to\r\n    you a few of the passages that amused my imagination particularly,\r\n    viz., 1st, the inhabitant of Pallas _going round_ his world--or who\r\n    might go--in five or six hours in one of our steam carriages; 2nd,\r\n    the moderate-sized man who would weigh two tons at the surface of\r\n    the sun--and who would weigh only a few pounds at the surface of the\r\n    four new planets, and would be so light as to find it impossible to\r\n    stand from the excess of muscular force! I think a very entertaining\r\n    dream might be made of a man's visit to the sun and planets--these\r\n    ideas are all like dreamy feelings when one is a little feverish. I\r\n    forgot to mention (page 58) a passage on the propagation of sound.\r\n    It is a beautiful sentence, as well as a sublime idea, \"so that at a\r\n    very small height above the surface of the earth, the noise of the\r\n    tempest ceases and the thunder is heard no more in those boundless\r\n    regions, where the heavenly bodies accomplish their periods in\r\n    eternal and sublime silence.\"\r\n\r\n    Excuse me in my trade of sentence-monger, and believe me, dear\r\n    Mrs. Somerville, truly your obliged and truly your affectionate\r\n    friend,\r\n\r\n                                                    MARIA EDGEWORTH.\r\n\r\n    I have persuaded your dear curly-headed friend, Harriet, to add her\r\n    own observations; she sends her love to you; and I know you love\r\n    her, otherwise I would not press her to write her own _say_.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MISS JOANNA BAILLIE TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    HAMPSTEAD, _February 1st, 1832_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I am now, thank God! recovered from a very heavy disease, but still\r\n    very weak. I will not, however, delay any longer my grateful\r\n    acknowledgments for your very flattering gift of your Preliminary\r\n    Dissertation. Indeed, I feel myself greatly honoured by receiving\r\n    such a mark of regard from one who has done more to remove the light\r\n    estimation in which the capacity of women is too often held, than\r\n    all that has been accomplished by the whole sisterhood of poetical\r\n    damsels and novel-writing authors. I could say much more on this\r\n    subject were I to follow my own feelings; but I am still so weak\r\n    that writing is a trouble to me, and I have nearly done all that I\r\n    am able.\r\n\r\n                                   God bless and prosper you!\r\n                                        Yours gratefully and truly,\r\n                                                           J. BAILLIE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MISS BERRY TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    BELLEVUE, _18th September, 1834_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I have just finished reading your book, which has entertained me\r\n    extremely, and at the same time, I hope, improved my moral character\r\n    in the Christian virtue of humility. These must appear to you such\r\n    _odd_ results--so little like those produced on the great majority\r\n    of your readers, that you must allow me to explain them to you.\r\n    Humbled, I must be, by finding my own intellect unequal to\r\n    following, beyond a first step, the explanations by which you seek\r\n    to make easy to comprehension the marvellous phenomena of the\r\n    universe--humbled, by feeling the intellectual difference between\r\n    you and me, placing you as much above me in the scale of reasoning\r\n    beings, as I am above my dog. Still I rejoice with humility at\r\n    feeling myself, in that order of understandings which, although\r\n    utterly incapable of following the chain of your reasonings,\r\n    calculations, and inductions--utterly deprived of the powers\r\n    necessary _sic itur ad astra_--am yet informed, enlightened, and\r\n    entertained with the series of sublime truths to which you conduct\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    In some foggy morning of November, I shall drive out to you at\r\n    Chelsea and surprise you with my ignorance of science, by asking you\r\n    to explain to me some things which you will _wonder any one_ can\r\n    have so long existed without knowing. In the mean time, I wish you\r\n    could read in any combination of the stars the probability of our\r\n    often having such a season as this, of uninterrupted summer since\r\n    April last, and when last week it was sobering into autumn, has now\r\n    returned to enter summer again. The thermometer was at 83° in the\r\n    shade yesterday, and to-day promises to be as much. We are delighted\r\n    with our two months' residence at this place, which we shall see\r\n    with regret draw towards a close the end of this month. October we\r\n    mean to spend at Paris, before we return to the _nebulosities_ of\r\n    London. During my residence in Paris, before we came here, I never\r\n    had the good luck to meet with your friend M. Arago; had I not been\r\n    reading your book, I should have begged you to give me a letter for\r\n    him. But as it is, and as my stay at Paris will now be so short, I\r\n    shall content myself with looking up at a respectful distance to all\r\n    your great fixed stars of science, excepting always yourself, dear\r\n    Mrs. Somerville. No \"disturbing influence\" will, I hope, ever throw\r\n    me out of the orbit of _your_ intimacy and friendship, whose value,\r\n    believe me, is most duly and accurately calculated by your ignorant\r\n    but very affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n                                                            M. BERRY.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM LORD BROUGHAM TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    1834.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for the sheets, which I have read with equal pleasure\r\n    and instruction as those I formerly had from you. One or two things\r\n    I could have troubled you with, but they are of little moment. I\r\n    shall note them. The only one that is at all material relates to the\r\n    way you mention Dr. Young--not that I object to the word\r\n    \"illustrious,\" or as applied to him. But as you don't give it to one\r\n    considerably more so, it looks either as if you overrated him, or\r\n    underrated Davy, or (which I suppose to be the truth) as if you\r\n    felt Young had not had his due share of honour, and desired to make\r\n    it up to his memory. Observe I give him a very high place--but\r\n    Davy's discoveries are both of more unquestioned originality and\r\n    more undoubtedly true--perhaps I should say, more brought to a\r\n    close. The alkalis and the principle of the safety lamp are\r\n    concluded and fixed, the undulation is in progress, and somewhat\r\n    uncertain as to how and where it may end. You will please to observe\r\n    that I reckon both those capital discoveries of Davy the fruit of\r\n    inquiry, and not at all of chance--for, as to the lamp, it is plain;\r\n    and as to the metals, if you look at the inquiries that immediately\r\n    preceded, you will see he was thereby led to the alkalis. Indeed, I\r\n    well remember saying, when I read them, \"He will analyse lime and\r\n    barytes.\" I am quite ready to admit his extreme folly in some\r\n    things, but that is nothing to the present purpose.\r\n\r\n                                               Yours,\r\n                                                   H.B.\r\n                                           (_Henry Brougham._)\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. MARCET TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    GENEVA, _6th April, 1834_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I am desired by Professor Prevost to inform you that you were\r\n    elected an honorary member of the Société de Physique et d'Histoire\r\n    Naturelle de Genève on the 3rd April, and that a diploma will be\r\n    forwarded to you by the earliest opportunity. After all the honours\r\n    you have received, this little feather is hardly worthy of waving in\r\n    your plume, but I am glad that Geneva should know how to appreciate\r\n    your merit. You receive great honours, my dear friend, but that\r\n    which you confer on our sex is still greater, for with talents and\r\n    acquirements of masculine magnitude you unite the most sensitive and\r\n    retiring modesty of the female sex; indeed, I know not any woman,\r\n    perhaps I might say, any human being, who would support so much\r\n    applause without feeling the weakness of vanity. Forgive me for\r\n    allowing my pen to run away with this undisguised praise, it looks\r\n    so much like compliment, but I assure you it comes straight from the\r\n    heart, and you _must_ know that it is fully deserved.... I know not\r\n    whether you have heard of the death of Professor de la Rive (the\r\n    father); it was an unexpected blow, which has fallen heavily on all\r\n    his family. It is indeed a great loss to Geneva, both as a man of\r\n    science and a most excellent citizen.\r\n\r\n    M. Rossi[12] has left us to occupy the chair of political economy of\r\n    the late M. Say, at Paris; his absence is sadly felt, and it is in\r\n    vain to look around for any one capable of replacing him....\r\n\r\n                                          Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                          J. MARCET.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM ADMIRAL W.H. SMYTH TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    CRESCENT, BEDFORD, _October 3rd, 1835_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n    As an opportunity offers of sending a note to town, I beg to mention\r\n    that I have somewhat impatiently waited for some appearance of\r\n    settled weather, in order to press your coming here to inspect\r\n    Halley's comet, before it should have become visible to the\r\n    unassisted eye. That unerring monitor, however, the barometer, held\r\n    forth no hope, and the ceaseless traveller is already an object of\r\n    conspicuous distinction without artificial aid, except, perhaps, to\r\n    most eyes an opera-glass, magnifying three or four times, will be\r\n    found a pleasant addition. It is now gliding along with wonderful\r\n    celerity, and the nucleus is very bright. It is accompanied with a\r\n    great luminosity, and the nucleus has changed its position therein;\r\n    that is, on the 29th August, the nucleus was like a minute star near\r\n    the centre of the nebulous envelope; on the 2nd September it\r\n    appeared in the _n. f._ quarter, and latterly it has been in the _s.\r\n    f._\r\n\r\n    How remarkable that the month of August this year should rattle\r\n    Halley's name throughout the globe, in identity with an astonishing\r\n    scientific triumph, and that in the selfsame month the letters of\r\n    Flamsteed should have appeared! How I wish some one would give us a\r\n    life of Newton, with all the interesting documents that exist of his\r\n    labours! Till such appears, Flamsteed's statements, though bearing\r\n    strong internal evidence of truth, are _ex-parte_, and it is evident\r\n    his anxiety made him prone to impute motives which he could not\r\n    prove. The book is painfully interesting, but except in all that\r\n    relates to the personal character of Flamsteed, I could almost have\r\n    wished the documents had been destroyed. People of judgment well\r\n    know that men without faults are monsters, but vulgar minds delight\r\n    in seeing the standard of human excellence lowered.\r\n\r\n                                             Dear Madam,\r\n                                                Yours faithfully,\r\n                                                         W.H. SMYTH.\r\n\r\nWe were deprived of the society of Sir John and Lady Herschel for four\r\nyears, because Sir John took his telescope and other instruments to the\r\nCape of Good Hope, where he went, accompanied by his family, for the\r\npurpose of observing the celestial phenomena of the southern hemisphere.\r\nThere are more than 6,000 double stars in the northern hemisphere, in a\r\nlarge proportion of which the angle of position and distance between the\r\ntwo stars have been measured, and Sir John determined, in the same\r\nmanner, 1081 in the southern hemisphere, and I believe many additions\r\nhave been made to them since that time. In many of these one star\r\nrevolves rapidly round the other. The elliptical orbits and periodical\r\ntimes of sixteen or seventeen of these stellar systems have been\r\ndetermined. In Gamma Virginis the two stars are nearly of the same\r\nmagnitude, and were so far apart in the middle of the last century that\r\nthey were considered to be quite independent of each other. Since then\r\nthey have been gradually approaching one another, till, in March, 1836,\r\nI had a letter from Admiral Smyth, informing me that he had seen one of\r\nthe stars eclipse the other, from his observatory at Bedford.\r\n\r\n    FROM ADMIRAL SMYTH TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    CRESCENT, BEDFORD, _March 26th, 1836_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n    Knowing the great interest you take in sidereal astronomy, of which\r\n    so little is yet known, I trust it will not be an intrusion to tell\r\n    you of a new, extraordinary, and very unexpected fact, in the\r\n    complete occultation of one \"fixed\" star by another, under\r\n    circumstances which admit of no possible doubt or equivocation.\r\n\r\n    You are aware that I have been measuring the position and distance\r\n    of the two stars [Greek: g]^1 and [Greek: g]^2 Virginis, which are both\r\n    nearly of similar magnitudes, and also, that they have approximated to\r\n    each other very rapidly. They were very close last year, and I expected\r\n    to find they had crossed each other at this apparition, but to my\r\n    surprise I find they have become a fair round disc, which my highest\r\n    powers will not elongate--in fact, _a single star_! I shall watch\r\n    with no little interest for the reappearance of the second [Greek: g].\r\n\r\n                                    My dear madam,\r\n                                          Your truly obliged servant,\r\n                                                            W.H. SMYTH.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThis eclipse was also seen by Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, as well as by many astronomers in Europe provided with instruments\r\nof great optical power. In 1782 Sir William Herschel saw one of the\r\nstars of Zeta Herculis eclipse the other.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Connexion of the Physical Sciences\" I have given an abridged\r\naccount of Sir John Herschel's most remarkable discoveries in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere; but I may mention here that he determined the\r\nposition and made accurate drawings of all the nebulæ that were\r\ndistinctly visible in his 20 ft. telescope. The work he published will\r\nbe a standard for ascertaining the changes that may take place in these\r\nmysterious objects for ages to come. Sir William Herschel had determined\r\nthe places of 2,500 nebulæ in the northern hemisphere; they were\r\nexamined by his son, and drawings made of some of the most remarkable,\r\nbut when these nebulæ were viewed through Lord Rosse's telescope, they\r\npresented a very different appearance, showing that the apparent form of\r\nthe nebulæ depends upon the space-penetrating power of the telescope, a\r\ncircumstance of vital importance in observing the changes which time may\r\nproduce on these wonderful objects.\r\n\r\n    [Long afterwards Lord Rosse wrote in reply to some questions which\r\n    my mother had addressed to him on this subject:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM THE EARL OF ROSSE TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    CASTLE, PARSONSTOWN, _June 12th, 1844_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I have very reluctantly postponed so long replying to your\r\n    inquiries respecting the telescope, but there were some points upon\r\n    which I was anxious to be enabled to speak more precisely. The\r\n    instrument we are now using is 3 feet aperture, and 27 feet focus,\r\n    and in the greater proportion of the nebulæ which have been observed\r\n    with it some new details have been brought out. Perhaps the most\r\n    interesting general result is that, as far as we have gone,\r\n    increasing optical power has enlarged the list of clusters, by\r\n    diminishing that of the nebulæ properly so-called. Such has always\r\n    been the case since the nebulæ have been observed with telescopes,\r\n    and although it would be unsafe to draw the inference, it is\r\n    impossible not to feel some expectation that with sufficient optical\r\n    power the nebulæ would all be reduced into clusters. Perhaps the two\r\n    of the most remarkable of the resolved nebulæ are Fig. 26 and Fig.\r\n    55. In several of the planetary nebulæ we have discovered a star or\r\n    bright point in the centre, and a filamentous edge, which is just\r\n    the appearance which a cluster with a highly condensed centre would\r\n    present in a small instrument. For instance, Figs. 47 and 32. We\r\n    have also found that many of the nebulæ have not a symmetrical form,\r\n    as they appear to have in inferior instruments; for instance, Fig.\r\n    81 is a cluster with long resolvable filaments from its southern\r\n    extremity, and Fig. 85 is an oblong cluster with a bright centre.\r\n    Fig. 45 is an annular nebula, like Herschel's drawing of the annular\r\n    nebula in Lyra. I have sent drawings of a few of these objects to\r\n    the Royal Society, they were forwarded a few days ago. We have upon\r\n    the whole as yet observed but little with the telescope of 3 feet\r\n    aperture. You recollect Herschel said that it was a good observing\r\n    year, in which there were 100 hours fit for observing, and of the\r\n    average of our hours I have not employed above 30. We have been for\r\n    the last two years engaged in constructing a telescope of 6 feet\r\n    aperture and 52 feet focus, and it would have been impossible to\r\n    have bestowed the necessary attention upon it had we made a business\r\n    of observing. That instrument is nearly finished, and I hope it will\r\n    effect something for astronomy. The unequal refraction of the\r\n    atmosphere will limit its powers, but how far remains to be\r\n    ascertained.... Lady Rosse joins me in very kind remembrances and\r\n    believe me to be,\r\n\r\n                                 Dear Mrs. Somerville,\r\n                                       Yours very truly and ever,\r\n                                                              ROSSE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [Sir John Herschel wrote to my father from the Cape:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL TO MR. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    FELDHAUSEN, NEAR WYNBERG, C.G.H., _July 17th, 1830_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    Since our arrival here, I have, I know in many instances, maintained\r\n    or established the character of a bad correspondent; and really it\r\n    is not an inconvenient character to have established. Only, in your\r\n    case, I should be very sorry to appear in that, or any other\r\n    negligent or naughty light; but you, I know, will allow for the\r\n    circumstances which have occasioned my silence. Meanwhile, I am not\r\n    sorry that the execution of an intention I had more than once formed\r\n    should have been deferred, till we read in the papers of the\r\n    well-judged and highly creditable notice (creditable I mean to the\r\n    government _pro tempore_) which His Majesty has been pleased to take\r\n    of Mrs. Somerville's elaborate works. Although the Royal notice is\r\n    not quite so swift as the lightning in the selection of its objects,\r\n    it agrees with it in this, that it is attracted by the loftiest; and\r\n    though what she has performed may seem so natural and easy to\r\n    herself, that she may blush to find it fame; all the rest of the\r\n    world will agree with me in rejoicing that merit of that kind is\r\n    felt and recognised at length in the high places of the earth. This,\r\n    and the honourable mention of Airy by men of both parties in the\r\n    House of Commons about the same time, are things that seem to mark\r\n    the progress of the age we live in; and I give Peel credit for his\r\n    tact in perceiving this mode of making a favourable impression on\r\n    the public mind.\r\n\r\n    We are all going on very comfortably, and continue to like the\r\n    Cape as a place of (temporary) residence as much or more than at\r\n    first. The climate is so very delicious.... The stars are most\r\n    propitious, and, astronomically speaking, I can now declare the\r\n    climate to be most excellent. Night after night, for weeks and\r\n    months, with hardly an interruption, of _perfect_ astronomical\r\n    weather, discs of stars reduced almost to points, and tranquilly\r\n    gliding across the field of your telescope. It is really a treat,\r\n    such as occurs once or perhaps twice a year in England--hardly more.\r\n    I had almost forgotten that by a recent vote of the Astronomical\r\n    Society I can now claim Mrs. Somerville as a _colleague_. Pray make\r\n    my compliments to her in that capacity, and tell her that I hope to\r\n    meet her there at some future session....\r\n\r\n                                         Yours very faithfully,\r\n                                                      H.W. HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n    TO WILLIAM SOMERVILLE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSpectrum analysis has shown that there is a vast quantity of\r\nself-luminous gaseous matter in space, incapable of being reduced into\r\nstars, however powerful the telescope through which it is observed.\r\nHence the old opinion once more prevails, that this is the matter of\r\nwhich the sun and stellar systems have been formed, and that other\r\nstellar systems are being formed by slow, continuous condensation. The\r\nprincipal constituents of this matter are, the terrestrial gases,\r\nhydrogen, and nitrogen. The yellow stars, like the sun, contain\r\nterrestrial matter. The nebulous and stellar constituents were chiefly\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Huggins.\r\n\r\nSomerville and I were always made welcome by Sir James South, and at\r\nCampden Hill I learnt the method of observing, and sometimes made\r\nobservations myself on the double stars and binary systems, which,\r\nworthless as they were, enabled me to describe better what others had\r\ndone. One forenoon Somerville and I went to pay a visit to Lady South.\r\nSir James, who was present, said, \"Come to the observatory, and measure\r\nthe distance of Mercury from the sun; for they are in close\r\napproximation, and I wish to see what kind of observation you will\r\nmake.\" It was erroneous, as might have been expected; but when I took\r\nthe mean of several observations, it differed but little from that which\r\nSir James South had made; and here I learnt practically the importance\r\nof taking the mean of approximate quantities.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nDr. Wollaston, Dr. Young, and the Katers died before I became an author;\r\nLord Brougham was one of the last of my scientific contemporaries, all\r\nthe rest were younger than myself, and with this younger set, as with\r\ntheir predecessors, we had most agreeable and constant intercourse.\r\nAlthough we lived so much in scientific society we had all along been on\r\nthe most friendly and intimate terms with the literary society of the\r\nday, such as Hallam, Milman, Moore, Malthus, &c., &c. The highly\r\nintellectual conversation of these was enlivened by the brilliant wit of\r\nmy early friend, Sydney Smith, who was loved and admired by every one.\r\nHis daughter married our friend Sir Henry Holland, the distinguished\r\nphysician, well known for his eminent literary and scientific\r\nacquirements as well as for his refined taste.\r\n\r\nNo house in London was more hospitable and agreeable than that of the\r\nlate Mr. John Murray, in Albemarle Street. His dinner parties were\r\nbrilliant, with all the poets and literary characters of the day, and\r\nMr. Murray himself was gentlemanly, full of information, and kept up the\r\nconversation with spirit. He generously published the \"Mechanism of the\r\nHeavens\" at his own risk, which, from its analytical character, could\r\nonly be read by mathematicians.\r\n\r\nBesides those I have mentioned we had a numerous acquaintance who were\r\nneither learned nor scientific; and at concerts at some of their houses\r\nI enjoyed much hearing the great artists of the day, such as Pasta,\r\nMalibran, Grisi, Rubini, &c., &c. We knew Lucien Buonaparte, who gave me\r\na copy of his poems, which were a failure.\r\n\r\nI had become acquainted with Madame de Montalembert, who was an\r\nEnglishwoman, and was mother of the celebrated Comte; she was very\r\neccentric, and at that time was an Ultra-Protestant. One day she came to\r\nask me to go and drive in the Park with her, and afterwards dine at her\r\nhouse, saying, \"We shall all be in high dresses.\" So I accepted, and on\r\nentering the drawing-room, found a bishop and several clergymen, Lady\r\nOlivia Sparrow, and some other ladies, all in high black satin dresses\r\nand white lace caps, precisely the dress I wore, and I thought it a\r\ncurious coincidence. The party was lively enough, and agreeable, but the\r\nconversation was in a style I had never heard before--in fact, it\r\naffected the phraseology of the Bible. We all went after dinner to a\r\nsort of meeting at Exeter Hall, I quite forget for what purpose, but our\r\nparty was on a kind of raised platform. I mentioned this to a friend\r\nafterwards, and the curious circumstance of our all being dressed alike.\r\n\"Do you not know,\" she said, \"that dress is assumed as a distinctive\r\nmark of the Evangelical party! So you were a wolf in sheep's clothing!\"\r\n\r\nI had been acquainted with the Miss Berrys at Raith, when visiting their\r\ncousins, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson. Mary, the eldest, was a handsome,\r\naccomplished woman, who from her youth had lived in the most\r\ndistinguished society, both at home and abroad. She published a\r\n\"Comparative View of Social Life in France and England,\" which was well\r\nreceived by the public. She was a Latin scholar, spoke and wrote French\r\nfluently, yet with all these advantages, the consciousness that she\r\nmight have done something better, had female education been less\r\nfrivolous, gave her a characteristic melancholy which lasted through\r\nlife. She did not talk much herself, but she had the tact to lead\r\nconversation. She and her sister received every evening a select society\r\nin their small house in Curzon Street. Besides any distinguished\r\nforeigners who happened to be in London, among their habitual guests\r\nwere my friend, Lady Charlotte Lindsay, always witty and agreeable, the\r\nbrilliant and beautiful Sheridans, Lady Theresa Lister, afterwards Lady\r\nTheresa Lewis, who edited Miss Berry's \"Memoirs,\" Lord Lansdowne, and\r\nmany others. Lady Davy came occasionally, and the Miss Fanshaws, who\r\nwere highly accomplished, and good artists, besides Miss Catherine\r\nFanshaw wrote clever _vers de société_, such as a charade on the letter\r\nH, and, if I am not mistaken, \"The Butterfly's Ball,\" &c. I visited\r\nthese ladies, but their manners were so cold and formal that, though I\r\nadmired their talents, I never became intimate with them. On the\r\ncontrary, like everyone else, I loved Mary Berry, she was so\r\nwarm-hearted and kind. When London began to fill, and the season was at\r\nits height, the Miss Berrys used to retire to a pretty villa at\r\nTwickenham, where they received their friends to luncheon, and\r\nstrawberries and cream, and very delightful these visits were in fine\r\nspring weather. I recollect once, after dining there, to have been\r\nfortunate enough to give a place in my carriage to Lord Macaulay, and\r\nthose who remember his charming and brilliant conversation will\r\nunderstand how short the drive to London appeared.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes went to see Miss Lydia White, who received every evening;\r\nshe was clever, witty, and very free in her conversation. On one\r\noccasion the party consisted, besides ourselves, of the Misses Berry,\r\nLady Davy; the three poets, Rogers, William Spencer, and Campbell; Sir\r\nJames Macintosh, and Lord Dudley. Rogers, who was a bitter satirist and\r\nhated Lord Dudley, had written the following, epigram:--\r\n\r\n    Ward has no heart, 'tis said; but I deny it.\r\n    He has a heart, and gets his speeches by it.\r\n\r\nI had never heard of this epigram, and on coming away Lord Dudley said,\r\n\"You are going home to sleep and I to work.\" I answered, \"Oh! you are\r\ngoing to prepare your speech for to-morrow.\" My appropriate remark\r\nraised an universal laugh.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. Bowditch, of Boston, U.S., who died in 1838, left among other works\r\na \"Commentary on La Place's Mécanique Céleste\" in four volumes. While\r\nbusily occupied in bringing out an edition of the \"Physical Sciences,\" I\r\nreceived a letter from his son, Mr. H. Bowditch, requesting me to write\r\nan elaborate review of that work, which would be published in Boston\r\nalong with the biography of his father, written by Mr. Young, who sent\r\nme a copy of it. Though highly sensible of the honour, I declined to\r\nundertake so formidable a work, fearing that I should not do justice to\r\nthe memory of so great a man.\r\n\r\nI have always been in communication with some of the most distinguished\r\nmen of the United States. Washington Irving frequently came to see me\r\nwhen he was in London; he was as agreeable in conversation as he was\r\ndistinguished as an author. No one could be more amiable than Admiral\r\nWilkes, of the U.S. navy: he had all the frankness of a sailor. We saw a\r\ngood deal of him when he was in London, and I had a long letter from\r\nhim, giving me an account of his fleet, his plan for circumnavigation,\r\n&c.&c. I never had the good fortune to become personally acquainted with\r\nCaptain Maury, of the U.S. navy, author of that fascinating book, the\r\n\"Physical Geography of the Sea,\" but I am indebted to him for a copy of\r\nthat work, and of his valuable charts. Mr. Dana, who is an honour to his\r\ncountry, sent me copies of his works, to which I have had occasion\r\nfrequently to refer as acknowledged authority on many branches of\r\nnatural history. I should be ungrateful if I did not acknowledge the\r\nkindness I received from the Silliman family, who informed me of any\r\nscientific discovery in the United States, and sent me a copy of their\r\nJournal when it contained anything which might interest me. I was\r\nelected an honorary member of the Geographical and Statistical Society\r\nof New York, U.S. on the 15th May, 1857, and on the 15th October, 1869,\r\nI was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society at\r\nPhiladelphia, for Promoting Useful Knowledge. I shall ever be most\r\ngrateful for these honours.\r\n\r\nWhile living in Florence, many years after, an American friend invited\r\nme to an evening party to meet an American authoress who wished\r\nparticularly to make my acquaintance. I accordingly went there on the\r\nevening in question, and my friends, after receiving me with their\r\naccustomed cordiality, presented me to the lady, and placed me beside\r\nher to give me an opportunity of conversing with her. I addressed her\r\nseveral times, and made various attempts to enter into conversation, but\r\nonly received very dry answers in reply. At last she fairly turned her\r\nback upon me, and became engrossed with a lady who sat on her other\r\nside, upon which I got up and left her and never saw her again. A very\r\ndifferent person in every respect was present that evening, as much\r\ndistinguished by her high mental qualities and poetical genius as by her\r\nmodesty and simplicity. I allude to our greatest British poetess, Mrs.\r\nBrowning, who at that time resided in Florence, except when the delicacy\r\nof her health obliged her to go to Rome. I think there is no other\r\ninstance of husband and wife both poets, and both distinguished in their\r\ndifferent lines. I can imagine no happier or more fascinating life than\r\ntheirs; two kindred spirits united in the highest and noblest\r\naspirations. Unfortunately her life was a short one; in the full bloom\r\nof her intellect her frail health gave way, and she died leaving a noble\r\nrecord of genius to future ages, and a sweet memory to those who were\r\nher contemporaries. The Florentines, who, like all Italians, greatly\r\nappreciate genius, whether native or foreign, have placed a\r\ncommemorative tablet on Casa Guidi, the house Mrs. Browning inhabited.\r\n\r\nI was extremely delighted last spring in being honoured by a visit from\r\nLongfellow, that most genial poet. It is not always the case that the\r\ngeneral appearance of a distinguished person answers to one's ideal of\r\nwhat he ought to be--in this respect Longfellow far surpasses\r\nexpectation. I was as much charmed with his winning manner and\r\nconversation as by his calm, grand features and the expression of his\r\nintellectual countenance.\r\n\r\nThe Barons Fairfax, as I mentioned already, had long been members of\r\nthe Republic of the United States, and Washington's mother belonged to\r\nthis family. During the war of Independence, while my father, then\r\nLieutenant Fairfax, was on board a man-of-war on the American station,\r\nhe received a letter from General Washington claiming him as a relation,\r\nand inviting him to pay him a visit, saying, he did not think that war\r\nshould interfere with the courtesies of private life. Party spirit ran\r\nso high at that time that my father was reprimanded for being in\r\ncorrespondence with the enemy. I mentioned to my friend, the Rev. Dr.\r\nTuckerman, of the United States, how much I regretted that so precious a\r\nletter had been lost, and he most kindly on going home sent me an\r\nautograph letter of General Washington.\r\n\r\n    FROM THE REV. JOSEPH TUCKERMAN TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    BOSTON, _August 28th, 1834_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n    I have very great pleasure in sending to you an autograph letter of\r\n    your and our glorious Washington. I obtained it from Mr. Sparks, who\r\n    had the gratification of seeing you when he was in England, and who\r\n    told me when I applied to him for it, that there is no one in the\r\n    world to whom he would be so glad to give it. It is beyond\r\n    comparison the best and almost the only remaining one at his\r\n    disposal among the \"Washington\" papers.\r\n\r\n    I am again in my family and in the field of my ministry.\r\n\r\n    But very dear to me are my associations with scenes and friends in\r\n    England; and most glad should I be if I could renew that intercourse\r\n    with yourself, and with the intellect and virtue around you, to\r\n    which I have been indebted for great happiness, and which, I hope,\r\n    has done something to qualify me for a more efficient service. Will\r\n    you please to present my very sincere respects to your husband, and\r\n    to recall me to the kind remembrance of your children. With the\r\n    highest respect and regard, allow me to call myself.\r\n\r\n                                               Your friend,\r\n                                                    JOSEPH TUCKERMAN.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI think it must have been on returning from the American station, or may\r\nbe later in the career of my father's life, that a circumstance occurred\r\nwhich distressed him exceedingly. Highway robberies were common on all\r\nthe roads in the vicinity of London, but no violence was offered. My\r\nfather was travelling alone over Blackheath when the postilion was\r\nordered to stop, a pistol presented at my father, and his purse\r\ndemanded. My father at once recognised the voice as that of a shipmate,\r\nand exclaimed, \"Good God! I know that voice! can it be young----? I am\r\ndreadfully shocked; I have a hundred pounds which shall be yours--come\r\ninto the carriage, and let me take you to London, where you will be\r\nsafe.\" ... \"No, no,\" the young man said, \"I have associates whom I\r\ncannot leave--it is too late.\" ... It was too late; he was arrested\r\neventually and suffered. Years afterwards when by some accident my\r\nfather mentioned this event, he was deeply affected, and never would\r\ntell the name of the young man who had been his mess-mate.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: M. Pellegrino Rossi, afterwards Minister of France at\r\nRome, then Prime Minister to Pius the Ninth; murdered in 1848 on the\r\nsteps of the Cancelleria, at Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nROME, NAPLES, AND COMO--BADEN--WINTER AT FLORENCE--SIENA--LETTER FROM\r\nLORD BROUGHAM--MR. MOUNTSTUART ELPHINSTONE--LIFE AT ROME--CAMPAGNA\r\nCATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [My mother was already meditating writing a book upon Physical\r\n    Geography, and had begun to collect materials for it, when my\r\n    father's long and dangerous illness obliged her to lay it aside for\r\n    a time. My father was ordered to a warmer climate for the winter,\r\n    and as soon as he was able to travel we proceeded to Rome. We were\r\n    hardly settled when my mother, with her usual energy, set to work\r\n    diligently, and began this book, which was not published for some\r\n    time later, as it required much thought and research. She never\r\n    allowed anything to interfere with her morning's work; after that\r\n    was over she was delighted to join in any plan which had been formed\r\n    for the afternoon's amusement, and enjoyed herself thoroughly,\r\n    whether in visiting antiquities and galleries, excursions in the\r\n    neighbourhood, or else going with a friend to paint on the Campagna.\r\n    My mother was extremely fond of Rome, and often said no place had\r\n    ever suited her so well. Independently of the picturesque beauty of\r\n    the place, which, to such a lover of nature, was sufficient in\r\n    itself, there was a very pleasant society during many seasons we\r\n    spent there. The visitors were far less numerous than they are now,\r\n    but on that very account there was more sociability and intimacy,\r\n    and scarcely an evening passed without our meeting. The artists\r\n    residing at Rome, too, were a most delightful addition to society.\r\n    Some of them became our very dear friends. My mother remarks:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe took lodgings at Rome, and as soon as we were settled I resumed my\r\nwork and wrote every morning till two o'clock, then went to some\r\ngallery, walked on the Pincio, dined at six, and in the evening either\r\nwent out or received visits at home--the pleasantest way of seeing\r\nfriends, as it does not interfere with one's occupations.\r\n\r\nWe once joined a party that was arranged to see the statues in the\r\nVatican by torchlight, at which Lord Macaulay astonished us by his\r\ncorrect knowledge and learning as we passed through the gallery of\r\ninscriptions. To me this evening was memorable; on this occasion I first\r\nmet with John Gibson, the sculptor, who afterwards became a dear and\r\nvalued friend. He must have been a pupil of Canova's or Thorwaldsen's\r\nwhen Somerville and I were first at Rome. Now his fame was as great as\r\nthat of either of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [In spring we went to Naples for a few weeks, and returned to Rome\r\n    by the San Germano road, now so familiar to travellers, but then\r\n    hardly ever frequented, as it was extremely unsafe on account of the\r\n    brigands. We met with no adventures, although we often reached our\r\n    night quarters long after sunset, for my mother sketched a great\r\n    deal on the road. We travelled by vetturino and continued this\r\n    delightful journey to Como. My mother was a perfect travelling\r\n    companion, always cheerful and contented and interested in all she\r\n    saw. I leave her to tell of our pleasant residence at Bellaggio in\r\n    her own words:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe remained only a short time at Florence, and then went for a month to\r\nBellaggio, on the Lake of Como, at that time the most lonely village\r\nimaginable. We had neither letters, newspapers, nor any books, except\r\nthe Bible, yet we liked it exceedingly. I did nothing but paint in the\r\nmornings, and Somerville sat by me. My daughters wandered about, and in\r\nthe evening we went in a boat on the lake. Sometimes we made longer\r\nexcursions. One day we went early to Menaggio, at the upper end of the\r\nlake. The day had been beautiful, but while at dinner we were startled\r\nby a loud peal of thunder. The boatmen desired us to embark without\r\ndelay, as a storm was rising behind the mountains; it soon blew a gale,\r\nand the lake was a sheet of foam; we took shelter for a while at some\r\nplace on the coast and set out again, thinking the storm had blown over,\r\nbut it was soon worse than ever. We were in no small danger for two\r\nhours. The boatmen, terrified, threw themselves on their knees in prayer\r\nto the Madonna. Somerville seized the helm and lowered the sail and\r\nordered them to rise, saying, the Madonna would help them if they helped\r\nthemselves, and at last they returned to their duty. For a long time we\r\nremained perfectly silent, when one of our daughters said, \"I have been\r\nthinking what a paragraph it will be in the newspapers, 'Drowned, during\r\na sudden squall on the lake of Como, an English family named Somerville,\r\nfather, mother and two daughters.'\" The silence thus broken made us\r\nlaugh, though our situation was serious enough, for when we landed the\r\nshore was crowded with people who had fully expected to see the boat go\r\ndown. Twice after this we were overtaken by these squalls, which are\r\nvery dangerous. I shall never forget the magnificence of the lightning\r\nand the grandeur of the thunder, which was echoed by the mountains\r\nduring the storms on the Lake of Como.\r\n\r\nWe saw the fishermen spear the fish by torchlight, as they did on the\r\nTweed. The fish were plenty and the water so clear that they were seen\r\nat a great depth. There are very large red-fleshed trout in the lake,\r\nand a small very delicious fish called _agoni_, caught in multitudes by\r\nfine silk nets, to which bells are attached on floats, that keep up a\r\nconstant tinkling to let the fishermen know where to find their nets\r\nwhen floated away by the wind.\r\n\r\n    [We now crossed the Alps, by the St. Gothard, to Basle and Baden\r\n    Baden, where we passed the summer, intending to return to England in\r\n    autumn, but as soon as the rains began my father had so serious a\r\n    return of his illness that my mother was much alarmed. When he was\r\n    well enough to travel, we once more crossed the Alps, and reached\r\n    Florence, where we remained for the winter. My mother resumed her\r\n    work there.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of the Grand Duke, I was allowed to have books at\r\nhome from his private library in the Pitti Palace, a favour only granted\r\nto the four Directors. This gave me courage to collect materials for my\r\nlong neglected Physical Geography, still in embryo. As I took an\r\ninterest in every branch of science I became acquainted with Professor\r\nAmici, whose microscopes were unrivalled at that time, and as he had\r\nmade many remarkable microscopic discoveries in natural history, he took\r\nus to the Museum to see them magnified and modelled in wax. I had the\r\nhonour of being elected a member of the Academy of Natural Science at\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nThere were many agreeable people at Florence that winter and a good deal\r\nof gaiety. The Marchese Antinori presented Somerville and me to the\r\nGrand Duke, who had expressed a wish to know me. He received us very\r\ngraciously, and conversed with us for more than an hour on general\r\nsubjects. He afterwards wrote me a polite letter, accompanied by a work\r\non the drainage of the Maremma, and gave directions about our being\r\ninvited to a scientific meeting which was to be held at Pisa. We were\r\npresented to the Grand Duchess, who was very civil. We spent the summer\r\nat Siena, and had a cheerful airy apartment with a fine view of the\r\nhills of Santa Fiora, and with very pretty arabesques in fresco on the\r\nwalls of all the rooms, some so very artistic that I made sketches of\r\nthem. In these old cities many of the palaces and houses are decorated\r\nwith that artistic taste which formerly prevailed to such an extent in\r\nItaly, and, which has now yielded, here as elsewhere, to commonplace\r\nmodern furniture.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [While we were at Siena, my mother received the following letter\r\n    from Lord Brougham, who was a frequent correspondent of hers, but\r\n    whose letters are generally too exclusively mathematical for the\r\n    general reader. My mother had described the curious horse-races\r\n    which are held at Siena every three years, and other mediæval\r\n    customs still prevalent.]\r\n\r\n    FROM LORD BROUGHAM TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    COLE HILL, KENT, _Sept. 28th, 1840_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I am much obliged to you for your kind letter which let me know of\r\n    your movements. I had not heard of them since I saw the\r\n    Fergusons.... We have been here since parliament rose, as I am not\r\n    yet at all equal to going to Brougham. My health is now quite\r\n    restored; but I shall not soon--nor in all probability ever--recover\r\n    the losses I have been afflicted with. I passed the greater part of\r\n    last winter in Provence, expecting some relief from change of scene\r\n    and from the fine climate; but I came back fully worse than when I\r\n    went. In fact, I did wrong in struggling at first, which I did to be\r\n    able to meet parliament in January last. If I had yielded at once, I\r\n    would have been better. I hope and trust they sent you a book I\r\n    published two years ago; I mean the \"Dissertations,\" of which one is\r\n    on the \"Principia,\" and designed to try how far it may be taught to\r\n    persons having but a very moderate stock of mathematics; also, if\r\n    possible, to keep alive the _true taste_ (as I reckon it) in\r\n    mathematics, which modern analysis has a little broken in upon.\r\n    Assuming you to have got the book, I must mention that there are\r\n    some intolerable errors of the press left, such as.... Excuse my\r\n    troubling you with these errata, and impute it to my wish that you\r\n    should not suppose me to have written the nonsense which these pages\r\n    seem to prove. By the way, it is a curious proof of university\r\n    prejudice, that though the Cambridge men admit my analysis of the\r\n    \"Principia\" to be unexceptionable, and to be well calculated for\r\n    teaching the work, yet, _not being by a Cambridge man_, it cannot be\r\n    used! They are far more liberal at Paris, where they only are\r\n    waiting for my analysis of the second book; but I put off finishing\r\n    it, as I do still more my account of the \"Mécanique Céleste.\" The\r\n    latter I have almost abandoned in despair after nearly finishing it;\r\n    I find so much that cannot be explained elementarily, or anything\r\n    near it. So that my account to be complete would be nearly as hard\r\n    reading as yours, and not 1000th part as good.... I greatly envy you\r\n    Siena; I never was there above a day, and always desired to stay\r\n    longer. The language is, as you say, a real charm; but I was not\r\n    aware of the preservation in which you describe the older manners to\r\n    be. I fear I shall not be able to visit Provence, as I should have\r\n    wished this winter ... but my plans are not quite fixed. The\r\n    judicial business in Parliament and the Privy Council will also make\r\n    my going abroad after January difficult. I don't write you any news,\r\n    nor is there any but what you see in the papers. The Tory\r\n    restoration approaches very steadily, tho' not very rapidly; and I\r\n    only hope that the Whigs, having contrived to destroy the Liberal\r\n    party in the country--I fear past all hope of recovery--may not have\r\n    a war abroad also to mourn for....\r\n\r\n                                               Believe me,\r\n                                                    Yours ever,\r\n                                                         H. BROUGHAM.\r\n\r\nOn going to Rome I required a good many books for continuing my work on\r\n\"Physical Geography,\" and had got \"Transactions of the Geographical\r\nSociety\" and other works sent from London, The Hon. Mountstuart\r\nElphinstone who was then at Rome, was an old acquaintance of ours. He\r\nwas one of the most amiable men I ever met with, and quite won my heart\r\none day at table when they were talking of the number of singing-birds\r\nthat were eaten in Italy--nightingales, goldfinches, and robins--he\r\ncalled out, \"What! robins! our household birds! I would as soon eat a\r\nchild!\" He was so kind as to write to the Directors of the East India\r\nCompany requesting that I might have the use of the library and papers\r\nthat were in the India House. This was readily granted me; and I had a\r\nletter in consequence from Mr. Wilson, the Orientalist, giving me a list\r\nof the works they had on the geography of Eastern Asia and the most\r\nrecent travels in the Himalaya, Thibet, and China, with much useful\r\ninformation from himself. I was indebted to Sir Henry Pottinger, then at\r\nRome, for information relating to Scinde, for he had been for some years\r\nBritish Envoy at Beloochistan. Thus provided, I went on with my work. We\r\nlived several winters in an apartment on the second floor of Palazzo\r\nLepri, Via dei Condotti, where we passed many happy days. When we first\r\nlived in Via Condotti, the waste-pipes to carry off the rain-water from\r\nthe roofs projected far into the street, and when there was a violent\r\nthunderstorm, one might have thought a waterspout had broken over Rome,\r\nthe water poured in such cascades from the houses on each side of the\r\nstreet. On one occasion the rain continued in torrents for thirty-six\r\nhours, and the Tiber came down in heavy flood, inundating the Ghetto and\r\nall the low parts of the city; the water was six feet deep in the\r\nPantheon. The people were driven out of their houses in the middle of\r\nthe night and took refuge in the churches, and boats plied in the\r\nstreets supplying the inhabitants with food, which they hauled up in\r\nbaskets let down from the windows. The Campagna for miles was under\r\nwater; it covered the Ponte Molle so that the courier could not pass;\r\nand seen from the Pincio it looked like an extensive lake. Much anxiety\r\nwas felt for the people who lived in the farm houses now surrounded with\r\nwater. Boats were sent to rescue them, and few lives were lost; but many\r\nanimals perished. The flood did not subside till after three days, when\r\nit left everything covered with yellow mud; the loss of property was\r\nvery great, and there was much misery for a long time.\r\n\r\nOur house was in a very central position, and when not engaged I gladly\r\nreceived anyone who liked to come to us in the evening, and we had a\r\nmost agreeable society, foreign and English, for we were not looked upon\r\nas strangers, and the English society was much better during the years\r\nwe spent in Rome than it was afterwards.\r\n\r\nI had an annual visit of an hour from the astronomer Padre Vico, and\r\nPadre Pianciani, Professor of Chemistry in the Collegio Romano. I was\r\ninvited to see the Observatory; but as I had seen those of Greenwich and\r\nParis, I did not think it worth while accepting the invitation,\r\nespecially as it required an order from the Pope. I could easily have\r\nobtained leave, for we were presented to Gregory XVI. by the President\r\nof the Scotch Catholic College. The Pope received me with marked\r\ndistinction; notwithstanding I was disgusted to see the President\r\nprostrate on the floor, kissing the Pope's foot as if he had been\r\ndivine. I think it was about this time that I was elected an honorary\r\nassociate of the Accademia Tiberiana.\r\n\r\nI had very great delight in the Campagna of Rome; the fine range of\r\nApennines bounding the plain, over which the fleeting shadows of the\r\npassing clouds fell, ever changing and always beautiful, whether viewed\r\nin the early morning, or in the glory of the setting sun, I was never\r\ntired of admiring; and whenever I drove out, preferred a country drive\r\nto the more fashionable Villa Borghese. One day Somerville and I and our\r\ndaughters went to drive towards the Tavolata, on the road to Albano. We\r\ngot out of the carriage, and went into a field, tempted by the wild\r\nflowers. On one side of this field ran the aqueduct, on the other a deep\r\nand wide ditch full of water. I had gone towards the aqueduct, leaving\r\nthe others in the field. All at once we heard a loud shouting, when an\r\nenormous drove of the beautiful Campagna grey cattle with their\r\nwide-spreading horns came rushing wildly between us with their heads\r\ndown and their tails erect, driven by men with long spears mounted on\r\nlittle spirited horses at full gallop. It was so sudden and so rapid,\r\nthat only after it was over did we perceive the danger we had run. As\r\nthere was no possible escape, there was nothing for it but standing\r\nstill, which Somerville and my girls had presence of mind to do, and the\r\ndrove dividing, rushed like a whirlwind to the right and left of them.\r\nThe danger was not so much of being gored as of being run over by the\r\nexcited and terrified animals, and round the walls of Rome places of\r\nrefuge are provided for those who may be passing when the cattle are\r\ndriven. Near where this occurred there is a house with the inscription\r\n\"_Casa Dei Spiriti_\"; but I do not think the Italians believe in either\r\nghosts or witches; their chief superstition seems to be the\r\n\"_Jettatura_\" or evil eye, which they have inherited from the early\r\nRomans, and, I believe, Etruscans. They consider it a bad omen to meet a\r\nmonk or priest on first going out in the morning. My daughters were\r\nengaged to ride with a large party, and the meet was at our house. A\r\nRoman, who happened to go out first, saw a friar, and rushed in again\r\nlaughing, and waited till he was out of sight. Soon after they set off,\r\nthis gentleman was thrown from his horse and ducked in a pool; so the\r\n\"_Jettatura_\" was fulfilled. But my daughters thought his bad seat on\r\nhorseback enough to account for his fall without the Evil Eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nALBANO--POPULAR SINGING--LETTERS FROM MRS.\r\nSOMERVILLE--GIBSON--PERUGIA--COMET OF 1843--SUMMER AT VENICE--LETTERS\r\nFROM MRS. SOMERVILLE AND MISS JOANNA BAILLIE--ELECTED ASSOCIATE OF THE\r\nCOLLEGE OF RESURGENTI AND R.I. ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AT AREZZO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spring we went to Albano, and lived in a villa, high up on the hill\r\nin a beautiful situation not far from the lake. The view was most\r\nextensive, commanding the whole of the Campagna as far as Terracina, &c.\r\nIn this wide expanse we could see the thunderclouds forming and rising\r\ngradually over the sky before the storm, and I used to watch the vapour\r\ncondensing into a cloud as it rose into the cool air. I never witnessed\r\nanything so violent as the storms we had about the equinox, when the\r\nweather broke up. Our house being high above the plain became enveloped\r\nin vapour till, at 3 p.m. we could scarcely see the olives which grew\r\nbelow our windows, and crash followed crash with no interval between the\r\nlightning and the thunder, so that we felt sure many places must have\r\nbeen struck; and we were not mistaken--trees, houses, and even cattle\r\nhad been struck close to us. Somerville went to Florence to attend a\r\nscientific meeting, and wrote to us that the lightning there had\r\nstripped the gold leaf off the conductors on the powder magazine; a\r\nproof of their utility.\r\n\r\nThe sunsets were glorious, and I, fascinated by the gorgeous colouring,\r\nattempted to paint what Turner alone could have done justice to. I made\r\nstudies, too, which were signal failures, of the noble ilex trees\r\nbordering the lake of Albano. Thus I wasted a great deal of time, I can\r\nhardly say in vain, from the pleasure I had in the lovely scenery.\r\nSomerville sat often by me with his book, while I painted from nature,\r\nor amused himself examining the geological structure of the country. Our\r\nlife was a solitary one, except for the occasional visit from some\r\nfriends who were at Frascati; but we never found it dull; besides, we\r\nmade many expeditions on mules or donkeys to places in the\r\nneighbourhood. I was very much delighted with the flora on the Campagna\r\nand the Alban hills, which in spring and early summer are a perfect\r\ngarden of flowers. Many plants we cultivate in England here grow wild in\r\nprofusion, such as cyclamens, gum-cistus, both white and purple, many\r\nrare and beautiful orchideæ, the large flowering Spanish broom,\r\nperfuming the air all around, the tall, white-blossomed Mediterranean\r\nheath, and the myrtle. These and many others my girls used to bring in\r\nfrom their early morning walks. The flowers only lasted till the end of\r\nJune, when the heat began, and the whole country became brown and\r\nparched; but scarcely had the autumnal rains commenced, when, like\r\nmagic, the whole country broke out once more into verdure, and myriads\r\nof cyclamens covered the ground. Nightingales abounded in the woods,\r\nsinging both by night and by day; and one bright moonlight night my\r\ndaughters, who slept with their window open, were startled from their\r\nsleep by the hooting of one of those beautiful birds, the great-eared\r\nowl--\"le grand duc\" of Buffon--which had settled on the railing of their\r\nbalcony. We constantly came across snakes, generally harmless ones; but\r\nthere were a good many vipers, and once, when Somerville and my\r\ndaughters, with Mr. Cromek, the artist, had gone from Genzano to Nettuno\r\nfor a couple of days, a small asp which was crawling among the\r\nbent-grass on the seashore, darted at one of the girls, who had\r\nirritated it by touching it with her parasol. By the natives they are\r\nmuch dreaded, both on this coast and in the pine forest of Ravenna,\r\nwhere the cattle are said to be occasionally poisoned by their bite.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe had been acquainted with the Rev. Dr., afterwards Cardinal Wiseman at\r\nRome. He was head of a college of young men educating for the Catholic\r\nChurch, who had their \"villeggiatura\" at Monte Porzio. We spent a day\r\nwith him there, and visited Tusculum; another day we went to Lariccia,\r\nwhere there is a palace and park belonging to the Chigi family in a most\r\npicturesque but dilapidated state. We went also to Ganzano, Rocca del\r\nPapa, and occasionally to visit frends at Frascati. There was a stone\r\nthreshing-floor behind our house. During the vintage we had it nicely\r\nswept and lighted with torches, and the grape gatherers came and danced\r\ntill long after midnight, to the great amusement of my daughters, who\r\njoined in the dance, which was the Saltarello, a variety of the\r\nTarantella. They danced to the beating of tambourines. Italy is the\r\ncountry of music, especially of melody, and the popular airs, especially\r\nthe Neapolitan, are extremely beautiful and melodious; yet it is a fact,\r\nthat the singing of the peasantry, particularly in the Roman and\r\nNeapolitan provinces, is most disagreeable and discordant. It is not\r\nmelody at all, but a kind of wild chant, meandering through minor tones,\r\nwithout rhythm of any sort or apparent rule, and my daughters say it is\r\nvery difficult to note down; yet there is some kind of method and\r\nsimilarity in it as one hears it shouted out at the loudest pitch of the\r\nvoice, the last note dwelt upon and drawn out to an immeasurable length.\r\nThe words are frequently improvised by the singers, who answer one\r\nanother from a distance, as they work in the fields. I have been told\r\nthis style of chanting--singing it can hardly be called--has been handed\r\ndown from the most ancient times, and it is said, in the southern\r\nprovinces, to have descended from the early Greek colonists. The ancient\r\nGreeks are supposed to have chanted their poetry to music, as do the\r\nItalian improvisatori at the present day. In Tuscany, the words of the\r\nsongs are often extremely poetical and graceful. Frequently, these\r\nverses, called \"stornelli\" and \"rispetti,\" are composed by the peasants\r\nthemselves, women as well as men; the language is the purest and most\r\nclassical Italian, such as is spoken at the present day in the provinces\r\nof Siena, Pistoja, &c., very much less corrupted by foreign idioms or\r\nadaptations than what is spoken, even by cultivated persons, in Florence\r\nitself. The picturesque costumes so universal when I first came to\r\nItaly, in 1817, had fallen very much into disuse when, at a much later\r\nperiod, we resided in Rome, and now they are rarely seen.\r\n\r\nWe hired a handsome peasant girl from Albano as housemaid, who was much\r\nadmired by our English friends in her scarlet cloth bodice, trimmed with\r\ngold lace, and the silver spadone, or bodkin, fastening her plaits of\r\ndark hair; but she very soon exchanged her picturesque costume for a\r\nbonnet, etc., in which she looked clumsy and commonplace.\r\n\r\n    [The following are extracts from letters written from Albano by my\r\n    mother:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO HER SON W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    ALBANO, _16th June, 1841_.\r\n\r\n    I was thankful to hear, my dearest Woronzow, from your last letter\r\n    that Agnes is recovering so well.... We are very much pleased with\r\n    our residence at Albano; the house, with its high sounding name of\r\n    \"Villa,\" is more like a farmhouse, with brick floors and no carpets,\r\n    and a few chairs and tables, but the situation is divine. We are\r\n    near the top of the hill, about half-a-mile above Albano, and have\r\n    the most magnificent view in every direction, and such a variety of\r\n    delightful walks, that we take a new one every evening. For painting\r\n    it is perfect; every step is a picture. At present we have no one\r\n    near, and lead the life of hermits; but our friends have loaded us\r\n    with books, and with drawing, painting, music, and writing, we never\r\n    have a moment idle. Almost every one has left Rome; but the English\r\n    have all gone elsewhere, as they are not so easily pleased with a\r\n    house as we are. The only gay thing we have done was a donkey ride\r\n    yesterday to the top of Monte Cavo, and back by the lake of Nemi....\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO WORONZOW GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    ALBANO, _20th August, 1841_.\r\n\r\n    I dare say you think it very long since you have heard from me, my\r\n    dearest Woronzow, but the truth is, I have been writing so hard,\r\n    that after I had finished my day's work, I was fit for nothing but\r\n    idleness. The reason of my hurry is, that the scientific meeting\r\n    takes place at Florence on the 15th of September, and as I think it\r\n    probable that some of our English philosophers will come to it, I\r\n    hope to have a safe opportunity of sending home some MS. which it\r\n    has cost me hard work to get ready, as I have undertaken a book more\r\n    fit for the combination of a Society than for a single hand to\r\n    accomplish. Lord Brougham was most kind when at Rome, and took so\r\n    great an interest in it, that he has, undertaken to read it over,\r\n    and give me his opinion and criticism, which will be very valuable,\r\n    as I know no one who is a better judge of these matters. He will\r\n    send it to Mr. Murray, and you had better consult with him about it,\r\n    whether he thinks it will succeed or not. Both William and Martha\r\n    like what I have done; but I am very nervous about it, and wish you\r\n    would read it if you have time.... We have been extremely quiet all\r\n    the summer; we have no neighbours, so that we amuse ourselves with\r\n    our occupations. I get up between six and seven, breakfast at eight,\r\n    and write till three, when we dine; after dinner, I write again till\r\n    near six, when we go out and take a long walk; come home to tea at\r\n    nine, and go to bed at eleven: the same thing day after day, so you\r\n    cannot expect a very amusing letter.... I have another commission I\r\n    wish you would do for me; it is to inquire what discoveries Captain\r\n    Ross has made at the South Pole. I saw a very interesting account in\r\n    \"Galignani\" of what they have done, but cannot trust to a newspaper\r\n    account so as to quote it.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA new edition of my \"Physical Sciences\" was required, so the \"Physical\r\nGeography\" was laid aside for the present. On returning to Rome, we\r\nresumed our usual life, and continued to receive our friends in the\r\nevening without ceremony. There was generally a merry party round the\r\ntea table in a corner of the room. I cannot omit mentioning one of the\r\nmost charming and intellectual of our friends, Don Michelangelo Gaetani,\r\nDuke of Sermoneta, whose brilliant and witty conversation is unrivalled,\r\nand for whom I have had a very sincere friendship for many years. I\r\nfound him lately as charming as ever, notwithstanding the cruel loss of\r\nhis sight. The last time I ever dined out was at his house at Rome, when\r\nI was on my way to Naples in 1867.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nJohn Gibson, the sculptor, the most guileless and amiable of men, was\r\nnow a dear friend. His style was the purest Grecian, and had some of\r\nhis works been found among the ruins, multitudes would have come to Rome\r\nto admire them. He was now in the height of his fame; yet he was so kind\r\nand encouraging to young people that he allowed my girls to go and draw\r\nin his studio, and one of my daughters, with a friend, modelled there\r\nfor some time. His drawings for bas-reliefs were most beautiful. He drew\r\nvery slowly, but a line once drawn was never changed. He ignored\r\nIndia-rubber or bread-crumbs, so perfect was his knowledge of anatomy,\r\nand so decided the character and expression he meant to give.\r\n\r\nWe had charades one evening in a small theatre in our house, which went\r\noff very well There was much beauty at Rome at that time; no one who was\r\nthere can have forgotten the beautiful and brilliant Sheridans. I\r\nrecollect Lady Dufferin at the Easter ceremonies at St. Peter's, in her\r\nwidow's cap, with a large black crape veil thrown over it, creating\r\nquite a sensation. With her exquisite features, oval face, and somewhat\r\nfantastical head-dress, anything more lovely could not be conceived; and\r\nthe Roman people crowded round her in undisguised admiration of \"la\r\nbella monaca Inglese.\" Her charm of manner and her brilliant\r\nconversation will never be forgotten by those who knew her. To my mind,\r\nMrs. Norton was the most beautiful of the three sisters. Hers is a\r\ngrand countenance, such as artists love to study. Gibson, whom I asked,\r\nafter his return from England, which he had revisited after twenty-seven\r\nyears' absence, what he thought of Englishwomen, replied, he had seen\r\nmany handsome women, but no such sculptural beauty as Mrs. Norton's. I\r\nmight add the Marchioness of Waterford, whose bust at Macdonald's I took\r\nat first for an ideal head, till I recognised the likeness.\r\n\r\nLady Davy used to live a great deal at Rome, and took an active part in\r\nsociety. She talked a great deal, and talked well when she spoke\r\nEnglish, but like many of us had more pretension with regard to the\r\nthings she could not do well than to those she really could. She was a\r\nLatin scholar, and as far as reading and knowing the literature of\r\nmodern languages went she was very accomplished, but unfortunately, she\r\nfancied she spoke them perfectly, and was never happier than when she\r\nhad people of different nations dining with her, each of whom she\r\naddressed in his own language. Many amusing mistakes of hers in speaking\r\nItalian were current in both Roman and English circles.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA few months were very pleasantly spent one summer at Perugia, where\r\nthere is so much that is interesting to be seen. The neighbouring\r\ncountry is very beautiful, and the city being on the top of a hill is\r\nvery cool during the hot weather. We had an apartment in the Casa\r\nOddi-Baglioni--a name well known in Italian history--and I recollect\r\nspending some very pleasant days with the Conte Oddi-Baglioni, at a\r\nvilla called Colle del Cardinale, some ten or twelve miles from the\r\ntown. The house was large and handsomely decorated, with a profusion of\r\nthe finest Chinese vases. On our toilet tables were placed perfumes,\r\nscented soap, and very elaborately embroidered nightdresses were laid\r\nout for use. I remember especially admiring the basins, jugs, &c., which\r\nwere all of the finest japan enamel. There was a subterranean apartment\r\nwhere we dined, which was delightfully cool and pleasant, and at a large\r\nand profusely served dinner-table, while we and the guests with the\r\nowner of the house dined at the upper end, at the lower end and below\r\nthe salt there were the superintendent of the Count's farms, a house\r\ndecorator and others of that rank. It is not the only instance we met\r\nwith of this very ancient custom. The first time Somerville and I came\r\nto Italy, years before this, while dining at a very noble house, the\r\nwetnurse took her place, as a matter of course, at the foot of the\r\ndinner-table.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after our arrival and at a very early hour there was a\r\nvery fine eclipse of the sun, though not total at Perugia or the\r\nneighbourhood; the chill and unnatural gloom were very striking.\r\n\r\nPerugia is one of the places in which the ancient athletic game of\r\n_pallone_ is played with spirit. It is so graceful when well played that\r\nI wonder our active young men have not adopted it. A large leather ball\r\nfilled with condensed air is struck and returned again by the opponent\r\nwith the whole force of their right arms, covered to the elbow with a\r\nspiked wooden case. The promptness and activity required to keep up the\r\nball is very great, and the impetus with which it strikes is such, that\r\nthe boxes for spectators in the amphitheatres dedicated to this game are\r\nprotected by strong netting. It is a very complicated game, and, I am\r\ntold, somewhat resembles tennis.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn leaving Perugia we went for a few days to Asissi, spent a day at\r\nChiusi, and then returned to Rome, which we found in a great state of\r\nexcitement on account of three steamers which had just arrived from\r\nEngland to ply on the Tiber. The Pope and Cardinals made a solemn\r\nprocession to bless them. No doubt they would have thought our method of\r\ndashing a bottle of wine on a vessel on naming her highly profane.\r\n\r\nWe constantly made expeditions to the country, to Tivoli, Veii, Ostia,\r\n&c., and my daughters rode on the Campagna. One day they rode to Albano,\r\nand on returning after dark they told me they had seen a most curious\r\ncloud which never altered its position; it was a very long narrow stripe\r\nreaching from the horizon till nearly over head--it was the tail of the\r\nmagnificent comet of 1843.\r\n\r\nWe met with a great temptation in an invitation from Lady Stratford\r\nCanning, to go and visit them at Buyukdéré, near Constantinople, but\r\n_res arcta_ prevented us from accepting what would have been so\r\ndesirable in every respect. At this time I sat to our good friend Mr.\r\nMacdonald for my bust, which was much liked.[13]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOne early summer we went to Loreto and Ancona, where we embarked for\r\nTrieste; the weather seemed fine when we set off, but a storm came on,\r\nwith thunder and lightning, very high sea and several waterspouts. The\r\nvessel rolled and pitched, and we were carried far out of our course to\r\nthe Dalmatian coast. I was obliged to remain a couple of days at Trieste\r\nto rest, and was very glad when we arrived at Venice. The summer passed\r\nmost delightfully at Venice, and we had ample time to see everything\r\nwithout hurry. I wrote very little this summer, for the scenery was so\r\nbeautiful that I painted all day; my daughters drew in the Belle Arti,\r\nand Somerville had plenty of books to amuse him, besides sight-seeing,\r\nwhich occupied much of our time. In the Armenian convent we met with\r\nJoseph Warten, an excellent mathematician and astronomer; he was pastor\r\nat Neusatz, near Peterwardein in Hungary, and he was making a tour\r\nthrough Europe. He asked me to give him a copy of the \"Mechanism of the\r\nHeavens,\" and afterwards wrote in Latin to Somerville and sent me some\r\nerrors of the press he had met with in my book, but they were of no use,\r\nas I never published a second edition. We returned to Rome by Ravenna,\r\nwhere we stayed a couple of days, then travelled slowly along the\r\nAdriatic Coast From thence we went by Gubbio and Perugia to Orvieto, one\r\nof the most interesting towns in Italy, and one seldom visited at that\r\ntime; now the railway will bring it into the regular track of\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [A few extracts from letters, written and received during this\r\n    summer by my mother, may not be without interest. Also parts of two\r\n    from my mother's old and valued friend Miss Joanna Baillie. The\r\n    second letter was written several years later, and is nearly the\r\n    last she ever wrote to my mother.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO WORONZOW GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    VENICE, _21st July, 1843_.\r\n\r\n    I most sincerely rejoice to hear that Agnes and you have gone to the\r\n    Rhine, as I am confident a little change of air and scene will be of\r\n    the greatest service to you both.... We are quite enchanted with\r\n    Venice; no one can form an idea of its infinite loveliness who has\r\n    not seen it in summer and in moonlight. I often doubt my senses, and\r\n    almost fear it may be a dream. We are lodged to perfection, the\r\n    weather has been charming, no oppressive heat, though the\r\n    thermometer ranges from 75° to 80°, accompanied by a good deal of\r\n    scirocco; there are neither flies nor fleas, and as yet the\r\n    mosquitoes have not molested us. We owe much of our comfort to the\r\n    house we are in, for there are scarcely any furnished lodgings, and\r\n    the hotels are bad and dear, besides situation is everything at this\r\n    season, when the smaller canals become offensive at low water, for,\r\n    though there is little tide in the Mediterranean, there are four\r\n    feet at new and full moon here, which is a great blessing. We have\r\n    now seen everything, and have become acquainted with everybody, and\r\n    met with kindness and attention beyond all description. Many of the\r\n    great ducal families still exist, and live handsomely in their\r\n    splendid palaces; indeed, the decay of Venice, so much talked of, is\r\n    quite a mistake; certainly it is very different from what it was in\r\n    its palmy days, but there is a good deal of activity and trade. The\r\n    abolition of the law of primogeniture has injured the noble\r\n    families more than anything else. We rise early, and are busy\r\n    indoors all morning, except the girls, who go to the Academy of the\r\n    _Belle Arti_, and paint from ten till three. We dine at four, and\r\n    embark in our gondola at six or seven, and row about on the glassy\r\n    sea till nine, when we go to the Piazza of San Marco, listen to a\r\n    very fine military band, and sit gossiping till eleven or twelve,\r\n    and then row home by the Grand Canal, or make a visit in one of the\r\n    various houses that are open to us. One of the most remarkable of\r\n    these is that of the Countess Mocenigo's, who has in one of her\r\n    drawing-rooms the portraits of six doges of the Mocenigo name. I was\r\n    presented by her to the Duc de Bordeaux, the other evening, a fat\r\n    good-natured looking person. I was presented also to the Archduke--I\r\n    forget what--son of the Archduke Charles, and admiral of the fleet\r\n    here; a nice youth, but not clever. We meet him everywhere, and\r\n    Somerville dined with him a few days ago. The only strangers of note\r\n    are the Prince of Tour and Taxis, and Marshal Marmont. The Venetian\r\n    ladies are very ladylike and agreeable, and speak beautifully. We\r\n    have received uncommon kindness from Mr. Rawdon Brown; he has made\r\n    us acquainted with everybody, as he is quite at home here, having\r\n    been settled in Venice for several years, and has got a most\r\n    beautiful house fitted up, in _rococo_ style, with great taste; he\r\n    is an adept at Venetian history. He supplies us with books, which\r\n    are a great comfort.... The other evening we were surprised by a\r\n    perfect fleet of gondolas stopping under our windows, from one of\r\n    which we had the most beautiful serenade; the moonlight was like\r\n    day, and the effect was admirable. There was a _festa_ the other\r\n    night in a church on the water's edge; the shore was illuminated\r\n    and hundreds of gondolas were darting along like swallows, the\r\n    gondoliers rowing as if they had been mad, till the water was as\r\n    much agitated as if there had been a gale of wind: nothing could be\r\n    more animated. You will perceive from what I have said that the\r\n    evening, till a late hour, is the time for amusement, in consequence\r\n    of which I follow the Italian custom of sleeping after dinner, and\r\n    am much the better for it. This place agrees particularly well with\r\n    all of us, and is well suited for old people, who require air\r\n    without fatigue....\r\n\r\n                                        Most affectionately,\r\n                                                  MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO WORONZOW GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    VENICE, _27th August, 1843_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR WORONZOW,\r\n\r\n    Your excellent letter, giving an account of your agreeable\r\n    expedition up the Rhine, did not arrive till nearly a month after it\r\n    was written.... I regret exceedingly you could not stay longer, and\r\n    still more that you could not come on and pay us a visit, and enjoy\r\n    the charm of summer in Venice, so totally unlike every other place\r\n    in every respect. I wished for you last night particularly. As we\r\n    were leaving the Piazza San Marco, about eleven, a boat came up,\r\n    burning blue lights, with a piano, violins, flutes, and about twenty\r\n    men on board, who sang choruses in the most delightful manner, and\r\n    sometimes solos. They were followed by an immense number of\r\n    gondolas, and we joined the _cortège_, and all went under the Bridge\r\n    of Sighs, where the effect was beautiful beyond description. We then\r\n    all turned and entered the Grand Canal, which was entirely filled\r\n    with gondolas from one side to the other, jammed together, so that\r\n    we moved _en masse_, and stopped every now and then to burn blue or\r\n    red Bengal lights before the principal palaces, singing going on all\r\n    the while. We saw numbers of our Venetian friends in their gondolas,\r\n    enjoying the scene as much as we did, to whom it was almost new. I\r\n    never saw people who enjoyed life more, and they have much the\r\n    advantage of us in their delicious climate and aquatic amusements,\r\n    so much more picturesque than what can be done on land. However, we\r\n    have had no less than three dances lately. The Grand Duke of Modena,\r\n    with his son and daughter-in-law, were here, and to them a _fête_\r\n    was given by the Countess de Thurn. The palace was brilliant with\r\n    lights; it is on the grand canal, and immediately under the balcony\r\n    was a boat from which fireworks were let off, and then a couple of\r\n    boats succeeded them, in which choruses were sung. The view from the\r\n    balcony is one of the finest in Venice, and the night was charming,\r\n    and there I was while the dancing went on.... I never saw Somerville\r\n    so well; this place suits us to the life, constant air and no\r\n    fatigue; I never once have had a headache.... Now, my dear W., tell\r\n    me your tale; my tale is done.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                  MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO WORONZOW GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    ROME, PALAZZO LEPRI, VIA DEI CONDOTTI, _27th October, 1848_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST WORONZOW,\r\n\r\n    ... We had a beautiful journey to Rome, with fine weather and no\r\n    annoyance, notwithstanding the disturbed state of the country. At\r\n    Padua we only remained long enough to see the churches, and it was\r\n    impossible to pass within a few miles of Arquà without paying a\r\n    visit to the house of Petrarch. At Ferrara we had a letter to the\r\n    Cardinal Legate, who was very civil. His palace is the ancient abode\r\n    of the house of Este.... We had a long visit from him in the\r\n    evening, and found him most agreeable; he regretted that there was\r\n    no opera, as he would have been happy to offer us his box. Fourteen\r\n    of those unfortunate men who have been making an attempt to raise an\r\n    insurrection were arrested the day before; and the night before we\r\n    slept at Lugo, the Carabineers had searched the inn during the\r\n    night, entering the rooms where the people were sleeping. We should\r\n    have been more than surprised to have been wakened by armed men at\r\n    midnight. In travelling through Italy the _reliques_ and history of\r\n    the early Christians and of the Middle Ages have a greater\r\n    attraction for me than those of either the Romans or Etruscans,\r\n    interesting though these latter be, and in this journey my taste was\r\n    amply gratified, especially at Ravenna, where the church of San\r\n    Vitale and the Basilica of St. Apollinare in Classis, both built\r\n    early in the 6th century, are the most magnificent specimens\r\n    imaginable. Here also is the tomb of Theodore, a most wonderful\r\n    building; the remains of his palace and numberless other objects of\r\n    interest, too tedious to mention. Every church is full of them, and\r\n    most valuable MSS. abound in the libraries. I like the history of\r\n    the Middle Ages, because one feels that there is something in common\r\n    between them and us; their names still exist in their descendants,\r\n    who often inhabit the very palaces they dwelt in, and their very\r\n    portraits, by the great masters, still hang in their halls; whereas\r\n    we know nothing about the Greeks and Romans except their public\r\n    deeds--their private life is a blank to us. Our journey through the\r\n    Apennines was most beautiful, passing for days under the shade of\r\n    magnificent oak forests or valleys rich in wine, oil, grain, and\r\n    silk. We deviated from the main road for a short distance to Gubbio,\r\n    to see the celebrated Eugubian tables, which are as sharp as if they\r\n    had been engraved yesterday, but in a lost language. We stopped to\r\n    rest at Perugia, but all our friends were at their country seats,\r\n    which we regretted. The country round Perugia is unrivalled for\r\n    richness and beauty, but it rained the morning we resumed our\r\n    journey. It signified the less as we had been previously at Città\r\n    della Pieve and Chiusi; so we proceeded to Orvieto in fine weather,\r\n    still through oak forests. Orvieto is situated on the top of an\r\n    escarped hill, very like the hill forts of India, and apparently as\r\n    inaccessible; yet, by dint of numberless turns and windings, we did\r\n    get up, but only in time for bed. Next morning we saw the sun rise\r\n    on the most glorious cathedral. After all we had seen we were\r\n    completely taken by surprise, and were filled with the highest\r\n    admiration at the extreme beauty and fine taste of this remarkable\r\n    building....\r\n\r\n                                        Your affectionate mother,\r\n                                                  MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MISS JOANNA BAILLIE TO MRS. SOMERVILLE\r\n\r\n    HAMPSTEAD, _December 27th, 1843_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    Besides being proud of receiving a letter from you, I was much\r\n    pleased to know that I am, though at such a distance, sometimes in\r\n    your thoughts. I was much pleased, too, with what you have said of\r\n    the health and other gratifications you enjoy in Italy. I should\r\n    gladly have thanked you at the time, had I known how to address my\r\n    letter; and after receiving your proper direction from our friend\r\n    Miss Montgomery, I have been prevented from using it by various\r\n    things.... But though so long silent I have not been ungrateful, and\r\n    thank you with all my heart. The account you give of Venice is very\r\n    interesting. There is something affecting in still seeing the\r\n    descendants of the former Doges holding a diminished state in their\r\n    remaining palaces with so much courtesy. I am sure you have found\r\n    yourself a guest in their saloons, hung with paintings of their\r\n    ancestors, with very mixed feelings. However, Venice to the eye, as\r\n    you describe it, is Venice still; and with its lights at night\r\n    gleaming upon the waters makes a very vivid picture to my fancy. You\r\n    no doubt have fixed it on canvas, and can carry it about with you\r\n    for the delight of your friends who may never see the original.\r\n\r\n    In return to your kind inquiries after us, I have, all things\r\n    considered, a very good account to give. Ladies of four score and\r\n    upwards cannot expect to be robust, and need not be gay. We sit by\r\n    the fire-side with our books (except when those plaguy notes are to\r\n    be written) and receive the visits of our friendly neighbours very\r\n    contentedly, and, I ought to say, and trust I may say, very\r\n    thankfully.... This morning brought one in whom I feel sure that you\r\n    and your daughters take some interest, Maria Edgeworth. She has been\r\n    dangerously ill, but is now nearly recovered, and is come from\r\n    Ireland to pass the winter months with her sisters in London: weak\r\n    in body, but the mind as clear and the spirits as buoyant as ever.\r\n    You will be glad to hear that she even has it in her thoughts to\r\n    write a new work, and has the plan of it nearly arranged. There will\r\n    be nothing new in the story itself, but the purpose and treating of\r\n    it will be new, which is, perhaps, a better thing. In our retired\r\n    way of living, we know little of what goes on in the literary\r\n    world.... I was, however, in town for a few hours the other day, and\r\n    called upon a lady of rank who has _fashionable_ learned folks\r\n    coming about her, and she informed me that there are new ideas\r\n    regarding philosophy entertained in the world, and that Sir John\r\n    Herschel was now considered as a slight, second-rate man, or person.\r\n    Who are the first-rate she did not say, and, I suppose, you will not\r\n    be much mortified to hear that your name was not mentioned at all.\r\n    So much for our learning. My sister was much disappointed the other\r\n    day when, in expectation of a ghost story from Mr. Dickens, she only\r\n    got a grotesque moral allegory; now, as she delights in a ghost and\r\n    hates an allegory, this was very provoking.\r\n\r\n                             Believe me,\r\n                                 My dear Mrs. Somerville,\r\n                                     Yours with admiration and esteem,\r\n                                                            J. BAILLIE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n    FROM MISS JOANNA BAILLIE TO MRS. SOMERVILLE\r\n\r\n    HAMPSTEAD, _January 9th, 1851_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n    My dear Mary Somerville, whom I am proud to call my friend, and that\r\n    she so calls me. I could say much on this point, but I dare not. I\r\n    received your letter from Mr. Greig last night, and thank you very\r\n    gratefully. If my head were less confused I should do it better, but\r\n    the pride I have in thinking of you as philosopher and a woman\r\n    cannot be exceeded. I shall read your letter many times over. My\r\n    sister and myself at so great an age are waiting to be called away\r\n    in mercy by an Almighty Father, and we part with our earthly friends\r\n    as those whom we shall meet again. My great monster book is now\r\n    published, and your copy I shall send to your son who will peep into\r\n    it, and then forward it to yourself. I beg to be kindly and\r\n    respectfully remembered to your husband; I offer my best wishes to\r\n    your daughters....\r\n\r\n                               Yours, my dear Friend,\r\n                                          Very faithfully,\r\n                                                     JOANNA BAILLIE.\r\n\r\n    My sister begs of you and all your family to accept her best wishes.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM SIR JOHN HERSCHEL TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    _18th March, 1844._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    To have received a letter from you so long ago, and not yet to have\r\n    thanked you for it, is what I could hardly have believed myself--if\r\n    the rapid lapse of time in the uniform retirement in which we live\r\n    were not pressed upon me in a variety of ways which convince me that\r\n    as a man grows older, his sand, as the grains get low in the glass,\r\n    slips through more glibly, and steals away with accelerated speed. I\r\n    wish I could either send you a copy of my Cape observations, or tell\r\n    you they are published or even in the press. Far from it--I do not\r\n    expect to \"go to press\" before another year has elapsed, for though\r\n    I have got my catalogues of Southern nebulæ and Double stars reduced\r\n    and arranged, yet there is a great deal of other matter still to be\r\n    worked through, and I have every description of reduction entirely\r\n    to execute myself. These are very tedious, and I am a very slow\r\n    computer, and have been continually taken off the subject by other\r\n    matter, forced upon me by \"pressure from without.\" What I am now\r\n    engaged on is the monograph of the _principal_ Southern Nebulæ, the\r\n    object of which is to put on record every ascertainable particular\r\n    of their actual appearance and the stars visible in them, so as to\r\n    satisfy future observers whether _new stars_ have appeared, or\r\n    changes taken place in the nebulosity. To what an extent this work\r\n    may go you may judge from the fact that the catalogue of visible\r\n    stars actually mapped down in their places within the space of less\r\n    than a square degree in the nebula about [Greek: ê] Argus which I have\r\n    just completed comprises between 1300 and 1400 stars. This is indeed a\r\n    stupendous object. It is a vastly extensive branching and looped\r\n    nebula, in the centre of the densest part of which is [Greek: ê] Argus,\r\n    itself a most remarkable star, seeing that from the fourth magnitude\r\n    which it had in Ptolemy's time, it has risen (by _sudden starts_,\r\n    and not gradually) to such a degree of brilliancy as _now_ actually\r\n    to surpass Canopus, and to be second only to Sirius. One of these\r\n    _leaps_ I myself witnessed when in the interval of ceasing to\r\n    observe it in one year, and resuming its observation in two or three\r\n    months after in the next, it had sprung over the heads of _all the\r\n    stars of the first_ magnitude, from Fomalhaut and Regulus (the two\r\n    least of them) to [Greek: a] Centauri, which it then just equalled, and\r\n    which is the brightest of all but Canopus and Sirius! It has since\r\n    made a fresh jump--and who can say it will be the last?\r\n\r\n    One of the most beautiful objects in the southern hemisphere is a\r\n    pretty large, perfectly round, and very well-defined planetary nebula,\r\n    of a fine, full _independent_ blue colour--the only object I have ever\r\n    seen in the heavens fairly entitled to be called _independently_ blue,\r\n    _i.e._, not by contrast. Another superb and most striking object is\r\n    Lacaille's 30 Doradus, a nebula of great size in the larger nubicula,\r\n    of which it is impossible to give a better idea than to compare it to a\r\n    \"true lover's knot,\" or assemblage of nearly circular nebulous loops\r\n    uniting in a centre, in or near which is an exactly circular round dark\r\n    hole. Neither this nor the nebula about [Greek: ê] Argus have any, the\r\n    slightest, resemblance to the representations given of them by\r\n    Dunlop.... As you are so kind as to offer to obtain information on any\r\n    points interesting to me at Rome, here is one on which I earnestly\r\n    desire to obtain the means of forming a correct opinion, _i.e._, the\r\n    _real_ powers and merits of De Vico's great refractor at the Collegio\r\n    Romano. De Vico's accounts of it appear to me to have not a little of\r\n    the extra-marvellous in them. Saturn's _two_ close satellites regularly\r\n    observed--eight stars in the trapezium of Orion! [Greek: a] Aquilæ (as\r\n    Schumacher inquiringly writes to me) divided into three! the\r\n    supernumerary divisions of Saturn's ring well seen, &c., &c. And all by\r\n    a Cauchoix refractor of eight inches? I fear me that these wonders are\r\n    not for _female eyes_, the good monks are too well aware of the\r\n    penetrating qualities of such optics to allow them entry within the\r\n    seven-fold walls of their Collegio. Has Somerville ever looked through\r\n    it? On his report I know I could quite rely. As for Lord Rosse's great\r\n    reflector, I can only tell you what I hear, having never seen it, or\r\n    even his three feet one. The great one is not yet completed. Of the\r\n    other, those who _have_ looked through it speak in raptures. I met not\r\n    long since an officer who, at Halifax in Nova Scotia, saw _the comet_\r\n    at noon close to the sun, and very conspicuous the day after the\r\n    perihelion passage.\r\n\r\n    Your account of the pictures and other _deliciæ_ of Venice makes our\r\n    mouths water; but it is of no use, so we can only congratulate those\r\n    who are in the full enjoyment of such things.\r\n\r\n                                             Ever yours most truly,\r\n                                                           J. HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Rome I was elected Associate of the College of\r\nRisurgenti, and in the following April I became an honorary member of\r\nthe Imperial and Royal Academy of Science, Literature and Art at Arezzo.\r\nI finished an edition of the Physical Sciences, at which I had been\r\nworking, and in spring Somerville hired a small house belonging to the\r\nDuca Sforza Cesarini, at Genzano, close to and with a beautiful view of\r\nthe Lake of Nemi; but as I had not seen my son for some time, I now\r\navailed myself of the opportunity of travelling with our friend Sir\r\nFrederick Adam to England. We crossed the Channel at Ostend, and at the\r\nmouth of the Thames lay the old \"Venerable,\" in which my father was\r\nflag-captain at the battle of Camperdown. I had a joyful meeting with\r\nmy son and his wife, and we went to see many things that were new to me.\r\nOne of our first expeditions was to the British Museum. I had already\r\nseen the Elgin marbles, and the antiquities collected at Babylon by Mr.\r\nRich, when he was Consul at Bagdad, but now the Museum had been enriched\r\nby the marbles from Halicarnassus, and by the marvellous remains\r\nexcavated by Mr. Layard from the ruins of Nineveh, the very site of\r\nwhich had been for ages unknown.\r\n\r\nI frequently went to Turner's studio, and was always welcomed. No one\r\ncould imagine that so much poetical feeling existed in so rough an\r\nexterior. The water-colour exhibitions were very good; my countrymen\r\nstill maintained their superiority in that style of art, and the\r\ndrawings of some English ladies were scarcely inferior to those of\r\nfirst-rate artists, especially those of my friend, Miss Blake, of\r\nDanesbury.\r\n\r\nWhile in England I made several visits; the first was to my dear friends\r\nSir John and Lady Herschel, at Collingwood, who received me with the\r\nwarmest affection. I cannot express the pleasure it gave me to feel\r\nmyself at home in a family where not only the highest branches of\r\nscience were freely discussed, but where the accomplishments and graces\r\nof life were cultivated. I was highly gratified and proud of being\r\ngodmother to Rosa, the daughter of Sir John and Lady Herschel. Among\r\nother places near Collingwood I was taken to see an excellent\r\nobservatory formed by Mr. Dawes, a gentleman of independent fortune; and\r\nhere I must remark, to the honour of my countrymen, that at the time I\r\nam writing, there are twenty-six private observatories in Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, furnished with first-rate instruments, with which some of\r\nthe most important astronomical discoveries have been made.\r\n\r\n    [I received the following letter from my mother while we were at\r\n    Genzano. It is one of several which record in her natural and\r\n    unaffected words my mother's profound admiration for Sir John\r\n    Herschel.]\r\n\r\n    MRS. SOMERVILLE TO MISS SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    SYDENHAM, _1st September, 1844_.\r\n    _Sunday Night._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MARTHA,\r\n\r\n    ... We go to the Herschels' to-morrow, and there I shall finish this\r\n    letter, as it is impossible to get it in time for Tuesday's post,\r\n    but I have so much to do now that you must not expect a letter every\r\n    post, and I had no time to begin this before, and I am too tired to\r\n    sit up later to-night....\r\n\r\n    COLLINGWOOD, _Monday_.\r\n\r\n    This appears to be a remarkably beautiful place, with abundance of\r\n    fine timber.... W. brought your dear nice letter; it makes me long\r\n    to be with you, and, please God, I shall be so before long, as I set\r\n    off this day fortnight.\r\n\r\n    _Wednesday._\r\n\r\n    Yesterday I had a great deal of scientific talk with Sir John, and\r\n    a long walk in the grounds which are extensive, and very pretty.\r\n    Then the Airys arrived, and we had a large party at dinner.... I\r\n    think, now, as I always have done, that Sir John is by much the\r\n    highest and finest character I have ever met with; the most\r\n    gentlemanly and polished mind, combined with the most exalted\r\n    morality, and the utmost of human attainment. His view of everything\r\n    is philosophic, and at the same time highly poetical, in short, he\r\n    combines every quality that is admirable and excellent with the most\r\n    charming modesty, and Lady Herschel is quite worthy of such a\r\n    husband, which is the greatest praise I can give her. Their kindness\r\n    and affection for me has been unbounded. Lady H. told me she heard\r\n    such praises of you two that she is anxious to know you, and she\r\n    hopes you will always look upon her and her family as friends. The\r\n    christening went off as well as possible. Mr. Airy was godfather,\r\n    and Mrs. Airy and I godmothers, but I had the naming of the\r\n    child--Matilda Rose, after Lady Herschel's sister. I assure you I\r\n    was quite adroit in taking the baby from the nurse and giving her to\r\n    the clergyman. Sir John took Mrs. Airy and me a drive to see a very\r\n    fine picturesque castle a few miles off.... I have got loads of\r\n    things for experiments on light from Sir John with a variety of\r\n    papers, and you may believe that I have profited not a little by his\r\n    conversation, and have a thousand projects for study and writing, so\r\n    I think painting will be at a standstill, only that I have promised\r\n    to paint something for Lady Herschel. Sir John computes four or five\r\n    hours every day, and yet his Cape observations will not be finished\r\n    for two years. I have seen everything he is or has been doing.\r\n\r\n                                        Your affectionate mother,\r\n                                                     MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [My mother continues her recollections of this journey.]\r\n\r\nMy next visit was to Lord and Lady Charles Percy at Guy's Cliff, in\r\nWarwickshire, a pretty picturesque place of historical and romantic\r\nmemory. The society was pleasant, and I was taken to Kenilworth and\r\nWarwick Castle, on the banks of the Avon, a noble place, still bearing\r\nmarks of the Wars of the Roses. I never saw such magnificent oak-trees\r\nas those on the Leigh estate, near Guy's Cliff.\r\n\r\nI then visited my maiden namesake, Mrs. Fairfax, of Gilling Castle,\r\nYorkshire. She was a highly cultivated person, had been much abroad, and\r\nwas a warm-hearted friend. I was much interested in the principal room,\r\nfor a deep frieze surrounds the wall, on which are painted the coats of\r\narms of all the families with whom the Fairfaxes have intermarried,\r\nascending to very great antiquity; besides, every pane of glass in a\r\nvery large bay window in the same room is stained with one of these\r\ncoats of arms. Every morning after breakfast a prodigious flock of\r\npea-fowl came from the woods around to be fed.\r\n\r\nI now went to the vicinity of Kelso to visit my brother and\r\nsister-in-law, General and Mrs. Elliot, who lived on the banks of the\r\nTweed. We went to Jedburgh, the place of my birth. After many years I\r\nstill thought the valley of the Jed very beautiful; I fear the pretty\r\nstream has been invaded by manufactories: there is a perpetual war\r\nbetween civilization and the beauty of nature. I went to see the spot\r\nfrom whence I once took a sketch of Jedburgh Abbey and the manse in\r\nwhich I was born, which does not exist, I believe, now. When I was a\r\nvery young girl I made a painting from this sketch. Our next excursion\r\nwas to a lonely village called Yetholm, in the hills, some miles from\r\nKelso, belonging to the gipsies. The \"king\" and the other men were\r\nabsent, but the women were civil, and some of them very pretty. Our\r\nprincipal object in going there was to see a stone in the wall of a\r\nsmall and very ancient church at Linton, nearly in ruins, on which is\r\ncarved in relief the wyvern and wheel, the crest of the Somervilles.\r\n\r\nFrom Kelso I went to Edinburgh to spend a few days with Lord Jeffrey and\r\nhis family. No one who had seen his gentle kindness in domestic life and\r\nthe warmth of his attachment to his friends, could have supposed he\r\npossessed that power of ridicule and severity which made him the terror\r\nof authors. His total ignorance of science may perhaps excuse him for\r\nhaving admitted into the \"Review\" Brougham's intemperate article on the\r\nundulatory theory of light, a discovery which has immortalized the name\r\nof Dr. Young. I found Edinburgh, the city of my early recollections,\r\npicturesque and beautiful as ever, but enormously increased both to the\r\nnorth and to the south. Queen Street, which in my youth was open to the\r\nnorth and commanded a view of the Forth and the mountains beyond, was\r\nnow in the middle of the new town. All those I had formerly known were\r\ngone--a new generation had sprung up, living in all the luxury of modern\r\ntimes. On returning to London I spent a pleasant time with my son and\r\nhis wife, who invited all those to meet me whom they thought I should\r\nlike to see.\r\n\r\n    [My mother returned to Rome in autumn in company with an old friend\r\n    and her daughter.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe winter passed without any marked event, but always agreeably; new\r\npeople came, making a pleasant variety in the society, which, though\r\nstill refined, was beginning to be very mixed, as was amusingly seen at\r\nTorlonia's balls and tableaux, where many of the guests formed a\r\nsingular contrast with the beautiful Princess, who was of the historical\r\nfamily of the Colonnas. I was often ashamed of my countrymen, who, all\r\nthe while speaking of the Italians with contempt, tried to force\r\nthemselves into their houses. Prince Borghese refused the same person an\r\ninvitation to a ball five times. I was particularly scrupulous about\r\ninvitations, and never asked for one in my life; nor did I ever seek to\r\nmake acquaintances with the view of being invited to their houses.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [The following letters give a sketch of life during the summer\r\n    months at Rome:--]\r\n\r\n    MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    ROME, _3rd August, 1845_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR WORONZOW,\r\n\r\n    ... I am glad you are so much pleased with my bust, and that it is\r\n    so little injured after having been at the bottom of the sea. You\r\n    will find Macdonald a very agreeable and original person. As to\r\n    spending the summer in Rome, you may make yourself quite easy, for\r\n    the heat is very bearable, the thermometer varying between 75° and\r\n    80° in our rooms during the day, which are kept in darkness, and at\r\n    night it always becomes cooler. Thank God, we are all quite well,\r\n    and Somerville particularly so; he goes out during the day to amuse\r\n     himself, and the girls paint in the Borghese gallery. As for\r\n    myself I have always plenty to do till half past three, when we\r\n    dine, and after dinner I sleep for an hour or more, and when the sun\r\n    is set we go out to wander a little, for a long walk is too\r\n    fatiguing at this season. We have very little society, the only\r\n    variety we have had was a very pretty supper party given by Signore\r\n    Rossi, the French minister, to the Prince and Princess de Broglie,\r\n    son and daughter-in-law of the duke. The young lady is extremely\r\n    beautiful, and as I knew the late Duchesse de Broglie (Madame de\r\n    Staël's daughter) we soon got acquainted. They are newly married,\r\n    and have come to spend part of the summer in Rome, so you see people\r\n    are not so much alarmed as the English.... We went yesterday evening\r\n    to see the Piazza Navona full of water; it is flooded every Saturday\r\n    and Sunday at this season; there is music, and the whole population\r\n    of Rome is collected round it, carts and carriages splashing through\r\n    it in all directions. I think it must be about three feet deep. It\r\n    was there the ancient Romans had their naval games; and the custom\r\n    of filling it with water in summer has lasted ever since. The\r\n    fountain is one of the most beautiful in Rome, which is saying a\r\n    great deal; indeed the immense gush of the purest water from\r\n    innumerable fountains in every street and every villa is one of the\r\n    peculiarities of Rome. I fear from what I have heard of those in\r\n    Trafalgar Square that the quantity of water will be very miserable.\r\n\r\n     The papers (I mean the Times), are full of abuse of Mr. Sedgwick\r\n    and Dr. Buckland, but their adversaries write such nonsense that it\r\n    matters little. I do not think I have anything to add to my new\r\n    edition. If you hear of anything of moment let me know. Perhaps\r\n    something may have transpired at the British Association....\r\n\r\n                                        Your affectionate mother,\r\n                                                  MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    ROME, _May 28th, 1845_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR WORONZOW,\r\n\r\n    I don't know why I have so long delayed writing to you. I rather\r\n    think it is because we have been living so quiet a life, one day so\r\n    precisely similar to the preceding, that there has been nothing\r\n    worth writing about. This is our first really summer-like day, and\r\n    splendid it is; but we are sitting in a kind of twilight. The only\r\n    means of keeping the rooms cool is by keeping the house dark and\r\n    shutting out the external air, and then in the evening we have a\r\n    delightful walk; the country is splendid, the Campagna one sheet of\r\n    deep verdure and flowers of every kind in abundance. We generally\r\n    have six or seven large nosegays in the room; we have only to go to\r\n    some of the neighbouring villas and gather them. Most of the English\r\n    are gone; people make a great mistake in not remaining during the\r\n    hot weather, this is the time for enjoyment. We are busy all the\r\n    morning, and in the afternoon we take our book or drawing materials\r\n    and sit on the grass in some of the lovely villas for hours; then we\r\n    come home to tea, and are glad to see anyone who will come in for an\r\n    hour or two. We have had a son of Mr. Babbage here. He is employed\r\n    in making the railway that is to go from Genoa to Milan, and he was\r\n    travelling with eight other Englishmen who came to make\r\n    arrangements for covering Italy with a network of these iron roads,\r\n    connecting all the great cities and also the two seas from Venice to\r\n    Milan and Genoa and from Ancona by Rome to Civita Vecchia. However\r\n    the Pope is opposed to the latter part, but they say the cardinals\r\n    and people wish it so much that he will at last consent.... Many\r\n    thanks for the _Vestiges_, &c. I think it a powerful production, and\r\n    was highly pleased with it, but I can easily see that it will offend\r\n    in some quarters; however it should be remembered that there has\r\n    been as much opposition to the true system of astronomy and to\r\n    geological facts as there can be to this. At all events free and\r\n    open discussion of all natural and moral phenomena must lead to\r\n    truth at last. Is Babbage the author? I rather think he would not be\r\n    so careful in concealing his name....\r\n\r\n    [My mother made some curious experiments upon the effect of the\r\n    solar spectrum on juices of plants and other substances, of which\r\n    she sent an account to Sir John Herschel, who answered telling her\r\n    that he had communicated her account of her experiments to the Royal\r\n    Society.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    SIR JOHN HERSCHEL TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    COLLINGWOOD, _November 21st, 1845_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I cannot express to you the pleasure I experienced from the receipt\r\n    of your letter and the perusal of the elegant experiments it\r\n    relates, which appear to me of the highest interest and show (what I\r\n    always suspected), that there is a world of wonders awaiting\r\n    disclosure in the solar spectrum, and that influences widely\r\n    differing from either light, heat or colour are transmitted to us\r\n    from our central luminary, which are mainly instrumental in evolving\r\n    and maturing the splendid hues of the vegetable creation and\r\n    elaborating the juices to which they owe their beauty and their\r\n    vitality. I think it certain that heat goes for something in\r\n    evaporating your liquids and thereby causing some of your phenomena;\r\n    but there is a difference of _quality_ as well as of _quantity_ of\r\n    heat brought into view which renders it susceptible of analysis by\r\n    the coloured juices so that in certain parts of the spectrum it is\r\n    retained and fixed, in others reflected according as the nature of\r\n    the tint favours the one or the other. Pray go on with these\r\n    delightful experiments. I wish you could save yourself the fatigue\r\n    of watching and directing your sunbeam by a clock work. If I were at\r\n    your elbow I could rig you out a heliotrope quite sufficient with\r\n    the aid of any common wooden clock.... Now I am going to take a\r\n    liberty (but not till after duly consulting Mr. Greig with whose\r\n    approbation I act, and you are not to gainsay our proceedings) and\r\n    that is to communicate your results in the form of \"an extract of a\r\n    letter\" to myself--to the Royal Society. You may be very sure that I\r\n    would not do this if I thought that the experiments were not\r\n    intrinsically quite deserving to be recorded in the pages of the\r\n    Phil. Trans. and if I were not sure that they will lead to a vast\r\n    field of curious and beautiful research; and as you have already\r\n    once contributed to the Society, (on a subject connected with the\r\n    spectrum and the sunbeam) this will, I trust, not appear in your\r\n    eyes in a formidable or a repulsive light, and it will be a great\r\n    matter of congratulation to us all to know that these subjects\r\n    continue to engage your attention, and that you can turn your\r\n    residence in that sunny clime to such admirable account. So do not\r\n    call upon me to retract (for before you get this the papers will be\r\n    in the secretary's hands).\r\n\r\n    I am here nearly as much out of the full stream of scientific\r\n    matters as you at Rome. We had a full and very satisfactory meeting\r\n    at Cambridge of the British Association, with a full attendance of\r\n    continental magnetists and meteorologists, and within these few days\r\n    I have learned that our Government meant to grant all our requests\r\n    and continue the magnetic and meteorological observations. Humboldt\r\n    has sent me his Cosmos (Vol. I.), which is good, all but the first\r\n    60 pages, which are occupied in telling his readers what his book is\r\n    _not_ to be. Dr. Whewell has just published _another_ book on the\r\n    Principles of Morals, and also _another_ on education, in which he\r\n    cries up the geometrical processes in preference to analysis....\r\n\r\n                                        Yours very faithfully,\r\n                                                  J. HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princesse de Broglie came to Rome in 1845, and Signore\r\nPellegrino Rossi, at this time French Minister at the Vatican, gave them\r\na supper party, to which we were invited. We had met with him long\r\nbefore at Geneva, where he had taken refuge after the insurrection of\r\n1821. He was greatly esteemed there and admired for his eloquence in the\r\nlectures he gave in the University. It was a curious circumstance, that\r\nhe, who was a Roman subject, and was exiled, and, if I am not mistaken,\r\ncondemned to death, should return to Rome as French Minister. He had a\r\nremarkably fine countenance, resembling some ancient Roman bust. M.\r\nThiers had brought in a law in the French Chambers to check the audacity\r\nof the Jesuits, and Rossi was sent to negotiate with the Pope. We had\r\nseen much of him at Rome, and were horrified, in 1848, to hear that he\r\nhad been assassinated on the steps of the Cancelleria, at Rome, where\r\nthe Legislative Assembly met, and whither he was proceeding to attend\r\nits first meeting. No one offered to assist him, nor to arrest the\r\nmurderers except Dr. Pantaleone, a much esteemed Roman physician, and\r\nmember of the Chamber, who did what he could to save him, but in vain;\r\nhe was a great loss to the Liberal cause.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of summer we spent a month most agreeably at Subiaco,\r\nreceiving much civility from the Benedictine monks of the Sacro Speco,\r\nand visiting all the neighbouring towns, each one perched on some\r\nhill-top, and one more romantically picturesque than the other. It was\r\nin this part of the country that Claude Lorraine and Poussin studied and\r\npainted. I never saw more beautiful country, or one which afforded so\r\nmany exquisite subjects for a landscape painter. We went all over the\r\ncountry on mules--to some of the towns, such as Cervara, up steep\r\nflights of steps cut in the rock. The people, too, were extremely\r\npicturesque, and the women still wore their costumes, which probably now\r\nthey have laid aside for tweeds and Manchester cottons.\r\n\r\nI often during my winters in Rome went to paint from nature in the\r\nCampagna, either with Somerville or with Lady Susan Percy, who drew very\r\nprettily. Once we set out a little later than usual, when, driving\r\nthrough the Piazza of the Bocca della Verità, we both called out, \"Did\r\nyou see that? How horrible! \"It was the guillotine; an execution had\r\njust taken place, and had we been a quarter of an hour earlier we should\r\nhave passed at the fatal moment. Under Gregory XVI. everything was\r\nconducted in the most profound secrecy; arrests were made almost at our\r\nvery door, of which we knew nothing; Mazzini was busily at work on one\r\nside, the Jesuitical party actively intriguing, according to their wont,\r\non the other; and in the mean time society went on gaily at the surface,\r\nignorant of and indifferent to the course of events. We were preparing\r\nto leave Rome when Gregory died. We put off our journey to see his\r\nfuneral, and the Conclave, which terminated, in the course of scarcely\r\ntwo days, in the election of Pius IX. We also saw the new Pope's\r\ncoronation, and witnessed the beginning of that popularity which lasted\r\nso short a time. Much was expected from him, and in the beginning of his\r\nreign the moderate liberals fondly hoped that Italy would unite in one\r\ngreat federation, with Pius IX. at the head of it; entirely forgetting\r\nhow incompatible a theocracy or government by priests ever must be with\r\nall progress and with liberal institutions. Their hopes were soon\r\nblighted, and after all the well-known events of 1848 and 1849, a\r\nreaction set in all over Italy, except in gallant little Piedmont, where\r\nthe constitution was maintained, thanks to Victor Emmanuel, and\r\nespecially to that great genius, Camillo Cavour, and in spite of the\r\ndisastrous reverses at Novara. Once more in 1859 Piedmont went to war\r\nwith Austria, this time with success, and with the not disinterested\r\nhelp of France. One province after another joined her, and Italy, freed\r\nfrom all the little petty princes, and last, not least, from the\r\nBourbons, has become that one great kingdom which was the dream of some\r\nof her greatest men in times of old.\r\n\r\nWe went to Bologna for a short time, and there the enthusiasm for the\r\nnew Pope was absolutely intolerable. \"Viva Pio Nono!\" was shouted night\r\nand day. There was no repose; bands of music went about the streets,\r\nplaying airs composed for the occasion, and in the theatres it was even\r\nworse, for the acting was interrupted, and the orchestra called upon to\r\nplay the national tunes in vogue, and repeat them again and again, amid\r\nthe deafening shouts and applause of the excited audience. We found the\r\nBolognese very sociable, and it was by far the most musical society I\r\never was in. Rossini was living in Bologna, and received in the evening,\r\nand there was always music, amateur and professional, at his house.\r\nFrequently there was part-singing or choruses, and after the music was\r\nover the evening ended with a dance. We frequently saw Rossini some\r\nyears later, when we resided at Florence. He was clever and amusing in\r\nconversation, but satirical. He was very bitter against the modern style\r\nof opera-singing, and considered the singers of the present day, with\r\nsome exceptions, as wanting in study and finish. He objected to much of\r\nthe modern music, as dwelling too constantly on the highest notes of the\r\nvoice, whereby it is very soon deteriorated, and the singer forced to\r\nscream; besides which, he considered the orchestral accompaniments too\r\nloud. I, who recollected Pasta, Malibran, Grisi, Rubini, and others of\r\nthat epoch, could not help agreeing with him when I compared them to the\r\nsingers I heard at the Pergola and elsewhere. The theatre, too, was\r\ngood at Bologna, and we frequently went to it.\r\n\r\nOne evening we were sitting on the balcony of the hotel, when we saw a\r\nman stab another in the back of the neck, and then run away. The victim\r\nstaggered along for a minute, and then fell down in a pool of blood. He\r\nhad been a spy of the police under Gregory XVI., and one of the\r\nprincipal agents of his cruel government. He was so obnoxious to the\r\npeople that his assassin has never been discovered.\r\n\r\nFrom Bologna we went for a few weeks to Recoaro, where I drank the\r\nwaters, after which we travelled to England by the St. Gothard pass.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The vessel on board which this bust was shipped for\r\nEngland ran on a shoal and sank, but as the accident happened in shallow\r\nwater, the bust was recovered, none the worse for its immersion in salt\r\nwater.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHES \"PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\"--LETTER FROM HUMBOLDT--CHRISTMAS AT\r\nCOLLINGWOOD--LETTER FROM MRS.

I at once determined to put my manuscript in the fire when\r\nSomerville said, \"Do not be rash--consult some of our friends--Herschel\r\nfor instance.\" So I sent the MS. to Sir John Herschel, who advised me by\r\nall means to publish it. It was very favourably reviewed by Sir Henry\r\nHolland in the \"Quarterly,\" which tended much to its success. I\r\nafterwards sent a copy of a later edition to Baron Humboldt, who wrote\r\nme a very kind letter in return.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    BARON HUMBOLDT TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    A SANS SOUCI, _ce 12 Juillet, 1849_.\r\n\r\n    MADAME,\r\n\r\n    C'est un devoir bien doux à remplir, Madame, que de vous offrir\r\n    l'hommage renouvellé de mon dévouement et de ma respectueuse\r\n    admiration. Ces sentimens datent de bien loin chez l'homme\r\n    antidiluvien auquel vous avez daigné adresser des lignes si aimables\r\n    et la nouvelle édition de ce bel ouvrage qui m'a charmé et\r\n    _instruit_ dès qu'il avait paru pour la première fois. A cette\r\n    grande supériorité que vous possedez et qui a si noblement illustré\r\n    votre nom, dans les hautes régions de l'analyse mathématique, vous\r\n    joignez, Madame, une variété de connaissances dans toutes les\r\n    parties de la physique et de l'histoire naturelle descriptive. Après\r\n    votre \"Mechanism of the Heavens,\" le philosophique ouvrage\r\n    \"Connexion of the Physical Sciences\" avait été l'objet de ma\r\n    constante admiration. Je l'ai lu en entier et puis relu dans la\r\n    septième édition qui a paru en 1846 dans les tems où nous étions\r\n    plus calme, où l'orage politique ne grondait que de loin. L'auteur\r\n    de l'imprudent \"Cosmos\" devoit saluer plus que tout autre la\r\n    \"Géographie Physique\" de Mary Somerville. J'ai su me la procurer dès\r\n    les premières semaines par les soins de notre ami commun le Chev.\r\n    Bunsen. Je ne connais dans aucune langue un ouvrage de Géographie\r\n    physique que l'on pourrait comparer au votre. Je l'ai de nouveau\r\n    étudié dans la dernière édition que je dois à votre gracieuse\r\n    bienveillance. Le sentiment de précision que vos habitudes de\r\n    \"Géomètre\" vous ont si profondement imprimé, pénètre tous vos\r\n    travaux, Madame. Aucun fait, aucune des grandes vues de la nature\r\n    vous échappent. Vous avez profité et des livres et des conversations\r\n    des voyageurs dans cette malheureuse Italie où passe la grande route\r\n    de l'Orient et de l'Inde. J'ai été surpris de la justice de vos\r\n    aperçus sur la Géographie des plantes et des animaux. Vous dominez\r\n    dans ces régions comme en astronomie, en météorologie, en\r\n    magnetisme. Que n'ajoutez-vous pas la sphère céleste, l'uranologie,\r\n    votre patrimoine, à la sphère terrestre? C'est vous seule qui\r\n    pourriez donner à votre belle litérature un ouvrage cosmologique\r\n    original, un ouvrage écrit avec cette lucidité et ce goût que\r\n    distingue tout ce qui est émané de votre plume. On a, je le sais,\r\n    beaucoup de bienveillance pour mon Cosmos dans votre patrie; mais il\r\n    en est des _formes_ de composition littéraires, comme de la variété\r\n    des races et de la différence primitive des langues. Un ouvrage\r\n    traduit manque de vie; ce que plait sur les bords du Rhin doit\r\n    paraître bizarre sur les bords de la Tamise et de la Seine. Mon\r\n    ouvrage est une production essentiellement allemande, et ce\r\n    caractère même, j'en suis sûr, loin de m'en plaindre lui donne le\r\n    goût du terroir. Je jouis d'une bonne fortune à laquelle (à cause de\r\n    mon long séjour en France, de mes prédilections personnelles, de mes\r\n    hérésies politiques) le _Léopard_ ne m'avait pas trop accoutumé. Je\r\n    demande à l'illustre auteur du volume sur la Mécanique Céleste\r\n    d'avoir le courage d'agrandir sa Géographie Physique. Je suis sûr\r\n    que le grand homme que nous aimons le plus, vous et moi, Sir John\r\n    Herschel, serait de mon opinion. Le MONDE, je me sers du titre que\r\n    Descartes voulait donner à un livre dont nous n'avons que de pauvres\r\n    fragmens; le _Monde_ doit être écrit pour les Anglais par un auteur\r\n    de race pure. Il n'y a pas de sève, pas de vitalité dans les\r\n    traductions les mieux faites. Ma santé s'est conservé\r\n    miraculeusement à l'âge de quatre-vingts ans, de mon ardeur pour le\r\n    travail nocturne au milieu des agitations d'une position que je n'ai\r\n    pas besoin de vous depeindre puisque l'excellente Mademoiselle\r\n    de ---- vous l'a fait connaître. J'ai bouleversé, changé mes deux\r\n    volumes des \"Ansichten.\" Il n'en est resté que 1/4. C'est comme un\r\n    nouvel ouvrage que j'aurai bientôt le bonheur de vous adresser si M.\r\n    Cotta pense pouvoir hasarder une publication dans ces tems où la\r\n    force physique croit guérir un mal moral et _vacciner_ le\r\n    contentement à l'Allemagne unitaire!! Le troisième volume de mon\r\n    Cosmos avance, mais la sérénité manque aux âmes moins crédules.\r\n\r\n    Agréez, je vous supplie, l'hommage de mon affectueuse et\r\n    respectueuse reconnaissance,\r\n\r\n                                             ALEXANDRE DE HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSomerville and I spent the Christmas at Collingwood with our friends the\r\nHerschels. The party consisted of Mr. Airy, Astronomer-Royal, and Mr.\r\nAdams, who had taken high honours at Cambridge. This young man and M.\r\nLeverrier, the celebrated French astronomer, had separately calculated\r\nthe orbit of Neptune and announced it so nearly at the same time, that\r\neach country claims the honour of the discovery. Mr. Adams told\r\nSomerville that the following sentence in the sixth edition of the\r\n\"Connexion of the Physical Sciences,\" published in the year 1842, put it\r\ninto his head to calculate the orbit of Neptune. \"If after the lapse of\r\nyears the tables formed from a combination of numerous observations\r\nshould be still inadequate to represent the motions of Uranus, the\r\ndiscrepancies may reveal the existence, nay, even the mass and orbit of\r\na body placed for ever beyond the sphere of vision.\" That prediction was\r\nfulfilled in 1846, by the discovery of Neptune revolving at the distance\r\nof 3,000,000,000 of miles from the sun. The mass of Neptune, the size\r\nand position of his orbit in space, and his periodic time, were\r\ndetermined from his disturbing action on Uranus before the planet itself\r\nhad been seen.\r\n\r\nWe left Collingwood as ever with regret.\r\n\r\n    [The following is an extract from a letter written by my mother\r\n    during this visit:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS.

You can more easily conceive than I can describe the great\r\n    kindness and affection which we have received from both Sir John and\r\n    Lady Herschel; I feel a pride and pleasure beyond what I can\r\n    express in having such friends. Collingwood is a house by itself in\r\n    the world, there certainly is nothing like it for all that is great\r\n    and good. The charm of the conversation is only equalled by its\r\n    variety--every subject Sir John touches turns to doubly refined\r\n    gold; profound, brilliant, amiable, and highly poetical, I could\r\n    never end admiring and praising him. Then the children are so nice\r\n    and he so kind and amusing to them, making them quite his friends\r\n    and companions.\r\n\r\n                              Yours, my dearest Woronzow,\r\n                                        Most affectionately,\r\n                                                  M. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe had formed such a friendship with Mr. Faraday that while we lived\r\nabroad he sent me a copy of everything he published, and on returning to\r\nEngland we renewed our friendship with that illustrious philosopher, and\r\nattended his lectures at the Royal Institution. He had already\r\nmagnetized a ray of polarised light, but was still lecturing on the\r\nmagnetic and diamagnetic properties of matter. At the last lecture we\r\nattended he showed the diamagnetism of flame, which had been proved by a\r\nforeign philosopher. Mr. Faraday never would accept of any honour; he\r\nlived in a circle of friends to whom he was deeply attached. A touching\r\nand beautiful memoir was published of him by his friend and successor,\r\nProfessor Tyndall, an experimental philosopher of the very highest\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\n    [The following letter was the last my mother received from Faraday:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM PROFESSOR FARADAY TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    ROYAL INSTITUTION, _17th January, 1859_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    So you have remembered me again, and I have the delight of receiving\r\n    from you a new copy of that work which has so often instructed me;\r\n    and I may well say, cheered me in my simple homely course through\r\n    life in this house. It was most kind to think of me; but ah! how\r\n    sweet it is to believe that I have your _approval_ in matters where\r\n    kindness would be nothing, where judgment alone must rule. I almost\r\n    doubt myself when I think I have your approbation, to some degree at\r\n    least, in what I may have thought or said about gravitation, the\r\n    forces of nature, their conservation, &c. As it is, I _cannot_ go\r\n    back from these thoughts; on the contrary, I feel encouraged to go\r\n    on by way of experiment, but am not so able as I was formerly; for\r\n    when I try to hold the necessary group of thoughts in mind at one\r\n    time, with the judgment suspended on almost all of them, then my\r\n    head becomes giddy, and I am obliged to lay all aside for a while. I\r\n    am trying for _time_ in magnetic action, and do not despair of\r\n    reaching it, even though it may be only that of light. _Nous\r\n    verrons._\r\n\r\n    I have been putting into one volume various papers of mine on\r\n    experimental branches in chemistry and physics. The index and\r\n    title-page has gone to the printer, and I expect soon to receive\r\n    copies from him. I shall ask Mr. Murray to help me in sending one to\r\n    you which I hope you will honour by acceptance. There is nothing new\r\n    in it, except a few additional pages about \"_regelation_,\" and also\r\n    \"gravity.\" It is useful to get one's scattered papers together with\r\n    an index, and society seems to like the collection sufficiently to\r\n    pay the expenses.... Pray remember me most kindly to all with whom I\r\n    may take that privilege, and believe me to be most truly,\r\n\r\n                                   Your admirer and\r\n                                         faithful servant,\r\n                                             M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [My mother wrote of this letter:--]\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _8th February, 1859_.\r\n\r\n... I have had the most charming and gratifying letter from Faraday; I\r\ncannot tell you how I value such a mark of approbation and friendship\r\nfrom the greatest experimental philosopher and discoverer next to\r\nNewton.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe returned to the continent in autumn, so I could not superintend the\r\npublication of my \"Physical Geography,\" but Mr. Pentland kindly\r\nundertook to carry it through the press. Though I never was personally\r\nacquainted with Mr. Keith Johnston, of Edinburgh, that eminent\r\ngeographer gave me copies of both the first and second editions of his\r\nsplendid \"Atlas of Physical Geography,\" which were of the greatest use\r\nto me. Besides, he published some time afterwards a small \"School Atlas\r\nof Ancient, Modern, and Physical Geography,\" intended to accompany my\r\nwork; obligations which I gratefully acknowledge. No one has attempted\r\nto copy my \"Connexion of the Physical Sciences,\" the subjects are too\r\ndifficult; but soon after the publication of the \"Physical Geography\" a\r\nnumber of cheap books appeared, just keeping within the letter of the\r\nlaw, on which account it has only gone through five editions. However a\r\nsixth is now required.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe moment was unfavourable for going into Italy, as war was raging\r\nbetween Charles Albert and the Austrians, so we resolved to remain at\r\nMunich, and wait the course of events. We got a very pretty little\r\napartment, well furnished with stoves, and opposite the house of the\r\nMarchese Fabio Pallavicini, formerly Sardinian minister at Munich. We\r\nspent most of our evenings very pleasantly at their house. We attended\r\nthe concerts at the Odeon of classical music: the execution was perfect,\r\nbut the music was so refined and profound that it passed my\r\ncomprehension, and I thought it tedious. The hours at Munich were so\r\nearly that the opera ended almost at the time it began in London.\r\n\r\nIn the spring we went to Salzburg, where we remained all summer. We had\r\nan apartment in a dilapidated old château, about an hour's walk from the\r\ntown, called Leopold's Krone. The picturesque situation of the town\r\nreminded me of the Castle and Old Town of Edinburgh. The view from our\r\nwindows was alpine, and the trees bordering the roads were such as I\r\nhave rarely seen out of England. We made many excursions to\r\nBerchtesgaden, where King Louis and his court were then living, and went\r\nto the upper end of the Königsee. I have repeatedly been at sea in very\r\nstormy weather without the smallest idea of fear; but the black, deep\r\nwater of this lake, under the shadow of the precipitous mountains, made\r\na disagreeable impression on me. I thought if I were to be drowned I\r\nshould prefer the blue sea to that cold, black pool. The flora was\r\nlovely, and on returning from our expeditions in the evening, the damp,\r\nmossy banks were luminous with glowworms: I never saw so many, either\r\nbefore or since. We never fail to make acquaintances wherever we go, and\r\nour friends at Munich had given us letters to various people who were\r\npassing the summer there, many of whom had evening receptions once a\r\nweek. At the Countess Irene Arco's beautiful Gothic château of Anif,\r\nwhich rises out of a small pellucid lake, and is reached by a bridge, we\r\nspent many pleasant evenings, as well as at Countess Bellegarde's, and\r\nat Aigen, which belonged to the Cardinal Schwartzenberg. We never saw\r\nhim, but went to visit his niece, with whom we were intimate.\r\n\r\nThe war being over, we went by Innsbruck and the Brenner to Colà, on the\r\nLago di Garda, within five miles of Peschiera, where we spent a month\r\nwith Count and Countess Erizzo Miniscalchi, who had been our intimate\r\nfriends for many years. The devastation of the country was frightful.\r\nPeschiera and its fortifications were in ruins; the villages around had\r\nbeen burnt down, and the wretched inhabitants were beginning to repair\r\ntheir roofless houses. Our friends themselves had but recently returned\r\nto Colà, which, from its commanding situation, was always the\r\nheadquarters of whatever army was in possession of the country around.\r\nOn this account, the family had to fly more than once at the approach of\r\nthe enemy. In 1848 the Countess had fled to Milan, and was confined at\r\nthe very time the Austrians under Radetsky were besieging the town,\r\nwhich was defended by Charles Albert. Fearing what might occur when the\r\ncity was surrendered, the lady, together with her new-born infant and\r\nthe rest of her family, escaped the next day with considerable\r\ndifficulty, and travelled to Genoa.\r\n\r\nAlthough not acquainted with quite so many languages as Mezzofanti,\r\nCount Miniscalchi is a remarkable linguist, especially with regard to\r\nArabic and other oriental tongues. He has availed himself of his talent,\r\nand published several works, the most interesting of which is a\r\ntranslation of the Gospel of St. John from Syro-Chaldaic (the language\r\nprobably spoken by our Saviour) into Latin. The manuscript, from which\r\nthis translation is made, is preserved in the Vatican.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [While we were at Colà my mother received a visit from a very\r\n    distinguished and gifted lady, the Countess Bon-Brenzoni. As an\r\n    instance of the feelings entertained by an Italian woman towards my\r\n    mother, I insert a letter written by the Countess some time\r\n    afterwards, and also an extract from her poems:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM THE COUNTESS BON-BRENZONI TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    VERONA, _28 Maggio, 1853_.\r\n\r\n    ILLUSTRE SIGNORA,\r\n\r\n    Fui molto contenta udendo che finalmente le sia giunto l'involto\r\n    contenente le copie stampate del Carme, ch' ebbi l'onore di poterle\r\n    offerire, mentre io era in gran pensiero non forse fossero insorte\r\n    difficoltà, o ritardi, in causa della posta. Ma, ben più che per\r\n    questo la sua graziosissima lettera mi fù di vera consolazione, per\r\n    l'accoglienza tutta benevola e generosa ch' Ella fece a' miei versi.\r\n    La ringrazio delle parole piene di bontà ch' Ella mi scrive, e di\r\n    aversi preso la gentil cura di farlo in italiano; così potess' io\r\n    ricambiarla scrivendo a Lei in inglese! Pur mi conforta la certezza\r\n    che il linguaggio delle anime sia uno solo; mentre io non so s' io\r\n    debba chiamar presunzione, o ispirazione questa, che mi fa credere,\r\n    che esista fra la sua e la mia una qualche intelligenza, e\r\n    quantunque i suoi meriti e la sua bontà me ne spieghino in gran\r\n    parte il mistero, pure trovo essere cosa non comune questo pensiero,\r\n    che al mio cuore parla di Lei incessantemente, da quel giorno ch' io\r\n    l'ho veduta per la prima e l'unica volta!\r\n\r\n    Ah se è vero che fra i sentimenti di compiacenza ch' Ella provò per\r\n    gli elogi ottenuti de' suoi lavori, abbia saputo trovar luogo fra i\r\n    più cari quello che le destò nell' animo l'espressione viva e\r\n    sincera della mia ammirazione e del mio umile affetto, io raggiunsi\r\n    un punto a cui certo non avea osato aspirare!\r\n\r\n    Il trovarmi con Lei a Colà, od altrove che fosse, è uno de' miei più\r\n    cari desideri, e son lieta delle sue parole che me ne danno qualche\r\n    speranza.\r\n\r\n     Voglia presentare i miei distinti doveri all' eccelente suo Sig^re\r\n    marito ed alle amabili figlie; e mentre io le prego da Dio le più\r\n    desiderabili benedizioni, Ella si ricordi di me siccome di una\r\n    persona, che sebbene lontana fisicamente, le è sempre vicina coll'\r\n    animo, nei sentimenti della più affetuosa venerazione.\r\n\r\n           Incoraggiata dalla sua bontà, mi onoro segnarmi\r\n                                         amica affezionatissima\r\n                                             CATERINA BON-BRENZONI.\r\n\r\nThe \"Carme\" spoken of in the above letter form a long poem on modern\r\nastronomy, entitled \"I Cieli,\" (published by Vallardi. Milan: 1853).\r\nThe opening lines contain the following address to Mrs.\r\nSomerville,--doubtless a genuine description of the author's feelings on\r\nfirst meeting the simple-mannered lady whose intellectual greatness she\r\nhad long learned to appreciate:--\r\n\r\n    Donna, quel giorno ch' io ti vidi in prima,\r\n    Dimmi, hai Tu scôrto sul mio volto i segni\r\n    Dell' anima commossa?--Hai Tu veduto\r\n    Come trepida innanzi io ti venia,\r\n    E come reverenza e maraviglia\r\n    Tenean sospesa sull' indocil labbro\r\n    La parola mal certa?--Ah! dimmi, hai scôrto\r\n    Come fur vinte dall' affetto allora\r\n    Che t'udii favellar soave e piana,\r\n    Coll' angelica voce e l'umiltade,\r\n    Che a' suoi più cari sapïenza insegna?--\r\n    Questa, io dicea tra me, questa è Colei,\r\n    Di che le mille volte udito ho il nome\r\n    Venerato suonar tra i più famosi?\r\n    Questa è Colei che negli eterei spazj\r\n    Segue il cammin degli astri, e ne misura\r\n    Peso, moto, distanza, orbita e luce?\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAnother record of our visit to Colà is in a letter of my mother to my\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n    MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    TURIN, _4th Dec., 1849_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST WORONZOW,\r\n\r\n    We arrived here all well the day before yesterday, after a fair but\r\n    bitterly cold journey, bright sunshine and keen frost, and to-day we\r\n    have a fall of snow.... It was a great disappointment not finding\r\n    letters here, and I fear many have been lost on both sides, though\r\n    we took care not to touch on political events, as all letters are\r\n    opened by the Austrian police in Lombardy. We spent five weeks with\r\n    our friends the Miniscalchis very agreeably, and received every mark\r\n    of kindness and hospitality. They only live at Verona during the\r\n    winter, and we found them in their country house at Colà situated on\r\n    a height overlooking the Lago di Garda, with the snowy Alps on the\r\n    opposite side of the lake. The view from their grounds is so fine\r\n    that I was tempted to paint once more. They took us to see all the\r\n    places in the neighbourhood; often a sad sight, from having been the\r\n    seat of war and siege. The villages are burnt and the churches in\r\n    ruin. But the people are repairing the mischief as fast as possible,\r\n    and the fields are already well cultivated. The Count is a man of\r\n    great learning and is occupied in the comparison of languages,\r\n    especially the Eastern; he knows twenty-four and speaks Arabic as\r\n    fluently as Italian. He is in the habit of speaking both Arabic and\r\n    Chaldee every day, as there is a most learned Chaldean priest living\r\n    with them, whose conversation gave me great pleasure and much\r\n    information. The Count has moreover a black servant who speaks these\r\n    languages, having been bought by the Count during his long\r\n    residence in the East, and is now treated like one of the family. I\r\n    obtained much information which will be useful in my next edition of\r\n    the Physical Geography....\r\n\r\n                                        Your affectionate mother,\r\n                                                   MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    [After my mother's death, our old friend Count Miniscalchi made a\r\n    beautiful and touching \"éloge\" on her at a meeting of the Royal\r\n    Italian Geographical Society, to a numerous audience assembled in\r\n    the great hall of the Collegio Romano at Rome.\r\n\r\n    My mother was an honorary member of this Society, besides which the\r\n    first gold medal granted by them was voted by acclamation to her.\r\n    Her Recollections continue as follows:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nFrom Colà we went to Turin, where I became personally acquainted with\r\nBaron Plana, Director of the Observatory. He had married a niece of the\r\nillustrious mathematician La Grange, who proved the stability of the\r\nsolar system. Plana, himself, was a very great analyst; his volume on\r\nthe Lunar Perturbations is a work of enormous labour. He gave me a copy\r\nof it and of all his works; for I continued to have friendly intercourse\r\nwith him as long as he lived. As soon as he heard of our arrival, he\r\ncame to take us out to drive. I never shall forget the beauty of the\r\nAlps, and the broad valley of the Po and Dora, deeply covered with\r\nsnow, and sparkling in bright sunshine. Another day the Baron took us to\r\na church, from the cupola of which a very long pendulum was swinging,\r\nthat we might see the rotation of the earth visibly proved by its action\r\non the pendulum, according to M. Foucault's experiment. He devoted his\r\ntime to get us established, and we found a handsome apartment in Casa\r\nCavour, and became acquainted with both the brothers to whom it\r\nbelonged. Count Camillo Cavour, then Minister of the Interior, was the\r\nonly great statesman Italy ever produced in modern times. His premature\r\ndeath is deplorably felt at the present day. He was a real genius, and\r\nthe most masterly act of his administration was that of sending an army\r\nto act in concert with the French and English in the Crimean war. By it\r\nhe at once gave Italy the rank of an independent European power, which\r\nwas the first step towards Italian unity. He was delightful and cheerful\r\nin society, and extremely beloved by his family and friends.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn spring we hired a villa on the Colline above Turin. The house was in\r\na garden, with a terrace, whence the ground sank rapidly to the plain;\r\nlow hills, clothed with chestnut forests, abounding in lilies of the\r\nvalley, surrounded us behind. The summer had been stormy, and one\r\nevening we walked on the terrace to look at the lightning, which was\r\nvery fine, illuminating the chain of Alps. By-and-by it ceased, and the\r\ndarkness was intense; but we continued to walk, when, to our surprise, a\r\npale bluish light rose in the Val di Susa, which gradually spread along\r\nthe summit of the Alps, and the tops of the hills behind our house; then\r\na column of the same pale blue light, actually within our reach, came\r\ncurling up from the slope close to the terrace, exactly as if wet weeds\r\nhad been burning. In about ten minutes the whole vanished; but in less\r\nthan a quarter of an hour the phenomena were repeated exactly as\r\ndescribed, and were followed by a dark night and torrents of rain. It\r\nwas a very unusual instance of what is known as electric glow; that is,\r\nelectricity without tension.\r\n\r\nOn our road to Genoa, we went to see some kind Piedmontese friends, who\r\nhave a château in the Monferrat, not many miles from Asti, where we left\r\nthe railroad. We had not gone many miles when the carriage we had hired\r\nwas upset, and, although nobody had broken bones, I got so severe a blow\r\non my forehead that I was confined to bed for nearly a month, and my\r\nface was black and blue for a much longer time. Nothing could equal the\r\nunwearied kindness of our friends during my illness.\r\n\r\nWhen I was able to travel, we went to Genoa for the winter, and lived on\r\nthe second floor of a large house on the Acqua Sola, and overlooking the\r\nsea. Here first began our friendship with the Marchesa Teresa Doria,\r\nwhose maiden name was Durazzo; in her youth one of the handsomest women\r\nin Genoa, a lady distinguished for her generous character and cultivated\r\nmind, and who fearlessly avowed her opinions at a time when it was a\r\nkind of disgrace to be called a Liberal. Her youngest son, Giacomo, has\r\ndevoted his life to the study of natural history, and his mother used\r\nall her influence to encourage and help him in a pursuit so unusual\r\namongst people of rank in this country. Later, he travelled in Persia\r\nfor two years, to make collections, and since then resided for a long\r\ntime in Borneo, and is now arranging a museum in his native city. The\r\nMarchesa has always been a warm and devoted friend to me and mine.\r\n\r\nIt was here that we got our dear old parrot Lory, who is still alive and\r\nmerry.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOur next move was to Florence, where we already knew many people. We had\r\na lease of a house in Via del Mandorlo, which had a small garden and a\r\nbalcony, where we often sat and received in the warm summer evenings. My\r\ndaughters had adorned it and the garden with rare creepers, shrubs, and\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nWe had a visit from our friend Gibson, as he passed through Florence on\r\nhis way to Switzerland. He told us the history of his early life, as\r\ngiven in his biography, and much that is not mentioned there. He was\r\ndevotedly attached to the Queen, and spoke of her in his simple manner\r\nas a charming lady.\r\n\r\nMiss Hosmer was travelling with Gibson, an American young lady, who was\r\nhis pupil, and of whose works he was very proud. He looked upon her as\r\nif she had been his daughter, and she took care of him; for he was\r\ncareless and forgetful when travelling. I have the sincerest pleasure in\r\nexpressing my admiration for Miss Hosmer, who has proved by her works\r\nthat our sex possesses both genius and originality in the highest\r\nbranches of art.\r\n\r\nIt was at Florence that I first met my dear friend and constant\r\ncorrespondent, Frances Power Cobbe. She is the cleverest and most\r\nagreeable woman I ever met with, and one of the best. There is a distant\r\nconnection between us, as one of her ancestors married a niece of Lord\r\nFairfax, the Parliamentary general, many of whose letters are in the\r\npossession of her family. A German professor of physiology at Florence\r\nroused public indignation by his barbarous vivisections, and there was a\r\ncanvass for a Memorial against this cruel practice. Miss Cobbe took a\r\nleading part in this movement, and I heartily joined, and wrote to all\r\nmy acquaintances, requesting their votes; among others, to a certain\r\nMarchese, who had published something on agriculture. He refused his\r\nvote, saying, \"Perhaps I was not aware that the present state of science\r\nwas one of induction.\" Then he went on explaining to me what \"induction\"\r\nmeant, &c., &c., which amused me not a little. It made my family very\r\nindignant, as they thought it eminently presumptuous, addressed to me by\r\na man who, though a good patriot and agriculturist, knew nothing\r\nwhatever about science, past or present. A good deal of political party\r\nspirit was brought into play in this instance, as is too often the case\r\nhere. It is not complimentary to the state of civilisation in Italy,\r\nthat in Russia and Poland, both of them very far behind her in many\r\nrespects, there should exist societies for the prevention of cruelty to\r\nanimals, to which all the most distinguished people have given their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n    [I rejoice to say that this stain on Italian civilisation is now\r\n    wiped away. My mother just lived to hail the formation of the\r\n    Società Protettrice degli Animali.--ED.]\r\n\r\nIn summer we sometimes made excursions to avoid the heat of Florence.\r\nOne year we went to Valombrosa and the convents of La Vernia, and\r\nCamaldoli, which are now suppressed. We travelled on mules or ponies, as\r\nthe mountain paths are impracticable to carriages. I was disappointed in\r\nValombrosa itself, but the road to it is beautiful. La Vernia is highly\r\npicturesque, there we remained two days, which I spent in drawing. The\r\ntrees round the convent formed a striking contrast to the arid cliffs we\r\nhad passed on the road. The monks were naturally delighted to see\r\nstrangers. They belonged to the order of St. Francis, and each in his\r\nturn wandered over the country begging and living on the industry of\r\nothers. We did not pay for our food and lodging, but left much more than\r\nan equivalent in the poor-box. Somerville slept in the convent, and we\r\nladies were lodged in the so-called _Foresteria_ outside; but even\r\nSomerville was not admitted into the _clausura_ at Camaldoli, for the\r\nmonks make a vow of perpetual silence and solitude. Each had his little\r\nseparate hut and garden, and some distance above the convent, on the\r\nslopes of the Apennines, they had an establishment called the _Eremo_,\r\nfor those who sought for even greater solitude. The people told us that\r\nin winter, when deep snow covers the whole place, wolves are often seen\r\nprowling about. Not far from the Eremo there is a place from whence\r\nboth the Mediterranean and the Adriatic can be seen.\r\n\r\nWe occasionally went for sea-bathing to Viareggio, which is built on a\r\nflat sandy beach. The loose sand is drifted by the wind into low\r\nhillocks, and bound together by coarse grass thickly coated with silex.\r\nAmong this and other plants a lovely white amaryllis, the _Pancratium\r\nMaritimum_, with a sweet and powerful perfume, springs up. We often\r\ntried to get the bulb, but it lay too deep under the sand. One evening\r\nwe had gone a long way in search of these flowers, and sat down to rest,\r\nthough it was beginning to be dark. We had not sat many minutes when we\r\nwere surrounded by a number of what we supposed to be bats trying to get\r\nat the flowers we had gathered, but at length we discovered that they\r\nwere enormous moths, which followed us home, and actually flew into the\r\nroom to soar over the flowers and suck the honey with their long\r\nprobosces. They were beautiful creatures with large red eyes on their\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOur life at Florence went on pretty much as usual when all at once\r\ncholera broke out of the most virulent kind. Multitudes fled from\r\nFlorence; often in vain, for it prevailed all through Tuscany to a great\r\nextent. The terrified people were kneeling to the Madonna and making\r\nprocessions, after which it was remarked that the number of cases was\r\ninvariably increased. The Misericordia went about in their fearful\r\ncostume, indefatigable in carrying the sick to the hospitals. The\r\ndevotion of that society was beyond all praise; the young and the old,\r\nthe artisan and the nobleman, went night and day in detachments carrying\r\naid to the sufferers, not in Florence only, but to Fiesole and the\r\nvillages round. We never were afraid, but we consulted Professor\r\nZanetti, our medical adviser, whether we should leave the town, which we\r\nwere unwilling to do, as we thought we should be far from medical\r\nassistance, and he said, \"By no means; live as usual, drive out as you\r\nhave always done, and make not the smallest change.\" We followed his\r\nadvice, and drove out every afternoon till near dark, and then passed\r\nthe rest of the evening with those friends who, like ourselves, had\r\nremained in town. None of us took the disease except one of our\r\nservants, who recovered from instant help being given.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Normanby was British minister at that time, and Lady\r\nNormanby and he were always kind and hospitable to us. At her house we\r\nbecame acquainted with Signora Barbieri-Nini, the celebrated\r\nopera-singer, who had retired from the stage, and lived with her\r\nhusband, a Sienese gentleman, in a villa not far from Villa Normanby.\r\nShe gave a musical party, to which she invited us. The music, which was\r\nentirely artistic, was excellent, the entertainment very handsome, and\r\nit was altogether very enjoyable. As we were driving home afterwards,\r\nlate at night, going down the hill, our carriage ran against one of the\r\ndead carts which was carrying those who had died that day to the\r\nburying-ground at Trespiano. It was horribly ghastly--one could\r\ndistinguish the forms of the limbs under the canvas thrown over the heap\r\nof dead. The burial of the poor and rich in Italy is in singular\r\ncontrast; the poor are thrown into the grave without a coffin, the rich\r\nare placed in coffins, and in full dress, which, especially in the case\r\nof youth and infancy, leaves a pleasant impression. An intimate friend\r\nof ours lost an infant, and asked me to go and see it laid out. The\r\ncoffin, lined with white silk, was on a table, covered with a white\r\ncloth, strewed with flowers, and with a row of wax lights on either\r\nside. The baby was clothed in a white satin frock, leaving the neck and\r\narms bare; a rose-bud was in each hand, and a wreath of rose-buds\r\nsurrounded the head, which rested on a pillow. Nothing could be\r\nprettier; it was like a sleeping angel.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nPio Nono had lost his popularity before he came to visit the Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany. The people received him respectfully, but without\r\nenthusiasm; nevertheless, Florence was illuminated in his honour. The\r\nDuomo, Campanile, and the old tower in the Piazza dei Signori were very\r\nfine, but the Lung' Arno was beautiful beyond description; the river was\r\nfull, and reflected the whole with dazzling splendour.\r\n\r\nI made the acquaintance of Signore Donati, afterwards celebrated for the\r\ndiscovery of one of the most brilliant comets of this century, whose\r\ncourse and changes I watched with the greatest interest. On one occasion\r\nI was accompanied by my valued friend Sir Henry Holland, who had come to\r\nFlorence during one of his annual journeys. I had much pleasure in\r\nseeing him again.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties ran very high in Florence; we sympathised with the\r\nLiberals, living on intimate terms with the chief of them. As soon as\r\nthe probability of war between Piedmont and Austria became known, many\r\nyoung men of every rank, some even of the highest families, hastened to\r\njoin as volunteers. The most sanguine long hoped that the Grand Duke\r\nmight remember that he was an Italian prince rather than an Austrian\r\narchduke, and would send his troops to join the Italian cause; but his\r\ndynasty was doomed, and he blindly chose the losing side. At last the\r\nAustrians crossed the Mincio, and the war fairly broke out, France\r\ncoming to the assistance of Piedmont. The enthusiasm of the Tuscans\r\ncould then no longer be restrained, and on the 27th April 1859, crowds\r\nof people assembled on the Piazza dell' Indipendenza, and raised the\r\ntri-coloured flag. The government, who, the day before, had warning of\r\nwhat was impending, had sent sealed orders to the forts of Belvedere and\r\ndel Basso, which, when opened on the eventful morning, were found to\r\ncontain orders for the bombardment of the town. This the officers\r\nrefused to do, after which the troops joined the popular cause. When\r\nthis order became generally known, as it soon did, it proved the last\r\nblow to the dynasty, although the most eminent and respected Liberals\r\nused their best efforts during the whole of the 27th to restore harmony\r\nbetween the Grand Duke and the people. They advised his immediate\r\nabdication in favour of his son, the Archduke Ferdinand, the\r\nproclamation of the Constitution, and of course insisted on the\r\nimmediate alliance with Piedmont as their principal condition. It was\r\nalready too late! All was of no avail, and in the evening, whilst we\r\nwere as usual at the Cascine, the whole Imperial family, accompanied by\r\nthe Austrian minister, and escorted by several of the Corps\r\nDiplomatique, drove round the walls from Palazzo Pitti to Porta San\r\nGallo unmolested amid a silent crowd, and crossing the frontier on the\r\nBologna road, bade farewell for ever to Tuscany. The obnoxious ministers\r\nwere also permitted to retire unnoticed to their country houses.\r\n\r\nThus ended this bloodless revolution; there was no disorder of any kind,\r\nwhich was due to the young men belonging to the principal families of\r\nFlorence, such as Corsini, Incontri, Farinola, and others, using their\r\ninfluence with the people to calm and direct them. Indeed, so quiet was\r\neverything that my daughters walked about the streets, as did most\r\nladies, to see what was going on; the only visible signs of the\r\nrevolution throughout the whole day were bands of young men with\r\ntri-coloured flags and cockades shouting national songs at the top of\r\ntheir voices. As I have said already, we took our usual drive to the\r\nCascine after dinner, and went to the theatre in the evening; the\r\nstreets were perfectly quiet, and next morning the people were at work\r\nas usual. Sir James Scarlett was our minister, and had a reception the\r\nevening after these events, where we heard many predictions of evil\r\nwhich never were fulfilled. The least of these was the occupation of\r\nFlorence by a victorious Austrian army. The Tuscan archdukes precluded\r\nall chance of a restoration by joining the Austrian army, and being\r\npresent at the battle of Solferino. At Florence a provisional\r\ngovernment was formed with Bettino Ricasoli at its head; a parliament\r\nassembled three times in the Sala dei Cinquecento, in the Palazzo\r\nVecchio, and voted with unanimity the expulsion of the House of\r\nLorraine, and the annexation of Tuscany to the kingdom of Italy. In the\r\nmeantime the French and Italian arms were victorious in Lombardy. As,\r\nhowever, it is not my intention to give an historical account of the\r\nrevolution of 1859, but merely to jot down such circumstances as came\r\nunder my own immediate notice, I shall not enter into any particulars\r\nregarding the well-known campaign which ended in the cession of Milan\r\nand Lombardy to Italy.\r\n\r\nWe were keenly interested in the alliance between the Emperor Napoleon\r\nand the King of Italy, in hopes the Quadrilateral would be taken, and\r\nVenice added to the Italian States. We had a map of Northern Italy\r\nspread on a table, and from day to day we marked the positions of the\r\ndifferent headquarters with coloured-headed pins. I can hardly describe\r\nour indignation when all at once peace was signed at Villafranca, and\r\nNapoleon received Nice and Savoy in recompense for his aid, which were\r\ngiven up to him without regard to the will of the people. When the peace\r\nwas announced in Tuscany it caused great consternation and disgust; the\r\npeople were in the greatest excitement, fearing that those rulers so\r\nobnoxious to them might by this treaty be again forced upon them; and it\r\nrequired the firm hand of Ricasoli to calm the people, and induce the\r\nKing to accept the annexation which had been voted without one\r\ndissentient voice.\r\n\r\nBaron Ricasoli had naturally many enemies amongst the Codini, or\r\nretrograde party. Hand-grenades were thrown against the door of his\r\nhouse, as also at those of other ministers, but without doing harm. One\r\nevening my daughters were dressing to go to a ball that was to take\r\nplace at the Palazzo delle Crocelle, close to us, in a street parallel\r\nto ours, when we were startled by a loud explosion. An attempt had been\r\nmade to throw a shell into the ball-room, which had happily failed. The\r\nstreets were immediately lined with soldiers, and the ball, which was\r\ngiven by the Ministers, as far as I recollect, took place.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, a large body of French troops, commanded by\r\nPrince Jerôme Napoleon, came to Florence, and were bivouacked in the\r\nCascine. The people in the streets welcomed them as deliverers from the\r\nAustrians, whose occupation of Tuscany, when first we came to reside in\r\nFlorence, was such a bitter mortification to them, and one of the causes\r\nof the unpopularity of the Grand Duke, whom they never forgave for\r\ncalling in the Austrian troops after 1848. The French camp was a very\r\npretty sight; some of the soldiers playing at games, some mending their\r\nclothes, or else cooking. They were not very particular as to what they\r\nate, for one of my daughters saw a soldier skin a rat and put it into\r\nhis soup-kettle.\r\n\r\nWe were invited by the Marchesa Lajatico, with whom we were very\r\nintimate, to go and see the entry of Victor Emmanuel into Florence from\r\nthe balcony of the Casa Corsini in the Piazza del Prato, where she\r\nresides. The King was received with acclamation: never was anything like\r\nthe enthusiasm. Flowers were showered down from every window, and the\r\nstreets were decorated with a taste peculiar to the Italians.\r\n\r\n    [I think the following extracts from letters written by my mother\r\n    during the year 1859 and the following, ever memorable in Italian\r\n    history, may not be unwelcome to the reader. My mother took the\r\n    keenest interest in all that occurred. Owing to the liberal opinions\r\n    she had held from her youth, and to which she was ever constant, all\r\n    her sympathies were with the Italian cause, and she rejoiced at\r\n    every step which tended to unite all Italy in one kingdom. She lived\r\n    to see this great revolution accomplished by the entry of Victor\r\n    Emmanuel into Rome as King of Italy; a consummation believed by most\r\n    politicians to be a wild dream of poets and hot-headed patriots, but\r\n    now realised and accepted as a matter of course. My mother had\r\n    always firm faith in this result, and it was with inexpressible\r\n    pleasure she watched its completion. Our intimacy with the leading\r\n    politicians both in Tuscany and Piedmont naturally added to our\r\n    interest. Ricasoli, Menabrea, Peruzzi, Minghetti, &c., we knew\r\n    intimately, as well as Camillo Cavour, the greatest statesman Italy\r\n    ever produced. No one who did not witness it can imagine the grief\r\n    and consternation his death occasioned, and of which my mother\r\n    writes in a letter dated June 19th, 1861.]\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _May 5th, 1859_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST W.,\r\n\r\n    Your letter of the 28th would have made me laugh heartily were we\r\n    not annoyed that you should have suffered such uneasiness on our\r\n    account; the panic in England is ridiculous and most unfounded. The\r\n    whole affair has been conducted with perfect unanimity and\r\n    tranquillity, so that there has been no one to fight with. The\r\n    Austrians are concentrated in Lombardy, and not in Tuscany, nor is\r\n    there any one thing to disturb the perfect peace and quietness which\r\n    prevail over the whole country; not a soul thinks of leaving\r\n    Florence. You do the greatest injustice to the Tuscans. From first\r\n    to last not a person has been insulted, not a cry raised against\r\n    anyone; even the obnoxious ministers were allowed to go to their\r\n    country houses without a word of insult, and troops were sent with\r\n    the Grand Duke to escort him and his family to the frontier. Martha\r\n    and Mary went all through the town the morning of the revolution,\r\n    which was exactly like a common festa, and we found the\r\n    tranquillity as great when we drove through the streets in the\r\n    afternoon. The same quiet still prevails, the people are at their\r\n    usual employments, the theatres and private receptions go on as\r\n    usual, and the provisional government is excellent. Everyone knew of\r\n    the revolution long before it took place and the quietness with\r\n    which it was to be conducted. I am grieved at the tone of English\r\n    politics; and trust, for the honour of the country and humanity,\r\n    that we do not intend to make war upon France and Sardinia. It would\r\n    be a disgrace and everlasting stigma to make a crusade against the\r\n    oppressed, being ourselves free. The people here have behaved\r\n    splendidly, and we rejoice that we have been here to witness such\r\n    noble conduct. No nation ever made such progress as the Tuscans have\r\n    done since the year '48. Not a word of republicanism, it has never\r\n    been named. All they want is a constitutional government, and this\r\n    they are quietly settling....\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _29th May, 1859_.\r\n\r\n    ... Everything is perfectly quiet here; the Tuscans are giving money\r\n    liberally for carrying on the war. We have bought quantities of old\r\n    linen, and your sisters and I spend the day in making lint and\r\n    bandages for the wounded soldiers; great quantities have already\r\n    been sent to Piedmont. Hitherto the war has been favourable to the\r\n    allied army. God grant that England may not enter into the contest\r\n    till the Austrians are driven out of Italy! After that point has\r\n    been gained, our honour would be safe. To take part with the\r\n    oppressors and maintain despotism in Italy would be infamous.\r\n    Tuscany is to be occupied by a large body of troops under the\r\n    command of Prince Napoleon. A great many are already encamped on the\r\n    meadows at the Cascine--fine, spirited, merry young men; many of\r\n    them have the Victoria medal. They are a thorough protection against\r\n    any attack by the Austrians, of which, however, there is little\r\n    chance, as they have enough to do in Lombardy. There is to be a\r\n    great affair this morning at nine o'clock; an altar is raised in the\r\n    middle of the camp, and the tricolour (Italian) flag is to be\r\n    blessed amidst salvoes of cannon. Your friend, Bettino Ricasoli, is\r\n    thought by far the most able and statesmanlike person in Tuscany; he\r\n    is highly respected. Martha and I dined with Mr. Scarlett, and met\r\n    ... who said if the Grand Duke had not been the most foolish and\r\n    obstinately weak man in the world, he might still have been on the\r\n    throne of Tuscany; but that now he has made that impossible by going\r\n    to Vienna and allowing his two sons to enter the Austrian army....\r\n    We have had a visit from Dr. Falconer, his two nieces and brother.\r\n    They had been spending the winter in Sicily, where he discovered\r\n    rude implements formed by man mixed with the bones of prehistoric\r\n    animals in a cave, so hermetically shut up that not a doubt is left\r\n    of a race of men having lived at a period far anterior to that\r\n    assigned as the origin of mankind. Similar discoveries have recently\r\n    been made elsewhere. Dr. Falkner had travelled much in the\r\n    Himalayas, and lived two years on the great plain of Tibet; the\r\n    account he gave me of it was most interesting. His brother had spent\r\n    fifteen years in Australia, so the conversation delighted me; I\r\n    learnt so much that was new. I am glad to hear that the Queen has\r\n    been so kind to my friend Faraday; it seems she has given him an\r\n    apartment at Hampton Court nicely fitted up. She went to see it\r\n    herself, and having consulted scientific men as to the instruments\r\n    that were necessary for his pursuits, she had a laboratory fitted up\r\n    with them, and made him a present of the whole. That is doing things\r\n    handsomely, and no one since Newton has deserved it so much.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _5th June, 1859_.\r\n\r\n    ... All is perfectly quiet; a large body of French troops are now in\r\n    Tuscany, and many more are expected probably to make a diversion on\r\n    this side of the Austrian army through Modena; but nothing is known;\r\n    the most profound secrecy is maintained as to all military\r\n    movements. Success has hitherto attended the allied army, and the\r\n    greatest bravery has been shown. The enthusiasm among the men\r\n    engaged is excessive, the King of Sardinia himself the bravest of\r\n    the brave, but exposes himself so much that the people are making\r\n    petitions to him to be more careful. The Zouaves called out in the\r\n    midst of the battle, \"Le roi est un Zouave!\" Prince Napoleon keeps\r\n    very quiet, and avoids shewing himself as much as possible. The\r\n    French troops are very fine indeed--young, gay, extremely civil and\r\n    well bred. The secrecy is quite curious; even the colonels of the\r\n    regiments do not know where they may be sent till the order comes:\r\n    so all is conjecture.... The young King of Naples seems to follow\r\n    the footsteps of his father; I hope in God that we may not protect\r\n    and defend him. How anxious we are to know what the House of Commons\r\n    will do! Let us hope they will take the liberal side; but the\r\n    conservative party seems to be increasing.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _22nd August, 1859_.\r\n\r\n    ... Public affairs go on admirably. A few weeks ago the elections\r\n    took place of the members of the Tuscan parliament with a calm and\r\n    tranquillity of which you have no idea. Every proprietor who pays 15\r\n    pauls of taxes (75 pence) has a vote. There are 180 members,\r\n    consisting of the most ancient nobility, the richest proprietors,\r\n    the most distinguished physicians and lawyers, and the most\r\n    respectable merchants. They hold their meetings in the magnificent\r\n    hall of the Palazzo Vecchio--the Sala Dei Cinquecento. The first two\r\n    or three days were employed in choosing a president &c., &c.; then a\r\n    day was named to determine the fate of the house of Lorraine. I\r\n    could not go, but Martha went with a Tuscan friend. There was no\r\n    speaking; the vote was by ballot, and each member separately went up\r\n    to a table before the president, and silently put his ball into a\r\n    large vase. Two members poured the balls into a tray, and on\r\n    examination, said, \"No division is necessary; they are _all_\r\n    black,\"--which was followed by long and loud cheering. They have\r\n    been equally unanimous in the Legations in Parma and Modena; and the\r\n    wish of the people is to form one kingdom of these four states under\r\n    an Italian prince, excluding all Austrians for ever. The union is\r\n    perfect, and the determination quiet but deep and unalterable. If\r\n    the Archduke is forced upon them, it must be by armed force, which\r\n    the French emperor will not likely permit, after the Archduke was\r\n    fool enough to fight against him at Solferino. All the four states\r\n    have unanimously voted union with Piedmont; but they do not expect\r\n    it to be granted. The destinies of Europe are now dependent on the\r\n    two emperors....\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _23rd April, 1860_.\r\n\r\n    You would have had this letter sooner, my dearest Woronzow, if I had\r\n    not been prevented from writing to you yesterday evening.... The\r\n    weather has been atrocious; deluges of rain night and day, and so\r\n    cold that I have been obliged to lay in a second supply of wood. The\r\n    only good day, and the only one I have been out, was that on which\r\n    the king arrived. It fortunately was fine, and the sight was\r\n    magnificent; quite worthy of so great an historical event. No\r\n    carriages were allowed after the guns fired announcing that the king\r\n    had left Leghorn; so we should have been ill off, had it not been\r\n    for the kindness of our friend the Marchesa Lajatico, who invited us\r\n    to her balcony, which is now very large, as they have built an\r\n    addition to their house for the eldest son and his pretty wife. We\r\n    were there some hours before the king arrived; but as all the\r\n    Florentine society was there, and many of our friends from Turin and\r\n    Genoa, we found it very agreeable. The house is in the Prato, very\r\n    near the gate the king was to enter. On each side of it stages were\r\n    raised like steps in an amphitheatre, which were densely crowded,\r\n    every window decorated with gaily-coloured hangings and the Italian\r\n    flag; the streets were lined with \"guardie civiche,\" and bands of\r\n    music played from time to time. The people shouted \"Evviva!\" every\r\n    time a gun was fired. In the midst of this joy, there appeared what\r\n    resembled a funeral procession--about a hundred emigrants following\r\n    the Venetian, Roman, and Neapolitan colours, all hung with black\r\n    crape; they were warmly applauded, and many people shed tears. They\r\n    went to the railway station just without the gate to meet the King,\r\n    and when they hailed him as \"_Rè d'Italia!_\" he was much affected.\r\n    At last he appeared riding a fine English horse, Prince Carignan on\r\n    one hand and Baron Ricasoli on his left, followed by a numerous\r\n    \"_troupe dorée_\" of generals and of his suite in gay uniforms and\r\n    well mounted. The King rides well; so the effect was extremely\r\n    brilliant. Then followed several carriages; in the first were Count\r\n    Cavour, Buoncompagni, and the Marchese Bartolommei. You cannot form\r\n    the slightest idea of the excitement; it was a burst of enthusiasm,\r\n    and the reception of Cavour was as warm. We threw a perfect shower\r\n    of flowers over him, which the Marchesa had provided for the\r\n    occasion; and her youngest son Cino, a nice lad, went himself to\r\n    present his bouquet to the King, who seemed quite pleased with the\r\n    boy. I felt so much for Madame de Lajatico herself.... I said to her\r\n    how kind I thought it in her to open her house; she burst into\r\n    tears, and said, though she was in deep affliction, she could not be\r\n    so selfish as not offer her friends the best position in Florence\r\n    for seeing what to many of them was the most important event in\r\n    their lives, as it was to her even in her grief. The true Italian\r\n    taste appeared to perfection in every street through which the\r\n    procession passed to the Duomo, and thence to the Palazzo Pitti.\r\n    Those who saw it declare nothing could surpass the splendour of the\r\n    cathedral when illuminated; but that we could not see, nor did we\r\n    see the procession again; it was impossible to penetrate the crowd.\r\n    They say there are 40,000 strangers in Florence.... I was much too\r\n    tired to go out again to see the illuminations and the fireworks on\r\n    the Ponte Carraja; your sisters saw it all, so I leave them to tell\r\n    you all about it. The King and Prince are terribly early; they and\r\n    Ricasoli are on horseback by _five_ in the morning; the King dines\r\n    at twelve, and never touches food afterwards, though he has a dinner\r\n    party of 60 or 80 every day at six.... Now, my dearest Woronzow, I\r\n    must end, for I do not wish to miss another post. I am really\r\n    wonderfully well for my age.\r\n\r\n                                        Your devoted mother,\r\n                                                  MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _19th June, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    ... Italy has been thrown into the deepest affliction by the death\r\n    of Cavour. In my long life I never knew any event whatever which\r\n    caused so universal and deep sorrow. There is not a village or town\r\n    throughout the whole peninsula which has not had a funeral service,\r\n    and the very poorest people, who had hardly clothes on their backs,\r\n    had black crape tied round their arm or neck. It was a state of\r\n    consternation, and no wonder! Every one felt that the greatest and\r\n    best man of this century has been taken away before he had\r\n    completely emancipated his country. All the progress is due to him,\r\n    and to him alone; the revolution has called forth men of much\r\n    talent, yet the whole are immeasurably his inferior in every\r\n    respect--even your friend, Ricasoli, who is most able, and the best\r\n    successor that can be found, is, compared with Cavour, as Tuscany to\r\n    Europe. Happily the sad loss did not occur sooner. Now things are so\r\n    far advanced that they cannot go back, and I trust that Ricasoli,\r\n    who is not wanting in firmness and moral courage, will complete what\r\n    has been so happily begun. I am sorry to say he is not in very good\r\n    health, but I trust he will not fall into the hands of the physician\r\n    who attended Cavour, and who mistook his disease, reduced him by\r\n    loss of blood, and then finding out his real illness, tried to\r\n    strengthen him when too late. There was a most excellent article in\r\n    the \"Times\" on the two statesmen.\r\n\r\n    [My mother's recollections continue thus:--]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOne night the moon shone so bright that we sent the carriage away, and\r\nwalked home from a reception at the Marchesa Ginori's. In crossing the\r\nPiazza San Marco, an acquaintance, who accompanied us, took us to the\r\nMaglio, which is close by, to hear an echo. I like an echo; yet there is\r\nsomething so unearthly in the aërial voice, that it never fails to raise\r\na superstitious chill in me, such as I have felt more than once as I\r\nread \"Ossian\" while travelling among our Highland hills in my early\r\nyouth. In one of the grand passes of the Oberland, when we were in\r\nSwitzerland, we were enveloped in a mist, through which peaks were dimly\r\nseen. We stopped to hear an echo; the response came clear and distinct\r\nfrom a great distance, and I felt as if the Spirit of the Mountain had\r\nspoken. The impression depends on accessory circumstances; for the roar\r\nof a railway train passing over a viaduct has no such effect.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI lost my husband in Florence on the 26th June, 1860.... From the\r\npreceding narrative may be seen the sympathy, affection, and confidence,\r\nwhich always existed between us....\r\n\r\n    [After what has already been said of the happiness my mother enjoyed\r\n    during the long years of their married life, it may be imagined what\r\n    grief was her's at my father's death after only three days' illness.\r\n    My mother's dear friend and correspondent, Miss F.P. Cobbe, wrote to\r\n    her as follows on this occasion:--]\r\n\r\n    \"I have just learned from a letter from Captain Fairfax to my\r\n    brother the great affliction which has befallen you. I cannot\r\n    express to you how it has grieved me to think that such a sorrow\r\n    should have fallen on you, and that the dear, kind old man, whose\r\n    welcome so often touched and gratified me, should have passed away\r\n    so soon after I had seen you both, as I often thought, the most\r\n    beautiful instance of united old age. His love and pride in you,\r\n    breaking out as it did at every instant when you happened to be\r\n    absent, gives me the measure of what his loss must be to your warm\r\n    heart.\"\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [The following letter from my mother, dated April, 1861, addressed to\r\n    her sister-in-law, was written after reading my grandfather's \"Life\r\n    and Times,\" the publication of which my father did not live to see.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO MRS. ELLIOT, OF ROSEBANK, ROXBURGHSHIRE.\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _28th April, 1861_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR JANET,--\r\n\r\n    I received the precious volume[14] you have so kindly sent to me\r\n    some days ago, but I have delayed thanking you for it till now\r\n    because we all wished to read it first. We are highly pleased, and\r\n    have been deeply interested in it. The whole tone of the book is\r\n    characteristic of your dear father; the benevolence,\r\n    warm-heartedness, and Christian charity which appeared in the whole\r\n    course of his life and ministry. That which has struck us all most\r\n    forcibly is the liberality of his sentiments, both religious and\r\n    political, at a time when narrow views and bigotry made it even\r\n    dangerous to avow them, and it required no small courage to do so.\r\n    He was far in advance of the age in which he lived; his political\r\n    opinions are those of the present day, his religious opinions still\r\n    before it. There are many parts of the book which will please the\r\n    general reader from the graphic description of the manners and\r\n    customs of the time, as well as the narrative of his intercourse\r\n    with many of the eminent men of his day. Your most dear father's\r\n    affectionate remembrance of me touches me deeply. I have but one\r\n    regret, dear Jenny, and that is that our dear William did not live\r\n    to see the accomplishment of what was his dying wish; but God's will\r\n    be done.... We are all much as usual: I am wonderfully well, and\r\n    able to write, which I do for a time every day. I do not think I\r\n    feel any difference in capacity, but I become soon tired, and then I\r\n    read the newspapers, some amusing book, or work.... Everything is\r\n    flourishing in Italy, and the people happy and contented, except\r\n    those who were employed and dependent on the former sovereigns, but\r\n    they are few in comparison; and now there is a fine army of 200,000\r\n    men to defend the country, even if Austria should make an attack,\r\n    but that is not likely at present. Rome is still the difficulty, but\r\n    the Pope must and soon will lose his temporal power, for the people\r\n    are determined it shall be so....\r\n\r\n                           I am, dear sister,\r\n                                Most affectionately yours,\r\n                                            MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    To MRS. ELLIOT, of Rosebank, Roxburghshire.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The Rev. P.

It was a real pleasure, and her\r\nvoice was as pure and silvery as when I first heard her, years before.\r\nAnother winter we spent at Turin. On returning to Spezia in the summer\r\nof 1861, the beautiful comet visible that year appeared for the first\r\ntime the very evening we arrived. On the following, and during many\r\nevenings while it was visible, we used to row in a small boat a little\r\nway from shore, in order to see it to greater advantage. Nothing could\r\nbe more poetical than the clear starlit heavens with this beautiful\r\ncomet reflected, nay, almost repeated, in the calm glassy water of the\r\ngulf. The perfect silence and stillness of the scene was very\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\nI was now unoccupied, and felt the necessity of having something to do,\r\ndesultory reading being insufficient to interest me; and as I had always\r\nconsidered the section on chemistry the weakest part of the connection\r\nof the \"Physical Sciences,\" I resolved to write it anew. My daughters\r\nstrongly opposed this, saying, \"Why not write a new book?\" They were\r\nright; it would have been lost time: so I followed their advice, though\r\nit was a formidable undertaking at my age, considering that the general\r\ncharacter of science had greatly changed. By the improved state of the\r\nmicroscope, an invisible creation in the air, the earth, and the water,\r\nhad been brought within the limits of human vision; the microscopic\r\nstructure of plants and animals had been minutely studied, and by\r\nsynthesis many substances had been formed of the elementary atoms\r\nsimilar to those produced by nature. Dr. Tyndall's experiments had\r\nproved the inconceivable minuteness of the atoms of matter; Mr. Gassiot\r\nand Professor Plücher had published their experiments on the\r\nstratification of the electric light; and that series of discoveries by\r\nscientific men abroad, but chiefly by our own philosophers at home,\r\nwhich had been in progress for a course of years, prepared the way for\r\nBunsen and Kirchhof's marvellous consummation.\r\n\r\nSuch was the field opened to me; but instead of being discouraged by its\r\nmagnitude, I seemed to have resumed the perseverance and energy of my\r\nyouth, and began to write with courage, though I did not think I should\r\nlive to finish even the sketch I had made, and which I intended to\r\npublish under the name of \"Molecular and Microscopic Science,\" and\r\nassumed as my motto, \"Deus magnus in magnis, maximus in minimis,\" from\r\nSaint Augustin.\r\n\r\nMy manuscript notes on Science were now of the greatest use; and we went\r\nfor the winter to Turin (1861-1862), where I could get books from the\r\npublic libraries, and much information on subjects of natural history\r\nfrom Professor De Filippi, who has recently died, much regretted, while\r\non a scientific mission to Japan and China, as well as from other\r\nsources. I subscribed to various periodicals on chemical and other\r\nbranches of science; the transactions of several of our societies were\r\nsent to me, and I began to write. I was now an old woman, very deaf and\r\nwith shaking hands; but I could still see to thread the finest needle,\r\nand read the finest print, but I got sooner tired when writing than I\r\nused to do. I wrote regularly every morning from eight till twelve or\r\none o'clock before rising. I was not alone, for I had a mountain\r\nsparrow, a great pet, which sat, and indeed is sitting on my arm as I\r\nwrite these lines.\r\n\r\nThe Marchese Doria has a large property at Spezia, and my dear friend\r\nTeresa Doria generally spent the evening with us, when she and I chatted\r\nand played Bézique together. Her sons also came frequently, and some of\r\nthe officers of the Italian navy. One who became our very good friend is\r\nCaptain William Acton, now Admiral, and for two years Minister of\r\nMarine; he is very handsome, and, what is better, a most agreeable,\r\naccomplished gentleman, who has interested himself in many branches of\r\nnatural history, besides being a good linguist. In summer the British\r\nsquadron, commanded by Admiral Smart, came for five weeks to Spezia. My\r\nnephew, Henry Fairfax, was commander on board the ironclad \"Resistance.\"\r\nNotwithstanding my age, I was so curious to see an ironclad that I went\r\nall over the \"Resistance,\" even to the engine-room and screw-alley. I\r\nalso went to luncheon on board the flagship \"Victoria,\" a three-decker,\r\nwhich put me in mind of olden times.\r\n\r\n    [The following extracts are from letters of my mother's, written in\r\n    1863 and 1865:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    SPEZIA, _12th May, 1863_.\r\n\r\n    How happy your last letter has made me, my dearest Woronzow, to hear\r\n    that you are making real progress, and that you begin to feel better\r\n    from the Bath waters.... Of your general health I had the very best\r\n    account this morning from your friend Colonel Gordon. I was most\r\n    agreeably surprised and gratified by a very kind and interesting\r\n    letter from him, enclosing his photograph, and giving me an account\r\n    of his great works at Portsmouth with reference to the defence by\r\n    iron as well as stone....\r\n\r\n    I wish I could show you the baskets full of flowers which Martha and\r\n    Mary bring to me from the mountains. They are wonderfully beautiful;\r\n    it is one of my greatest amusements putting them in water. I quite\r\n    regret when they cannot go for them. The orchises and the gladioles\r\n    are the chief flowers now, but such a variety and such colours! You\r\n    see we have our quiet pleasures. I often think of more than \"60\r\n    years ago,\" when I used to scramble over the Bin at Burntisland\r\n    after our tods-tails and leddies-fingers, but I fear there is hardly\r\n    a wild spot existing now in the lowlands of Scotland....\r\n\r\n                                    God bless you, my dearest Woronzow.\r\n\r\n    FROM MRS. SOMERVILLE TO W. GREIG, ESQ.\r\n\r\n    SPEZIA, _27th Sept., 1865_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST WORONZOW,\r\n\r\n    I fear Agnes and you must have thought your old mother had gone mad\r\n    when you read M.'s letter. In my sober senses, however, though\r\n    sufficiently excited to give me strength for the time, I went over\r\n    every part of the _Resistance_,[15] and examined everything in\r\n    detail except the _stokehole_! I was not even hoisted on board, but\r\n    mounted the companion-ladder bravely. It was a glorious sight, the\r\n    perfection of structure in every part astonished me. A ship like\r\n    that is the triumph of human talent and of British talent, for all\r\n    confess our superiority in this respect to every other nation, and I\r\n    am happy to see that no jealousy has arisen from the meeting of the\r\n    French and English fleets. I was proud that our \"young admiral\"[16]\r\n    had the command of so fine a vessel.... I also spent a most\r\n    agreeable day on board the _Victoria_, three-decker, and saw every\r\n    part of the three decks, which are very different from what they\r\n    were in my father's time; everything on a much larger scale, more\r\n    elegant and convenient. But the greatest change is in the men; I\r\n    never saw a finer set, so gentlemanly-looking and well-behaved;\r\n    almost all can read and write, and they have an excellent library\r\n    and reading-room in all the ships. No sooner was the fleet gone than\r\n    the Italian Society of Natural History held their annual meeting\r\n    here, Capellini[17] being president in the absence (in Borneo) of\r\n    Giacomo Doria. There were altogether seventy members, Italian,\r\n    French, and German. I was chosen an Associate by acclamation, and\r\n    had to write a few lines of thanks. The weather was beautiful and\r\n    the whole party dined every day on the terrace below our windows,\r\n    which was very amusing to Miss Campbell and your sisters, who\r\n    distinctly heard the speeches. I was invited to dinner and the wife\r\n    of the celebrated Professor Vogt was asked to meet me; I declined\r\n    dining, as it lasted so long that I should have been too tired, but\r\n    I went down to the dessert. Capellini came for me, and all rose as I\r\n    came in, and every attention was shown me, my health was drank, &c.\r\n    &c. It lasted four days, and we had many evening visits, and I\r\n    received a quantity of papers on all subjects. I am working very\r\n    hard (for me at least), but I cannot hurry, nor do I see the need\r\n    for it. I write so slowly on account of the shaking of my hand that\r\n    although my head is clear I make little but steady progress....\r\n\r\n                                        Your affectionate mother,\r\n                                                  MARY SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Aspromonte, Garibaldi arrived a prisoner on board a\r\nman-of-war, and was placed at Varignano under surveillance. His wound\r\nhad not been properly dressed, and he was in a state of great suffering.\r\nMany surgeons came from all parts of Italy, and one even from England,\r\nto attend him, but the eminent Professor Nélaton saved him from\r\namputation, with which he was threatened, by extracting the bullet from\r\nhis ankle. I never saw Garibaldi during his three months' residence at\r\nVarignano and Spezia; I had no previous acquaintance with him;\r\nconsequently, as I could be of no use to him, I did not consider myself\r\nentitled to intrude upon him merely to gratify my own curiosity,\r\nalthough no one admired his noble and disinterested character more than\r\nI did. Not so, many of my countrymen, and countrywomen too, as well as\r\nladies of other nations, who worried the poor man out of his life, and\r\nmade themselves eminently ridiculous. One lady went so far as to collect\r\nthe hairs from his comb,--others showered tracts upon him.\r\n\r\nI had hitherto been very healthy; but in the beginning of winter I was\r\nseized with a severe illness which, though not immediately dangerous,\r\nlasted so long, that it was doubtful whether I should have stamina to\r\nrecover. It was a painful and fatiguing time to my daughters. They were\r\nquite worn out with nursing me; our maid was ill, and our man-servant,\r\nLuigi Lucchesi, watched me with such devotion that he sat up twenty-four\r\nnights with me. He has been with us eighteen years, and now that I am\r\nold and feeble, he attends me with unceasing kindness. It is but justice\r\nto say that we never were so faithfully or well served as by Italians;\r\nand none are more ingenious in turning their hands to anything, and in\r\nnever objecting to do this or that, as not what they were hired for,--a\r\ngreat quality for people who, like ourselves, keep few servants. After a\r\ntime they identify themselves with the family they serve, as my faithful\r\nLuigi has done with all his heart. I am sincerely attached to him.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn the spring, when I had recovered, my son and his wife came to Spezia,\r\nand we all went to Florence, where we had the pleasure of seeing many\r\nold friends. We returned to Spezia, and my son and his wife left us to\r\ngo back to England, intending to meet us again somewhere the following\r\nspring. I little thought we never should meet again.... My son sent his\r\nsisters a beautiful little cutter, built by Mr. Forrest in London, which\r\nhas been a great resource to them. I always insist on their taking a\r\ngood sailor with them, although I am not in the least nervous for their\r\nsafety. Indeed, small as the \"Frolic\" is--and she is only about\r\ntwenty-eight feet from stem to stern--she has weathered some stiff gales\r\ngallantly, as, for instance, when our friend, Mr. Montague Brown,\r\nBritish consul at Genoa, sailed her from Genoa to Spezia in very bad\r\nweather; and in a very dangerous squall my daughters were caught in,\r\ncoming from Amalfi to Sorrento. The \"Frolic\" had only just arrived at\r\nSpezia, when we heard of the sudden death of my dear son, Oct., 1865.\r\n\r\n    [This event, which took from my mother's last years one of her chief\r\n    delights, she bore with her usual calm courage, looking forward\r\n    confidently to a reunion at no distant date with one who had been\r\n    the most dutiful of sons and beloved of friends. She never permitted\r\n    herself, in writing her Recollections, to refer to her feelings\r\n    under these great sorrows.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSome time after this, my widowed daughter-in-law spent a few months with\r\nus. On her return to London, I sent the manuscript of the \"Molecular and\r\nMicroscopic Science\" with her for publication. In writing this book I\r\nmade a great mistake, and repent it. Mathematics are the natural bent of\r\nmy mind. If I had devoted myself exclusively to that study, I might\r\nprobably have written something useful, as a new era had begun in that\r\nscience. Although I got \"Chasles on the Higher Geometry,\" it could be\r\nbut a secondary object while I was engaged in writing a popular book.\r\nSubsequently, it became a source of deep interest and occupation to me.\r\n\r\nSpezia is very much spoilt by the works in progress for the arsenal,\r\nthough nothing can change the beauty of the gulf as seen from our\r\nwindows, especially the group of the Carrara mountains, with fine peaks\r\nand ranges of hills, becoming more and more verdant down to the water's\r\nedge. The effect of the setting-sun on this group is varied and\r\nbrilliant beyond belief. Even I, in spite of my shaking hand, resumed\r\nthe brush, and painted a view of the ruined Castle of Ostia, at the\r\nmouth of the Tiber, from a sketch of my own, for my dear friend Teresa\r\nDoria.\r\n\r\nWe now came to live at Naples; and on leaving Spezia, I spent a\r\nfortnight with Count and Countess Usedom at the Villa Capponi, near\r\nFlorence, where, though unable to visit, I had the pleasure of seeing my\r\nFlorentine friends again.\r\n\r\nWe spent two days in Rome, and dined with our friends the Duca and\r\nDuchesa di Sermoneta. We were grieved at his blindness, but found him as\r\nagreeable as ever.\r\n\r\nThrough our friend, Admiral Acton, I became acquainted with Professor\r\nPanceri, Professor of Comparative Anatomy; Signore de Gasparis, who has\r\ndiscovered nine of the minor planets, and is an excellent mathematician,\r\nand some others. To these gentlemen I am indebted for being elected an\r\nhonorary member of the Accademia Pontoniana.\r\n\r\nWe were much interested in Vesuvius, which, for several months, was in a\r\nstate of great activity. At first, there were only volumes of smoke and\r\nsome small streams of lava, but these were followed by the most\r\nmagnificent projections of red hot stones and rocks rising 2,000 feet\r\nabove the top of the mountain. Many fell back again into the crater, but\r\na large portion were thrown in fiery showers down the sides of the cone.\r\nAt length, these beautiful eruptions of _lapilli_ ceased, and the lava\r\nflowed more abundantly, though, being intermittent and always issuing\r\nfrom the summit, it was quite harmless; volumes of smoke and vapour rose\r\nfrom the crater, and were carried by the wind to a great distance. In\r\nsunshine the contrast was beautiful, between the jet-black smoke and the\r\nsilvery-white clouds of vapour. At length, the mountain returned to\r\napparent tranquillity, though the violent detonations occasionally heard\r\ngave warning that the calm might not last long. At last, one evening, in\r\nNovember, 1868, when one of my daughters and I were observing the\r\nmountain through a very good telescope, lent us by a friend, we\r\ndistinctly saw a new crater burst out at the foot of the cone in the\r\nAtrio del Cavallo, and bursts of red-hot lapilli and red smoke pouring\r\nforth in volumes. Early next morning we saw a great stream of lava\r\npouring down to the north of the Observatory, and a column of black\r\nsmoke issuing from the new craters, because there were two, and assuming\r\nthe well-known appearance of a pine-tree. The trees on the northern edge\r\nof the lava were already on fire. The stream of lava very soon reached\r\nthe plain, where it overwhelmed fields, vineyards, and houses. It was\r\nmore than a mile in width and thirty feet deep. My daughters went up the\r\nmountain the evening after the new craters were formed; as for me, I\r\ncould not risk the fatigue of such an excursion, but I saw it admirably\r\nfrom our own windows. During this year the volcanic forces in the\r\ninterior of the earth were in unusual activity, for a series of\r\nearthquakes shook the west coast of South America for more than 2,500\r\nmiles, by which many thousands of the inhabitants perished, and many\r\nmore were rendered homeless. Slight shocks were felt in many parts of\r\nEurope, and even in England. Vesuvius was our safety-valve. The pressure\r\nmust have been very great which opened two new craters in the Atrio del\r\nCavallo and forced out such a mass of matter. There is no evidence that\r\nwater had been concerned in the late eruption of Vesuvius; but during\r\nthe whole of the preceding autumn, the fall of rain had been unusually\r\ngreat and continuous. There were frequent thunderstorms; and, on one\r\noccasion, the quantity of rain that fell was so great, as to cause a\r\nland-slip in Pizzifalcone, by which several houses were overwhelmed;\r\nand, on another occasion, the torrent of rain was so violent, that the\r\nRiviera di Chiaja was covered, to the depth of half a metre, with mud,\r\nand stones brought down by the water from the heights above. This\r\nenormous quantity of water pouring on the slopes of Vesuvius, and\r\npercolating through the crust of the earth into the fiery caverns, where\r\nvolcanic forces are generated, being resolved into steam, and possibly\r\naided by the expansion of volcanic gases, may have been a partial agent\r\nin propelling the formidable stream of lava which has caused such\r\ndestruction. We observed, that when lava abounded, the projection of\r\nrocks and lapilli either ceased altogether, or became of small amount.\r\nThe whole eruption ended in a shower of impalpable ashes, which hid the\r\nmountain for many days, and which were carried to a great distance by\r\nthe wind. Sometimes the ashes were pure white, giving the mountain the\r\nappearance of being covered with snow. Vapour continued to rise from\r\nVesuvius in beautiful silvery clouds, which ceased and left the edge of\r\nthe crater white with sublimations. I owe to Vesuvius the great\r\npleasure of making the acquaintance of Mr. Phillips, Professor of\r\nGeology in the University of Oxford; and, afterwards, that of Sir John\r\nLubbock, and Professor Tyndall, who had come to Naples on purpose to see\r\nthe eruption. Unfortunately, Sir John Lubbock and Professor Tyndall were\r\nso limited for time, that they could only spend one evening with us; but\r\nI enjoyed a delightful evening, and had much scientific conversation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the progress meteorology has made since it became a\r\nsubject of exact observation, yet no explanation has been given of the\r\nalmost unprecedented high summer temperature of 1868 in Great Britain,\r\nand even in the Arctic regions. In England, the grass and heather were\r\ndried up, and extensive areas were set on fire by sparks from railway\r\nlocomotives, the conflagrations spreading so rapidly, that they could\r\nonly be arrested by cutting trenches to intercept their course. The\r\nwhalers found open water to a higher latitude than usual; but, although\r\nthe British Government did not avail themselves of this opportunity for\r\nfurther Arctic discovery, Sweden, Germany, France, and especially the\r\nUnited States, have taken up the subject with great energy. Eight\r\nexpeditions sailed for the North Polar region between the years 1868 and\r\n1870; several for the express purpose of reaching the Polar Sea, which,\r\nI have no doubt, will be attained, now that steam has given such power\r\nto penetrate the fields of floating ice. It would be more than a dashing\r\nexploit to make a cruise on that unknown sea; it would be a discovery of\r\nvast scientific importance with regard to geography, magnetism,\r\ntemperature, the general circulation of the atmosphere and oceans, as\r\nwell as to natural history. I cannot but regret that I shall not live to\r\nhear the result of these voyages.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe British laws are adverse to women; and we are deeply indebted to Mr.\r\nStuart Mill for daring to show their iniquity and injustice. The law in\r\nthe United States is in some respects even worse, insulting the sex, by\r\ngranting suffrage to the newly-emancipated slaves, and refusing it to\r\nthe most highly-educated women of the Republic.\r\n\r\n    [For the noble character and transcendent intellect of Mr. J.S. Mill\r\n    my mother had the greatest admiration. She had some correspondence\r\n    with him on the subject of the petition to Parliament for the\r\n    extension of the suffrage to women, which she signed; and she also\r\n    wrote to thank him warmly for his book on the \"Subjection of Women.\"\r\n    In Mr. Mill's reply to the latter he says:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM JOHN STUART MILL, ESQ., TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    BLACKHEATH PARK, _July 12th, 1869_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n    Such a letter as yours is a sufficient reward for the trouble of\r\n    writing the little book. I could have desired no better proof that\r\n    it was adapted to its purpose than such an encouraging opinion from\r\n    you. I thank you heartily for taking the trouble to express, in such\r\n    kind terms, your approbation of the book,--the approbation of one\r\n    who has rendered such inestimable service to the cause of women by\r\n    affording in her own person so high an example of their intellectual\r\n    capabilities, and, finally, by giving to the protest in the great\r\n    Petition of last year the weight and importance derived from the\r\n    signature which headed it.\r\n\r\n                          I am,\r\n                            Dear Madam,\r\n                               Most sincerely and respectfully yours,\r\n                                                             J.S. MILL.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAge has not abated my zeal for the emancipation of my sex from the\r\nunreasonable prejudice too prevalent in Great Britain against a literary\r\nand scientific education for women. The French are more civilized in\r\nthis respect, for they have taken the lead, and have given the first\r\nexample in modern times of encouragement to the high intellectual\r\nculture of the sex. Madame Emma Chenu, who had received the degree of\r\nMaster of Arts from the Faculty of Sciences of the University in Paris,\r\nhas more recently received the diploma of Licentiate in Mathematical\r\nSciences from the same illustrious Society, after a successful\r\nexamination in algebra, trigonometry, analytical geometry, the\r\ndifferential and integral calculus, and astronomy. A Russian lady has\r\nalso taken a degree; and a lady of my acquaintance has received a gold\r\nmedal from the same Institution.\r\n\r\nI joined in a petition to the Senate of London University, praying that\r\ndegrees might be granted to women; but it was rejected. I have also\r\nfrequently signed petitions to Parliament for the Female Suffrage, and\r\nhave the honour now to be a member of the General Committee for Woman\r\nSuffrage in London.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n    [My mother, in alluding to the great changes in public opinion which\r\n    she had lived to see, used to remark that a commonly well-informed\r\n    woman of the present day would have been looked upon as a prodigy of\r\n    learning in her youth, and that even till quite lately many\r\n    considered that if women were to receive the solid education men\r\n    enjoy, they would forfeit much of their feminine grace and become\r\n    unfit to perform their domestic duties. My mother herself was one of\r\n    the brightest examples of the fallacy of this old-world theory, for\r\n    no one was more thoroughly and gracefully feminine than she was,\r\n    both in manner and appearance; and, as I have already mentioned, no\r\n    amount of scientific labour ever induced her to neglect her home\r\n    duties. She took the liveliest interest in all that has been done of\r\n    late years to extend high class education to women, both classical\r\n    and scientific, and hailed the establishment of the Ladies' College\r\n    at Girton as a great step in the true direction, and one which could\r\n    not fail to obtain most important results. Her scientific library,\r\n    as already stated, has been presented to this College as the best\r\n    fulfilment of her wishes.]\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI have lately entered my 89th year, grateful to God for the innumerable\r\nblessings He has bestowed on me and my children; at peace with all on\r\nearth, and I trust that I may be at peace with my Maker when my last\r\nhour comes, which cannot now be far distant.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have been tried by many severe afflictions, my life upon the\r\nwhole has been happy. In my youth I had to contend with prejudice and\r\nilliberality; yet I was of a quiet temper, and easy to live with, and I\r\nnever interfered with or pryed into other people's affairs. However, if\r\nirritated by what I considered unjust criticism or interference with\r\nmyself, or any one I loved, I could resent it fiercely. I was not good\r\nat argument; I was apt to lose my temper; but I never bore ill will to\r\nany one, or forgot the manners of a gentlewoman, however angry I may\r\nhave been at the time. But I must say that no one ever met with such\r\nkindness as I have done. I never had an enemy. I have never been of a\r\nmelancholy disposition; though depressed sometimes by circumstances, I\r\nalways rallied again; and although I seldom laugh, I can laugh heartily\r\nat wit or on fit occasion. The short time I have to live naturally\r\noccupies my thoughts. In the blessed hope of meeting again with my\r\nbeloved children, and those who were and are dear to me on earth, I\r\nthink of death with composure and perfect confidence in the mercy of\r\nGod. Yet to me, who am afraid to sleep alone on a stormy night, or even\r\nto sleep comfortably any night unless some one is near, it is a fearful\r\nthought, that my spirit must enter that new state of existence quite\r\nalone. We are told of the infinite glories of that state, and I believe\r\nin them, though it is incomprehensible to us; but as I do comprehend, in\r\nsome degree at least, the exquisite loveliness of the visible world, I\r\nconfess I shall be sorry to leave it. I shall regret the sky, the sea,\r\nwith all the changes of their beautiful colouring; the earth, with its\r\nverdure and flowers: but far more shall I grieve to leave animals who\r\nhave followed our steps affectionately for years, without knowing for\r\ncertainty their ultimate fate, though I firmly believe that the living\r\nprinciple is never extinguished. Since the atoms of matter are\r\nindestructible, as far as we know, it is difficult to believe that the\r\nspark which gives to their union life, memory, affection, intelligence,\r\nand fidelity, is evanescent. Every atom in the human frame, as well as\r\nin that of animals, undergoes a periodical change by continual waste and\r\nrenovation; the abode is changed, not its inhabitant. If animals have no\r\nfuture, the existence of many is most wretched; multitudes are starved,\r\ncruelly beaten, and loaded during life; many die under a barbarous\r\nvivisection. I cannot believe that any creature was created for\r\nuncompensated misery; it would be contrary to the attributes of God's\r\nmercy and justice. I am sincerely happy to find that I am not the only\r\nbeliever in the immortality of the lower animals.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWhen I was taught geography by the village schoolmaster at Burntisland,\r\nit seemed to me that half the world was _terra incognita_, and now that\r\na new edition of my \"Physical Geography\" is required, it will be a work\r\nof great labour to bring it up to the present time. The discoveries in\r\nSouth Africa alone would fill a volume. Japan and China have been opened\r\nto Europeans since my last edition. The great continent of Australia was\r\nan entirely unknown country, except part of the coast. Now telegrams\r\nhave been sent and answers received in the course of a few hours, from\r\nour countrymen throughout that mighty empire, and even from New Zealand,\r\nround half the globe. The inhabitants of the United States are our\r\noffspring; so whatever may happen to Great Britain in the course of\r\nevents, it still will have the honour of colonizing, and consequently\r\ncivilizing, half the world.\r\n\r\nIn all recent geographical discoveries, our Royal Geographical Society\r\nhas borne the most important part, and none of its members have done\r\nmore than my highly-gifted friend the President, Sir Roderick Murchison,\r\ngeologist of Russia, and founder and author of the colossal \"Silurian\r\nSystem.\" To the affection of this friend, sanctioned by the unanimous\r\napproval of the council of that illustrious Society, I owe the honour of\r\nbeing awarded the Victoria Medal for my \"Physical Geography.\" An honour\r\nso unexpected, and so far beyond my merit, surprised and affected me\r\nmore deeply than I can find words to express.\r\n\r\nIn the events of my life it may be seen how much I have been honoured by\r\nthe scientific societies and universities of Italy, many of whom have\r\nelected me an honorary member or associate; but the greatest honour I\r\nhave received in Italy has been the gift of the first gold medal\r\nhitherto awarded by the Geographical Society at Florence, and which was\r\ncoined on purpose, with my name on the reverse. I received it the other\r\nday, accompanied by the following letter from General Menabrea,\r\nPresident of the Council, himself a distinguished mathematician and\r\nphilosopher:--\r\n\r\n    FROM GENERAL MENABREA TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    FLORENCE, _30 Juin, 1869_.\r\n\r\n    MADAME,\r\n\r\n    J'ai pris connaissance avec le plus grand intérêt de la belle\r\n    édition de votre dernier ouvrage sur la Géographie Physique, et je\r\n    désire vous donner un témoignage d'haute estime pour vos travaux. Je\r\n    vous prie donc, Madame, d'accepter une médaille d'or à l'effigie du\r\n    Roi Victor Emmanuel, mon auguste souverain. C'est un souvenir de mon\r\n    pays dans lequel vous comptez, comme chez toutes les nations où la\r\n    science est honoré, de nombreux amis et admirateurs. Veuillez\r\n    croire, Madame, que je ne cesserai d'être l'un et l'autre en même\r\n    temps que je suis,\r\n\r\n                             Votre très dévoué Serviteur,\r\n                                                       MENABREA.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt a general assembly of the Italian Geographical Society, at Florence,\r\non the 14th March, 1870, I was elected by acclamation an Honorary\r\nAssociate of that distinguished society. I am indebted to the President,\r\nthe Commendatore Negri, for having proposed my name, and for a very\r\nkind letter, informing me of the honour conferred upon me.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI have still (in 1869) the habit of studying in bed from eight in the\r\nmorning till twelve or one o'clock; but, I am left solitary; for I have\r\nlost my little bird who was my constant companion for eight years. It\r\nhad both memory and intelligence, and such confidence in me as to sleep\r\nupon my arm while I was writing. My daughter, to whom it was much\r\nattached, coming into my room early, was alarmed at its not flying to\r\nmeet her, as it generally did, and at last, after a long search, the\r\npoor little creature was found drowned in the jug.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th October, while at dinner, we had a shock of earthquake. The\r\nvibrations were nearly north and south; it lasted but a few seconds, and\r\nwas very slight; but in Calabria, &c., many villages and towns were\r\noverthrown, and very many people perished. The shocks were repeated\r\nagain and again; only one was felt at Naples; but as it occurred in the\r\nnight, we were unconscious of it. At Naples, it was believed there would\r\nbe an eruption of Vesuvius; for the smoke was particularly dense and\r\nblack, and some of the wells were dried up.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI can scarcely believe that Rome, where I have spent so many happy\r\nyears, is now the capital of united Italy. I heartily rejoice in that\r\nglorious termination to the vicissitudes the country has undergone, and\r\nonly regret that age and infirmity prevent me from going to see Victor\r\nEmmanuel triumphantly enter the capital of his kingdom. The Pope's\r\nreliance on foreign troops for his safety was an unpardonable insult to\r\nhis countrymen.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe month of October this year (1870), seems to have been remarkable for\r\ndisplays of the Aurora Borealis. It seriously interfered with the\r\nworking of the telegraphs, particularly in the north of England and\r\nIreland. On the night of the 24th October, it was seen over the greater\r\npart of Europe. At Florence, the common people were greatly alarmed, and\r\nat Naples, the peasantry were on their knees to the Madonna to avert the\r\nevil. Unfortunately, neither I nor any of my family saw the Aurora; for\r\nmost of our windows have a southern aspect. The frequent occurrence of\r\nthe Aurora in 1870 confirms the already known period of maximum\r\nintensity and frequency, every ten or twelve years, since the last\r\nmaximum occurred in 1859.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The _Resistance_, ironclad, commanded by Captain\r\nChamberlayne, then absent on sick leave.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Captain Henry Fairfax, my mother's nephew, then Commander\r\non board the _Resistance_, senior officer in the absence of the\r\ncaptain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Professor of Geology at Bologna.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nECLIPSE--VISITS OF SCIENTIFIC MEN--LIFE AT NAPLES--DARWIN'S\r\nBOOKS--REMARKS ON CIVILIZATION--FINE AURORA BOREALIS--DEATH OF\r\nHERSCHEL--SUMMER AT SORRENTO--BILL FOR PROTECTION OF\r\nANIMALS--NINETY-SECOND YEAR--LETTER FROM PROFESSOR SEDGWICK--GRAND\r\nERUPTION OF VESUVIUS--LAST SUMMER AT SORRENTO, PLANTS FOUND\r\nTHERE--CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1870 was unusually cool; but the winter has been extremely\r\ngloomy, with torrents of rain, and occasionally such thick fogs, that I\r\ncould see neither to read nor to write. We had no storms during the hot\r\nweather; but on the afternoon of the 21st December, there was one of the\r\nfinest thunderstorms I ever saw; the lightning was intensely vivid, and\r\ntook the strangest forms, darting in all directions through the air\r\nbefore it struck, and sometimes darting from the ground or the sea to\r\nthe clouds. It ended in a deluge of rain, which lasted all night, and\r\nmade us augur ill for the solar eclipse next day; and, sure enough, when\r\nI awoke next morning, the sky was darkened by clouds and rain.\r\nFortunately, it cleared up just as the eclipse began; we were all\r\nprepared for observing it, and we followed its progress through the\r\nopening in the clouds till at last there was only a very slender\r\ncrescent of the sun's disc left; its convexity was turned upwards, and\r\nits horns were nearly horizontal. It was then hidden by a dense mass of\r\nclouds; but after a time they opened, and I saw the edge of the moon\r\nleave the limb of the sun. The appearance of the landscape was very\r\nlurid, but by no means very dark. The common people and children had a\r\nvery good view of the eclipse, reflected by the pools of water in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nMany of the astronomers who had been in Sicily observing the eclipse\r\ncame to see me as they passed through Naples. One of their principal\r\nobjects was to ascertain the nature of the corona, or bright white rays\r\nwhich surround the dark lunar disc at the time of the greatest\r\nobscurity. The spectroscope showed that it was decidedly auroral, but as\r\nthe aurora was seen on the dark disc of the moon it must have been due\r\nto the earth's atmosphere. Part of the corona was polarized, and\r\nconsequently must have been material; the question is, Can it be the\r\nethereal medium? A question of immense importance, since the whole\r\ntheory of light and colours and the resistance of Encke's comet depends\r\nupon that hypothesis. The question is still in abeyance, but I have no\r\ndoubt that it will be decided in the affirmative, and that even the\r\ncause of gravitation will be known eventually.\r\n\r\nAt this time I had the pleasure of a visit from Mr. Peirce, Professor of\r\nMathematics and Astronomy, in the Harvard University, U.S., and\r\nSuperintendent of the U.S. Coast Survey, who had come to Europe to\r\nobserve the eclipse. On returning to America he kindly sent me a\r\nbeautiful lithographed copy of a very profound memoir on linear and\r\nassociative algebra. Although in writing my popular books I had somewhat\r\nneglected the higher algebra, I have read a great part of the work; but\r\nas I met with some difficulties I wrote to Mr. Spottiswoode, asking his\r\nadvice as to the books that would be of use, and he sent me Serret's\r\n\"Cours d'Algèbre Supérieure,\" Salmon's \"Higher Algebra,\" and Tait on\r\n\"Quaternions;\" so now I got exactly what I wanted, and I am very busy\r\nfor a few hours every morning; delighted to have an occupation so\r\nentirely to my mind. I thank God that my intellect is still unimpaired.\r\nI am grateful to Professor Peirce for giving me an opportunity of\r\nexercising it so agreeably. During the rest of the day I have recourse\r\nto Shakespeare, Dante, and more modern light reading, besides the\r\nnewspapers, which always interested me much. I have resumed my habit of\r\nworking, and can count the threads of a fine canvas without spectacles.\r\nI receive every one who comes to see me, and often have the pleasure of\r\na visit from old friends very unexpectedly. In the evening I read a\r\nnovel, but my tragic days are over; I prefer a cheerful conversational\r\nnovel to the sentimental ones. I have recently been reading Walter\r\nScott's novels again, and enjoyed the broad Scotch in them. I play a few\r\ngames at Bézique with one of my daughters, for honour and glory, and so\r\nour evenings pass pleasantly enough.\r\n\r\nIt is our habit to be separately occupied during the morning, and spend\r\nthe rest of the day together. We are fond of birds and have several, all\r\nvery tame. Our tame nightingales sing very beautifully, but, strange to\r\nsay, not at night. We have also some solitary sparrows, which are, in\r\nfact, a variety of the thrush (Turdus cyaneus), and some birds which we\r\nrescued from destruction in spring, when caught and ill-used by the boys\r\nin the streets; besides, we have our dogs; all of which afford me\r\namusement and interest.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nMr. Murray has kindly sent me a copy of Darwin's recent work on the\r\n\"Descent of Man.\" Mr. Darwin maintains his theory with great talent and\r\nwith profound research. His knowledge of the characters and habits of\r\nanimals of all kinds is very great, and his kindly feelings charming. It\r\nis chiefly by the feathered race that he has established his law of\r\nselection relative to sex. The males of many birds are among the most\r\nbeautiful objects in nature; but that the beauty of nature is altogether\r\nirrelative to man's admiration or appreciation, is strikingly proved by\r\nthe admirable sculpture on Diatoms and Foraminifera; beings whose very\r\nexistence was unknown prior to the invention of the microscope. The Duke\r\nof Argyll has illustrated this in the \"Reign of Law,\" by the variety,\r\ngraceful forms and beautiful colouring of the humming birds in forests\r\nwhich man has never entered.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Darwin's book it is amusing to see how conscious the male birds\r\nare of their beauty; they have reason to be so, but we scorn the vanity\r\nof the savage who decks himself in their spoils. Many women without\r\nremorse allow the life of a pretty bird to be extinguished in order that\r\nthey may deck themselves with its corpse. In fact, humming birds and\r\nother foreign birds have become an article of commerce. Our kingfishers\r\nand many of our other birds are on the eve of extinction on account of a\r\ncruel fashion.\r\n\r\nI have just received from Frances Power Cobbe an essay, in which she\r\ncontroverts Darwin's theory,[18] so far as the origin of the moral sense\r\nis concerned. It is written with all the energy of her vigorous\r\nintellect as a moral philosopher, yet with a kindly tribute to Mr.\r\nDarwin's genius. I repeat no one admires Frances Cobbe more than I do. I\r\nhave ever found her a brilliant, charming companion, and a warm,\r\naffectionate friend. She is one of the few with whom I keep up a\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Murray I am indebted for a copy of Tylor's \"Researches on the\r\nEarly History of Mankind, and the Development of Civilization\"--a very\r\nremarkable work for extent of research, original views, and happy\r\nillustrations. The gradual progress of the prehistoric races of mankind\r\nhas laid a foundation from which Mr. Tylor proves that after the lapse\r\nof ages the barbarous races now existing are decidedly in a state of\r\nprogress towards civilization. Yet one cannot conceive human beings in a\r\nmore degraded state than some of them are still; their women are treated\r\nworse than their dogs. Sad to say, no savages are more gross than the\r\nlowest ranks in England, or treat their wives with more cruelty.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn the course of my life Paris has been twice occupied by foreign\r\ntroops, and still oftener has it been in a state of anarchy. I regret\r\nto see that La Place's house at Arcueil has been broken into, and his\r\nmanuscripts thrown into the river, from which some one has fortunately\r\nrescued that of the \"Mécanique Céleste,\" which is in his own\r\nhandwriting. It is greatly to the honour of French men of science that\r\nduring the siege they met as usual in the hall of the Institute, and\r\nread their papers as in the time of peace. The celebrated astronomer\r\nJanssen even escaped in a balloon, that he might arrive in time to\r\nobserve the eclipse of the 22nd November, 1870.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe had a most brilliant display of the Aurora on the evening of Sunday,\r\nthe 4th February, 1871, which lasted several hours. The whole sky from\r\neast to west was of the most brilliant flickering white light, from\r\nwhich streamers of red darted up to the zenith. There was also a lunar\r\nrainbow. The common people were greatly alarmed, for there had been a\r\nprediction that the world was coming to an end, and they thought the\r\nbright part of the Aurora was a piece of the moon that had already\r\ntumbled down! This Aurora was seen in Turkey and in Egypt.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI am deeply grieved and shaken by the death of Sir John Herschel, who,\r\nthough ten years younger than I am, has gone before me. In him I have\r\nlost a dear and affectionate friend, whose advice was invaluable, and\r\nhis society a charm. None but those who have lived in his home can\r\nimagine the brightness and happiness of his domestic life. He never\r\npresumed upon that superiority of intellect or the great discoveries\r\nwhich made him one of the most illustrious men of the age; but conversed\r\ncheerfully and even playfully on any subject, though ever ready to give\r\ninformation on any of the various branches of science to which he so\r\nlargely contributed, and which to him were a source of constant\r\nhappiness. Few of my early friends now remain--I am nearly left alone.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe went to pass the summer and autumn at Sorrento, where we led a very\r\nquiet but happy life. The villa we lived in was at a short distance from\r\nand above the town, quite buried in groves of oranges and lemons, beyond\r\nwhich lay the sea, generally calm and blue, sometimes stormy; to our\r\nleft the islands of Ischia and Procida, the Capo Miseno, with Baia,\r\nPozzuoli, and Posilipo; exactly opposite to us, Naples, then Vesuvius,\r\nand all the little towns on that coast, and lastly, to our right, this\r\nwonderful panorama was bounded by the fine cliffs of the Monte\r\nSantangelo. It was beautiful always, but most beautiful when the sun,\r\nsetting behind Ischia, sent a perfect glory over the rippling sea, and\r\ntinged the Monte Santangelo and the cliffs which bound the Piano di\r\nSorrento literally with purple and gold. I spent the whole day on a\r\ncharming terrace sheltered from the sun, and there we dined and passed\r\nthe evening watching the lights of Naples reflected in the water and the\r\nrevolving lights of the different lighthouses. I often drove to Massa\r\ntill after sunset, for from that road I could see the island of Capri,\r\nand I scarcely know a more lovely drive. Besides the books we took with\r\nus we had newspapers, reviews, and other periodicals, so that we were\r\nnever dull. On one occasion my daughters and I made an expedition up the\r\nhills to the Deserto, from whence one can see the Gulf of Salerno and\r\nthe fine mountains of Calabria. My daughters rode and I was carried in a\r\n_portantina_. It was fine, clear, autumnal weather, and I enjoyed my\r\nexpedition immensely, nor was I fatigued.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn November we returned to Naples, where I resumed my usual life. I had\r\nreceived a copy of Hamilton's Lectures on Quaternions from the Rev.\r\nWhitewell Elwin. I am not acquainted with that gentleman, and am the\r\nmore grateful to him. I have now a valuable library of scientific books\r\nand transactions of scientific societies, the greater part gifts from\r\nthe authors.\r\n\r\nForeigners were so much shocked at the atrocious cruelty to animals in\r\nItaly, that an attempt was made about eight years ago to induce the\r\nItalian Parliament to pass a law for their protection, but it failed. As\r\nItaly is the only civilized country in Europe in which animals are not\r\nprotected by law, another attempt is now being made; I have willingly\r\ngiven my name, and I received a kind letter from the Marchioness of Ely,\r\nfrom Rome, to whom I had spoken upon the subject at Naples, telling me\r\nthat the Princess Margaret, Crown Princess of Italy, had been induced to\r\nhead the petition. Unless the educated classes take up the cause one\r\ncannot hope for much change for a long time. Our friend, Mr. Robert Hay,\r\nwho resided at Rome for many years, had an old horse of which he was\r\nvery fond, and on leaving Rome asked a Roman prince, who had very large\r\npossessions in the Campagna, if he would allow his old horse to end his\r\ndays on his grassy meadows. \"Certainly,\" replied the prince, \"but how\r\ncan you care what becomes of an animal when he is no longer of use?\" We\r\nEnglish cannot boast of humanity, however, as long as our sportsmen\r\nfind pleasure in shooting down tame pigeons as they fly terrified out of\r\na cage.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI am now in my 92nd year (1872), still able to drive out for several\r\nhours; I am extremely deaf, and my memory of ordinary events, and\r\nespecially of the names of people, is failing, but not for mathematical\r\nand scientific subjects. I am still able to read books on the higher\r\nalgebra for four or five hours in the morning, and even to solve the\r\nproblems. Sometimes I find them difficult, but my old obstinacy remains,\r\nfor if I do not succeed to-day, I attack them again on the morrow. I\r\nalso enjoy reading about all the new discoveries and theories in the\r\nscientific world, and on all branches of science.\r\n\r\nSir Roderick Murchison has passed away, honoured by all, and of undying\r\nfame; and my amiable friend, almost my contemporary, Professor Sedgwick,\r\nhas been obliged to resign his chair of geology at Cambridge, from age,\r\nwhich he had filled with honour during a long life.\r\n\r\n    [The following letter from her valued friend Professor Sedgwick, in\r\n    1869, is the last my mother received from him:--]\r\n\r\n    FROM PROFESSOR SEDGWICK TO MRS. SOMERVILLE.\r\n\r\n    CAMBRIDGE, _April 21st, 1869_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. SOMERVILLE,\r\n\r\n    I heard, when I was in London, that you were still in good bodily\r\n    health, and in full fruition of your great intellectual strength,\r\n    while breathing the sweet air of Naples. I had been a close prisoner\r\n    to my college rooms through the past winter and spring; but I broke\r\n    from my prison-house at the beginning of this month, that I might\r\n    consult my oculist, and meet my niece on her way to Italy.... My\r\n    niece has for many years (ever since 1840) been my loving companion\r\n    during my annual turn of residence as canon of Norwich; and she is,\r\n    and from her childhood has, been to me as a dear daughter. I know\r\n    you will forgive me for my anxiety to hear from a living witness\r\n    that you are well and happy in the closing days of your honoured\r\n    life; and for my longing desire that my beloved daughter (for such I\r\n    ever regard her) should speak to you face to face, and see (for\r\n    however short an interview) the Mrs. Somerville, of whom I have so\r\n    often talked with her in terms of honest admiration and deep regard.\r\n    The time for the Italian tour is, alas! far too short. But it will\r\n    be a great gain to each of the party to be allowed, even for a short\r\n    time, to gaze upon the earthly paradise that is round about you, and\r\n    to cast one look over its natural wonders and historic monuments....\r\n    Since you were here, my dear and honoured guest, Cambridge is\r\n    greatly changed. I am left here like a vessel on its beam ends, to\r\n    mark the distance to which the current has been drifting during a\r\n    good many bygone years. I have outlived nearly all my early\r\n    friends. Whewell, Master of Trinity, was the last of the old stock\r\n    who was living here. Herschel has not been here for several years.\r\n    Babbage was here for a day or two during the year before last. The\r\n    Astronomer-Royal belongs to a more recent generation. For many years\r\n    long attacks of suppressed gout have made my life very unproductive.\r\n    I yesterday dined in Hall. It was the first time I was able to meet\r\n    my brother Fellows since last Christmas day. A long attack of\r\n    bronchitis, followed by a distressing inflammation of my eyes, had\r\n    made me a close prisoner for nearly four months. But, thank God, I\r\n    am again beginning to be cheery, and with many infirmities (the\r\n    inevitable results of old age, for I have entered on my 85th year) I\r\n    am still strong in general health, and capable of enjoying, I think\r\n    as much as ever, the society of those whom I love, be they young or\r\n    old. May God preserve and bless you; and whensoever it may be His\r\n    will to call you away to Himself, may your mind be without a cloud\r\n    and your heart full of joyful Christian hope!\r\n\r\n                               I remain,\r\n                                  My dear Friend,\r\n                                     Faithfully and gratefully yours,\r\n                                                        ADAM SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAfter all the violence and bloodshed of the preceding year, the\r\nThanksgiving of Queen Victoria and the British nation for the recovery\r\nof the Prince of Wales will form a striking event in European history.\r\nFor it was not the congregation in St. Paul's alone, it was the\r\nspontaneous gratitude of all ranks and all faiths throughout the three\r\nkingdoms that were offered up to God that morning; the people\r\nsympathized with their Queen, and no sovereign more deserves sympathy.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nVesuvius has exhibited a considerable activity during the winter and\r\nearly spring, and frequent streams of lava flowed from the crater, and\r\nespecially from the small cone to the north, a little way below the\r\nprincipal crater. But these streams were small and intermittent, and no\r\ngreat outbreak was expected. On the 24th April a stream of lava induced\r\nus to drive in the evening to Santa Lucia. The next night, Thursday,\r\n25th April, my daughter Martha, who had been to the theatre, wakened me\r\nthat I might see Vesuvius in splendid eruption. This was at about 1\r\no'clock on Friday morning. Early in the morning I was disturbed by what\r\nI thought loud thunder, and when my maid came at 7 a.m. I remarked that\r\nthere was a thunder storm, but she said, \"No, no; it is the mountain\r\nroaring.\" It must have been very loud for me to hear, considering my\r\ndeafness, and the distance Vesuvius is from Naples, yet it was nothing\r\ncompared to the noise later in the day, and for many days after. My\r\ndaughter, who had gone to Santa Lucia to see the eruption better, soon\r\ncame to fetch me with our friend Mr. James Swinton, and we passed the\r\nwhole day at windows in an hotel at Santa Lucia, immediately opposite\r\nthe mountain. Vesuvius was now in the fiercest eruption, such as has not\r\noccurred in the memory of this generation, lava overflowing the\r\nprincipal crater and running in all directions. The fiery glow of lava\r\nis not very visible by daylight; smoke and steam is sent off which rises\r\nwhite as snow, or rather as frosted silver, and the mouth of the great\r\ncrater was white with the lava pouring over it. New craters had burst\r\nout the preceding night, at the very time I was admiring the beauty of\r\nthe eruption, little dreaming that, of many people who had gone up that\r\nnight to the Atrio del Cavallo to see the lava (as my daughters had done\r\nrepeatedly and especially during the great eruption of 1868), some forty\r\nor fifty had been on the very spot where the new crater burst out, and\r\nperished, scorched to death by the fiery vapours which eddied from the\r\nfearful chasm. Some were rescued who had been less near to the chasm,\r\nbut of these none eventually recovered.\r\n\r\nBehind the cone rose an immense column of dense black smoke to more than\r\nfour times the height of the mountain, and spread out at the summit\r\nhorizontally, like a pine tree, above the silvery stream which poured\r\nforth in volumes. There were constant bursts of fiery projectiles,\r\nshooting to an immense height into the black column of smoke, and\r\ntinging it with a lurid red colour. The fearful roaring and thundering\r\nnever ceased for one moment, and the house shook with the concussion of\r\nthe air. One stream of lava flowed towards Torre del Greco, but luckily\r\nstopped before it reached the cultivated fields; others, and the most\r\ndangerous ones, since some of them came from the new craters, poured\r\ndown the Atrio del Cavallo, and dividing before reaching the Observatory\r\nflowed to the right and to the left--the stream which flowed to the\r\nnorth very soon reached the plain, and before night came on had\r\npartially destroyed the small town of Massa di Somma. One of the\r\npeculiarities of this eruption was the great fluidity of the lava;\r\nanother was the never-ceasing thundering of the mountain. During that\r\nday we observed several violent explosions in the great stream of lava:\r\nwe thought from the enormous volumes of black smoke emitted on these\r\noccasions that new craters had burst out--some below the level of the\r\nObservatory; but that can hardly have been the case. My daughters at\r\nnight drove to Portici, and went up to the top of a house, where the\r\nnoise seems to have been appalling; but they told me they did not gain\r\nanything by going to Portici, nor did they see the eruption better than\r\nI did who remained at Santa Lucia, for you get too much below the\r\nmountain on going near. On Sunday, 28th, I was surprised at the extreme\r\ndarkness, and on looking out of window saw men walking with umbrellas;\r\nVesuvius was emitting such an enormous quantity of ashes, or rather fine\r\nblack sand, that neither land, sea, nor sky was visible; the fall was a\r\nlittle less dense during the day, but at night it was worse than ever.\r\nStrangers seemed to be more alarmed at this than at the eruption, and\r\ncertainly the constant loud roaring of Vesuvius was appalling enough\r\namidst the darkness and gloom of the falling ashes. The railroad was\r\ncrowded with both natives and foreigners, escaping; on the other hand,\r\ncrowds came from Rome to see the eruption. We were not at all afraid,\r\nfor we considered that the danger was past when so great an eruption had\r\nacted as a kind of safety-valve to the pent-up vapours. But a silly\r\nreport got about that an earthquake was to take place, and many persons\r\npassed the night in driving or walking about the town, avoiding narrow\r\nstreets. The mountain was quite veiled for some days by vapour and\r\nashes, but I could see the black smoke and silvery mass above it. While\r\nlooking at this, a magnificent column, black as jet, darted with\r\ninconceivable violence and velocity to an immense height; it gave a\r\ngrand idea of the power that was still in action in the fiery caverns\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nImmense injury has been done by this eruption, and much more would have\r\nbeen done had not the lava flowed to a great extent over that of 1868.\r\nStill the streams ran through Massa di Somma, San Sebastiano, and other\r\nvillages scattered about the country, overwhelming fields, woods,\r\nvineyards, and houses. The ashes, too, have not only destroyed this\r\nyear's crops, but killed both vines and fruit trees, so that altogether\r\nit has been most disastrous. Vesuvius was involved in vapour and ashes\r\ntill far on in May, and one afternoon at sunset, when all below was in\r\nshade, and only a few silvery threads of steam were visible, a column of\r\nthe most beautiful crimson colour rose from the crater, and floated in\r\nthe air. Many of the small craters still smoked, one quite at the base\r\nof the cone, which is a good deal changed--it is lower, the small\r\nnorthern cone has disappeared, and part of the walls of the crater have\r\nfallen in, and there is a fissure in them through which smoke or vapour\r\nis occasionally emitted.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn the 1st June we returned to Sorrento, this time to a pretty and\r\ncheerful apartment close to the sea, where I led very much the same\r\npleasant life as the year before--busy in the morning with my own\r\nstudies, and passing the rest of the day on the terrace with my\r\ndaughters, who brought me beautiful wild flowers from their excursions\r\nover the country. Many of the flowers they brought were new to me, and\r\nit is a curious fact that some plants which did not grow in this part of\r\nthe country a few years ago are now quite common. Amongst others, the\r\nTrachelium coeruleum, a pretty wall-plant, native of Calabria, and\r\nformerly unknown here, now clothes many an old wall near Naples, and at\r\nSorrento. The ferns are extremely beautiful here. Besides those common\r\nto England, the Pteris cretica grows luxuriantly in the damp ravines, as\r\nwell as that most beautiful of European ferns, the Woodwardia radicans,\r\nwhose fronds are often more than six feet long. The inhabitants of\r\nSorrento are very superior to the Neapolitans, both in looks and\r\ncharacter; they are cleanly, honest, less cruel to animals, and have\r\npleasant manners--neither too familiar nor cringing. As the road between\r\nSorrento and Castellamare was impassable, owing to the fall of immense\r\nmasses of rock from the cliffs above it, we crossed over in the steamer\r\nwith our servants and our pet birds, for I now have a beautiful\r\nlong-tailed parroquet called Smeraldo, who is my constant companion and\r\nis very familiar. And here I must mention how much I was pleased to\r\nhear that Mr. Herbert, M.P., has brought in a bill to protect land\r\nbirds, which has been passed in Parliament; but I am grieved to find\r\nthat \"The lark which at Heaven's gate sings\" is thought unworthy of\r\nman's protection. Among the numerous plans for the education of the\r\nyoung, let us hope that mercy may be taught us a part of religion.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThough far advanced in years, I take as lively an interest as ever in\r\npassing events. I regret that I shall not live to know the result of the\r\nexpedition to determine the currents of the ocean, the distance of the\r\nearth from the sun determined by the transits of Venus, and the source\r\nof the most renowned of rivers, the discovery of which will immortalise\r\nthe name of Dr. Livingstone. But I regret most of all that I shall not\r\nsee the suppression of the most atrocious system of slavery that ever\r\ndisgraced humanity--that made known to the world by Dr. Livingstone and\r\nby Mr. Stanley, and which Sir Bartle Frere has gone to suppress by order\r\nof the British Government.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe Blue Peter has been long flying at my foremast, and now that I am in\r\nmy ninety-second year I must soon expect the signal for sailing. It is\r\na solemn voyage, but it does not disturb my tranquillity. Deeply\r\nsensible of my utter unworthiness, and profoundly grateful for the\r\ninnumerable blessings I have received, I trust in the infinite mercy of\r\nmy Almighty Creator. I have every reason to be thankful that my\r\nintellect is still unimpaired, and, although my strength is weakness, my\r\ndaughters support my tottering steps, and, by incessant care and help,\r\nmake the infirmities of age so light to me that I am perfectly happy.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI have very little more to add to these last words of my Mother's\r\nRecollections. The preceding pages will have given the reader some\r\nidea--albeit perhaps a very imperfect one--of her character and\r\nopinions. Only regarding her feelings on the most sacred of themes,\r\nis it needful for me to say a few words. My mother was profoundly\r\nand sincerely religious; hers was not a religion of mere forms and\r\ndoctrines, but a solemn deep-rooted faith which influenced every\r\nthought, and regulated every action of her life. Great love and\r\nreverence towards God was the foundation of this pure faith, which\r\naccompanied her from youth to extreme old age, indeed to her last\r\nmoments, which gave her strength to endure many sorrows, and was the\r\nmainspring of that extreme humility which was so remarkable a\r\nfeature of her character.\r\n\r\nAt a very early age she dared to think for herself, fearlessly\r\nshaking off those doctrines of her early creed which seemed to her\r\nincompatible with the unutterable goodness and greatness of God; and\r\nthrough life she adhered to her simple faith, holding quietly and\r\nresolutely to the ultimate truths of religion, regardless alike of\r\nthe censure of bigots or the smiles of sceptics. The theories of\r\nmodern science she welcomed as quite in accordance with her\r\nreligious opinions. She rejected the notion of occasional\r\ninterference by the Creator with His work, and believed that from\r\nthe first and invariably He has acted according to a system of\r\nharmonious laws, some of which we are beginning faintly to\r\nrecognise, others of which will be discovered in course of time,\r\nwhile many must remain a mystery to man while he inhabits this\r\nworld. It was in her early life that the controversy raged\r\nrespecting the incompatibility of the Mosaic account of Creation,\r\nthe Deluge, &c., with the revelations of geology. My mother very\r\nsoon accepted the modern theories, seeing in them nothing in any way\r\nhostile to true religious belief. It is singular to recall that her\r\ncandid avowal of views now so common, caused her to be publicly\r\ncensured by name from the pulpit of York Cathedral. She foresaw the\r\ngreat modifications in opinion which further discoveries will\r\ninevitably produce; but she foresaw them without doubt or fear. Her\r\nconstant prayer was for light and truth, and its full accomplishment\r\nshe looked for confidently in the life beyond the grave. My mother\r\nnever discussed religious subjects in general society; she\r\nconsidered them far too solemn to be talked of lightly; but with\r\nthose near and dear to her, and with very intimate friends, whose\r\nopinion agreed with her own, she spoke freely and willingly. Her\r\nmind was constantly occupied with thoughts on religion; and in her\r\nlast years especially she reflected much on that future world which\r\nshe expected soon to enter, and lifted her heart still more\r\nfrequently to that good Father whom she had loved so fervently all\r\nher life, and in whose merciful care she fearlessly trusted in her\r\nlast hour.\r\n\r\nMy mother's old age was a thoroughly happy one. She often said\r\nthat not even in the joyous spring of life had she been more truly\r\nhappy. Serene and cheerful, full of life and activity, as far as her\r\nphysical strength permitted, she had none of the infirmities of age,\r\nexcept difficulty in hearing, which prevented her from joining in\r\ngeneral conversation. She had always been near-sighted, but could\r\nread small print with the greatest ease without glasses, even by\r\nlamp-light. To the last her intellect remained perfectly unclouded;\r\nher affection for those she loved, and her sympathy for all living\r\nbeings, as fervent as ever; nor did her ardent desire for and belief\r\nin the ultimate religious and moral improvement of mankind diminish.\r\nShe always retained her habit of study, and that pursuit, in which\r\nshe had attained such excellence and which was always the most\r\ncongenial to her,--Mathematics--delighted and amused her to the end.\r\nHer last occupations, continued to the actual day of her death, were\r\nthe revision and completion of a treatise, which she had written\r\nyears before, on the \"Theory of Differences\" (with diagrams\r\nexquisitely drawn), and the study of a book on Quaternions. Though\r\ntoo religious to fear death, she dreaded outliving her intellectual\r\npowers, and it was with intense delight that she pursued her\r\nintricate calculations after her ninetieth and ninety-first years,\r\nand repeatedly told me how she rejoiced to find that she had the\r\nsame readiness and facility in comprehending and developing these\r\nextremely difficult formulæ which she possessed when young. Often,\r\nalso, she said how grateful she was to the Almighty Father who had\r\nallowed her to retain her faculties unimpaired to so great an age.\r\nGod was indeed loving and merciful to her; not only did He spare her\r\nthis calamity, but also the weary trial of long-continued illness.\r\nIn health of body and vigour of mind, having lived far beyond the\r\nusual span of human life, He called her to Himself. For her Death\r\nlost all its terrors. Her pure spirit passed away so gently that\r\nthose around her scarcely perceived when she left them. It was the\r\nbeautiful and painless close of a noble and a happy life.\r\n\r\nMy mother died in sleep on the morning of the 29th Nov., 1872. Her\r\nremains rest in the English Campo Santo of Naples.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: \"Darwinism in Morals,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nBRADBURY, AGNEW, & CO., PRINTERS, WHITEFRIARS.",
