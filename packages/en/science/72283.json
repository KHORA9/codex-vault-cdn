D. 1813,\r\nWilliam Barton of the said district, hath deposited in this office the\r\nTitle of a book, the right whereof he claims as Author, in the words\r\nfollowing, to wit:\r\n\r\n“Memoirs of the Life of David Rittenhouse, L. L. D. F.R.S, late\r\n  President of the American Philosophical Society, &c. Interspersed with\r\n  various notices of many distinguished men: with an Appendix,\r\n  containing sundry philosophical and other papers, most of which have\r\n  not hitherto been published. By William Barton, M. A. Counsellor at\r\n  Law; Member of the American Philosophical Society, the Mass. Hist.\r\n  Society, and the Royal Economical Society of Valencia, in Spain.”\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the act of the Congress of the United States,\r\nintituled, “An act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the\r\ncopies of maps, charts and books, to the authors and proprietors of such\r\ncopies during the times therein mentioned.”—And also to the act\r\nentitled, “An act supplementary to an act, entitled, “An act for the\r\nencouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and\r\nbooks, to the authors and proprietors of such copies during the times\r\ntherein mentioned,” and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of\r\ndesigning, engraving, and etching historical and other prints.”\r\n\r\n                                            D. CALDWELL,\r\n                                  Clerk of the District of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph notes]\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the plan on which the following memoirs have been\r\nconducted, it will be perceived, that they contain a great variety of\r\nmatter; of which, some particulars have a remote, others merely an\r\nincidental connexion, with the chief object of the work. There may\r\nperhaps be some readers, to whom the introduction of such matters as the\r\n_University of Pennsylvania_ and the _Medical School_ connected with it,\r\nthe _Pennsylvania Hospital_, the _Philadelphia Library_, and the like,\r\ninto the _Life of Rittenhouse_, will, on a cursory view, seem to have\r\nlittle or no affinity to that object. But when it is considered, that\r\nthis work is designed to comprehend Memoirs, not only of Rittenhouse\r\npersonally, but of several literary, scientific, and other public\r\ninstitutions, as well as of many eminent men, with which his individual\r\nhistory and the annals of his time were in various ways associated, it\r\nis presumed, that the slight sketches which have been taken of those\r\nmatters, in passing along, will neither prove foreign to the nature of\r\nthe present undertaking, nor uninteresting in themselves. As a citizen\r\nof Pennsylvania; as an inestimable public and private character; as a\r\ndistinguished son of science, of great probity and extensive usefulness\r\nin society; in all these points of view, the History of Dr. Rittenhouse\r\nmay be contemplated, as holding a relationship with almost every object\r\nconnected with science and the arts, in his day, that could in any wise\r\ncontribute to the well being of mankind in general, and his native\r\ncountry in particular. Conspicuous and eminently meritorious as he was,\r\nyet an insulated account of his talents, his virtues, and his personal\r\nservices,—a bare specification of such qualities and merits as he\r\npossessed, abstracted from a due consideration of the state of society\r\nand circumstances resulting from it, taken in connexion with them,\r\nduring the same period,—would not be equally intelligible and\r\ninstructive; and, consequently, must prove less useful. For these\r\nreasons, the Memorialist has pursued that course which he conceives to\r\nbe perfectly congenial with the main design of his work; as best\r\ncalculated to promote its general usefulness, and most suitably adapted\r\nto render it interesting, even to those who read for amusement solely.\r\n\r\nIn the adoption of this plan, the writer has been chiefly influenced by\r\na desire to illustrate the history, genius and character of the times,\r\nwhich his Memoirs embrace; together with the progress and improvement of\r\nliterature, science and the arts, within the same compass, more\r\nespecially in this country; and this consideration has obviously led him\r\nto introduce, in conjunction with those objects, as well as with the\r\nLife of the great American Philosopher, various notices of many persons\r\ndistinguished for their talents and merit, not only in our own time, but\r\nat different periods in the annals of science. He has thought it right\r\nto rescue from oblivion—to commemorate in this way, if not to\r\nconsecrate, the names of some men in this country, more especially, who\r\ndeserve to be ranked among the worthies of America. All this the writer\r\nhas done, too, in conformity to the mode prosecuted by some of the most\r\njudicious biographers and memorialists, together with other writers of\r\nthe same class: It is believed to be a manner of treating the\r\ninteresting subjects, on which the pens of such authors have been\r\nemployed, which, while it renders their works more pleasing, greatly\r\nincreases their usefulness.—If, therefore, some of the matter which has\r\nbeen introduced into the present work should, at first sight, appear\r\nirrelative, and even unimportant, the Memorialist nevertheless flatters\r\nhimself, that, on reflection, nothing will be deemed really so, how\r\nremotely soever it may seem, on a transient view of the subject, to be\r\nconnected with the principal design of the undertaking; provided it has\r\na tendency to illustrate the great objects he was desirous of\r\naccomplishing.[I1]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote I1:\r\n\r\n  The biographer of RITTENHOUSE entirely coincides with the compilers of\r\n  the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, in opinion, respecting the utility and\r\n  propriety of giving an account, in such Memoirs as the present, of\r\n  _things_ as well as _persons_, connected in various ways with the main\r\n  object of the work.\r\n\r\n  In the preface to that useful dictionary of arts, sciences and\r\n  miscellaneous literature, are the following observations: the\r\n  consideration they merit; is submitted to the good sense of the\r\n  reader.\r\n\r\n  “While one part of our readers,” say the encyclopedists, when\r\n  referring to the _biographical_ department of their work, “will regret\r\n  that we have given no account of their favourite philosopher, hero, or\r\n  statesman, others may be disposed to remark, that we have dragged from\r\n  obscurity the names of many persons who were no proper objects of such\r\n  public regard. To these we can only reply, that, with the greatest\r\n  biographer of modern times, we have long thought that there has rarely\r\n  passed a life, of which a faithful narrative would not be useful; and\r\n  that in the lives of the most obscure persons, of whom we have given\r\n  any account, we saw something either connected with recent discoveries\r\n  and public affairs, or which we thought capable of affording a lesson\r\n  to great multitudes in similar circumstances.”—“Between eminent\r\n  achievements and the scenes where they were performed, there is a\r\n  natural and necessary connexion. The character of the warrior is\r\n  connected with the fields of his battles; that of the legislator, with\r\n  the countries which he civilized; and that of the traveller and\r\n  navigator, with the regions which they explored. Even when we read of\r\n  the _persons_ by whom, and the occasions on which, any particular\r\n  branch of knowledge has been improved, we naturally wish to know\r\n  something of the _places_ where such improvements were made.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe diversity of the materials which are, by these means, blended with\r\nthe biographical account of Dr. Rittenhouse, in the Memoirs now\r\npresented to the world, made it expedient, in the opinion of the writer,\r\nto have recourse to the free use of notes, for the purposes of\r\nillustration, reference, and explanation. In a work of such a\r\ncomplexion—constituting a book composed of very various materials,\r\ndesigned to elucidate and inform, as well as to please—it became, in\r\nfact, necessary to throw a large portion of that matter into the form of\r\nnotes; in order to avoid, by numerous digressions on subjects arising\r\nout of the primary object of the work, too much disjointing of the text.\r\nThere are persons, no doubt, by whom this course will be disapproved.\r\nThe able and learned author of the _Pursuits of Literature_ has been\r\naccused by _some critics_—while others, who have no pretensions to those\r\nqualifications which entitle a man to exercise the functions of a\r\ncritic, have even affected to laugh at him—for the multiplicity, the\r\nvariety, and the length of the notes, which he has appended to that\r\npoem. But its being a _satirical_ poem, is the circumstance to which may\r\nbe fairly attributed the censorious cavils which his work excited: his\r\nsatire was felt; and it roused the spleen of those who were its objects,\r\nand their partizans. The present work, however, is far from being\r\nintended to _satirise_ any one; its author has no such object in view:\r\nfor, although he has, in some instances, expressed his disapprobation of\r\ncertain principles, theories, and even measures, which he believes to be\r\nnot only repugnant to true science, but destructive of both private and\r\nsocial happiness—he has refrained as far as possible from personal\r\ncensure;—he would much rather be engaged in the functions of an\r\neulogist, than those of a censor. The numerous notes the Memorialist has\r\nemployed—many of them, too, pretty long—will not therefore, he presumes,\r\nbe objected to, on the ground of personality or supposed ill-humour. He\r\nhas introduced them into his Memoirs, because he believed them to be not\r\nonly useful, but peculiarly well adapted to a work of this nature, and\r\nsuited to answer the general scope of its design. The author may then\r\nsay, in the words of the poetical writer just mentioned—as an apology\r\nfor the frequency and copiousness of the notes annexed to these\r\nMemoirs;—“I have made no allusions which I did not mean to explain. But\r\nI had something further in my intention. The notes are not always\r\nexplanatory; they are of a structure rather peculiar to themselves: many\r\nof them are of a nature between an essay and an explanatory comment.\r\nThere is much in a little compass, suited to the exigency of the times.\r\nI expatiated on the casual subject which presented itself; and when\r\nancient or modern writers expressed the thoughts better than I could\r\nmyself, I have given the original languages. No man has a greater\r\ncontempt for the parade of quotation (as such) than I have. My design is\r\nnot to quote words, but to enforce right sentiments in the manner which\r\nI think best adapted to the purpose, after much reflection.”\r\n\r\nThe method of disposing of the notes, in this work, may be thought by\r\nsome to impair the symmetry of the page: but so trivial a defect as this\r\nmay be, in the typographical appearance of the book, will, it is\r\nsupposed, be amply compensated by the convenience the reader will\r\nexperience, in having the annotations, almost always, on the same pages\r\nwith their respective references.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of the Memoirs, the author has placed the incidents\r\nand circumstances relating to the Life of Dr. Rittenhouse, in their\r\nchronological order, as nearly as could be conveniently done.\r\n\r\nAn APPENDIX,—containing sundry letters and other papers, which could\r\nneither be incorporated with propriety into the text, nor inserted in\r\nmarginal notes,—is placed after the conclusion of the Memoirs. In this\r\npart of the work the reader will find, among other interesting\r\ndocuments, Dr. Rittenhouse’s _Oration_ on the subject of Astronomy,\r\npronounced before the American Philosophical Society, in the year 1775.\r\nThe addition of this treatise to the Life of our Philosopher, was\r\nrendered the more proper,—independently of the intrinsic merit of the\r\nperformance,—by reason of the pamphlet having had, originally, a very\r\nlimited circulation, and its being now out of print. The Notes, added to\r\nthis little tract, as well as to some other papers in the Appendix, by\r\nthe Memorialist, are designated by the initials of his name; in order to\r\ndistinguish the annotations from either the notes originally attached to\r\nthem,—or from other matter, in the Text, not written by himself.\r\n\r\nThe author has embellished his work with an elegantly engraved likeness\r\nof Dr. Rittenhouse, executed by an able artist, from a portrait painted\r\nby Mr. C. W. Peale, in-the year 1772,[I2] when our Philosopher was forty\r\nyears of age. At that time he wore a wig,—and was so represented in the\r\npicture: but afterwards, when he resumed the wearing of his own hair,\r\n(and which he continued to do during the remainder of his life,) the\r\nportrait was altered accordingly, by Mr. Peale. The original picture\r\n(now in the possession of Mrs. Sergeant,) bore a strong resemblance to\r\nDr. Rittenhouse, at that period of his life in which it was taken; and\r\nthe engraving, prefixed to these Memoirs, is an excellent copy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote I2:\r\n\r\n  Mr. C. W. Peale painted at the same time another portrait of him, for\r\n  himself; which is likewise altered from the original painting. It has\r\n  a place in Mr. Peale’s Gallery of Portraits. There is a third, by the\r\n  same hand, in the possession of the American Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\n  Another good picture of Dr. Rittenhouse was also then made, by Mr.\r\n  James Peale, for the Rev. Mr. Barton. This (which represents him with\r\n  a wig) is now in the possession of John Moore White, Esq. of\r\n  New-Jersey, who married Mr. Barton’s youngest daughter.\r\n\r\n  A pretty good mezzotinto, in a large size,—done from Mr. C. W. Peale’s\r\n  painting of our Philosopher,—was executed by Mr. E. Savage, in the\r\n  winter of 1796: and since that time, some small engravings have been\r\n  made from different pictures of him; but these do not so well preserve\r\n  the likeness.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo a portion of the readers of this work, some of the matter it contains\r\nmay be thought superfluous,—because already familiar to _them_: and, to\r\nmen of extensive learning and research, much of the information herein\r\ncollected may really be so. But to persons of less erudition and\r\nscience, the knowledge thus communicated it may be presumed, will prove\r\nin some degree useful; and the writer indulges a confident belief, that\r\nthe greater number of his readers will derive both instruction and\r\ngratification, from a perusal of the Memoirs now offered to their\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe favours which the Memorialist has received, in the communication of\r\nsundry papers and some information for this work, demand his thankful\r\nacknowledgments to the contributors. Among these,—besides those\r\ngentlemen occasionally mentioned in the Memoirs,—the writer returns his\r\nthanks to his worthy relatives, Mrs. Sergeant, Mrs. Waters, and Dr.\r\nBenjamin Smith Barton; and also to the Rt. Rev. Bishop White, Andrew\r\nEllicott, Esq. John Vaughan, Esq. the Rev. Dr. Samuel Stanhope Smith,\r\nCharles Smith, Esq. and the Rev. Mr. Cathcart. To the friendship and\r\npoliteness of these very respectable characters, he holds himself\r\nindebted, on this occasion.[I3]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote I3:\r\n\r\n  Some interesting information was likewise communicated by the late\r\n  Professor Rush. The death of that gentleman having occurred since the\r\n  completion of the present work, the author has inserted a concise\r\n  biographical notice of him, in the Appendix, in place of the mention\r\n  originally made of his name in this preface.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been the earnest desire of the writer, to adhere strictly to\r\nTruth, in every part of his narrative: he has not, therefore, introduced\r\ninto his work any thing, as a matter of Fact, which he did not believe\r\nto be well founded. Wherever he has ventured to express an Opinion of\r\nhis own, on any subject of importance, it must be left to the judgment\r\nand candour of others to determine, what weight it may be entitled\r\nto.—In the various quotations which appear in his Memoirs, the writer\r\nhas endeavoured to observe the utmost fidelity, with respect to the\r\noriginals; and all his translations into the English, from other\r\nlanguages, have been made with a like scrupulous attention to\r\ncorrectness.—Some errors and inaccuracies have nevertheless, it may be\r\nreadily supposed, found their way into the following work; though the\r\nwriter trusts they are neither numerous nor very important: and, as they\r\nare wholly unintentional, of whatever description they may be, he hopes\r\nit will not be deemed presumptuous in him, to claim for them the\r\nindulgence of a candid, liberal, and discerning public.\r\n\r\n LANCASTER, in Pennsylvania,\r\n          April 11, 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe individuals in society, who present to the view of their\r\ncotemporaries, and transmit to posterity, Memorials of illustrious\r\nmen,—more especially those of their own country,—discharge thereby a\r\ndebt of gratitude: because every man is, directly or indirectly,\r\ninterested in the benefits conferred on his species, by those who\r\nenlarge the sphere of human knowledge, or otherwise promote the\r\nhappiness of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut the biographer of an highly meritorious character aims at more than\r\nthe mere performance of that duty, which a grateful sense of obligation\r\nexacts from him, in common with every member of the community, in\r\ncommemorating the beneficence of the wise and the good: he endeavours to\r\nexcite in great and liberal minds, by the example of such, an ambition\r\nto emulate their talents and their virtues;—and it is these, that, by\r\ntheir union, constitute true greatness of character.\r\n\r\nThe meed of applause which may be sometimes, and too often is, bestowed\r\non meretricious worth, is ever unsteady and fleeting. The pseudo-patriot\r\nmay happen to enjoy a transient popularity; false philosophy may, for a\r\nwhile, delude, if not corrupt, the minds of an unthinking multitude; and\r\nspecious theories in every department of science,—unsupported by\r\nexperience and untenable on principles of sound reason,—may give to\r\ntheir projectors a short-lived reputation: But the celebrity which is\r\ncoveted by the man of a noble and generous spirit,—that estimable\r\nspecies of fame, which alone can survive such ephemera of error as are\r\noften engendered by the vanity of the individual and nurtured by the\r\nfollies or vices of the many,—must ever rest on the permanent foundation\r\nof truth, knowledge and beneficence.\r\n\r\nVirtue is essentially necessary to the constitution of a truly great\r\ncharacter. For, although brilliant talents are sometimes found combined\r\nwith vicious propensities,[1]—the impulse given to men of this\r\ndescription, often renders their great abilities baneful to society:\r\nthey can seldom, if ever, be productive of real public good. Should\r\neminent talents, possessed by a man destitute of virtue, even take a\r\nright direction in their operation, by reason of some extraordinary\r\ncircumstance,—such an event ought never to be calculated on: It is not\r\nthe part of common sense,—much less of a cautious prudence, acquired by\r\na knowledge of mankind,—to expect praise-worthy conduct from any one,\r\nwhose predominating passions are bad, however great may be his\r\ncapability of doing good.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Hence, in conformity to this sentiment, Mr. Pope says, when\r\n  animadverting on the insufficiency of talents, alone, for acquiring an\r\n  honourable fame and meriting a character truly great,—\r\n\r\n              “If parts allure thee, think how Bacon shin’d,\r\n              The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind;\r\n              Or, ravish’d with the whistling of a name,\r\n              See Cromwell damn’d to everlasting fame.”\r\n                                        [ESSAY ON MAN.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the mind may view, with a sort of admiration, the\r\nachievements of a magnanimous soldier, it turns with indignation from\r\nthe atrocities of a military tyrant: and at the same time that it may be\r\ninduced to contemplate even with complacency, at the first view, the\r\nplausible, yet groundless speculations of ingenious theorists, in\r\nmatters of science,—still the fallacy of their systems, when developed\r\nby experience, strips them of all their tinseled glare of merit. Thus,\r\ntoo, the applause which the world justly attaches to the character of a\r\npatriot-hero, deserts the unprincipled ruffian-warrior, however valiant\r\nand successful he may prove: In like manner, reason and experience\r\nexpose to the censure of the good and the derision of the wise, the\r\ndeleterious doctrines of metaphysical statesmen and philosophers.[2]\r\nSuch estimable qualities as they may possess, in either character, are\r\nmerged in the mischievous or base ones, with which they are combined:\r\nthus, infamy or contempt eventually become the merited portion of crime\r\nor of folly, as either one or the other may prevail. A Cæsar,[3] a\r\nCromwell and a Robespierre, with other scourges of mankind, of like\r\ncharacter, will therefore be viewed as objects of execration by\r\nposterity, while the memories of an Alfred, a Nassau, and a Washington—a\r\nChatham, a Burke, and an Ames,—will be venerated, to the latest\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The miserable consequences which have resulted to the civilized world,\r\n  from the mode of reasoning _abstractly_, and from the mere\r\n  _synthetical_ plan of philosophising, are too apparent to need much\r\n  comment. Even some _geometricians_ of great name have been seduced, by\r\n  such means, into monstrous absurdities in physics; and into the\r\n  maintenance of doctrines, alike subversive of religion and morals, as\r\n  destructive of the foundations of civil society. Such were Descartes,\r\n  Leibnitz and Spinoza, of the seventeenth century: and such have been,\r\n  and even now are, too many of that class of modern philosophers, as\r\n  well in this country as on the continent of Europe,—whose metaphysical\r\n  notions of religion and government, (although some of them may,\r\n  perhaps, be pretty correct on the subject of physics, alone,) have\r\n  been the means of inundating the world with scepticism; and, after\r\n  overturning regular, orderly, and peaceable states, of establishing\r\n  despotism and misery on the ruins of rational government, in many of\r\n  the fairest portions of the old world.\r\n\r\n  Even Voltaire, who had, himself, been instrumental in corrupting the\r\n  mind of the great Frederick of Prussia, and, thus, of furnishing the\r\n  means for the subsequent overthrow of that once powerful monarchy;\r\n  even _this infidel_ could not help exclaiming, in a moment of sober\r\n  reflection, “Who could have believed, that _geometricians_ have been\r\n  wild enough to imagine, that, in the exaltation of the soul, we may\r\n  possess the gift of divination; yet more than one philosopher took it\r\n  into their heads, by the example of _Descartes_, to put themselves\r\n  into God’s place, and create a world with a word! But now, all _these\r\n  philosophical follies_ are reproved by the wise; and even their\r\n  fantastical edifices, overthrown by reason, have left in their ruins,\r\n  materials, of which reason has made some use.—A like extravagance has\r\n  infected the _moral_ world: there have been some understandings so\r\n  blind as to undermine the very foundation of society, at the time they\r\n  thought to reform it. They have been mad enough to maintain that the\r\n  distinctions of _meum & tuum_ are criminal, and that one ought not to\r\n  enjoy the fruits of one’s own labour; that not only all mankind are\r\n  upon a level, but that they have perverted the order of nature, in\r\n  forming societies; that men are born to be separated from each other,\r\n  like wild beasts; and that amphibious animals, with bees and ants,\r\n  confound the eternal laws, by living in common! These impertinences,\r\n  worthy of an hospital of madmen,” continues Mr. de Voltaire,\r\n  sarcastically, “have been for some time in fashion, just as it is\r\n  customary to lead apes to dance, at fairs.” [See THE AGE OF LOUIS XV.\r\n  ch. 39.]\r\n\r\n  But although it cannot be doubted; that the society of Voltaire\r\n  contributed to support, if not to generate, the deistical principles\r\n  of Frederick II. other foreigners, whom he had patronized and\r\n  cherished in his own capital, and with whom he associated, most of\r\n  them Frenchmen, did much towards debauching his mind, in regard to\r\n  religion. The Prince de Ligne, a distinguished Austrian field-marshal,\r\n  has verified this remark. In a letter written to the king of Poland,\r\n  in the year 1785, the prince narrates some particulars of a\r\n  conversation which took place between the Prussian monarch and\r\n  himself, in the year 1770; and observes, that the king expressed his\r\n  libertine sentiments too freely, even making a boast of his\r\n  irreligion. The prince de Ligne, on this occasion, charges\r\n  freethinkers with a want of candour, in promulgating opinions fraught\r\n  with infidelity, while many of them heartily dread the consequences of\r\n  what they affect to renounce. But this, he remarks, is not their only\r\n  fault: “they are also apt,” says he, “to make a parade of\r\n  free-thinking; which betrays, at least, a want of taste. It was,”\r\n  continues the prince, “from having been surrounded by men of bad\r\n  taste, such as D’Argens, Maupertuis, La Beaumelle, La Mettrie, the\r\n  Abbé de Brades, and some clumsy infidels of his academy, that the king\r\n  had contracted the habit of abusing religion, and talking of dogmas,\r\n  Spinozism, the court of Rome, &c.”\r\n\r\n                      LETTERS AND REFLEXIONS OF THE PRINCE DE LIGNE.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  However Cæsar may be admired as an accomplished gentleman and\r\n  scholar,—or even as a great and gallant soldier,—he ought ever to be\r\n  reprobated as an usurper and a tyrant.—Dr. Adam Ferguson remarks, that\r\n  “Julius Cæsar possessed the talent of influencing, of gaining, and\r\n  employing men to his purpose, beyond any other person that is known in\r\n  the history of the world: but it is surely not for the good of\r\n  mankind,” continues this able writer, “that he should be admired in\r\n  other respects. To admire even his clemency, is to mistake for it\r\n  policy and cunning.” [See Ferguson’s _Hist. of the Progress and\r\n  Termination of the Roman Republic_, vol. 5. ch. 36.]\r\n\r\n  Indeed our admiration of the great _military_ talents of such a man as\r\n  Cæsar, may carry us too far. Mr. Hume, in his History of England (ch.\r\n  47.) very justly observes—that “The unhappy prepossession which men\r\n  commonly entertain in favour of ambition, courage, enterprise, and\r\n  other warlike virtues, engages generous natures,—who always love\r\n  fame,—into such pursuits as destroy their own peace, and that of the\r\n  rest of mankind.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMuch of the glory of a nation results from the renown of illustrious\r\nmen, among its citizens: a country which has produced many great men,\r\nmay justly pride itself on the fame which those individuals had\r\nacquired. The community to which we belong is entitled to such services\r\nas we can render to it: these the patriot will cheerfully bestow; and,\r\nin promoting the honour and prosperity of his country, a large portion\r\nof the lustre which the exertion of his talents shall have shed upon it,\r\nare again reflected on himself.[4]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Fontenelle in his _Eloge_ on Sir Isaac Newton (published by the\r\n  Royal Academy of Sciences, at Paris,) mentions particularly the great\r\n  honours that were paid him, by his countrymen, as well during his life\r\n  as after his decease. “The English,” says he, “are not apt to pay the\r\n  less regard to great abilities, for being of their native growth; but\r\n  instead of endeavouring to lessen them by injurious reflexions, or\r\n  approving the envy which attacks them, they all join together in\r\n  striving to advocate them,”—“They are sensible that a great genius\r\n  must reflect honour upon the state; and whoever is able to procure it\r\n  to their country, is upon that account infinitely dear to\r\n  them.”—“Tacitus,” says he, “who has reproached the Romans with their\r\n  extreme indifference towards the great men of their own nation, would\r\n  have given the English quite a different character.”—And, after\r\n  describing the almost princely magnificence, in the manner of Newton’s\r\n  interment in Westminster Abbey, Mr. Fontenelle remarks, that we must\r\n  almost go back to the ancient Greeks, if we would find a like instance\r\n  of so great a veneration paid to learning.\r\n\r\n  The following epitaph, in classical Latin, is inscribed on the noble\r\n  monument erected to the memory of Newton, in the Abbey Church of\r\n  Westminster:\r\n\r\n                                 H.

Truth is\r\nevery where the same; and the promulgation of it tends, at all times and\r\nin all places, to elevate to its proper station the dignity of man. The\r\nmore extensively, then, true science can be diffused, the greater will\r\nbe the means—the fairer will be the rational prospect, of enlarging the\r\nsphere of human happiness. The philosopher may, pre-eminently, be\r\nconsidered as a citizen of the world; yet without detracting in any\r\ndegree from that spirit of patriotism, which ever stimulates a good man\r\nto contribute his primary and most important services to his own\r\ncountry. There are, indeed, some species of aids, which are exclusively\r\ndue to a community, by all its citizens; and, consequently, such as they\r\nare bound to withhold from other national communities, in certain\r\ncontingencies and under peculiar circumstances. But a knowledge of those\r\ntruths which lead to the acquisition of wisdom and practice of virtue,\r\nserves to meliorate the condition of mankind generally, at all times,\r\nand under all circumstances;—inasmuch as they greatly assist in\r\nbanishing error, with its frequent concomitant, vice, not only from the\r\nmore civilized portions of the world, but also by their inherent\r\ninfluence, from among nations less cultivated and refined.\r\n\r\nThe truths promulgated by means of a natural and sublime\r\nphilosophy—corresponding, as this does, with the dignity of an\r\nenlightened spirit—must ever emanate from a virtuous heart as well as an\r\nexpanded intellect. Hence, the real philosopher,—he whose principles are\r\nunpolluted by the sophisticated tenets of some modern pretenders to the\r\nappellation,—can scarcely fail to be a _good man_. Such was the immortal\r\nNewton; such were a Boyle, a Hale and a Barrow,—a Boerhaave, a Stephen\r\nHales and a Bradley; with many worthies equally illustrious,—whose\r\nglories will, for ever, retain their primitive splendour.\r\n\r\nEven the most celebrated sages of antiquity, extremely imperfect as we\r\nknow the philosophy of the early ages to have been, elucidated, by the\r\npurity of their lives and the morality of their doctrines, the truth of\r\nthe position,—that the cultivation of natural wisdom, unaided as it then\r\nwas by the lights of revelation, encreased every propensity to moral\r\nvirtue. Such were Socrates, Plato his disciple, and Anaxagoras; who\r\nflourished between four and five centuries before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe life of Socrates, who is styled by Cicero _the Father of\r\nPhilosophers_, afforded a laudable example of moderation, patience, and\r\nother virtues; and his doctrines abound with wisdom. Anaxagoras and\r\nPlato united with some of the nobler branches of natural science, very\r\nrational conceptions of moral truth. Both of them had much higher claims\r\nto the title of philosophers, than Aristotle, who appeared about a\r\ncentury afterwards. This philosopher, however,—for, as such, he\r\ncontinued for many ages to be distinguished in the schools,—was, like\r\nSocrates, more a metaphysician than an observer of the natural world.\r\nHis morality is the most estimable part of his works; though his\r\nconceptions of moral truths were much less just than those of Anaxagoras\r\nand Plato:[5] for his physics are replete with notions and terms alike\r\nvague, unmeaning and obscure.[6] The intimate connexion that subsists\r\nbetween the physical and moral fitness of things, in relation to their\r\nrespective objects, was more evidently known to Anaxagoras and Plato,\r\nthan to either Socrates or Aristotle: and the reason is obvious;—both of\r\nthe former cultivated the sublime science of _Astronomy_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Aristotle is supposed, by some, to have imbibed the best and most\r\n  rational of his notions from his master Plato; to whom,\r\n  notwithstanding, he seems to have been greatly inferior as a moral\r\n  philosopher.\r\n\r\n  His opinions respecting government, abound in good sense. As a\r\n  general outline of his sentiments on this subject, it may serve to\r\n  mention, that he distinguished civil government into two kinds; one,\r\n  in which the general welfare is the great object; the other, in\r\n  which this is not at all considered.[5a] In the first class, he\r\n  places the limited monarchy—the aristocratical form of\r\n  government—and the republic, properly so called. In the second, he\r\n  comprehends tyranny—oligarchy—and democracy; considering these as\r\n  corruptions of the three first. Limited monarchy, he alleges,\r\n  degenerates into despotism, when the sovereign assumes to himself\r\n  the exercise of the entire authority of the state, refusing to\r\n  submit his power to any controul;[5b] the aristocracy sinks into an\r\n  oligarchy, when the supreme power is no longer possessed by a\r\n  reasonable proportion of virtuous men,—but by a small number of\r\n  rulers, whose wealth alone constitutes their claim to authority; and\r\n  the republican government is debased into a democracy, when the\r\n  poorest class of the people have too great an influence in the\r\n  public deliberations.[5c]\r\n\r\n  In Physics, Aristotle scarcely deserves the name of a Philosopher.—As\r\n  to his metaphysical opinions, in the common acceptation of the\r\n  term,—it is impossible to ascertain, with certainty, what they really\r\n  were. It was not until eighteen centuries after his death, that his\r\n  philosophy—such as it was then promulgated, anew—began to be generally\r\n  known and studied. After the sacking of Constantinople by the Turks,\r\n  in the year 1453, some fugitive Greeks, who had escaped the fury of\r\n  the Ottoman arms, brought from that city into the west of Europe many\r\n  of the writings of the Stagyritish philosopher: But, although some of\r\n  his treatises were previously known, they were such as had passed\r\n  through the hands of the Arabs, in translations into their tongue;\r\n  done by men who, it may be fairly presumed, very imperfectly\r\n  understood the author’s language; consequently not capable, even if\r\n  they were disposed, to do justice to the sense of the original.\r\n  Subsequent translations of those writings, from the Arabic, probably\r\n  occasioned, in the same way, further departures from the meaning of\r\n  the original Greek. Thus varying, as may be supposed, from the\r\n  opinions taught by Aristotle himself,—the philosophy of the schoolmen,\r\n  engrafted upon his systems, was neither entirely that of the\r\n  Stagyrite, nor altogether different. His writings, nevertheless, gave\r\n  birth to what is termed the Scholastic Philosophy,—“that motley\r\n  offspring of error and ingenuity,” as it is called by Mr. Mallet.[5d]\r\n  “To trace at length,” says this writer, “the rise, progress, and\r\n  variations of _this philosophy_, would be an undertaking not only\r\n  curious, but instructive; as it would unfold to us all the mazes in\r\n  which the force, the subtlety, the extravagance of human wit, can lose\r\n  themselves: till not only profane learning, but Divinity itself, was\r\n  at last, by the refined frenzy of those who taught both, subtilized\r\n  into mere notion and air.”[5e]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5a:\r\n\r\n  Aristot. de Rep.—lib, 3. cap. 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5b:\r\n\r\n  Id. Rhet.—lib. 1. cap. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5c:\r\n\r\n  Id. de Rep.—lib. 3. cap. 7.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5d:\r\n\r\n  In his _Life of Lord Chancellor Bacon_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5e:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Baron Bielfeld (in his _Elements of Universal Erudition_) observes,\r\n  that the fondness for Aristotle’s reveries began about the twelfth\r\n  century. It was then, that the _scholastic_ philosophy was formed.\r\n  This was partly borrowed from the writings of the Arabs, who were\r\n  always attached to the theories of Aristotle: they were initiated into\r\n  a subtile, ambiguous, abstract and capricious mode of reasoning; by\r\n  which they never hit the truth, but constantly went on the one side,\r\n  or beyond the truth. Toward the end of the fourteenth century,\r\n  continues the learned Baron, this absurd system arrived to a great\r\n  height. It became a mere jargon, a confused heap of unintelligible\r\n  ideas.\r\n\r\n  The celebrated Mr. Boyle, the great successor of Lord Verulam (St.\r\n  Albans) in experimental philosophy, is said to have declared against\r\n  the Philosophy of Aristotle, as having in it more of words than\r\n  things; promising much and performing little; and giving the\r\n  Inventions of Men for indubitable proofs, instead of building upon\r\n  observation and experiment. He was so zealous for, and so scrupulous\r\n  about, this true method of learning by experiment, that, though the\r\n  _Cartesian_ philosophy then made a great noise in the world, yet he\r\n  would never be persuaded to read the works of _Descartes_; for fear he\r\n  should be amused, and led away, by plausible accounts of things\r\n  founded on conjecture, and merely hypothetical. (See Art. _Boyle_, in\r\n  the New and General Biography.)—This great and excellent man was born\r\n  the same year in which Bacon, Viscount St. Albans, died.\r\n\r\n  Epicurus, the disciple of Democritus, and follower of the Philosophy\r\n  of Aristotle, was engaged, although unsuccessfully enough, in the\r\n  labyrinth of Metaphysics, as well as in Physics. He adopted the system\r\n  of _Atoms_, which Democritus first propagated; and hence appears to be\r\n  derived Descartes’s equally preposterous doctrine of the _Plenum_ and\r\n  of _Vortices_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo this cause, then, may be fairly attributed the half-enlightened\r\nnotions of the Deity,[7] and of a future state, entertained by these\r\npagan searchers after truth. To the same cause may be traced the\r\nsentiment that dictated the reply made by Anaxagoras,—when, in\r\nconsequence of his incessant contemplation of the stars, he was asked,\r\n“_if he had no concern for his country?_”—“_I incessantly regard my\r\ncountry_,” said he, pointing to Heaven.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  “Nulla gens tam fera, quæ non sciat Deum habendum esse, quamvis\r\n  ignoret qualem habere deceat.”\r\n\r\n                                                  CIC. de Naturâ Deorum.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPlato’s attention to the same celestial science unquestionably enlarged\r\nhis notions of the Deity, and enabled him to think the more justly of\r\nthe moral attributes of human nature. According to Plato—whose morality,\r\non the whole, corresponds with the system maintained by Socrates,[8]—the\r\nhuman soul is a ray from the Divinity. He believed, that this minute\r\nportion of infinite Wisdom, Goodness and Power, was omniscient, while\r\nunited with the Parent stock from which it emanated; but, when combined\r\nwith the body, that it contracted ignorance and impurity from that\r\nunion. He did not, like his master Socrates, neglect natural philosophy;\r\nbut investigated many principles which relate to that branch of\r\nknowledge:—and, according to this philosopher, all things consisted of\r\ntwo principles,—_God_ and _matter_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  While Plato followed the morals of Socrates, he cultivated the\r\n  metaphysical opinions of Pythagoras. He is said to have founded his\r\n  physics on the notions of Heraclitus: it may be presumed,\r\n  nevertheless, that he derived that branch of his system from a better\r\n  source.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Plato believed in the immortality of the soul of man;\r\nbut he had, at the same time, very inadequate conceptions of the mode or\r\nstate of its existence, when separated from the body. It seems to have\r\nbeen reserved for the Christian dispensation, to elucidate this great\r\n_arcanum_, hidden from the most sagacious of the heathen\r\nphilosophers.[9] It was the difficulty that arose on this subject, the\r\nincapability of knowing how to dispose of the soul, or intellectual\r\nprinciple in the constitution of our species, after its disentanglement\r\nfrom the body; a difficulty by which all the philosophers, antecedent to\r\nthe promulgation of Christianity, were subjected to unsurmountable\r\nperplexities;—it was this, that rendered even the expansive genius of\r\nAnaxagoras utterly incompetent to conceive of the possibility that the\r\nsoul should exist, independent of some union with matter. He therefore\r\ninvented the doctrine of the _Metempsychosis_; in order to provide some\r\nreceptacle of organised matter for that imperishable intellectual\r\nprinciple attached to our nature here, after its departure from the\r\nhuman frame; and to which new vehicle of the vital spirit of its\r\noriginal but abandoned abode, the extinguished corporeal man, its union\r\nwith it should impart the powers and faculties of animal life.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n       “_Reason_, tho’ taught by sense to range on high,\r\n       To trace the stars and measure all the sky;\r\n       Tho’ fancy, memory, foresight fill her train,\r\n       And o’er the beast he lifts the pride of man;\r\n       Yet, still to _matter_, _form_ and _space_ confin’d,\r\n       Or moral truths or laws that rule mankind,\r\n       Could ne’er, _unaided_, pierce the mental gloom,\r\n       Explore _new_ scenes _beyond the closing tomb_,\r\n       Reach with _immortal_ hope the blest abode,\r\n       Or raise one thought of _spirit_ or of GOD.”\r\n                                   _Vision of Columbus_, book VIII.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCultivating, as Plato did, the mind-expanding science of Astronomy,\r\nfaintly even as the true principles of this branch of science were then\r\nperceived,[10] this philosopher could not fail to derive, from the\r\nvastness, beauty and order, manifested in the appearances and\r\nrevolutions of the heavenly bodies, a conviction of the perpetual\r\nexistence of a great intelligent First Cause. It was, indeed, as the\r\nAbbé Barthelemy justly remarks, the order and beauty apparent through\r\nthe whole universe, that compelled men to resort to a First Cause:[11]\r\nThis, he observes, the early philosophers of the Ionian school (which\r\nowed its origin to Thales) had acknowledged. But Anaxagoras[12] was the\r\nfirst who discriminated that First Cause from matter; and not only this\r\ndistinguished pupil of Thales,[13] but Anaximander, who, antecedently to\r\nhim, taught philosophy at Athens, with Archelaus the master of Socrates,\r\nall treated in their writings of the formation of the universe, of the\r\nnature of things, and of geometry and astronomy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  “An inordinate desire to explain and generalise, without facts and\r\n  observations, led the ancient philosophers to the most absurd and\r\n  extravagant notions; though, in a few cases, they have displayed the\r\n  most wonderful ingenuity, and sagaciously anticipated the discoveries\r\n  of modern times.”\r\n\r\n                                  _New Edinb. Encyclop._ tit. Astronomy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  “If the petty motions of us mortals afford arguments for the being of\r\n  a God, much more may those greater motions we see in the world, and\r\n  the phænomena attending them: I mean, the motions of the planets and\r\n  heavenly bodies. For these must be put into motion either by one\r\n  common mighty Mover, acting upon them immediately, or by causes and\r\n  laws of His appointment; or by their respective movers, who, for\r\n  reasons to which you can by this time be no stranger,” (referring his\r\n  reader to preceding arguments), “must depend upon some Superior, that\r\n  furnished them with the power of doing this. And granting it to be\r\n  done either of these ways, we can be at no great distance from a\r\n  demonstration of the existence of a Deity.”—Wollaston’s _Rel. of Nat.\r\n  delineated_, sect. v. head 14th.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  A disciple of Anaximenes, and preceptor to Socrates. He died 428 years\r\n  B.

Being the\r\n  first of the Greeks who made any discoveries in _Astronomy_, he is\r\n  said to have astonished his countrymen, by predicting a solar eclipse;\r\n  and he instructed them, by communicating the knowledge of geometry and\r\n  astronomy, which he had acquired while in Egypt. He died in the\r\n  ninety-sixth year of his age,—544 years B. C.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Gibbon, the philosophers of Greece deduced their morals\r\nfrom the nature of man, rather than from that of God. They meditated,\r\nhowever, as we are informed by this very ingenious historian, on the\r\nDivine Nature, as a most curious and important speculation; and, in the\r\nprofound enquiry, they displayed both the strength and the weakness of\r\nthe human understanding. The Stoics and the Platonists endeavoured to\r\nreconcile the interests of reason with their notions of piety. The\r\nopinions of the Academicians and Epicureans, the two other of the four\r\nmost celebrated schools, were of a less religious cast: But, continues\r\nMr. Gibbon, whilst the modest science of the former induced them to\r\ndoubt, the positive ignorance of the latter urged them to deny, the\r\nprovidence of a Supreme Ruler.\r\n\r\nCicero[14] denominated the God of Plato the _Maker_, and the God of\r\nAristotle the _Governor_, of the world.[15] It is somewhere observed,\r\nthat it is no reflection on the character of Plato, to have been unable,\r\nby the efforts of his own reason, to acquire any notion of a proper\r\ncreation; since we, who have the advantage of his writings, nay of\r\nwritings infinitely more valuable than his, to instruct us, find it\r\nextremely difficult, if not impossible, to conceive how any thing can\r\nfirst begin to have an existence. We believe the fact, on the authority\r\nof Revelation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Marcus Tullius Cicero—the same that has been already mentioned. He\r\n  was, himself, not only one of the most learned and eloquent men, but\r\n  one of the greatest philosophers, of antiquity. This illustrious Roman\r\n  (whose death occurred forty-three years before the Christian era)\r\n  firmly believed in the being of a God. He was likewise a decided\r\n  advocate for the doctrine of the soul’s immortality; concerning which,\r\n  some fine reasoning will be found in his book on _Old Age_;—a\r\n  doctrine, however, by no means confined to Cicero alone, but one\r\n  maintained by many of the most eminent among the heathen philosophers,\r\n  in the early ages. Plato appears to have been the first who supported\r\n  that opinion upon sound and permanent arguments, deduced from truth\r\n  and established principles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Cicero himself says, “If any one doubt, whether there be _a God_, I\r\n  cannot comprehend why the same person may not as well doubt, whether\r\n  there be a sun or not.” [_De Naturâ Deorum_, 2. 2.]\r\n\r\n  It is observed by Dr. Turnbull, in his annotations on Heineccius’s\r\n  _System of Universal Law_, that Polybius as well as Cicero, and indeed\r\n  almost all the ancient philosophers, have acknowledged, that a public\r\n  sense of Religion is necessary to the well-being and support of civil\r\n  society: and such a sentiment of Religion is inseparable from a\r\n  reasonable conception of the being and attributes of the Deity.\r\n  “Society,” says Dr. Turnbull very truly, “can hardly subsist without\r\n  it: or, at least, it is the most powerful mean for restraining from\r\n  vice; and for promoting and upholding those virtues by which society\r\n  subsists, and without which every thing that is great and comely in\r\n  society must soon perish and go to ruin.”—“With regard to private\r\n  persons,” continues this learned writer, “he who does not often employ\r\n  his mind in reviewing the perfections of the Deity, and in consoling\r\n  and strengthening his mind by the comfortable and mind-exalting\r\n  reflexions, to which meditation upon the universal providence of an\r\n  all-perfect mind, naturally, and as it were, necessarily lead,\r\n  deprives himself of the greatest joy, the noblest exercise and\r\n  entertainment, the human mind is capable of; and whatever obligations\r\n  there may to virtue, he cannot be so firm, steady, and unshaken in his\r\n  adherence to it, as he, who, being persuaded of the truth just\r\n  mentioned, is daily drawing virtuous strength and comfort from it.”\r\n  [See the Annotator’s remark on ch. v. b. i. of _Heineccius_.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nGreat were, undoubtedly, the improvements in astronomy, made by the\r\nGreek philosophers of early ages, on such of its rudiments as were\r\nhanded down to them from those nations by whom it was first\r\ncultivated:[16] Yet it can scarcely be conceived, that, until the\r\ncelebrated Euclid of Alexandria,[17] and his followers, had reduced the\r\nmathematics of Thales and others of those philosophers, into regular\r\nsystems of arithmetical and geometrical science, the true principles of\r\nastronomy could be ascertained. In fact, seventeen centuries and an half\r\nhad elapsed, from the time of that great geometrician, before Copernicus\r\nappeared: when this wonderful genius, availing himself of such remnants\r\nof the ancient philosophy, as the intervening irruptions of the\r\nbarbarous nations of the north upon the then civilized world had left to\r\ntheir posterity, opened to the view of mankind the real system of the\r\nuniverse.[18]—So vast was the chasm, during which the nobler branches of\r\nphysics remained uncultivated and neglected, that, from the age of\r\nEuclid, fourteen centuries passed away, before Roger Bacon, an English\r\nFranciscan friar, began his successful enquiries into experimental\r\nphilosophy.—This extraordinary man is said to have been almost the only\r\n_astronomer_ of his age; and he himself tells us, that there were not,\r\nthen, more than three or four persons in the world who had made any\r\nconsiderable proficiency in the _mathematics_!\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  The Greeks derived their knowledge of astronomy from the Egyptians and\r\n  Chaldeans. According to Plutarch, the sciences began to unfold\r\n  themselves about the time of Hesiod, the Greek poet, who flourished\r\n  upwards of nine centuries before the Christian era; but their progress\r\n  was very slow, until the time of Thales, which was about three\r\n  centuries later. And although this celebrated philosopher of antiquity\r\n  rendered himself famous by foretelling an eclipse of the sun, he only\r\n  predicted the _year_ in which it was to happen. Even this, it is\r\n  remarked by Mr. Vince (in his invaluable work, entitled, _A Complete\r\n  System of Astronomy_,) he was probably enabled to do by the _Chaldean\r\n  Saros_, a period of 223 lunations; after which, the eclipses return\r\n  again nearly in the same order. Philolaus, a disciple of Pythagoras,\r\n  lived about four hundred and fifty years before Christ, and is said to\r\n  have taught the true solar system,—placing the sun in the centre, with\r\n  the earth and all the planets revolving about it; a system which, it\r\n  is believed, Pythogaras himself had conceived, and was inclined to\r\n  adopt.\r\n\r\n  However, Hipparchus, who lived between one hundred and twenty-five and\r\n  one hundred and sixty years before the Christian era, and whom Mr.\r\n  Vince styles “the Father of Astronomy,” was the first person that\r\n  cultivated every part of that science. His discoveries, together with\r\n  those of Ptolemy, are preserved in the Μεγαλη Σύνταξις, or _Great\r\n  Construction_,—Ptolemy’s celebrated work on Astronomy, named by the\r\n  Arabs the _Almagest_, and now usually so called.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  This great philosopher of antiquity, so justly entitled to celebrity\r\n  for his mathematical works, flourished three hundred years before the\r\n  Christian era. Care should be taken not to confound him with Euclid of\r\n  Megara, who lived a century earlier. The latter, as the Abbé\r\n  Barthelemi observes, being too much familiarized with the writings of\r\n  Parmenides and the Elean school, had recourse to abstractions; “a\r\n  method,” says the Abbé, “often dangerous, oftener unintelligible.”\r\n  Just after, he adds: “The subtleties of metaphysics calling to their\r\n  aid the quirks of logic, _words_ presently took place of _things_, and\r\n  students acquired nothing in the schools but a spirit of acrimony and\r\n  contradiction.” _Travels of the younger Anacharsis_, vol. iii. chap.\r\n  37.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  That the sun is at rest, and that the planets revolve round him, is an\r\n  opinion that appears to have been received of old, by Philolaus,\r\n  Aristarchus of Samos, and the whole sect of the Pythagoreans. It is\r\n  probable, as Mr. Rowning[18a] observes, that this notion was derived\r\n  from them, by the Greeks: But the opinion that the sun stood still in\r\n  the centre, while the whole heavens moved around it, was the\r\n  prevailing one, until Copernicus, by the establishment of his system,\r\n  restored the ancient astronomy of the Pythagorean school.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18a:\r\n\r\n  In his _Compendious System of Natural Philosophy_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut after the appearance of Copernicus,[19] succeeded by the ingenious\r\nTycho Brahe[20] and sagacious Kepler,[21] arose the learned physiologist\r\nBacon, Viscount of St. Albans,—one of the most illustrious contributors\r\nto the yet scanty stock of experimental philosophy.[22] And soon after,\r\nin the same age and nation, was manifested to the world, in the full\r\nglory of meridian splendour, that great luminary of natural science, who\r\nfirst enlightened mankind by diffusing among them the rays of\r\nwell-ascertained truths; clearly exhibiting to all, those fundamental\r\nprinciples of the laws of nature, by which the grand, the stupendous\r\nsystem of the material universe is both sustained and governed:—\r\n\r\n              “Nature and Nature’s Laws lay hid in night;\r\n              God said, Let NEWTON be,—and all was Light.”\r\n\r\nFinally, it was reserved for our own age and country to derive dignity\r\nand fame, from having given birth to an illustrious successor and\r\ndisciple of that immortal man, in the person of the yet\r\nrecently-departed RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  Nicholas Copernic (usually latinized, by adding the terminating\r\n  syllable, us,) that celebrated astronomer, “whose vast genius,\r\n  assisted by such lights as the remains of antiquity afforded him,\r\n  explained the true system of the universe, as at present\r\n  understood,”[19a] was born at Thorn in Royal Prussia, the 19th of\r\n  January, 1442. He was alike distinguished for his piety and innocence,\r\n  as for his extraordinary genius and discoveries. He died in the\r\n  seventy-seventh year of his age.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19a:\r\n\r\n  _Ritt. Orat._\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  This great man was a native of Knudsturp, a province of Scania in\r\n  Denmark, and born the 18th of December, 1546, of an illustrious\r\n  family. He was the first, who, by the accuracy and number of his\r\n  observations, made the way for the revival of astronomy among the\r\n  moderns; although, “in theory,” as Rittenhouse has expressed it, “he\r\n  mangled the beautiful system of Copernicus.”[20a]—Brahé (for this is\r\n  the family-name) died at the age of fifty-five years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20a:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  John Kepler, a native of Wiel in the duchy of Wirtemberg, in Germany,\r\n  became as celebrated for the consequences he drew from the\r\n  observations of Tycho, as the latter was for the vast mass of\r\n  astronomical materials he had prepared. This eminent, though somewhat\r\n  “whimsical”[21a] astronomer, was born the 27th of December, 1571, and\r\n  died at the age of fifty-nine years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21a:\r\n\r\n  _Ritt. Orat._\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  “Before his (Bacon’s) time, philosophy was fettered by forms and\r\n  syllogisms. The logics of Aristotle held the human mind in bondage for\r\n  nearly two thousand years; a miserable jugglery, which was fitted to\r\n  render all truth problematical, and which disseminated a thousand\r\n  errors, but never brought to light one useful piece of knowledge.”—Ld.\r\n  Woolhousie’s _Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Ld. Kames_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe objects of a genuine philosophy, are the discovery and promulgation\r\nof the truths which emanate from a knowledge of the laws of nature, in\r\nrelation to the material world, and the inseparable influence of those\r\ntruths, consequent on an acquaintance with them, in giving a right\r\ndirection to the moral faculty of man. The intimate connexion subsisting\r\nbetween natural and moral science, is indubitable; and it is equally\r\ncertain, that the accordant order, fitness and rectitude, which unite\r\ninto one glorious plan of wisdom, goodness and power, all portions of\r\ncreation, intellectual and sensitive as well as material, must rest on\r\nthe same unerring principles. The infinite variety and boundless extent\r\nof nature’s works constitute a sublime system; manifesting a\r\ncorrespondent perfection in the design, and all-bountiful dispensation\r\nof good in its purposes.[23] The Almighty First Cause has founded this\r\nsystem on immutable principles; wherein _truth_, in relation to the\r\nmoral world, may be considered as its basis,—as _fitness_ is, when\r\napplied to the constitution of the natural world. These are,\r\nrespectively, the correlatives of the one and the other: and the unity\r\nof design apparent in the whole system, plainly indicates the connexion\r\nthat subsists, in the nature of things, between moral virtue, which is\r\nthe result of a right perception of truth, and the fitness and order, to\r\nwhich all the operations of the material universe conform.[24]—Towards\r\nan investigation of _these_ things, the researches of the great American\r\nphilosopher were eagerly directed: such were the objects of his\r\nunwearied pursuit; and such were the views entertained by him, of the\r\nutility and importance of those sublime branches of knowledge, which he\r\ncultivated so ardently and successfully.[25]\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  It is observed by an eminent philosopher of the present day, that “The\r\n  more the phænomena of the universe are studied, the more distinctly\r\n  their connexion appears, the more simple their causes, the more\r\n  magnificent their design, and the more wonderful the wisdom and power\r\n  of their Author.” (See _Elements of Chymical Philosophy_, by sir\r\n  Humphrey Davy, LLD. Sec. R. S.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  On looking into Maclaurin’s Account of Sir Isaac Newton’s\r\n  Philosophical Discoveries, since penning the above, the writer of\r\n  these Memoirs was much gratified by the perusal of the following\r\n  passage, in the last chapter of that valuable work; wherein its author\r\n  treats “Of the Supreme Author and Governor of the Universe, the True\r\n  and Living God.” The writer is induced to add it in a note, to his own\r\n  reflections on the same subject, such as he has ventured to offer them\r\n  in the text; presuming that the authority of so eminent a philosopher\r\n  as Mr. Maclaurin will give weight to what he has himself advanced; so\r\n  far, at least, as there may appear to be some coincidence of sentiment\r\n  on the subject.\r\n\r\n  “The plain argument for the existence of the Deity, obvious to all and\r\n  carrying irresistable conviction with it, is from the evident\r\n  contrivance and fitness of things for one another, which we meet with\r\n  throughout all parts of the universe. There is no need of nice and\r\n  subtle reasonings in this matter: a manifest contrivance immediately\r\n  suggests a contriver. It strikes us like a sensation; and artful\r\n  reasonings against it may puzzle us, but it is without shaking our\r\n  belief. No person, for example, that knows the principles of optics,\r\n  and the structure of the eye, can believe that it was formed without\r\n  skill in that science; or that the ear was formed, without the\r\n  knowledge of sounds:”—“All our accounts of nature are full of\r\n  instances of this kind. The admirable and beautiful order of things,\r\n  for final causes, exalt our idea of the Contriver: the unity of design\r\n  shews him to be One. The great motions in the system, performed with\r\n  the same facility as the least, suggest his Almighty Power; which gave\r\n  motion to the earth and the celestial bodies, with equal ease as to\r\n  the minutest particles. The subtilty of the motions and actions in the\r\n  internal parts of bodies, shews that His influence penetrates the\r\n  inmost recesses of things, and that He is equally active and present\r\n  every where. The simplicity of the laws that prevail in the world, the\r\n  excellent disposition of things, in order to obtain the best ends, and\r\n  the beauty which adorns the works of nature, far superior to any thing\r\n  in art, suggest His consummate Wisdom. The usefulness of the whole\r\n  scheme, so well contrived for the intelligent beings that enjoy it,\r\n  with the internal disposition and moral structure of those beings\r\n  themselves, shew His unbounded goodness. These are arguments which are\r\n  sufficiently open to the views and capacities of the unlearned, while\r\n  at the same time they acquire new strength and lustre from the\r\n  discoveries of the learned. The Deity’s acting and interposing in the\r\n  universe, shew that He governs it, as well as formed it; and the depth\r\n  of His counsels, even in conducting the material universe, of which a\r\n  great part surpasses our knowledge, keeps up an inward veneration and\r\n  awe of this great Being, and disposes us to receive what may be\r\n  otherwise revealed to us, concerning Him.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Cotes, in his preface to the second edition of Sir Isaac Newton’s\r\n  _Principia_, exposes the folly of those depraved dreamers in\r\n  philosophy, “the sordid dregs of the most impure part of mankind,” who\r\n  strive to maintain, that the constitution of the world is not derived\r\n  from the will of God, but from a certain necessity of nature; that all\r\n  things are governed by _fate_, not by Providence; and that matter, by\r\n  _necessity of nature_, has existed always and every where, and is\r\n  infinite and eternal. He then adds:—“We may now, therefore, take a\r\n  nearer view of nature in her glory, and contemplate her in a most\r\n  entertaining manner: and withal, more zealously than ever, pay our\r\n  worship and veneration to the Creator and Lord of the Universe; _which\r\n  is the principal advantage of philosophy_. He must be blind who, from\r\n  the most excellent and most wise structure of the creatures, does not\r\n  presently see the infinite wisdom and goodness of their Creator: and\r\n  he must be mad, who will not own those attributes.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe enlightened part of the people have, in every civilized nation and\r\nin all ages, very rationally valued themselves on their great men. It is\r\nboth useful and proper to commemorate the renown of such as have\r\napproved themselves, in an eminent degree, Benefactors of Mankind. The\r\nLife, therefore, of so distinguished a Philosopher as RITTENHOUSE, must\r\nbe expected to interest the feelings, as well as the curiosity, of the\r\ngood and the wise, not only of our own country but of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the usefulness and importance of that majestic science,\r\nwhich was the favourite study and principal object of the pursuit of our\r\nphilosopher, during a life of ordinary extent but of very extraordinary\r\nattainments and character, something may with propriety be said, with a\r\nview to an illustration of the subject. And among other evidence, which,\r\nit is presumed, may not be unaptly adduced on the occasion, the\r\nMemorialist will cite in the first place, as well as occasionally\r\nafterwards, the sentiments of a distinguished foreign astronomer, whose\r\nabilities and erudition rendered him eminently qualified to decide, in a\r\ndiscussion of this nature: He shall be made to speak for himself, though\r\nnot in his own tongue; the great work from which the quoted extracts are\r\nmade, being written in French.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous and important advantages, then, resulting from\r\nastronomy, noticed by the celebrated Lalande (in the preface to his\r\nbook, entitled _Astronomie_,) he remarks that it is well known, that\r\nbesides the tendency of this science to dissipate many vulgar errors and\r\nprejudices,[26] cosmography and geography cannot go on, but by its\r\nmeans: that the discovery of the satellites of Jupiter has given greater\r\nperfection to our geographical and marine charts, than they could have\r\nattained by ten thousand years of navigation and voyages;[27] and, that\r\nwhen their theory shall become still better known, the method of\r\ndetermining the longitude at sea will be more exact and more easy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  “A man would deceive himself,” says Lalande, “in believing he could\r\n  be a philosopher, without the study of the natural sciences. To be\r\n  wise, not by weakness, but by principles, it is necessary that, to\r\n  be able to reflect and think with vigour, we be freed from those\r\n  prejudices which deceive the judgment, and which oppose themselves\r\n  to the development of reason and of genius. Pythagoras would not\r\n  have any disciples, who had not studied Mathematics: over his door\r\n  was to be read, that “no one was to enter, unless he were a\r\n  geometrician.”—Morals would be less sure, and less attractive for\r\n  us, if they were to be founded on ignorance or on error.\r\n\r\n  “Ought we,” he asks, “to consider as of no importance the advantage of\r\n  being freed from the misfortunes of ignorance? Is it possible to\r\n  observe, without a feeling of compassion and even of shame, the\r\n  stupidity of those, who formerly believed, that by making a great\r\n  vociferation, during an eclipse of the Moon, they furnished relief to\r\n  the sufferings of that (imagined) goddess; or, that these eclipses\r\n  were produced by enchantment?”\r\n\r\n             “Cum frustra resonant æra auxiliaria Lunæ.”\r\n                                                Met. iv. 333.\r\n\r\n  Reyas, in the dedication of his Commentaries on the Planisphere to the\r\n  Emperor Charles V. mentions a curious historical fact, in illustration\r\n  of the effects of that superstition, derived from ignorance, which\r\n  astronomy has banished from the civilized world. It is thus related by\r\n  Lalande:—“Christopher Columbus, when commanding the army which\r\n  Ferdinand, king of Spain, had sent to Jamaica, some short time after\r\n  the discovery of that island, experienced so great a scarcity of\r\n  provisions, that no hope remained of saving his army, which he\r\n  expected to be soon at the mercy of the savages. An approaching\r\n  eclipse of the moon furnished this able man with the means of\r\n  extricating himself from his embarrassment: he let the chief of the\r\n  savages know, that if they should not, in a few hours, send him all he\r\n  asked for, he would oppress them with the greatest calamities; and\r\n  that he would begin by depriving the moon of her light. At first, they\r\n  contemned his menaces; but, when they saw that the moon began, in\r\n  reality, to disappear, they were seized with terror; they carried all\r\n  they had to the general, and came themselves to implore forgiveness.”\r\n\r\n  Comets were formerly, even in civilized nations, another great cause\r\n  of consternation among the people; and one, also, which a knowledge of\r\n  astronomy has at length divested of its terrors, by removing the\r\n  source of those superstitious errors, a grossly mistaken notion of the\r\n  nature of those phænomena. “We are sorry to find,” says Lalande, “such\r\n  strange prejudices, not only in Homer [Iliad iv. 75.] but even in the\r\n  most beautiful poem of the sixteenth century; whereby means are\r\n  furnished of perpetuating our errors—\r\n\r\n            “Qual con le chiome sanguinose orrende\r\n            Splender Cometa suol per l’aria adusta,\r\n            Che i regni muta e i feri morbi adduce,\r\n            E ai purpurei tiranni infausta luce.”\r\n                                         _Tasso’s Jerus. del._\r\n\r\n  Which Mr. Hoole has thus translated—\r\n\r\n               “As, shaking terrors from his blazing hair,\r\n               A sanguine Comet gleams through dusky air,\r\n               To ruin states, and dire diseases spread,\r\n               And baleful light on purpled tyrants shed.”\r\n\r\n  Further, the progress of genuine astronomy has almost wholly\r\n  dissipated, in our day, the gross delusions of astrology, with the\r\n  mischievous portents of its infatuated judicial interpreters; follies\r\n  engendered by ignorance, which is, ever, the prolific parent of\r\n  prejudice, of superstition, and of their numerous concomitant evils.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse observes, (in his Oration delivered before the\r\n  American Philosophical Society, in 1775,) that “Galileo not only\r\n  discovered these moons of Jupiter, but suggested their use in\r\n  determining the longitude of places on the earth; which has since been\r\n  so happily put in practice, that Fontenelle does not hesitate to\r\n  affirm, they are of more use to geography and navigation, than our own\r\n  moon.”—This great man, one of the first restorers of the true\r\n  principles of physics, was condemned by, and suffered the penalties of\r\n  the Inquisition, in 1535, for defending the system of Copernicus! He\r\n  died in 1542.\r\n\r\n  A letter from Andrew Ellicott, Esq. to Mr. Robert Patterson, dated the\r\n  2d of April 1795, and published in the fourth volume of the American\r\n  Philosophical Society’s Transactions, contains sundry observations of\r\n  the immersions of the satellites of Jupiter, made at Wilmington in the\r\n  state of Delaware, by Messrs. Rittenhouse, J. Page, Lukens and\r\n  Andrews, respectively, on divers days from the 1st to the 23d of\r\n  August (both included,) in the year 1784; together with those observed\r\n  at the Western Observatory, by Messrs. Ellicott, Ewing, Madison, &c.\r\n  on divers days from the 17th of July to the 19th of August (both\r\n  included,) in the same year: also, of the emersions of those\r\n  satellites, by the same Eastern Observers, from the 29th of August to\r\n  the 19th of September (both included,) and by the same Western\r\n  Observers, from the 27th of August, up to the 19th of September, both\r\n  included; all in the year 1784. These observations were made,\r\n\r\n           “Le Trident de Neptune est le Sceptre du Mond.”[27a]\r\n\r\n  when those able geometricians and astronomers were employed in\r\n  ascertaining the Western Boundary of Pennsylvania, by determining the\r\n  length of five degrees of longitude, West, from a given point on the\r\n  river Delaware.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27a:\r\n\r\n  “The trident of Neptune is the sceptre of the world.”—This, as Lalande\r\n  observes, is nearly what Themistocles said at Athens, Pompey at Rome,\r\n  Cromwell in England, and Richelieu and Colbert in France.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“It is to astronomy,” says Mr. Lalande, “that we are indebted for the\r\nfirst voyages of the Phœnicians, and the earliest progress of industry\r\nand commerce: it is likewise to it, that we owe the discovery of the New\r\nWorld. If there remain any thing to desire for the perfection and\r\nsecurity of navigation, it is, to find the longitude at sea.” In\r\ncontinuation, he says:—\r\n\r\n“The utility of navigation for the welfare of a state, serves to prove\r\nthat of astronomy. But it seems to me, that it is difficult for a good\r\ncitizen to be ignorant, now, of the usefulness of navigation; above all,\r\n(says Lalande, feelingly,) in France. The success of the English, in the\r\nwar of 1764, has but too well shewn, that a marine alone governs the\r\nfortune of empires, their power, their commerce; that peace and war are\r\ndecided on the ocean; and that, in fine, as Mr. Miere has expressed it,—\r\n\r\n“Ancient chronology deduces, from a knowledge and calculation of\r\neclipses, the best established periods in time, that it is possible to\r\nobtain: and in ages anterior to regular observations, nothing but\r\nobscurity is to be met with. We should not have in the history of\r\nnations any uncertainty in dates, if there had always been astronomers.\r\nWe may perceive, above all, the connexions of astronomy in _The Art of\r\nverifying Dates_. It is by an eclipse of the Moon,[28] that we discover\r\nthe error of date that exists in the vulgar era with respect to the\r\nbirth of Christ. It is known that Herod was king of Judea, and that\r\nthere was an eclipse of the moon immediately before the death of that\r\nprince: we find this eclipse was in the night, between the 12th and 13th\r\nof March, of the fourth year before the vulgar era; so that this era\r\nought to be removed three years back, at least.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Derham, speaking of the utility resulting from the observation of\r\n  these phænomena, (in his _Astro-Theology_,) says—“As to the eclipses,\r\n  whether of sun or moon, they have their excellent uses. The astronomer\r\n  applies them to considerable services, in his way, and the geographer\r\n  makes them no less useful in his: the chronologer is enabled, by them,\r\n  to amend his accounts of time, even of the most ancient days; and so\r\n  down through all ages: and the mariner, too, can make them serviceable\r\n  to his purpose, to discover his longitude, to correct his account at\r\n  sea, and thereby make himself more secure and safe in the untrodden\r\n  paths of the deep.”\r\n\r\n                                                                   W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“It is besides from astronomy, that we borrow the division of time in\r\nthe common transactions of life, and the art of regulating clocks and\r\nwatches. We may say, that the order and the multiplicity of our affairs,\r\nof our duties, our amusements; the attachment to exactness and\r\nprecision; in short, our habits; all have rendered this measure of time\r\nalmost indispensable, and placed it among the number of the _desiderata_\r\nof human life.\r\n\r\n“If, for want of clocks and watches, we should be under the necessity of\r\nrecurring to meridians and sundials, even this would further prove the\r\nadvantages derived from astronomical science; since dialling is only an\r\napplication of spherical trigonometry and astronomy.\r\n\r\n“Le Sage is displeased with good reason with those, whom an admiration\r\nof the stars has carried so far, as that they fancied them to be\r\nDeities:[29] but, far from condemning the study of them, he recommends\r\nit, for the glory of the Creator.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  Lucius Cælius Lactantius Firmianus, a Christian writer in the\r\n  beginning of the fourth century, reasons in a conclusive manner\r\n  against the heathen mythology, in the inference he draws from the\r\n  argument, used by the heathens, to prove the heavenly bodies to be\r\n  divinities. His argument, on this head, will be found towards the\r\n  conclusion of Mr. Derham’s _Astro-Theology_, where it is translated\r\n  from the Latin of that early and eloquent advocate of Christianity (in\r\n  his _Divin. Instit._ l. 2. c. 5.) in these words:—\r\n\r\n  “That argument whereby they” (those idolaters) “conclude the heavenly\r\n  bodies to be gods, proveth the contrary: for if therefore they think\r\n  them to be gods, because they have such certain and well-contrived\r\n  rational courses, they err: for, from hence it appears that they are\r\n  not gods; because they are not able to wander out of those paths that\r\n  are prescribed them. Whereas, if they were gods, they would go here\r\n  and there, and every where, without any restraint, like as animals\r\n  upon the earth do; whose wills being free, they wander hither and\r\n  thither, as they list, and go whithersoever their minds carry them.”\r\n\r\n  Those vast orbs of matter in the universe, which constitute the\r\n  planets of our system, if even we consider this alone, and each of\r\n  which is known to have its appropriate motion, must of necessity have\r\n  had those motions communicated to them, at first, by some Being of\r\n  infinite power; the perfect order and regularity of their motions\r\n  render it equally plain, that that Being was also infinite in wisdom;\r\n  and the uninterrupted continuance of the same regularity of motion, in\r\n  their respective orbits, demonstrates in like manner, that He who\r\n  originally imparted their motions to the several planets is, moreover,\r\n  infinite in duration.\r\n\r\n  The _vis inertiæ_ of all _material_ substances, a quality inseparably\r\n  interwoven with their nature, deprives them (considered merely as\r\n  such) of the power of spontaneous motion; matter is inherently\r\n  _inert_: consequently, those great globes of matter, the planets\r\n  (including the earth,) necessarily derive their motions from a\r\n  supremely powerful First Cause, as well as from one infinitely\r\n  intelligent, and everlasting in his Being. Hence, Lactantius well\r\n  observes, in another place, that “There is, indeed, a power in the\r\n  stars, of performing their motions; but that is the power of God, who\r\n  made and governs all things; not of the stars themselves, that are\r\n  moved.”\r\n\r\n  The reasoning of Lactantius, on this subject, is more worthy of a\r\n  philosopher, than that employed by Descartes, in supporting his\r\n  chimerical notion of vortices; or than that which led Kepler to adopt\r\n  his scheme, equally unsupported by any rational principles, of a\r\n  vectorial power produced by emanations of the sun, as primary agents\r\n  of motion in the solar system. Because these schemes of Descartes and\r\n  Kepler make it necessary to recur to some ulterior, as well as more\r\n  adequate and comprehensible cause of motion, in the planets, than\r\n  either vortices or emanations from the sun: whereas Lactantius\r\n  resorted, at once, to an intelligent First Cause, capable of producing\r\n  the effect; without conjuring up inefficient agents, as first movers;\r\n  which left them still under the necessity of going back to a CREATOR\r\n  of their respective causes (but second causes, at best,) of the\r\n  planetary motions; consequently, the First Cause; and, also, of\r\n  admitting the existence of Intelligence, as an essential attribute in\r\n  the nature of that Being.\r\n\r\n  An edition of the works of Lactantius (who was a native of Fermo in\r\n  Italy,) was printed at Leipsick, in 1715.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAdverting to such as considered “fire, or wind, or the swift air, or the\r\ncircle of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights of heaven, to\r\nbe gods which govern the world,”[30] he applies the words of\r\nSolomon:—“With whose beauty, if they, being delighted, took them to be\r\ngods; let them know how much better the Lord of them is: for the first\r\nAuthor of beauty has created them—For, by the greatness and beauty of\r\nthe creatures, proportionably the Maker of them is seen.”[31]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Wisdom of Solomon, ch. 13. v. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  Ibid. ch. 13. v. 3 and 5.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“David found also, in the stars,” continues Lalande, “means of elevating\r\nhis contemplation of the Deity:”—“The heavens declare the glory of\r\nGod;”[32] “I will view thy heavens, the works of thy fingers, the moon\r\nand the stars which thou hast established:” and we see that Mr. Derham\r\nhas called by the name of “_Astro-Theology_,” a work, in which is\r\npresented, in all their force, the singularity and grandeur of the\r\ndiscoveries that have been made in astronomy; as being so many proofs of\r\nthe existence of a God. (See what Aristotle thought on this subject, in\r\nthe eighth book of his _Physics_.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Psalm 19. v. 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch were the reflections of Mr. Lalande, on a subject with which he was\r\nintimately acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of eminent and enlightened men have deservedly great\r\nweight, in all those matters on which it is presumable, from the nature\r\nof their pursuits, their thoughts have been most employed.\r\nNotwithstanding, therefore, the fulness of the foregoing extracts, the\r\nwriter believes that the very apt and judicious observations contained\r\nin the following passage, in support of similar sentiments, extracted\r\nfrom a voluminous work of a distinguished English astronomer, of the\r\npresent day, will not be deemed to have been improperly brought into\r\nview, on this occasion:—\r\n\r\n“The obvious argument of the existence of a DEITY, who formed and\r\ngoverns the universe,” (says Mr. Vince, the author referred to,) “is\r\nfounded upon the uniformity of the laws which take place in the\r\nproduction of similar effects; and from the simplicity of the causes\r\nwhich produce the various phænomena. The most common views of nature,\r\nhowever imperfect and of small extent, suggest the idea of the\r\ngovernment of a GOD, and every further discovery tends to confirm that\r\npersuasion. The ancient philosophers, who scarce knew a single law by\r\nwhich the bodies in the system are governed, still saw the DEITY in his\r\nworks: how visible therefore ought He to be to us, who are acquainted\r\nwith the laws by which the whole is directed. The same law takes place\r\nin our system, between the periodic times and distances of every body\r\nrevolving about the same centre. Every body describes about its\r\nrespective centre equal areas in equal times. Every body is spherical.\r\nEvery planet, as far as our observations reach, is found to revolve\r\nabout an axis; and the axis of each is observed to continue parallel to\r\nitself. Now as the circumstances which might have attended these bodies\r\nare indefinite in variety, the uniform similarity which is found to\r\nexist amongst them, is an irrefragable argument of design. To produce a\r\nsuccession of day and night, either the sun must revolve every day about\r\nthe earth, or the earth must revolve about its axis: the latter is the\r\nmost simple cause; and, accordingly, we find that the regular return of\r\nday and night is so produced. As far also as observations have enabled\r\nus to discover, the return of day and night, in the planets, is produced\r\nby the operation of a similar cause. It is also found, that the axis of\r\neach planet is inclined to the plane of its orbit, by which a provision\r\nis made for a variety of seasons; and by preserving the axis always\r\nparallel to itself, summer and winter return at their stated periods.\r\nWhere there are such incontestable marks of design, there must be a\r\nDESIGNER; and the unity of design through the whole system, proves it to\r\nbe the work of ONE. The general laws of nature shew the existence of a\r\nDivine INTELLIGENCE, in a much stronger point of view, than any work of\r\nman can prove him to have acted from intention; inasmuch as the\r\noperations of the former are uniform, and subject to no variation;\r\nwhereas in the latter case, we see continual alterations of plan, and\r\ndeviations from established rules. And without this permanent order of\r\nthings, experience could not have directed man in respect to his future\r\noperations. These fixed laws of nature, so necessary for us, is an\r\nirresistible argument that the world is the work of a wise and\r\nbenevolent BEING. The laws of nature are the laws of GOD; and how far\r\nsoever we may be able to trace up causes, they must terminate in his\r\nwill. We see nothing in the heavens which argues imperfection; the whole\r\ncreation is stamped with the marks of DIVINITY.”—[See _A Complete System\r\nof Astronomy_; by the Rev. S. Vince, A. M. F. R. S. &c. printed at\r\nCambridge, in 1799—vol. ii. p. 290, 291.]\r\n\r\nNone of the works of creation present to the contemplation of man\r\nobjects more worthy of the dignity of his nature, than those which\r\nengage the attention of the astronomer. They have, interested men of the\r\nsublimest genius, in all ages of the world: and the science of astronomy\r\nis spoken of with admiration, by the most celebrated sages of antiquity.\r\n\r\nAlthough no astronomer of our day, how enthusiastic soever he may be in\r\nfavour of his science, will be disposed to say with Anaxagoras, that the\r\npurpose for which he himself or any other man was born, was, that he\r\nmight contemplate the stars; yet it does seem, as if the objects of this\r\nscience more naturally attracted the attention and employed the research\r\nof elevated minds, than those things, within the narrow limits of this\r\nworld, an acquaintance with which constitutes the ordinary mass of human\r\nknowledge. The disposition of man to direct his eyes frequently upwards,\r\nand the faculty to do so, arising from his erect figure and the position\r\nand structure of the organs of his vision, furnish no feeble argument in\r\nproving, that this temporary lord of his fellow-beings on this globe has\r\nnobler destinies, infinitely beyond them; being enabled and permitted by\r\nthe Author of his being, even while in this circumscribed state of his\r\nexistence, to survey those myriads of worlds which occupy the immensity\r\nof space; to contemplate their nature, and the laws that govern them;\r\nthence, to discern, with the eye of reason, the Great First Cause of\r\ntheir being;[33] and thus having acquired, a juster knowledge of his own\r\nnature, to grasp at an endless futurity for its existence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  In Mr. Smart’s _Poetical Essay on the Immensity of the Supreme Being_,\r\n  after a glowing description of some of the admirable works of nature,\r\n  is this apt, though laconic address to the Atheist:—\r\n\r\n               “Thou ideot! that asserts, there is no God,\r\n               _View_, and be dumb for ever.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThat the erect countenance and upward aspect of the human species were\r\nhis peculiar endowments by the Deity, for these purposes among others,\r\nappears to have been the impression on the mind of Ovid, when he said:—\r\n\r\n         “Finxit in effigiem moderantum cuncta deorum;\r\n         Pronaque cum spectent animalia cætera terram,\r\n         Os homini sublime dedit, cælumque tueri\r\n         Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus.”[34]\r\n                                                  _Met._ i. 88.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  The poet gives a whimsical account of the first formation of man, out\r\n  of this earth, which is represented as being then new; and, having\r\n  been recently separated from the high æther, is therefore supposed as\r\n  yet holding some affinity with heaven, and retaining its seeds. He\r\n  describes the son of Japetus (Prometheus) moulding a portion of earth,\r\n  mixed with river-water, into the similitude of those heathen deities,\r\n  who were said to rule over all things.\r\n\r\n  A poetic translation into our own language, of the lines above quoted,\r\n  which exhibit “the godlike image,” thus formed, after its being\r\n  animated by the stolen fire of Prometheus, is comprehended in the\r\n  _italicised_ lines of the following passage, extracted from Mr.\r\n  Dryden’s versification of the first book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses; in\r\n  which the English poet has well preserved the beauty, the force, and\r\n  the sublimity of the thought, so finely expressed in the original:—\r\n\r\n         “A creature of a more exalted kind\r\n         Was wanting yet, and then was _Man_ design’d\r\n         Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast,\r\n         For empire form’d, and fit to rule the rest:\r\n         Whether with particles of heav’nly fire\r\n         The God of nature did his soul inspire;\r\n         Or earth, but now divided from the sky,\r\n         And pliant still, retain’d th’ ætherial energy:\r\n         Which wise _Prometheus_ temper’d into paste,\r\n         And, mixt with living streams, _the godlike image cast_:\r\n         _Thus, while the mute creation downward bend\r\n         Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,\r\n         Man looks aloft, and with erected eyes\r\n         Beholds his own hereditary skies_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMr. Pope has well observed, that—\r\n\r\n                “The proper study of mankind, is Man:”—\r\n\r\nBut, in order that he may be enabled to know himself, it is\r\nindispensably necessary for him to acquire such a knowledge of other\r\ncreated beings that surround him, as the limited nature of his faculties\r\nwill allow. He must attentively observe the operations of nature in the\r\nmaterial universe, survey with a reflecting mind its stupendous fabric,\r\nand study its laws. Hence, he will be made acquainted, and although in a\r\npartial, yet not an inconsiderable degree, with the powers and extent of\r\nthat intellectual principle which he finds in the government of the\r\nmoral, as well as the natural world. And being thus enabled to know his\r\nown proper standing in creation, and his appropriate relation to all its\r\nparts, he will by these means be qualified to ascend to those enquiries,\r\nwhich will open to his mind a just sense of the attributes of the Deity,\r\nof whose existence he will feel a perfect conviction. In this way, will\r\nman obtain a due knowledge of his own “being, end and aim;” and become\r\nfully sensible of his entire dependence on his Creator: while he will\r\nthereby learn, that he incessantly owes him the highest adoration and\r\nthe most devoted service.[35] In this way it is, that the philosopher,\r\nmore especially the astronomer,—\r\n\r\n       “Looks, through Nature, up to Nature’s God.”[36]\r\n                                           _Pope’s Ess. on Man._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Man will, unquestionably, by taking an extensive range in the\r\n  contemplation of nature, proportionably enlarge his intuitive\r\n  conceptions of the attributes of her Almighty First Cause; of whose\r\n  transcendently exalted existence, the study of his own being, one of\r\n  nature’s greatest works, will have taught him the reality: and a due\r\n  knowledge of himself, alone, will also instruct him in the dependent\r\n  nature of his condition, and the duties resulting from that state of\r\n  dependence, in his humble relation to the Supreme being.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Smart, in the poem before quoted, has prettily expressed this\r\n  idea, in the following lines:—\r\n\r\n              “Vain were th’ attempt, and impious, to trace\r\n              Thro’ _all_ his works th’ Artificer Divine—\r\n              And tho’ no shining sun, nor twinkling star,\r\n              Bedeck’d the crimson curtains of the sky;\r\n              Tho’ neither vegetable, beast, nor bird,\r\n              Were extant on the surface of this ball,\r\n              Nor lurking gem beneath; tho’ the great sea\r\n              Slept in profound stagnation, and the air\r\n              Had left no thunder to pronounce its Maker;\r\n              Yet Man at home, _within himself_, might find\r\n              The Deity immense; and, in that frame\r\n              So fearfully, so wonderfully made,\r\n              See and adore his Providence and Pow’r.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  The same sentiment is beautifully expressed by Thomson, in the\r\n  following apostrophe:\r\n\r\n          “With thee, serene Philosophy! with thee,\r\n          And thy bright garland, let me crown my song!\r\n          Effusive source of evidence, and truth!\r\n          A lustre shedding o’er th’ ennobled mind,\r\n          Stronger than summer-noon; and pure as that,\r\n          Whose mild vibrations soothe the parted soul,\r\n          New to the dawning of celestial day.\r\n          Hence through her nourish’d pow’rs, enlarged by thee,\r\n          She springs aloft, with elevated pride,\r\n          Above the tangling mass of low desires,\r\n          That bind the fluttering crowd; and angel-wing’d,\r\n          The heights of science and of virtue gains,\r\n          Where all is calm and clear; with nature round,\r\n          Or in the starry regions, or th’ abyss,\r\n          To reason’s or to fancy’s eye display’d:\r\n          The _First_ up-tracing, from the dreary void,\r\n          The chain of causes and effects to Him,\r\n          The world producing essence, who alone\r\n          Possesses being; while the _Last_ receives\r\n          The whole magnificence of heaven and earth,\r\n          And every beauty, delicate or bold,\r\n          Obvious or more remote, with livelier sense,\r\n          Diffusive painted on the rapid mind.”\r\n                            _Summer_, l. 1729 and seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBesides the various and important uses of astronomy, here pointed out,\r\nit is connected, by means of numerous ramifications, with other\r\ndepartments of science, directed to some of the most useful pursuits of\r\nhuman life. Lalande has even shewn us, in the preface to his\r\n_Astronomie_, in what manner this science has a relation to the\r\nadministration of civil and ecclesiastical affairs, to medicine, and to\r\nagriculture. A knowledge of astronomy is obviously connected, by means\r\nof chronology, with history. It is even a necessary study, in order to\r\nbecome acquainted with the heathen mythology; and many beautiful\r\npassages in the works of the ancient poets can neither be distinctly\r\nunderstood nor properly relished, without a knowledge of the stars: nay,\r\nthat finely poetical one, in the book of Job, in which the Deity is\r\nrepresented as manifesting to that patient man of affliction and sorrow\r\nthe extreme imbecility of his nature, is unintelligible without some\r\nknowledge of astronomy:—\r\n\r\n “Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of\r\n    Orion?—\r\n Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season; or canst thou guide\r\n    Arcturus, with his sons?”\r\n\r\nSome of the greatest poets of antiquity were in a manner fascinated, by\r\nthe grandeur of that science, (though they accompanied it with mystical\r\nnotions,) which furnishes the sublimest objects in nature to the\r\ncontemplation of the astronomer.\r\n\r\nOvid tells us, he wished to take his flight among the stars:\r\n\r\n                      —-—-—“Juvat ire per alta\r\n        Astra; juvat, terris et inerti sede relictis,\r\n        Nube vehi, validique humeris insistere Atlantis.”[37]\r\n                                           _Metamorph._ lib. xv.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  It delights me to soar among the lofty stars; it delights me to leave\r\n  the earth and this dull habitation, to be wafted upon a cloud, and to\r\n  stand upon the shoulders of the mighty Atlas.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Dryden has thus translated the original into English verse:—\r\n\r\n              “Pleas’d, as I am, to walk along the sphere\r\n              Of shining stars, and travel with the year;\r\n              To leave the heavy earth, and scale the height\r\n              Of Atlas, who supports the heavenly weight.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnd Horace acquaints us with the objects of curiosity and research, in\r\nthe contemplation of which he envied his friend Iccius, who was occupied\r\nin that way, on his farm:—\r\n\r\n        “Quæ mare compescant causæ, quid temperet annum;\r\n        Stellæ sponte suâ, jussæne, vagentur et errant,\r\n        Quid premat obscurum Lunæ, quid proferat orbem.”[38]\r\n                                Lib. i. epist. 12, ad _Iccium_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Francis thus versifies this passage, in our language:—\r\n\r\n                  ————“What bounds old ocean’s tides;\r\n           What, through the various year, the seasons guides:\r\n           Whether the stars, by their own proper force,\r\n           Or foreign pow’r, pursue their wand’ring course:\r\n           Why shadows darken the pale Queen of Night;\r\n           Whence she renews her orb, and spreads her light.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nVirgil seemed willing to renounce every other study, in order that he\r\nmight devote himself to the wonders of astronomy. In the second book of\r\nhis Georgics, he says:\r\n\r\n        “Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musæ,\r\n        Quarum sacra fero, ingenti perculsus amore,\r\n        Accipiant; cælique vias et sidera monstrent,\r\n        Defectus Solis varius, Lunæque labores;\r\n        Unde tremor terris, quâ vi maria alta tumescant\r\n        Obicibus ruptis, rursusque in se ipsa residant;\r\n        Quid tantum oceano properent se tingere soles\r\n        Hyberni, vel quæ tardis mora noctibus obstet—\r\n        Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.”[39]\r\n                                                 l. 475 and seq.\r\n\r\nAnd, in addition to these classical writers, a modern poet (Mr.\r\nVoltaire) appears, by a letter written in the year 1738, to have\r\nparticipated in the regrets expressed by Virgil; and to have been\r\ndesirous of directing all his faculties towards the sciences. He\r\nproduced, on the philosophy of Newton, a work which has contributed to\r\nthe expansion of genius; and, in his epistle to the Marchioness du\r\nChatelet, he pays that great man a very exalted compliment, in these\r\npoetic lines:\r\n\r\n        “Confidens du Tres Haut, substances eternelles,\r\n        Qui parez de vos feux, qui couvrez de vos ailes\r\n        Le trône oú votre Maitre est assis parmi vous;\r\n        Parlez: Du grand Newton n’étiez-vous point jaloux?”[40]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Thus rendered, in English verse, by Mr. Dryden:—\r\n\r\n            “Ye sacred Muses, with whose beauty fir’d,\r\n            My soul is ravish’d, and my brain inspir’d;\r\n            Whose priest I am, whose holy fillets wear,\r\n            Would you your poet’s first petition hear;\r\n            Give me the way of wand’ring stars to know:\r\n            The depths of heav’n above, and earth below.\r\n            Teach me the various labours of the moon,\r\n            And whence proceed th’ eclipses of the sun.\r\n            Why flowing tides prevail upon the main,\r\n            And in what dark recess they sink again.\r\n            What shakes the solid earth, what cause delays\r\n            The summer nights, and shortens winter days—\r\n            Happy the man, who, studying nature’s laws,\r\n            Through known effects can trace the secret cause.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  The lines here referred to were written about eight years after Sir\r\n  Isaac Newton’s death. Voltaire supposes an apotheosis of Newton to\r\n  have taken place, among the planets personified by some of the deities\r\n  of the heathen mythology. Thus ascribing intelligence to the stars, he\r\n  considers them, by a poetical fiction, as being in the _confidence_ of\r\n  the Most High—the _true_ God; and to those subordinate deities, or,\r\n  perhaps, a fancied superior order of angelic beings, the poet makes\r\n  his figurative address; which may be thus rendered in English verse:—\r\n\r\n               Ye confidents of the Most High,\r\n                 Ye everlasting lights!\r\n               Who deck, with your refulgent fires,\r\n                 The scene of godlike rights!\r\n               Whose wings o’erspread the glorious throne\r\n                 Whereon your Lord is plac’d,\r\n               That Lord, by whose transcendent pow’r\r\n                 Your borrow’d rays are grac’d;\r\n               Speak out, bright orbs of heaven’s expanse!\r\n                 And frankly let us know:\r\n               To the exalted NEWTON’S name,\r\n                 Can you refuse to bow?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAstronomy has not only engaged the attention of multitudes of\r\nillustrious men, of every age and nation, but it has been patronized by\r\ngreat and enlightened princes and states; cultivated by men of genius\r\nand learning, of all ranks and professions; and celebrated by historians\r\nand poets.\r\n\r\nThis charming, as well as sublime and invaluable science, has also been\r\nstudied, and even practically cultivated, by many celebrated women, in\r\nmodern times. There are indeed circumstances connected with this\r\ninnocent and engaging pursuit, that must render it very interesting to\r\nthe fair sex. Some ladies have prosecuted this object with such success,\r\nas to acquire considerable distinction in the philosophical world.\r\nWhile, therefore, the meritorious transactions of men are held in\r\ngrateful remembrance and frequently recorded in the annals of fame, it\r\nis due to justice and impartiality, that literary, scientific, and other\r\nattainments of the gentler sex, calculated for the benefit of civil\r\nsociety, should be alike commemorated. Among such then, as examples, may\r\nbe named the following:—\r\n\r\nMaria Cunitia (Kunitz,) daughter of a physician in Silesia, published\r\nAstronomical Tables, so early as the year 1650.\r\n\r\nMaria-Clara, the daughter of Eimmart and wife of of Muller, both\r\nwell-known astronomers, cultivated the same science.\r\n\r\nJane Dumée published, in the year 1680, Conversations (or Dialogues) on\r\nthe Copernican System.\r\n\r\nMaria-Margaretta Winckelman, wife of Godfrey Kirch, an astronomer of\r\nsome distinction[41] who died in 1710, at the age of seventy-one years,\r\nworked at his Ephemerides, and carried on Astronomical Observations with\r\nher husband. This respectable woman discovered the Comet[42] of 1702, on\r\nthe 20th of April in that year: she produced, in 1712, a Work on\r\nAstronomy; and died at Berlin, in the year 1720. Her three daughters\r\ncontinued, for thirty years, to employ themselves in Astronomical\r\nObservations, for the Almanacks of Berlin.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Godfrey Kirch was born in the year 1640, at Guben in Lower Lusatia,\r\n  and lived with Hevelius. He published his Ephemerides in 1681, and\r\n  became established at Berlin in 1700. This astronomer made numerous\r\n  observations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n                    —-—-—“Amid the radiant orbs\r\n          That mere than deck, that animate the sky,\r\n          The life-infusing suns of other worlds,\r\n          Lo! from the dread immensity of space\r\n          Returning with accelerated course,\r\n          The rushing Comet to the sun descends;\r\n          And, as he sinks below the shading earth,\r\n          With awful train projected o’er the heavens,\r\n          The guilty nations tremble. But, above\r\n          Those superstitious horrors that enslave\r\n          The fond sequacious herd, to mystic faith\r\n          And blind amazement prone, th’ enlighten’d few,\r\n          Whose godlike minds Philosophy exalts,\r\n          The glorious stranger hail. They feel a joy\r\n          Divinely great; they in their powers exult;\r\n          That wond’rous force of thought, which mounting spurns\r\n          This dusky spot, and measures all the sky;\r\n          While, from his far excursions through the wilds\r\n          Of barren ether, faithful to his time,\r\n          They see the blazing wonder rise anew,\r\n          In seeming terror clad, but kindly bent\r\n          To work the will of all-sustaining love:\r\n          From his huge vapoury train perhaps to shake\r\n          Renewing moisture on the numerous orbs,\r\n          Through which his long elipsis winds; perhaps\r\n          To lend new fuel to declining suns,\r\n          To light up worlds, and feed th’ eternal fire.”\r\n\r\n          _Thomson’s Summer_, l. 1702 and seq.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nElizabeth d’Oginsky Puzynina, Countess Puzynina and Castellane of\r\nMscislau, in Poland, erected and richly endowed a magnificent\r\nObservatory at Wilna, in the year 1753; and in 1767, she added to this\r\nestablishment a fund equivalent to twelve thousand (American) dollars,\r\nfor the purpose of maintaining an observer and purchasing instruments.\r\nThe king of Poland afterwards gave to this institution the title of a\r\n“Royal Observatory.”\r\n\r\nThe wife of the celebrated Hevelius was, likewise, an astronomer. Madame\r\nHevelius made Observations along with her husband; and she is\r\nrepresented, in the _Machina Cœlestis_, as having been engaged in\r\nmeasuring distances.\r\n\r\nIn the century just passed, the Marchioness du Chatelet translated\r\n_Newton_: Besides whom,—\r\n\r\nMadame Lepaute and Madame du Piery were both known in the Astronomical\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nIn our own time, Miss Caroline Herschel, sister of the great practical\r\nastronomer of the same name, in England, has not only distinguished\r\nherself, by having discovered the Comet of 1786; another, on the 17th of\r\nApril, 1790; and a third, on the 8th of October, 1793;[43] but likewise\r\nby attending to Astronomical Observations, along with her brother, for\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Messier observed this Comet in France, eleven days before it was\r\n  discovered in England by Miss Herschel.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo these may be added the name of an illustrious female; Elizabeth,\r\neldest daughter of Frederick V. Count Palatine of the Rhine and King of\r\nBohemia, by the only daughter of James I. This Princess (who was an aunt\r\nof King George I.) cultivated a fine genius for the several branches of\r\nnatural philosophy, and was well versed in mathematical science.\r\nAlthough this excellent woman was a Protestant, she was Abbess of\r\nHerworden in Westphalia, where she died in 1680, at the age of sixty-two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMr. Lalande, in the prefatory department of his great work on\r\n_Astronomy_, after noticing the Abbé Pluche’s book, entitled _Spectacle\r\nde la Nature_, says: “The freshness of the shade, the stillness of\r\nnight, the soft beams of twilight, the luminaries that bespangle the\r\nheavens, the various appearances of the moon, all form in the hands of\r\nPluche a fit subject for fine descriptive colouring: it takes in view\r\nall the wants of man, regards the attention of the Supreme Being to\r\nthose wants, and recognizes the glory of the Creator. His book is a\r\ntreatise on final causes, as well as a philosophical work; and there are\r\na great many young persons to whom the reading of it would afford\r\nsatisfaction and pleasure.” Observing that he himself had no object in\r\nview, in his own work, but merely to treat of Astronomy, Lalande\r\nrecommends to his readers, _Nature Displayed_, Derham’s\r\n_Astro-Theology_, and the Dialogues of Fontenelle on _The Plurality of\r\nWorlds_. Such works as these, with some elementary books on astronomy\r\nand those branches of science most intimately connected with that\r\nscience, would be very proper for the study of that respectable class of\r\nfemales, whose minds are too elevated and correct to derive any\r\ngratification from the trifling productions of most of the modern\r\nnovellists and romance-writers; but who, at the same time, might not be\r\ndesirous of engaging in the more abstruse and laborious researches,\r\nwhich demand the attention of profound practical astronomers.[44] The\r\ngrand, the delightful views of nature, which studies of this sort would\r\npresent to the vivid imagination, the delicate sensibility, and the good\r\ndispositions of a woman of genius and refinement, would not only improve\r\nher understanding and sanction the best feelings of her heart, but they\r\nwould furnish her mind with an inexhaustible fund of animating\r\nreflections and rational enjoyments: in every respect, indeed, they\r\nwould contribute to her happiness.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  That the mind of the female sex is capable of compassing great and\r\n  extraordinary attainments, even in the most arduous branches of\r\n  science, is attested by many instances; and it cannot be doubted that\r\n  these would be more numerous, were women oftener attentive to\r\n  philosophical pursuits. Those who have been just named serve to shew,\r\n  that astronomy has been cultivated with success, by them. And Dr. Reid\r\n  tells us (in his _Essays on the intellectual and active Powers of\r\n  Man_,) that both the celebrated Christiana, Queen of Sweden, and the\r\n  Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Frederick, King of Bohemia, and aunt\r\n  of George I., were adepts in the philosophy of Descartes. The latter\r\n  of these princesses, though very young when Descartes wrote his\r\n  _Principia_, was declared by that philosopher to be the only person he\r\n  knew, who perfectly understood not only all his philosophical\r\n  writings, but the most abstruse of his mathematical works.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nLet not, then, the beauties of astronomical science, and the captivating\r\nstudies of natural philosophy in general, be exclusively enjoyed by men;\r\nbut let the amiable, the intelligent, and the improved part of the\r\nfemale sex, be invited to a participation, with them, in these\r\nintellectual pleasures.[45]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  The writer is happy in having it in his power to cite, in support of\r\n  his own opinion, that of an amiable and conspicuous female, in favour\r\n  of ladies making themselves acquainted with, at least, the rudiments\r\n  of astronomical science.\r\n\r\n  The Countess of Carlisle, a woman whose literary attainments, as well\r\n  as virtues and accomplishments, do honour to her sex and station, in\r\n  her Letters, under the signature of _Cornelia_, thus recommends an\r\n  attention to the study of astronomy, to the young ladies to whom her\r\n  letters are addressed. “Attain a competent knowledge of the globe on\r\n  which you live, that your apprehension of Infinite Wisdom may be\r\n  enlarged; which it will be in a much higher degree, if you take care\r\n  to acquire a general idea of the structure of the universe. It is not\r\n  expected you should become adepts in astronomy; but a knowledge of its\r\n  leading principles you may, and ought to obtain.”—Her ladyship then\r\n  refers her young female correspondents to the _Plurality of Worlds_ of\r\n  Fontenelle, in order that they might acquire a knowledge of the\r\n  planetary orbs; pleasantly recommending this author as a proper\r\n  person, in the capacity of “a gentleman usher,” to “introduce” them to\r\n  an “acquaintance” with “that brilliant assembly.”\r\n\r\n                                   _Lady Carlisle’s Letters_, lett. 8th.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, might be rested the evidence of the all-important\r\nusefulness of that branch of knowledge, in which our American\r\nPhilosopher was pre-eminently distinguished.\r\n\r\nBut, inasmuch as astronomy forms a part of mathematical science, more\r\nespecially of those branches of it, which, under the denomination of\r\nmixed and practical mathematics, are intimately and inseparably\r\ninterwoven, every where, with physical considerations, the reader will,\r\nit is presumed, be gratified by a perusal of the following admirable\r\ndescription of the Uses of Mathematics, extracted from the great Dr.\r\nBarrow’s _Prefatory Oration_,[46] upon his admission into the\r\nProfessorship, at Cambridge. Indeed, in writing the Life of a man so\r\neminently skilled as Dr. Rittenhouse was, in the several departments or\r\nvarious branches of natural philosophy, it seems proper and useful to\r\nexhibit to the reader such views as have been furnished by men of\r\nrenowned erudition, of the nature and importance of that complicated,\r\nthat widely-extended science, in the cultivation of which our\r\nphilosopher held so exalted a rank.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  Translated from the Latin.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Barrow[47] thus eulogizes the Mathematics—a science “which depends\r\nupon principles clear to the mind, and agreeable to experience; which\r\ndraws certain conclusions, instructs by profitable rules, unfolds\r\npleasant questions, and produces wonderful effects: which is the\r\nfruitful parent of—I had almost said—all arts, the unshaken foundation\r\nof sciences, and the plentiful fountain of advantage to human affairs:\r\nIn which last respect we may be said to receive from mathematics the\r\nprincipal delights of life, securities of health, increase of fortune\r\nand conveniences of labour: That we dwell elegantly and commodiously,\r\nbuild decent houses for ourselves, erect stately temples to God, and\r\nleave wonderful monuments to posterity: That we are protected by those\r\nrampires from the incursions of an enemy, rightly use arms, artfully\r\nmanage war, and skilfully range an army: That we have safe traffic\r\nthrough the deceitful billows, pass in a direct road through the\r\ntrackless ways of the sea, and arrive at the designed ports by the\r\nuncertain impulse of the winds: That we rightly cast up our accounts, do\r\nbusiness expeditiously, dispose, tabulate, and calculate scattered ranks\r\nof numbers, and easily compute them, though expressive of huge heaps of\r\nsand, nay immense hills of atoms: That we make pacific separations of\r\nthe bounds of lands, examine the momentums of weights in an equal\r\nbalance, and are enabled to distribute to every one his own by a just\r\nmeasure: That, with a light touch, we thrust forward bodies, which way\r\nwe will, and step a huge resistance with a very small force: That we\r\naccurately delineate the face of this earthly orb, and subject the\r\neconomy of the universe to our sight: That we aptly digest the flowing\r\nseries of time; distinguish what is acted, by due intervals; rightly\r\naccount and discern the various returns of the seasons; the stated\r\nperiods of the years and months, the alternate increasements of days and\r\nnights, the doubtful limits of light and shadow, and the exact\r\ndifference of hours and minutes: That we derive the solar virtue of the\r\nsun’s rays to our uses, infinitely extend the sphere of light, enlarge\r\nthe near appearances of objects, bring remote objects near, discover\r\nhidden things, trace nature out of her concealments, and unfold her dark\r\nmysteries: That we delight our eyes with beautiful images, cunningly\r\nimitate the devices and portray the works of nature; imitate, did I say?\r\nnay excel; while we form to ourselves things not in being, exhibit\r\nthings absent, and represent things past: That we recreate our minds,\r\nand delight our ears, with melodious sounds; attemperate the inconstant\r\nundulations of the air to musical tones; add a pleasant voice to a\r\nsapless log; and draw a sweet eloquence from a rigid metal; celebrate\r\nour Maker with an harmonious praise, and not unaptly imitate the blessed\r\nchoirs of heaven: That we approach and examine the inaccessible seats of\r\nthe clouds, distant tracts of land, unfrequented paths of the sea; lofty\r\ntops of mountains, low bottoms of vallies, and deep gulphs of the ocean:\r\nThat we scale the ethereal towers; freely range through the celestial\r\nfields; measure the magnitudes and determine the interstices of the\r\nstars; prescribe inviolable laws to the heavens themselves, and contain\r\nthe wandering circuit of the stars within strict bounds: Lastly, that we\r\ncomprehend the huge fabric of the universe; admire and contemplate the\r\nwonderful beauty of the divine workmanship, and so learn the incredible\r\nforce and sagacity of our own minds by certain experiments, as to\r\nacknowledge the blessings of heaven with a pious affection.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  This very eminent mathematician, as well as learned and pious divine,\r\n  died in the year 1677, aged only forty-seven years. See the life of\r\n  this extraordinary man, written in 1683, by the learned Abraham Hill;\r\n  prefixed to the first volume of the doctor’s theological works; a\r\n  fifth edition of which, in three folio volumes, was published by\r\n  archbishop Tillotson, in 1741. He also wrote and published many\r\n  geometrical and mathematical works, all in Latin.\r\n\r\n  “The name of Dr. Barrow,” says Mr. Granger, one of his biographers,\r\n  “will ever be illustrious, for a strength of mind and a compass of\r\n  knowledge that did honour to his country. He was unrivalled in\r\n  mathematical learning, and especially in the sublime geometry, in\r\n  which he was excelled only by one man; and that man was his pupil, the\r\n  great Sir Isaac Newton. The same genius that seemed to be born only to\r\n  bring hidden things to light, to rise to the heights or descend to the\r\n  depths of science, would sometimes amuse itself in the flowery paths\r\n  of poetry, and he composed verses both in Greek and Latin.”\r\n\r\n  This “prodigy of learning,” as he is called by Mr. Granger, was\r\n  interred in Westminster Abbey, where a monument, adorned with his\r\n  bust, is erected to his memory.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe honours that have been rendered to celebrated men in almost every\r\nage of the world, and by all nations concerning which we have any\r\nhistorical memorials, are noticed by numberless writers, both ancient\r\nand modern. The cultivation of astronomical science had, doubtless, its\r\norigin in the remotest ages of antiquity,[48] through the Chaldeans,[49]\r\nthe Egyptians, the Phœnicians and Greeks, the Arabs, and the Chinese.\r\nBut the Indians of the western hemisphere appear to have had little\r\nknowledge of astronomy, at the time of Columbus’s discovery, yet they\r\nwere not inattentive to its objects: for Acosta tells us, that the\r\nPeruvians observed the equinoxes, by means of columns erected before the\r\ntemple of the sun at Cusco, and by a circle traced around it. Condamine\r\nlikewise relates, that the Indians on the river of the Amazons gave to\r\nthe Hyades, as we do, the name of the Bull’s-head; and Father Lasitau\r\nsays, that the Iroquois called the same stars the Bear, to which we give\r\nthat name; and designated the Polar star by the appellation of the\r\nimmoveable star. Captain Cook informs us, that the inhabitants of Taiti,\r\nin like manner, distinguish the different stars; and know in what part\r\nof the heavens they will appear, for each month in the year; their year\r\nconsisting of thirteen lunar months, each being twenty-nine days.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Flavius Josephus informs us, (in his _Jewish Antiquities_, b. i. chap.\r\n  7. 8.) that the sons of Seth employed themselves in astronomical\r\n  contemplations. According to the same historian, Abraham inferred the\r\n  unity and power of God, from the orderly course of things both at sea\r\n  and land, in their times and seasons, and from his observations upon\r\n  the motions and influences of the sun, moon and stars. He further\r\n  relates, that this patriarch delivered lectures on geometry and\r\n  arithmetic to the Egyptians, of which they understood nothing, until\r\n  Abraham introduced those sciences from Chaldea into Egypt, from whence\r\n  they passed into Greece: and, according to Eupolemus and Artapan, he\r\n  instructed the Phœnicians, as well as the Egyptians, in astronomy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  We are informed by some ancient writers, that when Babylon was taken,\r\n  Calisthenes, one of Aristotle’s scholars, carried from thence, by the\r\n  desire of his master, celestial observations made by the Chaldeans,\r\n  nearly two thousand years old; which carried them back to about the\r\n  time of the dispersion of mankind by the confusion of tongues: and\r\n  those observations are supposed to have been made in the famous temple\r\n  of Belus, at Babylon. But these accounts are not to be depended on:\r\n  because Hipparchus and Ptolemy could find no traces of any\r\n  observations made at Babylon before the time of Nabonassar, who began\r\n  his reign 747 years before the birth of Christ; and various writers,\r\n  among the ancients, agree in referring the earliest Babylonian\r\n  observations to about the same period. In all probability, the\r\n  Chaldean observations were then little more than matters of curiosity;\r\n  for, even in the three or four centuries immediately preceding the\r\n  Christian era, the celestial observations which were made by the\r\n  Greeks were, for the most part, far from being of any importance, in\r\n  relation to astronomical science.\r\n\r\n  Indeed, the knowledge of astronomy at much later periods than those in\r\n  which the most celebrated philosophers of Greece flourished, must have\r\n  been very limited and erroneous, on account of the defectiveness of\r\n  their instruments. And, added to the great disadvantages arising from\r\n  this cause, the ancients laboured under the want of a knowledge of the\r\n  telescope and the clock; and also maintained a false notion of the\r\n  system of the world; which was almost universally adhered to, until\r\n  the revival and improvement of the Pythagorean system by Copernicus,\r\n  who died in 1543. Within the last two hundred years, but,\r\n  particularly, since the laws of nature have been made manifest by the\r\n  labours and discoveries of the immortal NEWTON, the science of\r\n  astronomy has made astonishing advances towards perfection.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAstronomy has been patronised by many great princes and sovereign\r\nstates. Lalande observes, that, about the year 1230, the Emperor\r\nFrederick II.[50] prepared the way for the renewal of the sciences among\r\nthe moderns, and professed himself to be their protector. His reign,\r\naccording to the great French astronomer just mentioned, forms the first\r\nepocha of the revival of astronomy in Europe.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  This sovereign re-established the university of Naples, founded that\r\n  of Vienna in Austria, in the year 1237, and imparted new vigour to the\r\n  schools of Bologna and Salerno. He caused many ancient works in\r\n  medicine and philosophy to be translated from the Arabian tongue;\r\n  particularly, the _Almagest_ of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n  Cotemporary with the Emperor Frederick II. was Alphonso X. King of\r\n  Castile, surnamed _the Wise_. This prince was the first who manifested\r\n  a desire of correcting the _Tables of Ptolemy_. In the year 1240, even\r\n  during the life of his father, he drew to Toledo the most experienced\r\n  astronomers of his time, Christians, Moors, or Jews; by whose labours\r\n  he at length obtained the _Alphonsine Tables_, in 1252 (the first year\r\n  of his reign:) which were first printed at Venice, in 1483. He died in\r\n  the year 1284.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCoeval with that sovereign, was Johannes de Sacro-Bosco,[51] a famous\r\nEnglish ecclesiastic, who was the first astronomical writer that\r\nacquired celebrity in the thirteenth century. Very nearly about the same\r\ntime, appeared also that prodigy of genius and learning, Friar\r\nBacon:[52] and from that period, down to our own day, there has been a\r\nsuccession of illustrious philosophers: whose names have justly been\r\nrenowned, for the benefits they have conferred on mankind; names which\r\nreflect honour on the countries to which they respectively belong. Many\r\nof those benefactors of the world were honoured with marks of high\r\ndistinction, by their sovereigns and cotemporaries; and their fame will\r\ndescend to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  His name was _John Holywood_; deduced, according to a practice\r\n  prevalent in his time, from the place of his nativity, which was\r\n  Halifax, a town in the west-riding of Yorkshire, in England, where he\r\n  was born in the year 1204. It was formerly named _Holy-wood_; and was,\r\n  probably, so called in _Sacro-Bosco’s_ day: but the more ancient name\r\n  of that place was Horton, or _Hair_-town; and Halifax signifies\r\n  _Holy-hair_.—This great man was the inventor of the sphere; and wrote\r\n  a work, entitled _De Sphærâ_, which was very celebrated. He died at\r\n  Paris, in 1256.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  He died in 1294, at the age of eighty years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn recording these Memoirs of the Life of an American Philosopher, whose\r\nname adds dignity to the country that gave him birth, it is the design\r\nof the author to represent him as he truly was; and in doing so, he\r\nfeels a conscious satisfaction, that his pen is employed in delineating\r\nthe character of a man, who was rendered singularly eminent by his\r\ngenius, his virtues and his public services. Deeply impressed with the\r\nmagnitude and importance, as well as delicacy of the subject, the writer\r\nhas not undertaken the task without some hesitation. He is sensible of\r\nthe difficulties attending it, and conscious of his inability to do\r\njustice to its merits. Arduous, however, as the undertaking is, and\r\nsince no abler pen has hitherto attempted any thing more, on this\r\nsubject, than to eulogize[53] some of the prominent virtues and talents\r\nof our philosopher, his present biographer will endeavour, by the\r\nfidelity with which he shall portray the character of that truly\r\nestimable man, to atone for the imperfections of the work in other\r\nrespects. Possessing, as he does, some peculiar advantages, in relation\r\nto the materials necessary for this undertaking, he flatters himself it\r\nwill be found, that he has been enabled thereby to exhibit to his\r\ncountrymen, and the world generally, a portrait, which, in its more\r\nimportant features, may prove deserving of some share of public regard.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Dr. RUSH’S _Eulogium_, “intended to perpetuate the memory of DAVID\r\n  RITTENHOUSE,” &c. was delivered before the American Philosophical\r\n  Society in Philadelphia, (a great many public characters, and a\r\n  numerous concourse of private citizens, also attending,) on the 17th\r\n  of December 1796. It was pronounced in pursuance of an appointment\r\n  made by the society, in these words, viz:\r\n\r\n  “At a meeting convened by special order, on the 1st of July, 1796, the\r\n  following motion was made, and unanimously adopted; viz. That this\r\n  Society, deeply affected by the death of their late worthy President,\r\n  do resolve, That an EULOGIUM, commemorative of his distinguished\r\n  talents and services, be publicly pronounced before the Society, by\r\n  one of its members.”—Dr. Rush’s appointment was made at the next\r\n  meeting of the society.\r\n\r\n  The following resolutions passed by them, after the delivery of the\r\n  oration, will evince the high sense they entertained of the merit of\r\n  this performance; viz.\r\n\r\n  “_Philosophical Hall, Dec. 17, 1796.—In Meeting of the American\r\n  Philosophical Society_,\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, unanimously, That the thanks of this society be presented\r\n  to Dr. Benjamin Rush, for the eloquent, learned, comprehensive, and\r\n  just Eulogium, which he has this day pronounced, upon the character of\r\n  our late respected President, Dr. David Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, unanimously, That Dr. Rush be requested to furnish the\r\n  society with a copy of the Eulogium, to be published under their\r\n  direction.\r\n\r\n  “An extract from the minutes:—SAMUEL MAGAW, ROBERT PATTERSON, W.\r\n  BARTON, JOHN BLEAKLEY, Secretaries.”\r\n\r\n  It may not be thought superfluous, to add, that Dr. Rush well knew Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse. A personal friendship of an early date subsisted between\r\n  them: it probably originated when the latter established his residence\r\n  in Philadelphia, about six and twenty years before his death. In the\r\n  summer of 1772, Mr. Rittenhouse (in a letter to the Rev. Mr. Barton)\r\n  expressed his friendly estimation of the doctor in these few\r\n  words—“The esteem I have for Dr. Rush is such, that his friendship for\r\n  Mr. —— would, alone, give me a very good opinion of that gentleman.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSir William Forbes, in the introduction to his interesting Account of\r\nthe Life and Writings of the late Dr. Beattie, reminds his readers, that\r\n“Mr. Mason prefaces his excellent and entertaining Memoirs of the Life\r\nand Writings of Gray, with an observation more remarkable for its truth\r\nthan novelty;” that “the Lives of men of letters seldom abound with\r\nincidents.”—“A reader of sense and taste, therefore,” continues Mr.\r\nMason, “never expects to find, in the Memoirs of a Philosopher or Poet,\r\nthe same species of entertainment or information, which he would receive\r\nfrom those of a Statesman or General. He expects, however, to be\r\ninformed or entertained. Nor will he be disappointed, did the writer\r\ntake care to dwell principally on such topics as characterize the man,\r\nand distinguish that peculiar part which he acted in the varied drama of\r\nsociety.”\r\n\r\nYet these observations of Mr. Gray’s biographer, though pretty generally\r\ncorrect, admit of some qualification and many exceptions, depending on a\r\nvariety of circumstances. It is true, that a mere narrative of the life\r\nof a “philosopher,” as well as of a “poet,” considered only as such, and\r\nabstractedly, must be expected to be devoid of much “incident” that can\r\ninterest the generality of readers. But, both philosophers and poets\r\nhave, in some instances, been also statesmen; sometimes, even generals:\r\nboth have, not unfrequently, distinguished themselves as patriots, and\r\nbenefactors of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn writing the life of our philosopher, the plan of a dry recital of\r\nonly such circumstances and occurrences as have an immediate relation to\r\nthe individual, has not been pursued. Biographical Memoirs, it is\r\nconceived, do not confine a writer to limits so narrow, but permit him\r\nto take a much greater latitude. It is even allowable, in works of this\r\nkind, to introduce historical facts, memorable events, proceedings of\r\npublic bodies, notices of eminent men, evidences of the progress and\r\nstate of literature, science and the arts, and the actual condition of\r\ncivil society, in the scene that is contemplated; together with\r\noccasional reflections on those and similar subjects. Some of these\r\nobjects may not seem, perhaps, to be necessarily or very intimately\r\nconnected with the principal design, the life of the person treated of:\r\nbut such of them as should, at first view, appear to have the most\r\nremote relation to that object, may be afterwards discovered to be both\r\nuseful and interesting in a discussion of this nature; while others\r\nserve to elucidate the main scope of the work. A latitude of this\r\ndescription, in the compilation of memoirs, seems to be quite consistent\r\nwith the genius and spirit of works of that nature; and the modern\r\npractice of memoir-writers has been conformable to this view of the\r\nsubject.[54]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  “Biography, or the writing of Lives,” says Dr. Hugh Blair, “is a very\r\n  useful kind of composition; less formal and stately than history; but\r\n  to the bulk of readers, perhaps, no less instructive; as it affords\r\n  them the opportunity of seeing the characters and tempers, the virtues\r\n  and failings of eminent men, fully displayed; and admits them into a\r\n  more thorough and intimate acquaintance with such persons, than\r\n  history generally allows. For, a writer of lives may descend, with\r\n  propriety, to minute circumstances and familiar incidents. It is\r\n  expected of him, that he is to give the private, as well as public\r\n  life, of the person whose actions he records; nay, it is from private\r\n  life, from familiar, domestic, and seemingly trivial occurrences, we\r\n  often receive most light into the real character.”—_Lectures on\r\n  Rhetoric and Belles Lettres_, sect. 36. In addition to so respectable\r\n  an opinion as that of Professor Blair, respecting the utility and\r\n  characteristic features of biographical works, the writer of these\r\n  memoirs hopes he will be excused for giving the sentiments on the same\r\n  subject, contained in the following extracts from Dr. Maty’s _Memoirs\r\n  of the Life of Lord Chesterfield_, “tending to illustrate the civil,\r\n  literary, and political history of his own time.”\r\n\r\n  “Besides the great utility which general history derives from private\r\n  authorities, other advantages no less important,” says this learned\r\n  and ingenious biographer, “may be obtained from them. It is from\r\n  observing individuals, that we may be enabled to draw the outlines of\r\n  that extraordinary, complicated being, man. The characteristics of any\r\n  country or age must be deduced from the separate characters of\r\n  persons, who, however distinguishable in many respects, still preserve\r\n  a family-likeness. From the life of almost any one individual, but\r\n  chiefly from the lives of such eminent men as seemed destined to\r\n  enlighten or to adorn society, instructions may be drawn, suitable to\r\n  every capacity, rank, age or station. Young men, aspiring to honours,\r\n  cannot be too assiduous in tracing the means by which they were\r\n  obtained: by observing with what difficulty they were preserved, they\r\n  will be apprized of their real value, estimate the risks of the\r\n  purchase, and discover frequent disappointment in the possession.”\r\n\r\n  “It is from the number and variety of private memoirs, and the\r\n  collision of opposite testimonies, that the judicious reader is\r\n  enabled to strike out light, and find his way through that darkness\r\n  and confusion in which he is at first involved.”\r\n\r\n  “Who does not wish that Cæsar had lived to finish his Commentaries;\r\n  and that Pompey’s sons, instead of fighting their father’s cause, had\r\n  employed themselves in writing his life?—What a valuable legacy would\r\n  Cicero have left us, if, instead of his philosophical works, he had\r\n  written the memoirs of his own times! Or how much would Tyro, to whom\r\n  posterity is so much indebted for the preservation of his master’s\r\n  letters, have encreased that obligation, if, from his own knowledge,\r\n  he had connected and explained them! The life of Agricola, by his\r\n  son-in-law Tacitus, is undoubtedly one of the most precious monuments\r\n  of antiquity.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe writer of the present work has therefore ventured, with all due\r\ndeference to the public opinion, to pursue the course here described.\r\nAnd in doing this, he presumes that the comprehensive range he has\r\nallowed himself has enabled him to render his memoirs, even of a\r\n“philosopher,” not altogether barren of incidents, nor destitute, he\r\ntrusts, either of pleasing information or useful instruction.\r\n\r\n                ========================================\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The reader is requested to substitute (with his _pen_) the word\r\n_Earth_, in the place of “_Sun_,” in the sixth line of the note numbered\r\n(18), page xxxii. of the foregoing Introduction: the error in the print\r\nis an essential one; and passed unobserved, until it was too late to\r\ncorrect it in the press. At the same time the reader will be pleased to\r\ninsert the word _security_, in the place of “_scarcity_,” in the ninth\r\nline from the top of page xlii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MEMOIRS\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n                       LIFE OF DAVID RITTENHOUSE;\r\n                              ANTERIOR TO\r\n                    HIS SETTLEMENT IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n                ========================================\r\n\r\nThe paternal ancestors of DAVID RITTENHOUSE were early and long seated\r\nat Arnheim, a fortified city on the Rhine, and capital of the district\r\nof Velewe or Veluive, sometimes called the Velau, in the Batavian\r\nprovince of Guelderland;[55] where, it is said, they conducted\r\nmanufactories of paper,[56] during the course of some generations. The\r\northography of the name was formerly Rittinghuysen, as the writer of\r\nthese memoirs was informed by an European member of this family.[57] But\r\nit is net improbable, that, in more strict conformity to the idiom of\r\nits Saxo-Germanic original, the name was spelt Ritterhuysen[58]—or,\r\nperhaps, Ritterhausen; which signifies, in our language, _Knights’\r\nHouses_: a conjecture that seems to be somewhat corroborated by the\r\nchivalrous emblems alluding to this name, belonging to the family, and\r\nwhich have been already noticed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  The duchy of Guelderland formerly belonged to the Spanish monarchy;\r\n  but by the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, part of it was ceded to Austria,\r\n  part to Prussia, and guaranteed to them by the treaty of Baden, in\r\n  1714: that part which became subject to Prussia was, in exchange for\r\n  the principality of Orange, ceded to France. By the barrier-treaty, in\r\n  1715, the states general of the United Provinces likewise obtained a\r\n  part of it. But the Upper and Lower Guelderland have no connexion with\r\n  each other: Lower Guelderland is (or was, until very lately) one of\r\n  the Seven United Provinces: it is the largest of them all, and the\r\n  first in rank. Arnheim, which is the capital of the whole province, is\r\n  a large, populous, and handsome town: it was formerly the residence of\r\n  the dukes of Guelderland, and the states of the province held their\r\n  meetings there.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  The writer of these memoirs having been in Holland in the summer of\r\n  the year 1778, adverted, while in Amsterdam, to the circumstance of\r\n  the Rittenhouses, of Pennsylvania, having come into America from some\r\n  part of the United Provinces; and his curiosity being excited, by his\r\n  consanguineous connexion with that family, to obtain some information\r\n  concerning them, the following was the result of his enquiries. He\r\n  found a Mr. _Adrian Rittinghuysen_, (for so he himself wrote his\r\n  name,) residing in that city. This venerable man, who was then\r\n  eighty-five years of age, appeared to be at least independent in his\r\n  condition; and had, probably, retired from business, the part of the\r\n  city in which he resided (the Egelantier’s Gracht, or Canal,) not\r\n  exhibiting the appearance of a street of trade.\r\n\r\n  The information derived from this respectable old man, was, that his\r\n  forefathers had long been established at Arnheim; that his father,\r\n  Nicholas, was a paper-manufacturer in that city, as others of the\r\n  family had been; and that his father’s brother, William, went with his\r\n  family to North America, where he some time afterward, as he had\r\n  understood, established the paper-mills near Germantown. He further\r\n  stated, that he had only one child, a daughter, who was married, and\r\n  resided at the Hague; and that he was, himself, as he believed, the\r\n  last of his family-name, remaining in the United Provinces.\r\n\r\n  Although plain in his dress and manners, and in the general appearance\r\n  of his household, this person seemed to be pleased in shewing the\r\n  writer a family-seal, on which was engraved a coat of arms. The\r\n  armorial device represented a castellated house, or chateau; on the\r\n  left side of which was a horse, standing on his hind feet and rearing\r\n  up, with his fore feet resting against the wall of the house: and this\r\n  house very much resembled the chateau in the armorial bearing of the\r\n  Spanish family “_de Fuentes, señores del Castillio_,” as represented\r\n  in Dubuisson’s French Collection of Arms: The seal having been much\r\n  worn, the lines, &c. describing the several tinctures of the bearing,\r\n  could not be discerned; and, therefore, it cannot be properly\r\n  blazoned. At the same time, the old gentleman did not omit to mention,\r\n  that his mother was a _De Ruyter_; and that her arms were, a mounted\r\n  chevalier armed cap-à-piè.\r\n\r\n  These facts, relative to the origin of the American Rittenhouses, did\r\n  not appear to the writer to be unworthy of notice. They are correctly\r\n  stated, being taken from a memorandum made by him, immediately after\r\n  his interview with Adrian Rittinghuysen.\r\n\r\n  The introduction of this slight sketch of the occupation and condition\r\n  of some of the European ancestors of our Philosopher, into his Life,\r\n  may be the more readily excused, since the great Newton himself was\r\n  not inattentive to such objects. There is, indeed, implanted by nature\r\n  in the human mind, a strong desire to become acquainted with the\r\n  family-history of our forefathers. Hence, Sir Isaac Newton left, in\r\n  his own hand-writing, a genealogical account or pedigree of his\r\n  family; with directions, subjoined thereto, that the registers of\r\n  certain parishes should be searched, from the beginning to the year\r\n  1650; and he adds—“Let the extracts be taken, by copying out of the\r\n  registers whatever may be met with, about the family of the Newtons,\r\n  in words at length, without omitting any of the words.” This\r\n  investigation and enquiry of Sir Isaac, was made in the sixty-third\r\n  year of his age; and he himself caused the result to be entered in the\r\n  books of the herald’s office.\r\n\r\n  Such, also, was the curiosity of Dr. Benjamin Franklin. While the\r\n  Doctor was in England, he undertook a journey to Eaton, in\r\n  Northamptonshire, (a village situated between Wellingborough and\r\n  Northampton,) the residence of his forefathers, for the purpose of\r\n  obtaining information, as he tells us himself, concerning his\r\n  family.—“To be acquainted with the particulars of my parentage and\r\n  life, many of which are unknown to you,” (said Dr. Franklin in his\r\n  _Life_, which he addressed to his son,) “I flatter myself, will afford\r\n  the same pleasure to you as to me—I shall, relate them upon paper.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  See the preceding note.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Conradus Rittershusius was a learned civilian of Germany. He was born\r\n  at Brunswick in the year 1560, and died at Altorf in Switzerland, in\r\n  1613. Two of his sons, George and Nicholas, also distinguished\r\n  themselves in the republic of letters. The writer of the present\r\n  memoirs is too little acquainted with the genealogies of either German\r\n  or Dutch families, to pretend to claim any consanguinity between this\r\n  C. Rittershuysen (or, as latinized, Rittershusius,) and our\r\n  Rittenhouses. But the name appears to have been, originally, the same;\r\n  and the ancestors of both, it may be presumed, were of the same\r\n  country: In giving a latin termination to the name, the _y_ is\r\n  omitted, not being a Roman letter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted, that the first of the Rittenhouses who migrated to\r\nAmerica, was named William; and that he went from Guelderland to the\r\n(now) state of New-York, while it was yet a Dutch colony. This William\r\nwas also said to have left at Arnheim a brother, Nicholas, who continued\r\nto carry on the paper-making business in that city.[59] But, in a\r\ngenealogical account of the family in the possession of the Memorialist,\r\nGarrett (or Gerard) and Nicholas Rittenhouse are stated to have arrived\r\nat New-York, from Holland, so late as the year 1690: it likewise states,\r\nthat Nicholas there married Wilhelmina Dewees, a sister of William\r\nDewees, who came thither about the same time; and that, soon afterwards,\r\nthey all removed to the neighbourhood of Germantown in Pennsylvania;\r\nwhere Nicholas established the first paper-mill ever erected in\r\nAmerica.[60] It is believed, however, that Garrett and Nicholas\r\nRittenhouse were sons of William; who is supposed to have arrived in\r\nsome part of the original territories of New-York, prior to the year\r\n1674;[61] that the Nicholas left in Arnheim, was his brother; and that\r\nhis sons Garrett and Nicholas, who are stated to have been the first of\r\nthe family that settled in New-York, in 1690 (from whence they removed,\r\n“soon afterwards,” into Pennsylvania,) did, in fact, transfer themselves\r\ninto this latter province, in that year.—Garrett left children; some of\r\nwhose descendants are resident in Pennsylvania, and others in\r\nNew-Jersey.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  The Dutch were early and long distinguished for the superior quality\r\n  of the paper manufactured in their country. It excelled, in its\r\n  whiteness and the closeness of its texture, as well as its goodness in\r\n  other respects, the paper made elsewhere; and it was an article of\r\n  great importance to the republic, both for the internal consumption\r\n  and for exportation, until the Hollanders were rivalled in this\r\n  manufacture by the perfection to which it was afterwards brought in\r\n  other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n  Paper, made from linen rags (for that made from cotton, silk, and some\r\n  other substances, was of a much elder date,) is said to have been\r\n  originally introduced into Germany from Valencia and Catalonia, in\r\n  Spain, as early as the year 1312, and to have appeared in England\r\n  eight or ten years afterwards. But the first paper-mill in Great\r\n  Britain was erected at Dartford in Kent, by Mr. Speelman, a German,\r\n  jeweller to queen Elizabeth, in the year 1558: and it was not until\r\n  more than a century after, that any other paper than of an inferior\r\n  quality was manufactured in England. Little besides brown paper was\r\n  made there, prior to the revolution in 1688: yet, soon after that\r\n  period, the English were enabled to supply themselves with much the\r\n  greater part of the various kinds of paper used in their country, from\r\n  their own mills; and the perfection to which the manufacture of this\r\n  important article has since been carried, not only in England, but in\r\n  France, Italy and Germany, has greatly diminished the consumption of\r\n  Dutch paper.\r\n\r\n  It is a fact worthy of notice, that the establishment of paper-mills\r\n  in Pennsylvania, by the Rittenhouses, was nearly co-eval with the\r\n  general introduction of the manufactory of white paper in the mother\r\n  country. This appears from the following circumstance:—There is now\r\n  before the writer of these memoirs a paper in the hand-writing of the\r\n  celebrated William Penn, and subscribed with his name, certifying that\r\n  “William Rittinghousen and Claus” (Nicholas) “his son,” then “part\r\n  owners of the paper-mill near Germantown,” had recently sustained a\r\n  very great loss by a violent and sudden flood, which carried away the\r\n  said mill, with a considerable quantity of paper, materials and tools,\r\n  with other things therein, whereby they were reduced to great\r\n  distress; and, therefore, recommending to such persons as should be\r\n  disposed to lend them aid, to give the sufferers “relief and\r\n  encouragement, in their needful and commendable employment,” as they\r\n  were “desirous to set up the paper-mill again.”—This certificate is\r\n  without date: but Mr. Penn was twice in Pennsylvania. He first arrived\r\n  in the year 1682, and returned to England in 1684; his second arrival\r\n  was in 1699, and he finally left the province in 1701. It was probably\r\n  during the latter period of his residence in his proprietary-dominion,\r\n  though, perhaps, in the first, that the Germantown paper-mills were\r\n  destroyed.\r\n\r\n  The William Rittinghousen (so Mr. Penn writes the name) here\r\n  mentioned, is supposed to be the same named in the text, and to have\r\n  been the great-grandfather of our astronomer. In Mr. Penn’s\r\n  certificate he is called an old man, and is stated to have then been\r\n  “decrepid.”\r\n\r\n  In order to shew the present importance of that article, as a\r\n  manufacture, in the United States, and which was first fabricated in\r\n  this country by the Rittenhouses, the reader is presented with the\r\n  following view of the quantity of paper, of various descriptions,\r\n  annually made at one hundred and eighty-five paper-mills, within the\r\n  United States; taken from the latest information furnished on this\r\n  subject.\r\n\r\n                                    Tons.

But\r\n  the Dutch having reduced the country in the years 1672 and 1673, it\r\n  was finally restored to the English by the peace of Westminster, on\r\n  the 9th of February, 1674. The Rittenhouses are supposed to have\r\n  seated themselves, before this latter period, in that part of the\r\n  colony afterwards called East-Jersey. Some of the name reside in the\r\n  state of New-Jersey, at this day; but it is not known that any of them\r\n  are inhabitants of the state of New-York. Those in New-Jersey, with\r\n  most of those of the name in Pennsylvania, are descendants of\r\n  Nicholas.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNicholas Rittenhouse, the grandfather of our Philosopher, died about the\r\nyear 1730; leaving three sons, William, Henry, and Matthias; and four\r\ndaughters, Psyche, Mary, Catharine, and Susanna. Of these daughters,\r\nPsyche intermarried with John Gorgas, from whom are descended the\r\nGorgas’s of Cresham and Cocolico; Mary, with John Johnson, the father of\r\nCasper, John, Nicholas, William, and Benjamin Johnson, some of whom are\r\nnow (or were lately) living, in the neighbourhood of Germantown;\r\nCatharine, with Jacob Engle, in the same vicinity; and Susanna, with\r\nHenry Heiley of Goshehoppen.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rittenhouse, the eldest brother of our Philosopher’s father,\r\ndied at the paper-mills, near Germantown. He left several children, one\r\nof whom did lately, and perhaps yet does, carry on those works.—Henry\r\nand Matthias removed to the townships of Worcester and Norriton, about\r\nthe year 1732 or 1733; where both lived to be upwards of seventy years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nThe old American stock of the Rittenhouses were Anabaptists,[62] and\r\npersons of very considerable note in that religious society. Probably,\r\ntherefore, they were induced to establish their residence in\r\nPennsylvania, towards the close of the seventeenth century, by the\r\ntolerating principles held forth by William Penn,[63] in respect to\r\nreligious[64] concerns; the justness of the tenure by which he became\r\nproprietor of the soil;[65] and the excellence of the political\r\nregulations established by that great legislator, for the civil\r\ngovernment of his newly-acquired domains.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  The Rittenhouses who first settled in America, are supposed to have\r\n  leaned towards the religious tenets of (if they did not belong to)\r\n  that peaceable branch of the Anabaptists, denominated Mennonites.\r\n  Simon Menno, the founder of this sect, was one of the first reformers:\r\n  he was born at a village called Witmarsum, in the Batavian province of\r\n  Friesland, in 1505; the same year in which John Knox was born, and\r\n  four years before the birth of Calvin.\r\n\r\n  Menno had been a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, and some have\r\n  endeavoured to stigmatize him, as one who was “a notorious\r\n  profligate.” This, however, may be attributed to his having left the\r\n  communion of the church of which he was originally a member: for, he\r\n  is represented to have been “a man of probity, of a meek and tractable\r\n  spirit, gentle in his manners, pliable and obsequious in his commerce\r\n  with persons of all ranks and characters, and extremely zealous in\r\n  promoting practical religion and virtue, which he recommended by his\r\n  example as well as by his precepts.” He was, moreover, a man of genius\r\n  and eloquence, and possessed a considerable share of learning. This\r\n  extraordinary man died in the duchy of Holstein, in the year 1561.\r\n\r\n  The fundamental principles of the followers of Menno are, in some\r\n  respects, similar to those of the people called Quakers: They use,\r\n  likewise, great plainness in their apparel, and adhere to some of the\r\n  practices of the primitive Christian church. But this peaceable sect\r\n  baptize adults, and celebrate the eucharist in a manner peculiar to\r\n  themselves.\r\n\r\n  Some of Menno’s disciples came into Pennsylvania from New-York, in the\r\n  year 1692. The principal congregation of this sect was established at\r\n  Germantown, soon after the Rittenhouses had settled themselves there;\r\n  and this may be considered as the mother of the sect, in America. The\r\n  Mennonites have since become a numerous body in Pennsylvania,\r\n  principally in the county of Lancaster; and this religious society\r\n  comprehends, among its members, many intelligent worthy men, and\r\n  valuable citizens.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  In the Preface to a printed copy of the celebrated Speech delivered in\r\n  the House of Assembly of Pennsylvania, on the 24th of May, 1764, by\r\n  the late John Dickinson, Esq. the Merits of the Founder of\r\n  Pennsylvania, as they were declared at various times, in the\r\n  proceedings of the Legislative Body of the colony, and in some other\r\n  public Documents, are thus summed up by the writer.\r\n\r\n                              “WILLIAM PENN,\r\n                    A Man of Principles truly humane;\r\n                             An Advocate for\r\n                          Religion and Liberty;\r\n                        Possessing a noble Spirit,\r\n                           That exerted itself\r\n                         For the Good of Mankind;\r\n                                   was\r\n                       The great and worthy Founder\r\n                                    of\r\n                              PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n                     To its Inhabitants, by Charter,\r\n                         He granted and confirmed\r\n                 Many singular Privileges and Immunities,\r\n                           Civil and Religious,\r\n                       Which he continually studied\r\n                     To preserve and defend for them;\r\n                             Nobly declaring,\r\n                  That they had not followed him so far,\r\n                         To lose a single tittle\r\n                          Of the Great Charter,\r\n                    To which all Englishmen were born.\r\n                           For these Services,\r\n                   Great have been the Acknowledgements\r\n                      Deservedly paid to his Merit;\r\n                              And his Memory\r\n                          Is dear to his People,\r\n                      Who have repeatedly confessed,\r\n                                  That,\r\n                        Next to Divine Providence,\r\n                Their Happiness, Prosperity, and Increase\r\n                                Are owing\r\n                To his wise Conduct and singular Goodness;\r\n                   Which deserve ever to be remembered\r\n                                   With\r\n                         Gratitude and Affection,\r\n                                    By\r\n                             PENNSYLVANIANS.”\r\n\r\n  For the materials of which the foregoing Eulogy is composed, its\r\n  author[63a] has referred his readers to the Minutes of Assembly, for\r\n  the years 1719 and 1725, to those from the year 1730 to 1740, both\r\n  inclusive, excepting only 1736, 1737 and 1739; also, for 1745, 1755\r\n  and 1756; to other proceedings of the assembly, in the years 1730 and\r\n  1738; and to their Address to Governor John Penn, in 1764.\r\n\r\n  A very respectable Memorial of another nature, in honour of the justly\r\n  celebrated Penn, decorates the edifice of a noble public institution\r\n  in the capital of his former domain; an institution devoted to the\r\n  purposes of charity, humanity and benevolence. It is a finely executed\r\n  metallic statue, in bronze, of that great man; representing him in his\r\n  appropriate attire, and holding in his right hand _The Charter of\r\n  Privileges_.[63b] The statue stands on an elegant pedestal of marble,\r\n  in an handsome area on the south front of the Pennsylvania Hospital:\r\n  and the four sides of the pedestal contain these modest inscriptions;\r\n  viz.\r\n\r\n                  “William Penn—Born, 1644—Died, 1718.”\r\n         (And underneath, the Family-Arms, with his Motto; viz.)\r\n                             “Mercy—Justice.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n          “Pennsylvania Granted by Charles II. to William Penn,\r\n                                  1681.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n  “The Proprietary arrived in 1682; made a just and amicable arrangement\r\n  with the Natives, for the purchase of their Lands; and went back to\r\n  England in 1684.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n  “Returned to Pennsylvania, 1699; and finally withdrew to his Paternal\r\n  Estate, 1701.”\r\n\r\n  The public in general, with the Pennsylvania Hospital more\r\n  particularly, are indebted for this Memorial of true Greatness, to the\r\n  munificence of a Grandson of the Founder of the extensive Dominion\r\n  that bears his name; John Penn, of Stoke-Poges in Buckinghamshire,\r\n  Esquire; by whom the statue was presented, in the year 1804.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63a:\r\n\r\n  In the continuation of the _Life of Dr. Franklin_, (written by the\r\n  late Dr. Stuber, of Philadelphia,) it is said that the Preface to Mr.\r\n  Dickinson’s Speech was drawn up by the late learned Provost Smith, and\r\n  that Dr. Franklin wrote the Preface to Mr. Galloway’s, in reply.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63b:\r\n\r\n  See Note 64\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  The Charter of Privileges, granted and solemnly confirmed to the\r\n  freemen of Pennsylvania and territories belonging to the province, by\r\n  the proprietary, on the 28th of October, 1701, was, after being\r\n  approved and agreed to by the legislative body of the province,\r\n  accepted by them the same day; in lieu of the Frame of Government\r\n  originally stipulated between Mr. Penn and the Planters, in the year\r\n  1683. The first article of this charter provided for a full enjoyment\r\n  of the Liberty of Conscience, by all persons who should acknowledge\r\n  “One Almighty God, the Creator, Upholder, and Ruler of the World.” It\r\n  also declared to be capable of holding any office or place, under the\r\n  government, all persons professing faith in “Jesus Christ, the Saviour\r\n  of the World,” and who should, when required, attest their allegiance,\r\n  &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Incorporated with that edition of the _Laws of Pennsylvania_, which\r\n  was published in the year 1810, “under the authority of the\r\n  legislature,” with Notes and References, by Charles Smith, Esq. is an\r\n  article that bears a respectful testimony to the justice and clemency\r\n  of the founder of that state: It is an important and very interesting\r\n  _Note_ to an act of assembly passed the 1st day of April, 1784,\r\n  (entitled, “An act for opening the Land-Office, for granting and\r\n  disposing of the unappropriated Lands within this State,”) containing\r\n  “a connected view of the land-titles of Pennsylvania from its first\r\n  settlement to the present time.” In this document the learned editor\r\n  speaks of the integrity and virtuous policy manifested by Penn, with\r\n  respect to his conduct towards the Indian natives of the country, to\r\n  which he had acquired the dominion under his sovereign, in these\r\n  terms.\r\n\r\n  “William Penn, although clothed with powers as full and comprehensive\r\n  as those possesed by the adventurers from Portugal and Spain, was\r\n  influenced by a purer morality and sounder policy. His religious\r\n  principles did not permit him to wrest the soil, by force, from the\r\n  people to whom God and nature gave it, nor to establish his title in\r\n  blood; but, under the shade of the lofty trees of the forest, his\r\n  right was fixed by treaties with the natives, and sanctified, as it\r\n  were, by incense smoking from the calumet of peace.”\r\n\r\n  The note from which this extract is made, (and which comprizes 156\r\n  large 8vo. pages, printed on a small type,) forms a valuable treatise,\r\n  historical as well as legal, of the territorial rights of the former\r\n  proprietaries, and of the land-titles deduced from them by the\r\n  citizens of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMatthias, the youngest son of Nicholas Rittenhouse, by Wilhelmina Dewees\r\nhis wife, was born at the paper-mills belonging to his family, near\r\nGermantown,[66] in the county of Philadelphia and about eight miles from\r\nthe capital of Pennsylvania, in the year 1703. Having abandoned the\r\noccupation of a paper-maker, when about twenty-nine years of age, and\r\ntwo years after his father’s death, he then commenced the business of a\r\nfarmer, on a piece of land he had purchased in the township of\r\nNorriton,[67] about twenty miles from the city of Philadelphia; his\r\nbrother Henry establishing himself in the same manner, in the adjoining\r\ntownship of Worcester. In October, 1727,—about three years prior to\r\nMatthias’s removal from the vicinity of Germantown,—he had become a\r\nmarried man. His wife was Elizabeth William (or Williams) who was born\r\nin 1704, and was daughter of Evan William, a native of Wales. Her\r\nfather, a farmer, dying while she was a child, she was placed under the\r\ncharge of an elderly English (or, more probably, Welsh) gentleman, in\r\nthe neighbourhood, of the name of Richard Jones; a relation of her\r\nfamily. That truly respectable woman possessed a cheerful temper, with a\r\nmind uncommonly vigorous and comprehensive: but her education was much\r\nneglected, as is too often the fate of orphan children. Yet, perhaps, no\r\ncensure ought justly to be imputable to Mr. Jones, in this case; because\r\nthere were very few schools of any kind, in country situations, at that\r\nearly day.[68]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  Germantown was settled in the year 1682. It was so called by its\r\n  founders, a small colony of Germans from the Palatinate, mostly from\r\n  the vicinity of the city of Worms, who are said to have been converted\r\n  while in their own country, to the principles of the people called\r\n  Quakers, by the preaching of William Ames, an Englishman. Germantown\r\n  is now a populous village, of considerable extent; and by reason of\r\n  its proximity to the capital, this place furnishes an agreeable\r\n  residence to many respectable families from thence. See also Note 62.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  This township derives its name (which it gave also to Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse’s patrimonial farm and his original observatory,) as does\r\n  likewise the neighbouring town of Norriston, the county-town of the\r\n  (now) county of Montgomery, from the respectable Pennsylvania family\r\n  of Norris; of which Isaac Norris, Esq. was eighteen times chosen\r\n  Speaker of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, during the term of\r\n  half a century from the time of his first election, in the year 1713.\r\n  Mr. Norris held many public offices in Pennsylvania with great\r\n  reputation and honour. He is represented as having been “an ornament\r\n  to his country;” and this gentleman, who died in the year 1735, then\r\n  held the Chief-Justiceship of the Province.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  In the year 1683, Enoch Flower undertook to teach English in the town\r\n  of Philadelphia. Six years afterwards, originated the Friends’ Public\r\n  School in the same town, then in its infancy; and in 1697, this school\r\n  was incorporated, on the petition of Samuel Carpenter, Edward Shippen,\r\n  Anthony Morris, James Fox, David Lloyd, William Southby, and John\r\n  Jones, in behalf of themselves and others. In the year 1708, this\r\n  corporation was enlarged and perpetuated by a new charter, under the\r\n  name of “The Overseers of the Public School, founded in Philadelphia,\r\n  at the request, cost, and charges of the people called Quakers.” It\r\n  was further extended in the year 1711; when the three first named\r\n  gentlemen, together with Griffith Owen, Thomas Story, Richard Hill,\r\n  Isaac Norris, Samuel Preston, Jonathan Dickinson, Nathan Stanbury,\r\n  Thomas Masters, Nicholas Waln, Caleb Pusey, Rowland Ellis and James\r\n  Logan, were appointed Overseers.\r\n\r\n  As this was the earliest considerable school established in\r\n  Pennsylvania, as well as the first institution of the kind, in the\r\n  province, the names of its promoters deserve to be held in\r\n  remembrance, among the Patrons of learning and useful knowledge in\r\n  this country.\r\n\r\n  From this view of the origin of schools in the capital of\r\n  Pennsylvania, it will be perceived, that the means of acquiring even\r\n  the rudiments of literary instruction must have been difficult of\r\n  access in country places, for some considerable time after the periods\r\n  just mentioned. This is one of the most serious grievances to which\r\n  the settlers in new and unimproved countries are subjected.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary natural understanding of this person, so very nearly\r\nrelated as she was to the subject of these memoirs, seemed to the writer\r\nto merit particular notice; and the more especially, for a reason which\r\nshall be hereafter mentioned.\r\n\r\nBy this wife, Matthias Rittenhouse had four sons and six daughters;[69]\r\nthree of whom died in their minority. The three eldest of the children\r\nwere born at the place of their father’s nativity; the others, at\r\nNorriton. Of the former number was DAVID, the eldest son, the subject of\r\nthese memoirs.—He was born on the 8th day of April, 1732.[70]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Margaret, who intermarried with Edward Morgan; Esther, with the Rev.\r\n  Thomas Barton; David, the subject of these Memoirs; Andrew, who died\r\n  in his minority; Anne, who intermarried with George Shoemaker;\r\n  Eleanor, who intermarried with Daniel Evans; Benjamin, yet living;\r\n  Jonathan, who died in his minority; and Mary and Elizabeth (twins,) of\r\n  whom the latter died in her minority, unmarried: Mary, who is living,\r\n  has been twice married, but without issue; her first husband was\r\n  Thomas Morgan. David had no sons; and two of his three brothers having\r\n  died young and unmarried, the only persons, descended from our\r\n  philosopher’s father, Matthias, who now bear the name of Rittenhouse,\r\n  are the surviving brother of David, namely, Benjamin, and his sons.\r\n  Benjamin has been twice married; first, to a daughter of General John\r\n  Bull; and, secondly, to a daughter of Colonel Francis Wade: By both\r\n  marriages he has male issue; and, as it is believed, two of the sons\r\n  by the first wife are married.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  “There is,” says a late ingenious writer,[70a] “a strong propensity in\r\n  the human mind to trace up our ancestry to as high and as remote a\r\n  source as possible.” “This principle of our nature,” he observes,\r\n  “although liable to great perversion; and frequently the source of\r\n  well-founded ridicule, may, if rightly directed, become the parent of\r\n  great actions. The origin and progress of individuals, of families,\r\n  and of nations, constitute Biography and History, two of the most\r\n  interesting departments of human knowledge.”\r\n\r\n  The pride of ancestry is, indeed, “liable to great perversion,” and is\r\n  too frequently “the source of well-founded ridicule:” yet the\r\n  experience and the history of mankind, in every age and country, have\r\n  shewn, that it is connected with and derived from principles of our\r\n  nature, which are not only laudable in themselves, but such as, if\r\n  “rightly directed” and properly applied, become eminently useful to\r\n  society.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70a:\r\n\r\n  See a “Discourse delivered before the New-York Historical Society, at\r\n  their anniversary meeting, December the 6th, 1811: By the Hon. De Witt\r\n  Clinton, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Society.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis son was an infant, when his family removed to Norriton and engaged\r\nin the business of farming; and his father appears, early, to have\r\ndesigned him for this most useful and very respectable employment.\r\nAccordingly, as soon as the boy arrived at a sufficient age to assist in\r\nconducting the affairs of the farm, he was occupied as an husbandman.\r\nThis kind of occupation seems to have commenced at a very early period\r\nof his life; for it is ascertained, that, about the fourteenth year of\r\nhis age, he was actually employed in ploughing his father’s fields.[71]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  It is not this occupation that, in itself, usually attaches to those\r\n  who follow it, the idea of clownishness: but it is the ignorance that,\r\n  unfortunately, too generally characterizes persons employed in it,\r\n  which, by an association of ideas, is apt to derogate from the\r\n  worthiness of the employment itself. If the profession of husbandry be\r\n  an honourable one, and every rational consideration renders it such,\r\n  then one of the most important operations in conducting the great\r\n  business of the agriculturist, cannot be destitute of dignity. To\r\n  follow the plough is not a servile labour: it is an employment worthy\r\n  of a freeman; and if the person, thus engaged, be a man of native\r\n  talents, aided by some improvement of mind, scarcely any occupation\r\n  can afford him greater scope for philosophic reflection.\r\n\r\n  While, therefore, the reader contemplates the celebrated Rittenhouse,\r\n  such as he was in his maturer years; and then takes a retrospective\r\n  view of the embryo-philosopher in the period of his youth, directing\r\n  the plough on his father’s freehold; let it be recollected, that the\r\n  sovereigns of a mighty empire, in the Eastern world, occasionally\r\n  guide this truly important machine with their own hands, in honour of\r\n  agriculture: let him recal to his mind, that, in the proudest days of\r\n  the Roman republic, consuls, dictators, senators, and generals, were\r\n  not unfrequently called forth from the actual occupancy of this\r\n  implement of husbandry, by the voice of their country; and, seizing\r\n  either the civil or the military helm of its government, with hands\r\n  indurated by the toils of the peaceful field, have by the wisdom of\r\n  their counsel, or by their valour, supported the tottering fabric of\r\n  the state and saved the commonwealth: let them remember, in fine,\r\n  that—\r\n\r\n              “In ancient times, the sacred plough employ’d\r\n              The kings and awful fathers of mankind;”[71a]\r\n\r\n  and that WASHINGTON, himself, the pride and boast of his age as well\r\n  as country, disdained not to engage himself, personally, in\r\n  agricultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71a:\r\n\r\n  Thomson’s Spring.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt that period of our future Philosopher’s life, early as it was, his\r\nuncultivated mind, naturally teeming with the most prolific germs of yet\r\nunexpanded science, began to unfold those buds of genius, which soon\r\nafter attained that wonderful luxuriance of growth by which the\r\nusefulness and splendour of his talents became eminently conspicuous.\r\nHis brother Benjamin relates,[72] that, while David was thus employed at\r\nthe plough, from the age of fourteen years and for some time after, he\r\n(this informant,) then a young boy, was frequently sent to call him to\r\nhis meals; at which times he repeatedly observed, that not only the\r\nfences at the head of many of the furrows, but even his plough and its\r\nhandles, were covered over with chalked numerical figures, &c.[73]—Hence\r\nit is evident, that the exuberance of a sublime native genius and of\r\nalmost unbounded intellectual powers, unaided by any artificial means of\r\nexcitement, were enabled, by dint of their own energy, to burst through\r\nthose restraints which the corporeal employments of his youth\r\nnecessarily imposed upon them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  This gentleman was commissioned by Governor Mifflin, in the year 1791,\r\n  to be one of the associate judges of the court of common pleas, in and\r\n  for the county of Montgomery: but his tenure of this office was\r\n  afterwards vacated, by his removal to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  “Astronomy,” says Mr. B. Rittenhouse, in the letter before referred\r\n  to, “appeared at a very early day to be his favourite study; but he\r\n  also applied himself industriously to the study of opticks, the\r\n  mechanical powers,” &c.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDuring that portion of his life in which this youthful philosopher\r\npursued the ordinary occupations of a husbandman, which continued until\r\nabout the eighteenth year of his age, as well as in his earlier youth,\r\nhe appeared to have inherited from healthful parents a sound\r\nconstitution, and to have enjoyed good health.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period, or rather about the seventeenth year of his age,\r\nthat he made a wooden clock, of very ingenious workmanship: and soon\r\nafter, he constructed one of the same materials that compose the common\r\nfour-and-twenty hour clock, and upon the same principles. But he had\r\nexhibited much earlier proofs of his mechanical genius, by making, when\r\nonly seven or eight years old, a complete water-mill in miniature.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse’s father was a very respectable man: he possessed a good\r\nunderstanding, united to a most benevolent heart and great simplicity of\r\nmanners. The writer long knew him; and, from his early acquaintance with\r\nthe character, the appearance, and the habits of this worthy sire of an\r\nillustrious son, he had long supposed him to have been inclined to the\r\nreligious principles of the society called Friends, although he had been\r\nbred a Baptist:—but a circumstance which shall be noticed hereafter,\r\nwill evince the liberality of this good man’s opinions, in the\r\nall-important concern of religion. Yet, with truly estimable qualities,\r\nboth of the head and heart, old Mr. Rittenhouse had no claims to what is\r\ntermed genius; and therefore did not, probably, duly appreciate the\r\nearly specimens of that talent, which appeared so conspicuous in his son\r\nDavid. Hence, he was for some time opposed to the young man’s earnest\r\ndesire to renounce agricultural employments; for the purpose of devoting\r\nhimself, altogether, to philosophical pursuits, in connexion with some\r\nsuch mechanical profession as might best comport with useful objects of\r\nnatural philosophy, and be most likely, at the same time, to afford him\r\nthe means of a comfortable subsistence. At length, however, the father\r\nyielded his own inclinations, in order to gratify what was manifestly\r\nthe irresistible impulse of his son’s genius: he supplied him with money\r\nto purchase, in Philadelphia, such tools as were more immediately\r\nnecessary for commencing the clock-making business, which the son then\r\nadopted as his profession.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, young Mr. Rittenhouse erected on the side of a\r\npublic road, and on his father’s land in the township of Norriton, a\r\nsmall but commodious work-shop; and, after having made many implements\r\nof the trade with his own hands, to supply the deficiency of many such\r\nas were wanting in his purchased stock, he set out in good earnest as a\r\nclock and mathematical instrument maker.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of eighteen or nineteen to twenty-five, Mr. Rittenhouse\r\napplied himself unremittingly, both to his trade and his studies.\r\nEmployed throughout the day in his attention to the former, he devoted\r\nmuch of his nights to the latter. Indeed he deprived himself of the\r\nnecessary hours of rest; for it was his almost invariable practice to\r\nsit up, at his books, until midnight, sometimes much later.\r\n\r\nIt was in this interval and by these means, that our young philosopher\r\nimpaired his constitution, and contracted a pain in his breast; or\r\nrather, as he himself described that malady to the writer, “a constant\r\nheat in the pit of the stomach, affecting a space not exceeding the size\r\nof half a guinea, attended at times with much pain;” a sensation from\r\nwhich he was never exempt, during the remainder of his life. About this\r\ntime, he retired from all business, and passed several weeks at the\r\nYellow Springs, distant but a few miles from his place of residence. He\r\nthere bathed and drank the waters; and from the use of this chalybeate,\r\nhe appeared to have derived some benefit to his general health, though\r\nit afforded little alleviation of the pain in his breast.\r\n\r\nA due regard to the sacredness of historic truth demands, that some\r\ncircumstances which occurred while Mr. Rittenhouse was yet a youth, and\r\n_one_ which it is believed had a very considerable influence on his\r\nsubsequent pursuits and reputation, should now be made known. Because\r\nthe writer of these memoirs conceives he ought not to be restrained, by\r\nmotives which would appear to him to arise from a mistaken delicacy,\r\nfrom introducing into his work such notices of his own father, long\r\nsince deceased, as do justice to his memory; while they also serve to\r\nelucidate the biographical history of Mr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1751, when David Rittenhouse was about nineteen years of\r\nage, THOMAS BARTON, who was two years elder than David, opened a school\r\nin the neighbourhood of Mr. Matthias Rittenhouse. It was while Mr.\r\nBarton continued in that place, supposed to have been about a year and a\r\nhalf, that he became acquainted with the Rittenhouse Family; an\r\nacquaintance which soon ripened into a warm friendship for young Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, and a more tender attachment to his sister, Esther.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards (in 1753), the personal attractions and fine\r\nunderstanding of the sister rendered her the wife of Mr. Barton; who,\r\nfor some time before, had officiated as one of the tutors in the then\r\nrecently-established Academy, afterwards College, of Philadelphia; now\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania. In this station, he continued until the\r\nautumn of 1754; when he embarked for England, for the purpose of\r\nreceiving episcopal ordination in the church, and returned to\r\nPennsylvania in the early part of the following year.\r\n\r\nThe very intimate connexion thus formed between Mr. Barton and a sister\r\nof Mr. Rittenhouse (who was two years elder than this brother),\r\nstrengthened the bands of friendship which had so early united these\r\nyoung men: a friendship affectionate and sincere, and one which never\r\nceased until Mr. Barton’s death, nearly thirty years afterwards;\r\nnotwithstanding some difference of political opinions had arisen between\r\nthese brothers-in-law, in the latter part of that period, in consequence\r\nof the declaration of the American independence.\r\n\r\nMr. Barton was a native of Ireland, descended from an English family; of\r\nwhich, either two or three brothers settled in that kingdom, during the\r\ndisastrous times in the interregnum of Charles I. Having obtained very\r\nconsiderable grants of land in Ireland, this family possessed ample\r\nestates in their then adopted country. Hence, flattering prospects of an\r\nestablishment there, in respect to fortune, were held out to their\r\ndescendants. Through one of those untoward circumstances, however, by\r\nmeans of which the most unexpected revolutions in the affairs of\r\nfamilies and individuals have been sometimes produced, the expectations\r\nof an independent patrimony which our Mr. Barton’s father had\r\nentertained, were speedily dissipated. Nevertheless, this gentleman, who\r\nwas the eldest son of his family, was instructed in the rudiments of a\r\nclassical education in the vicinity of his family residence in the\r\ncounty of Monaghan, under the direction of the Rev. Mr. Folds, a\r\nrespectable English clergyman; and at a suitable age, he was sent to the\r\nuniversity of Dublin, where he finished his academical education.\r\nEntirely destitute of fortune, but possessing a strong intellect, stored\r\nwith useful and ornamental learning as well as an ardent and\r\nenterprizing spirit, this young adventurer arrived in Philadelphia soon\r\nafter he had completed his scholastic studies.\r\n\r\nThe writer’s principal design, in presenting to the public view these\r\nslight sketches of the early history of the late Rev. Mr. Barton, shall\r\nbe now explained.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Rittenhouse’s father established his residence at Norriton, and\r\nduring the minority of the son, there were no schools in the vicinity at\r\nwhich any thing more was taught, than reading and writing in the English\r\nlanguage and the simplest rules of arithmetic. Young Mr. Rittenhouse’s\r\nschool-education, in his early youth, was therefore necessarily bounded\r\nby these scanty limits of accessible instruction: He was, in truth,\r\n_taught_ nothing beyond these very circumscribed bounds of literary\r\nknowledge, prior to the nineteenth year of his age; though it is\r\ncertain, that some years before that period of his life, he began to be\r\nknown—at least in his own neighbourhood—as a mathematician and\r\nastronomer, in consequence of his cultivation of the transcendent genius\r\nwith which heaven had endued him.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances as these, the familiar intercourse between\r\nDavid Rittenhouse and his young friend Barton, which commenced when the\r\nage of the former did not exceed nineteen years, could not fail to prove\r\nhighly advantageous to the mental improvement of both. The one possessed\r\na sublime native genius; which, however, was yet but very imperfectly\r\ncultivated, for want of the indispensable means of extending the bounds\r\nof natural knowledge: the other had enjoyed the use of those means, in\r\nan eminent degree, and thus justly acquired the reputation of a man of\r\nlearning. A reciprocation of these different advantages, as may be well\r\nsupposed, greatly promoted the intellectual improvement of both.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily conceived, that Mr. Barton’s knowledge of books must\r\nhave rendered even his conversation instructive to Mr. Rittenhouse, at\r\nso early a period of his life. But the former so greatly admired the\r\nnatural powers of his young friend’s mind, that he took a delight in\r\nobtaining for him access to such philosophical works, and other useful\r\nbooks, as he was then enabled to procure for his use; besides directing,\r\nas far as he was capable, the course of his studies.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Barton’s removal to Philadelphia and while he resided in that\r\ncity, his means of furnishing his friend with books, suitable for his\r\ninstruction, were greatly enlarged; an advantage of which he most\r\nassiduously availed himself: and it is supposed to have been about this\r\ntime, that a small circulating library was established in Norriton, at\r\nthe instance of Mr. Barton, zealously seconded by the co-operation and\r\ninfluence of Mr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nFinally, when Mr. Barton returned from England, in the year 1755—at\r\nwhich time Mr. Rittenhouse was yet but twenty-three years of age, he\r\nbrought with him a valuable addition to his friend’s little library;\r\nconsisting, in part, of books which he himself had commissioned Mr.\r\nBarton to purchase for him.[74]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  The zeal and attention with which our young philosopher pursued his\r\n  early studies, and such mechanical objects as are more intimately\r\n  connected with those branches of natural philosophy to which he was\r\n  most devoted, will appear from the following extract of a letter,\r\n  addressed by him to Mr. Barton, on the 20th of September, 1756, being\r\n  then little more than twenty-four years of age; viz. “I have not\r\n  health for a soldier,” (the country was then engaged in war,) “and as\r\n  I have no expectation of serving my country in that way, I am spending\r\n  my time in the old trifling manner, and am so taken with optics, that\r\n  I do not know whether, if the enemy should invade this part of the\r\n  country, as Archimedes was slain while making geometrical figures on\r\n  the sand, so I should die making a telescope.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNo doubt can be entertained, that Mr. Rittenhouse derived the great and\r\nextraordinary faculties of his mind from nature; and it is equally\r\nevident, that for some years after he arrived to manhood, he possessed\r\nvery slender means of improving his natural talents: Nay further, it is\r\nwell known to those who were long personally acquainted with him, that\r\nafter his removal to Philadelphia, when he was eight-and-thirty years of\r\nage, a period of life at which the place of his residence, and the\r\ncondition of his pecuniary affairs, united in placing within his reach\r\nmuch that is dear to science,—even then, his long continued professional\r\nemployment and the various public stations he filled, in addition to\r\nfrequent ill health, deprived him of a large share of those advantages.\r\nThe vast stock of knowledge which, under such untoward circumstances, he\r\nactually acquired, is therefore an additional proof of his native\r\nstrength of intellect.\r\n\r\nBut, wonderful as a kind of intuitive knowledge he possessed really was,\r\nhis mental powers would probably have remained hidden from the world,\r\nthey would have been very imperfectly cultivated, at best, had not an\r\nincident apparently trivial, and which occurred when our Astronomer was\r\na young boy, furnished what was, in all probability, the very first\r\nincitement to an active employment of his philosophical as well as\r\nmechanical genius.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse’s mother having been already noticed somewhat\r\nparticularly, the reason for this being done shall be here stated: it is\r\nconnected with the incident just now referred to. This valuable woman\r\nhad two brothers, David and Lewis Williams (or William), both of whom\r\ndied in their minority. David, the elder of these, pursued the trade of\r\na carpenter, or joiner. Though, like his nephew and namesake, he was\r\nalmost wholly an uneducated youth, he also, like him, early discovered\r\nan unusual genius and strength of mind. After the death of this young\r\nman, on opening a chest containing the implements of his trade which was\r\ndeposited at Mr. M. Rittenhouse’s, (in whose family it is presumed he\r\ndwelt,) a few elementary books, treating of arithmetic and geometry,\r\nwere found in it: With these, there were also various calculations and\r\nother papers, in manuscript; all, the productions of David Williams\r\nhimself, and such as indicated not only an uncommon genius, but an\r\nactive spirit of philosophical research. To this humble yet valuable\r\ncoffer of his deceased uncle, Mr. Rittenhouse had free access, while yet\r\na very young boy. He often spoke of this acquisition as a treasure;\r\ninasmuch as the instruments of his uncle’s calling afforded him some\r\nmeans of exercising the bent of his genius towards mechanism, while the\r\nbooks and manuscripts early led his mind to those congenial pursuits in\r\nmathematical and astronomical science, which Were ever after the\r\nfavourite objects of his studies.[75]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  It is observable, that, in like manner, an accidental circumstance\r\n  seems to have given the first impulse to the philosophical researches\r\n  of that eminent mathematician, Colin Maclaurin, the friend and\r\n  disciple of Newton. His biographer, Mr. Murdoch, relates, that “his\r\n  genius for mathematical learning discovered itself so early as at\r\n  twelve years of age; when, having accidentally met with a copy of\r\n  Euclid in a friend’s chamber, in a few days he became master of the\r\n  first six books, without any assistance: and thence, following his\r\n  natural bent, made such a surprising progress, that very soon after we\r\n  find him engaged in the most curious and difficult problems.”\r\n\r\n  It is not ascertained at what age Rittenhouse obtained access to his\r\n  uncle Williams’s little collection of books and papers; though it was,\r\n  probably, before his twelfth year. But it is to be observed, that at\r\n  the early age of twelve, Maclaurin had been a year at the University\r\n  of Glasgow, where he was placed under the care of one of the most\r\n  eminent and learned professors of the age; while Rittenhouse, for some\r\n  years after that period of life, had his time occupied in agricultural\r\n  pursuits, and was almost entirely uneducated.\r\n\r\n  One particular in which similar merit attaches itself to these two\r\n  distinguished philosophers, is, that all their more serious studies\r\n  were directed towards objects of general utility.\r\n\r\n  Having introduced the name of Maclaurin more than once into these\r\n  Memoirs, the author of them cannot refrain from presenting to his\r\n  readers the following epitaph upon that great mathematician. It is\r\n  attributed to the late Dr. Johnson: the delicacy and chasteness of the\r\n  sentiment, as well as the classical purity of the language, certainly\r\n  render it a specimen of this species of composition worthy of the pen\r\n  of that justly-admired writer.—\r\n\r\n                               H. L. P. E.\r\n                     Non ut nomine paterno consulat;\r\n                        Nam tali auxilio nil eget;\r\n                      Sed, ut in hoc infelici campo,\r\n                       Ubi luctus regnant et pavor,\r\n                  Mortalibus prorsus non absit solatium:\r\n                        Hujus enim scripta evolve,\r\n                    Mentemque tantarum rerum capacem,\r\n                    Corpori caduco superstitem crede.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n  The writer of the _Adversaria_, in a respectable periodical\r\n  publication,[75a] observes, that “it would not be easy to do justice\r\n  to this elegant and nervous sentence, in English.” But, as he has\r\n  given a very good prose translation of it into our language, the\r\n  subjoined versification of this was attempted by a young lady, at the\r\n  request of the writer of these memoirs:—\r\n\r\n             Not to perpetuate his father’s praise,\r\n               For no such aid his lofty fame requir’d,\r\n             Did filial piety the marble raise;\r\n               But other thoughts the friendly deed inspir’d.\r\n\r\n             Here, in this tearful vale, where sorrow dwells\r\n               And trembling mortals own the reign of fear,\r\n             At his command, the sculptur’d tablet tells,\r\n               Where hope exists, to dry the wand’rer’s tear.\r\n\r\n             For, read his works, O man! and then believe,\r\n               The mind that grasp’d at systems so sublime,\r\n             Beyond the mortal part must ever live,\r\n               And bloom, in sacred heav’n’s ethereal clime.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75a:\r\n\r\n  The Port-Folio.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt being thus apparent, that not only Mr. Rittenhouse’s mother but her\r\nbrother David Williams were persons of uncommon intellectual powers, the\r\nwriter thinks it fairly presumable, that our Astronomer inherited his\r\ngenius from his mother’s family.[76] His surviving brother has decidedly\r\nexpressed this opinion: in a letter on the subject of the deceased,\r\naddressed to the writer of these memoirs soon after Dr. Rittenhouse’s\r\ndeath, he says—“I am convinced his genius was more derived from his\r\nmother, than from his father.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  In order to gratify the curiosity, if not to remove the doubts, of\r\n  such persons as are not disposed to believe in the reality of any\r\n  thing like an hereditary power, bias, or propensity of the mind, the\r\n  following memorable instances are selected from many others which\r\n  might be adduced; to shew that mental faculties, as well as corporeal\r\n  qualities and even mental and bodily diseases, are sometimes inherited\r\n  by children from their parents: perhaps cases of this kind exist more\r\n  frequently than is either observed or imagined.\r\n\r\n  Mr. James Gregory, the inventor of the reflecting telescope in common\r\n  use, called the Gregorian, was one of the most distinguished\r\n  mathematicians of the seventeenth century. This eminent man, who was\r\n  born at Aberdeen in Scotland in the year 1638, was a son of the Rev.\r\n  Mr. John Gregory, minister of Drumoak in the same county: his mother\r\n  was, moreover, a daughter of Mr. David Anderson, of Finzaugh, a\r\n  gentleman who possessed a singular turn for mathematical pursuits.\r\n\r\n  Mr. David Gregory, a nephew of the foregoing, was some time Savilian\r\n  professor of astronomy at Oxford. This _Subtilissimi Ingenii\r\n  Mathematicus_, as he is styled by his successor Dr. Smith, was born at\r\n  Aberdeen, in the year 1661. Of the four sons of this celebrated\r\n  mathematician,—\r\n\r\n  David, a mathematician, was regius professor of modern history, at\r\n  Oxford;\r\n\r\n  James was professor of mathematics, at Edinburgh; and\r\n\r\n  Charles was also professor of mathematics, at St. Andrew’s.\r\n\r\n  Besides these men of genius in the same family, was the late Dr. John\r\n  Gregory, professor of medicine in the University of Edinburgh; who had\r\n  previously held the philosophical chair in the University of St.\r\n  Andrews, from which he delivered lectures on the mathematics,\r\n  experimental philosophy, and moral philosophy. This gentleman was\r\n  grandson of the inventor of the Gregorian telescope, son of Dr. James\r\n  Gregory, professor of medicine at Aberdeen, and father of another\r\n  James, successor of Dr. Cullen, in the medical chair at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n  A mathematical genius was hereditary in the family of the Andersons;\r\n  and, from them, it seems to have been transmitted to their descendants\r\n  of the name of Gregory. Alexander Anderson, cousin-german of David\r\n  abovementioned, was professor of mathematics at Paris, in the\r\n  beginning of the eighteenth century; and published there in 1712,\r\n  _Supplementum Apollonii redivivi_, &c. The mother of the James\r\n  Gregory, first named, inherited the genius of her family; and\r\n  observing in her son, while yet a child, a strong propensity to\r\n  mathematics, she herself instructed him in the elements of that\r\n  science.\r\n\r\n  Margaret, the mother of the late Dr. Thomas Reid, professor of moral\r\n  philosophy in the University of Glasgow, was a daughter of David\r\n  Gregory, Esq. of Kinnardie in Banffshire, elder brother of the James\r\n  Gregory first mentioned. It is remarked by a celebrated writer, that\r\n  “the hereditary worth and genius which have so long distinguished, and\r\n  which still distinguish, the descendants of this memorable family, are\r\n  well known to all who have turned their attention to Scottish\r\n  biography: but it is not known so generally, that in the female line,\r\n  the same characteristical endowments have been conspicuous in various\r\n  instances; and that to the other monuments which illustrate the race\r\n  of the Gregories, is to be added the philosophy of Reid.”—(See Dugald\r\n  Stewart’s _Account of the Life and Writings of Dr. Reid_.)\r\n\r\n  The great mathematical genius of the celebrated astronomer, John\r\n  Dominick Cassini, descended to his great-grandson. John-James, the son\r\n  of John-Dominick, who inherited the genius of his father, succeeded\r\n  him as professor of astronomy in the Royal Observatory at Paris, a\r\n  place which the father had filled more than forty years: John-James’s\r\n  son, Cæsar-Francis Cassini de Thury, (who died in the year 1784, at\r\n  the age of seventy years,) was an eminent astronomer: and his son, the\r\n  Count John-Dominick de Thury, was also a distinguished astronomer.\r\n\r\n  The eldest of these Cassini’s was a native of Italy, and born in 1625.\r\n  He died in the seventy-seventh year of his age; and in the year 1695,\r\n  a medal was struck to honour his memory, by order of the king of\r\n  France.\r\n\r\n  These instances of genius in three families, afford striking examples\r\n  of its being sometimes hereditary. It is further observable, that, in\r\n  the case of the great professor Simson, his mathematical endowments\r\n  were said to be derived from his mother’s family; as Mr. Rittenhouse’s\r\n  were likewise supposed to have been from that of his mother.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA casualty that occurred in the year 1756, appeared to have been very\r\nnear depriving the world of the talents, services, and example of our\r\nPhilosopher, at a very early period of those pursuits in which he was\r\nafterwards so eagerly engaged. This circumstance is thus narrated by\r\nhimself, in a letter dated the 26th of July, in that year, and addressed\r\nto the Rev. Mr. Barton, at his then residence in Redding township, York\r\ncounty.[77]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Barton resided on a farm, near what are called the Sulphur Springs\r\n  (now comprehended within the limits of the new county of Adams,) from\r\n  some time in the year 1755, until the spring of 1759; during which\r\n  period he officiated as a missionary from “the society,” established\r\n  in England, “for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts,” for\r\n  the counties of York and Cumberland. While he resided in that then\r\n  remote settlement of Pennsylvania, he was greatly instrumental, both\r\n  by his precept and example, in stimulating the people to avenge the\r\n  numerous barbarities perpetrated on the inhabitants and their property\r\n  in that frontier, by their French and Indian enemies. In the\r\n  expedition against Fort Du Quesne (now Pittsburg,) undertaken in the\r\n  year 1758, under the orders of brigadier-general Forbes, he served as\r\n  a chaplain to the forces then employed, by virtue of a commission from\r\n  governor Denny: and in that campaign he became personally acquainted\r\n  not only with the commander in chief, but, among others, with colonel\r\n  (afterwards general) Washington; colonel (afterwards general) Mercer;\r\n  colonel Byrd of Virginia; colonel Dagworthy; colonel James Burd of\r\n  Pennsylvania; all provincial officers of great merit; besides colonel\r\n  (afterwards general) Bouquet, sir John St. Clair, sir Peter Hacket,\r\n  major Stewart, and other gentlemen of worth and distinction, who held\r\n  commands in the British regiments engaged in that service. With most\r\n  of these very respectable military characters Mr. Barton occasionally\r\n  corresponded, afterward; and his services, during a residence of\r\n  between three and four years in that part of Pennsylvania, were\r\n  honourably acknowledged, as well in England as among his\r\n  fellow-citizens, in various instances.\r\n\r\n  After Mr. Barton left the county of York, he became established in\r\n  Lancaster, where he officiated as rector of St. James’s church in\r\n  that borough, and missionary to the large and respectable\r\n  country-congregations of Caernarvon and Pequea, nearly twenty years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“I was,” said our young philosopher, “obliged to ride hard to\r\nreach Lancaster, the evening after I left you; and being somewhat\r\ntired myself, as well as my horse, I determined to go to the\r\nDunker’s-Town,[78] where I staid the remainder of that day and the\r\nnight following. I was there entertained with an epitome of all\r\nthe whimsies mankind are capable of conceiving. Yet it seemed to\r\nme the most melancholy place in the world, and I believe would\r\nsoon kill me were I to continue there; though the people were\r\nexceedingly civil and kind, and the situation of the place is\r\npleasant enough.[79] From thence I went homewards, through\r\nReading;[80] where I was agreeably surprised, the number and\r\ngoodness of the buildings far exceeding my expectations.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Although commonly called Dunker’s-Town, the proper name of this once\r\n  noted village is Ephrata. The little community which formerly resided\r\n  there, usually styled Dunkers, date the origin of their sect about the\r\n  year 1705. The original members of this religious society, in Germany,\r\n  Switzerland, and some other parts of Europe, having been persecuted\r\n  and banished from their homes, assembled themselves in the duchy of\r\n  Cleves, under the protection of the king of Prussia: and from thence\r\n  they migrated to Pennsylvania, mostly between the years 1718 and 1734,\r\n  a few of them only remaining behind. See also the next note.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  The proper name of this place is Ephrata; and the very singular\r\n  religious society to whom it belongs, are denominated Seventh-Day\r\n  Baptists.\r\n\r\n  The society is said to have originally consisted of about twenty\r\n  families who migrated from Germany to Pennsylvania, about the year\r\n  1718 or 1719; part of whom settled at this place, and founded the\r\n  village of Ephrata (the head-quarters of the sect,) which is situated\r\n  about thirteen miles, north-eastward, from Lancaster, on a little\r\n  stream called the Cocolico-creek. These people hold the doctrine of an\r\n  universal redemption, ultimately, denying the eternity of future\r\n  punishment; that war and judicial oaths are unchristian; and that it\r\n  is not justifiable to take interest, for money lent. They keep the\r\n  seventh day of the week as their sabbath, and baptize by submersion;\r\n  whence they derive their name: they also inculcate the propriety of\r\n  celibacy, and of maintaining a community of goods; but when any of\r\n  them marry, and acquire property independent of the society in\r\n  Ephrata, they are obliged to retire from thence and reside elsewhere.\r\n  The men generally wear their beards, and clothe themselves in a habit\r\n  not unlike that of the Carmelites or White Friars: the women dress\r\n  like nuns. Both men and women observe great abstemiousness in their\r\n  diet, living chiefly on vegetables, and submit to some privations and\r\n  corporal severities, besides, in their religious discipline; they lie\r\n  upon benches, with a wooden block instead of a pillow: but though\r\n  meek, humble, and even timid, in their deportment, they are very civil\r\n  to strangers who visit them.\r\n\r\n  The society of Ephrata is supported by cultivating their lands,\r\n  conducting a printing-press, a grist-mill, a paper-mill, a saw-mill, a\r\n  tan-yard, &c. and the women are employed in spinning, knitting,\r\n  sewing, making paper-lanterns and other toys, &c.\r\n\r\n  The village consists of about ten or a dozen buildings; and is mostly\r\n  composed of the cloisters and convent, two churches, and the mills.\r\n  One of their places of worship adjoins the sisters’ apartments, as a\r\n  chapel; another belongs to the brothers’ apartments: and to these\r\n  churches, the brethren and the sisterhood respectively resort, every\r\n  morning and evening, sometimes, too, in the night, for the purpose of\r\n  worshipping; much of which is made up of soft and melodious chanting,\r\n  by the females. There is said to be one other place of worship,\r\n  wherein all the members of the society, within the bounds of the\r\n  settlement, meet once a week to celebrate worship publicly.\r\n\r\n  Such, indeed, _was_ the pleasant, sequestered little village of\r\n  Ephrata, at the time our then very young philosopher visited it; and\r\n  such was the condition of that little-known sect of Christians, while\r\n  the society continued under the direction of their second and last\r\n  president, the late Mr. Peter Miller. This venerable old German, who\r\n  had been bred to the priesthood in some one of the Protestant churches\r\n  of his native country, became a convert to the principles of this\r\n  obscure ascetic sect, over which he long presided with much\r\n  reputation, after the death of its reputed founder, CONRAD BEIXLER,\r\n  his patriarchal predecessor. But, though possessing a good share of\r\n  the old scholastic learning, with a large portion of piety, the mind\r\n  of Mr. Miller was strongly tinctured with many mystical notions in\r\n  divinity; such as well comported with the “whimsies” of the religious\r\n  society he governed.\r\n\r\n  Since the death of this good man, the ancient discipline of the\r\n  religious community at Ephrata, which had become greatly relaxed\r\n  during the revolutionary war, has almost wholly disappeared. The chief\r\n  seat of the Seventh-Day Baptists is no longer what it was: for, in\r\n  lieu of the solemn devotional stillness of the secluded cloysters and\r\n  cells of its once monastic inhabitants, and which, at this time, are\r\n  nearly deserted, are now substituted various occupations of industry,\r\n  amidst “the busy haunts of men.”\r\n\r\n  A letter from lady Juliana Penn to the second and last worthy\r\n  president of this little religious society, has a place in the\r\n  Appendix. It is indicative of the goodness of her ladyship’s heart.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  The county-town of Berks, in Pennsylvania, pleasantly situated on the\r\n  Schuylkill, about fifty-six miles, north-westward, from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“You have perhaps seen, in one of the last papers, an account of the\r\nprodigiously large hail-stones which fell in Plymouth.[81] The lightning\r\nstruck a tall green poplar standing in our meadow, just before the door,\r\nand levelled it with the earth. I was standing between the tree and\r\nhouse; and, at the same instant that I saw the flash of lightning, felt\r\na most violent shock through my whole body,—and was stunned with such a\r\nhorrible noise, that it is impossible for imagination to represent any\r\nthing like it.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  A neighbouring township to Norriton, the place of Mr. Rittenhouse’s\r\n  country residence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe advantages and the disadvantages, which Mr. Rittenhouse respectively\r\nenjoyed and encountered, until after he had attained to the period of\r\nmanhood, have been mentioned; and it will be readily perceived, that the\r\nlatter greatly outweighed the former, in every other particular than\r\nthat of his native genius, which alone was sufficient to preponderate\r\nagainst innumerable difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe great deficiencies in his education, as well as their causes, having\r\nbeen misconceived and incorrectly represented in some publications, a\r\ndue regard to truth demands a correction of such mistaken opinions. Soon\r\nafter his death, there appeared in the Maryland Journal, “_Anecdotical\r\nNotices of Mr. David Rittenhouse_;” which, although written with some\r\ningenuity and knowledge of the subject, contained several errors. It is\r\ntherein asserted, among other things, that “his parents, _incapable_ of\r\ngiving him any other education than common reading and writing, intended\r\nto have brought him up to country-business; but, being blessed by nature\r\nwith a mechanical turn of mind, he soon gave specimens of his ingenuity\r\nin making wooden clocks: This so recommended him to notice, as to give\r\nhim an opportunity of learning the clock-making business.”—It has been\r\nalready shewn, that Mr. Rittenhouse never received the least instruction\r\nin any mechanic art; and it is not ascertained that he ever made more\r\nthan one wooden clock. It is also notoriously an error, that his parents\r\nwere “incapable” of giving him any other education, than the common\r\nschooling he received: they were by no means poor, though not wealthy.\r\nHis father inherited some patrimony; and he had, besides, been about\r\nnine years concerned in conducting the paper-manufactory near\r\nGermantown, after his one-and-twentieth year, before he purchased the\r\nNorriton farm.[82] This part of his estate he was enabled to give to his\r\neldest son, David, about the year 1764; prior to which time the old\r\ngentleman removed to a farm he had purchased, nearly adjoining it in\r\nWorcester township, and on which he had erected a good two-story stone\r\ndwelling-house with suitable out-houses. There Mr. David Rittenhouse’s\r\nfather and mother afterwards resided, together with their other son,\r\nBenjamin, (the house being so constructed as, conveniently, to\r\naccommodate two small families,) until the death of old Mrs. Rittenhouse\r\nin the autumn of 1777, at the age of seventy-three years, and of her\r\nhusband in the autumn of 1780, in the seventy-eighth year of his age.\r\nThe Worcester farm was left to the younger son: and, in addition to\r\nthese not inconsiderable establishments for his sons, the old gentleman\r\nhad given small portions to each of his five daughters, when they\r\nseverally married. The remains of this worthy and upright man, for he\r\ntruly merited that character, were interred in the cemetery belonging to\r\na Baptist congregation, in the neighbourhood, in which both he and his\r\nwife had long attended divine worship. But, some years before his death,\r\nthe old gentleman disposed of a lot of ground very near to his own\r\nhouse,—and _gratuitously_, if the writer’s information be correct,—to a\r\nPresbyterian congregation, for a burial place, and site for a church\r\nthey were then about to erect. If this little piece of land was a\r\n_donation_ to the religious society to whom it belongs, the grant of it,\r\nthough not of great value, furnishes an instance of that liberality of\r\nsentiment and goodness of heart which characterized our Astronomer’s\r\nfather, and to which some allusion is before made.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  This farm contained about one hundred and fifty acres. It was lately\r\n  sold by the heirs of Dr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, all the circumstances here mentioned, respecting\r\nMatthias Rittenhouse’s property and condition of life, shall be taken\r\ninto view, it will be evident that he possessed a decent competency;\r\nwith an estate quite independent, though not large: for he never enjoyed\r\nwhat is now termed affluence.\r\n\r\nConcerning our Astronomer’s early life and condition, even his eloquent\r\neulogist, Dr. Rush, was mistaken in some particulars. His assertion,\r\nthat Mr. Rittenhouse was descended from parents “distinguished for\r\nprobity, industry, and simple manners,” is perfectly correct. But,\r\nalthough he was comparatively “humble” in his “origin,” his father held\r\nthe highly respectable station of an intelligent, independent\r\nfarmer;[83] and it has been also seen, that his paternal ancestors, for\r\nsome generations in succession, were proprietors of considerable\r\nmanufactories of an article important in commerce and the arts, and\r\neminently useful in literature and science as well as in the common\r\naffairs of life.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  “Omnium autem rerum, ex quibus aliquid acquiritur, nihil est\r\n  agriculturâ melius, nihil uberius, nihil dulcius, nihil homine, nihil\r\n  libero dignius,” Cic. _De Offic._ ii. 42.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Rush has remarked, in regard to Mr. Rittenhouse’s talents first\r\nbecoming generally known, that “the discovery of his uncommon merit\r\nbelonged chiefly to his brother-in-law, the Rev. Mr. Barton, Dr. Smith,\r\nand the late Mr. John Lukens.” Perhaps it might be said, with greater\r\nstrictness, that the “discovery” here spoken of, belonged solely to Mr.\r\nBarton; by whom it was communicated, very early, to his learned and\r\nreverend friend, Dr. Smith,—and through him, to the ingenious\r\nastronomical observer, Mr. Lukens, (afterwards surveyer-general,) as\r\nwell as some other distinguished characters of that time. The writer in\r\nthe Maryland paper before referred to, after having noticed the\r\nprevailing opinion that Mr. Rittenhouse was _self-taught_, had corrected\r\nthe full extent of that misconception, in these words: “This is not\r\nstrictly true; for, while engaged in these acquirements,” (astronomy,\r\n&c.) “the Rev. Mr. Barton, a learned episcopal clergyman of Lancaster,\r\nmarried his sister.”——“Mr. Barton, admiring the simplicity of manners\r\nand natural genius of his brother-in-law, afforded him every assistance\r\nin his power,—not only in mathematics, but in several other branches of\r\nliterature: Mr. Rittenhouse was worthy of his notice; for he lost no\r\ntime, and spared no pains, to improve himself in knowledge, as far as\r\nhis limited education would permit.”\r\n\r\nHence, as well as from the preceding narrative, it will appear that Dr.\r\nRush was led into a further mistake, respecting Mr. Rittenhouse.—In\r\nregard to his exalted genius, the learned professor has amply done\r\njustice to his memory. He has, in particular, recorded one extraordinary\r\nfact, in proof of his genius, well worthy of notice; and which is\r\ntherefore related in the Professor’s own words.——“It was during the\r\nresidence of our ingenious philosopher with his father, in the country,\r\nthat he made himself master of Sir Isaac Newton’s _Principia_, which he\r\nread in the English translation of Mr. Motte. It was here, likewise, he\r\nbecame acquainted with the science of Fluxions; of which sublime\r\ninvention he believed himself, for a while, to be the author: nor did he\r\nknow for some years afterwards, that a contest had been carried on\r\nbetween Sir Isaac Newton and Leibnitz, for the honour of that great and\r\nuseful discovery.” Then exclaims the ingenious eulogist, in terms of\r\nwell-founded admiration, “What a mind was here!”—But, immediately after,\r\nhe adds—“_Without literary friends or society, and with but two or three\r\nbooks_, he became, before he had reached his four-and-twentieth year,\r\nthe rival of two of the greatest mathematicians in Europe!”—The\r\ncircumstance must, then, have escaped Dr. Rush’s recollection—if indeed\r\nhe had ever been made acquainted with it,—that five years before Mr.\r\nRittenhouse attained to the age of twenty-four, he found at least one\r\nliterary friend, in Mr. Barton; whose intimate society he long enjoyed,\r\nprior to that period; and that, through his means, he had access to many\r\nbooks.[84]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  The opinion, that Mr. Rittenhouse was, in his youth and the first\r\n  years of his manhood, “without literary friends or society, and with\r\n  but two or three books,” though erroneous in fact, was propagated\r\n  pretty early; and that opinion has, since, generally prevailed. About\r\n  twenty-two years before his death, a book was published in\r\n  Philadelphia, under the title of _Caspipina’s Letters_; of which the\r\n  Rev. Mr. Duché, then assistant-minister of Christ-church and St.\r\n  Peter’s in that city, was the writer. In that pleasant little work,\r\n  its amiable and worthy author (who has been dead many years) has thus\r\n  mentioned our philosopher. “After taking a few turns in the garden, we\r\n  walked back again to the college, where we had appointed to meet the\r\n  modest and ingenious Mr. Rittenhouse, who, _without one single\r\n  advantage from a private tutor_, or public education, by the mere\r\n  force of genius and industry, may now justly be reckoned the first\r\n  astronomer and mathematician in the world.”\r\n\r\n  Under such circumstances as these, it is by no means a matter of\r\n  surprise, that Dr. Rush should have been led into a similar mistake.\r\n\r\n  It is, nevertheless, truly astonishing to find an American writer (the\r\n  late Rev. Mr. Linn,) who, five years after Dr. Rittenhouse’s death,\r\n  published in Philadelphia, where both resided, a poem entitled, “The\r\n  Powers of Genius;” but, in which the name of RITTENHOUSE is not once\r\n  noticed! And yet that gentleman had not omitted to introduce, in one\r\n  of his notes, an observation which shews, that an European\r\n  philosopher, also of sublime genius, was present to his mind’s\r\n  eye!—“From the exhibitions of American talents,” said Mr. Linn, “I\r\n  indulge the warmest expectations. I behold, in imagination, the\r\n  NEWTONS, the Miltons, and the Robertsons, of this new world; and I\r\n  behold the sun of genius” (likewise “in imagination,” it is presumed,)\r\n  “pouring on our land his meridian beams.”\r\n\r\n  The writer of these memoirs believes Dr. Linn to have been a very\r\n  worthy, as well as an ingenious man: as such, he regrets his premature\r\n  death, and entertains a respect for his memory. But he could not, in\r\n  justice to the merit of Dr. Rittenhouse’s character, pass unnoticed so\r\n  unaccountable an omission as the one just mentioned, in Dr. Linn’s\r\n  Poem.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is not meant to be insinuated, however, that Mr. Barton ever gave Mr.\r\nRittenhouse any insight into the knowledge of fluxions; or, indeed, much\r\ninstruction, if any at all, in other of the higher branches of\r\nmathematics: because the first named gentleman never did himself pretend\r\nto the character of a profound mathematician; and because, likewise,\r\nalthough always esteemed a man of learning, his pursuits in science and\r\nliterature were chiefly directed to objects of a different nature. That\r\nMr. Rittenhouse derived some instruction and information from his early\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Barton, is certain: but, whatever may have been\r\nthe extent of the literary advantages which the latter was enabled to\r\nconfer on his young friend and companion, they could not in any degree\r\nderogate from the intrinsic excellence and greatness of our Astronomer’s\r\ninnate genius.\r\n\r\nThat a mind so formed as that of our young philosopher—situated in life\r\nas he was—should have impelled him to assume the business of\r\nclock-making, can not be a matter of surprize: this occupation,\r\nconnected with that of a mathematical instrument maker, is such as may\r\nbe well supposed to have presented itself to his youthful ingenuity;\r\nbeing in accordance with the philosophical bent of his genius in his\r\nearly years, while yet untutored in science and unknown to the world.\r\n\r\nThe great utility of the common clock, in measuring time, is universally\r\nknown. It possesses numerous and manifest advantages, beyond those of\r\nsun-dials, clepsydræ, sand-glasses, and other horological instruments,\r\nby reason of its vastly superior accuracy: the sun-dial, indeed, is\r\noftentimes wholly useless in all situations, even in the day-time; and\r\nalways necessarily so, at night.\r\n\r\nBut the many improvements which have been made in modern times, in\r\nchronometers,—more especially in pendulum-clocks,—have very much\r\nadvanced a correspondent accuracy in astronomical observations:\r\nand these improvements, together with those lately made in\r\ntelescopes—chiefly by Dr. Herschel, the discoverer of the\r\n_Georgium Sidus_[85]—afford good grounds for hoping, that yet\r\nfarther and more important additions will continue to be made to\r\nthe recent discoveries in astronomy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Herschel, by means of his admirable telescopes, the most powerful\r\n  that have ever been constructed, discovered on the 13th of March,\r\n  1781, a new planet without the orbit of Saturn, called the _Georgium\r\n  Sidus_. The newly discovered star was thus named by Dr. Herschel\r\n  himself, in honour of his patron King George III. by whose bounty he\r\n  was enabled to construct, and to make incessant and laborious\r\n  observations with those wonderful telescopes, by which this astronomer\r\n  has extended our knowledge of the planetary and sidereal system, far\r\n  beyond its former limits.[85a]\r\n\r\n  Some astronomers on the continent of Europe, and in America likewise,\r\n  have affected to call this new planet _Herschel_; while others have\r\n  endeavoured to give it the name of _Uranus_. Would it not be well, in\r\n  order to avoid the perplexity and confusion arising from various names\r\n  for the same thing, that astronomers of eminence should designate this\r\n  planet, in future, by the name which the discoverer—who, it may be\r\n  presumed, was best entitled to give it a denomination—chose to apply\r\n  to it? It is a strange kind of compliment to Dr. Herschel, if it could\r\n  have been intended as a mark of respect to him, to refuse an adoption\r\n  of that name which he had assigned to his own discovery; even by\r\n  changing it for that of the Doctor himself! He wished this planet, no\r\n  doubt, to retain the appellation of _Georgium Sidus_, as a memorial of\r\n  his grateful respect for his royal benefactor; and in this object of\r\n  his wish he would be disappointed, by changing it for any other.\r\n\r\n  The name _Uranus_ is also objectionable, and on another ground. Uranus\r\n  was a fabulous personage. It is pretended, that in the isle called\r\n  _Panchay_,[85b] to the east of Africa, is to be seen on a column of\r\n  gold, a recital of the principal actions of Uranus, together with\r\n  those of Saturn and Jupiter. It is said that the former was the most\r\n  ancient king in the world; and that, having been a just and beneficent\r\n  man, well versed in the knowledge of the stars, he was the first who\r\n  offered sacrifices to the gods of heaven. We are also told, that in\r\n  the island just named is a mountain, where Uranus, holding the sceptre\r\n  of the world, took great pleasure in contemplating the firmament and\r\n  the stars. Among the sons of this monarch, according to the same\r\n  fiction, the two most distinguished were Atlas and Saturn, who\r\n  partitioned between them their father’s kingdom; and Atlas, who in the\r\n  division acquired the sea-coasts, is said to have excelled in\r\n  astrology: his reign is placed about sixteen hundred years before the\r\n  Christian era, and he is therefore ranked as a co-temporary of Moses.\r\n\r\n  Such is the fabulous history of Uranus! whose name some Christian\r\n  philosophers seem desirous to perpetuate, with honour, by attaching it\r\n  to a newly-discovered world! It would be extremely difficult if not\r\n  impracticable (and, perhaps, even if practicable, the attempt would\r\n  not be advisable at this time of day,) to abolish such of the names of\r\n  the heavenly bodies as are derived from the appellations of the false\r\n  gods of antiquity. But it appears very questionable, whether it be\r\n  consistent with propriety and a due regard to truth, to connect fable,\r\n  in any manner, with established and important realities; or whether it\r\n  be right to dignify the heathen mythology and the preposterous annals\r\n  of fabulous ages, by unnecessarily associating any thing relating to\r\n  them, with objects of genuine and useful science.\r\n\r\n  Baron Bielfeld seems to entertain similar sentiments on this head,\r\n  when (treating of the mathematics, in his “Elements of Universal\r\n  Erudition,”) he observes, that “the fables of ancient poets concerning\r\n  the stars, and,” he adds, “the fancies of some modern Christian\r\n  astronomers, who have given them names borrowed from the holy\r\n  scriptures, do not deserve the least attention, when we would treat\r\n  seriously on this science.” There is much justness in this observation\r\n  of the learned and ingenious baron: But if the application of names\r\n  derived from sacred writ, to the stars, be censurable; how much to be\r\n  condemned among Christians is the practice of giving, even in our day,\r\n  and in a science which has philosophical truth for its object, the\r\n  names of heathen deities, and fabulous persons of antiquity, to the\r\n  celestial bodies! Is it proper, can it, in any way, promote the\r\n  interests of true science or the attainment of useful knowledge, thus\r\n  to commemorate any of the absurdities of a false and impious\r\n  mythology; or any of those traditional personages of the early ages,\r\n  whose history, as handed down to us in the reveries of the ancient\r\n  poets and other profane writers, are either enveloped in fable or\r\n  inexplicable mystery? But to return from this digression:—\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lalande remarks in his great work on astronomy, which was\r\n  published in the year 1792, that Louis XIV. gave to astronomers\r\n  unceasing marks of the interest he took in their labours; and that\r\n  George III. occupied, with great delight, much of his time in his\r\n  Observatory at Richmond, as well as in Herschel’s at Slough. In his\r\n  own, in Richmond Gardens, the king of England has noble and beautiful\r\n  instruments; among which are a mural arch of 140° and 8 feet radius,\r\n  made by Sisson, a sector of 12 feet, a transit telescope of 8 feet,\r\n  made by Adams, and a telescope of 10 feet of Herschel. This grand\r\n  Observatory was erected in the year 1770, under the direction of Dr.\r\n  Bevis: it is 140 feet in front, and consists of two stories.\r\n\r\n  Such princes, then, as Louis XIV. and George III. deserve to be\r\n  honourably mentioned in the records of astronomical science: and it\r\n  was meritorious in Dr. Herschel, to dedicate to so munificent a patron\r\n  and promoter of astronomy as the latter sovereign, in the way he has\r\n  done, his important discovery of a new planet.\r\n\r\n  It is noticed by the writer of the article “Astronomy,” in Dr.\r\n  Brewster’s _New Edinburgh Encyclopædia_, (the first volume of which\r\n  has been very lately reprinted in Philadelphia,) that the venerable\r\n  Herschel,[85c] at the advanced age of seventy-two years, still\r\n  continued to observe the heavens with the most unwearied assiduity:\r\n  and that his contemplated “successor,” who, it is presumed, is his\r\n  son, “promises to inherit the virtues and the talents of his father.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 85a:\r\n\r\n  Herschel, in calling his newly-discovered planet by the name of his\r\n  patron, was not without illustrious precedents for so doing. When\r\n  Galileo discovered the four Satellites of Jupiter, in the year 1610,\r\n  he named them the _Medicea Sidera_, in honour of the family of Medici,\r\n  his patrons. And Cassini, who, in the years 1671, 1672, and 1684,\r\n  successively, discovered the fifth, the third, and the first and\r\n  second Satellites of Saturn, denominated these stars, _Sidera\r\n  Lodoicea_, in honour of Louis XIV. in whose reign, and observatory,\r\n  they were first discovered. The fourth Satellite of Saturn (but the\r\n  first of them, in the order of time, that was known) had been\r\n  previously discovered by Huygens, sixteen years before any one of the\r\n  others was known to exist.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85b:\r\n\r\n  So written by Lalande. There is an Asiatic island called _Panay_: it\r\n  is one of the Philippines, and lies, as _Panchay_ is said to do, “to\r\n  the east of Africa.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 85c:\r\n\r\n            “Herschel, with ample mind and magic glass,\r\n            Mid worlds and worlds revolving as they pass,\r\n            Pours the full cluster’d radiance from on high,\r\n            That fathomless abyss of Deity.”\r\n                             _Purs. of Lit._ dial. the fourth.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFurther improvements may also be expected to take place, in the\r\nconstruction of watches and other spring-chronometers; so as to render\r\nthem still more useful for the purposes of navigation, by ascertaining\r\nwith greater precision the longitude at sea.[86] For this purpose, the\r\nfinely-improved English time-keepers of Harrison, Mudge, and others,\r\nhave been found of the greatest utility. Mr. de Zach, (in his\r\nExplanation and uses of the Tables of the Motions of the Sun,[87]) after\r\nsome observations on determining differences of longitude by means of\r\nastronomical observation, says,[88]—“De cæteris longitudinem\r\ndeterminandi modis, non est hic disserendi locus;—de uno vero, horologiâ\r\nmaritimâ seu nauticâ, quidquam adjicere non alienum erit. Triginta jam\r\nabhinc annis, ingeniosissimi horologiorum artifices, Harrison, Cummings,\r\nKendal, Arnold, Mudge, apud Anglos,—Le Roy et Berthoud apud Gallos,\r\nvaria navigantium usui, egregia excogitaverant, et ad magnum perduxerant\r\nperfectionis gradum, horologia nautica, (Anglis, Time-keeper.)

The Regent of France, during the\r\n  minority of Louis XV. also promised a great reward to any person who\r\n  should discover the longitude at sea.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1714, the parliament of Great Britain offered a reward for\r\n  a like discovery; and if the method, to be proposed, should determine\r\n  the longitude to twenty geographical miles, the premium was to be\r\n  twenty-thousand pounds sterling. The act of parliament established a\r\n  board of Commissioners of the Longitude. Several other acts were\r\n  passed, in the reigns of Geo. II. and III. directed to the same\r\n  purpose. Finally, in the year 1774, all those acts were repealed, by\r\n  one offering separate premiums for finding the longitude; either by\r\n  the lunar method, or by a watch keeping true time,—or by any other\r\n  method practicable at sea. This act proposes as a reward for a\r\n  time-keeper, 5000_l._, if it determine the longitude to one degree or\r\n  sixty geographical miles,—7500_l._, if to forty miles,—and 10,000_l._,\r\n  if to thirty miles. If the method be by improved Solar and Lunar\r\n  Tables, constructed upon Sir Isaac Newton’s theory of gravitation, the\r\n  author is to receive 5000_l._; provided such Tables shall show the\r\n  distance of the Moon from the Sun and Stars within fifteen seconds of\r\n  a degree, answering to about seven minutes of longitude, after making\r\n  an allowance of a half a degree for the errors of observation. The\r\n  Commissioners have the power of giving smaller rewards, at their\r\n  discretion, to persons making any discovery for finding the longitude\r\n  at sea, though it may not be within the above limits.\r\n\r\n  The set of Solar and Lunar Tables which were sent to the Board of\r\n  Longitude, about the year 1763, by the widow of the celebrated\r\n  astronomer, Tobias Mayer, were honoured with a reward of 3000_l._\r\n  sterling, by an act of the British parliament, in consideration of\r\n  their great usefulness in finding the longitude at sea.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  See Mr. de Zach’s great work, entitled, _Tabulæ Motuum Solis novæ et\r\n  correctæ_, &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  For the use of such readers as may not be acquainted with the Latin\r\n  language, the following translation of the above is given, from the\r\n  original of Mr. de Zach.\r\n\r\n  “Concerning the means of determining the longitude, this is not the\r\n  proper place to treat: of one, however, the marine or nautical\r\n  time-keeper, it will not be foreign to our purpose to say something.\r\n\r\n  “It is now about thirty years, since those very ingenious makers of\r\n  time-keepers, Harrison, Cummings, Kendal, Arnold, and Mudge, among the\r\n  English,—Le Roy, and Berthoud, among the French,—devised various and\r\n  excellent ones for the use of navigators, and brought to a great\r\n  degree of perfection those marine watches, called by the English,\r\n  Time-keepers. As every one knows their use in ascertaining the\r\n  longitude, on a _sea-voyage_, I shall not say any thing more of them\r\n  here.—A similar time-piece, made by the celebrated watch-maker Mr.\r\n  Thomas Mudge, and often referred to in the royal observatory of\r\n  Greenwich, was, in 1784, made use of by the Hon. Vice-Admiral (John)\r\n  Campbell, commander of the naval squadron[88a] on the Newfoundland\r\n  station,—going thither and returning; and from that time was\r\n  diligently examined, at the observatory of his Excellency Count Bruhl,\r\n  in Dover street London.\r\n\r\n  “This very marine time-piece was confided to my charge, in the year\r\n  1786, for the purpose of determining the longitudes of my journey by\r\n  land; when, called from London by his Serene Highness the Duke of\r\n  Saxe-Gotha,—the patron of all the sciences and liberal arts, but more\r\n  especially favouring astronomy,—I returned to Germany; where the\r\n  erecting of a complete and splendid Observatory, at Gotha, was placed\r\n  under my direction.[88b] I then took with me, by the command of his\r\n  Serene Highness, a watch of a smaller size, which he usually carried\r\n  in his fob,—called by the English a Pocket-chronometer,—made by a\r\n  London artist, Mr. Josiah Emery:[88c] which, being made with the\r\n  greatest accuracy and ingenuity, yielded nothing in point of\r\n  correctness to the larger nautical time-keepers, as may be seen from\r\n  three tables of their movements by the illustrious Count Bruhl, and\r\n  also of others, by Dr. Arnold, lately established by authenticated\r\n  certificates.\r\n\r\n  “About the end of the year 1786 and the beginning of 1787, I\r\n  accompanied His Serene Highness, in a tour through Germany, France and\r\n  Italy. In this journey, the longitudes of several places and\r\n  astronomical observatories were determined, from a comparison of the\r\n  time of a nautical time-keeper (which was set by the solar mean time\r\n  in Dover street, London,) with the mean time of the place; which\r\n  appears by the altitudes of the sun, by Hadley’s sextant—those which\r\n  we call _corresponding_, or by a comparison with it, as transmitted to\r\n  us in observatories, by those astronomers. By the same instruments,\r\n  therefore, when I arrived at Gotha, I ascertained the longitude of the\r\n  future observatory there, with the greatest care and attention; which\r\n  the Duke, going to London a few days after, taking with him his\r\n  chronometer, at length fully verified.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 88a:\r\n\r\n  Here is a reference, in the text, to note 89.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88b:\r\n\r\n  Here is a reference, in the text, to note 90.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88c:\r\n\r\n  Here is a reference, in the text, to note 91.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  Sundry astronomical observations were made by this officer, while a\r\n  captain in the British navy, in the years 1757, 8, and 9; which were\r\n  reported to the admiralty on the 14th of April, 1760, by Dr. Bradley,\r\n  then astronomer-royal. See Dr. Bradley’s letter of that date, to the\r\n  Secretary of the Admiralty; published (among other papers) in the year\r\n  1770, by order of the board of longitude, at the end of T. Mayer’s\r\n  Tables and Method of finding the Longitude; edited by Dr. Maskelyne.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  The Observatory, a very handsome and respectable one, was constructed\r\n  at Gotha in the year 1788, under the auspices of the then reigning\r\n  Duke of Saxe-Gotha, a zealous patron of astronomy. It is placed on an\r\n  eminence, a league from the city, and is built entirely of hewn stone.\r\n  Mr. de Zach, a native of Hungary, an experienced astronomer, was\r\n  appointed by the duke its director.\r\n\r\n  The instruments with which the Gotha Observatory is furnished are\r\n  chiefly English, as are those of most of the celebrated European\r\n  observatories. Among these, is a transit telescope, by Ramsden; and\r\n  Mr. Lalande mentions, in his _Astronomie_ (in the year 1792,) that\r\n  there were to be added, two murals of eight feet radius, an entire\r\n  circle of eight feet diameter, a great zenith-sector, &c. but that Mr.\r\n  Ramsden, who was employed to make them, found great difficulty in\r\n  supplying all the demands for instruments, which his great reputation\r\n  occasioned.\r\n\r\n  It is well known, that the first improvements in astronomical\r\n  instruments took place in Great-Britain; and both Lalande and de Zach,\r\n  as well as other foreign astronomers of eminence, have done ample\r\n  justice to the superior ingenuity and skill of the artists of that\r\n  country, in this department of mechanism. The ingenious Mr. Edmund\r\n  Stone, in his _Supplement to the English Translation of Mr. Bion’s\r\n  Construction and Use of Mathematical Instruments_, (published in 1758,\r\n  nearly forty years after he translated Mr. Bion’s work into English,)\r\n  observes—that, having set about the business (the translating of this\r\n  latter work,) he soon perceived that many French instruments were\r\n  excelled by some of the English of the same kind, in contrivance; and\r\n  that, as to workmanship, he never did see one French instrument so\r\n  well framed and divided as some English have been. “For example,” says\r\n  Mr. Stone, “Mr. Sutton’s quadrants, made above one hundred years ago,”\r\n  (before the middle of the seventeenth century,) “are the finest\r\n  divided instruments in the world; and the regularity and exactness of\r\n  the vast number of circles drawn upon them, is highly delightful to\r\n  behold. The mural quadrant at the Royal Observatory, at Greenwich, far\r\n  exceeds that of the Royal Observatory at Paris. Also, the theodolites\r\n  of Messrs. Sisson and Heath, the clocks and watches of Messrs. Graham,\r\n  Tompion and Quare, the orreries of Mr. Graham and Mr. Wright, and many\r\n  more curiously contrived and well executed mathematical instruments\r\n  which I could mention, far exceed those of the French, or indeed any\r\n  other nation in the world.—The making good mathematical instruments,”\r\n  continues Mr. Stone, “is almost peculiar to the English; as well as\r\n  their skill in all branches of the mathematics and natural philosophy\r\n  has been generally superior to that of other nations.”\r\n\r\n  Without wishing to derogate from the justly acquired fame of British\r\n  artists, for the excellence of their mathematical and astronomical\r\n  instruments, M. Rittenhouse’s skill and accuracy, displayed in such as\r\n  he made, stand unsurpassed by similar works of their most celebrated\r\n  mechanicians: while his profoundness in astronomical science, and his\r\n  wonderful ingenuity of invention and contrivance, manifested in the\r\n  construction of his Orrery, leave him without a rival, in the two-fold\r\n  character of an Astronomer and a Mechanic. The idea of the fine\r\n  planetarian machine constructed by Mr. Rowley, under the name of the\r\n  Orrery, and supposed to have been invented by Mr. Graham, is said to\r\n  have been taken from a very similar machine, of which that eminent\r\n  philosopher, Dr. Stephen Hales, had the credit of being the original\r\n  contriver. But Mr. Rittenhouse was, incontrovertibly, the Inventor, as\r\n  well as the Maker, of that sublimely-conceived and unrivalled machine,\r\n  which bears the name of the Rittenhouse-Orrery: and Dr. Morse, in\r\n  noticing some of the more prominent productions of scientific\r\n  ingenuity and skill, in America, observes, with good reason, that\r\n  “every combination of machinery may be expected from a country, a\r\n  native son of which,” (referring in a note to “David Rittenhouse, Esq.\r\n  of Pennsylvania,”) “reaching this inestimable object in its highest\r\n  point, has epitomised the motions of the spheres that roll throughout\r\n  the universe.” See Morse’s _American Geography_, first published in\r\n  1789.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  The accuracy of some of the fine pocket-chronometers constructed by\r\n  the celebrated artists named by Mr. de Zach, and by some others, such,\r\n  for instance, as the one made by Emery for the count de Bruhl,\r\n  mentioned in the text, has rendered them, on some occasions, useful\r\n  assistants in making astronomical observations on land. Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse occasionally used one for such purposes, many years. It\r\n  was an excellent pocket-watch, made by Le Roy of Paris for the late\r\n  Matthias Barton, Esq. who was induced to let Dr. Rittenhouse have it.\r\n  After his decease, this watch was gratuitously restored to its former\r\n  proprietor, by Mrs. Rittenhouse’s desire, and as a testimonial of what\r\n  she knew to have been her late husband’s regard for his nephew. Mr. M.\r\n  Barton bequeathed it, by his last will, to his brother and physician,\r\n  Dr. Benjamin S. Barton.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis very respectable testimony of an eminent German astronomer affords\r\nincontestable proof of the great accuracy, of which nautical\r\nchronometers are susceptible, and to which they have actually been\r\nbrought by some artists of celebrity, mostly English.[92]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  The Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, for the year\r\n  1729, contain an article that furnishes additional evidence of the\r\n  extraordinary skill and ingenuity manifested by English artists in the\r\n  construction of watches, as well as other pieces of mechanism which\r\n  require great accuracy in the workmanship: it forms a pleasant little\r\n  narrative in an eulogium on Father Sebastian,[92a] a Carmelite Friar\r\n  of singular mechanical ingenuity; and it indicates, at the same time,\r\n  that the repeating-watch was invented in England. The story is thus\r\n  told:—\r\n\r\n  “Charles II. roy d’Angleterre, avoit envoyé au feu roi deux Montres à\r\n  Repetition; _les premieres qu’on ait vues en France_. Elles ne\r\n  pouvoient s’ouvrir que par une secrete précaution des ouvriers\r\n  Anglois, pour cacher la nouvelle construction, et s’en assurer\r\n  d’autant plus la gloire et le profit. Les montres se dérangérent, et\r\n  furent remises entre les mains de M. Martineau, horloger du roi, qui\r\n  n’y put travailler faute de les sçavoir ouvrir. Il dit a M. Colbert,\r\n  et c’est un trait de courage digne d’etre remarqué, qu’il ne\r\n  connoissoit qu’un jeune Carme capable d’ouvrir les montres, ques’il\r\n  n’y réussissoit pas, il falloit se resoudre à les renvoyer en\r\n  Angleterre. M. Colbert consentit qu’il les donnât au P. Sebastien, qui\r\n  les ouvrit assez promptement, et de plus les raccommoda sans sçavoir\r\n  qu’ elles étoient au roi, ni combien étoit important par ses\r\n  circonstances l’ouvrage dont on l’avoit chargé.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 92a:\r\n\r\n  His baptismal name was _John Truchet_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe general use of the common clock ought not to derogate from the\r\ningenuity of an invention of such universal importance in the affairs of\r\nhuman life. The pendulum-clock now in use was brought to some degree of\r\nperfection, if not invented, by Huygens,[93] who was one of the first\r\nmathematicians and astronomers of the age in which he lived: and the\r\ndate of this invention is about the middle of the seventeenth century;\r\nalthough Galileo disputed with him the discovery, a few years earlier.\r\nClocks of _some_ kind date their antiquity much higher; some writers\r\npretending to carry their invention back as far as the year 510 of the\r\nChristian era. However, on the authority of Conrad Gesner,[94] the\r\nhonour of inventing the clock, before the application of the pendulum to\r\nthese machines was made by Huygens, belongs to England: He says, that\r\n“Richard Wallingford, an English abbot of St. Albans, who flourished in\r\nthe year 1326, made a wonderful clock by a most excellent art; the like\r\nof which could not be produced in all Europe.”[95] This was forty-six\r\nyears before Henry de Vic, a German, made his clock for Charles V. king\r\nof France; and fifty-six years before the duke of Burgundy ordered one,\r\nwhich sounded the hour, to be carried away from the city of Courtray, in\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  This great man, who was the son of Christian Huygens lord of\r\n  Zuylichem, a counsellor of the prince of Orange, was born in the year\r\n  1629, at Zuylichem, in the province of Guelderland, the country of the\r\n  ancestors of Rittenhouse. Having resided for some time in France, he\r\n  quitted that country on account of his religion, in 1684, in\r\n  consequence of the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He died in\r\n  Holland in 1695, at the age of sixty-six years.\r\n\r\n  Galileo, who was a native of Florence, lived to the age of\r\n  eighty-seven years. He died fifty-three years before Huygens; and\r\n  about fourteen before Huygens’s application of the pendulum to clocks,\r\n  so as to effect an _isochronal_ regulation of their movements.\r\n  Galileo’s use of the pendulum, for the purpose of measuring time,\r\n  seems to have been nothing more than the annexation of a short\r\n  pendulum to clock-work.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  This celebrated naturalist and physician, who was styled by Boerhaave,\r\n  _Monstrum Eruditionis_, was born at Zurich in 1516: He was, probably,\r\n  of the same family as that of the late Solomon Gesner the poet, who\r\n  was a native of the same city, and appeared more than two centuries\r\n  afterwards. Conrad Gesner was so distinguished a writer, as a\r\n  naturalist, that he was called the Pliny of Germany. A splendid\r\n  edition of Pliny’s Natural History, under the title of the _Historia\r\n  Mundi_ of Caius Plinius Secundus, with a dedication by Erasmus to\r\n  Stanislaus Turzo, bishop of Olmutz, was printed at Basil, by Froben,\r\n  so early as 1525. This copy of Pliny (which is now very rare) having\r\n  been published in the vicinity of Conrad Gesner, during his youth,\r\n  that circumstance may have prompted him to direct his attention to\r\n  those pursuits in science, which distinguished this learned Swiss.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  About two centuries after that period when the sciences had begun to\r\n  revive and the mechanical arts to flourish, the construction of clocks\r\n  appears to have been much improved. And in the reign of Henry VIII. a\r\n  stately clock was made by an artist, the initials of whose name are\r\n  “N. O.” in the year 1540, and placed in the royal palace at\r\n  Hampton-Court. This not only shewed the hour of the day, but an\r\n  orrery-part, connected with it, exhibited the motion of the sun\r\n  through all the signs of the zodiac, and also of the moon, with other\r\n  matters depending on them. A similar one, in the cathedral of Lunden\r\n  in Denmark, is mentioned by Heylin: But Martin, in his _Philosophia\r\n  Britannica_, speaks of a piece of clock-work in the cathedral of\r\n  Strasburg, in Alsace; “in which, besides the clock-part, is the\r\n  celestial globe or sphere, with the motions of the sun, moon, planets\r\n  and fixed stars, &c.” This was finished in the year 1574, and is\r\n  represented as being much superior to a pompous clock at Lyons, in\r\n  France, which also has an orrery department.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWithin our own day and a short period of time preceding it,\r\ngreat improvements have been made in the construction of the\r\npendulum-clock,[96] as well as in other descriptions of\r\nChronometers.[97] Mr. Rittenhouse’s early zeal in his practical\r\nresearches into astronomy, prompted him to desire the greatest possible\r\naccuracy in the construction of time-pieces adapted to astronomical\r\npurposes; and uniting, as he did, operative skill with a thorough\r\nknowledge of the principles upon which their construction depends, he\r\nwas enabled—impelled by so powerful a motive—to display to the world, by\r\nhis own manual ingenuity, the near approach to perfection to which the\r\npendulum-chronometer may be brought. Besides his astronomical pursuits,\r\nhis early employment in ascertaining the limits and fixing the\r\nterritorial boundaries of Pennsylvania, and of some of the neighbouring\r\nstates, obliged him to supply himself with chronometers of the greatest\r\npossible accuracy: and these were either made by his own hands, or under\r\nhis immediate inspection by his brother, who, with the aid of his\r\ninstruction, became an excellent mechanician. One of these fine\r\ninstruments, bearing on its face the name of _Benjamin Rittenhouse_ as\r\nthe maker, and the date of the year 1786, is now in the possession of\r\nMr. Norton Prior,[98] of Philadelphia: but that admirable one, the\r\nworkmanship of which was executed by our Philosopher himself, and which\r\nwas part of the apparatus of his Philadelphia Observatory, is now placed\r\nin the hall of the American Philosophical Society.[99] This is\r\nconstructed on a greatly improved plan of his own, which improvement was\r\nafterwards applied to that now belonging to Mr. Prior; and the latter is\r\nthe same chronometer, it is believed, that was used by Mr. D.\r\nRittenhouse, in fixing the northern line which divides Pennsylvania from\r\nNew York, and in establishing the boundary line between the last\r\nmentioned state, and Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, respectively, in\r\nthe years 1786 and 1787.—A description of the principles of his\r\nobservatory-chronometer here mentioned, together with some account of\r\nits mechanism, will be found in the Appendix: the former having been\r\ncommunicated to the writer of these memoirs by the ingenious Robert\r\nPatterson, Esq. director of the Mint; and the latter by that able\r\nmechanician, Mr. Henry Voight, chief coiner in that institution,—a\r\nperson who, by reason of his well-known skill as a clock and\r\nwatch-maker, was employed by Mr. Rittenhouse more than forty years\r\nsince, in the fabrication of some of his philosophical instruments.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  The first pendulum-clock made in England, was in the year 1662, by Mr.\r\n  Fromanteel, a Dutchman.\r\n\r\n  In the library-hall of the Philadelphia Library-Company, is one of the\r\n  clocks made by that artist, having this inscription engraven on its\r\n  face, “_Johannes Fromanteel, Londini, fecit_;” but without any date.\r\n  This clock was a donation to the library-company, in the year 1804, by\r\n  Mr. Samuel Hudson, of Philadelphia, whose ancestor purchased it at an\r\n  auction in London, after the restoration of king Charles II. The\r\n  traditional account of it is, that it belonged, originally, to the\r\n  Cromwell family; and, when presented, was said to be one hundred and\r\n  forty years old: but it could not have been the property of the\r\n  protector, Cromwell, the time of whose death was between three and\r\n  four years anterior to Fromanteel’s construction of a pendulum-clock.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  Besides the testimony of so distinguished an astronomer as Mr. de\r\n  Zach, already given, respecting the very great accuracy to which\r\n  time-keepers have been brought, the following translation, taken from\r\n  what the celebrated Lalande has said in his treatise _Des Horloges\r\n  Astronomiques_, (in the second volume of his _Astronomie_,) furnishes\r\n  some curious and interesting facts on that subject.\r\n\r\n  “Short (the mathematical instrument maker,) upon the occasion of the\r\n  transit of mercury over the sun observed in 1753, assures us that he\r\n  had found by many observations, that his clock had not varied more\r\n  than one second, from the 22d of February to the 6th of May (_Philos.\r\n  Trans._ 1753, p. 200;) so that, with a like pendulum, it is possible\r\n  to obtain an exactness which, till this time, was thought incredible.\r\n  There are English astronomers who have assured me,” continues Lalande,\r\n  “that pendulum-clocks have been made which did not vary more than\r\n  five″ in a year:[97a] but that does not appear to me to be yet\r\n  established as a fact; the oils that one is obliged to use in them are\r\n  sufficient, by the change of consistency they undergo, to prevent such\r\n  preciseness. The count de Bruhl, a great amateur and a perfect\r\n  connoisseur also, on the subject of time-pieces, shewed me in London a\r\n  diary of the going of two pendulums of Mudge, one of the most\r\n  celebrated clock-makers in London: in one, there was a difference of\r\n  half a second a day, between winter and summer; and in the other a\r\n  second. Mr. Aubert has a pendulum made by Shelton, which varies also\r\n  nearly a second in the day, in extreme seasons. Picard, in 1671, had a\r\n  clock which did not lose a second in two months. But, whatever may\r\n  have been, since that period, the skill of the clock-makers of Paris,\r\n  we cannot obtain such exactness, but by mere accident and an equality\r\n  of temperature in the atmosphere that is very rare: now, the\r\n  correctness of our clocks is a necessary consequence of their\r\n  principles; but these do not go so far. Mr. Emery has observed two\r\n  clocks beat the same second, during three months; they were, however,\r\n  very near to each other, and probably had some influence on one\r\n  another by means of their foot-board or support.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 97a:\r\n\r\n  Even watches have been already brought to an inconceivable degree of\r\n  exactness. Mr. Arnold and Mr. Emery made some, in the year 1786, which\r\n  did not vary one second in a voyage of an hundred leagues.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  This gentleman’s name is connected with another circumstance in\r\n  relation to Mr. D. Rittenhouse, which deserves to be noticed. He is in\r\n  possession of a finely-graduated thermometer, made by our Philosopher;\r\n  on the scale of which is engraved, by him, the record of a memorable\r\n  fact concerning the climate of Pennsylvania, referring by a mark to\r\n  22° _below_ 0, of Fahrenheit’s scale; viz.—“_Jan. 2. 1762—Great Cold\r\n  in Pennsylvania_.” This fact was ascertained by Mr. Rittenhouse, from\r\n  a reference to the accurate Messrs. Masons and Dixon’s Journal; in\r\n  which, such was stated to have been the degree of cold in the forks of\r\n  the Brandywine (about thirty miles westward, and very little to the\r\n  southward, from Philadelphia,) on the day mentioned.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse had noticed, that, at his Norriton Observatory, (in\r\n  lat. 40° 9′ 31″ N.) the mercury in Fahrenheit’s thermometer, not\r\n  exposed to the sun-shine but open to the air, was at 94½°, on the 5th\r\n  of July 1769; “which,” says he, “was the greatest height it had ever\r\n  been observed to rise to, at that place.” But the writer is informed\r\n  by a judicious and attentive observer, that at Lancaster,\r\n  Pennsylvania, which is in lat. 40° 2′ 39″ N. (the long. of this\r\n  borough-town is 5^h 1′ 4″ W. from Greenw.) the mercury rose by\r\n  Fahrenheit’s scale, on the 7th of July, 1811, to 97½°. Admitting this\r\n  to be correct, if 1½° be then deducted, for the extra heat of so large\r\n  a town as Lancaster in comparison with a country-situation, there is\r\n  in this case the great range of 118° by Fahrenheit’s scale, for the\r\n  extremes of heat and cold in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  The writer brought with him, from England, a meteorological diary kept\r\n  in London, during the severe frost there, from the 7th day of January,\r\n  1776, to the 28th of the same month, both days inclusive. The greatest\r\n  cold, during that period, was 15° and it is thus noted, in respect to\r\n  the state of the atmosphere at the time; “Clear sky—_intense\r\n  cold_—wind west.” The mercury rose on one day, within that time, to\r\n  34°. The _mean_ degree of cold, in the same period, was there 26¾°.\r\n\r\n  The greatest cold at Philadelphia, during the same days of January,\r\n  1776, was at 17°, but the mercury rose there, on one of those days, to\r\n  48°. The _mean_ degree of cold at Philadelphia, in this corresponding\r\n  period of time, was 29⅓°; being about 2½° warmer (or rather, less\r\n  cold,) than the general temperature of the weather in London, at the\r\n  same time, in what was there called a “severe frost.” Eighty-five\r\n  degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale is considered as a very extraordinary\r\n  heat, in London: consequently, a range of 68° may be presumed to reach\r\n  the extremes of heat and cold in England, in the latitude of nearly\r\n  52° N.[98a]\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the extremes of heat and cold, which thus appear in\r\n  the climate of Pennsylvania, Mr. Jefferson remarks (in his _Notes on\r\n  Virginia_,) that these extremes are greater at Paris than at\r\n  Williamsburg, the hottest part of Virginia. Yet Williamsburg, which is\r\n  only about 2¾° to the southward of Philadelphia, is nearly 11¾°\r\n  further south than Paris.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98a:\r\n\r\n  Since writing the above, the author has ascertained, that in London,\r\n  during the four last years of the last century, Six’s thermometer, out\r\n  of doors, averaged 49.6; that on the hottest day within that period,\r\n  the mercury rose to 86; and that it fell, on the coldest day, to 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  See a description of this Chronometer, in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe great accuracy and exquisite workmanship displayed in every thing\r\nbelonging to the profession he pursued, that came through his hands,\r\nsoon became pretty extensively known: and this knowledge of his\r\nmechanical abilities, assisted by the reputation he had already acquired\r\nas a mathematician and astronomer, in a short time procured him the\r\nfriendship, respect and patronage, of some eminent scientific\r\ncharacters; while it promoted his interest, in the profession he had\r\nthus newly chosen. In this he was, nevertheless, _self-taught_; for he\r\nnever received the least instruction from any person, in any mechanic\r\nart whatever: and, therefore, if he were to be considered as being\r\nmerely an excellent artist, in an occupation intimately connected with\r\nthe science of mathematics—_untutored_, as he was, in any art or\r\nscience,—he would deservedly be deemed an extraordinary and eminent man.\r\nIt will be perceived, however, that it was the _union_ of the almost\r\nunbounded powers of his genius, and his prodigious acquirements in a\r\nsublime science, with his wonderful abilities as a philosophical\r\nmechanic—and these faculties and attainments, moreover, combined with an\r\namiable and virtuous character,—which constituted that celebrity so\r\njustly attached to his name.\r\n\r\nOur young philosopher lived a retired, though by no means an inactive\r\nlife, in his father’s family, for several years after he arrived to\r\n(what is usually termed) lawful age. In this situation, which was a\r\npleasant one in many respects, he long continued to enjoy the tranquil\r\nscenes of rural life, amidst the society of an amiable and very\r\nintelligent family-circle, and surrounded by many worthy and estimable\r\nneighbours, by whom he was both loved and respected. His chief\r\noccupation was the profession he had chosen; but in such occasional\r\nintervals of personal abstraction from the mechanical part of his\r\nbusiness, as the assistance the workmen he employed enabled him to\r\nobtain, he devoted much of the time to philosophical pursuits and study.\r\nFrugal in his expenditures, his industry furnished him amply with the\r\nmeans of comfort; and in the plentiful and decent mansion of his\r\nfather’s family he experienced, with contentment, almost every\r\ngratification that a reasonable mind could desire. Good health seemed\r\nalone to be wanting to complete his happiness, in his earlier years; a\r\nprivation which he felt through the greater part of his life.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Mr. Rittenhouse, while he remained under the\r\nsame roof with his father and mother, and some of their unmarried\r\nchildren. It was a mode of life which his disposition was calculated to\r\nenjoy; for, strongly attached to his kindred and friends by the\r\nbenevolence of his nature, he derived much of his happiness from the\r\nreciprocal affections of a domestic circle and the kind intercourses of\r\nfriendly esteem.\r\n\r\nThere does not appear to have been, for a long time, any occurrence that\r\ncould have much disturbed the placid composure of our philosopher’s\r\nmind,—until 1762; in which year his sister Anne died, in the\r\ntwenty-sixth year of her age. She was the wife of Mr. George Shoemaker,\r\na respectable citizen of Philadelphia, and a member of the religious\r\nsociety of Friends. A letter which Mr. Rittenhouse wrote to his\r\nbrother-in-law Mr. Barton, in October 1762, announcing this event,\r\nindicates the keenness of his sensibility on the occasion. Mrs.\r\nShoemaker was a woman of intrinsic worth; she died in the prime of life;\r\nand it is believed, she was the first of Mr. Rittenhouse’s affectionate\r\nlittle band of brothers and sisters who had attained to the age of\r\nmaturity, that he had then lost. After giving a circumstantial account\r\nof his sister’s illness and death, he informs Mr. Barton, that Mr.\r\nDaniel Stanton, an eminent public speaker in the society of\r\nFriends,[100] attended her in her last illness, at her particular\r\nrequest;—and, added Mr. Rittenhouse, “the same worthy gentleman who\r\nvisited her in her sickness, delivered an excellent exhortation at the\r\ngrave,—giving, in a few words, a very just character, I think, of our\r\ndeceased sister.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Stanton died at Philadelphia, the 28th of June, 1770, aged\r\n  sixty-two years. He was, for above forty years, a distinguished\r\n  preacher among the people called Quakers; and is reputed to have been\r\n  a man, “who, from his youth, had been a conspicuous example of\r\n  Christian meekness, humility, and self-denial; a zealous promoter of\r\n  the cause of religion, and the essential good of mankind.”\r\n\r\n  Some elegiac verses, under the title of a “poetic tribute” to\r\n  the memory of this worthy man,—from the pen of a lady in\r\n  Philadelphia,—were published in the _Port Folio_, for April\r\n  1813.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMr. Shoemaker (who married again) had an only child named Jacob, by his\r\nfirst wife here mentioned. This son became a young man of promising\r\ncharacter: but, having entered the American army at the commencement of\r\nthe revolutionary war, and attained (it is believed) the rank of\r\ncaptain, under the patronage of his uncle David Rittenhouse, he was\r\nslain in the campaign of 1781, in South-Carolina. Mr. Rittenhouse was\r\nmuch afflicted by the death of this gallant young man, who fell in the\r\nflower of his age.\r\n\r\nAn occasion presented itself, in which Mr. Rittenhouse, when only in the\r\nthirty-second year of his age, was employed in transacting an important\r\npiece of business of a _public_ nature: it was as follows.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a petition of the Messrs. Penn to the court of\r\nchancery in England, exhibited in the year 1735, it was decreed by the\r\nlord chancellor, in 1750,—That an agreement which had been entered into\r\nbetween the Penns and Lord Baltimore, concerning the long-subsisting\r\ncontroversy relative to the boundary lines between Pennsylvania and\r\nMaryland, should be carried into specific execution: and, accordingly, a\r\nfinal agreement was executed by those proprietaries of the two\r\nprovinces, on the fourth day July, 1760.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the chancellor’s decree, provision was made for\r\nascertaining and fixing the “circle,” to be “drawn at twelve miles\r\ndistance from New-Castle, northward and westward, unto the beginning of\r\nthe fortieth degree of north latitude;”—and thence, running a straight\r\nline westward, five degrees in longitude, to be computed from the\r\neastern boundary; as described in the royal charter to William Penn.\r\nCommissioners were appointed under the chancery-degree, for settling\r\nthese boundaries. But nothing was definitively done in the business,\r\nuntil the eleventh of January, 1769; when the line which was run by\r\nMessrs. Mason and Dixon in the years 1767 and 1768, in pursuance of the\r\nfinal agreement between the parties before mentioned, was approved and\r\nratified by the king in council.\r\n\r\nSo early, however, as about the close of the year 1763, four or five\r\nyears before the running and marking of Mason and Dixon’s line, Mr.\r\nRittenhouse was employed by the Penn family in making some geographical\r\narrangements, preparatory to the final establishment of those\r\nboundaries. He was engaged to perform this service, by the Rev. Mr.\r\nRichard Peters, (afterwards D. D. and rector of the united churches of\r\nChrist-Church and St. Peters, in Philadelphia,) who then officiated as\r\nthe Governor’s provincial secretary; a gentleman of learning and great\r\nworth; and one who, on various occasions, manifested a friendship for\r\nMr. Rittenhouse, as well the high opinion he entertained of his\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nThe particular department of that business thus committed to Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, seems to have been the fixing of _the Circle_,—or at least,\r\nthe tracing of its course or route, topographically; and this was,\r\ncertainly, a matter of no little difficulty. That this service was\r\nperformed to the satisfaction of the then administrators of the\r\ngovernment of Pennsylvania, and that it was an arduous one, will appear\r\nby the following extract of a letter from Mr. Rittenhouse to the Rev.\r\nMr. Barton, dated the sixteenth of February, 1764.[101]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  This letter contains, likewise, a short narrative of an occurrence\r\n  which excited much feeling, and claimed a considerable portion of the\r\n  public attention, at the time. As Mr. Rittenhouse’s account of the\r\n  transaction referred to, will serve to shew that he was not an\r\n  indifferent spectator of the political events of that early day; and,\r\n  further, that he was zealously disposed to support the legitimate\r\n  authority of the government, in order to suppress illegal and\r\n  disorderly proceedings, subversive of the laws and dangerous to the\r\n  public peace and safety; this part of his letter to Mr. Barton (of the\r\n  16th of February, 1764,) is also presented to the reader.\r\n\r\n  It will be recollected that what was called the _Paxton Riot_ in\r\n  Pennsylvania, in the year 1763, was occasioned by an attempt made by\r\n  many of the inhabitants of a district in the upper end of Lancaster\r\n  (now Dauphin) county, called Paxton, with some of their neighbours, to\r\n  destroy a number of Indians resident in and near that county; who were\r\n  extremely obnoxious to the Paxton people, by reason of the supposed\r\n  treachery, if not actual hostility, of these Indians to the settlers\r\n  on the Paxton frontier, in the war that had then recently terminated.\r\n  These unfortunate Indians had, nevertheless, uniformly professed\r\n  themselves to be friendly to the English, in that war; and were so\r\n  reputed by the government of Pennsylvania: but finding themselves,\r\n  notwithstanding, threatened with extermination by “_the Paxton Boys_”\r\n  (as they were then called,)—by whom a few old men, women, and children\r\n  had been destroyed, shortly before, at their homes,—they sought the\r\n  protection of the government. Part of them were, accordingly, placed\r\n  in the public prison in Lancaster, and the remainder at the barracks\r\n  in Philadelphia, as places of security. Those in Lancaster, to the\r\n  number of fourteen or fifteen, were soon after, as is well known,\r\n  killed by the Paxton people, one of the prison doors having been\r\n  forcibly broken open by them. The remnant of these persecuted Indians,\r\n  who were in Philadelphia, were more fortunate than their brethren;\r\n  they escaped the horrors of assassination: And it is to the expedition\r\n  against these wretched fugitives—a mere handful of men, unarmed, and\r\n  claiming from Christians an asylum from massacre,—that Mr. Rittenhouse\r\n  refers in his letter.\r\n\r\n  “You are no doubt, long before this time, well acquainted,” said our\r\n  young philosopher, “with every particular of the Paxtonian expedition\r\n  to Philadelphia: nor need I tell you, that whatever information you\r\n  may have through the channel of ——, will be abominably corrupt. About\r\n  fifty of the scoundrels marched by my work-shop—I have seen hundreds\r\n  of Indians travelling the country, and can with truth affirm, that the\r\n  behaviour of these fellows was ten times more savage and brutal than\r\n  theirs. Frightening women, by running the muzzles of their guns\r\n  through windows, swearing and hallooing; attacking men without the\r\n  least provocation; dragging them by the hair to the ground, and\r\n  pretending to scalp them; shooting a number of dogs and fowls;—these\r\n  are some of their exploits.\r\n\r\n  “I received a letter from sister E. soon after the alarm at\r\n  Philadelphia was over, and will give you a part of it, which I doubt\r\n  not will be agreeable to you.”—It is as follows.\r\n\r\n  —“On Monday morning between one and two o’clock, an express came to\r\n  the governor, informing that the rebels were on their way, and that a\r\n  great number of them were on this side the White Horse. There was one\r\n  express after another, till there was certain intelligence that some\r\n  of them were at Germantown. When the first express came, the bells\r\n  were rung, the drums beat, and the constables were ordered to go from\r\n  house to house, to knock up the inhabitants, and to bid them put\r\n  candles at their doors: it had the appearance of all the houses being\r\n  illuminated. Before day, there were above twenty men met at J. J.’s,\r\n  and chose their officers. Before night they were increased to nearly\r\n  an hundred; as were likewise most of the other companies: E—— and all\r\n  our men were in captain Wood’s company. They all appeared to be in\r\n  high spirits, and desirous to meet the rebels. On Tuesday, when the\r\n  mayor and the other gentlemen set off for Germantown, the heads of the\r\n  companies begged of them not to comply with any dishonourable terms,\r\n  and told them—“Gentlemen, we are ready to go wherever you may command\r\n  us; and we had much rather you would let us treat with them (the\r\n  rebels) with our guns.”—On their return, there was a general murmur\r\n  among the companies against the proceedings of our great men; they\r\n  knew it, and there was a long harangue made by Mr. Chew: but it did\r\n  not answer the end. On Wednesday morning I went to —-—, as usual; and\r\n  on my return home, I stopped at our friend H. J.’s; when, on a sudden,\r\n  the alarm-gun was fired, the bells began to ring, and the men called\r\n  “_to arms_,” as loud as possible. I cannot describe, my dear brother,\r\n  how I felt: we ran to the door, when to add to my fright, I saw E——,\r\n  amidst hundreds of others, run by with his gun. They met at the\r\n  court-house, formed themselves into regular companies, and marched up\r\n  Second-street as far as the barracks; when they found it was a false\r\n  alarm.\r\n\r\n  “It was a pleasing, though melancholy sight, to view the activity of\r\n  our men. In less than a quarter of an hour, they were all on their\r\n  march,—it is supposed above a thousand of them; and by all accounts,\r\n  there were not ten —— among them. It was the common cry, while our men\r\n  were parading—“What! not one —— among us!”—Instead of joining with\r\n  others, they would sneak into corners, and applaud the “Paxton-boys.”\r\n  Their behaviour on this occasion has made them appear blacker than\r\n  ever.”\r\n\r\n  Concerning these extraordinary transactions, to which much importance\r\n  was attached in their day, and which, moreover, constitute a curious\r\n  and interesting occurrence in the history of Pennsylvania, in the time\r\n  of our philosopher, the testimony of another respectable witness is\r\n  added; a person, besides, who bore a principal part in arresting the\r\n  progress of the insurrection referred to. On the 2d of June, 1765, Dr.\r\n  Franklin, who was then in London, wrote a letter to the celebrated\r\n  Henry Home, lord Kames, in which the following interesting\r\n  circumstances are related, respecting what was called the Paxton\r\n  Expedition: this letter is inserted entire in lord Woolhousie’s\r\n  _Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Lord Kames_. The Doctor therein\r\n  says—“In December (1763,) we had two insurrections of the back\r\n  inhabitants of our province, by whom twenty poor Indians were\r\n  murdered, that had from the first settlement of the province lived\r\n  among us, under the protection of our government. This gave me a good\r\n  deal of employment; for, as the rioters threatened further mischief,\r\n  and their actions seemed to be approved by an increasing party, I\r\n  wrote a pamphlet, entitled _A Narrative_, &c. to strengthen the hands\r\n  of our weak government, by rendering the proceedings of the rioters\r\n  unpopular and odious. This had a good effect: and afterwards, when a\r\n  great body of them with arms marched towards the capital in defiance\r\n  of the government, with an avowed resolution to put to death one\r\n  hundred and forty Indian converts, then under its protection, I formed\r\n  an association at the governor’s request, for his and their defence,\r\n  we having no militia. Near one thousand of the citizens accordingly\r\n  took arms: Governor Penn made my house for some time his\r\n  head-quarters, and did every thing by my advice; so that, for about\r\n  forty-eight hours, I was a very great man, as I had been once some\r\n  years before, in a time of public danger. But the fighting face we put\r\n  on, and the reasonings we used with the insurgents, (for I went, at\r\n  the request of the governor and council, with three others, to meet\r\n  and discourse them,) having turned them back, and restored quiet to\r\n  the city, I became a less man than ever; for I had, by these\r\n  transactions, made myself many enemies among the populace.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said he, “you will never believe that I am determined to\r\ndisclaim all kind of intercourse” with you: for I can say with the\r\ngreatest sincerity there are very few things I so much regret, as that I\r\nhave it not in my power to spend a great part of my time with you. My\r\nattention has, for some time past, been engaged with such a multiplicity\r\nof things, that I may with some reason claim your indulgence for my not\r\nwriting. Have I not, indeed, an equal right to complain?—for, I think\r\nthis letter will balance our accounts, from the time I last saw you.\r\n\r\n“I waited on Mr. Peters, as you desired me to do. He treated me kindly,\r\nand made an offer of doing me some services; for which I am greatly\r\nobliged to him. He likewise paid me for my attendance at New-Castle, and\r\nmuch more generously than I expected;—though I found it a very laborious\r\naffair; being obliged, singly, to go through a number of tedious and\r\nintricate calculations.”\r\n\r\nIt appears that about this time, Mr. Rittenhouse’s friends had some\r\nbeneficial object in view for him; perhaps some official situation,\r\nwhich they conceived to be adapted to the nature of his pursuits, and\r\nsuch as might more permanently promote his interests. But whatever that\r\nobject may have been, he seems to have hesitated about it. If it were a\r\npublic appointment of a permanent kind, it would probably have required\r\nhis removal to the city,—a measure which he did not contemplate at that\r\ntime; and he might, besides, have been disinclined to undertake any\r\nofficial duties, which would be likely to occupy the greater part of his\r\ntime. He expressed himself thus to Mr. Barton, on the subject, in the\r\nletter just quoted:—“I am greatly obliged to you, my dear brother, for\r\npointing out any prospect of advantage to me: I shall consider the\r\nmatter you mention in your last, and let you know my opinion. The\r\nobjections you have so well answered, are those which would most readily\r\noccur to me. Considering the crazy state of my constitution, a retired\r\nlife would certainly suit me best. Since death, to use John\r\nBunyan’s[102] phrase, does usually knock at my door once a day, would it\r\nnot be a folly for me to take up the load of any public business?”\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  The writer of these memoirs well remembers to have heard Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse, when fully matured in years, speak of the pleasure he\r\n  derived from the reading of John Bunyan’s _Pilgrim’s Progress_, while\r\n  a youth. It is, certainly, no faint compliment to the “well-told tale”\r\n  of that “ingenious dreamer,” that it engaged the attention of David\r\n  Rittenhouse, even at a very early period of his life: and that\r\n  compliment is greatly enhanced by the following beautiful invocation,\r\n  addressed to the long-since departed spirit of the humble, yet\r\n  persecuted, the pious, yet fanciful Bunyan, by the amiable Cowper:—\r\n\r\n         “Oh thou, whom, borne on fancy’s eager wing,\r\n         Back to the season of life’s happy spring,\r\n         I pleas’d remember, and, while mem’ry yet\r\n         Holds fast her office here, can ne’er forget;\r\n         Ingenious dreamer, in whose well-told tale\r\n         Sweet fiction and sweet truth alike prevail;\r\n         Whose hum’rous vein, strong sense, and simple style;\r\n         Witty, and well-employ’d, and, like thy Lord,\r\n         Speaking in parables his slighted word;\r\n         I name thee not, lest so despis’d a name\r\n         Should move a sneer at thy deserved fame:\r\n         Yet, ev’n in transitory life’s late day,\r\n         That mingles all my brown with sober gray,\r\n         Revere the man, whose PILGRIM marks the road,\r\n         And guides the PROGRESS of the soul to God.”\r\n                                          Cowper’s _Tirocinium_.\r\n\r\n  The celebrated Benjamin Franklin too, in the account of his Life\r\n  written by himself, informs us, that the _Pilgrim’s Progress_ (which\r\n  Franklin there, inadvertently, calls “_Bunyan’s Voyages_,”) was a\r\n  favourite book of his, in his earlier years. “I have since learned,”\r\n  says the Doctor, “that it has been translated into almost all the\r\n  languages of Europe; and, next to the Bible, I am persuaded, it is one\r\n  of the books which has had the greatest spread.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAbout three years afterwards, Mr. Rittenhouse seemed to have been less\r\nindisposed to accept of an official situation: and, such was his high\r\nstanding with the government and its most influential friends, there can\r\nbe very little doubt he could have obtained a respectable one. It is\r\nevident that, at this latter period, when perhaps his health was\r\nimproved, he had some particular office in view: because, by a letter to\r\nMr. Barton, dated January 28th 1767, he said—“I am entirely satisfied\r\nwith your proceedings in the affair I recommended to you; and I shall\r\nwait on Mr. Peters. The reputation of the office would be very agreeable\r\nto me; but the execution of it would, I am afraid, greatly interfere\r\nwith the other projects you have so much insisted on.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse continued a bachelor until the 20th of February, 1766,\r\nwhen he married Eleanor Colston, daughter of Bernard Colston, a\r\nreputable farmer in the neighbourhood. This person belonged to the\r\nreligious society called Quakers; Mr. Rittenhouse was not himself a\r\nmember of any particular church: but the marriage was solemnized at\r\nNorriton, by the Rev. Mr. Barton, who went thither for the purpose at\r\nhis brother-in-law’s request.\r\n\r\nSome time prior to this event, old Mr. Rittenhouse, having previously\r\nmade his son David the proprietor of the Norriton farm, removed with his\r\nfamily to the house he had built[103] on his place in Worcester\r\ntownship, already mentioned; while the son’s family occupied the old\r\nplace of residence: and here our Astronomer remained about four years\r\nafter his marriage. It was during this period, that his reputation as an\r\nastronomer became eminently conspicuous;[104] his name acquired a\r\ncelebrity even in the old world, of which his early but now much\r\nincreased fame, in his native country, was a sure presage.[105]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  This was about the year 1764.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  In the earlier part of this interval of time, and before he became\r\n  more seriously engaged in those great works and researches, the\r\n  construction of his Orrery, and the Observation of the Transit of\r\n  Venus with the operations preparatory to it, which about that time\r\n  engrossed his attention, he occasionally amused himself with matters\r\n  rather speculative than practical: though he very seldom devoted any\r\n  considerable portion of his time to things which he did not consider\r\n  as being in some degree useful.\r\n\r\n  The following is one of those instances in which his active mind was\r\n  diverted from severer studies, to some objects of a more playful\r\n  nature.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1767, some ingenious country-gentleman published in\r\n  Messrs. Hall and Sellers’s paper, under the signature of T.T. the\r\n  result of calculations he had made on Archimedes’s famous vaunting\r\n  assertion, Δος που στω, και την γην κινησω. Mr. Rittenhouse published,\r\n  some short time after, calculations (or rather the result of\r\n  calculations) of his own, on the same problem. This appeared in a\r\n  piece under the signature of “_A Mechanic_,” dated the 8th of October,\r\n  1767: and a reply to it, by T. T. dated October the 29th, appeared in\r\n  the same paper. These little speculations will be found in the\r\n  Appendix. It is not improbable that Mr. Rittenhouse, under the\r\n  disguise of “A Mechanic,” appeared in print on this occasion, for the\r\n  purpose of drawing the attention of ingenious men to subjects of this\r\n  nature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  It was between the years 1766 and 1770—the interval of time above\r\n  mentioned,—that the two important circumstances occurred, which gave\r\n  great celebrity to the reputation of Mr. Rittenhouse, as an\r\n  astronomer: these were the Construction of the Orrery invented by him,\r\n  and the admirable result of his observations of the Transit of Venus,\r\n  as published in the Philosophical Society’s Transactions.\r\n\r\n  Amidst those objects of importance in which he was principally\r\n  occupied, he occasionally amused himself with matters of minor\r\n  consequence. Among other things, he contrived and made, in the\r\n  beginning of the year 1767, an ingeniously contrived thermometer,\r\n  constructed on the principle of the expansion and contraction of\r\n  metals, by heat and cold, respectively. This instrument had, under\r\n  glass, a face upon which was a graduated semi-circle: the degrees of\r\n  heat and cold corresponded with those of Fahrenheit’s thermometer; and\r\n  these were also correspondently designated, by an index, moving on the\r\n  centre of the arch. Its square (or rather parallelogramical) form, its\r\n  flatness and thinness, and its small size—together with its not being\r\n  liable to the least sensible injury or irregularity, from any position\r\n  in which it might be placed,—rendered it safely portable; insomuch,\r\n  that it could be conveniently carried in the pocket.\r\n\r\n  He presented one of these metaline Thermometers to Dr. Peters, in June\r\n  1767: Another, which he made for himself, was a considerable time in\r\n  the hands of Mr. Barton, at Lancaster. They were found to agree very\r\n  well with Fahrenheit’s. In a letter to Mr. Barton, dated the 26th of\r\n  July 1769, he said—“You will oblige me by sending the metaline\r\n  thermometer by..., and let me know the greatest height you have seen\r\n  it, this season, Fahrenheit’s thermometer, in my Observatory, not\r\n  exposed to the sunshine but very open to the air, was 94½° on the 5th\r\n  of this month, at 3 in the afternoon; which is the highest I have ever\r\n  seen it.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAbout the time that he projected his Orrery (which shall be duly noticed\r\nin its place), it appears he had been speculating on the doctrine of the\r\ncompressibility of water. For in a letter to Mr. Barton, dated from\r\nPhiladelphia the 27th of March, 1767, he mentions,—that he had not then\r\nmet with any person, who had seen Mr. Kinnersley’s[106] experiment on\r\nthat theory; but that he understood it was made with the air-pump, and\r\nconjectured it to have been similar to the one made by a member of the\r\nRoyal Society, related in Martin’s Magazine: which is thus quoted in Mr.\r\nRittenhouse’s letter:\r\n\r\n“I took a glass ball of about an inch and 6/10 in diameter, which was\r\njoined to a cylindrical tube of 4 inches and 2/10 in length, and in\r\ndiameter 1/100 of an inch; and by weighing the quantity of mercury\r\nthat exactly filled the ball, and also the quantity that filled the\r\ntube, I found that the mercury in 23/100 of an inch of the tube was\r\nthe 10000th part of that contained in the ball; and with the edge of a\r\nfile, I divided the tube accordingly. This having been done, I filled\r\nthe ball and part of the tube with water exhausted of air: Now, by\r\nplacing this ball and tube under the receiver of an air-pump, I could\r\nsee the degree of expansion of the water, answering to any degree of\r\nrarefaction of the air; and by putting it into a glass receiver of a\r\ncondensing engine, I could see the degree of compression of the water,\r\nanswering to any degree of condensation of the air, &c.”—Then adds.\r\nMr. Rittenhouse—“Indeed I do not doubt the compressibility of water,\r\nalthough the above experiment does not much please me. If the\r\nparticles of water were in actual contact, it would be difficult to\r\nconceive how any body could much exceed it in specific gravity; yet we\r\nfind that gold does, more than eighteen times.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Ebenezer Kinnersley, A. M. Professor of English and Oratory\r\n  in the college of Philadelphia. This venerable and worthy man, who was\r\n  a clergyman of the Baptist church, was a very eminent Electrician. In\r\n  this branch of philosophy, he was an able lecturer and ingenious\r\n  experimentalist: and perhaps to no person—at least in America,—were\r\n  his cotemporaries more indebted, than to him, for the light which he\r\n  shed, at a very early day, on this interesting and pleasing science.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe first academic honour conferred upon our philosopher, was on the\r\n17th of November, 1767; when the College of Philadelphia, then in its\r\nmeridian splendour, bestowed on him an honorary degree of Master of\r\nArts. Mr. Rittenhouse being present at the commencement then held, the\r\nprovost, in conferring this degree, thus addressed him,—in terms of a\r\njust and well merited compliment:\r\n\r\n“Sir,—The trustees of this College (the faculty of professors cheerfully\r\nconcurring), being ever desirous to distinguish real merit, especially\r\nin the natives of this province,—and well-assured of the extraordinary\r\nprogress and improvement which you have made, by a felicity of natural\r\ngenius, in mechanics, mathematics, astronomy, and other liberal arts and\r\nsciences, all which you have adorned by singular modesty and\r\nirreproachable morals,—have authorized and required me to admit you to\r\nthe honorary degree of Master of Arts, in this seminary: I de therefore,\r\nby virtue of this authority, most cheerfully admit, &c.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse’s great abilities, as an astronomer and mathematician,\r\nbeing now every where known, he was employed in the year 1769, in\r\nsettling the limits between the provinces of New-York and New-Jersey.\r\nThe original grant of all the territory, called by the Dutch\r\n_New-Netherlands_ (sometimes _Nova-Belgia_), was made by King Charles\r\nII. to James Duke of York, on the 12th of March, 1663-4; and on the 24th\r\nof June following, the Duke granted that part of it, now called\r\nNew-Jersey, to the Lord Berkeley of Stratton and Sir George Carteret,\r\njointly. The Dutch reduced the country, in the year 1672; but it was\r\nrestored by the peace of Westminster, February the 9th, 1673-4. On the\r\n29th of June, in the same year, a new patent was issued to the Duke of\r\nYork, for the lands comprised within the limits described in the former\r\npatent. On the 28th of the succeeding July, the colony of New-Jersey was\r\ndivided into East and West-Jersey (hence, generally called the Jersies);\r\nand the former was then granted, by the Duke of York, to Sir George\r\nCarteret. In 1675, West-Jersey, being Lord Berkeley’s moiety of the\r\nprovince, was sold to John Fenwick, in trust for Edward Bylinge; who\r\nassigned his interest therein to William Penn and others,[107] in trust,\r\nfor the use of his creditors. This partition was confirmed in the year\r\n1719, by the general assembly of the Jersies. But prior to this\r\nconfirmation, viz. the 10th of October, 1678, a new grant of West-Jersey\r\nwas made by the Duke of York, to the assigns of Lord Berkeley; and on\r\nthe 1st of February, 1681-2, East-Jersey was sold and conveyed, in\r\npursuance of Sir George Carteret’s will, to twelve persons; who, by\r\nseparate deeds, conveyed one-half of their several interests in the same\r\nto twelve other persons: and, on the 14th of the next month, the Duke of\r\nYork made a new grant of East-Jersey to those twenty-four proprietors,\r\nthereby confirming the same to them. The proprietors of both the Jersies\r\nafterwards became very numerous, by purchase as well as by descent. This\r\nbeing attended with great inconveniencies, they finally surrendered the\r\ngovernment to the crown, on the 17th of April, 1702: and from that time,\r\nthe province of New-Jersey continued to be a royal government, until the\r\nAmerican revolution.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  According to the American historian, Marshall, Lord Berkeley assigned\r\n  his interest in the Jersies to Penn and his three associates, in the\r\n  year 1674; and they, soon perceiving the inconvenience of a joint\r\n  property, divided the province, in 1676, with Carteret, who still\r\n  retained his interest: to him they released East-Jersey; and received\r\n  from him, in return, a conveyance for the western part of the\r\n  province. The Duke of York resigned the government of East Jersey to\r\n  the proprietor, retaining that of West-Jersey _as an appendage to\r\n  New-York_, until August 1680; when, on a reference to Sir William\r\n  Jones, the title was decided against the Duke: after which, he\r\n  formally released all claim upon East-Jersey. Soon after this,\r\n  Carteret transferred his rights to Penn, and eleven other persons of\r\n  the same religious persuasion, who immediately conveyed one half of\r\n  their interest to James Drummond, Earl of Perth, and eleven others;\r\n  and these, in March 1683, obtained a conveyance from the Duke of York\r\n  directly to themselves.—During these transactions, continual efforts\r\n  were made to re-annex the Jerseys to the province of New-York. [See\r\n  Marshall’s _Introduction to the Life of Washington_, ch. vi.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe division-line, between East and West-Jersey, was to run from the\r\nsouth-east point of Little Egg-Harbour, on Barnegate Creek—being about\r\nmidway between Cape-May and Sandy-Hook, to a creek, a little below\r\nAncocus-Creek, on the river Delaware; thence, about thirty-five miles in\r\na straight course, along the Delaware, up to 44° 40´ of north latitude.\r\n\r\nThe province of New-York passed a legislative act on this subject, in\r\nthe year 1762; and the New-Jersey Assembly enacted a corresponding law,\r\nin 1764. Five commissioners—namely, John Stevens, James Parker, Henry\r\nCuyler, William Donaldson, and Walter Rutherford—were appointed on this\r\nbusiness, for the two provinces: their report was passed upon, by both;\r\nand it was confirmed by the King in council, the 1st of September, 1773.\r\nIt is understood, that the division-line between East and West-Jersey\r\nremained unsettled, so late as the year 1789. But it nevertheless\r\nappears, that the territorial boundary between New-York and New-Jersey\r\nwas fixed by Mr. Rittenhouse, forty-four years ago.\r\n\r\nA recurrence shall now be had to a date anterior to our Philosopher’s\r\nemployment in the transaction just mentioned.—Within the two years\r\npreceding that period, two objects of much importance to astronomical\r\nscience, claimed a large share of the public attention, in this country:\r\nOne of them, especially, had already actually engaged the investigations\r\nof the ablest astronomers of the other hemisphere, as well as our own;\r\npreparatory to the then approaching event, to which those researches\r\nwere directed. The result of the expectations excited by both of those\r\nobjects proved, on their final completion, highly honourable to the fame\r\nof Mr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, in the order of time, was our Astronomer’s\r\nnewly-projected Orrery; a general but concise description of which, was\r\ncommunicated by his friend, the Rev. Dr. Smith, to the Philosophical\r\nSociety, on the 21st of March, 1768. Of this fine and eminently useful\r\npiece of mechanism, more particular mention shall be made in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe other circumstance, just referred to, was the then approaching\r\nTransit of Venus over the Sun’s disk; an event which was to take place\r\non the 3d day of June, 1769: And of Mr. Rittenhouse’s participation in\r\nthe arduous labours of the astronomical world, on that very interesting\r\noccasion, the following narrative will furnish some account.\r\n\r\nThe American Philosophical Society, in their meeting on the 7th of\r\nJanuary, 1769, had appointed the following gentlemen to observe that\r\n_rare phænomenon_,[108] as it was aptly styled by Dr. Smith; namely,\r\nthe. Rev. Mr. (afterwards Dr.) John Ewing, Mr. Thomas Prior, Joseph\r\nShippen, jun. Esq., Hugh Williamson, M. D., the Rev. Dr. Smith, Mr.\r\nDavid Rittenhouse, John Lukens, Esq. and Messrs. James Alexander, Owen\r\nBiddle, James Pearson, John Sellers, Charles Thomson, and William Poole.\r\nThe gentlemen thus nominated were distributed into three committees, for\r\nthe purpose of making separate observations at three several places;\r\nthese were, the city of Philadelphia, Mr. Rittenhouse’s residence, in\r\nNorriton, and the Light-House near Cape Henlopen, on Delaware Bay. Dr.\r\nEwing, an able mathematician and very respectable astronomer, had the\r\nprincipal direction of the Observatory in the City, which was erected on\r\nthis occasion in the State-house Gardens; and Mr. O. Biddle, a person of\r\nmuch ingenuity, had the charge of superintending the observations at\r\nCape Henlopen. Associated with Mr. Rittenhouse, on the Norriton\r\ncommittee, were the Rev. Dr. Smith, provost of the College of\r\nPhiladelphia, well known as an astronomer and eminently skilled in the\r\nmathematics; Mr. Lukens, then surveyor-general of Pennsylvania, who\r\npossessed considerable abilities in the same departments of science; and\r\nMr. Sellers, a respectable member of the provincial legislature, for the\r\ncounty of Chester. The Rev. Mr. Barton, with some other gentlemen of\r\ningenuity and talents, voluntarily attended at Norriton, on this\r\noccasion; and rendered such assistance as they could, to the committee.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  There will not be another transit of Venus over the Sun’s disk, until\r\n  the 8th of December, 1874; which, it is probable few persons now\r\n  living will have an opportunity of observing, astronomically: And from\r\n  that time, down to the 14th of June, A. D. 2984, inclusively,—a period\r\n  of upwards of eleven centuries,—the same planet will pass over the Sun\r\n  only eighteen times. There will be one other such transit of this\r\n  planet, within the present century; after which there will not be\r\n  another, during the term of one hundred and twenty-one years and an\r\n  half. [See Table of the Transits of Venus over the Sun, in Lalande’s\r\n  _Astronomie_; vol. ii.]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs the time approached near, when this extraordinary and almost\r\nunprecedented[109] astronomical phænomenon was to manifest itself, the\r\npublic expectation and anxiety, which were before considerable, became\r\ngreatly heightened. The ignorant—and those, generally, unacquainted with\r\nthe nature of the looked-for event,—hearing much every where said on the\r\nsubject, and seeing the preparations making for the occasion, had their\r\ncuriosity wonderfully excited. To scientific men, the inestimable value\r\nof the approaching phænomenon suggested very different sensations. “Its\r\nimportance to the interests of Astronomy and Navigation, had,” as Dr.\r\nEwing observed at the time, “justly drawn the attention of every\r\ncivilized nation in the world.” An accurate ascertainment of the Sun’s\r\nParallax,—an important. and fundamental article in Astronomy, was a\r\n_desideratum_ not yet obtained. Only two Transits of Venus over the Sun,\r\nhad been _observed_, prior to the 3d of June, 1769, since the creation\r\nof the world; and of these, the first alone was seen but by two\r\npersons:[110] Yet, as the learned gentleman just quoted has\r\nremarked,—“the Transits of Venus, alone, afford an opportunity of\r\ndetermining this problem” (the settling the Parallax of the Sun,) “with\r\nsufficient certainty: and these,” he adds, “happen so seldom, that there\r\ncannot be more than two in one century, and in some centuries none at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  There had been but one of these transits of Venus over the Sun, during\r\n  the course of about one hundred and thirty years preceding the transit\r\n  of 1769; and, for upwards of seven centuries, antecedently to the\r\n  commencement of that period, the same planet had passed over the Sun’s\r\n  disk no more than thirteen times. [See Lalande’s Table, before\r\n  referred to.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  Jeremiah Horrox and William Crabtree, two Englishmen, were the\r\n  observers of the Transit of Venus of 1639.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo an object, then, of such vast importance to science, were\r\nproportioned the expectations of our Observers. But they could not fail\r\nto experience, at the same time, in common with their astronomical\r\nbrethren in other parts of the world, a large portion of anxious\r\napprehensions, lest a cloudy day—nay, even a solitary passing\r\ncloud,—should baffle entirely their exalted hopes, and destroy all the\r\nfruits of their arduous labours! Yet such an occurrence, as one or the\r\nother of these events, was evidently within the calculations of a\r\nprobable incident.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse participated largely in these blended hopes and fears.\r\nHe had, for some time before, been laboriously employed in making the\r\nrequisite preparatory observations and calculations: and, as Norriton\r\nwas now rendered eminently conspicuous, by being fixed on as a principal\r\nsite for observing the very interesting phænomenon so near at hand, he\r\nhad been assiduously engaged, at the same time, in preparing and\r\nfurnishing an Observatory at that place, suitable for the occasion. This\r\nhe began to erect early in November, 1768,—“agreeably,” to use his own\r\nwords, “to the resolutions of the American Philosophical Society;” but,\r\nthrough various disappointments from workmen and weather, he was not\r\nenabled to complete it till the middle of April, 1769.[111]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  It was not until the year 1786, that Mr. Rittenhouse built the house\r\n  at the north-west corner of Arch and (Delaware) Seventh streets, in\r\n  Philadelphia, where he resided during the remainder of his life: but\r\n  probably it was some few years earlier that he erected his\r\n  Observatory, a small but pretty convenient octagonal building, of\r\n  brick, in the garden adjacent to his dwelling-house. Its situation was\r\n  not an ineligible one, when the building was first put up: but its\r\n  commodiousness and utility were probably much diminished, by the\r\n  erection, not long afterwards, of some large houses near it; and it is\r\n  presumable, that its usefulness in any degree, for the purposes of an\r\n  Observatory, could have continued but a little while beyond the\r\n  duration of its late proprietor’s life, by reason of the rapid\r\n  increase of the number of lofty houses in the vicinity. Indeed it\r\n  lately became extremely probable, on considering the great enlargement\r\n  of Philadelphia within the last twenty-five years, that the future\r\n  augmentation of the population and extension of improvements in this\r\n  beautiful and hitherto flourishing city, would, in a very few years,\r\n  render the late Observatory of Mr. Rittenhouse wholly useless for\r\n  astronomical purposes; and, in the event of the surrounding ground and\r\n  adjacent buildings being alienated from his family, improper for any\r\n  other.\r\n\r\n  This was the Observatory noticed by Mr. Lalande, when (in his\r\n  _Astronomie_, published in 1792,) he made this remark, treating of the\r\n  numerous Observatories in different parts of the world—“In America, I\r\n  know of no Observatory but that of Mr. Rittenhouse at Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\n  The Observatory at Norriton, mentioned in the text, was a temporary\r\n  erection; and was disused on his removal to Philadelphia, soon after.\r\n  The one put up in the State-House Gardens in that city on the same\r\n  occasion, was likewise a temporary edifice, constructed of wood.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Norriton Observatory was commodiously situated near Mr.\r\nRittenhouse’s mansion, on a pretty elevated piece of ground, commanding\r\na good range of horizontal view. This temporary edifice was as well\r\nadapted to the purpose for which it was chiefly designed, as the nature\r\nof the materials of which it was constructed, and other circumstances,\r\nwould permit. Some monies had been previously appropriated by the\r\nPhilosophical Society, towards defraying the expenses necessarily\r\nincident to this occasion, at the three several places of observation:\r\nbut the funds of the society, at their disposal for such purposes, were\r\nvery limited; and it is believed that the quota of these funds assigned\r\nfor the expenditures actually incurred for making the observations of\r\nthe transit, at Norriton, was quite inconsiderable in its amount.\r\n\r\nIn order that ample justice may be done to the merits of Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, for all the preparatory arrangements made by him on this\r\noccasion, the reader is here presented with an extract from Dr. Smith’s\r\nsubsequent Report, to the Philosophical Society, of the proceedings of\r\nthe Norriton Committee, and made in their behalf.—“I am persuaded” says\r\nthe doctor, “that the dependance which the learned world may place on\r\nany particular Transit-Account, will be in proportion to the previous\r\nand subsequent care, which is found to have been taken in a series of\r\naccurate and well conducted observations, for ascertaining the _going_\r\nof the time-pieces, and fixing the latitude and longitude of the place\r\nof observations, &c. And I am the more desirous to be particular in\r\nthese points, in order to do justice to Mr. RITTENHOUSE, one of the\r\ncommittee; to whose extraordinary skill and diligence is owing whatever\r\nadvantage may be derived, in these respects, to our observation of the\r\nTransit itself.”—“Our great discouragement at our first appointment,”\r\ncontinues the learned reporter, “was the want of proper apparatus,\r\nespecially good Telescopes with Micrometers. The generosity of our\r\nProvincial Assembly soon removed a great part of this discouragement,\r\nnot only by their vote to purchase one of the best reflecting\r\nTelescopes, with a _Dollond’s_ micrometer;[112] but likewise by their\r\nsubsequent donation of one hundred pounds,” (this was in sterling money,\r\n= $444) “for erecting Observatories and defraying other incidental\r\nexpences.[113] It was forseen, that on the arrival of the Telescope,\r\nadded to such private ones as might be procured in the city, together\r\nwith fitting up the instruments belonging to the honourable the\r\nProprietaries of the province—viz. the equal Altitude and Transit\r\nInstruments and the large astronomical Sector,—nothing would be wanted\r\nfor the city Observatory in the State-House Square, but a good\r\nTime-piece, which was easily to be procured. We remained, however, still\r\nat a loss, how to furnish the Norriton Observatory:[114] But even this\r\ndifficulty gradually vanished.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  On an address of the Philosophical Society to the general assembly,\r\n  dated the 15th of October, 1768, the latter “Resolved, That a sum, not\r\n  exceeding one hundred pounds sterling, be provided and appropriated\r\n  for purchasing a reflecting telescope with a micrometer, for the\r\n  purpose mentioned in the said address” (observing the Transit of\r\n  Venus, then near at hand,) “and, afterwards, for the use of the house;\r\n  and that the speaker do write to Benjamin Franklin, Esq. in London, to\r\n  purchase the same.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  On a similar address of the Philosophical Society, dated the 7th of\r\n  February, 1769, the assembly granted them one hundred pounds, “to be\r\n  laid out towards defraying the expenses necessary for observing the\r\n  (then) ensuing Transit of Venus.” This grant was made on the 11th of\r\n  February, 1769.\r\n\r\n  But the sum then granted proving very inadequate to the object, the\r\n  society petitioned the assembly on the 11th of February, 1773;\r\n  stating, that the erecting the different observatories, fitting up\r\n  instruments, engraving various plates, and publishing the different\r\n  transit papers alone, cost the society near 400_l._ and praying\r\n  assistance to discharge that debt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lalande, in the preface to his _Astronomie_ (3d edit. 1792,)\r\n  mentions, that he did not then know of any other observatory in\r\n  America than that of Mr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus it appears, that while the public contributions, and such\r\nastronomical instruments suitable for the occasion as were the\r\npublic property, were principally at the disposal of the\r\nPhiladelphia committee, the Observatory at Norriton—which seems to\r\nhave been considered as a private establishment, belonging to an\r\nindividual,—depended almost entirely on other resources. Even an\r\nexcellent reflecting telescope (though without a micrometer,) the\r\nproperty of the Library Company of Philadelphia, and to which\r\ninstitution it was a donation from the Hon. T. Penn,—the same that\r\nhad been used by Messrs. Macon and Dixon, when employed in settling\r\nthe boundary lines of Pennsylvania and Maryland—was necessarily\r\nappropriated to the use of Mr. Owen Biddle, who was appointed by the\r\nSociety to conduct the Observation of the Transit, near Cape\r\nHenlopen.\r\n\r\nThe Norriton Observatory was, notwithstanding, at last completely\r\nfurnished with every instrument proper for the occasion. In consequence\r\nof some previous communications made by Dr. Smith to the Hon. Mr. T.\r\nPenn of London, and to the Rev. Mr. Maskelyne, the British\r\nastronomer-royal at Greenwich, the former worthy and liberal gentleman\r\nhad sent, for the use of the Norriton committee, a reflecting Telescope\r\nwith Dollond’s Micrometer—such as the doctor had expressed a wish to\r\nobtain; and requested, that after the committee should have made their\r\nobservations with it, it should be presented in his name to the\r\nCollege.[115] Through the means of Dr. Smith, likewise, an astronomical\r\nquadrant of two and an half feet radius, made by Sisson, the property of\r\nthe East-Jersey proprietaries, was procured by Mr. Lukens from the Earl\r\nof Stirling, surveyor-general of that province. This had been pretty\r\nearly sent up by Mr. Lukens to Mr. Rittenhouse, and was used by him in\r\nascertaining the latitude of his Observatory.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  This was one instance among many of the munificence of Mr. Penn to the\r\n  College of Philadelphia, and of his zealous wish to promote the\r\n  interests of science in Pennsylvania. The trustees of the college say,\r\n  in a letter written to Mr. Penn the 1st of August, 1769, thanking him\r\n  for his donation of the fine instrument above mentioned, together with\r\n  a pair of “Adams’s new-invented Globes;” “We have likewise the\r\n  pleasure to acknowledge a fresh instance of your benevolence, in\r\n  sending us a chemical apparatus under the care of Dr. Rush.” “The many\r\n  great and valuable favours this College has received at your hands,\r\n  have always been conferred in a manner which has rendered them\r\n  peculiarly acceptable; and cannot fail to leave the most lasting\r\n  impressions of gratitude and esteem in the heart of every person\r\n  concerned in the institution.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn addition to these and some other apparatus used at Norriton on the\r\noccasion—a catalogue and description of the whole of which, are\r\ncontained in Dr. Smith’s before-mentioned report—the zeal, industry, and\r\ntalents of Mr. Rittenhouse enabled him to furnish his Observatory with\r\nthe three following described instruments, made by himself,[116] as\r\ndescribed by Dr. Smith.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lalande (in his _Astronomie_) has been careful to mention, that\r\n  the celebrated astronomer Hevelius possessed a similar merit. He\r\n  constructed, himself, the very large telescopes and other instruments,\r\n  described (with plates) in his great work entitled, _Machina\r\n  Cœlestis_, and with which he furnished the Observatory that he\r\n  established at his own residence, in the year 1641. Hevelius (whose\r\n  true name was John Hoelké.) was the son of a brewer; but was well\r\n  educated. He was born at Dantzic the 28th of January, 1611: and after\r\n  having made the tour of England, France and Germany, from 1630 to\r\n  1634, he was, on his return to his native city, occupied for some time\r\n  in the affairs of that little republic; of which he officiated as\r\n  consul, in 1651. He died on the anniversary of his birth-day, at the\r\n  age of seventy-six years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n1. An _Equal Altitude Instrument_—its telescope three and an half feet\r\nfocal length, with two horizontal hairs, and a vertical one in its\r\nfocus; firmly supported on a stone pedestal, and easily adjusted to a\r\nplummet-wire four feet in length, by two screws, one moving in a North\r\nand South, the other in an East and West direction.\r\n\r\n2. A _Transit Telescope_, fixed in the meridian, on fine steel points;\r\nso that the hair in its focus could move in no other direction than\r\nalong the meridian; in which were two marks, South and North, about 330\r\nyards distance each; to which it could be readily adjusted in an\r\nhorizontal position by one screw, as it could in a vertical position, by\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n3. An excellent _Time-piece_—having for its pendulum-rod a flat steel\r\nbar, with a bob weighing about twelve pounds, and vibrating in a small\r\narch. This went eight days, did not stop when wound up, beat dead\r\nseconds, and was kept in motion by a weight of five pounds.[117]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  For some of the reasons which induced the writer to describe the\r\n  instruments used on that occasion, see Note 125.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThus was the Norriton Observatory furnished with all the more\r\nimmediately necessary apparatus, in readiness for the important event\r\nwhich was the main object of these arduous exertions. Much credit was\r\ndue to Dr. Smith, much to Mr. Lukens and the other gentlemen engaged on\r\nthis occasion, for the assistance which he, and they, afforded Mr.\r\nRittenhouse. Yet the doctor himself very candidly says—in reporting the\r\nproceedings of the Norriton committee to the Philosophical\r\nSociety,—“other engagements did not permit Mr. Lukens or myself to pay\r\nmuch attention to the necessary preparations; but we knew that we had\r\nentrusted them to a gentleman on the spot, who had joined to a complete\r\nskill in _mechanics_, so extensive an _astronomical_ and _mathematical_\r\nknowledge, that the use, management, and even the construction of the\r\nnecessary apparatus, were perfectly familiar to him. Mr. Lukens and\r\nmyself could not set out for his house till Thursday, June 1st; but, on\r\nour arrival there, we found every preparation so forward, that we had\r\nlittle to do, but to adjust our respective telescopes to distinct\r\nvision. He had fitted up the different instruments, and made a great\r\nnumber of observations, to ascertain the going of his Time-piece, and to\r\ndetermine the latitude and longitude of his Observatory. The laudable\r\npains he hath taken in these material articles,” continues Dr. Smith in\r\nhis report, “will best appear from _the work itself_,—which he hath\r\ncommitted into my hands, with the following modest introduction; giving\r\nme a liberty, which his own accuracy, care and abilities, leave no room\r\nto exercise.”[118]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  In addition to this publicly declared testimony of Dr. Smith, to the\r\n  merits of Mr. Rittenhouse on that occasion, are the following extracts\r\n  of a letter from the Dr. to Mr. Barton, dated July the 8th, 1769.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Jesse Lukens left my house on Tuesday evening, at half an hour\r\n  past six, where he waited till I scrawled out a pretty long letter to\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse, for whom my esteem encreases the more I see him; and\r\n  I shall long for an opportunity of doing him justice for his elegant\r\n  preparations to observe the Transit, which left Mr. Lukens and me\r\n  nothing to do, but to sit down to our telescopes. This justice I have\r\n  already in part done him, in a long letter to the proprietor” (Thomas\r\n  Penn, Esq.) “yesterday, and I hope Mr. Rittenhouse will not deprive us\r\n  of the opportunity of doing it in a more public manner, in the account\r\n  we are to draw up next week.”\r\n\r\n  “I did not chuse to send Mr. Rittenhouse’s original projection of the\r\n  Transit, as it is a society paper, to be inserted in our minutes: but\r\n  I have enclosed an exact copy. Pray desire him to take the sun’s\r\n  diameter again carefully, and examine the micrometer by it. The mean\r\n  of our diameters come out, Hor. Diam. 31′ 34″, 3—Polar Diam. 31′ 32″,\r\n  8—Ven. Diam. 57, 98.—The Sun’s is bigger than the Naut. Almanac gives:\r\n  That of Venus very well. The diameters of the State-house micrometer\r\n  come out less. I have compared some of _our_” (the Norriton)\r\n  “micrometer-observations with those made in _town_, and do not find a\r\n  difference of one second: but _all_ theirs do not seem to have been\r\n  taken with equal care, and differ from each other sometimes; a fault I\r\n  do not find among ours. Our nearest distance of the centres comes out,\r\n  I think, 10′ 3″, in which we agree within about one second with their\r\n  nearest distance: and our time of the nearest approach of the centres,\r\n  viz. 5^h 20′ 32″, reduced to mean time, is within one minute of the\r\n  time marked for their nearest approach.”\r\n\r\n  “With my compliments to Mr. Rittenhouse and family, I am, in great\r\n  haste,” &c.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Barton was then at Norriton, and Dr. Smith wrote from\r\n  Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                                             _Norriton, July 18th 1769._\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n        “The enclosed is the best account I can give of _the Contacts_,\r\n  as I observed them; and of what I saw during the interval between\r\n  them. I should be glad you would contract them, and also the other\r\n  papers, into a smaller compass,—as I would have done myself, if I had\r\n  known how. I beg you would not copy any thing merely because I have\r\n  written it, but leave out what you think superfluous.—I am, with great\r\n  esteem and affection, yours, &c.\r\n\r\n                                                 DAVID RITTENHOUSE.[119]\r\n\r\n  TO REV. DR. SMITH.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  On the 26th of the same month he thus addressed Mr. Barton on the\r\n  subject:—\r\n\r\n  “I have at last done with astronomical observations and calculations\r\n  for the present, and sent copies of all my papers to Dr. Smith, who, I\r\n  presume, has drawn up a complete account of our Observations on the\r\n  Transit of Venus: this I hope you will see, when you come to\r\n  Philadelphia. I have delineated the Transit, according to our\r\n  observations, on a very large scale, made many calculations, and drawn\r\n  all the conclusions I thought proper to attempt, until some foreign\r\n  observations come to hand, to compare with ours; all of which have\r\n  been, or will be laid before the Philosophical Society. The Doctor has\r\n  constantly seemed so desirous of doing me justice, in the whole\r\n  affair, that I suppose I must not think of transmitting any separate\r\n  account to England.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe result of the Norriton Observations of the Transit of Venus—as well\r\nas those also made under the auspices of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety, at Philadelphia and Cape Henlopen—will be found, in detail, in\r\nthe first volume of the Transactions of that Society.[120] And “the Work\r\nitself,” to which Dr. Smith refers, in his Report of the Proceedings of\r\nthe Norriton Committee, bears ample testimony to the transcendent\r\nAstronomical Abilities of Mr. Rittenhouse.—Four days after the Transit,\r\nDr. Smith transmitted to the Hon. Mr. Penn, in London, a short account\r\nof the Norriton Observations, more particularly mentioning the times of\r\nthe Contacts, and a few other circumstances attending them. This was\r\nspeedily communicated by Mr. Penn to the Rev. Mr. Maskelyne,[121] the\r\nAstronomer Royal; who, acknowledging the receipt of the communication,\r\nby a note, dated at Greenwich the 2d of August, 1769, says—“I thank you\r\nfor the account of the Pennsylvania Observations (of the Transit,) which\r\nseem _excellent_ and _complete_,[122] and do honour to the gentlemen who\r\n_made_ them[123], and those who promoted the undertaking;— among whom, I\r\nreckon yourself[124] in the first place.”[125]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  The first volume of the Society’s Transactions contains (p. 125,)\r\n  among other observations of the transit of Venus in 1769, those made\r\n  at Baskenridge in New-Jersey, by the late Earl of Sterling. William\r\n  Alexander, the gentleman referred to, and who held this title, was (it\r\n  is believed) a native of New-York. It is presumable that the title he\r\n  bore was one to which he had an equitable right: It was recognized in\r\n  America, the country of his birth, from the time of his first\r\n  assumption of it until his death, although his claim to that honour\r\n  was not juridically established in Great Britain, where, in official\r\n  acts of that government, he was styled “William Alexander, Esq.\r\n  _claiming_ to be Earl of Sterling.” He was descended from Sir William\r\n  Alexander, in the reign of James I., to whom that monarch made a grant\r\n  of the province of Nova Scotia, on the 20th of September, 1621. On the\r\n  12th of July, 1625, Sir William obtained from King Charles I. a grant\r\n  of the soil, lordship and domains, of that province, which, with the\r\n  exception of “Port-Royal,” (Annapolis, on the Bay of Fundy,) formerly\r\n  the capital of the province, he conveyed on the 30th of April, 1630,\r\n  to Sir Claude de St. Etienne, lord of la Tour and Uarre, and to his\r\n  son Sir Charles de St. Etienne, lord of St. Deniscourt, on condition\r\n  that they should continue subjects to the crown of Scotland. This Sir\r\n  William was appointed by Charles I. commander in chief of Nova-Scotia.\r\n  Soon after the institution of the order of Baronets of Nova-Scotia, he\r\n  had been advanced to that dignity by Charles I. viz. on the 21st of\r\n  May, 1625; when the king conferred on him the privilege of coining\r\n  copper-money. In 1626, he was created Viscount Sterling: and on the\r\n  14th of June, 1633, he was further promoted by the same king to the\r\n  Earldom of Stirling.\r\n\r\n  The late Lord Stirling, who was seated at Baskenridge in New-Jersey,\r\n  inherited his Baronetage and titles of Nobility, as heir-male to\r\n  Henry, the fourth Earl. He married Sarah, daughter of Philip\r\n  Livingston, Esq. of New-York, by whom he had issue two daughters; Lady\r\n  Mary, married to —— Watts, Esq. of New-York, and Lady Catharine, first\r\n  married to William Duer, Esq. of New-York, and after his decease to\r\n  William Nelson, Esq. of the same city.\r\n\r\n  This nobleman appears to have been in some degree skilled in\r\n  astronomy, and was reputed a good observer. In the first volume of the\r\n  _Transactions of the American Philosophical Society_ there is\r\n  contained, besides his lordship’s observations of the transit of\r\n  Venus, a letter from him to Dr. Smith, communicating an account of his\r\n  having discovered, on the 28th of June, 1770, a comet, which he\r\n  observed astronomically on that and the three succeeding nights; being\r\n  the same that Mr. Rittenhouse first saw on the 25th of that month; and\r\n  respecting which, there are two letters from him to Dr. Smith, in the\r\n  same volume.\r\n\r\n  Immediately before the American revolution, lord Sterling was one of\r\n  the king’s council in New-Jersey; and held also, under the crown, the\r\n  appointment of surveyor-general for the eastern division of that\r\n  province. With the talents of a philosopher, he united those of the\r\n  soldier: On the 1st of March, 1776, his lordship was appointed a\r\n  brigadier-general in the continental army, and was afterwards promoted\r\n  to the rank of major-general. He was esteemed a brave and faithful\r\n  officer, and served with reputation; but he died before the close of\r\n  the war.\r\n\r\n  In the same volume of the _Transactions of the American Philosophical\r\n  Society_, with lord Stirling’s observations, there are, independent of\r\n  those made under the direction of that society, the observations of\r\n  the transit of Venus in 1769, made at Cambridge in New-England, by\r\n  John Winthrop, Esq. F. R. S. and member of the American Philosophical\r\n  Society, Hollisian Professor of Mathematics in Harvard-College—(see p.\r\n  124;) likewise, the result of those made by captain Holland and Mr.\r\n  St. Germain, at and near Quebec; and by other skilful observers, at\r\n  sundry places in Europe and the West-Indies; all reported (p. 120) by\r\n  a committee of the American Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards Dr. Maskelyne.—“To the abilities and indefatigable\r\n  attention of this celebrated astronomer,” says the Rev. Mr. Vince (in\r\n  his great work on astronomy,) “nautical astronomy is altogether\r\n  indebted for its present state of perfection. Of our (the English)\r\n  _Nautical Almanac_, that great astronomer, M. de la Lande, thus\r\n  writes: “On a fait á Bologne, á Vienne, á Berlin, á Milan; mais _Le\r\n  Nautical Almanac de Londres_, est l’ephemeride la plus parfaite qu’il\r\n  y ait jamais eu.” He has established the Newtonian doctrine of\r\n  universal attraction upon the firmest foundation, by his experiments\r\n  upon Schehallien.[121a] His regular observations of the sun, moon,\r\n  planets, and fixed stars, which are every year published, are allowed\r\n  to possess an unrivalled degree of accuracy; and we may consider them\r\n  as the basis of future improvements of the tables of the planetary\r\n  motions. M. de la Lande, in his _Astronomie_ (vol. ii. p. 121. last\r\n  edit.) speaking of astronomical observations, says—“Le recueil le plus\r\n  moderne et le plus précieux de tous est celui de M. Maskelyne,\r\n  Astronome Royal d’Angleterre, qui commence á 1765, et qui forme déja\r\n  deux volumes in folio jusqu’ á 1786. La precision de ces observations\r\n  est si grande, qu’on trouve souvent la même second pour l’ascension\r\n  droite d’une planete dédecite de différentes étoiles, quoiqu’on y\r\n  emploie la mesure du temps.”; His catalogue of fundamental stars is an\r\n  invaluable treasure. These, and his other various improvements in this\r\n  science, entitle him to the most distinguished rank amongst\r\n  astronomers, and will render his name illustrious, as long as the\r\n  science of astronomy shall continue to be cultivated.”\r\n\r\n  Of Lalande himself, whose name often occurs in the following pages,\r\n  Mr. Vince thus speaks:—“To that celebrated astronomer, M. de la Lande,\r\n  the world is indebted for the most important improvements in the\r\n  science of astronomy. Through so extensive a field, he has left no\r\n  track unbeaten; almost every part has received improvements from him.\r\n  His system of astronomy is invaluable, and has tended far more to the\r\n  general promotion of that science than all other works which ever\r\n  appeared upon the subject. The labours of this great astronomer will\r\n  perpetuate his name.” See Vince’s _Complete System of Astronomy_, vol.\r\n  ii. p. 288 and 289.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121a:\r\n\r\n  The Schehallien is a mountain in Scotland, being one of the highest\r\n  points in that range of mountains called the Grampian-Hills. The\r\n  elevation of the Schehallien above the surface of the sea is about\r\n  1760 feet. W. B.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Vince observes, in his _Complete System of Astronomy_, (vol. i. p.\r\n  419) that the Transit of Venus affords a very accurate method of\r\n  finding the place of the node; and this he verifies expressly by\r\n  calculations founded on the observations made by Mr. Rittenhouse at\r\n  Norriton, in the year 1769.\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  To so honourable a testimony, in favour of the merits of the\r\n  Pennsylvania observers of this Transit, as that of Mr. Maskelyne, the\r\n  acknowledgments of many other eminent foreign astronomers might be\r\n  superadded: And the Rev. Dr. Smith, addressing himself to the American\r\n  Philosophical Society, observes, “that societies of the first\r\n  reputation in Europe are not ashamed to place our labours on a footing\r\n  with their own; freely acknowledging, that we have been chiefly\r\n  instrumental in ascertaining that great desideratum in astronomy, the\r\n  sun’s parallax; and, consequently, the dimensions of the solar\r\n  system.” See his Oration, delivered before the society, Jan. 22, 1773.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  The compliment here paid by the Astronomer-Royal to the Hon. T. Penn,\r\n  proprietary of the late province of Pennsylvania, for the zeal he\r\n  manifested in _promoting_ the Pennsylvania Observations of the Transit\r\n  of Venus, was well merited,—as the detailed accounts of that highly\r\n  interesting phænomenon abundantly shew.\r\n\r\n  Nor was that the only instance in which Mr. Penn discovered his\r\n  attachment to the reputation and prosperity of that extensive American\r\n  territory, which continues to bear the name of his family. He was, on\r\n  various occasions, a liberal and disinterested benefactor to public\r\n  institutions in Pennsylvania: as a proof of which, his aggregated\r\n  donations to the College of Philadelphia, prior to the American war,\r\n  amounting to about twelve thousand dollars—besides a grant of the\r\n  manor of Perkessie in Bucks county, containing upwards of 3000\r\n  acres,—need alone be mentioned.\r\n\r\n  But it is within the knowledge of many persons in the midst of whom\r\n  these memoirs are penned, that even the Juliana Library Company, in\r\n  Lancaster (an inland and secondary town of Pennsylvania) experienced\r\n  repeated proofs of the munificence of Mr. Penn, and also of his late\r\n  truly noble and excellent consort, after whom that institution was\r\n  named. The writer himself, well knows, from the tenor of numerous\r\n  letters, not only from Mr. but Lady Juliana Penn, (who honoured the\r\n  Rev. Mr. Barton with their friendship and correspondence, for the\r\n  space of twenty years,—a patronage which was continued to a member of\r\n  his family, long after Mr. Penn’s death,) the generous and unremitted\r\n  attention of both, to whatever seemed likely to promote the honour or\r\n  the interest of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Penn, Esq. died on the 21st of March, 1775, when he had just\r\n  completed the seventy-fourth year of his age. He was the survivor of\r\n  all the children of the illustrious founder of Pennsylvania; “whose\r\n  virtues, as well as abilities, he inherited in an eminent degree,”—as\r\n  was justly observed in an obituary notice published soon after his\r\n  decease. Lady Juliana, his widow, survived him many years.\r\n\r\n  In the Pennsylvania Gazette (then published by Messrs. Hall and\r\n  Sellers, but originally by _Franklin_ and Hall,) for May 17, 1775,\r\n  appeared the following just tribute to the memory of Mr. Penn.\r\n\r\n  “He had the principal direction of the affairs of this government for\r\n  half a century, and saw such an increase of population, arts, and\r\n  improvements in it, as during the like period, perhaps no man, before\r\n  him, ever beheld in a country of his own. He rejoiced at the sight,\r\n  was a kind landlord, and gave a liberal, often a magnificent\r\n  encouragement, to our various public institutions. The Hospital, the\r\n  College, our different Libraries and Religious Societies, can witness\r\n  the truth of this: For he did not confine himself to sect or party;\r\n  but, as became his station, and the genius of his father’s benevolent\r\n  policy, he professed himself a friend to universal liberty, and\r\n  extended his bounty to all. In short, as the grave, which generally\r\n  stops the tongue of flattery, should open the mouth of Justice, we may\r\n  be permitted to conclude his character by saying,—that he was both a\r\n  great and a good man.”\r\n\r\n  The writer of these Memoirs hopes he will not be censured by any\r\n  Pennsylvanian of generous feelings, for introducing, in the Appendix,\r\n  some elegiac verses (by an unknown hand,) in commemoration of the\r\n  virtues of this worthy man; who was not only a munificent benefactor\r\n  to this country, and a bountiful patron of the Memorialist himself, as\r\n  well as his family; but who, also, took a very friendly interest in\r\n  the reputation and prosperity of Mr. Rittenhouse. These verses were\r\n  published in _The Pennsylvania Magazine_, for Oct. 1775.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  In addition to the honourable testimony of the Astronomer-Royal, in\r\n  favour of the Pennsylvania Observers of the Transit of Venus, is the\r\n  following eulogy of another eminent English astronomer,—as\r\n  communicated by Dr. Franklin to Dr. T. Bond, one of the\r\n  Vice-Presidents of the Philosophical Society, in a letter from London\r\n  dated the 5th of Feb. 1772. The Rev. Mr. Ludlam, the gentleman\r\n  referred to, and whom Dr. Franklin styles “a most learned man and\r\n  ingenious mechanic”—in a paper published in the Gentleman’s Magazine\r\n  (and a copy of which, subscribed by himself, was sent by him to the\r\n  Society,) giving an account of the Society’s Transactions, more\r\n  especially their Observations of the Transit of Venus,—applauds both\r\n  the General Assembly and the late Proprietaries of Pennsylvania, for\r\n  the countenance and assistance they gave to the making those\r\n  Observations.——“No astronomers,” said Mr. Ludlam, “could better\r\n  deserve all possible encouragement; whether we consider their care and\r\n  diligence in making the Observations, their fidelity in relating what\r\n  was done, or the clearness and accuracy of their reasonings on this\r\n  curious and difficult subject.” He then mentions, in very honourable\r\n  terms, the papers of Mr. Rittenhouse, Dr. Smith, Dr. Ewing, and Mr.\r\n  Biddle, who drew up the several accounts of the Observations made at\r\n  Norriton, Philadelphia, and Cape-Henlopen; and adds, that “they have\r\n  very honestly given not only the Result of their Observations, but the\r\n  _Materials_ also, that others may examine and judge for themselves; an\r\n  example worthy of imitation by those European astronomers, who are so\r\n  very shy of giving particulars, and vouch for their _Instruments_ and\r\n  Observations in general terms.”\r\n\r\n  The same gentleman, in a letter dated at Leicester (in England,)\r\n  January the 25th, 1772, and transmitted to the Philosophical Society\r\n  by Dr. Franklin, wrote thus:—“The more I read the Transactions of your\r\n  Society, the more I honour and esteem the members of it. _There is not\r\n  another Society in the world, that can boast of a member such as_ Mr.\r\n  RITTENHOUSE: theorist enough to encounter the problems of determining\r\n  (from a few Observations) the Orbit of a Comit; and also mechanic\r\n  enough to make, with his own hands, an Equal-Altitude Instrument, a\r\n  Transit-Telescope, and a Time-piece. I wish I was near enough to see\r\n  his mechanical apparatus. I find he is engaged in making a curious\r\n  Orrery. May I ask,” &c.\r\n\r\n  As further evidence of the high estimation in which the Transactions\r\n  of the American Philosophical Society, and particularly of the\r\n  Observers of the Transit, were held abroad, Dr. Wrangel, an eminent\r\n  and learned Swedish clergyman, wrote thus to Dr. Smith from Stockholm,\r\n  under the date of Oct. 18, 1771:—“I have been agreeably surprised to\r\n  observe the rapid progress of your American Society, of which I esteem\r\n  it a great honour to be counted a member,” &c.—“Your accurate\r\n  Observations of the Transit of Venus have given infinite satisfaction\r\n  to our (Swedish) astronomers; as will the rest of your Transactions,\r\n  to the literary world, when they come to be further known.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHere the observation will emphatically apply;—Laus est, â viro laudato\r\nlaudari.\r\n\r\nBefore this interesting occurrence in the life of Mr. Rittenhouse is\r\nfinally passed over, the reader’s attention is solicited to the\r\nbeautiful and animated description given by Dr. Rush, in his Eulogium,\r\nof the sensations which must have been more particularly experienced by\r\nthat extraordinary man, on the near approach of the long-expected\r\nPhænomenon.—“We are naturally led here,” says the learned Professor, “to\r\ntake a view of our Philosopher, with his associates, in their\r\npreparations to observe a phænomenon which had never been seen but\r\ntwice[126] before, by any inhabitant of our earth, which would never be\r\nseen again by any person then living, and on which depended very\r\nimportant astronomical consequences. The night before the long-expected\r\nday, was probably passed in a degree of solicitude which precluded\r\nsleep. How great must have been their joy, when they beheld the morning\r\nsun!—‘and the whole horizon without a cloud;’ for such is the\r\ndescription of the day, given by Mr. Rittenhouse, in the report referred\r\nto by Dr. Smith. In pensive silence and trembling anxiety, they waited\r\nfor the predicted moment of observation: it came,—and brought with it\r\nall that had been wished for, and expected, by those who saw it.—In our\r\nPhilosopher, it excited—in the instant of one of the contacts of the\r\nplanet with the sun, an emotion of delight so exquisite and powerful, as\r\nto induce fainting. This,” then remarks Dr. Rush, “will readily be\r\nbelieved by those who have known the extent of that pleasure which\r\nattends the discovery, or first perception of Truth.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  According to Mr. Lalande, (in his _Astronomie_, vol. ii.) the transit\r\n  of Venus over the Sun, in 1639, observed by only Messrs. Horrox and\r\n  Crabtree, two Englishmen, and which was the first ever observed, was\r\n  seen in consequence of a fortunate accidental circumstance. He says,\r\n  that Horrox had been occupied in making calculations for an almanack,\r\n  from the Tables of Lansbergius, which are much less perfect than the\r\n  Rudolphine Tables: that these Tables of Lansbergius were in an error\r\n  of 16′ for the latitude of Venus, while the Rudolphine Tables had an\r\n  error of only 8′; but the one of Lansbergius made Venus pass on the\r\n  sun in such a way, as that the transit ought to be visible; whereas\r\n  the tables of Kepler represented the planet as passing below him; and\r\n  thus it was, remarks Lalande, that bad tables occasioned a good\r\n  observation. Relying on these tables, which Lansbergius had extolled\r\n  with a confidence likely to produce imposition, Horrox prepared\r\n  himself to observe that transit; and on the 24th of November, it took\r\n  place at the time he expected, Venus being about half an hour on the\r\n  sun when he set. He had sent on the occasion to his friend Crabtree,\r\n  who was at Manchester, some miles from Hoole: and he observed the\r\n  transit, likewise; though very imperfectly, by reason of intervening\r\n  clouds. W. B.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of November, following, there was a Transit of Mercury over\r\nthe Sun. An account of this phænomenon,—as observed at Norriton by\r\nWilliam Smith, d. d. John Lukens, Esq. and Messrs. David Rittenhouse and\r\nOwen Biddle, the Committee appointed for that Observation by the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society,—was drawn up and communicated to the\r\nSociety, by direction and in behalf of the Committee, by Dr. Smith: this\r\nwill be found in the first volume of the Society’s Transactions. In this\r\nreport it is remarked, that—“the first time that ever Mercury was\r\nobserved on the Sun’s disk, was by Gassendus at Paris, October 28th\r\n1631, O. S. and that the Transit of Nov. 9th was the fourth in that\r\nclass; the two intermediate ones, each at forty-six years distance,\r\nhaving been observed by Dr. Halley, in 1677 and 1723.”\r\n\r\nMr. Maskelyne, the celebrated English Astronomer before\r\nmentioned,[127]—in a letter to Dr. Smith, of the 26th of December,\r\n1769—expressed a wish “that the difference of Meridians of Norriton\r\nand Philadelphia, could be determined by some measures and bearings,\r\nwithin one-fiftieth or one-hundredth part of the whole; in order to\r\nconnect,” continues Mr. Maskelyne, “your observations of the Longitude\r\nof _Norriton_ with those made by Messrs. Mason and Dixon, in the\r\ncourse of measuring the degree of Latitude.”—This request of the\r\nAstronomer Royal was communicated to the Philosophical Society of\r\nPhiladelphia; in consequence of which, Dr. Smith, Mr. Lukens and Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, were appointed to make the terrestrial measurement\r\nrequired. These gentlemen, having taken to their assistance Mr.\r\nArchibald M’Clean and Mr. Jesse Lukens, two able and experienced\r\nSurveyors, commenced their operations at Norriton, early on the 2d day\r\nof July following, and completed their survey on the 4th day of that\r\nmonth. The Report of the able Committee, to which this business was\r\nassigned by the American Philosophical Society, is also contained in\r\nthe first volume of the Transactions of that learned Body. After\r\ngiving various calculations, resulting from the operations of that\r\ncommittee, the Reporter says—“Hence, by the above measurement and\r\nwork, we get Norriton Observatory 52″ of time West of the Observatory\r\nin the State-house Square; which is exactly what we got by that\r\nexcellent element, the external contact of Mercury with the Sun, Nov.\r\n9th 1769.”—“The external contact,” continues the Reporter, “gave it\r\nsomething more; owing, no doubt, to the difference that will arise\r\namong Observers, in determining the exact moment when the thread of\r\nlight is compleated: and the mean of all our Observations gives the\r\ndifference of Meridians, between Norriton and Philadelphia, only 4″ of\r\ntime more than the terrestrial measurement, and the external contact\r\nof Mercury, gave it,—which may be taken as a very great degree of\r\nexactness; if we consider that the difference of Meridians, between\r\nthe long-established Observatories of Greenwich and Paris, (as Mr. De\r\nla Lande writes, Nov. 18th 1762,) was not then determined within 20″\r\nof time—For, he says, ‘some called it 9′ 15″; others, 9′ 40″;’ but\r\nthat he himself commonly used 9′ 20″, though he could not tell from\r\nwhat Observations it was deduced.[128]—Finally, the Report fixes\r\nPhiladelphia to be 5^h 0′ 37″, and Norriton, 5^h 1′ 29″ West from\r\nGreenwich.[129] The Latitude of Norriton, as deduced from the actual\r\nmensuration just mentioned, connected with Observations previously\r\nmade by Mr. Rittenhouse—predicated also, in part, on antecedent\r\nCalculations of Messrs. Mason and Dixon, who, (having been furnished\r\nwith a complete Astronomical Sector,) had ascertained the southernmost\r\npoint of the City of Philadelphia to be in Latitude 39° 56′ 29″,4.\r\nN.—is stated, in the same Report, as being 40° 9′ 31″. It came out, by\r\nthe measurement, 25″.09 less North, with respect to the southernmost\r\npoint of Philadelphia, than Mr. Rittenhouse’s Observations had given\r\nit; and, in making these, he had no better Instrument than Sisson’s\r\ntwo-and-an half feet Quadrant. Nevertheless, the framer of the Report\r\nremarks, “as both were fixed by celestial observations and experienced\r\nMen, the small difference ought perhaps to be divided; and if a mean\r\nbe taken, to reconcile it with the terrestrial measure, the Lat. of\r\nthe south point of Philadelphia would be 39° 56′ 42″; and that of\r\nNorriton, 40° 9′ 43″.[130]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  Flamsted, Halley, Bradley and Bliss, successively occupied the royal\r\n  observatory at Greenwich, from the time of its institution by Charles\r\n  II.; and, in the year 1765, the last of these eminent men was\r\n  succeeded in the place of Astronomer-Royal, by Nevil Maskelyne, B. D.\r\n  a man who, in the words of the profound French astronomer, Lalande,\r\n  “has sustained perfectly the reputation of that famous observatory.”\r\n\r\n  The scientific world are indebted to this excellent practical\r\n  astronomer for the publication of the Nautical Almanack; and, in a\r\n  great measure, for the perfection of the lunar method of ascertaining\r\n  the longitude at sea. “His unwearied exertions in this great cause of\r\n  humanity and science,” as the compilers of the _New Edinburgh\r\n  Encyclopedia_ (in the article _Astronomy_) observe, “entitle him to\r\n  the gratitude of the remotest posterity.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  It appears that the difference of the meridians of the Greenwich and\r\n  Paris Observatories, is 9′ 20″ as assumed by Lalande. This was\r\n  ascertained by the result of the measurement of the distance between\r\n  those Observatories, made sometime about the year 1786 or 1787, under\r\n  the sanction of the British and French governments, respectively; and\r\n  this difference of meridians corresponds with what Dr. Maskelyne had\r\n  before stated it to be. The last mentioned astronomer shewed, in 1787,\r\n  that the latitude of Greenwich is 51° 28′ 40″.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  In relation to Paris, Mr. Lalande calculates the longitude of\r\n  Philadelphia at 5^h 9′ 56″, according to Mr. Rittenhouse; and its\r\n  latitude, as being 39° 5′7 10.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  In Mr. Rittenhouse’s “Delineation of the Transit,” &c. published in\r\n  the first volume of the Philosophical Society’s Transactions, it\r\n  appears that he assumed the latitude of the Norriton Observatory to be\r\n  40° 9′ 56″.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same Volume of the American Philosophical Transactions that\r\ncomprehends the communications of these Proceedings—as well as various\r\nObservations, made at different places, on the then recent Transit of\r\nVenus—contains also a Memoir, by Dr. Smith, deducing the Sun’s Parallax\r\nfrom a comparison of the Norriton and some other American Observations\r\nof the Transit of Venus, in 1769, with the Greenwich and some other\r\nEuropean Observations of the same: And with this paper, its learned\r\nwriter has incorporated a communication, on the same subject, made to\r\nhim by Mr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nUntil about the period at which the latest of these favourite\r\ntransactions of Mr. Rittenhouse took place—namely, his geometrical\r\nemployment in ascertaining the Latitude and Longitude of Norriton and\r\nPhiladelphia, respectively,—he continued to reside on his farm at\r\nNorriton. And here he still carried on, with the aid of some apprentices\r\nand journey-men, his self-acquired occupation of a Clock and\r\nMathematical Instrument-maker: combining, at intervals, with these\r\nmechanical pursuits, an unceasing attention to his philosophical studies\r\nand researches; and occasionally employing himself, principally with a\r\nview to his health, in some of the occupations of Husbandry. Ever an\r\neconomist of Time, of which he well knew the inestimable value, none of\r\nhis hours which could be spared from necessary sleep were suffered to be\r\nunemployed. In this rural abode, he enjoyed the comforts of domestic\r\nlife amidst his little family, consisting only of an amiable wife and\r\ntwo young children. In short, no part of his time was unengaged, or\r\nuselessly passed; although he, not unfrequently, felt the solace of\r\nfriendly calls, and was gratified by visits from persons of science,\r\nworth, and distinction.\r\n\r\nThe writer of these memoirs designed to narrate those circumstances most\r\nworthy of notice, in the Life and character of Mr. Rittenhouse, in their\r\nchronological order; and this plan will be generally adhered to. Having\r\nfollowed our philosopher in his astronomical and mechanical pursuits, up\r\nto the year 1770, it therefore becomes proper to recur to a period of\r\nhis life some few years earlier, in order to introduce the history of\r\nhis Orrery,[131] before mentioned; a piece of mechanism which is\r\nadmitted, by all competent judges of its merit, to be one of the\r\ngreatest of his works.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  See Martin’s _Philosophia Britannica_, lect. xi. note 141. Though\r\n  “_Orrery_” be a modern name, the invention of such machines as it is\r\n  now applied to, is of a very early date. The first _planetarium_ or\r\n  _orrery_, of which we have any account, was the famous machine of\r\n  Archimedes. This consisted, as Cicero (in his _Tusculan Questions_)\r\n  asserts, of a sphere, of an hollow globular surface, of glass, within\r\n  which was some ingenious mechanism, to exhibit the motions of the\r\n  moon, the sun, and all the planets then known. Very imperfect as it\r\n  must necessarily have been in other respects, it was radically\r\n  erroneous, in being adapted to the _Ptolomaic_ system. This is\r\n  described in Latin verse, by the poet Claudius Claudianus, of\r\n  Alexandria, who flourished about four centuries after the Christian\r\n  era, and more than six centuries after the Syracusean philosopher.\r\n\r\n  Cicero, in his book _De Naturâ Deorum_, mentions one invented by\r\n  Posidonius the Stoic, in his time, and about eighty years before the\r\n  birth of Christ. He describes it as a “sphere,”—“in every revolution\r\n  of which, the motions of the sun, moon, and five planets were the same\r\n  as in the heavens, each day and night.”\r\n\r\n  Nothing further is heard of orreries or spheres, until about five\r\n  hundred and ten years after Christ, when Anicius Manlius Torquatus\r\n  Severinus Bœthius, the Roman Consul, (who was also a Christian, and a\r\n  Peripatetic Philosopher,) is said to have contrived one. Theodoric,\r\n  king of the Goths, calls it “_Machinam Mundo gravidam, Cœlum\r\n  gestabile, Rerum Compendium_”: But Bœthius was, nevertheless, put to\r\n  death by this Gothic king, A. D. 524. A long and dismal reign of\r\n  barbarism and ignorance having succeeded this period, no further\r\n  mention is made of any thing in the nature of a planetarium, for about\r\n  one thousand years. See Note 95.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Planetarium invented by Mr. George Graham,[132]—and a model of which\r\nwas improperly retained by Mr. Rowley, its constructor,—had, long before\r\nthe appearance of Mr. Rittenhouse’s machine, acquired the name of an\r\nOrrery; in compliment to Richard Boyle, Earl of Orrery,[133] who merely\r\npatronized the construction of one, from the artist Rowley’s pirated\r\nmodel. This complimentary appellation of Mr. Graham’s then newly\r\ninvented Planetarium is said to have been bestowed upon it by Lord\r\nOrrery’s friend, Sir Richard Steele:[134] and, the name being thus\r\napplied to _that_ machine, all those of the nature of _Planetaria_,\r\nsubsequently constructed,—however variant in usefulness or design, from\r\nthe original one bearing the name of an “Orrery,”—were denominated\r\n_Orreries_.[135] In compliance, then, with long established usage, Mr.\r\nRittenhouse modestly called his Planetarian-machine, from the first\r\nprojection of it, an Orrery; although the entire merit, both of the\r\ninvention and construction, belonged to himself.[136]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  In the work, entitled, “A new and general Biographical Dictionary,”\r\n  &c. published in 1761, the _Invention_ of _Graham’s_ Planetarium is\r\n  attributed to the celebrated Charles Boyle, Earl of Orrery; and the\r\n  compilers of that work cite this _supposed_ Invention of Lord\r\n  _Orrery_, “as an indubitable proof of his mechanical genius.” On this\r\n  authority, the compilers of the British Encyclopædia (reprinted in\r\n  Philadelphia by Mr. Dobson,) in the very words of the Biographical\r\n  Dictionary, make the nobleman from whom the first English Orrery\r\n  derives its name, the Inventor. But it seems to be now pretty\r\n  generally admitted, that his lordship was only the Patron of the\r\n  machine, made for George I. by Mr. Rowley.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  This accomplished nobleman, who was also the fourth Earl of Cork, in\r\n  Ireland, and the third Earl of Burlington, in England, was born in the\r\n  year 1695, and died in 1753. He was a great encourager of the liberal\r\n  arts, possessed an extraordinary taste and skill in architecture, and\r\n  was animated by a most exalted public spirit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Martin (in his _Philosophia Britannica_) says: “The Orrery, though\r\n  a modern name, has somewhat of obscurity in respect to its origin;\r\n  some persons deriving it from a Greek word, which imports to _see_ or\r\n  _view_:” “But others say, that Sir Richard Steele first gave this name\r\n  to an instrument of this sort, which was made by Mr. Rowley for the\r\n  late Earl of Orrery, and shewed only the movement of one or two of the\r\n  heavenly bodies. From hence many people have imagined, that this\r\n  machine owed its invention to that noble lord.” This Orrery was a\r\n  large one; and, although it is represented by Mr. Martin as a very\r\n  defective machine, it was purchased by King George I. at the price of\r\n  one thousand guineas.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Besides the Orrery here referred to, as the invention of the\r\n  celebrated mechanic and watchmaker, Mr. George Graham, a like machine\r\n  was afterwards contrived by Mr. James Ferguson, an eminent Scotch\r\n  mechanic and astronomer, and another planetarium of the same kind, by\r\n  Mr. William Jones, an ingenious mathematical instrument maker, of\r\n  London. From the planetarium or orrery of Graham, however, as a model,\r\n  all the modern orreries, prior to Mr. Rittenhouse’s, appear to have\r\n  been taken. The one constructed by Mr. Rowley is said to be very\r\n  similar to that invented by Dr. Stephen Hales.\r\n\r\n  But the idea of a planetarium, somewhat similar to the\r\n  Rittenhouse-orrery, seems to have been conceived by Huygens, who died\r\n  in 1695. A collection of this celebrated philosopher’s works was\r\n  printed at Leyden in the year 1724 and 1728: and in these will be\r\n  found the description of a planetarium; “a machine” (says Lalande, in\r\n  speaking of the one contemplated by Huygens,) “which represents, by\r\n  wheel-work, the revolutions of the planets around the sun and of the\r\n  moon around the earth, in their durations and natural dimensions; with\r\n  their excentricities, their inequalities, and their inclinations\r\n  towards the ecliptic.” See Lalande’s _Astron._\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Jefferson remarks, in his _Notes on Virginia_, that “Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse’s model of the planetary system has the plagiary\r\n  appellation of an Orrery.” This was, undoubtedly, a plagiary name, in\r\n  its relation to Graham’s Planetarium, of which Lord Orrery was the\r\n  supposed inventor: but the charge of plagiarism does not properly\r\n  apply to the same name, when bestowed by Mr. Rittenhouse himself, on\r\n  the grand machine of his own invention and construction. How improper\r\n  soever this name may have been in its first application to a\r\n  planetarium, it has since been generally applied to similar machines;\r\n  and it has thus acquired an appropriate signification in relation to\r\n  them. Mr. Rittenhouse did not choose to depart from the appellation in\r\n  common use, in naming a machine for surpassing, in ingenuity of\r\n  contrivance, accuracy and utility, any thing of the kind ever before\r\n  constructed; yet, in all those points of excellence, he was the\r\n  inventor of that admirable machine, which has been generally\r\n  denominated, by others, “the Rittenhouse Orrery.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is not ascertained, at what time Mr. Rittenhouse first conceived the\r\nplan of that extensive, complicated and inestimable Orrery, which he\r\nafterwards executed. Probably, he had long thought on the subject,\r\nbefore he publicly announced his design. It is certain, however, that\r\nbefore the beginning of the year 1767, there was some correspondence and\r\nsome understanding, respecting it, between himself and the Rev. Mr.\r\nBarton. It appears in fact, that, prior to that period, Mr. Barton had\r\nbeen fully apprized of his brother-in-law’s desire to carry into effect\r\nhis meditated design of constructing a complete Orrery, on a plan\r\nentirely new; and that some arrangement was previously made, between\r\nthese gentlemen; by which Mr. Barton undertook to indemnify Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, for such actual expenditures as he should incur in making\r\nthe machine and his loss of time while employed in the work, not\r\nexceeding a stipulated sum; provided he should not be able to dispose of\r\nit, when finished, at a price then fixed on. The prudential caution of\r\nour young Philosopher (then about thirty-four years of age,) and the\r\npublic spirit of his friend, grounded on the confidence he had in the\r\nartist’s talents and abilities, were alike evinced on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe first written communication made by Mr. Rittenhouse to Mr. Barton,\r\non the subject of the Orrery, is contained in a letter under the date of\r\nJan. 28th, 1767: it is in these words:—“I am glad you took the pains to\r\ntranscribe, and send me, Martin’s _Account of Orreries_.”[137] “Two\r\nforms (he says) have principally obtained, the Hemispherical Orrery and\r\nthe Whole Sphere. But the idea given us by the former, is very unnatural\r\nand imperfect. An Orrery, then, adapted to an Armillary Sphere is the\r\nonly machine that can exhibit a just idea of the true System of the\r\nWorld.”—“But in my opinion,” says Mr. Rittenhouse, “the latter is\r\nlikewise very unnatural; for, what has a Sphere, consisting of a great\r\nnumber of metaline Circles, to do with the true System of the World? Is\r\nthere one real, or so much as apparent Circle, in it? (the bodies of the\r\nSun and Planets excepted.) Are they not all merely imaginary lines,\r\ncontrived for the purpose of calculation? I did not intend to let one of\r\nthem have a place in my Orrery, except the Zodiac, on which I would have\r\nthe true latitude and longitude of each planet pointed out by its proper\r\nIndex.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  See Note 131.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“I did not design a Machine, which should give the ignorant in astronomy\r\na just view of the Solar System: but would rather astonish the skilful\r\nand curious examiner, by a most accurate correspondence between the\r\nsituations and motions of our little representatives of the heavenly\r\nbodies, and the situations and motions of those bodies, themselves. I\r\nwould have my Orrery really useful, by making it capable of informing\r\nus, truly, of the astronomical phænomena for any particular point of\r\ntime; which, I do not find that any Orrery yet made, can do.”\r\n\r\n“But,” continues Mr. Rittenhouse, “perhaps it may be necessary to comply\r\nwith the prevailing taste: If so, my plan must be entirely altered;—and\r\nthis is a matter that must be settled between you and me, before I can\r\nproceed. However, I shall send you, in my next, a particular account of\r\nmy design; such as I would have it, if not limited by the fear of making\r\nit too expensive.—A specimen (if I may so call it) of the most curious\r\npart of it, though much smaller than that intended for the Orrery, is\r\nnow in hand, and I hope will soon be finished.”\r\n\r\nTo this letter Mr. Barton returned the following answer.\r\n\r\n                                      “_Lancaster, February 21st, 1767._\r\n\r\n  “Dear Brother,\r\n\r\n      “I received, a few days ago, yours of the 28th ult.—after it had\r\n  undergone the torture of some Dutchman’s pocket, which compelled it to\r\n  force its way through the cover: However, the inside did escape\r\n  without many fractures; so that I had the pleasure of getting it into\r\n  my hands in such a condition that I could read it.\r\n\r\n  “Had I known your distress, at the time you received my letter, I\r\n  should have sincerely felt for you. I well know the anxiety of an\r\n  husband, on such occasions, and my heart will ever join in sympathy\r\n  with him: For you, my feelings would have been doubled, as a husband,\r\n  as my friend and brother. Glad I am, therefore, that I have no\r\n  occasion to condole with you, but rather to rejoice; and I most\r\n  sincerely and affectionately congratulate you, on the escape and\r\n  recovery of your good girl, and wish you joy of your daughter. I\r\n  desire to offer my best regards to sister Nelly, for the compliment\r\n  she intended me, had her child been a boy. Her intention was kind, and\r\n  I hope to have the continuance of her favourable opinion of me.\r\n\r\n  “I am much pleased with your remarks on Spherical Orreries, or rather\r\n  on the circles generally adapted to such Orreries. Mr. Rowning seems\r\n  to be so much of the same opinion, that I could not deny myself the\r\n  pleasure of transcribing some part of his account of Orreries, and of\r\n  an imaginary machine, which he thinks might be made very useful.[138]\r\n  Several of his hints appear to me ingenious, and I hope they will not\r\n  be unacceptable to you.\r\n\r\n  “I would have you pursue your Orrery in your own way, without any\r\n  regard to an ignorant or prevailing taste. All you have to study is\r\n  truth, and to display the glorious system of Copernicus in a proper\r\n  manner;—and to make your machine as much an original, as possible. I\r\n  beg you will not limit yourself in the price. I am now perfectly\r\n  convinced, that you can dispose of it to advantage; and should be\r\n  sorry you would lose one hour more in fears or doubts about it. In\r\n  fact, I have laid such plans for the disposal of it, that I have\r\n  almost a moral certainty of having a demand for more than one of the\r\n  kind. I have not time to write you as fully as I could wish, as the\r\n  transcribing from Rowning has detained me so long, and I am this\r\n  moment setting out for Caernarvon.\r\n\r\n  “My letter to the Proprietor[139] is delayed, till I can send him the\r\n  account of your design, which you are pleased to promise me. You say\r\n  you have “a specimen” in hand: I should be glad to know what it is.\r\n\r\n  “I shall not neglect the things you mentioned to me, as I shall always\r\n  receive a pleasure in serving you....

Thomas Penn, of Stoke-Poges, in Buckinghamshire, heretofore\r\n  one of the Proprietaries of the former province of Pennsylvania. This\r\n  gentleman was then usually styled, in Pennsylvania, “The Proprietor.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHis next letter to Mr. Barton, covering the promised Account of his\r\nOrrery, is dated the 27th of March, 1767: and this, it will be\r\nperceived, is very nearly a year before a description of it was\r\ncommunicated to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. In\r\nthis letter, he says—“Rowning’s opinion of Orreries pleases me more than\r\nany thing I had met with before. The idea of his _imaginary_ machine\r\nnaturally presents itself to persons conversant in Astronomy; but, if\r\nactually made, it could not answer the purpose, unless prodigiously\r\nlarge,—which I presume is the reason it has never been done.\r\n\r\n“I send you a description of _my_ imaginary machine: the foundation of\r\nit is now laid; and I hope that part of it, containing the mechanical\r\nAstronomy of the Moon, will be finished some time this spring: _then_ we\r\nshall be able to judge, whether my abilities are equal to the\r\nundertaking.”\r\n\r\nThe “Description” here referred to, in Mr. Rittenhouse’s own\r\nhand-writing, is new before the writer of these Memoirs; and is thus\r\nendorsed by the Rev. Mr. Barton—“Original Description of Mr.\r\nRittenhouse’s Orrery, first communicated to Thomas Barton.”—For the\r\nsatisfaction of those, who may not have an opportunity of seeing the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society’s Transactions, in which this short\r\naccount of the Orrery was afterwards published; and, as this _original_\r\ndescription of it differs somewhat from the _printed_ one, it is\r\npresumed that the introduction of the former into this work, will not be\r\nunacceptable to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of conveying to the mind of any one, even the most\r\nintelligent and skilful, by means of either any delineation upon paper\r\nin the nature of a diagram, or by words, an adequate idea of so complex\r\nand multiform a machine as the one now about to be described, will\r\ninstantly be conceived. Indeed no description, alone, can render the\r\nnature of its construction, and the many curious and useful purposes it\r\nis capable of answering, perfectly intelligible to the most scientific\r\nAstronomer. Mr. Rittenhouse’s very concise description of his Orrery\r\nwill, therefore, necessarily be found defective: it is thus worded by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n                     “DESCRIPTION OF A NEW ORRERY.\r\n\r\n“This Machine is intended to have three faces, standing perpendicular to\r\nthe horizon: that in the front to be four feet square, made of\r\nsheet-brass, curiously polished, silvered, and painted in proper places,\r\nand otherwise ornamented. From the centre arises an axis, to support a\r\ngilded brass ball, intended to represent the Sun. Round this ball move\r\nothers, made of brass or ivory, to represent the Planets: They are to\r\nmove in elliptical orbits, having the central ball in one focus; and\r\ntheir motions to be sometimes swifter, and sometimes slower, as nearly\r\naccording to the true law of an equable description of areas as is\r\npossible, without too great a complication of wheel-work. The orbit of\r\neach Planet is likewise to be properly inclined to those of the others;\r\nand their Aphelia and Nodes justly placed; and their velocities so\r\naccurately adjusted, as not to differ sensibly from the tables of\r\nAstronomy in some thousands of years.\r\n\r\n“For the greater beauty of the instrument, the balls representing the\r\nplanets are to be of a considerable bigness; but so contrived, that they\r\nmay be taken off at pleasure, and others, much smaller, and fitter for\r\nsome purposes, put in their places.\r\n\r\n“When the Machine is put in motion, by the turning of a winch, there are\r\nthree indexes which point out the hour of the day, the day of the month,\r\nand the year (according to the Julian account,) answering to that\r\nsituation of the heavenly bodies which is then represented; and so\r\ncontinually, for a period of 5000 years, either forward or backward.\r\n\r\n“In order to know the true situation of a Planet at any particular time,\r\nthe small set of balls are to be put each on its respective axis; then\r\nthe winch to be turned round until each index points to the given time.\r\nThen a small telescope, made for the purpose, is to be applied to the\r\ncentral ball; and directing it to the planet, its longitude and\r\ninclination will be seen on a large brass circle, silvered, and properly\r\ngraduated, representing the zodiac, and having a motion of one degree in\r\nseventy-two years, agreeable to the precession of the equinoxes. So,\r\nlikewise, by applying the telescope to the ball representing the earth,\r\nand directing it to any planet,—then will both the longitude and\r\nlatitude of that planet be pointed out (by an index and graduated\r\ncircle,) as seen from the earth.\r\n\r\n“The two lesser faces are four feet in height, and two feet three inches\r\nin breadth. One of them will exhibit all the appearances of Jupiter and\r\nhis Satellites—their eclipses, transits, and inclinations; likewise, all\r\nthe appearances of Saturn, with his ring and satellites. And the other\r\nwill represent all the phænomena of the moon, particularly, the exact\r\ntime, quantity, and duration of her eclipses—and those of the sun,\r\noccasioned by her interposition; with a most curious contrivance for\r\nexhibiting the appearance of a solar eclipse, at any particular place on\r\nthe earth: likewise, the true place of the moon in the signs, with her\r\nlatitude, and the place of her apoge in the nodes; the sun’s\r\ndeclination, equation of time &c. It must be understood, that all these\r\nmotions are to correspond exactly, with the celestial motions; and not\r\nto differ several degrees from the truth, in a few revolutions, as is\r\ncommon in Orreries.\r\n\r\n“If it shall be thought proper, the whole is to be adapted to, and kept\r\nin motion by, a strong pendulum-clock; nevertheless, at liberty to be\r\nturned by the winch, and adjusted to any time, past or future.”\r\n\r\n“N. B. The diurnal motions of such planets as have been discovered to\r\nrevolve on their own axes, are likewise to be properly represented; both\r\nwith regard to the Times, and the situation of their Poles.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a literal copy of the original manuscript; and such\r\nreaders of this article as may think proper to compare it with the\r\nprinted description of Mr. Rittenhouse’s Orrery, communicated to the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society by Dr. Smith, on the 21st of March 1768,\r\nand contained in the first volume of that Society’s Transactions, will\r\nfind some (though, on the whole, not very essential) differences, in the\r\ntwo descriptions. The concluding paragraph, indeed,—designated, in each,\r\nby a N. B.—is materially variant in the two: and it appears, by its\r\nhaving been announced in the published (and later) account of this\r\nmachine, that, “the clock part of it may be contrived to play a great\r\nvariety of Music,” (a suggestion wholly omitted in Mr. Rittenhouse’s\r\noriginal communication, made to the Rev. Mr. Barton,) that the\r\nphilosophic Artist had been afterwards induced, in one particular at\r\nleast, “to comply with the prevailing taste.”[140] But this may be\r\nreadily accounted for: our artist had previously made some extremely\r\ncurious and beautiful Time-pieces, to each of which was attached the\r\nmechanism of a Musical Clock, in addition to a limited Planetarium, in\r\nminiature. These were in the hands of gentlemen of respectability and\r\ntaste:[141] and they were much and generally admired, as well for the\r\ngreat ingenuity displayed by the constructor, in these combined and\r\npleasing operations of his machinery, as for the superior accuracy and\r\nbeauty of the workmanship; qualities eminently conspicuous in all his\r\nmechanical productions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  This design was, however, finally abandoned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  One of these valuable clocks, which is of a large size, with an\r\n  accurate little planetarium attached to its face and placed above the\r\n  dial-plate,[141a] was made for the late Mr. Joseph Potts, of\r\n  Philadelphia county, who paid for it, as the writer is informed, six\r\n  hundred and forty dollars. In the spring of the year 1774, it was\r\n  purchased by the late Mr. Thomas Prior, of Philadelphia; to whom, it\r\n  is said, general Sir William Howe made an offer of one hundred and\r\n  twenty guineas for it, shortly before the evacuation of that city, in\r\n  1778. It is also said, that Don Joseph de Jaudenes, late minister of\r\n  Spain to the United States, offered Mr. Prior eight hundred dollars\r\n  for this clock, with a view of presenting it to his sovereign. Mr.\r\n  Prior, however, retained it until his death, in the spring of the year\r\n  1801: after which, it passed through two other hands, successively,\r\n  into the possession of Professor Barton, of Philadelphia, whose\r\n  property it now is.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141a:\r\n\r\n  The area of the face of the dial plate is twenty inches square, and\r\n  the motions and places of the planets of our system are represented on\r\n  a circular area of eight inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt appears, that when Mr. Rittenhouse sent the foregoing description of\r\nhis projected Orrery to Mr. Barton—that is to say, on the 27th of March,\r\n1767[142]—the “foundation” of it was “laid.” But, notwithstanding his\r\nearnest wishes prompted him to the utmost diligence, in his exertions to\r\nfinish it, many circumstances concurred to retard its completion. The\r\nmagnitude of the undertaking—the multiplicity of the work—and, perhaps,\r\nthe difficulty of sometimes readily procuring, even from Philadelphia,\r\nthe necessary materials,—all conspired, to prevent as early a completion\r\nof the machinery as he had anticipated: and, added to these causes of\r\nunavoidable delay, was the yet unabandoned pursuit of his professional\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  It appears that Mr. Barton must have transmitted to the honourable Mr.\r\n  T. Penn, in London, a description of the Orrery, very soon after it\r\n  was publicly communicated to the Philosophical Society in\r\n  Philadelphia; for, a letter from Mr. Penn to that gentleman, dated\r\n  July 22, 1768, contains this remark—“The account you give me of Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse’s Orrery, is what I could not have imagined could be\r\n  executed in Pennsylvania; and I shall be much pleased to see a\r\n  copper-plate of it, for which I would make that gentleman a present,\r\n  for his encouragement; or, perhaps he may be induced to bring it\r\n  hither, and exhibit it, by publicly lecturing on it.”\r\n\r\n  Had Mr. Rittenhouse taken an Orrery to England, and it appears by his\r\n  letters of March 15, 1771, and Feb. 3, 1772, quoted in the text, that\r\n  he had seriously intended going thither, he would, very probably, have\r\n  derived great emolument, as well as fame, by delivering lectures on\r\n  astronomy, adapted to his orrery; and it is probable, that, in\r\n  addition to the public encouragement he might reasonably have\r\n  calculated upon, Mr. Penn would have patronised him, with his usual\r\n  liberality. Of the disposition of that worthy gentleman to befriend\r\n  him, Mr. Rittenhouse seems to have been fully sensible: for, in a\r\n  letter of the 11th of December, 1768, to Mr. Barton, he said—“I am\r\n  very desirous to send Mr. Penn something: as the orrery is not\r\n  finished, perhaps a description of it, with draughts of the clock I\r\n  have just made, may answer the purpose, together with some little\r\n  instrument: I shall be glad to have your thoughts on the matter.” It\r\n  may be proper here to remark, that no engraving, or drawing, could\r\n  give an adequate idea of the orrery: and that the clock, mentioned by\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse, was one of those of which a short notice is\r\n  introduced, immediately after the original description of the orrery,\r\n  in the text.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Orrery was, nevertheless, then his favourite object. On the 18th of\r\nJune, 1767, he wrote to Mr. Barton, thus—“I hope you will persuade your\r\nPequea friends to stay for the clocks, till harvest is over; and then, I\r\nthink, I may venture to promise them, for ready money: but, at this\r\ntime, one part of the Orrery is in such forwardness, that I am not\r\nwilling to lay it by till it is done. I hope it will far exceed the\r\ndescription I gave you of it. To-morrow morning I am to set off for\r\nReading, at the request of the Commissioners of Berks county, who wrote\r\nto me about their town-clock. They had employed a ... to make it, who,\r\nit seems, is not able to go through with it: if I should undertake to\r\nfinish it, this will likewise retard the great work.”\r\n\r\nAmidst the more important philosophical pursuits which engaged Mr.\r\nRittenhouse’s attention before his removal to Philadelphia, as well as\r\nafter he fixed his residence in that city, he now and then relaxed the\r\nenergy of his mind from its employment in laborious investigations, by\r\nbestowing a portion of his time on minor objects in physical science;\r\nand indeed, sometimes, even on little matters of ingenuity, curiosity\r\nand amusement. As instances of this, he addressed to the Rev. Mr. Barton\r\nthe letter under the date of the 20th of July, 1768, which will be found\r\nin the Appendix; and also another, dated the 4th of February, 1770, to\r\nwhich there is the following postscript:\r\n\r\n“I have,” says he, “seen a little curiosity, with which you would be\r\npleased; I mean the glass described by Dr. Franklin, wherein water may\r\nbe kept in a boiling state, by the heat of the hand alone, and that for\r\nhours together. The first time I shall be in Lancaster, where I hope to\r\nbe next June, I expect to prevail on you to accompany me to the\r\nGlass-house,[143] where we may have some of them made, as well as some\r\nother things I want.”—A description of this instrument, then usually\r\ncalled _Dr. Franklin’s Pulse-Glass_,[144] by means of which water may be\r\nmade to boil, _in vacuo_, by the heat of the human hand, was\r\ncommunicated by Mr. Rittenhouse to Mr. Barton in a subsequent letter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  The glass-house mentioned in the text, was erected several years prior\r\n  to the American revolutionary war, at the village of Manheim, about\r\n  twelve miles from the borough of Lancaster, by Mr. Henry William\r\n  Stiegel, an ingenious and enterprising German gentleman. Glass of a\r\n  very good quality and workmanship, was made at that glass-house; as\r\n  will appear by the following extracts from a letter of Mr. Rittenhouse\r\n  to Mr. Barton, written in the summer of 1771, and acknowledging the\r\n  receipt of a barometer-tube executed there. He says—“I am obliged to\r\n  you for the glass tube; it will make a pretty barometer, though the\r\n  bore is somewhat too small. I have compared it with an English tube,\r\n  and do not think the preference can, with any reason, be given to the\r\n  latter.” And in the same letter, he requests Mr. Barton to procure for\r\n  him, from the glass-house, “some tubes of a size fit for\r\n  spirit-levels.” “The bore,” says he, “must be half an inch in\r\n  diameter, and from four to eight inches in length; as straight as\r\n  possible, and open at one end only.”\r\n\r\n  While Mr. Stiegel was thus early and meritoriously carrying on the\r\n  manufacture of glass, he was also engaged in manufacturing iron at\r\n  Elizabeth-Furnace in the vicinity, which then belonged to him. But he\r\n  proved unfortunate in his extensive undertakings, and the glass-works\r\n  have not since been in operation. The foundery of Elizabeth, together\r\n  with the great establishment of iron-works connected with it, and of\r\n  which Robert Coleman, Esq. of Lancaster, is now the proprietor, are\r\n  well known.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Franklin is said to have first met with the Pulse-Glass in\r\n  Germany, and to have introduced it into England with some improvement\r\n  of his own.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MEMOIR\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n                       LIFE OF DAVID RITTENHOUSE;\r\n                               CONTINUED,\r\n            FROM THE TIME OF HIS SETTLEMENT IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1770, our Philosopher changed the place of his\r\nresidence; removing, with his family, into the city of Philadelphia. To\r\nthis exchange of his beloved retirement, at his Norriton farm, for the\r\nscene of noise and activity presented by a great town, he must have been\r\ninduced by the flattering prospects of advantage to himself and\r\nusefulness to the public, pointed out to him by his friends: and among\r\nthese, Dr. Smith was one of the most urgent for the measure. The\r\nfollowing extract of a letter, dated the 27th of January, 1770, and\r\naddressed to the Rev. Mr. Barton by that gentleman, will explain his\r\nmotives, and at the same time exhibit Mr. Rittenhouse’s views, on that\r\noccasion: it will also afford strong evidence of the Doctor’s friendship\r\nfor our philosopher.\r\n\r\n“As my esteem for Mr. Rittenhouse increases, the more I know him,” said\r\nDr. Smith, “I set on foot a project, assisted by my neighbours, the\r\nWissahickon millers, to get him recommended to the Assembly, to be put\r\nin as a trustee of the loan-office, in the bill now before the house. I\r\nfirst broke the matter to the speaker;[145] telling him, Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nought to be encouraged to come to town, to take a lead in a manufacture,\r\noptical and mathematical, which never had been attempted in America, and\r\ndrew thousands of pounds to England for instruments, often ill finished;\r\nand that it would redound to the honour of Philadelphia to take a lead\r\nin this, and of the Assembly, to encourage it. The speaker took the\r\nproposal well, and, in short, so did every person applied to; and when\r\nthe vote passed, the day before yesterday, for the three trustees, the\r\nwhole house rose for Rittenhouse’s name; so that Mr. Allen,[146] who was\r\nhearty among the rest for him, observed—“_Our name is Legion, for this\r\nvote_,”—though Dr. M—— got in only by the speaker’s casting vote.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Joseph Galloway, Esq. a representative in assembly from the county of\r\n  Bucks. He was speaker of the house, from the year 1766 to 1773,\r\n  inclusively; excepting a short interval in the session of 1768-9, in\r\n  which Joseph Fox, Esq. officiated as speaker.\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  William Allen, Esq. chief-justice of the supreme court of\r\n  Pennsylvania, and a member of assembly from the county of Cumberland.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“This will give you pleasure, as it shews that a good man is capable of\r\nsometimes commanding all parties; and it will be creditable for Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, even if the bill should not succeed for the present. The\r\nsalary to each of the trustees is 200_l._[147] Both the Mr. Ross’s,[148]\r\nMr. Biddle,[149] and Mr. Carpenter,[150] were hearty in their interest\r\nfor Rittenhouse,—so was Minshull;[151] and I hope you will thank them\r\nall. The governor[152] declared (and with more frankness than usual,)\r\nwhen I waited on him,—“Mr. Rittenhouse’s name shall never be an\r\nobjection with me, in this or any other bill: on the contrary, I shall\r\nrejoice if the bill come to me in such a form, as that I can shew my\r\nregard for him.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  Equal to 533 Spanish or American dollars.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  John and George Ross, Esqrs. lawyers of great respectability, and\r\n  brothers; the former a resident in Philadelphia; the latter in\r\n  Lancaster.

These were John Dickinson, Charles Humphreys,\r\n  John Morton, George Ross, Thomas Mifflin, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas\r\n  Willing and James Wilson, Esqrs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  Emanuel Carpenter, Esq. long a respectable member of assembly from\r\n  Lancaster county.\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  Thomas Minshull, Esq. a respectable member of the house, from York\r\n  county.\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:\r\n\r\n  The Hon.

The\r\nhouse insist on putting the names in the bill, before it goes up: the\r\nGovernor contends, that he ought to have at least a share in the\r\nnomination. This matter has been long litigated. The governor, to\r\nmaintain his right, always strikes out _some_ names—even though he\r\napproves of them, and puts in others. This he did last year, and put in\r\nthe name of Dr. M——, and the other trustee now in the bill. The house\r\nwould not admit his amendment, then; but now, this year, they take two\r\nof the very men the governor had appointed last year, vote them in\r\nthemselves, and join Mr. Rittenhouse with them. The governor cannot well\r\n_negative_ any of those approved by him, before; yet he must negative\r\n_some one_, to assert his right;—and I believe it would really give him\r\npain, if _that_ one should be _David_.\r\n\r\n“I am thus particular,” continues the Doctor, “that you may understand\r\nthe whole, and not think our friend slighted by the government, even if\r\nthis thing should not succeed. All the council[153] are hearty for Mr.\r\nRittenhouse; and if he does not get this matter, he will not be long\r\nwithout something else. But I hope some expedient may be hit upon, to\r\ncompromise the matter, should the bill not have faults in itself, that\r\nmay set it aside.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:\r\n\r\n  The proprietary’s and governor’s council, consisting of James\r\n  Hamilton, William Allen, Joseph Turner, William Logan, Richard Peters\r\n  (D.

Esquire, officiated many years as provincial\r\n  secretary and clerk of the council.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe warm and sincere interest which Mr. Barton took in every thing that\r\nseemed likely to promote the welfare of his brother-in-law, was\r\nmanifested on this occasion. In his answer to Dr. Smith’s letter,\r\nwritten a week after, he says: “Your letter by Mr. Slough was so truly\r\nobliging and friendly, that I cannot think of words strong enough to\r\nexpress my gratitude. Rittenhouse, I trust, will always be sensible of\r\nthe favours you have shewn him, and of the uncommon pains you have taken\r\nto serve him on this occasion, which have been represented to me, fully,\r\nby Mr. Slough.[154] Accept then, dear sir, my most hearty thanks for\r\nyour kind offices in behalf of Mr. Rittenhouse. Accept of my wife’s best\r\nthanks, also — —. She shed tears of gratitude, when she read your\r\nletter, (for her attachment to her brother David is very great,) and\r\ndeclared, in a high strain of enthusiasm, that Dr. Smith was the most\r\nsteady friend and obliging man that ever lived; that she should honour\r\nand respect him, while living, and, should she survive him, would always\r\nrevere his memory. Thus it was, that the sister of your ‘optical and\r\nmathematical’ friend expressed herself on the occasion.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  Matthias Slough, Esq. who served several years with reputation as a\r\n  representative in the assembly, from the county of Lancaster.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fair prospects which Mr. Rittenhouse thus had, in\r\nthe beginning of the year 1770, of being enabled to establish himself in\r\nPhiladelphia, with a handsome salary of 200_l._ _per annum_ from the\r\ngovernment, in addition to such funds as he might reasonably calculate\r\non acquiring, in that capital, by his professional occupation, both he\r\nand his friends were disappointed, in regard to the contemplated\r\nofficial station: The assembly rose, as Dr. Smith seemed to have\r\nanticipated a very short time before, without passing the loan-office\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse’s actual removal into the city, in the succeeding\r\nautumn, appears to have been made in pursuance of a previous\r\ndetermination more recently formed;[155] one founded on some plan, not\r\nliable to be affected by such contingencies as have been just noticed.\r\nPrior to that period, his Orrery was nearly if not quite completed: for\r\nit appears by a letter which he wrote to Mr. Barton from Norriton, on\r\nthe 12th of May preceding his removal to the city, that the trustees of\r\nNassau-Hall, in New-Jersey, had then agreed on some terms with him, as\r\nthe inventor, maker, and proprietor, for the purchase of it.[156] The\r\ntrustees of the College of Philadelphia had likewise been in treaty with\r\nhim, for the same purpose: but the Princeton College succeeded in their\r\nnegociation, and thus acquired the property of the Orrery first\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  On the 4th of Feb. 1770, he mentioned to Mr. Barton his then\r\n  contemplated removal into that city, in these terms—“Dr. Smith, to\r\n  whom I am indebted for many kindnesses, is very urgent to have me come\r\n  to Philadelphia to reside, which it is probable I may do shortly: but\r\n  I am not yet determined. If I live to write again, you shall know more\r\n  of my mind; in the mean time, I shall be glad to have your opinion of\r\n  the matter.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  Since writing the above the author has ascertained, that towards the\r\n  close of April, 1770, the orrery was purchased for the college of\r\n  New-Jersey. On the 23d of that month, Dr. Witherspoon, then the\r\n  president of that college, accompanied by some gentlemen, went to\r\n  Norriton for that purpose, and it appears that the orrery was then\r\n  nearly finished.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis circumstance gave, at the time, some dissatisfaction to the more\r\nimmediate friends of the Philadelphia institution; though it is\r\nconfidently believed that no degree of censure, whatever, could be\r\njustly imputed to Mr. Rittenhouse, on the occasion; perhaps, none was\r\nfairly chargeable on any of the parties. Mr. Rittenhouse, however,\r\nexperienced some unpleasant sensations; although, in order to avoid any\r\nsuspicion of his having been actuated by an undue partiality towards the\r\nCollege of Princeton, he had made such a stipulation in favour of its\r\nsister-institution, as could not fail, when made known, to remove any\r\nimputation of impropriety of conduct on his part, in the transaction.\r\nThis is explained by the following passage in the letter to his\r\nbrother-in-law, last referred to,—evidently penned without any reserve.\r\nAfter noticing the dissatisfaction just mentioned, he says—“I would not,\r\non any account, incur the imputation of cunning; nor are there,\r\nprobably, many persons living who deserve it less: yet I am greatly\r\nmistaken if this matter” (his transfer of the Orrery to Princeton\r\nCollege) “does not, in the end, turn out to my advantage, and\r\nconsequently, to your satisfaction. At present, the point is settled as\r\nfollows: I am to begin another” (Orrery) “immediately, and finish it\r\nexpeditiously, for the College of Philadelphia. This I am not sorry for;\r\nsince the making of a second will be but an amusement, compared with the\r\nfirst: And who knows, but that the rest of the colonies may catch the\r\ncontagion.”[157]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  The following extract of a letter from Dr. Smith to Mr. Barton,\r\n  written the day after Mr. Rittenhouse’s on the same subject, will\r\n  further explain the embarrassing circumstances that attended this\r\n  transaction, and the delicate situation in which Mr. Rittenhouse,\r\n  particularly, was placed.\r\n\r\n  “I never,” said the Doctor, “met with greater mortification, than to\r\n  find Mr. Rittenhouse had, in my absence, made a sort of agreement to\r\n  let his Orrery go to the Jersey College. I had constantly told him,\r\n  that if the Assembly did not take it, I would take it for our College,\r\n  and would have paid the full sum, should I have begged the money. I\r\n  thought I could depend, as much as on any thing under the sun, that\r\n  after Mr. Rittenhouse knew my intentions about it, he would not have\r\n  listened to any proposal for disposing of it, without advising me, and\r\n  giving our College the first opportunity to purchase. I think Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse was never so little _himself_, as to suffer himself to be\r\n  taken off his guard on this occasion. This province is willing to\r\n  honour him, as her _own_: and believe me, many of his friends wondered\r\n  at the newspaper article; and regretted that he should think so little\r\n  of his _noble_ invention, as to consent to let it go to a village;\r\n  unless he had first found, on trial, that his friends in this city had\r\n  not spirit to take it: For if he would wish to be known by _this\r\n  work_—and introduced to the best business and commissions for\r\n  instruments, from all parts of the continent,—his _Orrery_ being\r\n  placed in our College, where so many strangers would have an\r\n  opportunity of seeing it, was the sure way to be serviceable to\r\n  Himself.\r\n\r\n  “You will think, by all this, that I am offended with him, and that\r\n  our friendship may hereby be interrupted: Far from it—I went to see\r\n  him, the day the newspaper announced the affair. I soon found that I\r\n  had little occasion to say any thing: he was convinced, before I saw\r\n  him, that he had gone too far. But still, as no time was fixed for\r\n  delivering the Orrery, I was glad to find he had concluded that it\r\n  should not be delivered till next winter; against which time, he said,\r\n  he could have a _second_ one made, if this one staid with him for his\r\n  hands to work by. As I love Mr. Rittenhouse, and would not give a man\r\n  of such delicate feelings a moment’s uneasiness, I agreed to wave the\r\n  _honour_ of having the first Orrery, and to take the second.”\r\n\r\n  In fact, the Orrery was not at that time finished; for Mr. Rittenhouse\r\n  then informed Dr. Smith, that he was under the necessity of waiting\r\n  for brass from England, to enable him to complete it. “The result\r\n  (continued the Doctor) will be, I think, that he will keep his Orrery\r\n  till towards winter; and should they not _then_ receive it, in the\r\n  Jersies, they will take it at New-York.”\r\n\r\n  On the 7th of the following month, Dr. Smith wrote thus finally, to\r\n  Mr. Barton, on this subject—“Your and my friend, Mr. Rittenhouse, will\r\n  be with you on Saturday. The Governor says, the Orrery shall not go:\r\n  he would rather pay for it, himself. He has ordered a meeting of the\r\n  Trustees on Tuesday next; and declares it as his opinion, that we\r\n  ought to have the _first_ Orrery, and not the second,—even if the\r\n  second should be the best.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe second Orrery was soon completed: for, on the 15th of March, 1771,\r\nonly ten months after the date of his last quoted letter to the Rev. Mr.\r\nBarton, he wrote to that gentleman, on the subject, in these words. “Dr.\r\nSmith bids me to tell you he will write by your son William. He is fully\r\nemployed, at present, with his Lectures, and has great success, having\r\nraised upwards of two hundred pounds.[158] I am sure you would afford me\r\n_some additional compassion_, if you knew the drudgery of explaining the\r\nOrrery to two hundred persons,[159] in small companies of ten or twelve,\r\neach: the satisfaction they universally express, makes however some\r\namends.”[160]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Dr. Peters wrote thus to Mr. Barton, under the date of March\r\n  22, 1771—“Dr. Smith has done wonders in favour of our friend\r\n  Rittenhouse. His zeal has been very active: he has got enough to pay\r\n  him for a second orrery; and the assembly has given him 300_l._ The\r\n  Doctor, in his introductory lecture, was honoured with the principal\r\n  men of all denominations, who swallowed every word he said, with the\r\n  pleasure that attends eating the choicest viands; and in the close,\r\n  when he came to mention the orrery, he over-excelled his very\r\n  self!”—“Your son will acquaint you with all the particulars respecting\r\n  it. The lectures are crowded by such as think they can, thereby, be\r\n  made capable of understanding that wonderful machine: whereas, after\r\n  all, their eyes only will give them the truth, from the figures, and\r\n  motions, and places, and magnitudes of the heavenly bodies.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  The author of _The Vision of Columbus_, a Poem, (first published at\r\n  Hartford in Connecticut, in the beginning of the year 1787,) alludes\r\n  to the Rittenhouse-Orrery, and to the numerous resort of persons to\r\n  the College-Hall, for the purpose of viewing that machine, in the\r\n  following lines, (book vii.)\r\n\r\n          “See the sage RITTENHOUSE, with ardent eye,\r\n          Lift the long tube and pierce the starry sky;\r\n          Clear in his view the circling systems roll,\r\n          And broader splendours gild the central pole.\r\n          He marks what laws th’ eccentric wand’rers bind,\r\n          Copies Creation in his forming mind,\r\n          And bids, beneath his hand, in semblance rise,\r\n          With mimic orbs, the labours of the skies.\r\n          There wond’ring crouds with raptur’d eye behold\r\n          The spangled Heav’ns their mystic maze unfold;\r\n          While each glad sage his splendid Hall shall grace,\r\n          With all the spheres that cleave th’ ethereal space.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  In a letter from Dr. Smith to Mr. Barton, dated March 23, 1771, is\r\n  this paragraph:—\r\n\r\n  “I have been so busy these two months past, that I could not find a\r\n  moment’s leisure to write. A good deal of time was to be given to the\r\n  public lectures, the Orrery, and the getting our dear friend\r\n  Rittenhouse brought into as advantageous a light as possible, on his\r\n  first entrance into this town as an inhabitant; all which has\r\n  succeeded to our utmost wishes; and the notice taken of him by the\r\n  province, is equally to his honour and theirs. The loss of his wife\r\n  has greatly disconcerted him; but we try to keep up his spirits, under\r\n  it.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe _italicised_ words, in the foregoing paragraph, have reference to a\r\ngreat domestic calamity Mr. Rittenhouse had experienced, only a very few\r\nmonths before,—the death of an affectionate wife, whom he tenderly\r\nloved. This afflicting event appears to have overspread, for some time,\r\nthe highly sensible and delicate mind of our Philosopher, with a\r\nconsiderable degree of gloominess. In this mood, then, he thus commenced\r\nthe letter just quoted: “_You_ are not unacquainted with the dismal\r\napprehensions of losing what is most dear to you” (alluding, here, to a\r\ndangerous fit of illness from which Mrs. Barton, the writer’s sister,\r\nhad recently recovered;) “and therefore you can better judge, than I can\r\ndescribe, what I feel at present. I do, indeed, endeavour to bear my\r\nloss in the manner you recommend: but how irksome does every thing seem!\r\nNothing interesting, nothing entertaining! except my two little girls;\r\nand yet my reflecting on their loss sinks me the deeper in affliction.\r\nWhat adds to my misfortune, is the hurry of business I am engaged in,\r\nand know not how to get rid of. My design, at present, is to keep the\r\nchildren with me, until I can conveniently take a ramble to Europe.”\r\nAnd, in the same strain of melancholy reflections, he concluded this\r\nletter to his friend and brother-in-law: “I suppose,” said he, “you have\r\nbeen informed, that the Assembly have made me a donation of three\r\nhundred pounds. This would have been very agreeable to me, if my poor\r\nEleanor had lived: but now, neither money—nor reputation—has any charms;\r\nthough I must still think them valuable, because absolutely necessary in\r\nthis unhappy life.”\r\n\r\nAlthough such was the keen sensibility of this amiable man, on so\r\ndistressing an occasion, his numerous avocations of business and\r\nstudies, aided by the correctness of his own reflections, gradually\r\ndispelled these over-shadowings of his dejected mind; and ere long, he\r\nvery naturally regained his usual serenity and cheerfulness of temper.\r\n\r\nA new phænomenon in the heavens soon after engaged his attention: this\r\nwas the Comet which appeared in June and July, 1770. His Observations on\r\nthis Comet, with the elements of its Motion and the Trajectory of its\r\nPath, were communicated to the American Philosophical Society, through\r\nhis friend Dr. Smith, on the 3d of August, soon after the Comet’s\r\ndisappearance, and were dated at Norriton the 24th of the preceding\r\nmonth. The letter to Dr. Smith, that covered this communication, and in\r\nwhich he says, “Herewith I send you the fruit of three or four days\r\nlabour, during which I have covered many sheets, and literally drained\r\nmy ink-stand several times”—will demonstrate how completely his mind was\r\noccupied in those researches.\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the following autumn, some accounts of Observations\r\nof this Comet in England and France, respectively, reached this country,\r\nwhen a further correspondence on the subject took place between Dr.\r\nSmith and Mr. Rittenhouse. These communications are published, entire,\r\nin the first volume of the Philosophical Society’s Transactions; and,\r\nwith those already noticed, complete the list of our Astronomer’s papers\r\nin that volume. It is here worthy of remark, that a comparison of Mr.\r\nRittenhouse’s Observations of this Comet with those of M. Messier in\r\nFrance and Mr. Six in England, confirmed the theory of the American\r\nObserver.\r\n\r\nBefore this subject is dismissed, however, it may not be deemed\r\nuninteresting to subjoin an extract of a letter which Mr. Rittenhouse\r\naddressed to the Rev. Mr. Barton (from Norriton,) on the 30th of July,\r\nrespecting the same Comet: it will, at least, serve to shew the zeal of\r\nour Astronomer, on the occasion.\r\n\r\n“I told you,” said Mr. Rittenhouse, “that some intricate calculation, or\r\nother, always takes up my idle hours” (he seems to have considered all\r\nhis hours as “idle” ones, which were not occupied in some manual\r\nemployment,) “that I cannot find time to write to my friends as often as\r\nI could wish: a new object has lately engrossed my attention. The Comet\r\nwhich appeared a few weeks since was so very extraordinary, that I could\r\nnot forbear tracing it in all its wanderings, and endeavouring to reduce\r\nthat motion to order and regularity, which seemed void of any. This, I\r\nthink, I have accomplished, so far as to be able to compute its visible\r\nplace for any given time: and I can assure you, that the account from\r\nYork, of its having been seen again near the place where it first\r\nappeared, is a mistake. Nor is Mr. Winthrop of Boston happier, in\r\nsupposing that it yet crosses the Meridian, every day, between twelve\r\nand one o’clock, that it has already passed its perihelion, and that it\r\nmay, perhaps, again emerge from the Southern Horizon. This Comet is now\r\nto be looked for no where but a little to the North of, and very near\r\nto, the Ecliptic. It rises now a little before day-break; and will\r\ncontinue to rise sooner and sooner, every morning. Yet perhaps, on\r\naccount of its smallness, we may see it no more; though I rather think\r\nwe shall: But I must stop, for fear of tiring you.”\r\n\r\nThe subjects of all Mr. Rittenhouse’s philosophical papers, comprised in\r\nthe first volume of the Society’s Transactions, having been now noticed,\r\nsome public acts connected with two of the objects to which those papers\r\nrelate, and which took place about the time to which these memoirs are\r\nbrought down shall, at present, be adverted to.\r\n\r\nThe Orrery had attracted a very general attention, among learned,\r\ningenious, and well-informed persons, in this country: it could not,\r\ntherefore, escape the notice of the then Legislature of Pennsylvania.\r\nAccordingly, the honourable testimony borne by that very respectable\r\nbody, to the merits of Mr. Rittenhouse, is thus expressed in the Journal\r\nof the House, under the date of March the 8th, 1771.\r\n\r\n“The members of assembly, having viewed the Orrery constructed by Mr.\r\nDavid Rittenhouse, a native of this Province, and being of opinion that\r\nit greatly exceeds all others hitherto constructed, in demonstrating the\r\ntrue Situations of the celestial Bodies, their Magnitudes, Motions,\r\nDistances, Periods, Eclipses, and Order, upon the principles of the\r\nNewtonian System:\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That the sum of three hundred pounds be given to Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, as a Testimony of the high sense which this House entertain\r\nof his Mathematical genius and Mechanical abilities, in constructing the\r\nsaid Orrery. And a Certificate for the said sum, being drawn at the\r\ntable, was signed by the Speaker and delivered to Mr. Evans.\r\n\r\n“_Ordered_, That Mr. Evans, Mr. Rhoads, Mr. James, Mr. Rodman, Mr.\r\nMorton, Mr. Carpenter, Mr. Montgomery, and Mr. Edwards, with the\r\nSpeaker,[161] be a Committee to agree with and purchase from Mr.\r\nRittenhouse a new Orrery, for the use of the Public, at any sum not\r\nexceeding four hundred pounds, lawful money of this Province.”[162]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  Joseph Galloway, Esq. was then speaker.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  The committee, named in the above order of the general assembly, made\r\n  the following report to that body, on the 24th of September, 1771;\r\n  viz.\r\n\r\n  “The committee appointed to agree with, and purchase from Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse a new Orrery for the use of the public, beg leave to\r\n  report, that they have, in pursuance of the order of assembly, agreed\r\n  with Mr. Rittenhouse for a new Orrery, at the price of four hundred\r\n  pounds, the price limited by the house; to consist of one principal\r\n  square (face,) of eight feet or more each way, with two wings; making\r\n  in the whole one large front, as nearly resembling the form of the\r\n  Orrery now standing in the College of the city of Philadelphia, as its\r\n  superior size will admit.” (Signed by all the members of the\r\n  committee.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the important object designed to have been obtained “for\r\nthe use of the Public,” by the Order which closes this legislative\r\nresolution was not executed. This disappointment of the liberal\r\nintentions of the Legislature arose, probably, from the many and arduous\r\nemployments in which Mr. Rittenhouse was almost constantly engaged, in\r\nthe short period which intervened between that time and the commencement\r\nof the troubles in America. But, whatever may have been the cause, the\r\nconsequence is much to be regretted.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1771, Mr. Rittenhouse was elected one of the Secretaries of\r\nthe American Philosophical Society; and on the 22d of February\r\nfollowing, an Address was presented to the General Assembly by that\r\nSociety, requesting the acceptance, by each Member of the House, of the\r\nfirst volume of the Society’s Transactions, then recently published.\r\nThis Address, which was signed by order and in behalf of the Society, by\r\nDr. Smith, Dr. Ewing, and Mr. Robert Strettel Jones, together with Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, as the Secretaries, was favourably received by the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nSome short time prior to this, viz. on the 22d of September, 1770, Dr.\r\nThomas Bond and Samuel Rhoads, Esq. two of the Vice-Presidents of the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society, had, by their Order and in their behalf,\r\ntransmitted to the General Assembly the Observations on the Transits of\r\nVenus and Mercury, then unpublished; not only those which had been made\r\nunder the directions of that Society, but such as had, in the\r\nintermediate time, been received from the other American Colonies and\r\nfrom England: the Society expressing, at the same time, a due sense of\r\nthe obligations they were under to the Assembly, “for the countenance\r\nand encouragement they had given them, in carrying on the designs of the\r\nInstitution; and, that they were particularly thankful for the generous\r\nassistance granted to them, for making those Observations.” They say\r\nfurther: “We have the pleasure to find they have been highly acceptable\r\nto those learned Bodies in Europe, to whom they have been communicated;”\r\nand, that they were “likely to be of great service, in settling that\r\nimportant point in Astronomy, which was proposed from the Transit of\r\nVenus.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these proceedings, that there was, at that day, a\r\nreciprocation of good will between the Legislature of Pennsylvania, and\r\na most valuable Scientific Institution, established within the bounds of\r\ntheir jurisdiction. While the legislative body, on the one hand,\r\nencouraged such institutions, and extended a liberal patronage to\r\npersons of genius and useful talents; men of learning and abilities, on\r\nthe other, were stimulated by a sense of gratitude, and a laudable\r\ndesire of honourable fame, to exert themselves for the public welfare.\r\n\r\nAmong the Members of the then General Assembly of Pennsylvania, were\r\nJohn Dickinson, William Allen, George Ross, Edward Biddle, Charles\r\nHumphreys, John Sellers, John and Israel Jacobs, and James Wright,\r\nbesides the very respectable characters named in the foregoing\r\nresolution and order of the House.[163]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Dickinson, Humphreys, Morton, Ross and Biddle, together with\r\n  Mifflin and Franklin, were delegated on the part of Pennsylvania to\r\n  the first general congress, which met in Philadelphia on the 5th of\r\n  September, 1774; and the same gentlemen, with the addition of Messrs.\r\n  Willing and Wilson, were also delegates from Pennsylvania in the\r\n  second general congress, which met in the same city on the 10th of\r\n  May, 1775. Of these “dignified and ever memorable assemblies,”\r\n  composed of that “illustrious band of patriots whose worth sheds a\r\n  lustre on the American character,” the great Washington was also a\r\n  member.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Dickinson, the writer of the celebrated _Farmer’s Letters_, was a\r\n  distinguished lawyer, statesman and scholar. Dr. Ramsay (who published\r\n  his _History of the American Revolution_ at the close of the year\r\n  1789,) remarks, that “the stamp-act, which was to have taken place in\r\n  1765, employed the pens and tongues of many of the colonists,” and,\r\n  that “the duties imposed in 1767, called forth the pen of John\r\n  Dickinson, who in a series of letters, signed ‘_A Pennsylvania\r\n  Farmer_,’ may be said to have sown the seeds of the revolution.”\r\n\r\n  From the commencement of the momentous controversy between the\r\n  North-American colonies and the parent state, Mr. Dickinson was an\r\n  able and strenuous assertor of the rights of the colonists. In the\r\n  summer of the year 1768, the Rev. Mr. Barton sent him a little\r\n  artificial fountain or jet-d’eau, called a perpetual fountain,\r\n  prettily contrived and ornamented. On that occasion, the patriotic\r\n  feelings of Mr. Dickinson were thus expressed, in an handsome allusion\r\n  to this engine; feelings, called forth by some sentiments contained in\r\n  the letter which accompanied this small present,—“I wish” (said he, in\r\n  his answer to Mr. Barton’s letter, dated the 29th of August,)—“I wish\r\n  ‘a perpetual fountain’ may water the tree of American liberty—I shall\r\n  always be ready and willing, with pious hands, to sprinkle its roots;\r\n  even though, for every drop of the pure element I throw upon them, the\r\n  free-booters should pour upon me all the foul waters in which they\r\n  delight to dabble. I have acted from the best of motives, the love of\r\n  freedom and of my country. If reproaches can influence the weak and\r\n  malicious, they never can blot from my memory the pleasing\r\n  consciousness of having endeavoured to do my duty. I am extremely\r\n  sensible of my own frailties; and yet I think I have so much charity,\r\n  that I reflect with pleasure, that perhaps these very people who abuse\r\n  me, may derive some little advantage from those very actions of mine\r\n  for which they abuse me. May heaven grant this to be the case! It is\r\n  all the revenge I desire to take of them; and this I think, my good\r\n  sir, is a Christian revenge.”\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Allen, Ross, and Biddle, shall be noticed in another place.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Sellers was a sensible and ingenious country-gentleman, possessed\r\n  of some skill in mathematical and astronomical science. Messrs. John\r\n  and Israel Jacobs (whose sister was the second wife of Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse) were also well-informed country-gentlemen: the former was\r\n  speaker of the general assembly of Pennsylvania, and the latter a\r\n  member of congress, after the revolution. Mr. James Wright was a very\r\n  respectable representative of the county of Lancaster, before the\r\n  revolution. The gentlemen named in the committee of the general\r\n  assembly, to treat with Mr. Rittenhouse for the purchase of an Orrery\r\n  for the use of the public, were likewise conspicuous for their worth.\r\n  Of these, Mr. Rhoads was one of the vice-presidents of the American\r\n  Philosophical Society, and Mr. Morton, a judge of the supreme court of\r\n  Pennsylvania, before the revolution: both were afterwards members of\r\n  congress.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe various agitations which the public mind underwent in this country,\r\nin the succeeding four years, in consequence of its disputes with the\r\nparent state, and until the commencement of hostilities between the two\r\ncountries, seem to place Mr. Rittenhouse more out of view for some time,\r\nwith respect to any public employments. Then, all classes of people\r\nappeared to have become Politicians. The interests of Literature were\r\nneglected; Science, abstracted from Politics, was little cultivated; and\r\nall other considerations were, in general, apparently absorbed in the\r\nviews which the American people entertained of their public affairs, and\r\nin the prosecution of measures, adapted either for the obtaining a\r\nredress of the then existing grievances, or to meet the possible\r\ncontingency of an adverse event. There was, in fact, for about four\r\nyears preceding the year 1775, a great interruption, sometimes an almost\r\ntotal suspension, in the American colonies of Great Britain, of all\r\npursuits, except the ordinary and indispensable ones of Industry and\r\nCommerce. Yet about the commencement of this period, (viz. in the summer\r\nof 1771,) Mr. Rittenhouse was engaged with Mr. Kinnersley and some other\r\ngentlemen, several days successively, in making a series of experiments\r\nat Philadelphia, on the Gymnotus Electricus, or Electric Eel; for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the nature of the faculty by which this fish is\r\nenabled, on being touched, to impart a shock, very similar in sensation\r\nto that produced by the electric fluid. An account of these experiments\r\nwas long afterwards communicated by Mr. Rittenhouse to Professor Barton\r\nof Philadelphia, and will be found in the first volume of his\r\n_Philadelphia Medical and Physical Journal_.\r\n\r\nIt was during this interval that Mr. Rittenhouse experienced a long\r\ncourse of exemption from any very conspicuous public employments, which\r\ncould interfere with his favourite studies; an interval, in which he was\r\ndisposed to have enjoyed a kind of dignified leisure, amidst the\r\ntranquillity of domestic employments; so far as the existing state of\r\nthings in the political world would permit a man, solicitous for his\r\ncountry’s happiness, to participate in any sort of gratification, that\r\nmight be deemed incompatible with a due degree of interest in the public\r\nweal. He possessed too enlightened and patriotic a mind not to be keenly\r\nsensible of the delicate, as well as alarming situation, in which his\r\ncountry was then placed. But nature had fitted him for the quiet station\r\nof domestic life, and the delightful pursuits of natural science; rather\r\nthan for the bustle of official situation, and for those speculative\r\nprojects in politics, wherein specious theories often terminate in the\r\nmost deceptive results.\r\n\r\nHe had been investigating principles founded in Truth, from his\r\nchildhood; this object was always near to his heart; and he set little\r\nvalue on any thing that did not lead to its attainment. This\r\npredominating disposition of his mind is indeed plainly evinced by a\r\nsingle sentence, contained in a letter which he addressed to Mr. Barton,\r\nso early as the 16th of February, 1764. Having had a personal interview\r\nwith an eminent and worthy clerical gentleman, well disposed to befriend\r\nhim, but who was more a metaphysical than a natural philosopher, he thus\r\nexpressed himself on the occasion: “I had a good deal of conversation\r\nwith Mr. ******, not, perhaps, greatly to the satisfaction of either of\r\nus; for he appears to me to be a Mystical Philosopher, and you know I\r\ncare not a farthing for any thing but sober Certainty in Philosophy.”\r\n\r\nFifteen years elapsed between the publication of the first and second\r\nvolumes of the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society; and\r\nthere is an interval of about ten years between the latest of Mr.\r\nRittenhouse’s communications, contained in the first volume, and the\r\nearliest in the second. These facts, alone, are sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate to what a state of depression all philosophical pursuits had\r\nsunk, not only during the war of the revolution, but for some years\r\npreceding it. It is true, that long before the close of that war, an\r\nattempt was made by a few individuals to revive the long interrupted\r\nmeetings of the Society, at the stated times of their convening; and\r\nthat, for this purpose, a Charter of Incorporation was granted to the\r\nmembers of that Institution, by an act of the Pennsylvania Legislature,\r\npassed the 15th of March 1780: but that act itself contains an\r\nacknowledgment of the truth, that, “The Society, after having been long\r\ninterrupted in their laudable pursuits by the calamities of war and the\r\ndistresses of our country,” had “found means to revive their\r\ndesign,”—“in hopes of being able to prosecute the same with their former\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\nBut, at the date of Mr. Rittenhouse’s letter to Mr. Barton, of the 3d of\r\nFebruary, 1772,[164] he appears to have been chiefly engaged in his\r\ndomestic concerns and professional employment. He remained, even then,\r\nvery sensible of the loss he had sustained in the death of his wife: and\r\nhis reflections on that circumstance, together with the serious aspect\r\nof the times and his frequent indisposition, depressed his mind,\r\noccasionally, much below its natural state of cheerfulness. It must have\r\nbeen in one of these hours of mental gloom, that he penned the\r\nsucceeding passage, in the letter last referred to.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  See Note 167.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt, my dear Brother, but that you condemn me, as usual, for\r\nnot writing: but much writing ill suits a Mechanic. After the\r\ncomfortless toil of the day, when evening comes, I am glad to sooth my\r\nmind with a favourite poet, or some other book of amusement. That you\r\nmay not be disappointed, I would have you to expect nothing of me, in\r\nfuture. I no longer feel any inducement to exert myself: every\r\nthing—even life itself—is insipid. Yet you will be told, I suppose, that\r\nI am paying my addresses to some one:—I sincerely wish sad experience\r\nmay never teach you to reconcile these contradictions.”\r\n\r\n“It is still my intention to go to England, as soon as my business will\r\npermit. I have had my health as well as usual, until the last fortnight;\r\nbut have now a violent cold.”\r\n\r\nThe tenor of this quotation manifests, that our Philosopher did not, at\r\nthat time, enjoy his accustomed serenity of mind. Some of the causes of\r\nhis depression of spirits appeared to his friend and correspondent to be\r\nof such a nature, as might, perhaps, be removed by a little pleasantry.\r\nUnder this impression, Mr. Barton, in his answer, thus rallied him:\r\n\r\n“I am extremely sorry,”—said this gentleman, after replying to some\r\nother parts of Mr. Rittenhouse’s letter—“to find your Ambition so low,\r\nas to render you indifferent to that _Fame_ to which you might justly\r\naspire; and your Spirits so sunk, as to put you out of humour with the\r\nworld. My dear Brother, what can this be owing to? You have, indeed,\r\nreceived a severe blow: but I am sure that your Philosophy has taught\r\nyou, with the Poet,—that,\r\n\r\n              “To be from all things that disquiet, free,\r\n              Is not consistent with Humanity.”\r\n\r\n“Your case is not singular;—nay, it is favourable in comparison with\r\nthat of thousands. Though you have been deprived of one comfort, yet\r\nmany have been continued to you; such as, a tolerable share of\r\nhealth—-your children—the means of subsistence—the esteem of your\r\nfriends—the applause of your countrymen, &c. &c. Banish therefore, I\r\nbeseech you, this serious sadness—these melancholy reflections; which,\r\nif _Dr. Cadogan_[165] is to be credited, must be more injurious to your\r\nhealth than any other cause can be.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  Dr. William Cadogan’s “Dissertation on the Gout and all Chronic\r\n  Diseases,” &c. made its appearance in America about that time; and the\r\n  Rev. Mr. Barton, who had long experienced an hereditary gouty\r\n  affection, then thought favourably of the Doctor’s general theory,\r\n  although he could not adopt that ingenious theorist’s doctrine,\r\n  denying the existence of any hereditary diseases.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“I know not, indeed, what kind of _Melancholy_ yours can be. To use the\r\nwords of the immortal Shakespeare,—\r\n\r\n          “You have neither the Scholar’s Melancholy,\r\n          Which is Emulation; nor the Musician’s,\r\n          Which is fantastical; nor the Courtier’s,\r\n          Which is Pride; nor the Lawyer’s, which is politic;\r\n          Nor the Lady’s, which is nice; nor the Lover’s,\r\n          Which is all these: but it is a Melancholy\r\n          Of your own,—compounded of many simples,\r\n          Extracted from many objects,—and, indeed,\r\n          The sundry Contemplation of the”——STARS.\r\n\r\n“If you will promise to pardon your saucy niece, I will tell you what\r\nshe attributes it to. She says you are _in Love_; and, really, you seem\r\nto insinuate as much, yourself: If it be so, I sincerely wish you\r\nsuccess in your “Addresses;” or a happy deliverance from the effects of\r\nLove.”\r\n\r\n“It would give me great pleasure to hear, that you had fairly resolved\r\nupon going to England;[166] because it would be the means not only of\r\ncheering your spirits, but of establishing your interest as well as\r\nreputation. You give me some hopes of seeing you soon: your Sister and I\r\nwould be extremely glad, indeed, to see you at Lancaster.[167]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Barton and some others of Mr. Rittenhouse’s friends had repeatedly\r\n  recommended to him to visit England: the former, particularly, often\r\n  urged him to it, and for the reasons assigned in the text. That he\r\n  had, himself, long contemplated that voyage, is apparent from the\r\n  extract of his letter to Mr. Barton, of the 15th of March 1771,\r\n  already quoted; and his last mentioned letter to the same gentleman\r\n  shews, that, nearly a year afterwards, he still had that object\r\n  steadily in view.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  In a preceding letter, Mr. Barton had sent him some Mathematical\r\n  Problems, for solution. These had been furnished by a schoolmaster, in\r\n  Mr. Barton’s neighbourhood; who, although reputed a pretty good\r\n  mathematician, possessed but a small share of genius or invention,\r\n  while he had a large portion of confidence in his own abilities. In\r\n  noticing these problems, Mr. Rittenhouse could not refrain from\r\n  shewing some little irritation: he thought the communications too\r\n  trifling, too destitute of originality, or too useless, to merit his\r\n  attention; and, accordingly, he thus expressed himself on the\r\n  occasion, in a letter dated Feb. 3, 1772:\r\n\r\n  “I entreat you not to insist on my measuring heads with any\r\n  pragmatical schoolmaster, who is heartily welcome, for me, to divert\r\n  himself with his _x. y. z’s_, at which he may be very expert, and yet\r\n  be, as you say, both ignorant and conceited. His first question,\r\n  however, may be answered by any young algebraist: the second and third\r\n  are more difficult, and will admit of various answers. The fourth\r\n  contains four observations, picked out, (and carelessly enough,\r\n  several of the figures being wrong,) of a set made on the comet of\r\n  1682, which I shewed your son William in about half a dozen different\r\n  books; you will find them in Dr. Halley’s Astronomical Tables. Every\r\n  thing relating to this comet has long ago been settled by Dr. Halley;\r\n  so that, to give a complete answer to the question, I need only\r\n  transcribe from him: but you cannot conceive how much I despise this\r\n  kind of juggle, where no use is proposed. If your schoolmaster will\r\n  give me but three good observations (I do not want four) of the comet\r\n  of 1769, I will accept them with thanks, and soon undertake the\r\n  laborious task of determining its orbit, which we yet know nothing\r\n  about.”\r\n\r\n  To this Mr. Barton replied, in a vein of good-humoured pleasantry:\r\n\r\n  “I imagine you have mistaken me, with regard to the mathematical\r\n  questions. They were not sent as trials of your abilities: but, for\r\n  reasons with which W. B. is acquainted, and which I have desired him\r\n  to give you, in order to afford you a laugh. I shalt never “insist” on\r\n  your “measuring heads” with a “schoolmaster,” of any kind; because I\r\n  know full well, already, that your head is longer than all the heads\r\n  of the whole tribe. Had you known what diversion your solutions would\r\n  have afforded me, you would have sent them.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAlthough no doubt can be entertained, that, in the early part of the\r\nyear 1772, Mr. Rittenhouse had it very seriously in contemplation to\r\nvisit England, as soon, to use his own words, as his business would\r\npermit, his intention in that particular was eventually frustrated: but\r\nit is now uncertain, to what cause was owing a change of his views or\r\nthe disappointment of his plan.[168] He married, however, in the month\r\nof December following, Miss Hannah Jacobs, of the city of\r\nPhiladelphia.[169]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  It is not improbable, that about the time of writing the letter of the\r\n  3d of Feb. 1772, from which extracts are given in the text, he began\r\n  to think seriously of marrying again. Both his natural disposition and\r\n  his habits endeared to him the comforts of domestic society; and these\r\n  he could not enjoy in a single state, his two only children being\r\n  infants. He therefore married, in December 1772; at which time he was\r\n  only in the forty-first year of his age. The lady he chose as his\r\n  companion, was a sensible, prudent and valuable woman; whose family\r\n  were members of the religious society of Friends, and with whose\r\n  brothers Mr. Rittenhouse had long been intimately acquainted. By that\r\n  marriage there was but one child, a daughter, who died in her infancy.\r\n  Mrs. Rittenhouse survived her husband little more than three years.\r\n  She died in October, 1799.\r\n\r\nFootnote 169:\r\n\r\n  See the preceding note.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBy an act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, passed the 26th of\r\nFebruary, 1773, Mr. Rittenhouse was appointed one of the Commissioners\r\nfor making the river Schuylkill navigable;[170] and by two subsequent\r\nlaws, passed on the 24th of March, 1781, and the 15th of March, 1784, he\r\nwas again appointed a Commissioner, at those two periods, for the same\r\npurpose. And by a list of the incidental expences of the government, for\r\nthe first mentioned of those years, it appears that he received 41_l._\r\n15_s._ 11_d._ for his services in that business. In these several\r\nappointments of commissioners, during a term of eleven years, Mr.\r\nRittenhouse was uniformly first-named; and, consequently, became\r\npresident of their board.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 170:\r\n\r\n  The first law of Pennsylvania, for removing rocks, sandbars and\r\n  gravel, from the bed of the river Schuylkill, so as to render it\r\n  passable with rafts, boats, and other small river-craft, was passed\r\n  the 14th of March 1761.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe last important business of a public nature, in which Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nwas engaged, prior to the American war, was in fixing, jointly with a\r\nCommissioner on the part of New-York, the beginning of the 43° of North\r\nlatitude, and to establish a Line, thence Westward, as the Boundary\r\nbetween Pennsylvania and New-York.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse was appointed the Commissioner for this purpose, on the\r\npart of the then province of Pennsylvania, by Gov. John Penn, on the\r\n24th of October, 1774; and Samuel Holland, Esquire, was the Commissioner\r\non the part of New-York, appointed by Lieutenant-Governor Colden. As\r\nCaptain Holland’s[171] commission was not made out until the 8th of\r\nNovember, these Joint-Commissioners could not proceed on the business of\r\ntheir appointment, before that late period. It appears, however, by the\r\nduplicate returns made by these gentlemen to their respective\r\ngovernments, under the date of December the 14th in the same year, that\r\nthey “ascertained and fixed the beginning of the forty-third degree of\r\nNorth latitude on the Mohawk or Western branch of the Delaware; and\r\nthere, in a small island of the said river, planted a stone, marked,\r\n&c.”[172]—“but that the rigour of the season prevented them from\r\nproceeding further in running the said line, &c.”[173]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 171:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Holland was an able engineer in the British service, and held the\r\n  military rank of captain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n    The Marks, &c. are particularly described in the Pennsylvania Act of\r\n    Assembly, passed the 29th of Sept. 1779, entitled “An Act to\r\n    establish and confirm the Boundary Line between this state and the\r\n    state of New-York.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n    The Law, referred to in the preceding note, states the extent of\r\n    their further progress in the business at that time, which was\r\n    inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  In September 1772, the Philosophical Society announced in the public\r\n  prints, the receipt, by them, of sundry communications: among which\r\n  were various astronomical observations, made in Canada, by this\r\n  gentleman and two other military officers, from June 1765, to May\r\n  1770, (captain Holland being, at that period, surveyor-general of the\r\n  district of Quebec.) These observations were communicated to the\r\n  society by Mr. Rittenhouse; but, having been received after the first\r\n  volume of the Society’s Transactions was published, their publication\r\n  in the subsequent volumes was by some means omitted.\r\n\r\nThis Line remained thus unsettled, until after the conclusion of the\r\nAmerican war. Mr. Rittenhouse and Captain Holland having previously\r\nestablished the North-Eastern Corner of Pennsylvania, on that boundary,\r\nby ascertaining and marking thereon the beginning of the 43° of North\r\nlatitude, the Pennsylvania Legislature, on the 31st of March, 1785,\r\nenacted a law, authorizing the Executive of the State to appoint a\r\nCommissioner, in conjunction with one or more on the part of New-York,\r\nto run and complete the Line. The person selected for this service by\r\nPennsylvania, in addition to Mr. Rittenhouse, was Andrew Ellicott, Esq.\r\nan able Mathematician and Astronomer, and well qualified also, by his\r\npractical knowledge of Surveying or Land-Mensuration: this gentleman was\r\naccordingly commissioned[174] by the hon. Charles Biddle, Esquire, then\r\nVice-President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, on the\r\n16th of June, 1786.[175] The Commissioners on the part of New-York, were\r\nJames Clinton and Simeon De Witt, Esquires: And by these gentlemen,\r\nappointed on behalf of their respective governments, this business was\r\nprosecuted; but it was not then completed.[176]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  Although Mr. Ellicott’s commission bears date the 16th of June, 1786,\r\n  his appointment took place some months sooner. On the 3d of April, in\r\n  that year, Mr. Rittenhouse wrote him thus:—\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      “By direction of Council” (the Supreme Executive Council of\r\n  Pennsylvania,) “I wrote some time ago to the gentlemen appointed by\r\n  the state of New-York for running the northern boundary of this state.\r\n  I have received their answer; which is, that they will meet us at\r\n  Philadelphia on the 20th of this month, in order to concert measures\r\n  for carrying that business into execution. It will be necessary for\r\n  you to attend, and I shall confidently expect you—’till then, I must\r\n  defer many things I have to say to and settle with you: perhaps\r\n  copying the Nautical Almanack may wait until I see you. Hurry of\r\n  business will not permit me add more, than that I am,\r\n\r\n                                         Dear Sir,\r\n                                           Your very humble serv’t.\r\n                                                      DAV. RITTENHOUSE.”\r\n\r\n  “ANDREW ELLICOTT, Esq.\r\n      Baltimore.”\r\n\r\n  And on the 29th of September, in the succeeding year, he addressed\r\n  another letter on the subject of this boundary, to Messrs. Ellicott\r\n  and Porter, jointly; wherein he says:\r\n\r\n  “Your packet came safe to hand, about three weeks after the date of\r\n  the letters. I am much obliged to you for the intelligence it\r\n  contains; you have succeeded beyond my expectation, and I have no\r\n  longer any doubt of your completing the line this season. I should\r\n  have been glad, if, to the account of your work, you had added some\r\n  description of the country: but my curiosity must wait till your\r\n  return.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse continued in commission, for the establishing of this\r\n  line, until its entire completion: but his non-attendance with the\r\n  other commissioners in the actual running of the line, in the year\r\n  1787, was prevented by his being then engaged in fixing the\r\n  territorial boundary between the states of Massachusetts and New-York.\r\n  In the letter, last quoted, is this paragraph:—“Dr. Ewing and myself\r\n  were absent seven weeks, on the line between New-York and\r\n  Massachusetts, in which time we happily completed it, to the\r\n  satisfaction of all parties; and, with this business, I have bid\r\n  adieu, forever, to all running of lines.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rush has been led into a mere mistake of the date on this\r\n  occasion; probably, by an hasty perusal of the confirmatory law, of\r\n  Sept. 29, 1789. He states, in his eulogium, that it was the year 1786,\r\n  in which Mr. Rittenhouse “was employed in fixing the northern line\r\n  which divides Pennsylvania from New-York: his services on that\r\n  business were originally employed in 1774, He did, indeed, again act\r\n  as a commissioner, in the year 1786, and it was on the 16th day of\r\n  June, in that year, that Mr. Ellicott was commissioned to complete, in\r\n  conjunction with Mr. Rittenhouse, what the latter had begun to execute\r\n  eleven years and an half before the last mentioned date.\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:\r\n\r\n  “In order to carry on the parallel of latitude with as much expedition\r\n  and economy as possible,” says Mr. Ellicott, “we dispensed with the\r\n  method of tracing a line on the arc of a great circle, and correcting\r\n  into the parallel; as pursued by Messrs. Mason and Dixon, in\r\n  determining the boundary between this state” (Pennsylvania,) “and the\r\n  state of Maryland, and which we followed in completing their line in\r\n  the year 1784. We commenced our operations by running a guide-line,\r\n  West, with a surveying compass, from the point mentioned on the\r\n  Delaware” (the one which was fixed by Dr. Rittenhouse and Capt.\r\n  Holland, in the year 1774,) 20¼ miles; and there corrected by the\r\n  following zenith lines” (laid down in the sequel,) “taken, at its\r\n  western termination, by a most excellent Sector, constructed and\r\n  executed by Dr. Rittenhouse.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe following letter, addressed by Mr. Rittenhouse to his wife, while he\r\nwas engaged in this service, will not only furnish the reader with some\r\nidea of the manner in which the commissioners, with their attendants,\r\nwere obliged to live in the wilderness, and the nature of their\r\naccommodations; but it will also present him with an interesting little\r\nstory, illustrative of the manners and condition, in our day, of some of\r\nthat unfortunate race of men, who were once the independent lords of\r\nthat vast territory, over which the descendants of a grant transatlantic\r\npeople now exercise all the rights of sovereignty and ownership. This\r\nletter is dated the 6th of August, 1786.\r\n\r\n“It is,” says Mr. Rittenhouse, “six long weeks since I have had the\r\nhappiness of seeing you or hearing from you; and this is the first\r\nopportunity I have had of conveying a letter to you, since I left\r\nWyoming. As I cannot hope to receive a line from you until we approach\r\nnearer to the habitable world, my next greatest pleasure is to inform\r\nyou of the favourable state of my health: this pleasure is indeed damped\r\nin some degree, by my fears that you will not give full credit to what I\r\nsay, though I mean to abide strictly by the truth. The head-ach has been\r\nunknown to me, almost ever since I left you; my cough, though much\r\nbetter, is not quite removed; and I have no other complaint, except,\r\nthat which will never leave me in this world: this, however, far from\r\nbeing worse than usual, is certainly something less troublesome; which I\r\nattribute to my being more at liberty to use moderate exercise, and less\r\nexposed to summer heats than I should be at home. This seems to be a\r\ndifferent climate from that you are in; the weather is constantly cool,\r\nbut not cold. We are at present situated on a pleasant bank of the\r\nSusquehanna, about fifteen miles above the mouth of the Chenango, one of\r\nthe principal branches of this river. From this place to Middletown in\r\nLancaster county, is, by estimation, 270 miles along the river: much of\r\nthe road is very bad, so that we had a tedious journey.\r\n\r\n“At Chenango, there are a few Indian families settled, amounting to\r\nforty souls. Some of these people frequently visit us, and bring us fish\r\nand venison; in return for which, they are very desirous to have flour\r\nor salted provisions: and we live in the greatest harmony with them.\r\nFive or six days ago, one of the Onondago Sachems with his family came\r\nup in three canoes, and encamped in the evening, just below us. Next\r\nmorning, we received a message from them, requesting an audience for two\r\nyoung ladies of the family. To this, a proper answer was returned,\r\n(General Clinton having prudently brought an interpreter with him,) and\r\nat the time appointed they were introduced to us in our tent, unattended\r\nby any other Indians. After a draught of punch, and a decent silence,\r\nour visitors were told that we were ready to hear what they had to say.\r\nThe eldest of the two, a fine girl of about twenty, and extremely well\r\ndressed, with a becoming modesty made a short speech; concluding with an\r\nhandsome apology for acquitting herself no better, on account of her\r\nyouth and sex. The purport of her speech was, that thinking it would not\r\nbe disagreeable to us, they were come to spend a few days in our\r\ncompany: that they were poor, and in want of provisions, especially\r\nflour; and hoped we would furnish them with a small portion of our\r\nstores,—at least for present use, whilst they staid with us. We\r\nencouraged them to bring us fish and other fresh provision; in return\r\nfor which, they should have salt meat and some bread. Business being\r\nover, some cheerful conversation ensued: and we had reason to think our\r\ninterpreter went much further than he was warranted to do; for he made\r\nsome proposition which the young lady negatived strongly, though we are\r\nignorant of what it was. He was then bid to assure them, that no insult\r\nshould be offered, and that they might visit us at our tents whenever\r\nthey pleased: to this one gentleman added, that we would treat them as\r\nwe would our own country women.\r\n\r\n“It seems the old interpreter mistook the word _treat_, and construed\r\nit, the _giving them victual and drink_: in consequence of this mistake,\r\nthe ladies expected to dine with us every day. They then departed,\r\nseeming well satisfied; but in the afternoon we received a message from\r\nthem, complaining that we had already broken the treaty, in not sending\r\nfor them to dinner. To this we sent a verbal answer, with an apology,\r\nand letting the ladies know we should expect them to tea. To my great\r\nsurprise, we then received a written note, thanking us for our kindness\r\nand promising to drink tea with us,—signed, _Jacowe and Sally_: it was\r\nin the Indian language, and written by Miss Sally herself. We now\r\nthought it our duty to return a written compliment likewise; and this\r\nintercourse ended with a verbal message from Miss Sally, assuring us,\r\nthat she thought herself honoured by our letter and would carefully\r\npreserve it. The ladies did not fail to come; and have drank tea every\r\nday, and sometimes dined with us. They are cheerful and agreeable; but\r\ncannot, or will not, speak one word of English. Mr. De Witt draws\r\nprettily, and is taking a very good picture of the young princess, which\r\nI hope to have the pleasure of shewing you in a few weeks. I have\r\nmentioned their _writing_, which you will be surprised at: but these\r\nIndians are in some measure civilized; many of them have learned to\r\nread;—they have the Common Prayer Book of the Church, printed in their\r\nown language, which is the Mohawk.[177] The family now with us have\r\nseveral books with them; likewise paper, pens and ink. Every evening,\r\nthe females jointly sing several religious hymns, and their music is at\r\nleast equal to any of this kind I have heard: the old mistress is very\r\ndevout, and sometimes says her prayers with great fervency. They are,\r\nnevertheless, still but Indians; and Miss Sally will sit, with all her\r\nfinery about her, flat on the ground for hours together, under a\r\nmiserable bark shed, making buckskin shoes, until her eyes are almost\r\nsmoked blind; then, by way of relaxation, she and her cousin will step\r\ninto a little tottering canoe, where, standing upright, they row away\r\nwith incredible swiftness.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  The Liturgy of the Church of England was first translated into the\r\n  Mohawk language, in the year 1714. Another translation was made under\r\n  the direction of three clergymen of that church; namely, the Rev. Mr.\r\n  William Andrews, Dr. Henry Barclay, and Dr. John Ogilvie: This was\r\n  printed in the year 1769; but the place where it was printed does not\r\n  appear. In the year 1787, an handsome edition of the English Book of\r\n  Common Prayer, with a translation into the Mohawk language by captain\r\n  Joseph Brant, was published in London.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“You will excuse me for entertaining you so long with an account of\r\nthese poor wretches. But your news, and your politics, are almost\r\nforgotten. Still, my principal happiness is, that not only waking but\r\nfrequently in my dreams, I feel all that esteem and affection for you,\r\nwhich I hope will never end. My companions are agreeable enough; but as\r\nevery one has his own humours, it is by no means a desirable thing to be\r\ncooped up in a little tent, night and day, for weeks together, with any\r\none. I want something to employ my leisure hours. This I could do by\r\nwriting, but here is no privacy: I am at present obliged to write badly\r\nand in a small hand, to prevent its being overlooked. I cannot think of\r\ntaking my departure for Philadelphia, until we approach nearer the\r\ninhabited country: our next station, but one, will be at or near Tioga,\r\nand from thence I shall return.”\r\n\r\n             *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n“God grant you health and spirits,” &c.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\nIn 1787, Mr. Ellicott’s associates, in completing this line, were Col.\r\nAndrew Porter of Pennsylvania, and Abraham Hardenberg and William\r\nMorris, Esquires, of New York; Mr. Rittenhouse, who was engaged the same\r\nyear in a similar occupation, being unable to attend the finishing of\r\nthis boundary. It was then finally run and marked, by the other\r\ncommissioners here named; and, in conformity to the return of these\r\ncommissioners, their proceedings were ratified by a confirmatory law of\r\nPennsylvania, passed on the 29th of September, 1789.\r\n\r\nThus did the labours of a great work,—of one which employed the talents\r\nof Mr. Rittenhouse towards the close of the year 1774—which were resumed\r\nby him in 1786, and were afterwards continued and completed by Mr.\r\nEllicott and his associates,—receive the legislative sanction of\r\nPennsylvania, fifteen years after the commencement of this arduous\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nHis studious habits, and zealous investigation of the works of nature,\r\nled Mr. Rittenhouse to devote as much of his time, as the delicate state\r\nof his health permitted him to retrench from occasional public\r\nemployments and his private occupations, to those objects for the\r\npromotion of which the American Philosophical Society was instituted.\r\nAfter he fixed his residence in Philadelphia, the established seat of\r\nthat Society, he attended their Meetings pretty regularly; and by that\r\nmeans had an opportunity of forming a more intimate acquaintance with\r\nmany persons, most conspicuous, at that time, for talents, knowledge,\r\nand learning. His great abilities had then become almost universally\r\nknown; and these, in connexion with the suavity of his deportment, his\r\ngreat modesty, and exemplary moral character, had not only procured him\r\nthe esteem and respect of all good men; but confirmed the friendship of\r\nhis old acquaintances, and attached to him the high and sincere regard\r\nof many new ones.\r\n\r\nAs one instance, among many, of the distinguished estimation in which\r\nMr. Rittenhouse was held by his fellow-citizens, after a residence of\r\nbetween four and five years in Philadelphia; the American Philosophical\r\nSociety petitioned the legislature, on the 6th of March, 1775, fer\r\npecuniary aid, to enable them to erect an Observatory; and to allow Mr.\r\nRittenhouse an annual salary, as the “Public Astronomical Observer.”\r\n\r\nThe objects of this application were important, in a public view; and\r\nits whole tenor was alike honourable to the enlightened patriotism of\r\nthe Philosophical Society, and the merit of the person to whom, more\r\nparticularly, it had reference.[178] Indeed, such a public act of so\r\nrespectable a body as that society, is a testimonial reflecting great\r\nhonour on the character of Mr. Rittenhouse; insomuch, that it would be\r\ndoing injustice to his memory, not to insert it in these Memoirs of of\r\nhis Life. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse is not mentioned in the petition, by name. This was\r\n  unnecessary: for it was universally known, that it could apply to no\r\n  other person in America, so unquestionable and pointed are its\r\n  allusions to him; and that, perhaps, no other Astronomer then living,\r\n  so well merited the high encomiums on his philosophical abilities,\r\n  which it contains.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“To the honourable the Representatives of the Freemen of the province of\r\nPennsylvania, in General Assembly met:\r\n\r\n“The Representation and Petition of the American Philosophical Society,\r\nheld at Philadelphia, for promoting useful knowledge.\r\n\r\n  “Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n  “It must yield a sensible satisfaction to the good people of this\r\n  province, whom you represent, to find, that although it be among the\r\n  youngest of our American settlements, its reputation has risen high\r\n  among the sister colonies, and has extended even to the remotest part\r\n  of Europe, on account of our many public-spirited institutions, and\r\n  our rapid improvements in all useful arts. This satisfaction is also\r\n  greatly increased, when we consider, that notwithstanding these\r\n  institutions, through the necessity of the case, were generally\r\n  obliged to derive much of their first support from the benevolence of\r\n  individuals; yet a liberal spirit, for their encouragement and final\r\n  establishment, has gone forth among our Representatives, in proportion\r\n  to the increase of our provincial funds. And indeed the savings of\r\n  public money, after supplying the exigencies of the state, are never\r\n  more laudably directed, than towards the promoting whatever is useful\r\n  and ornamental in society.\r\n\r\n  “It is with unfeigned gratitude that your petitioners recollect the\r\n  repeated occasions you have given them, of acknowledging your bounty\r\n  and protection, in carrying on their designs ‘for the advancement of\r\n  useful knowledge;’ and it is their firm resolution never to abuse your\r\n  former indulgence, by any future unnecessary or unimportant\r\n  applications. By the means now in their own power, they hope, in\r\n  general, to be able to prosecute their plan; except so far as they may\r\n  sometimes find it incumbent on them humbly to suggest to you the\r\n  encouragement of useful inventions, and the patronizing undertakings\r\n  beneficial to the whole community: And it is in this last view, that\r\n  they presume to address you at this time.\r\n\r\n  “Amidst the variety of fields, which, in this new world, lie open to\r\n  the investigation of your petitioners, they have, for several years,\r\n  turned their views towards one, wherein they hope to gather some of\r\n  their chief laurels, and to make discoveries alike honourable to their\r\n  country and themselves. Our distance from the chief Observatories in\r\n  the world, the purity and serenity of our atmosphere, invite us, nay\r\n  loudly call upon us, to institute a series of regular Astronomical\r\n  Observations; the comparison of which with those made in Europe, and\r\n  elsewhere, might settle some very important points, and contribute\r\n  greatly to give a last perfection to Geography and Navigation. The\r\n  advantages derived to those noble and useful sciences, from such\r\n  observations, are so obvious, that there is scarce a civilized nation\r\n  in the world that has not made some provision for prosecuting them;\r\n  and your petitioners have been honoured with repeated solicitations\r\n  from some of the greatest men in Europe, to join with them in this\r\n  great work, and in a mutual communication of our labours.\r\n\r\n  “It would be inexcusable, therefore, in your petitioners to neglect\r\n  the present opportunity of endeavouring to set such a design on foot,\r\n  when we have a Gentleman among us, whose Abilities, speculative as\r\n  well as practical, would do Honour to any Country, and who is,\r\n  nevertheless, indebted for bread to his daily toil, in an occupation\r\n  the most unfriendly both to health and study. Under his auspices, the\r\n  work may now be undertaken with the greatest advantages; and others\r\n  may be bred up by him, to prosecute it in future times: but if the\r\n  present opportunity is neglected, perhaps whole centuries may not\r\n  afford such another. To rescue such a Man from the drudgery of manual\r\n  labour, and give him an occasion of indulging his bent of genius, with\r\n  advantage to his Country, is an Honour which crowned heads might glory\r\n  in,—but it is an Honour also, which it is hoped, in the case of a\r\n  native, Pennsylvania would not yield to the greatest prince or people\r\n  on earth!\r\n\r\n  “The design, which your petitioners have projected, and now humbly beg\r\n  leave to lay before your honourable House, is as follows, viz.\r\n\r\n  “First, That the Honourable Proprietaries be petitioned to grant a Lot\r\n  of Ground, for erecting a Public Observatory, and to give such other\r\n  encouragement to the design as they may think proper. And from their\r\n  known attachment to the interest of this country, as well as their\r\n  professed readiness to serve the Gentleman who is proposed to conduct\r\n  the design, your petitioners cannot have any doubt of their kind\r\n  compliance with this humble request.\r\n\r\n  “Secondly, That the assistance of your honourable House be requested,\r\n  agreeably to the concluding prayer of this petition.\r\n\r\n  “Thirdly, That a subscription be promoted for erecting a Public\r\n  Observatory, and furnishing it with such instruments as may be wanted,\r\n  in addition to those valuable ones now in the province. Of the success\r\n  of this subscription among our benevolent fellow-citizens, there can\r\n  be no doubt; and the expense of the additional instruments will not be\r\n  great, as the Gentleman proposed to conduct the design, is capable of\r\n  constructing them all with his own hand, in the most masterly manner.\r\n\r\n  “Fourthly, That the Observatory shall be at all times open to the\r\n  curious; and, particularly, that captains and mates of vessels, and\r\n  young gentlemen desirous of obtaining a practical knowledge in\r\n  Astronomy, shall have admittance, and (under proper rules, to be\r\n  framed for that purpose,) be taught the use of Instruments, and the\r\n  method of making Observations, especially the _new method_ of\r\n  ascertaining the longitude at sea; for the perfecting of which, the\r\n  Parliament of Great Britain has of late given such ample rewards, to\r\n  the singular advantage of trade and navigation.\r\n\r\n  “Fifthly, That the Observations to be made by the Public Observer,\r\n  shall be annually published, under the inspection of the American\r\n  Philosophical Society, and communicated to the learned Societies in\r\n  Europe, with such remarks as may render them generally useful and\r\n  entertaining.\r\n\r\n  “Sixthly, That the same person might also be appointed Surveyor of the\r\n  high roads and waters; in order that when any public proposals are to\r\n  be made, for improving navigation, and shortening the communications\r\n  between capital trading places, there be always a person who has\r\n  leisure, and is skilled in measuring and reducing distances, taking\r\n  heights and levels, and who may be employed in conjunction with\r\n  others, when necessary, to make report on all such matters, either at\r\n  the expence of those who request such service, or at the public\r\n  expence, as the case may require.\r\n\r\n  “Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray, that your Honourable House\r\n  would take the premises into your consideration, and allow a yearly\r\n  salary for such person, at least as a Public Astronomer, if you should\r\n  not view the additional office of Surveyor of the high roads and\r\n  waters in the same important light as it is viewed by your\r\n  petitionors; and they further pray, that you would give them leave to\r\n  bring in a bill for the legislative appointment of such Public\r\n  Observer, and for regulating his duty in the execution of his trust:\r\n  and your petitioners shall ever pray, &c.\r\n\r\n    Signed in behalf and by order of the American Philosophical Society,\r\n    at Philadelphia, March 6th 1775.\r\n\r\n                                                THOMAS BOND, V. P.”[179]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  Joseph Galloway and Samuel Rhoads, Esq’rs. the other vice-presidents\r\n  of the society, were then members of the general assembly; and Dr.\r\n  Franklin, the president, had not at that time returned from England.\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse was, at the same time, one of the curators of the\r\n  society; as he was, also, during the year 1772.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNothing was done, in pursuance of this application to the legislature;\r\nalthough there is not any reason whatever to doubt, that there was the\r\nmost favourable disposition in that enlightened and liberal assembly, to\r\npromote the laudable views of the Philosophical Society, both as they\r\nregarded the public interest, and the personal advantage of Mr.\r\nRittenhouse. But the period was then close at hand, and its arrival had\r\nbeen for some time before anticipated, when the public voice was\r\nexpected to proclaim, in a tone of awful solemnity, “_Cedant Armis\r\nTogæ_:” and, in fact, the calamatous appeal to arms which soon after\r\nsucceeded, seemed almost wholly to absorb all other considerations, than\r\nsuch as were connected with the defence of the country and a new\r\norganization of its internal polity.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse was among those, who early yielded to the call of their\r\nfellow-citizens to serve them in a civil capacity. Dr. Franklin and\r\nMajor (afterwards General) Mifflin had been respectively appointed by\r\nthe continental congress, in the year 1775, to be post-master general of\r\n“the United Colonies of North-America,” and quartermaster-general of the\r\nAmerican army: and, in consequence of these appointments, both these\r\ngentlemen resigned, in the early part of the ensuing year, the seats\r\nthey had occupied in the general assembly of Pennsylvania, as burgesses\r\nfor the city of Philadelphia. To supply this vacancy in the\r\nrepresentation of that city, Colonel (afterwards General) Joseph Reed\r\nand David Rittenhouse, Esq. were elected, in March 1776. Mr. Rittenhouse\r\ntook his seat on the 5th day of the same month, and continued an useful\r\nmember of that body until the termination of its legislative functions.\r\nBut, although he was a valuable and highly respectable member of that\r\nhouse, he did not possess that species of talent which often enables a\r\nman of even moderate abilities, to make a prominent figure in popular\r\nassemblies: his perception was extremely quick; in deliberative powers\r\nhe excelled; and all his reasoning faculties were most accurate: yet, an\r\ninsuperable native diffidence—pursuits which precluded opportunities of\r\npublic speaking—and, perhaps, a peculiar structure of his mind—all\r\nforbad his being an orator.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the agitating and highly important public events which\r\noccupied men’s minds, in the memorable year 1776, Mr. Rittenhouse could\r\nnot entirely abandon, even then, his darling pursuits. His ardent\r\nattachment to the Newtonian philosophy led him, on various occasions, to\r\nvindicate it against new-fangled theories which sometimes appeared\r\nagainst it: for there still remained a few speculative men, and, among\r\nthese, some persons of considerable learning, who continued to adhere to\r\nthe visionary principles of Descartes and his followers.[180] Of this,\r\nan instance occurred in the year 1776. A writer under the signature of\r\nM. W. (and who is supposed to have been the late Rev. Matthew Wilson, a\r\nrespectable presbyterian clergyman, of Lewes,[181] in the county of\r\nSussex on Delaware,) published in _The Pennsylvania Magazine_, for March\r\nand April in that year, (conducted by the late Mr. Robert Aitken of\r\nPhiladelphia,) some speculations, under the head of “A proposal for\r\nreducing Natural Philosophy to a System, with Remarks on the Cartesian\r\nand Newtonian Theories.” In his lucubrations, this writer discovered a\r\ndecided partiality for the doctrine of Descartes, in preference to those\r\nof Newton. Nor did this admirer of the justly exploded philosophy of the\r\nformer long want a coadjutor: for, in the same Magazine, for the\r\nsucceeding month, appeared another reverend gentleman of the same\r\nreligious persuasion, and known to possess a copious fund of scholastic\r\nlearning; who, under the signature of J. W. approved, in the main, of\r\nthe opinions of his precursor, on this occasion. After acknowledging\r\nthat the Newtonian system prevailed universally in Great Britain, and\r\npretty generally throughout the rest of Europe, he asks—“Shall we then\r\nhear any thing against the Newtonian principles, in Answer?” He adds—“I\r\nanswer, yes.” After rendering a constrained kind of compliment to the\r\ngreat Newton, for his “inexpressible service to Philosophy”—“so far as\r\nhe adhered to his own plan,”—he proceeds with introducing “A few\r\nThoughts on Space, Dimension, and the Divisibility of Matters _in\r\ninfinitum_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  That eminent mathematician and astronomer, Mr. Roger Cotes,[180a] in\r\n  an excellent preface to his edition of Sir Isaac Newton’s _Mathematica\r\n  Principia Philosophiæ Naturalis_, has explained the true method of\r\n  philosophising; shewn the foundation on which the Newtonian system was\r\n  built; and refuted the objections of the Cartesians, and all other\r\n  philosophers, against it. In this preface, Mr. Cotes has ably answered\r\n  those, who contended, that gravity or attraction, in the system of\r\n  Newton, was not a clearer principle, nor one more fit to explain the\r\n  phænomena of nature, than the occult qualities of the peripatetics:\r\n  for, there were still philosophers, such as they were, who persisted\r\n  in that absurd opinion! “Gravity,” said the objectors, “is an occult\r\n  cause; and occult causes have nothing to do with true philosophy.” To\r\n  which Mr. Cotes made this lucid reply:—“Occult causes are not those\r\n  whose existence is most clearly demonstrated by observation and\r\n  experiment; but those only whose existence is occult, fictitious, and\r\n  supported by no proofs. Gravity, therefore, can never be called an\r\n  occult cause of the planetary motions; since it has been demonstrated\r\n  from the phænomena, that this quality really exists. Those rather have\r\n  recourse to occult causes, who make vortices to govern the heavenly\r\n  motions; vortices, composed of a matter entirely fictitious, and\r\n  unknown to the senses. But, shall gravity therefore be called an\r\n  occult cause, because the cause of gravity is occult, and as yet\r\n  undiscovered? Let those who affirm this, beware of laying down a\r\n  principle which will serve to undermine the foundation of every system\r\n  of philosophy that can be established. For causes always proceed, by\r\n  an uninterrupted connexion, from those that are compound, to those\r\n  that are more simple; and when you shall have arrived at the most\r\n  simple, it will be impossible to proceed further. Of the most simple\r\n  cause, therefore, no mechanical solution can be given; for if there\r\n  could, it would not be the most simple. Will you then call these most\r\n  simple causes _occult_, and banish them from philosophy? You may so;\r\n  but you must banish at the same time the causes that are next to them,\r\n  and those again that depend upon the causes next to them, till\r\n  philosophy, at length, will be so thoroughly purged of causes, that\r\n  there will not be one left whereon to build it.”\r\n\r\n  The great doctrine of gravitation and attraction, the _substratum_ of\r\n  the Newtonian philosophy, is amply verified by numerous observations\r\n  and experiments. Whether that which constitutes the principle of\r\n  gravity be, in itself, an incorporeal or spiritual substance, or a\r\n  _materia subtilis_, some very subtile kind of ethereal fluid, is a\r\n  question which does not at all affect the actual existence of such a\r\n  power. “We know,” as is observed by a great astronomer[180b] of our\r\n  own time, “that all the bodies in our system are retained in their\r\n  courses by such a power” (the power of attraction.) “And,” he adds,\r\n  “it is a very singular instance of the unerring wisdom of the CREATOR,\r\n  that the law which this power observes is such, that notwithstanding\r\n  the mutual attractions of the bodies, the system will never fall into\r\n  ruin, but is capable of preserving itself to all eternity. “Moreover,”\r\n  continues the same profound writer, “the mutual attraction which takes\r\n  place between distant bodies could not, of itself, either produce\r\n  their motion about the sun, or the rotation about their axes: it\r\n  required an external impulse to operate in conjunction with it, to\r\n  produce these effects; an act, which nothing but the arm of\r\n  OMNIPOTENCE could accomplish.” “An invisible power pervades the whole\r\n  system, and preserves it. In the effects produced by man, we see the\r\n  operation of the cause; but “the ways of the ALMIGHTY are past finding\r\n  out.” “Hence,” says our author, “in whatever point of view we take a\r\n  survey of our system, we trace the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of the\r\n  CREATOR: his Power, in its formation; his Wisdom, in the simplicity of\r\n  the means to produce the ends; and his Goodness, in making those ends\r\n  subservient to our use and enjoyment. Thus we are led by our enquiries\r\n  into the structure of the universe, to the proofs of the existence and\r\n  attributes of a SUPREME BEING, who formed and directs the whole.\r\n  Arguments of this kind produce conviction which no sophistry can\r\n  confound. “Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.” Let not\r\n  therefore the ignorant declaim against those pursuits which direct us\r\n  to a knowledge of our CREATOR, and furnish us with unanswerable\r\n  arguments against the infidel and the atheist.”\r\n\r\n  But, to return more immediately to the doctrine of gravitation: Some\r\n  experiments had been made by M. Boguer and M. de la Condamine, so long\r\n  since as the year 1738, upon the Chimboraso in South-America, in order\r\n  to test the Newtonian theory of gravity, by examining the attraction\r\n  of mountains; and the result accorded with that theory. With a view,\r\n  however, to establish the principle more completely, the experiments\r\n  of Messrs. Boguer and Condamine having been made under so many\r\n  disadvantages, as rendered the result not sufficiently accurate to be\r\n  entirely depended on, similar experiments were made upon the Mountain\r\n  Schehallien in Scotland, by Dr. Maskelyne, at the request of the Royal\r\n  Society, and under the patronage of his sovereign, the present king,\r\n  who liberally undertook to defray the expenses. From observations of\r\n  ten stars near the zenith, he found the difference of latitudes of the\r\n  two stations on the opposite sides of the mountain to be 54″, 6; and\r\n  by a measurement of triangles, he ascertained the distance of the\r\n  parallels to be 4364, 4 feet, corresponding, in that latitude, to an\r\n  arc of the meridian of 42″, 94, which is 11″, 6 less than by\r\n  observation: its half therefore, 5″, 8, is the effect of the\r\n  attraction of the mountain; and from its magnitude, compared with the\r\n  bulk of the whole earth, Dr. Maskelyne computed the mean density of\r\n  the latter to be about double that of the mountain. “Thus,” to use the\r\n  words of Mr. Vince, “the doctrine of _Universal Gravitation_ is firmly\r\n  established.” The reader will find Dr. Maskelyne’s deductions from\r\n  this experiment, in Vince’s _Complete System of Astronomy_, vol. ii.\r\n  p. 100 and seq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180a:\r\n\r\n  This extraordinary man, who was the first Plumian professor of\r\n  astronomy and experimental philosophy at Cambridge, was born July 10,\r\n  1682, and died prematurely June 5, 1716.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180b:\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Mr. Vince, A. M. F. R. S. Plumian Professor of Astronomy and\r\n  Experimental Philosophy, in the University of Cambridge. See his\r\n  _Complete System of Astronomy_, vol. ii. p. 291.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  The essay signed M. W. is dated from that place.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMuch as Mr. Rittenhouse was averse to controversy of any kind, he could\r\nnot content himself without publicly pointing out one palpable fallacy,\r\namong the many mistakes which the last mentioned writer had fallen into:\r\nfor he did not notice the preceding production of ‘M. W.’ not deeming\r\nit, probably, worthy of his attention. Accordingly, having been shewn\r\n‘J. W.’s’ essay, with some remarks on it by his ingenious friend Mr.\r\nEllicott (then quite a young man,) Mr. Rittenhouse drew up some\r\nobservations, very concisely, on the errors of this Anti-Newtonian\r\nessayist. This piece will be found in the same periodical work, for June\r\n1776. Being addressed to Mr. Aitken, the publisher of the Magazine, our\r\nPhilosopher concludes his strictures thus: “I wish the gentleman would\r\nbe more cautious, for the future; as well on your own account as for the\r\nsake of your readers, some of whom may be misled by the weakest\r\nreasoning, on a subject which they do not understand[182] and I will\r\nventure to assure him, that the whole doctrine of Infinites, which he is\r\npleased to call a sophism, will not produce one contradiction in a\r\nmathematical head. Those of another cast[183] need not meddle with it,\r\nsince there is a sufficient variety of literary subjects to engage every\r\nman, according to the bent of his genius.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  In the beginning of these observations of Mr. Rittenhouse, on “J.\r\n  W.’s” piece, he says—“I am one of those who are ready to subscribe to\r\n  the general maxim, That perfection is not to be found in any thing\r\n  human; and therefore do not suppose the Newtonian philosophy to be so\r\n  perfect as not to admit of amendment: But I must confess, that almost\r\n  all the attempts to controvert that philosophy, which I have met with,\r\n  amount to nothing more than so many proofs, that those who made them\r\n  did not understand it. Of this kind, are the objections started by\r\n  your correspondent, J. W.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  Alluding, probably, to Metaphysicians; for, neither Mr. M. W. nor Dr.\r\n  J. W. was distinguished as a Mathematician.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA further proof of Mr. Rittenhouse’s unremitting attachment to the\r\ninterests of science, even “amidst the calamities of an unhappy war,”\r\nwill be found in the following circumstances; a written memorial of\r\nwhich, is preserved in the family of his friend, the late Dr. W. Smith.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d day of November, 1776, Mr. Rittenhouse was engaged, in the\r\ncity of Philadelphia, jointly with Dr. Smith and Mr. John Lukens, in\r\nobserving the transit of Mercury over the Sun, which appeared that day.\r\nOn the 9th of January, following, the Doctor and Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nemployed themselves at the same place, in like Observations on an\r\neclipse of the Sun, which then occurred. And, on the 24th of June, 1778,\r\njust one week after the evacuation of that city by the British army, the\r\nthree gentlemen here named, together with Mr. Owen Biddle, were busied\r\nin making observations, there, on another eclipse of the Sun. The\r\nresults of these several Observations, in the hand-writing of Dr. Smith,\r\nhaving been bound up by him with a copy of T. Mayer’s Lunar Tables, the\r\nwriter of these Memoirs was obligingly permitted by Mr. Charles Smith,\r\nthe Doctor’s son, to transcribe them, for publication in this work. A\r\ntrue copy of them is accordingly given in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to some political events of the year 1776: In the month\r\nof September of that year, Mr. Rittenhouse was one of twenty-four\r\npersons who were appointed justices of the peace, for the whole State of\r\nPennsylvania; in their capacity of members of the then existing council\r\nof safety.\r\n\r\nThis appointment was made by virtue of an ordinance of the convention of\r\nPennsylvania, which passed the first constitution of the state, on the\r\n28th of September, 1776, of which he was also a member, for the city of\r\nPhiladelphia. That convention could boast of possessing, among their\r\nmembers, two distinguished philosophers, Franklin[184] and Rittenhouse:\r\nbut it cannot be ascertained, whether the opinions of these two eminent\r\nmen, on the subject of government, had any decided influence on the\r\ndeliberations of that assembly. Certain it is, however, that the\r\nConstitution framed and promulgated by the convention, was predicated on\r\ntoo many new and untried principles of civil polity; that it contained\r\ntoo many aberrations from maxims founded on a knowledge of human nature,\r\nto have warranted a reasonable expectation, that it could long prove\r\npractically beneficial. Hence, after an experiment of fourteen years\r\ncontinuance, it was succeeded by the present constitution of the state;\r\none admirably well suited to secure the rights and liberties of its\r\ncitizens, individually, and to promote the prosperity of the whole\r\ncommunity, so long as it shall be faithfully and wisely\r\nadministered.[185]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Franklin was president of that convention.\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Ramsay, who published his History of the American Revolution at\r\n  the close of the year 1789, after observing that the policy of\r\n  Great-Britain, in throwing the inhabitants of her ancient colonies on\r\n  the American continent out of her protection, induced a necessity of\r\n  establishing independent constitutions for themselves, makes these\r\n  judicious remarks:—“The many errors that were at first committed by\r\n  unexperienced statesmen, have been a practical comment on the folly of\r\n  unbalanced constitutions and injudicious laws.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe thirteen British Colonies, which, on the memorable fourth day of\r\nJuly, 1776, had declared themselves free and independent States, assumed\r\nat the same time a national character, under the denomination of “The\r\nUnited States of America,” in the articles of confederation and\r\nperpetual union between the states, then published:[186] and by these\r\narticles it was agreed, that each state should retain its sovereignty,\r\nfreedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, not\r\nexpressly delegated to congress by the confederation. As soon,\r\ntherefore, as Pennsylvania had adopted her state-constitution, measures\r\nwere pursued for organizing her government, in conformity to its\r\nprovisions. The right of appointing the treasurer of the state by annual\r\nelection, was vested in the immediate representatives of the people,\r\nwhen assembled in their legislative capacity. This policy had been\r\ninvariably pursued in the proprietary government of Pennsylvania, while\r\nshe continued to be a British province: after the abrogation of the\r\nfirst constitution of the state, the same mode of appointing that\r\nimportant officer, the state-treasurer, was continued, and will probably\r\nlong remain a constitutional provision.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  The articles of confederation were not finally ratified by congress\r\n  until the 9th of July, 1778. “After eleven years experience,” as Dr.\r\n  Morse has observed, “being found inadequate to the purposes of a\r\n  federal government,” the present constitution of the United States was\r\n  formed at Philadelphia, in the summer of 1787, by that wise, liberal\r\n  and patriotic assembly, in which the illustrious Washington presided.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe person first appointed to that high trust, under the republican\r\ngovernment of Pennsylvania, was David Rittenhouse: a man whose stern\r\nintegrity, numerous public services, and uniform adherence to those\r\nprinciples which gave rise to the American revolution, were well\r\ncalculated to inspire a general confidence in his character; more\r\nespecially, in times when virtue and talents were considered as\r\nmeritorious qualities in public men, by those who elevated them to\r\noffice. The first legislative body of the State, after the declaration\r\nof independence, assembled at Philadelphia in October, 1776; and, on the\r\n14th day of January, in the following year, they chose Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nto be the state-treasurer, without a dissenting voice. In like manner,\r\nhe was unanimously continued in that station, during twelve succeeding\r\nyears; in the last of which, he sent to the legislature his resignation\r\nof that office: this event shall be more particularly noticed in its\r\nproper place in the order of time.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the possession of the city of Philadelphia by the\r\nBritish army, from the latter end of September, 1777, until the\r\nbeginning of the ensuing summer, the session of the state-legislature\r\nwhich intervened, was held at Lancaster. The compulsory removal from the\r\ncapital, not only of the government of Pennsylvania but of congress\r\nalso, and all the offices attached to the seat of the national\r\ngovernment, produced an high degree of agitation and resentment in the\r\npublic mind; more especially in Pennsylvania, where the evils occasioned\r\nby the occupancy of their capital by an hostile army, were more keenly\r\nfelt by the citizens.\r\n\r\nUnder these impressions, the general assembly of that state passed a law\r\non the 13th of October (only seventeen days after the British forces\r\nentered Philadelphia,) entitled “An act for constituting a council of\r\nsafety, &c.” By this act, twelve persons therein named, of whom David\r\nRittenhouse was one, were constituted that council: and to this body,\r\njointly with the supreme executive council of the state, great and\r\nextraordinary powers were given, to punish (even capitally) offenders,\r\n“traitors or others, who from their general conduct, or conversation,\r\nshould be deemed inimical to the common cause of liberty and the United\r\nStates of North-America.” The irritation, that could have provoked such\r\na measure, must have been extreme! for, surely, nothing less than an\r\nextremity of necessity could be urged as any sort of justification, in a\r\nfree country, of a legislative act, whereby the constitution was grossly\r\nviolated, laws were dispensed with, and a summary authority of the\r\nhighest nature, vested in a tribunal unknown to the laws and unwarranted\r\nby the constitution.[187] It is believed, however, that no proceedings\r\nwere had under this strange legislative act: and the writer is firmly\r\npersuaded, that neither Mr. Rittenhouse, nor some others of the\r\ngentlemen who constituted the tribunal erected by that act, would have\r\nundertaken to exercise some of the powers required of them, thereby.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  “War never fails,” as Dr. Ramsay has justly observed, “to injure the\r\n  morals of the people engaged in it. The American war in particular,”\r\n  continues that historian, “had an unhappy influence of this kind.\r\n  Being begun without funds or regular establishments, it could not be\r\n  carried on without violating private rights; and in its progress, it\r\n  involved a necessity for breaking solemn promises, and plighted public\r\n  faith. The failure of national justice, which was in some degree\r\n  unavoidable, increased the difficulties of performing private\r\n  engagements, and weakened that sensibility to the obligations of\r\n  public and private honour, which is a security for the punctual\r\n  performance of contracts.”\r\n\r\n  This is a melancholy but faithful representation of some of the\r\n  injurious impressions made on the moral sentiments and feelings of the\r\n  people of this country, by the revolutionary war: evils inseparable\r\n  from warfare; and such as necessarily spring from a state of things,\r\n  alike destructive of social order and the refinements of society, as\r\n  repugnant to the precepts of religion, the dictates of natural justice\r\n  and the mild suggestions of benevolence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDaring the occupancy of Philadelphia by the British forces under Sir\r\nWilliam Howe, the commander in chief, from the 26th of September, 1777,\r\nuntil the evacuation of that city on the 18th of June, in the following\r\nyear, Mr. Rittenhouse resided at Lancaster;[188] where he was busily\r\nemployed in the duties of his office of treasurer of the state.[189]\r\nBefore his removal from Philadelphia, he had placed his family at or in\r\nthe vicinity of his farm in Norriton, distant about twenty miles in a\r\nnorth-westwardly direction from the capital; then conceiving that\r\nsituation to be a place of safety from any hostile excursions. While he\r\nhimself continued in the borough of Lancaster, he made his home at the\r\nhouse of the late William Henry, Esq. at that time treasurer of the rich\r\nand populous county of the same name; a situation which was very\r\ncommodious for the business of his office, from its connexion with that\r\nof the county-treasurer, and one which was also rendered the more\r\nagreeable, by reason of Mr. Henry being a person of very considerable\r\nmechanical ingenuity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  This large and thriving borough, said to be the greatest inland town\r\n  in the United States, was, for a short time, (though very short,\r\n  indeed,) the seat, or rather place of refuge, of the American\r\n  congress; the members of which, having separated on the near approach\r\n  of the British army, eight days before their occupation of the\r\n  capital, re-assembled at Lancaster the 27th day of the same month.\r\n  Lancaster, which is situated at the distance of sixty-four miles from\r\n  Philadelphia, in a direction nearly west, was at first conceived to be\r\n  a place of safety: but, for their more perfect security, congress\r\n  convened, three days afterwards, at York in Pennsylvania, a\r\n  considerable county-town about twenty-two miles westward from\r\n  Lancaster, and from each of which places, the intervening great river\r\n  Susquehanna is about equidistant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  His active mind derived much of its happiness from its continual\r\n  employment. It appears, that, while engaged in the duties of his\r\n  office, at Lancaster, in the latter part of the year 1777, he made the\r\n  calculations for an Ephemeris, called “Father Abraham’s\r\n  Pocket-Almanack, for the year M.DCC LXXVIII;” the late Mr. John\r\n  Dunlap, the publisher, (who was, during many years, an eminent printer\r\n  in Philadelphia,) having, in his advertisement of it, announced to the\r\n  public, that “The Astronomical Calculations of this Almanack were\r\n  composed by David Rittenhouse, A. M.” Mr. A. Ellicott made\r\n  calculations for Pennsylvania and Maryland Almanacks, several years\r\n  after Mr. Rittenhouse declined to continue them.\r\n\r\n  It is believed that our Astronomer made the calculations for “Father\r\n  Abraham’s Almanack,” and probably some others, for several years: but\r\n  mostly in the earlier part of his life. And, as it was no\r\n  disparagement to the talents of a Franklin to publish “Poor Richard’s\r\n  Almanack,”[189a] (which the Doctor long continued to print,) so it was\r\n  none to the genius and abilities of a Rittenhouse, that he employed\r\n  himself, occasionally, in making calculations of an useful nature for\r\n  these Ephemerides.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189a:\r\n\r\n  Not only the astronomical calculations of this once well-known and\r\n  highly esteemed Ephemeris, but its poetry also, (which is said to have\r\n  possessed a considerable share of merit,) were the productions of\r\n  Jacob Taylor, Esq. an old English gentleman, who, for some time,\r\n  executed the office of Surveyor-General of Pennsylvania. Franklin was\r\n  the printer and publisher of this Ephemeris: but many of the\r\n  productions of his pen, which appeared in it, and, among the rest, his\r\n  “Way to Wealth,” contributed towards rendering it a very popular\r\n  publication, of its kind. Franklin commenced the publication of “Poor\r\n  Richard’s Almanack,” in the year 1732, when he was but twenty-six\r\n  years of age.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis separation of Mr. Rittenhouse from his wife and children—attended\r\ntoo, as it was, by the most embarrassing circumstances, and great\r\nuncertainty with respect to the extent of its continuance—produced, in\r\nsuch a disposition as his, the most poignant feelings. His lot, it is\r\ntrue, was that of thousands of his fellow-citizens: nor were the\r\nopposite party exempt from similar evils; many of whom were obliged to\r\nabandon their homes, and, after making great sacrifices, to seek an\r\nasylum among strangers. These were a part of the miseries inseparable\r\nfrom a state of war; and some of them were of that nature which\r\nnecessarily resulted from a war of so singular a character;\r\nconsiderations, however, which could not afford much alleviation to the\r\nanxious feelings of our Philosopher, in his exile: those sensations were\r\nin his mind, extremely acute; aggravated as they were, by the almost\r\nhopeless condition of his native country at that time.[190]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  “At no period of the war,” says chief-justice Marshall the historian,\r\n  “had the American army been reduced to a situation of greater peril,\r\n  than during the winter at Valley-Forge.” “More than once they were\r\n  absolutely without food. Even while their condition was less desperate\r\n  in this respect, their stock of provisions was so scanty, that there\r\n  was seldom at any time in the stores a quantity sufficient for the use\r\n  of the troops for one week. Consequently, had the enemy moved out in\r\n  force, the American army could not have continued in camp. The want of\r\n  provisions would have forced them out of it; and their deplorable\r\n  condition with respect to clothes, disabled them from keeping the\r\n  field in the winter. The returns of the first of February (1778)\r\n  exhibit the astonishing number of three thousand nine hundred and\r\n  eighty-nine men in camp unfit for duty, for want of clothes. Of this\r\n  number, scarcely a man had a pair of shoes. Even among those returned\r\n  capable of doing duty, very many were so badly clad, that exposure to\r\n  the colds of the season must have destroyed them. Although the total\r\n  of the army exceeded seventeen thousand men, the present effective\r\n  rank and file amounted to only five thousand and twelve. The returns\r\n  throughout the winter do not essentially vary from that which has just\r\n  been particularly stated.”\r\n\r\n  Such was the miserable condition of the American army, at the date of\r\n  the above returns! It was, indeed, sufficiently desperate in\r\n  appearance, to have appalled the stoutest heart; and it required the\r\n  magnanimity, as well as the virtue of a WASHINGTON, to conquer such\r\n  difficulties and rise superior to them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA letter which he wrote to his wife, from Lancaster, on the 26th of\r\nJanuary, 1778, strongly bespeaks his inquietude and distress, at that\r\nalarming period; and is, besides, so very expressive of his purity of\r\nheart and the delicacy of his conjugal and parental affections, that the\r\nfollowing extracts from it will, it is presumed, be strikingly\r\nindicative of his principles and temper.\r\n\r\n“One of your last,” says Mr. Rittenhouse to his wife, “convinces me,\r\nthat the fears I expressed in a former letter are well-founded; I mean,\r\nthat you will write, when writing is painful to you: Indeed, my dear H.\r\nI am not so unreasonable as to desire it.”—“Your letters, my dearest H.\r\ngive me mingled pleasure and pain. There is nothing in this world I\r\nvalue so much, as your esteem and affection: Your very kind expressions\r\nof regard, and concern for my health, would therefore make me happy, if\r\nit were not for our unfortunate situation. But we have long since talked\r\nof the necessity of reconciling ourselves to the prospect of a\r\nseparation,—perhaps for years: this, I fear, you have still made little\r\nprogress in doing, if I may judge from your letters. Nevertheless, the\r\ndismal prospect still continues. I cannot, indeed, boast of much more\r\nresolution myself. If providence has espoused the cause of our enemies,\r\nfor wise reasons unknown to us,—Heaven, nevertheless, is my witness,\r\nwith what integrity I have acted; and, that the virtue and happiness of\r\nmy fellow-creatures has always been my principal object. I am,\r\ntherefore, not at all distressed on my own account, confident of being\r\nhappy, in whatever part of the world my lot may be thrown: but how to\r\nleave you exposed to the frowns of fortune; to leave you to the mercy of\r\nan unfeeling world, rendered more callous by general distress; to leave\r\nyou thus, confiding only in the goodness of Providence, is what I have\r\nstill to learn. May kind Heaven render it unnecessary!\r\n\r\n“I shall perhaps, before I seal this, appoint a time to meet you. In my\r\nlast, I partly promised to come and stay a fortnight with you: but I do\r\nnot now think it so safe, as I did then. In our present situation, I\r\nshould not think it prudent to stay above one night with you, as parties\r\nof horse are employed to pick up particular persons. For this reason, I\r\nwould rather meet you at one of your brothers’, or at sister’s;[191] but\r\nI apprehend the Schuylkill is, at present, difficult—if not dangerous—to\r\ncross, on account of the ice.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:\r\n\r\n  This sister of Mrs. Rittenhouse was the widow of Colonel Caleb Parry,\r\n  a gallant officer in the American service, who was killed at the\r\n  battle of Long-Island in July, 1776.\r\n\r\n“Tuesday morning.—I am now nearly determined to appoint next Saturday\r\nweek, in the evening, to meet you at brother John’s;[192] and yet I fear\r\nit may expose one or both of us to a very uncomfortable ride. I will,\r\nhowever, be there, if the weather be tolerable and health permit; but do\r\nnot come, my dear H. if the weather should be bad; because if I do not\r\nfind you there, I shall proceed to brother Israel’s,[193] where I shall\r\nbe glad to find you on Sunday, in order to accompany you home. If you\r\ncan find any opportunity to write before then, I shall be glad to\r\nreceive a line.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  John Jacobs, Esq.—This gentleman was a brother of Mrs. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  Israel Jacobs, Esq.—Another brother of Mrs. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing the numerous and distressing privations incident to a\r\nnine months banishment from his home and separation from his\r\nfamily—during a period, too, of great calamity and suffering among his\r\ncountrymen, Mr. Rittenhouse most joyfully returned to Philadelphia, soon\r\nafter its abandonment by the hostile army; and there, once more, enjoyed\r\nthe solace of a reunion with his wife and children; amidst whose tender\r\nembraces, and the mutual congratulations of his friends and\r\nfellow-citizens, especially of the returning exiles, he participated\r\nlargely in those delightful sensations with which such an occasion, and\r\nsuch scenes, must have inspired a virtuous heart.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia, Mr. Rittenhouse resumed the discharge of his official\r\nfunctions, as treasurer of the state; an office, in the execution of\r\nwhich there were very numerous and complicated duties, arising out of\r\nthe novel system of finance and paper-credit, pursued by both the\r\ngeneral and state governments during the war: consequently, his\r\nattention to this business engrossed so much of his time, as to leave\r\nhim little leisure for pursuits more congenial to his mind.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time after Mr. Rittenhouse’s return to Philadelphia he\r\nreceived a letter from Mr. Jefferson, congratulating him on that happy\r\nevent: and expressing, in very forcible terms, the exalted sense that\r\ngentleman entertained of our Philosopher’s genius, talents, and\r\nusefulness. It indicates, also, the solicitude felt by its writer, lest\r\nthe Orrery of Mr. Rittenhouse’s invention and construction, belonging to\r\nthe College of Philadelphia, had been either removed or injured by the\r\nBritish forces, while they occupied that city. On this head, however,\r\nthe apprehensions conceived by Mr. Jefferson proved to be groundless:\r\nfor, not only was the Orrery not removed from its proper station; but,\r\nat the instance of the Rev. Dr. Smith, the provost of the College, the\r\napartment in the College edifice which contained the invaluable machine,\r\nwas closed up by order of Sir William Howe, to prevent its being\r\ninjured; and no person was permitted to enter that apartment to view the\r\nOrrery, without the Provost’s consent; on which occasions he uniformly\r\nattended in person, with the keys kept in his possession. The means thus\r\nused, to secure from any injury property so inestimable to the friends\r\nof science, is a circumstance that certainly reflects much honour upon\r\nthe parties by whom they were effected,—even though one of them was, at\r\nthat time, necessarily viewed in the character of an “enemy.”\r\n\r\nBut, in order that the reader may be enabled to form his own judgment,\r\non Mr. Jefferson’s estimate of genius, and concerning the rank and\r\nprivileges to which the distinguished writer conceives men of great\r\nphilosophical talents are entitled, the letter, just referred to, is now\r\npresented to him: it is as follows.\r\n\r\n                    “_Monticello in Albemarle, Virginia, July 19, 1778._\r\n\r\n  “Dear sir,\r\n\r\n      “I sincerely congratulate you on the recovery of Philadelphia, and\r\n  wish it may be found uninjured by the enemy. How far the interests of\r\n  literature may have suffered by the injury or removal of the Orrery\r\n  (as it is miscalled), the public libraries, and your papers and\r\n  implements, are doubts which still excite anxiety. We were much\r\n  disappointed in Virginia generally, on the day of the great\r\n  eclipse,[194] which proved to be cloudy in Williamsburg, where it was\r\n  total. I understand, only the beginning was seen at this place, which\r\n  is in Latitude 38° 8′ and Longitude West from Williamsburg, about 1°\r\n  45′ as is conjectured; eleven digits only were supposed to be covered.\r\n  It was not seen at all till the moon had advanced nearly one-third\r\n  over the sun’s disc. Afterwards, it was seen at intervals through the\r\n  whole. The egress particularly was visible. It proved, however, of\r\n  little use to me, for want of a time-piece that could be depended on;\r\n  which circumstance together with the subsequent restoration of\r\n  Philadelphia to you, has induced me to trouble you with this letter,\r\n  to remind you of your kind promise of making me an accurate clock,\r\n  which being intended for astronomical purposes only, I would have\r\n  divested of all apparatus for striking, or for any other purpose,\r\n  which by increasing its complication might disturb its accuracy. A\r\n  companion to it, for keeping seconds, and which might be moved easily,\r\n  would greatly add to its value. The theodolite, for which I spoke to\r\n  you also, I can now dispense with, having since purchased a most\r\n  excellent one.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n    This eclipse, which happened on the 24th day of June, 1778, was\r\n    observed in Philadelphia, by Dr. Rittenhouse, the Rev. Dr. W. Smith,\r\n    John Lukens, Esq. and Mr. Owen Biddle, at the College in that city.\r\n    The result of the joint observations made by those gentlemen on that\r\n    occasion, as drawn up by Dr. Smith, but never before published, will\r\n    be found in the Appendix. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  “Writing to a Philosopher, I may hope to be pardoned for intruding\r\n  some thoughts of my own, though they relate to him personally. Your\r\n  time for two years past has, I believe, been principally employed in\r\n  the civil government of your country. Though I have been aware of the\r\n  authority our cause would acquire with the world from its being known\r\n  that Yourself and Doctor Franklin were zealous friends to it, and am\r\n  myself duly impressed with a sense of the arduousness of government,\r\n  and the obligation those are under who are able to conduct it; yet I\r\n  am also satisfied there is an order of geniuses above that obligation,\r\n  and therefore exempted from it. Nobody can conceive that nature ever\r\n  intended to throw away a Newton upon the occupations of a crown. It\r\n  would have been a prodigality for which even the conduct of Providence\r\n  might have been arraigned, had he been by birth annexed to what was so\r\n  far below him. Co-operating with nature in her ordinary economy, we\r\n  should dispose of and employ the geniuses of men according to their\r\n  several orders and degrees. I doubt not there are in your country many\r\n  persons equal to the task of conducting government: but you should\r\n  consider that the world has but one Rittenhouse, and that it never had\r\n  one before. The amazing mechanical representation of the solar system\r\n  which you conceived and executed, has never been surpassed by any but\r\n  the work of which it is a copy. Are those powers then, which, being\r\n  intended for the erudition of the world, are, like air and light, the\r\n  world’s common property, to be taken from their proper pursuit to do\r\n  the common-place drudgery of governing a single state, a work which\r\n  may be executed by men of an ordinary stature, such as are always and\r\n  every where to be found? Without having ascended Mount Sinai for\r\n  inspiration, I can pronounce that the precept, in the decalogue of the\r\n  vulgar, that they shall not make to themselves the ‘likeness of any\r\n  thing that is in the heavens above,’ is reversed for you, and that you\r\n  will fulfil the highest purposes of your creation by employing\r\n  yourself in the perpetual breach of that inhibition. For my own\r\n  country in particular, you must remember something like a promise that\r\n  it should be adorned with one of them. The taking of your city by the\r\n  enemy has hitherto prevented the proposition from being made and\r\n  approved by our legislature. The zeal of a true whig in science must\r\n  excuse the hazarding these free thoughts, which flow from a desire of\r\n  promoting the diffusion of knowledge and of your fame, and of one who\r\n  can assure you truly that he is with much sincerity and esteem your\r\n  most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n                                                          TH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n  “P. S. If you can spare as much time as to give me notice of the\r\n  receipt of this, and what hope I may form of my Clock, it will oblige\r\n  me. If sent to Fredericksburg, it will come safe to hand.”\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of the year 1779, our benevolent Philosopher had an\r\nopportunity of testifying the friendly interest he took in the\r\nprosperity of his brother-in-law the Rev. Mr. Barton, and his family.\r\nThis gentleman was then, with Mrs. Barton,[195] in the city of New-York;\r\nto which they went towards the close of the year 1778, in pursuance of a\r\npermission granted for that purpose by the government of Pennsylvania,\r\nunder certain conditions. All Mr. Barton’s children excepting the\r\neldest, (the writer of these Memoirs), who was then abroad, remained in\r\nPennsylvania; those in their minority, being six of the seven so\r\nremaining, having been previously placed under the charge of suitable\r\npersons. After a long absence of the eldest son from his native country,\r\nhe returned to Pennsylvania the beginning of the year 1779. Immediately\r\nafter his arrival at Lancaster, he received a letter from Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, dated in Philadelphia, January 24th 1779, in which he\r\nsays—“I most sincerely congratulate you on your safe arrival, and\r\nimpatiently expect the pleasure of seeing you here. I received yours\r\nfrom Baltimore, ten days after the date, and immediately wrote to your\r\nfather,[196] supposing him to be still at New-York;[197] though we\r\ncannot be certain as to that matter.” The Rev. Mr. Barton, on the 15th\r\nof February, acknowledged the receipt of his brother-in-law’s letter to\r\nhim, which, although dated the 16th of January, did not reach him until\r\nthe 13th of the succeeding month. In this answer, Mr. Barton says;—“To\r\nsee, and to be united with my children, is my most earnest wish; but how\r\nthat happy event is to be obtained, I know not: If my son should choose\r\nto come to Elizabeth-Town, perhaps I might be indulged with a flag, to\r\nhave an interview with him there.”[198]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  To this lady, who is yet living, Mr. Barton was married in the year\r\n  1776. She remains his widow, and enjoys the very affectionate respect\r\n  of Mr. Barton’s descendants and relatives, to which her great worth\r\n  and many virtues justly entitle her.\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  Colonel Samuel J. Atlee, formerly a parishioner of the Rev. Mr.\r\n  Barton, had written two letters to him, to inform him of his son’s\r\n  arrival. The second of these only had got to hand, and was\r\n  acknowledged at the same time as Mr. Rittenhouse’s. Col. Atlee, who\r\n  was a steady friend of Mr. Barton’s family, was a valuable officer in\r\n  the American army, in the earlier period of the war; and afterwards\r\n  served as a delegate in congress, for the state of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  The difficulty of Mr. Barton’s returning to Pennsylvania, and which he\r\n  alludes to, in his letter to Mr. Rittenhouse, arose from the terms of\r\n  his passport to New-York, from the Supreme Executive Council of\r\n  Pennsylvania: it permits him to go to New-York, “not to return.” A\r\n  letter which Mr. Barton wrote to John De Hart, Esq. of Elizabeth-Town\r\n  in New-Jersey, on the 30th of January, 1779, will sufficiently explain\r\n  the conscientious scruples which actuated the writer’s conduct; and\r\n  they were such as, it is presumed, will have weight, when\r\n  dispassionately and liberally considered.\r\n\r\n  In addressing Mr. De Hart, Mr. Barton says:—“I received your favour of\r\n  the 22d instant, by Mr. Alexander. The papers with which you entrusted\r\n  me, gave me no trouble, except that of my not being able to serve you\r\n  in the manner which was first proposed. You may depend on their safety\r\n  in my hands; subject to such directions as you shall be pleased to\r\n  give me.” “I wish for an opportunity to oblige you, and if any should\r\n  offer, I beg you will employ me without any apology.\r\n\r\n  “I am just informed that my son has returned to his native country,\r\n  after an absence of between three and four years. How melancholy and\r\n  distressing is my situation! separated from eight children, and three\r\n  congregations, to whom I am bound by duty, gratitude, and every tie of\r\n  affection! ‘A parent only knows a parent’s woes;’ and such will feel\r\n  for me. You are kind enough to tell me, that my son requests me to\r\n  return to my parish. What he can mean by this request, I am totally at\r\n  a loss to understand: could the matter have been determined by my\r\n  option, I should never have left my parish, for any prospect of\r\n  preferment that could offer. But no choice was left me, but either to\r\n  take the oath, or to suffer a painful separation from my dearest\r\n  connexions; as well as from a country which always had, since I have\r\n  known it, my predilection and best wishes; a country to which, I can\r\n  declare (with an appeal to heaven for the truth of the declaration,) I\r\n  never did, or wished to do, ‘any act or thing prejudicial or\r\n  injurious:’ and though my heart assures me, that many conscientious\r\n  and good men have conformed to the test-act, yet my own conscience\r\n  always revolted at the abjuration part of it, and prevailed with me to\r\n  surrender every worldly consideration, that should come in\r\n  competition, or tempt me to a violation of it. This, sir, was the only\r\n  crime (if a crime it be) for which I now suffer banishment from all\r\n  that are most dear to me; with an interdict, “not to return again.” I\r\n  cannot therefore comprehend, how I can consistently return, before\r\n  this interdict is cancelled; or some assurance given me, that I may\r\n  again unite and live quietly with my family, without being subject to\r\n  an abjuration, which I cannot take. The proper duties and profession\r\n  of a minister of the gospel should, in my opinion, never lead him into\r\n  the field of politics. In conformity to this opinion, every man who\r\n  knows me can testify, that I never degraded my function by\r\n  intermeddling, directly or indirectly, in the present unhappy contest:\r\n  so that my own scruples would be a stricter tie upon me, than any that\r\n  could be made by oaths or tests. You will excuse my troubling you on\r\n  this subject, when I tell you, that the kind manner in which you\r\n  address me has drawn it upon you.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  It was Mr. Barton’s intention, when he left Pennsylvania, to embark at\r\n  New-York for England or Ireland: but his ill state of health, which\r\n  soon after ensued, prevented his leaving New-York.\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  This indulgence was obtained in April, 1780, from the Supreme\r\n  Executive Council of Pennsylvania, chiefly through the friendship of\r\n  the late general Joseph Reed, then president of that body; and, in\r\n  pursuance of this passport, sanctioned by general Washington, the\r\n  desired interview was had with Mr. and Mrs. Barton, at Elizabeth-Town,\r\n  a very short time before the death of Mr. Barton.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the same year, Mr. Rittenhouse again manifested his\r\nfriendly attachment to Mr. Barton’s family, on an occasion which\r\noffered, relating to the writer of these Memoirs personally. Soon after\r\nthe appointment of the late Henry Laurens, Esq. to be envoy to Holland,\r\nMr. Rittenhouse applied to that gentleman for the purpose of obtaining\r\nfor the writer, who was well known to him, the secretaryship to that\r\nmission: but Mr. Laurens had determined to appoint no secretary; at\r\nleast before he should arrive in Holland. In a letter to the writer of\r\nthis, communicating the result of his application, Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nsays—“I wish you could obtain some handsome thing of this kind; but\r\nthere are such numbers of humble suitors to, and dependants on, members\r\nof congress, that every thing is snapped up, before you or I know any\r\nthing of the matter.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a territorial dispute which had arisen between\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia, Mr. Rittenhouse was appointed by the\r\nlegislature of the former, in the year 1779, one of the commissioners\r\nfor settling that controversy: his colleagues, on that occasion, were\r\nGeorge Bryan, Esq. and the reverend Dr. Ewing.\r\n\r\nThese commissioners, thus nominated on behalf of their own state, were\r\nauthorised “to meet and agree with other commissioners, on the part of\r\nVirginia, upon the western boundary.” They accordingly met Dr. James\r\nMadison, president of the college of William and Mary, (late bishop of\r\nthe protestant episcopal church in Virginia), and Robert Andrews,\r\nprofessor of mathematics in that institution, the commissioners\r\nappointed by Virginia,—for the purposes of their respective\r\nappointments. This meeting was held on the 31st day of August, 1779. The\r\npropositions for an amicable adjustment of the boundary line in dispute,\r\nwere first made by Pennsylvania: and, at the meeting thus held, in\r\nconsequence of, Virginia having acceded to those propositions, the joint\r\ncommissioners of the two states entered into the following agreement:\r\n\r\n“We, George Bryan, John Ewing, and David Rittenhouse, commissioners from\r\nthe state of Pennsylvania, and we, James Madison and Robert Andrews,\r\ncommissioners for the state of Virginia, do hereby mutually, in behalf\r\nof our respective states, ratify and confirm the following agreement,\r\nviz. To extend Mason’s and Dixon’s line, due west, five degrees of\r\nlongitude, to be computed from the river Delaware, for the southern\r\nboundary of Pennsylvania, and that a meridian, drawn from the western\r\nextremity thereof to the northern limit of the said state, be the\r\nwestern boundary of Pennsylvania for ever.”\r\n\r\nThis agreement, signed by the respective commissioners of the contending\r\nstates, was, on the 19th of November ensuing, unanimously ratified and\r\nconfirmed by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, and its ratification\r\nduly transmitted to the government of Virginia.\r\n\r\nBut this agreement, thus solemnly concluded, did not quiet the\r\npre-existing disputes. Divers persons, deriving authority, or pretending\r\nso to do, under the government of Virginia, proceeded to Fort Byrd in\r\nthe county of Westmoreland, thirty miles at least within the line agreed\r\non by the commissioners,—and upon lands originally settled under\r\nPennsylvania, and long held as being within its unquestionable\r\njurisdiction; and these intruders there exercised a summary and\r\narbitrary authority, tending to the dispossession of the grantees under\r\nPennsylvania; vexing and disturbing them, greatly, in the peaceable\r\npossession of lands which they had honestly purchased, and cultivated\r\nfor a long course of years. Such injustice and outrages, on she part of\r\nthe Virginia intruders, induced congress to interpose the little\r\nauthority they possessed, for the purpose of tranquillizing the\r\ncontending parties, at a period when the harmony of the citizens of the\r\nseveral states was highly important to the safety of the whole\r\nconfederacy. Accordingly, in December, 1779, and nearly four months\r\nafter the adjustment of the before disputed boundary by the persons duly\r\nempowered to settle the same, congress passed a resolution, attested by\r\ntheir secretary, in these words:\r\n\r\n                                      “_In Congress, December 27, 1779._\r\n\r\n  “Whereas it appears to congress, from the representation of the\r\n  delegates of the state of Pennsylvania, that disputes have arisen\r\n  between the states of Pennsylvania and Virginia, relative to the\r\n  extent of their boundaries, which may probably be productive of\r\n  serious evils to both states, and tend to lessen their exertions in\r\n  the common defence: Therefore,\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That it be _recommended_ to the contending parties, not\r\n  to grant any part of the disputed land, or to disturb the possession\r\n  of any persons living thereon; and to avoid every appearance of force,\r\n  until the dispute can be amicably settled by both states, or brought\r\n  to a just decision by the intervention of congress; that possessions\r\n  forcibly taken be restored to the original possessors, and things be\r\n  placed in the situation in which they were at the commencement of the\r\n  present war, without prejudice to the claims of either party.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the face of this resolution, that congress were not\r\ndisposed to notice this controversy, otherwise, than with extreme\r\ndelicacy: and so cautious were they, under all existing circumstances,\r\nof interfering with the merits of this dispute between two great and\r\npowerful states, that they speak of the controversy as one then actually\r\nin existence, between those states; although, in regard to their\r\nrespective governments, it had been settled long before. However, the\r\nday after the date of the resolution of Congress, the president and the\r\nsupreme executive council of Pennsylvania issued a proclamation,\r\nrequiring all officers, civil and military, and others, subjects of the\r\nstate, to pay due obedience and respect to that resolution; and also\r\nencouraging the several grantees claiming under Pennsylvania to continue\r\nin the cultivation and improvement of their several estates and\r\npossessions, as well as in their allegiance and fidelity to the\r\nstate,—notwithstanding any claims or pretences set up by the state of\r\nVirginia, or any other foreign jurisdiction; and assuring them of the\r\nprotection and support of their own state, while so continuing in duty\r\nand obedience to its laws and government.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these proceedings, this extraordinary controversy\r\nwas not terminated until long afterwards. In consequence of a resolution\r\nof the general assembly of Pennsylvania, of the 28th of August, 1783,\r\nthe supreme executive council of that state passed, on the 11th day of\r\nthe succeeding month, a resolution on their part, stating,—that, as many\r\nof the objections which had hitherto prevented the determination of the\r\nboundary-line, in question, were then removed, it became necessary to\r\nclose that business with all possible accuracy and dispatch; and that,\r\nto this end, four commissioners should be immediately appointed, with\r\ndirections to provide the necessary astronomical apparatus, and to\r\ncorrespond with those appointed by the state of Virginia for the same\r\npurpose: they therefore appointed the Rev. John Ewing, D. D., David\r\nRittenhouse, Esq. treasurer of the state and Thomas Hutchins, Esq. to\r\nperform that duty.\r\n\r\nThe arduous service thus assigned to these gentlemen, all of them\r\npossessing great abilities, was accordingly executed; and a law was\r\nthereupon passed by the legislature of Pennsylvania, on the 1st of\r\nApril, 1784; which, after reciting that the boundary-line agreed on by\r\nthe former commissioners, on the 31st of August, 1779,—and which is\r\ntherein stated to have been unanimously confirmed by Pennsylvania on the\r\n23d of September, 1780, with the condition attached thereto by\r\nVirginia,[199]—was by this law finally confirmed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  The conditions proposed by the state of Virginia (and which\r\n  Pennsylvania considered as having a tendency to countenance\r\n  unwarrantable claims that might be made under the state of Virginia,\r\n  in consequence of pretended purchases or settlements, pending the\r\n  controversy,) were these; viz:—That the line, commonly called Mason\r\n  and Dixon’s line, be extended due west, 5° of long. to be computed\r\n  from the river Delaware, for the southern boundary of Pennsylvania,\r\n  and that a meridian, drawn from the western extremity thereof, to the\r\n  northern limits of the said states, respectively, be the western\r\n  boundary of Pennsylvania, for ever: on condition, that the private\r\n  property and rights of all persons, acquired under, founded on, or\r\n  recognized by the laws of either country, previous to the 31st of\r\n  August, 1779, should be saved and confirmed to them, although they\r\n  should be found to fall within the other; and that in the decision of\r\n  disputes thereon &c. (see act of 1st April, 1784.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse bore so conspicuous a part, in negociating and executing\r\nthis long-depending and important business, that the writer of his life\r\ncould not deem it improper to introduce into it, this historical detail\r\nof a transaction of so much moment, which originated in 1779 and was not\r\ncompleted until 1784; and, more particularly, as (to use the words of\r\nDr. Rush,) “to his talents, moderation and firmness, were ascribed, in a\r\ngreat degree, the satisfactory termination of that once alarming\r\ncontroversy.”\r\n\r\nThe death of the Rev. Mr. Barton, which occurred in the spring of\r\n1780,[200] put a period to the sincere and intimate friendship between\r\nthat gentleman and Mr. Rittenhouse, which had subsisted almost thirty\r\nyears. This friendship, which may be said to have commenced almost in\r\nthe youth of both parties, continued without interruption until the year\r\n1776; when the declaration of American independence produced, unhappily,\r\nsome abatement of it on each side; at least, so far as related to that\r\ngreat political measure, respecting which they entertained different\r\nopinions: For, although Mr. Barton was, in truth, warmly attached to the\r\nprinciples of the English whigs; and had, on various occasions,\r\nmanifested his zeal for the liberties of the American people and rights\r\nof the colonists;[201] his opinions were conscientiously opposed, and\r\nonly these, to the expediency of that measure. Yet it is believed, that\r\nthe personal friendship of these intimate relatives was far from having\r\never subsided: the ties that early united them, were of the strongest\r\nkind; that union was of long continuance; and they were mutually\r\nsensible of each other’s worth and talents.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  He died at New-York, the 25th of May, 1780, aged only fifty years; and\r\n  was interred in the chancel of St. George’s Chapel, in that city.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  As Mr. Barton’s deportment and services, very early in life, evinced\r\n  his devotion to the happiness of his adopted country, the writer hopes\r\n  he may be permitted, without being chargeable with great impropriety,\r\n  to adduce the following evidences, among many which might be\r\n  exhibited, of the usefulness and public spirit of a person, who was,\r\n  during a long course of years, intimately connected with, and a\r\n  confidential friend of David Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n  Annexed to a printed copy of “A letter, concerning the office and duty\r\n  of Protestant ministers, especially in times of public danger, written\r\n  to a clergyman on the frontiers of Pennsylvania, on general Braddock’s\r\n  defeat,”[201a] there is the following note:\r\n\r\n  “The gentleman to whom this was addressed,[201b] as well as some\r\n  ministers of other denominations, did, a few months after this, find\r\n  it necessary to appear at the head of their people, and were signally\r\n  instrumental in preventing some of the frontier counties from being\r\n  totally abandoned by their inhabitants.” See the Appendix to\r\n  “Discourses on public occasions in America: By William Smith, D. D.\r\n  Provost,” &c. who was the writer of the letter. It is dated,\r\n  “Philadelphia, August 21, 1755.”\r\n\r\n  Extract of a letter, dated London, January 10th, 1759, from the Hon.\r\n  Thomas Penn, Esq. to the Rev. Thomas Barton:—\r\n\r\n  “Since I received your last letter, I paid a visit to the present\r\n  Archbishop,[201c] and mentioned to him what you wished me to do. I\r\n  found he did not approve of your contemplated removal; but he\r\n  proposed, that twenty pounds sterling per annum should be added to\r\n  your salary: for, his grace observed, that a person so capable as you\r\n  are, to advise and assist the people in your neighbourhood,[201d]\r\n  could not be spared for any other mission: And, on that consideration,\r\n  the society[201e] had agreed to this augmentation of your salary.”\r\n\r\n  On the 17th of June, 1767, Mr. Penn again wrote to Mr. Barton, from\r\n  London; as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I am much concerned to find, that the missionaries have suffered so\r\n  much, and that you are so uneasy in your situation as to have asked\r\n  leave to move into Maryland. The society has offered, or intend to\r\n  offer, an addition to your salary, or some other encouragement, if you\r\n  stay in Pennsylvania: and I have desired Mr. Hamilton,[201f] who is\r\n  upon his return, to talk to you on this affair, before you take your\r\n  resolution; as I hope and intend to make you a present from me,[201g]\r\n  if you do not put that design into execution.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 201a:\r\n\r\n  This letter is contained in a volume of Dr. Smith’s Sermons, &c.\r\n  published in England in two editions, in the years 1759 and 1762; and\r\n  is also comprehended in an elegant edition of the Doctor’s works,\r\n  republished in Philadelphia a few years since.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201b:\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Mr. Barton.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201c:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Thomas Secker, then lately translated from the diocese of Oxford\r\n  to the archi-episcopal see of Canterbury: “a name,” as the author of\r\n  the _Pursuits of Literature_ has justly observed, “never to be uttered\r\n  but with reverence, as the great exemplar of metropolitan strictness,\r\n  erudition, and dignity.” This excellent prelate, after most worthily\r\n  sustaining the highest station in the English church more than ten\r\n  years, died in the year 1768.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201d:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Barton’s residence was, at that time, in Redding township, York\r\n  county, then a frontier settlement of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201e:\r\n\r\n  The Society for the propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201f:\r\n\r\n  James Hamilton, Esquire.—This gentleman was lieutenant-governor of\r\n  Pennsylvania from the year 1748 to 1754—again, from 1759 to 1763—and\r\n  president of the proprietary and governor’s council, from the 6th of\r\n  May, 1771, to the 16th of October in the same year. He was a liberal\r\n  patron of learning and science.\r\n\r\n                “Est et Hamiltonus nomen venerabile, cujus\r\n                Intemerata fides.”——J.

This farm, which was part of one of the\r\n  proprietary-manors, Mr. Barton held during his life.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe name of the Rev. Mr. Barton, which has hitherto been so often\r\nintroduced in the course of these Memoirs, is closely connected with\r\nthat of Mr. Rittenhouse, in many of the more striking traits of his\r\nLife: the writer cannot, therefore, restrain himself from acknowledging,\r\nthat he is happy in having this fair opportunity of rendering some small\r\ntribute of respect—and, for himself, of filial veneration—to the memory\r\nof a man distinguished by his virtue, his talents, and his learning;\r\none, who, independently of those considerations, alone, which arose out\r\nof the American revolution, long enjoyed the friendship and esteem of\r\nmany of the most prominent characters in America, by reason of his\r\nabilities and usefulness, as well as the urbanity of his manners. To\r\nhave said _less_ of this person, would be doing injustice to the life\r\nand character of Mr. Rittenhouse: to say _more_, would perhaps be deemed\r\nirrelevant to the subject; if not indecorous, as it regards the writer.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, more particularly to Mr. Rittenhouse. On the 10th\r\nday of March, 1780, he was elected, by the general assembly of\r\nPennsylvania, a trustee of the loan-office of the state.\r\n\r\nThe institution here mentioned was a measure of financial policy, which\r\nhad its origin in Pennsylvania, at an early period of the provincial\r\ngovernment: and, from an experience of its beneficial effects, it was\r\nnot only continued, at various intervals of time, from the year 1723, to\r\nthe termination of that government; but was resorted to, and for some\r\ntime continued, by the state legislatures after the revolution. The\r\nscarcity of gold and silver, among the earlier settlers of the province,\r\nsubjected them to many and great inconveniences, and suggested to the\r\nlegislature the necessity of adopting some rational and efficient means\r\nof remedying the evil. The expedient was, the emiting, and making\r\ncurrent, bills of credit; which were loaned to cultivators of the soil\r\non the security of their lands, and repayable with interest, in annual\r\npayments, within an assigned term of years. The first act of assembly\r\nfor this purpose was passed the 11th of May, 1723; and the preamble to\r\nthat law is expressive of its object: it states, that, “Forasmuch as\r\nthrough the scarcity of money, the trade of this province is greatly\r\nlessened and obstructed, and the payment of the public debts of this\r\ngovernment rendered exceeding difficult, and likely so to continue,\r\nunless some medium in commerce be by law made current, instead of money:\r\nfor remedy whereof, may it please the governor that it be enacted, and\r\nbe it enacted by Sir William Keith, baronet, Governor, &c.” This act\r\nthen goes on to direct the emission of “fifteen thousand pounds, current\r\nmoney of America, according to an act of Parliament made in the sixth\r\nyear of Queen Anne, for ascertaining the rates of foreign coins in the\r\nPlantations;” and provides for the loaning of these bills, by persons\r\nthereby appointed “trustees of the general loan-office;” to be loaned\r\nout, upon the security of mortgages of real estates, within the\r\nprovince, of at least three times the value of the sums lent: which sums\r\nso loaned were made repayable in those bills, in eight years, in annual\r\npayments of one-eighth part of the amount of the principal with the\r\naddition of an interest of five per cent. per annum. The act also\r\ncontains a provision (but one which was omitted in the subsequent\r\nloan-office laws,) for lending these bills upon the security of plate\r\nalso, for the term of one year. This paper-money, thus established upon\r\nindubitable funds,[202] was made a legal tender in the payment of\r\ndebts;—and it never suffered any depreciation of its nominal value.[203]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  While the credit of the loan-office bills of credit, emitted in\r\n  moderate sums by the assembly of Pennsylvania, was fully supported,\r\n  during the course of seventy years, the quantities of paper-money\r\n  issued at different times, by the legislative body of Massachusetts,\r\n  down to the year 1748, had then depreciated that currency, for want of\r\n  it being bottomed on sufficient funds, to one-eleventh part of its\r\n  nominal value. Fortunately, about that period, a large sum in specie\r\n  arrived from England, having been granted by the British parliament to\r\n  reimburse the monies expended by the colonists in the expeditions\r\n  against Louisburg and Canada. In Massachusetts, this money was wisely\r\n  applied by its legislature to the redemption of the bills of credit of\r\n  that colony, then in circulation; which were sunk, in the succeeding\r\n  year, at the rate of fifty shillings, in those bills, for one ounce of\r\n  silver. Thus, the mint-price of an ounce of sterling silver being five\r\n  shillings and two pence, the bills were redeemed at the rate of nearly\r\n  nine shillings and eight pence, of their nominal value, for one\r\n  shilling in English coin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  How different, in this respect, from that species of paper-credit,\r\n  which, during the American war, succeeded it, under the denomination\r\n  of _continental money_! But this had nothing but the faith of\r\n  government pledged for its redemption; while the loan-office bills of\r\n  credit were bottomed (as all government-paper ought ever to be) on an\r\n  appropriated, sufficient, and substantial fund. For want of such a\r\n  foundation, Dr. Morse remarks, that “The whole history of the\r\n  continental paper is a history of public and private frauds. Old\r\n  specie debts,” says he, “were often paid in a depreciated currency;\r\n  and even new contracts, for a few weeks or days, were often discharged\r\n  with a small part of their value. From this plenty, and the\r\n  fluctuating state of the medium, sprung hosts of speculators and\r\n  itinerant traders, who left their honest occupations for the purpose\r\n  of immense gains in a fraudulent business, that depended on no fixed\r\n  principles, and the profits of which could be reduced to no certain\r\n  calculations.” See his Geographical work.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHence, an interesting fact is presented to the view of the reader; that,\r\nninety years ago, so small was the population, and so slender were the\r\nagricultural and commercial resources of Pennsylvania, that the scanty\r\namount of a sum equivalent to forty thousand dollars, was deemed\r\nadequate to the relief of the public and private difficulties in the\r\nprovince, arising from the want of a sufficient circulating medium at\r\nthat time. Yet such was the increase of population and trade, and such\r\nwere the improvements in agriculture, in Pennsylvania, in half a century\r\nafterwards, that the last loan-office law, under the provincial\r\ngovernment,[204] directed the emission of ten times the original sum; to\r\nbe applied, in aid of land-improvements, in loans for the term of\r\nsixteen years; and repayable in like manner, with an annual interest of\r\nsix per centum.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  Passed 26th February, 1773.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe same policy was pursued by the independent government of\r\nPennsylvania. Under the first loan-office law of that state,[205] the\r\nsum of fifty thousand pounds was issued in bills of credit; and eight\r\nyears afterwards, a further sum of half a million of dollars (or\r\n187,500_l._) was appropriated for the purposes of a loan-office on\r\nsimilar principles, in pursuance of a law of the state.[206] But, as the\r\nindividual state-governments were prohibited by the constitution of the\r\nUnited States, then recently established, from emitting bills of credit,\r\nor making any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of\r\ndebts,—the money to be employed in loans, on mortgages of real estates,\r\nwas to be borrowed, according to the provisions of the law last\r\nmentioned, from the bank of Pennsylvania; a power which the state had\r\nreserved, for that express purpose, in the act to incorporate the\r\nsubscribers to that bank.[207]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  Passed 4th April, 1785.\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  Passed 11th April, 1793.\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\n  Passed 30th March, 1793.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis loan-office law was, however, the last in Pennsylvania.[208] The\r\nestablishment of banks, for facilitating the purposes of trade, together\r\nwith the great improvements and wealth to which the landed interest of\r\nthe state had attained, by means of a widely extended foreign commerce,\r\ncoming in aid of the benefits which the cultivators had previously\r\nderived from the loan-office system, superseded, in a great degree, the\r\nutility of this institution. In one year after the last loan-office was\r\nerected, the law for that purpose was repealed; the repealing act\r\ndeclaring—that it had been found inexpedient, and not to answer the\r\npurposes intended by the legislature. In fact, the establishment of\r\nbanks in the interior of the country, not only supplies the place of a\r\nloan-office, in relation to the farmer, but greatly facilitates the\r\nextensive inland trade of the state. Experience has demonstrated, that,\r\noperating in this way, they are productive of all the important\r\nadvantages of the loan-office system: and of this institution, the late\r\ngovernor Pownall speaks in these remarkable words—“I will venture to\r\nsay, that there never was a wiser or a better measure; never one better\r\ncalculated to serve the uses of an increasing country; that there never\r\nwas a measure more steadily pursued, or more faithfully executed, for\r\nforty years together,[209] than the loan-office in Pennsylvania, formed\r\nand administered by the assembly of that province.”[210]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse continued to hold the place of a trustee of the\r\n  loan-office more than ten years; but on the 1st of April, 1790, a law\r\n  was passed, by which all the powers and duties of the trustees of that\r\n  institution were transferred to, and vested in, the treasurer of the\r\n  state.\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  The loan-office system was kept up, in Pennsylvania, thirty years\r\n  after governor Pownall wrote.\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  Paper-money was not so well managed in some of the other colonies,\r\n  where it was issued in too large quantities, and its credit not\r\n  established on funds sufficiently stable and secure;[210a] a\r\n  circumstance which induced the parliament of Great-Britain to\r\n  interdict, for a time, further emissions of that sort of money, called\r\n  bills of credit, by the provincial legislatures.\r\n\r\n  Although the last emission of loan-office bills of credit, under the\r\n  colonial government of Pennsylvania, was made in the beginning of the\r\n  year 1773, the want of this succedaneum for gold and silver, as a\r\n  circulating medium of commerce commensurate to the encreased\r\n  population and trade of the country, was experienced some considerable\r\n  time before. In a letter written by the Hon. Mr. T. Penn to the Rev.\r\n  Mr. Barton, dated, London, June 17, 1767, the writer says:\r\n\r\n  “Your account of the increase of the growth of hemp, gives me great\r\n  pleasure; and I think the demand there has been for wheat, since the\r\n  date of your letter, must have made the country people rich, even\r\n  those who were poor before: it will prevent people being under the\r\n  necessity of parting with their lands, and going to Carolina. Their\r\n  produce will always bring them money at Philadelphia, notwithstanding\r\n  there may be some more need for paper-money; yet, when trade is brisk,\r\n  it circulates faster, and a less quantity will carry on a greater\r\n  trade: however, I hope, in the next session of parliament, we may get\r\n  the law which prohibits our making any more, repealed.”\r\n\r\n  The parliamentary restriction was, in fact, afterwards taken off; and\r\n  an effort was made, in the beginning of the year 1770, by the\r\n  legislature of Pennsylvania, to enact a loan-office law, for the\r\n  purpose of putting in circulation a further emission of paper-money:\r\n  but the measure then miscarried, in consequence of some disagreement\r\n  between the governor and the general assembly respecting the right\r\n  they severally claimed, of appointing the trustees of the proposed\r\n  loan-office.\r\n\r\nFootnote 210a:\r\n\r\n  See Note 202.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the year 1782, Mr. Rittenhouse was elected a Fellow of the Academy of\r\nArts and Sciences, of Boston: his certificate bears date the 30th of\r\nJanuary, in that year. This academy, which Dr. Morse ranks among the\r\nfirst literary institutions in the state of Massachusetts, holds a very\r\nrespectable station in relation to science: yet it was not established\r\ntill so lately as May 4, 1780. The end and design of the institution are\r\nstated to be—“to promote and encourage the knowledge of the antiquities\r\nof America, and of the natural history of the country, and to determine\r\nthe uses to which its various natural productions may be applied: also,\r\nto promote and encourage medical discoveries, mathematical\r\ndisquisitions, philosophical enquiries and experiments; astronomical,\r\nmeteorological and geographical observations, improvements in\r\nagriculture, arts, manufactures, commerce, and the cultivation of every\r\nscience that may tend to advance a free, independent and virtuous\r\npeople.”[211]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  The number of members in the Boston Academy is never to exceed two\r\n  hundred, nor to be less than forty. By being limited to so moderate a\r\n  number as the former, for the greater extreme, this academy will be\r\n  likely to select suitable persons for the honour of fellowship, with\r\n  the more discriminating circumspection.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is supposed to have been somewhat about this time, that Mr.\r\nRittenhouse exercised his ingenuity upon an object, which, though not of\r\ngreat importance, is nevertheless a matter of considerable utility and\r\nsome curiosity; the invention of an Hygrometer, made wholly of wood. The\r\nsimplicity of the construction of this instrument, renders it easily\r\nattainable by almost every one; and as it is found to answer, very well,\r\nthe end for which more expensive instruments are often employed, it may\r\nbe considered as being more generally useful. Descriptions of the\r\nconstruction, and principle of operation, of this Hygrometer, having\r\nbeen furnished to the writer through the obligingness of two of his\r\nfriends,[212] a very concise account of it, drawn up from those\r\ndescriptions, is given in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  Robert Patterson, Esq. Director of the Mint, and David Rittenhouse\r\n  Waters, Esq. a gentleman bred to the law, and a grandson of the late\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n  The decease of Mr. Waters happened soon after: he died on the 4th of\r\n  September, 1813, at the premature age of twenty-two years. Although he\r\n  had just entered on the threshold of the world, this excellent young\r\n  man exhibited many proofs of extraordinary attainments in literature\r\n  and science, as well as of a superior genius. He appeared to have\r\n  inherited from his maternal grandfather, congenial talents. In his\r\n  life, his amiable disposition endeared him to all who had an\r\n  opportunity of knowing his virtues: in his death, not only have his\r\n  relatives and friends experienced an afflicting bereavement, but his\r\n  country has sustained the loss of a citizen of great promise.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA circumstance shall be noticed in this place, which, although trivial\r\nin itself, will serve to shew the grateful sense entertained by our\r\nPhilosopher of the merits of General Washington. It appears, that just\r\nabout the time when the provisional articles of peace, concluded on\r\nbetween the United States and Great-Britain, were made known in America,\r\nMr. Rittenhouse had forwarded to the General, at the head-quarters of\r\nthe army, a pair of spectacles, and reading glasses,—as a small\r\ntestimonial of his respect for the character and services of that great\r\nman. The terms of the letter that accompanied this little present, are\r\nnot known to the writer of these memoirs; but, of what complexion they\r\nwere, may be inferred from the General’s answer, which is in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n                                            “_Newburgh, 16th Feb. 1783._\r\n\r\n  “Sir,\r\n\r\n      “I have been honoured with your letter of the 7th, and beg you to\r\n  accept my sincere thanks, for the favor conferred on me, in the\r\n  Glasses—which are very fine; but more particularly, for the flattering\r\n  expressions which accompanied the present.\r\n\r\n  “The Spectacles suit my eyes extremely well—as I am persuaded the\r\n  Reading-Glasses also will, when I get more accustomed to the use of\r\n  them. At present, I find some difficulty in coming at the proper\r\n  focus; but when I do obtain it, they magnify perfectly, and shew those\r\n  letters very distinctly, which at first appear like a mist—blended\r\n  together and confused. With great esteem and respect, I am, Sir, your\r\n  most obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                        “GO. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n  “DAVID RITTENHOUSE, Esq.”\r\n\r\nThe grinding and polishing of the glasses were of Mr. Rittenhouse’s own\r\nworkmanship; and they were made for the purpose. This circumstance,\r\nadded to the manner and occasion of their being presented, could not\r\nfail of being highly acceptable to the General.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1784, Mr. Rittenhouse was employed on the part of\r\nPennsylvania, for the purpose of determining the western extension of\r\nthat state; and was associated in that business with Mr. Lukens, Dr.\r\nEwing, and Capt. Hutchins: the commissioners in behalf of Virginia were\r\nDr. (afterwards bishop) Madison, Mr. Ellicott,[213] Mr. J. Page, and the\r\nRev. Mr. R. Andrews. A record of the astronomical observations which\r\nwere made on this occasion, and on similar ones of an important nature,\r\nwill be found detailed in a letter, under the date of April 2, 1795,\r\naddressed by Mr. Ellicott to Mr. Patterson, in the fourth volume of the\r\nAm. Philos. Society’s Transactions. Among the observations contained in\r\nthe first part of that letter, are those of the immersions of the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, taken at Wilmington on the Delaware, by Messrs.\r\nRittenhouse, Lukens, Page and Andrews, at divers days from the 1st to\r\nthe 23d of August, in the year 1784; together with those taken at the\r\nwestern observatory by Messrs. Ellicott, Ewing, Madison and Hutchins, at\r\ndivers days from the 17th of July to the 19th of August; also, the\r\nemersions of those satellites by the same eastern observers, from the\r\n29th of August to the 19th of September; and by the same western\r\nobservers, from the 27th of August to the 19th of September; all in the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\n  Although Mr. Ellicott is a native of Pennsylvania, and was a citizen\r\n  of that state until the British army took possession of Philadelphia,\r\n  in 1777, he resided in Baltimore county about eight years after that\r\n  event.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“After the determination,” says Mr. Ellicott, “we completed the southern\r\nboundary of Pennsylvania; it being likewise the north boundary of\r\nMaryland, and a part of Virginia; and which had been carried on some\r\nyears before,[214] by Messrs. Mason and Dixon, the distance of 242\r\nmiles.” This line is in the parallel of 39° 43′ 18″ North latitude.[215]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  In the years 1767 and 1768.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  The difference of 16′ 42″, between the latitude above mentioned and\r\n  the beginning of the 40th degree of north latitude, (which was the\r\n  southern limit assigned to Pennsylvania, by her charter,) was gained\r\n  by Mr. Penn, as far as the northern boundary of Maryland extended\r\n  westward, in consequence of a compromise entered into by him and Lord\r\n  Baltimore; whereby the latter obtained some advantage on his part in\r\n  return. From the western extremity of this northern boundary of\r\n  Maryland, the line between Pennsylvania and Virginia was continued,\r\n  westward, in the same parallel of latitude, (instead of these coming\r\n  back to the 40th deg. of N. lat.) by virtue of an agreement between\r\n  these two states; the former, in consideration of that privilege,\r\n  relinquishing her right to run her western boundary line parallel to\r\n  the meandrings of the river Delaware.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt was at the close of this year, that the college of William and Mary,\r\nin Virginia, complimented Mr. Rittenhouse with an honorary degree of\r\nMaster of Arts, by an unanimous vote of the rectors and faculty of that\r\ninstitution. His diploma, which is a special one, and wherein he is\r\nstyled the Chief of Philosophers,[216] has a place in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  “Principem Philosophorum,” in the original:—Such was the appellation\r\n  (Principes Philosophorum) by which Cicero honours Pythagoras,\r\n  Democritus, Plato, Xenocrates, Zeno, Cleanthes, Diogenes the Stoic;\r\n  men, among others, whose usefulness (he observes) old age might\r\n  diminish, but not destroy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe college of William and Mary was founded in the joint reign of the\r\nking and queen of those names, who endowed it with twenty thousand acres\r\nof land, besides a small duty on certain exported tobaccoes, granted by\r\nstat. 25 Ch. II: in addition to which, the assembly of Virginia also\r\ngave to it, by temporary laws, a duty on liquors imported, and on skins\r\nand furs exported. And from these resources, its funds amounted, on a\r\nmedium, to more than 3,000_l._ Virginia currency, (or $10,000,) per\r\nannum. The Hon. Robert Boyle,[217] of England, had also made a liberal\r\ndonation to this college, for the purpose of instituting a\r\nprofessorship, called the Brafferton, (the name of the English estate,\r\npurchased with the money granted by him to the college,) for the purpose\r\nof compensating missionaries, to instruct the Indian natives and to\r\nconvert them to Christianity. After the revolution, the constitution of\r\nthe college of William and Mary underwent a considerable change: three\r\nof the six original professorships, that is to say, two of Divinity, and\r\none of the Greek and Latin languages, were abolished; and three others,\r\nnamely, one for Law and Police—one for Anatomy and Medicine—and a third\r\nfor Modern Languages, were substituted in their stead; the Brafferton,\r\nit is presumed, has been diverted into other channels, if not wholly\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Boyle was the seventh son of Richard, the first earl of Cork, in\r\n  Ireland, and first earl of Burlington, in England; and was born at\r\n  Lismore in Ireland, the 26th of January, 1627. This eminent\r\n  philosopher and sincere Christian established, by his will, in the\r\n  year 1691, a perpetual fund, equivalent to about two hundred and\r\n  twenty-two dollars per annum, for instituting a course of eight\r\n  sermons or lectures, to be delivered annually; designed to prove the\r\n  truth of Christianity, generally, without engaging in any of the\r\n  controversies subsisting among its professors: And to this\r\n  establishment, denominated _Boyle’s Lectures_, the world are indebted\r\n  for many able and elaborate defences both of natural and revealed\r\n  religion. In addition to several extensive benefactions, for\r\n  charitable and religious purposes, of this great and excellent man,\r\n  besides his donation to the College of William-and-Mary (which,\r\n  according to Mr. Jefferson, was “considerable” in its amount,) he\r\n  gave, in his lifetime, a sum equivalent to thirteen hundred and\r\n  thirty-three dollars, towards propagating the Christian Religion in\r\n  America. So great was his veneration for the name of God, that he\r\n  never pronounced it without a discernible pause: he was steady in his\r\n  secret addresses to the throne of heaven: and, amidst all his\r\n  enquiries into nature, his chief design seemed to be that of\r\n  continually elevating his own mind, and the minds of others, by\r\n  contemplating the Glory, the Wisdom, and the Goodness of God. Were\r\n  this illustrious man to be considered in no other point of view, than\r\n  that of a benefactor to America, his memory would be entitled to\r\n  respect in this country: but his virtues, his talents, and the\r\n  services he has rendered to mankind in general, will for ever endear\r\n  his name to the good and wise of all nations. He died the 30th of\r\n  December, in the year 1691.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis once respectable college, or university, is at present in an\r\nunprosperous condition; and will not probably soon, if ever, regain its\r\nformer reputation. A country of which a large portion of the population\r\nconsists of slaves, is ill suited for the site of an extensive seminary\r\nof learning, and for the education of youth: nor can it be expected,\r\nthat where an almost despotic sway of masters over their slaves[218] is\r\ndaily exhibited to the view of both young and old, the children of those\r\nmasters will submit to that degree of subordination, and to that\r\nexercise of authority by their literary preceptors, which the discipline\r\nof an academic education renders indispensable. The late Bishop Madison\r\ncontributed much by his abilities, his suavity of manners and his\r\nprudence, to maintain a due degree of order in this institution, over\r\nwhich he long presided with distinguished reputation; but the death of\r\nthat respectable man, it is feared, augurs ill for the future prosperity\r\nof the seminary.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  The author of a poem, entitled, ‘The Dying Negro,’ has introduced\r\n  these lines into that poem:[218a]\r\n\r\n           “Oft have I seen them, at the break of day,\r\n           “Rous’d by the lash, go forth their cheerless way.”\r\n\r\n  No man ever held the slave-trade, and the condition of the hapless\r\n  people who are the objects of that nefarious traffic, in greater\r\n  abhorrence, than the benevolent Rittenhouse: a passage in his Oration,\r\n  fully evinces his sentiments on this subject.\r\n\r\n  In addition to this highly respectable testimony against Negro\r\n  Slavery, let it be remembered, that one of the last acts, of a public\r\n  nature, in which our philosopher’s predecessor[218b] was concerned,\r\n  was to sanction with his name the Memorial presented to the government\r\n  of the United States, on the subject of the Slave-Trade, by “The\r\n  Pennsylvania Society for promoting the Abolition of Slavery, and the\r\n  relief of free Negroes, unlawfully held in Bondage;” of which Society,\r\n  that distinguished man was the President.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218a:\r\n\r\n  It was written by Mr. Day, the friend of Mr. Darwin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218b:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Franklin.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the year following, the tracing of a meridian, northward, for the\r\nwestern boundary of Pennsylvania,—and, consequently, the eastern\r\nboundary of part of Virginia,—was commenced, from the western end of the\r\nsouthern line of Pennsylvania before mentioned. On this occasion, Mr.\r\nRittenhouse addressed the following letter to Mr. Ellicott.\r\n\r\n                                      “_Philadelphia, April 28th, 1785._\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  “For some months past I had not the least apprehension of being\r\n  obliged to visit the Ohio, this spring; but our affairs have taken\r\n  such a turn, that at present it is probable I shall meet you, at the\r\n  time and place appointed. Capt. Hutchins has been sent for to New\r\n  York, by Congress, as the trustees of the university will not consent\r\n  to Dr. Ewing’s absence. One or other of us will certainly set off in a\r\n  few days, to meet you: our waggons are already gone.\r\n\r\n  “I have earnestly recommended to council to commission you to act in\r\n  behalf of Pennsylvania,[219] after we pass the Ohio; and the president\r\n  directs me to inform you, that they mean to send you a commission for\r\n  the purpose: I hope it will suit your convenience.\r\n\r\n  “I ought long since to have informed you, that you were elected a\r\n  member of our Philosophical Society—I wish you would favour us with a\r\n  communication, on any subject you please. Pray let me hear from you,\r\n  before you leave Baltimore. Have you any account from Virginia? I am,\r\n  dear sir, yours with respect and sincerity.\r\n\r\n                                                     “DAVID RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n  “ANDREW ELLICOTT, Esq. Baltimore.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Ellicott being a commissioner for Virginia, his powers would have\r\n  ceased, as soon as the boundary-line between that state and\r\n  Pennsylvania had reached the river Ohio. The object, therefore, was to\r\n  enable him to complete it, to its western extremity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis boundary-line was begun in May, 1785, by Messrs. Rittenhouse,\r\nEllicott, Porter, and Nevill; assisted by the present Dr. Benjamin Smith\r\nBarton, then a youth about nineteen years of age, whose medical and\r\nother scientific acquirements rendered him, even at that early period of\r\nlife, an useful associate of the commissioners. Mr. Nevill (who was\r\nemployed on the part of Virginia) left the other commissioners late in\r\nAugust; and Mr. Rittenhouse, about the middle of September.[220] Dr.\r\nBarton remained until some time in October, when these operations ceased\r\nfor that season. The line then wanted about 55⅓ miles of being\r\ncompleted: and this part of it, to its intersection of the margin of\r\nLake Erie, was finished in the following year, by Col. Porter and\r\nAlexander Maclain, Esq.[221]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  The following report of the progress of their work was made by the\r\n  commissioners, to the government of Pennsylvania, between three and\r\n  four weeks before Mr. Rittenhouse set out on his return to\r\n  Philadelphia: it is entered on the journal of the general assembly of\r\n  that state, under the date of Nov. 2, 1785.\r\n\r\n  “We the subscribers, commissioners, appointed by the states of\r\n  Pennsylvania and Virginia, to ascertain the boundary between the said\r\n  states, do certify, that we have carried on a meridian line from the\r\n  south-west corner of Pennsylvania, northward, to the river Ohio; and\r\n  marked it, by cutting a wide vista over all the principal hills\r\n  intersected by the said line, and by falling or deadening a line of\r\n  trees, generally, through all the lower grounds. And we have likewise\r\n  placed stones, marked on the east side, P. and on the west side, V. on\r\n  most of the principal hills, and where the line strikes the Ohio;\r\n  which stones are accurately placed in the true meridian, bounding the\r\n  states as aforesaid.”\r\n\r\n  “Witness our hands and seals, this 23d day of August, 1785. (Signed,)\r\n  DAVID RITTENHOUSE, ANDREW PORTER, Pennsylvania; ANDREW ELLICOTT,\r\n  JOSEPH NEVILL; Virginia.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse had probably a reference to the expected completion of\r\n  this line, perhaps to the whole business, generally, when, in a letter\r\n  to Mr. Ellicott, of the 31st of Jan. 1786, he says; “I shall be able,\r\n  some time hence, to write to you more fully about the boundary lines.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt will be readily conceived, that a person of Mr. Rittenhouse’s\r\ndelicate constitution, and regularity in his mode of living when at\r\nhome, must have experienced much inconvenience and felt many privations\r\nof comfort, while climbing rugged mountains, traversing vast\r\nuncultivated forests, and sleeping in a tent, for successive months, as\r\nhe was necessarily obliged to do, when employed on occasions of this\r\nkind. For, although the government afforded to the gentlemen engaged in\r\nthese arduous services, very liberal accommodations, there were,\r\nnevertheless, numerous conveniencies which the nature of the duty to be\r\nperformed rendered unattainable. Yet it is a fact, that Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nalways returned from these excursions with a better stock of health,\r\nthan he sat out with; notwithstanding the hardships he sometimes\r\nendured, and the many unpleasant circumstances in regard to weather,\r\ndiet, bedding, &c. which he was compelled to encounter. The two\r\nfollowing letters, written by him to his wife, while he was engaged in\r\nthe service of establishing the boundary-line last mentioned, will\r\nenable the reader to form a pretty good judgment of the kind of life he\r\nthen passed. They will at the same time serve to shew, in some degree,\r\nthe bent of his mind and the disposition of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe first of those letters, dated at “Wheeling Creek,” June 30th 1785,\r\nis in these words.\r\n\r\n  “My dearest H,\r\n\r\n  “I have not heard one word from Philadelphia, since I left you. About\r\n  a month ago I wrote to you from Union Town, and I promise myself a\r\n  letter from you by the first messenger from that place, who is now\r\n  daily expected. To-morrow Mr. Armstrong sets off for Hanna’s Town,\r\n  where he expects to meet brother Isaac Jacobs, so that I write in\r\n  confidence of my letter reaching you.\r\n\r\n  “If I were to view only the dark side of my situation, I should\r\n  complain that I am here secluded from the society of those I love,\r\n  deprived of books and every other of my most favourite amusements;\r\n  confined to homely fare by day, and a hard bed at night; and obliged,\r\n  by our business, to take rather too much exercise. But these\r\n  inconveniences are in some measure counterbalanced by several\r\n  advantages: I am not condemned to hear that eternal din for money,\r\n  which it pains me to think you are every day perplexed with;[222]\r\n  politics have no existence here; constant and regular exercise causes\r\n  me to sleep much better at nights, than I did at home;—we have a woman\r\n  to cook for us, so that our bread is good, and every thing else\r\n  tolerable. Colonel Porter is attentive, and cousin Benjamin[223] has\r\n  recommended himself as an agreeable companion, to all of us; and I\r\n  could almost call Mr. Ellicott a congenial soul.\r\n\r\n  “I ever delighted in a wild uncultivated country; this is truly\r\n  romantic, and, at this season of the year, beautiful and luxuriant in\r\n  the highest degree. A few days ago, I walked up a little rivulet, in\r\n  company with Mr. Ellicott, for a considerable distance, in order to\r\n  enjoy the romantic scene. It was bounded on each side by steep hills\r\n  of an immense height: its bottom was finely paved with large\r\n  flag-stones, rising in steps, with, every now and then, a beautiful\r\n  cascade. The further we went, the more gloomy and cool we found it. At\r\n  last, I advised Mr. Ellicott that we should proceed no further; for,\r\n  if we did, we should in all probability find some of the\r\n  water-goddesses,—perhaps stark naked and fast asleep. Mr. A—— went\r\n  with us, for company-sake; but neither the nymphs nor their shady\r\n  bowers have any charms for _him_.[224]—Nothing but your company was\r\n  wanting to me, to heighten the enchanting scene.\r\n\r\n  “Deer are incredibly plenty here—I was the first that caught a young\r\n  fawn, and hoped to have sent the beautiful little animal a present to\r\n  H****. We kept it about a week, and it became quite tame; but our cows\r\n  ran away, and it was starved for want of milk. Col. P. called it F——\r\n  B——, and says H**** shall at least have the skin. We have all been\r\n  very healthy; my cough diminishes slowly, my old complaint is less\r\n  troublesome, and I have no other.\r\n\r\n  “I am not yet determined, as to the time of my return. Later than\r\n  September, I have no thoughts of staying; perhaps the fear of riding\r\n  in hot weather may induce me to stay till then.\r\n\r\n  “We have, hitherto, made so slow a progress, that I am much\r\n  dissatisfied with it; but do not know how to help it. Our greatest\r\n  difficulty arises from the nature of the ground; and the idleness of\r\n  the people of the country, is not the least. We have had about thirty\r\n  men employed, and are not yet able to go more than a mile per day. I\r\n  was about writing to the Vice-President, on this subject; but, on\r\n  second thoughts, concluded it best not to do it: I wish, however, that\r\n  council would, by some official letter, urge us to proceed with all\r\n  the dispatch consistent with the accuracy they expect.\r\n\r\n  “I wish to write to B***** and H****; but you will not readily imagine\r\n  how little leisure I have: Tired of the exercise of the day, I rejoice\r\n  at the approach of night; and, after a cup of tea, generally lie down\r\n  to rest as soon as it is dark, unless we have observations to make;\r\n  and then we have generally half a mile to walk, through dark woods,\r\n  from the place of observation to our encampment: this, however, does\r\n  not happen above once in a fortnight.\r\n\r\n                   “Sun, gallop down the western skies;\r\n                   Go quick to bed, and quickly rise;”\r\n\r\n  Until you bring round the happy day, that will restore me again to the\r\n  dear woman and children I so much love.\r\n\r\n  “Give my love to my children, and the few friends that are really\r\n  concerned for my welfare. God bless you, and make you at least as\r\n  happy as I am; and then, I am sure, you will not complain. Your ever\r\n  affectionate\r\n\r\n                                                        “D. RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n  “Mrs. HANNAH RITTENHOUSE.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rittenhouse, being then treasurer of the state, alludes to those\r\n  incessant demands on the treasury for money, which, by reason of the\r\n  financial embarrassments of the government, at that period, could not\r\n  be always punctually paid. The activity, and the very intelligent mind\r\n  of Mrs. Rittenhouse, both prompted and enabled her to relieve her\r\n  husband from much of the perplexity, which at that time attended the\r\n  duties of state-treasurer. Indeed, it was owing to the great attention\r\n  of that excellent woman to some of the more important transactions of\r\n  the office, and her capability to manage and superintend the current\r\n  business of that department of the public affairs, in the absence of\r\n  her husband from home, or when incapacitated by bodily indisposition\r\n  from personally attending, that the government was enabled to avail\r\n  itself, in several instances, of the talents and services of Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse, in matters of high importance to the community, which\r\n  required the aid of his abilities. On such occasions, he ever found\r\n  Mrs. Rittenhouse a competent, as well as a most faithful assistant, in\r\n  the business of the treasury.\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  So he then used to call his nephew, the present Professor Barton.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  Mr. A. was a worthy and pleasant man: but, he was an old bachelor.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\nThe other letter, dated at the “Head Waters of Buffalo,” the thirteenth\r\nof July, is as follows.\r\n\r\n  “My dearest H,\r\n\r\n  “I need not say how much I feel for you, on account of the\r\n  disagreeable situation in which you last wrote. The only advice, I\r\n  believe, which I thought it necessary to give you, at leaving you, was\r\n  to keep up your spirits and endeavour to bear the fatigues of the\r\n  office. What will you say, or what will you think, when I tell you, I\r\n  believe it scarcely possible for any thing to contribute so much to\r\n  reconcile me to your absence, as the aversion I have to the plagues of\r\n  that same office.\r\n\r\n  “You have heard the reports concerning the Indians. We are still\r\n  ignorant of the true state of matters; but, from every information we\r\n  can get, it seems very improbable that we shall cross the Ohio this\r\n  summer: on this side of the river, we do not apprehend the least\r\n  danger.\r\n\r\n  “On Saturday last, we suddenly emerged from the gloomy, uncultivated\r\n  desert, into a habitable country; and encamped with joy in an open\r\n  field where we could once more see the heavens around us,—a sight we\r\n  had not been blest with, for five weeks past. Wheat, rye, and\r\n  Indian-corn, growing, afforded a very pleasing sight; even the barking\r\n  of dogs and crowing of cocks were agreeable. The next day being\r\n  Sunday, several of the neighbours, their wives and daughters, paid us\r\n  a visit; and amongst them, at least one spruce young lady, bred at the\r\n  metropolis, Fort-Pitt.[225] But would you believe it? such is my\r\n  unreasonable and incurable aversion to company, that their visits soon\r\n  became irksome. They hindered me from enjoying a lonely walk, or some\r\n  passage in Milton,—or, perhaps, a loll on my bed. Nay, even our\r\n  fellow-commissioners, the Virginians, I mean; I sometimes wish their\r\n  wine was better, and flowed more plentifully: not that I might enjoy\r\n  it with them; but that I might enjoy myself the more, alone.\r\n\r\n  “Whether you will believe me or not, I do not know; but my health is\r\n  really much better. As I told you in my last, my old complaint is the\r\n  only one I have; and this is, and has been for several weeks,\r\n  infinitely more supportable, than I have known it for months together.\r\n  I do not, indeed, flatter myself with a cure; it is, in all\r\n  probability, fixed for life: but an alleviation of the pain I have\r\n  usually felt, is to me of much importance.\r\n\r\n  “We have, for three weeks past, had a much greater proportion of dry\r\n  weather; and in this country, when it does not rain, the sky is always\r\n  fair, of a beautiful blue, and the air serene. There has been nothing\r\n  like a storm, nor scarce a puff of wind, since we came here. Though\r\n  thunder, lightning, and rain, are so very frequent, they are never\r\n  attended with high winds, nor scarcely a perceptible motion of the\r\n  air. For a month past, we had a very decent woman to cook for us, but\r\n  some little family broils obliged us to pack her home again. Our boys\r\n  have, however, learnt from her to bake good bread, and to cook much\r\n  better than they did. I mention this, because you will be pleased with\r\n  any thing that can contribute to my comfort.\r\n\r\n  “I expect several opportunities of writing, before we reach the Ohio,\r\n  none of which shall be neglected. I must lay down the pen, to retire\r\n  to rest after the fatigues of the day. Wishing you a very good night,\r\n  I conclude, &c. your ever affectionate\r\n\r\n                                                     “DAVID RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n  “MRS. RITTENHOUSE.”\r\n\r\n  “P. S.

Dr. Ewing, and Thomas Hutchins, Esq. afterwards\r\nGeographer of the United States, a commissioner “for running a line of\r\njurisdiction between the states of Massachusetts and New-York,\r\nconformably to the laws of the said states.” This appointment was made\r\non the 2d day of December, 1785.[226] It was not, however, until the\r\nyear 1787, that the legislature of New-York ceded to the state of\r\nMassachusetts all the lands within their jurisdiction, Westward of a\r\nmeridian to be drawn from a point in the Northern boundary of\r\nPennsylvania, eighty-two miles West from the river Delaware; excepting\r\none mile along the Eastern side of the Niagara river; and also ten\r\ntownships between the Chenengo and Owegy rivers; reserving the\r\njurisdiction to the state of New-York: a cession which was made to\r\nsatisfy a claim of Massachusetts, founded upon their original charter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\n  By an agreement, entered into, on the 18th of May, 1773, between\r\n  commissioners appointed by the legislatures of New-York and\r\n  Massachusetts, respectively, for the settlement of a partition-line of\r\n  jurisdiction between those (then) provinces, on the eastern part of\r\n  New-York, and from the southern to the northern boundaries of\r\n  Massachusetts, (then called Massachusett’s Bay;) in compliance with\r\n  the king’s recommendations, which had been previously signified to sir\r\n  Henry Moore, and Francis Barnard, Esq. the then governors of those\r\n  provinces. The commissioners, on the part of New-York, were John\r\n  Watts, Robert R.

These gentlemen met, in pursuance of their appointment, at\r\n  Hartford in the (then) province of Connecticut, where, after divers\r\n  conferences, they concluded on the following line, as the one which\r\n  should, at all times thereafter, be the line of jurisdiction between\r\n  Massachusetts and New-York, wheresoever the latter, on its eastern\r\n  boundary, should adjoin on the former: that is to say, beginning at a\r\n  place fixed upon by the two governments of New-York and Connecticut,\r\n  about the year 1731, for the north-western corner of a tract of land\r\n  commonly called the Oblong, or Equivalent Land; and running from that\r\n  corner, north, 21° 10′ 30″ east (as the needle then pointed,) to the\r\n  northern line of Massachusetts. This agreement was ratified by the\r\n  governors of Massachusetts and New-York, on the same day; and\r\n  commissioners were accordingly appointed by both provinces, before the\r\n  revolution, to run the line thus defined. It was, in part, then\r\n  effected; but those commissioners not having been able to proceed, by\r\n  reason of an eventual disagreement between them, this line was finally\r\n  run out, surveyed, ascertained and marked, by the commissioners\r\n  appointed by congress, whom the two governments concerned had\r\n  empowered to make such appointment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis line was accordingly run, in the year 1787, by the commissioners so\r\nappointed for the purpose:—And “this last business, which was executed\r\nwith his usual precision and integrity”—says Dr. Rush, speaking of Mr.\r\nRittenhouse,—“ was his farewell peace-offering to the union and\r\nhappiness of his country.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until the year 1786, that the American Philosophical Society\r\nwere enabled to publish a second volume of their Transactions:[227] it\r\nthen made its appearance. Into that volume is introduced a letter to the\r\nSociety, in the original Latin, (accompanied with an English\r\ntranslation,)[228] from the celebrated C. Mayer, the Elector\r\nPalatine’s[229] Astronomer at Manheim, dated so long before as the 24th\r\nof April, 1778. The receipt of that letter had been acknowledged by Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, according to a special order of the Society, so early as\r\nthe 20th of August, 1779; and the answer, it is presumable, was duly\r\ntransmitted to Mr. Mayer. Yet, although there was a lapse of seven\r\nyears, from the date of Mr. Rittenhouse’s letter to the time of Mr.\r\nMayer’s communication being printed in the Society’s Transactions, the\r\nformer was, by some unaccountable circumstance, omitted and unnoticed!\r\nNor will the reader’s surprise on this occasion be diminished, when he\r\nlearns, that a member of the Society, having obtained from Mr.\r\nRittenhouse a copy of his letter, had it read at their stated meeting on\r\nthe 16th of March, 1792,—twelve years and a half after its date; that it\r\nwas, thereupon, “referred to the committee of selection and\r\npublication:” and, notwithstanding, by some other fatality, that letter\r\nremained unpublished until now; being twenty-one years afterwards!\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:\r\n\r\n  In the beginning of the same year, Mr. Rittenhouse was elected one of\r\n  the twelve Counsellors of the American Philosophical Society; an\r\n  office in that institution, created by the incorporating act of the\r\n  15th of March, 1780.\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:\r\n\r\n  There was some unaccountable mismanagement in the whole of this\r\n  business, on the part of the society. Mr. Mayer’s letter is published\r\n  entire, in the original Latin: but the translation ends, abruptly, in\r\n  the middle of a paragraph. When Mr. Rittenhouse was directed by the\r\n  society to answer that letter, he requested the writer of these\r\n  memoirs to furnish him with an English translation of it, for the\r\n  purpose of comparing with it one which he had himself attempted. That\r\n  translation (which, by Mr. Rittenhouse’s desire, was made to conform\r\n  pretty closely to the original,) is inserted in the Appendix, entire,\r\n  together with the hitherto unpublished answer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 229:\r\n\r\n  Charles Theodore, Duke of Bavaria, who is denominated by Lalande, “an\r\n  illustrious patron of the sciences.”\r\n\r\n  It is about fifty years since this prince built an observatory near\r\n  the gardens of Schwetzingen, two leagues from the city of Manheim; and\r\n  there Father Christian Mayer pursued his astronomical labours for\r\n  several years. But about the year 1772, the same prince erected\r\n  another and a more magnificent edifice (of 108 Rhenish feet in\r\n  height,) at Manheim, for the same purpose: where Father Mayer made\r\n  numerous and highly estimable observations; as may be collected from\r\n  his work, entitled, _De novis in Cælo Siderio Phænomenis_. Lalande\r\n  places this observatory in N. Lat. 49° 29′ 15″.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn a perusal of the answer to Mr. Mayer’s communication (in the\r\nAppendix,) it will be found, that the “eminent utility,” which he\r\nexpected to result, at some future day, to astronomical science, from a\r\nprosecution of such discoveries as he had recently made among the fixed\r\nstars, had been long before anticipated by our Astronomer. In that\r\nanswer Mr. Rittenhouse mentions, that he is induced to request his\r\ncorrespondent’s acceptance of a copy of the Oration he had delivered\r\nbefore the American Philosophical Society, “some years”\r\nbefore:—“because,” says the writer, “I therein gave my opinion, that the\r\nfixed stars afforded the most spacious field for the industry of future\r\nastronomers; and expressed my hopes, that the noblest mysteries would\r\nsometime be unfolded, in those immensely distant regions.”\r\n\r\nThis early opinion of his own concerning the fixed stars, to which Mr.\r\nRittenhouse refers in his letter, is expressed in his Oration, in this\r\nshort paragraph: “If astronomy shall again break those limits that now\r\nconfine it, and expatiate freely in the superior celestial fields,—what\r\namazing discoveries may yet be made among the fixed stars! That grand\r\nphænomenon the Milky way, seems to be the clue, that will one day guide\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the expectations entertained by our Philosopher, more than\r\nthree years before the date of Mr. Mayer’s communication of his\r\ndiscovery to the Philosophical Society;—a discovery which Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, in his letter to that great astronomer, styles “excellent;”\r\nand one that proves his own “presage” to have been well founded. He, at\r\nthe same time, modestly suggests to Mr. Mayer, the institution of a\r\ncomparison between the many observations he had already made, in order\r\nto determine, whether the several changes observed will agree with any\r\nimagined motion of our system; remarking, that those he had\r\ncommunicated, seemed to favour such a supposition.\r\n\r\nHow important soever, in relation to astronomy, the phænomena observed\r\nby Mayer may be, the honour of first discovering them certainly belongs\r\nto him. Mr. Rittenhouse was not the discoverer: nor had he ever access\r\nto so complete and expensive an astronomical apparatus, as that used by\r\nMayer on the occasion, and with which he was furnished by means of\r\nprincely munificence. But all candid men of science will, nevertheless,\r\nbe disposed to allow the American Astronomer no inconsiderable share of\r\nmerit for the early “presage,” which his deep-discerning and vastly\r\ncomprehensive mind enabled him to suggest, of some such future\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nThe writer of these memoirs deemed it his duty to do justice to the\r\nmemory of the subject of them, by giving publicity to these interesting\r\ncircumstances; and the performance of this duty is the more gratifying\r\nto the writer, because he alone possesses a knowledge of all the facts\r\nhe has stated, concerning them.\r\n\r\nThe late discoveries of Dr. Herschel, among the fixed stars, in addition\r\nto those previously made by Mr. Mayer, have in a greater degree realised\r\nthe expectations which were formed, many years before either, by our\r\nAstronomer; such, indeed, as are almost entitled to the character of\r\nprescient annunciations, respecting that portion of the heavens which\r\nshould, some time or other, be the scene of the most important\r\nastronomical discoveries. According to Herschel, the Milky Way is an\r\nimmense nebula, near one of the sides of which, is placed the solar\r\nsystem; and he imagines, that each nebula, of which he had observed more\r\nthan nine hundred, consists of a group of suns, with their attendant\r\nplanets!\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse never possessed the means of acquiring such stupendous\r\nand costly telescopes, as those used by Herschel, for the purpose of\r\nexploring the heavens. But the penetrating genius of our countryman\r\nseems to have contemplated, by anticipation, the actual existence of\r\nthose sublime phænomena, some of which the vastly superior instruments\r\nof the Germano-Anglican Astronomer have since manifested; when, in\r\nlanguage apparently prophetic, but certainly dictated by the most\r\nexalted pre-conceptions of the grandeur of celestial objects which were\r\nyet undiscovered, the American Philosopher observes, as he does in his\r\nOration,—that “all yonder stars innumerable, with their dependencies,\r\nmay perhaps compose but the leaf of a flower in the Creator’s garden, or\r\na single pillar in the immense building of the Divine Architect.” Well\r\nmight he exclaim, with rapturous extacy, after so beautiful and sublime\r\na reflection,—“Here is ample provision made for the all-grasping mind of\r\nman!”\r\n\r\nIt will be evident to such as duly reflect on this subject, that those\r\nexpectations which occupied the mind of Mr. Rittenhouse, so long since\r\nas the year 1775—concerning the “amazing discoveries” which should, at\r\nsome future period, be made among the fixed stars, were not mere\r\nconjectures or vague hypotheses; but, that they were rational\r\nanticipations of realities, founded on the most acute observation and\r\nlaborious research, as well as the profoundest philosophical judgment.\r\nAs Newton is said to have revealed those truths in physics, which his\r\npredecessor, Bacon, had preconceived; so, that great practical\r\nastronomer, Herschel, and some other eminent observers of our day,[230]\r\nhave been enabled, by means of the very important improvements recently\r\nmade in astronomical instruments,[231] to verify a grand hypothesis in\r\nhis favourite science, which had long before been conceived by the\r\ntowering genius of Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:\r\n\r\n  Among those who have observed, since Dr. Herschel’s discovery of the\r\n  Georgium Sidus, new phænomena in the heavens, may be ranked the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n  M. Piazzi, a Sicilian astronomer, who, on the 1st of January, 1801,\r\n  discovered a small planet revolving round the sun, between the orbits\r\n  of Jupiter and Mars, named Ceres: Dr. Olbers, of Bremen, who, on the\r\n  28th of March in the following year, discovered another small planet,\r\n  to which he gave the name of Pallas, which revolves round the sun\r\n  nearly at the same distance, and in the same time, as Ceres; and\r\n  afterwards, viz. on the 29th of March, another planet, which he called\r\n  Vesta; similar to the others, both in its position and magnitude: and\r\n\r\n  Mr. Harding, of Lilienthal, who, between these two last mentioned\r\n  periods, viz. on the 1st of September, 1804, discovered a fourth\r\n  planet (but the third in the order of time,) also small, to which he\r\n  gave the name of Juno; resembling Pallas in a great excentricity of\r\n  its orbit, and the inclination of this to the ecliptic, and placed at\r\n  nearly the same distance from the sun.\r\n\r\n  The Georgium Sidus was not discovered until about fifteen years before\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse’s death; and the first discovered of the four last\r\n  mentioned planets was not known in America, for almost five years\r\n  after that event.\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  “There is perhaps no individual of the present age,” (says the writer\r\n  of the article “Astronomy,” in the New Edinburgh Encyclopædia, now\r\n  publishing under the direction of Dr. Brewster,) “to whom practical\r\n  astronomy owes deeper and more lasting obligations, than to Mr. Edward\r\n  Troughton. The great improvements which he has made upon astronomical\r\n  instruments, and the extreme accuracy with which he divides them, have\r\n  rendered his name celebrated in every part of Europe, and have\r\n  inspired the practical astronomer with a confidence in his\r\n  observations, which he had hitherto been unaccustomed to feel. There\r\n  is scarcely an observatory of any consequence, either in this country”\r\n  (Great-Britain,) “or the continent, that does not contain some of Mr.\r\n  Troughton’s instruments; and there are few series of observations, in\r\n  which they have not been used. The admirable observations of Mr. Pond,\r\n  on the declinations of the principal stars, were made with an azimuth\r\n  circle of Mr. Troughton’s construction. The mural circle, which Mr.\r\n  Groombridge of Blackheath uses, in his numerous and accurate\r\n  observations, was made by the same artist. The splendid mural circle,\r\n  of 6 feet 2 inches radius, which Mr. Troughton is at present preparing\r\n  for the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, will cost 700_l._”\r\n  (equivalent, in money of the United States, to $311111/100,) “and will\r\n  be one of the most magnificent and accurate instruments that has ever\r\n  been erected.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom the time our astronomer became established in Philadelphia, until\r\nthe year 1787, he resided in a house belonging to the late Mr. Thomas\r\nClifford, at the south-east corner of Arch and (Delaware) Seventh\r\nstreets: But the mansion which Mr. Rittenhouse had erected for himself,\r\nthe preceding year, on his Observatory-lot at the diagonal corner of\r\nthose streets, being then compleated, he removed thither; and there\r\ncontinued his residence, during the residue of his life. It was about\r\nthis time, perhaps towards the close of the year 1786, that he was\r\ncompelled by the duties of his office, as sole trustee of the\r\nloan-office, to put in suit the bonds which accompanied the mortgages of\r\nsundry delinquent loanees. The bonds were placed in the hands of the\r\nWriter of these Memoirs, for that purpose; with instructions to treat\r\nthe delinquents with every reasonable degree of forbearance. This lenity\r\nwas observed, agreeably to Mr. Rittenhouse’s desire; few suits were\r\ninstituted, and payment of the monies due, or the greater part of them,\r\nwas not long after obtained.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1787, the expected appearance of a new comet in that\r\nyear, engaged Mr. Rittenhouse’s attention: and on that occasion he\r\naddressed the following letter to Mr. Ellicott.\r\n\r\n                                         “_Philadelphia, Feb. 12, 1787._\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  “The elements of the new Planet have been pretty well determined by\r\n  several European astronomers.

A\r\nshort time before this event, the Writer of these Memoirs visited the\r\ncity of New-York; where the first congress, chosen under the present\r\nconstitution of the United States, were then convened, having commenced\r\ntheir session on the fourth day of March preceding: and on that\r\noccasion, Mr. Rittenhouse addressed a letter to General Washington, then\r\nPresident of the United States, recommendatory of his friend and nephew.\r\nDelicacy forbids this relative to present to public view that portion of\r\nthe letter, which more especially relates to himself: but the\r\nintroductory part of it is here presented to the reader, for the purpose\r\nof testifying the continuance of the high esteem entertained for the\r\ntruly great man to whom it was addressed, by one who never disguised his\r\nsentiments. This extract is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                     “_Philadelphia, Aug. 14, 1789_[234]\r\n\r\n  “Sir,\r\n\r\n  “However unwilling I am to add to that multitude of letters which must\r\n  encroach so much on your precious time, I cannot altogether forbear,\r\n  without doing violence to my feelings.

Major-General Arthur St.\r\n  Clair, who may, in some respects, be considered as a modern\r\n  Bellisarius, was at the same time appointed, in like manner, to be\r\n  governor of that territory.[234a] The writer declined the honour\r\n  intended for him by this appointment, which was unsolicited on his\r\n  part: he resigned it in a day or two after.\r\n\r\n  The promptitude with which this mark of president Washington’s\r\n  approbation of the person recommended to him by Mr. Rittenhouse, was\r\n  bestowed, is an evidence of the respect in which the president held\r\n  that gentleman’s recommendation; and it is the more so, as Mr.\r\n  Rittenhouse’s letter was the only one addressed to the president on\r\n  that occasion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 234a:\r\n\r\n  For many interesting particulars concerning the sufferings and\r\n  ill-requited services of this respectable veteran—of a man who once\r\n  filled the chair of congress, and uniformly possessed the friendship\r\n  and confidence of WASHINGTON, see his _Narrative_, lately published.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, 1789, the following letter from Mr.\r\nRittenhouse, offering his resignation of the office of treasurer of the\r\nstate, was presented to the general assembly; and, after having been\r\ntwice read, was, by order of the house, entered on their minutes.\r\n\r\n                                                     _November 9, 1789._\r\n\r\n  “Sir,\r\n\r\n  “On account of the very unfavourable state of my health, as well as\r\n  because I most earnestly wish to devote some of the few remaining\r\n  hours of my life to a favourite science, I find myself under the\r\n  necessity of declining the office of treasurer.\r\n\r\n  “I have now held that office for almost thirteen years, having been\r\n  annually appointed by the unanimous voice, so far as I know, of the\r\n  representatives of the freemen of this state; a circumstance I shall\r\n  ever reflect on with satisfaction, and which does me the greatest\r\n  honour.\r\n\r\n  “I will not pay so ill a compliment to those I owe so much, as to\r\n  suppose the principal motive in these repeated appointments was any\r\n  other than the public good; but I am nevertheless very willing to\r\n  believe, that a regard to my interest was not wholly out of view. And\r\n  I shall, perhaps, never have another opportunity of expressing, with\r\n  so much propriety, my sincerest gratitude to the representatives of my\r\n  countrymen, whose favour I have indeed often experienced on other\r\n  occasions.\r\n\r\n  “I accepted the treasury, when it was attended with difficulty and\r\n  danger, and consequently when there was no compensation for it. Soon\r\n  afterwards, a depreciated currency, prodigiously accumulated, made it\r\n  extremely burthensome, without any prospect of profit.\r\n\r\n  “In a more favourable situation of our affairs, it might have been\r\n  lucrative, had not the very small commissions allowed by law, been\r\n  scarcely equal to the risk of receiving and paying. In 1785, my\r\n  commissions were increased, and the office was for some time\r\n  profitable; but the difficulties or remissness in collecting the\r\n  public revenues, again reduced it to a very moderate compensation.\r\n\r\n  “If, however, the embarrassments of the office have, in general, been\r\n  little understood by those not immediately concerned in it; if the\r\n  emoluments of it have been greatly exaggerated in the public opinion;\r\n  I am still the more obliged to the several assemblies, who, under\r\n  these impressions, have nevertheless continued me so long their\r\n  treasurer.\r\n\r\n  “The confidence of the public I have ever esteemed so invaluable a\r\n  possession, that it has been my fixed determination not to forfeit it,\r\n  by any voluntary act of impropriety. Where my conduct has been\r\n  deficient in the discharge of my duty, I hope it will be imputed to\r\n  want of ability, and not of integrity.\r\n\r\n  “Fully sensible of the importance of the office I have the honour to\r\n  hold, I cheerfully commit it into the hands of those who properly are,\r\n  and ever must be, the guardians of the public good. I am, sir, with\r\n  great respect, your most obliged and very humble servant—\r\n\r\n                                                      “DAVID RITTENHOUSE\r\n\r\n  “The honourable the Speaker of the Assembly.”\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the year 1777, at which period Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nwas invested with the treasurership of his native state, until the month\r\nof September following, when its capital was actually possessed by the\r\nBritish army, that city was in imminent danger of an hostile invasion.\r\nWhen it was reduced to a moral certainty, that the speedy occurrence of\r\nsuch an event was inevitable, he had retired with the treasury (as\r\nbefore noticed) to Lancaster, as a place of security; where he remained\r\nuntil the succeeding summer: when, after the evacuation of the capital\r\nby the British forces, he returned thither, and replaced the treasury in\r\nits ancient seat. The time, therefore, at which he accepted the office\r\nof treasurer, was truly one of “difficulty and danger.”\r\n\r\nThat it was not, for many years, a lucrative place, must be apparent\r\nfrom the ever memorable circumstance of the great and unexampled\r\ndepreciation of that species of paper-currency, called continental\r\nmoney;[235] which was the only circulating medium of the United States,\r\nuntil the year 1782, when the bank of North America went into operation.\r\nThe vast accumulation in the treasury, of that depreciated and daily\r\ndepreciating substitute for money, must necessarily have been “extremely\r\nburthensome” to the treasurer, and could not have afforded him “any\r\nprospect of profit,” during the first five years of his tenure of the\r\noffice. And it was not, in fact, until those last few years, which\r\nconstituted the interval between the time of augmenting the commissions\r\nand his retirement from the office, that the treasurership was\r\nprofitable to him. During the greater part of the time he held it, the\r\nprofits of the office did not enable him to employ even a clerk: nor\r\ncould he have performed the numerous and laborious duties of that\r\nstation (such as they then were,) had he not been greatly assisted by\r\nthe assiduity, care and abilities, of an excellent woman—Mrs.\r\nRittenhouse. Singular as this circumstance may appear, this notice of it\r\nseems due to the memory of an highly meritorious wife; while, on the\r\nother hand, it must be acknowledged, that it does not reflect any honour\r\non the liberality of a great, wealthy, and populous state. Such a man as\r\nDavid Rittenhouse ought to have been otherwise employed, by a generous\r\nand enlightened public: the exercise of his transcendent talents, in\r\nworks of great and permanent public utility, would not only have\r\nconstituted services which would have entitled him to a bountiful\r\nremuneration; but such as would have conferred great additional benefits\r\nand honours on his country.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 235:\r\n\r\n  According to Dr. Ramsay, “the depreciation began at different periods\r\n  in different states; but, in general, about the middle of the year\r\n  1777, and progressively increased for three or four years.” In the\r\n  first four or five months of 1780, it depreciated to 50 or 60 for one.\r\n  “Its circulation,” continues Dr. Ramsay, “was afterwards partial; but,\r\n  where it passed, it soon depreciated to 150 for one. In some few\r\n  parts, it continued in circulation for the first four or five months\r\n  of 1781; but in this latter period, many would not take it at any\r\n  rate, and they who did, received it at a depreciation of several\r\n  hundreds for one.”\r\n\r\n                                                      _Hist. Am. Revol._\r\n\r\n  In October, 1779, it was resolved by congress, that no further sum in\r\n  this paper-money should be issued, on any account whatever, than\r\n  would, when added to the sum then in circulation, amount to 200\r\n  millions of dollars. In their circular letter of the 13th of September\r\n  preceding, addressed to their constituents, congress asserted the\r\n  practicability of redeeming all the continental bills at par, with\r\n  gold and silver; and rejected, with indignation, the supposition that\r\n  the states would ever tarnish their credit by violating public faith.\r\n  “These strong declarations in favour of the paper-currency,” says Dr.\r\n  Ramsay, “deceived many to repose confidence in it, to their utter\r\n  ruin.” In addition to the amount of many millions of dollars, in\r\n  paper-emissions of the several states, congress, soon after, actually\r\n  continued to issue their own paper, until it amounted in the whole to\r\n  the enormous sum of 200 millions of dollars! That which was of little\r\n  value before, now became of less, and soon afterwards good for\r\n  nothing. The inevitable consequence was, that thousands of meritorious\r\n  citizens were entirely ruined, and others greatly injured in their\r\n  property.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThat he should have had, in thirteen years, successively, an unanimous\r\nannual vote for the office of treasurer, is a very strong testimonial of\r\nthe exalted sense which his countrymen entertained of his integrity: it\r\nwould have been so, under a popular government, at any period. But when\r\nit is considered, that, during the whole of the time he held the\r\ntreasurership, the people of Pennsylvania were divided into two opposing\r\nparties, which sprung into existence with the adoption of the\r\nstate-constitution of 1776, the unanimity of their representatives in\r\nfavour of this individual, is still more conclusive evidence of his\r\nmerits. Most of those men in the community, best acquainted with human\r\nnature, and practically versed in the science of politics, very early\r\npointed out the radical defects of the new frame of government; and\r\npredicted the utter incompetency of that instrument, as they conceived,\r\nto promote the true interest and happiness of civil society. In a single\r\nlegislative body, a plural executive, and in a limited duration of the\r\njudicial authority—consequently, an undue dependence of the judges on\r\nthe executive for their re-appointment,—they foresaw those evils, which\r\nwere too soon realized: and in a septennial council of censors, such as\r\nthat constitution provided for,[236] they beheld a political chimera, at\r\nvariance with common sense and the experience of mankind. Men\r\nentertaining these views, formed, of course, one of these parties.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 236:\r\n\r\n  The judiciary is the only department of government, in a republic, the\r\n  officers of which ought (conformably to the principles of that form of\r\n  government) to be permanent in their stations. Judges, in order to\r\n  secure their independence, and thereby enable them to administer\r\n  justice faithfully and impartially, should hold their offices _quamdiu\r\n  se bené gesserint_: and, should they violate the condition of this\r\n  tenure, the constitution should provide, as that of Pennsylvania, in\r\n  conformity to those of the union as well as her sister states, does,\r\n  that they should no longer continue in office. Thus, this branch of\r\n  the government would have formed the only safe and effectual check,\r\n  against such unconstitutional attempts as might be made upon the\r\n  chartered rights of individuals or the public, by either the\r\n  legislative or executive power. But, unfortunately, the dependent\r\n  nature of the judiciary, under the constitution of 1776, rendered it\r\n  incompetent to that end. Hence, as was noticed by the writer of these\r\n  memoirs on a former occasion,[236a] “the framers of the first\r\n  constitution of the state of Pennsylvania discovered the indispensable\r\n  necessity of providing some tribunal for preserving the constitution\r\n  entire. They accordingly instituted a periodical body, in the nature\r\n  of a judicial inquest, and styled the council of censors; whose duty\r\n  it was, “to enquire whether the constitution had been preserved\r\n  inviolate in every part; and whether the legislative and executive\r\n  branches of government had performed their duty, as guardians of the\r\n  people, or exercised other or greater powers, than they were entitled\r\n  to by the constitution.” “This censorial tribunal was, however, ill\r\n  calculated to answer the purposes of its institution. It was, itself,\r\n  a temporary body, appointed immediately by the people. In the\r\n  alternation, and casual ascendency, of different parties in the\r\n  country, a contingency inseparable from the nature of a popular\r\n  government, the council of sensors became the representatives of the\r\n  passions, the prejudices, the political interests, of whatever party\r\n  might happen to be the predominant one at the moment of their\r\n  election. If this should prove to be the same party with that which\r\n  had borne the sway, during the seven years immediately preceding their\r\n  election, they would be disposed to sanction the proceedings of that\r\n  party: otherwise, they would be likely to censure and pronounce\r\n  unconstitutional, the official measures of an adverse party, without\r\n  just cause, impelled thereto by a spirit of party-hostility.\r\n\r\n  “Under a government thus constituted, all would be uncertain and\r\n  insecure. From the deficiency of one stationary and independent\r\n  department in its administration, the rights of the people and the\r\n  best interests of the state would, eventually, become the sport of\r\n  opposite and contending parties; these rights and interests would be\r\n  sacrificed at the shrine of some desperate and unprincipled faction;\r\n  the constitution itself, destitute of any steady disinterested support\r\n  against their machinations, would be overthrown: till, finally, the\r\n  people, having no longer any rallying point of security for their\r\n  persons or property, would be driven from anarchy and licentiousness\r\n  into the arms of despotism.\r\n\r\n  “It is further worthy of remark, that the council of censors was an\r\n  inefficient and a nugatory tribunal, in one most important particular:\r\n  Numerous unconstitutional acts of the legislature might have been\r\n  carried into effect, and have had their complete operation, attended\r\n  by the most unjust and ruinous consequences, before they could be even\r\n  pronounced unconstitutional.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 236a:\r\n\r\n  In a pamphlet, entitled “The Constitutionalist; addressed to men of\r\n  all parties in the United States”—published in Philadelphia, in the\r\n  year 1804.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe other was composed of the projectors of the constitution of 1776,\r\nand other speculative politicians; together with all those whom they\r\nwere enabled to influence, through the medium of their prejudices, their\r\ninexperience or their interests.\r\n\r\nThese two parties continued to divide the state, until the adoption of\r\nthe fœderal constitution. The great and multiplied evils which resulted\r\nto the people of the United States, after the restoration of peace, and\r\nwhich had also been severely felt during the greater part of the war,\r\nfrom the inefficacy of the original confœderation of the States, had\r\nconvinced all thinking men of the necessity of forming a more energetic\r\nnational government, as the only remedy for those evils. And the actual\r\nformation of such a government, aided by the long experience which the\r\ncitizens of Pennsylvania had then acquired, of the injurious effects of\r\ntheir own existing constitution, disposed them soon after to establish\r\nthe present constitution of the state, which was done in convention on\r\nthe 2d of September 1790; a form of government, free from the palpable\r\nerrors of the preceding one, and much more consonant to the genius and\r\nspirit of the fœderal constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, a very extraordinary circumstance, and one that reflects\r\ngreat honour on the character of Mr. Rittenhouse, that, in the long\r\ncourse of years during which the people of Pennsylvania were thus\r\ndivided into two contending parties, he alone could unite the favourable\r\nopinion of both parties, respecting his superior claims to hold one of\r\nthe most important offices in the government.\r\n\r\nAlthough little more than six years and an half intervened, from the\r\ntime of Mr. Rittenhouse’s resigning the treasurership of the state,\r\nuntil the period of his decease, literary and other public honours then\r\nflowed in upon him. He enjoyed, likewise, the satisfaction of\r\nexperiencing, during that short interval, multiplied proofs of the\r\nesteem in which his abilities and character were held, both at home and\r\nabroad. And, notwithstanding it appears to have been his wish, when he\r\nretired from the treasury, to decline for the future any official\r\nsituation, or public employment of any kind, not connected with science;\r\nin order that he might, without interruption, devote the remainder of\r\nhis life to his favourite pursuits; a variety of public trusts, some of\r\nthem requiring arduous duties, were constantly pressed upon his\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nShortly before he resigned the treasurership, the degree of Doctor of\r\nLaws was conferred on Mr. Rittenhouse, by the College of New-Jersey: his\r\ndiploma bears date the 30th of September, 1789. This respectable\r\nseminary had given him the degree of Master in the Arts, seventeen years\r\nbefore[237]; and this new honour was a further pledge of the high\r\nestimation in which he continued to be held by the regents of the\r\ninstitution. His diploma for the Doctorate has a place in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 237:\r\n\r\n  In September, 1772.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe College at Princeton, in New Jersey, then possessed—as she still\r\ndoes—the first Orrery constructed by Dr. Rittenhouse; a monument of his\r\ngenius and abilities, that seemed to give him a just claim to this\r\nhighest academical honour, appropriate to his character, which the\r\ncollege could confer.\r\n\r\nThis institution, called Nassau Hall, was founded about the year 1738;\r\nbut its original charter was enlarged by Governor Belcher, in 1747. The\r\npresident and trustees of Nassau Hall possessed a power, by their\r\ncharter, of granting to “the students of the college, or to any others\r\nthought worthy of them, all such degrees as are granted in either of the\r\nuniversities, or any other college, in Great Britain.” This privilege,\r\nit is believed, was not enjoyed generally—if at all, in any other\r\ninstance[238], by the American colleges, before the revolution; as it is\r\nsupposed they were restricted, prior to that era, to the conferring of\r\ndegrees in the Arts only. But all the superior seminaries of learning,\r\nin the United States, now possess the right of creating Bachelors and\r\nDoctors, in Divinity, Law, and Medicine: and it is greatly to be wished,\r\nthat they may always dispense these high academic honours with\r\nimpartiality and a due discretion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 238:\r\n\r\n  Unless, perhaps, in that of King’s College (now Columbia College,) in\r\n  New-York.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe college-edifice at Princeton is a stately and durable one,\r\nconstructed of stone; and it will afford satisfaction to the reader, to\r\nbe informed, that in this building is deposited the Rittenhouse Orrery.\r\nHe will derive additional pleasure from learning, that this grand\r\nmachine has, lately, been repaired in some considerable degree, and at a\r\ngreat expence, by the ingenious Mr. Henry Voight, of the Mint: by whom,\r\nthat belonging to the University of Pennsylvania, has likewise been put\r\nin good order. Neither of these Orreries appeared to have suffered any\r\nmaterial injury from the British troops, during the war of the\r\nrevolution; though it has been generally believed, they did. The\r\nlibraries, indeed, and some of the apparatus, belonging to both the\r\ncolleges in which the Orreries are placed, experienced great losses from\r\nthe presence of an hostile army in their vicinity: but the officers of\r\nthat army seem to have respected these greater works of human\r\ningenuity.[239]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 239:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Morse observes, that, before the American war, the College of\r\n  New-Jersey was furnished with a philosophical apparatus, valued at\r\n  more than thirteen hundred dollars; “which, except the elegant Orrery\r\n  constructed by Mr. Rittenhouse,” says the Doctor, “was almost entirely\r\n  destroyed by the British army, in the late war; as was also the\r\n  library, which now” (this was in 1789) “consists of between two and\r\n  three thousand volumes.”\r\n\r\n  With a view to the obtaining, with greater certainty, information\r\n  respecting the condition &c. of the Orrery in Princeton College, the\r\n  writer of these memoirs addressed a letter on the subject, to his\r\n  worthy and much respected friend, the Rev. Samuel Stanhope Smith, D.\r\n  D. then president of that institution:[239a] To that letter the\r\n  learned president promptly returned the following answer:\r\n\r\n                                              _Princeton_, May 3d, 1812.\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  “I just redeem a moment, before the closing of the mail, to inform\r\n  you, that Dr. Rittenhouse’s Orrery cost at first 300_l._ Pennsylvania\r\n  currency. It was his own moderate price, and immediately paid him by\r\n  Dr. Witherspoon,[239b] on behalf of the College.\r\n\r\n  “The Orrery was very much injured during the revolutionary war: but\r\n  has been since partly repaired by a gentleman in your city,[239c] who\r\n  formerly worked with Dr. Rittenhouse, and under his direction, in its\r\n  fabrication. The injuries which it received were comparatively small,\r\n  by the British soldiery. A guard was set to protect it: and the\r\n  officers were said to be contemplating its removal to England; this,\r\n  at least, was the general report and opinion. The principal injury was\r\n  produced by our own militia, when the college was appropriated as a\r\n  barrack for them. Many of the wheels were seen to be taken off, as\r\n  handsome curiosities. This, however, was no more than was to be\r\n  expected from a number of ignorant men, so imperfectly disciplined as,\r\n  at that time, they were.”\r\n\r\n                                   “I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                     Your friend and very humble serv’t.\r\n                                               SAMUEL S. SMITH.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 239a:\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Ashbel Green, D. D. of Philadelphia, has since been appointed\r\n  to the Presidentship of the College at Princeton, on the resignation\r\n  of Dr. Smith.\r\n\r\nFootnote 239b:\r\n\r\n  The President of the College.\r\n\r\nFootnote 239c:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Henry Voight.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn the first day of January, 1790,[240] Dr. Rittenhouse was elected one\r\nof the Vice-presidents of the American Philosophical Society; his\r\ncolleagues, in this office, being the Rev. William Smith, D. D. and John\r\nEwing, D. D. both of them able and distinguished astronomers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 240:\r\n\r\n  It was in the autumn of this year that the second (and youngest\r\n  surviving) daughter of Dr. Rittenhouse was married to the late\r\n  Nicholas Baker Waters, M. D. of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis appointment he held but one year; in consequence of the death of\r\nDr. Franklin,[241] on the 17th day of April following.[242]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 241:\r\n\r\n  A very eloquent and interesting Oration on this occasion, being an\r\n  eulogium on Dr. Franklin, was delivered on the 1st of March, 1791,\r\n  before the American Philosophical Society and agreeably to their\r\n  appointment, by the Rev. William Smith, D. D. then one of the\r\n  vice-presidents of the society; for which the orator received their\r\n  unanimous thanks.\r\n\r\n  In a note addressed to the public by Dr. Smith, and prefixed to this\r\n  eulogium in the first volume of his works, the Doctor acknowledges the\r\n  assistance derived by him, in its composition, “from the friendly\r\n  communications of some of his learned colleagues, among the officers\r\n  of the American Philosophical Society:” viz. David Rittenhouse, Esq.\r\n  LL.D. President of the Society; Thomas Jefferson, Esq. LL.D. one of\r\n  the Vice-Presidents; Jonathan Williams, Esq. one of the Secretaries;\r\n  and Benjamin Rush, M. D. one of the Council. To Dr. Rittenhouse, he\r\n  makes his acknowledgements, “for sundry papers, which have been\r\n  digested into the account of Dr. Franklin’s _Electrical and\r\n  Philosophical Discoveries_;” which occupy six or seven pages of the\r\n  printed eulogium.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse was well acquainted with the principles of\r\n  Electricity; at least, so far as they appear to be hitherto\r\n  understood. It is believed that, pretty early in life, he acquired a\r\n  knowledge of this branch of science; which he occasionally cultivated\r\n  afterwards. A letter written by Dr. Franklin to Mr. Landriani, on the\r\n  utility of electric conductors, will serve to shew, that “our\r\n  astronomer” (as Franklin styled him) had employed the instrumentality\r\n  of his “telescope,” in observing some of the effects of lightning.\r\n  This letter, which is dated “Philadelphia, Oct. 14, 1787”, is in these\r\n  words:\r\n\r\n  “I have received, sir, your excellent dissertation on the utility of\r\n  electric conductors which you have had the goodness to send me, and I\r\n  have read it with much pleasure. I beg leave to return you my sincere\r\n  thanks for it.\r\n\r\n  “I found, on my return to this country, that the number of conductors\r\n  was much increased, the utility of them having been demonstrated by\r\n  several experiments, which shewed their efficacy in preserving\r\n  buildings from lightning. Among other examples, my own house one day\r\n  received a severe shock from lightning: the neighbours perceived it,\r\n  and immediately hastened to give assistance, in case it should be on\r\n  fire; but it sustained no damage: they found only the family much\r\n  frightened by the violence of the explosion.\r\n\r\n  “Last year, when I was making some addition to the building, it was\r\n  necessary to take down the conductor: I found, upon examination, that\r\n  its copper-point, which was nine inches in length and about one third\r\n  of an inch in diameter in the thickest part, had been almost entirely\r\n  melted, and very little of it remained fixed to the iron rod. This\r\n  invention, therefore, has been of some utility to the inventor; and to\r\n  this advantage is added, the pleasure of having been useful to others.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Rittenhauss,[241a] our astronomer, has informed me, that having\r\n  observed with his excellent telescope several conductors which were\r\n  within his view, he perceived that the points of a certain number of\r\n  them had been in like manner melted. There is no instance where a\r\n  house furnished with a complete conductor has suffered any\r\n  considerable damage; and those even which had none have been very\r\n  little injured, since conductors have become common in the city.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 241a:\r\n\r\n  So written by Dr. Franklin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  The body of Dr. Franklin was interred in the cemetery belonging to\r\n  Christ-Church in Philadelphia, under a plain marble tomb-stone,\r\n  inscribed with only his name, the time of his decease, and his age.\r\n  But the following epitaph on himself was written by him, many years\r\n  before his death. As it contains a pretty allusion, typically\r\n  expressed, to his belief in the Immortality of the Soul, it may not be\r\n  deemed superfluous to add, on the present occasion, the testimony of\r\n  this philosopher in concurrence with Rittenhouse’s, on that subject.\r\n  If the doctrine had needed any further verification than before\r\n  established it, the suffrages of two such men as FRANKLIN and\r\n  RITTENHOUSE could scarcely fail to remove the doubts of the most\r\n  sceptical.

He was accordingly elected to be President, at\r\nthe stated annual meeting of the Society for the purpose of chosing\r\ntheir officers, held in January, 1791. On being notified of this\r\nappointment, he addressed the following letter to Mr. Patterson, one of\r\nthe secretaries of the Society.\r\n\r\n                                          “_Philadelphia, Jan. 22 1791._\r\n\r\n  “Sir,\r\n\r\n  “I am extremely sensible of the honour the members of the\r\n  Philosophical Society have done me, by electing me their President, in\r\n  the room of that very worthy patron of the Society, the late Doctor\r\n  Franklin.\r\n\r\n  “They have, by this act of theirs, laid an additional obligation on me\r\n  to promote the interests of the institution, by the best means in my\r\n  power, to which I shall ever be attentive; though my ill state of\r\n  health will frequently deny me the pleasure of attending the stated\r\n  meetings.\r\n\r\n  “I send you, herewith, two letters which you will please to\r\n  communicate to the society.—I am, Sir, your very humble servant.\r\n\r\n                                                    “DAVID RITTENHOUSE.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n“In this elevated situation, the highest that Philosophy can confer in\r\nour country,” says his learned and eloquent Eulogist,[243] “his conduct\r\nwas marked by its usual line of propriety and dignity.”—“Never,”\r\ncontinues his Eulogist, “did the artificial pomp of station command half\r\nthe respect, which followed his unassuming manners in the public duties\r\nof this office. You will,” says he, “often recollect, Gentlemen, with a\r\nmixture of pleasure and pain, the delightful evenings you passed in the\r\nSociety, every time he presided in your meetings. They were uniformly\r\ncharacterized by ardour in the pursuits of science, urbanity, and\r\nbrotherly kindness.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Benjamin Rush, M. D.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAbout the time of Dr. Rittenhouse’s elevation to the Presidency of the\r\nPhilosophical Society, and indeed pretty generally afterwards, the\r\ndelicate state of his health confined him much to his house and his\r\nobservatory. On a dry day, he would, occasionally, walk a little abroad;\r\nin the proper seasons, he would now and then recreate himself in a\r\npretty little flower-garden adjoining his house, which Mrs. Rittenhouse\r\ntook pleasure in decorating. His evenings were uniformly passed at home;\r\nexcept at the times of the stated meetings of the Philosophical Society,\r\nwhen he usually attended, if the weather permitted.\r\n\r\nBesides a few of his most intimate friends, who were in the habit of\r\nvisiting him pretty often towards the close of the day[244], many\r\nstrangers of distinction, and persons who had no particular claims upon\r\nhim on the score of friendship, made him occasional visits at other\r\ntimes: but in such portions of his time as he could retrench from these\r\navocations, he was much employed in reading; and the books he read\r\ncomprehended works of literature, taste, and science. He blended the\r\n_utile cum dulci_, in the choice of his subjects; and while he devoted\r\nsome of what might be called his leisure hours, such as were abstracted\r\nfrom his more appropriate pursuits, to works of amusement, he did not\r\nneglect studies of a more serious and important nature. He was at no\r\nloss for books: independently of his own collection, he had ready access\r\nto two valuable and extensive public libraries[245]; those of several\r\nliterary gentlemen were open to him; and some of his friends\r\noccasionally supplied him with new publications. The following note\r\naddressed to him by Mr. Jefferson, in the beginning of the year 1791,\r\nwill shew that Dr. Rittenhouse then devoted some attention to chemistry,\r\nand that he continued to read works of natural science, in French, as\r\nwell as in his own language.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:\r\n\r\n  Of those gentlemen who were among Dr. Rittenhouse’s more particular\r\n  acquaintances, and with whom he maintained the closest friendship,\r\n  few, if any, visited him more frequently than the late Francis\r\n  Hopkinson, Esq.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Hopkinson was a man of genius, taste and learning. He possessed an\r\n  exuberance of refined and genuine wit, rarely to be met with; and his\r\n  vein for satire, which was always applied to useful ends, was almost\r\n  unrivalled. His knowledge of music was correct and extensive, both in\r\n  the theory and practice of that art; and he had also a critical\r\n  acquaintance with painting, as well as a good judgment, in relation to\r\n  the fine arts in general. These qualifications and attainments, united\r\n  with a vivacious temper, a knowledge of mankind, and a love of virtue,\r\n  rendered him a pleasing companion: but the more solid acquirements in\r\n  literature and science, of which, also, he possessed a very\r\n  considerable share, made his society not less interesting than\r\n  agreeable. No one set an higher value on Dr. Rittenhouse’s talents and\r\n  virtues, than this gentleman; their esteem was mutual; and a constant\r\n  and intimate friendship long subsisted between them.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Hopkinson held an appointment in the Loan-office of Pennsylvania,\r\n  for some years. He afterwards succeeded George Ross, Esq. in the\r\n  office of Judge of the Admiralty, for that state. In this station he\r\n  continued until the year 1790; when President Washington, by whom he\r\n  had the honour to be much esteemed, conferred on him the place of\r\n  Judge of the District Court of the United States, for Pennsylvania:\r\n  which important office he held during the remainder of his life. A\r\n  collection of Judge Hopkinson’s writings, on various subjects, was\r\n  made after his death, and published in the year 1792, in three octavo\r\n  volumes; constituting a curious and entertaining miscellaneous work.\r\n  He died on the 8th of May, 1791, in the fifty-third year of his age,\r\n  and somewhat more than five years before his venerated friend,\r\n  Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Hopkinson was one of the executors of Dr. Franklin’s Will; but he\r\n  survived the Doctor little more than a year.\r\n\r\nFootnote 245:\r\n\r\n  Belonging to the Library Company of Philadelphia, and to the American\r\n  Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“TH. JEFFERSON sends to Mr. Rittenhouse Bishop Watson’s essay on the\r\nsubjects of chemistry, which is too philosophical not to merit a half an\r\nhour of his time, which is all it will occupy. He returns him Mr.\r\nBarton’s papers[246], which he has perused with great pleasure; and he\r\nis glad to find the subject has been taken up by so good a hand: he has\r\ncertainly done all which the scantiness of his materials would admit. If\r\nMr. Rittenhouse has done with the last number of the Journal de\r\nPhysique, sent him by Th. J. he will be glad to receive it, in order to\r\nforward it on to Mr. Randolph: if not done with, there is no hurry.\r\n\r\n“Monday morning.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 246:\r\n\r\n  The papers, referred to by Mr. Jefferson, were “Observations on the\r\n  probabilities of the Duration of Human Life, and the progress of\r\n  Population, in the United States of America;” addressed, in the form\r\n  of a Letter, to Dr. Rittenhouse, Presid. of the Am. Philos. Society,\r\n  and afterwards published in the third volume of the Society’s\r\n  Transactions.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\nThe relation in which Dr. Rittenhouse now stood to the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, of which he had attained to the honour of being\r\nthe President, renders it proper that some account should be given, in\r\nthis place, of an institution heretofore distinguished by its\r\nTransactions. The following are the leading features in its history.\r\n\r\nThis Society was instituted on the 2d day of January, 1769, by an union\r\nof two literary societies that had subsisted some time previously, in\r\nPhiladelphia. In the same year this united body petitioned the general\r\nassembly of the province to grant them the privilege of erecting a\r\nbuilding, suitable for their accommodation, on some part of the\r\nState-House square. But the Library Company of Philadelphia, also a very\r\nuseful and respectable institution and a much older corporation, having\r\nabout the same time made a similar application to the legislature, in\r\ntheir own behalf, the prayer of neither was then granted. The latter\r\nhave, long since, erected for their accommodation a large, commodious\r\nand elegant structure[247], on a lot of ground purchased by them for the\r\npurpose, in the immediate vicinity of the public square originally\r\ncontemplated for its site.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 247:\r\n\r\n  In a niche, over the entrance into the edifice, is placed a Statue, in\r\n  white marble, of Dr. Franklin; presented to the Library Company by the\r\n  late William Bingham, Esq. of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA second petition was presented to the general assembly by the\r\nPhilosophical Society, for the same purpose, soon afterwards; though\r\nwithout success. But, finally, in pursuance of another application to\r\nthe state legislature by the Society, for the same object, a law was\r\nenacted on the 28th of March, 1785; by which a lot of ground (being part\r\nof the State-House Square) was granted to them, for the purpose of\r\nerecting thereon a Hall, Library, &c. “for their proper accommodation.”\r\n\r\nThe ground appropriated by the legislature, for this purpose, contains\r\nseventy feet in front on (Delaware) Fifth-Street, (and nearly opposite\r\nthe Hall of the Philadelphia Library-Company,) and fifty feet in depth;\r\non which the Society erected, between the years 1787 and 1791, a neat,\r\nconvenient, and spacious edifice: it was completed under the direction\r\nand superintendence of Samuel Vaughan, Esq. formerly a vice-president of\r\nthe Society; and by means of this gentleman’s disinterested exertions,\r\nprincipally, somewhat more than $3500 were obtained from about one\r\nhundred and fifty contributors, towards defraying the expense of the\r\nbuilding. Dr. Franklin gave at sundry times, towards this object, nearly\r\n$540 in the whole amount.[248]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 248:\r\n\r\n  The Doctor also made, at different times, valuable donations to the\r\n  Society, in Books and some other articles.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe act of assembly of 1785 having, however, restricted the corporation\r\nof this Society, not only from selling or transferring, but from\r\nleasing, any part of the ground thus granted to them, or of the\r\nerections to be made on it, a supplement to that act was obtained, on\r\nthe 17th of March, in the following year; authorizing the Society to let\r\nout any part of their Building, for such purposes as should have an\r\naffinity to the design of their institution; but restricting the profits\r\narising from any such lease to the uses for which the Society was\r\noriginally instituted. The cellars and some of the apartments in the\r\nhouse, have been leased accordingly; and the profits arising from these\r\nleases constitute a considerable part of the Society’s funds, which are\r\nof very moderate extent. The resident members pay to the Treasurer a\r\nsmall annual assessment, fixed by a by-law of the Society: these\r\npayments, in addition to occasional donations in money, made by members\r\nand others,[249] form the residue of the funds of the Society; besides\r\nwhich, they receive from time to time valuable presents, in books,\r\nastronomical and other instruments, &c. Their library, philosophical\r\napparatus, and collections of various kinds, are now respectable.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 249:\r\n\r\n  It is due to the liberality of the general assembly of 1782-3, to\r\n  notice in this place, that on the 16th of February, 1783, that\r\n  legislative body of Pennsylvania made a grant to the American\r\n  Philosophical Society, of four hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe objects of this institution are readily comprehended, from its name;\r\nthe style of the corporation being—“The American Philosophical Society\r\nheld at Philadelphia, for promoting Useful Knowledge:” And with this\r\nview, in its formation, the fundamental laws (passed on the 3d day of\r\nFebruary, 1769,) direct, that “The members of the Society shall be\r\nclassed into one or more of the following committees:\r\n\r\n  1. Geography, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Astronomy.\r\n  2. Medicine and Anatomy.\r\n  3. Natural History and Chemistry.\r\n  4. Trade and Commerce.\r\n  5. Mechanics and Architecture.\r\n  6. Husbandry and American Improvements.”\r\n\r\nThe same original laws and regulations of the Society indicate the style\r\nof the several officers of the institution, and prescribe the duties of\r\ntheir respective stations: they likewise direct the manner in which the\r\ngeneral economy of the Society shall be managed, and their proceedings,\r\nin the more appropriate business of their institution, arranged and\r\nconducted. “These Rules,” say the Society (in an Advertisement prefixed\r\nto the first volume of their Transactions,) “were adopted from the Rules\r\nof that illustrious Body, the Royal Society, of London; whose example\r\nthe American Philosophical Society think it their honour to follow, in\r\ntheir endeavours for enlarging the sphere of knowledge and useful arts.”\r\n\r\nThe Officers of the Philosophical Society are—a patron, who is the\r\ngovernor of the state for the time being—a president—three\r\nvice-presidents—a treasurer—four secretaries, and three\r\ncurators,—together with twelve counsellors; which last board of officers\r\nwas created by an act of the legislature, in the year 1780, and the same\r\nlaw designates the duties of their appointment.\r\n\r\nThe number of members of this Society is not limited: it consisted of\r\nthree hundred, forty years ago; and, probably, now amounts to about four\r\nhundred and fifty. Of this number, however, a large proportion is made\r\nup of foreigners; many of whom are eminent personages, and men of the\r\nmost distinguished abilities in various departments of science, in\r\ndifferent parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Proceedings, hitherto, of this very respectable association of\r\nliterary and scientific characters, have been published in six[250]\r\nquarto volumes, denominated the “Transactions” of the Society: Besides\r\nwhich, several learned and ingenious Orations—including two or three of\r\nmuch eloquence, under the title of Eulogiums—have been delivered before\r\nthe Society and by their appointment, by members of their body.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 250:\r\n\r\n  Part the 1st of the 6th volume was published in the year 1804, and a\r\n  continuation of that volume, in 1809.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThese outlines will serve to furnish the reader with some ideas of the\r\nnature, condition, and character of an institution, which has, in many\r\nrespects, reflected honour on the country to which it belongs. Its\r\nusefulness,[251] it is earnestly to be wished, will not be suffered to\r\ndiminish, by any declension of that noble ardour in cultivating, that\r\npublic spirit in promoting, learning and science, which, while they\r\nadorn the names of individuals, contribute to the glory of a nation. Let\r\na hope be still cherished, that notwithstanding the tumult, the folly,\r\nand the distractions, which at the present day pervade a large portion\r\nof the civilized world, the period is not remote, when tranquillity,\r\ngood sense and order, shall resume their blest dominion over the conduct\r\nof the too many now infatuated nations of the earth.—Let a belief be yet\r\nencouraged, that under the guidance of a benign Providence, not only the\r\nrising generation will be found zealous to emulate the fair fame of a\r\nFRANKLIN and a RITTENHOUSE; but even, that good and rational men in our\r\nown time, and among ourselves, will continue to cultivate the arts of\r\npeace, and to promote those objects of literature and science, which, at\r\nthe same time they meliorate the heart and elevate the mind, contribute\r\nto the happiness of the individual and the general welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 251:\r\n\r\n  At the death of Hevelius, as Lalande remarks, Europe abounded with men\r\n  of science, whose various nations disputed the glory of important\r\n  discoveries, and of perfecting those which had been already made. The\r\n  Academy of Sciences at Paris and the Royal Society of London produced,\r\n  above all, as the same learned writer further observes, that\r\n  revolution (as he is pleased to term it,) by the great number of\r\n  illustrious men and celebrated astronomers, which they gave to Europe.\r\n  The Royal Society was instituted in the year 1660; and it is deserving\r\n  of notice, that this was the period at which the English nation was on\r\n  the eve of a restoration of their legitimate and orderly government,\r\n  after the boisterous and unhappy times of Cromwell and his pretended\r\n  Commonwealth: The Academy of Sciences was established in 1666; not\r\n  long after France had likewise been distracted by domestic factions;\r\n  but, when the great Colbert had restored the finances of the state,\r\n  and not only invigorated but improved every department of that\r\n  powerful monarchy. Lalande designates this period, as an era\r\n  distinguished for the renewal of astronomy, by the establishment of\r\n  Academies. Such are the proofs of the usefulness of institutions of\r\n  this nature.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse’s attachment to the interests of the institution of\r\nwhich he had been thus recently elected President, was amply manifested\r\nsoon after. In the month of November, of the same year, he presented to\r\nthe Society, the sum of 308_l._ (equivalent to 821⅓ dollars,) for the\r\npurpose of discharging a debt due by their corporation to the estate of\r\nthe late Francis Hopkinson, Esq. the treasurer, then deceased. This\r\nliberal donation was thankfully received; and the acknowledgments of\r\ntheir grateful sense of it were made to the donor, by the following\r\naddress,—expressive as well of their feelings on the occasion, as of the\r\nhigh opinion they entertained of his merits and character.\r\n\r\n“To DAVID RITTENHOUSE, Esq. LL.D. President of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, held at Philadelphia, for promoting Useful\r\nKnowledge.\r\n\r\n“Sir,\r\n\r\n    “The American Philosophical Society embrace the present occasion of\r\na meeting for stated annual business, to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\nletter, dated Nov. 15th, addressed to their treasurer; in which you are\r\npleased to inform him, that you have paid the 308_l._ due to the late\r\nJudge Hopkinson, and will lay the bond and mortgage before the Society;\r\nexpressing your hopes, that this benefaction, on your part, may\r\n“encourage the Society to exert themselves to get rid of some other\r\nheavy debts and incumbrances.”\r\n\r\n“This renewed instance of your liberality joined to the consideration of\r\nthe illustrious part which you have taken in their labours, for many\r\nyears past, has made such an impression upon them, that they are at a\r\nloss in what manner they can best express their gratitude, or their\r\nrespect and veneration for your name.\r\n\r\n“At any time, and in any country, such a “brilliant present” would\r\nindicate a mind that can feel the inseparable connection between\r\nLearning and Human Felicity: But in the present state of our finances,\r\nit is a most important benefaction; and a noble specimen of Literary\r\nPatronage in a young empire, where many other improvements must share\r\nwith the Arts and Sciences, in the public attention and bounty.\r\n\r\n“We are sensible of the necessity of extinguishing the other heavy debts\r\nof the Society, with all possible speed, and have appointed a proper\r\ncommittee for that purpose.\r\n\r\n“Signed in behalf, and by order, of the Society, at a meeting held the\r\n16th day of December, 1791.\r\n\r\n“JOHN EWING, WILLIAM SMITH, TH. JEFFERSON, _Vice Presidents_.\r\n\r\n“JAMES HUTCHINSON, JONATHAN WILLIAMS, SAMUEL MAGAW, _Secretaries_.”\r\n\r\nTo which address, Dr. Rittenhouse returned this answer.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n“The satisfaction I feel, in contributing something towards promoting\r\nScience, the interests whereof are, I am persuaded, inseparable from\r\nthose of humanity, is greatly increased by your very polite approbation.\r\n\r\n“My sincerest wishes are, that you may ever merit public encouragement,\r\nand enjoy the patronage of the generous and the good.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring succeeding Dr. Rittenhouse’s election to the Presidency of\r\nthe Philosophical Society, his name was included, jointly with those of\r\nThomas Willing, Esq. and the late Samuel Howell, Esq. in a commission to\r\nreceive subscriptions, in Pennsylvania, to the Bank of the United\r\nStates. This appointment was made by President Washington, on the 26th\r\nof March, 1791.\r\n\r\nSoon after, he was commissioned by Governor Mifflin to be one of three\r\njoint “Agents of Information,” relating to the business of opening and\r\nimproving certain roads, rivers and navigable waters, in Pennsylvania.\r\nHis colleagues in this commission were the Rev. Dr. William Smith and\r\nWilliam Findley, Esq. and this board of commissioners, whose appointment\r\nbears date the 10th of May, 1794, was erected in pursuance of an act of\r\nassembly, passed the 13th of April, preceding. These gentlemen, it\r\nappears, proceeded on that service; for, about two months after their\r\nappointment, monies were advanced to them, towards defraying the\r\nexpences to be incurred in executing the duties of their commission.\r\n\r\nThese duties, it is believed, were in some way connected with an\r\ninvestigation of the most practicable route for a turnpike-road between\r\nPhiladelphia and Lancaster. A company, which had been formed some time\r\nbefore, for the purpose of constructing such a road, were incorporated\r\nby the governor of the state, by virtue of a law passed the 9th of\r\nApril, 1792. Dr. Rittenhouse was a member of that company, and he\r\nactually superintended the surveyors, who were employed in tracing one\r\nof the then contemplated routes: Dr. Ewing was likewise engaged in the\r\nsame service. Neither of those gentlemen held any appointment for such\r\npurposes, from the managers of the turnpike-company, nor received any\r\ncompensation from them, for their services: it is therefore presumed,\r\nthat Dr. Rittenhouse officiated under the commission last mentioned; and\r\nperhaps Dr. Ewing acted, also, under a similar commission.[252] The\r\nformer, however, was himself one of the board of managers; in which\r\ncapacity he acted as a member of several committees, particularly in\r\n1792: but at the end of that year, he declined to continue any longer a\r\nmanager.[253]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 252:\r\n\r\n  Since the above was written, more satisfactory information has been\r\n  obtained on the subject. The agency of information, to which Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse was appointed (together with the Rev. Dr. Smith and Mr.\r\n  Findley,) in May, 1791, was unconnected with the appointment\r\n  respecting the turnpike road. It appears, that on the 10th of October,\r\n  1791, David Rittenhouse, Esq. the Rev. Dr. John Ewing, and Mr. John\r\n  Nancarrow, were appointed by Governor Mifflin, Commissioners to view\r\n  and mark out a road, from the middle ferry on Schuylkill to the\r\n  borough of Lancaster, by courses and distances, as near to a straight\r\n  line as the nature of the ground and other circumstances would admit;\r\n  and also to view and lay out, in a general plan, the great road at\r\n  that time leading from the city of Philadelphia to the same borough,\r\n  (and now called the old road:) with topographical observations\r\n  thereon, having reference to the practicability and comparative\r\n  circumstances necessary to making turnpikes on the then existing and\r\n  proposed roads; in which, expense and materials were to be attended\r\n  to; together with the plans of the surveys, in profile, of the said\r\n  road or roads: agreeably to a resolution of the general assembly,\r\n  passed on the 30th of September, in the same year. Under commissions\r\n  thus designating their duties, these gentlemen, assisted by surveyors\r\n  and the necessary attendants, proceeded on this service, and\r\n  established that great and important public highway, known by the name\r\n  of the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike Road: their compensation\r\n  for this service, was consequently drawn from the treasury of\r\n  Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  The author was favoured with this information by John Hall, Esq. who\r\n  acted as one of the surveyors on the occasion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  These particulars, respecting Dr. Rittenhouse’s connection with the\r\n  Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike-Company, were obligingly furnished\r\n  to the Memorialist by Mr. William Govett, secretary to the board of\r\n  managers of that company.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been before noticed, that, on the elevation of the College of\r\nPhiladelphia to the grade of an University, by an act of assembly passed\r\nin November, 1779, Dr. Rittenhouse was one of the trustees of the new\r\ninstitution, created by that law. On the 30th of September, 1791, almost\r\ntwelve years afterwards, a compromise was effected between the\r\nrespective advocates of the old and the new institution; a law of the\r\nstate being then passed, “to unite the University of the state of\r\nPennsylvania, and the College, Academy and Charitable School of\r\nPhiladelphia, &c.” By this act, the then existing trustees of each\r\ninstitution were to elect twelve trustees; and the twenty-four persons\r\nwho should be thus chosen, together with the governor of the state for\r\nthe time being, as president of the board, were to be the trustees of\r\nthis united seminary, under the denomination of “The Trustees of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.”\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Dr. Rittenhouse was again chosen a member of the\r\ncorporation, on the part of the University, the election having been\r\nmade the 3d of November, 1791; at which time, Bishop White was president\r\nof the board of the College trustees, and Dr. M‘Kean, late governor of\r\nPennsylvania, of that of the University. By an act of assembly, passed\r\nthe 6th of March, 1789, so much of the act erecting the University, as\r\naffected the charters, franchises and estates of the College of\r\nPhiladelphia, had been repealed, and the powers of the former trustees\r\nrevived: but by the act of 1791, all the estates of the two institutions\r\nwere vested in this one, composed of both.\r\n\r\nThe union of the separate interests of those seminaries, it may be\r\nreasonably expected, will eventually prove a fortunate circumstance:\r\nbecause, by its extinguishing the jealousies and rivalship[254] that\r\nheretofore subsisted between the friends of each, which must, too, have\r\ncontinued to operate, had they remained separate; and, by consolidating\r\ntheir estates and pecuniary resources into one fund, greatly encreasing\r\nthe sphere of their usefulness, beyond the ratio in which they could\r\nhave been enjoyed separately; the important interests of literature\r\nmight be expected to be proportionably advanced. A doubt can not be\r\nentertained, that this was an object very desirable by the benevolent\r\nRittenhouse, as well as by the trustees, generally, of these conjoint\r\ninstitutions.[255]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 254:\r\n\r\n  By the legislative act of the 27th of November, 1779, the charter\r\n  granted to the Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia, by the\r\n  Proprietaries, on the 30th of July, 1753, together with the one\r\n  granted to the College on the 14th of May, 1755, were declared void,\r\n  and David Rittenhouse, Esq. was one of the twenty-five trustees of the\r\n  University, then appointed. Twelve of these twenty-five\r\n  newly-appointed trustees, were such _ex officio_. Dr. Franklin, who\r\n  was one of them, never qualified under this act; and some of the\r\n  others afterwards withdrew.\r\n\r\n  By the law of the 30th of September, 1791, the old College and the new\r\n  University were incorporated: twelve trustees were to be appointed by\r\n  each of these institutions, and reported to the governor before the\r\n  1st of December succeeding, which was accordingly done; and thus the\r\n  union of the two institutions was happily completed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 255:\r\n\r\n  Between the years 1762 and 1774, there were collected for the use of\r\n  the College, chiefly by the agency and zealous exertions of the\r\n  Provost, between fifty and sixty thousand dollars; the much greater\r\n  part of which amount was obtained from contributors in Great-Britain\r\n  and Ireland.\r\n\r\n  It is not precisely known to the writer, what is the present condition\r\n  of the University of Pennsylvania, with which the original College of\r\n  Philadelphia and its appendages are incorporated; but it is believed\r\n  to be prosperous: its medical department is, certainly, in a most\r\n  flourishing state.\r\n\r\n  The persons who may be considered as the Founders of the College, when\r\n  the original institution was incorporated by the name of “The Academy\r\n  and Charitable School of Philadelphia,” were Benjamin Franklin, James\r\n  Logan, Thomas Lawrence, William Allen, John Inglis, Tench Francis,\r\n  William Masters, Lloyd Zachary, Samuel M‘Call, junior, Joseph Turner,\r\n  Thomas Leech, William Shippen, Robert Strettel, Philip Syng, Charles\r\n  Willing, Phineas Bond, Richard Peters, Abraham Taylor, Thomas Bond,\r\n  Thomas Hopkinson, William Plumsted, Joshua Maddox, Thomas White and\r\n  William Coleman. The names of these respectable men, (the meritorious\r\n  promoters of that institution which fostered the genius of a\r\n  Rittenhouse, and with which his name and talents were associated,)\r\n  were deemed deserving of record, as early patrons of learning in\r\n  Pennsylvania. Of this College, the _Alma Mater_ of the memorialist, he\r\n  trusts it will not be thought presumptuous to speak in the language,\r\n  and with the grateful feelings, of one of her Sons,[255a] in an early\r\n  period of his life:\r\n\r\n            “Blest Institution! Nurse of Liberty!\r\n            My heart, my grateful heart shall burn for thee.\r\n            No common pride I boast, no common joy,\r\n            That thy instructions did my youth employ:\r\n            Tho’ not the first, among thy sons, I prove;\r\n            Yet well I feel, I’m not the last in love.\r\n            O may’st thou still in wealth and pow’r encrease,\r\n            And may thy sacred influence never cease!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 255a:\r\n\r\n  The late Francis Hopkinson, Esq. See his Poem entitled, _Science_;\r\n  inscribed to the Trustees, Provost, Vice-Provost, and Professors of\r\n  the College of Philadelphia, A. D. 1762.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt has been already noticed, that the first academic honour conferred on\r\nDr. Rittenhouse, was obtained from the College of Philadelphia: he might\r\ntherefore consider it as being his _Alma Mater_; and his attachment to\r\nthat seminary must have been strengthened, by the circumstance of one of\r\nhis (only two) Orreries having been acquired by it, and its being\r\ndeposited in the college-edifice. But, besides these considerations, he\r\nofficiated, for some time, as Vice-provost and a professor in the\r\ninstitution, after it became an University. To the first of these\r\nstations, he was elected on the 8th of February, 1780; having been\r\nunanimously appointed professer of astronomy, the 16th of December\r\npreceding: a salary of one hundred pounds per annum was annexed to the\r\nvice-provostship, and three hundred pounds per annum to the professor’s\r\nchair. These places Dr. Rittenhouse resigned, the 18th of April 1782.\r\n\r\nThus attached to, and connected with, this very respectable seminary of\r\nlearning, as Dr. Rittenhouse was, the following occurrences in the\r\nhistory of its origin and advancement, will not be deemed uninteresting,\r\nby the reader.\r\n\r\nThe Academy and Charitable School, of Philadelphia, originated in the\r\nyear 1749. This institution, which was opened in that year, was\r\nprojected by a few private gentlemen; and many others, of the first\r\nrespectability, gave their countenance to it, as soon as it became\r\nknown: some of them were, on its first establishment, appointed trustees\r\nof the infant seminary.\r\n\r\nThe persons on whom the charge of arranging and digesting the\r\npreparatory measures for this important undertaking, were Thomas\r\nHopkinson,[256] Tench Francis,[257] Richard Peters and Benjamin\r\nFranklin, Esquires.[258] The last mentioned of these distinguished and\r\npatriotic gentleman draughted and published the original proposals; and\r\non the opening of the Academy, another of them, Mr. Peters, (afterwards\r\nD. D. and rector of Christ’s-Church and St. Peter’s in Philadelphia,)\r\nwho long officiated as provincial secretary, preached an appropriate\r\nsermon—on the 7th of January, 1751—from these words (St. John, viii.\r\n32.) “_And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you\r\nfree._”—“This reverend and worthy gentleman” said Dr. Smith, in his\r\naccount of this institution, first published among his works in the year\r\n1762 “(who, amid all the labours of his public station, as well as the\r\nprivate labours in which his benevolence continually engaged him, has\r\nstill made it his care to devote some part of his time to classical\r\nlearning, and the study of divinity, to which he was originally bred,)\r\ntook occasion, from these words of our blessed Saviour, to shew the\r\nintimate connexion between truth and freedom,—between knowledge of every\r\nkind, and the preservation of civil and religious liberty.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 256:\r\n\r\n  A lawyer of eminence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 257:\r\n\r\n  Then attorney-general of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  In selecting the twenty-four trustees for the proposed Academy, as\r\n  well as in the formation of his plan, Dr. Franklin consulted, besides\r\n  the three gentlemen named with him, in the text, Dr. Phineas Bond, a\r\n  physician of eminence in Philadelphia and a worthy character. The\r\n  trustees, whose names were inserted in the contributions, and which\r\n  were subscribed on the 13th of Nov. 1749, were among the most\r\n  respectable citizens of Philadelphia. The plan of the then projected\r\n  Academy was adapted to “the state of an infant country;” Dr. Franklin\r\n  having considered it as only “a foundation, for posterity to erect\r\n  (thereon) a seminary of learning more extensive, and suitable to\r\n  future circumstances.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Smith, M. A. (afterwards D. D.) was inducted, on the\r\n25th of May, 1754, as head of this seminary, under the title of Provost,\r\nwith the professorship of natural philosophy[259] annexed to that\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May, 1755, an additional charter was granted by the\r\nProprietaries to this seminary, by which a College was engrafted upon\r\nthe original Academy: a joint government was agreed on for both, under\r\nthe style of “The College, Academy and Charitable School, of\r\nPhiladelphia, in Pennsylvania;” and this enlarged institution became\r\ninvested with a power of conferring degrees, and appointing professors\r\nin the various branches of the arts and sciences.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 259:\r\n\r\n  He was, afterwards, also professor of astronomy and rhetoric; and he\r\n  gave lectures in these branches, in addition to natural philosophy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe first commencement, in this College and Academy, was held the 17th\r\nof May, 1757;[260] on which occasion, an excellent charge was delivered\r\nto the graduates, by the Provost. One passage in that charge is so\r\npatriotic and impressive, as to merit attention at all times, in a\r\ncountry that boasts of a free constitution of government; its\r\nintroduction at this time, and on the present occasion, cannot be\r\nconsidered improper: it is the following animated and eloquent\r\nexhortation to active patriotism, in times of misrule, popular delusion,\r\nand public danger:—\r\n\r\n“Should your Country call, or should you perceive the restless tools of\r\nfaction at work in their dark cabals, and ‘stealing upon the secure hour\r\nof Liberty;’ should you see the corruptors, or the corrupted, imposing\r\nupon the public with specious names,—undermining the civil and religious\r\nprinciples of their country, and gradually paving the way to certain\r\nSlavery, by spreading destructive notions of Government;—then, Oh! then,\r\nbe nobly roused! Be all eye, and ear, and heart, and voice, and hand, in\r\na cause so glorious! Cry aloud, and spare not,—fearless of danger,\r\nregardless of opposition, and little solicitous about the frowns of\r\npower, or the machinations of villany. Let the world know, that Liberty\r\nis your unconquerable delight; and that you are sworn foes to every\r\nspecies of bondage, either of body or of mind. These are subjects for\r\nwhich you need not be ashamed to sacrifice your ease and every other\r\nprivate advantage. For, certainly, if there be aught upon earth suited\r\nto the native greatness of the human mind, and worthy of contention,—it\r\nmust be to assert the cause of Religion, and to support the fundamental\r\nrights and liberties of mankind, and to strive for the constitution of\r\nyour country,—and a government of laws, not of Men.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  The following is an extract from the Salutatory Oration delivered by\r\n  Mr. Paul Jackson,[260a] at the first Commencement held in the College\r\n  of Philadelphia; when a Master’s degree was conferred on that\r\n  gentleman, and on him only.\r\n\r\n  After making his salutations of respect to the professors generally,\r\n  the orator thus addressed the Rev. Mr. (afterwards Dr.) Smith, the\r\n  Provost:\r\n\r\n  “Præcipué, Te, collegii et academiæ hujus Præefecte venerande! summâ\r\n  benevolentiâ a nobis observari par est. Tu gressus nostros, dum\r\n  subtilioris sapientiæ recessus curiosé indagamus, direxisti. Tu nobis,\r\n  mansuetioribus musis operam impendentibus, orationis simplicis ac\r\n  perspicuæ regulas, venusta ornamenta ac veneres accuraté eleganterque\r\n  explicuisti. Tu, quid sit magnificum tum in verbis, tum in sententiis,\r\n  tum in figuris, edocuisti, omnesque sublimitatis fontes, ipsius\r\n  Longini majestatem et acumen feliciter æmulatus, auditoribus tuis\r\n  admirantibus retexisti. Qui vult fieri disertus, scripta tua, tanquam\r\n  præceptorum exempla luculenta, sæpius versato; animum intendat ad\r\n  argumenta multifaria, quæ tam varié, tam numerosé, tam abundanter, tam\r\n  illuminaté, tum rebus tum verbis tractasti.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 260a:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Jackson was professor of languages and master of the Latin school,\r\n  in the college, until the spring of the year 1758; when he accepted of\r\n  a captaincy in the provincial service, in the expedition under general\r\n  Forbes, against the French and their Indian allies. On the resignation\r\n  of his professorship, Mr. Jackson was succeeded by Mr. Beveridge.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the year 1765, the original plan of this institution was greatly\r\nenlarged, by the addition of the Medical School;[261] with the\r\nappointment of Professors,[262] for reading lectures in anatomy, botany,\r\nchemistry, the materia medica, the theory and practice of physick, and\r\nalso for delivering clynical lectures in the Pennsylvania Hospital.[263]\r\nSince that period, and after the erection of the whole of the\r\nCollege-establishment into an University, the Medical department has\r\nbeen still further extended, by the creation of other Professorships in\r\nthe Schools of Medicine, and filling these new chairs—as well as those\r\noriginally instituted—with men of distinguished learning and abilities:\r\nBy which means, the Medical School in Philadelphia, connected with the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, now justly vies with that of Edinburgh, in\r\ncelebrity.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 261:\r\n\r\n  Dr. William Shippen, the younger, who first filled the anatomical\r\n  chair in the College of Philadelphia, (afterwards, the University of\r\n  Pennsylvania,) and which he continued to occupy for almost forty-three\r\n  years with great respectability, may be justly considered as the\r\n  founder of the medical department of that institution. The\r\n  establishment of a medical school in his native city, had long been\r\n  contemplated by this distinguished lecturer, as a most desirable\r\n  object: but, in the execution of such a plan, serious difficulties\r\n  were to be encountered at the commencement. In the language of-his\r\n  anonymous eulogist,[261a] “the enterprize, arduous in itself, was\r\n  rendered abundantly more so, in consideration of its novelty: for, as\r\n  yet, the voice of a public lecturer in medicine had never been heard\r\n  in the western world. In order, therefore, to test the practicability\r\n  of the measure, and to pave the way for a more regular and extensive\r\n  establishment, he determined to embark in the undertaking himself, by\r\n  delivering, in a private capacity, a course of lectures on anatomy and\r\n  surgery: this he did in the winter of 1762-3, being the first winter\r\n  after his return from his studies and travels in Europe.”\r\n\r\n  Dr. Shippen’s success, as a private lecturer, demonstrated the\r\n  expediency of engrafting a medical school on the College; and, in\r\n  consequence, he was unanimously elected the professor of anatomy and\r\n  surgery, on the 17th of September, 1765. This able teacher held that\r\n  chair until his death,[261b] which occurred the 11th of July, 1808, in\r\n  the seventy-fifth year of his age.\r\n\r\nFootnote 261a:\r\n\r\n  Said to be Dr. Caldwell, of Philadelphia. See the _Port Folio_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 261b:\r\n\r\n  Casper Wister, M. D. Professor of Anatomy and Surgery in the\r\n  University of Pennsylvania, was, for some years before the death of\r\n  Dr. Shippen, his adjunct professor in the same chair; to which\r\n  station, this eminent teacher in those branches of medicine was\r\n  appointed by the trustees of the university, at the request of his\r\n  late colleague.\r\n\r\nFootnote 262:\r\n\r\n  William Shippen, jun. M. D. just mentioned, was the professor of\r\n  anatomy; Adam Kuhn, M. D. a distinguished pupil of the celebrated\r\n  Linnæus, was professor of botany, united with the materia medica;\r\n  Benjamin Rush, M. D. a learned and able professor of the theory and\r\n  practice of physick, then held the chemical chair; and Dr. Thomas\r\n  Bond, an ingenious and eminent physician, gave clynical lectures in\r\n  the Pennsylvania Hospital. In the year 1789, the trustees of the\r\n  College of Philadelphia instituted a professorship of natural history\r\n  and botany; which was then conferred on Benjamin Smith Barton, M. D.\r\n  Dr. Kuhn had formerly delivered several courses of lectures on botany,\r\n  in the College of Philadelphia; but natural history had never before\r\n  been taught there. On the union of the College with the University, in\r\n  the year 1791, Dr. Barton’s former appointment was confirmed by the\r\n  trustees of the united institution; and in the year 1796, he was\r\n  further appointed by them to the professorship of materia medica; that\r\n  chair having been then vacated by the resignation of the late\r\n  professor of that branch of medical science.\r\n\r\n  The other chairs, in the Medical Department of the University, are\r\n  filled as follows; viz. that of Anatomy, by Casper Wister, M. D.—of\r\n  the Theory and Practice of Physick, by Benjamin Rush, M. D.[262a]—of\r\n  Chemistry, by John Redman Coxe, M. D.—of Materia Medica, Botany and\r\n  Natural History, by Benjamin Smith Barton, M. D.—of Surgery, by Philip\r\n  Syng Physick, M. D. and John S. Dorsey, M. D.—and of Midwifery, by\r\n  Thomas Chalkley James, M. D.\r\n\r\n  Among these collegiate-chairs in medicine, appertaining to the\r\n  University of Pennsylvania, the only one which appears to be deficient\r\n  in a suitable appendage to its institution—and this, too, such an\r\n  appendage as may be considered almost indispensably necessary to it—is\r\n  the Professorship of Botany. To this chair, a _Botanical Garden_ ought\r\n  to be appurtenant: and accordingly we find, that this requisite for\r\n  rendering a Botanical Professorship complete, in most Universities, is\r\n  the establishment of such a Garden, for the use of the Teacher and his\r\n  Pupils.\r\n\r\n  The importance that is attached to institutions of this kind, in\r\n  foreign seminaries of learning, will be perceived from the following\r\n  sketches of those in three of the most celebrated universities of\r\n  Europe.\r\n\r\n  The Botanical Garden (called the “Physick Garden”) of the university\r\n  of Oxford, contains five acres of ground. It is surrounded by a noble\r\n  wall, with portals in the rustic style, at proper distances. The\r\n  passage to the grand entrance is through a small court: this principal\r\n  portal is of the Doric order, ornamented with rustic work, and adorned\r\n  with a bust of Henry Danvers, Earl of Danby, the founder; besides\r\n  statues of the kings Charles I. and II.\r\n\r\n  The ground is divided into four quarters. On each side of the\r\n  entrance, is a neat and convenient green-house, stocked with a great\r\n  variety of exotics. The quarters are filled with indigenous plants,\r\n  properly classed; and without the walls is an admirable hot-house,\r\n  filled with various plants, the production of warm climates.\r\n\r\n  These fine and spacious gardens were instituted by Lord Danby, so\r\n  early as the year 1632; and this nobleman having supplied them with\r\n  the necessary plants, for the use of the students of Botany in the\r\n  university, endowed the establishment with an annual revenue, for its\r\n  support. The Gardens were afterwards much improved by Dr. Sherrard,\r\n  who assigned a fund of 3000_l._ sterling, for the maintenance of a\r\n  professor of Botany. Over the grand entrance into the Gardens is this\r\n  inscription: “_Gloriæ Dei Optimi, maximi honori Caroli I. Regis, in\r\n  usum Academieœ et Reipublicæ, Henricus Comes Danby, anno 1632_.”\r\n\r\n  The Botanic Garden, at Cambridge, consists of nearly five acres, well\r\n  watered. The ground, with a large house for the use of the governors\r\n  and officers of the Garden, was purchased at the expense of about\r\n  1600_l._ sterling, by Dr. Richard Walker.\r\n\r\n  An handsome green-house, one hundred feet in length, and having an\r\n  hot-house (or, what is called a stove,) appurtenant to it, were\r\n  erected by subscription. These are furnished with an extensive variety\r\n  of curious exotics: the plants are all arranged according to the\r\n  Linnæan system, and a catalogue of them is printed.\r\n\r\n  These Gardens are under the government of the chancellor or\r\n  vice-chancellor of the university, the heads of three of the colleges,\r\n  and the regius professor of physick; and they are superintended by a\r\n  lecturer or reader, and a curator.\r\n\r\n  There is, besides, a Professorship of Botany, in this university; as\r\n  there is also at Oxford.\r\n\r\n  The Botanical Garden belonging to the university of Edinburgh, is\r\n  about a mile from the city, It consists of a great variety of plants,\r\n  exotic and indigenous. The Professor is botanist to the king, and\r\n  receives an annual salary of 120_l._ sterling, for the support of the\r\n  Garden. A monument to the memory of Linnæus was erected here, by the\r\n  late Dr. Hope, who first planted the Garden and brought it to\r\n  perfection.\r\n\r\n  The Garden of Plants, at Paris, now termed the Museum of Natural\r\n  History, comprises a space of many acres. It dates its origin as far\r\n  back as the year 1640, during the reign of Louis XIII. In 1665, it\r\n  bore the name of _Hortus Regius_, and exhibited a catalogue of four\r\n  thousand plants. From that period, it made but slow progress, until\r\n  Louis XV. placed it under the direction of the Count de Buffon, the\r\n  celebrated naturalist; to whose anxious care and indefatigable\r\n  exertions, it owes its present extent and magnificence: it is now\r\n  under the patronage of the government.\r\n\r\n  But this institution comprehends, in addition to the Botanical Garden,\r\n  an extensive chemical laboratory, a cabinet of comparative anatomy, a\r\n  cabinet of preparations in anatomy and natural history, a large\r\n  library, a museum of natural history, and a menagérie well stocked.\r\n  Besides the lectures delivered in the Amphitheatre, erected in these\r\n  Gardens, the Professors of Botany give their peripatetic lessons, in\r\n  good weather, to a numerous train of disciples.\r\n\r\n  “When I have been seated at noon, on a fine day, in the month of\r\n  August, or in the commencement of May, under one of the majestic ash\r\n  of the Garden of Plants, with this Elysian scene before me, in the\r\n  midst of a most profound silence, and of a solitude interrupted only\r\n  by the occasional appearance of the Professor of Botany and his\r\n  pupils, I have almost fancied myself,” says the writer of _Letters on\r\n  France and England_—(see Am. Rev. No. ii.) “among the groves of the\r\n  Athenian Academy, and could imagine that I heard the lessons of the\r\n  “divine” Plato. Here, as well as in the spacious and noble works and\r\n  gardens of Oxford, which are so admirably calculated for the exercises\r\n  both of the mind and body, the fancy takes wing, and readily\r\n  transports the student of antiquity to those venerable seats of\r\n  knowledge, where the sublime Philosophy of the Greeks was taught, and\r\n  the masters of human reason displayed their incomparable eloquence:”—\r\n\r\n                             ——“the green retreats\r\n           Of Academus,[262b] and the thymy vale,\r\n           Where, oft enchanted with Socratic sounds,\r\n           Ilyssus,[262c] pure, devolv’d his tuneful stream\r\n           In gentle murmur.”\r\n                        Akenside’s _Pleasures of Imagination_.\r\n\r\n  The importance of establishing a Botanical Garden at Philadelphia is\r\n  obvious: it has, in fact, become a necessary institution, towards\r\n  completing a medical education; according to the system of teaching\r\n  medicine, pursued in the medical department of the University of\r\n  Pennsylvania. In this respect, New-York has taken the lead of\r\n  Philadelphia. Dr. David Hosack, professor of botany in the Medical\r\n  School of New-York, established a Botanic Garden of about twenty\r\n  acres, called the Elgin Botanic Garden, in the vicinity of that city,\r\n  in the year 1801. This Garden is skirted around by forest-trees and\r\n  shrubs, within the substantial enclosure of a stone wall; and on these\r\n  grounds are erected extensive, commodious, and well constructed\r\n  conservatories and hot-houses, which are furnished with a variety of\r\n  plants, exotic and indigenous. The whole of this establishment was\r\n  purchased from Dr. Hosack, by the state, in the year 1810: It is now\r\n  under the direction of the regents of the University of that state.\r\n\r\n  Six years ago, the general assembly of Pennsylvania made some\r\n  provision for such an institution: By a law passed the 19th of March,\r\n  1807, towards the close of Governor M‘Kean’s administration, three\r\n  thousand dollars were granted to the trustees of the University of\r\n  Pennsylvania, “out of the monies they owe the state; for the purpose\r\n  of enabling them to establish a Garden for the improvement of the\r\n  science of Botany, and for instituting a series of experiments to\r\n  ascertain the cheapest and best food for plants, and their medical\r\n  properties and virtues.” But no application of this fund has yet been\r\n  made, to the purposes contemplated by the legislature in their\r\n  appropriation of it.\r\n\r\n  Mr. John Bartram, F. R. S. a distinguished botanist, though\r\n  self-taught, is understood to have been the first anglo-American who\r\n  executed the design of a Botanic Garden in this country. He laid out,\r\n  and planted with his own hands, on his farm, pleasantly situated on\r\n  the west bank of the Schuylkill and about four miles below\r\n  Philadelphia, a garden of five or six acres; which he furnished with a\r\n  great variety of curious, useful and beautiful vegetables, exotic as\r\n  well as American. He acquired the greater part of the latter, in\r\n  travelling through many parts of the continent, from Canada to the\r\n  Floridas. His proficiency in his favourite science was, at a pretty\r\n  early period, so great, that Linnæus pronounced him, in one of his\r\n  letters, to be the greatest natural botanist in the world. This Garden\r\n  is now in the tenure and under the management of his son, the\r\n  ingenious Mr. William Bartram, a well known cultivator of Natural\r\n  History and Botany. Although this respectable man is above seventy\r\n  years of age, he continues the most sedulous attention to his\r\n  favourite pursuits. For a further account of Mr. John Bartram, see Dr.\r\n  Barton’s _Medical Journal_.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Bartram was born near Darby, in the (then) county of Chester,\r\n  Pennsylvania, in the year 1701. He held the appointment of Botanist,\r\n  for America, to King George III. until his death, which occurred in\r\n  September, 1777, in the seventy-sixth year of his age.\r\n\r\nFootnote 262a:\r\n\r\n  Since deceased.\r\n\r\nFootnote 262b:\r\n\r\n  Academus was an Athenian hero, from whom the original Academists, or\r\n  that sect of philosophers who followed the opinion of Socrates, as\r\n  illustrated and enforced by Plato, derived their name; Plato having\r\n  taught his disciples in a grove, near Athens, consecrated to the\r\n  memory of that hero.\r\n\r\nFootnote 262c:\r\n\r\n  The Ilyssus is a rapid, but, when not swollen by rains, a small\r\n  stream, of pure and limpid water, in the vicinity of Athens; and near\r\n  the margin of which, in a vale at the foot of Mount Hymettus, is\r\n  supposed to have stood the Grove, dedicated to Academus, in which the\r\n  Socratic Philosophy was taught in its greatest purity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 263:\r\n\r\n  This highly important and well conducted institution owes its rise to\r\n  the liberal contributions of several humane, charitable and\r\n  public-spirited persons, aided by a legislative grant of two thousand\r\n  pounds, Pennsylvania currency, (equivalent to $5333⅓ in the beginning\r\n  of the year 1751: the first design, it is believed, was suggested by\r\n  the late Dr. Thomas Bond, long an eminent physician in Philadelphia;\r\n  and heretofore an active and useful member of the Philosophical\r\n  Society, as well as sometime one of the vice-presidents of that body.\r\n  By a law passed the 11th of April, 1793, the general assembly\r\n  liberally granted ten thousand pounds ($26,666,) out of the funds\r\n  accruing to the loan office of February 26, 1773; to enable the\r\n  managers of the Hospital to make additions to their buildings,\r\n  conformably to the original plan; and so to extend it as to comprehend\r\n  a Lying-in and a Foundling Hospital,[263a] so soon as specific funds\r\n  for those purposes should be obtained.\r\n\r\n  The first twelve managers (whose names deserve to be held in\r\n  remembrance, as prominent benefactors to their country,) were Joshua\r\n  Crosby, Benjamin Franklin, Dr. Thomas Bond, Samuel Hazard, Richard\r\n  Peters, Israel Pemberton, (then styled junior,) Samuel Rhoads, Hugh\r\n  Roberts, Joseph Morris, John Smith, Evan Morgan and Charles Norris;\r\n  and John Reynell officiated as treasurer: all of these were gentlemen\r\n  of most respectable characters.\r\n\r\n  In order to obviate some objections, that were at first made, to the\r\n  contemplated expense of the medical department of the institution, and\r\n  which it was apprehended might obstruct the passage of the bill then\r\n  depending in the legislature, by which the grant of the two thousand\r\n  pounds, before mentioned, was obtained from the public, Dr. Thomas\r\n  Bond, together with his brother Dr. Phineas Bond, and Dr. Lloyd\r\n  Zachary, generously offered to attend the Hospital, gratuitously, for\r\n  the term of three years.\r\n\r\n  The Hospital establishment is now very complete, according to the\r\n  original plan of this valuable institution; and, indeed, much beyond\r\n  what was at first contemplated, in some respects: yet its utility\r\n  might be much increased, by a further extension of the design. In its\r\n  present condition, however, it reflects great honour on Pennsylvania,\r\n  justly celebrated, as she is, for her charitable, literary,\r\n  scientific, and other useful institutions; and the conduct of the\r\n  managers has been uniformly such, as to entitle them to the gratitude\r\n  of the community.\r\n\r\n  The Students in the Medical School of the University pay ten dollars\r\n  per annum, for the privilege of attending the Hospital-practice, which\r\n  is of very important advantage to them: and the physicians, with the\r\n  managers, have generously appropriated a fund out of the monies, thus\r\n  obtained, for the purpose of founding a Medical Library, and of\r\n  purchasing the late Dr. Abraham Chovet’s most curious anatomical\r\n  preparations.[263b] By these means, in addition to Dr. John\r\n  Fothergill’s valuable present, and other donations, this Hospital,\r\n  with little expense of its more immediate funds, already possesses the\r\n  most useful as well as ornamental collection, of the kind, that is to\r\n  be found any where in America: and when the superbly magnificent\r\n  painting, representing Christ healing the sick, (now in a train of\r\n  execution by Mr. West, in London, and intended to be a donation from\r\n  him to this Hospital,) shall have been received, this _chef-d’œuvre_\r\n  of the sublime artist will constitute there, not only a noble monument\r\n  of his liberality, benevolence, and attachment to his native country,\r\n  but a splendid and admirably well-suited ornament to the institution\r\n  possessing it. It is scarcely sixteen years since the hospital-tickets\r\n  of the medical pupils amounted to only about three hundred dollars per\r\n  annum. This fund has been since increasing; the annual income to it\r\n  being at present estimated at fifteen hundred dollars: it is now amply\r\n  sufficient to supply the library belonging to the Hospital with new\r\n  books, and to keep in good preservation the anatomical casts, &c.\r\n\r\n  As Dr. Franklin was eminently instrumental in promoting the\r\n  establishment of the Pennsylvania Hospital, so he likewise bore a\r\n  conspicuous part in the formation of the Library-Company of\r\n  Philadelphia; an institution which holds a distinguished rank, for its\r\n  usefulness, among the many that do honour to the capital of\r\n  Pennsylvania. A public Library was first set on foot in Philadelphia\r\n  by Franklin, about the year 1731; at which time he was scarcely\r\n  twenty-six years of age. Fifty persons then subscribed forty shillings\r\n  each, and agreed to contribute ten shillings annually, for that\r\n  purpose. Some other companies for similar purposes had been formed in\r\n  that city, after the one here mentioned; but these were soon after\r\n  united with “The Library Company of Philadelphia.” This Company now\r\n  possess many thousand valuable books; and their stock is continually\r\n  deriving accessions from donations, as well as from purchases. Besides\r\n  the marble statue of Dr. Franklin, presented to the company by the\r\n  late William Bingham, Esq. of Philadelphia, (which decorates the front\r\n  of the Library-edifice,) and many other considerable benefactions to\r\n  the institution, from time to time, “the Penn family” (as the late\r\n  ingenious Dr. Henry Stuber, the continuator of the Life of Franklin,\r\n  has remarked,) “distinguished themselves by their donations” to it.\r\n  The Loganian Library was, a few years since, placed under the same\r\n  roof with that of the Philadelphia Company; though in a distinct\r\n  apartment. It consists of an extensive collection of curious, rare and\r\n  valuable books, in various branches of ancient and modern learning:\r\n  and for this noble benefaction to his native country, the public are\r\n  indebted to James Logan, Esq. many years an eminent citizen of\r\n  Philadelphia, and well known, not only throughout America, but in the\r\n  old world, for his erudition and talents.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse’s intimate connexion with the College, and afterwards\r\n  with the University of Pennsylvania, rendered it improper, in the\r\n  opinion of the Memorialist, not to notice those institutions in the\r\n  manner he has done: and in doing this, he could not without injustice\r\n  omit a similar mention of the Hospital, so nearly allied to them\r\n  through the Medical School of the former; nor of the Philadelphia\r\n  Library Company, which bears a close affinity to them all.\r\n\r\n  The name of Mr. West having been introduced on this occasion, the\r\n  writer conceives it will not be thought foreign to the design of these\r\n  Memoirs (though only incidentally connected with the present article),\r\n  to make some further mention of a native American, whose name must\r\n  ever hold a most conspicuous place in the history of the fine arts, in\r\n  relation to this country.\r\n\r\n  This celebrated Artist is the youngest of ten children of John West, a\r\n  person descended from very respectable ancestors, and a native of\r\n  England. John early embraced the tenets of the people called Quakers.\r\n  Migrating, in the year 1714, to Pennsylvania, where some members of\r\n  the same family had arrived with William Penn about fifteen years\r\n  before, he married and settled in the vicinity of Philadelphia; and\r\n  there his son Benjamin was born.\r\n\r\n  This gentleman’s residence has been in England, during the last\r\n  forty-five years: but he left his native country some considerable\r\n  time prior to that period; having first visited Italy, and some other\r\n  schools of painting on the continent. When a Society of Artists was\r\n  instituted in London, a few years after the accession of the present\r\n  king to the throne, Mr. West (who had then recently arrived in\r\n  England, on his return from Italy,) became a member of that body.\r\n  Their exhibitions of painting, sculpture and architectural designs,\r\n  became objects of attention to men of taste in the fine arts;—“the\r\n  young Sovereign,” says Mr. West (in a letter to Mr. C. W. Peale,\r\n  written in 1809,[263c]) “was interested in their prosperity.” After\r\n  the dissolution of that society, the king desired Mr. West and three\r\n  other artists to form a plan for a Royal Academy; which having been\r\n  approved by his majesty, he directed that it should be carried into\r\n  execution. “Thus,” continues Mr. West, “commenced the institution of\r\n  the Royal Academy of London[263d]:” And again, speaking of this\r\n  patronage, he says;—“his majesty, by his regard for the arts, gave a\r\n  dignity to them, unknown before in the country.” Referring to this\r\n  meritorious patronage of the fine arts by the present king of England,\r\n  Mr. Latrobe (in his Anniversary Oration before the Society of Artists\r\n  in Philadelphia, in May, 1811,) makes this just remark: “Nor ought we\r\n  to omit mention of the name of George III. by whose patronage, our\r\n  illustrious countryman, West, has become the first historical painter\r\n  of the age.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 263a:\r\n\r\n  Towards the incorporation of either one or the other of these\r\n  institutions with the present establishment of the Pennsylvania\r\n  Hospital, the managers possess, also, sixteen shares of stock in the\r\n  Bank of Pennsylvania, bestowed by the First Troop of Cavalry in\r\n  Philadelphia. The product of this noble and very valuable donation,\r\n  and which is considered as being equivalent to a capital stock of\r\n  $8503.33, will, most probably, be wholly applied to the support of a\r\n  Lying-in Hospital, as part of the great institution.\r\n\r\nFootnote 263b:\r\n\r\n  Thirty pounds a year were payable to Mrs. Abington, a daughter of Dr.\r\n  Chovet, during her life, on account of this purchase. That annuity has\r\n  very recently been extinguished, by the death of the annuitant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 263c:\r\n\r\n  See the _Port Folio_, for January, 1810.\r\n\r\nFootnote 263d:\r\n\r\n  When this Academy was first established, the celebrated Dr. Samuel\r\n  Johnson was appointed ‘Professor of Ancient Literature’ in the\r\n  institution; an office merely honorary.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe whole of the literary and scientific institution, thus formed—which,\r\nbesides the Medical Schools, was composed of the College, the Academy\r\nand the Charitable School, continued under the provostship of the Rev.\r\nDr. Smith, assisted by able teachers and professors,[264] from his\r\ninduction in the year 1754, until the establishment of the University,\r\nin 1779:[265] during which time, comprehending a period of twenty-five\r\nyears, this seminary increased in reputation and flourished; and indeed\r\nit was indebted for much of its respectability and usefulness to the\r\nzeal,[266] the talents and the services of Dr. Smith.\r\n\r\nFootnote 264:\r\n\r\n  Of these, Francis Alison, D. D. a learned and worthy presbyterian\r\n  clergyman, was vice-provost, and professor of moral philosophy; the\r\n  Rev. Ebenezer Kinnersley, M. A. an eminent electrician and an amiable\r\n  man, was professor of English and oratory; John Beveridge, M. A. an\r\n  excellent scholar in the learned languages (some of whose Latin\r\n  epistolary writings, in metrical language, after the manner of Horace,\r\n  possess a considerable portion of merit and discover much classical\r\n  purity of style,) was professor of languages; and Hugh Williamson, M.\r\n  A. (now M. D.) a gentleman of distinguished talents, was professor of\r\n  mathematics.\r\n\r\n  The last mentioned of these eminently meritorious characters is yet\r\n  living. He enjoys the respect and esteem due to a man who, in the\r\n  course of a long life, devoted much of his time and talents to the\r\n  promotion of learning, useful knowledge, and the welfare of his\r\n  country. Of the other three, who have, long since, passed on to “that\r\n  bourn from which no traveller returns,” the following circumstances\r\n  are worthy of being preserved in remembrance, by those who shall\r\n  hereafter record the history of literature and science, in this\r\n  country.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Alison was one of the first persons in the middle colonies, who,\r\n  foreseeing the ignorance into which this part of the country seemed\r\n  inclined to fall, set up a regular school of education here. He was\r\n  long employed in the education of youth at New-London Cross-roads, in\r\n  Pennsylvania, before his appointment to the vice-provostship of the\r\n  college of Philadelphia; and many persons, who afterwards made a\r\n  distinguished figure in this country, were bred under his tuition. The\r\n  University of Glasgow, being well informed of the pious and faithful\r\n  labours of this valuable man, in propagating useful knowledge in these\r\n  then untutored parts of the world, created him a Doctor of Divinity:\r\n  He was honoured with this degree, without any solicitation whatever on\r\n  his part.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Kinnersley possessed great merit, in the estimation of the learned\r\n  world, “in being the chief inventor of the Electrical Apparatus, as\r\n  well as author of a considerable part of those discoveries in\r\n  Electricity, published by Mr. Franklin, to whom he communicated them.\r\n  Indeed Mr. Franklin himself mentions his name with honour; though he\r\n  has not been careful enough to distinguish between their particular\r\n  discoveries. This, perhaps, he may have thought needless, as they were\r\n  known to act in concert. But, though that circumstance was known here,\r\n  it was not so in remote parts of the world, to which the fame of these\r\n  discoveries has extended.” The passage here quoted, is copied from an\r\n  account of the college and academy of Philadelphia, published in\r\n  October, 1758.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Franklin’s experiment with the electrical kite—which established\r\n  the theory on which the metallic conductors of lightning were\r\n  introduced, for the security of buildings, and those within them, from\r\n  injury by that element—was made in June, 1752; and his letter, giving\r\n  an account of it, is dated the 19th of October following. But Mr. de\r\n  Romas, a Frenchman, to whom his countryman the Abbé Bertholon ascribes\r\n  the honour of the experiment with the kite, made his first attempt on\r\n  the 14th of May, 1753: he did not succeed, until the 7th of the next\r\n  month; a year after Dr. Franklin had completed his experiments, and\r\n  then generally known in Europe. It is noticed by the late ingenious\r\n  Dr. Stuber, of Philadelphia, in his continuation of the Life of\r\n  Franklin, that “his (Dr. Franklin’s) friend, Mr. Kinnersley,\r\n  communicated to him a discovery of” (what Dr. Stuber terms) “the\r\n  different kinds of electricity, excited by rubbing glass and sulphur.”\r\n  This, it is said, was first observed by Mr. Du Faye; though afterwards\r\n  not attended to, for many years. It seems, however, that the\r\n  electricians of Europe, with Du Faye himself, had conceived a mistaken\r\n  notion on this subject; and that Franklin had, at first, adopted their\r\n  doctrine. “But,” says the continuator of his Life, “upon repeating the\r\n  experiments, he perceived that Mr. Kinnersley was right; and the\r\n  vitreous and the resinous electricity of Du Faye were nothing more\r\n  than the positive and negative states which he had before observed;\r\n  that the glass globe charged positively, or encreased the quantity of\r\n  electricity on the prime conductor,—whilst the globe of sulphur\r\n  diminished its natural quantity, or charged negatively.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Beveridge, who was appointed by the trustees of the college and\r\n  academy of Philadelphia, in June, 1758, professor of languages in that\r\n  institution, was one of the ablest masters of the Latin tongue; and\r\n  wrote many poetical pieces in that language, in a style of superior\r\n  purity and elegance. This excellent Latin scholar originally taught a\r\n  grammar-school in Edinburgh, under the patronage of the celebrated Mr.\r\n  Ruddiman. While in that station, he taught the Latin to Mr. Thomas\r\n  Blacklock, the well-known blind poet; and it was during this time,\r\n  that Blacklock wrote his fine paraphrase of Psalm CIV. which his\r\n  friend Beveridge afterwards rendered into Latin verse. A collection of\r\n  Mr. Beveridge’s poetical pieces, under the title of _Epistolæ\r\n  Familiares et alia quædam miscellanea_, was published at Philadelphia,\r\n  in the year 1765.\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  A Law Professorship was instituted in the College of Philadelphia, in\r\n  the year 1790, and the Hon. James Wilson, LL.D. (late one of the\r\n  associate judges of the supreme court of the United States,) was\r\n  appointed the first professor: the first course of lectures, under\r\n  this appointment, was delivered in the winter of 1790-1. In April,\r\n  1792, when the College and University became united into one seminary,\r\n  under the latter title, a Professorship of Law was erected in the new\r\n  seminary; when Judge Wilson was again appointed to fill that chair:\r\n  but no Law-lectures were afterwards delivered.\r\n\r\n  The lectures composed by the able and very learned Judge, for this\r\n  department of the institution, are given entire in his works,\r\n  published in three volumes octavo, in the year 1804, by his son Bird\r\n  Wilson, Esq. president of the seventh judicial district of\r\n  Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  It is much to be regretted, that this important chair in the\r\n  University has remained unoccupied, since the death of its late\r\n  eminent incumbent: For, as he has justly observed, in his\r\n  _Introductory Lecture_, “The science of Law should, in some measure\r\n  and in some degree, be the study of every free citizen, and of every\r\n  free man. Every free citizen and every free man has duties to perform,\r\n  and rights to claim. Unless, in some measure, and in some degree, he\r\n  knows those duties and those rights, he can never act a just and an\r\n  independent part.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 266:\r\n\r\n  In an Account of Dr. Smith, prefixed to his posthumous works, the\r\n  respectable Editor observes—that “Dr. Smith was actuated by a “zeal\r\n  bordering on enthusiasm” (as he himself expressed it), in his devotion\r\n  to the dissemination of literature and science.”\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was educated in the university of Aberdeen,[267] in\r\nScotland, where he graduated as Master of Arts. He soon after obtained\r\nclerical orders, in the Church of England; and, in the year 1759, he was\r\nhonoured with the degree of Doctor in Divinity, from the University of\r\nOxford, on the recommendation of the archbishop of Canterbury, and the\r\nbishops of Durham, Salisbury, Oxford and St. Asaph.[268] About the same\r\ntime, he received a similar degree from the University of\r\nTrinity-College, Dublin. Dr. Smith died the 14th of May, 1803, at the\r\nage of seventy-six years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 267:\r\n\r\n  This University was founded in the year 1480; it consists of two\r\n  colleges, called the Marischal and the King’s College, under the name\r\n  of the University of King Charles. The library belonging to this\r\n  ancient university is large; and in both the colleges, the languages,\r\n  mathematics, natural philosophy, divinity, &c. are taught by able\r\n  professors.\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  These prelates were, respectively, the Doctors—Secker, Trevor, Thomas,\r\n  Hume, and Egerton.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of April, 1792, an act was passed by the general assembly of\r\nPennsylvania, for the purpose of enabling the governor to incorporate a\r\ncompany for opening a canal and water-communication between the rivers\r\nDelaware and Schuylkill: and by this act, David Rittenhouse, William\r\nMoore, Eliston Perot, Cadwallader Evans, jun. and Francis Johnston,\r\nEsquires, were appointed commissioners to receive subscriptions of\r\nstock, for constituting a fund for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThus, after having been engaged in the course of eleven years, at a\r\nprior period, in the improvement of a great natural highway of his\r\nnative country, he was again employed, in conjunction with others, by\r\nthe legislative body of that country, after a lapse of nineteen years\r\nfrom the time of his first appointment to a similar duty, in forwarding\r\nthe great design of uniting more intimately, and more beneficially for\r\nthe purposes of agriculture and commerce, the waters of the beautiful\r\nstream near whose banks he was born, with those of the majestic\r\nDelaware.\r\n\r\nThis comparatively inconsiderable appointment was presently after\r\nsucceeded by a most important one. Dr. Rittenhouse was commissioned to\r\nbe Director of the Mint, by President Washington, the 14th of April,\r\n1792; but he did not take the requisite qualifications for that office,\r\nuntil the 1st of July following. He entered upon the duties of this\r\narduous and very respectable station with great reluctance: it was,\r\nindeed, pressed upon him; not only by Mr. Jefferson, then secretary of\r\nstate, with whom Dr. Rittenhouse had long been in habits of intimate\r\nfriendship; but (through the means of Mr. Secretary Hamilton, of the\r\nTreasury,) by the illustrious President himself, who always entertained\r\nthe highest regard for him: and this esteem was mutual, notwithstanding\r\nsome “shades of difference” in the political tenets of these two great\r\nand good men; for no person could hold a more exalted opinion of the\r\nintegrity, abilities, and public services of Washington, than Dr.\r\nRittenhouse uniformly did. Such was the extreme diffidence with which\r\nour Philosopher accepted this appointment thus honourably conferred on\r\nhim, that he declined, for a considerable time, to be sworn into office;\r\nuntil, finally, on applying to the writer of these memoirs, he obtained\r\nhis promise to render such assistance to him as he should be able to do,\r\nin the event of his own incapacity, from want of health or by reason of\r\nany incidental circumstance, to devote a sufficient portion of his time\r\nto the duties of the station. Although the writer was never required to\r\nact in the capacity thus proposed to him, circumstances not occurring to\r\nrender it necessary, he shall always consider the arrangement then made\r\nupon the subject, on the voluntary proposition of Dr. Rittenhouse, as an\r\nestimable testimonial of his confidence in his friend and relative: yet\r\nthe writer would have introduced the mention of these particulars, into\r\nthe present work, with greater hesitation than he does, did he not\r\nconceive that a statement of facts of this kind will evince the delicate\r\nsensibility of Dr. Rittenhouse, on the occasion.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had determined to accept the Directorship of the Mint, he\r\nbegan to make suitable arrangements for carrying the institution into\r\noperation. Towards this end, he suggested to the secretary of state the\r\nexpediency of purchasing two contiguous houses and lots of ground,\r\nconveniently situated, for the establishment; in preference to taking\r\nbuildings upon lease, for a purpose that seemed to require something\r\nlike a permanent position. His proposal relative to this matter, it\r\nappears, was communicated to the secretary of state, for the purpose of\r\nbeing submitted to the consideration of the President: for, on the 9th\r\nof June, 1792, his approbation of the plan was expressed in the\r\nfollowing note to the secretary.\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  “I am in sentiment with you and the Director of the Mint, respecting\r\n  the purchase of the lots and houses which are offered for sale, in\r\n  preference to renting—as the latter will certainly exceed the interest\r\n  of the former.\r\n\r\n  “That all the applications may be brought to view, and considered, for\r\n  Coining &c., Mr. Lear will lay the letters and engravings before you,\r\n  to be shewn to the Director of the Mint:—I have no other object or\r\n  wish in doing it, than to obtain the best. Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n                                                       “G^o. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. JEFFERSON.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse executed this high trust with great ability and\r\nunimpeachable integrity, during three years; at the expiration of which\r\nhe resigned it, on the 30th of June, 1795. He had, long before,\r\nexpressed his anxious wish to retire from this station; but continued in\r\noffice until that time, on the solicitation of the President and at the\r\nearnest desire of Mr. Jefferson.\r\n\r\nAs he was the first person appointed to that office, after the\r\ninstitution of the Mint under the present federal government of the\r\nUnion, the duties that devolved upon him, in conducting it, were arduous\r\nand complicated. He directed the construction of the machinery; made\r\narrangements for providing the necessary apparatus; and, in daily visits\r\nto the Mint, whenever his health permitted, personally superintended,\r\nwith the most sedulous fidelity, not only the general economy of the\r\ninstitution, but its operations in the various departments;—duties,\r\nwhich his love of system and order, his extensive knowledge, and his\r\npractical skill in mechanicks, eminently qualified him to perform with\r\npeculiar correctness. At those times when he was prevented, by\r\nindisposition, from attending at the Mint in person, reports were made\r\nto him by the proper officers, either verbally or in writing, of the\r\nstate of the institution and the progress of its business; and those\r\nofficers received from him, on such occasions, the instructions\r\nrequisite for their several departments.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the affairs of the Mint, Dr. Rittenhouse was seconded by\r\ncapable and trusty officers; among whom was Mr. Voight, the Chief\r\nCoiner, with whose ingenuity and skill, as an operative mechanic, he was\r\nwell acquainted, having long before employed him in that capacity, while\r\nhe was engaged in constructing one of his Orreries and carrying on other\r\nbranches of his professional business. Dr. Nicholas Way, a physician of\r\nsome eminence, officiated at the same time as Treasurer of the Mint; and\r\nthat respectable co-adjutor of the then Head of this important\r\ninstitution in the national economy, has borne testimony to his\r\nscrupulous attention to the public interests, in its direction:—“I have\r\nbeen informed by his colleague in office, Dr. Way,”—says Dr. Benjamin\r\nRush,[269] who succeeded that gentleman in the Treasurership of the\r\nMint,—“that, in several instances, he,” (speaking of the Director) “paid\r\nfor work done at the Mint out of his salary,[270] where he thought the\r\ncharges for it would be deemed extravagant by the United States.[271]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 269:\r\n\r\n  See his Eulogium on Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 270:\r\n\r\n  His salary was two thousand dollars per annum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 271:\r\n\r\n  A particular instance, of a similar kind, occurred within the\r\n  knowledge of the Memorialist. Mr. Peter Getz was, lately, a\r\n  self-taught mechanic of singular ingenuity, in the borough of\r\n  Lancaster; where he many years exercised the trade of a silver-smith\r\n  and jeweller, and was remarkable for the extraordinary accuracy,\r\n  elegance, and beauty of the workmanship he executed. This person was a\r\n  candidate for the place of chief coiner or engraver in the mint; and,\r\n  on that occasion, he offered to present to Dr. Rittenhouse, in the\r\n  summer of 1792, a small pair of scales—such as are commonly called\r\n  gold-scales—of exquisite workmanship as well as great exactness, as a\r\n  specimen of his skill as an artist. The Director conceived, that an\r\n  instrument equally well suited to the use for which this was designed,\r\n  though less ornamental, could be procured for the mint, if desirable,\r\n  for less money than this was worth as a matter of curiosity; he would\r\n  not, therefore, purchase it for the mint: but being determined not to\r\n  accept it as a present, and desirous at the same time to make\r\n  compensation to the artist for his work, he insisted on his receiving\r\n  twenty dollars for the instrument; on payment of which, he retained it\r\n  himself.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Rittenhouse resigned the Directorship of the Mint, in June\r\n1792, he was succeeded in that office by Henry William De Saussure, Esq.\r\nof South Carolina, a gentleman of distinguished talents and\r\nrespectability. But Mr. De Saussure did not long hold the appointment:\r\nSome invidious and illiberal, as well as ill-founded insinuations, were\r\nsoon cast upon the establishment and the manner in which it was\r\nconducted, by certain persons in the government, who had very early\r\nevinced an hostility to the institution itself; and it is not\r\nimprobable, that some of this description were also influenced in their\r\ninimical views towards it, by personal considerations. Mr. De Saussure,\r\ndisgusted with such unworthy conduct, retired from the Directorship,\r\nafter having held that office only a few months; during which short\r\nperiod, he executed his trust in such a manner, as to obtain the\r\napprobation of President Washington, and entitle him to the public\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, which was addressed by Mr. De Saussure to the\r\neditors of the Charleston City Gazette, and published in that paper,\r\nsoon after his resignation, will serve to elucidate this subject: as a\r\nvindication of that gentleman, and also of his predecessor, from the\r\ninjurious aspersions so unjustly thrown out against the institution of\r\nthe Mint by its enemies, that publication is entitled to a place in the\r\nMemoirs of Rittenhouse; it shall now close the narrative of Dr.\r\nRittenhouse’s connexion with the Mint.\r\n\r\n  “Messrs. Freneau and Payne,\r\n\r\n  “I was filled with no less indignation than surprise, on reading the\r\n  debates in the house of representatives of the United States, on\r\n  Tuesday the 19th of January, respecting the Mint, to find that a good\r\n  deal of censure had been thrown out by some of the members against the\r\n  management of that establishment, in such general and indiscriminating\r\n  terms as might be deemed to implicate me, during the short time I was\r\n  in the Directorship.\r\n\r\n  “Several members spoke in hasty and unguarded terms; and one member,\r\n  whose name the printer had not given, passed all the bounds of\r\n  moderation. He is represented as having said, “that the institution is\r\n  a bad one, and is badly conducted: it had been most scandalously\r\n  carried on, and with very little advantage to the public. If the\r\n  institution is not better carried on than it has been, it ought to be\r\n  thrown aside.”—If I could tamely endure these imputations, which in\r\n  their generality may be supposed to reach me, I should be unworthy the\r\n  esteem of my fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n  “It ought, perhaps, to be sufficient for me to produce to the public\r\n  eye the entire approbation which the President of the United States\r\n  was pleased to express of my conduct, when quitting the office of the\r\n  Director. I laid before him a full and exact state of the situation of\r\n  the Mint, and of the coinage prior to, and during my being in office.\r\n  His approbation is contained in a letter which he wrote me at the\r\n  moment of my leaving Philadelphia,—dated the 1st of Nov. 1795; from\r\n  which these words are an extract—“I cannot, at this moment of your\r\n  departure, but express my regret, that it was not accordant with your\r\n  views to remain in the Directorship of the Mint: Permit me to add\r\n  thereto, that your conduct therein gave entire satisfaction; and to\r\n  wish you a pleasant voyage, and a happy meeting with your friends in\r\n  South Carolina.”\r\n\r\n  “To those who know the President of the United States well,—who know\r\n  the caution with which he is accustomed to speak, and that he\r\n  possesses the talent of correctly estimating, as well as vigorously\r\n  overcoming, the difficulties which present themselves in every\r\n  circumstance of business,—this would rescue any character from the\r\n  unqualified censure of the members of the house of representatives.\r\n  But I will go further, and will shew the grounds on which the\r\n  President formed his judgment, so that every man may form his own\r\n  opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe Writer then proceeds with some details, respecting the condition of\r\nthe Mint on his coming into office, and at the time he left it; in the\r\ncourse of which he states some difficulties, and unavoidable\r\nobstructions to the progress of the coinage, which existed in the time\r\nof his predecessor, and some of which could not be obviated while he\r\nremained in the direction: and to this statement he annexes a table,\r\nexhibiting an account of the gold and silver coinage at the Mint, from\r\nits establishment to the close of October, 1795; at the foot of which he\r\nremarks, that “there never was any period at which the Mint was supplied\r\nwith bullion, in a state for coinage, sufficient to keep it regularly\r\nand fully employed for any considerable time; except,” continues the\r\nwriter, “near the close of my direction; to wit, from the 1st to the\r\n24th of October.” Mr. De Saussure thus concludes his very satisfactory\r\nletter on this subject:\r\n\r\n  “Whilst I am vindicating myself from the censure, indiscriminately\r\n  thrown upon the management of the Mint, I do by no means concede that\r\n  the censure is justly applicable to my respectable predecessor. The\r\n  solid talents of Mr. Rittenhouse will be remembered with pride, and\r\n  his mild virtue recollected with tenderness, by his countrymen, when\r\n  many of his censors will be forgotten in the silent dust. His lofty\r\n  and correct mind, capable alike of ascending to the sublimest heights\r\n  of science, and of condescending to regulate the minute movements of\r\n  mechanical machinery, organized the Mint, and created the workmen and\r\n  the apparatus; amidst the complicated difficulties from which the most\r\n  persevering minds might have shrunk without dishonour. A very long and\r\n  debilitating state of ill health prevented him from giving the\r\n  establishment all the activity of which it was susceptible; and he\r\n  long wished to retire before he was permitted. His country suffered\r\n  him to retire, without remembering, that it was the duty of a liberal\r\n  nation to provide an independent retreat in his old age, for one of\r\n  the noblest of her Philosophers; and to this neglect, it is attempted\r\n  to add unmerited obloquy.\r\n\r\n  “I quit the ungrateful theme with disgust. I am consoled by the\r\n  approbation of _him_, by whom to be approved, will gladden the heart\r\n  through a long life. I rejoice that I quitted an office which subjects\r\n  its holder to such unjust censure, by the advice of my friends, who in\r\n  prophetic spirit told me, ‘that such offices were suited to men who\r\n  could bear up against censure, though they did not deserve it,’ which\r\n  they did not believe me formed to endure.”\r\n\r\n                                                 “HENRY WM. DE SAUSSURE.\r\n\r\n  Charleston, S. C. Feb. 5. 1796.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\nA national coin having been always considered as a proper, if not an\r\nabsolutely necessary, attribute of the sovereignty of a state,[272] the\r\nestablishment of a Mint, for the United States, was pretty early\r\ncontemplated. A plan for that purpose was brought into the view of\r\ncongress, in the last year of the war; although no national coinage was\r\ninstituted until ten years afterwards. The early part of the year 1780\r\nwas extremely disastrous to the affairs of the United States. The fall\r\nof Charleston, S. C. depressed the spirits of the country: and the\r\nalmost total failure of public credit, accompanied by a want of money,\r\nand other means of carrying on the war, about that period, paralyzed the\r\nmeasures of the government. Such was the apathy of the public mind, in\r\nregard to the perilous condition of the country at that crisis, that\r\nmany members of the general assembly of Pennsylvania, which was convened\r\non the 10th of May, in that year, came thither with petitions from their\r\nconstituents, praying to be exempt from the payment of taxes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 272:\r\n\r\n  “Coinage is peculiarly an attribute of sovereignty: to transfer its\r\n  exercise into another country, is to submit it to another sovereign.”\r\n  See a Report made to congress, in the year 1790, by Thomas Jefferson,\r\n  Esq. then secretary of state, on certain Proposals for supplying the\r\n  United States with Copper Coinage, offered by Mr. John H. Mitchell, a\r\n  foreign artist.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut while this assembly were in session, a letter was received from\r\nGeneral Washington by the Supreme Executive Council of the state, and by\r\nthem confidentially communicated to the legislative body, in which the\r\ndistressed condition of the army was faithfully described. Among other\r\nthings the General stated, that, notwithstanding his confidence in the\r\nattachment of the army to the cause of their country, the distresses of\r\nthe soldiery, arising from a destitution of those necessaries which were\r\nindispensable, had become extreme; insomuch, that appearances of mutiny\r\nwere so strongly marked on the countenances of the army, as to occasion\r\nin his mind hourly apprehensions of the event.\r\n\r\nThis appalling information, and from such a source, elicited some\r\nlatent sparks of public spirit. Voluntary contributions were\r\nimmediately begun; and Robert Morris, Esq. a merchant of the highest\r\ncredit—as well as a man whose patriotism, talents and enterprize,\r\ninspired confidence—contributed two hundred pounds, Pennsylvania\r\ncurrency, in (what was then called) _hard money_. This subscription\r\ncommenced the 8th of June, 1780: but it amounted, in the whole to only\r\n200_l._ hard money, and 101,360_l._ in the public bills of credit, or\r\npaper-money, denominated _continental_.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of the same month, however, a meeting of the contributors to\r\nthis fund (which was intended as a donation, towards carrying on the\r\nrecruiting service,) and of others, was convened in Philadelphia: with a\r\nview to promote the object more extensively. At this meeting it was\r\nresolved—“to open a security-subscription, to the amount of 300,000_l._\r\nin real money; the subscribers to execute bonds to the amount of their\r\nsubscription, and to form a Bank thereon, for supplying the army.”\r\n\r\nThis was the origin of the “Bank of North-America,” which thus took its\r\nrise from an association of “a number of patriotic persons” in the city\r\nof Philadelphia. The plan they formed for the purpose was communicated\r\nto congress by the secretary at war, on the 20th of June; and the next\r\nday they were honoured with a vote of thanks.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February, 1781, Mr. Morris was unanimously elected by\r\ncongress to the office of Superintendant of Finance, then first created.\r\nThis gentleman arranged, in the spring following[273], the system of the\r\npresent Bank of North-America; whereupon, many of the subscribers to the\r\nfirst-formed bank transferred their subscriptions to this institution.\r\nThese were incorporated by an ordinance of congress[274], passed the\r\n31st of December, 1781; and in the beginning of the succeeding year,\r\nthis Bank commenced its operations in Philadelphia. By the incorporating\r\nordinance, the following gentlemen were nominated by congress to be the\r\npresident and directors of the institution, until a choice of a new\r\ndirection should be made by the stockholders; namely, Thomas Willing,\r\nThomas Fitzsimons, John Maxwell Nesbitt, James Wilson, Henry Hill,\r\nSamuel Osgood, Cadwalader Morris, Andrew Caldwell, Samuel Inglis, Samuel\r\nMeredith, William Bingham, and Timothy Matlack, Esquires. Mr. Willing, a\r\nmerchant of high credit and respectability, was president of the board.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 273:\r\n\r\n  The plan of the Bank of North-America, which was submitted to congress\r\n  by their order, was approved by them on the 26th of May, 1781.\r\n\r\nFootnote 274:\r\n\r\n  When the question, respecting the incorporation of the Bank of\r\n  North-America was taken in congress, twenty members voted in the\r\n  affirmative and only four in the negative. But the votes were then\r\n  taken by states; and of these, the delegates from New-York and\r\n  Delaware were absent, Pennsylvania (having only two members of her\r\n  delegation present) was divided, Massachusetts (having also but two\r\n  members present) voted in the negative: all the southern states were\r\n  in the affirmative, with the single exception of Mr. Madison’s vote,\r\n  his three colleagues (from Virginia) being on the affirmative side of\r\n  the question.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSome doubts having arisen, respecting the right of congress, under the\r\nthen existing confederation, to exercise the power of erecting any\r\ncorporate body, an act was passed by the general assembly of\r\nPennsylvania, the 1st of April, 1782, to incorporate this Bank, in order\r\nto obviate such doubts. That act was repealed, the 13th of September,\r\n1785; but on the 18th of March, 1787, the charter was renewed for the\r\nterm of fourteen years, and has been since further continued.\r\n\r\nIt was by means of this establishment, that Mr. Morris, the\r\nsuperintendant of the finances, was enabled to support the public\r\ncredit, and, in the words of Dr. Gordon, “to keep things in motion,” at\r\na most critical period of the American affairs, and when the national\r\ncredit was in the lowest possible state of depression.[275]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  Whatever failings (and these were of a venial nature) may have\r\n  appeared in the transactions of Mr. Morris, as a private citizen, in\r\n  the latter part of a life long devoted to honourable and useful\r\n  pursuits, yet the eminent services which he rendered to his country,\r\n  in times of her greatest peril, entitled him to the gratitude of his\r\n  compatriots; for, in his numerous and important official and other\r\n  public negotiations, his honour and integrity were alike\r\n  irreproachable. His merits ought not only to rescue his name from\r\n  oblivion, but they give him a just claim to be placed in the list of\r\n  American worthies; while his subsequent misfortunes —— —— —— —— ——\r\n  but,\r\n\r\n               “No further seek his merits to disclose,\r\n               Or draw his frailties from his dread abode,\r\n               (There they alike in trembling hope repose,)\r\n               The bosom of his Father and his God.”\r\n                                                    _Gray._\r\n\r\n  Mr. Morris, who was long distinguished for his talents and his\r\n  services in this country, was a native of Lancashire, in England. He\r\n  died in Philadelphia on the 8th of May, 1806.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a Mint seems to be a necessary appendage to that of\r\na national Bank. Accordingly, Mr. Morris, in his capacity of\r\nsuperintendant of the finances, addressed a letter to congress, on the\r\n15th of January 1782, “touching the establishment of a Mint.” On the\r\n21st of the succeeding month, they approved his proposal,—directing him,\r\nat the same time, “to prepare and report to congress a plan:” But\r\nnothing further appears to have been done in this business, until the\r\n16th of October 1786, when congress passed “An Ordinance for the\r\nestablishment of the Mint of the United States,” &c.\r\n\r\nAbout two years, however, after the commencement of the present federal\r\ngovernment (viz. March 3. 1791,) a resolution of congress was passed,\r\nconcerning the establishing of a Mint, under such regulations as should\r\nbe directed by law. Previously to this, the late Alexander Hamilton,\r\nEsq. had communicated to the house of representatives, by their order,\r\nthe result of his enquiries and reflexions on the subject, in a diffuse\r\nand masterly official report. In his report, this able financier, alike\r\ndistinguished as a statesman and a soldier,[276] remarked, that “the\r\nunequal values allowed in different parts of the Union to coins of the\r\nsame intrinsic worth; the defective species of them, which embarrass the\r\ncirculation of them in some of the states; and the dissimilarity in\r\ntheir several monies of account, are inconveniences, which if not to be\r\nascribed to the want of a national coinage, will at least be most\r\neffectually remedied by the establishment of one; a measure that will at\r\nthe same time give additional security against impositions, by\r\ncounterfeit as well as by base currencies.”—“It was with great reason,\r\ntherefore,” continues the Secretary, “that the attention of congress,\r\nunder the late confederation, was repeatedly drawn to the establishment\r\nof a Mint; and it is with equal reason that the subject has been\r\nresumed; now that the favourable change which has taken place in the\r\nsituation of public affairs, admits of its being carried into\r\nexecution.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 276:\r\n\r\n  “The task of re-creating public credit,” (says Chief Justice Marshal,\r\n  in his _Life of Washington_,) “of drawing order and arrangement from\r\n  the chaotic confusion in which the finances of America were involved,\r\n  and of devising means which should render the revenue productive, and\r\n  commensurate with the demand, was justly classed among the most\r\n  arduous of the duties which devolved on the new government[276a]. In\r\n  discharging it, much aid was expected from the head of the treasury.\r\n  To Colonel Hamilton[276b] was assigned this important, and at that\r\n  time intricate department.\r\n\r\n  “This gentleman was a native of the island of St. Croix, and, at a\r\n  very early period of life, had been placed by his friends in New-York.\r\n  Possessing an ardent temper, he caught fire from the concussions of\r\n  the moment, and with all the enthusiasm of youth, engaged first his\r\n  pen, and afterwards his sword, in the stern contest between the\r\n  American colenies and their parent state. Among the first troops\r\n  raised by New-York was a corps of artillery, in which he was appointed\r\n  a captain. Soon after the war was transferred to the Hudson, his\r\n  superior endowments recommended him to the attention of the commander\r\n  in chief, into whose family, before completing his twenty-first year,\r\n  he was invited to enter. Equally brave and intelligent, he continued\r\n  in this situation to display a degree of firmness and capacity which\r\n  commanded the confidence and esteem of his general, and of the\r\n  principal officers in the army.\r\n\r\n  “After the capitulation at York-Town, the war languished throughout\r\n  the American continent, and the probability that its termination was\r\n  approaching daily increased.\r\n\r\n  “The critical circumstances of the existing government rendered the\r\n  events of the civil, more interesting than those of the military\r\n  department, and Colonel Hamilton accepted a seat in the congress of\r\n  the United States. In all the important acts of the day, he performed\r\n  a conspicuous part, and was greatly distinguished among those\r\n  distinguished characters whom the crisis had attracted to the councils\r\n  of their country. He had afterwards been active in promoting those\r\n  measures which led to the convention at Philadelphia, of which he was\r\n  a member, and had greatly contributed to the adoption of the\r\n  constitution by the state of New-York. In the distinguished part he\r\n  had performed, both in the military and civil transactions of his\r\n  country, he had acquired a great degree of well merited fame; and the\r\n  frankness of his manners, the openness of his temper, the warmth of\r\n  his feelings, and the sincerity of his heart, had secured him many\r\n  valuable friends.\r\n\r\n  “To talents of the highest grade, he united a patient industry, not\r\n  always the companion of genius, which fitted him in a peculiar manner\r\n  for the difficulties to be encountered by the man who should be placed\r\n  at the head of the American finances.”\r\n\r\n  The disastrous death of this celebrated man happened on the 12th day\r\n  of July, 1804, at the age of about forty-seven years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 276a:\r\n\r\n  This was in the year 1789.\r\n\r\nFootnote 276b:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards promoted to the rank of Major-General.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Mint has been continued in Philadelphia, ever since its\r\nestablishment,—a great commercial city being very properly considered\r\nthe most suitable situation for such an institution; its operations have\r\nbeen conducted, for many years past, with activity; and there are few\r\ncoins superior in beauty, to those of the American Mint.\r\n\r\nIn less than a year after Dr. Rittenhouse had engaged himself in the\r\nduties appertaining to the Directorship of the Mint, he was again called\r\nupon to assist his countrymen, by the aid of his talents, in effecting\r\nan important water-communication, inland, which was then contemplated.\r\nAn association, called “The Conewago-Canal Company,” was formed in\r\nPhiladelphia, in pursuance of a law enacted the 13th of April, 1791; by\r\nwhich the sum of fourteen thousand dollars was appropriated, for the\r\npurpose of improving the navigation of the river Susquehanna, between\r\nWright’s Ferry (now the thriving town of Columbia) and the mouth of the\r\nSwatara. This company consisted of seventeen members, of whom Dr.\r\nRittenhouse was one: and they were incorporated by an act of assembly,\r\npassed the 10th of April, 1793.\r\n\r\nJust about this period, an occurrence took place at Philadelphia, then\r\nthe seat of the national government, which excited much public feeling\r\nat the time, and—contrary to the expectations of some good men of\r\nsanguine dispositions—became the source of many political evils,\r\nafterwards. This was the formation of what was called the Democratic\r\nSociety; a political association, produced by the effervescences of the\r\nFrench revolution, while that all-important event was yet viewed in a\r\nfavourable light by free nations: and of this society, Dr. Rittenhouse\r\nwas elected President.\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Rittenhouse should have been selected as the President of the\r\nDemocratic Society, and chosen for that station, can be readily\r\naccounted for. This gentleman had evinced, from the commencement of the\r\ntroubles between the American colonies of Great-Britain and the parent\r\ncountry, an ardent attachment to the cause of his native land. The\r\nbenevolence of his disposition rendered him the well-wisher of all\r\nmankind: hence every thing that, in his view, bore the semblance of\r\noppression, was odious to him. But the wrongs which the country of his\r\nnativity, more particularly, experienced, from the unconstitutional\r\nclaims of the British Parliament, roused those feelings of patriotism,\r\nwith which his virtuous breast was animated, at the beginning of the\r\nAmerican discontents: he was, therefore, an early and decided Whig; and\r\nthe same principles that induced him to become such, continued to\r\nactuate him throughout the contest between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe benignity of his temper must, nevertheless, have induced him to be\r\ntruly rejoiced at the return of peace. When that happy event took place,\r\nhe had too much goodness of heart to remember past injuries, too much\r\nunderstanding to be influenced by unworthy and mischievous prejudices;\r\nhe had not a particle of malignity in his nature. At the period of the\r\nDeclaration of American Independence by Congress, he believed, with a\r\ngreat majority of his countrymen, that necessity justified the\r\nseparation: and from that epocha, he was heartily disposed to hold the\r\nmother-country, as his compatriots then declared they did the rest of\r\nmankind,—“enemies in war, in peace friends.”\r\n\r\nWhen the French revolution commenced, the benevolence of his feelings\r\nled him to believe, as almost every American then did, that it would\r\nmeliorate the condition of a great nation, whose inhabitants constituted\r\na large portion of the population of the European world;—a nation,\r\nwhich, by the rigourous policy of its government, under a long\r\nsuccession of ambitious and arbitrary monarchs, anterior to the one then\r\non the tottering throne of that ill-fated country, had become extremely\r\ncorrupt among the higher orders of the people; and in which, the\r\ninferior classes were subjected to great oppression. The American people\r\nhaving, on their separation from the mother-country, instituted for\r\nthemselves, as an independent nation, a constitution wholly republican;\r\nthey were disposed to attribute the vices of the French government,\r\nbefore the revolution, to the circumstance of its being a monarchy, and\r\nthe sufferings of the people of France, as necessarily resulting from\r\nthe monarchial system of rule over them. When, therefore, a republican\r\nform of government was erected in France on the ruins of the throne; the\r\nexcesses, and even the atrocities of the people, which attended the\r\ndemolition of the ancient government of that country, and the\r\nestablishment of political institutions entirely new to its inhabitants,\r\nfound palliatives in the dispositions of most good men among us: they\r\nwere ascribed to the strong conflicting passions naturally produced\r\nbetween the great body of the people, on the one part, and their rulers\r\non the other; excited by the long sufferings of the former, and an\r\nunwillingness to part with power, in the latter. Great enormities were\r\nconsidered as the inevitable consequences of these opposite interests,\r\nwhen brought into action amidst a population of many millions of men,\r\nwhose national characteristic is that of levity of temper and vehement\r\npassions; and a conflict, wherein all the malign dispositions of the\r\nmost depraved characters, actuated by motives the most flagitious,\r\nintermingled themselves with the designs of those who meant well. Such\r\nmen, freed from all the restraints of government and law, and utterly\r\ndisregarding all the obligations of either religious or moral duties,\r\nhad then an opportunity of giving a full vent to their views, whether of\r\nambition, avarice or personal resentments; and they did not fail to\r\nembrace it. While, on the one hand, demagogues fanned the popular flame\r\nby the vilest artifices; put on the semblance of patriotism, and by\r\npractising the most detestable hypocrisy, professed themselves to be the\r\nfriends of the people, whom they were deluding into premeditated ruin.\r\nEven virtuous Frenchmen, and many of them possessing no inconsiderable\r\nshare of discernment, soon fell victims to the machiavelian policy of\r\nthese pretended patriots. These, in their turn, were sacrificed under\r\nthe denunciations of their compeers, or other aspiring villains; and\r\nthus, others still in succession: until, finally, a fortunate military\r\nusurper, restored the monarchy in his own person, with absolute sway;\r\nand by substituting an horrible military despotism, in the place of a\r\nmost sanguinary anarchy, confounded all ranks of his subjects in one\r\nvast mass of miserable slaves; who have been since employed in\r\ndestroying the peace, freedom and happiness of their fellow-men, in\r\nother countries. Such have been, hitherto, the fruits of the French\r\nrevolution; from which, at its commencement, myriads of good men fondly\r\nanticipated an issue precisely the reverse.[277]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 277:\r\n\r\n  The deleterious, though—as it might almost be called—fascinating\r\n  influence, of the revolution undertaken by the people of France,\r\n  extended itself far and wide, prior to the murder of their king, even\r\n  in countries under the milder forms of government: many characters of\r\n  great worth were every where misled by the plausibility of the avowed\r\n  designs of its authors and supporters; and in no country was the\r\n  infatuation more general, than in the United States. In England\r\n  itself, it begat a kind of political frenzy; and, had not the wise and\r\n  salutary writings of the celebrated Burke arrested its progress, in\r\n  good time, the most fatal consequences must have ensued. Among the\r\n  literary and scientific men in Britain, who became deeply infected by\r\n  the revolution-mania of that day, was Dr. Erasmus Darwin, Miss Anna\r\n  Seward (one of his biographers) remarks, that the Doctor has\r\n  introduced into his _Botanic Garden_ an allegory, representing\r\n  _Liberty_ “as a great form, slumbering within the iron cage and marble\r\n  walls of the French Bastile, unconscious of his chains; till, touched\r\n  by the patriot flame, he rends his flimsy bonds, lifts his colossal\r\n  form, and rears his hundred arms over his foes; calls to the good and\r\n  brave of every country, with a voice that echoes like the thunder of\r\n  heaven to the polar extremities;\r\n\r\n             “Gives to the winds his banner broad, unfurl’d,\r\n             “And gathers in its shade the living world!”\r\n\r\n  In consequence of Darwin’s use of this grossly misapplied figure;—as\r\n  the issue of the French revolution too fatally proves it to have\r\n  been,—Miss Seward offers the following apology for the subject of her\r\n  friendly pen:\r\n\r\n  “This sublime sally of a too-confiding imagination, has made the poet\r\n  and his work countless foes. They triumphed over him,” says his fair\r\n  biographer, “on a result so contrary,—on the mortal wounds given by\r\n  French crimes to real Liberty. They forget, or choose to forget, that\r\n  this part of the poem (though published after the other) appeared in\r\n  1791, antecedent to the dire regicide, and to all those unprecedented\r\n  scenes of sanguinary cruelty inflicted on France, by three of her\r\n  republican tyrants; compared to whom, the most remorseless of her\r\n  monarchs was mild and merciful.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the criminal excesses committed by many of the French\r\nrevolutionists, before the institution of their short lived and\r\nturbulent republic, it was hoped by most true Americans, attached by\r\nfidelity as well as principle to that system of government, which was\r\nthen the legitimate one in their own country, that its ultimate\r\nestablishment in France would produce permanent benefits, to that\r\ncountry at least, which would infinitely overbalance what were\r\nconsidered, by zealous republicans, as temporary and partial evils, such\r\nas seemed to be unavoidable, in bringing about a radical change in the\r\nfundamental institutions of a great and powerful empire. Many Americans\r\nwere not, indeed, so sanguine in their expectations: but such were,\r\nnevertheless, the prevailing sentiments of the citizens of the United\r\nStates,—even among the best-informed men.\r\n\r\nThe deliberative and cautionary proceedings (as they purported to be) of\r\nthe more prominent revolutionary characters in France, in their minor\r\npopular assemblies, prior to the establishment of their national\r\nconstitutional form of government, were judged of, in the United States,\r\nwith respect to their objects and utility, as similar assemblies, under\r\nthe denominations of councils of safety, committees of safety, &c. were\r\nconsidered by their own citizens, at the commencement of the American\r\nrevolution: they were deemed to be necessary agents of the people in\r\neach country, respectively, during the interregnum which succeeded the\r\nabandonment of their ancient governments.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobin Club of Paris was one of these political engines of the\r\nFrench revolution, for some time after its commencement; and, perhaps,\r\nthat assembly contained many worthy members, originally, although it\r\nafterwards became notoriously infamous, by the monstrous enormity of the\r\ncrimes it countenanced and produced.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Marshall has observed (in his _Life of Washington_,) that\r\n“soon after the arrival of Mr. Genet,[278] a Democratic Society was\r\nformed in Philadelphia, which seems to have taken for its model the\r\nJacobin Club of Paris:”—“Its organization,” continues the historian,\r\n“appears to have been completed on the 30th of May, 1793.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 278:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Genet arrived in Philadelphia the 16th of May, 1793; and in the\r\n  evening of the same day a meeting of the citizens was held at the\r\n  state-house, when a committee was appointed to draw up an address to\r\n  this minister from the republic of France: Mr. Rittenhouse was the\r\n  first named on that committee. At a meeting of the citizens held the\r\n  next day, he, as chairman of that committee, reported an address\r\n  accordingly; which, being adopted by the persons then assembled, was\r\n  presented to the new minister, the ensuing morning.\r\n\r\n  The president’s proclamation of neutrality had then been issued\r\n  between three and four weeks:[278a] the addressers therefore say,\r\n  keeping this in their view; “Earnestly giving to the national\r\n  exertions (of France) our wishes and our prayers, we cannot resist the\r\n  pleasing hope, that although America is not a party in the existing\r\n  war, she may still be able, in a state of peace, to demonstrate the\r\n  sincerity of her friendship, by affording very useful assistance to\r\n  her sister republic.”—The “useful assistance,” here alluded to, and\r\n  which it was supposed France might derive from this country, “in a\r\n  state of peace,” did not contemplate any infringement of the\r\n  neutrality of the United States: Nor could Mr. Genet, himself,\r\n  consider the language of the address in any other than its true sense;\r\n  for, in his extempore answer, (a written one was also returned,) he\r\n  says, “From the remote situation of America, and other circumstances,\r\n  France does not expect that America should become a party in the war;\r\n  but remembering that she has already combated for your liberties, (and\r\n  if it was necessary, and she had the power, would cheerfully again\r\n  enlist in your cause,) we hope, (and every thing I hear and see\r\n  assures me our hope will be realized,) that her citizens will be\r\n  treated as brothers, in danger and distress.” This declaration of the\r\n  French minister, made immediately after his arrival at the seat of the\r\n  American government, forbad the addressers to believe, that either he\r\n  or any other agent of the French government would afterwards undertake\r\n  to violate the neutrality of the United States.\r\n\r\nFootnote 278a:\r\n\r\n  It is dated the 22d of April, 1793.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt will nevertheless be recollected, that, about that period, the shock\r\ngiven to the humane feelings of the American people, by the murder of\r\nLouis XVI. their benefactor during the war in this country, and by the\r\ndeath and sufferings of his queen and family, had mostly subsided. The\r\ngreat American public still continued warmly and sincerely attached to\r\nwhat was then viewed as the cause of the French people: and therefore,\r\nwhatever may have been the real design of setting up a Democratic\r\nSociety in Philadelphia, at that point of time—a design only known to\r\nits founders,—it is certain, that many highly estimable and meritorious\r\ncitizens, and firm friends of the existing government, were elected\r\nmembers of that society, without any previous intimation being given to\r\nthem of such an intention: some of those persons never attended any of\r\nthe meetings of the society; and others soon discontinued their\r\nattendance. If it were actually formed on the model of the Jacobin Club\r\nof Paris, by some of those with whom the scheme originated, it cannot be\r\nrationally presumed that men of great purity of reputation, in public as\r\nwell as private life, would either seek admission into such an assembly,\r\nknowing it had any criminal views; nor would they, if chosen members of\r\nit without their knowledge and consent, participate in its proceedings,\r\nshould these be found to be unconstitutional, illegal, or dishonourable.\r\nYet it is a matter of notoriety, that persons of such characters were in\r\nsome instances enrolled among the members of the Democratic Society in\r\nPhiladelphia, at its commencement and soon after its organization, in\r\nthe spring of 1793.\r\n\r\nIt may be readily supposed, that such of its members as meant well,\r\nwould be desirous of placing at the head of that body, a man of\r\nunimpeachable patriotism and integrity; and it is equally reasonable to\r\nconclude, that, had there been a majority of its members, whose secret\r\ndesigns were inimical to the true interest of the country or the\r\nwell-being of the government,—even these would wish to disguise their\r\nintentions, under the nominal auspices of a character universally\r\nrespected and esteemed. Such a man was Dr. Rittenhouse; and therefore\r\nwas he selected by the Philadelphia Democratic Society, as their\r\nPresident. At the time of his election to that station, he held the\r\nhighly important office of Director of the Mint, under a commission from\r\nPresident Washington; for whose public and private character he always\r\nentertained the most exalted respect, besides the personal regard, which\r\nthe writer of these Memoirs knows to have subsisted between them. It is\r\nnot presumable, taking all considerations into view, that Dr.\r\nRittenhouse suffered any serious diminution in the esteem of that\r\nvirtuous and discerning statesman, by the circumstance of the Doctor\r\nbeing placed at the head of the Democratic Society: for he not only\r\ncontinued to hold the Directorship of the Mint, but, when he offered his\r\nresignation of that high trust, two years afterwards, the President’s\r\nreluctance to accept it yielded only to the Doctor’s urgent solicitation\r\nto decline a further continuance in the office.\r\n\r\nWhatever, therefore, may have been the real views and intentions of some\r\nof the members of the Democratic Society which was formed in\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1793,—even if those of a majority of their number were\r\nhighly unjustifiable,—no imputation, unfavourable to Dr. Rittenhouse’s\r\ncharacter, either as a good citizen or an upright man, could in the\r\nsmallest degree be attached to him, by reason of his having been chosen\r\na President of that body, at the time of its organization.[279]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 279:\r\n\r\n  Many months after the death of Dr. Rittenhouse, the same licentious\r\n  writer who publicly charged him with being an Atheist, declared, in\r\n  the same public manner, what was equally untrue. He asserted, not only\r\n  that Mr. Rittenhouse “volunteered as president of the Democratic\r\n  Society, in Philadelphia,” but that “he himself signed the\r\n  inflammatory resolves against the excise-law, which encouraged the\r\n  malecontents to rise in open rebellion.” The fact is, that the\r\n  “inflammatory resolves” referred to, were entered into by that body,\r\n  on the 8th of May, 1794; and were not signed by Mr. Rittenhouse, but\r\n  by another person, as “President pro tem.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Rittenhouse was a zealous advocate for the liberties of\r\nmankind, is unquestionable: but, much as he abhorred slavery and\r\noppression of every kind, did he deprecate turbulence and licentiousness\r\nin the people, and wars of ambition, avarice or injustice, undertaken by\r\ntheir rulers. He was decidedly friendly to those measures of civil\r\ngovernment, which are best calculated to maintain order, tranquillity,\r\nand safety in the state, on just and honourable principles. It can\r\nscarcely be doubted by any one, intimately acquainted with his\r\ncharacter, that he must have concurred in sentiments similar to those\r\nattributed by the biographer of Washington to that great man, or this\r\nsubject,—in the following observation: “Between a balanced republic and\r\na democracy the difference is like that between order and chaos. Real\r\nliberty, he thought, was to be secured only by preserving the authority\r\nof the laws, and maintaining the energy of government. Scarcely did\r\nsociety present two characters which, in his opinion, less resembled\r\neach other, than a patriot and a demagogue.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse, it must be rationally supposed, was less acquainted\r\nwith mankind, than General Washington was known to be: he had much fewer\r\nand more limited opportunities of studying human nature; and professions\r\nof pretended patriots were, therefore, more likely to impose on the\r\nunsuspecting honesty of his nature. He may even have been deceived, for\r\na while, and ere the plausible fallacies of theorists in matters of\r\ncivil polity, emanating from the philosophy of the French school, had\r\nyet been manifested to the world. A practical philosopher himself, he\r\nmust have contemplated with pity, if not with indignation, the doctrines\r\nof the followers of Pyrrho: with whom it was a fundamental principle,\r\nthat there is nothing that can be denominated true or false, right or\r\nwrong, honest or dishonest, just or unjust; or, in other words, that\r\nthere is no standard beyond law or custom; and that uncertainty and\r\ndoubt are attached to all things. Nevertheless, on these doctrines of\r\nthe sceptical philosophers of antiquity are founded that monstrous and\r\nwicked tenet of most of the modern sceptics, that _the end justifies the\r\nmeans_!—a principle destructive of all the foundations of religion and\r\nmorals. Well might the Abbé le Blanc exclaim, when noticing this\r\nmischievous sect of philosophers, seventy years ago,—“Is it not\r\nsurprising, that men should endeavour to acquire the esteem of the\r\npublic, by striving to break the most sacred band of all societies; in\r\ndeclaring their opinion to others, that there is neither virtue nor\r\nvice, truth nor doubt.”—“Our modern philosophers,”[280] says the learned\r\nAbbé in another place, “have been _too confident_.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 280:\r\n\r\n  The Abbé le Blanc (or the writer who assumed that appellation) names,\r\n  of this metaphysical tribe, Hobbes, Lord Shaftesbury, Tindal and\r\n  Collins, all Englishmen; though his own country has long been the\r\n  superlatively prolific soil of infidelity in religion, and chimerical\r\n  theories in every department of science: such philosophers abound in\r\n  France. He observes very justly, however, that “there is nothing so\r\n  improperly made use of, as the name philosopher.” See _Le Blanc’s\r\n  Letters on the English and French Nations_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is certainly correct, in one point of view; although the assertion\r\nseems to imply a contradiction in terms, so far as it applies to the\r\nmetaphysical scepticism of many, assuming the honourable appellation of\r\nPhilosophers, without being entitled to the true character. What were\r\nthe sentiments of Dr. Rittenhouse, concerning the tenets of men of this\r\ndescription, may be fairly inferred, not only from the manner in which\r\nhe has introduced the names of Berkeley and Hume into the Oration which\r\nhe pronounced before the Philosophical Society, in the year 1775, but\r\nfrom other observations and reflexions contained in that discourse, as\r\nwell as from the general tenure of opinions expressed by him on various\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nAt an early period of the French revolution, a circumstance occurred,\r\nwhich, from its connexion in some particulars with the life of our\r\nPhilosopher, is here entitled to notice.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August 1783, and after peace had been proclaimed, congress\r\nunanimously passed a resolution in the following words——“Resolved, That\r\nan equestrian statue of General Washington be erected at the place where\r\nthe residence of Congress shall be established;—that the statue be of\r\nbronze: the General to be represented in a Roman dress, holding a\r\ntruncheon in his right hand, and his head, encircled with a laurel\r\nwreath. The Statue to be supported by a marble pedestal, on which are to\r\nbe represented, in _basso relievo_, the following principal events of\r\nthe war, in which General Washington commanded in person: the evacuation\r\nof Boston;—the capture of the Hessions, at Trenton;—the battle of\r\nPrinceton;—the action of Monmouth;—and the surrender of York.—On the\r\nupper part of the front of the pedestal, to be engraved as follows: “The\r\nUnited States in Congress assembled ordered this Statue to be erected,\r\nin the year of our Lord 1783, in honour of GEORGE WASHINGTON, the\r\nillustrious Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States of\r\nAmerica, during the war which vindicated and secured their Liberty,\r\nSovereignty and Independence.”[281]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 281:\r\n\r\n  The legislature of Virginia, in their first session after the\r\n  resignation of the Commander in Chief, passed the following\r\n  resolution:—\r\n\r\n  “Resolved, that the executive be requested to take measures for\r\n  procuring a Statue of General Washington, to be of the finest marble\r\n  and best workmanship, with the following inscription on its pedestal.\r\n\r\n  “The general assembly of the commonwealth of Virginia have caused this\r\n  statue to be erected as a monument of affection and gratitude to\r\n  GEORGE WASHINGTON, who, uniting to the endowments of the HERO, the\r\n  virtues of the PATRIOT, and exerting both in establishing the\r\n  Liberties of his Country, has rendered his name dear to his\r\n  fellow-citizens, and given the world an immortal example of true\r\n  glory.”\r\n\r\n  This resolution was afterwards carried into effect: the statue which\r\n  it decreed was executed by Houdon, and occupies a conspicuous place,\r\n  in a spacious area in the centre of the capital at Richmond, in\r\n  Virginia.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis was an honourable testimony of the gratitude and affectionate\r\nrespect of the nation, towards the Hero and Patriot, who so eminently\r\nmerited both; and it was a sincere effusion of the heart, in the\r\nrepresentatives of the American people, while the transcendent virtues\r\nof a WASHINGTON, and his then recent services in his country’s cause,\r\nyet inspired every generous breast with a faithful remembrance of his\r\nworth: It was a laudable proof of the patriotism that actuated the\r\npublic mind, at a period, when, in the words of an enlightened\r\nhistorian,[282] “the glow of expression in which the high sense\r\nuniversally entertained of his services was conveyed, manifested a\r\nwarmth of feeling seldom equalled in the history of man.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  Chief-Justice Marshall, in his _Life of George Washington_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe fascination which the revolution of France spread over a large\r\nportion of Europe and America, for some time after its commencement, and\r\nduring the time it yet bore the semblance of a virtuous cause,—while it\r\nseemed to enchant the true friends of freedom every where; and the\r\noft-resounded and captivating _name_ of “Liberty,” produced in men of\r\nardent tempers, and speculative notions, ideas of its _reality_ of the\r\nmost extravagant nature, and in numerous instances of very mischievous\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\nAmong those of the latter description was Joseph Ceracchi, an Italian\r\nartist of celebrity. Mr. Ceracchi was a statuary, of great eminence in\r\nhis profession; and to the manners and accomplishments of a gentleman,\r\nhe united much genius and taste. Though born and bred in the dominions\r\nof the papal see, he fostered the principles of a republican. Conceiving\r\nthat the genius of a free government comported with these alone, he\r\nbecame an enthusiastic admirer of the French _republic_. Finding the\r\nturbulent state of France, at the beginning of her troubles,\r\nunfavourable to the exercise of his art, in that country; and believing\r\nas he did, that the tranquil and prosperous condition of the United\r\nStates would afford full employment for his talents, in a manner\r\ncongenial to his inclinations, as well as beneficial to his private\r\ninterest; he arrived, with his wife—a German lady of some distinction—at\r\nPhiladelphia, then the seat of the national government, sometime (it is\r\nsupposed) in the year 1793.\r\n\r\nThe great equestrian statue, which congress had, ten years before,\r\ndecreed to be erected in honour of General Washington, had not yet been\r\nexecuted; and Mr. Ceracchi imagined that the gratitude of the American\r\nrepublic would furnish, besides this primary work, ample scope for the\r\nexercise of his talents, in erecting honorary memorials of some of the\r\nmore illustrious characters, which the American revolution had produced.\r\nThe aptitude, beauty and magnificence, which the artist designed to\r\ndisplay in some great public monuments of this kind, were exhibited in\r\nmodels which he executed, for the purpose of testifying his abilities in\r\nthe art he professed: these were universally admired, as the productions\r\nof superior genius, taste and skill. Yet Mr. Ceracchi remained\r\nunemployed: the national council did not, even at that late day, avail\r\nthemselves of so favourable an opportunity of engaging him to erect the\r\nstatue _decreed_ to WASHINGTON,—a work which continues unexecuted at the\r\npresent moment[283]! and the talents of that eminent artist were, not\r\nlong afterwards, for ever lost to the country.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 283:\r\n\r\n  “If the example of all the republics that have preceded us did not\r\n  authorize the hope, that history will not find us guilty of\r\n  ingratitude, but only of delay, the national neglect of the memory of\r\n  Washington would be sufficient to repress every sentiment of\r\n  patriotism and public spirit. Of this neglect, aggravated by the\r\n  solemn steps taken by congress to obtain a right to remove the body of\r\n  the Founder of our Liberties to a place of public and honourable\r\n  sepulture, and the abandonment of that right when obtained, it is\r\n  painful to speak—nor is it necessary. There is not wanting a general\r\n  sentiment of the disgrace which the nation suffers, while the body of\r\n  Washington rests upon a trussle, crouded into a damp and narrow vault,\r\n  in which the rapid decay of the wooden support must in a few years\r\n  mingle his ashes with those of his worthy but unknown relations.\r\n  Exertions not altogether worthy of the object, but such as the present\r\n  fashion of finance authorizes, are made, to give to his memory that\r\n  honour in other cities, which is denied him in the metropolis of the\r\n  Union.” [See the _Ann. Oration delivered before the Society of\r\n  Artists, in Philadelphia, in May, 1811, by B. H. Latrobe, Esq._]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmong the gentlemen with whom Mr. Ceracchi became acquainted, in\r\nPhiladelphia, were some members of the Philosophical Society in that\r\ncity; and, on their recommendation of him, he was, himself, soon\r\nassociated with this institution.\r\n\r\nIn this body, as the Writer believes, Dr. Rittenhouse acquired a\r\nknowledge of Mr. Ceracchi’s person and character. Both Dr. and Mrs.\r\nRittenhouse, from their kind and unceasing attentions to this gentleman\r\nand his wife, appear to have considered them as persons of merit: the\r\nDoctor, particularly, by his friendly deportment towards the husband,\r\nduring the time he continued his residence in this country, testified\r\nthe esteem he had conceived for this ingenious foreigner; heightened\r\ntoo, perhaps, by a delicate sensibility towards him, on account of the\r\ndisappointment in his expectations of public patronage in his\r\nprofession, which he experienced while here. For it is known to the\r\nMemorialist, that when, in consequence of such disappointment, Mr.\r\nCeracchi became embarrassed in his pecuniary affairs, Dr. Rittenhouse\r\ncontributed liberally to his relief.\r\n\r\nSome time in the summer of the year 1794 (if the Writer’s recollection\r\nbe correct,) our benevolent philosopher having occasion to view the\r\ncanal, intended to form a communication between the waters of the\r\nDelaware and the Schuylkill, invited Mr. Ceracchi to accompany him, for\r\nthe purpose of examining the quality of the marble in the great quarries\r\nof that material, situated near the margin of the latter river, in the\r\nvicinity of the western end of the canal. The Memorialist joined in this\r\nlittle excursion, during which, Dr. Rittenhouse was, as usual,\r\ncommunicative, cheerful and instructive.\r\n\r\nOn inspecting the quarries just mentioned—so far as time then permitted\r\nan examination of them,—Mr. Ceracchi seemed to think they contained only\r\nlaminated strata of stone; not massy blocks, without fissures or veins,\r\nlike the marbles of Carrara, and those in some other parts of Europe:\r\nthat, although this Schuylkill marble was generally of a good quality\r\nand of a whiteness sufficiently pure, it could not be obtained in masses\r\nthick enough for the larger subjects of fine statuary. Yet this artist\r\nobserved, that a large proportion of the slabs appeared to be of\r\ndimensions suitable for various subjects of sculpture; and more\r\nespecially, that they furnished an excellent material for many purposes,\r\nornamental as well as useful, in public edifices and other\r\nstructures[284]. No other quarries of marble were viewed, on this\r\nexcursion: but it is probable Mr. Ceracchi would have found the marbles\r\nof Hitner’s and Henderson’s quarries—which are at nearly the same\r\ndistance from Philadelphia, though not situated very near the river\r\nSchuylkill—much better adapted in every respect, to the uses he\r\ncontemplated. This unfortunate man appeared to have possessed, in\r\naddition to genius and fine professional talents, the exalted virtue of\r\ngratitude. Dr. Rittenhouse was his benefactor; and the Philosophical\r\nSociety had elected him a member of their body: a fine bust of the\r\nPhilosopher in the antique style, was executed by Ceracchi in white\r\nmarble, and by him presented to the Society, on the 6th of February,\r\n1795. It is supposed that he left America about twelve months after this\r\ndate; and it is said, that he afterwards perished on a scaffold, in\r\nParis, in consequence of its being alleged, that he was engaged in a\r\nconspiracy against the life of Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  Mr. B. H. Latrobe, in speaking of the great improvement in\r\n  architecture recently manifested in Philadelphia, notices the peculiar\r\n  advantages derived to that city, from the valuable marbles in its\r\n  vicinity. “The beautiful marble,” says he, “with which this\r\n  neighbourhood abounds, and the excellence of all other building\r\n  materials, give to Philadelphia great advantages in this branch of the\r\n  fine arts.” (See Mr. Latrobe’s _Annual Oration_, delivered before the\r\n  _Society of Artists, in Philadelphia_, May 8th, 1811.) The correct\r\n  taste and superior skill of this gentleman, as an Architect and Civil\r\n  Engineer, are well known in the United States. In Philadelphia, _the\r\n  Bank of Pennsylvania_ will, more especially, remain a lasting monument\r\n  of his talents in architectural science, as well as of the excellent\r\n  quality of the marble (for such purposes) of which that edifice is\r\n  constructed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1794, the Earl of Buchan, P. S. S. A. and\r\nJames Anderson, LL. D. both distinguished characters in Scotland, were\r\nelected members of the American Philosophical Society, at Philadelphia:\r\nand it appears probable, from a note addressed to Dr. Rittenhouse by\r\nPresident Washington, that they had been put in nomination, or, at\r\nleast, that their election had been advocated by the former, at the\r\ninstance of the latter; the note is in these words—\r\n\r\n  “The President presents his compliments to Mr. Rittenhouse, and thanks\r\n  him for the attention he has given to the case of Mr. Anderson and the\r\n  Earl of Buchan.\r\n\r\n  “Sunday afternoon, 20th April, 1794.”\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the following year, Lord Buchan[285] wrote to Dr.\r\nRittenhouse the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                       “_Dryburgh Abbey, Jan. 12, 1795._\r\n\r\n  “Sir,\r\n\r\n  “My worthy friend, Mr. John Miller, son of the eminent professor, John\r\n  Miller, of Glasgow, whom I recommend to your attention, has charged\r\n  himself with this letter, and will deliver to you a Writing-Box, which\r\n  I dedicate to your use, as President of the Philosophical Society at\r\n  Philadelphia, and to your successors in office, as a testimony of my\r\n  high esteem for your literary character and for that of the Society\r\n  over which you preside.\r\n\r\n  “This Box is made of Yew, of Black Cherry tree, and Acacia and\r\n  Barberry, and veneered with Holly; all the growth of my garden at this\r\n  place, and joined, fitted and finished, by my own joiner, in this\r\n  house.\r\n\r\n  “On the lid is an authentic picture of Copernicus, and in the inside\r\n  thereof is a similar one of Napier. That of Copernicus is from the\r\n  accurate copy of the Chancellor Hupazzuoski’s original picture, which\r\n  was sent by the learned Dr. Wolf, of Dantzic, to the Royal Society of\r\n  London; and this limning of mine is most faithfully delineated and\r\n  shaded, from a drawing made by Mr. Thomas Parke, of Picadilly,\r\n  formerly a pupil of Valentine Green, engraver at London, from the\r\n  picture in the Royal Society, on a scale proportional in all parts and\r\n  with great fidelity; so that I can assure you of my limning being a\r\n  fac simile, as to the features and countenance. That of Napier[286] is\r\n  indeed a most exquisitely beautiful piece, by John Brown, of\r\n  Edinburgh, executed with the black-lead pencil, from an original\r\n  portrait in the possession of Lord Napier; and, as a drawing with\r\n  black-lead, excels, I believe, every thing of the kind now extant: Mr.\r\n  Brown having by drawing, during twelve years in Italy, from statues,\r\n  obtained a super-eminent accuracy and beauty of design.\r\n\r\n  “I consecrate this interesting piece of furniture to American Science,\r\n  and to the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia: willing, however,\r\n  that in consideration of the high esteem I bear to you personally, you\r\n  should have the custody and use of it in your own house, during your\r\n  life; producing it only to the Society for the use of the Secretary,\r\n  when you think proper. I have subjoined by way of postscript to this\r\n  letter, some particulars relating to the Residence of Copernicus, and\r\n  his Tomb; which I wish you to communicate to our Society.[287]\r\n\r\n  “Permit me to repeat my earnest request, that you should be kind and\r\n  attentive to the Bearer (and his Family,) who I hope will have the\r\n  happiness to obtain a literary establishment in the United States, and\r\n  prove of much utility to the public. I am, Sir, with esteem, your\r\n  obliged humble servant—\r\n\r\n                                                                BUCHAN.”\r\n\r\n  “DR. RITTENHOUSE, Pres. of the Am. Phil.

David Stewart Erskine, is the present Earl.\r\n\r\nFootnote 286:\r\n\r\n  John Napier, called Baron of Merchiston, in Scotland, was the eldest\r\n  son of Sir Archibald Napier, of Merchiston, and was born in the year\r\n  1550. As Lalande, in his _Astronomie_, observes—“he deserves to be\r\n  celebrated in a book on Astronomy, for his invention of Logarithms,\r\n  which he published in 1614. He had,” continues Mr. Lalande, “at first\r\n  concealed the principle of this discovery: but Kepler soon penetrated\r\n  it; and the son of Napier, in an edition of his father’s work, which\r\n  he published, explained the ground of the principles.”\r\n\r\n  The son here mentioned, Sir Archibald, was promoted to the peerage by\r\n  Car. I. in the year 1657, and was ancestor of the present Lord Napier.\r\n\r\n  An account of the Life and Writings of the Inventor of Logarithms was\r\n  published by the Earl of Buchan. W. B.\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  See this Postscript, in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis really “interesting piece of furniture” was viewed by Dr.\r\nRittenhouse and the Philosophical Society, in the light it was intended\r\nto be,—as a mark of the Donor’s good-will towards this institution, and\r\nof his respect for the character of its President. The Box has been\r\ndisposed of, agreeably to his Lordship’s desire: it is inserted in the\r\nlist of Donations to the Society, prefixed to the fourth volume of their\r\nTransactions, under the date of May 15, 1795, and it is, at present,\r\ndeposited in their Hall.\r\n\r\nThe friendship that subsisted between Dr. Rittenhouse and Mr. Jefferson,\r\nwas produced, in a great measure, by the congeniality of these gentlemen\r\nin the concerns of science. The correct and penetrating mind of the\r\nformer knew how to estimate at their just value, without over-rating\r\nthem, the literary and scientific acquirements of the latter; while, on\r\nthe other hand, this last was fully capable of discerning the sublime\r\ngenius and most extraordinary talents of that man whom he greatly\r\nadmired. While Mr. Jefferson resided in Philadelphia, as secretary of\r\nState, he made frequent visits to Dr. Rittenhouse: he thus became\r\nintimately acquainted with his character, for which he conceived the\r\nhighest respect; and, as a mark of his esteem for him, he presented him\r\nwith his own bust, in the costume of the day, cast in plaster, from one\r\nin marble executed by Houdon, of Paris.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson has testified to the world the exalted opinion he\r\nentertained of our Philosopher. In his refutation of the Count de\r\nBuffon’s preposterous theory, “of the tendency of nature to _belittle_\r\nher productions on this side the Atlantic,” he makes the following\r\nremarks, on the assertion of another French philosopher[288]—that\r\nAmerica has not produced “one able mathematician, one man of genius in a\r\nsingle art or a single science:”—“In war,” says Mr. Jefferson, “we have\r\nproduced a WASHINGTON, whose memory will be adored while liberty shall\r\nhave votaries, whose name will triumph over time, and will in future\r\nages assume its just station among the most celebrated worthies of the\r\nworld: when that wretched philosophy shall be forgotten, which would\r\nhave arranged him among the degeneracies of nature. In physics,“\r\ncontinues Mr. Jefferson, “we have produced a FRANKLIN, than whom no one\r\nof the present age has made more important discoveries, nor has enriched\r\nphilosophy with more, or more ingenious solutions of the phænomena of\r\nnature.—We have supposed Mr. RITTENHOUSE second to no astronomer living:\r\nthat in genius, he must be the first, because he is self-taught. As an\r\nartist he has exhibited as great a proof of mechanical genius, as the\r\nworld has ever produced. He has not indeed made a world; but he has by\r\nimitation approached nearer its Maker, than any man who has lived from\r\nthe creation to this day.”[289]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 288:\r\n\r\n  The Abbé Raynal. The Count de Buffon had conceived an opinion, which\r\n  he endeavoured to establish by ill-founded arguments, that the animals\r\n  common both to the Old and the New World, are smaller in the latter:\r\n  that those peculiar to the New World, are on a smaller scale: that\r\n  those which have been domesticated in both hemispheres, have\r\n  degenerated in America: and, that, on the whole, this portion of the\r\n  world exhibits fewer species. But Raynal went further: he has applied\r\n  this “new theory” (as Mr. Jefferson calls it) of the ingenious French\r\n  Naturist, to the race of men, descendants of Europeans, in America.\r\n  Mr. Jefferson has shewn the erroneousness of these theories, founded\r\n  on palpably mistaken facts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 289:\r\n\r\n  See Jefferson’s _Notes on Virginia_, written in the year 1781.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson retained the highest esteem for Dr. Rittenhouse, during\r\nhis life; and it is believed this sentiment was mutual. Letters of\r\nfriendship were occasionally interchanged by them: part of one of the\r\nlatest of these, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                           “_Monticello, Feb. 24, 1795._\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  ....[290]\r\n\r\n  “I am here immersed in the concerns of a farmer, and more interested\r\n  and engrossed by them, than I had ever conceived it possible. They in\r\n  a great degree render me indifferent to my books, so that I read\r\n  little and ride much; and I regret greatly the time I have suffered\r\n  myself to waste from home. To this, indeed, is added another kind of\r\n  regret, for the loss of society with the worthy characters with which\r\n  I became acquainted, in the course of my wanderings from home. If I\r\n  had but Fortunatus’s wishing cap, to seat myself sometimes by your\r\n  fireside, and to pay a visit to Dr. Priestly, I would be contented:\r\n  his writings evince, that he must be a fund of instruction, in\r\n  conversation, and his character an object of attachment and\r\n  veneration.\r\n\r\n  “Be so good as to present my best respects to Mrs. Rittenhouse; and to\r\n  accept, yourself, assurances of the high esteem of, dear sir, your\r\n  sincere friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                         “TH.

He now received numerous proofs of the\r\naffectionate respect and high consideration, in which his person and\r\ncharacter were held; both among his own countrymen and in foreign\r\nnations. Many of his fellow-citizens were assiduous in their\r\nattentions to him: they frequently visited him; and, when he was\r\nsuffering in his health, he experienced repeated acts of friendship\r\nand kindness:—President Washington often made calls upon him, and\r\nenquiries concerning his health; and among his other friends, the late\r\nMr. Henry Hill and Mr. Robert Morris manifested towards him the\r\nkindest attentions.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1795, our amiable Philosopher was admitted a\r\nmember of the Royal Society of London. He was apprized of this new mark\r\nof distinction conferred on him, by the following note, addressed to him\r\nby Phineas Bond, Esq. late the British Consul, resident in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n                                     “_Chesnut Street, 15th June, 1795._\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Bond has the honour to inform Mr. Rittenhouse, that he has\r\n  received a letter from his friend Mr. George Chalmers, of the office\r\n  of the Lords of the Committee of Council for Trade, &c. at White-hall,\r\n  in which he requests him to apprize Mr. R. of his election as a Fellow\r\n  of the Royal Society of London, which took place on the 23d of April.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. B. begs leave to congratulate Mr. R. on this new honour, to which\r\n  his merits, as a Philosopher, so eminently entitle him.\r\n\r\n                                               “DAVID RITTENHOUSE, ESQ.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until towards the close of the summer, that Dr. Rittenhouse\r\nreceived the certificate of his Fellowship, in the Royal Society. His\r\nDiploma, for this honour, bears date the 16th of April, 1795;[291] and\r\nwas accompanied by the following letter:\r\n\r\n  “Sir,\r\n\r\n  “Having the honour to transmit to you the Diploma of your election\r\n  into the Royal Society, as a foreign Member, I beg leave to\r\n  congratulate you on this proof of the high esteem in which you are\r\n  held by that illustrious body.

It has the signatures of eight of the Fellows of the\r\n  Society, besides those of the President and one of the\r\n  Vice-Presidents.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSoon after Dr. Rittenhouse became associated with that illustrious band\r\nof scientific men, a letter was written to him by Mr. Lalande, the\r\ncelebrated Astronomer of France; of which the following translation is\r\ngiven in this place, as it will be perused with interest by the reader\r\nversed in astronomy.\r\n\r\n                     “_Paris, at the College of France, May 14th, 1795._\r\n\r\n  “It is a long time, my dear Associate, since I have heard from you:\r\n  but Mr. Adet, our worthy ambassador, will probably procure for me that\r\n  satisfaction. You will see by the little history which I send you,\r\n  that the troubles of the revolution have not impaired my labours; and\r\n  that I have, now, twenty-seven thousand stars, observed.\r\n\r\n  “I have seen with great pleasure, in the transactions of your\r\n  Philosophical Society, the annular eclipse of 1791:[292] I have\r\n  calculated the conjunction 7^h 42′ 19″; but I have been obliged to\r\n  take one minute from the phases of the ring, and to suppose {6^h 49′\r\n  30″} / {6^h 53′ 47″}, in order to agree, either with your end of the\r\n  eclipse, or the difference of meridians, already known with sufficient\r\n  accuracy by the transit of Venus, which gives 9^h 10′ 6″; and your\r\n  eclipse gives, 9^h 10′ 3″, or 5^h 0′ 43″ in relation to Greenwich.\r\n\r\n  “What has given me still greater pleasure, is, that the duration of\r\n  the ring, as you observed it, agrees very well with the diameters of\r\n  the Sun and of the Moon, which T have adopted in the third edition of\r\n  my _Astronomy_ (1792), and the diminutions that I there propose for\r\n  eclipses; viz. 3″½ to be taken from the diameter of the Sun, and 2″\r\n  from that of the Moon.[293]\r\n\r\n  “I pray you to make many compliments for me, to the astronomers whom I\r\n  know, in your country, Mr. Willard at Beverley and Mr. Williams at\r\n  Cambridge: Is there any other astronomer, now, who applies himself\r\n  seriously to astronomy? I greet you with health and brotherhood.\r\n\r\n                                                      “LALANDE.\r\n                           “Professor of Astronomy, and Inspector of the\r\n                           College of France,[294] Cambray Place.“\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 292:\r\n\r\n  The continuation of the 6th volume of the American Philosophical\r\n  Transactions (published in 1809) contains various observations on the\r\n  Annular Eclipse of the 3d of April, 1791, made at Greenwich, Paris,\r\n  Cambridge in New-England, Philadelphia, and George-Town in Maryland. A\r\n  recapitulation of the results of the longitudes of Philadelphia and\r\n  Cambridge, west from Paris, is made from the Transit of Venus, in\r\n  1769; the Transits of Mercury, in 1782 and 1789; this Annular Eclipse\r\n  of the Sun, in 1791, and a Solar Eclipse, in 1806; the mean results of\r\n  which, give\r\n\r\n    The Long. of Philadelphia,  W. from Paris, 5^h 10′. 01″,2\r\n       Do.    of Cambridge,          Do.       4.           53.  53\r\n\r\n  These observations were communicated to the Philosophical Society by\r\n  Don Joseph J. Ferrer, of Cadiz, a very respectable astronomer, and a\r\n  foreign member of the Am. Philos. Society.\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  In the annular eclipse of the sun, on the 3d of April, 1791, as\r\n  observed at Philadelphia by Mr. Rittenhouse, the formation of the ring\r\n  is stated at 6^h 46′ 11½″ A. M. true time; and its rupture, at 6^h 50′\r\n  28″. “I have,” says Mr. Lalande (in his _Additions_, 1797,) “reduced\r\n  the conjunction of it to 7^h 41′ 19″, and the difference of meridians\r\n  5^h 10′ 3″, greater by 7″ than that given by Mr. Rittenhouse. This\r\n  duration of the ring, gives for the latitude in conjunction 44′ 57″,\r\n  which confirms the value of the diameters of the sun and of the moon,\r\n  that I have given in the 3d edition of my _Astronomy_, and the\r\n  diminution that I make in the eclipses, 3½″ for the ray of the sun,\r\n  and 2″ for that of the moon. I have subtracted one minute of the time\r\n  marked in the third volume of the Transactions of the Society of\r\n  Philadelphia, for the formation and the rupture of the ring; but this\r\n  correction was pointed out to me by the termination of the eclipse, as\r\n  well as by the difference of meridians, which was ascertained by the\r\n  Transit of Venus over the Sun.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 294:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lalande was first appointed to that station, in the year 1761.\r\n  “The College of France,” heretofore styled “The Royal College of\r\n  France,” was originally founded in the year 1530, by Francis I. but\r\n  letters patent were issued in favour of it in 1772, by the unfortunate\r\n  Louis XVI. The present edifice, finished in 1775, gave new activity to\r\n  the ancient establishment; and Lalande viewed it, when he wrote his\r\n  _Astronomie_, as having been one of the best schools in the world for\r\n  the sciences, but principally for astronomy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe mind of Dr. Rittenhouse, ever intent on doing, good, was always\r\nzealously engaged on occasions which afforded him opportunities of\r\ncontributing to the rewards of merit and the promotion of beneficial\r\nestablishments, or useful undertakings of any kind.\r\n\r\nSuch an occasion presented itself, at the close of the year 1795. His\r\nnephew Dr. B. S. Barton, to whom he was attached by the strongest ties\r\nof friendship, then held the Professorship of Botany and Natural History\r\nin the University of Pennsylvania: but a vacancy being at that time\r\nexpected in the chair of the Materia Medica, which branch of medicine\r\nwas then taught by Dr. Samuel Powell Griffitts, Dr. Rittenhouse exerted\r\nhimself to obtain that appointment for his nephew; upon whom it was\r\nconferred soon after, in conjunction with the chair he already occupied.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the gratification of his anxious wishes, in the\r\nattainment of this object, Dr. Rittenhouse addressed himself personally\r\nto some of his colleagues in the board of trustees of the University:\r\nand to Dr. M‘Kean, president of that board, he wrote the following\r\nletter[295] on the subject.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 295:\r\n\r\n  The original letter was politely presented to the author, by his\r\n  venerable friend, the profound Lawyer and distinguished Patriot to\r\n  whom it was addressed. On that occasion, Governor M‘Kean expressed\r\n  himself in terms of the highest respect and kindest regard for the\r\n  memory of Dr. Rittenhouse, as one of his friends, whom, while living,\r\n  he greatly valued for his talents and esteemed for his virtues.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                                       “_Philadelphia, Dec. 26th, 1795._\r\n\r\n  “Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n      “I am informed that Dr. Griffitts intends to resign his\r\n  Professorship in the University, sometime this winter. On this\r\n  occasion, I beg leave to recommend to your favourable notice my\r\n  nephew, Dr. Barton. He certainly has abilities sufficient to enable\r\n  him to be useful in any branch of medicine, and ambition enough to\r\n  induce him to make the greatest exertions: Besides, the Materia Medica\r\n  seems so nearly connected with Botany and Natural History, his\r\n  favourite studies, that I flatter myself he will be successful in his\r\n  intended application to the honourable Board of Trustees; yet I am\r\n  certain this will much depend on your interest. I am, Dear Sir, with\r\n  the sincerest affection and esteem, your most obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                “DAVID RITTENHOUSE.[296]\r\n\r\n         (Superscribed.)\r\n   “Hon.

Even\r\n  his hand-writing,” said he, “in which this weakness so frequently\r\n  discovers itself, was simple and intelligible at first sight, to all\r\n  who saw it.” As a specimen of this, a _fac simile_ of the letter in\r\n  the text is presented to the reader.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[Illustration: letter]\r\n\r\nThe affectionate regard and high respect which Professor Barton\r\nuniformly cherished for the person and character of this worthy\r\nrelative,—who, on all occasions, evinced himself to be his sincere\r\nfriend,—cannot be better manifested, than by citing his own words. In\r\nhis dedication to Dr. Rittenhouse, of a dessertation, entitled, _A\r\nMemoir concerning the fascinating faculty which has been ascribed to the\r\nRattle-Snake and other American Serpents_, is this passage—“In\r\ninscribing this Memoir to you, dear sir, I follow the regular course of\r\nmy feelings, which, when I have received acts of friendship or kindness,\r\never lead me to acknowledge them. Whilst your example early implanted in\r\nme an ardent love of science, the assistance which you afforded me, by\r\nremoving many of the obstacles that have opposed my advancement in life,\r\nhas enabled me to devote a portion of my time to the cultivation of\r\nscience; and thereby to increase the quantity of my happiness:” This was\r\nwritten just four months before the decease of our Philosopher. And in a\r\nsubsequent inscription by the same gentleman,—that of his _New Views of\r\nthe Origin of the Tribes and Nations of America_,—dedicated to Mr.\r\nJefferson, and dated about a year after that event, he says: “The only\r\ndedications I ever wrote, were to two persons[297] whom I greatly\r\nesteemed and loved; the last, to a common friend, whose virtues and\r\nscience endeared him to his country, and whose removal from us, we shall\r\nlong have reason to deplore.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 297:\r\n\r\n  The first of these, in the order of time, was his eldest brother, the\r\n  writer of these memoirs; the other was his uncle, Dr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSoon after Dr. Priestley’s arrival in Pennsylvania, our Philosopher\r\nbecame personally acquainted with him, and presently conceived for his\r\nfellow-labourer in science a sincere esteem. This was reciprocal; and,\r\ntherefore, while the celebrated English philosopher remained in\r\nPhiladelphia, and also when he occasionally visited that city after his\r\nremoval to the town of Northumberland on the Susquehanna, he passed much\r\nof his time in Dr. Rittenhouse’s family. So far as the pursuits of these\r\ngentlemen, in matters of science, were congenial—for, in some respects\r\nthey were very dissimilar,—their opinions appeared to harmonize with\r\neach other: but, how far their sentiments accorded on other subjects, or\r\nwhether at all, the Writer cannot undertake to pronounce; not possessing\r\nthe necessary means to enable him to do so with a sufficient degree of\r\ncertainty. Dr. Rittenhouse’s intercourse with Dr. Priestley, either\r\npersonal or epistolary, was, however, of short duration; being\r\nterminated by the death of the former, in little more than two years\r\nafter the latter first came to Philadelphia. One of the last interviews\r\nwhich Dr. Rittenhouse had with his friend Priestley, was very shortly\r\nbefore our philosopher’s death: he was one of a select few whom the\r\nwriter had the pleasure of meeting at Dr. Rittenhouse’s, to dine, on the\r\n18th of March, 1796.\r\n\r\nThat learned and eminent foreigner,—for Dr. Priestley never became a\r\nnaturalized citizen of the United States,—died at Northumberland in\r\nPennsylvania, at an advanced age, on the 6th day of February 1804.\r\n\r\nThe scanty remnant of life that yet remained to the great American\r\nAstronomer and Mathematician, was neither uselessly, nor altogether\r\nunpleasantly employed. In this interval of time, short as it was, such\r\nportions of it as afforded him some respite from sickness and pain, were\r\neither devoted to the society of his family and friends, or occupied in\r\nstudy. From these sources of rational enjoyment, be derived much\r\ncomfort; and the solace he drew from them, was greatly heightened by the\r\nendearing attentions, which, amidst the rapid decline of his health and\r\nstrength, he experienced, in an eminent degree, in the bosom of his\r\naffectionate family and some surrounding relatives. He was fully\r\nsensible of the approaching crisis of his disease; and he appeared to be\r\nquite prepared to meet the awful stroke, with the fortitude which a\r\nretrospective view of a well-spent life would naturally inspire; as well\r\nas with the resignation, which an entire confidence in the goodness, the\r\nwisdom, and the mercy of his omnipotent Creator, taught him to be a\r\nduty. His elevated conceptions of the Deity, together with his decided\r\nbelief of the immortality of the soul, according at the same time with\r\nthe doctrines of a pure religion, animated him with the stedfast hope of\r\nan happy futurity, worthy of a Christian and a Philosopher. His intimate\r\nknowledge of the sublimest works of creation, rendered him highly\r\nsensible of the wisdom and power of the Great Supreme; while that\r\nknowledge, aided by the lights furnished by the Christian dispensation,\r\nled him to ascribe suitable attributes to the Author of Nature,—a Being\r\ninfinitely good, as well as perfect: for, as he once familiarly\r\nexpressed himself,[298] he was “firmly persuaded, that we are not at the\r\ndisposal of a Being, who has the least tincture of ill-nature, or\r\nrequires any in us.”[299]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 298:\r\n\r\n  In a letter written to the Rev. Mr. Barton, in Sept. 1755, when the\r\n  writer was little more than twenty-three years of age.\r\n\r\nFootnote 299:\r\n\r\n  The extract from a letter to one of his friends, which Dr. Rush has\r\n  quoted in his _Eulogium_ on Rittenhouse, furnishes additional\r\n  testimony, if, indeed, any were wanting, of the exalted sense of\r\n  Divine Goodness, that was entertained by our pious philosopher: “Give\r\n  me leave,” says he, “to mention two or three proofs of infinite\r\n  Goodness, in the works of Creation. The first is, possessing goodness\r\n  in ourselves. Now it is inconsistent with all just reasoning to\r\n  suppose, that there is any thing good, lovely or praiseworthy, in us,\r\n  which is not possessed in an infinitely higher degree by that Being\r\n  who first called us into existence. In the next place, I reckon the\r\n  exquisite and innocent delight, that many things around us are\r\n  calculated to afford us. In this light, the beauty and fragrance of a\r\n  single rose is a better argument for Divine Goodness, than a luxuriant\r\n  field of wheat. For, if we can suppose that we were created by a\r\n  malevolent Being, with a design to torment us for his amusement, he\r\n  must have furnished us with the means of subsistence, and either have\r\n  made our condition tolerable, or not have left the means of quitting\r\n  it at pleasure, in our own power. Such being my opinions, you will not\r\n  wonder at my fondness for what Mr. Addison calls _The Pleasures of\r\n  Imagination_: they are all, to me, so many demonstrations of Infinite\r\n  Goodness.”\r\n\r\n  That such were also the sentiments of one of the greatest philosophers\r\n  of the seventeenth century, a man alike celebrated as a profound\r\n  Mathematician, and a learned and pious Divine, is apparent from the\r\n  following passage, in the first of Dr. Barrow’s two _Discourses on the\r\n  Goodness of God_.\r\n\r\n  “Every pleasant object we view, every sweet and savoury morsel we\r\n  taste, every fragrancy we smell, every harmony we hear; the wholesome,\r\n  the cheering, the useful, yea, the innocent and inoffensive qualities\r\n  of every thing we do use and enjoy,” said this excellent person, “are\r\n  so many conspicuous arguments of Divine Goodness.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt is an observation of a judicious biographer,[A] that “nothing can\r\nawaken the attention, nothing affect the heart of man, more strongly,\r\nthan the behaviour of eminent personages in their last moments; in that\r\nonly scene of life where we are all sure, later or sooner, to resemble\r\nthem.” The writer of these Memoirs feels a sort of pensive\r\ngratification, in having it in his power to announce the manner in which\r\nthe great American Astronomer deported himself, during the closing scene\r\nof his life: The following information on this head, was communicated by\r\nthe writer’s brother, Professor Barton, the deceased’s nephew and\r\nfriend,—for some years, also, his family-physician; and who, in his\r\nmedical capacity, attended him in the whole of his last illness.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Mallet, in his Life of Lord Chancellor Bacon.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n“The last visit I ever received from Mr. Rittenhouse was about the\r\nmiddle of June, 1796. He called at my humble habitation in Fifth street,\r\nto inquire about my health, and to learn from me the result of the\r\nexperiments and inquiries in which he knew I was, at this time engaged,\r\nconcerning the mode of generation and gestation of our opossum, an\r\nanimal to whose economy and manners he had himself paid some attention,\r\nand whose history he justly considered one of the most interesting in\r\nthe whole range of zoology.\r\n\r\n“It was on this occasion, that our excellent friend first informed me,\r\nthat he had received a diploma from the Royal Society. He observed, with\r\na tone of voice and with a certain expression of countenance, which were\r\nnot calculated to afford me any pleasure, “that a few years ago, such a\r\nmark of respect from that illustrious body would have been received by\r\nhim with pleasure and with pride.”\r\n\r\n“In fact, Mr. Rittenhouse, now and for some months past, was strongly\r\nimpressed with the idea, that his career of usefulness and virtue was\r\nnearly at an end. He had several times, during the preceding part of the\r\nspring and summer, intimated to me (and doubtless to others of his\r\nfriends) his impressions on this head. In what precise condition of his\r\nsystem, whether physical or intellectual, these impressions were\r\nfounded, I have only been able to form a distant, and unsatisfactory\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\n“A few days after this interview, viz. on the 22d of June, I was sent\r\nfor to visit Mr. Rittenhouse. I found him in his garden, where he loved\r\nto walk, and soon learned that he laboured under a severe attack of\r\ncholera, accompanied, however, with more fever than we generally find\r\nwith this disease; and with a great increase of that violent pain and\r\nsense of oppression at the region of his stomach, to which he had been\r\nsubject for at least thirty years. Notwithstanding his age, the debility\r\nof his system, and the unfavourable state of the season, I ventured to\r\nflatter myself, that the attack would not prove mortal. On the following\r\nday, however, finding him no better, but rather worse, I requested\r\npermission to call in the aid of another physician; and having mentioned\r\nthe name of Dr. Adam Kuhn, that gentleman accordingly visited our\r\nfriend, in company with me, during the remainder of his illness.\r\n\r\nHis febrile symptoms being very urgent, it was thought necessary to\r\nbleed our patient; and notwithstanding his great and habitual repugnance\r\nto the practice on former occasions, he now readily consented to the\r\noperation, on condition that I would perform it myself. The blood which\r\nwas drawn, exhibited a pretty strong inflammatory crust; and the\r\noperation seemed to give him a temporary relief from his pain. Soon\r\nafter this, his strength gradually declined; and on the third day of his\r\nillness, it was but too obvious, that our illustrious relative was soon\r\nto be separated from his friends. He expired without a struggle, and in\r\nthe calmest manner, ten minutes before two o’clock on the morning of\r\nSunday the 26th, in the presence of his youngest daughter, Mrs. Waters,\r\nand myself. His excellent wife, who had ever been assiduous in her\r\nattention on her husband, both in sickness and in health, had retired\r\nfrom his chamber about two hours before, unable to support the awful\r\nscene of expiring genius and virtue.\r\n\r\n“There can be no doubt, I think, that Mr. Rittenhouse, from the first\r\ninvasion of his disease, or at least from the day when he was confined\r\nto his bed or room, entertained but little hopes of his recovery. He\r\nsigned his will in my presence. He discovered no more solicitude about\r\nhis situation, than it is decorous and proper in every good or great man\r\nto feel, when in a similar situation. During the greater part of his\r\nillness, he manifested the most happy temperament of mind: and it was\r\nonly in the last hour or two of his life, that his powerful intellects\r\nwere disturbed by a mild delirium. About eight hours before he died, the\r\npain in the region of his stomach being unusually severe, a poultice\r\ncomposed of meal and laudanum was applied to the part. In less than two\r\nhours after the application, I called to see him, and upon asking him if\r\nhe did not feel easier, he calmly answered, in these memorable words,\r\nwhich it is impossible for me to forget,—for they were the last he ever\r\ndistinctly uttered, and they make us acquainted with the two most\r\nimportant features in his religious creed,—“Yes, you have made the way\r\nto God easier!”\r\n\r\n“Such were the dying words, as it were, of our illustrious relative and\r\nfriend. He was dear to us both, to all his relatives and friends; and to\r\nhis country. To me, let me add, he was _peculiarly_ dear. The most happy\r\nand profitable hours of my life were passed in the society of this\r\nvirtuous man. I followed his foot-steps in the wilderness of our\r\ncountry, where he was the first to carry the telescope, and to mark the\r\nmotions and positions of the planets. In the bosom of his family, I\r\nlistened to his lessons, as an humble disciple of Socrates, or Plato.\r\nScience mixed with virtue was ever inculcated from his lips.—But to me,\r\nMr. Rittenhouse was more than a friend and preceptor. He was a father\r\nand supporter. He laid the foundation of what little prosperity in life\r\nI now, or may in future, enjoy: and if it shall ever be my fortune,\r\neither by my labours or my zeal, to advance the progress of science, or\r\nto reflect any honour upon my country, I should be the most ungrateful\r\nof men, if I did not acknowledge, and wish it to be known, that it was\r\nDAVID RITTENHOUSE who enabled me to be useful.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\nSuch was the death of DAVID RITTENHOUSE,—soon after his entrance into\r\nthe sixty-fifth year of his age:—“Thus, with a heart overflowing with\r\nlove to his family, friends, country, and to the whole world, he\r\npeacefully resigned his spirit into the hands of his God.”[300] Thus did\r\nhis immortal soul gently pass away, from this transitory but variegated\r\nscene; from a theatre of mingled afflictions and comforts, of privations\r\nand enjoyments, of absolute certainty with respect to the\r\nnon-continuance of this state, and of equal incertitude as to our\r\npossible knowledge of the term of its duration:—And it is most\r\nconfidently believed, that his departed spirit, while yet hovering on\r\nthe confines of time, devoutly relied on being “promoted to a more\r\nexalted rank among the creatures of God.”[301]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  Rush’s Eulog. on Ritt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 301:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE CONCLUSION:\r\n                             COMPREHENDING\r\n                        A RETROSPECT OF THE LIFE\r\n                                   OF\r\n                           DAVID RITTENHOUSE,\r\n\r\n                                  WITH\r\n\r\n                    A DELINEATION OF HIS CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It has been the fashion of late years,” says his eloquent\r\nEulogist,[302] “to say of persons who had been distinguished in\r\nlife,—when they left the world in a state of indifference to every\r\nthing, and believing and hoping in nothing,—that _they died like\r\nPhilosophers_.” RITTENHOUSE did not, indeed, die like a disciple of that\r\nnew philosophy, referred to by the Eulogist,—like some of those modern\r\npretenders to _illumination_, who have been struggling to resuscitate\r\nall the maddening dreams and absurdities of the Pyrrhonists of old: His\r\nlast hours were similar to those, which graced the departure from the\r\nworld, of a Newton and a Boyle, with very many illustrious Christians\r\nbesides, who truly deserved the name of Philosophers;—for, “_he died\r\nlike a Christian_, interested in the welfare of all around him—believing\r\nin the resurrection, and the life to come, and hoping for happiness from\r\nevery attribute of the Deity.”[303]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 302:\r\n\r\n  Rush’s Eulog. on Ritt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 303:\r\n\r\n  “Astronomy, like the Christian religion, if you will allow me the\r\n  comparison,” said our philosopher, “has a much greater influence on\r\n  our knowledge in general, and perhaps on our manners too, than is\r\n  commonly imagined. Though but few men are its particular votaries, yet\r\n  the Light it affords is universally diffused among us; and it is\r\n  difficult for us to divest ourselves of its influence so far, as to\r\n  frame any competent idea of what would be our situation without it.”\r\n  See Ritt. Orat.\r\n\r\n  In another part of his Oration is this passage—“Our Religion teaches\r\n  us what Philosophy could not have taught: and we ought to admire, with\r\n  reverence, the great things it has pleased Divine Providence to\r\n  perform, beyond the ordinary course of nature, for man, who is,\r\n  undoubtedly, the most noble inhabitant of this globe,” &c.\r\n\r\n  And in addition to these sentiments, uttered and published by our\r\n  philosopher himself, let the testimony of Dr. Rush, who had long and\r\n  intimately known him, be quoted, from the learned professor’s\r\n  _Eulogium_: “He believed in the Christian Revelation,” says the\r\n  Doctor; and then subjoins—“Of this he gave many proofs; not only in\r\n  the conformity of his life to the precepts of the Gospel, but in his\r\n  letters and conversation.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBy his last will and testament, which was not executed till the day\r\npreceding his death, Dr. Rittenhouse disposed of his estate in a very\r\nequitable manner, between Mrs. Rittenhouse and his two daughters,\r\nbesides making a liberal provision for an amiable widowed sister, so\r\nlong as she should live.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from an estimate of his estate made by himself, (and\r\nsupposed to have been drawn up about a year before his death,) that all\r\nthe property he ever acquired, independently of his patrimony, which he\r\nvalued at one thousand pounds, actually cost him only 13,525_l._:[304]\r\nand the whole of his estate was estimated, at the time of his decease,\r\nat scarcely twenty thousand pounds. When it is considered, that the\r\ntalents of this very extraordinary man were actively and industriously\r\nemployed more than forty years, from the time he attained to manhood,\r\nduring many years of which period, he was engaged in various public\r\noccupations, and some of them lucrative; that he was prudent and exact\r\nin all his transactions, private as well as public, and economical in\r\nhis domestic expenditures; and that his family was small;—when all these\r\nconsiderations are taken into view, they furnish matter of surprize that\r\nhe should not have accumulated a larger fortune! Indeed the moderate\r\namount of the estate he left, affords reasonable grounds for supposing,\r\nthat he devoted more of his property to purposes of beneficence, than\r\nthe world had any opportunity of becoming acquainted with.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 304:\r\n\r\n  Equivalent to 36,066⅔ American or Spanish dollars.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse survived both his sons-in-law; and their widows[305] are\r\nhis only remaining children. He constituted these daughters, with Mrs.\r\nRittenhouse, the executrices of his will.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 305:\r\n\r\n  The elder of these ladies became, in the year 1788, the second wife of\r\n  Jonathan Dickinson Sergeant, Esq. late an eminent lawyer in\r\n  Philadelphia, and sometime attorney-general of Pennsylvania. This\r\n  gentleman was one of the five persons delegated, on the 20th of\r\n  February, 1776, by the convention of New-Jersey (where he then\r\n  resided,) to represent that colony in congress: his colleagues were,\r\n  the late governor Livingston, and John de Hart, Richard Smith, and\r\n  John Cooper, Esquires. Mr. Sergeant died of the yellow fever in\r\n  Philadelphia, on the 8th of October, 1793; after having been many\r\n  weeks actively and benevolently employed, with a few other gentlemen\r\n  of humanity, in the prosecution of such measures, as the sufferings of\r\n  those of the citizens who had not fled, and the general welfare of the\r\n  city required, at that calamitous period. He left issue a son and two\r\n  daughters, by this marriage, besides several children by his first\r\n  wife.\r\n\r\n  The other daughter of Dr. Rittenhouse was married in the year 1790, to\r\n  Nicholas Baker Waters, M. D. of Philadelphia, a young physician of\r\n  respectable talents and amiable disposition. Dr. Waters died of a\r\n  pulmonary disease, in August, 1794, at a very early age, leaving one\r\n  son, an only child.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse named his second daughter, Esther, in compliment to\r\n  his sister Barton. In a letter to the Rev. Mr. Barton, written on the\r\n  occasion of the birth of this younger child, he says—“To me, it is a\r\n  matter of indifference, but to my Eleanor it was a great\r\n  disappointment, to have a girl, having promised herself a boy; and it\r\n  had long since been resolved that this child, if a son, should be\r\n  called Thomas, after yourself.” The eldest daughter was named\r\n  Elizabeth, after his own mother.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe remains of our philosopher were deposited, agreeably to a desire he\r\nhad expressed long before his death, beneath the pavement within the\r\nsmall Observatory which he erected many years before, in the garden\r\nadjoining his house; and over the body was placed a plain slab of\r\nmarble, inscribed only with his name, the time of his decease, and his\r\nage. Although it was intended that his interment should be attended by\r\nhis family-connexions alone,—in consequence of which, no other persons\r\nwere asked to the funeral,—a numerous body of his friends voluntarily\r\npresented themselves on the occasion, as a mark of their respect for his\r\nmemory. The Rev. Dr. Green was one of the number; and this clergyman,\r\nbeing then the pastor of the congregation in which the deceased had\r\noften attended divine worship in the latter years of his life, delivered\r\na short but appropriate address to a surrounding auditory of mourning\r\nand afflicted friends.—“_This_,” began the reverend orator, pointing to\r\nthe tomb of our philosopher, as just described,—“_This_ is,\r\nemphatically, _the Tomb of Genius and of Science_! Their child, their\r\nmartyr, is here deposited,—and their friends will make his Eulogy, in\r\ntears. I stand not here, to pronounce it; the thought that engrosses my\r\nmind, is this;—how much more clear and impressive must be the views,\r\nwhich the late Spiritual Inhabitant of that lifeless corpse now\r\npossesses of GOD,—of his infinite existence, of his adorable attributes\r\nand of that eternal blaze of glory which emanates from Him,—than when\r\nshe was blinded by her veil of flesh! Accustomed, as she was, to\r\npenetrate far into the universe,—far as corporeal or mental vision here\r\ncan reach,—still, what new and extensive scenes of wonder have opened on\r\nher eyes, enlightened and invigorated by death! The Discoveries of\r\nRITTENHOUSE, since he died, have already been more, and greater, than\r\nwhile he lived.[306] Yes; and, could he address us from the spiritual\r\nworld, his language would be—\r\n\r\n              “All, all on Earth is shadow, all Beyond\r\n              Is substance; the reverse is folly’s creed.”\r\n\r\nProceeding with a fervid expression of many excellent and pious\r\nsentiments, excited by the occasion and well adapted to it, the orator\r\nthus concluded:—“Filled with these reflections, let us go from this\r\nTomb, and resolve to aim at the high destiny of our nature. Rightly\r\naiming at this, we shall fill up life with usefulness and duty; we shall\r\nbear its burdens with patience; and we shall look forward to its close\r\nwith pleasure: we shall consider death but as the birth of a new and\r\nnobler existence,—as a dark but short passage to the regions of eternal\r\nday; and, in the very agony of our change, we may exclaim in triumph,—‘O\r\nDeath, where is thy Sting! O Grave where is thy Victory!’—Thanks be to\r\nGod! who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 306:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rush has very beautifully expressed the same sentiment, in a\r\n  passage of his _Eulogium_ on our philosopher. After remarking, that\r\n  his bodily infirmities “contributed much to the perfection of his\r\n  virtue, by producing habitual patience and resignation to the will of\r\n  heaven, and a constant eye to the hour of his dissolution,” he says:\r\n  “It was a window through which he often looked with pleasure towards a\r\n  place of existence, where, from the increase and perfection of his\r\n  intuitive faculties, he would probably acquire more knowledge in an\r\n  hour, than he had acquired in his whole life, by the slow operations\r\n  of reason; and where, from the greater magnitude and extent of the\r\n  objects of his contemplation, his native globe would appear like his\r\n  cradle, and all the events of time, like the amusements of his infant\r\n  years.” Such, too, must have been the ideas, impressed on the mind of\r\n  Rittenhouse himself, when, in the morning of his life, he imagined the\r\n  angel Gabriel looking down from the seat of perfect knowledge, and\r\n  viewing, benignly, far from beholding with a smile of contempt, the\r\n  efforts of Newton, to demonstrate the actual motion of our earth. W.\r\n  B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse was, in his stature, somewhat tall; in his person,\r\nslender and straight; and although his constitution was delicate, his\r\nbodily frame did not appear to have been, originally, weak: his gait was\r\nsomewhat quick, and his movements in general were lively; insomuch, that\r\nit is probable he possessed a good deal of corporeal activity, in early\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHis face was of an oval form; his complexion, fair; and his hair, which\r\nin his latter years became thinned and whitened, was brown. All his\r\nfeatures were good: his forehead was high, capacious and smooth; his\r\neyes, which were of a greyish colour, were alike expressive of\r\nanimation, reflection and good nature, and well placed under full,\r\narched brows; his nose was large, handsome, and inclined to the\r\naquiline; his mouth, well-formed, though a little prominent, and\r\ncorresponding with the general character of the face; and his chin,\r\nbroad and strong. In short, his whole countenance was indicative of\r\nintelligence, complacency and goodness, even after its characteristic\r\nmarks had been in some degree impaired by sickness and years. Dr. Rush\r\nobserves, that his countenance was too remarkable to be unnoticed. “It\r\ndisplayed,” says the Doctor, “such a mixture of contemplation,\r\nbenignity, and innocence, that it was easy to distinguish his person in\r\nthe largest company, by a previous knowledge of his character.”[307]\r\nSuch were, upon the whole, the figure and appearance of David\r\nRittenhouse; but more particularly, in his earlier life: and, as thus\r\ndescribed, he was generally considered an handsome man.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 307:\r\n\r\n  See Eulog. on Ritt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMany indications of the respect and esteem entertained for the memory of\r\nthis distinguished man, appeared soon after his death: among others may\r\nbe mentioned the following.\r\n\r\nMr. Adet, then minister plenipotentiary from “The French Republic” to\r\nthe United States, and resident in Philadelphia, addressed a letter on\r\nthe subject of Dr. Rittenhouse, under the date of “19th Messidor, the\r\n4th year of the French Republic” (answering to the 7th of July, 1806, of\r\nthe Christian Calendar,) to the writer of these Memoirs. This\r\ngentleman—who was represented to be a man of considerable attainments in\r\nscience, and was besides a member of the American Philosophical Society,\r\nprofessed, in that letter, _a great desire to make the name of\r\nRittenhouse known in his country_,—for so he expressed himself; meaning,\r\nfor that purpose, (as he said,) to transmit “to the National Institute\r\nof France an historical notice of his life and labours.” With this view,\r\nhe accompanied his letter with a list of queries (twenty-five in\r\nnumber,) requesting the Memorialist to furnish answers to them; which\r\nwas accordingly done, in a succinct manner: but whether the information\r\nthe answers contained was ever applied to the purpose for which the\r\nquerist stated them to be designed, the answerer has never ascertained.\r\nHe will, however, conclude his observations on this part of his subject,\r\nwith barely remarking, that the last of the proposed queries is in these\r\nwords——“How did he bear the approaches of death?—did he die like a\r\nPhilosopher?”\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of general notoriety, that Thomas Jefferson, Esq. of\r\nVirginia, (late President of the United States,) succeeded Dr.\r\nRittenhouse in the Presidency of the American Philosophical Society;\r\nhaving been first elected to that station on the 6th of January, 1797,\r\nwhile he officiated as Secretary of State, and during his residence in\r\nPhiladelphia. Of this appointment, Mr. Jefferson was duly notified, by a\r\nletter addressed to him by the Secretaries, in behalf of the society:\r\nand, in his reply to that communication, the president-elect paid a just\r\ntribute of respect to the character of his great and virtuous\r\npredecessor, in these concise terms:—“Permit me to avail myself of this\r\nopportunity of expressing the sincere grief I feel, for the loss of our\r\nbeloved Rittenhouse. Genius, science, modesty, purity of morals,\r\nsimplicity of manners, marked him as one of nature’s best samples of the\r\nperfection she can cover under the human form. Surely no society, till\r\nours, within the same compass of time,[308] ever had to deplore the loss\r\nof two such members as FRANKLIN and RITTENHOUSE.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  About twenty-six years and an half.—Dr. Franklin was President from\r\n  the institution of the society, in Jan. 1769, until his death, on the\r\n  17th of April, 1790; and Dr. Rittenhouse, who succeeded him in Jan.\r\n  1791, continued in the office until he died, the 26th of June, 1796.\r\n  W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn England, the talents of Dr. Rittenhouse were well known, and his\r\nworth duly appreciated. Of this, no better evidence can be required,\r\nthan the spontaneous admission of him, by the Royal Society of London,\r\ninto a Fellowship of their illustrious body. But, as a further proof of\r\nthe high respect in which his character was held in that country, the\r\nobituary notice of him, which appeared in the _European Magazine_, (a\r\nperiodical work of merit and taste,) for July, 1796, is inserted in the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\nBesides other evidences which appeared, soon after the decease of our\r\nmost distinguished philosopher, demonstrate the high estimation in which\r\nhis character was held, by some eminent men in official stations,\r\nseveral private gentlemen of worth and erudition, have, long since,\r\ncontinued to manifest a laudable disposition either to erect, or to\r\ninstitute, some respectable and suitable memorial in honour of his name:\r\nand it can scarcely be doubted, that a grateful sense of his exemplary\r\nvirtues, his transcendent talents and important public services, will\r\nyet effect the accomplishment of some such patriotic design. An\r\nhonourable effort of this kind by a number of liberal and public\r\nspirited gentlemen of the county of Chester, in Pennsylvania, has\r\nrecently been made: and notwithstanding the failure of the attempt, it\r\nis due to the merit of those individuals who were most zealous in their\r\nendeavours to accomplish the object, to notice their benevolent\r\nintentions on the occasion. In the autumn of the year 1811, the sum of\r\nnearly eight thousand dollars was subscribed, towards the purpose of\r\nerecting and endowing an Academy within the borough of West-Chester.\r\nDoctor William Darlington, with some other friends of literature and\r\nscience in his neighbourhood, proposed to name the designed institution\r\n“_The Rittenhouse Academy_:” but as the establishment of a similar one,\r\nin a distant part of the same county, was at the same time contemplated;\r\nand, as the subscriptions to that proposed to be established in\r\nWest-Chester, were, in the first instance, chiefly obtained in different\r\nparts of the county, for an institution then proposed to be called “The\r\n_West-Chester_ Academy”—thus locating its situation exclusively to that\r\nborough; it was not deemed expedient to vary the chartered name of this\r\nAcademy, when it should be incorporated, from the one by which it was\r\noriginally designated.\r\n\r\nSuch were the causes of the disappointment, in relation to the proposed\r\n_Rittenhouse Academy_: but they are evidently such as cannot in the\r\nsmallest degree detract from the meritorious intentions of those\r\ngentlemen, who were desirous of giving the institution, in West-Chester,\r\nthat respectable name; nor are they less indicative of the respect which\r\nwas intended to be shewn to the memory of Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, to the evidence which has been tendered by others\r\nto the exalted merits of our Philosopher, the memorialist is happy in\r\nhaving an opportunity to introduce, on this occasion, the testimony of a\r\ngentleman who was very long and intimately acquainted with Dr.\r\nRittenhouse—and, consequently, well knew his worth as a man. This\r\nrepresentation being likewise made by a person whose conspicuous\r\nattainments in similar departments of science, and arduous employments\r\nin practical pursuits of the same description, render him eminently\r\nqualified to judge of his deceased friend’s talents, he is by these\r\nmeans enabled to form a just estimate of his character. The person here\r\nreferred to, is Andrew Ellicott, Esq. a gentleman with whom the writer\r\nof these Memoirs has been in habits of intimacy and friendship, many\r\nyears. The information on this subject, communicated by Mr. Ellicott,\r\nbeing in the form of a letter addressed to the memorialist, he has given\r\nthat communication a place in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Rittenhouse had failings, cannot be questioned; since, to\r\npossess them, is the lot of every individual of our species. But his\r\nfoibles—of whatever description they may have been—may be compared to\r\nsome opaque spots, minute in size, which the prying eye of the\r\nastronomer has discovered to exist even on the glorious orb of the Sun;\r\nalthough these little _maculæ_ are scarcely discernible by the\r\ngenerality of observers, by reason of the surrounding splendour of his\r\nbeams: so, the diminutive failings which may be supposed to have existed\r\nin the character of our philosophical luminary, were rendered almost\r\nimperceptible, by the resplendency in which his great and numerous\r\nvirtues were enveloped. It was said of that sublime artist, Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds, by the late celebrated Edmund Burke, that he did “not know a\r\nfault or weakness of his, that he did not convert into something that\r\nbordered on a virtue, instead of pushing it to the confines of a\r\nvice.”[309] Dr. Rittenhouse, in like manner, was perfectly\r\nuncontaminated by any vice; while “his virtues furnish the most shining\r\nmodels for imitation:” and, in regard even to his foibles, the\r\ndeclaration of his Eulogist, just quoted, that his virtues “were never\r\nobscured, in any situation or stage of his life, by a single cloud of\r\nweakness or vice,”[310] may be fairly received in the same liberal\r\nsense, as Mr. Burke’s expression concerning his worthy friend, Reynolds.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 309:\r\n\r\n  See Mr. Malone’s Account of the Life and Writings of Sir Joshua\r\n  Reynolds, prefixed to the works of Sir Joshua.\r\n\r\nFootnote 310:\r\n\r\n  See Rush’s Eulog. on Ritt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf a retrospect be now taken of the whole Life of our Philosopher, in\r\nwhatever points of view it may be contemplated, the following\r\ncharacteristic traits will be found to be faithfully delineated;\r\nalthough it is at the same time acknowledged, that the portrait is still\r\ntoo incomplete to afford a perfect resemblance to the excellent\r\ncharacter of the original.\r\n\r\nIn his temper, Dr. Rittenhouse was naturally placid and good-humoured;\r\nyet sometimes grave, and inclined to pensiveness. He was occasionally,\r\nthough seldom, animated by a considerable degree of warmth: but he did\r\nnot suffer himself to be influenced, on any occasion, by impetuous\r\npassions; nor did any man ever possess a temper more placable. His\r\ngeneral deportment was gentle, unassuming and cheerful; such as\r\ncorresponded with his modesty of disposition and the delicacy of his\r\nfeelings.[311] He possessed a good share of constitutional firmness of\r\nmind; and was seldom either much or long depressed, by such misfortunes\r\nor afflictions as bore chiefly upon himself: still, however, the great\r\nbenevolence of his temper rendered him extremely sensible to the\r\nsufferings of others. The bodily infirmities of such as came within his\r\nmore immediate notice, and the privations occasioned by helpless\r\nindigence, more especially of aged persons, often experienced in him a\r\nconsoling friend and a liberal benefactor; provided they appeared to be\r\nobjects worthy of charitable assistance. But where the sufferings or\r\nwants of others evidently resulted either from confirmed inebriety or\r\nother vicious habits, or from indolence or censurable improvidence, he\r\nwas not accustomed to extend the hand of charitable bounty with the same\r\ncordiality. His means of affording pecuniary assistance to such of his\r\nfellow-men as needed it, were circumscribed by bounds of moderate\r\nextent: yet, in proportion to his resources, his acts of charity were\r\nlaudable in their degree, as well as in regard to the objects of his\r\nbenevolence, and entirely destitute of ostentation: they were dictated\r\nboth by the humanity of his heart and a sense of moral duty.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 311:\r\n\r\n  “His manners were civil and engaging, to such a degree, that he seldom\r\n  passed an hour, even in a public house in travelling through our\r\n  country, without being followed by the good wishes of all who attended\r\n  upon him.” Rush’s _Eulogium_ on Ritt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the predominating mildness of his disposition, he was\r\ncapable of being roused on some occasions, to pretty strong emotions of\r\nindignation; and nothing would excite these feelings in his mind more\r\nreadily, or in a higher degree, than instances of great cruelty,\r\noppression or injustice, whether of a public or private nature.[312]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 312:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse’s brother Benjamin, in a written communication made to\r\n  the writer of these memoirs in the year 1796, observes, that the\r\n  Doctor, “when in health, was cheerful; and his passions, unless they\r\n  were excited by the abuses and knavery of men, either in public or\r\n  private life, were moderate: but where he conceived that the interest\r\n  or liberties of his country were endangered, he would, on those\r\n  occasions, express himself with great warmth and asperity.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHis long continued habits of contemplation and study, and his seclusion\r\nfrom the busy world until the full meridian of life, created in his mind\r\na fondness for tranquillity. This disposition, co-operating with his\r\nhumanity and love of justice, made him a friend to peace; insomuch, that\r\nhe deprecated a state of warfare, even in cases attended by colourable\r\npretexts of right and expediency, for engaging in it. Hence, he could\r\nnot refrain from attaching to the late warlike Sovereign of Prussia,\r\n“the mighty Frederick,” the appellation of “Tyrant of the North and\r\nScourge of Mankind;”[313] believing, as he did, that this monarch was\r\nmore influenced by an unfeeling personal ambition and thirst of military\r\nfame, than either by the justness of his cause or a desire to promote\r\nthe happiness of his subjects.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  See his _Oration_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWith such feelings and such views of the subject as these, our\r\nPhilosopher could not consider that as a justifiable cause of war,\r\nwhich has not for its object, either the defence of a country against\r\nan hostile invader, or the security of the state and the support of\r\nthe liberties of the people, against treasonable domestic\r\ninsurrections.[314]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 314:\r\n\r\n  It was publicly declared by the same acrimonious writer who charged\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse with being an atheist, (namely, Mr. William Cobbett,)\r\n  and with an equal disregard of truth, as has been already shewn, that\r\n  the Doctor signed “the inflammatory Resolutions” of the Democratic\r\n  Society against the Excise-law, which, as he alleged, produced the\r\n  Western Insurrection in Pennsylvania, in the year 1794. Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse, it is well known, did not even attend the meetings of\r\n  that society. This is admitted by Mr. Cobbett himself, in the\r\n  following invidious paragraph, extracted from a pamphlet written and\r\n  published by the late William L. Smith, Esq. of South-Carolina, and\r\n  republished by Cobbett in his own works: it is in these\r\n  words—“Rittenhouse was a great philosopher; but the only proof we have\r\n  had of his political talents, was, his suffering himself to be\r\n  wheedled into the presidency of the democratic society of\r\n  Philadelphia; a society with which he was even ashamed to associate,\r\n  though cajoled and flattered into the loan of his name.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHis habits and manners were such as comported with the honest sincerity\r\nof his heart, the amiable simplicity of his whole character,[315] and\r\nthe nature of his pursuits in life. He loved quiet and order, and\r\npreferred retirement to the bustle of the world: and these dispositions\r\nendeared to him the comforts of domestic society. He considered\r\nambition, pomp and ostentation, as being generally inconsistent with\r\ntrue happiness. His sentiments respecting luxury are expressed in very\r\nenergetic language, in his Oration: he viewed it as the constant\r\nforerunner of tyranny; and both, as being, eventually, the means of\r\ndestroying useful science, though professing to be its friends. Yet he\r\nwas far from being inimical to that mutual “exchange of benefits,”[316]\r\nwhich is effected by means of foreign commerce; or to those intercourses\r\nof society, which augment our rational enjoyments: he was, in truth, a\r\nfriend to beneficial trade, and approved of those “social refinements,\r\nwhich really add to our happiness, and induce us with gratitude to\r\nacknowledge our great Creator’s goodness.”[317] But he justly\r\ndistinguished between that sort of commerce with foreign nations, that\r\nconduces to the well-being of mankind, and such as is obviously immoral\r\nin itself, or deleterious in its consequences. Of both these latter\r\ndescriptions, he considered the slave-trade; a traffic, against which he\r\nbore his testimony more than thirty-seven years ago: and, as Dr. Rush\r\nhas emphatically observed in respect to what he had advanced in favour\r\nof Christianity, “the single testimony of David Rittenhouse,” on the the\r\none side, “outweighs the declamations of whole nations,” on the other.\r\nCommerce of an injurious nature, he viewed to be such as ministers more\r\nto the debauching luxuries of mankind, than to their necessities,\r\nconveniencies and substantial comforts.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 315:\r\n\r\n  The memorialist cannot deprive himself of the gratification of\r\n  introducing, on the present occasion, a little anecdote communicated\r\n  to him by his friend, Francis Johnston, Esq. characteristic of our\r\n  philosopher’s amiable simplicity and benevolent disposition.\r\n  Circumstances as unimportant in themselves, as the one here related,\r\n  sometimes make us acquainted with the true character of individuals.\r\n\r\n  Colonel Johnston, who was bred a scholar, and held with reputation the\r\n  rank of a colonel in the American service in the war of the\r\n  revolution, was, at an early period of his life, a zealous admirer of\r\n  the character of Rittenhouse. But long afterwards, and while the\r\n  Doctor officiated as state-treasurer, that gentleman held the next\r\n  great office in the financial department of the state. The connexion\r\n  of those offices occasioned almost daily visits from the colonel to\r\n  the state-treasury, and intercourse with the treasurer himself; and\r\n  this produced a reciprocal friendship between the two gentlemen. “For\r\n  a time,” says Col. Johnston, “Dr. Rittenhouse managed the business of\r\n  his office with the utmost attention and assiduity: but his\r\n  all-capacious mind could no longer be restrained from its native\r\n  pursuits; his money and his counter, therefore, he resigned into the\r\n  hands of his beloved wife, who, although possessed of all the feminine\r\n  virtues, performed the arduous duties of the office with a masculine\r\n  understanding, with accuracy and unwearied attention.”\r\n\r\n  “My intimacy with Dr. Rittenhouse,” continues the colonel, “introduced\r\n  between us a concern in some property, in the western part of the\r\n  city, which often induced us to walk out together, to visit it. That\r\n  part of the property which laid on the main street, belonged to me;\r\n  and being more exposed to the depredations of the disorderly people\r\n  who then inhabited that neighbourhood, was consequently often injured\r\n  in the fences or board-inclosures. More than once, I have seen this\r\n  philosopher, who never thought it any degradation of philosophy, to\r\n  bow at the shrine of friendship, marching along my line of fence, and\r\n  most industriously, and in a most masterly manner, with his own hammer\r\n  and nails, mending or repairing the same.”\r\n\r\n  “This anecdote I mention thus particularly,” adds the worthy colonel,\r\n  “with a view of shewing, that in addition to Dr. Rittenhouse’s other\r\n  virtues, humanity and friendship were leading traits in his excellent\r\n  character.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 316:\r\n\r\n  In expressing his admiration of “that dispositions of lands and seas,\r\n  which affords a communication between distant regions, and a mutual\r\n  exchange of benefits,” Dr. Rittenhouse unquestionably had in view a\r\n  commercial, as well as social, intercourse between the inhabitants of\r\n  different climes: he was too enlightened a man, not to have been aware\r\n  of its “benefits.” “A civilized nation, without commerce,” (as the\r\n  writer of these memoirs had occasion to observe in a former\r\n  publication,[316a]) “is a solecism in politics. It is in the rudest\r\n  state of mankind, only, that a people can exist, without any\r\n  communication with other societies or commercial intercourse among\r\n  themselves, every one supporting himself by his own labour. Indeed, so\r\n  absolute a state of nature can only be conceived; but has scarcely\r\n  existed in reality. The wants, the fears, the weakness, nay the very\r\n  nature of man, constitute him a social animal: and, in the very origin\r\n  of society, their mutual necessities, with the various talents, means,\r\n  and opportunities of individuals for supporting them, must have\r\n  produced a reciprocity of services, and an occasional interchange with\r\n  one another of that property, which each had acquired by his own\r\n  exertions.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 316a:\r\n\r\n  The true interest of the United States, and particularly of\r\n  Pennsylvania, considered: published in 1786.\r\n\r\nFootnote 317:\r\n\r\n  See his Oration.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNo man had less of “the gloomy spirit of misanthropy,” than Dr.\r\nRittenhouse: his whole life evinced, “with what ardour,” to use his own\r\nwords, “he wished for the happiness of the whole race of mankind.” And,\r\nthat he detested penuriousness, the contemptuous manner in which he has\r\ntreated the character of the miser, in his Oration, is sufficient to\r\ntestify. A manly spirit of independence, on the one hand, and a\r\ndisposition, on the other, to partake rationally of what are called the\r\ngood things of the world, induced him to pursue, in his style of living,\r\na middle course, between extreme parsimony and a prodigality equally\r\ncensurable. He was therefore, an economist. “His economy,” as Dr. Rush\r\nhas justly remarked, even “extended to a wise and profitable use of his\r\ntime:” for he was, when most in health, an early riser; and devoted much\r\nof his time to reading and other studies, when not otherwise engaged or\r\nusefully employed. So inestimable did our Philosopher deem this gift of\r\nheaven to man, that, says his Eulogist, he observed on a certain\r\noccasion, “that he once thought health the greatest blessing in the\r\nworld, but he now thought there was one thing of much greater value, and\r\nthat was time.”[318]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  In the year 1756, he made an eight-day clock, for his brother-in-law,\r\n  Mr. Barton; over the dial-plate of which, was engraven this mementory\r\n  motto—_Tempus fugit_; and underneath, this blunt but too often\r\n  necessary precept—_Go about your business_.\r\n\r\n  On one description of the continental bills of credit, issued by\r\n  congress during the American war, were represented a sundial and a\r\n  meridian sun over it: above, the word “Fugio;” and beneath, these\r\n  words—“Mind your Business.” And on the reverse of a copper one cent\r\n  piece, struck in the year 1787, in pursuance of a resolve of congress\r\n  of the 6th of July in that year, are impressed the same device and\r\n  mottoes as those last mentioned; corresponding with those adopted by\r\n  our Philosopher, when only twenty-four years of age: a circumstance\r\n  that shews, how early in life he had formed a just estimate of the\r\n  value of time.\r\n\r\n  It may not be improper here to observe, that the various devices\r\n  affixed to the continental money, as it was called, were much admired\r\n  for their appropriate significancy; and that they were generally\r\n  supposed to be the production of the late ingenious Judge Hopkinson,\r\n  an intimate friend of Mr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThough rather plain and simple than otherwise, in all his domestic\r\narrangements, he lived well,—in the common acceptation of the phrase.\r\nNor was he in any respect deficient in that decorum in his personal\r\nappearance, and in the modest appendages of his household, which\r\ncorresponded with his character and station in society. There was not\r\nthe least affectation of any thing like parade or splendour, in his\r\nmanner of living. In his dress he was remarkably neat, correct and\r\ngentlemanlike: his house, with its furniture were of a corresponding\r\nstyle of propriety; the mansion itself, with every thing appurtenant to\r\nit, seemed to denote its being the residence of good sense, elegant\r\nsimplicity, and genuine comfort.\r\n\r\nNeither the delicate state of his constitution, nor his almost unceasing\r\nemployment, either in business or study, when enjoying his ordinary\r\nportion of health, permitted Dr. Rittenhouse to participate in the\r\nsociety of his friends, at his table, in that manner which an hospitable\r\ndisposition and a desire to mingle in the conversation of estimable men,\r\nled him to wish. Yet he occasionally had a very few friends to dine with\r\nhim; and on those occasions, he avoided every thing that could bear the\r\nleast appearance of ostentation. He received, however, frequent visits\r\nin the evening, from persons whom he respected and esteemed,—at the time\r\nof taking tea, a beverage which was very grateful to him. It was on such\r\noccasions, more particularly, that he would unbend; he would then bear\r\nhis part in reciprocations of amusement, as well as instruction, with\r\ngreat good humour, sometimes even pleasantry, if he were tolerably well.\r\n“As a companion,” says Dr. Rush, “he instructed upon all subjects:” an\r\nobservation, of which the Writer of these Memoirs has, indeed, very\r\noften experienced the correctness; and there have been few men, perhaps,\r\nwho ever had an opportunity of knowing his communicative disposition,\r\nfrom a personal acquaintance with him, that have not been either\r\ngratified or improved by his conversations.\r\n\r\nBut the same causes that prevented his seeing his friends, beyond the\r\ncircle of his family-connections, at his own table, as often as the\r\nsociability of his temper must have prompted him to do, imposed on him\r\nthe necessity of very frequently declining the acceptance of invitations\r\nfrom others; more especially, for large dining parties, and companies of\r\nformal visitors: his habits of great temperance, a dislike of much\r\nceremoniousness, and an economical disposition of his time, were further\r\ninducements to his declining, very generally, such invitations.\r\n\r\nIn domestic life his whole conduct was perfectly exemplary. No man was\r\never a better husband or father, or a more indulgent master; nor was\r\nthere ever a kinder relative. He educated his children very liberally;\r\nand in the society of these, together with his wife, a woman of\r\nexcellent understanding, he enjoyed in an high degree, and for some\r\nyears, the delights of a rational and endearing intercourse. In this\r\nlittle family-society, he experienced a large portion of domestic\r\nhappiness, no otherwise alloyed than by the bodily sufferings he\r\noccasionally endured. And, as Dr. Rush observes,[319]—“when the\r\ndeclining state of his health rendered the solitude of his study less\r\nagreeable than in former years, he passed whole evenings in reading or\r\nconversing, with his wife and daughters.”—“Happy family!” exclaims his\r\nEulogist, “so much and so long blessed with such a head!—and happier\r\nstill, to have possessed dispositions and knowledge to discern and love\r\nhis exalted character, and to enjoy his instructing conversation!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\n  See Eulog. on Ritt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn his friendship, as in all his social affections, he was perfectly\r\nsincere; for, his ardent love of truth led him to detest every species\r\nof dissimulation. He was warmly attached to many estimable characters,\r\namong those with whom he was acquainted; and he enjoyed, in return,\r\ntheir friendship and respect: besides which, he possessed in an high\r\ndegree the esteem of all his fellow-citizens, to whom his name and\r\ncharacter were well known. With not a few persons, who were either\r\ndistinguished by literature and science, or by ingenuity, and\r\ninformation on general topics or particular subjects of useful\r\nknowledge, he was in habits of intimacy: in the list of these, might be\r\nplaced several of the most eminent and dignified characters in America.\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse’s epistolary correspondence, even with his personal\r\nfriends, was by no means extensive: indeed the most of these, after his\r\nremoval to Philadelphia, were there his fellow-citizens. His almost\r\nincessant employment, either in public or private business, occupied his\r\ntime so fully as to allow him little leisure, when in the enjoyment of\r\nhealth; and sensible of the repeated inroads which the privation of this\r\nblessing made on his profitable time, he was covetous of every hour, in\r\nwhich his industry could be most conveniently as well us usefully\r\nengaged. He therefore, like the celebrated Dr. Bradley,[320] published\r\nlittle. Possibly, too, this circumstance in relation to both these great\r\nastronomers, may have been, in some degree, occasioned by similar\r\nmotives, a natural diffidence in their own faculties, extraordinary as\r\nothers knew them to be. The English philosopher is even said to have\r\nbeen apprehensive, that a publication of his works might prove injurious\r\nto his reputation; and, therefore, he suppressed many of his papers: but\r\nwhether our astronomer made preparations for publishing any large\r\nsystematic work, in his favourite science, cannot be ascertained; the\r\nprobability however is, that he did not, for want of time and health to\r\nengage in such an undertaking.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\n  An eulogy of this great astronomer, celebrated for his discovery of\r\n  the aberration and nutation, will be found in the History of the\r\n  French Academy, for the year 1762. He was born in 1692; and died at\r\n  Greenwich, in 1762, at the age of seventy years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThat the world possess so few of Dr. Rittenhouse’s philosophical papers,\r\nis a matter truly to be regretted: because records extensively\r\npromulgated, of the results of his numerous and laborious researches,\r\nconcerning the most sublime and interesting operations of nature, would,\r\nbeyond any doubt, have greatly added to the stock of human knowledge.\r\nAnd this regret is enhanced by the reflexion, that if the government of\r\nPennsylvania could have conveniently pursued the plan proposed to them\r\nby the Philosophical Society, in the year 1775;[321] or, had that or\r\nsome such measure been adopted eight or ten years afterward, when the\r\nrevolutionary war interposed no impediment to an important public\r\narrangement of that nature; the world would, in all probability, at this\r\nday be in the possession of many additional productions of his vastly\r\ncomprehensive genius. His astronomical discoveries and other fruits of\r\nhis prolific mind, recorded by his pen, would in such case, it may be\r\nreasonably presumed, have redounded to the honour of his country and the\r\nbenefit of mankind. But, that an American citizen of slender fortune,\r\none who was (to use the strongly expressive terms of the Philosophical\r\nSociety, on the occasion just mentioned,) “indebted for bread to his\r\ndaily toil,”—that a man, thus circumstanced, could be expected to\r\ncontribute a large portion of his inestimable time, wholly unrewarded,\r\neither to the public interests or the acquisition of personal fame,\r\nwould be an impeachment of his prudence. Dr. Rittenhouse was not\r\ngratuitously furnished with a complete Observatory and Astronomical\r\napparatus;[322] nor, besides, recompensed by a liberal compensation from\r\nthe public purse; in order that he might be enabled to devote himself to\r\nthe public service, in scientific pursuits: Flamstead, Halley, Bliss,\r\nBradley and Maskelyne, were so rewarded. Each of these eminent\r\nastronomers held, at different periods, the lucrative and honourable\r\nplace of Regius Professor, or Astronomer Royal, at Greenwich.[323]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\n  See the Memorial of the Society to the General Assembly, dated the 6th\r\n  of March, 1775; introduced in the foregoing pages.\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  Observatories are indispensably necessary to the cultivation of\r\n  astronomical science. There are many celebrated institutions of this\r\n  kind, in various parts of Europe; and of these, the British isles may\r\n  justly boast of possessing a large proportion in number, admirably\r\n  fitted up with all the necessary apparatus. Some account of these will\r\n  be found in other parts of this work.\r\n\r\n  Besides the liberal and honourable provision made for eminent\r\n  astronomers in Great-Britain, many of the most distinguished men of\r\n  the same class, on the continent of Europe, have experienced the\r\n  bounty of their respective princes and states. Such, among others,\r\n  were the celebrated C. Mayer, Astronomer to the Elector Palatine and\r\n  duke of Bavaria, at Manheim; Zach, Astronomer to the Duke of\r\n  Saxe-Gotha, at Gotha; and Lalande, Professor of Astronomy and\r\n  Inspector of the College of France, at Paris. These great philosophers\r\n  have had splendid astronomical establishments provided for them, by\r\n  their sovereigns; as is more particularly noticed in other parts of\r\n  these memoirs. And the extensive work of Mr. de Zach, entitled,\r\n  _Tabulæ Motuum Solis novæ et correctæ_, &c. (a large quarto volume in\r\n  the Latin language,) was printed under the patronage and at the\r\n  expense of the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, in the year 1792, and distributed\r\n  gratis among many of the learned of the old and new world; an example\r\n  of munificence worthy of imitation by all sovereign princes and\r\n  states, who know how to estimate, as they deserve, such importantly\r\n  useful productions of men eminent in science.\r\n\r\n  The time, in which the transcendent talents of such philosophers as\r\n  have been here named, was employed, together with the products of\r\n  their labours, were rightfully, under such patronage, the property of\r\n  the public; while the time of our astronomer was with equal justice\r\n  his own, and consequently the fruits of his time, genius, and labour,\r\n  were, at least primarily, due to himself and his family.\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  The famous English Observatory near Greenwich Hospital, and in the\r\n  immediate vicinity of the town of Greenwich in Kent, (erected, on a\r\n  commanding eminence one hundred and sixty feet above the level of the\r\n  river Thames, in the year 1676, by order of King Charles II.) is still\r\n  called Flamstead-House; Mr. Flamstead having been the first person\r\n  appointed Regius Professor there.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Dr. Rittenhouse’s published writings are, for the\r\nreasons that have been assigned, not very extensive, his philosophical\r\npublications on various subjects, chiefly astronomical, are far from\r\nbeing inconsiderable in number; and some of them are highly important,\r\nwhile others discover the activity and force of his genius.[324] The\r\nfollowing is a list of his papers communicated to the Am. Philosophical\r\nSociety, and published in their Transactions; arranged according to the\r\ndates at which they were severally read in the Society: viz.\r\n\r\n1. The first volume, printed in the year 1771,[325] contains—“A\r\nDescription of a new Orrery; planned, and now nearly finished, by David\r\nRittenhouse, A. M. of Norriton, in the county of Philadelphia:”\r\ncommunicated by Dr. Smith. Read, March 21. 1768.\r\n\r\n2. “Calculation of the Transit of Venus over the Sun, as it is to\r\nhappen, June 3d 1769, in Lat. 40° N. Long. 5^h. W. from Greenwich:”\r\ncommunicated 21st of June, 1768.\r\n\r\n3. An Account of the Transit of Mercury over the Sun, Nov. 9. 1769, as\r\nobserved at Norriton, in Pennsylvania, by Dr. Smith, and Messrs. Lukens,\r\nRittenhouse, and O. Biddle, the committee appointed for that purpose by\r\nthe Am. Philos. Society: drawn up and communicated, by direction and in\r\nbehalf of the committee, by Dr. Smith—July 20. 1769.\r\n\r\n4. Observations on the Comet of June and July, 1770; with the elements\r\nof its motion and the trajectory of its path; in two letters from David\r\nRittenhouse, M. A. to William Smith, D. D. Prov. Coll. Philad.[326]\r\nCommunicated, Aug. 3. 1770.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  It is said of the celebrated Roger Cotes, by his friend and patron,\r\n  the learned Dr. Richard Bentley, in his inscription upon the tomb of\r\n  that great philosopher, at Cambridge, that—\r\n\r\n               “_Pauca quidem Ingenii sui pignora reliquit,\r\n                Sed egregia, sed admiranda_:”\r\n\r\n  In like manner, though the writings of Dr. Rittenhouse are neither\r\n  numerous nor extensive, some of his works are, nevertheless, so\r\n  excellent and admirable in their nature, they exhibit such proofs of\r\n  transcendent genius, that they will immortalize his name. And, as\r\n  Cotes was prematurely taken away by death, or, as expressed in his\r\n  epitaph,\r\n\r\n                      “_Immaturâ Morte præreptus_;”—\r\n\r\n  so, the actual term of Rittenhouse’s life may be considered as having\r\n  been much shortened by sickness. Franklin, who lived twenty years\r\n  longer than our astronomer, published little in philosophy; yet this\r\n  circumstance does not derogate from his claims to the character of a\r\n  philosopher.\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  A second edition of the first volume was published in the year 1789,\r\n  in consequence of the extraordinary demand for that book, by reason of\r\n  the very important papers respecting the Transit of Venus, contained\r\n  in it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  Some further remarks respecting this comet, than those contained in\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse’s communication, here referred to, will be found in an\r\n  extract which has already been given, of his letter to the Rev. Mr.\r\n  Barton, under the date of July 30, 1770.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n5. An easy method of deducing the True Time of the Sun’s passing the\r\nMeridian, per clock, from a comparison of four equal altitudes, observed\r\non two succeeding days; by David Rittenhouse, A. M.[327] Communicated by\r\nWilliam Smith, D. D. Prov. Coll. Philad.—Aug. 17. 1770.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Francis de Zach (Astronomer to the duke of Saxe-Gotha,) in the\r\n  explanation and use of his table, No. 38, entitled, “Correctio horæ\r\n  meridianæ prodeuntis ex altitudinibus correspondentibus Solis,”\r\n  says—“Tradit Clarissimus DAV. RITTENHOUSE, in Transactionibus\r\n  Americanis (vol. 1. p. 155. edit. 2.), Methodum novum correctionis\r\n  horæ meridianæ, absque tabulis, ex solâ observatione deducendæ; sed\r\n  requiruntur, ad hoc, duorum dierum subsequentium altitudines quatuor\r\n  æquales: id est, sub eadem altitudine manè et vesperi factæ, ad\r\n  assequendam ex his, correctiones meridiei, Regulæ Clariss. Authoris\r\n  sunt sequentes:” Mr. de Zach then lays down Dr. Rittenhouse’s Rules,\r\n  which will be found in the Transactions of the American Philosophical\r\n  Society, already referred to; and adds—“Exempla hoc perspicuum\r\n  reddent:” he next states two examples, from which he deduces proofs of\r\n  the accuracy of Dr. Rittenhouse’s method. See “_Tabulæ Motuum Solis,\r\n  novæ et correctæ, ex Theoriâ Gravitatis et Observationibus\r\n  recentissimis erutæ, &c. auctore Francisco de Zach_:” printed at\r\n  Gotha, in 1792.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n6. Account of the Terrestrial Measurement of the difference of Longitude\r\nbetween the Observatories of Norriton and Philadelphia; drawn up by the\r\nRev.

Read, May 2. 1783. (N. B. Mr.\r\nRittenhouse’s letter is dated Jan. 16. 1780.)\r\n\r\n10. Observations on a Comet lately discovered; communicated by David\r\nRittenhouse, Esq.[328] Read, March 19. 1784.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  This Comet was observed by John Lukens, Esq. of Philadelphia, on the\r\n  20th of January, 1784. This respectable practical astronomer\r\n  communicated his discovery of it to Dr. Rittenhouse the next day, on\r\n  the evening of which, (“assisted by Mr. Lukens and Mr. Prior,”) he\r\n  ascertained the then apparent place of this comet. Dr. Rittenhouse’s\r\n  communication to the society, on this subject, gives also the apparent\r\n  place of the comet on the 17th of February, being the last time the\r\n  weather permitted him to see it: the result of his intermediate\r\n  observations is also stated.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n11.

Astronomical Observations; communicated by Mr. Rittenhouse. Without\r\ndate.[329]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  These observations were made in Philadelphia, by Dr. Rittenhouse, at\r\n  sundry times in the years 1784, 1785, and 1786, on the new planet, or\r\n  Georgium Sidus; and on the Transit of Mercury over the Sun’s disk, on\r\n  the 12th of November, 1782. The same communication also states the\r\n  geocentric places of the Georgium Sidus, at several different dates\r\n  between the 1st of April, 1762, and the 14th of March, 1784, both\r\n  included; as observed by Mr. James Six, at the city of Canterbury in\r\n  England.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n14. The third volume, printed in the year 1793, contains—An Account of\r\nseveral Houses, in Philadelphia, struck with Lightning on the 7th of\r\nJune, 1789; by Mr. D. Rittenhouse and Dr. John Jones.

Dr. Madison; and of the second, alone, made at\r\nWashington-College in Maryland, by the Rev. Dr. Smith: communicated by\r\nD. Rittenhouse. Read, February 4. 1791.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  This eclipse was observed by Andrew Ellicott, Esq. at the city of\r\n  Washington, as follows; viz.\r\n\r\n             {  6.^h 39′.  1″,25  }  Annulus completed    }\r\n  April 3d.  {  6.   43.   15,25  }    Do.   broken       }  M.

A Letter from Dr. Rittenhouse to Mr. Patterson, relative to a Method\r\nof finding the Sum of the several Powers of the Sines, &c. Read, May 18.\r\n1792.\r\n\r\n18. An Account of a Comet, (first observed by Mr. Rittenhouse, on the\r\n11th of January, 1793:) in a letter from D. Rittenhouse to Mr.\r\nPatterson.[331] Read, February 15. 1793.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n  In this letter, Dr. Rittenhouse merely informs Mr. Patterson, in\r\n  general terms, of the time when he first observed this comet, its then\r\n  place, and its course through several of the constellations, until the\r\n  8th of February; on the evening of which day, he saw it for the last\r\n  time. It is presumed that Dr. Rittenhouse’s state of health, at that\r\n  period, would not admit of his making more definite observations on\r\n  this comet.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe fourth volume, printed in the year 1799, (three years after Dr.\r\nRittenhouse’s death,) contains—\r\n\r\n19. A paper, “On the Improvement of Time-keepers;” by David Rittenhouse,\r\nLL. D. Pres. Am. Philos. Society. Read, November 7. 1794.[332]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\n  This _desideratum_ in astronomical science had long engaged Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse’s attention; and it is confidently said by one of his\r\n  intimate friends, that, in the latter part of his life, he had\r\n  actually written much on the subject of Pendulums; intended, probably,\r\n  for publication. But, unfortunately, the manuscript-book, which\r\n  contained what he had thus written, can not now be found.\r\n\r\n  In the paper mentioned in the text, he remarks, that “the invention\r\n  and construction of time-keepers may be reckoned among the most\r\n  successful exertions of human genius. Pendulum-clocks especially,”\r\n  says he, “have been made to measure time with astonishing accuracy;\r\n  and, if there are still some causes of inequality in their motions,\r\n  the united efforts of mechanism, philosophy and mathematics, will\r\n  probably, in time, remove them.”\r\n\r\n  Indeed no man has done more, none perhaps so much, towards removing\r\n  the imperfections in chronometers, to which he alludes, as this great\r\n  mechanician himself. His admirable time-piece, now in the possession\r\n  of the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, constructed by him, on\r\n  an improved plan of his own, affords ample proof of the “astonishing\r\n  accuracy” (as he expresses it) to which the pendulum-chronometer may\r\n  be brought. A description of the mechanism of this extremely accurate\r\n  time-piece, as well as of the principles on which its superior\r\n  correctness depends, is inserted in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n20. A paper, “On the Expansion of Wood by Heat;” in a letter from David\r\nRittenhouse, LL. D. Pres. Am. Philos. Society. Dated, May 15. 1795.\r\n\r\n21. A Method of raising the common Logarithm of any number immediately;\r\nby D. Rittenhouse, LL. D. Pres. Am. Philos. Society. Read, August 12.\r\n1795.\r\n\r\n22. A communication, “On the Mode of determining the true Place of a\r\nPlanet, in an eliptical Orbit, directly from the mean Anomaly by\r\nConverging Series;” by David Rittenhouse, Pres. Am. Phil. Society. Read,\r\nFebruary 5. 1796.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\nThis last communication was made to the Society, within five months of\r\nthe time immediately preceding Dr. Rittenhouse’s death.\r\n\r\nIt is a strong evidence not only of our Philosopher’s industry, but of\r\nhis attachment to that institution of which he was so great an ornament,\r\nthat, in the course of the twenty-six years during which he was a member\r\nof it, he could find sufficient leisure,—almost constantly employed, as\r\nhe was, in important public business, and frequently bereft of\r\nhealth,—to contribute so many valuable papers as he did, to the too\r\nscanty stock of its published Transactions. Dr. Franklin, who was a\r\nmember of the Philosophical Society, and their president, for twenty-one\r\nyears, furnished them with only eight communications during that time:\r\nand Mr. Jefferson, who has nominally occupied the president’s chair[333]\r\nin the same Society above sixteen years, has favoured them with only two\r\nor three, within this period.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n  The appropriate location of “The American Philosophical Society” is\r\n  the city of “Philadelphia,” where their meetings must be held in\r\n  conformity to their charter. Monticello, Mr. Jefferson’s residence in\r\n  Virginia, is situated at the distance of about two hundred and seventy\r\n  miles from the capital of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHad Dr. Rittenhouse enjoyed leisure to write, there are sufficient\r\nreasons to induce a belief, that his compositions would have been highly\r\nestimable; not solely for the subject matter of them, but for their\r\nmanner also. It is true, he laboured under the privations of a liberal\r\neducation: his style might therefore, perhaps, have been deficient in\r\nsome of the ornamental appendages of classical learning. Nevertheless,\r\nthe native energy of his mind, the clearness of his perceptions, the\r\naccuracy with which he employed his reasoning faculties,—in fine, the\r\nvery extraordinary intellectual powers he displayed, when they were\r\ndirected to the attainment of any species of human knowledge;—these\r\nwould, doubtless, have supplied him with those beauties of language,\r\nwhich are usually, as well as most readily, derived from academic\r\ninstruction. And in addition to all these, the sublimity of the objects\r\nwhich he so ardently and frequently contemplated, could scarcely fail to\r\nhave communicated to his literary productions a due portion of an\r\nelevated style, when treating on subjects of a corresponding character.\r\nDr. Rush, in noticing the address delivered by Rittenhouse before the\r\nPhilosophical Society in the year 1775, observes, that “the language of\r\nthis Oration is simple, but” that “the sentiments contained in it are\r\ningenious, original, and in some instances sublime:” in another place,\r\nthe learned Eulogist styles it an “eloquent performance.” It is\r\npresumed, that these characteristic features of that little work are not\r\nunaptly applied; and it will be found, on perusal, to be also strongly\r\ntinctured, throughout, with a vein of exalted piety[334] and universal\r\nbenevolence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  It is difficult for a sound and contemplative mind to form any\r\n  conception of the character of a philosopher, according to the true\r\n  meaning of the term, more especially of an astronomer, of a man\r\n  observant of the works of nature and acquainted with her laws; and yet\r\n  wanting in a due sense of religion. And hence Dr. Young has declared,\r\n  that—\r\n\r\n                    “An undevout Philosopher is mad.”\r\n\r\n  Instances, however, of this kind of mania, are known to have existed;\r\n  produced by that presumptuous pride, which is too often engendered by\r\n  a sophistication of true philosophy with the wild fantasies of some\r\n  modern metaphysical sects, affecting extraordinary illumination. By\r\n  thus engrafting a bad scion upon a good stock, pernicious fruit is\r\n  propagated: or, to drop metaphorical allusions, by attempting to blend\r\n  into one system, principles so discordant in their nature, as those of\r\n  the experimental philosopher and the visionary theorist who deals in\r\n  abstract speculations and reasonings _â priori_, the appropriate\r\n  powers of the mind are weakened, while its moral faculty is at the\r\n  same time, and by the same means, greatly deteriorated.\r\n\r\n  An extraordinary but deplorable instance of this kind was exhibited to\r\n  the world by the justly celebrated astronomer Lalande, in his own\r\n  conduct and character, towards the concluding part of a long life.\r\n  These are so well portrayed in the very interesting _Letters on France\r\n  and England_, published in _The American Review of History and\r\n  Politicks_, that the writer of the present memoirs cannot forbear\r\n  presenting to his reader the following extract from Letter III.\r\n\r\n  “Lalande, if not the most profound and original, was certainly the\r\n  most learned astronomer of France, and the principal benefactor of the\r\n  science to which he was so passionately devoted. He was remarkable for\r\n  the most egregious vanity, and for the broadest eccentricities of\r\n  character, and almost equally eminent for the most noble virtues of\r\n  the heart. By a very singular perversion of intellect, he became a\r\n  professed atheist, about the commencement of the revolution;\r\n  pronounced, in the year 1793, in the Pantheon, a discourse against the\r\n  existence of a God, with the red cap upon his head; and displayed, on\r\n  this subject, the most absolute insanity, during the rest of his life.\r\n  This monstrous infatuation betrayed him into the most whimsical acts\r\n  of extravagance, and particularly into the publication of a Dictionary\r\n  of Atheists, in which he enregistered not only many of “the\r\n  illustrious dead,” but a great number of his cotemporaries, and among\r\n  these, some of the principal dignitaries of the empire.\r\n\r\n  “This circumstance led to an occurrence in the Institute, which that\r\n  body will not soon forget. At an extraordinary sitting of all the\r\n  classes, convoked for the purpose, when Lalande was present, a letter\r\n  from the Emperor was announced and read aloud, in which it was\r\n  declared, that Mr. Lalande had fallen into a state of dotage, and was\r\n  forbidden to publish, thereafter, any thing under his own name. The\r\n  old astronomer rose very solemnly, bowed low, and replied, that he\r\n  would certainly obey the orders of his majesty. His atheistical\r\n  absurdities deserved, no doubt, to be repressed; but, besides the\r\n  singularity of this form of interdiction, there was an unnecessary\r\n  degree of severity in it, as the end might have been attained without\r\n  so public a humiliation. Lalande was notoriously superannuated, and\r\n  not therefore a fit object for this species of punishment. Some\r\n  consideration, moreover, was due to his many private virtues, to his\r\n  rank in the scientific world, and to the large additions which he had\r\n  made to the stock of human knowledge. His atheistical opinions arose,\r\n  not from any moral depravity, but from a positive alienation of mind\r\n  on religious topics. He was not the less conspicuous for the most\r\n  disinterested generosity; for warm feelings of humanity; for the\r\n  gentleness of his manners; for the soundness of his opinions on\r\n  questions of science, and for a certain magnanimity with regard to the\r\n  merits of his rivals and detractors. The extravagance of his opinions\r\n  and his manners during his dotage, rendered him an object of almost\r\n  universal derision in Paris, and subjected him to the most cruel and\r\n  indecent mockery. It became fashionable, even among those who had\r\n  derived their knowledge from his lessons and experienced his bounty,\r\n  to depreciate his merits both as an astronomer and as a man. Lalande\r\n  had the misfortune of living to see a maxim verified in his own\r\n  regard, which has been exemplified in every age and country, that some\r\n  disciples may become superiour to their masters. But he was,\r\n  nevertheless, at all times among the luminaries of science; and to him\r\n  astronomy was indebted for more substantial and unremitted services,\r\n  than to any one of his cotemporaries.”\r\n\r\n  This very Mr. Lalande, in the preface to the third edition of his\r\n  inestimable work entitled _Astronomie_, published at Paris so late as\r\n  the year 1792, shews, that astronomy furnishes most powerful proofs of\r\n  the being of a God. Yet this same man, in one year after, when in his\r\n  “dotage,” with a mind enfeebled by age, and corrupted by the delusions\r\n  of the new philosophy of his countrymen, became an object of\r\n  “derision,” and of “mockery,” even among Frenchmen; for his\r\n  absurdities, and his endeavours to set himself up as a champion of\r\n  atheism! Is it necessary to furnish the rational part of mankind with\r\n  a more striking, and at the same time a more lamentable proof, of the\r\n  deleterious effects produced by those illusions, which, under the\r\n  assumed name of “Philosophy,” have been conjured up by some modern\r\n  Theorists and Political Speculators? Certainly, it is not. The\r\n  instance, here adduced, may stand as a monument of the folly and\r\n  depravity of the Philosophy of the Gallican School.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse, by the vigour of his mind, by the transcendent powers\r\nof his genius, had surmounted the disadvantages of a defective\r\neducation, as some few other great men have done; but it may be fairly\r\ninferred from the nature of things, that, had not that privation existed\r\nin the case of our Philosopher, he would have shone with a still\r\nsuperior lustre, not merely as a man of science, but as a literary\r\ncharacter.[335]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  “If,” (says a late anonymous writer,) “from the advantages of sound\r\n  learning to the state, we turn to its influence on the characters of\r\n  individuals, we will find its effects to be no less striking. We will\r\n  find, that although, without much learning, man may become useful and\r\n  respectable, yet that he cannot, without it, become polished,\r\n  enlightened and great; he cannot ascend to that grade in the scale of\r\n  his Creator’s works, to which his powers are intended to exalt him. If\r\n  to this rule, a Franklin, a Rittenhouse, and a Washington present\r\n  exceptions, they are to regarded as mere exceptions, and therefore do\r\n  not amount to an infraction of the rule. They were prodigies; which\r\n  necessarily implies a departure from, and an ascendency over common\r\n  principles.” See an _Account of Dickinson College, Carlisle_, in the\r\n  _Port Folio_, for March, 1811; supposed to be written by Professor\r\n  Cooper.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Writer of these Memoirs sincerely regrets, that he differs very\r\nwidely, indeed, on this head, from a gentleman who has, himself, been\r\ndistinguished in the literary world by his learning, as well as by his\r\ngenius and science. “In speaking of Mr. Rittenhouse,” says his eloquent\r\nEulogist, “it has been common to lament his want of what is called a\r\nliberal education.”—“Were education what it should be, in our public\r\nseminaries,” continues our ingenious Professor, “this would have been a\r\nmisfortune; but conducted as it is at present, agreeably to the systems\r\nadopted in Europe in the fifteenth century, I am disposed to believe\r\nthat his extensive knowledge, and splendid character, are to be ascribed\r\nchiefly to his having escaped the pernicious influence of monkish\r\nlearning upon his mind, in early life. Had the usual forms of a public\r\neducation in the United States been imposed upon him; instead of\r\nrevolving through life in a planetary orbit, he would probably” says his\r\nEulogist “have consumed the force of his genius by fluttering around the\r\nblaze of an evening taper: Rittenhouse the Philosopher, and one of the\r\nluminaries of the 18th century, might have spent his hours of study in\r\ncomposing syllogisms, or in measuring the feet of Greek and Latin\r\npoetry.” In another part of his Eulogium, (wherein he notices some fine\r\nand benevolent reflections of Dr. Rittenhouse, arising from a\r\ncontemplation of particular works of nature,) Dr. Rush addresses an\r\ninvocation to that distinguished class of learned men, the clergy, in\r\nterms corresponding with his sentiments just quoted:—“If such,” says he,\r\n“be the pious fruits of an attentive examination of the works of the\r\nCreator, cease, ye ministers of the gospel, to defeat the design of your\r\nbenevolent labours, by interposing the common studies of the schools,\r\nbetween our globe and the minds of young people.”[336]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  Three years before Dr. Rush expressed these opinions, so generally\r\n  unfavourable to classical learning and an academic education, he seems\r\n  to have thought these necessary qualifications for a _physician_ at\r\n  least. In his Lecture on the Character of DR. SYDENHAM, delivered in\r\n  Dec. 1793, is this passage: “From the short records of his life, which\r\n  have been published by the different editors of his works, it appears\r\n  that his education in academical learning and medicine, was perfectly\r\n  regular. He became a scholar at Oxford, and a doctor of medicine at\r\n  the university of Cambridge. I mention these facts,” adds our learned\r\n  Professor, “in order to refute an opinion which has been introduced by\r\n  some lazy and illiterate practitioners of physic, that he was indebted\r\n  wholly to intuition for all his knowledge of medicine. Men may become\r\n  wise and distinguished by meditation or observation, in the science of\r\n  morals and religion; but education and study are absolutely necessary\r\n  to constitute a great physician.”\r\n\r\n  With all due deference to the abilities and judgment of the Professor,\r\n  the Memorialist presumes, that if “education and study are absolutely\r\n  necessary to constitute a great physician,” they are equally requisite\r\n  in the formation of a great astronomer: because a knowledge of\r\n  geometry and optics can no more be attained by intuition, than that of\r\n  anatomy and the materia medica; yet these sciences are, respectively,\r\n  indispensable in the formation of the two characters, to which they\r\n  severally relate.\r\n\r\n  Still, adds Dr. Rush, “It is true Dr. Sydenham did not adopt, or\r\n  follow, the errors of the schools in which he had been educated; but,\r\n  by knowing them thoroughly, he was able, more easily, to examine and\r\n  refute them.” Here, then, is an admission, that even an intimate\r\n  knowledge of such errors is eminently useful, by enabling a man of a\r\n  sound and cultivated mind to refute them: for, the refutation of\r\n  existing errors, affords a most important aid to the advancement of\r\n  true science.\r\n\r\n  Sydenham, it appears, received his collegiate education at both the\r\n  English universities. It may not therefore be improper, on this\r\n  occasion, to introduce a quotation from an invaluable elementary\r\n  work;[336a] in order to shew, what was the opinion entertained by a\r\n  learned and distinguished German, of the English Universities—on the\r\n  models of which, the higher seminaries of learning in the United\r\n  States are formed. “Of all the Universities of Europe,” says Baron\r\n  Bielfeld, “those of Oxford and Cambridge in England appear at present\r\n  to approach the nearest to perfection: The great men they produce, are\r\n  a better proof than any other argument.[336b] We could wish,” adds\r\n  this highly enlightened foreigner, “always to see an university a real\r\n  city of learning, a place consecrated entirely to the muses and their\r\n  disciples; that the Greek and Latin languages were there predominant;\r\n  and that every thing were banished from thence, which could cause the\r\n  least dissipation in those who devote themselves to letters.” “The man\r\n  who confines himself to his closet,”—says our author, in another\r\n  place,—“is but rarely visited by the sciences, the arts and the belles\r\n  lettres: to acquire their intimate acquaintance, he must seek them in\r\n  those places where Minerva, Pallas, Apollo, and the Muses, have fixed\r\n  their residence. Emulation, that strong impulse in the career of all\r\n  our pursuits, should constantly attend the man of letters from his\r\n  early youth to the last period of his life; in the school, at college,\r\n  at the university, in those employments to which his knowledge may\r\n  lead him, or in those academies of science to which he may be\r\n  admitted. Emulation is an animating faculty, that results from\r\n  society: and few there are, to whom nature has given a genius\r\n  sufficiently strong to attain an extensive erudition in solitude; who\r\n  are provided with wings that can bear them, without guides, without\r\n  models, without companions or supports, to the lofty regions of the\r\n  empyrean.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 336a:\r\n\r\n  The Elements of Universal Erudition, containing an analytical\r\n  abridgment of the Sciences, Polite Arts, and Belles Lettres; by Baron\r\n  Bielfeld. In three 8vo. volumes; translated from a Berlin edition, by\r\n  W. Hooper, M. D. and printed in London, in the year 1770.\r\n\r\nFootnote 336b:\r\n\r\n  The three great Universities of England and Ireland enjoy the right,\r\n  in addition to many other important privileges, of sending, each, two\r\n  members to represent them in parliament, Would to heaven! that there\r\n  were something like a representation of the interests of learning and\r\n  science, in the legislative bodies of our own country.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, the “monkish learning” of the fifteenth century was now\r\ntaught among us; if “composing syllogisms,” and “measuring the feet of\r\nGreek and Latin poetry,” were now the sole objects of scholastic\r\ninstruction in this country; then might our learned Professor have\r\nanathematized, with good reason, the system of teaching in our\r\nUniversities and Colleges. But it is well known, that the Aristotelian\r\nPhilosophy, and what is denominated the Learning of the Schools, has\r\nbeen gradually declining in the European seminaries of learning, in the\r\ncourse of the last two centuries;[337] and more particularly so, in the\r\ngreat schools of Britain and Ireland: that the system of academic\r\ninstruction, deduced from the visionary theories of the philosophers of\r\nantiquity, is there, as well as here, nearly, if not entirely exploded.\r\nIt is true, the Greek and Latin tongues are yet taught with great\r\nassiduity and success, in the British Isles; as they have hitherto been,\r\namong ourselves:[338] and it is confidently hoped, that those languages\r\nwill long continue to be cultivated with unabated zeal, in this country;\r\nwhatever may be their fate on the European continent, where it is said\r\nthey are rapidly declining, along with other branches of useful\r\nlearning, and accompanied by an evident decay of many social\r\nrefinements. Those languages are, in fact, valuable auxiliaries in the\r\nattainment of many branches of useful science, and have ever been\r\nconsidered the best _substratum_ of polite learning and literary taste.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  Bacon (the celebrated Viscount of St. Albans and Baron of Verulam)\r\n  published his great philosophical work, the _Novum Organum_, in the\r\n  year 1620. The learned and sagacious professor Cooper remarks, that\r\n  “Lord Bacon” (whom the honourable Mr. Walpole considers as the Prophet\r\n  of the Arts, which NEWTON came to reveal,) “was the first among the\r\n  moderns, who pointed out the way by which real knowledge was to be\r\n  obtained, and turned the minds of the learned from playing tricks with\r\n  syllogisms, and the legerdemain of words without ideas; and taught\r\n  them to rest theory upon the basis of experiment alone.” See the\r\n  Introductory Lecture of Thomas Cooper, Esq. Professor of Chemistry at\r\n  Carlisle College, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  The Greek and Latin are called by way of pre-eminence, the learned\r\n  languages. Baron Bielfeld enumerates the advantages resulting from a\r\n  knowledge of the former; among which he notices that important one, of\r\n  its enabling us more readily and clearly to comprehend the meaning of\r\n  that almost boundless list of terms in the arts and sciences, used in\r\n  modern languages and styled technical, which are either altogether\r\n  Grecian, or derived from that language. He then makes this remark:\r\n  “From all that has been said, it is apparent how much utility attends\r\n  the study of the Greek tongue; and how much reason the English have,\r\n  for applying themselves to it, from their early youth.” “But,”\r\n  observes this learned and discriminating writer, “that which has given\r\n  the Latin an advantage over the Greek itself, that has rendered it\r\n  indispensable to every man of letters, and has made it the basis of\r\n  erudition, is, that during the middle age, and in general in all\r\n  modern times, the learned of all Europe have made it their common and\r\n  universal language; so that the Latin forms, if we may use the\r\n  expression, the natural language of the sciences.” _Elem. of Univ.\r\n  Erud._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nA man may, assuredly, be a profound astronomer; he may be eminently\r\nskilled in other branches of natural science, or in the doctrines of\r\nmorals; he may be well versed in the polite arts; and yet may not\r\nunderstand either Greek or Latin. Nevertheless, an intimate and\r\nclassical acquaintance with these languages cannot diminish the powers\r\nof his mind, or render him less capable of excelling in other\r\ndepartments of human knowledge. Bacon, Newton, Boyle, and Maclauren,\r\nwith a multitude of others, the most distinguished for genius, science\r\nand learning, received an academical education; they were masters of the\r\nGreek and Latin languages; and were also instructed, without doubt, even\r\nin the formation of syllogisms:[339] yet these great men were not the\r\nless eminent as philosophers. It is to be presumed, that, while at their\r\nseveral schools and colleges, they were employed in acquiring the more\r\nsolid and useful parts of learning; as well as the ornamental and\r\npolite. Both are taught in all the higher seminaries; and to the\r\nUniversities of the United States, as well as of Europe, are attached\r\nProfessorships[340] for such instruction.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 339:\r\n\r\n  Although Mr. T. Cooper (before quoted) admits, that the “strict\r\n  adherence to the syllogistic mode of reasoning,” that which he calls\r\n  “playing tricks with syllogisms,” together with “the legerdemain of\r\n  words without ideas,” was carried much too far by some late\r\n  metaphysical writers of eminence; yet he is of opinion, that “in\r\n  modern times, this invention of Aristotle is abandoned more than it\r\n  deserves to be: For,” continues Mr. Cooper, “no man can so skilfully\r\n  analyse the argument of another, as one who is well acquainted with\r\n  the rules of scholastic logic, and accustomed to apply them. Good\r\n  reasoners there are and will be, who know nothing of these rules, but\r\n  better reasoners who do.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Cooper doubts, whether metaphysical lectures should be delivered,\r\n  at all, in colleges; but thinks, that if metaphysics were to be there\r\n  taught, the writings of Beattie, Oswald and Gregory, would be unworthy\r\n  of notice. Much as the Writer of these Memoirs respects the talents\r\n  and ingenuity of the learned Professor of Chemistry, he can by no\r\n  means concur in this opinion: and he regrets, that he feels himself\r\n  obliged to differ still more widely, from a gentleman of such\r\n  acknowledged abilities, respecting the propriety of his recommending\r\n  to youth the study of the works of Hobbes, Leibnitz and Collins.\r\n\r\n  Now, what the complexion and tendency of the tenets of Hobbes,\r\n  Leibnitz, and other philosophers of the same class are, may be learnt\r\n  from the following passages, translated from a French work, entitled,\r\n  “_De la Philosophie de la Nature, ou Traité de Morale pour l’Epece\r\n  Humaine, tire de la Philosophie et fonde sur la Nature_;” a work\r\n  which, though anonymous in respect to its author, had passed through\r\n  three editions in the year 1777. The writer thus says:\r\n\r\n  “Of what importance to me are the names of Carneades, of Lysander, of\r\n  Hobbes, and the author of _The System of Nature_, names unhappily\r\n  celebrated, which the apostle of the moral indifference of human\r\n  actions alleges in favour of this atrocious extravagance?” (the\r\n  doctrines of Fatality, Moral Scepticism, &c.) “Carneades was an\r\n  arrogant Pyrrhonian, who doubted of every thing, excepting the\r\n  superiority of his own logic. Hobbes had the audacity to write a book\r\n  against the everlasting truths of geometry. Lysander, the enemy of the\r\n  liberty of Sparta, and the corrupter of the oracles of Delos and\r\n  Ammon, was one of those spirits of spleen and filth, who strive to\r\n  acquire a name by reducing wickedness to a system. As for the\r\n  anonymous Writer, whose licentious pen vents so much blasphemy on\r\n  Nature, in disavowing the existence of GOD, he has purchased the right\r\n  to deny that of Morality. He is equally silly with Salmonius, in\r\n  braving the thunderbolt destined to stifle the stings of conscience.”\r\n  Speaking of Leibnitz, in another place, this French Moralist observes,\r\n  that “the Philosopher of Leipsick made of the soul a monad, and\r\n  explained all the phænomena of its union with matter by a\r\n  pre-established harmony. One portion of Europe believed him; because\r\n  he set up a new system! and what is it but a metaphysical theory,\r\n  without system?” And again: “What names have we to oppose to those of\r\n  Descartes, Leibnitz, Pascal and Malbranch? The suffrage of NEWTON,\r\n  alone, is sufficient to crush their Materialism; if, in the humble\r\n  materials for the examination of human reason, the suffrage of one\r\n  great man is competent to balance a syllogism.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 340:\r\n\r\n  The professorships, all well supported and endowed, which are\r\n  established at Oxford and Cambridge, (and, probably, there are similar\r\n  institutions in the universities of Scotland and Ireland,) are in the\r\n  following departments of literature and science: viz. Divinity,\r\n  Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Modern Languages, History (general,) Modern\r\n  History, Civil Law, Common Law, Physic, Anatomy, Botany, Chemistry,\r\n  Natural Philosophy, Experimental Philosophy, Astronomy, Mathematics,\r\n  Geometry, Moral Philosophy, Casuistry, Music.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe able and learned editor of “The American Review of History and\r\nPolitics”[341] remarks, that, “for very obvious reasons it could not be\r\nexpected, that Philology would be duly appreciated, or cultivated to any\r\nextent, by the American public in general. The state of society in this\r\ncountry, so admirable under many points of view, renders this\r\nimpossible. We should not be surprised or discouraged at a general\r\nignorance of, and an almost universal indifference about the learned\r\nlanguages: but this is not all; the public feeling is not confined to\r\nmere apathy: it borders on hostility. Numbers are not wanting, persons\r\neven of influence in the community, who industriously proclaim, not\r\nsimply the utter insignificance, but the pernicious tendency of\r\nclassical learning; and who would proscribe it as idle in itself, and as\r\ndangerous to republicanism. At the same time, our progress in this\r\npursuit is far from being in a natural ratio with our advances in other\r\nrespects. Philology is in fact, even worse than stationary among us;\r\nfrom what cause, whether from the influence of the extraordinary notions\r\njust mentioned, or from the absence of all external excitements, we will\r\nnot now pretend to determine.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 341:\r\n\r\n  See the editorial review, in that work, of an “Historical Report upon\r\n  the progress of History and ancient Literature, since the year 1789,\r\n  and upon their actual condition,” &c. vol. iii. No 1.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nShould these judicious remarks of the respectable Reviewer be considered\r\nas containing an indirect censure on such “persons of influence” as he\r\nmay be supposed to allude to, who “proclaim” the “pernicious tendency of\r\nclassical learning,”—it is much to be lamented by the friends of\r\nliterature and science, that there should be any just grounds for its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse understood the German[342] and Low Dutch languages,\r\nwell; and had acquired a sufficient knowledge of the French, to enable\r\nhim to comprehend astronomical and other works written in that tongue.\r\nThese acquisitions, it has been observed, “served the valuable purpose\r\nof conveying to him the discoveries of foreign nations, and thereby\r\nenabled him to prosecute his studies with more advantage in his native\r\nlanguage.”[343]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 342:\r\n\r\n  In the year 1789, Dr. Rittenhouse translated from the German of Mr.\r\n  Lessing, director of the theatre at Hamburg, a tragedy called _Lucia\r\n  Sampson_; which translation was printed; in the same year, by Mr.\r\n  Charles Cist, of Philadelphia. In the preface to it, the translator\r\n  says:—“This translation was attempted at the request of a friend; and\r\n  the many virtuous sentiments and excellent lessons of morality it\r\n  contains, will apologize for its being offered to the public. To young\r\n  ladies it may afford useful instruction, and will, from the nature of\r\n  the distress, be particularly useful to them: an elegant writer well\r\n  acquainted with the human heart, has observed, that the affection of a\r\n  father to his daughter unites extreme sensibility with the utmost\r\n  delicacy; and this sentiment is, no doubt, in a great degree\r\n  reciprocal.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  See Dr. Rush’s Eulog. on Ritt.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut these were not the whole of his philological attainments. By the\r\ndint of genius, and by that spirit of perseverance which he manifested\r\nin every thing he undertook, he overcame in a great degree the\r\ndifficulties of the Latin tongue.[344] This he did for the same valuable\r\npurpose that he had in view, in learning the German, Low Dutch and\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n  The memorialist undertakes to say, on the authority of his father (the\r\n  late Rev. Mr. Barton,) that our philosopher was sufficiently well\r\n  versed in the Latin, to have read Newton’s _Principia_ in that\r\n  language, besides studying it in his native tongue: and further, that,\r\n  although he was very imperfectly acquainted with the grammatical\r\n  construction of the Greek language, he had so far familiarized himself\r\n  to a knowledge of its written characters and words, as enabled him to\r\n  consult a lexicon; which he frequently did, for the purpose of\r\n  ascertaining the true etymology of many of those technical terms,\r\n  derived from the Greek, that are in common use in our language,\r\n  particularly in relation to his favourite sciences.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe reading of our Philosopher was extensive. It embraced every\r\ndepartment of polite literature, as well as many branches of what is\r\ncalled, by way of distinction, useful knowledge. He appears to have been\r\nmore particularly attached to history, voyages and travels, and to the\r\npoetick muse:[345] but the drama, ingenious productions of the\r\nimagination, and other works of taste and fancy, likewise engaged a\r\nportion of his attention.[346] Dr. Rush asserts, that he had early and\r\ndeeply studied most of the different systems of theology.[347] On this\r\nhead, no further information can be given by the writer of these\r\nMemoirs: yet he thinks he has good reason for believing,—and such as are\r\nindependent of Dr. Rittenhouse’s known liberality, with respect to\r\nvarious modes of faith and worship, that he never gave a very decided\r\npreference to any one regular society of Christians, over others; he\r\nloved that sort of Christianity, which inculcates sound morals: his\r\ncharity, in regard to theological opinions and other concerns of\r\nreligion, was great; and he felt no disposition to observe any thing\r\nlike a scrupulous adherence to such tenets or rites, as he deemed less\r\nessential to the well-being of mankind. It was, in fact, the liberal\r\nmanner (and this alone) in which he sometimes expressed himself on\r\nsubjects of this nature, influenced by sentiments of the purest\r\nbenevolence, that induced some persons of more rigid principles, and\r\nperhaps less candour, to doubt the soundness of his faith in revealed\r\nreligion: but the whole tenor of his life, and the religious sentiments\r\nhe had publicly and repeatedly avowed, shew how ill-founded such\r\nsuspicions were.[348] A mind so contemplative as his, so devoted to the\r\npursuit of truth, so boundless in its views, and so ardently attached to\r\nvirtue, would naturally lead him to an investigation of the principles\r\nof Christianity; and it is evident from some passages in his Oration,\r\nand also in his familiar letters to his friends, that he believed in the\r\nfundamental articles of the Christian faith,[349] however he may have\r\ndoubted respecting some of the more abstract and less important tenets\r\nof the church.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 345:\r\n\r\n  In Hill’s Life of Dr. Barrow, it is remarked, that this great\r\n  Mathematician (as well as learned Divine) “was always addicted to\r\n  poetry, and very much valued that part of it which consists of\r\n  description.” In like manner, Dr. Rittenhouse delighted in poetic\r\n  effusions of genius and science. His Eulogist observes, that “the muse\r\n  of Thomson charmed him most:” indeed, an astronomer, and a man of\r\n  virtue and taste, could not but be charmed by the chaste and glowing\r\n  descriptions of that fascinating poet, blended, as they are, with\r\n  philosophical reflections. Our philosopher, however, greatly admired\r\n  Milton also: so that these two celebrated votaries of the muses seemed\r\n  to be his favourites. Why should not these partialities of Rittenhouse\r\n  be noticed?—when similar observations have been made respecting the\r\n  characters of other men, eminent in science; as, for example, that the\r\n  favourite author of Erasmus and the younger Scaliger, was Terence, and\r\n  that Grotius was an admirer of Terence, Lucan and Horace.\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  _Nec lusisse pudet_, is an observation which has, in particular\r\n  instances, been applied to the occasional conduct and disposition of\r\n  some of the wisest, best, and even gravest characters. Dr. Warton, in\r\n  remarking on this line of Mr. Pope, viz.\r\n\r\n             “Unthought-of frailties cheat us in the wise,”—\r\n\r\n  says; “Who could imagine that Locke was fond of romances; that Newton\r\n  once studied astrology; that Dr. Clarke valued himself for his\r\n  agility, and frequently amused himself, in a private room of his\r\n  house, in leaping over the tables and chairs; and that our author\r\n  himself (Mr Pope) was a great epicure.”\r\n\r\n  In our own country, the sage Franklin abounded in anecdote and humour,\r\n  and thought it not unwise to recreate his mind, at times, with the\r\n  game of chess: the conversation of Judge Hopkinson was replete with\r\n  sprightly wit, and he admired well written novels of no immoral\r\n  tendency; as did also the late Judge Wilson: the illustrious\r\n  Washington, in his earlier years, enjoyed the pleasures of the festive\r\n  board, in the society of men of understanding and worth: and no man\r\n  delighted more in cheerful conversation, and in reading works of fancy\r\n  and taste, than the philosophic Rittenhouse. The almost universal\r\n  tendency, in persons of all classes, to an occasional playfulness of\r\n  temper, even in cases which may sometimes be considered as bordering\r\n  on weakness, has given the force of a maxim to the observation of the\r\n  latinists—_Nemo omnibus horis sapit_. Indeed, as a biographer of the\r\n  celebrated Dr. Clarke has remarked, “to be capable of drawing\r\n  amusement from trivial circumstances, indicates a heart at ease, and\r\n  may generally be regarded as the concomitant of virtue.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 347:\r\n\r\n  See Dr. Rush’s Eulog. on Ritt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 348:\r\n\r\n  Sir Isaac Newton, it is well known, was thoroughly persuaded of the\r\n  Truth of Revelation: yet he did not escape the imputation of being an\r\n  Arian, Mr. Whiston having represented him as such. It is equally a\r\n  matter of notoriety, that similar opinions have prevailed respecting\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse’s religious creed: nay, further, that doubts were\r\n  entertained by some, whether he believed at all in the fundamental\r\n  principles of the Christian religion. In one instance, indeed, a\r\n  virulent party-writer[348a] had the hardiness, one might say folly, to\r\n  proclaim him an “Atheist!” The publication in which this false and\r\n  shameful accusation was made, appeared about the time of Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse’s death, and, it is believed, shortly after that event.\r\n\r\n  As a Biographer of such a man as Rittenhouse, the Author of these\r\n  Memoirs would do great injustice to his memory, did he not lay before\r\n  his readers, in a full and undisguised manner, that sort of testimony\r\n  concerning our Philosopher’s religious sentiments, which it is\r\n  presumed will eradicate every doubt or suspicion, that has heretofore\r\n  existed in the minds of some, on the subject. He is aware of the\r\n  influence, which the opinions of eminently wise and good men (or, of\r\n  such sentiments as are sometimes attributed to them,) have, in their\r\n  operation on society; and, in every point of view, he fully estimates\r\n  the importance of representing them to the world, in a strict\r\n  conformity to truth.\r\n\r\n  These considerations have induced the Memorialist to devote a larger\r\n  portion of his work to an elucidation of Dr. Rittenhouse’s real\r\n  opinions on the all-important subject of Religion, than he should have\r\n  thought proper, under other circumstances, to appropriate to that part\r\n  of his character.\r\n\r\n  Under these impressions, then, the Memorialist could not think it\r\n  consistent with his duty, to withhold from the public a letter\r\n  addressed to him by the Rev. Mr. Cathcart, a clergyman of much\r\n  respectability and pastor of a presbyterian congregation in the\r\n  borough of York. This letter (which will be found in the Appendix)\r\n  contains what may be fairly deemed conclusive evidence, even if such\r\n  had been before wanting, that Dr. Rittenhouse was “a firm Believer in\r\n  Christianity.” Bishop White had communicated to the Memorialist, in\r\n  conversation, the interesting facts stated in Mr. Cathcart’s letter;\r\n  the knowledge of which, the Bishop had derived, verbally, from that\r\n  gentleman: his letter was written in answer to one which the\r\n  Memorialist addressed to him, on the occasion, at the instance of the\r\n  Right Rev. Prelate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 348a:\r\n\r\n  Mr. William Cobbett.\r\n\r\nFootnote 349:\r\n\r\n  “Astronomy, like the Christian religion, if you will allow me the\r\n  comparison,” said our Philosopher, “has a much greater influence on\r\n  our knowledge in general, and perhaps on our manners too, than is\r\n  commonly imagined. Though but few men are its particular votaries, yet\r\n  the light it affords is universally diffused among us; and it is\r\n  difficult for us to divest ourselves of its influence so far, as to\r\n  frame any competent idea of what would be our situation without it.”\r\n  See _Ritt. Orat._\r\n\r\n  In another part of his Oration, is this passage: “Our Religion teaches\r\n  us what Philosophy could not have taught: and we ought to admire, with\r\n  reverence, the great things it has pleased Divine Providence to\r\n  perform, beyond the ordinary course of nature, for man, who is,\r\n  undoubtedly, the most noble inhabitant of this globe:” &c.\r\n\r\n  And in addition to these sentiments, uttered and published by our\r\n  Philosopher himself, let the testimony of Dr. Rush, who had long and\r\n  intimately known him, be quoted from the learned Professor’s Eulogium.\r\n  “He believed in the Christian Revelation,” says the Doctor: and then\r\n  subjoins, “Of this he gave many proofs; not only in the conformity of\r\n  his life to the precepts of the Gospel, but in his letters and\r\n  conversation.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Rittenhouse never attached himself to the distinguishing dogmas\r\nof any one sect of Christians; so, on the authority of a letter\r\naddressed to the Memorialist by Mr. B. Rittenhouse, soon after his\r\nbrother’s decease, it may be asserted, that our Philosopher “was never\r\njoined in communion with any particular religious society; though he\r\nesteemed good men of all sects.” In his youth, it is probable he was\r\nbred a Baptist; the sect to which his father (and, it is believed, his\r\nmother also,) belonged: at subsequent periods, he entertained favourable\r\nopinions of the church of England, and of the principles of the quakers\r\n(so called.) In some of the latter years of his life, he and his family\r\npretty frequently attended divine service in a presbyterian\r\ncongregation, of which a very respectable and worthy gentleman then was\r\nthe pastor and until very lately continued to officiate as such.[350]\r\nThat church is situated in the same street wherein Dr. Rittenhouse\r\ndwelt; and its then minister was one of many clergymen, belonging to\r\ndifferent churches, whom he personally esteemed.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 350:\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Ashbel Green, D. D. This gentleman succeeded the Rev. Dr.\r\n  Sproat, an aged clergyman, of amiable disposition and unaffected\r\n  piety, for whose character our Philosopher entertained a great esteem,\r\n  and, during the latter part of whose ministry in that church, he first\r\n  attended it. Dr. Green has lately become President of the College of\r\n  New-Jersey, in consequence of the resignation of the learned and\r\n  eloquent Samuel Stanhope Smith, D. D.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSome of his letters to his confidential friends testify, nevertheless,\r\nthat he by no means embraced some of the doctrines of Calvinism: nor\r\ndid he, probably, approve of others, in their more rigid\r\ninterpretation.[351] In one of those letters, addressed to the Rev.\r\nMr. Barton, (an Episcopalian, of the English church,) from\r\nPhiladelphia, so early as September, 1755, he wrote thus: “I have been\r\nhere several days, and am fatigued and somewhat indisposed. You know\r\nmy spirits are never very high, and will therefore expect a melancholy\r\nletter from me at present. I should be glad of opportunities to\r\nreceive letters from you, and to write to you oftener:—indeed, I am\r\ndesirous of disclosing to you some of my most serious thoughts.” It\r\ncan scarcely be doubted, from the complexion of this paragraph and the\r\ncharacter of the person to whom our then young philosopher was\r\nwriting, that these “most serious thoughts,” which he wished so much\r\nto disclose to his clerical friend, related to some points in\r\ndivinity. After subjoining, in the same letter, some reflexions, of\r\nsuch a cast as shew that his spirits were depressed by fatigue and\r\nindisposition, as was usually the case with him, he proceeded thus: “I\r\nassure you, notwithstanding, I am no misanthrope; but think good\r\nsociety one of the greatest blessings of life. Whatever is said of\r\noriginal sin, the depravity of our nature, and our propensity to all\r\nevil; though men are said to be wolves to men; yet, think, I can see\r\nabundance of goodness in human nature, with which I am enamoured. I\r\nwould sooner give up my interest in a future state, than be divested\r\nof humanity;—I mean, that good-will which I have to the species,\r\nalthough one half of them are said to be fools, and almost the other\r\nhalf knaves. Indeed I am firmly persuaded that we are not at the\r\ndisposal of a Being who has the least tincture of ill-nature, or\r\nrequires any in us. You will laugh at this grave philosophy, or my\r\nwriting to you on a subject you have thought of a thousand times. But,\r\ncan any thing that is serious, be ridiculous? Shall we suppose Gabriel\r\nsmiling at Newton, for labouring to demonstrate whether the earth\r\nmoves or not, because the former plainly sees it move?”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 351:\r\n\r\n  The following extract of a letter, which Professor Rusk was so\r\n  obliging as to address to the writer of these memoirs, in the spring\r\n  of the year 1812, in answer to some questions proposed by the\r\n  memorialist, favours the presumption, that our philosopher in some\r\n  points dissented from the opinions of very respectable Calvinistic\r\n  Divines, on the subject of religion. “I understood from the Rev. Dr.\r\n  Green,” says the learned Professor, that his late colleague, the Rev.\r\n  Dr. Sproat, had informed him, that in a visit he once paid to Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse, they were led accidentally to converse upon a religious\r\n  subject, on which they held different opinions. Dr. Sproat, in\r\n  defending his opinions, quoted several texts of scripture; but\r\n  observed, after doing so; “Perhaps, Mr. Rittenhouse, you do not admit\r\n  of the validity of arguments derived from the bible.” “Pardon me,\r\n  Sir,” (said Mr. Rittenhouse,) “I admit the divine authority of the\r\n  contents of that book.” Another fact stated by Dr. Rush, at the same\r\n  time, and which was also communicated to the memorialist, by a very\r\n  near and dear friend of the deceased, is thus related by the Doctor:\r\n  “His late worthy companion, Mrs. Rittenhouse, informed me, that the\r\n  last sourse from whence he derived intellectual and moral pleasure,\r\n  was Dr. Price’s excellent sermon upon the _Goodness of God_, which she\r\n  read to him, at his request, on the two successive days before he\r\n  died.” It may not be thought unworthy of being remarked on this\r\n  occasion, that Mr. T. Dobson, of Philadelphia, republished Price’s\r\n  Sermons, in the year 1788, and that Mrs. Rittenhouse’s name appears in\r\n  the list of subscribers to that edition.\r\n\r\n  In Dr. Rush’s letter, just quoted, he introduces the subject in these\r\n  terms. “In answer to your question, relative to the religious opinions\r\n  of your late uncle and my excellent friend, Dr. Rittenhouse, I am\r\n  happy in being able to inform you, that I have no doubt of his having\r\n  been a sincere believer in the most essential doctrines of the\r\n  Christian religion: the ground upon which I formed this opinion, were\r\n  derived not only from many incidental remarks in its favour, that fell\r\n  from him in our conversations upon other subjects, but from the\r\n  testimony of persons upon whose correctness I have the fullest\r\n  reliance.”\r\n\r\n  Upon the whole it appears, that although our philosopher was, most\r\n  probably, not strictly Calvinistical in his religious creed, he was\r\n  nevertheless a pious man, and a sincere Christian in the fundamental\r\n  articles of his faith.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis extract (the latter part of which constitutes a note to Dr. Rush’s\r\nEulogium,) expresses, in the concluding sentence, a beautiful and apt\r\nallusion, in reference to the subject. It likewise contains a\r\nfinely-turned compliment to the superior knowledge he presumed Mr.\r\nBarton to possess, on theological subjects; without its seeming to have\r\nbeen intended, that it should comprehend himself also,—otherwise than as\r\nhe might be considered, for a moment, to be personating that branch of\r\nscience which he most assiduously cultivated. The compliment, so far as\r\nit appeared to apply to himself, was unquestionably due to him; but his\r\nmodesty would have forbidden his using it, even to a brother-in-law,\r\ncould he have imagined at the instant of penning it, that a portion of\r\nit might be referred to himself, personally.\r\n\r\nThe whole scope of the passage, just quoted, “shews,” however, as his\r\nEulogist has observed, “how early and deeply the principles of universal\r\nbenevolence were fixed in his mind.” And in his Oration, composed when\r\nhe was in the full meridian of life, our Philosopher has plainly\r\nindicated, that the same philanthropic spirit, that species of\r\nbenevolence which is the basis of true religion, and that warmed his\r\nyouthful breast, continued to animate it with unabated fervency: “That\r\nBeing,” said he, “before whose piercing eye all the intricate foldings\r\nand dark recesses of the human heart become expanded and illuminated, is\r\nmy witness, with what sincerity, with what ardour, I wish for the\r\nhappiness of the whole race of mankind; how much I admire that\r\ndisposition of lands and seas, which affords a communication between\r\ndistant regions, and a mutual exchange of benefits; how sincerely I\r\napprove of those social refinements which really add to our happiness,\r\nand induce us with gratitude to acknowledge our great Creator’s\r\ngoodness; how I delight in a participation of the discoveries made from\r\ntime to time in nature’s works, by our philosophic brethren in Europe.”\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of our Philosopher, “every enlargement of our faculties,\r\nevery new happiness conferred upon us, every step we advance towards the\r\nperfection of the Divinity, will very probably render us more and more\r\nsensible of his inexhaustible stores of communicable bliss, and of his\r\ninaccessible perfections.”[352] He supposed, that, even in this world,\r\n“wherein we are only permitted ‘_to look about us and to die_,’ there is\r\nample provision made for employing every faculty of the human mind; even\r\nallowing its powers to be constantly enlarged through an endless\r\nrepetition of ages;” but admitting, at the same time, “that there is\r\nnothing in it capable of satisfying us.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 352:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse had no more faith in the notion entertained by some\r\n  visionary men, of the attainment of the perfection of virtue, in this\r\n  life, than he had in the fantastic opinion, maintained also by some,\r\n  of the perfectibility of human reason. He supposed that we are\r\n  capable, by a progressive “enlargement of our faculties,” to “advance\r\n  towards the perfection of the Divinity;” not like those pretenders to\r\n  philosophy, who, as Mr. Voltaire expresses it, “took it into their\r\n  heads, by the example of Descartes, to put themselves into God’s\r\n  place, and create a world with a word!” Our philosopher knew, that\r\n  pure virtue and perfect reason do not belong to human nature.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSimilar indications of his extensive benevolence, and of the high sense\r\nhe entertained of the dignity of human nature, as well as of the\r\nattributes of the Deity, are found every where in his writings; and the\r\n“elegant and pious extract” (as it is termed by Dr. Rush, in his\r\nEulogium,) from a letter to one of his friends, quoted in another place,\r\naffords a striking instance of the prevalence of that disposition in the\r\ntowering mind of Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nIf “he believed political, as well as moral, evil, to be intruders into\r\nthe society of men,”[353] he was certainly too well acquainted with the\r\nmoral constitution of man and the evident nature of humanity, to\r\nsuppose, “that a time would come, when every part of our globe would\r\necho back the heavenly proclamation of universal peace on earth and good\r\nwill to man.”[354] Possessing a most benevolent disposition, he did\r\nbelieve, “that a conduct in this life, depending on our choice, will\r\nstamp our characters for ages yet to come.” He was so far from expecting\r\nany thing like perfectibility here, that he thought, that man as a free\r\nagent, in darkening his faculties by an unworthy application of them\r\nhere on earth, might “degrade himself to some inferior rank of being,”\r\nhereafter; while, on the other hand, by “the exercise of virtue, and a\r\nrational employment of those talents we are entrusted with,”—“we shall,\r\nin a few years, be promoted to a more exalted rank among the creatures\r\nof God—have our understandings greatly enlarged—be enabled to follow\r\nTruth in all her labyrinths, with an higher relish and more facility;\r\nand thus lay the foundation for an eternal improvement in knowledge and\r\nhappiness.” Our Philosopher acknowledged, that he was “not one of those\r\nsanguine spirits who seem to think, that, when the withered hand of\r\ndeath hath drawn up the curtain of eternity, almost all distance between\r\nthe creature and the creator, between finite and infinite, will be\r\nannihilated.”[355] Yet, the Writer of these Memoirs has no hesitation in\r\nexpressing an opinion, with which a long and intimate acquaintance with\r\nDr. Rittenhouse has forcibly impressed his own mind; that this virtuous\r\nman was inclined to believe, or rather, actually did believe, (with the\r\ndistinguished author of the Dissertation on the Prophecies,)[356] in a\r\nfinal restitution of all things to harmony and happiness in another\r\nstate of existence.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 353:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rush’s Eulogium.\r\n\r\nFootnote 354:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 355:\r\n\r\n  This quotation and the other passages, before which inverted commas\r\n  are placed in the margin, in the two last paragraphs of the text, are\r\n  extracted from Dr. Rittenhouse’s Oration.\r\n\r\nFootnote 356:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Thomas Newton, Bishop of Bristol.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe learned Eulogist of our Philosopher, whom his present biographer has\r\nalready so often quoted with much interest and pleasure, (although he\r\nis, on some points, so unfortunate as to be compelled to dissent from\r\nhim,) has remarked, that Dr. Rittenhouse “was well acquainted with\r\npractical metaphysics.” He had, without doubt, attentively studied those\r\nbranches, at least, of this science, which embrace moral philosophy,\r\nconnected, as it is, with a rational system of natural religion:\r\nprobably, too, he had investigated its more abstruse and less useful\r\ndepartments: and, perhaps, he had also directed his all-inquisitive\r\nmind, in some degree, to a contemplation of those mental vagaries of the\r\nmodern philosophy, as it is termed, which neither subserve the purposes\r\nof ethics or of natural theology: a system, if it deserve that\r\nappellation, made up of such incongruous materials, such visionary\r\nnotions, as by their falsity alone, independently of their mischievous\r\noperation in society, seem calculated to dishonour the name of\r\nphilosophy, and to depreciate the highly meritorious services rendered\r\nto mankind by the votaries of true science. If, however, Dr. Rittenhouse\r\never did condescend to employ any considerable portion of his valuable\r\ntime, in making himself acquainted with the delusive principles of this\r\nmultifarious sect of pseudo-philosophers, it has been already manifested\r\nwith what sentiments of disapprobation, if not of abhorrence, he\r\nregarded their doctrines.[357]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 357:\r\n\r\n  A late learned philosopher and eloquent divine, after adverting to the\r\n  irrational and infatuated notions of men of the class above referred\r\n  to, contrasted with doctrines founded in truth, and the awful gloom,\r\n  destitute of every ray of consolation, that must necessarily accompany\r\n  their reflections upon their own principles, addresses to them this\r\n  short but serious invocation: “When these things are fairly weighed,\r\n  as in nature they exist, I call on you, nay I challenge you, ye\r\n  boasting philosophists! to comfort yourselves, and be easy under your\r\n  dreary doctrine, or notion of being safe after death, in a state of\r\n  annihilation or future nothingness! I call on you, ye wise Illuminati!\r\n  of upstart name, to weigh these things seriously; and try whether you\r\n  can comfort yourselves, and remain easy, in considering, and striving\r\n  to make others consider, Death, as only an “everlasting Sleep,” from\r\n  which they will never be awakened, nor their ashes disturbed!” See\r\n  Sermon V. in _The Works of William Smith, D. D. late Provost of the\r\n  College and Academy of Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\n  In no instance have the impious and absurd doctrines of the\r\n  “Philosophists” and the “Illuminati,” of our times, been carried to\r\n  such a height of extravagance, as by the revolutionists of modern\r\n  France. These infatuated people undertook, in the year 1793, to\r\n  abolish by Law, a Futurity of Existence; having then decreed, that no\r\n  such state existed! They also decreed, that in every cemetery there\r\n  should be erected a figure representing Sleep, pointing towards the\r\n  tombs; and this Sleep of Death, the decree declared to be eternal!! It\r\n  is to this sort of wickedness and folly that an allusion is made, in\r\n  the foregoing quotation; as well as in the following lines, copied\r\n  from the _Pursuits of Literature_:\r\n\r\n              “Systems which laugh to scorn th’avenging rod,\r\n              And hurl defiance at the throne of GOD;\r\n              Shake pestilence abroad with madd’ning sweep,\r\n              And grant no pause—but everlasting Sleep!”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIt being presumed, therefore, that our Philosopher was, in the words of\r\nhis Eulogist, “well acquainted with practical metaphysics,” an inference\r\nmay thence be fairly made, that, with respect to metaphysical\r\ndeductions, “he could use them,” as has been said of Maclaurin, “with as\r\nmuch subtlety and force as any man living; but”—also like that\r\ncelebrated philosopher—“he chose rather, in his conversation as well as\r\nhis writings, to bring the matter to a short issue, in his own way.”\r\nCertain it is, however, that Dr. Rittenhouse reprobated, as did his\r\neminent predecessor just named, that subtile, vague and inconclusive\r\nkind of ratiocination, the mode of reasoning, in matters of abstract\r\nscience, from causes to effects,[358] which so much characterize that\r\n“cobweb philosophy,”[359] of which the mass of mere metaphysical systems\r\nis made up. Rittenhouse was a practical philosopher: he held in contempt\r\nthe obscurity of mysticism, in every object of rational enquiry; viewing\r\nit as being, always, either the parent or the offspring of error. He\r\nloved “sober certainty,”[360] in philosophy; and therefore he pursued\r\nTruth, in all his scientific researches, in that practical and rational\r\nmode of philosophizing, which he deemed conformable to the nature of\r\ntruth itself, and best adapted to the construction and faculties of the\r\nhuman mind.[361]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 358:\r\n\r\n           “Let others creep by timid steps, and slow,\r\n           On plain experience, lay foundations low;\r\n           By common sense, to common knowledge bred;\r\n           And lost to nature’s cause through nature led:\r\n           All-seeing in thy mists, we want no guide,\r\n           Mother of Arrogance and source of pride!\r\n           We nobly take the high priori road,\r\n           And reason downward, till we doubt of GOD.”\r\n                               _Pope’s Dunciad_, b. IV. l. 455.\r\n\r\n  The following observation, in the form of a note, is referred to, from\r\n  the lines above quoted, in a work which contains that extract, viz.\r\n  “Those, who, from the effects in this visible world, deduce the\r\n  eternal power and Godhead of the first cause, though they cannot\r\n  attain to an adequate idea of the Deity, yet discover so much of him,\r\n  as enables them to see the end of their creation and the means of\r\n  their happiness: whereas they who take “the high priori road,” as\r\n  Hobbes, Spinoza, Descartes, and some better reasoners, for one that\r\n  goes right, ten lose themselves in “mists,” or ramble after visions,\r\n  which deprive them of all sight of their end, and mislead them in the\r\n  choice of wrong means.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Pope had put the above poetical lines into the mouth of one of his\r\n  Dunces, when addressing himself to the goddess Dullness. And as the\r\n  great Dr. Samuel Clarke had previously endeavoured to shew,[358a] that\r\n  the Being of a God may be demonstrated by arguments deduced _â\r\n  priori_, the Doctor conceived himself to be struck at, among those\r\n  “better reasoners” alluded to, in the note above mentioned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 358a:\r\n\r\n  In his work entitled, “A Discourse concerning the Being and Attributes\r\n  of a God, the Obligations of Natural Religion, and the truth and\r\n  certainty of the Christian Revelation; in answer to Mr. Hobbes,\r\n  Spinoza, the Author of the Oracles of Reason, and other deniers of\r\n  natural and revealed Religion.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 359:\r\n\r\n  See Ritt. Orat.\r\n\r\nFootnote 360:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 361:\r\n\r\n  “Other systems of Philosophy have ever found it necessary to conceal\r\n  their weakness and inconsistency, under the veil of unintelligible\r\n  terms and phrases, to which no two mortals, perhaps, ever affixed the\r\n  same meaning. But the philosophy of Newton disdains to make use of\r\n  such subterfuges; it is not reduced to the necessity of using them,\r\n  because it pretends not to be of nature’s privy council, or to have\r\n  access to her most inscrutable mysteries; but, to attend carefully to\r\n  her works, to discover the immediate causes of visible effects, to\r\n  trace those causes to others more general and simple, advancing by\r\n  slow and sure steps towards the Great First Cause of all things.”\r\n  Ritt. Orat.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhat was the general bias of Dr. Rittenhouse’s opinions on the subject\r\nof government, no one who knew him could doubt; and they are likewise\r\ndeducible, not only from his writings, but from the uniform course of\r\nhis public and official conduct. He was, in fact, from the dawn of the\r\nAmerican controversy with the government of the mother-country to the\r\nyear 1775, a whig, in his political principles. From the commencement of\r\nhostilities in that year, his feelings, as a native of America,\r\nprejudiced him strongly against the administration of the British\r\ngovernment; and the prejudices thus imbibed, were transferred, soon\r\nafter, from those men who administered that government—as well as their\r\nmeasures, to the nature and form of the government itself. And finally,\r\non the establishment of the national independence of the United States,\r\nin 1776, his opinions settled down, very decidedly, in favour of the\r\ngovernmental system of a representative and elective republic.\r\n\r\nBut, until the arrival of that important epocha, when thirteen\r\nNorth-American colonies of Great Britain solemnly announced to the world\r\ntheir separation from the parent-state, Rittenhouse thought and acted,\r\nin relation to political affairs, pretty much as his countrymen did.\r\n“Previous to the American revolution,” as Ramsay the historian has\r\nremarked, “the inhabitants of the British colonies were universally\r\nloyal:” and another American writer[362] of respectability has\r\ncorrespondently observed, that the proceedings of the first congress\r\nwere “cool, deliberate and loyal, though marked with unanimity and\r\nfirmness.” Indeed many months elapsed, after the appeal to arms was\r\nactually made, before the strong attachment to the mother-country, which\r\nthe American colonists had always manifested, generally subsided. But,\r\nafter the middle of the year 1775, “the prejudices in favour of a\r\nconnexion with England and of the English constitution,” (to use the\r\nwords of Chief-Justice Marshall,[363] “gradually, but rapidly wore off;\r\nand were succeeded by republican principles, and wishes for\r\nindependence.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 362:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Morse, the Geographer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 363:\r\n\r\n  See his _Life of George Washington_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch then, it is confidently believed, was the progress of political\r\nsentiments in their operation upon the mind of Rittenhouse, in common\r\nwith a large majority of the American people.\r\n\r\nThe information must therefore have been wholly erroneous, upon which\r\nDr. Rush was induced to ground his assertion, that “the year of the\r\ndeclaration of Independence, which changed our royal governments into\r\nrepublics, produced no change in his (Rittenhouse’s) political\r\nopinions,—for,” continues the Doctor, “he had been educated a republican\r\nby his father.” The very reason which the able and zealous Eulogist has\r\nhere assigned for Dr. Rittenhouse’s political principles having\r\nundergone no change in consequence of the American revolution, being\r\npredicated upon an assumed but mistaken fact, it serves to invalidate\r\nthat allegation; and it would never have been made, had not Dr. Rush\r\nbeen led into the error by misinformation on the subject. Because, those\r\nwho were personally acquainted with our Philosopher’s father, (Mr.\r\nMatthias Rittenhouse,) must well know, that the old gentleman was\r\nremarkable for his quiet, unoffending principles and conduct; that he\r\nmeddled very little, if at all, with public affairs; and that, although\r\na man of good judgment, he had never turned his attention to political\r\ncontroversies or speculations on the science of government. He was in\r\ntruth a pious man, of great industry, plain manners and unambitious\r\ntemper; and he uniformly approved himself a peaceable and faithful\r\nsubject of that monarchy under which he lived seventy-three years, until\r\n1776. On the other hand, the theory of government was a subject upon\r\nwhich the son had, doubtless, thought and read much. It cannot,\r\ntherefore, be reasonably concluded, that Dr. Rittenhouse was “educated a\r\nrepublican by his father.”\r\n\r\nIt is asked: “How could he (Rittenhouse) behold the beauty and harmony\r\nof the universe as the result of universal and mutual dependance, and\r\nnot admit that Heaven intended Rulers to be dependant upon those, for\r\nwhose benefit, alone, all government should exist? To suppose the\r\ncontrary,” it is added, “would be to deny unity and system in the plans\r\nof the great Creator of all things.”[364] But, with all due deference to\r\nthe genius and talents of the highly respectable gentleman here quoted,\r\nthe writer cannot persuade himself, that our Astronomer could have drawn\r\nsuch inferences as the results of analogical reasoning, from the beauty\r\nand harmony of the Universe, as those which the foregoing extract would\r\nseem to impute to him. For, who are those, “for whose benefit, alone,\r\nall government should exist?” The People: And in such a republic as the\r\nUnited States—where there cannot exist, _constitutionally_, “a\r\nprivileged order of men”—the Rulers are, surely, a part of the People.\r\nWhat, then, is the nature of this mutuality of dependence between Rulers\r\nand People? If government should exist for the benefit of the People,\r\nthat is, all the members of the community, as most assuredly it ought to\r\ndo; then it should be conducted for the benefit of the Rulers, as well\r\nas of those who are ruled; the former being a component part of the\r\nentire community, under the comprehensive denomination of the People. It\r\nis therefore conceived, that, on republican principles, the People and\r\ntheir Rulers cannot be so contradistinguished as separate bodies of men,\r\nas that the former, alone, should be dependant on the latter; but that\r\nthere ought to be between them, as constituting jointly and collectively\r\nthe People, that “mutual dependance,” of which the ingenious Eulogist\r\nspeaks: otherwise, a privileged order of men must be considered as\r\nactually existing among us. Yet, even in the monarchical republic of\r\nGreat Britain,[365] the business of government is not wholly “limited”\r\nto “a privileged order of men:”[366] One branch of the legislative body\r\nis popular; and one branch, also, of the judicial department of that\r\ngovernment, the institution of juries, is purely republican.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 364:\r\n\r\n  See the Eulogium on Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 365:\r\n\r\n  The names ordinarily used to distinguish things, do not always truly\r\n  denote the nature of the things they are designed to signify: and it\r\n  is very evident, that any misapplication of a name, to which a\r\n  specific meaning has been appropriated, cannot alter or otherwise\r\n  affect the essence or inherent quality of the thing itself to which it\r\n  is wrongly applied.\r\n\r\n  A nation may be a republic, notwithstanding its chief executive\r\n  magistrate be denominated a king. A kingly government may be\r\n  essentially republican, provided the people be governed by known laws,\r\n  and their king be limited in his prerogative, by the constitution of\r\n  the state; not such a monarch as is vested with uncontrouled power. In\r\n  this sense, the British government may, as some modern writers have\r\n  shewn, be called a commonwealth, or republic: and under a similar\r\n  impression, Sir Thomas Smith, even in the reign of so rigid a prince\r\n  as Henry VIII. wrote his book _De Republicâ Anglicanâ_. The republic\r\n  of Poland was long governed by elective kings; and Shakespeare, (nay,\r\n  even the leveller Godwin,[365a]) appears to have considered Monarch,\r\n  King and President, as synonymous terms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 365a:\r\n\r\n  The Memorialist can truly say, with the author of the _Pursuits of\r\n  Literature_:—“I have given some attention to Mr. Godwin’s work on\r\n  _Political Justice_, as conceiving it to be the code of improved\r\n  modern ethics, morality, and legislation. I confess I looked not for\r\n  the Republic of Plato, or even for the Oceana of Harrington; but for\r\n  something different from them all. I looked, indeed, for a\r\n  superstructure raised on the revolutionary ground of Equality, watered\r\n  with the Guillotine; and such I found it.” See _Pursuits of\r\n  Literature_, Dial. the third, note p. of the seventh Lond. edit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 366:\r\n\r\n  “It belongs to monarchies,” says Dr. Rush, “to limit the business of\r\n  government to a privileged order of men.” See _Eulog._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe learned professor, here referred to, is nevertheless an highly\r\nestimable citizen of the American Republic, as his numerous and\r\nimportant public services fully evince. In his “Address to the People of\r\nthe United States,” published shortly before the sitting of the Federal\r\nConvention, he has pointed out two “errors or prejudices on the subject\r\nof government in America, which,” as he very justly observes, “lead to\r\nthe most dangerous consequences.” The correctness of his sentiments on\r\nthe subject of those errors, does him honour: such of his observations\r\nas are more particularly applicable to the present subject, are\r\ncontained in the following passages.\r\n\r\n“It is often said, that ‘the sovereign power and all other power is\r\nseated in the people.’ This idea is unhappily expressed. It should\r\nbe—‘all power is derived from the people.’ They possess it only on the\r\ndays of their elections. After this, it is the property of their Rulers;\r\nnor can they exercise or resume it, unless it is abused. It is of\r\nimportance to circulate this idea, as it tends to order and good\r\ngovernment.” And again:\r\n\r\n“The people of America have mistaken the meaning of the word\r\nSovereignty: hence, each State pretends to be sovereign. In Europe, it\r\nis applied only to those states, which possess the power of making war\r\nand peace, of forming treaties, and the like. As this power belongs only\r\nto Congress, they are the only sovereign power in the United States.”\r\n\r\nThe Memorialist is persuaded, that Dr. Rittenhouse would have fully\r\nconcurred in this construction of the nature of sovereignty, in an\r\nelective government: and he has been the more diffuse on this subject,\r\nin order both to prevent and remove, as much as possible, any\r\nmisconceptions respecting the political opinions of our Philosopher.\r\n\r\nAn unostentatious simplicity and strict integrity, with a due proportion\r\nof dignity and firmness, in the administration of the public affairs; a\r\njudicious economy, in the management and expenditure of the public\r\nrevenues; a zealous attention to the public interests and the happiness\r\nof the people; a wise and faithful administration of justice among the\r\nvarious members of the community, without any invidious distinctions; a\r\nstrict observance of good faith, in all relations with foreign states; a\r\nsincere attachment to peace with its concomitant blessings, and\r\nconsequently, an abhorrence of unnecessary wars, whether provoked, or\r\nundertaken, by means of the cupidity or the ambition of rulers; these\r\nhave been usually considered, in theory, as characteristics of\r\nrepublican governments. Greatly is it to be desired, that they may\r\nalways prove to be so, in fact.\r\n\r\nThat both the Rittenhouses, father and son, should be attached to an\r\norder of things in the commonwealth, established and conducted on the\r\nprinciples just mentioned, may be readily conceived from a knowledge of\r\ntheir characters. To a system of civil polity, productive of such\r\nsubstantial benefits to all those under its immediate operation, Dr.\r\nRittenhouse would naturally have been inclined: his habits, manners and\r\nprinciples, would so dispose him. Hence, after having indulged, for a\r\nmoment, the pleasing but fanciful hypothesis, that if the inhabitants of\r\nthe other planets resemble man in their faculties and affections; if,\r\nlike him, they were created liable to fall, though some of them might be\r\npresumed to retain their original rectitude; he proceeds with supposing,\r\n“that they are wise enough to govern themselves according to the\r\ndictates of that reason which God has given them, in such manner as to\r\nconsult their own and each other’s happiness, upon all occasions. But\r\nif, on the contrary,” said he, “they have found it necessary to erect\r\nartificial fabrics of government, let us not suppose they have done it\r\nwith so little skill, and at such an enormous expence, as to render them\r\na misfortune, instead of a blessing. We will hope,” continues the\r\nphilanthropic Rittenhouse, “that their statesmen are patriots, and that\r\ntheir kings, if that order of beings has found admittance there, have\r\nthe feelings of humanity.” He next deplores, in terms which evince the\r\nstrength of his feelings on the occasion, the folly as well as iniquity\r\nof holding the Africans in bondage among us; national rapacity; the\r\nscourges of war, then recently inflicted on the north of Europe; and,\r\nfinally, he deprecates in very impressive language, the inroads of\r\n“luxury, and her constant follower, tyranny.”[367]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 367:\r\n\r\n  See Ritt. Orat. before the Am. Philos. Soc. in 1775.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse having entertained such sentiments as these, at the time\r\nhe penned his Oration, and it will be recollected, that this was only\r\ntwo or three months before hostilities had actually taken place between\r\nGreat-Britain and her North-American Colonies, he was naturally enough\r\ninduced to believe, that many of the political evils which were, about\r\nthat period, experienced in civil society by a large portion of mankind,\r\narose from the nature of their respective governments. And, the\r\nprincipal states of Europe, with the exception of the Dutch\r\ncommonwealth, were then governed under the monarchical form.\r\n\r\nIn the American continental colonies of Great-Britain, generally, it was\r\nthe prevalent opinion of the people at the commencement of the\r\nrevolution, that the grievances complained of by the colonists,\r\noriginated, almost as a matter of necessity, from the monarchical spirit\r\nof the mother-country: consequently, many of those great public evils\r\nwhich sprung from the genius, habits and pursuits, of the people\r\nthemselves, in the great monarchies of the old world, were generally\r\nattributed to some peculiar vices inherent in that species of\r\ngovernment. It was the universality, almost, of these opinions; which\r\nsoon after obtained throughout the United Colonies, that produced a\r\ndetermination in the people to establish, for themselves, republican\r\nforms of government, as independent states. Such were accordingly\r\nestablished; and the American people have long experienced their\r\nefficiency in promoting the prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nShould it, nevertheless, unfortunately happen at any future period, that\r\nthe now existing national constitution should, by any means, be\r\nperverted from its original design; should a system of government so\r\nwell planned—“in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice,\r\ninsure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, and secure\r\nthe blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity;”[368] should\r\nthis well-defined Charter of American freedom, by means of\r\nmal-administration or otherwise, eventually frustrate the patriotic\r\nintentions of its illustrious framers; then, indeed, will the noblest\r\neffort ever made by any people to institute a rational system of free\r\ngovernment, blast the best hopes of the advocates of republicanism. In\r\nsuch event—which, may heaven avert! the often quoted couplet would be\r\ntoo fatally verified, wherein the poet says:\r\n\r\n             “For forms of government let fools contest;\r\n             Whate’er is best administer’d, is best.”[369]\r\n                                     Pope’s _Essay on Man_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 368:\r\n\r\n  See the ordaining clause of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nFootnote 369:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Pope was not singular in the opinion here expressed: one of the\r\n  most illustrious legislators and best practical statesmen the world\r\n  has ever known, appears to have entertained the same sentiment, when\r\n  he penned the following passages: they are extracted from the _Frame\r\n  of Government_ originally designed by William Penn, for Pennsylvania:\r\n  published in the year 1682.\r\n\r\n  “Any government is free to the people under it (whatever be the\r\n  frame,) where the laws rule and the people are a party to those laws;\r\n  and more than this is tyranny, oligarchy, and confusion.”\r\n\r\n  “There is hardly one frame of government in the world so ill designed\r\n  by its first founders, that, in good hands, would not do well enough;\r\n  and story tells us, the best, in ill ones, can do nothing that is\r\n  great or good.” “I know,” continues Penn, “some say, Let us have good\r\n  laws, and no matter for the men that execute them: but let them\r\n  consider, that though good laws do well, good men do better: for good\r\n  laws may want good men, and be abolished or evaded by ill men; but\r\n  good men will never want good laws, nor suffer ill ones. It is here,\r\n  good laws have some awe upon ill ministers; but that is where they\r\n  have not power to escape or abolish them, and the people are generally\r\n  wise and good: but a loose and depraved people (which is to be the\r\n  question) love laws and an administration like themselves. That,\r\n  therefore, which makes a good constitution, must keep it, viz. men of\r\n  wisdom and virtue; qualities that, because they descend not with\r\n  worldly inheritances, must be carefully propagated by a virtuous\r\n  education of youth.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse was, undoubtedly, among those who entertained the most\r\nsanguine expectations, that the political institutions in the United\r\nStates, formed as they are according to the republican model, would tend\r\nto meliorate the condition of the people, and “promote the general\r\nwelfare.” He may at some time have even “believed political, as well as\r\nmoral evil, to be intruders into the society of men.”[370] But some\r\npassages in his Oration plainly shew, that, as has been already\r\nobserved, he had no faith in the perfectibility of human reason,[371] in\r\nthis life. He was also too sound a philosopher not to know, that if, by\r\nthe best rules of philosophical ratiocination, many well known phænomena\r\nin the natural world could not be reached, with respect to their nature\r\nand causes, in such manner as to render these susceptible of\r\ndemonstrative proof,—nothing like certainty in the result, much less\r\nperfection, could be calculated on, in putting the theories of a\r\nscience, such as government, to the test of experiment.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  See Dr. Rush’s Eulog. on Ritt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  About the middle of January, 1813, the Memorialist passed a very\r\n  pleasant evening, in company with an agreeable party of friends, at\r\n  the house of Dr. Rush. Among various subjects, which were then\r\n  discussed with much ingenuity and good humour, Redhefer’s pretended\r\n  discovery of what is called the Perpetual Motion, a thing which had\r\n  then, very recently, attracted a good deal of the public attention,\r\n  was brought upon the tapes: when Dr. Rush, addressing himself to the\r\n  Writer, who had just expressed his opinion decidedly against the\r\n  projector’s theory, as being utterly incompatible with established\r\n  principles of physics and well-known laws of the material world, said\r\n  quite emphatically; “Sir, I entirely agree with you: and let me\r\n  observe, there are four things, concerning which I have always been\r\n  completely sceptical, as I am sure your good uncle[371a] also was;\r\n  that is to say, the perfectibility of human reason; the possibility of\r\n  transmuting base metals into silver and gold; a panacea, in the\r\n  healing art; and a power, in any mortal, to give perpetuity of motion\r\n  to matter.” These were, substantially, the sentiments expressed by Dr.\r\n  Rush, on the occasion; and the Writer believes he is pretty accurate\r\n  in his recollection of the very words which the Doctor used.\r\n\r\nFootnote 371a:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf it be asked: ‘Where are the _Works_ of Rittenhouse?’ a ready and\r\nsatisfactory answer to the question is at hand. Although he published no\r\nponderous volumes, he has left behind him great and honourable memorials\r\nof his genius, his science and his skill; such as will long remain, as\r\nMonuments of the extraordinary extent of his practical usefulness in his\r\nday, and of his well-earned fame. “He has not indeed made a world,” as\r\nMr. Jefferson, in speaking of his Orrery, emphatically expresses\r\nhimself; “but he has, by imitation, approached nearer its Maker, than\r\nany man who has lived from the creation to this day.”[372] As long, too,\r\nas the geographical boundaries of Pennsylvania, connected in part with\r\nthose of the neighbouring states, shall continue to define the\r\nrespective jurisdictions of their local sovereignties and rights,\r\nconsidered as members of a great confederated nation; so long will they\r\nserve to distinguish the name of Rittenhouse.[373] Nay, some of the\r\nrivers and canals, even some principal roads, in the country of his\r\nnativity, bear testimony to his talents, his public spirit and his\r\nindustry. His inventions and improvements, in various specimens of\r\nmechanism, conceived and executed by himself, fully manifest, that, “as\r\nan artist, he has exhibited as great a proof of mechanical genius as the\r\nworld has ever produced.”[374] And, as a man of extensive and profound\r\nscience, his various philosophical papers, but more especially those\r\nrelating to his astronomical observations, justify Mr. Jefferson’s\r\nremark, that he was “second to no Astronomer living,”—that he was, “in\r\ngenius the first, because self-taught.”[375]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 372:\r\n\r\n  See _Notes on Virginia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  All the boundary-lines, mentioned above, were determined by\r\n  astronomical observations. The manner in which the work was performed,\r\n  with an account of the instruments used on those occasions, will be\r\n  found in the fourth volume of the Transactions of the American\r\n  Philosophical Society. Some of Dr. Rittenhouse’s associates, in those\r\n  arduous undertakings, were men of high reputation in the same\r\n  departments of science; but his talents were principally relied on.\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  See _Notes on Virginia_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 375:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the “Works” of this truly great man. And it appears\r\nthat they were, in general, not only arduous in their execution, and\r\nhighly beneficial in their uses and effects; but that they were likewise\r\nthe productions of a lofty, penetrating and active genius, great\r\nknowledge and skill, and the most indefatigable perseverance.[376]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 376:\r\n\r\n  It will, perhaps, have occurred to the reader, that besides such of\r\n  the WORKS of Dr. Rittenhouse, as are referred to in the text, in some\r\n  of which, the blended effects of genius, philosophical science and\r\n  mechanical skill, were equally conspicuous, he put the Mint into\r\n  operation. In the language of his worthy successor in the direction of\r\n  that institution, “his lofty and correct mind, capable alike of\r\n  ascending to the sublimest heights of science, and of condescending to\r\n  regulate the minute movements of mechanical machinery, organized the\r\n  Mint, and created the workmen and the apparatus.” His agency in\r\n  directing the construction, and arranging the operative departments,\r\n  of this important establishment, though less indicative of\r\n  extraordinary mechanical genius than many of his other works, was\r\n  nevertheless an arduous undertaking: it was conducted, as Mr. De\r\n  Saussure very justly observed, “amidst complicated difficulties, from\r\n  which the most persevering minds might have shrunk without dishonour.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut though Dr. Rittenhouse published no great systematic literary work,\r\nhe communicated to others by his conversation, and by such of his\r\nwritings as have been given to the world, much valuable philosophical\r\ninformation. He instructed, liberally, such persons as were desirous of\r\nacquiring knowledge from a social intercourse with him. The elevated\r\nstation his character maintained, both for wisdom and integrity,\r\nexhibited him to his cotemporaries as an example worthy of being\r\nimitated:[377] and thus, in reality, his high reputation operated as a\r\npowerful incitement upon many of his countrymen, to pursue similar\r\nobjects of science, inspiring them with a taste to cultivate the true\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 377:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Rush, in his Eulogium on Rittenhouse, has introduced a short\r\n  invocation, which aptly applies in this place: it is in these words;\r\n  “Come, and learn by his example to be good, as well as great. His\r\n  virtues furnish the most shining models for your imitation; for they\r\n  were never obscured by a single cloud of weakness or vice.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe reputation of this distinguished man, as a mathematician and\r\nastronomer, was pre-eminently great, in every civilized part of the\r\nwestern world. Perhaps no man’s philosophical talents were ever held in\r\nhigher estimation, nor more deservedly so, by those qualified to form a\r\nproper judgment of them, wherever his name was known; not excepting\r\nthose of Newton himself. His celebrity was far from being confined\r\nwithin the limits of his native country: his Orrery, with the\r\nproceedings and results of the Observation of that phænomenon which so\r\ngreatly interested the principal astronomers of both hemispheres, the\r\nTransit of Venus in 1769, had rendered him justly celebrated in Europe\r\nas well as America, as a philosopher of the highest grade, at the age of\r\nthirty-seven years.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar circumstances of his Life, which have been amply detailed\r\nin these Memoirs, were of such a nature as to preclude him, in a great\r\nmeasure, from opportunities of carrying on a correspondence with men of\r\nscience and letters, abroad: the extremely delicate, and oftentimes\r\ninfirm state of his general health, in addition to his numerous\r\navocations, his long continued, various, and important employments in\r\nthe public service, left him little leisure for literary pursuits of any\r\nkind. Indeed, nothing less than the wonderful energy of his mind, and\r\nhis extraordinary industry, could have enabled him to write as much as\r\nhe has done.[378]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 378:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall makes an observation, in reference to\r\n  General Washington, which applies with equal force to Dr. Rittenhouse.\r\n  “To estimate rightly his worth, we must contemplate his difficulties:\r\n  we must examine the means placed in his hands, and the use he made of\r\n  those means.” Pref. to Marshall’s _Life of Washington_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDr. Rittenhouse never attempted to amuse the world with any hypothetical\r\nsystem of philosophy, or with opinions, merely speculative, on any\r\nsubject. The great objects of his pursuits, through life, were Certainty\r\nand Truth: hence, he never advanced an opinion, concerning any thing\r\nwhatever, which he did not consider as being either susceptible of\r\nverification by experiment and the evidence of our senses, or, where the\r\nnature of the subject did not admit of such proof, capable of being\r\ntested by the soundest principles of human reason. Yet, though this\r\nprofound investigator of nature viewed “sober certainty” as the great\r\ndesideratum in philosophy, he was by no means a dogmatist; even with\r\nrespect to that portion of natural science which is capable of\r\ndemonstration. Notwithstanding the opinion he entertained of the vast\r\nextent to which the faculties of the mind may be enlarged by a proper\r\nimprovement of them, he was fully aware that its powers are limited.\r\nLike his great predecessor, Maclaurin, “the farther he advanced in the\r\nknowledge of geometry and of nature, the greater his aversion grew to\r\nperfect systems, hypotheses, and dogmatizing: without peevishly\r\ndespising the attainments we can arrive at, or the uses to which they\r\nserve, he saw there lay infinitely more beyond our reach.” Like him,\r\nalso, he considered “our highest discoveries as being but a dawn of\r\nknowledge, suited to our circumstances and wants in this life; which,\r\nhowever, we ought thankfully to acquiesce in, for the present, in hopes\r\nthat it will be improved in a happier and more perfect state.”[379]\r\nRittenhouse never supposed, that, (to use the words of Maclaurin’s\r\nbiographer[380]), “because demonstrative evidence is the most perfect,\r\nit should be—as, by some, it has been—taken for granted, there is no\r\nother.” On the contrary, our philosopher believed that there are many\r\ntruths, natural as well as moral, which are beyond the reach of\r\ndemonstration; consequently, not to be rejected, solely by reason of\r\ntheir insusceptibility of this kind of proof. Hence, in his Oration he\r\nsays, “Our Religion teaches us what Philosophy could not have taught;\r\nand we ought to admire, with reverence, the great things it has pleased\r\nDivine Providence to perform, beyond the ordinary course of nature, for\r\nman, who is undoubtedly the most noble inhabitant of this globe. But,”\r\ncontinues this truly good man, “neither Religion nor Philosophy forbid\r\nus to believe, that infinite Wisdom and Power, prompted by infinite\r\nGoodness, may, throughout the vast extent of creation and duration, have\r\nfrequently interposed in a manner quite incomprehensible to us, when it\r\nbecame necessary to the happiness of created beings of some other rank\r\nor degree.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Maclaurin having noticed that the Author of Nature has made it\r\n  impossible for us to have any communication, from this earth, with the\r\n  other great bodies of the universe, in our present state; and after\r\n  remarking on some phænomena in the planetary system, makes the\r\n  following just reflections, which correspond with those expressed by\r\n  Dr. Rittenhouse, in the concluding pages of his Oration:—“From hence,\r\n  as well as from the state of the moral world and many other\r\n  considerations, we are induced to believe, that our present state\r\n  would be very imperfect without a subsequent one; wherein our views of\r\n  nature, and of its great Author, may be more clear and satisfactory.\r\n  It does not appear to be suitable to the wisdom that shines throughout\r\n  all nature, to suppose that we should see so far, and have our\r\n  curiosity so much raised concerning the works of God, only to be\r\n  disappointed in the end. As man is undoubtedly the chief being upon\r\n  this globe, and this globe may be no less considerable, in the most\r\n  valuable respects, than any other in the solar system, and this\r\n  system, for ought we know, not inferior to any other in the universal\r\n  system; so, if we should suppose man to perish, without ever arriving\r\n  at a more complete knowledge of nature, than the very imperfect one he\r\n  attains in his present state; by analogy, or parity of reason, we\r\n  might conclude, that the like desires would be frustrated in the\r\n  inhabitants of all the other planets and systems; and that the\r\n  beautiful scheme of nature would never be unfolded, but in an\r\n  exceedingly imperfect manner, to any of them. This, therefore,\r\n  naturally leads us to consider our present state as only the dawn or\r\n  beginning of our existence, and as a state of preparation or probation\r\n  for farther advancement: which appears to have been the opinion of the\r\n  most judicious philosophers of old. And whoever attentively considers\r\n  the constitution of human nature, particularly the desires and\r\n  passions of men, which appear greatly superior to their present\r\n  objects, will easily be persuaded that man was designed for higher\r\n  views than of this life. Surely, it is in His power to grant us a far\r\n  greater improvement of the faculties we already possess, or even to\r\n  endow us with new faculties, of which, at this time, we have no idea,\r\n  for penetrating farther into the scheme of nature, and approaching\r\n  nearer to Himself, the First and Supreme Cause.”\r\n\r\n  The striking coincidence of the foregoing sentiments, with those\r\n  expressed by Dr. Rittenhouse; in addition to the sublimity of the\r\n  conceptions; the cogency of the argument; and the weight of the\r\n  concurring opinions of two so great astronomers and mathematicians, on\r\n  a subject of such high importance to mankind; all plead an apology for\r\n  the length of this extract, from Maclaurin’s Account of Sir Isaac\r\n  Newton’s Philosophical Discoveries.\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  Patrick Murdoch, M.A.F.R.S.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch were the pious reflections of a Christian Philosopher; the sublime\r\nsentiments of an eminently distinguished Astronomer.\r\n\r\nShould it be enquired: What was the system of Philosophy, to which Dr.\r\nRittenhouse adhered? though such a question can scarcely be anticipated,\r\nafter what has been already said; the answer may be furnished in a few\r\nwords: He was a thorough and zealous disciple of the Newtonian school.\r\nHe early embraced, and perseveringly cultivated, “the Philosophy of\r\nNewton;” which “disdains to make use of subterfuges,” which “is not\r\nreduced to the necessity of using them, because it pretends not to be of\r\nnature’s privy council;” while “other systems of philosophy have ever\r\nfound it necessary to conceal their weakness and inconsistency, under\r\nthe veil of unintelligible terms and phrases, to which no two mortals\r\nperhaps ever affixed the same meaning.”[381]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  The words between inverted commas, in the above paragraph, are quoted\r\n  from Rittenhouse’s Oration.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding the fanciful theories introduced into physics by\r\n  Descartes, concerning his _materia subtilis_ and _vortices_, and his\r\n  doctrine of a _plenum_, which were prostrated by the general adoption\r\n  of the Newtonian system, the improvements that had been made in the\r\n  mathematical sciences and some other branches of physics, by the\r\n  Cartesian system, produced a great revolution in the species of\r\n  philosophy which till then prevailed. The philosophy of Descartes,\r\n  erroneous and defective as, in some particulars, it was found to be,\r\n  triumphed, by its superior energy, over the crude and feeble systems\r\n  of the schools. The peripatetic doctrines which had revived in Europe,\r\n  after she emerged from the barbarism and gloom that succeeded the\r\n  final declension of the Roman empire, continued from that period to be\r\n  the prevailing philosophy; and tinctured, also, the whole mass of the\r\n  scholastic theology: but the systems of Descartes first dissipated\r\n  most of the useless subtleties of the schoolmen; while the truths\r\n  brought to light by the philosophy of Newton, still further exposed\r\n  their absurdities. According to Dr. Reid (in his _Essays on the\r\n  intellectual and active powers of Man_,) even the most useful and\r\n  intelligible parts of the writings of Aristotle himself had, among\r\n  them, become neglected; and philosophy was reduced to an art of\r\n  speaking learnedly and disputing subtilely, without producing any\r\n  invention of utility in the affairs of human life. “It was,” to use\r\n  the language of Dr. Reid, “fruitful in words, but barren of works; and\r\n  admirably contrived for drawing a veil over human ignorance, and\r\n  putting a stop to the progress of knowledge, by filling men with a\r\n  conceit that they knew every thing. It was very fruitful also in\r\n  controversies; but, for the most part, they were controversies about\r\n  words, or things above the reach of the human faculties.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWith Newton, too, our Philosopher entertained the most exalted\r\nconceptions of the Deity. He did not imagine, as his illustrious\r\npredecessor was unjustly charged with having done, that infinite space\r\nis an attribute of the Deity; that He is present in all parts of space,\r\nby diffusion;[382] but, like that great man, he did believe, that the\r\nDeity endures from eternity to eternity, and is present from infinity to\r\ninfinity; yet that He is not eternity or infinity, space or duration.\r\nFor, says Dr. Rittenhouse, “Nothing can better demonstrate the immediate\r\npresence of the Deity in every part of space, whether vacant or occupied\r\nby matter, than Astronomy does. It was from an Astronomer St. Paul\r\nquoted that exalted expression, so often since repeated, ‘In God we\r\nlive, and move, and have our being.’”[383]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  The celebrated Dr. Samuel Johnson has remarked, that “Leibnitz\r\n  persisted in affirming that Newton called Space, _Censorium Numinis_,\r\n  notwithstanding he was corrected, and desired to observe that Newton’s\r\n  words were, QUASI _Censorium Numinis_. See Boswell’s _Journal of a\r\n  Tour to the Hebrides_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 383:\r\n\r\n  This concise, yet beautiful and expressive sentence, is contained in\r\n  St. Paul’s address to the Athenians, cited in the 17th chapter of the\r\n  Acts of the Apostles.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe terms of profound veneration, in which our Philosopher spoke, on all\r\noccasions, of the character of Newton, demonstrate most clearly his\r\ncomplete and undeviating attachment to the Principles of that\r\nastonishing man.[384] Indeed, he appears to have taken him as his model;\r\nand, certainly, he resembled him much, in many points of character.\r\nParallels have often been drawn between distinguished men; and in\r\ncomparatively a few instances, a strong resemblance has been discovered,\r\nin some prominent features of character, between two or more persons.\r\nYet the infinite variety of talent, that appears throughout the human\r\nrace; the almost incredible difference in the grades of intellectual\r\nendowment, distinguishing the sons of men from each other; and the\r\nadventitious circumstances peculiar to each individual, which either\r\ndirect or controul his conduct, and seem to mark his destiny in life;\r\nall these, taken together, produce such an endless diversity of\r\ncharacter in the species, as to render it impracticable, if not\r\nabsolutely impossible, to find any two men who greatly resemble each\r\nother in many particulars.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 384:\r\n\r\n  A strong proof of this veneration will be found in Dr. Rittenhouse’s\r\n  Oration, wherein he expresses himself in these remarkable words:—“It\r\n  was, I make no doubt, by a particular appointment of Providence, that\r\n  at this time the immortal Newton appeared.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere are, nevertheless, so many circumstances founded on natural\r\ncauses, that indicate an extraordinary similitude in the genius,\r\ndisposition and principles of Rittenhouse, and his great Prototype; so\r\nmany, moreover, of a singular nature, connected with events purely\r\nadventitious, wherein the condition, occupations and pursuits of these\r\nphilosophers, with other eventual relations depending wholly on\r\naccident, resembled each other; that an interesting parallel, between\r\nthem, might be attempted with no inconsiderable share of success.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these Memoirs, the Biographer of RITTENHOUSE has\r\nendeavoured to furnish a faithful representation of the Philosopher and\r\nof the Man. He was desirous of delineating his true character, in both\r\npoints of view; that the world may be enabled to make a just estimate of\r\nthe genius, the principles, and the conduct of a person, so celebrated\r\nin name. But, in order that the more correct judgment might be formed of\r\nhis virtues and talents, and of the services he has rendered to society,\r\nit became necessary to describe the sphere in which he moved; so far, at\r\nleast, as to present to view occasional sketches of the complexion of\r\nthe Times in which he lived, and of some of the more prominent\r\nCharacters who were his compatriots. The Memorialist has therefore\r\nconveyed to the mind of his reader some idea of the moral, political,\r\nand literary state of society, more particularly in the country of our\r\nPhilosopher’s residence, within the same period. This rendered it proper\r\nto notice the rise, nature, and progress of certain Institutions, upon\r\nwhich science and the arts, with many of the benefits of civil polity,\r\ngreatly depend; such as tend to diffuse useful knowledge throughout the\r\ncommunity, to promote the general weal, and to meliorate the condition\r\nof the great family of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed, that every individual in society is more\r\nor less closely connected with it, in various ways: and it is obvious,\r\nthat an eminent citizen, one, especially, standing in relations of a\r\npublic nature in the community of which he is a member, usually has his\r\nhistory and character so interwoven with those of his own times, that it\r\nis difficult to understand the former thoroughly, without possessing a\r\ncompetent knowledge of the latter. The Life of such a man as RITTENHOUSE\r\ncould not, therefore, in many respects, be either well comprehended or\r\nduly estimated, unless there had been connected with it some account of\r\nmen and things, to which his private pursuits and public employments\r\nwere, directly or indirectly, related.\r\n\r\nIn whatever light, then, a retrospective view of Dr. RITTENHOUSE’S\r\ncharacter may be taken, it will be found to present a model worthy of\r\nimitation. The mild and amiable virtues of domestic life, and similar\r\ndispositions in the intercourses of private society, decorated his whole\r\ndeportment, as a man and as a citizen; the more stern qualities of the\r\npatriot equally distinguished him as the friend of his native country,\r\nin all his public relations; while the principles of genuine\r\nphilanthrophy impressed his heart with feelings of the most extended\r\nbenevolence. In all these respects, nevertheless, some have equalled,\r\nthough few, if any, have surpassed him. But when, united to virtues and\r\ndispositions, such as these, the powerful genius, the extensive\r\nphilosophical talents and attainments, the self-acquired and\r\nextraordinary mechanical skill of Dr. RITTENHOUSE, shall also have been\r\nconsidered; it will be acknowledged, that the Memoirs of his Life,\r\ncommemorate a Man truly great. They recal to his surviving countrymen,\r\nand to their posterity, a remembrance of his excellence and usefulness;\r\npresenting to them such a specimen of worth and abilities, as is highly\r\ndeserving of being emulated. At the same time, they exhibit to the world\r\na faithful portrait of a Man, whose character had early acquired the\r\nwell-earned respect of the wise and good in other nations. During his\r\nlife, the name of RITTENHOUSE received due homage from some of the most\r\nillustrious Philosophers of Europe. In his own country, that name cannot\r\ncease to be venerated, so long as genius, science, and virtue, shall be\r\nheld in the high estimation to which they are entitled.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by a noble author[385] of the present day, “that\r\nthe decline of public spirit in matters of Taste, is a certain\r\nindication of political decay.” To whatever degree the justness of this\r\nobservation may extend, it will apply still more forcibly to any\r\ncountry, wherein a disregard, consequently a declension of learning,\r\nscience and moral virtue, is perceived. RITTENHOUSE lived in an eventful\r\nage. During a long period of his life, he witnessed a comparative\r\nsimplicity of manners and much integrity of character, among his\r\ncountrymen. He beheld a progressive course of useful knowledge, and an\r\nadvance in those arts and refinements of polished society, which\r\nminister as well to the rational enjoyments as to the conveniences of\r\nhuman life; and these he saw accompanied by almost every species of\r\npublic improvements, promoted by the liberal spirit of the people and\r\nfostered by the benign genius of the government. Our Philosopher\r\nhimself, one-and-twenty years before his death, in speaking of the rapid\r\nprogress his countrymen had then made in almost every species of social\r\nrefinements, made this remark: “We have made most surprising, I had\r\nalmost said unnatural, advances towards the meridian of glory.”[386] But\r\nthis good man dreaded even at that time, what he always most earnestly\r\ndeprecated, that Luxury would, ere long, follow in the train of an\r\nhighly cultivated state of manners and too sumptuous a style of living:\r\nfor, he considered an excess of such refinements as leading to that\r\ndepravity of morals which often accompanies “Luxury,” and, as he has\r\nexpressed it, “her constant follower, Tyranny.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  Lord Strangford, in his _Remarks on the Life and Writings of Camoens_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  See his Oration.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe gloomy anticipations, which he sometimes entertained, of a future\r\ndepression of the interests of learning in his native country, from such\r\ncauses, he lived not to see realized. There is, indeed, ground on which\r\na reasonable hope may be founded, that, notwithstanding the operation of\r\nsome inauspicious circumstances, in these times, occasioned by the\r\npresent distracted state of the political world, literature, science and\r\nthe arts, will yet be successfully cultivated in the United States of\r\nAmerica. Dr. RITTENHOUSE had the good fortune to live in an age when\r\nvirtue and talents were honoured; when abilities to serve the country,\r\nand an honest attachment to its best interests, were the surest\r\npassports to the public confidence and esteem. In the latter years of\r\nhis life, it was a source of great gratification to him to know that his\r\ncountry was prosperous; it being then in the full enjoyment of all the\r\narts of peace, and other blessings of a well-ordered society. He was\r\ngreatly respected and esteemed by his illustrious compatriot,\r\nWASHINGTON; whose magnanimity taught him to spurn with disdain all petty\r\nconsiderations, arising from such mere difference of opinion in the\r\nspeculations of politics, as could neither undermine the principles of a\r\nPatriot, nor affect the fidelity of an honest Man. Very many\r\ndistinguished men, besides, were his contemporaries; and by persons of\r\nthis description, almost universally, as well as by all his countrymen\r\nof every class, to whom his person or character was known, he was held\r\nin the highest estimation: indeed, few men ever enjoyed a larger share\r\nof the public regard.\r\n\r\nSome years after the decease of Dr. Rittenhouse, it was judged expedient\r\nto transfer his perishable remains from their first place of sepulture,\r\nto another: they were accordingly removed; and interred in the cemetery\r\nadjoining the Presbyterian church in Pine-street, Philadelphia, near the\r\nbody of his son-in-law, Mr. Sergeant. The grave of the celebrated\r\nAmerican Astronomer is enclosed, under a plain slab of marble, thus\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n                              IN MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n                           DAVID RITTENHOUSE,\r\n\r\n                         BORN APRIL 8th, 1732,\r\n\r\n                         DIED JUNE 26th; 1796;\r\n\r\n                                  AND\r\n\r\n                          HANNAH RITTENHOUSE,\r\n\r\n                               HIS WIFE,\r\n\r\n                         Who died October 15th,\r\n\r\n                                 1799,\r\n\r\n                             Aged 64 years.\r\n\r\nBut, although no costly tomb contains the ashes of this\r\neminently-distinguished Man; although no sculptured cenotaph, in any\r\npart of his country, blazons his genius or records his fame; and\r\nnotwithstanding the chisel of the statuary has never been employed in\r\nobedience to the public voice, to produce a permanent resemblance of his\r\ncountenance and figure; yet a monument of more durable nature than any\r\nof these, consecrates his virtues, his talents, and his usefulness. A\r\ngrateful remembrance of his modest worth is enshrined in the hearts of\r\nthe wise and the good of his own age and country; and the name of DAVID\r\nRITTENHOUSE will be every where perpetuated with veneration and renown,\r\namong the sons of science and the benefactors of mankind.\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n                ========================================\r\n\r\n                              AN ORATION,\r\n                      DELIVERED FEBRUARY 24, 1775,\r\n                                 BEFORE\r\n                  THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,\r\n                         HELD AT PHILADELPHIA,\r\n                    FOR PROMOTING USEFUL KNOWLEDGE.\r\n                      BY DAVID RITTENHOUSE, A. M.\r\n                      MEMBER OF THE SAID SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                              (INSCRIBED)\r\n\r\nTo the Delegates of the thirteen United Colonies, assembled in Congress,\r\n  at Philadelphia, to whom the future liberties, and consequently the\r\n  virtue, improvement in science and happiness, of America, are\r\n  intrusted, the following Oration is inscribed and dedicated, by their\r\n  most obedient and humble servant, the Author.\r\n\r\n                ========================================\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nIt was not without being sensible how very unequal I am to the\r\nundertaking, that I first consented to comply with the request of\r\nseveral gentlemen for whom I have the highest esteem, and to solicit\r\nyour attention on a subject which an able hand might indeed render both\r\nentertaining and instructive; I mean Astronomy. But the earnest desire I\r\nhave to contribute something towards the improvement of Science in\r\ngeneral, and particularly of Astronomy, in this my native country,\r\njoined with the fullest confidence that I shall be favoured with your\r\nmost candid indulgence, however far I may fall short of doing justice to\r\nthe noble subject, enables me chearfully to take my turn as a member of\r\nthe society, on this annual occasion.\r\n\r\nThe order I shall observe in the following discourse, is this: In the\r\nfirst place I shall give a very short account of the rise and progress\r\nof astronomy, then take notice of some of the most important discoveries\r\nthat have been made in this science, and conclude with pointing out a\r\nfew of its defects at the present time.\r\n\r\nAs, on this occasion, it is not necessary to treat my subject in a\r\nstrictly scientific way, I shall hazard some conjectures of my own;\r\nwhich, if they have but novelty to recommend them, may perhaps be more\r\nacceptable than retailing the conjectures of others.\r\n\r\nThe first rise of astronomy, like the beginnings of other sciences, is\r\nlost in the obscurity of ancient times. Some have attributed its origin\r\nto that strong propensity mankind have discovered, in all ages, for\r\nprying into futurity; supposing that astronomy was cultivated only as\r\nsubservient to judicial astrology. Others with more reason suppose\r\nastrology to have been the spurious offspring of astronomy; a\r\nsupposition that does but add one more to the many instances of human\r\ndepravity, which can convert the best things to the worst purposes.\r\n\r\nThe honour of first cultivating astronomy has been ascribed to the\r\nChaldeans, the Egyptians, the Arabians, and likewise to the Chinese;[A1]\r\namongst whom, it is pretended, astronomical observations are to be found\r\nof almost as early a date as the flood. But little credit is given to\r\nthese reports of the Jesuits, who it is thought were imposed on by the\r\nnatives; or else perhaps from motives of vanity, they have departed a\r\nlittle from truth, in their accounts of a country and people among whom\r\nthey were the chief European travellers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A1:\r\n\r\n  The reader will find a very learned and interesting dissertation on\r\n  the astronomy of these and other nations of antiquity, in Lalande’s\r\n  _Astronomie_, liv. ii. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNot to mention the prodigious number of years in which it is said the\r\nChaldeans observed the heavens, I pass on to what carries the appearance\r\nof more probability;[A2] the report that when Alexander took Babylon,\r\nastronomical observations for one thousand nine hundred years before\r\nthat time were found there, and sent from thence to Aristotle. But we\r\ncannot suppose those observations to have been of much value; for we do\r\nnot find that any use was ever after made of them.[A3]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A2:\r\n\r\n  Our orator might well pass on, without noticing more particularly the\r\n  fabulous annals of the Chaldeans. They assigned to the reigns of their\r\n  ten dynasties, 432 thousand years: and Lalande observes, that this\r\n  number, 432, augmented by two or by four noughts, frequently occurs in\r\n  antiquity. This prodigious number of years expresses, according to the\r\n  notions of the inhabitants of India, the duration of the life of a\r\n  symbolical cow: in the first age, this cow, serving as a vehicle for\r\n  innocence and virtue, advances with a firm step upon the earth,\r\n  supported by her four feet; in the second, or silver age, she becomes\r\n  somewhat enfeebled, and walks on only three feet; during the brazen,\r\n  or third age, she is reduced to the necessity of walking on two;\r\n  finally, during the iron age, she drags herself along; and, after\r\n  having lost, successively, all her legs, she recovers them in the\r\n  succeeding period, all of them being reproduced in the same order.\r\n\r\n  The Bramins thus make up their fabulous chronological account of the\r\n  age of the world; viz.\r\n\r\n        The duration of the first age,          1,728,000 years\r\n        The second                              1,296,000  do.\r\n        The third                                 864,000  do.\r\n        The fourth will continue                  432,000  do.\r\n                                                —————————\r\n        Making the total duration of the world  4,320,000 years.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lalande remarks, that these four ages have a relation to the\r\n  numbers 4, 3, 2, 1, which seem to announce some other thing than an\r\n  historical division. Therefore, to give this fabulous duration of the\r\n  world some semblance of truth. Mr. Bailly[A2a] rejects, in the first\r\n  place, the fourth age, of which, at present, (that is, when Lalande\r\n  wrote,) only 4887 years have passed: the residue of this duration\r\n  could not be considered by Bailly as any thing more than a reverie:\r\n  and as for the three first ages, he takes the years for days; in order\r\n  to shew, that, in reality, they reckoned by days, before they computed\r\n  by solar years. By these means, Bailly has reduced the pretensions of\r\n  the people of India to 12,000 years; and he identifies this\r\n  calculation for the Indians with that of the Persians, who give,\r\n  likewise, 12,000 years for the duration of the world. The accordance\r\n  thus produced in the two chronologies, seemed to Bailly to strengthen\r\n  the authenticity of the recital; and makes it appear, that these\r\n  notions prevailed alike among the Egyptians and the Chinese.\r\n\r\n  Such are the data, such the calculations, and such the reasoning of\r\n  Mr. Bailly, on this subject.\r\n\r\n  But, although Mr. Lalande has noticed the retrograde series of the\r\n  progressive numbers (1,) 2, 3, 4, in the Asiatic account of the age of\r\n  the world, a kind of mysterious constitution of the amount of the\r\n  years, in the several ages which make up the entire sum of its\r\n  duration, seems to have escaped the observation of that acute\r\n  philosopher; and probably the same circumstance passed also unnoticed\r\n  by Mr. Bailly: it may be considered as a species of chronological\r\n  _abracadabra_, engendered in the prolific brain of some eastern\r\n  philosopher: the following is the circumstance here meant. It will be\r\n  perceived, in the first place, that the arrangement of the numerical\r\n  figures, in making up the years allotted to the fourth age of the\r\n  world, is apparently artificial, and therefore, probably, altogether\r\n  arbitrary. It will then be seen, that the number of years in the third\r\n  age is double the amount of those in the fourth; that those in the\r\n  second is made up by adding together the years in the fourth and third\r\n  ages; and, that those in the first age are constituted by an addition\r\n  of the number of years in the fourth and second ages. This being the\r\n  fact, it does not seem to bear out Mr. Bailly, in his hypothesis, and\r\n  the calculations founded on it. W. B.\r\n\r\nFootnote A2a:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Bailly was the author of a _History of Ancient and modern\r\n  Astronomy_. His _Essay on the Theory of Jupiter’s Satellites_, which\r\n  is said to be a valuable treatise, was published in the year 1766.\r\n  Both works are in the French language, and were printed in France.\r\n\r\nFootnote A3:\r\n\r\n  Lalande observes that Mr. Bailly has gone back, in his astronomical\r\n  researches, to the first traditions of an antedeluvian people, among\r\n  whom there remained scarcely any traces of such knowledge; and that he\r\n  has presented us, in his work, with ingenious conjectures and\r\n  probabilities; or, more properly, appearances of truth,\r\n  (“vraisemblables,”) written with many charms of extensive information.\r\n  But, according to Mr. Lalande himself, all the ancient astronomy down\r\n  to the time of Chiron, which was about fourteen centuries before the\r\n  Christian era, may with probability be reduced to the examining of the\r\n  rising of some stars at different times of the year, and the phases of\r\n  the moon; since, long after that period, as this great astronomer\r\n  remarks, the Chaldeans and Egyptians yet knew nothing of either the\r\n  duration or the inequalities of the planetary movements. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians too, we are told, had observations of the stars for one\r\nthousand five hundred years before the Christian era. What they were, is\r\nnot known; but probably the astronomy of those ages consisted in little\r\nmore than remarks on the rising and setting of the fixed stars, as they\r\nwere found to correspond with the seasons of the year;[A4] and, perhaps,\r\nforming them into constellations. That this was done early, appears from\r\nthe book of Job, which has by some been attributed to Moses, who is said\r\nto have been learned in the sciences of Egypt.[A5] “Canst thou bind the\r\nsweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou\r\nbring forth Mazzaroth in his season, or canst thou guide Arcturus with\r\nhis sons?” Perhaps too, some account might be kept of eclipses of the\r\nsun and moon, as they happened, without pretending to predict them for\r\nthe future. These eclipses are thought by some to have been foretold by\r\nthe Jewish prophets in a supernatural way.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A4:\r\n\r\n  See the preceding note.\r\n\r\nFootnote A5:\r\n\r\n  Some of the constellations appear to have been named, even before the\r\n  time of Moses, who was born 1571 years before Christ: but, probably,\r\n  most of them received their names about the time of the Argonautic\r\n  expedition, which took place in the year 1263, B. C\r\n\r\n  Hesiod and Homer who were co-temporaries, or, at least, flourished\r\n  nearly at the same time, that is to say, about nine centuries before\r\n  the Christian era, mention several of the constellations; and, among\r\n  the rest, the Bear and the Hyades: and it is noticed by Mr. Lalande,\r\n  that La Condamine says the Indians on the river Amazons gave to the\r\n  seven stars in the Hyades, the name of the Bull’s-head, as we do; and\r\n  that Father Lasitau tells us, the Iroquois called that assemblage of\r\n  stars to which we give the name of the Bear, by the same name; and\r\n  named the polar star “the star that does not move.”\r\n\r\n  These are interesting facts. There is not the least resemblance,\r\n  whatever, in the two constellations which have been mentioned, to the\r\n  animals whose names they bear. Is it not, then, a matter of great\r\n  curiosity, as well as one which may prove important in its result, to\r\n  enquire, why two great tribes of uncivilized men, (supposed, by some,\r\n  to be aborigines,) in the northern and southern sections of the\r\n  western hemisphere, should apply the same denominations to two\r\n  assemblages of stars, by which those constellations were known to\r\n  Hesiod and Homer, if not earlier, and at least twenty-five hundred\r\n  years before? W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs to the Arabians, though some have supposed them the first inventors\r\nof astronomy, encouraged to contemplate the heavens by the happy\r\ntemperature of their climate, and the serenity of their skies, which\r\ntheir manner of life must likewise have contributed to render more\r\nparticularly the object of their attention; yet it is said, nothing of\r\ncertainty can now be found to induce us to think they had any knowledge\r\nof this science amongst them before they learned it from the writings of\r\nPtolemy, who flourished one hundred and forty years after the birth of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the pretensions of other nations, since it was the\r\nGreeks who improved geometry, probably from its first rudiments, into a\r\nnoble and most useful science; and since we cannot conceive that\r\nastronomy should make any considerable progress without geometry, it is\r\nto them we appear indebted for the foundations of a science, that (to\r\nspeak without a metaphor) has in latter ages reached the astonishingly\r\ndistant heavens.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Greeks, Hipparchus[A6] deserves particular notice; by an\r\nimprovement of whose labours Ptolemy formed that system of astronomy\r\nwhich appears to have been the only one studied for ages after, and\r\nparticularly (as was said before) by the Arabians; who made some\r\nimprovements of their own, and, if not the inventors, were at least the\r\npreservers of astronomy. For with them it took refuge, during those ages\r\nof ignorance which involved Europe, after an inundation of northern\r\npeople had swallowed up the Roman empire; where the universally\r\nprevailing corruption of manners, and false taste, were become as\r\nunfavourable to the cause of science, as the ravages of the Barbarians\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A6:\r\n\r\n  Hipparchus (of Nicæa, in Bithynia,) was a very celebrated\r\n  mathematician and astronomer of antiquity. Mr. Lalande styles him the\r\n  most laborious and most intelligent astronomer of antiquity, of whom\r\n  we have any record; and asserts, that the true astronomy which has\r\n  come down to us, originated with him. He divided the heavens into\r\n  forty-eight (some say forty-nine) constellations, and assigned names\r\n  to the stars. He is also said to have determined latitude and\r\n  longitude and to have computed the latter from the Canaries; and he is\r\n  supposed to be the first who, after Thales, calculated eclipses with\r\n  some degree of accuracy: but he makes no mention of comets. Hipparchus\r\n  died one hundred and twenty five years before the Christian era. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom this time, we meet with little account of astronomical learning in\r\nEurope[A7] until Regiomontanus,[A8] and some others, revived it in the\r\nfifteenth century; and soon afterwards appeared the celebrated\r\nCopernicus,[A9] whose vast genius, assisted by such lights as the\r\nremains of antiquity afforded him, explained the true system of the\r\nuniverse, as at present understood. To the objection of the\r\nAristotelians, that the sun could not be the centre of the world,\r\nbecause all bodies tended to the earth, Copernicus replied, that\r\nprobably there was nothing peculiar to the earth in this respect; that\r\nthe parts of the sun, moon and stars, likewise tended to each other, and\r\nthat their spherical figure was preserved amidst their various motions,\r\nby this power; an answer that will at this day be allowed to contain\r\nsound philosophy. And when it was further objected to him, that,\r\naccording to his system, Venus and Mercury ought to appear horned like\r\nthe moon, in particular situations; he answered as if inspired by the\r\nspirit of prophecy, and long before the invention of telescopes, by\r\nwhich alone his prediction could be verified, “That so they would one\r\nday be found to appear.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A7:\r\n\r\n  Friar Bacon is said to have been almost the only astronomer of his\r\n  age; he informs us that there were then but four persons in Europe who\r\n  had made any considerable proficiency in the mathematics.\r\n\r\nFootnote A8:\r\n\r\n  Regiomontanus was born in the year 1436, at Kœnigsberg, a town of\r\n  Franconia, subject to the house of Saxe-Weimar. His real name was John\r\n  Müller: but he assumed the name of Regiomontanus from that of the\r\n  place of his nativity, which signifies _Regius Mons_.\r\n\r\n  This astronomer, who was greatly celebrated in his time, was the\r\n  first, according to Lalande, who calculated good Almanacks; which he\r\n  had composed for thirty successive years; viz. from 1476 to 1506. In\r\n  these (which were all published at Nuremberg in 1474, two years before\r\n  his death,) he announced the daily longitudes of the planets, their\r\n  latitudes, their aspects, and foretold all the eclipses of the sun and\r\n  moon; and these ephemerides were received with uncommon interest by\r\n  all nations. After noticing these, Lalande mentions the ephemerides\r\n  which are published annually at Bologna, Vienna, Berlin, and Milan;\r\n  but he pronounces the _Nautical Almanack_, of London, to be the most\r\n  perfect ephemeris that was ever published. Regiomontanus compiled\r\n  several other works, which greatly promoted his reputation, He died in\r\n  1476, at the age of forty years. W. B.\r\n\r\nFootnote A9:\r\n\r\n  See some interesting particulars respecting this great man in Lord\r\n  Buchan’s account of the Tomb of Copernicus, and in the note thereto,\r\n  inserted in the Appendix. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNext follows the noble Tycho,[A10] who with great labour and\r\nperseverance, brought the art of observing the heavens to a degree of\r\naccuracy unknown to the ancients; though in theory he mangled the\r\nbeautiful system of Copernicus. The whimsical Kepler, too, (whose\r\nfondness for analogies frequently led him astray, yet sometimes happily\r\nconducted him to important truths) did notable services to astronomy:\r\nand from his time down to the present, so many great men have appeared\r\namongst the several nations of Europe, rivalling each other in the\r\nimprovement of astronomy, that I should trespass on your patience were I\r\nto enumerate them. I shall therefore proceed to what I proposed in the\r\nsecond place, and take notice of some of the most important discoveries\r\nin this science.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A10:\r\n\r\n  Tycho-Brahé, as Lalande remarks, was the first who, by the accuracy\r\n  and the number of his observations, prepared the way for the renewal\r\n  of astronomy. The theories, the tables, and the discoveries of Kepler,\r\n  are founded on his observations; and Lalande thinks, that their names,\r\n  after those of Hipparchus and Copernicus, ought to be transmitted with\r\n  immortal honour to posterity.\r\n\r\n  Tycho was born in the year 1546, at Knudsturp in Scania in Denmark, of\r\n  a noble family, which subsisted also in Sweden under the name of\r\n  Brahé, and to which the marshal count Lœwendahl was allied. He died in\r\n  1601, at the age of fifty-five years.\r\n\r\n  Frederick II, king of Denmark, gave to Tycho the little island of\r\n  Huen, called in Latin _Venusin_, towards the Sound, and about ten\r\n  leagues, northward, from Copenhagen: where that prince erected for him\r\n  a castle, named Uraniberg, and an observatory attached to it,\r\n  completely furnished with the best instruments. Yet only fifty-one\r\n  years after the death of Tycho, Mr. Huet, whose curiosity led him to\r\n  visit a place so celebrated could find no vestige of the observatory.\r\n  One solitary old man, who yet retained some recollection of it, told\r\n  him that the tempestuous winds to which they were subject along the\r\n  Sound, had demolished it. Even the name of Tycho was then unknown in\r\n  that savage island, as Mr. Lalande indignantly styles it: and Mr.\r\n  Picard, who was sent by the French academy, in 1671, to ascertain the\r\n  exact situation of the observatory, was obliged to have the earth dug\r\n  away, in order to discover its foundation. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAstronomy, like the Christian religion, if you will allow me the\r\ncomparison, has a much greater influence on our knowledge in general,\r\nand perhaps on our manners too, than is commonly imagined. Though but\r\nfew men are its particular votaries, yet the light it affords is\r\nuniversally diffused amongst us; and it is difficult for us to divest\r\nourselves of its influence so far, as to frame any competent idea of\r\nwhat would be our situation without it.[A11] Utterly ignorant of the\r\nheavens, our curiosity would be confined solely to the earth, which we\r\nshould naturally suppose a vast extended plain; but whether of infinite\r\nextent or bounded, and if bounded, in what manner, would be questions\r\nadmitting of a thousand conjectures, and none of them at all\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A11:\r\n\r\n  “Certain it is,” says the learned and pious Dr. Samuel Clarke (in his\r\n  Discourse on the _Evidences of Nat. and Rev. Religion_,) “and this is\r\n  a great deal to say, that the generality, even of the meanest and most\r\n  vulgar and ignorant people,” (among Christians,) “have truer and\r\n  worthier notions of God, more just and right apprehensions concerning\r\n  his attributes and perfections, deeper sense of the difference of good\r\n  and evil, a greater regard to moral obligations and to the plain and\r\n  more necessary duties of life, and a more firm and universal\r\n  expectation of a future state of rewards and punishments, than, in any\r\n  heathen country, any considerable number of men were found to have\r\n  had.”\r\n\r\n  In like manner, Archdeacon Paley (in his _View of the Evidences of\r\n  Christianity_) observes:—“Christianity, in every country in which it\r\n  is professed, has obtained a sensible, although not a complete\r\n  influence, upon the public judgment of morals. And this is very\r\n  important. For without the occasional correction which public opinion\r\n  receives, by referring to some fixed standard of morality, no man can\r\n  foretell into what extravagances it might wander.” “From the first\r\n  general notification of Christianity to the present day,” says the\r\n  same ingenious writer, “there have been in every age many millions,\r\n  whose names were never heard of, made better by it, not only in their\r\n  conduct, but in their dispositions; and happier, not so much in their\r\n  external circumstances, as in that which is _inter præcordia_, in that\r\n  which alone deserves the name of happiness, the tranquillity and\r\n  consolation of their thoughts. It has been since its commencement, the\r\n  author of happiness and virtue to millions and millions of the human\r\n  race.” He then asks: “Who is there, that would not wish his son to be\r\n  a Christian?” W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe first discovery then, which paved the way for others more curious,\r\nseems to have been the circular figure of the earth, inferred from\r\nobserving the meridian altitudes of the sun and stars to be different in\r\ndistant places. This conclusion would probably not be immediately drawn,\r\nbut the appearance accounted for, by the rectilinear motion of the\r\ntraveller; and then a change in the apparent situations of the heavenly\r\nbodies would only argue their nearness to the earth: and thus would the\r\nobservation contribute to establish error, instead of promoting truth,\r\nwhich has been the misfortune of many an experiment. It would require\r\nsome skill in geometry, as well as practice in observing angles, to\r\ndemonstrate the spherical figure of the earth from such\r\nobservations.[A12]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A12:\r\n\r\n  Some of the commentators inform us, that Mahomet taught that the earth\r\n  is supported by the tip of the horn of a prodigious ox, who stands on\r\n  a huge white stone; and that it is the little and almost unavoidable\r\n  motions of this ox which produce earthquakes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut this difficulty being surmounted, and the true figure of the earth\r\ndiscovered, a free space would now be granted for the sun, moon, and\r\nstars to perform their diurnal motions on all sides of it; unless\r\nperhaps at its extremities to the north and south; where something would\r\nbe thought necessary to serve as an axis for the heavens to revolve on.\r\nThis Mr. Crantz in his very entertaining history of Greenland informs\r\nus, is agreeable to the philosophy of that country, with this difference\r\nperhaps, that the high latitude of the Greenlander makes him conclude\r\none pole only, necessary: He therefore supposes a vast mountain situate\r\nin the utmost extremity of Greenland, whose pointed apex supports the\r\ncanopy of heaven, and whereon it revolves with but little friction.\r\n\r\nA free space around the earth being granted, our infant astronomer would\r\nbe at liberty to consider the diurnal motions of the stars as performed\r\nin intire circles, having one common axis of rotation. And by\r\nconsidering their daily anticipation in rising and setting, together\r\nwith the sun’s annual rising and falling in its noon day height,\r\nswiftest about the middle space, and stationary for some time when\r\nhighest and lowest, he would be led to explain the whole by attributing\r\na slow motion to the sun, contrary to the diurnal motion, along a great\r\ncircle dividing the heavens into two equal parts, but obliquely situated\r\nwith respect to the diurnal motion. By a like attention to the moon’s\r\nprogress the Zodiac would be formed, and divided into its several\r\nconstellations or other convenient divisions.\r\n\r\nThe next step that astronomy advanced, I conceive, must have been in the\r\ndiscovery attributed to Pythagoras;[A13] who it is said first found out\r\nthat Hesperus and Phosphorus, or the Evening and Morning Star, were the\r\nsame. The superior brightness of this planet, and the swiftness of its\r\nmotion, probably first attracted the notice of the inquisitive: and one\r\nwandering star being discovered, more would naturally be looked for. The\r\nsplendor of Jupiter, the very changeable appearance of Mars, and the\r\nglittering of Mercury by day light, would distinguish them. And lastly,\r\nSaturn would be discovered by a close attention to the heavens. But how\r\noften would the curious eye be directed in vain, to the regions of the\r\nnorth and south, before there was reason to conclude that the orbits of\r\nall the planets lay nearly in the same plane; and that they had but\r\nnarrow limits assigned them in the visible heavens.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A13:\r\n\r\n  Pythagoras, who was one of the most celebrated among the Greek\r\n  philosophers, in the knowledge and study of the heavens, was born\r\n  about 540 years before the Christian era. It is believed that he was\r\n  the first who made mention of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and of\r\n  the angle which this circle makes with the equator; although Pliny\r\n  attributes this discovery to Anaximander, whose birth was seventy\r\n  years earlier. Among the remarkable things which Pythagoras taught his\r\n  disciples, was the doctrine that fire, or heat, occupied the centre of\r\n  the world; it is supposed he meant to say, that the sun is placed in\r\n  the centre of the planetery system, and that the earth revolves around\r\n  him, like the other planets. He also maintained each star to be a\r\n  world; and that these worlds were distributed in an ethereal space of\r\n  infinite extent. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFrom a careful attendance to those newly discovered celestial\r\ntravellers, and their various motions, direct and retrograde, the great\r\ndiscovery arose, that the sun is the centre of their motions; and that\r\nby attributing a similar motion to the earth, and supposing the sun to\r\nbe at rest, all the phænomena will be solved. Hence a hint was taken\r\nthat opened a new and surprizing scene. The earth might be similar to\r\nthem in other respects. The planets too might be habitable worlds. One\r\ncannot help greatly admiring the sagacity of minds, that first formed\r\nconclusions so very far from being obvious; as well as the indefatigable\r\nindustry of astronomers, who originally framed rules for predicting\r\neclipses of sun and moon, which is said to have been done as early as\r\nthe time of Thales;[A14] and must have proved of singular service to\r\nemancipate mankind from a thousand superstitious fears and notions,\r\nwhich juggling impostors (the growth of all ages and countries) would\r\nnot fail to turn to their own advantage.\r\n\r\nFor two or three centuries before and after the beginning of the\r\nChristian era, astronomy appears to have been held in considerable\r\nrepute; yet very few discoveries of any consequence were made, during\r\nthat period and many ages following.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A14:\r\n\r\n  Thales, who died about five centuries and an half before the Christian\r\n  era, in the ninety-sixth year of his age,[A14a] first taught the\r\n  Greeks the cause of eclipses, He knew the spherical form of the earth;\r\n  he distinguished the zones of the earth by the mean of the tropicks\r\n  and the polar circles; and he treated of an oblique circle or zodiac,\r\n  of a meridian which intersects all these circles in extending north\r\n  and south, and of the magnitude of the apparent diameter of the sun.\r\n\r\n  Herodotus, Cicero, and Pliny, assert, as is noticed by Mr. Lalande,\r\n  that Thales had predicted, to the Ionians a total eclipse of the sun,\r\n  which took place during the war between the Lydians and the Medes, But\r\n  the manner in which Herodotus (who lived about one century, only,\r\n  after the time of Thales) speaks of this prediction, is so vague, that\r\n  one finds some difficulty in believing that it was fact, If it were\r\n  true, says Lalande, that Thales had actually foretold an eclipse of\r\n  the sun, it could be no otherwise, than by means of the general period\r\n  of eighteen years, of which he would have acquired a knowledge from\r\n  the Egyptians or the Chaldeans: for the period had not yet arrived,\r\n  when eclipses could be prognosticated by an exact calculation of the\r\n  motion of the moon. W. B.\r\n\r\nFootnote A14a:\r\n\r\n  But, according to Dufresnoy, he was born in the first year of the 35th\r\n  Olympiad, and died the first year of the 52d, those periods\r\n  corresponding, respectively, with the years 640 and 572, B. C.: and if\r\n  so, he lived only sixty-eight years.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe ancients were not wanting in their endeavours to find out the true\r\ndimensions of the planetary system. They invented several very ingenious\r\nmethods for the purpose; but none of them were at all equal, in point of\r\naccuracy, to the difficulty of the problem. They were therefore obliged\r\nto rest satisfied with supposing the heavenly bodies much nearer to the\r\nearth than in fact they are, and consequently much less in proportion to\r\nit. Add to this, that having found the earth honoured with an attendant,\r\nwhile they could discover none belonging to any of the other planets,\r\n_they_ supposed it of far greater importance in the Solar System than it\r\nappears to _us_ to be: And the more praise is due to those few, who\r\nnevertheless conceived rightly of its relation to the whole.\r\n\r\nTycho took incredible pains to discover the parallax of Mars in\r\nopposition; the very best thing he could have attempted in order to\r\ndetermine the distances and magnitudes of the sun and planets. But\r\ntelescopes and micrometers were not yet invented! so that not being able\r\nto conclude any thing satisfactory from his own observations, he left\r\nthe sun’s parallax as he found it settled by Ptolemy, about twenty times\r\ntoo great. And even after he had reduced to rule the refraction of the\r\natmosphere, and applied it to astronomical observations, rather than\r\nshock his imagination by increasing the sun’s distance, already too\r\ngreat for _his_ hypothesis, he chose to attribute a greater refraction\r\nto the sun’s light, than that of the stars, altogether contrary to\r\nreason; that so an excess of parallax might be balanced by an excess of\r\nrefraction. Thus when we willingly give room to one error, we run the\r\nrisk of having a whole troop of its relations quartered upon us. But\r\nKepler afterwards, on looking over Tycho’s observations, found that he\r\nmight safely reduce the sun’s parallax to one minute; which was no\r\ninconsiderable approach to the truth. Alhazen,[A15] an Arabian, had some\r\ntime before, discovered the refraction of light in passing through air;\r\nof which the ancients seem to have been entirely ignorant. They were\r\nindeed very sensible of the errors it occasioned in their celestial\r\nmeasures; but they, with great modesty, attributed them to the\r\nimperfections of their instruments or observations.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A15:\r\n\r\n  Alhazen was one of the greatest of the Arabian astronomers. He went,\r\n  about the year 1100, to Spain, where many of his nation had\r\n  established themselves in the eighth century, and carried thither\r\n  their knowledge of astronomy; yet, from the year 800 down to about\r\n  1300, science remained shrowded with the darkest ignorance, throughout\r\n  Europe.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lalande observes, that the theory of Refractions is an important\r\n  one, in astronomy; although it was considered of little consequence\r\n  until the time of Alhazen. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI must not omit, in honour of Tycho, to observe that he first proved, by\r\naccurate observations, that the comets are not meteors floating in our\r\natmosphere, as Aristotle,[A16] that tyrant in Philosophy, had determined\r\nthem to be, but prodigious bodies at a vast distance from us in the\r\nplanetary regions; a discovery the lateness of which we must regret, for\r\nif it had been made by the ancients, that part of Astronomy (and perhaps\r\nevery other, in consequence of the superior attention paid to it), would\r\nhave been in far greater perfection than it is at this day.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A16:\r\n\r\n  Aristotle, as though he had been of the race of the Ottomans, thought\r\n  he could not reign except he first killed all his brethren. Insomuch\r\n  as he never nameth or mentioneth an ancient author or opinion, but to\r\n  confute or reprove. _Bacon. Advancement._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI had almost forgot to take notice of one important discovery made in\r\nthe early times of Astronomy, the precession of the equinoxes. An\r\nancient astronomer, called Timocharis, observed an appulse of the Moon\r\nto the Virgin’s Spike, about 280 years before the birth of Christ. He\r\nthence took occasion to determine the place of this star, as accurately\r\nas possible; probably with a view of perfecting the lunar theory. About\r\nfour hundred years afterwards, Ptolemy, comparing the place of the same\r\nstar, as he then found it, with its situation determined by\r\nTimocharis,[A17] concluded the precession to be at the rate of one\r\ndegree in an hundred years; but later astronomers have found it swifter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A17:\r\n\r\n  Timocharis of Alexandria endeavoured, with Aristillus, a philosopher\r\n  of the same school, to determine the places of the different stars in\r\n  the heavens, and to trace the course of the planets. Dr. Lempriere\r\n  places him 294 years before Christ; and the Abbé Barthelemy has\r\n  inserted his name in the list of illustrious men, who flourished in\r\n  the fourth century before the Christian era: he probably lived some\r\n  time after the commencement of that century. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhatever other purposes this great law may answer, it will produce an\r\namazing change in the appearance of the heavens; and so contribute to\r\nthat endless variety which obtains throughout the works of Nature. The\r\nseven stars that now adorn our winter skies, will take their turn to\r\nshine in summer. Sirius, that now shines with unrivalled lustre, amongst\r\nthe gems of heaven, will sink below our horizon, and rise no more for\r\nvery many ages! Orion too, will disappear, and no longer afford our\r\nposterity a glimpse of glories beyond the skies! glittering Capella,\r\nthat now passes to the north of our zenith, will nearly describe the\r\nequator:[A18] And Lyra, one of the brightest in the heavens, will become\r\nour Polar Star: Whilst the present Pole Star, on account of its humble\r\nappearance, shall pass unheeded; and all its long continued faithful\r\nservices shall be forgotten! All these changes, and many others, will\r\ncertainly follow from the precession of the equinoxes; the cause of\r\nwhich motion was so happily discovered and demonstrated by the immortal\r\nNewton: A portion of whose honors was nevertheless intercepted by the\r\nprior sagacity of Kepler, to whom I return.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A18:\r\n\r\n  By its peculiar situation it will continue to do so for a long time.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nKepler’s love of harmony encouraged him to continue his pursuits, in\r\nspite of the most mortifying disappointments, until he discovered that\r\nadmirable relation which subsists between the periodic times of the\r\nprimary planets, and their distances from the sun; the squares of the\r\nformer being as the cubes of the latter. This discovery was of great\r\nimportance to the perfection of Astronomy; because the periods of the\r\nplanets are more easily found by observation, and from them their\r\nseveral relative distances may be determined with great accuracy by this\r\nrule. He likewise found from observation, that the planets do not move\r\nin circles; but in elipses, having the sun in one focus. But the causes\r\nlay hid from him, and it was left as the glory of Sir Isaac, to\r\ndemonstrate that both these things must necessarily follow from one\r\nsimple principle, which almost every thing in this science tends to\r\nprove does really obtain in Nature: I mean, that the planets are\r\nretained in their orbits by forces directed to the sun; which forces\r\ndecrease as the squares of their distances encrease.\r\n\r\nKepler also discovered that the planets do not move equally in their\r\norbits, but sometimes swifter, sometimes slower; and that not\r\nirregularly, but according to this certain rule; That in equal times,\r\nthe areas described by lines drawn from the planet to the sun’s centre,\r\nare equal. This, Sir Isaac likewise demonstrated must follow, if the\r\nplanet be retained in its orbit by forces directed to the sun, and\r\nvarying with the distance in any manner whatsoever. These three\r\ndiscoveries of Kepler, afterwards demonstrated by Newton, are the\r\nfoundation of all accuracy in astronomical calculations.[A19]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A19:\r\n\r\n  According to Lalande, Kepler was as celebrated in astronomy by the\r\n  consequences he drew from the observations of Tycho Brahé, as the\r\n  latter was for the immense mass of materials which he had prepared for\r\n  him: and the Abbé Delaporte (in his _Voyageur François_) represents\r\n  him as precursor of Descartes in opticks, of Newton in physicks, and\r\n  as a law-giver (“_legislateur_”) in astronomy.\r\n\r\n  John Kepler, for this was the name of that famous mathematician, was\r\n  born at Wiel, in the duchy of Wirtemberg, in the year 1571; and the\r\n  Abbé Delaporte says, his family was illustrious. He died at Ratisbon,\r\n  in 1630. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe now come to that great discovery, which lay concealed from the most\r\nsubtle and penetrating geniuses amongst mankind, until these latter\r\nages; which so prodigiously enlarged the fields of astronomy, and with\r\nsuch rapidity handed down one curiosity after another, from the heavens\r\nto astonished mortals, that no one capable of raising his eyes and\r\nthoughts from the ground he trod on, could forbear turning his\r\nattention, in some degree, to the subject that engages us this evening.\r\n\r\nGalileo, as he himself acknowledges, was not the first inventor of the\r\ntelescope, but he was the first that knew how to make a proper use of\r\nit.[A20] If we consider that convex and concave lenses had been in use\r\nfor some centuries, we shall think it probable that several persons\r\nmight have chanced to combine them together, so as to magnify _distant_\r\nobjects; but that the small advantage apparently resulting from such a\r\ndiscovery, either on account of the badness of the glasses or the\r\nunskilfulness of the person in whose hands they were, occasioned it to\r\nbe neglected.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A20:\r\n\r\n  The true invention of the telescope cannot be carried back to an\r\n  earlier date than the beginning of the seventeenth century. Johannes\r\n  Baptista Porta, a Neapolitan, in his _Natural Magic_, which was\r\n  published in the year 1589, says, “_Si utramque (lentem concavam et\r\n  convexam) recté componere noveris, et longinqua et proxima majora et\r\n  clara videbis_:” and he is said to have made a telescope, accordingly,\r\n  about the year 1594. But Porta is represented as having made this\r\n  discovery such as it was, by accident; and, as not well understanding\r\n  the proper use of his own invention.\r\n\r\n  According to Baron Bielfeld,[A20a] however, telescopes were first\r\n  constructed a long time after, in Holland; some say, by John\r\n  Lippersheim, a spectacle-maker at Middelbourg in Zealand; others, by\r\n  James Metius, brother to the celebrated professor Adrian Metius, of\r\n  Franeker. Although the invention of this instrument, of indispensable\r\n  use in astronomy, is sometimes attributed to the great Galileo, he has\r\n  himself acknowledged, in his treatise, entitled _Nuncius Siderius_,\r\n  that he took the hint from a report of a German having invented an\r\n  instrument, by means of which, and with the assistance of certain\r\n  glasses, distant objects might be distinguished as clearly as those\r\n  that were near. This is precisely what Porta had mentioned in his\r\n  book, in 1589; and therefore, if Galileo had not referred to a German,\r\n  he might be supposed to have had in his view the Neapolitan’s\r\n  conception of a telescope, announced long before such an instrument\r\n  was properly constructed.\r\n\r\n  Whatever may have been the merit of Porta’s discovery, or the\r\n  pretensions of Lippersheim, the spectacle-maker, and Metius, Peter\r\n  Borel (in his treatise _De vero Telescopii Inventore_) is of the\r\n  opinion that Zachariah Johnson, who, like Lippersheim, was a\r\n  spectacle-maker, and in the same city, made this discovery by chance,\r\n  about the year 1500; that Lippersheim imitated him, after making\r\n  numerous experiments; and that he instructed Metius. There are others,\r\n  who have been considered as having had some sort of claim to this\r\n  important invention; among whom were a Mr. Digges, of England, and a\r\n  M. Hardy, of France, both towards the commencement of the seventeenth\r\n  century.\r\n\r\n  It is certain, however, that Galileo in Italy, (who died in 1642, aged\r\n  seventy-eight years,) and, according to Bielfeld, Simon Marius in\r\n  Germany, were the first that applied the telescope to the\r\n  contemplation of celestial objects. W. B.\r\n\r\nFootnote A20a:\r\n\r\n  _Elem. of Univ. Erud._ b. i. ch. 49.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut Galileo, by great care in perfecting his telescope, and by applying\r\na judicious eye, happily succeeded; and with a telescope magnifying but\r\nthirty times, discovered the moon to be a solid globe, diversified with\r\nprodigious mountains and vallies, like our earth; but without seas or\r\natmosphere. The sun’s bright disk, he found frequently shaded with\r\nspots, and by their apparent motions proved it to be the surface of a\r\nglobe, revolving on its axis in about five and twenty days. This it\r\nseems was a mortifying discovery to the followers of Aristotle; who held\r\nthe sun to be perfect without spot or blemish.[A21] Some of them, it is\r\nsaid, insisted that it was but an illusion of the telescope and\r\nabsolutely refused to look through one, lest the testimony of their\r\nsenses should prove too powerful for their prejudices.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A21:\r\n\r\n  In treating of the astronomy of the Greeks, Lalande contents himself\r\n  with barely introducing the name of Aristotle, among their\r\n  philosophers; seeming to consider him as one who had done very little\r\n  for astronomical science. This philosopher (who died in the\r\n  sixty-third year of his age, and only 322 years B. C.) among his other\r\n  doctrines, not only maintained the eternity of the world; but, that\r\n  Providence did not extend itself to sublunary beings: and as to the\r\n  immortality of the soul, it is uncertain whether he believed it or\r\n  not. Bayle calls his logic and his natural philosophy, “the weakest of\r\n  his works:” and says, further; “It will be an everlasting subject of\r\n  wonder to persons who know what philosophy is, to find that\r\n  Aristotle’s authority was so much respected in the schools, for\r\n  several ages, that, when a disputant quoted a passage from this\r\n  philosopher, he who maintained the thesis durst not say, _Transeat_;\r\n  but must either deny the passage or explain it in his own way.” W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nGalileo likewise discovered the four attendants of Jupiter, commonly\r\ncalled his satellites:[A22] Which at first did not much please that\r\ngreat ornament of his age, the sagacious Kepler. For by this addition to\r\nthe number of the planets, he found their Creator had not paid that\r\nveneration to certain mystical numbers and proportions, which he had\r\nimagined. Let us not blush at this remarkable instance of philosophical\r\nweakness, but admire the candour of the man who confessed it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A22:\r\n\r\n  This discovery was made on the 8th of January, 1610. It was, as Mr.\r\n  Vince observes, a very important one in its consequences; as it\r\n  furnished a ready method of finding the longitude of places, by means\r\n  of their eclipses. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nGalileo not only discovered these moons of Jupiter, but suggested their\r\nuse in determining the longitude of places on the earth; which has since\r\nbeen so happily put in practice, that Fontenelle does not hesitate to\r\naffirm, that they are of more use to Geography and Navigation,[A23] than\r\nour own moon. He discovered the phases of Mars and Venus; that the\r\nformer appears sometimes round and sometimes gibbous, and that the\r\nlatter puts on the shapes of our moon: And from this discovery, he\r\nproved to a demonstration, the truth of the Copernican System.[A24] Nor\r\ndid that wonderful ring, which surrounds Saturn’s body, without touching\r\nit, and which we know nothing in nature similar to, escape his notice;\r\nthough his telescope did not magnify sufficiently to give him a true\r\nidea of its figure.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A23:\r\n\r\n  Although both Geography and Navigation have been wonderfully improved\r\n  by the important discoveries made by the moderns in astronomy, they\r\n  have nevertheless, derived the most essential aid from the application\r\n  of the Compass to their purposes.\r\n\r\n  The invention of this instrument, which is of indispensible utility,\r\n  is almost universally ascribed to Flavio Gioia, a native of Amalfi in\r\n  the kingdom of Naples. He is called, by some writers, Flavio de Melfi,\r\n  (by which is meant, Flavio of Amalfi, this town being the place of his\r\n  nativity;) and his invention of the Compass is placed in the year\r\n  1302. But it is affirmed by others, that Paulus Venetus brought the\r\n  Compass first into Italy from China, in the year 1260. The Chinese\r\n  Compass, however, whatever may be its antiquity, appears to have been\r\n  a very imperfect instrument, compared with the modern Mariner’s\r\n  Compass; and, more especially, with the Azimuth Compass, as improved\r\n  by Dr. Knight and Mr. Smeaton. The Chinese Compass, now used, is\r\n  represented as being nothing more than a magnetic needle kept\r\n  floating, by means of a piece of cork, on the surface of water, in a\r\n  white china ware vessel, divided at bottom into twenty-four points.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of observation, that the French have laid claim to the\r\n  invention of the Compass, upon no better foundation than the\r\n  circumstance of a _fleur de lys_ being always placed at the north\r\n  point of the chard; although it is known, that Gioia decorated the\r\n  north end of the needle with that flower in compliment to his own\r\n  sovereign, who bore it in his arms, as being descended from the royal\r\n  house of France. “It hath been often,” says Dr. Robertson,[A23a] “the\r\n  fate of those illustrious benefactors of mankind, who have enriched\r\n  science and improved the arts by their inventions, to derive more\r\n  reputation than benefit from the happy efforts of their genius. But,”\r\n  continues this eminent historian, “the lot of Gioia has been still\r\n  more cruel; through the inattention or ignorance of contemporary\r\n  historians, he has been defrauded even of the fame to which he had\r\n  such a just title. We receive from them no information with respect to\r\n  his profession, his character, the precise time when he made this\r\n  important discovery, and the accidents and enquiries which led to it:\r\n  the knowledge of this event, though productive of greater effects than\r\n  any recorded in the annals of the human race, is transmitted to us\r\n  without any of those circumstances which can gratify the curiosity\r\n  that it naturally awakens.” W. B.\r\n\r\nFootnote A23a:\r\n\r\n  Hist. of America, vol. i, b. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote A24:\r\n\r\n  Galileo Galilei was a strenuous defender of the system of Copernicus;\r\n  for which he was condemned by the inquisition, in the year 1635, under\r\n  Pope Urban VIII. This extraordinary man was a native of Florence, and\r\n  born in 1564. He died in 1642, aged seventy-eight years.\r\n\r\n                                                                   W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAmongst the fixed stars too, Galileo pursued his enquiries. The\r\nMilky-Way, which had so greatly puzzled the ancient Philosophers, and\r\nwhich Aristotle imagined to be vapours risen to an extraordinary height,\r\nhe found to consist of an innumerable multitude of small stars; whose\r\nlight appears indistinct and confounded together to the naked eye. And\r\nin every part of the heavens, his telescope shewed him abundance of\r\nstars, not visible without it. In short, with such unabated ardour did\r\nthis great man range through the fields of Astronomy, that he seemed to\r\nleave nothing for others to glean after him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, by prodigiously encreasing the magnifying powers of their\r\ntelescopes, his followers made several great discoveries; some of which\r\nI shall briefly mention. Mercury was found to become bisected, and\r\nhorned near its inferior conjunction, as well as Venus. Spots were\r\ndiscovered in Mars, and from their apparent motion, the time of his\r\nrevolution on an axis nearly perpendicular to its orbit, was determined.\r\nA sort of belts or girdles, of a variable or fluctuating nature, were\r\nfound to surround Jupiter, and likewise certain spots on his surface,\r\nwhence he was concluded to make one revolution in about ten hours on his\r\naxis; which is likewise nearly perpendicular to his orbit. Five[A25]\r\nmoons or satellites were found to attend Saturn, which Galileo’s\r\ntelescope; on account of their prodigious distance, could not\r\nreach:[A26] And the form of his ring was found to be a thin circular\r\nplane, so situated as not to be far from parallel to the plane of our\r\nequator; and always remaining parallel to itself. This ring, as well as\r\nSaturn, evidently derives its light from the sun, as appears by the\r\nshadows they mutually cast on each other.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A25:\r\n\r\n  It has been since ascertained that Saturn has seven satellites, as is\r\n  more particularly mentioned in the subsequent note. W. B.\r\n\r\nFootnote A26:\r\n\r\n  It was about six years after the delivery of this oration, (viz. on\r\n  the 13th of March, 1781,) that Herschel discovered the Georgium Sidus.\r\n  And nearly eight years and an half after this first discovery, he made\r\n  two others: on the 28th of August, 1789, he was enabled to ascertain,\r\n  by means of his telescope of forty feet focal length, that Saturn has\r\n  a sixth satellite; and, on the 17th of September following, he found\r\n  that he has a seventh. The same celebrated astronomer has since made\r\n  several important discoveries. Thus, under the liberal patronage of\r\n  his sovereign, has the great Herschel succeeded, by his extraordinary\r\n  skill and industry in the making of very large _specula_, in\r\n  constructing telescopes, which, in the words of the learned Mr. Vince,\r\n  “have opened new views of the heavens, and penetrated into the depths\r\n  of the universe; unfolding scenes which excite no less our wonder than\r\n  our admiration.”\r\n\r\n  Many important discoveries (some of which are noticed in the foregoing\r\n  pages of these memoirs) have been made by other eminent astronomers,\r\n  since the date of Dr. Rittenhouse’s Oration; some of them, indeed,\r\n  since his decease; among which are the discoveries of three new\r\n  planets. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBesides several other remarkable appearances, which Hugenius[A27]\r\ndiscovered amongst the fixed stars, there is one in Orion’s Sword,\r\nwhich, I will venture to say, whoever shall attentively view, with a\r\ngood telescope and experienced eye, will not find his curiosity\r\ndisappointed. “Seven small stars, (says he,) of which three are very\r\nclose together, seemed to shine through a cloud, so that a space round\r\nthem appeared much brighter than any other part of heaven, which being\r\nvery serene and black looked here as if there was an opening, through\r\nwhich one had a prospect into a much brighter region.” Here some have\r\nsupposed old night to be entirely dispossessed, and that perpetual\r\ndaylight shines amongst numberless worlds without interruption.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A27:\r\n\r\n  The celebrated Huygens, who, in his Latin works, is styled _Hugenius_.\r\n  W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis is a short account of the discoveries made with the telescope. Well\r\nmight Hugenius congratulate the age he lived in, on such a great\r\nacquisition of knowledge: And recollecting those great men, Copernicus,\r\nRegiomontanus, and Tycho, so lately excluded from it by death, what an\r\nimmense treasure, says he, would they have given for it. Those ancient\r\nphilosophers too, Pythagoras, Democritus, Anaxagoras, Philolaus, Plato,\r\nHipparchus; would they not have travelled over all the countries of the\r\nworld, for the sake of knowing such secrets of nature, and of enjoying\r\nsuch sights as these?\r\n\r\nThus have we seen the materials collected, which were to compose the\r\nmagnificent edifice of astronomical Philosophy; collected, indeed, with\r\ninfinite labour and industry, by a few volunteers in the service of\r\nhuman knowledge, and with an ardour not to be abated by the weaknesses\r\nof human nature, or the threatened loss of sight, one of the greatest of\r\nbodily misfortunes! It was now time for the great master-builder to\r\nappear, who was to rear up this whole splendid group of materials into\r\ndue order and proportion. And it was, I make no doubt, by a particular\r\nappointment of Providence, that at this time the immortal Newton\r\nappeared. Much had been done preparatory to this great work by others,\r\nwithout which if he had succeeded, we should have been ready to\r\npronounce him something more than human. The doctrine of atoms had been\r\ntaught by some of the ancients. Kepler had suspected that the planets\r\ngravitated towards each other, particularly the earth and moon; and that\r\ntheir motion prevented their falling together: and Galileo first of all\r\napplied geometrical reasoning to the motion of projectiles. But the\r\nsolid spheres of the ancients, or the vortices of Des Cartes,[A28] were\r\nstill found necessary to explain the planetary motions; or if Kepler had\r\ndiscarded them, it was only to substitute something else in their stead,\r\nby no means sufficient to account for those grand movements of nature.\r\nIt was Newton alone that extended the simple principle of gravity, under\r\ncertain just regulations, and the laws of motion, whether rectilinear or\r\ncircular, which constantly take place on the surface of this globe,\r\nthroughout every part of the solar system; and from thence, by the\r\nassistance of a sublime geometry, deduced the planetary motions, with\r\nthe strictest conformity to nature and observation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A28:\r\n\r\n  Among the many eminent astronomers in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\n  centuries, mentioned by Mr. Lalande, in his _Astronomie_, with\r\n  interesting particulars concerning most of them, the only notice he\r\n  there takes of his ingenious countryman, who endeavoured to establish\r\n  the theory of Vortices which he had projected, is in these words:\r\n  “Descartes (René,) né en Touraine en 1596, mort à Stockholm en 1650.\r\n  Sa vie a été écrite fort au long par Baillet, à Paris, 1691, in 4^o.”\r\n  W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nOther systems of Philosophy have been spun out of the fertile brain of\r\nsome great genius or other; and for want of a foundation in nature, have\r\nhad their rise and fall, succeeding each other by turns. But this will\r\nbe durable as science, and can never sink into neglect, until “universal\r\ndarkness buries all.”\r\n\r\nOther systems of Philosophy have ever found it necessary to conceal\r\ntheir weakness, and inconsistency, under the veil of unintelligible\r\nterms[A29] and phrases, to which no two mortals perhaps ever affixed the\r\nsame meaning: But the Philosophy of Newton disdains to make use of such\r\nsubterfuges; it is not reduced to the necessity of using them, because\r\nit pretends not to be of nature’s privy council, or to have free access\r\nto her most inscrutable mysteries; but to attend carefully to her works,\r\nto discover the immediate causes of visible effects, to trace those\r\ncauses to others more general and simple, advancing by slow and sure\r\nsteps towards the great First Cause of all things.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A29:\r\n\r\n  The philosophy of Aristotle retained terms so very obscure, that it\r\n  seems the Devil himself did not understand, or at least could not\r\n  explain them; otherwise we can hardly suppose, that, when the good\r\n  patriarch of Venice had summoned his attendance for this very purpose,\r\n  he would have been so rude as to put him off with an answer not only\r\n  unintelligible but inarticulate. See _Bayle, in Art. Barbaro._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAnd now the Astronomy of our planetary system seemed compleated. The\r\ntelescope had discovered all the globes whereof it is composed, at least\r\nas far as we yet know. Newton with more than mortal sagacity had\r\ndiscovered those laws by which all their various, yet regular, motions\r\nare governed, and reduced them to the most beautiful simplicity: laws to\r\nwhich not only their great and obvious variety of motions are\r\nconformable, but even their minute irregularities; and not only planets\r\nbut comets likewise. The busy mind of man, never satiated with\r\nknowledge, now extended its views further, and made use of every\r\nexpedient that suggested itself, to find the relation that this system\r\nof worlds bears to the whole visible creation. Instruments were made\r\nwith all possible accuracy, and the most skilful observers applied\r\nthemselves with great diligence to discover an annual parallax, from\r\nwhich the distances of the fixed stars would be known. They found\r\nunexpected irregularities, and might have been long perplexed with them\r\nto little purpose, had not Dr. Bradley happily accounted for them, by\r\nshewing that light from the heavenly bodies strikes the eye with a\r\nvelocity and direction, compounded of the proper velocity and direction\r\nof _light_, and of the _eye_, as carried about with the earth in its\r\norbit; compared to which, the diurnal motion and all other accidental\r\nmotions of the eye, are quite inconsiderable. Thus, instead of what he\r\naimed at, he discovered something still more curious, the real velocity\r\nof light, in a way entirely new and unthought of.\r\n\r\nAll Astronomical knowledge being conveyed to us from the remotest\r\ndistances, by that subtle, swift and universal messenger of\r\nintelligence, LIGHT; it was natural for the curious to enquire into its\r\nproperties, and particularly to endeavour to know with what velocity it\r\nproceeds, in its immeasurable journeys. Experimental Philosophy,\r\naccustomed to conquer every difficulty, undertook the arduous problem;\r\nbut confessed herself unequal to the task.[A30] Here, Astronomy itself\r\nrevealed the secret; first in the discovery of Roemer, who found that\r\nthe farther Jupiter is distant from us, the later the light of his\r\nsatellites always reaches us; and afterwards in this of Dr. Bradley,\r\ninformed us, that light proceeds from the sun to us in about eight\r\nminutes of time.[A31]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A30:\r\n\r\n  Alluding to the experiments made in France, for determining the\r\n  velocity of light; which, though unsuccessful, discovered a noble\r\n  philosophical spirit.\r\n\r\nFootnote A31:\r\n\r\n  This prodigious velocity of light can be no argument against its\r\n  materiality, as will appear from the following considerations. The\r\n  greatest velocity which we can communicate to any body, is that of a\r\n  cannon-ball, impelled by gun-powder; this may be at the rate of about\r\n  20 miles in a minute of time. The planet Saturn moves about 360 miles\r\n  in a minute, that is 18 times swifter than a cannon-ball; and the\r\n  comet of 1680, in its perihelion, moved near 56.66 times swifter than\r\n  Saturn, or 990.5 times swifter than a cannon-ball. Now these are\r\n  material bodies, moving with very various, and all of them exceedingly\r\n  great velocities; and no reason appears why the last mentioned\r\n  velocity should be the utmost limit, beyond which nature cannot\r\n  proceed; or that some other body may not move 7 or 8 hundred times\r\n  swifter than a comet, as light is found to do.\r\n\r\n  That the different refrangibility of the rays of light, on which their\r\n  colours depend, arises from their different velocities, seems so\r\n  natural a conjecture, that it has perhaps occurred to every one who\r\n  has thought on this subject. To this there are three principal\r\n  objections. The first is, that, according to this hypothesis, when the\r\n  satellites of Jupiter are eclipsed, their colour ought to change,\r\n  first to a green and then to a blue, before their light becomes\r\n  extinct; which is contrary to experience. But this objection appears\r\n  to me of no weight; for we do not lose sight of the satellite because\r\n  there is no light coming from thence to the eye, but because there is\r\n  not light enough to render it visible. Therefore at the time a\r\n  satellite disappears, there is still light of all colours arriving at\r\n  the eye: and though the blue light should predominate on account of\r\n  its slower progress, yet the red may predominate on another account;\r\n  for along the edge of Jupiter’s shadow, as it passes over the\r\n  satellite, a greater proportion of red light, than of blue, will be\r\n  thrown by the refraction of Jupiter’s atmosphere. The second objection\r\n  is, that since the velocity of the earth in its orbit, causes an\r\n  aberration of about 20 seconds in the place of a star, if the\r\n  different colours of light depended on different velocities, the\r\n  aberration of blue light ought proportionably to exceed that of red\r\n  light, which would give such an oblong form to a fixed star as might\r\n  be discovered with a good telescope. This objection is of no more\r\n  force than the former. The effect ought indeed to follow, but not in a\r\n  sensible quantity; for at the altitude of 70 degrees, the apparent\r\n  place of a fixed star is likewise removed 20 seconds by refraction,\r\n  and the very same separation of the rays must take place; yet this I\r\n  think is not discoverable with the best telescope. Perhaps by uniting\r\n  these two equal causes, which may be readily done, and thereby\r\n  doubling the effect, it may become sensible.\r\n\r\n  The third objection arises from that curious discovery of Dollond, by\r\n  which we are enabled so greatly to improve refracting telescopes. And\r\n  this objection I shall for the present leave in its full force; as\r\n  well against the above hypothesis, as against every other which I have\r\n  seen for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAs the apparent motion of the fixed stars, arising from this cause, was\r\nobserved to complete the intire circle of its changes in the space of a\r\nyear, it was for some time supposed to arise from an annual parallax,\r\nnotwithstanding its inconsistency in other respects with such a\r\nsupposition. But this obstacle being removed, there followed the\r\ndiscovery of another apparent motion in the heavens, arising from the\r\nnutation of the earth’s axis; the period whereof is about nineteen\r\nyears. Had it not been so very different from the period of the former,\r\nthe causes of both must have been almost inexplicable. This latter\r\ndiscovery is an instance of the superior advantages of accurate\r\nobservation: For it was well known that such a nutation must take place\r\nfrom the principles of the Newtonian Philosophy; yet a celebrated\r\nastronomer had concluded from hypothetical reasoning, that its quantity\r\nmust be perfectly insensible.\r\n\r\nThe way being cleared thus far, Dr. Bradley assures us, from his most\r\naccurate observations, that the annual parallax cannot exceed two\r\nseconds, he thinks not one; and we have the best reason to confide in\r\nhis judgment and accuracy. From hence then we draw this amazing\r\nconclusion; that the diameter of the earth’s orb bears no greater\r\nproportion to the distance of the stars which Bradley observed, than one\r\nsecond does to the radius; which is less than as one to 200,000.\r\nProdigiously great as the distance of the fixed stars from our sun\r\nappears to be, and probably their distances from each other are no less,\r\nthe Newtonian Philosophy will furnish us with a reason for it: That the\r\nseveral systems may be sufficiently removed from each other’s\r\nattraction, which we are very certain must require an immense distance;\r\nespecially if we consider that the cometic part, of our system at least,\r\nappears to be the most considerable though so little known to us. The\r\ndimensions of the several parts of the planetary system, had been\r\ndetermined near the truth by the astronomers of the last age, from the\r\nparallax of Mars. But from that rare phenomenon the transit of Venus\r\nover the sun’s disk, which has twice happened within a few years past,\r\nthe sun’s parallax is now known beyond dispute to be 8 seconds and an\r\nhalf, nearly; and consequently, the sun’s distance almost 12,000\r\ndiameters of the earth.\r\n\r\nIf from the distances of the several planets, and their apparent\r\ndiameters taken with that excellent instrument, the micrometer, we\r\ncompare their several magnitudes, we shall find the Moon, Mercury, and\r\nMars, to be much less than our Earth, Venus a little less, but Saturn\r\nmany hundred times greater, and Jupiter above one thousand times. This\r\nprodigious globe, placed at such a vast distance from the other planets,\r\nthat the force of its attraction might the less disturb their motions,\r\nis far more bulky and ponderous than all the other planets taken\r\ntogether. But even Jupiter, with all his fellows of our system, are as\r\nnothing compared to that amazing mass of matter the Sun. How much are we\r\nthen indebted to Astronomy, for correcting our ideas of the visible\r\ncreation! Wanting its instruction, we should infallibly have supposed\r\nthe earth by far the most important body in the universe, both for\r\nmagnitude and use. The sun and moon would have been thought two little\r\nbodies nearly equal in size, though different in lustre, created solely\r\nfor the purpose of enlightening the earth; and the fixed stars, so many\r\nsparks of fire, placed in the concave vault of heaven, to adorn it, and\r\nafford us a glimmering light in the absence of the sun and moon.\r\n\r\nBut how does Astronomy change the scene!—Take the miser from the earth,\r\nif it be possible to disengage him; he whose nightly rest has been long\r\nbroken by the loss of a single foot of it, useless perhaps to him; and\r\nremove him to the planet Mars, one of the least distant from us:\r\nPersuade the ambitious monarch to accompany him, who has sacrificed the\r\nlives of thousands of his subjects to an imaginary property in certain\r\nsmall portions of the earth; and now point it out to them, with all its\r\nkingdoms and wealth, a glittering star “close by the moon,” the latter\r\nscarce visible and the former less bright than our Evening Star:—Would\r\nthey not turn away their disgusted sight from it, as not thinking it\r\nworth their smallest attention, and look for consolation in the gloomy\r\nregions of Mars?[A32]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A32:\r\n\r\n  Mars appears to be surrounded by a very great and dense atmosphere.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut dropping the company of all those, whether kings or misers, whose\r\nminds and bodies are equally affected by gravitation, let us proceed to\r\nthe orb of Jupiter; the Earth and all the inferior planets will vanish,\r\nlost in the sun’s bright rays, and Saturn only remain; He too sometimes\r\nso diminished in lustre, as not to be easily discovered. But a new and\r\nbeautiful system will arise. The four moons of Jupiter will become very\r\nconspicuous; some of them perhaps appearing larger, others smaller than\r\nour moon; and all of them performing their revolutions with incredible\r\nswiftness, and the most beautiful regularity:—varying their phases from\r\nfull to new and from new to full, and frequently eclipsing the sun and\r\neach other, at least to the equatorial parts of Jupiter; and almost in\r\nevery revolution suffering eclipses themselves by falling into Jupiter’s\r\nshadow; excepting that the outermost will seem, like a traveller fond of\r\nthe sun-beams, cautiously to avoid the shadow for whole years together.\r\nSince we are advanced so far, if not tired of the journey, let us\r\nproceed a step further; it is but 400 millions of miles to the globe of\r\nSaturn. Here again all will be lost, but Jupiter itself. The Sun will\r\nput on something of a starlike appearance, but with excessive\r\nbrightness. The five[A33] satellites of Saturn will exhibit appearances\r\nsimilar to those of Jupiter, but they will very rarely eclipse the Sun,\r\nor suffer eclipses themselves. The particular phænomena of Saturn’s\r\nring, we cannot explain, unless we knew the time and plane of Saturn’s\r\nrevolution on his axis. But this we know, that it must sometimes appear,\r\nby night, like a prodigious luminous arch, almost equal to one quarter\r\nof the heavens; and at other times, dark, so as to afford no light\r\nitself, but to intercept the light of every star beyond it, by night,\r\nand of the sun itself by day. And to conclude, if borne on the wings of\r\na comet we should travel with it to the remotest part of its orbit; our\r\nwhole planetary system would disappear, and the sun become a star, only\r\nmore refulgent than Sirius perhaps, because less distant.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A33:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Herschel discovered, in the year 1789, (fourteen years after the\r\n  delivery of this Oration,) two other satellites of Saturn. These are\r\n  the innermost of his (now) seven secondary planets.\r\n\r\n                                                                   W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the earth’s rotation on its axis was once violently\r\nopposed, from a notion of its dangerous tendency with respect to the\r\ninterests of religion:[A34] But, as truth is always consistent with\r\nitself, so many new proofs were furnished from time to time by new\r\ndiscoveries, that a mistaken interpretation of some passages in the\r\nbible was compelled to give way to the force of astronomical evidence.\r\nThe doctrine of a plurality of worlds, is inseparable from the\r\nprinciples of Astronomy; but this doctrine is still thought, by some\r\npious persons, and by many more I fear, who do not deserve that title,\r\nto militate against the truths asserted by the Christian religion. If I\r\nmay be allowed to give my opinion on a matter of such importance, I must\r\nconfess that I think upon a proper examination the apparent\r\ninconsistency will vanish. Our religion teaches us what philosophy could\r\nnot have taught; and we ought to admire with reverence the great things\r\nit has pleased divine Providence to perform, _beyond the ordinary course\r\nof Nature_, for man, who is undoubtedly the most noble inhabitant of\r\nthis globe. But neither religion nor philosophy forbids us to believe\r\nthat infinite wisdom and power, prompted by infinite goodness, may\r\nthroughout the vast extent of creation and duration, have frequently\r\ninterposed in a manner quite incomprehensible to us, when it became\r\nnecessary to the happiness of created beings of some other rank or\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A34:\r\n\r\n  In 745, Virgilus, bishop of Saltzburg, having publicly asserted in\r\n  some of his sermons, that there were antipodes, he was charged with\r\n  heresy, by Boniface, bishop of Mentz, and cited to appear before the\r\n  Pope, who recommended the hearing of the cause to Utilo, King of\r\n  Bohemia, and at the same time wrote to him in favour of Boniface. The\r\n  event was, the bishop of Saltzburg lost his cause, and was condemned\r\n  for heresy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nHow far indeed the inhabitants of the other planets may resemble man, we\r\ncannot pretend to say. If like him they were created liable to fall, yet\r\nsome, if not all of them, may still retain their original rectitude. We\r\nwill hope they do: the thought is comfortable.—Cease, Galileo, to\r\nimprove thy optic tube: and thou, great Newton, forbear thy ardent\r\nsearch into the distant mysteries of nature: lest ye make unwelcome\r\ndiscoveries. Deprive us not of the pleasure of believing that yonder\r\nradiant orbs, traversing in silent majesty the etherial regions, are the\r\npeaceful seats of innocence and bliss: where neither natural nor moral\r\nevil has ever yet intruded; where to enjoy with gratitude and adoration\r\nthe creator’s bounty, is the business of existence. If their inhabitants\r\nresemble man in their faculties and affections, let us suppose that they\r\nare wise enough to govern themselves according to the dictates of that\r\nreason their creator has given them, in such manner as to consult their\r\nown and each other’s true happiness, on all occasions. But if, on the\r\ncontrary, they have found it necessary to erect artificial fabrics of\r\ngovernment, let us not suppose that they have done it with so little\r\nskill, and at such an enormous expence, as must render them a misfortune\r\ninstead of a blessing. We will hope that their statesmen are patriots,\r\nand that their kings, if that order of beings has found admittance\r\nthere, have the feelings of humanity.—Happy people! and perhaps more\r\nhappy still, that all communication with us is denied. We have neither\r\ncorrupted you with our vices, nor injured you by violence. None of your\r\nsons and daughters, degraded from their native dignity, have been doomed\r\nto endless slavery by us in America, merely because _their_ bodies may\r\nbe disposed to reflect or absorb the rays of light, in a way different\r\nfrom _ours_. Even you, inhabitants of the moon, situated in our very\r\nneighbourhood, are effectually secured, alike from the rapacious hand of\r\nthe haughty Spaniard, and of the unfeeling British nabob. Even British\r\nthunder impelled by British thirst of gain, cannot reach you: And the\r\nutmost efforts of the mighty Frederick, that tyrant of the north and\r\nscourge of mankind, if aimed to disturb _your_ peace, becomes\r\ninconceivably ridiculous and impotent.\r\n\r\nPardon these reflections; they rise not from the gloomy spirit of\r\nmisanthropy. That being, before whose piercing eye all the intricate\r\nfoldings and dark recesses of the human heart become expanded and\r\nilluminated, is my witness with what sincerity, with what ardor, I wish\r\nfor the happiness of the whole race of mankind: how much I admire that\r\ndisposition of lands and seas, which affords a communication between\r\ndistant regions, and a mutual exchange of benefits:[A35] how sincerely I\r\napprove of those social refinements which really add to our happiness,\r\nand induce us with gratitude to acknowledge our great Creator’s\r\ngoodness:—how I delight in a participation of the discoveries made from\r\ntime to time in nature’s works, by our Philosophic brethren in Europe.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A35:\r\n\r\n  It has been shewn, in a preceding note, how much the means of\r\n  communicating between distant regions, separated by seas, ware\r\n  facilitated by the discovery and use of the Compass: but those means\r\n  have been still further and very greatly improved, since the\r\n  introduction of the use of the Quadrant at sea, especially that called\r\n  Hadley’s Quadrant.\r\n\r\n  The true inventor of the reflecting Quadrant was Dr. Robert Hook, a\r\n  very ingenious English mathematician and philosopher, who died in the\r\n  year 1702, at the age of sixty-seven years. This instrument, now\r\n  commonly styled Hadley’s, was afterwards rendered much more complete\r\n  than Dr. Hook’s invention had made it, by Sir Isaac Newton: but our\r\n  modern artists, more skilful than those of former times, as Mr.\r\n  Lalande has observed, have profited of the ideas of the great Newton\r\n  himself, on the subject; and among the later improvers of the Sea\r\n  Quadrant, or Octant, is Mr. Hadley, whose name the instrument usually\r\n  bears.\r\n\r\n  It would, however, be doing an act of injustice to the memory of an\r\n  American who possessed an extraordinary genius, to omit, in the course\r\n  of these memoirs, some notice of his merits in relation to this\r\n  matter. Mr. Thomas Godfrey, a native of Pennsylvania, is said to have\r\n  turned his attention to this subject, so early as the year 1730; and\r\n  in the Transactions of the Royal Society of London, No. 435, will be\r\n  found, an “_Account of Mr. Thomas Godfrey’s Improvement of Davis’s\r\n  Quadrant transferred to the Mariner’s Bow_,” drawn up by James Logan,\r\n  Esq. formerly of Philadelphia, a gentleman of extensive learning, and\r\n  a very eminent mathematician, Mr. Godfrey is stated to have “sent the\r\n  instrument (which he had constructed) to be tried at sea by an\r\n  acquaintance of his, an ingenious navigator, in a voyage to Jamaica,\r\n  who shewed it to a captain of a ship there, just going for England; by\r\n  which means, it came to the knowledge of Mr. Hadley, though perhaps\r\n  without his being told the name of the real inventor.” [See _The\r\n  American Magazine_, for July 1758.] In a letter, dated at Philadelphia\r\n  the 25th of May, 1732, Mr. Logan, who very ably as well as\r\n  meritoriously patronized Godfrey, communicated to the celebrated Dr.\r\n  Edmund Halley a detailed account and description of the _improved_\r\n  Sea-Quadrant constructed by that ingenious citizen of America, of\r\n  which his patron confidently believed him to be the original inventor.\r\n  On the 28th of June, 1734, a further account of Godfrey’s invention\r\n  was drawn up by Mr. Logan, and subscribed with his name; which, it is\r\n  presumed, was also communicated to the Royal Society: and on the 9th\r\n  of November, in the same year, Mr. Godfrey transmitted an account of\r\n  it, draughted and signed by himself, to the same learned body. The\r\n  whole of these interesting letters, with some accompanying\r\n  observations on the subject, are published in the valuable _Magazine_\r\n  just referred to, and in the one for the succeeding month.\r\n\r\n  In the Transactions of the Royal Society, for the months of October,\r\n  November and December, 1731, No. 421, is contained a Proposal, by Dr.\r\n  Edmund Halley, for finding the longitude at sea, within a degree or\r\n  twenty leagues, &c. In the conclusion of this paper, Dr, Halley, in\r\n  speaking of John Hadley, Esq. VP.R.S, (“to whom,” as he observes, “we\r\n  are highly obliged for his having perfected and brought into common\r\n  use the reflecting telescope,”) says—He “has been pleased to\r\n  communicate _his_ most ingenious instrument for taking the angles _by\r\n  reflection_,” (referring, here, to the Philos. Trans. No. 420;) “it is\r\n  more than probable that the same may be applied to taking angles _at\r\n  sea_, with the desired accuracy.”\r\n\r\n  In Mr. Logan’s account of Mr. Godfrey’s invention, dated June 28,\r\n  1734, he says: “Tis now four years since Thomas Godfrey hit on this\r\n  improvement; for, his account of it, laid before the (Royal) Society\r\n  last winter, in which he mentioned two years, was wrote in 1732; and\r\n  in the same year, 1730, after he was satisfied in this, he applied\r\n  himself to think of the other, viz. _the reflecting instrument, by\r\n  speculums for a help in the case of longitude_, though ’tis also\r\n  useful in taking altitudes: and one of these, as has been abundantly\r\n  proved by the maker, and those who had it with them, was taken to sea\r\n  and there used in observing the latitudes the winter of that year, and\r\n  brought back again to Philadelphia before the end of February 1730–1,\r\n  and was in my keeping some months immediately after.”\r\n\r\n  In Mr, Logan’s prior letter to Dr. Halley (dated May 25, 1732,) he\r\n  says, that about eighteen months before, Godfrey told him, “he had for\r\n  some time before been thinking of an instrument for taking the\r\n  distances of stars by reflecting speculums, which he believed might be\r\n  of service “at sea;” and that, soon after, Godfrey shewed him an\r\n  instrument, which he had procured to be made, for the purpose. Thus,\r\n  the time to which Mr. Logan refers Godfrey’s communication of his\r\n  improvement to him, would make its date to be about the month of\r\n  November, 1730.\r\n\r\n  In the Rev. Mr. Vince’s great work, entitled, _A Complete System of\r\n  Astronomy_, (and contained in “A Treatise on Practical Astronomy,” at\r\n  the end of the second volume of that work,) is an entire chapter on\r\n  “_Hadley’s Quadrant_;” giving a particular description of the\r\n  instrument, with rules for the computations from the observations and\r\n  illustrations of them by examples. In this Treatise, the author says,\r\n  that the instrument took its name from the “inventor,” John Hadley,\r\n  Esq. and observes, that not only the science of navigation is greatly\r\n  indebted, to this “incomparable instrument,” but such are its various\r\n  uses in astronomy, that it may not improperly be called “a portable\r\n  observatory.” Mr. Vince further observes, that in the year 1742, about\r\n  ten years after Mr. Hadley’s invention (for so he styles it) was\r\n  published, a paper in Sir Issac Newton’s own hand-writing was found\r\n  among Dr. Halley’s papers, after the Doctor’s death, containing a\r\n  figure and description of an instrument (referring to _Philos.\r\n  Transactions_, No. 465,) not much different in its principle from this\r\n  of Hadley. He adds, that as Dr. Halley was alive when Mr. Hadley’s\r\n  instrument was shewn to the Royal Society, and he took no notice of\r\n  this paper of Sir Isaac Newton, it is probable he did not know there\r\n  was such an one. In another part of his work (under the head of _The\r\n  History of Astronomy_, vol. ii. p. 280.) Mr. Vince asserts, that the\r\n  first person who formed the idea of making a Quadrant to take angles\r\n  by reflection, was Robert Hook; and he was born in 1635. On the whole,\r\n  however, the learned author draws this conclusion:—“Both Sir Isaac\r\n  Newton and Mr. Hadley therefore seem entitled to this invention.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lalande, speaking of this instrument, says: “Le Quartier de\r\n  Reflexion, exécuté en 1731 par Hadley, a donné un moyen facile de\r\n  mesurer les distances sur mer, à une minute pris, aussi bien\r\n  determiner le lieu de la Lune en mer.” See his _Astronomie_, vol. iii.\r\n  p. 654.\r\n\r\n  From these facts, and a careful examination of the papers themselves,\r\n  here quoted and referred to, the scientific reader will be enabled to\r\n  decide upon the true merits of the controversy that has so long\r\n  subsisted, concerning the respective claims of Godfrey and of Hadley,\r\n  to the invention of the instrument that bears the name of the latter.\r\n\r\n  Before this subject is dismissed, however, it will not be deemed\r\n  improper to add, that the late Dr. John Ewing communicated to the Am.\r\n  Philosophical Society an account of an Improvement in the construction\r\n  of (what he terms) “Godfrey’s double reflecting Quadrant,” which he\r\n  had discovered in the spring or summer of the year 1767: this will be\r\n  found in the first volume of the Society’s Transactions. In the\r\n  conclusion of this communication, Dr. Ewing says:—“This improvement of\r\n  an instrument, which was first invented and constructed by Mr. Godfrey\r\n  of this city, and which I do not hesitate to call the most useful of\r\n  all astronomical instruments that the world ever knew, I hope will\r\n  make it still more serviceable to mankind.”\r\n\r\n  This communication to the Society by Dr. Ewing, was made in the year\r\n  1770. In one concerning the comet of that year, and made by Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse about the same time, the instrument to which Dr. Ewing’s\r\n  improvement applies, is called Hadley’s Quadrant: but perhaps Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse so named it, in conformity to common usage.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut when I consider, that _luxury_ and her constant follower _tyranny_,\r\nwho have long since laid in the dust, never to rise again, the glories\r\nof Asia, are now advancing like a torrent irresistible, whose weight no\r\nhuman force can stem, and have nearly completed their conquest of\r\nEurope; luxury and tyranny, who by a vile affectation of virtues they\r\nknow not, pretend at first to be the patrons of science and philosophy,\r\nbut at length fail not effectually to destroy them; agitated I say by\r\nthese reflections, I am ready to wish—vain wish! that nature would raise\r\nher everlasting bars between the new and old world; and make a voyage to\r\nEurope as impracticable as one to the moon. I confess indeed, that by\r\nour connections with Europe we have made most surprising, I had almost\r\nsaid unnatural, advances towards the meridian of glory; but by those\r\nconnections too, in all probability, our fall will be premature. May the\r\nGod of knowledge inspire us with wisdom to prevent it: let our harbours,\r\nour doors, our hearts, be shut against luxury. But I return to my\r\nsubject, and will no longer indulge these melancholy thoughts.\r\n\r\nSome have observed, that the wonderful discoveries of the microscope\r\nought to go hand in hand with those of the telescope; lest whilst we\r\ncontemplate the many instances of the wisdom and power of divine\r\nProvidence, displayed in the great works of creation, we should be\r\ntempted to conclude that man, and other less important beings of this\r\nlower world, did not claim its attention. But I will venture to affirm,\r\nwithout at all derogating from the merits of those who have so greatly\r\nobliged the world with the success of their microscopical enquiries,\r\nthat no such danger is to be apprehended. Nothing can better demonstrate\r\nthe immediate presence of the Deity in every part of space, whether\r\nvacant or occupied by matter, than astronomy does. It was from an\r\nastronomer St. Paul quoted that exalted expression, so often since\r\nrepeated; “_In God we live, and move, and have our being_.” His divine\r\nenergy supports that universal _substratum_ on which all corporal\r\nsubstances subsist, that the laws of motion are derived from, and that\r\nwings _light_ with angelic swiftness.\r\n\r\nIf the time would permit, how agreeable the task to dwell on the praises\r\nof Astronomy: to consider its happy effects as a science, on the human\r\nmind. Let the sceptical writers forbear to lavish encomiums on their\r\ncobweb Philosophy, liable to be broken by the smallest incident in\r\nnature. They tell us it is of great service to mankind, in banishing\r\nbigotry and superstition from amongst us. Is not this effectually done\r\nby Astronomy? The direct tendency of this science is to dilate the heart\r\nwith universal benevolence, and to enlarge its views. But then it does\r\nthis without propagating a single point of doctrine contrary to common\r\nsense, or the most cultivated reason. It flatters no fashionable\r\nprincely vice, or national depravity. It encourages not the libertine by\r\nrelaxing any of the precepts of morality; nor does it attempt to\r\nundermine the foundations of religion. It denies none of those\r\nattributes, which the wisest and best of mankind, have in all ages\r\nascribed to the Deity: Nor does it degrade the human mind from that\r\ndignity, which is ever necessary to make it contemplate itself with\r\ncomplacency. None of these things does Astronomy pretend to; and if\r\nthese things merit the aim of Philosophy, and the encouragement of a\r\npeople, then let scepticism flourish, and Astronomy lie neglected; then\r\nlet the names of Berkeley, and Hume, become immortal, and that of Newton\r\nbe lost in oblivion.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this part of my discourse with the words of Dr.\r\nBarrow—It is to Astronomy we owe “that we comprehend the huge fabric of\r\nthe universe, admire and contemplate the wonderful beauty of the divine\r\nworkmanship, and so learn the invincible force and sagacity of our own\r\nminds, as to acknowledge the blessings of heaven with a pious\r\naffection.”\r\n\r\nI now come, in the last place, to point out some of the defects of\r\nAstronomy at this day. Which I am induced to undertake by the hopes I\r\nentertain that some of those defects may be removed under the auspices\r\nof this society, and of you my fellow citizens, who have so zealously\r\npromoted its institution. “The advantages arising from Astronomy, the\r\npleasure attending the study of it, the care with which it was\r\ncultivated by many great men among the ancients, and the extraordinary\r\nattention paid to it in Europe by the present age,” all contribute to\r\nrecommend it to your protection, under which we have the best reason to\r\nexpect that it will flourish.\r\n\r\nThe mildness of our climate and the serenity of our atmosphere, perhaps\r\nnot inferior to that of Italy, and likewise our distant situation from\r\nthe principal observatories in the world (whence many curious phænomena\r\nmust be visible here that are not likely to be observed any where else)\r\nare so many circumstances greatly in our favour.\r\n\r\nAnd I trust there will not be wanting men of genius, to arise in this\r\nnew world, whose talents may be particularly adapted to astronomical\r\nenquiries. Indeed I am persuaded that nature is by no means so nigardly\r\nin producing them, as we are apt to imagine. Some are never tempted\r\nforth from obscurity, some are untimely snatched away by death, a\r\nstriking instance whereof we have in Horrox; and many are accidentally\r\nled to other pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe Astronomy of comets is still in its infancy; not that the attention\r\nof the learned and ingenious has at all been wanting for more than a\r\ncentury past; but because it will necessarily require many ages to bring\r\nit to perfection. I wish we were in a condition to promote it in some\r\ndegree, by carefully observing such comets as may appear. As yet we\r\nscarce dare affirm that any one has or will return a second time. It has\r\nnever, that I know of, been certainly proved by observation, that a\r\ncomet has descended within a parabolic orbit, and until that is done we\r\nhave only a coincidence of periods and orbits (none of which have been\r\nvery precise) to depend on for their return. Far less are astronomers\r\nable to determine the changes that may, and probably do, happen in their\r\norbits[A36] and velocities in every period, so as to predict their\r\nnearer or more remote approach to the earth or any planet. Whether their\r\nbusiness be to repair or destroy, whether they are worlds yet in\r\nformation or once habitable worlds in ruins; whether they are at present\r\nhabitable and regular attendants of our Sun only, or whether they are\r\nthe vast links that connect the distant parts of creation by surrounding\r\nmore suns than one, we know not.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A36:\r\n\r\n  This I know has been pretended to. But it is easy to make geometrical\r\n  conclusions come out as we would have them, when the data they are\r\n  founded on, are so uncertain that we may chuse them as suits our\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf we descend to the Planetary System, there are still many things\r\nwanting to compleat Astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of the primary planets have at one time been supposed\r\nmoveable with various irregularities, at other times fixed and\r\npermanent. It seems now generally granted, that according to the theory\r\nof gravity they must change their situations; yet not long since, some\r\ngreat astronomers warmly contended that this change was altogether\r\ninsensible.\r\n\r\nAccording to the best tables we now have, the planes of the orbits of\r\nJupiter, the Earth and Mercury are immoveable, though the orbits\r\nthemselves have a progressive motion in their planes. On the contrary,\r\nthe poles of the orbits of Saturn, Mars and Venus are supposed to\r\nrevolve about the poles of the earth’s orbit, with such velocities as at\r\npresent nearly reconcile calculation to appearances. But there is good\r\nreason to apprehend that such a supposition is not true in fact, and a\r\nmistake in this matter will have some important consequences. More\r\nprobable is it, that the poles of the orbits of all the planets, the\r\nearth not excepted, revolve about some common centre. The several\r\nquantities of these motions, I am confident, are to be had from\r\nobservation, and not from theory alone. If such a motion of the earth’s\r\norbit be admitted, it will account for the diminution[A37] of the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic; which seems now incontestible; and that in\r\nwhatever manner we divide the forces producing such motion, amongst the\r\ntwo superior planets and Venus, or even amongst all of them. And I\r\nshould suspect the further diminution of obliquity, from this cause,\r\nwill amount to about one degree and an half.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A37:\r\n\r\n  This circumstance tends gradually to lessen the variety of the\r\n  seasons.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut as Astronomy now stands, it seems doubtful whether this change is\r\nowing to a deviation in the diurnal or annual motion of the earth; which\r\nintroduces a very disagreeable uncertainty in conclusions drawn from\r\nsome nice and useful observations.\r\n\r\nThe Lunar Astronomy has been brought so much nearer to perfection, by\r\nthe celebrated MAYER,[A38] than could have been expected, that I shall\r\nmention no deficiency in it, but this. We do not certainly know whether\r\nthat apparent acceleration of the moon’s motion, which Mayer with other\r\ngreat astronomers has admitted, ought to be attributed to a real\r\nincrease of velocity in the moon, or to a diminution of the earth’s\r\ndiurnal motion. If to the former, the destruction of this beautiful and\r\nstupendous fabric, may from thence be predicted with more certainty than\r\nfrom any other appearance in Nature: But if to the latter, it may be\r\nprettily accounted for, by Dr. Halley’s ingenious hypotheses concerning\r\nthe change of variation in the magnetical needle. The Doctor supposes\r\nthe external crust or shell of the earth to contain a nucleus detatched\r\nfrom it, and that the impulse which first caused the diurnal motion, was\r\ngiven to the external parts, and from thence in time communicated to the\r\ninternal nucleus, by means of an intervening fluid; but not so as\r\nperfectly to equal the velocity of the superficial parts of the globe.\r\nWhence it will follow, that the external shell of the earth is still\r\ncommunicating motion to the internal parts, and losing motion itself\r\nproportionably. The diurnal motion must therefore become slower and\r\nslower, yet can never be retarded, by this cause, beyond certain limits;\r\nnor can we conceive that any inconvenience will follow.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A38:\r\n\r\n  This was Tobias Mayer, who was born at Marbach in the principality of\r\n  Wurtemberg, in the year 1723: he rendered himself celebrated in\r\n  astronomy, by having calculated the best tables of the moon, and by an\r\n  excellent catalogue of stars. He died at Gottingen in 1762, at the age\r\n  of thirty-nine years. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThere is another physical question relating to the moon, which to me\r\nappears extremely curious; it is this—Whence is it that the moon always\r\nturns the same side to us? or, which is the same thing, How comes the\r\nmoon’s rotation on her axis, and her monthly revolution about the earth,\r\nto be performed in the same time? None I believe will suppose it to be\r\naccidental, nor will the astronomer be easily satisfied with a final\r\ncause. Was it not originally brought about by a natural cause which\r\nstill subsists? Can the attraction of any foreign body change a rotatory\r\nmotion into a libratory one, and a libratory motion into rest, in spaces\r\nso very free from all resistance as those wherein the planets move?\r\nThere are other defects in Astronomy that are purely optical. Removing\r\nof those, depends on the further improvement of telescopes, or rather on\r\nthe more judicious use of them, at times and places the most favourable.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of telescopic discoveries I purposely reserved those made on\r\nVenus for this place, because they are still uncertain. Burratini in\r\nPoland first discovered spots in Venus, then Cassini in Italy; and\r\nafterwards Bianchini got a sight of them. But from all their\r\nobservations it is uncertain, whether Venus revolves on its axis once in\r\n23 hours, or once in 24 days. Perhaps it does neither. Nor is their\r\ndetermination of the axis’ situation much more satisfactory. These spots\r\non Venus are not to be seen but through an excellent telescope and a\r\npure atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1672 and 1676 Cassini saw a small star near Venus, which he\r\nthought might be a satellite attending on her. It appeared to have the\r\nsame phase with Venus. In 1740 Mr. Short with a telescope of 16 inches\r\nsaw a small star at the distance of ten minutes from Venus, which from\r\nits apparent shape he likewise thought might be a satellite. And in 1761\r\nMr. Montaigne, in France, saw what he took to be the satellite of Venus,\r\non the 3d, 4th, 7th and 11th of May.[A39] But whether Venus has a\r\nsatellite or not, must still be left amongst the doubtful things of\r\nAstronomy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A39:\r\n\r\n  It may happen that any of the planets, about the time they become\r\n  stationary, shall describe a loop about some small fixed star, in such\r\n  manner as might be easily mistaken for the star making part of a\r\n  revolution about the planet. This I suspected to have been the case\r\n  with the above observation of Montaigne. But the times set down do not\r\n  confirm the suspicion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe spots on the sun, and those on the surfaces of several planets, have\r\nbeen many years observed without our approaching any nearer towards\r\ndiscovering their nature and cause. Dr. Wilson of Glasgow, has lately\r\nsucceeded in advancing one step at least, with respect to those of the\r\nsun. He has proved from observation that those spots are vast cavities,\r\nwhose bottoms lie far below the general surface of the sun, and whose\r\nsloping sides form the border which we generally see surrounding them.\r\nIf I should venture to add one conjecture of my own, to those of this\r\ningenious gentleman, I would suppose that those prodigious cavities in\r\nthe surface of the sun, some of them capable of containing half our\r\nearth, are not repeatedly formed by unaccountable explosions of a\r\nsemifluid substance, but permanent and solid, like the cavities within\r\nthe moon. And that it is the dark matter sometimes lodging in them, that\r\ndistinguishes them, and is only accidental.\r\n\r\nThe diurnal rotations of Saturn and Mercury are yet unknown; but when\r\nfurther improvements shall be made in the art of using telescopes, this\r\ncircumstance will hardly escape the vigilance of astronomers.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the many things that are still left to the industry\r\nof the ingenious in this science.\r\n\r\nBut if all higher and more sublime discoveries are not reserved for us\r\nin a future and more perfect state; if Astronomy shall again break those\r\nlimits that now seem to confine it, and expatiate freely in the superior\r\ncelestial fields; what amazing discoveries may yet be made amongst the\r\nfixed stars! That grand phænomenon the Milky-Way seems to be the clue\r\nthat will one day guide us. Millions of small stars compose it, and many\r\nmore bright ones lie in and near it, than in other parts of heaven. Is\r\nnot this a strong indication that this astonishing system of worlds\r\nbeyond worlds innumerable, is not alike extended every way, but confined\r\nbetween two parallel planes, of _immeasureable_, though not _infinite_\r\nextent? Or rather, is not the Milky-Way a vein of a closer texture,\r\nrunning through this part of the material creation? Great things are\r\nsometimes best explained by small and small by great. Material\r\nsubstances, such as we daily handle, have been thought composed of\r\nimpenetrable particles in actual contact: then again it has seemed\r\nnecessary to suppose them at a distance from each other, and kept in\r\ntheir relative situations by _attraction_ and _repulsion_. Many\r\nappearances require that those distances should be very great in\r\nproportion to the size of the particles. Hence some, with no small\r\nreason, have concluded that matter consists of indivisible points endued\r\nwith certain powers. Let us compare these smaller portions of it with\r\nthat great aggregate of matter which is the object of Astronomy; _Light_\r\nwill then appear to have as free passage through a piece of glass, as\r\nthe comets have in the planetary regions; and several other new\r\nconsiderations will arise.\r\n\r\nIf instead of _descending_ we _ascend_ the scale. If we consider that\r\ninfinite variety which obtains in those parts of nature with which we\r\nare most intimate: how one order of most curiously organized bodies,\r\ninfinitely diversified in other respects, all agree in being fixed to\r\nthe earth, and receiving nourishment from thence: how another order have\r\nspontaneous motion, and seek their food on different parts of the earth,\r\nwhilst by gravity they are confined to its surface, but in other\r\nrespects diversified like the former. How a _third_ float in, and below\r\nthe surface of, a dense fluid, of equal weight with their bodies, which\r\nwould soon prove fatal to both the others: And a _fourth_ consisting of\r\na vast variety too, have this property in common, that by a peculiar\r\nmechanism of their bodies, they can soar to great heights above the\r\nearth, and quickly transport themselves to distant regions in a fluid so\r\nrare as to be scarcely sensible to us. But not to pursue this boundless\r\nsubject any further, I say, when we consider this great variety so\r\nobvious on _our_ globe, and ever connected by some degree of uniformity,\r\nwe shall find sufficient reason to conclude, that the visible creation,\r\nconsisting of revolving worlds and central suns, even including all\r\nthose that are beyond the reach of human eye and telescope, is but an\r\ninconsiderable part of the whole. Many other and very various orders of\r\nthings unknown to, and inconceivable by us, may, and probably do exist,\r\nin the unlimited regions of space. And all yonder stars innumerable,\r\nwith their dependencies, may perhaps compose but the leaf of a flower in\r\nthe Creator’s garden, or a single pillar in the immense building of the\r\nDivine Architect.\r\n\r\nHere is ample provision made for the all-grasping mind of man!\r\n\r\nIf it shall please that Almighty Power who hath placed us in a world,\r\nwherein we are only permitted “_to look about us and to die_;” should it\r\nplease him to indulge us with existence throughout that half of eternity\r\nwhich still remains unspent; and to conduct us through the several\r\nstages of his works; here is ample provision made for employing every\r\nfaculty of the human mind, even allowing its powers to be constantly\r\nenlarged through an endless repetition of ages. Let us not complain of\r\nthe vanity of this world, that there is nothing in it capable of\r\nsatisfying us: happy in those wants, happy in those restless desires,\r\nforever in succession to be gratified; happy in a continual approach to\r\nthe Deity.\r\n\r\nI must confess that I am not one of those sanguine spirits who seem to\r\nthink, that when the withered hand of death hath drawn up the curtain of\r\neternity, almost all distance between the creature and creator, between\r\nfinite and infinite, will be annihilated. Every enlargement of our\r\nfaculties, every new happiness conferred upon us, every step we advance\r\ntowards the perfection of the divinity, will very probably render us\r\nmore and more sensible of his inexhaustible stores of communicable\r\nbliss, and of his inaccessible perfections.\r\n\r\nWere we even assured that we shall perish like the flowers of the\r\ngarden, how careful would a wise man be to preserve a good conscience,\r\nduring the short period of his existence; because by his very\r\nconstitution, which he cannot alter, this is his pride and glory, and\r\nabsolutely necessary to his present happiness; because this would insure\r\nto him at the approach of death, the soothing reflection, that he was\r\ngoing to restore, pure and uncorrupted, that drop of divinity within\r\nhim, to the original ocean from whence it was separated. How much more\r\nanxiously careful ought we to be, if we believe, as powerful arguments\r\ncompel us to believe, that a conduct in this life depending on our own\r\nchoice, will stamp our characters for ages yet to come. Who can endure\r\nthe thought of darkening his faculties by an unworthy application of\r\nthem here on earth, and degrading himself to some inferior rank of\r\nbeing, wherein he may find both his power and inclination to obtain\r\nwisdom and exercise virtue, exceedingly diminished? On the other hand,\r\nif that humble admiration and gratitude, which sometimes rises in our\r\nminds when we contemplate the power, wisdom and goodness of the Deity,\r\nconstitutes by far the most sublimely happy moments of our lives, and\r\nprobably will forever continue to do so, there cannot be a stronger\r\nincitement to the exercise of virtue and a rational employment of those\r\ntalents we are entrusted with, than to consider that by these means we\r\nshall in a few years be promoted to a more exalted rank amongst the\r\ncreatures of God, have our understandings greatly enlarged, be enabled\r\nto follow truth in all her labyrinths with a higher relish and more\r\nfacility, and thus lay the foundation of an eternal improvement in\r\nknowledge and happiness.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n                 [TRANSLATED FROM THE LATIN ORIGINAL.]\r\n\r\n       _To the illustrious and celebrated Society of Sciences, at\r\n                             Philadelphia_,\r\n\r\n  CHRISTIAN MAYER, Astronomer to the most serene Prince, the Elector\r\n  Palatine, wisheth prosperity.\r\n\r\n  I have concluded on due reflection, that the opportunity of writing,\r\n  afforded me by the eminent Mr. Ferdinando Farmer, ought the less to be\r\n  neglected, as by this means I might make some small return for the\r\n  honour which the illustrious Society conferred on me, when they\r\n  enrolled me in the list of their members.\r\n\r\n  I learnt with great pleasure, by a work printed in Philadelphia, and\r\n  transmitted to me about three years since, that even there Astronomy\r\n  is cultivated. That book, together with my own astronomical papers,\r\n  having been destroyed by an unfortunate fire about two years ago, I\r\n  have been induced to address something to your illustrious Society,\r\n  concerning some of my new discoveries in the heavens.\r\n\r\n  I occupy a new Observatory at Manheim, accommodated to all\r\n  astronomical purposes: nor is it deficient in any of the most valuable\r\n  London-made instruments. Among these, the one which principally\r\n  excels, is a mural quadrant of brass, of eight feet radius, made by\r\n  that celebrated artist Bird, in the year 1776; fitted with an\r\n  achromatic telescope, and firmly affixed to a wall, in the meridian;\r\n  which I use daily, when the weather permits. I observed, nearly two\r\n  years since, that, among the fixed stars, many of them from the first\r\n  to the sixth degree of magnitude, other small attendant stars (or\r\n  satellites) were distinguishable: some of which, by reason of their\r\n  steady and dim light, resemble an order of planets, while others do\r\n  not exceed the smallness of the telescopic size. The circumstance\r\n  which principally excited my surprize, is, that I found none of those\r\n  little attendant stars, a very few only excepted, contained in any\r\n  known catalogue; although I could clearly discover that their use, for\r\n  the purpose of determining the proper motion of the fixed stars, is\r\n  very obvious. For where the difference of right ascension and\r\n  declination, of a few seconds at most, is found between the brighter\r\n  fixed star and its attendant, the lapse of time could scarcely give\r\n  any other variation to the fixed star, than to its satellite: from\r\n  what cause soever that variation may arise, whether from the\r\n  precession of the equinoxes, the variation in the obliquity of the\r\n  ecliptic, the deviation of the instrument, or from the aberration of\r\n  light or the nutation, or from any other cause whatever, which may\r\n  depend on the mutable state of the atmosphere or the latitude of\r\n  places, the fact is evident, that every change of situation, observed,\r\n  between the fixed star and its satellite, affords the most certain\r\n  proof of its actual motion; whether this be referred to the fixed star\r\n  or its satellite.\r\n\r\n  I knew that Halley, the celebrated English astronomer, was the first,\r\n  who, in the year 1719, from an actual comparison of Flamstead’s\r\n  observations with those of Ptolemy, respecting some few fixed stars,\r\n  Syrius, Arcturus, and Aldebaran, discovered that these stars moved,\r\n  with a motion peculiar to themselves: But I knew at the same time,\r\n  that in Flamstead’s British Celestial History, so long ago as the year\r\n  1690, the name of attendant (or satellite) was assumed by Flamstead;\r\n  when that great man had not even thought of the proper motion of the\r\n  fixed stars.\r\n\r\n  Other astronomers, since the time of Halley, so far as they examined\r\n  the proper motion of the fixed stars, have followed the Halleian\r\n  method, in a comparison of their own observations with those of the\r\n  ancients. This method requires long and laborious calculations; and\r\n  continues liable to many doubts, on account of its uncertainty, as\r\n  well by reason of the inaccurate nature of the instruments, as of the\r\n  observations of the ancients. But this is not the case with my new\r\n  method; from which, by means of the variation observed between the\r\n  satellite and its brighter fixed star, it necessarily results, that\r\n  the appropriate motion, either of the one star or the other, is to be\r\n  attributed to it. Hence it is, that, within two years past, I have\r\n  observed almost two hundred attendants of divers fixed stars; moving\r\n  nearly in the same parallel, immediately before or after their\r\n  respective fixed stars: and I have communicated many observations of\r\n  this kind to the celebrated English astronomer, Nevil Maskelyne, who\r\n  assures me they prove highly acceptable to him.\r\n\r\n  From amongst many of my observations, I transmit to your illustrious\r\n  society a few, by way of specimen; the corresponding observations to\r\n  which, I find in the Britannic Celestial History of Flamstead; whence\r\n  at the same time it is obvious, that observations of this kind are\r\n  eminently useful, for the purpose of discovering the proper motion of\r\n  such stars.\r\n\r\n  [The Table, containing the Observations here referred to, will be\r\n  found in the second volume of the Society’s Transactions, annexed to\r\n  Mr. Mayer’s communication: he then proceeds thus, referring to that\r\n  Table.]\r\n\r\n  The first and second left-hand column of the following Table are\r\n  easily understood, from the title. The third column shews the\r\n  difference of right ascension, in mean time, between the star and its\r\n  satellite: The attendant, preceding the fixed star, is set down in the\r\n  first place, in the table; the attendant, following, is placed after\r\n  its fixed star. The fourth column notes the difference between the\r\n  fixed star and its attendant, as I have observed it at Manheim. The\r\n  letter A denotes, that the attendant is to the southward; letter B\r\n  more northward. The following columns contain the observations of the\r\n  same star, made by Flamstead.\r\n\r\n  It appears from the whole of the observations, that, of all the stars,\r\n  Arcturus is carried with the greatest celerity, by his own motion,\r\n  westward; since the same attendant, which in Flamstead’s time, on the\r\n  14th of February, 1690, preceded Arcturus 5″ in time, now enters the\r\n  meridian 6″ after him. From the diminished difference also, of\r\n  declination between Arcturus and his attendant, it is evident, that\r\n  Arcturus progresses annually, by his own appropriate motion, nearly 2″\r\n  in a circular course, towards the south. From this it clearly results,\r\n  that the declination of the attendant, as observed by me, reduced to\r\n  the parallel of Greenwich, produces the same altitude of the Greenwich\r\n  pole, as that deduced from Flamstead’s observation; but not so, the\r\n  declination of Arcturus, observed at the present day, even with the\r\n  aberration and nutation corrected.\r\n\r\n  A similar investigation may be made, with respect to the other fixed\r\n  stars and their attendants; and, from the comparison already begun\r\n  with other fixed stars, it may be ascertained whether an appropriate\r\n  motion is to be attributed to the fixed star or its attendant, or to\r\n  both.\r\n\r\n  All my observations are made in a meridienal plane with a mural\r\n  quadrant, at Manheim, in his Serene Highness the Elector Palatine’s\r\n  new Observatory, erected for me: its longitude, East from Greenwich,\r\n  is nearly 34′ 6″, in time; its latitude, nearly 49° 27′ 50″.\r\n\r\n  It will give me very great pleasure, if I shall learn that these\r\n  observations of mine do not prove unacceptable to your illustrious\r\n  society: to whose goodness I most respectfully commend myself; being\r\n  ever the very devoted admirer and humble servant of your illustrious\r\n  and celebrated Society.\r\n\r\n                                               CHRISTIAN MAYER,\r\n                           Astronomer to his Serene Highness the Elector\r\n                                   Palatine and Duke of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n                                  _Manheim, in Germany, April 24, 1778._\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n _Letter from Mr. Rittenhouse to Professor Mayer of Manheim, in Germany._\r\n\r\n                                      _Philadelphia, August 20th. 1779._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\n  I am directed by the Philosophical Society to acknowledge your letter\r\n  of the 24th of April, 1778, and to return you their thanks for\r\n  communicating the Observations it contains, wishing you success in\r\n  further prosecuting so curious a Discovery.

All\r\n  that I propose is, to place this grand mechanical problem in another\r\n  light, wherein it will appear more feasible.\r\n\r\n  If a ball of earth, weighing 200 pounds, were left at liberty near the\r\n  surface of this globe, it would descend, by its own gravity, about 15\r\n  feet in one second of time, and about 20 miles in 80 seconds: And if,\r\n  as this gentleman supposes, there are about 2000 trillions of such\r\n  balls in the whole Earth,—the Earth, by their mutual attractions, in\r\n  80 seconds of time; will move toward the ball 1/1736,000,000,000,000\r\n  of an inch; and if the same force were to act continually for 105\r\n  years, it would move about one inch. Therefore, the force wherewith a\r\n  man acts, when he lifts a weight of 200 pounds, if applied without\r\n  intermission for the space of 105 years, is sufficient, without any\r\n  machinery, to move the Earth one inch in that time;[A42] and it must,\r\n  from the velocity received by that force alone, continue for ever\r\n  after to move at the rate of one inch in about 50 years.\r\n\r\n                                                             A MECHANIC.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A42:\r\n\r\n  Mr. T. T. proceeding on a different supposition, has computed\r\n  twenty-seven billions of years necessary for that purpose.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n         _Letter from Mr. Rittenhouse, to the Rev. Mr. Barton._\r\n\r\n                                            _Norriton, July 20th. 1768._\r\n\r\n  Dear Brother,\r\n\r\n  In Hall and Sellers’ paper of last Thursday, we have some curious\r\n  remarks on an Essay for finding the Longitude, lately published in the\r\n  Pennsylvania Chronicle, and which I had before seen in the London\r\n  papers.\r\n\r\n  The first remark is no doubt just, and is perhaps the only one made,\r\n  which Mr. Wood’s essay gave just occasion for; how he could commit\r\n  such a mistake, is not easy to conceive. But the remarker immediately\r\n  charges him with another: for he tells us, that he (Mr. Wood I\r\n  suppose) says, that Mr. Harrison’s Machines were finished about\r\n  Christmas 1765; whereas his father (whether Wood’s father or\r\n  Harrison’s, is not clear,) made three, which the remarker saw in\r\n  motion about 18 years since. He then proceeds to assure us, (by the\r\n  spirit of prophecy I presume, at least I cannot conceive how he could\r\n  come by this piece of knowledge in a natural way,) that neither the\r\n  father or his son will ever be able to finish their machines.\r\n\r\n  A machine, says the remarker, to measure the mean motion, will be far\r\n  preferable to any other method yet proposed; and immediately\r\n  afterwards he confesses, he cannot conceive that a true meridian can\r\n  be found at sea, to several minutes. Now this “uncertain error” must\r\n  certainly affect any other machine for that purpose, as well as Wood’s\r\n  Sand-Glass, and exceed the error occasioned by turning the glass\r\n  somewhat quicker at one time than another. Besides, it would not be\r\n  easy to shew, why a machine to measure the Earth’s mean motion on its\r\n  axis, with respect to the Sun, will be preferable to one that will\r\n  measure the Earth’s true motion on its axis, with respect to the fixed\r\n  Stars.\r\n\r\n  I would not be thought to recommend Wood’s project. He himself takes\r\n  notice of two disadvantages attending it, viz. the wearing of the\r\n  orifice through which the sand passes, and the sand itself becoming\r\n  polished in time, so as to run more freely; to which if we add, that\r\n  perhaps it may be greatly affected by heat and cold, there seems to be\r\n  but little probability of its usefulness. Nor do I see how it can even\r\n  have the merit of being new: for the scheme itself, with all the\r\n  remarker’s objections that have any weight in them, must readily occur\r\n  to every person that thinks at all on the subject. I shall only\r\n  observe, that it appears doubtful to me, whether the remarker does not\r\n  equally deserve the censure he so freely bestows on Mr. Woods—“His\r\n  works are full of errors, and his writings of contradictions.”\r\n\r\n              *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n  I remain your affectionate brother.\r\n\r\n                                                      DAVID RITTENHOUSE.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n                    _Dr. Rittenhouse’s Chronometer._\r\n\r\nThe construction of this Time-piece is thus described by Mr. Henry\r\n    Voight, chief coiner in the Mint, heretofore an eminent clock and\r\n    watch maker in Philadelphia; an artist of great ingenuity, and well\r\n    known for the excellence of his workmanship. The description is\r\n    given in Mr. Voight’s own words.\r\n\r\n“The Clock which Dr. Rittenhouse made use of in his Observatory was a\r\nconstruction of his own. It had but three wheels in its movement, of\r\nhigh numbers. Only one pinion, without a wheel, driven by the main\r\nwheel; whose axis goes through the front plate, that carried the\r\ndial-work; and this wheel[A43] has a perpetual rochet.[A44] The seconds\r\nare eccentric, as in the common clocks.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A43:\r\n\r\n  “The main-wheel, which is fixed on the barrel on which the cat-gut\r\n  runs.” _Mr. Voight._\r\n\r\nFootnote A44:\r\n\r\n  “A perpetual rochet is a spring lying between the main-wheel, and a\r\n  plate which is so high in diameter as to be nearly of a height with\r\n  the bottom of the main-wheel teeth, and is cut with fine teeth all\r\n  round, in the shape of a fine saw. A click on an axis is fixed between\r\n  the two frame-plates, with a weak spring that forces this click into\r\n  the fine saw-teeth, which keeps the plate from moving backwards when\r\n  the clock is winding up. This fine rochet-wheel is fixed on the\r\n  barrel-arbour or axis, the same as the main-wheel. The barrel-rochet\r\n  comes close against the plate of the fine rocket, which has a click\r\n  screwed on the front, corresponding with the barrel-rochet, and a\r\n  spring above that rochet’s click, which forces that click into the\r\n  barrel-rochet’s teeth: it is this that makes the clattering noise,\r\n  which is heard when a clock is winding up: There is a middling strong\r\n  spring placed between two arms of the cross of the main-wheel, bent\r\n  like the space of the two arms between which it acts; and this spring\r\n  is as broad as the thickness of the cross-arms. One end of that spring\r\n  is fastened to the inside of the fine rochet-plate: the other end lies\r\n  on the other cross-arm, and acts on that like a gun-lock mainspring on\r\n  the cock-tumbler. When the clock or time is set a going, and the\r\n  maintaining power or weight of the fusee or barrel, this power will\r\n  raise that spring so far as to resist the maintaining power, and\r\n  becomes stationary as long as the time-piece is going; and when it is\r\n  wound up, this spring in the main-wheel cross will expand itself,\r\n  press on the cross-arm, and force that wheel forward, with nearly the\r\n  same power as the maintaining power would give: the click for the\r\n  fine-teethed rochet falls into one of those fine teeth, and keeps that\r\n  rochet steady, without having the least motion, as long as the\r\n  winding-up of the clock continues; and by this means a time-piece can\r\n  lose no time in winding up: hence it is called a perpetual rochet;\r\n  which requires the most accurate workmanship, in its construction.”\r\n  _Mr. Voight._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“The pallet-wheel moves outside of the back-plate, and the pallets are\r\nfastened to the rod of the pendulum, which has double suspending springs\r\nfixed in a cross-bar, to which the rod is rivetted in the middle. These\r\nsprings are suspended as in common; but they are not so long as in\r\ngeneral, and have only one-and-an-half inch free action, which keeps the\r\npendulum very steady in its vibrations.\r\n\r\n“On the rod of the pendulum there is fixed a glass tube, of the\r\nthickness of a strong thermometer-tube, and is in the whole as long as\r\nthe rod: but it is bent, about one-third upwards; like a barometer, but\r\nlonger; and upon that end, on the top, the tube is as wide again as it\r\nis below, for about one-and-an-half inch in length: the other two-thirds\r\nof the length is filled with spirits of wine; and at this end, the tube\r\nis hermetically sealed. The shorter part is filled with mercury, so high\r\nas to fill the widest part of it, about half an inch, and is not sealed\r\nbut remains open. The bend is close together, and there is no more space\r\nbetween the tubes than three-eighths of an inch.\r\n\r\n“This tube is fastened to the pendulum-rod with common sewing-thread,\r\nand rests upon two pins fixed in the bob of the pendulum, as high up as\r\npossible. The bob has no slide, but is immoveable; and the regulation of\r\nthe pendulum is performed by adding to, or diminishing the mercury, in\r\nthe part where the tube is widest.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing description of the mechanism of this\r\n    Time-piece, obligingly furnished to the Writer of these Memoirs by\r\n    Mr. Voight, he has been likewise favoured by Robert Patterson, Esq.\r\n    director of the mint, with the following account of the same\r\n    extremely accurate instrument, which will greatly assist the reader\r\n    in understanding the principles on which it is constructed.\r\n\r\n“In the Astronomical Clock made by Dr. Rittenhouse, and now in the Hall\r\nof the Philosophical Society, I do not know,” says Mr. Patterson, “that\r\nthere is any thing peculiar, which requires mentioning, except the\r\npendulum; especially the apparatus for counteracting the effects of\r\nchange of temperature.\r\n\r\n“For this purpose, there is fastened on the pendulum-rod (which is of\r\niron or steel) a glass tube of about thirty-six inches long; bent in the\r\nmiddle into two parallel branches, at the distance of about an inch from\r\neach other; the bend being placed downwards, immediately above the bob\r\nof the pendulum. The tube is open at one end, and close at the other:\r\nthe arm which is close at top is filled, within about two inches of the\r\nlower end or bend, with alcohol, and the rest of the tube, within about\r\none half of an inch of the upper extremity or open end, with mercury; a\r\nfew inches of the tube, at this extremity, being about twice the width\r\nof the rest of the tube.\r\n\r\n“Now, when the heat of the air encreases, it will expand the\r\npendulum-rod; and would thus lower the centre of oscillation, and cause\r\nthe clock to go slower: but this effect is completely counteracted, by\r\nthe expansion of the alcohol chiefly, and of the mercury in part; which\r\nequally raises the centre of oscillation; and thus preserves an equable\r\nmotion in all the variable temperatures of the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n     _Description of an Hygrometer; first contrived and used by Dr.\r\n                Rittenhouse, about the year 1782._[A45]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A45:\r\n\r\n  This description is drawn up from two separate accounts of the\r\n  instrument, with which the Writer of these Memoirs was obligingly\r\n  furnished, in writing, by Robert Patterson and the late David\r\n  Rittenhouse Waters, Esquires, of Philadelphia. Mr. Patterson mentions,\r\n  that he recollects his having seen the Hygrometer so described, in Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse’s Observatory, about thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe essential part of this Hygrometer consists of two very thin strips\r\nof wood, about a foot long and half an inch broad, glued together, in\r\nsuch a manner that the grain or fibres of the one shall be at right\r\nangles with the other; so that when this compound strip was placed in\r\nerect position, the grain of one of the pieces of wood would have a\r\nvertical, and that of the other an horizontal position. One end of this\r\nsimply constructed instrument is to be made fast to a wall, or plane\r\nboard, with the edge outward, and the other end is to be at liberty to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nThen, as moisture has little or no effect on the length of a piece of\r\nwood, or in the direction of its fibres, but a very sensible one on its\r\nbreadth, or transverse direction, especially when thin, it follows, that\r\non any increase of moisture in the air, this Hygrometer becomes bent\r\ninto a curve, convex on the side of the transverse fibres; and _vice\r\nversâ_. The degrees, from the greatest dryness to the greatest moisture,\r\nare to be marked on a curve drawn on the board or wall, described by the\r\nmotion of the free end of the Hygrometer; and an index, attached to the\r\nmoving end of it, will point out, on this graduated arch, the existing\r\nstate of the atmosphere at the moment, in relation to its condition of\r\nmoisture or dryness: The relative degree of either, on the smallest\r\nchange from the one to the other, will be indicated with much precision;\r\nand probably, with much more uniformity and truth, in the results of\r\nlong-continued observations, than can be attained to by the use of\r\nHygrometers constructed of metal, or any other substance than wood.[A46]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A46:\r\n\r\n  The second volume of the Transactions of the American Philosophical\r\n  Society contains a letter, written on the 13th of November, 1780, by\r\n  Dr. Benjamin Franklin, then in France, to Mr. Nairne, of London: but\r\n  it was not communicated to the Society, until January, 1786.\r\n\r\n  In that letter, Dr. Franklin suggests to Mr. Nairne (an eminent\r\n  optician, and mathematical instrument maker,) the idea of an\r\n  Hygrometer made of wood; in preference to metalline instruments, for\r\n  the purpose of discovering “the different degrees of humidity in the\r\n  air of different countries;”—an idea which occurred to the Doctor, in\r\n  consequence of a casual circumstance, mentioned in his letter.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Franklin supposed “a quick sensibility of the instrument, to be\r\n  rather a disadvantage” to it; “since,” says he, “to draw the desired\r\n  conclusions from it, a constant and frequent observation day and\r\n  night, in each country—when the design is, to discover the different\r\n  degrees of humidity in the air of different countries—will be\r\n  necessary for a year or years, and the mean of each different set of\r\n  observations is to be found and determined.”—“For these reasons,”\r\n  continues the Doctor, “I apprehend that a substance which, though\r\n  capable of being distended by moisture and contracted by dryness, is\r\n  so slow in receiving and parting with its humidity that the frequent\r\n  changes in the atmosphere affect it sensibly, and which therefore\r\n  should, gradually, take nearly the medium of all those changes and\r\n  preserve it constantly, would be the most proper substance, of which\r\n  to make an Hygrometer:”—and he believes _good mahogany wood_ to be\r\n  that substance. In the concluding part of this letter, Dr. Franklin\r\n  says to his correspondent: “I would beg leave to recommend to you—that\r\n  you would take a number of pieces of the closest and finest grained\r\n  mahogany that you can meet with; plane them to the thinness of about a\r\n  line, and the width of about two inches across the grain, and fix each\r\n  of the pieces in some instrument that you can contrive, which will\r\n  permit them to contract and dilate, and will shew, in sensible\r\n  degrees, by a moveable hand upon a marked scale, the otherwise less\r\n  sensible quantities of such contraction and dilatation.”\r\n\r\n  Hence it appears, that Franklin and Rittenhouse conceived an idea of\r\n  the same kind, nearly at the same time: but that the latter carried\r\n  his invention into practice, three or four years before the theory of\r\n  the former, founded on similar principles, had been announced to the\r\n  American public, or, as it is believed, was made known to any other\r\n  person than Mr. Nairne. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n_Astronomical Observations, made in the years 1776, 1777 and 1778, at\r\n  Philadelphia, by the Rev. Dr. W. Smith, and David Rittenhouse, John\r\n  Lukens, and Owen Biddle, Esquires: copied from a manuscript account of\r\n  those Observations, drawn up by Dr. Smith; never before published._\r\n\r\n                    ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS, 1776.\r\n\r\nThis year exhibiting little else but scenes of confusion and distress\r\namidst the calamities of an unhappy war, scarce any attention was paid,\r\nby the members of the American Philosophical Society, to astronomical or\r\nany other literary subjects. It was agreed, however, by Mr. Rittenhouse,\r\nMr. Lukens and myself, to look out whether Mercury would touch the Sun’s\r\ndisc the 2d of November this year; as a very small difference of\r\nlatitude from what the Tables give, would have carried the planet clear\r\nof the Sun: but, from our observation of the transit of this planet, in\r\n1769, we had reason to expect it would pass further on the Sun, than\r\nHalley’s Catalogue gives it.\r\n\r\nThe following were the observations made, viz.\r\n\r\nNov. 2d, 1776. I got ready the two f. reflector with the largest\r\nobject-glass, and shortest eye-tube, magnifying about 95 times.\r\n\r\nAt 4^h per clock—No appearance of the planet on the Sun, and did not\r\nexpect it until about half an hour past 4; but as Mr. Lukens and Mr.\r\nRittenhouse had not yet come to me in the college, I sent to hasten\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt 4^h 5′ per clock—took my eye from the tube to adjust it, and fix the\r\nsmoked glass, to give clearer vision, the atmosphere being hazy. Having\r\nfixed the smoked glass in the proper place, so as to prevent its sliding\r\nor falling with its own weight, and before I had applied my eye to the\r\ntelescope again, Mr. Rittenhouse came in; and I desired him to see if\r\nthe focus and dark glass were all suitable to his eye, as they were to\r\nmine. I had been about 4′ employed in this adjustment.\r\n\r\nAt 4^h 9′, Mr. Rittenhouse having put his eye to the tube, immediately\r\ncalled out, that he saw the planet on the Sun.\r\n\r\nAt 4^h 10′ per clock, we judged ☿ had entered one-third of his diameter\r\non the Sun.\r\n\r\nAt 4^h 17′, we clearly noted the internal contact of the limbs.\r\n\r\nAt 4^h 45′, we judged the least distance of the nearest limbs to be\r\nrather more than one diameter of ☿; or that the distance of the limbs\r\nwas 10″. We-did not apply the micrometer to make any measures; as we\r\npresumed that we could judge the distance as accurately by the eye, as\r\nit could be measured; on account of the haziness of the atmosphere and\r\nthe small altitude of the Sun. We kept viewing the planet till sun-set,\r\nthe distance of the limbs continuing so nearly the same, that we could\r\nscarce perceive any diminution thereof; though we were sure also, that\r\nit did increase above 10″.[A47]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A47:\r\n\r\n  In a table (in the 2d vol. of Lalande’s _Astronomie_,) entitled,\r\n  “_Passages de Mercure sur le Soleil, calculés pour trois siècles par\r\n  les nouvelles Tables_,” the transit of that planet, above referred to,\r\n  is thus set down by Lalande, at Paris; viz.\r\n\r\n Year.

She was\r\nexamined at noon, and found as above by the meridian mark. But this mark\r\nitself, having been lately shaken with the stormy weather, is to be\r\nre-examined, and also equal altitudes taken the following days.\r\n\r\nThe annexed micrometer measures were taken for determining the quantity\r\nof the eclipse, chiefly by Mr. Rittenhouse. More would have been taken,\r\nbut the Sun was hid under clouds for about an hour after the middle of\r\nthe eclipse, and broke out again a little before the end.\r\n\r\n                         _Micrometer Measures._\r\n\r\n       h  ′   ″ inches. tenths. 500ths.\r\n       9 15   0    2       2     6 }  distances of the cusps.\r\n         31   0    3       1     ½ }\r\n\r\n      10 17   5    1       1    14 }  enlightened parts remaining.\r\n         22   0    1       1    23 }\r\n\r\n      11 37   0    1       7     6 }\r\n         38  46    1       5    21 }  distances of the cusps.\r\n         42  26    1       2    18 }\r\n\r\n      _Continuation of the Observations for adjusting the Clock._\r\n\r\n               Jan. 11th. ☉’s  W. limb on Merid.  } [A48]\r\n                               E. limb on  do.    }\r\n                                                    —————\r\n                               Centre on   do.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A48:\r\n\r\n  The calculations are here wanting, in Dr. Smith’s MSS.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhence clock faster than mean time 0 1′ 46″ per merid. mark.\r\n\r\n  Equal Altitudes.\r\n          h  ′  ″\r\n  20th.   9 37 20     59 49 }\r\n            39  1     58  6 } Mean noon per clock 12 18 34\r\n            40 41   2 56 26 }\r\n\r\n  21st.

His history is curious, from the admiration in\r\nwhich his character was held.\r\n\r\nRittenhouse was a native of America; and, in the early part of his life,\r\nhe mingled the pursuits of science with the active employments of a\r\nfarmer and watch-maker.[A50] In 1769, he was invited by the American\r\nPhilosophical Society to join a number of gentlemen who were then\r\noccupied in making some astronomical observations, when he particularly\r\ndistinguished himself by the accuracy of his calculations and the\r\ncomprehension of his mind. He afterwards constructed an\r\nobservatory,[A51] which he superintended in person, and which was the\r\nsource of many important discoveries, as well as greatly tending to the\r\ndiffusion of knowledge in the western world. During the American war, he\r\nwas an active assertor of the cause of independence. Since the\r\nestablishment of the peace, he successively filled the offices of\r\nTreasurer of the State of Pennsylvania and Director of the National\r\nMint; in both of which capacities, he was alike distinguished for\r\nstrength of judgment and integrity of heart. He succeeded the\r\nillustrious Franklin in the office of President of the Philosophical\r\nSociety; a situation which the bent of his mind and the course of his\r\nstudies had rendered him eminently qualified to fill: and towards the\r\nclose of his days, he retired from public life to the enjoyment of\r\ndomestic happiness; when he formed a circle of private friends, who will\r\ncontinue to admire his Virtues as a Man, while the world will applaud\r\nhis Talents as a Philosopher.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A50:\r\n\r\n  He never professed the business of making watches: the first\r\n  mechanical occupation he assumed was that of a clock maker, an\r\n  employment he pursued many years, in the earlier part of his life. W.\r\n  B.\r\n\r\nFootnote A51:\r\n\r\n  Having, in the preceding note, adverted to the unimportant error in\r\n  the text, wherein our Philosopher is stated to have pursued the\r\n  employment of a watch-maker, instead of that of a clock-maker; it\r\n  becomes necessary to notice, in this place, another mistake, though\r\n  likewise an inconsiderable one, into which the liberal and candid\r\n  writer of the article, above quoted, has been led. Dr. Rittenhouse’s\r\n  Observatory, at Norriton—the place of his original residence and the\r\n  seat of his farm-house—was erected _prior_ to the celebrated\r\n  “Astronomical Observations” made by him, in the year 1769; which were\r\n  those relating to the Transit of Venus over the Sun’s disk, on the 3d\r\n  of June in that year.

Nov, 1812._\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  The following is a statement of the conversation which took place\r\n  between Drs. Sproat and Rittenhouse, mentioned by me to Bishop White.\r\n\r\n  At a time when Dr. Rittenhouse was confined by sickness to his room,\r\n  or perhaps to his bed,[A52] he sent for the Rev. Dr. Sproat to visit\r\n  him. The Doctor was somewhat surprised, on receiving the message: but\r\n  as he had made it an uniform rule to visit all who sent for him, he\r\n  expressed his surprise at being sent for; observing, that he could\r\n  offer no comfort or consolation to any person, who was not a Believer\r\n  in the Christian Religion. On hearing this declaration, Dr.\r\n  Rittenhouse immediately asked, if Dr. Sproat considered him among the\r\n  number of such? To which the Doctor answered; that the world had\r\n  generally classed him with them. Dr. Rittenhouse on hearing this, with\r\n  great mildness and a smile on his countenance, replied, that the\r\n  opinion of the world was sometimes wrong; and, as it respected\r\n  himself, he could with truth declare, that ever since he had examined\r\n  Christianity and thought upon the subject, he was a firm believer in\r\n  it; and, that he expected salvation _only_ in the way and manner, as\r\n  proposed in the Gospel.\r\n\r\n  The above is the _substance_ of what Dr. Sproat mentioned to myself;\r\n  and I might add, that when the good old man told it, his eyes\r\n  overflowed with tears of joy. It gives me pleasure to be able to\r\n  furnish you with this satisfactory proof of Dr. Rittenhouse’s faith;\r\n  and which I once introduced into a sermon preached in the city, as\r\n  justice due to the character of the deceased, and who had been\r\n  triumphantly claimed by the Infidels. I am happy to find that you are\r\n  engaged in the laudable business of writing the Life of that worthy\r\n  Man. Yours, respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                        ROBERT CATHCART.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM BARTON, ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A52:\r\n\r\n  The time above referred to, is supposed to have been in the year 1790\r\n  or 1791; though perhaps it may have been somewhat earlier. Dr. Sproat\r\n  died in the autumn of 1793. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ——]\r\n\r\n                      CHARACTER OF DR. RITTENHOUSE:\r\n\r\n _Communicated to the Author of the Memoirs of his Life, in a letter from\r\n                          Andrew Ellicott, Esq._\r\n\r\n                                       _Lancaster, December 30th, 1812._\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI felt no small degree of pleasure and satisfaction, on understanding\r\nthat you are about publishing Memoirs of the Life of Dr. Rittenhouse;\r\nknowing, from your connexion, and intimacy with him for many years, you\r\nhave it in your power to delineate, and transmit his true character and\r\na knowledge of his rare virtues to posterity, with as much, if not more\r\naccuracy than any other person. As I also have had the pleasure and\r\nadvantage of Dr. Rittenhouse’s acquaintance and friendship, I request\r\nyou to accept of the following short sketch of his character, as a small\r\ntestimony of my esteem for him when living, and of my veneration for his\r\nmemory, now he is no more. I am, dear Sir, your sincere friend,\r\n\r\n                                                        ANDREW ELLICOTT.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BARTON, Esq.\r\n\r\nI became acquainted with the late Dr. Rittenhouse, in the sixteenth year\r\nof my age, being first introduced to him, after he removed to the city\r\nof Philadelphia, by the late Joseph Galloway, Esq. and my Father; both\r\nof whom were sincerely attached to him, not only on account of his\r\nscientific talents and acquirements, but for his public and private\r\nvirtues. From that period, to the end of his life, we enjoyed an\r\nuninterrupted friendship.\r\n\r\nIn my scientific pursuits, I was frequently aided by him; particularly,\r\nin that part which relates to Astronomy, with which he was better\r\nacquainted, both in theory and practice, than any other person in this\r\ncountry; and when he ceased to calculate the Almanacks for the middle\r\nstates, at his request I continued them several years.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1784 and 1785, Dr. Rittenhouse and myself were engaged in\r\ndetermining the boundaries between this commonwealth and the state of\r\nVirginia; and in the year 1786, in determining the boundary between this\r\ncommonwealth and the state of New-York. In those arduous employments, I\r\nhad many opportunities of witnessing his address in overcoming the\r\nnumerous difficulties we necessarily had to encounter, in the then\r\nwilderness, in which our operations were performed.\r\n\r\nAs a gentleman of general science, Dr. Rittenhouse would have held a\r\nrespectable rank in any country; but as a Mechanist and Astronomer, he\r\nhas had but few equals. It has been frequently asked,—why he has not\r\nleft more evidences of his talents, for the use of posterity? In answer\r\nto this question, it is to be observed, that almost from his childhood,\r\nhe had a complaint in his breast; which increased so much with his age,\r\nthat for the last fifteen years of his life,—and in which he had the\r\nmost leisure for composition,—it was painful for him to support the\r\nposition a person must occupy, when writing. This circumstance I have\r\nfrequently heard him lament, in a feeling manner; as it prevented him\r\nfrom answering letters with promptitude, and writing to his friends as\r\noften as he wished.\r\n\r\nThough Dr. Rittenhouse had not the advantage of a liberal education, he\r\nwrote not only correctly but with ease: he made himself master of the\r\nGerman language, to which he was partial: and of the French, so far as\r\nto read the scientific works in that tongue, with facility.\r\n\r\nAs an Husband, and a Father, he might be taken as an example and a\r\npattern, in the most virtuous community that ever existed. He was a good\r\nCitizen,—and warm and sincere in his friendships; and though reserved in\r\nlarge mixed companies, he was cheerful and communicative, when in a\r\nsmall circle of his friends. His mind appeared formed for contemplation,\r\nand therefore not calculated for the noisy and busy scenes of this\r\nworld: from this placid turn of mind, he had a singular antipathy to all\r\nmobs and riots; and I recollect to have heard him speak of the riots of\r\nthe Paxton-boys, (as they were called,) with greater acrimony than on\r\nany other occasion,—more than twenty years after they happened. Being a\r\nphilanthropist by nature, he wished the happiness and welfare of the\r\nwhole human race; and viewed slavery, in all its forms, with feelings of\r\nhorrour: from this attachment to the happiness, the rights, and the\r\nliberty of his fellow-creatures, he was led to take an active and useful\r\npart in favour of our revolution, which separated the colonies (now the\r\nUnited States,) from the mother-country.\r\n\r\nHis contemplative mind naturally carried him to piety; but his\r\nliberality was so great, that he did not appear to give a very decided\r\npreference to any one of the sects into which Christianity is divided:\r\nhe practised the morality of a sincere Christian, without troubling\r\nhimself about the dogmas of the different churches.\r\n\r\nHis manners were plain and unassuming, though not without a sufficient\r\nshare of dignity; and, from a consciousness of his own talents, he did\r\nnot envy those of others.\r\n\r\nIt has too frequently happened, for the honour of science and\r\nliterature, that men of great and commanding talents, have been\r\nobstinately dogmatical, and impatient of contradiction;—of those\r\nblemishes, Dr. Rittenhouse had not the least tincture.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,—if Dr. Rittenhouse was not the greatest man, of the age,\r\nhis character has fewer blemishes in it; and, if his talents were not of\r\nthat kind which are usually considered the most _brilliant_, they\r\nwere—like those of WASHINGTON—of the most _solid_ and _useful_ order.\r\n\r\n_Some particulars concerning the Residence, the Tomb, &c. of Copernicus:\r\n  communicated to the late Dr. Rittenhouse, Pres. A. P. S. by the Earl\r\n  of Buchan._\r\n\r\n“In the year 1777,” says his Lordship, “my learned friend John\r\nBernouilli, of Berlin, on one of his tours having happened to meet with\r\nthe Bishop of Warmia,[A53] in the Abbey of Oliva, near Dantzic, was\r\ninformed by that prelate, that he had the pleasure to discover, in the\r\nCathedral of Frauenburg, the Tomb of Copernicus, so long fruitlessly\r\nsought for.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A53:\r\n\r\n  An uncle of Copernicus was Bishop of _Warmia_, (in Ermeland, a little\r\n  province of Poland,) and gave him a canonry in his cathedral of\r\n  Frawenberg, a city in ducal Prussia, situated on the Frische Haff, at\r\n  the mouth of the Vistula: it was there he began to devote himself to\r\n  astronomy, at the age of twenty-eight years. His great work, _De\r\n  Revolutionibus Orbium Cœlestium_, was completed about the year 1530:\r\n  but his apprehensions of meeting with persecution from the bigotted\r\n  ignorance of the age, in consequence of the system he therein\r\n  promulgated, deterred him from publishing it until thirteen years\r\n  after that period; and it is supposed that the agitation of his mind,\r\n  occasioned by its appearance in the world, produced the sudden\r\n  effusion of blood, which terminated his life on the 24th day of May,\r\n  in the year 1543. W. B.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n“In the year 1778, Mr. Bernouilli having occasion to pass through\r\nFrauenburg, on his road to St. Petersburg, did not fail to visit the\r\nCathedral, and explore the Monument of Copernicus. Acquainted with no\r\none in the place, he was yet lucky enough to meet with a Canon, in the\r\nstreet, whose countenance invited him to accost him on this subject, and\r\nwho proved very attentive to his researches. He informed him, that as\r\nfor the Ashes of Copernicus, they were mingled in the charnel-house with\r\nthe bones of the fraternity of the Canons; but that, for the Tombstone\r\nof the Philosopher, it was no more than a tablet of marble, simple, as\r\nthe mode was of his days, and had no other inscription than these\r\nwords—NIC. COPERNICUS, THOR:—-That this tablet had remained hidden for\r\nsome time, in rubbish; and when recovered, was placed in the\r\nchapter-house, till a more suitable place should be destined for it. Mr.\r\nBernouilli expresses his regret to me, that he had not urged the Canon\r\nto indulge him with a sight of this Stone; and to look for a further\r\ninscription, to support the assertion of Gassendi, who mentions (page\r\n325), That the Bishop Martin Cromer, an eminent Polish historian, caused\r\na mural marble monument to be inscribed and erected to the memory of\r\nCopernicus, with the following inscription:\r\n\r\n                                D. O. M.\r\n                        R. D. NICOLAO COPERNICO,\r\n                          Torunensi, Artium et\r\n                           Medicinæ Doctori,\r\n                          Canonico Warmiensi,\r\n                         Præsenti Astrologo, et\r\n                            Ejus Disciplinæ\r\n                             Instauratori;\r\n                           MARTINUS CROMERUS,\r\n                         Episcopus Warmiensis,\r\n                      Honoris, et ad Posteritatem\r\n                        Memoriæ, Causâ, posuit;\r\n                          M. D. L. X. X. X. I.\r\n\r\n“Gassendi adds, that this Monument was not erected until thirty-six\r\nyears after the death of Copernicus, which does not agree with this date\r\nof 1581.\r\n\r\n“The good Canon informed Bernouilli, that he was lodged in the apartment\r\nof Copernicus, of which he was very proud; and invited the Prussian\r\nPhilosopher to visit him in that place, which he accordingly did; and\r\nwas shewn by the Canon another place, above the Dormitories, which had\r\nbeen used by Copernicus as his study and observatory, in which the Canon\r\nhad a portrait of that eminent man, concerning the original of which he\r\nwould not say. This little Observatory had an extensive view; but when\r\nCopernicus had occasion for one more extensive, he was wont to observe\r\non the gallery of the steeple, which communicates with this place.\r\n\r\n“Charmed with these classic footsteps, Bernouilli forgot to look at the\r\nMonument on the chapter-house, above mentioned. In a repository\r\nadjoining to the Cathedral, the Canon shewed Bernouilli the remains of a\r\nhydraulic machine said to have been invented and used by Copernicus. The\r\nconstruction seemed interesting, but in great disrepair; and Bernouilli\r\nhad not leisure to examine it particularly. The use of the machine was\r\nto force and convey water into the most elevated apartments of the house\r\nof the Canons, who are now under the necessity of having it fetched from\r\na distance, from the lower Town.”\r\n\r\n“I remember to have seen (says Bernouilli), in some old German Journal,\r\nthat the Library of the ancient town of Konigsberg contained some books,\r\nchiefly mathematical, which were part of the Library of Copernicus; and\r\nalso his Portrait, which had been purchased at Thorn, where the remains\r\nof his family still possessed the house in which he was born, as late as\r\nthe year 1720. In P. Freher’s _Theatrum Virorum eruditorum_, there is a\r\nChronostick on the year of Copernicus’s death, 1543. p. 1447.\r\n\r\n                 eX hoC eXCessIt trIstI CopernICVs eVo,\r\n                 IngenIo astronVM et CognItIone potens.\r\n\r\n“In the above mentioned book, p. 1442, there is a neat little Print of\r\nCopernicus. In Hartknoch’s _Alter und newes Preusen_, here is a print of\r\nCopernicus, from a picture on wood which hangs in what they call his\r\nCenotaph, at Thorn; and which represents him kneeling, in his\r\ncanonicals, before a Crucifix;—and below this portrait are these\r\n_sapphic_ verses:\r\n\r\n                   Non parem Pauli gratiam requiro,\r\n                   Veniam Petri neque posco; sed quam\r\n                   In Crucis ligno dederas sationi,\r\n                                 Sedulus oro.\r\n\r\n                           (_a little lower_)\r\n\r\nNicolao Copernico, Thoruniensi, absolutæ subtilitatis mathematico, ne\r\ntanti viri apud exteros celeb. in sua patria periret memoria, hoc\r\nmonumentum positum.\r\n\r\n              Mort.

D.,\r\nwho died in 1589.\r\n\r\n“On the same altar-piece, or picture, is represented the portrait of\r\nJohn D’Albert, with the following inscription.\r\n\r\nIllustris Princeps Dn. Joh.

VIII.\r\n\r\n“Upon the whole,” concludes Lord Buchan, “it appears the likeness I\r\nsend, of _Copernicus_, is most to be depended on; and, as such, I\r\nflatter myself it will be an _Heir-loom to infant America_! Concerning\r\nNapier, it is needless for me to enlarge; the learned Dr. Minto having\r\nenabled me to do justice to his memory.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlthough the following particulars respecting Dr. Rittenhouse were not\r\n  communicated by the writer, Professor Barton, until it was too late to\r\n  give them a place in the body of the work, the Author nevertheless is\r\n  glad to have an opportunity of presenting to the public, even at the\r\n  close of his book, the interesting circumstances this communication\r\n  contains.\r\n\r\nAs Optics were one of his favourite studies, so he at one time\r\ncontemplated a course of public, and I think popular, lectures on this\r\nbeautiful and important branch of physics. On this subject he mentioned\r\nto me his intention in the winter of 1785-1786. The enthusiasm, indeed,\r\nwith which he developed his design, and I may add the warmth of zeal\r\nwith which his manner at the time inspired me, I can never forget. And,\r\nindeed, I cannot but regret, that our excellent friend never made his\r\nappearance in publick, as a LECTURER. As such, he would, unquestionably,\r\nhave greatly advanced the love and the knowledge of natural philosophy\r\nin the United-States. He may, perhaps, have wanted some of the\r\nqualifications of a popular teacher. He would not have aspired to\r\nfinished eloquence of style: to the eloquence of gesture and of manner,\r\nhe was still more a stranger. But there is an eloquence of physiognomy,\r\nwhich Mr. Rittenhouse most eminently possessed. The modesty and amenity\r\nof his manner would have effected much, whether his audience had been a\r\nclass of philosophers, or an assembly of ladies. Of his own discoveries,\r\nand opinions, and theories, he would have always spoken with that sweet\r\nand modest reserve, for which he was ever distinguished. He would have\r\ndwelt with the most generous and ample enthusiasm upon the great\r\ndiscoveries of Newton; and if, at any time, he could have forgotten that\r\nimpartial conduct, which it is the duty of the historian of a science to\r\nobserve, it would have been when he might have had occasion to defend\r\nthe theories of that great man, against the objections of succeeding and\r\nminor philosophers.\r\n\r\nIn Physics, Newton was his favourite author. Of HIM he ever spoke with a\r\nspecies of respect bordering upon veneration. He considered him as one\r\nof those few great leaders in science whose discoveries and services can\r\nnever be forgotten: whose fame, instead of diminishing, is destined to\r\nbe augmented, with the progress of time. I had many opportunities of\r\nbeing witness to the exalted opinion which he entertained of the\r\nimmortal British philosopher. He read Dr. Bancroft’s objections to some\r\nparts of Sir Isaac’s theory of colours, with a firm conviction, that the\r\nNewtonian principles were still unshaken: and I well remember, that he\r\nonce referred me to a paper which he had published, in one of our\r\nmagazines, in answer to some objections which the late Dr. Witherspoon\r\nhad urged against some of the theories of Newton.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by a celebrated writer, that mathematicians in\r\ngeneral read but little of each other’s works. This remark, if I mistake\r\nnot, is very strongly illustrated in Mr. Rittenhouse. However it may\r\nhave been in his earlier age, I am confident that during the last\r\nthirteen years of his life, when my intercourse with him was great, and\r\nindeed but little interrupted; I am confident, that at this matured and\r\nauspicious era of his life, our friend was not a laborious student. He\r\nlooked into many books, and he often passed quickly from one kind of\r\nreading to another: from philosophy to poetry; from poetry perhaps to\r\nphilosophy again. His reading may be said to have been desultory. I have\r\nlittle doubt that this rather irregular manner of reading was, in some\r\nmeasure, the result of his extreme delicacy of constitution, which\r\nrendered a more unvaried application to any one kind of reading, irksome\r\nand oppressive. Often have I seen him lay down his book or pen, to\r\nrecline upon his sopha, the circumscribed flush upon his cheeks plainly\r\nindicating the physical state of his feelings. A short repose would\r\nenable him to return to his studies again.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse’s application to books, had, no doubt, been more regular\r\nand constant in the earlier part of his life; before I knew him well, or\r\nbefore I had accustomed myself to watch the progress of his mind. He\r\nwas, certainly, profoundly, acquainted with the Principia and other\r\nwritings of Newton, which he read partly in the original, and partly\r\nthrough the medium of translation. And although, within the period of my\r\nbetter acquaintance with him, his reading I have said, was not intense,\r\nhe suffered no important discovery in philosophy to escape his notice.\r\nAlthough his own library was small, he had ample opportunities, through\r\nthe medium of the valuable library belonging to the Philosophical\r\nSociety, and other collections in Philadelphia, of observing the\r\nprogress of his favourite studies in Europe. He took much interest in\r\nthe discoveries of Mr. Herschel, whose papers he eagerly read as they\r\narrived from Europe: and I well remember the time (in 1785) when he was\r\nengaged in reading Scheel’s work on Fire, which had recently appeared,\r\nin an English dress. He then assured me, that some of this great Swedish\r\nphilosopher’s notions concerning the nature and the laws of heat, had\r\nlong before suggested themselves to his mind.\r\n\r\nThe chemical discoveries of Crawford and Priestley solicited some of Mr.\r\nRittenhouse’s attention, about the year 1785-1786, and for some time\r\nafter. The brilliant discoveries of Priestley, in particular, were not\r\nunknown to him. Upon the arrival of this illustrious philosopher in\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1794, Mr. Rittenhouse stood foremost among the members\r\nof the Philosophical Society in publicly welcoming the exiled\r\nphilosopher to the country which he had chosen as the asylum of his\r\ndeclining years; and in expressing his high sense of his estimable\r\ncharacter, and of the vast accessions which he had brought to science. I\r\noften met Dr. Priestley at the house of our friend. Their regard for\r\neach other was mutual. It is to be regretted that their immediate\r\nintercourse with each other could not be more frequent. Priestley had\r\nunfortunately chosen the wilderness, instead of the capital or its\r\nvicinity, as his place of residence: and Rittenhouse, alas! did not live\r\ntwo years after the arrival of Priestley in America.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Mr. Rittenhouse, Dr. Priestley wrote me a letter of\r\ncondolence on the great loss which the publick had sustained; on the\r\nirreparable loss which I, in particular, had suffered. When the Doctor\r\nafterwards returned from Northumberland to Philadelphia, he discovered\r\nmuch solicitude to know from me Mr. Rittenhouse’s religious sentiments,\r\nand the manner and circumstances of his death; and he evinced no small\r\nsatisfaction in receiving from me that relation which I have already\r\ngiven you, of the last hours, and of the last words, of one of the best\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse had not studied natural history as a science: but to\r\nsome of the branches of this science he had paid particular attention;\r\nand upon some of them he was capable of conversing with the ablest, and\r\nthe most experienced. In Botany, he was not acquainted with the\r\nscientific or classical names: but the habits, and in many instances,\r\nthe properties of plants were known to him. I well recollect how great\r\nwere his pleasure and satisfaction, in contemplating the _Flora_ of the\r\nrich hills of Weeling, and other branches of the Ohio, when I\r\naccompanied him into those parts of our union, in the year 1785. In this\r\nwilderness, he first fostered my love and zeal for natural history. Upon\r\nhis return from the woods, in the month of October, he brought with him,\r\nas ornaments to his garden, many of the transmontain plants of the state\r\nof Pennsylvania: and long before I knew that it grew wild in the\r\nvicinity of Philadelphia, upon the banks of his native Schuylkill, he\r\nhad naturalized in his garden, the beautiful Silene virginica, which he\r\ndesignated with the name of “Weeling Star.”\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, that in the last months of his life he devoted a good deal\r\nof his time to an examination of the structure of the most important\r\norgans of plants. Acquainted with that doctrine which forms the basis of\r\nthe sexual system, he was fond of examining plants during the period of\r\ntheir inflorescence: and I remember, with what apparent pleasure, he\r\npointed out to me the tube in the styles of some of the plants which\r\ngrew in his garden.\r\n\r\nHe had made many observations upon the buds of trees, some of which I\r\nthink were new. I regret that the memorandums which he kept of these\r\nobservations have not been found among his papers.\r\n\r\nNot fifteen days before his death, he had finished the perusal of a\r\nGerman translation of Rousseau’s beautiful letters on Botany, which I\r\nhad put into his hands.\r\n\r\nMr. Rittenhouse, like Newton and many other men of great talents,\r\nemployed much of his time in the perusal of works on the subject of\r\nnatural and revealed religion. This was, I think, more especially the\r\ncase in the latter part of his life. Among other books which I could\r\nmention, I well recollect that he read the _Thoughts_ of the celebrated\r\nFrench philosopher Pascall: and he acknowledged, that he read them with\r\npleasure. But that pleasure, he observed to me, was diminished, when he\r\nlearned, what was often the state of Pascall’s mind:—a state of\r\nmelancholy and gloom: and sometimes even of mental derangement. At the\r\ntime of his death, the American Philosopher was engaged in the perusal\r\nof Mosheim’s Ecclesiastical History: and he had just before finished the\r\nperusal of the _Meditations_ of the Emperor Marcus Antoninus; that\r\nexcellent work, replete with the sublimest morality, and with much of a\r\nsublime religion.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks before his death, I had put into his hands the first\r\nvolume of Dr. Ferguson’s _Elements of Moral and Political Science_. I\r\ntook the liberty of particularly directing his attention to the last\r\nchapter of the volume: the chapter on the future state. He read it with\r\nso much satisfaction, that he afterwards sent it to his elder daughter,\r\nwith a request that she would peruse it.\r\n\r\nThe benevolent dispositions of our friend were well known to you. You\r\nhave, doubtless, done justice to this portion of his character; yet\r\npermit me to mention a few detached facts, which have came under my own\r\nimmediate notice, and the relation of which may serve to augment even\r\n_your_ respect and veneration for Mr. Rittenhouse.\r\n\r\nThe year 1793 is memorable in the history of Philadelphia. During the\r\nprevalence of the yellow fever, in the summer of that year, Mr.\r\nRittenhouse wrote to me a note requesting me to visit a number of poor\r\npeople, in his vicinity, labouring under the malignant fever; and making\r\nit a condition of my attendance upon them, that I should charge _him_\r\nfor my services.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March of the same year, I had a good deal of\r\nconversation with Mr. Rittenhouse, on the subject of penal laws. He did\r\nnot think that the late judge Bradford, whose essay on this subject he\r\ngreatly admired, and recommended to my perusal, was too lenient in his\r\nviews of the subject. He observed, that although he had often served on\r\njuries, he thanked God, that he never had in any case where life and\r\ndeath were immediately involved; observing, that his conscience would\r\n_ever_ reproach him, if he had, in any instance, given his verdict for\r\ndeath. “Of all murders (he added) _legal_ murders are the most horrid.”\r\nHe did not think that death ought to be the punishment for any crime.\r\n\r\nThe union of sensibility with benevolence is frequently observed. The\r\nsensibility of Rittenhouse was exquisitely nice; perhaps, I might say,\r\nit was somewhat morbid. In a conversation which I had with him on the\r\nsubject of the analogies between animals and vegetables, when I had\r\nobserved to him, that the further we push our inquiries into this\r\ninteresting subject, the more reason we have for supposing, that those\r\ntwo series of living beings constitute, as many eminent naturalists have\r\nsupposed, but one vast family, he said it appeared so to him, but he\r\nhoped it would never be discovered that vegetables are endowed with\r\nsensibility. “There is, he observed, already too much of this in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nHis religion was sublime and pure. It had no tincture of superstition or\r\ncredulity. Accustomed, from an early period of his life, to contemplate\r\nthe largest and the smallest objects of Creation; and with respect to\r\nthe former to view their arrangement and harmony in the construction of\r\na system of immeasurable extent; in these objects and in these places,\r\nhe beheld one of the revelations of our Creator. He could not be\r\ninsensible of the ills, infirmities, and miseries of human life, and\r\neven of the life of inferior animals. But still he discovered, as he\r\noften observed to me, the existence and even the dominion of much\r\nbenevolence through the world. He was wont to consider our benevolent\r\ndispositions, and our virtuous affections, as among the strongest proofs\r\nof the existence of a Creator. These dispositions, these affections, and\r\nour intellectual powers, are the genuine emanations of a God.\r\n\r\n                                                  BENJAMIN SMITH BARTON.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia, December, 1813.\r\n\r\n   _Letter from Lady Juliana Penn to the Rev. Peter Miller, Ephrata._\r\n\r\n                                                    _Septr. 29th. 1774._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your very respectable character would make me ashamed to address you\r\n  with words merely of form. I hope therefore you will not suspect me of\r\n  using any such, when I assure you I received the favour of your letter\r\n  with very great pleasure. And permit me, sir, to join the thanks I owe\r\n  to those worthy women, the holy sisters at Ephrata, with those I now\r\n  present to you, for the good opinion you, and they, are pleased to\r\n  have of me. I claim only that of respecting merit, where I find it;\r\n  and of wishing an increase in the world, of that piety to the\r\n  Almighty, and peace to our fellow-creatures, that I am convinced is in\r\n  your hearts: and, therefore, do me the justice to believe, you have my\r\n  wishes of prosperity here, and happiness hereafter.\r\n\r\n  I did not receive the precious stone, you were so goad to send me,\r\n  till yesterday. I am most extremely obliged to you for it. It deserves\r\n  to be particularly distinguished on its own, as well as the giver’s\r\n  account. I shall keep it with a grateful remembrance of my obligations\r\n  to you.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Penn, as well as myself, were much obliged to you for remarking to\r\n  us, that the paper you wrote on, was the manufacture of Ephrata: It\r\n  had, on that account, great merit to us; and he has desired our\r\n  friend, Mr. Barton, to send him some specimens of the occupation of\r\n  some of your society. He bids me say, that he rejoices to hear of your\r\n  and their welfare.\r\n\r\n  It is I that should beg pardon for interrupting your quiet, and\r\n  profitable moments, by an intercourse so little beneficial as mine;\r\n  but trust your benevolence will indulge this satisfaction to one who\r\n  wishes to assure you, sir, that she is, with sincere regard, your\r\n  obliged and faithful well-wisher,\r\n\r\n                                                           JULIANA PENN.\r\n\r\n  MR. PETER MILLER, President of the Cloister at Ephrata.\r\n\r\n _To the Memory of the Honourable Thomas Penn, Esq. who died March 21.\r\n                                 1775._\r\n\r\n          Peace, worthy shade! Peace to thy virtuous soul;\r\n          Life’s contest past, thou now hast gain’d the goal,\r\n          Destin’d for honest innate truth, like thine,\r\n          Where moral goodness rises to divine.\r\n            True to thy friendship, sacred to each trust,\r\n          In every duty most exactly just:\r\n          A princely wealth fill’d not thy heart with pride,\r\n          Thou nobly cast the glitt’ring bait aside;\r\n          Made it subservient to some useful aim,\r\n          Some gen’rous purpose, or some proper claim:\r\n          As bounteous streams in pleasing currents glide,\r\n          It roll’d, refreshing, like some charming tide;\r\n          Cheer’d the lone widow in her humble dome,\r\n          And scatter’d comfort o’er her lonely home.\r\n          Thy guardian angel snatch’d thee from below,\r\n          E’er Pennsylvania was consign’d to woe:\r\n          Thou now may’st view, without one kindred tear,\r\n          What we deem harsh, oppressive and severe;—\r\n          Life’s motley picture, at one view, may’st scan,—\r\n          Unwind its tangled, complicated plan,—\r\n          Where this great truth is clearly understood,\r\n          That “partial evil’s universal good.”\r\n          In broken parts, man the dark system spies,\r\n          While all lies open to celestial eyes;\r\n          The links, united, of our scatter’d chain,\r\n          Shew why PENN suffer’d tedious years of pain,—\r\n          Shew why one patient virtuous mind doth mourn,\r\n          And why sweet Peace is from a people torn.\r\n          For, individuals of earth’s humble vale\r\n          Mount, in gradation, on a heav’nly scale:\r\n          Yet _Virtue_, only, has a charm in death;\r\n          Wealth droops his plumes, as man resigns his breath;\r\n          Its social merits can’t ascend the skies,\r\n          Terrestrial substance can’t to heav’n arise;\r\n          Too gross to enter the abodes divine,\r\n          In earthly darkness it can only shine.\r\n\r\n    _Letter from General Washington to the Writer of these Memoirs._\r\n\r\n                                         _Mount Vernon, Sep. 7th. 1788._\r\n\r\n  Sir,\r\n\r\n  At the same time I announce to you the receipt of your obliging letter\r\n  of the 28th of last month, which covered an ingenious essay on\r\n  Heraldry, I have to acknowledge my obligations for the sentiments your\r\n  partiality has been indulgent enough to form of me, and my thanks for\r\n  the terms in which your urbanity has been pleased to express them.\r\n\r\n  Imperfectly acquainted with the subject, as I profess myself to be;\r\n  and persuaded of your skill, as I am; it is far from my design to\r\n  intimate an opinion, that Heraldry, Coat-Armour, &c, might not be\r\n  rendered conducive to public and private uses, with us,—or, that they\r\n  can have any tendency _unfriendly to the purest spirit of\r\n  Republicanism_: on the contrary, a different conclusion is deducible\r\n  from the practice of Congress and the States; all of which have\r\n  established some kind of _Armorial Devices_, to authenticate their\r\n  official instruments. But, sir, you must be sensible, that political\r\n  sentiments are very various among the people in the several states;\r\n  and that a formidable opposition to what appears to be the prevailing\r\n  sense of the Union, is but just declining into peaceable acquiescence.\r\n  While, therefore, the minds of a certain portion of the community\r\n  (possibly from turbulent or sinister views) are, or affect to be,\r\n  haunted with the very _spectre of innovation_;—while they are\r\n  indefatigably striving to make the credulity of the less-informed part\r\n  of the citizens subservient to their schemes, in believing that the\r\n  proposed General Government is pregnant with the seeds of\r\n  Discrimination, Oligarchy and Despotism;—while they are clamourously\r\n  endeavouring to propagate an idea, that those whom they wish,\r\n  invidiously, to designate by the name of the “well-born,” are\r\n  meditating in the first instance to distinguish themselves from their\r\n  compatriots, and to wrest the dearest privileges from the bulk of the\r\n  people; and while the apprehensions of _some_, who have demonstrated\r\n  themselves the sincere, but too jealous, friends of Liberty, are\r\n  feelingly alive to the effects of the actual Revolution and too much\r\n  inclined to coincide with the prejudices above described,—it might not\r\n  perhaps be advisable to stir any question that would tend to reanimate\r\n  the dying embers of faction, or blow the dormant spark of jealousy\r\n  into an inextinguishable flame. I need not say, that the deplorable\r\n  consequences would be the same, allowing there should be no real\r\n  foundation for jealousy: (in the judgment of sober reason,) as if\r\n  there were demonstrable, even palpable, causes for it.\r\n\r\n  I make these observations with the greater freedom, because I have\r\n  once been a witness to what I conceived to have been a most\r\n  unreasonable prejudice, against an innocent institution: I mean, the\r\n  Society of the Cincinnati. I was conscious that my own proceedings on\r\n  that subject were immaculate. I was also convinced, that the\r\n  members,—actuated by motives of sensibility, charity and\r\n  patriotism,—were doing a laudable thing, in erecting that memorial of\r\n  their common services, sufferings and friendships;—and I had not the\r\n  most remote suspicion, that our conduct therein would have been\r\n  unprofitable, or unpleasing to our countrymen. Yet have we been\r\n  virulently traduced, as to our designs: and I have not even escaped\r\n  being represented as short-sighted, in not foreseeing the\r\n  consequences,—or wanting in patriotism, for not discouraging an\r\n  establishment, calculated to create distinctions in society and\r\n  subvert the principles of a republican government. Indeed, the\r\n  _phantom_ seems now to be pretty well laid; except on certain\r\n  occasions,—when it is conjured up, by designing men, to work their own\r\n  purposes upon terrified immaginations:—You will recollect there have\r\n  not been wanting, in the late political discussions, those who were\r\n  hardy enough to assert, that the proposed General Government was the\r\n  wicked and traitorous fabrication of the Cincinnati!\r\n\r\n  At this moment of general agitation and earnest solicitude, I should\r\n  not be surprised to hear a violent outcry raised, by those who are\r\n  hostile to the New Constitution, that the proposition contained in\r\n  your paper had verified their suspicions, and proved the design of\r\n  establishing unjustifiable discriminations. Did I believe that to be\r\n  the case, I should not hesitate to give it my hearty disapprobation.\r\n  But I proceed on other grounds:—Although I make not the clamour of\r\n  credulous, disappointed, or unreasonable men, the criterion of Truth;\r\n  yet, I think, their clamour might have an ungracious influence at the\r\n  present critical juncture: and, in my judgment, some respect should\r\n  not only be paid to prevalent opinions,—but even some sacrifices might\r\n  innocently be made to well meant prejudices, in a popular government.\r\n  Nor could we hope the evil impression would be sufficiently removed,\r\n  should your Account, and Illustrations, be found adequate to produce\r\n  conviction on candid and unprejudiced minds.\r\n\r\n  For myself, I can readily acquit you of having any design of\r\n  facilitating the setting up an “Order of Nobility:”—I do not doubt the\r\n  rectitude of your intentions. But, under the existing circumstances, I\r\n  would willingly decline the honour you have intended me, by your\r\n  polite INSCRIPTION; if there should be any danger of giving serious\r\n  pretext (however ill-founded in reality) for producing or confirming\r\n  jealousy and dissention, in a single instance; when harmony and\r\n  accommodation are most essentially requisite to our public\r\n  prosperity,—perhaps, to our national existence.\r\n\r\n  My remarks, you will please to observe, go only to the expediency, not\r\n  to the merits of the proposition: what may be necessary and proper\r\n  hereafter, I hold myself incompetent to decide; as I am but a private\r\n  citizen. You may, however, rest satisfied, that your composition is\r\n  calculated to give favourable impressions of the science, candour and\r\n  ingenuity, with which you have handled the subject; and that, in all\r\n  personal considerations, I remain with great esteem, Sir, your most\r\n  obedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                        G^O. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n  WM. BARTON, Esq.\r\n\r\n                                  ---\r\n\r\n                          _Dr. Benjamin Rush._\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Memoirs were entirely completed and prepared for the\r\npress, before the decease of this Professor occurred; as is mentioned in\r\nthe preface.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Rush was born in the county of Philadelphia, on the\r\ntwenty-fourth day of December, 1745, O.S. Having graduated in the Arts\r\nat Princeton College, in the autumn of the year 1760, and afterwards\r\nstudied medicine under the direction of the late John Redman, M. D. of\r\nPhiladelphia, he completed his medical education at the University of\r\nEdinburgh; where he received the degree of Doctor in Medicine, in the\r\nspring of 1768. Returning to Philadelphia in the summer of 1769, he was,\r\non the 31st of July, in that year, appointed Professor of Chemistry, in\r\nthe College of Philadelphia; that chair having been supplied for some\r\ntime before, by the late John Morgan, M. D. F. R. S. &c. About twenty\r\nyears after this appointment (viz. in 1789), he succeeded Dr. Morgan in\r\nthe Professorship of the Theory and Practice of Physic, in the same\r\nCollege: and in the year 1791, on the union of that College with the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, he was chosen Professor of the Institutes\r\nand Practice of Physick, &c. in the conjoint institution.\r\n\r\nAt divers times, and on various occasions, his talents were employed in\r\naffairs of political concern. Besides having held, at different periods,\r\nseveral other public stations, he was appointed a member of Congress for\r\nPennsylvania, on the 20th of July, 1776: when he, together with some of\r\nhis colleagues, appointed at the same time, subscribed the Declaration\r\nof American Independence; which great national act had received the\r\nsanction of congress, and been generally signed by the members, sixteen\r\ndays before.\r\n\r\nHe died of a typhus fever, in Philadelphia, on the 19th day of April,\r\n1813; being then advanced a few months beyond the sixty-seventh year of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his decease, Dr. Rush was Professor of the Institutes of\r\nMedicine, of the Theory and Practice of Physic, and of Clinical\r\nMedicine, in the University of Pennsylvania: to which chair, vacated by\r\nhis death, Dr. Benjamin Smith Barton, Professor of Materia Medica,\r\nNatural History and Botany, in the same institution, was elected in the\r\nmonth of July, 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                           Transcriber’s Note\r\n\r\nIn the main sections of the text there are many numbered textual notes,\r\nmany quite lengthy, which the writer chose to keep as close as possible\r\nto their references in the text. In the printed book, this resulted in\r\nmany pages containing only two lines of the main text. The writer\r\nacknowledges this in the Preface, but points out the need to keep the\r\nnotes as close to their references as possible. Many of these notes have\r\nfootnotes of their own, denoted with the traditional *, †, ‡ symbols.\r\n\r\nNotes in the Introduction and Appendix also employ those traditional\r\nsymbols, which have been resequenced for the sake of uniqueness. The\r\nthree notes in the Introduction become I1, I2, I3, and those in the\r\nAppendix become A1, A2, A3, ... An. If a note is itself footnoted, that\r\nnote is indicated as ‘Ana’, etc.\r\n\r\nThe main text employs 386 numeric notes which started with ‘1’ for each\r\nsection. These have been resequenced across the entire text, again for\r\nthe sake of uniqueness. Many notes had footnotes of their own, denoted\r\nwith those traditional symbols. These have have been resequenced as\r\n‘na’, ‘nb’, ‘nc’, etc., where ‘n’ is the note number. Those notes are\r\nplaced following the note.\r\n\r\nAny internal references to the notes, of course, were modified to employ\r\nthe new sequence.\r\n\r\nIn this version, footnotes have been moved to follow the paragraphs in\r\nwhich they are referenced.\r\n\r\nGiven the publication date (1813), spelling remained somewhat fluid. So,\r\nespecially in quoted text, the text mostly remains as printed unless it\r\nis very obviously a typo (e.g. ‘celebratrd’, or ‘inhahitants’), or where\r\nthere is a great preponderance of another variant of a word elsewhere.\r\nThere were two instances of a missing ‘of’ which _may_ have been in\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n  131.31   The making [of] good mathematical instruments  _Sic_\r\n  145.11   on the fourth day [of] July, 1760.             _Sic_\r\n\r\nA quoted translation in note 38 ends abruptly with ‘and spreads her\r\nlight:’ (lvi.29) without a closing quotation mark. This has been amended\r\nas ‘spreads her light[.”]’\r\n\r\nOn two pages (pp. 134, 135), ‘Galileo’ is printed as ‘Gallileo’ (134.33,\r\n134.37 and 135.3), which we take to be a printer’s lapse.\r\n\r\nOn p. 182, The ’Rudolphine’ Tables are misspelled two ways (182.27,\r\n182.29). Both are corrected.\r\n\r\nOn pp. 327-329, the symbol for Uranus (♅) as printed is not quite the\r\nsame as the symbol available to us.
