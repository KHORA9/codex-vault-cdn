I.\r\n\r\nSecond Edition\r\n\r\nReprinted from the PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS of 1831-1838.\r\n\r\nLondon:\r\nRichard and John Edward Taylor,\r\nPrinters and Publishers to the University of London,\r\nRed Lion Court, Fleet Street\r\n\r\n1849\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been induced by various circumstances to collect in One Volume the\r\nFourteen Series of Experimental Researches in Electricity, which have\r\nappeared in the Philosophical Transactions during the last seven years: the\r\nchief reason has been the desire to supply at a moderate price the whole of\r\nthese papers, with an Index, to those who may desire to have them.\r\n\r\nThe readers of the volume will, I hope, do me the justice to remember that\r\nit was not written as a _whole_, but in parts; the earlier portions rarely\r\nhaving any known relation at the time to those which might follow. If I had\r\nrewritten the work, I perhaps might have considerably varied the form, but\r\nshould not have altered much of the real matter: it would not, however,\r\nthen have been considered a faithful reprint or statement of the course and\r\nresults of the whole investigation, which only I desired to supply.\r\n\r\nI may be allowed to express my great satisfaction at finding, that the\r\ndifferent parts, written at intervals during seven years, harmonize so well\r\nas they do. There would have been nothing particular in this, if the parts\r\nhad related only to matters well-ascertained before any of them were\r\nwritten:--but as each professes to contain something of original discovery,\r\nor of correction of received views, it does surprise even my partiality,\r\nthat they should have the degree of consistency and apparent general\r\naccuracy which they seem to me to present.\r\n\r\nI have made some alterations in the text, but they have been altogether of\r\na typographical or grammatical character; and even where greatest, have\r\nbeen intended to explain the sense, not to alter it. I have often added\r\nNotes at the bottom of the page, as to paragraphs 59, 360, 439, 521, 552,\r\n555, 598, 657, 883, for the correction of errors, and also the purpose of\r\nillustration: but these are all distinguished from the Original Notes of\r\nthe Researches by the date of _Dec. 1838_.\r\n\r\nThe date of a scientific paper containing any pretensions to discovery is\r\nfrequently a matter of serious importance, and it is a great misfortune\r\nthat there are many most valuable communications, essential to the history\r\nand progress of science, with respect to which this point cannot now be\r\nascertained. This arises from the circumstance of the papers having no\r\ndates attached to them individually, and of the journals in which they\r\nappear having such as are inaccurate, i.e. dates of a period earlier than\r\nthat of publication. I may refer to the note at the end of the First\r\nSeries, as an illustration of the kind of confusion thus produced. These\r\ncircumstances have induced me to affix a date at the top of every other\r\npage, and I have thought myself justified in using that placed by the\r\nSecretary of the Royal Society on each paper as it was received. An author\r\nhas no right, perhaps, to claim an earlier one, unless it has received\r\nconfirmation by some public act or officer.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding these lines I would beg leave to make a reference or two;\r\nfirst, to my own Papers on Electro-magnetic Rotations in the Quarterly\r\nJournal of Science, 1822. xii. 74. 186. 283. 416, and also to my Letter on\r\nMagneto-electric Induction in the Annales de Chimie, li. p. 404. These\r\nmight, as to the matter, very properly have appeared in this volume, but\r\nthey would have interfered with it as a simple reprint of the \"Experimental\r\nResearches\" of the Philosophical Transactions.\r\n\r\nThen I wish to refer, in relation to the Fourth Series on a new law of\r\nElectric Conduction, to Franklin's experiments on the non-conduction of\r\nice, which have been very properly separated and set forth by Professor\r\nBache (Journal of the Franklin Institute, 1836. xvii. 183.). These, which I\r\ndid not at all remember as to the extent of the effect, though they in no\r\nway anticipate the expression of the law I state as to the general effect\r\nof liquefaction on electrolytes, still should never be forgotten when\r\nspeaking of that law as applicable to the case of water.\r\n\r\nThere are two papers which I am anxious to refer to, as corrections or\r\ncriticisms of parts of the Experimental Researches. The first of these is\r\none by Jacobi (Philosophical Magazine, 1838. xiii. 401.), relative to the\r\npossible production of a spark on completing the junction of the two metals\r\nof a single pair of plates (915.). It is an excellent paper, and though I\r\nhave not repeated the experiments, the description of them convinces me\r\nthat I must have been in error. The second is by that excellent\r\nphilosopher, Marianini (Memoria della Societa Italiana di Modena, xxi.\r\n205), and is a critical and experimental examination of Series viii, and of\r\nthe question whether metallic contact is or is not _productive_ of a part\r\nof the electricity of the voltaic pile. I see no reason as yet to alter the\r\nopinion I have given; but the paper is so very valuable, comes to the\r\nquestion so directly, and the point itself is of such great importance,\r\nthat I intend at the first opportunity renewing the inquiry, and, if I can,\r\nrendering the proofs either on the one side or the other undeniable to all.\r\n\r\nOther parts of these researches have received the honour of critical\r\nattention from various philosophers, to all of whom I am obliged, and some\r\nof whose corrections I have acknowledged in the foot notes. There are, no\r\ndoubt, occasions on which I have not felt the force of the remarks, but\r\ntime and the progress of science will best settle such cases; and, although\r\nI cannot honestly say that I _wish_ to be found in error, yet I do\r\nfervently hope that the progress of science in the hands of its many\r\nzealous present cultivators will be such, as by giving us new and other\r\ndevelopments, and laws more and more general in their applications, will\r\neven make me think that what is written and illustrated in these\r\nexperimental researches, belongs to the by-gone parts of science.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL FARADAY.\r\n\r\nRoyal Institution,\r\nMarch, 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                                                       Par.\r\nSeries I.    §. 1.

The power which electricity of tension possesses of causing an opposite\r\nelectrical state in its vicinity has been expressed by the general term\r\nInduction; which, as it has been received into scientific language, may\r\nalso, with propriety, be used in the same general sense to express the\r\npower which electrical currents may possess of inducing any particular\r\nstate upon matter in their immediate neighbourhood, otherwise indifferent.\r\nIt is with this meaning that I purpose using it in the present paper.\r\n\r\n2. Certain effects of the induction of electrical currents have already\r\nbeen recognised and described: as those of magnetization; Ampère's\r\nexperiments of bringing a copper disc near to a flat spiral; his repetition\r\nwith electro-magnets of Arago's extraordinary experiments, and perhaps a\r\nfew others. Still it appeared unlikely that these could be all the effects\r\nwhich induction by currents could produce; especially as, upon dispensing\r\nwith iron, almost the whole of them disappear, whilst yet an infinity of\r\nbodies, exhibiting definite phenomena of induction with electricity of\r\ntension, still remain to be acted upon by the induction of electricity in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n3. Further: Whether Ampère's beautiful theory were adopted, or any other,\r\nor whatever reservation were mentally made, still it appeared very\r\nextraordinary, that as every electric current was accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding intensity of magnetic action at right angles to the current,\r\ngood conductors of electricity, when placed within the sphere of this\r\naction, should not have any current induced through them, or some sensible\r\neffect produced equivalent in force to such a current.\r\n\r\n4. These considerations, with their consequence, the hope of obtaining\r\nelectricity from ordinary magnetism, have stimulated me at various times to\r\ninvestigate experimentally the inductive effect of electric currents. I\r\nlately arrived at positive results; and not only had my hopes fulfilled,\r\nbut obtained a key which appeared to me to open out a full explanation of\r\nArago's magnetic phenomena, and also to discover a new state, which may\r\nprobably have great influence in some of the most important effects of\r\nelectric currents.\r\n\r\n5. These results I purpose describing, not as they were obtained, but in\r\nsuch a manner as to give the most concise view of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _Induction of Electric Currents._\r\n\r\n\r\n6. About twenty-six feet of copper wire one twentieth of an inch in\r\ndiameter were wound round a cylinder of wood as a helix, the different\r\nspires of which were prevented from touching by a thin interposed twine.\r\nThis helix was covered with calico, and then a second wire applied in the\r\nsame manner. In this way twelve helices were superposed, each containing an\r\naverage length of wire of twenty-seven feet, and all in the same direction.\r\nThe first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh of these helices were\r\nconnected at their extremities end to end, so as to form one helix; the\r\nothers were connected in a similar manner; and thus two principal helices\r\nwere produced, closely interposed, having the same direction, not touching\r\nanywhere, and each containing one hundred and fifty-five feet in length of\r\nwire.\r\n\r\n7. One of these helices was connected with a galvanometer, the other with a\r\nvoltaic battery of ten pairs of plates four inches square, with double\r\ncoppers and well charged; yet not the slightest sensible reflection of the\r\ngalvanometer-needle could be observed.\r\n\r\n8. A similar compound helix, consisting of six lengths of copper and six of\r\nsoft iron wire, was constructed. The resulting iron helix contained two\r\nhundred and fourteen feet of wire, the resulting copper helix two hundred\r\nand eight feet; but whether the current from the trough was passed through\r\nthe copper or the iron helix, no effect upon the other could be perceived\r\nat the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n9. In these and many similar experiments no difference in action of any\r\nkind appeared between iron and other metals.\r\n\r\n10. Two hundred and three feet of copper wire in one length were coiled\r\nround a large block of wood; other two hundred and three feet of similar\r\nwire were interposed as a spiral between the turns of the first coil, and\r\nmetallic contact everywhere prevented by twine. One of these helices was\r\nconnected with a galvanometer, and the other with a battery of one hundred\r\npairs of plates four inches square, with double coppers, and well charged.\r\nWhen the contact was made, there was a sudden and very slight effect at the\r\ngalvanometer, and there was also a similar slight effect when the contact\r\nwith the battery was broken. But whilst the voltaic current was continuing\r\nto pass through the one helix, no galvanometrical appearances nor any\r\neffect like induction upon the other helix could be perceived, although the\r\nactive power of the battery was proved to be great, by its heating the\r\nwhole of its own helix, and by the brilliancy of the discharge when made\r\nthrough charcoal.\r\n\r\n11. Repetition of the experiments with a battery of one hundred and twenty\r\npairs of plates produced no other effects; but it was ascertained, both at\r\nthis and the former time, that the slight deflection of the needle\r\noccurring at the moment of completing the connexion, was always in one\r\ndirection, and that the equally slight deflection produced when the contact\r\nwas broken, was in the other direction; and also, that these effects\r\noccurred when the first helices were used (6. 8.).\r\n\r\n12. The results which I had by this time obtained with magnets led me to\r\nbelieve that the battery current through one wire, did, in reality, induce\r\na similar current through the other wire, but that it continued for an\r\ninstant only, and partook more of the nature of the electrical wave passed\r\nthrough from the shock of a common Leyden jar than of the current from a\r\nvoltaic battery, and therefore might magnetise a steel needle, although it\r\nscarcely affected the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n13. This expectation was confirmed; for on substituting a small hollow\r\nhelix, formed round a glass tube, for the galvanometer, introducing a steel\r\nneedle, making contact as before between the battery and the inducing wire\r\n(7. 10.), and then removing the needle before the battery contact was\r\nbroken, it was found magnetised.\r\n\r\n14. When the battery contact was first made, then an unmagnetised needle\r\nintroduced into the small indicating helix (13.), and lastly the battery\r\ncontact broken, the needle was found magnetised to an equal degree\r\napparently as before; but the poles were of the contrary kind.\r\n\r\n15. The same effects took place on using the large compound helices first\r\ndescribed (6. 8.).\r\n\r\n16. When the unmagnetised needle was put into the indicating helix, before\r\ncontact of the inducing wire with the battery, and remained there until the\r\ncontact was broken, it exhibited little or no magnetism; the first effect\r\nhaving been nearly neutralised by the second (13. 14.). The force of the\r\ninduced current upon making contact was found always to exceed that of the\r\ninduced current at breaking of contact; and if therefore the contact was\r\nmade and broken many times in succession, whilst the needle remained in the\r\nindicating helix, it at last came out not unmagnetised, but a needle\r\nmagnetised as if the induced current upon making contact had acted alone on\r\nit. This effect may be due to the accumulation (as it is called) at the\r\npoles of the unconnected pile, rendering the current upon first making\r\ncontact more powerful than what it is afterwards, at the moment of breaking\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n17. If the circuit between the helix or wire under induction and the\r\ngalvanometer or indicating spiral was not rendered complete _before_ the\r\nconnexion between the battery and the inducing wire was completed or\r\nbroken, then no effects were perceived at the galvanometer. Thus, if the\r\nbattery communications were first made, and then the wire under induction\r\nconnected with the indicating helix, no magnetising power was there\r\nexhibited. But still retaining the latter communications, when those with\r\nthe battery were broken, a magnet was formed in the helix, but of the\r\nsecond kind (14.), i.e. with poles indicating a current in the same\r\ndirection to that belonging to the battery current, or to that always\r\ninduced by that current at its cessation.\r\n\r\n18. In the preceding experiments the wires were placed near to each other,\r\nand the contact of the inducing one with the buttery made when the\r\ninductive effect was required; but as the particular action might be\r\nsupposed to be exerted only at the moments of making and breaking contact,\r\nthe induction was produced in another way. Several feet of copper wire were\r\nstretched in wide zigzag forms, representing the letter W, on one surface\r\nof a broad board; a second wire was stretched in precisely similar forms on\r\na second board, so that when brought near the first, the wires should\r\neverywhere touch, except that a sheet of thick paper was interposed. One of\r\nthese wires was connected with the galvanometer, and the other with a\r\nvoltaic battery. The first wire was then moved towards the second, and as\r\nit approached, the needle was deflected. Being then removed, the needle was\r\ndeflected in the opposite direction. By first making the wires approach and\r\nthen recede, simultaneously with the vibrations of the needle, the latter\r\nsoon became very extensive; but when the wires ceased to move from or\r\ntowards each other, the galvanometer-needle soon came to its usual\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n19. As the wires approximated, the induced current was in the _contrary_\r\ndirection to the inducing current. As the wires receded, the induced\r\ncurrent was in the _same_ direction as the inducing current. When the wires\r\nremained stationary, there was no induced current (54.).\r\n\r\n20. When a small voltaic arrangement was introduced into the circuit\r\nbetween the galvanometer (10.) and its helix or wire, so as to cause a\r\npermanent deflection of 30° or 40°, and then the battery of one hundred\r\npairs of plates connected with the inducing wire, there was an\r\ninstantaneous action as before (11.); but the galvanometer-needle\r\nimmediately resumed and retained its place unaltered, notwithstanding the\r\ncontinued contact of the inducing wire with the trough: such was the case\r\nin whichever way the contacts were made (33.).\r\n\r\n21. Hence it would appear that collateral currents, either in the same or\r\nin opposite directions, exert no permanent inducing power on each other,\r\naffecting their quantity or tension.\r\n\r\n22. I could obtain no evidence by the tongue, by spark, or by heating fine\r\nwire or charcoal, of the electricity passing through the wire under\r\ninduction; neither could I obtain any chemical effects, though the contacts\r\nwith metallic and other solutions were made and broken alternately with\r\nthose of the battery, so that the second effect of induction should not\r\noppose or neutralise the first (13. 16.).\r\n\r\n23. This deficiency of effect is not because the induced current of\r\nelectricity cannot pass fluids, but probably because of its brief duration\r\nand feeble intensity; for on introducing two large copper plates into the\r\ncircuit on the induced side (20.), the plates being immersed in brine, but\r\nprevented from touching each other by an interposed cloth, the effect at\r\nthe indicating galvanometer, or helix, occurred as before. The induced\r\nelectricity could also pass through a voltaic trough (20.). When, however,\r\nthe quantity of interposed fluid was reduced to a drop, the galvanometer\r\ngave no indication.\r\n\r\n24. Attempts to obtain similar effects by the use of wires conveying\r\nordinary electricity were doubtful in the results. A compound helix similar\r\nto that already described, containing eight elementary helices (6.), was\r\nused. Four of the helices had their similar ends bound together by wire,\r\nand the two general terminations thus produced connected with the small\r\nmagnetising helix containing an unmagnetised needle (13.). The other four\r\nhelices were similarly arranged, but their ends connected with a Leyden\r\njar. On passing the discharge, the needle was found to be a magnet; but it\r\nappeared probable that a part of the electricity of the jar had passed off\r\nto the small helix, and so magnetised the needle. There was indeed no\r\nreason to expect that the electricity of a jar possessing as it does great\r\ntension, would not diffuse itself through all the metallic matter\r\ninterposed between the coatings.\r\n\r\n25. Still it does not follow that the discharge of ordinary electricity\r\nthrough a wire does not produce analogous phenomena to those arising from\r\nvoltaic electricity; but as it appears impossible to separate the effects\r\nproduced at the moment when the discharge begins to pass, from the equal\r\nand contrary effects produced when it ceases to pass (16.), inasmuch as\r\nwith ordinary electricity these periods are simultaneous, so there can be\r\nscarcely any hope that in this form of the experiment they can be\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\n26. Hence it is evident that currents of voltaic electricity present\r\nphenomena of induction somewhat analogous to those produced by electricity\r\nof tension, although, as will be seen hereafter, many differences exist\r\nbetween them. The result is the production of other currents, (but which\r\nare only momentary,) parallel, or tending to parallelism, with the inducing\r\ncurrent. By reference to the poles of the needle formed in the indicating\r\nhelix (13. 14.) and to the deflections of the galvanometer-needle (11.), it\r\nwas found in all cases that the induced current, produced by the first\r\naction of the inducing current, was in the contrary direction to the\r\nlatter, but that the current produced by the cessation of the inducing\r\ncurrent was in the same direction (19.). For the purpose of avoiding\r\nperiphrasis, I propose to call this action of the current from the voltaic\r\nbattery, _volta-electric induction_. The properties of the second wire,\r\nafter induction has developed the first current, and whilst the electricity\r\nfrom the battery continues to flow through its inducing neighbour (10.\r\n18.), constitute a peculiar electric condition, the consideration of which\r\nwill be resumed hereafter (60.). All these results have been obtained with\r\na voltaic apparatus consisting of a single pair of plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Evolution of Electricity from Magnetism._\r\n\r\n\r\n27. A welded ring was made of soft round bar-iron, the metal being\r\nseven-eighths of an inch in thickness, and the ring six inches in external\r\ndiameter. Three helices were put round one part of this ring, each\r\ncontaining about twenty-four feet of copper wire one twentieth of an inch\r\nthick; they were insulated from the iron and each other, and superposed in\r\nthe manner before described (6.), occupying about nine inches in length\r\nupon the ring. They could be used separately or conjointly; the group may\r\nbe distinguished by the letter A (Pl. I. fig. 1.). On the other part of the\r\nring about sixty feet of similar copper wire in two pieces were applied in\r\nthe same manner, forming a helix B, which had the same common direction\r\nwith the helices of A, but being separated from it at each extremity by\r\nabout half an inch of the uncovered iron.\r\n\r\n28. The helix B was connected by copper wires with a galvanometer three\r\nfeet from the ring. The helices of A were connected end to end so as to\r\nform one common helix, the extremities of which were connected with a\r\nbattery of ten pairs of plates four inches square. The galvanometer was\r\nimmediately affected, and to a degree far beyond what has been described\r\nwhen with a battery of tenfold power helices _without iron_ were used\r\n(10.); but though the contact was continued, the effect was not permanent,\r\nfor the needle soon came to rest in its natural position, as if quite\r\nindifferent to the attached electro-magnetic arrangement. Upon breaking the\r\ncontact with the batterry, the needle was again powerfully deflected, but\r\nin the contrary direction to that induced in the first instance.\r\n\r\n29. Upon arranging the apparatus so that B should be out of use, the\r\ngalvanometer be connected with one of the three wires of A (27.), and the\r\nother two made into a helix through which the current from the trough (28.)\r\nwas passed, similar but rather more powerful effects were produced.\r\n\r\n30. When the battery contact was made in one direction, the\r\ngalvanometer-needle was deflected on the one side; if made in the other\r\ndirection, the deflection was on the other side. The deflection on breaking\r\nthe battery contact was always the reverse of that produced by completing\r\nit. The deflection on making a battery contact always indicated an induced\r\ncurrent in the opposite direction to that from the battery; but on breaking\r\nthe contact the deflection indicated an induced current in the same\r\ndirection as that of the battery. No making or breaking of the contact at B\r\nside, or in any part of the galvanometer circuit, produced any effect at\r\nthe galvanometer. No continuance of the battery current caused any\r\ndeflection of the galvanometer-needle. As the above results are common to\r\nall these experiments, and to similar ones with ordinary magnets to be\r\nhereafter detailed, they need not be again particularly described.\r\n\r\n31. Upon using the power of one hundred pairs of plates (10.) with this\r\nring, the impulse at the galvanometer, when contact was completed or\r\nbroken, was so great as to make the needle spin round rapidly four or five\r\ntimes, before the air and terrestrial magnetism could reduce its motion to\r\nmere oscillation.\r\n\r\n32. By using charcoal at the ends of the B helix, a minute _spark_ could be\r\nperceived when the contact of the battery with A was completed. This spark\r\ncould not be due to any diversion of a part of the current of the battery\r\nthrough the iron to the helix B; for when the battery contact was\r\ncontinued, the galvanometer still resumed its perfectly indifferent state\r\n(28.). The spark was rarely seen on breaking contact. A small platina wire\r\ncould not be ignited by this induced current; but there seems every reason\r\nto believe that the effect would be obtained by using a stronger original\r\ncurrent or a more powerful arrangement of helices.\r\n\r\n33. A feeble voltaic current was sent through the helix B and the\r\ngalvanometer, so as to deflect the needle of the latter 30° or 40°, and\r\nthen the battery of one hundred pairs of plates connected with A; but after\r\nthe first effect was over, the galvanometer-needle resumed exactly the\r\nposition due to the feeble current transmitted by its own wire. This took\r\nplace in whichever way the battery contacts were made, and shows that here\r\nagain (20.) no permanent influence of the currents upon each other, as to\r\ntheir quantity and tension, exists.\r\n\r\n34. Another arrangement was then employed connecting the former experiments\r\non volta-electric induction (6-26.) with the present. A combination of\r\nhelices like that already described (6.) was constructed upon a hollow\r\ncylinder of pasteboard: there were eight lengths of copper wire, containing\r\naltogether 220 feet; four of these helices were connected end to end, and\r\nthen with the galvanometer (7.); the other intervening four were also\r\nconnected end to end, and the battery of one hundred pairs discharged\r\nthrough them. In this form the effect on the galvanometer was hardly\r\nsensible (11.), though magnets could be made by the induced current (13.).\r\nBut when a soft iron cylinder seven eighths of an inch thick, and twelve\r\ninches long, was introduced into the pasteboard tube, surrounded by the\r\nhelices, then the induced current affected the galvanometer powerfully and\r\nwith all the phenomena just described (30.). It possessed also the power of\r\nmaking magnets with more energy, apparently, than when no iron cylinder was\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n35. When the iron cylinder was replaced by an equal cylinder of copper, no\r\neffect beyond that of the helices alone was produced. The iron cylinder\r\narrangement was not so powerful as the ring arrangement already described\r\n(27.).\r\n\r\n36. Similar effects were then produced by _ordinary magnets_: thus the\r\nhollow helix just described (34.) had all its elementary helices connected\r\nwith the galvanometer by two copper wires, each five feet in length; the\r\nsoft iron cylinder was introduced into its axis; a couple of bar magnets,\r\neach twenty-four inches long, were arranged with their opposite poles at\r\none end in contact, so as to resemble a horse-shoe magnet, and then contact\r\nmade between the other poles and the ends of the iron cylinder, so as to\r\nconvert it for the time into a magnet (fig. 2.): by breaking the magnetic\r\ncontacts, or reversing them, the magnetism of the iron cylinder could be\r\ndestroyed or reversed at pleasure.\r\n\r\n37. Upon making magnetic contact, the needle was deflected; continuing the\r\ncontact, the needle became indifferent, and resumed its first position; on\r\nbreaking the contact, it was again deflected, but in the opposite direction\r\nto the first effect, and then it again became indifferent. When the\r\nmagnetic contacts were reversed the deflections were reversed.\r\n\r\n38. When the magnetic contact was made, the deflection was such as to\r\nindicate an induced current of electricity in the opposite direction to\r\nthat fitted to form a magnet, having the same polarity as that really\r\nproduced by contact with the bar magnets. Thus when the marked and unmarked\r\npoles were placed as in fig. 3, the current in the helix was in the\r\ndirection represented, P being supposed to be the end of the wire going to\r\nthe positive pole of the battery, or that end towards which the zinc plates\r\nface, and N the negative wire. Such a current would have converted the\r\ncylinder into a magnet of the opposite kind to that formed by contact with\r\nthe poles A and B; and such a current moves in the opposite direction to\r\nthe currents which in M. Ampère's beautiful theory are considered as\r\nconstituting a magnet in the position figured[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] The relative position of an electric current and a magnet is by\r\n  most persons found very difficult to remember, and three or four helps\r\n  to the memory have been devised by M. Ampère and others. I venture to\r\n  suggest the following as a very simple and effectual assistance in\r\n  these and similar latitudes. Let the experimenter think he is looking\r\n  down upon a dipping needle, or upon the pole of the north, and then\r\n  let him think upon the direction of the motion of the hands of a\r\n  watch, or of a screw moving direct; currents in that direction round a\r\n  needle would make it into such a magnet as the dipping needle, or\r\n  would themselves constitute an electro-magnet of similar qualities; or\r\n  if brought near a magnet would tend to make it take that direction; or\r\n  would themselves be moved into that position by a magnet so placed; or\r\n  in M. Ampère's theory are considered as moving in that direction in\r\n  the magnet. These two points of the position of the dipping-needle and\r\n  the motion of the watch hands being remembered, any other relation of\r\n  the current and magnet can be at once deduced from it.\r\n\r\n39. But as it might be supposed that in all the preceding experiments of\r\nthis section, it was by some peculiar effect taking place during the\r\nformation of the magnet, and not by its mere virtual approximation, that\r\nthe momentary induced current was excited, the following experiment was\r\nmade. All the similar ends of the compound hollow helix (34.) were bound\r\ntogether by copper wire, forming two general terminations, and these were\r\nconnected with the galvanometer. The soft iron cylinder (34.) was removed,\r\nand a cylindrical magnet, three quarters of an inch in diameter and eight\r\ninches and a half in length, used instead. One end of this magnet was\r\nintroduced into the axis of the helix (fig. 4.), and then, the\r\ngalvanometer-needle being stationary, the magnet was suddenly thrust in;\r\nimmediately the needle was deflected in the same direction as if the magnet\r\nhad been formed by either of the two preceding processes (34. 36.). Being\r\nleft in, the needle resumed its first position, and then the magnet being\r\nwithdrawn the needle was deflected in the opposite direction. These effects\r\nwere not great; but by introducing and withdrawing the magnet, so that the\r\nimpulse each time should be added to those previously communicated to the\r\nneedle, the latter could be made to vibrate through an arc of 180° or more.\r\n\r\n40. In this experiment the magnet must not be passed entirely through the\r\nhelix, for then a second action occurs. When the magnet is introduced, the\r\nneedle at the galvanometer is deflected in a certain direction; but being\r\nin, whether it be pushed quite through or withdrawn, the needle is\r\ndeflected in a direction the reverse of that previously produced. When the\r\nmagnet is passed in and through at one continuous motion, the needle moves\r\none way, is then suddenly stopped, and finally moves the other way.\r\n\r\n41. If such a hollow helix as that described (34.) be laid east and west\r\n(or in any other constant position), and a magnet be retained east and\r\nwest, its marked pole always being one way; then whichever end of the helix\r\nthe magnet goes in at, and consequently whichever pole of the magnet enters\r\nfirst, still the needle is deflected the same way: on the other hand,\r\nwhichever direction is followed in withdrawing the magnet, the deflection\r\nis constant, but contrary to that due to its entrance.\r\n\r\n42. These effects are simple consequences of the _law_ hereafter to be\r\ndescribed (114).\r\n\r\n43. When the eight elementary helices were made one long helix, the effect\r\nwas not so great as in the arrangement described. When only one of the\r\neight helices was used, the effect was also much diminished. All care was\r\ntaken to guard against tiny direct action of the inducing magnet upon the\r\ngalvanometer, and it was found that by moving the magnet in the same\r\ndirection, and to the same degree on the outside of the helix, no effect on\r\nthe needle was produced.\r\n\r\n44. The Royal Society are in possession of a large compound magnet formerly\r\nbelonging to Dr. Gowin Knight, which, by permission of the President and\r\nCouncil, I was allowed to use in the prosecution of these experiments: it\r\nis at present in the charge of Mr. Christie, at his house at Woolwich,\r\nwhere, by Mr. Christie's kindness, I was at liberty to work; and I have to\r\nacknowledge my obligations to him for his assistance in all the experiments\r\nand observations made with it. This magnet is composed of about 450 bar\r\nmagnets, each fifteen inches long, one inch wide, and half an inch thick,\r\narranged in a box so as to present at one of its extremities two external\r\npoles (fig. 5.). These poles projected horizontally six inches from the\r\nbox, were each twelve inches high and three inches wide. They were nine\r\ninches apart; and when a soft iron cylinder, three quarters of an inch in\r\ndiameter and twelve inches long, was put across from one to the other, it\r\nrequired a force of nearly one hundred pounds to break the contact. The\r\npole to the left in the figure is the marked pole[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] To avoid any confusion as to the poles of the magnet, I shall\r\n  designate the pole pointing to the north as the marked pole; I may\r\n  occasionally speak of the north and south ends of the needle, but do\r\n  not mean thereby north and south poles. That is by many considered the\r\n  true north pole of a needle which points to the south; but in this\r\n  country it in often called the south pole.\r\n\r\n45. The indicating galvanometer, in all experiments made with this magnet,\r\nwas about eight feet from it, not directly in front of the poles, but about\r\n16° or 17° on one side. It was found that on making or breaking the\r\nconnexion of the poles by soft iron, the instrument was slightly affected;\r\nbut all error of observation arising from this cause was easily and\r\ncarefully avoided.\r\n\r\n46. The electrical effects exhibited by this magnet were very striking.\r\nWhen a soft iron cylinder thirteen inches long was put through the compound\r\nhollow helix, with its ends arranged as two general terminations (39.),\r\nthese connected with the galvanometer, and the iron cylinder brought in\r\ncontact with the two poles of the magnet (fig. 5.), so powerful a rush of\r\nelectricity took place that the needle whirled round many times in\r\nsuccession[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] A soft iron bar in the form of a lifter to a horse-shoe magnet,\r\n  when supplied with a coil of this kind round the middle of it,\r\n  becomes, by juxta-position with a magnet, a ready source of a brief\r\n  but determinate current of electricity.\r\n\r\n47. Notwithstanding this great power, if the contact was continued, the\r\nneedle resumed its natural position, being entirely uninfluenced by the\r\nposition of the helix (30.). But on breaking the magnetic contact, the\r\nneedle was whirled round in the opposite direction with a force equal to\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\n48. A piece of copper plate wrapped _once_ round the iron cylinder like a\r\nsocket, but with interposed paper to prevent contact, had its edges\r\nconnected with the wires of the galvanometer. When the iron was brought in\r\ncontact with the poles the galvanometer was strongly affected.\r\n\r\n49. Dismissing the helices and sockets, the galvanometer wire was passed\r\nover, and consequently only half round the iron cylinder (fig. 6.); but\r\neven then a strong effect upon the needle was exhibited, when the magnetic\r\ncontact was made or broken.\r\n\r\n50. As the helix with its iron cylinder was brought towards the magnetic\r\npoles, but _without making contact_, still powerful effects were produced.\r\nWhen the helix, without the iron cylinder, and consequently containing no\r\nmetal but copper, was approached to, or placed between the poles (44.), the\r\nneedle was thrown 80°, 90°, or more, from its natural position. The\r\ninductive force was of course greater, the nearer the helix, either with or\r\nwithout its iron cylinder, was brought to the poles; but otherwise the same\r\neffects were produced, whether the helix, &c. was or was not brought into\r\ncontact with the magnet; i.e. no permanent effect on the galvanometer was\r\nproduced; and the effects of approximation and removal were the reverse of\r\neach other (30.).\r\n\r\n51. When a bolt of copper corresponding to the iron cylinder was\r\nintroduced, no greater effect was produced by the helix than without it.\r\nBut when a thick iron wire was substituted, the magneto-electric induction\r\nwas rendered sensibly greater.\r\n\r\n52. The direction of the electric current produced in all these experiments\r\nwith the helix, was the same as that already described (38.) as obtained\r\nwith the weaker bar magnets.\r\n\r\n53. A spiral containing fourteen feet of copper wire, being connected with\r\nthe galvanometer, and approximated directly towards the marked pole in the\r\nline of its axis, affected the instrument strongly; the current induced in\r\nit was in the reverse direction to the current theoretically considered by\r\nM. Ampère as existing in the magnet (38.), or as the current in an\r\nelectro-magnet of similar polarity. As the spiral was withdrawn, the\r\ninduced current was reversed.\r\n\r\n54. A similar spiral had the current of eighty pairs of 4-inch plates sent\r\nthrough it so as to form an electro-magnet, and then the other spiral\r\nconnected with the galvanometer (58.) approximated to it; the needle\r\nvibrated, indicating a current in the galvanometer spiral the reverse of\r\nthat in the battery spiral (18. 26.). On withdrawing the latter spiral, the\r\nneedle passed in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n55. Single wires, approximated in certain directions towards the magnetic\r\npole, had currents induced in them. On their removal, the currents were\r\ninverted. In such experiments the wires should not be removed in directions\r\ndifferent to those in which they were approximated; for then occasionally\r\ncomplicated and irregular effects are produced, the causes of which will be\r\nvery evident in the fourth part of this paper.\r\n\r\n56. All attempts to obtain chemical effects by the induced current of\r\nelectricity failed, though the precautions before described (22.), and all\r\nothers that could be thought of, were employed. Neither was any sensation\r\non the tongue, or any convulsive effect upon the limbs of a frog, produced.\r\nNor could charcoal or fine wire be ignited (133.). But upon repeating the\r\nexperiments more at leisure at the Royal Institution, with an armed\r\nloadstone belonging to Professor Daniell and capable of lifting about\r\nthirty pounds, a frog was very _powerfully convulsed_ each time magnetic\r\ncontact was made. At first the convulsions could not be obtained on\r\nbreaking magnetic contact; but conceiving the deficiency of effect was\r\nbecause of the comparative slowness of separation, the latter act was\r\neffected by a blow, and then the frog was convulsed strongly. The more\r\ninstantaneous the union or disunion is effected, the more powerful the\r\nconvulsion. I thought also I could perceive the _sensation_ upon the tongue\r\nand the _flash_ before the eyes; but I could obtain no evidence of chemical\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\n57. The various experiments of this section prove, I think, most completely\r\nthe production of electricity from ordinary magnetism. That its intensity\r\nshould be very feeble and quantity small, cannot be considered wonderful,\r\nwhen it is remembered that like thermo-electricity it is evolved entirely\r\nwithin the substance of metals retaining all their conducting power. But an\r\nagent which is conducted along metallic wires in the manner described;\r\nwhich whilst so passing possesses the peculiar magnetic actions and force\r\nof a current of electricity; which can agitate and convulse the limbs of a\r\nfrog; and which, finally, can produce a spark[A] by its discharge through\r\ncharcoal (32.), can only be electricity. As all the effects can be produced\r\nby ferruginous electro-magnets (34.), there is no doubt that arrangements\r\nlike the magnets of Professors Moll, Henry, Ten Eyke, and others, in which\r\nas many as two thousand pounds have been lifted, may be used for these\r\nexperiments; in which case not only a brighter spark may be obtained, but\r\nwires also ignited, and, as the current can pass liquids (23.), chemical\r\naction be produced. These effects are still more likely to be obtained when\r\nthe magneto-electric arrangements to be explained in the fourth section are\r\nexcited by the powers of such apparatus.\r\n\r\n  [A] For a mode of obtaining the spark from the common magnet which I\r\n  have found effectual, see the Philosophical Magazine for June 1832, p.\r\n  5. In the same Journal for November 1834, vol. v. p. 349, will be\r\n  found a method of obtaining the magneto-electric spark, still simpler\r\n  in its principle, the use of soft iron being dispensed with\r\n  altogether.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n58. The similarity of action, almost amounting to identity, between common\r\nmagnets and either electro-magnets or volta-electric currents, is\r\nstrikingly in accordance with and confirmatory of M. Ampère's theory, and\r\nfurnishes powerful reasons for believing that the action is the same in\r\nboth cases; but, as a distinction in language is still necessary, I propose\r\nto call the agency thus exerted by ordinary magnets, _magneto-electric_ or\r\n_magnelectric_ induction (26).\r\n\r\n59. The only difference which powerfully strikes the attention as existing\r\nbetween volta-electric and magneto-electric induction, is the suddenness of\r\nthe former, and the sensible time required by the latter; but even in this\r\nearly state of investigation there are circumstances which seem to\r\nindicate, that upon further inquiry this difference will, as a\r\nphilosophical distinction, disappear (68).[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] For important additional phenomena and developments of the\r\n  induction of electrical currents, see now the ninth series,\r\n  1048-1118.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _New Electrical State or Condition of Matter._[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] This section having been read at the Royal Society and reported\r\n  upon, and having also, in consequence of a letter from myself to M.\r\n  Hachette, been noticed at the French Institute, I feel bound to let it\r\n  stand as part of the paper; but later investigations (intimated 73.\r\n  76. 77.) of the laws governing those phenomena, induce me to think\r\n  that the latter can be fully explained without admitting the\r\n  electro-tonic state. My views on this point will appear in the second\r\n  series of these researches.--M.F.\r\n\r\n\r\n60. Whilst the wire is subject to either volta-electric or magneto-electric\r\ninduction, it appears to be in a peculiar state; for it resists the\r\nformation of an electrical current in it, whereas, if in its common\r\ncondition, such a current would be produced; and when left uninfluenced it\r\nhas the power of originating a current, a power which the wire does not\r\npossess under common circumstances. This electrical condition of matter has\r\nnot hitherto been recognised, but it probably exerts a very important\r\ninfluence in many if not most of the phenomena produced by currents of\r\nelectricity. For reasons which will immediately appear (71.), I have, after\r\nadvising with several learned friends, ventured to designate it as the\r\n_electro-ionic_ state.\r\n\r\n61. This peculiar condition shows no known electrical effects whilst it\r\ncontinues; nor have I yet been able to discover any peculiar powers\r\nexerted, or properties possessed, by matter whilst retained in this state.\r\n\r\n62. It shows no reaction by attractive or repulsive powers. The various\r\nexperiments which have been made with powerful magnets upon such metals, as\r\ncopper, silver, and generally those substances not magnetic, prove this\r\npoint; for the substances experimented upon, if electrical conductors, must\r\nhave acquired this state; and yet no evidence of attractive or repulsive\r\npowers has been observed. I have placed copper and silver discs, very\r\ndelicately suspended on torsion balances in vacuo near to the poles of very\r\npowerful magnets, yet have not been able to observe the least attractive or\r\nrepulsive force.\r\n\r\n63. I have also arranged a fine slip of gold-leaf very near to a bar of\r\ncopper, the two being in metallic contact by mercury at their extremities.\r\nThese have been placed in vacuo, so that metal rods connected with the\r\nextremities of the arrangement should pass through the sides of the vessel\r\ninto the air. I have then moved powerful magnetic poles, about this\r\narrangement, in various directions, the metallic circuit on the outside\r\nbeing sometimes completed by wires, and sometimes broken. But I never could\r\nobtain any sensible motion of the gold-leaf, either directed to the magnet\r\nor towards the collateral bar of copper, which must have been, as far as\r\ninduction was concerned, in a similar state to itself.\r\n\r\n64. In some cases it has been supposed that, under such circumstances,\r\nattractive and repulsive forces have been exhibited, i.e. that such bodies\r\nhave become slightly magnetic. But the phenomena now described, in\r\nconjunction with the confidence we may reasonably repose in M. Ampère's\r\ntheory of magnetism, tend to throw doubt on such cases; for if magnetism\r\ndepend upon the attraction of electrical currents, and if the powerful\r\ncurrents at first excited, both by volta-electric and magneto-electric\r\ninduction, instantly and naturally cease (12. 28. 47.), causing at the same\r\ntime an entire cessation of magnetic effects at the galvanometer needle,\r\nthen there can be little or no expectation that any substances not\r\npartaking of the peculiar relation in which iron, nickel, and one or two\r\nother bodies, stand, should exhibit magneto-attractive powers. It seems far\r\nmore probable, that the extremely feeble permanent effects observed have\r\nbeen due to traces of iron, or perhaps some other unrecognised cause not\r\nmagnetic.\r\n\r\n65. This peculiar condition exerts no retarding or accelerating power upon\r\nelectrical currents passing through metal thus circumstanced (20. 33.).\r\nNeither could any such power upon the inducing current itself be detected;\r\nfor when masses of metal, wires, helices, &c. were arranged in all possible\r\nways by the side of a wire or helix, carrying a current measured by the\r\ngalvanometer (20.), not the slightest permanent change in the indication of\r\nthe instrument could be perceived. Metal in the supposed peculiar state,\r\ntherefore, conducts electricity in all directions with its ordinary\r\nfacility, or, in other words, its conducting power is not sensibly altered\r\nby it.\r\n\r\n66. All metals take on the peculiar state. This is proved in the preceding\r\nexperiments with copper and iron (9.), and with gold, silver, tin, lead,\r\nzinc, antimony, bismuth, mercury, &c. by experiments to be described in the\r\nfourth part (132.), admitting of easy application. With regard to iron, the\r\nexperiments prove the thorough and remarkable independence of these\r\nphenomena of induction, and the ordinary magnetical appearances of that\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n67. This state is altogether the effect of the induction exerted, and\r\nceases as soon as the inductive force is removed. It is the same state,\r\nwhether produced by the collateral passage of voltaic currents (26.), or\r\nthe formation of a magnet (34. 36.), or the mere approximation of a magnet\r\n(39. 50.); and is a strong proof in addition to those advanced by M.\r\nAmpère, of the identity of the agents concerned in these several\r\noperations. It probably occurs, momentarily, during the passage of the\r\ncommon electric spark (24.), and may perhaps be obtained hereafter in bad\r\nconductors by weak electrical currents or other means (74. 76).\r\n\r\n68. The state appears to be instantly assumed (12.), requiring hardly a\r\nsensible portion of time for that purpose. The _difference_ of time between\r\nvolta-electric and magneto-electric induction, rendered evident by the\r\ngalvanometer (59.), may probably be thus explained. When a voltaic current\r\nis sent through one of two parallel wires, as those of the hollow helix\r\n(34.), a current is produced in the other wire, as brief in its continuance\r\nas the time required for a single action of this kind, and which, by\r\nexperiment, is found to be inappreciably small. The action will seem still\r\nmore instantaneous, because, as there is an accumulation of power in the\r\npoles of the battery before contact, the first rush of electricity in the\r\nwire of communication is greater than that sustained after the contact is\r\ncompleted; the wire of induction becomes at the moment electro-tonic to an\r\nequivalent degree, which the moment after sinks to the state in which the\r\ncontinuous current can sustain it, but in sinking, causes an opposite\r\ninduced current to that at first produced. The consequence is, that the\r\nfirst induced wave of electricity more resembles that from the discharge of\r\nan electric jar, than it otherwise would do.\r\n\r\n69. But when the iron cylinder is put into the same helix (31.), previous\r\nto the connexion being made with the battery, then the current from the\r\nlatter may be considered as active in inducing innumerable currents of a\r\nsimilar kind to itself in the iron, rendering it a magnet. This is known by\r\nexperiment to occupy time; for a magnet so formed, even of soft iron, does\r\nnot rise to its fullest intensity in an instant, and it may be because the\r\ncurrents within the iron are successive in their formation or arrangement.\r\nBut as the magnet can induce, as well as the battery current, the combined\r\naction of the two continues to evolve induced electricity, until their\r\njoint effect is at a maximum, and thus the existence of the deflecting\r\nforce is prolonged sufficiently to overcome the inertia of the galvanometer\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\n70. In all those cases where the helices or wires are advanced towards or\r\ntaken from the magnet (50. 55.), the direct or inverted current of induced\r\nelectricity continues for the time occupied in the advance or recession;\r\nfor the electro-tonic state is rising to a higher or falling to a lower\r\ndegree during that time, and the change is accompanied by its corresponding\r\nevolution of electricity; but these form no objections to the opinion that\r\nthe electro-tonic state is instantly assumed.\r\n\r\n71. This peculiar state appears to be a state of tension, and may be\r\nconsidered as _equivalent_ to a current of electricity, at least equal to\r\nthat produced either when the condition is induced or destroyed. The\r\ncurrent evolved, however, first or last, is not to be considered a measure\r\nof the degree of tension to which the electro-tonic state has risen; for as\r\nthe metal retains its conducting powers unimpaired (65.), and as the\r\nelectricity evolved is but for a moment, (the peculiar state being\r\ninstantly assumed and lost (68.),) the electricity which may be led away by\r\nlong wire conductors, offering obstruction in their substance proportionate\r\nto their small lateral and extensive linear dimensions, can be but a very\r\nsmall portion of that really evolved within the mass at the moment it\r\nassumes this condition. Insulated helices and portions of metal instantly\r\nassumed the state; and no traces of electricity could be discovered in\r\nthem, however quickly the contact with the electrometer was made, after\r\nthey were put under induction, either by the current from the battery or\r\nthe magnet. A single drop of water or a small piece of moistened paper (23.\r\n56.) was obstacle sufficient to stop the current through the conductors,\r\nthe electricity evolved returning to a state of equilibrium through the\r\nmetal itself, and consequently in an unobserved manner.\r\n\r\n72. The tension of this state may therefore be comparatively very great.\r\nBut whether great or small, it is hardly conceivable that it should exist\r\nwithout exerting a reaction upon the original inducing current, and\r\nproducing equilibrium of some kind. It might be anticipated that this would\r\ngive rise to a retardation of the original current; but I have not been\r\nable to ascertain that this is the case. Neither have I in any other way as\r\nyet been able to distinguish effects attributable to such a reaction.\r\n\r\n73. All the results favour the notion that the electro-tonic state relates\r\nto the particles, and not to the mass, of the wire or substance under\r\ninduction, being in that respect different to the induction exerted by\r\nelectricity of tension. If so, the state may be assumed in liquids when no\r\nelectrical current is sensible, and even in non-conductors; the current\r\nitself, when it occurs, being as it were a contingency due to the existence\r\nof conducting power, and the momentary propulsive force exerted by the\r\nparticles during their arrangement. Even when conducting power is equal,\r\nthe currents of electricity, which as yet are the only indicators of this\r\nstate, may be unequal, because of differences as to numbers, size,\r\nelectrical condition, &c. &c. in the particles themselves. It will only be\r\nafter the laws which govern this new state are ascertained, that we shall\r\nbe able to predict what is the true condition of, and what are the\r\nelectrical results obtainable from, any particular substance.\r\n\r\n74. The current of electricity which induces the electro-tonic state in a\r\nneighbouring wire, probably induces that state also in its own wire; for\r\nwhen by a current in one wire a collateral wire is made electro-tonic, the\r\nlatter state is not rendered any way incompatible or interfering with a\r\ncurrent of electricity passing through it (62.). If, therefore, the current\r\nwere sent through the second wire instead of the first, it does not seem\r\nprobable that its inducing action upon the second would be less, but on the\r\ncontrary more, because the distance between the agent and the matter acted\r\nupon would be very greatly diminished. A copper bolt had its extremities\r\nconnected with a galvanometer, and then the poles of a battery of one\r\nhundred pairs of plates connected with the bolt, so as to send the current\r\nthrough it; the voltaic circuit was then suddenly broken, and the\r\ngalvanometer observed for any indications of a return current through the\r\ncopper bolt due to the discharge of its supposed electro-tonic state. No\r\neffect of the kind was obtained, nor indeed, for two reasons, ought it to\r\nbe expected; for first, as the cessation of induction and the discharge of\r\nthe electro-tonic condition are simultaneous, and not successive, the\r\nreturn current would only be equivalent to the neutralization of the last\r\nportion of the inducing current, and would not therefore show any\r\nalteration of direction; or assuming that time did intervene, and that the\r\nlatter current was really distinct from the former, its short, sudden\r\ncharacter (12. 26.) would prevent it from being thus recognised.\r\n\r\n75. No difficulty arises, I think, in considering the wire thus rendered\r\nelectro-tonic by its own current more than by any external current,\r\nespecially when the apparent non-interference of that state with currents\r\nis considered (62. 71.). The simultaneous existence of the conducting and\r\nelectro-tonic states finds an analogy in the manner in which electrical\r\ncurrents can be passed through magnets, where it is found that both the\r\ncurrents passed, and those of the magnets, preserve all their properties\r\ndistinct from each other, and exert their mutual actions.\r\n\r\n76. The reason given with regard to metals extends also to fluids and all\r\nother conductors, and leads to the conclusion that when electric currents\r\nare passed through them they also assume the electro-tonic state. Should\r\nthat prove to be the case, its influence in voltaic decomposition, and the\r\ntransference of the elements to the poles, can hardly be doubted. In the\r\nelectro-tonic state the homogeneous particles of matter appear to have\r\nassumed a regular but forced electrical arrangement in the direction of the\r\ncurrent, which if the matter be undecomposable, produces, when relieved, a\r\nreturn current; but in decomposable matter this forced state may be\r\nsufficient to make an elementary particle leave its companion, with which\r\nit is in a constrained condition, and associate with the neighbouring\r\nsimilar particle, in relation to which it is in a more natural condition,\r\nthe forced electrical arrangement being itself discharged or relieved, at\r\nthe same time, as effectually as if it had been freed from induction. But\r\nas the original voltaic current is continued, the electro-tonic state may\r\nbe instantly renewed, producing the forced arrangement of the compound\r\nparticles, to be as instantly discharged by a transference of the\r\nelementary particles of the opposite kind in opposite directions, but\r\nparallel to the current. Even the differences between common and voltaic\r\nelectricity, when applied to effect chemical decomposition, which Dr.\r\nWollaston has pointed out[A], seem explicable by the circumstances\r\nconnected with the induction of electricity from these two sources (25.).\r\nBut as I have reserved this branch of the inquiry, that I might follow out\r\nthe investigations contained in the present paper, I refrain (though much\r\ntempted) from offering further speculations.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1801, p. 247.\r\n\r\n77. Marianini has discovered and described a peculiar affection of the\r\nsurfaces of metallic discs, when, being in contact with humid conductors, a\r\ncurrent of electricity is passed through them; they are then capable of\r\nproducing a reverse current of electricity, and Marianini has well applied\r\nthe effect in explanation of the phenomena of Ritter's piles[A]. M.A. de la\r\nRive has described a peculiar property acquired by metallic conductors,\r\nwhen being immersed in a liquid as poles, they have completed, for some\r\ntime, the voltaic circuit, in consequence of which, when separated from the\r\nbattery and plunged into the same fluid, they by themselves produce an\r\nelectric current[B]. M.A. Van Beek has detailed cases in which the\r\nelectrical relation of one metal in contact with another has been preserved\r\nafter separation, and accompanied by its corresponding chemical effects[C].\r\nThese states and results appear to differ from the electro-tonic state and\r\nits phenomena; but the true relation of the former to the latter can only\r\nbe decided when our knowledge of all these phenomena has been enlarged.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, xxxviii. 5.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. xxviii. 190.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. xxxviii. 49.\r\n\r\n78. I had occasion in the commencement of this paper (2.) to refer to an\r\nexperiment by Ampère, as one of those dependent upon the electrical\r\ninduction of currents made prior to the present investigation, and have\r\narrived at conclusions which seem to imply doubts of the accuracy of the\r\nexperiment (62. &c.); it is therefore due to M. Ampère that I should attend\r\nto it more distinctly. When a disc of copper (says M. Ampère) was suspended\r\nby a silk thread and surrounded by a helix or spiral, and when the charge\r\nof a powerful voltaic battery was sent through the spiral, a strong magnet\r\nat the same time being presented to the copper disc, the latter turned at\r\nthe moment to take a position of equilibrium, exactly as the spiral itself\r\nwould have turned had it been free to move. I have not been able to obtain\r\nthis effect, nor indeed any motion; but the cause of my failure in the\r\n_latter_ point may be due to the momentary existence of the current not\r\nallowing time for the inertia of the plate to be overcome (11. 12.). M.\r\nAmpère has perhaps succeeded in obtaining motion from the superior delicacy\r\nand power of his electro-magnetical apparatus, or he may have obtained only\r\nthe motion due to cessation of action. But all my results tend to invert\r\nthe sense of the proposition stated by M. Ampère, \"that a current of\r\nelectricity tends to put the electricity of conductors near which it passes\r\nin motion in the same direction,\" for they indicate an opposite direction\r\nfor the produced current (26. 53.); and they show that the effect is\r\nmomentary, and that it is also produced by magnetic induction, and that\r\ncertain other extraordinary effects follow thereupon.\r\n\r\n79. The momentary existence of the phenomena of induction now described is\r\nsufficient to furnish abundant reasons for the uncertainty or failure of\r\nthe experiments, hitherto made to obtain electricity from magnets, or to\r\neffect chemical decomposition or arrangement by their means[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] The Lycée, No. 36, for January 1st, has a long and rather\r\n  premature article, in which it endeavours to show anticipations by\r\n  French philosophers of my researches. It however mistakes the\r\n  erroneous results of MM. Fresnel and Ampère for true ones, and then\r\n  imagines my true results are like those erroneous ones. I notice it\r\n  here, however, for the purpose of doing honour to Fresnel in a much\r\n  higher degree than would have been merited by a feeble anticipation of\r\n  the present investigations. That great philosopher, at the same time\r\n  with myself and fifty other persons, made experiments which the\r\n  present paper proves could give no expected result. He was deceived\r\n  for the moment, and published his imaginary success; but on more\r\n  carefully repeating his trials, he could find no proof of their\r\n  accuracy; and, in the high and pure philosophic desire to remove error\r\n  as well as discover truth, he recanted his first statement. The\r\n  example of Berzelius regarding the first Thorina is another instance\r\n  of this fine feeling; and as occasions are not rare, it would be to\r\n  the dignity of science if such examples were more frequently\r\n  followed.--February 10th, 1832.\r\n\r\n80. It also appears capable of explaining fully the remarkable phenomena\r\nobserved by M. Arago between metals and magnets when neither are moving\r\n(120.), as well as most of the results obtained by Sir John Herschel,\r\nMessrs. Babbage, Harris, and others, in repeating his experiments;\r\naccounting at the same time perfectly for what at first appeared\r\ninexplicable; namely, the non-action of the same metals and magnets when at\r\nrest. These results, which also afford the readiest means of obtaining\r\nelectricity from magnetism, I shall now proceed to describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _Explication of Arago's Magnetic Phenomena._\r\n\r\n\r\n81. If a plate of copper be revolved close to a magnetic needle, or magnet,\r\nsuspended in such a way that the latter may rotate in a plane parallel to\r\nthat of the former, the magnet tends to follow the motion of the plate; or\r\nif the magnet be revolved, the plate tends to follow its motion; and the\r\neffect is so powerful, that magnets or plates of many pounds weight may be\r\nthus carried round. If the magnet and plate be at rest relative to each\r\nother, not the slightest effect, attractive or repulsive, or of any kind,\r\ncan be observed between them (62.). This is the phenomenon discovered by M.\r\nArago; and he states that the effect takes place not only with all metals,\r\nbut with solids, liquids, and even gases, i.e. with all substances (130.).\r\n\r\n82. Mr. Babbage and Sir John Herschel, on conjointly repeating the\r\nexperiments in this country[A], could obtain the effects only with the\r\nmetals, and with carbon in a peculiar state (from gas retorts), i.e. only\r\nwith excellent conductors of electricity. They refer the effect to\r\nmagnetism induced in the plate by the magnet; the pole of the latter\r\ncausing an opposite pole in the nearest part of the plate, and round this a\r\nmore diffuse polarity of its own kind (120.). The essential circumstance in\r\nproducing the rotation of the suspended magnet is, that the substance\r\nrevolving below it shall acquire and lose its magnetism in sensible time,\r\nand not instantly (124.). This theory refers the effect to an attractive\r\nforce, and is not agreed to by the discoverer, M. Arago, nor by M. Ampère,\r\nwho quote against it the absence of all attraction when the magnet and\r\nmetal are at rest (62. 126.), although the induced magnetism should still\r\nremain; and who, from experiments made with a long dipping needle, conceive\r\nthe action to be always repulsive (125.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1825, p. 467.\r\n\r\n83. Upon obtaining electricity from magnets by the means already described\r\n(36 46.), I hoped to make the experiment of M. Arago a new source of\r\nelectricity; and did not despair, by reference to terrestrial\r\nmagneto-electric induction, of being able to construct a new electrical\r\nmachine. Thus stimulated, numerous experiments were made with the magnet of\r\nthe Royal Society at Mr. Christie's house, in all of which I had the\r\nadvantage of his assistance. As many of these were in the course of the\r\nsuperseded by more perfect arrangements, I shall consider myself at liberty\r\ninvestigation to rearrange them in a manner calculated to convey most\r\nreadily what appears to me to be a correct view of the nature of the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n84. The magnet has been already described (44.). To concentrate the poles,\r\nand bring them nearer to each other, two iron or steel bars, each about six\r\nor seven inches long, one inch wide, and half an inch thick, were put\r\nacross the poles as in fig. 7, and being supported by twine from slipping,\r\ncould be placed as near to or far from each other as was required.\r\nOccasionally two bars of soft iron were employed, so bent that when\r\napplied, one to each pole, the two smaller resulting poles were vertically\r\nover each other, either being uppermost at pleasure.\r\n\r\n85. A disc of copper, twelve inches in diameter, and about one fifth of an\r\ninch in thickness, fixed upon a brass axis, was mounted in frames so as to\r\nallow of revolution either vertically or horizontally, its edge being at\r\nthe same time introduced more or less between the magnetic poles (fig. 7.).\r\nThe edge of the plate was well amalgamated for the purpose of obtaining a\r\ngood but moveable contact, and a part round the axis was also prepared in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\n86. Conductors or electric collectors of copper and lead were constructed\r\nso as to come in contact with the edge of the copper disc (85.), or with\r\nother forms of plates hereafter to be described (101.). These conductors\r\nwere about four inches long, one third of an inch wide, and one fifth of an\r\ninch thick; one end of each was slightly grooved, to allow of more exact\r\nadaptation to the somewhat convex edge of the plates, and then amalgamated.\r\nCopper wires, one sixteenth of an inch in thickness, attached, in the\r\nordinary manner, by convolutions to the other ends of these conductors,\r\npassed away to the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n87. The galvanometer was roughly made, yet sufficiently delicate in its\r\nindications. The wire was of copper covered with silk, and made sixteen or\r\neighteen convolutions. Two sewing-needles were magnetized and fixed on to a\r\nstem of dried grass parallel to each other, but in opposite directions, and\r\nabout half an inch apart; this system was suspended by a fibre of unspun\r\nsilk, so that the lower needle should be between the convolutions of the\r\nmultiplier, and the upper above them. The latter was by much the most\r\npowerful magnet, and gave terrestrial direction to the whole; fig. 8.\r\nrepresents the direction of the wire and of the needles when the instrument\r\nwas placed in the magnetic meridian: the ends of the wires are marked A and\r\nB for convenient reference hereafter. The letters S and N designate the\r\nsouth and north ends of the needle when affected merely by terrestrial\r\nmagnetism; the end N is therefore the marked pole (44.). The whole\r\ninstrument was protected by a glass jar, and stood, as to position and\r\ndistance relative to the large magnet, under the same circumstances as\r\nbefore (45.).\r\n\r\n88. All these arrangements being made, the copper disc was adjusted as in\r\nfig. 7, the small magnetic poles being about half an inch apart, and the\r\nedge of the plate inserted about half their width between them. One of the\r\ngalvanometer wires was passed twice or thrice loosely round the brass axis\r\nof the plate, and the other attached to a conductor (86.), which itself was\r\nretained by the hand in contact with the amalgamated edge of the disc at\r\nthe part immediately between the magnetic poles. Under these circumstances\r\nall was quiescent, and the galvanometer exhibited no effect. But the\r\ninstant the plate moved, the galvanometer was influenced, and by revolving\r\nthe plate quickly the needle could be deflected 90° or more.\r\n\r\n89. It was difficult under the circumstances to make the contact between\r\nthe conductor and the edge of the revolving disc uniformly good and\r\nextensive; it was also difficult in the first experiments to obtain a\r\nregular velocity of rotation: both these causes tended to retain the needle\r\nin a continual state of vibration; but no difficulty existed in\r\nascertaining to which side it was deflected, or generally, about what line\r\nit vibrated. Afterwards, when the experiments were made more carefully, a\r\npermanent deflection of the needle of nearly 45° could be sustained.\r\n\r\n90. Here therefore was demonstrated the production of a permanent current\r\nof electricity by ordinary magnets (57.).\r\n\r\n91. When the motion of the disc was reversed, every other circumstance\r\nremaining the same, the galvanometer needle was deflected with equal power\r\nas before; but the deflection was on the opposite side, and the current of\r\nelectricity evolved, therefore, the reverse of the former.\r\n\r\n92. When the conductor was placed on the edge of the disc a little to the\r\nright or left, as in the dotted positions fig. 9, the current of\r\nelectricity was still evolved, and in the same direction as at first (88.\r\n91.). This occurred to a considerable distance, i.e. 50° or 60° on each\r\nside of the place of the magnetic poles. The current gathered by the\r\nconductor and conveyed to the galvanometer was of the same kind on both\r\nsides of the place of greatest intensity, but gradually diminished in force\r\nfrom that place. It appeared to be equally powerful at equal distances from\r\nthe place of the magnetic poles, not being affected in that respect by the\r\ndirection of the rotation. When the rotation of the disc was reversed, the\r\ndirection of the current of electricity was reversed also; but the other\r\ncircumstances were not affected.\r\n\r\n93. On raising the plate, so that the magnetic poles were entirely hidden\r\nfrom each other by its intervention, (a. fig. 10,) the same effects were\r\nproduced in the same order, and with equal intensity as before. On raising\r\nit still higher, so as to bring the place of the poles to c, still the\r\neffects were produced, and apparently with as much power as at first.\r\n\r\n94. When the conductor was held against the edge as if fixed to it, and\r\nwith it moved between the poles, even though but for a few degrees, the\r\ngalvanometer needle moved and indicated a current of electricity, the same\r\nas that which would have been produced if the wheel had revolved in the\r\nsame direction, the conductor remaining stationary.\r\n\r\n95. When the galvanometer connexion with the axis was broken, and its wires\r\nmade fast to two conductors, both applied to the edge of the copper disc,\r\nthen currents of electricity were produced, presenting more complicated\r\nappearances, but in perfect harmony with the above results. Thus, if\r\napplied as in fig. 11, a current of electricity through the galvanometer\r\nwas produced; but if their place was a little shifted, as in fig. 12, a\r\ncurrent in the contrary direction resulted; the fact being, that in the\r\nfirst instance the galvanometer indicated the difference between a strong\r\ncurrent through A and a weak one through B, and in the second, of a weak\r\ncurrent through A and a strong one through B (92.), and therefore produced\r\nopposite deflections.\r\n\r\n96. So also when the two conductors were equidistant from the magnetic\r\npoles, as in fig. 13, no current at the galvanometer was perceived,\r\nwhichever way the disc was rotated, beyond what was momentarily produced by\r\nirregularity of contact; because equal currents in the same direction\r\ntended to pass into both. But when the two conductors were connected with\r\none wire, and the axis with the other wire, (fig. 14,) then the\r\ngalvanometer showed a current according with the direction of rotation\r\n(91.); both conductors now acting consentaneously, and as a single\r\nconductor did before (88.).\r\n\r\n97. All these effects could be obtained when only one of the poles of the\r\nmagnet was brought near to the plate; they were of the same kind as to\r\ndirection, &c., but by no means so powerful.\r\n\r\n98. All care was taken to render these results independent of the earth's\r\nmagnetism, or of the mutual magnetism of the magnet and galvanometer\r\nneedles. The contacts were made in the magnetic equator of the plate, and\r\nat other parts; the plate was placed horizontally, and the poles\r\nvertically; and other precautions were taken. But the absence of any\r\ninterference of the kind referred to, was readily shown by the want of all\r\neffect when the disc was removed from the poles, or the poles from the\r\ndisc; every other circumstance remaining the same.\r\n\r\n99. The _relation of the current_ of electricity produced, to the magnetic\r\npole, to the direction of rotation of the plate, &c. &c., may be expressed\r\nby saying, that when the unmarked pole (44. 84.) is beneath the edge of the\r\nplate, and the latter revolves horizontally, screw-fashion, the electricity\r\nwhich can be collected at the edge of the plate nearest to the pole is\r\npositive. As the pole of the earth may mentally be considered the unmarked\r\npole, this relation of the rotation, the pole, and the electricity evolved,\r\nis not difficult to remember. Or if, in fig. 15, the circle represent the\r\ncopper disc revolving in the direction of the arrows, and _a_ the outline\r\nof the unmarked pole placed beneath the plate, then the electricity\r\ncollected at _b_ and the neighbouring parts is positive, whilst that\r\ncollected at the centre _c_ and other parts is negative (88.). The currents\r\nin the plate are therefore from the centre by the magnetic poles towards\r\nthe circumference.\r\n\r\n100. If the marked pole be placed above, all other things remaining the\r\nsame, the electricity at _b_, fig. 15, is still positive. If the marked\r\npole be placed below, or the unmarked pole above, the electricity is\r\nreversed. If the direction of revolution in any case is reversed, the\r\nelectricity is also reversed.\r\n\r\n101. It is now evident that the rotating plate is merely another form of\r\nthe simpler experiment of passing a piece of metal between the magnetic\r\npoles in a rectilinear direction, and that in such cases currents of\r\nelectricity are produced at right angles to the direction of the motion,\r\nand crossing it at the place of the magnetic pole or poles. This was\r\nsufficiently shown by the following simple experiment: A piece of copper\r\nplate one fifth of an inch thick, one inch and a half wide, and twelve\r\ninches long, being amalgamated at the edges, was placed between the\r\nmagnetic poles, whilst the two conductors from the galvanometer were held\r\nin contact with its edges; it was then drawn through between the poles of\r\nthe conductors in the direction of the arrow, fig. 16; immediately the\r\ngalvanometer needle was deflected, its north or marked end passed eastward,\r\nindicating that the wire A received negative and the wire B positive\r\nelectricity; and as the marked pole was above, the result is in perfect\r\naccordance with the effect obtained by the rotatory plate (99.).\r\n\r\n102. On reversing the motion of the plate, the needle at the galvanometer\r\nwas deflected in the opposite direction, showing an opposite current.\r\n\r\n103. To render evident the character of the electrical current existing in\r\nvarious parts of the moving copper plate, differing in their relation to\r\nthe inducing poles, one collector (86.) only was applied at the part to be\r\nexamined near to the pole, the other being connected with the end of the\r\nplate as the most neutral place: the results are given at fig. 17-20, the\r\nmarked pole being above the plate. In fig. 17, B received positive\r\nelectricity; but the plate moving in the same direction, it received on the\r\nopposite side, fig. 18, negative electricity: reversing the motion of the\r\nlatter, as in fig. 20, B received positive electricity; or reversing the\r\nmotion of the first arrangement, that of fig. 17 to fig. 19, B received\r\nnegative electricity.\r\n\r\n104. When the plates were previously removed sideways from between the\r\nmagnets, as in fig. 21, so as to be quite out of the polar axis, still the\r\nsame effects were produced, though not so strongly.\r\n\r\n105. When the magnetic poles were in contact, and the copper plate was\r\ndrawn between the conductors near to the place, there was but very little\r\neffect produced. When the poles were opened by the width of a card, the\r\neffect was somewhat more, but still very small.\r\n\r\n106. When an amalgamated copper wire, one eighth of an inch thick, was\r\ndrawn through between the conductors and poles (101.), it produced a very\r\nconsiderable effect, though not so much as the plates.\r\n\r\n107. If the conductors were held permanently against any particular parts\r\nof the copper plates, and carried between the magnetic poles with them,\r\neffects the same as those described were produced, in accordance with the\r\nresults obtained with the revolving disc (94.).\r\n\r\n108. On the conductors being held against the ends of the plates, and the\r\nlatter then passed between the magnetic poles, in a direction transverse to\r\ntheir length, the same effects were produced (fig. 22.). The parts of the\r\nplates towards the end may be considered either as mere conductors, or as\r\nportions of metal in which the electrical current is excited, according to\r\ntheir distance and the strength of the magnet; but the results were in\r\nperfect harmony with those before obtained. The effect was as strong as\r\nwhen the conductors were held against the sides of the plate (101.).\r\n\r\n109. When a mere wire, connected with the galvanometer so as to form a\r\ncomplete circuit, was passed through between the poles, the galvanometer\r\nwas affected; and upon moving the wire to and fro, so as to make the\r\nalternate impulses produced correspond with the vibrations of the needle,\r\nthe latter could be increased to 20° or 30° on each side the magnetic\r\nmeridian.\r\n\r\n110. Upon connecting the ends of a plate of metal with the galvanometer\r\nwires, and then carrying it between the poles from end to end (as in fig.\r\n23.), in either direction, no effect whatever was produced upon the\r\ngalvanometer. But the moment the motion became transverse, the needle was\r\ndeflected.\r\n\r\n111. These effects were also obtained from _electro-magnetic poles_,\r\nresulting from the use of copper helices or spirals, either alone or with\r\niron cores (34. 54.). The directions of the motions were precisely the\r\nsame; but the action was much greater when the iron cores were used, than\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n112. When a flat spiral was passed through edgewise between the poles, a\r\ncurious action at the galvanometer resulted; the needle first went strongly\r\none way, but then suddenly stopped, as if it struck against some solid\r\nobstacle, and immediately returned. If the spiral were passed through from\r\nabove downwards, or from below upwards, still the motion of the needle was\r\nin the same direction, then suddenly stopped, and then was reversed. But on\r\nturning the spiral half-way round, i.e. edge for edge, then the directions\r\nof the motions were reversed, but still were suddenly interrupted and\r\ninverted as before. This double action depends upon the halves of the\r\nspiral (divided by a line passing through its centre perpendicular to the\r\ndirection of its motion) acting in opposite directions; and the reason why\r\nthe needle went to the same side, whether the spiral passed by the poles in\r\nthe one or the other direction, was the circumstance, that upon changing\r\nthe motion, the direction of the wires in the approaching half of the\r\nspiral was changed also. The effects, curious as they appear when\r\nwitnessed, are immediately referable to the action of single wires (40.\r\n109.).\r\n\r\n113. Although the experiments with the revolving plate, wires, and plates\r\nof metal, were first successfully made with the large magnet belonging to\r\nthe Royal Society, yet they were all ultimately repeated with a couple of\r\nbar magnets two feet long, one inch and a half wide, and half an inch\r\nthick; and, by rendering the galvanometer (87.) a little more delicate,\r\nwith the most striking results. Ferro-electro-magnets, as those of Moll,\r\nHenry, &c. (57.), are very powerful. It is very essential, when making\r\nexperiments on different substances, that thermo-electric effects (produced\r\nby contact of the fingers, &c.) be avoided, or at least appreciated and\r\naccounted for; they are easily distinguished by their permanency, and their\r\nindependence of the magnets, or of the direction of the motion.\r\n\r\n114. The relation which holds between the magnetic pole, the moving wire or\r\nmetal, and the direction of the current evolved, i.e. _the law_ which\r\ngoverns the evolution of electricity by magneto-electric induction, is very\r\nsimple, although rather difficult to express. If in fig. 24, PN represent a\r\nhorizontal wire passing by a marked magnetic pole, so that the direction of\r\nits motion shall coincide with the curved line proceeding from below\r\nupwards; or if its motion parallel to itself be in a line tangential to the\r\ncurved line, but in the general direction of the arrows; or if it pass the\r\npole in other directions, but so as to cut the magnetic curves[A] in the\r\nsame general direction, or on the same side as they would be cut by the\r\nwire if moving along the dotted curved line;--then the current of\r\nelectricity in the wire is from P to N. If it be carried in the reverse\r\ndirections, the electric current will be from N to P. Or if the wire be in\r\nthe vertical position, figured P' N', and it be carried in similar\r\ndirections, coinciding with the dotted horizontal curve so far, as to cut\r\nthe magnetic curves on the same side with it, the current will be from P'\r\nto N'. If the wire be considered a tangent to the curved surface of the\r\ncylindrical magnet, and it be carried round that surface into any other\r\nposition, or if the magnet itself be revolved on its axis, so as to bring\r\nany part opposite to the tangential wire,--still, if afterwards the wire be\r\nmoved in the directions indicated, the current of electricity will be from\r\nP to N; or if it be moved in the opposite direction, from N to P; so that\r\nas regards the motions of the wire past the pole, they may be reduced to\r\ntwo, directly opposite to each other, one of which produces a current from\r\nP to N, and the other from N to P.\r\n\r\n  [A] By magnetic curves, I mean the lines of magnetic forces, however\r\n  modified by the juxtaposition of poles, which would be depicted by\r\n  iron filings; or those to which a very small magnetic needle would\r\n  form a tangent.\r\n\r\n115. The same holds true of the unmarked pole of the magnet, except that if\r\nit be substituted for the one in the figure, then, as the wires are moved\r\nin the direction of the arrows, the current of electricity would be from N\r\nto P, and when they move in the reverse direction, from P to N.\r\n\r\n116. Hence the current of electricity which is excited in metal when moving\r\nin the neighbourhood of a magnet, depends for its direction altogether upon\r\nthe relation of the metal to the resultant of magnetic action, or to the\r\nmagnetic curves, and may be expressed in a popular way thus; Let AB (fig.\r\n25.) represent a cylinder magnet, A being the marked pole, and B the\r\nunmarked pole; let PN be a silver knife-blade, resting across the magnet\r\nwith its edge upward, and with its marked or notched side towards the pole\r\nA; then in whatever direction or position this knife be moved edge\r\nforemost, either about the marked or the unmarked pole, the current of\r\nelectricity produced will be from P to N, provided the intersected curves\r\nproceeding from A abut upon the notched surface of the knife, and those\r\nfrom B upon the unnotched side. Or if the knife be moved with its back\r\nforemost, the current will be from N to P in every possible position and\r\ndirection, provided the intersected curves abut on the same surfaces as\r\nbefore. A little model is easily constructed, by using a cylinder of wood\r\nfor a magnet, a flat piece for the blade, and a piece of thread connecting\r\none end of the cylinder with the other, and passing through a hole in the\r\nblade, for the magnetic curves: this readily gives the result of any\r\npossible direction.\r\n\r\n117. When the wire under induction is passing by an electromagnetic pole,\r\nas for instance one end of a copper helix traversed by the electric current\r\n(34.), the direction of the current in the approaching wire is the same\r\nwith that of the current in the parts or sides of the spirals nearest to\r\nit, and in the receding wire the reverse of that in the parts nearest to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n118. All these results show that the power of inducing electric currents is\r\ncircumferentially exerted by a magnetic resultant or axis of power, just as\r\ncircumferential magnetism is dependent upon and is exhibited by an electric\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\n119. The experiments described combine to prove that when a piece of metal\r\n(and the same may be true of all conducting matter (213.) ) is passed\r\neither before a single pole, or between the opposite poles of a magnet, or\r\nnear electro-magnetic poles, whether ferruginous or not, electrical\r\ncurrents are produced across the metal transverse to the direction of\r\nmotion; and which therefore, in Arago's experiments, will approximate\r\ntowards the direction of radii. If a single wire be moved like the spoke of\r\na wheel near a magnetic pole, a current of electricity is determined\r\nthrough it from one end towards the other. If a wheel be imagined,\r\nconstructed of a great number of these radii, and this revolved near the\r\npole, in the manner of the copper disc (85.), each radius will have a\r\ncurrent produced in it as it passes by the pole. If the radii be supposed\r\nto be in contact laterally, a copper disc results, in which the directions\r\nof the currents will be generally the same, being modified only by the\r\ncoaction which can take place between the particles, now that they are in\r\nmetallic contact.\r\n\r\n120. Now that the existence of these currents is known, Arago's phenomena\r\nmay be accounted for without considering them as due to the formation in\r\nthe copper, of a pole of the opposite kind to that approximated, surrounded\r\nby a diffuse polarity of the same kind (82.); neither is it essential that\r\nthe plate should acquire and lose its state in a finite time; nor on the\r\nother hand does it seem necessary that any repulsive force should be\r\nadmitted as the cause of the rotation (82.).\r\n\r\n121. The effect is precisely of the same kind as the electromagnetic\r\nrotations which I had the good fortune to discover some years ago[A].\r\nAccording to the experiments then made which have since been abundantly\r\nconfirmed, if a wire (PN fig. 26.) be connected with the positive and\r\nnegative ends of a voltaic buttery, so that the positive electricity shall\r\npass from P to N, and a marked magnetic pole N be placed near the wire\r\nbetween it and the spectator, the pole will move in a direction tangential\r\nto the wire, i.e. towards the right, and the wire will move tangentially\r\ntowards the left, according to the directions of the arrows. This is\r\nexactly what takes place in the rotation of a plate beneath a magnetic\r\npole; for let N (fig. 27.) be a marked pole above the circular plate, the\r\nlatter being rotated in the direction of the arrow: immediately currents of\r\npositive electricity set from the central parts in the general direction of\r\nthe radii by the pole to the parts of the circumference _a_ on the other\r\nside of that pole (99. 119.), and are therefore exactly in the same\r\nrelation to it as the current in the wire (PN, fig. 26.), and therefore the\r\npole in the same manner moves to the right hand.\r\n\r\n  [A] Quarterly Journal of Science, vol. xii. pp. 74. 186. 416. 283.\r\n\r\n122. If the rotation of the disc be reversed, the electric currents are\r\nreversed (91.), and the pole therefore moves to the left hand. If the\r\ncontrary pole be employed, the effects are the same, i.e. in the same\r\ndirection, because currents of electricity, the reverse of those described,\r\nare produced, and by reversing both poles and currents, the visible effects\r\nremain unchanged. In whatever position the axis of the magnet be placed,\r\nprovided the same pole be applied to the same side of the plate, the\r\nelectric current produced is in the same direction, in consistency with the\r\nlaw already stated (114, &c.); and thus every circumstance regarding the\r\ndirection of the motion may be explained.\r\n\r\n123. These currents are _discharged or return_ in the parts of the plate on\r\neach side of and more distant from the place of the pole, where, of course,\r\nthe magnetic induction is weaker; and when the collectors are applied, and\r\na current of electricity is carried away to the galvanometer (88.), the\r\ndeflection there is merely a repetition, by the same current or part of it,\r\nof the effect of rotation in the magnet over the plate itself.\r\n\r\n124. It is under the point of view just put forth that I have ventured to\r\nsay it is not necessary that the plate should acquire and lose its state in\r\na finite time (120.); for if it were possible for the current to be fully\r\ndeveloped the instant _before_ it arrived at its state of nearest\r\napproximation to the vertical pole of the magnet, instead of opposite to or\r\na little beyond it, still the relative motion of the pole and plate would\r\nbe the same, the resulting force being in fact tangential instead of\r\ndirect.\r\n\r\n125. But it is possible (though not necessary for the rotation) that _time_\r\nmay be required for the development of the maximum current in the plate, in\r\nwhich case the resultant of all the forces would be in advance of the\r\nmagnet when the plate is rotated, or in the rear of the magnet when the\r\nlatter is rotated, and many of the effects with pure electro-magnetic poles\r\ntend to prove this is the case. Then, the tangential force may be resolved\r\ninto two others, one parallel to the plane of rotation, and the other\r\nperpendicular to it; the former would be the force exerted in making the\r\nplate revolve with the magnet, or the magnet with the plate; the latter\r\nwould be a repulsive force, and is probably that, the effects of which M.\r\nArago has also discovered (82.).\r\n\r\n126. The extraordinary circumstance accompanying this action, which has\r\nseemed so inexplicable, namely, the cessation of all phenomena when the\r\nmagnet and metal are brought to rest, now receives a full explanation\r\n(82.); for then the electrical currents which cause the motion cease\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n127. All the effects of solution of metallic continuity, and the consequent\r\ndiminution of power described by Messrs. Babbage and Herschel[A], now\r\nreceive their natural explanation, as well also as the resumption of power\r\nwhen the cuts were filled up by metallic substances, which, though\r\nconductors of electricity, were themselves very deficient in the power of\r\ninfluencing magnets. And new modes of cutting the plate may be devised,\r\nwhich shall almost entirely destroy its power. Thus, if a copper plate\r\n(81.) be cut through at about a fifth or sixth of its diameter from the\r\nedge, so as to separate a ring from it, and this ring be again fastened on,\r\nbut with a thickness of paper intervening (fig. 29.), and if Arago's\r\nexperiment be made with this compound plate so adjusted that the section\r\nshall continually travel opposite the pole, it is evident that the magnetic\r\ncurrents will be greatly interfered with, and the plate probably lose much\r\nof its effect[B].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1825, p. 481.\r\n\r\n  [B] This experiment has actually been made by Mr. Christie, with the\r\n  results here described, and is recorded in the Philosophical\r\n  Transactions for 1827, p. 82.\r\n\r\nAn elementary result of this kind was obtained by using two pieces of thick\r\ncopper, shaped as in fig. 28. When the two neighbouring edges were\r\namalgamated and put together, and the arrangement passed between the poles\r\nof the magnet, in the direction parallel to these edges, a current was\r\nurged through the wires attached to the outer angles, and the galvanometer\r\nbecame strongly affected; but when a single film of paper was interposed,\r\nand the experiment repeated, no sensible effect could be produced.\r\n\r\n128. A section of this kind could not interfere much with the induction of\r\nmagnetism, supposed to be of the nature ordinarily received by iron.\r\n\r\n129. The effect of rotation or deflection of the needle, which M. Arago\r\nobtained by ordinary magnets, M. Ampère succeeded in procuring by\r\nelectro-magnets. This is perfectly in harmony with the results relative to\r\nvolta-electric and magneto-electric induction described in this paper. And\r\nby using flat spirals of copper wire, through which electric currents were\r\nsent, in place of ordinary magnetic poles (Ill.), sometimes applying a\r\nsingle one to one side of the rotating plate, and sometimes two to opposite\r\nsides, I obtained the induced currents of electricity from the plate\r\nitself, and could lead them away to, and ascertain their existence by, the\r\ngalvanometer.\r\n\r\n130. The cause which has now been assigned for the rotation in Arago's\r\nexperiment, namely, the production of electrical currents, seems abundantly\r\nsufficient in all cases where the metals, or perhaps even other conductors,\r\nare concerned; but with regard to such bodies as glass, resins, and, above\r\nall, gases, it seems impossible that currents of electricity, capable of\r\nproducing these effects, should be generated in them. Yet Arago found that\r\nthe effects in question were produced by these and by all bodies tried\r\n(81.). Messrs. Babbage and Herschel, it is true, did not observe them with\r\nany substance not metallic, except carbon, in a highly conducting state\r\n(82.). Mr. Harris has ascertained their occurrence with wood, marble,\r\nfreestone and annealed glass, but obtained no effect with sulphuric acid\r\nand saturated solution of sulphate of iron, although these are better\r\nconductors of electricity than the former substances.\r\n\r\n131. Future investigations will no doubt explain these difficulties, and\r\ndecide the point whether the retarding or dragging action spoken of is\r\nalways simultaneous with electric currents.[A] The existence of the action\r\nin metals, only whilst the currents exist, i.e. whilst motion is given (82.\r\n88.), and the explication of the repulsive action observed by M. Arago (82.\r\n125.), are powerful reasons for referring it to this cause; but it may be\r\ncombined with others which occasionally act alone.\r\n\r\n  [A] Experiments which I have since made convince me that this\r\n  particular action is always due to the electrical currents formed; and\r\n  they supply a test by which it may be distinguished from the action of\r\n  ordinary magnetism, or any other cause, including those which are\r\n  mechanical or irregular, producing similar effects (254.)\r\n\r\n132. Copper, iron, tin, zinc, lead, mercury, and all the metals tried,\r\nproduced electrical currents when passed between the magnetic poles: the\r\nmercury was put into a glass tube for the purpose. The dense carbon\r\ndeposited in coal gas retorts, also produced the current, but ordinary\r\ncharcoal did not. Neither could I obtain any sensible effects with brine,\r\nsulphuric acid, saline solutions, &c., whether rotated in basins, or\r\ninclosed in tubes and passed between the poles.\r\n\r\n133. I have never been able to produce any sensation upon the tongue by the\r\nwires connected with the conductors applied to the edges of the revolving\r\nplate (88.) or slips of metal (101.). Nor have I been able to heat a fine\r\nplatina wire, or produce a spark, or convulse the limbs of a frog. I have\r\nfailed also to produce any chemical effects by electricity thus evolved\r\n(22. 56).\r\n\r\n134. As the electric current in the revolving copper plate occupies but a\r\nsmall space, proceeding by the poles and being discharged right and left at\r\nvery small distances comparatively (123.); and as it exists in a thick mass\r\nof metal possessing almost the highest conducting power of any, and\r\nconsequently offering extraordinary facility for its production and\r\ndischarge; and as, notwithstanding this, considerable currents may be drawn\r\noff which can pass through narrow wires, forty, fifty, sixty, or even one\r\nhundred feet long; it is evident that the current existing in the plate\r\nitself must be a very powerful one, when the rotation is rapid and the\r\nmagnet strong. This is also abundantly proved by the obedience and\r\nreadiness with which a magnet ten or twelve pounds in weight follows the\r\nmotion of the plate and will strongly twist up the cord by which it is\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\n135. Two rough trials were made with the intention of constructing\r\n_magneto-electric machines_. In one, a ring one inch and a half broad and\r\ntwelve inches external diameter, cut from a thick copper plate, was mounted\r\nso as to revolve between the poles of the magnet and represent a plate\r\nsimilar to those formerly used (101.), but of interminable length; the\r\ninner and outer edges were amalgamated, and the conductors applied one to\r\neach edge, at the place of the magnetic poles. The current of electricity\r\nevolved did not appear by the galvanometer to be stronger, if so strong, as\r\nthat from the circular plate (88.).\r\n\r\n136. In the other, small thick discs of copper or other metal, half an inch\r\nin diameter, were revolved rapidly near to the poles, but with the axis of\r\nrotation out of the polar axis; the electricity evolved was collected by\r\nconductors applied as before to the edges (86.). Currents were procured,\r\nbut of strength much inferior to that produced by the circular plate.\r\n\r\n137. The latter experiment is analogous to those made by Mr. Barlow with a\r\nrotating iron shell, subject to the influence of the earth[A]. The effects\r\nobtained by him have been referred by Messrs. Babbage and Herschel to the\r\nsame cause as that considered as influential in Arago's experiment[B]; but\r\nit would be interesting to know how far the electric current which might be\r\nproduced in the experiment would account for the deflexion of the needle.\r\nThe mere inversion of a copper wire six or seven times near the poles of\r\nthe magnet, and isochronously with the vibrations of the galvanometer\r\nneedle connected with it, was sufficient to make the needle vibrate through\r\nan arc of 60° or 70°. The rotation of a copper shell would perhaps decide\r\nthe point, and might even throw light upon the more permanent, though\r\nsomewhat analogous effects obtained by Mr. Christie.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1825. p. 317.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. 1825. p. 485.\r\n\r\n138. The remark which has already been made respecting iron (66.), and the\r\nindependence of the ordinary magnetical phenomena of that substance and the\r\nphenomena now described of magneto-electric induction in that and other\r\nmetals, was fully confirmed by many results of the kind detailed in this\r\nsection. When an iron plate similar to the copper one formerly described\r\n(101.) was passed between the magnetic poles, it gave a current of\r\nelectricity like the copper plate, but decidedly of less power; and in the\r\nexperiments upon the induction of electric currents (9.), no difference in\r\nthe kind of action between iron and other metals could be perceived. The\r\npower therefore of an iron plate to drag a magnet after it, or to intercept\r\nmagnetic action, should be carefully distinguished from the similar power\r\nof such metals as silver, copper, &c. &c., inasmuch as in the iron by far\r\nthe greater part of the effect is due to what may be called ordinary\r\nmagnetic action. There can be no doubt that the cause assigned by Messrs.\r\nBabbage and Herschel in explication of Arago's phenomena is the true one,\r\nwhen iron is the metal used.\r\n\r\n139. The very feeble powers which were found by those philosophers to\r\nbelong to bismuth and antimony, when moving, of affecting the suspended\r\nmagnet, and which has been confirmed by Mr. Harris, seem at first\r\ndisproportionate to their conducting powers; whether it be so or not must\r\nbe decided by future experiment (73.)[A]. These metals are highly\r\ncrystalline, and probably conduct electricity with different degrees of\r\nfacility in different directions; and it is not unlikely that where a mass\r\nis made up of a number of crystals heterogeneously associated, an effect\r\napproaching to that of actual division may occur (127.); or the currents of\r\nelectricity may become more suddenly deflected at the confines of similar\r\ncrystalline arrangements, and so be more readily and completely discharged\r\nwithin the mass.\r\n\r\n  [A] I have since been able to explain these differences, and prove,\r\n  with several metals, that the effect is in the order of the conducting\r\n  power; for I have been able to obtain, by magneto-electric induction,\r\n  currents of electricity which are proportionate in strength to the\r\n  conducting power of the bodies experimented with (211.).\r\n\r\n§. _Royal Institution, November 1831._\r\n\r\n_Note._--In consequence of the long period which has intervened between the\r\nreading and printing of the foregoing paper, accounts of the experiments\r\nhave been dispersed, and, through a letter of my own to M. Hachette, have\r\nreached France and Italy. That letter was translated (with some errors),\r\nand read to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, 26th December, 1831. A copy\r\nof it in _Le Temps_ of the 28th December quickly reached Signor Nobili,\r\nwho, with Signor Antinori, immediately experimented upon the subject, and\r\nobtained many of the results mentioned in my letter; others they could not\r\nobtain or understand, because of the brevity of my account. These results\r\nby Signori Nobili and Antinori have been embodied in a paper dated 31st\r\nJanuary 1832, and printed and published in the number of the _Antologia_\r\ndated November 1831 (according at least to the copy of the paper kindly\r\nsent me by Signor Nobili). It is evident the work could not have been then\r\nprinted; and though Signor Nobili, in his paper, has inserted my letter as\r\nthe text of his experiments, yet the circumstance of back date has caused\r\nmany here, who have heard of Nobili's experiments by report only, to\r\nimagine his results were anterior to, instead of being dependent upon,\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nI may be allowed under these circumstances to remark, that I experimented\r\non this subject several years ago, and have published results. (See\r\nQuarterly Journal of Science for July 1825, p. 338.) The following also is\r\nan extract from my note-book, dated November 28, 1825: \"Experiments on\r\ninduction by connecting wire of voltaic battery:--a battery of four\r\ntroughs, ten pairs of plates, each arranged side by side--the poles\r\nconnected by a wire about four feet long, parallel to which was another\r\nsimilar wire separated from it only by two thicknesses of paper, the ends\r\nof the latter were attached to a galvanometer:--exhibited no action, &c.\r\n&c. &c.--Could not in any way render any induction evident from the\r\nconnecting wire.\" The cause of failure at that time is now evident\r\n(79.).--M.F. April, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SERIES.\r\n\r\nTHE BAKERIAN LECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _Terrestrial Magneto-electric Induction._ § 6. _Force and Direction of\r\nMagneto-electric Induction generally._\r\n\r\nRead January 12, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _Terrestrial Magneto-electric Induction._\r\n\r\n140. When the general facts described in the former paper were discovered,\r\nand the _law_ of magneto-electric induction relative to direction was\r\nascertained (114.), it was not difficult to perceive that the earth would\r\nproduce the same effect as a magnet, and to an extent that would, perhaps,\r\nrender it available in the construction of new electrical machines. The\r\nfollowing are some of the results obtained in pursuance of this view.\r\n\r\n141. The hollow helix already described (6.) was connected with a\r\ngalvanometer by wires eight feet long; and the soft iron cylinder (34.)\r\nafter being heated red-hot and slowly cooled, to remove all traces of\r\nmagnetism, was put into the helix so as to project equally at both ends,\r\nand fixed there. The combined helix and bar were held in the magnetic\r\ndirection or line of dip, and (the galvanometer needle being motionless)\r\nwere then inverted, so that the lower end should become the upper, but the\r\nwhole still correspond to the magnetic direction; the needle was\r\nimmediately deflected. As the latter returned to its first position, the\r\nhelix and bar were again inverted; and by doing this two or three times,\r\nmaking the inversions and vibrations to coincide, the needle swung through\r\nan arc of 150° or 160°.\r\n\r\n142. When one end of the helix, which may be called A, was uppermost at\r\nfirst (B end consequently being below), then it mattered not in which\r\ndirection it proceeded during the inversion, whether to the right hand or\r\nleft hand, or through any other course; still the galvanometer needle\r\npassed in the same direction. Again, when B end was uppermost, the\r\ninversion of the helix and bar in any direction always caused the needle to\r\nbe deflected one way; that way being the opposite to the course of the\r\ndeflection in the former case.\r\n\r\n143. When the helix with its iron core in any given position was inverted,\r\nthe effect was as if a magnet with its marked pole downwards had been\r\nintroduced from above into the inverted helix. Thus, if the end B were\r\nupwards, such a magnet introduced from above would make the marked end of\r\nthe galvanometer needle pass west. Or the end B being downwards, and the\r\nsoft iron in its place, inversion of the whole produced the same effect.\r\n\r\n144. When the soft iron bar was taken out of the helix and inverted in\r\nvarious directions within four feet of the galvanometer, not the slightest\r\neffect upon it was produced.\r\n\r\n145. These phenomena are the necessary consequence of the inductive\r\nmagnetic power of the earth, rendering the soft iron cylinder a magnet with\r\nits marked pole downwards. The experiment is analogous to that in which two\r\nbar magnets were used to magnetize the same cylinder in the same helix\r\n(36.), and the inversion of position in the present experiment is\r\nequivalent to a change of the poles in that arrangement. But the result is\r\nnot less an instance of the evolution of electricity by means of the\r\nmagnetism of the globe.\r\n\r\n146. The helix alone was then held permanently in the magnetic direction,\r\nand the soft iron cylinder afterwards introduced; the galvanometer needle\r\nwas instantly deflected; by withdrawing the cylinder as the needle\r\nreturned, and continuing the two actions simultaneously, the vibrations\r\nsoon extended through an arc of 180°. The effect was precisely the same as\r\nthat obtained by using a cylinder magnet with its marked pole downwards;\r\nand the direction of motion, &c. was perfectly in accordance with the\r\nresults of former experiments obtained with such a magnet (39.). A magnet\r\nin that position being used, gave the same deflections, but stronger. When\r\nthe helix was put at right angles to the magnetic direction or dip, then\r\nthe introduction or removal of the soft iron cylinder produced no effect at\r\nthe needle. Any inclination to the dip gave results of the same kind as\r\nthose already described, but increasing in strength as the helix\r\napproximated to the direction of the dip.\r\n\r\n147. A cylinder magnet, although it has great power of affecting the\r\ngalvanometer when moving into or out of the helix, has no power of\r\ncontinuing the deflection (39.); and therefore, though left in, still the\r\nmagnetic needle comes to its usual place of rest. But upon repeating (with\r\nthe magnet) the experiment of inversion in the direction of the dip (141),\r\nthe needle was affected as powerfully as before; the disturbance of the\r\nmagnetism in the steel magnet, by the earth's inductive force upon it,\r\nbeing thus shown to be nearly, if not quite, equal in amount and rapidity\r\nto that occurring in soft iron. It is probable that in this way\r\nmagneto-electrical arrangements may become very useful in indicating the\r\ndisturbance of magnetic forces, where other means will not apply; for it is\r\nnot the whole magnetic power which produces the visible effect, but only\r\nthe difference due to the disturbing causes.\r\n\r\n148. These favourable results led me to hope that the direct\r\nmagneto-electric induction of the earth might be rendered sensible; and I\r\nultimately succeeded in obtaining the effect in several ways. When the\r\nhelix just referred to (141. 6.) was placed in the magnetic dip, but\r\nwithout any cylinder of iron or steel, and was then inverted, a feeble\r\naction at the needle was observed. Inverting the helix ten or twelve times,\r\nand at such periods that the deflecting forces exerted by the currents of\r\nelectricity produced in it should be added to the momentum of the needle\r\n(39.), the latter was soon made to vibrate through an arc of 80° or 90°.\r\nHere, therefore, currents of electricity were produced by the direct\r\ninductive power of the earth's magnetism, without the use of any\r\nferruginous matter, and upon a metal not capable of exhibiting any of the\r\nordinary magnetic phenomena. The experiment in everything represents the\r\neffects produced by bringing the same helix to one or both poles of any\r\npowerful magnet (50.).\r\n\r\n149. Guided by the law already expressed (114.), I expected that all the\r\nelectric phenomena of the revolving metal plate could now be produced\r\nwithout any other magnet than the earth. The plate so often referred to\r\n(85.) was therefore fixed so as to rotate in a horizontal plane. The\r\nmagnetic curves of the earth (114. _note_), i.e. the dip, passes through\r\nthis plane at angles of about 70°, which it was expected would be an\r\napproximation to perpendicularity, quite enough to allow of\r\nmagneto-electric induction sufficiently powerful to produce a current of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n150. Upon rotation of the plate, the currents ought, according to the law\r\n(114. 121.), to tend to pass in the direction of the radii, through _all_\r\nparts of the plate, either from the centre to the circumference, or from\r\nthe circumference to the centre, as the direction of the rotation of the\r\nplate was one way or the other. One of the wires of the galvanometer was\r\ntherefore brought in contact with the axis of the plate, and the other\r\nattached to a leaden collector or conductor (86.), which itself was placed\r\nagainst the amalgamated edge of the disc. On rotating the plate there was a\r\ndistinct effect at the galvanometer needle; on reversing the rotation, the\r\nneedle went in the opposite direction; and by making the action of the\r\nplate coincide with the vibrations of the needle, the arc through which the\r\nlatter passed soon extended to half a circle.\r\n\r\n151. Whatever part of the edge of the plate was touched by the conductor,\r\nthe electricity was the same, provided the direction of rotation continued\r\nunaltered.\r\n\r\n152. When the plate revolved _screw-fashion_, or as the hands of a watch,\r\nthe current of electricity (150.) was from the centre to the circumference;\r\nwhen the direction of rotation was _unscrew_, the current was from the\r\ncircumference to the centre. These directions are the same with those\r\nobtained when the unmarked pole of a magnet was placed beneath the\r\nrevolving plate (99.).\r\n\r\n153. When the plate was in the magnetic meridian, or in any other plane\r\n_coinciding_ with the magnetic dip, then its rotation produced no effect\r\nupon the galvanometer. When inclined to the dip but a few degrees,\r\nelectricity began to appear upon rotation. Thus when standing upright in a\r\nplane perpendicular to the magnetic meridian, and when consequently its own\r\nplane was inclined only about 20° to the dip, revolution of the plate\r\nevolved electricity. As the inclination was increased, the electricity\r\nbecame more powerful until the angle formed by the plane of the plate with\r\nthe dip was 90°, when the electricity for a given velocity of the plate was\r\na maximum.\r\n\r\n154. It is a striking thing to observe the revolving copper plate become\r\nthus a _new electrical machine_; and curious results arise on comparing it\r\nwith the common machine. In the one, the plate is of the best\r\nnon-conducting substance that can be applied; in the other, it is the most\r\nperfect conductor: in the one, insulation is essential; in the other, it is\r\nfatal. In comparison of the quantities of electricity produced, the metal\r\nmachine does not at all fall below the glass one; for it can produce a\r\nconstant current capable of deflecting the galvanometer needle, whereas the\r\nlatter cannot. It is quite true that the force of the current thus evolved\r\nhas not as yet been increased so as to render it available in any of our\r\nordinary applications of this power; but there appears every reasonable\r\nexpectation that this may hereafter be effected; and probably by several\r\narrangements. Weak as the current may seem to be, it is as strong as, if\r\nnot stronger than, any thermo-electric current; for it can pass fluids\r\n(23.), agitate the animal system, and in the case of an electro-magnet has\r\nproduced sparks (32.).\r\n\r\n155. A disc of copper, one fifth of an inch thick and only one inch and a\r\nhalf in diameter, was amalgamated at the edge; a square piece of sheet lead\r\n(copper would have been better) of equal thickness had a circular hole cut\r\nin it, into which the disc loosely fitted; a little mercury completed the\r\nmetallic communication of the disc and its surrounding ring; the latter was\r\nattached to one of the galvanometer wires, and the other wire dipped into a\r\nlittle metallic cup containing mercury, fixed upon the top of the copper\r\naxis of the small disc. Upon rotating the disc in a horizontal plane, the\r\ngalvanometer needle could be affected, although the earth was the only\r\nmagnet employed, and the radius of the disc but three quarters of an inch;\r\nin which space only the current was excited.\r\n\r\n156. On putting the pole of a magnet under the revolving disc, the\r\ngalvanometer needle could be permanently deflected.\r\n\r\n157. On using copper wires one sixth of an inch in thickness instead of the\r\nsmaller wires (86.) hitherto constantly employed, far more powerful effects\r\nwere obtained. Perhaps if the galvanometer had consisted of fewer turns of\r\nthick wire instead of many convolutions of thinner, more striking effects\r\nwould have been produced.\r\n\r\n158. One form of apparatus which I purpose having arranged, is to have\r\nseveral discs superposed; the discs are to be metallically connected,\r\nalternately at the edges and at the centres, by means of mercury; and are\r\nthen to be revolved alternately in opposite directions, i.e. the first,\r\nthird, fifth, &c. to the right hand, and the second, fourth, sixth, &c. to\r\nthe left hand; the whole being placed so that the discs are perpendicular\r\nto the dip, or intersect most directly the magnetic curves of powerful\r\nmagnets. The electricity will be from the centre to the circumference in\r\none set of discs, and from the circumference to the centre in those on each\r\nside of them; thus the action of the whole will conjoin to produce one\r\ncombined and more powerful current.\r\n\r\n159. I have rather, however, been desirous of discovering new facts and new\r\nrelations dependent on magneto-electric induction, than of exalting the\r\nforce of those already obtained; being assured that the latter would find\r\ntheir full development hereafter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n160. I referred in my former paper to the probable influence of terrestrial\r\nmagneto-electric induction (137.) in producing, either altogether or in\r\npart, the phenomena observed by Messrs. Christie and Barlow[A], whilst\r\nrevolving ferruginous bodies; and especially those observed by the latter\r\nwhen rapidly rotating an iron shell, which were by that philosopher\r\nreferred to a change in the ordinary disposition of the magnetism of the\r\nball. I suggested also that the rotation of a copper globe would probably\r\ninsulate the effects due to electric currents from those due to mere\r\nderangement of magnetism, and throw light upon the true nature of the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n  [A] Christie, Phil. Trans. 1825, pp. 58, 347, &c. Barlow, Phil. Trans.\r\n  1825, p. 317.\r\n\r\n161. Upon considering the law already referred to (114.), it appeared\r\nimpossible that a metallic globe could revolve under natural circumstances,\r\nwithout having electric currents produced within it, circulating round the\r\nrevolving globe in a plane at right angles to the plane of revolution,\r\nprovided its axis of rotation did not coincide with the dip; and it\r\nappeared that the current would be most powerful when the axis of\r\nrevolution was perpendicular to the dip of the needle: for then all those\r\nparts of the ball below a plane passing through its centre and\r\nperpendicular to the dip, would in moving cut the magnetic curves in one\r\ndirection, whilst all those parts above that plane would intersect them in\r\nthe other direction: currents therefore would exist in these moving parts,\r\nproceeding from one pole of rotation to the other; but the currents above\r\nwould be in the reverse direction to those below, and in conjunction with\r\nthem would produce a continued circulation of electricity.\r\n\r\n162. As the electric currents are nowhere interrupted in the ball, powerful\r\neffects were expected, and I endeavoured to obtain them with simple\r\napparatus. The ball I used was of brass; it had belonged to an old\r\nelectrical machine, was hollow, thin (too thin), and four inches in\r\ndiameter; a brass wire was screwed into it, and the ball either turned in\r\nthe hand by the wire, or sometimes, to render it more steady, supported by\r\nits wire in a notched piece of wood, and motion again given by the hand.\r\nThe ball gave no signs of magnetism when at rest.\r\n\r\n163. A compound magnetic needle was used to detect the currents. It was\r\narranged thus: a sewing-needle had the head and point broken off, and was\r\nthen magnetised; being broken in halves, the two magnets thus produced were\r\nfixed on a stem of dried grass, so as to be perpendicular to it, and about\r\nfour inches asunder; they were both in one plane, but their similar poles\r\nin contrary directions. The grass was attached to a piece of unspun silk\r\nabout six inches long, the latter to a stick passing through a cork in the\r\nmouth of a cylindrical jar; and thus a compound arrangement was obtained,\r\nperfectly sheltered from the motion of the air, but little influenced by\r\nthe magnetism of the earth, and yet highly sensible to magnetic and\r\nelectric forces, when the latter were brought into the vicinity of the one\r\nor the other needle.\r\n\r\n164. Upon adjusting the needles to the plane of the magnetic meridian;\r\narranging the ball on the outside of the glass jar to the west of the\r\nneedles, and at such a height that its centre should correspond\r\nhorizontally with the upper needle, whilst its axis was in the plane of the\r\nmagnetic meridian, but perpendicular to the dip; and then rotating the\r\nball, the needle was immediately affected. Upon inverting the direction of\r\nrotation, the needle was again affected, but in the opposite direction.\r\nWhen the ball revolved from east over to west, the marked pole went\r\neastward; when the ball revolved in the opposite direction, the marked pole\r\nwent westward or towards the ball. Upon placing the ball to the east of the\r\nneedles, still the needle was deflected in the same way; i.e. when the ball\r\nrevolved from east over to west, the marked pole wont eastward (or towards\r\nthe ball); when the rotation was in the opposite direction, the marked pole\r\nwent westward.\r\n\r\n165. By twisting the silk of the needles, the latter were brought into a\r\nposition perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic meridian; the ball was\r\nagain revolved, with its axis parallel to the needles; the upper was\r\naffected as before, and the deflection was such as to show that both here\r\nand in the former case the needle was influenced solely by currents of\r\nelectricity existing in the brass globe.\r\n\r\n166. If the upper part of the revolving ball be considered as a wire moving\r\nfrom east to west, over the unmarked pole of the earth, the current of\r\nelectricity in it should be from north to south (99. 114. 150.); if the\r\nunder part be considered as a similar wire, moving from west to east over\r\nthe same pole, the electric current should be from south to north; and the\r\ncirculation of electricity should therefore be from north above to south,\r\nand below back to north, in a metal ball revolving from east above to west\r\nin these latitudes. Now these currents are exactly those required to give\r\nthe directions of the needle in the experiments just described; so that the\r\ncoincidence of the theory from which the experiments were deduced with the\r\nexperiments themselves, is perfect.\r\n\r\n167. Upon inclining the axis of rotation considerably, the revolving ball\r\nwas still found to affect the magnetic needle; and it was not until the\r\nangle which it formed with the magnetic dip was rendered small, that its\r\neffects, even upon this apparatus, were lost (153.). When revolving with\r\nits axis parallel to the dip, it is evident that the globe becomes\r\nanalogous to the copper plate; electricity of one kind might be collected\r\nat its equator, and of the other kind at its poles.\r\n\r\n168. A current in the ball, such as that described above (161.), although\r\nit ought to deflect a needle the same way whether it be to the right or the\r\nleft of the ball and of the axis of rotation, ought to deflect it the\r\ncontrary way when above or below the ball; for then the needle is, or ought\r\nto be, acted upon in a contrary direction by the current. This expectation\r\nwas fulfilled by revolving the ball beneath the magnetic needle, the latter\r\nbeing still inclosed in its jar. When the ball was revolved from east over\r\nto west, the marked pole of the needle, instead of passing eastward, went\r\nwestward; and when revolved from west over to east, the marked pole went\r\neastward.\r\n\r\n169. The deflections of the magnetic needle thus obtained with a brass ball\r\nare exactly in the same direction as those observed by Mr. Barlow in the\r\nrevolution of the iron shell; and from the manner in which iron exhibits\r\nthe phenomena of magneto-electric induction like any other metal, and\r\ndistinct from its peculiar magnetic phenomena (132.), it is impossible but\r\nthat electric currents must have been excited, and become active in those\r\nexperiments. What proportion of the whole effect obtained is due to this\r\ncause, must be decided by a more elaborate investigation of all the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n170. These results, in conjunction with the general law before stated\r\n(114.), suggested an experiment of extreme simplicity, which yet, on trial,\r\nwas found to answer perfectly. The exclusion of all extraneous\r\ncircumstances and complexity of arrangement, and the distinct character of\r\nthe indications afforded, render this single experiment an epitome of\r\nnearly all the facts of magneto-electric induction.\r\n\r\n171. A piece of common copper wire, about eight feet long and one twentieth\r\nof an inch in thickness, had one of its ends fastened to one of the\r\nterminations of the galvanometer wire, and the other end to the other\r\ntermination; thus it formed an endless continuation of the galvanometer\r\nwire: it was then roughly adjusted into the shape of a rectangle, or rather\r\nof a loop, the upper part of which could be carried to and fro over the\r\ngalvanometer, whilst the lower part, and the galvanometer attached to it,\r\nremained steady (Plate II. fig. 30.). Upon moving this loop over the\r\ngalvanometer from right to left, the magnetic needle was immediately\r\ndeflected; upon passing the loop back again, the needle passed in the\r\ncontrary direction to what it did before; upon repeating these motions of\r\nthe loop in accordance with the vibrations of the needle (39.), the latter\r\nsoon swung through 90° or more.\r\n\r\n172. The relation of the current of electricity produced in the wire, to\r\nits motion, may be understood by supposing the convolutions at the\r\ngalvanometer away, and the wire arranged as a rectangle, with its lower\r\nedge horizontal and in the plane of the magnetic meridian, and a magnetic\r\nneedle suspended above and over the middle part of this edge, and directed\r\nby the earth (fig. 30.). On passing the upper part of the rectangle from\r\nwest to east into the position represented by the dotted line, the marked\r\npole of the magnetic needle went west; the electric current was therefore\r\nfrom north to south in the part of the wire passing under the needle, and\r\nfrom south to north in the moving or upper part of the parallelogram. On\r\npassing the upper part of the rectangle from east to west over the\r\ngalvanometer, the marked pole of the needle went east, and the current of\r\nelectricity was therefore the reverse of the former.\r\n\r\n173. When the rectangle was arranged in a plane east and west, and the\r\nmagnetic needle made parallel to it, either by the torsion of its\r\nsuspension thread or the action of a magnet, still the general effects were\r\nthe same. On moving the upper part of the rectangle from north to south,\r\nthe marked pole of the needle went north; when the wire was moved in the\r\nopposite direction, the marked pole went south. The same effect took place\r\nwhen the motion of the wire was in any other azimuth of the line of dip;\r\nthe direction of the current always being conformable to the law formerly\r\nexpressed (114.), and also to the directions obtained with the rotating\r\nball (101.).\r\n\r\n174. In these experiments it is not necessary to move the galvanometer or\r\nneedle from its first position. It is quite sufficient if the wire of the\r\nrectangle is distorted where it leaves the instrument, and bent so as to\r\nallow the moving upper part to travel in the desired direction.\r\n\r\n175. The moveable part of the wire was then arranged _below_ the\r\ngalvanometer, but so as to be carried across the dip. It affected the\r\ninstrument as before, and in the same direction; i.e. when carried from\r\nwest to east under the instrument, the marked end of the needle went west,\r\nas before. This should, of course, be the case; for when the wire is\r\ncutting the magnetic dip in a certain direction, an electric current also\r\nin a certain direction should be induced in it.\r\n\r\n176. If in fig. 31 _dp_ be parallel to the dip, and BA be considered as the\r\nupper part of the rectangle (171.), with an arrow _c_ attached to it, both\r\nthese being retained in a plane perpendicular to the dip,--then, however BA\r\nwith its attached arrow is moved upon _dp_ as an axis, if it afterwards\r\nproceed in the direction of the arrow, a current of electricity will move\r\nalong it from B towards A.\r\n\r\n177. When the moving part of the wire was carried up or down parallel to\r\nthe dip, no effect was produced on the galvanometer. When the direction of\r\nmotion was a little inclined to the dip, electricity manifested itself; and\r\nwas at a maximum when the motion was perpendicular to the magnetic\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n178. When the wire was bent into other forms and moved, equally strong\r\neffects were obtained, especially when instead of a rectangle a double\r\ncatenarian curve was formed of it on one side of the galvanometer, and the\r\ntwo single curves or halves were swung in opposite directions at the same\r\ntime; their action then combined to affect the galvanometer: but all the\r\nresults were reducible to those above described.\r\n\r\n179. The longer the extent of the moving wire, and the greater the space\r\nthrough which it moves, the greater is the effect upon the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n180. The facility with which electric currents are produced in metals when\r\nmoving under the influence of magnets, suggests that henceforth precautions\r\nshould always be taken, in experiments upon metals and magnets, to guard\r\nagainst such effects. Considering the universality of the magnetic\r\ninfluence of the earth, it is a consequence which appears very\r\nextraordinary to the mind, that scarcely any piece of metal can be moved in\r\ncontact with others, either at rest, or in motion with different velocities\r\nor in varying directions, without an electric current existing within them.\r\nIt is probable that amongst arrangements of steam-engines and metal\r\nmachinery, some curious accidental magneto-electric combinations may be\r\nfound, producing effects which have never been observed, or, if noticed,\r\nhave never as yet been understood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n181. Upon considering the effects of terrestrial magneto-electric induction\r\nwhich have now been described, it is almost impossible to resist the\r\nimpression that similar effects, but infinitely greater in force, may be\r\nproduced by the action of the globe, as a magnet, upon its own mass, in\r\nconsequence of its diurnal rotation. It would seem that if a bar of metal\r\nbe laid in these latitudes on the surface of the earth parallel to the\r\nmagnetic meridian, a current of electricity tends to pass through it from\r\nsouth to north, in consequence of the travelling of the bar from west to\r\neast (172.), by the rotation of the earth; that if another bar in the same\r\ndirection be connected with the first by wires, it cannot discharge the\r\ncurrent of the first, because it has an equal tendency to have a current in\r\nthe same direction induced within itself: but that if the latter be carried\r\nfrom east to west, which is equivalent to a diminution of the motion\r\ncommunicated to it from the earth (172.), then the electric current from\r\nsouth to north is rendered evident in the first bar, in consequence of its\r\ndischarge, at the same time, by means of the second.\r\n\r\n182. Upon the supposition that the rotation of the earth tended, by\r\nmagneto-electric induction, to cause currents in its own mass, these would,\r\naccording to the law (114.) and the experiments, be, upon the surface at\r\nleast, from the parts in the neighbourhood of or towards the plane of the\r\nequator, in opposite directions to the poles; and if collectors could be\r\napplied at the equator and at the poles of the globe, as has been done with\r\nthe revolving copper plate (150.), and also with magnets (220.), then\r\nnegative electricity would be collected at the equator, and positive\r\nelectricity at both poles (222.). But without the conductors, or something\r\nequivalent to them, it is evident these currents could not exist, as they\r\ncould not be discharged.\r\n\r\n183. I did not think it impossible that some natural difference might occur\r\nbetween bodies, relative to the intensity of the current produced or\r\ntending to be produced in them by magneto-electric induction, which might\r\nbe shown by opposing them to each other; especially as Messrs. Arago,\r\nBabbage, Herschel, and Harris, have all found great differences, not only\r\nbetween the metals and other substances, but between the metals themselves,\r\nin their power of receiving motion from or giving it to a magnet in trials\r\nby revolution (130.). I therefore took two wires, each one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet long, one of iron and the other of copper. These were connected\r\nwith each other at their ends, and then extended in the direction of the\r\nmagnetic meridian, so as to form two nearly parallel lines, nowhere in\r\ncontact except at the extremities. The copper wire was then divided in the\r\nmiddle, and examined by a delicate galvanometer, but no evidence of an\r\nelectrical current was obtained.\r\n\r\n184. By favour of His Royal Highness the President of the Society, I\r\nobtained the permission of His Majesty to make experiments at the lake in\r\nthe gardens of Kensington-palace, for the purpose of comparing, in a\r\nsimilar manner, water and metal. The basin of this lake is artificial; the\r\nwater is supplied by the Chelsea Company; no springs run into it, and it\r\npresented what I required, namely, a uniform mass of still pure water, with\r\nbanks ranging nearly from east to west, and from north to south.\r\n\r\n185. Two perfectly clean bright copper plates, each exposing four square\r\nfeet of surface, were soldered to the extremities of a copper wire; the\r\nplates were immersed in the water, north and south of each other, the wire\r\nwhich connected them being arranged upon the grass of the bank. The plates\r\nwere about four hundred and eighty feet from each other, in a right line;\r\nthe wire was probably six hundred feet long. This wire was then divided in\r\nthe middle, and connected by two cups of mercury with a delicate\r\ngalvanometer.\r\n\r\n186. At first, indications of electric currents were obtained; but when\r\nthese were tested by inverting the direction of contact, and in other ways,\r\nthey were found to be due to other causes than the one sought for. A little\r\ndifference in temperature; a minute portion of the nitrate of mercury used\r\nto amalgamate the wires, entering into the water employed to reduce the two\r\ncups of mercury to the same temperature; was sufficient to produce currents\r\nof electricity, which affected the galvanometer, notwithstanding they had\r\nto pass through nearly five hundred feet of water. When these and other\r\ninterfering causes were guarded against, no effect was obtained; and it\r\nappeared that even such dissimilar substances as water and copper, when\r\ncutting the magnetic curves of the earth with equal velocity, perfectly\r\nneutralized each other's action.\r\n\r\n187. Mr. Fox of Falmouth has obtained some highly important results\r\nrespecting the electricity of metalliferous veins in the mines of Cornwall,\r\nwhich have been published in the Philosophical Transactions[A]. I have\r\nexamined the paper with a view to ascertain whether any of the effects were\r\nprobably referable to magneto-electric induction; but, though unable to\r\nform a very strong opinion, believe they are not. When parallel veins\r\nrunning east and west were compared, the general tendency of the\r\nelectricity _in the wires_ was from north to south; when the comparison was\r\nmade between parts towards the surface and at some depth, the current of\r\nelectricity in the wires was from above downwards. If there should be any\r\nnatural difference in the force of the electric currents produced by\r\nmagneto-electric induction in different substances, or substances in\r\ndifferent positions moving with the earth, and which might be rendered\r\nevident by increasing the masses acted upon, then the wires and veins\r\nexperimented with by Mr. Fox might perhaps have acted as dischargers to the\r\nelectricity of the mass of strata included between them, and the directions\r\nof the currents would agree with those observed as above.\r\n\r\n  [A] 1830. p. 399.\r\n\r\n188. Although the electricity obtained by magneto-electric induction in a\r\nfew feet of wire is of but small intensity, and has not yet been observed\r\nexcept in metals, and carbon in a particular state, still it has power to\r\npass through brine (23.); and, as increased length in the substance acted\r\nupon produces increase of intensity, I hoped to obtain effects from\r\nextensive moving masses of water, though quiescent water gave none. I made\r\nexperiments therefore (by favour) at Waterloo Bridge, extending a copper\r\nwire nine hundred and sixty feet in length upon the parapet of the bridge,\r\nand dropping from its extremities other wires with extensive plates of\r\nmetal attached to them to complete contact with the water. Thus the wire\r\nand the water made one conducting circuit; and as the water ebbed or flowed\r\nwith the tide, I hoped to obtain currents analogous to those of the brass\r\nball (161.).\r\n\r\n189. I constantly obtained deflections at the galvanometer, but they were\r\nvery irregular, and were, in succession, referred to other causes than that\r\nsought for. The different condition of the water as to purity on the two\r\nsides of the river; the difference in temperature; slight differences in\r\nthe plates, in the solder used, in the more or less perfect contact made by\r\ntwisting or otherwise; all produced effects in turn: and though I\r\nexperimented on the water passing through the middle arches only; used\r\nplatina plates instead of copper; and took every other precaution, I could\r\nnot after three days obtain any satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n190. Theoretically, it seems a necessary consequence, that where water is\r\nflowing, there electric currents should be formed; thus, if a line be\r\nimagined passing from Dover to Calais through the sea, and returning\r\nthrough the land beneath the water to Dover, it traces out a circuit of\r\nconducting matter, one part of which, when the water moves up or down the\r\nchannel, is cutting the magnetic curves of the earth, whilst the other is\r\nrelatively at rest. This is a repetition of the wire experiment (171.), but\r\nwith worse conductors. Still there is every reason to believe that electric\r\ncurrents do run in the general direction of the circuit described, either\r\none way or the other, according as the passage of the waters is up or down\r\nthe channel. Where the lateral extent of the moving water is enormously\r\nincreased, it does not seem improbable that the effect should become\r\nsensible; and the gulf stream may thus, perhaps, from electric currents\r\nmoving across it, by magneto-electric induction from the earth, exert a\r\nsensible influence upon the forms of the lines of magnetic variation[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Theoretically, even a ship or a boat when passing on the surface\r\n  of the water, in northern or southern latitudes, should have currents\r\n  of electricity running through it directly across the line of her\r\n  motion; or if the water is flowing past the ship at anchor, similar\r\n  currents should occur.\r\n\r\n191. Though positive results have not yet been obtained by the action of\r\nthe earth upon water and aqueous fluids, yet, as the experiments are very\r\nlimited in their extent, and as such fluids do yield the current by\r\nartificial magnets (23.), (for transference of the current is proof that it\r\nmay be produced (213.),) the supposition made, that the earth produces\r\nthese induced currents within itself (181.) in consequence of its diurnal\r\nrotation, is still highly probable (222, 223.); and when it is considered\r\nthat the moving masses extend for thousands of miles across the magnetic\r\ncurves, cutting them in various directions within its mass, as well as at\r\nthe surface, it is possible the electricity may rise to considerable\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n192. I hardly dare venture, even in the most hypothetical form, to ask\r\nwhether the Aurora Borealis and Australia may not be the discharge of\r\nelectricity, thus urged towards the poles of the earth, from whence it is\r\nendeavouring to return by natural and appointed means above the earth to\r\nthe equatorial regions. The non-occurrence of it in very high latitudes is\r\nnot at all against the supposition; and it is remarkable that Mr. Fox, who\r\nobserved the deflections of the magnetic needle at Falmouth, by the Aurora\r\nBorealis, gives that direction of it which perfectly agrees with the\r\npresent view. He states that all the variations at night were towards the\r\neast[A], and this is what would happen if electric currents were setting\r\nfrom south to north in the earth under the needle, or from north to south\r\nin space above it.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1831, p. 202.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _General remarks and illustrations of the Force and Direction of\r\nMagneto-electric Induction._\r\n\r\n\r\n193. In the repetition and variation of Arago's experiment by Messrs.\r\nBabbage, Herschel, and Harris, these philosophers directed their attention\r\nto the differences of force observed amongst the metals and other\r\nsubstances in their action on the magnet. These differences were very\r\ngreat[A], and led me to hope that by mechanical combinations of various\r\nmetals important results might be obtained (183.). The following\r\nexperiments were therefore made, with a view to obtain, if possible, any\r\nsuch difference of the action of two metals,\r\n\r\n  [B] Philosophical Transactions, 1825, p. 472; 1831, p.78.\r\n\r\n194. A piece of soft iron bonnet-wire covered with cotton was laid bare and\r\ncleaned at one extremity, and there fastened by metallic contact with the\r\nclean end of a copper wire. Both wires were then twisted together like the\r\nstrands of a rope, for eighteen or twenty inches; and the remaining parts\r\nbeing made to diverge, their extremities were connected with the wires of\r\nthe galvanometer. The iron wire was about two feet long, the continuation\r\nto the galvanometer being copper.\r\n\r\n195. The twisted copper and iron (touching each other nowhere but at the\r\nextremity) were then passed between the poles of a powerful magnet arranged\r\nhorse-shoe fashion (fig. 32.); but not the slightest effect was observed at\r\nthe galvanometer, although the arrangement seemed fitted to show any\r\nelectrical difference between the two metals relative to the action of the\r\nmagnet,\r\n\r\n196. A soft iron cylinder was then covered with paper at the middle part,\r\nand the twisted portion of the above compound wire coiled as a spiral\r\naround it, the connexion with the galvanometer still being made at the ends\r\nA and B. The iron cylinder was then brought in contact with the poles of a\r\npowerful magnet capable of raising thirty pounds; yet no signs of\r\nelectricity appeared at the galvanometer. Every precaution was applied in\r\nmaking and breaking contact to accumulate effect, but no indications of a\r\ncurrent could be obtained.\r\n\r\n197. Copper and tin, copper and zinc, tin and zinc, tin and iron, and zinc\r\nand iron, were tried against each other in a similar manner (194), but not\r\nthe slightest sign of electric currents could be procured.\r\n\r\n198. Two flat spirals, one of copper and the other of iron, containing each\r\neighteen inches of wire, were connected with each other and with the\r\ngalvanometer, and then put face to face so as to be in contrary directions.\r\nWhen brought up to the magnetic pole (53.). No electrical indications at\r\nthe galvanometer were observed. When one was turned round so that both were\r\nin the same direction, the effect at the galvanometer was very powerful.\r\n\r\n199. The compound helix of copper and iron wire formerly described (8.) was\r\narranged as a double helix, one of the helices being all iron and\r\ncontaining two hundred and fourteen feet, the other all copper and\r\ncontinuing two hundred and eight feet. The two similar ends AA of the\r\ncopper and iron helix were connected together, and the other ends BB of\r\neach helix connected with the galvanometer; so that when a magnet was\r\nintroduced into the centre of the arrangement, the induced currents in the\r\niron and copper would tend to proceed in contrary directions. Yet when a\r\nmagnet was inserted, or a soft iron bar within made a magnet by contact\r\nwith poles, no effect at the needle was produced.\r\n\r\n200. A glass tube about fourteen inches long was filled with strong\r\nsulphuric acid. Twelve inches of the end of a clean copper wire were bent\r\nup into a bundle and inserted into the tube, so as to make good superficial\r\ncontact with the acid, and the rest of the wire passed along the outside of\r\nthe tube and away to the galvanometer. A wire similarly bent up at the\r\nextremity was immersed in the other end of the sulphuric acid, and also\r\nconnected with the galvanometer, so that the acid and copper wire were in\r\nthe same parallel relation to each other in this experiment as iron and\r\ncopper were in the first (194). When this arrangement was passed in a\r\nsimilar manner between the poles of the magnet, not the slightest effect at\r\nthe galvanometer could be perceived.\r\n\r\n201. From these experiments it would appear, that when metals of different\r\nkinds connected in one circuit are equally subject in every circumstance to\r\nmagneto-electric induction, they exhibit exactly equal powers with respect\r\nto the currents which either are formed, or tend to form, in them. The same\r\neven appears to be the case with regard to fluids, and probably all other\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n202. Still it seemed impossible that these results could indicate the\r\nrelative inductive power of the magnet upon the different metals; for that\r\nthe effect should be in some relation to the conducting power seemed a\r\nnecessary consequence (139.), and the influence of rotating plates upon\r\nmagnets had been found to bear a general relation to the conducting power\r\nof the substance used.\r\n\r\n203. In the experiments of rotation (81.), the electric current is excited\r\nand discharged in the same substance, be it a good or bad conductor; but in\r\nthe experiments just described the current excited in iron could not be\r\ntransmitted but through the copper, and that excited in copper had to pass\r\nthrough iron: i.e. supposing currents of dissimilar strength to be formed\r\nin the metals proportionate to their conducting power, the stronger current\r\nhad to pass through the worst conductor, and the weaker current through the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n204. Experiments were therefore made in which different metals insulated\r\nfrom each other were passed between the poles of the magnet, their opposite\r\nends being connected with the same end of the galvanometer wire, so that\r\nthe currents formed and led away to the galvanometer should oppose each\r\nother; and when considerable lengths of different wires were used, feeble\r\ndeflections were obtained.\r\n\r\n205. To obtain perfectly satisfactory results a new galvanometer was\r\nconstructed, consisting of two independent coils, each containing eighteen\r\nfeet of silked copper wire. These coils were exactly alike in shape and\r\nnumber of turns, and were fixed side by side with a small interval between\r\nthem, in which a double needle could be hung by a fibre of silk exactly as\r\nin the former instrument (87.). The coils may be distinguished by the\r\nletters KL, and when electrical currents were sent through them in the same\r\ndirection, acted upon the needle with the sum of their powers; when in\r\nopposite directions, with the difference of their powers.\r\n\r\n206. The compound helix (199. 8.) was now connected, the ends A and B of\r\nthe iron with A and B ends of galvanometer coil K, and the ends A and B of\r\nthe copper with B and A ends of galvanometer coil L, so that the currents\r\nexcited in the two helices should pass in opposite directions through the\r\ncoils K and L. On introducing a small cylinder magnet within the helices,\r\nthe galvanometer needle was powerfully deflected. On disuniting the iron\r\nhelix, the magnet caused with the copper helix alone still stronger\r\ndeflection in the same direction. On reuniting the iron helix, and\r\nunconnecting the copper helix, the magnet caused a moderate deflection in\r\nthe contrary direction. Thus it was evident that the electric current\r\ninduced by a magnet in a copper wire was far more powerful than the current\r\ninduced by the same magnet in an equal iron wire.\r\n\r\n207. To prevent any error that might arise from the greater influence, from\r\nvicinity or other circumstances, of one coil on the needle beyond that of\r\nthe other, the iron and copper terminations were changed relative to the\r\ngalvanometer coils KL, so that the one which before carried the current\r\nfrom the copper now conveyed that from the iron, and vice versa. But the\r\nsame striking superiority of the copper was manifested as before. This\r\nprecaution was taken in the rest of the experiments with other metals to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n208. I then had wires of iron, zinc, copper, tin, and lead, drawn to the\r\nsame diameter (very nearly one twentieth of an inch), and I compared\r\nexactly equal lengths, namely sixteen feet, of each in pairs in the\r\nfollowing manner: The ends of the copper wire were connected with the ends\r\nA and B of galvanometer coil K, and the ends of the zinc wire with the\r\nterminations A and B of the galvanometer coil L. The middle part of each\r\nwire was then coiled six times round a cylinder of soft iron covered with\r\npaper, long enough to connect the poles of Daniell's horse-shoe magnet\r\n(56.) (fig. 33.), so that similar helices of copper and zinc, each of six\r\nturns, surrounded the bar at two places equidistant from each other and\r\nfrom the poles of the magnet; but these helices were purposely arranged so\r\nas to be in contrary directions, and therefore send contrary currents\r\nthrough the galvanometer coils K and L,\r\n\r\n209. On making and breaking contact between the soft iron bar and the poles\r\nof the magnet, the galvanometer was strongly affected; on detaching the\r\nzinc it was still more strongly affected in the same direction. On taking\r\nall the precautions before alluded to (207.), with others, it was\r\nabundantly proved that the current induced by the magnet in copper was far\r\nmore powerful than in zinc.\r\n\r\n210. The copper was then compared in a similar manner with tin, lead, and\r\niron, and surpassed them all, even more than it did zinc. The zinc was then\r\ncompared experimentally with the tin, lead, and iron, and found to produce\r\na more powerful current than any of them. Iron in the same manner proved\r\nsuperior to tin and lead. Tin came next, and lead the last.\r\n\r\n211. Thus the order of these metals is copper, zinc, iron, tin, and lead.\r\nIt is exactly their order with respect to conducting power for electricity,\r\nand, with the exception of iron, is the order presented by the\r\nmagneto-rotation experiments of Messrs. Babbage, Herschel, Harris, &c. The\r\niron has additional power in the latter kind of experiments, because of its\r\nordinary magnetic relations, and its place relative to magneto-electric\r\naction of the kind now under investigation cannot be ascertained by such\r\ntrials. In the manner above described it may be correctly ascertained[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Mr. Christie, who being appointed reporter upon this paper, had it\r\n  in his hands before it was complete, felt the difficulty (202.); and\r\n  to satisfy his mind, made experiments upon iron and copper with the\r\n  large magnet(44.), and came to the same conclusions as I have arrived\r\n  at. The two sets of experiments were perfectly independent of each\r\n  other, neither of us being aware of the other's proceedings.\r\n\r\n212. It must still be observed that in these experiments the whole effect\r\nbetween different metals is not obtained; for of the thirty-four feet of\r\nwire included in each circuit, eighteen feet are copper in both, being the\r\nwire of the galvanometer coils; and as the whole circuit is concerned in\r\nthe resulting force of the current, tin's circumstance must tend to\r\ndiminish the difference which would appear between the metals if the\r\ncircuits were of the same substances throughout. In the present case the\r\ndifference obtained is probably not more than a half of that which would be\r\ngiven if the whole of each circuit were of one metal.\r\n\r\n213. These results tend to prove that the currents produced by\r\nmagneto-electric induction in bodies is proportional to their conducting\r\npower. That they are _exactly_ proportional to and altogether dependent\r\nupon the conducting power, is, I think, proved by the perfect neutrality\r\ndisplayed when two metals or other substances, as acid, water, &c. &c.\r\n(201. 186.), are opposed to each other in their action. The feeble current\r\nwhich tends to be produced in the worse conductor, has its transmission\r\nfavoured in the better conductor, and the stronger current which tends to\r\nform in the latter has its intensity diminished by the obstruction of the\r\nformer; and the forces of generation and obstruction are so perfectly\r\nneutralize each other exactly. Now as the obstruction is inversely as the\r\nbalanced as to conducting power, the tendency to generate a current must\r\nbe directly as that power to produce this perfect equilibrium.\r\n\r\n214. The cause of the equality of action under the various circumstances\r\ndescribed, where great extent of wire (183.) or wire and water (181.) were\r\nconnected together, which yet produced such different effects upon the\r\nmagnet, is now evident and simple.\r\n\r\n215. The effects of a rotating substance upon a needle or magnet ought,\r\nwhere ordinary magnetism has no influence, to be directly as the conducting\r\npower of the substance; and I venture now to predict that such will be\r\nfound to be the case; and that in all those instances where non-conductors\r\nhave been supposed to exhibit this peculiar influence, the motion has been\r\ndue to some interfering cause of an ordinary kind; as mechanical\r\ncommunication of motion through the parts of the apparatus, or otherwise\r\n(as in the case Mr. Harris has pointed out[A]); or else to ordinary\r\nmagnetic attractions. To distinguish the effects of the latter from those\r\nof the induced electric currents, I have been able to devise a most perfect\r\ntest, which shall be almost immediately described (243.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1831. p. 68.\r\n\r\n216. There is every reason to believe that the magnet or magnetic needle\r\nwill become an excellent measurer of the conducting power of substances\r\nrotated near it; for I have found by careful experiment, that when a\r\nconstant current of electricity was sent successively through a series of\r\nwires of copper, platina, zinc, silver, lead, and tin, drawn to the same\r\ndiameter; the deflection of the needle was exactly equal by them all. It\r\nmust be remembered that when bodies are rotated in a horizontal plane, the\r\nmagnetism of the earth is active upon them. As the effect is general to the\r\nwhole of the plate, it may not interfere in these cases; but in some\r\nexperiments and calculations may be of important consequence.\r\n\r\n217. Another point which I endeavoured to ascertain, was, whether it was\r\nessential or not that the moving part of the wire should, in cutting the\r\nmagnetic curves, pass into positions of greater or lesser magnetic force;\r\nor whether, always intersecting curves of equal magnetic intensity, the\r\nmere motion was sufficient for the production of the current. That the\r\nlatter is true, has been proved already in several of the experiments on\r\nterrestrial magneto-electric induction. Thus the electricity evolved from\r\nthe copper plate (149.), the currents produced in the rotating globe (161,\r\n&c.), and those passing through the moving wire (171.), are all produced\r\nunder circumstances in which the magnetic force could not but be the same\r\nduring the whole experiments.\r\n\r\n218. To prove the point with an ordinary magnet, a copper disc was cemented\r\nupon the end of a cylinder magnet, with paper intervening; the magnet and\r\ndisc were rotated together, and collectors (attached to the galvanometer)\r\nbrought in contact with the circumference and the central part of the\r\ncopper plate. The galvanometer needle moved as in former cases, and the\r\n_direction_ of motion was the _same_ as that which would have resulted, if\r\nthe copper only had revolved, and the magnet been fixed. Neither was there\r\nany apparent difference in the quantity of deflection. Hence, rotating the\r\nmagnet causes no difference in the results; for a rotatory and a stationary\r\nmagnet produce the same effect upon the moving copper.\r\n\r\n219. A copper cylinder, closed at one extremity, was then put over the\r\nmagnet, one half of which it inclosed like a cap; it was firmly fixed, and\r\nprevented from touching the magnet anywhere by interposed paper. The\r\narrangement was then floated in a narrow jar of mercury, so that the lower\r\nedge of the copper cylinder touched the fluid metal; one wire of the\r\ngalvanometer dipped into this mercury, and the other into a little cavity\r\nin the centre of the end of the copper cap. Upon rotating the magnet and\r\nits attached cylinder, abundance of electricity passed through the\r\ngalvanometer, and in the same direction as if the cylinder had rotated\r\nonly, the magnet being still. The results therefore were the same as those\r\nwith the disc (218.).\r\n\r\n220. That the metal of the magnet itself might be substituted for the\r\nmoving cylinder, disc, or wire, seemed an inevitable consequence, and yet\r\none which would exhibit the effects of magneto-electric induction in a\r\nstriking form. A cylinder magnet had therefore a little hole made in the\r\ncentre of each end to receive a drop of mercury, and was then floated pole\r\nupwards in the same metal contained in a narrow jar. One wire from the\r\ngalvanometer dipped into the mercury of the jar, and the other into the\r\ndrop contained in the hole at the upper extremity of the axis. The magnet\r\nwas then revolved by a piece of string passed round it, and the\r\ngalvanometer-needle immediately indicated a powerful current of\r\nelectricity. On reversing the order of rotation, the electrical current was\r\nreversed. The direction of the electricity was the same as if the copper\r\ncylinder (219.) or a copper wire had revolved round the fixed magnet in the\r\nsame direction as that which the magnet itself had followed. Thus a\r\n_singular independence_ of the magnetism and the bar in which it resides is\r\nrendered evident.\r\n\r\n221. In the above experiment the mercury reached about halfway up the\r\nmagnet; but when its quantity was increased until within one eighth of an\r\ninch of the top, or diminished until equally near the bottom, still the\r\nsame effects and the _same direction_ of electrical current was obtained.\r\nBut in those extreme proportions the effects did not appear so strong as\r\nwhen the surface of the mercury was about the middle, or between that and\r\nan inch from each end. The magnet was eight inches and a half long, and\r\nthree quarters of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n222. Upon inversion of the magnet, and causing rotation in the same\r\ndirection, i.e. always screw or always unscrew, then a contrary current of\r\nelectricity was produced. But when the motion of the magnet was continued\r\nin a direction constant in relation to its _own axis_, then electricity of\r\nthe same kind was collected at both poles, and the opposite electricity at\r\nthe equator, or in its neighbourhood, or in the parts corresponding to it.\r\nIf the magnet be held parallel to the axis of the earth, with its unmarked\r\npole directed to the pole star, and then rotated so that the parts at its\r\nsouthern side pass from west to east in conformity to the motion of the\r\nearth; then positive electricity may be collected at the extremities of the\r\nmagnet, and negative electricity at or about the middle of its mass.\r\n\r\n223. When the galvanometer was very sensible, the mere spinning of the\r\nmagnet in the air, whilst one of the galvanometer wires touched the\r\nextremity, and the other the equatorial parts, was sufficient to evolve a\r\ncurrent of electricity and deflect the needle.\r\n\r\n224. Experiments were then made with a similar magnet, for the purpose of\r\nascertaining whether any return of the electric current could occur at the\r\ncentral or axial parts, they having the same angular velocity of rotation\r\nas the other parts (259.) the belief being that it could not.\r\n\r\n225. A cylinder magnet, seven inches in length, and three quarters of an\r\ninch in diameter, had a hole pierced in the direction of its axis from one\r\nextremity, a quarter of an inch in diameter, and three inches deep. A\r\ncopper cylinder, surrounded by paper and amalgamated at both extremities,\r\nwas introduced so as to be in metallic contact at the bottom of the hole,\r\nby a little mercury, with the middle of the magnet; insulated at the sides\r\nby the paper; and projecting about a quarter of an inch above the end of\r\nthe steel. A quill was put over the copper rod, which reached to the paper,\r\nand formed a cup to receive mercury for the completion of the circuit. A\r\nhigh paper edge was also raised round that end of the magnet and mercury\r\nput within it, which however had no metallic connexion with that in the\r\nquill, except through the magnet itself and the copper rod (fig. 34.). The\r\nwires A and B from the galvanometer were dipped into these two portions of\r\nmercury; any current through them could, therefore, only pass down the\r\nmagnet towards its equatorial parts, and then up the copper rod; or vice\r\nversa.\r\n\r\n226. When thus arranged and rotated screw fashion, the marked end of the\r\ngalvanometer needle went west, indicating that there was a current through\r\nthe instrument from A to B and consequently from B through the magnet and\r\ncopper rod to A (fig. 34.).\r\n\r\n227. The magnet was then put into a jar of mercury (fig. 35.) as before\r\n(219.); the wire A left in contact with the copper axis, but the wire B\r\ndipped in the mercury of the jar, and therefore in metallic communication\r\nwith the equatorial parts of the magnet instead of its polar extremity. On\r\nrevolving the magnet screw fashion, the galvanometer needle was deflected\r\nin the same direction as before, but far more powerfully. Yet it is evident\r\nthat the parts of the magnet from the equator to the pole were out of the\r\nelectric circuit.\r\n\r\n228. Then the wire A was connected with the mercury on the extremity of the\r\nmagnet, the wire B still remaining in contact with that in the jar (fig.\r\n36.), so that the copper axis was altogether out of the circuit. The magnet\r\nwas again revolved screw fashion, and again caused the same deflection of\r\nthe needle, the current being as strong as it was in the last trial (227.),\r\nand much stronger than at first (226.).\r\n\r\n229. Hence it is evident that there is no discharge of the current at the\r\ncentre of the magnet, for the current, now freely evolved, is up through\r\nthe magnet; but in the first experiment (226.) it was down. In fact, at\r\nthat time, it was only the part of the moving metal equal to a little disc\r\nextending from the end of the wire B in the mercury to the wire A that was\r\nefficient, i.e. moving with a different angular velocity to the rest of the\r\ncircuit (258.); and for that portion the direction of the current is\r\nconsistent with the other results.\r\n\r\n230. In the two after experiments, the _lateral_ parts of the magnet or of\r\nthe copper rod are those which move relative to the other parts of the\r\ncircuit, i.e. the galvanometer wires; and being more extensive,\r\nintersecting more curves, or moving with more velocity, produce the greater\r\neffect. For the discal part, the direction of the induced electric current\r\nis the same in all, namely, from the circumference towards the centre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n231. The law under which the induced electric current excited in bodies\r\nmoving relatively to magnets, is made dependent on the intersection of the\r\nmagnetic curves by the metal (114.) being thus rendered more precise and\r\ndefinite (217. 220. 224.), seem now even to apply to the cause in the first\r\nsection of the former paper (26.); and by rendering a perfect reason for\r\nthe effects produced, take away any for supposing that peculiar condition,\r\nwhich I ventured to call the electro-tonic state (60.).\r\n\r\n232. When an electrical current is passed through a wire, that wire is\r\nsurrounded at every part by magnetic curves, diminishing in intensity\r\naccording to their distance from the wire, and which in idea may be likened\r\nto rings situated in planes perpendicular to the wire or rather to the\r\nelectric current within it. These curves, although different in form, are\r\nperfectly analogous to those existing between two contrary magnetic poles\r\nopposed to each other; and when a second wire, parallel to that which\r\ncarries the current, is made to approach the latter (18.), it passes\r\nthrough magnetic curves exactly of the same kind as those it would\r\nintersect when carried between opposite magnetic poles (109.) in one\r\ndirection; and as it recedes from the inducing wire, it cuts the curves\r\naround it in the same manner that it would do those between the same poles\r\nif moved in the other direction.\r\n\r\n233. If the wire NP (fig. 40.) have an electric current passed through it\r\nin the direction from P to N, then the dotted ring may represent a magnetic\r\ncurve round it, and it is in such a direction that if small magnetic\r\nneedles lie placed as tangents to it, they will become arranged as in the\r\nfigure, _n_ and _s_ indicating north and south ends (14. _note_.).\r\n\r\n234. But if the current of electricity were made to cease for a while, and\r\nmagnetic poles were used instead to give direction to the needles, and make\r\nthem take the same position as when under the influence of the current,\r\nthen they must be arranged as at fig. 41; the marked and unmarked poles\r\n_ab_ above the wire, being in opposite directions to those _a'b'_ below. In\r\nsuch a position therefore the magnetic curves between the poles _ab_ and\r\n_a'b'_ have the same general direction with the corresponding parts of the\r\nring magnetic curve surrounding the wire NP carrying an electric current.\r\n\r\n235. If the second wire _pn_ (fig. 40.) be now brought towards the\r\nprincipal wire, carrying a current, it will cut an infinity of magnetic\r\ncurves, similar in direction to that figured, and consequently similar in\r\ndirection to those between the poles _ab_ of the magnets (fig. 41.), and it\r\nwill intersect these current curves in the same manner as it would the\r\nmagnet curves, if it passed from above between the poles downwards. Now,\r\nsuch an intersection would, with the magnets, induce an electric current in\r\nthe wire from _p_ to _n_ (114.); and therefore as the curves are alike in\r\narrangement, the same effect ought to result from the intersection of the\r\nmagnetic curves dependent on the current in the wire NP; and such is the\r\ncase, for on approximation the induced current is in the opposite direction\r\nto the principal current (19.).\r\n\r\n236. If the wire _p'n'_ be carried up from below, it will pass in the\r\nopposite direction between the magnetic poles; but then also the magnetic\r\npoles themselves are reversed (fig. 41.), and the induced current is\r\ntherefore (114.) still in the same direction as before. It is also, for\r\nequally sufficient and evident reasons, in the same direction, if produced\r\nby the influence of the curves dependent upon the wire.\r\n\r\n237. When the second wire is retained at rest in the vicinity the principal\r\nwire, no current is induced through it, for it is intersecting no magnetic\r\ncurves. When it is removed from the principal wire, it intersects the\r\ncurves in the opposite direction to what it did before (235.); and a\r\ncurrent in the opposite direction is induced, which therefore corresponds\r\nwith the direction of the principal current (19.). The same effect would\r\ntake place if by inverting the direction of motion of the wire in passing\r\nbetween either set of poles (fig. 41.), it were made to intersect the\r\ncurves there existing in the opposite direction to what it did before.\r\n\r\n238. In the first experiments (10. 13.), the inducing wire and that under\r\ninduction were arranged at a fixed distance from each other, and then an\r\nelectric current sent through the former. In such cases the magnetic curves\r\nthemselves must be considered as moving (if I may use the expression)\r\nacross the wire under induction, from the moment at which they begin to be\r\ndeveloped until the magnetic force of the current is at its utmost;\r\nexpanding as it were from the wire outwards, and consequently being in the\r\nsame relation to the fixed wire under induction as if _it_ had moved in the\r\nopposite direction across them, or towards the wire carrying the current.\r\nHence the first current induced in such cases was in the contrary direction\r\nto the principal current (17. 235.). On breaking the battery contact, the\r\nmagnetic curves (which are mere expressions for arranged magnetic forces)\r\nmay be conceived as contracting upon and returning towards the failing\r\nelectrical current, and therefore move in the opposite direction across the\r\nwire, and cause an opposite induced current to the first.\r\n\r\n239. When, in experiments with ordinary magnets, the latter, in place of\r\nbeing moved past the wires, were actually made near them (27. 36.), then a\r\nsimilar progressive development of the magnetic curves may be considered as\r\nhaving taken place, producing the effects which would have occurred by\r\nmotion of the wires in one direction; the destruction of the magnetic power\r\ncorresponds to the motion of the wire in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n240. If, instead of intersecting the magnetic curves of a straight wire\r\ncarrying a current, by approximating or removing a second wire (235.), a\r\nrevolving plate be used, being placed for that purpose near the wire, and,\r\nas it were, amongst the magnetic curves, then it ought to have continuous\r\nelectric currents induced within it; and if a line joining the wire with\r\nthe centre of the plate were perpendicular to both, then the induced\r\ncurrent ought to be, according to the law (114.), directly across the\r\nplate, from one side to the other, and at right angles to the direction of\r\nthe inducing current.\r\n\r\n241. A single metallic wire one twentieth of an inch in diameter had an\r\nelectric current passed through it, and a small copper disc one inch and a\r\nhalf in diameter revolved near to and under, but not in actual contact with\r\nit (fig. 39). Collectors were then applied at the opposite edges of the\r\ndisc, and wires from them connected with the galvanometer. As the disc\r\nrevolved in one direction, the needle was deflected on one side: and when\r\nthe direction of revolution was reversed, the needle was inclined on the\r\nother side, in accordance with the results anticipated.\r\n\r\n242. Thus the reasons which induce me to suppose a particular state in the\r\nwire (60.) have disappeared; and though it still seems to me unlikely that\r\na wire at rest in the neighbourhood of another carrying a powerful electric\r\ncurrent is entirely indifferent to it, yet I am not aware of any distinct\r\n_facts_ which authorize the conclusion that it is in a particular state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n243. In considering the nature of the cause assigned in these papers to\r\naccount for the mutual influence of magnets and moving metals (120.), and\r\ncomparing it with that heretofore admitted, namely, the induction of a\r\nfeeble magnetism like that produced in iron, it occurred to me that a most\r\ndecisive experimental test of the two views could be applied (215.).\r\n\r\n244. No other known power has like direction with that exerted between an\r\nelectric current and a magnetic pole; it is tangential, while all other\r\nforces, acting at a distance, are direct. Hence, if a magnetic pole on one\r\nside of a revolving plate follow its course by reason of its obedience to\r\nthe tangential force exerted upon it by the very current of electricity\r\nwhich it has itself caused, a similar pole on the opposite side of the\r\nplate should immediately set it free from this force; for the currents\r\nwhich tend to be formed by the action of the two poles are in opposite\r\ndirections; or rather no current tends to be formed, or no magnetic curves\r\nare intersected (114.); and therefore the magnet should remain at rest. On\r\nthe contrary, if the action of a north magnetic pole were to produce a\r\nsouthness in the nearest part of the copper plate, and a diffuse northness\r\nelsewhere (82.), as is really the case with iron; then the use of another\r\nnorth pole on the opposite side of the same part of the plate should double\r\nthe effect instead of destroying it, and double the tendency of the first\r\nmagnet to move with the plate.\r\n\r\n245. A thick copper plate (85.) was therefore fixed on a vertical axis, a\r\nbar magnet was suspended by a plaited silk cord, so that its marked pole\r\nhung over the edge of the plate, and a sheet of paper being interposed, the\r\nplate was revolved; immediately the magnetic pole obeyed its motion and\r\npassed off in the same direction. A second magnet of equal size and\r\nstrength was then attached to the first, so that its marked pole should\r\nhang _beneath_ the edge of the copper plate in a corresponding position to\r\nthat above, and at an equal distance (fig. 37.). Then a paper sheath or\r\nscreen being interposed as before, and the plate revolved, the poles were\r\nfound entirely indifferent to its motion, although either of them alone\r\nwould have followed the course of rotation.\r\n\r\n246. On turning one magnet round, so that _opposite_ poles were on each\r\nside of the plate, then the mutual action of the poles and the moving metal\r\nwas a maximum.\r\n\r\n247. On suspending one magnet so that its axis was level with the plate,\r\nand either pole opposite its edge, the revolution of the plate caused no\r\nmotion of the magnet. The electrical currents dependent upon induction\r\nwould now tend to be produced in a vertical direction across the thickness\r\nof the plate, but could not be so discharged, or at least only to so slight\r\na degree as to leave all effects insensible; but ordinary magnetic\r\ninduction, or that on an iron plate, would be equally if not more\r\npowerfully developed in such a position (251.).\r\n\r\n248. Then, with regard to the production of electricity in these\r\ncases:--whenever motion was communicated by the plate to the magnets,\r\ncurrents existed; when it was not communicated, they ceased. A marked pole\r\nof a large bar magnet was put under the edge of the plate; collectors (86.)\r\napplied at the axis and edge of the plate as on former occasions (fig.\r\n38.), and these connected with the galvanometer; when the plate was\r\nrevolved, abundance of electricity passed to the instrument. The unmarked\r\npole of a similar magnet was then put over the place of the former pole, so\r\nthat contrary poles were above and below; on revolving the plate, the\r\nelectricity was more powerful than before. The latter magnet was then\r\nturned end for end, so that marked poles were both above and below the\r\nplate, and then, upon revolving it, scarcely any electricity was procured.\r\nBy adjusting the distance of the poles so as to correspond with their\r\nrelative force, they at last were brought so perfectly to neutralize each\r\nother's inductive action upon the plate, that no electricity could be\r\nobtained with the most rapid motion.\r\n\r\n249. I now proceeded to compare the effect of similar and dissimilar poles\r\nupon iron and copper, adopting for the purpose Mr. Sturgeon's very useful\r\nform of Arago's experiment. This consists in a circular plate of metal\r\nsupported in a vertical plane by a horizontal axis, and weighted a little\r\nat one edge or rendered excentric so as to vibrate like a pendulum. The\r\npoles of the magnets are applied near the side and edges of these plates,\r\nand then the number of vibrations, required to reduce the vibrating arc a\r\ncertain constant quantity, noted. In the first description of this\r\ninstrument[A] it is said that opposite poles produced the greatest\r\nretarding effect, and similar poles none; and yet within a page of the\r\nplace the effect is considered as of the same kind with that produced in\r\niron.\r\n\r\n  [A] Edin. Phil. Journal, 1825, p. 124.\r\n\r\n250. I had two such plates mounted, one of copper, one of iron. The copper\r\nplate alone gave sixty vibrations, in the average of several experiments,\r\nbefore the arc of vibration was reduced from one constant mark to another.\r\nOn placing opposite magnetic poles near to, and on each side of, the same\r\nplace, the vibrations were reduced to fifteen. On putting similar poles on\r\neach side of it, they rose to fifty; and on placing two pieces of wood of\r\nequal size with the poles equally near, they became fifty-two. So that,\r\nwhen similar poles were used, the magnetic effect was little or none, (the\r\nobstruction being due to the confinement of the air, rather,) whilst with\r\nopposite poles it was the greatest possible. When a pole was presented to\r\nthe edge of the plate, no retardation occurred.\r\n\r\n251. The iron plate alone made thirty-two vibrations, whilst the arc of\r\nvibration diminished a certain quantity. On presenting a magnetic pole to\r\nthe edge of the plate (247.), the vibrations were diminished to eleven; and\r\nwhen the pole was about half an inch from the edge, to five.\r\n\r\n252. When the marked pole was put at the side of the iron plate at a\r\ncertain distance, the number of vibrations was only five. When the marked\r\npole of the second bar was put on the opposite side of the plate at the\r\nsame distance (250.), the vibrations were reduced to two. But when the\r\nsecond pole was an unmarked one, yet occupying exactly the same position,\r\nthe vibrations rose to twenty-two. By removing the stronger of these two\r\nopposite poles a little way from the plate, the vibrations increased to\r\nthirty-one, or nearly the original number. But on removing it _altogether_,\r\nthey fell to between five and six.\r\n\r\n253. Nothing can be more clear, therefore, than that with iron, and bodies\r\nadmitting of ordinary magnetic induction, _opposite_ poles on opposite\r\nsides of the edge of the plate neutralize each other's effect, whilst\r\n_similar_ poles exalt the action; a single pole end on is also sufficient.\r\nBut with copper, and substances not sensible to ordinary magnetic\r\nimpressions, _similar_ poles on opposite sides of the plate neutralize each\r\nother; _opposite_ poles exalt the action; and a single pole at the edge or\r\nend on does nothing.\r\n\r\n254. Nothing can more completely show the thorough independence of the\r\neffects obtained with the metals by Arago, and those due to ordinary\r\nmagnetic forces; and henceforth, therefore, the application of two poles to\r\nvarious moving substances will, if they appear at all magnetically\r\naffected, afford a proof of the nature of that affection. If opposite poles\r\nproduce a greater effect than one pole, the result will be due to electric\r\ncurrents. If similar poles produce more effect than one, then the power is\r\n_not_ electrical; it is not like that active in the metals and carbon when\r\nthey are moving, and in most cases will probably be found to be not even\r\nmagnetical, but the result of irregular causes not anticipated and\r\nconsequently not guarded against.\r\n\r\n255. The result of these investigations tends to show that there are really\r\nbut very few bodies that are magnetic in the manner of iron. I have often\r\nsought for indications of this power in the common metals and other\r\nsubstances; and once in illustration of Arago's objection (82.), and in\r\nhopes of ascertaining the existence of currents in metals by the momentary\r\napproach of a magnet, suspended a disc of copper by a single fibre of silk\r\nin an excellent vacuum, and approximated powerful magnets on the outside of\r\nthe jar, making them approach and recede in unison with a pendulum that\r\nvibrated as the disc would do: but no motion could be obtained; not merely,\r\nno indication of ordinary magnetic powers, but none or _any electric\r\ncurrent_ occasioned in the metal by the approximation and recession of the\r\nmagnet. I therefore venture to arrange substances in three classes as\r\nregards their relation to magnets; first, those which are affected when at\r\nrest, like iron, nickel, &c., being such as possess ordinary magnetic\r\nproperties; then, those which are affected when in motion, being conductors\r\nof electricity in which are produced electric currents by the inductive\r\nforce of the magnet; and, lastly, those which are perfectly indifferent to\r\nthe magnet, whether at rest or in motion.\r\n\r\n256. Although it will require further research, and probably close\r\ninvestigation, both experimental and mathematical, before the exact mode of\r\naction between a magnet and metal moving relatively to each other is\r\nascertained; yet many of the results appear sufficiently clear and simple\r\nto allow of expression in a somewhat general manner.--If a terminated wire\r\nmove so as to cut a magnetic curve, a power is called into action which\r\ntends to urge an electric current through it; but this current cannot be\r\nbrought into existence unless provision be made at the ends of the wire for\r\nits discharge and renewal.\r\n\r\n257. If a second wire move in the same direction as the first, the same\r\npower is exerted upon it, and it is therefore unable to alter the condition\r\nof the first: for there appear to be no natural differences among\r\nsubstances when connected in a series, by which, when moving under the same\r\ncircumstances relative to the magnet, one tends to produce a more powerful\r\nelectric current in the whole circuit than another (201. 214.).\r\n\r\n258. But if the second wire move with a different velocity, or in some\r\nother direction, then variations in the force exerted take place; and if\r\nconnected at their extremities, an electric current passes through them.\r\n\r\n259. Taking, then, a mass of metal or an endless wire, and referring to the\r\npole of the magnet as a centre of action, (which though perhaps not\r\nstrictly correct may be allowed for facility of expression, at present,) if\r\nall parts move in the same direction, and with the same angular velocity,\r\nand through magnetic curves of constant intensity, then no electric\r\ncurrents are produced. This point is easily observed with masses subject to\r\nthe earth's magnetism, and may be proved with regard to small magnets; by\r\nrotating them, and leaving the metallic arrangements stationary, no current\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\n260. If one part of the wire or metal cut the magnetic curves, whilst the\r\nother is stationary, then currents are produced. All the results obtained\r\nwith the galvanometer are more or less of this nature, the galvanometer\r\nextremity being the fixed part. Even those with the wire, galvanometer, and\r\nearth (170.), may be considered so without any error in the result.\r\n\r\n261. If the motion of the metal be in the same direction, but the angular\r\nvelocity of its parts relative to the pole of the magnet different, then\r\ncurrents are produced. This is the case in Arago's experiment, and also in\r\nthe wire subject to the earth's induction (172.), when it was moved from\r\nwest to east.\r\n\r\n262. If the magnet moves not directly to or from the arrangement, but\r\nlaterally, then the case is similar to the last.\r\n\r\n263. If different parts move in opposite directions across the magnetic\r\ncurves, then the effect is a maximum for equal velocities.\r\n\r\n264. All these in fact are variations of one simple condition, namely, that\r\nall parts of the mass shall not move in the same direction across the\r\ncurves, and with the same angular velocity. But they are forms of\r\nexpression which, being retained in the mind, I have found useful when\r\ncomparing the consistency of particular phenomena with general results.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nDecember 21, 1831._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _Identity of Electricities derived from different sources._ § 8.\r\n_Relation by measure of common and voltaic Electricity._\r\n\r\n[Read January 10th and 17th, 1833.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _Identity of Electricities derived from different sources._\r\n\r\n\r\n265. The progress of the electrical researches which I have had the honour\r\nto present to the Royal Society, brought me to a point at which it was\r\nessential for the further prosecution of my inquiries that no doubt should\r\nremain of the identity or distinction of electricities excited by different\r\nmeans. It is perfectly true that Cavendish[A], Wollaston[B], Colladon[C],\r\nand others, have in succession removed some of the greatest objections to\r\nthe acknowledgement of the identity of common, animal and voltaic\r\nelectricity, and I believe that most philosophers consider these\r\nelectricities as really the same. But on the other hand it is also true,\r\nthat the accuracy of Wollaston's experiments has been denied[D]; and also\r\nthat one of them, which really is no proper proof of chemical decomposition\r\nby common electricity (309. 327.), has been that selected by several\r\nexperimenters as the test of chemical action (336. 346.). It is a fact,\r\ntoo, that many philosophers are still drawing distinctions between the\r\nelectricities from different sources; or at least doubting whether their\r\nidentity is proved. Sir Humphry Davy, for instance, in his paper on the\r\nTorpedo[E], thought it probable that animal electricity would be found of a\r\npeculiar kind; and referring to it, to common electricity, voltaic\r\nelectricity and magnetism, has said, \"Distinctions might be established in\r\npursuing the various modifications or properties of electricity in those\r\ndifferent forms, &c.\" Indeed I need only refer to the last volume of the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions to show that the question is by no means\r\nconsidered as settled[F].\r\n\r\n  [A] Phil.

Magnetism, if it be a form of\r\n  electricity, belongs only to perfect conductors; and, in its\r\n  modifications, to a peculiar class of them[1].

Dr. Davy, in making experiments on the\r\n  torpedo, obtains effects the same as those produced by common and\r\n  voltaic electricity, and says that in its magnetic and chemical power\r\n  it does not seem to be essentially peculiar,--p. 274; but he then\r\n  says, p. 275, there are other points of difference; and after\r\n  referring to them, adds, \"How are these differences to be explained?\r\n  Do they admit of explanation similar to that advanced by Mr. Cavendish\r\n  in his theory of the torpedo; or may we suppose, according to the\r\n  analogy of the solar ray, that the electrical power, whether excited\r\n  by the common machine, or by the voltaic battery, or by the torpedo,\r\n  is not a simple power, but a combination of powers, which may occur\r\n  variously associated, and produce all the varieties of electricity\r\n  with which we are acquainted?\"\r\n\r\nAt p. 279 of the same volume of Transactions is Dr. Ritchie's paper,\r\nfrom which the following are extracts: \"Common electricity is diffused\r\nover the surface of the metal;--voltaic electricity exists within the\r\nmetal. Free electricity is conducted over the surface of the thinnest\r\ngold leaf as effectually as over a mass of metal having the same\r\nsurface;--voltaic electricity requires thickness of metal for its\r\nconduction,\" p. 280: and again, \"The supposed analogy between common and\r\nvoltaic electricity, which was so eagerly traced after the invention of\r\nthe pile, completely fails in this case, which was thought to afford the\r\nmost striking resemblance.\" p. 291.\r\n\r\n266. Notwithstanding, therefore, the general impression of the identity of\r\nelectricities, it is evident that the proofs have not been sufficiently\r\nclear and distinct to obtain the assent of all those who were competent to\r\nconsider the subject; and the question seemed to me very much in the\r\ncondition of that which Sir H. Davy solved so beautifully,--namely, whether\r\nvoltaic electricity in all cases merely eliminated, or did not in some\r\nactually produce, the acid and alkali found after its action upon water.\r\nThe same necessity that urged him to decide the doubtful point, which\r\ninterfered with the extension of his views, and destroyed the strictness of\r\nhis reasoning, has obliged me to ascertain the identity or difference of\r\ncommon and voltaic electricity. I have satisfied myself that they are\r\nidentical, and I hope the experiments which I have to offer and the proofs\r\nflowing from them, will be found worthy the attention of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n267. The various phenomena exhibited by electricity may, for the purposes\r\nof comparison, be arranged under two heads; namely, those connected with\r\nelectricity of tension, and those belonging to electricity in motion. This\r\ndistinction is taken at present not as philosophical, but merely as\r\nconvenient. The effect of electricity of tension, at rest, is either\r\nattraction or repulsion at sensible distances. The effects of electricity\r\nin motion or electrical currents may be considered as 1st, Evolution of\r\nheat; 2nd, Magnetism; 3rd, Chemical decomposition; 4th, Physiological\r\nphenomena; 5th, Spark. It will be my object to compare electricities from\r\ndifferent sources, and especially common and voltaic electricities, by\r\ntheir power of producing these effects.\r\n\r\nI. _Voltaic Electricity._\r\n\r\n268. _Tension._--When a voltaic battery of 100 pairs of plates has its\r\nextremities examined by the ordinary electrometer, it is well known that\r\nthey are found positive and negative, the gold leaves at the same extremity\r\nrepelling each other, the gold leaves at different extremities attracting\r\neach other, even when half an inch or more of air intervenes.\r\n\r\n269. That ordinary electricity is discharged by points with facility\r\nthrough air; that it is readily transmitted through highly rarefied air;\r\nand also through heated air, as for instance a flame; is due to its high\r\ntension. I sought, therefore, for similar effects in the discharge of\r\nvoltaic electricity, using as a test of the passage of the electricity\r\neither the galvanometer or chemical action produced by the arrangement\r\nhereafter to be described (312. 316.).\r\n\r\n270. The voltaic battery I had at my disposal consisted of 140 pairs of\r\nplates four inches square, with double coppers. It was insulated\r\nthroughout, and diverged a gold leaf electrometer about one third of an\r\ninch. On endeavouring to discharge this battery by delicate points very\r\nnicely arranged and approximated, either in the air or in an exhausted\r\nreceiver, I could obtain no indications of a current, either by magnetic or\r\nchemical action. In this, however, was found no point of discordance\r\nbetween voltaic and common electricity; for when a Leyden battery (291.)\r\nwas charged so as to deflect the gold leaf electrometer to the same degree,\r\nthe points were found equally unable to discharge it with such effect as to\r\nproduce either magnetic or chemical action. This was not because common\r\nelectricity could not produce both these effects (307. 310.); but because\r\nwhen of such low intensity the quantity required to make the effects\r\nvisible (being enormously great (371. 375.),) could not be transmitted in\r\nany reasonable time. In conjunction with the other proofs of identity\r\nhereafter to be given, these effects of points also prove identity instead\r\nof difference between voltaic and common electricity.\r\n\r\n271. As heated air discharges common electricity with far greater facility\r\nthan points, I hoped that voltaic electricity might in this way also be\r\ndischarged. An apparatus was therefore constructed (Plate III. fig. 46.),\r\nin which AB is an insulated glass rod upon which two copper wires, C, D,\r\nare fixed firmly; to these wires are soldered two pieces of fine platina\r\nwire, the ends of which are brought very close to each other at _e_, but\r\nwithout touching; the copper wire C was connected with the positive pole of\r\na voltaic battery, and the wire D with a decomposing apparatus (312. 316.),\r\nfrom which the communication was completed to the negative pole of the\r\nbattery. In these experiments only two troughs, or twenty pairs of plates,\r\nwere used.\r\n\r\n272. Whilst in the state described, no decomposition took place at the\r\npoint _a_, but when the side of a spirit-lamp flame was applied to the two\r\nplatina extremities at _e_, so as to make them bright red-hot,\r\ndecomposition occurred; iodine soon appeared at the point _a_, and the\r\ntransference of electricity through the heated air was established. On\r\nraising the temperature of the points _e_ by a blowpipe, the discharge was\r\nrendered still more free, and decomposition took place instantly. On\r\nremoving the source of heat, the current immediately ceased. On putting the\r\nends of the wires very close by the side of and parallel to each other, but\r\nnot touching, the effects were perhaps more readily obtained than before.\r\nOn using a larger voltaic battery (270.), they were also more freely\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n273. On removing the decomposing apparatus and interposing a galvanometer\r\ninstead, heating the points _e_ as the needle would swing one way, and\r\nremoving the heat during the time of its return (302.), feeble deflections\r\nwere soon obtained: thus also proving the current through heated air; but\r\nthe instrument used was not so sensible under the circumstances as chemical\r\naction.\r\n\r\n274. These effects, not hitherto known or expected under this form, are\r\nonly cases of the discharge which takes place through air between the\r\ncharcoal terminations of the poles of a powerful battery, when they are\r\ngradually separated after contact. Then the passage is through heated air\r\nexactly as with common electricity, and Sir H. Davy has recorded that with\r\nthe original battery of the Royal Institution this discharge passed through\r\na space of at least four inches[A]. In the exhausted receiver the\r\nelectricity would _strike_ through nearly half an inch of space, and the\r\ncombined effects of rarefaction and heat were such upon the inclosed air us\r\nto enable it to conduct the electricity through a space of six or seven\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n  [A] Elements of Chemical Philosophy, p. 153\r\n\r\n275. The instantaneous charge of a Leyden battery by the poles of a voltaic\r\napparatus is another proof of the tension, and also the quantity, of\r\nelectricity evolved by the latter. Sir H. Davy says[A], \"When the two\r\nconductors from the ends of the combination were connected with a Leyden\r\nbattery, one with the internal, the other with the external coating, the\r\nbattery instantly became charged; and on removing the wires and making the\r\nproper connexions, either a shock or a _spark_ could be perceived: and the\r\nleast possible time of contact was sufficient to renew the charge to its\r\nfull intensity.\"\r\n\r\n  [A] Elements of Chemical Philosophy, p. 154.\r\n\r\n276. _In motion:_ i. _Evolution of Heat._--The evolution of heat in wires\r\nand fluids by the voltaic current is matter of general notoriety.\r\n\r\n277. ii. _Magnetism._--No fact is better known to philosophers than the\r\npower of the voltaic current to deflect the magnetic needle, and to make\r\nmagnets according to _certain laws_; and no effect can be more distinctive\r\nof an electrical current.\r\n\r\n278. iii. _Chemical decomposition._--The chemical powers of the voltaic\r\ncurrent, and their subjection to _certain laws_, are also perfectly well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n279. iv. _Physiological effects._--The power of the voltaic current, when\r\nstrong, to shock and convulse the whole animal system, and when weak to\r\naffect the tongue and the eyes, is very characteristic.\r\n\r\n280. v. _Spark_.--The brilliant star of light produced by the discharge of\r\na voltaic battery is known to all as the most beautiful light that man can\r\nproduce by art.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n281. That these effects may be almost infinitely varied, some being exalted\r\nwhilst others are diminished, is universally acknowledged; and yet without\r\nany doubt of the identity of character of the voltaic currents thus made to\r\ndiffer in their effect. The beautiful explication of these variations\r\nafforded by Cavendish's theory of quantity and intensity requires no\r\nsupport at present, as it is not supposed to be doubted.\r\n\r\n282. In consequence of the comparisons that will hereafter arise between\r\nwires carrying voltaic and ordinary electricities, and also because of\r\ncertain views of the condition of a wire or any other conducting substance\r\nconnecting the poles of a voltaic apparatus, it will be necessary to give\r\nsome definite expression of what is called the voltaic current, in\r\ncontradistinction to any supposed peculiar state of arrangement, not\r\nprogressive, which the wire or the electricity within it may be supposed to\r\nassume. If two voltaic troughs PN, P'N', fig. 42, be symmetrically arranged\r\nand insulated, and the ends NP' connected by a wire, over which a magnetic\r\nneedle is suspended, the wire will exert no effect over the needle; but\r\nimmediately that the ends PN' are connected by another wire, the needle\r\nwill be deflected, and will remain so as long as the circuit is complete.\r\nNow if the troughs merely act by causing a peculiar arrangement in the wire\r\neither of its particles or its electricity, that arrangement constituting\r\nits electrical and magnetic state, then the wire NP' should be in a similar\r\nstate of arrangement _before_ P and N' were connected, to what it is\r\nafterwards, and should have deflected the needle, although less powerfully,\r\nperhaps to one half the extent which would result when the communication is\r\ncomplete throughout. But if the magnetic effects depend upon a current,\r\nthen it is evident why they could not be produced in _any_ degree before\r\nthe circuit was complete; because prior to that no current could exist.\r\n\r\n283. By _current_, I mean anything progressive, whether it be a fluid of\r\nelectricity, or two fluids moving in opposite directions, or merely\r\nvibrations, or, speaking still more generally, progressive forces. By\r\n_arrangement_, I understand a local adjustment of particles, or fluids, or\r\nforces, not progressive. Many other reasons might be urged in support of\r\nthe view of a _current_ rather than an _arrangement_, but I am anxious to\r\navoid stating unnecessarily what will occur to others at the moment.\r\n\r\nII. _Ordinary Electricity._\r\n\r\n284. By ordinary electricity I understand that which can be obtained from\r\nthe common machine, or from the atmosphere, or by pressure, or cleavage of\r\ncrystals, or by a multitude of other operations; its distinctive character\r\nbeing that of great intensity, and the exertion of attractive and repulsive\r\npowers, not merely at sensible but at considerable distances.\r\n\r\n285. _Tension._ The attractions and repulsions at sensible distances,\r\ncaused by ordinary electricity, are well known to be so powerful in certain\r\ncases, as to surpass, almost infinitely, the similar phenomena produced by\r\nelectricity, otherwise excited. But still those attractions and repulsions\r\nare exactly of the same nature as those already referred to under the head\r\n_Tension, Voltaic electricity_ (268.); and the difference in degree between\r\nthem is not greater than often occurs between cases of ordinary electricity\r\nonly. I think it will be unnecessary to enter minutely into the proofs of\r\nthe identity of this character in the two instances. They are abundant; are\r\ngenerally admitted as good; and lie upon the surface of the subject: and\r\nwhenever in other parts of the comparison I am about to draw, a similar\r\ncase occurs, I shall content myself with a mere announcement of the\r\nsimilarity, enlarging only upon those parts where the great question of\r\ndistinction or identity still exists.\r\n\r\n286. The discharge of common electricity through heated air is a well-known\r\nfact. The parallel case of voltaic electricity has already been described\r\n(272, &c.).\r\n\r\n287. _In motion._ i. _Evolution of heat._--The heating power of common\r\nelectricity, when passed through wires or other substances, is perfectly\r\nwell known. The accordance between it and voltaic electricity is in this\r\nrespect complete. Mr. Harris has constructed and described[A] a very\r\nbeautiful and sensible instrument on this principle, in which the heat\r\nproduced in a wire by the discharge of a small portion of common\r\nelectricity is readily shown, and to which I shall have occasion to refer\r\nfor experimental proof in a future part of this paper (344.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1827, p. 18. Edinburgh Transactions,\r\n  1831. Harris on a New Electrometer, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n288. ii. _Magnetism._--Voltaic electricity has most extraordinary and\r\nexalted magnetic powers. If common electricity be identical with it, it\r\nought to have the same powers. In rendering needles or bars magnetic, it is\r\nfound to agree with voltaic electricity, and the _direction_ of the\r\nmagnetism, in both cases, is the same; but in deflecting the magnetic\r\nneedle, common electricity has been found deficient, so that sometimes its\r\npower has been denied altogether, and at other times distinctions have been\r\nhypothetically assumed for the purpose of avoiding the difficulty[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Demonferrand's Manuel d'Electricité dynamique, p. 121.\r\n\r\n289. M. Colladon, of Geneva, considered that the difference might be due to\r\nthe use of insufficient quantities of common electricity in all the\r\nexperiments before made on this head; and in a memoir read to the Academie\r\ndes Sciences in 1826[A], describes experiments, in which, by the use of a\r\nbattery, points, and a delicate galvanometer, he succeeded in obtaining\r\ndeflections, and thus establishing identity in that respect. MM. Arago,\r\nAmpère, and Savary, are mentioned in the paper as having witnessed a\r\nsuccessful repetition of the experiments. But as no other one has come\r\nforward in confirmation, MM. Arago, Ampère, and Savary, not having\r\nthemselves published (that I am aware of) their admission of the results,\r\nand as some have not been able to obtain them, M. Colladon's conclusions\r\nhave been occasionally doubted or denied; and an important point with me\r\nwas to establish their accuracy, or remove them entirely from the body of\r\nreceived experimental research. I am happy to say that my results fully\r\nconfirm those by M. Colladon, and I should have had no occasion to describe\r\nthem, but that they are essential as proofs of the accuracy of the final\r\nand general conclusions I am enabled to draw respecting the magnetic and\r\nchemical action of electricity (360. 366. 367. 377. &c.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, xxxiii. p. 62.\r\n\r\n290. The plate electrical machine I have used is fifty inches in diameter;\r\nit has two sets of rubbers; its prime conductor consists of two brass\r\ncylinders connected by a third, the whole length being twelve feet, and the\r\nsurface in contact with air about 1422 square inches. When in good\r\nexcitation, one revolution of the plate will give ten or twelve sparks from\r\nthe conductors, each an inch in length. Sparks or flashes from ten to\r\nfourteen inches in length may easily be drawn from the conductors. Each\r\nturn of the machine, when worked moderately, occupies about 4/5ths of a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n291. The electric battery consisted of fifteen equal jars. They are coated\r\neight inches upwards from the bottom, and are twenty-three inches in\r\ncircumference, so that each contains one hundred and eighty-four square\r\ninches of glass, coated on both sides; this is independent of the bottoms,\r\nwhich are of thicker glass, and contain each about fifty square inches.\r\n\r\n292. A good _discharging train_ was arranged by connecting metallically a\r\nsufficiently thick wire with the metallic gas pipes of the house, with the\r\nmetallic gas pipes belonging to the public gas works of London; and also\r\nwith the metallic water pipes of London. It was so effectual in its office\r\nas to carry off instantaneously electricity of the feeblest tension, even\r\nthat of a single voltaic trough, and was essential to many of the\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n293. The galvanometer was one or the other of those formerly described (87.\r\n205.), but the glass jar covering it and supporting the needle was coated\r\ninside and outside with tinfoil, and the upper part (left uncoated, that\r\nthe motions of the needle might be examined,) was covered with a frame of\r\nwire-work, having numerous sharp points projecting from it. When this frame\r\nand the two coatings were connected with the discharging train (292.), an\r\ninsulated point or ball, connected with the machine when most active, might\r\nbe brought within an inch of any part of the galvanometer, yet without\r\naffecting the needle within by ordinary electrical attraction or repulsion.\r\n\r\n294. In connexion with these precautions, it may be necessary to state that\r\nthe needle of the galvanometer is very liable to have its magnetic power\r\nderanged, diminished, or even inverted by the passage of a shock through\r\nthe instrument. If the needle be at all oblique, in the wrong direction, to\r\nthe coils of the galvanometer when the shock passes, effects of this kind\r\nare sure to happen.\r\n\r\n295. It was to the retarding power of bad conductors, with the intention of\r\ndiminishing its _intensity_ without altering its _quantity_, that I first\r\nlooked with the hope of being able to make common electricity assume more\r\nof the characters and power of voltaic electricity, than it is usually\r\nsupposed to have.\r\n\r\n296, The coating and armour of the galvanometer were first connected with\r\nthe discharging train (292.); the end B (87.) of the galvanometer wire was\r\nconnected with the outside coating of the battery, and then both these with\r\nthe discharging train; the end A of the galvanometer wire was connected\r\nwith a discharging rod by a wet thread four feet long; and finally, when\r\nthe battery (291.) had been positively charged by about forty turns of the\r\nmachine, it was discharged by the rod and the thread through the\r\ngalvanometer. The needle immediately moved.\r\n\r\n297. During the time that the needle completed its vibration in the first\r\ndirection and returned, the machine was worked, and the battery recharged;\r\nand when the needle in vibrating resumed its first direction, the discharge\r\nwas again made through the galvanometer. By repeating this action a few\r\ntimes, the vibrations soon extended to above 40° on each side of the line\r\nof rest.\r\n\r\n298. This effect could be obtained at pleasure. Nor was it varied,\r\napparently, either in direction or degree, by using a short thick string,\r\nor even four short thick strings in place of the long fine thread. With a\r\nmore delicate galvanometer, an excellent swing of the needle could be\r\nobtained by one discharge of the battery.\r\n\r\n299. On reversing the galvanometer communications so as to pass the\r\ndischarge through from B to A, the needle was equally well deflected, but\r\nin the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n300. The deflections were in the same direction as if a voltaic current had\r\nbeen passed through the galvanometer, i.e. the positively charged surface\r\nof the electric battery coincided with the positive end of the voltaic\r\napparatus (268.) and the negative surface of the former with the negative\r\nend of the latter.\r\n\r\n301. The battery was then thrown out of use, and the communications so\r\narranged that the current could be passed from the prime conductor, by the\r\ndischarging rod held against it, through the wet string, through the\r\ngalvanometer coil, and into the discharging train (292), by which it was\r\nfinally dispersed. This current could be stopped at any moment, by removing\r\nthe discharging rod, and either stopping the machine or connecting the\r\nprime conductor by another rod with the discharging train; and could be as\r\ninstantly renewed. The needle was so adjusted, that whilst vibrating in\r\nmoderate and small arcs, it required time equal to twenty-five beats of a\r\nwatch to pass in one direction through the arc, and of course an equal time\r\nto pass in the other direction.\r\n\r\n302. Thus arranged, and the needle being stationary, the current, direct\r\nfrom the machine, was sent through the galvanometer for twenty-five beats,\r\nthen interrupted for other twenty-five beats, renewed for twenty-five beats\r\nmore, again interrupted for an equal time, and so on continually. The\r\nneedle soon began to vibrate visibly, and after several alternations of\r\nthis kind, the vibration increased to 40° or more.\r\n\r\n303. On changing the direction of the current through the galvanometer, the\r\ndirection of the deflection of the needle was also changed. In all cases\r\nthe motion of the needle was in direction the same as that caused either by\r\nthe use of the electric battery or a voltaic trough (300).\r\n\r\n304. I now rejected the wet string, and substituted a copper wire, so that\r\nthe electricity of the machine passed at once into wires communicating\r\ndirectly with the discharging train, the galvanometer coil being one of the\r\nwires used for the discharge. The effects were exactly those obtained above\r\n(302).\r\n\r\n305. Instead of passing the electricity through the system, by bringing the\r\ndischarging rod at the end of it into contact with the conductor, four\r\npoints were fixed on to the rod; when the current was to pass, they were\r\nheld about twelve inches from the conductor, and when it was not to pass,\r\nthey were turned away. Then operating as before (302.), except with this\r\nvariation, the needle was soon powerfully deflected, and in perfect\r\nconsistency with the former results. Points afforded the means by which\r\nColladon, in all cases, made his discharges.\r\n\r\n306. Finally, I passed the electricity first through an exhausted receiver,\r\nso as to make it there resemble the aurora borealis, and then through the\r\ngalvanometer to the earth; and it was found still effective in deflecting\r\nthe needle, and apparently with the same force as before.\r\n\r\n307. From all these experiments, it appears that a current of common\r\nelectricity, whether transmitted through water or metal, or rarefied air,\r\nor by means of points in common air, is still able to deflect the needle;\r\nthe only requisite being, apparently, to allow time for its action: that it\r\nis, in fact, just as magnetic in every respect as a voltaic current, and\r\nthat in this character therefore no distinction exists.\r\n\r\n308. Imperfect conductors, as water, brine, acids, &c. &c. will be found\r\nfar more convenient for exhibiting these effects than other modes of\r\ndischarge, as by points or balls; for the former convert at once the charge\r\nof a powerful battery into a feeble spark discharge, or rather continuous\r\ncurrent, and involve little or no risk of deranging the magnetism of the\r\nneedles (294.).\r\n\r\n309. iii. _Chemical decomposition._--The chemical action of voltaic\r\nelectricity is characteristic of that agent, but not more characteristic\r\nthan are the _laws_ under which the bodies evolved by decomposition arrange\r\nthemselves at the poles. Dr. Wollaston showed[A] that common electricity\r\nresembled it in these effects, and \"that they are both essentially the\r\nsame\"; but he mingled with his proofs an experiment having a resemblance,\r\nand nothing more, to a case of voltaic decomposition, which however he\r\nhimself partly distinguished; and this has been more frequently referred to\r\nby some, on the one hand, to prove the occurrence of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition, like that of the pile, and by others to throw doubt upon the\r\nwhole paper, than the more numerous and decisive experiments which he has\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1801, pp. 427, 434.\r\n\r\n310. I take the liberty of describing briefly my results, and of thus\r\nadding my testimony to that of Dr. Wollaston on the identity of voltaic and\r\ncommon electricity as to chemical action, not only that I may facilitate\r\nthe repetition of the experiments, but also lead to some new consequences\r\nrespecting electrochemical decomposition (376. 377.).\r\n\r\n311. I first repeated Wollaston's fourth experiment[A], in which the ends\r\nof coated silver wires are immersed in a drop of sulphate of copper. By\r\npassing the electricity of the machine through such an arrangement, that\r\nend in the drop which received the electricity became coated with metallic\r\ncopper. One hundred turns of the machine produced an evident effect; two\r\nhundred turns a very sensible one. The decomposing action was however very\r\nfeeble. Very little copper was precipitated, and no sensible trace of\r\nsilver from the other pole appeared in the solution.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1801, p. 429.\r\n\r\n312. A much more convenient and effectual arrangement for chemical\r\ndecompositions by common electricity, is the following. Upon a glass plate,\r\nfig. 43, placed over, but raised above a piece of white paper, so that\r\nshadows may not interfere, put two pieces of tinfoil _a, b_; connect one of\r\nthese by an insulated wire _c_, or wire and string (301.) with the machine,\r\nand the other _g_, with the discharging train (292.) or the negative\r\nconductor; provide two pieces of fine platina wire, bent as in fig. 44, so\r\nthat the part _d, f_ shall be nearly upright, whilst the whole is resting\r\non the three bearing points _p, e, f_ place these as in fig. 43; the points\r\n_p, n_ then become the decomposing poles. In this way surfaces of contact,\r\nas minute as possible, can be obtained at pleasure, and the connexion can\r\nbe broken or renewed in a moment, and the substances acted upon examined\r\nwith the utmost facility.\r\n\r\n313. A coarse line was made on the glass with solution of sulphate of\r\ncopper, and the terminations _p_ and _n_ put into it; the foil _a_ was\r\nconnected with the positive conductor of the machine by wire and wet\r\nstring, so that no sparks passed: twenty turns of the machine caused the\r\nprecipitation of so much copper on the end _n_, that it looked like copper\r\nwire; no apparent change took place at _p_.\r\n\r\n314. A mixture of equal parts of muriatic acid and water was rendered deep\r\nblue by sulphate of indigo, and a large drop put on the glass, fig. 43, so\r\nthat _p_ and _n_ were immersed at opposite sides: a single turn of the\r\nmachine showed bleaching effects round _p_, from evolved chlorine. After\r\ntwenty revolutions no effect of the kind was visible at _n_, but so much\r\nchlorine had been set free at _p_, that when the drop was stirred the whole\r\nbecame colourless.\r\n\r\n315. A drop of solution of iodide of potassium mingled with starch was put\r\ninto the same position at _p_ and _n_; on turning the machine, iodine was\r\nevolved at _p_, but not at _n_.\r\n\r\n316. A still further improvement in this form of apparatus consists in\r\nwetting a piece of filtering paper in the solution to be experimented on,\r\nand placing that under the points _p_ and _n_, on the glass: the paper\r\nretains the substance evolved at the point of evolution, by its whiteness\r\nrenders any change of colour visible, and allows of the point of contact\r\nbetween it and the decomposing wires being contracted to the utmost degree.\r\nA piece of paper moistened in the solution of iodide of potassium and\r\nstarch, or of the iodide alone, with certain precautions (322.), is a most\r\nadmirable test of electro-chemical action; and when thus placed and acted\r\nupon by the electric current, will show iodine evolved at _p_ by only half\r\na turn of the machine. With these adjustments and the use of iodide of\r\npotassium on paper, chemical action is sometimes a more delicate test of\r\nelectrical currents than the galvanometer (273.). Such cases occur when the\r\nbodies traversed by the current are bad conductors, or when the quantity of\r\nelectricity evolved or transmitted in a given time is very small.\r\n\r\n317. A piece of litmus paper moistened in solution of common salt or\r\nsulphate of soda, was quickly reddened at _p_. A similar piece moistened in\r\nmuriatic acid was very soon bleached at _p_. No effects of a similar kind\r\ntook place at _n_.\r\n\r\n318. A piece of turmeric paper moistened in solution of sulphate of soda\r\nwas reddened at _n_ by two or three turns of the machine, and in twenty or\r\nthirty turns plenty of alkali was there evolved. On turning the paper\r\nround, so that the spot came under _p_, and then working the machine, the\r\nalkali soon disappeared, the place became yellow, and a brown alkaline spot\r\nappeared in the new part under _n_.\r\n\r\n319. On combining a piece of litmus with a piece of turmeric paper, wetting\r\nboth with solution of sulphate of soda, and putting the paper on the glass,\r\nso that _p_ was on the litmus and _n_ on the turmeric, a very few turns of\r\nthe machine sufficed to show the evolution of acid at the former and alkali\r\nat the latter, exactly in the manner effected by a volta-electric current.\r\n\r\n320. All these decompositions took place equally well, whether the\r\nelectricity passed from the machine to the foil _a_, through water, or\r\nthrough wire only; by _contact_ with the conductor, or by _sparks_ there;\r\nprovided the sparks were not so large as to cause the electricity to pass\r\nin sparks from _p_ to _n_, or towards _n_; and I have seen no reason to\r\nbelieve that in cases of true electro-chemical decomposition by the\r\nmachine, the electricity passed in sparks from the conductor, or at any\r\npart of the current, is able to do more, because of its tension, than that\r\nwhich is made to pass merely as a regular current.\r\n\r\n321. Finally, the experiment was extended into the following form,\r\nsupplying in this case the tidiest analogy between common and voltaic\r\nelectricity. Three compound pieces of litmus and turmeric paper (319.) were\r\nmoistened in solution of sulphate of soda, and arranged on a plate of glass\r\nwith platina wires, as in fig. 45. The wire _m_ was connected with the\r\nprime conductor of the machine, the wire _t_ with the discharging train,\r\nand the wires _r_ and _s_ entered into the course of the electrical current\r\nby means of the pieces of moistened paper; they were so bent as to rest\r\neach on three points, _n, r, p; n, s, p_, the points _r_ and _s_ being\r\nsupported by the glass, and the others by the papers; the three\r\nterminations _p, p, p_ rested on the litmus, and the other three _n, n, n_\r\non the turmeric paper. On working the machine for a short time only, acid\r\nwas evolved at _all_ the poles or terminations _p, p, p_, by which the\r\nelectricity entered the solution, and alkali at the other poles _n, n, n_,\r\nby which the electricity left the solution.\r\n\r\n322. In all experiments of electro-chemical decomposition by the common\r\nmachine and moistened papers (316.), it is necessary to be aware of and to\r\navoid the following important source of error. If a spark passes over\r\nmoistened litmus and turmeric paper, the litmus paper (provided it be\r\ndelicate and not too alkaline,) is reddened by it; and if several sparks\r\nare passed, it becomes powerfully reddened. If the electricity pass a\r\nlittle way from the wire over the surface of the moistened paper, before it\r\nfinds mass and moisture enough to conduct it, then the reddening extends as\r\nfar as the ramifications. If similar ramifications occur at the termination\r\n_n_, on the turmeric paper, they _prevent_ the occurrence of the red spot\r\ndue to the alkali, which would otherwise collect there: sparks or\r\nramifications from the points _n_ will also redden litmus paper. If paper\r\nmoistened by a solution of iodide of potassium (which is an admirably\r\ndelicate test of electro-chemical action,) be exposed to the sparks or\r\nramifications, or even a feeble stream of electricity through the air from\r\neither the point _p_ or _n_, iodine will be immediately evolved.\r\n\r\n323. These effects must not be confounded with those due to the true\r\nelectro-chemical powers of common electricity, and must be carefully\r\navoided when the latter are to be observed. No sparks should be passed,\r\ntherefore, in any part of the current, nor any increase of intensity\r\nallowed, by which the electricity may be induced to pass between the\r\nplatina wires and the moistened papers, otherwise than by conduction; for\r\nif it burst through the air, the effect referred to above (322.) ensues.\r\n\r\n324. The effect itself is due to the formation of nitric acid by the\r\ncombination of the oxygen and nitrogen of the air, and is, in fact, only a\r\ndelicate repetition of Cavendish's beautiful experiment. The acid so\r\nformed, though small in quantity, is in a high state of concentration as to\r\nwater, and produces the consequent effects of reddening the litmus paper;\r\nor preventing the exhibition of alkali on the turmeric paper; or, by acting\r\non the iodide of potassium, evolving iodine.\r\n\r\n325. By moistening a very small slip of litmus paper in solution of caustic\r\npotassa, and then passing the electric spark over its length in the air, I\r\ngradually neutralized the alkali, and ultimately rendered the paper red; on\r\ndrying it, I found that nitrate of potassa had resulted from the operation,\r\nand that the paper had become touch-paper.\r\n\r\n326. Either litmus paper or white paper, moistened in a strong solution of\r\niodide of potassium, offers therefore a very simple, beautiful, and ready\r\nmeans of illustrating Cavendish's experiment of the formation of nitric\r\nacid from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n327. I have already had occasion to refer to an experiment (265. 309.) made\r\nby Dr. Wollaston, which is insisted upon too much, both by those who oppose\r\nand those who agree with the accuracy of his views respecting the identity\r\nof voltaic and ordinary electricity. By covering fine wires with glass or\r\nother insulating substances, and then removing only so much matter as to\r\nexpose the point, or a section of the wires, and by passing electricity\r\nthrough two such wires, the guarded points of which were immersed in water,\r\nWollaston found that the water could be decomposed even by the current from\r\nthe machine, without sparks, and that two streams of gas arose from the\r\npoints, exactly resembling, in appearance, those produced by voltaic\r\nelectricity, and, like the latter, giving a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen\r\ngases. But Dr. Wollaston himself points out that the effect is different\r\nfrom that of the voltaic pile, inasmuch as both oxygen and hydrogen are\r\nevolved from _each_ pole; he calls it \"a very close _imitation_ of the\r\ngalvanic phenomena,\" but adds that \"in fact the resemblance is not\r\ncomplete,\" and does not trust to it to establish the principles correctly\r\nlaid down in his paper.\r\n\r\n328. This experiment is neither more nor less than a repetition, in a\r\nrefined manner, of that made by Dr. Pearson in 1797[A], and previously by\r\nMM. Paets Van Troostwyk and Deiman in 1789 or earlier. That the experiment\r\nshould never be quoted as proving true electro-chemical decomposition, is\r\nsufficiently evident from the circumstance, that the _law_ which regulates\r\nthe transference and final place of the evolved bodies (278. 309.) has no\r\ninfluence here. The water is decomposed at both poles independently of each\r\nother, and the oxygen and hydrogen evolved at the wires are the elements of\r\nthe water existing the instant before in those places. That the poles, or\r\nrather points, have no mutual decomposing dependence, may be shown by\r\nsubstituting a wire, or the finger, for one of them, a change which does\r\nnot at all interfere with the other, though it stops all action at the\r\nchanged pole. This fact may be observed by turning the machine for some\r\ntime; for though bubbles will rise from the point left unaltered, in\r\nquantity sufficient to cover entirely the wire used for the other\r\ncommunication, if they could be applied to it, yet not a single bubble will\r\nappear on that wire.\r\n\r\n  [A] Nicholson's Journal, 4to. vol. I. pp. 311, 299. 349.\r\n\r\n329. When electro-chemical decomposition takes place, there is great reason\r\nto believe that the _quantity_ of matter decomposed is not proportionate to\r\nthe intensity, but to the quantity of electricity passed (320.). Of this I\r\nshall be able to offer some proofs in a future part of this paper (375.\r\n377.). But in the experiment under consideration, this is not the case. If,\r\nwith a constant pair of points, the electricity be passed from the machine\r\nin sparks, a certain proportion of gas is evolved; but if the sparks be\r\nrendered shorter, less gas is evolved; and if no sparks be passed, there is\r\nscarcely a sensible portion of gases set free. On substituting solution of\r\nsulphate of soda for water, scarcely a sensible quantity of gas could be\r\nprocured even with powerful sparks, and nearly none with the mere current;\r\nyet the quantity of electricity in a given time was the same in all these\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n330. I do not intend to deny that with such an apparatus common electricity\r\ncan decompose water in a manner analogous to that of the voltaic pile; I\r\nbelieve at present that it can. But when what I consider the true effect\r\nonly was obtained, the quantity of gas given off was so small that I could\r\nnot ascertain whether it was, as it ought to be, oxygen at one wire and\r\nhydrogen at the other. Of the two streams one seemed more copious than the\r\nother, and on turning the apparatus round, still the same side in relation\r\nto the machine; gave the largest stream. On substituting solution of\r\nsulphate of soda for pure water (329.), these minute streams were still\r\nobserved. But the quantities were so small, that on working the machine for\r\nhalf an hour I could not obtain at either pole a bubble of gas larger than\r\na small grain of sand. If the conclusion which I have drawn (377.) relating\r\nto the amount of chemical action be correct, this ought to be the case.\r\n\r\n331. I have been the more anxious to assign the true value of this\r\nexperiment as a test of electro-chemical action, because I shall have\r\noccasion to refer to it in cases of supposed chemical action by\r\nmagneto-electric and other electric currents (336. 346.) and elsewhere.\r\nBut, independent of it, there cannot be now a doubt that Dr. Wollaston was\r\nright in his general conclusion; and that voltaic and common electricity\r\nhave powers of chemical decomposition, alike in their nature, and governed\r\nby the same law of arrangement.\r\n\r\n332. iv. _Physiological effects._--The power of the common electric current\r\nto shock and convulse the animal system, and when weak to affect the tongue\r\nand the eyes, may be considered as the same with the similar power of\r\nvoltaic electricity, account being taken of the intensity of the one\r\nelectricity and duration of the other. When a wet thread was interposed in\r\nthe course of the current of common electricity from the battery (291.)\r\ncharged by eight or ten[A] revolutions of the machine in good action\r\n(290.), and the discharge made by platina spatulas through the tongue or\r\nthe gums, the effect upon the tongue and eyes was exactly that of a\r\nmomentary feeble voltaic circuit.\r\n\r\n  [A] Or even from thirty to forty.\r\n\r\n333. v. _Spark._--The beautiful flash of light attending the discharge of\r\ncommon electricity is well known. It rivals in brilliancy, if it does not\r\neven very much surpass, the light from the discharge of voltaic\r\nelectricity; but it endures for an instant only, and is attended by a sharp\r\nnoise like that of a small explosion. Still no difficulty can arise in\r\nrecognising it to be the same spark as that from the voltaic battery,\r\nespecially under certain circumstances. The eye cannot distinguish the\r\ndifference between a voltaic and a common electricity spark, if they be\r\ntaken between amalgamated surfaces of metal, at intervals only, and through\r\nthe same distance of air.\r\n\r\n334. When the Leyden battery (291.) was discharged through a wet string\r\nplaced in some part of the circuit away from the place where the spark was\r\nto pass, the spark was yellowish, flamy, having a duration sensibly longer\r\nthan if the water had not been interposed, was about three-fourths of an\r\ninch in length, was accompanied by little or no noise, and whilst losing\r\npart of its usual character had approximated in some degree to the voltaic\r\nspark. When the electricity retarded by water was discharged between pieces\r\nof charcoal, it was exceedingly luminous and bright upon both surfaces of\r\nthe charcoal, resembling the brightness of the voltaic discharge on such\r\nsurfaces. When the discharge of the unretarded electricity was taken upon\r\ncharcoal, it was bright upon both the surfaces, (in that respect resembling\r\nthe voltaic spark,) but the noise was loud, sharp, and ringing.\r\n\r\n335. I have assumed, in accordance, I believe, with the opinion of every\r\nother philosopher, that atmospheric electricity is of the same nature with\r\nordinary electricity (284.), and I might therefore refer to certain\r\npublished statements of chemical effects produced by the former as proofs\r\nthat the latter enjoys the power of decomposition in common with voltaic\r\nelectricity. But the comparison I am drawing is far too rigorous to allow\r\nme to use these statements without being fully assured of their accuracy;\r\nyet I have no right to suppress them, because, if accurate, they establish\r\nwhat I am labouring to put on an undoubted foundation, and have priority to\r\nmy results.\r\n\r\n336. M. Bonijol of Geneva[A] is said to have constructed very delicate\r\napparatus for the decomposition of water by common electricity. By\r\nconnecting an insulated lightning rod with his apparatus, the decomposition\r\nof the water proceeded in a continuous and rapid manner even when the\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere was not very powerful. The apparatus is not\r\ndescribed; but as the diameter of the wire is mentioned as very small, it\r\nappears to have been similar in construction to that of Wollaston (327.);\r\nand as that does not furnish a case of true polar electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition (328.), this result of M. Bonijol does not prove the identity\r\nin chemical action of common and voltaic electricity.\r\n\r\n  [A] Bibliothèque Universelle, 1830, tome xlv. p. 213.\r\n\r\n337. At the same page of the Bibliothèque Universelle, M. Bonijol is said\r\nto have decomposed, _potash_, and also chloride of silver, by putting them\r\ninto very narrow tubes and passing electric sparks from an ordinary machine\r\nover them. It is evident that these offer no analogy to cases of true\r\nvoltaic decomposition, where the electricity only decomposes when it is\r\n_conducted_ by the body acted upon, and ceases to decompose, according to\r\nits ordinary laws, when it passes in sparks. These effects are probably\r\npartly analogous to that which takes place with water in Pearson's or\r\nWollaston's apparatus, and may be due to very high temperature acting on\r\nminute portions of matter; or they may be connected with the results in air\r\n(322.). As nitrogen can combine directly with oxygen under the influence of\r\nthe electric spark (324.), it is not impossible that it should even take it\r\nfrom the potassium of the potash, especially as there would be plenty of\r\npotassa in contact with the acting particles to combine with the nitric\r\nacid formed. However distinct all these actions may be from true polar\r\nelectro-chemical decompositions, they are still highly important, and\r\nwell-worthy of investigation.\r\n\r\n338. The late Mr. Barry communicated a paper to the Royal Society[A] last\r\nyear, so distinct in the details, that it would seem at once to prove the\r\nidentity in chemical action of common and voltaic electricity; but, when\r\nexamined, considerable difficulty arises in reconciling certain of the\r\neffects with the remainder. He used two tubes, each having a wire within it\r\npassing through the closed end, as is usual for voltaic decompositions. The\r\ntubes were filled with solution of sulphate of soda, coloured with syrup of\r\nviolets, and connected by a portion of the same solution, in the ordinary\r\nmanner; the wire in one tube was connected by a _gilt thread_ with the\r\nstring of an insulated electrical kite, and the wire in the other tube by a\r\nsimilar _gilt thread_ with the ground. Hydrogen soon appeared in the tube\r\nconnected with the kite, and oxygen in the other, and in ten minutes the\r\nliquid in the first tube was green from the alkali evolved, and that in the\r\nother red from free acid produced. The only indication of the strength or\r\nintensity of the atmospheric electricity is in the expression, \"the usual\r\nshocks were felt on touching the string.\"\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1831, p. 165.\r\n\r\n339. That the electricity in this case does not resemble that from any\r\nordinary source of common electricity, is shown by several circumstances.\r\nWollaston could not effect the decomposition of water by such an\r\narrangement, and obtain the gases in _separate_ vessels, using common\r\nelectricity; nor have any of the numerous philosophers, who have employed\r\nsuch an apparatus, obtained any such decomposition, either of water or of a\r\nneutral salt, by the use of the machine. I have lately tried the large\r\nmachine (290.) in full action for a quarter of an hour, during which time\r\nseven hundred revolutions were made, without producing any sensible\r\neffects, although the shocks that it would then give must have been far\r\nmore powerful and numerous than could have been taken, with any chance of\r\nsafety, from an electrical kite-string; and by reference to the comparison\r\nhereafter to be made (371.), it will be seen that for common electricity to\r\nhave produced the effect, the quantity must have been awfully great, and\r\napparently far more than could have been conducted to the earth by a gilt\r\nthread, and at the same time only have produced the \"usual shocks.\"\r\n\r\n340. That the electricity was apparently not analogous to voltaic\r\nelectricity is evident, for the \"usual shocks\" only were produced, and\r\nnothing like the terrible sensation due to a voltaic battery, even when it\r\nhas a tension so feeble as not to strike through the eighth of an inch of\r\nair.\r\n\r\n341. It seems just possible that the air which was passing by the kite and\r\nstring, being in an electrical state sufficient to produce the \"usual\r\nshocks\" only, could still, when the electricity was drawn off below, renew\r\nthe charge, and so continue the current. The string was 1500 feet long, and\r\ncontained two double threads. But when the enormous quantity which must\r\nhave been thus collected is considered (371. 376.), the explanation seems\r\nvery doubtful. I charged a voltaic battery of twenty pairs of plates four\r\ninches square with double coppers very strongly, insulated it, connected\r\nits positive extremity with the discharging train (292.), and its negative\r\npole with an apparatus like that of Mr. Barry, communicating by a wire\r\ninserted three inches into the wet soil of the ground. This battery thus\r\narranged produced feeble decomposing effects, as nearly as I could judge\r\nanswering the description Mr. Barry has given. Its intensity was, of\r\ncourse, far lower than the electricity of the kite-string, but the supply\r\nof quantity from the discharging train was unlimited. It gave no shocks to\r\ncompare with the \"usual shocks\" of a kite-string.\r\n\r\n342. Mr. Barry's experiment is a very important one to repeat and verify.\r\nIf confirmed, it will be, as far as I am aware, the first recorded case of\r\ntrue electro-chemical decomposition of water by common electricity, and it\r\nwill supply a form of electrical current, which, both in quantity and\r\nintensity, is exactly intermediate with those of the common electrical\r\nmachine and the voltaic pile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIII. _Magneto-Electricity._\r\n\r\n343. _Tension_.--The attractions and repulsions due to the tension of\r\nordinary electricity have been well observed with that evolved by\r\nmagneto-electric induction. M. Pixii, by using an apparatus, clever in its\r\nconstruction and powerful in its action[A], was able to obtain great\r\ndivergence of the gold leaves of an electrometer[B].\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, l. p. 322.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. li. p 77.\r\n\r\n344. _In motion_: i. _Evolution of Heat._--The current produced by\r\nmagneto-electric induction can heat a wire in the manner of ordinary\r\nelectricity. At the British Association of Science at Oxford, in June of\r\nthe present year, I had the pleasure, in conjunction with Mr. Harris,\r\nProfessor Daniell, Mr. Duncan, and others, of making an experiment, for\r\nwhich the great magnet in the museum, Mr. Harris's new electrometer (287.),\r\nand the magneto-electric coil described in my first paper (34.), were put\r\nin requisition. The latter had been modified in the manner I have elsewhere\r\ndescribed[A] so as to produce an electric spark when its contact with the\r\nmagnet was made or broken. The terminations of the spiral, adjusted so as\r\nto have their contact with each other broken when the spark was to pass,\r\nwere connected with the wire in the electrometer, and it was found that\r\neach time the magnetic contact was made and broken, expansion of the air\r\nwithin the instrument occurred, indicating an increase, at the moment, of\r\nthe temperature of the wire.\r\n\r\n  [A] Phil, Mag. and Annals, 1832, vol. xi. p. 405.\r\n\r\n315. ii. _Magnetism._--These currents were discovered by their magnetic\r\npower.\r\n\r\n346. iii. _Chemical decomposition._--I have made many endeavours to effect\r\nchemical decomposition by magneto-electricity, but unavailingly. In July\r\nlast I received an anonymous letter (which has since been published[A],)\r\ndescribing a magneto-electric apparatus, by which the decomposition of\r\nwater was effected. As the term \"guarded points\" is used, I suppose the\r\napparatus to have been Wollaston's (327. &c.), in which case the results\r\ndid not indicate polar electro-chemical decomposition. Signor Botto has\r\nrecently published certain results which he has obtained[B]; but they are,\r\nas at present described, inconclusive. The apparatus he used was apparently\r\nthat of Dr. Wollaston, which gives only fallacious indications (327. &c.).\r\nAs magneto-electricity can produce sparks, it would be able to show the\r\neffects proper to this apparatus. The apparatus of M. Pixii already\r\nreferred to (343.) has however, in the hands of himself[C] and M.\r\nHachctte[D], given decisive chemical results, so as to complete this link\r\nin the chain of evidence. Water was decomposed by it, and the oxygen and\r\nhydrogen obtained in separate tubes according to the law governing\r\nvolta-electric and machine-electric decomposition.\r\n\r\n  [A] Lond. and Edinb.

The sensation upon the tongue, and the\r\nflash before the eyes, which I at first obtained only in a feeble degree\r\n(56.), have been since exalted by more powerful apparatus, so as to become\r\neven disagreeable.\r\n\r\n348. v. _Spark._--The feeble spark which I first obtained with these\r\ncurrents (32.), has been varied and strengthened by Signori Nobili and\r\nAntinori, and others, so as to leave no doubt as to its identity with the\r\ncommon electric spark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIV. _Thermo-Electricity._\r\n\r\n349. With regard to thermo-electricity, (that beautiful form of electricity\r\ndiscovered by Seebeck,) the very conditions under which it is excited are\r\nsuch as to give no ground for expecting that it can be raised like common\r\nelectricity to any high degree of tension; the effects, therefore, due to\r\nthat state are not to be expected. The sum of evidence respecting its\r\nanalogy to the electricities already described, is, I believe, as\r\nfollows:--_Tension._ The attractions and repulsions due to a certain degree\r\nof tension have not been observed. _In currents_: i. _Evolution of Heat._ I\r\nam not aware that its power of raising temperature has been observed. ii.\r\n_Magnetism._ It was discovered, and is best recognised, by its magnetic\r\npowers. iii. _Chemical decomposition_ has not been effected by it. iv.\r\n_Physiological effects._ Nobili has shown[A] that these currents are able\r\nto cause contractions in the limbs of a frog. v. _Spark._ The spark has not\r\nyet been seen.\r\n\r\n  [A] Bibliothèque Universelle, xxxvii. 15.\r\n\r\n350. Only those effects are weak or deficient which depend upon a certain\r\nhigh degree of intensity; and if common electricity be reduced in that\r\nquality to a similar degree with the thermo-electricity, it can produce no\r\neffects beyond the latter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nV. _Animal Electricity._\r\n\r\n351. After an examination of the experiments of Walsh[A] Ingenhousz[B],\r\nCavendish[C], Sir H. Davy[D], and Dr. Davy[E], no doubt remains on my mind\r\nas to the identity of the electricity of the torpedo with common and\r\nvoltaic electricity; and I presume that so little will remain on the minds\r\nof others as to justify my refraining from entering at length into the\r\nphilosophical proofs of that identity. The doubts raised by Sir H. Davy\r\nhave been removed by his brother Dr. Davy; the results of the latter being\r\nthe reverse of those of the former. At present the sum of evidence is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1773, p. 461.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. 1775, p. 1.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. 1776, p. 196.\r\n\r\n  [D] Ibid. 1829, p. 15.\r\n\r\n  [E] Ibid. 1832, p. 259.\r\n\r\n352. _Tension._--No sensible attractions or repulsions due to tension have\r\nbeen observed.\r\n\r\n353. _In motion_: i. Evolution of Heat; not yet observed; I have little or\r\nno doubt that Harris's electrometer would show it (287. 359.).\r\n\r\n354. ii. _Magnetism._--Perfectly distinct. According to Dr. Davy[A], the\r\ncurrent deflected the needle and made magnets under the same law, as to\r\ndirection, which governs currents of ordinary and voltaic electricity.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1832, p. 260.\r\n\r\n355. iii. _Chemical decomposition._--Also distinct; and though Dr. Davy\r\nused an apparatus of similar construction with that of Dr. Wollaston\r\n(327.), still no error in the present case is involved, for the\r\ndecompositions were polar, and in their nature truly electro-chemical. By\r\nthe direction of the magnet it was found that the under surface of the fish\r\nwas negative, and the upper positive; and in the chemical decompositions,\r\nsilver and lead were precipitated on the wire connected with the under\r\nsurface, and not on the other; and when these wires were either steel or\r\nsilver, in solution of common salt, gas (hydrogen?) rose from the negative\r\nwire, but none from the positive.\r\n\r\n356. Another reason for the decomposition being electrochemical is, that a\r\nWollaston's apparatus constructed with _wires_, coated by sealing-wax,\r\nwould most probably not have decomposed water, even in its own peculiar\r\nway, unless the electricity had risen high enough in intensity to produce\r\nsparks in some part of the circuit; whereas the torpedo was not able to\r\nproduce sensible sparks. A third reason is, that the purer the water in\r\nWollaston's apparatus, the more abundant is the decomposition; and I have\r\nfound that a machine and wire points which succeeded perfectly well with\r\ndistilled water, failed altogether when the water was rendered a good\r\nconductor by sulphate of soda, common salt, or other saline bodies. But in\r\nDr. Davy's experiments with the torpedo, _strong_ solutions of salt,\r\nnitrate of silver, and superacetate of lead were used successfully, and\r\nthere is no doubt with more success than weaker ones.\r\n\r\n357. iv. _Physiological effects._--These are so characteristic, that by\r\nthem the peculiar powers of the torpedo and gymnotus are principally\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\n358. v. _Spark._--The electric spark has not yet been obtained, or at least\r\nI think not; but perhaps I had better refer to the evidence on this point.\r\nHumboldt, speaking of results obtained by M. Fahlberg, of Sweden, says,\r\n\"This philosopher has seen an electric spark, as Walsh and Ingenhousz had\r\ndone before him in London, by placing the gymnotus in the air, and\r\ninterrupting the conducting chain by two gold leaves pasted upon glass, and\r\na line distant from each other[A].\" I cannot, however, find any record of\r\nsuch an observation by either Walsh or Ingenhousz, and do not know where to\r\nrefer to that by M. Fahlberg. M. Humboldt could not himself perceive any\r\nluminous effect.\r\n\r\n  [A] Edinburgh Phil. Journal, ii. p. 249.\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir John Leslie, in his dissertation on the progress of mathematical\r\nand physical science, prefixed to the seventh edition of the Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica, Edinb. 1830, p. 622, says, \"From a healthy specimen\" of the\r\n_Silurus electricus,_ meaning rather the _gymnotus_, \"exhibited in London,\r\nvivid sparks were drawn in a darkened room\"; but he does not say he saw\r\nthem himself, nor state who did see them; nor can I find any account of\r\nsuch a phenomenon; so that the statement is doubtful[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Mr. Brayley, who referred me to those statements, and has\r\n  extensive knowledge of recorded facts, is unacquainted with any\r\n  further account relating to them.\r\n\r\n359. In concluding this summary of the powers of torpedinal electricity, I\r\ncannot refrain from pointing out the enormous absolute quantity of\r\nelectricity which the animal must put in circulation at each effort. It is\r\ndoubtful whether any common electrical machine has as yet been able to\r\nsupply electricity sufficient in a reasonable time to cause true\r\nelectro-chemical decomposition of water (330. 339.), yet the current from\r\nthe torpedo has done it. The same high proportion is shown by the magnetic\r\neffects (296. 371.). These circumstances indicate that the torpedo has\r\npower (in the way probably that Cavendish describes,) to continue the\r\nevolution for a sensible time, so that its successive discharges rather\r\nresemble those of a voltaic arrangement, intermitting in its action, than\r\nthose of a Leyden apparatus, charged and discharged many times in\r\nsuccession. In reality, however, there is _no philosophical difference_\r\nbetween these two cases.\r\n\r\n360. The _general conclusion_ which must, I think, be drawn from this\r\ncollection of facts is, that _electricity, whatever may be its source, is\r\nidentical in its nature_. The phenomena in the five kinds or species\r\nquoted, differ, not in their character but only in degree; and in that\r\nrespect vary in proportion to the variable circumstances of _quantity_ and\r\n_intensity_[A] which can at pleasure be made to change in almost any one of\r\nthe kinds of electricity, as much as it does between one kind and another.\r\n\r\n  [A] The term _quantity_ in electricity is perhaps sufficiently definite\r\nas to sense; the term _intensity_ is more difficult to define strictly.\r\nI am using the terms in their ordinary and accepted meaning.\r\n\r\nTable of the experimental Effects common to the Electricities derived from\r\ndifferent Sources[A].\r\n\r\nTable headings\r\n\r\nA: Physiological Effects\r\nB: Magnetic Deflection.\r\nC: Magnets made.\r\nD: Spark.\r\nE: Heating Power.\r\nF: True chemical Action.\r\nG: Attraction and Repulsion.\r\nH: Discharge by Hot Air.\r\n _________________________________________________________\r\n|                         |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n|                         | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |\r\n|_________________________|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|\r\n|                         |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n| 1.

Thus with _thermo-electricity_, Botto made magnets and\r\n  obtained polar chemical decomposition: Antinori produced the spark;\r\n  and if it has not been done before, Mr. Watkins has recently heated a\r\n  wire in Harris's thermo-electrometer. In respect to _animal\r\n  electricity_, Matteucci and Linari have obtained the spark from the\r\n  torpedo, and I have recently procured it from the gymnotus: Dr. Davy\r\n  has observed the heating power of the current from the torpedo. I have\r\n  therefore filled up these spaces with crosses, in a different position\r\n  to the others originally in the table. There remain but five spaces\r\n  unmarked, two under _attraction_ and _repulsion_, and three under\r\n  _discharge by hot air_; and though these effects have not yet been\r\n  obtained, it is a necessary conclusion that they must be possible,\r\n  since the _spark_ corresponding to them has been procured. For when a\r\n  discharge across cold air can occur, that intensity which is the only\r\n  essential additional requisite for the other effects must be\r\n  present.--_Dec. 13 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. _Relation by Measure of common and voltaic Electricity._[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] In further illustration of this subject see 855-873 in Series\r\n  VII.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n361. Believing the point of identity to be satisfactorily established, I\r\nnext endeavoured to obtain a common measure, or a known relation as to\r\nquantity, of the electricity excited by a machine, and that from a voltaic\r\npile; for the purpose not only of confirming their identity (378.), but\r\nalso of demonstrating certain general principles (366, 377, &c.), and\r\ncreating an extension of the means of investigating and applying the\r\nchemical powers of this wonderful and subtile agent.\r\n\r\n362. The first point to be determined was, whether the same absolute\r\nquantity of ordinary electricity, sent through a galvanometer, under\r\ndifferent circumstances, would cause the same deflection of the needle. An\r\narbitrary scale was therefore attached to the galvanometer, each division\r\nof which was equal to about 4°, and the instrument arranged as in former\r\nexperiments (296.). The machine (290.), battery (291.), and other parts of\r\nthe apparatus were brought into good order, and retained for the time as\r\nnearly as possible in the same condition. The experiments were alternated\r\nso as to indicate any change in the condition of the apparatus and supply\r\nthe necessary corrections.\r\n\r\n363. Seven of the battery jars were removed, and eight retained for present\r\nuse. It was found that about forty turns would fully charge the eight jars.\r\nThey were then charged by thirty turns of the machine, and discharged\r\nthrough the galvanometer, a thick wet string, about ten inches long, being\r\nincluded in the circuit. The needle was immediately deflected five\r\ndivisions and a half, on the one side of the zero, and in vibrating passed\r\nas nearly as possible through five divisions and a half on the other side.\r\n\r\n364. The other seven jars were then added to the eight, and the whole\r\nfifteen charged by thirty turns of the machine. The Henley's electrometer\r\nstood not quite half as high as before; but when the discharge was made\r\nthrough the galvanometer, previously at rest, the needle immediately\r\nvibrated, passing _exactly_ to the same division as in the former instance.\r\nThese experiments with eight and with fifteen jars were repeated several\r\ntimes alternately with the same results.\r\n\r\n365. Other experiments were then made, in which all the battery was used,\r\nand its charge (being fifty turns of the machine,) sent through the\r\ngalvanometer: but it was modified by being passed sometimes through a mere\r\nwet thread, sometimes through thirty-eight inches of thin string wetted by\r\ndistilled water, and sometimes through a string of twelve times the\r\nthickness, only twelve inches in length, and soaked in dilute acid (298.).\r\nWith the thick string the charge passed at once; with the thin string it\r\noccupied a sensible time, and with the thread it required two or three\r\nseconds before the electrometer fell entirely down. The current therefore\r\nmust have varied extremely in intensity in these different cases, and yet\r\nthe deflection of the needle was sensibly the same in all of them. If any\r\ndifference occurred, it was that the thin string and thread caused greatest\r\ndeflection; and if there is any lateral transmission, as M. Colladon says,\r\nthrough the silk in the galvanometer coil, it ought to have been so,\r\nbecause then the intensity is lower and the lateral transmission less.\r\n\r\n366. Hence it would appear that _if the same absolute quantity of\r\nelectricity pass through the galvanometer, whatever may be its intensity,\r\nthe dejecting force upon the magnetic needle is the same._\r\n\r\n367. The battery of fifteen jars was then charged by sixty revolutions of\r\nthe machine, and discharged, as before, through the galvanometer. The\r\ndeflection of the needle was now as nearly as possible to the eleventh\r\ndivision, but the graduation was not accurate enough for me to assert that\r\nthe arc was exactly double the former arc; to the eye it appeared to be so.\r\nThe probability is, that _the deflecting force of an electric current is\r\ndirectly proportional to the absolute quantity of electricity passed_, at\r\nwhatever intensity that electricity may be[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] The great and general value of the galvanometer, as an actual\r\n  measure of the electricity passing through it, either continuously or\r\n  interruptedly, must be evident from a consideration of these two\r\n  conclusions. As constructed by Professor Ritchie with glass threads\r\n  (see Philosophical Transactions, 1830, p. 218, and Quarterly Journal\r\n  of Science, New Series, vol. i. p.29.), it apparently seems to leave\r\n  nothing unsupplied in its own department.\r\n\r\n368. Dr. Ritchie has shown that in a case where the intensity of the\r\nelectricity remained the same, the deflection of the magnetic needle was\r\ndirectly as the quantity of electricity passed through the galvanometer[A].\r\nMr. Harris has shown that the _heating_ power of common electricity on\r\nmetallic wires is the same for the same quantity of electricity whatever\r\nits intensity might have previously been[B].\r\n\r\n  [A] Quarterly Journal of Science, New Series, vol. i. p. 33.\r\n\r\n  [B] Plymouth Transactions, page 22.\r\n\r\n369. The next point was to obtain a _voltaic_ arrangement producing an\r\neffect equal to that just described (367.). A platina and a zinc wire were\r\npassed through the same hole of a draw-plate, being then one eighteenth of\r\nan inch in diameter; these were fastened to a support, so that their lower\r\nends projected, were parallel, and five sixteenths of an inch apart. The\r\nupper ends were well-connected with the galvanometer wires. Some acid was\r\ndiluted, and, after various preliminary experiments, that adopted as a\r\nstandard which consisted of one drop strong sulphuric acid in four ounces\r\ndistilled water. Finally, the time was noted which the needle required in\r\nswinging either from right to left or left to right: it was equal to\r\nseventeen beats of my watch, the latter giving one hundred and fifty in a\r\nminute. The object of these preparations was to arrange a voltaic\r\napparatus, which, by immersion in a given acid for a given time, much less\r\nthan that required by the needle to swing in one direction, should give\r\nequal deflection to the instrument with the discharge of ordinary\r\nelectricity from the battery (363. 364.); and a new part of the zinc wire\r\nhaving been brought into position with the platina, the comparative\r\nexperiments were made.\r\n\r\n370. On plunging the zinc and platina wires five eighths of an inch deep\r\ninto the acid, and retaining them there for eight beats of the watch,\r\n(after which they were quickly withdrawn,) the needle was deflected, and\r\ncontinued to advance in the same direction some time after the voltaic\r\napparatus had been removed from the acid. It attained the five-and-a-half\r\ndivision, and then returned swinging an equal distance on the other side.\r\nThis experiment was repeated many times, and always with the same result.\r\n\r\n371. Hence, as an approximation, and judging from _magnetic force_ only at\r\npresent (376.), it would appear that two wires, one of platina and one of\r\nzinc, each one eighteenth of an inch in diameter, placed five sixteenths of\r\nan inch apart and immersed to the depth of five eighths of an inch in acid,\r\nconsisting of one drop oil of vitriol and four ounces distilled water, at a\r\ntemperature about 60°, and connected at the other extremities by a copper\r\nwire eighteen feet long and one eighteenth of an inch thick (being the wire\r\nof the galvanometer coils), yield as much electricity in eight beats of my\r\nwatch, or in 8/150ths of a minute, as the electrical battery charged by\r\nthirty turns of the large machine, in excellent order (363. 364.).\r\nNotwithstanding this apparently enormous disproportion, the results are\r\nperfectly in harmony with those effects which are known to be produced by\r\nvariations in the intensity and quantity of the electric fluid.\r\n\r\n372. In order to procure a reference to _chemical action_, the wires were\r\nnow retained immersed in the acid to the depth of five eighths of an inch,\r\nand the needle, when stationary, observed; it stood, as nearly as the\r\nunassisted eye could decide, at 5-1/3 division. Hence a permanent\r\ndeflection to that extent might be considered as indicating a constant\r\nvoltaic current, which in eight beats of my watch (369.) could supply as\r\nmuch electricity as the electrical battery charged by thirty turns of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n373. The following arrangements and results are selected from many that\r\nwere made and obtained relative to chemical action. A platina wire one\r\ntwelfth of an inch in diameter, weighing two hundred and sixty grains, had\r\nthe extremity rendered plain, so as to offer a definite surface equal to a\r\ncircle of the same diameter as the wire; it was then connected in turn with\r\nthe conductor of the machine, or with the voltaic apparatus (369.), so as\r\nalways to form the positive pole, and at the same time retain a\r\nperpendicular position, that it might rest, with its whole weight, upon the\r\ntest paper to be employed. The test paper itself was supported upon a\r\nplatina spatula, connected either with the discharging train (292.), or\r\nwith the negative wire of the voltaic apparatus, and it consisted of four\r\nthicknesses, moistened at all times to an equal degree in a standard\r\nsolution of hydriodate of potassa (316.).\r\n\r\n374. When the platina wire was connected with the prime conductor of the\r\nmachine, and the spatula with the discharging train, ten turns of the\r\nmachine had such decomposing power as to produce a pale round spot of\r\niodine of the diameter of the wire; twenty turns made a much darker mark,\r\nand thirty turns made a dark brown spot penetrating to the second thickness\r\nof the paper. The difference in effect produced by two or three turns, more\r\nor less, could be distinguished with facility.\r\n\r\n375. The wire and spatula were then connected with the voltaic apparatus\r\n(369.), the galvanometer being also included in the arrangement; and, a\r\nstronger acid having been prepared, consisting of nitric acid and water,\r\nthe voltaic apparatus was immersed so far as to give a permanent deflection\r\nof the needle to the 5-1/3 division (372.), the fourfold moistened paper\r\nintervening as before[A]. Then by shifting the end of the wire from place\r\nto place upon the test paper, the effect of the current for five, six,\r\nseven, or any number of the beats of the watch (369.) was observed, and\r\ncompared with that of the machine. After alternating and repeating the\r\nexperiments of comparison many times, it was constantly found that this\r\nstandard current of voltaic electricity, continued for eight beats of the\r\nwatch, was equal, in chemical effect, to thirty turns of the machine;\r\ntwenty-eight revolutions of the machine were sensibly too few.\r\n\r\n  [A] Of course the heightened power of the voltaic battery was\r\n  necessary to compensate for the bad conductor now interposed.\r\n\r\n376. Hence it results that both in _magnetic deflection_ (371.) and in\r\n_chemical force_, the current of electricity of the standard voltaic\r\nbattery for eight beats of the watch was equal to that of the machine\r\nevolved by thirty revolutions.\r\n\r\n377. It also follows that for this case of electro-chemical decomposition,\r\nand it is probable for all cases, that the _chemical power, like the\r\nmagnetic force_ (36.), _is in direct proportion to the absolute quantity\r\nof electricity_ which passes.\r\n\r\n378. Hence arises still further confirmation, if any were required, of the\r\nidentity of common and voltaic electricity, and that the differences of\r\nintensity and quantity are quite sufficient to account for what were\r\nsupposed to be their distinctive qualities.\r\n\r\n379. The extension which the present investigations have enabled me to make\r\nof the facts and views constituting the theory of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition, will, with some other points of electrical doctrine, be\r\nalmost immediately submitted to the Royal Society in another series of\r\nthese Researches.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\n15th Dec. 1832._\r\n\r\nNote.--I am anxious, and am permitted, to add to this paper a correction of\r\nan error which I have attributed to M. Ampère the first series of these\r\nExperimental Researches. In referring to his experiment on the induction of\r\nelectrical currents (78.), I have called that a disc which I should have\r\ncalled a circle or a ring. M. Ampère used a ring, or a very short cylinder\r\nmade of a narrow plate of copper bent into a circle, and he tells me that\r\nby such an arrangement the motion is very readily obtained. I have not\r\ndoubted that M. Ampère obtained the motion he described; but merely mistook\r\nthe kind of mobile conductor used, and so far I described his _experiment_\r\nerroneously.\r\n\r\nIn the same paragraph I have stated that M. Ampère says the disc turned \"to\r\ntake a position of equilibrium exactly as the spiral itself would have\r\nturned had it been free to move\"; and further on I have said that my\r\nresults tended to invert the sense of the proposition \"stated by M. Ampère,\r\n_that a current of electricity tends to put the electricity of conductors\r\nnear which it passes in motion in the same direction._\" M. Ampère tells me\r\nin a letter which I have just received from him, that he carefully avoided,\r\nwhen describing the experiment, any reference to the direction of the\r\ninduced current; and on looking at the passages he quotes to me, I find\r\nthat to be the case. I have therefore done him injustice in the above\r\nstatements, and am anxious to correct my error.\r\n\r\nBut that it may not be supposed I lightly wrote those passages, I will\r\nbriefly refer to my reasons for understanding them in the sense I did. At\r\nfirst the experiment failed. When re-made successfully about a year\r\nafterwards, it was at Geneva in company with M.A. De la Rive: the latter\r\nphilosopher described the results[A], and says that the plate of copper\r\nbent into a circle which was used as the mobile conductor \"sometimes\r\nadvanced between the two branches of the (horse-shoe) magnet, and sometimes\r\nwas repelled, _according_ to the direction of the current in the\r\nsurrounding conductors.\"\r\n\r\n  [A] Bibliothèque Universelle, xxi. p. 48.\r\n\r\nI have been in the habit of referring to Demonferrand's _Manuel\r\nd'Electricité Dynamique_, as a book of authority in France; containing the\r\ngeneral results and laws of this branch of science, up to the time of its\r\npublication, in a well arranged form. At p. 173, the author, when\r\ndescribing this experiment, says, \"The mobile circle turns to take a\r\nposition of equilibrium as a conductor would do in which the current moved\r\nin the _same direction_ as in the spiral;\" and in the same paragraph he\r\nadds, \"It is therefore proved _that a current of electricity tends to put\r\nthe electricity of conductors, near which it passes, in motion in the same\r\ndirection._\" These are the words I quoted in my paper (78.).\r\n\r\nLe Lycée of 1st of January, 1832, No. 36, in an article written after the\r\nreceipt of my first unfortunate letter to M. Hachette, and before my papers\r\nwere printed, reasons upon the direction of the induced currents, and says,\r\nthat there ought to be \"an elementary current produced in the same\r\ndirection as the corresponding portion of the producing current.\" A little\r\nfurther on it says, \"therefore we ought to obtain currents, moving in the\r\n_same direction_, produced upon a metallic wire, either by a magnet or a\r\ncurrent. M. Ampère _was so thouroughly persuaded that such ought to be the\r\ndirection of the currents by influence_, that he neglected to assure\r\nhimself of it in his experiment at Geneva.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the precise statements in Demonferrand's Manuel, agreeing as they\r\ndid with the expression in M. De la Rive's paper, (which, however, I now\r\nunderstand as only meaning that when the inducing current was changed, the\r\nmotion of the mobile circle changed also,) and not in discordance with\r\nanything expressed by M. Ampère himself where he speaks of the experiment,\r\nwhich made me conclude, when I wrote the paper, that what I wrote was\r\nreally his avowed opinion; and when the Number of the Lycée referred to\r\nappeared, which was before my paper was printed, it could excite no\r\nsuspicion that I was in error.\r\n\r\nHence the mistake into which I unwittingly fell. I am proud to correct it\r\nand do full justice to the acuteness and accuracy which, as far as I can\r\nunderstand the subjects, M. Ampère carries into all the branches of\r\nphilosophy which he investigates.\r\n\r\nFinally, my note to (79.) says that the Lycée, No. 36. \"mistakes the\r\nerroneous results of MM. Fresnel and Ampère for true ones,\" &c. &c. In\r\ncalling M. Ampère's results erroneous, I spoke of the results described in,\r\nand referred to by the Lycée itself; but _now_ that the expression of the\r\ndirection of the induced current is to be separated, the term _erroneous_\r\nought no longer to be attached to them.\r\n\r\nApril 29, 1833.\r\nM.F.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. _On a new Law of Electric Conduction._ § 10. _On Conducting Power\r\ngenerally._\r\n\r\nReceived April 24,--Read May 23, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. _On a new Law of Electric Conduction._[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] In reference to this law see further considerations at 910. 1358.\r\n  1705.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n380. It was during the progress of investigations relating to\r\nelectro-chemical decomposition, which I still have to submit to the Royal\r\nSociety, that I encountered effects due to a very _general law_ of electric\r\nconduction not hitherto recognised; and though they prevented me from\r\nobtaining the condition I sought for, they afforded abundant compensation\r\nfor the momentary disappointment, by the new and important interest which\r\nthey gave to an extensive part of electrical science.\r\n\r\n381. I was working with ice, and the solids resulting from the freezing of\r\nsolutions, arranged either as barriers across a substance to be decomposed,\r\nor as the actual poles of a voltaic battery, that I might trace and catch\r\ncertain elements in their transit, when I was suddenly stopped in my\r\nprogress by finding that ice was in such circumstances a non-conductor of\r\nelectricity; and that as soon as a thin film of it was interposed, in the\r\ncircuit of a very powerful voltaic battery, the transmission of electricity\r\nwas prevented, and all decomposition ceased.\r\n\r\n382. At first the experiments were made with common ice, during the cold\r\nfreezing weather of the latter end of January 1833; but the results were\r\nfallacious, from the imperfection of the arrangements, and the following\r\nmore unexceptionable form of experiment was adopted.\r\n\r\n383. Tin vessels were formed, five inches deep, one inch and a quarter wide\r\nin one direction, of different widths from three eighths to five eighths of\r\nan inch in the other, and open at one extremity. Into these were fixed by\r\ncorks, plates of platina, so that the latter should not touch the tin\r\ncases; and copper wires having previously been soldered to the plate, these\r\nwere easily connected, when required, with a voltaic pile. Then distilled\r\nwater, previously boiled for three hours, was poured into the vessels, and\r\nfrozen by a mixture of salt and snow, so that pure transparent solid ice\r\nintervened between the platina and tin; and finally these metals were\r\nconnected with the opposite extremities of the voltaic apparatus, a\r\ngalvanometer being at the same time included in the circuit.\r\n\r\n384. In the first experiment, the platina pole was three inches and a half\r\nlong, and seven eighths of an inch wide; it was wholly immersed in the\r\nwater or ice, and as the vessel was four eighths of an inch in width, the\r\naverage thickness of the intervening ice was only a quarter of an inch,\r\nwhilst the surface of contact with it at both poles was nearly fourteen\r\nsquare inches. After the water was frozen, the vessel was still retained in\r\nthe frigorific mixture, whilst contact between the tin and platina\r\nrespectively was made with the extremities of a well-charged voltaic\r\nbattery, consisting of twenty pairs of four-inch plates, each with double\r\ncoppers. Not the slightest deflection of the galvanometer needle occurred.\r\n\r\n385. On taking the frozen arrangement out of the cold mixture, and applying\r\nwarmth to the bottom of the tin case, so as to melt part of the ice, the\r\nconnexion with the battery being in the mean time retained, the needle did\r\nnot at first move; and it was only when the thawing process had extended so\r\nfar as to liquefy part of the ice touching the platina pole, that\r\nconduction took place; but then it occurred effectually, and the\r\ngalvanometer needle was permanently deflected nearly 70°.\r\n\r\n386. In another experiment, a platina spatula, five inches in length and\r\nseven eighths of an inch in width, had four inches fixed in the ice, and\r\nthe latter was only three sixteenths of an inch thick between one metallic\r\nsurface and the other; yet this arrangement insulated as perfectly as the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n387. Upon pouring a little water in at the top of this vessel on the ice,\r\nstill the arrangement did not conduct; yet fluid water was evidently there.\r\nThis result was the consequence of the cold metals having frozen the water\r\nwhere they touched it, and thus insulating the fluid part; and it well\r\nillustrates the non-conducting power of ice, by showing how thin a film\r\ncould prevent the transmission of the battery current. Upon thawing parts\r\nof this thin film, at _both_ metals, conduction occurred.\r\n\r\n388. Upon warming the tin case and removing the piece of ice, it was found\r\nthat a cork having slipped, one of the edges of the platina had been all\r\nbut in contact with the inner surface of the tin vessel; yet,\r\nnotwithstanding the extreme thinness of the interfering ice in this place,\r\nno sensible portion of electricity had passed.\r\n\r\n389. These experiments were repeated many times with the same results. At\r\nlast a battery of fifteen troughs, or one hundred and fifty pairs of\r\nfour-inch plates, powerfully charged, was used; yet even here no sensible\r\nquantity of electricity passed the thin barrier of ice.\r\n\r\n390. It seemed at first as if occasional departures from these effects\r\noccurred; but they could always be traced to some interfering\r\ncircumstances. The water should in every instance be well-frozen; for\r\nthough it is not necessary that the ice should reach from pole to pole,\r\nsince a barrier of it about one pole would be quite sufficient to prevent\r\nconduction, yet, if part remain fluid, the mere necessary exposure of the\r\napparatus to the air or the approximation of the hands, is sufficient to\r\nproduce, at the _upper surface_ of the water and ice, a film of fluid,\r\nextending from the platina to the tin; and then conduction occurs. Again,\r\nif the corks used to block the platina in its place are damp or wet within,\r\nit is necessary that the cold be sufficiently well applied to freeze the\r\nwater in them, or else when the surfaces of their contact with the tin\r\nbecome slightly warm by handling, that part will conduct, and the interior\r\nbeing ready to conduct also, the current will pass. The water should be\r\npure, not only that unembarrassed results may be obtained, but also that,\r\nas the freezing proceeds, a minute portion of concentrated saline solution\r\nmay not be formed, which remaining fluid, and being interposed in the ice,\r\nor passing into cracks resulting from contraction, may exhibit conducting\r\npowers independent of the ice itself.\r\n\r\n391. On one occasion I was surprised to find that after thawing much of the\r\nice the conducting power had not been restored; but I found that a cork\r\nwhich held the wire just where it joined the platina, dipped so far into\r\nthe ice, that with the ice itself it protected the platina from contact\r\nwith the melted part long after that contact was expected.\r\n\r\n392. This insulating power of ice is not effective with electricity of\r\nexalted intensity. On touching a diverged gold-leaf electrometer with a\r\nwire connected with the platina, whilst the tin case was touched by the\r\nhand or another wire, the electrometer was instantly discharged (419.).\r\n\r\n393. But though electricity of an intensity so low that it cannot diverge\r\nthe electrometer, can still pass (though in very limited quantities\r\n(419.),) through ice; the comparative relation of water and ice to the\r\nelectricity of the voltaic apparatus is not less extraordinary on that\r\naccount, Or less important in its consequences.\r\n\r\n394. As it did not seem likely that this _law of the assumption of\r\nconducting power during liquefaction, and loss of it during congelation_,\r\nwould be peculiar to water, I immediately proceeded to ascertain its\r\ninfluence in other cases, and found it to be very general. For this purpose\r\nbodies were chosen which were solid at common temperatures, but readily\r\nfusible; and of such composition as, for other reasons connected with\r\nelectrochemical action, led to the conclusion that they would be able when\r\nfused to replace water as conductors. A voltaic battery of two troughs, or\r\ntwenty pairs of four-inch plates (384.), was used as the source of\r\nelectricity, and a galvanometer introduced into the circuit to indicate the\r\npresence or absence of a current.\r\n\r\n395. On fusing a little chloride of lead by a spirit lamp on a fragment of\r\na Florence flask, and introducing two platina wires connected with the\r\npoles of the battery, there was instantly powerful action, the galvanometer\r\nwas most violently affected, and the chloride rapidly decomposed. On\r\nremoving the lamp, the instant the chloride solidified all current and\r\nconsequent effects ceased, though the platina wires remained inclosed in\r\nthe chloride not more than the one-sixteenth of an inch from each other. On\r\nrenewing the heat, as soon as the fusion had proceeded far enough to allow\r\nliquid matter to connect the poles, the electrical current instantly\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n396. On fusing the chloride, with one wire introduced, and then touching\r\nthe liquid with the other, the latter being cold, caused a little knob to\r\nconcrete on its extremity, and no current passed; it was only when the wire\r\nbecame so hot as to be able to admit or allow of contact with the liquid\r\nmatter, that conduction took place, and then it was very powerful.\r\n\r\n397. When chloride of silver and chlorate of potassa were experimented\r\nwith, in a similar manner, exactly the same results occurred.\r\n\r\n398. Whenever the current passed in these cases, there was decomposition of\r\nthe substances; but the electro-chemical part of this subject I purpose\r\nconnecting with more general views in a future paper[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In 1801, Sir H. Davy knew that \"dry nitre, caustic potash, and\r\n  soda are conductors of galvanism when rendered fluid by a high degree\r\n  of heat,\" (Journals of the Royal Institution, 1802, p. 53,) but was\r\n  not aware of the general law which I have been engaged in developing.\r\n  It is remarkable, that eleven years after that, he should say, \"There\r\n  are no fluids known except such as contain water, which are capable of\r\n  being made the medium of connexion between the metal or metals of the\r\n  voltaic apparatus.\"--Elements of Chemical Philosophy, p. 169.\r\n\r\n399. Other substances, which could not be melted on glass, were fused by\r\nthe lamp and blowpipe on platina connected with one pole of the battery,\r\nand then a wire, connected with the other, dipped into them. In this way\r\nchloride of sodium, sulphate of soda, protoxide of lead, mixed carbonates\r\nof potash and soda, &c. &c., exhibited exactly the same phenomena as those\r\nalready described: whilst liquid, they conducted and were decomposed;\r\nwhilst solid, though very hot, they insulated the battery current even when\r\nfour troughs were used.\r\n\r\n400. Occasionally the substances were contained in small bent tubes of\r\ngreen glass, and when fused, the platina poles introduced, one on each\r\nside. In such cases the same general results as those already described\r\nwere procured; but a further advantage was obtained, namely, that whilst\r\nthe substance was conducting and suffering decomposition, the final\r\narrangement of the elements could be observed. Thus, iodides of potassium\r\nand lead gave iodine at the positive pole, and potassium or lead at the\r\nnegative pole. Chlorides of lead and silver gave chlorine at the positive,\r\nand metals at the negative pole. Nitre and chlorate; of potassa gave\r\noxygen, &c., at the positive, and alkali, or even potassium, at the\r\nnegative pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n401. A fourth arrangement was used for substances requiring very high\r\ntemperatures for their fusion. A platina wire was connected with one pole\r\nof the battery; its extremity bent into a small ring, in the manner\r\ndescribed by Berzelius, for blowpipe experiments; a little of the salt,\r\nglass, or other substance, was melted on this ring by the ordinary\r\nblowpipe, or even in some cases by the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, and when the\r\ndrop, retained in its place by the ring, was thoroughly hot and fluid, a\r\nplatina wire from the opposite pole of the battery was made to touch it,\r\nand the effects observed.\r\n\r\n402. The following are various substances, taken from very different\r\nclasses chemically considered, which are subject to this law. The list\r\nmight, no doubt, be enormously extended; but I have not had time to do more\r\nthan confirm the law by a sufficient number of instances.\r\n\r\nFirst, _water_.\r\n\r\nAmongst _oxides_;--potassa, protoxide of lead, glass of antimony, protoxide\r\nof antimony, oxide of bismuth.\r\n\r\n_Chlorides_ of potassium, sodium, barium, strontium, calcium, magnesium,\r\nmanganese, zinc, copper (proto-), lead, tin (proto-), antimony, silver.\r\n\r\n_Iodides_ of potassium, zinc and lead, protiodide of tin, periodide of\r\nmercury; _fluoride_ of potassium; _cyanide_ of potassium; _sulpho-cyanide_\r\nof potassium.\r\n\r\n_Salts._ Chlorate of potassa; nitrates of potassa, soda, baryta, strontia,\r\nlead, copper, and silver; sulphates of soda and lead, proto-sulphate of\r\nmercury; phosphates of potassa, soda, lead, copper, phosphoric glass or\r\nacid phosphate of lime; carbonates of potassa and soda, mingled and\r\nseparate; borax, borate of lead, per-borate of tin; chromate of potassa,\r\nbi-chromate of potassa, chromate of lead; acetate of potassa.\r\n\r\n_Sulphurets._ Sulphuret of antimony, sulphuret of potassium made by\r\nreducing sulphate of potassa by hydrogen; ordinary sulphuret of potassa.\r\n\r\nSilicated potassa; chameleon mineral.\r\n\r\n403. It is highly interesting in the instances of those substances which\r\nsoften before they liquefy, to observe at what period the conducting power\r\nis acquired, and to what degree it is exalted by perfect fluidity. Thus,\r\nwith the borate of lead, when heated by the lamp upon glass, it becomes as\r\nsoft as treacle, but it did not conduct, and it was only when urged by the\r\nblowpipe and brought to a fair red heat, that it conducted. When rendered\r\nquite liquid, it conducted with extreme facility.\r\n\r\n404. I do not mean to deny that part of the increased conducting power in\r\nthese cases of softening was probably due to the elevation of temperature\r\n(432. 445.); but I have no doubt that by far the greater part was due to\r\nthe influence of the general law already demonstrated, and which in these\r\ninstances came gradually, instead of suddenly, into operation.\r\n\r\n405. The following are bodies which acquired no conducting power upon\r\nassuming the liquid state:--\r\n\r\nSulphur, phosphorus; iodide of sulphur, per-iodide of tin; orpiment,\r\nrealgar; glacial acetic acid, mixed margaric and oleic acids, artificial\r\ncamphor; caffeine, sugar, adipocire, stearine of cocoa-nut oil, spermaceti,\r\ncamphor, naphthaline, resin, gum sandarach, shell lac.\r\n\r\n406. Perchloride of tin, chloride of arsenic, and the hydrated chloride of\r\narsenic, being liquids, had no sensible conducting power indicated by the\r\ngalvanometer, nor were they decomposed.\r\n\r\n407. Some of the above substances are sufficiently remarkable as exceptions\r\nto the general law governing the former cases. These are orpiment, realgar,\r\nacetic acid, artificial camphor, per-iodide of tin, and the chlorides of\r\ntin and arsenic. I shall have occasion to refer to these cases in the paper\r\non Electro-chemical Decomposition.\r\n\r\n408. Boracic acid was raised to the highest possible temperature by an\r\noxy-hydrogen flame (401.), yet it gained no conducting powers sufficient to\r\naffect the galvanometer, and underwent no apparent voltaic decomposition.\r\nIt seemed to be quite as bad a conductor as air. Green bottle-glass, heated\r\nin the same manner, did not gain conducting power sensible to the\r\ngalvanometer. Flint glass, when highly heated, did conduct a little and\r\ndecompose; and as the proportion of potash or oxide of lead was increased\r\nin the glass, the effects were more powerful. Those glasses, consisting of\r\nboracic acid on the one hand, and oxide of lead or potassa on the other,\r\nshow the assumption of conducting power upon fusion and the accompanying\r\ndecomposition very well.\r\n\r\n409. I was very anxious to try the general experiment with sulphuric acid,\r\nof about specific gravity 1.783, containing that proportion of water which\r\ngives it the power of crystallizing at 40° Fahr.; but I found it impossible\r\nto obtain it so that I could be sure the whole would congeal even at 0°\r\nFahr. A ten-thousandth part of water, more or less than necessary, would,\r\nupon cooling the whole, cause a portion of uncongealable liquid to\r\nseparate, and that remaining in the interstices of the solid mass, and\r\nmoistening the planes of division, would prevent the correct observation of\r\nthe phenomena due to entire solidification and subsequent liquefaction.\r\n\r\n410. With regard to the substances on which conducting power is thus\r\nconferred by liquidity, the degree of power so given is generally very\r\ngreat. Water is that body in which this acquired power is feeblest. In the\r\nvarious oxides, chlorides, salts, &c. &c., it is given in a much higher\r\ndegree. I have not had time to measure the conducting power in these cases,\r\nbut it is apparently some hundred times that of pure water. The increased\r\nconducting power known to be given to water by the addition of salts, would\r\nseem to be in a great degree dependent upon the high conducting power of\r\nthese bodies when in the liquid state, that state being given them for the\r\ntime, not by heat but solution in the water[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See a doubt on this point at 1356.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n411. Whether the conducting power of these liquefied bodies is a\r\nconsequence of their decomposition or not (413.), or whether the two\r\nactions of conduction and decomposition are essentially connected or not,\r\nwould introduce no difference affecting the probable accuracy of the\r\npreceding statement.\r\n\r\n412. This _general assumption of conducting power_ by bodies as soon as\r\nthey pass from the solid to the liquid state, offers a new and\r\nextraordinary character, the existence of which, as far as I know, has not\r\nbefore been suspected; and it seems importantly connected with some\r\nproperties and relations of the particles of matter which I may now briefly\r\npoint out.\r\n\r\n413. In almost all the instances, as yet observed, which are governed by\r\nthis law, the substances experimented with have been those which were not\r\nonly compound bodies, but such as contain elements known to arrange\r\nthemselves at the opposite poles; and were also such as could be\r\n_decomposed_ by the electrical current. When conduction took place,\r\ndecomposition occurred; when decomposition ceased, conduction ceased also;\r\nand it becomes a fair and an important question, Whether the conduction\r\nitself may not, wherever the law holds good, be a consequence not merely of\r\nthe capability, but of the act of decomposition? And that question may be\r\naccompanied by another, namely, Whether solidification does not prevent\r\nconduction, merely by chaining the particles to their places, under the\r\ninfluence of aggregation, and preventing their final separation in the\r\nmanner necessary for decomposition?\r\n\r\n414. But, on the other hand, there is one substance (and others may occur),\r\nthe _per-iodide of mercury_, which, being experimented with like the others\r\n(400.), was found to insulate when solid, and to acquire conducting power\r\nwhen fluid; yet it did not seem to undergo decomposition in the latter\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n415. Again, there are many substances which contain elements such as would\r\nbe expected to arrange themselves at the opposite poles of the pile, and\r\ntherefore in that respect fitted for decomposition, which yet do not\r\nconduct. Amongst these are the iodide of sulphur, per-iodide of zinc,\r\nper-chloride of tin, chloride of arsenic, hydrated chloride of arsenic,\r\nacetic acid, orpiment, realgar, artificial camphor, &c.; and from these it\r\nmight perhaps be assumed that decomposition is dependent upon conducting\r\npower, and not the latter upon the former. The true relation, however, of\r\nconduction and decomposition in those bodies governed by the general law\r\nwhich it is the object of this paper to establish, can only be\r\nsatisfactorily made out from a far more extensive series of observations\r\nthan those I have yet been able to supply[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See 673, &c. &c.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n416. The relation, under this law, of the conducting power for electricity\r\nto that for heat, is very remarkable, and seems to imply a natural\r\ndependence of the two. As the solid becomes a fluid, it loses almost\r\nentirely the power of conduction for heat, but gains in a high degree that\r\nfor electricity; but as it reverts hack to the solid state, it gains the\r\npower of conducting heat, and loses that of conducting electricity. If,\r\ntherefore, the properties are not incompatible, still they are most\r\nstrongly contrasted, one being lost as the other is gained. We may hope,\r\nperhaps, hereafter to understand the physical reason of this very\r\nextraordinary relation of the two conducting powers, both of which appear\r\nto be directly connected with the corpuscular condition of the substances\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n417. The assumption of conducting power and a decomposable condition by\r\nliquefaction, promises new opportunities of, and great facilities in,\r\nvoltaic decomposition. Thus, such bodies as the oxides, chlorides,\r\ncyanides, sulpho-cyanides, fluorides, certain vitreous mixtures, &c. &c.,\r\nmay be submitted to the action of the voltaic battery under new\r\ncircumstances; and indeed I have already been able, with ten pairs of\r\nplates, to decompose common salt, chloride of magnesium, borax, &c. &c.,\r\nand to obtain sodium, magnesium, boron, &c., in their separate states.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. _On Conducting Power generally._[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] In reference to this § refer to 983 in series viii., and the\r\n  results connected with it.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n418. It is not my intention here to enter into an examination of all the\r\ncircumstances connected with conducting power, but to record certain facts\r\nand observations which have arisen during recent inquiries, as additions to\r\nthe general stock of knowledge relating to this point of electrical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n419. I was anxious, in the first place, to obtain some idea of the\r\nconducting power of ice and solid salts for electricity of high tension\r\n(392.), that a comparison might be made between it and the large accession\r\nof the same power gained upon liquefaction. For this purpose the large\r\nelectrical machine (290.) was brought into excellent action, its conductor\r\nconnected with a delicate gold-leaf electrometer, and also with the platina\r\ninclosed in the ice (383.), whilst the tin case was connected with the\r\ndischarging train (292.). On working the machine moderately, the gold\r\nleaves barely separated; on working it rapidly, they could be opened nearly\r\ntwo inches. In this instance the tin case was five-eighths of an inch in\r\nwidth; and as, after the experiment, the platina plate was found very\r\nnearly in the middle of the ice, the average thickness of the latter had\r\nbeen five-sixteenths of an inch, and the extent of surface of contact with\r\ntin and platina fourteen square inches (384.). Yet, under these\r\ncircumstances, it was but just able to conduct the small quantity of\r\nelectricity which this machine could evolve (371.), even when of a tension\r\ncompetent to open the leaves two inches; no wonder, therefore, that it\r\ncould not conduct any sensible portion of the electricity of the troughs\r\n(384.), which, though almost infinitely surpassing that of the machine in\r\nquantity, had a tension so low as not to be sensible to an electrometer.\r\n\r\n420. In another experiment, the tin case was only four-eighths of an inch\r\nin width, and it was found afterwards that the platina had been not quite\r\none-eighth of an inch distant in the ice from one side of the tin vessel.\r\nWhen this was introduced into the course of the electricity from the\r\nmachine (419.), the gold leaves could be opened, but not more than half an\r\ninch; the thinness of the ice favouring the conduction of the electricity,\r\nand permitting the same quantity to pass in the same time, though of a much\r\nlower tension.\r\n\r\n421. Iodide of potassium which had been fused and cooled was introduced\r\ninto the course of the electricity from the machine. There were two pieces,\r\neach about a quarter of an inch in thickness, and exposing a surface on\r\neach side equal to about half a square inch; these were placed upon platina\r\nplates, one connected with the machine and electrometer (419.), and the\r\nother with the discharging train, whilst a fine platina wire connected the\r\ntwo pieces, resting upon them by its two points. On working the electrical\r\nmachine, it was possible to open the electrometer leaves about two-thirds\r\nof an inch.\r\n\r\n422. As the platina wire touched only by points, the facts show that this\r\nsalt is a far better conductor than ice; but as the leaves of the\r\nelectrometer opened, it is also evident with what difficulty conduction,\r\neven of the small portion of electricity produced by the machine, is\r\neffected by this body in the solid state, when compared to the facility\r\nwith which enormous quantities at very low tensions are transmitted by it\r\nwhen in the fluid state.\r\n\r\n423. In order to confirm these results by others, obtained from the voltaic\r\napparatus, a battery of one hundred and fifty plates, four inches square,\r\nwas well-charged: its action was good; the shock from it strong; the\r\ndischarge would _continue_ from copper to copper through four-tenths of an\r\ninch of air, and the gold-leaf electrometer before used could be opened\r\nnearly a quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\n424. The ice vessel employed (420.) was half an inch in width; as the\r\nextent of contact of the ice with the tin and platina was nearly fourteen\r\nsquare inches, the whole was equivalent to a plate of ice having a surface\r\nof seven square inches, of perfect contact at each side, and only one\r\nfourth of an inch thick. It was retained in a freezing mixture during the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n425. The order of arrangement in the course of the electric current was as\r\nfollows. The positive pole of the battery was connected by a wire with the\r\nplatina plate in the ice; the plate was in contact with the ice, the ice\r\nwith the tin jacket, the jacket with a wire, which communicated with a\r\npiece of tin foil, on which rested one end of a bent platina wire (312.),\r\nthe other or decomposing end being supported on paper moistened with\r\nsolution of iodide of potassium (316.): the paper was laid flat on a\r\nplatina spatula connected with the negative end of the battery. All that\r\npart of the arrangement between the ice vessel and the decomposing wire\r\npoint, including both these, was insulated, so that no electricity might\r\npass through the latter which had not traversed the former also.\r\n\r\n426. Under these circumstances, it was found that, a pale brown spot of\r\niodine was slowly formed under the decomposing platina point, thus\r\nindicating that ice could conduct a little of the electricity evolved by a\r\nvoltaic battery charged up to the degree of intensity indicated by the\r\nelectrometer. But it is quite evident that notwithstanding the enormous\r\nquantity of electricity which the battery could furnish, it was, under\r\npresent circumstances, a very inferior instrument to the ordinary machine;\r\nfor the latter could send as much through the ice as it could carry, being\r\nof a far higher intensity, i.e. able to open the electrometer leaves half\r\nan inch or more (419. 420.).\r\n\r\n427. The decomposing wire and solution of iodide of potassium were then\r\nremoved, and replaced by a very delicate galvanometer (205.); it was so\r\nnearly astatic, that it vibrated to and fro in about sixty-three beats of a\r\nwatch giving one hundred and fifty beats in a minute. The same feebleness\r\nof current as before was still indicated; the galvanometer needle was\r\ndeflected, but it required to break and make contact three or four times\r\n(297.), before the effect was decided.\r\n\r\n428. The galvanometer being removed, two platina plates were connected with\r\nthe extremities of the wires, and the tongue placed between them, so that\r\nthe whole charge of the battery, so far as the ice would let it pass, was\r\nfree to go through the tongue. Whilst standing on the stone floor, there\r\nwas shock, &c., but when insulated, I could feel no sensation. I think a\r\nfrog would have been scarcely, if at all, affected.\r\n\r\n429. The ice was now removed, and experiments made with other solid bodies,\r\nfor which purpose they were placed under the end of the decomposing wire\r\ninstead of the solution of iodide of potassium (125.). For instance, a\r\npiece of dry iodide of potassium was placed on the spatula connected with\r\nthe negative pole of the battery, and the point of the decomposing wire\r\nplaced upon it, whilst the positive end of the battery communicated with\r\nthe latter. A brown spot of iodine very slowly appeared, indicating the\r\npassage of a little electricity, and agreeing in that respect with the\r\nresults obtained by the use of the electrical machine (421.). When the\r\ngalvanometer was introduced into the circuit at the same time with the\r\niodide, it was with difficulty that the action of the current on it could\r\nbe rendered sensible.\r\n\r\n430. A piece of common salt previously fused and solidified being\r\nintroduced into the circuit was sufficient almost entirely to destroy the\r\naction on the galvanometer. Fused and cooled chloride of lead produced the\r\nsame effect. The conducting power of these bodies, _when fluid_, is very\r\ngreat (395. 402.).\r\n\r\n431. These effects, produced by using the common machine and the voltaic\r\nbattery, agree therefore with each other, and with the law laid down in\r\nthis paper (394.); and also with the opinion I have supported, in the Third\r\nSeries of these Researches, of the identity of electricity derived from\r\ndifferent sources (360.).\r\n\r\n432. The effect of heat in increasing the conducting power of many\r\nsubstances, especially for electricity of high tension, is well known. I\r\nhave lately met with an extraordinary case of this kind, for electricity of\r\nlow tension, or that of the voltaic pile, and which is in direct contrast\r\nwith the influence of heat upon metallic bodies, as observed and described\r\nby Sir Humphry Davy[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1821, p. 131.\r\n\r\n433. The substance presenting this effect is sulphuret of silver. It was\r\nmade by fusing a mixture of precipitated silver and sublimed sulphur,\r\nremoving the film of silver by a file from the exterior of the fused mass,\r\npulverizing the sulphuret, mingling it with more sulphur, and fusing it\r\nagain in a green glass tube, so that no air should obtain access during the\r\nprocess. The surface of the sulphuret being again removed by a file or\r\nknife, it was considered quite free from uncombined silver.\r\n\r\n434. When a piece of this sulphuret, half an inch in thickness, was put\r\nbetween surfaces of platina, terminating the poles of a voltaic battery of\r\ntwenty pairs of four-inch plates, a galvanometer being also included in the\r\ncircuit, the needle was slightly deflected, indicating a feeble conducting\r\npower. On pressing the platina poles and sulphuret together with the\r\nfingers, the conducting power increased as the whole became warm. On\r\napplying a lamp under the sulphuret between the poles, the conducting power\r\nrose rapidly with the heat, and at last-the galvanometer needle jumped into\r\na fixed position, and the sulphuret was found conducting in the manner of a\r\nmetal. On removing the lamp and allowing the heat to fall, the effects were\r\nreversed, the needle at first began to vibrate a little, then gradually\r\nleft its transverse direction, and at last returned to a position very\r\nnearly that which it would take when no current was passing through the\r\ngalvanometer.\r\n\r\n435. Occasionally, when the contact of the sulphuret with the platina poles\r\nwas good, the battery freshly charged, and the commencing temperature not\r\ntoo low, the mere current of electricity from the battery was sufficient to\r\nraise the temperature of the sulphuret; and then, without any application\r\nof extraneous heat, it went on increasing conjointly in temperature and\r\nconducting power, until the cooling influence of the air limited the\r\neffects. In such cases it was generally necessary to cool the whole\r\npurposely, to show the returning series of phenomena.\r\n\r\n436. Occasionally, also, the effects would sink of themselves, and could\r\nnot be renewed until a fresh surface of the sulphuret had been applied to\r\nthe positive pole. This was in consequence of peculiar results of\r\ndecomposition, to which I shall have occasion to revert in the section on\r\nElectro-chemical Decomposition, and was conveniently avoided by inserting\r\nthe ends of two pieces of platina wire into the opposite extremities of a\r\nportion of sulphuret fused in a glass tube, and placing this arrangement\r\nbetween the poles of the battery.\r\n\r\n437. The hot sulphuret of silver conducts sufficiently well to give a\r\nbright spark with charcoal, &c. &c., in the manner of a metal.\r\n\r\n438. The native grey sulphuret of silver, and the ruby silver ore, both\r\npresented the same phenomena. The native malleable sulphuret of silver\r\npresented precisely the same appearances as the artificial sulphuret.\r\n\r\n439. There is no other body with which I am acquainted, that, like\r\nsulphuret of silver, can compare with metals in conducting power for\r\nelectricity of low tension when hot, but which, unlike them, during\r\ncooling, loses in power, whilst they, on the contrary, gain. Probably,\r\nhowever, many others may, when sought for, be found[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See now on this subject, 1340, 1341.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n440. The proto-sulphuret of iron, the native per-sulphuret of iron,\r\narsenical sulphuret of iron, native yellow sulphuret of copper and iron,\r\ngrey artificial sulphuret of copper, artificial sulphuret of bismuth, and\r\nartificial grey sulphuret of tin, all conduct the voltaic battery current\r\nwhen cold, more or less, some giving sparks like the metals, others not\r\nbeing sufficient for that high effect. They did not seem to conduct better\r\nwhen heated, than before; but I had not time to enter accurately into the\r\ninvestigation of this point. Almost all of them became much heated by the\r\ntransmission of the current, and present some very interesting phenomena in\r\nthat respect. The sulphuret of antimony does not conduct the same current\r\nsensibly either hot or cold, but is amongst those bodies acquiring\r\nconducting power when fused (402.). The sulphuret of silver and perhaps\r\nsome others decompose whilst in the solid state; but the phenomena of this\r\ndecomposition will be reserved for its proper place in the next series of\r\nthese Researches.\r\n\r\n441. Notwithstanding the extreme dissimilarity between sulphuret of silver\r\nand gases or vapours, I cannot help suspecting the action of heat upon them\r\nto be the same, bringing them all into the same class as conductors of\r\nelectricity, although with those great differences in degree, which are\r\nfound to exist under common circumstances. When gases are heated, they\r\nincrease in conducting power, both for common and voltaic electricity\r\n(271.); and it is probable that if we could compress and condense them at\r\nthe same time, we should still further increase their conducting power.\r\nCagniard de la Tour has shown that a substance, for instance water, may be\r\nso expanded by heat whilst in the liquid state, or condensed whilst in the\r\nvaporous state, that the two states shall coincide at one point, and the\r\ntransition from one to the other be so gradual that no line of demarcation\r\ncan be pointed out[A]; that, in fact, the two states shall become\r\none;--which one state presents us at different times with differences in\r\ndegree as to certain properties and relations; and which differences are,\r\nunder ordinary circumstances, so great as to be equivalent to two different\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, xxi. pp. 127, 178.\r\n\r\n442. I cannot but suppose at present that at that point where the liquid\r\nand the gaseous state coincide, the conducting properties are the same for\r\nboth; but that they diminish as the expansion of the matter into a rarer\r\nform takes place by the removal of the necessary pressure; still, however,\r\nretaining, as might be expected, the capability of having what feeble\r\nconducting power remains, increased by the action of heat.\r\n\r\n443. I venture to give the following summary of the conditions of electric\r\nconduction in bodies, not however without fearing that I may have omitted\r\nsome important points[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See now in relation to this subject, 1320--1242.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n444. All bodies conduct electricity in the same manner from metals to lac\r\nand gases, but in very different degrees.\r\n\r\n445. Conducting power is in some bodies powerfully increased by heat, and\r\nin others diminished, yet without our perceiving any accompanying essential\r\nelectrical difference, either in the bodies or in the changes occasioned by\r\nthe electricity conducted.\r\n\r\n446. A numerous class of bodies, insulating electricity of low intensity,\r\nwhen solid, conduct it very freely when fluid, and are then decomposed by\r\nit.\r\n\r\n447. But there are many fluid bodies which do not sensibly conduct\r\nelectricity of this low intensity; there are some which conduct it and are\r\nnot decomposed; nor is fluidity essential to decomposition[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See the next series of these Experimental Researches.\r\n\r\n448. There is but one body yet discovered[A] which, insulating a voltaic\r\ncurrent when solid, and conducting it when fluid, is not decomposed in the\r\nlatter case (414.).\r\n\r\n  [A] It is just possible that this case may, by more delicate\r\n  experiment, hereafter disappear. (See now, 1340, 1341, in relation to\r\n  this note.--_Dec. 1838._)\r\n\r\n449. There is no strict electrical distinction of conduction which can, as\r\nyet, be drawn between bodies supposed to be elementary, and those known to\r\nbe compounds.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nApril 15, 1833_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. _On Electro-chemical Decomposition._ ¶ i. _New conditions of\r\nElectro-chemical Decomposition._ ¶ ii. _Influence of Water in\r\nElectro-chemical Decomposition._ ¶ iii. _Theory of Electro-chemical\r\nDecomposition._\r\n\r\nReceived June 18,--Read June 20, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. _On Electro-chemical Decomposition._[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] Refer to the note after 1047, Series viii.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n450. I have in a recent series of these Researches (265.) proved (to my own\r\nsatisfaction, at least,) the identity of electricities derived from\r\ndifferent sources, and have especially dwelt upon the proofs of the\r\nsameness of those obtained by the use of the common electrical machine and\r\nthe voltaic battery.\r\n\r\n451. The great distinction of the electricities obtained from these two\r\nsources is the very high tension to which the small quantity obtained by\r\naid of the machine may be raised, and the enormous quantity (371. 376.) in\r\nwhich that of comparatively low tension, supplied by the voltaic battery,\r\nmay be procured; but as their actions, whether magnetical, chemical, or of\r\nany other nature, are essentially the same (360.), it appeared evident that\r\nwe might reason from the former as to the manner of action of the latter;\r\nand it was, to me, a probable consequence, that the use of electricity of\r\nsuch intensity as that afforded by the machine, would, when applied to\r\neffect and elucidate electro-chemical decomposition, show some new\r\nconditions of that action, evolve new views of the internal arrangements\r\nand changes of the substances under decomposition, and perhaps give\r\nefficient powers over matter as yet undecomposed.\r\n\r\n452. For the purpose of rendering the bearings of the different parts of\r\nthis series of researches more distinct, I shall divide it into several\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ i. _New conditions of Electro-chemical Decomposition._\r\n\r\n453. The tension of machine electricity causes it, however small in\r\nquantity, to pass through any length of water, solutions, or other\r\nsubstances classing with these as conductors, as fast as it can be\r\nproduced, and therefore, in relation to quantity, as fast as it could have\r\npassed through much shorter portions of the same conducting substance. With\r\nthe voltaic battery the case is very different, and the passing current of\r\nelectricity supplied by it suffers serious diminution in any substance, by\r\nconsiderable extension of its length, but especially in such bodies as\r\nthose mentioned above.\r\n\r\n454. I endeavoured to apply this facility of transmitting the current of\r\nelectricity through any length of a conductor, to an investigation of the\r\ntransfer of the elements in a decomposing body, in contrary directions,\r\ntowards the poles. The general form of apparatus used in these experiments\r\nhas been already described (312. 316); and also a particular experiment\r\n(319.), in which, when a piece of litmus paper and a piece of turmeric\r\npaper were combined and moistened in solution of sulphate of soda, the\r\npoint of the wire from the machine (representing the positive pole) put\r\nupon the litmus paper, and the receiving point from the discharging train\r\n(292. 316.), representing the negative pole, upon the turmeric paper, a\r\nvery few turns of the machine sufficed to show the evolution of acid at the\r\nformer, and alkali at the latter, exactly in the manner effected by a\r\nvolta-electric current.\r\n\r\n455. The pieces of litmus and turmeric paper were _now_ placed each upon a\r\nseparate plate of glass, and connected by an insulated string four feet\r\nlong, moistened in the same solution of sulphate of soda: the terminal\r\ndecomposing wire points were placed upon the papers as before. On working\r\nthe machine, the same evolution of acid and alkali appeared as in the\r\nformer instance, and with equal readiness, notwithstanding that the places\r\nof their appearance were four feet apart from each other. Finally, a piece\r\nof string, seventy feet long, was used. It was insulated in the air by\r\nsuspenders of silk, so that the electricity passed through its entire\r\nlength: decomposition took place exactly as in former cases, alkali and\r\nacid appearing at the two extremities in their proper places.\r\n\r\n456. Experiments were then made both with sulphate of soda and iodide of\r\npotassium, to ascertain if any diminution of decomposing effect was\r\nproduced by such great extension as those just described of the moist\r\nconductor or body under decomposition; but whether the contact of the\r\ndecomposing point connected with the discharging train was made with\r\nturmeric paper touching the prime conductor, or with other turmeric paper\r\nconnected with it through the seventy feet of string, the spot of alkali\r\nfor an equal number of turns of the machine had equal intensity of colour.\r\nThe same results occurred at the other decomposing wire, whether the salt\r\nor the iodide were used; and it was fully proved that this great extension\r\nof the distance between the poles produced no effect whatever on the amount\r\nof decomposition, provided the same _quantity_ of electricity were passed\r\nin both cases (377.).\r\n\r\n457. The negative point of the discharging train, the turmeric paper, and\r\nthe string were then removed; the positive point was left resting upon the\r\nlitmus paper, and the latter touched by a piece of moistened string held in\r\nthe hand. A few turns of the machine evolved acid at the positive point as\r\nfreely as before.\r\n\r\n458. The end of the moistened string, instead of being held in the hand,\r\nwas suspended by glass in the air. On working the machine the electricity\r\nproceeded from the conductor through the wire point to the litmus paper,\r\nand thence away by the intervention of the string to the air, so that there\r\nwas (as in the last experiment) but one metallic pole; still acid was\r\nevolved there as freely as in any former case.\r\n\r\n459. When any of these experiments were repeated with electricity from the\r\nnegative conductor, corresponding effects were produced whether one or two\r\ndecomposing wires were used. The results were always constant, considered\r\nin relation to the _direction_ of the electric current.\r\n\r\n460. These experiments were varied so as to include the action of only one\r\nmetallic pole, but that not the pole connected with the machine. Turmeric\r\npaper was moistened in solution of sulphate of soda, placed upon glass, and\r\nconnected with the discharging train (292.) by a decomposing wire (312.); a\r\npiece of wet string was hung from it, the lower extremity of which was\r\nbrought opposite a point connected with the positive prime conductor of the\r\nmachine. The machine was then worked for a few turns, and alkali\r\nimmediately appeared at the point of the discharging train which rested on\r\nthe turmeric paper. Corresponding effects took place at the negative\r\nconductor of a machine.\r\n\r\n461. These cases are abundantly sufficient to show that electrochemical\r\ndecomposition does not depend upon the simultaneous action of two metallic\r\npoles, since a single pole might be used, decomposition ensue, and one or\r\nother of the elements liberated, pass to the pole, according as it was\r\npositive or negative. In considering the course taken by, and the final\r\narrangement of, the other element, I had little doubt that I should find it\r\nhad receded towards the other extremity, and that the air itself had acted\r\nas a pole, an expectation which was fully confirmed in the following\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n462. A piece of turmeric paper, not more than 0.4 of an inch in length and\r\n0.5 of an inch in width, was moistened with sulphate of soda and placed\r\nupon the edge of a glass plate opposite to, and about two inches from, a\r\npoint connected with the discharging train (Plate IV. fig. 47.); a piece of\r\ntinfoil, resting upon the same glass plate, was connected with the machine,\r\nand also with the turmeric paper, by a decomposing wire _a_ (312.). The\r\nmachine was then worked, the positive electricity passing into the turmeric\r\npaper at the point _p_, and out at the extremity _n_. After forty or fifty\r\nturns of the machine, the extremity _n_ was examined, and the two points or\r\nangles found deeply coloured by the presence of free alkali (fig. 48.).\r\n\r\n463. A similar piece of litmus paper, dipped in solution of sulphate of\r\nsoda _n_, fig. 49, was now supported upon the end of the discharging train\r\n_a_, and its extremity brought opposite to a point _p_, connected with the\r\nconductor of the machine. After working the machine for a short time, acid\r\nwas developed at both the corners towards the point, i.e. at both the\r\ncorners receiving the electricities from the air. Every precaution was\r\ntaken to prevent this acid from being formed by sparks or brushes passing\r\nthrough the air (322.); and these, with the accompanying general facts, are\r\nsufficient to show that the acid was really the result of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition (466.).\r\n\r\n464. Then a long piece of turmeric paper, large at one end and pointed at\r\nthe other, was moistened in the saline solution, and immediately connected\r\nwith the conductor of the machine, so that its pointed extremity was\r\nopposite a point upon the discharging train. When the machine was worked,\r\nalkali was evolved at that point; and even when the discharging train was\r\nremoved, and the electricity left to be diffused and carried off altogether\r\nby the air, still alkali was evolved where the electricity left the\r\nturmeric paper.\r\n\r\n465. Arrangements were then made in which no metallic communication with\r\nthe decomposing matter was allowed, but both poles (if they might now be\r\ncalled by that name) formed of air only. A piece of turmeric paper _a_ fig.\r\n50, and a piece of litmus paper _b_, were dipped in solution of sulphate of\r\nsoda, put together so as to form one moist pointed conductor, and supported\r\non wax between two needle points, one, _p_, connected by a wire with the\r\nconductor of the machine, and the other, _n_, with the discharging train.\r\nThe interval in each case between the points was about half an inch; the\r\npositive point _p_ was opposite the litmus paper; the negative point _n_\r\nopposite the turmeric. The machine was then worked for a time, upon which\r\nevidence of decomposition quickly appeared, for the point of the litmus _b_\r\nbecame reddened from acid evolved there, and the point of the turmeric _a_\r\nred from a similar and simultaneous evolution of alkali.\r\n\r\n466. Upon turning the paper conductor round, so that the litmus point\r\nshould now give off the positive electricity, and the turmeric point\r\nreceive it, and working the machine for a short time, both the red spots\r\ndisappeared, and as on continuing the action of the machine no red spot was\r\nre-formed at the litmus extremity, it proved that in the first instance\r\n(463.) the effect was not due to the action of brushes or mere electric\r\ndischarges causing the formation of nitric acid from the air (322.).\r\n\r\n467. If the combined litmus and turmeric paper in this experiment be\r\nconsidered as constituting a conductor independent of the machine or the\r\ndischarging train, and the final places of the elements evolved be\r\nconsidered in relation to this conductor, then it will be found that the\r\nacid collects at the _negative_ or receiving end or pole of the\r\narrangement, and the alkali at the _positive_ or delivering extremity.\r\n\r\n468. Similar litmus and turmeric paper points were now placed upon glass\r\nplates, and connected by a string six feet long, both string and paper\r\nbeing moistened in solution of sulphate of soda; a needle point connected\r\nwith the machine was brought opposite the litmus paper point, and another\r\nneedle point connected with the discharging train brought opposite the\r\nturmeric paper. On working the machine, acid appeared on the litmus, and\r\nalkali on the turmeric paper; but the latter was not so abundant as in\r\nformer cases, for much of the electricity passed off from the string into\r\nthe air, and diminished the quantity discharged at the turmeric point.\r\n\r\n469. Finally, a series of four small compound conductors, consisting of\r\nlitmus and turmeric paper (fig. 51.) moistened in solution of sulphate of\r\nsoda, were supported on glass rods, in a line at a little distance from\r\neach other, between the points _p_ and _n_ of the machine and discharging\r\ntrain, so that the electricity might pass in succession through them,\r\nentering in at the litmus points _b, b_, and passing out at the turmeric\r\npoints _a, a_. On working the machine carefully, so as to avoid sparks and\r\nbrushes (322.), I soon obtained evidence of decomposition in each of the\r\nmoist conductors, for all the litmus points exhibited free acid, and the\r\nturmeric points equally showed free alkali.\r\n\r\n470. On using solutions of iodide of potassium, acetate of lead, &c.,\r\nsimilar effects were obtained; but as they were all consistent with the\r\nresults above described, I refrain from describing the appearances\r\nminutely.\r\n\r\n471. These cases of electro-chemical decomposition are in their nature\r\nexactly of the same kind as those affected under ordinary circumstances by\r\nthe voltaic battery, notwithstanding the great differences as to the\r\npresence or absence, or at least as to the nature of the parts usually\r\ncalled poles; and also of the final situation of the elements eliminated at\r\nthe electrified boundary surfaces (467.). They indicate at once an internal\r\naction of the parts suffering decomposition, and appear to show that the\r\npower which is effectual in separating the elements is exerted there, and\r\nnot at the poles. But I shall defer the consideration of this point for a\r\nshort time (493. 518.), that I may previously consider another supposed\r\ncondition of electro-chemical decomposition[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] I find (since making and describing these results,) from a note to\r\n  Sir Humphry Davy's paper in the Philosophical Transactions, 1807, p.\r\n  31, that that philosopher, in repeating Wollaston's experiment of the\r\n  decomposition of water by common electricity (327. 330.) used an\r\n  arrangement somewhat like some of those I have described. He immersed\r\n  a guarded platina point connected with the machine in distilled water,\r\n  and dissipated the electricity from the water into the air by\r\n  moistened filaments of cotton. In this way he states that he obtained\r\n  oxygen and hydrogen _separately_ from each other. This experiment, had\r\n  I known of it, ought to have been quoted in an earlier series of these\r\n  Researches (342.); but it does not remove any of the objections I have\r\n  made to the use of Wollaston's apparatus as a test of true chemical\r\n  action (331.).\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ ii. _Influence of Water in Electro-chemical Decomposition._\r\n\r\n472. It is the opinion of several philosophers, that the presence of water\r\nis essential in electro-chemical decomposition, and also for the evolution\r\nof electricity in the voltaic battery itself. As the decomposing cell is\r\nmerely one of the cells of the battery, into which particular substances\r\nare introduced for the purpose of experiment, it is probable that what is\r\nan essential condition in the one case is more or less so in the other. The\r\nopinion, therefore, that water is necessary to decomposition, may have been\r\nfounded on the statement made by Sir Humphry Davy, that \"there are no\r\nfluids known, except such as contain water, which are capable of being made\r\nthe medium of connexion between the metals or metal of the voltaic\r\napparatus[A]:\" and again, \"when any substance rendered fluid by heat,\r\nconsisting of _water_, oxygen, and inflammable or metallic matter, is\r\nexposed to those wires, similar phenomena (of decomposition) occur[B].\"\r\n\r\n  [A] Elements of Chemical Philosophy, p. 160, &c.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. pp. 144, 145.\r\n\r\n473. This opinion has, I think, been shown by other philosophers not to be\r\naccurate, though I do not know where to refer for a contradiction of it.\r\nSir Humphry Davy himself said in 1801[A], that dry nitre, caustic potash\r\nand soda are conductors of galvanism when rendered fluid by a high degree\r\nof heat, but he must have considered them, or the nitre at least, as not\r\nsuffering decomposition, for the statements above were made by him eleven\r\nyears subsequently. In 1826 he also pointed out, that bodies not containing\r\nwater, as _fused litharge_ and _chlorate of potassa_, were sufficient to\r\nform, with platina and zinc, powerful electromotive circles[B]; but he is\r\nhere speaking of the _production_ of electricity in the pile, and not of\r\nits effects when evolved; nor do his words at all imply that any correction\r\nof his former distinct statements relative to _decomposition_ was required.\r\n\r\n  [A] Journal of the Royal Institution, 1802, p. 53.\r\n\r\n  [B] Philosophical Transactions, 1826, p. 406.\r\n\r\n474. I may refer to the last series of these Experimental Researches (380.\r\n402.) as setting the matter at rest, by proving that there are hundreds of\r\nbodies equally influential with water in this respect; that amongst binary\r\ncompounds, oxides, chlorides, iodides, and even sulphurets (402.) were\r\neffective; and that amongst more complicated compounds, cyanides and salts,\r\nof equal efficacy, occurred in great numbers (402.).\r\n\r\n475. Water, therefore, is in this respect merely one of a very numerous\r\nclass of substances, instead of being the _only one_ and _essential_; and\r\nit is of that class one of the _worst_ as to its capability of facilitating\r\nconduction and suffering decomposition. The reasons why it obtained for a\r\ntime an exclusive character which it so little deserved are evident, and\r\nconsist, in the general necessity of a fluid condition (394.); in its being\r\nthe _only one_ of this class of bodies existing in the fluid state at\r\ncommon temperatures; its abundant supply as the great natural solvent; and\r\nits constant use in that character in philosophical investigations, because\r\nof its having a smaller interfering, injurious, or complicating action upon\r\nthe bodies, either dissolved or evolved, than any other substance.\r\n\r\n476. The analogy of the decomposing or experimental cell to the other cells\r\nof the voltaic battery renders it nearly certain that any of those\r\nsubstances which are decomposable when fluid, as described in my last paper\r\n(402.), would, if they could be introduced between the metallic plates of\r\nthe pile, be equally effectual with water, if not more so. Sir Humphry Davy\r\nfound that litharge and chlorate of potassa were thus effectual[A]. I have\r\nconstructed various voltaic arrangements, and found the above conclusion to\r\nhold good. When any of the following substances in a fused state were\r\ninterposed between copper and platina, voltaic action more or less powerful\r\nwas produced. Nitre; chlorate of potassa; carbonate of potassa; sulphate of\r\nsoda; chloride of lead, of sodium, of bismuth, of calcium; iodide of lead;\r\noxide of bismuth; oxide of lead: the electric current was in the same\r\ndirection as if acids had acted upon the metals. When any of the same\r\nsubstances, or phosphate of soda, were made to act on platina and iron,\r\nstill more powerful voltaic combinations of the same kind were produced.\r\nWhen either nitrate of silver or chloride of silver was the fluid substance\r\ninterposed, there was voltaic action, but the electric current was in the\r\nreverse direction.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1826, p. 406.\r\n\r\niii. _Theory of Electro-chemical Decomposition._\r\n\r\n477. The extreme beauty and value of electro-chemical decompositions have\r\ngiven to that power which the voltaic pile possesses of causing their\r\noccurrence an interest surpassing that of any other of its properties; for\r\nthe power is not only intimately connected with the continuance, if not\r\nwith the production, of the electrical phenomena, but it has furnished us\r\nwith the most beautiful demonstrations of the nature of many compound\r\nbodies; has in the hands of Becquerel been employed in compounding\r\nsubstances; has given us several new combinations, and sustains us with the\r\nhope that when thoroughly understood it will produce many more.\r\n\r\n478. What may be considered as the general facts of electrochemical\r\ndecomposition are agreed to by nearly all who have written on the subject.\r\nThey consist in the separation of the decomposable substance acted upon\r\ninto its proximate or sometimes ultimate principles, whenever both poles of\r\nthe pile are in contact with that substance in a proper condition; in the\r\nevolution of these principles at distant points, i.e. at the poles of the\r\npile, where they are either finally set free or enter into union with the\r\nsubstance of the poles; and in the constant determination of the evolved\r\nelements or principles to particular poles according to certain\r\nwell-ascertained laws.\r\n\r\n479. But the views of men of science vary much as to the nature of the\r\naction by which these effects are produced; and as it is certain that we\r\nshall be better able to apply the power when we really understand the\r\nmanner in which it operates, this difference of opinion is a strong\r\ninducement to further inquiry. I have been led to hope that the following\r\ninvestigations might be considered, not as an increase of that which is\r\ndoubtful, but a real addition to this branch of knowledge.\r\n\r\n480. It will be needful that I briefly state the views of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition already put forth, that their present contradictory and\r\nunsatisfactory state may be seen before I give that which seems to me more\r\naccurately to agree with facts; and I have ventured to discuss them freely,\r\ntrusting that I should give no offence to their high-minded authors; for I\r\nfelt convinced that if I were right, they would be pleased that their views\r\nshould serve as stepping-stones for the advance of science; and that if I\r\nwere wrong, they would excuse the zeal which misled me, since it was\r\nexerted for the service of that great cause whose prosperity and progress\r\nthey have desired.\r\n\r\n481. Grotthuss, in the year 1805, wrote expressly on the decomposition of\r\nliquids by voltaic electricity[A]. He considers the pile as an electric\r\nmagnet, i.e. as an attractive and repulsive agent; the poles having\r\n_attractive_ and _repelling_ powers. The pole from whence resinous\r\nelectricity issues attracts hydrogen and repels oxygen, whilst that from\r\nwhich vitreous electricity proceeds attracts oxygen and repels hydrogen; so\r\nthat each of the elements of a particle of water, for instance, is subject\r\nto an attractive and a repulsive force, acting in contrary directions, the\r\ncentres of action of which are reciprocally opposed. The action of each\r\nforce in relation to a molecule of water situated in the course of the\r\nelectric current is in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance at\r\nwhich it is exerted, thus giving (it is stated) for such a molecule a\r\n_constant force_[B]. He explains the appearance of the elements at a\r\ndistance from each other by referring to a succession of decompositions and\r\nrecompositions occurring amongst the intervening particles[C], and he\r\nthinks it probable that those which are about to separate at the poles\r\nunite to the two electricities there, and in consequence become gases[D].\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, 1806, tom, lviii. p. 64.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. pp. 66, 67, also tom. lxiii. p. 20.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. tom. lviii. p. 68, tom, lxiii. p. 20.\r\n\r\n  [D] Ibid. tom. lxiii. p. 34.\r\n\r\n482. Sir Humphry Davy's celebrated Bakerian Lecture on some chemical\r\nagencies of electricity was read in November 1806, and is almost entirely\r\noccupied in the consideration of _electro-chemical decompositions_. The\r\nfacts are of the utmost value, and, with the general points established,\r\nare universally known. The _mode of action_ by which the effects take place\r\nis stated very generally, so generally, indeed, that probably a dozen\r\nprecise schemes of electro-chemical action might be drawn up, differing\r\nessentially from each other, yet all agreeing with the statement there\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n483. When Sir Humphry Davy uses more particular expressions, he seems to\r\nrefer the decomposing effects to the attractions of the poles. This is the\r\ncase in the \"general expression of facts\" given at pp. 28 and 29 of the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1807, also at p. 30. Again at p. 160 of the\r\nElements of Chemical Philosophy, he speaks of the great attracting powers\r\nof the surfaces of the poles. He mentions the probability of a succession\r\nof decompositions and recompositions throughout the fluid,--agreeing in\r\nthat respect with Grotthuss[A]; and supposes that the attractive and\r\nrepellent agencies may be communicated from the metallic surfaces\r\nthroughout the whole of the menstruum[B], being communicated from _one\r\nparticle to another particle of the same kind_[C], and diminishing in\r\nstrength from the place of the poles to the middle point, which is\r\nnecessarily neutral[D]. In reference to this diminution of power at\r\nincreased distances from the poles, he states that in a circuit of ten\r\ninches of water, solution of sulphate of potassa placed four inches from\r\nthe positive pole, did not decompose; whereas when only two inches from\r\nthat pole, it did render up its elements[E].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1807, pp. 29, 30.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. p. 39.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. p. 29.\r\n\r\n  [D] Ibid. p. 42.\r\n\r\n  [E] Ibid. p. 42.\r\n\r\n484. When in 1826 Sir Humphry Davy wrote again on this subject, he stated\r\nthat he found nothing to alter in the fundamental theory laid down in the\r\noriginal communication[A], and uses the terms attraction and repulsion\r\napparently in the same sense as before[B].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1826, p. 383.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. pp. 389, 407, 115.\r\n\r\n485. Messrs. Riffault and Chompré experimented on this subject in 1807.\r\nThey came to the conclusion that the voltaic current caused decompositions\r\nthroughout its whole course in the humid conductor, not merely as\r\npreliminary to the recompositions spoken of by Grotthuss and Davy, but\r\nproducing final separation of the elements in the _course_ of the current,\r\nand elsewhere than at the poles. They considered the _negative_ current as\r\ncollecting and carrying the acids, &c. to the _positive_ pole, and the\r\n_positive_ current as doing the same duty with the bases, and collecting\r\nthem at the _negative_ pole. They likewise consider the currents as _more\r\npowerful_ the nearer they are to their respective poles, and state that the\r\npositive current is _superior_ in power to the negative current[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, 1807, tom. lxiii. p. 83, &c.\r\n\r\n486. M. Biot is very cautious in expressing an opinion as to the cause of\r\nthe separation of the elements of a compound body[A]. But as far as the\r\neffects can be understood, he refers them to the opposite electrical states\r\nof the portions of the decomposing substance in the neighbourhood of the\r\ntwo poles. The fluid is most positive at the positive pole; that state\r\ngradually diminishes to the middle distance, where the fluid is neutral or\r\nnot electrical; but from thence to the negative pole it becomes more and\r\nmore negative[B]. When a particle of salt is decomposed at the negative\r\npole, the acid particle is considered as acquiring a negative electrical\r\nstate from the pole, stronger than that of the surrounding _undecomposed_\r\nparticles, and is therefore repelled from amongst them, and from out of\r\nthat portion of the liquid towards the positive pole, towards which also it\r\nis drawn by the attraction of the pole itself and the particles of positive\r\n_undecomposed_ fluid around it[C].\r\n\r\n  [A] Précis Elémentaire de Physique, 3me édition, 1824, tom. i. p. 641.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. p. 637.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. pp. 641, 642.\r\n\r\n487. M. Biot does not appear to admit the successive decompositions and\r\nrecompositions spoken of by Grotthuss, Davy, &c. &c.; but seems to consider\r\nthe substance whilst in transit as combined with, or rather attached to,\r\nthe electricity for the time[A], and though it communicates this\r\nelectricity to the surrounding undecomposed matter with which it is in\r\ncontact, yet it retains during the transit a little superiority with\r\nrespect to that kind which it first received from the pole, and is, by\r\nvirtue of that difference, carried forward through the fluid to the\r\nopposite pole[B].\r\n\r\n  [A] Précis Elémentaire de Physique, 3me édition, 1824, tom. i. p. 636.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. p, 642.\r\n\r\n488. This theory implies that decomposition takes place at both poles upon\r\ndistinct portions of fluid, and not at all in the intervening parts. The\r\nlatter serve merely as imperfect conductors, which, assuming an electric\r\nstate, urge particles electrified more highly at the poles through them in\r\nopposite directions, by virtue of a series of ordinary electrical\r\nattractions and repulsions[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Précis Elémentaire de Physique, 3me édition, 1824, tom. i. pp.\r\n  638, 642.\r\n\r\n489. M.A. de la Rive investigated this subject particularly, and published\r\na paper on it in 1825[A]. He thinks those who have referred the phenomena\r\nto the attractive powers of the poles, rather express the general fact than\r\ngive any explication of it. He considers the results as due to an actual\r\ncombination of the elements, or rather of half of them, with the\r\nelectricities passing from the poles in consequence of a kind of play of\r\naffinities between the matter and electricity[B]. The current from the\r\npositive pole combining with the hydrogen, or the bases it finds there,\r\nleaves the oxygen and acids at liberty, but carries the substances it is\r\nunited with across to the negative pole, where, because of the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the metal as a conductor[C], it is separated from them,\r\nentering the metal and leaving the hydrogen or bases upon its surface. In\r\nthe same manner the electricity from the negative pole sets the hydrogen\r\nand bases which it finds there, free, but combines with the oxygen and\r\nacids, carries them across to the positive pole, and there deposits\r\nthem[D]. In this respect M. de la Rive's hypothesis accords in part with\r\nthat of MM. Riffault and Chompré (485.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, tom, xxviii. p. 190.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. pp. 200, 202.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. p. 202.\r\n\r\n  [D] Ibid. p. 201.\r\n\r\n490. M. de la Rive considers the portions of matter which are decomposed to\r\nbe those contiguous to _both_ poles[A]. He does not admit with others the\r\nsuccessive decompositions and recompositions in the whole course of the\r\nelectricity through the humid conductor[B], but thinks the middle parts are\r\nin themselves unaltered, or at least serve only to conduct the two contrary\r\ncurrents of electricity and matter which set off from the opposite\r\npoles[C]. The decomposition, therefore, of a particle of water, or a\r\nparticle of salt, may take place at either pole, and when once effected, it\r\nis final for the time, no recombination taking place, except the momentary\r\nunion of the transferred particle with the electricity be so considered.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, tom, xxviii. pp. 197, 198.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. pp. 192, 199.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. p. 200.\r\n\r\n491. The latest communication that I am aware of on the subject is by M.\r\nHachette: its date is October 1832[A]. It is incidental to the description\r\nof the decomposition of water by the magneto-electric currents (346.). One\r\nof the results of the experiment is, that \"it is not necessary, as has been\r\nsupposed, that for the chemical decomposition of water, the action of the\r\ntwo electricities, positive and negative, should be simultaneous.\"\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, tom, xxviii. tom. li. p. 73.\r\n\r\n492. It is more than probable that many other views of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition may have been published, and perhaps amongst them some which,\r\ndiffering from those above, might, even in my own opinion, were I\r\nacquainted with them, obviate the necessity for the publication of my\r\nviews. If such be the case, I have to regret my ignorance of them, and\r\napologize to the authors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n493. That electro-chemical decomposition does not depend upon any direct\r\nattraction and repulsion of the poles (meaning thereby the metallic\r\nterminations either of the voltaic battery, or ordinary electrical machine\r\narrangements (312.),) upon the elements in contact with or near to them,\r\nappeared very evident from the experiments made in air (462, 465, &c.),\r\nwhen the substances evolved did not collect about any poles, but, in\r\nobedience to the direction of the current, were evolved, and I would say\r\nejected, at the extremities of the decomposing substance. But\r\nnotwithstanding the extreme dissimilarity in the character of air and\r\nmetals, and the almost total difference existing between them as to their\r\nmode of conducting electricity, and becoming charged with it, it might\r\nperhaps still be contended, although quite hypothetically, that the\r\nbounding portions of air were now the surfaces or places of attraction, as\r\nthe metals had been supposed to be before. In illustration of this and\r\nother points, I endeavoured to devise an arrangement by which I could\r\ndecompose a body against a surface of water, as well as against air or\r\nmetal, and succeeded in doing so unexceptionably in the following manner.\r\nAs the experiment for very natural reasons requires many precautions, to be\r\nsuccessful, and will be referred to hereafter in illustration of the views\r\nI shall venture to give, I must describe it minutely.\r\n\r\n494. A glass basin (fig. 52.), four inches in diameter and four inches\r\ndeep, had a division of mica _a_, fixed across the upper part so as to\r\ndescend one inch and a half below the edge, and be perfectly water-tight at\r\nthe sides: a plate of platina _b_, three inches wide, was put into the\r\nbasin on one side of the division _a_, and retained there by a glass block\r\nbelow, so that any gas produced by it in a future stage of the experiment\r\nshould not ascend beyond the mica, and cause currents in the liquid on that\r\nside. A strong solution of sulphate of magnesia was carefully poured\r\nwithout splashing into the basin, until it rose a little above the lower\r\nedge of the mica division _a_, great care being taken that the glass or\r\nmica on the unoccupied or _c_ side of the division in the figure, should\r\nnot be moistened by agitation of the solution above the level to which it\r\nrose. A thin piece of clean cork, well-wetted in distilled water, was then\r\ncarefully and lightly placed on the solution at the _c_ side, and distilled\r\nwater poured gently on to it until a stratum the eighth of an inch in\r\nthickness appeared over the sulphate of magnesia; all was then left for a\r\nfew minutes, that any solution adhering to the cork might sink away from\r\nit, or be removed by the water on which it now floated; and then more\r\ndistilled water was added in a similar manner, until it reached nearly to\r\nthe top of the glass. In this way solution of the sulphate occupied the\r\nlower part of the glass, and also the upper on the right-hand side of the\r\nmica; but on the left-hand side of the division a stratum of water from _c_\r\nto _d_, one inch and a half in depth, reposed upon it, the two presenting,\r\nwhen looked through horizontally, a comparatively definite plane of\r\ncontact. A second platina pole _e_, was arranged so as to be just under the\r\nsurface of the water, in a position nearly horizontal, a little inclination\r\nbeing given to it, that gas evolved during decomposition might escape: the\r\npart immersed was three inches and a half long by one inch wide, and about\r\nseven-eighths of an inch of water intervened between it and the solution of\r\nsulphate of magnesia.\r\n\r\n495. The latter pole _e_ was now connected with the negative end of a\r\nvoltaic battery, of forty pairs of plates four inches square, whilst the\r\nformer pole _b_ was connected with the positive end. There was action and\r\ngas evolved at both poles; but from the intervention of the pure water, the\r\ndecomposition was very feeble compared to what the battery would have\r\neffected in a uniform solution. After a little while (less than a minute,)\r\nmagnesia also appeared at the negative side: _it did not make its\r\nappearance at the negative metallic pole, but in the water_, at the plane\r\nwhere the solution and the water met; and on looking at it horizontally, it\r\ncould be there perceived lying in the water upon the solution, not rising\r\nmore than the fourth of an inch above the latter, whilst the water between\r\nit and the negative pole was perfectly clear. On continuing the action, the\r\nbubbles of hydrogen rising upwards from the negative pole impressed a\r\ncirculatory movement on the stratum of water, upwards in the middle, and\r\ndownwards at the side, which gradually gave an ascending form to the cloud\r\nof magnesia in the part just under the pole, having an appearance as if it\r\nwere there attracted to it; but this was altogether an effect of the\r\ncurrents, and did not occur until long after the phenomena looked for were\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained.\r\n\r\n496. After a little while the voltaic communication was broken, and the\r\nplatina poles removed with as little agitation as possible from the water\r\nand solution, for the purpose of examining the liquid adhering to them. The\r\npole _c_, when touched by turmeric paper, gave no traces of alkali, nor\r\ncould anything but pure water be found upon it. The pole _b_, though drawn\r\nthrough a much greater depth and quantity of fluid, was found so acid as to\r\ngive abundant evidence to litmus paper, the tongue, and other tests. Hence\r\nthere had been no interference of alkaline salts in any way, undergoing\r\nfirst decomposition, and then causing the separation of the magnesia at a\r\ndistance from the pole by mere chemical agencies. This experiment was\r\nrepeated again and again, and always successfully.\r\n\r\n497. As, therefore, the substances evolved in cases of electrochemical\r\ndecomposition may be made to appear against air (465. 469.),--which,\r\naccording to common language, is not a conductor, nor is decomposed, or\r\nagainst water (495.), which is a conductor, and can be decomposed,--as well\r\nas against the metal poles, which are excellent conductors, but\r\nundecomposable, there appears but little reason to consider the phenomena\r\ngenerally, as due to the _attraction_ or attractive powers of the latter,\r\nwhen used in the ordinary way, since similar attractions can hardly be\r\nimagined in the former instances.\r\n\r\n498. It may be said that the surfaces of air or of water in these cases\r\nbecome the poles, and exert attractive powers; but what proof is there of\r\nthat, except the fact that the matters evolved collect there, which is the\r\npoint to be explained, and cannot be justly quoted as its own explanation?\r\nOr it may be said, that any section of the humid conductor, as that in the\r\npresent case, where the solution and the water meet, may be considered as\r\nrepresenting the pole. But such does not appear to me to be the view of\r\nthose who have written on the subject, certainly not of some of them, and\r\nis inconsistent with the supposed laws which they have assumed, as\r\ngoverning the diminution of power at increased distances from the poles.\r\n\r\n499. Grotthuss, for instance, describes the poles as centres of attractive\r\nand repulsive forces (481.), these forces varying inversely as the squares\r\nof the distances, and says, therefore, that a particle placed anywhere\r\nbetween the poles will be acted upon by a constant force. But the compound\r\nforce, resulting from such a combination as he supposes, would be anything\r\nbut a constant force; it would evidently be a force greatest at the poles,\r\nand diminishing to the middle distance. Grotthuss is right, however, _in\r\nthe fact_, according to my experiments (502. 505.), that the particles are\r\nacted upon by equal force everywhere in the circuit, when the conditions of\r\nthe experiment are the simplest possible; but the fact is against his\r\ntheory, and is also, I think, against all theories that place the\r\ndecomposing effect in the attractive power of the poles.\r\n\r\n500. Sir Humphry Davy, who also speaks of the _diminution_ of power with\r\nincrease of distance from the poles[A] (483.), supposes, that when both\r\npoles are acting on substances to decompose them, still the power of\r\ndecomposition _diminishes_ to the middle distance. In this statement of\r\nfact he is opposed to Grotthuss, and quotes an experiment in which sulphate\r\nof potassa, placed at different distances from the poles in a humid\r\nconductor of constant length, decomposed when near the pole, but not when\r\nat a distance. Such a consequence would necessarily result theoretically\r\nfrom considering the poles as centres of attraction and repulsion; but I\r\nhave not found the statement borne out by other experiments (505.); and in\r\nthe one quoted by him the effect was doubtless due to some of the many\r\ninterfering causes of variation which attend such investigations.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1807, p. 42.\r\n\r\n501. A glass vessel had a platina plate fixed perpendicularly across it, so\r\nas to divide it into two cells: a head of mica was fixed over it, so as to\r\ncollect the gas it might evolve during experiments; then each cell, and the\r\nspace beneath the mica, was filled with dilute sulphuric acid. Two poles\r\nwere provided, consisting each of a platina wire terminated by a plate of\r\nthe same metal; each was fixed into a tube passing through its upper end by\r\nan air-tight joint, that it might be moveable, and yet that the gas evolved\r\nat it might be collected. The tubes were filled with the acid, and one\r\nimmersed in each cell. Each platina pole was equal in surface to one side\r\nof the dividing plate in the middle glass vessel, and the whole might be\r\nconsidered as an arrangement between the poles of the battery of a humid\r\ndecomposable conductor divided in the middle by the interposed platina\r\ndiaphragm. It was easy, when required, to draw one of the poles further up\r\nthe tube, and then the platina diaphragm was no longer in the middle of the\r\nhumid conductor. But whether it were thus arranged at the middle, or\r\ntowards one side, it always evolved a quantity of oxygen and hydrogen equal\r\nto that evolved by both the extreme plates[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] There are certain precautions, in this and such experiments, which\r\n  can only be understood and guarded against by a knowledge of the\r\n  phenomena to be described in the first part of the Sixth Series of\r\n  these Researches.\r\n\r\n502. If the wires of a galvanometer be terminated by plates, and these be\r\nimmersed in dilute acid, contained in a regularly formed rectangular glass\r\ntrough, connected at each end with a voltaic battery by poles equal to the\r\nsection of the fluid, a part of the electricity will pass through the\r\ninstrument and cause a certain deflection. And if the plates are always\r\nretained at the _same distance from each other_ and from the sides of the\r\ntrough, are always parallel to each other, and uniformly placed relative to\r\nthe fluid, then, whether they are immersed near the middle of the\r\ndecomposing solution, or at one end, still the instrument will indicate the\r\nsame deflection, and consequently the same electric influence.\r\n\r\n503. It is very evident, that when the width of the decomposing conductor\r\nvaries, as is always the case when mere wires or plates, as poles, are\r\ndipped into or are surrounded by solution, no constant expression can be\r\ngiven as to the action upon a single particle placed in the course of the\r\ncurrent, nor any conclusion of use, relative to the supposed attractive or\r\nrepulsive force of the poles, be drawn. The force will vary as the distance\r\nfrom the pole varies; as the particle is directly between the poles, or\r\nmore or less on one side; and even as it is nearer to or further from the\r\nsides of the containing vessels, or as the shape of the vessel itself\r\nvaries; and, in fact, by making variations in the form of the arrangement,\r\nthe force upon any single particle may be made to increase, or diminish, or\r\nremain constant, whilst the distance between the particle and the pole\r\nshall remain the same; or the force may be made to increase, or diminish,\r\nor remain constant, either as the distance increases or as it diminishes.\r\n\r\n504. From numerous experiments, I am led to believe the following general\r\nexpression to be correct; but I purpose examining it much further, and\r\nwould therefore wish not to be considered at present as pledged to its\r\naccuracy. The _sum of chemical decomposition is constant_ for any section\r\ntaken across a decomposing conductor, uniform in its nature, at whatever\r\ndistance the poles may be from each other or from the section; or however\r\nthat section may intersect the currents, whether directly across them, or\r\nso oblique as to reach almost from pole to pole, or whether it be plane, or\r\ncurved, or irregular in the utmost degree; provided the current of\r\nelectricity be retained constant in quantity (377.), and that the section\r\npasses through every part of the current through the decomposing conductor.\r\n\r\n505. I have reason to believe that the statement might be made still more\r\ngeneral, and expressed thus: That _for a constant quantity of electricity,\r\nwhatever the decomposing conductor may be, whether water, saline solutions,\r\nacids, fused bodies, &c., the amount of electro-chemical action is also a\r\nconstant quantity, i.e. would always be equivalent to a standard chemical\r\neffect founded upon ordinary chemical affinity_. I have this investigation\r\nin hand, with several others, and shall be prepared to give it in the next\r\nseries but one of these Researches.\r\n\r\n506. Many other arguments might be adduced against the hypotheses of the\r\nattraction of the poles being the cause of electro-chemical decomposition;\r\nbut I would rather pass on to the view I have thought more consistent with\r\nfacts, with this single remark; that if decomposition by the voltaic\r\nbattery depended upon the attraction of the poles, or the parts about them,\r\nbeing stronger than the mutual attraction of the particles separated, it\r\nwould follow that the weakest _electrical_ attraction was stronger than, if\r\nnot the strongest, yet very strong _chemical_ attraction, namely, such as\r\nexists between oxygen and hydrogen, potassium and oxygen, chlorine and\r\nsodium, acid and alkali, &c., a consequence which, although perhaps not\r\nimpossible, seems in the present state of the subject very unlikely.\r\n\r\n507. The view which M. de la Rive has taken (489.), and also MM. Riffault\r\nand Chompré (485.), of the manner in which electro-chemical decomposition\r\nis effected, is very different to that already considered, and is not\r\naffected by either the arguments or facts urged against the latter.\r\nConsidering it as stated by the former philosopher, it appears to me to be\r\nincompetent to account for the experiments of decomposition against\r\nsurfaces of air (462. 469.) and water (495.), which I have described; for\r\nif the physical differences between metals and humid conductors, which M.\r\nde la Rive supposes to account for the transmission of the compound of\r\nmatter and electricity in the latter, and the transmission of the\r\nelectricity only with the rejection of the matter in the former, be allowed\r\nfor a moment, still the analogy of air to metal is, electrically\r\nconsidered, so small, that instead of the former replacing the latter\r\n(462.), an effect the very reverse might have been expected. Or if even\r\nthat were allowed, the experiment with water (495.), at once sets the\r\nmatter at rest, the decomposing pole being now of a substance which is\r\nadmitted as competent to transmit the assumed compound of electricity and\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n508. With regard to the views of MM. Riffault and Chompré (485.), the\r\noccurrence of decomposition alone in the _course_ of the current is so\r\ncontrary to the well-known effects obtained in the forms of experiment\r\nadopted up to this time, that it must be proved before the hypothesis\r\ndepending on it need be considered.\r\n\r\n509. The consideration of the various theories of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition, whilst it has made me diffident, has also given me\r\nconfidence to add another to the number; for it is because the one I have\r\nto propose appears, after the most attentive consideration, to explain and\r\nagree with the immense collection of facts belonging to this branch of\r\nscience, and to remain uncontradicted by, or unopposed to, any of them,\r\nthat I have been encouraged to give it.\r\n\r\n510. Electro-chemical decomposition is well known to depend essentially\r\nupon the _current_ of electricity. I have shown that in certain cases\r\n(375.) the decomposition is proportionate to the quantity of electricity\r\npassing, whatever may be its intensity or its source, and that the same is\r\nprobably true for all cases (377.), even when the utmost generality is\r\ntaken on the one hand, and great precision of expression on the other\r\n(505.).\r\n\r\n511. In speaking of the current, I find myself obliged to be still more\r\nparticular than on a former occasion (283.), in consequence of the variety\r\nof views taken by philosophers, all agreeing in the effect of the current\r\nitself. Some philosophers, with Franklin, assume but one electric fluid;\r\nand such must agree together in the general uniformity and character of the\r\nelectric current. Others assume two electric fluids; and here singular\r\ndifferences have arisen.\r\n\r\n512. MM. Riffault and Chompré, for instance, consider the positive and\r\nnegative currents each as causing decomposition, and state that the\r\npositive current is _more powerful_ than the negative current[A], the\r\nnitrate of soda being, under similar circumstances, decomposed by the\r\nformer, but not by the latter.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, 1807, tom, lxiii. p. 84.\r\n\r\n513. M. Hachette states[A] that \"it is not necessary, as has been believed,\r\nthat the action of the two electricities, positive and negative, should be\r\nsimultaneous for the decomposition of water.\" The passage implying, if I\r\nhave caught the meaning aright, that one electricity can be obtained, and\r\ncan be applied in effecting decompositions, independent of the other.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, 1832, tom. li. p. 73.\r\n\r\n514. The view of M. de la Rive to a certain extent agrees with that of M.\r\nHachette, for he considers that the two electricities decompose separate\r\nportions of water (490.)[A]. In one passage he speaks of the two\r\nelectricities as two influences, wishing perhaps to avoid offering a\r\ndecided opinion upon the independent existence of electric fluids; but as\r\nthese influences are considered as combining with the elements set free as\r\nby a species of chemical affinity, and for the time entirely masking their\r\ncharacter, great vagueness of idea is thus introduced, inasmuch as such a\r\nspecies of combination can only be conceived to take place between things\r\nhaving independent existences. The two elementary electric currents, moving\r\nin opposite directions, from pole to pole, constitute the ordinary _voltaic\r\ncurrent._\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, 1825, tom, xxviii. pp. 197, 201.\r\n\r\n515. M. Grotthuss is inclined to believe that the elements of water, when\r\nabout to separate at the poles, combine with the electricities, and so\r\nbecome gases. M. de la Rive's view is the exact reverse of this: whilst\r\npassing through the fluid, they are, according to him, compounds with the\r\nelectricities; when evolved at the poles, they are de-electrified.\r\n\r\n516. I have sought amongst the various experiments quoted in support of\r\nthese views, or connected with electro-chemical decompositions or electric\r\ncurrents, for any which might be considered as sustaining the theory of two\r\nelectricities rather than that of one, but have not been able to perceive a\r\nsingle fact which could be brought forward for such a purpose: or,\r\nadmitting the hypothesis of two electricities, much less have I been able\r\nto perceive the slightest grounds for believing that one electricity in a\r\ncurrent can be more powerful than the other, or that it can be present\r\nwithout the other, or that one can be varied or in the slightest degree\r\naffected, without a corresponding variation in the other[A]. If, upon the\r\nsupposition of two electricities, a current of one can be obtained without\r\nthe other, or the current of one be exalted or diminished more than the\r\nother, we might surely expect some variation either of the chemical or\r\nmagnetical effects, or of both; but no such variations have been observed.\r\nIf a current be so directed that it may act chemically in one part of its\r\ncourse, and magnetically in another, the two actions are always found to\r\ntake place together. A current has not, to my knowledge, been produced\r\nwhich could act chemically and not magnetically, nor any which can act on\r\nthe magnet, and not _at the same time_ chemically[B].\r\n\r\n  [A] See now in relation to this subject, 1627-1645.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n  [B] Thermo-electric currents are of course no exception, because when\r\n  they fail to act chemically they also fail to be currents.\r\n\r\n517. _Judging from facts only_, there is not as yet the slightest reason\r\nfor considering the influence which is present in what we call the electric\r\ncurrent,--whether in metals or fused bodies or humid conductors, or even in\r\nair, flame, and rarefied elastic media,--as a compound or complicated\r\ninfluence. It has never been resolved into simpler or elementary\r\ninfluences, and may perhaps best be conceived of as _an axis of power\r\nhaving contrary forces, exactly equal in amount, in contrary directions_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n518. Passing to the consideration of electro-chemical decomposition, it\r\nappears to me that the effect is produced by an _internal corpuscular\r\naction_, exerted according to the direction of the electric current, and\r\nthat it is due to a force either _super to_, or _giving direction to the\r\nordinary chemical affinity_ of the bodies present. The body under\r\ndecomposition may be considered as a mass of acting particles, all those\r\nwhich are included in the course of the electric current contributing to\r\nthe final effect; and it is because the ordinary chemical affinity is\r\nrelieved, weakened, or partly neutralized by the influence of the electric\r\ncurrent in one direction parallel to the course of the latter, and\r\nstrengthened or added to in the opposite direction, that the combining\r\nparticles have a tendency to pass in opposite courses.\r\n\r\n519. In this view the effect is considered as _essentially dependent_ upon\r\nthe _mutual chemical affinity_ of the particles of opposite kinds.\r\nParticles _aa_, fig. 53, could not be transferred or travel from one pole N\r\ntowards the other P, unless they found particles of the opposite kind _bb_,\r\nready to pass in the contrary direction: for it is by virtue of their\r\nincreased affinity for those particles, combined with their diminished\r\naffinity for such as are behind them in their course, that they are urged\r\nforward: and when any one particle _a_, fig. 54, arrives at the pole, it is\r\nexcluded or set free, because the particle _b_ of the opposite kind, with\r\nwhich it was the moment before in combination, has, under the superinducing\r\ninfluence of the current, a greater attraction for the particle _a'_, which\r\nis before it in its course, than for the particle _a_, towards which its\r\naffinity has been weakened.\r\n\r\n520. As far as regards any single compound particle, the case may be\r\nconsidered as analogous to one of ordinary decomposition, for in fig. 54,\r\n_a_ may be conceived to be expelled from the compound _ab_ by the superior\r\nattraction of _a'_ for _b_, that superior attraction belonging to it in\r\nconsequence of the relative position of _a'b_ and _a_ to the direction of\r\nthe axis of electric power (517.) superinduced by the current. But as all\r\nthe compound particles in the course of the current, except those actually\r\nin contact with the poles, act conjointly, and consist of elementary\r\nparticles, which, whilst they are in one direction expelling, are in the\r\nother being expelled, the case becomes more complicated, but not more\r\ndifficult of comprehension.\r\n\r\n521. It is not here assumed that the acting particles must be in a right\r\nline between the poles. The lines of action which may be supposed to\r\nrepresent the electric currents passing through a decomposing liquid, have\r\nin many experiments very irregular forms; and even in the simplest case of\r\ntwo wires or points immersed as poles in a drop or larger single portion of\r\nfluid, these lines must diverge rapidly from the poles; and the direction\r\nin which the chemical affinity between particles is most powerfully\r\nmodified (519. 520.) will vary with the direction of these lines, according\r\nconstantly with them. But even in reference to these lines or currents, it\r\nis not supposed that the particles which mutually affect each other must of\r\nnecessity be parallel to them, but only that they shall accord generally\r\nwith their direction. Two particles, placed in a line perpendicular to the\r\nelectric current passing in any particular place, are not supposed to have\r\ntheir ordinary chemical relations towards each other affected; but as the\r\nline joining them is inclined one way to the current their mutual affinity\r\nis increased; as it is inclined in the other direction it is diminished;\r\nand the effect is a maximum, when that line is parallel to the current[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In reference to this subject see now electrolytic induction and\r\n  discharge, Series XII. ¶ viii. 1343-1351, &c.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n522. That the actions, of whatever kind they may be, take place frequently\r\nin oblique directions is evident from the circumstance of those particles\r\nbeing included which in numerous cases are not in a line between the poles.\r\nThus, when wires are used as poles in a glass of solution, the\r\ndecompositions and recompositions occur to the right or left of the direct\r\nline between the poles, and indeed in every part to which the currents\r\nextend, as is proved by many experiments, and must therefore often occur\r\nbetween particles obliquely placed as respects the current itself; and when\r\na metallic vessel containing the solution is made one pole, whilst a mere\r\npoint or wire is used for the other, the decompositions and recompositions\r\nmust frequently be still more oblique to the course of the currents.\r\n\r\n523. The theory which I have ventured to put forth (almost) requires an\r\nadmission, that in a compound body capable of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition the elementary particles have a mutual relation to, and\r\ninfluence upon each other, extending beyond those with which they are\r\nimmediately combined. Thus in water, a particle of hydrogen in combination\r\nwith oxygen is considered as not altogether indifferent to other particles\r\nof oxygen, although they are combined with other particles of hydrogen; but\r\nto have an affinity or attraction towards them, which, though it does not\r\nat all approach in force, under ordinary circumstances, to that by which it\r\nis combined with its own particle, can, under the electric influence,\r\nexerted in a definite direction, be made even to surpass it. This general\r\nrelation of particles already in combination to other particles with which\r\nthey are not combined, is sufficiently distinct in numerous results of a\r\npurely chemical character; especially in those where partial decompositions\r\nonly take place, and in Berthollet's experiments on the effects of quantity\r\nupon affinity: and it probably has a direct relation to, and connexion\r\nwith, attraction of aggregation, both in solids and fluids. It is a\r\nremarkable circumstance, that in gases and vapours, where the attraction of\r\naggregation ceases, there likewise the decomposing powers of electricity\r\napparently cease, and there also the chemical action of quantity is no\r\nlonger evident. It seems not unlikely, that the inability to suffer\r\ndecomposition in these cases may be dependent upon the absence of that\r\nmutual attractive relation of the particles which is the cause of\r\naggregation.\r\n\r\n524. I hope I have now distinctly stated, although in general terms, the\r\nview I entertain of the cause of electro-chemical decomposition, _as far as\r\nthat cause can at present be traced and understood_. I conceive the effects\r\nto arise from forces which are _internal_, relative to the matter under\r\ndecomposition--and _not external_, as they might be considered, if directly\r\ndependent upon the poles. I suppose that the effects are due to a\r\nmodification, by the electric current, of the chemical affinity of the\r\nparticles through or by which that current is passing, giving them the\r\npower of acting more forcibly in one direction than in another, and\r\nconsequently making them travel by a series of successive decompositions\r\nand recompositions in opposite directions, and finally causing their\r\nexpulsion or exclusion at the boundaries of the body under decomposition,\r\nin the direction of the current, _and that_ in larger or smaller\r\nquantities, according as the current is more or less powerful (377.). I\r\nthink, therefore, it would be more philosophical, and more directly\r\nexpressive of the facts, to speak of such a body, in relation to the\r\ncurrent passing through it, rather than to the poles, as they are usually\r\ncalled, in contact with it; and say that whilst under decomposition,\r\noxygen, chlorine, iodine, acids, &c., are rendered at its negative\r\nextremity, and combustibles, metals, alkalies, bases, &c., at its positive\r\nextremity (467.), I do not believe that a substance can be transferred in\r\nthe electric current beyond the point where it ceases to find particles\r\nwith which it can combine; and I may refer to the experiments made in air\r\n(465.) and in water (495.), already quoted, for facts illustrating these\r\nviews in the first instance; to which I will now add others.\r\n\r\n525. In order to show the dependence of the decomposition and transfer of\r\nelements upon the chemical affinity of the substances present, experiments\r\nwere made upon sulphuric acid in the following manner. Dilute sulphuric\r\nacid was prepared: its specific gravity was 1.0212. A solution of sulphate\r\nof soda was also prepared, of such strength that a measure of it contained\r\nexactly as much sulphuric acid as an equal measure of the diluted acid just\r\nreferred to. A solution of pure soda, and another of pure ammonia, were\r\nlikewise prepared, of such strengths that a measure of either should be\r\nexactly neutralized by a measure of the prepared sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n526. Four glass cups were then arranged, as in fig. 55; seventeen measures\r\nof the free sulphuric acid (525.) were put into each of the vessels _a_ and\r\n_b_, and seventeen measures of the solution of sulphate of soda into each\r\nof the vessels A and B. Asbestus, which had been well-washed in acid, acted\r\nupon by the voltaic pile, well-washed in water, and dried by pressure, was\r\nused to connect _a_ with _b_ and A with B, the portions being as equal as\r\nthey could be made in quantity, and cut as short as was consistent with\r\ntheir performing the part of effectual communications, _b_ and A were\r\nconnected by two platina plates or poles soldered to the extremities of one\r\nwire, and the cups _a_ and B were by similar platina plates connected with\r\na voltaic battery of forty pairs of plates four inches square, that in _a_\r\nbeing connected with the negative, and that in B with the positive pole.\r\nThe battery, which was not powerfully charged, was retained in\r\ncommunication above half an hour. In this manner it was certain that the\r\nsame electric current had passed through _a b_ and A B, and that in each\r\ninstance the same quantity and strength of acid had been submitted to its\r\naction, but in one case merely dissolved in water, and in the other\r\ndissolved and also combined with an alkali.\r\n\r\n527. On breaking the connexion with the battery, the portions of asbestus\r\nwere lifted out, and the drops hanging at the ends allowed to fall each\r\ninto its respective vessel. The acids in _a_ and _b_ were then first\r\ncompared, for which purpose two evaporating dishes were balanced, and the\r\nacid from _a_ put into one, and that from _b_ into the other; but as one\r\nwas a little heavier than the other, a small drop was transferred from the\r\nheavier to the lighter, and the two rendered equal in weight. Being\r\nneutralized by the addition of the soda solution (525.), that from _a_, or\r\nthe negative vessel, required 15 parts of the soda solution, and that from\r\n_b_, or the positive vessel, required 16.3 parts. That the sum of these is\r\nnot 34 parts is principally due to the acid removed with the asbestus; but\r\ntaking the mean of 15.65 parts, it would appear that a twenty-fourth part\r\nof the acid originally in the vessel _a_ had passed, through the influence\r\nof the electric current, from _a_ into _b_.\r\n\r\n528. In comparing the difference of acid in A and B, the necessary equality\r\nof weight was considered as of no consequence, because the solution was at\r\nfirst neutral, and would not, therefore, affect the test liquids, and all\r\nthe evolved acid would be in B, and the free alkali in A. The solution in A\r\nrequired 3.2 measures of the prepared acid (525.) to neutralize it, and the\r\nsolution in B required also 3.2 measures of the soda solution (525.) to\r\nneutralize it. As the asbestus must have removed a little acid and alkali\r\nfrom the glasses, these quantities are by so much too small; and therefore\r\nit would appear that about a tenth of the acid originally in the vessel A\r\nhad been transferred into B during the continuance of the electric action.\r\n\r\n529. In another similar experiment, whilst a thirty-fifth part of the acid\r\npassed from _a_ to _b_; in the free acid vessels, between a tenth and an\r\neleventh passed from A to B in the combined acid vessels. Other experiments\r\nof the same kind gave similar results.\r\n\r\n530. The variation of electro-chemical decomposition, the transfer of\r\nelements and their accumulation at the poles, according as the substance\r\nsubmitted to action consists of particles opposed more or less in their\r\nchemical affinity, together with the consequent influence of the latter\r\ncircumstances, are sufficiently obvious in these cases, where sulphuric\r\nacid is acted upon in the _same quantity_ by the _same_ electric current,\r\nbut in one case opposed to the comparatively weak affinity of water for it,\r\nand in the other to the stronger one of soda. In the latter case the\r\nquantity transferred is from two and a half to three times what it is in\r\nthe former; and it appears therefore very evident that the transfer is\r\ngreatly dependent upon the mutual action of the particles of the\r\ndecomposing bodies[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See the note to (675.),--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n531. In some of the experiments the acid from the vessels _a_ and _b_ was\r\nneutralized by ammonia, then evaporated to dryness, heated to redness, and\r\nthe residue examined for sulphates. In these cases more sulphate was always\r\nobtained from _a_ than from _b_; showing that it had been impossible to\r\nexclude saline bases (derived from the asbestus, the glass, or perhaps\r\nimpurities originally in the acid,) and that they had helped in\r\ntransferring the acid into _b_. But the quantity was small, and the acid\r\nwas principally transferred by relation to the water present.\r\n\r\n532. I endeavoured to arrange certain experiments by which saline solutions\r\nshould be decomposed against surfaces of water; and at first worked with\r\nthe electric machine upon a piece of bibulous paper, or asbestus moistened\r\nin the solution, and in contact at its two extremities with pointed pieces\r\nof paper moistened in pure water, which served to carry the electric\r\ncurrent to and from the solution in the middle piece. But I found numerous\r\ninterfering difficulties. Thus, the water and solutions in the pieces of\r\npaper could not be prevented from mingling at the point where they touched.\r\nAgain, sufficient acid could be derived from the paper connected with the\r\ndischarging train, or it may be even from the air itself, under the\r\ninfluence of electric action, to neutralize the alkali developed at the\r\npositive extremity of the decomposing solution, and so not merely prevent\r\nits appearance, but actually transfer it on to the metal termination: and,\r\nin fact, when the paper points were not allowed to touch there, and the\r\nmachine was worked until alkali was evolved at the delivering or positive\r\nend of the turmeric paper, containing the sulphate of soda solution, it was\r\nmerely necessary to place the opposite receiving point of the paper\r\nconnected with the discharging train, which had been moistened by distilled\r\nwater, upon the brown turmeric point and press them together, when the\r\nalkaline effect immediately disappeared.\r\n\r\n533. The experiment with sulphate of magnesia already described (495.) is a\r\ncase in point, however, and shows most clearly that the sulphuric acid and\r\nmagnesia contributed to each other's transfer and final evolution, exactly\r\nas the same acid and soda affected each other in the results just given\r\n(527, &c.); and that so soon as the magnesia advanced beyond the reach of\r\nthe acid, and found no other substance with which it could combine, it\r\nappeared in its proper character, and was no longer able to continue its\r\nprogress towards the negative pole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n534. The theory I have ventured to put forth appears to me to explain all\r\nthe prominent features of electro-chemical decomposition in a satisfactory\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n535. In the first place, it explains why, in all ordinary cases, the\r\nevolved substances _appear only at the poles_; for the poles are the\r\nlimiting surfaces of the decomposing substance, and except at them, every\r\nparticle finds other particles having a contrary tendency with which it can\r\ncombine.\r\n\r\n536. Then it explains why, in numerous cases, the elements or evolved\r\nsubstances are not _retained_ by the poles; and this is no small difficulty\r\nin those theories which refer the decomposing effect directly to the\r\nattractive power of the poles. If, in accordance with the usual theory, a\r\npiece of platina be supposed to have sufficient power to attract a particle\r\nof hydrogen from the particle of oxygen with which it was the instant\r\nbefore combined, there seems no sufficient reason, nor any fact, except\r\nthose to be explained, which show why it should not, according to analogy\r\nwith all ordinary attractive forces, as those of gravitation, magnetism,\r\ncohesion, chemical affinity, &c. _retain_ that particle which it had just\r\nbefore taken from a distance and from previous combination. Yet it does not\r\ndo so, but allows it to escape freely. Nor does this depend upon its\r\nassuming the gaseous state, for acids and alkalies, &c. are left equally at\r\nliberty to diffuse themselves through the fluid surrounding the pole, and\r\nshow no particular tendency to combine with or adhere to the latter. And\r\nthough there are plenty of cases where combination with the pole does take\r\nplace, they do not at all explain the instances of non-combination, and do\r\nnot therefore in their particular action reveal the general principle of\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\n537. But in the theory that I have just given, the effect appears to be a\r\nnatural consequence of the action: the evolved substances are _expelled_\r\nfrom the decomposing mass (518. 519.), not _drawn out by an attraction_\r\nwhich ceases to act on one particle without any assignable reason, while it\r\ncontinues to act on another of the same kind: and whether the poles be\r\nmetal, water, or air, still the substances are evolved, and are sometimes\r\nset free, whilst at others they unite to the matter of the poles, according\r\nto the chemical nature of the latter, i.e. their chemical relation to those\r\nparticles which are leaving the substance under operation.\r\n\r\n538. The theory accounts for the _transfer of elements_ in a manner which\r\nseems to me at present to leave nothing unexplained; and it was, indeed,\r\nthe phenomena of transfer in the numerous cases of decomposition of bodies\r\nrendered fluid by heat (380. 402.), which, in conjunction with the\r\nexperiments in air, led to its construction. Such cases as the former where\r\nbinary compounds of easy decomposability are acted upon, are perhaps the\r\nbest to illustrate the theory.\r\n\r\n539. Chloride of lead, for instance, fused in a bent tube (400.), and\r\ndecomposed by platina wires, evolves lead, passing to what is usually\r\ncalled the negative pole, and chlorine, which being evolved at the positive\r\npole, is in part set free, and in part combines with the platina. The\r\nchloride of platina formed, being soluble in the chloride of lead, is\r\nsubject to decomposition, and the platina itself is gradually transferred\r\nacross the decomposing matter, and found with the lead at the negative\r\npole.\r\n\r\n540. Iodide of lead evolves abundance of lead at the negative pole, and\r\nabundance of iodine at the positive pole.\r\n\r\n541. Chloride of silver furnishes a beautiful instance, especially when\r\ndecomposed by silver wire poles. Upon fusing a portion of it on a piece of\r\nglass, and bringing the poles into contact with it, there is abundance of\r\nsilver evolved at the negative pole, and an equal abundance absorbed at the\r\npositive pole, for no chlorine is set free: and by careful management, the\r\nnegative wire may be withdrawn from the fused globule as the silver is\r\nreduced there, the latter serving as the continuation of the pole, until a\r\nwire or thread of revived silver, five or six inches in length, is\r\nproduced; at the same time the silver at the positive pole is as rapidly\r\ndissolved by the chlorine, which seizes upon it, so that the wire has to be\r\ncontinually advanced as it is melted away. The whole experiment includes\r\nthe action of only two elements, silver and chlorine, and illustrates in a\r\nbeautiful manner their progress in opposite directions, parallel to the\r\nelectric current, which is for the time giving a uniform general direction\r\nto their mutual affinities (524.).\r\n\r\n542. According to my theory, an element or a substance not decomposable\r\nunder the circumstances of the experiment, (as for instance, a dilute acid\r\nor alkali,) should not be transferred, or pass from pole to pole, unless it\r\nbe in chemical relation to some other element or substance tending to pass\r\nin the opposite direction, for the effect is considered as essentially due\r\nto the mutual relation of such particles. But the theories attributing the\r\ndetermination of the elements to the attractions and repulsions of the\r\npoles require no such condition, i.e. there is no reason apparent why the\r\nattraction of the positive pole, and the repulsion of the negative pole,\r\nupon a particle of free acid, placed in water between them, should not\r\n(with equal currents of electricity) be as strong as if that particle were\r\npreviously combined with alkali; but, on the contrary, as they have not a\r\npowerful chemical affinity to overcome, there is every reason to suppose\r\nthey would be stronger, and would sooner bring the acid to rest at the\r\npositive pole[A]. Yet such is not the case, as has been shown by the\r\nexperiments on free and combined acid (526. 528.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Even Sir Humphry Davy considered the attraction of the pole as\r\n  being communicated from one particle to another of the _same_ kind\r\n  (483.).\r\n\r\n543. Neither does M. de la Rive's theory, as I understand it, _require_\r\nthat the particles should be in combination: it does not even admit, where\r\nthere are two sets of particles capable of combining with and passing by\r\neach other, that they do combine, but supposes that they travel as separate\r\ncompounds of matter and electricity. Yet in fact the free substance\r\n_cannot_ travel, the combined one _can_.\r\n\r\n544. It is very difficult to find cases amongst solutions or fluids which\r\nshall illustrate this point, because of the difficulty of finding two\r\nfluids which shall conduct, shall not mingle, and in which an element\r\nevolved from one shall not find a combinable element in the other.\r\n_Solutions_ of acids or alkalies will not answer, because they exist by\r\nvirtue of an attraction; and increasing the solubility of a body in one\r\ndirection, and diminishing it in the opposite, is just as good a reason for\r\ntransfer, as modifying the affinity between the acids and alkalies\r\nthemselves[A]. Nevertheless the case of sulphate of magnesia is in point\r\n(494. 495.), and shows that _one element or principle only_ has no power of\r\ntransference or of passing towards either pole.\r\n\r\n  [A] See the note to (670.).--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n545. Many of the metals, however, in their solid state, offer very fair\r\ninstances of the kind required. Thus, if a plate of platina be used as the\r\npositive pole in a solution of sulphuric acid, oxygen will pass towards it,\r\nand so will acid; but these are not substances having such chemical\r\nrelation to the platina as, even under the favourable condition\r\nsuperinduced by the current (518. 524.), to combine with it; the platina\r\ntherefore remains where it was first placed, and has no tendency to pass\r\ntowards the negative pole. But if a plate of iron, zinc or copper, be\r\nsubstituted for the platina, then the oxygen and acid can combine with\r\nthese, and the metal immediately begins to travel (as an oxide) to the\r\nopposite pole, and is finally deposited there. Or if, retaining the platina\r\npole, a fused chloride, as of lead, zinc, silver, &c., be substituted for\r\nthe sulphuric acid, then, as the platina finds an element it can combine\r\nwith, it enters into union, acts as other elements do in cases of voltaic\r\ndecomposition, is rapidly transferred across the melted matter, and\r\nexpelled at the negative pole.\r\n\r\n546. I can see but little reason in the theories referring the\r\nelectro-chemical decomposition to the attractions and repulsions of the\r\npoles, and I can perceive none in M. de la Rive's theory, why the metal of\r\nthe positive pole should not be transferred across the intervening\r\nconductor, and deposited at the negative pole, even when it cannot act\r\nchemically upon the element of the fluid surrounding it. It cannot be\r\nreferred to the attraction of cohesion preventing such an effect; for if\r\nthe pole be made of the lightest spongy platina, the effect is the same. Or\r\nif gold precipitated by sulphate of iron be diffused through the solution,\r\nstill accumulation of it at the negative pole will not take place; and yet\r\nthe attraction of cohesion is almost perfectly overcome, the particles are\r\nin it so small as to remain for hours in suspension, and are perfectly free\r\nto move by the slightest impulse towards either pole; and _if in relation_\r\nby chemical affinity to any substance present, are powerfully determined to\r\nthe negative pole[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In making this experiment, care must be taken that no substance be\r\n  present that can act chemically on the gold. Although I used the metal\r\n  very carefully washed, and diffused through dilute sulphuric acid, yet\r\n  in the first instance I obtained gold at the negative pole, and the\r\n  effect was repeated when the platina poles were changed. But on\r\n  examining the clear liquor in the cell, after subsidence of the\r\n  metallic gold, I found a little of that metal in solution, and a\r\n  little chlorine was also present. I therefore well washed the gold\r\n  which had thus been subjected to voltaic action, diffused it through\r\n  other pure dilute sulphuric acid, and then found, that on subjecting\r\n  it to the action of the pile, not the slightest tendency to the\r\n  negative pole could be perceived.\r\n\r\n547. In support of these arguments, it may be observed, that as yet no\r\ndetermination of a substance to a pole, or tendency to obey the electric\r\ncurrent, has been observed (that I am aware of,) in cases of mere mixture;\r\ni.e. a substance diffused through a fluid, but having no sensible chemical\r\naffinity with it, or with substances that may be evolved from it during the\r\naction, does not in any case seem to be affected by the electric current.\r\nPulverised charcoal was diffused through dilute sulphuric acid, and\r\nsubjected with the solution to the action of a voltaic battery, terminated\r\nby platina poles; but not the slightest tendency of the charcoal to the\r\nnegative pole could be observed, Sublimed sulphur was diffused through\r\nsimilar acid, and submitted to the same action, a silver plate being used\r\nas the negative pole; but the sulphur had no tendency to pass to that pole,\r\nthe silver was not tarnished, nor did any sulphuretted hydrogen appear. The\r\ncase of magnesia and water (495. 533.), with those of comminuted metals in\r\ncertain solutions (546.), are also of this kind; and, in fact, substances\r\nwhich have the instant before been powerfully determined towards the pole,\r\nas magnesia from sulphate of magnesia, become entirely _indifferent to it_\r\nthe moment they assume their independent state, and pass away, diffusing\r\nthemselves through the surrounding fluid.\r\n\r\n548. There are, it is true, many instances of insoluble bodies being acted\r\nupon, as glass, sulphate of baryta, marble, slate, basalt, &c., but they\r\nform no exception; for the substances they give up are in direct and strong\r\nrelation as to chemical affinity with those which they find in the\r\nsurrounding solution, so that these decompositions enter into the class of\r\nordinary effects.\r\n\r\n549. It may be expressed as a general consequence, that the more directly\r\nbodies are opposed to each other in chemical affinity, the more _ready_ is\r\ntheir separation from each other in cases of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition, i.e. provided other circumstances, as insolubility,\r\ndeficient conducting power, proportions, &c., do not interfere. This is\r\nwell known to be the case with water and saline solutions; and I have found\r\nit to be equally true with _dry_ chlorides, iodides, salts, &c., rendered\r\nsubject to electro-chemical decomposition by fusion (402.). So that in\r\napplying the voltaic battery for the purpose of decomposing bodies not yet\r\nresolved into forms of matter simpler than their own, it must be\r\nremembered, that success may depend not upon the weakness, or failure upon\r\nthe strength, of the affinity by which the elements sought for are held\r\ntogether, but contrariwise; and then modes of application may be devised,\r\nby which, in _association_ with ordinary chemical powers, and the\r\nassistance of fusion (394. 417.), we may be able to penetrate much further\r\nthan at present into the constitution of our chemical elements.\r\n\r\n550. Some of the most beautiful and surprising cases of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition and _transfer_ which Sir Humphry Davy described in his\r\ncelebrated paper[A], were those in which acids were passed through\r\nalkalies, and alkalies or earths through acids[B]; and the way in which\r\nsubstances having the most powerful attractions for each other were thus\r\nprevented from combining, or, as it is said, had their natural affinity\r\ndestroyed or suspended throughout the whole of the circuit, excited the\r\nutmost astonishment. But if I be right in the view I have taken of the\r\neffects, it will appear, that that which made the _wonder_, is in fact the\r\n_essential condition_ of transfer and decomposition, and that the more\r\nalkali there is in the course of an acid, the more will the transfer of\r\nthat acid be facilitated from pole to pole; and perhaps a better\r\nillustration of the difference between the theory I have ventured, and\r\nthose previously existing, cannot be offered than the views they\r\nrespectively give of such facts as these.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1807, p. 1.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. p, 24, &c.\r\n\r\n551. The instances in which sulphuric acid could not be passed though\r\nbaryta, or baryta through sulphuric acid[A], because of the precipitation\r\nof sulphate of baryta, enter within the pale of the law already described\r\n(380. 412.), by which liquidity is so generally required for conduction and\r\ndecomposition. In assuming the solid state of sulphate of baryta, these\r\nbodies became virtually non-conductors to electricity of so low a tension\r\nas that of the voltaic battery, and the power of the latter over them was\r\nalmost infinitely diminished.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1807, p. 25, &c.\r\n\r\n552. The theory I have advanced accords in a most satisfactory manner with\r\nthe fact of an element or substance finding its place of rest, or rather of\r\nevolution, sometimes at one pole and sometimes at the other. Sulphur\r\nillustrates this effect very well[A]. When sulphuric acid is decomposed by\r\nthe pile, sulphur is evolved at the negative pole; but when sulphuret of\r\nsilver is decomposed in a similar way (436.), then the sulphur appears at\r\nthe positive pole; and if a hot platina pole be used so as to vaporize the\r\nsulphur evolved in the latter case, then the relation of that pole to the\r\nsulphur is exactly the same as the relation of the same pole to oxygen upon\r\nits immersion in water. In both cases the element evolved is liberated at\r\nthe pole, but not retained by it; but by virtue of its elastic,\r\nuncombinable, and immiscible condition passes away into the surrounding\r\nmedium. The sulphur is evidently determined in these opposite directions by\r\nits opposite chemical relations to oxygen and silver; and it is to such\r\nrelations generally that I have referred all electro-chemical phenomena.\r\nWhere they do not exist, no electro-chemical action can take place. Where\r\nthey are strongest, it is most powerful; where they are reversed, the\r\ndirection of transfer of the substance is reversed with them.\r\n\r\n  [A] At 681 and 757 of Series VII, will be found corrections of the\r\n  statement here made respecting sulphur and sulphuric acid. At present\r\n  there is no well-ascertained fact which proves that the same body can\r\n  go directly to _either_ of the two poles at pleasure.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n553. _Water_ may be considered as one of those substances which can be made\r\nto pass to _either_ pole. When the poles are immersed in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid (527.), acid passes towards the positive pole, and water towards the\r\nnegative pole; but when they are immersed in dilute alkali, the alkali\r\npasses towards the negative pole, and water towards the positive pole.\r\n\r\n554. Nitrogen is another substance which is considered as determinable to\r\neither pole; but in consequence of the numerous compounds which it forms,\r\nsome of which pass to one pole, and some to the other, I have not always\r\nfound it easy to determine the true circumstances of its appearance. A pure\r\nstrong solution of ammonia is so bad a conductor of electricity that it is\r\nscarcely more decomposable than pure water; but if sulphate of ammonia be\r\ndissolved in it, then decomposition takes place very well; nitrogen almost\r\npure, and in some cases quite, is evolved at the positive pole, and\r\nhydrogen at the negative pole.\r\n\r\n555. On the other hand, if a strong solution of nitrate of ammonia be\r\ndecomposed, oxygen appears at the positive pole, and hydrogen, with\r\nsometimes nitrogen, at the negative pole. If fused nitrate of ammonia be\r\nemployed, hydrogen appears at the negative pole, mingled with a little\r\nnitrogen. Strong nitric acid yields plenty of oxygen at the positive pole,\r\nbut no gas (only nitrous acid) at the negative pole. Weak nitric acid\r\nyields the oxygen and hydrogen of the water present, the acid apparently\r\nremaining unchanged. Strong nitric acid with nitrate of ammonia dissolved\r\nin it, yields a gas at the negative pole, of which the greater part is\r\nhydrogen, but apparently a little nitrogen is present. I believe, that in\r\nsome of these cases a little nitrogen appeared at the negative pole. I\r\nsuspect, however, that in all these, and in all former cases, the\r\nappearance of the nitrogen at the positive or negative pole is entirely a\r\nsecondary effect, and not an immediate consequence of the decomposing power\r\nof the electric current[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Refer for proof of the truth of this supposition to 748, 752,\r\n  &c.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n556. A few observations on what are called the _poles_ of the voltaic\r\nbattery now seem necessary. The poles are merely the surfaces or doors by\r\nwhich the electricity enters into or passes out of the substance suffering\r\ndecomposition. They limit the extent of that substance in the course of the\r\nelectric current, being its _terminations_ in that direction: Hence the\r\nelements evolved pass so far and no further.\r\n\r\n557. Metals make admirable poles, in consequence of their high conducting\r\npower, their immiscibility with the substances generally acted upon, their\r\nsolid form, and the opportunity afforded of selecting such as are not\r\nchemically acted upon by ordinary substances.\r\n\r\n558. Water makes a pole of difficult application, except in a few cases\r\n(494.), because of its small conducting power, its miscibility with most of\r\nthe substances acted upon, and its general relation to them in respect to\r\nchemical affinity. It consists of elements, which in their electrical and\r\nchemical relations are directly and powerfully opposed, yet combining to\r\nproduce a body more neutral in its character than any other. So that there\r\nare but few substances which do not come into relation, by chemical\r\naffinity, with water or one of its elements; and therefore either the water\r\nor its elements are transferred and assist in transferring the infinite\r\nvariety of bodies which, in association with it, can be placed in the\r\ncourse of the electric current. Hence the reason why it so rarely happens\r\nthat the evolved substances rest at the first surface of the water, and why\r\nit therefore does not exhibit the ordinary action of a pole.\r\n\r\n559. Air, however, and some gases are free from the latter objection, and\r\nmay be used as poles in many cases (461, &c.); but, in consequence of the\r\nextremely low degree of conducting power belonging to them, they cannot be\r\nemployed with the voltaic apparatus. This limits their use; for the voltaic\r\napparatus is the only one as yet discovered which supplies sufficient\r\nquantity of electricity (371. 376.) to effect electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition with facility.\r\n\r\n560. When the poles are liable to the chemical action of the substances\r\nevolved, either simply in consequence of their natural relation to them, or\r\nof that relation aided by the influence of the current (518.), then they\r\nsuffer corrosion, and the parts dissolved are subject to transference, in\r\nthe same manner as the particles of the body originally under\r\ndecomposition. An immense series of phenomena of this kind might be quoted\r\nin support of the view I have taken of the cause of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition, and the transfer and evolution of the elements. Thus platina\r\nbeing made the positive and negative poles in a solution of sulphate of\r\nsoda, has no affinity or attraction for the oxygen, hydrogen, acid, or\r\nalkali evolved, and refuses to combine with or retain them. Zinc can\r\ncombine with the oxygen and acid; at the positive pole it does combine, and\r\nimmediately begins to travel as oxide towards the negative pole. Charcoal,\r\nwhich cannot combine with the metals, if made the negative pole in a\r\nmetallic solution, refuses to unite to the bodies which are ejected from\r\nthe solution upon its surface; but if made the positive pole in a dilute\r\nsolution of sulphuric acid, it is capable of combining with the oxygen\r\nevolved there, and consequently unites with it, producing both carbonic\r\nacid and carbonic oxide in abundance.\r\n\r\n561. A great advantage is frequently supplied, by the opportunity afforded\r\namongst the metals of selecting a substance for the pole, which shall or\r\nshall not be acted upon by the elements to be evolved. The consequent use\r\nof platina is notorious. In the decomposition of sulphuret of silver and\r\nother sulphurets, a positive silver pole is superior to a platina one,\r\nbecause in the former case the sulphur evolved there combines with the\r\nsilver, and the decomposition of the original sulphuret is rendered\r\nevident; whereas in the latter case it is dissipated, and the assurance of\r\nits separation at the pole not easily obtained.\r\n\r\n562. The effects which take place when a succession of conducting\r\ndecomposable and undecomposable substances are placed in the electric\r\ncircuit, as, for instance, of wires and solutions, or of air and solutions\r\n(465, 469.), are explained in the simplest possible manner by the\r\ntheoretical view I have given. In consequence of the reaction of the\r\nconstituents of each portion of decomposable matter, affected as they are\r\nby the supervention of the electric current (524.), portions of the\r\nproximate or ultimate elements proceed in the direction of the current as\r\nfar as they find matter of a contrary kind capable of effecting their\r\ntransfer, and being equally affected by them; and where they cease to find\r\nsuch matter, they are evolved in their free state, i.e. upon the surfaces\r\nof metal or air bounding the extent of decomposable matter in the direction\r\nof the current.\r\n\r\n563. Having thus given my theory of the mode in which electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition is effected, I will refrain for the present from entering\r\nupon the numerous general considerations which it suggests, wishing first\r\nto submit it to the test of publication and discussion.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nJune 1833._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. _On the power of Metals and other Solids to induce the Combination\r\nof Gaseous Bodies._\r\n\r\nReceived November 30, 1833,--Read January 11, 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\n564. The conclusion at which I have arrived in the present communication\r\nmay seem to render the whole of it unfit to form part of a series of\r\nresearches in electricity; since, remarkable as the phenomena are, the\r\npower which produces them is not to be considered as of an electric origin,\r\notherwise than as all attraction of particles may have this subtile agent\r\nfor their common cause. But as the effects investigated arose out of\r\nelectrical researches, as they are directly connected with other effects\r\nwhich are of an electric nature, and must of necessity be understood and\r\nguarded against in a very extensive series of electro-chemical\r\ndecompositions (707.), I have felt myself fully justified in describing\r\nthem in this place.\r\n\r\n565. Believing that I had proved (by experiments hereafter to be described\r\n(705.),) the constant and definite chemical action of a certain quantity of\r\nelectricity, whatever its intensity might be, or however the circumstances\r\nof its transmission through either the body under decomposition or the more\r\nperfect conductors were varied, I endeavoured upon that result to construct\r\na new measuring instrument, which from its use might be called, at least\r\nprovisionally, a _Volta-electrometer_ (739.)[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Or Voltameter.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n566. During the course of the experiments made to render the instrument\r\nefficient, I was occasionally surprised at observing a deficiency of the\r\ngases resulting from the decompositions of water, and at last an actual\r\ndisappearance of portions which had been evolved, collected, and measured.\r\nThe circumstances of the disappearance were these. A glass tube, about\r\ntwelve inches in length and 3/4ths of an inch in diameter, had two platina\r\npoles fixed into its upper, hermetically sealed, extremity: the poles,\r\nwhere they passed through the glass, were of wire; but terminated below in\r\nplates, which were soldered to the wires with gold (Plate V. fig. 56.). The\r\ntube was filled with dilute sulphuric acid, and inverted in a cup of the\r\nsame fluid; a voltaic battery was connected with the two wires, and\r\nsufficient oxygen and hydrogen evolved to occupy 4/5ths of the tube, or by\r\nthe graduation, 116 parts. On separating the tube from the voltaic battery\r\nthe volume of gas immediately began to diminish, and in about five hours\r\nonly 13-1/2 parts remained, and these ultimately disappeared.\r\n\r\n567. It was found by various experiments, that this effect was not due to\r\nthe escape or solution of the gas, nor to recombination of the oxygen or\r\nhydrogen in consequence of any peculiar condition _they_ might be supposed\r\nto possess under the circumstances; but to be occasioned by the action of\r\none or both of the poles within the tube upon the gas around them. On\r\ndisuniting the poles from the pile after they had acted upon dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, and introducing them into separate tubes containing mixed\r\noxygen and hydrogen, it was found that the _positive_ pole effected the\r\nunion of the gases, but the negative pole apparently not (588.). It was\r\nascertained also that no action of a sensible kind took place between the\r\npositive pole with oxygen or hydrogen alone.\r\n\r\n568. These experiments reduced the phenomena to the consequence of a power\r\npossessed by the platina, after it had been the positive pole of a voltaic\r\npile, of causing the combination of oxygen and hydrogen at common, or even\r\nat low, temperatures. This effect is, as far as I am aware, altogether new,\r\nand was immediately followed out to ascertain whether it was really of an\r\nelectric nature, and how far it would interfere with the determination of\r\nthe quantities evolved in the cases of electro-chemical decomposition\r\nrequired in the fourteenth section of these Researches.\r\n\r\n569. Several platina plates were prepared (fig. 57.). They were nearly half\r\nan inch wide, and two inches and a half long: some were 1/200dth of an\r\ninch, others not more than 1/600dth, whilst some were as much as 1/70th of\r\nan inch in thickness. Each had a piece of platina wire, about seven inches\r\nlong, soldered to it by pure gold. Then a number of glass tubes were\r\nprepared: they were about nine or ten inches in length, 5/8ths of an inch\r\nin internal diameter, were sealed hermetically at one extremity, and were\r\ngraduated. Into these tubes was put a mixture of two volumes of hydrogen\r\nand one of oxygen, at the water pneumatic trough, and when one of the\r\nplates described had been connected with the positive or negative pole of\r\nthe voltaic battery for a given time, or had been otherwise prepared, it\r\nwas introduced through the water into the gas within the tube; the whole\r\nset aside in a test-glass (fig. 58.), and left for a longer or shorter\r\nperiod, that the action might be observed.\r\n\r\n570. The following result may be given as an illustration of the phenomenon\r\nto be investigated. Diluted sulphuric acid, of the specific gravity 1.336,\r\nwas put into a glass jar, in which was placed also a large platina plate,\r\nconnected with the negative end of a voltaic battery of forty pairs of\r\nfour-inch plates, with double coppers, and moderately charged. One of the\r\nplates above described (569.) was then connected with the positive\r\nextremity, and immersed in the same jar of acid for five minutes, after\r\nwhich it was separated from the battery, washed in distilled water, and\r\nintroduced through the water of the pneumatic trough into a tube containing\r\nthe mixture of oxygen and hydrogen (569.). The volume of gases immediately\r\nbegan to lessen, the diminution proceeding more and more rapidly until\r\nabout 3/4ths of the mixture had disappeared. The upper end of the tube\r\nbecame quite warm, the plate itself so hot that the water boiled as it rose\r\nover it; and in less than a minute a cubical inch and a half of the gases\r\nwere gone, having been combined by the power of the platina, and converted\r\ninto water.\r\n\r\n571. This extraordinary influence acquired by the platina at the positive\r\npole of the pile, is exerted far more readily and effectively on oxygen and\r\nhydrogen than on any other mixture of gases that I have tried. One volume\r\nof nitrous gas was mixed with a volume of hydrogen, and introduced into a\r\ntube with a plate which had been made positive in the dilute sulphuric acid\r\nfor four minutes (570.). There was no sensible action in an hour: being\r\nleft for thirty-six hours, there was a diminution of about one-eighth of\r\nthe whole volume. Action had taken place, but it had been very feeble.\r\n\r\n572. A mixture of two volumes of nitrous oxide with one volume of hydrogen\r\nwas put with a plate similarly prepared into a tube (569. 570.). This also\r\nshowed no action immediately; but in thirty-six hours nearly a fourth of\r\nthe whole had disappeared, i.e. about half of a cubic inch. By comparison\r\nwith another tube containing the same mixture without a plate, it appeared\r\nthat a part of the diminution was due to solution, and the other part to\r\nthe power of the platina; but the action had been very slow and feeble.\r\n\r\n573. A mixture of one volume olefiant gas and three volumes oxygen was not\r\naffected by such a platina plate, even though left together for several\r\ndays (640. 641.).\r\n\r\n574. A mixture of two volumes carbonic oxide and one volume oxygen was also\r\nunaffected by the prepared platina plate in several days (645, &c.).\r\n\r\n575. A mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen was used in\r\nseveral experiments, with plates prepared in a similar manner (570.).\r\nDiminution of bulk soon took place; but when after thirty-six hours the\r\nexperiments were examined, it was found that nearly all the chlorine had\r\ndisappeared, having been absorbed, principally by the water, and that the\r\noriginal volume of hydrogen remained unchanged. No combination of the\r\ngases, therefore, had here taken place.\r\n\r\n576. Reverting to the action of the prepared plates on mixtures of oxygen\r\nand hydrogen (570.), I found that the power, though gradually diminishing\r\nin all cases, could still be retained for a period, varying in its length\r\nwith circumstances. When tubes containing plates (569.) were supplied with\r\nfresh portions of mixed oxygen and hydrogen as the previous portions were\r\ncondensed, the action was found to continue for above thirty hours, and in\r\nsome cases slow combination could be observed even after eighty hours; but\r\nthe continuance of the action greatly depended upon the purity of the gases\r\nused (638.).\r\n\r\n577. Some plates (569.) were made positive for four minutes in dilute\r\nsulphuric acid of specific gravity 1.336: they were rinsed in distilled\r\nwater, after which two were put into a small bottle and closed up, whilst\r\nothers were left exposed to the air. The plates preserved in the limited\r\nportion of air were found to retain their power after eight days, but those\r\nexposed to the atmosphere had lost their force almost entirely in twelve\r\nhours, and in some situations, where currents existed, in a much shorter\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n578. Plates were made positive for five minutes in sulphuric acid, specific\r\ngravity 1.336. One of these was retained in similar acid for eight minutes\r\nafter separation from the battery: it then acted on mixed oxygen and\r\nhydrogen with apparently undiminished vigour. Others were left in similar\r\nacid for forty hours, and some even for eight days, after the\r\nelectrization, and then acted as well in combining oxygen and hydrogen gas\r\nas those which were used immediately after electrization.\r\n\r\n579. The effect of a solution of caustic potassa in preserving the platina\r\nplates was tried in a similar manner. After being retained in such a\r\nsolution for forty hours, they acted exceedingly well on oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, and one caused such rapid condensation of the gases, that the\r\nplate became much heated, and I expected the temperature would have risen\r\nto ignition.\r\n\r\n580. When similarly prepared plates (569.) had been put into distilled\r\nwater for forty hours, and then introduced into mixed oxygen and hydrogen,\r\nthey were found to act but very slowly and feebly as compared with those\r\nwhich had been preserved in acid or alkali. When, however, the quantity of\r\nwater was but small, the power was very little impaired after three or four\r\ndays. As the water had been retained in a wooden vessel, portions of it\r\nwere redistilled in glass, and this was found to preserve prepared plates\r\nfor a great length of time. Prepared plates were put into tubes with this\r\nwater and closed up; some of them, taken out at the end of twenty-four\r\ndays, were found very active on mixed oxygen and hydrogen; others, which\r\nwere left in the water for fifty-three days, were still found to cause the\r\ncombination of the gases. The tubes had been closed only by corks.\r\n\r\n581. The act of combination always seemed to diminish, or apparently\r\nexhaust, the power of the platina plate. It is true, that in most, if not\r\nall instances, the combination of the gases, at first insensible, gradually\r\nincreased in rapidity, and sometimes reached to explosion; but when the\r\nlatter did not happen, the rapidity of combination diminished; and although\r\nfresh portions of gas were introduced into the tubes, the combination went\r\non more and more slowly, and at last ceased altogether. The first effect of\r\nan increase in the rapidity of combination depended in part upon the water\r\nflowing off from the platina plate, and allowing a better contact with the\r\ngas, and in part upon the heat evolved during the progress of the\r\ncombination (630.). But notwithstanding the effect of these causes,\r\ndiminution, and at last cessation of the power, always occurred. It must\r\nnot, however, be unnoticed, that the purer the gases subjected to the\r\naction of the plate, the longer was its combining power retained. With the\r\nmixture evolved at the poles of the voltaic pile, in pure dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, it continued longest; and with oxygen and hydrogen, of perfect\r\npurity, it probably would not be diminished at all.\r\n\r\n582. Different modes of treatment applied to the platina plate, after it\r\nhad ceased to be the positive pole of the pile, affected its power very\r\ncuriously. A plate which had been a positive pole in diluted sulphuric acid\r\nof specific gravity 1.336 for four or five minutes, if rinsed in water and\r\nput into mixed oxygen and hydrogen, would act very well, and condense\r\nperhaps one cubic inch and a half of gas in six or seven minutes; but if\r\nthat same plate, instead of being merely rinsed, had been left in distilled\r\nwater for twelve or fifteen minutes, or more, it would rarely fail, when\r\nput into the oxygen and hydrogen, of becoming, in the course of a minute or\r\ntwo, ignited, and would generally explode the gases. Occasionally the time\r\noccupied in bringing on the action extended to eight or nine minutes, and\r\nsometimes even to forty minutes, and yet ignition and explosion would\r\nresult. This effect is due to the removal of a portion of acid which\r\notherwise adheres firmly to the plate [A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In proof that this is the case, refer to 1038.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n583. Occasionally the platina plates (569.), after being made the positive\r\npole of the battery, were washed, wiped with filtering-paper or a cloth,\r\nand washed and wiped again. Being then introduced into mixed oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, they acted apparently as if they had been unaffected by the\r\ntreatment. Sometimes the tubes containing the gas were opened in the air\r\nfor an instant, and the plates put in dry; but no sensible difference in\r\naction was perceived, except that it commenced sooner.\r\n\r\n584. The power of heat in altering the action of the prepared platina\r\nplates was also tried (595.). Plates which had been rendered positive in\r\ndilute sulphuric acid for four minutes were well-washed in water, and\r\nheated to redness in the flame of a spirit-lamp: after this they acted very\r\nwell on mixed oxygen and hydrogen. Others, which had been heated more\r\npowerfully by the blowpipe, acted afterwards on the gases, though not so\r\npowerfully as the former. Hence it appears that heat does not take away the\r\npower acquired by the platina at the positive pole of the pile: the\r\noccasional diminution of force seemed always referable to other causes than\r\nthe mere heat. If, for instance, the plate had not been well-washed from\r\nthe acid, or if the flame used was carbonaceous, or was that of an alcohol\r\nlamp trimmed with spirit containing a little acid, or having a wick on\r\nwhich salt, or other extraneous matter, had been placed, then the power of\r\nthe plate was quickly and greatly diminished (634. 636.).\r\n\r\n585. This remarkable property was conferred upon platina when it was made\r\nthe positive pole in sulphuric acid of specific gravity 1.336, or when it\r\nwas considerably weaker, or when stronger, even up to the strength of oil\r\nof vitriol. Strong and dilute nitric acid, dilute acetic acid, solutions of\r\ntartaric, citric, and oxalic acids, were used with equal success. When\r\nmuriatic acid was used, the plates acquired the power of condensing the\r\noxygen and hydrogen, but in a much inferior degree.\r\n\r\n586. Plates which were made positive in solution of caustic potassa did not\r\nshow any sensible action upon the mixed oxygen and hydrogen. Other plates\r\nmade positive in solutions of carbonates of potassa and soda exhibited the\r\naction, but only in a feeble degree.\r\n\r\n587. When a neutral solution of sulphate of soda, or of nitre, or of\r\nchlorate of potassa, or of phosphate of potassa, or acetate of potassa, or\r\nsulphate of copper, was used, the plates, rendered positive in them for\r\nfour minutes, and then washed in water, acted very readily and powerfully\r\non the mixed oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n588. It became a very important point, in reference to the _cause_ of this\r\naction of the platina, to determine whether the _positive_ pole _only_\r\ncould confer it (567.), or whether, notwithstanding the numerous contrary\r\ncases, the _negative_ pole might not have the power when such circumstances\r\nas could interfere with or prevent the action were avoided. Three plates\r\nwere therefore rendered negative, for four minutes in diluted sulphuric\r\nacid of specific gravity 1.336, washed in distilled water, and put into\r\nmixed oxygen and hydrogen. _All_ of them _acted_, though not so strongly as\r\nthey would have done if they had been rendered positive. Each combined\r\nabout a cubical inch and a quarter of the gases in twenty-five minutes. On\r\nevery repetition of the experiment the same result was obtained; and when\r\nthe plates were retained in distilled water for ten or twelve minutes,\r\nbefore being introduced into the gas (582.), the action was very much\r\nquickened.\r\n\r\n589. But when there was any metallic or other substance present in the\r\nacid, which could be precipitated on the negative plate, then that plate\r\nceased to act upon the mixed oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n590. These experiments led to the expectation that the power of causing\r\noxygen and hydrogen to combine, which could be conferred upon any piece of\r\nplatina by making it the positive pole of a voltaic pile, was not\r\nessentially dependent upon the action of the pile, or upon any structure or\r\narrangement of parts it might receive whilst in association with it, but\r\nbelonged to the platina _at all times_, and was _always effective_ when the\r\nsurface was _perfectly clean_. And though, when made the _positive_ pole of\r\nthe pile in acids, the circumstances might well be considered as those\r\nwhich would cleanse the surface of the platina in the most effectual\r\nmanner, it did not seem impossible that ordinary operations should produce\r\nthe same result, although in a less eminent degree.\r\n\r\n591. Accordingly, a platina plate (569.) was cleaned by being rubbed with a\r\ncork, a little water, and some coal-fire ashes upon a glass plate: being\r\nwashed, it was put into mixed oxygen and hydrogen, and was found to act at\r\nfirst slowly, and then more rapidly. In an hour, a cubical inch and a half\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\n592. Other plates were cleaned with ordinary sand-paper and water; others\r\nwith chalk and water; others with emery and water; others, again, with\r\nblack oxide of manganese and water; and others with a piece of charcoal and\r\nwater. All of these acted in tubes of oxygen and hydrogen, causing\r\ncombination of the gases. The action was by no means so powerful as that\r\nproduced by plates having been in communication with the battery; but from\r\none to two cubical inches of the gases disappeared, in periods extending\r\nfrom twenty-five to eighty or ninety minutes.\r\n\r\n593. Upon cleaning the plates with a cork, ground emery, and dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, they were found to act still better. In order to simplify\r\nthe conditions, the cork was dismissed, and a piece of platina foil used\r\ninstead; still the effect took place. Then the acid was dismissed, and a\r\nsolution of _potassa_ used, but the effect occurred as before.\r\n\r\n594. These results are abundantly sufficient to show that the mere\r\nmechanical cleansing of the surface of the platina is sufficient to enable\r\nit to exert its combining power over oxygen and hydrogen at common\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\n595. I now tried the effect of heat in conferring this property upon\r\nplatina (584.). Plates which had no action on the mixture of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen were heated by the flame of a freshly trimmed spirit-lamp, urged\r\nby a mouth blowpipe, and when cold were put into tubes of the mixed gases:\r\nthey acted slowly at first, but after two or three hours condensed nearly\r\nall the gases.\r\n\r\n596. A plate of platina, which was about one inch wide and two and\r\nthree-quarters in length, and which had not been used in any of the\r\npreceding experiments, was curved a little so as to enter a tube, and left\r\nin a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen for thirteen hours: not the slightest\r\naction or combination of the gases occurred. It was withdrawn at the\r\npneumatic trough from the gas through the water, heated red-hot by the\r\nspirit-lamp and blowpipe, and then returned when cold into the _same_\r\nportion of gas. In the course of a few minutes diminution of the gases\r\ncould be observed, and in forty-five minutes about one cubical inch and a\r\nquarter had disappeared. In many other experiments platina plates when\r\nheated were found to acquire the power of combining oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n597. But it happened not infrequently that plates, after being heated,\r\nshowed no power of combining oxygen and hydrogen gases, though left\r\nundisturbed in them for two hours. Sometimes also it would happen that a\r\nplate which, having been heated to dull redness, acted feebly, upon being\r\nheated to whiteness ceased to act; and at other times a plate which, having\r\nbeen slightly heated, did not act, was rendered active by a more powerful\r\nignition.\r\n\r\n598. Though thus uncertain in its action, and though often diminishing the\r\npower given to the plates at the positive pole of the pile (584.), still it\r\nis evident that heat can render platina active, which before was inert\r\n(595.). The cause of its occasional failure appears to be due to the\r\nsurface of the metal becoming soiled, either from something previously\r\nadhering to it, which is made to adhere more closely by the action of the\r\nheat, or from matter communicated from the flame of the lamp, or from the\r\nair itself. It often happens that a polished plate of platina, when heated\r\nby the spirit-lamp and a blowpipe, becomes dulled and clouded on its\r\nsurface by something either formed or deposited there; and this, and much\r\nless than this, is sufficient to prevent it from exhibiting the curious\r\npower now under consideration (634. 636.). Platina also has been said to\r\ncombine with carbon; and it is not at all unlikely that in processes of\r\nheating, where carbon or its compounds are present, a film of such a\r\ncompound may be thus formed, and thus prevent the exhibition of the\r\nproperties belonging to _pure_ platina[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] When heat does confer the property it is only by the destruction\r\n  or dissipation of organic or other matter which had previously soiled\r\n  the plate (632. 633. 634.).--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n599. The action of alkalies and acids in giving platina this property was\r\nnow experimentally examined. Platina plates (569.) having no action on\r\nmixed oxygen and hydrogen, being boiled in a solution of caustic potassa,\r\nwashed, and then put into the gases, were found occasionally to act pretty\r\nwell, but at other times to fail. In the latter case I concluded that the\r\nimpurity upon the surface of the platina was of a nature not to be removed\r\nby the mere solvent action of the alkali, for when the plates were rubbed\r\nwith a little emery, and the same solution of alkali (592.), they became\r\nactive.\r\n\r\n600. The action of acids was far more constant and satisfactory. A platina\r\nplate was boiled in dilute nitric acid: being washed and put into mixed\r\noxygen and hydrogen gases, it acted well. Other plates were boiled in\r\nstrong nitric acid for periods extending from half a minute to four\r\nminutes, and then being washed in distilled water, were found to act very\r\nwell, condensing one cubic inch and a half of gas in the space of eight or\r\nnine minutes, and rendering the tube warm (570.).\r\n\r\n601. Strong sulphuric acid was very effectual in rendering the platina\r\nactive. A plate (569.) was heated in it for a minute, then washed and put\r\ninto the mixed oxygen and hydrogen, upon which it acted as well as if it\r\nhad been made the positive pole of a voltaic pile (570.).\r\n\r\n602. Plates which, after being heated or electrized in alkali, or after\r\nother treatment, were found inert, immediately received power by being\r\ndipped for a minute or two, or even only for an instant, into hot oil of\r\nvitriol, and then into water.\r\n\r\n603. When the plate was dipped into the oil of vitriol, taken out, and then\r\nheated so as to drive off the acid, it did not act, in consequence of the\r\nimpurity left by the acid upon its surface.\r\n\r\n604. Vegetable acids, as acetic and tartaric, sometimes rendered inert\r\nplatina active, at other times not. This, I believe, depended upon the\r\ncharacter of the matter previously soiling the plates, and which may easily\r\nbe supposed to be sometimes of such a nature as to be removed by these\r\nacids, and at other times not. Weak sulphuric acid showed the same\r\ndifference, but strong sulphuric acid (601.) never failed in its action.\r\n\r\n605. The most favourable treatment, except that of making the plate a\r\npositive pole in strong acid, was as follows. The plate was held over a\r\nspirit-lamp flame, and when hot, rubbed with a piece of potassa fusa\r\n(caustic potash), which melting, covered the metal with a coat of very\r\nstrong alkali, and this was retained fused upon the surface for a second or\r\ntwo[A]: it was then put into water for four or five minutes to wash off the\r\nalkali, shaken, and immersed for about a minute in hot strong oil of\r\nvitriol; from this it was removed into distilled water, where it was\r\nallowed to remain ten or fifteen minutes to remove the last traces of acid\r\n(582.). Being then put into a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, combination\r\nimmediately began, and proceeded rapidly; the tube became warm, the platina\r\nbecame red-hot, and the residue of the gases was inflamed. This effect\r\ncould be repeated at pleasure, and thus the maximum phenomenon could be\r\nproduced without the aid of the voltaic battery.\r\n\r\n  [A] The heat need not be raised so much as to make the alkali tarnish\r\n  the platina, although if that effect does take place it does not\r\n  prevent the ultimate action.\r\n\r\n606. When a solution of tartaric or acetic acid was substituted, in this\r\nmode of preparation, for the sulphuric acid, still the plate was found to\r\nacquire the same power, and would often produce explosion in the mixed\r\ngases; but the strong sulphuric acid was most certain and powerful.\r\n\r\n607. If borax, or a mixture of the carbonates of potash and soda, be fused\r\non the surface of a platina plate, and that plate be well-washed in water,\r\nit will be found to have acquired the power of combining oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, but only in a moderate degree; but if, after the fusion and\r\nwashing, it be dipped in the hot sulphuric acid (601.), it will become very\r\nactive.\r\n\r\n608. Other metals than platina were then experimented with. Gold and\r\npalladium exhibited the power either when made the positive pole of the\r\nvoltaic battery (570.), or when acted on by hot oil of vitriol (601.). When\r\npalladium is used, the action of the battery or acid should be moderated,\r\nas that metal is soon acted upon under such circumstances. Silver and\r\ncopper could not be made to show any effect at common temperatures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n609. There can remain no doubt that the property of inducing combination,\r\nwhich can thus be conferred upon masses of platina and other metals by\r\nconnecting them with the poles of the battery, or by cleansing processes\r\neither of a mechanical or chemical nature, is the same as that which was\r\ndiscovered by Döbereiner[A], in 1823, to belong in so eminent a degree to\r\nspongy platina, and which was afterwards so well experimented upon and\r\nillustrated by MM. Dulong and Thenard[B], in 1823. The latter philosophers\r\neven quote experiments in which a very fine platina wire, which had been\r\ncoiled up and digested in nitric, sulphuric, or muriatic acid, became\r\nignited when put into a jet of hydrogen gas[C]. This effect I can now\r\nproduce at pleasure with either wires or plates by the processes described\r\n(570. 601. 605.); and by using a smaller plate cut so that it shall rest\r\nagainst the glass by a few points, and yet allow the water to flow off\r\n(fig. 59.), the loss of heat is less, the metal is assimilated somewhat to\r\nthe spongy state, and the probability of failure almost entirely removed.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, tom. xxiv. p. 93.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. tom. xxiii. p. 440; tom. xxiv. p. 380.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. tom. xxiv. p. 383.\r\n\r\n610. M. Döbereiner refers the effect entirely to an electric action. He\r\nconsiders the platina and hydrogen as forming a voltaic element of the\r\nordinary kind, in which the hydrogen, being very highly positive,\r\nrepresents the zinc of the usual arrangement, and like it, therefore,\r\nattracts oxygen and combines with it[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] tom. xxiv. pp. 94, 95. Also Bibliothèque Universelle, tom. xxiv.\r\n  p. 54.\r\n\r\n611. In the two excellent experimental papers by MM. Dulong and Thenard[A],\r\nthose philosophers show that elevation of temperature favours the action,\r\nbut does not alter its character; Sir Humphry Davy's incandescent platina\r\nwire being the same phenomenon with Döbereiner's spongy platina. They show\r\nthat _all_ metals have this power in a greater or smaller degree, and that\r\nit is even possessed by such bodies as charcoal, pumice, porcelain, glass,\r\nrock crystal, &c., when their temperatures are raised; and that another of\r\nDavy's effects, in which oxygen and hydrogen had combined slowly together\r\nat a heat below ignition, was really dependent upon the property of the\r\nheated glass, which it has in common with the bodies named above. They\r\nstate that liquids do not show this effect, at least that mercury, at or\r\nbelow the boiling point, has not the power; that it is not due to porosity;\r\nthat the same body varies very much in its action, according to its state;\r\nand that many other gaseous mixtures besides oxygen and hydrogen are\r\naffected, and made to act chemically, when the temperature is raised. They\r\nthink it probable that spongy platina acquires its power from contact with\r\nthe acid evolved during its reduction, or from the heat itself to which it\r\nis then submitted.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, tom. xxiii. p. 440; tom. xxiv. p, 380.\r\n\r\n612. MM. Dulong and Thenard express themselves with great caution on the\r\ntheory of this action; but, referring to the decomposing power of metals on\r\nammonia when heated to temperatures not sufficient alone to affect the\r\nalkali, they remark that those metals which in this case are most\r\nefficacious, are the least so in causing the combination of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen; whilst platina, gold, &c., which have least power of decomposing\r\nammonia, have most power of combining the elements of water:--from which\r\nthey are led to believe, that amongst gases, some tend to _unite_ under the\r\ninfluence of metals, whilst others tend to _separate_, and that this\r\nproperty varies in opposite directions with the different metals. At the\r\nclose of their second paper they observe, that the action is of a kind that\r\ncannot be connected with any known theory; and though it is very remarkable\r\nthat the effects are transient, like those of most electrical actions, yet\r\nthey state that the greater number of the results observed by them are\r\ninexplicable, by supposing them to be of a purely electric origin.\r\n\r\n613. Dr. Fusinieri has also written on this subject, and given a theory\r\nwhich he considers as sufficient to account for the phenomena[A]. He\r\nexpresses the immediate cause thus: \"The platina determines upon its\r\nsurface a continual renovation of _concrete laminæ_ of the combustible\r\nsubstance of the gases or vapours, which flowing over it are burnt, pass\r\naway, and are renewed: this combustion at the surface raises and sustains\r\nthe temperature of the metal.\" The combustible substance, thus reduced into\r\nimperceptible laminæ, of which the concrete parts are in contact with the\r\noxygen, is presumed to be in a state combinable with the oxygen at a much\r\nlower temperature than when it is in the gaseous state, and more in analogy\r\nwith what is called the nascent condition. That combustible gases should\r\nlose their elastic state, and become concrete, assuming the form of\r\nexceedingly attenuated but solid strata, is considered as proved by facts,\r\nsome of which are quoted in the Giornale di Fisica for 1824[B]; and though\r\nthe theory requires that they should assume this state at high\r\ntemperatures, and though the _similar_ films of aqueous and other matter\r\nare dissipated by the action of heat, still the facts are considered as\r\njustifying the conclusion against all opposition of reasoning.\r\n\r\n  [A] Giornale di Fisica, &c., 1825, tom. viii. p. 259.\r\n\r\n  [B] pp. 138, 371.\r\n\r\n614. The power or force which makes combustible gas or vapour abandon its\r\nelastic state in contact with a solid, that it may cover the latter with a\r\nthin stratum of its own proper substance, is considered as being neither\r\nattraction nor affinity. It is able also to extend liquids and solids in\r\nconcrete laminæ over the surface of the acting solid body, and consists in\r\na _repulsion_, which is developed from the parts of the solid body by the\r\nsimple fact of attenuation, and is highest when the attenuation is most\r\ncomplete. The force has a progressive development, and acts most\r\npowerfully, or at first, in the direction in which the dimensions of the\r\nattenuated mass decrease, and then in the direction of the angles or\r\ncorners which from any cause may exist on the surface. This force not only\r\ncauses spontaneous diffusion of gases and other substances over the\r\nsurface, but is considered as very elementary in its nature, and competent\r\nto account for all the phenomena of capillarity, chemical affinity,\r\nattraction of aggregation, rarefaction, ebullition, volatilization,\r\nexplosion, and other thermometric effects, as well as inflammation,\r\ndetonation, &c. &c. It is considered as a form of heat to which the term\r\n_native calorie_ is given, and is still further viewed as the principle of\r\nthe two electricities and the two magnetisms.\r\n\r\n615. I have been the more anxious to give a correct abstract of Dr.\r\nFusinieri's view, both because I cannot form a distinct idea of the power\r\nto which he refers the phenomena, and because of my imperfect knowledge of\r\nthe language in which the memoir is written. I would therefore beg to refer\r\nthose who pursue the subject to the memoir itself.\r\n\r\n616. Not feeling, however, that the problem has yet been solved, I venture\r\nto give the view which seems to me sufficient, upon _known principles_, to\r\naccount for the effect.\r\n\r\n617. It may be observed of this action, that, with regard to platina, it\r\ncannot be due to any peculiar, temporary condition, either of an electric\r\nor of any other nature: the activity of plates rendered either positive or\r\nnegative by the pole, or cleaned with such different substances as acids,\r\nalkalies, or water; charcoal, emery, ashes, or glass; or merely heated, is\r\nsufficient to negative such an opinion. Neither does it depend upon the\r\nspongy and porous, or upon the compact and burnished, or upon the massive\r\nor the attenuated state of the metal, for in any of these states it may be\r\nrendered effective, or its action may be taken away. The only essential\r\ncondition appears to be a _perfectly clean_ and _metallic surface_, for\r\nwhenever that is present the platina acts, whatever its form and condition\r\nin other respects may be; and though variations in the latter points will\r\nvery much affect the rapidity, and therefore the visible appearances and\r\nsecondary effects, of the action, i.e. the ignition of the metal and the\r\ninflammation of the gases, they, even in their most favourable state,\r\ncannot produce any effect unless the condition of a clean, pure, metallic\r\nsurface be also fulfilled.\r\n\r\n618. The effect is evidently produced by most, if not all, solid bodies,\r\nweakly perhaps by many of them, but rising to a high degree in platina.\r\nDulong and Thenard have very philosophically extended our knowledge of the\r\nproperty to its possession by all the metals, and by earths, glass, stones,\r\n&c. (611.); and every idea of its being a known and recognised electric\r\naction is in this way removed.\r\n\r\n619. All the phenomena connected with this subject press upon my mind the\r\nconviction that the effects in question are entirely incidental and of a\r\nsecondary nature; that they are dependent upon the _natural conditions_ of\r\ngaseous elasticity, combined with the exertion of that attractive force\r\npossessed by many bodies, especially those which are solid, in an eminent\r\ndegree, and probably belonging to all; by which they are drawn into\r\nassociation more or less close, without at the same time undergoing\r\nchemical combination, though often assuming the condition of adhesion; and\r\nwhich occasionally leads, under very favourable circumstances, as in the\r\npresent instance, to the combination of bodies simultaneously subjected to\r\nthis attraction. I am prepared myself to admit (and probably many others\r\nare of the same opinion), both with respect to the attraction of\r\naggregation and of chemical affinity, that the sphere of action of\r\nparticles extends beyond those other particles with which they are\r\nimmediately and evidently in union (523.), and in many cases produces\r\neffects rising into considerable importance: and I think that this kind of\r\nattraction is a determining cause of Döbereiner's effect, and of the many\r\nothers of a similar nature.\r\n\r\n620. Bodies which become wetted by fluids with which they do not combine\r\nchemically, or in which they do not dissolve, are simple and well-known\r\ninstances of this kind of attraction.\r\n\r\n621. All those cases of bodies which being insoluble in water and not\r\ncombining with it are hygrometric, and condense its vapour around or upon\r\ntheir surface, are stronger instances of the same power, and approach a\r\nlittle nearer to the cases under investigation. If pulverized clay,\r\nprotoxide or peroxide of iron, oxide of manganese, charcoal, or even\r\nmetals, as spongy platina or precipitated silver, be put into an atmosphere\r\ncontaining vapour of water, they soon become moist by virtue of an\r\nattraction which is able to condense the vapour upon, although not to\r\ncombine it with, the substances; and if, as is well known, these bodies so\r\ndamped be put into a dry atmosphere, as, for instance, one confined over\r\nsulphuric acid, or if they be heated, then they yield up this water again\r\nalmost entirely, it not being in direct or permanent combination[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] I met at Edinburgh with a case, remarkable as to its extent, of\r\n  hygrometric action, assisted a little perhaps by very slight solvent\r\n  power. Some turf had been well-dried by long exposure in a covered\r\n  place to the atmosphere, but being then submitted to the action of a\r\n  hydrostatic press, it yielded, _by the mere influence of the\r\n  pressure_, 54 per cent. of water.\r\n\r\n622. Still better instances of the power I refer to, because they are more\r\nanalogous to the cases to be explained, are furnished by the attraction\r\nexisting between glass and air, so well known to barometer and thermometer\r\nmakers, for here the adhesion or attraction is exerted between a solid and\r\ngases, bodies having very different physical conditions, having no power of\r\ncombination with each other, and each retaining, during the time of action,\r\nits physical state unchanged[A]. When mercury is poured into a barometer\r\ntube, a film of air will remain between the metal and glass for months, or,\r\nas far as is known, for years, for it has never been displaced except by\r\nthe action of means especially fitted for the purpose. These consist in\r\nboiling the mercury, or in other words, of forming an abundance of vapour,\r\nwhich coming in contact with every part of the glass and every portion of\r\nsurface of the mercury, gradually mingles with, dilutes, and carries off\r\nthe air attracted by, and adhering to, those surfaces, replacing it by\r\nother vapour, subject to an equal or perhaps greater attraction, but which\r\nwhen cooled condenses into the same liquid as that with which the tube is\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n  [A] Fusinieri and Bellani consider the air as forming solid concrete\r\n  films in these cases.--Giornale di Fisica, tom. viii, p. 262. 1825.\r\n\r\n623. Extraneous bodies, which, acting as nuclei in crystallizing or\r\ndepositing solutions, cause deposition of substances on them, when it does\r\nnot occur elsewhere in the liquid, seem to produce their effects by a power\r\nof the same kind, i.e. a power of attraction extending to neighbouring\r\nparticles, and causing them to become attached to the nuclei, although it\r\nis not strong enough to make them combine chemically with their substance.\r\n\r\n624. It would appear from many cases of nuclei in solutions, and from the\r\neffects of bodies put into atmospheres containing the vapours of water, or\r\ncamphor, or iodine, &c., as if this attraction were in part elective,\r\npartaking in its characters both of the attraction of aggregation and\r\nchemical affinity: nor is this inconsistent with, but agreeable to, the\r\nidea entertained, that it is the power of particles acting, not upon others\r\nwith which they can immediately and intimately combine, but upon such as\r\nare either more distantly situated with respect to them, or which, from\r\nprevious condition, physical constitution, or feeble relation, are unable\r\nto enter into decided union with them.\r\n\r\n625. Then, of all bodies, the gases are those which might be expected to\r\nshow some _mutual_ action whilst _jointly_ under the attractive influence\r\nof the platina or other solid acting substance. Liquids, such as water,\r\nalcohol, &c., are in so dense and comparatively incompressible a state, as\r\nto favour no expectation that their particles should approach much closer\r\nto each other by the attraction of the body to which they adhere, and yet\r\nthat attraction must (according to its effects) place their particles as\r\nnear to those of the solid wetted body as they are to each other, and in\r\nmany cases it is evident that the former attraction is the stronger. But\r\ngases and vapours are bodies competent to suffer very great changes in the\r\nrelative distances of their particles by external agencies; and where they\r\nare in immediate contact with the platina, the approximation of the\r\nparticles to those of the metal may be very great. In the case of the\r\nhygrometric bodies referred to (621.), it is sufficient to reduce the\r\nvapour to the fluid state, frequently from atmospheres so rare that without\r\nthis influence it would be needful to compress them by mechanical force\r\ninto a bulk not more than 1/10th or even 1/20th of their original volume\r\nbefore the vapours would become liquids.\r\n\r\n626. Another most important consideration in relation to this action of\r\nbodies, and which, as far as I am aware, has not hitherto been noticed, is\r\nthe condition of elasticity under which the gases are placed against the\r\nacting surface. We have but very imperfect notions of the real and intimate\r\nconditions of the particles of a body existing in the solid, the liquid,\r\nand the gaseous state; but when we speak of the gaseous state as being due\r\nto the mutual repulsions of the particles or of their atmospheres, although\r\nwe may err in imagining each particle to be a little nucleus to an\r\natmosphere of heat, or electricity, or any other agent, we are still not\r\nlikely to be in error in considering the elasticity as dependent on\r\n_mutuality_ of action. Now this mutual relation fails altogether on the\r\nside of the gaseous particles next to the platina, and we might be led to\r\nexpect _à priori_ a deficiency of elastic force there to at least one half;\r\nfor if, as Dalton has shown, the elastic force of the particles of one gas\r\ncannot act against the elastic force of the particles of another, the two\r\nbeing as vacua to each other, so is it far less likely that the particles\r\nof the platina can exert any influence on those of the gas against it, such\r\nas would be exerted by gaseous particles of its own kind.\r\n\r\n627. But the diminution of power to one-half on the side of the gaseous\r\nbody towards the metal is only a slight result of what seems to me to flow\r\nas a necessary consequence of the known constitution of gases. An\r\natmosphere of one gas or vapour, however dense or compressed, is in effect\r\nas a vacuum to another: thus, if a little water were put into a vessel\r\ncontaining a dry gas, as air, of the pressure of one hundred atmospheres,\r\nas much vapour of the water would _rise_ as if it were in a perfect vacuum.\r\nHere the particles of watery vapour appear to have no difficulty in\r\napproaching within any distance of the particles of air, being influenced\r\nsolely by relation to particles of their own kind; and if it be so with\r\nrespect to a body having the same elastic powers as itself, how much more\r\nsurely must it be so with particles, like those of the platina, or other\r\nlimiting body, which at the same time that they have not these elastic\r\npowers, are also unlike it in nature! Hence it would seem to result that\r\nthe particles of hydrogen or any other gas or vapour which are next to the\r\nplatina, &c., must be in such contact with it as if they were in the liquid\r\nstate, and therefore almost infinitely closer to it than they are to each\r\nother, even though the metal be supposed to exert no attractive influence\r\nover them.\r\n\r\n628. A third and very important consideration in favour of the mutual\r\naction of gases under these circumstances is their perfect miscibility. If\r\nfluid bodies capable of combining together are also capable of mixture,\r\n_they do combine_ when they are mingled, not waiting for any other\r\ndetermining circumstance; but if two such gases as oxygen and hydrogen are\r\nput together, though they are elements having such powerful affinity as to\r\nunite naturally under a thousand different circumstances, they do not\r\ncombine by mere mixture. Still it is evident that, from their perfect\r\nassociation, the particles are in the most favourable state possible for\r\ncombination upon the supervention of any determining cause, such either as\r\nthe negative action of the platina in suppressing or annihilating, as it\r\nwere, their elasticity on its side; or the positive action of the metal in\r\ncondensing them against its surface by an attractive force; or the\r\ninfluence of both together.\r\n\r\n629. Although there are not many distinct cases of combination under the\r\ninfluence of forces external to the combining particles, yet there are\r\nsufficient to remove any difficulty which might arise on that ground. Sir\r\nJames Hull found carbonic acid and lime to remain combined under pressure\r\nat temperatures at which they would not have remained combined if the\r\npressure had been removed; and I have had occasion to observe a case of\r\ndirect combination in chlorine[A], which being compressed at common\r\ntemperatures will combine with water, and form a definite crystalline\r\nhydrate, incapable either of being formed or of existing if that pressure\r\nbe removed.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1823, p. 161.\r\n\r\n630. The course of events when platina acts upon, and combines oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, may be stated, according to these principles, as follows. From\r\nthe influence of the circumstances mentioned (619. &c.), i.e. the\r\ndeficiency of elastic power and the attraction of the metal for the gases,\r\nthe latter, when they are in association with the former, are so far\r\ncondensed as to be brought within the action of their mutual affinities at\r\nthe existing temperature; the deficiency of elastic power, not merely\r\nsubjecting them more closely to the attractive influence of the metal, but\r\nalso bringing them into a more favourable state for union, by abstracting a\r\npart of that power (upon which depends their elasticity,) which elsewhere\r\nin the mass of gases is opposing their combination. The consequence of\r\ntheir combination is the production of the vapour of water and an elevation\r\nof temperature. But as the attraction of the platina for the water formed\r\nis not greater than for the gases, if so great, (for the metal is scarcely\r\nhygrometric,) the vapour is quickly diffused through the remaining gases;\r\nfresh portions of this latter, therefore, come into juxtaposition with the\r\nmetal, combine, and the fresh vapour formed is also diffused, allowing new\r\nportions of gas to be acted upon. In this way the process advances, but is\r\naccelerated by the evolution of heat, which is known by experiment to\r\nfacilitate the combination in proportion to its intensity, and the\r\ntemperature is thus gradually exalted until ignition results.\r\n\r\n631. The dissipation of the vapour produced at the surface of the platina,\r\nand the contact of fresh oxygen and hydrogen with the metal, form no\r\ndifficulty in this explication. The platina is not considered as causing\r\nthe combination of any particles with itself, but only associating them\r\nclosely around it; and the compressed particles are as free to move from\r\nthe platina, being replaced by other particles, as a portion of dense air\r\nupon the surface of the globe, or at the bottom of a deep mine, is free to\r\nmove by the slightest impulse, into the upper and rarer parts of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n632. It can hardly be necessary to give any reasons why platina does not\r\nshow this effect under ordinary circumstances. It is then not sufficiently\r\nclean (617.), and the gases are prevented from touching it, and suffering\r\nthat degree of effect which is needful to commence their combination at\r\ncommon temperatures, and which they can only experience at its surface. In\r\nfact, the very power which causes the combination of oxygen and hydrogen,\r\nis competent, under the usual casual exposure of platina, to condense\r\nextraneous matters upon its surface, which soiling it, take away for the\r\ntime its power of combining oxygen and hydrogen, by preventing their\r\ncontact with it (598.).\r\n\r\n633. Clean platina, by which I mean such as has been made the positive pole\r\nof a pile (570.), or has been treated with acid (605.), and has then been\r\nput into distilled water for twelve or fifteen minutes, has a _peculiar\r\nfriction_ when one piece is rubbed against another. It wets freely with\r\npure water, even after it has been shaken and dried by the heat of a\r\nspirit-lamp; and if made the pole of a voltaic pile in a dilute acid, it\r\nevolves minute bubbles from every part of its surface. But platina in its\r\ncommon state wants that peculiar friction: it will not wet freely with\r\nwater as the clean platina does; and when made the positive pole of a pile,\r\nit for a time gives off large bubbles, which seem to cling or adhere to the\r\nmetal, and are evolved at distinct and separate points of the surface.\r\nThese appearances and effects, as well as its want of power on oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, are the consequences, and the indications, of a soiled surface.\r\n\r\n634. I found also that platina plates which had been cleaned perfectly soon\r\nbecame soiled by mere exposure to the air; for after twenty-four hours they\r\nno longer moistened freely with water, but the fluid ran up into portions,\r\nleaving part of the surface bare, whilst other plates which had been\r\nretained in water for the same time, when they were dried (580.) did\r\nmoisten, and gave the other indications of a clean surface.\r\n\r\n635. Nor was this the case with platina or metals only, but also with\r\nearthy bodies, Rock crystal and obsidian would not wet freely upon the\r\nsurface, but being moistened with strong oil of vitriol, then washed, and\r\nleft in distilled water to remove all the acid, they did freely become\r\nmoistened, whether they were previously dry or whether they were left wet;\r\nbut being dried and left exposed to the air for twenty-four hours, their\r\nsurface became so soiled that water would not then adhere freely to it, but\r\nran up into partial portions. Wiping with a cloth (even the cleanest) was\r\nstill worse than exposure to air; the surface either of the minerals or\r\nmetals immediately became as if it were slightly greasy. The floating upon\r\nwater of small particles of metals under ordinary circumstances is a\r\nconsequence of this kind of soiled surface. The extreme difficulty of\r\ncleaning the surface of mercury when it has once been soiled or greased, is\r\ndue to the same cause.\r\n\r\n636. The same reasons explain why the power of the platina plates in some\r\ncircumstances soon disappear, and especially upon use: MM. Dulong and\r\nThenard have observed the same effect with the spongy metal[A], as indeed\r\nhave all those who have used Döbereiner's instantaneous light machines. If\r\nleft in the air, if put into ordinary distilled water, if made to act upon\r\nordinary oxygen and hydrogen, they can still find in all these cases _that_\r\nminute portion of impurity which, when once in contact with the surface of\r\nthe platina, is retained there, and is sufficient to prevent its full\r\naction upon oxygen and hydrogen at common temperatures: a slight elevation\r\nof temperature is again sufficient to compensate this effect, and cause\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, tom. xxiv. p. 386.\r\n\r\n637. No state of a solid body can be conceived more favourable for the\r\nproduction of the effect than that which is possessed by platina obtained\r\nfrom the ammonio-muriate by heat. Its surface is most extensive and pure,\r\nyet very accessible to the gases brought in contact with it: if placed in\r\nimpurity, the interior, as Thenard and Dulong have observed, is preserved\r\nclean by the exterior; and as regards temperature, it is so bad a conductor\r\nof heat, because of its divided condition, that almost all which is evolved\r\nby the combination of the first portions of gas is retained within the\r\nmass, exalting the tendency of the succeeding portions to combine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n638. I have now to notice some very extraordinary interferences with this\r\nphenomenon, dependent, not upon the nature or condition of the metal or\r\nother acting solid, but upon the presence of certain substances mingled\r\nwith the gases acted upon; and as I shall have occasion to speak frequently\r\nof a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, I wish it always to be understood that\r\nI mean a mixture composed of one volume of oxygen to two volumes of\r\nhydrogen, being the proportions that form water. Unless otherwise\r\nexpressed, the hydrogen was always that obtained by the action of dilute\r\nsulphuric acid on pure zinc, and the oxygen that obtained by the action of\r\nheat from the chlorate of potassa.\r\n\r\n639. Mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen with _air_, containing one-fourth,\r\none-half, and even two-thirds of the latter, being introduced with prepared\r\nplatina plates (570. 605.) into tubes, were acted upon almost as well as if\r\nno air were present: the retardation was far less than might have been\r\nexpected from the mere dilution and consequent obstruction to the contact\r\nof the gases with the plates. In two hours and a half nearly all the oxygen\r\nand hydrogen introduced as mixture was gone.\r\n\r\n640. But when similar experiments were made with _olefiant gas_ (the\r\nplatina plates having been made the positive poles of a voltaic pile (570.)\r\nin acid), very different results occurred. A mixture was made of 29.2\r\nvolumes hydrogen and 14.6 volumes oxygen, being the proportions for water;\r\nand to this was added another mixture of 3 volumes oxygen and one volume\r\nolefiant gas, so that the olefiant gas formed but 1/40th part of the whole;\r\nyet in this mixture the platina plate would not act in forty-five hours.\r\nThe failure was not for want of any power in the plate, for when after that\r\ntime it was taken out of this mixture and put into one of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, it immediately acted, and in seven minutes caused explosion of\r\nthe gas. This result was obtained several times, and when larger\r\nproportions of olefiant gas were used, the action seemed still more\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\n641. A mixture of forty-nine volumes oxygen and hydrogen (638.) with one\r\nvolume of olefiant gas had a well-prepared platina plate introduced. The\r\ndiminution of gas was scarcely sensible at the end of two hours, during\r\nwhich it was watched; but on examination twenty-four hours afterwards, the\r\ntube was found blown to pieces. The action, therefore, though it had been\r\nvery much retarded, had occurred at last, and risen to a maximum.\r\n\r\n642. With a mixture of ninety-nine volumes of oxygen and hydrogen (638.)\r\nwith one of olefiant gas, a feeble action was evident at the end of fifty\r\nminutes; it went on accelerating (630.) until the eighty-fifth minute, and\r\nthen became so intense that the gas exploded. Here also the retarding\r\neffect of the olefiant gas was very beautifully illustrated.\r\n\r\n643. Plates prepared by alkali and acid (605.) produced effects\r\ncorresponding to those just described.\r\n\r\n644. It is perfectly clear from these experiments, that _olefiant gas_,\r\neven in small quantities, has a very remarkable influence in preventing the\r\ncombination of oxygen and hydrogen under these circumstances, and yet\r\nwithout at all injuring or affecting the power of the platina.\r\n\r\n645. Another striking illustration of similar interference may be shown in\r\n_carbonic oxide_; especially if contrasted with _carbonic acid_. A mixture\r\nof one volume oxygen and hydrogen (638.) with four volumes of carbonic acid\r\nwas affected at once by a platina plate prepared with acid, &c. (605.); and\r\nin one hour and a quarter nearly all the oxygen and hydrogen was gone.\r\nMixtures containing less carbonic acid were still more readily affected.\r\n\r\n646. But when carbonic oxide was substituted for the carbonic acid, not the\r\nslightest effect of combination was produced; and when the carbonic oxide\r\nwas only one-eighth of the whole volume, no action occurred in forty and\r\nfifty hours. Yet the plates had not lost their power; for being taken out\r\nand put into pure oxygen and hydrogen, they acted well and at once.\r\n\r\n647. Two volumes of carbonic oxide and one of oxygen were mingled with nine\r\nvolumes of oxygen and hydrogen (638.). This mixture was not affected by a\r\nplate which had been made positive in acid, though it remained in it\r\nfifteen hours. But when to the same volumes of carbonic oxide and oxygen\r\nwere added thirty-three volumes of oxygen and hydrogen, the carbonic oxide\r\nbeing then only 1/18th part of the whole, the plate acted, slowly at first,\r\nand at the end of forty-two minutes the gases exploded.\r\n\r\n648. These experiments were extended to various gases and vapours, the\r\ngeneral results of which may be given as follow. Oxygen, hydrogen,\r\nnitrogen, and nitrous oxide, when used to dilute the mixture of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, did not prevent the action of the plates even when they made\r\nfour-fifths of the whole volume of gas acted upon. Nor was the retardation\r\nso great in any case as might have been expected from the mere dilution of\r\nthe oxygen and hydrogen, and the consequent mechanical obstruction to its\r\ncontact with the platina. The order in which carbonic acid and these\r\nsubstances seemed to stand was as follows, the first interfering least with\r\nthe action; _nitrous oxide, hydrogen, carbonic acid, nitrogen, oxygen_: but\r\nit is possible the plates were not equally well prepared in all the cases,\r\nand that other circumstances also were unequal; consequently more numerous\r\nexperiments would be required to establish the order accurately.\r\n\r\n649. As to cases of _retardation_, the powers of olefiant gas and carbonic\r\noxide have been already described. Mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen,\r\ncontaining from 1/16th to 1/20th of sulphuretted hydrogen or phosphuretted\r\nhydrogen, seemed to show a little action at first, but were not further\r\naffected by the prepared plates, though in contact with them for seventy\r\nhours. When the plates were removed they had lost all power over pure\r\noxygen and hydrogen, and the interference of these gases was therefore of a\r\ndifferent nature from that of the two former, having permanently affected\r\nthe plate.\r\n\r\n650. A small piece of cork was dipped in sulphuret of carbon and passed up\r\nthrough water into a tube containing oxygen and hydrogen (638.), so as to\r\ndiffuse a portion of its vapour through the gases. A plate being introduced\r\nappeared at first to act a little, but after sixty-one hours the diminution\r\nwas very small. Upon putting the same plate into a pure mixture of oxygen\r\nand hydrogen, it acted at once and powerfully, having apparently suffered\r\nno diminution of its force.\r\n\r\n651. A little vapour of ether being mixed with the oxygen and hydrogen\r\nretarded the action of the plate, but did not prevent it altogether. A\r\nlittle of the vapour of the condensed oil-gas liquor[A] retarded the action\r\nstill more, but not nearly so much as an equal volume of olefiant gas would\r\nhave done. In both these cases it was the original oxygen and hydrogen\r\nwhich combined together, the ether and the oil-gas vapour remaining\r\nunaffected, and in both cases the plates retained the power of acting on\r\nfresh oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1825, p.440.\r\n\r\n652. Spongy platina was then used in place of the plates, and jets of\r\nhydrogen mingled with the different gases thrown against it in air. The\r\nresults were exactly of the same kind, although presented occasionally in a\r\nmore imposing form. Thus, mixtures of one volume of olefiant gas or\r\ncarbonic oxide with three of hydrogen could not heat the spongy platina\r\nwhen the experiments were commenced at common temperatures; but a mixture\r\nof equal volumes of nitrogen and hydrogen acted very well, causing\r\nignition. With carbonic acid the results were still more striking. A\r\nmixture of three volumes of that gas with one of hydrogen caused _ignition_\r\nof the platina, yet that mixture would not continue to burn from the jet\r\nwhen attempts were made to light it by a taper. A mixture even of _seven_\r\nvolumes of carbonic acid and _one_ of hydrogen will thus cause the ignition\r\nof cold spongy platina, and yet, as if to supply a contrast, than which\r\nnone can be greater, _it cannot burn at a taper_, but causes the extinction\r\nof the latter. On the other hand, the mixtures of carbonic oxide or\r\nolefiant gas, which can do nothing with the platina, are _inflamed_ by the\r\ntaper, burning well.\r\n\r\n653. Hydrogen mingled with the vapour of ether or oil-gas liquor causes the\r\nignition of the spongy platina. The mixture with oil-gas burns with a flame\r\nfar brighter than that of the mixture of hydrogen and olefiant gas already\r\nreferred to, so that it would appear that the retarding action of the\r\nhydrocarbons is not at all in proportion merely to the quantity of carbon\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n654. In connexion with these interferences, I must state, that hydrogen\r\nitself, prepared from steam passed over ignited iron, was found when\r\nmingled with oxygen to resist the action of platina. It had stood over\r\nwater seven days, and had lost all fetid smell; but a jet of it would not\r\ncause the ignition of spongy platina, commencing at common temperatures;\r\nnor would it combine with oxygen in a tube either under the influence of a\r\nprepared plate or of spongy platina. A mixture of one volume of this gas\r\nwith three of pure hydrogen, and the due proportion of oxygen, was not\r\naffected by plates after fifty hours. I am inclined to refer the effect to\r\ncarbonic oxide present in the gas, but have not had time to verify the\r\nsuspicion. The power of the plates was not destroyed (640. 646.).\r\n\r\n655. Such are the general facts of these remarkable interferences. Whether\r\nthe effect produced by such small quantities of certain gases depends upon\r\nany direct action which they may exert upon the particles of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, by which the latter are rendered less inclined to combine, or\r\nwhether it depends upon their modifying the action of the plate temporarily\r\n(for they produce no real change on it), by investing it through the agency\r\nof a stronger attraction than that of the hydrogen, or otherwise, remains\r\nto be decided by more extended experiments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n656. The theory of action which I have given for the original phenomena\r\nappears to me quite sufficient to account for all the effects by reference\r\nto known properties, and dispenses with the assumption of any new power of\r\nmatter. I have pursued this subject at some length, as one of great\r\nconsequence, because I am convinced that the superficial actions of matter,\r\nwhether between two bodies, or of one piece of the same body, and the\r\nactions of particles not directly or strongly in combination, are becoming\r\ndaily more and more important to our theories of chemical as well as\r\nmechanical philosophy[A]. In all ordinary cases of combustion it is evident\r\nthat an action of the kind considered, occurring upon the surface of the\r\ncarbon in the fire, and also in the bright part of a flame, must have great\r\ninfluence over the combinations there taking place.\r\n\r\n  [A] As a curious illustration of the influence of mechanical forces\r\n  over chemical affinity, I will quote the refusal of certain substances\r\n  to effloresce when their surfaces are perfect, which yield immediately\r\n  upon the surface being broken, If crystals of carbonate of soda, or\r\n  phosphate of soda, or sulphate of soda, having no part of their\r\n  surfaces broken, be preserved from external violence, they will not\r\n  effloresce. I have thus retained crystals of carbonate of soda\r\n  perfectly transparent and unchanged from September 1827 to January\r\n  1833; and crystals of sulphate of soda from May 1832 to the present\r\n  time, November 1833. If any part of the surface were scratched or\r\n  broken, then efflorescence began at that part, and covered the whole.\r\n  The crystals were merely placed in evaporating basins and covered with\r\n  paper.\r\n\r\n657. The condition of elasticity upon the exterior of the gaseous or\r\nvaporous mass already referred to (626. 627.), must be connected directly\r\nwith the action of solid bodies, as nuclei, on vapours, causing\r\ncondensation upon them in preference to any condensation in the vapours\r\nthemselves; and in the well-known effect of nuclei on solutions a similar\r\ncondition may have existence (623.), for an analogy in condition exists\r\nbetween the parts of a body in solution, and those of a body in the\r\nvaporous or gaseous state. This thought leads us to the consideration of\r\nwhat are the respective conditions at the surfaces of contact of two\r\nportions of the same substance at the same temperature, one in the solid or\r\nliquid, and the other in the vaporous state; as, for instance, steam and\r\nwater. It would seem that the particles of vapour next to the particles of\r\nliquid are in a different relation to the latter to what they would be with\r\nrespect to any other liquid or solid substance; as, for instance, mercury\r\nor platina, if they were made to replace the water, i.e. if the view of\r\nindependent action which I have taken (626. 627.) as a consequence of\r\nDalton's principles, be correct. It would also seem that the mutual\r\nrelation of similar particles, and the indifference of dissimilar particles\r\nwhich Dalton has established as a matter of fact amongst gases and vapours,\r\nextends to a certain degree amongst solids and fluids, that is, when they\r\nare in relation by contact with vapours, either of their own substance or\r\nof other bodies. But though I view these points as of great importance with\r\nrespect to the relations existing between different substances and their\r\nphysical constitution in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, I have not\r\nsufficiently considered them to venture any strong opinions or statements\r\nhere[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In reference to this paragraph and also 626, see a correction by\r\n  Dr. C. Henry, in his valuable paper on this curious subject.\r\n  Philosophical Magazine, 1835. vol. vi. p. 305.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n658. There are numerous well-known cases, in which substances, such as\r\noxygen and hydrogen, act readily in their _nascent_ state, and produce\r\nchemical changes which they are not able to effect if once they have\r\nassumed the gaseous condition. Such instances are very common at the poles\r\nof the voltaic pile, and are, I think, easily accounted for, if it be\r\nconsidered that at the moment of separation of any such particle it is\r\nentirely surrounded by other particles of a _different_ kind with which it\r\nis in close contact, and has not yet assumed those relations and conditions\r\nwhich it has in its fully developed state, and which it can only assume by\r\nassociation with other particles of its own kind. For, at the moment, its\r\nelasticity is absent, and it is in the same relation to particles with\r\nwhich it is in contact, and for which it has an affinity, as the particles\r\nof oxygen and hydrogen are to each other on the surface of clean platina\r\n(626. 627.).\r\n\r\n659. The singular effects of retardation produced by very small quantities\r\nof some gases, and not by large quantities of others (640. 645. 652.), if\r\ndependent upon any relation of the added gas to the surface of the solid,\r\nwill then probably be found immediately connected with the curious\r\nphenomena which are presented by different gases when passing through\r\nnarrow tubes at low pressures, which I observed many years ago[A]; and this\r\naction of surfaces must, I think, influence the highly interesting\r\nphenomena of the diffusion of gases, at least in the form in which it has\r\nbeen experimented upon by Mr. Graham in 1829 and 1831[B], and also by Dr.\r\nMitchell of Philadelphia[C] in 1830. It seems very probable that if such a\r\nsubstance as spongy platina were used, another law for the diffusion of\r\ngases under the circumstances would come out than that obtained by the use\r\nof plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\n  [A] Quarterly Journal of Science, 1819, vol. vii. p. 106.\r\n\r\n  [B] Quarterly Journal of Science, vol. xxviii. p. 74, and Edinburgh\r\n  Transactions, 1831.\r\n\r\n  [C] Journal of the Royal Institution for 1831, p. 101.\r\n\r\n660. I intended to have followed this section by one on the secondary piles\r\nof Ritter, and the peculiar properties of the poles of the pile, or of\r\nmetals through which electricity has passed, which have been observed by\r\nRitter, Van Marum, Yelin, De la Rive, Marianini, Berzelius, and others. It\r\nappears to me that all these phenomena bear a satisfactory explanation on\r\nknown principles, connected with the investigation just terminated, and do\r\nnot require the assumption of any new state or new property. But as the\r\nexperiments advanced, especially those of Marianini, require very careful\r\nrepetition and examination, the necessity of pursuing the subject of\r\nelectro-chemical decomposition obliges me for a time to defer the\r\nresearches to which I have just referred.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nNovember 30, 1833._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. _On Electro-chemical Decomposition, continued._[A] ¶ iv. _On some\r\ngeneral conditions of Electro-decomposition._ ¶ v. _On a new Measurer of\r\nVolta-electricity._ ¶ vi. _On the primary or secondary character of bodies\r\nevolved in Electro-decomposition._ ¶ vii. _On the definite nature and\r\nextent of Electro-chemical Decompositions._ § 13. _On the absolute quantity\r\nof Electricity associated with the particles or atoms of Matter._\r\n\r\n  [A] Refer to the note after 1047, Series VIII.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\nReceived January 9,--Read January 23, February 6 and 13, 1834.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary._\r\n\r\n\r\n661. The theory which I believe to be a true expression of the facts of\r\nelectro-chemical decomposition, and which I have therefore detailed in a\r\nformer series of these Researches, is so much at variance with those\r\npreviously advanced, that I find the greatest difficulty in stating\r\nresults, as I think, correctly, whilst limited to the use of terms which\r\nare current with a certain accepted meaning. Of this kind is the term\r\n_pole_, with its prefixes of positive and negative, and the attached ideas\r\nof attraction and repulsion. The general phraseology is that the positive\r\npole _attracts_ oxygen, acids, &c., or more cautiously, that it\r\n_determines_ their evolution upon its surface; and that the negative pole\r\nacts in an equal manner upon hydrogen, combustibles, metals, and bases.\r\nAccording to my view, the determining force is _not_ at the poles, but\r\n_within_ the body under decomposition; and the oxygen and acids are\r\nrendered at the _negative_ extremity of that body, whilst hydrogen, metals,\r\n&c., are evolved at the _positive_ extremity (518. 524.).\r\n\r\n662. To avoid, therefore, confusion and circumlocution, and for the sake of\r\ngreater precision of expression than I can otherwise obtain, I have\r\ndeliberately considered the subject with two friends, and with their\r\nassistance and concurrence in framing them, I purpose henceforward using\r\ncertain other terms, which I will now define. The _poles_, as they are\r\nusually called, are only the doors or ways by which the electric current\r\npasses into and out of the decomposing body (556.); and they of course,\r\nwhen in contact with that body, are the limits of its extent in the\r\ndirection of the current. The term has been generally applied to the metal\r\nsurfaces in contact with the decomposing substance; but whether\r\nphilosophers generally would also apply it to the surfaces of air (465.\r\n471.) and water (493.), against which I have effected electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition, is subject to doubt. In place of the term pole, I propose\r\nusing that of _Electrode_[A], and I mean thereby that substance, or rather\r\nsurface, whether of air, water, metal, or any other body, which bounds the\r\nextent of the decomposing matter in the direction of the electric current.\r\n\r\n  [A] [Greek: elektron], and [Greek: -odos] _a way_.\r\n\r\n663. The surfaces at which, according to common phraseology, the electric\r\ncurrent enters and leaves a decomposing body, are most important places of\r\naction, and require to be distinguished apart from the poles, with which\r\nthey are mostly, and the electrodes, with which they are always, in\r\ncontact. Wishing for a natural standard of electric direction to which I\r\nmight refer these, expressive of their difference and at the same time free\r\nfrom all theory, I have thought it might be found in the earth. If the\r\nmagnetism of the earth be due to electric currents passing round it, the\r\nlatter must be in a constant direction, which, according to present usage\r\nof speech, would be from east to west, or, which will strengthen this help\r\nto the memory, that in which the sun appears to move. If in any case of\r\nelectro-decomposition we consider the decomposing body as placed so that\r\nthe current passing through it shall be in the same direction, and parallel\r\nto that supposed to exist in the earth, then the surfaces at which the\r\nelectricity is passing into and out of the substance would have an\r\ninvariable reference, and exhibit constantly the same relations of powers.\r\nUpon this notion we purpose calling that towards the east the _anode_[A],\r\nand that towards the west the _cathode_[B]; and whatever changes may take\r\nplace in our views of the nature of electricity and electrical action, as\r\nthey must affect the _natural standard_ referred to, in the same direction,\r\nand to an equal amount with any decomposing substances to which these terms\r\nmay at any time be applied, there seems no reason to expect that they will\r\nlead to confusion, or tend in any way to support false views. The _anode_\r\nis therefore that surface at which the electric current, according to our\r\npresent expression, enters: it is the _negative_ extremity of the\r\ndecomposing body; is where oxygen, chlorine, acids, &c., are evolved; and\r\nis against or opposite the positive electrode. The _cathode_ is that\r\nsurface at which the current leaves the decomposing body, and is its\r\n_positive_ extremity; the combustible bodies, metals, alkalies, and bases,\r\nare evolved there, and it is in contact with the negative electrode.\r\n\r\n  [A] [Greek: ano] _upwards_, and [Greek: -odos] _a way_; the way which\r\nthe sun rises.\r\n\r\n  [B] [Greek: kata] _downwards_, and [Greek: -odos] _a way_; the way\r\n  which the sun sets.\r\n\r\n664. I shall have occasion in these Researches, also, to class bodies\r\ntogether according to certain relations derived from their electrical\r\nactions (822.); and wishing to express those relations without at the same\r\ntime involving the expression of any hypothetical views, I intend using the\r\nfollowing names and terms. Many bodies are decomposed directly by the\r\nelectric current, their elements being set free; these I propose to call\r\n_electrolytes_.[A] Water, therefore, is an electrolyte. The bodies which,\r\nlike nitric or sulphuric acids, are decomposed in a secondary manner (752.\r\n757.), are not included under this term. Then for _electro-chemically\r\ndecomposed_, I shall often use the term _electrolyzed_, derived in the same\r\nway, and implying that the body spoken of is separated into its components\r\nunder the influence of electricity: it is analogous in its sense and sound\r\nto _analyse_, which is derived in a similar manner. The term\r\n_electrolytical_ will be understood at once: muriatic acid is\r\nelectrolytical, boracic acid is not.\r\n\r\n  [A] [Greek: elektron], and [Greek: lyo], _soluo_. N. Electrolyte, V.\r\n  Electrolyze.\r\n\r\n665. Finally, I require a term to express those bodies which can pass to\r\nthe _electrodes_, or, as they are usually called, the poles. Substances are\r\nfrequently spoken of as being _electro-negative_, or _electro-positive_,\r\naccording as they go under the supposed influence of a direct attraction to\r\nthe positive or negative pole. But these terms are much too significant for\r\nthe use to which I should have to put them; for though the meanings are\r\nperhaps right, they are only hypothetical, and may be wrong; and then,\r\nthrough a very imperceptible, but still very dangerous, because continual,\r\ninfluence, they do great injury to science, by contracting and limiting the\r\nhabitual views of those engaged in pursuing it. I propose to distinguish\r\nsuch bodies by calling those _anions_[A] which go to the _anode_ of the\r\ndecomposing body; and those passing to the _cathode, cations_[B]; and when\r\nI have occasion to speak of these together, I shall call them _ions_. Thus\r\nthe chloride of lead is an _electrolyte_, and when _electrolyzed_ evolves\r\nthe two _ions_, chlorine and lead, the former being an _anion_, and the\r\nlatter a _cation_.\r\n\r\n  [A] [Greek: aniôn] _that which goes up._ (Neuter participle.)\r\n\r\n  [B] [Greek: katiôn] _that which goes down._\r\n\r\n666. These terms being once well-defined, will, I hope, in their use enable\r\nme to avoid much periphrasis and ambiguity of expression. I do not mean to\r\npress them into service more frequently than will be required, for I am\r\nfully aware that names are one thing and science another.\r\n\r\n667. It will be well understood that I am giving no opinion respecting the\r\nnature of the electric current now, beyond what I have done on former\r\noccasions (283. 517.); and that though I speak of the current as proceeding\r\nfrom the parts which are positive to those which are negative (663.), it is\r\nmerely in accordance with the conventional, though in some degree tacit,\r\nagreement entered into by scientific men, that they may have a constant,\r\ncertain, and definite means of referring to the direction of the forces of\r\nthat current.\r\n\r\n  [Since this paper was read, I have changed some of the terms which were\r\nfirst proposed, that I might employ only such as were at the same time\r\nsimple in their nature, clear in their reference, and free from\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ iv. _On some general conditions of Electro-chemical Decomposition._\r\n\r\n669. From the period when electro-chemical decomposition was first effected\r\nto the present time, it has been a remark, that those elements which, in\r\nthe ordinary phenomena of chemical affinity, were the most directly opposed\r\nto each other, and combined with the greatest attractive force, were those\r\nwhich were the most readily evolved at the opposite extremities of the\r\ndecomposing bodies (549.).\r\n\r\n670. If this result was evident when water was supposed to be essential to,\r\nand was present in, almost every case of such decomposition (472.), it is\r\nfar more evident now that it has been shown and proved that water is not\r\nnecessarily concerned in the phenomena (474.), and that other bodies much\r\nsurpass it in some of the effects supposed to be peculiar to that\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n671. Water, from its constitution and the nature of its elements, and from\r\nits frequent presence in cases of electrolytic action, has hitherto stood\r\nforemost in this respect. Though a compound formed by very powerful\r\naffinity, it yields up its elements under the influence of a very feeble\r\nelectric current; and it is doubtful whether a case of electrolyzation can\r\noccur, where, being present, it is not resolved into its first principles.\r\n\r\n672. The various oxides, chlorides, iodides, and salts, which I have shown\r\nare decomposable by the electric current when in the liquid state, under\r\nthe same general law with water (402.), illustrate in an equally striking\r\nmanner the activity, in such decompositions, of elements directly and\r\npowerfully opposed to each other by their chemical relations.\r\n\r\n673. On the other hand, bodies dependent on weak affinities very rarely\r\ngive way. Take, for instance, glasses: many of those formed of silica,\r\nlime, alkali, and oxide of lead, may be considered as little more than\r\nsolutions of substances one in another[A]. If bottle-glass be fused, and\r\nsubjected to the voltaic pile, it does not appear to be at all decomposed\r\n(408.). If flint glass, which contains substances more directly opposed, be\r\noperated upon, it suffers some decomposition; and if borate of lead glass,\r\nwhich is a definite chemical compound, be experimented with, it readily\r\nyields up its elements (408.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1830, p. 49.\r\n\r\n674. But the result which is found to be so striking in the instances\r\nquoted is not at all borne out by reference to other cases where a similar\r\nconsequence might have been expected. It may be said, that my own theory of\r\nelectro-chemical decomposition would lead to the expectation that all\r\ncompound bodies should give way under the influence of the electric current\r\nwith a facility proportionate to the strength of the affinity by which\r\ntheir elements, either proximate or ultimate, are combined. I am not sure\r\nthat that follows as a consequence of the theory; but if the objection is\r\nsupposed to be one presented by the facts, I have no doubt it will be\r\nremoved when we obtain a more intimate acquaintance with, and precise idea\r\nof, the nature of chemical affinity and the mode of action of an electric\r\ncurrent over it (518. 524.): besides which, it is just as directly opposed\r\nto any other theory of electro-chemical decomposition as the one I have\r\npropounded; for if it be admitted, as is generally the case, that the more\r\ndirectly bodies are opposed to each other in their attractive forces, the\r\nmore powerfully do they combine, then the objection applies with equal\r\nforce to any of the theories of electrolyzation which have been considered,\r\nand is an addition to those which I have taken against them.\r\n\r\n675. Amongst powerful compounds which are not decomposed, boracic acids\r\nstand prominent (408.). Then again, the iodide of sulphur, and the\r\nchlorides of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon, are not decomposable under\r\ncommon circumstances, though their elements are of a nature which would\r\nlead to a contrary expectation. Chloride of antimony (402. 690.), the\r\nhydro-carbons, acetic acid, ammonia, and many other bodies undecomposable\r\nby the voltaic pile, would seem to be formed by an affinity sufficiently\r\nstrong to indicate that the elements were so far contrasted in their nature\r\nas to sanction the expectation that, the pile would separate them,\r\nespecially as in some cases of mere solution (530. 544.), where the\r\naffinity must by comparison be very weak, separation takes place[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] With regard to solution, I have met with some reasons for\r\n  supposing that it will probably disappear as a cause of transference,\r\n  and intend resuming the consideration at a convenient opportunity.\r\n\r\n676. It must not be forgotten, however, that much of this difficulty, and\r\nperhaps the whole, may depend upon the absence of conducting power, which,\r\npreventing the transmission of the current, prevents of course the effects\r\ndue to it. All known compounds being non-conductors when solid, but\r\nconductors when liquid, are decomposed, with _perhaps_ the single exception\r\nat present known of periodide of mercury (679. 691.)[A]; and even water\r\nitself, which so easily yields up its elements when the current passes, if\r\nrendered quite pure, scarcely suffers change, because it then becomes a\r\nvery bad conductor.\r\n\r\n  [A] See now, 1340, 1341.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n677. If it should hereafter be proved that the want of decomposition in\r\nthose cases where, from chemical considerations, it might be so strongly\r\nexpected (669, 672. 674.), is due to the absence or deficiency of\r\nconducting power, it would also at the same time be proved that\r\ndecomposition _depends_ upon conduction, and not the latter upon the former\r\n(413.); and in water this seems to be very nearly decided. On the other\r\nhand, the conclusion is almost irresistible, that in electrolytes the power\r\nof transmitting the electricity across the substance is _dependent_ upon\r\ntheir capability of suffering decomposition; taking place only whilst they\r\nare decomposing, and being proportionate to the quantity of elements\r\nseparated (821.). I may not, however, stop to discuss this point\r\nexperimentally at present.\r\n\r\n678. When a compound contains such elements as are known to pass towards\r\nthe opposite extremities of the voltaic pile, still the proportions in\r\nwhich they are present appear to be intimately connected with capability in\r\nthe compound of suffering or resisting decomposition. Thus, the\r\nprotochloride of tin readily conducts, and is decomposed (402.), but the\r\nperchloride neither conducts nor is decomposed (406.). The protiodide of\r\ntin is decomposed when fluid (402.); the periodide is not (405.). The\r\nperiodide of mercury when fused is not decomposed (691.), even though it\r\ndoes conduct. I was unable to contrast it with the protiodide, the latter\r\nbeing converted into mercury and periodide by heat.\r\n\r\n679. These important differences induced me to look more closely to certain\r\nbinary compounds, with a view of ascertaining whether a _law_ regulating\r\nthe _decomposability_ according to some _relation of the proportionals or\r\nequivalents_ of the elements, could be discovered. The proto compounds\r\nonly, amongst those just referred to, were decomposable; and on referring\r\nto the substances quoted to illustrate the force and generality of the law\r\nof conduction and decomposition which I discovered (402.), it will be found\r\nthat all the oxides, chlorides, and iodides subject to it, except the\r\nchloride of antimony and the periodide of mercury, (to which may now\r\nperhaps be added corrosive sublimate,) are also decomposable, whilst many\r\nper compounds of the same elements, not subject to the law, were not so\r\n(405. 406.).\r\n\r\n680. The substances which appeared to form the strongest exceptions to this\r\ngeneral result were such bodies as the sulphuric, phosphoric, nitric,\r\narsenic, and other acids.\r\n\r\n681. On experimenting with sulphuric acid, I found no reason to believe\r\nthat it was by itself a conductor of, or decomposable by, electricity,\r\nalthough I had previously been of that opinion (552.). When very strong it\r\nis a much worse conductor than if diluted[A]. If then subjected to the\r\naction of a powerful battery, oxygen appears at the _anode_, or positive\r\nelectrode, although much is absorbed (728.), and hydrogen and sulphur\r\nappear at the _cathode_, or negative electrode. Now the hydrogen has with\r\nme always been pure, not sulphuretted, and has been deficient in proportion\r\nto the sulphur present, so that it is evident that when decomposition\r\noccurred water must have been decomposed. I endeavoured to make the\r\nexperiment with anhydrous sulphuric acid; and it appeared to me that, when\r\nfused, such acid was not a conductor, nor decomposed; but I had not enough\r\nof the dry acid in my possession to allow me to decide the point\r\nsatisfactorily. My belief is, that when sulphur appears during the action\r\nof the pile on sulphuric acid, it is the result of a secondary action, and\r\nthat the acid itself is not electrolyzable (757.).\r\n\r\n  [A] De la Rive.\r\n\r\n682. Phosphoric acid is, I believe, also in the same condition; but I have\r\nfound it impossible to decide the point, because of the difficulty of\r\noperating on fused anhydrous phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid which has\r\nonce obtained water cannot be deprived of it by heat alone. When heated,\r\nthe hydrated acid volatilizes. Upon subjecting phosphoric acid, fused upon\r\nthe ring end of a wire (401.), to the action of the voltaic apparatus, it\r\nconducted, and was decomposed; but gas, which I believe to be hydrogen, was\r\nalways evolved at the negative electrode, and the wire was not affected as\r\nwould have happened had phosphorus been separated. Gas was also evolved at\r\nthe positive electrode. From all the facts, I conclude it was the water and\r\nnot the acid which was decomposed.\r\n\r\n683. _Arsenic acid_. This substance conducted, and was decomposed; but it\r\ncontained water, and I was unable at the time to press the investigation so\r\nas to ascertain whether a fusible anhydrous arsenic acid could be obtained.\r\nIt forms, therefore, at present no exception to the general result.\r\n\r\n684. Nitrous acid, obtained by distilling nitrate of lead, and keeping it\r\nin contact with strong sulphuric acid, was found to conduct and decompose\r\nslowly. But on examination there were strong reasons for believing that\r\nwater was present, and that the decomposition and conduction depended upon\r\nit. I endeavoured to prepare a perfectly anhydrous portion, but could not\r\nspare the time required to procure an unexceptionable result.\r\n\r\n685. Nitric acid is a substance which I believe is not decomposed directly\r\nby the electric current. As I want the facts in illustration of the\r\ndistinction existing between primary and secondary decomposition, I will\r\nmerely refer to them in this place (752.).\r\n\r\n686. That these mineral acids should confer facility of conduction and\r\ndecomposition on water, is no proof that they are competent to favour and\r\nsuffer these actions in themselves. Boracic acid does the same thing,\r\nthough not decomposable. M. de la Rive has pointed out that chlorine has\r\nthis power also; but being to us an elementary substance, it cannot be due\r\nto its capability of suffering decomposition.\r\n\r\n687. _Chloride of sulphur_ does not conduct, nor is it decomposed. It\r\nconsists of single proportionals of its elements, but is not on that\r\naccount an exception to the rule (679.), which does not affirm that _all_\r\ncompounds of single proportionals of elements are decomposable, but that\r\nsuch as are decomposable are so constituted.\r\n\r\n688. _Protochloride of phosphorus_ does not conduct nor become decomposed.\r\n\r\n689. _Protochloride of carbon_ does not conduct nor suffer decomposition.\r\nIn association with this substance, I submitted the _hydro-chloride of\r\ncarbon_ from olefiant gas and chlorine to the action of the electric\r\ncurrent; but it also refused to conduct or yield up its elements.\r\n\r\n600. With regard to the exceptions (679.), upon closer examination some of\r\nthem disappear. Chloride of antimony (a compound of one proportional of\r\nantimony and one and a half of chlorine) of recent preparation was put into\r\na tube (fig. 68.) (789.), and submitted when fused to the action of the\r\ncurrent, the positive electrode being of plumbago. No electricity passed,\r\nand no appearance of decomposition was visible at first; but when the\r\npositive and negative electrodes were brought very near each other in the\r\nchloride, then a feeble action occurred and a feeble current passed. The\r\neffect altogether was so small (although quite amenable to the law before\r\ngiven (394.)), and so unlike the decomposition and conduction occurring in\r\nall the other cases, that I attribute it to the presence of a minute\r\nquantity of water, (for which this and many other chlorides have strong\r\nattractions, producing hydrated chlorides,) or perhaps of a true\r\nprotochloride consisting of single proportionals (695, 796.).\r\n\r\n691. _Periodide of mercury_ being examined in the same manner, was found\r\nmost distinctly to insulate whilst solid, but conduct when fluid, according\r\nto the law of _liquido-conduction_ (402.); but there was no appearance of\r\ndecomposition. No iodine appeared at the _anode_, nor mercury or other\r\nsubstance at the _cathode_. The case is, therefore, no exception to the\r\nrule, that only compounds of single proportionals are decomposable; but it\r\nis an exception, and I think the only one, to the statement, that all\r\nbodies subject to the law of liquido-conduction are decomposable. I\r\nincline, however, to believe, that a portion of protiodide of mercury is\r\nretained dissolved in the periodide, and that to its slow decomposition the\r\nfeeble conducting power is due. Periodide would be formed, as a secondary\r\nresult, at the _anode_; and the mercury at the _cathode_ would also form,\r\nas a secondary result, protiodide. Both these bodies would mingle with the\r\nfluid mass, and thus no final separation appear, notwithstanding the\r\ncontinued decomposition.\r\n\r\n692. When _perchloride of mercury_ was subjected to the voltaic current, it\r\ndid not conduct in the solid state, but it did conduct when fluid. I think,\r\nalso, that in the latter case it was decomposed; but there are many\r\ninterfering circumstances which require examination before a positive\r\nconclusion can be drawn[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] With regard to perchloride and periodide of mercury, see now 1340,\r\n  1341.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n693. When the ordinary protoxide of antimony is subjected to the voltaic\r\ncurrent in a fused state, it also is decomposed, although the effect from\r\nother causes soon ceases (402, 801.). This oxide consists of one\r\nproportional of antimony and one and a half of oxygen, and is therefore an\r\nexception to the general law assumed. But in working with this oxide and\r\nthe chloride, I observed facts which lead me to doubt whether the compounds\r\nusually called the protoxide and the protochloride do not often contain\r\nother compounds, consisting of single proportions, which are the true proto\r\ncompounds, and which, in the case of the oxide, might give rise to the\r\ndecomposition above described.\r\n\r\n694. The ordinary sulphuret of antimony its considered as being the\r\ncompound with the smallest quantity of sulphur, and analogous in its\r\nproportions to the ordinary protoxide. But I find that if it be fused with\r\nmetallic antimony, a new sulphuret is formed, containing much more of the\r\nmetal than the former, and separating distinctly, when fused, both from the\r\npure metal on the one hand, and the ordinary gray sulphuret on the other.\r\nIn some rough experiments, the metal thus taken up by the ordinary\r\nsulphuret of antimony was equal to half the proportion of that previously\r\nin the sulphuret, in which case the new sulphuret would consist of _single_\r\nproportionals.\r\n\r\n695. When this new sulphuret was dissolved in muriatic acid, although a\r\nlittle antimony separated, yet it appeared to me that a true protochloride,\r\nconsisting of _single_ proportionals, was formed, and from that by\r\nalkalies, &c., a true protoxide, consisting also of _single_ proportionals,\r\nwas obtainable. But I could not stop to ascertain this matter strictly by\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n696. I believe, however, that there is such an oxide; that it is often\r\npresent in variable proportions in what is commonly called protoxide,\r\nthrowing uncertainty upon the results of its analysis, and causing the\r\nelectrolytic decomposition above described[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In relation to this and the three preceding paragraphs, and also\r\n  801, see Berzelius's correction of the nature of the supposed now\r\n  sulphuret and oxide, Phil. Mag. 1836, vol. viii. 476: and for the\r\n  probable explanation of the effects obtained with the protoxide, refer\r\n  to 1340, 1341.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n697. Upon the whole, it appears probable that all those binary compounds of\r\nelementary bodies which are capable of being electrolyzed when fluid, but\r\nnot whilst solid, according to the law of liquido-conduction (394.),\r\nconsist of single proportionals of their elementary principles; and it may\r\nbe because of their departure from this simplicity of composition, that\r\nboracic acid, ammonia, perchlorides, periodides, and many other direct\r\ncompounds of elements, are indecomposable.\r\n\r\n698. With regard to salts and combinations of compound bodies, the same\r\nsimple relation does not appear to hold good. I could not decide this by\r\nbisulphates of the alkalies, for as long as the second proportion of acid\r\nremained, water was retained with it. The fused salts conducted, and were\r\ndecomposed; but hydrogen always appeared at the negative electrode.\r\n\r\n699. A biphosphate of soda was prepared by heating, and ultimately fusing,\r\nthe ammonia-phosphate of soda. In this case the fused bisalt conducted, and\r\nwas decomposed; but a little gas appeared at the negative electrode; and\r\nthough I believe the salt itself was electrolyzed, I am not quite satisfied\r\nthat water was entirely absent.\r\n\r\n700. Then a biborate of soda was prepared; and this, I think, is an\r\nunobjectionable case. The salt, when fused, conducted, and was decomposed,\r\nand gas appeared at both electrodes: even when the boracic acid was\r\nincreased to three proportionals, the same effect took place.\r\n\r\n701. Hence this class of compound combinations does not seem to be subject\r\nto the same simple law as the former class of binary combinations. Whether\r\nwe may find reason to consider them as mere solutions of the compound of\r\nsingle proportionals in the excess of acid, is a matter which, with some\r\napparent exceptions occurring amongst the sulphurets, must be left for\r\ndecision by future examination.\r\n\r\n702. In any investigation of these points, great care must be taken to\r\nexclude water; for if present, secondary effects are so frequently produced\r\nas often seemingly to indicate an electro-decomposition of substances, when\r\nno true result of the kind has occurred (742, &c.).\r\n\r\n703. It is evident that all the cases in which decomposition _does not\r\noccur, may_ depend upon the want of conduction (677. 413.); but that does\r\nnot at all lessen the interest excited by seeing the great difference of\r\neffect due to a change, not in the nature of the elements, but merely in\r\ntheir proportions; especially in any attempt which may be made to elucidate\r\nand expound the beautiful theory put forth by Sir Humphry Davy[A], and\r\nillustrated by Berzelius and other eminent philosophers, that ordinary\r\nchemical affinity is a mere result of the electrical attractions of the\r\nparticles of matter.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1807, pp. 32, 39; also 1826, pp. 387,\r\n  389.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ v. _On a new measure of Volta-electricity._\r\n\r\n704. I have already said, when engaged in reducing common and voltaic\r\nelectricity to one standard of measurement (377.), and again when\r\nintroducing my theory of electro-chemical decomposition (504. 505. 510.),\r\nthat the chemical decomposing action of a current _is constant for a\r\nconstant quantity of electricity_, notwithstanding the greatest variations\r\nin its sources, in its intensity, in the size of the _electrodes_ used, in\r\nthe nature of the conductors (or non-conductors (307.)) through which it is\r\npassed, or in other circumstances. The conclusive proofs of the truth of\r\nthese statements shall be given almost immediately (783, &c.).\r\n\r\n705. I endeavoured upon this law to construct an instrument which should\r\nmeasure out the electricity passing through it, and which, being interposed\r\nin the course of the current used in any particular experiment, should\r\nserve at pleasure, either as a _comparative standard_ of effect, or as a\r\n_positive measurer_ of this subtile agent.\r\n\r\n706. There is no substance better fitted, under ordinary circumstances, to\r\nbe the indicating body in such an instrument than water; for it is\r\ndecomposed with facility when rendered a better conductor by the addition\r\nof acids or salts; its elements may in numerous cases be obtained and\r\ncollected without any embarrassment from secondary action, and, being\r\ngaseous, they are in the best physical condition for separation and\r\nmeasurement. Water, therefore, acidulated by sulphuric acid, is the\r\nsubstance I shall generally refer to, although it may become expedient in\r\npeculiar cases or forms of experiment to use other bodies (843.).\r\n\r\n707. The first precaution needful in the construction of the instrument was\r\nto avoid the recombination of the evolved gases, an effect which the\r\npositive electrode has been found so capable of producing (571.). For this\r\npurpose various forms of decomposing apparatus were used. The first\r\nconsisted of straight tubes, each containing a plate and wire of platina\r\nsoldered together by gold, and fixed hermetically in the glass at the\r\nclosed extremity of the tube (Plate V. fig. 60.). The tubes were about\r\neight inches long, 0.7 of an inch in diameter, and graduated. The platina\r\nplates were about an inch long, as wide as the tubes would permit, and\r\nadjusted as near to the mouths of the tubes as was consistent with the safe\r\ncollection of the gases evolved. In certain cases, where it was required to\r\nevolve the elements upon as small a surface as possible, the metallic\r\nextremity, instead of being a plate, consisted of the wire bent into the\r\nform of a ring (fig. 61.). When these tubes were used as measurers, they\r\nwere filled with the dilute sulphuric acid, inverted in a basin of the same\r\nliquid (fig. 62.), and placed in an inclined position, with their mouths\r\nnear to each other, that as little decomposing matter should intervene as\r\npossible; and also, in such a direction that the platina plates should be\r\nin vertical planes (720).\r\n\r\n708. Another form of apparatus is that delineated (fig. 63.). The tube is\r\nbent in the middle; one end is closed; in that end is fixed a wire and\r\nplate, _a_, proceeding so far downwards, that, when in the position\r\nfigured, it shall be as near to the angle as possible, consistently with\r\nthe collection, at the closed extremity of the tube, of all the gas evolved\r\nagainst it. The plane of this plate is also perpendicular (720.). The other\r\nmetallic termination, _b_, is introduced at the time decomposition is to be\r\neffected, being brought as near the angle as possible, without causing any\r\ngas to pass from it towards the closed end of the instrument. The gas\r\nevolved against it is allowed to escape.\r\n\r\n709. The third form of apparatus contains both electrodes in the same tube;\r\nthe transmission, therefore, of the electricity, and the consequent\r\ndecomposition, is far more rapid than in the separate tubes. The resulting\r\ngas is the sum of the portions evolved at the two electrodes, and the\r\ninstrument is better adapted than either of the former as a measurer of the\r\nquantity of voltaic electricity transmitted in ordinary cases. It consists\r\nof a straight tube (fig. 64.) closed at the upper extremity, and graduated,\r\nthrough the sides of which pass platina wires (being fused into the glass),\r\nwhich are connected with two plates within. The tube is fitted by grinding\r\ninto one mouth of a double-necked bottle. If the latter be one-half or\r\ntwo-thirds full of the dilute sulphuric acid (706.), it will, upon\r\ninclination of the whole, flow into the tube and fill it. When an electric\r\ncurrent is passed through the instrument, the gases evolved against the\r\nplates collect in the upper portion of the tube, and are not subject to the\r\nrecombining power of the platina.\r\n\r\n710. Another form of the instrument is given at fig. 65.\r\n\r\n711. A fifth form is delineated (fig. 66.). This I have found exceedingly\r\nuseful in experiments continued in succession for days together, and where\r\nlarge quantities of indicating gas were to be collected. It is fixed on a\r\nweighted foot, and has the form of a small retort containing the two\r\nelectrodes: the neck is narrow, and sufficiently long to deliver gas\r\nissuing from it into a jar placed in a small pneumatic trough. The\r\nelectrode chamber, sealed hermetically at the part held in the stand, is\r\nfive inches in length, and 0.6 of an inch in diameter; the neck about nine\r\ninches in length, and 0.4 of an inch in diameter internally. The figure\r\nwill fully indicate the construction.\r\n\r\n712. It can hardly be requisite to remark, that in the arrangement of any\r\nof these forms of apparatus, they, and the wires connecting them with the\r\nsubstance, which is collaterally subjected to the action of the same\r\nelectric current, should be so far insulated as to ensure a certainty that\r\nall the electricity which passes through the one shall also be transmitted\r\nthrough the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n713. Next to the precaution of collecting the gases, if mingled, out of\r\ncontact with the platinum, was the necessity of testing the law of a\r\n_definite electrolytic_ action, upon water at least, under all varieties of\r\ncondition; that, with a conviction of its certainty, might also be obtained\r\na knowledge of those interfering circumstances which would require to be\r\npractically guarded against.\r\n\r\n714. The first point investigated was the influence or indifference of\r\nextensive variations in the size of the electrodes, for which purpose\r\ninstruments like those last described (709. 710. 711.) were used. One of\r\nthese had plates 0.7 of an inch wide, and nearly four inches long; another\r\nhad plates only 0.5 of an inch wide, and 0.8 of an inch long; a third had\r\nwires 0.02 of an inch in diameter, and three inches long; and a fourth,\r\nsimilar wires only half an inch in length. Yet when these were filled with\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, and, being placed in succession, had one common\r\ncurrent of electricity passed through them, very nearly the same quantity\r\nof gas was evolved in all. The difference was sometimes in favour of one\r\nand sometimes on the side of another; but the general result was that the\r\nlargest quantity of gases was evolved at the smallest electrodes, namely,\r\nthose consisting merely of platina wires.\r\n\r\n715. Experiments of a similar kind were made with the single-plate,\r\nstraight tubes (707.), and also with the curved tubes (708.), with similar\r\nconsequences; and when these, with the former tubes, were arranged together\r\nin various ways, the result, as to the equality of action of large and\r\nsmall metallic surfaces when delivering and receiving the same current of\r\nelectricity, was constantly the same. As an illustration, the following\r\nnumbers are given. An instrument with two wires evolved 74.3 volumes of\r\nmixed gases; another with plates 73.25 volumes; whilst the sum of the\r\noxygen and hydrogen in two separate tubes amounted to 73.65 volumes. In\r\nanother experiment the volumes were 55.3, 55.3, and 54.4.\r\n\r\n716. But it was observed in these experiments, that in single-plate tubes\r\n(707.) more hydrogen was evolved at the negative electrode than was\r\nproportionate to the oxygen at the positive electrode; and generally, also,\r\nmore than was proportionate to the oxygen and hydrogen in a double-plate\r\ntube. Upon more minutely examining these effects, I was led to refer them,\r\nand also the differences between wires and plates (714.), to the solubility\r\nof the gases evolved, especially at the positive electrode.\r\n\r\n717. When the positive and negative electrodes are equal in surface, the\r\nbubbles which rise from them in dilute sulphuric acid are always different\r\nin character. Those from the positive plate are exceedingly small, and\r\nseparate instantly from every part of the surface of the metal, in\r\nconsequence of its perfect cleanliness (633.); whilst in the liquid they\r\ngive it a hazy appearance, from their number and minuteness; are easily\r\ncarried down by currents, and therefore not only present far greater\r\nsurface of contact with the liquid than larger bubbles would do, but are\r\nretained a much longer time in mixture with it. But the bubbles at the\r\nnegative surface, though they constitute twice the volume of the gas at the\r\npositive electrode, are nevertheless very inferior in number. They do not\r\nrise so universally from every part of the surface, but seem to be evolved\r\nat different parts; and though so much larger, they appear to cling to the\r\nmetal, separating with difficulty from it, and when separated, instantly\r\nrising to the top of the liquid. If, therefore, oxygen and hydrogen had\r\nequal solubility in, or powers of combining with, water under similar\r\ncircumstances, still under the present conditions the oxygen would be far\r\nthe most liable to solution; but when to these is added its well-known\r\npower of forming a compound with water, it is no longer surprising that\r\nsuch a compound should be produced in small quantities at the positive\r\nelectrode; and indeed the blenching power which some philosophers have\r\nobserved in a solution at this electrode, when chlorine and similar bodies\r\nhave been carefully excluded, is probably due to the formation there, in\r\nthis manner, of oxywater.\r\n\r\n718. That more gas was collected from the wires than from the plates, I\r\nattribute to the circumstance, that as equal quantities were evolved in\r\nequal times, the bubbles at the wires having been more rapidly produced, in\r\nrelation to any part of the surface, must have been much larger; have been\r\ntherefore in contact with the fluid by a much smaller surface, and for a\r\nmuch shorter time than those at the plates; hence less solution and a\r\ngreater amount collected.\r\n\r\n719. There was also another effect produced, especially by the use of large\r\nelectrodes, which was both a consequence and a proof of the solution of\r\npart of the gas evolved there. The collected gas, when examined, was found\r\nto contain small portions of nitrogen. This I attribute to the presence of\r\nair dissolved in the acid used for decomposition. It is a well-known fact,\r\nthat when bubbles of a gas but slightly soluble in water or solutions pass\r\nthrough them, the portion of this gas which is dissolved displaces a\r\nportion of that previously in union with the liquid: and so, in the\r\ndecompositions under consideration, as the oxygen dissolves, it displaces a\r\npart of the air, or at least of the nitrogen, previously united to the\r\nacid; and this effect takes place _most extensively_ with large plates,\r\nbecause the gas evolved at them is in the most favourable condition for\r\nsolution,\r\n\r\n720. With the intention of avoiding this solubility of the gases as much as\r\npossible, I arranged the decomposing plates in a vertical position (707.\r\n708.), that the bubbles might quickly escape upwards, and that the downward\r\ncurrents in the fluid should not meet ascending currents of gas. This\r\nprecaution I found to assist greatly in producing constant results, and\r\nespecially in experiments to be hereafter referred to, in which other\r\nliquids than dilute sulphuric acid, as for instance solution of potash,\r\nwere used.\r\n\r\n721. The irregularities in the indications of the measurer proposed,\r\narising from the solubility just referred to, are but small, and may be\r\nvery nearly corrected by comparing the results of two or three experiments.\r\nThey may also be almost entirely avoided by selecting that solution which\r\nis found to favour them in the least degree (728.); and still further by\r\ncollecting the hydrogen only, and using that as the indicating gas; for\r\nbeing much less soluble than oxygen, being evolved with twice the rapidity\r\nand in larger bubbles (717.), it can be collected more perfectly and in\r\ngreater purity.\r\n\r\n722. From the foregoing and many other experiments, it results that\r\n_variation in the size of the electrodes causes no variation in the\r\nchemical action of a given quantity of electricity upon water_.\r\n\r\n723. The next point in regard to which the principle of constant\r\nelectro-chemical action was tested, was _variation of intensity_. In the\r\nfirst place, the preceding experiments were repeated, using batteries of an\r\n_equal_ number of plates, _strongly_ and _weakly_ charged; but the results\r\nwere alike. They were then repeated, using batteries sometimes containing\r\nforty, and at other times only five pairs of plates; but the results were\r\nstill the same. _Variations therefore in the intensity_, caused by\r\ndifference in the strength of charge, or in the number of alternations\r\nused, _produced no difference as to the equal action of large and small\r\nelectrodes_.\r\n\r\n724. Still these results did not prove that variation in the intensity of\r\nthe current was not accompanied by a corresponding variation in the\r\nelectro-chemical effects, since the actions at _all_ the surfaces might\r\nhave increased or diminished together. The deficiency in the evidence is,\r\nhowever, completely supplied by the former experiments on different-sized\r\nelectrodes; for with variation in the size of these, a variation in the\r\nintensity must have occurred. The intensity of an electric current\r\ntraversing conductors alike in their nature, quality, and length, is\r\nprobably as the quantity of electricity passing through a given sectional\r\narea perpendicular to the current, divided by the time (360. _note_); and\r\ntherefore when large plates were contrasted with wires separated by an\r\nequal length of the same decomposing conductor (714.), whilst one current\r\nof electricity passed through both arrangements, that electricity must have\r\nbeen in a very different state, as to _tension_, between the plates and\r\nbetween the wires; yet the chemical results were the same.\r\n\r\n725. The difference in intensity, under the circumstances described, may be\r\neasily shown practically, by arranging two decomposing apparatus as in fig.\r\n67, where the same fluid is subjected to the decomposing power of the same\r\ncurrent of electricity, passing in the vessel A. between large platina\r\nplates, and in the vessel B. between small wires. If a third decomposing\r\napparatus, such as that delineated fig. 66. (711.), be connected with the\r\nwires at _ab_, fig. 67, it will serve sufficiently well, by the degree of\r\ndecomposition occurring in it, to indicate the relative state of the two\r\nplates as to intensity; and if it then be applied in the same way, as a\r\ntest of the state of the wires at _a'b'_, it will, by the increase of\r\ndecomposition within, show how much greater the intensity is there than at\r\nthe former points. The connexions of P and N with the voltaic battery are\r\nof course to be continued during the whole time.\r\n\r\n726. A third form of experiment, in which difference of intensity was\r\nobtained, for the purpose of testing the principle of equal chemical\r\naction, was to arrange three volta-electrometers, so that after the\r\nelectric current had passed through one, it should divide into two parts,\r\neach of which should traverse one of the remaining instruments, and should\r\nthen reunite. The sum of the decomposition in the two latter vessels was\r\nalways equal to the decomposition in the former vessel. But the _intensity_\r\nof the divided current could not be the same as that it had in its original\r\nstate; and therefore _variation of intensity has no influence on the\r\nresults if the quantity of electricity remain the same_. The experiment, in\r\nfact, resolves itself simply into an increase in the size of the electrodes\r\n(725.).\r\n\r\n727. The _third point_, in respect to which the principle of equal\r\nelectro-chemical action on water was tested, was _variation of the strength\r\nof the solution used_. In order to render the water a conductor, sulphuric\r\nacid had been added to it (707.); and it did not seem unlikely that this\r\nsubstance, with many others, might render the water more subject to\r\ndecomposition, the electricity remaining the same in quantity. But such did\r\nnot prove to be the case. Diluted sulphuric acid, of different strengths,\r\nwas introduced into different decomposing apparatus, and submitted\r\nsimultaneously to the action of the same electric current (714.). Slight\r\ndifferences occurred, as before, sometimes in one direction, sometimes in\r\nanother; but the final result was, that _exactly the same quantity of water\r\nwas decomposed in all the solutions by the same quantity of electricity_,\r\nthough the sulphuric acid in some was seventy-fold what it was in others.\r\nThe strengths used were of specific gravity 1.495, and downwards.\r\n\r\n728. When an acid having a specific gravity of about 1.336 was employed,\r\nthe results were most uniform, and the oxygen and hydrogen (716.) most\r\nconstantly in the right proportion to each other. Such an acid gave more\r\ngas than one much weaker acted upon by the same current, apparently because\r\nit had less solvent power. If the acid were very strong, then a remarkable\r\ndisappearance of oxygen took place; thus, one made by mixing two measures\r\nof strong oil of vitriol with one of water, gave forty-two volumes of\r\nhydrogen, but only twelve of oxygen. The hydrogen was very nearly the same\r\nwith that evolved from acid of the specific gravity 1.232. I have not yet\r\nhad time to examine minutely the circumstances attending the disappearance\r\nof the oxygen in this case, but imagine it is due to the formation of\r\noxywater, which Thenard has shown is favoured by the presence of acid.\r\n\r\n729. Although not necessary for the practical use of the instrument I am\r\ndescribing, yet as connected with the important point of constant\r\nchemical action upon water, I now investigated the effects produced by an\r\nelectro-electric current passing through aqueous solutions of acids, salts,\r\nand compounds, exceedingly different from each other in their nature, and\r\nfound them to yield astonishingly uniform results. But many of them which\r\nare connected with a secondary action will be more usefully described\r\nhereafter (778.).\r\n\r\n730. When solutions of caustic potassa or soda, or sulphate of magnesia, or\r\nsulphate of soda, were acted upon by the electric current, just as much\r\noxygen and hydrogen was evolved from them as from the diluted sulphuric\r\nacid, with which they were compared. When a solution of ammonia, rendered a\r\nbetter conductor by sulphate of ammonia (554.), or a solution of\r\nsubcarbonate of potassa was experimented with, the _hydrogen_ evolved was\r\nin the same quantity as that set free from the diluted sulphuric acid with\r\nwhich they were compared. Hence _changes in the nature of the solution do\r\nnot alter the constancy of electrolytic action upon water_.\r\n\r\n731. I have already said, respecting large and small electrodes, that\r\nchange of order caused no change in the general effect (715.). The same was\r\nthe case with different solutions, or with different intensities; and\r\nhowever the circumstances of an experiment might be varied, the results\r\ncame forth exceedingly consistent, and proved that the electro-chemical\r\naction was still the same.\r\n\r\n732. I consider the foregoing investigation as sufficient to prove the very\r\nextraordinary and important principle with respect to WATER, _that when\r\nsubjected to the influence of the electric current, a quantity of it is\r\ndecomposed exactly proportionate to the quantity of electricity which has\r\npassed_, notwithstanding the thousand variations in the conditions and\r\ncircumstances under which it may at the time be placed; and further, that\r\nwhen the interference of certain secondary effects (742. &c.), together\r\nwith the solution or recombination of the gas and the evolution of air, are\r\nguarded against, _the products of the decomposition may be collected with\r\nsuch accuracy, as to afford a very excellent and valuable measurer of the\r\nelectricity concerned in their evolution_.\r\n\r\n733. The forms of instrument which I have given, figg. 64, 65, 66. (709.\r\n710. 711.), are probably those which will be found most useful, as they\r\nindicate the quantity of electricity by the largest volume of gases, and\r\ncause the least obstruction to the passage of the current. The fluid which\r\nmy present experience leads me to prefer, is a solution of sulphuric acid\r\nof specific gravity about 1.336, or from that to 1.25; but it is very\r\nessential that there should be no organic substance, nor any vegetable\r\nacid, nor other body, which, by being liable to the action of the oxygen or\r\nhydrogen evolved at the electrodes (773. &c.), shall diminish their\r\nquantity, or add other gases to them.\r\n\r\n734. In many cases when the instrument is used as a _comparative standard_,\r\nor even as _a measurer_, it may be desirable to collect the hydrogen only,\r\nas being less liable to absorption or disappearance in other ways than the\r\noxygen; whilst at the same time its volume is so large, as to render it a\r\ngood and sensible indicator. In such cases the first and second form of\r\napparatus have been used, figg. 62, 63. (707. 708.). The indications\r\nobtained were very constant, the variations being much smaller than in\r\nthose forms of apparatus collecting both gases; and they can also be\r\nprocured when solutions are used in comparative experiments, which,\r\nyielding no oxygen or only secondary results of its action, can give no\r\nindications if the educts at both electrodes be collected. Such is the case\r\nwhen solutions of ammonia, muriatic acid, chlorides, iodides, acetates or\r\nother vegetable salts, &c., are employed.\r\n\r\n735. In a few cases, as where solutions of metallic salts liable to\r\nreduction at the negative electrode are acted upon, the oxygen may be\r\nadvantageously used as the measuring substance. This is the case, for\r\ninstance, with sulphate of copper.\r\n\r\n736. There are therefore two general forms of the instrument which I submit\r\nas a measurer of electricity; one, in which both the gases of the water\r\ndecomposed are collected (709. 710. 711.); and the other, in which a single\r\ngas, as the hydrogen only, is used (707. 708.). When referred to as a\r\n_comparative instrument_, (a use I shall now make of it very extensively,)\r\nit will not often require particular precaution in the observation; but\r\nwhen used as an _absolute measurer_, it will be needful that the barometric\r\npressure and the temperature be taken into account, and that the graduation\r\nof the instruments should be to one scale; the hundredths and smaller\r\ndivisions of a cubical inch are quite fit for this purpose, and the\r\nhundredth may be very conveniently taken as indicating a DEGREE of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n737. It can scarcely be needful to point out further than has been done how\r\nthis instrument is to be used. It is to be introduced into the course of\r\nthe electric current, the action of which is to be exerted anywhere else,\r\nand if 60° or 70° of electricity are to be measured out, either in one or\r\nseveral portions, the current, whether strong or weak, is to be continued\r\nuntil the gas in the tube occupies that number of divisions or hundredths\r\nof a cubical inch. Or if a quantity competent to produce a certain effect\r\nis to be measured, the effect is to be obtained, and then the indication\r\nread off. In exact experiments it is necessary to correct the volume of gas\r\nfor changes in temperature and pressure, and especially for moisture[A].\r\nFor the latter object the volta-electrometer (fig. 66.) is most accurate,\r\nas its gas can be measured over water, whilst the others retain it over\r\nacid or saline solutions.\r\n\r\n  [A] For a simple table of correction for moisture, I may take the\r\n  liberty of referring to my Chemical Manipulation, edition of 1830,\r\n  p. 376.\r\n\r\n738. I have not hesitated to apply the term _degree_ (736.), in analogy\r\nwith the use made of it with respect to another most important imponderable\r\nagent, namely, heat; and as the definite expansion of air, water, mercury,\r\n&c., is there made use of to measure heat, so the equally definite\r\nevolution of gases is here turned to a similar use for electricity.\r\n\r\n739. The instrument offers the only _actual measurer_ of voltaic\r\nelectricity which we at present possess. For without being at all affected\r\nby variations in time or intensity, or alterations in the current itself,\r\nof any kind, or from any cause, or even of intermissions of action, it\r\ntakes note with accuracy of the quantity of electricity which has passed\r\nthrough it, and reveals that quantity by inspection; I have therefore named\r\nit a VOLTA-ELECTROMETER.\r\n\r\n740. Another mode of measuring volta-electricity may be adopted with\r\nadvantage in many cases, dependent on the quantities of metals or other\r\nsubstances evolved either as primary or as secondary results; but I refrain\r\nfrom enlarging on this use of the products, until the principles on which\r\ntheir constancy depends have been fully established (791. 848.);\r\n\r\n741. By the aid of this instrument I have been able to establish the\r\ndefinite character of electro-chemical action in its most general sense;\r\nand I am persuaded it will become of the utmost use in the extensions of\r\nthe science which these views afford. I do not pretend to have made its\r\ndetail perfect, but to have demonstrated the truth of the principle, and\r\nthe utility of the application[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] As early as the year 1811, Messrs. Gay-Lussac and Thénard employed\r\n  chemical decomposition as a measure of the electricity of the voltaic\r\n  pile. See _Recherches Physico-chymiques_, p. 12. The principles and\r\n  precautions by which it becomes an exact measure were of course not\r\n  then known.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ vi. _On the primary or secondary character of the bodies evolved at the\r\nElectrodes._\r\n\r\n742. Before the _volta-electrometer_ could be employed in determining, as a\r\n_general law_, the constancy of electro-decomposition, it became necessary\r\nto examine a distinction, already recognised among scientific men, relative\r\nto the products of that action, namely, their primary or secondary\r\ncharacter; and, if possible, by some general rule or principle, to decide\r\nwhen they were of the one or the other kind. It will appear hereafter that\r\ngreat mistakes inspecting electro-chemical action and its consequences have\r\narisen from confounding these two classes of results together.\r\n\r\n743. When a substance under decomposition yields at the electrodes those\r\nbodies uncombined and unaltered which the electric current has separated,\r\nthen they may be considered as primary results, even though themselves\r\ncompounds. Thus the oxygen and hydrogen from water are primary results; and\r\nso also are the acid and alkali (themselves compound bodies) evolved from\r\nsulphate of soda. But when the substances separated by the current are\r\nchanged at the electrodes before their appearance, then they give rise to\r\nsecondary results, although in many cases the bodies evolved are\r\nelementary.\r\n\r\n744. These secondary results occur in two ways, being sometimes due to the\r\nmutual action of the evolved substance and the matter of the electrode, and\r\nsometimes to its action upon the substances contained in the body itself\r\nunder decomposition. Thus, when carbon is made the positive electrode in\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, carbonic oxide and carbonic acid occasionally appear\r\nthere instead of oxygen; for the latter, acting upon the matter of the\r\nelectrode, produces these secondary results. Or if the positive electrode,\r\nin a solution of nitrate or acetate of lead, be platina, then peroxide of\r\nlead appears there, equally a secondary result with the former, but now\r\ndepending upon an action of the oxygen on a substance in the solution.\r\nAgain, when ammonia is decomposed by platina electrodes, nitrogen appears\r\nat the _anode_[A]; but though an _elementary_ body, it is a _secondary_\r\nresult in this case, being derived from the chemical action of the oxygen\r\nelectrically evolved there, upon the ammonia in the surrounding solution\r\n(554.). In the same manner when aqueous solutions of metallic salts are\r\ndecomposed by the current, the metals evolved at the _cathode_, though\r\nelements, are _always_ secondary results, and not immediate consequences of\r\nthe decomposing power of the electric current.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, 1801, tom. li. p. 167.\r\n\r\n745. Many of these secondary results are extremely valuable; for instance,\r\nall the interesting compounds which M. Becquerel has obtained by feeble\r\nelectric currents are of this nature; but they are essentially chemical,\r\nand must, in the theory of electrolytic action, be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom those which are directly due to the action of the electric current.\r\n\r\n746. The nature of the substances evolved will often lead to a correct\r\njudgement of their primary or secondary character, but is not sufficient\r\nalone to establish that point. Thus, nitrogen is said to be attracted\r\nsometimes by the positive and sometimes by the negative electrode,\r\naccording to the bodies with which it may be combined (554. 555.), and it\r\nis on such occasions evidently viewed as a primary result[A]; but I think I\r\nshall show, that, when it appears at the positive electrode, or rather at\r\nthe _anode_, it is a secondary result (748.). Thus, also, Sir Humphry\r\nDavy[B], and with him the great body of chemical philosophers, (including\r\nmyself,) have given the appearance of copper, lead, tin, silver, gold, &c.,\r\nat the negative electrode, when their aqueous solutions were acted upon by\r\nthe voltaic current, as proofs that the metals, as a class, were attracted\r\nto that surface; thus assuming the metal, in each case, to be a primary\r\nresult. These, however, I expect to prove, are all secondary results; the\r\nmere consequence of chemical action, and no proofs either of the attraction\r\nor of the law announced respecting their places[C].\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, 1804, tom. li. p. 172.\r\n\r\n  [B] Elements of Chemical Philosophy, pp. 144. 161.\r\n\r\n  [C] It is remarkable that up to 1804 it was the received opinion that\r\n  the metals were reduced by the nascent hydrogen. At that date the\r\n  general opinion was reversed by Hisinger and Berzelius (Annales de\r\n  Chimie, 1804, tom. li. p. 174,), who stated that the metals were\r\n  evolved directly by the electricity: in which opinion it appears, from\r\n  that time, Davy coincided (Philosophical Transactions, 1826, p. 388).\r\n\r\n747. But when we take to our assistance the law of _constant\r\nelectro-chemical action_ already proved with regard to water (732.), and\r\nwhich I hope to extend satisfactorily to all bodies (821.), and consider\r\nthe _quantities_ as well as the _nature_ of the substances set free, a\r\ngenerally accurate judgement of the primary or secondary character of the\r\nresults may be formed: and this important point, so essential to the theory\r\nof electrolyzation, since it decides what are the particles directly under\r\nthe influence of the current, (distinguishing them from such as are not\r\naffected,) and what are the results to be expected, may be established with\r\nsuch degree of certainty as to remove innumerable ambiguities and doubtful\r\nconsiderations from this branch of the science.\r\n\r\n748. Let us apply these principles to the case of ammonia, and the supposed\r\ndetermination of nitrogen to one or the other _electrode_ (554. 555,). A\r\npure strong solution of ammonia is as bad a conductor, and therefore as\r\nlittle liable to electrolyzation, as pure water; but when sulphate of\r\nammonia is dissolved in it, the whole becomes a conductor; nitrogen\r\n_almost_ and occasionally _quite_ pure is evolved at the _anode_, and\r\nhydrogen at the _cathode_; the ratio of the volume of the former to that of\r\nthe latter varying, but being as 1 to about 3 or 4. This result would seem\r\nat first to imply that the electric current had decomposed ammonia, and\r\nthat the nitrogen had been determined towards the positive electrode. But\r\nwhen the electricity used was measured out by the volta-electrometer (707.\r\n736.), it was found that the hydrogen obtained was exactly in the\r\nproportion which would have been supplied by decomposed water, whilst the\r\nnitrogen had no certain or constant relation whatever. When, upon\r\nmultiplying experiments, it was found that, by using a stronger or weaker\r\nsolution, or a more or less powerful battery, the gas evolved at the\r\n_anode_ was a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, varying both in proportion\r\nand absolute quantity, whilst the hydrogen at the _cathode_ remained\r\nconstant, no doubt could be entertained that the nitrogen at the _anode_\r\nwas a secondary result, depending upon the chemical action of the nascent\r\noxygen, determined to that surface by the electric current, upon the\r\nammonia in solution. It was the water, therefore, which was electrolyzed,\r\nnot the ammonia. Further, the experiment gives no real indication of the\r\ntendency of the element nitrogen to either one electrode or the other; nor\r\ndo I know of any experiment with nitric acid, or other compounds of\r\nnitrogen, which shows the tendency of this element, under the influence of\r\nthe electric current, to pass in either direction along its course.\r\n\r\n749. As another illustration of secondary results, the effects on a\r\nsolution of acetate of potassa, may be quoted. When a very strong solution\r\nwas used, more gas was evolved at the _anode_ than at the _cathode_, in the\r\nproportion of 4 to 3 nearly: that from the _anode_ was a mixture of\r\ncarbonic oxide and carbonic acid; that from the _cathode_ pure hydrogen.\r\nWhen a much weaker solution was used, less gas was evolved at the _anode_\r\nthan at the _cathode_; and it now contained carburetted hydrogen, as well\r\nas carbonic oxide and carbonic acid. This result of carburetted hydrogen at\r\nthe positive electrode has a very anomalous appearance, if considered as an\r\nimmediate consequence of the decomposing power of the current. It, however,\r\nas well as the carbonic oxide and acid, is only a _secondary result_; for\r\nit is the water alone which suffers electro-decomposition, and it is the\r\noxygen eliminated at the _anode_ which, reacting on the acetic acid, in the\r\nmidst of which it is evolved, produces those substances that finally appear\r\nthere. This is fully proved by experiments with the volta-electrometer\r\n(707.); for then the hydrogen evolved from the acetate at the _cathode_ is\r\nalways found to be definite, being exactly proportionate to the electricity\r\nwhich has passed through the solution, and, in quantity, the same as the\r\nhydrogen evolved in the volta-electrometer itself. The appearance of the\r\ncarbon in combination with the hydrogen at the positive electrode, and its\r\nnon-appearance at the negative electrode, are in curious contrast with the\r\nresults which might have been expected from the law usually accepted\r\nrespecting the final places of the elements.\r\n\r\n750. If the salt in solution be an acetate of lead, then the results at\r\nboth electrodes are secondary, and cannot be used to estimate or express\r\nthe amount of electro-chemical action, except by a circuitous process\r\n(843.). In place of oxygen or even the gases already described (749.),\r\nperoxide of lead now appears at the positive, and lead itself at the\r\nnegative electrode. When other metallic solutions are used, containing, for\r\ninstance, peroxides, as that of copper, combined with this or any other\r\ndecomposable acid, still more complicated results will be obtained; which,\r\nviewed as direct results of the electro-chemical action, will, in their\r\nproportions, present nothing but confusion, but will appear perfectly\r\nharmonious and simple if they be considered as secondary results, and will\r\naccord in their proportions with the oxygen and hydrogen evolved from water\r\nby the action of a definite quantity of electricity.\r\n\r\n751. I have experimented upon many bodies, with a view to determine whether\r\nthe results were primary or secondary. I have been surprised to find how\r\nmany of them, in ordinary cases, are of the latter class, and how\r\nfrequently water is the only body electrolyzed in instances where other\r\nsubstances have been supposed to give way. Some of these results I will\r\ngive in as few words as possible.\r\n\r\n752. _Nitric acid._--When very strong, it conducted well, and yielded\r\noxygen at the positive electrode. No gas appeared at the negative\r\nelectrode; but nitrous acid, and apparently nitric oxide, were formed\r\nthere, which, dissolving, rendered the acid yellow or red, and at last even\r\neffervescent, from the spontaneous separation of nitric oxide. Upon\r\ndiluting the acid with its bulk or more of water, gas appeared at the\r\nnegative electrode. Its quantity could be varied by variations, either in\r\nthe strength of the acid or of the voltaic current: for that acid from\r\nwhich no gas separated at the _cathode_, with a weak voltaic battery, did\r\nevolve gas there with a stronger; and that battery which evolved no gas\r\nthere with a strong acid, did cause its evolution with an acid more dilute.\r\nThe gas at the _anode_ was always oxygen; that at the _cathode_ hydrogen.\r\nWhen the quantity of products was examined by the volta-electrometer\r\n(707.), the oxygen, whether from strong or weak acid, proved to be in the\r\nsame proportion as from water. When the acid was diluted to specific\r\ngravity 1.24, or less, the hydrogen also proved to be the same in quantity\r\nas from water. Hence I conclude that the nitric acid does not undergo\r\nelectrolyzation, but the water only; that the oxygen at the _anode_ is\r\nalways a primary result, but that the products at the _cathode_ are often\r\nsecondary, and due to the reaction of the hydrogen upon the nitric acid.\r\n\r\n753. _Nitre._--A solution of this salt yields very variable results,\r\naccording as one or other form of tube is used, or as the electrodes are\r\nlarge or small. Sometimes the whole of the hydrogen of the water decomposed\r\nmay be obtained at the negative electrode; at other times, only a part of\r\nit, because of the ready formation of secondary results. The solution is a\r\nvery excellent conductor of electricity.\r\n\r\n754. _Nitrate of ammonia_, in aqueous solution, gives rise to secondary\r\nresults very varied and uncertain in their proportions.\r\n\r\n755. _Sulphurous acid._--Pure liquid sulphurous acid does not conduct nor\r\nsuffer decomposition by the voltaic current[A], but, when dissolved in\r\nwater, the solution acquires conducting power, and is decomposed, yielding\r\noxygen at the _anode_, and hydrogen and sulphur at the _cathode_.\r\n\r\n  [A] See also De la Rive, Bibliothèque Universelle, tom. xl. p. 205; or\r\n  Quarterly Journal of Science, vol. xxvii. p, 407.\r\n\r\n756. A solution containing sulphuric acid in addition to the sulphurous\r\nacid, was a better conductor. It gave very little gas at either electrode:\r\nthat at the _anode_ was oxygen, that at the _cathode_ pure hydrogen. From\r\nthe _cathode_ also rose a white turbid stream, consisting of diffused\r\nsulphur, which soon rendered the whole solution milky. The volumes of gases\r\nwere in no regular proportion to the quantities evolved from water in the\r\nvoltameter. I conclude that the sulphurous acid was not at all affected by\r\nthe electric current in any of these cases, and that the water present was\r\nthe only body electro-chemically decomposed; that, at the _anode_, the\r\noxygen from the water converted the sulphurous acid into sulphuric acid,\r\nand, at the _cathode_, the hydrogen electrically evolved decomposed the\r\nsulphurous acid, combining with its oxygen, and setting its sulphur free. I\r\nconclude that the sulphur at the negative electrode was only a secondary\r\nresult; and, in fact, no part of it was found combined with the small\r\nportion of hydrogen which escaped when weak solutions of sulphurous acid\r\nwere used.\r\n\r\n757. _Sulphuric acid._--I have already given my reasons for concluding that\r\nsulphuric acid is not electrolyzable, i.e. not decomposable directly by the\r\nelectric current, but occasionally suffering by a secondary action at the\r\n_cathode_ from the hydrogen evolved there (681.). In the year 1800, Davy\r\nconsidered the sulphur from sulphuric acid as the result of the action of\r\nthe nascent hydrogen[A]. In 1804, Hisinger and Berzelius stated that it was\r\nthe direct result of the action of the voltaic pile[B], an opinion which\r\nfrom that time Davy seems to have adopted, and which has since been\r\ncommonly received by all. The change of my own opinion requires that I\r\nshould correct what I have already said of the decomposition of sulphuric\r\nacid in a former series of these Researches (552.): I do not now think that\r\nthe appearance of the sulphur at the negative electrode is an immediate\r\nconsequence of electrolytic action.\r\n\r\n  [A] Nicholson's Quarterly Journal, vol. iv. pp. 280, 281.\r\n\r\n  [B] Annales de Chimie, 1804, tom. li. p. 173.\r\n\r\n758. _Muriatic acid._--A strong solution gave hydrogen at the negative\r\nelectrode, and chlorine only at the positive electrode; of the latter, a\r\npart acted on the platina and a part was dissolved. A minute bubble of gas\r\nremained; it was not oxygen, but probably air previously held in solution.\r\n\r\n759. It was an important matter to determine whether the chlorine was a\r\nprimary result, or only a secondary product, due to the action of the\r\noxygen evolved from water at the _anode_ upon the muriatic acid; i.e.\r\nwhether the muriatic acid was electrolyzable, and if so, whether the\r\ndecomposition was _definite_.\r\n\r\n760. The muriatic acid was gradually diluted. One part with six of water\r\ngave only chlorine at the _anode_. One part with eight of water gave only\r\nchlorine; with nine of water, a little oxygen appeared with the chlorine;\r\nbut the occurrence or non-occurrence of oxygen at these strengths depended,\r\nin part, on the strength of the voltaic battery used. With fifteen parts of\r\nwater, a little oxygen, with much chlorine, was evolved at the _anode_. As\r\nthe solution was now becoming a bad conductor of electricity, sulphuric\r\nacid was added to it: this caused more ready decomposition, but did not\r\nsensibly alter the proportion of chlorine and oxygen.\r\n\r\n761. The muriatic acid was now diluted with 100 times its volume of dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. It still gave a large proportion of chlorine at the\r\n_anode_, mingled with oxygen; and the result was the same, whether a\r\nvoltaic battery of 40 pairs of plates or one containing only 5 pairs were\r\nused. With acid of this strength, the oxygen evolved at the _anode_ was to\r\nthe hydrogen at the _cathode_, in volume, as 17 is to 64; and therefore the\r\nchlorine would have been 30 volumes, had it not been dissolved by the\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\n762. Next with respect to the quantity of elements evolved. On using the\r\nvolta-electrometer, it was found that, whether the strongest or the weakest\r\nmuriatic acid were used, whether chlorine alone or chlorine mingled with\r\noxygen appeared at the _anode_, still the hydrogen evolved at the _cathode_\r\nwas a constant quantity, i.e. exactly the same as the hydrogen which the\r\n_same quantity of electricity_ could evolve from water.\r\n\r\n763. This constancy does not decide whether the muriatic acid is\r\nelectrolyzed or not, although it proves that if so, it must be in definite\r\nproportions to the quantity of electricity used. Other considerations may,\r\nhowever, be allowed to decide the point. The analogy between chlorine and\r\noxygen, in their relations to hydrogen, is so strong, as to lead almost to\r\nthe certainty, that, when combined with that element, they would perform\r\nsimilar parts in the process of electro-decomposition. They both unite with\r\nit in single proportional or equivalent quantities; and the number of\r\nproportionals appearing to have an intimate and important relation to the\r\ndecomposability of a body (697.), those in muriatic acid, as well as in\r\nwater, are the most favourable, or those perhaps even necessary, to\r\ndecomposition. In other binary compounds of chlorine also, where nothing\r\nequivocal depending on the simultaneous presence of it and oxygen is\r\ninvolved, the chlorine is directly eliminated at the _anode_ by the\r\nelectric current. Such is the case with the chloride of lead (395.), which\r\nmay be justly compared with protoxide of lead (402.), and stands in the\r\nsame relation to it as muriatic acid to water. The chlorides of potassium,\r\nsodium, barium, &c., are in the same relation to the protoxides of the same\r\nmetals and present the same results under the influence of the electric\r\ncurrent (402.).\r\n\r\n764. From all the experiments, combined with these considerations, I\r\nconclude that muriatic acid is decomposed by the direct influence of the\r\nelectric current, and that the quantities evolved are, and therefore the\r\nchemical action is, _definite for a definite quantity of electricity_. For\r\nthough I have not collected and measured the chlorine, in its separate\r\nstate, at the _anode_, there can exist no doubt as to its being\r\nproportional to the hydrogen at the _cathode_; and the results are\r\ntherefore sufficient to establish the general law of _constant\r\nelectro-chemical action_ in the case of muriatic acid.\r\n\r\n765. In the dilute acid (761.), I conclude that a part of the water is\r\nelectro-chemically decomposed, giving origin to the oxygen, which appears\r\nmingled with the chlorine at the _anode_. The oxygen _may_ be viewed as a\r\nsecondary result; but I incline to believe that it is not so; for, if it\r\nwere, it might be expected in largest proportion from the stronger acid,\r\nwhereas the reverse is the fact. This consideration, with others, also\r\nleads me to conclude that muriatic acid is more easily decomposed by the\r\nelectric current than water; since, even when diluted with eight or nine\r\ntimes its quantity of the latter fluid, it alone gives way, the water\r\nremaining unaffected.\r\n\r\n766. _Chlorides._--On using solutions of chlorides in water,--for instance,\r\nthe chlorides of sodium or calcium,--there was evolution of chlorine only\r\nat the positive electrode, and of hydrogen, with the oxide of the base, as\r\nsoda or lime, at the negative electrode. The process of decomposition may\r\nbe viewed as proceeding in two or three ways, all terminating in the same\r\nresults. Perhaps the simplest is to consider the chloride as the substance\r\nelectrolyzed, its chlorine being determined to and evolved at the _anode_,\r\nand its metal passing to the _cathode_, where, finding no more chlorine, it\r\nacts upon the water, producing hydrogen and an oxide as secondary results.\r\nAs the discussion would detain me from more important matter, and is not of\r\nimmediate consequence, I shall defer it for the present. It is, however, of\r\n_great consequence_ to state, that, on using the volta-electrometer, the\r\nhydrogen in both cases was definite; and if the results do not prove the\r\ndefinite decomposition of chlorides, (which shall be proved\r\nelsewhere,--789. 794. 814.,) they are not in the slightest degree opposed\r\nto such a conclusion, and do support the _general law_.\r\n\r\n767. _Hydriodic acid._--A solution of hydriodic acid was affected exactly\r\nin the same manner as muriatic acid. When strong, hydrogen was evolved at\r\nthe negative electrode, in definite proportion to the quantity of\r\nelectricity which had passed, i.e. in the same proportion as was evolved by\r\nthe same current from water; and iodine without any oxygen was evolved at\r\nthe positive electrode. But when diluted, small quantities of oxygen\r\nappeared with the iodine at the _anode_, the proportion of hydrogen at the\r\n_cathode_ remaining undisturbed.\r\n\r\n768. I believe the decomposition of the hydriodic acid in this case to be\r\ndirect, for the reasons already given respecting muriatic acid (763. 764.).\r\n\r\n769. _Iodides._--A solution of iodide of potassium being subjected to the\r\nvoltaic current, iodine appeared at the positive electrode (without any\r\noxygen), and hydrogen with free alkali at the negative electrode. The same\r\nobservations as to the mode of decomposition are applicable here as were\r\nmade in relation to the chlorides when in solution (766.).\r\n\r\n770. _Hydro-fluoric acid and fluorides._--Solution of hydrofluoric acid did\r\nnot appear to be decomposed under the influence of the electric current: it\r\nwas the water which gave way apparently. The fused fluorides were\r\nelectrolysed (417.); but having during these actions obtained _fluorine_ in\r\nthe separate state, I think it better to refer to a future series of these\r\nResearches, in which I purpose giving a fuller account of the results than\r\nwould be consistent with propriety here[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] I have not obtained fluorine: my expectations, amounting to\r\n  conviction, passed away one by one when subjected to rigorous\r\n  examination; some very singular results were obtained; and to one of\r\n  these I refer at 1340.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n771. _Hydro-cyanic acid_ in solution conducts very badly. The definite\r\nproportion of hydrogen (equal to that from water) was set free at the\r\n_cathode_, whilst at the _anode_ a small quantity of oxygen was evolved and\r\napparently a solution of cyanogen formed. The action altogether\r\ncorresponded with that on a dilute muriatic or hydriodic acid. When the\r\nhydrocyanic acid was made a better conductor by sulphuric acid, the same\r\nresults occurred.\r\n\r\n_Cyanides._--With a solution of the cyanide of potassium, the result was\r\nprecisely the same as with a chloride or iodide. No oxygen was evolved at\r\nthe positive electrode, but a brown solution formed there. For the reasons\r\ngiven when speaking of the chlorides (766.), and because a fused cyanide of\r\npotassium evolves cyanogen at the positive electrode[A], I incline to\r\nbelieve that the cyanide in solution is _directly_ decomposed.\r\n\r\n  [A] It is a very remarkable thing to see carbon and nitrogen in this\r\n  case determined powerfully towards the positive surface of the voltaic\r\n  battery; but it is perfectly in harmony with the theory of\r\n  electro-chemical decomposition which I have advanced.\r\n\r\n772. _Ferro-cyanic acid_ and the _ferro-cyanides_, as also _sulpho-cyanic\r\nacid_ and the _sulpho-cyanides_, presented results corresponding with those\r\njust described (771.).\r\n\r\n773. _Acetic acid._--Glacial acetic acid, when fused (405.), is not\r\ndecomposed by, nor does it conduct, electricity. On adding a little water\r\nto it, still there were no signs of action; on adding more water, it acted\r\nslowly and about as pure water would do. Dilute sulphuric acid was added to\r\nit in order to make it a better conductor; then the definite proportion of\r\nhydrogen was evolved at the _cathode_, and a mixture of oxygen in very\r\ndeficient quantity, with carbonic acid, and a little carbonic oxide, at the\r\n_anode_. Hence it appears that acetic acid is not electrolyzable, but that\r\na portion of it is decomposed by the oxygen evolved at the _anode_,\r\nproducing secondary results, varying with the strength of the acid, the\r\nintensity of the current, and other circumstances.\r\n\r\n774. _Acetates._--One of these has been referred to already, as affording\r\nonly secondary results relative to the acetic acid (749.). With many of the\r\nmetallic acetates the results at both electrodes are secondary (746. 750.).\r\n\r\nAcetate of soda fused and anhydrous is directly decomposed, being, as I\r\nbelieve, a true electrolyte, and evolving soda and acetic acid at the\r\n_cathode_ and _anode_. These however have no sensible duration, but are\r\nimmediately resolved into other substances; charcoal, sodiuretted hydrogen,\r\n&c., being set free at the former, and, as far as I could judge under the\r\ncircumstances, acetic acid mingled with carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, &c.\r\nat the latter.\r\n\r\n775. _Tartaric acid._--Pure solution of tartaric acid is almost as bad a\r\nconductor as pure water. On adding sulphuric acid, it conducted well, the\r\nresults at the positive electrode being primary or secondary in different\r\nproportions, according to variations in the strength of the acid and the\r\npower of the electric current (752.). Alkaline tartrates gave a large\r\nproportion of secondary results at the positive electrode. The hydrogen at\r\nthe negative electrode remained constant unless certain triple metallic\r\nsalts were used.\r\n\r\n776. Solutions, of salts containing other vegetable acids, as the\r\nbenzoates; of sugar, gum, &c., dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid; of\r\nresin, albumen, &c., dissolved in alkalies, were in turn submitted to the\r\nelectrolytic power of the voltaic current. In all these cases, secondary\r\nresults to a greater or smaller extent were produced at the positive\r\nelectrode.\r\n\r\n777. In concluding this division of these Researches, it cannot but occur\r\nto the mind that the final result of the action of the electric current\r\nupon substances, placed between the electrodes, instead of being simple may\r\nbe very complicated. There are two modes by which these substances may be\r\ndecomposed, either by the direct force of the electric current, or by the\r\naction of bodies which that current may evolve. There are also two modes by\r\nwhich new compounds may be formed, i.e. by combination of the evolving\r\nsubstances whilst in their nascent state (658.), directly with the matter\r\nof the electrode; or else their combination with those bodies, which being\r\ncontained in, or associated with, the body suffering decomposition, are\r\nnecessarily present at the _anode_ and _cathode_. The complexity is\r\nrendered still greater by the circumstance that two or more of these\r\nactions may occur simultaneously, and also in variable proportions to each\r\nother. But it may in a great measure be resolved by attention to the\r\nprinciples already laid down (747.).\r\n\r\n778. When _aqueous_ solutions of bodies are used, secondary results are\r\nexceedingly frequent. Even when the water is not present in large quantity,\r\nbut is merely that of combination, still secondary results often ensue: for\r\ninstance, it is very possible that in Sir Humphry Davy's decomposition of\r\nthe hydrates of potassa and soda, a part of the potassium produced was the\r\nresult of a secondary action. Hence, also, a frequent cause for the\r\ndisappearance of the oxygen and hydrogen which would otherwise be evolved:\r\nand when hydrogen does _not_ appear at the _cathode_ in an _aqueous\r\nsolution_, it perhaps always indicates that a secondary action has taken\r\nplace there. No exception to this rule has as yet occurred to my\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n779. Secondary actions are _not confined to aqueous solutions_, or cases\r\nwhere water is present. For instance, various chlorides acted upon, when\r\nfused (402.), by platina electrodes, have the chlorine determined\r\nelectrically to the _anode_. In many cases, as with the chlorides of lead,\r\npotassium, barium, &c., the chlorine acts on the platina and forms a\r\ncompound with it, which dissolves; but when protochloride of tin is used,\r\nthe chlorine at the _anode_ does not act upon the platina, but upon the\r\nchloride already there, forming a perchloride which rises in vapour (790.\r\n804.). These are, therefore, instances of secondary actions of both kinds,\r\nproduced in bodies containing no water.\r\n\r\n780. The production of boron from fused borax (402. 417.) is also a case of\r\nsecondary action; for boracic acid is not decomposable by electricity\r\n(408.), and it was the sodium evolved at the _cathode_ which, re-acting on\r\nthe boracic acid around it, took oxygen from it and set boron free in the\r\nexperiments formerly described.\r\n\r\n781. Secondary actions have already, in the hands of M. Becquerel, produced\r\nmany interesting results in the formation of compounds; some of them new,\r\nothers imitations of those occurring naturally[A]. It is probable they may\r\nprove equally interesting in an opposite direction, i.e. as affording cases\r\nof analytic decomposition. Much information regarding the composition, and\r\nperhaps even the arrangement, of the particles of such bodies as the\r\nvegetable acids and alkalies, and organic compounds generally, will\r\nprobably be obtained by submitting them to the action of nascent oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, chlorine, &c. at the electrodes; and the action seems the more\r\npromising, because of the thorough command which we possess over attendant\r\ncircumstances, such as the strength of the current, the size of the\r\nelectrodes, the nature of the decomposing conductor, its strength, &c., all\r\nof which may be expected to have their corresponding influence upon the\r\nfinal result.\r\n\r\n782. It is to me a great satisfaction that the extreme variety of secondary\r\nresults has presented nothing opposed to the doctrine of a constant and\r\ndefinite electro-chemical action, to the particular consideration of which\r\nI shall now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ vii. _On the definite nature and extent of Electro-chemical\r\nDecomposition._\r\n\r\n783. In the third series of these Researches, after proving the identity of\r\nelectricities derived from different sources, and showing, by actual\r\nmeasurement, the extraordinary quantity of electricity evolved by a very\r\nfeeble voltaic arrangement (371. 376.), I announced a law, derived from\r\nexperiment, which seemed to me of the utmost importance to the science of\r\nelectricity in general, and that branch of it denominated electro-chemistry\r\nin particular. The law was expressed thus: _The chemical power of a current\r\nof electricity is in direct proportion to the absolute quantity of\r\nelectricity which passes_ (377.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, tom, xxxv. p. 113.\r\n\r\n784. In the further progress of the successive investigations, I have had\r\nfrequent occasion to refer to the same law, sometimes in circumstances\r\noffering powerful corroboration of its truth (456. 504. 505.); and the\r\npresent series already supplies numerous new cases in which it holds good\r\n(704. 722. 726. 732.). It is now my object to consider this great principle\r\nmore closely, and to develope some of the consequences to which it leads.\r\nThat the evidence for it may be the more distinct and applicable, I shall\r\nquote cases of decomposition subject to as few interferences from secondary\r\nresults as possible, effected upon bodies very simple, yet very definite in\r\ntheir nature.\r\n\r\n785. In the first place, I consider the law as so fully established with\r\nrespect to the decomposition of _water_, and under so many circumstances\r\nwhich might be supposed, if anything could, to exert an influence over it,\r\nthat I may be excused entering into further detail respecting that\r\nsubstance, or even summing up the results here (732.). I refer, therefore,\r\nto the whole of the subdivision of this series of Researches which contains\r\nthe account of the _volta-electrometer_ (704. &c.).\r\n\r\n786. In the next place, I also consider the law as established with respect\r\nto _muriatic acid_ by the experiments and reasoning already advanced, when\r\nspeaking of that substance, in the subdivision respecting primary and\r\nsecondary results (758. &c.).\r\n\r\n787. I consider the law as established also with regard to _hydriodic acid_\r\nby the experiments and considerations already advanced in the preceding\r\ndivision of this series of Researches (767. 768.).\r\n\r\n788. Without speaking with the same confidence, yet from the experiments\r\ndescribed, and many others not described, relating to hydro-fluoric,\r\nhydro-cyanic, ferro-cyanic, and sulpho-cyanic acids (770. 771. 772.), and\r\nfrom the close analogy which holds between these bodies and the hydracids\r\nof chlorine, iodine, bromine, &c., I consider these also as coming under\r\nsubjection to the law, and assisting to prove its truth.\r\n\r\n789. In the preceding cases, except the first, the water is believed to be\r\ninactive; but to avoid any ambiguity arising from its presence, I sought\r\nfor substances from which it should be absent altogether; and, taking\r\nadvantage of the law of conduction already developed (380. &c.), I soon\r\nfound abundance, amongst which _protochloride of tin_ was first subjected\r\nto decomposition in the following manner. A piece of platina wire had one\r\nextremity coiled up into a small knob, and, having been carefully weighed,\r\nwas sealed hermetically into a piece of bottle-glass tube, so that the knob\r\nshould be at the bottom of the tube within (fig. 68.). The tube was\r\nsuspended by a piece of platina wire, so that the heat of a spirit-lamp\r\ncould be applied to it. Recently fused protochloride of tin was introduced\r\nin sufficient quantity to occupy, when melted, about one-half of the tube;\r\nthe wire of the tube was connected with a volta-electrometer (711.), which\r\nwas itself connected with the negative end of a voltaic battery; and a\r\nplatina wire connected with the positive end of the same battery was dipped\r\ninto the fused chloride in the tube; being however so bent, that it could\r\nnot by any shake of the hand or apparatus touch the negative electrode at\r\nthe bottom of the vessel. The whole arrangement is delineated in fig. 69.\r\n\r\n790. Under these circumstances the chloride of tin was decomposed: the\r\nchlorine evolved at the positive electrode formed bichloride of tin (779.),\r\nwhich passed away in fumes, and the tin evolved at the negative electrode\r\ncombined with the platina, forming an alloy, fusible at the temperature to\r\nwhich the tube was subjected, and therefore never occasioning metallic\r\ncommunication through the decomposing chloride. When the experiment had\r\nbeen continued so long as to yield a reasonable quantity of gas in the\r\nvolta-electrometer, the battery connexion was broken, the positive\r\nelectrode removed, and the tube and remaining chloride allowed to cool.\r\nWhen cold, the tube was broken open, the rest of the chloride and the glass\r\nbeing easily separable from the platina wire and its button of alloy. The\r\nlatter when washed was then reweighed, and the increase gave the weight of\r\nthe tin reduced.\r\n\r\n791. I will give the particular results of one experiment, in illustration\r\nof the mode adopted in this and others, the results of which I shall have\r\noccasion to quote. The negative electrode weighed at first 20 grains; after\r\nthe experiment, it, with its button of alloy, weighed 23.2 grains. The tin\r\nevolved by the electric current at the _cathode_: weighed therefore 3.2\r\ngrains. The quantity of oxygen and hydrogen collected in the\r\nvolta-electrometer = 3.85 cubic inches. As 100 cubic inches of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, in the proportions to form water, may be considered as weighing\r\n12.92 grains, the 3.85 cubic inches would weigh 0.49742 of a grain; that\r\nbeing, therefore, the weight of water decomposed by the same electric\r\ncurrent as was able to decompose such weight of protochloride of tin as\r\ncould yield 3.2 grains of metal. Now 0.49742 : 3.2 :: 9 the equivalent of\r\nwater is to 57.9, which should therefore be the equivalent of tin, if the\r\nexperiment had been made without error, and if the electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition _is in this case also definite_. In some chemical works 58 is\r\ngiven as the chemical equivalent of tin, in others 57.9. Both are so near\r\nto the result of the experiment, and the experiment itself is so subject to\r\nslight causes of variation (as from the absorption of gas in the\r\nvolta-electrometer (716.), &c.), that the numbers leave little doubt of the\r\napplicability of the _law of definite action_ in this and all similar cases\r\nof electro-decomposition.\r\n\r\n792. It is not often I have obtained an accordance in numbers so near as\r\nthat I have just quoted. Four experiments were made on the protochloride of\r\ntin, the quantities of gas evolved in the volta-electrometer being from\r\n2.05 to 10.29 cubic inches. The average of the four experiments gave 58.53\r\nas the electro-chemical equivalent for tin.\r\n\r\n793. The chloride remaining after the experiment was pure protochloride of\r\ntin; and no one can doubt for a moment that the equivalent of chlorine had\r\nbeen evolved at the _anode_, and, having formed bichloride of tin as a\r\nsecondary result, had passed away.\r\n\r\n794. _Chloride of lead_ was experimented upon in a manner exactly similar,\r\nexcept that a change was made in the nature of the positive electrode; for\r\nas the chlorine evolved at the _anode_ forms no perchloride of lead, but\r\nacts directly upon the platina, it produces, if that metal be used, a\r\nsolution of chloride of platina in the chloride of lead; in consequence of\r\nwhich a portion of platina can pass to the _cathode_, and would then\r\nproduce a vitiated result. I therefore sought for, and found in plumbago,\r\nanother substance, which could be used safely as the positive electrode in\r\nsuch bodies as chlorides, iodides, &c.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine or iodine does not act upon it, but is evolved in the free\r\nstate; and the plumbago has no re-action, under the circumstances, upon the\r\nfused chloride or iodide in which it is plunged. Even if a few particles of\r\nplumbago should separate by the heat or the mechanical action of the\r\nevolved gas, they can do no harm in the chloride.\r\n\r\n795. The mean of three experiments gave the number of 100.85 as the\r\nequivalent for lead. The chemical equivalent is 103.5. The deficiency in my\r\nexperiments I attribute to the solution of part of the gas (716.) in the\r\nvolta-electrometer; but the results leave no doubt on my mind that both the\r\nlead and the chlorine are, in this case, evolved in _definite quantities_\r\nby the action of a given quantity of electricity (814. &c.).\r\n\r\n796. _Chloride of antimony._--It was in endeavouring to obtain the\r\nelectro-chemical equivalent of antimony from the chloride, that I found\r\nreasons for the statement I have made respecting the presence of water in\r\nit in an earlier part of these Researches (690. 693. &c.).\r\n\r\n797. I endeavoured to experiment upon the _oxide of lead_ obtained by\r\nfusion and ignition of the nitrate in a platina crucible, but found great\r\ndifficulty, from the high temperature required for perfect fusion, and the\r\npowerful fluxing qualities of the substance. Green-glass tubes repeatedly\r\nfailed. I at last fused the oxide in a small porcelain crucible, heated\r\nfully in a charcoal fire; and, as it is was essential that the evolution of\r\nthe lead at the _cathode_ should take place beneath the surface, the\r\nnegative electrode was guarded by a green-glass tube, fused around it in\r\nsuch a _manner as to expose only the knob of platina_ at the lower end\r\n(fig. 70.), so that it could be plunged beneath the surface, and thus\r\nexclude contact of air or oxygen with the lead reduced there. A platina\r\nwire was employed for the positive electrode, that metal not being subject\r\nto any action from the oxygen evolved against it. The arrangement is given\r\nin fig. 71.\r\n\r\n798. In an experiment of this kind the equivalent for the lead came out\r\n93.17, which is very much too small. This, I believe, was because of the\r\nsmall interval between the positive and negative electrodes in the oxide of\r\nlead; so that it was not unlikely that some of the froth and bubbles formed\r\nby the oxygen at the _anode_ should occasionally even touch the lead\r\nreduced at the _cathode_, and re-oxidize it. When I endeavoured to correct\r\nthis by having more litharge, the greater heat required to keep it all\r\nfluid caused a quicker action on the crucible, which was soon eaten\r\nthrough, and the experiment stopped.\r\n\r\n799. In one experiment of this kind I used borate of lead (408. 673.). It\r\nevolves lead, under the influence of the electric current, at the _anode_,\r\nand oxygen at the _cathode_; and as the boracic acid is not either directly\r\n(408.) or incidentally decomposed during the operation, I expected a result\r\ndependent on the oxide of lead. The borate is not so violent a flux as the\r\noxide, but it requires a higher temperature to make it quite liquid; and if\r\nnot very hot, the bubbles of oxygen cling to the positive electrode, and\r\nretard the transfer of electricity. The number for lead came out 101.29,\r\nwhich is so near to 103.5 as to show that the action of the current had\r\nbeen definite.\r\n\r\n800. _Oxide of bismuth._--I found this substance required too high a\r\ntemperature, and acted too powerfully as a flux, to allow of any experiment\r\nbeing made on it, without the application of more time and care than I\r\ncould give at present.\r\n\r\n801. The ordinary _protoxide of antimony_, which consists of one\r\nproportional of metal and one and a half of oxygen, was subjected to the\r\naction of the electric current in a green-glass tube (789.), surrounded by\r\na jacket of platina foil, and heated in a charcoal fire. The decomposition\r\nbegan and proceeded very well at first, apparently indicating, according to\r\nthe general law (679. 697.), that this substance was one containing such\r\nelements and in such proportions as made it amenable to the power of the\r\nelectric current. This effect I have already given reasons for supposing\r\nmay be due to the presence of a true protoxide, consisting of single\r\nproportionals (696. 693.). The action soon diminished, and finally ceased,\r\nbecause of the formation of a higher oxide of the metal at the positive\r\nelectrode. This compound, which was probably the peroxide, being infusible\r\nand insoluble in the protoxide, formed a crystalline crust around the\r\npositive electrode; and thus insulating it, prevented the transmission of\r\nthe electricity. Whether, if it had been fusible and still immiscible, it\r\nwould have decomposed, is doubtful, because of its departure from the\r\nrequired composition (697.). It was a very natural secondary product at the\r\npositive electrode (779.). On opening the tube it was found that a little\r\nantimony had been separated at the negative electrode; but the quantity was\r\ntoo small to allow of any quantitative result being obtained[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] This paragraph is subject to the corrective note now appended to\r\n  paragraph 696.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n802. _Iodide of lead._--This substance can be experimented with in tubes\r\nheated by a spirit-lamp (789.); but I obtained no good results from it,\r\nwhether I used positive electrodes of platina or plumbago. In two\r\nexperiments the numbers for the lead came out only 75.46 and 73.45, instead\r\nof 103.5. This I attribute to the formation of a periodide at the positive\r\nelectrode, which, dissolving in the mass of liquid iodide, came in contact\r\nwith the lead evolved at the negative electrode, and dissolved part of it,\r\nbecoming itself again protiodide. Such a periodide does exist; and it is\r\nvery rarely that the iodide of lead formed by precipitation, and\r\nwell-washed, can be fused without evolving much iodine, from the presence\r\nof this percompound; nor does crystallization from its hot aqueous solution\r\nfree it from this substance. Even when a little of the protiodide and\r\niodine are merely rubbed together in a mortar, a portion of the periodide\r\nis formed. And though it is decomposed by being fused and heated to dull\r\nredness for a few minutes, and the whole reduced to protiodide, yet that is\r\nnot at all opposed to the possibility, that a little of that which is\r\nformed in great excess of iodine at the _anode_, should be carried by the\r\nrapid currents in the liquid into contact with the _cathode_.\r\n\r\n803. This view of the result was strengthened by a third experiment, where\r\nthe space between the electrodes was increased to one third of an inch; for\r\nnow the interfering effects were much diminished, and the number of the\r\nlead came out 89.04; and it was fully confirmed by the results obtained in\r\nthe cases of _transfer_ to be immediately described (818.).\r\n\r\nThe experiments on iodide of lead therefore offer no exception to the\r\n_general law_ under consideration, but on the contrary may, from general\r\nconsiderations, be admitted as included in it.\r\n\r\n804. _Protiodide of tin._--This substance, when fused (402.), conducts and\r\nis decomposed by the electric current, tin is evolved at the _anode_, and\r\nperiodide of tin as a secondary result (779. 790.) at the _cathode_. The\r\ntemperature required for its fusion is too high to allow of the production\r\nof any results fit for weighing.\r\n\r\n805. _Iodide of potassium_ was subjected to electrolytic action in a tube,\r\nlike that in fig. 68. (789.). The negative electrode was a globule of lead,\r\nand I hoped in this way to retain the potassium, and obtain results that\r\ncould be weighed and compared with the volta-electrometer indication; but\r\nthe difficulties dependent upon the high temperature required, the action\r\nupon the glass, the fusibility of the platina induced by the presence of\r\nthe lead, and other circumstances, prevented me from procuring such\r\nresults. The iodide was decomposed with the evolution of iodine at the\r\n_anode_, and of potassium at the _cathode_, as in former cases.\r\n\r\n806. In some of these experiments several substances were placed in\r\nsuccession, and decomposed simultaneously by the same electric current:\r\nthus, protochloride of tin, chloride of lead, and water, were thus acted on\r\nat once. It is needless to say that the results were comparable, the tin,\r\nlead, chlorine, oxygen, and hydrogen evolved being _definite in quantity_\r\nand electro-chemical equivalents to each other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n807. Let us turn to another kind of proof of the _definite chemical action\r\nof electricity_. If any circumstances could be supposed to exert an\r\ninfluence over the quantity of the matters evolved during electrolytic\r\naction, one would expect them to be present when electrodes of different\r\nsubstances, and possessing very different chemical affinities for such\r\nmatters, were used. Platina has no power in dilute sulphuric acid of\r\ncombining with the oxygen at the _anode_, though the latter be evolved in\r\nthe nascent state against it. Copper, on the other hand, immediately unites\r\nwith the oxygen, as the electric current sets it free from the hydrogen;\r\nand zinc is not only able to combine with it, but can, without any help\r\nfrom the electricity, abstract it directly from the water, at the same time\r\nsetting torrents of hydrogen free. Yet in cases where these three\r\nsubstances were used as the positive electrodes in three similar portions\r\nof the same dilute sulphuric acid, specific gravity 1.336, precisely the\r\nsame quantity of water was decomposed by the electric current, and\r\nprecisely the same quantity of hydrogen set free at the _cathodes_ of the\r\nthree solutions.\r\n\r\n808. The experiment was made thus. Portions of the dilute sulphuric acid\r\nwere put into three basins. Three volta-electrometer tubes, of the form\r\nfigg. 60. 62. were filled with the same acid, and one inverted in each\r\nbasin (707.). A zinc plate, connected with the positive end of a voltaic\r\nbattery, was dipped into the first basin, forming the positive electrode\r\nthere, the hydrogen, which was abundantly evolved from it by the direct\r\naction of the acid, being allowed to escape. A copper plate, which dipped\r\ninto the acid of the second basin, was connected with the negative\r\nelectrode of the _first_ basin; and a platina plate, which dipped into the\r\nacid of the third basin, was connected with the negative electrode of the\r\n_second_ basin. The negative electrode of the third basin was connected\r\nwith a volta-electrometer (711.), and that with the negative end of the\r\nvoltaic battery.\r\n\r\n809. Immediately that the circuit was complete, the _electro-chemical\r\naction_ commenced in all the vessels. The hydrogen still rose in,\r\napparently, undiminished quantities from the positive zinc electrode in the\r\nfirst basin. No oxygen was evolved at the positive copper electrode in the\r\nsecond basin, but a sulphate of copper was formed there; whilst in the\r\nthird basin the positive platina electrode evolved pure oxygen gas, and was\r\nitself unaffected. But in _all_ the basins the hydrogen liberated at the\r\n_negative_ platina electrodes was the _same in quantity_, and the same with\r\nthe volume of hydrogen evolved in the volta-electrometer, showing that in\r\nall the vessels the current had decomposed an equal quantity of water. In\r\nthis trying case, therefore, the _chemical action of electricity_ proved to\r\nbe _perfectly definite_.\r\n\r\n810. A similar experiment was made with muriatic acid diluted with its bulk\r\nof water. The three positive electrodes were zinc, silver, and platina; the\r\nfirst being able to separate and combine with the chlorine _without_ the\r\naid of the current; the second combining with the chlorine only after the\r\ncurrent had set it free; and the third rejecting almost the whole of it.\r\nThe three negative electrodes were, as before, platina plates fixed within\r\nglass tubes. In this experiment, as in the former, the quantity of hydrogen\r\nevolved at the _cathodes_ was the same for all, and the same as the\r\nhydrogen evolved in the volta-electrometer. I have already given my reasons\r\nfor believing that in these experiments it is the muriatic acid which is\r\ndirectly decomposed by the electricity (764.); and the results prove that\r\nthe quantities so decomposed are _perfectly definite_ and proportionate to\r\nthe quantity of electricity which has passed.\r\n\r\n811. In this experiment the chloride of silver formed in the second basin\r\nretarded the passage of the current of electricity, by virtue of the law of\r\nconduction before described (394.), so that it had to be cleaned off four\r\nor five times during the course of the experiment; but this caused no\r\ndifference between the results of that vessel and the others.\r\n\r\n812. Charcoal was used as the positive electrode in both sulphuric and\r\nmuriatic acids (808. 810.); but this change produced no variation of the\r\nresults. A zinc positive electrode, in sulphate of soda or solution of\r\ncommon salt, gave the same constancy of operation.\r\n\r\n813. Experiments of a similar kind were then made with bodies altogether in\r\na different state, i.e. with _fused_ chlorides, iodides, &c. I have already\r\ndescribed an experiment with fused chloride of silver, in which the\r\nelectrodes were of metallic silver, the one rendered negative becoming\r\nincreased and lengthened by the addition of metal, whilst the other was\r\ndissolved and eaten away by its abstraction. This experiment was repeated,\r\ntwo weighed pieces of silver wire being used as the electrodes, and a\r\nvolta-electrometer included in the circuit. Great care was taken to\r\nwithdraw the negative electrodes so regularly and steadily that the\r\ncrystals of reduced silver should not form a _metallic_ communication\r\nbeneath the surface of the fused chloride. On concluding the experiment the\r\npositive electrode was re-weighed, and its loss ascertained. The mixture of\r\nchloride of silver, and metal, withdrawn in successive portions at the\r\nnegative electrode, was digested in solution of ammonia, to remove the\r\nchloride, and the metallic silver remaining also weighed: it was the\r\nreduction at the _cathode_, and exactly equalled the solution at the\r\n_anode_; and each portion was as nearly as possible the equivalent to the\r\nwater decomposed in the volta-electrometer.\r\n\r\n814. The infusible condition of the silver at the temperature used, and the\r\nlength and ramifying character of its crystals, render the above experiment\r\ndifficult to perform, and uncertain in its results. I therefore wrought\r\nwith chloride of lead, using a green-glass tube, formed as in fig. 72. A\r\nweighed platina wire was fused into the bottom of a small tube, as before\r\ndescribed (789.). The tube was then bent to an angle, at about half an inch\r\ndistance from the closed end; and the part between the angle and the\r\nextremity being softened, was forced upward, as in the figure, so as to\r\nform a bridge, or rather separation, producing two little depressions or\r\nbasins _a, b_, within the tube. This arrangement was suspended by a platina\r\nwire, as before, so that the heat of a spirit-lamp could be applied to it,\r\nsuch inclination being given to it as would allow all air to escape during\r\nthe fusion of the chloride of lead. A positive electrode was then provided,\r\nby bending up the end of a platina wire into a knot, and fusing about\r\ntwenty grains of metallic lead on to it, in a small closed tube of glass,\r\nwhich was afterwards broken away. Being so furnished, the wire with its\r\nlead was weighed, and the weight recorded.\r\n\r\n815. Chloride of lead was now introduced into the tube, and carefully\r\nfused. The leaded electrode was also introduced; after which the metal, at\r\nits extremity, soon melted. In this state of things the tube was filled up\r\nto _c_ with melted chloride of lead; the end of the electrode to be\r\nrendered negative was in the basin _b_, and the electrode of melted lead\r\nwas retained in the basin _a_, and, by connexion with the proper conducting\r\nwire of a voltaic battery, was rendered positive. A volta-electrometer was\r\nincluded in the circuit.\r\n\r\n816. Immediately upon the completion of the communication with the voltaic\r\nbattery, the current passed, and decomposition proceeded. No chlorine was\r\nevolved at the positive electrode; but as the fused chloride was\r\ntransparent, a button of alloy could be observed gradually forming and\r\nincreasing in size at _b_, whilst the lead at _a_ could also be seen\r\ngradually to diminish. After a time, the experiment was stopped; the tube\r\nallowed to cool, and broken open; the wires, with their buttons, cleaned\r\nand weighed; and their change in weight compared with the indication of the\r\nvolta-electrometer.\r\n\r\n817. In this experiment the positive electrode had lost just as much lead\r\nas the negative one had gained (795.), and the loss and gain were very\r\nnearly the equivalents of the water decomposed in the volta-electrometer,\r\ngiving for lead the number 101.5. It is therefore evident, in this\r\ninstance, that causing a _strong affinity_, or _no affinity_, for the\r\nsubstance evolved at the _anode_, to be active during the experiment\r\n(807.), produces no variation in the definite action of the electric\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\n818. A similar experiment was then made with iodide of lead, and in this\r\nmanner all confusion from the formation of a periodide avoided (803.). No\r\niodine was evolved during the whole action, and finally the loss of lead at\r\nthe _anode_ was the same as the gain at the _cathode_, the equivalent\r\nnumber, by comparison with the result in the volta-electrometer, being\r\n103.5.\r\n\r\n819. Then protochloride of tin was subjected to the electric current in the\r\nsame manner, using of course, a tin positive electrode. No bichloride of\r\ntin was now formed (779. 790.). On examining the two electrodes, the\r\npositive had lost precisely as much as the negative had gained; and by\r\ncomparison with the volta-electrometer, the number for tin came out 59.\r\n\r\n820. It is quite necessary in these and similar experiments to examine the\r\ninterior of the bulbs of alloy at the ends of the conducting wires; for\r\noccasionally, and especially with those which have been positive, they are\r\ncavernous, and contain portions of the chloride or iodide used, which must\r\nbe removed before the final weight is ascertained. This is more usually the\r\ncase with lead than tin.\r\n\r\n821. All these facts combine into, I think, an irresistible mass of\r\nevidence, proving the truth of the important proposition which I at first\r\nlaid down, namely, _that the chemical power of a current of electricity is\r\nin direct proportion to the absolute quantity of electricity which passes_\r\n(377. 783.). They prove, too, that this is not merely true with one\r\nsubstance, as water, but generally with all electrolytic bodies; and,\r\nfurther, that the results obtained with any _one substance_ do not merely\r\nagree amongst themselves, but also with those obtained from _other\r\nsubstances_, the whole combining together into _one series of definite\r\nelectro-chemical actions_ (505.). I do not mean to say that no exceptions\r\nwill appear: perhaps some may arise, especially amongst substances existing\r\nonly by weak affinity; but I do not expect that any will seriously disturb\r\nthe result announced. If, in the well-considered, well-examined, and, I may\r\nsurely say, well-ascertained doctrines of the definite nature of ordinary\r\nchemical affinity, such exceptions occur, as they do in abundance, yet,\r\nwithout being allowed to disturb our minds as to the general conclusion,\r\nthey ought also to be allowed if they should present themselves at this,\r\nthe opening of a new view of electro-chemical action; not being held up as\r\nobstructions to those who may be engaged in rendering that view more and\r\nmore perfect, but laid aside for a while, in hopes that their perfect and\r\nconsistent explanation will ultimately appear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n822. The doctrine of _definite electro-chemical action_ just laid down,\r\nand, I believe, established, leads to some new views of the relations and\r\nclassifications of bodies associated with or subject to this action. Some\r\nof these I shall proceed to consider.\r\n\r\n823. In the first place, compound bodies may be separated into two great\r\nclasses, namely, those which are decomposable by the electric current, and\r\nthose which are not: of the latter, some are conductors, others\r\nnon-conductors, of voltaic electricity[A]. The former do not depend for\r\ntheir decomposability upon the nature of their elements only; for, of the\r\nsame two elements, bodies may be formed, of which one shall belong to one\r\nclass and another to the other class; but probably on the proportions also\r\n(697.). It is further remarkable, that with very few, if any, exceptions\r\n(414. 691.), these decomposable bodies are exactly those governed by the\r\nremarkable law of conduction I have before described (694.); for that law\r\ndoes not extend to the many compound fusible substances that are excluded\r\nfrom this class. I propose to call bodies of this, the decomposable class,\r\n_Electrolytes_ (664.).\r\n\r\n  [A] I mean here by voltaic electricity, merely electricity from a most\r\n  abundant source, but having very small intensity.\r\n\r\n824. Then, again, the substances into which these divide, under the\r\ninfluence of the electric current, form an exceedingly important general\r\nclass. They are combining bodies; are directly associated with the\r\nfundamental parts of the doctrine of chemical affinity; and have each a\r\ndefinite proportion, in which they are always evolved during electrolytic\r\naction. I have proposed to call these bodies generally _ions_, or\r\nparticularly _anions_ and _cations_, according as they appear at the\r\n_anode_ or _cathode_ (665.); and the numbers representing the proportions\r\nin which they are evolved _electro-chemical equivalents_. Thus hydrogen,\r\noxygen, chlorine, iodine, lead, tin are _ions_; the three former are\r\n_anions_, the two metals are _cations_, and 1, 8, 3, 125, 104, 58, are\r\ntheir _electro-chemical equivalents_ nearly.\r\n\r\n825. A summary of certain points already ascertained respecting\r\n_electrolytes, ions_, and _electro-chemical equivalents_, may be given in\r\nthe following general form of propositions, without, I hope, including any\r\nserious error.\r\n\r\n826. i. A single _ion_, i.e. one not in combination with another, will have\r\nno tendency to pass to either of the electrodes, and will be perfectly\r\nindifferent to the passing current, unless it be itself a compound of more\r\nelementary _ions_, and so subject to actual decomposition. Upon this fact\r\nis founded much of the proof adduced in favour of the new theory of\r\nelectro-chemical decomposition, which I put forth in a former series of\r\nthese Researches (518. &c.).\r\n\r\n827. ii. If one _ion_ be combined in right proportions (697.) with another\r\nstrongly opposed to it in its ordinary chemical relations, i.e. if an\r\n_anion_ be combined with a _cation_, then both will travel, the one to the\r\n_anode_, the other to the _cathode_, of the decomposing body (530, 542.\r\n547.).\r\n\r\n828. iii. If, therefore, an _ion_ pass towards one of the electrodes,\r\nanother _ion_ must also be passing simultaneously to the other electrode,\r\nalthough, from secondary action, it may not make its appearance (743.).\r\n\r\n829. iv. A body decomposable directly by the electric current, i.e. an\r\n_electrolyte_, must consist of two _ions_, and must also render them up\r\nduring the act of decomposition.\r\n\r\n830. v. There is but one _electrolyte_ composed of the same two elementary\r\n_ions_; at least such appears to be the fact (697.), dependent upon a law,\r\nthat _only single electro-chemical equivalents of elementary ions can go to\r\nthe electrodes, and not multiples_.\r\n\r\n831. vi. A body not decomposable when alone, as boracic acid, is not\r\ndirectly decomposable by the electric current when in combination (780.).\r\nIt may act as an _ion_ going wholly to the _anode_ or _cathode_, but does\r\nnot yield up its elements, except occasionally by a secondary action.\r\nPerhaps it is superfluous for me to point out that this proposition has _no\r\nrelation_ to such cases as that of water, which, by the presence of other\r\nbodies, is rendered a better conductor of electricity, and _therefore_ is\r\nmore freely decomposed.\r\n\r\n832. vii. The nature of the substance of which the electrode is formed,\r\nprovided it be a conductor, causes no difference in the\r\nelectro-decomposition, either in kind or degree (807. 813.): but it\r\nseriously influences, by secondary action (714.), the state in which the\r\nfinally appear. Advantage may be taken of this principle in combining and\r\n_ions_ collecting such _ions_ as, if evolved in their _free_ state, would\r\nbe unmanageable[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] It will often happen that the electrodes used may be of such a\r\n  nature as, with the fluid in which they are immersed, to produce an\r\n  electric current, either according with or opposing that of the\r\n  voltaic arrangement used, and in this way, or by direct chemical\r\n  action, may sadly disturb the results. Still, in the midst of all\r\n  these confusing effects, the electric current, which actually passes\r\n  in any direction through the body suffering decomposition, will\r\n  produce its own definite electrolytic action.\r\n\r\n833. viii. A substance which, being used as the electrode, can combine with\r\nthe _ion_ evolved against it, is also, I believe, an _ion_, and combines,\r\nin such cases, in the quantity represented by its _electro-chemical\r\nequivalent_. All the experiments I have made agree with this view; and it\r\nseems to me, at present, to result as a necessary consequence. Whether, in\r\nthe secondary actions that take place, where the _ion_ acts, not upon the\r\nmatter of the electrode, but on that which is around it in the liquid\r\n(744.), the same consequence follows, will require more extended\r\ninvestigation to determine.\r\n\r\n834. ix. Compound _ions_ are not necessarily composed of electro-chemical\r\nequivalents of simple _ions_. For instance, sulphuric acid, boracic acid,\r\nphosphoric acid, are _ions_, but not _electrolytes_, i.e. not composed of\r\nelectro-chemical equivalents of simple _ions_.\r\n\r\n835. x. Electro-chemical equivalents are always consistent; i.e. the same\r\nnumber which represents the equivalent of a substance A when it is\r\nseparating from a substance B, will also represent A when separating from a\r\nthird substance C. Thus, 8 is the electro-chemical equivalent of oxygen,\r\nwhether separating from hydrogen, or tin, or lead; and 103.5 is the\r\nelectrochemical equivalent of lead, whether separating from oxygen, or\r\nchlorine, or iodine.\r\n\r\n836. xi. Electro-chemical equivalents coincide, and are the same, with\r\nordinary chemical equivalents.\r\n\r\n837. By means of experiment and the preceding propositions, a knowledge of\r\n_ions_ and their electro-chemical equivalents may be obtained in various\r\nways.\r\n\r\n838. In the first place, they may be determined directly, as has been done\r\nwith hydrogen, oxygen, lead, and tin, in the numerous experiments already\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\n839. In the next place, from propositions ii. and iii., may be deduced the\r\nknowledge of many other _ions_, and also their equivalents. When chloride\r\nof lead was decomposed, platina being used for both electrodes (395.),\r\nthere could remain no more doubt that chlorine was passing to the _anode_,\r\nalthough it combined with the platina there, than when the positive\r\nelectrode, being of plumbago (794.), allowed its evolution in the free\r\nstate; neither could there, in either case, remain any doubt that for every\r\n103.5 parts of lead evolved at the _cathode_, 36 parts of chlorine were\r\nevolved at the _anode_, for the remaining chloride of lead was unchanged.\r\nSo also, when in a metallic solution one volume of oxygen, or a secondary\r\ncompound containing that proportion, appeared at the _anode_, no doubt\r\ncould arise that hydrogen, equivalent to two volumes, had been determined\r\nto the _cathode_, although, by a secondary action, it had been employed in\r\nreducing oxides of lead, copper, or other metals, to the metallic state. In\r\nthis manner, then, we learn from the experiments already described in these\r\nResearches, that chlorine, iodine, bromine, fluorine, calcium, potassium,\r\nstrontium, magnesium, manganese, &c., are _ions_ and that their\r\n_electro-chemical equivalents_ are the same as their _ordinary chemical\r\nequivalents_.\r\n\r\n840. Propositions iv. and v. extend our means of gaining information. For\r\nif a body of known chemical composition is found to be decomposable, and\r\nthe nature of the substance evolved as a primary or even a secondary result\r\n(743. 777.) at one of the electrodes, be ascertained, the electro-chemical\r\nequivalent of that body may be deduced from the known constant composition\r\nof the substance evolved. Thus, when fused protiodide of tin is decomposed\r\nby the voltaic current (804.), the conclusion may be drawn, that both the\r\niodine and tin are _ions_, and that the proportions in which they combine\r\nin the fused compound express their electro-chemical equivalents. Again,\r\nwith respect to the fused iodide of potassium (805.), it is an electrolyte;\r\nand the chemical equivalents will also be the electro-chemical equivalents.\r\n\r\n841. If proposition viii. sustain extensive experimental investigation,\r\nthen it will not only help to confirm the results obtained by the use of\r\nthe other propositions, but will give abundant original information of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n842. In many instances, the _secondary results_ obtained by the action of\r\nthe evolved _ion_ on the substances present in the surrounding liquid or\r\nsolution, will give the electro-chemical equivalent. Thus, in the solution\r\nof acetate of lead, and, as far as I have gone, in other proto-salts\r\nsubjected to the reducing action of the nascent hydrogen at the _cathode_,\r\nthe metal precipitated has been in the same quantity as if it had been a\r\nprimary product, (provided no free hydrogen escaped there,) and therefore\r\ngave accurately the number representing its electro-chemical equivalent.\r\n\r\n843. Upon this principle it is that secondary results may occasionally be\r\nused as measurers of the volta-electric current (706. 740.); but there are\r\nnot many metallic solutions that answer this purpose well: for unless the\r\nmetal is easily precipitated, hydrogen will be evolved at the _cathode_ and\r\nvitiate the result. If a soluble peroxide is formed at the _anode_, or if\r\nthe precipitated metal crystallize across the solution and touch the\r\npositive electrode, similar vitiated results are obtained. I expect to find\r\nin some salts, as the acetates of mercury and zinc, solutions favourable\r\nfor this use.\r\n\r\n844. After the first experimental investigations to establish the definite\r\nchemical action of electricity, I have not hesitated to apply the more\r\nstrict results of chemical analysis to correct the numbers obtained as\r\nelectrolytic results. This, it is evident, may be done in a great number of\r\ncases, without using too much liberty towards the due severity of\r\nscientific research. The series of numbers representing electro-chemical\r\nequivalents must, like those expressing the ordinary equivalents of\r\nchemically acting bodies, remain subject to the continual correction of\r\nexperiment and sound reasoning.\r\n\r\n845. I give the following brief Table of _ions_ and their electro-chemical\r\nequivalents, rather as a specimen of a first attempt than as anything that\r\ncan supply the want which must very quickly be felt, of a full and complete\r\ntabular account of this class of bodies. Looking forward to such a table as\r\nof extreme utility (if well-constructed) in developing the intimate\r\nrelation of ordinary chemical affinity to electrical actions, and\r\nidentifying the two, not to the imagination merely, but to the conviction\r\nof the senses and a sound judgement, I may be allowed to express a hope,\r\nthat the endeavour will always be to make it a table of _real_, and not\r\n_hypothetical_, electro-chemical equivalents; for we shall else overrun the\r\nfacts, and lose all sight and consciousness of the knowledge lying directly\r\nin our path.\r\n\r\n846. The equivalent numbers do not profess to be exact, and are taken\r\nalmost entirely from the chemical results of other philosophers in whom I\r\ncould repose more confidence, as to these points, than in myself.\r\n\r\n847.

This Table might be further arrange into groups of such substances as\r\neither act with, or replace, each other. Thus, for instance, acids and\r\nbases act in relation to each other; but they do not act in association\r\nwith oxygen, hydrogen, or elementary substances. There is indeed little or\r\nno doubt that, when the electrical relations of the particles of matter\r\ncome to be closely examined, this division must be made. The simple\r\nsubstances, with cyanogen, sulpho-cyanogen, and one or two other compound\r\nbodies, will probably form the first group; and the acids and bases, with\r\nsuch analogous compounds as may prove to be _ions_, the second group.\r\nWhether these will include all _ions_, or whether a third class of more\r\ncomplicated results will be required, must be decided by future\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n849. It is _probable_ that all our present elementary bodies are _ions_,\r\nbut that is not as yet certain. There are some, such as carbon, phosphorus,\r\nnitrogen, silicon, boron, alumium, the right of which to the title of _ion_\r\nit is desirable to decide as soon as possible. There are also many compound\r\nbodies, and amongst them alumina and silica, which it is desirable to class\r\nimmediately by unexceptionable experiments. It is also _possible_, that all\r\ncombinable bodies, compound as well as simple, may enter into the class of\r\n_ions_; but at present it does not seem to me probable. Still the\r\nexperimental evidence I have is so small in proportion to what must\r\ngradually accumulate around, and bear upon, this point, that I am afraid to\r\ngive a strong opinion upon it.\r\n\r\n850. I think I cannot deceive myself in considering the doctrine of\r\ndefinite electro-chemical action as of the utmost importance. It touches by\r\nits facts more directly and closely than any former fact, or set of facts,\r\nhave done, upon the beautiful idea, that ordinary chemical affinity is a\r\nmere consequence of the electrical attractions of the particles of\r\ndifferent kinds of matter; and it will probably lead us to the means by\r\nwhich we may enlighten that which is at present so obscure, and either\r\nfully demonstrate the truth of the idea, or develope that which ought to\r\nreplace it.\r\n\r\n851. A very valuable use of electro-chemical equivalents will be to decide,\r\nin cases of doubt, what is the true chemical equivalent, or definite\r\nproportional, or atomic number of a body; for I have such conviction that\r\nthe power which governs electro-decomposition and ordinary chemical\r\nattractions is the same; and such confidence in the overruling influence of\r\nthose natural laws which render the former definite, as to feel no\r\nhesitation in believing that the latter must submit to them also. Such\r\nbeing the case, I can have, no doubt that, assuming hydrogen as 1, and\r\ndismissing small fractions for the simplicity of expression, the equivalent\r\nnumber or atomic weight of oxygen is 8, of chlorine 36, of bromine 78.4, of\r\nlead 103.5, of tin 59, &c., notwithstanding that a very high authority\r\ndoubles several of these numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. _On the absolute quantity of Electricity associated with the\r\nparticles or atoms of Matter._\r\n\r\n\r\n852. The theory of definite electrolytical or electro-chemical action\r\nappears to me to touch immediately upon the _absolute quantity_ of\r\nelectricity or electric power belonging to different bodies. It is\r\nimpossible, perhaps, to speak on this point without committing oneself\r\nbeyond what present facts will sustain; and yet it is equally impossible,\r\nand perhaps would be impolitic, not to reason upon the subject. Although we\r\nknow nothing of what an atom is, yet we cannot resist forming some idea of\r\na small particle, which represents it to the mind; and though we are in\r\nequal, if not greater, ignorance of electricity, so as to be unable to say\r\nwhether it is a particular matter or matters, or mere motion of ordinary\r\nmatter, or some third kind of power or agent, yet there is an immensity of\r\nfacts which justify us in believing that the atoms of matter are in some\r\nway endowed or associated with electrical powers, to which they owe their\r\nmost striking qualities, and amongst them their mutual chemical affinity.\r\nAs soon as we perceive, through the teaching of Dalton, that chemical\r\npowers are, however varied the circumstances in which they are exerted,\r\ndefinite for each body, we learn to estimate the relative degree of force\r\nwhich resides in such bodies: and when upon that knowledge comes the fact,\r\nthat the electricity, which we appear to be capable of loosening from its\r\nhabitation for a while, and conveying from place to place, _whilst it\r\nretains its chemical force_, can be measured out, and being so measured is\r\nfound to be _as definite in its action_ as any of _those portions_ which,\r\nremaining associated with the particles of matter, give them their\r\n_chemical relation_; we seem to have found the link which connects the\r\nproportion of that we have evolved to the proportion of that belonging to\r\nthe particles in their natural state.\r\n\r\n853. Now it is wonderful to observe how small a quantity of a compound body\r\nis decomposed by a certain portion of electricity. Let us, for instance,\r\nconsider this and a few other points in relation to water. _One grain_ of\r\nwater, acidulated to facilitate conduction, will require an electric\r\ncurrent to be continued for three minutes and three quarters of time to\r\neffect its decomposition, which current must be powerful enough to retain a\r\nplatina wire 1/104 of an inch in thickness[A], red-hot, in the air during\r\nthe whole time; and if interrupted anywhere by charcoal points, will\r\nproduce a very brilliant and constant star of light. If attention be paid\r\nto the instantaneous discharge of electricity of tension, as illustrated in\r\nthe beautiful experiments of Mr. Wheatstone[B], and to what I have said\r\nelsewhere on the relation of common and voltaic electricity (371. 375.), it\r\nwill not be too much to say that this necessary quantity of electricity is\r\nequal to a very powerful flash of lightning. Yet we have it under perfect\r\ncommand; can evolve, direct, and employ it at pleasure; and when it has\r\nperformed its full work of electrolyzation, it has only separated the\r\nelements of _a single grain of water_.\r\n\r\n  [A] I have not stated the length of wire used, because I find by\r\n  experiment, as would be expected in theory, that it is indifferent.\r\n  The same quantity of electricity which, passed in a given time, can\r\n  heat an inch of platina wire of a certain diameter red-hot, can also\r\n  heat a hundred, a thousand, or any length of the same wire to the same\r\n  degree, provided the cooling circumstances are the same for every part\r\n  in all cases. This I have proved by the volta-electrometer. I found\r\n  that whether half an inch or eight inches were retained at one\r\n  constant temperature of dull redness, equal quantities of water were\r\n  decomposed in equal times. When the half-inch was used, only the\r\n  centre portion of wire was ignited. A fine wire may even be used as a\r\n  rough but ready regulator of a voltaic current; for if it be made part\r\n  of the circuit, and the larger wires communicating with it be shifted\r\n  nearer to or further apart, so as to keep the portion of wire in the\r\n  circuit sensibly at the same temperature, the current passing through\r\n  it will be nearly uniform.\r\n\r\n  [B] Literary Gazette, 1833, March 1 and 8. Philosophical Magazine,\r\n  1833, p. 201. L'Institut, 1833, p.261.\r\n\r\n854. On the other hand, the relation between the conduction of the\r\nelectricity and the decomposition of the water is so close, that one cannot\r\ntake place without the other. If the water is altered only in that small\r\ndegree which consists in its having the solid instead of the fluid state,\r\nthe conduction is stopped, and the decomposition is stopped with it.\r\nWhether the conduction be considered as depending upon the decomposition,\r\nor not (443. 703.), still the relation of the two functions is equally\r\nintimate and inseparable.\r\n\r\n855. Considering this close and twofold relation, namely, that without\r\ndecomposition transmission of electricity does not occur; and, that for a\r\ngiven definite quantity of electricity passed, an equally definite and\r\nconstant quantity of water or other matter is decomposed; considering also\r\nthat the agent, which is electricity, is simply employed in overcoming\r\nelectrical powers in the body subjected to its action; it seems a probable,\r\nand almost a natural consequence, that the quantity which passes is the\r\n_equivalent_ of, and therefore equal to, that of the particles separated;\r\ni.e. that if the electrical power which holds the elements of a grain of\r\nwater in combination, or which makes a grain of oxygen and hydrogen in the\r\nright proportions unite into water when they are made to combine, could be\r\nthrown into the condition of _a current_, it would exactly equal the\r\ncurrent required for the separation of that grain of water into its\r\nelements again.\r\n\r\n856. This view of the subject gives an almost overwhelming idea of the\r\nextraordinary quantity or degree of electric power which naturally belongs\r\nto the particles of matter; but it is not inconsistent in the slightest\r\ndegree with the facts which can be brought to bear on this point. To\r\nillustrate this I must say a few words on the voltaic pile[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] By the term voltaic pile, I mean such apparatus or arrangement of\r\n  metals as up to this time have been called so, and which contain\r\n  water, brine, acids, or other aqueous solutions or decomposable\r\n  substances (476.), between their plates. Other kinds of electric\r\n  apparatus may be hereafter invented, and I hope to construct some not\r\n  belonging to the class of instruments discovered by Volta.\r\n\r\n857. Intending hereafter to apply the results given in this and the\r\npreceding series of Researches to a close investigation of the source of\r\nelectricity in the voltaic instrument, I have refrained from forming any\r\ndecided opinion on the subject; and without at all meaning to dismiss\r\nmetallic contact, or the contact of dissimilar substances, being\r\nconductors, but not metallic, as if they had nothing to do with the origin\r\nof the current,\r\n\r\nI still am fully of opinion with Davy, that it is at least continued by\r\nchemical action, and that the supply constituting the current is almost\r\nentirely from that source.\r\n\r\n858. Those bodies which, being interposed between the metals of the voltaic\r\npile, render it active, _are all of them electrolytes_ (476.); and it\r\ncannot but press upon the attention of every one engaged in considering\r\nthis subject, that in those bodies (so essential to the pile) decomposition\r\nand the transmission of a current are so intimately connected, that one\r\ncannot happen without the other. This I have shown abundantly in water, and\r\nnumerous other cases (402. 476.). If, then, a voltaic trough have its\r\nextremities connected by a body capable of being decomposed, as water, we\r\nshall have a continuous current through the apparatus; and whilst it\r\nremains in this state we may look at the part where the acid is acting upon\r\nthe plates, and that where the current is acting upon the water, as the\r\nreciprocals of each other. In both parts we have the two conditions\r\n_inseparable in such bodies as these_, namely, the passing of a current,\r\nand decomposition; and this is as true of the cells in the battery as of\r\nthe water cell; for no voltaic battery has as yet been constructed in which\r\nthe chemical action is only that of combination: _decomposition is always\r\nincluded_, and is, I believe, an essential chemical part.\r\n\r\n859. But the difference in the two parts of the connected battery, that is,\r\nthe decomposition or experimental cell, and the acting cells, is simply\r\nthis. In the former we urge the current through, but it, apparently of\r\nnecessity, is accompanied by decomposition: in the latter we cause\r\ndecompositions by ordinary chemical actions, (which are, however,\r\nthemselves electrical,) and, as a consequence, have the electrical current;\r\nand as the decomposition dependent upon the current is definite in the\r\nformer case, so is the current associated with the decomposition also\r\ndefinite in the latter (862. &c.).\r\n\r\n860. Let us apply this in support of what I have surmised respecting the\r\nenormous electric power of each particle or atom of matter (856.). I showed\r\nin a former series of these Researches on the relation by measure of common\r\nand voltaic electricity, that two wires, one of platina and one of zinc,\r\neach one-eighteenth of an inch in diameter, placed five-sixteenths of an\r\ninch apart, and immersed to the depth of five-eighths of an inch in acid,\r\nconsisting of one drop of oil of vitriol and four ounces of distilled water\r\nat a temperature of about 60° Fahr., and connected at the other extremities\r\nby a copper wire eighteen feet long, and one-eighteenth of an inch in\r\nthickness, yielded as much electricity in little more than three seconds of\r\ntime as a Leyden battery charged by thirty turns of a very large and\r\npowerful plate electric machine in full action (371.). This quantity,\r\nthough sufficient if passed at once through the head of a rat or cat to\r\nhave killed it, as by a flash of lightning, was evolved by the mutual\r\naction of so small a portion of the zinc wire and water in contact with it,\r\nthat the loss of weight sustained by either would be inappreciable by our\r\nmost delicate instruments; and as to the water which could be decomposed by\r\nthat current, it must have been insensible in quantity, for no trace of\r\nhydrogen appeared upon the surface of the platina during those three\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n861. What an enormous quantity of electricity, therefore, is required for\r\nthe decomposition of a single grain of water! We have already seen that it\r\nmust be in quantity sufficient to sustain a platina wire 1/104 of an inch\r\nin thickness, red-hot, in contact with the air, for three minutes and three\r\nquarters (853.), a quantity which is almost infinitely greater than that\r\nwhich could be evolved by the little standard voltaic arrangement to which\r\nI have just referred (860. 871.). I have endeavoured to make a comparison\r\nby the loss of weight of such a wire in a given time in such an acid,\r\naccording to a principle and experiment to be almost immediately described\r\n(862.); but the proportion is so high that I am almost afraid to mention\r\nit. It would appear that 800,000 such charges of the Leyden battery as I\r\nhave referred to above, would be necessary to supply electricity sufficient\r\nto decompose a single grain of water; or, if I am right, to equal the\r\nquantity of electricity which is naturally associated with the elements of\r\nthat grain of water, endowing them with their mutual chemical affinity.\r\n\r\n862. In further proof of this high electric condition of the particles of\r\nmatter, and the _identity as to quantity of that belonging to them with\r\nthat necessary for their separation_, I will describe an experiment of\r\ngreat simplicity but extreme beauty, when viewed in relation to the\r\nevolution of an electric current and its decomposing powers.\r\n\r\n863. A dilute sulphuric acid, made by adding about one part by measure of\r\noil of vitriol to thirty parts of water, will act energetically upon a\r\npiece of zinc plate in its ordinary and simple state: but, as Mr. Sturgeon\r\nhas shown[A], not at all, or scarcely so, if the surface of the metal has\r\nin the first instance been amalgamated; yet the amalgamated zinc will act\r\npowerfully with platina as an electromotor, hydrogen being evolved on the\r\nsurface of the latter metal, as the zinc is oxidized and dissolved. The\r\namalgamation is best effected by sprinkling a few drops of mercury upon the\r\nsurface of the zinc, the latter being moistened with the dilute acid, and\r\nrubbing with the fingers or two so as to extend the liquid metal over the\r\nwhole of the surface. Any mercury in excess, forming liquid drops upon the\r\nzinc, should be wiped off[B].\r\n\r\n  [A] Recent Experimental Researches, &c., 1830, p.74, &c.\r\n\r\n  [B] The experiment may be made with pure zinc, which, as chemists well\r\n  know, is but slightly acted upon by dilute sulphuric acid in\r\n  comparison with ordinary zinc, which during the action is subject to\r\n  an infinity of voltaic actions. See De la Rive on this subject,\r\n  Bibliothèque Universelle, 1830, p.391.\r\n\r\n864. Two plates of zinc thus amalgamated were dried and accurately weighed;\r\none, which we will call A, weighed 163.1 grains; the other, to be called B,\r\nweighed 148.3 grains. They were about five inches long, and 0.4 of an inch\r\nwide. An earthenware pneumatic trough was filled with dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, of the strength just described (863.), and a gas jar, also filled\r\nwith the acid, inverted in it[A]. A plate of platina of nearly the same\r\nlength, but about three times as wide as the zinc plates, was put up into\r\nthis jar. The zinc plate A was also introduced into the jar, and brought in\r\ncontact with the platina, and at the same moment the plate B was put into\r\nthe acid of the trough, but out of contact with other metallic matter.\r\n\r\n  [A] The acid was left during a night with a small piece of\r\n  unamalgamated zinc in it, for the purpose of evolving such air as\r\n  might be inclined to separate, and bringing the whole into a constant\r\n  state.\r\n\r\n865. Strong action immediately occurred in the jar upon the contact of the\r\nzinc and platina plates. Hydrogen gas rose from the platina, and was\r\ncollected in the jar, but no hydrogen or other gas rose from _either_ zinc\r\nplate. In about ten or twelve minutes, sufficient hydrogen having been\r\ncollected, the experiment was stopped; during its progress a few small\r\nbubbles had appeared upon plate B, but none upon plate A. The plates were\r\nwashed in distilled water, dried, and reweighed. Plate B weighed 148.3\r\ngrains, as before, having lost nothing by the direct chemical action of the\r\nacid. Plate A weighed 154.65 grains, 8.45 grains of it having been oxidized\r\nand dissolved during the experiment.\r\n\r\n866. The hydrogen gas was next transferred to a water-trough and measured;\r\nit amounted to 12.5 cubic inches, the temperature being 52°, and the\r\nbarometer 29.2 inches. This quantity, corrected for temperature, pressure,\r\nand moisture, becomes 12.15453 cubic inches of dry hydrogen at mean\r\ntemperature and pressure; which, increased by one half for the oxygen that\r\nmust have gone to the _anode_, i.e. to the zinc, gives 18.232 cubic inches\r\nas the quantity of oxygen and hydrogen evolved from the water decomposed by\r\nthe electric current. According to the estimate of the weight of the mixed\r\ngas before adopted (791.), this volume is equal to 2.3535544 grains, which\r\ntherefore is the weight of water decomposed; and this quantity is to 8.45,\r\nthe quantity of zinc oxidized, as 9 is to 32.31. Now taking 9 as the\r\nequivalent number of water, the number 32.5 is given as the equivalent\r\nnumber of zinc; a coincidence sufficiently near to show, what indeed could\r\nnot but happen, that for an equivalent of zinc oxidized an equivalent of\r\nwater must be decomposed[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] The experiment was repeated several times with the same results.\r\n\r\n867. But let us observe _how_ the water is decomposed. It is electrolyzed,\r\ni.e. is decomposed voltaically, and not in the ordinary manner (as to\r\nappearance) of chemical decompositions; for the oxygen appears at the\r\n_anode_ and the hydrogen at the _cathode_ of the body under decomposition,\r\nand these were in many parts of the experiment above an inch asunder.\r\nAgain, the ordinary chemical affinity was not enough under the\r\ncircumstances to effect the decomposition of the water, as was abundantly\r\nproved by the inaction on plate B; the voltaic current was essential. And\r\nto prevent any idea that the chemical affinity was almost sufficient to\r\ndecompose the water, and that a smaller current of electricity might, under\r\nthe circumstances, cause the hydrogen to pass to the _cathode_, I need only\r\nrefer to the results which I have given (807. 813.) to shew that the\r\nchemical action at the electrodes has not the slightest influence over the\r\n_quantities_ of water or other substances decomposed between them, but that\r\nthey are entirely dependent upon the quantity of electricity which passes.\r\n\r\n868. What, then, follows as a necessary consequence of the whole\r\nexperiment? Why, this: that the chemical action upon 32.31 parts, or one\r\nequivalent of zinc, in this simple voltaic circle, was able to evolve such\r\nquantity of electricity in the form of a current, as, passing through\r\nwater, should decompose 9 parts, or one equivalent of that substance: and\r\nconsidering the definite relations of electricity as developed in the\r\npreceding parts of the present paper, the results prove that the quantity\r\nof electricity which, being naturally associated with the particles of\r\nmatter, gives them their combining power, is able, when thrown into a\r\ncurrent, to separate those particles from their state of combination; or,\r\nin other words, that _the electricity which decomposes, and that which is\r\nevolved by the decomposition of a certain quantity of matter, are alike._\r\n\r\n869. The harmony which this theory of the definite evolution and the\r\nequivalent definite action of electricity introduces into the associated\r\ntheories of definite proportions and electrochemical affinity, is very\r\ngreat. According to it, the equivalent weights of bodies are simply those\r\nquantities of them which contain equal quantities of electricity, or have\r\nnaturally equal electric powers; it being the ELECTRICITY which\r\n_determines_ the equivalent number, _because_ it determines the combining\r\nforce. Or, if we adopt the atomic theory or phraseology, then the atoms of\r\nbodies which are equivalents to each other in their ordinary chemical\r\naction, have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with\r\nthem. But I must confess I am jealous of the term _atom_; for though it is\r\nvery easy to talk of atoms, it is very difficult to form a clear idea of\r\ntheir nature, especially when compound bodies are under consideration.\r\n\r\n870. I cannot refrain from recalling here the beautiful idea put forth, I\r\nbelieve, by Berzelius (703.) in his development of his views of the\r\nelectro-chemical theory of affinity, that the heat and light evolved during\r\ncases of powerful combination are the consequence of the electric discharge\r\nwhich is at the moment taking place. The idea is in perfect accordance with\r\nthe view I have taken of the _quantity_ of electricity associated with the\r\nparticles of matter.\r\n\r\n871. In this exposition of the law of the definite action of electricity,\r\nand its corresponding definite proportion in the particles of bodies, I do\r\nnot pretend to have brought, as yet, every case of chemical or\r\nelectro-chemical action under its dominion. There are numerous\r\nconsiderations of a theoretical nature, especially respecting the compound\r\nparticles of matter and the resulting electrical forces which they ought to\r\npossess, which I hope will gradually receive their development; and there\r\nare numerous experimental cases, as, for instance, those of compounds\r\nformed by weak affinities, the simultaneous decomposition of water and\r\nsalts, &c., which still require investigation. But whatever the results on\r\nthese and numerous other points may be, I do not believe that the facts\r\nwhich I have advanced, or even the general laws deduced from them, will\r\nsuffer any serious change; and they are of sufficient importance to justify\r\ntheir publication, though much may yet remain imperfect or undone. Indeed,\r\nit is the great beauty of our science, CHEMISTRY, that advancement in it,\r\nwhether in a degree great or small, instead of exhausting the subjects of\r\nresearch, opens the doors to further and more abundant knowledge,\r\noverflowing with beauty and utility, to those who will be at the easy\r\npersonal pains of undertaking its experimental investigation.\r\n\r\n872. The definite production of electricity (868.) in association with its\r\ndefinite action proves, I think, that the current of electricity in the\r\nvoltaic pile: is sustained by chemical decomposition, or rather by chemical\r\naction, and not by contact only. But here, as elsewhere (857.), I beg to\r\nreserve my opinion as to the real action of contact, not having yet been\r\nable to make up my mind as to whether it is an exciting cause of the\r\ncurrent, or merely necessary to allow of the conduction of electricity,\r\notherwise generated, from one metal to the other.\r\n\r\n873. But admitting that chemical action is the source of electricity, what\r\nan infinitely small fraction of that which is active do we obtain and\r\nemploy in our voltaic batteries! Zinc and platina wires, one-eighteenth of\r\nan inch in diameter and about half an inch long, dipped into dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, so weak that it is not sensibly sour to the tongue, or\r\nscarcely to our most delicate test-papers, will evolve more electricity in\r\none-twentieth of a minute (860.) than any man would willingly allow to pass\r\nthrough his body at once. The chemical action of a grain of water upon four\r\ngrains of zinc can evolve electricity equal in quantity to that of a\r\npowerful thunder-storm (868. 861.). Nor is it merely true that the quantity\r\nis active; it can be directed and made to perform its full equivalent duty\r\n(867. &c.). Is there not, then, great reason to hope and believe that, by a\r\ncloser _experimental_ investigation of the principles which govern the\r\ndevelopment and action of this subtile agent, we shall be able to increase\r\nthe power of our batteries, or invent new instruments which shall a\r\nthousandfold surpass in energy those which we at present possess?\r\n\r\n874. Here for a while I must leave the consideration of the _definite\r\nchemical action of electricity_. But before I dismiss this series of\r\nexperimental Researches, I would call to mind that, in a former series, I\r\nshowed the current of electricity was also _definite in its magnetic\r\naction_ (216. 366. 367. 376. 377.); and, though this result was not pursued\r\nto any extent, I have no doubt that the success which has attended the\r\ndevelopment of the chemical effects is not more than would accompany an\r\ninvestigation of the magnetic phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nDecember 31st, 1833._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§14. _On the Electricity of the Voltaic Pile; its source, quantity,\r\nintensity, and general characters._ ¶ i. _On simple Voltaic Circles._ ¶ ii.\r\n_On the intensity necessary for Electrolyzation._ ¶ iii. _On associated\r\nVoltaic Circles, or the Voltaic Battery._ ¶ iv. _On the resistance of an\r\nElectrolyte to Electrolytic action._ ¶ v. _General remarks on the active\r\nVoltaic Battery._\r\n\r\nReceived April 7,--Read June 5, 1831.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ i. _On simple Voltaic Circles._\r\n\r\n\r\n875. The great question of the source of electricity, in the voltaic pile\r\nhas engaged the attention of so many eminent philosophers, that a man of\r\nliberal mind and able to appreciate their powers would probably conclude,\r\nalthough he might not have studied the question, that the truth was\r\nsomewhere revealed. But if in pursuance of this impression he were induced\r\nto enter upon the work of collating results and conclusions, he would find\r\nsuch contradictory evidence, such equilibrium of opinion, such variation\r\nand combination of theory, as would leave him in complete doubt respecting\r\nwhat he should accept as the true interpretation of nature: he would be\r\nforced to take upon himself the labour of repeating and examining the\r\nfacts, and then use his own judgement on them in preference to that of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n876. This state of the subject must, to those who have made up their minds\r\non the matter, be my apology for entering upon its investigation. The views\r\nI have taken of the definite action of electricity in decomposing bodies\r\n(783.), and the identity of the power so used with the power to be overcome\r\n(855.), founded not on a mere opinion or general notion, but on facts\r\nwhich, being altogether new, were to my mind precise and conclusive, gave\r\nme, as I conceived, the power of examining the question with advantages not\r\nbefore possessed by any, and which might compensate, on my part, for the\r\nsuperior clearness and extent of intellect on theirs. Such are the\r\nconsiderations which have induced me to suppose I might help in deciding\r\nthe question, and be able to render assistance in that great service of\r\nremoving _doubtful knowledge_. Such knowledge is the early morning light of\r\nevery advancing science, and is essential to its development; but the man\r\nwho is engaged in dispelling that which is deceptive in it, and revealing\r\nmore clearly that which is true, is as useful in his place, and as\r\nnecessary to the general progress of the science, as he who first broke\r\nthrough the intellectual darkness, and opened a path into knowledge before\r\nunknown to man.\r\n\r\n877. The identity of the force constituting the voltaic current or\r\nelectrolytic agent, with that which holds the elements of electrolytes\r\ntogether (855.), or in other words with chemical affinity, seemed to\r\nindicate that the electricity of the pile itself was merely a mode of\r\nexertion, or exhibition, or existence of _true chemical action_, or rather\r\nof its cause; and I have consequently already said that I agree with those\r\nwho believe that the _supply_ of electricity is due to chemical powers\r\n(857.).\r\n\r\n878. But the great question of whether it is originally due to metallic\r\ncontact or to chemical action, i.e. whether it is the first or the second\r\nwhich _originates_ and determines the current, was to me still doubtful;\r\nand the beautiful and simple experiment with amalgamated zinc and platina,\r\nwhich I have described minutely as to its results (863, &c.), did not\r\ndecide the point; for in that experiment the chemical action does not take\r\nplace without the contact of the metals, and the metallic contact is\r\ninefficient without the chemical action. Hence either might be looked upon\r\nas the _determining_ cause of the current.\r\n\r\n879. I thought it essential to decide this question by the simplest\r\npossible forms of apparatus and experiment, that no fallacy might be\r\ninadvertently admitted. The well-known difficulty of effecting\r\ndecomposition by a single pair of plates, except in the fluid exciting them\r\ninto action (863.), seemed to throw insurmountable obstruction in the way\r\nof such experiments; but I remembered the easy decomposability of the\r\nsolution of iodide of potassium (316.), and seeing no theoretical reason,\r\nif metallic contact was not _essential_, why true electro-decomposition\r\nshould not be obtained without it, even in a single circuit, I persevered\r\nand succeeded.\r\n\r\n880. A plate of zinc, about eight inches long and half an inch wide, was\r\ncleaned and bent in the middle to a right angle, fig. 73 _a_, Plate VI. A\r\nplate of platina, about three inches long and half an inch wide, was\r\nfastened to a platina wire, and the latter bent as in the figure, _b_.\r\nThese two pieces of metal were arranged together as delineated, but as yet\r\nwithout the vessel _c_, and its contents, which consisted of dilute\r\nsulphuric acid mingled with a little nitric acid. At _x_ a piece of folded\r\nbibulous paper, moistened in a solution of iodide of potassium, was placed\r\non the zinc, and was pressed upon by the end of the platina wire. When\r\nunder these circumstances the plates were dipped into the acid of the\r\nvessel _c_, there was an immediate effect at _x_, the iodide being\r\ndecomposed, and iodine appearing at the _anode_ (663.), i.e. against the\r\nend of the platina wire.\r\n\r\n881. As long as the lower ends of the plates remained in the acid the\r\nelectric current continued, and the decomposition proceeded at _x_. On\r\nremoving the end of the wire from place to place on the paper, the effect\r\nwas evidently very powerful; and on placing a piece of turmeric paper\r\nbetween the white paper and zinc, both papers being moistened with the\r\nsolution of iodide of potassium, alkali was evolved at the _cathode_ (663.)\r\nagainst the zinc, in proportion to the evolution of iodine at the _anode_.\r\nHence the decomposition was perfectly polar, and decidedly dependent upon a\r\ncurrent of electricity passing from the zinc through the acid to the\r\nplatina in the vessel _c_, and back from the platina through the solution\r\nto the zinc at the paper _x_.\r\n\r\n882. That the decomposition at _x_ was a true electrolytic action, due to a\r\ncurrent determined by the state of things in the vessel _c_, and not\r\ndependent upon any mere direct chemical action of the zinc and platina on\r\nthe iodide, or even upon any _current_ which the solution of iodide might\r\nby its action on those metals tend to form at _x_, was shown, in the first\r\nplace, by removing the vessel _c_ and its acid from the plates, when all\r\ndecomposition at _x_ ceased, and in the next by connecting the metals,\r\neither in or out of the acid, together, when decomposition of the iodide at\r\n_x_ occurred, but in a _reverse order_; for now alkali appeared against the\r\nend of the platina wire, and the iodine passed to the zinc, the current\r\nbeing the contrary of what it was in the former instance, and produced\r\ndirectly by the difference of action of the solution in the paper on the\r\ntwo metals. The iodine of course _combined_ with the zinc.\r\n\r\n883. When this experiment was made with pieces of zinc amalgamated over the\r\nwhole surface (863.), the results were obtained with equal facility and in\r\nthe same direction, even when only dilute sulphuric acid was contained in\r\nthe vessel _c_ (fig. 73.). Whichsoever end of the zinc was immersed in the\r\nacid, still the effects were the same: so that if, for a moment, the\r\nmercury might be supposed to supply the metallic contact, the inversion of\r\nthe amalgamated piece destroys that objection. The use of _unamalgamated\r\nzinc_ (880.) removes all possibility of doubt[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] The following is a more striking mode of making the above\r\n  elementary experiment. Prepare a plate of zinc, ten or twelve inches\r\n  long and two inches wide, and clean it thoroughly: provide also two\r\n  discs of clean platina, about one inch and a half in diameter:--dip\r\n  three or four folds of bibulous paper into a strong solution of iodide\r\n  of potassium, place them on the clean zinc at one end of the plate,\r\n  and put on them one of the platina discs: finally dip similar folds of\r\n  paper or a piece of linen cloth into a mixture of equal parts nitric\r\n  acid and water, and place it at the other end of the zinc plate with\r\n  the second platina disc upon it. In this state of things no change at\r\n  the solution of the iodide will be perceptible; but if the two discs\r\n  be connected by a platina (or any other) wire for a second or two, and\r\n  then that over the iodide be raised, it will be found that the _whole_\r\n  of the surface beneath is deeply stained with _evolved iodine_.--_Dec.\r\n  1838._\r\n\r\n884 When, in pursuance of other views (930.), the vessel _c_ was made to\r\ncontain a solution of caustic potash in place of acid, still the same\r\nresults occurred. Decomposition of the iodide was effected freely, though\r\nthere was no metallic contact of dissimilar metals, and the current of\r\nelectricity was in the _same direction_ as when acid was used at the place\r\nof excitement.\r\n\r\n885. Even a solution of common salt in the glass _c_ could produce all\r\nthese effects.\r\n\r\n886. Having made a galvanometer with platina wires, and introduced it into\r\nthe course of the current between the platina plate and the place of\r\ndecomposition _x_, it was affected, giving indications of currents in the\r\nsame direction as those shown to exist by the chemical action.\r\n\r\n887. If we consider these results generally, they lead to very important\r\nconclusions. In the first place, they prove, in the most decisive manner,\r\nthat _metallic contact is not necessary for the production of the voltaic\r\ncurrent._ In the next place, they show a most extraordinary mutual relation\r\nof the chemical affinities of the fluid which _excites_ the current, and\r\nthe fluid which is _decomposed_ by it.\r\n\r\n888. For the purpose of simplifying the consideration, let us take the\r\nexperiment with amalgamated zinc. The metal so prepared exhibits no effect\r\nuntil the current can pass: it at the same time introduces no new action,\r\nbut merely removes an influence which is extraneous to those belonging\r\neither to the production or the effect of the electric current under\r\ninvestigation (1000.); an influence also which, when present, tends only to\r\nconfuse the results.\r\n\r\n889. Let two plates, one of amalgamated zinc and the other of platina, be\r\nplaced parallel to each other (fig. 74.), and introduce a drop of dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, _y_, between them at one end: there will be no sensible\r\nchemical action at that spot unless the two plates are connected somewhere\r\nelse, as at PZ, by a body capable of conducting electricity. If that body\r\nbe a metal or certain forms of carbon, then the current passes, and, as it\r\ncirculates through the fluid at _y_, decomposition ensues.\r\n\r\n890. Then remove the acid from _y_, and introduce a drop of the solution of\r\niodide of potassium at _x_ (fig. 75.). Exactly the same set of effects\r\noccur, except that when the metallic communication is made at PZ, the\r\nelectric current is in the opposite direction to what it was before, as is\r\nindicated by the arrows, which show the courses of the currents (667.).\r\n\r\n891. Now _both_ the solutions used are conductors, but the conduction in\r\nthem is essentially connected with decomposition (858.) in a certain\r\nconstant order, and therefore the appearance of the elements in certain\r\nplaces _shows_ in what direction a current has passed when the solutions\r\nare thus employed. Moreover, we find that when they are used at opposite\r\nends of the plates, as in the last two experiments (889. 890.), metallic\r\ncontact being allowed at the other extremities, the currents are in\r\nopposite directions. We have evidently, therefore, the power of opposing\r\nthe actions of the two fluids simultaneously to each other at the opposite\r\nends of the plates, using each one as a conductor for the discharge of the\r\ncurrent of electricity, which the other tends to generate; in fact,\r\nsubstituting them for metallic contact, and combining both experiments into\r\none (fig. 76.). Under these circumstances, there is an opposition of\r\nforces: the fluid, which brings into play the stronger set of chemical\r\naffinities for the zinc, (being the dilute acid,) overcomes the force of\r\nthe other, and determines the formation and direction of the electric\r\ncurrent; not merely making that current pass through the weaker liquid, but\r\nactually reversing the tendency which the elements of the latter have in\r\nrelation to the zinc and platina if not thus counteracted, and forcing them\r\nin the contrary direction to that they are inclined to follow, that its own\r\ncurrent may have free course. If the dominant action at _y_ be removed by\r\nmaking metallic contact there, then the liquid at _x_ resumes its power; or\r\nif the metals be not brought into contact at _y_ but the affinities of the\r\nsolution there weakened, whilst those active _x_ are strengthened, then the\r\nlatter gains the ascendency, and the decompositions are produced in a\r\ncontrary order.\r\n\r\n892. Before drawing a _final_ conclusion from this mutual dependence and\r\nstate of the chemical affinities of two distant portions of acting fluids\r\n(916.), I will proceed to examine more minutely the various circumstances\r\nunder which the re-action of the body suffering decomposition is rendered\r\nevident upon the action of the body, also undergoing decomposition, which\r\nproduces the voltaic current.\r\n\r\n893. The use of _metallic contact_ in a single pair of plates, and the\r\ncause of its great superiority above contact made by other kinds of matter,\r\nbecome now very evident. When an amalgamated zinc plate is dipped into\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, the force of chemical affinity exerted between the\r\nmetal and the fluid is not sufficiently powerful to cause sensible action\r\nat the surfaces of contact, and occasion the decomposition of water by the\r\noxidation of the metal, although it _is_ sufficient to produce such a\r\ncondition of the electricity (or the power upon which chemical affinity\r\ndepends) as would produce a current if there were a path open for it (916.\r\n956.); and that current would complete the conditions necessary, under the\r\ncircumstances, for the decomposition of the water.\r\n\r\n894. Now the presence of a piece of platina touching both the zinc and the\r\nfluid to be decomposed, opens the path required for the electricity. Its\r\n_direct communication_ with the zinc is effectual, far beyond any\r\ncommunication made between it and that metal, (i.e. between the platina\r\nand zinc,) by means of decomposable conducting bodies, or, in other words,\r\n_electrolytes_, as in the experiment already described (891.); because,\r\nwhen _they_ are used, the chemical affinities between them and the zinc\r\nproduce a contrary and opposing action to that which is influential in the\r\ndilute sulphuric acid; or if that action be but small, still the affinity\r\nof their component parts for each other has to be overcome, for they cannot\r\nconduct without suffering decomposition; and this decomposition is found\r\n_experimentally_ to re-act back upon the forces which in the acid tend to\r\nproduce the current (904. 910. &c.), and in numerous cases entirely to\r\nneutralize them. Where direct contact of the zinc and platina occurs, these\r\nobstructing forces are not brought into action, and therefore the\r\nproduction and the circulation of the electric current and the concomitant\r\naction of decomposition are then highly favoured.\r\n\r\n895. It is evident, however, that one of these opposing actions may be\r\ndismissed, and yet an electrolyte be used for the purpose of completing the\r\ncircuit between the zinc and platina immersed separately into the dilute\r\nacid; for if, in fig. 73, the platina wire be retained in metallic contact\r\nwith the zinc plate _a_, at _x_, and a division of the platina be made\r\nelsewhere, as at _s_, then the solution of iodide placed there, being in\r\ncontact with platina at both surfaces, exerts no chemical affinities for\r\nthat metal; or if it does, they are equal on both sides. Its power,\r\ntherefore, of forming a current in opposition to that dependent upon the\r\naction of the acid in the vessel _c_, is removed, and only its resistance\r\nto decomposition remains as the obstacle to be overcome by the affinities\r\nexerted in the dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n896. This becomes the condition of a single pair of active plates where\r\n_metallic contact_ is allowed. In such cases, only one set of opposing\r\naffinities are to be overcome by those which are dominant in the vessel\r\n_c_; whereas, when metallic contact is not allowed, two sets of opposing\r\naffinities must be conquered (894.).\r\n\r\n897. It has been considered a difficult, and by some an impossible thing,\r\nto decompose bodies by the current from a single pair of plates, even when\r\nit was so powerful as to heat bars of metal red-hot, as in the case of\r\nHare's calorimeter, arranged as a single voltaic circuit, or of Wollaston's\r\npowerful single pair of metals. This difficulty has arisen altogether from\r\nthe antagonism of the chemical affinity engaged in producing the current\r\nwith the chemical affinity to be overcome, and depends entirely upon their\r\nrelative intensity; for when the sum of forces in one has a certain degree\r\nof superiority over the sum of forces in the other, the former gain the\r\nascendency, determine the current, and overcome the latter so as to make\r\nthe substance exerting them yield up its elements in perfect accordance,\r\nboth as to direction and quantity, with the course of those which are\r\nexerting the most intense and dominant action.\r\n\r\n898. Water has generally been the substance, the decomposition of which has\r\nbeen sought for as a chemical test of the passage of an electric current.\r\nBut I now began to perceive a reason for its failure, and for a fact which\r\nI had observed long before (315. 316.) with regard to the iodide of\r\npotassium, namely, that bodies would differ in facility of decomposition by\r\na given electric current, according to the condition and intensity of their\r\nordinary chemical affinities. This reason appeared in their _re-action upon\r\nthe affinities_ tending to cause the current; and it appeared probable,\r\nthat many substances might be found which could be decomposed by the\r\ncurrent of a single pair of zinc and platina plates immersed in dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, although water resisted its action. I soon found this to be\r\nthe case, and as the experiments offer new and beautiful proofs of the\r\ndirect relation and opposition of the chemical affinities concerned in\r\nproducing and in resisting the stream of electricity, I shall briefly\r\ndescribe them.\r\n\r\n899. The arrangement of the apparatus was as in fig. 77. The vessel _v_\r\ncontained dilute sulphuric acid; Z and P are the zinc and platina plates;\r\n_a_, _b_, and _c_ are platina wires; the decompositions were effected at\r\n_x_, and occasionally, indeed generally, a galvanometer was introduced into\r\nthe circuit at _g_: its place only is here given, the circle at _g_ having\r\nno reference to the size of the instrument. Various arrangements were made\r\nat _x_, according to the kind of decomposition to be effected. If a drop of\r\nliquid was to be acted upon, the two ends were merely dipped into it; if a\r\nsolution contained in the pores of paper was to be decomposed, one of the\r\nextremities was connected with a platina plate supporting the paper, whilst\r\nthe other extremity rested on the paper, _e_, fig. 81: or sometimes, as\r\nwith sulphate of soda, a plate of platina sustained two portions of paper,\r\none of the ends of the wires resting upon each piece, _c_, fig. 86. The\r\ndarts represent the direction of the electric current (667.).\r\n\r\n900. Solution of _iodide of potassium_, in moistened paper, being placed at\r\nthe interruption of the circuit at _x_, was readily decomposed. Iodine was\r\nevolved at the _anode_, and alkali at the _cathode_, of the decomposing\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n901. _Protochloride of tin_, when fused and placed at _x_, was also readily\r\ndecomposed, yielding perchloride of tin at the _anode_ (779.), and tin at\r\nthe _cathode_.\r\n\r\n902. Fused chloride of silver, placed at _x_, was also easily decomposed;\r\nchlorine was evolved at the _anode_, and brilliant metallic silver, either\r\nin films upon the surface of the liquid, or in crystals beneath, evolved at\r\nthe _cathode_.\r\n\r\n903. Water acidulated with sulphuric acid, solution of muriatic acid,\r\nsolution of sulphate of soda, fused nitre, and the fused chloride and\r\niodide of lead were not decomposed by this single pair of plates, excited\r\nonly by dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n904. These experiments give abundant proofs that a single pair of plates\r\ncan electrolyze bodies and separate their elements. They also show in a\r\nbeautiful manner the direct relation and opposition of the chemical\r\naffinities concerned at the two points of action. In those cases where the\r\nsum of the opposing affinities at _x_ was sufficiently beneath the sum of\r\nthe acting affinities in _v_, decomposition took place; but in those cases\r\nwhere they rose higher, decomposition was effectually resisted and the\r\ncurrent ceased to pass (891.).\r\n\r\n905. It is however, evident, that the sum of acting affinities in _v_ may\r\nbe increased by using other fluids than dilute sulphuric acid, in which\r\nlatter case, as I believe, it is merely the affinity of the zinc for the\r\noxygen already combined with hydrogen in the water that is exerted in\r\nproducing the electric current (919.): and when the affinities are so\r\nincreased, the view I am supporting leads to the conclusion, that bodies\r\nwhich resisted in the preceding experiments would then be decomposed,\r\nbecause of the increased difference between their affinities and the acting\r\naffinities thus exalted. This expectation was fully confirmed in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\n906. A little nitric acid was added to the liquid in the vessel _r_, so as\r\nto make a mixture which I shall call diluted nitro-sulphuric acid. On\r\nrepeating the experiments with this mixture, all the substances before\r\ndecomposed again gave way, and much more readily. But, besides that, many\r\nwhich before resisted electrolyzation, now yielded up their elements. Thus,\r\nsolution of sulphate of soda, acted upon in the interstices of litmus and\r\nturmeric paper, yielded acid at the _anode_ and alkali at the _cathode_;\r\nsolution of muriatic acid tinged by indigo yielded chlorine at the _anode_\r\nand hydrogen at the _cathode_; solution of nitrate of silver yielded silver\r\nat the _cathode_. Again, fused nitre and the fused iodide and chloride of\r\nlead were decomposable by the current of this single pair of plates, though\r\nthey were not by the former (903.).\r\n\r\n907. A solution of acetate of lead was apparently not decomposed by this\r\npair, nor did water acidulated by sulphuric acid seem at first to give way\r\n(973.).\r\n\r\n908. The increase of intensity or power of the current produced by a simple\r\nvoltaic circle, with the increase of the force of the chemical action at\r\nthe exciting place, is here sufficiently evident. But in order to place it\r\nin a clearer point of view, and to show that the decomposing effect was not\r\nat all dependent, in the latter cases, upon the mere capability of evolving\r\n_more_ electricity, experiments were made in which the quantity evolved\r\ncould be increased without variation in the intensity of the exciting\r\ncause. Thus the experiments in which dilute sulphuric acid was used (899.),\r\nwere repeated, using large plates of zinc and platina in the acid; but\r\nstill those bodies which resisted decomposition before, resisted it also\r\nunder these new circumstances. Then again, where nitro-sulphuric acid was\r\nused (906.), mere wires of platina and zinc were immersed in the exciting\r\nacid; yet, notwithstanding this change, those bodies were now decomposed\r\nwhich resisted any current tending to be formed by the dilute sulphuric\r\nacid. For instance, muriatic acid could not be decomposed by a single pair\r\nof plates when immersed in dilute sulphuric acid; nor did making the\r\nsolution of sulphuric acid strong, nor enlarging the size of the zinc and\r\nplatina plates immersed in it, increase the power; but if to a weak\r\nsulphuric acid a very little nitric acid was added, then the electricity\r\nevolved had power to decompose the muriatic acid, evolving chlorine at the\r\n_anode_ and hydrogen at the _cathode_, even when mere wires of metals were\r\nused. This mode of increasing the intensity of the electric current, as it\r\nexcludes the effect dependent upon many pairs of plates, or even the effect\r\nof making any one acid stronger or weaker, is at once referable to the\r\ncondition and force of the chemical affinities which are brought into\r\naction, and may, both in principle and practice, be considered as perfectly\r\ndistinct from any other mode.\r\n\r\n909. The direct reference which is thus experimentally made in the simple\r\nvoltaic circle of the _intensity_ of the electric current to the\r\n_intensity_ of the chemical action going on at the place where the\r\nexistence and direction of the current is determined, leads to the\r\nconclusion that by using selected bodies, as fused chlorides, salts,\r\nsolutions of acids, &c., which may act upon the metals employed with\r\ndifferent degrees of chemical force; and using also metals in association\r\nwith platina, or with each other, which shall differ in the degree of\r\nchemical action exerted between them and the exciting fluid or electrolyte,\r\nwe shall be able to obtain a series of comparatively constant effects due\r\nto electric currents of different intensities, which will serve to assist\r\nin the construction of a scale competent to supply the means of determining\r\nrelative degrees of intensity with accuracy in future researches[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In relation to this difference and its probable cause, see\r\n  considerations on inductive polarization, 1354, &c.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n910. I have already expressed the view which I take of the decomposition in\r\nthe experimental place, as being the direct consequence of the superior\r\nexertion at some other spot of the same kind of power as that to be\r\novercome, and therefore as the result of an antagonism of forces of the\r\n_same_ nature (891. 904.). Those at the place of decomposition have a\r\nre-action upon, and a power over, the exerting or determining set\r\nproportionate to what is needful to overcome their own power; and hence a\r\ncurious result of _resistance_ offered by decompositions to the original\r\ndetermining force, and consequently to the current. This is well shown in\r\nthe cases where such bodies as chloride of lead, iodide of lead, and water\r\nwould not decompose with the current produced by a single pair of zinc and\r\nplatina plates in sulphuric acid (903.), although they would with a current\r\nof higher intensity produced by stronger chemical powers. In such cases no\r\nsensible portion of the current passes (967.); the action is stopped; and I\r\nam now of opinion that in the case of the law of conduction which I\r\ndescribed in the Fourth Series of these Researches (413.), the bodies which\r\nare electrolytes in the fluid state cease to be such in the solid form,\r\nbecause the attractions of the particles by which they are retained in\r\ncombination and in their relative position, are then too powerful for the\r\nelectric current[A]. The particles retain their places; and as\r\ndecomposition is prevented, the transmission of the electricity is\r\nprevented also; and although a battery of many plates may be used, yet if\r\nit be of that perfect kind which allows of no extraneous or indirect action\r\n(1000.), the whole of the affinities concerned in the activity of that\r\nbattery are at the same time also suspended and counteracted.\r\n\r\n  [A] Refer onwards to 1705.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n911. But referring to the _resistance_ of each single case of\r\ndecomposition, it would appear that as these differ in force according to\r\nthe affinities by which the elements in the substance tend to retain their\r\nplaces, they also would supply cases constituting a series of degrees by\r\nwhich to measure the initial intensities of simple voltaic or other\r\ncurrents of electricity, and which, combined with the scale of intensities\r\ndetermined by different degrees of _acting force_ (909.), would probably\r\ninclude a sufficient set of differences to meet almost every important case\r\nwhere a reference to intensity would be required.\r\n\r\n912. According to the experiments I have already had occasion to make, I\r\nfind that the following bodies are electrolytic in the order in which I\r\nhave placed them, those which are first being decomposed by the current of\r\nlowest intensity. These currents were always from a single pair of plates,\r\nand may be considered as elementary _voltaic forces_.\r\n\r\nIodide of potassium (solution).\r\nChloride of silver (fused).\r\nProtochloride of tin (fused).\r\nChloride of lead (fused).\r\nIodide of lead (fused).\r\nMuriatic acid (solution).\r\nWater, acidulated with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n913. It is essential that, in all endeavours to obtain the relative\r\nelectrolytic intensity necessary for the decomposition of different bodies,\r\nattention should be paid to the nature of the electrodes and the other\r\nbodies present which may favour secondary actions (986.). If in\r\nelectro-decomposition one of the elements separated has an affinity for the\r\nelectrode, or for bodies present in the surrounding fluid, then the\r\naffinity resisting decomposition is in part balanced by such power, and the\r\ntrue place of the electrolyte in a table of the above kind is not obtained:\r\nthus, chlorine combines with a positive platina electrode freely, but\r\niodine scarcely at all, and therefore I believe it is that the fused\r\nchlorides stand first in the preceding Table. Again, if in the\r\ndecomposition of water not merely sulphuric but also a little nitric acid\r\nbe present, then the water is more freely decomposed, for the hydrogen at\r\nthe _cathode_ is not ultimately expelled, but finds oxygen in the nitric\r\nacid, with which it can combine to produce a secondary result; the\r\naffinities opposing decomposition are in this way diminished, and the\r\nelements of the water can then be separated by a current of lower\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n914. Advantage may be taken of this principle to interpolate more minute\r\ndegrees into the scale of initial intensities already referred to (909.\r\n911.) than is there spoken of; for by combining the force of a current\r\n_constant_ in its intensity, with the use of electrodes consisting of\r\nmatter, having more or less affinity for the elements evolved from the\r\ndecomposing electrolyte, various intermediate degrees may be obtained.\r\n\r\n        *        *        *        *        *\r\n\r\n915. Returning to the consideration of the source of electricity (878.\r\n&c.), there is another proof of the most perfect kind that metallic contact\r\nhas nothing to do with the _production_ of electricity in the voltaic\r\ncircuit, and further, that electricity is only another mode of the exertion\r\nof chemical forces. It is, the production of the _electric spark_ before\r\nany contact of metals is made, and by the exertion of _pure and unmixed\r\nchemical forces_. The experiment, which will be described further on\r\n(956.), consists in obtaining the spark upon making contact between a plate\r\nof zinc and a plate of copper plunged into dilute sulphuric acid. In order\r\nto make the arrangement as elementary as possible, mercurial surfaces were\r\ndismissed, and the contact made by a copper wire connected with the copper\r\nplate, and then brought to touch a clean part of the zinc plate. The\r\nelectric spark appeared, and it must of necessity have existed and passed\r\n_before the zinc and the copper were in contact_.\r\n\r\n916. In order to render more distinct the principles which I have been\r\nendeavouring to establish, I will restate them in their simplest form,\r\naccording to my present belief. The electricity of the voltaic pile (856.\r\nnote) is not dependent either in its origin or its continuance upon the\r\ncontact of the metals with each other (880. 915.). It is entirely due to\r\nchemical action (882.), and is proportionate in its intensity to the\r\nintensity of the affinities concerned in its production (908.); and in its\r\nquantity to the quantity of matter which has been chemically active during\r\nits evolution (869.). This definite production is again one of the\r\nstrongest proofs that the electricity is of chemical origin.\r\n\r\n917. As _volta-electro-generation_ is a case of mere chemical action, so\r\n_volta-electro-decomposition_ is simply a case of the preponderance of one\r\nset of chemical affinities more powerful in their nature, over another set\r\nwhich are less powerful: and if the instance of two opposing sets of such\r\nforces (891.) be considered, and their mutual relation and dependence borne\r\nin mind, there appears no necessity for using, in respect to such cases,\r\nany other term than chemical affinity, (though that of electricity may be\r\nvery convenient,) or supposing any new agent to be concerned in producing\r\nthe results; for we may consider that the powers at the two places of\r\naction are in direct communion and balanced against each other through the\r\nmedium of the metals (891.), fig. 76, in a manner analogous to that in\r\nwhich mechanical forces are balanced against each other by the intervention\r\nof the lever (1031.).\r\n\r\n918. All the facts show us that that power commonly called chemical\r\naffinity, can be communicated to a distance through the metals and certain\r\nforms of carbon; that the electric current is only another form of the\r\nforces of chemical affinity; that its power is in proportion to the\r\nchemical affinities producing it; that when it is deficient in force it may\r\nbe helped by calling in chemical aid, the want in the former being made up\r\nby an equivalent of the latter; that, in other words, _the forces termed\r\nchemical affinity and electricity are one and the same._\r\n\r\n919. When the circumstances connected with the production of electricity in\r\nthe ordinary voltaic circuit are examined and compared, it appears that the\r\nsource of that agent, always meaning the electricity which circulates and\r\ncompletes the current in the voltaic apparatus, and gives that apparatus\r\npower and character (947. 996.), exists in the chemical action which takes\r\nplace directly between the metal and the body with which it combines, and\r\nnot at all in the subsequent action of the substance so produced with the\r\nacid present[A]. Thus, when zinc, platina, and dilute sulphuric acid are\r\nused, it is the union of the zinc with the oxygen of the water which\r\ndetermines the current; and though the acid is essential to the removal of\r\nthe oxide so formed, in order that another portion of zinc may act on\r\nanother portion of water, it does not, by combination with that oxide,\r\nproduce any sensible portion of the current of electricity which\r\ncirculates; for the quantity of electricity is dependent upon the quantity\r\nof zinc oxidized, and in definite proportion to it: its intensity is in\r\nproportion to the intensity of the chemical affinity of the zinc for the\r\noxygen under the circumstances, and is scarcely, if at all, affected by the\r\nuse of either strong or weak acid (908.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Wollaston, Philosophical Transactions, 1801, p. 427.\r\n\r\n920. Again, if zinc, platina, and muriatic acid are used, the electricity\r\nappears to be dependent upon the affinity of the zinc for the chlorine, and\r\nto be circulated in exact proportion to the number of particles of zinc and\r\nchlorine which unite, being in fact an equivalent to them.\r\n\r\n921. But in considering this oxidation, or other direct action upon the\r\nMETAL itself, as the cause and source of the electric current, it is of the\r\nutmost importance to observe that the oxygen or other body must be in a\r\npeculiar condition, namely, in the state of _combination_; and not only so,\r\nbut limited still further to such a state of combination and in such\r\nproportions as will constitute an _electrolyte_ (823.). A pair of zinc and\r\nplatina plates cannot be so arranged in oxygen gas as to produce a current\r\nof electricity, or act as a voltaic circle, even though the temperature may\r\nbe raised so high as to cause oxidation of the zinc far more rapidly than\r\nif the pair of plates were plunged into dilute sulphuric acid; for the\r\noxygen is not part of an electrolyte, and cannot therefore conduct the\r\nforces onwards by decomposition, or even as metals do by itself. Or if its\r\ngaseous state embarrass the minds of some, then liquid chlorine may be\r\ntaken. It does not excite a current of electricity through the two plates\r\nby combining with the zinc, for its particles cannot transfer the\r\nelectricity active at the point of combination across to the platina. It is\r\nnot a conductor of itself, like the metals; nor is it an electrolyte, so as\r\nto be capable of conduction during decomposition, and hence there is simple\r\nchemical action at the spot, and no electric current[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] I do not mean to affirm that no traces of electricity ever appear\r\n  in such cases. What I mean is, that no electricity is evolved in any\r\n  way, due or related to the causes which excite voltaic electricity, or\r\n  proportionate to them. That which does appear occasionally is the\r\n  smallest possible fraction of that which the acting matter could\r\n  produce if arranged so as to act voltaically, probably not the one\r\n  hundred thousandth, or even the millionth part, and is very probably\r\n  altogether different in its source.\r\n\r\n922. It might at first be supposed that a conducting body not electrolytic,\r\nmight answer as the third substance between the zinc and the platina; and\r\nit is true that we have some such capable of exerting chemical action upon\r\nthe metals. They must, however, be chosen from the metals themselves, for\r\nthere are no bodies of this kind except those substances and charcoal. To\r\ndecide the matter by experiment, I made the following arrangement. Melted\r\ntin was put into a glass tube bent into the form of the letter V, fig. 78,\r\nso as to fill the half of each limb, and two pieces of thick platina wire,\r\n_p_, _w_, inserted, so as to have their ends immersed some depth in the\r\ntin: the whole was then allowed to cool, and the ends _p_ and _w_ connected\r\nwith a delicate galvanometer. The part of the tube at _x_ was now reheated,\r\nwhilst the portion _y_ was retained cool. The galvanometer was immediately\r\ninfluenced by the thermo-electric current produced. The heat was steadily\r\nincreased at _x_, until at last the tin and platina combined there; an\r\neffect which is known to take place with strong chemical action and high\r\nignition; but not the slightest additional effect occurred at the\r\ngalvanometer. No other deflection than that due to the thermo-electric\r\ncurrent was observable the whole time. Hence, though a conductor, and one\r\ncapable of exerting chemical action on the tin, was used, yet, not being an\r\n_electrolyte_, not the slightest effect of an electrical current could be\r\nobserved (947.).\r\n\r\n923. From this it seems apparent that the peculiar character and condition\r\nof an electrolyte is _essential_ in one part of the voltaic circuit; and\r\nits nature being considered, good reasons appear why it and it alone should\r\nbe effectual. An electrolyte is always a compound body: it can conduct, but\r\nonly whilst decomposing. Its conduction depends upon its decomposition and\r\nthe _transmission of its particles_ in directions parallel to the current;\r\nand so intimate is this connexion, that if their transition be stopped, the\r\ncurrent is stopped also; if their course be changed, its course and\r\ndirection change with them; if they proceed in one direction, it has no\r\npower to proceed in any other than a direction invariably dependent on\r\nthem. The particles of an electrolytic body are all so mutually connected,\r\nare in such relation with each other through their whole extent in the\r\ndirection of the current, that if the last is not disposed of, the first is\r\nnot at liberty to take up its place in the new combination which the\r\npowerful affinity of the most active metal tends to produce; and then the\r\ncurrent itself is stopped; for the dependencies of the current and the\r\ndecomposition are so mutual, that whichsoever be originally determined,\r\ni.e. the motion of the particles or the motion of the current, the other is\r\ninvariable in its concomitant production and its relation to it.\r\n\r\n924. Consider, then, water as an electrolyte and also as an oxidizing body.\r\nThe attraction of the zinc for the oxygen is greater, under the\r\ncircumstances, than that of the oxygen for the hydrogen; but in combining\r\nwith it, it tends to throw into circulation a current of electricity in a\r\ncertain direction. This direction is consistent (as is found by innumerable\r\nexperiments) with the transfer of the hydrogen from the zinc towards the\r\nplatina, and the transfer in the opposite direction of fresh oxygen from\r\nthe platina towards the zinc; so that the current _can pass_ in that one\r\nline, and, whilst it passes, can consist with and favour the renewal of the\r\nconditions upon the surface of the zinc, which at first determined both the\r\ncombination and circulation. Hence the continuance of the action there, and\r\nthe continuation of the current. It therefore appears quite as essential\r\nthat there should be an electrolyte in the circuit, in order that the\r\naction may be transferred forward, in a _certain constant direction,_ as\r\nthat there should be an oxidizing or other body capable of acting directly\r\non the metal; and it also appears to be essential that these two should\r\nmerge into one, or that the principle directly active on the metal by\r\nchemical action should be one of the _ions_ of the electrolyte used.\r\nWhether the voltaic arrangement be excited by solution of acids, or\r\nalkalies, or sulphurets, or by fused substances (476.), this principle has\r\nalways hitherto, as far as I am aware, been an _anion_ (943.); and I\r\nanticipate, from a consideration of the principles of electric action, that\r\nit must of necessity be one of that class of bodies.\r\n\r\n925. If the action of the sulphuric acid used in the voltaic circuit be\r\nconsidered, it will be found incompetent to produce any sensible portion of\r\nthe electricity of the current by its combination with the oxide formed,\r\nfor this simple reason, it is deficient in a most essential condition: it\r\nforms no part of an electrolyte, nor is it in relation with any other body\r\npresent in the solution which will permit of the mutual transfer of the\r\nparticles and the consequent transfer of the electricity. It is true, that\r\nas the plane at which the acid is dissolving the oxide of zinc formed by\r\nthe action of the water, is in contact with the metal zinc, there seems no\r\ndifficulty in considering how the oxide there could communicate an\r\nelectrical state, proportionate to its own chemical action on the acid, to\r\nthe metal, which is a conductor without decomposition. But on the side of\r\nthe acid there is no substance to complete the circuit: the water, as\r\nwater, cannot conduct it, or at least only so small a proportion that it is\r\nmerely an incidental and almost inappreciable effect (970.); and it cannot\r\nconduct it as an electrolyte, because an electrolyte conducts in\r\nconsequence of the _mutual_ relation and action of its particles; and\r\nneither of the elements of the water, nor even the water itself, as far as\r\nwe can perceive, are _ions_ with respect to the sulphuric acid (848.)[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] It will be seen that I here agree with Sir Humphry Davy, who has\r\n  experimentally supported the opinion that acids and alkalies in\r\n  combining do not produce any current of electricity. Philosophical\r\n  Transactions, 1826, p. 398.\r\n\r\n926. This view of the secondary character of the sulphuric acid as an agent\r\nin the production of the voltaic current, is further confirmed by the fact,\r\nthat the current generated and transmitted is directly and exactly\r\nproportional to the quantity of water decomposed and the quantity of zinc\r\noxidized (868. 991.), and is the same as that required to decompose the\r\nsame quantity of water. As, therefore, the decomposition of the water shows\r\nthat the electricity has passed by its means, there remains no other\r\nelectricity to be accounted for or to be referred to any action other than\r\nthat of the zinc and the water on each other.\r\n\r\n927. The general case (for it includes the former one (924.),) of acids and\r\nbases, may theoretically be stated in the following manner. Let _a_, fig.\r\n79, be supposed to be a dry oxacid, and _b_ a dry base, in contact at _c_,\r\nand in electric communication at their extremities by plates of platina\r\n_pp_, and a platina wire _w_. If this acid and base were fluid, and\r\ncombination took place at _c_, with an affinity ever so vigorous, and\r\ncapable of originating an electric current, the current could not circulate\r\nin any important degree; because, according to the experimental results,\r\nneither _a_ nor _b_ could conduct without being decomposed, for they are\r\neither electrolytes or else insulators, under all circumstances, except to\r\nvery feeble and unimportant currents (970. 986.). Now the affinities at _c_\r\nare not such as tend to cause the _elements_ either of _a_ or _b_ to\r\nseparate, but only such as would make the two bodies combine together as a\r\nwhole; the point of action is, therefore, insulated, the action itself\r\nlocal (921. 947.), and no current can be formed.\r\n\r\n928. If the acid and base be dissolved in water, then it is possible that a\r\nsmall portion of the electricity due to chemical action may be conducted by\r\nthe water without decomposition (966. 984.); but the quantity will be so\r\nsmall as to be utterly disproportionate to that due to the equivalents of\r\nchemical force; will be merely incidental; and, as it does not involve the\r\nessential principles of the voltaic pile, it forms no part of the phenomena\r\nat present under investigation[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] It will I trust be fully understood, that in these investigations\r\n  I am not professing to take an account of every small, incidental, or\r\n  barely possible effect, dependent upon slight disturbances of the\r\n  electric fluid during chemical action, but am seeking to distinguish\r\n  and identify those actions on which the power of the voltaic battery\r\n  essentially depends.\r\n\r\n929. If for the oxacid a hydracid be substituted (927.),--as one analogous\r\nto the muriatic, for instance,--then the state of things changes\r\naltogether, and a current due to the chemical action of the acid on the\r\nbase is possible. But now both the bodies act as electrolytes, for it is\r\nonly one principle of each which combine mutually,--as, for instance, the\r\nchlorine with the metal,--and the hydrogen of the acid and the oxygen of\r\nthe base are ready to traverse with the chlorine of the acid and the metal\r\nof the base in conformity with the current and according to the general\r\nprinciples already so fully laid down.\r\n\r\n930. This view of the oxidation of the metal, or other _direct_ chemical\r\naction upon it, being the sole cause of the production of the electric\r\ncurrent in the ordinary voltaic pile, is supported by the effects which\r\ntake place when alkaline or sulphuretted solutions (931. 943.) are used for\r\nthe electrolytic conductor instead of dilute sulphuric acid. It was in\r\nelucidation of this point that the experiments without metallic contact,\r\nand with solution of alkali as the exciting fluid, already referred to\r\n(884.), were made.\r\n\r\n931. Advantage was then taken of the more favourable condition offered,\r\nwhen metallic contact is allowed (895.), and the experiments upon the\r\ndecomposition of bodies by a single pair of plates (899.) were repeated,\r\nsolution of caustic potassa being employed in the vessel _v_, fig. 77. in\r\nplace of dilute sulphuric acid. All the effects occurred as before: the\r\ngalvanometer was deflected; the decompositions of the solutions of iodide\r\nof potassium, nitrate of silver, muriatic acid, and sulphate of soda ensued\r\nat _x_; and the places where the evolved principles appeared, as well as\r\nthe deflection of the galvanometer, indicated a current in the _same\r\ndirection_ as when acid was in the vessel _v_; i.e. from the zinc through\r\nthe solution to the platina, and back by the galvanometer and substance\r\nsuffering decomposition to the zinc.\r\n\r\n932. The similarity in the action of either dilute sulphuric acid or\r\npotassa goes indeed far beyond this, even to the proof of identity in\r\n_quantity_ as well as in _direction_ of the electricity produced. If a\r\nplate of amalgamated zinc be put into a solution of potassa, it is not\r\nsensibly acted upon; but if touched in the solution by a plate of platina,\r\nhydrogen is evolved on the surface of the latter metal, and the zinc is\r\noxidized exactly as when immersed in dilute sulphuric acid (863.). I\r\naccordingly repeated the experiment before described with weighed plates of\r\nzinc (864. &c.), using however solution of potassa instead of dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. Although the time required was much longer than when acid\r\nwas used, amounting to three hours for the oxidizement of 7.55 grains of\r\nzinc, still I found that the hydrogen evolved at the platina plate was the\r\nequivalent of the metal oxidized at the surface of the zinc. Hence the\r\nwhole of the reasoning which was applicable in the former instance applies\r\nalso here, the current being in the same direction, and its decomposing\r\neffect in the same degree, as if acid instead of alkali had been used\r\n(868.).\r\n\r\n933. The proof, therefore, appears to me complete, that the combination of\r\nthe acid with the oxide, in the former experiment, had nothing to do with\r\nthe production of the electric current; for the same current is here\r\nproduced when the action of the acid is absent, and the reverse action of\r\nan alkali is present. I think it cannot be supposed for a moment, that the\r\nalkali acted chemically as an acid to the oxide formed; on the contrary,\r\nour general chemical knowledge leads to the conclusion, that the ordinary\r\nmetallic oxides act rather as acids to the alkalies; yet that kind of\r\naction would tend to give a reverse current in the present case, if any\r\nwere due to the union of the oxide of the exciting metal with the body\r\nwhich combines with it. But instead of any variation of this sort, the\r\ndirection of the electricity was constant, and its quantity also directly\r\nproportional to the water decomposed, or the zinc oxidized. There are\r\nreasons for believing that acids and alkalies, when in contact with metals\r\nupon which they cannot act directly, still have a power of influencing\r\ntheir attractions for oxygen (941.); but all the effects in these\r\nexperiments prove, I think, that it is the oxidation of the metal\r\nnecessarily dependent upon, and associated as it is with, the\r\nelectrolyzation of the water (921. 923.) that produces the current; and\r\nthat the acid or alkali merely acts as solvents, and by removing the\r\noxidized zinc, allows other portions to decompose fresh water, and so\r\ncontinues the evolution or determination of the current.\r\n\r\n934. The experiments were then varied by using solution of ammonia instead\r\nof solution of potassa; and as it, when pure, is like water, a bad\r\nconductor (554.), it was occasionally improved in that power by adding\r\nsulphate of ammonia to it. But in all the cases the results were the same\r\nas before; decompositions of the same kind were effected, and the electric\r\ncurrent producing these was in the same direction as in the experiments\r\njust described.\r\n\r\n935. In order to put the equal and similar action of acid and alkali to\r\nstronger proof, arrangements were made as in fig. 80.; the glass vessel A\r\ncontained dilute sulphuric acid, the corresponding glass vessel B solution\r\nof potassa, PP was a plate of platina dipping into both solutions, and ZZ\r\ntwo plates of amalgamated zinc connected with a delicate galvanometer. When\r\nthese were plunged at the same time into the two vessels, there was\r\ngenerally a first feeble effect, and that in favour of the alkali, i.e. the\r\nelectric current tended to pass through the vessels in the direction of the\r\narrow, being the reverse direction of that which the acid in A would have\r\nproduced alone: but the effect instantly ceased, and the action of the\r\nplates in the vessels was so equal, that, being contrary because of the\r\ncontrary position of the plates, no permanent current resulted.\r\n\r\n936. Occasionally a zinc plate was substituted for the plate PP, and\r\nplatina plates for the plates ZZ; but this caused no difference in the\r\nresults: nor did a further change of the middle plate to copper produce any\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\n937. As the opposition of electro-motive pairs of plates produces results\r\nother than those due to the mere difference of their independent actions\r\n(1011. 1045.), I devised another form of apparatus, in which the action of\r\nacid and alkali might be more directly compared. A cylindrical glass cup,\r\nabout two inches deep within, an inch in internal diameter, and at least a\r\nquarter of an inch in thickness, was cut down the middle into halves, fig.\r\n81. A broad brass ring, larger in diameter than the cup, was supplied with\r\na screw at one side; so that when the two halves of the cup were within the\r\nring, and the screw was made to press tightly against the glass, the cup\r\nheld any fluid put into it. Bibulous paper of different degrees of\r\npermeability was then cut into pieces of such a size as to be easily\r\nintroduced between the loosened halves of the cup, and served when the\r\nlatter were tightened again to form a porous division down the middle of\r\nthe cup, sufficient to keep any two fluids on opposite sides of the paper\r\nfrom mingling, except very slowly, and yet allowing them to act freely as\r\none _electrolyte_. The two spaces thus produced I will call the cells A and\r\nB, fig. 82. This instrument I have found of most general application in the\r\ninvestigation of the relation of fluids and metals amongst themselves and\r\nto each other. By combining its use with that of the galvanometer, it is\r\neasy to ascertain the relation of one metal with two fluids, or of two\r\nmetals with one fluid, or of two metals and two fluids upon each other.\r\n\r\n938. Dilute sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1.25, was put into the cell A, and a\r\nstrong solution of caustic potassa into the cell B; they mingled slowly\r\nthrough the paper, and at last a thick crust of sulphate of potassa formed\r\non the side of the paper next to the alkali. A plate of clean platina was\r\nput into each cell and connected with a delicate galvanometer, but no\r\nelectric current could be observed. Hence the _contact_ of acid with one\r\nplatina plate, and alkali with the other, was unable to produce a current;\r\nnor was the combination of the acid with the alkali more effectual (925.).\r\n\r\n939. When one of the platina plates was removed and a zinc plate\r\nsubstituted, either amalgamated or not, a strong electric current was\r\nproduced. But, whether the zinc were in the acid whilst the platina was in\r\nthe alkali, or whether the reverse order were chosen, the electric current\r\nwas always from the zinc through the electrolyte to the platina, and back\r\nthrough the galvanometer to the zinc, the current seeming to be strongest\r\nwhen the zinc was in the alkali and the platina in the acid.\r\n\r\n940. In these experiments, therefore, the acid seems to have no power over\r\nthe alkali, but to be rather inferior to it in force. Hence there is no\r\nreason to suppose that the combination of the oxide formed with the acid\r\naround it has any direct influence in producing the electricity evolved,\r\nthe whole of which appears to be due to the oxidation of the metal (919.).\r\n\r\n941. The alkali, in fact, is superior to the acid in bringing a metal into\r\nwhat is called the positive state; for if plates of the same metal, as\r\nzinc, tin, lead, or copper, be used both in the acid or alkali, the\r\nelectric current is from the alkali across the cell to the acid, and back\r\nthrough the galvanometer to the alkali, as Sir Humphry Davy formerly stated\r\n[A]. This current is so powerful, that if amalgamated zinc, or tin, or lead\r\nbe used, the metal in the acid evolves hydrogen the moment it is placed in\r\ncommunication with that in the alkali, not from any direct action of the\r\nacid upon it, for if the contact be broken the action ceases, but because\r\nit is powerfully negative with regard to the metal in the alkali.\r\n\r\n  [A] Elements of Chemical Philosophy, p. 149; or Philosophical\r\n  Transactions, 1826, p. 403.\r\n\r\n942. The superiority of alkali is further proved by this, that if zinc and\r\ntin be used, or tin and lead, whichsoever metal is put into the alkali\r\nbecomes positive, that in the acid being negative. Whichsoever is in the\r\nalkali is oxidized, whilst that in the acid remains in the metallic state,\r\nas far as the electric current is concerned.\r\n\r\n943. When sulphuretted solutions are used (930.) in illustration of the\r\nassertion, that it is the chemical action of the metal and one of the\r\n_ions_ of the associated electrolyte that produces all the electricity of\r\nthe voltaic circuit, the proofs are still the same. Thus, as Sir Humphry\r\nDavy[A] has shown, if iron and copper be plunged into dilute acid, the\r\ncurrent is from the iron through the liquid to the copper; in solution of\r\npotassa it is in the same direction, but in solution of sulphuret of\r\npotassa it is reversed. In the two first cases it is oxygen which combines\r\nwith the iron, in the latter sulphur which combines with the copper, that\r\nproduces the electric current; but both of these are _ions_, existing as\r\nsuch in the electrolyte, which is at the same moment suffering\r\ndecomposition; and, what is more, both of these are _anions_, for they\r\nleave the electrolytes at their _anodes_, and act just as chlorine, iodine,\r\nor any other _anion_ would act which might have been previously chosen as\r\nthat which should be used to throw the voltaic circle into activity.\r\n\r\n  [A] Elements of Chemical Philosophy, p. 148.\r\n\r\n944. The following experiments complete the series of proofs of the origin\r\nof the electricity in the voltaic pile. A fluid amalgam of potassium,\r\ncontaining not more than a hundredth of that metal, was put into pure\r\nwater, and connected, through the galvanometer with a plate of platina in\r\nthe same water. There was immediately an electric current from the amalgam\r\nthrough the electrolyte to the platina. This must have been due to the\r\noxidation only of the metal, for there was neither acid nor alkali to\r\ncombine with, or in any way act on, the body produced.\r\n\r\n945. Again, a plate of clean lead and a plate of platina were put into\r\n_pure_ water. There was immediately a powerful current produced from the\r\nlead through the fluid to the platina: it was even intense enough to\r\ndecompose solution of the iodide of potassium when introduced into the\r\ncircuit in the form of apparatus already described (880.), fig. 73. Here no\r\naction of acid or alkali on the oxide formed from the lead could supply the\r\nelectricity: it was due solely to the oxidation of the metal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n946. There is no point in electrical science which seems to me of more\r\nimportance than the state of the metals and the electrolytic conductor in a\r\nsimple voltaic circuit _before and at_ the moment when metallic contact is\r\nfirst completed. If clearly understood, I feel no doubt it would supply us\r\nwith a direct key to the laws under which the great variety of voltaic\r\nexcitements, direct and incidental, occur, and open out new fields of\r\nresearch for our investigation[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In connexion with this part of the subject refer now to Series XI.\r\n  1164, Series XII. 1343-1358, and Series XIII. 1621. &c.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n947. We seem to have the power of deciding to a certain extent in numerous\r\ncases of chemical affinity, (as of zinc with the oxygen of water, &c. &c.)\r\nwhich of _two modes of action of the attractive power_ shall be exerted\r\n(996.). In the one mode we can transfer the power onwards, and make it\r\nproduce elsewhere its equivalent of action (867. 917.); in the other, it is\r\nnot transferred, but exerted wholly at the spot. The first is the case of\r\nvolta-electric excitation, the other ordinary chemical affinity: but both\r\nare chemical actions and due to one force or principle.\r\n\r\n948. The general circumstances of the former mode occur in all instances of\r\nvoltaic currents, but may be considered as in their perfect condition, and\r\nthen free from those of the second mode, in some only of the cases; as in\r\nthose of plates of zinc and platina in solution of potassa, or of\r\namalgamated zinc and platina in dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n949. Assuming it sufficiently proved, by the preceding experiments and\r\nconsiderations, that the electro-motive action depends, when zinc, platina,\r\nand dilute sulphuric acid are used, upon the mutual affinity of the metal\r\nzinc and the oxygen of the water (921. 924.), it would appear that the\r\nmetal, when alone, has not power enough, under the circumstances, to take\r\nthe oxygen and expel the hydrogen from the water; for, in fact, no such\r\naction takes place. But it would also appear that it has power so far to\r\nact, by its attraction for the oxygen of the particles in contact with it,\r\nas to place the similar forces already active between these and the other\r\nparticles of oxygen and the particles of hydrogen in the water, in a\r\npeculiar state of tension or polarity, and probably also at the same time\r\nto throw those of its own particles which are in contact with the water\r\ninto a similar but opposed state. Whilst this state is retained, no further\r\nchange occurs; but when it is relieved, by completion of the circuit, in\r\nwhich case the forces determined in opposite directions, with respect to\r\nthe zinc and the electrolyte, are found exactly competent to neutralize\r\neach other, then a series of decompositions and recompositions takes place\r\namongst the particles of oxygen and hydrogen constituting the water,\r\nbetween the place of contact with the platina and the place where the zinc\r\nis active; these intervening particles being evidently in close dependence\r\nupon and relation to each other. The zinc forms a direct compound with\r\nthose particles of oxygen which were, previously, in divided relation to\r\nboth it and the hydrogen: the oxide is removed by the acid, and a fresh\r\nsurface of zinc is presented to the water, to renew and repeat the action.\r\n\r\n950. Practically, the state of tension is best relieved by dipping a metal\r\nwhich has less attraction for oxygen than the zinc, into the dilute acid,\r\nand making it also touch the zinc. The force of chemical affinity, which\r\nhas been influenced or polarized in the particles of the water by the\r\ndominant attraction of the zinc for the oxygen, is then transferred, in a\r\nmost extraordinary manner, through the two metals, so as to re-enter upon\r\nthe circuit in the electrolytic conductor, which, unlike the metals in that\r\nrespect, cannot convey or transfer it without suffering decomposition; or\r\nrather, probably, it is exactly balanced and neutralized by the force which\r\nat the same moment completes the combination of the zinc with the oxygen of\r\nthe water. The forces, in fact, of the two particles which are acting\r\ntowards each other, and which are therefore in opposite directions, are the\r\norigin of the two opposite forces, or directions of force, in the current.\r\nThey are of necessity equivalent to each other. Being transferred forward\r\nin contrary directions, they produce what is called the voltaic current:\r\nand it seems to me impossible to resist the idea that it must be preceded\r\nby a _state of tension_ in the fluid, and between the fluid and the zinc;\r\nthe _first consequence_ of the affinity of the zinc for the oxygen of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n951. I have sought carefully for indications of a state of tension in the\r\nelectrolytic conductor; and conceiving that it might produce something like\r\nstructure, either before or during its discharge, I endeavoured to make\r\nthis evident by polarized light. A glass cell, seven inches long, one inch\r\nand a half wide, and six inches deep, had two sets of platina electrodes\r\nadapted to it, one set for the ends, and the other for the sides. Those for\r\nthe _sides_ were seven inches long by three inches high, and when in the\r\ncell were separated by a little frame of wood covered with calico; so that\r\nwhen made active by connexion with a battery upon any solution in the cell,\r\nthe bubbles of gas rising from them did not obscure the central parts of\r\nthe liquid.\r\n\r\n952. A saturated solution of sulphate of soda was put into the cell, and\r\nthe electrodes connected with a battery of 150 pairs of 4-inch plates: the\r\ncurrent of electricity was conducted across the cell so freely, that the\r\ndischarge was as good as if a wire had been used. A ray of polarized light\r\nwas then transmitted through this solution, directly across the course of\r\nthe electric current, and examined by an analysing plate; but though it\r\npenetrated seven inches of solution thus subject to the action of the\r\nelectricity, and though contact was sometimes made, sometimes broken, and\r\noccasionally reversed during the observations, not the slightest trace of\r\naction on the ray could be perceived.\r\n\r\n953. The large electrodes were then removed, and others introduced which\r\nfitted the _ends_ of the cell. In each a slit was cut, so as to allow the\r\nlight to pass. The course of the polarized ray was now parallel to the\r\ncurrent, or in the direction of its axis (517.); but still no effect, under\r\nany circumstances of contact or disunion, could be perceived upon it.\r\n\r\n954. A strong solution of nitrate of lead was employed instead of the\r\nsulphate of soda, but no effects could be detected.\r\n\r\n955. Thinking it possible that the discharge of the electric forces by the\r\nsuccessive decompositions and recompositions of the particles of the\r\nelectrolyte might neutralize and therefore destroy any effect which the\r\nfirst state of tension could by possibility produce, I took a substance\r\nwhich, being an excellent electrolyte when fluid, was a perfect insulator\r\nwhen solid, namely, borate of lead, in the form of a glass plate, and\r\nconnecting the sides and the edges of this mass with the metallic plates,\r\nsometimes in contact with the poles of a voltaic battery, and sometimes\r\neven with the electric machine, for the advantage of the much higher\r\nintensity then obtained, I passed a polarized ray across it in various\r\ndirections, as before, but could not obtain the slightest appearance of\r\naction upon the light. Hence I conclude, that notwithstanding the new and\r\nextraordinary state which must be assumed by an electrolyte, either during\r\ndecomposition (when a most enormous quantity of electricity must be\r\ntraversing it), or in the state of tension which is assumed as preceding\r\ndecomposition, and which might be supposed to be retained in the solid form\r\nof the electrolyte, still it has no power of affecting a polarized ray of\r\nlight; for no kind of structure or tension can in this way be rendered\r\nevident.\r\n\r\n956. There is, however, one beautiful experimental proof of a state of\r\ntension acquired by the metals and the electrolyte before the electric\r\ncurrent is produced, and _before contact_ of the different metals is made\r\n(915.); in fact, at that moment when chemical forces only are efficient as\r\na cause of action. I took a voltaic apparatus, consisting of a single pair\r\nof large plates, namely, a cylinder of amalgamated zinc, and a double\r\ncylinder of copper. These were put into a jar containing dilute sulphuric\r\nacid[A], and could at pleasure be placed in metallic communication by a\r\ncopper wire adjusted so as to dip at the extremities into two cups of\r\nmercury connected with the two plates.\r\n\r\n  [A] When nitro-sulphuric acid is used, the spark is more powerful, but\r\n  local chemical action can then commence, and proceed without requiring\r\n  metallic contact.\r\n\r\n957. Being thus arranged, there was no chemical action whilst the plates\r\nwere not connected. On _making_ the connexion a spark was obtained[A], and\r\nthe solution was immediately decomposed. On breaking it, the usual spark\r\nwas obtained, and the decomposition ceased. In this case it is evident that\r\nthe first spark must have occurred before metallic contact was made, for it\r\npassed through an interval of air; and also that it must have tended to\r\npass before the electrolytic action began; for the latter could not take\r\nplace until the current passed, and the current could not pass before the\r\nspark appeared. Hence I think there is sufficient proof, that as it is the\r\nzinc and water which by their mutual action produce the electricity of this\r\napparatus, so these, by their first contact with each other, were placed in\r\na state of powerful tension (951.), which, though it could not produce the\r\nactual decomposition of the water, was able to make a spark of electricity\r\npass between the zinc and a fit discharger as soon as the interval was\r\nrendered sufficiently small. The experiment demonstrates the direct\r\nproduction of the electric spark from pure chemical forces.\r\n\r\n  [A] It has been universally supposed that no spark is produced on\r\n  making the contact between a single pair of plates. I was led to\r\n  expect one from the considerations already advanced in this paper. The\r\n  wire of communication should be short; for with a long wire,\r\n  circumstances strongly affecting the spark are introduced.\r\n\r\n958. There are a few circumstances connected with the production of this\r\nspark by a single pair of plates, which should be known, to ensure success\r\nto the experiment[B]. When the amalgamated surfaces of contact are quite\r\nclean and dry, the spark, on making contact, is quite as brilliant as on\r\nbreaking it, if not even more so. When a film of oxide or dirt was present\r\nat either mercurial surface, then the first spark was often feeble, and\r\noften failed, the breaking spark, however, continuing very constant and\r\nbright. When a little water was put over the mercury, the spark was greatly\r\ndiminished in brilliancy, but very regular both on making and breaking\r\ncontact. When the contact was made between clean platina, the spark was\r\nalso very small, but regular both ways. The true electric spark is, in\r\nfact, very small, and when surfaces of mercury are used, it is the\r\ncombustion of the metal which produces the greater part of the light. The\r\ncircumstances connected with the burning of the mercury are most favourable\r\non breaking contact; for the act of separation exposes clean surfaces of\r\nmetal, whereas, on making contact, a thin film of oxide, or soiling matter,\r\noften interferes. Hence the origin of the general opinion that it is only\r\nwhen the contact is broken that the spark passes.\r\n\r\n  [B] See in relation to precautions respecting a spark, 1074.--_Dec.\r\n  1838._\r\n\r\n959. With reference to the other set of cases, namely, those of local\r\naction (947.) in which chemical affinity being exerted causes no\r\ntransference of the power to a distance where no electric current is\r\nproduced, it is evident that forces of the most intense kind must be\r\nactive, and in some way balanced in their activity, during such\r\ncombinations; these forces being directed so immediately and exclusively\r\ntowards each other, that no signs of the powerful electric current they can\r\nproduce become apparent, although the same final state of things is\r\nobtained as if that current had passed. It was Berzelius, I believe, who\r\nconsidered the heat and light evolved in cases of combustion as the\r\nconsequences of this mode of exertion of the electric powers of the\r\ncombining particles. But it will require a much more exact and extensive\r\nknowledge of the nature of electricity, and the manner in which it is\r\nassociated with the atoms of matter, before we can understand accurately\r\nthe action of this power in thus causing their union, or comprehend the\r\nnature of the great difference which it presents in the two modes of action\r\njust distinguished. We may imagine, but such imaginations must for the time\r\nbe classed with the great mass of _doubtful knowledge_ (876.) which we\r\nought rather to strive to diminish than to increase; for the very extensive\r\ncontradictions of this knowledge by itself shows that but a small portion\r\nof it can ultimately prove true[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Refer to 1738, &c. Series XIV.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n960. Of the two modes of action in which chemical affinity is exerted, it\r\nis important to remark, that that which produces the electric current is as\r\n_definite_ as that which causes ordinary chemical combination; so that in\r\nexamining the _production_ or _evolution_ of electricity in cases of\r\ncombination or decomposition, it will be necessary, not merely to observe\r\ncertain effects dependent upon a current of electricity, but also their\r\n_quantity_: and though it may often happen that the forces concerned in any\r\nparticular case of chemical action may be partly exerted in one mode and\r\npartly in the other, it is only those which are efficient in producing the\r\ncurrent that have any relation to voltaic action. Thus, in the combination\r\nof oxygen and hydrogen to produce water, electric powers to a most enormous\r\namount are for the time active (861. 873.); but any mode of examining the\r\nflame which they form during energetic combination, which has as yet been\r\ndevised, has given but the feeblest traces. These therefore may not,\r\ncannot, be taken as evidences of the nature of the action; but are merely\r\nincidental results, incomparably small in relation to the forces concerned,\r\nand supplying no information of the way in which the particles are active\r\non each other, or in which their forces are finally arranged.\r\n\r\n961. That such cases of chemical action produce no _current of\r\nelectricity_, is perfectly consistent with what we know of the voltaic\r\napparatus, in which it is essential that one of the combining elements\r\nshall form part of, or be in direct relation with, an electrolytic\r\nconductor (921. 923.). That such cases produce _no free electricity of\r\ntension_, and that when they are converted into cases of voltaic action\r\nthey produce a current in which the opposite forces are so equal as to\r\nneutralize each other, prove the equality of the forces in the opposed\r\nacting particles of matter, and therefore the equality of electric power in\r\nthose quantities of matter which are called _electro-chemical equivalents_\r\n(824). Hence another proof of the definite nature of electro-chemical\r\naction (783. &c.), and that chemical affinity and electricity are forms of\r\nthe same power (917. &c.).\r\n\r\n962. The direct reference of the effects produced by the voltaic pile at\r\nthe place of experimental decomposition to the chemical affinities active\r\nat the place of excitation (891. 917.), gives a very simple and natural\r\nview of the cause why the bodies (or _ions_) evolved pass in certain\r\ndirections; for it is only when they pass in those directions that their\r\nforces can consist with and compensate (in direction at least) the superior\r\nforces which are dominant at the place where the action of the whole is\r\ndetermined. If, for instance, in a voltaic circuit, the activity of which\r\nis determined, by the attraction of zinc for the oxygen of water, the zinc\r\nmove from right to left, then any other _cation_ included in the circuit,\r\nbeing part of an electrolyte, or forming part of it at the moment, will\r\nalso move from right to left: and as the oxygen of the water, by its\r\nnatural affinity for the zinc, moves from left to right, so any other body\r\nof the same class with it (i.e. any other _anion_), under its government\r\nfor the time, will move from left to right.\r\n\r\n963. This I may illustrate by reference to fig. 83, the double circle of\r\nwhich may represent a complete voltaic circuit, the direction of its forces\r\nbeing determined by supposing for a moment the zinc _b_ and the platina _c_\r\nas representing plates of those metals acting upon water, _d, e_, and other\r\nsubstances, but having their energy exalted so as to effect several\r\ndecompositions by the use of a battery at _a_ (989.). This supposition may\r\nbe allowed, because the action in the battery will only consist of\r\nrepetitions of what would take place between _b_ and _c_, if they really\r\nconstituted but a single pair. The zinc _b_, and the oxygen _d_, by their\r\nmutual affinity, tend to unite; but as the oxygen is already in association\r\nwith the hydrogen _e_, and has its inherent chemical or electric powers\r\nneutralized for the time by those of the latter, the hydrogen _e_ must\r\nleave the oxygen _d_, and advance in the direction of the arrow head, or\r\nelse the zinc _b_ cannot move in the same direction to unite to the oxygen\r\n_d_, nor the oxygen _d_ move in the contrary direction to unite to the zinc\r\n_b_, the relation of the _similar_ forces of _b_ and _c_, in contrary\r\ndirections, to the _opposite_ forces of _d_ being the preventive. As the\r\nhydrogen _e_ advances, it, on coming against the platina _c, f_, which\r\nforms a part of the circuit, communicates its electric or chemical forces\r\nthrough it to the next electrolyte in the circuit, fused chloride of lead,\r\n_g, h_, where the chlorine must move in conformity with the direction of\r\nthe oxygen at _d_, for it has to compensate the forces disturbed in its\r\npart of the circuit by the superior influence of those between the oxygen\r\nand zinc at _d, b_, aided as they are by those of the battery _a_; and for\r\na similar reason the lead must move in the direction pointed out by the\r\narrow head, that it may be in right relation to the first moving body of\r\nits own class, namely, the zinc _b_. If copper intervene in the circuit\r\nfrom _i_ to _k_, it acts as the platina did before; and if another\r\nelectrolyte, as the iodide of tin, occur at _l, m_, then the iodine _l_,\r\nbeing an _anion_, must move in conformity with the exciting _anion_,\r\nnamely, the oxygen _d_, and the _cation_ tin _m_ move in correspondence\r\nwith the other _cations b, e_, and _h_, that the chemical forces may be in\r\nequilibrium as to their direction and quantity throughout the circuit.\r\nShould it so happen that the anions in their circulation can combine with\r\nthe metals at the _anodes_ of the respective electrolytes, as would be the\r\ncase at the platina _f_ and the copper _k_, then those bodies becoming\r\nparts of electrolytes, under the influence of the current, immediately\r\ntravel; but considering their relation to the zinc _b_, it is evidently\r\nimpossible that they can travel in any other direction than what will\r\naccord with its course, and therefore can never tend to pass otherwise than\r\n_from_ the anode and _to_ the cathode.\r\n\r\n964. In such a circle as that delineated, therefore, all the known _anions_\r\nmay be grouped within, and all the _cations_ without. If any number of them\r\nenter as _ions_ into the constitution of _electrolytes_, and, forming one\r\ncircuit, are simultaneously subject to one common current, the anions must\r\nmove in accordance with each other in one direction, and the cations in the\r\nother. Nay, more than that, equivalent portions of these bodies must so\r\nadvance in opposite directions: for the advance of every 32.5 parts of the\r\nzinc _b_ must be accompanied by a motion in the opposite direction of 8\r\nparts of oxygen at _d_, of 36 parts of chlorine at _g_, of 126 parts of\r\niodine at _l_; and in the same direction by electro-chemical equivalents of\r\nhydrogen, lead, copper and tin, at _e, h, k_. and _m_.\r\n\r\n965. If the present paper be accepted as a correct expression of facts, it\r\nwill still only prove a confirmation of certain general views put forth by\r\nSir Humphry Davy in his Bakerian Lecture for 1806[A], and revised and\r\nre-stated by him in another Bakerian Lecture, on electrical and chemical\r\nchanges, for the year 1826[B]. His general statement is, that \"_chemical\r\nand electrical attractions were produced by the same cause, acting in one\r\ncase on particles, in the other on masses, of matter; and that the same\r\nproperty, under different modifications, was the cause of all the phenomena\r\nexhibited by different voltaic combinations_[C].\" This statement I believe\r\nto be true; but in admitting and supporting it, I must guard myself from\r\nbeing supposed to assent to all that is associated with it in the two\r\npapers referred to, or as admitting the experiments which are there quoted\r\nas decided proofs of the truth of the principle. Had I thought them so,\r\nthere would have been no occasion for this investigation. It may be\r\nsupposed by some that I ought to go through these papers, distinguishing\r\nwhat I admit from what I reject, and giving good experimental or\r\nphilosophical reasons for the judgment in both cases. But then I should be\r\nequally bound to review, for the same purpose, all that has been written\r\nboth for and against the necessity of metallic contact,--for and against\r\nthe origin of voltaic electricity in chemical action,--a duty which I may\r\nnot undertake in the present paper[D].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1807.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. 1826, p. 383.\r\n\r\n  [C] Ibid. 1826, p. 389.\r\n\r\n  [D] I at one time intended to introduce here, in the form of a note, a\r\n  table of reference to the papers of the different philosophers who\r\n  have referred the origin of the electricity in the voltaic pile to\r\n  contact, or to chemical action, or to both; but on the publication of\r\n  the first volume of M. Becquerel's highly important and valuable\r\n  Traité de l'Electricité et du Magnétisme, I thought it far better to\r\n  refer to that work for these references, and the views held by the\r\n  authors quoted. See pages 86, 91, 104, 110, 112, 117, 118, 120, 151,\r\n  152, 224, 227, 228, 232, 233, 252, 255, 257, 258, 290, &c.--July 3rd,\r\n  1834.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ ii. _On the Intensity necessary for Electrolyzation._\r\n\r\n966. It became requisite, for the comprehension of many of the conditions\r\nattending voltaic action, to determine positively, if possible, whether\r\nelectrolytes could resist the action of an electric current when beneath a\r\ncertain intensity? whether the intensity at which the current ceased to act\r\nwould be the same for all bodies? and also whether the electrolytes thus\r\nresisting decomposition would conduct the electric current as a metal does,\r\nafter they ceased to conduct as electrolytes, or would act as perfect\r\ninsulators?\r\n\r\n967. It was evident from the experiments described (904. 906.) that\r\ndifferent bodies were decomposed with very different facilities, and\r\napparently that they required for their decomposition currents of different\r\nintensities, resisting some, but giving way to others. But it was needful,\r\nby very careful and express experiments, to determine whether a current\r\ncould really pass through, and yet not decompose an electrolyte (910.).\r\n\r\n968. An arrangement (fig. 84.) was made, in which two glass vessels\r\ncontained the same dilute sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1.25. The plate _z_ was\r\namalgamated zinc, in connexion, by a platina wire _a_, with the platina\r\nplate _e_; _b_ was a platina wire connecting the two platina plates PP';\r\n_c_ was a platina wire connected with the platina plate P\". On the plate\r\n_e_ was placed a piece of paper moistened in solution of iodide of\r\npotassium: the wire _c_ was so curved that its end could be made to rest at\r\npleasure on this paper, and show, by the evolution of iodine there, whether\r\na current was passing; or, being placed in the dotted position, it formed a\r\ndirect communication with the platina plate _e_, and the electricity could\r\npass without causing decomposition. The object was to produce a current by\r\nthe action of the acid on the amalgamated zinc in the first vessel A; to\r\npass it through the acid in the second vessel B by platina electrodes, that\r\nits power of decomposing water might, if existing, be observed; and to\r\nverify the existence of the current at pleasure, by decomposition at _e_,\r\nwithout involving the continual obstruction to the current which would\r\narise from making the decomposition there constant. The experiment, being\r\narranged, was examined and the existence of a current ascertained by the\r\ndecomposition at _e_; the whole was then left with the end of the wire _c_\r\nresting on the plate _e_, so as to form a constant metallic communication\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n969. After several hours, the end of the wire _c_ was replaced on the\r\ntest-paper at _e_: decomposition occurred, and _the proof_ of a passing\r\ncurrent was therefore complete. The current was very feeble compared to\r\nwhat it had been at the beginning of the experiment, because of a peculiar\r\nstate acquired by the metal surfaces in the second vessel, which caused\r\nthem to oppose the passing current by a force which they possess under\r\nthese circumstances (1040.). Still it was proved, by the decomposition,\r\nthat this state of the plates in the second vessel was not able entirely to\r\nstop the current determined in the first, and that was all that was needful\r\nto be ascertained in the present inquiry.\r\n\r\n970. This apparatus was examined from time to time, and an electric current\r\nalways found circulating through it, until twelve days had elapsed, during\r\nwhich the water in the second vessel had been constantly subject to its\r\naction. Notwithstanding this lengthened period, not the slightest\r\nappearance of a bubble upon either of the plates in that vessel occurred.\r\nFrom the results of the experiment, I conclude that a current _had_ passed,\r\nbut of so low an intensity as to fall beneath that degree at which the\r\nelements of water, unaided by any secondary force resulting from the\r\ncapability of combination with the matter of the electrodes, or of the\r\nliquid surrounding them, separated from each other.\r\n\r\n971. It may be supposed, that the oxygen and hydrogen had been evolved in\r\nsuch small quantities as to have entirely dissolved in the water, and\r\nfinally to have escaped at the surface, or to have reunited into water.\r\nThat the hydrogen can be so dissolved was shown in the first vessel; for\r\nafter several days minute bubbles of gas gradually appeared upon a glass\r\nrod, inserted to retain the zinc and platina apart, and also upon the\r\nplatina plate itself, and these were hydrogen. They resulted principally in\r\nthis way:--notwithstanding the amalgamation of the zinc, the acid exerted a\r\nlittle direct action upon it, so that a small stream of hydrogen bubbles\r\nwas continually rising from its surface; a little of this hydrogen\r\ngradually dissolved in the dilute acid, and was in part set free against\r\nthe surfaces of the rod and the plate, according to the well-known action\r\nof such solid bodies in solutions of gases (623. &c.).\r\n\r\n972. But if the gases had been evolved in the second vessel by the\r\ndecomposition of water, and had tended to dissolve, still there would have\r\nbeen every reason to expect that a few bubbles should have appeared on the\r\nelectrodes, especially on the negative one, if it were only because of its\r\naction as a nucleus on the solution supposed to be formed; but none\r\nappeared even after twelve days.\r\n\r\n973. When a few drops only of nitric acid were added to the vessel A, fig.\r\n84, then the results were altogether different. In less than five minutes\r\nbubbles of gas appeared on the plates P' and P\" in the second vessel. To\r\nprove that this was the effect of the electric current (which by trial at\r\n_c_ was found at the same time to be passing,) the connexion at _c_ was\r\nbroken, the plates P'P\" cleared from bubbles and left in the acid of the\r\nvessel B, for fifteen minutes: during that time no bubbles appeared upon\r\nthem; but on restoring the communication at _c_, a minute did not elapse\r\nbefore gas appeared in bubbles upon the plates. The proof, therefore, is\r\nmost full and complete, that the current excited by dilute sulphuric acid\r\nwith a little nitric acid in vessel A, has intensity enough to overcome the\r\nchemical affinity exerted between the oxygen and hydrogen of the water in\r\nthe vessel B, whilst that excited by dilute sulphuric acid alone has _not_\r\nsufficient intensity.\r\n\r\n974. On using a strong solution of caustic potassa in the vessel A, to\r\nexcite the current, it was found by the decomposing effects at _e_, that\r\nthe current passed. But it had not intensity enough to decompose the water\r\nin the vessel B; for though left for fourteen days, during the whole of\r\nwhich time the current was found to be passing, still not the slightest\r\nappearance of gas appeared on the plates P'P\", nor any other signs of the\r\nwater having suffered decomposition.\r\n\r\n975. Sulphate of soda in solution was then experimented with, for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining with respect to it, whether a certain electrolytic\r\nintensity was also required for its decomposition in this state, in analogy\r\nwith the result established with regard to water (974). The apparatus was\r\narranged as in fig. 85; P and Z are the platina and zinc plates dipping\r\ninto a solution of common salt; _a_ and _b_ are platina plates connected by\r\nwires of platina (except in the galvanometer _g_) with P and Z; _c_ is a\r\nconnecting wire of platina, the ends of which can be made to rest either on\r\nthe plates _a, b_, or on the papers moistened in solutions which are placed\r\nupon them; so that the passage of the current without decomposition, or\r\nwith one or two decompositions, was under ready command, as far as\r\narrangement was concerned. In order to change the _anodes_ and _cathodes_\r\nat the places of decomposition, the form of apparatus fig. 86, was\r\noccasionally adopted. Here only one platina plate, _c_, was used; both\r\npieces of paper on which decomposition was to be effected were placed upon\r\nit, the wires from P and Z resting upon these pieces of paper, or upon the\r\nplate _c_, according as the current with or without decomposition of the\r\nsolutions was required.\r\n\r\n976. On placing solution of iodide of potassium in paper at one of the\r\ndecomposing localities, and solution of sulphate of soda at the other, so\r\nthat the electric current should pass through both at once, the solution of\r\niodide was slowly decomposed, yielding iodine at the _anode_ and alkali at\r\nthe _cathode_; but the solution of sulphate of soda exhibited no signs of\r\ndecomposition, neither acid nor alkali being evolved from it. On placing\r\nthe wires so that the iodide alone was subject to the action of the current\r\n(900.), it was quickly and powerfully decomposed; but on arranging them so\r\nthat the sulphate of soda alone was subject to action, it still refused to\r\nyield up its elements. Finally, the apparatus was so arranged under a wet\r\nbell-glass, that it could be left for twelve hours, the current passing\r\nduring the whole time through a solution of sulphate of soda, retained in\r\nits place by only two thicknesses of bibulous litmus and turmeric paper. At\r\nthe end of that time it was ascertained by the decomposition of iodide of\r\npotassium at the second place of action, that the current was passing and\r\nhad passed for the twelve hours, and yet no trace of acid or alkali from\r\nthe sulphate of soda appeared.\r\n\r\n977. From these experiments it may, I think, be concluded, that a solution\r\nof sulphate of soda can conduct a current of electricity, which is unable\r\nto decompose the neutral salt present; that this salt in the state of\r\nsolution, like water, requires a certain electrolytic intensity for its\r\ndecomposition; and that the necessary intensity is much higher for this\r\nsubstance than for the iodide of potassium in a similar state of solution.\r\n\r\n978. I then experimented on bodies rendered decomposable by fusion, and\r\nfirst on _chloride of lead_. The current was excited by dilute sulphuric\r\nacid without any nitric acid between zinc and platina plates, fig. 87, and\r\nwas then made to traverse a little chloride of lead fused upon glass at\r\n_a_, a paper moistened in solution of iodide of potassium at _b_, and a\r\ngalvanometer at _g_. The metallic terminations at _a_ and _b_ were of\r\nplatina. Being thus arranged, the decomposition at _b_ and the deflection\r\nat _g_ showed that an electric current was passing, but there was no\r\nappearance of decomposition at _a_, not even after a _metallic_\r\ncommunication at _b_ was established. The experiment was repeated several\r\ntimes, and I am led to conclude that in this case the current has not\r\nintensity sufficient to cause the decomposition of the chloride of lead;\r\nand further, that, like water (974.), fused chloride of lead can conduct an\r\nelectric current having an intensity below that required to effect\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\n979. _Chloride of silver_ was then placed at _a_, fig. 87, instead of\r\nchloride of lead. There was a very ready decomposition of the solution of\r\niodide of potassium at _b_, and when metallic contact was made there, very\r\nconsiderable deflection of the galvanometer needle at _g_. Platina also\r\nappeared to be dissolved at the anode of the fused chloride at _a_, and\r\nthere was every appearance of a decomposition having been effected there.\r\n\r\n980. A further proof of decomposition was obtained in the following manner.\r\nThe platina wires in the fused chloride at _a_ were brought very near\r\ntogether (metallic contact having been established at _b_), and left so;\r\nthe deflection at the galvanometer indicated the passage of a current,\r\nfeeble in its force, but constant. After a minute or two, however, the\r\nneedle would suddenly be violently affected, and indicate a current as\r\nstrong as if metallic contact had taken place at _a_. This I actually found\r\nto be the case, for the silver reduced by the action of the current\r\ncrystallized in long delicate spiculæ, and these at last completed the\r\nmetallic communication; and at the same time that they transmitted a more\r\npowerful current than the fused chloride, they proved that electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition of that chloride had been going on. Hence it appears, that\r\nthe current excited by dilute sulphuric acid between zinc and platina, has\r\nan intensity above that required to electrolyze the fused chloride of\r\nsilver when placed between platina electrodes, although it has not\r\nintensity enough to decompose chloride of lead under the same\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n981. A drop of _water_ placed at _a_ instead of the fused chlorides, showed\r\nas in the former case (970.), that it could conduct a current unable to\r\ndecompose it, for decomposition of the solution of iodide at _b_ occurred\r\nafter some time. But its conducting power was much below that of the fused\r\nchloride of lead (978.).\r\n\r\n982. Fused _nitre_ at _a_ conducted much better than water: I was unable to\r\ndecide with certainty whether it was electrolyzed, but I incline to think\r\nnot, for there was no discoloration against the platina at the _cathode_.\r\nIf sulpho-nitric acid had been used in the exciting vessel, both the nitre\r\nand the chloride of lead would have suffered decomposition like the water\r\n(906.).\r\n\r\n983. The results thus obtained of conduction without decomposition, and the\r\nnecessity of a certain electrolytic intensity for the separation of the\r\n_ions_ of different electrolytes, are immediately connected with the\r\nexperiments and results given in § 10. of the Fourth Series of these\r\nResearches (418. 423. 444. 419.). But it will require a more exact\r\nknowledge of the nature of intensity, both as regards the first origin of\r\nthe electric current, and also the manner in which it may be reduced, or\r\nlowered by the intervention of longer or shorter portions of bad\r\nconductors, whether decomposable or not, before their relation can be\r\nminutely and fully understood.\r\n\r\n984. In the case of water, the experiments I have as yet made, appear to\r\nshow, that, when the electric current is reduced in intensity below the\r\npoint required for decomposition, then the degree of conduction is the same\r\nwhether sulphuric acid, or any other of the many bodies which can affect\r\nits transferring power as an electrolyte, are present or not. Or, in other\r\nwords, that the necessary electrolytic intensity for water is the same\r\nwhether it be pure, or rendered a better conductor by the addition of these\r\nsubstances; and that for currents of less intensity than this, the water,\r\nwhether pure or acidulated, has equal conducting power. An apparatus, fig.\r\n84, was arranged with dilute sulphuric acid in the vessel A, and pure\r\ndistilled water in the vessel B. By the decomposition at _c_, it appeared\r\nas if water was a _better_ conductor than dilute sulphuric acid for a\r\ncurrent of such low intensity as to cause no decomposition. I am inclined,\r\nhowever, to attribute this apparent superiority of water to variations in\r\nthat peculiar condition of the platina electrodes which is referred to\r\nfurther on in this Series (1040.), and which is assumed, as far as I can\r\njudge, to a greater degree in dilute sulphuric acid than in pure water. The\r\npower therefore, of acids, alkalies, salts, and other bodies in solution,\r\nto increase conducting power, appears to hold good only in those cases\r\nwhere the electrolyte subject to the current suffers decomposition, and\r\nloses all influence when the current transmitted has too low an intensity\r\nto affect chemical change. It is probable that the ordinary conducting\r\npower of an electrolyte in the solid state (419.) is the same as that which\r\nit possesses in the fluid state for currents, the tension of which is\r\nbeneath the due electrolytic intensity.\r\n\r\n985. Currents of electricity, produced by less than eight or ten series of\r\nvoltaic elements, can be reduced to that intensity at which water can\r\nconduct them without suffering decomposition, by causing them to pass\r\nthrough three or four vessels in which water shall be successively\r\ninterposed between platina surfaces. The principles of interference upon\r\nwhich this effect depends, will be described hereafter (1009. 1018.), but\r\nthe effect may be useful in obtaining currents of standard intensity, and\r\nis probably applicable to batteries of any number of pairs of plates.\r\n\r\n986. As there appears every reason to expect that all electrolytes will be\r\nfound subject to the law which requires an electric current of a certain\r\nintensity for their decomposition, but that they will differ from each\r\nother in the degree of intensity required, it will be desirable hereafter\r\nto arrange them in a table, in the order of their electrolytic intensities.\r\nInvestigations on this point must, however, be very much extended, and\r\ninclude many more bodies than have been here mentioned before such a table\r\ncan be constructed. It will be especially needful in such experiments, to\r\ndescribe the nature of the electrodes used, or, if possible, to select such\r\nas, like platina or plumbago in certain cases, shall have no power of\r\nassisting the separation of the _ions_ to be evolved (913).\r\n\r\n987. Of the two modes in which bodies can transmit the electric forces,\r\nnamely, that which is so characteristically exhibited by the metals, and\r\nusually called conduction, and that in which it is accompanied by\r\ndecomposition, the first appears common to all bodies, although it occurs\r\nwith almost infinite degrees of difference; the second is at present\r\ndistinctive of the electrolytes. It is, however, just possible that it may\r\nhereafter be extended to the metals; for their power of conducting without\r\ndecomposition may, perhaps justly, be ascribed to their requiring a very\r\nhigh electrolytic intensity for their decomposition.\r\n\r\n987-1/2. The establishment of the principle that a certain electrolytic\r\nintensity is necessary before decomposition can be effected, is of great\r\nimportance to all those considerations which arise regarding the probable\r\neffects of weak currents, such for instance as those produced by natural\r\nthermo-electricity, or natural voltaic arrangements in the earth. For to\r\nproduce an effect of decomposition or of combination, a current must not\r\nonly exist, but have a certain intensity before it can overcome the\r\nquiescent affinities opposed to it, otherwise it will be conducted,\r\nproducing no permanent chemical effects. On the other hand, the principles\r\nare also now evident by which an opposing action can be so weakened by the\r\njuxtaposition of bodies not having quite affinity enough to cause direct\r\naction between them (913.), that a very weak current shall be able to raise\r\nthe sum of actions sufficiently high, and cause chemical changes to occur.\r\n\r\n988. In concluding this division _on the intensity necessary for\r\nelectrolyzation_, I cannot resist pointing out the following remarkable\r\nconclusion in relation to intensity generally. It would appear that when a\r\nvoltaic current is produced, having a certain intensity, dependent upon the\r\nstrength of the chemical affinities by which that current is excited\r\n(916.), it can decompose a particular electrolyte without relation to the\r\nquantity of electricity passed, the _intensity_ deciding whether the\r\nelectrolyte shall give way or not. If that conclusion be confirmed, then we\r\nmay arrange circumstances so that the _same quantity_ of electricity may\r\npass in the _same time_, in at the _same surface_, into the _same\r\ndecomposing body in the same state_, and yet, differing in intensity, will\r\n_decompose in one case and in the other not_:--for taking a source of too\r\nlow an intensity to decompose, and ascertaining the quantity passed in a\r\ngiven time, it is easy to take another source having a sufficient\r\nintensity, and reducing the quantity of electricity from it by the\r\nintervention of bad conductors to the same proportion as the former\r\ncurrent, and then all the conditions will be fulfilled which are required\r\nto produce the result described.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ iii. _On associated Voltaic Circles, or the Voltaic Battery._\r\n\r\n989. Passing from the consideration of single circles (875. &c.) to their\r\nassociation in the voltaic battery, it is a very evident consequence, that\r\nif matters are so arranged that two sets of affinities, in place of being\r\nopposed to each other as in figg. 73. 76. (880. 891.), are made to act in\r\nconformity, then, instead of either interfering with the other, it will\r\nrather assist it. This is simply the case of two voltaic pairs of metals\r\narranged so as to form one circuit. In such arrangements the activity of\r\nthe whole is known to be increased, and when ten, or a hundred, or any\r\nlarger number of such alternations are placed in conformable association\r\nwith each other, the power of the whole becomes proportionally exalted, and\r\nwe obtain that magnificent instrument of philosophic research, the _voltaic\r\nbattery_.\r\n\r\n990. But it is evident from the principles of definite action already laid\r\ndown, that the _quantity_ of electricity in the current cannot be increased\r\nwith the increase of the _quantity of metal_ oxidized and dissolved at each\r\nnew place of chemical action. A single pair of zinc and platina plates\r\nthrows as much electricity into the form of a current, by the oxidation of\r\n32.5 grains of the zinc (868.) as would be circulated by the same\r\nalteration of a thousand times that quantity, or nearly five pounds of\r\nmetal oxidized at the surface of the zinc plates of a thousand pairs placed\r\nin regular battery order. For it is evident, that the electricity which\r\npasses across the acid from the zinc to the platina in the first cell, and\r\nwhich has been associated with, or even evolved by, the decomposition of a\r\ndefinite portion of water in that cell, cannot pass from the zinc to the\r\nplatina across the acid in the second cell, without the decomposition of\r\nthe same quantity of water there, and the oxidation of the same quantity of\r\nzinc by it (924. 949.). The same result recurs in every other cell; the\r\nelectro-chemical equivalent of water must be decomposed in each, before the\r\ncurrent can pass through it; for the quantity of electricity passed and the\r\nquantity of electrolyte decomposed, _must_ be the equivalents of each\r\nother. The action in each cell, therefore, is not to increase the quantity\r\nset in motion in any one cell, but to aid in urging forward that quantity,\r\nthe passing of which is consistent with the oxidation of its own zinc; and\r\nin this way it exalts that peculiar property of the current which we\r\nendeavour to express by the term _intensity_, without increasing the\r\n_quantity_ beyond that which is proportionate to the quantity of zinc\r\noxidized in any single cell of the series.\r\n\r\n991. To prove this, I arranged ten pairs of amalgamated zinc and platina\r\nplates with dilute sulphuric acid in the form of a battery. On completing\r\nthe circuit, all the pairs acted and evolved gas at the surfaces of the\r\nplatina. This was collected and found to be alike in quantity for each\r\nplate; and the quantity of hydrogen evolved at any one platina plate was in\r\nthe same proportion to the quantity of metal dissolved from any one zinc\r\nplate, as was given in the experiment with a single pair (864. &c.). It was\r\ntherefore certain, that, just as much electricity and no more had passed\r\nthrough the series of ten pair of plates as had passed through, or would\r\nhave been put into motion by, any single pair, notwithstanding that ten\r\ntimes the quantity of zinc had been consumed.\r\n\r\n992. This truth has been proved also long ago in another way, by the action\r\nof the evolved current on a magnetic needle; the deflecting power of one\r\npair of plates in a battery being equal to the deflecting power of the\r\nwhole, provided the wires used be sufficiently large to carry the current\r\nof the single pair freely; but the _cause_ of this equality of action could\r\nnot be understood whilst the definite action and evolution of electricity\r\n(783. 869.) remained unknown.\r\n\r\n993. The superior decomposing power of a battery over a single pair of\r\nplates is rendered evident in two ways. Electrolytes held together by an\r\naffinity so strong as to resist the action of the current from a single\r\npair, yield up their elements to the current excited by many pairs; and\r\nthat body which is decomposed by the action of one or of few pairs of\r\nmetals, &c., is resolved into its _ions_ the more readily as it is acted\r\nupon by electricity urged forward by many alternations.\r\n\r\n994. Both these effects are, I think, easily understood. Whatever\r\n_intensity_ may be, (and that must of course depend upon the nature of\r\nelectricity, whether it consist of a fluid or fluids, or of vibrations of\r\nan ether, or any other kind or condition of matter,) there seems to be no\r\ndifficulty in comprehending that the _degree_ of intensity at which a\r\ncurrent of electricity is evolved by a first voltaic element, shall be\r\nincreased when that current is subjected to the action of a second voltaic\r\nelement, acting in conformity and possessing equal powers with the first:\r\nand as the decompositions are merely opposed actions, but exactly of the\r\nsame kind as those which generate the current (917.), it seems to be a\r\nnatural consequence, that the affinity which can resist the force of a\r\nsingle decomposing action may be unable to oppose the energies of many\r\ndecomposing actions, operating conjointly, as in the voltaic battery.\r\n\r\n995. That a body which can give way to a current of feeble intensity,\r\nshould give way more freely to one of stronger force, and yet involve no\r\ncontradiction to the law of definite electrolytic action, is perfectly\r\nconsistent. All the facts and also the theory I have ventured to put forth,\r\ntend to show that the act of decomposition opposes a certain force to the\r\npassage of the electric current; and, that this obstruction should be\r\novercome more or less readily, in proportion to the greater or less\r\nintensity of the decomposing current, is in perfect consistency with all\r\nour notions of the electric agent.\r\n\r\n996. I have elsewhere (947.) distinguished the chemical action of zinc and\r\ndilute sulphuric acid into two portions; that which, acting effectually on\r\nthe zinc, evolves hydrogen at once upon its surface, and that which,\r\nproducing an arrangement of the chemical forces throughout the electrolyte\r\npresent, (in this case water,) tends to take oxygen from it, but cannot do\r\nso unless the electric current consequent thereon can have free passage,\r\nand the hydrogen be delivered elsewhere than against the zinc. The electric\r\ncurrent depends altogether upon the second of these; but when the current\r\ncan pass, by favouring the electrolytic action it tends to diminish the\r\nformer and increase the latter portion.\r\n\r\n997. It is evident, therefore, that when ordinary zinc is used in a voltaic\r\narrangement, there is an enormous waste of that power which it is the\r\nobject to throw into the form of an electric current; a consequence which\r\nis put in its strongest point of view when it is considered that three\r\nounces and a half of zinc, properly oxidized, can circulate enough\r\nelectricity to decompose nearly one ounce of water, and cause the evolution\r\nof about 2100 cubic inches of hydrogen gas. This loss of power not only\r\ntakes place during the time the electrodes of the battery are in\r\ncommunication, being then proportionate to the quantity of hydrogen evolved\r\nagainst the surface of any one of the zinc plates, but includes also _all_\r\nthe chemical action which goes on when the extremities of the pile are not\r\nin communication.\r\n\r\n998. This loss is far greater with ordinary zinc than with the pure metal,\r\nas M. De la Rive has shown[A]. The cause is, that when ordinary zinc is\r\nacted upon by dilute sulphuric acid, portions of copper, lead, cadmium, or\r\nother metals which it may contain, are set free upon its surface; and\r\nthese, being in contact with the zinc, form small but very active voltaic\r\ncircles, which cause great destruction of the zinc and evolution of\r\nhydrogen, apparently upon the zinc surface, but really upon the surface of\r\nthese incidental metals. In the same proportion as they serve to discharge\r\nor convey the electricity back to the zinc, do they diminish its power of\r\nproducing an electric current which shall extend to a greater distance\r\nacross the acid, and be discharged only through the copper or platina plate\r\nwhich is associated with it for the purpose of forming a voltaic apparatus.\r\n\r\n  [A] Quarterly Journal of Science, 1831, p. 388; or Bibliothèque\r\n  Universelle, 1830, p. 391.\r\n\r\n999. All these evils are removed by the employment of an amalgam of zinc in\r\nthe manner recommended by Mr. Kemp[A], or the use of the amalgamated zinc\r\nplates of Mr. Sturgeon (863.), who has himself suggested and objected to\r\ntheir application in galvanic batteries; for he says, \"Were it not on\r\naccount of the brittleness and other inconveniences occasioned by the\r\nincorporation of the mercury with the zinc, amalgamation of the zinc\r\nsurfaces in galvanic batteries would become an important improvement; for\r\nthe metal would last much longer, and remain bright for a considerable\r\ntime, even for several successive hours; essential considerations in the\r\nemployment of this apparatus[B].\"\r\n\r\n  [A] Jameson's Edinburgh Journal, October 1828.\r\n\r\n  [B] Recent Experimental Researches, p. 42, &c. Mr. Sturgeon is of\r\n  course unaware of the definite production of electricity by chemical\r\n  action, and is in fact quoting the experiment as the strongest\r\n  argument _against_ the chemical theory of galvanism.\r\n\r\n1000. Zinc so prepared, even though impure, does not sensibly decompose the\r\nwater of dilute sulphuric acid, but still has such affinity for the oxygen,\r\nthat the moment a metal which, like copper or platina, has little or no\r\naffinity, touches it in the acid, action ensues, and a powerful and\r\nabundant electric current is produced. It is probable that the mercury acts\r\nby bringing the surface, in consequence of its fluidity, into one uniform\r\ncondition, and preventing those differences in character between one spot\r\nand another which are necessary for the formation of the minute voltaic\r\ncircuits referred to (998.). If any difference does exist at the first\r\nmoment, with regard to the proportion of zinc and mercury, at one spot on\r\nthe _surface_, as compared with another, that spot having the least mercury\r\nis first acted on, and, by solution of the zinc, is soon placed in the same\r\ncondition as the other parts, and the whole plate rendered superficially\r\nuniform. One part cannot, therefore, act as a discharger to another; and\r\nhence _all_ the chemical power upon the water at its surface is in that\r\nequable condition (949.), which, though it tends to produce an electric\r\ncurrent through the liquid to another plate of metal which can act as a\r\ndischarger (950.), presents no irregularities by which any one part, having\r\nweaker affinities for oxygen, can act as a discharger to another. Two\r\nexcellent and important consequences follow upon this state of the metal.\r\nThe first is, that _the full equivalent_ of electricity is obtained for the\r\noxidation of a certain quantity of zinc; the second, that a battery\r\nconstructed with the zinc so prepared, and charged with dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, is active only whilst the electrodes are connected, and ceases to act\r\nor be acted upon by the acid the instant the communication is broken.\r\n\r\n1001. I have had a small battery of ten pairs of plates thus constructed,\r\nand am convinced that arrangements of this kind will be very important,\r\nespecially in the development and illustration of the philosophical\r\nprinciples of the instrument. The metals I have used are amalgamated zinc\r\nand platina, connected together by being soldered to platina wires, the\r\nwhole apparatus having the form of the couronne des tasses. The liquid used\r\nwas dilute sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1.25. No action took place upon the\r\nmetals except when the electrodes were in communication, and then the\r\naction upon the zinc was only in proportion to the decomposition in the\r\nexperimental cell; for when the current was retarded there, it was retarded\r\nalso in the battery, and no waste of the powers of the metal was incurred.\r\n\r\n1002. In consequence of this circumstance, the acid in the cells remained\r\nactive for a very much longer time than usual. In fact, time did not tend\r\nto lower it in any sensible degree: for whilst the metal was preserved to\r\nbe acted upon at the proper moment, the acid also was preserved almost at\r\nits first strength. Hence a constancy of action far beyond what can be\r\nobtained by the use of common zinc.\r\n\r\n1003. Another excellent consequence was the renewal, during the interval of\r\nrest, between two experiments of the first and most efficient state. When\r\nan amalgamated zinc and a platina plate, immersed in dilute sulphuric acid,\r\nare first connected, the current is very powerful, but instantly sinks very\r\nmuch in force, and in some cases actually falls to only an eighth or a\r\ntenth of that first produced (1036.). This is due to the acid which is in\r\ncontact with the zinc becoming neutralized by the oxide formed; the\r\ncontinued quick oxidation of the metal being thus prevented. With ordinary\r\nzinc, the evolution of gas at its surface tends to mingle all the liquid\r\ntogether, and thus bring fresh acid against the metal, by which the oxide\r\nformed there can be removed. With the amalgamated zinc battery, at every\r\ncessation of the current, the saline solution against the zinc is gradually\r\ndiffused amongst the rest of the liquid; and upon the renewal of contact at\r\nthe electrodes, the zinc plates are found most favourably circumstanced for\r\nthe production of a ready and powerful current.\r\n\r\n1004. It might at first be imagined that amalgamated zinc would be much\r\ninferior in force to common zinc, because, of the lowering of its energy,\r\nwhich the mercury might be supposed to occasion over the whole of its\r\nsurface; but this is not the case. When the electric currents of two pairs\r\nof platina and zinc plates were opposed, the difference being that one of\r\nthe zincs was amalgamated and the other not, the current from the\r\namalgamated zinc was most powerful, although no gas was evolved against it,\r\nand much was evolved at the surface of the unamalgamated metal. Again, as\r\nDavy has shown[A], if amalgamated and unamalgamated zinc be put in contact,\r\nand dipped into dilute sulphuric acid, or other exciting fluids, the former\r\nis positive to the latter, i.e. the current passes from the amalgamated\r\nzinc, through the fluid, to the unprepared zinc. This he accounts for by\r\nsupposing that \"there is not any inherent and specific property in each\r\nmetal which gives it the electrical character, but that it depends upon its\r\npeculiar state--on that form of aggregation which fits it for chemical\r\nchange.\"\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1826, p. 405.\r\n\r\n1005. The superiority of the amalgamated zinc is not, however, due to any\r\nsuch cause, but is a very simple consequence of the state of the fluid in\r\ncontact with it; for as the unprepared zinc acts directly and alone upon\r\nthe fluid, whilst that which is amalgamated does not, the former (by the\r\noxide it produces) quickly neutralizes the acid in contact with its\r\nsurface, so that the progress of oxidation is retarded, whilst at the\r\nsurface of the amalgamated zinc, any oxide formed is instantly removed by\r\nthe free acid present, and the clean metallic surface is always ready to\r\nact with full energy upon the water. Hence its superiority (1037.).\r\n1006. The progress of improvement in the voltaic battery and its\r\napplications, is evidently in the contrary direction at present to what it\r\nwas a few years ago; for in place of increasing the number of plates, the\r\nstrength of acid, and the extent altogether of the instrument, the change\r\nis rather towards its first state of simplicity, but with a far more\r\nintimate knowledge and application of the principles which govern its force\r\nand action. Effects of decomposition can now be obtained with ten pairs of\r\nplates (417.), which required five hundred or a thousand pairs for their\r\nproduction in the first instance. The capability of decomposing fused\r\nchlorides, iodides, and other compounds, according to the law before\r\nestablished (380. &c.), and the opportunity of collecting certain of the\r\nproducts, without any loss, by the use of apparatus of the nature of those\r\nalready described (789. 814. &c.), render it probable that the voltaic\r\nbattery may become a useful and even economical manufacturing instrument;\r\nfor theory evidently indicates that an equivalent of a rare substance may\r\nbe obtained at the expense of three or four equivalents of a very common\r\nbody, namely, zinc: and practice seems thus far to justify the expectation.\r\nIn this point of view I think it very likely that plates of platina or\r\nsilver may be used instead of plates of copper with advantage, and that\r\nthen the evil arising occasionally from solution of the copper, and its\r\nprecipitation on the zinc, (by which the electromotive power of the zinc is\r\nso much injured,) will be avoided (1047.).\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ iv. _On the Resistance of an Electrolyte to Electrolytic Action, and on\r\nInterpositions._\r\n\r\n1007. I have already illustrated, in the simplest possible form of\r\nexperiment (891. 910.), the resistance established at the place of\r\ndecomposition to the force active at the exciting place. I purpose\r\nexamining the effects of this resistance more generally; but it is rather\r\nwith reference to their practical interference with the action and\r\nphenomena of the voltaic battery, than with any intention at this time to\r\noffer a strict and philosophical account of their nature. Their general and\r\nprincipal cause is the resistance of the chemical affinities to be\r\novercome; but there are numerous other circumstances which have a joint\r\ninfluence with these forces (1034. 1040. &c.), each of which would require\r\na minute examination before a correct account of the whole could be given.\r\n\r\n1008. As it will be convenient to describe the experiments in a form\r\ndifferent to that in which they were made, both forms shall first be\r\nexplained. Plates of platina, copper, zinc, and other metals, about three\r\nquarters of an inch wide and three inches long, were associated together in\r\npairs by means of platina wires to which they were soldered, fig. 88, the\r\nplates of one pair being either alike or different, as might be required.\r\nThese were arranged in glasses, fig. 89, so as to form Volta's crown of\r\ncups. The acid or fluid in the cups never covered the whole of any plate;\r\nand occasionally small glass rods were put into the cups, between the\r\nplates, to prevent their contact. Single plates were used to terminate the\r\nseries and complete the connexion with a galvanometer, or with a\r\ndecomposing apparatus (899. 968. &c.), or both. Now if fig. 90 be examined\r\nand compared with fig. 91, the latter may be admitted as representing the\r\nformer in its simplest condition; for the cups i, ii, and iii of the\r\nformer, with their contents, are represented by the cells i, ii, and iii of\r\nthe latter, and the metal plates Z and P of the former by the similar\r\nplates represented Z and P in the latter. The only difference, in fact,\r\nbetween the apparatus, fig. 90, and the trough represented fig. 91, is that\r\ntwice the quantity of surface of contact between the metal and acid is\r\nallowed in the first to what would occur in the second.\r\n\r\n1009. When the extreme plates of the arrangement just described, fig. 90,\r\nare connected metallically through the galvanometer _g_, then the whole\r\nrepresents a battery consisting of two pairs of zinc and platina plates\r\nurging a current forward, which has, however, to decompose water unassisted\r\nby any direct chemical affinity before it can be transmitted across the\r\ncell iii, and therefore before it can circulate. This decomposition of\r\nwater, which is opposed to the passage of the current, may, as a matter of\r\nconvenience, be considered as taking place either against the surfaces of\r\nthe two platina plates which constitute the electrodes in the cell in, or\r\nagainst the two surfaces of that platina plate which separates the cells ii\r\nand iii, fig. 91, from each other. It is evident that if that plate were\r\naway, the battery would consist of two pairs of plates and two cells,\r\narranged in the most favourable position for the production of a current.\r\nThe platina plate therefore, which being introduced as at _x_, has oxygen\r\nevolved at one surface and hydrogen at the other (that is, if the\r\ndecomposing current passes), may be considered as the cause of any\r\nobstruction arising from the decomposition of water by the electrolytic\r\naction of the current; and I have usually called it the interposed plate.\r\n\r\n1010. In order to simplify the conditions, dilute sulphuric acid was first\r\nused in all the cells, and platina for the interposed plates; for then the\r\ninitial intensity of the current which tends to be formed is constant,\r\nbeing due to the power which zinc has of decomposing water; and the\r\nopposing force of decomposition is also constant, the elements of the water\r\nbeing unassisted in their separation at the interposed plates by any\r\naffinity or secondary action at the electrodes (744.), arising either from\r\nthe nature of the plate itself or the surrounding fluid.\r\n\r\n1011. When only one voltaic pair of zinc and platina plates was used, the\r\ncurrent of electricity was entirely stopped to all practical purposes by\r\ninterposing one platina plate, fig. 92, i.e. by requiring of the current\r\nthat it should decompose water, and evolve both its elements, before it\r\nshould pass. This consequence is in perfect accordance with the views\r\nbefore given (910. 917. 973.). For as the whole result depends upon the\r\nopposition of forces at the places of electric excitement and\r\nelectro-decomposition, and as water is the substance to be decomposed at\r\nboth before the current can move, it is not to be expected that the zinc\r\nshould have such powerful attraction for the oxygen, as not only to be able\r\nto take it from its associated hydrogen, but leave such a surplus of force\r\nas, passing to the second place of decomposition, should be there able to\r\neffect a second separation of the elements of water. Such an effect would\r\nrequire that the force of attraction between zinc and oxygen should under\r\nthe circumstances be _at least_ twice as great as the force of attraction\r\nbetween the oxygen and hydrogen.\r\n\r\n1012. When two pairs of zinc and platina exciting plates were used, the\r\ncurrent was also practically stopped by one interposed platina plate, fig.\r\n93. There was a very feeble effect of a current at first, but it ceased\r\nalmost immediately. It will be referred to, with many other similar\r\neffects, hereafter (1017.).\r\n\r\n1013. Three pairs of zinc and platina plates, fig. 94, were able to produce\r\na current which could pass an interposed platina plate, and effect the\r\nelectrolyzation of water in cell iv. The current was evident, both by the\r\ncontinued deflection of the galvanometer, and the production of bubbles of\r\noxygen and hydrogen at the electrodes in cell iv. Hence the accumulated\r\nsurplus force of three plates of zinc, which are active in decomposing\r\nwater, is more than equal, when added together, to the force with which\r\noxygen and hydrogen are combined in water, and is sufficient to cause the\r\nseparation of these elements from each other.\r\n\r\n1014. The three pairs of zinc and platina plates were now opposed by two\r\nintervening platina plates, fig. 95. In this case the current was stopped.\r\n\r\n1015. Four pairs of zinc and platina plates were also neutralized by two\r\ninterposed platina plates, fig. 96.\r\n\r\n1016. Five pairs of zinc and platina, with two interposed platina plates,\r\nfig. 97, gave a feeble current; there was permanent deflection at the\r\ngalvanometer, and decomposition in the cells vi and vii. But the current\r\nwas very feeble; very much less than when all the intermediate plates were\r\nremoved and the two extreme ones only retained: for when they were placed\r\nsix inches asunder in one cell, they gave a powerful current. Hence five\r\nexciting pairs, with two interposed obstructing plates, do not give a\r\ncurrent at all comparable to that of a single unobstructed pair.\r\n\r\n1017. I have already said that a _very feeble current_ passed when the\r\nseries included one interposed platina and two pairs of zinc and platina\r\nplates (1012.). A similarly feeble current passed in every case, and even\r\nwhen only one exciting pair and four intervening platina plates were used,\r\nfig. 98, a current passed which could be detected at _x_, both by chemical\r\naction on the solution of iodide of potassium, and by the galvanometer.\r\nThis current I believe to be due to electricity reduced in intensity below\r\nthe point requisite for the decomposition of water (970. 984.); for water\r\ncan conduct electricity of such low intensity by the same kind of power\r\nwhich it possesses in common with metals and charcoal, though it cannot\r\nconduct electricity of higher intensity without suffering decomposition,\r\nand then opposing a new force consequent thereon. With an electric current\r\nof, or under this intensity, it is probable that increasing the number of\r\ninterposed platina plates would not involve an increased difficulty of\r\nconduction.\r\n\r\n1018. In order to obtain an idea of the additional interfering power of\r\neach added platina plate, six voltaic pairs and four intervening platinas\r\nwere arranged as in fig. 99; a very feeble current then passed (985.\r\n1017.). When one of the platinas was removed so that three intervened, a\r\ncurrent somewhat stronger passed. With two intervening platinas a still\r\nstronger current passed; and with only one intervening platina a very fair\r\ncurrent was obtained. But the effect of the successive plates, taken in the\r\norder of their interposition, was very different, as might be expected; for\r\nthe first retarded the current more powerfully than the second, and the\r\nsecond more than the third.\r\n\r\n1019. In these experiments both amalgamated and unamalgamated zinc were\r\nused, but the results generally were the same.\r\n\r\n1020. The effects of retardation just described were altered altogether\r\nwhen changes were made in the _nature of the liquid_ used between the\r\nplates, either in what may be called the _exciting_ or the _retarding_\r\ncells. Thus, retaining the exciting force the same, by still using pure\r\ndilute sulphuric acid for that purpose, if a little nitric acid were added\r\nto the liquid in the _retarding_ cells, then the transmission of the\r\ncurrent was very much facilitated. For instance, in the experiment with one\r\npair of exciting plates and one intervening plate (1011.), fig. 92, when a\r\nfew drops of nitric acid were added to the contents of cell ii, then the\r\ncurrent of electricity passed with considerable strength (though it soon\r\nfell from other causes (1036; 1040.),) and the same increased effect was\r\nproduced by the nitric acid when many interposed plates were used.\r\n\r\n1021. This seems to be a consequence of the diminution of the difficulty of\r\ndecomposing water when its hydrogen, instead of being absolutely expelled,\r\nas in the former cases, is transferred to the oxygen of the nitric acid,\r\nproducing a secondary result at the _cathode_ (752.); for in accordance\r\nwith the chemical views of the electric current and its action already\r\nadvanced (913.), the water, instead of opposing a resistance to\r\ndecomposition equal to the full amount of the force of mutual attraction\r\nbetween its oxygen and hydrogen, has that force counteracted in part, and\r\ntherefore diminished by the attraction of the hydrogen at the _cathode_ for\r\nthe oxygen of the nitric acid which surrounds it, and with which it\r\nultimately combines instead of being evolved in its free state.\r\n\r\n1022. When a little nitric acid was put into the exciting cells, then again\r\nthe circumstances favouring the transmission of the current were\r\nstrengthened, for the _intensity_ of the current itself was increased by\r\nthe addition (906.). When therefore a little nitric acid was added to both\r\nthe _exciting_ and the _retarding_ cells, the current of electricity passed\r\nwith very considerable freedom.\r\n\r\n1023. When dilute muriatic acid was used, it produced and transmitted a\r\ncurrent more easily than pure dilute sulphuric acid, but not so readily as\r\ndilute nitric acid. As muriatic acid appears to be decomposed more freely\r\nthan water (765.), and as the affinity of zinc for chlorine is very\r\npowerful, it might be expected to produce a current more intense than that\r\nfrom the use of dilute sulphuric acid; and also to transmit it more freely\r\nby undergoing decomposition at a lower intensity (912.).\r\n\r\n1024. In relation to the effect of these interpositions, it is necessary to\r\nstate that they do not appear to be at all dependent upon the size of the\r\nelectrodes, or their distance from each other in the acid, except that when\r\na current _can pass_, changes in these facilitate or retard its passage.\r\nFor on repeating the experiment with one intervening and one pair of\r\nexciting plates (1011.), fig. 92, and in place of the interposed plate P\r\nusing sometimes a mere wire, and sometimes very large plates (1008.), and\r\nalso changing the terminal exciting plates Z and P, so that they were\r\nsometimes wires only and at others of great size, still the results were\r\nthe same as those already obtained.\r\n\r\n1025. In illustration of the effect of distance, an experiment like that\r\ndescribed with two exciting pairs and one intervening plate (1012.), fig.\r\n93, was arranged so that the distance between the plates in the third cell\r\ncould be increased to six or eight inches, or diminished to the thickness\r\nof a piece of intervening bibulous paper. Still the result was the same in\r\nboth cases, the effect not being sensibly greater, when the plates were\r\nmerely separated by the paper, than when a great way apart; so that the\r\nprincipal opposition to the current in this case does not depend upon the\r\n_quantity_ of intervening electrolytic conductor, but on the _relation of\r\nits elements to the intensity of the current_, or to the chemical nature of\r\nthe electrodes and the surrounding fluids.\r\n\r\n1026. When the acid was sulphuric acid, _increasing its strength_ in any of\r\nthe cells, caused no change in the effects; it did not produce a more\r\nintense current in the exciting cells (908.), or cause the current produced\r\nto traverse the decomposing cells more freely. But if to very weak\r\nsulphuric acid a few drops of nitric acid were added, then either one or\r\nother of those effects could be produced; and, as might be expected in a\r\ncase like this, where the exciting or conducting action bore a _direct_\r\nreference to the acid itself, increasing the strength of this (the nitric\r\nacid), also increased its powers.\r\n\r\n1027. The _nature of the interposed plate_ was now varied to show its\r\nrelation to the phenomena either of excitation or retardation, and\r\namalgamated zinc was first substituted for platina. On employing one\r\nvoltaic pair and one interposed zinc plate, fig. 100, there was as powerful\r\na current, apparently, as if the interposed zinc plate was away. Hydrogen\r\nwas evolved against P in cell ii, and against the side of the second zinc\r\nin cell i; but no gas appeared against the side of the zinc in cell ii, nor\r\nagainst the zinc in cell i.\r\n\r\n1028. On interposing two amalgamated zinc plates, fig. 101, instead of one,\r\nthere was still a powerful current, but interference had taken place. On\r\nusing three intermediate zinc plates, fig. 102, there was still further\r\nretardation, though a good current of electricity passed.\r\n\r\n1029. Considering the retardation as due to the inaction of the amalgamated\r\nzinc upon the dilute acid, in consequence of the slight though general\r\neffect of diminished chemical power produced by the mercury on the surface,\r\nand viewing this inaction as the circumstance which rendered it necessary\r\nthat each plate should have its tendency to decompose water assisted\r\nslightly by the electric current, it was expected that plates of the metal\r\nin the unamalgamated state would probably not require such assistance, and\r\nwould offer no sensible impediment to the passing of the current. This\r\nexpectation was fully realized in the use of two and three interposed\r\nunamalgamated plates. The electric current passed through them as freely as\r\nif there had been no such plates in the way. They offered no obstacle,\r\nbecause they could decompose water without the current; and the latter had\r\nonly to give direction to a part of the forces, which would have been\r\nactive whether it had passed or not.\r\n\r\n1030. Interposed plates of copper were then employed. These seemed at first\r\nto occasion no obstruction, but after a few minutes the current almost\r\nentirely ceased. This effect appears due to the surfaces taking up that\r\npeculiar condition (1010.) by which they tend to produce a reverse current;\r\nfor when one or more of the plates were turned round, which could easily be\r\neffected with the couronne des tasses form of experiment, fig. 90, then the\r\ncurrent was powerfully renewed for a few moments, and then again ceased.\r\nPlates of platina and copper, arranged as a voltaic pile with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, could not form a voltaic trough competent to act for more\r\nthan a _few_ minutes, because of this peculiar counteracting effect.\r\n\r\n1031. All these effects of retardation, exhibited by decomposition against\r\nsurfaces for which the evolved elements have more or less affinity, or are\r\naltogether deficient in attraction, show generally, though beautifully, the\r\nchemical relations and source of the current, and also the balanced state\r\nof the affinities at the places of excitation and decomposition. In this\r\nway they add to the mass of evidence in favour of the identity of the two;\r\nfor they demonstrate, as it were, the antagonism of the _chemical powers_\r\nat the electromotive part with the _chemical powers_ at the interposed\r\nparts; they show that the first are _producing_ electric effects, and the\r\nsecond _opposing_ them; they bring the two into direct relation; they prove\r\nthat either can determine the other, thus making what appears to be cause\r\nand effect convertible, and thereby demonstrating that both chemical and\r\nelectrical action are merely two exhibitions of one single agent or power\r\n(916. &c.).\r\n\r\n1032. It is quite evident, that as water and other electrolytes can conduct\r\nelectricity without suffering decomposition (986.), when the electricity is\r\nof sufficiently low intensity, it may not be asserted as absolutely true in\r\nall cases, that whenever electricity passes through an electrolyte, it\r\nproduces a definite effect of decomposition. But the quantity of\r\nelectricity which can pass in a given time through an electrolyte without\r\ncausing decomposition, is so small as to bear no comparison to that\r\nrequired in a case of very moderate decomposition, and with electricity\r\nabove the intensity required for electrolyzation, I have found no sensible\r\ndeparture as yet from the law of _definite electrolytic action_ developed\r\nin the preceding series of these Researches (783. &c.).\r\n\r\n1033. I cannot dismiss this division of the present Paper without making a\r\nreference to the important experiments of M. Aug. De la Rive on the effects\r\nof interposed plates[A]. As I have had occasion to consider such plates\r\nmerely as giving rise to new decompositions, and in that way only causing\r\nobstruction to the passage of the electric current, I was freed from the\r\nnecessity of considering the peculiar effects described by that\r\nphilosopher. I was the more willing to avoid for the present touching upon\r\nthese, as I must at the same time have entered into the views of Sir\r\nHumphry Davy upon the same subject[B] and also those of Marianini[C] and\r\nHitter[D], which are connected with it.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, tom. xxviii. p 190; and Mémoires de Génève.\r\n\r\n  [B] Philosophical Transactions, 1826, p. 413.\r\n\r\n  [C] Annales de Chimie, tom. xxxiii. pp. 117, 119, &c.\r\n\r\n  [D] Journal de Physique, tom. lvii. pp. 319, 350.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ v. _General Remarks on the active Voltaic Battery._\r\n\r\n1034. When the ordinary voltaic battery is brought into action, its very\r\nactivity produces certain effects, which re-act upon it, and cause serious\r\ndeterioration of its power. These render it an exceedingly inconstant\r\ninstrument as to the _quantity_ of effect which it is capable of producing.\r\nThey are already, in part, known and understood; but as their importance,\r\nand that of certain other coincident results, will be more evident by\r\nreference to the principles and experiments already stated and described, I\r\nhave thought it would be useful, in this investigation of the voltaic pile,\r\nto notice them briefly here.\r\n\r\n1035. When the battery is in action, it causes such substances to be formed\r\nand arranged in contact with the plates as very much weaken its power, or\r\neven tend to produce a counter current. They are considered by Sir Humphry\r\nDavy as sufficient to account for the phenomena of Ritter's secondary\r\npiles, and also for the effects observed by M.A. De la Rive with interposed\r\nplatina plates[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1826, p. 113.\r\n\r\n1036. I have already referred to this consequence (1003.), as capable, in\r\nsome cases, of lowering the force of the current to one-eighth or one-tenth\r\nof what it was at the first moment, and have met with instances in which\r\nits interference was very great. In an experiment in which one voltaic pair\r\nand one interposed platina plate were used with dilute sulphuric acid in\r\nthe cells fig. 103, the wires of communication were so arranged, that the\r\nend of that marked 3 could be placed at pleasure upon paper moistened in\r\nthe solution of iodide of potassium at _x_, or directly upon the platina\r\nplate there. If, after an interval during which the circuit had not been\r\ncomplete, the wire 3 were placed upon the paper, there was evidence of a\r\ncurrent, decomposition ensued, and the galvanometer was affected. If the\r\nwire 3 were made to touch the metal of _p_, a comparatively strong sudden\r\ncurrent was produced, affecting the galvanometer, but lasting only for a\r\nmoment; the effect at the galvanometer ceased, and if the wire 3 were\r\nplaced on the paper at _x_, no signs of decomposition occurred. On raising\r\nthe wire 3, and breaking the circuit altogether for a while, the apparatus\r\nresumed its first power, requiring, however, from five to ten minutes for\r\nthis purpose; and then, as before, on making contact between 3 and _p_,\r\nthere was again a momentary current, and immediately all the effects\r\napparently ceased.\r\n\r\n1037. This effect I was ultimately able to refer to the state of the film\r\nof fluid in contact with the zinc plate in cell i. The acid of that film is\r\ninstantly neutralized by the oxide formed; the oxidation of the zinc\r\ncannot, of course, go on with the same facility as before; and the chemical\r\naction being thus interrupted, the voltaic action diminishes with it. The\r\ntime of the rest was required for the diffusion of the liquid, and its\r\nreplacement by other acid. From the serious influence of this cause in\r\nexperiments with single pairs of plates of different metals, in which I was\r\nat one time engaged, and the extreme care required to avoid it, I cannot\r\nhelp feeling a strong suspicion that it interferes more frequently and\r\nextensively than experimenters are aware of, and therefore direct their\r\nattention to it.\r\n\r\n1038. In considering the effect in delicate experiments of this source of\r\nirregularity of action, in the voltaic apparatus, it must be remembered\r\nthat it is only that very small portion of matter which is directly in\r\ncontact with the oxidizable metal which has to be considered with reference\r\nto the change of its nature; and this portion is not very readily displaced\r\nfrom its position upon the surface of the metal (582. 605.), especially if\r\nthat metal be rough and irregular. In illustration of this effect, I will\r\nquote a remarkable experiment. A burnished platina plate (569.) was put\r\ninto hot strong sulphuric acid for an instant only: it was then put into\r\ndistilled water, moved about in it, taken out, and wiped dry: it was put\r\ninto a second portion of distilled water, moved about in it, and again\r\nwiped: it was put into a third portion of distilled water, in which it was\r\nmoved about for nearly eight seconds; it was then, without wiping, put into\r\na fourth portion of distilled water, where it was allowed to remain five\r\nminutes. The two latter portions of water were then tested for sulphuric\r\nacid; the third gave no sensible appearance of that substance, but the\r\nfourth gave indications which were not merely evident, but abundant for the\r\ncircumstances under which it had been introduced. The result sufficiently\r\nshows with what difficulty that portion of the substance which is in\r\n_contact_ with the metal leaves it; and as the contact of the fluid formed\r\nagainst the plate in the voltaic circuit must be as intimate and as perfect\r\nas possible, it is easy to see how quickly and greatly it must vary from\r\nthe general fluid in the cells, and how influential in diminishing the\r\nforce of the battery this effect must be.\r\n\r\n1039. In the ordinary voltaic pile, the influence of this effect will occur\r\nin all variety of degrees. The extremities of a trough of twenty pairs of\r\nplates of Wollaston's construction were connected with the\r\nvolta-electrometer, fig. 66. (711.), of the Seventh Series of these\r\nResearches, and after five minutes the number of bubbles of gas issuing\r\nfrom the extremity of the tube, in consequence of the decomposition of the\r\nwater, noted. Without moving the plates, the acid between the copper and\r\nzinc was agitated by the introduction of a feather. The bubbles were\r\nimmediately evolved more rapidly, above twice the number being produced in\r\nthe same portion of time as before. In this instance it is very evident\r\nthat agitation by a feather must have been a very imperfect mode of\r\nrestoring the acid in the cells against the plates towards its first equal\r\ncondition; and yet imperfect as the means were, they more than doubled the\r\npower of the battery. The _first effect_ of a battery which is known to be\r\nso superior to the degree of action which the battery can sustain, is\r\nalmost entirely due to the favourable condition of the acid in contact with\r\nthe plates.\r\n\r\n1040. A _second_ cause of diminution in the force of the voltaic battery,\r\nconsequent upon its own action, is that extraordinary state of the surfaces\r\nof the metals (969.) which was first described, I believe, by Ritter[A], to\r\nwhich he refers the powers of his secondary piles, and which has been so\r\nwell experimented upon by Marianini, and also by A. De la Rive. If the\r\napparatus, fig. 103. (1096.), be left in action for an hour or two, with\r\nthe wire 3 in contact with the plate _p_, so as to allow a free passage for\r\nthe current, then, though the contact be broken for ten or twelve minutes,\r\nstill, upon its renewal, only a feeble current will pass, not at all equal\r\nin force to what might be expected. Further, if P^{1} and P^{2} be\r\nconnected by a metal wire, a powerful momentary current will pass from\r\nP^{2} to P^{1} through the acid, and therefore in the reverse direction to\r\nthat produced by the action of the zinc in the arrangement; and after this\r\nhas happened, the general current can pass through the whole of the system\r\nas at first, but by its passage again restores the plates P^{2} and P^{1}\r\ninto the former opposing condition. This, generally, is the fact described\r\nby Ritter, Marianini, and De la Rive. It has great opposing influence on\r\nthe action of a pile, especially if the latter consist of but a small\r\nnumber of alternations, and has to pass its current through many\r\ninterpositions. It varies with the solution in which the interposed plates\r\nare immersed, with the intensity of the current, the strength of the pile,\r\nthe time of action, and especially with accidental discharges of the plates\r\nby inadvertent contacts or reversions of the plates during experiments, and\r\nmust be carefully watched in every endeavour to trace the source, strength,\r\nand variations of the voltaic current. Its effect was avoided in the\r\nexperiments already described (1036. &c.), by making contact between the\r\nplates P^{1} and P^{2} before the effect dependent upon the state of the\r\nsolution in contact with the zinc plate was observed, and by other\r\nprecautions.\r\n\r\n  [A] Journal de Physique, lvii. p. 349.\r\n\r\n1041. When an apparatus like fig. 98. (1017.) with several platina plates\r\nwas used, being connected with a battery able to force a current through\r\nthem, the power which they acquired, of producing a reversed current, was\r\nvery considerable.\r\n\r\n1042. _Weak and exhausted charges_ should never be used at the same time\r\nwith _strong and fresh ones_ in the different cells of a trough, or the\r\ndifferent troughs of a battery: the fluid in all the cells should be alike,\r\nelse the plates in the weaker cells, in place of assisting, retard the\r\npassage of the electricity generated in, and transmitted across, the\r\nstronger cells. Each zinc plate so circumstanced has to be assisted in\r\ndecomposing power before the whole current can pass between it and the\r\nliquid. So, that, if in a battery of fifty pairs of plates, ten of the\r\ncells contain a weaker charge than the others, it is as if ten decomposing\r\nplates were opposed to the transit of the current of forty pairs of\r\ngenerating plates (1031.). Hence a serious loss of force, and hence the\r\nreason why, if the ten pairs of plates were removed, the remaining forty\r\npairs would be much more powerful than the whole fifty.\r\n\r\n1043. Five similar troughs, of ten pairs of plates each, were prepared,\r\nfour of them with a good uniform charge of acid, and the fifth with the\r\npartially neutralized acid of a used battery. Being arranged in right\r\norder, and connected with a volta-electrometer (711.), the whole fifty\r\npairs of plates yielded 1.1 cubic inch of oxygen and hydrogen in one\r\nminute: but on moving one of the connecting wires so that only the four\r\nwell-charged troughs should be included in the circuit, they produced with\r\nthe same volta-electrometer 8.4 cubical inches of gas in the same time.\r\nNearly seven-eighths of the power of the four troughs had been lost,\r\ntherefore, by their association with the fifth trough.\r\n\r\n1044. The same battery of fifty pairs of plates, after being thus used, was\r\nconnected with a volta-electrometer (711.), so that by quickly shifting the\r\nwires of communication, the current of the whole of the battery, or of any\r\nportion of it, could be made to pass through the instrument for given\r\nportions of time in succession. The whole of the battery evolved 0.9 of a\r\ncubic inch of oxygen and hydrogen in half a minute; the forty plates\r\nevolved 4.6 cubic inches in the same time; the whole then evolved 1 cubic\r\ninch in the half-minute; the ten weakly charged evolved 0.4 of a cubic inch\r\nin the time given: and finally the whole evolved 1.15 cubic inch in the\r\nstandard time. The order of the observations was that given: the results\r\nsufficiently show the extremely injurious effect produced by the mixture of\r\nstrong and weak charges in the same battery[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] The gradual increase in the action of the whole fifty pairs of\r\n  plates was due to the elevation of temperature in the weakly charged\r\n  trough by the passage of the current, in consequence of which the\r\n  exciting energies of the fluid within were increased.\r\n\r\n1045. In the same manner associations of _strong and weak_ pairs of plates\r\nshould be carefully avoided. A pair of copper and platina plates arranged\r\nin _accordance_ with a pair of zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, were found to stop the action of the latter, or even of two pairs of\r\nthe latter, as effectually almost as an interposed plate of platina\r\n(1011.), or as if the copper itself had been platina. It, in fact, became\r\nan interposed decomposing plate, and therefore a retarding instead of an\r\nassisting pair.\r\n\r\n1046. The _reversal_, by accident or otherwise, of the plates in a battery\r\nhas an exceedingly injurious effect. It is not merely the counteraction of\r\nthe current which the reversed plates can produce, but their effect also in\r\nretarding even as indifferent plates, and requiring decomposition to be\r\neffected upon their surface, in _accordance_ with the course of the\r\ncurrent, before the latter can pass. They oppose the current, therefore, in\r\nthe first place, as interposed platina plates would do (1011-1018.); and to\r\nthis they add a force of opposition as counter-voltaic plates. I find that,\r\nin a series of four pairs of zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, if one pair be reversed, it very nearly neutralizes the power of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n1047. There are many other causes of reaction, retardation, and\r\nirregularity in the voltaic battery. Amongst them is the not unusual one of\r\nprecipitation of copper upon the zinc in the cells, the injurious effect of\r\nwhich has before been adverted to (1006.). But their interest is not\r\nperhaps sufficient to justify any increase of the length of this paper,\r\nwhich is rather intended to be an investigation of the theory of the\r\nvoltaic pile than a particular account of its practical application[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] For further practical results relating to these points of the\r\n  philosophy of the voltaic battery, see Series X. § 17.\r\n  1163.--1160.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Many of the views and experiments in this Series of my\r\nExperimental Researches will be seen at once to be corrections and\r\nextensions of the theory of electro-chemical decomposition, given in the\r\nFifth and Seventh Series of these Researches. The expressions I would now\r\nalter are those which concern the independence of the evolved elements in\r\nrelation to the poles or electrodes, and the reference of their evolution\r\nto powers entirely internal (524. 537. 661.). The present paper fully shows\r\nmy present views; and I would refer to paragraphs 891. 904. 910. 917. 918.\r\n947. 963. 1007. 1031. &c., as stating what they are. I hope this note will\r\nbe considered as sufficient in the way of correction at present; for I\r\nwould rather defer revising the whole theory of electro-chemical\r\ndecomposition until I can obtain clearer views of the way in which the\r\npower under consideration can appear at one time as associated with\r\nparticles giving them their chemical attraction, and at another as free\r\nelectricity (493. 957.).--M.F.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nMarch 31st, 1834._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNINTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15. _On the influence by induction of an Electric Current on itself:--and\r\non the inductive action of Electric Currents generally._\r\n\r\nReceived December 18, 1834,--Read January 29, 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n1048. The following investigations relate to a very remarkable inductive\r\naction of electric currents, or of the different parts of the same current\r\n(74.), and indicate an immediate connexion between such inductive action\r\nand the direct transmission of electricity through conducting bodies, or\r\neven that exhibited in the form of a spark.\r\n\r\n1049. The inquiry arose out of a fact communicated to me by Mr. Jenkin,\r\nwhich is as follows. If an ordinary wire of short length be used as the\r\nmedium of communication between the two plates of an electromotor\r\nconsisting of a single pair of metals, no management will enable the\r\nexperimenter to obtain an electric shock from this wire; but if the wire\r\nwhich surrounds an electro-magnet be used, a shock is felt each time the\r\ncontact with the electromotor is broken, provided the ends of the wire be\r\ngrasped one in each hand.\r\n\r\n1050. Another effect is observed at the same time, which has long been\r\nknown to philosophers, namely, that a bright electric spark occurs at the\r\nplace of disjunction.\r\n\r\n1051. A brief account of these results, with some of a corresponding\r\ncharacter which I had observed in using long wires, was published in the\r\nPhilosophical Magazine for 1834[A]; and I added to them some observations\r\non their nature. Further investigations led me to perceive the inaccuracy\r\nof my first notions, and ended in identifying these effects with the\r\nphenomena of induction which I had been fortunate enough to develop in the\r\nFirst Series of these Experimental Researches (1.-59.)[B]. Notwithstanding\r\nthis identity, the extension and the results supply, lead me to believe\r\nthat they will be found worthy of the attention of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n  [A] Vol. v. pp. 349, 444.\r\n\r\n  [B] Philosophical Transactions, 1832, p. 126.\r\n\r\n1052. The _electromotor_ used consisted of a cylinder of zinc introduced\r\nbetween the two parts of a double cylinder of copper, and preserved from\r\nmetallic contact in the usual way by corks. The zinc cylinder was eight\r\ninches high and four inches in diameter. Both it and the copper cylinder\r\nwere supplied with stiff wires, surmounted by cups containing mercury; and\r\nit was at these cups that the contacts of wires, helices, or\r\nelectro-magnets, used to complete the circuit, were made or broken. These\r\ncups I will call G and E throughout the rest of this paper (1079.).\r\n\r\n1053. Certain _helices_ were constructed, some of which it will be\r\nnecessary to describe. A pasteboard tube had four copper wires, one\r\ntwenty-fourth of an inch in thickness, wound round it, each forming a helix\r\nin the same direction from end to end: the convolutions of each wire were\r\nseparated by string, and the superposed helices prevented from touching by\r\nintervening calico. The lengths of the wires forming the helices were 48,\r\n49.5, 48, and 45 feet. The first and third wires were united together so as\r\nto form one consistent helix of 96 feet in length; and the second and\r\nfourth wires were similarly united to form a second helix, closely\r\ninterwoven with the first, and 94.5 feet in length. These helices may be\r\ndistinguished by the numbers i and ii. They were carefully examined by a\r\npowerful current of electricity and a galvanometer, and found to have no\r\ncommunication with each other.\r\n\r\n1054. Another helix was constructed upon a similar pasteboard tube, two\r\nlengths of the same copper wire being used, each forty-six feet long. These\r\nwere united into one consistent helix of ninety-two feet, which therefore\r\nwas nearly equal in value to either of the former helices, but was not in\r\nclose inductive association with them. It may be distinguished by the\r\nnumber iii.\r\n\r\n1055. A fourth helix was constructed of very thick copper wire, being\r\none-fifth of an inch in diameter; the length of wire used was seventy-nine\r\nfeet, independent of the straight terminal portions.\r\n\r\n1056. The principal _electro-magnet_ employed consisted of a cylindrical\r\nbar of soft iron twenty-five inches long, and one inch and three quarters\r\nin diameter, bent into a ring, so that the ends nearly touched, and\r\nsurrounded by three coils of thick copper wire, the similar ends of which\r\nwere fastened together; each of these terminations was soldered to a copper\r\nrod, serving as a conducting continuation of the wire. Hence any electric\r\ncurrent sent through the rods was divided in the helices surrounding the\r\nring, into three parts, all of which, however, moved in the same direction.\r\nThe three wires may therefore be considered as representing one wire, of\r\nthrice the thickness of the wire really used.\r\n\r\n1057. Other electro-magnets could be made at pleasure by introducing a soft\r\niron rod into any of the helices described (1053, &c.).\r\n\r\n1058. The _galvanometer_ which I had occasion to use was rough in its\r\nconstruction, having but one magnetic needle, and not at all delicate in\r\nits indications.\r\n\r\n1059. The effects to be considered _depend on the conductor_ employed to\r\ncomplete the communication between the zinc and copper plates of the\r\nelectromotor; and I shall have to consider this conductor under four\r\ndifferent forms: as the helix of an electro-magnet (1056); as an ordinary\r\nhelix (1053, &c.); as a _long_ extended wire, having its course such that\r\nthe parts can exert little or no mutual influence; and as a _short_ wire.\r\nIn all cases the conductor was of copper.\r\n\r\n1060. The peculiar effects are best shown by the _electro-magnet_ (1056.).\r\nWhen it was used to complete the communication at the electromotor, there\r\nwas no sensible spark on _making_ contact, but on _breaking_ contact there\r\nwas a very large and bright spark, with considerable combustion of the\r\nmercury. Then, again, with respect to the shock: if the hands were\r\nmoistened in salt and water, and good contact between them and the wires\r\nretained, no shock could be felt upon _making_ contact at the electromotor,\r\nbut a powerful one on _breaking_ contact.\r\n\r\n1061. When the _helix_ i or iii (1053, &c.) was used as the connecting\r\nconductor, there was also a good spark on breaking contact, but none\r\n(sensibly) on making contact. On trying to obtain the shock from these\r\nhelices, I could not succeed at first. By joining the similar ends of i and\r\nii so as to make the two helices equivalent to one helix, having wire of\r\ndouble thickness, I could just obtain the sensation. Using the helix of\r\nthick wire (1055.) the shock was distinctly obtained. On placing the tongue\r\nbetween two plates of silver connected by wires with the parts which the\r\nhands had heretofore touched (1064.), there was a powerful shock on\r\n_breaking_ contact, but none on _making_ contact.\r\n\r\n1062. The power of producing these phenomena exists therefore in the simple\r\nhelix, as in the electro-magnet, although by no means in the same high\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n1063. On putting a bar of soft iron into the helix, it became an\r\nelectro-magnet (1057.), and its power was instantly and greatly raised. On\r\nputting a bar of copper into the helix, no change was produced, the action\r\nbeing that of the helix alone. The two helices i and ii, made into one\r\nhelix of twofold length of wire, produced a greater effect than either i or\r\nii alone.\r\n\r\n1064. On descending from the helix to the mere _long wire_, the following\r\neffects were obtained, A copper wire, 0.18 of an inch in diameter, and 132\r\nfeet in length, was laid out upon the floor of the laboratory, and used as\r\nthe connecting conductor (1059.); it gave no sensible spark on making\r\ncontact, but produced a bright one on breaking contact, yet not so bright\r\nas that from the helix (1061.) On endeavouring to obtain the electric shock\r\nat the moment contact was broken, I could not succeed so as to make it pass\r\nthrough the hands; but by using two silver plates fastened by small wires\r\nto the extremity of the principal wire used, and introducing the tongue\r\nbetween those plates, I succeeded in obtaining powerful shocks upon the\r\ntongue and gums, and could easily convulse a flounder, an eel, or a frog.\r\nNone of these effects could be obtained directly from the electromotor,\r\ni.e. when the tongue, frog, or fish was in a similar, and therefore\r\ncomparative manner, interposed in the course of the communication between\r\nthe zinc and copper plates, separated everywhere else by the acid used to\r\nexcite the combination, or by air. The bright spark and the shock, produced\r\nonly on breaking contact, are therefore effects of the same kind as those\r\nproduced in a higher degree by the helix, and in a still higher degree by\r\nthe electro-magnet.\r\n\r\n1065. In order to compare an extended wire with a helix, the helix i,\r\ncontaining ninety-six feet, and ninety-six feet of the same-sized wire\r\nlying on the floor of the laboratory, were used alternately as conductors:\r\nthe former gave a much brighter spark at the moment of disjunction than the\r\nlatter. Again, twenty-eight feet of copper wire were made up into a helix,\r\nand being used gave a good spark on disjunction at the electromotor; being\r\nthen suddenly pulled out and again employed, it gave a much smaller spark\r\nthan before, although nothing but its spiral arrangement had been changed.\r\n\r\n1066. As the superiority of a helix over a wire is important to the\r\nphilosophy of the effect, I took particular pains to ascertain the fact\r\nwith certainty. A wire of copper sixty-seven feet long was bent in the\r\nmiddle so as to form a double termination which could be communicated with\r\nthe electromotor; one of the halves of this wire was made into a helix and\r\nthe other remained in its extended condition. When these were used\r\nalternately as the connecting wire, the helix half gave by much the\r\nstrongest spark. It even gave a stronger spark than when it and the\r\nextended wire were used conjointly as a double conductor.\r\n\r\n1067. When a _short wire_ is used, _all_ these effects disappear. If it be\r\nonly two or three inches long, a spark can scarcely be perceived on\r\nbreaking the junction. If it be ten or twelve inches long and moderately\r\nthick, a small spark may be more easily obtained. As the length is\r\nincreased, the spark becomes proportionately brighter, until from extreme\r\nlength the resistance offered by the metal as a conductor begins to\r\ninterfere with the principal result.\r\n\r\n1068. The effect of elongation was well shown thus: 114 feet of copper\r\nwire, one-eighteenth of an inch in diameter, were extended on the floor and\r\nused as a conductor; it remained cold, but gave a bright spark on breaking\r\ncontact. Being crossed so that the two terminations were in contact near\r\nthe extremities, it was again used as a conductor, only twelve inches now\r\nbeing included in the circuit: the wire became very hot from the greater\r\nquantity of electricity passing through it, and yet the spark on breaking\r\ncontact was scarcely visible. The experiment was repeated with a wire\r\none-ninth of an inch in diameter and thirty-six feet long with the same\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n1069. That the effects, and also the action, in all these forms of the\r\nexperiment are identical, is evident from the manner in which the former\r\ncan be gradually raised from that produced by the shortest wire to that of\r\nthe most powerful electro-magnet: and this capability of examining what\r\nwill happen by the most powerful apparatus, and then experimenting for the\r\nsame results, or reasoning from them, with the weaker arrangements, is of\r\ngreat advantage in making out the true principles of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n1070. The action is evidently dependent upon the wire which serves as a\r\nconductor; for it varies as that wire varies in its length or arrangement.\r\nThe shortest wire may be considered as exhibiting the full effect of spark\r\nor shock which the electromotor can produce by its own direct power; all\r\nthe additional force which the arrangements described can excite being due\r\nto some affection of the current, either permanent or momentary, in the\r\nwire itself. That it is a _momentary_ effect, produced only at the instant\r\nof breaking contact, will be fully proved (1089. 1100.).\r\n\r\n1071. No change takes place in the quantity or intensity of the current\r\nduring the time the latter is _continued_, from the moment after contact is\r\nmade, up to that previous to disunion, except what depends upon the\r\nincreased obstruction offered to the passage of the electricity by a long\r\nwire as compared to a short wire. To ascertain this point with regard to\r\n_quantity_, the helix i (1053.) and the galvanometer (1055.) were both made\r\nparts of the metallic circuit used to connect the plates of a small\r\nelectromotor, and the deflection at the galvanometer was observed; then a\r\nsoft iron core was put into the helix, and as soon as the momentary effect\r\nwas over, and the needle had become stationary, it was again observed, and\r\nfound to stand exactly at the same division as before. Thus the quantity\r\npassing through the wire when the current was continued was the same either\r\nwith or without the soft iron, although the peculiar effects occurring at\r\nthe moment of disjunction were very different in degree under such\r\nvariation of circumstances.\r\n\r\n1072. That the quality of _intensity_ belonging to the constant current did\r\nnot vary with the circumstances favouring the peculiar results under\r\nconsideration, so as to yield an explanation of those results, was\r\nascertained in the following manner. The current excited by an electromotor\r\nwas passed through short wires, and its intensity tried by subjecting\r\ndifferent substances to its electrolyzing power (912. 966. &c.); it was\r\nthen passed through the wires of the powerful electro-magnet (1056.), and\r\nagain examined with respect to its intensity by the same means and found\r\nunchanged. Again, the constancy of the _quantity_ passed in the above\r\nexperiment (1071.) adds further proof that the intensity could not have\r\nvaried; for had it been increased upon the introduction of the soft iron,\r\nthere is every reason to believe that the quantity passed in a given time\r\nwould also have increased.\r\n\r\n1073. The fact is, that under many variations of the experiments, the\r\npermanent current _loses_ in force as the effects upon breaking contact\r\nbecome _exalted_. This is abundantly evident in the comparative experiments\r\nwith long and short wires (1068.); and is still more strikingly shown by\r\nthe following variation. Solder an inch or two in length of fine platina\r\nwire (about one-hundredth of an inch in diameter) on to one end of the long\r\ncommunicating wire, and also a similar length of the same platina wire on\r\nto one end of the short communication; then, in comparing the effects of\r\nthese two communications, make and break contact between the platina\r\nterminations and the mercury of the cup G or E (1079.). When the short wire\r\nis used, the platina will be _ignited by the constant current_, because of\r\nthe quantity of electricity, but the spark on breaking contact will be\r\nhardly visible; on using the longer communicating wire, which by\r\nobstructing will diminish the current, the platina will remain cold whilst\r\nthe current passes, but give a bright spark at the moment it ceases: thus\r\nthe strange result is obtained of a diminished spark and shock from the\r\nstrong current, and increased effects from the weak one. Hence the spark\r\nand shock at the moment of disjunction, although resulting from great\r\nintensity and quantity, of the current _at that moment_, are no direct\r\nindicators or measurers of the intensity or quantity of the constant\r\ncurrent previously passing, and by which they are ultimately produced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1074. It is highly important in using the spark as an indication, by its\r\nrelative brightness, of these effects, to bear in mind certain\r\ncircumstances connected with its production and appearance (958.). An\r\nordinary electric spark is understood to be the bright appearance of\r\nelectricity passing suddenly through an interval of air, or other badly\r\nconducting matter. A voltaic spark is sometimes of the same nature, but,\r\ngenerally, is due to the ignition and even combustion of a minute portion\r\nof a good conductor; and that is especially the case when the electromotor\r\nconsists of but one or few pairs of plates. This can be very well observed\r\nif either or both of the metallic surfaces intended to touch be solid and\r\npointed. The moment they come in contact the current passes; it heats,\r\nignites, and even burns the touching points, and the appearance is as if\r\nthe spark passed on making contact, whereas it is only a case of ignition\r\nby the current, contact being previously made, and is perfectly analogous\r\nto the ignition of a fine platina wire connecting the extremities of a\r\nvoltaic battery.\r\n\r\n1075. When mercury constitutes one or both of the surfaces used, the\r\nbrightness of the spark is greatly increased. But as this effect is due to\r\nthe action on, and probable combustion of, the metal, such sparks must only\r\nbe compared with other sparks also taken from mercurial surfaces, and not\r\nwith such as may be taken, for instance, between surfaces of platina or\r\ngold, for then the appearances are far less bright, though the same\r\nquantity of electricity be passed. It is not at all unlikely that the\r\ncommonly occurring circumstance of combustion may affect even the duration\r\nof the light; and that sparks taken between mercury, copper, or other\r\ncombustible bodies, will continue for a period sensibly longer than those\r\npassing between platina or gold.\r\n\r\n1076. When the end of a short clean copper wire, attached to one plate of\r\nan electromotor, is brought down carefully upon a surface of mercury\r\nconnected with the other plate, a spark, almost continuous, can be\r\nobtained. This I refer to a succession of effects of the following nature:\r\nfirst, contact,--then ignition of the touching points,--recession of the\r\nmercury from the mechanical results of the heat produced at the place of\r\ncontact, and the electro-magnetic condition of the parts at the moment[A],\r\n--breaking of the contact and the production of the peculiar intense effect\r\ndependent thereon,--renewal of the contact by the returning surface of the\r\nundulating mercury,--and then a repetition of the same series of effects,\r\nand that with such rapidity as to present the appearance of a continued\r\ndischarge. If a long wire or an electro-magnet be used as the connecting\r\nconductor instead of a short wire, a similar appearance may be produced by\r\ntapping the vessel containing the mercury and making it vibrate; but the\r\nsparks do not usually follow each other so rapidly as to produce an\r\napparently continuous spark, because of the time required, when the long\r\nwire or electro-magnet is used, both for the full development of the\r\ncurrent (1101. 1106.) and for its complete cessation.\r\n\r\n  [A] Quarterly Journal of Science, vol. xii, p. 420.\r\n\r\n1077. Returning to the phenomena in question, the first thought that arises\r\nin the mind is, that the electricity circulates with something like\r\n_momentum or inertia_ in the wire, and that thus a long wire produces\r\neffects at the instant the current is stopped, which a short wire cannot\r\nproduce. Such an explanation is, however, at once set aside by the fact,\r\nthat the same length of wire produces the effects in very different\r\ndegrees, according as it is simply extended, or made into a helix, or forms\r\nthe circuit of an electro-magnet (1069.). The experiments to be adduced\r\n(1089.) will still more strikingly show that the idea of momentum cannot\r\napply.\r\n\r\n1078. The bright spark at the electromotor, and the shock in the arms,\r\nappeared evidently to be due to _one_ current in the long wire, divided\r\ninto two parts by the double channel afforded through the body and through\r\nthe electromotor; for that the spark was evolved at the place of\r\ndisjunction with the electromotor, not by any direct action of the latter,\r\nbut by a force immediately exerted in the wire of communication, seemed to\r\nbe without doubt (1070.). It followed, therefore, that by using a better\r\nconductor in place of the human body, the _whole_ of this extra current\r\nmight be made to pass at that place; and thus be separated from that which\r\nthe electromotor could produce by its immediate action, and its _direction_\r\nbe examined apart from any interference of the original and originating\r\ncurrent. This was found to be true; for on connecting the ends of the\r\nprincipal wire together by a cross wire two or three feet in length,\r\napplied just where the hands had felt the shock, the whole of the extra\r\ncurrent passed by the new channel, and then no better spark than one\r\nproducible by a short wire was obtained on disjunction at the electromotor.\r\n\r\n1079. The _current_ thus separated was examined by galvanometers and\r\ndecomposing apparatus introduced into the course of this wire. I will\r\nalways speak of it as the current in the cross wire or wires, so that no\r\nmistake, as to its place or origin, may occur. In the wood-cut, Z and C\r\nrepresent the zinc and copper plates of the electromotor; G and E the cups\r\nof mercury where contact is made or broken (1052.); A and B the\r\nterminations of D, the long wire, the helix or the electro-magnet, used to\r\ncomplete the circuit; N and P are the cross wires, which can either be\r\nbrought into contact at _x_, or else have a galvanometer (1058.) or an\r\nelectrolyzing apparatus (312. 316.) interposed there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe production of the _shock_ from the current in the cross wire, whether D\r\nwas a long extended wire, or a helix, or an electro-magnet, has been\r\nalready described (1060. 1061. 1064.).\r\n\r\n1080. The _spark_ of the cross-wire current could be produced at _x_ in the\r\nfollowing manner: D was made an electro-magnet; the metallic extremities at\r\n_x_ were held close together, or rubbed lightly against each other, whilst\r\ncontact was broken at G or E. When the communication was perfect at _x_,\r\nlittle or no spark appeared at G or E. When the condition of vicinity at\r\n_x_ was favourable for the result required, a bright spark would pass there\r\nat the moment of disjunction, _none_ occurring at G and E: this spark was\r\nthe luminous passage of the extra current through the cross-wires. When\r\nthere was no contact or passage of current at _x_, then the spark appeared\r\nat G or E, the extra current forcing its way through the electromotor\r\nitself. The same results were obtained by the use of the helix or the\r\nextended wire at D in place of the electro-magnet.\r\n\r\n1081. On introducing a fine platina wire at _x_, and employing the\r\nelectro-magnet at D, no visible effects occurred as long as contact was\r\ncontinued; but on breaking contact at G or E, the fine wire was instantly\r\nignited and fused. A longer or thicker wire could be so adjusted at _x_ as\r\nto show ignition, without fusion, every time the contact was broken at G\r\nor E.\r\n\r\n1082. It is rather difficult to obtain this effect with helices or wires,\r\nand for very simple reasons: with the helices i, ii, or iii, there was such\r\nretardation of the electric current, from the length of wire used, that a\r\nfull inch of platina wire one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter could be\r\nretained ignited at the cross-wires during the _continuance of contact_, by\r\nthe portion of electricity passing through it. Hence it was impossible to\r\ndistinguish the particular effects at the moments of making or breaking\r\ncontact from this constant effect. On using the thick wire helix (1055.),\r\nthe same results ensued.\r\n\r\n1083. Proceeding upon the known fact that electric currents of great\r\nquantity but low intensity, though able to ignite thick wires, cannot\r\nproduce that effect upon thin ones, I used a very fine platina wire at _x_,\r\nreducing its diameter until a spark appeared at G or E, when contact was\r\nbroken there. A quarter of an inch of such wire might be introduced at _x_\r\nwithout being ignited by the _continuance_ of contact at G or E; but when\r\ncontact was broken at either place, this wire became red-hot; proving, by\r\nthis method, the production of the induced current at that moment.\r\n\r\n1084. _Chemical decomposition_ was next effected by the cross-wire current,\r\nan electro-magnet being used at D, and a decomposing apparatus, with\r\nsolution of iodide of potassium in paper (1079.), employed at _x_. The\r\nconducting power of the connecting system A B D was sufficient to carry all\r\nthe primary current, and consequently no chemical action took place at _x_\r\nduring the _continuance_ of contact at G and E; but when contact was\r\nbroken, there was instantly decomposition at _x_. The iodine appeared\r\nagainst the wire N, and not against the wire P; thus demonstrating that the\r\ncurrent through the cross-wires, when contact was broken, was in the\r\n_reverse direction_ to that marked by the arrow, or that which the\r\nelectromotor would have sent through it.\r\n\r\n1085. In this experiment a bright spark occurs at the place of disjunction,\r\nindicating that only a small part of the extra current passed the apparatus\r\nat _x_, because of the small conducting power of the latter.\r\n\r\n1086. I found it difficult to obtain the chemical effects with the simple\r\nhelices and wires, in consequence of the diminished inductive power of\r\nthese arrangements, and because of the passage of a strong constant current\r\nat _x_ whenever a very active electromotor was used (1082).\r\n\r\n1087. The most instructive set of results was obtained, however, when the\r\n_galvanometer_ was introduced at _x_. Using an electro-magnet at D, and\r\ncontinuing contact, a current was then indicated by the deflection,\r\nproceeding from P to N, in the direction of the arrow; the cross-wire\r\nserving to carry one part of the electricity excited by the electromotor,\r\nand that part of the arrangement marked A B D, the other and far greater\r\npart, as indicated by the arrows. The magnetic needle was then forced back,\r\nby pins applied upon opposite sides of its two extremities, to its natural\r\nposition when uninfluenced by a current; after which, contact being\r\n_broken_ at G or E, it was deflected strongly in the opposite direction;\r\nthus showing, in accordance with the chemical effects (1084), that the\r\nextra current followed a course in the cross-wires _contrary_ to that\r\nindicated by the arrow, i. e. contrary to the one produced by the direct\r\naction of the electromotor[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] It was ascertained experimentally, that if a strong current was\r\n  passed through the galvanometer only, and the needle restrained in one\r\n  direction as above in its natural position, when the current was\r\n  stopped, no vibration of the needle in the opposite direction took\r\n  place.\r\n\r\n1088. With the _helix_ only (1061.), these effects could scarcely be\r\nobserved, in consequence of the smaller inductive force of this\r\narrangement, the opposed action from induction in the galvanometer wire\r\nitself, the mechanical condition and tension of the needle from the effect\r\nof blocking (1087.) whilst the current due to continuance of contact was\r\npassing round it; and because of other causes. With the _extended wire_\r\n(1064.) all these circumstances had still greater influence, and therefore\r\nallowed less chance of success.\r\n\r\n1089. These experiments, establishing as they did, by the quantity,\r\nintensity, and even direction, a distinction between the primary or\r\ngenerating current and the extra current, led me to conclude that the\r\nlatter was identical with the induced current described (6. 26. 74.) in the\r\nFirst Series of these Researches; and this opinion I was soon able to bring\r\nto proof, and at the same times obtained not the partial (1078.) but entire\r\nseparation of one current from the other.\r\n\r\n1090. The double helix (1053.) was arranged so that it should form the\r\nconnecting wire between the plates of the electromotor, in being out of the\r\ncurrent, and its ends unconnected. In this condition it acted very well,\r\nand gave a good spark at the time and place of disjunction. The opposite\r\nends of ii were then connected together so as to form an endless wire, i\r\nremaining unchanged: but now _no spark_, or one scarcely sensible, could be\r\nobtained from the latter at the place of disjunction. Then, again, the ends\r\nof ii were held so nearly together that any current running round that\r\nhelix should be rendered visible as a spark; and in this manner a spark was\r\nobtained from ii when the junction of i with the electromotor was broken,\r\nin place of appearing at the disjoined extremity of i itself.\r\n\r\n1091. By introducing a galvanometer or decomposing apparatus into the\r\ncircuit formed by the helix ii, I could easily obtain the deflections and\r\ndecomposition occasioned by the induced current due to the breaking contact\r\nat helix i, or even to that occasioned by making contact of that helix with\r\nthe electromotor; the results in both cases indicating the contrary\r\ndirections of the two induced currents thus produced (26.).\r\n\r\n1092. All these effects, except those of decomposition, were reproduced by\r\ntwo extended long wires, not having the form of helices, but placed close\r\nto each other; and thus it was proved that the _extra current_ could be\r\nremoved from the wire carrying the original current to a neighbouring wire,\r\nand was at the same time identified, in direction and every other respect,\r\nwith the currents producible by induction (1089.). The case, therefore, of\r\nthe bright spark and shock on disjunction may now be stated thus: If a\r\ncurrent be established in a wire, and another wire, forming a complete\r\ncircuit, be placed parallel to the first, at the moment the current in the\r\nfirst is stopped it induces a current in the _same_ direction in the\r\nsecond, the first exhibiting then but a feeble spark; but if the second\r\nwire be away, disjunction of the first wire induces a current in itself in\r\nthe same direction, producing a strong spark. The strong spark in the\r\nsingle long wire or helix, at the moment of disjunction, is therefore the\r\nequivalent of the current which would be produced in a neighbouring wire if\r\nsuch second current were permitted.\r\n\r\n1093. Viewing the phenomena as the results of the induction of electrical\r\ncurrents, many of the principles of action, in the former experiments,\r\nbecome far more evident and precise. Thus the different effects of short\r\nwires, long wires, helices, and electro-magnets (1069.) may be\r\ncomprehended. If the inductive action of a wire a foot long upon a\r\ncollateral wire also a foot in length, be observed, it will be found very\r\nsmall; but if the same current be sent through a wire fifty feet long, it\r\nwill induce in a neighbouring wire of fifty feet a far more powerful\r\ncurrent at the moment of making or breaking contact, each successive foot\r\nof wire adding to the sum of action; and by parity of reasoning, a similar\r\neffect should take place when the conducting wire is also that in which the\r\ninduced current is formed (74.): hence the reason why a long wire gives a\r\nbrighter spark on breaking contact than a short one (1068.), although it\r\ncarries much less electricity.\r\n\r\n1094. If the long wire be made into a helix, it will then be still more\r\neffective in producing sparks and shocks on breaking contact; for by the\r\nmutual inductive action of the convolutions each aids its neighbour, and\r\nwill be aided in turn, and the sum of effect will be very greatly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n1095. If an electro-magnet be employed, the effect will be still more\r\nhighly exalted; because the iron, magnetized by the power of the continuing\r\ncurrent, will lose its magnetism at the moment the current ceases to pass,\r\nand in so doing will tend to produce an electric current in the wire around\r\nit (37. 38.), in conformity with that which the cessation of current in the\r\nhelix itself also tends to produce.\r\n\r\n1096. By applying the laws of the induction of electric currents formerly\r\ndeveloped (6. &c.), various new conditions of the experiments could be\r\ndevised, which by their results should serve as tests of the accuracy of\r\nthe view just given. Thus, if a long wire be doubled, so that the current\r\nin the two halves shall have opposite actions, it ought not to give a\r\nsensible spark at the moment of disjunction: and this proved to be the\r\ncase, for a wire forty feet long, covered with silk, being doubled and tied\r\nclosely together to within four inches of the extremities, when used in\r\nthat state, gave scarcely a perceptible spark; but being opened out and the\r\nparts separated, it gave a very good one. The two helices i and ii being\r\njoined at their similar ends, and then used at their other extremities to\r\nconnect the plates of the electromotor, thus constituted one long helix, of\r\nwhich one half was opposed in direction to the other half: under these\r\ncircumstances it gave scarcely a sensible spark, even when the soft iron\r\ncore was within, although containing nearly two hundred feet of wire. When\r\nit was made into one consistent helix of the same length of wire it gave a\r\nvery bright spark.\r\n\r\n1097. Similar proofs can be drawn from the mutual inductive action of two\r\nseparate currents (1110.); and it is important for the general principles\r\nthat the consistent action of two such currents should be established.\r\nThus, two currents going in the same direction should, if simultaneously\r\nstopped, aid each other by their relative influence; or if proceeding in\r\ncontrary directions, should oppose each other under similar circumstances.\r\nI endeavoured at first to obtain two currents from two different\r\nelectromotors, and passing them through the helices i and ii, tried to\r\neffect the disjunctions mechanically at the same moment. But in this I\r\ncould not succeed; one was always separated before the other, and in that\r\ncase produced little or no spark, its inductive power being employed in\r\nthrowing a current round the remaining complete circuit (1090.): the\r\ncurrent which was stopped last always gave a bright spark. If it were ever\r\nto become needful to ascertain whether two junctions were accurately broken\r\nat the same moment, these sparks would afford a test for the purpose,\r\nhaving an infinitesimal degree of perfection.\r\n\r\n1098. I was able to prove the points by other expedients. Two short thick\r\nwires were selected to serve as terminations, by which contact could be\r\nmade or broken with the electromotor. The compound helix, consisting of i\r\nand ii (1053.), was adjusted so that the extremities of the two helices\r\ncould be placed in communication with the two terminal wires, in such a\r\nmanner that the current moving through the thick wires should be divided\r\ninto two equal portions in the two helices, these portions travelling,\r\naccording to the mode of connexion, either in the same direction or in\r\ncontrary directions at pleasure. In this manner two streams could be\r\nobtained, both of which could be stopped simultaneously, because the\r\ndisjunction could be broken at G or F by removing a single wire. When the\r\nhelices were in contrary directions, there was scarcely a sensible spark at\r\nthe place of disjunction; but when they were in accordance there was a very\r\nbright one.\r\n\r\n1099. The helix i was now used constantly, being sometimes associated, as\r\nabove, with helix ii in an according direction, and sometimes with helix\r\niii, which was placed at a little distance. The association i and ii, which\r\npresented two currents able to affect each other by induction, because of\r\ntheir vicinity, gave a brighter spark than the association i and iii, where\r\nthe two streams could not exert their mutual influence; but the difference\r\nwas not so great as I expected.\r\n\r\n1100. Thus all the phenomena tend to prove that the effects are due to an\r\ninductive action, occurring at the moment when the principal current is\r\nstopped. I at one time thought they were due to an action continued during\r\nthe _whole time_ of the current, and expected that a steel magnet would\r\nhave an influence according to its position in the helix, comparable to\r\nthat of a soft iron bar, in assisting the effect. This, however, is not the\r\ncase; for hard steel, or a magnet in the helix, is not so effectual as soft\r\niron; nor does it make any difference how the magnet is placed in the\r\nhelix, and for very simple reasons, namely, that the effect does not depend\r\nupon a permanent state of the core, but a _change of state_; and that the\r\nmagnet or hard steel cannot sink through such a difference of state as soft\r\niron, at the moment contact ceases, and therefore cannot produce an equal\r\neffect in generating a current of electricity by induction (34. 37.).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1101. As an electric current acts by induction with equal energy at the\r\nmoment of its commencement as at the moment of its cessation (10. 26.), but\r\nin a contrary direction, the reference of the effects under examination to\r\nan inductive action, would lead to the conclusion that corresponding\r\neffects of an opposite nature must occur in a long wire, a helix, or an\r\nelectro-magnet, every time that _contact is made with_ the electromotor.\r\nThese effects will tend to establish a resistance for the first moment in\r\nthe long conductor, producing a result equivalent to the reverse of a shock\r\nor a spark. Now it is very difficult to devise means fit for the\r\nrecognition of such negative results; but as it is probable that some\r\npositive effect is produced at the time, if we knew what to expect, I think\r\nthe few facts bearing upon this subject with which I am acquainted are\r\nworth recording.\r\n\r\n1102. The electro-magnet was arranged with an electrolyzing apparatus at\r\n_x_, as before described (1084.), except that the intensity of the chemical\r\naction at the electromotor was increased until the electric current was\r\njust able to produce the feeblest signs of decomposition whilst contact was\r\ncontinued at G and E (1079.); (the iodine of course appearing against the\r\nend of the cross wire P;) the wire N was also separated from A at _r_, so\r\nthat contact there could be made or broken at pleasure. Under these\r\ncircumstances the following set of actions was repeated several times:\r\ncontact was broken at _r_, then broken at G, next made at _r_, and lastly\r\nrenewed at G; thus any current from N to P due to _breaking_ of contact was\r\navoided, but any additional force to the current from P to N due to\r\n_making_ contact could be observed. In this way it was found, that a much\r\ngreater decomposing effect (causing the evolution of iodine against P)\r\ncould be obtained by a few completions of contact than by the current which\r\ncould pass in a much longer time if the contact was _continued_. This I\r\nattribute to the act of induction in the wire ABD at the moment of contact\r\nrendering that wire a worse conductor, or rather retarding the passage of\r\nthe electricity through it for the instant, and so throwing a greater\r\nquantity of the electricity which the electromotor could produce, through\r\nthe cross wire passage NP. The instant the induction ceased, ABD resumed\r\nits full power of carrying a constant current of electricity, and could\r\nhave it highly increased, as we know by the former experiments (1060.) by\r\nthe opposite inductive action brought into activity at the moment contact\r\nat Z or C was _broken_.\r\n\r\n1103. A galvanometer was then introduced at _x_, and the deflection of the\r\nneedle noted whilst contact was continued at G and E: the needle was then\r\nblocked as before in one direction (1087.), so that it should not return\r\nwhen the current ceased, but remain in the position in which the current\r\ncould retain it. Contact at G or E was broken, producing of course no\r\nvisible effect; it was then renewed, and the needle was instantly\r\ndeflected, passing from the blocking pins to a position still further from\r\nits natural place than that which the constant current could give, and thus\r\nshowing, by the temporary excess of current in this cross communication,\r\nthe temporary retardation in the circuit ABD.\r\n\r\n1104. On adjusting a platina wire at _x_ (1081.) so that it should not be\r\nignited by the current passing through it whilst contact at G and E was\r\n_continued_, and yet become red-hot by a current somewhat more powerful, I\r\nwas readily able to produce its ignition upon _making contact_, and again\r\nupon _breaking contact_. Thus the momentary retardation in ABD on making\r\ncontact was again shown by this result, as well also as the opposite result\r\nupon breaking contact. The two ignitions of the wire at _x_ were of course\r\nproduced by electric currents moving in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n1105. Using the _helix_ only, I could not obtain distinct deflections at\r\n_x_, due to the extra effect on making contact, for the reasons already\r\nmentioned (1088.). By using a very fine platina wire there (1083.), I did\r\nsucceed in obtaining the igniting effect for making contact in the same\r\nmanner, though by no means to the same degree, as with the electro-magnet\r\n(1104).\r\n\r\n1106. We may also consider and estimate the effect on _making contact_, by\r\ntransferring the force of induction from the wire carrying the original\r\ncurrent to a lateral wire, as in the cases described (1090.); and we then\r\nare sure, both by the chemical and galvanometrical results (1091.), that\r\nthe forces upon making and breaking contact, like action and reaction, are\r\nequal in their strength but contrary in their direction. If, therefore, the\r\neffect on making contact resolves itself into a mere retardation of the\r\ncurrent at the first moment of its existence, it must be, in its degree,\r\nequivalent to the high exaltation of that same current at the moment\r\ncontact is broken.\r\n\r\n1107. Thus the case, under the circumstances, is, that the intensity and\r\nquantity of electricity moving in a current are smaller when the current\r\ncommences or is increased, and greater when it diminishes or ceases, than\r\nthey would be if the inductive action occurring at these moments did not\r\ntake place; or than they are in the original current wire if the inductive\r\naction be transferred from that wire to a collateral one (1090.).\r\n\r\n1108. From the facility of transference to neighbouring wires, and from the\r\neffects generally, the inductive forces appear to be lateral, i.e. exerted\r\nin a direction perpendicular to the direction of the originating and\r\nproduced currents: and they also appear to be accurately represented by the\r\nmagnetic curves, and closely related to, if not identical with, magnetic\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n1109. There can be no doubt that the current in one part of a wire can act\r\nby induction upon other parts of the _same_ wire which are lateral to the\r\nfirst, i.e. in the same vertical section (74.), or in the parts which are\r\nmore or less oblique to it (1112.), just as it can act in producing a\r\ncurrent in a neighbouring wire or in a neighbouring coil of the same wire.\r\nIt is this which gives the appearance of the current acting upon itself:\r\nbut all the experiments and all analogy tend to show that the elements (if\r\nI may so say) of the currents do not act upon themselves, and so cause the\r\neffect in question, but produce it by exciting currents in conducting\r\nmatter which is lateral to them.\r\n\r\n1110. It is possible that some of the expressions I have used may seem to\r\nimply, that the inductive action is essentially the action of one current\r\nupon another, or of one element of a current upon another element of the\r\nsame current. To avoid any such conclusion I must explain more distinctly\r\nmy meaning. If an endless wire be taken, we have the means of generating a\r\ncurrent in it which shall run round the circuit without adding any\r\nelectricity to what was previously in the wire. As far as we can judge, the\r\nelectricity which appears as a current is the same as that which before was\r\nquiescent in the wire; and though we cannot as yet point out the essential\r\ncondition of difference of the electricity at such times, we can easily\r\nrecognize the two states. Now when a current acts by induction upon\r\nconducting matter lateral to it, it probably acts upon the electricity in\r\nthat conducting matter whether it be in the form of a _current_ or\r\n_quiescent_, in the one case increasing or diminishing the current\r\naccording to its direction, in the other producing a current, and the\r\n_amount_ of the inductive action is probably the same in both cases. Hence,\r\nto say that the action of induction depended upon the mutual relation of\r\ntwo or more currents, would, according to the restricted sense in which the\r\nterm current is understood at present (283. 517. 667.), be an error.\r\n\r\n1111. Several of the effects, as, for instances, those with helices(1066.),\r\nwith according or counter currents (1097. 1098.), and those on the\r\nproduction of lateral currents (1090.), appeared to indicate that a current\r\ncould produce an effect of induction in a neighbouring wire more readily\r\nthan in its own carrying wire, in which case it might be expected that some\r\nvariation of result would be produced if a bundle of wires were used as a\r\nconductor instead of a single wire. In consequence the following\r\nexperiments were made. A copper wire one twenty-third of an inch in\r\ndiameter was cut into lengths of five feet each, and six of these being\r\nlaid side by side in one bundle, had their opposite extremities soldered to\r\ntwo terminal pieces of copper. This arrangement could be used as a\r\ndischarging wire, but the general current could be divided into six\r\nparallel streams, which might be brought close together, or, by the\r\nseparation of the wires, be taken more or less out of each other's\r\ninfluence. A somewhat brighter spark was, I think, obtained on breaking\r\ncontact when the six wires were close together than when held asunder.\r\n\r\n1112. Another bundle, containing twenty of these wires, was eighteen feet\r\nlong: the terminal pieces were one-fifth of an inch in diameter, and each\r\nsix inches long. This was compared with nineteen feet in length of copper\r\nwire one-fifth of an inch in diameter. The bundle gave a smaller spark on\r\nbreaking contact than the latter, even when its strands were held together\r\nby string: when they were separated, it gave a still smaller spark. Upon\r\nthe whole, however, the diminution of effect was not such as I expected:\r\nand I doubt whether the results can be considered as any proof of the truth\r\nof the supposition which gave rise to them.\r\n\r\n1113. The inductive force by which two elements of one current (1109.\r\n1110.) act upon each other, appears to diminish as the line joining them\r\nbecomes oblique to the direction of the current and to vanish entirely when\r\nit is parallel. I am led by some results to suspect that it then even\r\npasses into the repulsive force noticed by Ampère[A]; which is the cause of\r\nthe elevations in mercury described by Sir Humphry Davy[B], and which again\r\nis probably directly connected with the quality of intensity.\r\n\r\n  [A] Recueil d'Observations Electro-Dynamiques, p. 285.\r\n\r\n  [B] Philosophical Transactions, 1823, p. 155.\r\n\r\n1114. Notwithstanding that the effects appear only at the making and\r\nbreaking of contact, (the current remaining unaffected, seemingly, in the\r\ninterval,) I cannot resist the impression that there is some connected and\r\ncorrespondent effect produced by this lateral action of the elements of the\r\nelectric stream during the time of its continuance (60. 242.). An action of\r\nthis kind, in fact, is evident in the magnetic relations of the parts of\r\nthe current. But admitting (as we may do for the moment) the magnetic\r\nforces to constitute the power which produces such striking and different\r\nresults at the commencement and termination of a current, still there\r\nappears to be a link in the chain of effects, a wheel in the physical\r\nmechanism of the action, as yet unrecognised. If we endeavour to consider\r\nelectricity and magnetism as the results of two forces of a physical agent,\r\nor a peculiar condition of matter, exerted in determinate directions\r\nperpendicular to each other, then, it appears to me, that we must consider\r\nthese two states or forces as convertible into each other in a greater or\r\nsmaller degree; i.e. that an element of an electric current has not a\r\ndeterminate electric force and a determinate magnetic force constantly\r\nexisting in the same ratio, but that the two forces are, to a certain\r\ndegree, convertible by a process or change of condition at present unknown\r\nto us. How else can a current of a given intensity and quantity be able, by\r\nits direct action, to sustain a state which, when allowed to react, (at the\r\ncessation of the original current,) shall produce a second current, having\r\nan intensity and quantity far greater than the generating one? This cannot\r\nresult from a direct reaction of the electric force; and if it result from\r\na change of electrical into magnetic force, and a reconversion back again,\r\nit will show that they differ in something more than mere direction, as\r\nregards _that agent_ in the conducting wire which constitutes their\r\nimmediate cause.\r\n\r\n1115. With reference to the appearance, at different times, of the contrary\r\neffects produced by the making and breaking contact, and their separation\r\nby an intermediate and indifferent state, this separation is probably more\r\napparent than real. If the conduction of electricity be effected by\r\nvibrations (283.), or by any other mode in which opposite forces are\r\nsuccessively and rapidly excited and neutralized, then we might expect a\r\npeculiar and contrary development of force at the commencement and\r\ntermination of the periods during which the conducting action should last\r\n(somewhat in analogy with the colours produced at the outside of an\r\nimperfectly developed solar spectrum): and the intermediate actions,\r\nalthough not sensible in the same way, may be very important and, for\r\ninstance, perhaps constitute the very essence of conductibility. It is by\r\nviews and reasons such as these, which seem to me connected with the\r\nfundamental laws and facts of electrical science, that I have been induced\r\nto enter, more minutely than I otherwise should have done, into the\r\nexperimental examination of the phenomena described in this paper.\r\n\r\n1116. Before concluding, I may briefly remark, that on using a voltaic\r\nbattery of fifty pairs of plates instead of a single pair (1052.), the\r\neffects were exactly of the same kind. The spark on making contact, for the\r\nreasons before given, was very small (1101. 1107.); that on breaking\r\ncontact, very excellent and brilliant. The _continuous_ discharge did not\r\nseem altered in character, whether a short wire or the powerful\r\nelectro-magnet were used as a connecting discharger.\r\n\r\n1117. The effects produced at the commencement and end of a current, (which\r\nare separated by an interval of time when that current is supplied from a\r\nvoltaic apparatus,) must occur at the same moment when a common electric\r\ndischarge is passed through a long wire. Whether, if happening accurately\r\nat the same moment, they would entirely neutralize each other, or whether\r\nthey would not still give some definite peculiarity to the discharge, is a\r\nmatter remaining to be examined; but it is very probable that the peculiar\r\ncharacter and pungency of sparks drawn from a long wire depend in part upon\r\nthe increased intensity given at the termination of the discharge by the\r\ninductive action then occurring.\r\n\r\n1118. In the wire of the helix of magneto-electric machines, (as, for\r\ninstance, in Mr. Saxton's beautiful arrangement,) an important influence of\r\nthese principles of action is evidently shown. From the construction of the\r\napparatus the current is permitted to move in a complete metallic circuit\r\nof great length during the first instants of its formation: it gradually\r\nrises in strength, and is then suddenly stopped by the breaking of the\r\nmetallic circuit; and thus great intensity is given _by induction_ to the\r\nelectricity, which at that moment passes (1064. 1060.). This intensity is\r\nnot only shown by the brilliancy of the spark and the strength of the\r\nshock, but also by the necessity which has been experienced of\r\nwell-insulating the convolutions of the helix, in which the current is\r\nformed: and it gives to the current a force at these moments very far above\r\nthat which the apparatus could produce if the principle which forms the\r\nsubject of this paper were not called into play.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nDecember 8th, 1834._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16. _On an improved form of the Voltaic Battery._ § 17. _Some practical\r\nresults respecting the construction and use of the Voltaic Battery._\r\n\r\nReceived June 16,--Read June 18, 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n1119. I Have lately had occasion to examine the voltaic trough practically,\r\nwith a view to improvements in its construction and use; and though I do\r\nnot pretend that the results have anything like the importance which\r\nattaches to the discovery of a new law or principle, I still think they are\r\nvaluable, and may therefore, if briefly told, and in connexion with former\r\npapers, be worthy the approbation of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n§ 16. _On an improved form of the Voltaic Battery._\r\n\r\n\r\n1120. In a simple voltaic circuit (and the same is true of the battery) the\r\nchemical forces which, during their activity, give power to the instrument,\r\nare generally divided into two portions; one of these is exerted locally,\r\nwhilst the other is transferred round the circle (947. 996.); the latter\r\nconstitutes the electric current of the instrument, whilst the former is\r\naltogether lost or wasted. The ratio of these two portions of power may be\r\nvaried to a great extent by the influence of circumstances: thus, in a\r\nbattery not closed, _all_ the action is local; in one of the ordinary\r\nconstruction, _much_ is in circulation when the extremities are in\r\ncommunication: and in the perfect one, which I have described (1001.),\r\n_all_ the chemical power circulates and becomes electricity. By referring\r\nto the quantity of zinc dissolved from the plates (865. 1120.), and the\r\nquantity of decomposition effected in the volta-electrometer (711. 1126,)\r\nor elsewhere, the proportions of the local and transferred actions under\r\nany particular circumstances can be ascertained, and the efficacy of the\r\nvoltaic arrangement, or the waste of chemical power at its zinc plates, be\r\naccurately determined.\r\n\r\n1121. If a voltaic battery were constructed of zinc and platina, the latter\r\nmetal surrounding the former, as in the double copper arrangement, and the\r\nwhole being excited by dilute sulphuric acid, then no insulating divisions\r\nof glass, porcelain or air would be required between the contiguous platina\r\nsurfaces; and, provided these did not touch metallically, the same acid\r\nwhich, being between the zinc and platina, would excite the battery into\r\npowerful action, would, between the two surfaces of platina, produce no\r\ndischarge of the electricity, nor cause any diminution of the power of the\r\ntrough. This is a necessary consequence of the resistance to the passage of\r\nthe current which I have shown occurs at the place of decomposition (1007.\r\n1011.); for that resistance is fully able to stop the current, and\r\ntherefore acts as insulation to the electricity of the contiguous plates,\r\ninasmuch as the current which tends to pass between them never has a higher\r\nintensity than that due to the action of a single pair.\r\n\r\n1122. If the metal surrounding the zinc be copper (1045.), and if the acid\r\nbe nitro-sulphuric acid (1020.), then a slight discharge between the two\r\ncontiguous coppers does take place, provided there be no other channel open\r\nby which the forces may circulate; but when such a channel is permitted,\r\nthe return or back discharge of which I speak is exceedingly diminished, in\r\naccordance with the principles laid down in the Eighth Series of these\r\nResearches.\r\n\r\n1123. Guided by these principles I was led to the construction of a voltaic\r\ntrough, in which the coppers, passing round both surfaces of the zincs, as\r\nin Wollaston's construction, should not be separated from each other except\r\nby an intervening thickness of paper, or in some other way, so as to\r\nprevent metallic contact, and should thus constitute an instrument compact,\r\npowerful, economical, and easy of use. On examining, however, what had been\r\ndone before, I found that the new trough was in all essential respects the\r\nsame as that invented and described by Dr. Hare, Professor in the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, to whom I have great pleasure in referring it.\r\n\r\n1124. Dr. Hare has fully described his trough[A]. In it the contiguous\r\ncopper plates are separated by thin veneers of wood, and the acid is poured\r\non to, or off, the plates by a quarter revolution of an axis, to which both\r\nthe trough containing the plates, and another trough to collect and hold\r\nthe liquid, are fixed. This arrangement I have found the most convenient of\r\nany, and have therefore adopted it. My zinc plates were cut from rolled\r\nmetal, and when soldered to the copper plates had the form delineated, fig.\r\n1. These were then bent over a gauge into the form fig. 2, and when packed\r\nin the wooden box constructed to receive them, were arranged as in fig.\r\n3[B], little plugs of cork being used to keep the zinc plates from touching\r\nthe copper plates, and a single or double thickness of cartridge paper\r\nbeing interposed between the contiguous surfaces of copper to prevent them\r\nfrom coming in contact. Such was the facility afforded by this arrangement,\r\nthat a trough of forty pairs of plates could be unpacked in five minutes,\r\nand repacked again in half an hour; and the whole series was not more than\r\nfifteen inches in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Magazine, 1824, vol. lxiii. p. 241; or Silliman's\r\n  Journal, vol. vii. See also a previous paper by Dr. Hare, Annals of\r\n  Philosophy, 1821, vol. i. p. 329, in which he speaks of the\r\n  non-necessity of insulation between the coppers.\r\n\r\n  [B] The papers between the coppers are, for the sake of distinctness,\r\n  omitted in the figure.\r\n\r\n1125. This trough, of forty pairs of plates three inches square, was\r\ncompared, as to the ignition of a platina wire, the discharge between\r\npoints of charcoal, the shock on the human frame, &c., with forty pairs of\r\nfour-inch plates having double coppers, and used in porcelain troughs\r\ndivided into insulating cells, the strength of the acid employed to excite\r\nboth being the same. In all these effects the former appeared quite equal\r\nto the latter. On comparing a second trough of the new construction,\r\ncontaining twenty pairs of four-inch plates, with twenty pairs of four-inch\r\nplates in porcelain troughs, excited by acid of the same strength, the new\r\ntrough appeared to surpass the old one in producing these effects,\r\nespecially in the ignition of wire.\r\n\r\n1126. In these experiments the new trough diminished in its energy much\r\nmore rapidly than the one on the old construction, and this was a necessary\r\nconsequence of the smaller quantity of acid used to excite it, which in the\r\ncase of the forty pairs of new construction was only one-seventh part of\r\nthat used for the forty pairs in the porcelain troughs. To compare,\r\ntherefore, both forms of the voltaic trough in their decomposing powers,\r\nand to obtain accurate data as to their relative values, experiments of the\r\nfollowing kind were made. The troughs were charged with a known quantity of\r\nacid of a known strength; the electric current was passed through a\r\nvolta-electrometer (711.) having electrodes 4 inches long and 2.3 inches in\r\nwidth, so as to oppose as little obstruction as possible to the current;\r\nthe gases evolved were collected and measured, and gave the quantity of\r\nwater decomposed. Then the whole of the charge used was mixed together, and\r\na known part of it analyzed, by being precipitated and boiled with excess\r\nof carbonate of soda, and the precipitate well-washed, dried, ignited, and\r\nweighed. In this way the quantity of metal oxidized and dissolved by the\r\nacid was ascertained; and the part removed from each zinc plate, or from\r\nall the plates, could be estimated and compared with the water decomposed\r\nin the volta-electrometer. To bring these to one standard of comparison, I\r\nhave reduced the results so as to express the loss at the plates in\r\nequivalents of zinc for the equivalent of water decomposed at the\r\nvolta-electrometer: I have taken the equivalent number of water as 9, and\r\nof zinc as 32.5, and have considered 100 cubic inches of the mixed oxygen\r\nand hydrogen, as they were collected over a pneumatic trough, to result\r\nfrom the decomposition of 12.68 grains of water.\r\n\r\n1127. The acids used in these experiments were three,--sulphuric, nitric,\r\nand muriatic. The sulphuric acid was strong oil of vitriol; one cubical\r\ninch of it was equivalent to 486 grains of marble. The nitric acid was very\r\nnearly pure; one cubical inch dissolved 150 grains of marble. The muriatic\r\nacid was also nearly pure, and one cubical inch dissolved 108 grains of\r\nmarble. These were always mixed with water by volumes, the standard of\r\nvolume being a cubical inch.\r\n\r\n1128. An acid was prepared consisting of 200 parts water, 4-1/2 parts\r\nsulphuric acid, and 4 parts nitric acid; and with this both my trough\r\ncontaining forty pairs of three-inch plates, and four porcelain troughs,\r\narranged in succession, each containing ten pairs of plates with double\r\ncoppers four inches square, were charged. These two batteries were then\r\nused in succession, and the action of each was allowed to continue for\r\ntwenty or thirty minutes, until the charge was nearly exhausted, the\r\nconnexion with the volta-electrometer being carefully preserved during the\r\nwhole time, and the acid in the troughs occasionally mixed together. In\r\nthis way the former trough acted so well, that for each equivalent of water\r\ndecomposed in the volta-electrometer only from 2 to 2.5 equivalents of zinc\r\nwere dissolved from each plate. In four experiments the average was 2.21\r\nequivalents for each plate, or 88.4 for the whole battery. In the\r\nexperiments with the porcelain troughs, the equivalents of consumption at\r\neach plate were 3.51, or 141.6 for the whole battery. In a perfect voltaic\r\nbattery of forty pairs of plates (991. 1001.) the consumption would have\r\nbeen one equivalent for each zinc plate, or forty for the whole.\r\n\r\n1129. Similar experiments were made with two voltaic batteries, one\r\ncontaining twenty pairs of four-inch plates, arranged as I have described\r\n(1124.), and the other twenty pairs of four-inch plates in porcelain\r\ntroughs. The average of five experiments with the former was a consumption\r\nof 3.7 equivalents of zinc from each plate, or 74 from the whole: the\r\naverage of three experiments with the latter was 5.5 equivalents from each\r\nplate, or 110 from the whole: to obtain this conclusion two experiments\r\nwere struck out, which were much against the porcelain troughs, and in\r\nwhich some unknown deteriorating influence was supposed to be accidentally\r\nactive. In all the experiments, care was taken not to compare _new_ and\r\n_old_ plates together, as that would have introduced serious errors into\r\nthe conclusions (1146.).\r\n\r\n1130. When ten pairs of the new arrangement were used, the consumption of\r\nzinc at each plate was 6.76 equivalents, or 67.6 for the whole. With ten\r\npairs of the common construction, in a porcelain trough, the zinc oxidized\r\nwas, upon an average, 15.5 equivalents each plate, or 155 for the entire\r\ntrough.\r\n\r\n1131. No doubt, therefore, can remain of the equality or even the great\r\nsuperiority of this form of voltaic battery over the best previously in\r\nuse, namely, that with double coppers, in which the cells are insulated.\r\nThe insulation of the coppers may therefore be dispensed with; and it is\r\nthat circumstance which principally permits of such other alterations in\r\nthe construction of the trough as gives it its practical advantages.\r\n\r\n1132. The advantages of this form of trough are very numerous and great. i.\r\nIt is exceedingly compact, for 100 pairs of plates need not occupy a trough\r\nof more than three feet in length, ii. By Dr. Hare's plan of making the\r\ntrough turn upon copper pivots which rest upon copper bearings, the latter\r\nafford _fixed_ terminations; and these I have found it very convenient to\r\nconnect with two cups of mercury, fastened in the front of the stand of the\r\ninstrument. These fixed terminations give the great advantage of arranging\r\nan apparatus to be used in connexion with the battery _before_ the latter\r\nis put into action, iii. The trough is put into readiness for use in an\r\ninstant, a single jug of dilute acid being sufficient for the charge of 100\r\npairs of four-inch plates, iv. On making the trough pass through a quarter\r\nof a revolution, it becomes active, and the great advantage is obtained of\r\nprocuring for the experiment the effect of the _first contact_ of the zinc\r\nand acid, which is twice or sometimes even thrice that which the battery\r\ncan produce a minute or two after (1036. 1150.). v. When the experiment is\r\ncompleted, the acid can be at once poured from between the plates, so that\r\nthe battery is never left to waste during an unconnected state of its\r\nextremities; the acid is not unnecessarily exhausted; the zinc is not\r\nuselessly consumed; and, besides avoiding these evils, the charge is mixed\r\nand rendered uniform, which produces a great and good result (1039.); and,\r\nupon proceeding to a second experiment, the important effect of _first\r\ncontact_ is again obtained. vi. The saving of zinc is very great. It is not\r\nmerely that, whilst in action, the zinc performs more voltaic duty (1128.\r\n1129.), but _all_ the destruction which takes place with the ordinary forms\r\nof battery between the experiments is prevented. This saving is of such\r\nextent, that I estimate the zinc in the new form of battery to be thrice as\r\neffective as that in the ordinary form. vii. The importance of this saving\r\nof metal is not merely that the value of the zinc is saved, but that the\r\nbattery is much lighter and more manageable; and also that the surfaces of\r\nthe zinc and copper plates may be brought much nearer to each other when\r\nthe battery is constructed, and remain so until it is worn out: the latter\r\nis a very important advantage (1148.). viii. Again, as, in consequence of\r\nthe saving, thinner plates will perform the duty of thick ones, rolled zinc\r\nmay be used; and I have found rolled zinc superior to cast zinc in action;\r\na superiority which I incline to attribute to its greater purity (1144.).\r\nix. Another advantage is obtained in the economy of the acid used, which is\r\nproportionate to the diminution of the zinc dissolved. x. The acid also is\r\nmore easily exhausted, and is in such small quantity that there is never\r\nany occasion to return an old charge into use. The acid of old charges\r\nwhilst out of use, often dissolves portions of copper from the black\r\nflocculi usually mingled with it, which are derived from the zinc; now any\r\nportion of copper in solution in the charge does great harm, because, by\r\nthe _local_ action of the acid and zinc, it tends to precipitate upon the\r\nlatter, and diminish its voltaic efficacy (1145.). xi. By using a due\r\nmixture of nitric and sulphuric acid for the charge (1139.), no gas is\r\nevolved from the troughs; so that a battery of several hundred pairs of\r\nplates may, without inconvenience, be close to the experimenter. xii. If,\r\nduring a series of experiments, the acid becomes exhausted, it can be\r\nwithdrawn, and replaced by other acid with the utmost facility; and after\r\nthe experiments are concluded, the great advantage of easily washing the\r\nplates is at command. And it appears to me, that in place of making, under\r\ndifferent circumstances, mutual sacrifices of comfort, power, and economy,\r\nto obtain a desired end, all are at once obtained by Dr. Hare's form of\r\ntrough.\r\n\r\n1133. But there are some disadvantages which I have not yet had time to\r\novercome, though I trust they will finally be conquered. One is the extreme\r\ndifficulty of making a wooden trough constantly water-tight under the\r\nalternations of wet and dry to which the voltaic instrument is subject. To\r\nremedy this evil, Mr. Newman is now engaged in obtaining porcelain troughs.\r\nThe other disadvantage is a precipitation of copper on the zinc plates. It\r\nappears to me to depend mainly on the circumstance that the papers between\r\nthe coppers retain acid when the trough is emptied; and that this acid\r\nslowly acting on the copper, forms a salt, which gradually mingles with the\r\nnext charge, and is reduced on the zinc plate by the local action (1120.):\r\nthe power of the whole battery is then reduced. I expect that by using\r\nslips of glass or wood to separate the coppers at their edges, their\r\ncontact can be sufficiently prevented, and the space between them be left\r\nso open that the acid of a charge can be poured and washed out, and so be\r\nremoved from _every part_ of the trough when the experiments in which the\r\nlatter is used are completed.\r\n\r\n1134. The actual superiority of the troughs which I have constructed on\r\nthis plan, I believe to depend, first and principally, on the closer\r\napproximation of the zinc and copper surfaces;--in my troughs they are only\r\none-tenth of an inch apart (1148.);--and, next, on the superior quality of\r\nthe rolled zinc above the cast zinc used in the construction of the\r\nordinary pile. It cannot be that insulation between the contiguous coppers\r\nis a disadvantage, but I do not find that it is any advantage; for when,\r\nwith both the forty pairs of three-inch plates and the twenty pairs of\r\nfour-inch plates, I used papers well-soaked in wax[A], these being so large\r\nthat when folded at the edges they wrapped over each other, so as to make\r\ncells as insulating as those of the porcelain troughs, still no sensible\r\nadvantage in the chemical action was obtained.\r\n\r\n  [A] A single paper thus prepared could insulate the electricity of a\r\n  trough of forty pairs of plates.\r\n\r\n1135. As, upon principle, there must be a discharge of part of the\r\nelectricity from the edges of the zinc and copper plates at the sides of\r\nthe trough, I should prefer, and intend having, troughs constructed with a\r\nplate or plates of crown glass at the sides of the trough: the bottom will\r\nneed none, though to glaze that and the ends would be no disadvantage. The\r\nplates need not be fastened in, but only set in their places; nor need they\r\nbe in large single pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 17. _Some practical results respecting the construction and use of the\r\nVoltaic Battery_ (1034. &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n1136. The electro-chemical philosopher is well acquainted with some\r\npractical results obtained from the voltaic battery by MM.. Gay-Lussac and\r\nThenard, and given in the first forty-five pages of their 'Recherches\r\nPhysico-Chimiques'. Although the following results are generally of the\r\nsame nature, yet the advancement made in this branch of science of late\r\nyears, the knowledge of the definite action of electricity, and the more\r\naccurate and philosophical mode of estimating the results by the\r\nequivalents of zinc consumed, will be their sufficient justification.\r\n\r\n1137. _Nature and strength of the acid._--My battery of forty pairs of\r\nthree-inch plates was charged with acid consisting of 200 parts water and 9\r\noil of vitriol. Each plate lost, in the average of the experiments, 4.66\r\nequivalents of zinc for the equivalent of water decomposed in the\r\nvolta-electrometer, or the whole battery 186.4 equivalents of zinc. Being\r\ncharged with a mixture of 200 water and 16 of the muriatic acid, each plate\r\nlost 3.8, equivalents of zinc for the water decomposed, or the whole\r\nbattery 152 equivalents of zinc. Being charged with a mixture of 200 water\r\nand 8 nitric acid, each plate lost 1.85, equivalents of zinc for one\r\nequivalent of water decomposed, or the whole battery 74.16 equivalents of\r\nzinc. The sulphuric and muriatic acids evolved much hydrogen at the plates\r\nin the trough; the nitric acid no gas whatever. The relative strengths of\r\nthe original acids have already been given (1127.); but a difference in\r\nthat respect makes no important difference in the results when thus\r\nexpressed by equivalents (1140.).\r\n\r\n1138. Thus nitric acid proves to be the best for this purpose; its\r\nsuperiority appears to depend upon its favouring the electrolyzation of the\r\nliquid in the cells of the trough upon the principles already explained\r\n(905. 973, 1022.), and consequently favouring the transmission of the\r\nelectricity, and therefore the production of transferable power (1120.).\r\n\r\n1139. The addition of nitric acid might, consequently, be expected to\r\nimprove sulphuric and muriatic acids. Accordingly, when the same trough was\r\ncharged with a mixture of 200 water, 9 oil of vitriol, and 4 nitric acid,\r\nthe consumption of zinc was at each plate 2.786, and for the whole battery\r\n111.5, equivalents. When the charge was 200 water, 9 oil of vitriol, and 8\r\nnitric acid, the loss per plate was 2.26, or for the whole battery 90.4,\r\nequivalents. When the trough was charged with a mixture of 200 water, 16\r\nmuriatic acid, and 6 nitric acid, the loss per plate was 2.11, or for the\r\nwhole battery 84.4, equivalents. Similar results were obtained with my\r\nbattery of twenty pairs of four-inch plates (1129.). Hence it is evident\r\nthat the nitric acid was of great service when mingled with the sulphuric\r\nacid; and the charge generally used after this time for ordinary\r\nexperiments consisted of 200 water, 4-1/2 oil of vitriol, and 4 nitric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n1140. It is not to be supposed that the different strengths of the acids\r\nproduced the differences above; for within certain limits I found the\r\nelectrolytic effects to be nearly as the strengths of the acids, so as to\r\nleave the expression of force, when given in equivalents, almost constant.\r\nThus, when the trough was charged with a mixture of 200 water and 8 nitric\r\nacid, each plate lost 1.854 equivalent of zinc. When the charge was 200\r\nwater and 16 nitric acid, the loss per plate was 1.82 equivalent. When it\r\nwas 200 water and 32 nitric acid, the loss was 2.1 equivalents. The\r\ndifferences here are not greater than happen from unavoidable\r\nirregularities, depending on other causes than the strength of acid.\r\n\r\n1141. Again, when a charge consisting of 200 water, 4-1/2 oil of vitriol,\r\nand 4 nitric acid was used, each zinc plate lost 2.16 equivalents; when the\r\ncharge with the same battery was 200 water, 9 oil of vitriol, and 8 nitric\r\nacid, each zinc plate lost 2.26 equivalents.\r\n\r\n1142. I need hardly say that no copper is dissolved during the regular\r\naction of the voltaic trough. I have found that much ammonia is formed in\r\nthe cells when nitric acid, either pure or mixed with sulphuric acid, is\r\nused. It is produced in part as a secondary result at the cathodes (663.)\r\nof the different portions of fluid constituting the necessary electrolyte,\r\nin the cells.\r\n\r\n1143. _Uniformity of the charge._--This is a most important point, as I\r\nhave already shown experimentally (1042. &c.). Hence one great advantage of\r\nDr. Hare's mechanical arrangement of his trough.\r\n\r\n1144. _Purity of the zinc._--If pure zinc could be obtained, it would be\r\nvery advantageous in the construction of the voltaic apparatus (998.). Most\r\nzincs, when put into dilute sulphuric acid, leave more or less of an\r\ninsoluble matter upon the surface in the form of a crust, which contains\r\nvarious metals, as copper, lead, zinc, iron, cadmium, &c., in the metallic\r\nstate. Such particles, by discharging part of the transferable power,\r\nrender it, as to the whole battery, local; and so diminish the effect. As\r\nan indication connected with the more or less perfect action of the\r\nbattery, I may mention that no gas ought to rise from the zinc plates. The\r\nmore gas which is generated upon these surfaces, the greater is the local\r\naction and the less the transferable force. The investing crust is also\r\ninconvenient, by preventing the displacement and renewal of the charge upon\r\nthe surface of the zinc. Such zinc as, dissolving in the cleanest manner in\r\na dilute acid, dissolves also the slowest, is the best; zinc which contains\r\nmuch copper should especially be avoided. I have generally found rolled\r\nLiege or Mosselman's zinc the purest; and to the circumstance of having\r\nused such zinc in its construction attribute in part the advantage of the\r\nnew battery (1134.).\r\n\r\n1145. _Foulness of the zinc plates._--After use, the plates of a battery\r\nshould be cleaned from the metallic powder upon their surfaces, especially\r\nif they are employed to obtain the laws of action of the battery itself.\r\nThis precaution was always attended to with the porcelain trough batteries\r\nin the experiments described (1125, &c.). If a few foul plates are mingled\r\nwith many clean ones, they make the action in the different cells\r\nirregular, and the transferable power is accordingly diminished, whilst the\r\nlocal and wasted power is increased. No old charge containing copper should\r\nbe used to excite a battery.\r\n\r\n1146. _New and old plates._--I have found voltaic batteries far more\r\npowerful when the plates were new than when they have been used two or\r\nthree times; so that a new and an used battery cannot be compared together,\r\nor even a battery with itself on the first and after times of use. My\r\ntrough of twenty pairs of four-inch plates, charged with acid consisting of\r\n200 water, 4-1/2 oil of vitriol, and 4 nitric acid, lost, upon the first\r\ntime of being used, 2.82 equivalents per plate. When used after the fourth\r\ntime with the same charge, the loss was from 3.26 to 4.47 equivalents per\r\nplate; the average being 3.7 equivalents. The first time the forty pair of\r\nplates (1124.) were used, the loss at each plate was only 1.65 equivalent;\r\nbut afterwards it became 2.16, 2.17, 2.52. The first time twenty pair of\r\nfour-inch plates in porcelain troughs were used, they lost, per plate, only\r\n3.7 equivalents; but after that, the loss was 5.25, 5.36, 5.9 equivalents.\r\nYet in all these cases the zincs had been well-cleaned from adhering\r\ncopper, &c., before each trial of power.\r\n\r\n1147. With the rolled zinc the fall in force soon appeared to become\r\nconstant, i.e. to proceed no further. But with the cast zinc plates\r\nbelonging to the porcelain troughs, it appeared to continue, until at last,\r\nwith the same charge, each plate lost above twice as much zinc for a given\r\namount of action as at first. These troughs were, however, so irregular\r\nthat I could not always determine the circumstances affecting the amount of\r\nelectrolytic action.\r\n\r\n1148. _Vicinity of the copper and zinc._--The importance of this point in\r\nthe construction of voltaic arrangements, and the greater power, as to\r\nimmediate action, which is obtained when the zinc and copper surfaces are\r\nnear to each other than when removed further apart, are well known. I find\r\nthat the power is not only greater on the instant, but also that the sum of\r\ntransferable power, in relation to the whole sum of chemical action at the\r\nplates, is much increased. The cause of this gain is very evident. Whatever\r\ntends to retard the circulation of the transferable force, (i.e. the\r\nelectricity,) diminishes the proportion of such force, and increases the\r\nproportion of that which is local (996. 1120.). Now the liquid in the cells\r\npossesses this retarding power, and therefore acts injuriously, in greater\r\nor less proportion, according to the quantity of it between the zinc and\r\ncopper plates, i.e. according to the distances between their surfaces. A\r\ntrough, therefore, in which the plates are only half the distance asunder\r\nat which they are placed in another, will produce more transferable, and\r\nless local, force than the latter; and thus, because the electrolyte in the\r\ncells can transmit the current more readily; both the intensity and\r\nquantity of electricity is increased for a given consumption of zinc. To\r\nthis circumstance mainly I attribute the superiority of the trough I have\r\ndescribed (1134.).\r\n\r\n1149. The superiority of _double coppers_ over single plates also depends\r\nin part upon diminishing the resistance offered by the electrolyte between\r\nthe metals. For, in fact, with double coppers the sectional area of the\r\ninterposed acid becomes nearly double that with single coppers, and\r\ntherefore it more freely transfers the electricity. Double coppers are,\r\nhowever, effective, mainly because they virtually double the acting surface\r\nof the zinc, or nearly so; for in a trough with single copper plates and\r\nthe usual construction of cells, that surface of zinc which is not opposed\r\nto a copper surface is thrown almost entirely out of voltaic action, yet\r\nthe acid continues to act upon it and the metal is dissolved, producing\r\nvery little more than local effect (947. 996). But when by doubling the\r\ncopper, that metal is opposed to the second surface of the zinc plate, then\r\na great part of the action upon the latter is converted into transferable\r\nforce, and thus the power of the trough as to quantity of electricity is\r\nhighly exalted.\r\n\r\n1150. _First immersion of the plates._--The great effect produced at the\r\nfirst immersion of the plates, (apart from their being new or used\r\n(1146.),) I have attributed elsewhere to the unchanged condition of the\r\nacid in contact with the zinc plate (1003. 1037.): as the acid becomes\r\nneutralized, its exciting power is proportionally diminished. Hare's form\r\nof trough secures much advantage of this kind, by mingling the liquid, and\r\nbringing what may be considered as a fresh surface of acid against the\r\nplates every time it is used immediately after a rest.\r\n\r\n1151. _Number of plates._[A]--The most advantageous number of plates in a\r\nbattery used for chemical decomposition, depends almost entirely upon the\r\nresistance to be overcome at the place of action; but whatever that\r\nresistance may be, there is a certain number which is more economical than\r\neither a greater or a less. Ten pairs of four-inch plates in a porcelain\r\ntrough of the ordinary construction, acting in the volta-electrometer\r\n(1126.) upon dilute sulphuric acid of spec. grav. 1.314, gave an average\r\nconsumption of 15.4 equivalents per plate, or 154 equivalents on the whole.\r\nTwenty pairs of the same plates, with the same acid, gave only a\r\nconsumption of 5.5 per plate, or 110 equivalents upon the whole. When forty\r\npairs of the same plates were used, the consumption was 3.54 equivalents\r\nper plate, or 141.6 upon the whole battery. Thus the consumption of zinc\r\narranged as _twenty_ plates was more advantageous than if arranged either\r\nas _ten_ or as _forty_.\r\n\r\n  [A] Gay-Lussac and Thenard, Recherches Physico-Chimiques, tom. i. p. 29.\r\n\r\n1152. Again, ten pairs of my four-inch plates (1129.) lost 6.76 each, or\r\nthe whole ten 67.6 equivalents of zinc, in effecting decomposition; whilst\r\ntwenty pairs of the same plates, excited by the same acid, lost 3.7\r\nequivalents each, or on the whole 74 equivalents. In other comparative\r\nexperiments of numbers, ten pairs of the three inch-plates, (1125.) lost\r\n3.725, or 37.25 equivalents upon the whole; whilst twenty pairs lost 2.53\r\neach, or 50.6 in all; and forty pairs lost on an average 2.21, or 88.4\r\naltogether. In both these cases, therefore, increase of numbers had not\r\nbeen advantageous as to the effective production of _transferable chemical\r\npower_ from the _whole quantity of chemical force_ active at the surfaces\r\nof excitation (1120.).\r\n\r\n1153. But if I had used a weaker acid or a worse conductor in the\r\nvolta-electrometer, then the number of plates which would produce the most\r\nadvantageous effect would have risen; or if I had used a better conductor\r\nthan that really employed in the volta-electrometer, I might have reduced\r\nthe number even to one; as, for instance, when a thick wire is used to\r\ncomplete the circuit (865., &c.). And the cause of these variations is very\r\nevident, when it is considered that each successive plate in the voltaic\r\napparatus does not add anything to the _quantity_ of transferable power or\r\nelectricity which the first plate can put into motion, provided a good\r\nconductor be present, but tends only to exalt the _intensity_ of that\r\nquantity, so as to make it more able to overcome the obstruction of bad\r\nconductors (994. 1158.).\r\n\r\n1154. _Large or small plates._[A]--The advantageous use of large or small\r\nplates for electrolyzations will evidently depend upon the facility with\r\nwhich the transferable power of electricity can pass. If in a particular\r\ncase the most effectual number of plates is known (1151.), then the\r\naddition of more zinc would be most advantageously made in increasing the\r\n_size_ of the plates, and not their _number_. At the same time, large\r\nincrease in the size of the plates would raise in a small degree the most\r\nfavourable number.\r\n\r\n  [A] Gay-Lussac and Thenard, Recherches Physico-Chimiques, tom, i. p. 20.\r\n\r\n1155. Large and small plates should not be used together in the same\r\nbattery: the small ones occasion a loss of the power of the large ones,\r\nunless they be excited by an acid proportionably more powerful; for with a\r\ncertain acid they cannot transmit the same portion of electricity in a\r\ngiven time which the same acid can evolve by action on the larger plates.\r\n\r\n1156. _Simultaneous decompositions._--When the number of plates in a\r\nbattery much surpasses the most favourable proportion (1151--1153.), two or\r\nmore decompositions may be effected simultaneously with advantage. Thus my\r\nforty pairs of plates (1124.) produced in one volta-electrometer 22.8 cubic\r\ninches of gas. Being recharged exactly in the same manner, they produced in\r\neach of two volta-electrometers 21 cubical inches. In the first experiment\r\nthe whole consumption of zinc was 88.4 equivalents, and in the second only\r\n48.28 equivalents, for the whole of the water decomposed in both\r\nvolta-electrometers.\r\n\r\n1157. But when the twenty pairs of four-inch plates (1129.) were tried in\r\na similar manner, the results were in the opposite direction. With one\r\nvolta-electrometer 52 cubic inches of gas were obtained; with two, only\r\n14.6 cubic inches from each. The quantity of charge was not the same in\r\nboth cases, though it was of the same strength; but on rendering the\r\nresults comparative by reducing them to equivalents (1126.), it was found\r\nthat the consumption of metal in the first case was 74, and in the second\r\ncase 97, equivalents for the _whole_ of the water decomposed. These\r\nresults of course depend upon the same circumstances of retardation, &c.,\r\nwhich have been referred to in speaking of the proper number of plates\r\n(1151.).\r\n\r\n1158. That the _transferring_, or, as it is usually called, _conducting,\r\npower_ of an electrolyte which is to be decomposed, or other interposed\r\nbody, should be rendered as good as possible[A], is very evident (1020.\r\n1120.). With a perfectly good conductor and a good battery, nearly all the\r\nelectricity is passed, i.e. _nearly all_ the chemical power becomes\r\ntransferable, even with a single pair of plates (807.). With an interposed\r\nnonconductor none of the chemical power becomes transferable. With an\r\nimperfect conductor more or less of the chemical power becomes transferable\r\nas the circumstances favouring the transfer of forces across the imperfect\r\nconductor are exalted or diminished: these circumstances are, actual\r\nincrease or improvement of the conducting power, enlargement of the\r\nelectrodes, approximation of the electrodes, and increased intensity of the\r\npassing current.\r\n\r\n  [A] Gay-Lussac and Thenard, Recherches Physico-Chimiques, tom. i. pp.\r\n  13, 15, 22.\r\n\r\n1159. The introduction of common spring water in place of one of the\r\nvolta-electrometers used with twenty pairs of four-inch plates (1156.)\r\ncaused such obstruction as not to allow one-fifteenth of the transferable\r\nforce to pass which would have circulated without it. Thus\r\nfourteen-fifteenths of the available force of the battery were destroyed,\r\nlocal force, (which was rendered evident by the evolution of gas from the\r\nbeing converted into zincs,) and yet the platina electrodes in the water\r\nwere three inches long, nearly an inch wide, and not a quarter of an inch\r\napart.\r\n\r\n1160. These points, i.e. the increase of conducting power, the enlargement\r\nof the electrodes, and their approximation, should be especially attended\r\nto in _volta-electrometers_.

The science of electricity is in that state in which every part of it\r\nrequires experimental investigation; not merely for the discovery of new\r\neffects, but what is just now of far more importance, the development of\r\nthe means by which the old effects are produced, and the consequent more\r\naccurate determination of the first principles of action of the most\r\nextraordinary and universal power in nature:--and to those philosophers who\r\npursue the inquiry zealously yet cautiously, combining experiment with\r\nanalogy, suspicious of their preconceived notions, paying more respect to a\r\nfact than a theory, not too hasty to generalize, and above all things,\r\nwilling at every step to cross-examine their own opinions, both by\r\nreasoning and experiment, no branch of knowledge can afford so fine and\r\nready a field for discovery as this. Such is most abundantly shown to be\r\nthe case by the progress which electricity has made in the last thirty\r\nyears: Chemistry and Magnetism have successively acknowledged its\r\nover-ruling influence; and it is probable that every effect depending upon\r\nthe powers of inorganic matter, and perhaps most of those related to\r\nvegetable and animal life, will ultimately be found subordinate to it.\r\n\r\n1162. Amongst the actions of different kinds into which electricity has\r\nconventionally been subdivided, there is, I think, none which excels, or\r\neven equals in importance, that called _Induction_. It is of the most\r\ngeneral influence in electrical phenomena, appearing to be concerned in\r\nevery one of them, and has in reality the character of a first, essential,\r\nand fundamental principle. Its comprehension is so important, that I think\r\nwe cannot proceed much further in the investigation of the laws of\r\nelectricity without a more thorough understanding of its nature; how\r\notherwise can we hope to comprehend the harmony and even unity of action\r\nwhich doubtless governs electrical excitement by friction, by chemical\r\nmeans, by heat, by magnetic influence, by evaporation, and even by the\r\nliving being?\r\n\r\n1163. In the long-continued course of experimental inquiry in which I have\r\nbeen engaged, this general result has pressed upon me constantly, namely,\r\nthe necessity of admitting two forces, or two forms or directions of a\r\nforce (516. 517.), combined with the impossibility of separating these two\r\nforces (or electricities) from each other, either in the phenomena of\r\nstatical electricity or those of the current. In association with this, the\r\nimpossibility under any circumstances, as yet, of absolutely charging\r\nmatter of any kind with one or the other electricity only, dwelt on my\r\nmind, and made me wish and search for a clearer view than any that I was\r\nacquainted with, of the way in which electrical powers and the particles of\r\nmatter are related; especially in inductive actions, upon which almost all\r\nothers appeared to rest.\r\n\r\n1164. When I discovered the general fact that electrolytes refused to yield\r\ntheir elements to a current when in the solid state, though they gave them\r\nforth freely if in the liquid condition (380. 394. 402.), I thought I saw\r\nan opening to the elucidation of inductive action, and the possible\r\nsubjugation of many dissimilar phenomena to one law. For let the\r\nelectrolyte be water, a plate of ice being coated with platina foil on its\r\ntwo surfaces, and these coatings connected with any continued source of the\r\ntwo electrical powers, the ice will charge like a Leyden arrangement,\r\npresenting a case of common induction, but no current will pass. If the ice\r\nbe liquefied, the induction will fall to a certain degree, because a\r\ncurrent can now pass; but its passing is dependent upon a _peculiar\r\nmolecular arrangement_ of the particles consistent with the transfer of the\r\nelements of the electrolyte in opposite directions, the degree of discharge\r\nand the quantity of elements evolved being exactly proportioned to each\r\nother (377. 783.). Whether the charging of the metallic coating be effected\r\nby a powerful electrical machine, a strong and large voltaic battery, or a\r\nsingle pair of plates, makes no difference in the principle, but only in\r\nthe degree of action (360). Common induction takes place in each case if\r\nthe electrolyte be solid, or if fluid, chemical action and decomposition\r\nensue, provided opposing actions do not interfere; and it is of high\r\nimportance occasionally thus to compare effects in their extreme degrees,\r\nfor the purpose of enabling us to comprehend the nature of an action in its\r\nweak state, which may be only sufficiently evident to us in its stronger\r\ncondition (451.). As, therefore, in the electrolytic action, _induction_\r\nappeared to be the _first_ step, and _decomposition_ the _second_ (the\r\npower of separating these steps from each other by giving the solid or\r\nfluid condition to the electrolyte being in our hands); as the induction\r\nwas the same in its nature as that through air, glass, wax, &c. produced by\r\nany of the ordinary means; and as the whole effect in the electrolyte\r\nappeared to be an action of the particles thrown into a peculiar or\r\npolarized state, I was led to suspect that common induction itself was in\r\nall cases an _action of contiguous particles_[A], and that electrical\r\naction at a distance (i.e. ordinary inductive action) never occurred except\r\nthrough the influence of the intervening matter.\r\n\r\n  [A] The word _contiguous_ is perhaps not the best that might have been\r\n  used here and elsewhere; for as particles do not touch each other it\r\n  is not strictly correct. I was induced to employ it, because in its\r\n  common acceptation it enabled me to state the theory plainly and with\r\n  facility. By contiguous particles I mean those which are next.--_Dec.\r\n  1838._\r\n\r\n1165. The respect which I entertain towards the names of Epinus, Cavendish,\r\nPoisson, and other most eminent men, all of whose theories I believe\r\nconsider induction as an action at a distance and in straight lines, long\r\nindisposed me to the view I have just stated; and though I always watched\r\nfor opportunities to prove the opposite opinion, and made such experiments\r\noccasionally as seemed to bear directly on the point, as, for instance, the\r\nexamination of electrolytes, solid and fluid, whilst under induction by\r\npolarized light (951. 955.), it is only of late, and by degrees, that the\r\nextreme generality of the subject has urged me still further to extend my\r\nexperiments and publish my view. At present I believe ordinary induction in\r\nall cases to be an action of contiguous particles consisting in a species\r\nof polarity, instead of being an action of either particles or masses at\r\nsensible distances; and if this be true, the distinction and establishment\r\nof such a truth must be of the greatest consequence to our further progress\r\nin the investigation of the nature of electric forces. The linked condition\r\nof electrical induction with chemical decomposition; of voltaic excitement\r\nwith chemical action; the transfer of elements in an electrolyte; the\r\noriginal cause of excitement in all cases; the nature and relation of\r\nconduction and insulation of the direct and lateral or transverse action\r\nconstituting electricity and magnetism; with many other things more or less\r\nincomprehensible at present, would all be affected by it, and perhaps\r\nreceive a full explication in their reduction under one general law.\r\n\r\n1166. I searched for an unexceptionable test of my view, not merely in the\r\naccordance of known facts with it, but in the consequences which would flow\r\nfrom it if true; especially in those which would not be consistent with the\r\ntheory of action at a distance. Such a consequence seemed to me to present\r\nitself in the direction in which inductive action could be exerted. If in\r\nstraight lines only, though not perhaps decisive, it would be against my\r\nview; but if in curved lines also, that would be a natural result of the\r\naction of contiguous particles, but, as I think, utterly incompatible with\r\naction at a distance, as assumed by the received theories, which, according\r\nto every fact and analogy we are acquainted with, is always in straight\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n1167. Again, if induction be an action of contiguous particles, and also\r\nthe first step in the process of electrolyzation (1164. 919.), there seemed\r\nreason to expect some particular relation of it to the different kinds of\r\nmatter through which it would be exerted, or something equivalent to a\r\n_specific electric induction_ for different bodies, which, if it existed,\r\nwould unequivocally prove the dependence of induction on the particles; and\r\nthough this, in the theory of Poisson and others, has never been supposed\r\nto be the case, I was soon led to doubt the received opinion, and have\r\ntaken great pains in subjecting this point to close experimental\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n1168. Another ever-present question on my mind has been, whether\r\nelectricity has an actual and independent existence as a fluid or fluids,\r\nor was a mere power of matter, like what we conceive of the attraction of\r\ngravitation. If determined either way it would be an enormous advance in\r\nour knowledge; and as having the most direct and influential bearing on my\r\nnotions, I have always sought for experiments which would in any way tend\r\nto elucidate that great inquiry. It was in attempts to prove the existence\r\nof electricity separate from matter, by giving an independent charge of\r\neither positive or negative power only, to some one substance, and the\r\nutter failure of all such attempts, whatever substance was used or whatever\r\nmeans of exciting or _evolving_ electricity were employed, that first drove\r\nme to look upon induction as an action of the particles of matter, each\r\nhaving _both_ forces developed in it in exactly equal amount. It is this\r\ncircumstance, in connection with others, which makes me desirous of placing\r\nthe remarks on absolute charge first, in the order of proof and argument,\r\nwhich I am about to adduce in favour of my view, that electric induction is\r\nan action of the contiguous particles of the insulating medium or\r\n_dielectric_[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] I use the word _dielectric_ to express that substance through or\r\n  across which the electric forces are acting.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ ii. _On the absolute charge of matter._\r\n\r\n1169. Can matter, either conducting or non-conducting, be charged with one\r\nelectric force independently of the other, in any degree, either in a\r\nsensible or latent state?\r\n\r\n1170. The beautiful experiments of Coulomb upon the equality of action of\r\n_conductors_, whatever their substance, and the residence of _all_ the\r\nelectricity upon their surfaces[A], are sufficient, if properly viewed, to\r\nprove that _conductors cannot be bodily charged_; and as yet no means of\r\ncommunicating electricity to a conductor so as to place its particles in\r\nrelation to one electricity, and not at the same time to the other in\r\nexactly equal amount, has been discovered.\r\n\r\n  [A] Mémoires de l'Académie, 1786, pp. 67. 69. 72; 1787, p. 452.\r\n\r\n1171. With regard to electrics or non-conductors, the conclusion does not\r\nat first seem so clear. They may easily be electrified bodily, either by\r\ncommunication (1247.) or excitement; but being so charged, every case in\r\nsuccession, when examined, came out to be a case of induction, and not of\r\nabsolute charge. Thus, glass within conductors could easily have parts not\r\nin contact with the conductor brought into an excited state; but it was\r\nalways found that a portion of the inner surface of the conductor was in an\r\nopposite and equivalent state, or that another part of the glass itself was\r\nin an equally opposite state, an _inductive_ charge and not an _absolute_\r\ncharge having been acquired.\r\n\r\n1172. Well-purified oil of turpentine, which I find to be an excellent\r\nliquid insulator for most purposes, was put into a metallic vessel, and,\r\nbeing insulated, an endeavour was made to charge its particles, sometimes\r\nby contact of the metal with the electrical machine, and at others by a\r\nwire dipping into the fluid within; but whatever the mode of communication,\r\nno electricity of one kind only was retained by the arrangement, except\r\nwhat appeared on the exterior surface of the metal, that portion being\r\npresent there only by an inductive action through the air to the\r\nsurrounding conductors. When the oil of turpentine was confined in glass\r\nvessels, there were at first some appearances as if the fluid did receive\r\nan absolute charge of electricity from the charging wire, but these were\r\nquickly reduced to cases of common induction jointly through the fluid, the\r\nglass, and the surrounding air.\r\n\r\n1173. I carried these experiments on with air to a very great extent. I had\r\na chamber built, being a cube of twelve feet. A slight cubical wooden frame\r\nwas constructed, and copper wire passed along and across it in various\r\ndirections, so as to make the sides a large net-work, and then all was\r\ncovered in with paper, placed in close connexion with the wires, and\r\nsupplied in every direction with bands of tin foil, that the whole might be\r\nbrought into good metallic communication, and rendered a free conductor in\r\nevery part. This chamber was insulated in the lecture-room of the Royal\r\nInstitution; a glass tube about six feet in length was passed through its\r\nside, leaving about four feet within and two feet on the outside, and\r\nthrough this a wire passed from the large electrical machine (290.) to the\r\nair within. By working the machine, the air in this chamber could be\r\nbrought into what is considered a highly electrified state (being, in fact,\r\nthe same state as that of the air of a room in which a powerful machine is\r\nin operation), and at the same time the outside of the insulated cube was\r\neverywhere strongly charged. But putting the chamber in communication with\r\nthe perfect discharging train described in a former series (292.), and\r\nworking the machine so as to bring the air within to its utmost degree of\r\ncharge if I quickly cut off the connexion with the machine, and at the same\r\nmoment or instantly after insulated the cube, the air within had not the\r\nleast power to communicate a further charge to it. If any portion of the\r\nair was electrified, as glass or other insulators may be charged (1171.),\r\nit was accompanied by a corresponding opposite action _within_ the cube,\r\nthe whole effect being merely a case of induction. Every attempt to charge\r\nair bodily and independently with the least portion of either electricity\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n1174 I put a delicate gold-leaf electrometer within the cube, and then\r\ncharged the whole by an _outside_ communication, very strongly, for some\r\ntime together; but neither during the charge or after the discharge did the\r\nelectrometer or air within show the least signs of electricity. I charged\r\nand discharged the whole arrangement in various ways, but in no case could\r\nI obtain the least indication of an absolute charge; or of one by induction\r\nin which the electricity of one kind had the smallest superiority in\r\nquantity over the other. I went into the cube and lived in it, and using\r\nlighted candles, electrometers, and all other tests of electrical states, I\r\ncould not find the least influence upon them, or indication of any thing\r\nparticular given by them, though all the time the outside of the cube was\r\npowerfully charged, and large sparks and brushes were darting off from\r\nevery part of its outer surface. The conclusion I have come to is, that\r\nnon-conductors, as well as conductors, have never yet had an absolute and\r\nindependent charge of one electricity communicated to them, and that to all\r\nappearance such a state of matter is impossible.\r\n\r\n1175. There is another view of this question which may be taken under the\r\nsupposition of the existence of an electric fluid or fluids. It may be\r\nimpossible to have one fluid or state in a free condition without its\r\nproducing by induction the other, and yet possible to have cases in which\r\nan isolated portion of matter in one condition being uncharged, shall, by a\r\nchange of state, evolve one electricity or the other: and though such\r\nevolved electricity might immediately induce the opposite state in its\r\nneighbourhood, yet the mere evolution of one electricity without the other\r\nin the _first instance_, would be a very important fact in the theories\r\nwhich assume a fluid or fluids; these theories as I understand them\r\nassigning not the slightest reason why such an effect should not occur.\r\n\r\n1176. But on searching for such cases I cannot find one. Evolution by\r\nfriction, as is well known, gives both powers in equal proportion. So does\r\nevolution by chemical action, notwithstanding the great diversity of bodies\r\nwhich may be employed, and the enormous quantity of electricity which can\r\nin this manner be evolved (371. 376. 861. 868. 961.). The more promising\r\ncases of change of state, whether by evaporation, fusion, or the reverse\r\nprocesses, still give both forms of the power in _equal_ proportion; and\r\nthe cases of splitting of mica and other crystals, the breaking of sulphur,\r\n&c., are subject to the same law of limitation.\r\n\r\n1177. As far as experiment has proceeded, it appears, therefore, impossible\r\neither to evolve or make disappear one electric force without equal and\r\ncorresponding change in the other. It is also equally impossible\r\nexperimentally to charge a portion of matter with one electric force\r\nindependently of the other. Charge always implies _induction_, for it can\r\nin no instance be effected without; and also the presence of the _two_\r\nforms of power, equally at the moment of the development and afterwards.\r\nThere is no _absolute_ charge of matter with one fluid; no latency of a\r\nsingle electricity. This though a negative result is an exceedingly\r\nimportant one, being probably the consequence of a natural impossibility,\r\nwhich will become clear to us when we understand the true condition and\r\ntheory of the electric power.\r\n\r\n1178. The preceding considerations already point to the following\r\nconclusions: bodies cannot be charged absolutely, but only relatively, and\r\nby a principle which is the same with that of _induction_. All _charge_ is\r\nsustained by induction. All phenomena of _intensity_ include the principle\r\nof induction. All _excitation_ is dependent on or directly related to\r\ninduction. All _currents_ involve previous intensity and therefore previous\r\ninduction. INDUCTION appears to be the essential function both the first\r\ndevelopment and the consequent phenomena of electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ iii. _Electrometer and inductive apparatus employed._\r\n\r\n1179. Leaving for a time the further consideration of the preceding facts\r\nuntil they can be collated with other results bearing directly on the great\r\nquestion of the nature of induction, I will now describe the apparatus I\r\nhave had occasion to use; and in proportion to the importance of the\r\nprinciples sought to be established is the necessity of doing this so\r\nclearly, as to leave no doubt of the results behind.\r\n\r\n1180. _Electrometer._--The measuring instrument I have employed has been\r\nthe torsion balance electrometer of Coulomb, constructed, generally,\r\naccording to his directions[A], but with certain variations and additions,\r\nwhich I will briefly describe. The lower part was a glass cylinder eight\r\ninches in height and eight inches in diameter; the tube for the torsion\r\nthread was seventeen inches in length. The torsion thread itself was not of\r\nmetal, but glass, according to the excellent suggestion of the late Dr.\r\nRitchie[B]. It was twenty inches in length, and of such tenuity that when\r\nthe shell-lac lever and attached ball, &c. were connected with it, they\r\nmade about ten vibrations in a minute. It would bear torsion through four\r\nrevolutions or 1440°, and yet, when released, return accurately to its\r\nposition; probably it would have borne considerably more than this without\r\ninjury. The repelled ball was of pith, gilt, and was 0.3 of an inch in\r\ndiameter. The horizontal stem or lever supporting it was of shell-lac,\r\naccording to Coulomb's direction, the arm carrying the ball being 2.4\r\ninches long, and the other only 1.2 inches: to this was attached the vane,\r\nalso described by Coulomb, which I found to answer admirably its purpose of\r\nquickly destroying vibrations. That the inductive action within the\r\nelectrometer might be uniform in all positions of the repelled ball and in\r\nall states of the apparatus, two bands of tin foil, about an inch wide\r\neach, were attached to the inner surface of the glass cylinder, going\r\nentirely round it, at the distance of 0.4 of an inch from each other, and\r\nat such a height that the intermediate clear surface was in the same\r\nhorizontal plane with the lever and ball. These bands were connected with\r\neach other and with the earth, and, being perfect conductors, always\r\nexerted a uniform influence on the electrified balls within, which the\r\nglass surface, from its irregularity of condition at different times, I\r\nfound, did not. For the purpose of keeping the air within the electrometer\r\nin a constant state as to dryness, a glass dish, of such size as to enter\r\neasily within the cylinder, had a layer of fused potash placed within it,\r\nand this being covered with a disc of fine wire-gauze to render its\r\ninductive action uniform at all parts, was placed within the instrument at\r\nthe bottom and left there.\r\n\r\n  [A] Mémoires de l'Académie, 1785, p. 570.\r\n\r\n  [B] Philosophical Transactions, 1830.\r\n\r\n1181. The moveable ball used to take and measure the portion of electricity\r\nunder examination, and which may be called the _repelling_, or the\r\n_carrier_, ball, was of soft alder wood, well and smoothly gilt. It was\r\nattached to a fine shell-lac stem, and introduced through a hole into the\r\nelectrometer according to Coulomb's method: the stem was fixed at its upper\r\nend in a block or vice, supported on three short feet; and on the surface\r\nof the glass cover above was a plate of lead with stops on it, so that when\r\nthe carrier ball was adjusted in its right position, with the vice above\r\nbearing at the same time against these stops, it was perfectly easy to\r\nbring away the carrier-ball and restore it to its place again very\r\naccurately, without any loss of time.\r\n\r\n1182. It is quite necessary to attend to certain precautions respecting\r\nthese balls. If of pith alone they are bad; for when very dry, that\r\nsubstance is so imperfect a conductor that it neither receives nor gives a\r\ncharge freely, and so, after contact with a charged conductor, it is liable\r\nto be in an uncertain condition. Again, it is difficult to turn pith so\r\nsmooth as to leave the ball, even when gilt, so free from irregularities of\r\nform, as to retain its charge undiminished for a considerable length of\r\ntime. When, therefore, the balls are finally prepared and gilt they should\r\nbe examined; and being electrified, unless they can hold their charge with\r\nvery little diminution for a considerable time, and yet be discharged\r\ninstantly and perfectly by the touch of an uninsulated conductor, they\r\nshould be dismissed.\r\n\r\n1183. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to refer to the graduation of the\r\ninstrument, further than to explain how the observations were made. On a\r\ncircle or ring of paper on the outside of the glass cylinder, fixed so as\r\nto cover the internal lower ring of tinfoil, were marked four points\r\ncorresponding to angles of 90°; four other points exactly corresponding to\r\nthese points being marked on the upper ring of tinfoil within. By these and\r\nthe adjusting screws on which the whole instrument stands, the glass\r\ntorsion thread could be brought accurately into the centre of the\r\ninstrument and of the graduations on it. From one of the four points on the\r\nexterior of the cylinder a graduation of 90° was set off, and a\r\ncorresponding graduation was placed upon the upper tinfoil on the opposite\r\nside of the cylinder within; and a dot being marked on that point of the\r\nsurface of the repelled ball nearest to the side of the electrometer, it\r\nwas easy, by observing the line which this dot made with the lines of the\r\ntwo graduations just referred to, to ascertain accurately the position of\r\nthe ball. The upper end of the glass thread was attached, as in Coulomb's\r\noriginal electrometer, to an index, which had its appropriate graduated\r\ncircle, upon which the degree of torsion was ultimately to be read off.\r\n\r\n1184. After the levelling of the instrument and adjustment of the glass\r\nthread, the blocks which determine the place of the _carrier ball_ are to\r\nbe regulated (1181.) so that, when the carrier arrangement is placed\r\nagainst them, the centre of the ball may be in the radius of the instrument\r\ncorresponding to 0° on the lower graduation or that on the side of the\r\nelectrometer, and at the same level and distance from the centre as the\r\n_repelled ball_ on the suspended torsion lever. Then the torsion index is\r\nto be turned until the ball connected with it (the repelled ball) is\r\naccurately at 30°, and finally the graduated arc belonging to the torsion\r\nindex is to be adjusted so as to bring 0° upon it to the index. This state\r\nof the instrument was adopted as that which gave the most direct expression\r\nof the experimental results, and in the form having fewest variable errors;\r\nthe angular distance of 30° being always retained as the standard distance\r\nto which the balls were in every case to be brought, and the whole of the\r\ntorsion being read off at once on the graduated circle above. Under these\r\ncircumstances the distance of the balls from each other was not merely the\r\nsame in degree, but their position in the instrument, and in relation to\r\nevery part of it, was actually the same every time that a measurement was\r\nmade; so that all irregularities arising from slight difference of form and\r\naction in the instrument and the bodies around were avoided. The only\r\ndifference which could occur in the position of anything within, consisted\r\nin the deflexion of the torsion thread from a vertical position, more or\r\nless, according to the force of repulsion of the balls; but this was so\r\nslight as to cause no interfering difference in the symmetry of form within\r\nthe instrument, and gave no error in the amount of torsion force indicated\r\non the graduation above.\r\n\r\n1185. Although the constant angular distance of 30° between the centres of\r\nthe balls was adopted, and found abundantly sensible, for all ordinary\r\npurposes, yet the facility of rendering the instrument far more sensible by\r\ndiminishing this distance was at perfect command; the results at different\r\ndistances being very easily compared with each other either by experiment,\r\nor, as they are inversely as the squares of the distances, by calculation.\r\n\r\n1186. The Coulomb balance electrometer requires experience to be\r\nunderstood; but I think it a very valuable instrument in the hands of those\r\nwho will take pains by practice and attention to learn the precautions\r\nneedful in its use. Its insulating condition varies with circumstances, and\r\nshould be examined before it is employed in experiments. In an ordinary and\r\nfair condition, when the balls were so electrified as to give a repulsive\r\ntorsion force of 100° at the standard distance of 30°, it took nearly four\r\nhours to sink to 50° at the same distance; the average loss from 400° to\r\n300° being at the rate of 2°.7 per minute, from 300° to 200° of 1°.7 per\r\nminute, from 200° to 100° of 1°.3 per minute, and from 100° to 50° of 0°.87\r\nper minute. As a complete measurement by the instrument may be made in much\r\nless than a minute, the amount of loss in that time is but small, and can\r\neasily be taken into account.\r\n\r\n1187. _The inductive apparatus._--My object was to examine inductive action\r\ncarefully when taking place through different media, for which purpose it\r\nwas necessary to subject these media to it in exactly similar\r\ncircumstances, and in such quantities as should suffice to eliminate any\r\nvariations they might present. The requisites of the apparatus to be\r\nconstructed were, therefore, that the inducing surfaces of the conductors\r\nshould have a constant form and state, and be at a constant distance from\r\neach other; and that either solids, fluids, or gases might be placed and\r\nretained between these surfaces with readiness and certainty, and for any\r\nlength of time.\r\n\r\n1188. The apparatus used may be described in general terms as consisting of\r\ntwo metallic spheres of unequal diameter, placed, the smaller within the\r\nlarger, and concentric with it; the interval between the two being the\r\nspace through which the induction was to take place. A section of it is\r\ngiven (Plate VII. fig. 104.) on a scale of one-half: _a, a_ are the two\r\nhalves of a brass sphere, with an air-tight joint at _b_, like that of the\r\nMagdeburg hemispheres, made perfectly flush and smooth inside so as to\r\npresent no irregularity; _c_ is a connecting piece by which the apparatus\r\nis joined to a good stop-cock _d_, which is itself attached either to the\r\nmetallic foot _e_, or to an air-pump. The aperture within the hemisphere at\r\n_f_ is very small: _g_ is a brass collar fitted to the upper hemisphere,\r\nthrough which the shell-lac support of the inner ball and its stem passes;\r\n_h_ is the inner ball, also of brass; it screws on to a brass stem _i_,\r\nterminated above by a brass ball B, _l, l_ is a mass of shell-lac, moulded\r\ncarefully on to _i_, and serving both to support and insulate it and its\r\nballs _h_, B. The shell-lac stem _l_ is fitted into the socket _g_, by a\r\nlittle ordinary resinous cement, more fusible than shell-lac, applied at\r\n_mm_ in such a way as to give sufficient strength and render the apparatus\r\nair-tight there, yet leave as much as possible of the lower part of the\r\nshell-lac stem untouched, as an insulation between the ball _h_ and the\r\nsurrounding sphere _a, a_. The ball _h_ has a small aperture at _n_, so\r\nthat when the apparatus is exhausted of one gas and filled with another,\r\nthe ball _h_ may itself also be exhausted and filled, that no variation of\r\nthe gas in the interval _o_ may occur during the course of an experiment.\r\n\r\n1189. It will be unnecessary to give the dimensions of all the parts, since\r\nthe drawing is to a scale of one-half: the inner ball has a diameter 2.33\r\ninches, and the surrounding sphere an internal diameter of 3.57 inches.\r\nHence the width of the intervening space, through which the induction is to\r\ntake place, is 0.62 of an inch; and the extent of this place or plate, i.e.\r\nthe surface of a medium sphere, may be taken as twenty-seven square inches,\r\na quantity considered as sufficiently large for the comparison of different\r\nsubstances. Great care was taken in finishing well the inducing surfaces of\r\nthe ball _h_ and sphere _a, a_; and no varnish or lacquer was applied to\r\nthem, or to any part of the metal of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n1190. The attachment and adjustment of the shell-lac stem was a matter\r\nrequiring considerable care, especially as, in consequence of its cracking,\r\nit had frequently to be renewed. The best lac was chosen and applied to the\r\nwire _i_, so as to be in good contact with it everywhere, and in perfect\r\ncontinuity throughout its own mass. It was not smaller than is given by\r\nscale in the drawing, for when less it frequently cracked within a few\r\nhours after it was cold. I think that very slow cooling or annealing\r\nimproved its quality in this respect. The collar _g_ was made as thin as\r\ncould be, that the lac might be as wide there as possible. In order that at\r\nevery re-attachment of the stem to the upper hemisphere the ball _h_ might\r\nhave the same relative position, a gauge _p_ (fig. 105.) was made of wood,\r\nand this being applied to the ball and hemisphere whilst the cement at _m_\r\nwas still soft, the bearings of the ball at _qq_, and the hemisphere at\r\n_rr_, were forced home, and the whole left until cold. Thus all difficulty\r\nin the adjustment of the ball in the sphere was avoided.\r\n\r\n1191. I had occasion at first to attach the stem to the socket by other\r\nmeans, as a band of paper or a plugging of white silk thread; but these\r\nwere very inferior to the cement, interfering much with the insulating\r\npower of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n1192. The retentive power of this apparatus was, when in good condition,\r\nbetter than that of the electrometer (1186.), i.e. the proportion of loss\r\nof power was less. Thus when the apparatus was electrified, and also the\r\nballs in the electrometer, to such a degree, that after the inner ball had\r\nbeen in contact with the top _k_ of the ball of the apparatus, it caused a\r\nrepulsion indicated by 600° of torsion force, then in falling from 600° to\r\n400° the average loss was 8°.6 per minute; from 400° to 300° the average\r\nloss was 2°.6 per minute; from 300° to 200° it was 1°.7 per minute; from\r\n200° to 170° it was 1° per minute. This was after the apparatus had been\r\ncharged for a short time; at the first instant of charging there is an\r\napparent loss of electricity, which can only be comprehended hereafter\r\n(1207. 1250.).\r\n\r\n1193. When the apparatus loses its insulating power suddenly, it is almost\r\nalways from a crack near to or within the brass socket. These cracks are\r\nusually transverse to the stem. If they occur at the part attached by\r\ncommon cement to the socket, the air cannot enter, and thus constituting\r\nvacua, they conduct away the electricity and lower the charge, as fast\r\nalmost as if a piece of metal had been introduced there. Occasionally stems\r\nin this state, being taken out and cleared from the common cement, may, by\r\nthe careful application of the heat of a spirit-lamp, be so far softened\r\nand melted as to restore the perfect continuity of the parts; but if that\r\ndoes not succeed in replacing things in a good condition, the remedy is a\r\nnew shell-lac stem.\r\n\r\n1194. The apparatus when in order could easily be exhausted of air and\r\nfilled with any given gas; but when that gas was acid or alkaline, it could\r\nnot properly be removed by the air-pump, and yet required to be perfectly\r\ncleared away. In such cases the apparatus was opened and emptied of gas;\r\nand with respect to the inner ball _h_, it was washed out two or three\r\ntimes with distilled water introduced at the screw-hole, and then being\r\nheated above 212°, air was blown through to render the interior perfectly\r\ndry.\r\n\r\n1195. The inductive apparatus described is evidently a Leyden phial, with\r\nthe advantage, however, of having the _dielectric_ or insulating medium\r\nchanged at pleasure. The balls _h_ and B, with the connecting wire _i_,\r\nconstitute the charged conductor, upon the surface of which all the\r\nelectric force is resident by virtue of induction (1178.). Now though the\r\nlargest portion of this induction is between the ball _h_ and the\r\nsurrounding sphere _aa_, yet the wire _i_ and the ball B determine a part\r\nof the induction from their surfaces towards the external surrounding\r\nconductors. Still, as all things in that respect remain the same, whilst\r\nthe medium within at _oo_, may be varied, any changes exhibited by the\r\nwhole apparatus will in such cases depend upon the variations made in the\r\ninterior; and these were the changes I was in search of, the negation or\r\nestablishment of such differences being the great object of my inquiry. I\r\nconsidered that these differences, if they existed, would be most\r\ndistinctly set forth by having two apparatus of the kind described,\r\nprecisely similar in every respect; and then, _different insulating media_\r\nbeing within, to charge one and measure it, and after dividing the charge\r\nwith the other, to observe what the ultimate conditions of both were. If\r\ninsulating media really had any specific differences in favouring or\r\nopposing inductive action through them, such differences, I conceived,\r\ncould not fail of being developed by such a process.\r\n\r\n1196. I will wind up this description of the apparatus, and explain the\r\nprecautions necessary to their use, by describing the form and order of the\r\nexperiments made to prove their equality when both contained common air. In\r\norder to facilitate reference I will distinguish the two by the terms App.\r\ni. and App. ii.\r\n\r\n1197. The electrometer is first to be adjusted and examined (1184.), and\r\nthe app. i. and ii. are to be perfectly discharged. A Leyden phial is to be\r\ncharged to such a degree that it would give a spark of about one-sixteenth\r\nor one-twentieth of an inch in length between two balls of half an inch\r\ndiameter; and the carrier ball of the electrometer being charged by this\r\nphial, is to be introduced into the electrometer, and the lever ball\r\nbrought by the motion of the torsion index against it; the charge is thus\r\ndivided between the balls, and repulsion ensues. It is useful then to bring\r\nthe repelled ball to the standard distance of 30° by the motion of the\r\ntorsion index, and observe the force in degrees required for this purpose;\r\nthis force will in future experiments be called _repulsion of the balls_.\r\n\r\n1198. One of the inductive apparatus, as, for instance, app. i., is now to\r\nbe charged from the Leyden phial, the latter being in the state it was in\r\nwhen used to charge the balls; the carrier ball is to be brought into\r\ncontact with the top of its upper ball (_k_, fig. 104.), then introduced\r\ninto the electrometer, and the repulsive force (at the distance of 30°)\r\nmeasured. Again, the carrier should be applied to the app. i. and the\r\nmeasurement repeated; the apparatus i. and ii. are then to be joined, so as\r\nto _divide_ the charge, and afterwards the force of each measured by the\r\ncarrier ball, applied as before, and the results carefully noted. After\r\nthis both i. and ii. are to be discharged; then app. ii. charged, measured,\r\ndivided with app. i., and the force of each again measured and noted. If in\r\neach case the half charges of app. i. and ii. are equal, and are together\r\nequal to the whole charge before division, then it may be considered as\r\nproved that the two apparatus are precisely equal in power, and fit to be\r\nused in cases of comparison between different insulating media or\r\n_dielectrics_.\r\n\r\n1199. But the _precautions_ necessary to obtain accurate results are\r\nnumerous. The apparatus i. and ii. must always be placed on a thoroughly\r\nuninsulating medium. A mahogany table, for instance, is far from\r\nsatisfactory in this respect, and therefore a sheet of tinfoil, connected\r\nwith an extensive discharging train (292.), is what I have used. They must\r\nbe so placed also as not to be too near each other, and yet equally exposed\r\nto the inductive influence of surrounding objects; and these objects,\r\nagain, should not be disturbed in their position during an experiment, or\r\nelse variations of induction upon the external ball B of the apparatus may\r\noccur, and so errors be introduced into the results. The carrier ball, when\r\nreceiving its portion of electricity from the apparatus, should always be\r\napplied at the same part of the ball, as, for instance, the summit _k_, and\r\nalways in the same way; variable induction from the vicinity of the head,\r\nhands, &c. being avoided, and the ball after contact being withdrawn\r\nupwards in a regular and constant manner.\r\n\r\n1200. As the stem had occasionally to be changed (1190.), and the change\r\nmight occasion slight variations in the position of the ball within, I made\r\nsuch a variation purposely, to the amount of an eighth of an inch (which is\r\nfar more than ever could occur in practice), but did not find that it\r\nsensibly altered the relation of the apparatus, or its inductive condition\r\n_as a whole_. Another trial of the apparatus was made as to the effect of\r\ndampness in the air, one being filled with very dry air, and the other with\r\nair from over water. Though this produced no change in the result, except\r\nan occasional tendency to more rapid dissipation, yet the precaution was\r\nalways taken when working with gases (1290.) to dry them perfectly.\r\n\r\n1201. It is essential that the interior of the apparatus should be\r\nperfectly free from _dust or small loose particles_, for these very rapidly\r\nlower the charge and interfere on occasions when their presence and action\r\nwould hardly be expected. To breathe on the interior of the apparatus and\r\nwipe it out quietly with a clean silk handkerchief, is an effectual way of\r\nremoving them; but then the intrusion of other particles should be\r\ncarefully guarded against, and a dusty atmosphere should for this and\r\nseveral other reasons be avoided.\r\n\r\n1202. The shell-lac stem requires occasionally to be well-wiped, to remove,\r\nin the first instance, the film of wax and adhering matter which is upon\r\nit; and afterwards to displace dirt and dust which will gradually attach to\r\nit in the course of experiments. I have found much to depend upon this\r\nprecaution, and a silk handkerchief is the best wiper.\r\n\r\n1203. But wiping and some other circumstances tend to give a charge to the\r\nsurface of the shell-lac stem. This should be removed, for, if allowed to\r\nremain, it very seriously affects the degree of charge given to the carrier\r\nball by the apparatus (1232.). This condition of the stem is best observed\r\nby discharging the apparatus, applying the carrier ball to the stem,\r\ntouching it with the finger, insulating and removing it, and examining\r\nwhether it has received any charge (by induction) from the stem; if it has,\r\nthe stem itself is in a charged state. The best method of removing the\r\ncharge I have found to be, to cover the finger with a single fold of a silk\r\nhandkerchief, and breathing on the stem, to wipe it immediately after with\r\nthe finger; the ball B and its connected wire, &c. being at the same time\r\n_uninsulated_: the wiping place of the silk must not be changed; it then\r\nbecomes sufficiently damp not to excite the stem, and is yet dry enough to\r\nleave it in a clean and excellent insulating condition. If the air be\r\ndusty, it will be found that a single charge of the apparatus will bring on\r\nan electric state of the outside of the stem, in consequence of the\r\ncarrying power of the particles of dust; whereas in the morning, and in a\r\nroom which has been left quiet, several experiments can be made in\r\nsuccession without the stem assuming the least degree of charge.\r\n\r\n1204. Experiments should not be made by candle or lamp light except with\r\nmuch care, for flames have great and yet unsteady powers of affecting and\r\ndissipating electrical charges.\r\n\r\n1205. As a final observation on the state of the apparatus, they should\r\nretain their charges well and uniformly, and alike for both, and at the\r\nsame time allow of a perfect and instantaneous discharge, giving afterwards\r\nno charge to the carrier ball, whatever part of the ball B it may be\r\napplied to (1218.).\r\n\r\n1206. With respect to the balance electrometer, all the precautions that\r\nneed be mentioned, are, that the carrier ball is to be preserved during the\r\nfirst part of an experiment in its electrified state, the loss of\r\nelectricity which would follow upon its discharge being avoided; and that\r\nin introducing it into the electrometer through the hole in the glass plate\r\nabove, care should be taken that it do not touch, or even come near to, the\r\nedge of the glass.\r\n\r\n1207. When the whole charge in one apparatus is divided between the two,\r\nthe gradual fall, apparently from dissipation, in the apparatus which has\r\n_received_ the half charge is greater than in the one _originally_ charged.\r\nThis is due to a peculiar effect to be described hereafter (1250. 1251.),\r\nthe interfering influence of which may be avoided to a great extent by\r\ngoing through the steps of the process regularly and quickly; therefore,\r\nafter the original charge has been measured, in app. i. for instance, i.\r\nand ii. are to be symmetrically joined by their balls B, the carrier\r\ntouching one of these balls at the same time; it is first to be removed,\r\nand then the apparatus separated from each other; app. ii. is next quickly\r\nto be measured by the carrier, then app. i.; lastly, ii. is to be\r\ndischarged, and the discharged carrier applied to it to ascertain whether\r\nany residual effect is present (1205.), and app. i. being discharged is\r\nalso to be examined in the same manner and for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n1208. The following is an example of the division of a charge by the two\r\napparatus, air being the dielectric in both of them. The observations are\r\nset down one under the other in the order in which they were taken, the\r\nleft-hand numbers representing the observations made on app. i., and the\r\nright-hand numbers those on app. ii. App. i. is that which was originally\r\ncharged, and after two measurements, the charge was divided with app. ii.\r\n\r\nApp. i.    App. ii.\r\n     Balls 160°\r\n\r\n      . . . .   0°\r\n254°  . . . .\r\n250   . . . .\r\ndivided and instantly taken\r\n      . . . . 122\r\n124   . . . .\r\n  1   . . . .     after being discharged.\r\n      . . . .   2 after being discharged.\r\n\r\n1209. Without endeavouring to allow for the loss which must have been\r\ngradually going on during the time of the experiment, let us observe the\r\nresults of the numbers as they stand. As 1° remained in app. i. in an\r\nundischargeable state, 249° may be taken as the utmost amount of the\r\ntransferable or divisible charge, the half of which is 124°.5. As app. ii.\r\nwas free of charge in the first instance, and immediately after the\r\ndivision was found with 122°, this amount _at least_ may be taken as what\r\nit had received. On the other hand 124° minus 1°, or 123°, may be taken as\r\nthe half of the transferable charge retained by app. i. Now these do not\r\ndiffer much from each other, or from 124°.5, the half of the full amount of\r\ntransferable charge; and when the gradual loss of charge evident in the\r\ndifference between 254° and 250° of app. i. is also taken into account,\r\nthere is every reason to admit the result as showing an equal division of\r\ncharge, _unattended by any disappearance of power_ except that due to\r\ndissipation.\r\n\r\n1210. I will give another result, in which app. ii. was first charged, and\r\nwhere the residual action of that apparatus was greater than in the former\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nApp. i.    App. ii.\r\n     Balls 150°\r\n\r\n      . . . . 152°\r\n      . . . . 148\r\ndivided and instantly taken\r\n  70° . . . .\r\n      . . . .  78\r\n      . . . .   5 immediately after discharge.\r\n   0  . . . .     immediately after discharge.\r\n\r\n1211. The transferable charge being 148° - 5°, its half is 71°.5, which is\r\nnot far removed from 70°, the half charge of i.; or from 73°, the half\r\ncharge of ii.: these half charges again making up the sum of 143°, or just\r\nthe amount of the whole transferable charge. Considering the errors of\r\nexperiment, therefore, these results may again be received as showing that\r\nthe apparatus were equal in inductive capacity, or in their powers of\r\nreceiving charges.\r\n\r\n1212. The experiments were repeated with charges of negative electricity\r\nwith the same general results.\r\n\r\n1213. That I might be sure of the sensibility and action of the apparatus,\r\nI made such a change in one as ought upon principle to increase its\r\ninductive force, i.e. I put a metallic lining into the lower hemisphere of\r\napp. i., so as to diminish the thickness of the intervening air in that\r\npart, from 0.62 to 0.435 of an inch: this lining was carefully shaped and\r\nrounded so that it should not present a sudden projection within at its\r\nedge, but a gradual transition from the reduced interval in the lower part\r\nof the sphere to the larger one in the upper.\r\n\r\n1214. This change immediately caused app. i. to produce effects indicating\r\nthat it had a greater aptness or capacity for induction than app. ii. Thus,\r\nwhen a transferable charge in app. ii. of 469° was divided with app. i.,\r\nthe former retained a charge of 225°, whilst the latter showed one of 227°,\r\ni.e. the former had lost 244° in communicating 227° to the latter: on the\r\nother hand, when app. i. had a transferable charge in it of 381° divided by\r\ncontact with app. ii., it lost 181° only, whilst it gave to app. ii. as\r\nmany as 194:--the sum of the divided forces being in the first instance\r\n_less_, and in the second instance _greater_ than the original undivided\r\ncharge. These results are the more striking, as only one-half of the\r\ninterior of app. i. was modified, and they show that the instruments are\r\ncapable of bringing out differences in inductive force from amongst the\r\nerrors of experiment, when these differences are much less than that\r\nproduced by the alteration made in the present instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ iv. _Induction in curved lines._\r\n\r\n1215. Amongst those results deduced from the molecular view of induction\r\n(1166.), which, being of a peculiar nature, are the best tests of the truth\r\nor error of the theory, the expected action in curved lines is, I think,\r\nthe most important at present; for, if shown to take place in an\r\nunexceptionable manner, I do not see how the old theory of action at a\r\ndistance and in straight lines can stand, or how the conclusion that\r\nordinary induction is an action of contiguous particles can be resisted.\r\n\r\n1216. There are many forms of old experiments which might be quoted as\r\nfavourable to, and consistent with the view I have adopted. Such are most\r\ncases of electro-chemical decomposition, electrical brushes, auras, sparks,\r\n&c.; but as these might be considered equivocal evidence, inasmuch as they\r\ninclude a current and discharge, (though they have long been to me\r\nindications of prior molecular action (1230.)) I endeavoured to devise such\r\nexperiments for first proofs as should not include transfer, but relate\r\naltogether to the pure simple inductive action of statical electricity.\r\n\r\n1217. It was also of importance to make these experiments in the simplest\r\npossible manner, using not more than one insulating medium or dielectric at\r\na time, lest differences of slow conduction should produce effects which\r\nmight erroneously be supposed to result from induction in curved lines. It\r\nwill be unnecessary to describe the steps of the investigation minutely; I\r\nwill at once proceed to the simplest mode of proving the facts, first in\r\nair and then in other insulating media.\r\n\r\n1218. A cylinder of solid shell-lac, 0.9 of an inch in diameter and seven\r\ninches in length, was fixed upright in a wooden foot (fig. 106.): it was\r\nmade concave or cupped at its upper extremity so that a brass ball or other\r\nsmall arrangement could stand upon it. The upper half of the stem having\r\nbeen excited _negatively_ by friction with warm flannel, a brass ball, B, 1\r\ninch in diameter, was placed on the top, and then the whole arrangement\r\nexamined by the carrier ball and Coulomb's electrometer (1180. &c.). For\r\nthis purpose the balls of the electrometer were charged _positively_ to\r\nabout 360°, and then the carrier being applied to various parts of the ball\r\nB, the two were uninsulated whilst in contact or in position, then\r\ninsulated[A], separated, and the charge of the carrier examined as to its\r\nnature and force. Its electricity was always positive, and its force at the\r\ndifferent positions _a, b, c, d,_ &c. (figs. 106. and 107.) observed in\r\nsuccession, was as follows:\r\n\r\nat _a_        above 1000°\r\n   _b_ it was        149\r\n   _c_               270\r\n   _d_               512\r\n   _b_               130\r\n\r\n  [A] It can hardly be necessary for me to say here, that whatever\r\n  general state the carrier ball acquired in any place where it was\r\n  uninsulated and then insulated, it retained on removal from that\r\n  place, notwithstanding that it might pass through other places that\r\n  would have given to it, if uninsulated, a different condition.\r\n\r\n1219. To comprehend the full force of these results, it must first be\r\nunderstood, that all the charges of the ball B and the carrier are charges\r\nby induction, from the action of the excited surface of the shell-lac\r\ncylinder; for whatever electricity the ball B received by _communication_\r\nfrom the shell-lac, either in the first instance or afterwards, was removed\r\nby the uninsulating contacts, only that due to induction remaining; and\r\nthis is shown by the charges taken from the ball in this its uninsulated\r\nstate being always positive, or of the contrary character to the\r\nelectricity of the shell-lac. In the next place, the charges at _a_, _c_,\r\nand _d_ were of such a nature as might be expected from an inductive action\r\nin straight lines, but that obtained at _b_ is _not so_: it is clearly a\r\ncharge by induction, but _induction_ in _a curved line_; for the carrier\r\nball whilst applied to _b_, and after its removal to a distance of six\r\ninches or more from B, could not, in consequence of the size of B, be\r\nconnected by a straight line with any part of the excited and inducing\r\nshell-lac.\r\n\r\n1220. To suppose that the upper part of the _uninsulated_ ball B, should in\r\nsome way be retained in an electrified state by that portion of the surface\r\nof the ball which is in sight of the shell-lac, would be in opposition to\r\nwhat we know already of the subject. Electricity is retained upon the\r\nsurface of conductors only by induction (1178.); and though some persons\r\nmay not be prepared as yet to admit this with respect to insulated\r\nconductors, all will as regards uninsulated conductors like the ball B; and\r\nto decide the matter we have only to place the carrier ball at _e_ (fig.\r\n107.), so that it shall not come in contact with B, uninsulate it by a\r\nmetallic rod descending perpendicularly, insulate it, remove it, and\r\nexamine its state; it will be found charged with the same kind of\r\nelectricity as, and even to a _higher degree_ (1224.) than, if it had been\r\nin contact with the summit of B.\r\n\r\n1221. To suppose, again, that induction acts in some way _through or\r\nacross_ the metal of the ball, is negatived by the simplest considerations;\r\nbut a fact in proof will be better. If instead of the ball B a small disc\r\nof metal be used, the carrier may be charged at, or above the middle of its\r\nupper surface: but if the plate be enlarged to about 1-1/2 or 2 inches in\r\ndiameter, C (fig. 108.), then no charge will be given to the carrier at\r\n_f_, though when applied nearer to the edge at _g_, or even _above the\r\nmiddle_ at _h_, a charge will be obtained; and this is true though the\r\nplate may be a mere thin film of gold-leaf. Hence it is clear that the\r\ninduction is not _through_ the metal, but through the surrounding air or\r\n_dielectric_, and that in curved lines.\r\n\r\n1222. I had another arrangement, in which a wire passing downwards through\r\nthe middle of the shell-lac cylinder to the earth, was connected with the\r\nball B (fig. 109.) so as to keep it in a constantly uninsulated state. This\r\nwas a very convenient form of apparatus, and the results with it were the\r\nsame as those just described.\r\n\r\n1223. In another case the ball B was supported by a shell-lac stem,\r\nindependently of the excited cylinder of shell-lac, and at half an inch\r\ndistance from it; but the effects were the same. Then the brass ball of a\r\ncharged Leyden jar was used in place of the excited shell-lac to produce\r\ninduction; but this caused no alteration of the phenomena. Both positive\r\nand negative inducing charges were tried with the same general results.\r\nFinally, the arrangement was inverted in the air for the purpose of\r\nremoving every possible objection to the conclusions, but they came out\r\nexactly the same.\r\n\r\n1224. Some results obtained with a brass hemisphere instead of the ball B\r\nwere exceedingly interesting, It was 1.36 of an inch in diameter, (fig.\r\n110.), and being placed on the top of the excited shell-lac cylinder, the\r\ncarrier ball was applied, as in the former experiments (1218.), at the\r\nrespective positions delineated in the figure. At _i_ the force was 112°,\r\nat _k_ 108°, at _l_ 65°, at _m_ 35°; the inductive force gradually\r\ndiminishing, as might have been expected, to this point. But on raising the\r\ncarrier to the position _n_, the charge increased to 87°; and on raising it\r\nstill higher to _o_, the charge still further increased to 105°: at a\r\nhigher point still, _p_, the charge taken was smaller in amount, being 98°,\r\nand continued to diminish for more elevated positions. Here the induction\r\nfairly turned a corner. Nothing, in fact, can better show both the curved\r\nlines or courses of the inductive action, disturbed as they are from their\r\nrectilineal form by the shape, position, and condition of the metallic\r\nhemisphere; and also a _lateral tension,_ so to speak, of these lines on\r\none another:--all depending, as I conceive, on induction being an action of\r\nthe contiguous particles of the dielectric, which being thrown into a state\r\nof polarity and tension, are in mutual relation by their forces in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n1225. As another proof that the whole of these actions were inductive I may\r\nstate a result which was exactly what might be expected, namely, that if\r\nuninsulated conducting matter was brought round and near to the excited\r\nshell-lac stem, then the inductive force was directed towards it, and could\r\nnot be found on the top of the hemisphere. Removing this matter the lines\r\nof force resumed their former direction. The experiment affords proofs of\r\nthe lateral tension of these lines, and supplies a warning to remove such\r\nmatter in repeating the above investigation.\r\n\r\n1226. After these results on curved inductive action in air I extended the\r\nexperiments to other gases, using first carbonic acid and then hydrogen:\r\nthe phenomena were precisely those already described. In these experiments\r\nI found that if the gases were confined in vessels they required to be very\r\nlarge, for whether of glass or earthenware, the conducting power of such\r\nmaterials is so great that the induction of the excited shell-lac cylinder\r\ntowards them is as much as if they were metal; and if the vessels be small,\r\nso great a portion of the inductive force is determined towards them that\r\nthe lateral tension or mutual repulsion of the lines of force before spoken\r\nof, (1224.) by which their inflexion is caused, is so much relieved in\r\nother directions, that no inductive charge will be given to the carrier\r\nball in the positions _k, l, m, n, o, p_ (fig. 110.). A very good mode of\r\nmaking the experiment is to let large currents of the gases ascend or\r\ndescend through the air, and carry on the experiments in these currents.\r\n\r\n1227. These experiments were then varied by the substitution of a liquid\r\ndielectric, namely, _oil of turpentine_, in place of air and gases. A dish\r\nof thin glass well-covered with a film of shell-lac (1272.), which was\r\nfound by trial to insulate well, had some highly rectified oil of\r\nturpentine put into it to the depth of half an inch, and being then placed\r\nupon the top of the brass hemisphere (fig. 110.), observations were made\r\nwith the carrier ball as before (1224.). The results were the same, and the\r\ncircumstance of some of the positions being within the fluid and some\r\nwithout, made no sensible difference.\r\n\r\n1228. Lastly, I used a few solid dielectrics for the same purpose, and with\r\nthe same results. These were shell-lac, sulphur, fused and cast borate of\r\nlead, flint glass well-covered with a film of lac, and spermaceti. The\r\nfollowing was the form of experiment with sulphur, and all were of the same\r\nkind. A square plate of the substance, two inches in extent and 0.6 of an\r\ninch in thickness, was cast with a small hole or depression in the middle\r\nof one surface to receive the carrier ball. This was placed upon the\r\nsurface of the metal hemisphere (fig. 112.) arranged on the excited lac as\r\nin former cases, and observations were made at _n, o, p_, and _q_. Great\r\ncare was required in these experiments to free the sulphur or other solid\r\nsubstance from any charge it might previously have received. This was done\r\nby breathing and wiping (1203.), and the substance being found free from\r\nall electrical excitement, was then used in the experiment; after which it\r\nwas removed and again examined, to ascertain that it had received no\r\ncharge, but had acted really as a dielectric. With all these precautions\r\nthe results were the same: and it is thus very satisfactory to obtain the\r\ncurved inductive action through _solid bodies_, as any possible effect from\r\nthe translation of charged particles in fluids or gases, which some persons\r\nmight imagine to be the case, is here entirely negatived.\r\n\r\n1229. In these experiments with solid dielectrics, the degree of charge\r\nassumed by the carrier ball at the situations _n, o, p_ (fig. 112.), was\r\ndecidedly greater than that given to the ball at the same places when air\r\nonly intervened between it and the metal hemisphere. This effect is\r\nconsistent with what will hereafter be found to be the respective relations\r\nof these bodies, as to their power of facilitating induction through them\r\n(1269. 1273. 1277.).\r\n\r\n1230. I might quote _many_ other forms of experiment, some old and some\r\nnew, in which induction in curved or contorted lines takes place, but think\r\nit unnecessary after the preceding results; I shall therefore mention but\r\ntwo. If a conductor A, (fig. 111.) be electrified, and an uninsulated\r\nmetallic ball B, or even a plate, provided the edges be not too thin, be\r\nheld before it, a small electrometer at _c_ or at _d_, uninsulated, will\r\ngive signs of electricity, opposite in its nature to that of A, and\r\ntherefore caused by induction, although the influencing and influenced\r\nbodies cannot be joined by a right line passing through the air. Or if, the\r\nelectrometers being removed, a point be fixed at the back of the ball in\r\nits uninsulated state as at C, this point will become luminous and\r\ndischarge the conductor A. The latter experiment is described by\r\nNicholson[A], who, however, reasons erroneously upon it. As to its\r\nintroduction here, though it is a case of discharge, the discharge is\r\npreceded by induction, and that induction must be in curved lines.\r\n\r\n  [A] Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. vi. p. 504.\r\n\r\n1231. As argument against the received theory of induction and in favour of\r\nthat which I have ventured to put forth, I cannot see how the preceding\r\nresults can be avoided. The effects are clearly inductive effects produced\r\nby electricity, not in currents but in its statical state, and this\r\ninduction is exerted in lines of force which, though in many experiments\r\nthey may be straight, are here curved more or less according to\r\ncircumstances. I use the term _line of inductive force_ merely as a\r\ntemporary conventional mode of expressing the direction of the power in\r\ncases of induction; and in the experiments with the hemisphere (1224.), it\r\nis curious to see how, when certain lines have terminated on the under\r\nsurface and edge of the metal, those which were before lateral to them\r\n_expand and open out from each other_, some bending round and terminating\r\ntheir action on the upper surface of the hemisphere, and others meeting, as\r\nit were, above in their progress outwards, uniting their forces to give an\r\nincreased charge to the carrier ball, at an _increased distance_ from the\r\nsource of power, and influencing each other so as to cause a second flexure\r\nin the contrary direction from the first one. All this appears to me to\r\nprove that the whole action is one of contiguous particles, related to each\r\nother, not merely in the lines which they may be conceived to form through\r\nthe dielectric, between the _inductric_ and the _inducteous_ surfaces\r\n(1483.), but in other lateral directions also. It is this which gives an\r\neffect equivalent to a lateral repulsion or expansion in the lines of force\r\nI have spoken of, and enables induction to turn a corner (1304.). The\r\npower, instead of being like that of gravity, which causes particles to act\r\non each other through straight lines, whatever other particles may be\r\nbetween them, is more analogous to that of a series of magnetic needles, or\r\nto the condition of the particles considered as forming the whole of a\r\nstraight or a curved magnet. So that in whatever way I view it, and with\r\ngreat suspicion of the influence of favourite notions over myself, I cannot\r\nperceive how the ordinary theory applied to explain induction can be a\r\ncorrect representation of that great natural principle of electrical\r\naction.\r\n\r\n1232. I have had occasion in describing the precautions necessary in the\r\nuse of the inductive apparatus, to refer to one founded on induction in\r\ncurved lines (1203.); and after the experiments already described, it will\r\neasily be seen how great an influence the shell-lac stem may exert upon the\r\ncharge of the carrier ball when applied to the apparatus (1218.), unless\r\nthat precaution be attended to.\r\n\r\n1233. I think it expedient, next in the course of these experimental\r\nresearches, to describe some effects due to _conduction_, obtained with\r\nsuch bodies as glass, lac, sulphur, &c., which had not been anticipated.\r\nBeing understood, they will make us acquainted with certain precautions\r\nnecessary in investigating the great question of specific inductive\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n1234. One of the inductive apparatus already described (1187, &c.) had a\r\nhemispherical cup of shell-lac introduced, which being in the interval\r\nbetween the inner bull and the lower hemisphere, nearly occupied the space\r\nthere; consequently when the apparatus was charged, the lac was the\r\ndielectric or insulating medium through which the induction took place in\r\nthat part. When this apparatus was first charged with electricity (1198.)\r\nup to a certain intensity, as 400°, measured by the COULOMB'S electrometer\r\n(1180.), it sank much faster from that degree than if it had been\r\npreviously charged to a higher point, and had gradually fallen to 400°; or\r\nthan it would do if the charge were, by a second application, raised up\r\nagain to 400°; all other things remaining the same. Again, if after having\r\nbeen charged for some time, as fifteen or twenty minutes, it was suddenly\r\nand perfectly discharged, even the stem having all electricity removed from\r\nit (1203.), then the apparatus being left to itself, would gradually\r\nrecover a charge, which in nine or ten minutes would rise up to 50° or 60°,\r\nand in one instance to 80°.\r\n\r\n1235. The electricity, which in these cases returned from an apparently\r\nlatent to a sensible state, was always of the same kind as that which had\r\nbeen given by the charge. The return took place at both the inducing\r\nsurfaces; for if after the perfect discharge of the apparatus the whole was\r\ninsulated, as the inner ball resumed a positive state the outer sphere\r\nacquired a negative condition.\r\n\r\n1236. This effect was at once distinguished from that produced by the\r\nexcited stem acting in curved lines of induction (1203. 1232.), by the\r\ncircumstance that all the returned electricity could be perfectly and\r\ninstantly discharged. It appeared to depend upon the shell-lac within, and\r\nto be, in some way, due to electricity evolved from it in consequence of a\r\nprevious condition into which it had been brought by the charge of the\r\nmetallic coatings or balls.\r\n\r\n1237. To examine this state more accurately, the apparatus, with the\r\nhemispherical cup of shell-lac in it, was charged for about forty-five\r\nminutes to above 600° with positive electricity at the balls _h_ and B.\r\n(fig. 104.) above and within. It was then discharged, opened, the shell-lac\r\ntaken out, and its state examined; this was done by bringing the carrier\r\nball near the shell-lac, uninsulating it, insulating it, and then observing\r\nwhat charge it had acquired. As it would be a charge by induction, the\r\nstate of the ball would indicate the opposite state of electricity in that\r\nsurface of the shell-lac which had produced it. At first the lac appeared\r\nquite free from any charge; but gradually its two surfaces assumed opposite\r\nstates of electricity, the concave surface, which had been next the inner\r\nand positive ball; assuming a positive state, and the convex surface, which\r\nhad been in contact with the negative coating, acquiring a negative state;\r\nthese states gradually increased in intensity for some time.\r\n\r\n1238. As the return action was evidently greatest instantly after the\r\ndischarge, I again put the apparatus together, and charged it for fifteen\r\nminutes as before, the inner ball positively. I then discharged it,\r\ninstantly removing the upper hemisphere with the interior ball, and,\r\nleaving the shell-lac cup in the lower uninsulated hemisphere, examined its\r\ninner surface by the carrier ball as before (1237.). In this way I found\r\nthe surface of the shell-lac actually _negative_, or in the reverse state\r\nto the ball which had been in it; this state quickly disappeared, and was\r\nsucceeded by a positive condition, gradually increasing in intensity for\r\nsome time, in the same manner as before. The first negative condition of\r\nthe surface opposite the positive charging ball is a natural consequence of\r\nthe state of things, the charging ball being in contact with the shell-lac\r\nonly in a few points. It does not interfere with the general result and\r\npeculiar state now under consideration, except that it assists in\r\nillustrating in a very marked manner the ultimate assumption by the\r\nsurfaces of the shell-lac of an electrified condition, similar to that of\r\nthe metallic surfaces opposed to or against them.\r\n\r\n1239. _Glass_ was then examined with respect to its power of assuming this\r\npeculiar state. I had a thick flint-glass hemispherical cup formed, which\r\nwould fit easily into the space _o_ of the lower hemisphere (1188. 1189.);\r\nit had been heated and varnished with a solution of shell-lac in alcohol,\r\nfor the purpose of destroying the conducting power of the vitreous surface\r\n(1254.). Being then well-warmed and experimented with, I found it could\r\nalso assume the _same state_, but not apparently to the same degree, the\r\nreturn action amounting in different cases to quantities from 6° to 18°.\r\n\r\n1240. _Spermaceti_ experimented with in the same manner gave striking\r\nresults. When the original charge had been sustained for fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes at about 500°, the return charge was equal to 95° or 100°, and was\r\nabout fourteen minutes arriving at the maximum effect. A charge continued\r\nfor not more than two or three seconds was here succeeded by a return\r\ncharge of 50° or 60°. The observations formerly made (1234.) held good with\r\nthis substance. Spermaceti, though it will insulate a low charge for some\r\ntime, is a better conductor than shell-lac, glass, and sulphur; and this\r\nconducting power is connected with the readiness with which it exhibits the\r\nparticular effect under consideration.\r\n\r\n1241. _Sulphur._--I was anxious to obtain the amount of effect with this\r\nsubstance, first, because it is an excellent insulator, and in that respect\r\nwould illustrate the relation of the effect to the degree of conducting\r\npower possessed by the dielectric (1247.); and in the next place, that I\r\nmight obtain that body giving the smallest degree of the effect now under\r\nconsideration for the investigation of the question of specific inductive\r\ncapacity (1277.).\r\n\r\n1242. With a good hemispherical cup of sulphur cast solid and sound, I\r\nobtained the return charge, but only to an amount of 17° or 18°. Thus glass\r\nand sulphur, which are bodily very bad conductors of electricity, and\r\nindeed almost perfect insulators, gave very little of this return charge.\r\n\r\n1243. I tried the same experiment having _air_ only in the inductive\r\napparatus. After a continued high charge for some time I could obtain a\r\nlittle effect of return action, but it was ultimately traced to the\r\nshell-lac of the stem.\r\n\r\n1244. I sought to produce something like this state with one electric power\r\nand without induction; for upon the theory of an electric fluid or fluids,\r\nthat did not seem impossible, and then I should have obtained an absolute\r\ncharge (1169. 1177.), or something equivalent to it. In this I could not\r\nsucceed. I excited the outside of a cylinder of shell-lac very highly for\r\nsome time, and then quickly discharging it (1203.), waited and watched\r\nwhether any return charge would appear, but such was not the case. This is\r\nanother fact in favour of the inseparability of the two electric forces\r\n(1177.), and another argument for the view that induction and its\r\nconcomitant phenomena depend upon a polarity of the particles of matter.\r\n\r\n1245. Although inclined at first to refer these effects to a peculiar\r\nmasked condition of a certain portion of the forces, I think I have since\r\ncorrectly traced them to known principles of electrical action. The effects\r\nappear to be due to an actual penetration of the charge to some distance\r\nwithin the electric, at each of its two surfaces, by what we call\r\n_conduction_; so that, to use the ordinary phrase, the electric forces\r\nsustaining the induction are not upon the metallic surfaces only, but upon\r\nand within the dielectric also, extending to a greater or smaller depth\r\nfrom the metal linings. Let _c_ (fig. 113.) be the section of a plate of\r\nany dielectric, _a_ and _b_ being the metallic coatings; let _b_ be\r\nuninsulated, and _a_ be charged positively; after ten or fifteen minutes,\r\nif _a_ and _b_ be discharged, insulated, and immediately examined, no\r\nelectricity will appear in them; but in a short time, upon a second\r\nexamination, they will appear charged in the same way, though not to the\r\nsame degree, as they were at first. Now suppose that a portion of the\r\npositive force has, under the coercing influence of all the forces\r\nconcerned, penetrated the dielectric and taken up its place at the line\r\n_p_, a corresponding portion of the negative force having also assumed its\r\nposition at the line _n_; that in fact the electric at these two parts has\r\nbecome charged positive and negative; then it is clear that the induction\r\nof these two forces will be much greater one towards the other, and less in\r\nan external direction, now that they are at the small distance _np_ from\r\neach other, than when they were at the larger interval _ab_. Then let _a_\r\nand _b_ be discharged; the discharge destroys or neutralizes all external\r\ninduction, and the coatings are therefore found by the carrier ball\r\nunelectrified; but it also removes almost the whole of the forces by which\r\nthe electric charge was driven into the dielectric, and though probably a\r\npart of that charge goes forward in its passage and terminates in what we\r\ncall discharge, the greater portion returns on its course to the surfaces\r\nof _c_, and consequently to the conductors _a_ and _b_, and constitutes the\r\nrecharge observed.\r\n\r\n1246. The following is the experiment on which I rest for the truth of this\r\nview. Two plates of spermaceti, _d_ and, _f_ (fig. 114.), were put together\r\nto form the dielectric, _a_ and _b_ being the metallic coatings of this\r\ncompound plate, as before. The system was charged, then discharged,\r\ninsulated, examined, and found to give no indications of electricity to the\r\ncarrier ball. The plates _d_ and _f_were then separated from each other,\r\nand instantly _a_ with _d_ was found in a positive state, and _b_ with _f_\r\nin a negative state, nearly all the electricity being in the linings _a_\r\nand _b_. Hence it is clear that, of the forces sought for, the positive was\r\nin one-half of the compound plate and the negative in the other half; for\r\nwhen removed bodily with the plates from each other's inductive influence,\r\nthey appeared in separate places, and resumed of necessity their power of\r\nacting by induction on the electricity of surrounding bodies. Had the\r\neffect depended upon a peculiar relation of the contiguous particles of\r\nmatter only, then each half-plate, _d_ and _f_, should have shown positive\r\nforce on one surface and negative on the other.\r\n\r\n1247. Thus it would appear that the best solid insulators, such as\r\nshell-lac, glass, and sulphur, have conductive properties to such an\r\nextent, that electricity can penetrate them bodily, though always subject\r\nto the overruling condition of induction (1178.). As to the depth to which\r\nthe forces penetrate in this form of charge of the particles,\r\ntheoretically, it should be throughout the mass, for what the charge of the\r\nmetal does for the portion of dielectric next to it, should be close by the\r\ncharged dielectric for the portion next beyond it again; but probably in\r\nthe best insulators the sensible charge is to a very small depth only in\r\nthe dielectric, for otherwise more would disappear in the first instance\r\nwhilst the original charge is sustained, less time would be required for\r\nthe assumption of the particular state, and more electricity would\r\nre-appear as return charge.\r\n\r\n1248. The condition of _time_ required for this penetration of the charge\r\nis important, both as respects the general relation of the cases to\r\nconduction, and also the removal of an objection that might otherwise\r\nproperly be raised to certain results respecting specific inductive\r\ncapacities, hereafter to be given (1269. 1277.)\r\n\r\n1249. It is the assumption for a time of this charged state of the glass\r\nbetween the coatings in the Leyden jar, which gives origin to a well-known\r\nphenomenon, usually referred to the diffusion of electricity over the\r\nuncoated portion of the glass, namely, the _residual charge_. The extent of\r\ncharge which can spontaneously be recovered by a large battery, after\r\nperfect uninsulation of both surfaces, is very considerable, and by far the\r\nlargest portion of this is due to the return of electricity in the manner\r\ndescribed. A plate of shell-lac six inches square, and half an inch thick,\r\nor a similar plate of spermaceti an inch thick, being coated on the sides\r\nwith tinfoil as a Leyden arrangement, will show this effect exceedingly\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1250. The peculiar condition of dielectrics which has now been described,\r\nis evidently capable of producing an effect interfering with the results\r\nand conclusions drawn from the use of the two inductive apparatus, when\r\nshell-lac, glass, &c. is used in one or both of them (1192. 1207.), for\r\nupon dividing the charge in such cases according to the method described\r\n(1198. 1207.), it is evident that the apparatus just receiving its half\r\ncharge must fall faster in its tension than the other. For suppose app. i.\r\nfirst charged, and app. ii. used to divide with it; though both may\r\nactually lose alike, yet app. i., which has been diminished one-half, will\r\nbe sustained by a certain degree of return action or charge (1234.), whilst\r\napp. ii. will sink the more rapidly from the coming on of the particular\r\nstate. I have endeavoured to avoid this interference by performing the\r\nwhole process of comparison as quickly as possible, and taking the force of\r\napp. ii. immediately after the division, before any sensible diminution of\r\nthe tension arising from the assumption of the peculiar state could be\r\nproduced; and I have assumed that as about three minutes pass between the\r\nfirst charge of app. i. and the division, and three minutes between the\r\ndivision and discharge, when the force of the non-transferable electricity\r\nis measured, the contrary tendencies for those periods would keep that\r\napparatus in a moderately steady and uniform condition for the latter\r\nportion of time.\r\n\r\n1251. The particular action described occurs in the shell-lac of the stems,\r\nas well as in the _dielectric_ used within the apparatus. It therefore\r\nconstitutes a cause by which the outside of the stems may in some\r\noperations become charged with electricity, independent of the action of\r\ndust or carrying particles (1203.).\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ v. _On specific induction, or specific inductive capacity._\r\n\r\n1252. I now proceed to examine the great question of specific inductive\r\ncapacity, i.e. whether different dielectric bodies actually do possess any\r\ninfluence over the degree of induction which takes place through them. If\r\nany such difference should exist, it appeared to me not only of high\r\nimportance in the further comprehension of the laws and results of\r\ninduction, but an additional and very powerful argument for the theory I\r\nhave ventured to put forth, that the whole depends upon a molecular action,\r\nin contradistinction to one at sensible distances.\r\n\r\nThe question may be stated thus: suppose A an electrified plate of metal\r\nsuspended in the air, and B and C two exactly similar plates, placed\r\nparallel to and on each side of A at equal distances and uninsulated; A\r\nwill then induce equally towards B and C. If in this position of the plates\r\nsome other dielectric than air, as shell-lac, be introduced between A and\r\nC, will the induction between them remain the same? Will the relation of C\r\nand B to A be unaltered, notwithstanding the difference of the dielectrics\r\ninterposed between them?[A]\r\n\r\n  [A] Refer for the practical illustration of this statement to the\r\n  supplementary note commencing 1307, &c.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1253. As far as I recollect, it is assumed that no change will occur under\r\nsuch variation of circumstances, and that the relations of B find C to A\r\ndepend entirely upon their distance. I only remember one experimental\r\nillustration of the question, and that is by Coulomb[A], in which he shows\r\nthat a wire surrounded by shell-lac took exactly the same quantity of\r\nelectricity from a charged body as the same wire in air. The experiment\r\noffered to me no proof of the truth of the supposition: for it is not the\r\nmere films of dielectric substances surrounding the charged body which have\r\nto be examined and compared, but the _whole mass_ between that body and the\r\nsurrounding conductors at which the induction terminates. Charge depends\r\nupon induction (1171. 1178.); and if induction is related to the particles\r\nof the surrounding dielectric, then it is related to _all_ the particles of\r\nthat dielectric inclosed by the surrounding conductors, and not merely to\r\nthe few situated next to the charged body. Whether the difference I sought\r\nfor existed or not, I soon found reason to doubt the conclusion that might\r\nbe drawn from Coulomb's result; and therefore had the apparatus made,\r\nwhich, with its use, has been already described (1187, &c.), and which\r\nappears to me well-suited for the investigation of the question.\r\n\r\n  [A] Mémoires de l'Académie, 1787, pp. 452, 453.\r\n\r\n1254. Glass, and many bodies which might at first be considered as very fit\r\nto test the principle, proved exceedingly unfit for that purpose. Glass,\r\nprincipally in consequence of the alkali it contains, however well-warmed\r\nand dried it may be, has a certain degree of conducting power upon its\r\nsurface, dependent upon the moisture of the atmosphere, which renders it\r\nunfit for a test experiment. Resin, wax, naphtha, oil of turpentine, and\r\nmany other substances were in turn rejected, because of a slight degree of\r\nconducting power possessed by them; and ultimately shell-lac and sulphur\r\nwere chosen, after many experiments, as the dielectrics best fitted for the\r\ninvestigation. No difficulty can arise in perceiving how the possession of\r\na feeble degree of conducting power tends to make a body produce effects,\r\nwhich would seem to indicate that it had a greater capability of allowing\r\ninduction through it than another body perfect in its insulation. This\r\nsource of error has been that which I have found most difficult to obviate\r\nin the proving experiments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1255. _Induction through shell-lac._--As a preparatory experiment, I first\r\nascertained generally that when a part of the surface of a thick plate of\r\nshell-lac was excited or charged, there was no sensible difference in the\r\ncharacter of the induction sustained by that charged part, whether exerted\r\nthrough the air in the one direction, or through the shell-lac of the plate\r\nin the other; provided the second surface of the plate had not, by contact\r\nwith conductors, the action of dust, or any other means, become charged\r\n(1203.). Its solid condition enabled it to retain the excited particles in\r\na permanent position, but that appeared to be all; for these particles\r\nacted just as freely through the shell-lac on one side as through the air\r\non the other. The same general experiment was made by attaching a disc of\r\ntinfoil to one side of the shell-lac plate, and electrifying it, and the\r\nresults were the same. Scarcely any other solid substance than shell-lac\r\nand sulphur, and no liquid substance that I have tried, will bear this\r\nexamination. Glass in its ordinary state utterly fails; yet it was\r\nessentially necessary to obtain this prior degree of perfection in the\r\ndielectric used, before any further progress could be made in the principal\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n1256. _Shell-lac and air_ were compared in the first place. For this\r\npurpose a thick hemispherical cup of shell-lac was introduced into the\r\nlower hemisphere of one of the inductive apparatus (1187, &c.), so as\r\nnearly to fill the lower half of the space _o, o_ (fig. 104.) between it\r\nand the inner ball; and then charges were divided in the manner already\r\ndescribed (1198. 1207.), each apparatus being used in turn to receive the\r\nfirst charge before its division by the other. As the apparatus were known\r\nto have equal inductive power when air was in both (1209. 1211.), any\r\ndifferences resulting from the introduction of the shell-lac would show a\r\npeculiar action in it, and if unequivocally referable to a specific\r\ninductive influence, would establish the point sought to be sustained. I\r\nhave already referred to the precautions necessary in making the\r\nexperiments (1199, &c.); and with respect to the error which might be\r\nintroduced by the assumption of the peculiar state, it was guarded against,\r\nas far as possible, in the first place, by operating quickly (1248); and,\r\nafterwards, by using that dielectric as glass or sulphur, which assumed the\r\npeculiar state most slowly, and in the least degree (1239. 1241.).\r\n\r\n1257. The shell-lac hemisphere was put into app. i., and app. ii. left\r\nfilled with air. The results of an experiment in which the charge through\r\nair was divided and reduced by the shell-lac app. were as follows:\r\n\r\nApp. i. Lac.   App. ii. Air.\r\n        Balls 255°.\r\n\r\n    0°  . . . .\r\n        . . . .  304°\r\n        . . . .  297\r\n      Charge divided.\r\n   113  . . . .\r\n        . . . .  121\r\n     0  . . . .      after being discharged.\r\n        . . . .    7 after being discharged.\r\n\r\n1258. Here 297°, minus 7°, or 290°, may be taken as the divisible charge of\r\napp. ii. (the 7° being fixed stem action (1203. 1232.)), of which 145° is\r\nthe half. The lac app. i. gave 113° as the power or tension it had acquired\r\nafter division; and the air app. ii. gave 121°, minus 7°, or 114°, as the\r\nforce it possessed from what it retained of the divisible charge of 290°.\r\nThese two numbers should evidently be alike, and they are very nearly so,\r\nindeed far within the errors of experiment and observation, but these\r\nnumbers differ very much from 145°, or the force which the half charge\r\nwould have had if app. i. had contained air instead of shell-lac; and it\r\nappears that whilst in the division the induction through the air has lost\r\n176° of force, that through the lac has only gained 113°.\r\n\r\n1259. If this difference be assumed as depending entirely on the greater\r\nfacility possessed by shell-lac of allowing or causing inductive action\r\nthrough its substance than that possessed by air, then this capacity for\r\nelectric induction would be inversely as the respective loss and gain\r\nindicated above; and assuming the capacity of the air apparatus as 1, that\r\nof the shell-lac apparatus would be 176/113 or 1.55.\r\n\r\n1260. This extraordinary difference was so unexpected in its amount, as to\r\nexcite the greatest suspicion of the general accuracy of the experiment,\r\nthough the perfect discharge of app. i. after the division, showed that the\r\n113° had been taken and given up readily. It was evident that, if it really\r\nexisted, it ought to produce corresponding effects in the reverse order;\r\nand that when induction through shell-lac was converted into induction\r\nthrough air, the force or tension of the whole ought to be _increased_. The\r\napp. i. was therefore charged in the first place, and its force divided\r\nwith app. ii. The following were the results:\r\n\r\nApp. i. Lac.   App. ii. Air.\r\n        . . . .    0°\r\n  215°  . . . .\r\n  204   . . . .\r\n      Charge divided.\r\n        . . . .  118\r\n  118   . . . .\r\n        . . . .    0 after being discharged.\r\n    0   . . . .      after being discharged.\r\n\r\n1261. Here 204° must be the utmost of the divisible charge. The app. i. and\r\napp. ii. present 118° as their respective forces; both now much _above_ the\r\nhalf of the first force, or 102°, whereas in the former case they were\r\nbelow it. The lac app. i. has lost only 86°, yet it has given to the air\r\napp. ii. 118°, so that the lac still appears much to surpass the air, the\r\ncapacity of the lac app. i. to the air app. ii. being as 1.37 to 1.\r\n\r\n1262. The difference of 1.55 and 1.37 as the expression of the capacity for\r\nthe induction of shell-lac seems considerable, but is in reality very\r\nadmissible under the circumstances, for both are in error in _contrary\r\ndirections_. Thus in the last experiment the charge fell from 215° to 204°\r\nby the joint effects of dissipation and absorption (1192. 1250.), during\r\nthe time which elapsed in the electrometer operations, between the\r\napplications of the carrier ball required to give those two results. Nearly\r\nan equal time must have elapsed between the application of the carrier\r\nwhich gave the 204° result, and the division of the charge between the two\r\napparatus; and as the fall in force progressively decreases in amount\r\n(1192.), if in this case it be taken at 6° only, it will reduce the whole\r\ntransferable charge at the time of division to 198° instead of 204°; this\r\ndiminishes the loss of the shell-lac charge to 80° instead of 86°; and then\r\nthe expression of specific capacity for it is increased, and, instead of\r\n1.37, is 1.47 times that of air.\r\n\r\n1263. Applying the same correction to the former experiment in which air\r\nwas _first_ charged, the result is of the _contrary_ kind. No shell-lac\r\nhemisphere was then in the apparatus, and therefore the loss would be\r\nprincipally from dissipation, and not from absorption: hence it would be\r\nnearer to the degree of loss shown by the numbers 304° and 297°, and being\r\nassumed as 6° would reduce the divisible charge to 284°. In that case the\r\nair would have lost 170°, and communicated only 113° to the shell-lac; and\r\nthe relative specific capacity of the latter would appear to be 1.50, which\r\nis very little indeed removed from 1.47, the expression given by the second\r\nexperiment when corrected in the same way.\r\n\r\n1264. The shell-lac was then removed from app. i. and put into app. ii. and\r\nthe experiments of division again made. I give the results, because I think\r\nthe importance of the point justifies and even requires them.\r\n\r\nApp. i. Air.   App. ii. Lac.\r\n        Balls 200°.\r\n\r\n        . . . .    0°.\r\n  286°  . . . .\r\n  283   . . . .\r\n      Charge divided.\r\n        . . . .  110\r\n  109   . . . .\r\n        . . . .    0.25 after discharge.\r\nTrace   . . . .         after discharge.\r\n\r\nHere app. i. retained 109°, having lost 174° in communicating 110° to app.\r\nii.; and the capacity of the air app. is to the lac app., therefore, as 1\r\nto 1.58. If the divided charge be corrected for an assumed loss of only 3°,\r\nbeing the amount of previous loss in the same time, it will make the\r\ncapacity of the shell-lac app. 1.55 only.\r\n\r\n1265. Then app. ii. was charged, and the charge divided thus:\r\n\r\nApp. i. Air.   App. ii. Lac,\r\n    0°   . . . .\r\n         . . . .  250°\r\n         . . . .  251\r\n      Charge divided.\r\n  146    . . . .\r\n         . . . .  149\r\na little . . . .          after discharge.\r\n         . . . . a little after discharge.\r\n\r\nHere app. i. acquired a charge of 146°, while app. ii. lost only 102° in\r\ncommunicating that amount of force; the capacities being, therefore, to\r\neach other as 1 to 1.43. If the whole transferable charge be corrected for\r\na loss of 4° previous to division, it gives the expression of l.49 for the\r\ncapacity of the shell-lac apparatus.\r\n\r\n1266. These four expressions of 1.47, 1.50, 1.55, and 1.49 for the power of\r\nthe shell-lac apparatus, through the different variations of the\r\nexperiment, are very near to each other; the average is close upon 1.5,\r\nwhich may hereafter be used as the expression of the result. It is a very\r\nimportant result; and, showing for this particular piece of shell-lac a\r\ndecided superiority over air in allowing or causing the act of induction,\r\nit proved the growing necessity of a more close and rigid examination of\r\nthe whole question.\r\n\r\n1267. The shell-lac was of the best quality, and had been carefully\r\nselected and cleaned; but as the action of any conducting particles in it\r\nwould tend, virtually, to diminish the quantity or thickness of the\r\ndielectric used, and produce effects as if the two inducing surfaces of the\r\nconductors in that apparatus were nearer together than in the one with air\r\nonly, I prepared another shell-lac hemisphere, of which the material had\r\nbeen dissolved in strong spirit of wine, the solution filtered, and then\r\ncarefully evaporated. This is not an easy operation, for it is difficult to\r\ndrive off the last portions of alcohol without injuring the lac by the heat\r\napplied; and unless they be dissipated, the substance left conducts too\r\nwell to be used in these experiments. I prepared two hemispheres this way,\r\none of them unexceptionable; and with it I repeated the former experiments\r\nwith all precautions. The results were exactly of the same kind; the\r\nfollowing expressions for the capacity of the shell-lac apparatus, whether\r\nit were app. i. or ii., being given directly by the experiments, 1.46,\r\n1.50, 1.52, 1.51; the average of these and several others being very nearly\r\n1.5.\r\n\r\n1268. As a final check upon the general conclusion, I then actually brought\r\nthe surfaces of the air apparatus, corresponding to the place of the\r\nshell-lac in its apparatus, nearer together, by putting a metallic lining\r\ninto the lower hemisphere of the one not containing the lac (1213.). The\r\ndistance of the metal surface from the carrier ball was in this way\r\ndiminished from 0.62 of an inch to 0.435 of an inch, whilst the interval\r\noccupied by the lac in the other apparatus remained O.62 of an inch as\r\nbefore. Notwithstanding this change, the lac apparatus showed its former\r\nsuperiority; and whether it or the air apparatus was charged first, the\r\ncapacity of the lac apparatus to the air apparatus was by the experimental\r\nresults as 1.45 to 1.\r\n\r\n1269. From all the experiments I have made, and their constant results, I\r\ncannot resist the conclusion that shell-lac does exhibit a case of\r\n_specific inductive capacity_. I have tried to check the trials in every\r\nway, and if not remove, at least estimate, every source of error. That the\r\nfinal result is not due to common conduction is shown by the capability of\r\nthe apparatus to retain the communicated charge; that it is not due to the\r\nconductive power of inclosed small particles, by which they could acquire a\r\npolarized condition as conductors, is shown by the effects of the shell-lac\r\npurified by alcohol; and, that it is not due to any influence of the\r\ncharged state, formerly described (1250.), first absorbing and then\r\nevolving electricity, is indicated by the _instantaneous_ assumption and\r\ndischarge of those portions of the power which are concerned in the\r\nphenomena, that instantaneous effect occurring in these cases, as in all\r\nothers of ordinary induction, by charged conductors. The latter argument is\r\nthe more striking in the case where the air apparatus is employed to divide\r\nthe charge with the lac apparatus, for it obtains its portion of\r\nelectricity in an _instant_, and yet is charged far above the _mean_.\r\n\r\n1270. Admitting for the present the general fact sought to be proved; then\r\n1.5, though it expresses the capacity of the apparatus containing the\r\nhemisphere of shell-lac, by no means expresses the relation of lac to air.\r\nThe lac only occupies one-half of the space _o, o_, of the apparatus\r\ncontaining it, through which the induction is sustained; the rest is filled\r\nwith air, as in the other apparatus; and if the effect of the two upper\r\nhalves of the globes be abstracted, then the comparison of the shell-lac\r\npowers in the lower half of the one, with the power of the air in the lower\r\nhalf of the other, will be as 2:1; and even this must be less than the\r\ntruth, for the induction of the upper part of the apparatus, i.e. of the\r\nwire and ball B. (fig. 104.) to external objects, must be the same in both,\r\nand considerably diminish the difference dependent upon, and really\r\nproducible by, the influence of the shell-lac within.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1271. _Glass._--I next worked with glass as the dielectric. It involved the\r\npossibility of conduction on its surface, but it excluded the idea of\r\nconducting particles within its substance (1267.) other than those of its\r\nown mass. Besides this it does not assume the charged state (1239.) so\r\nreadily, or to such an extent, as shell-lac.\r\n\r\n1272. A thin hemispherical cup of glass being made hot was covered with a\r\ncoat of shell-lac dissolved in alcohol, and after being dried for many\r\nhours in a hot place, was put into the apparatus and experimented with. It\r\nexhibited effects so slight, that, though they were in the direction\r\nindicating a superiority of glass over air, they were allowed to pass as\r\npossible errors of experiment; and the glass was considered as producing no\r\nsensible effect.\r\n\r\n1273. I then procured a thick hemispherical flint glass cup resembling that\r\nof shell-lac (1239.), but not filling up the space _o, o_, so well. Its\r\naverage thickness was 0.4 of an inch, there being an additional thickness\r\nof air, averaging 0.22 of an inch, to make up the whole space of 0.62 of an\r\ninch between the inductive metallic surfaces. It was covered with a film of\r\nshell-lac as the former was, (1272.) and being made very warm, was\r\nintroduced into the apparatus, also warmed, and experiments made with it as\r\nin the former instances (1257. &c.). The general results were the same as\r\nwith shell-lac, i.e. glass surpassed air in its power of favouring\r\ninduction through it. The two best results as respected the state of the\r\napparatus for retention of charge, &c., gave, when the air apparatus was\r\ncharged first 1.336, and when the glass apparatus was charged first 1.45,\r\nas the specific inductive capacity for glass, both being without\r\ncorrection. The average of nine results, four with the glass apparatus\r\nfirst charged, and five with the air apparatus first charged, gave 1.38 as\r\nthe power of the glass apparatus; 1.22 and 1.46 being the minimum and\r\nmaximum numbers with all the errors of experiment upon them. In all the\r\nexperiments the glass apparatus took up its inductive charge instantly, and\r\nlost it as readily (1269.); and during the short time of each experiment,\r\nacquired the peculiar state in a small degree only, so that the influence\r\nof this state, and also of conduction upon the results, must have been\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n1274. Allowing specific inductive capacity to be proved and active in this\r\ncase, and 1.38 as the expression for the glass apparatus, then the specific\r\ninductive capacity of flint glass will be above 1.76, not forgetting that\r\nthis expression is for a piece of glass of such thickness as to occupy not\r\nquite two-thirds of the space through which the induction is sustained\r\n(1253. 1273.).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1275. _Sulphur._--The same hemisphere of this substance was used in app.\r\nii. as was formerly referred to (1242.). The experiments were well made,\r\ni.e. the sulphur itself was free from charge both before and after each\r\nexperiment, and no action from the stem appeared (1203. 1232.), so that no\r\ncorrection was required on that account. The following are the results when\r\nthe air apparatus was first charged and divided:\r\n\r\nApp. i. Air,   App. ii. Sulphur.\r\n        Balls 280°.\r\n\r\n    0°  . . . .\r\n        . . . .    0°\r\n  438   . . . .\r\n  434   . . . .\r\n      Charge divided.\r\n        . . . .  162\r\n  164   . . . .\r\n        . . . .  160\r\n  162   . . . .\r\n        . . . .    0 after discharge.\r\n    0   . . . .      after discharge.\r\n\r\nHere app. i. retained 164°, having lost 276° in communicating 162° to app.\r\nii., and the capacity of the air apparatus is to that of the sulphur\r\napparatus as 1 to 1.66.\r\n\r\n1276. Then the sulphur apparatus was charged first, thus:\r\n\r\n        . . . .    0°\r\n    0°  . . . .\r\n        . . . .  395\r\n        . . . .  388\r\n      Charge divided.\r\n  237   . . . .\r\n        . . . .  238\r\n    0   . . . .      after discharge.\r\n        . . . .    0 after discharge.\r\n\r\nHere app. ii. retained 238°, and gave up 150° in communicating a charge of\r\n237° to app. i., and the capacity of the air apparatus is to that of the\r\nsulphur apparatus as 1 to 1.58. These results are very near to each other,\r\nand we may take the mean 1.62 as representing the specific inductive\r\ncapacity of the sulphur apparatus; in which case the specific inductive\r\ncapacity of sulphur itself as compared to air = 1 (1270.) will be about or\r\nabove 2.24.\r\n\r\n1277. This result with sulphur I consider as one of the most\r\nunexceptionable. The substance when fused was perfectly clear, pellucid,\r\nand free from particles of dirt (1267.), so that no interference of small\r\nconducting bodies confused the result. The substance when solid is an\r\nexcellent insulator, and by experiment was found to take up, with great\r\nslowness, that state (1244. 1242.) which alone seemed likely to disturb the\r\nconclusion. The experiments themselves, also, were free from any need of\r\ncorrection. Yet notwithstanding these circumstances, so favourable to the\r\nexclusion of error, the result is a higher specific inductive capacity for\r\nsulphur than for any other body as yet tried; and though this may in part\r\nbe clue to the sulphur being in a better shape, i.e. filling up more\r\ncompletely the space _o, o_, (fig. 104.) than the cups of shell-lac and\r\nglass, still I feel satisfied that the experiments altogether fully prove\r\nthe existence of a difference between dielectrics as to their power of\r\nfavouring an inductive action through them; which difference may, for the\r\npresent, be expressed by the term _specific inductive capacity_.\r\n\r\n1278. Having thus established the point in the most favourable cases that I\r\ncould anticipate, I proceeded to examine other bodies amongst solids,\r\nliquids, and gases. These results I shall give with all convenient brevity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1279. _Spermaceti._--A good hemisphere of spermaceti being tried as to\r\nconducting power whilst its two surfaces were still in contact with the\r\ntinfoil moulds used in forming it, was found to conduct sensibly even\r\nwhilst warm. On removing it from the moulds and using it in one of the\r\napparatus, it gave results indicating a specific inductive capacity between\r\n1.3 and 1.6 for the apparatus containing it. But as the only mode of\r\noperation was to charge the air apparatus, and then after a quick contact\r\nwith the spermaceti apparatus, ascertain what was left in the former\r\n(1281.), no great confidence can be placed in the results. They are not in\r\nopposition to the general conclusion, but cannot be brought forward as\r\nargument in favour of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1280. I endeavoured to find some liquids which would insulate well, and\r\ncould be obtained in sufficient quantity for these experiments. Oil of\r\nturpentine, native naphtha rectified, and the condensed oil gas fluid,\r\nappeared by common experiments to promise best as to insulation. Being left\r\nin contact with fused carbonate of potassa, chloride of lime, and quick\r\nlime for some days and then filtered, they were found much injured in\r\ninsulating power; but after distillation acquired their best state, though\r\neven then they proved to be conductors when extensive metallic contact was\r\nmade with them.\r\n\r\n1281. _Oil of turpentine rectified._--I filled the lower half of app. i.\r\nwith the fluid: and as it would not hold a charge sufficiently to enable me\r\nfirst to measure and then divide it, I charged app. ii. containing air, and\r\ndividing its charge with app. i. by a quick contact, measured that\r\nremaining in app. ii.: for, theoretically, if a quick contact would divide\r\nup to equal tension between the two apparatus, yet without sensible loss\r\nfrom the conducting power of app. i.; and app. ii. were left charged to a\r\ndegree of tension above half the original charge, it would indicate that\r\noil of turpentine had less specific inductive capacity than air; or, if\r\nleft charged below that mean state of tension, it would imply that the\r\nfluid had the greater inductive capacity. In an experiment of this kind,\r\napp. ii. gave as its charge 390° before division with app. i., and 175°\r\nafterwards, which is less than the half of 390°. Again, being at 176°\r\nbefore division, it was 79° after, which is also less than half the divided\r\ncharge. Being at 79°, it was a third time divided, and then fell to 36°,\r\nless than the half of 79°. Such are the best results I could obtain; they\r\nare not inconsistent with the belief that oil of turpentine has a greater\r\nspecific capacity than air, but they do not prove the fact, since the\r\ndisappearance of more than half the charge may be due to the conducting\r\npower merely of the fluid.\r\n\r\n1282. _Naphtha._--This liquid gave results similar in their nature and\r\ndirection to those with oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1283. A most interesting class of substances, in relation to specific\r\ninductive capacity, now came under review, namely, the gases or aëriform\r\nbodies. These are so peculiarly constituted, and are bound together by so\r\nmany striking physical and chemical relations, that I expected some\r\nremarkable results from them: air in various states was selected for the\r\nfirst experiments.\r\n\r\n1284. _Air, rare and dense._--Some experiments of division (1208.) seemed\r\nto show that dense and rare air were alike in the property under\r\nexamination. A simple and better process was to attach one of the apparatus\r\nto an air-pump, to charge it, and then examine the tension of the charge\r\nwhen the air within was more or less rarefied. Under these circumstances it\r\nwas found, that commencing with a certain charge, that charge did not\r\nchange in its tension or force as the air was rarefied, until the\r\nrarefaction was such that _discharge_ across the space _o_, _o_ (fig. 104.)\r\noccurred. This discharge was proportionate to the rarefaction; but having\r\ntaken place, and lowered the tension to a certain degree, that degree was\r\nnot at all affected by restoring the pressure and density of the air to\r\ntheir first quantities.\r\n\r\n                    inches of mercury.\r\nThus at a pressure of 30   the charge was        88°\r\nAgain                 30   the charge was        88\r\nAgain                 30   the charge was        87\r\nReduced to            11   the charge was        87\r\nRaised again to       30   the charge was        86\r\nBeing now reduced to   3.4 the charge fell to    81\r\nRaised again to       30   the charge was still  81\r\n\r\n1285. The charges were low in these experiments, first that they might not\r\npass off at low pressure, and next that little loss by dissipation might\r\noccur. I now reduced them still lower, that I might rarefy further, and for\r\nthis purpose in the following experiment used a measuring interval in the\r\nelectrometer of only 15° (1185.). The pressure of air within the apparatus\r\nbeing reduced to 1.9 inches of mercury, the charge was found to be 29°;\r\nthen letting in air till the pressure was 30 inches, the charge was still\r\n29°.\r\n\r\n1286. These experiments were repeated with pure oxygen with the same\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n1287. This result of _no variation_ in the electric tension being produced\r\nby variation in the density or pressure of the air, agrees perfectly with\r\nthose obtained by Mr. Harris[A], and described in his beautiful and\r\nimportant investigations contained in the Philosophical Transactions;\r\nnamely that induction is the same in rare and dense air, and that the\r\ndivergence of an electrometer under such variations of the air continues\r\nthe same, provided no electricity pass away from it. The effect is one\r\nentirely independent of that power which dense air has of causing a higher\r\ncharge to be _retained_ upon the surface of conductors in it than can be\r\nretained by the same conductors in rare air; a point I propose considering\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, pp. 223, 224, 237, 244.\r\n\r\n1288. I then compared _hot and cold air_ together, by raising the\r\ntemperature of one of the inductive apparatus as high as it could be\r\nwithout injury, and then dividing charges between it and the other\r\napparatus containing cold air. The temperatures were about 50° and 200°,\r\nStill the power or capacity appeared to be unchanged; and when I\r\nendeavoured to vary the experiment, by charging a cold apparatus and then\r\nwarming it by a spirit lamp, I could obtain no proof that the inductive\r\ncapacity underwent any alteration.\r\n\r\n1289. I compared _damp and dry air_ together, but could find no difference\r\nin the results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1290. _Gases._--A very long series of experiments was then undertaken for\r\nthe purpose of comparing _different gases_ one with another. They were all\r\nfound to insulate well, except such as acted on the shell-lac of the\r\nsupporting stem; these were chlorine, ammonia, and muriatic acid. They were\r\nall dried by appropriate means before being introduced into the apparatus.\r\nIt would have been sufficient to have compared each with air; but, in\r\nconsequence of the striking result which came out, namely, that _all had\r\nthe same power of_ or _capacity for_, sustaining induction through them,\r\n(which perhaps might have been expected after it was found that no\r\nvariation of density or pressure produced any effect,) I was induced to\r\ncompare them, experimentally, two and two in various ways, that no\r\ndifference might escape me, and that the sameness of result might stand in\r\nfull opposition to the contrast of property, composition, and condition\r\nwhich the gases themselves presented.\r\n\r\n1291. The experiments were made upon the following pairs of gases.\r\n\r\n 1.  Nitrogen and       Oxygen.\r\n 2.  Oxygen             Air.\r\n 3.  Hydrogen           Air.\r\n 4.  Muriatic acid gas  Air.\r\n 5.  Oxygen             Hydrogen.\r\n 5.  Oxygen             Carbonic acid.\r\n 7.  Oxygen             Olefiant gas.\r\n 8.  Oxygen             Nitrous gas.\r\n 9.  Oxygen             Sulphurous acid.\r\n10. Oxygen              Ammonia.\r\n11. Hydrogen            Carbonic acid.\r\n12  Hydrogen            Olefiant gas.\r\n13. Hydrogen            Sulphurous acid.\r\n14. Hydrogen            Fluo-silicic acid.\r\n15. Hydrogen            Ammonia.\r\n16, Hydrogen            Arseniuretted hydrogen.\r\n17. Hydrogen            Sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n18, Nitrogen            Olefiant gas.\r\n19. Nitrogen            Nitrous gas.\r\n20. Nitrogen            Nitrous oxide.\r\n21.

Ammonia             Sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\n1292. Notwithstanding the striking contrasts of all kinds which these gases\r\npresent of property, of density, whether simple or compound, anions or\r\ncations (665.), of high or low pressure (1284. 1286.), hot or cold (1288.),\r\nnot the least difference in their capacity to favour or admit electrical\r\ninduction through them could be perceived. Considering the point\r\nestablished, that in all these gases induction takes place by an action of\r\ncontiguous particles, this is the more important, and adds one to the many\r\nstriking relations which hold between bodies having the gaseous condition\r\nand form. Another equally important electrical relation, which will be\r\nexamined in the next paper[A], is that which the different gases have to\r\neach other at the _same pressure_ of causing the retention of the _same or\r\ndifferent degrees of charge_ upon conductors in them. These two results\r\nappear to bear importantly upon the subject of electrochemical excitation\r\nand decomposition; for as _all_ these phenomena, different as they seem to\r\nbe, must depend upon the electrical forces of the particles of matter, the\r\nvery distance at which they seem to stand from each other will do much, if\r\nproperly considered, to illustrate the principle by which they are held in\r\none common bond, and subject, as they must be, to one common law.\r\n\r\n  [A] See in relation to this point 1382. &c.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1293. It is just possible that the gases may differ from each other in\r\ntheir specific inductive capacity, and yet by quantities so small as not to\r\nbe distinguished in the apparatus I have used. It must be remembered,\r\nhowever, that in the gaseous experiments the gases occupy all the space _o,\r\no_, (fig. 104.) between the inner and the outer ball, except the small\r\nportion filled by the stem; and the results, therefore, are twice as\r\ndelicate as those with solid dielectrics.\r\n\r\n1294. The insulation was good in all the experiments recorded, except Nos.\r\n10, 15, 21, and 25, being those in which ammonia was compared with other\r\ngases. When shell-lac is put into ammoniacal gas its surface gradually\r\nacquires conducting power, and in this way the lac part of the stem within\r\nwas so altered, that the ammonia apparatus could not retain a charge with\r\nsufficient steadiness to allow of division. In these experiments,\r\ntherefore, the other apparatus was charged; its charge measured and divided\r\nwith the ammonia apparatus by a quick contact, and what remained untaken\r\naway by the division again measured (1281.). It was so nearly one-half of\r\nthe original charge, as to authorize, with this reservation, the insertion\r\nof ammoniacal gas amongst the other gases, as having equal power with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ vi. _General results as to induction._\r\n\r\n1295. Thus _induction_ appears to be essentially an action of contiguous\r\nparticles, through the intermediation of which the electric force,\r\noriginating or appearing at a certain place, is propagated to or sustained\r\nat a distance, appearing there as a force of the same kind exactly equal in\r\namount, but opposite in its direction and tendencies (1164.). Induction\r\nrequires no sensible thickness in the conductors which may be used to limit\r\nits extent; an uninsulated leaf of gold may be made very highly positive on\r\none surface, and as highly negative on the other, without the least\r\ninterference of the two states whilst the inductions continue. Nor is it\r\naffected by the nature of the limiting conductors, provided time be\r\nallowed, in the case of those which conduct slowly, for them to assume\r\ntheir final state (1170.).\r\n\r\n1296. But with regard to the _dielectrics_ or insulating media, matters are\r\nvery different (1167.). Their thickness has an immediate and important\r\ninfluence on the degree of induction. As to their quality, though all gases\r\nand vapours are alike, whatever their state; yet amongst solid bodies, and\r\nbetween them and gases, there are differences which prove the existence of\r\n_specific inductive capacities_, these differences being in some cases very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n1297. The direct inductive force, which may be conceived to be exerted in\r\nlines between the two limiting and charged conducting surfaces, is\r\naccompanied by a lateral or transverse force equivalent to a dilatation or\r\nrepulsion of these representative lines (1224.); or the attractive force\r\nwhich exists amongst the particles of the dielectric in the direction of\r\nthe induction is accompanied by a repulsive or a diverging force in the\r\ntransverse direction (1304.).\r\n\r\n1298. Induction appears to consist in a certain polarized state of the\r\nparticles, into which they are thrown by the electrified body sustaining\r\nthe action, the particles assuming positive and negative points or parts,\r\nwhich are symmetrically arranged with respect to each other and the\r\ninducting surfaces or particles[A]. The state must be a forced one, for it\r\nis originated and sustained only by force, and sinks to the normal or\r\nquiescent state when that force is removed. It can be _continued_ only in\r\ninsulators by the same portion of electricity, because they only can retain\r\nthis state of the particles (1304).\r\n\r\n  [A] The theory of induction which I am stating does not pretend to\r\n  decide whether electricity be a fluid or fluids, or a mere power or\r\n  condition of recognized matter. That is a question which I may be\r\n  induced to consider in the next or following series of these\r\n  researches.\r\n\r\n1299. The principle of induction is of the utmost generality in electric\r\naction. It constitutes charge in every ordinary case, and probably in every\r\ncase; it appears to be the cause of all excitement, and to precede every\r\ncurrent. The degree to which the particles are affected in this their\r\nforced state, before discharge of one kind or another supervenes, appears\r\nto constitute what we call _intensity_.\r\n\r\n1300. When a Leyden jar is _charged_, the particles of the glass are forced\r\ninto this polarized and constrained condition by the electricity of the\r\ncharging apparatus. _Discharge_ is the return of these particles to their\r\nnatural state from their state of tension, whenever the two electric forces\r\nare allowed to be disposed of in some other direction.\r\n\r\n1301. All charge of conductors is on their surface, because being\r\nessentially inductive, it is there only that the medium capable of\r\nsustaining the necessary inductive state begins. If the conductors are\r\nhollow and contain air or any other dielectric, still no _charge_ can\r\nappear upon that internal surface, because the dielectric there cannot\r\nassume the polarized state throughout, in consequence of the opposing\r\nactions in different directions.\r\n\r\n1302. The known influence of _form_ is perfectly consistent with the\r\ncorpuscular view of induction set forth. An electrified cylinder is more\r\naffected by the influence of the surrounding conductors (which complete the\r\ncondition of charge) at the ends than at the middle, because the ends are\r\nexposed to a greater sum of inductive forces than the middle; and a point\r\nis brought to a higher condition than a ball, because by relation to the\r\nconductors around, more inductive force terminates on its surface than on\r\nan equal surface of the ball with which it is compared. Here too,\r\nespecially, can be perceived the influence of the lateral or transverse\r\nforce (1297.), which, being a power of the nature of or equivalent to\r\nrepulsion, causes such a disposition of the lines of inductive force in\r\ntheir course across the dielectric, that they must accumulate upon the\r\npoint, the end of the cylinder, or any projecting part.\r\n\r\n1303. The influence of _distance_ is also in harmony with the same view.\r\nThere is perhaps no distance so great that induction cannot take place\r\nthrough it[A]; but with the same constraining force (1298.) it takes place\r\nthe more easily, according as the extent of dielectric through which it is\r\nexerted is lessened. And as it is assumed by the theory that the particles\r\nof the dielectric, though tending to remain in a normal state, are thrown\r\ninto a forced condition during the induction; so it would seem to follow\r\nthat the fewer there are of these intervening particles opposing their\r\ntendency to the assumption of the new state, the greater degree of change\r\nwill they suffer, i.e. the higher will be the condition they assume, and\r\nthe larger the amount of inductive action exerted through them.\r\n\r\n  [A] I have traced it experimentally from a ball placed in the middle\r\n  of the large cube formerly described (1173.) to the sides of the cube\r\n  six feet distant, and also from the same ball placed in the middle of\r\n  our large lecture-room to the walls of the room at twenty-six feet\r\n  distance, the charge sustained upon the ball in these cases being\r\n  solely due to induction through these distances.\r\n\r\n1304. I have used the phrases _lines of inductive force_ and _curved lines_\r\nof force (1231. 1297. 1298. 1302.) in a general sense only, just as we\r\nspeak of the lines of magnetic force. The lines are imaginary, and the\r\nforce in any part of them is of course the resultant of compound forces,\r\nevery molecule being related to every other molecule in _all_ directions by\r\nthe tension and reaction of those which are contiguous. The transverse\r\nforce is merely this relation considered in a direction oblique to the\r\nlines of inductive force, and at present I mean no more than that by the\r\nphrase. With respect to the term _polarity_ also, I mean at present only a\r\ndisposition of force by which the same molecule acquires opposite powers on\r\ndifferent parts. The particular way in which this disposition is made will\r\ncome into consideration hereafter, and probably varies in different bodies,\r\nand so produces variety of electrical relation[A]. All I am anxious about\r\nat present is, that a more particular meaning should not be attached to the\r\nexpressions used than I contemplate. Further inquiry, I trust, will enable\r\nus by degrees to restrict the sense more and more, and so render the\r\nexplanation of electrical phenomena day by day more and more definite.\r\n\r\n  [A] See now 1685. &c.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1305. As a test of the probable accuracy of my views, I have throughout\r\nthis experimental examination compared them with the conclusions drawn by\r\nM. Poisson from his beautiful mathematical inquiries[A]. I am quite unfit\r\nto form a judgment of these admirable papers; but as far as I can perceive,\r\nthe theory I have set forth and the results I have obtained are not in\r\nopposition to such of those conclusions as represent the final disposition\r\nand state of the forces in the limited number of cases be has considered.\r\nHis theory assumes a very different mode of action in induction to that\r\nwhich I have ventured to support, and would probably find its mathematical\r\ntest in the endeavour to apply it to cases of induction in curved lines. To\r\nmy feeling it is insufficient in accounting for the retention of\r\nelectricity upon the surface of conductors by the pressure of the air, an\r\neffect which I hope to show is simple and consistent according to the\r\npresent view[B]; and it does not touch voltaic electricity, or in any way\r\nassociate it and what is called ordinary electricity under one common\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n  [A] Mémoires de L'Institut, 1811, tom. xii. the first page 1, and the\r\nsecond paging 163.\r\n\r\n  [B] Refer to 1377, 1378, 1379, 1398.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\nI have also looked with some anxiety to the results which that\r\nindefatigable philosopher Harris has obtained in his investigation of the\r\nlaws of induction[A], knowing that they were experimental, and having a\r\nfull conviction of their exactness; but I am happy in perceiving no\r\ncollision at present between them and the views I have taken.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 213.\r\n\r\n1306. Finally, I beg to say that I put forth my particular view with doubt\r\nand fear, lest it should not bear the test of general examination, for\r\nunless true it will only embarrass the progress of electrical science. It\r\nhas long been on my mind, but I hesitated to publish it until the\r\nincreasing persuasion of its accordance with all known facts, and the\r\nmanner in which it linked together effects apparently very different in\r\nkind, urged me to write the present paper. I as yet see no inconsistency\r\nbetween it and nature, but, on the contrary, think I perceive much new\r\nlight thrown by it on her operations; and my next papers will be devoted to\r\na review of the phenomena of conduction, electrolyzation, current,\r\nmagnetism, retention, discharge, and some other points, with an application\r\nof the theory to these effects, and an examination of it by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nNovember 16, 1837._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Supplementary Note to Experimental Researches in Electricity._\r\n\r\n_Eleventh Series._\r\n\r\nReceived March 29, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n1307. I have recently put into an experimental form that general statement\r\nof the question of _specific inductive capacity_ which is given at No. 1252\r\nof Series XI., and the result is such as to lead me to hope the Council of\r\nthe Royal Society will authorize its addition to the paper in the form of a\r\nsupplementary note. Three circular brass plates, about five inches in\r\ndiameter, were mounted side by side upon insulating pillars; the middle\r\none, A, was a fixture, but the outer plates B and C were moveable on\r\nslides, so that all three could be brought with their sides almost into\r\ncontact, or separated to any required distance. Two gold leaves were\r\nsuspended in a glass jar from insulated wires; one of the outer plates B\r\nwas connected with one of the gold leaves, and the other outer plate with\r\nthe other leaf. The outer plates B and C were adjusted at the distance of\r\nan inch and a quarter from the middle plate A, and the gold leaves were\r\nfixed at two inches apart; A was then slightly charged with electricity,\r\nand the plates B and C, with their gold leaves, thrown out of insulation\r\n_at the same time_, and then left insulated. In this state of things A was\r\ncharged positive inductrically, and B and C negative inducteously; the same\r\ndielectric, air, being in the two intervals, and the gold leaves hanging,\r\nof course, parallel to each other in a relatively unelectrified state.\r\n\r\n1308. A plate of shell-lac three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and four\r\ninches square, suspended by clean white silk thread, was very carefully\r\ndeprived of all charge (1203.) (so that it produced no effect on the gold\r\nleaves if A were uncharged) and then introduced between plates A and B; the\r\nelectric relation of the three plates was immediately altered, and the gold\r\nleaves attracted each other. On removing the shell-lac this attraction\r\nceased; on introducing it between A and C it was renewed; on removing it\r\nthe attraction again ceased; and the shell-lac when examined by a delicate\r\nCoulomb electrometer was still without charge.\r\n\r\n1309. As A was positive, B and C were of course negative; but as the\r\nspecific inductive capacity of shell-lac is about twice that of air\r\n(1270.), it was expected that when the lac was introduced between A and B,\r\nA would induce more towards B than towards C; that therefore B would become\r\nmore negative than before towards A, and consequently, because of its\r\ninsulated condition, be positive externally, as at its back or at the gold\r\nleaves; whilst C would be less negative towards A, and therefore negative\r\noutwards or at the gold leaves. This was found to be the case; for on\r\nwhichever side of A the shell-lac was introduced the external plate at that\r\nside was positive, and the external plate on the other side negative\r\ntowards each other, and also to uninsulated external bodies.\r\n\r\n1310. On employing a plate of sulphur instead of shell-lac, the same\r\nresults were obtained; consistent with the conclusions drawn regarding the\r\nhigh specific inductive capacity of that body already given (1276.).\r\n\r\n1311. These effects of specific inductive capacity can be exalted in\r\nvarious ways, and it is this capability which makes the great value of the\r\napparatus. Thus I introduced the shell-lac between A and B, and then for a\r\nmoment connected B and C, uninsulated them, and finally left them in the\r\ninsulated state; the gold leaves were of course hanging parallel to each\r\nother. On removing the shell-lac the gold leaves attracted each other; on\r\nintroducing the shell-lac between A and C this attraction was _increased_,\r\n(as had been anticipated from theory,) and the leaves came together, though\r\nnot more than four inches long, and hanging three inches apart.\r\n\r\n1312. By simply bringing the gold leaves nearer to each other I was able to\r\nshow the difference of specific inductive capacity when only thin plates of\r\nshell-lac were used, the rest of the dielectric space being filled with\r\nair. By bringing B and C nearer to A another great increase of sensibility\r\nwas made. By enlarging the size of the plates still further power was\r\ngained. By diminishing the extent of the wires, &c. connected with the gold\r\nleaves, another improvement resulted. So that in fact the gold leaves\r\nbecame, in this manner, as delicate a test of _specific inductive action_\r\nas they are, in Bennet's and Singer's electrometers, of ordinary electrical\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n1313. It is evident that by making the three plates the sides of cells,\r\nwith proper precautions as regards insulation, &c., this apparatus may be\r\nused in the examination of gases, with far more effect than the former\r\napparatus (1187. 1290), and may, perhaps, bring out differences which have\r\nas yet escaped me (1292. 1293.)\r\n\r\n1314. It is also evident that two metal plates are quite sufficient to form\r\nthe instrument; the state of the single inducteous plate when the\r\ndielectric is changed, being examined either by bringing a body excited in\r\na known manner towards its gold leaves, or, what I think will be better,\r\nemploying a carrier ball in place of the leaf, and examining that ball by\r\nthe Coulomb electrometer (1180.). The inductive and inducteous surfaces may\r\neven be balls; the latter being itself the carrier ball of the Coulomb's\r\nelectrometer (1181. 1229.).\r\n\r\n1315. To increase the effect, a small condenser may be used with great\r\nadvantage. Thus if, when two inducteous plates are used, a little condenser\r\nwere put in the place of the gold leaves, I have no doubt the three\r\nprincipal plates might be reduced to an inch or even half an inch in\r\ndiameter. Even the gold leaves act to each other for the time as the plates\r\nof a condenser. If only two plates were used, by the proper application of\r\nthe condenser the same reduction might take place. This expectation is\r\nfully justified by an effect already observed and described (1229.).\r\n\r\n1316. In that case the application of the instrument to very extensive\r\nresearch is evident. Comparatively small masses of dielectrics could be\r\nexamined, as diamonds and crystals. An expectation, that the specific\r\ninductive capacity of crystals will vary in different directions, according\r\nas the lines of inductive force (1304.) are parallel to, or in other\r\npositions in relation to the axes of the crystals, can be tested[A]: I\r\npurpose that these and many other thoughts which arise respecting specific\r\ninductive action and the polarity of the particles of dielectric matter,\r\nshall be put to the proof as soon as I can find time.\r\n\r\n  [A] Refer for this investigation to 1680-1698.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1317. Hoping that this apparatus will form an instrument of considerable\r\nuse, I beg to propose for it (at the suggestion of a friend) the name of\r\n_Differential Inductometer_.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nMarch 29, 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWELFTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n§ 18. _On Induction (continued)._ ¶ vii. _Conduction, or conductive\r\ndischarge._ ¶ viii. _Electrolytic discharge._ ¶ ix. _Disruptive\r\ndischarge--Insulation--Spark--Brush--Difference of discharge at the\r\npositive and negative surfaces of conductors._\r\n\r\nReceived January 11,--Read February 8, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n1318. I Proceed now, according to my promise, to examine, by the great\r\nfacts of electrical science, that theory of induction which I have ventured\r\nto put forth (1165. 1295. &c.). The principle of induction is so universal\r\nthat it pervades all electrical phenomena; but the general case which I\r\npurpose at present to go into consists of insulation traced into and\r\nterminating with discharge, with the accompanying effects. This case\r\nincludes the various _modes_ of discharge, and also the condition and\r\ncharacters of a current; the elements of magnetic action being amongst the\r\nlatter. I shall necessarily have occasion to speak theoretically, and even\r\nhypothetically; and though these papers profess to be experimental\r\nresearches, I hope that, considering the facts and investigations contained\r\nin the last series in support of the particular view advanced, I shall not\r\nbe considered as taking too much liberty on the present occasion, or as\r\ndeparting too far from the character which they ought to have, especially\r\nas I shall use every opportunity which presents itself of returning to that\r\nstrong test of truth, experiment.\r\n\r\n1319. Induction has as yet been considered in these papers only in cases of\r\ninsulation; opposed to insulation is _discharge_. The action or effect\r\nwhich may be expressed by the general term _discharge_, may take place, as\r\nfar as we are aware at present, in several modes. Thus, that which is\r\ncalled simply _conduction_ involves no chemical action, and apparently no\r\ndisplacement of the particles concerned. A second mode may be called\r\n_electrolytic discharge_; in it chemical action does occur, and particles\r\nmust, to a certain degree, be displaced. A third mode, namely, that by\r\nsparks or brushes, may, because of its violent displacement of the\r\nparticles of the _dielectric_ in its course, be called the _disruptive\r\ndischarge_; and a fourth may, perhaps, be conveniently distinguished for a\r\ntime by the words _convection_, or _carrying discharge_, being that in\r\nwhich discharge is effected either by the carrying power of solid\r\nparticles, or those of gases and liquids. Hereafter, perhaps, all these\r\nmodes may appear as the result of one common principle, but at present they\r\nrequire to be considered apart; and I will now speak of the _first_ mode,\r\nfor amongst all the forms of discharge, that which we express by the term\r\nconduction appears the most simple and the most directly in contrast with\r\ninsulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ vii. _Conduction, or conductive discharge._\r\n\r\n1320. Though assumed to be essentially different, yet neither Cavendish nor\r\nPoisson attempt to explain by, or even state in, their theories, what the\r\nessential difference between insulation and conduction is. Nor have I\r\nanything, perhaps, to offer in this respect, _except_ that, according to my\r\nview of induction, insulation and conduction depend upon the same molecular\r\naction of the dielectrics concerned; are only extreme degrees of _one\r\ncommon condition_ or effect; and in any sufficient mathematical theory of\r\nelectricity must be taken as cases of the same kind. Hence the importance\r\nof the endeavour to show the connection between them under my theory of the\r\nelectrical relations of contiguous particles.\r\n\r\n1321. Though the action of the insulating dielectric in the charged Leyden\r\njar, and that of the wire in discharging it, may seem very different, they\r\nmay be associated by numerous intermediate links, which carry us on from\r\none to the other, leaving, I think, no necessary connection unsupplied. We\r\nmay observe some of these in succession for information respecting the\r\nwhole case.\r\n\r\n1322. Spermnceti has been examined and found to be a dielectric, through\r\nwhich induction can take place (1240. 1246.), its specific inductive\r\ncapacity being about or above 1.8 (1279.), and the inductive action has\r\nbeen considered in it, as in all other substances, an action of contiguous\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\n1323. But spermaceti is also a _conductor_, though in so low a degree that\r\nwe can trace the process of conduction, as it were, step by step through\r\nthe mass (1247.); and even when the electric force has travelled through it\r\nto a certain distance, we can, by removing the coercitive (which is at the\r\nsame time the inductive) force, cause it to return upon its path and\r\nreappear in its first place (1245. 1246.). Here induction appears to be a\r\nnecessary preliminary to conduction. It of itself brings the contiguous\r\nparticles of the dielectric into a certain condition, which, if retained by\r\nthem, constitutes _insulation_, but if lowered by the communication of\r\npower from one particle to another, constitutes _conduction_.\r\n\r\n1324. If _glass_ or _shell-lac_ be the substances under consideration, the\r\nsame capabilities of suffering either induction or conduction through them\r\nappear (1233. 1239. 1247.), but not in the same degree. The conduction\r\nalmost disappears (1239. 1242.); the induction therefore is sustained, i.e.\r\nthe polarized state into which the inductive force has brought the\r\ncontiguous particles is retained, there being little discharge action\r\nbetween them, and therefore the _insulation_ continues. But, what discharge\r\nthere is, appears to be consequent upon that condition of the particles\r\ninto which the induction throws them; and thus it is that ordinary\r\ninsulation and conduction are closely associated together or rather are\r\nextreme cases of one common condition.\r\n\r\n1325. In ice or water we have a better conductor than spermaceti, and the\r\nphenomena of induction and insulation therefore rapidly disappear, because\r\nconduction quickly follows upon the assumption of the inductive state. But\r\nlet a plate of cold ice have metallic coatings on its sides, and connect\r\none of these with a good electrical machine in work, and the other with the\r\nground, and it then becomes easy to observe the phenomena of induction\r\nthrough the ice, by the electrical tension which can be obtained and\r\ncontinued on both the coatings (419. 426.). For although that portion of\r\npower which at one moment gave the inductive condition to the particles is\r\nat the next lowered by the consequent discharge due to the conductive act,\r\nit is succeeded by another portion of force from the machine to restore the\r\ninductive state. If the ice be converted into water the same succession of\r\nactions can be just as easily proved, provided the water be distilled, and\r\n(if the machine be not powerful enough) a voltaic battery be employed.\r\n\r\n1326. All these considerations impress my mind strongly with the\r\nconviction, that insulation and ordinary conduction cannot be properly\r\nseparated when we are examining into their nature; that is, into the\r\ngeneral law or laws under which their phenomena are produced. They appear\r\nto me to consist in an action of contiguous particles dependent on the\r\nforces developed in electrical excitement; these forces bring the particles\r\ninto a state of tension or polarity, which constitutes both _induction_ and\r\n_insulation_; and being in this state, the continuous particles have a\r\npower or capability of communicating their forces one to the other, by\r\nwhich they are lowered, and discharge occurs. Every body appears to\r\ndischarge (444. 987.); but the possession of this capability in a _greater\r\nor smaller degree_ in different bodies, makes them better or worse\r\nconductors, worse or better insulators; and both _induction_ and\r\n_conduction_ appear to be the same in their principle and action (1320.),\r\nexcept that in the latter an effect common to both is raised to the highest\r\ndegree, whereas in the former it occurs in the best cases, in only an\r\nalmost insensible quantity.\r\n\r\n1327. That in our attempts to penetrate into the nature of electrical\r\naction, and to deduce laws more general than those we are at present\r\nacquainted with, we should endeavour to bring apparently opposite effects\r\nto stand side by side in harmonious arrangement, is an opinion of long\r\nstanding, and sanctioned by the ablest philosophers. I hope, therefore, I\r\nmay be excused the attempt to look at the highest cases of conduction as\r\nanalogous to, or even the same in kind with, those of induction and\r\ninsulation.\r\n\r\n1328. If we consider the slight penetration of sulphur (1241. 1242.) or\r\nshell-lac (1234.) by electricity, or the feebler insulation sustained by\r\nspermaceti (1279. 1240.), as essential consequences and indications of\r\ntheir _conducting_ power, then may we look on the resistance of metallic\r\nwires to the passage of electricity through them as _insulating_ power. Of\r\nthe numerous well-known cases fitted to show this resistance in what are\r\ncalled the perfect conductors, the experiments of Professor Wheatstone best\r\nserve my present purpose, since they were carried to such an extent as to\r\nshow that _time_ entered as an element into the conditions of conduction[A]\r\neven in metals. When discharge was made through a copper wire 2640 feet in\r\nlength, and 1/15th of an inch in diameter, so that the luminous sparks at\r\neach end of the wire, and at the middle, could be observed in the same\r\nplace, the latter was found to be sensibly behind the two former in time,\r\nthey being by the conditions of the experiment simultaneous. Hence a proof\r\nof retardation; and what reason can be given why this retardation should\r\nnot be of the same kind as that in spermaceti, or in lac, or sulphur? But\r\nas, in them, retardation is insulation, and insulation is induction, why\r\nshould we refuse the same relation to the same exhibitions of force in the\r\nmetals?\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 583.\r\n\r\n1329. We learn from the experiment, that if _time_ be allowed the\r\nretardation is gradually overcome; and the same thing obtains for the\r\nspermaceti, the lac, and glass (1248.); give but time in proportion to the\r\nretardation, and the latter is at last vanquished. But if that be the case,\r\nand all the results are alike in kind, the only difference being in the\r\nlength of time, why should we refuse to metals the previous inductive\r\naction, which is admitted to occur in the other bodies? The diminution of\r\n_time_ is no negation of the action; nor is the lower degree of tension\r\nrequisite to cause the forces to traverse the metal, as compared to that\r\nnecessary in the cases of water, spermaceti, or lac. These differences\r\nwould only point to the conclusion, that in metals the particles under\r\ninduction can transfer their forces when at a lower degree of tension or\r\npolarity, and with greater facility than in the instances of the other\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n1330. Let us look at Mr. Wheatstone's beautiful experiment in another point\r\nof view, If, leaving the arrangement at the middle and two ends of the long\r\ncopper wire unaltered, we remove the two intervening portions and replace\r\nthem by wires of iron or platina, we shall have a much greater retardation\r\nof the middle spark than before. If, removing the iron, we were to\r\nsubstitute for it only five or six feet of water in a cylinder of the same\r\ndiameter as the metal, we should have still greater retardation. If from\r\nwater we passed to spermaceti, either directly or by gradual steps through\r\nother bodies, (even though we might vastly enlarge the bulk, for the\r\npurpose of evading the occurrence of a spark elsewhere (1331.) than at the\r\nthree proper intervals,) we should have still greater retardation, until at\r\nlast we might arrive, by degrees so small as to be inseparable from each\r\nother, at actual and permanent insulation. What, then, is to separate the\r\nprinciple of these two extremes, perfect conduction and perfect insulation,\r\nfrom each other; since the moment we leave in the smallest degree\r\nperfection at either extremity, we involve the element of perfection at the\r\nopposite end? Especially too, as we have not in nature the case of\r\nperfection either at one extremity or the other, either of insulation or\r\nconduction.\r\n\r\n1331. Again, to return to this beautiful experiment in the various forms\r\nwhich may be given to it: the forces are not all in the wire (after they\r\nhave left the Leyden jar) during the whole time (1328.) occupied by the\r\ndischarge; they are disposed in part through the surrounding dielectric\r\nunder the well-known form of induction; and if that dielectric be air,\r\ninduction takes place from the wire through the air to surrounding\r\nconductors, until the ends of the wire are electrically related through its\r\nlength, and discharge has occurred, i.e. for the _time_ during which the\r\nmiddle spark is retarded beyond the others. This is well shown by the old\r\nexperiment, in which a long wire is so bent that two parts (Plate VIII.\r\nfig. 115.), _a, b_, near its extremities shall approach within a short\r\ndistance, as a quarter of an inch, of each other in the air. If the\r\ndischarge of a Leyden jar, charged to a sufficient degree, be sent through\r\nsuch a wire, by far the largest portion of the electricity will pass as a\r\nspark across the air at the interval, and not by the metal. Does not the\r\nmiddle part of the wire, therefore, act here as an insulating medium,\r\nthough it be of metal? and is not the spark through the air an indication\r\nof the tension (simultaneous with _induction_) of the electricity in the\r\nends of this single wire? Why should not the wire and the air both be\r\nregarded as dielectrics; and the action at its commencement, and whilst\r\nthere is tension, as an inductive action? If it acts through the contorted\r\nlines of the wire, so it also does in curved and contorted lines through\r\nair (1219, 1224, 1231.), and other insulating dielectrics (1228); and we\r\ncan apparently go so far in the analogy, whilst limiting the case to the\r\ninductive action only, as to show that amongst insulating dielectrics some\r\nlead away the lines of force from others (1229.), as the wire will do from\r\nworse conductors, though in it the principal effect is no doubt due to the\r\nready discharge between the particles whilst in a low state of tension. The\r\nretardation is for the time insulation; and it seems to me we may just as\r\nfairly compare the air at the interval _a, b_ (fig. 115.) and the wire in\r\nthe circuit, as two bodies of the same kind and acting upon the same\r\nprinciples, as far as the first inductive phenomena are concerned,\r\nnotwithstanding the different forms of discharge which ultimately\r\nfollow[A], as we may compare, according to Coulomb's investigations[B]\r\n_different lengths_ of different insulating bodies required to produce the\r\nsame amount of insulating effect.\r\n\r\n  [A] These will be examined hereafter (1348. &c.).\r\n\r\n  [B] Mémoires de l'Académie, 1785, p. 612. or Ency. Britann. First\r\n  Supp. vol. i. p. 614.\r\n\r\n1332. This comparison is still more striking when we take into\r\nconsideration the experiment of Mr. Harris, in which he stretched a fine\r\nwire across a glass globe, the air within being rarefied[A]. On sending a\r\ncharge through the joint arrangement of metal and rare air, as much, if not\r\nmore, electricity passed by the latter as by the former. In the air,\r\nrarefied as it was, there can be no doubt the discharge was preceded by\r\ninduction (1284.); and to my mind all the circumstances indicate that the\r\nsame was the case with the metal; that, in fact, both substances are\r\ndielectrics, exhibiting the same effects in consequence of the action of\r\nthe same causes, the only variation being one of degree in the different\r\nsubstances employed.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p, 212.\r\n\r\n1333. Judging on these principles, velocity of discharge through the _same\r\nwire_ may be varied greatly by attending to the circumstances which cause\r\nvariations of discharge through spermaceti or sulphur. Thus, for instance,\r\nit must vary with the tension or intensity of the first urging force (1234.\r\n1240.), which tension is charge and induction. So if the two ends of the\r\nwire, in Professor Wheatstone's experiment, were immediately connected with\r\ntwo large insulated metallic surfaces exposed to the air, so that the\r\nprimary act of induction, after making the contact for discharge, might be\r\nin part removed from the internal portion of the wire at the first instant,\r\nand disposed for the moment on its surface jointly with the air and\r\nsurrounding conductors, then I venture to anticipate that the middle spark\r\nwould be more retarded than before; and if these two plates were the inner\r\nand outer coating of a large jar or a Leyden battery, then the retardation\r\nof that spark would be still greater.\r\n\r\n1334. Cavendish was perhaps the first to show distinctly that discharge was\r\nnot always by one channel[A], but, if several are present, by many at once.\r\nWe may make these different channels of different bodies, and by\r\nproportioning their thicknesses and lengths, may include such substances as\r\nair, lac, spermaceti, water, protoxide of iron, iron and silver, and by\r\n_one_ discharge make each convey its proportion of the electric force.\r\nPerhaps the air ought to be excepted, as its discharge by conduction is\r\nquestionable at present (1336.); but the others may all be limited in their\r\nmode of discharge to pure conduction. Yet several of them suffer previous\r\ninduction, precisely like the induction through the air, it being a\r\nnecessary preliminary to their discharging action. How can we therefore\r\nseparate any one of these bodies from the others, as to the _principles and\r\nmode_ of insulating and conducting, except by mere degree? All seem to me\r\nto be dielectrics acting alike, and under the same common laws.\r\n\r\n  [A] _Philosophical Transactions_, 1776, p. 197.\r\n\r\n1335. I might draw another argument in favour of the general sameness, in\r\nnature and action, of good and bad conductors (and all the bodies I refer\r\nto are conductors more or less), from the perfect equipoise in action of\r\nvery different bodies when opposed to each other in magneto-electric\r\ninductive action, as formerly described (213.), but am anxious to be as\r\nbrief as is consistent with the clear examination of the probable truth of\r\nmy views.\r\n\r\n1336. With regard to the possession by the gases of any conducting power\r\nof the simple kind now under consideration, the question is a very\r\ndifficult one to determine at present. Experiments seem to indicate that\r\nthey do insulate certain low degrees of tension perfectly, and that the\r\neffects which may have appeared to be occasioned by _conduction_ have been\r\nthe result of the carrying power of the charged particles, either of the\r\nair or of dust, in it. It is equally certain, however, that with higher\r\ndegrees of tension or charge the particles discharge to one another, and\r\nthat is conduction. If the gases possess the power of insulating a certain\r\nlow degree of tension continuously and perfectly, such a result may be due\r\nto their peculiar physical state, and the condition of separation under\r\nwhich their particles are placed. But in that, or in any case, we must not\r\nforget the fine experiments of Cagniard de la Tour[A], in which he has\r\nshown that liquids and their vapours can be made to pass gradually into\r\neach other, to the entire removal of any marked distinction of the two\r\nstates. Thus, hot dry steam and cold water pass by insensible gradations\r\ninto each other; yet the one is amongst the gases as an insulator, and the\r\nother a comparatively good conductor. As to conducting power, therefore,\r\nthe transition from metals even up to gases is gradual; substances make but\r\none series in this respect, and the various cases must come under one\r\ncondition and law (444.). The specific differences of bodies as to\r\nconducting power only serves to strengthen the general argument, that\r\nconduction, like insulation, is a result of induction, and is an action of\r\ncontiguous particles.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annales de Chimie, xxi. pp. 127, 178, or Quarterly Journal of\r\n  Science, xv. 145.\r\n\r\n1337. I might go on now to consider induction and its concomitant,\r\n_conduction_, through mixed dielectrics, as, for instance, when a charged\r\nbody, instead of acting across air to a distant uninsulated conductor, acts\r\njointly through it and an interposed insulated conductor. In such a case,\r\nthe air and the conducting body are the mixed dielectrics; and the latter\r\nassumes a polarized condition as a mass, like that which my theory assumes\r\n_each particle_ of the air to possess at the same time (1679). But I fear\r\nto be tedious in the present condition of the subject, and hasten to the\r\nconsideration of other matter.\r\n\r\n1338. To sum up, in some degree, what has been said, I look upon the first\r\neffect of an excited body upon neighbouring matters to be the production of\r\na polarized state of their particles, which constitutes _induction_; and\r\nthis arises from its action upon the particles in immediate contact with\r\nit, which again act upon those contiguous to them, and thus the forces are\r\ntransferred to a distance. If the induction remain undiminished, then\r\nperfect insulation is the consequence; and the higher the polarized\r\ncondition which the particles can acquire or maintain, the higher is the\r\nintensity which may be given to the acting forces. If, on the contrary, the\r\ncontiguous particles, upon acquiring the polarized state, have the power to\r\ncommunicate their forces, then conduction occurs, and the tension is\r\nlowered, conduction being a distinct act of discharge between neighbouring\r\nparticles. The lower the state of tension at which this discharge between\r\nthe particles of a body takes place, the better conductor is that body. In\r\nthis view, insulators may be said to be bodies whose particles can retain\r\nthe polarized state; whilst conductors are those whose particles cannot be\r\npermanently polarized. If I be right in my view of induction, then I\r\nconsider the reduction of these two effects (which have been so long held\r\ndistinct) to an action of contiguous particles obedient to one common law,\r\nas a very important result; and, on the other hand, the identity of\r\ncharacter which the two acquire when viewed by the theory (1326.), is\r\nadditional presumptive proof in favour of the correctness of the latter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1339. That heat has great influence over simple conduction is well known\r\n(445.), its effect being, in some cases, almost an entire change of the\r\ncharacters of the body (432. 1340.). Harris has, however, shown that it in\r\nno respect affects gaseous bodies, or at least air[A]; and Davy has taught\r\nus that, as a class, metals have their conducting power _diminished_ by\r\nit[B].\r\n\r\n  [A] _Philosophical Transactions_, 1834, p. 230\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. 1821, p. 431.\r\n\r\n1340. I formerly described a substance, sulphuret of silver, whose\r\nconducting power was increased by heat (433. 437. 438.); and I have since\r\nthen met with another as strongly affected in the same way: this is\r\nfluoride of lead. When a piece of that substance, which had been fused and\r\ncooled, was introduced into the circuit of a voltaic battery, it stopped\r\nthe current. Being heated, it acquired conducting powers before it was\r\nvisibly red-hot in daylight; and even sparks could be taken against it\r\nwhilst still solid. The current alone then raised its temperature (as in\r\nthe case of sulphuret of silver) until it fused, after which it seemed to\r\nconduct as well as the metallic vessel containing it; for whether the wire\r\nused to complete the circuit touched the fused fluoride only, or was in\r\ncontact with the platina on which it was supported, no sensible difference\r\nin the force of the current was observed. During all the time there was\r\nscarcely a trace of decomposing action of the fluoride, and what did occur,\r\nseemed referable to the air and moisture of the atmosphere, and not to\r\nelectrolytic action.\r\n\r\n1341. I have now very little doubt that periodide of mercury (414. 448.\r\n691.) is a case of the same kind, and also corrosive sublimate (692.). I am\r\nalso inclined to think, since making the above experiments, that the\r\nanomalous action of the protoxide of antimony, formerly observed and\r\ndescribed (693. 801.), may be referred in part to the same cause.\r\n\r\n1342. I have no intention at present of going into the particular relation\r\nof heat and electricity, but we may hope hereafter to discover by\r\nexperiment the law which probably holds together all the above effects with\r\nthose of the _evolution_ and the _disappearance_ of heat by the current,\r\nand the striking and beautiful results of thermo-electricity, in one common\r\nbond.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ viii. _Electrolytic discharge._\r\n\r\n1343. I have already expressed in a former paper (1164.), the view by which\r\nI hope to associate ordinary induction and electrolyzation. Under that\r\nview, the discharge of electric forces by electrolyzation is rather an\r\neffect superadded, in a certain class of bodies, to those already described\r\nas constituting induction and insulation, than one independent of and\r\ndistinct from these phenomena.\r\n\r\n1344. Electrolytes, as respects their insulating and conducting forces,\r\nbelong to the general category of bodies (1320. 1334.); and if they are in\r\nthe solid state (as nearly all can assume that state), they retain their\r\nplace, presenting then no new phenomenon (426. &c.); or if one occur, being\r\nin so small a proportion as to be almost unimportant. When liquefied, they\r\nalso belong to the same list whilst the electric intensity is below a\r\ncertain degree; but at a given intensity (910. 912. 1007.), fixed for each,\r\nand very low in all known cases, they play a new part, causing discharge in\r\nproportion (783.) to the development of certain chemical effects of\r\ncombination and decomposition; and at this point, move out from the general\r\nclass of insulators and conductors, to form a distinct one by themselves.\r\nThe former phenomena have been considered (1320. 1338.); it is the latter\r\nwhich have now to be revised, and used as a test of the proposed theory of\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\n1345. The theory assumes, that the particles of the dielectric (now an\r\nelectrolyte) are in the first instance brought, by ordinary inductive\r\naction, into a polarized state, and raised to a certain degree of tension\r\nor intensity before discharge commences; the inductive state being, in\r\nfact, a _necessary preliminary_ to discharge. By taking advantage of those\r\ncircumstances which bear upon the point, it is not difficult to increase\r\nthe tension indicative of this state of induction, and so make the state\r\nitself more evident. Thus, if distilled water be employed, and a long\r\nnarrow portion of it placed between the electrodes of a powerful voltaic\r\nbattery, we have at once indications of the intensity which can be\r\nsustained at these electrodes by the inductive action through the water as\r\na dielectric, for sparks may be obtained, gold leaves diverged, and Leyden\r\nbottles charged at their wires. The water is in the condition of the\r\nspermaceti (1322. 1323.) a bad conductor and a bad insulator; but what it\r\ndoes insulate is by virtue of inductive action, and that induction is the\r\npreparation for and precursor of discharge (1338.).\r\n\r\n1346. The induction and tension which appear at the limits of the portion\r\nof water in the direction of the current, are only the sums of the\r\ninduction and tension of the contiguous particles between those limits; and\r\nthe limitation of the inductive tension, to a certain degree shows (time\r\nentering in each case as an important element of the result), that when the\r\nparticles have acquired a certain relative state, _discharge_, or a\r\ntransfer of forces equivalent to ordinary conduction, takes place.\r\n\r\n1347. In the inductive condition assumed by water before discharge comes\r\non, the particles polarized are the particles of the _water_ that being the\r\ndielectric used[A]; but the discharge between particle and particle is not,\r\nas before, a mere interchange of their powers or forces at the polar parts,\r\nbut an actual separation of them into their two elementary particles, the\r\noxygen travelling in one direction, and carrying with it its amount of the\r\nforce it had acquired during the polarization, and the hydrogen doing the\r\nsame thing in the other direction, until they each meet the next\r\napproaching particle, which is in the same electrical state with that they\r\nhave left, and by association of their forces with it, produce what\r\nconstitutes discharge. This part of the action may be regarded as a\r\ncarrying one (1319. 1572. 1622.), performed by the constituent particles of\r\nthe dielectric. The latter is always a compound body (664. 823.); and by\r\nthose who have considered the subject and are acquainted with the\r\nphilosophical view of transfer which was first put forth by Grotthuss[B],\r\nits particles may easily be compared to a series of metallic conductors\r\nunder inductive action, which, whilst in that state, are divisible into\r\nthese elementary moveable halves.\r\n\r\n  [A] See 1699-1708.--_Dec. 1838_\r\n\r\n  [B] Annales de Chimie, lviii. 60. and lxiii, 20.\r\n\r\n1348. Electrolytic discharge depends, of necessity, upon the non-conduction\r\nof the dielectric as a whole, and there are two steps or acts in the\r\nprocess: first a polarization of the molecules of the substance and then a\r\nlowering of the forces by the separation, advance in opposite directions,\r\nand recombination of the elements of the molecules, these being, as it\r\nwere, the halves of the originally polarized conductors or particles.\r\n\r\n1349. These views of the decomposition of electrolytes and the consequent\r\neffect of discharge, which, as to the particular case, are the same with\r\nthose of Grotthuss (481.) and Davy (482.), though they differ from those of\r\nBiot (487.), De la Rive (490.), and others, seem to me to be fully in\r\naccordance not merely with the theory I have given of induction generally\r\n(1165.), but with all the known _facts_ of common induction, conduction,\r\nand electrolytic discharge; and in that respect help to confirm in my mind\r\nthe truth of the theory set forth. The new mode of discharge which\r\nelectrolyzation presents must surely be an evidence of the _action of\r\ncontiguous particles_; and as this appears to depend directly upon a\r\nprevious inductive state, which is the same with common induction, it\r\ngreatly strengthens the argument which refers induction in all cases to an\r\naction of contiguous particles also (1295, &c.).\r\n\r\n1350. As an illustration of the condition of the polarized particles in a\r\ndielectric under induction, I may describe an experiment. Put into a glass\r\nvessel some clear rectified oil of turpentine, and introduce two wires\r\npassing through glass tubes where they coincide with the surface of the\r\nfluid, and terminating either in balls or points. Cut some very clean dry\r\nwhite silk into small particles, and put these also into the liquid: then\r\nelectrify one of the wires by an ordinary machine and discharge by the\r\nother. The silk will immediately gather from all parts of the liquid, and\r\nform a band of particles reaching from wire to wire, and if touched by a\r\nglass rod will show considerable tenacity; yet the moment the supply of\r\nelectricity ceases, the band will fall away and disappear by the dispersion\r\nof its parts. The _conduction_ by the silk is in this case very small; and\r\nafter the best examination I could give to the effects, the impression on\r\nmy mind is, that the adhesion of the whole is due to the polarity which\r\neach filament acquires, exactly as the particles of iron between the poles\r\nof a horse-shoe magnet are held together in one mass by a similar\r\ndisposition of forces. The particles of silk therefore represent to me the\r\ncondition of the molecules of the dielectric itself, which I assume to be\r\npolar, just as that of the silk is. In all cases of conductive discharge\r\nthe contiguous polarized particles of the body are able to effect a\r\nneutralization of their forces with greater or less facility, as the silk\r\ndoes also in a very slight degree. Further we are not able to carry the\r\nparallel, except in imagination; but if we could divide each particle of\r\nsilk into two halves, and let each half travel until it met and united with\r\nthe next half in an opposite state, it would then exert its carrying power\r\n(1347.), and so far represent electrolytic discharge.\r\n\r\n1351. Admitting that electrolytic discharge is a consequence of previous\r\ninduction, then how evidently do its numerous cases point to induction in\r\ncurved lines (521. 1216.), and to the divergence or lateral action of the\r\nlines of inductive force (1231.), and so strengthen that part of the\r\ngeneral argument in the former paper! If two balls of platina, forming the\r\nelectrodes of a voltaic battery, are put into a large vessel of dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, the whole of the surfaces are covered with the respective\r\ngases in beautifully regulated proportions, and the mind has no difficulty\r\nin conceiving the direction of the curved lines of discharge, and even the\r\nintensity of force of the different lines, by the quantity of gas evolved\r\nupon the different parts of the surface. From this condition of the lines\r\nof inductive force arise the general effects of diffusion; the appearance\r\nof the anions or cathions round the edges and on the further side of the\r\nelectrodes when in the form of plates; and the manner in which the current\r\nor discharge will follow all the forms of the electrolyte, however\r\ncontorted. Hence, also, the effects which Nobili has so well examined and\r\ndescribed[A] in his papers on the distribution of currents in conducting\r\nmasses. All these effects indicate the curved direction of the currents or\r\ndischarges which occur in and through the dielectrics, and these are in\r\nevery case _preceded_ by equivalent inductive actions of the contiguous\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\n  [A] Bibliothèque Universelle, 1835, lix. 263. 416.\r\n\r\n1352. Hence also the advantage, when the exciting forces are weak or\r\nrequire assistance, of enlarging the mass of the electrolyte; of increasing\r\nthe size of the electrodes; of making the coppers surround the zincs:--all\r\nis in harmony with the view of induction which I am endeavouring to\r\nexamine; I do not perceive as yet one fact against it.\r\n\r\n1353. There are many points of _electrolytic discharge_ which ultimately\r\nwill require to be very closely considered, though I can but slightly touch\r\nupon them. It is not that, as far as I have investigated them, they present\r\nany contradiction to the view taken (for I have carefully, though\r\nunsuccessfully, sought for such cases), but simply want of time as yet to\r\npursue the inquiry, which prevents me from entering upon them here.\r\n\r\n1354. One point is, that different electrolytes or dielectrics require\r\ndifferent initial intensities for their decomposition (912.). This may\r\ndepend upon the degree of polarization which the particles require before\r\nelectrolytic discharge commences. It is in direct relation to the chemical\r\naffinity of the substances concerned; and will probably be found to have a\r\nrelation or analogy to the specific inductive capacity of different bodies\r\n(1252. 1296.). It thus promises to assist in causing the great truths of\r\nthose extensive sciences, which are occupied in considering the forces of\r\nthe particles of matter, to fall into much closer order and arrangement\r\nthan they have heretofore presented.\r\n\r\n1355. Another point is the facilitation of electrolytic conducting power or\r\ndischarge by the addition of substances to the dielectric employed. This\r\neffect is strikingly shown where water is the body whose qualities are\r\nimproved, but, as yet, no general law governing all the phenomena has been\r\ndetected. Thus some acids, as the sulphuric, phosphoric, oxalic, and\r\nnitric, increase the power of water enormously; whilst others, as the\r\ntartaric and citric acids, give but little power; and others, again, as the\r\nacetic and boracic acids, do not produce a change sensible to the\r\nvoltameter (739.). Ammonia produces no effect, but its carbonate does. The\r\ncaustic alkalies and their carbonates produce a fair effect. Sulphate of\r\nsoda, nitre (753.), and many soluble salts produce much effect. Percyanide\r\nof mercury and corrosive sublimate produce no effect; nor does iodine, gum,\r\nor sugar, the test being a voltameter. In many cases the added substance is\r\nacted on either directly or indirectly, and then the phenomena are more\r\ncomplicated; such substances are muriatic acid (758.), the soluble\r\nprotochlorides (766.), and iodides (769.), nitric acid (752.), &c. In other\r\ncases the substance added is not, when alone, subject to or a conductor of\r\nthe powers of the voltaic battery, and yet both gives and receives power\r\nwhen associated with water. M. de la Rive has pointed this result out in\r\nsulphurous acid[A], iodine and bromine[B]; the chloride of arsenic produces\r\nthe same effect. A far more striking case, however, is presented by that\r\nvery influential body sulphuric acid (681.): and probably phosphoric acid\r\nalso is in the same peculiar relation.\r\n\r\n  [A] Quarterly Journal, xxvii. 407. or Bibliothèque Universelle, xl.\r\n  205. Kemp says sulphurous acid is a very good conductor, Quarterly\r\n  Journal, 1831, p. 613.\r\n\r\n  [B] Quarterly Journal, xxiv, 465. or Annales de Chimie, xxxv. 161.\r\n\r\n1356. It would seem in the cases of those bodies which suffer no change\r\nthemselves, as sulphuric acid (and perhaps in all), that they affect water\r\nin its conducting power only as an electrolyte; for whether little or much\r\nimproved, the decomposition is proportionate to the quantity of electricity\r\npassing (727. 730.), and the transfer is therefore due to electrolytic\r\ndischarge. This is in accordance with the fact already stated as regards\r\nwater (984.), that the conducting power is not improved for electricity of\r\nforce below the electrolytic intensity of the substance acting as the\r\ndielectric; but both facts (and some others) are against the opinion which\r\nI formerly gave, that the power of salts, &c. might depend upon their\r\nassumption of the liquid state by solution in the water employed (410.). It\r\noccurs to me that the effect may perhaps be related to, and have its\r\nexplanation in differences of specific inductive capacities.\r\n\r\n1357. I have described in the last paper, cases, where shell-lac was\r\nrendered a conductor by absorption of ammonia (1294.). The same effect\r\nhappens with muriatic acid; yet both these substances, when gaseous, are\r\nnon-conductors; and the ammonia, also when in strong solution (718.). Mr.\r\nHarris has mentioned instances[A] in which the conducting power of metals\r\nis seriously altered by a very little alloy. These may have no relation to\r\nthe former cases, but nevertheless should not be overlooked in the general\r\ninvestigation which the whole question requires.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1827, p. 22.\r\n\r\n1358. Nothing is perhaps more striking in that class of dielectrics which\r\nwe call electrolytes, than the extraordinary and almost complete suspension\r\nof their peculiar mode of effecting discharge when they are rendered\r\n_solid_ (380, &c.), even though the intensity of the induction acting\r\nthrough them may be increased a hundredfold or more (419.). It not only\r\nestablishes a very general relation between the physical properties of\r\nthese bodies and electricity acting by induction through them, but draws\r\nboth their physical and chemical relations so near together, as to make us\r\nhope we shall shortly arrive at the full comprehension of the influence\r\nthey mutually possess over each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ ix. _Disruptive discharge and insulation._\r\n\r\n1359. The next form of discharge has been distinguished by the adjective\r\n_disruptive_ (1319.), as it in every case displaces more or less the\r\nparticles amongst and across which it suddenly breaks. I include under it,\r\ndischarge in the form of sparks, brushes, and glow (1405.), but exclude the\r\ncases of currents of air, fluids, &c., which, though frequently\r\naccompanying the former, are essentially distinct in their nature.\r\n\r\n1360. The conditions requisite for the production of an electric spark in\r\nits simplest form are well-known. An insulating dielectric must be\r\ninterposed between two conducting surfaces in opposite states of\r\nelectricity, and then if the actions be continually increased in strength,\r\nor otherwise favoured, either by exalting the electric state of the two\r\nconductors, or bringing them nearer to each other, or diminishing the\r\ndensity of the dielectric, a _spark_ at last appears, and the two forces\r\nare for the time annihilated, for _discharge_ has occurred.\r\n\r\n1361. The conductors (which may be considered as the termini of the\r\ninductive action) are in ordinary cases most generally metals, whilst the\r\ndielectrics usually employed are common air and glass. In my view of\r\ninduction, however, every dielectric becomes of importance, for as the\r\nresults are considered essentially dependent on these bodies, it was to be\r\nexpected that differences of action never before suspected would be evident\r\nupon close examination, and so at once give fresh confirmation of the\r\ntheory, and open new doors of discovery into the extensive and varied\r\nfields of our science. This hope was especially entertained with respect to\r\nthe gases, because of their high degree of insulation, their uniformity in\r\nphysical condition, and great difference in chemical properties.\r\n\r\n1362. All the effects prior to the discharge are inductive; and the degree\r\nof tension which it is necessary to attain before the spark passes is\r\ntherefore, in the examination I am now making of the new view of induction,\r\na very important point. It is the limit of the influence which the\r\ndielectric exerts in resisting discharge; it is a measure, consequently, of\r\nthe conservative power of the dielectric, which in its turn may be\r\nconsidered as becoming a measure, and therefore a representative of the\r\nintensity of the electric forces in activity.\r\n\r\n1363. Many philosophers have examined the circumstances of this limiting\r\naction in air, but, as far as I know, none have come near Mr. Harris as to\r\nthe accuracy with, and the extent to, which he has carried on his\r\ninvestigations[A]. Some of his results I must very briefly notice,\r\npremising that they are all obtained with the use of air as the\r\n_dielectric_ between the conducting surfaces.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 225.\r\n\r\n1364. First as to the _distance_ between the two balls used, or in other\r\nwords, the _thickness_ of the dielectric across which the induction was\r\nsustained. The quantity of electricity, measured by a unit jar, or\r\notherwise on the same principle with the unit jar, in the charged or\r\ninductive ball, necessary to produce spark discharge, was found to vary\r\nexactly with the distance between the balls, or between the discharging\r\npoints, and that under very varied and exact forms of experiment[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 225.\r\n\r\n1365. Then with respect to variation in the _pressure_ or _density_ of the\r\nair. The quantities of electricity required to produce discharge across a\r\n_constant_ interval varied exactly with variations of the density; the\r\nquantity of electricity and density of the air being in the same simple\r\nratio. Or, if the quantity was retained the same, whilst the interval and\r\ndensity of the air were varied, then these were found in the inverse simple\r\nratio of each other, the same quantity passing across twice the distance\r\nwith air rarefied to one-half[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p.229.\r\n\r\n1366. It must be remembered that these effects take place without any\r\nvariation of the _inductive_ force by condensation or rarefaction of the\r\nair. That force remains the same in air[A], and in all gases (1284. 1292.),\r\nwhatever their rarefaction may be.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 237, 244.\r\n\r\n1367. Variation of the _temperature_ of the air produced no variation of\r\nthe quantity of electricity required to cause discharge across a given\r\ninterval[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 230\r\n\r\nSuch are the general results, which I have occasion for at present,\r\nobtained by Mr. Harris, and they appear to me to be unexceptionable.\r\n\r\n1368. In the theory of induction founded upon a molecular action of the\r\ndielectric, we have to look to the state of that body principally for the\r\ncause and determination of the above effects. Whilst the induction\r\ncontinues, it is assumed that the particles of the dielectric are in a\r\ncertain polarized state, the tension of this state rising higher in each\r\nparticle as the induction is raised to a higher degree, either by\r\napproximation of the inducing surfaces, variation of form, increase of the\r\noriginal force, or other means; until at last, the tension of the particles\r\nhaving reached the utmost degree which they can sustain without subversion\r\nof the whole arrangement, discharge immediately after takes place.\r\n\r\n1369. The theory does not assume, however, that _all_ the particles of the\r\ndielectric subject to the inductive action are affected to the same amount,\r\nor acquire the same tension. What has been called the lateral action of the\r\nlines of inductive force (1231. 1297.), and the diverging and occasionally\r\ncurved form of these lines, is against such a notion. The idea is, that any\r\nsection taken through the dielectric across the lines of inductive force,\r\nand including _all of them,_ would be equal, in the sum of the forces, to\r\nthe sum of the forces in any other section; and that, therefore, the whole\r\namount of tension for each such section would be the same.\r\n\r\n1370. Discharge probably occurs, not when all the particles have attained\r\nto a certain degree of tension, but when that particle which is most\r\naffected has been exalted to the subverting or turning point (1410.). For\r\nthough _all_ the particles in the line of induction resist charge, and are\r\nassociated in their actions so as to give a sum of resisting force, yet\r\nwhen any one is brought up to the overturning point, _all_ must give way in\r\nthe case of a spark between ball and ball. The breaking down of that one\r\nmust of necessity cause the whole barrier to be overturned, for it was at\r\nits utmost degree of resistance when it possessed the aiding power of that\r\none particle, in addition to the power of the rest, and the power of that\r\none is now lost. Hence _tension_ or _intensity_[A] may, according to the\r\ntheory, be considered as represented by the particular condition of the\r\nparticles, or the amount in them of forced variation from their normal\r\nstate (1298. 1368.).\r\n\r\n  [A] See Harris on proposed particular meaning of these terms,\r\n  Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 222.\r\n\r\n1371. The whole effect produced by a charged conductor on a distant\r\nconductor, insulated or not, is by my theory assumed to be due to an action\r\npropagated from particle to particle of the intervening and insulating\r\ndielectric, all the particles being considered as thrown for the time into\r\na forced condition, from which they endeavour to return to their normal or\r\nnatural state. The theory, therefore, seems to supply an easy explanation\r\nof the influence of _distance_ in affecting induction (1303. 1364.). As the\r\ndistance is diminished induction increases; for there are then fewer\r\nparticles in the line of inductive force to oppose their united resistance\r\nto the assumption of the forced or polarized state, and _vice versa._\r\nAgain, as the distance diminishes, discharge across happens with a lower\r\ncharge of electricity; for if, as in Harris's experiments (1364), the\r\ninterval be diminished to one-half, then half the electricity required to\r\ndischarge across the first interval is sufficient to strike across the\r\nsecond; and it is evident, also, that at that time there are only half the\r\nnumber of interposed molecules uniting their forces to resist the\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n1372. The effect of enlarging the conducting surfaces which are opposed to\r\neach other in the act of induction, is, if the electricity be limited in\r\nits supply, to lower the intensity of action; and this follows as a very\r\nnatural consequence from the increased area of the dielectric across which\r\nthe induction is effected. For by diffusing the inductive action, which at\r\nfirst was exerted through one square inch of sectional area of the\r\ndielectric, over two or three square inches of such area, twice or three\r\ntimes the number of molecules of the dielectric are brought into the\r\npolarized condition, and employed in sustaining the inductive action, and\r\nconsequently the tension belonging to the smaller number on which the\r\nlimited force was originally accumulated, must fall in a proportionate\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n1373. For the same reason diminishing these opposing surfaces must increase\r\nthe intensity, and the effect will increase until the surfaces become\r\npoints. But in this case, the tension of the particles of the dielectric\r\nnext the points is higher than that of particles midway, because of the\r\nlateral action and consequent bulging, as it were, of the lines of\r\ninductive force at the middle distance (1369.).\r\n\r\n1374. The more exalted effects of induction on a point _p_, or any small\r\nsurface, as the rounded end of a rod, when it is opposed to a large\r\nsurface, as that of a ball or plate, rather than to another point or end,\r\nthe distance being in both cases the same, fall into harmonious relation\r\nwith my theory (1302.). For in the latter case, the small surface _p_ is\r\naffected only by those particles which are brought into the inductive\r\ncondition by the equally small surface of the opposed conductor, whereas\r\nwhen that is a ball or plate the lines of inductive force from the latter\r\nare concentrated, as it were, upon the end _p_. Now though the molecules of\r\nthe dielectric against the large surface may have a much lower state of\r\ntension than those against the corresponding smaller surface, yet they are\r\nalso far more numerous, and, as the lines of inductive force converge\r\ntowards a point, are able to communicate to the particles contained in any\r\ncross section (1369.) nearer the small surface an amount of tension equal\r\nto their own, and consequently much higher for each individual particle; so\r\nthat, at the surface of the smaller conductor, the tension of a particle\r\nrises much, and if that conductor were to terminate in a point, the tension\r\nwould rise to an infinite degree, except that it is limited, as before\r\n(1368.), by discharge. The nature of the discharge from small surfaces and\r\npoints under induction will be resumed hereafter (1425. &c.)\r\n\r\n1375. _Rarefaction_ of the air does not alter the _intensity_ of inductive\r\naction (1284. 1287.); nor is there any reason, as far as I can perceive,\r\nwhy it should. If the quantity of electricity and the distance remain the\r\nsame, and the air be rarefied one-half, then, though one-half of the\r\nparticles of the dielectric are removed, the other half assume a double\r\ndegree of tension in their polarity, and therefore the inductive forces are\r\nbalanced, and the result remains unaltered as long as the induction and\r\ninsulation are sustained. But the case of _discharge_ is very different;\r\nfor as there are only half the number of dielectric particles in the\r\nrarefied atmosphere, so these are brought up to the discharging intensity\r\nby half the former quantity of electricity; discharge, therefore, ensues,\r\nand such a consequence of the theory is in perfect accordance with Mr.\r\nHarris's results (1365.).\r\n\r\n1376. The _increase_ of electricity required to cause discharge over the\r\nsame distance, when the pressure of the air or its density is increased,\r\nflows in a similar manner, and on the same principle (1375.), from the\r\nmolecular theory.\r\n\r\n1377. Here I think my view of induction has a decided advantage over\r\nothers, especially over that which refers the retention of electricity on\r\nthe surface of conductors in air to the _pressure of the atmosphere_\r\n(1305.). The latter is the view which, being adopted by Poisson and\r\nBiot[A], is also, I believe, that generally received; and it associates two\r\nsuch dissimilar things, as the ponderous air and the subtile and even\r\nhypothetical fluid or fluids of electricity, by gross mechanical relations;\r\nby the bonds of mere static pressure. My theory, on the contrary, sets out\r\nat once by connecting the electric forces with the particles of matter; it\r\nderives all its proofs, and even its origin in the first instance, from\r\nexperiment; and then, without any further assumption, seems to offer at\r\nonce a full explanation of these and many other singular, peculiar, and, I\r\nthink, heretofore unconnected effects.\r\n\r\n  [A] Encyclopædia Britannica, Supplement, vol. iv. Article Electricity,\r\n  pp. 76, 81. &c.\r\n\r\n1378. An important assisting experimental argument may here be adduced,\r\nderived from the difference of specific inductive capacity of different\r\ndielectrics (1269. 1274. 1278.). Consider an insulated sphere electrified\r\npositively and placed in the centre of another and larger sphere\r\nuninsulated, a uniform dielectric, as air, intervening. The case is really\r\nthat of my apparatus (1187.), and also, in effect, that of any ball\r\nelectrified in a room and removed to some distance from irregularly-formed\r\nconductors. Whilst things remain in this state the electricity is\r\ndistributed (so to speak) uniformly over the surface of the electrified\r\nsphere. But introduce such a dielectric as sulphur or lac, into the space\r\nbetween the two conductors on one side only, or opposite one part of the\r\ninner sphere, and immediately the electricity on the latter is diffused\r\nunequally (1229. 1270. 1309.), although the form of the conducting\r\nsurfaces, their distances, and the _pressure_ of the atmosphere remain\r\nperfectly unchanged.\r\n\r\n1379. Fusinieri took a different view from that of Poisson, Biot, and\r\nothers, of the reason why rarefaction of air caused easy diffusion of\r\nelectricity. He considered the effect as due to the removal of the\r\n_obstacle_ which the air presented to the expansion of the substances from\r\nwhich the electricity passed[A]. But platina balls show the phenomena _in\r\nvacuo_ as well as volatile metals and other substances; besides which, when\r\nthe rarefaction is very considerable, the electricity passes with scarcely\r\nany resistance, and the production of no sensible heat; so that I think\r\nFusinieri's view of the matter is likely to gain but few assents.\r\n\r\n  [A] Bib. Univ. 1831, xlviii. 375.\r\n\r\n1380. I have no need to remark upon the discharging or collecting power of\r\nflame or hot air. I believe, with Harris, that the mere heat does nothing\r\n(1367.), the rarefaction only being influential. The effect of rarefaction\r\nhas been already considered generally (1375.); and that caused by the heat\r\nof a burning light, with the pointed form of the wick, and the carrying\r\npower of the carbonaceous particles which for the time are associated with\r\nit, are fully sufficient to account for all the effects.\r\n\r\n1381. We have now arrived at the important question, how will the inductive\r\ntension requisite for insulation and disruptive discharge be sustained in\r\ngases, which, having the same physical state and also the _same\r\npressure_ and the _same temperature_ as _air_, differ from it in specific\r\ngravity, in chemical qualities, and it may be in peculiar relations, which\r\nnot being as yet recognized, are purely electrical (1361.)?\r\n\r\n1382. Into this question I can enter now only as far as is essential for\r\nthe present argument, namely, that insulation and inductive tension do not\r\ndepend merely upon the charged conductors employed, but also, and\r\nessentially, upon the interposed dielectric, in consequence of the\r\nmolecular action of its particles (1292.).\r\n\r\n1383. A glass vessel _a_ (fig. 127.)[A] was ground at the top and bottom so\r\nas to be closed by two ground brass plates, _b_ and _c_; _b_ carried a\r\nstuffing-box, with a sliding rod _d_ terminated by a brass ball _s_ below,\r\nand a ring above. The lower plate was connected with a foot, stop-cock, and\r\nsocket, _e_, _f_ and _g_; and also with a brass ball _l_, which by means of\r\na stem attached to it and entering the socket _g_, could be fixed at\r\nvarious heights. The metallic parts of this apparatus were not varnished,\r\nbut the glass was well-covered with a coat of shell-lac previously\r\ndissolved in alcohol. On exhausting the vessel at the air-pump it could be\r\nfilled with any other gas than air, and, in such cases, the gas so passed\r\nin was dried whilst entering by fused chloride of calcium.\r\n\r\n  [A] The drawing is to a scale of 1/6.\r\n\r\n1384. The other part of the apparatus consisted of two insulating pillars,\r\n_h_ and _i_, to which were fixed two brass balls, and through these passed\r\ntwo sliding rods, _k_ and _m_, terminated at each end by brass balls; _n_\r\nis the end of an insulated conductor, which could be rendered either\r\npositive or negative from an electrical machine; _o_ and _p_ are wires\r\nconnecting it with the two parts previously described, and _q_ is a wire\r\nwhich, connecting the two opposite sides of the collateral arrangements,\r\nalso communicates with a good discharging train _r_ (292.).\r\n\r\n1385. It is evident that the discharge from the machine electricity may\r\npass either between _s_ and _l_, or S and L. The regulation adopted in the\r\nfirst experiments was to keep _s_ and _l_ with their distance _unchanged_,\r\nbut to introduce first one gas and then another into the vessel _a_, and\r\nthen balance the discharge at the one place against that at the other; for\r\nby making the interval at _a_ sufficiently small, all the discharge would\r\npass there, or making it sufficiently large it would all occur at the\r\ninterval _v_ in the receiver. On principle it seemed evident, that in this\r\nway the varying interval _u_ might be taken as a measure, or rather\r\nindication of the resistance to discharge through the gas at the constant\r\ninterval _v_. The following are the constant dimensions.\r\n\r\n  Ball _s_        0.93 of an inch.\r\n  Ball S          0.96 of an inch.\r\n  Ball _l_        2.02 of an inch.\r\n  Ball L          0.62 of an inch.\r\n  Interval _v_    0.62 of an inch.\r\n\r\n1386. On proceeding to experiment it was found that when air or any gas was\r\nin the receiver _a_, the interval _u_ was not a fixed one; it might be\r\naltered through a certain range of distance, and yet sparks pass either\r\nthere or at _v_ in the receiver. The extremes were therefore noted, i.e.\r\nthe greatest distance short of that at which the discharge _always_ took\r\nplace at _v_ in the gas, and the least distance short of that at which it\r\n_always_ took place at _u_ in the air. Thus, with air in the receiver, the\r\nextremes at _u_ were 0.56 and 0.79 of an inch, the range of 0.23 between\r\nthese distances including intervals at which sparks passed occasionally\r\neither at one place or the other.\r\n\r\n1387. The small balls _s_ and S could be rendered either positive or\r\nnegative from the machine, and as gases were expected and were found to\r\ndiffer from each other in relation to this change (1399.), the results\r\nobtained under these differences of charge were also noted.\r\n\r\n1388. The following is a Table of results; the gas named is that in the\r\nvessel _a_.

One would have expected only two distances, one for each interval,\r\nfor which the discharge might happen either at one or the other; and that\r\nthe least alteration of either would immediately cause one to predominate\r\nconstantly over the other. But that under common circumstances is not the\r\ncase. With air in the receiver, the variation amounted to 0.2 of an inch\r\nnearly on the smaller interval of 0.6, and with muriatic acid gas, the\r\nvariation was above 0.4 on the smaller interval of 0.9. Why is it that when\r\na fixed interval (the one in the receiver) will pass a spark that cannot go\r\nacross 0.6 of air at one time, it will immediately after, and apparently\r\nunder exactly similar circumstances, not pass a spark that can go across\r\n0.8 of air?\r\n\r\n1391. It is probable that part of this variation will be traced to\r\nparticles of dust in the air drawn into and about the circuit (1568.). I\r\nbelieve also that part depends upon a variable charged condition of the\r\nsurface of the glass vessel _a_. That the whole of the effect is not\r\ntraceable to the influence of circumstances in the vessel _a_, may be\r\ndeduced from the fact, that when sparks occur between balls in free air\r\nthey frequently are not straight, and often pass otherwise than by the\r\nshortest distance. These variations in air itself, and at different parts\r\nof the very same balls, show the presence and influence of circumstances\r\nwhich are calculated to produce effects of the kind now under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n1392. When a spark had passed at either interval, then, generally, more\r\ntended to appear at the _same_ interval, as if a preparation had been made\r\nfor the passing of the latter sparks. So also on continuing to work the\r\nmachine quickly the sparks generally followed at the same place. This\r\neffect is probably due in part to the warmth of the air heated by the\r\npreceding spark, in part to dust, and I suspect in part, to something\r\nunperceived as yet in the circumstances of discharge.\r\n\r\n1393. A very remarkable difference, which is _constant_ in its direction,\r\noccurs when the electricity communicated to the balls _s_ and S is changed\r\nfrom positive to negative, or in the contrary direction. It is that the\r\nrange of variation is always greater when the small bulls are positive than\r\nwhen they are negative. This is exhibited in the following Table, drawn\r\nfrom the former experiments.\r\n\r\n                           Pos.      Neg.\r\nIn Air the range was       0.19      0.09\r\n   Oxygen                  0.19      0.02\r\n   Nitrogen                0.18      0.11\r\n   Hydrogen                0.14      0.05\r\n   Carbonic acid           0.16      0.02\r\n   Olefiant gas            0.22      0.08\r\n   Coal gas                0.24      0.12\r\n   Muriatic acid           0.43      0.08\r\n\r\nI have no doubt these numbers require considerable correction, but the\r\ngeneral result is striking, and the differences in several cases very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1394. Though, in consequence of the variation of the striking distance\r\n(1386.), the interval in air fails to be a measure, as yet, of the\r\ninsulating or resisting power of the gas in the vessel, yet we may for\r\npresent purposes take the mean interval as representing in some degree that\r\npower. On examining these mean intervals as they are given in the third\r\ncolumn (1388.), it will be very evident, that gases, when employed as\r\ndielectrics, have peculiar electrical relations to insulation, and\r\ntherefore to induction, very distinct from such as might be supposed to\r\ndepend upon their mere physical qualities of specific gravity or pressure.\r\n\r\n1395. First, it is clear that at the _same pressure_ they are not alike,\r\nthe difference being as great as 37 and 110. When the small balls are\r\ncharged positively, and with the same surfaces and the same pressure,\r\nmuriatic acid gas has three times the insulating or restraining power\r\n(1362.) of hydrogen gas, and nearly twice that of oxygen, nitrogen, or air.\r\n\r\n1396. Yet it is evident that the difference is not due to specific gravity,\r\nfor though hydrogen is the lowest, and therefore lower than oxygen, oxygen\r\nis much beneath nitrogen, or olefiant gas; and carbonic acid gas, though\r\nconsiderably heavier than olefiant gas or muriatic acid gas, is lower than\r\neither. Oxygen as a heavy, and olefiant as a light gas, are in strong\r\ncontrast with each other; and if we may reason of olefiant gas from\r\nHarris's results with air (1365.), then it might be rarefied to two-thirds\r\nits usual density, or to a specific gravity of 9.3 (hydrogen being 1), and\r\nhaving neither the same density nor pressure as oxygen, would have equal\r\ninsulating powers with it, or equal tendency to resist discharge.\r\n\r\n1397. Experiments have already been described (1291. 1292.) which show that\r\nthe gases are sensibly alike in their inductive capacity. This result is\r\nnot in contradiction with the existence of great differences in their\r\nrestraining power. The same point has been observed already in regard to\r\ndense and rare air (1375.).\r\n\r\n1398. Hence arises a new argument proving that it cannot be mere pressure\r\nof the atmosphere which prevents or governs discharge (1377. 1378.), but a\r\nspecific electric quality or relation of the gaseous medium. Hence also\r\nadditional argument for the theory of molecular inductive action.\r\n\r\n1399. Other specific differences amongst the gases may be drawn from the\r\npreceding series of experiments, rough and hasty as they are. Thus the\r\npositive and negative series of mean intervals do not give the same\r\ndifferences. It has been already noticed that the negative numbers are\r\nlower than the positive (1393.), but, besides that, the _order_ of the\r\npositive and negative results is not the same. Thus, on comparing the mean\r\nnumbers (which represent for the present insulating tension,) it appears\r\nthat in air, hydrogen, carbonic acid, olefiant gas and muriatic acid, the\r\ntension rose higher when the smaller ball was made positive than when\r\nrendered negative, whilst in oxygen, nitrogen, and coal gas, the reverse\r\nwas the case. Now though the numbers cannot be trusted as exact, and though\r\nair, oxygen, and nitrogen should probably be on the same side, yet some of\r\nthe results, as, for instance, those with muriatic acid, fully show a\r\npeculiar relation and difference amongst gases in this respect. This was\r\nfurther proved by making the interval in air 0.8 of an inch whilst muriatic\r\nacid gas was in the vessel _a_; for on charging the small balls _s_ and S\r\npositively, _all_ the discharge took place through the _air_; but on\r\ncharging them negatively, _all_ the discharge took place through the\r\n_muriatic acid gas_.\r\n\r\n1400. So also, when the conductor _n_ was connected _only_ with the\r\nmuriatic acid gas apparatus, it was found that the discharge was more\r\nfacile when the small ball _s_ was negative than when positive; for in the\r\nlatter case, much of the electricity passed off as brush discharge through\r\nthe air from the connecting wire _p_ but in the former case, it all seemed\r\nto go through the muriatic acid.\r\n\r\n1401. The consideration, however, of positive and negative discharge across\r\nair and other gases will be resumed in the further part of this, or in the\r\nnext paper (1465. 1525.).\r\n\r\n1402. Here for the present I must leave this part of the subject, which had\r\nfor its object only to observe how far gases agreed or differed as to their\r\npower of retaining a charge on bodies acting by induction through them. All\r\nthe results conspire to show that Induction is an action of contiguous\r\nmolecules (1295. &c.); but besides confirming this, the first principle\r\nplaced for proof in the present inquiry, they greatly assist in developing\r\nthe specific properties of each gaseous dielectric, at the same time\r\nshowing that further and extensive experimental investigation is necessary,\r\nand holding out the promise of new discovery as the reward of the labour\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1403. When we pass from the consideration of dielectrics like the gases to\r\nthat of bodies having the liquid and solid condition, then our reasonings\r\nin the present state of the subject assume much more of the character of\r\nmere supposition. Still I do not perceive anything adverse to the theory,\r\nin the phenomena which such bodies present. If we take three insulating\r\ndielectrics, as air, oil of turpentine, and shell-lac, and use the same\r\nballs or conductors at the same intervals in these three substances,\r\nincreasing the intensity of the induction until discharge take place, we\r\nshall find that it must be raised much higher in the fluid than for the\r\ngas, and higher still in the solid than for the fluid. Nor is this\r\ninconsistent with the theory; for with the liquid, though its molecules are\r\nfree to move almost as easily as those of the gas, there are many more\r\nparticles introduced into the given interval; and such is also the case\r\nwhen the solid body is employed. Besides that with the solid, the cohesive\r\nforce of the body used will produce some effect; for though the production\r\nof the polarized states in the particle of a solid may not be obstructed,\r\nbut, on the contrary, may in some cases be even favoured (1164. 1344.) by\r\nits solidity or other circumstances, yet solidity may well exert an\r\ninfluence on the point of final subversion, (just as it prevents discharge\r\nin an electrolyte,) and so enable inductive intensity to rise to a much\r\nhigher degree.\r\n\r\n1404. In the cases of solids and liquids too, bodies may, and most probably\r\ndo, possess specific differences as to their ability of assuming the\r\npolarized state, and also as to the extent to which that polarity must rise\r\nbefore discharge occurs. An analogous difference exists in the specific\r\ninductive capacities already pointed out in a few substances (1278.) in the\r\nlast paper. Such a difference might even account for the various degrees of\r\ninsulating and conducting power possessed by different bodies, and, if it\r\nshould be found to exist, would add further strength to the argument in\r\nfavour of the molecular theory of inductive action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1405. Having considered these various cases of sustained insulation in\r\nnon-conducting dielectrics up to the highest point which they can attain,\r\nwe find that they terminate at last in _disruptive discharge_; the peculiar\r\ncondition of the molecules of the dielectric which was necessary to the\r\ncontinuous induction, being equally essential to the occurrence of that\r\neffect which closes all the phenomena. This discharge is not only in its\r\nappearance and condition different to the former modes by which the\r\nlowering of the powers was effected (1320. 1343.), but, whilst really the\r\nsame in principle, varies much from itself in certain characters, and thus\r\npresents us with the forms of _spark_, _brush_, and _glow_ (1359.). I will\r\nfirst consider _the spark_, limiting it for the present to the case of\r\ndischarge between two oppositely electrified conducting surfaces.\r\n\r\n_The electric spark or flash._\r\n\r\n1406. The _spark_ is consequent upon a discharge or lowering of the\r\npolarized inductive state of many dielectric particles, by a particular\r\naction of a few of the particles occupying a very small and limited space;\r\nall the previously polarized particles returning to their first or normal\r\ncondition in the inverse order in which they left it, and uniting their\r\npowers meanwhile to produce, or rather to continue, (1417.--1436.) the\r\ndischarge effect in the place where the subversion of force first occurred.\r\nMy impression is, that the few particles situated where discharge occurs\r\nare not merely pushed apart, but assume a peculiar state, a highly exulted\r\ncondition for the time, i.e. have thrown upon them all the surrounding\r\nforces in succession, and rising up to a proportionate intensity of\r\ncondition, perhaps equal to that of chemically combining atoms, discharge\r\nthe powers, possibly in the same manner as they do theirs, by some\r\noperation at present unknown to us; and so the end of the whole. The\r\nultimate effect is exactly as if a metallic wire had been put into the\r\nplace of the discharging particles; and it does not seem impossible that\r\nthe principles of action in both cases, may, hereafter, prove to be the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n1407. The _path of the spark_, or of the discharge, depends on the degree\r\nof tension acquired by the particles in the line of discharge,\r\ncircumstances, which in every common case are very evident and by the\r\ntheory easy to understand, rendering it higher in them than in their\r\nneighbours, and, by exalting them first to the requisite condition, causing\r\nthem to determine the course of the discharge. Hence the selection of the\r\npath, and the solution of the wonder which Harris has so well described[A]\r\nas existing under the old theory. All is prepared amongst the molecules\r\nbeforehand, by the prior induction, for the path either of the electric\r\nspark or of lightning itself.\r\n\r\n  [A] Nautical Magazine, 1834, p 229.\r\n\r\n1408. The same difficulty is expressed as a principle by Nobili for voltaic\r\nelectricity, almost in Mr. Harris's words, namely[A], \"electricity directs\r\nitself towards the point where it can most easily discharge itself,\" and\r\nthe results of this as a principle he has well wrought out for the case of\r\nvoltaic currents. But the _solution_ of the difficulty, or the proximate\r\ncause of the effects, is the same; induction brings the particles up to or\r\ntowards a certain degree of tension (1370.); and by those which first\r\nattain it, is the discharge first and most efficiently performed.\r\n\r\n  [A] Bibliothèque Universelle, 1835, lix. 275.\r\n\r\n1409. The _moment_ of discharge is probably determined by that molecule of\r\nthe dielectric which, from the circumstances, has its tension most quickly\r\nraised up to the maximum intensity. In all cases where the discharge passes\r\nfrom conductor to conductor this molecule must be on the surface of one of\r\nthem; but when it passes between a conductor and a nonconductor, it is,\r\nperhaps, not always so (1453.). When this particle has acquired its maximum\r\ntension, then the whole barrier of resistance is broken down in the line or\r\nlines of inductive action originating at it, and disruptive discharge\r\noccurs (1370.): and such an inference, drawn as it is from the theory,\r\nseems to me in accordance with Mr. Harris's facts and conclusions\r\nrespecting the resistance of the atmosphere, namely, that it is not really\r\ngreater at any one discharging distance than another[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, pp. 227, 229.\r\n\r\n1410. It seems probable, that the tension of a particle of the same\r\ndielectric, as air, which is requisite to produce discharge, is a _constant\r\nquantity_, whatever the shape of the part of the conductor with which it is\r\nin contact, whether ball or point; whatever the thickness or depth of\r\ndielectric throughout which induction is exerted; perhaps, even, whatever\r\nthe state, as to rarefaction or condensation of the dielectric; and\r\nwhatever the nature of the conductor, good or bad, with which the particle\r\nis for the moment associated. In saying so much, I do not mean to exclude\r\nsmall differences which may be caused by the reaction of neighbouring\r\nparticles on the deciding particle, and indeed, it is evident that the\r\nintensity required in a particle must be related to the condition of those\r\nwhich are contiguous. But if the expectation should be found to approximate\r\nto truth, what a generality of character it presents! and, in the\r\ndefiniteness of the power possessed by a particular molecule, may we not\r\nhope to find an immediate relation to the force which, being electrical, is\r\nequally definite and constitutes chemical affinity?\r\n\r\n1411. Theoretically it would seem that, at the moment of discharge by the\r\nspark in one line of inductive force, not merely would all the other lines\r\nthrow their forces into this one (1406.), but the lateral effect,\r\nequivalent to a repulsion of these lines (1224. 1297.), would be relieved\r\nand, perhaps, followed by a contrary action, amounting to a collapse or\r\nattraction of these parts. Having long sought for some transverse force in\r\nstatical electricity, which should be the equivalent to magnetism or the\r\ntransverse force of current electricity, and conceiving that it might be\r\nconnected with the transverse action of the lines of inductive force,\r\nalready described (1297.), I was desirous, by various experiments, of\r\nbringing out the effect of such a force, and making it tell upon the\r\nphenomena of electro-magnetism and magneto-electricity[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See further investigations of this subject, 1658-1666.\r\n  1709-1735.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1412. Amongst other results, I expected and sought for the mutual\r\naffection, or even the lateral coalition of two similar sparks, if they\r\ncould be obtained simultaneously side by side, and sufficiently near to\r\neach other. For this purpose, two similar Leyden jars were supplied with\r\nrods of copper projecting from their balls in a horizontal direction, the\r\nrods being about 0.2 of an inch thick, and rounded at the ends. The jars\r\nwere placed upon a sheet of tinfoil, and so adjusted that their rods, _a_\r\nand _b_, were near together, in the position represented in plan at fig.\r\n116: _c_ and _d_ were two brass balls connected by a brass rod and\r\ninsulated: _e_ was also a brass ball connected, by a wire, with the ground\r\nand with the tinfoil upon which the Leyden jars were placed. By laying an\r\ninsulated metal rod across from _a_ to _b_, charging the jars, and removing\r\nthe rod, both the jars could be brought up to the same intensity of charge\r\n(1370.). Then, making the ball _e_ approach the ball _d_, at the moment the\r\nspark passed there, two sparks passed between the rods _n_, _o_, and the\r\nball _c_; and as far as the eye could judge, or the conditions determine,\r\nthey were simultaneous.\r\n\r\n1413. Under these circumstances two modes of discharge took place; either\r\neach end had its own particular spark to the ball, or else one end only was\r\nassociated by a spark with the ball, but was at the same time related to\r\nthe other end by a spark between the two.\r\n\r\n1414. When the ball _c_ was about an inch in diameter, the ends _n_ and\r\n_o_, about half an inch from it, and about 0.4 of an inch from each other,\r\nthe two sparks to the ball could be obtained. When for the purpose of\r\nbringing the sparks nearer together, the ends, _n_ and _o_, were brought\r\ncloser to each other, then, unless very carefully adjusted, only one end\r\nhad a spark with the ball, the other having a spark to it; and the least\r\nvariation of position would cause either _n_ or _o_ to be the end which,\r\ngiving the direct spark to the ball, was also the one through, or by means\r\nof which, the other discharged its electricity.\r\n\r\n1415. On making the ball _c_ smaller, I found that then it was needful to\r\nmake the interval between the ends _n_ and _o_ larger in proportion to the\r\ndistance between them and the ball _c_. On making _c_ larger, I found I\r\ncould diminish the interval, and so bring the two simultaneous separate\r\nsparks closer together, until, at last, the distance between them was not\r\nmore at the widest part than 0.6 of their whole length.\r\n\r\n1416. Numerous sparks were then passed and carefully observed. They were\r\nvery rarely straight, but either curved or bent irregularly. In the average\r\nof cases they were, I think, decidedly convex towards each other; perhaps\r\ntwo-thirds presented more or less of this effect, the rest bulging more or\r\nless outwards. I was never able, however, to obtain sparks which,\r\nseparately leaving the ends of the wires _n_ and _o_, conjoined into one\r\nspark before they reached or communicated with the ball _c_. At present,\r\ntherefore, though I think I saw a tendency in the sparks to unite, I cannot\r\nassert it as a fact.\r\n\r\n1417. But there is one very interesting effect here, analogous to, and it\r\nmay be in part the same with, that I was searching for: I mean the\r\nincreased facility of discharge where the spark passes. For instance, in\r\nthe cases where one end, as _n_, discharged the electricity of both ends to\r\nthe ball _c_, fig. 116, the electricity of the other end _o_, had to pass\r\nthrough an interval of air 1.5 times as great as that which it might have\r\ntaken, by its direct passage between the end and the ball itself. In such\r\ncases, the eye could not distinguish, even by the use of Wheatstone's\r\nmeans[A], that the spark from the end _n_, which contained both portions of\r\nelectricity, was a double spark. It could not have consisted of two sparks\r\ntaking separate courses, for such an effect would have been visible to the\r\neye; but it is just possible, that the spark of the first end _n_ and its\r\njar, passing at the smallest interval of time before that of the other _o_\r\nhad heated and expanded the air in its course, and made it so much more\r\nfavourable to discharge, that the electricity of the end _o_ preferred\r\nleaping across to it and taking a very circuitous route, rather than the\r\nmore direct one to the ball. It must, however, be remarked, in answer to\r\nthis supposition, that the one spark between _d_ and _e_ would, by its\r\ninfluence, tend to produce simultaneous discharges at _n_ and _o_, and\r\ncertainly did so, when no preponderance was given to one wire over the\r\nother, as to the previous inductive effect (1414.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, pp. 584, 585.\r\n\r\n1418. The fact, however, is, that disruptive discharge is favourable to\r\nitself. It is at the outset a case of tottering equilibrium: and if _time_\r\nbe an element in discharge, in however minute a proportion (1436.), then\r\nthe commencement of the act at any point favours its continuance and\r\nincrease there, and portions of power will be discharged by a course which\r\nthey would not otherwise have taken.\r\n\r\n1419. The mere heating and expansion of the air itself by the first portion\r\nof electricity which passes, must have a great influence in producing this\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n1420. As to the result itself, we see its effect in every electric spark;\r\nfor it is not the whole quantity which passes that determines the\r\ndischarge, but merely that small portion of force which brings the deciding\r\nmolecule (1370.) up to its maximum tension; then, when its forces are\r\nsubverted and discharge begins, all the rest passes by the same course,\r\nfrom the influence of the favouring circumstances just referred to; and\r\nwhether it be the electricity on a square inch, or a thousand square inches\r\nof charged glass, the discharge is complete. Hereafter we shall find the\r\ninfluence of this effect in the formation of brushes (1435.); and it is not\r\nimpossible that we may trace it producing the jagged spark and the forked\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1421. The characters of the electric spark in _different gases_ vary, and\r\nthe variation _may_ be due simply to the effect of the heat evolved at the\r\nmoment. But it may also be due to that specific relation of the particles\r\nand the electric forces which I have assumed as the basis of a theory of\r\ninduction; the facts do not oppose such a view; and in that view the\r\nvariation strengthens the argument for molecular action, as it would seem\r\nto show the influence of the latter in every part of the electrical effect\r\n(1423. 1454.).\r\n\r\n1422. The appearances of the sparks in different gases have often been\r\nobserved and recorded[A], but I think it not out of place to notice briefly\r\nthe following results; they were obtained with balls of brass, (platina\r\nsurfaces would have been better,) and at common pressures. In _air_, the\r\nsparks have that intense light and bluish colour which are so well known,\r\nand often have faint or dark parts in their course, when the quantity of\r\nelectricity passing is not great. In _nitrogen_, they are very beautiful,\r\nhaving the same general appearance as in air, but have decidedly more\r\ncolour of a bluish or purple character, and I thought were remarkably\r\nsonorous. In _oxygen_, the sparks were whiter than in air or nitrogen, and\r\nI think not so brilliant. In _hydrogen_, they had a very fine crimson\r\ncolour, not due to its rarity, for the character passed away as the\r\natmosphere was rarefied (1459.)[B]. Very little sound was produced in this\r\ngas; but that is a consequence of its physical condition[C]. In _carbonic\r\nacid gas_, the colour was similar to that of the spark in air, but with a\r\nlittle green in it: the sparks were remarkably irregular in form, more so\r\nthan in common air: they could also, under similar circumstances as to size\r\nof ball, &c., be obtained much longer than in air, the gas showing a\r\nsingular readiness to cause the discharge in the form of spark. In\r\n_muriatic acid gas_, the spark was nearly white: it was always bright\r\nthroughout, never presenting those dark parts which happen in air,\r\nnitrogen, and some other gases. The gas was dry, and during the whole\r\nexperiment the surface of the glass globe within remained quite dry and\r\nbright. In _coal gas_, the spark was sometimes green, sometimes red, and\r\noccasionally one part was green and another red: black parts also occur\r\nvery suddenly in the line of the spark, i.e. they are not connected by any\r\ndull part with bright portions, but the two seem to join directly one with\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n  [A] See Van Marum's description of the Teylerian machine, vol. i. p.\r\n  112, and vol. ii. p. 196; also Ency. Britan., vol. vi., Article\r\n  Electricity, pp. 505, 507.\r\n\r\n  [B] Van Marum says they are about four times as large in hydrogen as\r\n  in air. vol. i. p. 122.\r\n\r\n  [C] Leslie. Cambridge Phil. Transactions, 267.\r\n\r\n1423. These varieties of character impress my mind with a feeling, that\r\nthey are due to a direct relation of the electric powers to the particles\r\nof the dielectric through which the discharge occurs, and are not the mere\r\nresults of a casual ignition or a secondary kind of action of the\r\nelectricity, upon the particles which it finds in its course and thrusts\r\naside in its passage (1454.).\r\n\r\n1424. The spark may be obtained in media which are far denser than air, as\r\nin oil of turpentine, olive oil, resin, glass, &c.: it may also be obtained\r\nin bodies which being denser likewise approximate to the condition of\r\nconductors, as spermaceti, water, &c. But in these cases, nothing occurs\r\nwhich, as far as I can perceive, is at all hostile to the general views I\r\nhave endeavoured to advocate.\r\n\r\n_The electrical brush._\r\n\r\n1425. The _brush_ is the next form of disruptive discharge which I shall\r\nconsider. There are many ways of obtaining it, or rather of exalting its\r\ncharacters; and all these ways illustrate the principles upon which it is\r\nproduced. If an insulated conductor, connected with the positive conductor\r\nof an electrical machine, have a metal rod 0.3 of an inch in diameter\r\nprojecting from it outwards from the machine, and terminating by a rounded\r\nend or a small ball, it will generally give good brushes; or, if the\r\nmachine be not in good action, then many ways of assisting the formation of\r\nthe brush can be resorted to; thus, the hand or any _large_ conducting\r\nsurface may be approached towards the termination to increase inductive\r\nforce (1374.): or the termination may be smaller and of badly conducting\r\nmatter, as wood: or sparks may be taken between the prime conductor of the\r\nmachine and the secondary conductor to which the termination giving brushes\r\nbelongs: or, which gives to the brushes exceedingly fine characters and\r\ngreat magnitude, the air around the termination may be rarefied more or\r\nless, either by heat or the air-pump; the former favourable circumstances\r\nbeing also continued.\r\n\r\n1426. The brush when obtained by a powerful machine on a ball about 0.7 of\r\nan inch in diameter, at the end of a long brass rod attached to the\r\npositive prime conductor, had the general appearance as to form represented\r\nin fig. 117: a short conical bright part or root appeared at the middle\r\npart of the ball projecting directly from it, which, at a little distance\r\nfrom the ball, broke out suddenly into a wide brush of pale ramifications\r\nhaving a quivering motion, and being accompanied at the same time with a\r\nlow dull chattering sound.\r\n\r\n1427. At first the brush seems continuous, but Professor Wheatstone has\r\nshown that the whole phenomenon consists of successive intermitting\r\ndischarges[A]. If the eye be passed rapidly, not by a motion of the head,\r\nbut of the eyeball itself, across the direction of the brush, by first\r\nlooking steadfastly about 10° or 15° above, and then instantly as much\r\nbelow it, the general brush will be resolved into a number of individual\r\nbrushes, standing in a row upon the line which the eye passed over; each\r\nelementary brush being the result of a single discharge, and the space\r\nbetween them representing both the time during which the eye was passing\r\nover that space, and that which elapsed between one discharge and another.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 586.\r\n\r\n1428. The single brushes could easily be separated to eight or ten times\r\ntheir own width, but were not at the same time extended, i.e. they did not\r\nbecome more indefinite in shape, but, on the contrary, less so, each being\r\nmore distinct in form, ramification, and character, because of its\r\nseparation from the others, in its effects upon the eye. Each, therefore,\r\nwas instantaneous in its existence (1436.). Each had the conical root\r\ncomplete (1426.).\r\n\r\n1429. On using a smaller ball, the general brush was smaller, and the\r\nsound, though weaker, more continuous. On resolving the brush into its\r\nelementary parts, as before, these were found to occur at much shorter\r\nintervals of time than in the former case, but still the discharge was\r\nintermitting.\r\n\r\n1430. Employing a wire with a round end, the brush was still smaller, but,\r\nas before, separable into successive discharges. The sound, though feebler,\r\nwas higher in pitch, being a distinct musical note.\r\n\r\n1431. The sound is, in fact, due to the recurrence of the noise of each\r\nseparate discharge, and these, happening at intervals nearly equal under\r\nordinary circumstances, cause a definite note to be heard, which, rising in\r\npitch with the increased rapidity and regularity of the intermitting\r\ndischarges, gives a ready and accurate measure of the intervals, and so may\r\nbe used in any case when the discharge is heard, even though the\r\nappearances may not be seen, to determine the element of _time_. So when,\r\nby bringing the hand towards a projecting rod or ball, the pitch of the\r\ntone produced by a brushy discharge increases, the effect informs us that\r\nwe have increased the induction (1374.), and by that means increased the\r\nrapidity of the alternations of charge and discharge.\r\n\r\n1432. By using wires with finer terminations, smaller brushes were\r\nobtained, until they could hardly be distinguished as brushes; but as long\r\nas _sound_ was heard, the discharge could be ascertained by the eye to be\r\nintermitting; and when the sound ceased, the light became _continuous_ as a\r\nglow (1359. 1405. 1526-1543.).\r\n\r\n1433. To those not accustomed to use the eye in the manner I have\r\ndescribed, or, in cases where the recurrence is too quick for any\r\nunassisted eye, the beautiful revolving mirror of Professor Wheatstone[A]\r\nwill be useful for such developments of condition as those mentioned above.\r\nAnother excellent process is to produce the brush or other luminous\r\nphenomenon on the end of a rod held in the hand opposite to a charged\r\npositive or negative conductor, and then move the rod rapidly from side to\r\nside whilst the eye remains still. The successive discharges occur of\r\ncourse in different places, and the state of things before, at, and after a\r\nsingle coruscation or brush can be exceedingly well separated.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, pp. 581, 585.\r\n\r\n1434. The _brush_ is in reality a discharge between a bad or a\r\nnon-conductor and either a conductor or another non-conductor. Under common\r\ncircumstances, the brush is a discharge between a conductor and air, and I\r\nconceive it to take place in something like the following manner. When the\r\nend of an electrified rod projects into the middle of a room, induction\r\ntakes place between it and the walls of the room, across the dielectric,\r\nair; and the lines of inductive force accumulate upon the end in greater\r\nquantity than elsewhere, or the particles of air at the end of the rod are\r\nmore highly polarized than those at any other part of the rod, for the\r\nreasons already given (1374.). The particles of air situated in sections\r\nacross these lines of force are least polarized in the sections towards the\r\nwalls and most polarized in those nearer to the end of the wires (1369.):\r\nthus, it may well happen, that a particle at the end of the wire is at a\r\ntension that will immediately terminate in discharge, whilst in those even\r\nonly a few inches off, the tension is still beneath that point. But suppose\r\nthe rod to be charged positively, a particle of air A, fig. 118, next it,\r\nbeing polarized, and having of course its negative force directed towards\r\nthe rod and its positive force outwards; the instant that discharge takes\r\nplace between the positive force of the particle of the rod opposite the\r\nair and the negative force of the particle of air towards the rod, the\r\nwhole particle of air becomes positively electrified; and when, the next\r\ninstant, the discharged part of the rod resumes its positive state by\r\nconduction from the surface of metal behind, it not only acts on the\r\nparticles beyond A, by throwing A into a polarized state again, but A\r\nitself, because of its charged state, exerts a distinct inductive act\r\ntowards these further particles, and the tension is consequently so much\r\nexalted between A and B, that discharge takes place there also, as well as\r\nagain between the metal and A.\r\n\r\n1435. In addition to this effect, it has been shown, that, the act of\r\ndischarge having once commenced, the whole operation, like a case of\r\nunstable equilibrium, is hastened to a conclusion (1370. 1418.), the rest\r\nof the act being facilitated in its occurrence, and other electricity than\r\nthat which caused the first necessary tension hurrying to the spot. When,\r\ntherefore, disruptive discharge has once commenced at the root of a brush,\r\nthe electric force which has been accumulating in the conductor attached to\r\nthe rod, finds a more ready discharge there than elsewhere, and will at\r\nonce follow the course marked out as it were for it, thus leaving the\r\nconductor in a partially discharged state, and the air about the end of the\r\nwire in a charged condition; and the time necessary for restoring the full\r\ncharge of the conductor, and the dispersion of the charged air in a greater\r\nor smaller degree, by the joint forces of repulsion from the conductor and\r\nattraction towards the walls of the room, to which its inductive action is\r\ndirected, is just that time which forms the interval between brush and\r\nbrush (1420. 1427. 1431. 1447.).\r\n\r\n1436. The words of this description are long, but there is nothing in the\r\nact or the forces on which it depends to prevent the discharge being\r\n_instantaneous_, as far as we can estimate and measure it. The\r\nconsideration of _time_ is, however, important in several points of view\r\n(1418.), and in reference to disruptive discharge, it seemed from theory\r\nfar more probable that it might be detected in a brush than in a spark; for\r\nin a brush, the particles in the line through which the discharge passes\r\nare in very different states as to intensity, and the discharge is already\r\ncomplete in its act at the root of the brush, before the particles at the\r\nextremity of the ramifications have yet attained their maximum intensity.\r\n\r\n1437. I consider _brush_ discharge as probably a successive effect in this\r\nway. Discharge begins at the root (1426. 1553.), and, extending itself in\r\nsuccession to all parts of the single brush, continues to go on at the root\r\nand the previously formed parts until the whole brush is complete; then, by\r\nthe fall in intensity and power at the conductor, it ceases at once in all\r\nparts, to be renewed, when that power has risen again to a sufficient\r\ndegree. But in a _spark_, the particles in the line of discharge being,\r\nfrom the circumstances, nearly alike in their intensity of polarization,\r\nsuffer discharge so nearly at the same moment as to make the time quite\r\ninsensible to us.\r\n\r\n1438. Mr. Wheatstone has already made experiments which fully illustrate\r\nthis point. He found that the brush generally had a sensible duration, but\r\nthat with his highest capabilities he could not detect any such effect in\r\nthe spark[A]. I repeated his experiment on the brush, though with more\r\nimperfect means, to ascertain whether I could distinguish a longer duration\r\nin the stem or root of the brush than in the extremities, and the\r\nappearances were such as to make me think an effect of this kind was\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1836, pp. 586, 590.\r\n\r\n1439. That the discharge breaks into several ramifications, and by them\r\npasses through portions of air alike, or nearly alike, as to polarization\r\nand the degree of tension the particles there have acquired, is a very\r\nnatural result of the previous state of things, and rather to be expected\r\nthan that the discharge should continue to go straight out into space in a\r\nsingle line amongst those particles which, being at a distance from the end\r\nof the rod, are in a lower state of tension than those which are near: and\r\nwhilst we cannot but conclude, that those parts where the branches of a\r\nsingle brush appear, are more favourably circumstanced for discharge than\r\nthe darker parts between the ramifications, we may also conclude, that in\r\nthose parts where the light of concomitant discharge is equal, there the\r\ncircumstances are nearly equal also. The single successive brushes are by\r\nno means of the same particular shape even when they are observed without\r\ndisplacement of the rod or surrounding objects (1427. 1433.), and the\r\nsuccessive discharges may be considered as taking place into the mass of\r\nair around, through different roads at each brush, according as minute\r\ncircumstances, such as dust, &c. (1391. 1392.), may have favoured the\r\ncourse by one set of particles rather than another.\r\n\r\n1440. Brush discharge does not essentially require any current of the\r\nmedium in which the brush appears: the current almost always occurs, but is\r\na consequence of the brush, and will be considered hereafter (1562-1610.).\r\nOn holding a blunt point positively charged towards uninsulated water, a\r\nstar or glow appeared on the point, a current of air passed from it, and\r\nthe surface of the water was depressed; but on bringing the point so near\r\nthat sonorous brushes passed, then the current of air instantly ceased, and\r\nthe surface of the water became level.\r\n\r\n1441. The discharge by a brush is not to all the particles of air that are\r\nnear the electrified conductor from which the brush issues; only those\r\nparts where the ramifications pass are electrified: the air in the central\r\ndark parts between them receives no charge, and, in fact, at the time of\r\ndischarge, has its electric and inductive tension considerably lowered. For\r\nconsider fig. 128 to represent a single positive brush;--the induction\r\nbefore the discharge is from the end of the rod outwards, in diverging\r\nlines towards the distant conductors, as the walls of the room, &c., and a\r\nparticle at _a_ has polarity of a certain degree of tension, and tends with\r\na certain force to become charged; but at the moment of discharge, the air\r\nin the ramifications _b_ and _d_, acquiring also a positive state, opposes\r\nits influence to that of the positive conductor on _a_, and the tension of\r\nthe particle at _a_ is therefore diminished rather than increased. The\r\ncharged particles at _b_ and _d_ are now inductive bodies, but their lines\r\nof inductive action are still outwards towards the walls of the room; the\r\ndirection of the polarity and the tendency of other particles to charge\r\nfrom these, being governed by, or in conformity with, these lines of force.\r\n\r\n1442. The particles that are charged are probably very highly charged, but,\r\nthe medium being a non-conductor, they cannot communicate that state to\r\ntheir neighbours. They travel, therefore, under the influence of the\r\nrepulsive and attractive forces, from the charged conductor towards the\r\nnearest uninsulated conductor, or the nearest body in a different state to\r\nthemselves, just as charged particles of dust would travel, and are then\r\ndischarged; each particle acting, in its course, as a centre of inductive\r\nforce upon any bodies near which it may come. The travelling of these\r\ncharged particles when they are numerous, causes wind and currents, but\r\nthese will come into consideration under _carrying discharge_ (1319. 1562.\r\n&c.).\r\n\r\n1443. When air is said to be electrified, and it frequently assumes this\r\nstate near electrical machines, it consists, according to my view, of a\r\nmixture of electrified and unelectrified particles, the latter being in\r\nvery large proportion to the former. When we gather electricity from air,\r\nby a flame or by wires, it is either by the actual discharge of these\r\nparticles, or by effects dependent on their inductive action, a case of\r\neither kind being produceable at pleasure. That the law of equality between\r\nthe two forces or forms of force in inductive action is as strictly\r\npreserved in these as in other cases, is fully shown by the fact, formerly\r\nstated (1173. 1174.), that, however strongly air in a vessel might be\r\ncharged positively, there was an exactly equal amount of negative force on\r\nthe inner surface of the vessel itself, for no residual portion of either\r\nthe one or the other electricity could be obtained.\r\n\r\n1444. I have nowhere said, nor does it follow, that the air is charged only\r\nwhere the luminous brush appears. The charging may extend beyond those\r\nparts which are visible, i.e. particles to the right or left of the lines\r\nof light may receive electricity, the parts which are luminous being so\r\nonly because much electricity is passing by them to other parts (1437.);\r\njust as in a spark discharge the light is greater as more electricity\r\npasses, though it has no necessary relation to the quantity required to\r\ncommence discharge (1370. 1420.). Hence the form we see in a brush may by\r\nno means represent the whole quantity of air electrified; for an invisible\r\nportion, clothing the visible form to a certain depth, may, at the same\r\ntime, receive its charge (1552.).\r\n\r\n1445. Several effects which I have met with in muriatic acid gas tend to\r\nmake me believe, that that gaseous body allows of a dark discharge. At the\r\nsame time, it is quite clear from theory, that in some gases, the reverse\r\nof this may occur, i.e. that the charging of the air may not extend even so\r\nfar as the light. We do not know as yet enough of the electric light to be\r\nable to state on what it depends, and it is very possible that, when\r\nelectricity bursts forth into air, all the particles of which are in a\r\nstate of tension, light may be evolved by such as, being very near to, are\r\nnot of, those which actually receive a charge at the time.\r\n\r\n1446. The further a brush extends in a gas, the further no doubt is the\r\ncharge or discharge carried forward; but this may vary between different\r\ngases, and yet the intensity required for the first moment of discharge not\r\nvary in the same, but in some other proportion. Thus with respect to\r\nnitrogen and muriatic acid gases, the former, as far as my experiments have\r\nproceeded, produces far finer and larger brushes than the latter (1458.\r\n1462.), but the intensity required to commence discharge is much higher for\r\nthe muriatic acid than the nitrogen (1395.). Here again, therefore, as in\r\nmany other qualities, specific differences are presented by different\r\ngaseous dielectrics, and so prove the special relation of the latter to the\r\nact and the phenomena of induction.\r\n\r\n1447. To sum up these considerations respecting the character and condition\r\nof the brush, I may state that it is a spark to air; a diffusion of\r\nelectric force to matter, not by conduction, but disruptive discharge, a\r\ndilute spark which, passing to very badly conducting matter, frequently\r\ndischarges but a small portion of the power stored up in the conductor; for\r\nas the air charged reacts on the conductor, whilst the conductor, by loss\r\nof electricity, sinks in its force (1435.), the discharge quickly ceases,\r\nuntil by the dispersion of the charged air and the renewal of the excited\r\nconditions of the conductor, circumstances have risen up to their first\r\neffective condition, again to cause discharge, and again to fall and rise,\r\n\r\n1448. The brush and spark gradually pass into one another, Making a small\r\nball positive by a good electrical machine with a large prime conductor,\r\nand approaching a large uninsulated discharging ball towards it, very\r\nbeautiful variations from the spark to the brush may be obtained. The\r\ndrawings of long and powerful sparks, given by Van Marum[A], Harris[B], and\r\nothers, also indicate the same phenomena. As far as I have observed,\r\nwhenever the spark has been brushy in air of common pressures, the whole of\r\nthe electricity has not been discharged, but only portions of it, more or\r\nless according to circumstances; whereas, whenever the effect has been a\r\ndistinct spark throughout the whole of its course, the discharge has been\r\nperfect, provided no interruption had been made to it elsewhere, in the\r\ndischarging circuit, than where the spark occurred.\r\n\r\n  [A] Description of the Teylerian machine, vol. i. pp. 28. 32.; vol.\r\n  ii. p. 226, &c.\r\n\r\n  [B] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 213.\r\n\r\n1449. When an electrical brush from an inch to six inches in length or more\r\nis issuing into free air, it has the form given, fig. 117. But if the hand,\r\na ball, of any knobbed conductor be brought near, the extremities of the\r\ncoruscations turn towards it and each other, and the whole assumes various\r\nforms according to circumstances, as in figs. 119, 120, and 121. The\r\ninfluence of the circumstances in each case is easily traced, and I might\r\ndescribe it here, but that I should be ashamed to occupy the time of the\r\nSociety in things so evident. But how beautifully does the curvature of the\r\nramifications illustrate the curved form of the lines of inductive force\r\nexisting previous to the discharge! for the former are consequences of the\r\nlatter, and take their course, in each discharge, where the previous\r\ninductive tension had been raised to the proper degree. They represent\r\nthese curves just as well as iron filings represent magnetic curves, the\r\nvisible effects in both cases being the consequences of the action of the\r\nforces in _the places where_ the effects appear. The phenomena, therefore,\r\nconstitute additional and powerful testimony (1216. 1230.) to that already\r\ngiven in favour both of induction through dielectrics in curved lines\r\n(1231.), and of the lateral relation of these lines, by an effect\r\nequivalent to a repulsion producing divergence, or, as in the cases\r\nfigured, the bulging form.\r\n\r\n1450. In reference to the theory of molecular inductive action, I may also\r\nadd, the proof deducible from the long brushy ramifying spark which, may be\r\nobtained between a small ball on the positive conductor of an electrical\r\nmachine, and a larger one at a distance (1448. 1504.). What a fine\r\nillustration that spark affords of the previous condition of _all_ the\r\nparticles of the dielectric between the surfaces of discharge, and how\r\nunlike the appearances are to any which would be deduced from the theory\r\nwhich assumes inductive action to be action at a distance, in straight\r\nlines only; and charge, as being electricity retained upon the surface of\r\nconductors by the mere pressure of the atmosphere!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1451. When the brush is obtained in rarefied air, the appearances vary\r\ngreatly, according to circumstances, and are exceedingly beautiful.\r\nSometimes a brush may be formed of only six or seven branches, these being\r\nbroad and highly luminous, of a purple colour, and in some parts an inch or\r\nmore apart: by a spark discharge at the prime conductor (1455.) single\r\nbrushes may be obtained at pleasure. Discharge in the form of a brush is\r\nfavoured by rarefaction of the air, in the same manner and for the same\r\nreason as discharge in the form of a spark (1375.); but in every case there\r\nis previous induction and charge through the dielectric, and polarity of\r\nits particles (1437.), the induction being, as in any other instance,\r\nalternately raised by the machine and lowered by the discharge. In certain\r\nexperiments the rarefaction was increased to the utmost degree, and the\r\nopposed conducting surfaces brought as near together as possible without\r\nproducing glow (1529.): the brushes then contracted in their lateral\r\ndimensions, and recurred so rapidly as to form an apparently continuous arc\r\nof light from metal to metal. Still the discharge could be observed to\r\nintermit (1427.), so that even under these high conditions, induction\r\npreceded each single brush, and the tense polarized condition of the\r\ncontiguous particles was a necessary preparation for the discharge itself.\r\n\r\n1452. The brush form of disruptive discharge may be obtained not only in\r\nair and gases, but also in much denser media. I procured it in _oil of\r\nturpentine_ from the end of a wire going through a glass tube into the\r\nfluid contained in a metal vessel. The brush was small and very difficult\r\nto obtain; the ramifications were simple, and stretched out from each\r\nother, diverging very much. The light was exceedingly feeble, a perfectly\r\ndark room being required for its observation. When a few solid particles,\r\nas of dust or silk, were in the liquid, the brush was produced with much\r\ngreater facility.\r\n\r\n1453. The running together or coalescence of different lines of discharge\r\n(1412.) is very beautifully shown in the brush in air. This point may\r\npresent a little difficulty to those who are not accustomed to see in every\r\ndischarge an equal exertion of power in opposite directions, a positive\r\nbrush being considered by such (perhaps in consequence of the common phrase\r\n_direction of a current_) as indicating a breaking forth in different\r\ndirections of the original force, rather than a tendency to convergence and\r\nunion in one line of passage. But the ordinary case of the brush may be\r\ncompared, for its illustration, with that in which, by holding the knuckle\r\nopposite to highly excited glass, a discharge occurs, the ramifications of\r\na brush then leading from the glass and converging into a spark on the\r\nknuckle. Though a difficult experiment to make, it is possible to obtain\r\ndischarge between highly excited shell-lac and the excited glass of a\r\nmachine: when the discharge passes, it is, from the nature of the charged\r\nbodies, brush at each end and spark in the middle, beautifully illustrating\r\nthat tendency of discharge to facilitate like action, which I have\r\ndescribed in a former page (1418.).\r\n\r\n1454. The brush has _specific characters_ in different gases, indicating a\r\nrelation to the particles of these bodies even in a stronger degree than\r\nthe spark (1422. 1423.). This effect is in strong contrast with the\r\nnon-variation caused by the use of different substances as _conductors_\r\nfrom which the brushes are to originate. Thus, using such bodies as wood,\r\ncard, charcoal, nitre, citric acid, oxalic acid, oxide of lead, chloride of\r\nlead, carbonate of potassa, potassa fusa, strong solution of potash, oil of\r\nvitriol, sulphur, sulphuret of antimony, and hæmatite, no variation in the\r\ncharacter of the brushes was obtained, except that (dependent upon their\r\neffect as better or worse conductors) of causing discharge with more or\r\nless readiness and quickness from the machine[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Exception must, of course, be made of those cases where the root\r\n  of the brush, becoming a spark, causes a little diffusion or even\r\n  decomposition of the matter there, and so gains more or less of a\r\n  particular colour at that part.\r\n\r\n1455. The following are a few of the effects I observed in different gasses\r\nat the positively charged surfaces, and with atmospheres varying in their\r\npressure. The general effect of rarefaction was the same for all the gases:\r\nat first, sparks passed; these gradually were converted into brushes, which\r\nbecame larger and more distinct in their ramifications, until, upon further\r\nrarefaction, the latter began to collapse and draw in upon each other, till\r\nthey formed a stream across from conductor to conductor: then a few lateral\r\nstreams shot out towards the glass of the vessel from the conductors; these\r\nbecame thick and soft in appearance, and were succeeded by the full\r\nconstant glow which covered the discharging wire. The phenomena varied with\r\nthe size of the vessel (1477.), the degree of rarefaction, and the\r\ndischarge of electricity from the machine. When the latter was in\r\nsuccessive sparks, they were most beautiful, the effect of a spark from a\r\nsmall machine being equal to, and often surpassing, that produced by the\r\n_constant_ discharge of a far more powerful one.\r\n\r\n1456. _Air._--Fine positive brushes are easily obtained in air at common\r\npressures, and possess the well-known purplish light. When the air is\r\nrarefied, the ramifications are very long, filling the globe (1477.); the\r\nlight is greatly increased, and is of a beautiful purple colour, with an\r\noccasional rose tint in it.\r\n\r\n1457. _Oxygen._--At common pressures, the brush is very close and\r\ncompressed, and of a dull whitish colour. In rarefied oxygen, the form and\r\nappearance are better, the colour somewhat purplish, but all the characters\r\nvery poor compared to those in air.\r\n\r\n1458. _Nitrogen_ gives brushes with great facility at the positive surface,\r\nfar beyond any other gas I have tried: they are almost always fine in form,\r\nlight, and colour, and in rarefied nitrogen, are magnificent. They surpass\r\nthe discharges in any other gas as to the quantity of light evolved.\r\n\r\n1459. _Hydrogen_, at common pressures, gave a better brush than oxygen, but\r\ndid not equal nitrogen; the colour was greenish gray. In rarefied hydrogen,\r\nthe ramifications were very fine in form and distinctness, but pale in\r\ncolour, with a soft and velvety appearance, and not at all equal to those\r\nin nitrogen. In the rarest state of the gas, the colour of the light was a\r\npale gray green.\r\n\r\n1460. _Coal gas._--The brushes were rather difficult to produce, the\r\ncontrast with nitrogen being great in this respect. They were short and\r\nstrong, generally of a greenish colour, and possessing much of the spark\r\ncharacter: for, occurring on both the positive and negative terminations,\r\noften when there was a dark interval of some length between the two\r\nbrushes, still the quick, sharp sound of the spark was produced, as if the\r\ndischarge had been sudden through this gas, and partaking, in that respect,\r\nof the character of a spark. In rare coal gas, the brush forms were better,\r\nbut the light very poor and the colour gray.\r\n\r\n1461. _Carbonic acid gas_ produces a very poor brush at common pressures,\r\nas regards either size, light, or colour; and this is probably connected\r\nwith the tendency which this gas has to discharge the electricity as a\r\nspark (1422.). In rarefied carbonic acid, the brush is better in form, but\r\nweak as to light, being of a dull greenish or purplish line, varying with\r\nthe pressure and other circumstances.\r\n\r\n1462. _Muriatic acid gas._--It is very difficult to obtain the brush in\r\nthis gas at common pressures. On gradually increasing the distance of the\r\nrounded ends, the sparks suddenly ceased when the interval was about an\r\ninch, and the discharge, which was still through the gas in the globe, was\r\nsilent and dark. Occasionally a very short brush could for a few moments be\r\nobtained, but it quickly disappeared. Even when the intermitting spark\r\ncurrent (1455.) from the machine was used, still I could only with\r\ndifficulty obtain a brush, and that very short, though I used rods with\r\nrounded terminations (about 0.25 of an inch in diameter) which had before\r\ngiven them most freely in air and nitrogen. During the time of this\r\ndifficulty with the muriatic gas, magnificent brushes were passing off from\r\ndifferent parts of the machine into the surrounding air. On rarefying the\r\ngas, the formation of the brush was facilitated, but it was generally of a\r\nlow squat form, very poor in light, and very similar on both the positive\r\nand negative surfaces. On rarefying the gas still more, a few large\r\nramifications were obtained of a pale bluish colour, utterly unlike those\r\nin nitrogen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1463. In all the gases, the different forms of disruptive discharge may be\r\nlinked together and gradually traced from one extreme to the other, i.e.\r\nfrom the spark to the glow (1405. 1526.), or, it may be, to a still further\r\ncondition to be called dark discharge (1544-1560.); but it is,\r\nnevertheless, very surprising to see what a specific character each keeps\r\nwhilst under the predominance of the general law. Thus, in muriatic acid,\r\nthe brush is very difficult to obtain, and there comes in its place almost\r\na dark discharge, partaking of the readiness of the spark action. Moreover,\r\nin muriatic acid, I have _never_ observed the spark with any dark interval\r\nin it. In nitrogen, the spark readily changes its character into that of\r\nbrush. In carbonic acid gas, there seems to be a facility to occasion spark\r\ndischarge, whilst yet that gas is unlike nitrogen in the facility of the\r\nlatter to form brushes, and unlike muriatic acid in its own facility to\r\ncontinue the spark. These differences add further force, first to the\r\nobservations already made respecting the spark in various gases (1422.\r\n1423.), and then, to the proofs deducible from it, of the relation of the\r\nelectrical forces to the particles of matter.\r\n\r\n1464. The peculiar characters of nitrogen in relation to the electric\r\ndischarge (1422. 1458.) must, evidently, have an important influence over\r\nthe form and even the occurrence of lightning. Being that gas which most\r\nreadily produces coruscations, and, by them, extends discharge to a greater\r\ndistance than any other gas tried, it is also that which constitutes\r\nfour-fifths of our atmosphere; and as, in atmospheric electrical phenomena,\r\none, and sometimes both the inductive forces are resident on the particles\r\nof the air, which, though probably affected as to conducting power by the\r\naqueous particles in it, cannot be considered as a good conductor; so the\r\npeculiar power possessed by nitrogen, to originate and effect discharge in\r\nthe form of a brush or of ramifications, has, probably, an important\r\nrelation to its electrical service in nature, as it most seriously affects\r\nthe character and condition of the discharge when made. The whole subject\r\nof discharge from and through gases is of great interest, and, if only in\r\nreference to atmospheric electricity, deserves extensive and close\r\nexperimental investigation.\r\n\r\n_Difference of discharge at the positive and negative conducting surfaces._\r\n\r\n1465. I have avoided speaking of this well-known phenomenon more than was\r\nquite necessary, that I might bring together here what I have to say on the\r\nsubject. When the brush discharge is observed in air at the positive and\r\nnegative surfaces, there is a very remarkable difference, the true and full\r\ncomprehension of which would, no doubt, be of the utmost importance to the\r\nphysics of electricity; it would throw great light on our present subject,\r\ni.e. the molecular action of dielectrics under induction, and its\r\nconsequences; and seems very open to, and accessible by, experimental\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n1466. The difference in question used to be expressed in former times by\r\nsaying, that a point charged positively gave brushes into the air, whilst\r\nthe same point charged negatively gave a star. This is true only of bad\r\nconductors, or of metallic conductors charged intermittingly, or otherwise\r\ncontrolled by collateral induction. If metallic points project _freely_\r\ninto the air, the positive and negative light upon them differ very little\r\nin appearance, and the difference can be observed only upon close\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n1467. The effect varies exceedingly under different circumstances, but, as\r\nwe must set out from some position, may perhaps be stated thus: if a\r\nmetallic wire with a rounded termination in free air be used to produce the\r\nbrushy discharge, then the brushes obtained when the wire is charged\r\nnegatively are very poor and small, by comparison with those produced when\r\nthe charge is positive. Or if a large metal ball connected with the\r\nelectrical machine be charged _positively_, and a fine uninsulated point be\r\ngradually brought towards it, a star appears on the point when at a\r\nconsiderable distance, which, though it becomes brighter, does not change\r\nits form of a star until it is close up to the ball: whereas, if the ball\r\nbe charged negatively, the point at a considerable distance has a star on\r\nit as before; but when brought nearer, (in my case to the distance of 1-1/2\r\ninch,) a brush formed on it, extending to the negative ball; and when still\r\nnearer, (at 1/8 of an inch distance,) the brush ceased, and bright sparks\r\npassed. These variations, I believe, include the whole series of\r\ndifferences, and they seem to show at once, that the negative surface tends\r\nto retain its discharging character unchanged, whilst the positive surface,\r\nunder similar circumstances, permits of great variation.\r\n\r\n1468. There are several points in the character of the negative discharge\r\nto air which it is important to observe. A metal rod, 0.3 of an inch in\r\ndiameter, with a rounded end projecting into the air, was charged\r\nnegatively, and gave a short noisy brush (fig. 122.). It was ascertained\r\nboth by sight (1427. 1433.) and sound (1431.), that the successive\r\ndischarges were very rapid in their recurrence, being seven or eight times\r\nmore numerous in the same period, than those produced when the rod was\r\ncharged positively to an equal degree. When the rod was positive, it was\r\neasy, by working the machine a little quicker, to replace the brush by a\r\nglow (1405. 1463.), but when it was negative no efforts could produce this\r\nchange. Even by bringing the hand opposite the wire, the only effect was to\r\nincrease the number of brush discharges in a given period, raising at the\r\nsame time the sound to a higher pitch.\r\n\r\n1469. A point opposite the negative brush exhibited a star, and as it was\r\napproximated caused the size and sound of the negative brush to diminish,\r\nand, at last, to cease, leaving the negative end silent and dark, yet\r\neffective as to discharge.\r\n\r\n1470. When the round end of a smaller wire (fig. 123.) was advanced towards\r\nthe negative brush, it (becoming positive by induction) exhibited the quiet\r\nglow at 8 inches distance, the negative brush continuing. When nearer, the\r\npitch of the sound of the negative brush rose, indicating quicker\r\nintermittences (1431.); still nearer, the positive end threw off\r\nramifications and distinct brushes; at the same time, the negative brush\r\ncontracted in its lateral directions and collected together, giving a\r\npeculiar narrow longish brush, in shape like a hair pencil, the two brushes\r\nexisting at once, but very different in their form and appearance, and\r\nespecially in the more rapid recurrence of the negative discharges than of\r\nthe positive. On using a smaller positive wire for the same experiment, the\r\nglow first appeared on it, and then the brush, the negative brush being\r\naffected at the same time; and the two at one distance became exceedingly\r\nalike in appearance, and the sounds, I thought, were in unison; at all\r\nevents they were in harmony, so that the intermissions of discharge were\r\neither isochronous, or a simple ratio existed between the intervals. With a\r\nhigher action of the machine, the wires being retained unaltered, the\r\nnegative surface became dark and silent, and a glow appeared on the\r\npositive one. A still higher action changed the latter into a spark. Finer\r\npositive wires gave other variations of these effects, the description of\r\nwhich I must not allow myself to go into here.\r\n\r\n1471. A thinner rod was now connected with the negative conductor in place\r\nof the larger one (1468.), its termination being gradually diminished to a\r\nblunt point, as in fig. 124; and it was beautiful to observe that,\r\nnotwithstanding the variation of the brush, the same general order of\r\neffects was produced. The end gave a small sonorous negative brush, which\r\nthe approach of the hand or a large conducting surface did not alter, until\r\nit was so near as to produce a spark. A fine point opposite to it was\r\nluminous at a distance; being nearer it did not destroy the light and sound\r\nof the negative brush, but only tended to have a brush produced on itself,\r\nwhich, at a still less distance, passed into a spark joining the two\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\n1472. When the distinct negative and positive brushes are produced\r\nsimultaneously in relation to each other in air, the former almost always\r\nhas a contracted form, as in fig. 125, very much indeed resembling the\r\nfigure which the positive brush itself has when influenced by the lateral\r\nvicinity of positive parts acting by induction. Thus a brush issuing from a\r\npoint in the re-entering angle of a positive conductor has the same\r\ncompressed form (fig. 126.).\r\n\r\n1473. The character of the negative brush is not affected by the chemical\r\nnature of the substances of the conductors (1454.), but only by their\r\npossession of the conducting power in a greater or smaller degree.\r\n\r\n1474. Rarefaction of common air about a negative ball or blunt point\r\nfacilitated the development of the negative brush, the effect being, I\r\nthink, greater than on a positive brush, though great on both. Extensive\r\nramifications could be obtained from a ball or end electrified negatively\r\nto the plate of the air-pump on which the jar containing it stood.\r\n\r\n1475. A very important variation of the relative forms and conditions of\r\nthe positive and negative brush takes place on varying the dielectric in\r\nwhich they are produced. The difference is so very great that it points to\r\na specific relation of this form of discharge to the particular gas in\r\nwhich it takes place, and opposes the idea that gases are but obstructions\r\nto the discharge, acting one like another and merely in proportion to their\r\npressure (1377.).\r\n\r\n1476. In _air_, the superiority of the positive brush is well known (1467.\r\n1472.). In _nitrogen_, it is as great or even greater than in air (1458.).\r\nIn _hydrogen_, the positive brush loses a part of its superiority, not\r\nbeing so good as in nitrogen or air; whilst the negative brush does not\r\nseem injured (1459.). In _oxygen_, the positive brush is compressed and\r\npoor (1457); whilst the negative did not become less: the two were so alike\r\nthat the eye frequently could not tell one from the other, and this\r\nsimilarity continued when the oxygen was gradually rarefied. In _coal gas_,\r\nthe brushes are difficult of production as compared to nitrogen (1460.),\r\nand the positive not much superior to the negative in its character, either\r\nat common or low pressures. In _carbonic acid gas_, this approximation of\r\ncharacter also occurred. In _muriatic acid gas_, the positive brush was\r\nvery little better than the negative, and both difficult to produce (1462.)\r\nas compared with the facility in nitrogen or air.\r\n\r\n1477. These experiments were made with rods of brass about a quarter of an\r\ninch thick having rounded ends, these being opposed in a glass globe 7\r\ninches in diameter, containing the gas to be experimented with. The\r\nelectric machine was used to communicate directly, sometimes the positive,\r\nand sometimes the negative state, to the rod in connection with it.\r\n\r\n1478. Thus we see that, notwithstanding there is a general difference in\r\nfavour of the superiority of the positive brush over the negative, that\r\ndifference is at its maximum in nitrogen and air; whilst in carbonic acid,\r\nmuriatic acid, coal gas, and oxygen, it diminishes, and at last almost\r\ndisappears. So that in this particular effect, as in all others yet\r\nexamined, the evidence is in favour of that view which refers the results\r\nto a direct relation of the electric forces with the molecules of the\r\nmatter concerned in the action (1421. 1423. 1463.). Even when special\r\nphenomena arise under the operation of the general law, the theory adopted\r\nseems fully competent to meet the case.\r\n\r\n1479. Before I proceed further in tracing the probable cause of the\r\ndifference between the positive and negative brush discharge, I wish to\r\nknow the results of a few experiments which are in course of preparation:\r\nand thinking this Series of Researches long enough, I shall here close it\r\nwith the expectation of being able in a few weeks to renew the inquiry, and\r\nentirely redeem my pledge (1306.).\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution,\r\nDec. 23rd, 1837._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTEENTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 18. _On Induction (continued)._ ¶ ix. _Disruptive discharge\r\n(continued)--Peculiarities of positive and negative discharge either as\r\nspark or brush--Glow discharge--Dark discharge._ ¶ x. _Convection, or\r\ncarrying discharge._ ¶ xi. _Relation of a vacuum to electrical phenomena._\r\n§ 19. _Nature of the electrical current._\r\n\r\nReceived February 22,--Read March 15, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ ix. _Disruptive discharge (continued)._\r\n\r\n\r\n1480. Let us now direct our attention to the general difference of the\r\npositive and negative disruptive discharge, with the object of tracing, as\r\nfar as possible, the cause of that difference, and whether it depends on\r\nthe charged conductors principally, or on the interposed dielectric; and as\r\nit appears to be great in air and nitrogen (1476.), let us observe the\r\nphenomena in air first.\r\n\r\n1481. The general case is best understood by a reference to surfaces of\r\nconsiderable size rather than to points, which involve (as a secondary\r\neffect) the formation of currents (1562). My investigation, therefore, was\r\ncarried on with balls and terminations of different diameters, and the\r\nfollowing are some of the principal results.\r\n\r\n1482. If two balls of very different dimensions, as for instance one-half\r\nan inch, and the other three inches in diameter, be arranged at the ends of\r\nrods so that either can be electrified by a machine and made to discharge\r\nby sparks to the other, which is at the same time uninsulated; then, as is\r\nwell known, far longer sparks are obtained when the small ball is positive\r\nand the large ball negative, than when the small ball is negative and the\r\nlarge ball positive. In the former case, the sparks are 10 or 12 inches in\r\nlength; in the latter, an inch or an inch and a half only.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1483. But previous to the description of further experiments, I will\r\nmention two words, for which with many others I am indebted to a friend,\r\nand which I think it would be expedient to introduce and use. It is\r\nimportant in ordinary inductive action, to distinguish at which charged\r\nsurface the induction originates and is sustained: i.e. if two or more\r\nmetallic balls, or other masses of matter, are in inductive relation, to\r\nexpress which are charged originally, and which are brought by them into\r\nthe opposite electrical condition. I propose to call those bodies which are\r\noriginally charged, _inductric_ bodies; and those which assume the opposite\r\nstate, in consequence of the induction, _inducteous_ bodies. This\r\ndistinction is not needful because there is any difference between the sums\r\nof the _inductric_ and the _inducteous_ forces; but principally because,\r\nwhen a ball A is inductric, it not merely brings a ball B, which is\r\nopposite to it, into an inducteous state, but also many other surrounding\r\nconductors, though some of them may be a considerable distance off, and the\r\nconsequence is, that the balls do not bear the same precise relation to\r\neach other when, first one, and then the other, is made the inductric ball;\r\nthough, in each case, the _same ball_ be made to assume the _same state._\r\n\r\n1484, Another liberty which I may also occasionally take in language I will\r\nexplain and limit. It is that of calling a particular spark or brush,\r\n_positive_ or _negative_, according as it may be considered as\r\n_originating_ at a positive or a negative surface. We speak of the brush as\r\npositive or negative when it shoots out from surfaces previously in those\r\nstates; and the experiments of Mr. Wheatstone go to prove that it _really\r\nbegins_ at the charged surface, and from thence extends into the air (1437.\r\n1438.) or other dielectric. According to my view, _sparks_ also originate\r\nor are determined at one particular spot (1370.), namely, that where the\r\ntension first rises up to the maximum degree; and when this can be\r\ndetermined, as in the simultaneous use of large and small balls, in which\r\ncase the discharge begins or is determined by the latter, I would call that\r\ndischarge which passes _at once_, a positive spark, if it was at the\r\npositive surface that the maximum intensity was first obtained; or a\r\nnegative spark, if that necessary intensity was first obtained at the\r\nnegative surface.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1485. An apparatus was arranged, as in fig. 129. (Plate VIII.): A and B\r\nwere brass balls of very different diameters attached to metal rods, moving\r\nthrough sockets on insulating pillars, so that the distance between the\r\nballs could be varied at pleasure. The large ball A, 2 inches in diameter,\r\nwas connected with an insulated brass conductor, which could be rendered\r\npositive or negative directly from a cylinder machine: the small ball B,\r\n0.25 of an inch in diameter, was connected with a discharging train (292.)\r\nand perfectly uninsulated. The brass rods sustaining the balls were 0.2 of\r\nan inch in thickness.\r\n\r\n1486. When the large ball was _positive_ and inductric (1483.), negative\r\nsparks occurred until the interval was 0.49 of an inch; then mixed brush\r\nand spark between that and 0.51; and from 0.52 and upwards, negative brush\r\nalone. When the large ball was made _negative_ and inductric, then positive\r\nspark alone occurred until the interval was as great as 1.15 inches; spark\r\nand brush from that up to 1.55; and to have the positive brush alone, it\r\nrequired an interval of at least 1.65 inches.\r\n\r\n1487. The balls A and B were now changed for each other. Then making the\r\nsmall ball B inductric _positively_, the positive sparks alone continued\r\nonly up to 0.67; spark and brush occurred from 0.68 up to 0.72; and\r\npositive brush alone from 0.74 and upwards. Rendering the small ball B\r\ninductric and _negative_, negative sparks alone occurred up to 0.40; then\r\nspark and brush at 0.42; whilst from 0.44 and upwards the noisy negative\r\nbrush alone took place.\r\n\r\n1488. We thus find a great difference as the balls are rendered inductric\r\nor inducteous; the small ball rendered _positive_ inducteously giving a\r\nspark nearly twice as long as that produced when it was charged positive\r\ninductrically, and a corresponding difference, though not, under the\r\ncircumstances, to the same extent, was manifest, when it was rendered\r\n_negative_[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] For similar experiments on different gases, see 1518.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1489. Other results are, that the small ball rendered positive gives a much\r\nlonger spark than when it is rendered negative, and that the small ball\r\nrendered negative gives a brush more readily than when positive, in\r\nrelation to the effect produced by increasing the distance between the two\r\nballs.\r\n\r\n1490. When the interval was below 0.4 of an inch, so that the small ball\r\nshould give sparks, whether positive or negative, I could not observe that\r\nthere was any constant difference, either in their ready occurrence or the\r\nnumber which passed in a given time. But when the interval was such that\r\nthe small ball when negative gave a brush, then the discharges from it, as\r\nseparate negative brushes, were far more numerous than the corresponding\r\ndischarges from it when rendered positive, whether those positive\r\ndischarges were as sparks or brushes.\r\n\r\n1491. It is, therefore, evident that, when a ball is discharging\r\nelectricity in the form of brushes, the brushes are far more numerous, and\r\neach contains or carries off far less electric force when the electricity\r\nso discharged is negative, than when it is positive.\r\n\r\n1492. In all such experiments as those described, the point of change from\r\nspark to brush is very much governed by the working state of the electrical\r\nmachine and the size of the conductor connected with the discharging ball.\r\nIf the machine be in strong action and the conductor large, so that much\r\npower is accumulated quickly for each discharge, then the interval is\r\ngreater at which the sparks are replaced by brushes; but the general effect\r\nis the same[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] For similar experiments in different gases, see 1510-1517.--_Dec.\r\n  1838._\r\n\r\n1493. These results, though indicative of very striking and peculiar\r\nrelations of the electric force or forces, do not show the relative degrees\r\nof charge which the small ball acquires before discharge occurs, i.e. they\r\ndo not tell whether it acquires a higher condition in the negative, or in\r\nthe positive state, immediately preceding that discharge. To illustrate\r\nthis important point I arranged two places of discharge as represented, fig\r\n130. A and D are brass balls 2 inches diameter, B and C are smaller brass\r\nballs 0.25 of an inch in diameter; the forks L and R supporting them were\r\nof brass wire 0.2 of an inch in diameter; the space between the large and\r\nsmall ball on the same fork was 5 inches, that the two places of discharge\r\n_n_ and _o_ might be sufficiently removed from each other's influence. The\r\nfork L was connected with a projecting cylindrical conductor, which could\r\nbe rendered positive or negative at pleasure, by an electrical machine, and\r\nthe fork R was attached to another conductor, but thrown into an\r\nuninsulated state by connection with a discharging train (292.). The two\r\nintervals or places of discharge _n_ and _o_ could be varied at pleasure,\r\ntheir extent being measured by the occasional introduction of a diagonal\r\nscale. It is evident, that, as the balls A and B connected with the same\r\nconductor are always charged at once, and that discharge may take place to\r\neither of the balls connected with the discharging train, the intervals of\r\ndischarge _n_ and _o_ may be properly compared to each other, as respects\r\nthe influence of large and small balls when charged positively and\r\nnegatively in air.\r\n\r\n1494. When the intervals _n_ and _o_ were each made = 0.9 of an inch, and\r\nthe balls A and B inductric _positively_, the discharge was all at _n_ from\r\nthe small ball of the conductor to the large ball of the discharging train,\r\nand mostly by positive brush, though once by a spark. When the balls A and\r\nB were made inductric _negatively_, the discharge was still from the same\r\nsmall ball, at _n_, by a constant negative brush.\r\n\r\n1495. I diminished the intervals _n_ and _o_ to 0.6 of an inch. When A and\r\nB were inductric _positively_, all the discharge was at _n_ as a positive\r\nbrush: when A and B were inductric _negatively_, still all the discharge\r\nwas at _n_, as a negative brush.\r\n\r\n1496. The facility of discharge at the positive and negative small balls,\r\ntherefore, did not appear to be very different. If a difference had\r\nexisted, there were always two small balls, one in each state, that the\r\ndischarge might happen at that most favourable to the effect. The only\r\ndifference was, that one was in the inductric, and the other in the\r\ninducteous state, but whichsoever happened for the time to be in that\r\nstate, whether positive or negative, had the advantage.\r\n\r\n1497. To counteract this interfering influence, I made the interval _n_ =\r\n0.79 and interval _o_ = 0.58 of an inch. Then, when the balls A and B were\r\n_inductric positive_, the discharge was about equal at both intervals.\r\nWhen, on the other hand, the balls A and B were inductric _negative_, there\r\nwas discharge, still at both, but most at _n_, as if the small ball\r\n_negative_ could discharge a little easier than the same ball _positive_.\r\n\r\n1498. The small balls and terminations used in these and similar\r\nexperiments may very correctly be compared, in their action, to the same\r\nballs and ends when electrified in free air at a much greater distance from\r\nconductors, than they were in those cases from each other. In the first\r\nplace, the discharge, even when as a spark, is, according to my view,\r\ndetermined, and, so to speak, begins at a spot on the surface of the small\r\nball (1374.), occurring when the intensity there has risen up to a certain\r\nmaximum degree (1370.); this determination of discharge at a particular\r\nspot first, being easily traced from the spark into the brush, by\r\nincreasing the distance, so as, at last, even to render the time evident\r\nwhich is necessary for the production of the effect (1436. 1438.). In the\r\nnext place, the large balls which I have used might be replaced by larger\r\nballs at a still greater distance, and so, by successive degrees, may be\r\nconsidered as passing into the sides of the rooms; these being under\r\ngeneral circumstances the inducteous bodies, whilst the small ball rendered\r\neither positive or negative is the inductric body.\r\n\r\n1499. But, as has long been recognised, the small ball is only a blunt end,\r\nand, electrically speaking, a point only a small ball; so that when a point\r\nor blunt end is throwing out its brushes into the air, it is acting exactly\r\nas the small balls have acted in the experiments already described, and by\r\nvirtue of the same properties and relations.\r\n\r\n1500. It may very properly be said with respect to the experiments, that\r\nthe large negative ball is as essential to the discharge as the small\r\npositive ball, and also that the large negative ball shows as much\r\nsuperiority over the large positive ball (which is inefficient in causing a\r\nspark from its opposed small negative ball) as the small positive ball does\r\nover the small negative ball; and probably when we understand the real\r\ncause of the difference, and refer it rather to the condition of the\r\nparticles of the dielectric than to the sizes of the conducting balls, we\r\nmay find much importance in such an observation. But for the present, and\r\nwhilst engaged in investigating the point, we may admit, what is the fact,\r\nthat the forces are of higher intensity at the surfaces of the smaller\r\nballs than at those of the larger (1372. 1374.); that the former,\r\ntherefore, determine the discharge, by first rising up to that exalted\r\ncondition which is necessary for it; and that, whether brought to this\r\ncondition by induction towards the walls of a room or the large balls I\r\nhave used, these may fairly be compared one with the other in their\r\ninfluence and actions.\r\n\r\n1501. The conclusions I arrive at are: first, that when two equal small\r\nconducting surfaces equally placed in air are electrified, one positively\r\nand the other negatively, that which is negative can discharge to the air\r\nat a tension a little lower than that required for the positive ball:\r\nsecond, that when discharge does take place, much more passes at each time\r\nfrom the positive than from the negative surface (1491.). The last\r\nconclusion is very abundantly proved by the optical analysis of the\r\npositive and negative brushes already described (1468.), the latter set of\r\ndischarges being found to recur five or six times oftener than the\r\nformer[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] A very excellent mode of examining the relation of small positive\r\n  and negative surfaces would be by the use of drops of gum water,\r\n  solutions, or other liquids. See onwards (1581. 1593.).\r\n\r\n1502. If, now, a small ball be made to give brushes or brushy sparks by a\r\npowerful machine, we can, in some measure, understand and relate the\r\ndifference perceived when it is rendered positive or negative. It is known\r\nto give when positive a much larger and more powerful spark than when\r\nnegative, and with greater facility (1482.): in fact, the spark, although\r\nit takes away so much more electricity at once, commences at a tension\r\nhigher only in a small degree, if at all. On the other hand, if rendered\r\nnegative, though discharge may commence at a lower degree, it continues but\r\nfor a very short period, very little electricity passing away each time.\r\nThese circumstances are directly related; for the extent to which the\r\npositive spark can reach, and the size and extent of the positive brush,\r\nare consequences of the capability which exists of much electricity passing\r\noff at one discharge from the positive surface (1468. 1501.).\r\n\r\n1503. But to refer these effects only to the form and size of the\r\nconductor, would, according to my notion of induction, be a very imperfect\r\nmode of viewing the whole question (1523. 1600.). I apprehend that the\r\neffects are due altogether to the mode in which the particles of the\r\ninterposed dielectric polarize, and I have already given some experimental\r\nindications of the differences presented by different electrics in this\r\nrespect (1475. 1476.). The modes of polarization, as I shall have occasion\r\nhereafter to show, may be very diverse in different dielectrics. With\r\nrespect to common air, what seems to be the consequence of a superiority in\r\nthe positive force at the surface of the small ball, may be due to the more\r\nexalted condition of the negative polarity of the particles of air, or of\r\nthe nitrogen in it (the negative part being, perhaps, more compressed,\r\nwhilst the positive part is more diffuse, or _vice versa_ (1687. &c.)); for\r\nsuch a condition could determine certain effects at the positive ball which\r\nwould not take place to the same degree at the negative ball, just as well\r\nas if the positive ball had possessed some special and independent power of\r\nits own.\r\n\r\n1504. The opinion, that the effects are more likely to be dependent upon\r\nthe dielectric than the ball, is supported by the character of the two\r\ndischarges. If a small positive ball be throwing off brushes with\r\nramifications ten inches long, how can the ball affect that part of a\r\nramification which is five inches from it? Yet the portion beyond that\r\nplace has the same character as that preceding it, and no doubt has that\r\ncharacter impressed by the same general principle and law. Looking upon the\r\naction of the contiguous particles of a dielectric as fully proved, I see,\r\nin such a ramification, a propagation of discharge from particle to\r\nparticle, each doing for the one next it what was done for it by the\r\npreceding particle, and what was done for the first particle by the charged\r\nmetal against which it was situated.\r\n\r\n1505. With respect to the general condition and relations of the positive\r\nand negative brushes in dense or rare air, or in other media and gases, if\r\nthey are produced at different times and places they are of course\r\nindependent of each other. But when they are produced from opposed ends or\r\nballs at the same time, in the same vessel of gas (1470. 1477.), they are\r\nfrequently related; and circumstances may be so arranged that they shall be\r\nisochronous, occurring in equal numbers in equal times; or shall occur in\r\nmultiples, i.e. with two or three negatives to one positive; or shall\r\nalternate, or be quite irregular. All these variations I have witnessed;\r\nand when it is considered that the air in the vessel, and also the glass of\r\nthe vessel, can take a momentary charge, it is easy to comprehend their\r\ngeneral nature and cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1506. Similar experiments to those in air (1485. 1493.) were made in\r\ndifferent gases, the results of which I will describe as briefly as\r\npossible. The apparatus is represented fig. 131, consisting of a bell-glass\r\neleven inches in diameter at the widest part, and ten and a half inches\r\nhigh up to the bottom of the neck. The balls are lettered, as in fig. 130,\r\nand are in the same relation to each other; but A and B were on separate\r\nsliding wires, which, however, were generally joined by a cross wire, _w_,\r\nabove, and that connected with the brass conductor, which received its\r\npositive or negative charge from the machine. The rods of A and B were\r\ngraduated at the part moving through the stuffing-box, so that the\r\napplication of a diagonal scale applied there, told what was the distance\r\nbetween these balls and those beneath them. As to the position of the balls\r\nin the jar, and their relation to each other, C and D were three and a\r\nquarter inches apart, their height above the pump plate five inches, and\r\nthe distance between any of the balls and the glass of the jar one inch and\r\nthree quarters at least, and generally more. The balls A and D were two\r\ninches in diameter, as before (1493.); the balls B and C only 0.15 of an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\nAnother apparatus was occasionally used in connection with that just\r\ndescribed, being an open discharger (fig. 132.), by which a comparison of\r\nthe discharge in air and that in gases could be obtained. The balls E and\r\nF, each 0.6 of an inch in diameter, were connected with sliding rods and\r\nother balls, and were insulated. When used for comparison, the brass\r\nconductor was associated at the same time with the balls A and B of figure\r\n131 and ball E of this apparatus (fig. 132.); whilst the balls C, D and F\r\nwere connected with the discharging train.\r\n\r\n1507. I will first tabulate the results as to the _restraining power_ of\r\nthe gases over discharge. The balls A and C (fig. 131.) were thrown out of\r\naction by distance, and the effects at B and D, or the interval _n_ in the\r\ngas, compared with those at the interval _p_ in the air, between E and F\r\n(fig. 132.). The Table sufficiently explains itself. It will be understood\r\nthat all discharge was in the air, when the interval there was less than\r\nthat expressed in the first or third columns of figures; and all the\r\ndischarge in the gas, when the interval in air was greater than that in the\r\nsecond or fourth column of figures. At intermediate distances the discharge\r\nwas occasionally at both places, i.e. sometimes in the air, sometimes in\r\nthe gas.\r\n\r\n _____________________________________________________________________\r\n|                 |                                                   |\r\n|                 |      Interval _p_ in parts of an inch             |\r\n|_________________|___________________________________________________|\r\n|                 |                         |                         |\r\n|                 | When the small ball B   | When the small ball B   |\r\n| Constant inter- |   was inductric and     |   was inductric and     |\r\n| val _n_ between |    _positive_ the       |    _negative_ the       |\r\n| B and D = 1     |   discharge was all     |   discharge was all     |\r\n| inch            | at _p_ in    at _n_ in  | at _p_ in    at _n_ in  |\r\n|                 | air before    the gas   | air before    the gas   |\r\n|                 |                after    |                after    |\r\n|_________________|_________________________|_________________________|\r\n|                 |    _p_ =   |    _p_ =   |    _p_ =   |    _p_ =   |\r\n|In Air           |    0.10    |    0.50    |    0.28    |    0.33    |\r\n|In Nitrogen      |    0.30    |    0.65    |    0.31    |    0.40    |\r\n|In Oxygen        |    0.33    |    0.52    |    0.27    |    0.30    |\r\n|In Hydrogen      |    0.20    |    0.10    |    0.22    |    0.24    |\r\n|In Coal Gas      |    0.20    |    0.90    |    0.20    |    0.27    |\r\n|In Carbonic Acid |    0.61    |    1.30    |    0.30    |    0.15    |\r\n|_________________|____________|____________|____________|____________|\r\n\r\n1508. These results are the same generally, as far as they go, as those of\r\nthe like nature in the last series (1388.), and confirm the conclusion that\r\ndifferent gases restrain discharge in very different proportions. They are\r\nprobably not so good as the former ones, for the glass jar not being\r\nvarnished, acted irregularly, sometimes taking a certain degree of charge\r\nas a non-conductor, and at other times acting as a conductor in the\r\nconveyance and derangement of that charge. Another cause of difference in\r\nthe ratios is, no doubt, the relative sizes of the discharge balls in air;\r\nin the former case they were of very different size, here they were alike.\r\n\r\n1509. In future experiments intended to have the character of accuracy, the\r\ninfluence of these circumstances ought to be ascertained, and, above all\r\nthings, the gases themselves ought to be contained in vessels of metal, and\r\nnot of glass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1510. The next set of results are those obtained when the intervals _n_ and\r\n_o_ (fig. 131.) were made equal to each other, and relate to the greater\r\nfacility of discharge at the small ball, when rendered positive or negative\r\n(1493.).\r\n\r\n1511. In _air_, with the intervals = 0.4 of an inch, A and B being\r\ninductric and positive, discharge was nearly equal at _n_ and _o_; when A\r\nand B were inductric and negative, the discharge was mostly at _n_ by\r\nnegative brush. When the intervals were = 0.8 of an inch, with A and B\r\ninductric positively, all discharge was at _n_ by positive brush; with A\r\nand B inductric negatively, all the discharge was at _n_ by a negative\r\nbrush. It is doubtful, therefore, from these results, whether the negative\r\nball has any greater facility than the positive.\r\n\r\n1512. _Nitrogen._--Intervals _n_ and _o_ = 0.4 of an inch: A, B inductric\r\npositive, discharge at both intervals, most at _n_, by positive sparks; A,\r\nB inductric negative, discharge equal at _n_ and _o_. The intervals made =\r\n0.8 of an inch: A, B inductric positive, discharge all at _n_ by positive\r\nbrush; A, B inductric negative, discharge most at _o_ by positive brush. In\r\nthis gas, therefore, though the difference is not decisive, it would seem\r\nthat the positive small ball caused the most ready discharge.\r\n\r\n1513. _Oxygen._--Intervals _n_ and _o_ = 0.4 of an inch: A, B inductric\r\npositive, discharge nearly equal; inductric negative, discharge mostly at\r\n_n_ by negative brush. Made the intervals = 0.8 of an inch: A, B inductric\r\npositive, discharge both at _n_ and _o_; inductric negative, discharge all\r\nat _o_ by negative brush. So here the negative small ball seems to give the\r\nmost ready discharge.\r\n\r\n1514. _Hydrogen._--Intervals _n_ and _o_ = 0.4 of an inch: A, B inductric\r\npositive, discharge nearly equal: inductric negative, discharge mostly at\r\n_o_. Intervals = 0.8 of an inch: A and B inductric positive, discharge\r\nmostly at _n_, as positive brush; inductric negative, discharge mostly at\r\n_o_, as positive brush. Here the positive discharge seems most facile.\r\n\r\n1515. _Coal gas._--_n_ and _o_ = 0.4 of an inch: A, B inductric positive,\r\ndischarge nearly all at _o_ by negative spark: A, B inductric negative,\r\ndischarge nearly all at _n_ by negative spark. Intervals = 0.8 of an inch,\r\nand A, B inductric positive, discharge mostly at _o_ by negative brush: A,\r\nB inductric negative, discharge all at _n_ by negative brush. Here the\r\nnegative discharge most facile.\r\n\r\n1516. _Carbonic acid gas._--_n_ and _o_ = 0.1 of an inch: A, B inductric\r\npositive, discharge nearly all at _o_, or negative: A, B inductric\r\nnegative, discharge nearly all at _n_, or negative. Intervals = 0.8 of an\r\ninch: A, B inductric positive, discharge mostly at _o_, or negative. A, B\r\ninductric negative, discharge all at _n_, or negative. In this case the\r\nnegative had a decided advantage in facility of discharge.\r\n\r\n1517. Thus, if we may trust this form of experiment, the negative small\r\nball has a decided advantage in facilitating disruptive discharge over the\r\npositive small ball in some gases, as in carbonic acid gas and coal gas\r\n(1399.), whilst in others that conclusion seems more doubtful; and in\r\nothers, again, there seems a probability that the positive small ball may\r\nbe superior. All these results were obtained at very nearly the same\r\npressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1518. I made some experiments in these gases whilst in the air jar (fig.\r\n131.), as to the change from spark to brush, analogous to those in the open\r\nair already described (1486. 1487.). I will give, in a Table, the results\r\nas to when brush began to appear mingled with the spark; but the after\r\nresults were so varied, and the nature of the discharge in different gases\r\nso different, that to insert the results obtained without further\r\ninvestigation, would be of little use. At intervals less than those\r\nexpressed the discharge was always by spark.\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|               |                           |                           |\r\n|               |     Discharge between     |    Discharge between      |\r\n|               |       balls B and D.      |      balls A and C.       |\r\n|               |___________________________|___________________________|\r\n|               |             |             |             |             |\r\n|               | Small ball  | Small ball  | Large ball  | Large ball  |\r\n|               | B inductric | B inductric | A inductric | A inductric |\r\n|               |   _pos_.    |   _neg_.    |   _pos_.    |   _neg_.    |\r\n|_______________|_____________|_____________|_____________|_____________|\r\n|               |             |             |             |             |\r\n| Air           |     0.55    |    0.30     |    0.40     |     0.75    |\r\n| Nitrogen      |     0.30    |    0.40     |    0.52     |     0.41    |\r\n| Oxygen        |     0.70    |    0.30     |    0.45     |     0.82    |\r\n| Hydrogen      |     0.20    |    0.10     |             |             |\r\n| Coal gas      |     0.13    |    0.30     |    0.30     |     0.44    |\r\n| Carbonic acid |     0.82    |    0.43     |    1.60     | {above 1.80;|\r\n|               |             |             |             |   had not   |\r\n|               |             |             |             |   space.)   |\r\n|_______________|_____________|_____________|_____________|_____________|\r\n\r\n1519. It is to be understood that sparks occurred at much higher intervals\r\nthan these; the table only expresses that distance beneath which all\r\ndischarge was as spark. Some curious relations of the different gases to\r\ndischarge are already discernible, but it would be useless to consider them\r\nuntil illustrated by further experiments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1520. I ought not to omit noticing here, that Professor Belli of Milan has\r\npublished a very valuable set of experiments on the relative dissipation of\r\npositive and negative electricity in the air[A]; he finds the latter far\r\nmore ready, in this respect, than the former.\r\n\r\n  [A] Bibliothèque Universelle, 1836, September, p. 152.\r\n\r\n1521. I made some experiments of a similar kind, but with sustained high\r\ncharges; the results were less striking than those of Signore Belli, and I\r\ndid not consider them as satisfactory. I may be allowed to mention, in\r\nconnexion with the subject, an interfering effect which embarrassed me for\r\na long time. When I threw positive electricity from a given point into the\r\nair, a certain intensity was indicated by an electrometer on the conductor\r\nconnected with the point, but as the operation continued this intensity\r\nrose several degrees; then making the conductor negative with the same\r\npoint attached to it, and all other things remaining the same, a certain\r\ndegree of tension was observed in the first instance, which also gradually\r\nrose as the operation proceeded. Returning the conductor to the positive\r\nstate, the tension was at first low, but rose as before; and so also when\r\nagain made negative.\r\n\r\n1522. This result appeared to indicate that the point which had been giving\r\noff one electricity, was, by that, more fitted for a short time to give off\r\nthe other. But on closer examination I found the whole depended upon the\r\ninductive reaction of that air, which being charged by the point, and\r\ngradually increasing in quantity before it, as the positive or negative\r\nissue was continued, diverted and removed a part of the inductive action of\r\nthe surrounding wall, and thus apparently affected the powers of the point,\r\nwhilst really it was the dielectric itself that was causing the change of\r\ntension.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1523. The results connected with the different conditions of positive and\r\nnegative discharge will have a far greater influence on the philosophy of\r\nelectrical science than we at present imagine, especially if, as I believe,\r\nthey depend on the peculiarity and degree of polarized condition which the\r\nmolecules of the dielectrics concerned acquire (1503. 1600.). Thus, for\r\ninstance, the relation of our atmosphere and the earth within it, to the\r\noccurrence of spark or brush, must be especial and not accidental (1464.).\r\nIt would not else consist with other meteorological phenomena, also of\r\ncourse dependent on the special properties of the air, and which being\r\nthemselves in harmony the most perfect with the functions of animal and\r\nvegetable life, are yet restricted in their actions, not by loose\r\nregulations, but by laws the most precise.\r\n\r\n1524. Even in the passage through air of the voltaic current we see the\r\npeculiarities of positive and negative discharge at the two charcoal\r\npoints; and if these discharges are made to take place simultaneously to\r\nmercury, the distinction is still more remarkable, both as to the sound and\r\nthe quantity of vapour produced.\r\n\r\n1525. It seems very possible that the remarkable difference recently\r\nobserved and described by my friend Professor Daniell[A], namely, that when\r\na zinc and a copper ball, the same in size, were placed respectively in\r\ncopper and zinc spheres, also the same in size, and excited by electrolytes\r\nor dielectrics of the same strength and nature, the zinc ball far surpassed\r\nthe zinc sphere in action, may also be connected with these phenomena; for\r\nit is not difficult to conceive how the polarity of the particles shall be\r\naffected by the circumstance of the positive surface, namely the zinc,\r\nbeing the larger or the smaller of the two inclosing the electrolyte. It is\r\neven possible, that with different electrolytes or dielectrics the ratio\r\nmay be considerably varied, or in some cases even inverted.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1838, p. 47.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Glow discharge._\r\n\r\n1526. That form of disruptive discharge which appears as a _glow_ (1359.\r\n1405.), is very peculiar and beautiful: it seems to depend on a quick and\r\nalmost continuous charging of the air close to, and in contact with, the\r\nconductor.\r\n\r\n1527. _Diminution of the charging surface_ will produce it. Thus, when a\r\nrod 0.3 of an inch in diameter, with a rounded termination, was rendered\r\npositive in free air, it gave fine brushes from the extremity, but\r\noccasionally these disappeared, and a quiet phosphorescent continuous glow\r\ntook their place, covering the whole of the end of the wire, and extending\r\na very small distance from the metal into the air. With a rod 0.2 of an\r\ninch in diameter the glow was more readily produced. With still smaller\r\nrods, and also with blunt conical points, it occurred still more readily;\r\nand with a fine point I could not obtain the brush in free air, but only\r\nthis glow. The positive glow and the positive star are, in fact, the same.\r\n\r\n1528. _Increase of power in the machine_ tends to produce the glow; for\r\nrounded terminations which will give only brushes when the machine is in\r\nweak action, will readily give the glow when it is in good order.\r\n\r\n1529. _Rarefaction of the air_ wonderfully favours the glow phenomena. A\r\nbrass ball, two and a half inches in diameter, being made positively\r\ninductric in an air-pump receiver, became covered with glow over an area of\r\ntwo inches in diameter, when the pressure was reduced to 4.4 inches of\r\nmercury. By a little adjustment the ball could be covered all over with\r\nthis light. Using a brass ball 1.25 inches in diameter, and making it\r\ninducteously positive by an inductric negative point, the phenomena, at\r\nhigh degrees of rarefaction, were exceedingly beautiful. The glow came over\r\nthe positive ball, and gradually increased in brightness, until it was at\r\nlast very luminous; and it also stood up like a low flame, half an inch or\r\nmore in height. On touching the sides of the glass jar this lambent flame\r\nwas affected, assumed a ring form, like a crown on the top of the ball,\r\nappeared flexible, and revolved with a comparatively slow motion, i.e.\r\nabout four or five times in a second. This ring-shape and revolution are\r\nbeautifully connected with the mechanical currents (1576.) taking place\r\nwithin the receiver. These glows in rarefied air are often highly exalted\r\nin beauty by a spark discharge at the conductor (1551. _Note_.).\r\n\r\n1530. To obtain a _negative glow_ in air at common pressures is difficult.\r\nI did not procure it on the rod 0.3 of an inch in diameter by my machine,\r\nnor on much smaller rods; and it is questionable as yet, whether, even on\r\nfine points, what is called the negative star is a very reduced and minute,\r\nbut still intermitting brush, or a glow similar to that obtained on a\r\npositive point.\r\n\r\n1531. In rarefied air the negative glow can easily be obtained. If the\r\nrounded ends of two metal rods, about O.2 of an inch in diameter, are\r\nintroduced into a globe or jar (the air within being rarefied), and being\r\nopposite to each other, are about four inches apart, the glow can be\r\nobtained on both rods, covering not only the ends, but an inch or two of\r\nthe part behind. On using _balls_ in the air-pump jar, and adjusting the\r\ndistance and exhaustion, the negative ball could be covered with glow,\r\nwhether it were the inductric or the inducteous surface.\r\n\r\n1532. When rods are used it is necessary to be aware that, if placed\r\nconcentrically in the jar or globe, the light on one rod is often reflected\r\nby the sides of the vessel on to the other rod, and makes it apparently\r\nluminous, when really it is not so. This effect may be detected by shifting\r\nthe eye at the time of observation, or avoided by using blackened rods.\r\n\r\n1533. It is curious to observe the relation _of glow, brush_, and _spark_\r\nto each other, as produced by positive or negative surfaces; thus,\r\nbeginning with spark discharge, it passes into brush much sooner when the\r\nsurface at which the discharge commences (1484.) is negative, than it does\r\nwhen positive; but proceeding onwards in the order of change, we find that\r\nthe positive brush passes into _glow_ long before the negative brush does.\r\nSo that, though each presents the three conditions in the same general\r\norder, the series are not precisely the same. It is probable, that, when\r\nthese points are minutely examined, as they must be shortly, we shall find\r\nthat each different gas or dielectric presents its own peculiar results,\r\ndependent upon the mode in which its particles assume polar electric\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n1534. The glow occurs in all gases in which I have looked for it. These are\r\nair, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, coal gas, carbonic acid, muriatic acid,\r\nsulphurous acid and ammonia. I thought also that I obtained it in oil of\r\nturpentine, but if so it was very dull and small.\r\n\r\n1535. The glow is always accompanied by a wind proceeding either directly\r\nout from the glowing part, or directly towards it; the former being the\r\nmost general case. This takes place even when the glow occurs upon a ball\r\nof considerable size: and if matters be so arranged that the ready and\r\nregular access of air to a part exhibiting the glow be interfered with or\r\nprevented, the glow then disappears.\r\n\r\n1536. I have never been able to analyse or separate the glow into visible\r\nelementary intermitting discharges (1427. 1433.), nor to obtain the other\r\nevidence of intermitting action, namely an audible sound (1431.). The want\r\nof success, as respects trials made by ocular means, may depend upon the\r\nlarge size of the glow preventing the separation of the visible images:\r\nand, indeed, if it does intermit, it is not likely that all parts intermit\r\nat once with a simultaneous regularity.\r\n\r\n1537. All the effects tend to show, that _glow_ is due to a continuous\r\ncharge or discharge of air; in the former case being accompanied by a\r\ncurrent from, and in the latter by one to, the place of the glow. As the\r\nsurrounding air comes up to the charged conductor, on attaining that spot\r\nat which the tension of the particles is raised to the sufficient degree\r\n(1370. 1410.), it becomes charged, and then moves off, by the joint action\r\nof the forces to which it is subject; and, at the same time that it makes\r\nway for other particles to come and be charged in turn, actually helps to\r\nform that current by which they are brought into the necessary position.\r\nThus, through the regularity of the forces, a constant and quiet result is\r\nproduced; and that result is, the charging of successive portions of air,\r\nthe production of a current, and of a continuous glow.\r\n\r\n1538. I have frequently been able to make the termination of a rod, which,\r\nwhen left to itself, would produce a brush, produce in preference a glow,\r\nsimply by aiding the formation of a current of air at its extremity; and,\r\non the other hand, it is not at all difficult to convert the glow into\r\nbrushes, by affecting the current of air (1574. 1579.) or the inductive\r\naction near it.\r\n\r\n1539. The transition from glow, on the one hand, to brush and spark, on the\r\nother, and, therefore, their connexion, may be established in various ways.\r\nThose circumstances which tend to facilitate the charge of the air by the\r\nexcited conductor, and also those which tend to keep the tension at the\r\nsame degree notwithstanding the discharge, assist in producing the glow;\r\nwhereas those which tend to resist the charge of the air or other\r\ndielectric, and those which favour the accumulation of electric force prior\r\nto discharge, which, sinking by that act, has to be exalted before the\r\ntension can again acquire the requisite degree, favour intermitting\r\ndischarge, and, therefore, the production of brush or spark. Thus,\r\nrarefaction of the air, the removal of large conducting surfaces from the\r\nneighbourhood of the glowing termination, the presentation of a sharp point\r\ntowards it, help to sustain or produce the glow: but the condensation of\r\nthe air, the presentation of the hand or other large surface, the gradual\r\napproximation of a discharging ball, tend to convert the glow into brush or\r\neven spark. All these circumstances may be traced and reduced, in a manner\r\neasily comprehensible, to their relative power of assisting to produce,\r\neither a _continuous_ discharge to the air, which gives the glow; or an\r\n_interrupted_ one, which produces the brush, and, in a more exalted\r\ncondition, the spark.\r\n\r\n1540. The rounded end of a brass rod, 0.3 of an inch in diameter, was\r\ncovered with a positive glow by the working of an electrical machine: on\r\nstopping the machine, so that the charge of the connected conductor should\r\nfall, the glow changed for a moment into brushes just before the discharge\r\nceased altogether, illustrating the necessity for a certain high continuous\r\ncharge, for a certain sized termination. Working the machine so that the\r\nintensity should be just low enough to give continual brushes from the end\r\nin free air, the approach of a fine point changed these brushes into a\r\nglow. Working the machine so that the termination presented a continual\r\nglow in free air, the gradual approach of the hand caused the glow to\r\ncontract at the very end of the wire, then to throw out a luminous point,\r\nwhich, becoming a foot stalk (1426.), finally produced brushes with large\r\nramifications. All these results are in accordance with what is stated\r\nabove (1539.).\r\n\r\n1541. Greasing the end of a rounded wire will immediately make it produce\r\nbrushes instead of glow. A ball having a blunt point which can be made to\r\nproject more or less beyond its surface, at pleasure, can be made to\r\nproduce every gradation from glow, through brush, to spark.\r\n\r\n1542. It is also very interesting and instructive to trace the transition\r\nfrom spark to glow, through the intermediate condition of stream, between\r\nends in a vessel containing air more or less rarefied; but I fear to be\r\nprolix.\r\n\r\n1543. All the effects show, that the glow is in its nature exactly the same\r\nas the luminous part of a brush or ramification, namely a charging of air;\r\nthe only difference being, that the glow has a continuous appearance from\r\nthe constant renewal of the same action in the same place, whereas the\r\nramification is due to a momentary, independent and intermitting action of\r\nthe same kind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Dark discharge._\r\n\r\n1544. I will now notice a very remarkable circumstance in the luminous\r\ndischarge accompanied by negative glow, which may, perhaps, be correctly\r\ntraced hereafter into discharges of much higher intensity. Two brass rods,\r\n0.3 of an inch in diameter, entering a glass globe on opposite sides, had\r\ntheir ends brought into contact, and the air about them very much rarefied.\r\nA discharge of electricity from the machine was then made through them, and\r\nwhilst that was continued the ends were separated from each other. At the\r\nmoment of separation a continuous glow came over the end of the negative\r\nrod, the positive termination remaining quite dark. As the distance was\r\nincreased, a purple stream or haze appeared on the end of the positive rod,\r\nand proceeded directly outwards towards the negative rod; elongating as the\r\ninterval was enlarged, but never joining the negative glow, there being\r\nalways a short dark space between. This space, of about 1/16th or 1/20th of\r\nan inch, was apparently invariable in its extent and its position, relative\r\nto the negative rod; nor did the negative glow vary. Whether the negative\r\nend were inductric or inducteous, the same effect was produced. It was\r\nstrange to see the positive purple haze diminish or lengthen as the ends\r\nwere separated, and yet this dark space and the negative glow remain\r\nunaltered (fig. 133).\r\n\r\n1545. Two balls were then used in a large air-pump receiver, and the air\r\nrarefied. The usual transitions in the character of the discharge took\r\nplace; but whenever the luminous stream, which appears after the spark and\r\nthe brush have ceased, was itself changed into glow at the balls, the dark\r\nspace occurred, and that whether the one or the other ball was made\r\ninductric, or positive, or negative.\r\n\r\n1546. Sometimes when the negative ball was large, the machine in powerful\r\naction, and the rarefaction high, the ball would be covered over half its\r\nsurface with glow, and then, upon a hasty observation, would seem to\r\nexhibit no dark space: but this was a deception, arising from the\r\noverlapping of the convex termination of the negative glow and the concave\r\ntermination of the positive stream. More careful observation and experiment\r\nhave convinced me, that when the negative glow occurs, it never visibly\r\ntouches the luminous part of the positive discharge, but that the dark\r\nspace is always there.\r\n\r\n1547. This singular separation of the positive and negative discharge, as\r\nfar as concerns their luminous character, under circumstances which one\r\nwould have thought very favourable to their coalescence, is probably\r\nconnected with their differences when in the form of brush, and is perhaps\r\neven dependent on the same cause. Further, there is every likelihood that\r\nthe dark parts which occur in feeble sparks are also connected with these\r\nphenomena[A]. To understand them would be very important, for it is quite\r\nclear that in many of the experiments, indeed in all that I have quoted,\r\ndischarge is taking place across the dark part of the dielectric to an\r\nextent quite equal to what occurs in the luminous part. This difference in\r\nthe result would seem to imply a distinction in the modes by which the two\r\nelectric forces are brought into equilibrium in the respective parts; and\r\nlooking upon all the phenomena as giving additional proofs, that it is to\r\nthe condition of the particles of the dielectric we must refer for the\r\nprinciples of induction and discharge, so it would be of great importance\r\nif we could know accurately in what the difference of action in the dark\r\nand the luminous parts consisted.\r\n\r\n  [A] See Professor Johnson's experiments. Silliman's Journal, xxv. p. 57.\r\n\r\n1548. The dark discharge through air (1552.), which in the case mentioned\r\nis very evident (1544.), leads to the inquiry, whether the particles of air\r\nare generally capable of effecting discharge from one to another without\r\nbecoming luminous; and the inquiry is important, because it is connected\r\nwith that degree of tension which is necessary to originate discharge\r\n(1368. 1370.). Discharge between _air and conductors_ without luminous\r\nappearances are very common; and non-luminous discharges by carrying\r\ncurrents of air and other fluids (1562. 1595.) are also common enough: but\r\nthese are not cases in point, for they are not discharges between\r\ninsulating particles.\r\n\r\n1549. An arrangement was made for discharge between two balls (1485.) (fig.\r\n129.) but, in place of connecting the inducteous ball directly with the\r\ndischarging train, it was put in communication with the inside coating of a\r\nLeyden jar, and the discharging train with the outside coating. Then\r\nworking the machine, it was found that whenever sonorous and luminous\r\ndischarge occurred at the balls A B, the jar became charged; but that when\r\nthese did not occur, the jar acquired no charge: and such was the case when\r\nsmall rounded terminations were used in place of the balls, and also in\r\nwhatever manner they were arranged. Under these circumstances, therefore,\r\ndischarge even between the air and conductors was always luminous.\r\n\r\n1550. But in other cases, the phenomena are such as to make it almost\r\ncertain, that dark discharge can take place across air. If the rounded end\r\nof a metal rod, 0.15 of an inch in diameter, be made to give a good\r\nnegative brush, the approach of a smaller end or a blunt point opposite to\r\nit will, at a certain distance, cause a diminution of the brush, and a glow\r\nwill appear on the positive inducteous wire, accompanied by a current of\r\nair passing from it. Now, as the air is being charged both at the positive\r\nand negative surfaces, it seems a reasonable conclusion, that the charged\r\nportions meet somewhere in the interval, and there discharge to each other,\r\nwithout producing any luminous phenomena. It is possible, however, that the\r\nair electrified positively at the glowing end may travel on towards the\r\nnegative surface, and actually form that atmosphere into which the visible\r\nnegative brushes dart, in which case dark discharge need not, of necessity,\r\noccur. But I incline to the former opinion, and think, that the diminution\r\nin size of the negative brush, as the positive glow comes on to the end of\r\nthe opposed wire, is in favour of that view.\r\n\r\n1551. Using rarefied air as the dielectric, it is very easy to obtain\r\nluminous phenomena as brushes, or glow, upon both conducting balls or\r\nterminations, whilst the interval is dark, and that, when the action is so\r\nmomentary that I think we cannot consider currents as effecting discharge\r\nacross the dark part. Thus if two balls, about an inch in diameter, and 4\r\nor more inches apart, have the air rarefied about them, and are then\r\ninterposed in the course of discharge, an interrupted or spark current\r\nbeing produced at the machine[A], each termination may be made to show\r\nluminous phenomena, whilst more or less of the interval is quite dark. The\r\ndischarge will pass as suddenly as a retarded spark (295. 334.), i.e. in an\r\ninterval of time almost inappreciably small, and in such a case, I think it\r\nmust have passed across the dark part as true disruptive discharge, and not\r\nby convection.\r\n\r\n  [A] By spark current I mean one passing in a series of spark between\r\n  the conductor of the machine and the apparatus: by a continuous\r\n  current one that passes through metallic conductors, and in that\r\n  respect without interruption at the same place.\r\n\r\n1552. Hence I conclude that dark disruptive discharge may occur (1547.\r\n1550.); and also, that, in the luminous brush, the visible ramifications\r\nmay not show the full extent of the disruptive discharge (1444. 1452.), but\r\nthat each may have a dark outside, enveloping, as it were, every part\r\nthrough which the discharge extends. It is probable, even, that there are\r\nsuch things as dark discharges analogous in form to the brush and the\r\nspark, but not luminous in any part (1445.).\r\n\r\n1553. The occurrence of dark discharge in any case shows at how low a\r\ntension disruptive discharge may occur (1548,), and indicates that the\r\nlight of the ultimate brush or spark is in no relation to the intensity\r\nrequired (1368. 1370.). So to speak, the discharge begins in darkness, and\r\nthe light is a mere consequence of the quantity which, after discharge has\r\ncommenced, flows to that spot and there finds its most facile passage\r\n(1418. 1435.). As an illustration of the growth generally of discharge, I\r\nmay remark that, in the experiments on the transition in oxygen of the\r\ndischarge from spark to brush (1518.), every spark was immediately preceded\r\nby a short brush.\r\n\r\n1554. The phenomena relative to dark discharge in other gases, though\r\ndiffering in certain characters from those in air, confirm the conclusions\r\ndrawn above. The two rounded terminations (1544.) (fig. 133.), were placed\r\nin _muriatic acid gas_ (1445. 1463.) at the pressure of 6.5 inches of\r\nmercury, and a continuous machine current of electricity sent through the\r\napparatus: bright sparks occurred until the interval was about or above an\r\ninch, when they were replaced by squat brushy intermitting glows upon both\r\nterminations, with a dark part between. When the current at the machine was\r\nin spark, then each spark caused a discharge across the muriatic acid gas,\r\nwhich, with a certain interval, was bright; with a larger interval, was\r\nstraight across and flamy, like a very exhausted and sudden, but not a\r\ndense sharp spark; and with a still larger interval, produced a feeble\r\nbrush on the inductric positive end, and a glow on the inducteous negative\r\nend, the dark part being between (1544.); and at such times, the spark at\r\nthe conductor, instead of being sudden and sonorous, was dull and quiet\r\n(334.).\r\n\r\n1555. On introducing more muriatic acid gas, until the pressure was 29.97\r\ninches, the same terminations gave bright sparks within at small distances;\r\nbut when they were about an inch or more apart, the discharge was generally\r\nwith very small brushes and glow, and frequently with no light at all,\r\nthough electricity had passed through the gas. Whenever the bright spark\r\ndid pass through the muriatic acid gas at this pressure, it was bright\r\nthroughout, presenting no dark or dull space.\r\n\r\n1556. In _coal gas_, at common pressures, when the distance was about an\r\ninch, the discharge was accompanied by short brushes on the ends, and a\r\ndark interval of half an inch or more between them, notwithstanding the\r\ndischarge had the sharp quick sound of a dull spark, and could not have\r\ndepended in the dark part on _convection_ (1562.).\r\n\r\n1557. This gas presents several curious points in relation to the bright\r\nand dark parts of spark discharge. When bright sparks passed between the\r\nrod ends 0.3 of an inch in diameter (1544.), very sudden dark parts would\r\noccur next to the brightest portions of the spark. Again with these ends\r\nand also with balls (1422.), the bright sparks would be sometimes red,\r\nsometimes green, and occasionally green and red in different parts of the\r\nsame spark. Again, in the experiments described (1518.), at certain\r\nintervals a very peculiar pale, dull, yet sudden discharge would pass,\r\nwhich, though apparently weak, was very direct in its course, and\r\naccompanied by a sharp snapping noise, as if quick in its occurrence.\r\n\r\n1558. _Hydrogen_ frequently gave peculiar sparks, one part being bright\r\nred, whilst the other was a dull pale gray, or else the whole spark was\r\ndull and peculiar.\r\n\r\n1559. _Nitrogen_ presents a very remarkable discharge, between two balls of\r\nthe respective diameters of 0.15 and 2 inches (1506. 1518.), the smaller\r\none being rendered negative either directly inducteously. The peculiar\r\ndischarge occurs at intervals between 0.42 and 0.68, and even at 1.4 inches\r\nwhen the large ball was inductric positively; it consisted of a little\r\nbrushy part on the small negative ball, then a dark space, and lastly a\r\ndull straight line on the large positive ball (fig. 134.). The position of\r\nthe dark space was very constant, and is probably in direct relation to the\r\ndark space described when negative glow was produced (1544.). When by any\r\ncircumstance a bright spark was determined, the contrast with the peculiar\r\nspark described was very striking; for it always had a faint purple part,\r\nbut the place of this part was constantly near the positive ball.\r\n\r\n1560. Thus dark discharge appears to be decidedly established. But its\r\nestablishment is accompanied by proofs that it occurs in different degrees\r\nand modes in different gases. Hence then another specific action, added to\r\nthe many (1296. 1398. 1399. 1423. 1454. 1503.) by which the electrical\r\nrelations of insulating dielectrics are distinguished and established, and\r\nanother argument in favour of that molecular theory of induction, which is\r\nat present under examination[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] I cannot resist referring here by a note to Biot's philosophical\r\n  view of the nature of the light of the electric discharge, Annales de\r\n  Chimie, liii. p. 321.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1561. What I have had to say regarding disruptive discharge has extended to\r\nsome length, but I hope will be excused in consequence of the importance of\r\nthe subject. Before concluding my remarks, I will again intimate in the\r\nform of a query, whether we have not reason to consider the tension or\r\nretention and after discharge in air or other insulating dielectrics, as\r\nthe same thing with retardation and discharge in a metal wire, differing\r\nonly, but almost infinitely, in degree (1334. 1336.). In other words, can\r\nwe not, by a gradual chain of association, carry up discharge from its\r\noccurrence in air, through spermaceti and water, to solutions, and then on\r\nto chlorides, oxides and metals, without any essential change in its\r\ncharacter; and, at the same time, connecting the insensible conduction of\r\nair, through muriatic acid gas and the dark discharge, with the better\r\nconduction of spermaceti, water, and the all but perfect conduction of the\r\nmetals, associate the phenomena at both extremes? and may it not be, that\r\nthe retardation and ignition of a wire are effects exactly correspondent in\r\ntheir nature to the retention of charge and spark in air? If so, here again\r\nthe two extremes in property amongst dielectrics will be found to be in\r\nintimate relation, the whole difference probably depending upon the mode\r\nand degree in which their particles polarize under the influence of\r\ninductive actions (1338. 1603. 1610.).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n¶ x. _Convection, or carrying discharge._\r\n\r\n1562. The last kind of discharge which I have to consider is that effected\r\nby the motion of charged particles from place to place. It is apparently\r\nvery different in its nature to any of the former modes of discharge\r\n(1319.), but, as the result is the same, may be of great importance in\r\nillustrating, not merely the nature of discharge itself, but also of what\r\nwe call the electric current. It often, as before observed, in cases of\r\nbrush and glow (1440. 1535.), joins its effect to that of disruptive\r\ndischarge, to complete the act of neutralization amongst the electric\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n1563. The particles which being charged, then travel, may be either of\r\ninsulating or conducting matter, large or small. The consideration in the\r\nfirst place of a large particle of conducting matter may perhaps help our\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\n1564. A copper boiler 3 feet in diameter was insulated and electrified, but\r\nso feebly, that dissipation by brushes or disruptive discharge did not\r\noccur at its edges or projecting parts in a sensible degree. A brass ball,\r\n2 inches in diameter, suspended by a clean white silk thread, was brought\r\ntowards it, and it was found that, if the ball was held for a second or two\r\nnear any part of the charged surface of the boiler, at such distance (two\r\ninches more or less) as not to receive any direct charge from it, it became\r\nitself charged, although insulated the whole time; and its electricity was\r\nthe _reverse_ of that of the boiler.\r\n\r\n1565. This effect was the strongest opposite the edges and projecting parts\r\nof the boiler, and weaker opposite the sides, or those extended portions of\r\nthe surface which, according to Coulomb's results, have the weakest charge.\r\nIt was very strong opposite a rod projecting a little way from the boiler.\r\nIt occurred when the copper was charged negatively as well as positively:\r\nit was produced also with small balls down to 0.2 of an inch and less in\r\ndiameter, and also with smaller charged conductors than the copper. It is,\r\nindeed, hardly possible in some cases to carry an insulated ball within an\r\ninch or two of a charged plane or convex surface without its receiving a\r\ncharge of the contrary kind to that of the surface.\r\n\r\n1566. This effect is one of induction between the bodies, not of\r\ncommunication. The ball, when related to the positive charged surface by\r\nthe intervening dielectric, has its opposite sides brought into contrary\r\nstates, that side towards the boiler being negative and the outer side\r\npositive. More inductric action is directed towards it than would have\r\npassed across the same place if the ball had not been there, for several\r\nreasons; amongst others, because, being a conductor, the resistance of the\r\nparticles of the dielectric, which otherwise would have been there, is\r\nremoved (1298.); and also, because the reacting positive surface of the\r\nball being projected further out from the boiler than when there is no\r\nintroduction of conducting matter, is more free therefore to act through\r\nthe rest of the dielectric towards surrounding conductors, and so favours\r\nthe exaltation of that inductric polarity which is directed in its course.\r\nIt is, as to the exaltation of force upon its outer surface beyond that\r\nupon the inductric surface of the boiler, as if the latter were itself\r\nprotuberant in that direction. Thus it acquires a state like, but higher\r\nthan, that of the surface of the boiler which causes it; and sufficiently\r\nexalted to discharge at its positive surface to the air, or to affect small\r\nparticles, as it is itself affected by the boiler, and they flying to it,\r\ntake a charge and pass off; and so the ball, as a whole, is brought into\r\nthe contrary inducteous state. The consequence is, that, if free to move,\r\nits tendency, under the influence of all the forces, to approach the boiler\r\nis increased, whilst it at the same time becomes more and more exalted in\r\nits condition, both of polarity and charge, until, at a certain distance,\r\ndischarge takes place, it acquires the same state as the boiler, is\r\nrepelled, and passing to that conductor most favourably circumstanced to\r\ndischarge it, there resumes its first indifferent condition.\r\n\r\n1567. It seems to me, that the manner in which inductric bodies affect\r\nuncharged floating or moveable conductors near them, is very frequently of\r\nthis nature, and generally so when it ends in a carrying operation (1562.\r\n1602.). The manner in which, whilst the dominant inductric body cannot give\r\noff its electricity to the air, the inducteous body _can_ effect the\r\ndischarge of the same kind of force, is curious, and, in the case of\r\nelongated or irregularly shaped conductors, such as filaments or particles\r\nof dust, the effect will often be very ready, and the consequent attraction\r\nimmediate.\r\n\r\n1568. The effect described is also probably influential in causing those\r\nvariations in spark discharge referred to in the last series (1386. 1390.\r\n1391.): for if a particle of dust were drawn towards the axis of induction\r\nbetween the balls, it would tend, whilst at some distance from that axis,\r\nto commence discharge at itself, in the manner described (1566.), and that\r\ncommencement might so far facilitate the act (1417. 1420.) as to make the\r\ncomplete discharge, as spark, pass through the particle, though it might\r\nnot be the shortest course from ball to ball. So also, with equal balls at\r\nequal distances, as in the experiments of comparison already described\r\n(1493. 1506.), a particle being between one pair of balls would cause\r\ndischarge there in preference; or even if a particle were between each,\r\ndifference of size or shape would give one for the time a predominance over\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n1569. The power of particles of dust to carry off electricity in cases of\r\nhigh tension is well known, and I have already mentioned some instances of\r\nthe kind in the use of the inductive apparatus (1201.). The general\r\noperation is very well shown by large light objects, as the toy called the\r\nelectrical spider; or, if smaller ones are wanted for philosophical\r\ninvestigation, by the smoke of a glowing green wax taper, which, presenting\r\na successive stream of such particles, makes their course visible.\r\n\r\n1570. On using oil of turpentine as the dielectric, the action and course\r\nof small conducting carrying particles in it can be well observed. A few\r\nshort pieces of thread will supply the place of carriers, and their\r\nprogressive action is exceedingly interesting.\r\n\r\n1571. A very striking effect was produced on oil of turpentine, which,\r\nwhether it was due to the carrying power of the particles in it, or to any\r\nother action of them, is perhaps as yet doubtful. A portion of that fluid\r\nin a glass vessel had a large uninsulated silver dish at the bottom, and an\r\nelectrified metal rod with a round termination dipping into it at the top.\r\nThe insulation was very good, and the attraction and other phenomena\r\nstriking. The rod end, with a drop of gum water attached to it, was then\r\nelectrified in the fluid; the gum water soon spun off in fine threads, and\r\nwas quickly dissipated through the oil of turpentine. By the time that four\r\ndrops had in this way been commingled with a pint of the dielectric, the\r\nlatter had lost by far the greatest portion of its insulating power; no\r\nsparks could be obtained in the fluid; and all the phenomena dependent upon\r\ninsulation had sunk to a low degree. The fluid was very slightly turbid.\r\nUpon being filtered through paper only, it resumed its first clearness, and\r\nnow insulated as well as before. The water, therefore, was merely diffused\r\nthrough the oil of turpentine, not combined with or dissolved in it: but\r\nwhether the minute particles acted as carriers, or whether they were not\r\nrather gathered together in the line of highest inductive tension (1350.),\r\nand there, being drawn into elongated forms by the electric forces,\r\ncombined their effects to produce a band of matter having considerable\r\nconducting power, as compared with the oil of turpentine, is as yet\r\nquestionable.\r\n\r\n1572. The analogy between the action of solid conducting carrying particles\r\nand that of the charged particles of fluid insulating substances, acting as\r\ndielectrics, is very evident and simple; but in the latter case the result\r\nis, necessarily, currents in the mobile media. Particles are brought by\r\ninductric action into a polar state; and the latter, after rising to a\r\ncertain tension (1370.), is followed by the communication of a part of the\r\nforce originally on the conductor; the particles consequently become\r\ncharged, and then, under the joint influence of the repellent and\r\nattractive forces, are urged towards a discharging place, or to that spot\r\nwhere these inductric forces are most easily compensated by the contrary\r\ninducteous forces.\r\n\r\n1573. Why a point should be so exceedingly favourable to the production of\r\ncurrents in a fluid insulating dielectric, as air, is very evident. It is\r\nat the extremity of the point that the intensity necessary to charge the\r\nair is first acquired (1374.); it is from thence that the charged particle\r\nrecedes; and the mechanical force which it impresses on the air to form a\r\ncurrent is in every way favoured by the shape and position of the rod, of\r\nwhich the point forms the termination. At the same time, the point, having\r\nbecome the origin of an active mechanical force, does, by the very act of\r\ncausing that force, namely, by discharge, prevent any other part of the rod\r\nfrom acquiring the same necessary condition, and so preserves and sustains\r\nits own predominance.\r\n\r\n1574. The very varied and beautiful phenomena produced by sheltering or\r\nenclosing the point, illustrate the production of the current exceedingly\r\nwell, and justify the same conclusions; it being remembered that in such\r\ncases the effect upon the discharge is of two kinds. For the current may be\r\ninterfered with by stopping the access of fresh uncharged air, or retarding\r\nthe removal of that which has been charged, as when a point is electrified\r\nin a tube of insulating matter closed at one extremity; or the _electric\r\ncondition_ of the point itself may be altered by the relation of other\r\nparts in its neighbourhood, also rendered electric, as when the point is in\r\na metal tube, by the metal itself, or when it is in the glass tube, by a\r\nsimilar action of the charged parts of the glass, or even by the\r\nsurrounding air which has been charged, and which cannot escape.\r\n\r\n1575. Whenever it is intended to observe such inductive phenomena in a\r\nfluid dielectric as have a direct relation to, and dependence upon, the\r\nfluidity of the medium, such, for instance, as discharge from points, or\r\nattractions and repulsions, &c., then the mass of the fluid should be\r\ngreat, and in such proportion to the distance between the inductric and\r\ninducteous surfaces as to include all the _lines of inductive force_\r\n(1369.) between them; otherwise, the effects of currents, attraction, &c.,\r\nwhich are the resultants of all these forces, cannot be obtained. The\r\nphenomena, which occur in the open air, or in the middle of a globe filled\r\nwith oil of turpentine, will not take place in the same media if confined\r\nin tubes of glass, shell-lac, sulphur, or other such substances, though\r\nthey be excellent insulating dielectrics; nor can they be expected: for in\r\nsuch cases, the polar forces, instead of being all dispersed amongst fluid\r\nparticles, which tend to move under their influence, are now associated in\r\nmany parts with particles that, notwithstanding their tendency to motion,\r\nare constrained by their solidity to remain quiescent.\r\n\r\n1576. The varied circumstances under which, with conductors differently\r\nformed and constituted, currents can occur, all illustrate the same\r\nsimplicity of production. A _ball_, if the intensity be raised sufficiently\r\non its surface, and that intensity be greatest on a part consistent with\r\nthe production of a current of air up to and off from it, will produce the\r\neffect like a point (1537); such is the case whenever the glow occurs upon\r\na ball, the current being essential to that phenomenon. If as large a\r\nsphere as can well be employed with the production of glow be used, the\r\nglow will appear at the place where the current leaves the ball, and that\r\nwill be the part directly opposite to the connection of the ball and rod\r\nwhich supports it; but by increasing the tension elsewhere, so as to raise\r\nit above the tension upon that spot, which can easily be effected\r\ninductively, then the place of the glow and the direction of the current\r\nwill also change, and pass to that spot which for the time is most\r\nfavourable for their production (1591.).\r\n\r\n1577. For instance, approaching the hand towards the ball will tend to\r\ncause brush (1539.), but by increasing the supply of electricity the\r\ncondition of glow may be preserved; then on moving the hand about from side\r\nto side the position of the glow will very evidently move with it.\r\n\r\n1578. A point brought towards a glowing ball would at twelve or fourteen\r\ninches distance make the glow break into brush, but when still nearer, glow\r\nwas reproduced, probably dependent upon the discharge of wind or air\r\npassing from the point to the ball, and this glow was very obedient to the\r\nmotion of the point, following it in every direction.\r\n\r\n1579. Even a current of wind could affect the place of the glow; for a\r\nvarnished glass tube being directed sideways towards the ball, air was\r\nsometimes blown through it at the ball and sometimes not. In the former\r\ncase, the place of the glow was changed a little, as if it were blown away\r\nby the current, and this is just the result which might have been\r\nanticipated. All these effects illustrate beautifully the general causes\r\nand relations, both of the glow and the current of air accompanying it\r\n(1574.).\r\n\r\n1580. Flame facilitates the production of a current in the dielectric\r\nsurrounding it. Thus, if a ball which would not occasion a current in the\r\nair have a flame, whether large or small, formed on its surface, the\r\ncurrent is produced with the greatest ease; but not the least difficulty\r\ncan occur in comprehending the effective action of the flame in this case,\r\nif its relation, as part of the surrounding dielectric, to the electrified\r\nball, be but for a moment considered (1375. 1380.).\r\n\r\n1581. Conducting fluid terminations, instead of rigid points, illustrate in\r\na very beautiful manner the formation of the currents, with their effects\r\nand influence in exalting the conditions under which they were commenced.\r\nLet the rounded end of a brass rod, 0.3 of an inch or thereabouts in\r\ndiameter, point downwards in free air; let it be amalgamated, and have a\r\ndrop of mercury suspended from it; and then let it be powerfully\r\nelectrized. The mercury will present the phenomenon of _glow_; a current of\r\nair will rush along the rod, and set off from the mercury directly\r\ndownwards; and the form of the metallic drop will be slightly affected, the\r\nconvexity at a small part near the middle and lower part becoming greater,\r\nwhilst it diminishes all round at places a little removed from this spot.\r\nThe change is from the form of _a_ (fig. 135.) to that of _b_, and is due\r\nalmost, if not entirely, to the mechanical force of the current of air\r\nsweeping over its surface.\r\n\r\n1582. As a comparative observation, let it be noticed, that a ball\r\ngradually brought towards it converts the glow into brushes, and ultimately\r\nsparks pass from the most projecting part of the mercury. A point does the\r\nsame, but at much smaller distances.\r\n\r\n1583. Take next a drop of strong solution of muriate of lime; being\r\nelectrified, a part will probably be dissipated, but a considerable\r\nportion, if the electricity be not too powerful, will remain, forming a\r\nconical drop (fig. 136.), accompanied by a strong current. If glow be\r\nproduced, the drop will be smooth on the surface. If a short low brush is\r\nformed, a minute tremulous motion of the liquid will be visible; but both\r\neffects coincide with the principal one to be observed, namely, the regular\r\nand successive charge of air, the formation of a wind or current, and the\r\nform given by that current to the fluid drop, if a discharge ball be\r\ngradually brought toward the cone, sparks will at last pass, and these will\r\nbe from the apex of the cone to the approached ball, indicating a\r\nconsiderable degree of conducting power in this fluid.\r\n\r\n1584. With a drop of water, the effects were of the same kind, and were\r\nbest obtained when a portion of gum water or of syrup hung from a ball\r\n(fig. 137.). When the machine was worked slowly, a fine large quiet conical\r\ndrop, with concave lateral outline, and a small rounded end, was produced,\r\non which the glow appeared, whilst a steady wind issued, in a direction\r\nfrom the point of the cone, of sufficient force to depress the surface of\r\nuninsulated water held opposite to the termination. When the machine was\r\nworked more rapidly some of the water was driven off; the smaller pointed\r\nportion left was roughish on the surface, and the sound of successive brush\r\ndischarges was heard. With still more electricity, more water was\r\ndispersed; that which remained was elongated and contracted, with an\r\nalternating motion; a stronger brush discharge was heard, and the\r\nvibrations of the water and the successive discharges of the individual\r\nbrushes were simultaneous. When water from beneath was brought towards the\r\ndrop, it did not indicate the same regular strong contracted current of air\r\nas before; and when the distance was such that sparks passed, the water\r\nbeneath was _attracted_ rather than driven away, and the current of air\r\n_ceased_.\r\n\r\n1585. When the discharging ball was brought near the drop in its first\r\nquiet glowing state (1582.), it converted that glow into brushes, and\r\ncaused the vibrating motion of the drop. When still nearer, sparks passed,\r\nbut they were always from the metal of the rod, over the surface of the\r\nwater, to the point, and then across the air to the ball. This is a natural\r\nconsequence of the deficient conducting power of the fluid (1584. 1585.).\r\n\r\n1586. Why the drop vibrated, changing its form between the periods of\r\ndischarging brushes, so as to be more or less acute at particular instants,\r\nto be most acute when the brush issued forth, and to be isochronous in its\r\naction, and how the quiet glowing liquid drop, on assuming the conical\r\nform, facilitated, as it were, the first action, are points, as to theory,\r\nso evident, that I will not stop to speak of them. The principal thing to\r\nobserve at present is, the formation of the carrying current of air, and\r\nthe manner in which it exhibits its existence and influence by giving form\r\nto the drop.\r\n\r\n1587. That the drop, when of water, or a better conductor than water, is\r\nformed into a cone principally by the current of air, is shown amongst\r\nother ways (1594.) thus. A sharp point being held opposite the conical\r\ndrop, the latter soon lost its pointed form; was retraced and became round;\r\nthe current of air from it ceased, and was replaced by one from the point\r\nbeneath, which, if the latter were held near enough to the drop, actually\r\nblew it aside, and rendered it concave in form.\r\n\r\n1588. It is hardly necessary to say what happened with still worse\r\nconductors than water, as oil, or oil of turpentine; the fluid itself was\r\nthen spun out into threads and carried off, not only because the air\r\nrushing over its surface helped to sweep it away, but also because its\r\ninsulating particles assumed the same charged state as the particles of\r\nair, and, not being able to discharge to them in a much greater decree than\r\nthe air particles themselves could do, were carried off by the same causes\r\nwhich urged those in their course. A similar effect with melted sealing-wax\r\non a metal point forms an old and well-known experiment.\r\n\r\n1589. A drop of gum water in the exhausted receiver of the air-pump was not\r\nsensibly affected in its form when electrified. When air was let in, it\r\nbegun to show change of shape when the pressure was ten inches of mercury.\r\nAt the pressure of fourteen or fifteen inches the change was more sensible,\r\nand as the air increased in density the effects increased, until they were\r\nthe same as those in the open atmosphere. The diminished effect in the rare\r\nair I refer to the relative diminished energy of its current; that\r\ndiminution depending, in the first place, on the lower electric condition\r\nof the electrified ball in the rarefied medium, and in the next, on the\r\nattenuated condition of the dielectric, the cohesive force of water in\r\nrelation to rarefied air being something like that of mercury to dense air\r\n(1581.), whilst that of water in dense air may be compared to that of\r\nmercury in oil of turpentine (1597.).\r\n\r\n1590. When a ball is covered with a thick conducting fluid, as treacle or\r\nsyrup, it is easy by inductive action to determine the wind from almost any\r\npart of it (1577.); the experiment, which before was of rather difficult\r\nperformance, being rendered facile in consequence of the fluid enabling\r\nthat part, which at first was feeble in its action, to rise into an exalted\r\ncondition by assuming a pointed form.\r\n\r\n1591. To produce the current, the electric intensity must rise and continue\r\nat _one spot_, namely, at the origin of the current, higher than elsewhere,\r\nand then, air having a uniform and ready access, the current is produced.\r\nIf no current be allowed (1574.), then discharge may take place by brush or\r\nspark. But whether it be by brush or spark, or wind, it seems very probable\r\nthat the initial intensity or tension at which a particle of a given\r\ngaseous dielectric charges, or commences discharge, is, under the\r\nconditions before expressed, always the same (1410.).\r\n\r\n1592. It is not supposed that all the air which enters into motion is\r\nelectrified; on the contrary, much that is not charged is carried on into\r\nthe stream. The part which is really charged may be but a small proportion\r\nof that which is ultimately set in motion (1442.).\r\n\r\n\r\n1593. When a drop of gum water (1584.) is made _negative_, it presents a\r\nlarger cone than when made positive; less of the fluid is thrown off, and\r\nyet, when a ball is approached, sparks can hardly be obtained, so pointed\r\nis the cone, and so free the discharge. A point held opposite to it did not\r\ncause the retraction of the cone to such an extent as when it was positive.\r\nAll the effects are so different from those presented by the positive cone,\r\nthat I have no doubt such drops would present a very instructive method of\r\ninvestigating the difference of positive and negative discharge in air and\r\nother dielectrics (1480. 1501.).\r\n\r\n1594. That I may not be misunderstood (1587.), I must observe here that I\r\ndo not consider the cones produced as the result _only_ of the current of\r\nair or other insulating dielectric over their surface. When the drop is of\r\nbadly conducting matter, a part of the effect is due to the electrified\r\nstate of the particles, and this part constitutes almost the whole when the\r\nmatter is melted sealing-wax, oil of turpentine, and similar insulating\r\nbodies (1588.). But even when the drop is of good conducting matter, as\r\nwater, solutions, or mercury, though the effect above spoken of will then\r\nbe insensible (1607.), still it is not the mere current of air or other\r\ndielectric which produces all the change of form; for a part is due to\r\nthose attractive forces by which the charged drop, if free to move, would\r\ntravel along the line of strongest induction, and not being free to move,\r\nhas its form elongated until the _sum_ of the different forces tending to\r\nproduce this form is balanced by the cohesive attraction of the fluid. The\r\neffect of the attractive forces are well shown when treacle, gum water, or\r\nsyrup is used; for the long threads which spin out, at the same time that\r\nthey form the axes of the currents of air, which may still be considered as\r\ndetermined at their points, are like flexible conductors, and show by their\r\ndirections in what way the attractive forces draw them.\r\n\r\n1595. When the phenomena of currents are observed in dense insulating\r\ndielectrics, they present us with extraordinary degrees of mechanical\r\nforce. Thus, if a pint of well-rectified and filtered (1571.) oil of\r\nturpentine be put into a glass vessel, and two wires be dipped into it in\r\ndifferent places, one leading to the electrical machine, and the other to\r\nthe discharging train, on working the machine the fluid will be thrown into\r\nviolent motion throughout its whole mass, whilst at the same time it will\r\nrise two, three or four inches up the machine wire, and dart off jets from\r\nit into the air.\r\n\r\n1596. If very clean uninsulated mercury be at the bottom of the fluid, and\r\nthe wire from the machine be terminated either by a ball or a point, and\r\nalso pass through a glass tube extending both above and below the surface\r\nof the oil of turpentine, the currents can be better observed, and will be\r\nseen to rush down the wire, proceeding directly from it towards the\r\nmercury, and there, diverging in all directions, will ripple its surface\r\nstrongly, and mounting up at the sides of the vessel, will return to\r\nre-enter upon their course.\r\n\r\n1597. A drop of mercury being suspended from an amalgamated brass ball,\r\npreserved its form almost unchanged in air (1581.); but when immersed in\r\nthe oil of turpentine it became very pointed, and even particles of the\r\nmetal could be spun out and carried off by the currents of the dielectric.\r\nThe form of the liquid metal was just like that of the syrup in air\r\n(1584.), the point of the cone being quite as fine, though not so long. By\r\nbringing a sharp uninsulated point towards it, it could also be effected in\r\nthe same manner as the syrup drop in air (1587.), though not so readily,\r\nbecause of the density and limited quantity of the dielectric.\r\n\r\n1598. If the mercury at the bottom of the fluid be connected with the\r\nelectrical machine, whilst a rod is held in the hand terminating in a ball\r\nthree quarters of an inch, less or more, in diameter, and the ball be\r\ndipped into the electrified fluid, very striking appearances ensue. When\r\nthe ball is raised again so as to be at a level nearly out of the fluid,\r\nlarge portions of the latter will seem to cling to it (fig. 138.). If it be\r\nraised higher, a column of the oil of turpentine will still connect it with\r\nthat in the basin below (fig. 139.). If the machine be excited into more\r\npowerful action, this will become more bulky, and may then also be raised\r\nhigher, assuming the form (fig. 140); and all the time that these effects\r\ncontinue, currents and counter-currents, sometimes running very close\r\ntogether, may be observed in the raised column of fluid.\r\n\r\n1599. It is very difficult to decide by sight the direction of the currents\r\nin such experiments as these. If particles of silk are introduced they\r\ncling about the conductors; but using drops of water and mercury the course\r\nof the fluid dielectric seems well indicated. Thus, if a drop of water be\r\nplaced at the end of a rod (1571.) over the uninsulated mercury, it is soon\r\nswept away in particles streaming downwards towards the mercury. If another\r\ndrop be placed on the mercury beneath the end of the rod, it is quickly\r\ndispersed in all directions in the form of streaming particles, the\r\nattractive forces drawing it into elongated portions, and the currents\r\ncarrying them away. If a drop of mercury be hung from a ball used to raise\r\na column of the fluid (1598.), then the shape of the drop seems to show\r\ncurrents travelling in the fluid in the direction indicated by the arrows\r\n(fig. 141.).\r\n\r\n1600. A very remarkable effect is produced on these phenomena, connected\r\nwith positive and negative charge and discharge, namely, that a ball\r\ncharged positively raises a much higher and larger column of the oil of\r\nturpentine than when charged negatively. There can be no doubt that this is\r\nconnected with the difference of positive and negative action already\r\nspoken of (1480. 1525.), and tends much to strengthen the idea that such\r\ndifference is referable to the particles of the dielectric rather than to\r\nthe charged conductors, and is dependent upon the mode in which these\r\nparticles polarize (1503. 1523.).\r\n\r\n1601. Whenever currents travel in insulating dielectrics they really effect\r\ndischarge; and it is important to observe, though a very natural result,\r\nthat it is indifferent which way the current or particles travel, as with\r\nreversed direction their state is reversed. The change is easily made,\r\neither in air or oil of turpentine, between two opposed rods, for an\r\ninsulated ball being placed in connexion with either rod and brought near\r\nits extremity, will cause the current to set towards it from the opposite\r\nend.\r\n\r\n1602. The two currents often occur at once, as when both terminations\r\npresent brushes, and frequently when they exhibit the glow (1531.). In such\r\ncases, the charged particles, or many of them, meet and mutually discharge\r\neach other (1518. 1612.). If a smoking wax taper be held at the end of an\r\ninsulating rod towards a charged prime conductor, it will very often happen\r\nthat two currents will form, and be rendered visible by its vapour, one\r\npassing as a fine filament of smoky particles directly to the charged\r\nconductor, and the other passing as directly from the same taper wick\r\noutwards, and from the conductor: the principles of inductric action and\r\ncharge, which were referred to in considering the relation of a carrier\r\nball and a conductor (1566.), being here also called into play.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1603. The general analogy and, I think I may say, identity of action found\r\nto exist as to insulation and conduction (1338. 1561.) when bodies, the\r\nbest and the worst in the classes of insulators or conductors, were\r\ncompared, led me to believe that the phenomena of _convection_ in badly\r\nconducting media were not without their parallel amongst the best\r\nconductors, such even as the metals. Upon consideration, the cones produced\r\nby Davy[A] in fluid metals, as mercury and tin, seemed to be cases in\r\npoint, and probably also the elongation of the metallic medium through\r\nwhich a current of electricity was passing, described by Ampère (1113)[B];\r\nfor it is not difficult to conceive, that the diminution of convective\r\neffect, consequent upon the high conducting power of the metallic media\r\nused in these experiments, might be fully compensated for by the enormous\r\nquantity of electricity passing. In fact, it is impossible not to expect\r\n_some_ effect, whether sensible or not, of the kind in question, when such\r\na current is passing through a fluid offering a sensible resistance to the\r\npassage of the electricity, and, thereby, giving proof of a certain degree\r\nof insulating power (1328.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1823, p. 155.\r\n\r\n  [B] Bibliothèque Universelle, xxi, 417.\r\n\r\n1604. I endeavoured to connect the convective currents in air, oil of\r\nturpentine, &c. and those in metals, by intermediate cases, but found this\r\nnot easy to do. On taking bodies, for instance, which, like water, adds,\r\nsolutions, fused salts or chlorides, &c., have intermediate conducting\r\npowers, the minute quantity of electricity which the common machine can\r\nsupply (371. 861.) is exhausted instantly, so that the cause of the\r\nphenomenon is kept either very low in intensity, or the instant of time\r\nduring which the effect lasts is so small, that one cannot hope to observe\r\nthe result sought for. If a voltaic battery be used, these bodies are all\r\nelectrolytes, and the evolution of gas, or the production of other changes,\r\ninterferes and prevents observation of the effect required.\r\n\r\n1605. There are, nevertheless, some experiments which illustrate the\r\nconnection. Two platina wires, forming the electrodes of a powerful voltaic\r\nbattery, were placed side by side, near each other, in distilled water,\r\nhermetically sealed up in a strong glass tube, some minute vegetable fibres\r\nbeing present in the water. When, from the evolution of gas and the\r\nconsequent increased pressure, the bubbles formed on the electrodes were so\r\nsmall as to produce but feebly ascending currents, then it could be\r\nobserved that the filaments present were attracted and repelled between the\r\ntwo wires, as they would have been between two oppositely charged surfaces\r\nin air or oil of turpentine, moving so quickly as to displace and disturb\r\nthe bubbles and the currents which these tended to form. Now I think it\r\ncannot be doubted, that under similar circumstances, and with an abundant\r\nsupply of electricity, of sufficient tension also, convective currents\r\nmight have been formed; the attractions and repulsions of the filaments\r\nwere, in fact, the elements of such currents (1572.), and therefore water,\r\nthough almost infinitely above air or oil of turpentine as a conductor, is\r\na medium in which similar currents can take place.\r\n\r\n1606. I had an apparatus made (fig. 142.) in which _a_ is a plate of\r\nshell-lac, _b_ a fine platina wire passing through it, and having only the\r\nsection of the wire exposed above; _c_ a ring of bibulous paper resting on\r\nthe shell-lac, and _d_ distilled water retained by the paper in its place,\r\nand just sufficient in quantity to cover the end of the wire _b_; another\r\nwire, _e_, touched a piece of tinfoil lying in the water, and was also\r\nconnected with a discharging train; in this way it was easy, by rendering\r\n_b_ either positive or negative, to send a current of electricity by its\r\nextremity into the fluid, and so away by the wire _e_.\r\n\r\n1607. On connecting _b_ with the conductor of a powerful electrical\r\nmachine, not the least disturbance of the level of the fluid over the end\r\nof the wire during the working of the machine could be observed; but at the\r\nsame time there was not the smallest indication of electrical charge about\r\nthe conductor of the machine, so complete was the discharge. I conclude\r\nthat the quantity of electricity passed in a _given time_ had been too\r\nsmall, when compared with the conducting power of the fluid to produce the\r\ndesired effect.\r\n\r\n1608. I then charged a large Leyden battery (291.), and discharged it\r\nthrough the wire _b_, interposing, however, a wet thread, two feet long, to\r\nprevent a spark in the water, and to reduce what would else have been a\r\nsudden violent discharge into one of more moderate character, enduring for\r\na sensible length of time (334.). I now did obtain a very brief elevation\r\nof the water over the end of the wire; and though a few minute bubbles of\r\ngas were at the same time formed there, so as to prevent me from asserting\r\nthat the effect was unequivocally the same as that obtained by DAVY in the\r\nmetals, yet, according to my best judgement, it was partly, and I believe\r\nprincipally, of that nature.\r\n\r\n1609. I employed a voltaic battery of 100 pair of four-inch plates for\r\nexperiments of a similar nature with electrolytes. In these cases the\r\nshell-lac was cupped, and the wire _b_ 0.2 of an inch in diameter.\r\nSometimes I used a positive amalgamated zinc wire in contact with dilute\r\nsulphuric acid; at others, a negative copper wire in a solution of sulphate\r\nof copper; but, because of the evolution of gas, the precipitation of\r\ncopper, &c., I was not able to obtain decided results. It is but right to\r\nmention, that when I made use of mercury, endeavouring to repeat DAVY's\r\nexperiment, the battery of 100 pair was not sufficient to produce the\r\nelevations[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] In the experiments at the Royal Institution, Sir H. Davy used, I\r\n  think, 500 or 600 pairs of plates. Those at the London Institution\r\n  were made with the apparatus of Mr. Pepys (consisting of an enormous\r\n  single pair of plates), described in the Philosophical Transactions\r\n  for 1832, p. 187.\r\n\r\n1610. The latter experiments (1609.) may therefore be considered as failing\r\nto give the hoped-for proof, but I have much confidence in the former\r\n(1605. 1608.), and in the considerations (1603.) connected with them. If I\r\nhave rightly viewed them, and we may be allowed to compare the currents at\r\npoints and surfaces in such extremely different bodies as air and the\r\nmetals, and admit that they are effects of the _same_ kind, differing only\r\nin degree and in proportion to the insulating or conducting power of the\r\ndielectric used, what great additional argument we obtain in favour of that\r\ntheory, which in the phenomena of insulation and conduction also, as in\r\nthese, would link _the same_ apparently dissimilar substances together\r\n(1336. 1561.); and how completely the general view, which refers all the\r\nphenomena to the direct action of the molecules of matter, seems to embrace\r\nthe various isolated phenomena as they successively come under\r\nconsideration!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1611. The connection of this convective or carrying effect, which depends\r\nupon a certain degree of insulation, with conduction; i.e. the occurrence\r\nof both in so many of the substances referred to, as, for instance, the\r\nmetals, water, air, &c., would lead to many very curious theoretical\r\ngeneralizations, which I must not indulge in here. One point, however, I\r\nshall venture to refer to. Conduction appears to be essentially an action\r\nof contiguous particles, and the considerations just stated, together with\r\nothers formerly expressed (1326, 1336, &c.), lead to the conclusion, that\r\nall bodies conduct, and by the same process, air as well as metals; the\r\nonly difference being in the necessary degree of force or tension between\r\nthe particles which must exist before the act of conduction or transfer\r\nfrom one particle to another can take place.\r\n\r\n1612. The question then arises, what is this limiting condition which\r\nseparates, as it were, conduction and insulation from each other? Does it\r\nconsist in a difference between the two contiguous particles, or the\r\ncontiguous poles of these particles, in the nature and amount of positive\r\nand negative force, no communication or discharge occurring unless that\r\ndifference rises up to a certain degree, variable for different bodies, but\r\nalways the same for the same body? Or is it true that, however small the\r\ndifference between two such particles, if _time_ be allowed, equalization\r\nof force will take place, even with the particles of such bodies as air,\r\nsulphur or lac? In the first case, insulating power in any particular body\r\nwould be proportionate to the degree of the assumed necessary difference of\r\nforce; in the second, to the _time_ required to equalize equal degrees of\r\ndifference in different bodies. With regard to airs, one is almost led to\r\nexpect a permanent difference of force; but in all other bodies, time seems\r\nto be quite sufficient to ensure, ultimately, complete conduction. The\r\ndifference in the modes by which insulation may be sustained, or conduction\r\neffected, is not a mere fanciful point, but one of great importance, as\r\nbeing essentially connected with the molecular theory of induction, and the\r\nmanner in which the particles of bodies assume and retain their polarized\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n¶ xi. _Relation of a vacuum to electrical phenomena._\r\n\r\n1613. It would seem strange, if a theory which refers all the phenomena of\r\ninsulation and conduction, i.e. all electrical phenomena, to the action of\r\ncontiguous particles, were to omit to notice the assumed possible case of a\r\n_vacuum_. Admitting that a vacuum can be produced, it would be a very\r\ncurious matter indeed to know what its relation to electrical phenomena\r\nwould be; and as shell-lac and metal are directly opposed to each other,\r\nwhether a vacuum would be opposed to them both, and allow neither of\r\ninduction or conduction across it. Mr. Morgan[A] has said that a vacuum\r\ndoes not conduct. Sir H. Davy concluded from his investigations, that as\r\nperfect a vacuum as could be made[B] did conduct, but does not consider the\r\nprepared spaces which he used as absolute vacua. In such experiments I\r\nthink I have observed the luminous discharge to be principally on the inner\r\nsurface of the glass; and it does not appear at all unlikely, that, if the\r\nvacuum refused to conduct, still the surface of glass next it might carry\r\non that action.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1785, p. 272\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. 1822, p. 64.\r\n\r\n1614. At one time, when I thought inductive force was exerted in right\r\nlines, I hoped to illustrate this important question by making experiments\r\non induction with metallic mirrors (used only as conducting vessels)\r\nexposed towards a very clear sky at night time, and of such concavity that\r\nnothing but the firmament could be visible from the lowest part of the\r\nconcave _n_, fig. 143. Such mirrors, when electrified, as by connexion with\r\na Leyden jar, and examined by a carrier ball, readily gave electricity at\r\nthe lowest part of their concavity if in a room; but I was in hopes of\r\nfinding that, circumstanced as before stated, they would give little or\r\nnone at the same spot, if the atmosphere above really terminated in a\r\nvacuum. I was disappointed in the conclusion, for I obtained as much\r\nelectricity there as before; but on discovering the action of induction in\r\ncurved lines (1231.), found a full and satisfactory explanation of the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n1615. My theory, as far as I have ventured it, does not pretend to decide\r\nupon the consequences of a vacuum. It is not at present limited\r\nsufficiently, or rendered precise enough, either by experiments relating to\r\nspaces void of matter, or those of other kinds, to indicate what would\r\nhappen in the vacuum case. I have only as yet endeavoured to establish,\r\nwhat all the facts seem to prove, that when electrical phenomena, as those\r\nof induction, conduction, insulation and discharge occur, they depend on,\r\nand are produced by the action of _contiguous_ particles of matter, the\r\nnext existing particle being considered as the contiguous one; and I have\r\nfurther assumed, that these particles are polarized; that each exhibits the\r\ntwo forces, or the force in two directions (1295. 1298.); and that they act\r\nat a distance, only by acting on the _contiguous_ and intermediate\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\n1616. But assuming that a perfect vacuum were to intervene in the course of\r\nthe lines of inductive action (1304.), it does not follow from this theory,\r\nthat the particles on opposite sides of such a vacuum could not act on each\r\nother. Suppose it possible for a positively electrified particle to be in\r\nthe centre of a vacuum an inch in diameter, nothing in my present views\r\nforbids that the particle should act at the distance of half an inch on all\r\nthe particles forming the inner superficies of the bounding sphere, and\r\nwith a force consistent with the well-known law of the squares of the\r\ndistance. But suppose the sphere of an inch were full of insulating matter,\r\nthe electrified particle would not then, according to my notion, act\r\ndirectly on the distant particles, but on those in immediate association\r\nwith it, employing _all_ its power in polarizing them; producing in them\r\nnegative force equal in amount to its own positive force and directed\r\ntowards the latter, and positive force of equal amount directed outwards\r\nand acting in the same manner upon the layer of particles next in\r\nsuccession. So that ultimately, those particles in the surface of a sphere\r\nof half an inch radius, which were acted on _directly_ when that sphere was\r\na vacuum, will now be acted on _indirectly_ as respects the central\r\nparticle or source of action, i.e. they will be polarized in the same way,\r\nand with the same amount of force.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 19. _Nature of the electric current._\r\n\r\n\r\n1617. The word _current_ is so expressive in common language, that when\r\napplied in the consideration of electrical phenomena we can hardly divest\r\nit sufficiently of its meaning, or prevent our minds from being prejudiced\r\nby it (283. 511.). I shall use it in its common electrical sense, namely,\r\nto express generally a certain condition and relation of electrical forces\r\nsupposed to be in progression.\r\n\r\n1618. A current is produced both by excitement and discharge; and\r\nwhatsoever the variation of the two general causes may be, the effect\r\nremains the same. Thus excitement may occur in many ways, as by friction,\r\nchemical action, influence of heat, change of condition, induction, &c.;\r\nand discharge has the forms of conduction, electrolyzation, disruptive\r\ndischarge, and convection; yet the current connected with these actions,\r\nwhen it occurs, appears in all cases to be the same. This constancy in the\r\ncharacter of the current, notwithstanding the particular and great\r\nvariations which may be made in the mode of its occurrence, is exceedingly\r\nstriking and important; and its investigation and development promise to\r\nsupply the most open and advantageous road to a true and intimate\r\nunderstanding of the nature of electrical forces.\r\n\r\n1619. As yet the phenomena of the current have presented nothing in\r\nopposition to the view I have taken of the nature of induction as an action\r\nof contiguous particles. I have endeavoured to divest myself of prejudices\r\nand to look for contradictions, but I have not perceived any in conductive,\r\nelectrolytic, convective, or disruptive discharge.\r\n\r\n1620. Looking at the current as a _cause_, it exerts very extraordinary and\r\ndiverse powers, not only in its course and on the bodies in which it\r\nexists, but collaterally, as in inductive or magnetic phenomena.\r\n\r\n1621. _Electrolytic action._--One of its direct actions is the exertion of\r\npure chemical force, this being a result which has now been examined to a\r\nconsiderable extent. The effect is found to be _constant_ and _definite_\r\nfor the quantity of electric force discharged (783. &c.); and beyond that,\r\nthe _intensity_ required is in relation to the intensity of the affinity or\r\nforces to be overcome (904. 906. 911.). The current and its consequences\r\nare here proportionate; the one may be employed to represent the other; no\r\npart of the effect of either is lost or gained; so that the case is a\r\nstrict one, and yet it is the very case which most strikingly illustrates\r\nthe doctrine that induction is an action of contiguous particles (1164.\r\n1343.).\r\n\r\n1622. The process of electrolytic discharge appears to me to be in close\r\nanalogy, and perhaps in its nature identical with another process of\r\ndischarge, which at first seems very different from it, I mean _convection_\r\n(1347. 1572.). In the latter case the particles may travel for yards across\r\na chamber; they may produce strong winds in the air, so as to move\r\nmachinery; and in fluids, as oil of turpentine, may even shake the hand,\r\nand carry heavy metallic bodies about[A]; and yet I do not see that the\r\nforce, either in kind or action, is at all different to that by which a\r\nparticle of hydrogen leaves one particle of oxygen to go to another, or by\r\nwhich a particle of oxygen travels in the contrary direction.\r\n\r\n  [A] If a metallic vessel three or four inches deep, containing oil of\r\n  turpentine, be insulated and electrified, and a rod with a ball (an\r\n  inch or more in diameter) at the end have the ball immersed in the\r\n  fluid whilst the end is held in the hand, the mechanical force\r\n  generated when the ball is moved to and from the sides of the vessel\r\n  will soon be evident to the experimenter.\r\n\r\n1623. Travelling particles of the air can effect chemical changes just as\r\nwell as the contact of a fixed platina electrode, or that of a combining\r\nelectrode, or the ions of a decomposing electrolyte (453. 471.); and in the\r\nexperiment formerly described, where eight places of decomposition were\r\nrendered active by one current (469.), and where charged particles of air\r\nin motion were the only electrical means of connecting these parts of the\r\ncurrent, it seems to me that the action of the particles of the electrolyte\r\nand of the air were essentially the same. A particle of air was rendered\r\npositive; it travelled in a certain determinate direction, and coming to an\r\nelectrolyte, communicated its powers; an equal amount of positive force was\r\naccordingly acquired by another particle (the hydrogen), and the latter, so\r\ncharged, travelled as the former did, and in the same direction, until it\r\ncame to another particle, and transferred its power and motion, making that\r\nother particle active. Now, though the particle of air travelled over a\r\nvisible and occasionally a large space, whilst the particle of the\r\nelectrolyte moved over an exceedingly small one; though the air particle\r\nmight be oxygen, nitrogen, or hydrogen, receiving its charge from force of\r\nhigh intensity, whilst the electrolytic particle of hydrogen had a natural\r\naptness to receive the positive condition with extreme facility; though the\r\nair particle might be charged with very little electricity at a very high\r\nintensity by one process, whilst the hydrogen particle might be charged\r\nwith much electricity at a very low intensity by another process; these are\r\nnot differences of kind, as relates to the final discharging action of\r\nthese particles, but only of degree; not essential differences which make\r\nthings unlike, but such differences as give to things, similar in their\r\nnature, that great variety which fits them for their office in the system\r\nof the universe.\r\n\r\n1624. So when a particle of air, or of dust in it, electrified at a\r\nnegative point, moves on through the influence of the inductive forces\r\n(1572.) to the next positive surface, and after discharge passes away, it\r\nseems to me to represent exactly that particle of oxygen which, having been\r\nrendered negative in the electrolyte, is urged by the same disposition of\r\ninductive forces, and going to the positive platina electrode, is there\r\ndischarged, and then passes away, as the air or dust did before it.\r\n\r\n1625. _Heat_ is another direct effect of the _current_ upon substances in\r\nwhich it occurs, and it becomes a very important question, as to the\r\nrelation of the electric and heating forces, whether the latter is always\r\ndefinite in amount[A]. There are many cases, even amongst bodies which\r\nconduct without change, that at present are irreconcileable with the\r\nassumption that it is[B]; but there are also many which indicate that, when\r\nproper limitations are applied, the heat produced is definite. Harris has\r\nshown this for a given length of current in a metallic wire, using common\r\nelectricity[C]; and De la Rive has proved the same point for voltaic\r\nelectricity by his beautiful application of Breguet's thermometer[D].\r\n\r\n  [A] See De la Rive's Researches, Bib. Universelle, 1829, xl. p. 40.\r\n\r\n  [B] Amongst others, Davy, Philosophical Transactions, 1821, p. 438.\r\n  Pelletier's important results, Annales de Chimie, 1834, lvi. p. 371.\r\n  and Becquerel's non-heating current, Bib.

When the production of heat is observed in electrolytes under\r\ndecomposition, the results are still more complicated. But important steps\r\nhave been taken in the investigation of this branch of the subject by De la\r\nRive[A] and others; and it is more than probable that, when the right\r\nlimitations are applied, constant and definite results will here also be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n  [A] Bib.

It is a most important part of the character of the current, and\r\nessentially connected with its very nature, that it is always the same. The\r\ntwo forces are everywhere in it. There is never one current of force or one\r\nfluid only. Any one part of the current may, as respects the presence of\r\nthe two forces there, be considered as precisely the same with any other\r\npart; and the numerous experiments which imply their possible separation,\r\nas well as the theoretical expressions which, being used daily, assume it,\r\nare, I think, in contradiction with facts (511, &c.). It appears to me to\r\nbe as impossible to assume a current of positive or a current of negative\r\nforce alone, or of the two at once with any predominance of one over the\r\nother, as it is to give an absolute charge to matter (516. 1169. 1177.).\r\n\r\n1628. The establishment of this truth, if, as I think, it be a truth, or on\r\nthe other hand the disproof of it, is of the greatest consequence. If, as a\r\nfirst principle, we can establish, that the centres of the two forces, or\r\nelements of force, never can be separated to any sensible distance, or at\r\nall events not further than the space between two contiguous particles\r\n(1615.), or if we can establish the contrary conclusion, how much more\r\nclear is our view of what lies before us, and how much less embarrassed the\r\nground over which we have to pass in attaining to it, than if we remain\r\nhalting between two opinions! And if, with that feeling, we rigidly test\r\nevery experiment which bears upon the point, as far as our prejudices will\r\nlet us (1161.), instead of permitting them with a theoretical expression to\r\npass too easily away, are we not much more likely to attain the real truth,\r\nand from that proceed with safety to what is at present unknown?\r\n\r\n1629. I say these things, not, I hope, to advance a particular view, but to\r\ndraw the strict attention of those who are able to investigate and judge of\r\nthe matter, to what must be a turning point in the theory of electricity;\r\nto a separation of two roads, one only of which can be right: and I hope I\r\nmay be allowed to go a little further into the facts which have driven me\r\nto the view I have just given.\r\n\r\n1630. When a wire in the voltaic circuit is heated, the temperature\r\nfrequently rises first, or most at one end. If this effect were due to any\r\nrelation of positive or negative as respects the current, it would be\r\nexceedingly important. I therefore examined several such cases; but when,\r\nkeeping the contacts of the wire and its position to neighbouring things\r\nunchanged, I altered the direction of the current, I found that the effect\r\nremained unaltered, showing that it depended, not upon the direction of the\r\ncurrent, but on other circumstances. So there is here no evidence of a\r\ndifference between one part of the circuit and another.\r\n\r\n1631. The same point, i.e. uniformity in every part, may be illustrated by\r\nwhat may be considered as the inexhaustible nature of the current when\r\nproducing particular effects; for these effects depend upon transfer only,\r\nand do not consume the power. Thus a current which will heat one inch of\r\nplatina wire will heat a hundred inches (853. note). If a current be\r\nsustained in a constant state, it will decompose the fluid in one\r\nvoltameter only, or in twenty others if they be placed in the circuit, in\r\neach to an amount equal to that in the single one.\r\n\r\n1632. Again, in cases of disruptive discharge, as in the spark, there is\r\nfrequently a dark part (1422.) which, by Professor Johnson, has been called\r\nthe neutral point[A]; and this has given rise to the use of expressions\r\nimplying that there are two electricities existing separately, which,\r\npassing to that spot, there combine and neutralize each other[B]. But if\r\nsuch expressions are understood as correctly indicating that positive\r\nelectricity alone is moving between the positive ball and that spot, and\r\nnegative electricity only between the negative ball and that spot, then\r\nwhat strange conditions these parts must be in; conditions, which to my\r\nmind are every way unlike those which really occur! In such a case, one\r\npart of a current would consist of positive electricity only, and that\r\nmoving in one direction; another part would consist of negative electricity\r\nonly, and that moving in the other direction; and a third part would\r\nconsist of an accumulation of the two electricities, not moving in either\r\ndirection, but mixing up together! and being in a relation to each other\r\nutterly unlike any relation which could be supposed to exist in the two\r\nformer portions of the discharge. This does not seem to me to be natural.\r\nIn a current, whatever form the discharge may take, or whatever part of the\r\ncircuit or current is referred to, as much positive force as is there\r\nexerted in one direction, so much negative force is there exerted in the\r\nother. If it were not so we should have bodies electrified not merely\r\npositive and negative, but on occasions in a most extraordinary manner, one\r\nbeing charged with five, ten, or twenty times as much of both positive and\r\nnegative electricity in equal quantities as another. At present, however,\r\nthere is no known fact indicating such states.\r\n\r\n  [A] Silliman's Journal, 1834, xxv. p. 57.\r\n\r\n  [B] Thomson on Heat and Electricity, p. 171.\r\n\r\n1633. Even in cases of convection, or carrying discharge, the statement\r\nthat the current is everywhere the same must in effect be true (1627.); for\r\nhow, otherwise, could the results formerly described occur? When currents\r\nof air constituted the mode of discharge between the portions of paper\r\nmoistened with iodide of potassium or sulphate of soda (465. 469.),\r\ndecomposition occurred; and I have since ascertained that, whether a\r\ncurrent of positive air issued from a spot, or one of negative air passed\r\ntowards it, the effect of the evolution of iodine or of acid was the same,\r\nwhilst the reversed currents produced alkali. So also in the magnetic\r\nexperiments (307.) whether the discharge was effected by the introduction\r\nof a wire, or the occurrence of a spark, or the passage of convective\r\ncurrents either one way or the other (depending on the electrified state of\r\nthe particles), the result was the same, being in all cases dependent upon\r\nthe perfect current.\r\n\r\n1634. Hence, the section of a current compared with other sections of the\r\nsame current must be a constant quantity, if the actions exerted be of the\r\nsame kind; or if of different kinds, then the forms under which the effects\r\nare produced are equivalent to each other, and experimentally convertible\r\nat pleasure. It is in sections, therefore, we must look for identity of\r\nelectrical force, even to the sections of sparks and carrying actions, as\r\nwell as those of wires and electrolytes.\r\n\r\n1635. In illustration of the utility and importance of establishing that\r\nwhich may be the true principle, I will refer to a few cases. The doctrine\r\nof unipolarity, as formerly stated, and I think generally understood[A], is\r\nevidently inconsistent with my view of a current (1627.); and the later\r\nsingular phenomena of poles and flames described by Erman and others[B]\r\npartake of the same inconsistency of character. If a unipolar body could\r\nexist, i.e. one that could conduct the one electricity and not the other,\r\nwhat very new characters we should have a right to expect in the currents\r\nof single electricities passing through them, and how greatly ought they to\r\ndiffer, not only from the common current which is supposed to have both\r\nelectricities travelling in opposite directions in equal amount at the same\r\ntime, but also from each other! The facts, which are excellent, have,\r\nhowever, gradually been more correctly explained by Becquerel[C],\r\nAndrews[D], and others; and I understand that Professor Ohms[E] has\r\nperfected the work, in his close examination of all the phenomena; and\r\nafter showing that similar phenomena can take place with good conductors,\r\nproves that with soap, &c. many of the effects are the mere consequences of\r\nthe bodies evolved by electrolytic action.\r\n\r\n  [A] Erman, Annales de Chimie, 1807. lxi. p. 115.

Not\r\n  understanding German, it is with extreme regret I confess I have not\r\n  access, and cannot do justice, to the many most valuable papers in\r\n  experimental electricity published in that language. I take this\r\n  opportunity also of stating another circumstance which occasions me\r\n  great trouble, and, as I find by experience, may make, me seemingly\r\n  regardless of the labours of others:--it is a gradual loss of memory\r\n  for some years past; and now, often when I read a memoir, I remember\r\n  that I have seen it before, and would have rejoiced if at the right\r\n  time I could have recollected and referred to it in the progress of my\r\n  own papers.--M.F.\r\n\r\n1636. I conclude, therefore, that the _facts_ upon which the doctrine of\r\nunipolarity was founded are not adverse to that unity and indivisibility of\r\ncharacter which I have stated the current to possess, any more than the\r\nphenomena of the pile itself (which might well bear comparison with those\r\nof unipolar bodies,) are opposed to it. Probably the effects which have\r\nbeen called effects of unipolarity, and the peculiar differences of the\r\npositive and negative surface when discharging into air, gases, or other\r\ndielectrics (1480. 1525.) which have been already referred to, may have\r\nconsiderable relation to each other[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See also Hare in Silliman's Journal, 1833. xxiv. 246.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1637. M. de la Rive has recently described a peculiar and remarkable effect\r\nof heat on a current when passing between electrodes and a fluid[A]. It is,\r\nthat if platina electrodes dip into acidulated water, no change is produced\r\nin the passing current by making the positive electrode hotter or colder;\r\nwhereas making the negative electrode hotter increased the deflexion of a\r\ngalvanometer affected by the current, from 12° to 30° and even 45°, whilst\r\nmaking it colder diminished the current in the same high proportions.\r\n\r\n  [A] Bibliothèque Universelle, 1837, vii. 388.\r\n\r\n1638. That one electrode should have this striking relation to heat whilst\r\nthe other remained absolutely without, seem to me as incompatible with what\r\nI conceived to be the character of a current as unipolarity (1627. 1635.),\r\nand it was therefore with some anxiety that I repeated the experiment. The\r\nelectrodes which I used were platina; the electrolyte, water containing\r\nabout one sixth of sulphuric acid by weight: the voltaic battery consisted\r\nof two pairs of amalgamated zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, and the galvanometer in the circuit was one with two needles, and\r\ngave when the arrangement was complete a deflexion of 10° or 12°.\r\n\r\n1639. Under these circumstances heating either electrode increased the\r\ncurrent; heating both produced still more effect. When both were heated, if\r\neither were cooled, the effect on the current fell in proportion. The\r\nproportion of effect due to heating this or that electrode varied, but on\r\nthe whole heating the negative seemed to favour the passage of the current\r\nsomewhat more than heating the positive. Whether the application of heat\r\nwere by a flame applied underneath, or one directed by a blowpipe from\r\nabove, or by a hot iron or coal, the effect was the same.\r\n\r\n1640. Having thus removed the difficulty out of the way of my views\r\nregarding a current, I did not pursue this curious experiment further. It\r\nis probable, that the difference between my results and those of M. de la\r\nRive may depend upon the relative values of the currents used; for I\r\nemployed only a weak one resulting from two pairs of plates two inches long\r\nand half an inch wide, whilst M. de la Rive used four pairs of plates of\r\nsixteen square inches in surface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1641. Electric discharges in the atmosphere in the form of balls of fire\r\nhave occasionally been described. Such phenomena appear to me to be\r\nincompatible with all that we know of electricity and its modes of\r\ndischarge. As _time_ is an element in the effect (1418. 1436.) it is\r\npossible perhaps that an electric discharge might really pass as a ball\r\nfrom place to place; but as every thing shows that its velocity must be\r\nalmost infinite, and the time of its duration exceedingly small, it is\r\nimpossible that the eye should perceive it as anything else than a line of\r\nlight. That phenomena of balls of fire may appear in the atmosphere, I do\r\nnot mean to deny; but that they have anything to do with the discharge of\r\nordinary electricity, or are at all related to lightning or atmospheric\r\nelectricity, is much more than doubtful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1642. All these considerations, and many others, help to confirm the\r\nconclusion, drawn over and over again, that the current is an indivisible\r\nthing; an axis of power, in every part of which both electric forces are\r\npresent in equal amount[A] (517. 1627.). With conduction and\r\nelectrolyzation, and even discharge by spark, such a view will harmonize\r\nwithout hurting any of our preconceived notions; but as relates to\r\nconvection, a more startling result appears, which must therefore be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n  [A] I am glad to refer here to the results obtained by Mr. Christie\r\n  with magneto-electricity, Philosophical Transactions, 1833, p. 113\r\n  note. As regards the current in a wire, they confirm everything that I\r\n  am contending for.\r\n\r\n1643. If two balls A and B be electrified in opposite states and held\r\nwithin each other's influence, the moment they move towards each other, a\r\ncurrent, or those effects which are understood by the word current, will be\r\nproduced. Whether A move towards B, or B move in the opposite direction\r\ntowards A, a current, and in both cases having the same _direction_, will\r\nresult. If A and B move from each other, then a _current_ in the opposite\r\ndirection, or equivalent effects, will be produced.\r\n\r\n1644. Or, as charge exists only by induction (1178. 1299.), and a body when\r\nelectrified is necessarily in relation to other bodies in the opposite\r\nstate; so, if a ball be electrified positively in the middle of a room and\r\nbe then moved in any direction, effects will be produced, as _current_ in\r\nthe same direction (to use the conventional mode of expression) had\r\nexisted: or, if the ball be negatively electrified, and then moved, effects\r\nas if a current in a direction contrary to that of the motion had been\r\nformed, will be produced.\r\n\r\n1645. I am saying of a single particle or of two what I have before said,\r\nin effect, of many (1633.). If the former account of currents be true, then\r\nthat just stated must be a necessary result. And, though the statement may\r\nseem startling at first, it is to be considered that, according to my\r\ntheory of induction, the charged conductor or particle is related to the\r\ndistant conductor in the opposite state, or that which terminates the\r\nextent of the induction, by all the intermediate particles (1165, 1295.),\r\nthese becoming polarized exactly as the particles of a solid electrolyte do\r\nwhen interposed between the two electrodes. Hence the conclusion regarding\r\nthe unity and identity of the current in the case of convection, jointly\r\nwith the former cases, is not so strange as it might at first appear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1646. There is a very remarkable phenomenon or effect of the electrolytic\r\ndischarge, first pointed out, I believe, by Mr. Porrett, of the\r\naccumulation of fluid under decomposing action in the current on one side\r\nof an interposed diaphragm[A]. It is a mechanical result; and as the liquid\r\npasses from the positive towards the negative electrode in all the known\r\ncases, it seems to establish a relation to the polar condition of the\r\ndielectric in which the current exists (1164. 1525.). It has not as yet\r\nbeen sufficiently investigated by experiment; for De la Rive says[B], it\r\nrequires that the water should be a bad conductor, as, for instance,\r\ndistilled water, the effect not happening with strong solutions; whereas,\r\nDutrochet says[C] the contrary is the case, and that, the effect is not\r\ndirectly due to the electric current.\r\n\r\n  [A] Annals of Philosophy, 1816. viii. p. 75.\r\n\r\n  [B] Annales de Chimie, 1835. xxviii. p. 196.\r\n\r\n  [C] Annales de Chimie, 1832, xlix. p. 423.\r\n\r\n1647. Becquerel, in his Traité de l'Electricité, has brought together the\r\nconsiderations which arise for and against the opinion, that the effect\r\ngenerally is an electric effect[A]. Though I have no decisive fact to quote\r\nat present, I cannot refrain from venturing an opinion, that the effect is\r\nanalogous both to combination and convection (1623.), being a case of\r\ncarrying due to the relation of the diaphragm and the fluid in contact with\r\nit, through which the electric discharge is jointly effected; and further,\r\nthat the peculiar relation of positive and negative small and large\r\nsurfaces already referred to (1482. 1503. 1525.), may be the direct cause\r\nof the fluid and the diaphragm travelling in contrary but determinate\r\ndirections. A very valuable experiment has been made by M. Becquerel with\r\nparticles of clay[B], which will probably bear importantly on this point.\r\n\r\n  [A] Vol. iv. p. 192, 197.\r\n\r\n  [B] Traité de l'Electricité, i. p. 285.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1648. _As long as_ the terms _current_ and _electro-dynamic_ are used to\r\nexpress those relations of the electric forces in which progression of\r\neither fluids or effects are supposed to occur (283.), _so long_ will the\r\nidea of velocity be associated with them; and this will, perhaps, be more\r\nespecially the case if the hypothesis of a fluid or fluids be adopted.\r\n\r\n1649. Hence has arisen the desire of estimating this velocity either\r\ndirectly or by some effect dependent on it; and amongst the endeavours to\r\ndo this correctly, may be mentioned especially those of Dr. Watson[A] in\r\n1748, and of Professor Wheatstone[B] in 1834; the electricity in the early\r\ntrials being supposed to travel from end to end of the arrangement, but in\r\nthe later investigations a distinction occasionally appearing to be made\r\nbetween the transmission of the effect and of the supposed fluid by the\r\nmotion of whose particles that effect is produced.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1748.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. 1834, p. 583.\r\n\r\n1650. Electrolytic action has a remarkable bearing upon this question of\r\nthe velocity of the current, especially as connected with the theory of an\r\nelectric fluid or fluids. In it there is an evident transfer of power with\r\nthe transfer of each particle of the anion or cathion present, to the next\r\nparticles of the cathion or anion; and as the amount of power is definite,\r\nwe have in this way a means of localizing as it were the force, identifying\r\nit by the particle and dealing it out in successive portions, which leads,\r\nI think, to very striking results.\r\n\r\n1651. Suppose, for instance, that water is undergoing decomposition by the\r\npowers of a voltaic battery. Each particle of hydrogen as it moves one way,\r\nor of oxygen as it moves in the other direction, will transfer a certain\r\namount of electrical force associated with it in the form of chemical\r\naffinity (822. 852. 918.) onwards through a distance, which is equal to\r\nthat through which the particle itself has moved. This transfer will be\r\naccompanied by a corresponding movement in the electrical forces throughout\r\nevery part of the circuit formed (1627. 1634.), and its effects may be\r\nestimated, as, for instance, by the heating of a wire (853.) at any\r\nparticular section of the current however distant. If the water be a cube\r\nof an inch in the side, the electrodes touching, each by a surface of one\r\nsquare inch, and being an inch apart, then, by the time that a tenth of it,\r\nor 25.25 grs., is decomposed, the particles of oxygen and hydrogen\r\nthroughout the mass may be considered as having moved relatively to each\r\nother in opposite directions, to the amount of the tenth of an inch; i.e.\r\nthat two particles at first in combination will after the motion be the\r\ntenth of an inch apart. Other motions which occur in the fluid will not at\r\nall interfere with this result; for they have no power of accelerating or\r\nretarding the electric discharge, and possess in fact no relation to it.\r\n\r\n1652. The quantity of electricity in 25.25 grains of water is, according to\r\nan estimate of the force which I formerly made (861.), equal to above 24\r\nmillions of charges of a large Leyden battery; or it would have kept any\r\nlength of a platina wire 1/104 of an inch in diameter red-hot for an hour\r\nand a half (853.). This result, though given only as an approximation, I\r\nhave seen no reason as yet to alter, and it is confirmed generally by the\r\nexperiments and results of M. Pouillet[A]. According to Mr. Wheatstone's\r\nexperiments, the influence or effects of the current would appear at a\r\ndistance of 576,000 miles in a second[B]. We have, therefore, in this view\r\nof the matter, on the one hand, an enormous quantity of power equal to a\r\nmost destructive thunder-storm appearing instantly at the distance of\r\n576,000 miles from its source, and on the other, a quiet effect, in\r\nproducing which the power had taken an hour and a half to travel through\r\nthe tenth of an inch: yet these are the equivalents to each other, being\r\neffects observed at the sections of one and the same current (1634.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Becquerel, Traité de l'Electricité, v. p. 278.\r\n\r\n  [B] Philosophical Transactions, 1834, p. 589.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1653. It is time that I should call attention to the lateral or transverse\r\nforces of the _current_. The great things which have been achieved by\r\nOersted, Arago, Ampère, Davy, De la Rive, and others, and the high degree\r\nof simplification which has been introduced into their arrangement by the\r\ntheory of Ampère, have not only done their full service in advancing most\r\nrapidly this branch of knowledge, but have secured to it such attention\r\nthat there is no necessity for urging on its pursuit. I refer of course to\r\nmagnetic action and its relations; but though this is the only recognised\r\nlateral action of the current, there is great reason for believing that\r\nothers exist and would by their discovery reward a close search for them\r\n(951.).\r\n\r\n1654. The magnetic or transverse action of the current seems to be in a\r\nmost extraordinary degree independent of those variations or modes of\r\naction which it presents directly in its course; it consequently is of the\r\nmore value to us, as it gives us a higher relation of the power than any\r\nthat might have varied with each mode of discharge. This discharge, whether\r\nit be by conduction through a wire with infinite velocity (1652.), or by\r\nelectrolyzation with its corresponding and exceeding slow motion (1651.),\r\nor by spark, and probably even by convection, produces a transverse\r\nmagnetic action always the same in kind and direction.\r\n\r\n1655. It has been shown by several experimenters, that whilst the discharge\r\nis of the _same kind_ the amount of lateral or magnetic force is very\r\nconstant (216. 366. 367. 368. 376.). But when we wish to compare discharge\r\nof different kinds, for the important purpose of ascertaining whether the\r\nsame amount of current will in its _different forms_ produce the same\r\namount of transverse action, we find the data very imperfect. Davy noticed,\r\nthat when the electric current was passing through an aqueous solution it\r\naffected a magnetic needle[A], and Dr. Ritchie says, that the current in\r\nthe electrolyte is as magnetic as that in a metallic wire[B], and has\r\ncaused water to revolve round a magnet as a wire carrying the current would\r\nrevolve.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1821, p. 426.\r\n\r\n  [B] Ibid. 1832, p. 294.\r\n\r\n1656. Disruptive discharge produces its magnetic effects: a strong spark,\r\npassed transversely to a steel needle, will magnetise it as well as if the\r\nelectricity of the spark were conducted by a metallic wire occupying the\r\nline of discharge; and Sir H. Davy has shown that the discharge of a\r\nvoltaic battery in vacuo is affected and has motion given to it by\r\napproximated magnets[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1821, p. 427.\r\n\r\n1657. Thus the three very different modes of discharge, namely, conduction,\r\nelectrolyzation, and disruptive discharge, agree in producing the important\r\ntransverse phenomenon of magnetism. Whether convection or carrying\r\ndischarge will produce the same phenomenon has not been determined, and the\r\nfew experiments I have as yet had time to make do not enable me to answer\r\nin the affirmative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1658. Having arrived at this point in the consideration of the current and\r\nin the endeavour to apply its phenomena as tests of the truth or fallacy of\r\nthe theory of induction which I have ventured to set forth, I am now very\r\nmuch tempted to indulge in a few speculations respecting its lateral action\r\nand its possible connexion with the transverse condition of the lines of\r\nordinary induction (1165, 1304.)[A]. I have long sought and still seek for\r\nan effect or condition which shall be to statical electricity what magnetic\r\nforce is to current electricity (1411.); for as the lines of discharge are\r\nassociated with a certain transverse effect, so it appeared to me\r\nimpossible but that the lines of tension or of inductive action, which of\r\nnecessity precede that discharge, should also have their correspondent\r\ntransverse condition or effect (951.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Refer for further investigations to 1709.--1736.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1659. According to the beautiful theory of Ampère, the transverse force of\r\na current may be represented by its attraction for a similar current and\r\nits repulsion of a contrary current. May not then the equivalent transverse\r\nforce of static electricity be represented by that lateral tension or\r\nrepulsion which the lines of inductive action appear to possess (1304.)?\r\nThen again, when current or discharge occurs between two bodies, previously\r\nunder inductrical relations to each other, the lines of inductive force\r\nwill weaken and fade away, and, as their lateral repulsive tension\r\ndiminishes, will contract and ultimately disappear in the line of\r\ndischarge. May not this be an effect identical with the attractions of\r\nsimilar currents? i.e. may not the passage of static electricity into\r\ncurrent electricity, and that of the lateral tension of the lines of\r\ninductive force into the lateral attraction of lines of similar discharge,\r\nhave the same relation and dependences, and run parallel to each other?\r\n\r\n1660. The phenomena of induction amongst currents which I had the good\r\nfortune to discover some years ago (6. &c. 1048.) may perchance here form a\r\nconnecting link in the series of effects. When a current is first formed,\r\nit tends to produce a current in the contrary direction in all the matter\r\naround it; and if that matter have conducting properties and be fitly\r\ncircumstanced, such a current is produced. On the contrary, when the\r\noriginal current is stopped, one in the same direction tends to form all\r\naround it, and, in conducting matter properly arranged, will be excited.\r\n\r\n1661. Now though we perceive the effects only in that portion of matter\r\nwhich, being in the neighbourhood, has conducting properties, yet\r\nhypothetically it is probable, that the nonconducting matter has also its\r\nrelations to, and is affected by, the disturbing cause, though we have not\r\nyet discovered them. Again and again the relation of conductors and\r\nnon-conductors has been shown to be one not of opposition in kind, but only\r\nof degree (1334, 1603.); and, therefore, for this, as well as for other\r\nreasons, it is probable, that what will affect a conductor will affect an\r\ninsulator also; producing perhaps what may deserve the term of the\r\nelectrotonic state (60. 242. 1114.).\r\n\r\n1662. It is the feeling of the necessity of some lateral connexion between\r\nthe lines of electric force (1114.); of some link in the chain of effects\r\nas yet unrecognised, that urges me to the expression of these speculations.\r\nThe same feeling has led me to make many experiments on the introduction of\r\ninsulating dielectrics having different inductive capacities (1270. 1277.)\r\nbetween magnetic poles and wires carrying currents, so as to pass across\r\nthe lines of magnetic force. I have employed such bodies both at rest and\r\nin motion, without, as yet, being able to detect any influence produced by\r\nthem; but I do by no means consider the experiments as sufficiently\r\ndelicate, and intend, very shortly, to render them more decisive[A].\r\n\r\n  [A] See onwards 1711.--1726.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1663. I think the hypothetical question may at present be put thus: can\r\nsuch considerations as those already generally expressed (1658.) account\r\nfor the transverse effects of electrical currents? are two such currents in\r\nrelation to each other merely by the inductive condition of the particles\r\nof matter between them, or are they in relation by some higher quality and\r\ncondition (1654.), which, acting at a distance and not by the intermediate\r\nparticles, has, like the force of gravity, no relation to them?\r\n\r\n1664. If the latter be the case, then, when electricity is acting upon and\r\nin matter, its direct and its transverse action are essentially different\r\nin their nature; for the former, if I am correct, will depend upon the\r\ncontiguous particles, and the latter will not. As I have said before, this\r\nmay be so, and I incline to that view at present; but I am desirous of\r\nsuggesting considerations why it may not, that the question may be\r\nthoroughly sifted.\r\n\r\n1665. The transverse power has a character of polarity impressed upon it.\r\nIn the simplest forms it appears as attraction or repulsion, according as\r\nthe currents are in the same or different directions: in the current and\r\nthe magnet it takes up the condition of tangential forces; and in magnets\r\nand their particles produces poles. Since the experiments have been made\r\nwhich have persuaded me that the polar forces of electricity, as in\r\ninduction and electrolytic action (1298. 1343.), show effects at a distance\r\nonly by means of the polarized contiguous and intervening particles, I have\r\nbeen led to expect that _all polar forces_ act in the same general manner;\r\nand the other kinds of phenomena which one can bring to bear upon the\r\nsubject seem fitted to strengthen that expectation. Thus in\r\ncrystallizations the effect is transmitted from particle to particle; and\r\nin this manner, in acetic acid or freezing water a crystal a few inches or\r\neven a couple of feet in length will form in less than a second, but\r\nprogressively and by a transmission of power from particle to particle.\r\nAnd, as far as I remember, no case of polar action, or partaking of polar\r\naction, except the one under discussion, can be found which does not act by\r\ncontiguous particles[A]. It is apparently of the nature of polar forces\r\nthat such should be the case, for the one force either finds or developed\r\nthe contrary force near to it, and has, therefore, no occasion to seek for\r\nit at a distance.\r\n\r\n  [A] I mean by contiguous particles those which are next to each other,\r\n  not that there is _no_ space between them. See (1616.).\r\n\r\n1666. But leaving these hypothetical notions respecting the nature of the\r\nlateral action out of sight, and returning to the direct effects, I think\r\nthat the phenomena examined and reasoning employed in this and the two\r\npreceding papers tend to confirm the view first taken (1464.), namely, that\r\nordinary inductive action and the effects dependent upon it are due to an\r\naction of the contiguous particles of the dielectric interposed between the\r\ncharged surfaces or parts which constitute, as it were, the terminations of\r\nthe effect. The great point of distinction and power (if it have any) in\r\nthe theory is, the making the dielectric of essential and specific\r\nimportance, instead of leaving it as it were a mere accidental circumstance\r\nor the simple representative of space, having no more influence over the\r\nphenomena than the space occupied by it. I have still certain other results\r\nand views respecting the nature of the electrical forces and excitation,\r\nwhich are connected with the present theory; and, unless upon further\r\nconsideration they sink in my estimation, I shall very shortly put them\r\ninto form as another series of these electrical researches.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution.\r\nFebruary 14th, 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTEENTH SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 20. _Nature of the electric force or forces._ § 21. _Relation of the\r\nelectric and magnetic forces._ § 22. _Note on electrical excitation._\r\n\r\nReceived June 21, 1838.--Read June 21, 1838.\r\n\r\n§ 20. _Nature of the electric force or forces._\r\n\r\n\r\n1667. The theory of induction set forth and illustrated in the three\r\npreceding series of experimental researches does not assume anything new as\r\nto the nature of the electric force or forces, but only as to their\r\ndistribution. The effects may depend upon the association of one electric\r\nfluid with the particles of matter, as in the theory of Franklin, Epinus,\r\nCavendish, and Mossotti; or they may depend upon the association of two\r\nelectric fluids, as in the theory of Dufay and Poisson; or they may not\r\ndepend upon anything which can properly be called the electric fluid, but\r\non vibrations or other affections of the matter in which they appear. The\r\ntheory is unaffected by such differences in the mode of viewing the nature\r\nof the forces; and though it professes to perform the important office of\r\nstating _how_ the powers are arranged (at least in inductive phenomena), it\r\ndoes not, as far as I can yet perceive, supply a single experiment which\r\ncan be considered as a distinguishing test of the truth of any one of these\r\nvarious views,\r\n\r\n1668. But, to ascertain how the forces are arranged, to trace them in their\r\nvarious relations to the particles of matter, to determine their general\r\nlaws, and also the specific differences which occur under these laws, is as\r\nimportant as, if not more so than, to know whether the forces reside in a\r\nfluid or not; and with the hope of assisting in this research, I shall\r\noffer some further developments, theoretical and experimental, of the\r\nconditions under which I suppose the particles of matter are placed when\r\nexhibiting inductive phenomena.\r\n\r\n1669. The theory assumes that all the _particles_, whether of insulating or\r\nconducting matter, are as wholes conductors.\r\n\r\n1670. That not being polar in their normal state, they can become so by the\r\ninfluence of neighbouring charged particles, the polar state being\r\ndeveloped at the instant, exactly as in an insulated conducting _mass_\r\nconsisting of many particles.\r\n\r\n1671. That the particles when polarized are in a forced state, and tend to\r\nreturn to their normal or natural condition.\r\n\r\n1672. That being as wholes conductors, they can readily be charged, either\r\n_bodily_ or _polarly_.\r\n\r\n1673. That particles which being contiguous[A] are also in the line of\r\ninductive action can communicate or transfer their polar forces one to\r\nanother _more_ or _less_ readily.\r\n\r\n  [A] See note to 1164.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1674. That those doing so less readily require the polar forces to be\r\nraised to a higher degree before this transference or communication takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n1675. That the _ready_ communication of forces between contiguous particles\r\nconstitutes _conduction_, and the _difficult_ communication _insulation_;\r\nconductors and insulators being bodies whose particles naturally possess\r\nthe property of communicating their respective forces easily or with\r\ndifficulty; having these differences just as they have differences of any\r\nother natural property.\r\n\r\n1676. That ordinary induction is the effect resulting from the action of\r\nmatter charged with excited or free electricity upon insulating matter,\r\ntending to produce in it an equal amount of the contrary state.\r\n\r\n1677. That it can do this only by polarizing the particles contiguous to\r\nit, which perform the same office to the next, and these again to those\r\nbeyond; and that thus the action is propagated from the excited body to the\r\nnext conducting mass, and there renders the contrary force evident in\r\nconsequence of the effect of communication which supervenes in the\r\nconducting mass upon the polarization of the particles of that body\r\n(1675.).\r\n\r\n1678. That therefore induction can only take place through or across\r\ninsulators; that induction is insulation, it being the necessary\r\nconsequence of the state of the particles and the mode in which the\r\ninfluence of electrical forces is transferred or transmitted through or\r\nacross such insulating media.\r\n\r\n1679. The particles of an insulating dielectric whilst under induction may\r\nbe compared to a series of small magnetic needles, or more correctly still\r\nto a series of small insulated conductors. If the space round a charged\r\nglobe were filled with a mixture of an insulating dielectric, as oil of\r\nturpentine or air, and small globular conductors, as shot, the latter being\r\nat a little distance from each other so as to be insulated, then these\r\nwould in their condition and action exactly resemble what I consider to be\r\nthe condition and action of the particles of the insulating dielectric\r\nitself (1337.). If the globe were charged, these little conductors would\r\nall be polar; if the globe were discharged, they would all return to their\r\nnormal state, to be polarized again upon the recharging of the globe. The\r\nstate developed by induction through such particles on a mass of conducting\r\nmutter at a distance would be of the contrary kind, and exactly equal in\r\namount to the force in the inductric globe. There would be a lateral\r\ndiffusion of force (1224. 1297.), because each polarized sphere would be in\r\nan active or tense relation to all those contiguous to it, just as one\r\nmagnet can affect two or more magnetic needles near it, and these again a\r\nstill greater number beyond them. Hence would result the production of\r\ncurved lines of inductive force if the inducteous body in such a mixed\r\ndielectric were an uninsulated metallic ball (1219. &c.) or other properly\r\nshaped mass. Such curved lines are the consequences of the two electric\r\nforces arranged as I have assumed them to be: and, that the inductive force\r\ncan be directed in such curved lines is the strongest proof of the presence\r\nof the two powers and the polar condition of the dielectric particles.\r\n\r\n1680. I think it is evident, that in the case stated, action at a distance\r\ncan only result through an action of the contiguous conducting particles.\r\nThere is no reason why the inductive body should polarize or affect\r\n_distant_ conductors and leave those _near_ it, namely the particles of the\r\ndielectric, unaffected: and everything in the form of fact and experiment\r\nwith conducting masses or particles of a sensible size contradicts such a\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\n1681. A striking character of the electric power is that it is limited and\r\nexclusive, and that the two forces being always present are exactly equal\r\nin amount. The forces are related in one of two ways, either as in the\r\nnatural normal condition of an uncharged insulated conductor; or as in the\r\ncharged state, the latter being a case of induction.\r\n\r\n1682. Cases of induction are easily arranged so that the two forces being\r\nlimited in their direction shall present no phenomena or indications\r\nexternal to the apparatus employed, Thus, if a Leyden jar, having its\r\nexternal coating a little higher than the internal, be charged and then its\r\ncharging ball and rod removed, such jar will present no electrical\r\nappearances so long as its outside is uninsulated. The two forces which may\r\nbe said to be in the coatings, or in the particles of the dielectric\r\ncontiguous to them, are entirely engaged to each other by induction through\r\nthe glass; and a carrier ball (1181.) applied either to the inside or\r\noutside of the jar will show no signs of electricity. But if the jar be\r\ninsulated, and the charging ball and rod, in an uncharged state and\r\nsuspended by an insulating thread of white silk, be restored to their\r\nplace, then the part projecting above the jar will give electrical\r\nindications and charge the carrier, and at the same time the _outside_\r\ncoating of the jar will be found in the opposite state and inductric\r\ntowards external surrounding objects.\r\n\r\n1683. These are simple consequences of the theory. Whilst the charge of the\r\ninner coating could induce only through the glass towards the outer\r\ncoating, and the latter contained no more of the contrary force than was\r\nequivalent to it, no induction external to the jar could be perceived; but\r\nwhen the inner coating was extended by the rod and ball so that it could\r\ninduce through the air towards external objects, then the tension of the\r\npolarized glass molecules would, by their tendency to return to the normal\r\nstate, fall a little, and a portion of the charge passing to the surface of\r\nthis new part of the inner conductor, would produce inductive action\r\nthrough the air towards distant objects, whilst at the same time a part of\r\nthe force in the outer coating previously directed inwards would now be at\r\nliberty, and indeed be constrained to induct outwards through the air,\r\nproducing in that outer coating what is sometimes called, though I think\r\nvery improperly, free charge. If a small Leyden jar be converted into that\r\nform of apparatus usually known by the name of the electric well, it will\r\nillustrate this action very completely.\r\n\r\n1684. The terms _free charge_ and _dissimulated electricity_ convey\r\ntherefore erroneous notions if they are meant to imply any difference as to\r\nthe mode or kind of action. The charge upon an insulated conductor in the\r\nmiddle of a room is in the same relation to the walls of that room as the\r\ncharge upon the inner coating of a Leyden jar is to the outer coating of\r\nthe same jar. The one is not more _free_ or more _dissimulated_ than the\r\nother; and when sometimes we make electricity appear where it was not\r\nevident before, as upon the outside of a charged jar, when, after\r\ninsulating it, we touch the inner coating, it is only because we divert\r\nmore or less of the inductive force from one direction into another; for\r\nnot the slightest change is in such circumstances impressed upon the\r\ncharacter or action of the force.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1685. Having given this general theoretical view, I will now notice\r\nparticular points relating to the nature of the assumed electric polarity\r\nof the insulating dielectric particles.\r\n\r\n1686. The polar state may be considered in common induction as a forced\r\nstate, the particles tending to return to their normal condition. It may\r\nprobably be raised to a very high degree by approximation of the inductric\r\nand inducteous bodies or by other circumstances; and the phenomena of\r\nelectrolyzation (861. 1652. 1796.) seem to imply that the quantity of power\r\nwhich can thus be accumulated on a single particle is enormous. Hereafter\r\nwe may be able to compare corpuscular forces, as those of gravity,\r\ncohesion, electricity, and chemical affinity, and in some way or other from\r\ntheir effects deduce their relative equivalents; at present we are not able\r\nto do so, but there seems no reason to doubt that their electrical, which\r\nare at the same time their chemical forces (891. 918.), will be by far the\r\nmost energetic.\r\n\r\n1687. I do not consider the powers when developed by the polarization as\r\nlimited to two distinct points or spots on the surface of each particle to\r\nbe considered as the poles of an axis, but as resident on large portions of\r\nthat surface, as they are upon the surface of a conductor of sensible size\r\nwhen it is thrown into a polar state. But it is very probable,\r\nnotwithstanding, that the particles of different bodies may present\r\nspecific differences in this respect, the powers not being equally diffused\r\nthough equal in quantity; other circumstances also, as form and quality,\r\ngiving to each a peculiar polar relation. It is perhaps to the existence of\r\nsome such differences as these that we may attribute the specific actions\r\nof the different dielectrics in relation to discharge(1394. 1508.). Thus\r\nwith respect to oxygen and nitrogen singular contrasts were presented when\r\nspark and brush discharge were made to take place in these gases, as may be\r\nseen by reference to the Table in paragraph 1518 of the Thirteenth Series;\r\nfor with nitrogen, when the small, negative or the large positive ball was\r\nrendered inductric, the effects corresponded with those which in oxygen\r\nwere produced when the small positive or the large negative ball was\r\nrendered inductric.\r\n\r\n1688. In such solid bodies as glass, lac, sulphur, &c., the particles\r\nappear to be able to become polarized in all directions, for a mass when\r\nexperimented upon so as to ascertain its inductive capacity in three or\r\nmore directions (1690.), gives no indication of a difference. Now as the\r\nparticles are fixed in the mass, and as the direction of the induction\r\nthrough them must change with its change relative to the mass, the constant\r\neffect indicates that they can be polarized electrically in any direction.\r\nThis accords with the view already taken of each particle as a whole being\r\na conductor (1669.), and, as an experimental fact, helps to confirm that\r\nview.\r\n\r\n1689. But though particles may thus be polarized in _any_ direction under\r\nthe influence of powers which are probably of extreme energy (1686.), it\r\ndoes not follow that each particle may not tend to polarize to a greater\r\ndegree, or with more facility, in one direction than another; or that\r\ndifferent kinds may not have specific differences in this respect, as they\r\nhave differences of conducting and other powers (1296. 1326. 1395.). I\r\nsought with great anxiety for a relation of this nature; and selecting\r\ncrystalline bodies as those in which all the particles are symmetrically\r\nplaced, and therefore best fitted to indicate any result which might depend\r\nupon variation of the direction of the forces to the direction of the\r\nparticles in which they were developed, experimented very carefully with\r\nthem. I was the more strongly stimulated to this inquiry by the beautiful\r\nelectrical condition of the crystalline bodies tourmaline and boracite, and\r\nhoped also to discover a relation between electric polarity and that of\r\ncrystallization, or even of cohesion itself (1316.). My experiments have\r\nnot established any connexion of the kind sought for. But as I think it of\r\nequal importance to show either that there is or is not such a relation, I\r\nshall briefly describe the results.\r\n\r\n1690. The form of experiment was as follows. A brass ball 0.73 of an inch\r\nin diameter, fixed at the end of a horizontal brass rod, and that at the\r\nend of a brass cylinder, was by means of the latter connected with a large\r\nLeyden battery (291.) by perfect metallic communications, the object being\r\nto keep that ball, by its connexion with the charged battery in an\r\nelectrified state, very nearly uniform, for half an hour at a time. This\r\nwas the inductric ball. The inducteous ball was the carrier of the torsion\r\nelectrometer (1229. 1314.); and the dielectric between them was a cube cut\r\nfrom a crystal, so that two of its faces should be perpendicular to the\r\noptical axis, whilst the other four were parallel to it. A small projecting\r\npiece of shell-lac was fixed on the inductric ball at that part opposite to\r\nthe attachment of the brass rod, for the purpose of preventing actual\r\ncontact between the ball and the crystal cube. A coat of shell-lac was also\r\nattached to that side of the carrier ball which was to be towards the cube,\r\nbeing also that side which was furthest from the repelled ball in the\r\nelectrometer when placed in its position in that instrument. The cube was\r\ncovered with a thin coat of shell-lac dissolved in alcohol, to prevent the\r\ndeposition of damp upon its surface from the air. It was supported upon a\r\nsmall table of shell-lac fixed on the top of a stem of the same substance,\r\nthe latter being of sufficient strength to sustain the cube, and yet\r\nflexible enough from its length to act as a spring, and allow the cube to\r\nbear, when in its place, against the shell-lac on the inductric ball.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n1691. Thus it was easy to bring the inducteous ball always to the same\r\ndistance from the inductric bull, and to uninsulate and insulate it again\r\nin its place; and then, after measuring the force in the electrometer\r\n(1181.), to return it to its place opposite to the inductric ball for a\r\nsecond observation. Or it was easy by revolving the stand which supported\r\nthe cube to bring four of its faces in succession towards the inductric\r\nball, and so observe the force when the lines of inductive action (1304.)\r\ncoincided with, or were transverse to, the direction of the optical axis of\r\nthe crystal. Generally from twenty to twenty-eight observations were made\r\nin succession upon the four vertical faces of a cube, and then an average\r\nexpression of the inductive force was obtained, and compared with similar\r\naverages obtained at other times, every precaution being taken to secure\r\naccurate results.\r\n\r\n1692. The first cube used was of _rock crystal_; it was 0.7 of an inch in\r\nthe side. It presented a remarkable and constant difference, the average of\r\nnot less than 197 observations, giving 100 for the specific inductive\r\ncapacity in the direction coinciding with the optical axis of the cube,\r\nwhilst 93.59 and 93.31 were the expressions for the two transverse\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n1693. But with a second cube of rock crystal corresponding results were not\r\nobtained. It was 0.77 of an inch in the side. The average of many\r\nexperiments gave 100 for the specific inductive capacity coinciding with\r\nthe direction of the optical axis, and 98.6 and 99.92 for the two other\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n1694. Lord Ashley, whom I have found ever ready to advance the cause of\r\nscience, obtained for me the loan of three globes of rock crystal belonging\r\nto Her Grace the Duchess of Sutherland for the purposes of this\r\ninvestigation. Two had such fissures as to render them unfit for the\r\nexperiments (1193. 1698.). The third, which was very superior, gave me no\r\nindications of any difference in the inductive force for different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n1695. I then used cubes of Iceland spar. One 0.5 of an inch in diameter\r\ngave 100 for the axial direction, and 98.66 and 95.74 for the two cross\r\ndirections. The other, 0.8 of an inch in the side, gave 100 for the axial\r\ndirection, whilst 101.73 and 101.86 were the numbers for the cross\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n1696. Besides these differences there were others, which I do not think it\r\nneedful to state, since the main point is not confirmed. For though the\r\nexperiments with the first cube raised great expectation, they have not\r\nbeen generalized by those which followed. I have no doubt of the results as\r\nto that cube, but they cannot as yet be referred to crystallization. There\r\nare in the cube some faintly coloured layers parallel to the optical axis,\r\nand the matter which colours them may have an influence; but then the\r\nlayers are also nearly parallel to a cross direction, and if at all\r\ninfluential should show some effect in that direction also, which they did\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n1697. In some of the experiments one half or one part of a cube showed a\r\nsuperiority to another part, and this I could not trace to any charge the\r\ndifferent parts had received. It was found that the varnishing of the cubes\r\nprevented any communication of charge to them, except (in a few\r\nexperiments) a small degree of the negative state, or that which was\r\ncontrary to the state of the inductric ball (1564. 1566.).\r\n\r\n1698. I think it right to say that, as far as I could perceive, the\r\ninsulating character of the cubes used was perfect, or at least so nearly\r\nperfect, as to bear a comparison with shell-lac, glass, &c. (1255). As to\r\nthe cause of the differences, other than regular crystalline structure,\r\nthere may be several. Thus minute fissures in the crystal insensible to the\r\neye may be so disposed as to produce a sensible electrical difference\r\n(1193.). Or the crystallization may be irregular; or the substance may not\r\nbe quite pure; and if we consider how minute a quantity of matter will\r\nalter greatly the conducting power of water, it will seem not unlikely that\r\na little extraneous matter diffused through the whole or part of a cube,\r\nmay produce effects sufficient to account for all the irregularities of\r\naction that have been observed.\r\n\r\n1699. An important inquiry regarding the electrical polarity of the\r\nparticles of an insulating dielectric, is, whether it be the molecules of\r\nthe particular substance acted on, or the component or ultimate particles,\r\nwhich thus act the part of insulated conducting polarizing portions\r\n(1669.).\r\n\r\n1700. The conclusion I have arrived at is, that it is the molecules of the\r\nsubstance which polarize as wholes (1347.); and that however complicated\r\nthe composition of a body may be, all those particles or atoms which are\r\nheld together by chemical affinity to form one molecule of the resulting\r\nbody act as one conducting mass or particle when inductive phenomena and\r\npolarization are produced in the substance of which it is a part.\r\n\r\n1701. This conclusion is founded on several considerations. Thus if we\r\nobserve the insulating and conducting power of elements when they are used\r\nas dielectrics, we find some, as sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, iodine,\r\n&c., whose particles insulate, and therefore polarize in a high degree;\r\nwhereas others, as the metals, give scarcely any indication of possessing a\r\nsensible proportion of this power (1328.), their particles freely\r\nconducting one to another. Yet when these enter into combination they form\r\nsubstances having no direct relation apparently, in this respect, to their\r\nelements; for water, sulphuric acid, and such compounds formed of\r\ninsulating elements, conduct by comparison freely; whilst oxide of lead,\r\nflint glass, borate of lead, and other metallic compounds containing very\r\nhigh proportions of conducting matter, insulate excellently well. Taking\r\noxide of lead therefore as the illustration, I conceive that it is not the\r\nparticles of oxygen and lead which polarize separately under the act of\r\ninduction, but the molecules of oxide of lead which exhibit this effect,\r\nall the elements of one particle of the resulting body, being held together\r\nas parts of one conducting individual by the bonds of chemical affinity;\r\nwhich is but another term for electrical force (918.).\r\n\r\n1702. In bodies which are electrolytes we have still further reason for\r\nbelieving in such a state of things. Thus when water, chloride of tin,\r\niodide of lead, &c. in the solid state are between the electrodes of the\r\nvoltaic battery, their particles polarize as those of any other insulating\r\ndielectric do (1164.); but when the liquid state is conferred on these\r\nsubstances, the polarized particles divide, the two halves, each in a\r\nhighly charged state, travelling onwards until they meet other particles in\r\nan opposite and equally charged state, with which they combine, to the\r\nneutralization of their chemical, i.e. their electrical forces, and the\r\nreproduction of compound particles, which can again polarize as wholes, and\r\nagain divide to repeat the same series of actions (1347.).\r\n\r\n1703. But though electrolytic particles polarize as wholes, it would appear\r\nvery evident that in them it is not a matter of entire indifference _how_\r\nthe particle polarizes (1689.), since, when free to move (380, &c.) the\r\npolarities are ultimately distributed in reference to the elements; and\r\nsums of force equivalent to the polarities, and very definite in kind and\r\namount, separate, as it were, from each other, and travel onwards with the\r\nelementary particles. And though I do not pretend to know what an atom is,\r\nor how it is associated or endowed with electrical force, or how this force\r\nis arranged in the cases of combination and decomposition, yet the strong\r\nbelief I have in the electrical polarity of particles when under inductive\r\naction, and the hearing of such an opinion on the general effects of\r\ninduction, whether ordinary or electrolytic, will be my excuse, I trust,\r\nfor a few hypothetical considerations.\r\n\r\n1704 In electrolyzation it appears that the polarized particles would\r\n(because of the gradual change which has been induced upon the chemical,\r\ni.e. the electrical forces of their elements (918.)) rather divide than\r\ndischarge to each other without division (1348.); for if their division,\r\ni.e. their decomposition and recombination, be prevented by giving them the\r\nsolid state, then they will insulate electricity perhaps a hundredfold more\r\nintense than that necessary for their electrolyzation (419, &c.). Hence the\r\ntension necessary for direct conduction in such bodies appears to be much\r\nhigher than that for decomposition (419. 1164. 1344.).\r\n\r\n1705. The remarkable stoppage of electrolytic conduction by solidification\r\n(380. 1358.), is quite consistent with these views of the dependence of\r\nthat process on the polarity which is common to all insulating matter when\r\nunder induction, though attended by such peculiar electro-chemical results\r\nin the case of electrolytes. Thus it may be expected that the first effect\r\nof induction is so to polarize and arrange the particles of water that the\r\npositive or hydrogen pole of each shall be from the positive electrode and\r\ntowards the negative electrode, whilst the negative or oxygen pole of each\r\nshall be in the contrary direction; and thus when the oxygen and hydrogen\r\nof a particle of water have separated, passing to and combining with other\r\nhydrogen and oxygen particles, unless these new particles of water could\r\nturn round they could not take up that position necessary for their\r\nsuccessful electrolytic polarization. Now solidification, by fixing the\r\nwater particles and preventing them from assuming that essential\r\npreliminary position, prevents also their electrolysis (413.); and so the\r\ntransfer of forces in that manner being prevented (1347. 1703.), the\r\nsubstance acts as an ordinary insulating dielectric (for it is evident by\r\nformer experiments (419. 1704.) that the insulating tension is higher than\r\nthe electrolytic tension), induction through it rises to a higher degree,\r\nand the polar condition of the molecules as wholes, though greatly exalted,\r\nis still securely maintained.\r\n\r\n1706. When decomposition happens in a fluid electrolyte, I do not suppose\r\nthat all the molecules in the same sectional plane (1634.) part with and\r\ntransfer their electrified particles or elements at once. Probably the\r\n_discharge force_ for that plane is summed up on one or a few particles,\r\nwhich decomposing, travelling and recombining, restore the balance of\r\nforces, much as in the case of spark disruptive discharge (1406.); for as\r\nthose molecules resulting from particles which have just transferred power\r\nmust by their position (1705.) be less favourably circumstanced than\r\nothers, so there must be some which are most favourably disposed, and\r\nthese, by giving way first, will for the time lower the tension and produce\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n1707. In former investigations of the action of electricity (821, &c.) it\r\nwas shown, from many satisfactory cases, that the quantity of electric\r\npower transferred onwards was in proportion to and was definite for a given\r\nquantity of matter moving as anion or cathion onwards in the electrolytic\r\nline of action; and there was strong reason to believe that each of the\r\nparticles of matter then dealt with, had associated with it a definite\r\namount of electrical force, constituting its force of chemical affinity,\r\nthe chemical equivalents and the electro-chemical equivalents being the\r\nsame (836.). It was also found with few, and I may now perhaps say with no\r\nexceptions (1341.), that only those compounds containing elements in single\r\nproportions could exhibit the characters and phenomena of electrolytes\r\n(697.); oxides, chlorides, and other bodies containing more than one\r\nproportion of the electro-negative element refusing to decompose under the\r\ninfluence of the electric current.\r\n\r\n1708. Probable reasons for these conditions and limitations arise out of\r\nthe molecular theory of induction. Thus when a liquid dielectric, as\r\nchloride of tin, consists of molecules, each composed of a single particle\r\nof each of the elements, then as these can convey equivalent opposite\r\nforces by their separation in opposite directions, both decomposition and\r\ntransfer can result. But when the molecules, as in the bichloride of tin,\r\nconsist of one particle or atom of one element, and two of the other, then\r\nthe simplicity with which the particles may be supposed to be arranged and\r\nto act, is destroyed. And, though it may be conceived that when the\r\nmolecules of bichloride of tin are polarized as wholes by the induction\r\nacross them, the positive polar force might accumulate on the one particle\r\nof tin whilst the negative polar force accumulated on the two particles of\r\nchlorine associated with it, and that these might respectively travel right\r\nand left to unite with other two of chlorine and one of tin, in analogy\r\nwith what happens in cases of compounds consisting of single proportions,\r\nyet this is not altogether so evident or probable. For when a particle of\r\ntin combines with two of chlorine, it is difficult to conceive that there\r\nshould not be some relation of the three in the resulting molecule\r\nanalogous to fixed position, the one particle of metal being perhaps\r\nsymmetrically placed in relation to the two of chlorine: and, it is not\r\ndifficult to conceive of such particles that they could not assume that\r\nposition dependent both on their polarity and the relation of their\r\nelements, which appears to be the first step in the process of\r\nelectrolyzation (1345. 1705.).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 21. _Relation of the electric and magnetic forces._\r\n\r\n\r\n1709. I have already ventured a few speculations respecting the probable\r\nrelation of magnetism, as the transverse force of the current, to the\r\ndivergent or transverse force of the lines of inductive action belonging to\r\nstatic electricity (1658, &c.).\r\n\r\n1710. In the further consideration of this subject it appeared to me to be\r\nof the utmost importance to ascertain, if possible, whether this lateral\r\naction which we call magnetism, or sometimes the induction of electrical\r\ncurrents (26. 1048, &c.), is extended to a distance _by the action of the\r\nintermediate particles_ in analogy with the induction of static\r\nelectricity, or the various effects, such as conduction, discharge, &c.,\r\nwhich are dependent on that induction; or, whether its influence at a\r\ndistance is altogether independent of such intermediate particles (1662.).\r\n\r\n1711. I arranged two magneto-electric helices with iron cores end to end,\r\nbut with an interval of an inch and three quarters between them, in which\r\ninterval was placed the end or pole of a bar magnet. It is evident, that on\r\nmoving the magnetic pole from one core towards the other, a current would\r\ntend to form in both helices, in the one because of the lowering, and in\r\nthe other because of the strengthening of the magnetism induced in the\r\nrespective soft iron cores. The helices were connected together, and also\r\nwith a galvanometer, so that these two currents should coincide in\r\ndirection, and tend by their joint force to deflect the needle of the\r\ninstrument. The whole arrangement was so effective and delicate, that\r\nmoving the magnetic pole about the eighth of an inch to and fro two or\r\nthree times, in periods equal to those required for the vibrations of the\r\ngalvanometer needle, was sufficient to cause considerable vibration in the\r\nlatter; thus showing readily the consequence of strengthening the influence\r\nof the magnet on the one core and helix, and diminishing it on the other.\r\n\r\n1712. Then without disturbing the distances of the magnet and cores, plates\r\nof substances were interposed. Thus calling the two cores A and B, a plate\r\nof shell-lac was introduced between the magnetic pole and A for the time\r\noccupied by the needle in swinging one way; then it was withdrawn for the\r\ntime occupied in the return swing; introduced again for another equal\r\nportion of time; withdrawn for another portion, and so on eight or nine\r\ntimes; but not the least effect was observed on the needle. In other cases\r\nthe plate was alternated, i.e. it was introduced between the magnet and A\r\nfor one period of time, withdrawn and introduced between the magnet and B\r\nfor the second period, withdrawn and restored to its first place for the\r\nthird period, and so on, but with no effect on the needle.\r\n\r\n1713. In these experiments _shell-lac_ in plates 0.9 of an inch in\r\nthickness, _sulphur_ in a plate 0.9 of an inch in thickness, and _copper_\r\nin a plate 0.7 of an inch in thickness were used without any effect. And I\r\nconclude that bodies, contrasted by the extremes of conducting and\r\ninsulating power, and opposed to each other as strongly as metals, air, and\r\nsulphur, show no difference with respect to magnetic forces when placed in\r\ntheir lines of action, at least under the circumstances described.\r\n\r\n1714. With a plate of iron, or even a small piece of that metal, as the\r\nhead of a nail, a very different effect was produced, for then the\r\ngalvanometer immediately showed its sensibility, and the perfection of the\r\ngeneral arrangement.\r\n\r\n1715. I arranged matters so that a plate of _copper_ 0.2 of an inch in\r\nthickness, and ten inches in diameter, should have the part near the edge\r\ninterposed between the magnet and the core, in which situation it was first\r\nrotated rapidly, and then held quiescent alternately, for periods according\r\nwith that required for the swinging of the needle; but not the least effect\r\nupon the galvanometer was produced.\r\n\r\n1716. A plate of shell-lac 0.6 of an inch in thickness was applied in the\r\nsame manner, but whether rotating or not it produced no effect.\r\n\r\n1717. Occasionally the plane of rotation was directly across the magnetic\r\ncurve: at other times it was made as oblique as possible; the direction of\r\nthe rotation being also changed in different experiments, but not the least\r\neffect was produced.\r\n\r\n1718. I now removed the helices with their soft iron cores, and replaced\r\nthem by two _flat helices_ wound upon card board, each containing forty-two\r\nfeet of silked copper wire, and having no associated iron. Otherwise the\r\narrangement was as before, and exceedingly sensible; for a very slight\r\nmotion of the magnet between the helices produced an abundant vibration of\r\nthe galvanometer needle.\r\n\r\n1719. The introduction of plates of shell-lac, sulphur, or copper into the\r\nintervals between the magnet and these helices (1713.), produced not the\r\nleast effect, whether the former were quiescent or in rapid revolution\r\n(1715.). So here no evidence of the influence of the intermediate particles\r\ncould be obtained (1710.).\r\n\r\n1720. The magnet was then removed and replaced by a flat helix,\r\ncorresponding to the two former, the three being parallel to each other.\r\nThe middle helix was so arranged that a voltaic current could be sent\r\nthrough it at pleasure. The former galvanometer was removed, and one with a\r\ndouble coil employed, one of the lateral helices being connected with one\r\ncoil, and the other helix with the other coil, in such manner that when a\r\nvoltaic current was sent through the middle helix its inductive action\r\n(26.) on the lateral helices should cause currents in them, having contrary\r\ndirections in the coils of the galvanometer. By a little adjustment of the\r\ndistances these induced currents were rendered exactly equal, and the\r\ngalvanometer needle remained stationary notwithstanding their frequent\r\nproduction in the instrument. I will call the middle coil C, and the\r\nexternal coils A and B.\r\n\r\n1721. A plate of copper 0.7 of an inch thick and six inches square, was\r\nplaced between coils C and B, their respective distances remaining\r\nunchanged; and then a voltaic current from twenty pairs of 4 inch plates\r\nwas sent through the coil C, and intermitted, in periods fitted to produce\r\nan effect on the galvanometer (1712.). if any difference had been produced\r\nin the effect of C on A and B. But notwithstanding the presence of air in\r\none interval and copper in the other, the inductive effect was exactly\r\nalike on the two coils, and as if air had occupied both intervals. So that\r\nnotwithstanding the facility with which any induced currents might form in\r\nthe thick copper plate, the coil outside of it was just as much affected by\r\nthe central helix C as if no such conductor as the copper had been there\r\n(65.).\r\n\r\n1722. Then, for the copper plate was substituted one of sulphur 0.9 of an\r\ninch thick; still the results were exactly the same, i.e. there was no\r\naction at the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n1723. Thus it appears that when a voltaic current in one wire is exerting\r\nits inductive action to produce a contrary or a similar current in a\r\nneighbouring wire, according as the primary current is commencing or\r\nceasing, it makes not the least difference whether the intervening space is\r\noccupied by such insulating bodies as air, sulphur and shell-lac, or such\r\nconducting bodies as copper, and the other non-magnetic metals.\r\n\r\n1724. A correspondent effect was obtained with the like forces when\r\nresident in a magnet thus. A single flat helix (1718.) was connected with a\r\ngalvanometer, and a magnetic pole placed near to it; then by moving the\r\nmagnet to and from the helix, or the helix to and from the magnet, currents\r\nwere produced indicated by the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n1725. The thick copper plate (1721.) was afterwards interposed between the\r\nmagnetic pole and the helix; nevertheless on moving these to and fro,\r\neffects, exactly the same in direction and amount, were obtained as if the\r\ncopper had not been there. So also on introducing a plate of sulphur into\r\nthe interval, not the least influence on the currents produced by motion of\r\nthe magnet or coils could be obtained.\r\n\r\n1726. These results, with many others which I have not thought it needful\r\nto describe, would lead to the conclusion that (judging by the _amount_ of\r\neffect produced at a distance by forces transverse to the electric current,\r\ni.e. magnetic forces,) the intervening matter, and therefore the\r\nintervening particles, have nothing to do with the phenomena; or in other\r\nwords, that though the inductive force of static electricity is transmitted\r\nto a distance by the action of the intermediate particles (1164. 1666.),\r\nthe transverse inductive force of currents, which can also act at a\r\ndistance, is not transmitted by the intermediate particles in a similar\r\nway.\r\n\r\n1727. It is however very evident that such a conclusion cannot be\r\nconsidered as proved. Thus when the metal copper is between the pole and\r\nthe helix (1715. 1719. 1725.) or between the two helices (1721.) we know\r\nthat its particles are affected, and can by proper arrangements make their\r\npeculiar state for the time very evident by the production of either\r\nelectrical or magnetical effects. It seems impossible to consider this\r\neffect on the particles of the intervening matter as independent of that\r\nproduced by the inductric coil or magnet C, on the inducteous coil or core\r\nA (1715. 1721.); for since the inducteous body is equally affected by the\r\ninductric body whether these intervening and affected particles of copper\r\nare present or not (1723. 1725.), such a supposition would imply that the\r\nparticles so affected had no reaction back on the original inductric\r\nforces. The more reasonable conclusion, as it appears to me, is, to\r\nconsider these affected particles as efficient in continuing the action\r\nonwards from the inductric to the inducteous body, and by this very\r\ncommunication producing the effect of _no loss_ of induced power at the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n1728. But then it may be asked what is the relation of the particles of\r\ninsulating bodies, such as air, sulphur, or lac, when _they_ intervene in\r\nthe line of magnetic action? The answer to this is at present merely\r\nconjectural. I have long thought there must be a particular condition of\r\nsuch bodies corresponding to the state which causes currents in metals and\r\nother conductors (26. 53. 191. 201. 213.); and considering that the bodies\r\nare insulators one would expect that state to be one of tension. I have by\r\nrotating non-conducting bodies near magnetic poles and poles near them, and\r\nalso by causing powerful electric currents to be suddenly formed and to\r\ncease around and about insulators in various directions, endeavoured to\r\nmake some such state sensible, but have not succeeded. Nevertheless, as any\r\nsuch state must be of exceedingly low intensity, because of the feeble\r\nintensity of the currents which are used to induce it, it may well be that\r\nthe state may exist, and may be discoverable by some more expert\r\nexperimentalist, though I have not been able to make it sensible.\r\n\r\n1729. It appears to me possible, therefore, and even probable, that\r\nmagnetic action may be communicated to a distance by the action of the\r\nintervening particles, in a manner having a relation to the way in which\r\nthe inductive forces of static electricity are transferred to a distance\r\n(1677.); the intervening particles assuming for the time more or less of a\r\npeculiar condition, which (though with a very imperfect idea) I have\r\nseveral times expressed by the term _electro-tonic state_ (60. 242. 1114.\r\n1661.). I hope it will not be understood that I hold the settled opinion\r\nthat such is the case. I would rather in fact have proved the contrary,\r\nnamely, that magnetic forces are quite independent of the matter\r\nintervening between the inductric and the inductions bodies; but I cannot\r\nget over the difficulty presented by such substances as copper, silver,\r\nlead, gold, carbon, and even aqueous solutions (201. 213.), which though\r\nthey are known to assume a peculiar state whilst intervening between the\r\nbodies acting and acted upon (1727.), no more interfere with the final\r\nresult than those which have as yet had no peculiarity of condition\r\ndiscovered in them.\r\n\r\n1730. A remark important to the whole of this investigation ought to be\r\nmade here. Although I think the galvanometer used as I have described it\r\n(1711. 1720.) is quite sufficient to prove that the final amount of action\r\non each of the two coils or the two cores A and B (1713. 1719.) is equal,\r\nyet there is an effect which _may_ be consequent on the difference of\r\naction of two interposed bodies which it would not show. As time enters as\r\nan element into these actions[A] (125.), it is very possible that the\r\ninduced actions on the helices or cores A, B, though they rise to the same\r\ndegree when air and copper, or air and lac are contrasted as intervening\r\nsubstances, do not do so in the same time; and yet, because of the length\r\nof time occupied by a vibration of the needle, this difference may not be\r\nvisible, both effects rising to their maximum in periods so short as to\r\nmake no sensible portion of that required for a vibration of the needle,\r\nand so exert no visible influence upon it.\r\n\r\n  [A] See Annnles de Chimie, 1833, tom. li. pp. 422, 428.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n1731. If the lateral or transverse force of electrical currents, or what\r\nappears to be the same thing, magnetic power, could be proved to be\r\ninfluential at a distance independently of the intervening contiguous\r\nparticles, then, as it appears to me, a real distinction of a high and\r\nimportant kind, would be established between the natures of these two\r\nforces (1654. 1664.). I do not mean that the powers are independent of each\r\nother and might be rendered separately active, on the contrary they are\r\nprobably essentially associated (1654.), but it by no means follows that\r\nthey are of the same nature. In common statical induction, in conduction,\r\nand in electrolyzation, the forces at the opposite extremities of the\r\nparticles which coincide with the lines of action and have commonly been\r\ndistinguished by the term electric, are polar, and in the cases of\r\ncontiguous particles act only to insensible distances; whilst those which\r\nare transverse to the direction of these lines, and are called magnetic,\r\nare circumferential, act at a distance, and if not through the mediation of\r\nthe intervening particles, have their relations to ordinary matter entirely\r\nunlike those of the electrical forces with which they are associated.\r\n\r\n1732. To decide this question of the identity or distinction of the two\r\nkinds of power, and establish their true relation, would be exceedingly\r\nimportant. The question seems fully within the reach of experiment, and\r\noffers a high reward to him who will attempt its settlement.\r\n\r\n1733. I have already expressed a hope of finding an effect or condition\r\nwhich shall be to statical electricity what magnetic force is to current\r\nelectricity (1658.). If I could have proved to my own satisfaction that\r\nmagnetic forces extended their influence to a distance by the conjoined\r\naction of the intervening particles in a manner analogous to that of\r\nelectrical forces, then I should have thought that the natural tension of\r\nthe lines of inductive action (1659.), or that state so often hinted at as\r\nthe electro-tonic state (1661. 1662.), was this related condition of\r\nstatical electricity.\r\n\r\n1734. It may be said that the state of _no lateral action_ is to static or\r\ninductive force the equivalent of _magnetism_ to current force; but that\r\ncan only be upon the view that electric and magnetic action are in their\r\nnature essentially different (1664.). If they are the same power, the whole\r\ndifference in the results being the consequence of the difference of\r\n_direction_, then the normal or _undeveloped_ state of electric force will\r\ncorrespond with the state of _no lateral action_ of the magnetic state of\r\nthe force; the electric current will correspond with the lateral effects\r\ncommonly called magnetism; but the state of static induction which is\r\nbetween the normal condition and the current will still require a\r\ncorresponding lateral condition in the magnetic series, presenting its own\r\npeculiar phenomena; for it can hardly be supposed that the normal electric,\r\nand the inductive or polarized electric, condition, can both have the same\r\nlateral relation. If magnetism be a separate and a higher relation of the\r\npowers developed, then perhaps the argument which presses for this third\r\ncondition of that force would not be so strong.\r\n\r\n1735. I cannot conclude these general remarks upon the relation of the\r\nelectric and magnetic forces without expressing my surprise at the results\r\nobtained with the copper plate (1724. 1725.). The experiments with the flat\r\nhelices represent one of the simplest cases of the induction of electrical\r\ncurrents (1720.); the effect, as is well known, consisting in the\r\nproduction of a momentary current in a wire at the instant when a current\r\nin the contrary direction begins to pass through a neighbouring parallel\r\nwire, and the production of an equally brief current in the reverse\r\ndirection when the determining current is stopped (26.). Such being the\r\ncase, it seems very extraordinary that this induced current which takes\r\nplace in the helix A when there is only air between A and C (1720.). should\r\nbe equally strong when that air is replaced by an enormous mass of that\r\nexcellently conducting metal copper (1721.). It might have been supposed\r\nthat this mass would have allowed of the formation and discharge of almost\r\nany quantity of currents in it, which the helix C was competent to induce,\r\nand so in some degree have diminished if not altogether prevented the\r\neffect in A: instead of which, though we can hardly doubt that an infinity\r\nof currents are formed at the moment in the copper plate, still not the\r\nsmallest diminution or alteration of the effect in A appears (65.). Almost\r\nthe only way of reconciling this effect with generally received notions is,\r\nas it appears to me, to admit that magnetic action is communicated by the\r\naction of the intervening particles (1729. 1733.).\r\n\r\n1736. This condition of things, which is very remarkable, accords perfectly\r\nwith the effects observed in solid helices where wires are coiled over\r\nwires to the amount of five or six or more layers in succession, no\r\ndiminution of effect on the outer ones being occasioned by those within.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ _22. Note on electrical excitation._\r\n\r\n\r\n1737. That the different modes in which electrical excitement takes place\r\nwill some day or other be reduced under one common law can hardly be\r\ndoubted, though for the present we are bound to admit distinctions. It will\r\nbe a great point gained when these distinctions are, not removed, but\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n1738. The strict relation of the electrical and chemical powers renders the\r\nchemical mode of excitement the most instructive of all, and the case of\r\ntwo isolated combining particles is probably the simplest that we possess.\r\nHere however the action is local, and we still want such a test of\r\nelectricity as shall apply to it, to cases of current electricity, and also\r\nto those of static induction. Whenever by virtue of the previously combined\r\ncondition of some of the acting particles (923.) we are enabled, as in the\r\nvoltaic pile, to expand or convert the local action into a current, then\r\nchemical action can be traced through its variations to the production of\r\n_all_ the phenomena of tension and the static state, these being in every\r\nrespect the same as if the electric forces producing them had been\r\ndeveloped by friction.\r\n\r\n1739. It was Berzelius, I believe, who first spoke of the aptness of\r\ncertain particles to assume opposite states when in presence of each other\r\n(959.). Hypothetically we may suppose these states to increase in intensity\r\nby increased approximation, or by heat, &c. until at a certain point\r\ncombination occurs, accompanied by such an arrangement of the forces of the\r\ntwo particles between themselves as is equivalent to a discharge, producing\r\nat the same time a particle which is throughout a conductor (1700.).\r\n\r\n1740. This aptness to assume an excited electrical state (which is probably\r\npolar in those forming non-conducting matter) appears to be a primary fact,\r\nand to partake of the nature of induction (1162.), for the particles do not\r\nseem capable of retaining their particular state independently of each\r\nother (1177.) or of matter in the opposite state. What appears to be\r\ndefinite about the particles of matter is their assumption of a\r\n_particular_ state, as the positive or negative, in relation to each other,\r\nand not of either one or other indifferently; and also the acquirement of\r\nforce up to a certain amount.\r\n\r\n1741. It is easily conceivable that the same force which causes local\r\naction between two free particles shall produce current force if one of the\r\nparticles is previously in combination, forming part of an electrolyte\r\n(923. 1738.). Thus a particle of zinc, and one of oxygen, when in presence\r\nof each other, exert their inductive forces (1740.), and these at last rise\r\nup to the point of combination. If the oxygen be previously in union with\r\nhydrogen, it is held so combined by an analogous exertion and arrangement\r\nof the forces; and as the forces of the oxygen and hydrogen are for the\r\ntime of combination mutually engaged and related, so when the superior\r\nrelation of the forces between the oxygen and zinc come into play, the\r\ninduction of the former or oxygen towards the metal cannot be brought on\r\nand increased without a corresponding deficiency in its induction towards\r\nthe hydrogen with which it is in combination (for the amount of force in a\r\nparticle is considered as definite), and the latter therefore has its force\r\nturned towards the oxygen of the next particle of water; thus the effect\r\nmay be considered as extended to sensible distances, and thrown into the\r\ncondition of static induction, which being discharged and then removed by\r\nthe action of other particles produces currents.\r\n\r\n1742. In the common voltaic battery, the current is occasioned by the\r\ntendency of the zinc to take the oxygen of the water from the hydrogen, the\r\neffective action being at the place where the oxygen leaves the previously\r\nexisting electrolyte. But Schoenbein has arranged a battery in which the\r\neffective action is at the other extremity of this essential part of the\r\narrangement, namely, where oxygen goes to the electrolyte[A]. The first may\r\nbe considered as a case where the current is put into motion by the\r\nabstraction of oxygen from hydrogen, the latter by that of hydrogen from\r\noxygen. The direction of the electric current is in both cases the same,\r\nwhen referred to the direction in which the elementary particles of the\r\nelectrolyte are moving (923. 962.), and both are equally in accordance with\r\nthe hypothetical view of the inductive action of the particles just\r\ndescribed (1740.).\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Magazine, 1838, xii. 225, 315. also De la Rive's\r\n  results with peroxide of manganese. Annales de Chimie, 1836, lxi. p.\r\n  40.--_Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n1743. In such a view of voltaic excitement, the action of the particles may\r\nbe divided into two parts, that which occurs whilst the force in a particle\r\nof oxygen is rising towards a particle of zinc acting on it, and falling\r\ntowards the particle of hydrogen with which it is associated (this being\r\nthe progressive period of the inductive action), and that which occurs when\r\nthe change of association takes place, and the particle of oxygen leaves\r\nthe hydrogen and combines with the zinc. The former appears to be that\r\nwhich produces the current, or if there be no current, produces the state\r\nof tension at the termination of the battery; whilst the latter, by\r\nterminating for the time the influence of the particles which have been\r\nactive, allows of others coming into play, and so the effect of current is\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n1744. It seems highly probable, that excitement by friction may very\r\nfrequently be of the same character. Wollaston endeavoured to refer such\r\nexcitement to chemical action[A]; but if by chemical action ultimate union\r\nof the acting particles is intended, then there are plenty of cases which\r\nare opposed to such a view. Davy mentions some such, and for my own part I\r\nfeel no difficulty in admitting other means of electrical excitement than\r\nchemical action, especially if by chemical action is meant a final\r\ncombination of the particles.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1801, p. 427.\r\n\r\n1745. Davy refers experimentally to the opposite states which two particles\r\nhaving opposite chemical relations can assume when they are brought into\r\nthe close vicinity of each other, but _not_ allowed to combine[A]. This, I\r\nthink, is the first part of the action already described (1743.); but in my\r\nopinion it cannot give rise to a continuous current unless combination take\r\nplace, so as to allow other particles to act successively in the same\r\nmanner, and not even then unless one set of the particles be present as an\r\nelement of an electrolyte (923. 963.); i.e. mere quiescent contact alone\r\nwithout chemical action does not in such cases produce a _current_.\r\n\r\n  [A] Philosophical Transactions, 1807, p. 31.\r\n\r\n1746. Still it seems very possible that such a relation may produce a high\r\ncharge, and thus give rise to excitement by friction. When two bodies are\r\nrubbed together to produce electricity in the usual way, one at least must\r\nbe an insulator. During the act of rubbing, the particles of opposite kinds\r\nmust be brought more or less closely together, the few which are most\r\nfavourably circumstanced being in such close contact as to be short only of\r\nthat which is consequent upon chemical combination. At such moments they\r\nmay acquire by their mutual induction (1740.) and partial discharge to each\r\nother, very exalted opposite states, and when, the moment after, they are\r\nby the progress of the rub removed from each other's vicinity, they will\r\nretain this state if both bodies be insulators, and exhibit them upon their\r\ncomplete separation.\r\n\r\n1747. All the circumstances attending friction seem to me to favour such a\r\nview. The irregularities of form and pressure will cause that the particles\r\nof the two rubbing surfaces will be at very variable distances, only a few\r\nat once being in that very close relation which is probably necessary for\r\nthe development of the forces; further, those which are nearest at one time\r\nwill be further removed at another, and others will become the nearest, and\r\nso by continuing the friction many will in succession be excited. Finally,\r\nthe lateral direction of the separation in rubbing seems to me the best\r\nfitted to bring many pairs of particles, first of all into that close\r\nvicinity necessary for their assuming the opposite states by relation to\r\neach other, and then to remove them from each other's influence whilst they\r\nretain that state.\r\n\r\n1748. It would be easy, on the same view, to explain hypothetically, how,\r\nif one of the rubbing bodies be a conductor, as the amalgam of an\r\nelectrical machine, the state of the other when it comes from under the\r\nfriction is (as a mass) exalted; but it would be folly to go far into such\r\nspeculation before that already advanced has been confirmed or corrected by\r\nfit experimental evidence. I do not wish it to be supposed that I think all\r\nexcitement by friction is of this kind; on the contrary, certain\r\nexperiments lead me to believe, that in many cases, and perhaps in all,\r\neffects of a thermo-electric nature conduce to the ultimate effect; and\r\nthere are very probably other causes of electric disturbance influential at\r\nthe same time, which we have not as yet distinguished.\r\n\r\n_Royal Institution.\r\nJune, 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nN.B.
