Their father had made them a\r\nsmall play out of the big Shakespeare one, and they had rehearsed it with\r\nhim and with their mother till they could say it by heart. They began\r\nwhere Nick Bottom the weaver comes out of the bushes with a donkey’s head\r\non his shoulder, and finds Titania, Queen of the Fairies, asleep. Then\r\nthey skipped to the part where Bottom asks three little fairies to scratch\r\nhis head and bring him honey, and they ended where he falls asleep in\r\nTitania’s arms. Dan was Puck and Nick Bottom, as well as all three\r\nFairies. He wore a pointy-eared cloth cap for Puck, and a paper donkey’s\r\nhead out of a Christmas cracker—but it tore if you were not careful—for\r\nBottom. Una was Titania, with a wreath of columbines and a foxglove wand.\r\n\r\nThe Theatre lay in a meadow called the Long Slip. A little mill-stream,\r\ncarrying water to a mill two or three fields away, bent round one corner\r\nof it, and in the middle of the bend lay a large old fairy Ring of\r\ndarkened grass, which was their stage. The mill-stream banks, overgrown\r\nwith willow, hazel, and guelder rose made convenient places to wait in\r\ntill your turn came; and a grown-up who had seen it said that Shakespeare\r\nhimself could not have imagined a more suitable setting for his play. They\r\nwere not, of course, allowed to act on Midsummer Night itself, but they\r\nwent down after tea on Midsummer Eve, when the shadows were growing, and\r\nthey took their supper—hard-boiled eggs, Bath Oliver biscuits, and salt in\r\nan envelope—with them. Three Cows had been milked and were grazing\r\nsteadily with a tearing noise that one could hear all down the meadow; and\r\nthe noise of the mill at work sounded like bare feet running on hard\r\nground. A cuckoo sat on a gatepost singing his broken June tune,\r\n‘cuckoo-cuk,’ while a busy kingfisher crossed from the mill-stream to the\r\nbrook which ran on the other side of the meadow. Everything else was a\r\nsort of thick, sleepy stillness smelling of meadow-sweet and dry grass.\r\n\r\nTheir play went beautifully. Dan remembered all his parts—Puck, Bottom,\r\nand the three Fairies—and Una never forgot a word of Titania—not even the\r\ndifficult piece where she tells the Fairies how to feed Bottom with\r\n‘apricocks, ripe figs, and dewberries,’ and all the lines end in ‘ies.’\r\nThey were both so pleased that they acted it three times over from\r\nbeginning to end before they sat down in the unthistly centre of the Ring\r\nto eat eggs and Bath Olivers. This was when they heard a whistle among the\r\nalders on the bank, and they jumped.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: In the very spot where Dan had stood as Puck they now\r\n  saw a small, brown, broad-shouldered, pointy-eared person with a snub\r\n  nose, slanting blue eyes, and a grin that ran right across his\r\n  freckled face.]\r\n\r\nThe bushes parted. In the very spot where Dan had stood as Puck they saw a\r\nsmall, brown, broad-shouldered, pointy-eared person with a snub nose,\r\nslanting blue eyes, and a grin that ran right across his freckled face. He\r\nshaded his forehead as though he were watching Quince, Snout, Bottom, and\r\nthe others rehearsing _Pyramus__ and Thisbe_, and, in a voice as deep as\r\nThree Cows asking to be milked, he began:\r\n\r\n  ‘What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,\r\n  So near the cradle of our fairy Queen?’\r\n\r\nHe stopped, hollowed one hand round his ear, and, with a wicked twinkle in\r\nhis eye, went on:\r\n\r\n  ‘What a play toward? I’ll be auditor,\r\n  An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.’\r\n\r\nThe children looked and gasped. The small thing—he was no taller than\r\nDan’s shoulder—stepped quietly into the Ring.\r\n\r\n‘I’m rather out of practice,’ said he; ‘but that’s the way my part ought\r\nto be played.’\r\n\r\nStill the children stared at him—from his dark blue cap, like a big\r\ncolumbine flower, to his bare, hairy feet. At last he laughed.\r\n\r\n‘Please don’t look like that. It isn’t _my_ fault. What else could you\r\nexpect?’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘We didn’t expect any one,’ Dan answered, slowly. ‘This is our field.’\r\n\r\n‘Is it?’ said their visitor, sitting down. ‘Then what on Human Earth made\r\nyou act _Midsummer Night’s Dream_ three times over, _on_ Midsummer Eve,\r\n_in_ the middle of a Ring, and under—right _under_ one of my oldest hills\r\nin Old England? Pook’s Hill—Puck’s Hill—Puck’s Hill—Pook’s Hill! It’s as\r\nplain as the nose on my face.’\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the bare, fern-covered slope of Pook’s Hill that runs up\r\nfrom the far side of the mill-stream to a dark wood. Beyond that wood the\r\nground rises and rises for five hundred feet, till at last you climb out\r\non the bare top of Beacon Hill, to look over the Pevensey Levels and the\r\nChannel and half the naked South Downs.\r\n\r\n‘By Oak, Ash, and Thorn!’ he cried, still laughing. ‘If this had happened\r\na few hundred years ago you’d have had all the People of the Hills out\r\nlike bees in June!’\r\n\r\n‘We didn’t know it was wrong,’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Wrong!’ The little fellow shook with laughter. ‘Indeed, it isn’t wrong.\r\nYou’ve done something that Kings and Knights and Scholars in old days\r\nwould have given their crowns and spurs and books to find out. If Merlin\r\nhimself had helped you, you couldn’t have managed better! You’ve broken\r\nthe Hills—you’ve broken the Hills! It hasn’t happened in a thousand\r\nyears.’\r\n\r\n‘We—we didn’t mean to,’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Of course you didn’t! That’s just why you did it. Unluckily the Hills are\r\nempty now, and all the People of the Hills are gone. I’m the only one\r\nleft. I’m Puck, the oldest Old Thing in England, very much at your service\r\nif—if you care to have anything to do with me. If you don’t, of course\r\nyou’ve only to say so, and I’ll go.’\r\n\r\nHe looked at the children and the children looked at him for quite half a\r\nminute. His eyes did not twinkle any more. They were very kind, and there\r\nwas the beginning of a good smile on his lips.\r\n\r\nUna put out her hand. ‘Don’t go,’ she said. ‘We like you.’\r\n\r\n‘Have a Bath Oliver,’ said Dan, and he passed over the squashy envelope\r\nwith the eggs.\r\n\r\n‘By Oak, Ash, and Thorn!’ cried Puck, taking off his blue cap, ‘I like you\r\ntoo. Sprinkle a little salt on the biscuit, Dan, and I’ll eat it with you.\r\nThat’ll show you the sort of person I am. Some of us’—he went on, with his\r\nmouth full—‘couldn’t abide Salt, or Horseshoes over a door, or\r\nMountain-ash berries, or Running Water, or Cold Iron, or the sound of\r\nChurch Bells. But I’m Puck!’\r\n\r\nHe brushed the crumbs carefully from his doublet and shook hands.\r\n\r\n‘We always said, Dan and I,’ Una stammered, ‘that if it ever happened we’d\r\nknow ex-actly what to do; but—but now it seems all different somehow.’\r\n\r\n‘She means meeting a fairy,’ said Dan. ‘_I_ never believed in ’em—not\r\nafter I was six, anyhow.’\r\n\r\n‘I did,’ said Una. ‘At least, I sort of half believed till we learned\r\n“Farewell Rewards.” Do you know “Farewell Rewards and Fairies”?’\r\n\r\n‘Do you mean this?’ said Puck. He threw his big head back and began at the\r\nsecond line:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Good housewives now may say,\r\n  For now foul sluts in dairies\r\n    Do fare as well as they;\r\n  For though they sweep their hearths no less\r\n\r\n(‘Join in, Una!’)\r\n\r\n    Than maids were wont to do,\r\n  Yet who of late for cleanliness\r\n    Finds sixpence in her shoe?’\r\n\r\nThe echoes flapped all along the flat meadow.\r\n\r\n‘Of course I know it,’ he said.\r\n\r\n‘And then there’s the verse about the Rings,’ said Dan. ‘When I was little\r\nit always made me feel unhappy in my inside.’\r\n\r\n‘“Witness those rings and roundelays,” do you mean?’ boomed Puck, with a\r\nvoice like a great church organ.\r\n\r\n    ‘Of theirs which yet remain,\r\n  Were footed in Queen Mary’s days\r\n    On many a grassy plain.\r\n  But since of late Elizabeth,\r\n    And later James came in,\r\n  Are never seen on any heath\r\n    As when the time hath been.\r\n\r\n‘It’s some time since I heard that sung, but there’s no good beating about\r\nthe bush: it’s true. The People of the Hills have all left. I saw them\r\ncome into Old England and I saw them go. Giants, trolls, kelpies,\r\nbrownies, goblins, imps; wood, tree, mound, and water spirits;\r\nheath-people, hill-watchers, treasure-guards, good people, little people,\r\npishogues, leprechauns, night-riders, pixies, nixies, gnomes and the\r\nrest—gone, all gone! I came into England with Oak, Ash, and Thorn, and\r\nwhen Oak, Ash, and Thorn are gone I shall go too.’\r\n\r\nDan looked round the meadow—at Una’s oak by the lower gate, at the line of\r\nash trees that overhang Otter Pool where the mill-stream spills over when\r\nthe mill does not need it, and at the gnarled old white-thorn where Three\r\nCows scratched their necks.\r\n\r\n‘It’s all right,’ he said; and added, ‘I’m planting a lot of acorns this\r\nautumn too.’\r\n\r\n‘Then aren’t you most awfully old?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Not old—fairly long-lived, as folk say hereabouts. Let me see—my friends\r\nused to set my dish of cream for me o’ nights when Stonehenge was new.\r\nYes, before the Flint Men made the Dewpond under Chanctonbury Ring.’\r\n\r\nUna clasped her hands, cried ‘Oh!’ and nodded her head.\r\n\r\n‘She’s thought a plan,’ Dan explained. ‘She always does like that when she\r\nthinks a plan.’\r\n\r\n‘I was thinking—suppose we saved some of our porridge and put it in the\r\nattic for you. They’d notice if we left it in the nursery.’\r\n\r\n‘Schoolroom,’ said Dan, quickly, and Una flushed, because they had made a\r\nsolemn treaty that summer not to call the schoolroom the nursery any more.\r\n\r\n‘Bless your heart o’ gold!’ said Puck. ‘You’ll make a fine considering\r\nwench some market-day. I really don’t want you to put out a bowl for me;\r\nbut if ever I need a bite, be sure I’ll tell you.’\r\n\r\nHe stretched himself at length on the dry grass, and the children\r\nstretched out beside him, their bare legs waving happily in the air. They\r\nfelt they could not be afraid of him any more than of their particular\r\nfriend old Hobden, the hedger. He did not bother them with grown-up\r\nquestions, or laugh at the donkey’s head, but lay and smiled to himself in\r\nthe most sensible way.\r\n\r\n‘Have you a knife on you?’ he said at last.\r\n\r\nDan handed over his big one-bladed outdoor knife, and Puck began to carve\r\nout a piece of turf from the centre of the Ring.\r\n\r\n‘What’s that for—Magic?’ said Una, as he pressed up the square of\r\nchocolate loam that cut like so much cheese.\r\n\r\n‘One of my little Magics,’ he answered, and cut another. ‘You see, I can’t\r\nlet you into the Hills because the People of the Hills have gone; but if\r\nyou care to take seizin from me, I may be able to show you something out\r\nof the common here on Human Earth. You certainly deserve it.’\r\n\r\n‘What’s taking seizin?’ said Dan, cautiously.\r\n\r\n‘It’s an old custom the people had when they bought and sold land. They\r\nused to cut out a clod and hand it over to the buyer, and you weren’t\r\nlawfully seized of your land—it didn’t really belong to you—till the other\r\nfellow had actually given you a piece of it—like this.’ He held out the\r\nturves.\r\n\r\n‘But it’s our own meadow,’ said Dan, drawing back. ‘Are you going to magic\r\nit away?’\r\n\r\nPuck laughed. ‘I know it’s your meadow, but there’s a great deal more in\r\nit than you or your father ever guessed. Try!’\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes on Una.\r\n\r\n‘I’ll do it,’ she said. Dan followed her example at once.\r\n\r\n‘Now are you two lawfully seized and possessed of all Old England,’ began\r\nPuck, in a sing-song voice. ‘By Right of Oak, Ash, and Thorn are you free\r\nto come and go and look and know where I shall show or best you please.\r\nYou shall see What you shall see and you shall hear What you shall hear,\r\nthough It shall have happened three thousand year; and you shall know\r\nneither Doubt nor Fear. Fast! Hold fast all I give you.’\r\n\r\nThe children shut their eyes, but nothing happened.\r\n\r\n‘Well?’ said Una, disappointedly opening them. ‘I thought there would be\r\ndragons.’\r\n\r\n‘Though It shall have happened three thousand year,’ said Puck, and\r\ncounted on his fingers. ‘No; I’m afraid there were no dragons three\r\nthousand years ago.’\r\n\r\n‘But there hasn’t happened anything at all,’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Wait awhile,’ said Puck. ‘You don’t grow an oak in a year—and Old\r\nEngland’s older than twenty oaks. Let’s sit down again and think. _I_ can\r\ndo that for a century at a time.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, but you are a fairy,’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Have you ever heard me use that word yet?’ said Puck, quickly.\r\n\r\n‘No. You talk about “the People of the Hills,” but you never say\r\n“fairies,”’ said Una. ‘I was wondering at that. Don’t you like it?’\r\n\r\n‘How would you like to be called “mortal” or “human being” all the time?’\r\nsaid Puck; ‘or “son of Adam” or “daughter of Eve”?’\r\n\r\n‘I shouldn’t like it at all,’ said Dan. ‘That’s how the Djinns and Afrits\r\ntalk in the _Arabian Nights_.’\r\n\r\n‘And that’s how _I_ feel about saying—that word that I don’t say. Besides,\r\nwhat you call _them_ are made-up things the People of the Hills have never\r\nheard of—little buzzflies with butterfly wings and gauze petticoats, and\r\nshiny stars in their hair, and a wand like a schoolteacher’s cane for\r\npunishing bad boys and rewarding good ones. _I_ know ’em!’\r\n\r\n‘We don’t mean that sort,’ said Dan. ‘We hate ’em too.’\r\n\r\n‘Exactly,’ said Puck. ‘Can you wonder that the People of the Hills don’t\r\ncare to be confused with that painty-winged, wand-waving,\r\nsugar-and-shake-your-head set of impostors? Butterfly wings, indeed! I’ve\r\nseen Sir Huon and a troop of his people setting off from Tintagel Castle\r\nfor Hy-Brasil in the teeth of a sou’-westerly gale, with the spray flying\r\nall over the castle, and the Horses of the Hill wild with fright. Out\r\nthey’d go in a lull, screaming like gulls, and back they’d be driven five\r\ngood miles inland before they could come head to wind again.\r\nButterfly-wings! It was Magic—Magic as black as Merlin could make it, and\r\nthe whole sea was green fire and white foam with singing mermaids in it.\r\nAnd the Horses of the Hill picked their way from one wave to another by\r\nthe lightning flashes! _That_ was how it was in the old days!’\r\n\r\n‘Splendid,’ said Dan, but Una shuddered.\r\n\r\n‘I’m glad they’re gone, then; but what made the People of the Hills go\r\naway?’ Una asked.\r\n\r\n‘Different things. I’ll tell you one of them some day—the thing that made\r\nthe biggest flit of any,’ said Puck. ‘But they didn’t all flit at once.\r\nThey dropped off, one by one, through the centuries. Most of them were\r\nforeigners who couldn’t stand our climate. _They_ flitted early.’\r\n\r\n‘How early?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘A couple of thousand years or more. The fact is they began as Gods. The\r\nPhœnicians brought some over when they came to buy tin; and the Gauls, and\r\nthe Jutes, and the Danes, and the Frisians, and the Angles brought more\r\nwhen they landed. They were always landing in those days, or being driven\r\nback to their ships, and they always brought their Gods with them. England\r\nis a bad country for Gods. Now, _I_ began as I mean to go on. A bowl of\r\nporridge, a dish of milk, and a little quiet fun with the country folk in\r\nthe lanes was enough for me then, as it is now. I belong here, you see,\r\nand I have been mixed up with people all my days. But most of the others\r\ninsisted on being Gods, and having temples, and altars, and priests, and\r\nsacrifices of their own.’\r\n\r\n‘People burned in wicker baskets?’ said Dan. ‘Like Miss Blake tells us\r\nabout?’\r\n\r\n‘All sorts of sacrifices,’ said Puck. ‘If it wasn’t men, it was horses, or\r\ncattle, or pigs, or metheglin—that’s a sticky, sweet sort of beer. _I_\r\nnever liked it. They were a stiff-necked, extravagant set of idols, the\r\nOld Things. But what was the result? Men don’t like being sacrificed at\r\nthe best of times; they don’t even like sacrificing their farm-horses.\r\nAfter a while men simply left the Old Things alone, and the roofs of their\r\ntemples fell in, and the Old Things had to scuttle out and pick up a\r\nliving as they could. Some of them took to hanging about trees, and hiding\r\nin graves and groaning o’ nights. If they groaned loud enough and long\r\nenough they might frighten a poor countryman into sacrificing a hen, or\r\nleaving a pound of butter for them. I remember one Goddess called\r\nBelisama. She became a common wet water-spirit somewhere in Lancashire.\r\nAnd there were hundreds of other friends of mine. First they were Gods.\r\nThen they were People of the Hills, and then they flitted to other places\r\nbecause they couldn’t get on with the English for one reason or another.\r\nThere was only one Old Thing, I remember, who honestly worked for his\r\nliving after he came down in the world. He was called Weland, and he was a\r\nsmith to some Gods. I’ve forgotten their names, but he used to make them\r\nswords and spears. I think he claimed kin with Thor of the Scandinavians.’\r\n\r\n‘_Heroes of Asgard_ Thor?’ said Una. She had been reading the book.\r\n\r\n‘Perhaps,’ answered Puck. ‘None the less, when bad times came, he didn’t\r\nbeg or steal. He worked; and I was lucky enough to be able to do him a\r\ngood turn.’\r\n\r\n‘Tell us about it,’ said Dan. ‘I think I like hearing of Old Things.’\r\n\r\nThey rearranged themselves comfortably, each chewing a grass stem. Puck\r\npropped himself on one strong arm and went on:\r\n\r\n‘Let’s think! I met Weland first on a November afternoon in a sleet storm,\r\non Pevensey Level——’\r\n\r\n‘Pevensey? Over the hill, you mean?’ Dan pointed south.\r\n\r\n‘Yes; but it was all marsh in those days, right up to Horsebridge and\r\nHydeneye. I was on Beacon Hill—they called it Brunanburgh then—when I saw\r\nthe pale flame that burning thatch makes, and I went down to look. Some\r\npirates—I think they must have been Peofn’s men—were burning a village on\r\nthe Levels, and Weland’s image—a big, black wooden thing with amber beads\r\nround its neck—lay in the bows of a black thirty-two-oar galley that they\r\nhad just beached. Bitter cold it was! There were icicles hanging from her\r\ndeck, and the oars were glazed over with ice, and there was ice on\r\nWeland’s lips. When he saw me he began a long chant in his own tongue,\r\ntelling me how he was going to rule England, and how I should smell the\r\nsmoke of his altars from Lincolnshire to the Isle of Wight. _I_ didn’t\r\ncare! I’d seen too many Gods charging into Old England to be upset about\r\nit. I let him sing himself out while his men were burning the village, and\r\nthen I said (I don’t know what put it into my head), “Smith of the Gods,”\r\nI said, “the time comes when I shall meet you plying your trade for hire\r\nby the wayside.”’\r\n\r\n‘What did Weland say?’ said Una. ‘Was he angry?’\r\n\r\n‘He called me names and rolled his eyes, and I went away to wake up the\r\npeople inland. But the pirates conquered the country, and for centuries\r\nWeland was a most important God. He had temples everywhere—from\r\nLincolnshire to the Isle of Wight, as he said—and his sacrifices were\r\nsimply scandalous. To do him justice, he preferred horses to men; but men\r\n_or_ horses, I knew that presently he’d have to come down in the\r\nworld—like the other Old Things. I gave him lots of time—I gave him about\r\na thousand years—and at the end of ’em I went into one of his temples near\r\nAndover to see how he prospered. There was his altar, and there was his\r\nimage, and there were his priests, and there were the congregation, and\r\neverybody seemed quite happy, except Weland and the priests. In the old\r\ndays the congregation were unhappy until the priests had chosen their\r\nsacrifices; and so would _you_ have been. When the service began a priest\r\nrushed out, dragged a man up to the altar, pretended to hit him on the\r\nhead with a little gilt axe, and the man fell down and pretended to die.\r\nThen everybody shouted: “A sacrifice to Weland! A sacrifice to Weland!”’\r\n\r\n‘And the man wasn’t really dead?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Not a bit. All as much pretence as a dolls’ tea-party. Then they brought\r\nout a splendid white horse, and the priest cut some hair from its mane and\r\ntail and burned it on the altar, shouting, “A sacrifice!” That counted the\r\nsame as if a man and a horse had been killed. I saw poor Weland’s face\r\nthrough the smoke, and I couldn’t help laughing. He looked so disgusted\r\nand so hungry, and all he had to satisfy himself was a horrid smell of\r\nburning hair. Just a dolls’ tea-party!\r\n\r\n‘I judged it better not to say anything then (’twouldn’t have been fair),\r\nand the next time I came to Andover, a few hundred years later, Weland and\r\nhis temple were gone, and there was a Christian bishop in a Church there.\r\nNone of the People of the Hills could tell me anything about him, and I\r\nsupposed that he had left England.’ Puck turned; lay on the other elbow,\r\nand thought for a long time.\r\n\r\n‘Let’s see,’ he said at last. ‘It must have been some few years later—a\r\nyear or two before the Conquest, I think—that I came back to Pook’s Hill\r\nhere, and one evening I heard old Hobden talking about Weland’s Ford.’\r\n\r\n‘If you mean old Hobden the hedger, he’s only seventy-two. He told me so\r\nhimself,’ said Dan. ‘He’s a intimate friend of ours.’\r\n\r\n‘You’re quite right,’ Puck replied. ‘I meant old Hobden’s ninth\r\ngreat-grandfather. He was a free man and burned charcoal hereabouts. I’ve\r\nknown the family, father and son, so long that I get confused sometimes.\r\nHob of the Dene was my Hobden’s name, and he lived at the Forge cottage.\r\nOf course, I pricked up my ears when I heard Weland mentioned, and I\r\nscuttled through the woods to the Ford just beyond Bog Wood yonder.’ He\r\njerked his head westward, where the valley narrows between wooded hills\r\nand steep hop-fields.\r\n\r\n‘Why, that’s Willingford Bridge,’ said Una. ‘We go there for walks often.\r\nThere’s a kingfisher there.’\r\n\r\n‘It was Weland’s Ford then, dear. A road led down to it from the Beacon on\r\nthe top of the hill—a shocking bad road it was—and all the hillside was\r\nthick, thick oak-forest, with deer in it. There was no trace of Weland,\r\nbut presently I saw a fat old farmer riding down from the Beacon under the\r\ngreenwood tree. His horse had cast a shoe in the clay, and when he came to\r\nthe Ford he dismounted, took a penny out of his purse, laid it on a stone,\r\ntied the old horse to an oak, and called out: “Smith, Smith, here is work\r\nfor you!” Then he sat down and went to sleep. You can imagine how _I_ felt\r\nwhen I saw a white-bearded, bent old blacksmith in a leather apron creep\r\nout from behind the oak and begin to shoe the horse. It was Weland\r\nhimself. I was so astonished that I jumped out and said: “What on Human\r\nEarth are you doing here, Weland?”’\r\n\r\n‘Poor Weland!’ sighed Una.\r\n\r\n‘He pushed the long hair back from his forehead (he didn’t recognise me at\r\nfirst). Then he said: “_You_ ought to know. You foretold it, Old Thing.\r\nI’m shoeing horses for hire. I’m not even Weland now,” he said. “They call\r\nme Wayland-Smith.”’\r\n\r\n‘Poor chap!’ said Dan. ‘What did you say?’\r\n\r\n‘What could I say? He looked up, with the horse’s foot on his lap, and he\r\nsaid, smiling, “I remember the time when I wouldn’t have accepted this old\r\nbag of bones as a sacrifice, and now I’m glad enough to shoe him for a\r\npenny.”\r\n\r\n‘“Isn’t there any way for you to get back to Valhalla, or wherever you\r\ncome from?” I said.\r\n\r\n‘“I’m afraid not,” he said, rasping away at the hoof. He had a wonderful\r\ntouch with horses. The old beast was whinnying on his shoulder. “You may\r\nremember that I was not a gentle God in my Day and my Time and my Power. I\r\nshall never be released till some human being truly wishes me well.”\r\n\r\n‘“Surely,” said I, “the farmer can’t do less than that. You’re shoeing the\r\nhorse all round for him.”\r\n\r\n‘“Yes,” said he, “and my nails will hold a shoe from one full moon to the\r\nnext. But farmers and Weald Clay,” said he, “are both uncommon cold and\r\nsour.”\r\n\r\n‘Would you believe it, that when that farmer woke and found his horse shod\r\nhe rode away without one word of thanks? I was so angry that I wheeled his\r\nhorse right round and walked him back three miles to the Beacon just to\r\nteach the old sinner politeness.’\r\n\r\n‘Were you invisible?’ said Una. Puck nodded, gravely.\r\n\r\n‘The Beacon was always laid in those days ready to light, in case the\r\nFrench landed at Pevensey; and I walked the horse about and about it that\r\nlee-long summer night. The farmer thought he was bewitched—well, he _was_,\r\nof course—and began to pray and shout. _I_ didn’t care! I was as good a\r\nChristian as he any fair-day in the County, and about four o’clock in the\r\nmorning a young novice came along from the monastery that used to stand on\r\nthe top of Beacon hill.’\r\n\r\n‘What’s a novice?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘It really means a man who is beginning to be a monk, but in those days\r\npeople sent their sons to a monastery just the same as a school. This\r\nyoung fellow had been to a monastery in France for a few months every\r\nyear, and he was finishing his studies in the monastery close to his home\r\nhere. Hugh was his name, and he had got up to go fishing hereabouts. His\r\npeople owned all this valley. Hugh heard the farmer shouting, and asked\r\nhim what in the world he meant. The old man spun him a wonderful tale\r\nabout fairies and goblins and witches; and I _know_ he hadn’t seen a thing\r\nexcept rabbits and red deer all that night. (The People of the Hills are\r\nlike otters—they don’t show except when they choose.) But the novice\r\nwasn’t a fool. He looked down at the horse’s feet, and saw the new shoes\r\nfastened as only Weland knew how to fasten ’em. (Weland had a way of\r\nturning down the nails that folks called the Smith’s Clinch.)\r\n\r\n‘“H’m!” said the novice. “Where did you get your horse shod?”\r\n\r\n‘The farmer wouldn’t tell him at first, because the priests never liked\r\ntheir people to have any dealings with the Old Things. At last he\r\nconfessed that the Smith had done it. “What did you pay him?” said the\r\nnovice. “Penny,” said the farmer, very sulkily. “That’s less than a\r\nChristian would have charged,” said the novice. “I hope you threw a ‘Thank\r\nyou’ into the bargain.” “No,” said the farmer; “Wayland-Smith’s a\r\nheathen.” “Heathen or no heathen,” said the novice, “you took his help,\r\nand where you get help there you must give thanks.” “What?” said the\r\nfarmer—he was in a furious temper because I was walking the old horse in\r\ncircles all this time—“What, you young jackanapes?” said he. “Then by your\r\nreasoning I ought to say ‘Thank you’ to Satan if he helped me?” “Don’t\r\nroll about up there splitting reasons with me,” said the novice. “Come\r\nback to the Ford and thank the Smith, or you’ll be sorry.”\r\n\r\n‘Back the farmer had to go! I led the horse, though no one saw me, and the\r\nnovice walked beside us, his gown swishing through the shiny dew and his\r\nfishing-rod across his shoulders spearwise. When we reached the Ford\r\nagain—it was five o’clock and misty still under the oaks—the farmer simply\r\nwouldn’t say “Thank you.” He said he’d tell the Abbot that the novice\r\nwanted him to worship heathen gods. Then Hugh the novice lost his temper.\r\nHe just cried, “Out!” put his arm under the farmer’s fat leg, and heaved\r\nhim from his saddle on to the turf, and before he could rise he caught him\r\nby the back of the neck and shook him like a rat till the farmer growled,\r\n“Thank you, Wayland-Smith.”’\r\n\r\n‘Did Weland see all this?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, yes, and he shouted his old war-cry when the farmer thudded on to the\r\nground. He was delighted. Then the novice turned to the oak and said, “Ho!\r\nSmith of the Gods, I am ashamed of this rude farmer; but for all you have\r\ndone in kindness and charity to him and to others of our people, I thank\r\nyou and wish you well.” Then he picked up his fishing-rod—it looked more\r\nlike a tall spear than ever—and tramped off down your valley.’\r\n\r\n‘And what did poor Weland do?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘He laughed and cried with joy, because he had been released at last, and\r\ncould go away. But he was an honest Old Thing. He had worked for his\r\nliving and he paid his debts before he left. “I shall give that novice a\r\ngift,” said Weland. “A gift that shall do him good the wide world over,\r\nand Old England after him. Blow up my fire, Old Thing, while I get the\r\niron for my last task.” Then he made a sword—a dark grey, wavy-lined\r\nsword—and I blew the fire while he hammered. By Oak, Ash, and Thorn, I\r\ntell you, Weland was a Smith of the Gods! He cooled that sword in running\r\nwater twice, and the third time he cooled it in the evening dew, and he\r\nlaid it out in the moonlight and said Runes (that’s charms) over it, and\r\nhe carved Runes of Prophecy on the blade. “Old Thing,” he said to me,\r\nwiping his forehead, “this is the best blade that Weland ever made. Even\r\nthe user will never know how good it is. Come to the monastery.”\r\n\r\n‘We went to the dormitory where the monks slept. We saw the novice fast\r\nasleep in his cot, and Weland put the sword into his hand, and I remember\r\nthe young fellow gripped it in his sleep. Then Weland strode as far as he\r\ndared into the Chapel and threw down all his shoeing-tools—his hammer, and\r\npincers, and rasps—to show that he had done with them for ever. It sounded\r\nlike suits of armour falling, and the sleepy monks ran in, for they\r\nthought the monastery had been attacked by the French. The novice came\r\nfirst of all, waving his new sword and shouting Saxon battle-cries. When\r\nthey saw the shoeing-tools they were very bewildered, till the novice\r\nasked leave to speak, and told what he had done to the farmer, and what he\r\nhad said to Wayland-Smith, and how, though the dormitory light was\r\nburning, he had found the wonderful rune-carved sword in his cot.\r\n\r\n‘The Abbot shook his head at first, and then he laughed and said to the\r\nnovice: “Son Hugh, it needed no sign from a heathen God to show me that\r\nyou will never be a monk. Take your sword, and keep your sword, and go\r\nwith your sword, and be as gentle as you are strong and courteous. We will\r\nhang up the Smith’s tools before the Altar,” he said, “because, whatever\r\nthe Smith of the Gods may have been in the old days, we know that he\r\nworked honestly for his living and made gifts to Mother Church.” Then they\r\nwent to bed again, all except the novice, and he sat up in the garth\r\nplaying with his sword. Then Weland said to me by the stables: “Farewell,\r\nOld Thing; you had the right of it. You saw me come to England, and you\r\nsee me go. Farewell!”\r\n\r\n‘With that he strode down the hill to the corner of the Great Woods—Woods\r\nCorner, you call it now—to the very place where he had first landed—and I\r\nheard him moving through the thickets towards Horsebridge for a little,\r\nand then he was gone. That was how it happened. I saw it.’\r\n\r\nBoth children drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n‘But what happened to Hugh the novice?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘And the sword?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\nPuck looked down the meadow that lay all quiet and cool in the shadow of\r\nPook’s Hill. A corncrake jarred in a hay-field near by, and the small\r\ntrouts of the brook began to jump. A big white moth flew unsteadily from\r\nthe alders and flapped round the children’s heads, and the least little\r\nhaze of water-mist rose from the brook.\r\n\r\n‘Do you really want to know?’ Puck said.\r\n\r\n‘We do,’ cried the children. ‘Awfully!’\r\n\r\n‘Very good. I promised you that you shall see What you shall see, and you\r\nshall hear What you shall hear, though It shall have happened three\r\nthousand year; but just now it seems to me that, unless you go back to the\r\nhouse, people will be looking for you. I’ll walk with you as far as the\r\ngate.’\r\n\r\n‘Will you be here when we come again?’ they asked.\r\n\r\n‘Surely, sure-ly,’ said Puck. ‘I’ve been here some time already. One\r\nminute first, please.’\r\n\r\nHe gave them each three leaves—one of Oak, one of Ash, and one of Thorn.\r\n\r\n‘Bite these,’ said he. ‘Otherwise you might be talking at home of what\r\nyou’ve seen and heard, and—if I know human beings—they’d send for the\r\ndoctor. Bite!’\r\n\r\nThey bit hard, and found themselves walking side by side to the lower\r\ngate. Their father was leaning over it.\r\n\r\n‘And how did your play go?’ he asked.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, splendidly,’ said Dan. ‘Only afterwards, I think, we went to sleep.\r\nIt was very hot and quiet. Don’t you remember, Una?’\r\n\r\nUna shook her head and said nothing.\r\n\r\n‘I see,’ said her father.\r\n\r\n  ‘Late—late in the evening Kilmeny came home,\r\n  For Kilmeny had been she could not tell where,\r\n  And Kilmeny had seen what she could not declare.\r\n\r\nBut why are you chewing leaves at your time of life, daughter? For fun?’\r\n\r\n‘No. It was for something, but I can’t azactly remember,’ said Una.\r\n\r\nAnd neither of them could till—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TREE SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Of all the trees that grow so fair,_\r\n    _Old England to adorn,_\r\n  _Greater are none beneath the Sun,_\r\n    _Than Oak, and Ash, and Thorn._\r\n  _Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good Sirs_\r\n    _(All of a Midsummer morn)!_\r\n  _Surely we sing no little thing,_\r\n    _In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!_\r\n\r\n  _Oak of the Clay lived many a day,_\r\n    _Or ever Æneas began;_\r\n  _Ash of the Loam was a lady at home,_\r\n    _When Brut was an outlaw man;_\r\n  _Thorn of the Down saw New Troy Town_\r\n    _(From which was London born);_\r\n  _Witness hereby the ancientry_\r\n    _Of Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!_\r\n\r\n  _Yew that is old in churchyard mould,_\r\n    _He breedeth a mighty bow;_\r\n  _Alder for shoes do wise men choose,_\r\n    _And beech for cups also._\r\n  _But when ye have killed, and your bowl is spilled,_\r\n    _And your shoes are clean outworn,_\r\n  _Back ye must speed for all that ye need,_\r\n    _To Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!_\r\n\r\n  _Ellum she hateth mankind, and waiteth_\r\n    _Till every gust be laid,_\r\n  _To drop a limb on the head of him,_\r\n    _That anyway trusts her shade_\r\n  _But whether a lad be sober or sad,_\r\n    _Or mellow with ale from the horn,_\r\n  _He will take no wrong when he lieth along_\r\n    _’Neath Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!_\r\n\r\n  _Oh, do not tell the Priest our plight,_\r\n    _Or he would call it a sin;_\r\n  _But—we have been out in the woods all night_\r\n    _A-conjuring Summer in!_\r\n  _And we bring you news by word of mouth—_\r\n    _Good news for cattle and corn—_\r\n  _Now is the Sun come up from the South,_\r\n    _With Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!_\r\n\r\n  _Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good Sirs_\r\n    _(All of a Midsummer morn)!_\r\n  _England shall bide till Judgment Tide,_\r\n    _By Oak, and Ash and Thorn!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG MEN AT THE MANOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG MEN AT THE MANOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were fishing, a few days later, in the bed of the brook that for\r\ncenturies had cut deep into the soft valley soil. The trees closing\r\noverhead made long tunnels through which the sunshine worked in blobs and\r\npatches. Down in the tunnels were bars of sand and gravel, old roots and\r\ntrunks covered with moss or painted red by the irony water; foxgloves\r\ngrowing lean and pale towards the light; clumps of fern and thirsty shy\r\nflowers who could not live away from moisture and shade. In the pools you\r\ncould see the wave thrown up by the trouts as they charged hither and yon,\r\nand the pools were joined to each other—except in flood time, when all was\r\none brown rush—by sheets of thin broken water that poured themselves\r\nchuckling round the darkness of the next bend.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the children’s most secret hunting-grounds, and their\r\nparticular friend, old Hobden the hedger, had shown them how to use it.\r\nExcept for the click of a rod hitting a low willow, or a switch and tussle\r\namong the young ash-leaves as a line hung up for the minute, nobody in the\r\nhot pasture could have guessed what game was going on among the trouts\r\nbelow the banks.\r\n\r\n‘We’s got half-a-dozen,’ said Dan, after a warm, wet hour. ‘I vote we go\r\nup to Stone Bay and try Long Pool.’\r\n\r\nUna nodded—most of her talk was by nods—and they crept from the gloom of\r\nthe tunnels towards the tiny weir that turns the brook into the\r\nmill-stream. Here the banks are low and bare, and the glare of the\r\nafternoon sun on the Long Pool below the weir makes your eyes ache.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the open they nearly fell down with astonishment. A huge\r\ngrey horse, whose tail-hairs crinkled the glassy water, was drinking in\r\nthe pool, and the ripples about his muzzle flashed like melted gold. On\r\nhis back sat an old, white-haired man dressed in a loose glimmery gown of\r\nchain-mail. He was bareheaded, and a nut-shaped iron helmet hung at his\r\nsaddle-bow. His reins were of red leather five or six inches deep,\r\nscalloped at the edges, and his high padded saddle with its red girths was\r\nheld fore and aft by a red leather breastband and crupper.\r\n\r\n‘Look!’ said Una, as though Dan were not staring his very eyes out. ‘It’s\r\nlike the picture in your room—“Sir Isumbras at the Ford.”’\r\n\r\nThe rider turned towards them, and his thin, long face was just as sweet\r\nand gentle as that of the knight who carries the children in that picture.\r\n\r\n‘They should be here now, Sir Richard,’ said Puck’s deep voice among the\r\nwillow-herb.\r\n\r\n‘They are here,’ the knight said, and he smiled at Dan with the string of\r\ntrouts in his hand. ‘There seems no great change in boys since mine fished\r\nthis water.’\r\n\r\n‘If your horse has drunk, we shall be more at ease in the Ring,’ said\r\nPuck; and he nodded to the children as though he had never magicked away\r\ntheir memories the week before.\r\n\r\nThe great horse turned and hoisted himself into the pasture with a kick\r\nand a scramble that tore the clods down rattling.\r\n\r\n‘Your pardon!’ said Sir Richard to Dan. ‘When these lands were mine, I\r\nnever loved that mounted men should cross the brook except by the paved\r\nford. But my Swallow here was thirsty, and I wished to meet you.’\r\n\r\n‘We’re very glad you’ve come, sir,’ said Dan. ‘It doesn’t matter in the\r\nleast about the banks.’\r\n\r\nHe trotted across the pasture on the sword-side of the mighty horse, and\r\nit was a mighty iron-handled sword that swung from Sir Richard’s belt. Una\r\nwalked behind with Puck. She remembered everything now.\r\n\r\n‘I’m sorry about the Leaves,’ he said, ‘but it would never have done if\r\nyou had gone home and told, would it?’\r\n\r\n‘I s’pose not,’ Una answered. ‘But you said that all the fair—People of\r\nthe Hills had left England.’\r\n\r\n‘So they have; but I told you that you should come and go and look and\r\nknow, didn’t I? The knight isn’t a fairy. He’s Sir Richard Dalyngridge, a\r\nvery old friend of mine. He came over with William the Conqueror, and he\r\nwants to see you particularly.’\r\n\r\n‘What for?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘On account of your great wisdom and learning,’ Puck replied, without a\r\ntwinkle.\r\n\r\n‘Us?’ said Una. ‘Why, I don’t know my Nine Times—not to say it dodging;\r\nand Dan makes the most _awful_ mess of fractions. He can’t mean _us_!’\r\n\r\n‘Una!’ Dan called back. ‘Sir Richard says he is going to tell what\r\nhappened to Weland’s sword. He’s got it. Isn’t it splendid?’\r\n\r\n‘Nay—nay,’ said Sir Richard, dismounting as they reached the Ring, in the\r\nbend of the mill-stream bank. ‘It is you that must tell me, for I hear the\r\nyoungest child in our England to-day is as wise as our wisest clerk.’ He\r\nslipped the bit out of Swallow’s mouth, dropped the ruby-red reins over\r\nhis head, and the wise horse moved off to graze.\r\n\r\nSir Richard (they noticed he limped a little) unslung his great sword.\r\n\r\n‘That’s it,’ Dan whispered to Una.\r\n\r\n‘This is the sword that Brother Hugh had from Wayland-Smith,’ Sir Richard\r\nsaid. ‘Once he gave it to me, but I would not take it; but at the last it\r\nbecame mine after such a fight as never christened man fought. See!’ He\r\nhalf drew it from its sheath and turned it before them. On either side\r\njust below the handle, where the Runic letters shivered as though they\r\nwere alive, were two deep gouges in the dull, deadly steel. ‘Now, what\r\nThing made those?’ said he. ‘I know not, but you, perhaps, can say.’\r\n\r\n‘Tell them all the tale, Sir Richard,’ said Puck. ‘It concerns their land\r\nsomewhat.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, from the very beginning,’ Una pleaded, for the knight’s good face\r\nand the smile on it more than ever reminded her of ‘Sir Isumbras at the\r\nFord.’\r\n\r\nThey settled down to listen, Sir Richard bare-headed to the sunshine,\r\ndandling the sword in both hands, while the grey horse cropped outside the\r\nRing, and the helmet on the saddle-bow clinged softly each time he jerked\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n‘From the beginning, then,’ Sir Richard said, ‘since it concerns your\r\nland, I will tell the tale. When our Duke came out of Normandy to take his\r\nEngland, great knights (have ye heard?) came and strove hard to serve the\r\nDuke, because he promised them lands here, and small knights followed the\r\ngreat ones. My folk in Normandy were poor; but a great knight, Engerrard\r\nof the Eagle—Engenulf De Aquila—who was kin to my father, followed the\r\nEarl of Mortain, who followed William the Duke, and I followed De Aquila.\r\nYes, with thirty men-at-arms out of my father’s house and a new sword, I\r\nset out to conquer England three days after I was made knight. I did not\r\nthen know that England would conquer me. We went up to Santlache with the\r\nrest—a very great host of us.’\r\n\r\n‘Does that mean the Battle of Hastings—Ten Sixty-Six?’ Una whispered, and\r\nPuck nodded, so as not to interrupt.\r\n\r\n‘At Santlache, over the hill yonder’—he pointed south-eastward towards\r\nFairlight—‘we found Harold’s men. We fought. At the day’s end they ran. My\r\nmen went with De Aquila’s to chase and plunder, and in that chase\r\nEngerrard of the Eagle was slain, and his son Gilbert took his banner and\r\nhis men forward. This I did not know till after, for Swallow here was cut\r\nin the flank, so I stayed to wash the wound at a brook by a thorn. There a\r\nsingle Saxon cried out to me in French, and we fought together. I should\r\nhave known his voice, but we fought together. For a long time neither had\r\nany advantage, till by pure ill-fortune his foot slipped and his sword\r\nflew from his hand. Now I had but newly been made knight, and wished,\r\nabove all, to be courteous and fameworthy, so I forebore to strike and\r\nbade him get his sword again. “A plague on my sword,” said he. “It has\r\nlost me my first fight. You have spared my life. Take my sword.” He held\r\nit out to me, but as I stretched my hand the sword groaned like a stricken\r\nman, and I leaped back crying, “Sorcery!”\r\n\r\n[The children looked at the sword as though it might speak again.]\r\n\r\n‘Suddenly a clump of Saxons ran out upon me and, seeing a Norman alone,\r\nwould have killed me, but my Saxon cried out that I was his prisoner, and\r\nbeat them off. Thus, see you, he saved my life. He put me on my horse and\r\nled me through the woods ten long miles to this valley.’\r\n\r\n‘To here, d’you mean?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘To this very valley. We came in by the Lower Ford under the King’s Hill\r\nyonder’—he pointed eastward where the valley widens.\r\n\r\n‘And was that Saxon Hugh the novice?’ Dan asked.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, and more than that. He had been for three years at the monastery at\r\nBec by Rouen, where’—Sir Richard chuckled—‘the Abbot Herluin would not\r\nsuffer me to remain.’\r\n\r\n‘Why wouldn’t he?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Because I rode my horse into the refectory, when the scholars were at\r\nmeat, to show the Saxon boys we Normans were not afraid of an abbot. It\r\nwas that very Saxon Hugh tempted me to do it, and we had not met since\r\nthat day. I thought I knew his voice even inside my helmet, and, for all\r\nthat our Lords fought, we each rejoiced we had not slain the other. He\r\nwalked by my side, and he told me how a Heathen God, as he believed, had\r\ngiven him his sword, but he said he had never heard it sing before. I\r\nremember I warned him to beware of sorcery and quick enchantments.’ Sir\r\nRichard smiled to himself. ‘I was very young—very young!\r\n\r\n‘When we came to his house here we had almost forgotten that we had been\r\nat blows. It was near midnight, and the Great Hall was full of men and\r\nwomen waiting news. There I first saw his sister, the Lady Ælueva, of whom\r\nhe had spoken to us in France. She cried out fiercely at me, and would\r\nhave had me hanged in that hour, but her brother said that I had spared\r\nhis life—he said not how he saved mine from his Saxons—and that our Duke\r\nhad won the day; and even while they wrangled over my poor body, of a\r\nsudden he fell down in a swoon from his wounds.\r\n\r\n‘“This is _thy fault_,” said the Lady Ælueva to me, and she kneeled above\r\nhim and called for wine and cloths.\r\n\r\n‘“If I had known,” I answered, “he should have ridden and I walked. But he\r\nset me on my horse; he made no complaint; he walked beside me and spoke\r\nmerrily throughout. I pray I have done him no harm.”\r\n\r\n‘“Thou hast need to pray,” she said, catching up her underlip. “If he\r\ndies, thou shalt hang!”\r\n\r\n‘They bore off Hugh to his chamber; but three tall men of the house bound\r\nme and set me under the beam of the Great Hall with a rope round my neck.\r\nThe end of the rope they flung over the beam, and they sat them down by\r\nthe fire to wait word whether Hugh lived or died. They cracked nuts with\r\ntheir knife-hilts the while.’\r\n\r\n‘And how did you feel?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Very weary; but I did heartily pray for my schoolmate Hugh his health.\r\nAbout noon I heard horses in the valley, and the three men loosed my ropes\r\nand fled out, and De Aquila’s men rode up. Gilbert de Aquila came with\r\nthem, for it was his boast that, like his father, he forgot no man that\r\nserved him. He was little, like his father, but terrible, with a nose like\r\nan eagle’s nose and yellow eyes like an eagle. He rode tall\r\nwar-horses—roans, which he bred himself—and he could never abide to be\r\nhelped into the saddle. He saw the rope hanging from the beam and laughed,\r\nand his men laughed, for I was too stiff to rise.\r\n\r\n‘“This is poor entertainment for a Norman knight,” he said, “but, such as\r\nit is, let us be grateful. Show me, boy, to whom thou owest most, and we\r\nwill pay them out of hand.”’\r\n\r\n‘What did he mean? To kill ’em?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Assuredly. But I looked at the Lady Ælueva where she stood among her\r\nmaids, and her brother beside her. De Aquila’s men had driven them all\r\ninto the Great Hall.’\r\n\r\n‘Was she pretty?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘In all my life I had never seen woman fit to strew rushes before my Lady\r\nÆlueva,’ the knight replied, quite simply and quietly. ‘As I looked at her\r\nI thought I might save her and her house by a jest.\r\n\r\n‘“Seeing that I came somewhat hastily and without warning,” said I to De\r\nAquila, “I have no fault to find with the courtesy that these Saxons have\r\nshown me.” But my voice shook. It is—it was not good to jest with that\r\nlittle man.\r\n\r\n‘All were silent awhile, till De Aquila laughed. “Look, men—a miracle!”\r\nsaid he. “The fight is scarce sped, my father is not yet buried, and here\r\nwe find our youngest knight already set down in his Manor, while his\r\nSaxons—ye can see it in their fat faces—have paid him homage and service!\r\nBy the Saints,” he said, rubbing his nose, “I never thought England would\r\nbe so easy won! Surely I can do no less than give the lad what he has\r\ntaken. This Manor shall be thine, boy,” he said, “till I come again, or\r\ntill thou art slain. Now, mount, men, and ride. We follow our Duke into\r\nKent to make him King of England.”\r\n\r\n‘He drew me with him to the door while they brought his horse—a lean roan,\r\ntaller than my Swallow here, but not so well girthed.\r\n\r\n‘“Hark to me,” he said, fretting with his great war-gloves. “I have given\r\nthee this Manor, which is a Saxon hornets’ nest, and I think thou wilt be\r\nslain in a month—as my father was slain. Yet if thou canst keep the roof\r\non the hall, the thatch on the barn, and the plough in the furrow till I\r\ncome back, thou shalt hold the Manor from me; for the Duke has promised\r\nour Earl Mortain all the lands by Pevensey, and Mortain will give me of\r\nthem what he would have given my father. God knows if thou or I shall live\r\ntill England is won; but remember, boy, that here and now fighting is\r\nfoolishness and”—he reached for the reins—“craft and cunning is all.”\r\n\r\n‘“Alas, I have no cunning,” said I.\r\n\r\n‘“Not yet,” said he, hopping abroad, foot in stirrup, and poking his horse\r\nin the belly with his toe. “Not yet, but I think thou hast a good teacher.\r\nFarewell! Hold the Manor and live. Lose the Manor and hang,” he said, and\r\nspurred out, his shield-straps squeaking behind him.\r\n\r\n‘So, children, here was I, little more than a boy, and Santlache fight not\r\ntwo days old, left alone with my thirty men-at-arms, in a land I knew not,\r\namong a people whose tongue I could not speak, to hold down the land which\r\nI had taken from them.’\r\n\r\n‘And that was here at home?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Yes, here. See! From the Upper Ford, Weland’s Ford, to the Lower Ford, by\r\nthe Belle Allée, west and east it ran half a league. From the Beacon of\r\nBrunanburgh behind us here, south and north it ran a full league—and all\r\nthe woods were full of broken men from Santlache, Saxon thieves, Norman\r\nplunderers, robbers, and deerstealers. A hornets’ nest indeed!\r\n\r\n‘When De Aquila had gone, Hugh would have thanked me for saving their\r\nlives; but Lady Ælueva said that I had done it only for the sake of\r\nreceiving the Manor.\r\n\r\n‘“How could I know that De Aquila would give it me?” I said. “If I had\r\ntold him I had spent my night in your halter he would have burned the\r\nplace twice over by now.”\r\n\r\n‘“If any man had put _my_ neck in a rope,” she said, “I would have seen\r\nhis house burned thrice over before _I_ would have made terms.”\r\n\r\n‘“But it was a woman,” I said; and I laughed and she wept and said that I\r\nmocked her in her captivity.\r\n\r\n‘“Lady,” said I, “there is no captive in this valley except one, and he is\r\nnot a Saxon.”\r\n\r\n‘At this she cried that I was a Norman thief, who came with false, sweet\r\nwords, having intended from the first to turn her out in the fields to beg\r\nher bread. Into the fields! She had never seen the face of war!\r\n\r\n‘I was angry, and answered, “This much at least I can disprove, for I\r\nswear”—and on my sword-hilt I swore it in that place—“I swear I will never\r\nset foot in the Great Hall till the Lady Ælueva herself shall summon me\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n‘She went away, saying nothing, and I walked out, and Hugh limped after\r\nme, whistling dolorously (that is a custom of the English), and we came\r\nupon the three Saxons that had bound me. They were now bound by my\r\nmen-at-arms, and behind them stood some fifty stark and sullen churls of\r\nthe House and the Manor, waiting to see what should fall. We heard De\r\nAquila’s trumpets blow thin through the woods Kentward.\r\n\r\n‘“Shall we hang these?” said my men.\r\n\r\n‘“Then my churls will fight,” said Hugh, beneath his breath; but I bade\r\nhim ask the three what mercy they hoped for.\r\n\r\n‘“None,” said they all. “She bade us hang thee if our master died. And we\r\nwould have hanged thee. There is no more to it.”\r\n\r\n‘As I stood doubting a woman ran down from the oak wood above the King’s\r\nHill yonder, and cried out that some Normans were driving off the swine\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n‘“Norman or Saxon,” said I, “we must beat them back, or they will rob us\r\nevery day. Out at them with any arms ye have!” So I loosed those three\r\ncarles and we ran together, my men-at-arms and the Saxons with bills and\r\nbows which they had hidden in the thatch of their huts, and Hugh led them.\r\nHalf-way up the King’s Hill we found a false fellow from Picardy—a sutler\r\nthat sold wine in the Duke’s camp—with a dead knight’s shield on his arm,\r\na stolen horse under him, and some ten or twelve wastrels at his tail, all\r\ncutting and slashing at the pigs. We beat them off, and saved our pork.\r\nOne hundred and seventy pigs we saved in that great battle.’ Sir Richard\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n‘That, then, was our first work together, and I bade Hugh tell his folk\r\nthat so would I deal with any man, knight or churl, Norman or Saxon, who\r\nstole as much as one egg from our valley. Said he to me, riding home:\r\n“Thou hast gone far to conquer England this evening.” I answered: “England\r\nmust be thine and mine, then. Help me, Hugh, to deal aright with this\r\npeople. Make them to know that if they slay me De Aquila will surely send\r\nto slay them, and he will put a worse man in my place.” “That may well be\r\ntrue,” said he, and gave me his hand. “Better the devil we know than the\r\ndevil we know not, till we can pack you Normans home.” And so, too, said\r\nhis Saxons; and they laughed as we drove the pigs downhill. But I think\r\nsome of them, even then, began not to hate me.’\r\n\r\n‘I like Brother Hugh,’ said Una, softly.\r\n\r\n‘Beyond question he was the most perfect, courteous, valiant, tender, and\r\nwise knight that ever drew breath,’ said Richard, caressing the sword. ‘He\r\nhung up his sword—this sword—on the wall of the Great Hall, because he\r\nsaid it was fairly mine, and never he took it down till De Aquila\r\nreturned, as I shall presently show. For three months his men and mine\r\nguarded the valley, till all robbers and nightwalkers learned there was\r\nnothing to get from us save hard tack and a hanging. Side by side we\r\nfought against all who came—thrice a week sometimes we fought—against\r\nthieves and landless knights looking for good manors. Then we were in some\r\npeace, and I made shift by Hugh’s help to govern the valley—for all this\r\nvalley of yours was my Manor—as a knight should. I kept the roof on the\r\nhall and the thatch on the barn, but.... The English are a bold people.\r\nHis Saxons would laugh and jest with Hugh, and Hugh with them, and—this\r\nwas marvellous to me—if even the meanest of them said that such and such a\r\nthing was the Custom of the Manor, then straightway would Hugh and such\r\nold men of the Manor as might be near forsake everything else to debate\r\nthe matter—I have seen them stop the mill with the corn half ground—and if\r\nthe custom or usage were proven to be as it was said, why, that was the\r\nend of it, even though it were flat against Hugh, his wish and command.\r\nWonderful!’\r\n\r\n‘Aye,’ said Puck, breaking in for the first time. ‘The Custom of Old\r\nEngland was here before your Norman knights came, and it outlasted them,\r\nthough they fought against it cruel.’\r\n\r\n‘Not I,’ said Richard. ‘I let the Saxons go their stubborn way, but when\r\nmy own men-at-arms, Normans not six months in England, stood up and told\r\nme what was the custom of the country, _then_ I was angry. Ah, good days!\r\nAh, wonderful people! And I loved them all.’\r\n\r\nThe knight lifted his arms as though he would hug the whole dear valley,\r\nand Swallow, hearing the chink of his chain-mail, looked up and whinnied\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n‘At last,’ he went on, ‘after a year of striving and contriving and some\r\nlittle driving, De Aquila came to the valley, alone and without warning. I\r\nsaw him first at the Lower Ford, with a swine-herd’s brat on his\r\nsaddle-bow.\r\n\r\n‘“There is no need for thee to give any account of thy stewardship,” said\r\nhe. “I have it all from the child here.” And he told me how the young\r\nthing had stopped his tall horse at the Ford, by waving of a branch, and\r\ncrying that the way was barred. “And if one bold, bare babe be enough to\r\nguard the Ford in these days, thou hast done well,” said he, and puffed\r\nand wiped his head.\r\n\r\nHe pinched the child’s cheek, and looked at our cattle in the flat by the\r\nbrook.\r\n\r\n‘“Both fat,” said he, rubbing his nose. “This is craft and cunning such as\r\nI love. What did I tell thee when I rode away, boy?”\r\n\r\n‘“Hold the Manor or hang,” said I. I had never forgotten it.\r\n\r\n‘“True. And thou hast held.” He clambered from his saddle and with sword’s\r\npoint cut out a turf from the bank and gave it me where I kneeled.’\r\n\r\nDan looked at Una, and Una looked at Dan.\r\n\r\n‘That’s seizin,’ said Puck, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n‘“Now thou art lawfully seized of the Manor, Sir Richard,” said he—’twas\r\nthe first time he ever called me that—“thou and thy heirs for ever. This\r\nmust serve till the King’s clerks write out thy title on a parchment.\r\nEngland is all ours—if we can hold it.”\r\n\r\n‘“What service shall I pay?” I asked, and I remember I was proud beyond\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n‘“Knight’s fee, boy, knight’s fee!” said he, hopping round his horse on\r\none foot. (Have I said he was little, and could not endure to be helped to\r\nhis saddle?) “Six mounted men or twelve archers thou shalt send me\r\nwhenever I call for them, and—where got you that corn?” said he, for it\r\nwas near harvest, and our corn stood well. “I have never seen such bright\r\nstraw. Send me three bags of the same seed yearly, and furthermore, in\r\nmemory of our last meeting—with the rope round thy neck—entertain me and\r\nmy men for two days of each year in the Great Hall of thy Manor.”\r\n\r\n‘“Alas!” said I, “then my Manor is already forfeit. I am under vow not to\r\nenter the Great Hall.” And I told him what I had sworn to the Lady\r\nÆlueva.’\r\n\r\n‘And hadn’t you ever been into the house since?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Never,’ Sir Richard answered smiling. ‘I had made me a little hut of wood\r\nup the hill, and there I did justice and slept.... De Aquila wheeled\r\naside, and his shield shook on his back. “No matter, boy,” said he. “I\r\nwill remit the homage for a year.”’\r\n\r\n‘He meant Sir Richard needn’t give him dinner there the first year,’ Puck\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n‘De Aquila stayed with me in the hut and Hugh, who could read and write\r\nand cast accounts, showed him the roll of the Manor, in which were written\r\nall the names of our fields and men, and he asked a thousand questions\r\ntouching the land, the timber, the grazing, the mill, and the fish-ponds,\r\nand the worth of every man in the valley. But never he named the Lady\r\nÆlueva’s name, nor went he near the Great Hall. By night he drank with us\r\nin the hut. Yes, he sat on the straw like an eagle ruffled in her\r\nfeathers, his yellow eyes rolling above the cup, and he pounced in his\r\ntalk like an eagle, swooping from one thing to another, but always binding\r\nfast. Yes; he would lie still awhile, and then rustle in the straw, and\r\nspeak sometimes as though he were King William himself, and anon he would\r\nspeak in parables and tales, and if at once we saw not his meaning he\r\nwould yerk us in the ribs with his scabbarded sword.\r\n\r\n‘“Look you, boys,” said he, “I am born out of my due time. Five hundred\r\nyears ago I would have made all England such an England as neither Dane,\r\nSaxon, nor Norman should have conquered. Five hundred years hence I should\r\nhave been such a councillor to Kings as the world hath never dreamed of.\r\n’Tis all here,” said he, tapping his big head, “but it hath no play in\r\nthis black age. Now Hugh here is a better man than thou art, Richard.” He\r\nhad made his voice harsh and croaking, like a raven’s.\r\n\r\n‘“Truth,” said I. “But for Hugh, his help and patience and long-suffering,\r\nI could never have kept the Manor.”\r\n\r\n‘“Nor thy life either,” said De Aquila. “Hugh has saved thee not once, but\r\na hundred times. Be still, Hugh!” he said. “Dost thou know, Richard, why\r\nHugh slept, and why he still sleeps, among thy Norman men-at-arms?”\r\n\r\n‘“To be near me,” said I, for I thought this was truth.\r\n\r\n‘“Fool!” said De Aquila. “It is because his Saxons have begged him to rise\r\nagainst thee, and to sweep every Norman out of the valley. No matter how I\r\nknow. It is truth. Therefore Hugh hath made himself an hostage for thy\r\nlife, well knowing that if any harm befell thee from his Saxons thy\r\nNormans would slay him without remedy. And this his Saxons know. It is\r\ntrue, Hugh?”\r\n\r\n‘“In some sort,” said Hugh, shamefacedly; “at least, it was true half a\r\nyear ago. My Saxons would not harm Richard now. I think they know him; but\r\nI judged it best to make sure.”\r\n\r\n‘Look, children, what that man had done—and I had never guessed it! Night\r\nafter night had he lain down among my men-at-arms, knowing that if one\r\nSaxon had lifted knife against me his life would have answered for mine.\r\n\r\n‘“Yes,” said De Aquila. “And he is a swordless man.” He pointed to Hugh’s\r\nbelt, for Hugh had put away his sword—did I tell you?—the day after it\r\nflew from his hand at Santlache. He carried only the short knife and the\r\nlong-bow. “Swordless and landless art thou, Hugh; and they call thee kin\r\nto Earl Godwin.” (Hugh was indeed of Godwin’s blood.) “The Manor that was\r\nthine was given to this boy and to his children for ever. Sit up and beg,\r\nfor he can turn thee out like a dog, Hugh!”\r\n\r\n‘Hugh said nothing, but I heard his teeth grind, and I bade De Aquila, my\r\nown overlord, hold his peace, or I would stuff his words down his throat.\r\nThen De Aquila laughed till the tears ran down his face.\r\n\r\n‘“I warned the King,” said he, “what would come of giving England to us\r\nNorman thieves. Here art thou, Richard, less than two days confirmed in\r\nthy Manor, and already thou hast risen against thy overlord. What shall we\r\ndo to him, _Sir_ Hugh?”\r\n\r\n‘“I am a swordless man,” said Hugh. “Do not jest with me,” and he laid his\r\nhead on his knees and groaned.\r\n\r\n‘“The greater fool thou,” said De Aquila, and all his voice changed; “for\r\nI have given thee the Manor of Dallington up the hill this half-hour\r\nsince,” and he yerked at Hugh with his scabbard across the straw.\r\n\r\n‘“To me?” said Hugh. “I am a Saxon, and, except that I love Richard here,\r\nI have not sworn fealty to any Norman.”\r\n\r\n‘“In God’s good time, which because of my sins I shall not live to see,\r\nthere will be neither Saxon nor Norman in England,” said De Aquila. “If I\r\nknow men, thou art more faithful unsworn than a score of Normans I could\r\nname. Take Dallington, and join Sir Richard to fight me to-morrow, if it\r\nplease thee!”\r\n\r\n‘“Nay,” said Hugh. “I am no child. Where I take a gift, there I render\r\nservice”; and he put his hands between De Aquila’s, and swore to be\r\nfaithful, and, as I remember, I kissed him, and De Aquila kissed us both.\r\n\r\n‘We sat afterwards outside the hut while the sun rose, and De Aquila\r\nmarked our churls going to their work in the fields, and talked of holy\r\nthings, and how we should govern our Manors in time to come, and of\r\nhunting and of horse-breeding, and of the King’s wisdom and unwisdom; for\r\nhe spoke to us as though we were in all sorts now his brothers. Anon a\r\nchurl stole up to me—he was one of the three I had not hanged a year\r\nago—and he bellowed—which is the Saxon for whispering—that the Lady Ælueva\r\nwould speak to me at the Great House. She walked abroad daily in the\r\nManor, and it was her custom to send me word whither she went, that I\r\nmight set an archer or two behind and in front to guard her. Very often I\r\nmyself lay up in the woods and watched on her also.\r\n\r\n‘I went swiftly, and as I passed the great door it opened from within, and\r\nthere stood my Lady Ælueva, and she said to me: “Sir Richard, will it\r\nplease you enter your Great Hall?” Then she wept, but we were alone.’\r\n\r\nThe knight was silent for a long time, his face turned across the valley,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, well done!’ said Una, and clapped her hands very softly. ‘She was\r\nsorry, and she said so.’\r\n\r\n‘Aye, she was sorry, and she said so,’ said Sir Richard, coming back with\r\na little start. ‘Very soon—but _he_ said it was two full hours later—De\r\nAquila rode to the door, with his shield new scoured (Hugh had cleansed\r\nit), and demanded entertainment, and called me a false knight, that would\r\nstarve his overlord to death. Then Hugh cried out that no man should work\r\nin the valley that day, and our Saxons blew horns, and set about feasting\r\nand drinking, and running of races, and dancing and singing; and De Aquila\r\nclimbed upon a horse-block and spoke to them in what he swore was good\r\nSaxon, but no man understood it. At night we feasted in the Great Hall,\r\nand when the harpers and the singers were gone we four sat late at the\r\nhigh table. As I remember, it was a warm night with a full moon, and De\r\nAquila bade Hugh take down his sword from the wall again, for the honour\r\nof the Manor of Dallington, and Hugh took it gladly enough. Dust lay on\r\nthe hilt, for I saw him blow it off.\r\n\r\n‘She and I sat talking a little apart, and at first we thought the harpers\r\nhad come back, for the Great Hall was filled with a rushing noise of\r\nmusic. De Aquila leaped up; but there was only the moonlight fretty on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n‘“Hearken!” said Hugh. “It is my sword,” and as he belted it on the music\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n‘“Over Gods, forbid that I should ever belt blade like that,” said De\r\nAquila. “What does it foretell?”\r\n\r\n‘“The Gods that made it may know. Last time it spoke was at Hastings, when\r\nI lost all my lands. Belike it sings now that I have new lands and am a\r\nman again,” said Hugh.\r\n\r\n‘He loosed the blade a little and drove it back happily into the sheath,\r\nand the sword answered him low and crooningly, as—as a woman would speak\r\nto a man, her head on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n‘Now that was the second time in all my life I heard this Sword sing.’...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Look!’ said Una. ‘There’s mother coming down the Long Slip. What will she\r\nsay to Sir Richard? She can’t help seeing him.’\r\n\r\n‘And Puck can’t magic us this time,’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Are you sure?’ said Puck; and he leaned forward and whispered to Sir\r\nRichard, who, smiling, bowed his head.\r\n\r\n‘But what befell the sword and my brother Hugh I will tell on another\r\ntime,’ said he, rising. ‘Ohé, Swallow!’\r\n\r\nThe great horse cantered up from the far end of the meadow, close to\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThey heard mother say: ‘Children, Gleason’s old horse has broken into the\r\nmeadow again. Where did he get through?’\r\n\r\n‘Just below Stone Bay,’ said Dan. ‘He tore down simple flobs of the bank!\r\nWe noticed it just now. And we’ve caught no end of fish. We’ve been at it\r\nall the afternoon.’\r\n\r\nAnd they honestly believed that they had. They never noticed the Oak, Ash,\r\nand Thorn leaves that Puck had slyly thrown into their laps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD’S SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n  _I followed my Duke ere I was a lover,_\r\n    _To take from England fief and fee;_\r\n  _But now this game is the other way over—_\r\n    _But now England hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n  _I had my horse, my shield and banner,_\r\n    _And a boy’s heart, so whole and free;_\r\n  _But now I sing in another manner—_\r\n    _But now England hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n  _As for my Father in his tower,_\r\n    _Asking news of my ship at sea;_\r\n  _He will remember his own hour—_\r\n    _Tell him England hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n  _As for my Mother in her bower,_\r\n    _That rules my Father so cunningly;_\r\n  _She will remember a maiden’s power—_\r\n    _Tell her England hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n  _As for my Brother in Rouen city,_\r\n    _A nimble and naughty page is he;_\r\n  _But he will come to suffer and pity—_\r\n    _Tell him England hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n  _As for my little Sister waiting_\r\n    _In the pleasant orchards of Normandie;_\r\n  _Tell her youth is the time for mating—_\r\n    _Tell her England hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n  _As for my Comrades in camp and highway,_\r\n    _That lift their eyebrows scornfully;_\r\n  _Tell them their way is not my way—_\r\n    _Tell them England hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n  _Kings and Princes and Barons famed,_\r\n    _Knights and Captains in your degree;_\r\n  _Hear me a little before I am blamed—_\r\n    _Seeing England hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n  _Howso great man’s strength be reckoned,_\r\n    _There are two things he cannot flee;_\r\n  _Love is the first, and Death is the second—_\r\n    _And Love, in England, hath taken me!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTS OF THE JOYOUS VENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARP SONG OF THE DANE WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\n  _What is a woman that you forsake her,_\r\n  _And the hearth-fire and the home-acre,_\r\n  _To go with the old grey Widow-maker_?\r\n\r\n  _She has no house to lay a guest in—_\r\n  _But one chill bed for all to rest in,_\r\n  _That the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in._\r\n\r\n  _She has no strong white arms to fold you,_\r\n  _But the ten-times-fingering weed to hold you_\r\n  _Bound on the rocks where the tide has rolled you._\r\n\r\n  _Yet, when the signs of summer thicken,_\r\n  _And the ice breaks, and the birch-buds quicken,_\r\n  _Yearly you turn from our side, and sicken—_\r\n\r\n  _Sicken again for the shouts and the slaughters,_\r\n  _You steal away to the lapping waters,_\r\n  _And look at your ship in her winter quarters._\r\n\r\n  _You forget our mirth, and talk at the tables,_\r\n  _The kine in the shed and the horse in the stables—_\r\n  _To pitch her sides and go over her cables!_\r\n\r\n  _Then you drive out where the storm-clouds swallow:_\r\n  _And the sound of your oar-blades falling hollow,_\r\n  _Is all we have left through the months to follow!_\r\n\r\n  _Ah, what is Woman that you forsake her,_\r\n  _And the hearth-fire and the home-acre,_\r\n  _To go with the old grey Widow-maker?_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTS OF THE JOYOUS VENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was too hot to run about in the open, so Dan asked their friend, old\r\nHobden, to take their own dinghy from the pond and put her on the brook at\r\nthe bottom of the garden. Her painted name was the _Daisy_, but for\r\nexploring expeditions she was the _Golden Hind_ or the _Long Serpent_, or\r\nsome such suitable name. Dan hiked and howked with a boat-hook (the brook\r\nwas too narrow for sculls), and Una punted with a piece of hop-pole. When\r\nthey came to a very shallow place (the _Golden Hind_ drew quite three\r\ninches of water) they disembarked and scuffled her over the gravel by her\r\ntow-rope, and when they reached the overgrown banks beyond the garden they\r\npulled themselves up stream by the low branches.\r\n\r\nThat day they intended to discover the North Cape like ‘Othere, the old\r\nsea-captain,’ in the book of verses which Una had brought with her; but on\r\naccount of the heat they changed it to a voyage up the Amazon and the\r\nsources of the Nile. Even on the shaded water the air was hot and heavy\r\nwith drowsy scents, while outside, through breaks in the trees, the\r\nsunshine burned the pasture like fire. The kingfisher was asleep on his\r\nwatching-branch, and the blackbirds scarcely took the trouble to dive into\r\nthe next bush. Dragon-flies wheeling and clashing were the only things at\r\nwork, except the moor-hens and a big Red Admiral who flapped down out of\r\nthe sunshine for a drink.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached Otter Pool the _Golden Hind_ grounded comfortably on a\r\nshallow, and they lay beneath a roof of close green, watching the water\r\ntrickle over the floodgates down the mossy brick chute from the\r\nmill-stream to the brook. A big trout—the children knew him well—rolled\r\nhead and shoulders at some fly that sailed round the bend, while once in\r\njust so often the brook rose a fraction of an inch against all the wet\r\npebbles, and they watched the slow draw and shiver of a breath of air\r\nthrough the tree-tops. Then the little voices of the slipping water began\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n‘It’s like the shadows talking, isn’t it?’ said Una. She had given up\r\ntrying to read. Dan lay over the bows, trailing his hands in the current.\r\nThey heard feet on the gravel-bar that runs half across the pool and saw\r\nSir Richard Dalyngridge standing over them.\r\n\r\n‘Was yours a dangerous voyage?’ he asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n‘She bumped a lot, sir,’ said Dan. ‘There’s hardly any water this summer.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, the brook was deeper and wider when my children played at Danish\r\npirates. Are you pirate-folk?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, no. We gave up being pirates years ago,’ explained Una. ‘We’re nearly\r\nalways explorers now. Sailing round the world, you know.’\r\n\r\n‘Round?’ said Sir Richard. He sat him in the comfortable crotch of the old\r\nash-root on the bank. ‘How can it be round?’\r\n\r\n‘Wasn’t it in your books?’ Dan suggested. He had been doing geography at\r\nhis last lesson.\r\n\r\n‘I can neither write nor read,’ he replied. ‘Canst _thou_ read, child?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said Dan, ‘barring the very long words.’\r\n\r\n‘Wonderful! Read to me, that I may hear for myself.’\r\n\r\nDan flushed, but opened the book and began—gabbling a little—at ‘The\r\nDiscoverer of the North Cape.’\r\n\r\n  ‘Othere, the old sea captain,\r\n  Who dwelt in Helgoland,\r\n  To Alfred, lover of truth,\r\n  Brought a snow-white walrus tooth,\r\n  That he held in his right hand.’\r\n\r\n‘But—but—this I know! This is an old song! This I have heard sung! This is\r\na miracle,’ Sir Richard interrupted. ‘Nay, do not stop!’ He leaned\r\nforward, and the shadows of the leaves slipped and slid upon his\r\nchain-mail.\r\n\r\n  ‘I ploughed the land with horses,\r\n  But my heart was ill at ease,\r\n  For the old sea-faring men\r\n  Came to me now and then\r\n  With their Sagas of the Seas.’\r\n\r\nHis hand fell on the hilt of the great sword. ‘This is truth,’ he cried,\r\n‘for so did it happen to me,’ and he beat time delightedly to the tramp of\r\nverse after verse.\r\n\r\n  ‘“And now the land,” said Othere,\r\n  “Bent southward suddenly,\r\n  And I followed the curving shore,\r\n  And ever southward bore\r\n  Into a nameless sea.”’\r\n\r\n‘A nameless sea!’ he repeated. ‘So did I—so did Hugh and I.’\r\n\r\n‘Where did you go? Tell us,’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Wait. Let me hear all first.’ So Dan read to the poem’s very end.\r\n\r\n‘Good,’ said the knight. ‘That is Othere’s tale—even as I have heard the\r\nmen in the Dane ships sing it. Not in those same valiant words, but\r\nsomething like to them.’\r\n\r\n‘Have you ever explored North?’ Dan shut the book.\r\n\r\n‘Nay. My venture was South. Farther South than any man has fared, Hugh and\r\nI went down with Witta and his heathen.’ He jerked the tall sword forward,\r\nand leaned on it with both hands; but his eyes looked long past them.\r\n\r\n‘I thought you always lived here,’ said Una, timidly.\r\n\r\n‘Yes; while my Lady Ælueva lived. But she died. She died. Then, my eldest\r\nson being a man, I asked De Aquila’s leave that he should hold the Manor\r\nwhile I went on some journey or pilgrimage—to forget. De Aquila, whom the\r\nSecond William had made Warden of Pevensey in Earl Mortain’s place, was\r\nvery old then, but still he rode his tall, roan horses, and in the saddle\r\nhe looked like a little white falcon. When Hugh, at Dallington over\r\nyonder, heard what I did, he sent for my second son, whom being unmarried\r\nhe had ever looked upon as his own child, and, by De Aquila’s leave, gave\r\nhim the Manor of Dallington to hold till he should return. Then Hugh came\r\nwith me.’\r\n\r\n‘When did this happen?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘That I can answer to the very day, for as we rode with De Aquila by\r\nPevensey—have I said that he was Lord of Pevensey and of the Honour of the\r\nEagle?—to the Bordeaux ship that fetched him his wines yearly out of\r\nFrance, a Marsh man ran to us crying that he had seen a great black goat\r\nwhich bore on his back the body of the King, and that the goat had spoken\r\nto him. On that same day Red William our King, the Conqueror’s son, died\r\nof a secret arrow while he hunted in a forest. “This is a cross matter,”\r\nsaid De Aquila, “to meet on the threshold of a journey. If Red William be\r\ndead I may have to fight for my lands. Wait a little.”\r\n\r\n‘My Lady being dead, I cared nothing for signs and omens, nor Hugh either.\r\nWe took that wine-ship to go to Bordeaux; but the wind failed while we\r\nwere yet in sight of Pevensey; a thick mist hid us, and we drifted with\r\nthe tide along the cliffs to the west. Our company was, for the most part,\r\nmerchants returning to France, and we were laden with wool and there were\r\nthree couple of tall hunting-dogs chained to the rail. Their master was a\r\nknight of Artois. His name I never learned, but his shield bore gold\r\npieces on a red ground, and he limped much as I do, from a wound which he\r\nhad got in his youth at Mantes siege. He served the Duke of Burgundy\r\nagainst the Moors in Spain, and was returning to that war with his dogs.\r\nHe sang us strange Moorish songs that first night, and half persuaded us\r\nto go with him. I was on pilgrimage to forget—which is what no pilgrimage\r\nbrings. I think I would have gone, but....\r\n\r\n‘Look you how the life and fortune of man changes! Towards morning a Dane\r\nship, rowing silently, struck against us in the mist, and while we rolled\r\nhither and yon Hugh, leaning over the rail, fell outboard. I leaped after\r\nhim, and we two tumbled aboard the Dane, and were caught and bound ere we\r\ncould rise. Our own ship was swallowed up in the mist. I judge the Knight\r\nof the Gold Pieces muzzled his dogs with his cloak, lest they should give\r\ntongue and betray the merchants, for I heard their baying suddenly stop.\r\n\r\n‘We lay bound among the benches till morning, when the Danes dragged us to\r\nthe high deck by the steering-place, and their captain—Witta, he was\r\ncalled—turned us over with his foot. Bracelets of gold from elbow to\r\narmpit he wore, and his red hair was long as a woman’s, and came down in\r\nplaited locks on his shoulder. He was stout, with bowed legs and long\r\narms. He spoiled us of all we had, but when he laid hand on Hugh’s sword\r\nand saw the runes on the blade hastily he thrust it back. Yet his\r\ncovetousness overcame him and he tried again and again, and the third time\r\nthe Sword sang loud and angrily, so that the rowers leaned on their oars\r\nto listen. Here they all spoke together, screaming like gulls, and a\r\nYellow Man, such as I have never seen, came to the high deck and cut our\r\nbonds. He was yellow—not from sickness, but by nature. Yellow as honey,\r\nand his eyes stood endwise in his head.’\r\n\r\n‘How do you mean?’ said Una, her chin on her hand.\r\n\r\n‘Thus,’ said Sir Richard. He put a finger to the corner of each eye, and\r\npushed it up till his eyes narrowed to slits.\r\n\r\n‘Why, you look just like a Chinaman!’ cried Dan. ‘Was the man a Chinaman?’\r\n\r\n‘I know not what that may be. Witta had found him half dead among ice on\r\nthe shores of Muscovy. _We_ thought he was a devil. He crawled before us\r\nand brought food in a silver dish which these sea-wolves had robbed from\r\nsome rich abbey, and Witta with his own hands gave us wine. He spoke a\r\nlittle in French, a little in South Saxon, and much in the Northman’s\r\ntongue. We asked him to set us ashore, promising to pay him better ransom\r\nthan he would get price if he sold us to the Moors—as once befell a knight\r\nof my acquaintance sailing from Flushing.\r\n\r\n‘“Not by my father Guthrum’s head,” said he. “The Gods sent ye into my\r\nship for a luck-offering.”\r\n\r\n‘At this I quaked, for I knew it was still the Dane’s custom to sacrifice\r\ncaptives to their gods for fair weather.\r\n\r\n‘“A plague on thy four long bones!” said Hugh. “What profit canst thou\r\nmake of poor old pilgrims that can neither work nor fight?”\r\n\r\n‘“Gods forbid I should fight against thee, poor Pilgrim with the Singing\r\nSword,” said he. “Come with us and be poor no more. Thy teeth are far\r\napart, which is a sure sign thou wilt travel and grow rich.”\r\n\r\n‘“What if we will not come?” said Hugh.\r\n\r\n‘“Swim to England or France,” said Witta. “We are midway between the two.\r\nUnless ye choose to drown yourselves no hair of your head will be harmed\r\nhere aboard. We think ye bring us luck, and I myself know the runes on\r\nthat Sword are good.” He turned and bade them hoist sail.\r\n\r\n‘Hereafter all made way for us as we walked about the ship, and the ship\r\nwas full of wonders.’\r\n\r\n‘What was she like?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Long, low, and narrow, bearing one mast with a red sail, and rowed by\r\nfifteen oars a side,’ the knight answered. ‘At her bows was a deck under\r\nwhich men might lie, and at her stern another shut off by a painted door\r\nfrom the rowers’ benches. Here Hugh and I slept, with Witta and the Yellow\r\nMan, upon tapestries as soft as wool. I remember’—he laughed to\r\nhimself—‘when first we entered there a loud voice cried, “Out swords! Out\r\nswords! Kill, kill!” Seeing us start Witta laughed, and showed us it was\r\nbut a great-beaked grey bird with a red tail. He sat her on his shoulder,\r\nand she called for bread and wine hoarsely, and prayed him to kiss her.\r\nYet she was no more than a silly bird. But—ye knew this?’ He looked at\r\ntheir smiling faces.\r\n\r\n‘We weren’t laughing at you,’ said Una. ‘That must have been a parrot.\r\nIt’s just what Pollies do.’\r\n\r\n‘So we learned later. But here is another marvel. The Yellow Man, whose\r\nname was Kitai, had with him a brown box. In the box was a blue bowl with\r\nred marks upon the rim, and within the bowl, hanging from a fine thread,\r\nwas a piece of iron no thicker than that grass stem, and as long, maybe,\r\nas my spur, but straight. In this iron, said Witta, abode an Evil Spirit\r\nwhich Kitai, the Yellow Man, had brought by Art Magic out of his own\r\ncountry that lay three years’ journey southward. The Evil Spirit strove\r\nday and night to return to his country, and therefore, look you, the iron\r\nneedle pointed continually to the South.’\r\n\r\n‘South?’ said Dan, suddenly, and put his hand into his pocket.\r\n\r\n‘With my own eyes I saw it. Every day and all day long, though the ship\r\nrolled, though the sun and the moon and the stars were hid, this blind\r\nSpirit in the iron knew whither it would go, and strained to the South.\r\nWitta called it the Wise Iron, because it showed him his way across the\r\nunknowable seas.’ Again Sir Richard looked keenly at the children. ‘How\r\nthink ye? Was it sorcery?’\r\n\r\n‘Was it anything like this?’ Dan fished out his old brass pocket-compass,\r\nthat generally lived with his knife and key-ring. ‘The glass has got\r\ncracked, but the needle waggles all right, sir.’\r\n\r\nThe knight drew a long breath of wonder. ‘Yes, yes. The Wise Iron shook\r\nand swung in just this fashion. Now it is still. Now it points to the\r\nSouth.’\r\n\r\n‘North,’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Nay, South! There is the South,’ said Sir Richard. Then they both\r\nlaughed, for naturally when one end of a straight compass-needle points to\r\nthe North, the other must point to the South.\r\n\r\n‘Té,’ said Sir Richard, clicking his tongue. ‘There can be no sorcery if a\r\nchild carries it. Wherefore does it point South—or North?’\r\n\r\n‘Father says that nobody knows,’ said Una.\r\n\r\nSir Richard looked relieved. ‘Then it may still be magic. It was magic to\r\n_us_. And so we voyaged. When the wind served we hoisted sail, and lay all\r\nup along the windward rail, our shields on our backs to break the spray.\r\nWhen it failed, they rowed with long oars; the Yellow Man sat by the Wise\r\nIron, and Witta steered. At first I feared the great white-flowering\r\nwaves, but as I saw how wisely Witta led his ship among them I grew\r\nbolder. Hugh liked it well from the first. My skill is not upon the water;\r\nand rocks, and whirlpools such as we saw by the West Isles of France,\r\nwhere an oar caught on a rock and broke, are much against my stomach. We\r\nsailed South across a stormy sea, where by moonlight, between clouds, we\r\nsaw a Flanders ship roll clean over and sink. Again, though Hugh laboured\r\nwith Witta all night, I lay under the deck with the Talking Bird, and\r\ncared not whether I lived or died. There is a sickness of the sea which,\r\nfor three days, is pure death! When we next saw land Witta said it was\r\nSpain, and we stood out to sea. That coast was full of ships busy in the\r\nDuke’s war against the Moors, and we feared to be hanged by the Duke’s men\r\nor sold into slavery by the Moors. So we put into a small harbour which\r\nWitta knew. At night men came down with loaded mules, and Witta exchanged\r\namber out of the North against little wedges of iron and packets of beads\r\nin earthen pots. The pots he put under the decks, and the wedges of iron\r\nhe laid on the bottom of the ship after he had cast out the stones and\r\nshingle which till then had been our ballast. Wine, too, he bought for\r\nlumps of sweet-smelling grey amber—a little morsel no bigger than a\r\nthumbnail purchased a cask of wine. But I speak like a merchant.’\r\n\r\n‘No, no! Tell us what you had to eat,’ cried Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Meat dried in the sun, and dried fish and ground beans, Witta took in;\r\nand corded frails of a certain sweet, soft fruit, which the Moors use,\r\nwhich is like paste of figs, but with thin, long stones. Aha! Dates is the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n‘“Now,” said Witta, when the ship was loaded, “I counsel you strangers, to\r\npray to your gods, for from here on our road is No Man’s road.” He and his\r\nmen killed a black goat for sacrifice on the bows; and the Yellow Man\r\nbrought out a small, smiling image of dull-green glass and burned incense\r\nbefore it. Hugh and I commended ourselves to God, and Saint Bartholomew,\r\nand Our Lady of the Assumption, who was specially dear to my Lady. We were\r\nnot young, but I think no shame to say, when as we drove out of that\r\nsecret harbour at sunrise over a still sea, we two rejoiced and sang as\r\ndid the knights of old when they followed our great Duke to England. Yet\r\nwas our leader an heathen pirate; all our proud fleet but one galley\r\nperilously overloaded; for guidance we leaned on a pagan sorcerer; and our\r\nport was beyond the world’s end. Witta told us that his father Guthrum had\r\nonce in his life rowed along the shores of Africa to a land where naked\r\nmen sold gold for iron and beads. There had he bought much gold, and no\r\nfew elephants’ teeth, and thither by help of the Wise Iron would Witta go.\r\nWitta feared nothing—except to be poor.\r\n\r\n‘“My father told me,” said Witta, “that a great Shoal runs three days’\r\nsail out from that land, and south of the shoal lies a Forest which grows\r\nin the sea. South and east of the Forest my father came to a place where\r\nthe men hid gold in their hair; but all that country, he said, was full of\r\nDevils who lived in trees, and tore folk limb from limb. How think ye?”\r\n\r\n‘“Gold or no gold,” said Hugh, fingering his sword, “it is a joyous\r\nventure. Have at these devils of thine, Witta!”\r\n\r\n‘“Venture!” said Witta, sourly. “I am only a poor sea-thief. I do not set\r\nmy life adrift on a plank for joy, or the venture. Once I beach ship again\r\nat Stavanger, and feel the wife’s arms round my neck, I’ll seek no more\r\nventures. A ship is heavier care than a wife or cattle.”\r\n\r\n‘He leaped down among the rowers, chiding them for their little strength\r\nand their great stomachs. Yet Witta was a wolf in fight, and a very fox in\r\ncunning.\r\n\r\n‘We were driven South by a storm, and for three days and three nights he\r\ntook the stern-oar and threddled the longship through the sea. When it\r\nrose beyond measure he brake a pot of whale’s oil upon the water, which\r\nwonderfully smoothed it, and in that anointed patch he turned her head to\r\nthe wind and threw out oars at the end of a rope, to make, he said, an\r\nanchor at which we lay rolling sorely, but dry. This craft his father\r\nGuthrum had shown him. He knew, too, all the Leech-Book of Bald, who was a\r\nwise doctor, and he knew the Ship-Book of Hlaf the Woman, who robbed\r\nEgypt. He knew all the care of a ship.\r\n\r\n‘After the storm we saw a mountain whose top was covered with snow and\r\npierced the clouds. The grasses under this mountain, boiled and eaten, are\r\na good cure for soreness of the gums and swelled ankles. We lay there\r\neight days, till men in skins threw stones at us. When the heat increased\r\nWitta spread a cloth on bent sticks above the rowers, for the wind failed\r\nbetween the Island of the Mountain and the shore of Africa, which is east\r\nof it. That shore is sandy, and we rowed along it within three bowshots.\r\nHere we saw whales, and fish in the shape of shields, but longer than our\r\nship. Some slept, some opened their mouths at us, and some danced on the\r\nhot waters. The water was hot to the hand, and the sky was hidden by hot,\r\ngrey mists, out of which blew a fine dust that whitened our hair and\r\nbeards of a morning. Here, too, were fish that flew in the air like birds.\r\nThey would fall on the laps of the rowers, and when we went ashore we\r\nwould roast and eat them.’\r\n\r\nThe knight paused to see if the children doubted him, but they only nodded\r\nand said, ‘Go on.’\r\n\r\n‘The yellow land lay on our left, the grey sea on our right. Knight though\r\nI was, I pulled my oar amongst the rowers. I caught seaweed and dried it,\r\nand stuffed it between the pots of beads lest they should break.\r\nKnighthood is for the land. At sea, look you, a man is but a spurless\r\nrider on a bridleless horse. I learned to make strong knots in ropes—yes,\r\nand to join two ropes end to end, so that even Witta could scarcely see\r\nwhere they had been married. But Hugh had tenfold more sea-cunning than I.\r\nWitta gave him charge of the rowers of the left side. Thorkild of Borkum,\r\na man with a broken nose, that wore a Norman steel cap, had the rowers of\r\nthe right, and each side rowed and sang against the other. They saw that\r\nno man was idle. Truly, as Hugh said, and Witta would laugh at him, a ship\r\nis all more care than a Manor.\r\n\r\n‘How? Thus. There was water to fetch from the shore when we could find it,\r\nas well as wild fruit and grasses, and sand for scrubbing of the decks and\r\nbenches to keep them sweet. Also we hauled the ship out on low islands and\r\nemptied all her gear, even to the iron wedges, and burned off the weed,\r\nthat had grown on her, with torches of rush, and smoked below the decks\r\nwith rushes dampened in salt water, as Hlaf the Woman orders in her\r\nShip-Book. Once when we were thus stripped, and the ship lay propped on\r\nher keel, the bird cried, “Out swords!” as though she saw an enemy. Witta\r\nvowed he would wring her neck.’\r\n\r\n‘Poor Polly! Did he?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Nay. She was the ship’s bird. She could call all the rowers by name....\r\nThose were good days—for a wifeless man—with Witta and his heathen—beyond\r\nthe world’s end.... After many weeks we came on the Great Shoal which\r\nstretched, as Witta’s father had said, far out to sea. We skirted it till\r\nwe were giddy with the sight and dizzy with the sound of bars and\r\nbreakers; and when we reached land again we found a naked black people\r\ndwelling among woods, who for one wedge of iron loaded us with fruits and\r\ngrasses and eggs. Witta scratched his head at them in sign he would buy\r\ngold. They had no gold, but they understood the sign (all the gold-traders\r\nhide their gold in their thick hair), for they pointed along the coast.\r\nThey beat, too, on their chests with their clenched hands, and that, if we\r\nhad known it, was an evil sign.’\r\n\r\n‘What did it mean?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Patience. Ye shall hear. We followed the coast eastward sixteen days\r\n(counting time by sword-cuts on the helm-rail) till we came to the Forest\r\nin the Sea. Trees grew out of mud, arched upon lean and high roots, and\r\nmany muddy water-ways ran allwhither into darkness under the trees. Here\r\nwe lost the sun. We followed the winding channels between the trees, and\r\nwhere we could not row we laid hold of the crusted roots and hauled\r\nourselves along. The water was foul, and great glittering flies tormented\r\nus. Morning and evening a blue mist covered the mud, which bred fevers.\r\nFour of our rowers sickened, and were bound to their benches, lest they\r\nshould leap overboard and be eaten by the monsters of the mud. The Yellow\r\nMan lay sick beside the Wise Iron, rolling his head and talking in his own\r\ntongue. Only the Bird throve. She sat on Witta’s shoulder and screamed in\r\nthat noisome, silent darkness. Yes; I think it was the silence we feared.’\r\n\r\nHe paused to listen to the comfortable home noises of the brook.\r\n\r\n‘When we had lost count of time among those black gullies and swashes, we\r\nheard, as it were, a drum beat far off, and following it we broke into a\r\nbroad, brown river by a hut in a clearing among fields of pumkins. We\r\nthanked God to see the sun again. The people of the village gave the good\r\nwelcome, and Witta scratched his head at them (for gold), and showed them\r\nour iron and beads. They ran to the bank—we were still in the ship—and\r\npointed to our swords and bows, for always when near shore we lay armed.\r\nSoon they fetched store of gold in bars and in dust from their huts, and\r\nsome great blackened elephant teeth. These they piled on the bank, as\r\nthough to tempt us, and made signs of dealing blows in battle, and pointed\r\nup to the tree tops, and to the forest behind. Their captain or chief\r\nsorcerer then beat on his chest with his fists, and gnashed his teeth.\r\n\r\n‘Said Thorkild of Borkum: “Do they mean we must fight for all this gear?”\r\nand he half drew his sword.\r\n\r\n‘“Nay,” said Hugh. “I think they ask us to league against some enemy.”\r\n\r\n‘“I like this not,” said Witta, of a sudden. “Back into midstream.”\r\n\r\n‘So we did, and sat still all, watching the black folk and the gold they\r\npiled on the bank. Again we heard drums beat in the forest, and the people\r\nfled to their huts, leaving the gold unguarded.\r\n\r\n‘Then Hugh, at the bows, pointed without speech, and we saw a great Devil\r\ncome out of the forest. He shaded his brows with his hand, and moistened\r\nhis pink tongue between his lips—thus.’\r\n\r\n‘A Devil!’ said Dan, delightfully horrified.\r\n\r\n‘Yea. Taller than a man; covered with reddish hair. When he had well\r\nregarded our ship, he beat on his chest with his fists till it sounded\r\nlike rolling drums, and came to the bank swinging all his body between his\r\nlong arms, and gnashed his teeth at us. Hugh loosed arrow, and pierced him\r\nthrough the throat. He fell roaring, and three other Devils ran out of the\r\nforest and hauled him into a tall tree out of sight. Anon they cast down\r\nthe blood-stained arrow, and lamented together among the leaves. Witta saw\r\nthe gold on the bank; he was loath to leave it. “Sirs,” said he (no man\r\nhad spoken till then), “yonder is that we have come so far and so\r\npainfully to find, laid out to our very hand. Let us row in while these\r\nDevils bewail themselves, and at least bear off what we may.”\r\n\r\n‘Bold as a wolf, cunning as a fox was Witta! He set four archers on the\r\nforedeck to shoot the Devils if they should leap from the tree, which was\r\nclose to the bank. He manned ten oars a side, and bade them watch his hand\r\nto row in or back out, and so coaxed he them toward the bank. But none\r\nwould set foot ashore, though the gold was within ten paces. No man is\r\nhasty to his hanging. They whimpered at their oars like beaten hounds, and\r\nWitta bit his fingers for rage.\r\n\r\n‘Said Hugh of a sudden, “Hark!” At first we thought it was the buzzing of\r\nthe glittering flies on the water, but it grew loud and fierce, so that\r\nall men heard.’\r\n\r\n‘What?’ said Dan and Una.\r\n\r\n‘It was the sword.’ Sir Richard patted the smooth hilt. ‘It sang as a Dane\r\nsings before battle. “I go,” said Hugh, and he leaped from the bows and\r\nfell among the gold. I was afraid to my four bones’ marrow, but for\r\nshame’s sake I followed, and Thorkild of Borkum leaped after me. None\r\nother came. “Blame me not,” cried Witta behind us, “I must abide by my\r\nship.” We three had no time to blame or praise. We stooped to the gold and\r\nthrew it back over our shoulders, one hand on our swords and one eye on\r\nthe tree, which nigh overhung us.\r\n\r\n‘I know not how the Devils leaped down, or how the fight began. I heard\r\nHugh cry: “Out! out!” as though he were at Santlache again; I saw\r\nThorkild’s steel cap smitten off his head by a great hairy hand, and I\r\nfelt an arrow from the ship whistle past my ear. They say that till Witta\r\ntook his sword to the rowers he could not bring his ship in shore; and\r\neach one of the four archers said afterwards that he alone had pierced the\r\nDevil that fought me. I do not know. I went to it in my mail-shirt, which\r\nsaved my skin. With long-sword and belt-dagger I fought for the life\r\nagainst a Devil whose very feet were hands, and who whirled me back and\r\nforth like a dead branch. He had me by the waist, my arms to my side, when\r\nan arrow from the ship pierced him between the shoulders, and he loosened\r\ngrip. I passed my sword twice through him, and he crutched himself away\r\nbetween his long arms, coughing and moaning. Next, as I remember, I saw\r\nThorkild of Borkum bareheaded and smiling, leaping up and down before a\r\nDevil that leaped and gnashed his teeth. Then Hugh passed, his sword\r\nshifted to his left hand, and I wondered why I had not known that Hugh was\r\na left-handed man; and thereafter I remembered nothing till I felt spray\r\non my face, and we were in sunshine on the open sea. That was twenty days\r\nafter.’\r\n\r\n‘What had happened? Did Hugh die?’ the children asked.\r\n\r\n‘Never was such a fight fought by christened man,’ said Sir Richard. ‘An\r\narrow from the ship had saved me from my Devil, and Thorkild of Borkum had\r\ngiven back before his Devil, till the bowmen on the ship could shoot it\r\nall full of arrows from near by; but Hugh’s Devil was cunning, and had\r\nkept behind trees, where no arrow could reach. Body to body there, by\r\nstark strength of sword and hand, had Hugh slain him, and, dying, the\r\nThing had clenched his teeth on the sword. Judge what teeth they were!’\r\n\r\nSir Richard turned the sword again that the children might see the two\r\ngreat chiselled gouges on either side of the blade.\r\n\r\n‘Those same teeth met in Hugh’s right arm and side,’ Sir Richard went on.\r\n‘I? Oh, I had no more than a broken foot and a fever. Thorkild’s ear was\r\nbitten, but Hugh’s arm and side clean withered away. I saw him where he\r\nlay along, sucking a fruit in his left hand. His flesh was wasted off his\r\nbones, his hair was patched with white, and his hand was blue-veined like\r\na woman’s. He put his left hand round my neck and whispered, “Take my\r\nsword. It has been thine since Hastings, O, my brother, but I can never\r\nhold hilt again.” We lay there on the high deck talking of Santlache and,\r\nI think, of every day since Santlache, and it came so that we both wept. I\r\nwas weak, and he little more than a shadow.\r\n\r\n‘“Nay—nay,” said Witta, at the helm-rail. “Gold is a good right arm to any\r\nman. Look—look at the gold!” He bade Thorkild show us the gold and the\r\nelephants’ teeth, as though we had been children. He had brought away all\r\nthe gold on the bank, and twice as much more, that the people of the\r\nvillage gave him for slaying the Devils. They worshipped us as gods,\r\nThorkild told me: it was one of their old women healed up Hugh’s poor\r\narm.’\r\n\r\n‘How much gold did you get?’ asked Dan.\r\n\r\n‘How can I say? Where we came out with wedges of iron under the rowers’\r\nfeet we returned with wedges of gold hidden beneath planks. There was dust\r\nof gold in packages where we slept; and along the side and crosswise under\r\nthe benches we lashed the blackened elephants’ teeth.\r\n\r\n‘“I had sooner have my right arm,” said Hugh, when he had seen all.\r\n\r\n‘“Ahai! That was my fault,” said Witta. “I should have taken ransom and\r\nlanded you in France when first you came aboard, ten months ago.”\r\n\r\n‘“It is over-late now,” said Hugh, laughing.\r\n\r\n‘Witta plucked at his long shoulder-lock. “But think!” said he. “If I had\r\nlet ye go—which I swear I would never have done, for I love ye more than\r\nbrothers—if I had let ye go, by now ye might have been horribly slain by\r\nsome mere Moor in the Duke of Burgundy’s war, or ye might have been\r\nmurdered by land-thieves, or ye might have died of the plague at an inn.\r\nThink of this and do not blame me overmuch, Hugh. See! I will only take a\r\nhalf of the gold.”\r\n\r\n‘“I blame thee not at all, Witta,” said Hugh. “It was a joyous venture,\r\nand we thirty-five here have done what never men have done. If I live till\r\nEngland, I will build me a stout keep over Dallington out of my share.”\r\n\r\n‘“I will buy cattle and amber and warm red cloth for the wife,” said\r\nWitta, “and I will hold all the land at the head of Stavanger Fiord. Many\r\nwill fight for me now. But first we must turn North, and with this honest\r\ntreasure aboard I pray we meet no pirate ships.”\r\n\r\n‘We did not laugh. We were careful. We were afraid lest we should lose one\r\ngrain of our gold for which we had fought Devils.\r\n\r\n‘“Where is the Sorcerer?” said I, for Witta was looking at the Wise Iron\r\nin the box, and I could not see the Yellow Man.\r\n\r\n‘“He has gone to his own country,” said he. “He rose up in the night while\r\nwe were beating out of that forest in the mud, and said that he could see\r\nit behind the trees. He leaped out on to the mud, and did not answer when\r\nwe called; so we called no more. He left the Wise Iron, which is all that\r\nI care for—and see, the Spirit still points to the South!”\r\n\r\n‘We were troubled for fear that the Wise Iron should fail us now that its\r\nYellow Man had gone, and when we saw the Spirit still served us we grew\r\nafraid of too strong winds, and of shoals, and of careless leaping fish,\r\nand of all the people on all the shores where we landed.’\r\n\r\n‘Why?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Because of the gold—because of our gold. Gold changes men altogether.\r\nThorkild of Borkum did not change. He laughed at Witta for his fears, and\r\nat us for our counselling Witta to furl sail when the ship pitched at all.\r\n\r\n‘“Better be drowned out of hand,” said Thorkild of Borkum, “than go tied\r\nto a deck-load of yellow dust.”\r\n\r\n‘He was a landless man, and had been slave to some King in the East. He\r\nwould have beaten out the gold into deep bands to put round the oars, and\r\nround the prow.\r\n\r\n‘Yet, though he vexed himself for the gold, Witta waited upon Hugh like a\r\nwoman, lending him his shoulder when the ship rolled, and tying of ropes\r\nfrom side to side that Hugh might hold by them. But for Hugh, he said—and\r\nso did all his men—they would never have won the gold. I remember Witta\r\nmade a little, thin gold ring for our Bird to swing in. Three months we\r\nrowed and sailed and went ashore for fruits or to clean the ship. When we\r\nsaw wild horsemen, riding among sand-dunes, flourishing spears we knew we\r\nwere on the Moors’ coast, and stood over north to Spain; and a strong\r\nsouth-west wind bore us in ten days to a coast of high red rocks, where we\r\nheard a hunting-horn blow among the yellow gorse and knew it was England.\r\n\r\n‘“Now find ye Pevensey yourselves,” said Witta. “I love not these narrow\r\nship-filled seas.”\r\n\r\n‘He set the dried, salted head of the Devil, which Hugh had killed, high\r\non our prow, and all boats fled from us. Yet, for our gold’s sake, we were\r\nmore afraid than they. We crept along the coast by night till we came to\r\nthe chalk cliffs, and so east to Pevensey. Witta would not come ashore\r\nwith us, though Hugh promised him wine at Dallington enough to swim in. He\r\nwas on fire to see his wife, and ran into the Marsh after sunset, and\r\nthere he left us and our share of gold, and backed out on the same tide.\r\nHe made no promise; he swore no oath; he looked for no thanks; but to\r\nHugh, an armless man, and to me, an old cripple whom he could have flung\r\ninto the sea, he passed over wedge upon wedge, packet upon packet of gold\r\nand dust of gold, and only ceased when we would take no more. As he\r\nstooped from the rail to bid us farewell he stripped off his right-arm\r\nbracelets and put them all on Hugh’s left, and he kissed Hugh on the\r\ncheek. I think when Thorkild of Borkum bade the rowers give way we were\r\nnear weeping. It is true that Witta was an heathen and a pirate; true it\r\nis he held us by force many months in his ship, but I loved that\r\nbow-legged, blue-eyed man for his great boldness, his cunning, his skill,\r\nand, beyond all, for his simplicity.’\r\n\r\n‘Did he get home all right?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘I never knew. We saw him hoist sail under the moon-track and stand away.\r\nI have prayed that he found his wife and the children.’\r\n\r\n‘And what did you do?’\r\n\r\n‘We waited on the Marsh till the day. Then I sat by the gold, all tied in\r\nan old sail, while Hugh went to Pevensey, and De Aquila sent us horses.’\r\n\r\nSir Richard crossed hands on his sword-hilt, and stared down stream\r\nthrough the soft warm shadows.\r\n\r\n‘A whole shipload of gold!’ said Una, looking at the little _Golden Hind_.\r\n‘But I’m glad I didn’t see the Devils.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t believe they were Devils,’ Dan whispered back.\r\n\r\n‘Eh?’ said Sir Richard. ‘Witta’s father warned him they were\r\nunquestionable Devils. One must believe one’s father, and not one’s\r\nchildren. What were my Devils, then?’\r\n\r\nDan flushed all over. ‘I—I only thought,’ he stammered; ‘I’ve got a book\r\ncalled _The Gorilla Hunters_—it’s a continuation of _Coral Island_,\r\nsir—and it says there that the gorillas (they’re big monkeys, you know)\r\nwere always chewing iron up.’\r\n\r\n‘Not always,’ said Una. ‘Only twice.’ They had been reading _The Gorilla\r\nHunters_ in the orchard.\r\n\r\n‘Well, anyhow, they always drummed on their chests, like Sir Richard’s\r\ndid, before they went for people. And they built houses in trees, too.’\r\n\r\n‘Ha!’ Sir Richard opened his eyes. ‘Houses like flat nests did our Devils\r\nmake, where their imps lay and looked at us. I did not see them (I was\r\nsick after the fight), but Witta told me and, lo, ye know it also?\r\nWonderful! Were our Devils only nest-building apes? Is there no sorcery\r\nleft in the world?’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t know,’ answered Dan, uncomfortably. ‘I’ve seen a man take rabbits\r\nout of a hat, and he told us we could see how he did it, if we watched\r\nhard. And we did.’\r\n\r\n‘But we didn’t,’ said Una sighing. ‘Oh! there’s Puck!’\r\n\r\nThe little fellow, brown and smiling, peered between two stems of an ash,\r\nnodded, and slid down the bank into the cool beside them.\r\n\r\n‘No sorcery, Sir Richard?’ he laughed, and blew on a full dandelion head\r\nhe had picked.\r\n\r\n‘They tell me that Witta’s Wise Iron was a toy. The boy carries such an\r\nIron with him. They tell me our Devils were apes, called gorillas!’ said\r\nSir Richard, indignantly.\r\n\r\n‘That is the sorcery of books,’ said Puck. ‘I warned thee they were wise\r\nchildren. All people can be wise by reading of books.’\r\n\r\n‘But are the books true?’ Sir Richard frowned. ‘I like not all this\r\nreading and writing.’\r\n\r\n‘Ye-es,’ said Puck, holding the naked dandelion head at arm’s length. ‘But\r\nif we hang all fellows who write falsely, why did De Aquila not begin with\r\nGilbert, the Clerk? _He_ was false enough.’\r\n\r\n‘Poor false Gilbert. Yet in his fashion, he was bold,’ said Sir Richard.\r\n\r\n‘What did he do?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘He wrote,’ said Sir Richard. ‘Is the tale meet for children, think you?’\r\nHe looked at Puck; but, ‘Tell us! Tell us!’ cried Dan and Una together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHORKILD’S SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n  _There is no wind along these seas,_\r\n    Out oars for Stavanger!\r\n    Forward all for Stavanger!\r\n  _So we must wake the white-ash breeze,_\r\n    Let fall for Stavanger!\r\n    A long pull for Stavanger!\r\n\r\n  _Oh, hear the benches creak and strain!_\r\n    (A long pull for Stavanger!)\r\n  _She thinks she smells the Northland rain!_\r\n    (A long pull for Stavanger!)\r\n\r\n  _She thinks she smells the Northland snow,_\r\n  _And she’s as glad as we to go!_\r\n\r\n  _She thinks she smells the Northland rime,_\r\n  _And the dear dark nights of winter-time._\r\n\r\n  _Her very bolts are sick for shore,_\r\n  _And we—we want it ten times more!_\r\n\r\n  _Hoe—all you Gods that love brave men,_\r\n  _Send us a three-reef gale again!_\r\n\r\n  _Send us a gale, and watch us come,_\r\n  _With close-cropped canvas slashing home!_\r\n\r\n  But—_there’s no wind in all these seas,_\r\n    A long pull for Stavanger!\r\n  _So we must wake the white-ash breeze,_\r\n    A long pull for Stavanger!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD MEN AT PEVENSEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD MEN AT PEVENSEY\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It has nought to do with apes or devils,’ Sir Richard went on, in an\r\nundertone. ‘It concerns De Aquila, than whom there was never bolder nor\r\ncraftier, nor more hardy knight born. And, remember, he was an old, old\r\nman at that time.’\r\n\r\n‘When?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘When we came back from sailing with Witta.’\r\n\r\n‘What did you do with your gold?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Have patience. Link by link is chain-mail made. I will tell all in its\r\nplace. We bore the gold to Pevensey on horseback—three loads of it—and\r\nthen up to the north chamber, above the Great Hall of Pevensey Castle,\r\nwhere De Aquila lay in winter. He sat on his bed like a little white\r\nfalcon, turning his head swiftly from one to the other as we told our\r\ntale. Jehan the Crab, an old sour man-at-arms, guarded the stairway, but\r\nDe Aquila bade him wait at the stair-foot, and let down both leather\r\ncurtains over the door. It was Jehan whom De Aquila had sent to us with\r\nthe horses, and only Jehan had loaded the gold. When our story was told,\r\nDe Aquila gave us the news of England, for we were as men waked from a\r\nyear-long sleep. The Red King was dead—slain (ye remember?) the day we set\r\nsail—and Henry, his younger brother, had made himself King of England over\r\nthe head of Robert of Normandy. This was the very thing that the Red King\r\nhad done to Robert when our Great William died. Then Robert of Normandy,\r\nmad, as De Aquila said, at twice missing of this kingdom, had sent an army\r\nagainst England, which army had been well beaten back to their ships at\r\nPortsmouth. A little earlier, and Witta’s ship would have rowed through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n‘“And now,” said De Aquila, “half the great Barons of the north and west\r\nare out against the King between Salisbury and Shrewsbury; and half the\r\nother half wait to see which way the game shall go. They say Henry is\r\noverly English for their stomachs, because he hath married an English wife\r\nand she hath coaxed him to give back their old laws to our Saxons. (Better\r\nride a horse on the bit he knows, _I_ say.) But that is only a cloak to\r\ntheir falsehood.” He cracked his finger on the table where the wine was\r\nspilt, and thus he spoke:—\r\n\r\n‘“William crammed us Norman barons full of good English acres after\r\nSantlache. _I_ had my share too,” he said, and clapped Hugh on the\r\nshoulder; “but I warned him—I warned him before Odo rebelled—that he\r\nshould have bidden the Barons give up their lands and lordships in\r\nNormandy if they would be English lords. Now they are all but princes both\r\nin England and Normandy—trencher-fed hounds, with a foot in one trough and\r\nboth eyes on the other! Robert of Normandy has sent them word that if they\r\ndo not fight for him in England he will sack and harry out their lands in\r\nNormandy. Therefore Clare has risen, Fitz Osborn has risen, Montgomery has\r\nrisen—whom our First William made an English earl. Even D’Arcy is out with\r\nhis men, whose father I remember a little hedge-sparrow knight nearby\r\nCaen. If Henry wins, the Barons can still flee to Normandy, where Robert\r\nwill welcome them. If Henry loses, Robert, he says, will give them more\r\nlands in England. Oh, a pest—a pest on Normandy, for she will be our\r\nEngland’s curse this many a long year!”\r\n\r\n‘“Amen,” said Hugh. “But will the war come our ways, think you?”\r\n\r\n‘“Not from the North,” said De Aquila. “But the sea is always open. If the\r\nBarons gain the upper hand Robert will send another army into England for\r\nsure; and this time I think he will land here—where his father, the\r\nConqueror, landed. Ye have brought your pigs to a pretty market! Half\r\nEngland alight, and gold enough on the ground”—he stamped on the bars\r\nbeneath the table—“to set every sword in Christendom fighting.”\r\n\r\n‘“What is to do?” said Hugh. “I have no keep at Dallington; and if we\r\nburied it, whom could we trust?”\r\n\r\n‘“Me,” said De Aquila. “Pevensey walls are strong. No man but Jehan, who\r\nis my dog, knows what is between them.” He drew a curtain by the\r\nshot-window and showed us the shaft of a well in the thickness of the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n‘“I made it for a drinking-well,” he said, “but we found salt water, and\r\nit rises and falls with the tide. Hark!” We heard the water whistle and\r\nblow at the bottom. “Will it serve?” said he.\r\n\r\n‘“Needs must,” said Hugh. “Our lives are in thy hands.” So we lowered all\r\nthe gold down except one small chest of it by De Aquila’s bed, which we\r\nkept as much for his delight in its weight and colour as for any our\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n‘In the morning, ere we rode to our Manors, he said: “I do not say\r\nfarewell; because ye will return and bide here. Not for love nor for\r\nsorrow, but to be with the gold. Have a care,” he said, laughing, “lest I\r\nuse it to make myself Pope. Trust me not, but return!”’\r\n\r\nSir Richard paused and smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n‘In seven days, then, we returned from our Manors—from the Manors which\r\nhad been ours.’\r\n\r\n‘And were the children quite well?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘My sons were young. Land and governance belong by right to young men.’\r\nSir Richard was talking to himself. ‘It would have broken their hearts if\r\nwe had taken back our Manors. They made us great welcome, but we could\r\nsee—Hugh and I could see—that our day was done. I was a cripple and he a\r\none-armed man. No!’ He shook his head. ‘And therefore’—he raised his\r\nvoice—‘we rode back to Pevensey.’\r\n\r\n‘I’m sorry,’ said Una, for the knight seemed very sorrowful.\r\n\r\n‘Little maid, it all passed long ago. They were young; we were old. We let\r\nthem rule the Manors. “Aha!” cried De Aquila from his shot-window, when we\r\ndismounted. “Back again to earth, old foxes?” but when we were in his\r\nchamber above the hall he puts his arms about us and says, “Welcome,\r\nghosts! Welcome, poor ghosts!”... Thus it fell out that we were rich\r\nbeyond belief, and lonely. And lonely!’\r\n\r\n‘What did you do?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘We watched for Robert of Normandy,’ said the knight. ‘De Aquila was like\r\nWitta. He suffered no idleness. In fair weather we would ride along\r\nbetween Bexlei on the one side, to Cuckmere on the other—sometimes with\r\nhawk, sometimes with hound (there are stout hares both on the Marsh and\r\nthe Downland), but always with an eye to the sea, for fear of fleets from\r\nNormandy. In foul weather he would walk on the top of his tower, frowning\r\nagainst the rain—peering here and pointing there. It always vexed him to\r\nthink how Witta’s ship had come and gone without his knowledge. When the\r\nwind ceased and ships anchored, to the wharf’s edge he would go and,\r\nleaning on his sword among the stinking fish, would call to the mariners\r\nfor their news from France. His other eye he kept landward for word of\r\nHenry’s war against the Barons.\r\n\r\n‘Many brought him news—jongleurs, harpers, pedlars, sutlers, priests, and\r\nthe like; and, though he was secret enough in small things, yet, if their\r\nnews misliked him, then, regarding neither time nor place nor people,\r\nwould he curse our King Henry for a fool or a babe. I have heard him cry\r\naloud by the fishing-boats: “If I were King of England I would do thus and\r\nthus”; and when I rode out to see that the warning-beacons were laid and\r\ndry, he hath often called to me from the shot-window: “Look to it,\r\nRichard! Do not copy our blind King, but see with thine own eyes and feel\r\nwith thine own hands.” I do not think he knew any sort of fear. And so we\r\nlived at Pevensey, in the little chamber above the Hall.\r\n\r\n‘One foul night came word that a messenger of the King waited below. We\r\nwere chilled after a long riding in the fog towards Bexlei, which is an\r\neasy place for ships to land. De Aquila sent word the man might either eat\r\nwith us or wait till we had fed. Anon Jehan, at the stair-head, cried that\r\nhe had called for horse, and was gone. “Pest on him!” said De Aquila. “I\r\nhave more to do than to shiver in the Great Hall for every gadling the\r\nKing sends. Left he no word?”\r\n\r\n‘“None,” said Jehan, “except”—he had been with De Aquila at\r\nSantlache—“except he said that if an old dog could not learn new tricks it\r\nwas time to sweep out the kennel.”\r\n\r\n‘“Oho!” said De Aquila, rubbing his nose, “to whom did he say that?”\r\n\r\n‘“To his beard, chiefly, but some to his horse’s flank as he was girthing\r\nup. I followed him out,” said Jehan the Crab.\r\n\r\n‘“What was his shield-mark?”\r\n\r\n‘“Gold horseshoes on black,” said the Crab.\r\n\r\n‘“That is one of Fulke’s men,” said De Aquila.’\r\n\r\nPuck broke in very gently, ‘Gold horseshoes on black is _not_ the Fulkes’\r\nshield. The Fulkes’ arms are——’\r\n\r\nThe knight waved one hand statelily.\r\n\r\n‘Thou knowest that evil man’s true name,’ he replied, ‘but I have chosen\r\nto call him Fulke because I promised him I would not tell the story of his\r\nwickedness so that any man might guess it. I have changed _all_ the names\r\nin my tale. His children’s children may be still alive.’\r\n\r\n‘True—true,’ said Puck, smiling softly. ‘It is knightly to keep faith—even\r\nafter a thousand years.’\r\n\r\nSir Richard bowed a little and went on:—\r\n\r\n‘“Gold horseshoes on black?” said De Aquila. “I had heard Fulke had joined\r\nthe Barons, but if this is true our King must be of the upper hand. No\r\nmatter, all Fulkes are faithful. Still, I would not have sent the man away\r\nempty.”\r\n\r\n‘“He fed,” said Jehan. “Gilbert the Clerk fetched him meat and wine from\r\nthe kitchens. He ate at Gilbert’s table.”\r\n\r\n‘This Gilbert was a clerk from Battle Abbey, who kept the accounts of the\r\nManor of Pevensey. He was tall and pale-coloured, and carried those\r\nnew-fashioned beads for counting of prayers. They were large brown nuts or\r\nseeds, and hanging from his girdle with his penner and inkhorn they\r\nclashed when he walked. His place was in the great fireplace. There was\r\nhis table of accounts, and there he lay o’ nights. He feared the hounds in\r\nthe Hall that came nosing after bones or to sleep on the warm ashes, and\r\nwould slash at them with his beads—like a woman. When De Aquila sat in\r\nHall to do justice, take fines, or grant lands, Gilbert would so write it\r\nin the Manor-roll. But it was none of his work to feed our guests, or to\r\nlet them depart without his lord’s knowledge.\r\n\r\n‘Said De Aquila, after Jehan was gone down the stair: “Hugh, hast thou\r\never told my Gilbert thou canst read Latin hand-of-write?”\r\n\r\n‘“No,” said Hugh. “He is no friend to me, or to Odo my hound either.” “No\r\nmatter,” said De Aquila. “Let him never know thou canst tell one letter\r\nfrom its fellow, and”—here he jerked us in the ribs with his\r\nscabbard—“watch him both of ye. There be devils in Africa, as I have\r\nheard, but by the Saints there be greater devils in Pevensey!” And that\r\nwas all he would say.\r\n\r\n‘It chanced, some small while afterwards, a Norman man-at-arms would wed a\r\nSaxon wench of the Manor, and Gilbert (we had watched him well since De\r\nAquila spoke) doubted whether her folk were free or slave. Since De Aquila\r\nwould give them a field of good land, if she were free, the matter came up\r\nat the justice in Great Hall before De Aquila. First the wench’s father\r\nspoke; then her mother; then all together, till the hall rang and the\r\nhounds bayed. De Aquila held up his hands. “Write her free,” he called to\r\nGilbert by the fireplace. “A’ God’s Name write her free, before she\r\ndeafens me! Yes, yes,” he said to the wench that was on her knees at him;\r\n“thou art Cerdic’s sister, and own cousin to the Lady of Mercia, if thou\r\nwilt be silent. In fifty years there will be neither Norman nor Saxon, but\r\nall English,” said he, “and _these_ are the men that do our work!” He\r\nclapped the man-at-arms, that was Jehan’s nephew, on the shoulder, and\r\nkissed the wench, and fretted with his feet among the rushes to show it\r\nwas finished. (The Great Hall is always bitter cold.) I stood at his side;\r\nHugh was behind Gilbert in the fireplace making to play with wise rough\r\nOdo. He signed to De Aquila, who bade Gilbert measure the new field for\r\nthe new couple. Out then runs our Gilbert between man and maid, his beads\r\nclashing at his waist, and the Hall being empty, we three sit by the fire.\r\n\r\n‘Said Hugh, leaning down to the hearthstones, “I saw this stone move under\r\nGilbert’s foot when Odo snuffed at it. Look!” De Aquila digged in the\r\nashes with his sword; the stone tilted; beneath it lay a parchment folden,\r\nand the writing atop was: “Words spoken against the King by our Lord of\r\nPevensey—the second part.”\r\n\r\n‘Here was set out (Hugh read it us whispering) every jest De Aquila had\r\nmade to us touching the King; every time he had called out to me from the\r\nshot-window, and every time he had said what he would do if he were King\r\nof England. Yes, day by day had his daily speech, which he never stinted,\r\nbeen set down by Gilbert, tricked out and twisted from its true meaning,\r\nyet withal so cunningly that none could deny who knew him that De Aquila\r\nhad in some sort spoken those words. Ye see?’\r\n\r\nDan and Una nodded.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said Una, gravely. ‘It isn’t what you say so much. It’s what you\r\nmean when you say it. Like calling Dan a beast in fun. Only grown-ups\r\ndon’t always understand.’\r\n\r\n‘“He hath done this day by day before our very face?” said De Aquila.\r\n\r\n“Nay, hour by hour,” said Hugh. “When De Aquila spoke even now, in the\r\nhall, of Saxons and Normans, I saw Gilbert write on a parchment, which he\r\nkept beside the Manor-roll, that De Aquila said soon there would be no\r\nNormans left in England if his men-at-arms did their work aright.”\r\n\r\n‘“Bones of the Saints!” said De Aquila. “What avail is honour or a sword\r\nagainst a pen? Where did Gilbert hide that writing? He shall eat it.”\r\n\r\n‘“In his breast when he ran out,” said Hugh. “Which made me look to see\r\nwhere he kept his finished stuff. When Odo scratched at this stone here, I\r\nsaw his face change. So I was sure.”\r\n\r\n‘“He is bold,” said De Aquila. “Do him justice. In his own fashion, my\r\nGilbert is bold.”\r\n\r\n‘“Overbold,” said Hugh. “Hearken here,” and he read: “Upon the feast of\r\nSt. Agatha, our Lord of Pevensey, lying in his upper chamber, being\r\nclothed in his second fur gown reversed with rabbit——”\r\n\r\n‘“Pest on him! He is not my tire-woman!” said De Aquila, and Hugh and I\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n‘“Reversed with rabbit, seeing a fog over the marshes, did wake Sir\r\nRichard Dalyngridge, his drunken cup-mate” (here they laughed at me) “and\r\nsaid, ‘Peer out, old fox, for God is on the Duke of Normandy’s side.’”\r\n\r\n‘“So did I. It was a black fog. Robert could have landed ten thousand men,\r\nand we none the wiser. Does he tell how we were out all day riding the\r\nmarsh, and how I near perished in a quicksand, and coughed like a sick ewe\r\nfor ten days after?” cried De Aquila.\r\n\r\n‘“No,” said Hugh. “But here is the prayer of Gilbert himself to his master\r\nFulke.”\r\n\r\n‘“Ah,” said De Aquila. “Well I knew it was Fulke. What is the price of my\r\nblood?”\r\n\r\n‘“Gilbert prayeth that when our Lord of Pevensey is stripped of his lands\r\non this evidence which Gilbert hath, with fear and pains, collected——”\r\n\r\n‘“Fear and pains is a true word,” said De Aquila, and sucked in his\r\ncheeks. “But how excellent a weapon is a pen! I must learn it.”\r\n\r\n‘“He prays that Fulke will advance him from his present service to that\r\nhonour in the Church which Fulke promised him. And lest Fulke should\r\nforget, he has written below, ‘To be Sacristan of Battle.’”\r\n\r\n‘At this De Aquila whistled. “A man who can plot against one lord can plot\r\nagainst another. When I am stripped of my lands Fulke will whip off my\r\nGilbert’s foolish head. None the less Battle needs a new Sacristan. They\r\ntell me the Abbot Henry keeps no sort of rule there.”\r\n\r\n‘“Let the Abbot wait,” said Hugh. “It is our heads and our lands that are\r\nin danger. This parchment is the second part of the tale. The first has\r\ngone to Fulke, and so to the King, who will hold us traitors.”\r\n\r\n‘“Assuredly,” said De Aquila. “Fulke’s man took the first part that\r\nevening when Gilbert fed him, and our King is so beset by his brother and\r\nhis Barons (small blame, too!) that he is mad with mistrust. Fulke has his\r\near, and pours poison into it. Presently the King gives him my land and\r\nyours. This is old,” and he leaned back and yawned.\r\n\r\n‘“And thou wilt surrender Pevensey without word or blow?” said Hugh. “We\r\nSaxons will fight your King then. I will go warn my nephew at Dallington.\r\nGive me a horse!”\r\n\r\n‘“Give thee a toy and a rattle.” said De Aquila. “Put back the parchment,\r\nand rake over the ashes. If Fulke is given my Pevensey which is England’s\r\ngate, what will he do with it? He is Norman at heart, and his heart is in\r\nNormandy, where he can kill peasants at his pleasure. He will open\r\nEngland’s gate to our sleepy Robert, as Odo and Mortain tried to do, and\r\nthen there will be another landing and another Santlache. Therefore I\r\ncannot give up Pevensey.”\r\n\r\n‘“Good,” said we two.\r\n\r\n‘“Ah, but wait! If my King be made, on Gilbert’s evidence, to mistrust me,\r\nhe will send his men against me here, and, while we fight, England’s gate\r\nis left unguarded. Who will be the first to come through thereby? Even\r\nRobert of Normandy. Therefore I cannot fight my King.” He nursed his\r\nsword—thus.\r\n\r\n‘“This is saying and unsaying like a Norman,” said Hugh. “What of our\r\nManors?”\r\n\r\n‘“I do not think for myself,” said De Aquila, “nor for our King, nor for\r\nyour lands. I think for England, for whom neither King nor Baron thinks. I\r\nam not Norman, Sir Richard, nor Saxon, Sir Hugh. English am I.”\r\n\r\n‘“Saxon, Norman, or English,” said Hugh, “our lives are thine, however the\r\ngame goes. When do we hang Gilbert?”\r\n\r\n‘“Never,” said De Aquila. “Who knows he may yet be Sacristan of Battle,\r\nfor, to do him justice, he is a good writer. Dead men make dumb witnesses.\r\nWait.”\r\n\r\n‘“But the King may give Pevensey to Fulke. And our Manors go with it,”\r\nsaid I. “Shall we tell our sons?”\r\n\r\n‘“No. The King will not wake up a hornet’s nest in the South till he has\r\nsmoked out the bees in the North. He may hold me a traitor; but at least\r\nhe sees I am not fighting against him, and every day that I lie still is\r\nso much gain to him while he fights the barons. If he were wise he would\r\nwait till that war were over before he made new enemies. But I think Fulke\r\nwill play upon him to send for me, and if I do not obey the summons that\r\nwill, to Henry’s mind, be proof of my treason. But mere talk, such as\r\nGilbert sends, is no proof nowadays. We Barons follow the Church, and,\r\nlike Anselm, we speak what we please. Let us go about our day’s dealings,\r\nand say naught to Gilbert.”\r\n\r\n‘“Then we do nothing?” said Hugh.\r\n\r\n‘“We wait,” said De Aquila. “I am old, but still I find that the most\r\ngrievous work I know.”\r\n\r\n‘And so we found it, but in the end De Aquila was right.\r\n\r\n‘A little later in the year, armed men rode over the hill, the Golden\r\nHorseshoes flying behind the King’s banner. Said De Aquila, at the window\r\nof our chamber: “How did I tell you? Here comes Fulke himself to spy out\r\nhis new lands which our King hath promised him if he can bring proof of my\r\ntreason.”\r\n\r\n‘“How dost thou know?” said Hugh.\r\n\r\n‘“Because that is what I would do if I were Fulke, but _I_ should have\r\nbrought more men. My roan horse to your old shoes,” said he, “Fulke brings\r\nme the King’s Summons to leave Pevensey and join the war.” He sucked in\r\nhis cheeks and drummed on the edge of the shaft, where the water sounded\r\nall hollow.\r\n\r\n‘“Shall we go?” said I.\r\n\r\n‘“Go! At this time of year? Stark madness,” said he. “Take _me_ from\r\nPevensey to fisk and flyte through fern and forest, and in three days\r\nRobert’s keels would be lying on Pevensey mud with ten thousand men! Who\r\nwould stop them—Fulke?”\r\n\r\n‘The horns blew without, and anon Fulke cried the King’s Summons at the\r\ngreat door that De Aquila with all men and horse should join the King’s\r\ncamp at Salisbury.\r\n\r\n‘“How did I tell you?” said De Aquila. “There are twenty Barons ’twixt\r\nhere and Salisbury could give King Henry good land-service, but he has\r\nbeen worked upon by Fulke to send south and call me—_me!_—off the Gate of\r\nEngland, when his enemies stand about to batter it in. See that Fulke’s\r\nmen lie in the big south barn,” said he. “Give them drink, and when Fulke\r\nhas eaten we will drink in my chamber. The Great Hall is too cold for old\r\nbones.”\r\n\r\n‘As soon as he was off-horse Fulke went to the chapel with Gilbert to give\r\nthanks for his safe coming, and when he had eaten—he was a fat man, and\r\nrolled his eyes greedily at our good roast Sussex wheatears—we led him to\r\nthe little upper chamber, whither Gilbert had already gone with the\r\nManor-roll. I remember when Fulke heard the tide blow and whistle in the\r\nshaft he leaped back, and his long down-turned stirrup-shoes caught in the\r\nrushes and he stumbled, so that Jehan behind him found it easy to knock\r\nhis head against the wall.’\r\n\r\n‘Did you know it was going to happen?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Assuredly,’ said Sir Richard, with a sweet smile. ‘I put my foot on his\r\nsword and plucked away his dagger, but he knew not whether it was day or\r\nnight for a while. He lay rolling his eyes and bubbling with his mouth,\r\nand Jehan roped him like a calf. He was cased all in that new-fangled\r\narmour which we call lizard-mail. Not rings like my hauberk here’—Sir\r\nRichard tapped his chest—‘but little pieces of dagger-proof steel\r\noverlapping on stout leather. We stripped it off (no need to spoil good\r\nharness by wetting it), and in the neck-piece De Aquila found the same\r\nfolden piece of parchment which we had put back under the hearthstone.\r\n\r\n‘At this Gilbert would have run out. I laid my hand on his shoulder. It\r\nsufficed. He fell to trembling and praying on his beads.\r\n\r\n‘“Gilbert,” said De Aquila, “here be more notable sayings and doings of\r\nour Lord of Pevensey for thee to write down. Take penner and inkhorn,\r\nGilbert. We cannot all be Sacristans of Battle.”\r\n\r\n‘Said Fulke from the floor, “Ye have bound a King’s messenger. Pevensey\r\nshall burn for this!”\r\n\r\n‘“Maybe. I have seen it besieged once,” said De Aquila, “but heart up,\r\nFulke. I promise thee that thou shalt be hanged in the middle of the\r\nflames at the end of that siege, if I have to share my last loaf with\r\nthee; and that is more than Odo would have done when we starved out him\r\nand Mortain.”\r\n\r\n‘Then Fulke sat up and looked long and cunningly at De Aquila.\r\n\r\n‘“By the Saints,” said he, “why didst thou not say thou wast on the Duke’s\r\nside at the first?”\r\n\r\n‘“Am I?” said De Aquila.\r\n\r\n‘Fulke laughed and said, “No man who serves King Henry dare do this much\r\nto his messenger. When didst thou come over to the Duke? Let me up and we\r\ncan smooth it out together.” And he smiled and becked and winked.\r\n\r\n‘“Yes, we will smooth it out,” said De Aquila. He nodded to me, and Jehan\r\nand I heaved up Fulke—he was a heavy man—and lowered him into the shaft by\r\na rope, not so as to stand on our gold, but dangling by his shoulders a\r\nlittle above. It was turn of ebb, and the water came to his knees. He said\r\nnothing, but shivered somewhat.\r\n\r\n‘Then Jehan of a sudden beat down Gilbert’s wrist with his sheathed\r\ndagger, “Stop!” he said. “He swallows his beads.”\r\n\r\n‘“Poison, belike,” said De Aquila. “It is good for men who know too much.\r\nI have carried it these thirty years. Give me!”\r\n\r\n‘Then Gilbert wept and howled. De Aquila ran the beads through his\r\nfingers. The last one—I have said they were large nuts—opened in two\r\nhalves on a pin, and there was a small folded parchment within. On it was\r\nwritten: “_The Old Dog goes to Salisbury to be beaten. I have his Kennel.\r\nCome quickly._”\r\n\r\n‘“This is worse than poison,” said De Aquila, very softly, and sucked in\r\nhis cheeks. Then Gilbert grovelled in the rushes, and told us all he knew.\r\nThe letter, as we guessed, was from Fulke to the Duke (and not the first\r\nthat had passed between them); Fulke had given it to Gilbert in the\r\nchapel, and Gilbert thought to have taken it by morning to a certain\r\nfishing-boat at the wharf, which trafficked between Pevensey and the\r\nFrench shore. Gilbert was a false fellow, but he found time between his\r\nquakings and shakings to swear that the master of the boat knew nothing of\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n‘“He hath called me shaved head,” said Gilbert, “and he hath thrown\r\nhaddock-guts at me; but for all that, he is no traitor.”\r\n\r\n‘“I will have no clerk of mine mishandled or miscalled,” said De Aquila.\r\n“That seaman shall be whipped at his own mast. Write me first a letter,\r\nand thou shalt bear it, with the order for the whipping, to-morrow to the\r\nboat.”\r\n\r\n‘At this Gilbert would have kissed De Aquila’s hand—he had not hoped to\r\nlive until the morning—and when he trembled less he wrote a letter as from\r\nFulke to the Duke saying that the Kennel, which signified Pevensey, was\r\nshut, and that the old Dog (which was De Aquila) sat outside it, and,\r\nmoreover, that all had been betrayed.\r\n\r\n‘“Write to any man that all is betrayed,” said De Aquila, “and even the\r\nPope himself would sleep uneasily. Eh, Jehan? If one told thee all was\r\nbetrayed, what wouldst thou do?”\r\n\r\n‘“I would run away,” said Jehan. “It might be true.”\r\n\r\n‘“Well said,” quoth De Aquila. “Write, Gilbert, that Montgomery, the great\r\nEarl, hath made his peace with the King, and that little D’Arcy, whom I\r\nhate, hath been hanged by the heels. We will give Robert full measure to\r\nchew upon. Write also that Fulke himself is sick to death of a dropsy.”\r\n\r\n‘“Nay?” cried Fulke, hanging in the well-shaft. “Drown me out of hand, but\r\ndo not make a jest of me.”\r\n\r\n‘“Jest? I?” said De Aquila. “I am but fighting for life and lands with a\r\npen, as thou hast shown me, Fulke.”\r\n\r\n‘Then Fulke groaned, for he was cold, and, “Let me confess,” said he.\r\n\r\n‘“Now, this is right neighbourly,” said De Aquila, leaning over the shaft.\r\n“Thou hast read my sayings and doings—or at least the first part of\r\nthem—and thou art minded to repay me with thy own doings and sayings. Take\r\npenner and inkhorn, Gilbert. Here is work that will not irk thee.”\r\n\r\n‘“Let my men go without hurt, and I will confess my treason against the\r\nKing,” said Fulke.\r\n\r\n‘“Now, why has he grown so tender of his men of a sudden?” said Hugh to\r\nme; for Fulke had no name for mercy to his men. Plunder he gave them, but\r\npity, none.\r\n\r\n‘“Té! Té!” said De Aquila. “Thy treason was all confessed long ago by\r\nGilbert. It would be enough to hang Montgomery himself.”\r\n\r\n‘“Nay; but spare my men,” said Fulke; and we heard him splash like a fish\r\nin a pond, for the tide was rising.\r\n\r\n‘“All in good time,” said De Aquila. “The night is young; the wine is old;\r\nand we need only the merry tale. Begin the story of thy life since when\r\nthou wast a lad at Tours. Tell it nimbly!”\r\n\r\n‘“Ye shame me to my soul,” said Fulke.\r\n\r\n‘“Then I have done what neither King nor Duke could do,” said De Aquila.\r\n“But begin, and forget nothing.”\r\n\r\n‘“Send thy man away,” said Fulke.\r\n\r\n‘“That much I can,” said De Aquila. “But, remember, I am like the Danes’\r\nKing; I cannot turn the tide.”\r\n\r\n‘“How long will it rise?” said Fulke, and splashed anew.\r\n\r\n‘“For three hours,” said De Aquila. “Time to tell all thy good deeds.\r\nBegin, and Gilbert—I have heard thou art somewhat careless—do not twist\r\nhis words from their true meaning.”\r\n\r\n‘So—fear of death in the dark being upon him—Fulke began; and Gilbert, not\r\nknowing what his fate might be, wrote it word by word. I have heard many\r\ntales, but never heard I aught to match the tale of Fulke, his black life,\r\nas Fulke told it hollowly, hanging in the shaft.’\r\n\r\n‘Was it bad?’ said Dan, awestruck.\r\n\r\n‘Beyond belief,’ Sir Richard answered. ‘None the less, there was that in\r\nit which forced even Gilbert to laugh. We three laughed till we ached. At\r\none place his teeth so chattered that we could not well hear, and we\r\nreached him down a cup of wine. Then he warmed to it, and smoothly set out\r\nall his shifts, malices, and treacheries, his extreme boldnesses (he was\r\ndesperate bold); his retreats, shufflings, and counterfeitings (he was\r\nalso inconceivably a coward); his lack of gear and honour; his despair at\r\ntheir loss; his remedies, and well-coloured contrivances. Yes, he waved\r\nthe filthy rags of his life before us, as though they had been some proud\r\nbanner. When he ceased, we saw by torches that the tide stood at the\r\ncorners of his mouth, and he breathed strongly through his nose.\r\n\r\n‘We had him out, and rubbed him; we wrapped him in a cloak, and gave him\r\nwine, and we leaned and looked upon him the while he drank. He was\r\nshivering, but shameless.\r\n\r\n‘Of a sudden we heard Jehan at the stairway wake, but a boy pushed past\r\nhim, and stood before us, the hall rushes in his hair, all slubbered with\r\nsleep. “My father! My father! I dreamed of treachery,” he cried, and\r\nbabbled thickly.\r\n\r\n‘“There is no treachery here,” said Fulke. “Go,” and the boy turned, even\r\nthen not fully awake, and Jehan led him by the hand to the Great Hall.\r\n\r\n‘“Thy only son!” said De Aquila, “Why didst thou bring the child here?”\r\n\r\n‘“He is my heir. I dared not trust him to my brother,” said Fulke, and now\r\nhe was ashamed. De Aquila said nothing, but sat weighing a wine cup in his\r\ntwo hands—thus. Anon, Fulke touched him on the knee.\r\n\r\n‘“Let the boy escape to Normandy,” said he, “and do with me at thy\r\npleasure. Yea, hang me to-morrow, with my letter to Robert round my neck,\r\nbut let the boy go.”\r\n\r\n‘“Be still,” said De Aquila. “I think for England.”\r\n\r\n‘So we waited what our Lord of Pevensey should devise; and the sweat ran\r\ndown Fulke’s forehead.\r\n\r\n‘At last said De Aquila: “I am too old to judge, or to trust any man. I do\r\nnot covet thy lands, as thou hast coveted mine; and whether thou art any\r\nbetter or any worse than any other black Angevin thief, it is for thy King\r\nto find out. Therefore, go back to thy King, Fulke.”\r\n\r\n‘“And thou wilt say nothing of what has passed?” said Fulke.\r\n\r\n‘“Why should I? Thy son will stay with me. If the King calls me again to\r\nleave Pevensey, which I must guard against England’s enemies; if the King\r\nsends his men against me for a traitor; or if I hear that the King in his\r\nbed thinks any evil of me or my two knights, thy son will be hanged from\r\nout this window, Fulke.”’\r\n\r\n‘But it hadn’t anything to do with his son,’ cried Una, startled.\r\n\r\n‘How could we have hanged Fulke?’ said Sir Richard. ‘We needed him to make\r\nour peace with the King. He would have betrayed half England for the boy’s\r\nsake. Of that we were sure.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t understand,’ said Una. ‘But I think it was simply awful.’\r\n\r\n‘So did not Fulke. He was well pleased.’\r\n\r\n‘What? Because his son was going to be killed?’\r\n\r\n‘Nay. Because De Aquila had shown him how he might save the boy’s life and\r\nhis own lands and honours. “I will do it,” he said. “I swear I will do it.\r\nI will tell the King thou art no traitor, but the most excellent, valiant,\r\nand perfect of us all. Yes, I will save thee.”\r\n\r\n‘De Aquila looked still into the bottom of the cup, rolling the wine-dregs\r\nto and fro.\r\n\r\n‘“Ay,” he said. “If I had a son, I would, I think, save him. But do not by\r\nany means tell me how thou wilt go about it.”\r\n\r\n‘“Nay, nay,” said Fulke, nodding his bald head wisely. “That is my secret.\r\nBut rest at ease, De Aquila, no hair of thy head nor rood of thy land\r\nshall be forfeited,” and he smiled like one planning great good deeds.\r\n\r\n‘“And henceforward,” said De Aquila, “I counsel thee to serve one\r\nmaster—not two.”\r\n\r\n‘“What?” said Fulke. “Can I work no more honest trading between the two\r\nsides these troublous times?”\r\n\r\n‘“Serve Robert or the King—England or Normandy,” said De Aquila. “I care\r\nnot which it is, but make thy choice here and now.”\r\n\r\n‘“The King, then,” said Fulke, “for I see he is better served than Robert.\r\nShall I swear it?”\r\n\r\n‘“No need,” said De Aquila, and he laid his hand on the parchments which\r\nGilbert had written. “It shall be some part of my Gilbert’s penance to\r\ncopy out the savoury tale of thy life, till we have made ten, twenty, an\r\nhundred, maybe, copies. How many cattle, think you, would the Bishop of\r\nTours give for that tale? Or thy brother? Or the Monks of Blois? Minstrels\r\nwill turn it into songs which thy own Saxon serfs shall sing behind their\r\nplough-stilts, and men-at-arms riding through thy Norman towns. From here\r\nto Rome, Fulke, men will make very merry over that tale, and how Fulke\r\ntold it, hanging in a well, like a drowned puppy. This shall be thy\r\npunishment, if ever I find thee double-dealing with thy King any more.\r\nMeantime, the parchments stay here with thy son. Him I will return to thee\r\nwhen thou hast made my peace with the King. The parchments never.”\r\n\r\n‘Fulke hid his face and groaned.\r\n\r\n‘“Bones of the Saints!” said De Aquila, laughing. “The pen cuts deep. I\r\ncould never have fetched that grunt out of thee with any sword.”\r\n\r\n‘“But so long as I do not anger thee, my tale will be secret?” said Fulke.\r\n\r\n‘“Just so long. Does that comfort thee, Fulke?” said De Aquila.\r\n\r\n‘“What other comfort have ye left me?” he said, and of a sudden he wept\r\nhopelessly like a child, dropping his face on his knees.’\r\n\r\n‘Poor Fulke,’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘I pitied him also,’ said Sir Richard.\r\n\r\n‘“After the spur, corn,” said De Aquila, and he threw Fulke three wedges\r\nof gold that he had taken from our little chest by the bed-place.\r\n\r\n‘“If I had known this,” said Fulke, catching his breath, “I would never\r\nhave lifted hand against Pevensey. Only lack of this yellow stuff has made\r\nme so unlucky in my dealings.”\r\n\r\n‘It was dawn then, and they stirred in the Great Hall below. We sent down\r\nFulke’s mail to be scoured, and when he rode away at noon under his own\r\nand the King’s banner very splendid and stately did he show. He smoothed\r\nhis long beard, and called his son to his stirrup and kissed him. De\r\nAquila rode with him as far as the New Mill landward. We thought the night\r\nhad been all a dream.’\r\n\r\n‘But did he make it right with the King?’ Dan asked. ‘About your not being\r\ntraitors, I mean?’\r\n\r\nSir Richard smiled. ‘The King sent no second summons to Pevensey, nor did\r\nhe ask why De Aquila had not obeyed the first. Yes, that was Fulke’s work.\r\nI know not how he did it, but it was well and swiftly done.’\r\n\r\n‘Then you didn’t do anything to his son?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘The boy? Oh, he was an imp. He turned the keep doors out of dortoirs\r\nwhile we had him. He sang foul songs, learned in the Barons’ camps—poor\r\nfool; he set the hounds fighting in hall; he lit the rushes to drive out,\r\nas he said, the fleas; he drew his dagger on Jehan, who threw him down the\r\nstairway for it; and he rode his horse through crops and among sheep. But\r\nwhen we had beaten him, and showed him wolf and deer, he followed us old\r\nmen like a young, eager hound, and called us “uncle.” His father came the\r\nsummer’s end to take him away, but the boy had no lust to go, because of\r\nthe otter-hunting, and he stayed on till the fox-hunting. I gave him a\r\nbittern’s claw to bring him good luck at shooting. An imp, if ever there\r\nwas!’\r\n\r\n‘And what happened to Gilbert?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Not even a whipping. De Aquila said he would sooner a clerk, however\r\nfalse, that knew the Manor-roll than a fool, however true, that must be\r\ntaught his work afresh. Moreover, after that night I think Gilbert loved\r\nas much as he feared De Aquila. At least he would not leave us—not even\r\nwhen Vivian, the King’s Clerk, would have made him Sacristan of Battle\r\nAbbey. A false fellow, but, in his fashion, bold.’\r\n\r\n‘Did Robert ever land in Pevensey after all?’ Dan went on.\r\n\r\n‘We guarded the coast too well while Henry was fighting his Barons; and\r\nthree or four years later, when England had peace, Henry crossed to\r\nNormandy and showed his brother some work at Tenchebrai that cured Robert\r\nof fighting. Many of Henry’s men sailed from Pevensey to that war. Fulke\r\ncame, I remember, and we all four lay in the little chamber once again,\r\nand drank together. De Aquila was right. One should not judge men. Fulke\r\nwas merry. Yes, always merry—with a catch in his breath.’\r\n\r\n‘And what did you do afterwards?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘We talked together of times past. That is all men can do when they grow\r\nold, little maid.’\r\n\r\nThe bell for tea rang faintly across the meadows. Dan lay in the bows of\r\nthe _Golden Hind_; Una in the stern, the book of verses open in her lap,\r\nwas reading from ‘The Slave’s Dream’:—\r\n\r\n  ‘Again in the mist and shadow of sleep\r\n  He saw his native land.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t know when you began that,’ said Dan, sleepily.\r\n\r\nOn the middle thwart of the boat, beside Una’s sun-bonnet, lay an Oak\r\nleaf, an Ash leaf, and a Thorn leaf, that must have dropped down from the\r\ntrees above; and the brook giggled as though it had just seen some joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUNES ON WELAND’S SWORD\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Smith makes me_\r\n  _To betray my Man_\r\n  _In my first fight._\r\n\r\n  _To gather Gold_\r\n  _At the world’s end_\r\n  _I am sent._\r\n\r\n  _The Gold I gather_\r\n  _Comes into England_\r\n  _Out of deep Water._\r\n\r\n  _Like a shining Fish_\r\n  _Then it descends_\r\n  _Into deep Water._\r\n\r\n  _It is not given_\r\n  _For goods or gear._\r\n  _But for The Thing_\r\n\r\n  _The Gold I gather_\r\n  _A King covets_\r\n  _For an ill use._\r\n\r\n  _The Gold I gather_\r\n  _Is drawn up_\r\n  _Out of deep Water._\r\n\r\n  _Like a shining Fish_\r\n  _Then it descends_\r\n  _Into deep Water._\r\n\r\n  _It is not given_\r\n  _For goods or gear_\r\n  _But for The Thing._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CENTURION OF THE THIRTIETH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Cities and Thrones and Powers,_\r\n    _Stand in Time’s eye,_\r\n  _Almost as long as flowers,_\r\n    _Which daily die:_\r\n  _But, as new buds put forth,_\r\n    _To glad new men,_\r\n  _Out of the spent and unconsidered Earth,_\r\n    _The Cities rise again._\r\n\r\n  _This season’s Daffodil,_\r\n    _She never hears,_\r\n  _What change, what chance, what chill,_\r\n    _Cut down last year’s;_\r\n  _But with bold countenance,_\r\n    _And knowledge small,_\r\n  _Esteems her seven days’ continuance_\r\n    _To be perpetual._\r\n\r\n  _So Time that is o’er-kind,_\r\n    _To all that be,_\r\n  _Ordains us e’en as blind,_\r\n    _As bold as she:_\r\n  _That in our very death,_\r\n    _And burial sure,_\r\n  _Shadow to shadow, well-persuaded, saith,_\r\n    _‘See how our works endure!’_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CENTURION OF THE THIRTIETH\r\n\r\n\r\nDan had come to grief over his Latin, and was kept in; so Una went alone\r\nto Far Wood. Dan’s big catapult and the lead bullets that Hobden had made\r\nfor him were hidden in an old hollow beech-stub on the west of the wood.\r\nThey had named the place out of the verse in _Lays of Ancient Rome_.\r\n\r\n  From lordly Volaterrae,\r\n    Where scowls the far-famed hold,\r\n  Piled by the hands of giants\r\n    For Godlike Kings of old.\r\n\r\nThey were the ‘Godlike Kings,’ and when old Hobden piled some comfortable\r\nbrushwood between the big wooden knees of Volaterrae, they called him\r\n‘Hands of Giants.’\r\n\r\nUna slipped through their private gap in the fence, and sat still a while,\r\nscowling as scowlily and lordlily as she knew how; for ‘Volaterrae’ is an\r\nimportant watch-tower that juts out of Far Wood just as Far Wood juts out\r\nof the hillside. Pook’s Hill lay below her, and all the turns of the brook\r\nas it wanders from out of the Willingford Woods, between hop-gardens, to\r\nold Hobden’s cottage at the Forge. The Sou’-West wind (there is always a\r\nwind by ‘Volaterrae’) blew from the bare ridge where Cherry Clack Windmill\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nNow wind prowling through woods sounds like exciting things going to\r\nhappen, and that is why on ‘blowy days’ you stand up in Volaterrae and\r\nshout bits of the _Lays_ to suit its noises.\r\n\r\nUna took Dan’s catapult from its secret place, and made ready to meet Lars\r\nPorsena’s army stealing through the wind-whitened aspens by the brook. A\r\ngust boomed up the valley, and Una chanted sorrowfully:\r\n\r\n  ‘Verbenna down to Ostia\r\n    Hath wasted all the plain;\r\n  Astur hath stormed Janiculum\r\n    And the stout guards are slain.’\r\n\r\nBut the wind, not charging fair to the wood, started aside and shook a\r\nsingle oak in Gleason’s pasture. Here it made itself all small and\r\ncrouched among the grasses, waving the tips of them as a cat waves the tip\r\nof her tail before she springs.\r\n\r\n‘Now welcome—welcome Sextus,’ sang Una, loading the catapult—\r\n\r\n    ‘Now welcome to thy home,\r\n  Why dost thou turn and run away?\r\n    Here lies the rod of Rome.’\r\n\r\nShe fired into the face of the lull, to wake up the cowardly wind, and\r\nheard a grunt from behind a thorn in the pasture.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, my Winkie!’ she said aloud, and that was something she had picked up\r\nfrom Dan. ‘I believe I’ve tickled up a Gleason cow.’\r\n\r\n‘You little painted beast!’ a voice cried. ‘I’ll teach you to sling your\r\nmasters!’\r\n\r\nShe looked down most cautiously, and saw a young man covered with hoopy\r\nbronze armour all glowing among the late broom. But what Una admired\r\nbeyond all was his great bronze helmet with its red horse-tail that\r\nflicked in the wind. She could hear the long hairs rasp on his shimmery\r\nshoulder-plates.\r\n\r\n‘What does the Faun mean,’ he said, half aloud to himself, ‘by telling me\r\nthe Painted People have changed?’ He caught sight of Una’s yellow head.\r\n‘Have you seen a painted lead-slinger?’ he called.\r\n\r\n‘No-o,’ said Una. ‘But if you’ve seen a bullet——’\r\n\r\n‘Seen?’ cried the man. ‘It passed within a hair’s breadth of my ear.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, that was me. I’m most awfully sorry.’\r\n\r\n‘Didn’t the Faun tell you I was coming?’ He smiled.\r\n\r\n‘Not if you mean Puck. I thought you were a Gleason cow. I—I didn’t know\r\nyou were a—a——What are you?’\r\n\r\nHe laughed outright, showing a set of splendid teeth. His face and eyes\r\nwere dark, and his eyebrows met above his big nose in one bushy black bar.\r\n\r\n‘They call me Parnesius. I have been an officer of the Seventh Cohort of\r\nthe Thirtieth Legion—the Ulpia Victrix. Did you sling that bullet?’\r\n\r\n‘I did. I was using Dan’s catapult,’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Catapults!’ said he. ‘I ought to know something about them. Show me!’\r\n\r\nHe leaped the rough fence with a rattle of spear, shield, and armour, and\r\nhoisted himself into ‘Volaterrae’ as quickly as a shadow.\r\n\r\n‘A sling on a forked stick. _I_ understand!’ he cried, and pulled at the\r\nelastic. ‘But what wonderful beast yields this stretching leather?’\r\n\r\n‘It’s laccy—elastic. You put the bullet into that loop, and then you pull\r\nhard.’\r\n\r\nThe man pulled, and hit himself square on his thumb-nail.\r\n\r\n‘Each to his own weapon,’ he said, gravely, handing it back. ‘I am better\r\nwith the bigger machine, little maiden. But it’s a pretty toy. A wolf\r\nwould laugh at it. Aren’t you afraid of wolves?’\r\n\r\n‘There aren’t any,’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Never believe it! A wolf is like a Winged Hat. He comes when he isn’t\r\nexpected. Don’t they hunt wolves here?’\r\n\r\n‘We don’t hunt,’ said Una, remembering what she had heard from grown-ups.\r\n‘We preserve—pheasants. Do you know them?’\r\n\r\n‘I ought to,’ said the young man, smiling again, and he imitated the cry\r\nof the cock-pheasant so perfectly that a bird answered out of the wood.\r\n\r\n‘What a big painted clucking fool is a pheasant,’ he said. ‘Just like some\r\nRomans!’\r\n\r\n‘But you’re a Roman yourself, aren’t you?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Ye-es and no. I’m one of a good few thousands who have never seen Rome\r\nexcept in a picture. My people have lived at Vectis for generations.\r\nVectis! That island West yonder that you can see from so far in clear\r\nweather.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you mean the Isle of Wight? It lifts up just before rain, and we see\r\nit from the Downs.’\r\n\r\n‘Very likely. Our Villa’s on the South edge of the Island, by the Broken\r\nCliffs. Most of it is three hundred years old, but the cow-stables, where\r\nour first ancestor lived, must be a hundred years older. Oh, quite that,\r\nbecause the founder of our family had his land given him by Agricola at\r\nthe Settlement. It’s not a bad little place for its size. In spring-time\r\nviolets grow down to the very beach. I’ve gathered sea-weeds for myself\r\nand violets for my Mother many a time with our old nurse.’\r\n\r\n‘Was your nurse a—a Romaness too?’\r\n\r\n‘No, a Numidian. Gods be good to her! A dear, fat, brown thing with a\r\ntongue like a cowbell. She was a free woman. By the way, are you free,\r\nmaiden?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, quite,’ said Una. ‘At least, till tea-time; and in summer our\r\ngoverness doesn’t say much if we’re late.’\r\n\r\nThe young man laughed again—a proper understanding laugh.\r\n\r\n‘I see,’ said he. ‘That accounts for your being in the wood. _We_ hid\r\namong the cliffs.’\r\n\r\n‘Did _you_ have a governess, then?’\r\n\r\n‘Did we not? A Greek, too. She had a way of clutching her dress when she\r\nhunted us among the gorze-bushes that made us laugh. Then she’d say she’d\r\nget us whipped. She never did, though, bless her! Aglaia was a thorough\r\nsportswoman, for all her learning.’\r\n\r\n‘But what lessons did you do—when—when you were little!’\r\n\r\n‘Ancient history, the Classics, arithmetic, and so on,’ he answered. ‘My\r\nsister and I were thickheads, but my two brothers (I’m the middle one)\r\nliked those things, and, of course, Mother was clever enough for any six.\r\nShe was nearly as tall as I am, and she looked like the new statue on the\r\nWestern Road—the Demeter of the Baskets, you know. And funny! Roma Dea!\r\nHow Mother could make us laugh!’\r\n\r\n‘What at?’\r\n\r\n‘Little jokes and sayings that every family has. Don’t you know?’\r\n\r\n‘I know _we_ have, but I didn’t know other people had them too,’ said Una.\r\n‘Tell me about all your family, please.’\r\n\r\n‘Good families are very much alike. Mother would sit spinning of evenings\r\nwhile Aglaia read in her corner, and Father did accounts, and we four\r\nromped about the passages. When our noise grew too loud the Pater would\r\nsay, “Less tumult! Less tumult! Have you never heard of a Father’s right\r\nover his children? He can slay them, my loves—slay them dead, and the Gods\r\nhighly approve of the action!” Then Mother would prim up her dear mouth\r\nover the wheel and answer: “H’m! I’m afraid there can’t be much of the\r\nRoman Father about you!” Then the Pater would roll up his accounts, and\r\nsay, “I’ll show you!” and then—then, he’d be worse than any of us!’\r\n\r\n‘Fathers can—if they like,’ said Una, her eyes dancing.\r\n\r\n‘Didn’t I say all good families are very much the same?’\r\n\r\n‘What did you do in summer?’ said Una. ‘Play about, like us?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, and we visited our friends. There are no wolves in Vectis. We had\r\nmany friends, and as many ponies as we wished.’\r\n\r\n‘It must have been lovely,’ said Una. ‘I hope it lasted for ever.’\r\n\r\n‘Not quite, little maid. When I was about sixteen or seventeen, the Father\r\nfelt gouty, and we all went to the Waters.’\r\n\r\n‘What waters?’\r\n\r\n‘At Aquae Solis. Every one goes there. You ought to get your Father to\r\ntake you some day.’\r\n\r\n‘But where? I don’t know,’ said Una.\r\n\r\nThe young man looked astonished for a moment. ‘Aquae Solis,’ he repeated.\r\n‘The best baths in Britain. Just as good, I’m told, as Rome. All the old\r\ngluttons sit in its hot water, and talk scandal and politics. And the\r\nGenerals come through the streets with their guards behind them; and the\r\nmagistrates come in their chairs with their stiff guards behind them; and\r\nyou meet fortune-tellers, and goldsmiths, and merchants, and philosophers,\r\nand feather-sellers, and ultra-Roman Britons, and ultra-British Romans,\r\nand tame tribesmen pretending to be civilised, and Jew lecturers, and—oh,\r\neverybody interesting. We young people, of course, took no interest in\r\npolitics. We had not the gout: there were many of our age like us. We did\r\nnot find life sad.\r\n\r\n‘But while we were enjoying ourselves without thinking, my sister met the\r\nson of a magistrate in the West—and a year afterwards she was married to\r\nhim. My young brother, who was always interested in plants and roots, met\r\nthe First Doctor of a Legion from the City of the Legions, and he decided\r\nthat he would be an Army doctor. I do not think it is a profession for a\r\nwell-born man, but then—I’m not my brother. He went to Rome to study\r\nmedicine, and now he’s First Doctor of a Legion in Egypt—at Antinoe, I\r\nthink, but I have not heard from him for some time.\r\n\r\n‘My eldest brother came across a Greek philosopher, and told my Father\r\nthat he intended to settle down on the estate as a farmer and a\r\nphilosopher. You see’—the young man’s eyes twinkled—‘his philosopher was a\r\nlong-haired one!’\r\n\r\n‘I thought philosophers were bald,’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Not all. She was very pretty. I don’t blame him. Nothing could have\r\nsuited me better than my eldest brother’s doing this, for I was only too\r\nkeen to join the Army. I had always feared I should have to stay at home\r\nand look after the estate while my brother took _this_.’\r\n\r\nHe rapped on his great glistening shield that never seemed to be in his\r\nway.\r\n\r\n‘So we were well contented—we young people—and we rode back to Clausentum\r\nalong the Wood Road very quietly. But when we reached home, Aglaia, our\r\ngoverness, saw what had come to us. I remember her at the door, the torch\r\nover her head, watching us climb the cliff-path from the boat. “Aie! Aie!”\r\nshe said. “Children you went away. Men and a woman you return!” Then she\r\nkissed Mother, and Mother wept. Thus our visit to the Waters settled our\r\nfates for each of us, Maiden.’\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet and listened, leaning on the shield-rim.\r\n\r\n‘I think that’s Dan—my brother,’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Yes; and the Faun is with him,’ he replied, as Dan with Puck stumbled\r\nthrough the copse.\r\n\r\n‘We should have come sooner,’ Puck called, ‘but the beauties of your\r\nnative tongue, O Parnesius, have enthralled this young citizen.’\r\n\r\nParnesius looked bewildered, even when Una explained.\r\n\r\n‘Dan said the plural of “dominus” was “dominoes,” and when Miss Blake said\r\nit wasn’t he said he supposed it was “backgammon,” and so he had to write\r\nit out twice—for cheek, you know.’\r\n\r\nDan had climbed into Volaterrae, hot and panting.\r\n\r\n‘I’ve run nearly all the way,’ he gasped, ‘and then Puck met me. How do\r\nyou do, Sir?’\r\n\r\n‘I am in good health,’ Parnesius answered. ‘See! I have tried to bend the\r\nbow of Ulysses, but——’ He held up his thumb.\r\n\r\n‘I’m sorry. You must have pulled off too soon,’ said Dan. ‘Puck said you\r\nwere telling Una a story.’\r\n\r\n‘Continue, O Parnesius,’ said Puck, who had perched himself on a dead\r\nbranch above them. ‘I will be chorus. Has he puzzled you much, Una?’\r\n\r\n‘Not a bit, except—I didn’t know where Ak—Ak something was,’ she answered.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Aquae Solis. That’s Bath, where the buns come from. Let the hero tell\r\nhis own tale.’\r\n\r\nParnesius pretended to thrust his spear at Puck’s legs, but Puck reached\r\ndown, caught at the horse-tail plume, and pulled off the tall helmet.\r\n\r\n‘Thanks, jester,’ said Parnesius, shaking his curly dark head. ‘That is\r\ncooler. Now hang it up for me....\r\n\r\n‘I was telling your sister how I joined the Army,’ he said to Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Did you have to pass an Exam?’ Dan asked, eagerly.\r\n\r\n‘No. I went to my Father, and said I should like to enter the Dacian Horse\r\n(I had seen some at Aquae Solis); but he said I had better begin service\r\nin a regular Legion from Rome. Now, like many of our youngsters, I was not\r\ntoo fond of anything Roman. The Roman-born officers and magistrates looked\r\ndown on us British-born as though we were barbarians. I told my Father so.\r\n\r\n‘“I know they do,” he said; “but remember, after all, we are the people of\r\nthe Old Stock, and our duty is to the Empire.”\r\n\r\n‘“To which Empire?’” I asked. “We split the Eagle before I was born.”\r\n\r\n‘“What thieves’ talk is that?” said my Father. He hated slang.\r\n\r\n‘“Well, Sir,” I said, “we’ve one Emperor in Rome, and I don’t know how\r\nmany Emperors the outlying Provinces have set up from time to time. Which\r\nam I to follow?”\r\n\r\n‘“Gratian,” said he. “At least he’s a sportsman.”\r\n\r\n‘“He’s all that,” I said. “Hasn’t he turned himself into a raw-beef-eating\r\nScythian?”\r\n\r\n‘“Where did you hear of it?” said the Pater.\r\n\r\n‘“At Aquae Solis,” I said. It was perfectly true. This precious Emperor\r\nGratian of ours had a bodyguard of fur-cloaked Scythians, and he was so\r\ncrazy about them that he dressed like them. In Rome of all places in the\r\nworld! It was as bad as if my own Father had painted himself blue!\r\n\r\n‘“No matter for the clothes,” said the Pater. “They are only the fringe of\r\nthe trouble. It began before your time or mine. Rome has forsaken her\r\nGods, and must be punished. The great war with the Painted People broke\r\nout in the very year the temples of our Gods were destroyed. We beat the\r\nPainted People in the very year our temples were rebuilt. Go back further\r\nstill.”... He went back to the time of Diocletian; and to listen to him\r\nyou would have thought Eternal Rome herself was on the edge of\r\ndestruction, just because a few people had become a little large-minded.\r\n\r\n‘_I_ knew nothing about it. Aglaia never taught us the history of our own\r\ncountry. She was so full of her ancient Greeks.\r\n\r\n‘“There is no hope for Rome,” said the Pater, at last. “She has forsaken\r\nher Gods, but if the Gods forgive _us_ here, we may save Britain. To do\r\nthat, we must keep the Painted People back. Therefore, I tell you,\r\nParnesius, as a Father, that if your heart is set on service, your place\r\nis among men on the Wall—and not with women among the cities.”’\r\n\r\n‘What Wall?’ asked Dan and Una at once.\r\n\r\n‘Father meant the one we call Hadrian’s Wall. I’ll tell you about it\r\nlater. It was built long ago, across North Britain, to keep out the\r\nPainted People—Picts you call them. Father had fought in the great Pict\r\nWar that lasted more than twenty years, and he knew what fighting meant.\r\nTheodosius, one of our great Generals, had chased the little beasts back\r\nfar into the North before I was born: down at Vectis, of course, we never\r\ntroubled our heads about them. But when my Father spoke as he did, I\r\nkissed his hand, and waited for orders. We British-born Romans know what\r\nis due to our parents.’\r\n\r\n‘If I kissed my Father’s hand, he’d laugh,’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Customs change; but if you do not obey your father, the Gods remember it.\r\nYou may be quite sure of _that_.\r\n\r\n‘After our talk, seeing I was in earnest, the Pater sent me over to\r\nClausentum to learn my foot-drill in a barrack full of foreign\r\nAuxiliaries—as unwashed and unshaved a mob of mixed barbarians as ever\r\nscrubbed a breast-plate. It was your stick in their stomachs and your\r\nshield in their faces to push them into any sort of formation. When I had\r\nlearned my work the Instructor gave me a handful—and they were a\r\nhandful!—of Gauls and Iberians to polish up till they were sent to their\r\nstations up-country. I did my best, and one night a villa in the suburbs\r\ncaught fire, and I had my handful out and at work before any of the other\r\ntroops. I noticed a quiet-looking man on the lawn, leaning on a stick. He\r\nwatched us passing buckets from the pond, and at last he said to me: “Who\r\nare you?”\r\n\r\n‘“A probationer, waiting for a cohort,” I answered. _I_ didn’t know who he\r\nwas from Deucalion!\r\n\r\n‘“Born in Britain?” he said.\r\n\r\n‘“Yes, if you were born in Spain,” I said, for he neighed his words like\r\nan Iberian mule.\r\n\r\n‘“And what might you call yourself when you are at home?” he said\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n‘“That depends,” I answered; “sometimes one thing and sometimes another.\r\nBut now I’m busy.”\r\n\r\n‘He said no more till we had saved the family gods (they were respectable\r\nhouseholders), and then he grunted across the laurels: “Listen, young\r\nsometimes-one-thing-and-sometimes-another. In future call yourself\r\nCenturion of the Seventh Cohort of the Thirtieth, the Ulpia Victrix. That\r\nwill help me to remember you. Your Father and a few other people call me\r\nMaximus.”\r\n\r\n‘He tossed me the polished stick he was leaning on, and went away. You\r\nmight have knocked me down with it!’\r\n\r\n‘Who was he?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Maximus himself, our great General! _The_ General of Britain who had been\r\nTheodosius’s right hand in the Pict War! Not only had he given me my\r\nCenturion’s stick direct, but three steps in a good Legion as well! A new\r\nman generally begins in the Tenth Cohort of his Legion, and works up.’\r\n\r\n‘And were you pleased?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Very. I thought Maximus had chosen me for my good looks and fine style in\r\nmarching, but, when I went home, the Pater told me he had served under\r\nMaximus in the great Pict War, and had asked him to promote me.’\r\n\r\n‘A child you were!’ said Puck, from above.\r\n\r\n‘I was,’ said Parnesius. ‘Don’t begrudge it me, Faun. Afterwards—the Gods\r\nknow I put aside the games!’ And Puck nodded, brown chin on brown hand,\r\nhis big eyes still.\r\n\r\n‘The night before I left we sacrificed to our ancestors—the usual little\r\nHome Sacrifice—but I never prayed so earnestly to all the Good Shades, and\r\nthen I went with my Father by boat to Regnum, and across the chalk\r\neastwards to Anderida yonder.’\r\n\r\n‘Regnum? Anderida?’ The children turned their faces to Puck.\r\n\r\n‘Regnum’s Chichester,’ he said, pointing towards Cherry Clack, and—he\r\nthrew his arm South behind him—‘Anderida’s Pevensey.’\r\n\r\n‘Pevensey again!’ said Dan. ‘Where Weland landed?’\r\n\r\n‘Weland and a few others,’ said Puck. ‘Pevensey isn’t young—even compared\r\nto me!’\r\n\r\n‘The head-quarters of the Thirtieth lay at Anderida in summer, but my own\r\nCohort, the Seventh, was on the Wall up North. Maximus was inspecting\r\nAuxiliaries—the Abulci, I think—at Anderida, and we stayed with him, for\r\nhe and my Father were very old friends. I was only there ten days when I\r\nwas ordered to go up with thirty men to my Cohort.’ He laughed merrily. ‘A\r\nman never forgets his first march. I was happier than any Emperor when I\r\nled my handful through the North Gate of the Camp, and we saluted the\r\nguard and the Altar of Victory there.’\r\n\r\n‘How? How?’ said Dan and Una.\r\n\r\nParnesius smiled, and stood up, flashing in his armour.\r\n\r\n‘So!’ said he; and he moved slowly through the beautiful movements of the\r\nRoman Salute, that ends with a hollow clang of the shield coming into its\r\nplace between the shoulders.\r\n\r\n‘Hai!’ said Puck. ‘That sets one thinking!’\r\n\r\n‘We went out fully armed,’ said Parnesius, sitting down; ‘but as soon as\r\nthe road entered the Great Forest, my men expected the pack-horses to hang\r\ntheir shields on. “No!” I said; “you can dress like women in Anderida, but\r\nwhile you’re with me you will carry your own weapons and armour.”\r\n\r\n‘“But it’s hot,” said one of them, “and we haven’t a doctor. Suppose we\r\nget sunstroke, or a fever?”\r\n\r\n‘“Then die,” I said, “and a good riddance to Rome! Up shield—up spears,\r\nand tighten your foot-wear!”\r\n\r\n‘“Don’t think yourself Emperor of Britain already,” a fellow shouted. I\r\nknocked him over with the butt of my spear, and explained to these\r\nRoman-born Romans that, if there were any further trouble, we should go on\r\nwith one man short. And, by the Light of the Sun, I meant it too! My raw\r\nGauls at Clausentum had never treated me so.\r\n\r\n‘Then, quietly as a cloud, Maximus rode out of the fern (my Father behind\r\nhim), and reined up across the road. He wore the Purple, as though he were\r\nalready Emperor; his leggings were of white buckskin laced with gold.\r\n\r\n‘My men dropped like—like partridges.\r\n\r\n‘He said nothing for some time, only looked, with his eyes puckered. Then\r\nhe crooked his forefinger, and my men walked—crawled, I mean—to one side.\r\n\r\n‘“Stand in the sun, children,” he said, and they formed up on the hard\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n‘“What would you have done?” he said to me, “If I had not been here?”\r\n\r\n‘“I should have killed that man,” I answered.\r\n\r\n‘“Kill him now,” he said. “He will not move a limb.”\r\n\r\n‘“No,” I said. “You’ve taken my men out of my command. I should only be\r\nyour butcher if I killed him now.” Do you see what I meant?’ Parnesius\r\nturned to Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said Dan. ‘It wouldn’t have been fair, somehow.’\r\n\r\n‘That was what I thought,’ said Parnesius. ‘But Maximus frowned. “You’ll\r\nnever be an Emperor,” he said. “Not even a General will you be.”\r\n\r\n‘I was silent, but my Father seemed pleased.\r\n\r\n‘“I came here to see the last of you,” he said.\r\n\r\n‘“You have seen it,” said Maximus. “I shall never need your son any more.\r\nHe will live and he will die an officer of a Legion—and he might have been\r\nPrefect of one of my Provinces. Now eat and drink with us,” he said. “Your\r\nmen will wait till you have finished.”\r\n\r\n‘My miserable thirty stood like wine-skins glistening in the hot sun, and\r\nMaximus led us to where his people had set a meal. Himself he mixed the\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n‘“A year from now,” he said, “you will remember that you have sat with the\r\nEmperor of Britain—and Gaul.”\r\n\r\n‘“Yes,” said the Pater, “you can drive two mules—Gaul and Britain.”\r\n\r\n‘“Five years hence you will remember that you have drunk”—he passed me the\r\ncup and there was blue borage in it—“with the Emperor of Rome!”\r\n\r\n‘“No; you can’t drive three mules; they will tear you in pieces,” said my\r\nFather.\r\n\r\n‘“And you on the Wall, among the heather, will weep because your notion of\r\njustice was more to you than the favour of the Emperor of Rome.”\r\n\r\n‘I sat quite still. One does not answer a General who wears the Purple.\r\n\r\n‘“I am not angry with you,” he went on; “I owe too much to your Father——”\r\n\r\n‘“You owe me nothing but advice that you never took,” said the Pater.\r\n\r\n‘“——to be unjust to any of your family. Indeed, I say you will make a good\r\nofficer, but, so far as I am concerned, on the Wall you will live, and on\r\nthe Wall you will die,” said Maximus.\r\n\r\n‘“Very like,” said my Father. “But we shall have the Picts _and_ their\r\nfriends breaking through before long. You cannot move all troops out of\r\nBritain to make you Emperor, and expect the North to sit quiet.”\r\n\r\n‘“I follow my destiny,” said Maximus.\r\n\r\n‘“Follow it, then,” said my Father pulling up a fern root; “and die as\r\nTheodosius died.”\r\n\r\n‘“Ah!” said Maximus. “My old General was killed because he served the\r\nEmpire too well. _I_ may be killed, but not for that reason,” and he\r\nsmiled a little pale grey smile that made my blood run cold.\r\n\r\n‘“Then I had better follow my destiny,” I said, “and take my men to the\r\nWall.”\r\n\r\n‘He looked at me a long time, and bowed his head slanting like a Spaniard.\r\n“Follow it, boy,” he said. That was all. I was only too glad to get away,\r\nthough I had many messages for home. I found my men standing as they had\r\nbeen put—they had not even shifted their feet in the dust,—and off I\r\nmarched, still feeling that terrific smile like an east wind up my back. I\r\nnever halted them till sunset, and’—he turned about and looked at Pook’s\r\nHill below him—‘then I halted yonder.’ He pointed to the broken,\r\nbracken-covered shoulder of the Forge Hill behind old Hobden’s cottage.\r\n\r\n‘There? Why, that’s only the old Forge—where they made iron once,’ said\r\nDan.\r\n\r\n‘Very good stuff it was too,’ said Parnesius, calmly. ‘We mended three\r\nshoulder-straps here and had a spear-head riveted. The forge was rented\r\nfrom the Government by a one-eyed smith from Carthage. I remember we\r\ncalled him Cyclops. He sold me a beaver-skin rug for my sister’s room.’\r\n\r\n‘But it couldn’t have been here,’ Dan insisted.\r\n\r\n‘But it was! From the Altar of Victory at Anderida to the First Forge in\r\nthe Forest here is twelve miles seven hundred paces. It is all in the Road\r\nBook. A man doesn’t forget his first march. I think I could tell you every\r\nstation between this and——’ He leaned forward, but his eye was caught by\r\nthe setting sun.\r\n\r\nIt had come down to the top of Cherry Clack Hill, and the light poured in\r\nbetween the tree trunks so that you could see red and gold and black deep\r\ninto the heart of Far Wood; and Parnesius in his armour shone as though he\r\nhad been afire.\r\n\r\n‘Wait,’ he said, lifting a hand, and the sunlight jinked on his glass\r\nbracelet. ‘Wait! I pray to Mithras!’\r\n\r\nHe rose and stretched his arms westward, with deep, splendid-sounding\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nThen Puck began to sing too, in a voice like bells tolling, and as he sang\r\nhe slipped from ‘Volaterrae’ to the ground, and beckoned the children to\r\nfollow. They obeyed; it seemed as though the voices were pushing them\r\nalong; and through the goldy-brown light on the beech leaves they walked,\r\nwhile Puck between them chanted something like this:—\r\n\r\n  Cur mundus militat sub vana gloria\r\n  Cujus prosperitas est transitoria?\r\n  Tam cito labitur ejus potentia\r\n  Quam vasa figuli quæ sunt fragilia.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves at the little locked gates of the wood.\r\n\r\n  Quo Cæsar abiit celsus imperio?\r\n  Vel Dives splendidus totus in prandio?\r\n  Dic ubi Tullius——\r\n\r\nStill singing, he took Dan’s hand and wheeled him round to face Una as she\r\ncame out of the gate. It shut behind her, at the same time as Puck threw\r\nthe memory-magicking Oak, Ash, and Thorn leaves over their heads.\r\n\r\n‘Well, you _are_ jolly late,’ said Una. ‘Couldn’t you get away before?’\r\n\r\n‘I did,’ said Dan. ‘I got away in lots of time, but—but I didn’t know it\r\nwas so late. Where’ve you been?’\r\n\r\n‘In Volaterrae—waiting for you.’\r\n\r\n‘Sorry,’ said Dan. ‘It was all that beastly Latin.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BRITISH-ROMAN SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n        (A. D. 406)\r\n\r\n  _My father’s father saw it not,_\r\n    _And I, belike, shall never come,_\r\n  _To look on that so-holy spot—_\r\n            _The very Rome—_\r\n\r\n  _Crowned by all Time, all Art, all Might,_\r\n    _The equal work of Gods and Man—_\r\n  _City beneath whose oldest height_\r\n            _The Race began,—_\r\n\r\n  _Soon to send forth again a brood_\r\n    _Unshakeable, we pray, that clings,_\r\n  _To Rome’s thrice-hammered hardihood—_\r\n            _In arduous things._\r\n\r\n  _Strong heart with triple armour bound,_\r\n    _Beat strongly, for thy life-blood runs,_\r\n  _Age after Age, the Empire round—_\r\n            _In us thy Sons,_\r\n\r\n  _Who, distant from the Seven Hills,_\r\n    _Loving and serving much, require_\r\n  _Thee, Thee to guard ’gainst home-born ills,_\r\n            _The Imperial Fire!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE GREAT WALL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE GREAT WALL\r\n\r\n\r\n  When I left Rome for Lalage’s sake\r\n    By the Legions’ Road to Rimini,\r\n  She vowed her heart was mine to take\r\n    With me and my shield to Rimini—\r\n    (Till the Eagles flew from Rimini!)\r\n      And I’ve tramped Britain and I’ve tramped Gaul\r\n      And the Pontic shore where the snow-flakes fall\r\n    As white as the neck of Lalage—\r\n    As cold as the heart of Lalage!\r\n      And I’ve lost Britain and I’ve lost Gaul\r\n\r\n(the voice seemed very cheerful about it),\r\n\r\n      And I’ve lost Rome, and worst of all,\r\n        I’ve lost Lalage!\r\n\r\nThey were standing by the gate to Far Wood when they heard this song.\r\nWithout a word they hurried to their private gap and wriggled through the\r\nhedge almost atop of a jay that was feeding from Puck’s hand.\r\n\r\n‘Gently!’ said Puck. ‘What are you looking for?’\r\n\r\n‘Parnesius, of course,’ Dan answered. ‘We’ve only just remembered\r\nyesterday. It isn’t fair.’\r\n\r\nPuck chuckled as he rose. ‘I’m sorry, but children who spend the afternoon\r\nwith me and a Roman Centurion need a little settling dose of Magic before\r\nthey go to tea with their governess. Ohé, Parnesius!’ he called.\r\n\r\n‘Here, Faun!’ came the answer from ‘Volaterrae.’ They could see the\r\nshimmer of bronze armour in the beech crotch, and the friendly flash of\r\nthe great shield uplifted.\r\n\r\n‘I have driven out the Britons.’ Parnesius laughed like a boy. ‘I occupy\r\ntheir high forts. But Rome is merciful! You may come up.’ And up they\r\nthree all scrambled.\r\n\r\n‘What was the song you were singing just now?’ said Una, as soon as she\r\nhad settled herself.\r\n\r\n‘That? Oh, _Rimini_. It’s one of the tunes that are always being born\r\nsomewhere in the Empire. They run like a pestilence for six months or a\r\nyear, till another one pleases the Legions, and then they march to\r\n_that_.’\r\n\r\n‘Tell them about the marching, Parnesius. Few people nowadays walk from\r\nend to end of this country,’ said Puck.\r\n\r\n‘The greater their loss. I know nothing better than the Long March when\r\nyour feet are hardened. You begin after the mists have risen, and you end,\r\nperhaps, an hour after sundown.’\r\n\r\n‘And what do you have to eat?’ Dan asked, promptly.\r\n\r\n‘Fat bacon, beans, and bread, and whatever wine happens to be in the\r\nrest-houses. But soldiers are born grumblers. Their very first day out, my\r\nmen complained of our water-ground British corn. They said it wasn’t so\r\nfilling as the rough stuff that is ground in the Roman ox-mills. However,\r\nthey had to fetch and eat it.’\r\n\r\n‘Fetch it? Where from?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘From that newly-invented water-mill below the Forge.’\r\n\r\n‘That’s Forge Mill—_our_ Mill!’ Una looked at Puck.\r\n\r\n‘Yes; yours,’ Puck put in. ‘How old did you think it was?’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t know. Didn’t Sir Richard Dalyngridge talk about it?’\r\n\r\n‘He did, and it was old in his day,’ Puck answered. ‘Hundreds of years\r\nold.’\r\n\r\n‘It was new in mine,’ said Parnesius. ‘My men looked at the flour in their\r\nhelmets as though it had been a nest of adders. They did it to try my\r\npatience. But I—addressed them, and we became friends. To tell the truth,\r\nthey taught me the Roman Step. You see, I’d only served with\r\nquick-marching Auxiliaries. A Legion’s pace is altogether different. It is\r\na long, slow stride, that never varies from sunrise to sunset. “Rome’s\r\nRace—Rome’s Pace,” as the proverb says. Twenty-four miles in eight hours,\r\nneither more nor less. Head and spear up, shield on your back,\r\ncuirass-collar open one hand’s breadth—and that’s how you take the Eagles\r\nthrough Britain.’\r\n\r\n‘And did you meet any adventures?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘There are no adventures South the Wall,’ said Parnesius. ‘The worst thing\r\nthat happened me was having to appear before a magistrate up North, where\r\na wandering philosopher had jeered at the Eagles. I was able to show that\r\nthe old man had deliberately blocked our road, and the magistrate told\r\nhim, out of his own Book, I believe, that, whatever his God might be, he\r\nshould pay proper respect to Cæsar.’\r\n\r\n‘What did you do?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Went on. Why should _I_ care for such things, my business being to reach\r\nmy station? It took me twenty days.\r\n\r\n‘Of course, the farther North you go the emptier are the roads. At last\r\nyou fetch clear of the forests and climb bare hills, where wolves howl in\r\nthe ruins of our cities that have been. No more pretty girls; no more\r\njolly magistrates who knew your Father when he was young, and invite you\r\nto stay with them; no news at the temples and way-stations except bad news\r\nof wild beasts. There’s where you meet hunters, and trappers for the\r\nCircuses, prodding along chained bears and muzzled wolves. Your pony shies\r\nat them, and your men laugh.\r\n\r\n‘The houses change from gardened villas to shut forts with watch-towers of\r\ngrey stone, and great stone-walled sheepfolds, guarded by armed Britons of\r\nthe North Shore. In the naked hills beyond the naked houses, where the\r\nshadows of the clouds play like cavalry charging, you see puffs of black\r\nsmoke from the mines. The hard road goes on and on—and the wind sings\r\nthrough your helmet-plume—past altars to Legions and Generals forgotten,\r\nand broken statues of Gods and Heroes, and thousands of graves where the\r\nmountain foxes and hares peep at you. Red-hot in summer, freezing in\r\nwinter, is that big, purple heather country of broken stone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ‘There’s where you meet hunters, and trappers for the\r\n  Circuses, prodding along chained bears and muzzled wolves.’]\r\n\r\n‘Just when you think you are at the world’s end, you see a smoke from East\r\nto West as far as the eye can turn, and then, under it, also as far as the\r\neye can stretch, houses and temples, shops and theatres, barracks, and\r\ngranaries, trickling along like dice behind—always behind—one long, low,\r\nrising and falling, and hiding and showing line of towers. And that is the\r\nWall!’\r\n\r\n‘Ah!’ said the children, taking breath.\r\n\r\n‘You may well,’ said Parnesius. ‘Old men who have followed the Eagles\r\nsince boyhood say nothing in the Empire is more wonderful than first sight\r\nof the Wall!’\r\n\r\n‘Is it just a Wall? Like the one round the kitchen-garden?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘No, no! It is _the_ Wall. Along the top are towers with guard-houses,\r\nsmall towers, between. Even on the narrowest part of it three men with\r\nshields can walk abreast from guard-house to guard-house. A little curtain\r\nwall, no higher than a man’s neck, runs along the top of the thick wall,\r\nso that from a distance you see the helmets of the sentries sliding back\r\nand forth like beads. Thirty feet high is the Wall, and on the Picts’\r\nside, the North, is a ditch, strewn with blades of old swords and\r\nspear-heads set in wood, and tyres of wheels joined by chains. The Little\r\nPeople come there to steal iron for their arrow-heads.\r\n\r\n‘But the Wall itself is not more wonderful than the town behind it. Long\r\nago there were great ramparts and ditches on the South side, and no one\r\nwas allowed to build there. Now the ramparts are partly pulled down and\r\nbuilt over, from end to end of the Wall; making a thin town eighty miles\r\nlong. Think of it! One roaring, rioting, cockfighting, wolf-baiting,\r\nhorse-racing town, from Ituna on the West to Segedunum on the cold eastern\r\nbeach! On one side heather, woods and ruins where Picts hide, and on the\r\nother, a vast town—long like a snake, and wicked like a snake. Yes, a\r\nsnake basking beside a warm wall!\r\n\r\n‘My Cohort, I was told, lay at Hunno, where the Great North Road runs\r\nthrough the Wall into the Province of Valentia.’ Parnesius laughed\r\nscornfully. ‘The Province of Valentia! We followed the road, therefore,\r\ninto Hunno town, and stood astonished. The place was a fair—a fair of\r\npeoples from every corner of the Empire. Some were racing horses: some sat\r\nin wine-shops: some watched dogs baiting bears, and many gathered in a\r\nditch to see cocks fight. A boy not much older than myself, but I could\r\nsee he was an Officer, reined up before me and asked what I wanted.\r\n\r\n‘“My station,” I said, and showed him my shield.’ Parnesius held up his\r\nbroad shield with its three X’s like letters on a beer-cask.\r\n\r\n‘“Lucky omen!” said he. “Your Cohort’s the next tower to us, but they’re\r\nall at the cock-fight. This is a happy place. Come and wet the Eagles.” He\r\nmeant to offer me a drink.\r\n\r\n‘“When I’ve handed over my men,” I said. I felt angry and ashamed.\r\n\r\n‘“Oh, you’ll soon outgrow that sort of nonsense,” he answered. “But don’t\r\nlet me interfere with your hopes. Go on to the Statue of Roma Dea. You\r\ncan’t miss it. The main road into Valentia!” and he laughed and rode off.\r\nI could see the Statue not a quarter of a mile away, and there I went. At\r\nsome time or other the Great North Road ran under it into Valentia; but\r\nthe far end had been blocked up because of the Picts, and on the plaster a\r\nman had scratched, “Finish!” It was like marching into a cave. We grounded\r\nspears together, my little thirty, and it echoed in the barrel of the\r\narch, but none came. There was a door at one side painted with our number.\r\nWe prowled in, and I found a cook asleep, and ordered him to give us food.\r\nThen I climbed to the top of the Wall, and looked out over the Pict\r\ncountry, and I—thought,’ said Parnesius. ‘The bricked-up arch with\r\n“Finish!” on the plaster was what shook me, for I was not much more than a\r\nboy.’\r\n\r\n‘What a shame!’ said Una. ‘But did you feel happy after you’d had a\r\ngood——’ Dan stopped her with a nudge.\r\n\r\n‘Happy?’ said Parnesius. ‘When the men of the Cohort I was to command came\r\nback unhelmeted from the cock-fight, their birds under their arms, and\r\nasked me who I was? No, I was not happy; but I made my new Cohort unhappy\r\ntoo.... I wrote my Mother I was happy, but, oh, my friends’—he stretched\r\narms over bare knees—‘I would not wish my worst enemy to suffer as I\r\nsuffered through my first months on the Wall. Remember this: among the\r\nofficers was scarcely one, except myself (and I thought I had lost the\r\nfavour of Maximus, my General), scarcely one who had not done something of\r\nwrong or folly. Either he had killed a man, or taken money, or insulted\r\nthe magistrates, or blasphemed the Gods, and so had been sent to the Wall\r\nas a hiding-place from shame or fear. And the men were as the officers.\r\nRemember, also, that the Wall was manned by every breed and race in the\r\nEmpire. No two towers spoke the same tongue, or worshipped the same Gods.\r\nIn one thing only we were all equal. No matter what arms we had used\r\nbefore we came to the Wall, _on_ the Wall we were all archers, like the\r\nScythians. The Pict cannot run away from the arrow, or crawl under it. He\r\nis a bowman himself. _He_ knows!’\r\n\r\n‘I suppose you were fighting Picts all the time,’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Picts seldom fight. I never saw a fighting Pict for half a year. The tame\r\nPicts told us they had all gone North.’\r\n\r\n‘What is a tame Pict?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘A Pict—there were many such—who speaks a few words of our tongue, and\r\nslips across the Wall to sell ponies and wolf-hounds. Without a horse and\r\na dog, _and_ a friend, man would perish. The Gods gave me all three, and\r\nthere is no gift like friendship. Remember this’—Parnesius turned to\r\nDan—‘when you become a young man. For your fate will turn on the first\r\ntrue friend you make.’\r\n\r\n‘He means,’ said Puck, grinning, ‘that if you try to make yourself a\r\ndecent chap when you’re young, you’ll make rather decent friends when you\r\ngrow up. If you’re a beast, you’ll have beastly friends. Listen to the\r\nPious Parnesius on Friendship!’\r\n\r\n‘I am not pious,’ Parnesius answered, ‘but I know what goodness means; and\r\nmy friend, though he was without hope, was ten thousand times better than\r\nI. Stop laughing, Faun!’\r\n\r\n‘Oh Youth Eternal and All-believing,’ cried Puck, as he rocked on the\r\nbranch above. ‘Tell them about your Pertinax.’\r\n\r\n‘He was that friend the Gods sent me—the boy who spoke to me when I first\r\ncame. Little older than myself, commanding the Augusta Victoria Cohort on\r\nthe tower next to us and the Numidians. In virtue he was far my superior.’\r\n\r\n‘Then why was he on the Wall?’ Una asked, quickly. ‘They’d all done\r\nsomething bad. You said so yourself.’\r\n\r\n‘He was the nephew, his Father had died, of a great rich man in Gaul who\r\nwas not always kind to his Mother. When Pertinax grew up, he discovered\r\nthis, and so his uncle shipped him off, by trickery and force, to the\r\nWall. We came to know each other at a ceremony in our Temple—in the dark.\r\nIt was the Bull Killing,’ Parnesius explained to Puck.\r\n\r\n‘_I_ see,’ said Puck, and turned to the children. ‘That’s something you\r\nwouldn’t quite understand. Parnesius means he met Pertinax in church.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes—in the Cave we first met, and we were both raised to the Degree of\r\nGryphons together.’ Parnesius lifted his hand towards his neck for an\r\ninstant. ‘He had been on the Wall two years, and knew the Picts well. He\r\ntaught me first how to take Heather.’\r\n\r\n‘What’s that?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Going out hunting in the Pict country with a tame Pict. You are quite\r\nsafe so long as you are his guest, and wear a sprig of heather where it\r\ncan be seen. If you went alone you would surely be killed, if you were not\r\nsmothered first in the bogs. Only the Picts know their way about those\r\nblack and hidden bogs. Old Allo, the one-eyed, withered little Pict from\r\nwhom we bought our ponies, was our special friend. At first we went only\r\nto escape from the terrible town, and to talk together about our homes.\r\nThen he showed us how to hunt wolves and those great red deer with horns\r\nlike Jewish candlesticks. The Roman-born officers rather looked down on us\r\nfor doing this, but we preferred the heather to their amusements. Believe\r\nme,’ Parnesius turned again to Dan, ‘a boy is safe from all things that\r\nreally harm when he is astride a pony or after a deer. Do you remember, O\r\nFaun,’ he turned to Puck, ‘the little altar I built to the Sylvan Pan by\r\nthe pine-forest beyond the brook?’\r\n\r\n‘Which? The stone one with the line from Xenophon?’ said Puck, in quite a\r\nnew voice.\r\n\r\n‘No. What do _I_ know of Xenophon? That was Pertinax—after he had shot his\r\nfirst mountain-hare with an arrow—by chance! Mine I made of round pebbles\r\nin memory of my first bear. It took me one happy day to build.’ Parnesius\r\nfaced the children quickly.\r\n\r\n‘And that was how we lived on the Wall for two years—a little scuffling\r\nwith the Picts, and a great deal of hunting with old Allo in the Pict\r\ncountry. He called us his children sometimes, and we were fond of him and\r\nhis barbarians, though we never let them paint us Pict fashion. The marks\r\nendure till you die.’\r\n\r\n‘How’s it done?’ said Dan. ‘Anything like tattooing?’\r\n\r\n‘They prick the skin till the blood runs, and rub in coloured juices. Allo\r\nwas painted blue, green, and red from his forehead to his ankles. He said\r\nit was part of his religion. He told us about his religion (Pertinax was\r\nalways interested in such things), and as we came to know him well, he\r\ntold us what was happening in Britain behind the Wall. Many things took\r\nplace behind us in those days. And, by the Light of the Sun,’ said\r\nParnesius, earnestly, ‘there was not much that those little people did not\r\nknow! He told me when Maximus crossed over to Gaul, after he had made\r\nhimself Emperor of Britain, and what troops and emigrants he had taken\r\nwith him. _We_ did not get the news on the Wall till fifteen days later.\r\nHe told me what troops Maximus was taking out of Britain every month to\r\nhelp him to conquer Gaul; and I always found the numbers as he said.\r\nWonderful! And I tell another strange thing!’\r\n\r\nHe jointed his hands across his knees, and leaned his head on the curve of\r\nthe shield behind him.\r\n\r\n‘Late in the summer, when the first frosts begin and the Picts kill their\r\nbees, we three rode out after wolf with some new hounds. Rutilianus, our\r\nGeneral, had given us ten days’ leave, and we had pushed beyond the Second\r\nWall—beyond the Province of Valentia—into the higher hills, where there\r\nare not even any of Rome’s old ruins. We killed a she-wolf before noon,\r\nand while Allo was skinning her he looked up and said to me, “When you are\r\nCaptain of the Wall, my child, you won’t be able to do this any more!”\r\n\r\n‘I might as well have been made Prefect of Lower Gaul, so I laughed and\r\nsaid, “Wait till I am Captain.” “No, don’t wait,” said Allo. “Take my\r\nadvice and go home—both of you.” “We have no homes,” said Pertinax. “You\r\nknow that as well as we do. We’re finished men—thumbs down against both of\r\nus. Only men without hope would risk their necks on your ponies.” The old\r\nman laughed one of those short Pict laughs—like a fox barking on a frosty\r\nnight. “I’m fond of you two,” he said. “Besides, I’ve taught you what\r\nlittle you know about hunting. Take my advice and go home.”\r\n\r\n‘“We can’t,” I said. “I’m out of favour with my General, for one thing;\r\nand for another, Pertinax has an uncle.”\r\n\r\n‘“I don’t know about his uncle,” said Allo, “but the trouble with you,\r\nParnesius, is that your General thinks well of you.”\r\n\r\n‘“Roma Dea!” said Pertinax, sitting up. “What can you guess what Maximus\r\nthinks, you old horse-coper?”\r\n\r\n‘Just then (you know how near the brutes creep when one is eating?) a\r\ngreat dog-wolf jumped out behind us, and away our rested hounds tore after\r\nhim, with us at their tails. He ran us far out of any country we’d ever\r\nheard of, straight as an arrow till sunset, towards the sunset. We came at\r\nlast to long capes stretching into winding waters, and on a grey beach\r\nbelow us we saw ships drawn up. Forty-seven we counted—not Roman galleys\r\nbut the raven-winged ships from the North where Rome does not rule. Men\r\nmoved in the ships, and the sun flashed on their helmets—winged helmets of\r\nthe red-haired men from the North where Rome does not rule. We watched,\r\nand we counted, and we wondered; for though we had heard rumours\r\nconcerning these Winged Hats, as the Picts called them, never before had\r\nwe looked upon them.\r\n\r\n‘“Come away! Come away!” said Allo. “My Heather won’t protect you here. We\r\nshall all be killed!” His legs trembled like his voice. Back we went—back\r\nacross the heather under the moon, till it was nearly morning, and our\r\npoor beasts stumbled on some ruins.\r\n\r\n‘When we woke, very stiff and cold, Allo was mixing the meal and water.\r\nOne does not light fires in the Pict country except near a village. The\r\nlittle men are always signalling to each other with smokes, and a strange\r\nsmoke brings them out buzzing like bees. They can sting, too!\r\n\r\n‘“What we saw last night was a trading-station,” said Allo. “Nothing but a\r\ntrading-station.”\r\n\r\n‘“I do not like lies on an empty stomach,” said Pertinax. “I suppose” (he\r\nhad eyes like an eagle’s), “I suppose _that_ is a trading-station also?”\r\nHe pointed to a smoke far off on a hill-top, ascending in what we call the\r\nPict’s Call:—Puff—double-puff: double-puff—puff! They make it by raising\r\nand dropping a wet hide on a fire.\r\n\r\n‘“No,” said Allo, pushing the platter back into the bag. “That is for you\r\nand me. Your fate is fixed. Come.”\r\n\r\n‘We came. When one takes Heather, one must obey one’s Pict—but that\r\nwretched smoke was twenty miles distant, well over on the east coast, and\r\nthe day was as hot as a bath.\r\n\r\n‘“Whatever happens,” said Allo, while our ponies grunted along, “I want\r\nyou to remember me.”\r\n\r\n‘“I shall not forget,” said Pertinax. “You have cheated me out of my\r\nbreakfast.”\r\n\r\n‘“What is a handful of crushed oats to a Roman?” he said. Then he laughed\r\nhis laugh that was not a laugh. “What would you do if you were a handful\r\nof oats being crushed between the upper and lower stones of a mill?”\r\n\r\n‘“I’m Pertinax, not a riddle-guesser,” said Pertinax.\r\n\r\n‘“You’re a fool,” said Allo. “Your Gods and my Gods are threatened by\r\nstrange Gods, and all you can do is to laugh.”\r\n\r\n‘“Threatened men live long,” I said.\r\n\r\n‘“I pray the Gods that may be true,” he said. “But I ask you again not to\r\nforget me.”\r\n\r\n‘We climbed the last hot hill and looked out on the eastern sea, three or\r\nfour miles off. There was a small sailing-galley of the North Gaul pattern\r\nat anchor, her landing-plank down and her sail half up; and below us,\r\nalone in a hollow, holding his pony, sat Maximus, Emperor of Britain! He\r\nwas dressed like a hunter, and he leaned on his little stick; but I knew\r\nthat back as far as I could see it, and I told Pertinax.\r\n\r\n‘“You’re madder than Allo!” he said. “It must be the sun!”\r\n\r\n‘Maximus never stirred till we stood before him. Then he looked me up and\r\ndown, and said: “Hungry again? It seems to be my destiny to feed you\r\nwhenever we meet. I have food here. Allo shall cook it.”\r\n\r\n‘“No,” said Allo. “A Prince in his own land does not wait on wandering\r\nEmperors. I feed my two children without asking your leave.” He began to\r\nblow up the ashes.\r\n\r\n‘“I was wrong,” said Pertinax. “We are all mad. Speak up, O Madman called\r\nEmperor!”\r\n\r\n‘Maximus smiled his terrible tight-lipped smile, but two years on the Wall\r\ndo not make a man afraid of mere looks. So I was not afraid.\r\n\r\n‘“I meant you, Parnesius, to live and die an Officer of the Wall,” said\r\nMaximus. “But it seems from these,” he fumbled in his breast, “you can\r\nthink as well as draw.” He pulled out a roll of letters I had written to\r\nmy people, full of drawings of Picts, and bears, and men I had met on the\r\nWall. Mother and my sister always liked my pictures.\r\n\r\n‘He handed me one that I had called “Maximus’s Soldiers.” It showed a row\r\nof fat wine-skins, and our old Doctor of the Hunno hospital snuffing at\r\nthem. Each time that Maximus had taken troops out of Britain to help him\r\nto conquer Gaul, he used to send the garrisons more wine—to keep them\r\nquiet, I suppose. On the Wall, we always called a wine-skin a “Maximus.”\r\nOh, yes; and I had drawn them in Imperial helmets!\r\n\r\n‘“Not long since,” he went on, “men’s names were sent up to Cæsar for\r\nsmaller jokes than this.”\r\n\r\n‘“True, Cæsar,” said Pertinax; “but you forget that was before I, your\r\nfriend’s friend, became such a good spear-thrower.”\r\n\r\n‘He did not actually point his hunting spear at Maximus, but balanced it\r\non his palm—so!\r\n\r\n‘“I was speaking of time past,” said Maximus, never fluttering an eyelid.\r\n“Nowadays one is only too pleased to find boys who can think for\r\nthemselves, _and_ their friends.” He nodded at Pertinax. “Your Father lent\r\nme the letters, Parnesius, so you run no risk from me.”\r\n\r\n‘“None whatever,” said Pertinax, and rubbed the spear-point on his sleeve.\r\n\r\n‘“I have been forced to reduce the garrisons in Britain, because I need\r\ntroops in Gaul. Now I come to take troops from the Wall itself,” said he.\r\n\r\n‘“I wish you joy of us,” said Pertinax. “We’re the last sweepings of the\r\nEmpire—the men without hope. Myself, I’d sooner trust condemned\r\ncriminals.”\r\n\r\n‘“You think so?” he said, quite seriously. “But it will only be till I win\r\nGaul. One must always risk one’s life, or one’s soul, or one’s peace—or\r\nsome little thing.”\r\n\r\n‘Allo passed round the fire with the sizzling deer’s meat. He served us\r\ntwo first.\r\n\r\n‘“Ah!” said Maximus, waiting his turn. “I perceive you are in your own\r\ncountry. Well, you deserve it. They tell me you have quite a following\r\namong the Picts, Parnesius.”\r\n\r\n‘“I have hunted with them,” I said. “Maybe I have a few friends among the\r\nHeather.”\r\n\r\n‘“He is the only armoured man of you all who understands us,” said Allo,\r\nand he began a long speech about our virtues, and how we had saved one of\r\nhis grandchildren from a wolf the year before.’\r\n\r\n‘Had you?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Yes; but that was neither here nor there. The little green man orated\r\nlike a—like Cicero. He made us out to be magnificent fellows. Maximus\r\nnever took his eyes off our faces.\r\n\r\n‘“Enough,” he said. “I have heard Allo on you. I wish to hear you on the\r\nPicts.”\r\n\r\n‘I told him as much as I knew, and Pertinax helped me out. There is never\r\nharm in a Pict if you but take the trouble to find out what he wants.\r\nTheir real grievance against us came from our burning their heather. The\r\nwhole garrison of the Wall moved out twice a year, and solemnly burned the\r\nheather for ten miles North. Rutilianus, our General, called it clearing\r\nthe country. The Picts, of course, scampered away, and all we did was to\r\ndestroy their bee-bloom in the summer, and ruin their sheep-food in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n‘“True, quite true,” said Allo. “How can we make our holy heather-wine, if\r\nyou burn our bee-pasture?”\r\n\r\n‘We talked long, Maximus asking keen questions that showed he knew much\r\nand had thought more about the Picts. He said presently to me: “If I gave\r\nyou the old Province of Valentia to govern, could you keep the Picts\r\ncontented till I won Gaul? Stand away, so that you do not see Allo’s face;\r\nand speak your own thoughts.”\r\n\r\n‘“No,” I said. “You cannot re-make that Province. The Picts have been free\r\ntoo long.”\r\n\r\n‘“Leave them their village councils, and let them furnish their own\r\nsoldiers,” he said. “You, I am sure, would hold the reins very lightly.”\r\n\r\n‘“Even then, no,” I said. “At least not now. They have been too oppressed\r\nby us to trust anything with a Roman name for years and years.”\r\n\r\n‘I heard old Allo behind me mutter: “Good child!”\r\n\r\n‘“Then what do you recommend,” said Maximus, “to keep the North quiet till\r\nI win Gaul?”\r\n\r\n‘“Leave the Picts alone,” I said. “Stop the heather-burning at once,\r\nand—they are improvident little animals—send them a shipload or two of\r\ncorn now and then.”\r\n\r\n‘“Their own men must distribute it—not some cheating Greek accountant,”\r\nsaid Pertinax.\r\n\r\n‘“Yes, and allow them to come to our hospitals when they are sick,” I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n‘“Surely they would die first,” said Maximus.\r\n\r\n‘“Not if Parnesius brought them in,” said Allo. “I could show you twenty\r\nwolf-bitten, bear-clawed Picts within twenty miles of here. But Parnesius\r\nmust stay with them in Hospital, else they would go mad with fear.”\r\n\r\n‘“_I_ see,” said Maximus. “Like everything else in the world, it is one\r\nman’s work. You, I think, are that one man.”\r\n\r\n‘“Pertinax and I are one,” I said.\r\n\r\n‘“As you please, so long as you work. Now, Allo, you know that I mean your\r\npeople no harm. Leave us to talk together,” said Maximus.\r\n\r\n‘“No need!” said Allo. “I am the corn between the upper and lower\r\nmillstones. I must know what the lower millstone means to do. These boys\r\nhave spoken the truth as far as they know it. I, a Prince, will tell you\r\nthe rest. I am troubled about the Men of the North.” He squatted like a\r\nhare in the heather, and looked over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n‘“I also,” said Maximus, “or I should not be here.”\r\n\r\n‘“Listen,” said Allo. “Long and long ago the Winged Hats”—he meant the\r\nNorthmen—“came to our beaches and said, ‘Rome falls! Push her down!’ We\r\nfought you. You sent men. We were beaten. After that we said to the Winged\r\nHats, ‘You are liars! Make our men alive that Rome killed, and we will\r\nbelieve you.’ They went away ashamed. Now they come back bold, and they\r\ntell the old tale, which we begin to believe—that Rome falls!”\r\n\r\n‘“Give me three years’ peace on the Wall,” cried Maximus, “and I will show\r\nyou and all the ravens how they lie!”\r\n\r\n‘“Ah, I wish it too! I wish to save what is left of the corn from the\r\nmillstones. But you shoot us Picts when we come to borrow a little iron\r\nfrom the Iron Ditch; you burn our heather, which is all our crop; you\r\ntrouble us with your great catapults. Then you hide behind the Wall, and\r\nscorch us with Greek fire. How can I keep my young men from listening to\r\nthe Winged Hats—in winter especially, when we are hungry? My young men\r\nwill say, ‘Rome can neither fight nor rule. She is taking her men out of\r\nBritain. The Winged Hats will help us to push down the Wall. Let us show\r\nthem the secret roads across the bogs.’ Do _I_ want that? No!” He spat\r\nlike an adder. “_I_ would keep the secrets of my people though I were\r\nburned alive. My two children here have spoken truth. Leave us Picts\r\nalone. Comfort us, and cherish us, and feed us from far off—with the hand\r\nbehind your back. Parnesius understands us. Let _him_ have rule on the\r\nWall, and I will hold my young men quiet for”—he ticked it off on his\r\nfingers—“one year easily: the next year not so easily: the third year,\r\nperhaps! See, I give you three years. If then you do not show us that Rome\r\nis strong in men and terrible in arms, the Winged Hats, I tell you, will\r\nsweep down the Wall from either sea till they meet in the middle, and you\r\nwill go. _I_ shall not grieve over that, but well I know tribe never helps\r\ntribe except for one price. We Picts will go too. The Winged Hats will\r\ngrind us to this!” He tossed a handful of dust in the air.\r\n\r\n‘“Oh, Roma Dea!” said Maximus, half aloud. “It is always one man’s\r\nwork—always and everywhere!”\r\n\r\n‘“And one man’s life,” said Allo. “You are Emperor, but not a God. You may\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n‘“I have thought of that, too,” said he. “Very good. If this wind holds, I\r\nshall be at the East end of the Wall by morning. To-morrow, then, I shall\r\nsee you two when I inspect; and I will make you Captains of the Wall for\r\nthis work.”\r\n\r\n‘“One instant, Cæsar,” said Pertinax. “All men have their price. I am not\r\nbought yet.”\r\n\r\n‘“Do _you_ also begin to bargain so early?” said Maximus. “Well?”\r\n\r\n‘“Give me justice against my uncle Icenus, the Duumvir of Divio in Gaul,”\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n‘“Only a life? I thought it would be money or an office. Certainly you\r\nshall have him. Write his name on these tablets—on the red side; the other\r\nis for the living!” And Maximus held out his tablets.\r\n\r\n‘“He is of no use to me dead,” said Pertinax. “My mother is a widow. I am\r\nfar off. I am not sure he pays her all her dowry.”\r\n\r\n‘“No matter. My arm is reasonably long. We will look through your uncle’s\r\naccounts in due time. Now, farewell till to-morrow, O Captains of the\r\nWall!”\r\n\r\n‘We saw him grow small across the heather as he walked to the galley.\r\nThere were Picts, scores, each side of him, hidden behind stones. He never\r\nlooked left or right. He sailed away Southerly, full spread before the\r\nevening breeze, and when we had watched him out to sea, we were silent. We\r\nunderstood Earth bred few men like to this man.\r\n\r\n‘Presently Allo brought the ponies and held them for us to mount—a thing\r\nhe had never done before.\r\n\r\n‘“Wait awhile,” said Pertinax, and he made a little altar of cut turf, and\r\nstrewed heather-bloom atop, and laid upon it a letter from a girl in Gaul.\r\n\r\n‘“What do you do, O my friend?” I said.\r\n\r\n‘“I sacrifice to my dead youth,” he answered, and, when the flames had\r\nconsumed the letter, he ground them out with his heel. Then we rode back\r\nto that Wall of which we were to be Captains.’\r\n\r\nParnesius stopped. The children sat still, not even asking if that were\r\nall the tale. Puck beckoned, and pointed the way out of the wood. ‘Sorry,’\r\nhe whispered, ‘but you must go now.’\r\n\r\n‘We haven’t made him angry, have we?’ said Una. ‘He looks so far off,\r\nand—and—thinky.’\r\n\r\n‘Bless your heart, no. Wait till to-morrow. It won’t be long. Remember,\r\nyou’ve been playing “_Lays of Ancient Rome_.”’\r\n\r\nAnd as soon as they had scrambled through their gap, where Oak, Ash and\r\nThorn grow, that was all they remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SONG TO MITHRAS\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mithras, God of the Morning, our trumpets waken the Wall!_\r\n  _‘Rome is above the Nations, but Thou art over all!’_\r\n  _Now as the names are answered and the guards are marched away,_\r\n  _Mithras, also a soldier, give us strength for the day!_\r\n\r\n  _Mithras, God of the Noontide, the heather swims in the heat,_\r\n  _Our helmets scorch our foreheads; our sandals burn our feet!_\r\n  _Now in the ungirt hour; now ere we blink and drowse,_\r\n  _Mithras, also a soldier, keep us true to our vows!_\r\n\r\n  _Mithras, God of the Sunset, low on the Western main,_\r\n  _Thou descending immortal, immortal to rise again!_\r\n  _Now when the watch is ended, now when the wine is drawn,_\r\n  _Mithras, also a soldier, keep us pure till the dawn!_\r\n\r\n  _Mithras, God of the Midnight, here where the great bull lies,_\r\n  _Look on thy children in darkness. Oh take our sacrifice!_\r\n  _Many roads Thou hast fashioned: all of them lead to the Light,_\r\n  _Mithras, also a soldier, teach us to die aright!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINGED HATS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINGED HATS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day happened to be what they called a Wild Afternoon. Father and\r\nMother went out to pay calls; Miss Blake went for a ride on her bicycle,\r\nand they were left all alone till eight o’clock.\r\n\r\nWhen they had seen their dear parents and their dear preceptress politely\r\noff the premises they got a cabbage-leaf full of raspberries from the\r\ngardener, and a Wild Tea from Ellen. They ate the raspberries to prevent\r\ntheir squashing, and they meant to divide the cabbage-leaf with Three Cows\r\ndown at the Theatre, but they came across a dead hedgehog which they\r\nsimply _had_ to bury, and the leaf was too useful to waste.\r\n\r\nThen they went on to the Forge and found old Hobden the hedger at home\r\nwith his son the Bee Boy who is not quite right in his head, but who can\r\npick up swarms of bees in his naked hands; and the Bee Boy told them the\r\nrhyme about the slow-worm:—\r\n\r\n  ‘If I had eyes _as_ I could see,\r\n  No mortal man would trouble me.’\r\n\r\nThey all had tea together by the hives, and Hobden said the loaf-cake\r\nwhich Ellen had given them was almost as good as what his wife used to\r\nmake, and he showed them how to set a wire at the right height for hares.\r\nThey knew about rabbits already.\r\n\r\nThen they climbed up Long Ditch into the lower end of Far Wood. This is\r\nsadder and darker than the ‘Volaterrae’ end because of an old marlpit full\r\nof black water, where weepy, hairy moss hangs round the stumps of the\r\nwillows and alders. But the birds come to perch on the dead branches, and\r\nHobden says that the bitter willow-water is a sort of medicine for sick\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThey sat down on a felled oak-trunk in the shadows of the beech\r\nundergrowth, and were looping the wires Hobden had given them, when they\r\nsaw Parnesius.\r\n\r\n‘How quietly you came!’ said Una, moving up to make room. ‘Where’s Puck?’\r\n\r\n‘The Faun and I have disputed whether it is better that I should tell you\r\nall my tale, or leave it untold,’ he replied.\r\n\r\n‘I only said that if he told it as it happened you wouldn’t understand\r\nit,’ said Puck, jumping up like a squirrel from behind the log.\r\n\r\n‘I don’t understand all of it,’ said Una, ‘but I like hearing about the\r\nlittle Picts.’\r\n\r\n‘What _I_ can’t understand,’ said Dan, ‘is how Maximus knew all about the\r\nPicts when he was over in Gaul.’\r\n\r\n‘He who makes himself Emperor anywhere must know everything, everywhere,’\r\nsaid Parnesius. ‘We had this much from Maximus’ mouth after the Games.’\r\n\r\n‘Games? What games?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\nParnesius stretched his arm out stiffly, thumb pointed to the ground.\r\n‘Gladiators! _That_ sort of game,’ he said. ‘There were two days’ Games in\r\nhis honour when he landed all unexpected at Segedunum on the East end of\r\nthe Wall. Yes, the day after we had met him we held two days’ games; but I\r\nthink the greatest risk was run, not by the poor wretches on the sand, but\r\nby Maximus. In the old days the Legions kept silence before their Emperor.\r\nSo did not we! You could hear the solid roar run West along the Wall as\r\nhis chair was carried rocking through the crowds. The garrison beat round\r\nhim—clamouring, clowning, asking for pay, for change of quarters, for\r\nanything that came into their wild heads. That chair was like a little\r\nboat among waves, dipping and falling, but always rising again after one\r\nhad shut the eyes.’ Parnesius shivered.\r\n\r\n‘Were they angry with him?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘No more angry than wolves in a cage when their trainer walks among them.\r\nIf he had turned his back an instant, or for an instant had ceased to hold\r\ntheir eyes, there would have been another Emperor made on the Wall that\r\nhour. Was it not so, Faun?’\r\n\r\n‘So it was. So it always will be,’ said Puck.\r\n\r\n‘Late in the evening his messenger came for us, and we followed to the\r\nTemple of Victory, where he lodged with Rutilianus, the General of the\r\nWall. I had hardly seen the General before, but he always gave me leave\r\nwhen I wished to take Heather. He was a great glutton, and kept five Asian\r\ncooks, and he came of a family that believed in oracles. We could smell\r\nhis good dinner when we entered, but the tables were empty. He lay\r\nsnorting on a couch. Maximus sat apart among long rolls of accounts. Then\r\nthe doors were shut.\r\n\r\n‘“These are your men,” said Maximus to the General, who propped his\r\neye-corners open with his gouty fingers, and stared at us like a fish.\r\n\r\n‘“I shall know them again, Cæsar,” said Rutilianus.\r\n\r\n‘“Very good,” said Maximus. “Now hear! You are not to move man or shield\r\non the Wall except as these boys shall tell you. You will do nothing,\r\nexcept eat, without their permission. They are the head and arms. You are\r\nthe belly!”\r\n\r\n‘“As Cæsar pleases,” the old man grunted. “If my pay and profits are not\r\ncut, you may make my Ancestors’ Oracle my master. Rome has been! Rome has\r\nbeen!” Then he turned on his side to sleep.\r\n\r\n‘“He has it,” said Maximus. “We will get to what _I_ need.”\r\n\r\n‘He unrolled full copies of the number of men and supplies on the\r\nWall—down to the sick that very day in Hunno Hospital. Oh, but I groaned\r\nwhen his pen marked off detachment after detachment of our best—of our\r\nleast worthless men! He took two towers of our Scythians, two of our North\r\nBritish auxiliaries, two Numidian cohorts, the Dacians all, and half the\r\nBelgians. It was like an eagle pecking a carcass.\r\n\r\n‘“And now, how many catapults have you?” He turned up a new list, but\r\nPertinax laid his open hand there.\r\n\r\n‘“No, Cæsar,” said he. “Do not tempt the Gods too far. Take men, or\r\nengines, but not both; else we refuse.”’\r\n\r\n‘Engines?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘The catapults of the Wall—huge things forty feet high to the head—firing\r\nnets of raw stone or forged bolts. Nothing can stand against them. He left\r\nus our catapults at last, but he took a Cæsar’s half of our men without\r\npity. We were a shell when he rolled up the lists!\r\n\r\n‘“Hail, Cæsar! We, about to die, salute you!” said Pertinax, laughing. “If\r\nany enemy even leans against the Wall now, it will tumble.”\r\n\r\n‘“Give me the three years Allo spoke of,” he answered, “and you shall have\r\ntwenty thousand men of your own choosing up here. But now it is a gamble—a\r\ngame played against the Gods, and the stakes are Britain, Gaul, and\r\nperhaps, Rome. You play on my side?”\r\n\r\n‘“We will play, Cæsar,” I said for I had never met a man like this man.\r\n\r\n‘“Good. To-morrow,” said he, “I proclaim you Captains of the Wall before\r\nthe troops.”\r\n\r\n‘So we went into the moonlight, where they were cleaning the ground after\r\nthe Games. We saw great Roma Dea atop of the Wall, the frost on her\r\nhelmet, and her spear pointed towards the North Star. We saw the twinkle\r\nof night-fires all along the guard-towers, and the line of the black\r\ncatapults growing smaller and smaller in the distance. All these things we\r\nknew till we were weary; but that night they seemed very strange to us,\r\nbecause the next day we knew we were to be their masters.\r\n\r\n‘The men took the news well; but when Maximus went away with half our\r\nstrength, and we had to spread ourselves into the emptied towers, and the\r\ntownspeople complained that trade would be ruined, and the Autumn gales\r\nblew—it was dark days for us two. Here Pertinax was more than my right\r\nhand. Being born and bred among the great country-houses in Gaul, he knew\r\nthe proper words to address to all—from Roman-born Centurions to those\r\ndogs of the Third—the Libyans. And he spoke to each as though that man\r\nwere as high-minded as himself. Now _I_ saw so strongly what things were\r\nneeded to be done, that I forgot things are only accomplished by means of\r\nmen. That was a mistake.\r\n\r\n‘I feared nothing from the Picts, at least for that year, but Allo warned\r\nme that the Winged Hats would soon come in from the sea at each end of the\r\nWall to prove to the Picts how weak we were. So I made ready in haste, and\r\nnone too soon. I shifted our best men to the ends of the Wall, and set up\r\nscreened catapults by the beach. The Winged Hats would drive in before the\r\nsnow-squalls—ten or twenty boats at a time—on Segedunum or Ituna,\r\naccording as the wind blew.\r\n\r\n‘Now a ship coming in to land men must furl her sail. If you wait till you\r\nsee her men gather up the sail’s foot, your catapults can jerk a net of\r\nloose stones (bolts only cut through the cloth) into the bag of it. Then\r\nshe turns over, and the sea makes everything clean again. A few men may\r\ncome ashore, but very few.... It was not hard work, except the waiting on\r\nthe beach in blowing sand and snow. And that was how we dealt with the\r\nWinged Hats that winter.\r\n\r\n‘Early in the Spring, when the East winds blow like skinning-knives, they\r\ngathered again off the East end with many ships. Allo told me they would\r\nnever rest till they had taken a tower in open fight. Certainly they\r\nfought in the open. We dealt with them thoroughly through a long day: and\r\nwhen all was finished, one man dived clear of the wreckage of his ship,\r\nand swam towards shore. I waited, and a wave tumbled him at my feet.\r\n\r\n‘As I stooped, I saw he wore such a medal as I wear.’ Parnesius raised his\r\nhand to his neck. ‘Therefore, when he could speak, I addressed him a\r\ncertain Question which can only be answered in a certain manner. He\r\nanswered with the necessary Word—the Word that belongs to the Degree of\r\nGryphons in the science of Mithras my God. I put my shield over him till\r\nhe could stand up. You see I am not short, but he was a head taller than\r\nI. He said: “What now?” I said: “At your pleasure, my brother, to stay or\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\n‘He looked out across the surf. There remained one ship unhurt, beyond\r\nrange of our catapults. I checked the catapults and he waved her in. She\r\ncame as a hound comes to a master. When she was yet a hundred paces from\r\nthe beach, he flung back his hair, and swam out. They hauled him in, and\r\nwent away. I knew that those who worship Mithras are many and of all\r\nraces, so I did not think much more upon the matter.\r\n\r\n‘A month later I saw Allo with his horses—by the Temple of Pan, O\r\nFaun!—and he gave me a great necklace of gold studded with coral.\r\n\r\n‘At first I thought it was a bribe from some tradesman in the town—meant\r\nfor old Rutilianus. “Nay,” said Allo. “This is a gift from Amal, that\r\nWinged Hat whom you saved on the beach. He says you are a Man.”\r\n\r\n‘“He is a Man, too. Tell him I can wear his gift,” I answered.\r\n\r\n‘“Oh, Amal is a young fool; but, speaking as sensible men, your Emperor is\r\ndoing such great things in Gaul that the Winged Hats are anxious to be his\r\nfriends, or, better still, the friends of his servants. They think you and\r\nPertinax could lead them to victories.” Allo looked at me like a one-eyed\r\nraven.\r\n\r\n‘“Allo,” I said, “you are the corn between the two millstones. Be content\r\nif they grind evenly, and don’t thrust your hand between them.”\r\n\r\n‘“I?” said Allo. “I hate Rome and the Winged Hats equally; but if the\r\nWinged Hats thought that some day you and Pertinax might join them against\r\nMaximus, they would leave you in peace while you considered. Time is what\r\nwe need—you and I and Maximus. Let me carry a pleasant message back to the\r\nWinged Hats—something for them to make a council over. We barbarians are\r\nall alike. We sit up half the night to discuss anything a Roman says. Eh?”\r\n\r\n‘“We have no men. We must fight with words,” said Pertinax. “Leave it to\r\nAllo and me.”\r\n\r\n‘So Allo carried word back to the Winged Hats that we would not fight them\r\nif they did not fight us; and they (I think they were a little tired of\r\nlosing men in the sea) agreed to a sort of truce. I believe Allo, who\r\nbeing a horse-dealer loved lies, also told them we might some day rise\r\nagainst Maximus as Maximus had risen against Rome.\r\n\r\n‘Indeed, they permitted the corn-ships which I sent to the Picts to pass\r\nNorth that season without harm. Therefore the Picts were well fed that\r\nwinter, and since they were in some sort my children, I was glad of it. We\r\nhad only two thousand men on the Wall, and I wrote many times to Maximus\r\nand begged—prayed—him to send me only one cohort of my old North British\r\ntroops. He could not spare them. He needed them to win more victories in\r\nGaul.\r\n\r\n‘Then came news that he had defeated and slain the Emperor Gratian, and\r\nthinking he must now be secure, I wrote again for men. He answered: “You\r\nwill learn that I have at last settled accounts with the pup Gratian.\r\nThere was no need that he should have died, but he became confused and\r\nlost his head, which is a bad thing to befall any Emperor. Tell your\r\nFather I am content to drive two mules only; for unless my old General’s\r\nson thinks himself destined to destroy me, I shall rest Emperor of Gaul\r\nand Britain, and then you, my two children, will presently get all the men\r\nyou need. Just now I can spare none.”’\r\n\r\n‘What did he mean by his General’s son?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘He meant Theodosius Emperor of Rome, who was the son of Theodosius the\r\nGeneral under whom Maximus had fought in the old Pict War. The two men\r\nnever loved each other, and when Gratian made the younger Theodosius\r\nEmperor of the East (at least, so I’ve heard), Maximus carried on the war\r\nto the second generation. It was his fate, and it was his fall. But\r\nTheodosius the Emperor is a good man. As I know.’ Parnesius was silent for\r\na moment and then continued.\r\n\r\n‘I wrote back to Maximus that, though we had peace on the Wall, I should\r\nbe happier with a few more men and some new catapults. He answered: “You\r\nmust live a little longer under the shadow of my victories, till I can see\r\nwhat young Theodosius intends. He may welcome me as a brother-Emperor, or\r\nhe may be preparing an army. In either case I cannot spare men just now.”’\r\n\r\n‘But he was always saying that,’ cried Una.\r\n\r\n‘It was true. He did not make excuses; but thanks, as he said, to the news\r\nof his victories, we had no trouble on the Wall for a long, long time. The\r\nPicts grew fat as their own sheep among the heather, and as many of my men\r\nas lived were well exercised in their weapons. Yes, the Wall looked\r\nstrong. For myself, I knew how weak we were. I knew that if even a false\r\nrumour of any defeat to Maximus broke loose among the Winged Hats, they\r\nmight come down in earnest, and then—the Wall must go! For the Picts I\r\nnever cared, but in those years I learned something of the strength of the\r\nWinged Hats. They increased their strength every day, but I could not\r\nincrease my men. Maximus had emptied Britain behind us, and I felt myself\r\nto be a man with a rotten stick standing before a broken fence to turn\r\nbulls.\r\n\r\n‘Thus, my friends, we lived on the Wall, waiting—waiting—waiting for the\r\nmen that Maximus never sent!\r\n\r\n‘Presently he wrote that he was preparing an army against Theodosius. He\r\nwrote—and Pertinax read it over my shoulder in our quarters: “_Tell your\r\nFather that my destiny orders me to drive three mules or be torn in pieces\r\nby them. I hope within a year to finish with Theodosius, son of\r\nTheodosius, once and for all. Then you shall have Britain to rule, and\r\nPertinax, if he chooses, Gaul. To-day I wish strongly you were with me to\r\nbeat my Auxiliaries into shape. Do not, I pray you, believe any rumour of\r\nmy sickness. I have a little evil in my old body which I shall cure by\r\nriding swiftly into Rome._”\r\n\r\n‘Said Pertinax: “It is finished with Maximus! He writes as a man without\r\nhope. I, a man without hope, can see this. What does he add at the bottom\r\nof the roll? ‘_Tell __Pertinax I have met his late Uncle, the Duumvir of\r\nDivio, and that he accounted to me quite truthfully for all his Mother’s\r\nmonies. I have sent her with a fitting escort, for she is the mother of a\r\nhero, to Nicæa, where the climate is warm._’\r\n\r\n‘“That is proof!” said Pertinax. “Nicæa is not far by sea from Rome. A\r\nwoman there could take ship and fly to Rome in time of war. Yes, Maximus\r\nforesees his death, and is fulfilling his promises one by one. But I am\r\nglad my Uncle met him.”\r\n\r\n‘“You think blackly to-day?” I asked.\r\n\r\n‘“I think truth. The Gods weary of the play we have played against them.\r\nTheodosius will destroy Maximus. It is finished!”\r\n\r\n‘“Will you write him that?” I said.\r\n\r\n‘“See what I shall write,” he answered, and he took pen and wrote a letter\r\ncheerful as the light of day, tender as a woman’s and full of jests. Even\r\nI, reading over his shoulder, took comfort from it till—I saw his face!\r\n\r\n‘“And now,” he said, sealing it, “we be two dead men, my brother. Let us\r\ngo to the Temple.”\r\n\r\n‘We prayed awhile to Mithras, where we had many times prayed before. After\r\nthat we lived day by day among evil rumours till winter came again.\r\n\r\n‘It happened one morning that we rode to the East Shore, and found on the\r\nbeach a fair-haired man, half frozen, bound to some broken planks. Turning\r\nhim over, we saw by his belt-buckle that he was a Goth of an Eastern\r\nLegion. Suddenly he opened his eyes and cried loudly: “He is dead! The\r\nletters were with me, but the Winged Hats sunk the ship.” So saying, he\r\ndied between our hands.\r\n\r\n‘We asked not who was dead. We knew! We raced before the driving snow to\r\nHunno, thinking perhaps Allo might be there. We found him already at our\r\nstables, and he saw by our faces what we had heard.\r\n\r\n‘“It was in a tent by the Sea,” he stammered. “He was beheaded by\r\nTheodosius. He sent a letter to you, written while he waited to be slain.\r\nThe Winged Hats met the ship and took it. The news is running through the\r\nheather like fire. Blame me not! I cannot hold back my young men any\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n‘“I would we could say as much for our men,” said Pertinax, laughing.\r\n“But, Gods be praised, they cannot run away.”\r\n\r\n‘“What do you do?” said Allo. “I bring an order—a message—from the Winged\r\nHats that you join them with your men, and march South to plunder\r\nBritain.”\r\n\r\n‘“It grieves me,” said Pertinax, “but we are stationed here to stop that\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n‘“If I carry back such an answer they will kill me,” said Allo. “I always\r\npromised the Winged Hats that you would rise when Maximus fell. I—I did\r\nnot think he could fall.”\r\n\r\n‘“Alas! my poor barbarian,” said Pertinax, still laughing. “Well, you have\r\nsold us too many good ponies to be thrown back to your friends. We will\r\nmake you a prisoner, although you are an ambassador.”\r\n\r\n‘“Yes, that will be best,” said Allo, holding out a halter. We bound him\r\nlightly, for he was an old man.\r\n\r\n‘“Presently the Winged Hats may come to look for you, and that will give\r\nus more time. See how the habit of playing for time sticks to a man!” said\r\nPertinax, as he tied the rope.\r\n\r\n‘“No,” I said. “Time may help. If Maximus wrote us letters while he was a\r\nprisoner, Theodosius must have sent the ship that brought it. If he can\r\nsend ships, he can send men.”\r\n\r\n‘“How will that profit us?” said Pertinax. “We serve Maximus, not\r\nTheodosius. Even if by some miracle of the Gods Theodosius down South sent\r\nand saved the Wall, we could not expect more than the death Maximus died.”\r\n\r\n‘“It concerns us to defend the Wall, no matter what Emperor dies, or makes\r\ndie,” I said.\r\n\r\n‘“That is worthy of your brother the philosopher,” said Pertinax. “Myself\r\nI am without hope, so I do not say solemn and stupid things! Rouse the\r\nWall!”\r\n\r\n‘We armed the Wall from end to end; we told the officers that there was a\r\nrumour of Maximus’s death which might bring down the Winged Hats, but we\r\nwere sure, even if it were true, that Theodosius, for the sake of Britain,\r\nwould send us help. Therefore, we must stand fast.... My friends, it is\r\nabove all things strange to see how men bear ill news! Often the strongest\r\ntill then become the weakest, while the weakest, as it were, reach up and\r\nsteal strength from the Gods. So it was with us. Yet my Pertinax by his\r\njests and his courtesy and his labours had put heart and training into our\r\npoor numbers during the past years—more than I should have thought\r\npossible. Even our Libyan Cohort—the Thirds—stood up in their padded\r\ncuirasses and did not whimper.\r\n\r\n‘In three days came seven chiefs and elders of the Winged Hats. Among them\r\nwas that tall young man, Amal, whom I had met on the beach, and he smiled\r\nwhen he saw my necklace. We made them welcome, for they were ambassadors.\r\nWe showed them Allo, alive but bound. They thought we had killed him, and\r\nI saw it would not have vexed them if we had. Allo saw it too, and it\r\nvexed him. Then in our quarters at Hunno we came to Council.\r\n\r\n‘They said that Rome was falling, and that we must join them. They offered\r\nme all South Britain to govern after they had taken a tribute out of it.\r\n\r\n‘I answered, “Patience. This Wall is not weighed off like plunder. Give me\r\nproof that my General is dead.”\r\n\r\n‘“Nay,” said one elder, “prove to us that he lives”; and another said,\r\ncunningly, “What will you give us if we read you his last words?”\r\n\r\n‘“We are not merchants to bargain,” cried Amal. “Moreover, I owe this man\r\nmy life. He shall have his proof.” He threw across to me a letter (well I\r\nknew the seal) from Maximus.\r\n\r\n‘“We took this out of the ship we sunk,” he cried. “I cannot read, but I\r\nknow one sign, at least, which makes me believe.” He showed me a dark\r\nstain on the outer roll that my heavy heart perceived was the valiant\r\nblood of Maximus.\r\n\r\n‘“Read!” said Amal. “Read, and then let us hear whose servants you are!”\r\n\r\n‘Said Pertinax, very softly, after he had looked through it: “I will read\r\nit all. Listen, barbarians!” He read from that which I have carried next\r\nmy heart ever since.’\r\n\r\nParnesius drew from his neck a folded and spotted piece of parchment, and\r\nbegan in a hushed voice:—\r\n\r\n‘“_To Parnesius and Pertinax, the not unworthy Captains of the Wall, from\r\nMaximus, once Emperor of Gaul and Britain, now prisoner waiting death by\r\nthe sea in the camp of Theodosius—Greeting and Good-bye!_”\r\n\r\n‘“Enough,” said young Amal; “there is your proof! You must join us now!”\r\n\r\n‘Pertinax looked long and silently at him, till that fair man blushed like\r\na girl. Then read Pertinax:—\r\n\r\n‘“_I have joyfully done much evil in my life to those who have wished me\r\nevil, but if ever I did any evil to you two I repent, and I ask your\r\nforgiveness. The three mules which I strove to drive have torn me in\r\npieces as your Father prophesied. The naked swords wait at the tent door\r\nto give me the death I gave to Gratian. Therefore I, your General and your\r\nEmperor, send you free and honourable dismissal from my service, which you\r\nentered, not for money __or office, but, as it makes me warm to believe,\r\nbecause you loved me!_”\r\n\r\n‘“By the Light of the Sun,” Amal broke in. “This was in some sort a Man!\r\nWe may have been mistaken in his servants!”\r\n\r\n‘And Pertinax read on: “_You gave me the time for which I asked. If I have\r\nfailed to use it, do not lament. We have gambled very splendidly against\r\nthe Gods, but they hold weighted dice, and I must pay the forfeit.\r\nRemember, I have been; but Rome is; and Rome will be! Tell Pertinax his\r\nMother is in safety at Nicæa, and her monies are in charge of the Prefect\r\nat Antipolis. Make my remembrances to your Father and to your Mother,\r\nwhose friendship was great gain to me. Give also to my little Picts and to\r\nthe Winged Hats such messages as their thick heads can understand. I would\r\nhave sent you three Legions this very day if all had gone aright. Do not\r\nforget me. We have worked together. Farewell! Farewell! Farewell!_”\r\n\r\n‘Now, that was my Emperor’s last letter.’ (The children heard the\r\nparchment crackle as Parnesius returned it to its place.)\r\n\r\n‘“I was mistaken,” said Amal. “The servants of such a man will sell\r\nnothing except over the sword. I am glad of it.” He held out his hand to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n‘“But Maximus has given you your dismissal,” said an elder. “You are\r\ncertainly free to serve—or to rule—whom you please. Join—do not\r\nfollow—join us!”\r\n\r\n‘“We thank you,” said Pertinax. “But Maximus tells us to give you such\r\nmessages as—pardon me, but I use his words—your thick heads can\r\nunderstand.” He pointed through the door to the foot of a catapult wound\r\nup.\r\n\r\n‘“We understand,” said an elder. “The Wall must be won at a price?”\r\n\r\n‘“It grieves me,” said Pertinax, laughing, “but so it must be won,” and he\r\ngave them of our best Southern wine.\r\n\r\n‘They drank, and wiped their yellow beards in silence till they rose to\r\ngo.\r\n\r\n‘Said Amal, stretching himself (for they were barbarians), “We be a goodly\r\ncompany; I wonder what the ravens and the dogfish will make of some of us\r\nbefore this snow melts.”\r\n\r\n‘“Think rather what Theodosius may send,” I answered; and though they\r\nlaughed, I saw that my chance shot troubled them.\r\n\r\n‘Only old Allo lingered behind a little.\r\n\r\n‘“You see,” he said, winking and blinking, “I am no more than their dog.\r\nWhen I have shown their men the secret short ways across our bogs, they\r\nwill kick me like one.”\r\n\r\n‘“Then I should not be in haste to show them those ways,” said Pertinax,\r\n“till I were sure that Rome could not save the Wall.”\r\n\r\n‘“You think so? Woe is me!” said the old man. “I only wanted peace for my\r\npeople,” and he went out stumbling through the snow behind the tall Winged\r\nHats.\r\n\r\n‘In this fashion then, slowly, a day at a time, which is very bad for\r\ndoubting troops, the War came upon us. At first the Winged Hats swept in\r\nfrom the sea as they had done before, and there we met them as before—with\r\nthe catapults; and they sickened of it. Yet for a long time they would not\r\ntrust their duck-legs on land, and I think when it came to revealing the\r\nsecrets of the tribe, the little Picts were afraid or ashamed to show them\r\nall the roads across the heather. I had this from a Pict prisoner. They\r\nwere as much our spies as our enemies, for the Winged Hats oppressed them,\r\nand took their winter stores. Ah, foolish Little People!\r\n\r\n‘Then the Winged Hats began to roll us up from each end of the Wall. I\r\nsent runners Southward to see what the news might be in Britain; but the\r\nwolves were very bold that winter among the deserted stations where the\r\ntroops had once been, and none came back. We had trouble too with the\r\nforage for the ponies along the Wall. I kept ten, and so did Pertinax. We\r\nlived and slept in the saddle riding east or west, and we ate our worn-out\r\nponies. The people of the town also made us some trouble till I gathered\r\nthem all in one quarter behind Hunno. We broke down the Wall on either\r\nside of it to make as it were a citadel. Our men fought better in close\r\norder.\r\n\r\n‘By the end of the second month we were deep in the War as a man is deep\r\nin a snow-drift or in a dream. I think we fought in our sleep. At least I\r\nknow I have gone on the Wall and come off again, remembering nothing\r\nbetween, though my throat was harsh with giving orders, and my sword, I\r\ncould see, had been used.\r\n\r\n‘The Winged Hats fought like wolves—all in a pack. Where they had suffered\r\nmost, there they charged in most hotly. This was hard for the defender,\r\nbut it held them from sweeping on into Britain.\r\n\r\n‘In those days Pertinax and I wrote on the plaster of the bricked archway\r\ninto Valentia the names of the towers, and the days on which they fell one\r\nby one. We wished for some record.\r\n\r\n‘And the fighting? The fight was always hottest to left and right of the\r\ngreat Statue of Roma Dea, near to Rutilianus’ house. By the light of the\r\nSun, that old fat man, whom we had not considered at all, grew young again\r\namong the trumpets! I remember he said his sword was an oracle! “Let us\r\nconsult the Oracle,” he would say, and put the handle against his ear, and\r\nshake his head wisely. “And _this_ day is allowed Rutilianus to live,” he\r\nwould say, and, tucking up his cloak, he would puff and pant and fight\r\nwell. Oh, there were jests in plenty on the Wall to take the place of\r\nfood!\r\n\r\n‘We endured for two months and seventeen days—always being pressed from\r\nthree sides into a smaller space. Several times Allo sent in word that\r\nhelp was at hand. We did not believe it, but it cheered our men.\r\n\r\n‘The end came not with shoutings of joy, but, like the rest, as in a\r\ndream. The Winged Hats suddenly left us in peace for one night, and the\r\nnext day; which is too long for spent men. We slept at first lightly,\r\nexpecting to be roused, and then like logs, each where he lay. May you\r\nnever need such sleep! When I waked our towers were full of strange, armed\r\nmen, who watched us snoring. I roused Pertinax, and we leaped up together.\r\n\r\n‘“What?” said a young man in clean armour. “Do you fight against\r\nTheodosius? Look!”\r\n\r\n‘North we looked over the red snow. No Winged Hats were there. South we\r\nlooked over the white snow, and behold there were the Eagles of two strong\r\nLegions encamped. East and west we saw flame and fighting, but by Hunno\r\nall was still.\r\n\r\n‘“Trouble no more,” said the young man. “Rome’s arm is long. Where are the\r\nCaptains of the Wall?”\r\n\r\n‘We said we were those men.\r\n\r\n‘“But you are old and grey-haired,” he cried. “Maximus said that they were\r\nboys.”\r\n\r\n‘“Yes that was true some years ago,” said Pertinax. “What is our fate to\r\nbe, you fine and well-fed child?”\r\n\r\n‘“I am called Ambrosius, a secretary of the Emperor,” he answered. “Show\r\nme a certain letter which Maximus wrote from a tent at Aquileia, and\r\nperhaps I will believe.”\r\n\r\n‘I took it from my breast, and when he had read it he saluted us, saying:\r\n“Your fate is in your own hands. If you choose to serve Theodosius, he\r\nwill give you a Legion. If it suits you to go to your homes, we will give\r\nyou a Triumph.”\r\n\r\n‘“I would like better a bath, wine, food, razors, soaps, oils, and\r\nscents,” said Pertinax, laughing.\r\n\r\n‘“Oh, I see you are a boy,” said Ambrosius. “And you?” turning to me.\r\n\r\n‘“We bear no ill-will against Theodosius, but in War——” I began.\r\n\r\n‘“In War it is as it is in Love,” said Pertinax. “Whether she be good or\r\nbad, one gives one’s best once, to one only. That given, there remains no\r\nsecond worth giving or taking.”\r\n\r\n‘“That is true,” said Ambrosius. “I was with Maximus before he died. He\r\nwarned Theodosius that you would never serve him, and frankly I say I am\r\nsorry for my Emperor.”\r\n\r\n‘“He has Rome to console him,” said Pertinax. “I ask you of your kindness\r\nto let us go to our homes and get this smell out of our nostrils.”\r\n\r\n‘None the less they gave us a Triumph!’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It was well earned,’ said Puck, throwing some leaves into the still water\r\nof the marlpit. The black, oily circles spread dizzily as the children\r\nwatched them.\r\n\r\n‘I want to know, oh, ever so many things,’ said Dan, ‘What happened to old\r\nAllo? Did the Winged Hats ever come back? And what did Amal do?’\r\n\r\n‘And what happened to the fat old General with the five cooks?’ said Una.\r\n‘And what did your Mother say when you came home?’...\r\n\r\n‘She’d say you’re settin’ too long over this old pit, so late as ’tis\r\nalready,’ said old Hobden’s voice behind them. ‘Hst!’ he whispered.\r\n\r\nHe stood still, for not twenty paces away a magnificent dog-fox sat on his\r\nhaunches and looked at the children as though he were an old friend of\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Mus’ Reynolds, Mus’ Reynolds!’ said Hobden, under his breath. ‘If I\r\nknowed all was inside your head, I’d know something wuth knowin’. Mus’ Dan\r\nan’ Miss Una, come along o’ me while I lock up my liddle hen-house.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PICT SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Rome never looks where she treads,_\r\n    _Always her heavy hooves fall,_\r\n  _On our stomachs, our hearts or our heads;_\r\n    _And Rome never heeds when we bawl._\r\n  _Her sentries pass on—that is all,_\r\n    _And we gather behind them in hordes,_\r\n  _And plot to reconquer the Wall,_\r\n    _With only our tongues for our swords._\r\n\r\n  _We are the Little Folk—we!_\r\n    _Too little to love or to hate._\r\n  _Leave us alone and you’ll see_\r\n    _How we can drag down the Great!_\r\n  _We are the worm in the wood!_\r\n    _We are the rot at the root!_\r\n  _We are the germ in the blood!_\r\n    _We are the thorn in the foot!_\r\n\r\n  _Mistletoe killing an oak—_\r\n    _Rats gnawing cables in two—_\r\n  _Moths making holes in a cloak—_\r\n    _How they must love what they do!_\r\n  _Yes,—and we Little Folk too,_\r\n    _We are as busy as they—_\r\n  _Working our works out of view—_\r\n    _Watch, and you’ll see it some day!_\r\n\r\n  _No indeed!

If you don’t mind rats on the rafters and oats in your shoes, the\r\nmill-attic, with its trap-doors and inscriptions on beams about floods and\r\nsweethearts, is a splendid place. It is lighted by a foot-square window,\r\ncalled Duck Window, that looks across to Little Lindens Farm, and the spot\r\nwhere Jack Cade was killed.\r\n\r\nWhen they had climbed the attic ladder (they called it the ‘mainmast tree’\r\nout of the ballad of Sir Andrew Barton, and Dan ‘swarved it with might and\r\nmain,’ as the ballad says) they saw a man sitting on Duck window-sill. He\r\nwas dressed in a plum-coloured doublet and tight plum-coloured hose, and\r\nhe drew busily in a red-edged book.\r\n\r\n‘Sit ye! Sit ye!’ Puck cried from a rafter overhead. ‘See what it is to be\r\nbeautiful! Sir Harry Dawe—pardon, Hal—says I am the very image of a head\r\nfor a gargoyle.’\r\n\r\nThe man laughed and raised his dark velvet cap to the children, and his\r\ngrizzled hair bristled out in a stormy fringe. He was old—forty at\r\nleast—but his eyes were young, with funny little wrinkles all round them.\r\nA satchel of embroidered leather hung from his broad belt, which looked\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\n‘May we see?’ said Una, coming forward.\r\n\r\n‘Surely—sure-ly!’ he said, moving up on the window-seat, and returned to\r\nhis work with a silver-pointed pencil. Puck sat as though the grin were\r\nfixed for ever on his broad face, while they watched the quick, certain\r\nfingers that copied it. Presently the man took a reed pen from his\r\nsatchel, and trimmed it with a little ivory knife, carved in the semblance\r\nof a fish.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, what a beauty!’ cried Dan.\r\n\r\n‘’Ware fingers! That blade is perilous sharp. I made it myself of the best\r\nLow Country cross-bow steel. And so, too, this fish. When his back-fin\r\ntravels to his tail—so—he swallows up the blade, even as the whale\r\nswallowed Gaffer Jonah.... Yes, and that’s my ink-horn. I made the four\r\nsilver saints round it. Press Barnabas’s head. It opens, and then——’ He\r\ndipped the trimmed pen, and with careful boldness began to put in the\r\nessential lines of Puck’s rugged face, that had been but faintly revealed\r\nby the silver-point.\r\n\r\nThe children gasped, for it fairly leaped from the page.\r\n\r\nAs he worked, and the rain fell on the tiles, he talked—now clearly, now\r\nmuttering, now breaking off to frown or smile at his work. He told them he\r\nwas born at Little Lindens Farms, and his father used to beat him for\r\ndrawing things instead of doing things, till an old priest called Father\r\nRoger, who drew illuminated letters in rich people’s books, coaxed the\r\nparents to let him take the boy as a sort of painter’s apprentice. Then he\r\nwent with Father Roger to Oxford, where he cleaned plates and carried\r\ncloaks and shoes for the scholars of a College called Merton.\r\n\r\n‘Didn’t you hate that?’ said Dan after a great many other questions.\r\n\r\n‘I never thought on’t. Half Oxford was building new colleges or\r\nbeautifying the old, and she had called to her aid the master-craftsmen of\r\nall Christendie—kings in their trade and honoured of Kings. I knew them. I\r\nworked for them: that was enough. No wonder——’ He stopped and laughed.\r\n\r\n‘You became a great man,’ said Puck.\r\n\r\n‘They said so, Robin. Even Bramante said so.’\r\n\r\n‘Why? What did you do?’ Dan asked.\r\n\r\nThe artist looked at him queerly. ‘Things in stone and such, up and down\r\nEngland. You would not have heard of ’em. To come nearer home, I\r\nre-builded this little St. Bartholomew’s church of ours. It cost me more\r\ntrouble and sorrow than aught I’ve touched in my life. But ’twas a sound\r\nlesson.’\r\n\r\n‘Um,’ said Dan. ‘We had lessons this morning.’\r\n\r\n‘I’ll not afflict ye, lad,’ said Hal, while Puck roared. ‘Only ’tis\r\nstrange to think how that little church was re-built, re-roofed, and made\r\nglorious, thanks to some few godly Sussex iron-masters, a Bristol sailor\r\nlad, a proud ass called Hal o’ the Draft because, d’you see, he was always\r\ndrawing and drafting; and’—he dragged the words slowly—‘_and_ a Scotch\r\npirate.’\r\n\r\n‘Pirate?’ said Dan. He wriggled like a hooked fish.\r\n\r\n‘Even that Andrew Barton you were singing of on the stair just now.’ He\r\ndipped again in the ink-well, and held his breath over a sweeping line, as\r\nthough he had forgotten everything else.\r\n\r\n‘Pirates don’t build churches, do they?’ said Dan. ‘Or _do_ they?’\r\n\r\n‘They help mightily,’ Hal laughed. ‘But you were at your lessons this\r\nmorn, Jack Scholar?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, pirates aren’t lessons. It was only Bruce and his silly old spider,’\r\nsaid Una. ‘Why did Sir Andrew Barton help you?’\r\n\r\n‘I question if he ever knew it,’ said Hal, twinkling. ‘Robin, how\r\na-mischief’s name am I to tell these innocents what comes of sinful\r\npride?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, we know all about _that_,’ said Una pertly. ‘If you get too\r\nbeany—that’s cheeky—you get sat upon, of course.’\r\n\r\nHal considered a moment, pen in air, and Puck said some long words.\r\n\r\n‘Aha! That was my case too,’ he cried. ‘Beany—you say—but certainly I did\r\nnot conduct myself well. I was proud of—of such things as porches—a\r\nGalilee porch at Lincoln for choice—proud of one Torrigiano’s arm on my\r\nshoulder, proud of my knighthood when I made the gilt scroll-work for _The\r\nSovereign_—our King’s ship. But Father Roger sitting in Merton Library, he\r\ndid not forget me. At the top of my pride, when I and no other should have\r\nbuilded the porch at Lincoln, he laid it on me with a terrible forefinger\r\nto go back to my Sussex clays and re-build, at my own charges, my own\r\nchurch, where we Dawes have been buried for six generations. “Out! Son of\r\nmy Art!” said he. “Fight the Devil at home ere you call yourself a man and\r\na craftsman.” And I quaked, and I went.... How’s yon, Robin?’ He\r\nflourished the finished sketch before Puck.\r\n\r\n‘Me! Me past peradventure,’ said Puck, smirking like a man at a mirror.\r\n‘Ah, see! The rain has took off! I hate housen in daylight.’\r\n\r\n‘Whoop! Holiday!’ cried Hal, leaping up. ‘Who’s for my Little Lindens? We\r\ncan talk there.’\r\n\r\nThey tumbled downstairs, and turned past the dripping willows by the sunny\r\nmill dam.\r\n\r\n‘Body o’ me,’ said Hal, staring at the hop-garden, where the hops were\r\njust ready to blossom. ‘What are these vines? No, not vines, and they\r\ntwine the wrong way to beans.’ He began to draw in his ready book.\r\n\r\n‘Hops. New since your day,’ said Puck. ‘They’re an herb of Mars, and their\r\nflowers dried flavour ale. We say:—\r\n\r\n  ‘“Turkeys, Heresy, Hops, and Beer\r\n  Came into England all in one year.”’\r\n\r\n‘Heresy I know. I’ve seen Hops—God be praised for their beauty! What is\r\nyour Turkis?’\r\n\r\nThe children laughed. They knew the Lindens turkeys, and as soon as they\r\nreached Lindens’ orchard on the hill the flock charged at them.\r\n\r\nOut came Hal’s book at once. ‘Hoity-toity!’ he cried. ‘Here’s Pride in\r\npurple feathers! Here’s wrathy contempt and the Pomps of the Flesh! How\r\nd’you call _them_?’\r\n\r\n‘Turkeys! Turkeys!’ the children shouted, as the old gobbler raved and\r\nflamed against Hal’s plum-coloured hose.\r\n\r\n‘Save Your Magnificence!’ he said. ‘I’ve drafted two good new things\r\nto-day.’ And he doffed his cap to the bubbling bird.\r\n\r\nThen they walked through the grass to the knoll where Little Lindens\r\nstands. The old farm-house, weather-tiled to the ground, took almost the\r\ncolour of a blood-ruby in the afternoon light. The pigeons pecked at the\r\nmortar in the chimney-stacks; the bees that had lived under the tiles\r\nsince it was built filled the hot August air with their booming; and the\r\nsmell of the box-tree by the dairy-window mixed with the smell of earth\r\nafter rain, bread after baking, and a tickle of wood-smoke.\r\n\r\nThe farmer’s wife came to the door, baby on arm, shaded her brows against\r\nthe sun, stooped to pluck a sprig of rosemary, and turned down the\r\norchard. The old spaniel in his barrel barked once or twice to show he was\r\nin charge of the empty house. Puck clicked back the garden-gate.\r\n\r\n‘D’you marvel that I love it?’ said Hal, in a whisper. ‘What can town folk\r\nknow of the nature of housen—or land?’\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ‘Hoity-toity,’ he cried. ‘Here’s Pride in purple\r\n  feathers! Here’s wrathy contempt and the Pomps of the Flesh!’... And\r\n  he doffed his cap to the bubbling bird.]\r\n\r\nThey perched themselves arow on the old hacked oak bench in Lindens’\r\ngarden, looking across the valley of the brook at the fern-covered dimples\r\nand hollows of the Forge behind Hobden’s cottage. The old man was cutting\r\na faggot in his garden by the hives. It was quite a second after his\r\nchopper fell that the chump of the blow reached their lazy ears.\r\n\r\n‘Eh—yeh!’ said Hal. ‘I mind when where that old gaffer stands was Nether\r\nForge—Master John Collins’s foundry. Many a night has his big trip-hammer\r\nshook me in my bed here. _Boom-bitty! Boom-bitty!_ If the wind was east, I\r\ncould hear Master Tom Collins’s forge at Stockens answering his brother,\r\n_Boom-oop! Boom-oop!_ and midway between, Sir John Pelham’s sledge-hammers\r\nat Brightling would strike in like a pack o’scholars, and “_Hic-haec-hoc_”\r\nthey’d say, “_Hic-haec-hoc_,” till I fell asleep. Yes. The valley was as\r\nfull o’ forges and fineries as a May shaw o’ cuckoos. All gone to grass\r\nnow!’\r\n\r\n‘What did they make?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Guns for the King’s ships—and for others. Serpentines and cannon mostly.\r\nWhen the guns were cast, down would come the King’s Officers, and take our\r\nplough-oxen to haul them to the coast. Look! Here’s one of the first and\r\nfinest craftsmen of the Sea!’\r\n\r\nHe fluttered back a page of his book, and showed them a young man’s head.\r\nUnderneath was written: ‘Sebastianus.’\r\n\r\n‘He came down with a King’s Order on Master John Collins for twenty\r\nserpentines (wicked little cannon they be!) to furnish a venture of ships.\r\nI drafted him thus sitting by our fire telling Mother of the new lands\r\nhe’d find the far side the world. And he found them, too! There’s a nose\r\nto cleave through unknown seas! Cabot was his name—a Bristol lad—half a\r\nforeigner. I set a heap by him. He helped me to my church-building.’\r\n\r\n‘I thought that was Sir Andrew Barton,’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Ay, but foundations before roofs,’ Hal answered. ‘Sebastian first put me\r\nin the way of it. I had come down here, not to serve God as a craftsman\r\nshould, but to show my people how great a craftsman I was. They cared not,\r\nand it served me right, one split straw for my craft or my greatness. What\r\na murrain call had I, they said, to mell with old St. Barnabas’s? Ruinous\r\nthe church had been since the Black Death, and ruinous she should remain;\r\nand I could hang myself in my new scaffold-ropes! Gentle and simple, high\r\nand low—the Hayes, the Fowles, the Fanners, the Collinses—they were all in\r\na tale against me. Only Sir John Pelham up yonder to Brightling bade me\r\nheart-up and go on. Yet how could I? Did I ask Master Collins for his\r\ntimber-tug to haul beams? The oxen had gone to Lewes after lime. Did he\r\npromise me a set of iron cramps or ties for the roof? They never came to\r\nhand, or else they were spaulty or cracked. So with everything. Nothing\r\nsaid, but naught done except I stood by them, and then done amiss. I\r\nthought the countryside was fair bewitched.’\r\n\r\n‘It was, sure-ly,’ said Puck, knees under chin. ‘Did you never suspect any\r\none?’\r\n\r\n‘Not till Sebastian came for his guns, and John Collins played him the\r\nsame dog’s tricks as he’d played me with my ironwork. Week in, week out,\r\ntwo of three serpentines would be flawed in the casting, and only fit,\r\nthey said, to be remelted. Then John Collins would shake his head, and vow\r\nhe could pass no cannon for the King’s service that were not perfect.\r\nSaints! How Sebastian stormed! _I_ know, for we sat on this bench sharing\r\nour sorrows inter-common.\r\n\r\n‘When Sebastian had fumed away six weeks at Lindens and gotten just six\r\nserpentines, Dirk Brenzett, Master of the _Cygnet_ hoy, sends me word that\r\nthe block of stone he was fetching me from France for our new font he’d\r\nhove overboard to lighten his ship, chased by Andrew Barton up to Rye\r\nPort.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah! The pirate!’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Yes. And while I am tearing my hair over this, Ticehurst Will, my best\r\nmason, comes to me shaking, and vowing that the Devil, horned, tailed, and\r\nchained, has run out on him from the church-tower, and the men would work\r\nthere no more. So I took ’em off the foundations, which we were\r\nstrengthening, and went into the Bell Tavern for a cup of ale. Says Master\r\nJohn Collins: “Have it your own way, lad; but if I was you, I’d take the\r\nsinnification o’ the sign, and leave old Barnabas’s Church alone!” And\r\nthey all wagged their sinful heads, and agreed. Less afraid of the Devil\r\nthan of me—as I saw later.\r\n\r\n‘When I brought my sweet news to Lindens, Sebastian was limewashing the\r\nkitchen-beams for Mother. He loved her like a son.\r\n\r\n‘“Cheer up, lad,” he says. “God’s where He was. Only you and I chance to\r\nbe pure pute asses! We’ve been tricked, Hal, and more shame to me, a\r\nsailor, that I did not guess it before! You must leave your belfry alone,\r\nforsooth, because the Devil is adrift there; and I cannot get my\r\nserpentines because John Collins cannot cast them aright. Meantime Andrew\r\nBarton hawks off the Port of Rye. And why? To take those very serpentines\r\nwhich poor Cabot must whistle for; the said serpentines, I’ll wager my\r\nshare of new Continents, being now hid away in St. Barnabas church tower.\r\nClear as the Irish coast at noonday!”\r\n\r\n‘“They’d sure never dare to do it,” I said; “and for another thing,\r\nselling cannon to the King’s enemies is black treason—hanging and fine.”\r\n\r\n‘“It is sure large profit. Men’ll dare any gallows for that. I have been a\r\ntrader myself,” says he. “We must be upsides with ’em for the honour of\r\nBristol.”\r\n\r\n‘Then he hatched a plot, sitting on the lime-wash bucket. We gave out to\r\nride o’ Tuesday to London and made a show of making farewells of our\r\nfriends—especially of Master John Collins. But at Wadhurst Woods we\r\nturned; rode by night to the watermeadows; hid our horses in a willow-tot\r\nat the foot of the glebe, and stole a-tiptoe up hill to Barnabas’s church\r\nagain. A thick mist, and a moon coming through.\r\n\r\n‘I had no sooner locked the tower-door behind us than over goes Sebastian\r\nfull length in the dark.\r\n\r\n‘“Pest!” he says. “Step high and feel low, Hal. I’ve stumbled over guns\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n‘I groped, and one by one—the tower was pitchy dark—I counted the lither\r\nbarrels of twenty serpentines laid out on pease-straw. No conceal at all!\r\n\r\n‘“There’s two demi-cannon my end,” says Sebastian, slapping metal.\r\n“They’ll be for Andrew Barton’s lower deck. Honest—honest John Collins! So\r\nthis is his warehouse, his arsenal, his armoury! Now, see you why your\r\npokings and pryings have raised the Devil in Sussex? You’ve hindered\r\nJohn’s lawful trade for months,” and he laughed where he lay.\r\n\r\n‘A clay-cold tower is no fireside at midnight, so we climbed the belfry\r\nstairs, and there Sebastian trips over a cow-hide with its horns and tail.\r\n\r\n‘“Aha! Your Devil has left his doublet! Does it become me, Hal?” He draws\r\nit on and capers in the slits of window-moonlight—won’erful devilish-like.\r\nThen he sits on the stair, rapping with his tail on a board, and his\r\nback-aspect was dreader than his front; and a howlet lit in, and screeched\r\nat the horns of him.\r\n\r\n‘“If you’d keep out the Devil, shut the door,” he whispered. “And that’s\r\nanother false proverb, Hal, for I can hear your tower-door opening.”\r\n\r\n‘“I locked it. Who a-plague has another key, then?” I said.\r\n\r\n‘“All the congregation, to judge by their feet,” he says, and peers into\r\nthe blackness. “Still! Still, Hal! Hear ’em grunt! That’s more o’ my\r\nserpentines, I’ll be bound. One—two—three—four they bear in! Faith, Andrew\r\nequips himself like an admiral! Twenty-four serpentines in all!”\r\n\r\n‘As if it had been an echo, we heard John Collins’s voice come up all\r\nhollow: “Twenty-four serpentines and two demi-cannon. That’s the full\r\ntally for Sir Andrew Barton.”\r\n\r\n‘“Courtesy costs naught,” whispers Sebastian. “Shall I drop my dagger on\r\nhis head?”\r\n\r\n‘“They go over to Rye o’ Thursday in the wool-wains, hid under the wool\r\npacks. Dirk Brenzett meets them at Udimore, as before,” says John.\r\n\r\n‘“Lord! What a worn, handsmooth trade it is!” says Sebastian. “I lay we\r\nare the sole two babes in the village that have not our lawful share in\r\nthe venture.”\r\n\r\n‘There was a full score folk below, talking like all Robertsbridge Market.\r\nWe counted them by voice.\r\n\r\n‘Master John Collins pipes: “The guns for the French carrack must lie here\r\nnext month. Will, when does your young fool (me, so please you!) come back\r\nfrom Lunnon?”\r\n\r\n‘“No odds,” I heard Ticehurst Will answer. “Lay ’em just where you’ve a\r\nmind, Mus’ Collins. We’re all too afraid o’ the Devil to mell with the\r\ntower now.” And the long knave laughed.\r\n\r\n‘“Ah! ’tis easy enow for you to raise the Devil, Will,” says another—Ralph\r\nHobden from the Forge.\r\n\r\n‘“Aaa-men!” roars Sebastian, and ere I could hold him, he leaps down the\r\nstairs—won’erful devilish-like—howling no bounds. He had scarce time to\r\nlay out for the nearest than they ran. Saints, how they ran! We heard them\r\npound on the door of the Bell Tavern, and then we ran too.\r\n\r\n‘“What’s next?” says Sebastian, looping up his cow-tail as he leaped the\r\nbriars. “I’ve broke honest John’s face.”\r\n\r\n‘“Ride to Sir John Pelham’s,” I said. “He is the only one that ever stood\r\nby me.”\r\n\r\n‘We rode to Brightling, and past Sir John’s lodges, where the keepers\r\nwould have shot at us for deer-stealers, and we had Sir John down into his\r\nJustice’s chair, and when we had told him our tale and showed him the\r\ncow-hide which Sebastian wore still girt about him, he laughed till the\r\ntears ran.\r\n\r\n‘“Wel-a-well!” he says. “I’ll see justice done before daylight. What’s\r\nyour complaint? Master Collins is my old friend.”\r\n\r\n‘“He’s none of mine,” I cried. “When I think how he and his likes have\r\nbaulked and dozened and cozened me at every turn over the church”——and I\r\nchoked at the thought.\r\n\r\n‘“Ah, but ye see now they needed it for another use,” says he, smoothly.\r\n\r\n‘“So they did my serpentines,” Sebastian cries. “I should be half across\r\nthe Western Ocean by this if my guns had been ready. But they’re sold to a\r\nScotch pirate by your old friend.”\r\n\r\n‘“Where’s your proof?” says Sir John, stroking his beard.\r\n\r\n‘“I broke my shins over them not an hour since, and I heard John give\r\norder where they were to be taken,” says Sebastian.\r\n\r\n‘“Words! Words only,” says Sir John. “Master Collins is somewhat of a liar\r\nat best.”\r\n\r\n‘He carried it so gravely, that for the moment, I thought he was dipped in\r\nthis secret traffick too, and that there was not an honest ironmaster in\r\nSussex.\r\n\r\n‘“Name o’ Reason!” says Sebastian, and raps with his cow-tail on the\r\ntable, “Whose guns are they, then?”\r\n\r\n‘“Yours, manifestly,” says Sir John. “You come with the King’s Order for\r\n’em, and Master Collins casts them in his foundry. If he chooses to bring\r\nthem up from Nether Forge and lay ’em out in the church tower, why they\r\nare e’en so much the nearer to the main road and you are saved a day’s\r\nhauling. What a coil to make of a mere act of neighbourly kindness, lad!”\r\n\r\n‘“I fear I have requited him very scurvily,” says Sebastian, looking at\r\nhis knuckles. “But what of the demi-cannon? I could do with ’em well, but\r\n_they_ are not in the King’s Order.”\r\n\r\n‘“Kindness—loving-kindness,” says Sir John. “Questionless, in his zeal for\r\nthe King and his love for you, John adds those two cannon as a gift. ’Tis\r\nplain as this coming daylight, ye stockfish!”\r\n\r\n‘“So it is,” says Sebastian. “Oh, Sir John, Sir John, why did you never\r\nuse the sea? You are lost ashore.” And he looked on him with great love.\r\n\r\n‘“I do my best in my station.” Sir John strokes his beard again and rolls\r\nforth his deep drumming Justice’s voice thus:—“But—suffer me!—you two\r\nlads, on some midnight frolic into which I probe not, roystering around\r\nthe taverns, surprise Master Collins at his”—he thinks a moment—“at his\r\ngood deeds done by stealth. Ye surprise him, I say, cruelly.”\r\n\r\n‘“Truth, Sir John. If you had seen him run!” says Sebastian.\r\n\r\n‘“On this you ride breakneck to me with a tale of pirates, and wool-wains,\r\nand cow-hides, which, though it hath moved my mirth as a man, offendeth my\r\nreason as a magistrate. So I will e’en accompany you back to the tower\r\nwith, perhaps, some few of my own people, and three to four wagons, and\r\nI’ll be your warrant that Master John Collins will freely give you your\r\nguns and your demi-cannon, Master Sebastian.” He breaks into his proper\r\nvoice—“I warned the old tod and his neighbours long ago that they’d come\r\nto trouble with their side-sellings and bye-dealings; but we cannot have\r\nhalf Sussex hanged for a little gun-running. Are ye content, lads?”\r\n\r\n‘“I’d commit any treason for two demi-cannon,” said Sebastian, and rubs\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n‘“Ye have just compounded with rank treason-felony for the same bribe,”\r\nsays Sir John. “Wherefore to horse, and get the guns.”’\r\n\r\n‘But Master Collins meant the guns for Sir Andrew Barton all along, didn’t\r\nhe?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Questionless, that he did,’ said Hal. ‘But he lost them. We poured into\r\nthe village on the red edge of dawn, Sir John horsed, in half-armour, his\r\npennon flying; behind him thirty stout Brightling knaves, five abreast;\r\nbehind them four wool-wains, and behind them four trumpets to triumph over\r\nthe jest, blowing: _Our King went forth to Normandie_. When we halted and\r\nrolled the ringing guns out of the tower, ’twas for all the world like\r\nFriar Roger’s picture of the French siege in the Queen’s Missal-book.’\r\n\r\n‘And what did we—I mean, what did our village do?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Oh! Bore it nobly—nobly,’ cried Hal. ‘Though they had tricked me, I was\r\nproud of us. They came out of their housen, looked at that little army as\r\nthough it had been a post, and went their shut-mouthed way. Never a sign!\r\nNever a word! They’d ha’ perished sooner than let Brightling overcrow us.\r\nEven that villain, Ticehurst Will, coming out of the Bell for his morning\r\nale, he all but ran under Sir John’s horse.\r\n\r\n‘“Ware, Sirrah Devil!” cries Sir John, reining back.\r\n\r\n‘“Oh!” says Will. “Market day, is it? And all the bullocks from Brightling\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n‘I spared him his belting for that—the brazen knave!\r\n\r\n‘But John Collins was our masterpiece! He happened along-street (his jaw\r\ntied up where Sebastian had clouted him) when we were trundling the first\r\ndemi-cannon through the lych-gate.\r\n\r\n‘“I reckon you’ll find her middlin’ heavy,” he says. “If you’ve a mind to\r\npay, I’ll loan ye my timber-tug. She won’t lie easy on ary wool-wain.”\r\n\r\n‘That was the one time I ever saw Sebastian taken flat aback. He opened\r\nand shut his mouth, fishy-like.\r\n\r\n‘“No offence,” says Master John. “You’ve got her reasonable good cheap. I\r\nthought ye might not grudge me a groat if I help move her.” Ah, he was a\r\nmasterpiece! They say that morning’s work cost our John two hundred\r\npounds, and he never winked an eyelid, not even when he saw the guns all\r\ncarted off to Lewes.’\r\n\r\n‘Neither then nor later?’ said Puck.\r\n\r\n‘Once. ’Twas after he gave St. Barnabas the new chime of bells. (Oh, there\r\nwas nothing the Collinses, or the Hayes, or the Fowles, or the Fanners\r\nwould not do for the church then! “Ask and have” was their song.) We had\r\nrung ’em in, and he was in the tower with Black Nick Fowle, that gave us\r\nour rood-screen. The old man pinches the bell-rope one hand and scratches\r\nhis neck with t’other. “Sooner she was pulling yon clapper than my neck,”\r\nhe says. That was all! That was Sussex—seely Sussex for everlastin’!’\r\n\r\n‘And what happened after?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘I went back into England,’ said Hal, slowly. ‘I’d had my lesson against\r\npride. But they tell me I left St. Barnabas’s a jewel—just about a jewel!\r\nWel-a-well! ’Twas done for and among my own people, and—Father Roger was\r\nright—I never knew such trouble or such triumph since. That’s the nature\r\no’ things. A dear—dear land.’ He dropped his chin on his chest.\r\n\r\n‘There’s your Father at the Forge. What’s he talking to old Hobden about?’\r\nsaid Puck, opening his hand with three leaves in it.\r\n\r\nDan looked towards the cottage.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, I know. It’s that old oak lying across the brook. Pater always wants\r\nit grubbed.’\r\n\r\nIn the still valley they could hear old Hobden’s deep tones.\r\n\r\n‘Have it _as_ you’ve a mind to,’ he was saying. ‘But the vivers of her\r\nroots they hold the bank together. If you grub her out, the bank she’ll\r\nall come tearin’ down, an’ next floods the brook’ll swarve up. But have it\r\n_as_ you’ve a mind. The mistuss she sets a heap by the ferns on her\r\ntrunk.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! I’ll think it over,’ said the Pater.\r\n\r\nUna laughed a little bubbling chuckle.\r\n\r\n‘What Devil’s in _that_ belfry?’ said Hal, with a lazy laugh. ‘That should\r\nbe Hobden by his voice.’\r\n\r\n‘Why, the oak is the regular bridge for all the rabbits between the Three\r\nAcre and our meadow. The best place for wires on the farm, Hobden says.\r\nHe’s got two there now,’ Una answered. ‘_He_ won’t ever let it be\r\ngrubbed!’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, Sussex! Silly Sussex for everlastin’,’ murmured Hal; and the next\r\nmoment their Father’s voice calling across to Little Lindens broke the\r\nspell as St. Barnabas’s clock struck five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMUGGLERS’ SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n  _If you wake at midnight, and hear a horse’s feet,_\r\n  _Don’t go drawing back the blind, or looking in the street,_\r\n  _Them that asks no questions isn’t told a lie._\r\n  _Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!_\r\n\r\n      _Five and twenty ponies_\r\n      _Trotting through the dark;_\r\n      _Brandy for the Parson,_\r\n      _’Baccy for the Clerk_\r\n      _Laces for a lady, letters for a spy,_\r\n\r\n  _And watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!_\r\n\r\n  _Running round the woodlump if you chance to find_\r\n  _Little barrels, roped and tarred, all full of brandywined;_\r\n  _Don’t you shout to come and look, nor take ’em for your play;_\r\n  _Put the brishwood back again,—and they’ll be gone next day!_\r\n\r\n  _If you see the stableyard setting open wide;_\r\n  _If you see a tied horse lying down inside;_\r\n  _If your mother mends a coat cut about and tore;_\r\n  _If the lining’s wet and warm—don’t you ask no more!_\r\n\r\n  _If you meet King George’s men, dressed in blue and red,_\r\n  _You be careful what you say, and mindful what is said._\r\n  _If they call you ’pretty maid,’ and chuck you ’neath the chin,_\r\n  _Don’t you tell where no one is, nor yet where no one’s been!_\r\n\r\n  _Knocks and footsteps round the house—whistles after dark—_\r\n  _You’ve no call for running out till the house-dogs bark._\r\n  Trusty’s _here, and_ Pincher’s _here, and see how dumb they lie—_\r\n  _They don’t fret to follow when the Gentlemen go by!_\r\n\r\n  _If you do as you’ve been told, likely there’s a chance,_\r\n  _You’ll be give a dainty doll, all the way from France,_\r\n  _With a cap of Valenciennes, and a velvet hood—_\r\n  _A present from the Gentlemen, along o’ being good!_\r\n\r\n      _Five and twenty ponies,_\r\n      _Trotting through the Park—_\r\n      _Brandy for the Parson,_\r\n      _’Baccy for the Clerk._\r\n\r\n  _Them that asks no questions isn’t told a lie._\r\n  _Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘DYMCHURCH FLIT’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEE BOY’S SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bees!

The\r\nmothers wheeled the bouncing perambulators out of the gardens; bins were\r\nput away, and tally-books made up. The young couples strolled home, two to\r\neach umbrella, and the single men walked behind them laughing. Dan and\r\nUna, who had been picking after their lessons, marched off to roast\r\npotatoes at the oast-house, where old Hobden, with Blue-eyed Bess, his\r\nlurcher-dog, lived all the month through, drying the hops.\r\n\r\nThey settled themselves, as usual, on the sack-strewn cot in front of the\r\nfires, and, when Hobden drew up the shutter, stared, as usual, at the\r\nflameless bed of coals spouting its heat up the dark well of the\r\nold-fashioned roundel. Slowly he cracked off a few fresh pieces of coal,\r\npacked them, with fingers that never flinched, exactly where they would do\r\nmost good; slowly he reached behind him till Dan tilted the potatoes into\r\nhis iron scoop of a hand; carefully he arranged them round the fire, and\r\nthen stood for a moment, black against the glare. As he closed the\r\nshutter, the oast-house seemed dark before the day’s end, and he lit the\r\ncandle in the lanthorn. The children liked all these things because they\r\nknew them so well.\r\n\r\nThe Bee Boy, Hobden’s son, who is not quite right in his head, though he\r\ncan do anything with bees, slipped in like a shadow. They only guessed it\r\nwhen Bess’s stump-tail wagged against them.\r\n\r\nA big voice began singing outside in the drizzle:—\r\n\r\n  ‘Old Mother Laidinwool had nigh twelve months been dead,\r\n  She heard the hops were doing well, and then popped up her head.’\r\n\r\n‘There can’t be two people made to holler like that!’ cried old Hobden,\r\nwheeling round.\r\n\r\n  ‘For, says she, “The boys I’ve picked with when I was young and fair,\r\n  They’re bound to be at hoppin’, and I’m——”’\r\n\r\nA man showed at the doorway.\r\n\r\n‘Well, well! They do say hoppin’ll draw the very deadest; and now I\r\nbelieft ’em. You, Tom? Tom Shoesmith!’ Hobden lowered his lanthorn.\r\n\r\n‘You’re a hem of a time makin’ your mind to it, Ralph!’ The stranger\r\nstrode in—three full inches taller than Hobden, a grey-whiskered,\r\nbrown-faced giant with clear blue eyes. They shook hands, and the children\r\ncould hear the hard palms rasp together.\r\n\r\n‘You ain’t lost none o’ your grip,’ said Hobden. ‘Was it thirty or forty\r\nyear back you broke my head at Peasmarsh Fair?’\r\n\r\n‘Only thirty, an’ no odds ’tween us regardin’ heads, neither. You had it\r\nback at me with a hop-pole. How did we get home that night? Swimmin’?’\r\n\r\n‘Same way the pheasant come into Gubbs’s pocket—by a little luck an’ a\r\ndeal o’ conjurin’.’ Old Hobden laughed in his deep chest.\r\n\r\n‘I see you’ve not forgot your way about the woods. D’ye do any o’ _this_\r\nstill?’ The stranger pretended to look along a gun.\r\n\r\nHobden answered with a quick movement of the hand as though he were\r\npegging down a rabbit-wire.\r\n\r\n‘No. _That’s_ all that’s left me now. Age she must as Age she can. An’\r\nwhat’s your news since all these years?’\r\n\r\n  ‘Oh, I’ve bin to Plymouth, I’ve bin to Dover—\r\n  I’ve bin ramblin’, boys, the wide world over,’\r\n\r\nthe man answered cheerily. ‘I reckon I know as much of Old England as\r\nmost.’ He turned towards the children and winked boldly.\r\n\r\n‘I lay they told you a sight o’ lies, then. I’ve been into England fur as\r\nWiltsheer once. I was cheated proper over a pair of hedging-gloves,’ said\r\nHobden.\r\n\r\n‘There’s fancy-talkin’ everywhere. _You’ve_ cleaved to your own parts\r\npretty middlin’ close, Ralph.’\r\n\r\n‘Can’t shift an old tree ’thout it dyin’,’ Hobden chuckled. ‘An’ I be no\r\nmore anxious to die than you look to be to help me with my hops to-night.’\r\n\r\nThe great man leaned against the brickwork of the roundel, and swung his\r\narms abroad. ‘Hire me!’ was all he said, and they stumped upstairs\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nThe children heard their shovels rasp on the cloth where the yellow hops\r\nlie drying above the fires, and all the oast-house filled with the sweet,\r\nsleepy smell as they were turned.\r\n\r\n‘Who is it?’ Una whispered to the Bee Boy.\r\n\r\n‘Dunno, no more’n you—if _you_ dunno,’ said he, and smiled.\r\n\r\nThe voices on the drying-floor talked and chuckled together, and the heavy\r\nfootsteps went back and forth. Presently a hop-pocket dropped through the\r\npress-hole overhead, and stiffened and fattened as they shovelled it full.\r\n‘Clank!’ went the press, and rammed the loose stuff into tight cake.\r\n\r\n‘Gently!’ they heard Hobden cry. ‘You’ll bust her crop if you lay on so.\r\nYou be as careless as Gleason’s bull, Tom. Come an’ sit by the fires.\r\nShe’ll do now.’\r\n\r\nThey came down, and as Hobden opened the shutter to see if the potatoes\r\nwere done Tom Shoesmith said to the children, ‘Put a plenty salt on ’em.\r\nThat’ll show you the sort o’ man _I_ be.’ Again he winked, and again the\r\nBee Boy laughed and Una stared at Dan.\r\n\r\n‘_I_ know what sort o’ man you be,’ old Hobden grunted, groping for the\r\npotatoes round the fire.\r\n\r\n‘Do ye?’ Tom went on behind his back. ‘Some of us can’t abide Horseshoes,\r\nor Church Bells, or Running Water; an’, talkin’ o’ runnin’ water’—he\r\nturned to Hobden, who was backing out of the roundel—‘d’you mind the great\r\nfloods at Robertsbridge, when the miller’s man was drowned in the street?’\r\n\r\n‘Middlin’ well.’ Old Hobden let himself down on the coals by the fire\r\ndoor. ‘I was courtin’ my woman on the Marsh that year. Carter to Mus’ Plum\r\nI was—gettin’ ten shillin’s week. Mine was a Marsh woman.’\r\n\r\n‘Won’erful odd-gates place—Romney Marsh,’ said Tom Shoesmith. ‘I’ve heard\r\nsay the world’s divided like into Europe, Ashy, Afriky, Ameriky, Australy,\r\nan’ Romney Marsh.’\r\n\r\n‘The Marsh folk think so,’ said Hobden. ‘I had a hem o’ trouble to get my\r\nwoman to leave it.’\r\n\r\n‘Where did she come out of? I’ve forgot, Ralph.’\r\n\r\n‘Dymchurch under the Wall,’ Hobden answered, a potato in his hand.\r\n\r\n‘Then she’d be a Pett—or a Whitgift, would she?’\r\n\r\n‘Whitgift.’ Hobden broke open the potato and ate it with the curious\r\nneatness of men who make most of their meals in the blowy open. ‘She\r\ngrowed to be quite reasonable-like after livin’ in the Weald awhile, but\r\nour first twenty year or two she was odd-fashioned, no bounds. And she was\r\na won’erful hand with bees.’ He cut away a little piece of potato and\r\nthrew it out to the door.\r\n\r\n‘Ah! I’ve heard say the Whitgifts could see further through a millstone\r\nthan most,’ said Shoesmith. ‘Did she, now?’\r\n\r\n‘She was honest-innocent, of any nigromancin’,’ said Hobden. ‘Only she’d\r\nread signs and sinnifications out o’ birds flyin’, stars fallin’, bees\r\nhivin’, and such. An’ she’d lie awake—listenin’ for calls, she said.’\r\n\r\n‘That don’t prove naught,’ said Tom. ‘All Marsh folk has been smugglers\r\nsince time everlastin’. ’Twould be in her blood to listen out o’ nights.’\r\n\r\n‘Nature-ally,’ old Hobden replied, smiling. ‘I mind when there was\r\nsmugglin’ a sight nearer us than the Marsh be. But that wasn’t my woman’s\r\ntrouble. ’Twas a passel o’ no-sense talk,’ he dropped his voice, ‘about\r\nPharisees.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes. I’ve heard Marsh men beleft in ’em.’ Tom looked straight at the\r\nwide-eyed children beside Bess.\r\n\r\n‘Pharisees,’ cried Una. ‘Fairies? Oh, I see!’\r\n\r\n‘People o’ the Hills,’ said the Bee Boy, throwing half of his potato\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n‘There you be!’ said Hobden, pointing at him. ‘My boy, he has her eyes and\r\nher out-gate senses. That’s what _she_ called ’em!’\r\n\r\n‘And what did you think of it all?’\r\n\r\n‘Um—um,’ Hobden rumbled. ‘A man that uses fields an’ shaws after dark as\r\nmuch as I’ve done, he don’t go out of his road excep’ for keepers.’\r\n\r\n‘But settin’ that aside?’ said Tom, coaxingly. ‘I saw ye throw the Good\r\nPiece out-at doors just now. Do ye believe or—_do_ ye?’\r\n\r\n‘There was a great black eye to that tater,’ said Hobden, indignantly.\r\n\r\n‘My liddle eye didn’t see un, then. It looked as if you meant it for—for\r\nAny One that might need it. But settin’ that aside. D’ye believe or—_do_\r\nye?’\r\n\r\n‘I ain’t sayin’ nothin’, because I’ve heard naught, an’ I’ve seen naught.\r\nBut if you was to say there was more things after dark in the shaws than\r\nmen, or fur, or feather, or fin, I dunno as I’d go farabout to call you a\r\nliar. Now turn again, Tom. What’s your say?’\r\n\r\n‘I’m like you. I say nothin’. But I’ll tell you a tale, an’ you can fit it\r\n_as_ how you please.’\r\n\r\n‘Passel o’ no-sense stuff,’ growled Hobden, but he filled his pipe.\r\n\r\n‘The Marsh men they call it Dymchurch Flit,’ Tom went on slowly. ‘Hap\r\nyou’ve heard it?’\r\n\r\n‘My woman she’ve told it me scores o’ times. Dunno as I didn’t end by\r\nbelieft in’ it—sometimes.’\r\n\r\nHobden crossed over as he spoke, and sucked with his pipe at the yellow\r\nlanthorn-flame. Tom rested one great elbow on one great knee, where he sat\r\namong the coal.\r\n\r\n‘Have you ever bin in the Marsh?’ he said to Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Only as far as Rye, once,’ Dan answered.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, that’s but the edge. Back behind of her there’s steeples settin’\r\nbeside churches, an’ wise women settin’ beside their doors, an’ the sea\r\nsettin’ above the land, an’ ducks herdin’ wild in the diks’ (he meant\r\nditches). ‘The Marsh is justabout riddled with diks an’ sluices, an’\r\ntide-gates an’ water-lets. You can hear em’ bubblin’ an’ grummelin’ when\r\nthe tide works in em’, an’ then you hear the sea rangin’ left and\r\nright-handed all up along the Wall. You’ve seen how flat she is—the Marsh?\r\nYou’d think nothin’ easier than to walk eend-on acrost her? Ah, but the\r\ndiks an’ the water-lets, they twists the roads about as ravelly as\r\nwitch-yarn on the spindles. So ye get all turned round in broad daylight.’\r\n\r\n‘That’s because they’ve dreened the waters into the diks,’ said Hobden.\r\n‘When I courted my woman the rushes was green—Eh me! the rushes was\r\ngreen—an’ the Bailiff o’ the Marshes, he rode up and down as free as the\r\nfog.’\r\n\r\n‘Who was he?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Why, the Marsh fever an’ ague. He’ve clapped me on the shoulder once or\r\ntwice till I shook proper. But now the dreenin’ off of the waters have\r\ndone away with the fevers; so they make a joke, like, that the Bailiff o’\r\nthe Marshes broke his neck in a dik. A won’erful place for bees an’ ducks\r\n’tis too.’\r\n\r\n‘An’ old!’ Tom went on. ‘Flesh an’ Blood have been there since Time\r\nEverlastin’ Beyond. Well, now, speakin’ among themselves, the Marshmen say\r\nthat from Time Everlastin’ Beyond the Pharisees favoured the Marsh above\r\nthe rest of Old England. I lay the Marshmen ought to know. They’ve been\r\nout after dark, father an’ son, smugglin’ some one thing or t’other, since\r\never wool grew to sheep’s backs. They say there was always a middlin’ few\r\nPharisees to be seen on the Marsh. Impident as rabbits, they was. They’d\r\ndance on the nakid roads in the nakid daytime; they’d flash their liddle\r\ngreen lights along the diks, comin’ an’ goin’, like honest smugglers. Yes,\r\nan’ times they’d lock the church doors against parson an’ clerk of\r\nSundays!’\r\n\r\n‘That ’ud be smugglers layin’ in the lace or the brandy till they could\r\nrun it out o’ the Marsh. I’ve told my woman so,’ said Hobden.\r\n\r\n‘I’ll lay she didn’t beleft it, then—not if she was a Whitgift. A\r\nwon’erful choice place for Pharisees, the Marsh, by all accounts, till\r\nQueen Bess’s father he come in with his Reformatories.’\r\n\r\n‘Would that be a Act o’ Parliament like?’ Hobden asked.\r\n\r\n‘Sure-ly! ’Can’t do nothing in Old England without Act, Warrant, an’\r\nSummons. He got his Act allowed him, an’, they say, Queen Bess’s father he\r\nused the parish churches something shameful. Justabout tore the gizzards\r\nout of I dunnamany. Some folk in England they held with ’en; but some they\r\nsaw it different, an’ it eended in ’em takin’ sides an’ burnin’ each other\r\nno bounds, accordin’ which side was top, time bein’. That tarrified the\r\nPharisees: for Goodwill among Flesh an’ Blood is meat an’ drink to ’em,\r\nan’ ill-will is poison.’\r\n\r\n‘Same as bees,’ said the Bee Boy. ‘Bees won’t stay by a house where\r\nthere’s hating.’\r\n\r\n‘True,’ said Tom. ‘This Reformations tarrified the Pharisees same as the\r\nreaper goin’ round a last stand o’ wheat tarrifies rabbits. They packed\r\ninto the Marsh from all parts, and they says, “Fair or foul, we must flit\r\nout o’ this, for Merry England’s done with, an’ we’re reckoned among the\r\nImages.”’\r\n\r\n‘Did they _all_ see it that way?’ said Hobden.\r\n\r\n‘All but one that was called Robin—if you’ve heard of him. What are you\r\nlaughing at?’ Tom turned to Dan. ‘The Pharisees’s trouble didn’t tech\r\nRobin, because he’d cleaved middlin’ close to people like. No more he\r\nnever meant to go out of Old England—not he; so he was sent messagin’ for\r\nhelp among Flesh an’ Blood. But Flesh an’ Blood must always think of their\r\nown concerns, an’ Robin couldn’t get _through_ at ’em, ye see. They\r\nthought it was tide-echoes off the Marsh.’\r\n\r\n‘What did you—what did the fai—Pharisees want?’ Una asked.\r\n\r\n‘A boat to be sure. Their liddle wings could no more cross Channel than so\r\nmany tired butterflies. A boat an’ a crew they desired to sail ’em over to\r\nFrance, where yet awhile folks hadn’t tore down the Images. They couldn’t\r\nabide cruel Canterbury Bells ringin’ to Bulverhithe for more pore men an’\r\nwomen to be burnded, nor the King’s proud messenger ridin’ through the\r\nland givin’ orders to tear down the Images. They couldn’t abide it no\r\nshape. Nor yet they couldn’t get their boat an’ crew to flit by without\r\nLeave an’ Good-will from Flesh an’ Blood; an’ Flesh an’ Blood came an’\r\nwent about its own business the while the Marsh was swarvin’ up, an’\r\nswarvin’ up with Pharisees from all England over, striving all means to\r\nget _through_ at Flesh an’ Blood to tell ’en their sore need.... I don’t\r\nknow as you’ve ever heard say Pharisees are like chickens?’\r\n\r\n‘My woman used to say that too,’ said Hobden, folding his brown arms.\r\n\r\n‘They be. You run too many chickens together, an’ the ground sickens like,\r\nan’ you get a squat, an’ your chickens die. ’Same way, you crowd Pharisees\r\nall in one place—_they_ don’t die, but Flesh an’ Blood walkin’ among ’em\r\nis apt to sick up an’ pine off. _They_ don’t mean it, an’ Flesh an’ Blood\r\ndon’t know it, but that’s the truth—as I’ve heard. The Pharisees through\r\nbein’ all stenched up an’ frighted, an’ tryin’ to come _through_ with\r\ntheir supplications, they nature-ally changed the thin airs and humours in\r\nFlesh an’ Blood. It lay on the Marsh like thunder. Men saw their churches\r\nablaze with the wildfire in the windows after dark; they saw their cattle\r\nscatterin’ and no man scarin’; their sheep flockin’ and no man drivin’;\r\ntheir horses latherin’ an’ no man leadin’; they saw the liddle low green\r\nlights more than ever in the dik-sides; they heard the liddle feet\r\npatterin’ more than ever round the houses; an’ night an’ day, day an’\r\nnight, ’twas all as though they were bein’ creeped up on, and hinted at by\r\nsome One or Other that couldn’t rightly shape their trouble. Oh, I lay\r\nthey sweated! Man an’ maid, woman an’ child, their Nature done ’em no\r\nservice all the weeks while the Marsh was swarvin’ up with Pharisees. But\r\nthey was Flesh an’ Blood, an’ Marsh men before all. They reckoned the\r\nsigns sinnified trouble for the Marsh. Or that the sea ’ud rear up against\r\nDymchurch Wall an’ they’d be drownded like Old Winchelsea; or that the\r\nPlague was comin’. So they looked for the meanin’ in the sea or in the\r\nclouds—far an’ high up. They never thought to look near an’ knee-high,\r\nwhere they could see naught.\r\n\r\n‘Now there was a poor widow at Dymchurch under the Wall, which, lacking\r\nman or property, she had the more time for feeling; and she come to feel\r\nthere was a Trouble outside her doorstep bigger an’ heavier than aught\r\nshe’d ever carried over it. She had two sons—one born blind, and t’other\r\nstruck dumb through fallin’ off the Wall when he was liddle. They was men\r\ngrown, but not wage-earnin’, an’ she worked for ’em, keepin’ bees and\r\nanswerin’ Questions.’\r\n\r\n‘What sort of questions?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘Like where lost things might be found, an’ what to put about a crooked\r\nbaby’s neck, an’ how to join parted sweethearts. She felt the Trouble on\r\nthe Marsh same as eels feel thunder. She was a wise woman.’\r\n\r\n‘My woman was won’erful weather-tender, too,’ said Hobden. ‘I’ve seen her\r\nbrish sparks like off an anvil out of her hair in thunderstorms. But she\r\nnever laid out to answer Questions.’\r\n\r\n‘This woman was a Seeker like, an’ Seekers they sometimes find. One night,\r\nwhile she lay abed, hot an’ aching, there come a Dream an’ tapped at her\r\nwindow, and “Widow Whitgift,” it said, “Widow Whitgift!”\r\n\r\n‘First, by the wings an’ the whistling, she thought it was peewits, but\r\nlast she arose an’ dressed herself, an’ opened her door to the Marsh, an’\r\nshe felt the Trouble an’ the Groaning all about her, strong as fever an’\r\nague, an’ she calls: “What is it? Oh, what is it?”\r\n\r\n‘Then ’twas all like the frogs in the diks peeping: then ’twas all like\r\nthe reeds in the diks clipclapping; an’ then the great Tide-wave rummelled\r\nalong the Wall, an’ she couldn’t hear proper.\r\n\r\n‘Three times she called, an’ three times the Tide-wave did her down. But\r\nshe catched the quiet between, an’ she cries out, “What is the Trouble on\r\nthe Marsh that’s been lying down with my heart an’ arising with my body\r\nthis month gone?” She felt a liddle hand lay hold on her gown-hem, an’ she\r\nstooped to the pull o’ that liddle hand.’\r\n\r\nTom Shoesmith spread his huge fist before the fire and smiled at it.\r\n\r\n‘“Will the sea drown the Marsh?” she says. She was a Marsh-woman first an’\r\nforemost.\r\n\r\n‘“No,” says the liddle voice. “Sleep sound for all o’ that.”\r\n\r\n‘“Is the Plague comin’ to the Marsh?” she says. Them was all the ills she\r\nknowed.\r\n\r\n‘“No. Sleep sound for all o’ that,” says Robin.\r\n\r\n‘She turned about, half mindful to go in, but the liddle voices grieved\r\nthat shrill an’ sorrowful she turns back, an’ she cries: “If it is not a\r\nTrouble of Flesh an’ Blood, what can I do?”\r\n\r\n‘The Pharisees cried out upon her from all round to fetch them a boat to\r\nsail to France, an’ come back no more.\r\n\r\n‘“There’s a boat on the Wall,” she says, “but I can’t push it down to the\r\nsea, nor sail it when ’tis there.”\r\n\r\n‘“Lend us your sons,” says all the Pharisees. “Give ’em Leave an’\r\nGood-will to sail it for us, Mother—O Mother!”\r\n\r\n‘“One’s dumb, an’ t’other’s blind,” she says. “But all the dearer me for\r\nthat; and you’ll lose them in the big sea.” The voices justabout pierced\r\nthrough her. An’ there was children’s voices too. She stood out all she\r\ncould, but she couldn’t rightly stand against _that_. So she says: “If you\r\ncan draw my sons for your job, I’ll not hinder ’em. You can’t ask no more\r\nof a Mother.”\r\n\r\n‘She saw them liddle green lights dance an’ cross till she was dizzy; she\r\nheard them liddle feet patterin’ by the thousand; she heard cruel\r\nCanterbury Bells ringing to Bulverhithe, an’ she heard the great Tide-wave\r\nranging along the Wall. That was while the Pharisees was workin’ a Dream\r\nto wake her two sons asleep: an’ while she bit on her fingers she saw them\r\ntwo she’d bore come out an’ pass her with never a word. She followed ’em,\r\ncryin’ pitiful, to the old boat on the Wall, an’ that they took an’ runned\r\ndown to the Sea.\r\n\r\n‘When they’d stepped mast an’ sail the blind son speaks up: “Mother, we’re\r\nwaitin’ your Leave an’ Good-will to take Them over.”’\r\n\r\nTom Shoesmith threw back his head and half shut his eyes.\r\n\r\n‘Eh, me!’ he said. ‘She was a fine, valiant woman, the Widow Whitgift. She\r\nstood twistin’ the ends of her long hair over her fingers, an’ she shook\r\nlike a poplar, makin’ up her mind. The Pharisees all about they hushed\r\ntheir children from cryin’ an’ they waited dumb-still. She was all their\r\ndependence. ’Thout her Leave an’ Goodwill they could not pass; for she was\r\nthe Mother. So she shook like a asp-tree makin’ up her mind. ’Last she\r\ndrives the word past her teeth, an’ “Go!” she says. “Go with my Leave an’\r\nGoodwill.”\r\n\r\n‘Then I saw—then, they say, she had to brace back same as if she was\r\nwadin’ in tide-water; for the Pharisees justabout flowed past her—down the\r\nbeach to the boat, _I_ dunnamany of ’em—with their wives an’ children an’\r\nvalooables, all escapin’ out of cruel Old England. Silver you could hear\r\nclinkin’, an’ liddle bundles hove down dunt on the bottom-boards, an’\r\npassels o’ liddle swords an’ shield’s raklin’, an’ liddle fingers an’ toes\r\nscratchin’ on the boatside to board her when the two sons pushed her off.\r\nThat boat she sunk lower an’ lower, but all the Widow could see in it was\r\nher boys movin’ hampered-like to get at the tackle. Up sail they did, an’\r\naway they went, deep as a Rye barge, away into the off-shore mistes, an’\r\nthe Widow Whitgift she sat down and eased her grief till mornin’ light.’\r\n\r\n‘I never heard she was _all_ alone,’ said Hobden.\r\n\r\n‘I remember now. The one called Robin he stayed with her, they tell. She\r\nwas all too grievious to listen to his promises.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah! She should ha’ made her bargain beforehand. I allus told my woman\r\nso!’ Hobden cried.\r\n\r\n‘No. She loaned her sons for a pure love-loan, bein’ as she sensed the\r\nTrouble on the Marshes, an’ was simple good-willing to ease it.’ Tom\r\nlaughed softly. ‘She done that. Yes, she done that! From Hithe to\r\nBulverthithe, fretty man an’ petty maid, ailin’ woman an’ wailin’ child,\r\nthey took the advantage of the change in the thin airs just about _as_\r\nsoon as the Pharisees flitted. Folks come out fresh an’ shining all over\r\nthe Marsh like snails after wet. An’ that while the Widow Whitgift sat\r\ngrievin’ on the Wall. She might have beleft us—she might have trusted her\r\nsons would be sent back! She fussed, no bounds, when their boat come in\r\nafter three days.’\r\n\r\n‘And, of course, the sons were both quite cured?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘No-o. That would have been out o’ Nature. She got ’em back _as_ she sent\r\n’em. The blind man he hadn’t seen naught of anything, an’ the dumb man\r\nnature-ally, he couldn’t say aught of what he’d seen. I reckon that was\r\nwhy the Pharisees pitched on ’em for the ferrying job.’\r\n\r\n‘But what did you—what did Robin promise the Widow?’ said Dan.\r\n\r\n‘What _did_ he promise, now?’ Tom pretended to think. ‘Wasn’t your woman a\r\nWhitgift, Ralph? Didn’t she say?’\r\n\r\n‘She told me a passel o’ no-sense stuff when he was born.’ Hobden pointed\r\nat his son. ‘There was always to be one of ’em that could see further into\r\na millstone than most.’\r\n\r\n‘Me! That’s me!’ said the Bee Boy so suddenly that they all laughed.\r\n\r\n‘I’ve got it now!’ cried Tom, slapping his knee. ‘So long as Whitgift\r\nblood lasted, Robin promised there would allers be one o’ her stock\r\nthat—that no Trouble ’ud lie on, no Maid ’ud sigh on, no Night could\r\nfrighten, no Fright could harm, no Harm could make sin, an’ no Woman could\r\nmake a fool.’\r\n\r\n‘Well, ain’t that just me?’ said the Bee Boy, where he sat in the silver\r\nsquare of the great September moon that was staring into the oast-house\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n‘They was the exact words she told me when we first found he wasn’t like\r\nothers. But it beats me how you known ’em,’ said Hobden.\r\n\r\n‘Aha! There’s more under my hat besides hair!’ Tom laughed and stretched\r\nhimself. ‘When I’ve seen these two young folk home, we’ll make a night of\r\nold days, Ralph, with passin’ old tales—eh? An’ where might you live?’ he\r\nsaid, gravely, to Dan. ‘An’ do you think your Pa ’ud give me a drink for\r\ntakin’ you there, Missy?’\r\n\r\nThey giggled so at this that they had to run out. Tom picked them both up,\r\nset one on each broad shoulder, and tramped across the ferny pasture where\r\nthe cows puffed milky puffs at them in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Puck! Puck! I guessed you right from when you talked about the salt.\r\nHow could you ever do it?’ Una cried, swinging along delighted.\r\n\r\n‘Do what?’ he said, and climbed the stile by the pollard oak.\r\n\r\n‘Pretend to be Tom Shoesmith,’ said Dan, and they ducked to avoid the two\r\nlittle ashes that grow by the bridge over the brook. Tom was almost\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\n‘Yes. That’s my name, Mus’ Dan,’ he said, hurrying over the silent shining\r\nlawn, where a rabbit sat by the big white-thorn near the croquet ground.\r\n‘Here you be.’ He strode into the old kitchen yard, and slid them down as\r\nEllen came to ask questions.\r\n\r\n‘I’m helping in Mus’ Spray’s oast-house,’ he said to her. ‘No, I’m no\r\nforeigner. I knowed this country ’fore your Mother was born; an’—yes it’s\r\ndry work oasting, Miss. Thank you.’\r\n\r\nEllen went to get a jug, and the children went in—magicked once more by\r\nOak, Ash, and Thorn!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA THREE-PART SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n  _I’m just in love with all these three,_\r\n  _The Weald and the Marsh and the Down countrie;_\r\n  _Nor I don’t know which I love the most,_\r\n  _The Weald or the Marsh or the white chalk coast!_\r\n\r\n  _I’ve buried my heart in a ferny hill,_\r\n  _Twix’ a liddle low Shaw an’ a great high Gill._\r\n  _Oh hop-vine yaller and woodsmoke blue,_\r\n  _I reckon you’ll keep her middling true!_\r\n\r\n  _I’ve loosed my mind for to out and run,_\r\n  _On a Marsh that was old when Kings begun;_\r\n  _Oh Romney Level and Brenzett reeds,_\r\n  _I reckon you know what my mind needs!_\r\n\r\n  _I’ve given my soul to the Southdown grass,_\r\n  _And sheep-bells tinkled where you pass._\r\n  _Oh Firle an’ Ditchling an’ sails at sea,_\r\n  _I reckon you’ll keep my soul or me!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURE AND THE LAW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG OF THE FIFTH RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\n  _When first by Eden Tree,_\r\n  _The Four Great Rivers ran,_\r\n  _To each was appointed a Man_\r\n  _Her Prince and Ruler to be._\r\n\r\n  _But after this was ordained,_\r\n  _(The ancient legends tell),_\r\n  _There came dark Israel,_\r\n  _For whom no River remained._\r\n\r\n  _Then He That is Wholly Just,_\r\n  _Said to him: ‘Fling on the ground_\r\n  _A handful of yellow dust,_\r\n  _And a Fifth Great River shall run,_\r\n  _Mightier than these Four,_\r\n  _In secret the Earth around;_\r\n  _And Her secret evermore,_\r\n  _Shall be shown to thee and thy Race.’_\r\n\r\n  _So it was said and done._\r\n  _And, deep in the veins of Earth,_\r\n  _And, fed by a thousand springs_\r\n  _That comfort the market-place,_\r\n  _Or sap the power of Kings,_\r\n  _The Fifth Great River had birth,_\r\n  _Even as it was foretold—_\r\n  _The Secret River of Gold!_\r\n\r\n  _And Israel laid down_\r\n  _His sceptre and his crown,_\r\n  _To brood on that River bank,_\r\n  _Where the waters flashed and sank,_\r\n  _And burrowed in earth and fell,_\r\n  _And bided a season below;_\r\n  _For reason that none might know,_\r\n  _Save only Israel._\r\n\r\n  _He is Lord of the Last—_\r\n  _The Fifth, most wonderful, Flood._\r\n  _He hears her thunder past_\r\n  _And Her Song is in his blood._\r\n  _He can foresay: ‘She will fall,’_\r\n  _For he knows which fountain dries,_\r\n  _Behind which desert belt_\r\n  _A thousand leagues to the South._\r\n  _He can foresay: ‘She will rise.’_\r\n  _He knows what far snows melt;_\r\n  _Along what mountain wall_\r\n  _A thousand leagues to the North._\r\n  _He snuffs the coming drouth_\r\n  _As he snuffs the coming rain,_\r\n  _He knows what each will bring forth_\r\n  _And turns it to his gain._\r\n\r\n  _A Prince without a Sword,_\r\n  _A Ruler without a Throne;_\r\n  _Israel follows his quest:—_\r\n  _In every land a guest._\r\n  _Of many lands the lord._\r\n  _In no land King is he._\r\n  _But the Fifth Great River keeps_\r\n  _The secret of her deeps_\r\n  _For Israel alone,_\r\n  _As it was ordered to be._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURE AND THE LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it was the third week in November, and the woods rang with the noise\r\nof pheasant-shooting. No one hunted that steep, cramped country except the\r\nvillage beagles, who, as often as not, escaped from their kennels and made\r\na day of their own. Dan and Una found a couple of them towling round the\r\nkitchen-garden after the laundry cat. The little brutes were only too\r\npleased to go rabbiting, so the children ran them all along the brook\r\npastures and into Little Lindens farm-yard, where the old sow vanquished\r\nthem—and up to the quarry-hole, where they started a fox. He headed for\r\nFar Wood, and there they frightened out all the pheasants who were\r\nsheltering from a big beat across the valley. Then the cruel guns began\r\nagain, and they grabbed the beagles lest they should stray and get hurt.\r\n\r\n‘I wouldn’t be a pheasant—in November—for a lot,’ Dan panted, as he caught\r\n_Folly_ by the neck. ‘Why did you laugh that horrid way?’\r\n\r\n‘I didn’t,’ said Una, sitting on _Flora_, the fat lady-dog. ‘Oh, look! The\r\nsilly birds are going back to their own woods instead of ours, where they\r\nwould be safe.’\r\n\r\n‘Safe till it pleased you to kill them.’ An old man, so tall he was almost\r\na giant, stepped from behind the clump of hollies by ‘Volaterrae.’ The\r\nchildren jumped, and the dogs dropped like setters. He wore a sweeping\r\ngown of dark thick stuff, lined and edged with yellowish fur, and he bowed\r\na bent-down bow that made them feel both proud and ashamed. Then he looked\r\nat them steadily, and they stared back without doubt or fear.\r\n\r\n‘You are not afraid?’ he said, running his hands through his splendid grey\r\nbeard. ‘Not afraid that those men yonder’—he jerked his head towards the\r\nincessant pop-pop of the guns from the lower woods—‘will do you hurt?’\r\n\r\n‘We-ell’—Dan liked to be accurate, especially when he was shy—‘old Hobd—a\r\nfriend of mine told me that one of the beaters got peppered last week—hit\r\nin the leg, I mean. You see, Mr. Meyer _will_ fire at rabbits. But he gave\r\nWaxy Garnett a quid—sovereign, I mean—and Waxy told Hobden he’d have stood\r\nboth barrels for half the money.’\r\n\r\n‘He doesn’t understand,’ Una cried, watching the pale, troubled face. ‘Oh,\r\nI wish——’\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely said it when Puck rustled out of the hollies and spoke to\r\nthe man quickly in foreign words. Puck wore a long cloak too—the afternoon\r\nwas just frosting down—and it changed his appearance altogether.\r\n\r\n‘Nay, nay!’ he said at last. ‘You did not understand the boy. A freeman\r\nwas a little hurt, by pure mischance, at the hunting.’\r\n\r\n‘I know that mischance! What did his Lord do? Laugh and ride over him?’\r\nthe old man sneered.\r\n\r\n‘It was one of your own people did the hurt, Kadmiel.’ Puck’s eyes\r\ntwinkled maliciously. ‘So he gave the freeman a piece of gold, and no more\r\nwas said.’\r\n\r\n‘A Jew drew blood from a Christian and no more was said?’ Kadmiel cried.\r\n‘Never! When did they torture him?’\r\n\r\n‘No man may be bound, or fined, or slain till he has been judged by his\r\npeers,’ Puck insisted. ‘There is but one Law in Old England for Jew or\r\nChristian—the Law that was signed at Runnymede.’\r\n\r\n‘Why, that’s Magna Charta!’ Dan whispered. It was one of the few history\r\ndates that he could remember. Kadmiel turned on him with a sweep and a\r\nwhirr of his spicy-scented gown.\r\n\r\n‘Dost _thou_ know of that, babe?’ he cried, and lifted his hands in\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said Dan, firmly.\r\n\r\n  ‘Magna Charta was signed by John,\r\n  That Henry the Third put his heel upon.\r\n\r\nAnd old Hobden says that if it hadn’t been for her (he calls everything\r\n“her,” you know), the keepers would have him clapped in Lewes Gaol all the\r\nyear round.’\r\n\r\nAgain Puck translated to Kadmiel in the strange, solemn-sounding language,\r\nand at last Kadmiel laughed.\r\n\r\n‘Out of the mouths of babes do we learn,’ said he. ‘But tell me now, and I\r\nwill not call you a babe but a Rabbi, _why_ did the King sign the roll of\r\nthe New Law at Runnymede? For he was a King.’\r\n\r\nDan looked sideways at his sister. It was her turn.\r\n\r\n‘Because he jolly well had to,’ said Una, softly. ‘The Barons made him.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay,’ Kadmiel answered, shaking his head. ‘You Christians always forget\r\nthat gold does more than the sword. Our good King signed because he could\r\nnot borrow more money from us bad Jews.’ He curved his shoulders as he\r\nspoke. ‘A King without gold is a snake with a broken back, and’—his nose\r\nsneered up and his eyebrows frowned down—‘it is a good deed to break a\r\nsnake’s back. That was _my_ work,’ he cried, triumphantly, to Puck.\r\n‘Spirit of Earth, bear witness that that was my work!’ He shot up to his\r\nfull towering height, and his words rang like a trumpet. He had a voice\r\nthat changed its tone almost as an opal changes colour—sometimes deep and\r\nthundery, sometimes thin and waily, but always it made you listen.\r\n\r\n‘Many people can bear witness to that,’ Puck answered. ‘Tell these babes\r\nhow it was done. Remember, Master, they do not know Doubt or Fear.’\r\n\r\n‘So I saw in their faces when we met,’ said Kadmiel. ‘Yet surely, surely\r\nthey are taught to spit upon Jews?’\r\n\r\n‘Are they?’ said Dan, much interested. ‘Where at?’\r\n\r\nPuck fell back a pace, laughing. ‘Kadmiel is thinking of King John’s\r\nreign,’ he explained. ‘His people were badly treated then.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, we know _that_,’ they answered, and (it was very rude of them, but\r\nthey could not help it) they stared straight at Kadmiel’s mouth to see if\r\nhis teeth were all there. It stuck in their lesson-memory that King John\r\nused to pull out Jews’ teeth to make them lend him money.\r\n\r\nKadmiel understood the look and smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\n‘No. Your King never drew my teeth: I think, perhaps, I drew his. Listen!\r\nI was not born among Christians, but among Moors—in Spain—in a little\r\nwhite town under the mountains. Yes, the Moors are cruel, but at least\r\ntheir learned men dare to think. It was prophesied of me at my birth that\r\nI should be a Lawgiver to a People of a strange speech and a hard\r\nlanguage. We Jews are always looking for the Prince and the Lawgiver to\r\ncome. Why not? My people in the town (we were very few) set me apart as a\r\nchild of the prophecy—the Chosen of the Chosen. We Jews dream so many\r\ndreams. You would never guess it to see us slink about the rubbish-heaps\r\nin our quarter; but at the day’s end—doors shut, candles lit—aha! _then_\r\nwe become the Chosen again.’\r\n\r\nHe paced back and forth through the wood as he talked. The rattle of the\r\nshot-guns never ceased, and the dogs whimpered a little and lay flat on\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\n‘I was a Prince. Yes! Think of a little Prince who had never known rough\r\nwords in his own house handed over to shouting, bearded Rabbis, who pulled\r\nhis ears and filliped his nose, all that he might learn—learn—learn to be\r\nKing when his time came. Hé! Such a little Prince it was! One eye he kept\r\non the stone-throwing Moorish boys, and the other it roved about the\r\nstreets looking for his Kingdom. Yes, and he learned to cry softly when he\r\nwas hunted up and down those streets. He learned to do all things without\r\nnoise. He played beneath his father’s table when the Great Candle was lit,\r\nand he listened as children listen to the talk of his father’s friends\r\nabove the table. They came across the mountains, from out of all the\r\nworld; for my Prince’s father was their councillor. They came from behind\r\nthe armies of Sala-ud-Din: from Rome: from Venice: from England. They\r\nstole down our alley, they tapped secretly at our door, they took off\r\ntheir rags, they arrayed themselves, and they talked to my father at the\r\nwine. All over the world the heathen fought each other. They brought news\r\nof these wars, and while he played beneath the table, my Prince heard\r\nthese meanly-dressed ones decide between themselves how, and when, and for\r\nhow long King should draw sword against King, and People rise up against\r\nPeople. Why not? There can be no war without gold, and we Jews know how\r\nthe earth’s gold moves with the seasons, and the crops, and the winds;\r\ncircling and looping and rising and sinking away like a river—a wonderful\r\nunderground river. How should the foolish Kings know _that_ while they\r\nfight and steal and kill?’\r\n\r\nThe children’s faces showed that they knew nothing at all as, with open\r\neyes, they trotted and turned beside the long-striding old man. He\r\ntwitched his gown over his shoulders, and a square plate of gold, studded\r\nwith jewels, gleamed for an instant through the fur, like a star through\r\nflying snow.\r\n\r\n‘No matter,’ he said. ‘But, credit me, my Prince saw peace or war decided\r\nnot once, but many times, by the fall of a coin spun between a Jew from\r\nBury and a Jewess from Alexandria, in his father’s house, when the Great\r\nCandle was lit. Such power had we Jews among the Gentiles. Ah, my little\r\nPrince! Do you wonder that he learned quickly? Why not?’ He muttered to\r\nhimself and went on:—\r\n\r\n‘My trade was that of a physician. When I had learned it in Spain I went\r\nto the East to find my Kingdom. Why not? A Jew is as free as a sparrow—or\r\na dog. He goes where he is hunted. In the East I found libraries where men\r\ndared to think—schools of medicine where they dared to learn. I was\r\ndiligent in my business. Therefore I stood before Kings. I have been a\r\nbrother to Princes and a companion to beggars, and I have walked between\r\nthe living and the dead. There was no profit in it. I did not find my\r\nKingdom. So, in the tenth year of my travels, when I had reached the\r\nUttermost Eastern Sea, I returned to my father’s house. God had\r\nwonderfully preserved my people. None had been slain, none even wounded,\r\nand only a few scourged. I became once more a son in my father’s house.\r\nAgain the Great Candle was lit; again the meanly-apparelled ones tapped on\r\nour door after dusk; and again I heard them weigh out peace and war, as\r\nthey weighed out the gold on the table. But I was not rich—not very rich.\r\nTherefore, when those that had power and knowledge and wealth talked\r\ntogether, I sat in the shadow. Why not?\r\n\r\n‘Yet all my wanderings had shown me one sure thing, which is, that a King\r\nwithout money is like a spear without a head. He cannot do much harm. I\r\nsaid, therefore, to Elias of Bury, a great one among our people: “Why do\r\nour people lend any more to the Kings that oppress us?” “Because,” said\r\nElias, “if we refuse they stir up their people against us, and the People\r\nare tenfold more cruel than Kings. If thou doubtest, come with me to Bury\r\nin England and live as I live.”\r\n\r\n‘I saw my mother’s face across the candle-flame, and I said, “I will come\r\nwith thee to Bury. Maybe my Kingdom shall be there.”\r\n\r\n‘So I sailed with Elias to the darkness and the cruelty of Bury in\r\nEngland, where there are no learned men. How can a man be wise if he hate?\r\nAt Bury I kept his accounts for Elias, and I saw men kill Jews there by\r\nthe tower. No—none laid hands on Elias. He lent money to the King, and the\r\nKing’s favour was about him. A King will not take the life so long as\r\nthere is any gold. This King—yes, John—oppressed his people bitterly\r\nbecause they would not give him money. Yet his land was a good land. If he\r\nhad only given it rest he might have cropped it as a Christian crops his\r\nbeard. But even _that_ little he did not know; for God had deprived him of\r\nall understanding, and had multiplied pestilence, and famine, and despair\r\nupon the people. Therefore his people turned against us Jews, who are all\r\npeople’s dogs. Why not? Lastly the Barons and the people rose together\r\nagainst the King because of his cruelties. Nay—nay—the Barons did not love\r\nthe people, but they saw that if the King eat up and destroyed the common\r\npeople, he would presently destroy the Barons. They joined then, as cats\r\nand pigs will join to slay a snake. I kept the accounts, and I watched all\r\nthese things, for I remembered the Prophecy.\r\n\r\n‘A great gathering of Barons (to most of whom we had lent money) came to\r\nBury, and there, after much talk and a thousand runnings-about, they made\r\na roll of the New Laws that they would force on the King. If he swore to\r\nkeep those Laws, they would allow him a little money. That was the King’s\r\nGod—Money—to waste. They showed us the roll of the New Laws. Why not? We\r\nhad lent them money. We knew all their counsels—we Jews shivering behind\r\nour doors in Bury.’ He threw out his hands suddenly. ‘We did not seek to\r\nbe paid _all_ in money. We sought Power—Power—Power! That is _our_ God in\r\nour captivity. Power to use!\r\n\r\n‘I said to Elias: “These New Laws are good. Lend no more money to the\r\nKing: so long as he has money he will lie and slay the people.”\r\n\r\n‘“Nay,” said Elias. “I know this people. They are madly cruel. Better one\r\nKing than a thousand butchers. I have lent a little money to the Barons,\r\nor they would torture us, but my most I will lend to the King. He hath\r\npromised me a place near him at Court, where my wife and I shall be safe.”\r\n\r\n‘“But if the King be made to keep these New Laws,” I said, “the land will\r\nhave peace, and our trade will grow. If we lend he will fight again.”\r\n\r\n‘“Who made thee a Lawgiver in England?” said Elias. “I know this people.\r\nLet the dogs tear one another! I will lend the King ten thousand pieces of\r\ngold, and he can fight the Barons at his pleasure.”\r\n\r\n‘“There are not two thousand pieces of gold in all England this summer,” I\r\nsaid, for I kept the accounts, and I knew how the earth’s gold moved—that\r\nwonderful underground river! Elias barred home the windows, and, his hands\r\nabout his mouth, he told me how, when he was trading with small wares in a\r\nFrench ship, he had come to the Castle of Pevensey.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh!’ said Dan. ‘Pevensey again!’ and looked at Una, who nodded and\r\nskipped.\r\n\r\n‘There, after they had scattered his pack up and down the Great Hall, some\r\nyoung knights carried him to an upper room, and dropped him into a well in\r\na wall, that rose and fell with the tide. They called him Joseph, and\r\nthrew torches at his wet head. Why not?’\r\n\r\n‘Why, of course,’ cried Dan. ‘Didn’t you know it was——’ Puck held up his\r\nhand to stop him, and Kadmiel, who never noticed, went on.\r\n\r\n‘When the tide dropped he thought he stood on old armour, but feeling with\r\nhis toes, he raked up bar on bar of soft gold. Some wicked treasure of the\r\nold days put away, and the secret cut off by the sword. I have heard the\r\nlike before.’\r\n\r\n‘So have we,’ Una whispered. ‘But it wasn’t wicked a bit.’\r\n\r\n‘Elias took a morsel of the stuff with him, and thrice yearly he would\r\nreturn to Pevensey as a chapman, selling at no price or profit, till they\r\nsuffered him to sleep in the empty room, where he would plumb and grope,\r\nand steal away a few bars. The great store of it still remained, and by\r\nlong brooding he had come to look on it as his own. Yet when we thought\r\nhow we should lift and convey it, we saw no way. This was before the Word\r\nof the Lord had come to me. A walled fortress possessed by Normans; in the\r\nmidst a forty-foot tide-well out of which to remove secretly many\r\nhorse-loads of gold! Hopeless! So Elias wept. Adah, his wife, wept too.\r\nShe had hoped to stand beside the Queen’s Christian tiring-maids at Court,\r\nwhen the King should give them that place at Court which he had promised.\r\nWhy not? She was born in England—an odious woman.\r\n\r\n‘The present evil to us was that Elias, out of his strong folly, had, as\r\nit were, promised the King that he would arm him with more gold. Wherefore\r\nthe King in his camp stopped his ears against the Barons and the people.\r\nWherefore men died daily. Adah so desired her place at Court, she besought\r\nElias to tell the King where the treasure lay, that the King might take it\r\nby force, and—they would trust in his gratitude. Why not? This Elias\r\nrefused to do, for he looked on the gold as his own. They quarrelled, and\r\nthey wept at the evening meal, and late in the night came one Langton—a\r\npriest, almost learned—to borrow more money for the Barons. Elias and Adah\r\nwent to their chamber.’\r\n\r\nKadmiel laughed scornfully in his beard. The shots across the valley\r\nstopped as the shooting-party changed their ground for the last beat.\r\n\r\n‘So it was I, not Elias,’ he went on, quietly, ‘that made terms with\r\nLangton touching the fortieth of the New Laws.’\r\n\r\n‘What terms?’ said Puck, quickly. ‘The Fortieth of the Great Charter say:\r\n“To none will we sell, refuse, or deny right or justice.”’\r\n\r\n‘True, but the Barons had written first: _To no free man._ It cost me two\r\nhundred broad pieces of gold to change those narrow words. Langton, the\r\npriest, understood. “Jew though thou art,” said he, “the change is just,\r\nand if ever Christian and Jew come to be equal in England thy people may\r\nthank thee.” Then he went out stealthily, as men do who deal with Israel\r\nby night. I think he spent my gift upon his altar. Why not? I have spoken\r\nwith Langton. He was such a man as I might have been if—if we Jews had\r\nbeen a people. But yet, in many things, a child.\r\n\r\n‘I heard Elias and Adah abovestairs quarrel, and, knowing the woman was\r\nthe stronger, I saw that Elias would tell the King of the gold and that\r\nthe King would continue in his stubbornness. Therefore I saw that the gold\r\nmust be put away from the reach of any man. Of a sudden, the Word of the\r\nLord came to me saying, “The Morning is come, O thou that dwellest in the\r\nland.”’\r\n\r\nKadmiel halted, all black against the pale green sky beyond the wood—a\r\nhuge robed figure, like the Moses in the picture-Bible.\r\n\r\n‘I rose. I went out, and as I shut the door on that House of Foolishness,\r\nthe woman looked from the window and whispered, “I have prevailed on my\r\nhusband to tell the King!” I answered, “There is no need. The Lord is with\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n‘In that hour the Lord gave me full understanding of all that I must do;\r\nand His Hand covered me in my ways. First I went to London, to a physician\r\nof our people, who sold me certain drugs that I needed. You shall see why.\r\nThence I went swiftly to Pevensey. Men fought all around me, for there\r\nwere neither rulers nor judges in the abominable land. Yet when I walked\r\nby them they cried out that I was one Ahasuerus, a Jew, condemned, as they\r\nbelieve, to live for ever, and they fled from me everyways. Thus the Lord\r\nsaved me for my work, and at Pevensey I bought me a little boat and moored\r\nit on the mud beneath the Marsh-gate of the Castle. That also God showed\r\nme.’\r\n\r\nHe was as calm as though he were speaking of some stranger, and his voice\r\nfilled the little bare wood with rolling music.\r\n\r\n‘I cast’—his hand went to his breast, and again the strange jewel\r\ngleamed—‘I cast the drugs which I had prepared into the common well of the\r\nCastle. Nay, I did no harm. The more we physicians know, the less do we\r\ndo. Only the fool says: “I dare.” I caused a blotched and itching rash to\r\nbreak out upon their skins, but I knew it would fade in fifteen days. I\r\ndid not stretch out my hand against their life. They in the Castle thought\r\nit was the Plague, and they ran forth, taking with them their very dogs.\r\n\r\n‘A Christian physician, seeing that I was a Jew and a stranger, vowed that\r\nI had brought the sickness from London. This is the one time I have ever\r\nheard a Christian leech speak truth of any disease. Thereupon the people\r\nbeat me, but a merciful woman said: “Do not kill him now. Push him into\r\nour Castle with his plague, and if, as he says, it will abate on the\r\nfifteenth day, we can kill him then.” Why not? They drove me across the\r\ndrawbridge of the Castle, and fled back to their booths. Thus I came to be\r\nalone with the treasure.’\r\n\r\n‘But did you know this was all going to happen just right?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘My Prophecy was that I should be a Lawgiver to a People of a strange land\r\nand a hard speech. I knew I should not die. I washed my cuts. I found the\r\ntide-well in the wall, and from Sabbath to Sabbath I dove and dug there in\r\nthat empty, Christian-smelling fortress. Hé! I spoiled the Egyptians! Hé!\r\nIf they had only known! I drew up many good loads of gold, which I loaded\r\nby night into my boat. There had been gold-dust too, but that had been\r\nwashed away by the tides.’\r\n\r\n‘Didn’t you ever wonder who had put it there?’ said Dan, stealing a glance\r\nat Puck’s calm, dark face under the hood of his gown. Puck shook his head\r\nand pursed his lips.\r\n\r\n‘Often; for the gold was new to me,’ Kadmiel replied. ‘I know the Golds. I\r\ncan judge them in the dark; but this was heavier and redder than any we\r\ndeal in. Perhaps it was the very gold of Parvaim. Eh, why not? It went to\r\nmy heart to heave it on to the mud, but I saw well that if the evil thing\r\nremained, or if even the hope of finding it remained, the King would not\r\nsign the New Laws, and the land would perish.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, Marvel!’ said Puck, beneath his breath, rustling in the dead leaves.\r\n\r\n‘When the boat was loaded I washed my hands seven times, and pared beneath\r\nmy nails, for I would not keep one grain. I went out by the little gate\r\nwhere the Castle’s refuse is thrown. I dared not hoist sail lest men\r\nshould see me; but the Lord commanded the tide to bear me carefully, and I\r\nwas far from land before the morning.’\r\n\r\n‘Weren’t you afraid?’ said Una.\r\n\r\n‘Why? There were no Christians in the boat. At sunrise I made my prayer,\r\nand cast the gold—all—all that gold into the deep sea! A King’s ransom—no,\r\nthe ransom of a People! When I had loosed hold of the last bars, the Lord\r\ncommanded the tide to return me to a haven at the mouth of a river, and\r\nthence I walked across a wilderness to Lewes, where I have brethren. They\r\nopened the door to me, and they say—I had not eaten for two days—they say\r\nthat I fell across the threshold, crying, “I have sunk an army with\r\nhorsemen in the sea!”’\r\n\r\n‘But you hadn’t,’ said Una. ‘Oh, yes! I see! You meant that King John\r\nmight have spent it on that?’\r\n\r\n‘Even so,’ said Kadmiel.\r\n\r\nThe firing broke out again close behind them. The pheasants poured over\r\nthe top of a belt of tall firs. They could see young Mr. Meyer, in his new\r\nyellow gaiters, very busy and excited at the end of the line, and they\r\ncould hear the thud of the falling birds.\r\n\r\n‘But what did Elias of Bury do?’ Puck demanded. ‘He had promised money to\r\nthe King.’\r\n\r\nKadmiel smiled grimly. ‘I sent him word from London that the Lord was on\r\nmy side. When he heard that the Plague had broken out in Pevensey, and\r\nthat a Jew had been thrust into the Castle to cure it, he understood my\r\nword was true. He and Adah hurried to Lewes and asked me for an\r\naccounting. He still looked on the gold as his own. I told them where I\r\nhad laid it, and I gave them full leave to pick it up.... Eh, well! The\r\ncurses of a fool and the dust of a journey are two things no wise man can\r\nescape.... But I pitied Elias! The King was wroth at him because he could\r\nnot lend; the Barons were wroth at him because they heard that he would\r\nhave lent to the King; and Adah was wroth at him because she was an odious\r\nwoman. They took ship from Lewes to Spain. That was wise!’\r\n\r\n‘And you? Did you see the signing of the Law at Runnymede?’ said Puck, as\r\nKadmiel laughed noiselessly.\r\n\r\n‘Nay. Who am I to meddle with things too high for me? I returned to Bury,\r\nand lent money on the autumn crops. Why not?’\r\n\r\nThere was a crackle overhead. A cock-pheasant that had sheered aside after\r\nbeing hit spattered down almost on top of them, driving up the dry leaves\r\nlike a shell. _Flora_ and _Folly_ threw themselves at it; the children\r\nrushed forward, and when they had beaten them off and smoothed down the\r\nplumage Kadmiel had disappeared.\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ said Puck, calmly, ‘what did you think of it? Weland gave the\r\nSword. The Sword gave the Treasure, and the Treasure gave the Law. It’s as\r\nnatural as an oak growing.’\r\n\r\n‘I don’t understand. Didn’t he know it was Sir Richard’s old treasure?’\r\nsaid Dan. ‘And why did Sir Richard and Brother Hugh leave it lying about?\r\nAnd—and——’\r\n\r\n‘Never mind,’ said Una, politely. ‘He’ll let us come and go, and look, and\r\nknow another time. Won’t you, Puck?’\r\n\r\n‘Another time maybe,’ Puck answered. ‘Brr! It’s cold—and late. I’ll race\r\nyou towards home!’\r\n\r\nThey hurried down into the sheltered valley. The sun had almost sunk\r\nbehind Cherry Clack, the trodden ground by the cattle-gates was freezing\r\nat the edges, and the new-waked north wind blew the night on them from\r\nover the hills. They picked up their feet and flew across the browned\r\npastures, and when they halted, panting in the steam of their own breath,\r\nthe dead leaves whirled up behind them. There was Oak and Ash and Thorn\r\nenough in that year-end shower to magic away a thousand memories.\r\n\r\nSo they trotted to the brook at the bottom of the lawn, wondering why\r\n_Flora_ and _Folly_ had missed the quarry-hole fox.\r\n\r\nOld Hobden was just finishing some hedge-work. They saw his white smock\r\nglimmer in the twilight where he faggoted the rubbish.\r\n\r\n‘Winter, he’s come, I rackon, Mus’ Dan,’ he called. ‘Hard times now till\r\nHeffle Cuckoo Fair. Yes, we’ll all be glad to see the Old Woman let the\r\nCuckoo out o’ the basket for to start lawful Spring in England.’ They\r\nheard a crash, and a stamp and a splash of water as though a heavy old cow\r\nwere crossing almost under their noses.\r\n\r\nHobden ran forward angrily to the ford.\r\n\r\n‘Gleason’s bull again, playin’ Robin all over the Farm! Oh, look, Mus’\r\nDan—his great footmark as big as a trencher. No bounds to his impidence!\r\nHe might count himself to be a man—or Somebody.’\r\n\r\nA voice the other side of the brook boomed:\r\n\r\n  ‘I marvel who his cloak would turn\r\n  When Puck had led him round\r\n  Or where those walking fires would burn——’\r\n\r\nThen the children went in singing “Farewell Rewards and Fairies” at the\r\ntops of their voices. They had forgotten that they had not even said\r\ngood-night to Puck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDREN’S SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Land of our Birth, we pledge to thee_\r\n  _Our love and toil in the years to be,_\r\n  _When we are grown and take our place,_\r\n  _As men and women with our race._\r\n\r\n  Father in Heaven who lovest all,\r\n  Oh help Thy children when they call;\r\n  That they may build from age to age,\r\n  An undefiled heritage!\r\n\r\n  Teach us to bear the yoke in youth,\r\n  With steadfastness and careful truth;\r\n  That, in our time, Thy Grace may give\r\n  The Truth whereby the Nations live.\r\n\r\n  Teach us to rule ourselves alway,\r\n  Controlled and cleanly night and day;\r\n  That we may bring, if need arise,\r\n  No maimed or worthless sacrifice.\r\n\r\n  Teach us to look in all our ends,\r\n  On Thee for judge, and not our friends;\r\n  That we, with Thee, may walk uncowed\r\n  By fear or favour of the crowd.\r\n\r\n  Teach us the Strength that cannot seek,\r\n  By deed or thought, to hurt the weak;\r\n  That, under Thee, we may possess\r\n  Man’s strength to comfort man’s distress.\r\n\r\n  Teach us Delight in simple things,\r\n  And Mirth that has no bitter springs;\r\n  Forgiveness free of evil done,\r\n  And Love to all men ’neath the sun!\r\n\r\n  _Land of our Birth, our Faith our Pride,_\r\n  _For whose dear sake our fathers died;_\r\n  _O Motherland, we pledge to thee,_\r\n  _Head, heart, and hand through the years to be!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 Copyright, 1905, by Rudyard Kipling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following typographical errors were corrected:\r\n\r\n      page 7, “Pyramis” changed to “Pyramus”\r\n      page 9, quotes added before “couldn’t” and “I”\r\n      page 13, “draggons” changed to “dragons”\r\n      page 27, quote added before “Late”\r\n      page 43, “summons” changed to “summon”\r\n      page 51, “we” added before “do”\r\n      page 62, double quote changed to single quote after “pirate-folk?”\r\n      page 64, semicolon added after “Yes”\r\n      page 68, double “said” removed, single quote changed to double quote\r\n      after “kill!”\r\n      page 69, comma added after “Kitai”\r\n      page 76, double “where” removed\r\n      page 85, quote added after “gold!”\r\n      page 97, quote removed after “Aquila.”\r\n      page 99, “shouder” changed to “shoulder”, single quote changed to\r\n      double quote after “Look!”\r\n      page 102, “learned” changed to “leaned”\r\n      page 103, “a” added between “is” and “good”\r\n      page 108, quote removed before “At”\r\n      page 110, single quote changed to double quote before “But”\r\n      page 127, quote added after “catapult,”, quote removed after “Una.”,\r\n      “quicky” changed to “quickly”\r\n      page 128, comma removed after “bigger”\r\n      page 135, “hmself” changed to “himself”\r\n      page 137, “did’nt” changed to “didn’t”\r\n      page 141, quote added before “But”\r\n      page 142, single quote changed to double quote after “reason,”\r\n      page 143, “Cylops” changed to “Cyclops”\r\n      page 152, “Caesar” changed to “Cæsar”\r\n      page 153, comma added after “children,”\r\n      page 156, quote added after “make.”\r\n      page 160, comma added after “No”, period added after “up”\r\n      page 166, quote added after “thoughts.”\r\n      page 170, double quote changed to single quote before “Sorry”\r\n      page 184, single quote changed to double quote after “Man.”\r\n      page 188, single quote changed to double quote after “him,”,\r\n      “to-day?” and “finished!”\r\n      page 193, quote added after “letter.”\r\n      page 205, parenthesis added after “complain”\r\n      page 214, period added after “lime.”\r\n      page 218, “sepentines” changed to “serpentines”\r\n      page 224, quote added after “voice.”\r\n      page 235, apostroph moved after “conjurin’.”\r\n      page 237, quote added before “Dymchurch”\r\n      page 239, apostroph and comma changed after “nothin’,“\r\n      page 240, “shouder” changed to “shoulder”\r\n      page 241, apostroph and periodchanged after “bein’.”\r\n      page 244, apostroph added after “an”\r\n      page 248, comma removed after “Robin”\r\n      page 260, “asid” changed to “said”\r\n      page 269, “stubborness” changed to “stubbornness”\r\n      page 275, quote added before “I”, “burne” changed to “burn”",
