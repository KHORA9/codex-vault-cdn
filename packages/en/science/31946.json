B.\r\nLIPPINCOTT & CO., in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG THE KABYLES.\r\n\r\nTWO PAPERS.--I.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOSQUE AND DWELLING OF MARABOUTS, KOUKOU.]\r\n\r\nRemains of old nationalities are scattered in odd corners all over the\r\nearth. Every land, almost, possesses a relic of the kind markedly\r\ndifferent from the specimens preserved elsewhere, and peculiar enough to\r\ngive color to the old theory of its having sprung from the soil. These\r\ntorn and battered shreds of humanity are usually found lodged among the\r\nrocks, the blast of foreign invasion having driven them thither from the\r\nplains. The mountains not only give them shelter, but seem to reinfuse\r\nnew vigor, and thus in many cases enable them to exert more or less of a\r\nreflex influence on their conquerors. This influence varies with the\r\ncharacter of the country and of the respective races. The invaders, if\r\nactuated by civilizing impulses and not mere military ambition, will\r\nmake themselves useful and necessary to the natives, develop what\r\ncapacity they have, and absorb them politically. In the opposite case\r\nfusion is not effected, and a degree of antagonism is maintained which\r\nbreaks out on occasion into actual hostilities. Between these two\r\nextreme cases we may trace an infinity of examples, modified by endless\r\ncombinations of circumstances and conditions.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain we see the Gael whirled up by successive gusts from\r\nItaly, the Elbe and Normandy into the clefts of the Welsh and Scottish\r\nmountains. France has driven her aborigines into the peninsula of\r\nBrittany and the gorges of the Eastern Pyrenees. The Finns find refuge\r\namong the frozen swamps north-east of St. Petersburg. The ethnic museum\r\nof mountainous Spain is more rich and varied than that of her Northern\r\nneighbors, and Italy has remnants dating back into the night of historic\r\ntime in Sardinia and the Abruzzi. Japan, ancient as she is, has her\r\nAinos of unrecorded antiquity, and the ranges of Central India are\r\nhaunted by races still more primitive and unprepossessing in manners and\r\nphysiognomy. Over the plains of both continents so many successive waves\r\nof population have swept that no race can claim more than a comparative\r\nantiquity. The traceable pedigree of any given community becomes very\r\nshort indeed, and the inquirer contents himself with conceding that the\r\nThibetan sept which arrogates descent from Alexander's Greeks may do so\r\nwith truth--say as much truth as there was in the descent of certain\r\nstraw-colored Creeks and Choctaws from the followers of De Soto.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Thibetans, the Kabyles repudiate classic origin. They are the\r\nonly people who have made \"barbarian\" a title of honor, and call\r\nthemselves Berbers, the modern name having been given them by the\r\nArabs. The dwellers on the Danube, the Seine and the Thames, who once\r\nshared with them the designation of \"barbarian,\" were quick to shake it\r\noff. European Barbary exists no longer. Its modern inhabitants amuse\r\nthemselves with exploring the southern shore of the Mediterranean, and\r\nin ascertaining whether their whilom fellow-provincials of that coast\r\nare still determined to be barbarous in fact as in name. The Germans\r\ntook their turn at an attempt of this character in the days of Genseric,\r\nthe Vandal name and nation having wound up its career in Africa, sinking\r\ninto the sands of that inhospitable continent irrecoverably, unless we\r\naccept the Kabyles as the representatives of their blood. Forty years\r\nago another Northern race entered upon the task, the misrule of the Arab\r\nand the Turk having apparently prepared the way for a new invasion. The\r\nFrench pined for an opportunity of testing once more their genius for\r\ncolonization, and they selected this time, in place of a wild tract in\r\nAmerica or Oceanica, a region opposite their own shores cultivated and\r\ndensely peopled when Gaul was savage, and still occupied by inhabitants\r\nas proud and turbulent as those who proposed to reclaim and reconstruct\r\nthem. Kabylia proper is a part of the Algerine territory but a few hours\r\ndistant from the walls of Algiers, of the size of an average French\r\ndepartment, and having a population of one hundred and seventy-five to\r\nthe square mile--a ratio identical with that of France. But the new\r\nprovince, like its new mother--or step-mother--country, had also its\r\noutliers of territory and people. The Kabyles overflow east, west and\r\nsouth. They nearly equal the Arabs of Algeria in numbers, the Mountain\r\nKabyles being estimated at five hundred and eighty thousand, and those\r\nof the plain at three hundred and seventy-nine thousand, while the Arabs\r\ncount in all one million three hundred and eighty-five thousand. These\r\nfigures measure the extent to which the Oriental immigration has\r\nsupplanted the natives of Romano-Gothic Numidian origin. Its effect in\r\nother respects has hardly been in a like proportion. It has imposed the\r\nMohammedan religion in a modified form, strangely mixed with relics of\r\nolder superstitions. In language it has wrought much less of a change,\r\nthough more than can be traced to either the Vandals or the Romans. In\r\nphysique and manners the difference between Arab and Kabyle remains\r\nsharply drawn. The Arabs are gaunt and indolent dwellers in tents, as\r\nthey were in the days of Job, the spear their only implement; while the\r\nKabyles herd in towns, weave, forge and plough. Red beards, light eyes,\r\nbroad and round skulls and massive features are not unfrequent among the\r\nKabyle men, and in many of the villages the children are all blondes, as\r\nare to a less degree the women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL-WORKS.]\r\n\r\nIn nothing, perhaps, is the line more strongly drawn between the two\r\nraces than in the treatment of their females. The Asiatic seclusion of\r\nwomen is unknown among the Kabyles. There are no harems and no veils.\r\nIf, in return, the Kabyle women are subjected to more of such unfeminine\r\nemployments as harvesting and turning the wheels of olive-mills, that\r\ndoes not lessen the assimilation to Western usage, but rather increases\r\nthe resemblance between the life of the fair Africans and that of their\r\nsisters among the peasantry of Europe. Carrying water, so characteristic\r\na female office in the East, as the artists are constantly reminding us,\r\nis none the less so among the Kabyles. But it becomes a more serious\r\nmatter when the wells or streams are three or four hundred feet lower\r\nthan the site of the dwelling to be supplied. In such cases donkeys come\r\nto the aid of their mistresses, at some sacrifice of the picturesque,\r\nbut with great advantage to comfort.\r\n\r\nA water-supply thus obtained must be, it is obvious, inadequate to the\r\ndemands of scrupulous cleanliness. Accordingly, the desert wanderer has\r\nthe advantage in this respect of the Kabyles, crowded into a village\r\nperched on the summit of a rock and traversed only by pathways cut, as\r\nit were, through solid blocks of houses. These abodes are of but one\r\nstory, and generally of one room. Bipeds and quadrupeds live together,\r\neating and sleeping on the same earthen floor. There are no chimneys and\r\nno windows. Cutaneous and ophthalmic affections are of course common,\r\nand typhus fever now and then redresses the balance in Malthusian\r\nfashion by reducing the crowd. Death is the great sanitary regulator or\r\nsuperintendent of hygiene. His functions in this regard are but\r\nslightly, if at all, interfered with by the authorities of the village.\r\n\r\nThe head of the municipality is an officer called an _amin_: we might\r\nstyle him the mayor. He is chosen by popular suffrage from each of the\r\nfamily or patriarchal groups or clans composing the community in turn.\r\nHe is guided in his administration by a code of written laws bearing the\r\nname of _khanoun_ or canon, established from time immemorial. He is\r\nchecked also by a city council chosen from among the notables, and is\r\nrequired to consult it before taking any executive or judicial step. The\r\nsecretary of the council, elected by it, bears the title of _chodja_. He\r\nis generally an old codger, for the double reason that clerks usually do\r\ngrow old in harness, and that writing is not a universal accomplishment\r\namong the Kabyles and competition for the office is not great. He keeps\r\nthe journal of the municipality, and conducts all its correspondence\r\nwith other towns and with the French authorities. He enjoys a salary,\r\npaid in kind with figs, olives, etc. In this pleasant feature of his\r\npost he seems to be distinguished from his associate functionaries. We\r\ndo not find that they receive any pay, unless in the indirect shape of\r\nbribes and perquisites--a mode of compensation as well understood in the\r\nEast as in the West.\r\n\r\nMoslem influence shows itself in the close association of Church and\r\nState. The mosque of each town has its treasury, fed by the fines\r\nimposed on transgressors by the municipal council and by dues from the\r\nregistration of marriages, births and deaths. The sacred building itself\r\nserves another purpose still more alien to its religious character. The\r\nhustings, even among this simple and primitive people, are not scenes of\r\nunbroken tranquillity. There are always two parties in the village, as\r\nwith us; but, as fortunately is not the in the United States, these\r\nparties have casehardened into hereditary factions, always ready to air\r\ntheir ancestral feuds at the polls. Bullets come to the aid of ballots.\r\nTo use the local expression, \"The speaking is done with powder.\" The\r\nrude fire-lock of the country, with its absurdly long barrel and\r\nwheel-lock, answers well enough at short range, and proves highly\r\ninfluential in bringing about a speedy decision without the assistance\r\nof returning boards and electoral commissions. The villages have rarely\r\nmore than two or three thousand souls, and cover but a few acres. The\r\ndispute cannot last long, and contested elections are soon settled. The\r\nmosque is one story higher than the other buildings, having a second\r\nfloor. It is also on more elevated ground. These attractions cause the\r\nsanctuary to fill up rapidly in time of trouble. The faithful who get\r\nfirst to church have a marked advantage over their fellow-parishioners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KABYLE WAKE.]\r\n\r\nThe administration of the tribe comes directly under French control. It\r\nis committed to a chief who is not allowed to interfere with the local\r\naffairs of the villages composing the tribe. But pressure in the\r\ndirection of centralization is gradually being employed by the French,\r\nin accordance with the political notions and genius of that nation. It\r\nneeds, however, to be used with extreme caution, as warning catastrophes\r\nstill occur to prove. The solemn engagement made when the Kabyles\r\ncapitulated in 1857, to rigidly respect their public customs and their\r\ncommunal elections, will enforce itself upon the more or less sincere\r\nattention of the invaders as long as they possess the country. The\r\nstormy clanhood that insists on the luxury of at least an annual fight\r\namong neighbors is often the last hold of national independence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POLLS: MODEL VOTERS.]\r\n\r\nFrance is not the first suzerain who has found it hard to rule, and\r\nindispensable to sedulously humor, these restless indigenes. They were\r\nquite as troublesome to the Turks. The dey of Algiers was but a nominal\r\nbranch of the home house at Constantinople. Thanks to his Kabyle\r\nconstituents, he did business pretty much on his own account and in his\r\nown way. Could the sultan have been held responsible for the piracies of\r\nhis nominal vassal, they would have been put an end to a century sooner.\r\nHe could not control the dey because the dey could not control the\r\nKabyles. At the village of Tiza-Terga is shown--or was a year or two\r\nago--a curious field-piece of hexagonal form abandoned by the Turks in\r\nthe seventeenth century after an unsuccessful attack on the Kabyle\r\nstronghold of Koukou. When the dey yielded to the French he conveyed\r\nwhat he was unable to deliver, and the conquest of the country has been\r\ngoing on ever since. This process of subjugation is anything but\r\nsteady. The years of tranquillity outnumber those of disturbance, and\r\nthat disproportion, already very great, may be said to be increasing. In\r\nthe long intervals of peace everything goes on smoothly. The natives\r\nbusy themselves in their fields and their simple workshops, content with\r\nthe occasional effervescence of a town-quarrel. The exports of the\r\nprovince mount up rapidly. France felicitates herself on the brilliant\r\nsuccess of her experiment, sends over small groups of immigrants and\r\noccupies herself with projects of vast prospective value. Paper railways\r\npermeate the gorges of the Djurjura Mountains, and paper canals lead the\r\nwaters of the Mediterranean into the desert basin beyond. She repairs\r\nsome of the Roman aqueducts, builds wooden bridges, keeps at bay the\r\npurely predatory tribes of the interior, and protects industry as\r\ncertainly it never was protected under the Turks. She manifests a\r\nsincere wish to make the tri-color a blessing to Africa, and with time\r\nand no disaster at home bids fair to succeed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KABYLE ARMORERS AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nWere she to be driven out to-day, the traces of her beneficent sway\r\nwould be more marked than those left by her predecessors, or by _their_\r\npredecessors the Vandals. They could not possibly be less so. The\r\nmission of both these was fruitful chiefly of disorder and devastation.\r\nCompared with them, the natives whom they ruled against incessant\r\nprotest were the representatives of civilization. The Arabs built a few\r\nforts on the beach to shelter piracy. What the Vandals left were burnt\r\nand overthrown walls, the memory of some religious riots, and a small\r\nlibrary of pious polemics. Between them, they held the country for\r\nfifteen centuries: the Romans had it for four. All the moles and\r\nartificial forts, numerous and often massive; all the aqueducts, some of\r\nthem spanning ravines three hundred feet deep, and others stretching for\r\nmany leagues; all the cities, tombs and temples, of which the remains\r\nare scattered from the sea to the peaks,--everything, in fact, which\r\nshows that this was once a domain of art and intellect and culture, is\r\nRoman. Roman sepulchres look down upon the central French cantonment;\r\nRoman coins and gems are thrown out by the zouave, who works with the\r\npick in one hand and the rifle in the other; and the squared stones and\r\nround columns of Roman temples are built into the huts of the people and\r\nthe forts of their present rulers.\r\n\r\nThis superiority of the ancient methods of colonization, as attested by\r\nresults, cannot be explained by any advantage in the arts of war\r\ncomparable to that now enjoyed by the invading nation. Gunpowder did not\r\nexist to cast the balance. The success attained must be ascribed to a\r\ndeeper knowledge of the arts of peace, and especially those of\r\ngovernment. Surely the nineteenth century ought to be able to discover\r\nthe secret.\r\n\r\nTheir suspicions once allayed, and apprehensions of purposes of mere\r\nmilitary encroachment and new oppression removed, the Kabyles are very\r\nready to forward the construction of works of public utility, and\r\nrespond with alacrity to calls for labor. The mountain-streams, nearly\r\ndry for great part of the year, are at times swelled by destructive\r\nfloods which carry down great boulders and trunks of trees. For want of\r\nbridges, access to the open-air markets which are held at places and\r\nperiods fixed by long usage is thus liable to be prevented.\r\n\r\nOne of the most largely attended of these markets is held on the right\r\nbank of the small river Djemaa at a point about midway between Fort\r\nNational on the north and the summit of the Djurjura on the south, three\r\nor four leagues from either. The crowd of buyers and sellers, most of\r\nthem belonging to both classes, reaches as many as four thousand. The\r\nfreshets of the Djemaa becoming yearly more of an impediment to travel,\r\nthe tribe of the Beni-Menguellet, upon whose territory the fair is held,\r\nbecame fearful of the loss of its commercial advantages, which were\r\nlargely dependent on the visits of the tribes on the left bank. They\r\nconsequently proposed the building of a bridge, and offered to furnish\r\nmen and materials to be used under French direction. A section of\r\nsappers commanded by a lieutenant soon finished the work with the aid\r\npromised. The Kabyles showed great skill in the handling of their rude\r\ntools. With their small axes they felled large trees so rapidly as to\r\nastonish the French. The felling, however, was a minor part of the task.\r\nThe heavy beams had to be carried from the bottom of the steep ravine up\r\ngoat-paths to the level of the bridge. This was done in the old\r\nEgyptian way, by sheer multiplication of hands, with no aid from the\r\nmechanical forces. A number of men took hold of each beam and of\r\nhand-spikes passed under it where the track was wide enough, and others\r\ndrew by ropes. The slow and solemn procession, enlivening its way with\r\nequally solemn chants in the deepest of gutturals, climbed the precipice\r\non the slow but sure principle. The bridge was a success, the threatened\r\ndiversion of trade escaped, and Beni-Menguellet stock stood at a higher\r\nquotation than ever. A squad of sappers, not a mouthful in a military\r\nsense for the hundreds of Kabyles they supervised, had done more to win\r\nthe loyalty of the natives than a brigade of _beaux sabreurs_ or\r\ncave-smokers could have accomplished. The hammer rather than the musket\r\nis the weapon of subjugation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORT NATIONAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN TOMB, NEAR FORT NATIONAL.]\r\n\r\nAt these markets Kabylia sits to the foreigner for her picture. How she\r\nlives, what she produces and what she wants is plainly and picturesquely\r\nstated. The inevitable Jew, in beard and gaberdine, brings from the city\r\nhis pack of trinkets and gay stuff, with bales of heavier tissues for\r\nthe excessively simple work-day robes of the Kabyle. The rich plain of\r\nOued Sahel sends its wheat and barley to exchange for the products of\r\nthe hill-loving olive-orchard and fig-plantation. The Beni-Janni, chiefs\r\nof the metal-workers, sit surrounded by enticing rows of swords,\r\ndaggers, guns, armlets, leglets, silver and copper-gilt head-dresses and\r\nbrooches. Vases in clay, ornamental and plain in every gradation, are\r\nthe specialty of the Beni-Aissi. The Beni-bou-Yousef are the weavers,\r\nfamous for many-colored haïks and burnouses, leaving to the Beni-Abbes a\r\nrepute for similar garments of a particular striped fabric. Horses of\r\nthe Barb type, small but elegant in figure, come from all quarters; but\r\nmules, which are offered in considerable number, are something of a\r\nmonopoly with the Beni-Ouassif, the Kentuckians of Kabylia. Women,\r\nindifferent as to tribe, and indifferent also, it is sad to state, in\r\nappearance, being mostly over age, spread stores of butter, honey, eggs,\r\nfruit, lean poultry and herbs. The young ladies, there as in other parts\r\nof the world, come not to sell, but to shop. Things of Paris are not\r\nwanting to encourage this propensity, which grows by what it feeds on,\r\nand promotes the civilization of the country by the creation of\r\nartificial wants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN IMPROVISED GOBLET.]\r\n\r\nBrushing through dewy thickets of lentisk and rose-bay, or drawn sharp\r\nagainst the vivid African sky on the summit of a bare spur, groups of\r\nmountaineers with their wares and their flocks wend their way at dawn to\r\nthe market. It has the air of a unanimous turn-out of the family, all\r\nwho can walk or be carried, with dogs, goats, sheep, asses and cattle,\r\nyielding to the common attraction. The Kabyles, unlike the Arabs, do not\r\nsmoke, making up for that privation by a much greater consumption of\r\nmeat. The marketers of the Beni-Menguellet will swallow for breakfast\r\nand dinner two score oxen and twice as many sheep and goats. The\r\nbutchering is done on the spot, or rather hard by, usually by negroes\r\nwho make it their profession, and journey from fair to fair with the\r\noutfit of knives and steel and a reed flute to beguile the way with\r\ngenuine African melodies. The Kabyles have no higher use for the negro,\r\nthe post of seraglio-guard assigned him among wealthier and more\r\northodox Moslems being a sinecure with them.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that these large commercial reunions are held as often\r\nas each week, we are prepared to recognize a degree of movement and\r\nenergy sufficient of itself to separate sharply the Kabyles from their\r\nAsiatic coreligionists. Repose is not their chief luxury. The charms of\r\n_kief_ are less irresistible than to the Arab or the Turk. The mere\r\nlabor, indeed, of reaching their rock-built homes exacts considerable\r\nbodily exertion. Compared with a daily climb of some hundreds of feet\r\nwhen the ploughman homeward takes his weary way, the toil of the\r\nharvest-field below looks like recreation. A life which keeps the blood\r\ncirculating so rapidly cannot fail to develop a hardy race full of the\r\npride born of conscious strength, and not disposed to yield readily to\r\nlords who exhaust their physical powers in scaling their eyries. Long\r\ntraining has given the natives something of the agility of the monkeys\r\nwith which they share the crags. Kabyle sharpshooters obstructed the\r\ncompletion of French hill-forts by ascending the parapet at night and\r\nwaking the garrison and the workmen with a storm of balls. The pursuit\r\nof them, when driven back, was unavailing. The soldiers, encumbered with\r\nclothing and accoutrements and shod with stiff leather, could hold no\r\nheadway with the Kabyle clad only in a tunic and grasping the cliffs\r\nwith four hands like the monkeys. Finally, dogs were imported, regularly\r\nbrigaded and regularly credited at the commissariat. Dogs are keen\r\ndistinguishers of persons and acute ethnologists. These traits, however,\r\nwere possessed alike by the African curs, which outnumbered the\r\nquadruped Gauls and fully sympathized with the prejudices of their dusky\r\nproprietors. This difficulty was fatal to the canine crusade. The\r\ninfidel dogs were too many for the Christians, and were soon able to\r\nredevote themselves to older enemies, the jackals and hyænas.\r\n\r\nA preference for peaceful industry may be said to have always prevailed\r\namong the Kabyles when left to themselves. The chronic passion for\r\nfighting was rather localized: particular villages were affected by it.\r\nThat of Taka, for instance, commandingly posted on a height thirty-five\r\nhundred feet above the level of the sea, has always been the terror of\r\nits neighbors. Whatever the flag or faith nominally in the ascendant,\r\nTaka took her place in the opposition and invited all Adullamites to\r\nmake their home within her gates. Misdirected energy like this will,\r\nunder a strong, patient and progressive government, be directed into\r\nmore useful channels. The most turbulent will become sensible of the\r\nnecessity of eating. The larder of crags and caves is necessarily meagre\r\nand precarious. The braves must go to market. For success at that place\r\nof popular resort they must carry something to sell in order to be able\r\nto buy, and they must behave themselves in 'change hours. On the latter\r\npoint the French and the peaceably disposed natives insist with\r\nincreasing unanimity. They will have to take a lesson from the vultures\r\nwhich stoop with them from the hills. These know market-day as well as\r\nthe almanac or the negro butcher. Punctual to a minute, they perch at a\r\nrespectful distance from the centre of traffic, frame the dusky crowd\r\nwith a circle of feathered sentinels in uniform of light gray, and\r\ncalmly await the distribution of such shreds of eatables as even the\r\nKabyle cannot use. It is impossible to fancy a gentleman who restricts\r\nhimself to the occupation of fighting, buying from those at whose\r\nexpense he pursues it his weekly supply of provisions, and marching home\r\nwith his _diss_, or strings of chops and cutlets, festooned from his\r\nspear or garlanded around his gallant brow.\r\n\r\nSuch is the drift of the times. Mankind is banded against brigandage.\r\nNever was an ancient and honorable profession so sadly under the weather\r\neverywhere. When it flares up into momentary life in Sicily or Attica\r\nthe newspapers seize hold of the event, a reporter is promptly on the\r\nspot, and the bandit-chief is interviewed as coolly as though he had\r\nmerely shot his wife, bought a legislature or effected a triumphant\r\ncorner in mess pork. Such depressing influences cannot but wear down the\r\nnoblest calling. Sicily is tamed, and Circassia, the Asiatic Kabylia,\r\nnearly so. A recent French tourist in Algeria was much struck with\r\ncertain resemblances between the two mountain-races separated by the\r\nlength of the Mediterranean and the Euxine. At the Kabyle rock-village\r\nof Tighil-boukbair the town band turned out to receive him. It consisted\r\nof a flute and two tambourines. Both the instruments and the airs\r\nappeared to him identical with those to which he had listened in the\r\ngorges of frosty Caucasus. At Tiflis he had \"assisted\" at a concert\r\nalmost the duplicate of the African entertainment. To make the\r\nresemblance perfect, it would have sufficed, he says, to strip the\r\nCaucasians to a single undergarment.\r\n\r\nThe same seeker of the picturesque describes a wayside scene\r\ncharacteristic alike of landscape, dress and manners. What can be more\r\nsensational than a draught of spring-water, under the shadow of a great\r\nrock in a weary land, from the hollowed palm of a Kabyle girl surrounded\r\nby her juniors arrayed in a costume that can neither be described nor\r\nexpressed, for the simple reason that it does not exist? A group like\r\nthis carries us back to within easy hail of the primal simplicity of\r\nEden. And a period little later than that of Adam and Eve is suggested\r\nby the experience of the same traveller at his halt a few hours later.\r\nAs Abraham, according to the custom of his day, was ready for the three\r\nangels with a substantial lunch, so the official Frenchman is the\r\nbeneficiary of a regulation which entitles him to an abundant _diffa_,\r\nor provender for man, horse and attendants, supplied by the nearest\r\nvillage. The Gaul is not always an angel, but his appetite is none the\r\nworse for that. Butter does not usually appear in the bill of fare, but\r\nits absence is amply atoned for by couscoussou, or African vermicelli,\r\nmutton, boiled fowls, honey and sour milk. This repast is served upon\r\nflat shallow dishes of wood or earthenware a foot and a half in\r\ndiameter, the universal platter of Kabylia, and must be a highly\r\nacceptable surprise in the desert. Wine is not a part of the required\r\nration, the native grapes, though delicious when eaten, not performing\r\nwell in the press and vat. Efforts are in progress to remedy this defect\r\nand make Algeria a wine-exporting country, but the summer heat is\r\nprobably too great, and the northern edge of the vine-zone will\r\ndoubtless maintain its supremacy over the southern, and make the Loire,\r\nthe Rhine and the Middle Danube lords of the vintage for all time. Yet\r\nthere is no more pacifying industry than wine-making, whatever may be\r\nsaid of wine-drinking; and the French anxiety to turn the Kabylian caves\r\ninto wine-vaults is sensible and laudable.\r\n\r\n                                                EDWARD C. BRUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PADUAN HOLIDAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Sant' Antonio's Day we strolled through the streets of\r\nPadua, side by side with the country-folk who had come from miles around\r\nto offer up their prayers at the shrine of the saint. Some rode jaded\r\nmules or were packed close in great market-wagons. Others trudged on\r\nfoot, with their dinners tied up in blue cotton handkerchiefs. There\r\nwere bronzed men in homespun, who pushed steadily on, aiding themselves\r\nwith mighty umbrellas; dark-eyed girls, with bright kerchiefs knotted\r\nabout their heads or carnations in their glossy braids; smart young\r\n_contadini_, with their hats tied afresh with ribbons and their long\r\nblue hose darned anew. The murmurs of the crowd, loud and merry and full\r\nof bursts of laughter, softened into a solemn whisper as the multitude\r\npressed onward to the broad piazza where the sanctuary of Sant' Antonio\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nOne by one the people lifted the leathern curtain of the church-door.\r\nThe men doffed their hats, the women told their beads. An awed hush fell\r\nupon those simple peasants as they gazed up at the vastness of the\r\narches. The world of the winepress and the silk-weaving and the soup-pot\r\nvanished from their hearts, and in its place came the illimitable calm\r\nwhich holds them bowed for hours against the altar-steps. But now they\r\npress on toward the shrine of the saint. The choir bursts into a\r\ntriumphant shout that seems to come from the throats of the bronze\r\nangels about the altar. The chancel is a blaze of light, against which\r\nstand two great dark bronze candelabra like sentinels of the tabernacle.\r\nThe steps before Sant' Antonio's shrine are half buried under the great\r\nwhite lilies that bear his name, and the tall dark angels that keep\r\nguard about his tomb bear sceptres of fresh lilies. There is no need of\r\nthe swinging silver censers. Myrrh and frankincense rise, sweet and\r\nstrong, from the depths of the snowy chalices. The children kneeling\r\nabout the altar bear stalks of the lilies like tall waxen tapers, that\r\nwave to and fro over the surging heads of the multitude. There are\r\ncarved pillars around the shrine brought from Byzantium, and great white\r\nmarble heads of saints and holy men stand out in relief from the walls.\r\nSilver lamps, beautiful with shining chains and the winged heads of\r\ncherubim, hang from the low vault, warming all the pale figures into\r\nlife with the crimson glow of the flame within.\r\n\r\nA little bell tinkles. There is a murmur of voices and a rustle of\r\ngarments throughout the church. The golden lights of the altar die away,\r\none by one. The people rise from their prayers with the wide-eyed,\r\nunseeing gaze of those who have been wandering in a far land. They have\r\ncrossed the sea with the blessed Antonio; they have followed him into\r\nthe presence of the terrible Ezzelin, the feudal enemy of Padua; they\r\nhave heard him command the tyrant to set his captives free; they have\r\naccompanied the saint to his hermitage among the purple olive-hills\r\nabout the city; they have struggled and suffered and died with him, and\r\nhave rejoiced at last in his apotheosis and canonization. And then, the\r\nwar being over, the race of Ezzelin expelled, and the lords of the soil,\r\nthe Carraras, strong in power, they see how the holy body is brought\r\ninto the town to protect it for ever, and a fair temple is built above\r\nits resting-place to prove the people's gratitude to the power that set\r\nthem free. They press about the marble sarcophagus that holds his poor\r\nskeleton, and stoop and kiss the clammy surface with reverent looks, or\r\ntake the benediction from the hand of some neighbor who stands nearer\r\nthe shrine, and utter a petition for the coming year.\r\n\r\nSee that high-bred young girl in her simple black dress, with her nurse\r\nby her side, and her dark eyes bright and soft under their long lashes.\r\nIt is some sweet Bianca, who has left her home to escape sister\r\nKatharine's taunts and make Heaven knows what blushing vow at the shrine\r\nof the kind saint. See how her soft lips caress the feet of the bronze\r\nangel with the lilies in his hand. Do you mark those bold, black,\r\nhandsome eyes devouring her face from across the crowd of low-statured\r\npeasants? It is some wild youth from the university, you say? Ay, one\r\nLucentio of Pisa, a noble gentleman, whose father has sent him to Padua\r\nto study those parts of philosophy that treat of happiness. Bianca knows\r\nnot how near her fate lies--knows not that to-morrow the new master of\r\nmusic and languages will present himself at her father's door and try\r\nhis skill in translation, and carry off the sweet prize under the very\r\nbeards of the reverend wooers of Padua.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH OF SANT' ANTONIO.]\r\n\r\nOh horror! there comes sister Katharine! Blessed Virgin, help us to\r\nescape before she sees us, or there will be no peace in the house for a\r\nweek. Come, nurse! quick! And Bianca flutters off in affright, and is\r\nlost in the crowd.\r\n\r\nThere she comes, bonny Kate--a small, slight consequential person,\r\ndressed in a robe of that brilliant green of the northern Italian\r\npainters. She wants no nurse--not she! She would go from Padua to the\r\nfarthest country on Fra Paolo's map on the strength of her biting tongue\r\nand her snapping green eyes. \"Make way,\" she orders, \"you low, vile\r\nbrutes!\" and the peasants draw back and look askance at her, and the\r\nwomen mutter under their breath, and the girls laugh a low laugh. See\r\nher kiss her hand and lay it on the marble. She will not touch her lips\r\nto it for fear of contamination. She hurls an angry oath at the\r\nmarket-woman standing near with her hens tied up in her kerchief,\r\nbecause she crowds so close that the hungry birds peck at the silver\r\ngalloon of her sleeve. Ay, pretty Kate, you are arrogant now. But wait a\r\nlittle. Here comes Petruchio, a most unwholesome sight for a summer's\r\nday. Get thee gone in haste, fair Kate!\r\n\r\nSee how he stalks on through the crowd, with his riding-whip in his\r\nhand, now cutting good-humoredly at a small boy's legs, now playfully\r\nthrottling a ruddy peasant-girl with the long lash. His clothes are\r\ntorn and muddy. He wears a new hat and an old jerkin, and a pair of old\r\nbreeches, thrice turned. He has ridden into town on the sorriest nag\r\never bred on the plains of Lombardy. See him stride up to the shrine of\r\nSant' Antonio. Do you think he will kiss that filthy stone, with the\r\nimpress of so many foul mouths upon it? He cuts at it with his whip\r\nuntil the people start back in affright and the wind blows half the\r\nlamps out, and the priest would gladly launch a malediction at his head,\r\nbut that he knows his man, for Petruchio's pranks with the clergy are\r\nthe talk of all Padua.\r\n\r\nHe is the delight of the university lads, this mad fellow from Verona.\r\nSee how they crowd about him as he stalks down the nave, and crave a\r\nlook or a salute from their bully hero! They lay bets in lecture-hours\r\nas to whether he will succeed in taming that young shrew, Baptista's\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nBe sure the Moorish prince and he of Arragon stopped with their trains\r\nto ask the saint's protection when they went to woo fair Portia. And the\r\nlady herself, after that good deed done in Venice, when she went praying\r\nabout at holy crosses, craved the saint's blessing on her lord,\r\nBassanio. He too, I wager, meditated here on his lady and his friend.\r\nThey crowd, a shadowy multitude, about the gleaming sepulchre under the\r\ncrimson glow of the silver lamps.\r\n\r\nWe wandered on, past the carved chapel-gates, the wrought bronze lamps,\r\nthe incense-clouds and the silver-white lilies, out into the tomb-filled\r\ncloisters. There they lie, cheek by jowl--old professors from the\r\nuniversity in cap and gown, high up under the arches; old warriors in\r\narmor, with their griffins and lions at their feet, and slaves bearing\r\nscrolls with their names and exploits registered thereon. Old\r\ncouncillors and syndics in robe and ruff, noble women in veil and coif,\r\nlie side by side with some brave young heart that shed its life's blood\r\nfor united Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PADUAN CAFFÉ.]\r\n\r\nOld dragons and monsters and wide-mouthed cherubim leer down from the\r\ngray sepulchres. From under the pointed arches, blossoming with\r\npalm-leaves and sweet stone child-faces, young painted angels,\r\nsoft-eyed, long-haired, in pink and blue robes, smile down from the gold\r\nbackground, with emblems of resurrection in their hands, like flowers\r\nspringing from the dust beneath. Here and there, high up under the\r\ncornice of some old Gothic tomb, is a round-eyed frescoed Madonna\r\nwatching the slumbers of an old knight whose bed-curtain is upheld by\r\nlong-armed saints. Pompous and grim and fantastic and sullen by turns,\r\nthese tombs would make the heart of the stranger ache with their\r\nmockery, but that the living sunlight streams athwart the hard stone\r\nfaces and the monster heads, and in the quadrangle of the cloister the\r\nlilies are standing like white-robed heavenly hosts, and a well upheld\r\nby angels rises up from the rank meadow-space. The purple clover runs\r\nriot among the grass. There is humming of bees about the golden\r\nlily-hearts, and a red butterfly loses its way now and then among the\r\ngraves.\r\n\r\nThere is the rustle of ghostly garments in the silent air--the fall of\r\nshadowy feet upon the grave-lined pavements. A white-robed, shining\r\nmultitude of philosophers and sages is for ever pacing up and down the\r\nsunny gallery discoursing of great and high things, like the blessed in\r\nthe _Paradise_ of Dante. A goodly company were they who walked there of\r\nold. Here came Giotto, pale-browed and thoughtful, discoursing with his\r\nfriend, old Pietro di Abano, wizard, astrologer and learned physician,\r\nof the designs he was to give him for the frescoing of the new Palace of\r\nReason that the city was erecting. With them, perchance, walked the\r\ngreat Tuscan, for he knew and loved them both, and all three, the seer,\r\nthe poet and the painter, brooded over the inner forces of Nature and\r\nbared their souls to revelation. Hither came Petrarch, worn with the\r\npomp of courts, yet flushed with modest pride at the new clerical\r\ndignity conferred upon him by his friend the Carrara, looking back upon\r\nhis past life with philosophic calm, bidding no man judge the day till\r\nthe evening be past, yet now and again feeling the old waves of passion\r\nsurge through his heart, breathing a prayer for the repose of his dead\r\nlove and a sigh for those sweet, far-off days of his youth. Here Tasso,\r\nthe beautiful young dreamer, escaping from the dull round of the\r\nuniversity, threw himself down in the clover beside the angels of the\r\nwell, and saw fair white women with golden hair wreathing their arms\r\nabout him, while the bees and the butterflies laughed aloud and cried,\r\n\"Poor fool! he does not know they are only lilies.\" And Galileo,\r\nteaching the while the dull youth of the school, came to gather strength\r\nin the thought of the great finality that was to lay him low beyond the\r\nreach of the Inquisition, and yet lift him far above all human grandeur\r\nto mate with the stars that had been his comfort through long years of\r\npain. Great Paolo Sarpi, when he came down from Venice in his monk's\r\ndress to discourse with the learned men of Padua, wandered here with his\r\nmind intent on the mighty problems of the universe, all unthinking of\r\nthe assassin's knife that was to ease the jealousy of the Roman\r\ncardinals. Here wandered the apprentice-boy Mantegna, poor and humble,\r\nstealing timidly in behind the furred gowns and the gilded chains to\r\nfeast his poor little artist-soul upon the frightened young Madonnas and\r\nwide-eyed angels that look out timidly from the arches of the\r\nsepulchres. What grand old phantoms glide on by the side of the laughing\r\nstudent-lads, and the old market-women in red kerchiefs who tell their\r\nbeads in corners, and the young girls who gather the long stalks of\r\nseed-grass from the quadrangle and whisper to them timid questions\r\nconcerning their absent lovers!\r\n\r\nOn the great square in front of the church were booths filled with\r\nbright flowers and early fruit and cheap sweetmeats, at which the\r\npeasants were haggling and chaffering and filling their blue\r\nhandkerchiefs. The saints and prophets raised their hands in blessing\r\nfrom the blossoming spires. Over the way, in the inn of the \"Two White\r\nCrosses,\" the farmers were dining. The laughter floated out through the\r\nopen windows, and a man appeared at the door and scattered cherries to\r\nthe crowd. By the side of the church was a great sepulchre, horrible\r\nwith demon-heads and pictures of the sinners in Purgatory. Above the\r\nheads of the crowd, high on a pedestal, sat a bronze warrior on a fiery\r\ncharger. It is old Gattamelata, the _condottiere_ of the Venetian forces\r\nin the long wars with Padua. His body lies within the church, and his\r\neffigy is the work of one Donatello, famous in Tuscan art.\r\n\r\nWe followed the crowd along the white-walled street to the great\r\nmarket-square the people call the Prato della Valle. In the middle was a\r\ncircular space of meadow, with trees above it, surrounded by a moat,\r\nabove which stand life-size statues of warriors and poets and nobles and\r\nphilosophers, blackened with the damp and mould of centuries, the folds\r\nof their gowns battered and grass-grown, their noses missing, their eyes\r\nput out by stones in the well-nerved hands of riotous youth, their\r\nswords and sceptres broken short, their pointed beards snapped off into\r\nbluntness. All around the great piazza are arches with _caffès_ and\r\nshops under them. Off at one end rises the massive front of Santa\r\nGiustina.\r\n\r\nThe broad paved space between the arcades and the moat of the statues\r\nwas the scene of a horse-fair. The most miserable animals that the\r\nimagination can conjure up, all the gaunt, ghostly steeds that graze in\r\nthe pastures of legend and fable, were gathered there, neighing and\r\npawing as impatiently as their half-starved spirits would allow. Be sure\r\nPetruchio bought his famous steed at the horse-fair of Padua, and that\r\nhe tried the beast's speed, as these peasants do, by driving him round\r\nand round the statues, raising a cloud of white dust and scattering\r\ncrowds of girls and children, who screamed with terror and prayed that\r\nthe curse of Sant' Antonio might ever follow him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a sound as of kettledrums and cymbals and squeaking violins\r\nrose above the neighing and braying of the fair. In front of Santa\r\nGiustina were a circus and a wild-beast show and a crowd of lesser\r\njugglers and charlatans. Outside the circus-booth, high up on a\r\nplatform, stood the clowns in their dingy fleshings and faded scarlet\r\ntrunks. They blew furiously on great brass trumpets until their cheeks\r\nwere purple and nigh to bursting under all the ghastly chalk. There were\r\n_ballerine_ in draggled pink tarletan petticoats and low white bodices\r\nthat made their bony necks and brawny arms still browner by contrast.\r\nThey had honest, unpainted faces, and wore their hair screwed up tightly\r\non the tops of their heads. They bore traces of exposure to wind and\r\nrain. Their eyes had a kind of wistful look, as though they were tired\r\nof all this noise and foolery, and wished themselves back again on the\r\nold olive-farms with their toiling mothers. There was something in their\r\ndogged mouths and the resolute manner in which they thumped the big\r\ndrums and clashed the great brass cymbals that told of the threshing of\r\ngrain and the treading of the winepress. There were gorgeous matrons in\r\nthreadbare velvet and tattered lace head-dresses who cast glances of\r\nsweetness upon the unresponsive crowd, and cheered on the panting clowns\r\nto cry out at the top of their poor strained lungs, \"Avanti, signori!\r\navanti!\" Small lithe children clothed in pink tights, with jewelled\r\ncrowns on their heads, darted in and out among the curtains of the tent,\r\nand gazed with a royal air upon the open-eyed, wondering little\r\npeasants, rough-shod and clothed in homespun, who stood and worshipped\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNot far from the circus, under a wooden tent, a half score of monsters\r\nwere whirling round and round in mad rivalry--fishes with enormous\r\nmouths and mighty fins, like the terrible \"Orco\" of Ariosto; wild steeds\r\nwhose legs blossomed out into acanthus-leaves, like the old grotesques\r\nthat lurk under the ferns about the basins of the village fountains;\r\ngreat mysterious birds, with big eyes, and golden chains about their\r\nnecks; beasts with the heads of cats and the bodies of dogs, as\r\nmonstrous and fantastic a crew, full of high-colored, confused images,\r\nas ever rioted in the high-strung brain of some old _cinque-cento_\r\npoet. Each of these terrible monsters had its rider--some little\r\ngolden-curled child, who clung about the neck of a cat-headed dolphin\r\nand shrieked with delight at the danger. Some pale sewing-girl, with a\r\nturret of powdered hair above her soft face and her black shawl thrown\r\nlike a habit around her, sat erect on her white palfrey, and for a\r\nmoment held herself the equal of the great ladies of other times whose\r\nfaces looked down upon her from the corridors of the palaces to which\r\nshe went to carry home her work, and haunted her as she sat alone in her\r\nlittle chamber high up among the red roofs. Some straight-limbed\r\npeasant-boy, with a clear-cut face and a red flower in his hat,\r\nbestriding the black charger with fiery nostrils, felt his heart swell\r\nwith noble longing at some dim memory of the glorious deeds of the old\r\nwarriors of Padua that his grandmother had related to him many a\r\nwinter's night when the chestnuts were roasting on the hearth and the\r\nrain was rustling through the dead vine-stalks. To him every note of the\r\ncracked trumpet was full of intoxication: it meant war and love and\r\nglory and heroic deeds.\r\n\r\nThere are brown-faced women in tarnished spangles tumbling on squares of\r\ncarpet, with their children crouching patiently on the blue\r\nhandkerchiefs that contain the family wardrobe, waiting for their dinner\r\nto be earned. They are assisted by white curly poodles, with pink shaven\r\nlegs, solemn faces and long ears, which make them look like old Paduan\r\n_marchesi_ in powdered wigs. They make the circuit of the carpet on\r\ntheir hind legs, and jump through hoops, and pass the hat among the\r\nbystanders, and watch the sleeping babies, and carry the weight of the\r\nwhole family upon their meditative shoulders.\r\n\r\nThere are tame magpies that tell the peasant-girls' fortunes by choosing\r\nprinted slips of paper from a box, and others that predict the winning\r\nnumbers of next week's lottery. Now and then an old magician passes who\r\nhas horse-hair curls reaching to his waist, a green shade over his eyes,\r\nand carries slung about his neck a board on which sits a drugged cock\r\nor a great black cat. He consults his familiar for answers to the\r\nquestions that are put to him. The peasants form groups about the\r\ncharlatans and tumblers and ring-throwers, and the sunlight streams over\r\nthe happy, careless crowd with a blessing. How many of them know that\r\nwhere they stand the early Christians met their death with psalms upon\r\ntheir lips and the palm of martyrdom in their hands?\r\n\r\nThere was one among those early martyrs, a beautiful young maiden, named\r\nGiustina, whose life and death were full of such heroic loveliness that\r\nin later times a mighty church was raised in her honor near the spot of\r\nthe sacrifice. The bones of all her fellow-martyrs were collected and\r\nburied in a vault within the edifice. It is a great gray pile, cold and\r\nsolemn and austere, that rises dark behind the brilliant groups of the\r\nfair. On either side of the great staircase crouches a stone monster,\r\nsome mysterious symbol of the early faith. Tradition gives them the\r\nnames of the paladins Roland and Oliver. The one clasps the figure of a\r\ncrusader between its mighty paws--the other, some mystical four-footed\r\ncreature. They look down upon the merry crowds with solemn unwinking\r\ngaze, large-eyed and mysterious. They seem to put the old riddle of the\r\nSphinx to the traveller who pauses by their side to watch the surging\r\nwaves of human life that beat against the broad stairway of the church.\r\nThe seal of the centuries is on their broad brows. They have looked down\r\nupon battle and tournament, upon success and defeat, upon life and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Prato is a stirring Italian epic, some heroic\r\n_Orlando_ or _Gerusalemme_, with undertones of mirth and satire. There\r\nthe Paduans held their masques and holiday-shows; there rose the mighty\r\ncastle that was stormed on a feast-day by armed men with missiles of\r\noranges and pomegranates; there stalked Donatello's mighty wooden horse,\r\ntowering high above the crowd in the Carnival cavalcades; there, after\r\nEzzelin the Terrible had for years enriched the ground with Paduan blood\r\nand hung the Paduan bodies high on gibbets, the freed and happy people\r\ncelebrated the expulsion of the tyrant by instituting the famous\r\nhorse-races, in which the prizes were scarlet cloth and gloves and a\r\nsparrow-hawk. Hither came Charlemagne and Barbarossa to witness the\r\ngames held in their honor. Fairs and shows and Carnival riot have been\r\nthe lot of the Prato from the days when the nuns of Santa Giustina sold\r\nit to the town, until now when the Paduan ladies drive around the\r\nweatherbeaten statues of a Sunday with mighty towers of hair on their\r\nheads and enormous fans screening their faces. But there were times when\r\nthe Prato echoed with the noise of battle. Blood flowed through the moat\r\nabout the statues swifter than the sluggish waters of to-day. What\r\nstern, mighty figures have that Prato for their background! Alaric the\r\nGoth, Attila, Ezzelin, all fought with the rebellious Paduans on those\r\ngray stones. All the Venetian generals and the princes of old Verona and\r\nthe terrible Visconti of Milan--all have left the traces of their iron\r\ntread upon the patch of meadow where the pink daisies open their eyes,\r\nand the red clover calls to the bees from the base of the dingy statues,\r\nand the boys lie on the grass and play at _morra_ or sit for hours with\r\ntheir bare brown legs hanging over the moat fishing for the infant\r\nminnows. What wonder that the great square echoes with battle-cries and\r\nthe clash of steel! There is another echo, lower and more feeble, but\r\nyet more ominous, for it is the echo of the plague-bell. I can hear it\r\nabove all the noises of battle and tournament and Carnival mirth that\r\nhaunt the Prato. For the old chronicles tell us how in the war with\r\nVenice the starving, the plague-stricken, the dying lay in heaps upon\r\nthe flower-starred turf of the Prato. At midnight the death-cart made\r\nits round about the square, the muffled tread of the horses' hoofs\r\nmingling with the moaning of the sick and the wailing of the wind\r\nthrough the ghostly trees above the statues. The darkness was broken but\r\nby the light of a lantern fastened to the shafts of the cart, which\r\nthrew the white-faces into ghastly relief. Black-robed figures, silent\r\nand prayerful, passed in and out among the stricken groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTA GIUSTINA.]\r\n\r\nOf all the tragic episodes connected with the Prato, there is none that\r\ncontains such elements of warm vital interest or extorts from us such\r\nsorrowful sympathy as the history of Francesco, the last of the\r\nCarraras. The old Italian chronicles are written with such sublime and\r\npathetic simplicity that human life after centuries rises up before us\r\nwith all its warm joys and sorrows, delights and agonies. We see him\r\nfirst, this gallant Francesco, as a youth returning home in triumph from\r\na victory over the Scaligeri of Verona, welcomed by his old father, the\r\nlord of Padua, there on the Prato, amidst the rejoicings of the people.\r\nThen we see how, when Padua had fallen into the hands of the Visconti,\r\nthe old Francesco was kept a prisoner at Monza. His son, Francesco II.,\r\nwas also held in bondage by the Milanese, but his proud heart revolted\r\nat the thought of his slavery, and he compassionated the sufferings of\r\nhis country, for the Visconti were hard, stern rulers. He asked\r\npermission of the Visconti to reside in Asti, which lay near the\r\nfrontier of the Milanese territory. A little later he quitted the town,\r\ndisguised as a pilgrim and accompanied by his wife and two servants,\r\nunder pretext of visiting the shrine of Sant' Antonio at Vienne in\r\nFrance. The emissaries of the Visconti follow him to Avignon, where he\r\ntreats with the pope in person and by letter with other influential\r\npersonages. Having obtained promises of assistance, he returns to Italy\r\nby way of the coast. Moneyless, friendless, dreading arrest at every\r\nstep, burdened with a sick wife, Francesco knocks at the gate of Genoa.\r\nThe haughty city favors the Visconti, will have nothing to do with the\r\nwanderer, and threatens him with the dungeons of the ducal palace. So\r\nthey follow the coast down to Pisa, the wife almost dead with fatigue\r\nand privation, for they are often obliged to walk all day, and no\r\npeasant is bold enough to offer them assistance. At last, one of their\r\nservants, by much diplomacy, procures a miserable nag and a shaky\r\nmarket-wagon filled with straw, and in this state the outcast rulers of\r\nPadua drive up to the gates of Pisa. They are refused admittance, and\r\nwander sorrowfully on. Outside the town they chance upon a deserted\r\nhovel. How these princes praise God for his goodness, for now Madonna\r\nTaddea can have a night's rest on the straw in the corner! One of the\r\nservants steals back to the town and bribes a shopkeeper to sell him\r\nbread and meat and wine. They build a fire and warm their poor\r\nweatherbeaten limbs, and are right merry in a desperate, reckless way.\r\nWith the morrow they take up their march, and at last reach a friendly\r\ncity, where the wife rejoins her children. Francesco is provided with\r\nmen and arms to enable him to attack his native town, which is ready to\r\nwelcome him back. He assaults the city one midnight, surprises the\r\nMilanese, is welcomed by the Paduans with the old shout, \"Viva il\r\nCarro!\" and at dawn is encamped in triumph upon the Prato. He ruled for\r\na long time wisely and well, for he had known the discipline of life,\r\nand had hungered and thirsted like the lowest of his subjects. How he\r\nmust have laughed, this stately soldier banqueting in his palace-halls,\r\nat the thought of the night when he had been so thankful for that bit of\r\nbread and drop of wine snatched from the grudging Pisan! And Madonna\r\nTaddea, a blooming matron, surrounded by her children, laughed with the\r\ntears in her eyes, and told them how one of their number had come near\r\nbeing born not in a manger like our Lord, but in the open fields.\r\n\r\nBut a terrible fate hangs over this princely house. Francesco is accused\r\nby the Venetians of violating a treaty, and war is declared against him.\r\nThe flower of the Venetian army, led by the bravest of the Venetian\r\ngenerals, is sent against Padua. There is a long, fierce struggle. In\r\nspite of famine and plague, Francesco holds out to the very last, but\r\none night the Venetians scale the walls and build their camp-fires on\r\nthe Prato. Francesco, with his two sons, Jacopo and Francesco, is loaded\r\nwith chains and carried to Venice, and lodged in the dungeons of the\r\nducal palace. There is the mockery of a trial in one of those great\r\npainted rooms, but there is only one opinion with regard to the sentence\r\nthat will be pronounced against them. It is a terrible sight, the\r\nproclamation of that judgment to the prisoners, nearly blind, wan and\r\nhalf dead in their cells under the canal. When the executioner prepares\r\nto read the fatal document one of them rushes at him and throws his\r\nstool at his head. When the day of execution comes they embrace one\r\nanother, and Jacopo writes a letter to his wife, which the tenderness\r\nand sorrow of the chronicler have handed down to us, bidding her pray\r\nfor his soul and love their children. Then they are placed upon wooden\r\nchairs in their several dungeons, with their backs toward the door. The\r\nexecutioner jerks a silken cord about their necks, and the race of the\r\nCarraras has vanished from among the rulers of the earth. Their bodies,\r\nwrapped in velvet cloaks and adorned with golden spurs, are laid in\r\ndifferent churches, but their graves are nameless and the memory of the\r\nold heroic lords of Padua is branded with shame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRATO DELLA VALLE.]\r\n\r\nWe wandered on with the holiday crowd through the narrow arcades.\r\nAgainst the pillars leaned little stalls and booths where were sold\r\nfruit and fried cakes and hard gingerbread and crucifixes and rosaries\r\nand lives of the saints and veils and ribbons and fans and silver\r\nhair-pins. The young peasant-girls, strolling up and down under the\r\narcades, some in groups, some clinging timidly to their lovers' arms,\r\nstop at the booths and glance wistfully at the pretty trinkets, and end\r\nby buying a life of Sant' Antonio for the old mother who has stayed at\r\nhome among the olives, and a clay pipe for the old father taking his\r\nholiday rest on the doorstep by her side. They form bright pictures\r\nagainst the open archways of the palaces beyond, through which the young\r\ngreen of the gardens gleams in the sunlight. There is an air of mystery\r\nand reserve about these broad gateways which contrasts well with the\r\nhonest, gaudy street-life under the arcades. One of these palaces may be\r\nBaptista's, and within the unwelcome wooers of his daughters may be\r\nfeasting with him or sauntering arm-in-arm through the young leafage of\r\nthe garden, flouted by saucy Kate and shunned by sweet Bianca.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the brown-faced peasants were the students, who\r\nstrolled by in groups with a lordly air of possession or gathered in\r\nknots at the street-corners and waxed loud in discussion. They were\r\nlithe, slender, handsome fellows, with dark eyes and fair skins and oval\r\nfaces. They had that nameless poetic grace which is the birthright of\r\nall young Italians. The soft feminine beauty of these young Paduans,\r\nwith their dainty dress and pretty girlish ways, was something akin to\r\nthe sleepy grace of young lions. Watch that group at the corner waxing\r\nhot over some wrong done to the leaders of their party--some one of\r\ntheir political heroes arrested and cast into prison for uttering the\r\nthoughts of all just men. See their eyes flash, their hands move in\r\nanger and grope instinctively toward the place where they wore their\r\nswords in their year of service. Do you say that the old Paduan flame\r\nhas died out of these young hearts? They are of the same temper as the\r\nhearts that held out against the Venetian, the Visconti, the pope\r\nhimself--that made a hedge for the Austrian bayonets to pierce, and\r\nyielded life and fame and fortune for their country's sake, and\r\nlanguished in the hundred prisons of the northern tyrants, and were\r\nlifted up at last in one great glad shout of victory. Let those\r\nbattle-fields among the olive-farms on the hills outside the gates tell\r\nthe story of the Paduan students. Their bright youthfulness was like\r\nsunshine warming the gray old walls of the town. The romance of the old\r\nItalian life seemed incarnate in their graceful shapes. Such heads as\r\ntheirs gleam out from the dark canvases that hang high in the corridors\r\nof the old palaces--sometimes as the portrait of a long-forgotten young\r\nknight; sometimes in the guise of a warrior-saint, some George or\r\nMichael, painted by a master hand; sometimes as a beautiful young\r\nascetic in his monk's dress.\r\n\r\nIs it strange that the pretty peasant-girls cast shy veiled glances at\r\nthe young lads that stroll by with a careless stare? For centuries they\r\nhave given pledges and broken them there under the dark arcade, and so\r\nthey will do for centuries to come. There will be other holidays and\r\nother prayers at Antonio's shrine, and other girls will have ribbons\r\nbought for them at the booths, and then there will be a couple of kisses\r\nand a parting and a few tears, and now and then a broken heart. The\r\nyoung men will take their diplomas and go out into the world, and rush\r\ninto the turmoil of the state and the senate and the court, and lose the\r\nproud heroic bearing of their youth in cringing and fawning; or they\r\nwill settle down on their estates and marry the Marchesa Tal Quale, who\r\nwill have many quarterings and many bank-notes, and their beautiful\r\nGreek outlines will disappear under the weight of fat proper to a landed\r\nproprietor. The grand ideals of their youth will drop away from them one\r\nby one, and they will laugh with contempt at their old student notions\r\nof liberty and freedom for high and low.\r\n\r\nOnly some morning, when the children tell them it is Sant' Antonio's\r\nDay, an old pain will rise in their hearts, and they will see the dear\r\nold arcades of Padua and the little gay booths, and trustful eyes and\r\nfresh girl-faces will start up in their memories; and when the\r\nchurch-bells ring out they will hide their heads from the _marchesa_ and\r\nthe _marchesini_ and cry out aloud for the old happy student-time, when\r\nlove and hope of glory and high belief in God and man were theirs. God\r\npity them, those poor young things, in spite of all their glorious\r\nyouth! The beautiful promise of their spring will ripen into dull\r\nmediocrity. They will learn to be false to themselves and the truth.\r\nHappier are they who die there in old Padua in the fulness of their\r\nyouth and hope, and are borne to the great hall of the university and\r\nare laid on the black-draped bier, with candles burning about them and\r\ntheir fellow-students rising from their seats and bowing three times\r\nbefore the corpse, and reading the funeral eulogy of him who is going to\r\nhis grave with the spirits of the great and good that have left their\r\nfootprints in the solemn halls for his mourning train.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIAZZA DELLA ERBE.]\r\n\r\nIn the vestibule of the university, high up on the walls, hang the\r\nescutcheons of the more famous of the students of past centuries, gray\r\nwith age and mould and cobweb. What colossal figures stalk about the\r\nquadrangle and along the overhanging galleries! The mightiest minds of\r\nEurope are among them. Every footfall makes an echo across the\r\ncenturies. Yet of all the old shadows, the one that has the greatest\r\ncharm for me is that of the gray-haired serving-man who steals along the\r\ngallery with the bundle under his arm. Do you say it is only the\r\nsunlight lying athwart the arches? I tell you it is Portia's faithful\r\nservant, and he has been to the university to seek Doctor Balthazar, her\r\ncousin, and has obtained from him a lawyer's cap and gown, and he is\r\nhastening home to Belmont, that his mistress may don them and reach\r\nVenice in time to save Antonio from the Jew's hands.\r\n\r\nSedate groups of students were seated on the terrace of the _caffè_\r\nopposite sipping beer in gentlemanly Italian fashion. Here and there\r\nsome honest burgher family, out for a holiday, was cooling itself with\r\npink ices after the pilgrimage to the shrine. The female members were\r\nclothed with garments of such exaggerated form and color that one sees\r\nat once why Petruchio, in spite of his madness, had wit enough left to\r\nsend to Venice for the wedding-clothes, and why Katharine, after the\r\natrocious fashions of Padua, was disposed to be content with anything\r\nthe Veronese tailor chose to offer her.\r\n\r\nWe sauntered on to where the afternoon sun flashed red against the great\r\narched windows of the Palace of Reason. It is a mighty stone edifice,\r\nwith a curved glass roof over the great justice-hall, which was the\r\npride of mediæval Padua. Under the pointed arches of the wide galleries\r\noutside are gathered gray old milestones and funeral tablets and antique\r\nbusts that carry the stranger back to the days of Latin legend, when old\r\nAntenor came up from the south and founded the city.\r\n\r\nOn the piazza, under the shadow of the beautiful loggie, the\r\nmarket-women are gathering up the bright fruits from the stalls and\r\nfolding their red umbrellas, and thanking the saint for a profitable\r\nfeast-day. A flood of yellow sunlight streams over the piazza, wrapping\r\nit about with a delicious drowsiness. No sound is in the air save the\r\necho of a footfall in some one of the dark streets behind or the yawn of\r\na weary fruit-seller. In the little _caffè_ under the arcades the idlers\r\nseem to have fallen into an enchanted sleep. Now and then a student\r\nsaunters by, gazing dreamily up at the graceful galleries. Tired mothers\r\nhasten across the piazza, dragging their tired but happy children after\r\nthem. The mothers are red in the face with the heat, their bonnets are\r\nnigh to falling off, and their mighty castles of hair are shaken to\r\ntheir foundations. The children's hands are filled with dead lilies and\r\nhard cakes, and their faces are aglow with melted sugar and happiness.\r\nThey have a weary air, as through surfeit of sweets. They will welcome\r\nthe work-day minestra to-night when they reach their homes high up\r\namong the terraces and the chimneys and the clothes-lines. Ah, well!\r\nSant' Antonio's Day is drawing to a close.\r\n\r\nThose children with the lilies in their hands carried me back to the old\r\nreligious masque of centuries ago. The chroniclers tell us that every\r\nyear, in the month of the Blessed Virgin, a procession formed here on\r\nthe piazza in front of the palace composed of all the civil dignitaries,\r\nthe priests, the nobles and the different guilds. At their head went two\r\nchildren beautiful as seraphim, the one dressed in snowy white, with\r\ngolden hair falling on his shoulders and a sceptre of white lilies in\r\nhis hand--the angel of the Annunciation; the other, clothed in a flowing\r\nblue garment, with long brown hair escaping from under her golden\r\ncrown--the Blessed Virgin herself. So they passed on, accompanied by\r\nmusic and the shouts of the people, through the streets of Padua, that\r\nwere hung with crimson arazzi and tapestry from the looms of Flanders\r\nand curtains of cloth of gold. Onward they went to the vineyard outside\r\nthe town, in which stands Giotto's chapel. At the gate the procession\r\npaused, and there was a colloquy in rhyme between the Virgin and the\r\nangel, and all the dignitaries listened with profound seriousness, and a\r\nmass was chanted within the chapel, and bombs were exploded, and bells\r\nrung, and there were singing and shouting and feasting throughout Padua.\r\n\r\nAfter all the gaudy brilliancy of the feast-day, after all the hot\r\nunrest of the streets and the stifling atmosphere of the churches, it\r\nwas pleasant to stroll toward the gray walls of the town in the late\r\nafternoon. The bells were calling from tower to tower. Along the\r\ngrass-grown streets no footfall save our own broke the stillness. Here\r\nand there a goddess or a couple of cherubs bearing an escutcheon smirked\r\nat us from the high garden-walls. Sometimes from within the wrought-iron\r\ngates came the rustling of trees or the plash of a fountain. We paused\r\nat a wide weatherbeaten door, rang the bell and were admitted by a brown\r\nsmiling contadina, who preceded us up the narrow path that had vines\r\nstretching out on either side, with flowering peas and beans climbing,\r\nall crimson and scarlet blossom, over the jagged stakes. The air was\r\nrilled with perfume and the eager buzzing of bees. At the end of the\r\npath stood a large square house, on the portico of which sat two\r\nblue-frocked peasants smoking and drinking red wine. There was a broad\r\npatch of green sward in front, on which three yellow-haired children and\r\na small tawny dog were rolling in play. Under the great fig tree at the\r\nside of the house sat three brown-faced women, two knitting, the third\r\ndressing her hair. There were cool shadows under the broad leaves of the\r\nfig tree, and bars of slanting sunlight falling through the foliage on\r\nto the grass. At the right of the house stood a little Gothic chapel\r\nwith the sunlight streaming across the threshold. On the arch of the\r\ndoor the birds were singing, and there was a growth of purple cabbages\r\nand kingly artichokes by the side of the chapel, and low in the hollows\r\nnear by lay patches of brake and fern.\r\n\r\nAt the sunlit threshold a woman sat sewing. Before her was a table with\r\nphotographs, and a stalk of lilies in a blue earthern pitcher upon it.\r\nThe sun streamed over the sunken pavement to the neglected little altar\r\nwith its coarse mosaics and paper flowers, over the rickety little\r\npulpit and the traces of Byzantine gilding, and over the quaint old\r\neffigy of the founder. It fell, soft and brilliant and caressing, on the\r\nfrescoes of Giotto. They were as pure and fresh and holy as the very\r\nlilies; and as the lilies revealed the innermost meanings of Sant'\r\nAntonio's Day to the hearts of the worshippers, so the frescoes\r\nsymbolized the deepest reverence, the hidden longing of the whole\r\nbrilliant, noisy Middle Age life of Padua. Their very crudeness, their\r\nnakedness, their barrenness of accessory, their sharp, brilliant\r\ncoloring, cause them to stand out in strong relief. Never did the\r\nmystery of Holy Writ receive better interpretation than at the hands of\r\nGiotto. The characters in the sacred writings stand out sharp, bold,\r\nnaked, crude, and Giotto caught the bare emotional and intellectual\r\nnature of every personage. He painted their souls and not their bodies,\r\nand therefore he painted well. Each character might stand for the\r\npersonification of some one emotion. What can be more full of sweetness\r\nand humble adoration than the Annunciation! what more awe-inspiring,\r\nmore faithful in its horror, than the miracle of Lazarus, where the\r\ncorpse, swathed in its bandages, stands upright among the multitude with\r\nits hollow eyes gazing in mingled gratitude and terror at the Saviour!\r\nwhat more full of grotesque sternness than the Last Judgment! what more\r\nnobly imagined, more faithfully executed, than the Last Supper! The\r\nsimplicity and sublimity of revelation shine down from them, and make\r\nthe beholder speechless with the thought of divine love.\r\n\r\nLet us go no farther. Let us end our holiday here. Under the altar\r\nsleeps the old knight who built the chapel, and outside the door the\r\npeasants sit upon the threshold of his palace. The butterflies saunter\r\nin on the sun-filled breeze and flutter about the lilies on the table\r\nand the painted lilies on the wall. The dark sweet faces shine down from\r\nthe frescoes, as they have shone down upon the worshippers through the\r\nages, with a blessing on their holy, sentient mouths. A deep reverent\r\nhush is in the air--a nameless expectancy fills our hearts. We stand on\r\nthe threshold of all that is best and worthiest in the human life of\r\ncenturies, with the shades of the great and noble pressing about us. The\r\nannouncing angel has brought unto us the lilies of revelation, and we\r\nfeel with glad humility that we are for ever one with all the high souls\r\nthat have joined earth with heaven.\r\n\r\n                                                CHARLOTTE ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LAW UNTO HERSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nA year after Laidley's death, Judge Rhodes, being in New York,\r\nbreakfasted with Mr. Neckart. He noticed that the editor had grown lean\r\nand sallow. \"And God knows he had no good looks to spare,\" smoothing\r\ndown his own white beard over his comfortable paunch. Something, too, of\r\nthat easy frankness which had made Neckart so popular was gone; no topic\r\ninterested him; his eye was secretive and irritable; he spoke and moved\r\nunder the constant pressure of self-control. The judge, as he watered\r\nhis claret, eyed the dark face opposite to him critically. \"Now, I\r\nnever,\" he thought, \"saw a sign of ill-temper or cruelty in that man.\r\nYet I have a queer fancy that if the reins were once taken off he could\r\nnot master himself again. It must be devilishly uncomfortable, holding\r\none's self in in that way,\" the last morsel of quail sliding down his\r\nthroat unctuously. \"_I_ can let myself out without danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you eat nothing! The campaign's been too much for you, Mr.\r\nNeckart,\" he said aloud. \"You've run down terribly in the last year.\r\nAlways the way. You young men make too many spurts in the first heat,\r\nand break down before the middle of the race. Well, that's our American\r\npolicy. But the American physique won't stand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you only mean that I have broken down physically, or do you see any\r\nchange in my work? The leading articles are mine, you know. Don't be\r\nafraid to be frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now that you ask me--Your articles are more forcible lately, more\r\npopular: they bring down the galleries, eh? But it's a sledge-hammer\r\nforce, it's vehemence, d'ye see? There's a lack of that moderation, that\r\nrepressed power, in which was your real strength. You asked me to be\r\nfrank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And I knew just what you would say. Well, what must be, is!\" with\r\na gesture which dismissed the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! It's your nervous system that needs toning, that's all. If\r\nour side goes in, get a foreign mission--some warm, lazy place on the\r\nMediterranean, say. Rest a few years, and when you come home take an\r\neasier pace for the rest of your life. Lord bless you, boy! I've been\r\nthrough it all. When I was a young fellow--mere bundle of nerves,\r\nhigh-strung, sir--high-strung! Ambition, love! Constitution wouldn't\r\nstand it!--Bit of the steak, John, rare.--Joe Rhodes, I said, either\r\ncome down to the jog-trot level or die. So here I am! Good for forty\r\nyears yet, please God! When you are my age you may be just what I am, if\r\nyou choose.\"\r\n\r\nNeckart's eye twinkled: \"Try the birds, judge.\"\r\n\r\nHe made an effort after that to resume his old careless manner, and the\r\njudge had tact enough to drop the subject. But he was not deceived.\r\n\"There's more here than meets the eye,\" he said shrewdly to himself.\r\n\"Neckart has had a blow that has made him stagger. He has worked like a\r\nhorse in a treadmill. But he has the constitution to stand it. Functions\r\nin healthy condition--tremendous vital power. Either hereditary disease\r\nis at work, or some morbid passion, or he would not have given way.\"\r\n\r\nHe urged him to eat with tender solicitude, even gave him his famous\r\nrecipe for a salad. No matter what our sympathy, our help for each other\r\ncan seldom come any closer than skin or stomach, after all.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" he said presently, \"I hear that Swendon has bought a place\r\nup the Hudson. Can you tell me anything about him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I meet him everywhere,\" said Neckart. \"The old man is failing fast. But\r\nhe takes life just as he always did--like a boy let loose for the\r\nholidays.\"\r\n\r\n\"And his daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"She never comes into town: she is not a woman of society.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember the little Swede was no favorite of yours,\" noticing a\r\ncertain reserve in Neckart's tone. \"But I had an object in asking for\r\nher. Of course you would not be likely to know much about them: they are\r\nout of your line.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have met the captain and his daughter several times during the year,\"\r\nsaid Neckart. \"They were camping on the Maine coast last summer, and I\r\nstumbled into their tent one day. Miss Swendon fancied her father would\r\ngrow strong on a diet of fish of his own catching. When the cold weather\r\nset in she took him to St. Augustine. I ran against him by the old fort\r\nthe very morning I arrived, and in the spring we met at Omaha, and made\r\nthe overland trip to California together. There is no kind of air and no\r\nkind of amusement which she has not tried, since she had the means, to\r\ngive the old man his health back again. To no purpose, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very odd!\" the judge nodded mysteriously. \"Very odd indeed about that\r\nproperty! Laidley told me the very night before he died that he had made\r\na will leaving it in charity. Now, Jane inherited by virtue of a will\r\nmade two years before. No other forthcoming. I suppose remorse seized\r\nhim _in articulo mortis_. There was a curious thing occurred in that\r\nlast interview of mine with Laidley.--How can I see Swendon?\"\r\ninterrupting himself. \"Where is their house?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neckart hesitated a moment: \"I am going there this evening to dine\r\nand spend the night, and I will take you with me. It will be a surprise\r\nwhich the captain will like.\"\r\n\r\n\"The very thing! Precisely! The truth is, Neckart--light a cigar--the\r\ntruth is,\" lowering his voice and leaning over the table, \"Laidley\r\nexacted a half promise from me that night which troubles me. The fellow\r\ndied forthwith, you see, and so clenched it on me. He had a plan for\r\nMiss Swendon's future, and asked me to forward it. I thought he was\r\ngoing to cheat the girl, and paid little attention to it. But he did\r\nthe clean thing after all, and then died promptly. I must say Laidley\r\nacted in a much more decent and gentlemanlike way than I expected. So,\r\nnow I feel as if I owed it to the fellow to keep my word.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neckart nodded. He asked no questions, but scanned the judge's\r\nflabby face narrowly. Rhodes lifted one leg on to the other knee and\r\nnursed it. It was his confidential attitude.\r\n\r\n\"It's a delicate matter, you see. Van Ness is concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Van Ness, the antiquarian?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's more than that! You don't suppose a man of his breadth of\r\nintellect confines himself to old bricks and dry bones? Why, God bless\r\nyou! Pliny Van Ness is the final authority in Philadelphia on new\r\nsingers or pictures or cracked teapots or great religious or\r\nphilanthropic reforms. If he were taken from it, the underpinnings of\r\nthat town would be knocked away, and it would fall flat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last fall, I think, I heard he had a plan for enforcing compulsory\r\neducation in Pennsylvania?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes. I don't know why that didn't pass. It died out. Van Ness was\r\ntrying, too, to establish a grand scheme for the benefit of the mining\r\npopulation. But somehow I haven't heard of that lately. Oh he's a great\r\nman, sir! When I hear him talk half an hour it quite lifts me up to\r\npurer air. I always say when I come away, 'Joe Rhodes, you're a selfish\r\nscoundrel! A selfish scoundrel!'\"\r\n\r\nThe judge smoked in silence a few minutes. \"Yes,\" he resumed\r\nthoughtfully, \"it was about Van Ness. Poor Laidley had that reverence\r\nfor him which men of his calibre are apt to have for a character of\r\nperfect excellence, and in his anxiety for Jane he planned that a\r\nmarriage should be brought about between them. I was to inaugurate the\r\nmatter--bring them together. Easily, naturally, you understand? The sort\r\nof thing that is done every day. I've seen excellent matches made in\r\nVirginia by a little quiet management of friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It is done every day.\" Mr. Neckart yesterday would have talked of\r\nthe marriages of half the women he knew as \"good matches\" or \"well\r\nmanaged\" without knowing that he was vulgar in so doing. But now the\r\nwhole idea struck him as loathsome and disgusting. Were women to be\r\nparaded before their buyers as in a slave-market? He looked at the poor\r\njudge babbling innocently as he might at some venal go-between in the\r\nmarkets of Cairo.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking the matter over,\" pursued the judge anxiously, \"it has\r\noccurred to me that Laidley would not have been so confident of Van\r\nNess's ultimate concurrence in the scheme unless Pliny had shown some\r\nprepossession in favor of the little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, the sultan is ready to throw the handkerchief?\" dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's a coarse way of putting it, Neckart. But, considered as a\r\nmatch, now, really, you know, Van Ness is--The idea that he was\r\nfavorable to it was suggested to me again yesterday when he proposed\r\nthat we should look up the captain and call upon him. He is not a man\r\nwho usually makes advances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Van Ness in New York with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly. I thought you knew that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you propose to take him out to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that seemed a good plan. Unless you have some objection?\"\r\n\r\n\"What objection can I have? What does it matter to me?\" He stooped to\r\npat his dog, that sat upright watching his face.\r\n\r\n\"Surely, that is that savage wolf-hound of Miss Swendon's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He divides his time between us.\" After a few minutes he said, \"You\r\nseem to anticipate no difficulty in the way of your conquering hero? Yet\r\nMiss Swendon by no means belongs to the warm-blooded, susceptible order\r\nof women. This Van Ness, as I remember him, is a starved,\r\ninsignificant-looking fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, on the contrary! He has a very noble presence. Pliny is tall, with\r\nmuch dignity of carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pompous, eh? 'I am Sir Oracle'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind. Rather deprecating manner, with a calm face,\r\nbeaming blue eyes, and abundant fair hair and beard. The very finest of\r\nSaxon types, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah? But these reformers are apt to be underbred, irritable, with nasty\r\npeculiarities of habits and manner which they never have thought it\r\nworth while to cure. I suppose your friend is like his brethren?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Neckart, just wait until you see Van Ness. You'll be charmed, or\r\nI've no judgment. Most men are, and all women,\" laughing significantly.\r\n\r\nThey rose at the moment. As they left the room Neckart caught sight in a\r\nmirror of his own dwarfed bulk and the massive head set in its black\r\nmane. He stopped and looked for an instant at himself fixedly, a thing\r\nwhich he had not done perhaps for years, and then walked on in silence\r\nbeside the judge. When they parted in the street he wrote a line on a\r\ncard and gave it to him.\r\n\r\n\"In case I am not able to go out on the same train with you, this is the\r\nroute to the farm,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe could scarcely be courteous. He was in a rage of indignation. Not, of\r\ncourse, that it mattered to him whether Jane married this or any other\r\nman whom she loved. She was only an acquaintance--more perhaps--his\r\nlittle friend. She must marry: he had thought of that often; and she\r\nwould love--with a strength and fidelity beyond that of any woman he had\r\never known. He had often thought of that too. When the time came--years\r\nhence, perhaps--he would consult with her father as to the man. They\r\nmust be satisfied that he would make her happy--they two. It must be a\r\ncareful, cautious, slow matter. He might surely claim so much of a\r\nguardianship over her! He had studied her character very carefully, and\r\nappreciated it as a rare and delicate one; and he was very fond of the\r\ncaptain--very fond of the captain. But as for the plan of marriage--Mr.\r\nNeckart understood his own disgust at the judge, and accounted for it\r\nnaturally. He had but little of the ordinary chivalric belief in woman's\r\nmodesty and purity. Much knowledge of female lobbyists and literary\r\ntramps and champagne-tippling belles had shaken his faith, probably.\r\n\r\n\"But this girl is the most innocent, sincerest thing God ever made,\" he\r\nsaid. \"She is clean in thought and body and word.\"\r\n\r\nIn those long days on the Maine coast, or by the sea-wall at St.\r\nAugustine, or crossing the interminable mountain-ranges or alkali\r\ndeserts, he had had time to read this candid soul page by page: her\r\nclear skin and liquid eyes were not more transparent than her thoughts.\r\nAll through that day's work a young noble figure moved like a shadow--a\r\nwoman with the brave blue eyes, the ruddy lips, the grand\r\nunconsciousness of the great women of her race. The blood of Aslauga and\r\nIngeborg was in her veins. So strong was this feeling upon him, that\r\nalways, when he was making ready to meet her, he bathed and arrayed\r\nhimself as if he was going to take part in the rites of a church or some\r\nsacred place. \"'So white, so fair, so sweet was she!'\" he sang softly to\r\nhimself. And guzzling Rhodes, with his oily laugh and fat hands, meant\r\nto show her off, exhibit her fine points to this Admirable Crichton of\r\nmorality, and persuade him to marry her! Was there any danger that she\r\nwould love or marry him? She was undoubtedly dull in perception of\r\ncharacter: had she not always made a demigod of the silly old captain?\r\nThe finest vessels were always first to break themselves to pieces\r\nagainst some earthen pitcher.\r\n\r\nHe made haste to take an early afternoon train. He would see his friends\r\nagain before Rhodes arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe Hemlock Farm, the captain's new possession, was a great untrimmed\r\ntract of farm and woodland on the Hudson, with a rough-hewn stone house,\r\nopen-windowed and wide-doored, uncivilized and picturesque, set down\r\nhospitably in the midst of it. Mr. Neckart, striking across the fields\r\nfrom the little station, caught glimpses through the forest for a mile\r\nor two of its walls and heavy chimneys stained with smoke and lichen.\r\nThey seemed to grow out of the ground as naturally as the oaks and gray\r\nbeeches.\r\n\r\nIt was a damp, cool day in June. Ragged patches of clouds were driven\r\ndown across the tree-tops; the dark blue of the sky had yet a tinge of\r\nmoist yellow in it after the night's rains; the wind was wet as it blew\r\nnow and then gustily in Neckart's face. He jumped across a brush hedge\r\novergrown with smilax and blackberry vines, and passed in under the\r\nhemlocks. They were dark and still. Outside, the sunshine flashed\r\nsometimes, pale and watery, and the blackberries in the hedge were\r\ngetting rid of their white blossoms and reddening their green knobs, and\r\na wild tiger-lily here and there blazed its answer to the summer; but\r\nthe old hemlocks, just as Neckart knew them when a boy, kept silence and\r\nnodded thoughtfully together, meditating over their ancient secret. He\r\nwalked more slowly. How long was it since he had left the office or sat\r\nin the club-room at breakfast with Rhodes's puffy face and unsavory\r\ntalk?\r\n\r\nWhy, even the hedge with its sleepy hum of bees and yellow butterflies\r\nseemed to be of the world, worldly here. He left it far behind. The\r\naisles of the wood grew higher and more solemn, and slowly filled with\r\npale-green light. The wind and rain last night had not reached these\r\nsolitudes, yet he climbed over fallen trunks rank with soaked emerald\r\nmoss and branching fungus yellow or red as coral. A lizard with bulging\r\neyes of jet darted across his foot: now came the whir of a partridge\r\nfrom under the dead leaves, now the veery cut the air with its fine\r\nsilver pipe.\r\n\r\nNeckart stood still and drew long slow breaths. The life of the woods\r\nwas like sleep to him; the air was marrowy, stimulating; he could feel\r\nhimself growing quiet and stronger in it. A moment later he drew his\r\nbreath deeper.\r\n\r\n\"She is coming!\" A tall, erect girl, bareheaded, came noiselessly down\r\nbetween the gray trunks of the trees, her feet sinking at each step into\r\nthe dead, ash-colored moss. Her color rose as she saw him, and her eyes\r\nlighted, but she put her finger on her lips. \"You have frightened them,\"\r\nshe whispered. \"They have all gone into their houses.\"\r\n\r\n\"They--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush-h!\" She sat down on a fallen log and motioned him to a place\r\nbeside her: then she waited, listening. There was a space of silence:\r\npresently a red squirrel came out overhead and darted along the limbs;\r\nthe ragged bark of the tree in front of them was suddenly full of\r\ncreeping things, busily hurrying up and down; the coffee-colored water\r\nof the brook at their feet began to glance with silvery flashes of\r\nminnows and wagtails; out of a miniature hill came a long procession of\r\nants; they marched, deployed, disappeared, and came again; monster\r\nspiders, like lumps of glittering enamel, swung in the air by invisible\r\nthreads; two black beetles rose to view by Neckart's foot, rolling a\r\nwhite ball twice as big as themselves toward a flicker of clear sunshine\r\non the grass.\r\n\r\n\"They are taking the babies for a sun-bath,\" whispered Jane.\r\n\r\nThe muffled hammering of a woodpecker, building its nest, came from a\r\nhollow tree at a little distance. A flock of kingbirds dashed\r\nboisterously through the underbrush. The pewees began their pitiful cry\r\nof \"Lost! lost!\" a scarlet tanager sat like a sentinel on a dead branch\r\nand challenged them with a sharp single note. The whole air grew full of\r\nthat strenuous, mysterious wood-sound which is next to silence--the\r\nvoice and movement of millions of living things too small for sight. It\r\nrose to a full orchestra as the two human listeners sat motionless,\r\nthough only a few notes were familiar to Neckart--the tic-tic of the\r\ngrasshoppers, the low monotone of countless unseen springs escaping\r\nunder the grass, the lone call of the thrush, a single minor note from a\r\ngolden bugle. But it was not the grasshoppers or thrush to which he\r\nlistened breathlessly: it was the soft breathing of the young girl\r\nbeside him, as she sat attentive, a quiet delight in her face, her blue\r\neyes gathering soft lustre. Nature, when she and the world were young,\r\nmight have looked with such motherly tenderness on all her living\r\nthings. Her large nervous hands were clasped about her knees: the yellow\r\nhair glistened close beside him, and as her full bosom rose and fell he\r\ncould hear her heart beat in the silence.\r\n\r\nHe stood up quickly with a shiver: \"Shall we go to the house?\"\r\n\r\nShe rose: \"Yes, if you will. They are learning to know me now. I come\r\nhere every day. There is a partridge lives under that bush, and he came\r\nout and actually let me see him drum once, and yesterday I found a\r\nblacksnake attacking a bluebird's nest in time to help fight the\r\nbattle.\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached the hedge: Neckart held apart the thorny bushes, but\r\ndid not give her his hand to help her through, as he would have done to\r\nany other woman. He was always scant in personal courtesies to her.\r\n\r\nShe looked back at the woods: \"Yes, there they all live and keep house,\r\nand marry and quarrel and die. It does not concern them at all what man\r\nyou make President, Mr. Neckart. It is very hard to make their\r\nacquaintance. I think they ought to know their friends at sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I know two human beings,\" said Neckart gravely, \"who,\r\nwhen they first met, felt a strong mutual antipathy, and now they--\"\r\n\r\nShe turned, looking keenly at him.\r\n\r\n\"They are good friends, Miss Swendon,\" looking into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. There could not be any better,\" putting out her hand frankly. He\r\nheld it but an instant, as he might have done a boy's when offered to\r\nhim; but as she turned away a soft lovely color dyed her throat and\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"There is so much wild mint growing here,\" she said incoherently,\r\nstooping to gather it, \"and pennyroyal, and a plenty of sweet basil. I\r\nam going to have an herb- and seed-room, and give out the seeds to Twiss\r\nmyself next spring. I have not told you any of the news. Father has\r\nslept every night without a tonic. Don't you think his color is better?\r\nDid you see him yesterday?\" anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is better without doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite sure, now, we did the very wisest thing in coming here. The\r\nhouse is on an elevation, you see--above any chance of malaria--and then\r\nthe warm moisture from the river--just what he needs. And the going to\r\ntown--Do you often meet him in town? Is he enjoying himself? Did it\r\nstrike you that he was improving until I suggested it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it was only to-day,\" said Neckart, \"that I told Judge Rhodes how I\r\nmet Captain Swendon everywhere--at the club--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. _I_ urged him to join the club,\" her face beaming.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't have been a wiser move.--At the club, at dinners, at the\r\ntheatre, meeting old friends, taking in new life everywhere, and making\r\nnew life for everybody. Why, to see him on Broadway waving his hat and\r\ncalling 'Hillo!' to somebody across the street puts even the cab-horses\r\nin good humor.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed: \"I knew it, I knew it! And here on rainy days he has so\r\nmuch to do. He is trying every one of his patents in the house or\r\ngrounds. I am fitting up a billiard-room to surprise him on his\r\nbirthday. But come and I'll show you some of the patents at work. And I\r\nhave never showed you the barn or the orchard. Father will not be at\r\nhome until evening. He expected to meet you on the train. We can go\r\nexploring all the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThey crossed the meadow to the barn, Jane explaining that the former\r\nowner of the Hemlocks had lived for years in Europe, and left house and\r\nland to run into their present overgrown decay. \"Farmer and gardeners\r\nworry about new fences and repairs, but I will not have even the dead\r\nleaves cleared from the paths. I remember you said once you liked to\r\nhear them crisp under your feet,\" sliding her own feet among them.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the idle, purposeless afternoon which any practical\r\nman or woman would have thought worthy of an hour's remembrance; yet it\r\nstood out for ever after, above all of Bruce Neckart's life, as some\r\nfair table-land lifted from the fogs near to the sun.\r\n\r\nThey went into the house, examined patent hinges and locks, and\r\nexplored the vacant rooms and mysterious garrets filled with lumber. She\r\nsat down by an old spinning-wheel, turning it and singing a scrap of\r\nGretchen's song, while the light from the dormer window touched her\r\nwhite arched throat and yellow hair. They went to the stables, and the\r\nold Scotch hostler brought out the horses and talked with Neckart of the\r\nmysteries of flanks and strains of blood, while Jane looked on shyly,\r\nstanding with the dog in the wide door.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I shall know them as well as I do you some day, Bruno,\" she said\r\ngravely to him. \"But I shall never like them as well. That wouldn't be\r\npossible: they're strangers.\" The dog nuzzled his head into her hand and\r\nmarched steadily beside her. Then she took Neckart and Bruno over a\r\nlittle hill to a spring-house, into which you went through a mossy door\r\nacross a sparkling little brook. She went inside and brought out a bowl\r\nof yellow cream, all of them watching the kitchen windows guiltily as\r\nshe did it; and then they went on aimlessly across the stepping-stones\r\nin the brook up through the field of young corn until they skirted the\r\nbrush hedge again, when Bruno left them in pursuit of ground-squirrels.\r\nThere was a bank running along the river-shore, topped with nodding\r\nferns and purple iron-weed, and brown with the soft, feathery tops of\r\nthe mouse-ear. The bank was on one side, the water on the other, swift,\r\ndark, mobile, throwing back now a still belt of sunshine, now gloomy\r\nwoods, now the yellow shadows of low-driven clouds. They walked with the\r\nriver, not against it. The wind blew damp in their faces. Since Neckart\r\nhad talked so confidently of her father's improvement, Jane had been gay\r\nand light-hearted as a child, with a nervous quaver now and then in her\r\nvoice as if a word would bring the tears. She looked at him thoughtfully\r\nas they walked on.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to go to California again,\" she said abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"I can take tonics at home, if you mean that I need them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You are more worn and haggard than when we left Omaha. Every day\r\nof the journey I used to see how the wrinkles left your forehead, and\r\nyour eye cleared and your voice changed. It was the mountain-air. There\r\nis no tonic for you like the mountain-air.\"\r\n\r\nNeckart shifted his hat uneasily, and turned to look at the river as\r\nthough the frank blue eyes anxiously inspecting his face hurt him.\r\n\r\n\"I was harassed and perplexed then as to the policy which I should adopt\r\nfor the paper in a certain political question. My grim looks were no\r\ndoubt owing to that. You decided the question for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I? Why, I know nothing of politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But the choice offered me was between right and financial ruin on\r\none side, and a fortune and neutrality on the other. It would be\r\nimpossible,\" in a tone which suddenly became careless and matter of\r\nfact, \"for any man to come in contact with a nature as absolutely honest\r\nas yours, Miss Swendon, and not be influenced by it. I do not think I\r\nspoke to you at all of this question, yet it seemed to me that you\r\ndictated every step of my course. I never have told you of my affairs\r\nsince, yet every day I take your advice on them. It is always different\r\nfrom that of my political friends, because it is simply the broad truth\r\nand common sense. I follow it.\" He turned to her with one of his rare\r\nsmiles and an odd break in his controlled voice. \"I hold your hand in\r\nmine every step of my way.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not smile in return. She was standing still in the path, as\r\nthough she had been stopped by a blow. \"Honest? _I_ honest?\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe dog jumped up on her breast to go on with his romp. She pushed him\r\ndown, looking straight into Neckart's amazed face.\r\n\r\n\"You may have made mistakes: everybody is liable to do that,\" he\r\nstammered. \"But as for sincerity--\"\r\n\r\nShe drew a long breath as if throwing off a burden: \"No. I have been\r\nhonest. You are not wrong about me there. I have made no mistakes.\" She\r\nturned and walked on quickly.\r\n\r\nAs he followed her he observed for the first time how steady was her\r\nstep and how close set the finely-cut jaws. His own mouth, by the way,\r\nwas coarser, but more facile: it spoke when silent: the chin was cleft\r\nand sensitive.\r\n\r\n\"When she once makes up her mind, the verdict of the whole world will\r\nnot make her flinch,\" he thought with keen approval. The quality which\r\nhe had that very day damned as mulish obstinacy in one of his clerks was\r\ninfinitely alluring to him in this young girl. He came closer to her,\r\nwatching her averted face, a passion of delight and longing gradually\r\ndulling all past resolves or reason.\r\n\r\nIf she would but turn her eyes on his face again searching for signs of\r\ntrouble or illness! It was actually the first time in Neckart's life\r\nthat a woman had taken any care of him. His mother had been a burden and\r\ncharge on him since his boyhood. That single kindly glance had opened to\r\nhim unknown possibilities of tenderness, of the touch of a woman's\r\nfingers, and all that came to other men through them.\r\n\r\nBut she walked on without speaking, her head sunk on her breast. She\r\nseemed to have forgotten that he was in the world.\r\n\r\nAt a bend in the road they met the captain. He was heated and agitated,\r\nand tried to hide it by tremendous hilarity. He welcomed Neckart\r\nboisterously, shaking hands with him again and again before he turned to\r\nJane, who stood watching him with delighted eyes.\r\n\r\n\"How well you are looking this afternoon, father! Your cheeks are as red\r\nas a girl's!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm all right! Don't bother about me. Think of other people\r\nsometimes, child. Now, there's a matter I want to speak to you about, if\r\nI could only put it to you properly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready. Put it directly, point-blank: that is the best way in\r\ndelicate questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't laugh. It's no laughing matter. It's the most serious business of\r\nmy life, and I've only a few minutes to make you understand,\" mopping\r\nhis hot forehead with his handkerchief. \"The train will be due in half\r\nan hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"The train? Serious business? The commissioner of patents is coming?--\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn the patents! I beg your pardon, Jane. But really--This is a\r\nrequest I have to make of you. A request of you from poor Will Laidley.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew back. The weight which she had a moment ago thrown off fell on\r\nher again. \"A request of me?\" she said slowly. \"Whatever he asked me to\r\ndo I shall do. I owe him at least so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! You owe him everything. You know he might have left us\r\nwithout a penny, as he thought of doing. Instead of which, there was not\r\neven a legacy to any charity.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Every dollar of it came to me. I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Will behaved most generously, nobly, to you, there's no doubt of\r\nit! And this plan of his shows such tender care of you. I never heard of\r\nit until to-day from Judge Rhodes. God forbid that I should influence\r\nyou! But you would be sorry to thwart him in his grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not thwart him again.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I could put it to you properly now!\" The captain grew red and\r\ncoughed. Mr. Neckart looked at him with fierce disgust. Was he so brutal\r\nas to talk to any woman of her marriage with a man whom she had never\r\nseen?\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" he said coldly. \"Miss Swendon owes no gratitude for money\r\nwhich was justly her own. William Laidley, too, was a weak, impure\r\nman--the very last who should be allowed to stretch his hand out of his\r\ngrave to control any woman's life. You should not hamper her with any\r\nsuch gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot judge of this for me, Mr. Neckart,\" said Jane. \"He has the\r\nright, especially when it concerns his money.--What is it he wished me\r\nto do?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain stammered with embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Tut! tut! Money has nothing to do with it.--As for poor Will, Bruce, he\r\nhad his good points. _De mortuis_--you know. I knew him in his prime.\r\nIt's a trifle, after all,\" evading Neckart's eye, of which he had read\r\nthe meaning. \"But you are so apt, Jane, to take unreasonable prejudices\r\nagainst people. This is a friend of Will's, whom Judge Rhodes will bring\r\nout this evening. And it was your cousin's wish that he should be your\r\nfriend also--adviser, eh? I've no head for business, you know, and you\r\nmight refer knotty questions to him. Consult him about stocks, and the\r\ndrainage of the stables, and this and that,\" glancing at Neckart for\r\napproval of his delicacy and cunning. \"I only wanted to warn you not to\r\ntake an antipathy to him, but I am clumsy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" putting her hand to her eyes for a minute as though they\r\nached.--\"Come, Bruno. It is time to dress for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do, my dear. Haven't you any dress with frills and fal-lals, such\r\nas the ladies are wearing now? These clinging gowns do well enough for\r\nhome-folks like me and Bruce, but--Something airy, gay, now. It's only\r\nas an adviser that Will recommended Mr. Van Ness to you, you understand?\r\nYour cousin consulted him of late years in all financial matters. I do\r\nsuppose Van Ness--and Laidley too,\" turning to Neckart--\"would think the\r\nchild was flinging the money to the dogs, buying such a place as this to\r\nhumor her old father's whims.\"\r\n\r\nJane halted, her hands on the dog's collar: \"I will have no advice from\r\nMr. Van Ness, father, as to my disposal of the money. It is mine. No\r\nman, dead or living, shall interfere with my use of it,\" she said in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\"Now I've prejudiced her against him,\" groaned the captain as soon as\r\nshe was out of sight. \"I saw you thought me coarse in urging this matter\r\non her so abruptly, Bruce. But you do not understand. My time here is\r\nshort--God knows how soon it may end--and I can't bear the thought of\r\nleaving the child alone. Van Ness is so pure a man--a Christian whom all\r\nthe world reverences--What better can I hope than to see her his wife\r\nbefore I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"His wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Is there any objection to him? Be frank, Bruce. It is nothing to\r\nyou, but it's life and death to me. Van Ness told Judge Rhodes candidly\r\nthis morning that he had watched Jane since she was a child, himself\r\nunknown, and that it was his hope their acquaintance would deepen into\r\nsomething warmer than friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God! what a model lover! Stands off watching for years--weighs her\r\ncarefully in his scales. Item, so much amiability; item, so many pounds\r\nof healthy flesh; item, annual income so much. Then he steps in to\r\ninspect her a little closer, and if she prove satisfactory he will marry\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bruce, you're unjust. Every man has not your sensitiveness. The way\r\nthat Rhodes stated it there really was no indelicacy in it. Do you know\r\nany objection to Van Ness? Be candid. Have you any reason to urge\r\nagainst the marriage in case--?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neckart did not answer for a few moments. He had been smoking, but\r\nthe cigar went out in his mouth. \"No,\" he said at last. \"I have no\r\nobjection to urge to it. I have nothing to say. Go in, captain. The\r\ntrain is due now. I will follow you when I have finished my cigar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMiss Swendon, going up the wooded hill toward the house, raising her\r\nhead, saw a man coming toward her down the narrow path. The low sunlight\r\nstruck through the trees on his broad forehead and magnificent golden\r\nbeard flowing full on his breast. He was in evening-dress; a topaz\r\nblazed on his snowy shirt-front; he walked meditatively, his hands\r\nclasped behind him; his eyes rested on her with beaming pleasure. She\r\nturned her head away, but saw him, without her eyes, advancing upon\r\nher--coming, it seemed to her, into her life.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Ness's personality indeed was too potent to admit of his slying\r\nunnoticed, like an ordinary human being, in and out of anybody's vision.\r\nYou might look at him but for a moment, but his majestic port, the\r\nfineness of his linen, the very set of his high hat, his Christian\r\nbenignity and grace, remained with you ever after, a possession of\r\ncomfort and joy.\r\n\r\nJane knew him at a glance, though they had never met before. All of her\r\nlife she had heard Aristides called the Just, and been a trifle bored by\r\nit. Undoubtedly this was he. She was not petulant or bored now.\r\n\r\nIf we want a key to her feeling, we can find it in the fact that there\r\nwas not a moment since she burned the will that she had not known that\r\nshe was right in doing it, and that there was not a moment in which she\r\nhad not remembered that in the judgment of the world she was a thief.\r\n\r\nHere was the man sent by Laidley out of his grave to judge her, a man\r\nwho was embodied Virtue and Honor--in the world's eye.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently no doubt in Mr. Van Ness's mind, either, as to who\r\nthe slight erect woman might be who came slowly up the rocky path, one\r\nhand on the dog's collar, the folds of her blue dress falling about her\r\nlike the drapery of an antique statue, the coils of yellow hair only\r\nheld in place by a black velvet band. If he had been watching her growth\r\nfor years, as he said, waiting for this supreme moment, he gave no sign\r\nof emotion now that it had arrived, except that the radiance in his\r\nprotruding light eyes became more intense. I may as well say, once for\r\nall, that Mr. Van Ness never was known to yield to weak emotion,\r\nirritability or any of those vicious humors which beset other men. If he\r\nhad done so it would have grievously wounded the faith of his disciples.\r\nHe possibly had met these temptations in his cradle, as the infant\r\nHercules the serpents, strangled them and left them dead there, so\r\npassing into a serene boyhood and victorious middle age.\r\n\r\nBruno at this moment caught sight of the stranger, and began to growl\r\nominously. Now, the dog was an amiable, courteous dog ordinarily, but\r\nsubject, like his mistress, to irrational antipathies, and, like her,\r\nwith a large reserve of untamed blood to support his prejudices. He\r\nstopped, dropped his head between his fore legs, his eyeballs reddened,\r\nhe barked a short, sharp warning. Miss Swendon knew the signs: she had\r\nseen them once before. She caught him by the collar, looking straight at\r\nthe exceptionally handsome man with the underbred blaze of yellow on his\r\nshirt-front: \"Down! down, sir!--You had better go back,\" to Mr. Van\r\nNess. \"I beg of you to go back.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" gently, and still advancing. \"Poor fellow!--Let me catch his\r\neye, Miss Swendon.\"\r\n\r\nIt was something in the eye, however, which maddened the dog: he shook\r\nin every limb; his lips were drawn back; the sharp teeth glistened.\r\n\r\nJane threw herself on her knees, her arms about his throat: she motioned\r\nVan Ness back with her head, but the enraged animal threw her off as he\r\nwould a wisp of straw, and sprang straight at his throat. Van Ness,\r\nthough a heavily-built man, staggered back; but he caught the dog about\r\nthe throat with both hands, and held him as in a vise. The red eyeballs\r\nand panting tongue were close to his face. Next, Bruno struck with his\r\npaw at one of the white soft hands, and tore a great gash in it, from\r\nwhich the blood gushed; but the pleasant smile did not leave the lips of\r\nhis antagonist.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Swendon,\" he said gently, \"I think you can soothe him. I will\r\nhold him quiet to listen to reason.\"\r\n\r\nJane came to him, and in a few moments had the beast subdued and lying\r\npanting at her feet, his bloodshot eye still fixed on Van Ness. She was\r\npale and trembling, offered her handkerchief to tie up the wounded hand,\r\nand was humble in her apologies; but Van Ness knew all the while that\r\nher sympathies were with the dog. Judge Rhodes had heard the scuffle,\r\nand arrived now, out of breath, and violent in his abuse of poor Bruno.\r\n\r\n\"Why you keep such an ill-conditioned beast, Jane, I cannot understand,\"\r\nhe cried as he swabbed and tied the wound.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Ness beamed down unruffled on the stout little man: \"You are\r\nalways unjust to dogs, Rhodes. Now, I should say that our friend Bruno\r\nwas one of the Brahmin caste--fine-natured and well-bred as a rule.\r\nLiable to mistakes, perhaps.--I am right, Miss Swendon?\" and he beamed\r\ndown in his turn on Jane, who sat on the bank, stroking the dog's muzzle\r\nas it lay on her knee. She forced a smile which proved a failure, said\r\nthat he was right, and that she must hurry before them to the house. She\r\nstopped as soon as she was out of sight to hug the dog with a sob: \"But\r\nwe are not wild beasts, are we, Bruno?\"\r\n\r\nShe felt the dog's insane desire to tear off this amiability, this\r\ncloying gentleness of the newcomer, and find what was beneath. It was\r\njust as it used to be long ago when prim, polite little misses came to\r\nplay with her--white, pink-eyed poodles consorting with a big\r\nNewfoundland. She used to feel clumsy and worsted beside them, possessed\r\nby the devil too to scare and disgust them. Yet she knew herself more\r\nright than they all the time.\r\n\r\nWhen she sat at the head of the dinner-table an hour or two later, soft\r\nsilken drapery having taken the place of the soft woollen, and her usual\r\ncalm good temper on the surface instead of pallor and tears, her secret\r\nmood was very much the same. Mr. Neckart sat apart from her: he spoke\r\nlittle, and that only to the captain, who was eager about the political\r\nquestion of the day. Judge Rhodes, dropping his voice, poured into her\r\near eulogiums on Van Ness.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see him smiling down on that brute? Now, how did he know but he\r\nhad given him the hydrophobia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciated the self-control,\" smiling. \"So did Bruno. It drove him\r\nmad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Self-control? I tell you, it's super-human! I've thought sometimes it\r\nwas a divine power sustaining him. Why, I saw that man at his mother's\r\ndeathbed. She lay in his arms, and he sang to her--hymns, you know--sang\r\nto her in a clear, unbroken voice until her spirit had passed out of\r\nhearing. I couldn't have done it, even for a stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you could not,\" said Miss Swendon.\r\n\r\n\"He sinks self out of sight wholly, you see. Now, he had a dog once--a\r\nhound like yours--brought him up. It was touching to see them\r\ntogether--the devotion of the poor brute. Well, he sold him, and gave\r\nthe hundred dollars to his State Home for Children. He could not afford\r\nsuch a luxury as the dog's love, he said, while these poor wretches\r\nneeded so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my dog,\" said Miss Swendon quite distinctly, \"is more to me than\r\nall the wretches in Pennsylvania.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward silence.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Ness turned his handsome face on her with a benign nod: \"How\r\nnatural and beautiful that is! Her dog and her babe and her lover are\r\nmore to a woman than all the outside world. So they ought to be! Love is\r\nlike air: when it is confined it only fills a given space, but give it\r\nescape and it spreads over all God's creation. The day is not far\r\ndistant when young, fair women will freely give themselves to the work\r\nof raising the dangerous classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know about that,\" said Rhodes. \"I'm growing hopeless.\r\nWhat with ignorance and whiskey and conceit, the dangerous classes even\r\nhere are too heavily handicapped to make any running. They will need two\r\nor three lives after this, it seems to me, to bring them up to a fair\r\nstarting-point.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact!\" cried the captain. \"Now, there are beggars. My plan is\r\nto give to 'em all, and so be on the safe side; but the organized\r\ncharities tell us they are all impostors; and then every day some\r\norganized charity turns out a swindle! What is a man to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To do? Give himself up, I suppose, to the cause of the poor and the\r\nLord, as this man has done!\" cried the judge earnestly, touching Van\r\nNess on the shoulder, who shook his head and smiled--a sad, deprecating\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look for wages of any sort, then. If a man wants to be suspected\r\nby the rich and abused by the poor, let him take up my work,\" he said a\r\nmoment after, meeting Neckart's eye with a frank laugh.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you are right,\" said Mr. Neckart gravely. \"I never tried it.\"\r\n\r\nThey were rising from the table at the moment. As they passed through\r\nthe hall, Mr. Neckart halted beside a window in which grew some\r\nhouse-plants. Jane came directly to him. She had fallen of late into the\r\nhabit of consulting him in all her plans, as they both knew very well\r\nthat she was not at all a capable woman--according to the New England\r\nidea: she lacked acuteness and knowledge of facts and all the\r\nfashionable aptitudes. She had not even cognizance enough of Wagner or\r\ncloisonné or old andirons to put her _en rapport_ with her times.\r\n\r\nIt was a daily matter for her to appeal to Neckart to help her ignorance\r\nhere or there, yet when he heard the soft rustle of her skirts beside\r\nhim he grew perceptibly colder and stiffer, waiting without a smile for\r\nher to speak.\r\n\r\n\"I have brought my mind, as usual, to have it made up,\" she began gayly,\r\ngrowing instantly sober when she caught his glance. \"What do I want with\r\nthis ready-made Mentor? Do you think I need a financial adviser?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt you will find Mr. Van Ness both shrewd and honest in\r\nthat capacity, if you choose to consult him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I? I suppose the money is invested properly. I draw the\r\ndividends regularly, and I have no use for money but one. I mean to make\r\nmy father's life happy with it, and I know how to do that. Nobody can\r\nteach me. What have I to do with this reformer and his State Home?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neckart had been in the habit of looking down on her in her\r\noccasional outbursts with an amused indulgence as from an immeasurable\r\ndifference of years. He was looking down at her now with unsmiling and,\r\nas she thought, unfriendly eyes; but she was suddenly, for the first\r\ntime, conscious of how young he actually was, and how near to her in\r\nmany unworded, fathomless ways. She drew back within the narrow limits\r\nof the window, and was silent.\r\n\r\nHe withdrew his eyes from her with an effort, and did not immediately\r\nanswer. When he did, it was in a cool business tone. \"I do not know\r\nwhat relation Mr. Van Ness may hold to you hereafter, if any,\" he said.\r\n\"But he seems to me thoroughly honest and manly. He is the first\r\nprofessed reformer I ever saw who was not either subservient or\r\naggressive to me, as a newspaper-man who did not ride his hobby.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see him with your eyes,\" she said with a shrug. \"Bruno's,\r\nrather.\"\r\n\r\nNeckart laughed. After the manner of men, he had judged the man who was\r\ncrossing his life with calm common sense and justice, but he was quite\r\nsatisfied that the woman with neither should condemn him.\r\n\r\nThe late clear twilight lingered with a haze of red in the sky, although\r\nthe sun had been down for an hour or more. Jane stood irresolutely in\r\nthe window. Through the bushes she could see the stoop where her father\r\nand the judge sat smoking, Mr. Van Ness beside them, his benign,\r\nsheep-like gaze wandering slowly around in search of her.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he does not smoke!\" she said. \"He has not a single weakness\r\non which one can hang a liking; and he has actually taken father's own\r\nchair!\" which by the way she had cushioned herself years ago, when it\r\nand two small stools furnished their shabby room. No wonder that she and\r\nthe captain looked upon it as a sacred relic.\r\n\r\nThe window where they stood was shaded on the outside by privet and\r\nalthea bushes: it opened to the ground, and a sandy little footpath ran\r\ndirectly to the river, where her boat was moored. Usually, while the\r\ncaptain took his after-dinner nap, she rowed along the shore, and\r\nNeckart, when he was there, would sit in the stern reading or scribbling\r\nhis next leader, but oftener leaning back, his hands clasped behind his\r\nhead, listening with half-closed eyes to her chatter. It is significant\r\nto note the occasion on which a silent woman has a _flux de bouche_. The\r\nnecessity for talking was upon Jane at this moment. There were twenty\r\nthings which she must tell Mr. Neckart to-night--how the shoemaker\r\nTwiss, who used to live--or starve--in the alley back of their garden,\r\nwas here as head-gardener; and how capitally that consumptive\r\nsempstress, Nichols, managed the dairy and was growing quite fat at the\r\nwork; and how that boy in the stable, whom Neckart had brought from the\r\nprinting-office, where he was going headlong to the devil, had really\r\nturned out the best of fellows. The truth was, that there were very few\r\npeople who had been kind to Jane or the captain in the days when they\r\nwere all hungry together whom Neckart had not met at the farm, either as\r\nvisitors or settled in fat sinecures of office. He had arranged the\r\nbusiness part of their removal, indeed, in many cases. But he was in no\r\nmood for consultation to-night--answered briefly when she spoke to him:\r\nhis face, hard and inflexible, was turned toward the river. \"His mind is\r\nfilled with some matter of state--that Navy appropriation bill, I\r\nsuppose,\" she thought, looking at him deferentially. Her little affairs\r\nand thoughts fell back on her as if they had struck against iron.\r\n\r\nShe never wanted sympathy or advice from others: sometimes there were\r\nwhole days in which, her father being gone, she scarcely spoke a word.\r\nBut now, at the necessity for silence, her heart sunk with a miserable\r\nemptiness, her throat choked, hot wretched tears came up into her eyes.\r\nShe had thought all the week of this day, and she had kept the best of\r\nall she had to tell until this evening. She thought, of course, they\r\nwould go out in the boat, and now his mind was full of the Navy\r\nappropriation bill!\r\n\r\nShe pulled the white threads from the ragged cactus leaves beside her,\r\nlooking at him sometimes from under her lashes. \"I think I will go out\r\non the river,\" she said timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I push out the boat? The water will drift you without rowing,\"\r\ngoing promptly before her down the path. He took up the little anchor,\r\nwiped the seat of the bateau with the sponge, and held out his hand to\r\nhelp her in. She seated herself and took the oars. Surely he was coming?\r\nHe never had allowed her to go alone. No: he waited with one hand on the\r\nstern, and then pushed her off, taking off his hat as the boat darted\r\nout into the current and her oars struck the water.\r\n\r\nIt was the bill: no doubt it was the bill! She knew he had been sent for\r\nto Washington on business concerning it. Of course he was a statesman,\r\nand it was quite right that the government and the country should have\r\nthe benefit of his best thoughts. But what if this bill and other bills\r\nshould always fill his mind, and leave no room there for--for the poor\r\nlittle affairs of his friends? \"What would father do then?\"\r\n\r\nThe oars rested motionless in the row-locks. Her eyes were dry, but\r\nthere was a breathless stricture on her breast, as though an iron hand\r\nhad clenched her and for the moment crushed the life back.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMr. Neckart, standing back in the shadow of the scrubby althea-bushes,\r\nhis hands clasped behind him and his eyes following the skiff as it\r\ndrifted down the river in the twilight, compelled himself to argue the\r\nmatter out according to the rulings of common sense, just as he would\r\nthe appropriation bill.\r\n\r\nHe had been coming too close of late to this little girl in a brotherly\r\nway--of course in a brotherly way. He must stand farther off. She must\r\nmarry. He had always looked forward to her marrying, and the time, in\r\nall probability, had come now. Van Ness was a manly, strong fellow: her\r\nfather would urge it, and Jane would soon be won. For Neckart, with the\r\nmajority of men, regarded amiability and high-colored, beefy good looks\r\nin his own sex as the irresistible attractions in a woman's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"They both have youth and personal attractions and culture--everything\r\nto make a marriage suitable. I can find no objection to it,\" proceeded\r\nhis most reasonable meditation.\r\n\r\n\"But I can never see it!\"\r\n\r\nHe had not spoken, but it seemed to him as if he had cried out. Then he\r\nlaughed to think what an egregious ass he was. What was this\r\nyellow-haired girl in the boat to him more than any other of the\r\nmillions of women with whom the world was filled? Nothing. They all were\r\nnothing to him.\r\n\r\nHe turned his back on the river and struck into one of the dusky alleys\r\nof the garden, pacing up and down below the old plum trees. He whistled\r\nto himself, and ran his hand through his shaggy hair as if to be rid of\r\nsome cobwebs in his brain. As he brushed against the branches a bird\r\nfluttered out of its nest and chirped angrily. Why, women and their love\r\nand their homes could no more come into his life than that silly robin\r\nor her brood! Two years ago this inexorable necessity did not even give\r\nhim a moment's chagrin. The newspaper, his army of followers, the policy\r\nof the country,--these made life big and full enough. If he wanted\r\nlittle selfish pleasures, there was his arm-chair and open fire, his\r\nshelf of old books, or a dinner at Delmonico's with some clever fellow,\r\nor a dash to Europe, or across the continent, to pry into the background\r\nagainst which other clever fellows, whether white or yellow or black,\r\nlived and worked. He would go back to the office to-night; he could hear\r\nthe engine puffing at the station now, making ready for the next train;\r\nhe could finish the evening with his old friends, the books; he could\r\norder a dinner to-morrow that would satisfy even his palate,--and he\r\nused to be an epicure. He ought to go. He would go.\r\n\r\nHe walked up the open path leading to the house. Then he stopped, turned\r\nand struck directly through the trees and bushes to the river-side. The\r\nboat was at some distance: he called once or twice for her to come and\r\ntake him on board before she heard him. His voice sounded hoarse and\r\nstrange to himself: he did not know himself in what he did. As for the\r\nworld, there was nothing in it but that boat yonder which shot through\r\nthe water, and the woman with eager face rowing swiftly toward him.\r\n\r\nThere was not a Wall-street banker or a politician among Neckart's\r\nconfrères who would not have looked upon him as insane for the moment.\r\nThis dull wisp of a woman to blot out all business, power, place, from\r\nhis life? But, after all, there is no insanity so practical or\r\nlong-lived. Why does A bull and bear the market, or B sell himself and\r\nhis party, but for the sake of some ugly, faded woman and the\r\ncommonplace children she has borne him? They are not thought worth\r\nnotice by anybody but himself, but he ignores honesty, death, God\r\nhimself, for them his life long. A plodding, shrewd fellow too, probably\r\nnot a whit heroic.\r\n\r\nNeckart was tramping along the common road which all of us know, but it\r\nseemed to him that he was breaking ground in a new world full of misty\r\nsplendors and untried action. When he called to her his breath failed\r\nhim, as it used to do when he was a boy wild with excitement. The sand\r\nunder his feet, the brambles on the bank, the overarching sky, were not\r\nthe same they were an hour ago. When the boat darted up to the shore,\r\nrocking as she held it fast with the oar, it seemed strange to him that\r\nshe should speak in her ordinary tone. Did she not know?\r\n\r\nShe stood up in the bow steadying the skiff as he sprang into it. His\r\nhand touched her fingers for an instant, and she noticed that it shrank\r\nfrom hers.\r\n\r\n\"Did my father call me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: I wanted to talk to you alone.\"\r\n\r\nShe pushed from shore and dipped her oars: in a moment they were out in\r\nthe current. It was a rippling belt of steely blue, the banks making\r\nindistinguishable ramparts of shadow on either side. Overhead was the\r\nsoft starless twilight of June, through which a nighthawk flapped\r\nheavily and vanished. When it was gone they were alone. Could she not\r\nunderstand that they were alone? In this wide dark world that there were\r\nonly they two, a man and a woman?\r\n\r\nHe could not distinguish her face, and her figure was but a light dark\r\noutline like a silhouette against the air. But the power of her\r\nwomanhood was upon him, a something which Neckart had never felt\r\nbefore--a terrible, pure passion.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the oars,\" he said. \"Let me help you,\" reaching forward to\r\ntake them. His hand rested on hers accidentally: he did not remove it.\r\n_Now_ did she understand? His mouth was closed. It seemed to him as if\r\nwords were poor to say what was in his blood, in his soul, in the water,\r\nthe air, the very ground.\r\n\r\nShe was startled, and turned to him wondering. The moon, rising higher,\r\nshowed him the childish, sensitive mouth, the dark eyes heavy with\r\ntears, for she had been crying. What was that which gleamed through\r\nthem, half answering him, frightened at itself? It seemed to him in this\r\nbrief pause that they had been waiting all their lives for this word--he\r\nto speak and she to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Jane!\" He took her hand in both of his and held it close, and then he\r\nthrew it from him, drawing back: \"My God! I had forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgotten?\" She closed her eyes once or twice, bewildered, as if\r\nsuddenly wakened from sleep. \"You are in trouble,\" she said anxiously.\r\n\"Can I help you?\"\r\n\r\nThe question brought him to sober reason sharply enough. It was\r\nprecisely the frank, tender tone which she would use to her father; and\r\nthe truth was, that the girl to herself did not yet distinguish between\r\nher father and this friend. A moment before a strange emotion had\r\ntouched her. But it had passed like a warm gust of summer. There was not\r\na seven-year old child in the city yonder who did not know more about\r\nlove than Jane. She had never heard servants or schoolmates chatter\r\nabout it; novels had bored her; the captain, whatever he had left\r\nundone, had kept the air pure and cold about her as for a very nun.\r\n\r\n\"What is this trouble, Mr. Neckart? You have been ill for months, I\r\nknow. Can I--? Or perhaps father--\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward, the oars suspended in her hands, her lips apart,\r\nattentive and eager.\r\n\r\nHe leaned over the edge of the skiff and wet his forehead and eyes,\r\nforcing a careless laugh: \"One moment, Miss Swendon, and I will explain\r\nto you,\" adding presently, precisely in the manner with which he would\r\nhave discussed the weather, \"We men each have our skeleton to hide,\r\naccording to popular belief, and mine is no worse than the rest. It is\r\nthe most practical of facts. Only I am apt to forget it, and then, when\r\nit meets me unawares, it is as grim as death.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, watching him intently as if he were physically ill: she\r\nwould not let the oars strike on the water, lest the noise might jar on\r\nhim. All kinds of wild plans for helping him filled her brain. If the\r\ntrouble were anything which money could help, there was plenty of that,\r\nthank God! If it was political difficulty--bills maybe--she could not\r\neven understand it. If God had only not made her so stupid! the humble\r\ntears rising slowly to her eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Neckart did not see them. He was careful not to look at her as he\r\nspoke, and hurried on with his explanation, as if it were business of\r\nsmall importance. But she was not deceived by that. \"I never have talked\r\nof this matter, and least of all should I have told it to you. I can\r\nbear the trouble when it comes without difficulty. The most ordinary men\r\nmeet disaster coolly which they know is inevitable. Commonplace fellows\r\nwho are born with scrofula or consumption march along with them to early\r\ndeath cheerfully. They make no tragedy out of it. There is no reason why\r\nI should complain of my lifelong companion.\" His tone was harder than he\r\nhad ever used in speaking to Jane before.\r\n\r\n\"I have never told you of my mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" eagerly, hastening to spare him pain. \"But I have heard of her\r\nfrom Cornelia Fleming, who was your neighbor in Delaware. I know all\r\nthat she suffered. You need not tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was the last of the Davidge family. There was not one of them for\r\ngenerations who had not inherited disease of the brain. They were either\r\nepileptics from youth, or became, as she did, incurably insane. The\r\ndisease invariably manifested itself in that way after middle age, and\r\nfrom that time they were helpless burdens to their children. Yet there\r\nwas not a Davidge who refrained from marriage, so entailing the curse\r\non another generation. It would have been more righteous to have put a\r\npistol to their heads and have blown out their brains.\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was quiet and cold. Jane made no answer.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, I have studied the pathology of insanity closely. I know\r\nthat I have inherited the disease. The symptoms within the last six\r\nmonths are unmistakable. I know that in five or ten years at the outside\r\nI shall be of no more use in the world than any other mindless animal.\r\nBut I will have no woman, nor child, suffer for me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he ceased to speak the silence and the night fell oppressively on\r\nthem. The boat had drifted down to the edge of the bank and grounded.\r\nThe moonlight showed her to him sitting in the bow of the boat facing\r\nhim, her hands clasped on her knees. She was so near that if he but\r\nopened his arms he could take her to his breast. Yet he knew that she\r\nwas separated from him now as though death itself lay between.\r\n\r\n\"I have known this necessity which lay upon me for years, Miss Swendon,\"\r\nhe said quietly, but leaning forward to watch her immovable face. \"It is\r\nmy duty to isolate myself as other men need not do. The more dear\"--his\r\nvoice failed suddenly, but he recovered himself in a moment and went\r\non--\"the more dear a woman is to me, the more I must shut her out of my\r\nsight. I can never try to win her nor marry her.\"\r\n\r\nWas the girl stone? Had she not even common human sympathy for him?\r\n\r\n\"You understand why I do this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think I am right?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him with her usual blunt directness: \"You are\r\naltogether right. An honest man could not do otherwise.\" Her chin fell\r\non her breast again. Not a moan, not a breath of regret, at the blow\r\nwhich struck them apart. Weaker women would have cried a little at\r\nparting from a dog who had been sometimes a companion. This cool-blooded\r\nSwede gave her verdict on the right and wrong of the matter as though\r\nit had been a sale of goods, and there was the end of it! All the\r\nlong-latent passion in Neckart's nature revolted and flamed into life.\r\nHe moved restlessly, watching her sit there stony and immovable. He\r\nwould have flung away life, as men used to do against the dumb Sphinx,\r\nto tear from her some word of pity or life.\r\n\r\nThe boat rocked in the shallow water. She rose to leave it. Neckart\r\nmechanically held out his hand to help her jump ashore. She held it\r\ntightly, and when she stood beside him on the grass took it in both her\r\nown: \"No. You ought never to marry. You ought to hold yourself apart\r\nfrom the world. These strange people would only irritate and wear you\r\nout. Now you can give yourself entirely to us. We are your nearest\r\nfriends. You shall give up the paper and politics: it is the work and\r\nanxiety that are telling on your brain. You shall live here with father,\r\nin the quiet and country air. I will take care of you both.\" She stroked\r\nhis hand as a mother might that of her dying child, trying to believe\r\nthat it was not growing cold. For a year the girl had fought death back\r\nfrom her father step by step. Now, her one friend, who with the old man\r\nfilled all the world for her, was to be taken from her.\r\n\r\nHe seated her on a fallen log and pushed back the hair from her clammy\r\nforehead: \"Child! child! you do not understand! All I have told you has\r\ngone for nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do understand. I can cure you both. Rest and the air--I am dull, but\r\nyou don't know how good a nurse I can be for my own people,\" with a\r\npitiful laugh.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak. The soft golden hair lay in his hand, warm and alive.\r\nHe looked down at her. He could soon turn this childish affection into\r\nlove: he could wrench her soul into his own. Why should he not take what\r\nGod had set before him? All the other men of his race had done it.\r\n\r\nOne moment he stood irresolute. Then the hair dropped from his hand.\r\n\"Jane,\" he said, as if reasoning with a child, \"when I remember my\r\nmother first she was a pretty, tender little woman, with hardly a\r\nthought outside of her boy. For years before she died I was forced to\r\nfasten her as one does a wild beast, that she might not kill me. Do you\r\nunderstand what that was to me? Do you think I can bring the misery I\r\nknew in those years to any woman? My wife shall never have it to bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can have no wife!\" she cried. \"You said you dared not marry!\r\n_I_ can bear the misery. You will come to us--us. Those women in\r\nWashington of whom you tell me--how could they know what you need? I\r\nhave nobody but you and father.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt herself so young and strong! Death, a most horrible and certain\r\ndeath, was creeping upon him. In her agony of pity she held his hand to\r\nher wet, burning cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Jane, you drive me mad!\" stooping over her trembling. \"It is you--you\r\nthat I dare not marry!\"\r\n\r\nShe stood erect: \"_I_ marry you? I never thought of that,\" simply.\r\n\r\n\"You never thought of it?\" with a queer uncertain laugh. \"You never\r\nthought that I loved you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you loved me, Mr. Neckart? Me?\" The blue innocent eyes that had\r\nbeen fixed on his suddenly filled with light; she dropped her face into\r\nher hands; her whole body burned with blushes, and she turned away.\r\n\r\nNeckart slowly followed her. Jane's thoughts were always transparent as\r\ncrystal: he had read in that one brief glance all the delight, the\r\ntender passion, whose first impulse was to escape from him.\r\n\r\n\"I have been a damned scoundrel!\" he said to himself: \"I have ruined her\r\nlife!\"\r\n\r\nHe was now thoroughly awake to what he had done--saw it as any other\r\npractical, honorable man would do, unbiased by his passion or his pity\r\nfor himself. He walked silently beside her as she went up the steep path\r\nto the house.\r\n\r\nAs for Jane, she did not know that he was silent: she would scarcely\r\nhave heard if he had spoken to her. She did not know what this was that\r\nhad come to her, that had lifted her whole life upward as by a touch.\r\nShe could not look at him. If she could only reach her father and hide\r\nfrom him, that he might never find her--never! She remembered how a\r\nminute ago she had held his hand to her face, and the hot flood of shame\r\ncovered every other thought: the next she glanced shyly at him with a\r\nsweet pride;--he loved her, he would understand! The terrible story he\r\nhad told her had passed out of her mind like a breath of smoke in\r\nsunshine. He loved her: she could keep him out of all danger. Even if\r\nshe had remembered that she could never be his wife, it would not have\r\ntroubled her. He loved her! She thought no more of marriage than the\r\nbird in its first song of dawn thinks of the barred lines and visible\r\nnotes to which its music might somewhere be written down.\r\n\r\nNeckart followed her up the steps and into the wide hall, carrying his\r\nhat behind him in his hand. The damp air wet his hair, and it hung\r\nlankly back from his haggard face. He felt physically ill. He had acted\r\nlike a brute, a coward! This was the end of his stern resolve, his\r\nlifelong self-denial!\r\n\r\nA lamp burned at the foot of the wide staircase. He paused beside it:\r\nshe had gone up a step or two, and halted, her hand on the rail, looking\r\ndown. \"Good-night!\" she said shyly.\r\n\r\nThe light shone full on the pink glow in her cheeks, the loose hair\r\nglistening like a golden mist, the half-frightened, half-triumphant\r\ngleam shot down from the blue eyes.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer her.\r\n\r\nThe delicate virgin bloom of this love which he had coveted so madly an\r\nhour ago scarcely stirred his heart now with pleasure. A man cannot live\r\nall the time on the heights of emotion or of religion; the air is too\r\nrarefied up there for healthy lungs; he comes down punctually to the\r\nordinary levels of his saner self; and Neckart, on his ordinary level,\r\nwas an exceedingly practical, honest man. He knew that he had brought\r\nirreparable injury to this girl, and that it was his duty now to make\r\namends as best he could.\r\n\r\n                                          REBECCA HARDING DAVIS.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WISH.\r\n\r\n\r\n     When thou, O Death! shalt wait\r\n     Without my gate--\r\n     Call not the porter out\r\n     With knock and shout:\r\n     But still unnoticed bide\r\n     The gate beside,\r\n     Till Sleep, my oft-time guest,\r\n     Doth come in quest\r\n     Of me.

ELIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME PATTERSON-BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach year adds fresh interest to this remarkable woman, whose story has\r\nbeen rehearsed in every land, whose personal traits still afford food\r\nfor social chronicle. Lady Morgan said, \"She belongs to history; she\r\nlived with kings and princes, philosophers and artists; there is about\r\nher a perpetual curiosity and romance.\" Speeding on to a rounded century\r\nof life, she is still moved to eloquent agitation in reciting her\r\nwrongs, not merely those sustained at the hands of the Bonapartes, but\r\nthose inflicted by her father. William Patterson, son of a farmer in\r\nDonegal county, Ireland, was at fourteen years of age sent to\r\nPhiladelphia and placed in the counting-house of Samuel Jackson, a\r\nshipping merchant. In 1775 young Patterson embarked his property in\r\nvessels trading to France with returning cargoes of powder and arms, for\r\nneed of which the colonies were crippled. The supply arrived at a\r\ncritical time, Washington, then before Boston, not having powder\r\nwherewithal to fire a salute. Mr. Patterson stopped at the West Indies,\r\nwhere he soon made eighty thousand dollars, coming thence to Baltimore,\r\nwhere he soon acquired a million of dollars and high social position.\r\nThese facts are minutely set forth in his will, a remarkable document in\r\nits complacent personal details. Cataloguing his own virtues, he says:\r\n\"I have made the fortunes of some, saved others from ruin, and found\r\nbread and employment for thousands of my fellow-mortals; and no one\r\ncould ever say to me, 'Neighbor and friend, you got the advantage of me,\r\nyou acted ungenerously to me.' The conduct of my daughter Betsey has\r\nthrough life been so disobedient that in no instance has she ever\r\nconsulted my opinion and feelings: her folly and misconduct have first\r\nto last cost me much money;\" but yielding to the dictates of his large\r\nheart he bequeaths her from his great wealth a few paltry houses and his\r\ncellar of wine! _De mortuis nil nisi bonum_--a humane maxim; but when a\r\nman deposits in the public archives his autobiography, we are incited to\r\ninquire of what worth may be his self-laudation, and what the animus\r\nthat winged from the grave so cruel a shaft at his child's good name.\r\nThat he was of strict integrity in business relations, a citizen of no\r\nmean \"credit and renown\" is true, but beneath this respectable cloak we\r\nfind on contemporary authority a man close and arbitrary in his family\r\nand by no means impeccable in morality. One incident lets in light on\r\nhis amiable domestic relations. His wife having long expressed a wish\r\nfor a carriage, he at length imported an English chariot, but no horses\r\nwere forthcoming, and in answer to her remonstrances he said, \"I never\r\npromised you any horses;\" so the chariot remained in the coach-house for\r\nthe rest of his life.\r\n\r\nMrs. Patterson came of that sturdy, independent Scotch-Irish race that\r\nhas peopled Pennsylvania's prosperous valleys. Her grandmother, Mrs.\r\nGalbraith, was of remarkable force of character, taking a prominent part\r\nin Revolutionary stir, and on one occasion traversing on horseback the\r\nthen almost wilderness to canvass votes for her husband's election to\r\nthe Assembly, which she won--whether by robust argument or in the\r\nfelicitous way of the beautiful duchess of Devonshire is not recorded.\r\nTo Mrs. Patterson--tender, religious and well cultured--her daughter\r\nowes her familiarity with English and French classics, becoming versed\r\nin the literature of Queen Anne's Augustan age, and able when ten years\r\nold to recite from memory a large portion of that tough morsel, Young's\r\n_Night Thoughts_, a page of which she recently repeated to a friend with\r\nthe remark that she \"had not seen the poem for seventy-five years.\" She\r\nlearned Rochefoucauld's _Maxims_ by heart--an unfortunate guide, to whom\r\ndoubtless she partly owes her cynical appreciation of human motives.\r\nShe possessed a quick, logical mind and prodigious memory, while passing\r\nyears developed sparkling wit, fascinating manners and woman's crown of\r\nbeauty. This gifted child was repressed by her father with strange\r\nbitterness, as if unnaturally jealous of her talent. In what consisted\r\nher \"folly, misconduct and disobedience\"? The wayward self-will of a\r\nmere girl could hardly merit such stern reprisal. She had barely reached\r\nwomanhood when she made the marriage on which his heart was set, which\r\nhe instigated and urged forward, allured by the alliance of his name\r\nwith that already reechoing through the world, although fully warned of\r\nthe risk of his daughter being scorned by Napoleon. Previous to her\r\nmarriage she said to her father, \"Suppose the First Consul should refuse\r\nto receive me?\"--\"Do not fear,\" he replied: \"you shall come back to me\r\nan honored daughter.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Martinique, Jerome Bonaparte said to a former resident of\r\nBaltimore, \"Ah! il me faut une mariage de convenance.\" \"Not so,\"\r\nrejoined the lady; \"and I know the most beautiful woman in the world,\r\nwhom you must marry--Miss Elizabeth Patterson of Baltimore.\" And so he\r\nfirst heard her name. Soon after Jerome's arrival in Baltimore one of\r\nhis suite, M. Rubelle--his father a member of the famous French\r\nDirectory--married a young lady of that city, to whom Jerome said,\r\n\"Jamais je n'épouserai une demoiselle Américaine.\"--\"Ne soyez pas si\r\nsûr,\" replied she: \"Mademoiselle Patterson est si belle que la voir\r\nc'est l'épouser.\" Mrs. Patterson, with a maternal prevision of\r\nmisfortune, wishing to prevent their meeting, carried her daughter to\r\nher country place, where they remained until November. This enforced\r\nexclusion from the festivities consequent on Jerome's arrival naturally\r\nexcited the young girl, who was found by her brother in tears. \"What\r\nails you, Betsey?\" Having sobbingly disclosed her woes, she was allowed\r\nto return to town. Meanwhile Jerome was saying, \"Ma belle femme,\r\npourquoi ne revient-elle de la campagne.\" One morning, as Mme. Rubelle\r\nentered her carriage, in which Miss Patterson awaited her as chaperon to\r\nthe races, Jerome appeared, was presented and accompanied them, to the\r\nannoyance of the fair Betsey, who, irate at his rumored impertinence in\r\ncalling her his _belle femme_, turned from him with indifference and\r\neven _brusquerie_, which, if coquetry, could not have been better\r\ndesigned: from that moment he was captive. On this momentous occasion\r\nshe was attired in buff-colored silk, very scant as to drapery, a lace\r\nfichu and a huge Leghorn bonnet trimmed with pink gauze and long ostrich\r\nfeathers. The wooing was ardent, but growing at one moment lukewarm, Mr.\r\nPatterson, wise in his generation, sent Miss Betsey to Virginia; which\r\nruse had the desired effect, piquing the lover into an immediate\r\ndeclaration on her return. Mrs. Patterson yielded a reluctant consent.\r\n\"Your father,\" she said, \"would probably force you into something\r\ndetestable for money, so this may be for you a happy escape.\" The\r\nmarriage, the preliminaries of which are historically familiar, was\r\ncelebrated in her father's house on Christmas Eve, 1803, in the presence\r\nof ecclesiastical, national and State dignitaries. There were only two\r\nbridesmaids, the Misses Brown, great folk of that day, and no groomsman.\r\n\r\nJerome had imported for her a superb trousseau, but her bridal attire\r\nwas a simple India muslin, costly with old lace, a row of pearls\r\nencircling her lovely throat--\"a gown I had frequently worn,\" she said\r\nin describing the event to the writer, \"for I particularly wished to\r\navoid vulgar display; and, truth to say, there was as little as possible\r\nof any gown at all, dress in that day being chiefly an aid in setting\r\noff beauty to advantage.\" These bridal garments are still preserved, as\r\nwell as Jerome's wedding-suit of laced and embroidered purple satin--the\r\nwhite satin-lined pointed skirts reaching to his heels--knee-breeches\r\nand diamond buckles, the powdered hair enhancing his Napoleonic beauty.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, Aaron Burr wrote from Washington to his daughter: \"Jerome\r\nBonaparte and his bride are here. She is a charming little woman--just\r\nthe figure and nearly the size of Theodosia Burr Alston, by some thought\r\na little like her; perhaps not so well in the shoulders; dresses with\r\ntaste and simplicity (by some thought too free); has sense, spirit and\r\nsprightliness.\" Jerome now began to quake at Napoleon's fulminations\r\nagainst his marriage, and but for his spirited wife would have longer\r\ndelayed confronting the imperial wrath. In 1805 they set sail from\r\nPhiladelphia, but before reaching the Capes a terrific gale drove them\r\non a sandbank, each moment threatening destruction. Mme. Bonaparte's\r\ncourage saved their lives. Clambering to the deck, she insisted that the\r\nsailors should man a boat. \"Pray, are you commanding this vessel?\" asked\r\nthe captain.--\"Yes, if necessary.\"--\"How do you propose reaching that\r\nboat?\" he queried when at length it was launched.--\"You are to throw me\r\nin.\" He obeyed, but in attempting to lower her from the ship, now nearly\r\non its side, his strength failed and she fell into the waves. Her wadded\r\nsilk pelisse carried her down, but as she rose the sailors grasped and\r\nhauled her into the boat. \"Where is Prince Jerome?\" was her first\r\nquestion in that perilous moment. They reached land through a dangerous\r\nsurf, and forgot their drenching in the hospitality of a farm-house.\r\n\"You irreligious little wretch!\" said her aunt: \"instead of kneeling in\r\nthanksgiving for your deliverance, you are enjoying roast goose and\r\napple sauce!\"\r\n\r\nNot disheartened by this ominous venture, in a few weeks they again\r\nembarked for Lisbon, where, after Jerome's desertion, his wife remained\r\nfor seven days, and then sailed for Amsterdam. As the Erin lay in Texel\r\nRoads, the captain of a French frigate came daily to present \"ses\r\nhommages à Mademoiselle Patterson,\" and to ascertain her orders for the\r\nday. \"Prisoners, sir, have no orders to give,\" was her reply. Perceiving\r\nthe futility of opposing the emperor's decrees, and justly apprehensive\r\nof personal peril should she force a landing on the Continent, she\r\nsailed for Dover, but here again she was immeshed in Bonaparte\r\nrestrictions, as no member of that family could enter England without\r\npermission of the government. Mr. Pitt, then prime minister, sent a\r\nmilitary escort, which lined the way, keeping off the crowd that strove\r\nto get a glimpse of her as she disembarked and entered her carriage. At\r\nCamberwell, her son, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, was born, eighteen\r\nmonths after her marriage. Two months later she sailed for the United\r\nStates. Her father in the marriage contract had guaranteed to her\r\ncertain property and one thousand dollars per annum, but on her return\r\nhe declined to redeem his promise, on the plea that her rejection by the\r\nFirst Consul, by invalidating the marriage, had nullified his agreement\r\nwith his child, whose misfortune he resented as a crime. Prince Jerome\r\nat the birth of their son sent her a thousand guineas, and with this\r\npaltry sum she began life anew.\r\n\r\nNeither poverty nor the humiliating overthrow of her happiness daunted\r\nthis young creature's spirit, which rose always to the occasion. When\r\nKing Jerome, after his marriage with the princess of Würtemberg, offered\r\nhis repudiated wife the principality of Smalcand with forty thousand\r\ndollars per annum, her witty reply, that \"Westphalia no doubt was a\r\nconsiderable kingdom, but not large enough to hold two queens,\" so\r\npleased the emperor that he directed the French minister at Washington,\r\nM. Serrurier, to intimate his wish to serve her. \"Tell the emperor that\r\nI am ambitious: I wish to be made a duchess of France.\" This the emperor\r\npromised to do at a later moment, and offered her twenty thousand\r\ndollars down and a life annuity of twelve thousand dollars, which she\r\naccepted, \"proud to be indebted to the greatest man of modern times,\"\r\nbut with the proviso that the receipt for payment should be signed by\r\nher as _Elizabeth Bonaparte_, which would be a virtual acknowledgment of\r\nthe legality of her marriage and her claims on the head of the family.\r\nTo this stipulation the emperor acceded, and until his abdication the\r\nannuity was regularly paid. Jerome was stung to a protest against her\r\nacceptance of aid from his brother while rejecting his own, to which she\r\nretorted that she \"preferred shelter beneath the wing of the eagle to\r\nsuspension from the pinion of the goose.\"\r\n\r\nMme. Bonaparte now applied to the Maryland Legislature for a divorce,\r\nwhich was at once granted. This action on her part was natural, but as a\r\nmatter of policy questionable. His wife by every law human and divine,\r\nshe could better have guarded her son's interests, and even maintained\r\nher own rightful position, by ignoring Jerome's alliance with the\r\nprincess, which was regarded by Catholic Christendom as illegal, the\r\npope stoutly refusing to nullify the previous marriage.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonaparte always expresses enthusiasm for the emperor, despite the\r\ndespotism that shivered the fair fabric of her life, seeking its excuse\r\nin the exigencies of his anomalous position. During her residence in\r\nParis after the Restoration, Louis Dix-Huit--_Des Huitres_, the wits\r\nstyled him from his inordinate love of oysters--fancying that her\r\npresence would reflect contemptuously on the late \"Corsican usurper,\"\r\nmade known his wish to see her at court. This honor she declined, \"not\r\nwishing to pose as a victim of imperial tyranny: she had accepted the\r\nemperor's kindness, and ingratitude was not one of her vices.\" Marshal\r\nBertrand--\"faithful among the faithless\" Napoleon called him--who heard\r\nthe last sigh of the great heart at St. Helena, visited this country\r\nthirty years ago and requested an interview with Mme. Bonaparte. \"The\r\nemperor,\" he said, \"had spoken of her talent with admiration tinged with\r\nregret for the shadow he had cast over her life, for he had heard of her\r\ngenerous sentiments toward him, alluding to which he one day said,\r\n'Those whom I so wronged have forgiven me: those I overwhelmed with my\r\nbounty have forsaken me.'\"\r\n\r\nMme. Bonaparte bore no malice to Jerome, whose nature was not of heroic\r\nmould; and yet what touching professions of fidelity he sent\r\nher!--letters unsurpassed in manly tenderness. A few months after their\r\nseparation a gentleman writes of him: \"He is always saying, 'My wife!\r\nmy dear little wife!' He seems much affected, and declares that he\r\n'shall for ever remember the shipwreck they had encountered: how well on\r\nthat trying occasion did she behave! how, when danger was over, he\r\npressed her in his arms!'\" \"Jerome loved me to the last,\" says Mme.\r\nBonaparte: \"he thought me the handsomest woman in the world, and the\r\nmost charming. After his marriage to the princess he gave to the\r\ncourt-painter several miniatures of me from which to make a portrait,\r\nwhich he kept hidden from the good Catherine.\"\r\n\r\nWith the return of the Bourbons, Mme. Bonaparte was free to tread the\r\nsoil of France, and among the throngs of lovely women who entered Paris\r\nafter Waterloo she was no inconspicuous figure. Portraits and\r\ncontemporaries represent her as uncommonly beautiful--the spirited head\r\ncrowned with waving brown hair; large, lustrous, liquid hazel eyes,\r\npromising a tender sensibility that did not exist; a nose of delicate\r\nGreek outline; mouth and rounded chin nests for Cupid; arms, bust and\r\nshoulders to satisfy a sculptor. Surgeon-General Larrey, the medical\r\nattendant at St. Helena, meeting Mme. Bonaparte at dinner in Paris,\r\nrequested their host, Count Rochefoucauld, to intercede with her for the\r\nprivilege of looking at the back of her neck. After studying her a\r\nmoment, he said, \"It is extraordinary! The bend of the neck, the contour\r\nof face, the pose of the head, even the manner of rising from her chair,\r\nare singular in their resemblance to the emperor.\" The duchess\r\nD'Abrantes (Mme. Junot) describes in her _Memoirs_ a meeting with\r\nJerome, \"who showed us a fine miniature of his wife, the features\r\nexquisitely beautiful, with a resemblance to those of the princess\r\nBorghese, which Jerome said he and many Frenchmen in Baltimore had\r\nremarked. 'Judge,' he said, replacing the portrait in his bosom, 'if I\r\ncan abandon a being like her! I only wish the emperor would consent to\r\nsee her, to hear her voice, but for a single moment. For myself, I am\r\nresolved not to yield.'\" Walpole's friend, Miss Berry, met Mme.\r\nBonaparte in the _salon_ of Mme. Récamier, \"who sat on a _chaise longue_\r\nwith a headache and twelve or fifteen men, only two ladies being\r\npresent--Mme. Moreau and Mrs. Patterson, the ex-wife of Jerome\r\nBonaparte, who is exceedingly pretty, without grace and not at all\r\nshy.... Mme. Récamier is _the_ beauty of this _new_ world, if she can be\r\ncalled handsome: her manners are _doucereuses_, thinking much of\r\nherself, with perfect carelessness about others, for, besides being a\r\nbeauty, she has pretensions to _bel esprit_: they may be as well founded\r\nas the other, yet not sufficient to burn her for a witch.\" Now, Miss\r\nBerry--called the black-Berry, in contradistinction to her duller\r\nsister, the goose-Berry--was jaundiced in her estimation of both\r\nbeauties, and Mme. Bonaparte bears tribute to \"that rare loveliness of\r\ntemper and tact in displaying the good qualities even of rivals that\r\nwere potent weapons in Récamier's quiver of charms.\" Miss Berry's dictum\r\nis also outweighed by the homage of Mme. de Staël's envying sigh, that\r\nshe \"would willingly exchange her genius for Récamier's beauty.\" Mme.\r\nRécamier was anxious that Mme. Bonaparte should know \"Corinne.\" \"No,\r\nno,\" she replied: \"De Staël est une colosse qui m'écraserait; elle me\r\ntrouverait une jolie bête et je ne veux pas être tuée à Paris par ce\r\nmot-là.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke of Wellington succeeded Napoleon in his residence at the\r\nElysée-Bourbon, since then fitted up as the dower-palace of Eugénie, and\r\nnow the head-quarters of President MacMahon. Gay, fickle Paris,\r\noblivious of disaster, was shouting hosannas to the victor of its\r\nerewhile idol, and in this carnival of _fêtes_ those of the duke were\r\nsurpassingly magnificent. Mme. Bonaparte describes Wellington as \"short,\r\nerect, spare of figure, with long pale face, thin-lipped, obstinate\r\nmouth, small light eyes, high, sharp, angular nose, the head\r\ndisproportionately large, and as squarely flat as an Indian's, reverence\r\nand benevolence being undeveloped. Coldly quiet in voice and greeting,\r\nsimple and high-bred in manner, there was in this reticence a suggestion\r\nof reserved force exceedingly attractive.\" At one of these balls Mme.\r\nBonaparte was seated in conversation with the handsome and fascinating\r\nLord Castlereagh, when Mme. de Staël approached, and stopping in front\r\nof her gazed steadily for a moment, then turning to her son, Baron de\r\nStaël-Holstein, on whose arm she leaned, an intimate friend of Mme.\r\nBonaparte, she said, \"Oui, elle est bien, bien jolie,\" and walked off\r\nwithout another word. Near by sat Lady Morgan, whose success, literary\r\nand social, was phenomenal. As Sidney Owenson, soon after her _Wild\r\nIrish Girl_ made her famous, she sat awestruck opposite to Dr. Johnson\r\nat a large London dinner, when suddenly, to the terror of the child,\r\nuntamed as her own heroine, burly Samuel called across in severe tones,\r\n\"Little girl! little girl! where did you get so many hard\r\nwords?\"--\"Please, sir, in your dictionary,\" was the naïve reply that\r\ndisarmed the lexicographer. In Lady Morgan's _Memoirs_ we read: \"Mme.\r\nBonaparte, wife of Jerome, who had abandoned her in a cruel and\r\ndastardly way, was not of the _pâte_ out of which victims and martyrs\r\nare made. She held her difficult position with a scornful courage that\r\nexcites pity for the woman's nature so scathed and outraged. Her letters\r\nbear the impress of a life run to waste: they are clever, mordant and\r\namusing, but the bitter sense of wrong cannot be concealed: there is a\r\ndissatisfaction--one might almost call it jealousy--in the topics\r\ndiscussed.\" Mme. Bonaparte keeps her friend _au courant_ with Paris\r\ngossip, but we have only space to glance at the revelation of her weary,\r\nempty heart: \"PARIS, November, 1816. DEAR LADY MORGAN: I have executed\r\nall your commissions except that _auprès de_ Mme. de Genlis. I have been\r\nso unwell it has been impossible for me to visit the penitent at the\r\nCarmelites. I meet the princess de Beauveau every week at Mme.\r\nRumford's, where there is an assemblage of _gens d'esprit_--not that I\r\ncall myself one of them. However, people say that I am very good, which\r\nis my passport to these _réunions_. I have been asking after the _Novice\r\nof St. Dominic_, which has not yet been seen by any of your friends.\"\r\n[William Pitt read this novel for the fifth time a few days before his\r\ndeath.] \"I have been very triste: tout m'ennuie dans ce mondeci, et je\r\nne sçais pas pourquoi, unless it be the recollection of what I have\r\nsuffered. I think the best thing for me is to return to my dear child. I\r\nlove him so entirely that seeing him may render my feelings less\r\npoignant. Any inconveniences are more supportable than being separated\r\nfrom one's children. How much more we love them than our husbands! the\r\nlatter are often so selfish and cruel; but children cannot force mothers\r\nfrom their affection.\"... \"PARIS, 1817 Your kind letter by Tom Moore\r\nreached me. He seldom sees me: I did not take with him at all.... How\r\nhappy you must be at filling the world with your name! Mme. de Staël and\r\nMme. de Genlis are forgotten, and if the love of fame be of any weight,\r\nyour excursion to Paris was a brilliant success. Your work on France has\r\nappeared through a French translation, in which they have suppressed\r\nwhat they thought best. Its truths cannot at this moment be admitted\r\nhere, but in all other countries it will have complete success. The\r\nviolent clamor of the Paris gazettes proves it to be too well written.\r\nThey are publishing it in America, where your talents are justly\r\nappreciated.... I have not seen Mme. d'H---- for a long time: she dines\r\nat half-past nine--wakes when other persons sleep, which makes it\r\nimpossible to enjoy her society without paying the price of a night's\r\nrepose.... Your friend and admirer Mr. S---- is dead of old age. I met\r\nhim two weeks previous at a party. His widow gave a dinner the next\r\nweek, because she was afraid of being _triste_--receives and appears on\r\nthe Boulevards, because 'bon ami m'a dit qu'il fallait vivre.' Her\r\nfriends flatter themselves that her sensibility will not kill her, at\r\nthe same time that it enables them to give agreeable parties.... My\r\ndesire to see my child is stronger than my taste for Paris. I am of your\r\nopinion: the best thing a woman can do is to marry: even quarrels with\r\none's husband are preferable to the ennui of a solitary existence.\r\nThere are so many hours apart from those appropriated to the world that\r\none cannot get rid of--at least one like myself, having no useful\r\noccupation. You never felt ennui, because you cultivate talents which\r\nwill immortalize you.... Mme. de Staël died regretting a life that she\r\nhad contrived to render very agreeable. Her most intimate friends were\r\nignorant that a marriage with M. Rocca existed, and unless her will had\r\nsubstantiated the fact they would have treated it as a calumny. Marrying\r\na man twenty years younger than herself, without fortune or name, is in\r\nFrance _un ridicule, pire qu'un crime_. What think you of the\r\n_Manuscript of St. Helena_ being attributed to her and Benjamin\r\nConstant? Is it possible to carry the desire of rendering her\r\ninconsistent further?... Adieu! Your recollection accompanies me to the\r\nNew World, where I hope I may meet any one half so agreeable. They write\r\nme that my son is _pétri d'esprit_. I fear that after exciting my hopes\r\nhe will become, like the generality of people, mediocre and tiresome.\r\nYours affectionately, ELIZA PATTERSON.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter is preceded by Lady Morgan's comment: \"Mme. Bonaparte,\r\nwith her airy manner, beauty and wit, would have made an excellent\r\nprincess, American as she was. One wonders that Napoleon should have\r\nbeen blind to her capabilities--he whose motto was, 'The tools to him\r\nwho can use them.'\"--\"BALTIMORE, 1818. DEAR LADY MORGAN:... The demand\r\nfor your work on France was so great that it went through three editions\r\nwith us.... My son is intelligent, good and very handsome.... You have a\r\ngreat deal of imagination, but it can give you no idea of the mode of\r\nexistence inflicted on us. The men are all merchants, and commerce may\r\nfill the purse, but clogs the brain: beyond their counting-houses they\r\npossess not a single idea; they never visit except when they wish to\r\nmarry. The women are occupied in _les détails du ménage_ and nursing\r\nchildren--useful occupations that do not render them agreeable to their\r\nneighbors. The men, being all bent on marriage, do not attend to me,\r\nbecause they fancy I am not inclined to change the evils of my condition\r\nfor those they could offer me. I have been thought so _ennuyée_ as to\r\naccept very respectable offers, but I prefer remaining as I am to\r\nmarrying a person to whom I am indifferent. My letters from Paris say\r\nthat Decaze, the minister of police, is created a peer and is to marry\r\nPrincess de Beauveau. It appears very strange to my recollections of\r\npolitical feelings, but nothing is too surprising with politicians. He\r\nis very handsome at least--not a bad thing in a husband: they say, too,\r\nthat he has talents and sensibility.... Suppose you were to come to this\r\ncountry: it is becoming the fashion to travel here, and you might find\r\nmaterials for an interesting work.... It is impossible for me to return\r\nto Europe: a single woman is exposed to so many disagreeable comments in\r\na foreign land. Besides, I have only eleven hundred pounds a year--not\r\nenough to support me out of my own family.... I embroider and read. Do\r\nyou remember Mme. de Staël's description of the mode of life Corinne\r\nfound in an English country town, the subjects of conversation limited\r\nto births, deaths and marriages? My opinion on these topics has long\r\nbeen decided: that it is a misery to be born and married I have\r\npainfully experienced.... Have you a good college in Dublin? I might\r\nsend my son there in two years, as he cannot go to France, and I do not\r\nwish him to be educated in England, where his name would not recommend\r\nhim to favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"GENEVA, 1819. DEAR LADY MORGAN:... I should never have ventured on\r\nanother voyage to Europe could I have found the means of education for\r\nmy son.... We have been nearly ruined by commercial speculations, and\r\neven I have suffered.... My son's education, too, demands no\r\ninconsiderable expense, and his father never _has_, and never _will_,\r\ncontribute a single farthing toward his maintenance. We have no\r\ncorrespondence since the demand that he would pay part of his necessary\r\nexpenditure, which he positively refused.... This town is intolerably\r\nexpensive--as much so as Paris: there exists, too, an _esprit de\r\ncoterie_ appalling to _women_ strangers, for men are _les bien venus\r\npartout_. They have a custom _parmi les gens du haut_ of receiving\r\nstrangers to board at a very high price _seulement pour leur agrément_,\r\nin which houses there is no feast to be found unless it be of reason:\r\nthe hosts are too _spirituels_ to fancy that we possess a vulgar\r\nappetite for meat, vegetables, tarts and custards; but as I cannot\r\nsubsist altogether on the contemplation of _la belle Nature_, I have\r\ntaken an apartment, hoping to get something to eat.... My health is\r\nrestored, and I am much less in the _genre larmoyant_ than when you saw\r\nme.... I am happy not to have gone to Edinburgh: the climate here is\r\nfiner, living cheaper and the language French--more desirable for my\r\nson. Why do you persist in living in Ireland?\"\r\n\r\nKing Jerome afterward allowed his son one hundred dollars per month for\r\nseven years, but with malignant cruelty ignored him in his will, which\r\nwrong at once to her son and her own wifely fame Mme. Bonaparte\r\ncontested in Paris with a spirit that elicited the sympathy of Europe;\r\nbut Napoleon III., for reasons of policy, permitted her defeat, and also\r\nat this time discontinued the annuity of fourteen thousand dollars\r\nallowed to her son, Jerome Bonaparte, although recognizing him at court\r\nas his cousin; but the six thousand dollars per annum granted to her\r\ngrandson, Captain Bonaparte, ceased only with the Empire.\r\n\r\n\"GENEVA, 1820. DEAR LADY MORGAN:... Baron Bonstetten came to see me\r\nto-day. You were the subject of our conversation: nothing but\r\nadmiration. M. Sismondi has made my acquaintance--he is married too: I\r\nwonder that people of genius marry. I have been in such a state of\r\nmelancholy as to wish myself dead a thousand times. What think you of a\r\nperson advising me to turn Methodist? Have you read Lamartine's\r\n_Méditations poétiques_? There are some fine things in them, but he is\r\ntoo _larmoyant_ and of the bad school of politics. Miss Edgeworth is\r\nhere: she came to see me, but we have not met. She has a great deal of\r\ngood sense, which I particularly object to in my companions unless\r\naccompanied by genius.... They are so reasonable and unmoved in this\r\nplace, their mornings devoted to the exact sciences, their evenings to\r\nwhist! There have been some English, but I have seen little of them:\r\nthey are cold, formal, affected--just my antipodes; therefore we should\r\nnot please each other: they require a year to become acquainted, and I\r\nhave too little left of life to waste on formalities.... In this\r\nbirthplace of Calvinism I found no trace of its originator, either in\r\nactual relics or asceticism: it was rather the centre of folly and\r\nlicense.\"\r\n\r\nBaron Bonstetten, savant and philanthropist--whom Lady Morgan styles\r\n\"that fresh, frisky old darling\"--showed Mme. Bonaparte paternal\r\nkindness. In a morning visit she found him in his library examining\r\nletters. He said, \"Asseyez vous un peu, mon enfant, en attendant que je\r\nfinisse de ces papiers,\" and she sat for an hour reading letters from\r\ncelebrities which he tossed to her--among others, perhaps inadvertently,\r\nfrom Mme. de Staël, proving the good baron's admiration for Corinne to\r\nhave been \"warmer than friendship if colder than love.\" At a ball at\r\nBonstetten's, as Mme. Bonaparte entered the room, a stout, handsome man\r\ncovered with orders eagerly exclaimed, \"Qui est-ce? qui est-ce?\"--\"La\r\npremière femme de Jérome Bonaparte,\" replied the princess Gallitzin. It\r\nwas Duke William of Würtemberg, uncle of Jerome's second wife. He\r\nrequested a presentation, took both hands affectionately, and after\r\nconversing half an hour led her to his duchess, to whom he said\r\nafterward, \"Mais, mon Dieu! que Jérome a manqué son coup. Quelle grâce,\r\nquelle beauté, quel esprit! Et ma pauvre nièce! il faut être juste;\r\njamais ne pourrait-elle régner comme cette belle Américaine, qui par\r\ntout droit est vraiment la reine. Jérome a été bête de la\r\nquitter.\"--\"Ah,\" said Bonstetten, \"si elle n'est pas reine de\r\nWestphalie, elle est au moins reine des coeurs.\"\r\n\r\nJerome sent for his son, then a lad, to visit him at Rome, where he\r\nremained several months, treated with affection by his father and with\r\nmaternal kindness by the princess, who went two leagues to meet him, and\r\ntaking his face between her hands said tearfully, \"Ah! mon enfant, je\r\nsuis la cause innocente de tous vos malheurs.\" She evinced always the\r\nutmost interest in her predecessor. Mme. Rubelle was appointed lady of\r\nhonor to her when queen of Westphalia, and was meaningly questioned,\r\n\"Are all the American ladies as beautiful as yourself?\" Prince Woronzow\r\nsaid of these rival wives, \"Je suis amoureux des deux reines de\r\nWestphalie.\"\r\n\r\nOn her arrival in France the princess of Würtemberg halted at Raincy to\r\nmeet Prince Jerome, \"who had sworn to me,\" says Mme. Junot, \"never to\r\nforget the mother of his son, the young wife who had given him a\r\nparadise in a strange land.... The princess was not pretty; she seldom\r\nsmiled; her expression was haughty.... Her complexion was fair and\r\nfresh, hair light, eyes blue, teeth very white.... As the princess had\r\nmade up her mind to give her hand to Jerome, it was desirable that she\r\nshould please him, as he certainly regretted his wife; and Miss\r\nPatterson was really his wife and a charming woman.... Her dress was in\r\nuncommon bad taste--the gown of bluish-white _moire_, trimmed in front\r\nwith badly-worked silver embroidery in a forgotten style; a little train\r\nresembling the round tail of a beaver; tight, flat sleeves, pressing the\r\narm above the elbow like a bandage after blood-letting. Her pointed\r\nshoes belonged to the era of King John, the hair old-fashioned in style.\r\nAbout her neck were two rows of very fine pearls, to which was suspended\r\nthe portrait of the prince set in diamonds, and much too large to be\r\nornamental, as it dangled from her neck and bestowed heavy blows at\r\nevery step.... Marshal Bessières had espoused the princess by proxy....\r\nAs Jerome entered she advanced two steps and made him her compliments\r\nwith grace and dignity.... Jerome seemed to be there because he had been\r\ntold 'You must go.' After Jerome retired the princess fainted.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke of Würtemberg was a mere tool in Napoleon's hands, and his\r\npliancy was rewarded. In 1809 the emperor greeted him as _mon\r\nfrère_.--\"Comment, Sire? No longer your cousin?\"--\"You _were_ mon\r\ncousin: you are _now_ Monsieur mon frère!\" And yet the domestic tragedy\r\nof this new _frère_ was known to the imperial king-maker! In 1780 the\r\nduke had married Princess Caroline of Brunswick, young and beautiful,\r\nwho was accused of regarding too favorably a page in her service.\r\nLetters inculpating them were found, a family and state council was\r\nconvened, and the page sentenced to death, while all concurred in the\r\nguilt of the duchess. A divorce was proposed, but finally her death was\r\ndecreed. The page lodged in the palace, his door opening on a corridor\r\nbeneath which were similar corridors, in each of which a trapdoor was\r\nnow arranged, one below the other, a slight flooring concealing the one\r\nimmediately above the apartment of the duchess. As the unsuspicious page\r\nstole at midnight to the rendezvous, the trap yielded, and from floor to\r\nfloor he was dashed, mangled and dead, to the feet of the duchess. The\r\ninfatuated woman, previously warned, had refused to abandon her lover;\r\nbut now she sought escape, was intercepted, and the city executioner\r\nimmediately brought blindfolded to the great hall, where he beheld a\r\nfair, noble woman bound hands and feet. He implored to be spared his\r\nterrible task, but, sworn to secrecy, he was forced under penalty of\r\ninstant death to strike the fatal blow. He drew up a detailed account of\r\nthe double murder and sent it to Baron Bretueil, then French minister of\r\nstate, who laid the matter before King Louis XVI. Jerome's wife was the\r\ndaughter of this unfortunate princess. The duke afterward married a\r\ndaughter of George III. of England.\r\n\r\nMme. Bonaparte's last meeting with Jerome was at the Pitti Palace in\r\nFlorence in 1822, and, singular to say, these once wedded lovers did not\r\nknow each other! She chanced to be attired in her most _recherché_\r\ncostume--a rich silk halfway to the knee, then the mode, displaying\r\ndainty prunella shoes; a gauze hat about three feet in circumference,\r\nwith high-wired bows; a crimson cashmere shawl and large green velvet\r\nreticule. In passing through the gallery she was attracted by the eager,\r\npersistent stare of a very handsome man whom she did not recognize, but\r\nwhose strange likeness to her son enchained her. Suddenly the truth\r\nflashed to her heart: \"It is Jerome!\" He meanwhile, gazing at her, said\r\nto one of the ladies with him, \"Si belle! si belle! qui est-ce?\"--\"Vous\r\ndevriez la connaître, c'est votre première femme,\" replied Mme. Joseph\r\nBonaparte. Jerome started, and with an agitated whisper to the other\r\nlady, the princess Catherine, they left the gallery. For one moment only\r\nthe two \"discrowned queens\" were face to face. The next day Mme.\r\nBonaparte was driving in the Cascine, when from a passing carriage\r\nJerome nearly precipitated himself in a last, lingering look at the wife\r\nof his youth.\r\n\r\nAt that period Florence was the focus of continental social brilliancy,\r\nand Mme. Bonaparte was received with due distinction at its charming\r\ncourt. \"My presentation was special,\" she relates, \"and being superbly\r\ndressed, though caring but little for _chiffons_, I advanced with entire\r\ncomposure and self-satisfaction through the apartments of the Pitti\r\nPalace, crowded with the _élite_ of the court and diplomacy. Preceded by\r\nthe chamberlain, I was welcomed by the grand duke and duchess with such\r\nkindness as quite to overcome me, and I nearly burst into tears; but\r\nsaying to myself, 'Good gracious! I shall spoil my lovely satin gown,\r\nand be thought _bête_ to make a scene,' this reflection restored my\r\nserenity and enabled me to go through the ceremony with becoming\r\ndignity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Si elle etait reine avec quelle grâce elle règnerait,\" said Talleyrand\r\nafter one of their witty jousts, in which he was not always victor. \"She\r\ncharms by her eyes while she slays with her tongue,\" said Count Crillon:\r\nif her unsparing repartee inspired wholesome fear, she disarmed by her\r\ntact, sportive manner and childlike laughter. \"Had she been near the\r\nthrone the Allies would have found it even more difficult to dispose of\r\nNapoleon,\" said Gortschakoff, that brilliant and fascinating Russian,\r\nnoted even then for the astuteness and diplomatic resource that still\r\nsteady the Russian helm through Disraelian and Bismarckian breakers, and\r\nwho now, after fifty years, faithful in friendship, recalls to his\r\n_belle alliée_ the _guerre spirituelle épigrammatique_ of their bright\r\nspring-time. The duke of Buckingham and Chandos in his _Memoirs_ pays\r\ntribute to her talent, piquant charm and \"untarnished name,\" while her\r\nenemy, Prince Napoleon--Plon-Plon--thus characterizes her: \"Ambitieuse,\r\nun esprit indomptable, une réputation sans tâche.\"\r\n\r\nShe writes to Lady Morgan from Paris in 1825: \"I passed only a few\r\nmonths in Rome, where I saw the most beautiful woman in the world, who\r\nhas since died in her husband's palace in Florence, conjugally regretted\r\nby Prince Borghese. He buried her in the handsomest chapel in Europe.\r\nShe left my son a legacy of twenty thousand francs.... I have paid a\r\nshort visit to America. La Fayette was caressed, adored and\r\nsubstantially rewarded. I saw him, and talked to him of you, whom he\r\nloves and admires _malgré le temps et l'absence_. Fanny Wright was with\r\nor near him all the time he was in America. She is to write something of\r\nwhich he is to be the hero.... My son has grown up handsome--a classical\r\nprofile and _un esprit juste_.\"\r\n\r\nAt Rome, Mme. Bonaparte first met her imperial relatives, by all of whom\r\nshe was affectionately welcomed except Madame Mère. \"Qu'est-ce que vous\r\nallez faire à son sujet?\" questioned Pauline Borghese. \"Je n'y ferai\r\nrien;\" and to this armed neutrality she adhered, though by request\r\nsending her son daily to see his grandmother, until at length overtures\r\nwere made and the spirited daughter-in-law received with cordiality.\r\n\"She was not tall,\" says Mme. Bonaparte; \"features like her great son;\r\nfine mournful eyes; a manner touching and majestic. She was then very\r\n_dévote_. Pauline was empty-headed, selfish and vain, cared only for\r\nluxury, but in every line exquisite as Canova's statue represents her.\r\nHortense was not really handsome--irregular features, a wide mouth\r\nexposing the gums and defective teeth, a blemish in her mother, whose\r\nfaultless figure, kindly nature and caressing manner she also inherited.\r\nShe was lovely at the harp, and sang her own _romances_ in a sweet\r\nvoice.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the few celebrities of her day unknown by Mme. Bonaparte was\r\nByron, who had expressed a great wish to meet her, so his friend Captain\r\nMedway told her. \"I hate a dumpy woman,\" says the noble bard; and to\r\nthat complexion did the Guiccioli come at last. Mme. Bonaparte knew her\r\nwell--\"a shower of golden curls; fair, with blue eyes, unlike the\r\ntypical Italian; teeth and hands perfect; naïve and sweet of temper.\r\nByron, she said, took a woman's care of his beauty; slept in gloves--he\r\nwas so proud of his hands--and kept bits of cotton between his teeth to\r\npreserve their regularity.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1839, Mme. Bonaparte writes to Lady Morgan from Paris: \"Death, time\r\nand absence have left me hardly an acquaintance here.... I hardly know\r\nwhich is most distressing--to hear that our friends have gone to the\r\nother world or have forgotten us in this.... My son is gone from Geneva\r\nto Italy to visit his relatives and to see after a legacy which his\r\ngrand-uncle, Cardinal Fesch, had the goodness to leave him.... I have\r\ngrown fat, old and dull--good reasons for persons not to think me an\r\nintelligent listener. They mistake: I have exactly the talent to\r\nappreciate the powers of others. Poor Mme. Junot made a sad end, the\r\nnatural consequence of her prodigality: her pecuniary difficulties, it\r\nis said, caused her death. I liked her very much, and felt pained at the\r\nmisery caused by her want of judgment. Her heart was generous and\r\nwarm.... I know not if the late princess Charlotte, daughter of Joseph\r\nBonaparte, was of your acquaintance: she possessed some mental\r\nsuperiority and many noble qualities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady Morgan,\" says Mme. Bonaparte, \"was brilliant in wit, good-natured\r\nand flattering; short, with sparkling eyes; her hair close cut, in dark\r\ncurls. 'Why is it,' she said to me, 'that you speak French perfectly,\r\nbut English with such an American drawl?'--'For the same reason\r\nprobably that yours is a brogue'--one of the miseries of her life.\"\r\n\r\n\"BALTIMORE, 1849.... No one expects me to be grateful for the evil\r\nchance of having been born here. Society and conversation belong to\r\nolder countries: you ought to thank your stars for your European\r\nbirth.... France, _je l'espère_, is in a transition state, and will not\r\nlet her brilliancy be put under an extinguisher called _la République_.\r\nThe emperor hurled me back on what I most hated on earth, my Baltimore\r\nobscurity: even that shock could not destroy the admiration I felt for\r\nhis genius and glory. I have ever been an imperial Bonapartist _quand\r\nmême_, and am enchanted at the homage paid by six millions of voices to\r\nhis memory in voting an imperial President: the prestige of the name has\r\nelected a prince who has my most ardent wishes for an empire. Dear Lady\r\nMorgan, having been cheated out of my inheritance from my late rich and\r\nunjust father, I have only ten thousand dollars annually. You speak of\r\nmy 'princely' income. I have all my life been tortured and mortified by\r\npecuniary difficulties: but for my industry, energy and determination to\r\nconquer a decent sufficiency to live on in Europe, I might have remained\r\nas poor as you first saw me.... Lamartine and Chateaubriand are giving\r\ntheir memoirs to the public: the first _de son vivant_. When I knew\r\nLamartine he was chargé d'affaires from Charles X. Florence was then a\r\ncharming place. I met him every night in society. How little did I\r\nforesee that he was to become a poetical republican, and that dear\r\nFlorence was to be travestied in a republic! Hoping that England may\r\nremain steady and faithful to monarchical principles, that at least some\r\nrefined society may be left in the world, I shall, _Dieu permettant_,\r\nhave the satisfaction of seeing you next summer.\"\r\n\r\nNeither the climate nor \"the freezing social _convenance_\" of England\r\npleased Mme. Bonaparte, though she was received with distinction.\r\n\"Abroad, these fair insulars _occasionally_ unbend and are charming\" she\r\nsays, \"but at all times I have found Englishmen of birth the best bred\r\nand most agreeable men in the world.\"\r\n\r\nSince her withdrawal from European life Mme. Bonaparte has lived\r\nsecluded from society. Baltimore's shrewdest banker says that he knows\r\n\"no man capable of creating legitimately, with so small a capital, the\r\nlarge fortune amassed by Mme. Bonaparte.\" She has no accomplishment in\r\nany branch of art, and although her love of study remains, her\r\nfast-increasing blindness deprives her of this resource. Her diary, if\r\never given to the public, will have the effect of a shower of cayenne;\r\nbut her _magnum opus_, which discretion will probably forbid seeing the\r\nlight, is entitled _Dialogues of the Dead_, the scene being laid in\r\nHades, where her father and King Jerome rehearse her story. Her wit is\r\nstill incisive, her conversation replete with interest, her memory\r\nretaining minutely every incident and figure of the wondrous diorama\r\nthat has unrolled before her eyes close upon a hundred years. Her birth\r\nwas nearly coeval with that of our republic, many of whose fathers she\r\nknew. She wept as the tidings of Marie Antoinette's tragedy reached our\r\nshores; she was a woman when Washington died; Jefferson was her friend;\r\nLa Fayette has held her hand; and her name is imperishably associated\r\nwith one \"who kept the world at bay, whose game was empires, whose\r\nstakes were thrones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUMMER EVENING'S DREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a village street, with great elms on either side, while along the\r\nmiddle stands another row set in a narrow strip of grassy common, so\r\nthat the street and roadway are in reality double. The dwellings on\r\neither side are not only widely parted by the broad street, but are\r\nstill further isolated, each in its large garden of ancient fruit trees.\r\nIt is four o'clock of a sunny August afternoon, and a quiet,\r\nSabbath-like but for its lazy voluptuousness, broods over the scene. No\r\ncarriage, or even pedestrian, has passed for an hour. The occasional\r\nvoices of children at play in some garden, the latching of a gate far\r\ndown the street, the dying fall of a drowsy chanticleer, are but the\r\npunctuation of the poem of summer silence that has been flowing on all\r\nthe afternoon. Upon the tree-tops the sun blazes brightly, and between\r\ntheir stems are glimpses of outlying meadows, which simmer in the heat\r\nas if about to come to a boil. But the shadowed street offers a cool and\r\nrefreshing vista to the eye and a veritable valley of refuge to the\r\nparched and dusty traveller along the highway.\r\n\r\nOn the broad piazza of one of the quaint old-fashioned houses, behind a\r\nneedless screen of climbing woodbine, two girls are whiling away the\r\nafternoon. One of them is lounging in a lazy rocking-chair, while the\r\nother sits more primly and is industriously sewing.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you'll be glad enough to see George when he comes to-night to\r\ntake you back to the city? I'm afraid you find it pretty dull here,\"\r\nsaid the latter with an intonation of uneasy responsibility sufficiently\r\nattesting that the brilliant-looking girl opposite was a guest.\r\n\r\nThat young lady when addressed was indulging in a luxurious country\r\nyawn, an operation by no means to be hurried, but to be fully and lazily\r\nenjoyed in all its several and long-drawn stages, and as thus practised\r\na wonderfully calming and soporific relaxation wholly unknown to the\r\nfretted denizens of cities, whose yawn is one of irritation and not of\r\nrest. \"I do so enjoy your Plainfield yawns, Lucy,\" she said when she had\r\nquite finished. \"Were you saying that it was a little dull? Well,\r\nperhaps it is, but then the trees and things seem to be enjoying\r\nthemselves so hugely that it would be selfish to make a fuss, even if it\r\nisn't exactly my kind of fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your kind of fun is due by the six-o'clock stage, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nThe other laughed and said, \"I wish you wouldn't make another allusion\r\nto George. I think of him so much that I'm ashamed as it is. I'm sure\r\nthis is a very aggravating place for an engaged girl to be at. One gets\r\nso dreadfully sentimental with nothing to take up the mind, especially\r\nwith such monstrous moons as you have. I got fairly frightened of the\r\none last night. It drew me out through my eyes like a big plaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mabel French!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care: it did. That was just the feeling.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no hurry about talking, for the rich, mellow summer silence\r\nhad a body to it that prevented pauses from seeming empty, and it might\r\nhave been half an hour afterward that Mabel suddenly leaned forward,\r\nputting her face close to the vine-trellis, and cried in a low voice,\r\n\"Who's that? Do tell me! They're the very first persons who have gone by\r\nthis afternoon, I do believe.\"\r\n\r\nA pretty phaeton was slowly passing, containing an elderly gentleman and\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is only Lawyer Morgan and old Miss Rood,\" replied Lucy, just\r\nglancing up, and then down again. \"They go out driving once a week\r\nregularly, and always at about this time in the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"They look like afternoon sort of people,\" said Mabel. \"But why doesn't\r\nLawyer Morgan take out his wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't got any. Miss Rood comes nearest to that. Oh no, you needn't\r\nopen your eyes: there's not a properer old maid in town, or old bachelor\r\neither, for that matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they relatives?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long has this Platonic romance been going on, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ever since they were young--forty years perhaps. I only know by\r\ntradition, you see. It began ages before my day. They say she was very\r\npretty once. Old Aunty Perkins remembers that she was quite the belle of\r\nthe village as a girl. It seems strange, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me the whole story,\" said Mabel, turning round so as to face Lucy\r\nas the phaeton passed out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"There's not much to tell. Mr. Morgan has always lived here, and so has\r\nMiss Rood. He lives alone with a housekeeper in that fine house at the\r\nend of the street, and she entirely alone in that little white house\r\nover there among the apple trees. All the people who knew them when they\r\nwere young are dead, gone away or moved off. They are relics of a past\r\ngeneration, and are really about as much shut up to each other for\r\nsympathy as an old married couple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why on earth aren't they married?\"\r\n\r\n\"People hereabouts got tired of asking that full thirty years ago,\"\r\nreplied Lucy with a little shrug. \"Even the gossips long since wore out\r\nthe subject, and I believe we have all of us forgotten that there is\r\nanything peculiar about their relations. He calls on her two or three\r\ntimes a week, and takes her out driving on pleasant days; escorts her to\r\nplaces of amusement or social gatherings when either of them cares to\r\ngo, which isn't often; and wherever they are, people take it for granted\r\nthey will pair off together. He is never seen with any other lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very strange,\" said Mabel thoughtfully, \"and I'm sure it's very\r\nromantic. Queer old couple! I wonder how they really feel toward each\r\nother, and whether they wouldn't like to be married?\"\r\n\r\nA while after she suddenly demanded, \"Don't you think Miss Rood looks\r\nlike me?\"\r\n\r\nLucy laughed at first, but upon closer inspection of the fair questioner\r\nadmitted that there might be some such resemblance as the shrivelled\r\napples brought up from the cellar in spring bear to the plump,\r\nrosy-cheeked beauties that went down in October.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Morgan and Miss Rood, as they rode past, had chanced to overhear\r\nMabel's question why they had not married, it would have affected them\r\nvery differently. He would have been startled by the novelty of an idea\r\nthat had not occurred to him in twenty years, but the blush on her cheek\r\nwould have been one of painful consciousness.\r\n\r\nAs boy and girl they had been each other's chosen companion, and as\r\nyoung man and maiden their childish preference had bloomed into a\r\nreciprocal love. Thanks to the freedom and simplicity of village life,\r\nthey enjoyed as lovers a constant and easy familiarity and daily\r\nassociation almost as complete in sympathy of mind and heart as anything\r\nmarriage could offer. There were none of the usual obstacles to incite\r\nthem to matrimony. They were never even formally engaged, so wholly did\r\nthey take it for granted that they should marry. It was so much a matter\r\nof course that there was no hurry at all about it; and besides, so long\r\nas they had it to look forward to the foreground of life was illuminated\r\nfor them: it was still morning. Mr. Morgan was constitutionally of a\r\ndreamy and unpractical turn, a creature of habits and a victim of ruts;\r\nand as years rolled on he became more and more satisfied with these\r\nhalf-friendly, half-loverlike relations. He never found the time when it\r\nseemed an object to marry, and now, for very many years, the idea had\r\nnot even occurred to him as possible; and so far was he from the least\r\nsuspicion that Miss Rood's experience had not been precisely similar to\r\nhis own, that he often congratulated himself on the fortunate\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\nTime cures much, and many years ago Miss Rood had recovered from the\r\nfirst bitterness of discovering that his love had become insensibly\r\ntransformed into a very tender but perfectly peaceful friendship. No\r\none but him had ever touched her heart, and she had no interest in life\r\nbesides him. Since she was not to be his wife, she was glad to be his\r\nlifelong, tender, self-sacrificing friend. So she raked the ashes over\r\nthe fire in her heart, and left him to suppose that it had gone out as\r\nin his. Nor was she without compensation in their friendship. It was\r\nwith a delightful thrill that she felt how fully in mind and heart he\r\nleaned and depended upon her, and the unusual and romantic character of\r\ntheir relations in some degree consoled her for the disappointment of\r\nwomanly aspirations by a feeling of distinction. She was not like other\r\nwomen: her lot was set apart and peculiar. She looked down upon her sex.\r\nThe conventionality of women's lives renders their vanity peculiarly\r\nsusceptible to a suggestion that their destiny is in any respect\r\nunique--a fact that has served the turn of many a seducer before now.\r\n\r\nTo-day, after returning from his drive with Miss Rood, Mr. Morgan had\r\nwalked in his garden, and as the evening breeze arose, it bore to his\r\nnostrils that first indescribable flavor of autumn which warns us that\r\nthe soul of Summer has departed from her yet glowing body. He was very\r\nsensitive to these changes of the year, and, obeying an impulse that had\r\nbeen familiar to him in all unusual moods his life long, he left the\r\nhouse after tea and turned his steps down the street. As he stopped at\r\nMiss Rood's gate, Lucy, Mabel and George Hammond were under the apple\r\ntrees in the garden opposite.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Mabel! There's Mr. Morgan going to call on Miss Rood,\" said Lucy\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do look, George!\" said Mabel eagerly. \"That old gentleman has been\r\npaying court to an old maid over in that little house for forty years.\r\nAnd to think,\" she added in a lower tone, intended for his private ear,\r\n\"what a fuss you make about waiting six months!\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! You please to forget that it's easier to wait for some things\r\nthan for others. Six months of my kind of waiting, I take it, require\r\nmore patience than forty years of his--or any other man's,\" he added\r\nwith increased emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, sir!\" replied Mabel, answering his look of unruly admiration\r\nwith one of half pique. \"I'm not a sugar-plum, that's not enjoyed till\r\nit's in the mouth. If you haven't got me now, you'll never have me. If\r\nbeing engaged isn't enough, you don't deserve to be married.\" And then,\r\nseeing the blank expression with which he looked down at her, she added\r\nwith a prescient resignedness, \"I'm afraid, dear, you'll be so\r\ndisappointed when we're married if you find this so tedious.\"\r\n\r\nLucy had discreetly wandered away, and of how they made it up there were\r\nno witnesses. But it seems likely that they did so, for shortly after\r\nthey wandered away together down the darkening street.\r\n\r\nLike most of the Plainfield houses, that at which Mr. Morgan turned in\r\nstood well back from the street. At a side window, still further\r\nsheltered from view by a syringa-bush at the house corner, sat a little\r\nwoman with a small pale face, the still attractive features perceptibly\r\nsharpened by years, of which the half-gray hair bore further testimony.\r\nThe eyes, just now fixed absently upon the dusking landscape, were light\r\ngray and a little faded, while around the lips there were crowsfeet,\r\nespecially when they were pressed together, as now, in an unsatisfied,\r\nalmost pathetic look, evidently habitual to her face when in repose.\r\nThere was withal something in her features that so reminded you of Mr.\r\nMorgan that any one conversant with the facts of his life-romance would\r\nhave at once inferred--though by just what logic he might not be able to\r\nexplain--that this must be Miss Rood. It is well known that long-wedded\r\ncouples often gain at length a certain resemblance in feature and\r\nmanner; and although these two were not married, yet their intimacy of a\r\nlifetime was perhaps the reason why her face bore when in repose\r\nsomething of that seer-like expression which communion with the bodiless\r\nshapes of memory had given to his.\r\n\r\nThe latching of the gate broke up her depressing revery and banished the\r\npinched and pining look from her features. Among the neighbors Miss Rood\r\nwas sometimes called a sour old maid, but the face she kept for Mr.\r\nMorgan would never have suggested that idea to the most ill-natured\r\ncritic.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the window, near which the walk passed to the doorway, and\r\nstood leaning on the sill--a tall slender figure, stooping a little,\r\nwith smooth scholarly face and thin iron-gray hair. His only noticeable\r\nfeature was a pair of eyes whose expression and glow indicated an\r\nimaginative temperament. It was pleasant to observe the relieved\r\nrestlessness in the look and manner of the two friends, as if at the\r\nmere being in each other's presence, though neither seemed in any haste\r\nto exchange even the words of formal greeting.\r\n\r\nAt length she said in a tone of quiet satisfaction, \"I knew you would\r\ncome, for I was sure this deathly autumn's flavor would make you\r\nrestless. Isn't it strange how it affects the nerves of memory and makes\r\none sad with thinking of all the sweet dear days that are dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" he answered eagerly: \"I can think of nothing else. Do they\r\nnot seem wonderfully clear and near to-night? To-night, of all nights in\r\nthe year, if the figures and scenes of memory can be re-embodied in\r\nvisible forms, they ought to become so to the eyes that strain and yearn\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a fanciful idea, Robert!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that it is: I don't feel sure. Nobody understands the\r\nmystery of this Past, or what are the conditions of existence in that\r\nworld. These memories, these forms and faces, that are so near, so\r\nalmost warm and visible that we find ourselves smiling on the vacant air\r\nwhere they seem to be, are they not real and living?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean you believe in ghosts?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not talking of ghosts of the dead, but of ghosts of the\r\npast--memories of scenes or persons, whether the persons are dead or\r\nnot--of our own selves as well as others. Why,\" he continued, his voice\r\nsoftening into a passionate, yearning tenderness, \"the figure I would\r\ngive most to see just once more is yourself as a girl, as I remember you\r\nin the sweet grace and beauty of your maidenhood. Ah well! ah well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" she cried involuntarily, while her features contracted in\r\nsudden pain.\r\n\r\nIn the years during which his passion for her had been cooling into a\r\nstaid friendship his imagination had been recurring with constantly\r\nincreasing fondness and a dreamy passion to the memory of her girlhood.\r\nAnd the cruellest part of it was that he so unconsciously and\r\nunquestioningly assumed that she could not have identity enough with\r\nthat girlish ideal to make his frequent glowing references to it even\r\nembarrassing. Generally, however, she heard and made no sign, but the\r\nsuddenness of his outburst just now had taken her off her guard.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up with some surprise at her exclamation, but was too much\r\ninterested in his subject to take much notice of it. \"You know,\" he\r\nsaid, \"there are great differences in the distinctness with which we can\r\nbring up our memories. Very well! The only question is, What is the\r\nlimit to that distinctness, or is there any? Since we know there are\r\nsuch wide degrees in distinctness, the burden of proof rests on those\r\nwho would prove that those degrees stop short of any particular point.\r\nDon't you see, then, that it might be possible to see them?\" And to\r\nenforce his meaning he laid his hand lightly on hers as it rested on the\r\nwindow-seat.\r\n\r\nShe withdrew it instantly from the contact, and a slight flush tinged\r\nher sallow cheeks. The only outward trace of her memory of their\r\nyouthful relations was the almost prudish chariness of her person by\r\nwhich she indicated a sense of the line to be drawn between the former\r\nlover and the present friend.\r\n\r\n\"Something in your look just now,\" he said, regarding her musingly, as\r\none who seeks to trace the lineaments of a dead face in a living one,\r\n\"reminds me of you as you used to sit in this very window as a girl, and\r\nI stood just here, and we picked out stars together. There! now it's\r\ngone;\" and he turned away regretfully.\r\n\r\nShe looked at his averted face with a blank piteousness which revealed\r\nall her secret. She would not have had him see it for worlds, but it was\r\na relief just for a moment to rest her features in the sad cast which\r\nthe muscles had grown tired in repressing. The autumn scent rose\r\nstronger as the air grew damp, and he stood breathing it in, and\r\napparently feeling its influence like some Delphian afflatus.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything, Mary--is there anything so beautiful as that light\r\nof eternity that rests on the figures of memory? Who that has once felt\r\nit can care for the common daylight of the present any more, or take\r\npleasure in its prosaic groups?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll certainly catch cold standing in that wet grass: do come in and\r\nlet me shut the blinds,\" she said, for she had found cheerful lamplight\r\nthe best corrective for his vagaries.\r\n\r\nSo he came in and sat in his special arm-chair, and they chatted about\r\nmiscellaneous village topics for an hour. The standpoint from which they\r\ncanvassed Plainfield people and things was a peculiarly outside one.\r\nTheir circle of two was like a separate planet from which they observed\r\nthe world. Their tone was like, and yet quite unlike, that in which a\r\nlong-married couple discuss their acquaintances; for, while their\r\nintellectual intimacy was perfect, their air expressed a constant mutual\r\ndeference and solicitude of approbation not to be confounded with the\r\nterrible familiarity of matrimony; and at the same time they constituted\r\na self-sufficient circle, apart from the society around them, as man and\r\nwife cannot. Man and wife are so far merged as to feel themselves a unit\r\nover against society. They are too much identified to find in each other\r\nthat sense of support and countenance which requires a feeling of the\r\nexteriority of our friend's life to our own. If these two should marry\r\nthey would shortly find themselves impelled to seek refuge in\r\nconventional relations with that society of which now they were calmly\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nAt length Mr. Morgan rose and threw open the blinds. The radiance of the\r\nfull harvest-moon so flooded the room that Miss Rood was fain to blow\r\nout the poor lamp for compassion. \"Let us take a walk,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe streets were empty and still, and they walked in silence, spelled by\r\nthe perfect beauty of the evening. The dense shadows of the elms lent a\r\npeculiarly rich effect to the occasional bars and patches of moonlight\r\non the street floor; the white houses gleamed among their orchards; and\r\nhere and there, between the dark tree-stems, there were glimpses of the\r\nshining surface of the broad outlying meadows, which looked like a\r\nsurrounding sea.\r\n\r\nMiss Rood was startled to see how the witchery of the scene possessed\r\nher companion. His face took on a set, half-smiling expression, and he\r\ndropped her arm as if they had arrived at the place of entertainment to\r\nwhich he had been escorting her. He no longer walked with measured pace,\r\nbut glided along with a certain stealthiness, peering on this side and\r\nthat down moony vistas and into shadow-bowers, as if half expecting, if\r\nhe might step lightly enough, to catch a glimpse of some sort of\r\ndream-people basking there.\r\n\r\nNor could Miss Rood herself resist the impression the moony landscape\r\ngave of teeming with subtle forms of life, escaping the grosser senses\r\nof human beings, but perceptible by their finer parts. Each cosey nook\r\nof light and shadow was yet warm from some presence that had just left\r\nit. The landscape fairly stirred with ethereal forms of being beneath\r\nthe fertilizing moon-rays, as the earth-mould wakes into physical life\r\nunder the sun's heat. The yellow moonlight looked warm as spirits might\r\ncount warmth. The air was electric with the thrill of circumambient\r\nexistence. There was the sense of pressure, of a throng. It would have\r\nbeen impossible to feel lonely. The pulsating sounds of the insect world\r\nseemed the rhythm to which the voluptuous beauty of the night had\r\nspontaneously set itself. The common air of day had been transmuted\r\ninto the atmosphere of revery and Dreamland. In that magic medium the\r\ndistinction between imagination and reality fast dissolved. Even Miss\r\nRood was conscious of a delightful excitement, a vague expectancy. Mr.\r\nMorgan, she saw, was moved quite beyond even his exaggerated habit of\r\nimaginative excitement. His wet, shining, wide-opened eyes and ecstatic\r\nexpression indicated complete abandonment to the illusions of the scene.\r\n\r\nThey had seated themselves, as the concentration of the brain upon\r\nimaginative activity made the nerves of motion sluggish, upon a rude\r\nbench formed by wedging a plank between two elms that stood close\r\ntogether. They were within the shadow of the trees, but close up to\r\ntheir feet rippled a lake of moonlight. The landscape shimmering before\r\nthem had been the theatre of their fifty years of life. Their history\r\nwas written in its trees and lawns and paths. The very air of the place\r\nhad acquired for them a dense, warm, sentient feeling, to which that of\r\nall other places was thin and raw. It had become tinctured by their own\r\nspiritual emanations, by the thoughts, looks, words and moods of which\r\nit had so long received the impression. It had become such vitalized\r\nair, surcharged with sense and thought, as might be taken to make souls\r\nfor men out of.\r\n\r\nOver yonder, upon the playground, yet lingered the faint violet\r\nfragrance of their childhood. Beneath that elm a kiss had once touched\r\nthe air with a fire that still warmed their cheeks in passing. Yonder\r\nthe look of a face was cut on the viewless air as on marble. Surely,\r\ndeath does but touch the living, for the dead ever keep their power over\r\nus: it is only we who lose ours over them. Each vista of leafy arch and\r\ndistant meadow framed in some scene of their youth-time, painted in the\r\nimperishable hues of memory that borrow from time an ever-richer and\r\nmore glowing tint. It was no wonder that to these two old people,\r\nsitting on the bench between the elms, the atmosphere before them,\r\nsaturated with associations, dense with memories, should seem fairly\r\nquivering into material forms like a distant mist turning to rain.\r\n\r\nAt length Miss Rood heard her companion say, in a whisper of tremulous\r\nexultation, \"Do you know, Mary, I think I shall see them very soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"See whom?\" she asked, frightened at his strange tone.\r\n\r\n\"Why, see us, of course, as I was telling you,\" he whispered--\"you and\r\nme as we were young--see them as I see you now. Don't you remember it\r\nwas just along here that we used to walk on spring evenings? We walk\r\nhere no more, but they do evermore, beautiful, beautiful children. I\r\ncome here often to lie in wait for them. I can feel them now: I can\r\nalmost, almost see them.\" His whisper became scarcely audible and the\r\nwords dropped slowly. \"I know the sight is coming, for every day they\r\ngrow more vivid. It can't be long before I quite see them. It may come\r\nat any moment.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Rood was thoroughly frightened at the intensity of his excitement,\r\nand terribly perplexed as to what she should do.\r\n\r\n\"It may come at any time: I can almost see them now,\" he murmured.\r\n\"A--h! look!\" With parted lips and unspeakably intense eyes, as if his\r\nlife were flowing out at them, he was staring across the moonlit paths\r\nbefore them to the point where the path debouched from the shadow.\r\n\r\nFollowing his eyes, she saw what for a moment made her head swim with\r\nthe thought that she too was going mad. Just issuing from the shadows,\r\nas if in answer to his words, were a young man and a girl, his arm upon\r\nher waist, his eyes upon her face. At the first glance Miss Rood was\r\nimpressed with a resemblance to her own features in those of the girl,\r\nwhich her excitement exaggerated to a perfect reproduction of them. For\r\nan instant the conviction possessed her that by some impossible,\r\nindescribable, inconceivable miracle she was looking upon the\r\nresurrected figures of her girlish self and her lover.\r\n\r\nAt first, Mr. Morgan had half started from his seat, and was between\r\nrising and sitting. Then he rose with a slow, involuntary movement,\r\nwhile his face worked terribly between bewilderment and abandonment to\r\nillusion. He tottered forward a few steps to the edge of the moonlight,\r\nand stood peering at the approaching couple with a hand raised to shade\r\nhis eyes and a dazed, unearthly smile on his face. The girl saw him\r\nfirst, for she had been gazing demurely before her, while her lover\r\nlooked only at her. At sight of the gray-haired man suddenly confronting\r\nthem with a look of bedlam, she shrieked and started back in terror.\r\nMiss Rood, recalled to her senses, sprang forward, and catching Mr.\r\nMorgan's arm endeavored with gentle force to draw him away.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late for that. The young man, at first almost as much\r\nstartled as his companion at the uncanny apparition, naturally\r\nexperienced a revulsion of indignation at such an extraordinary\r\ninterruption to his tête-à-tête, and stepped up to Mr. Morgan as if\r\nabout to inflict summary chastisement. But perceiving that he had to do\r\nwith an elderly man, he contented himself with demanding in a decidedly\r\naggressive tone what the devil he meant by such a performance.\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan stared at him without seeing him, and evidently did not take\r\nin the words. He merely gasped once or twice, and looked as if he had\r\nfainted away on his feet. His blank, stunned expression showed that his\r\nfaculties were momentarily benumbed by the shock. Miss Rood felt as if\r\nshe should die for the pity of it as she looked at his face, and her\r\nheart was breaking for grief as she sought to mollify the young man with\r\nsome inarticulate words of apology, meanwhile still endeavoring to draw\r\nMr. Morgan away. But at this moment the girl, recovering from her panic,\r\ncame up to the group and laid her hand on the young man's arm, as if to\r\ncheck and silence him. It was evident that she saw there was something\r\nquite unusual in the circumstances, and the look which she bent upon Mr.\r\nMorgan was one of sympathy and considerate interrogation. But Miss Rood\r\ncould see no way out of their awkward situation, which grew more\r\nintolerable every moment as they thus confronted each other. It was\r\nfinally Mr. Morgan's voice, quite firm, but with an indescribable\r\nsadness in the tones, which broke the silence: \"Young people, I owe you\r\nan apology, such as it is. I am an old man, and the past is growing so\r\nheavy that it sometimes quite over-balances me. My thoughts have been\r\nbusy to-night with the days of my youth, and the spell of memory has\r\nbeen so strong that I have not been quite myself. As you came in view I\r\nactually entertained the incredible idea for a moment that somehow I saw\r\nin you the materialized memories of myself and another as we once walked\r\nthis same path.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man bowed as Mr. Morgan ended in a manner indicating his\r\nacceptance of the apology, although he looked both amazed and amused.\r\nBut the explanation had a very different effect upon the girl at his\r\nside. As she listened her eyes had filled with tears and her face had\r\ntaken on a wonderfully tender, pitiful smile. When he ended speaking,\r\nshe impulsively said, \"I'm so sorry we were not what you thought us! Why\r\nnot pretend we are, to-night at least? We can pretend it, you know. The\r\nmoonlight makes anything possible;\" and then glancing at Miss Rood, she\r\nadded, as if almost frightened, \"Why, how much we look alike! I'm not\r\nsure it isn't true, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nThis was, in fact, an unusually marked example of those casual\r\nresemblances between strangers which are sometimes seen. The hair of the\r\none was indeed gray and that of the other dark, but the eyes were of the\r\nsame color by night, and the features, except for the greater fulness of\r\nthe younger face, were cast in the same mould, while figure and bearing\r\nwere strikingly similar, although daylight would doubtless have revealed\r\ndiversities enough that moonlight refused to disclose.\r\n\r\nThe two women looked at each other with an expression almost of\r\nsuspicion and fear, while the young man observed, \"Your mistake was\r\ncertainly excusable, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be the easier to pretend,\" said the girl as with a\r\nhalf-serious, half-sportive imperiousness she laid her hand on Mr.\r\nMorgan's arm. \"And now it is thirty years ago, and we are walking\r\ntogether.\" He involuntarily obeyed the slight pressure, and they walked\r\nslowly away, leaving the other two after an embarrassed pause to follow\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFor some time they walked in silence. He was deliberately abandoning\r\nhimself to the illusion, supported as it was by the evidence of his\r\nsenses, that he was wandering in some of the mysterious between-worlds\r\nwhich he had so often dreamed of, with the love of his youth in her\r\nyouth-time charm. Did he really believe it to be so? Belief is a term\r\nquite irrelevant to such a frame as his, in which the reflective and\r\nanalytical powers are for a time purposely held in abeyance. The\r\ncircumstances of her introduction to him had dropped from his mind as\r\nirrelevant accidents, like the absurdities which occur in our sweetest\r\nand most solemn dreams without marring their general impression in our\r\nmemories. Every glance he threw upon his companion, while on the one\r\nhand it shocked his illusion in that she seemed not likely to vanish\r\naway, on the other strengthened it with an indescribable thrill by the\r\nrevelation of some fresh trait of face or figure, some new expression,\r\nthat reproduced the Miss Rood of his youth. Not, indeed, that it is\r\nlikely his companion was thus perfectly the double of that lady,\r\nalthough so much resembling her, but the common graces of maidenhood\r\nwere in Mr. Morgan's mind the peculiar personal qualities of the only\r\nwoman he had ever much known.\r\n\r\nOf his own accord he would not have dared to risk breaking the charm by\r\na word. But his companion--who, as is tolerably evident by this time,\r\nwas Mabel French--had meanwhile formed a scheme quite worthy of her\r\naudacious temper. She had at once recognized both Mr. Morgan and Miss\r\nRood, and had gone thus far from a mere romantic impulse, without\r\ndefinite intentions of any sort. But the idea now came into her head\r\nthat she might take advantage of this extraordinary situation to try a\r\nmatchmaking experiment, which instantly captivated her fancy. So she\r\nsaid, while ever so gently pressing his arm and looking up into his face\r\nwith an arch smile (she was recognized as the best amateur actress in\r\nher set at home), \"I wonder if the moon will be so mellow after we are\r\nmarried?\"\r\n\r\nHis illusion was rudely disturbed by the shock of an articulate voice,\r\nsoftly and low as she spoke, and he looked around with a startled\r\nexpression that made her fear her rôle was ended. But she could not know\r\nthat the eyes she turned to his were mirrors where he saw his dead\r\nyouth. The two Miss Roods--the girl and the woman, the past and the\r\npresent--were fused and become one in his mind. Their identity flashed\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nAn artesian well sunk from the desert surface through the underlying\r\nstrata, the layers of ages, strikes some lake long ago covered over, and\r\nthe water welling up converts the upper waste into a garden. Just so at\r\nher words and her look his heart suddenly filled, as if it came from\r\nafar, with the youthful passion he had felt toward Miss Rood, but which,\r\nhe knew not exactly when or how, had been gradually overgrown with the\r\ndulness of familiarity and had lapsed into an indolent affectionate\r\nhabit. The warm voluptuous pulse of this new feeling--new, and yet\r\ninstantly recognized as old--brought with it a flood of youthful\r\nassociations, and commingled the far past with the present in a\r\nconfusion more complete and more intoxicating than ever. He saw double\r\nagain. \"Married!\" he murmured dreamily. \"Yes, surely, we will be\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke he looked at her with such a peculiar expression that\r\nshe was a little frightened. It looked like a more serious business than\r\nshe had counted on, and for a moment if she could have cut and run,\r\nperhaps she would have done so. But she had a strain of the true\r\nhistrionic artist about her, and with a little effort rose to the\r\ndifficulty of the rôle. \"Of course we will be married,\" she replied with\r\nan air of innocent surprise. \"You speak as if you had just thought of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned toward her as if he would sober his senses by staring at her,\r\nhis pupils dilating and contracting in the instinctive effort to clear\r\nthe mind by clearing the eyes.\r\n\r\nBut with a steady pressure on his arm she compelled him to walk on by\r\nher side. Then she said, in a soft low voice, as if a little awed by\r\nwhat she were telling, while at the same time she nestled nearer his\r\nside, \"I had such a sad dream last night, and your strange talk reminds\r\nme of it. It seemed as if we were old and white-haired and stooping, and\r\nwent wandering about, still together, but not married, lonely and\r\nbroken. And I woke up feeling you can't think how dreary and sad--as if\r\na bell had tolled in my ears as I slept; and the feeling was so strong\r\nthat I put my fingers to my face to find if it was withered; and when I\r\ncould not tell certainly, I got up and lit my lamp and looked in the\r\nglass; and my face, thank God! was fresh and young; but I sat on my bed\r\nand cried to think of the poor old people I had left behind in my\r\ndream.\"\r\n\r\nMabel had so fallen into the spirit of her part that she was really\r\ncrying as she ended. Her tears completed Mr. Morgan's mental confusion,\r\nand he absolutely did not know whom he was addressing or where he was\r\nhimself, as he cried, \"No, no, Mary! Don't cry! It shall not be: it\r\nshall never be.\"\r\n\r\nLightly withdrawing her hand from his arm, she glided like a sprite from\r\nhis side, and was lost in the shadows, while her whispered words still\r\nsounded in his ear, \"Good-bye for thirty years!\"\r\n\r\nA moment after three notes, clear as a bird's call, sounded from the\r\ndirection whither she had vanished, and Miss Rood's companion, breaking\r\noff short a remark on the excessive dryness of the weather, bowed\r\nawkwardly and also disappeared among the shadows.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Rood laid her hand on Mr. Morgan's arm to recall him to the\r\nfact that they were now alone together, he turned quickly, and his eyes\r\nswept her from head to foot, and then rested on her face with an\r\nexpression of intense curiosity and a wholly new interest, as if he were\r\ntracing out a suddenly-suggested resemblance which overwhelmed him with\r\nemotion. And as he gazed his eyes began to take fire from the faded\r\nfeatures on which they had rested so many years in mere complacent\r\nfriendliness, and she instinctively averted her face. Long intimacy had\r\nmade her delicately sensitive to his moods, and when he drew her arm in\r\nhis and turned to walk, although he had not uttered a word, she trembled\r\nwith agitation.\r\n\r\n\"Mary, we have had an extraordinary experience to-night,\" he said. The\r\nold dreaminess in his voice, as of one narcotized or in a trance,\r\nsometimes a little forced, as of one trying to dream, to which she had\r\nbecome accustomed, and of which in her heart of hearts she was very\r\nweary, was gone. In its place she recognized a resonance which still\r\nfurther confused her with a sense of altered relations. His polarity had\r\nchanged: his electricity was no longer negative, but positive.\r\n\r\nHer feminine instinct vaguely alarmed, she replied, \"Yes, indeed, but it\r\nis getting late. Hadn't we better go in?\" What lent the unusual\r\nintonation of timidity to her voice? Certainly nothing that she could\r\nhave explained.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite yet, Mary,\" he answered, turning his gaze once more fully\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nHer eyes dropped before his, and a moment after fluttered up to find an\r\nexplanation for their behavior, only to fall again in blind panic. For,\r\nmingling unmistakably with the curiosity with which he was still\r\nstudying her features, was a new-born expression of appropriation and\r\npassionate complacency. Her senses whirled in a bewilderment that had a\r\nsuffocating sweetness about it. Though she now kept her eyes on the\r\nground, she felt his constant sidewise glances, and, desperately seeking\r\nrelief from the conscious silence that enveloped them like a vapor of\r\nintoxicating fumes, she forced herself to utter the merest triviality\r\nshe could summon to her lips: \"See that house.\" The husky tones betrayed\r\nmore agitation than the ruse concealed.\r\n\r\nHe answered as irrelevantly as she had spoken, \"Yes, indeed, so it is.\"\r\nThat was their only attempt at conversation.\r\n\r\nFor a half hour--it might have been much more or much less--they walked\r\nin this way, thrilling with the new magnetism that at once attracted and\r\nestranged them with an extraordinary sense of strangeness in\r\nfamiliarity. At length they paused under the little porch of Miss Rood's\r\ncottage, where he commonly bade her good-evening after their walks. The\r\ntimidity and vague alarms that had paralyzed her while they were walking\r\ndisappeared as he was about to leave her, and she involuntarily\r\nreturned his unusual pressure of her hand.\r\n\r\nA long time after behold her still encircled in his arms, not blushing,\r\nbut pale and her eyes full of a soft astonished glow! \"Oh, Robert!\" was\r\nall she had said after one first little gasp.\r\n\r\nThey never met George or Mabel again. Mrs. Morgan learned subsequently\r\nthat two young people from the city answering their description had been\r\nguests at the opposite house, and had left Plainfield the morning after\r\nthe events hereinbefore set forth, and drew her conclusions accordingly.\r\nBut her husband preferred to cherish the secret belief that his theory\r\nthat memories might become visible had proved true in one instance at\r\nleast. EDWARD BELLAMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRANDYWINE, 1777.\r\n\r\n\r\nToward noon of a September day, the fifth of the week and the eleventh\r\nof the month, 1777, a few of the steady meeting-going Friends of\r\nBirmingham had collected for their \"mid-week\" assembly in a\r\nwheelwright-shop at Sconnel Town, a roadside group of shops and houses\r\nthat had disappeared entirely thirty years ago. Their usual place of\r\nworship, the low stone structure on the hills of Birmingham, three miles\r\nto the south, had been taken for a hospital for the sick of Washington's\r\narmy, and even on the previous First Day, as they gathered at ten\r\no'clock, they had found it being prepared for such a purpose, and had\r\ntaken their seats under the shade of the trees outside. The\r\nwheelwright-shop had therefore been selected as a temporary place of\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nAmong those gathered on this day was Joseph Townsend, a young man of\r\ntwenty-one, who has left us an interesting narrative of the day's\r\nevents. Much of the battle of Brandywine he saw. The day, he says, was\r\nexceedingly warm. It had been foggy in the morning, but later the mists\r\nhad dissipated--doubtless to the discontent of the husbandmen, for\r\nlittle rain had fallen for a long time except on the 26th of August--and\r\nnow the September sun was pouring down, so that in the hillside fields\r\nroundabout the ploughman, preparing his ground for winter wheat, rested\r\nhis sweating horses at the end of each furrow and wiped his own beaded\r\nface with the handkerchief from his hat. The upland pastures were brown;\r\ndust had settled on the forest foliage; the whole face of Nature was\r\nathirst; and the Brandywine, flowing from north to south half a mile\r\naway, was shrunken and narrow.\r\n\r\nAs the Friends sat in the shop, hats on heads, the elders and overseers\r\n\"facing the meeting,\" women on one side, men on the other, all on\r\nhastily-arranged benches of wheelwright planks, their silent serenity\r\nmust have been inwardly disturbed, for the spiritual ear surely heard\r\nwild voices of conflict in the air. The shock of a near battle was\r\nimpending; the very tread of the advancing invaders could almost be\r\nheard; already, indeed, as the Friends gathered in meeting, the fighting\r\nhad begun six miles down the creek, near the ford at John and Amos\r\nChad's.\r\n\r\nOn the preceding 20th of July--a Sunday--General David Forman, who had\r\nbeen patiently watching from the shores of New York Bay the embarkation\r\nof the British army upon the fleet of Lord Howe, and anxiously wondering\r\nfrom day to day whither the armada, with its eighteen thousand soldiers,\r\nwould sail, observed an increased activity amongst the ships. One\r\nhundred and sixty sail lay inside of Sandy Hook. Next morning fifteen\r\nmore came down from the city, and in the afternoon yet eighty\r\nmore--mostly small brigs, schooners and sloops--came out of the Narrows\r\nand joined the fleet, so that it numbered two hundred and fifty-five\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the wind favored their departure. At half-past six in the\r\nmorning the admiral's signal-gun was fired, and at seven they began to\r\nget under way. All day the vigilant Forman watched them as they passed\r\nout of the bay and moved down the Jersey coast. In three divisions they\r\nstretched away, steering mostly south-east, and moving like an immense\r\nflock of white waterfowl over the placid summer seas. He riding on shore\r\nas they sailed on the water, night found him at Shrewsbury, and thence,\r\nwith all speed, he sent couriers to General Washington and to the\r\nExecutive Council of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia. The council, in whose\r\narchives we find his despatch, at once sent another scout, Captain John\r\nHunn, to the Jersey coast to watch the hostile fleet. Setting off\r\npromptly, Hunn had reached the shore, near Little Egg Harbor, by two\r\no'clock of Friday, the 25th, and thence he rode slowly down to Cape May,\r\nnot seeing any of the ships, however, until the 30th, when, after three\r\ndays of \"thick\" weather, some of them came into the view of observers on\r\nboth capes of the Delaware. From the Delaware side, at ten in the\r\nmorning, that truculent Sussex Whig, Henry Fisher, had discerned two\r\nhundred and twenty-eight sail, and he sent off an express to ride with\r\nmight and main, up the forest roads by Dover and Cantwell's Bridge, to\r\nWilmington, and so to Philadelphia. Leaving the cape at ten in the\r\nmorning, the messenger reached Chester at a quarter before six in the\r\nafternoon, and thence hurried on.\r\n\r\nHunn, too, saw the ships from his post on Cape May, and only the need of\r\nbeing brief is reason for not giving here his quaint and badly-spelled\r\ndespatches, which, however, in spite of imperfect orthography,\r\nsufficiently told the movements of the fleet.\r\n\r\nJuly 31st the ships were still in the offing, but the next day not one\r\ncould be seen from the Delaware capes. Howe had sailed away for the\r\nampler waters of the Chesapeake, though the change of plan involved\r\nfurther delay on shipboard and exposure to the dangers of a greatly\r\nlengthened voyage. August 7th his ships were seen beating down the coast\r\ntoward Cape Charles, but, encountering adverse winds, it was some ten\r\ndays later before they were heard of inside the great bay.\r\n\r\nWashington had already moved from New Jersey, and on the 24th of August\r\nhe set forth from Philadelphia, riding at the head of his troops, who,\r\nas they marched through the streets, were decorated with sprays of green\r\nand watched by great crowds. With him rode the marquis de la Fayette,\r\nand other foreign officers of renown accompanied the march--Pulaski, the\r\ngallant Pole, the marquis de la Rouerie, and Louis de Fleury, a young\r\nand spirited compatriot of La Fayette, on duty with Stirling's division.\r\n\r\nPart of the army, including the division of General Stephen, had\r\npreceded the commander's march to Chester, and at that place General\r\nArmstrong had been for some days gathering the Pennsylvania militia.\r\nThere moved with Washington the remaining divisions of the army under\r\nSullivan, Stirling, Wayne and Greene, the artillery alone excepted.\r\nThis, General Nash was to place upon flatboats at Philadelphia, and so\r\nfloat down to Chester.\r\n\r\nBy the 26th the whole army was in and about Wilmington, then only a\r\nmodest town, the larger part gathered on one side along the Christiana,\r\nand the other clustered about the great mills upon the Brandywine, whose\r\ncorn-meal gave the place its chief repute. Washington fixed his\r\nhead-quarters in the mansion of one of the mill-owners (presumably\r\nJoseph Tatnall's spacious house), and the troops occupied the hills\r\naround, on which some traces of their lines of defence may still be\r\ndiscovered. The Delaware militia, urgently called upon by Congress, had\r\nbeen aroused, as far as possible, by the ever-faithful Rodney, the\r\nSigner of the Declaration--that tall, thin, odd-looking man, with a\r\ngreen patch covering the cancer that consumed his face--and they had\r\ntaken the field under the command of General Thomas Collins of Belmont\r\nHall in Kent, recently sheriff of that county, and afterward governor of\r\nthe State. Part of their duty had been an attempt to save from the\r\nenemy's hands the stores, including a large quantity of that precious\r\narticle, salt, which had been gathered at the \"Head of Elk.\"\r\n\r\nThe British had arrived. Their enormous fleet, proceeding slowly, had\r\nkept well together, and now lay anchored in Elk River, the greatest\r\ncompany by far that these quiet estuaries, the home of the wildfowl,\r\nfish and crab, had ever seen; and on the 25th the debarkation of the\r\ntroops began, Cornwallis's command landing first, and Knyphausen's,\r\nlocal chronicles say, not coming ashore until the 31st of the month. The\r\nlong voyage had been especially trying to the horses: those that\r\nsurvived were almost starved, and in no condition either to carry\r\ndragoons or drag cannon. General Howe issued a proclamation to the\r\npeople declaring that he came only to punish the rebellious, and making\r\nall due assurances to those disposed to maintain the royal authority.\r\nThey were informed they would be paid in gold and silver for all the\r\nhorses, cattle and produce they would bring in, and the Tories, we are\r\ntold, thereupon drove in some of the stock of their Whig neighbors.\r\nKnyphausen's men destroyed the county buildings of Cecil at Court-house\r\nPoint, and the public records were carried away, most of them being\r\nsubsequently recovered in New York. Several thousand bushels of oats and\r\ncorn were amongst the stores captured.\r\n\r\nHeavy rains fell on the 26th, the day after the debarkation began, and\r\nno forward movement of importance was made until the 27th, when\r\nCornwallis marched to Elkton (the Head of Elk), and thence issued the\r\nproclamation referred to. The next day his advance-guard occupied Gray's\r\nHill, two miles to the east.\r\n\r\nThe two armies therefore confronted each other at a distance of some\r\nfifteen to eighteen miles, and the unhappy people between sustained the\r\nusual penalties of such a situation. The American \"light-horse,\" part of\r\nwhich was the famous command of Harry Lee, scoured the country, annoying\r\nthe British outposts and capturing numbers of prisoners. On the 28th\r\nthey secured thirty or forty, and the next day twenty-nine were\r\nreported, besides twenty deserters who had come in, eight of them from\r\nthe fleet. General Collins, with his Delaware militia, hung upon the\r\nright flank of the British, commanded by Knyphausen, and preserved the\r\nlower section of New Castle county from being despoiled. Numerous\r\nskirmishes occurred, and amongst them one which, upon the scale of other\r\nRevolutionary encounters, almost rises to the dignity of a battle.\r\nShould we call it by that name, it was the only battle ever fought in\r\nDelaware during the struggle, unless we except some bloody local fights\r\nbetween the Whigs and the Tories of Sussex. This affair took place on\r\nthe 3d of September. The British were then advancing slowly eastward,\r\nand their vanguard, composed of German yagers, supported by light\r\ninfantry, encountered at Cooch's Bridge, a crossing of the White Clay\r\nCreek, the riflemen of Maxwell and some of the Delaware militia.\r\nMaxwell's men, posted thinly and under cover, poured a deadly fire into\r\nthe British ranks as they advanced, but were presently forced back by\r\ntheir superior numbers across the stream. The Americans admitted a loss\r\nof forty killed and wounded, and while the casualties on the other side\r\nwere not known, a woman who came the next day from the British camp\r\ndeclared she had seen nine wagonloads of wounded brought in.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the American commanders had been choosing a position in which\r\nto meet the advance of the enemy. During the rains of the 26th,\r\nWashington himself rode down nearly to the British front, and Greene and\r\nWeeden, reconnoitring carefully, had selected the high ground of Iron\r\nHill, near the British lines on Gray's Hill, as a strong position. A\r\ncouncil of general officers, however, decided against this location,\r\nchoosing instead an advance of five or six miles out of Wilmington to\r\nthe east side of Red Clay Creek. To the position thus chosen on\r\nSeptember 5th the whole army moved, except a brigade under General\r\nIrwin, which was left to occupy the defensive works around Wilmington.\r\nOn the Red Clay the line extended from near the confluence of that\r\nstream with the Christiana on the left up to Hockessin on the right.\r\nGreene disapproved altogether of the position. He pointed out that it\r\ndid not cover Philadelphia, and that it would be easily turned by the\r\nmarch of Howe northward into Pennsylvania--exactly what subsequently\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThree days after the line of the Red Clay had been occupied, the\r\nBritish, having bought and seized horses enough to serve their pressing\r\nneeds, began their forward movement. Their tents and heavy baggage, the\r\nlast to be disembarked, had now been landed, and the rear, under General\r\nGrant, was ready to follow the onward march. On the 8th, therefore,\r\nCornwallis extended his left flank well up into the country above\r\nNewark, far outreaching the American lines, while a strong column of the\r\nright wing threatened the American front, moving directly toward it as\r\nfar as Milltown, only two miles away. This manoeuvre developed the\r\nuntenable character of the Red Clay line, and Washington hastened to\r\nextricate himself. On the night of the 8th he broke camp and marched\r\nrapidly northward. At two o'clock on the morning of the 9th he crossed\r\nthe Brandywine at Chad's Ford, and posted his army on the high\r\nhill-slopes east of the creek, directly in Howe's path toward\r\nPhiladelphia. The British commander, disappointed and chagrined when he\r\nperceived at daylight the escape of the Americans, moved also, and on\r\nthe evening of September 10th united his two columns at Kennet Square,\r\ndirectly west some seven miles, by a well-used road, from Washington's\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe Brandywine Valley, near the battle-ground, then, as now, teemed with\r\nagricultural wealth. The fine farms of the thrifty English settlers,\r\nmany of whom traced their ownership back in a family line of\r\nthree-quarters of a century, spread out along the creek in fine meadows\r\nof natural \"green grass,\" and rolled upward over the hill-slopes, which,\r\nthough broken and irregular, nowhere rise precipitously or to great\r\nheight. The invading forces, as they marched up from the Chesapeake,\r\ncould not but see the richness of the region, and one of their officers,\r\nconversed with by Joseph Townsend, exclaimed \"in some rapture,\" Joseph\r\nsays, \"You have got a hell of a fine country here; which we have found\r\nto be the case ever since we landed at the Head of Elk.\"\r\n\r\nAlong the hill-slopes, on the east side of the Brandywine, from Chad's\r\nFord up to Brinton's, a distance of about three miles, the Americans lay\r\non the night of September 10th. Wayne was posted to guard the lower\r\nford, and Sullivan had his own division and those of Stirling and\r\nStephen stretched up along the stream. Greene's division formed the\r\nreserve. Sullivan's duties included the guarding of the fords above\r\nBrinton's, and he had become possessed of the unfortunate idea that\r\nthere were but three of these fordable, and that beyond the three in\r\nquestion there was no place for a distance of twelve miles where the\r\nhostile army could cross. He therefore sent detachments on this evening\r\nof the 10th to the three fords--the Delaware regiment to Jones's, and\r\nbattalions of Hazen's regiment to Wistar's and Buffington's. With this\r\nhe rested content. It is, however, true that the cavalry at his command\r\nseems to have been pitifully meagre: he asserts that on the morning of\r\nthe battle he had _four_ light-horsemen only, two of whom he sent on\r\nscouting duty, retaining the other two to serve as couriers to\r\nhead-quarters.\r\n\r\nBelow the line of Washington's main army, at Pyle's Ford, were posted\r\nthe Pennsylvania militia under General Armstrong, and below their\r\nposition the Brandywine enters rocky hills, flowing between steep banks\r\nthat forbid the easy passage of an army.\r\n\r\nWashington slept on this night at Benjamin Ring's, just east of Chad's\r\nFord, and La Fayette at Gideon Gilpin's, near by. Both the dwellings are\r\nstill standing and occupied as places of residence. To defend the\r\ncrossing at the ford a battery of six guns was planted in front of John\r\nChad's house. Its location may yet be distinctly traced. West of the\r\nstream, Maxwell's riflemen were posted well out on the road toward\r\nKennet Square, where General Howe occupied Wiley's tavern, an ancient\r\nhostelry, as his quarters. He had formed his plan of attack--to engage\r\nthe attention of the Americans by a sharp attack on the road to the\r\ncrossing at Chad's with Knyphausen's division of five thousand men,\r\nwhile Cornwallis should proceed, upon roads concealed from the American\r\nview by distance and intervening forests, far up the creek to the fords\r\nthat Sullivan had not guarded, and, crossing there, descend with\r\ncrushing force upon the American line. Sullivan himself declared, in\r\nletters written after the battle, that he had anticipated such an\r\nattack: it was the natural plan of battle for Howe to adopt under the\r\ncircumstances. If, then, our general had only taken sufficient\r\nprecaution to meet it!\r\n\r\nEarly on this foggy, warm morning of the 11th the British were in\r\nmotion. There was no hurry for Knyphausen, but Cornwallis's men had a\r\nlong, hard march before them. At five o'clock they set off, leaving\r\nbehind them all encumbering baggage, even their knapsacks. Turning\r\nnorthward, they took the road which, pursuing a direction generally\r\nparallel with the Brandywine, reaches the west branch of the creek at\r\nTrimble's Ford. Howe himself rode with them. He was mounted, Townsend\r\nsays, \"on a large English horse, much reduced in flesh\"--thanks to short\r\nrations on shipboard. Thirteen thousand men, the whole left wing of the\r\narmy, marched in this column. Hidden by the forests and hills, as well\r\nas by the mists of the morning, they had moved several miles on their\r\nway before any word of their march reached the Americans across the\r\ncreek, only three miles away.\r\n\r\nCornwallis having gone, Knyphausen presently took up his share of the\r\nmorning's work. At nine o'clock, or thereabout, he pressed forward on\r\nthe road toward Chad's. The opposing force between him and that place\r\nwas mainly Maxwell's command of riflemen and light infantry, whose main\r\nbody, about a thousand strong, lay upon the high ground a mile west of\r\nthe ford, but whose scouting-parties the British advance-guard speedily\r\nencountered. A party of scouts, indeed, tradition says, had ventured to\r\nJohnny Welsh's tavern, almost in the very embraces of Knyphausen, and\r\nthere, in cheerful disregard of precaution, had tied their horses in\r\nfront, and were making merry with the apple whiskey and New England rum\r\nof the bar-room. Surprised thus, the patriot bacchanals ran for their\r\nlives from the back door and escaped through the fields, emptying their\r\nguns in one sputtering volley that wounded one of their own horses left\r\nin the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nA little farther, however, the riflemen began to fire upon the advancing\r\nBritish, though, pressed by the heavy column, they fell slowly back\r\ntoward Maxwell's main body. From behind the clumps of trees, the hedges,\r\nthe walls and the houses they aimed at the invaders, and harassed, if\r\nthey did not impede, their march. The \"Old Kennet\" meeting-house and its\r\ngraveyard walls gave them another and yet more favorable ambush. But by\r\nten o'clock the fighting had become more serious. Maxwell, pressed by a\r\ngreatly superior force, resisted stoutly, and the firing on both sides\r\nwas heavy. Proctor's artillery pounded away across the stream. The\r\nriflemen, well under cover, at first threw Knyphausen's men into\r\nconfusion, though they included some of the best regiments of the\r\nBritish army, the Fourth, Fifth, Twenty-eighth, Forty-ninth and\r\nSeventy-first being among them.\r\n\r\nAs Proctor trained his guns upon the advancing British, the house of\r\nWilliam Harvey (Senior--his son William, Junior, lived east of the\r\ncreek) was directly in the line of fire. William, who was a quiet but\r\nfirm old Friend, was at his home, intending to protect his goods if\r\npossible, though he had sent his family away. His neighbor, Jacob Way,\r\nfound him at this juncture sitting on his front piazza, which ended to\r\nthe eastward against his kitchen, a semi-detached building. \"Come away!\"\r\nsaid Jacob: \"thee is in danger here. Thee will surely be killed.\" But\r\nWilliam refused. Jacob expostulated. As they exchanged words, a\r\ntwelve-pound cannon-ball came from Proctor's battery directly for the\r\nhouse, passed through both walls of the kitchen, and plunged along the\r\npiazza floor, tearing up the boards and barely avoiding William's legs,\r\nuntil, a little farther on, it buried itself six feet deep in the earth.\r\nIt is recorded that William hesitated no longer, but sought a safer\r\nplace. His house was thoroughly despoiled when the British came up.\r\n\r\nKnyphausen, however, steadily pressed the Americans back, forced them\r\nfrom the high ground down to the edge of the creek, and finally drove\r\nthem across. By half-past ten o'clock this was accomplished, and the\r\nBritish line was then formed half a mile back from the stream, where it\r\nlay until half-past four in the afternoon, the artillery keeping up a\r\nthreatening but not serious fire upon Wayne's position on the east side,\r\nwhich his batteries returned. On the whole, the Americans thought\r\nthemselves doing fairly well. Washington's secretary sent off a despatch\r\nto Congress saying that the British loss must be three hundred killed\r\nand wounded, \"while ours does not exceed fifty altogether.\"\r\n\r\nPart of the British force at the ford on this morning was a rifle corps\r\ncommanded by Major Patrick Ferguson, a young Scotchman recently arrived\r\nin America, and subsequently killed in the sanguinary fight on King's\r\nMountain. In a letter describing the Brandywine battle he says his men\r\nwere lying concealed in a skirt of woods when \"a rebel officer in a\r\nhuzzar dress\" passed in front, followed by another in dark green and\r\nblue \"mounted on a good bay horse and wearing a remarkably high cocked\r\nhat.\" Ferguson ordered three men to steal near and fire upon them, but\r\nbelieving that they would surely be killed, so near were they riding, he\r\nfelt the act to be murder and recalled his men. Again, having first\r\npassed to some distance, the officer on the bay horse returned, and rode\r\nwithin easy shooting distance, but Ferguson again restrained himself.\r\nThe next day he learned from wounded Americans who fell into the hands\r\nof the British \"that General Washington was all the morning with the\r\nlight troops, and attended only by a French officer in a huzzar dress,\r\nhe himself mounted and dressed in every respect as above described.\"\r\n\r\nThe Friends whom we left gathered in the wheelwright-shop adjourned with\r\nsome agitation. \"While we were sitting therein,\" Joseph Townsend says,\r\n\"some disturbance was discovered near the house and about the door,\r\nwhich occasioned some individuals to go out to know the cause, and they\r\nnot returning and the uneasiness not subsiding, suspicions arose that\r\nsomething serious was taking place: the meeting accordingly closed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed quite time that the heads of the meeting had shaken hands\r\nas the signal for adjourning. The \"uneasiness\" outside had good reason.\r\nThe cry was that the red-coats were coming. Women were weeping and\r\ncrying that \"they murdered all before them, young and old.\" The men\r\nendeavored to allay their fears, and urged them to be more composed; but\r\nwhile this took place \"our eyes were caught, on a sudden, by the\r\nappearance of the army coming out of the woods into the fields belonging\r\nto Emmor Jefferis, on the west side of the creek, above the\r\nfording-place. In a few minutes the fields were literally covered over\r\nwith them, and they were hastening toward us. Their arms and bayonets,\r\nbeing raised, shone bright as silver, there being a clear sky and the\r\nday exceedingly warm.\"\r\n\r\nHowe and Cornwallis, making their long détour, since five in the morning\r\nhad crossed the western branch at Trimble's Ford, and were here now, at\r\nthe undefended crossing of the eastern branch, ready to sweep down upon\r\nthe American line. Emmor Jefferis, who lived at the ford in a\r\nsubstantial house, was surprised at such an arrival of visitors. There\r\nlay in his ample cellar great store of wines and other liquors, silks,\r\ncloths, etc., the most valuable goods of some of the merchants down at\r\nWilmington, which they had hauled up to this point when they considered\r\ntheir own town threatened. As the British pressed their company upon\r\nEmmor with great unreserve, they speedily found the prize in the cellar.\r\nThe casks were rolled out, the heads knocked in, and the officers,\r\nquaffing the old madeira, drank to its rebel owners, whose chagrin may\r\nbe imagined when they heard of its fate.\r\n\r\nTo cross the creek, General Howe ordered Jefferis to act as guide and\r\nfurther to direct them down the roads toward the American position.\r\nEmmor obeyed with great hesitancy, and later, when the battle was on and\r\na bullet flew uncomfortably near, he flinched so perceptibly that Howe\r\nfelt called on to say, \"Don't be afraid, Mr. Jefferis: they won't hurt\r\nyou.\" Notwithstanding which assurance, Emmor still was not happy.\r\n\r\nThe hour of crossing must have been near noon or a little after. They\r\nturned down the road toward Birmingham as they reached the east side,\r\nand soon the head of the column passed through Sconnel's, by the\r\nmeeting-house so lately vacated. \"The space occupied by the main body\r\nand flanking-parties was near a half mile wide.\" Sarah Boake, the wife\r\nof Abel, whose house stood near, called to Joseph Townsend and his\r\nbrother William--who since meeting closed had gone home to secure their\r\nhorses in the stable, but had now returned--to see what fine fellows\r\nthese were. \"They're something like an army!\" cried she. As the column\r\npassed \"one of the most eligible houses\" in the little cluster at\r\nSconnel, \"divers of the principal officers\" entered and soon \"manifested\r\nan uncommon social disposition,\" being full of inquiries where the\r\nrebels now were, and especially where Mr. Washington was to be found. To\r\nthis William Townsend answered that he thought if they would have\r\npatience they would presently meet with Mr. Washington, as he and his\r\nmen were not far distant--a dry joke that does great credit, under the\r\ncircumstances, to Quaker William. Moreover, as they plied the young men\r\nwith further inquiries, William said he had seen the commander down at\r\nhis quarters at Chad's the day before, and described him as \"a stately,\r\nwell-proportioned, fine-looking man, of great ability, active, firm and\r\nresolute, of a social disposition, and considered to be a good man.\"\r\nThis was observed, Joseph says, \"to check their ardor for a sight of\r\nhim,\" though one rejoined that \"he might be a good man, but he was most\r\ndamnably misled to take up arms against his sovereign.\" As they sat thus\r\ntalking, Cornwallis passed the house. He appeared tall and sat very\r\nerect, wearing his scarlet uniform, richly trimmed with gold lace and\r\nheavy epaulets. Most of the officers, our narrator says, \"were rather\r\nshort, portly men, well dressed and of genteel appearance, and did not\r\nlook as if they had ever been exposed to any hardship, their skins being\r\nas white and delicate as is customary for females brought up in large\r\ncities or towns.\" A halt of the advance-guard had been made a few\r\nminutes in the village while the horses were fed on some patches of\r\ngrowing corn. These troops were Germans, \"and many of them,\" Townsend\r\nremarks, \"wore their beards on their upper lips, which was a novelty in\r\nthat part of the country.\"\r\n\r\nBy two o'clock, or somewhat earlier, the British had reached Osborne's\r\nHill, from which they had a good view to the south and east. The high\r\nground around Birmingham meeting-house, on which a little later the\r\nhurrying Americans would appear, was plainly in view. Cornwallis's men\r\nhad now marched since morning about thirteen miles under the burning\r\nsun, wading the two branches of the Brandywine. They were halted here,\r\ntook out their dinner-rations and ate them, and about three o'clock were\r\nrested and ready to fight.\r\n\r\nAll the fore part of the day Washington had been near the crossing at\r\nChad's, watching the encounter there. It must have been nearly noon when\r\nhe received intelligence of a startling character. Colonel Bland had\r\nbeen across the creek (the main stream below its \"forks\"), and now sent\r\nword that he had observed at a distance the march north of a large body\r\nof the enemy. Two brigades he had distinctly seen, \"and the dust\r\nappeared to rise in their rear for a considerable distance.\" While this\r\ndespatch was in Washington's hand came another from Colonel Ross, who\r\nhad ridden to a point on \"the Great Valley road,\" in the rear of Howe's\r\ncolumn, and sent word confirming Bland's observations. He estimated the\r\nmoving force at not less than five thousand.\r\n\r\nWith such intelligence of Howe's strategy, Washington promptly resolved\r\nupon a bold and vigorous counter-movement--not hastily, we may presume,\r\nfor he had doubtless anticipated the contingency and formed the plan in\r\nanticipation of such an attempt to outflank him. He now gave orders to\r\nhis division commanders--Sullivan on the right, Greene in the centre and\r\nWayne on the left--to prepare for an immediate offensive movement\r\nagainst Knyphausen, designing to cross the creek, crush him and capture\r\nhis baggage before Howe could counter-march and come to his relief.\r\nSullivan says he received orders to cross and attack the enemy's left,\r\nwhile the rest of the army crossed below (at Chad's) and engaged his\r\nright. \"This I was preparing to do when Major Spear, a militia officer,\r\nrode hastily in. He informed me that he was from the upper country, that\r\nhe had come in the road where the enemy must have passed to attack our\r\nright, and that there was not the least appearance of them in that\r\nquarter.\" He added that he had been sent to reconnoitre by General\r\nWashington. Sullivan now hesitated: he could not omit to forward such\r\nintelligence. It contradicted certainly what Colonel Bland and Colonel\r\nRoss had sent, but it was possible that Cornwallis had moved northward\r\nonly as a feint, and had returned to the support of Knyphausen; so that\r\nif the Americans should now cross, they would encounter not merely the\r\nBritish right, but their whole army--not five thousand men, but eighteen\r\nthousand. Sullivan therefore sat down, took Spear's statement word for\r\nword \"from his own mouth,\" and forwarded it to Washington, sending Spear\r\nhimself after the messenger to report verbally. \"I made no comment and\r\ngave no opinion,\" says Sullivan. Upon the heels of Spear came another\r\nkeen-eyed scout who had not seen the British. This was \"Sergeant Tucker\r\nof the Light Horse.\" He confirmed Spear's story. Washington now recalled\r\nhis orders and abandoned the intended attack on Knyphausen.\r\n\r\nOn the hill-slope south of the present road which crosses the Brandywine\r\nat Chad's, Washington was resting under the shade of a cherry tree\r\n(which fell in a storm a few years ago), when, about half-past one\r\no'clock, there came riding across the hillside fields from above,\r\navoiding the circuitous roads, Squire Thomas Cheyney, his hat gone, his\r\nblack hair streaming in the wind and his black eyes blazing with\r\nexcitement. The blooded mare he rode, trained to fox-hunting, carried\r\nhis two hundred pounds easily, and cleared ditches, fences and hedges.\r\nCheyney had been near the upper fords, and had suddenly come upon the\r\nBritish as they moved down toward Osborne's Hill. They fired upon him as\r\nhe wheeled and galloped off, but he escaped unhurt. Reporting to\r\nSullivan, that officer received him discourteously, the chroniclers say;\r\nas not improbably he might, for the contradictory reports as to the\r\nBritish movement were, upon a subject so terribly momentous,\r\nexasperating enough. But as Sullivan hesitated, Cheyney demanded to see\r\nWashington himself, and was accordingly sent to him. Washington ordered\r\nhim to dismount. \"Now,\" said he, \"draw me a sketch of the upper roads.\r\nWhere did the British cross? and where are they now?\"\r\n\r\nCheyney alighted and made the plan. Washington seemed to hesitate, as if\r\ndoubting the information. The ardent squire, in the intensity of the\r\nmoment, cried, \"Take my life, general, if I deceive you!\"\r\n\r\nIf the commander doubted, however, there came on the instant further\r\nword. Colonel Bland had sent another despatch to Sullivan, dated at \"a\r\nquarter-past one o'clock,\" and saying that the enemy were then arriving\r\nin great force on Osborne's Hill, a little to the right of Birmingham\r\nmeeting-house. This despatch Sullivan sent instantly to Washington, and\r\nthe word Cheyney had brought was now made sure beyond peradventure.\r\n\r\nBland's confirmation of Cheyney's news aroused the injudicious but brave\r\ncommander of the right wing, and he moved his troops at once up toward\r\nBirmingham. His immediate command, he says in one of the several\r\ndefensive letters written after the battle, marched a mile from the\r\nposition it occupied to that in which it met the enemy. On a hill just\r\nwest of the meeting-house, from which, as they looked north-west, they\r\ncould see the British on Osborne's Hill, they made their line of battle,\r\nand Cornwallis, as he sat upon his horse watching them through his\r\nglass, cried out with a round army oath, \"The damned rebels form well!\"\r\n\r\nIn what order the American line was formed we know. The division of\r\nStephen occupied the right, that of Stirling the centre, that of\r\nSullivan the left. But many of the details are vaguely and\r\ncontradictorily stated. Lossing, following the sketch of the battle in\r\nthe Pennsylvania Historical Society's collections, describes Sullivan's\r\ncircuitous march to outreach Deborre, both seeking to obtain the right\r\nof the line, while Bancroft says that Sullivan posted his division in\r\nadvance of the extreme left, detached by a half-mile gap from the rest\r\nof the line, but that, on being remonstrated with, he moved to close up\r\nthe space, and was attacked before he had again formed his line of\r\nbattle. What followed, however, is distinct enough. Rested and fed, the\r\nroyal army precipitated itself, three to one in strength, and equally\r\ndisproportionate in discipline and experience, upon the unready line of\r\nthe Americans. The German and British troops, we are told, \"vied with\r\neach other in fury\" as they ran forward in a superb and irresistible\r\nbayonet charge. The struggle began about four o'clock: it lasted perhaps\r\nhalf an hour. As the enemy advanced they were fired upon by a body of\r\noutposted riflemen in an orchard near the road on which the attacking\r\ncolumn moved; whereupon, says Joseph Townsend, who was near by watching\r\nthe movement, the Hessians ran up the bank by the roadside, and,\r\nlevelling their guns through the fence, returned the fire.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed by the attack, the Americans broke on the right. This was\r\nthe post of honor which Deborre, an old French officer, had obtained for\r\nhis brigade. Conway, in a letter written a few weeks later to support\r\nSullivan's defence, says the latter, though entitled to the right, took\r\nthe left in order to save time, and that Deborre, though the ground was\r\nmuch more favorable for the quick formation of his line, was not in\r\norder when the enemy attacked. It is agreed that Deborre's brigade broke\r\nfirst, and that then the left, Sullivan's men, gave way, though Sullivan\r\nstruggled bravely to hold them. \"I saw him,\" says De Fleury, \"rallying\r\nhis men with great ardor,\" but unsuccessfully; and he then came to\r\nStirling's division, which was fighting on the hill, braving the thick\r\nof the fire until the centre too gave way, when, at the last, he was\r\nstriving to rally the fugitives and encourage them to form a new line\r\nbehind the fences. Had Sullivan shown vigilance and discretion equal to\r\nhis courage, the day's history might have been totally different.\r\n\r\nThirty minutes completed this epoch of the battle. The first line was\r\ndestroyed. Those who had formed it were stretched on the sere pastures\r\nor hurrying to the rear. Stirling and Conway, as well as Sullivan, had\r\nshown great bravery and coolness, but the resistance, practically, had\r\nbeen totally ineffective. The beaten and demoralized troops streamed\r\ninto the woods, and sought shelter or escape until they met the\r\nreinforcements under Greene.\r\n\r\nAs the sound of Sullivan's encounter reached him--possibly\r\nsooner--Greene had moved from his reserve position to the support of the\r\nright flank. He marched, it is asserted, four miles in forty minutes.\r\nWashington himself left Chad's Ford, giving the command there to Wayne,\r\nand hurried off to the more perilous quarter of the field. Joseph Brown,\r\na resident of the vicinity, was impressed as a guide. He was hurriedly\r\nmounted on a fine charger belonging to a staff officer, and Washington\r\nbade him ride with all speed in the direction of the firing. Away they\r\nwent, Joseph's horse clearing fences and ditches gallantly, the\r\ncommander at his flank urging him on. \"Push along, old man! push along,\r\nold man!\" was his repeated command, remembered and related for many\r\nyears after by Joseph. They rode, he said, to a point between\r\nDilworthtown and the meeting-house, half a mile away from the former\r\nplace, and here the sounds of the battle seemed close at hand. Bullets\r\nflew thick, the general and his staff turned their attention from the\r\nguide, and he, glad to be excused, slipped from his saddle and withdrew.\r\n\r\nPrecisely when and where Greene met the fugitives from the first rout is\r\nanother of the uncertainties. The best descriptions of the battle, upon\r\nbeing compared carefully, will be found vague and to some degree\r\nconflicting. But there are two points on the road from the meeting-house\r\nto Dilworth, marked upon the military map of the field as the \"Second\r\nPosition,\" where Greene undoubtedly posted his men. These positions are\r\nnear together: one is south of the road, half a mile east of the\r\nmeeting-house, on a hill-slope descending toward the west; and the other\r\nis north of the road, at a ravine now known as Sandy Hollow.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Greene opened his lines, received the fugitives from the\r\nfront, and re-formed. Possibly this took place at this second position.\r\nIt is certain that here the British advance was sharply checked, and\r\nthe Americans stubbornly held their ground until late in the afternoon.\r\nIt was at this turn in the battle that La Fayette was wounded, and not\r\nin the first encounter, as the current historical narrative would give\r\nus to understand. A survey of the map ascertains very precisely the\r\nplace where he was shot, according to abundant testimony, and this is\r\nmore than a mile distant from Sullivan's lines. It is very unlikely that\r\nLa Fayette was in the first encounter, beyond the meeting-house. He\r\nprobably arrived on the field with Washington, or he may possibly have\r\naccompanied Greene. The place where he was wounded is a field about\r\nhalfway from the meeting-house to Dilworth, south-west of the road and\r\nabout a hundred rods away. Trustworthy accounts say he was with\r\nWashington at the time, both engaged in rallying the troops; and this is\r\nquite likely: the place is only a little distance westward from the\r\npoint to which Joseph Brown guided the general. In July, 1825, when La\r\nFayette revisited the ground, he drove up from Wilmington in a carriage\r\nwith the Messrs. Du Pont, whom he had been visiting. Great crowds\r\naccompanied him over the historic field, and as he drove along the road\r\nnear the place already described, the carriage was stopped and the\r\ngallant old gentleman rose to his feet to point out the position in\r\nwhich he sustained his wound. \"It was,\" he said, \"somewhere on yonder\r\nslope. The exact spot I cannot now tell.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The precise nature of La Fayette's wound is differently\r\nstated in the chronicles. It was a gun-shot injury in his left leg, and\r\ndid not immediately disable him. He rode that night to Chester, and\r\nthence reached Bristol, from which place Henry Laurens took him to the\r\ngentle nursing of the Moravian Sisters at Bethlehem. He remained there\r\ntwo months before he rejoined the army.]\r\n\r\nBaffled as Howe was by the stubborn resistance after Greene arrived,\r\nthis check was almost the only American triumph in the day's contest.\r\nThere was hard fighting from five o'clock until dusk. Posted in strong\r\npositions, well supported by the artillery, commanded by Washington\r\nhimself, the patriot troops displayed their most soldierly qualities.\r\nThe brigades of Muhlenberg, the Episcopal rector, and of Weeden, the\r\nVirginia innkeeper, stood well and fought bravely. History preserves\r\nespecially the names of three regiments as earning distinction--one from\r\nPennsylvania, under Colonel Stewart; and two from Virginia--the Tenth,\r\nunder Colonel Stevens, and the Third, commanded by John Marshall,\r\nafterward chief-justice of the United States. The Marylanders, under\r\nSmallwood, and the Delaware regiment, acquitted themselves with probably\r\nequal credit. Amongst the officers, Sullivan, Stirling and Conway had\r\nbeen conspicuous for courage; La Fayette was wounded; De Fleury had his\r\nhorse shot under him (Congress soon voted him another); Pulaski had\r\nrendered gallant service, earning early promotion; the marquis de la\r\nRouerie was a prisoner.\r\n\r\nBut though resisting so well, the effect was only to cover the needful\r\nretreat. Down at Chad's Ford the conflict had been quickly over after\r\nthe fighting began at Birmingham. The sound of the guns from the hills\r\nset Knyphausen in motion in earnest after all his feints and pretences\r\nsince morning. He pressed forward to cross the creek. Wayne fought him\r\nwell a little while, Proctor's artillery raking the advancing Hessians\r\nas they waded the stream until its placid waters ran crimson with their\r\nblood. But while Knyphausen's column was itself too heavy for Wayne to\r\noppose successfully, the catastrophe at Birmingham followed so quickly\r\nupon the beginning of the struggle there that the contest at the ford\r\nwas soon ended. Howe was rapidly gaining his rear when Wayne learned of\r\nSullivan's disaster, and there was now only one resource--to retreat\r\nwith all speed. Proctor's guns and other munitions were abandoned, and\r\nthe fragments of the left wing, like those of the right, went drifting\r\ntoward the Delaware.\r\n\r\nAs the friendly shades of night came down the British were pressing the\r\nfugitive army off the field, though not with a hot pursuit. In the\r\nWilmington road, below Dilworthtown, at dusk, we have a view of\r\nWashington riding hastily along and ordering the officers whom he met to\r\ngather up the disorganized troops and hurry toward Chester. As the night\r\nhid the retreat, the stars came out to shine upon the dead, the dying\r\nand the wounded. Howe estimated the American loss at three hundred\r\nkilled, six hundred wounded and four hundred prisoners--figures which\r\nGreene's report did not essentially contradict. The wounded were mostly\r\nin Howe's hands: few had escaped, as one did in a \"chair\" hurriedly\r\ndriven over to the Black Horse tavern, on the road to Chester, by Robert\r\nMendinhall, a neighboring Quaker farmer. The British loss was reported\r\nas five hundred and seventy-eight killed and wounded, including\r\nfifty-eight officers. Even if these figures were too low, the day's\r\ncasualties aggregated fifteen hundred. The little meeting-house was\r\nfilled with the badly wounded, and Howe sent word to Washington that\r\nmore surgeons were needed, in response to which message several were\r\nsent to the field. The dead, as usual, were hastily buried, and heavy\r\nrains after the battle washed out many of the shallow pits, exposing\r\ntheir ghastly occupants to the elements and prowling beasts. The\r\nneighboring people were compelled to undertake the work of re-interment,\r\nin which, Joseph Townsend says, \"it would be difficult to describe the\r\nmany cases of horror and destruction of human beings\" that they\r\nencountered. The battle was over, the tide of war had swept past, but\r\nthese horrid evidences of its slaughter remained as the memorials of the\r\nstruggle by which, for a time, the British had captured Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n                                              HOWARD M. JENKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREAT DAY.\r\n\r\nFROM THE ITALIAN OF EDMONDO DE AMICIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe G---- family were at their villa, a few miles out of Florence, when\r\nthe Italian army was preparing to march on Rome. The enterprise was not\r\nfavorably regarded by them. The father, the mother and the two grown-up\r\ndaughters, ardent Catholics and mild patriots, desired \"moral measures.\"\r\n\"We do not understand politics,\" said Madame G---- to her friends, \"and\r\nI least of all; and if I had to tell you quite clearly and distinctly\r\nwhy I think as I do, I should be puzzled. But what can I do? I have a\r\npresentiment; I hear a voice within me; I feel a thrill--something which\r\ntells me they must not go, they ought not to go, they cannot go, to Rome\r\nin such a manner. I remember '48; I remember '59; I remember '60. Well,\r\nin those days I had no fear; I never felt at heart the anxiety that I\r\nhave now: I always thought things would come right. But this time, my\r\nfriends, there is no use in talking, I see trouble in the air, and a\r\ngreat deal of it. You smile. Pray to Heaven that some day or other you\r\nmay not have cause to weep. That day does not seem to me far off.\"\r\n\r\nThe only one of the whole family who did not think thus was the son, a\r\nyoung man of twenty, who was just now reading Roman history, and was in\r\na state of ferment. The mere mention of Rome in his presence was the\r\nsignal for a battle: there had already been one of the liveliest kind,\r\nand it was agreed never to broach the subject again.\r\n\r\nOne evening early in September they received an official journal in\r\nwhich the news was authoritatively announced that the Italian soldiers\r\nhad passed the frontier. The young man leapt for joy. The father read\r\nthe article, remained thoughtful for some time, and then, shaking his\r\nhead, muttered, \"No!\" and again, \"No!\" and a third time, \"No, no, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"But excuse me, papa,\" exclaimed the son, firing up.\r\n\r\n\"There! there!\" interrupted the mother tenderly.\r\n\r\nAnd during the rest of the evening no more was said about it. But\r\nserious trouble occurred the following evening, when, shortly before\r\ngoing to bed, the young man frankly and without preamble, as if he were\r\ndoing the most natural thing in the world, announced his intention of\r\ngoing to Rome with the army.\r\n\r\nThere was a general cry of surprise and indignation, followed by a\r\ntempest of reproaches and threats. \"It was not a thing one could\r\nhonorably desire to see; already part of the guilt attached to each of\r\nthem as an Italian, without having to add the responsibility of being an\r\neye-witness; and this, that and the other; and, in fine, that anything\r\nmight be conceded or pardoned in a well-born young man except the\r\nmadness of going to see\" (these were the mother's words) \"_a poor old\r\nman bombarded_. A fine war! Fine glory, indeed!\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished the young man gnashed his teeth, tore the journal\r\nto pieces, jumped up from his seat, lighted a lamp and went to shut\r\nhimself up in his room, stamping his feet like an Italian actor playing\r\nthe part of a furious king.\r\n\r\nBut in half an hour softly, softly, on tiptoe, he returned to the\r\ndining-room. There was no one there but the father and mother, silent\r\nand sad. He asked pardon of his father, who growled, but suffered him to\r\npress his hand, and then returned to his room, followed by his mother.\r\n\"Now we shall have no more of such ideas, shall we?\" she said to him\r\ntenderly, laying her hands on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe son answered with a kiss.\r\n\r\nThe next day he crossed the frontier of the Pontifical States.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they became aware of it at home there were tears, outbursts,\r\ninvectives, suggestions of never receiving him again, of not even\r\nrising from their seats when he returned, of allowing a month to pass\r\nwithout addressing a word to him, of striking out the item\r\n\"pocket-money\" from the family budget, and a hundred other things. On\r\nthe mother's part these were words, but on the father's serious\r\nintentions. He was not a man to waver; he was good, but stern, and at\r\ntimes, when he was angry, even terrible: his son knew this, and feared\r\nhim. How he had ever been able, therefore, to offer him such an outrage\r\nwas inexplicable. The accounts of the 20th of September only served to\r\nembitter the parents more. \"He shall feel it,\" said they between their\r\nteeth. \"Let him come!\" Their words, their gestures, their plan of\r\naction, had all been thought over and prepared. It would be a severe\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 22d they were all seated at table when suddenly a\r\nloud knock was heard at the door, and immediately after the son\r\nappeared, red in the face, out of breath, bronzed by the sun, standing\r\nerect and motionless on the threshold. No one moved.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the young man, folding his arms with an air of\r\nastonishment, \"you do not know the news?\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been told nothing? Has no one been here from Florence? Are you\r\nstill in the dark about everything?\"\r\n\r\nNo one breathed.\r\n\r\n\"The taking of Rome,\" one of the girls ventured to say presently, after\r\nhaving consulted her papa with a glance--\"we know of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what a taking of Rome!\" burst out the young man with a cry that\r\nmade them all tremble--\"what a taking of Rome! Then I bring you the\r\naccount of it.\"\r\n\r\nThey all rose and gathered around him.\r\n\r\n\"But how is it possible,\" he went on crying, waving his hands--\"how is\r\nit possible that you know nothing of it? Has not the news spread through\r\nthe country? Have not the country-people assembled? What is the city\r\ngovernment doing? Listen, then--listen; seat yourselves around me; I\r\nwill relate all to you. My heart beats so that I can hardly speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing: I will tell you nothing. I wish to relate everything in order:\r\ngive me breathing-time. I wish you to hear the facts one by one as I saw\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mean the Roman feasts?\"\r\n\r\n\"The plébiscite?\"\r\n\r\n\"The arrival of the king?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, no: something quite different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But sit down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how is it that we have heard nothing about it here?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell? All I know is, that to be the first who brings you this\r\nnews is the greatest pleasure I have experienced in my whole life. I\r\narrived this morning at Florence: they knew all about it. I left\r\nimmediately. Who knows? thought I, perhaps the news has not yet reached\r\nhome. I am out of breath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us! tell quickly!\"\r\n\r\nThey all seated themselves around him.\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear, mamma--things to make one wild! Come nearer: so! You\r\nknow all about the morning of the 21st, do you not? The other regiments\r\nentered: crowds, noise, music, as on the previous day, until twelve\r\no'clock. At twelve o'clock, as if by common consent, the confusion\r\nceased--first in the Corso, then in the other main streets, and\r\ngradually everywhere. The crowds of citizens stood still, formed groups\r\nand chatted in an undertone; then they dispersed in all directions,\r\nnodding to each other like people who expect to meet soon again. It\r\nseemed as if the order had circulated to prepare for some great event.\r\nPeople meeting in the street spoke to each other hastily, and then each\r\none went his own way. From one end to the other of the Corso there was a\r\ngeneral bustle, some going home, others going out; some calling from the\r\nstreet, others answering from the windows; the soldiers rushing to and\r\nfro as if they had heard a call; officers on horseback trotting by; men\r\nand boys passing with bundles of flags on their shoulders and in their\r\narms; all active and hurrying as if they were being pursued. I, who knew\r\nnothing and no one, looked now at this face, now at that, to try and\r\ndiscover something. They all seemed happy, but did not exhibit their\r\nformer boisterous, unrestrained joy: all betrayed a disturbing thought,\r\na misgiving, almost an uneasiness: one could see that they were people\r\nconcocting something. I turned into one of the smaller streets; went\r\nfarther on; stopped at two or three crossways: everywhere was the same\r\nsight--great crowds, a great stir, great haste and an indescribable\r\nmanner of speaking and gesticulating, which I had already remarked in\r\nthe Corso, as if the whole mass of people wished to conceal something\r\nfrom some one, although it was visible to every one. Knots of people\r\npassed by me, troops, hundreds of men and women together, and not a cry\r\nwas to be heard. All were going in the same direction, as if to a place\r\nof rendezvous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where were they going?\" asked the mother and father.\r\n\r\n\"Wait. I returned to the Corso. The nearer I approached, the more\r\ndistinctly I heard a dull, continuous roar, like that of an immense\r\ncrowd. I reached it: the Corso was full of people, who had all stopped\r\nand turned toward the Campidoglio, as if they were waiting for something\r\nfrom that quarter. From the Piazza del Popolo to the Piazza di Venezia\r\nthere was such a press that it was impossible to move. There was a\r\nwhispering here and there, 'They will be here in a little while;' 'They\r\nare coming yonder,'--'Who are coming yonder?'--'The main column.'--'The\r\nmain column is coming.'--'Here it is!'--'No.'--'Yes.'--All at once the\r\ncrowd began to move turbulently. Everybody cried on all sides, 'There\r\nthey are!' And in less time than I can say it the street was cleared in\r\nthe middle, as if to make way for a procession. All heads were\r\nuncovered. I, who had remained behind, elbowed my way across the street\r\nand looked. I seem to feel now a thrill that ran through me from head\r\nto foot. First advanced generals in full uniform and noblemen in black\r\ncoats with tri-colored scarfs: in the midst of the nobles and generals\r\ncame men, women and children with tattered, unbuttoned shirts; behind,\r\nwork-people, country-people, women with babies on their backs, soldiers\r\nof all arms, grand ladies, students, whole families holding each other\r\nby the hands so as not to get lost; all crowded and pressed, so that it\r\nseemed strange they were able to walk; and yet only a monotonous murmur\r\nlike a buzz was to be heard--not a sound on either side of the street,\r\nnot a sound from the windows. It was a solemn sight: what with surprise\r\nand awe I was in a trance.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where were they going?\" asked the father, mother and sisters\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Let me finish,\" resumed the young man. \"I was turned off in the mean\r\nwhile, and with me gradually all those who were leaning against the wall\r\nright and left were turned off also. Fancy what a tight squeeze! The\r\ncrowd was just like a torrent, filling both pavements, pouring people\r\nlike rushing waves into the shops, to the gates, wherever an inch of\r\nroom could be found. As the procession advanced more swarms of people\r\nstreamed into the Corso from the side streets, which were also thronged\r\nfrom end to end; and the procession continued to ascend from the\r\nCampidoglio, and the rumor spread that thousands more were coming from\r\nCampo Vaccino. Numbers of people arrived from the Piazza di Spagna, from\r\nthe Via del Babbuino, from the Piazza del Popolo. All had something in\r\ntheir hands--some garlands of flowers, some olive and laurel branches,\r\nsome banners, some rags tied on the top of sticks; some carried in both\r\nhands sacred images over their heads--inscriptions, emblems, portraits\r\nof the pope, of the king, of the princes and of Garibaldi. It was a\r\nmixture, a medley, a confusion of persons and things, such as I believe\r\nhas never been seen under the sun; and always and everywhere that\r\nsubdued murmur, that slow pace, that repose, that dignity, so singular\r\nand astonishing in such a multitude that I thought I must be dreaming.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole family pressed closer round the young man without speaking a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\"At a certain point I perceived that the crowd had turned to the left:\r\nall fell back. Slowly, slowly, with great difficulty, trampled upon,\r\ncrushed, jostled on all sides, unable to move their arms, panting for\r\nbreath, they pressed on from street to street to the piazza in front of\r\nthe bridge of St. Angelo. The bridge was overflowing with people: the\r\ncrowd disappeared across the river in the direction of St. Peter's. The\r\nwhole right bank was swarming. The passage of the bridge was a serious\r\nmatter: it took more than a quarter of an hour. The unfortunate\r\ncreatures who were at the sides, pressed by those in the middle, clung\r\ndesperately to the railings for fear of being thrown over, and uttered\r\ncries of terror. It was said that some accidents occurred. By degrees\r\nall passed over. All the streets leading to the square filled up. When\r\nthe crowd reached the entrance of one of the streets which lead directly\r\nto the Basilica, suddenly a low, hollow sound was heard, like a sea in a\r\nstorm, now far off, now near, and coming toward us in waves. It was the\r\nmultitude assembled in the Piazza di San Pietro. The crowd pressed\r\nforward more eagerly, one on top of another, carried forward,\r\noverturned--on, on, until it reached the piazza. Almighty God! if you\r\nhad seen it! What an astounding spectacle!--all this immense square\r\ntightly packed, black, and all in motion: it was no longer a square--it\r\nwas a sea. On all sides--between the four rows of columns, on the\r\nchurch-steps, under the portico, on the great terrace in front, in the\r\ngalleries of the cupola, on the capitals of the pillars, on the pillars\r\nthemselves; and behind--at the windows of the houses, on the balconies,\r\non the roofs, above, below, right and left, wherever a human creature\r\ncould plant his foot or clutch hold or hang on; everywhere heads, arms\r\nand legs dangling, banners, gestures, voices! All Rome was there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens! But the Vatican?\" they all cried in great agitation.\r\n\r\n\"Closed. You know that one wing of the Vatican opens on the square, and\r\nin that is the pope's apartment. All the windows belonging to it were\r\nclosed: it seemed like a deserted palace. At that moment it had the\r\nappearance of a cold, stern, impassive person looking down with fixed,\r\nwide-open eyes. The multitude looked up with a murmuring noise. On one\r\nside, toward the terrace, could be seen a great body of officers and\r\nnoblemen, who appeared to give orders which were repeated from mouth to\r\nmouth. The agitation continued to increase. All heads were\r\nuncovered--white heads of old men, dark heads of soldiers, blond heads\r\nof children. A bright sun was shining; a thousand movements, a thousand\r\nnoises, a thousand colors, were waving and mingling on this immense\r\nsurface. Banners and rags fluttered, tossed back here and there as if\r\nthey were floating on the water. The seething was such it seemed as if\r\nfire were burning under the earth. Suddenly, from all sides was heard\r\nand spread a cry, 'The boys! the children! Bring forward the children!'\r\nIt was evidently a concerted plan. In a moment on all parts of the\r\nsquare people were seen holding up the children above their heads, and\r\nthe men and women who were carrying them broke through the mass, all\r\ngoing in the direction of the Vatican: the bigger boys forced their own\r\nway, holding hands, rushing between the people's legs, ten and twenty at\r\na time. In a few minutes hundreds of children--a whole population of\r\ncreatures concealed until now--some by means of their own legs, some\r\npushed, some carried, were crowded into one corner of the square, and in\r\nthe mean while arose a deafening cry from the women, 'Take care! Slowly!\r\nMy child!' Soon after another louder and more imperative call, 'The\r\nwomen! the women!' Another disturbance, another breaking through the\r\ncrowd in all directions. Then a third and more formidable cry, 'The\r\narmy! the soldiers! Forward!' And once more an indescribable upheaving,\r\nbut simultaneous, resolute, rapid. There were none of the difficulties\r\nand delays usually seen in similar cases: all worked and helped to\r\naccomplish the end. There was an impetuosity, a fervor, and yet an\r\nastonishing accord: this innumerable crowd seemed ruled and controlled.\r\nBy degrees the bustle ceased, all cries were hushed, arms were dropped,\r\neverybody looked around, and it seemed as if by enchantment the\r\nchildren, the women and the soldiers had disappeared. They all stood on\r\nthe right side of the square, divided into three great masses, from the\r\ndoor of St. Peter's to the middle of the Colonnade, facing the Vatican,\r\ndense and compact. The multitude burst forth into boisterous applause.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Vatican?\" asked the family for the third time, all in the same\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\"Still closed and quiet as a convent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! great Heavens!\" they exclaimed, confounded.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! All at once the applause ceased, and all heads were seen turning\r\naround slowly and whispering, 'Silence! silence!' The murmur ran from\r\nthe beginning to the end of the two streets which open into the square.\r\nThe whisper soon died away entirely, and there was such a stillness,\r\nsuch silence, as I should never have believed possible among so many\r\npeople. It was something super-human. In the midst of this silence I\r\nseemed suddenly to hear a faint voice that I could not understand, a\r\nvague sound coming from a distance. Gradually, insensibly, it\r\nincreased--first an uplifting of voices, now far, now near, uncertain\r\nand discordant; soon more distinct, more decided, finally blending as if\r\nby magic, till a single voice, tremulous, silvery, suave, rose to\r\nheaven, echoing like the voice of a legion of angels. It was that of\r\nthousands of children singing the hymn to Pius IX. of 1847.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the mother and daughters, clasping their hands.\r\n\r\n\"That song re-echoed in every one's heart; it ascended in such a way as\r\nto touch the most tender chords of the soul; a thrill seemed to pass\r\nthrough the crowd; there was a great moving of arms and hands, as if\r\nthey wished to speak and could not. Nothing but a confused murmur was\r\nheard. 'Holy Father'--this is what they wished to say--'look! listen!\r\nThese are our children; they are your sons who seek you, who invoke you,\r\nwho implore your benediction; they are innocent souls. Hear their\r\nprayer; bless them; grant that their country and their religion shall be\r\nunited in their hearts. Holy Father, one word from you, one sign, one\r\nglance from you declaring pardon and peace, and we are with you, for\r\nyou--all of us, now, always, for ever! They are our children, your\r\nsons.' Thousands of banners waved in the air. The song ceased: a\r\nprofound silence ensued.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" they all asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"No response. Then arose the women's song. There was a deep tremor in\r\nthat immense voice: you could hear a something which only issues from\r\nthe hearts of mothers; it seemed more like a cry than a song; it was\r\nsweet and solemn. The people, from the first note, remained motionless:\r\nsuddenly, after a while, they became agitated as if moved by an\r\nirresistible ardor; the exclamations almost overpowered the song. 'These\r\nare our mothers,' they said, 'our wives, our sisters. Holy Father, hear\r\nthem. They have never cherished hatred or anger in their breasts; they\r\nhave always loved and hoped; they believe and pray; they implore the\r\nprivilege of teaching their children your name together with that of\r\nItaly. Holy Father, one word from you will save them many mournful\r\ndoubts and many bitter tears. Bless our families, Holy Father.'\"\r\n\r\nThe listeners questioned with their eyes and gestures.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing! Then burst forth a tumultuous, rapid song, followed by a more\r\nviolent agitation: it was the soldiers. 'These are our soldiers,' all\r\nsaid together--'they will be yours: they are the sons of the field and\r\nthe shops. Holy Father, they will guard your gates and escort your\r\nsteps: they, born on your soil, they who heard as children your sublime\r\ncry of liberty, will fight against the foreign enemy with your name and\r\nthat of the king on their lips and in their hearts. Bless them. You will\r\nsee them congregated around your throne in your hour of need, ready to\r\ndie: one word, Holy Father, and these swords, these breasts, this blood,\r\nare yours. They implore your blessing upon the country. Remember, Holy\r\nFather, your sublime cry.'--A window of the Vatican opened.\"\r\n\r\nAll seized the young man by the arm without saying a word.\r\n\r\n\"The song ceased, the cries were hushed: there was silence. There was\r\nnot a living soul at the window. During a few moments the very breath of\r\nthe multitude seemed suspended. Something like a shadow moved past the\r\nwindow, but inside, far back, and then disappeared. There seemed to be\r\npeople passing to and fro, and a confusion within. All faces, all eyes,\r\nwere fixed motionless on the spot. Suddenly the whole multitude, as if\r\ninspired at the same moment, pointed to the palace; thousands of women\r\nheld up the children; the soldiers swung their caps on their bayonets;\r\nall banners were waved; a hundred thousand voices burst forth in one\r\ntremendous shout: 'Viva! viva! viva!' At the window of the Vatican\r\nsomething was seen fluttering, moving, shining, all at once floating in\r\nthe air.--Great Heavens!\" exclaimed the young man, throwing himself on\r\nhis mother's neck, \"it was the Italian flag!\"\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to describe the delight, the joy, the enthusiasm\r\nof those worthy people. The young man had spoken with so much fervor, he\r\nhad become so enamored of his own deception, that by degrees he had\r\nfinally ceased to be aware of the fact that he was inventing, and truly\r\nhis eyes were moist and his voice trembled. However, not the shadow of a\r\nsuspicion had crossed the minds of his parents and sisters. They\r\nembraced each other, laughed and wept. From how many scruples, how many\r\ngrievous conflicts between Italian hearts and Catholic consciences, did\r\nthey find themselves released! The reconciliation between Church and\r\nState! The dream of so many years! What peace of mind henceforward!\r\nWhat a beautiful life of love and concord! What free, secure repose!\r\n\r\n\"Heaven be praised!\" exclaimed the mother, dropping into a low chair,\r\nexhausted by excitement.\r\n\r\nAnd then again they all rushed around the young man, one seizing his\r\nhand, another pulling him by the coat: \"Is it really true?\"--\"Is it not\r\na dream?\"--\"Speak!\"--\"Go on: tell us about everything--the pope--the\r\ncrowd--what happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"What followed?\" resumed the young man in a fatigued voice. \"To tell you\r\nthe truth, I don't know myself: I don't remember. There was such a\r\nshouting, an upheaving, a frenzy, a delirium, that the very thought of\r\nit even now makes my head whirl. I no longer saw anything around me but\r\nupraised arms and banners, which concealed everything. An elbow-knock\r\nthat I received in my breast in a terrible commotion of the crowd almost\r\ntook my breath away. After a few moments I seemed to have a little more\r\nspace, and I escaped into one of the streets leading to the bridge,\r\ndetermined to get out of the confusion. From all the streets of the\r\nBorgo Pio the people dashed with loud cries toward the square. It was\r\nsaid afterward that the crowd rushed to the doors of the Vatican to\r\nforce an entrance: the soldiers had to keep them back, first with their\r\nbreasts, then with their hands, finally with their weapons. I heard of\r\npeople suffocated in the press. It is not known what happened in the\r\ninterior of the Vatican: they said that the pope had given his blessing\r\nfrom the window. I did not see him. Weary, exhausted, I arrived at the\r\nbridge, and crossed it. People were still running from all sides,\r\nattracted by the news of the great event, which had spread like\r\nwildfire. Large troops of cavalry coursed by at full speed. Guides,\r\naides-de-camp, carbiniers, sent to carry orders hither and thither, ran\r\nthrough the streets screaming. The people answered from the windows:\r\ndecrepit old men, invalids, women with children in their arms, stood on\r\nthe terraces, came down into the deserted streets, asked questions,\r\nwondered and kissed each other. I reached the Corso. Suddenly a\r\nterrific explosion was heard from the direction of the Pincio, then\r\nanother from the Porta Pia, then a third from the Porta San Pancrazio:\r\nit was all the batteries of artillery belonging to the Italian army\r\ngreeting the Pontiff with a tumultuous salute. Presently the chiming of\r\nthe bell of the Campidoglio resounded: then gradually the bells of\r\nhundreds of churches blending into one magnificent concert. The crowd\r\nfrom the Borgo Pio rushed back impetuously to the left bank of the\r\nTiber, invading in a very short time the streets, the squares and the\r\nhouses; displayed the papal coat-of-arms, which had remained covered;\r\ncarried in triumph busts of Pius IX., portraits and banners; thousands\r\nof people assembled in front of the palaces of the nobles most noted for\r\ntheir devotion to the pope and burst into applause, and these nobles\r\nappeared on their balconies and hung out the national colors. One\r\nmoment: let me take breath.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had breathed they immediately beset him with more\r\nquestions: \"And after that? and the Vatican? and the pope?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I cannot tell you how beautiful, how grand, how\r\nwonderful, Rome was that evening. The night was transcendent, and there\r\nwas an illumination such as never was seen or imagined since the\r\ncreation of the world: the Corso appeared to be on fire. The churches\r\nwere full of people, and priests preaching; in the streets were music,\r\nsinging, dancing, citizens speaking to the people in the cafés and\r\ntheatres. I wished to see the Piazza di San Pietro once more. The rumor\r\nhad spread that His Holiness needed rest: Borgo Pio was as quiet as on\r\nthe quietest nights; the square was lit up by the moon; a silent crowd\r\nwas collected around the two fountains and on the steps: some were\r\nseated on the ground, some lying down; a great many of them, those most\r\novercome by the fatigue and excitement of the day, were asleep--women,\r\nsoldiers and children promiscuously; hundreds of people kneeling, and\r\nhere and there sentinels of every corps with little flags and crosses\r\ntied to the barrels of their guns. The ground was strewn with banners,\r\nwith leaves and flowers, and hats that had been lost in the tumult. The\r\nwindows of the Vatican were illuminated; not a voice was to be heard;\r\nall these people seemed to be holding their breath. I left there\r\nexcited, exalted, thinking over everything I had seen--of the effect\r\nthat the news would produce on Italy, on the world, on all of you--more\r\nparticularly on you, papa. I found myself at the station almost before I\r\nwas aware: there was a confusion, a deafening noise. I stepped into a\r\ntrain, started off, and here I am. The news had arrived last evening in\r\nFlorence: they told me it created a furore; the king had left; the news\r\nis already spread over the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point he sank into a low chair and stopped short, as if he had\r\nno more breath in his body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe newspapers, which should have arrived at the villa by noon, did not\r\ncome, so that the family retained their pleasant illusion until evening.\r\nThe dinner was animated, the young man continued to jumble detail on\r\ndetail, and the mother and family rapture on rapture, blessing on\r\nblessing, when suddenly they heard a hasty foot on the steps, and then a\r\nnoisy ring at the bell. Presently the door opened, and a tall, dried-up\r\npriest, with a livid face and crooked mouth, appeared on the threshold.\r\nIt was a priest whom the family had known only a short time, and of whom\r\nthey were not particularly fond, but whom they received and welcomed at\r\ntheir house--more, however, out of respect for his garb than for his\r\nperson. All except the young man grouped around him, crying out, \"Well!\r\nhave you heard the news? It is all over, thank Heaven! Tell us! speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what news?\" asked the priest, looking in the face of each one in\r\nturn with a pair of rolling eyes.\r\n\r\nThey all told him at once, hastily and eagerly, of the festival, the\r\npardon, the reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThe priest looked at all of them with the air of a man who fears that he\r\nhas fallen into the midst of a set of lunatics: then flashing a fiery\r\nglance upon the young man, he exclaimed with a sinister smile, \"There is\r\nnot a shadow of truth in it, fortunately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" they all exclaimed, turning toward the son.\r\n\r\nThe latter, without seeming disconcerted, looked fixedly at the priest,\r\nand said to him, in a half-sorrowful, half-contemptuous voice, \"Only,\r\nreverend father, do not say 'fortunately.' You are an Italian: say,\r\n'What a pity that it is not so!'\"\r\n\r\nAnd all the others flew once more at the priest, and, as is generally\r\nthe case, more incensed against the one who had destroyed the illusion\r\nthan against him who had created it, they repeated almost\r\ninvoluntarily, \"Decidedly! Say rather, 'What a pity!'\"\r\n\r\n\"I?\" answered the priest, turning toward his breast a long knotty\r\nfinger: then, in a bitter vibrant voice, \"Never!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man, thus suddenly wounded and so rudely deprived of the\r\ndelightful emotion which had agitated him, lost his wits as usual, and\r\nstretching out his arm toward the door framed with his lips the word\r\n\"Begone!\"\r\n\r\nThe priest disappeared, slamming the door behind him. The son threw his\r\narms around his father's neck: the latter, looking toward the door,\r\nmuttered in a feeble voice, \"Heartless man!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VENETIAN OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA strange figure, a man almost wholly forgotten, but one to whom Goethe,\r\nSchiller, Tieck and Schlegel owed not a little, is yet to be known by\r\nwhoever cares to rub the dust from old memoirs and turn the pages of\r\nsome rare and racy volumes. And in knowing this Venetian much may be\r\nlearned of the decadence of Venice, which had come to produce, not the\r\ngreat and reverent and serious men who laid her stones and covered her\r\nwalls with sweet and splendid works expressive of the endurance and\r\npiety of great souls, but such men as Casanova the gambler, Goldoni the\r\nplay-writer, Longhi and Canaletto the painters; and then, as the best\r\namong them all, the honest Venetian whom we now meet, sometimes called\r\nthe Shakespeare of Venice, but in fact only a play-writer, a Venetian\r\nnobleman, who depicted in a dispassionate temper the trivialities of his\r\nage, and lacked both the _milieu_ and the material to produce a great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nVenice had long reached and passed the culmination of her brilliant\r\npower, and had become the very palpitating centre of unchecked\r\ndissipation and of an extravagant luxury of living. All Europe came to\r\nit to be amused. It is impossible to frame with sober English words the\r\nbas-reliefs of those licentious times as they are found to-day in the\r\npopular songs of the Lagoons. At this epoch there was a young Venetian,\r\nCount Carlo Gozzi, who wrote for the Venetian theatre, and may be\r\nconsidered as having first invested with the dignity of literary\r\nexpression the typical figures of Italian comedy--Pantaleone, Harlequin,\r\nTartaglia, etc. He came from a literary family, and his brother, Count\r\nGaspard Gozzi, was an honored man of letters who gave several volumes to\r\nVenetian literature, and whose vivacious face in marble may be seen in\r\nthe gallery of the ducal palace with the busts of doges, prelates and\r\npainters of the great state of Venice. But he whom we think the more\r\ninteresting man, as well as the most representative, has not been\r\nhonored with bust or portrait, and we must look to his memoirs to find\r\nout what manner of man he was.\r\n\r\nCarlo Gozzi was the seventh son of one of those opulent noble Venetian\r\nfamilies which a century of indolent leisure and mad enjoyment of gayety\r\nhad reduced to a state bordering upon beggary. The family was\r\ndisorganized, and for the completion of its bad fortune the eldest son\r\nfell in love with and married a foolish literary young woman, who to an\r\nunchecked ambition of distinguishing herself either as a poetess, a\r\nwriter of plays, or as the fashionable directress of some _accademia_,\r\nadded an uncontrollable spirit of domination. She mismanaged the\r\nhousehold, rendering it intolerable to every one but herself. Gozzi's\r\ngood sense very soon convinced him that there was nothing to hope from\r\nsuch a condition of affairs, and he sought guidance and protection from\r\nhis uncle, Almore Cesare Tiepolo, the venerated senator, who recommended\r\nhim to Girolamo Quirini, governor-general of Dalmatia. It was to go\r\nthere and to meet a new fate that Gozzi, then a lad of sixteen, left\r\nVenice on board of a ship of war, having for his whole fortune his\r\nyouth, his guitar and a few books.\r\n\r\nIt was only after he had become an old man that he wrote the story of\r\nhis life, and that he so piquantly portrayed the physiognomy of the\r\nVenetian people in his famous _Memorie inutile_, which, as he quaintly\r\nsays, he published \"from humility.\" The _Memorie inutile_ in which Gozzi\r\nhas depicted himself with such lifelike realism are sincere and\r\nvivacious, and rival Diderot and Rousseau for directness, luminousness\r\nand interest. Gozzi's nature is as free from conceit as it is from that\r\nreserve which is sometimes mistaken for the enviable result of\r\nhereditary culture, when it often is but the makeshift of vanity to\r\ncover mental penury. The serenity of his soul never fails him even under\r\nthe most disheartening circumstances. His unalterable gayety, his\r\nplayfulness and his genial humor, just a little bit satirical, made him\r\nthe best of fellows and the most capital companion. None of the changes\r\nor chances of an adventurous life seem to have either abated or checked\r\nthe flow of his animal spirits. He took hold of things and of the people\r\nhe met by their laughable side. Hence the remarkable elasticity and the\r\nbuoyancy of his writings. How far he stands from the reactionary\r\nromantic movement of a later literature we may know if we notice that\r\nthere is no morbid self-retrospection and no shadow of melancholy in any\r\none page he ever wrote. When domestic difficulties and the complications\r\nattending the dismemberment of the family after the death of his\r\nparalytic father--whom he worshipped--absorbed his whole mind, and he\r\nhad to call upon his reserved strength of character to endure sorrow,\r\nGozzi kept up a brave heart. He believed in his vocation as a writer of\r\nplays, and he fed his talent by an indulgent and sympathetic\r\ncomprehension of human nature.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"It is an endless amusement for me to see the world, such as it\r\nis in my century, and to contemplate the big caldron in which all our\r\nfollies are kept boiling. Is it not an immense farce? and am I not right\r\nto make it the plaything of my reflections, and to laugh as I keep\r\ncounting the somersaults of humanity?\" These \"somersaults\" are precisely\r\nwhat Gozzi has so successfully reproduced upon the scene.\r\n\r\nIt was while he lived in wild Dalmatia that Gozzi had first revealed to\r\nhim his own dramatic genius. His protector there was a man of letters,\r\nwho lent him books and encouraged him to exercise his literary taste and\r\ntalent in scribbling sketches of character, poetical essays and such\r\nthings as usually serve as the magnetic conductor between a youth and\r\nthe people around him, whom he hardly knows. The dramatic troupe in Zara\r\nwas composed of young Venetian officers only. To amuse the governor and\r\nhis suite they distributed among themselves the different rôles of men\r\nand women, and upon some given theme they improvised those comedies\r\nwhich are so much to the taste of Italians. What a chance there was for\r\nindividual talent to reveal itself! Gozzi created spontaneously his own\r\nrôle--it was that of an Illyrian chambermaid--and in it he used the\r\nDalmatian _patois_ with such dexterity, he railed at feminine foibles\r\nwith so much _finesse_, and, using recent social scandals, he touched\r\nthe whole with such apt satire, that he had an immense success. The rôle\r\nof the fictitious chambermaid won universal admiration. Ladies of rank\r\ninquired who was that inimitable young man, and expressed the wish to\r\nhave presented to them the amateur actor. Their disappointment was\r\nunconcealed upon finding him reserved in manner, simple, and almost\r\ntimid and taciturn. We appreciate his surprise when he tells us, \"I\r\nwondered that my love of study, my chaste tastes, some literary\r\naptitude, and some serious views of life above those of my age did not\r\nproduce as favorable an impression upon the sex as did my fancy dress of\r\na Dalmatian chambermaid and my skill in gymnastic performances. But,\r\nthen, had I yet gone down into the inextricable depths of the feminine\r\nmind? and was I already acquainted with the laws that rule the magnetic\r\nattractions of the most bizarre of brains?\"\r\n\r\nThe stories Gozzi tells us of life in Dalmatia have a fresh, primitive\r\nflavor. No one ever told them before him. Their bloom is untouched, and\r\nmuch of the pleasure one has in reading them comes from that. Some of\r\nhis pictures of manners are as crisp and as vivid as a fine etching.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his residence there that little, out-of-the-way corner of\r\nEurope had not yet been awakened from the stupor of its feudal sleep,\r\nnor had the faintest breath of modern ideas so much as rippled over the\r\nsullen surface of hereditary slavery to traditional customs. From time\r\nimmemorial the habits of the people were the same, and singularly\r\nuninfluenced by the presence of the gay gallants of Venice who were\r\nstationed there. It is not difficult to imagine the distaste with which\r\nthey left all the enervating delights of their resplendent island of\r\nmarble, with its mantling of sunlight and the tranquil beauty of its\r\ndreamy days, for tedious exile among an inhospitable and untamed\r\npopulation, the severe silence and sombre forests or the monotony of\r\nbarren rocks. \"If you have read your Virgil or Homer,\" Gozzi tells us,\r\n\"you have seen Illyrians. These people are quite as pagan in their rites\r\nof marriage and the burying of their dead as any people of pagan\r\nantiquity. One of their favorite national games consists in lifting a\r\ntremendous disk cut out of marble and hurling it to a great distance. Is\r\nnot this Diomedes and Turnus?\r\n\r\n\"Contempt weighs down upon every family who has not had several of its\r\nmen killed, or has not executed cruel vengeance on the right and on the\r\nleft, or has not been itself the object of outrageous retaliation. It\r\nwas not long before I had the opportunity to ascertain the truth of what\r\nthe old priest had told me as we walked together under the walls of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\"A woman about fifty years old came one day and threw herself at the\r\nfeet of the governor. From her shoulder hung down a cumbrous gamebag,\r\nand out of it she pulled a mass of hair clinging to a dried-up skull:\r\nthen, placing the hideous object before the governor, she struck her\r\nhead against the ground, crying, 'Justice! justice!' I inquired what\r\ncould possibly be the motive of so extraordinary an exhibition, and I\r\nlearnt that the skull was that of the woman's mother, who was\r\nassassinated _thirty years before_--that the murderers had been\r\nexecuted, but that the greed for vengeance not being yet appeased in\r\nthat wild daughter of Dalmatia, she had never failed to repeat the same\r\nceremony at the installation of each successive governor, always\r\nexhibiting the same thirst for avenging herself upon the family of her\r\nenemies, the same gamebag and the same skull!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was impossible to have introduced into Dalmatia any such\r\nagricultural reform or innovation as would have ameliorated the\r\ncultivation of its fertile plains. The Dalmatian peasants were wedded to\r\nthe unintelligent routine of their forefathers, and in their ideas or\r\napprehension of things no landmark was ever removed. But, then, is the\r\nmere industry which clears the soil of any good if courage and\r\nintelligence do not second and direct material labor? Why do we so\r\nlittle care for the improvement of men? Machines and inventions are not\r\na sufficient development: it is the heart and the mind which should be\r\nworked upon, changed, electrified into new activity. Will men never\r\ncomprehend that civilization can never begin except at the soul, and\r\nthat whatever is purely material must ever be overruled by what is\r\nintellectual?\" This was written nearly a century and a half ago.\r\n\r\nThe series of little pictures which Gozzi has left us of those days,\r\nwhen upon his return from Dalmatia he realized the abasement into which\r\nthe family had finally fallen, are most vivid, and remind us of the\r\nhonest realism of the Dutch painters. And the charm of Gozzi's writings\r\nlies precisely in that sense of genuineness which more than anything\r\nelse inspires us with trust in a writer. You feel sure that whatever he\r\nrelates is the thing he has himself observed or felt, just as it\r\nhappened. All the puerile inconsistency of an age not fecundated by any\r\nbelief, in which a strong religious sense is replaced by childish\r\nsuperstition and bold materialism, is admirably rendered in the episode\r\nof the death of the old senator Almore Cesare Tiepolo. He was a man of\r\ngreat benevolence, and he distinguished himself from his peers by a rare\r\ncourtesy of manner toward his servants and the people of that class. It\r\nhappened one day that as he was stepping out of his gondola his foot\r\ncaught in the folds of his senatorial robe, and he fell down. In trying\r\nto hold him up his gondolier let go the oar, which struck Tiepolo's arm\r\nand broke it. He, however, showed no sign of pain and no irritation\r\ntoward his man, but quietly walked home and sent for the surgeon. Forty\r\ndays he was kept motionless in bed, and during all that time the same\r\nunalterable regard for the feelings of others made him gentle and\r\nuncomplaining and grateful for the care he received. But the old\r\nVenetian loved a good table; so every morning he had his gondolier come\r\nto his bedside and tell him what fish was in the market, how it looked,\r\nhow much it cost; and, giving himself up to his culinary enthusiasm with\r\nthe appreciative appetite of a connoisseur, he established the relative\r\nmerit of the different fish and discussed their flavor, till one day,\r\nwhile he was engaged in his favorite morning occupation, the end of\r\nthings came for him, and Almore Cesare Tiepolo turned his face toward\r\nthe wall, like the prophet of old, and, surrendering himself to acts of\r\nfervid contrition with the aid of his confessor, he obtained a last\r\nparting benediction and died.\r\n\r\nTwo writers, two rival would-be poets, and critics one of the other,\r\nheld then the literary sway over Venice. One was the licentious and\r\nunscrupulous Abbé Chiari, who imitated with a certain success the\r\nartificial manner of the brilliant French writers of the day: the other\r\nwas Goldoni, then at the height of his fame. It is difficult for us,\r\nplaced as we are so far from that tinselly age, to form an idea of the\r\nfever and furore of admiration which raged in Venice for these two men.\r\nA deluge of adulatory literary expression poured on every side in the\r\nshape of comedies, tragedies, plays, sonnets, poems, songs and\r\napologies, all of them inflating with a fervid enthusiasm the\r\ninflammable youth of the most mobile of populations. The comedies of\r\nGoldoni were the fashion. They were found in everybody's hands, in\r\nladies' rooms, on shop counters and on the benches of workmen. The plain\r\nliteral copy of Nature, the unblushing _sans-gêne_ of a sportive\r\ncynicism, pleased the indolent imagination of the blasé and immoral\r\nVenetians. And the infatuation was carried so far that a certain abbé,\r\nthe fashionable preacher of the day, boasted that he preached his Lent\r\nsermons only after he had read a comedy of Goldoni!\r\n\r\nGozzi fell in the very midst of that literary ebullition, and watched\r\ncuriously its ephemeral duration; for, like a brilliant soap-bubble\r\nblown by merry children, it soon vanished into nothing. Even Goldoni\r\ncould not retain his hold on minds which, if they knew it not, needed a\r\nmore satisfying nourishment than the uninspiring, material rendering of\r\ncharacters overcharged with vices or virtues inharmoniously collocated.\r\n\r\nGozzi, persecuted by extreme poverty, stepped on the scene with the\r\ndetermination and the power to substitute for works full of defects and\r\ncynical in their influence his own conceptions of life. It was throwing\r\nthe glove in the face of popular favor, and it opened literary\r\nskirmishes which lasted from 1757 to 1761, and determined his vocation\r\nas a a writer of plays and a theatrical manager. If we remember how\r\nminds had lost all nice critical perception, and had become too confused\r\nto distinguish between a good and a bad literary style, having\r\naccustomed themselves to admire at large whatever served for amusement,\r\nwe shall better understand what was the task that Gozzi took upon\r\nhimself, and appreciate the way he fulfilled it. His work was the\r\ncreation of a national theatre. He used his vivid imagination and the\r\ningenious turn of his fancy to personify the pet vices and the fatal\r\nfrivolity of the Venetians. He created fantastic beings, brilliant\r\ncaricatures and grotesque characters. They made a hit and became popular\r\nfavorites.\r\n\r\nHis plays, written especially for the dramatic troupe which he had taken\r\nunder his paternal protection, and which he loved, cared for, watched\r\nover during twenty-five years of his life, are a strong and spicy satire\r\nupon the follies of the eighteenth century--a subtle and sagacious\r\ncriticism of its universal immorality. Our humorist was greatly aided in\r\nthe prosecution of his work by the sustained rectitude of his own life.\r\nWith the naïve confidence of a child he relates to us some of his\r\nstrange experiences of men and of women--mostly of women--and we feel\r\nsorry when he is so cruelly and so unnecessarily deceived, and he must\r\nlose his implicit trust in that young prima donna in whose purity of\r\nsoul he so unreservedly believed. How many years he had seen her, day\r\nafter day, first as a mere girl, then as a young wife and a young\r\nmother, and always surrounding her with the homage of his admiration and\r\nof his respect! She appears like one of those enshrined figures one is\r\nsurprised to find in out-of-the-way places, and which, after all, have\r\nto be left to other eyes. Gozzi came very near losing the dignity of his\r\nmental quietude--and that in spite of his mature age, for he was then\r\nnearly fifty--in a Don Quixotism well worthy of a man who had so deeply\r\nimmersed his fancy in the fount of the Spanish drama, and whose head was\r\nfilled with romantic adventures. A strange, an almost unaccountable,\r\ndevotion bound him during five years to the erratic destiny of Ricci.\r\nYet his affection for her did not go beyond a sustained solicitude for\r\nher welfare and an active interest in the development of her talent. For\r\na long time he blindly believed in her moral capacities, and he went to\r\nwork with the hope of winning her permanently to a pure and an elevated\r\nlife. It is touching to watch him centring his whole interest and\r\nplacing his paternal pride in that delusive will-o'-the-wisp glimmer of\r\ngoodness which must inevitably lead hope astray. Gozzi broke off his\r\nfriendship for her the day he found out she was less than he expected\r\nher to be. But this time he did not laugh, though he tells his readers\r\nthat they may well laugh at him for his credulity, his childish,\r\nuntaught experience, his romantic effort to believe in and to create an\r\nimpossible ideal.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Gozzi's memoirs so interesting is, above all, their vitality.\r\nA fresh, bounding current of life runs through them, and while watching\r\nit you take no notice of those _débris_ of character which an austere\r\nmoralist would surely count up and remember. In the midst of extreme\r\nlicentiousness, Gozzi endeavored to awaken in the Venetians a sense of\r\nthe dignity of existence by placing before their eyes tangible ideas of\r\nvirtue. The public is a materialist by right of usage, and therefore\r\nprefers the reality of the theatre to all other forms of teaching or of\r\namusement. Rouge and tinsel have the gift of persuasion. Gozzi felt that\r\ninstinctively, and few play-writers have been more successful as an\r\ninfluence than he was. At the avenue of every new sensation, and gifted\r\nwith a quick-catching sense of gayety, he lost nothing of the play which\r\nmen and women enacted before him. He observed, he listened carefully:\r\nnothing escaped the grasp of his constructive and fanciful mind. His\r\ndaily walks through the most populous streets; his habitual lingering\r\naround the fashionable shops where pretty modistes attracted the idle\r\nadmiration of idlers; his morning visit to the Rialto, and his\r\nnever-failing appearance on the Piazza when everybody was assembled\r\nthere in the afternoon,--these were the varied sources of his study of\r\nhis contemporaries and also of his dramatic inspiration. Though at that\r\ntime there were several playhouses in Venice, and going to the theatre\r\nwas then, as it is now, the favorite way of spending the evening, no\r\ntheatre was so well patronized and so crowded as that of San Samuele,\r\nwhere Venetian nobles and high-born women dazzled the eye of the people\r\nwith their splendor, while an unbounded admiration welcomed some new\r\nplay from the well-known, the genial and much-loved Count Carlo Gozzi.\r\nAnd yet, reading these same plays, may we not somewhat wonder at the\r\nextravagant praise that was showered upon them in those far-off days?\r\nThey are sketchy, sparkling, interesting by their movement and color.\r\nLike a piece of faceted glass they catch and radiate light. But they are\r\nnot distinguished by any originality of thought nor by a profound and\r\nfar-reaching philosophy. They are society-studies, an exact portraying\r\nof what was considered _le beau monde_. Gozzi had too much common sense\r\nand too much honesty of nature not to be very much shocked by the avowed\r\ncynicism which it was the fashion then to parade. He takes pains to aim\r\nagainst it the full and spicy expression of his disfavor, considering it\r\nas a fatal outgrowth of French infidelity. Therefore he deserves to be\r\nconsidered a moral writer. The freedom of his language is only the seal\r\nof realism affixed to his writings, such as we find it in Shakespeare.\r\nNothing could be more unlike and dissimilar in the after-taste which\r\nthey leave on the mental palate than these very plays which we are\r\nconsidering and any French play of our own time. In Gozzi the moralist\r\nlines the writer, and that, perhaps more than anything else, establishes\r\nthe different character of his literary influence from that of Goldoni.\r\nHe says that he wrote his plays for his own pleasure first, and with a\r\nwish to illustrate for his fellow-citizens a joyous and wholesome moral.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago one of the most famous comedies of Gozzi was given\r\nto the Venetian public. _Le Droghe d'Amore_ (\"Love's Potion\") caused so\r\nmuch perturbation in its author, and so much excitement and importance\r\nin the Venetian people, so much manoeuvring and intriguing was set to\r\nwork for and against it, and so much more was said and felt and suffered\r\nabout it, that for its adventurous _entrée_ into the world, if for\r\nnothing else, it deserves a special notice. What was, then, the cause of\r\nall this stirring-up of passions and of prejudices? And how could it\r\nhappen that an inoffensive dramatic representation of character should\r\nhave proved the spark which suddenly set on fire a perfect powder-house\r\nof human interests? It occurred in this manner: On the night of the\r\nfirst representation the Venetian public recognized in the character of\r\nDon Adone the well-known and fashionable figure of Pietro Gratarol,\r\nsecretary of the august Senate of Venice, and, in spite of such a\r\ncharge, one of the most unscrupulous profligates and successful _roués_\r\nof the time. Young as he was, and handsome, he had acquired the marked\r\nreputation of an exquisite in the salons of Venice, where he was a\r\nleader and used the prestige of his influence to introduce foreign\r\ncustoms. No man was more universally known in every grade of society\r\nthan he was, and his _bonnes fortunes_ as a gambler and as a man of\r\npleasure formed an important subject of the daily conversation of the\r\nmen and women who dispensed public favor. He was therefore a conspicuous\r\nperson, and whatever happened to him became an object of general\r\ninterest to people as frivolous as he. It was of course impossible for\r\nhim to remain indifferent to the spectacle of his own ridicule placed\r\nbefore the laughter of the public. His indignation was immense, and with\r\nthe help of such of his admirers as he could rally around him he formed\r\na clique bent upon destroying Gozzi as a writer. They employed every\r\nmeans of calumny to effect it, but failed. The piece, which for a time\r\nhad been withdrawn by superior order, was again given, and was received\r\nwith triumphant applause. It was something gained to have in a manner\r\nbrought the censorship to terms and forced it to change its verdict. The\r\nstar of Gratarol set for ever. He was no longer admired, but he was\r\npitilessly laughed at or patronized with crushing compassion wherever he\r\nappeared; and wounded self-love, wounded vanity, everything, combined to\r\nexcite a desire for revenge. But honest Gozzi had not intended any\r\npersonal allusion in the writing of his play, and was hardly responsible\r\nfor the characterization of a quick-witted public. Parties, however,\r\nbecame so envenomed about the whole affair that Gratarol was finally\r\nbanished from Venice, on the ground of having slanderously attacked the\r\nreputation of Gozzi in a pamphlet which was suppressed; and he withdrew\r\nto Stockholm, where he died.\r\n\r\nBut for that episode of his picturesque life Gozzi would never have\r\ngiven us his memoirs. He wrote them not from a motive of vanity, but\r\nonly to let the world have a fair chance of judging his character\r\ncorrectly. Surely, a man as conspicuous as he was in his day had the\r\nright to get a hearing before his contemporaries, and to leave unblurred\r\nby prejudices or false impressions the mirror of public memory in which\r\nhis figure was to reflect itself.\r\n\r\nWhen Aristophanes amused the Athenians with his satirical or comical\r\nallusions to those great men of the republic who were his\r\ncontemporaries--Euripides, Plato, Socrates or Cleon--was he not mostly\r\nprompted by his indomitable conservatism, which made him the avowed\r\nenemy of all innovation in ideas and customs? It is that resemblance\r\nbetween the Greek poet and the Venetian writer which has made some\r\ncritics call Gozzi the Aristophanes of the eighteenth century. He hated\r\nthe bold and sacrilegious hands of modern philosophy, because it pulled\r\ndown and trampled under foot the traditions and the usages which the\r\ncherishing care of centuries had consecrated as the guiding-star of\r\nhonor in the heart of the people. He hated the inroad of foreign ideas\r\nand of foreign independence in the conduct of life. He believed in the\r\nsacredness of custom and authority, and he preached it _con amore_ in\r\nall his writings.\r\n\r\nGozzi lived an isolated and studious life. He seldom left his old ruined\r\npalace, where at night \"dances of rats\" alone disturbed his quiet,\r\nexcept on his way to rehearsals or to the evening representations. No\r\nman in Venice was more loved; and well might he be, for he gave bread\r\nand support to the whole of that little dramatic world of which he was\r\nthe centre and the inspiration. As he never consented to sell his work,\r\nhe remained very poor. His habits were simple, and with his own\r\ninimitable _naïveté_ he confesses that the whole of his worldly care\r\nconsists in having the largest of silver buckles on his shoes and\r\nkeeping his wig in the fashion.\r\n\r\nVenice during the eighty years of Gozzi's life was the Venice of\r\nunprincipled, corrupt men and women. It had become a masked ball, a mad\r\npleasure-place, where intrigue and adventure gave the chief interest to\r\neach day. In art, in letters and in the conduct of life the most\r\nfrivolous or trivial or fleeting occupations engaged the attention and\r\nabsorbed the time. The old men forgot the dignity of their age in a\r\npuerile leisure, and the young men were dissipated and purposeless.\r\nPeople had nothing to do but to laugh at each other and to play with the\r\npassing moment; and the loss of all sense of moral responsibility left\r\nthem adrift in the midst of the most glorious of national memories. One\r\nhas to wonder at the strange indifference which settled over those\r\ndescendants of the illustrious men whose names are built into the\r\nmagnificent palaces on both sides of the Grand Canal; and there is\r\nperhaps no greater lesson than that which may be learnt from studying\r\nthe private history of the noble patrician families of Venice of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries--men whose hearts were opened to all\r\ngreat emotions--and by looking at the marionette life of the men and\r\nwomen of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, such as it is\r\nportrayed in the pictures of Longhi, where the _Chamber of Sighs_ never\r\nempties itself of the opulent gamblers who patronized the Ridotto night\r\nand day.\r\n\r\nWhen Gozzi was a young man his first initiation into life had been a\r\nrepeated experience of the playful capriciousness of the sex, and he\r\nnever forgot it. What a commentary on the fair Venetians is his remark,\r\n\"I do not admit the possibility for a woman to know love\"! In his eyes\r\nshe remains a being incapable of any grand and sustained sacrifice of\r\nher instincts to the ennobling mastery of moral responsibility. In all\r\nhis dramas, plays and comedies there is but one character of a woman\r\nwhich is at all magnetic or lovable--that of Angela, the heroine of the\r\nplay of the _Deer Ring_. It is a pleasure to meet at last that gentle\r\nand guileless feminine personality after you have wearied of the tinsel\r\nflimsiness, the bubbling frivolity, the sparkling emptiness of the\r\nsociety-women who so turned the head of the age in which they lived, and\r\nhave so scandalously immortalized it.\r\n\r\nGoldoni and Gozzi have both given us plays which show us that scandal\r\nand intrigue were the favorite seasoning of the stale stuff of Venetian\r\nlife after it had lost its religion and its patriotic ideal. Triviality\r\nfor triviality, we prefer Gozzi.\r\n\r\n     As for Venice and her people, merely born to bloom and drop,\r\n     Here on earth they bore their fruitage: mirth and folly were the crop.\r\n     What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to stop?\r\n\r\n                                                   H.

There he landed, and left the dinghy in the shelter of\r\nthe rocks--the fish covered with long, broad-leaved _tangles_--climbed\r\nthe steep cliff and sought Blue Peter. The brown village was quiet as a\r\nchurchyard, although the sun was now growing hot. Of the men, some were\r\nnot yet returned from the night's fishing, and some were asleep in their\r\nbeds after it: not a chimney smoked. But Malcolm seemed to have in his\r\nown single being life and joy enough for a world: such an intense\r\nconsciousness of bliss burned within him that in the sightless,\r\nmotionless village he seemed to himself to stand like an altar blazing\r\nin the midst of desert Carnac. But he was not the only one awake: on the\r\nthreshold of Peter's cottage sat his little Phemy, trying to polish a\r\nbit of serpentine marble upon the doorstep with the help of water, which\r\nstood by her side in a broken tea-cup. She lifted her sweet gray eyes\r\nand smiled him a welcome.\r\n\r\n\"Are ye up a'ready, Phemy?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I haena been doon yet,\" she answered, \"My mither was oot last nicht wi'\r\nthe boat, an' Auntie Jinse was wi' the bairn, an' sae I cud du as I\r\nlikit.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' what did ye like, Phemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"A'body kens what I like,\" answered the child: \"I was oot an' aboot a'\r\nnicht. An' eh, Ma'colm! I hed a vision.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that, Phemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was upo' the tap o' the Nose jist as the sun rase, luikin' aboot me,\r\nan' awa' upo' the Boar's Tail I saw twa angels sayin' their prayers. Nae\r\ndoobt they war prayin' for the haill warl' i' the quaiet o' the mornin'\r\nafore the din begun. May be ane o' them was that auld priest wi' the\r\nlang name i' the buik o' Genesis, 'at hed naither father nor mither,\r\npuir man!--him 'at gaed aboot blissin' fowk.\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm thought he might take his own time to set the child right, and\r\nasked her to go and tell her father that he wanted to see him. In a few\r\nminutes Blue Peter appeared, rubbing his eyes--one of the dead called\r\ntoo early from the tomb of sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Freen' Peter,\" said Malcolm, \"I'm gaein' to speak oot the day.\"\r\n\r\nPeter woke up. \"Weel,\" he said, \"I _am_ glaid o' that, Ma'colm--I beg\r\nyer pardon, my lord, I sud say.--Annie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Haud a quaiet sough, man. I wadna hae 't come oot at Scaurnose first.\r\nI'm come noo 'cause I want ye to stan' by me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wull that, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weel, gang an' gether yer boat's crew, an' fess them doon to the cove,\r\nan' I'll tell them, an' maybe they'll stan' by me as weel.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's little fear o' that, gien I ken my men,\" answered Peter, and\r\nwent off, rather less than half clothed, the sun burning hot upon his\r\nback, through the sleeping village to call them, while Malcolm went and\r\nwaited beside the dinghy.\r\n\r\nAt length six men in a body, and one lagging behind, appeared coming\r\ndown the winding path, all but Peter no doubt wondering why they were\r\ncalled so soon from their beds on such a peaceful morning after being\r\nout the night before.\r\n\r\nMalcolm went to meet them. \"Freen's,\" he said, \"I'm in want o' yer\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Onything ye like, Ma'colm, sae far 's I'm concernt, 'cep' it be to ride\r\nyer mere. That I wull no tak in han',\" said Jeames Gentle.\r\n\r\n\"It's no that,\" returned Malcolm. \"It's naething freely sae hard 's\r\nthat, I'm thinkin'. The hard 'ill be to believe what I'm gaein' to tell\r\nye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll no be gaein' to set up for a proaphet?\" said Girnel, with\r\nsomething approaching a sneer. Girnel was the one who came down behind\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n\"Na, na--naething like it,\" said Blue Peter.\r\n\r\n\"But first ye'll promise to hand yer tongues for half a day?\" said\r\nMalcolm.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, we'll no clype.\" \"We s' haud wer tongues!\" cried one and\r\nanother and another, and all seemed to assent.\r\n\r\n\"Weel,\" said Malcolm, \"my name 's no Ma'colm MacPhail, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"We a' ken that,\" said Girnel.\r\n\r\n\"An' what mair du ye ken?\" asked Blue Peter, with some anger at his\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n\"Ow, naething.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weel, ye ken little,\" said Peter; and the rest laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm the markis o' Lossie,\" said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nEvery man but Peter laughed again: all took it for a joke precursive of\r\nsome serious announcement. That which it would have least surprised them\r\nto hear would have been that he was a natural son of the late marquis.\r\n\r\n\"My name 's Ma'colm Colonsay,\" resumed Malcolm quietly, \"an' I'm the\r\nsaxt markis o' Lossie.\"\r\n\r\nA dead silence followed, and in doubt, astonishment, bewilderment and\r\nvague awe, accompanied in the case of two or three by a strong\r\ninclination to laugh, with which they struggled, belief began. Always a\r\ncurious observer of humanity, Malcolm calmly watched them. From discord\r\nof expression, most of their faces had grown idiotic. But after a few\r\nmoments of stupefaction, first one, then another, turned his eyes upon\r\nBlue Peter, and perceiving that the matter was to him not only serious,\r\nbut evidently no news, each began to come to his senses, the chaos\r\nwithin him slowly arranged itself, and his face gradually settled into\r\nan expression of sanity--the foolishness disappearing, while the wonder\r\nand pleasure remained.\r\n\r\n\"Ye maunna tak it ill, my lord,\" said Peter, \"gien the laads be ta'en\r\naback wi' the news. It's a some suddent shift o' the win', ye see, my\r\nlord.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wuss yer lordship weel,\" thereupon said one, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Lang life to yer lordship!\" said another.\r\n\r\nEach spoke a hearty word and shook hands with him--all except Girnel,\r\nwho held back, looking on with his right hand in his trouser-pocket. He\r\nwas one who always took the opposite side--a tolerably honest and\r\ntrustworthy soul, with a good many knots and pieces of crossgrain in the\r\ntimber of him. His old Adam was the most essential and thorough of\r\ndissenters, always arguing and disputing, especially on theological\r\nquestions. \"Na,\" said Girnel, \"ye maun saitisfee me first wha ye are,\r\nan' what ye want o' me. I'm no to be drawn into onything 'at I dinna ken\r\na' aboot afore-han'. I s' no tie mysel' up wi' ony promises. Them 'at\r\ngangs whaur they kenna may lan' at the widdie (_gallows_).\"\r\n\r\n\"Nae doobt,\" said Malcolm, \"yer ain jeedgement's mair to ye nor my word,\r\nGirnel; but saw ye ever onything in me 'at wad justifee ye in no\r\nlippenin' to that, sae far's it gaed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ow na! I'm no sayin' that, naither. But what hae ye to shaw anent the\r\nprivin' o' 't?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have papers signed by my father, the late marquis, and sealed and\r\nwitnessed by well-known gentlemen of the neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whaur are they?\" said Girnel, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I don't carry such valuable things about me,\" answered Malcolm. \"But if\r\nyou go with the rest you shall see them afterward.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll du naething i' the dark,\" persisted Girnel. \"Whan I see the\r\npeppers I'll ken what to du.\" With a nod of the head as self-important\r\nas decisive he turned his back.\r\n\r\n\"At all events,\" said Malcolm, \"you will say nothing about it before you\r\nhear from one of us again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mak nae promises,\" answered Girnel from behind his own back.\r\n\r\nA howl arose from the rest.\r\n\r\n\"Ye promised a'ready,\" said Blue Peter.\r\n\r\n\"Na, I didna that: I said never a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"What right, then, had you to remain and listen to my disclosure?\" said\r\nMalcolm. \"If you be guilty of such a mean trick as betray me and ruin my\r\nplans, no honest man in Portlossie or Scaurnose but will scorn you.\"\r\n\r\n\"There! tak ye that!\" said Peter. \"An' I s' promise ye, ye s' never lay\r\nleg ower the gunnel o' _my_ boat again. I s' hae nane but Christi-an men\r\ni' _my_ pey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye hired me for the sizzon, Blew Peter,\" said Girnel, turning\r\ndefiantly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! ye s' hae yer wauges. I'm no ane to creep oot o' a bargain, or say\r\n'at I didna promise. Ye s' hae yer penny. Ye s' get yer reward, never\r\nfear. But into my boat ye s' no come. We'll hae nae Auchans i' oor camp.\r\nEh, Girnel, man, but ye hae lost yersel' the day! He'll never loup far\r\n'at winna lippen. The auld worthies tuik their life i' their han', but\r\nye tak yer fit (_foot_) i' yours. I'm clean affrontit 'at ever I hed ye\r\namo' my men.\"\r\n\r\nBut with that there rushed over Peter the recollection of how he had\r\nhimself mistrusted--not Malcolm's word indeed, but his heart. He turned,\r\nand clasping his hands in sudden self-reproach, \"My lord, I saired ye\r\nill mysel' ance,\" he cried, \"for I misdoobted 'at ye wasna the same to\r\nme efter ye cam to yer ain. I beg yer pardon, my lord, here i' the face\r\no' my freen's. It was ill-temper an' pride i' me, jist the same as it's\r\nnoo in Girnel there; an' ye maun forgie him, as ye forgae me, my lord,\r\nas sune 's ye can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll du that, my Peter, the verra moment he wants to be forgi'en,\" said\r\nMalcolm.\r\n\r\nBut Girnel turned with a grunt, and moved away toward the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"This'll never du,\" said Peter. \"A man 'at's honest i' the main may play\r\nthe verra dog afore he gets the deevil oot o' 'im ance he's in like\r\nthat.--Gang efter 'im, laads, an' kep (_intercept_) 'im an' keep 'im.\r\nWe'll hae to cast a k-not or twa aboot 'im an' lay 'im i' the boddom o'\r\nthe boat.\"\r\n\r\nThe six had already started after him like one man. But Malcolm cried,\r\n\"Let him go: he has done me no wrong yet, and I don't believe will do me\r\nany. But for no risk must we prevent wrong with wrong.\"\r\n\r\nSo Girnel was allowed to depart--scarcely in peace, for he was already\r\nashamed of himself. With the understanding that they were to be ready to\r\nhis call, and that they should hear from him in the course of the day,\r\nMalcolm left them and rowed back to the Psyche. There he took his basket\r\nof fish on his arm, which he went and distributed according to his\r\npurpose, ending with Mrs. Courthope at the House. Then he fed and\r\ndressed Kelpie, saddled her and galloped to Duff Harbor, where he found\r\nMr. Soutar at breakfast, and arranged with him to be at Lossie House at\r\ntwo o'clock. On his way back he called on Mr. Morrison, and requested\r\nhis presence at the same hour. Skirting the back of the House, and\r\nriding as straight as he could, he then made for Scaurnose, and\r\nappointed his friends to be near the House at noon, so placed as not to\r\nattract observation, and yet be within hearing of his whistle from door\r\nor window in the front. Returning to the House, he put up Kelpie, rubbed\r\nher down and fed her; then, finding there was yet some time to spare,\r\npaid a visit to the factor. He found his lady, for all his present of\r\nfish in the earlier morning, anything but friendly. She did all she\r\ncould to humble him--insisted on paying him for the fish, and ordered\r\nhim, because they smelt of the stable, to take off his boots before he\r\nwent up stairs--to his master's room, as she phrased it. But Mr. Crathie\r\nwas cordial, and, to Malcolm's great satisfaction, much recovered. He\r\nhad better than pleasant talk with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nLIZZY'S BABY.\r\n\r\nWhile they were out in the fishing-boat together, Clementina had, with\r\nless difficulty than she had anticipated, persuaded Lizzy to tell Lady\r\nLossie her secret. It was in the hope of an interview with her false\r\nlover that the poor girl had consented so easily.\r\n\r\nA great longing had risen within her to have the father of her child\r\nacknowledge him--only to her--taking him once in his arms. That was all.\r\nShe had no hope--thought indeed she had no desire--for herself. But a\r\nkind word to him would be welcome as light. The love that covers sins\r\nhad covered the multitude of his, and although hopelessness had put\r\ndesire to sleep, she would gladly have given her life for a loving smile\r\nfrom him. But mingled with this longing to see him once with his child\r\nin his arms, a certain loyalty to the house of Lossie also influenced\r\nher to listen to the solicitation of Lady Clementina and tell the\r\nmarchioness the truth. She cherished no resentment against Liftore, but\r\nnot therefore was she willing to allow a poor young thing like Lady\r\nLossie, whom they all liked, to be sacrificed to such a man, who would\r\ndoubtless at length behave badly enough to her also.\r\n\r\nWith trembling hands, and heart now beating wildly, now failing for\r\nfear, she dressed her baby and herself as well as she could, and about\r\none o'clock went to the House.\r\n\r\nNow, nothing would have better pleased Lady Clementina than that Liftore\r\nand Lizzy should meet in Florimel's presence, but she recoiled\r\naltogether from the small stratagems, not to mention the lies, necessary\r\nto the effecting of such a confrontation. So she had to content herself\r\nwith bringing the two girls together, and when Lizzy was a little rested\r\nand had had a glass of wine, went to look for Florimel.\r\n\r\nShe found her in a little room adjoining the library, which, on her\r\nfirst coming to Lossie, she had chosen for her waking nest. Liftore had,\r\nif not quite the freedom of the spot, yet privileges there, but at that\r\nmoment Florimel was alone in it. Clementina informed her that a\r\nfisher-girl, with a sad story which she wanted to tell her, had come to\r\nthe house; and Florimel, who was not only kind-hearted, but relished the\r\nposition she imagined herself to occupy as lady of the place, at once\r\nassented to her proposal to bring the young woman to her there.\r\n\r\nNow, Florimel and the earl had had a small quarrel the night before,\r\nafter Clementina left the dinner-table, and for the pleasure of keeping\r\nit up Florimel had not appeared at breakfast, and had declined to ride\r\nwith his lordship, who had therefore been all the morning on the watch\r\nfor an opportunity of reconciling himself. It so happened that from the\r\nend of one of the long narrow passages in which the house abounded, he\r\ncaught a glimpse of Clementina's dress vanishing through the\r\nlibrary-door, and took the lady for Florimel on her way to her boudoir.\r\n\r\nWhen Clementina entered with Lizzy carrying her child, Florimel\r\ninstantly suspected the truth, both as to who she was and as to the\r\ndesign of her appearance. Her face flushed, for her heart filled with\r\nanger, chiefly indeed against Malcolm, but against the two women as\r\nwell, who, she did not doubt, had lent themselves to his designs,\r\nwhatever they might be. She rose, drew herself up, and stood prepared to\r\nact for both Liftore and herself.\r\n\r\nScarcely, however, had the poor girl, trembling at the evident\r\ndispleasure the sight of her caused in Florimel, opened her mouth to\r\nanswer her haughty inquiry as to her business, when Lord Liftore, daring\r\nan entrance without warning, opened the door behind her, and almost as\r\nhe opened it began his apology. At the sound of his voice Lizzy turned\r\nwith a cry, and her small remaining modicum of self-possession vanished\r\nat sight of him round whose phantom in her bosom whirred the leaves of\r\nher withered life on the stinging blasts of her shame and sorrow. As\r\nmuch from inability to stand as in supplication for the coveted favor,\r\nshe dropped on her knees before him, incapable of uttering a word, but\r\nholding up her child imploringly. Taken altogether by surprise, and not\r\nknowing what to say or do, the earl stood and stared for a moment; then,\r\nmoved by a dull spirit of subterfuge, fell back on the pretence of\r\nknowing nothing about her. \"Well, young woman,\" he said, affecting\r\ncheerfulness, \"what do you want with me? I didn't advertise for a baby.\r\nPretty child though!\"\r\n\r\nLizzy turned white as death, and her whole body seemed to give a heave\r\nof agony. Clementina had just taken the child from her arms when she\r\nsank motionless at his feet. Florimel went to the bell.\r\n\r\nBut Clementina prevented her from ringing. \"I will take her away,\" she\r\nsaid. \"Do not expose her to your servants. Lady Lossie, my Lord Liftore\r\nis the father of this child; and if you can marry him after the way you\r\nhave seen him use its mother, you are not too good for him, and I will\r\ntrouble myself no more about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the author of this calumny,\" cried Florimel, panting and\r\nflushed. \"You have been listening to the inventions of an ungrateful\r\ndependant. You slander my guest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a calumny, my lord? Do I slander you?\" said Lady Clementina,\r\nturning sharply upon the earl.\r\n\r\nHis lordship made her a cool obeisance.\r\n\r\nClementina ran into the library, laid the child in a big chair, and\r\nreturned for the mother. She was already coming a little to herself and\r\nfeeling about blindly for her baby, while Florimel and Liftore were\r\nlooking out of the window, with their backs toward her. Clementina\r\nraised and led her from the room. But in the doorway she turned and\r\nsaid, \"Good-bye, Lady Lossie. I thank you for your hospitality, but I\r\ncan of course be your guest no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not. There is no occasion for prolonged leave-taking,\"\r\nFlorimel returned with the air of a woman of forty.\r\n\r\n\"Florimel, you will curse the day you marry that man,\" cried Clementina,\r\nand closed the door.\r\n\r\nShe hurried Lizzy to the library, put the baby in her arms, and clasped\r\nthem both in her own.\r\n\r\nA gush of tears lightened the oppressed heart of the mother. \"Lat me oot\r\no' the hoose, for God's sake!\" she cried; and Clementina, almost as\r\nanxious to leave it as she, helped her down to the hall. When she saw\r\nthe open door she rushed out of it as if escaping from the pit.\r\n\r\nNow, Malcolm, as he came from the factor's, had seen her go in with her\r\nbaby in her arms, and suspected the hand of Clementina. Wondering and\r\nanxious, but not very hopeful as to what might come of it, he waited\r\nclose by; and when now he saw Lizzy dart from the house in wild\r\nperturbation, he ran from the cover of the surrounding trees into the\r\nopen drive to meet her.\r\n\r\n\"Ma'colm!\" groaned the poor girl, holding out her baby, \"he winna own\r\ntill 't! He winna alloo 'at he kens aucht aboot me or the bairn aither!\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm had taken the child from her, and was clasping him to his bosom.\r\n\"He's the warst rascal, Lizzy,\" he said, \"'at ever God made an' the\r\ndeevil blaudit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Na, na,\" cried Lizzy; \"the likes o' him whiles kills the wuman, but he\r\nwadna du that. Na, na, he's nae the warst: there's a heap waur nor him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did ye see my mistress?\" asked Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\"Ow ay, but she luikit sae angry at me, I cudna speyk. Him an' her's\r\nower thrang for her to believe onything again' 'im. An' whatever the\r\nbairn 's to du wantin' a father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lizzy,\" said Malcolm, clasping the child again to his bosom, \"I s' be a\r\nfather to yer bairn--that is, as weel's ane 'at's no yer man can be.\"\r\nAnd he kissed the child tenderly.\r\n\r\nThe same moment an undefined impulse--the drawing of eyes probably--made\r\nhim lift his toward the house: half leaning from the open window of the\r\nboudoir above him stood Florimel and Liftore, and just as he looked up\r\nLiftore was turning to Florimel with a smile that seemed to say, \"There!\r\nI told you so! He is the father himself.\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm replaced the infant in his mother's arms and strode toward the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nImagining he went to avenge her wrongs, Lizzy ran after him. \"Ma'colm!\r\nMa'colm!\" she cried, \"for my sake! He's the father o' my bairn!\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm turned. \"Lizzy,\" he said solemnly, \"I winna lay han' upon 'im.\"\r\n\r\nLizzy pressed her child closer with a throb of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Come in yersel' an' see,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"I daurna! I daurna!\" she said. But she lingered about the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCLOSURE.\r\n\r\nWhen the earl saw Malcolm coming, although he was no coward and had\r\nreason to trust his skill, yet knowing himself both in the wrong and\r\nvastly inferior in strength to his enemy, it may be pardoned him that\r\nfor the next few seconds his heart doubled its beats. But of all things\r\nhe must not show fear before Florimel. \"What can the fellow be after\r\nnow?\" he said. \"I must go down to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! don't go near him: he may be violent,\" objected Florimel, and\r\nlaid her hand on his arm with a beseeching look in her face. \"He is a\r\ndangerous man.\"\r\n\r\nLiftore laughed. \"Stop here till I return,\" he said, and left the room.\r\n\r\nBut Florimel followed, fearful of what might happen, and enraged with\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\nMalcolm's brief detention by Lizzy gave Liftore a little advantage, for\r\njust as Malcolm approached the top of the great staircase, Liftore\r\ngained it. Hastening to secure the command of the position, and resolved\r\nto shun all parley, he stood ready to strike. Malcolm, however, caught\r\nsight of him and his attitude in time, and, fearful of breaking his word\r\nto Lizzy, pulled himself up abruptly a few steps from the top just as\r\nFlorimel appeared.\r\n\r\n\"MacPhail,\" she said, sweeping to the stair like an indignant goddess,\r\n\"I discharge you from my service. Leave the house instantly.\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm turned, flew down, and ran to the servants' stair, half the\r\nlength of the house away. As he crossed the servants' hall he saw Rose.\r\nShe was the only one in the house except Clementina to whom he could\r\nlook for help. \"Come after me, Rose,\" he said, without stopping.\r\n\r\nShe followed instantly, as fast as she could run, and saw him enter the\r\ndrawing-room. Florimel and Liftore were there. The earl had Florimel's\r\nhand in his.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, my lady!\" cried Malcolm, \"hear me one word before you\r\npromise that man anything.\"\r\n\r\nHis lordship started back from Florimel, and turned upon Malcolm in a\r\nfury. But he had not now the advantage of the stair, and hesitated.\r\nFlorimel's eyes dilated with wrath.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you for the last time, my lady,\" said Malcolm, \"if you marry\r\nthat man, you will marry a liar and a scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\nLiftore laughed, and his imitation of scorn was wonderfully successful,\r\nfor he felt sure of Florimel, now that she had thus taken his part.\r\n\"Shall I ring for the servants, Lady Lossie, to put the fellow out?\" he\r\nsaid. \"The man is as mad as a March hare.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, Lady Clementina, her maid having gone to send her man to get\r\nhorses for her at once, was alone in her room, which was close to the\r\ndrawing-room: hearing Malcolm's voice, she ran to the door, and saw Rose\r\nin a listening attitude at that of the drawing-room. \"What are you doing\r\nthere?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. MacPhail told me to follow him, my lady, and I am waiting here till\r\nhe wants me.\"\r\n\r\nClementina went into the drawing-room, and was present during all that\r\nnow follows. Lizzy also, hearing loud voices and still afraid of\r\nmischief, had come peering up the stair, and now approached the other\r\ndoor, behind Florimel and the earl.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" cried Florimel, \"this is the way you keep your promise to my\r\nfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, my lady. To associate the name of Liftore with his would be to\r\nblot the scutcheon of Lossie. He is not fit to walk the street with men:\r\nhis touch is to you an utter degradation. My lady, in the name of your\r\nfather, I beg a word with you in private.\"\r\n\r\n\"You insult me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg of you, my lady, for your own dear sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once more I order you to leave my house, and never set foot in it\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear her ladyship?\" cried Liftore. \"Get out!\" He approached\r\nthreateningly.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back,\" said Malcolm. \"If it were not that I promised the poor\r\ngirl carrying your baby out there, I should soon--\"\r\n\r\nIt was unwisely said: the earl came on the bolder. For all Malcolm could\r\ndo to parry, evade or stop his blows, he had soon taken several pretty\r\nsevere ones. Then came the voice of Lizzy in an agony from the door:\r\n\"Haud aff o' yersel', Ma'colm: I canna bide it. I gie ye back yer word.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll manage yet, Lizzy,\" answered Malcolm, and kept warily retreating\r\ntoward a window. Suddenly he dashed his elbow through a pane, and gave a\r\nloud shrill whistle, the same instant receiving a blow over the eye\r\nwhich the blood followed. Lizzy made a rush forward, but the terror that\r\nthe father would strike the child he had disowned seized her, and she\r\nstood trembling.\r\n\r\nAlready, however, Clementina and Rose had darted between, and, full of\r\nrage as he was, Liftore was compelled to restrain himself. \"Oh!\" he\r\nsaid, \"if ladies want a share in the row, I must yield my place,\" and\r\ndrew back.\r\n\r\nThe few men-servants now came hurrying all together into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Take that rascal there and put him under the pump,\" said Liftore. \"He\r\nis mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"My fellow-servants know better than touch me,\" said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nThe men looked to their mistress. \"Do as my lord tells you,\" she said,\r\n\"and instantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men,\" said Malcolm, \"I have spared that foolish lord there for the sake\r\nof this fisher-girl and his child, but don't one of _you_ touch me.\"\r\n\r\nStoat was a brave-enough man, and not a little jealous of Malcolm, but\r\nhe dared not obey his mistress.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the tramp of many feet along the landing from the\r\nstair-head, and the six fishermen entered, two and two.\r\n\r\nFlorimel started forward. \"My brave fishermen!\" she cried, \"take that\r\nbad man, MacPhail, and put him out of my grounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I canna du 't, my leddy,\" answered their leader.\r\n\r\n\"Take Lord Liftore,\" said Malcolm, \"and hold him while I make him\r\nacquainted with a fact or two which he may judge of consequence to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe men walked straight up to the earl. He struck right and left, but\r\nwas overpowered in a moment and held fast.\r\n\r\n\"Stan' still,\" said Peter, \"or I hae a han'fu' o' twine i' my pooch 'at\r\nI'll jist cast a k-not aboot yer airms wi' in a jiffey.\"\r\n\r\nHis lordship stood still, muttering curses.\r\n\r\nThen Malcolm stepped into the middle of the room, approaching his\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you to leave the house,\" Florimel shrieked, beside herself with\r\nfury, yet pale as marble with a growing terror for which she could ill\r\nhave accounted.\r\n\r\n\"Florimel!\" said Malcolm solemnly, calling his sister by her name for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n\"You insolent wretch!\" she cried, panting. \"What right have you, if you\r\n_be_, as you say, my base-born brother, to call me by my name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Florimel!\" repeated Malcolm--and the voice was like the voice of her\r\nfather--\"I have done what I could to serve you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I want no more such service,\" she returned, beginning to tremble.\r\n\r\n\"But you have driven me almost to extremities,\" he went on, heedless of\r\nher interruption. \"Beware of doing so quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will nobody take pity on me?\" said Florimel, and looked round\r\nimploringly. Then, finding herself ready to burst into tears, she\r\ngathered all her pride, and stepping up to Malcolm, looked him in the\r\nface, and said, \"Pray, sir, is this house yours or mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine,\" answered Malcolm. \"I am the marquis of Lossie, and while I am\r\nyour elder brother and the head of the family you shall never with my\r\nconsent marry that base man--a man it would blast me to the soul to call\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\nLiftore uttered a fierce imprecation.\r\n\r\n\"If you dare give breath to another such word in my sister's presence I\r\nwill have you gagged,\" said Malcolm.--\"If my sister marries him,\" he\r\ncontinued, turning again to Florimel, \"not one shilling shall she take\r\nwith her beyond what she may happen to have in her purse at the moment.\r\nShe is in my power, and I will use it to the utmost to protect her from\r\nthat man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proof!\" cried Liftore sullenly. But Florimel gazed with pale dilated\r\neyes in the face of the speaker. She knew his words were true. Her soul\r\nassured her of it.\r\n\r\n\"To my sister,\" answered Malcolm, \"I will give all the proof she may\r\nplease to require--to Lord Liftore I will not even repeat my assertion:\r\nto him I will give no shadow of proof. I will but cast him out of my\r\nhouse.--Stoat, order horses for Lady Bellair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gien ye please, sir, my lord,\" replied Stoat, \"the Lossie Airms' horses\r\nis ordered a'ready for Lady Clementina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will my Lady Clementina oblige me by yielding her horses to Lady\r\nBellair?\" said Malcolm, turning to her.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my lord,\" answered Clementina.\r\n\r\n\"You, I trust, my lady,\" said Malcolm, \"will stay a little longer with\r\nmy sister.\"\r\n\r\nLady Bellair came up. \"My lord,\" she said, \"is this the marquis or the\r\nfisherman's way of treating a lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither. But do not drive me to give the rein to my tongue. Let it be\r\nenough to say that my house shall never be what your presence would make\r\nit.\" He turned to the fishermen: \"Three of you take that lord to the\r\ntown-gate, and leave him on the other side of it. His servant shall\r\nfollow as soon as the horses come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go with you,\" said Florimel, crossing to Lady Bellair.\r\n\r\nMalcolm took her by the arm. For one moment she struggled, but, finding\r\nno one dared interfere, submitted, and was led from the room like a\r\nnaughty child.\r\n\r\n\"Keep my lord there till I return,\" he said as he went.\r\n\r\nHe led her into the room which had been her mother's boudoir, and when\r\nhe had shut the door, \"Florimel,\" he said, \"I have striven to serve you\r\nthe best way I knew. Your father, when he confessed me his heir, begged\r\nme to be good to you, and I promised him. Would I have given all these\r\nmonths of my life to the poor labor of a groom, allowed my people to be\r\nwronged and oppressed, my grandfather to be a wanderer, and my best\r\nfriend to sit with his lips of wisdom sealed, but for your sake? I can\r\nhardly say it was for my father's sake, for I should have done the same\r\nhad he never said a word about you. Florimel, I loved my sister, and\r\nlonged for her goodness. But she has foiled all my endeavors. She has\r\nnot loved or followed the truth. She has been proud and disdainful, and\r\ncareless of right. Yourself young and pure, and naturally recoiling from\r\nevil, you have yet cast from you the devotion of a noble, gifted,\r\nlarge-hearted and great-souled man for the miserable preference of the\r\nsmallest, meanest, vilest of men. Nor that only; for with him you have\r\nsided against the woman he most bitterly wrongs, and therein you wrong\r\nthe nature and the God of women. Once more I pray you to give up this\r\nman--to let your true self speak and send him away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I go with my Lady Bellair, driven from my father's house by one\r\nwho calls himself my brother. My lawyer shall make inquiries.\"\r\n\r\nShe would have left the room, but he intercepted her. \"Florimel,\" he\r\nsaid, \"you are casting the pearl of your womanhood before a swine. He\r\nwill trample it under his feet and turn again and rend you. He will\r\ntreat you worse still than poor Lizzy, whom he troubles no more with his\r\npresence.\" He had again taken her arm in his great grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go. You are brutal. I shall scream.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall not go until you have heard all the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! more truth still? Your truth is anything but pleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is more unpleasant yet than you surmise. Florimel, you have driven\r\nme to it. I would have prepared you a shield against the shock which\r\nmust come, but you compel me to wound you to the quick. I would have\r\nhad you receive the bitter truth from lips you loved, but you drove\r\nthose lips of honor from you, and now there are left to utter it only\r\nthe lips you hate. Yet the truth you shall receive: it may help to save\r\nyou from weakness, arrogance and falsehood. Sister, your mother was\r\nnever Lady Lossie.\"\r\n\r\n\"You lie! I know you lie! Because you wrong me, you would brand me with\r\ndishonor, to take from me as well the sympathy of the world. But I defy\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! there is no help, sister. Your mother indeed passed as Lady\r\nLossie, but my mother, the true Lady Lossie, was alive all the time, and\r\nin truth died only last year. For twenty years my mother suffered for\r\nyours. In the eye of the law you are no better than the little child his\r\nfather denied in your presence. Give that man his dismissal, or he will\r\ngive you yours. Never doubt it. Refuse again, and I go from this room to\r\npublish in the next the fact that you are neither Lady Lossie nor Lady\r\nFlorimel Colonsay. You have no right to any name but your mother's. You\r\nare Miss Gordon.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a great gasp at the word, but bravely fought the horror that\r\nwas taking possession of her. She stood with one hand on the back of a\r\nchair, her face white, her eyes starting, her mouth a little open and\r\nrigid--her whole appearance, except for the breath that came short and\r\nquick, that of one who had died in sore pain.\r\n\r\n\"All that is now left you,\" concluded Malcolm, \"is the choice between\r\nsending Liftore away and being abandoned by him. That choice you must\r\nnow make.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor girl tried to speak, but could not. Her fire was burning out,\r\nher forced strength fast failing her.\r\n\r\n\"Florimel,\" said Malcolm, and knelt on one knee and took her hand: it\r\ngave a flutter as if it would fly like a bird, but the net of his love\r\nheld it, and it lay passive and cold--\"Florimel, I will be your true\r\nbrother. I _am_ your brother, your very own brother, to live for you,\r\nlove you, fight for you, watch and ward you, till a true man takes you\r\nfor his wife.\" Her hand quivered like a leaf. \"Sister, when you and I\r\nappear before our father, I shall hold up my face before him: will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Send him away,\" she breathed rather than said, and sank on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe lifted her, laid her on a couch, and returned to the drawing-room.\r\n\"My Lady Clementina,\" he said, \"will you oblige me by going to my sister\r\nin the room at the top of the stair?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, my lord,\" she answered, and went.\r\n\r\nMalcolm walked up to Liftore. \"My lord,\" he said, \"my sister takes her\r\nleave of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have my dismissal from her own lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have it from the hands of my fishermen.--Take him away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear from me, my lord marquis, if such you be,\" said Liftore.\r\n\r\n\"Let it be of your repentance, then, my lord,\" said Malcolm. \"That I\r\nshall be glad to hear of.\"\r\n\r\nAs he turned from him he saw Caley gliding through the little group of\r\nservants toward the door. He walked after her, laid his hand on her\r\nshoulder and whispered a word in her ear. She grew gray rather than\r\nwhite, and stood still.\r\n\r\nTurning again to go to Florimel, he saw the fishermen stopped with their\r\ncharge in the doorway by Mr. Morrison and Mr. Soutar, entering together.\r\n\r\n\"My lord! my lord!\" said the lawyer, coming hastily up to him, \"there\r\ncan surely be no occasion for such--such--measures!\"\r\n\r\nCatching sight of Malcolm's wounded forehead, however, he supplemented\r\nthe remark with a low exclamation of astonishment and dismay--the tone\r\nsaying almost as clearly as words, \"How ill and foolishly everything is\r\nmanaged without a lawyer!\" Malcolm only smiled, and went up to the\r\nmagistrate, whom he led into the middle of the room, saying, \"Mr.\r\nMorrison, every one here knows you: tell them who I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"The marquis of Lossie, my lord,\" answered Mr. Morrison; \"and from my\r\nheart I congratulate your people that at length you assume the rights\r\nand honors of your position.\"\r\n\r\nA murmur of pleasure arose in response. Ere it ceased Malcolm started\r\nand sprung to the door. There stood Lenorme! He seized him by the arm,\r\nand without a word of explanation hurried him to the room where his\r\nsister was. He called Clementina, half drew her from the room, pushed\r\nLenorme in, and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\"Will you meet me on the sandhill at sunset, my lady?\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe smiled assent. He gave her the key of the tunnel, hinted that she\r\nmight leave the two to themselves for a while, and returned to his\r\nfriends in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nHaving begged them to excuse him for a little while, and desired Mrs.\r\nCourthope to serve luncheon for them, he ran to his grandfather,\r\ndreading lest any other tongue than his own should yield him the opened\r\nsecret. He was but just in time, for already the town was in a tumult,\r\nand the spreading ripples of the news were fast approaching Duncan's\r\nears.\r\n\r\nMalcolm found him expectant and restless. When he disclosed himself he\r\nmanifested little astonishment, only took him in his arms and pressed\r\nhim to his bosom, saying, \"Ta Lort pe praised, my son! and she wouldn't\r\npe at aal surprised.\" Then he broke out in a fervent ejaculation of\r\nGaelic, during which he turned instinctively to his pipes, for through\r\nthem lay the final and only sure escape for the prisoned waters of the\r\novercharged reservoir of his feelings. While he played Malcolm slipped\r\nout and hurried to Miss Horn.\r\n\r\nOne word to her was enough. The stern old woman burst into tears,\r\ncrying, \"Oh, my Grisel! my Grisel! Luik doon frae yer bonny hoose amo'\r\nthe stars, an' see the braw laad left ahint ye, an' praise the Lord 'at\r\nye hae sic a son o' yer boady to come hame to ye when a' 's ower.\" She\r\nsobbed and wept for a while without restraint. Then suddenly she rose,\r\ndabbed her eyes indignantly, and cried, \"Hoot! I'm an auld fule. A body\r\nwad think I hed feelin's, efter a'!\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm laughed, and she could not help joining him.\r\n\r\n\"Ye maun come the morn an' chise yer ain room i' the Hoose,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What mean ye by that, laddie?\"\r\n\r\n\"'At ye'll hae to come an' bide wi' me noo.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Deed an' I s' du naething o' the kin', Ma'colm. H'ard ever onybody sic\r\nnonsense? What wad I du wi' Jean? An' I cudna thole men-fowk to wait\r\nupo' me: I wad be clean affrontit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weel, weel! we'll see,\" said Malcolm.\r\n\r\nOn his way back to the House he knocked at Mrs. Catanach's door, and\r\nsaid a few words to her which had a remarkable effect on the expression\r\nof her plump countenance and deep-set black eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home he ran up the main staircase, knocked at the first\r\ndoor, opened it and peeped in. There sat Lenorme on the couch, with\r\nFlorimel on his knees, nestling her head against his shoulder, like a\r\nchild that had been very naughty, but was fully forgiven. Her face was\r\nblotted with her tears, and her hair was everywhere, but there was a\r\nlight of dawning goodness all about her, such as had never shone in her\r\natmosphere before. By what stormy-sweet process the fountain of this\r\nlight had been unsealed no one ever knew but themselves.\r\n\r\nShe did not move when Malcolm entered--more than just to bring the palms\r\nof her hands together and look up in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Have you told him _all_, Florimel?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Malcolm,\" she answered. \"Tell him again yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Florimel: once is enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told him _all_,\" she said with a gasp, then gave a wild little cry,\r\nand, with subdued exultation, added, \"and he _loves_ me yet! He has\r\ntaken the girl without a name to his heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder,\" said Malcolm, \"when she brought it with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lenorme, \"I but took the diamond casket that held my bliss,\r\nand now I could dare the angel Gabriel to match happinesses with me.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Florimel, for all her worldly ways, was but a child. Bad associates\r\nhad filled her with worldly maxims and words and thoughts and\r\njudgments. She had never loved Liftore: she had only taken delight in\r\nhis flatteries. And now had come the shock of a terrible disclosure,\r\nwhose significance she read in remembered looks and tones and behaviors\r\nof the world. Her insolence to Malcolm when she supposed his the\r\nnameless fate had recoiled in lurid interpretation of her own. She was a\r\npariah--without root, without descent, without fathers to whom to be\r\ngathered. She was nobody. From the courted and flattered and high-seated\r\nand powerful, she was a nobody! Then suddenly, to this poor houseless,\r\nwind-beaten, rain-wet nobody, a house--no, a a home she had once looked\r\ninto with longing--had opened, and received her to its heart, that it\r\nmight be fulfilled which was written of old, \"A man shall be as an\r\nhiding-place from the wind and a covert from the tempest.\" Knowing\r\nherself a nobody, she now first began to be a somebody. She had been\r\ndreaming pleasant but bad dreams: she woke, and here was a lovely,\r\nunspeakably blessed and good reality which had been waiting for her all\r\nthe time on the threshold of her sleep. She was baptized into it with\r\nthe tears of sorrow and shame. She had been a fool, but now she knew it,\r\nand was going to be wise.\r\n\r\n\"Will you come to your brother, Florimel?\" said Malcolm tenderly,\r\nholding out his arms.\r\n\r\nLenorme raised her. She went softly to him and laid herself on his\r\nbosom. \"Forgive me, brother,\" she said, and held up her face.\r\n\r\nHe kissed her forehead and lips, took her in his arms and laid her again\r\non Lenorme's knees.\r\n\r\n\"I give her to _you_,\" he said, \"for you are good.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he left them, and sought Mr. Morrison and Mr. Soutar, who were\r\nwaiting him over a glass of wine after their lunch. An hour of business\r\nfollowed, in which, amongst other matters, they talked about the needful\r\narrangements for a dinner to his people, fishers and farmers and all.\r\nAfter the gentlemen took their leave nobody saw him for hours. Till\r\nsunset approached he remained alone, shut up in the Wizard's Chamber,\r\nthe room in which he was born. Part of the time he occupied in writing\r\nto Mr. Graham.\r\n\r\nAs the sun's orbed furnace fell behind the tumbling waters, Malcolm\r\nturned his face inland from the wet strip of shining shore on which he\r\nhad been pacing, and ascended the sandhill. From the other side\r\nClementina but a moment later ascended also. On the top they met in the\r\nred light of the sunset. They clasped each other's hand, and stood for a\r\nmoment in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my lord,\" said the lady, \"how shall I thank you that you kept your\r\nsecret from me? But my heart is sore to lose my fisherman.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lady,\" returned Malcolm, \"you have not lost your fisherman: you have\r\nonly found your groom.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the sun went down, and the twilight came, and the night followed,\r\nand the world of sea and land and wind and vapor was around them, and\r\nthe universe of stars and spaces over and under them, and eternity\r\nwithin them, and the heart of each for a chamber to the other, and God\r\nfilling all--nay, nay, God's heart containing, infolding, cherishing\r\nall, saving all, from height to height of intensest being, by the bliss\r\nof that love whose absolute devotion could utter itself only in death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Duncan in full dress, claymore and dirk at his sides\r\nand carrying the great Lossie pipes, marched first through the streets\r\nof the upper, then through the closes of the lower, town, followed by\r\nthe bellman, who had been appointed crier upon his disappearance. At the\r\nproper stations Duncan blew a rousing pibroch, after which the bellman,\r\nwho, for the dignity of his calling, insisted on a prelude of three\r\nstrokes of his clapper, proclaimed aloud that Malcolm, marquis of\r\nLossie, desired the presence of each and every of his tenants in the\r\nroyal burgh of Portlossie, Newton and Seaton, in the town-hall of the\r\nsame, at seven of the clock upon the evening next following. The\r\nproclamation ended, the piper sounded one note three times, and they\r\npassed to the next station. When they had gone through the Seaton they\r\nentered a carriage waiting for them at the sea-gate, and were driven to\r\nScaurnose, and thence again to the several other villages on the coast\r\nbelonging to the marquis, making at each in like manner the same\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\nPortlossie was in a ferment of wonder, satisfaction and pleasure. There\r\nwere few in it who were not glad at the accession of Malcolm, and with\r\nevery one of those few the cause lay in himself. In the shops, among the\r\nnets, in the curing-sheds, in the houses and cottages, nothing else was\r\ntalked about; and stories and reminiscences innumerable were brought\r\nout, chiefly to prove that Malcolm had always appeared likely to turn\r\nout somebody, the narrator not seldom modestly hinting at a glimmering\r\nforesight on his own part of what had now been at length revealed to the\r\nworld. His friends were jubilant as revellers. For Meg Partan, she ran\r\nfrom house to house like a maniac, laughing and crying. It was as if the\r\nwhole Seaton had suddenly been translated. The men came crowding about\r\nDuncan, congratulating him and asking him a hundred questions. But the\r\nold man maintained a reticence whose dignity was strangely mingled of\r\npomp and grace; sat calm and stately, as feeling the glow of reflected\r\nhonor; would not, by word, gesture, tone or exclamation, confess to any\r\nsurprise; behaved as if he had known it all the time; made no pretence,\r\nhowever, of having known it--merely treated the fact as not a whit more\r\nthan might have been looked for by one who had known Malcolm as he had\r\nknown him.\r\n\r\nDavy, in his yacht uniform, was the next morning appointed the marquis's\r\npersonal attendant, and a running time he had of it for a fortnight.\r\nAlmost the first thing that fell to him in his office was to show into\r\nthe room on the ground floor where his master sat--the same in which for\r\nages the lords of Lossie had been wont to transact what little business\r\nany of them ever attended to--a pale, feeble man, bowed by the weight of\r\na huge brass-clasped volume under each arm.\r\n\r\nHis lordship rose and met him with outstretched hand. \"I am glad indeed\r\nto see you, Mr. Crathie,\" he said, \"but I fear you are out too soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite well since yesterday, my lord,\" returned the factor, his\r\nface shining with pleasure. \"Your lordship's accession has made a young\r\nman of me again. Here I am to render account of my stewardship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want none, Mr. Crathie--nothing, that is, beyond a summary statement\r\nof how things stand with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to satisfy your lordship that I have dealt\r\nhonestly\"--here the factor paused for a moment, then with an effort\r\nadded--\"by _you_, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word,\" said Malcolm--\"the last of the sort, I believe, that will\r\never pass between us. Thank God we had made it up before yesterday! If\r\nyou have ever been hard upon any of my tenants, not to say unfair, you\r\nhave wronged me infinitely more than if you had taken from me. God be\r\nwith me as I prefer ruin to wrong! Remember, besides, that my tenants\r\nare my charge and care. For you, my representative, therefore, to do one\r\nof them an injury is to do me a double injury--to wrong my tenant, and\r\nto wrong him in my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my lord, you don't know how they would take advantage of you if\r\nthere were nobody to look after your interests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do look after them, sir. It would be bad for them to succeed, as\r\nwell as crippling to me. Only be sure, with the thought of the righteous\r\nGod to elevate your sense of justice, that you are in the right. If\r\ndoubtful, then give in. And now, if any man thinks he has cause of\r\ncomplaint, I leave it to you, with the help of the new light that has\r\nbeen given you, to reconsider the matter, and where needful to make\r\nreparation. You must be the friend of my tenant as much as of his\r\nlandlord. I have no interests inimical to those of my tenants. If any\r\nman comes to me with complaint, I will send him to re-state his case to\r\nyou, with the understanding that if you will not listen to him he is to\r\ncome to me again, when I shall hear both sides and judge between. If\r\nafter six months you should desire me to go over the books with you, I\r\nwill do so. As to your loyalty to my family and its affairs, of that I\r\nnever had a shadow of suspicion.\" As he ended Malcolm held out his hand.\r\n\r\nThe factor's trembled in his strong grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Mistress Crathie is sorely vexed, my lord,\" he said, rising to take his\r\nleave, \"at things both said and done in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm laughed. \"Give Mrs. Crathie my compliments,\" he said, \"and tell\r\nher a man is more than a marquis. If she will after this treat every\r\nhonest fisherman as if he might possibly turn out a lord, she and I\r\nshall be more than quits.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning he carried her again a few mackerel he had just caught,\r\nand she never forgot the lesson given her. That morning, I may mention,\r\nhe did not go fishing alone, but had a lady with him in the dinghy; and\r\nindeed they were together, in one place and another, the most of the\r\nday--at one time flying along the fields, she on the bay mare and he on\r\nKelpie.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening came the town-hall was crammed--men standing on all the\r\nwindow-sills--and so many could not get in that Malcolm proposed they\r\nshould occupy the square in front. A fisherman in garb and gesture, not\r\nthe less a gentleman and a marquis, he stood on the steps of the\r\ntown-hall and spoke to his people. They received him with wild\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"The open air is better for everything,\" he began. \"Fishers, I have\r\ncalled you first, because you are my own people. I am and shall be a\r\nfisherman--after such fashion, I trust, as will content my old comrades.\r\nHow things have come about I shall not now tell you. Come, all of you,\r\nand dine with me, and you shall hear enough to satisfy at least lawful\r\ncuriosity. At present my care is that you should understand the terms\r\nupon which it is possible for us to live together as friends. I make no\r\nallusion to personal friendships. A true friend is for ever a friend.\r\nAnd I venture to say my old friends know best both what I am and what I\r\nshall be. As to them, I have no shadow of anxiety. But I would gladly be\r\na friend to all, and will do my endeavor to that end.\r\n\r\n\"You of Portlossie shall have your harbor cleared without delay.\"\r\n\r\nIn justice to the fishers I here interrupt my report to state that the\r\nvery next day they set about clearing the harbor themselves. It was\r\ntheir business--in part, at least, they said--and they were ashamed of\r\nhaving left it so long. This did much toward starting well for a new\r\norder of things.\r\n\r\n\"You of Scaurnose shall hear the blasting necessary for your harbor\r\ncommence within a fortnight; and every house shall ere long have a small\r\npiece of land at a reasonable rate allotted it. But I feel bound to\r\nmention that there are some among you upon whom, until I see that they\r\ncarry themselves differently, I must keep an eye. That they have shown\r\nthemselves unfriendly to myself, in my attempts to persuade them to what\r\nthey knew to be right, I shall endeavor to forget, but I give them\r\nwarning that whoever shall hereafter disturb the peace or interfere with\r\nthe liberty of my people shall assuredly be cast out of my borders, and\r\nthat as soon as the law will permit.\r\n\r\n\"I shall take measures that all complaints shall be heard, and all save\r\nfoolish ones heeded; for, as much as in me lies, I will to execute\r\njustice and judgment and righteousness in the land. Whoever oppresses or\r\nwrongs his neighbor shall have to do with me. And to aid me in doing\r\njustice I pray the help of every honest man. I have not been so long\r\namong you without having in some measure distinguished between the men\r\nwho have heart and brain, and the men who have merely a sense of their\r\nown importance; which latter class, unhappily, always takes itself for\r\nthe former. I will deal with every man as I find him. I am set to rule,\r\nand rule I will. He who loves righteousness will help me to rule: he\r\nwho loves it not shall be ruled or depart.\"\r\n\r\nThe address had been every now and than interrupted by a hearty cheer:\r\nat this point the cheering was greatly prolonged: after it there was no\r\nmore. For thus he went on:\r\n\r\n\"And now I am about to give you proof that I mean what I say, and that\r\nevil shall not come to the light without being noted and dealt with.\r\n\r\n\"There are in this company two women--my eyes are at this moment upon\r\nthem where they stand together. One of them is already well known to you\r\nall by sight: now you shall know, not what she looks, but what she is.\r\nHer name, or at least that by which she goes among you, is Barbara\r\nCatanach. The other is an Englishwoman, of whom you know nothing. Her\r\nname is Caley.\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned upon the two. Even Mrs. Catanach was cowed by the\r\nconsciousness of the universal stare, and a kind of numb thrill went\r\nthrough her from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Well assured that if I brought a criminal action against them it would\r\nhang them both, I trust you will not imagine it revenge that moves me\r\nthus to expose them. In refraining from prosecuting them I bind myself\r\nof necessity to see that they work no more evil. In giving them time for\r\nrepentance I take the consequences upon myself. I am bound to take care\r\nthat they do not employ the respite in doing mischief to their\r\nneighbors. Without precaution I could not be justified in sparing them.\r\nTherefore those women shall not go forth to pass for harmless members of\r\nsociety, and see the life and honor of others lie bare to their secret\r\nattack. They shall live _here_, in this town, thoroughly known and\r\nabsolutely distrusted. And that they may thus be known and distrusted, I\r\npublicly declare that I hold proof against these women of having\r\nconspired to kill me. From the effects of the poison they succeeded in\r\ngiving me I fear I shall never altogether recover. I can prove also, to\r\nthe extreme of circumstantial evidence, that there is the blood of one\r\nchild at least upon the hands of each; and that there are mischiefs\r\ninnumerable upon their lying tongues it were an easy task to convince\r\nyou. If I wrong them, let them accuse me, and whether they lose or gain\r\ntheir suit, I promise, before you for witnesses, I will pay all; only\r\nthereby they will compel me to bring my actions for murder and\r\nconspiracy. Let them choose.\r\n\r\n\"Hear what I have determined concerning them. The woman Catanach shall\r\ntake to her cottage the woman Caley. That cottage they shall have rent\r\nfree: who could receive money from such hands? I will appoint them also\r\na sufficiency for life and maintenance, bare indeed, for I would not\r\nhave them comfortable. But they shall be free to work if they can find\r\nany to employ them. If, however, either shall go beyond the bounds I set\r\nshe shall be followed the moment she is missed, and that with a warrant\r\nfor her apprehension. And I beg all honest people to keep an eye upon\r\nthem. According as they live shall their life be. If they come to\r\nrepentance, they will bless the day I resolved upon such severe measures\r\non their behalf. Let them go to their place.\"\r\n\r\nI will not try to describe the devilish look, mingled of contempt and\r\nhate, that possessed the countenance of the midwife as, with head erect\r\nand eyes looking straight before her, she obeyed the command. Caley,\r\nwhite as death, trembled and tottered, nor dared once look up as she\r\nfollowed her companion to their appointed hell. Whether they made it\r\npleasant for each other my reader may debate with himself. Before many\r\nmonths had gone by, stared at and shunned by all, even by Miss Horn's\r\nJean, driven back upon her own memories, and the pictures that rose out\r\nof them, and deprived of every chance of indulging her dominant passion\r\nfor mischievous influence, the midwife's face told such a different tale\r\nthat the schoolmaster began to cherish a feeble hope that within a few\r\nyears Mrs. Catanach might get so far as to begin to suspect that she was\r\na sinner--that she had actually done things she ought not to have done.\r\nOne of those things that same night Malcolm heard from the lips of\r\nDuncan--a tale of horror and dismay. Not until then did he know, after\r\nall he knew concerning her, what the woman was capable of.\r\n\r\nAt his own entreaty, Duncan was formally recognized as piper to the\r\nmarquis of Lossie. His ambition reached no higher. Malcolm himself saw\r\nto his perfect equipment, heedful specially that his kilt and plaid\r\nshould be of Duncan's own tartan of red and blue and green. His dirk and\r\nbroadsword he had new sheathed, with silver mountings. A great silver\r\nbrooch with a big cairngorm in the centre took the place of the brass\r\none, which henceforth was laid up among the precious things in the\r\nlittle armory, and the badge of his clan in gold, with rubies and\r\namethysts for the bells of the heather, glowed on his bonnet. And\r\nMalcolm's guests, as long as Duncan continued able to fill the bag, had\r\nto endure as best they might, between each course at every dinner\r\nwithout fail, two or three minutes of uproar and outcry from the treble\r\nthroat of the powerful Lossie pipes. By his own desire, the piper had a\r\nchair and small table set for him behind and to the right of his chief,\r\nas he called him: there he ate with the family and guests, waited upon\r\nby Davy, part of whose business it was to hand him the pipes at the\r\nproper moment, whereupon he rose to his feet--for even he with all his\r\nexperience and habitude was unable in a sitting posture to keep that\r\nstand of pipes full of wind--and raised such a storm of sound as made\r\nthe windows tremble. A lady guest would now and then venture to hint\r\nthat the custom was rather a trying one for English ears, but Clementina\r\nwould never listen to a breath against Duncan's music. Her respect and\r\naffection for the old man were unbounded.\r\n\r\nMalcolm was one of the few who understand the shelter of light, the\r\nprotection to be gained against lying tongues by the discarding of\r\nneedless reticence and the open presentation of the truth. Many men\r\nwould not tell a lie, yet seem to have faith in concealment; they would\r\nrather not reveal the truth; darkness seems to offer them the cover of a\r\nfriendly wing. But there is no veil like light--no adamantine armor\r\nagainst hurt like the truth. To Malcolm it was one of the promises of\r\nthe kingdom that there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed. He\r\nwas anxious, therefore, to tell his people at the coming dinner the main\r\npoints of his story, and certain that such openness would also help to\r\nlay the foundation of confidence between him and his people. The one\r\ndifficulty in the way was the position of Florimel. But that could not\r\nfail to appear in any case, and he was satisfied that even for her sake\r\nit was far better to speak openly; for then the common heart would take\r\nher in and cover her. He consulted, therefore, with Lenorme, who went to\r\nfind her. She came, threw her arms round his neck, and begged him to say\r\nwhatever he thought best.\r\n\r\nTo add the final tinge to the rainbow of Malcolm's joy, on the morning\r\nof the dinner the schoolmaster arrived. It would be hard to say whether\r\nMalcolm or Clementina was the more delighted to see him. He said little\r\nwith his tongue, but much with his eyes and face and presence.\r\n\r\nThis time the tables were not set in different parts of the grounds, but\r\ngathered upon the level of the drive and the adjacent lawny spaces\r\nbetween the house and the trees. Malcolm, in full Highland dress as\r\nchief of his clan, took the head of the central table, with Florimel in\r\nthe place of honor at his right hand and Clementina on his left. Lenorme\r\nsat next to Florimel, and Annie Mair next to Lenorme. On the other side,\r\nMr. Graham sat next to Clementina, Miss Horn next to Mr. Graham, and\r\nBlue Peter next to Miss Horn. Except Mr. Morrison, he had asked none who\r\nwere not his tenants or servants, or in some way connected with the\r\nestates, except indeed a few whom he counted old friends, amongst them\r\nsome aged beggar-folk waiting their summons to Abraham's bosom; in which\r\nthere was no such exceptional virtue on the marquis's part, for, the\r\npoor law not having yet invaded Scotland, a man was not without the\r\nrespect of his neighbors merely because he was a pauper. He set Mr.\r\nMorrison to preside at the farmers' tables, and had all the fisher-folk\r\nabout himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the main part of the dinner was over, he rose, and with as much\r\ncircumstance as he thought desirable told his story, beginning with the\r\nparts in it his uncle and Mrs. Catanach had taken. It was, however, he\r\nsaid, a principle in the history of the world that evil should bring\r\nforth good, and his poor little cockboat had been set adrift upon an\r\nocean of blessing. For had he not been taken to the heart of one of the\r\nnoblest and simplest of men, who had brought him up in honorable poverty\r\nand rectitude? When he had said this he turned to Duncan, who sat at his\r\nown table behind him with his pipes on a stool covered with a rich cloth\r\nby his side. \"You all know my grandfather,\" he went on, \"and you all\r\nrespect him.\"\r\n\r\nAt this rose a great shout.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, my friends,\" he continued. \"My desire is that every soul\r\nupon land of mine should carry himself to Duncan MacPhail as if he were\r\nin blood that which he is in deed and in truth--my grandfather.\"\r\n\r\nA second great shout arose, which wavered and sank when they saw the old\r\nman bow his head upon his hands.\r\n\r\nHe went on to speak of the privileges he alone of all his race had ever\r\nenjoyed--the privileges of toil and danger, with all their experiences\r\nof human dependence and divine aid; the privilege of the confidence and\r\ncompanionship of honorable laboring men, and the understanding of their\r\nways and thoughts and feelings; and, above all, the privilege of the\r\nfriendship and instruction of the schoolmaster, to whom he owed more\r\nthan eternity could reveal.\r\n\r\nThen he turned again to his narrative, and told how his father, falsely\r\ninformed that his wife and child were dead, married Florimel's mother;\r\nhow his mother, out of compassion for both of them, held her peace; how\r\nfor twenty years she had lived with her cousin, Miss Horn, and held her\r\npeace even from her; how at last, when, having succeeded to the\r\nproperty, she heard he was coming to the House, the thought of his\r\nnearness, yet unapproachableness--in this way at least he, the child of\r\nboth, interpreted the result--so worked upon a worn and enfeebled frame\r\nthat she died.\r\n\r\nThen he told how Miss Horn, after his mother's death, came upon letters\r\nrevealing the secret which she had all along known must exist, but after\r\nwhich, from love and respect for her cousin, she had never inquired.\r\n\r\nLast of all, he told how, in a paroxysm of rage, Mrs. Catanach had let\r\nthe secret of his birth escape her; how she had afterward made affidavit\r\nconcerning it; and how his father had upon his deathbed, with all\r\nnecessary legal observances, acknowledged him his son and heir.\r\n\r\n\"And now, to the mighty gladness of my soul,\" he said, looking on\r\nFlorimel at his side, \"my dearly-loved and honored sister--loved and\r\nhonored long before I knew she was my own--has accepted me as her\r\nbrother, and I do not think she greatly regrets the loss of the headship\r\nof the house which she has passed over to me. She will lose little else.\r\nAnd of all women, it may well be to her a small matter to lose a mere\r\ntitle, seeing she is so soon to change her name for one which will bring\r\nher honor of a more enduring reality. For he who is about to become her\r\nhusband is not only one of the noblest of men, but a man of genius whose\r\npraises she will hear on all sides. One of his works, the labor and gift\r\nof love, you shall see when we rise from the table. It is a portrait of\r\nyour late landlord, my father, painted partly from a miniature, partly\r\nfrom my sister, partly from the portraits of the family, and partly, I\r\nam happy to think, from myself. You must yourselves judge of the truth\r\nof it. And you will remember that Mr. Lenorme never saw my father: I say\r\nthis, not to excuse, but to enhance his work.\r\n\r\n\"My tenants, I will do my best to give you fair play. My friend and\r\nfactor, Mr. Crathie, has confided to me his doubts whether he may not\r\nhave been a little hard: he is prepared to reconsider some of your\r\ncases. Do not imagine that I am going to be a careless man of business.\r\nI want money, for I have enough to do with it, if only to set right\r\nmuch that is wrong. But let God judge between you and me.\r\n\r\n\"My fishermen, every honest man of you is my friend, and you shall know\r\nit. Between you and me that is enough. But for the sake of harmony and\r\nright and order, and that I may keep near you, I shall appoint three men\r\nof yourselves in each village to whom any man or woman may go with\r\nrequest or complaint. If two of those three men judge the matter fit to\r\nrefer to me, the probability is that I shall see it as they do. If any\r\nman think them scant of justice toward him, let him come to me. Should I\r\nfind myself in doubt, I have here at my side my loved and honored master\r\nto whom to apply for counsel, knowing that what oracle he may utter I\r\nshall receive straight from the innermost parts of a temple of the Holy\r\nGhost. Friends, if we be honest with ourselves, we shall be honest with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\"And, in conclusion, why should you hear from any lips but my own that\r\nthis lady beside me, the daughter of an English earl of ancient house,\r\nhas honored the house of Lossie by consenting to become its marchioness?\r\nLady Clementina Thornicroft possesses large estates in the south of\r\nEngland, but not for them did I seek her favor, as you will be convinced\r\nwhen you reflect what the fact involves which she has herself desired me\r\nto make known to you--namely, that it was while yet she was unacquainted\r\nwith my birth and position, and had never dreamed that I was other than\r\nonly a fisherman and a groom, that she accepted me for her husband. I\r\nthank my God!\"\r\n\r\nWith that he took his seat, and after hearty cheering, a glass or two of\r\nwine and several speeches, all rose and went to look at the portrait of\r\nthe late marquis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nKNOTTED STRANDS.\r\n\r\nLady Clementina had to return to England to see her lawyers and arrange\r\nher affairs. Before she went she would gladly have gone with Malcolm\r\nover every spot where had passed any portion of his history, and at each\r\nheard its own chapter or paragraph; but Malcolm obstinately refused to\r\nbegin such a narration before Clementina was mistress of the region to\r\nwhich it mainly belonged. After that, he said, he would, even more\r\ngladly, he believed, than she, occupy all the time that could be spared\r\nfrom the duties of the present in piecing together the broken\r\nreflections of the past in the pools of memory until they had lived both\r\ntheir lives over again together, from earliest recollection to the time\r\nwhen the two streams flowed into one, thenceforth to mingle more and\r\nmore inwardly to endless ages.\r\n\r\nSo the Psyche was launched: Lady Clementina, Florimel and Lenorme were\r\nthe passengers, and Malcolm, Blue Peter and Davy the crew. There was no\r\nroom for servants, yet was there no lack of service. They had rough\r\nweather a part of the time, and neither Clementina nor Lenorme was\r\naltogether comfortable, but they made a rapid voyage, and were all well\r\nwhen they landed at Greenwich.\r\n\r\nKnowing nothing of Lady Bellair's proceedings, they sent Davy to\r\nreconnoitre in Portland Place. He brought back word that there was no\r\none in the house but an old woman. So Malcolm took Florimel there.\r\nEverything belonging to their late visitors had vanished, and nobody\r\nknew where they had gone.\r\n\r\nSearching the drawers and cabinets, Malcolm, to his unspeakable delight,\r\nfound a miniature of his mother, along with one of his father--a younger\r\nlikeness than he had yet seen. Also he found a few letters of his\r\nmother--mostly mere notes in pencil--but neither these nor those of his\r\nfather which Miss Horn had given him would he read. \"What right has life\r\nover the secrets of death?\" he said. \"Or, rather, what right have we who\r\nsleep over the secrets of those who have waked from their sleep and left\r\nthe fragments of their dreams behind them?\" Lovingly he laid them\r\ntogether and burned them to dust-flakes. \"My mother shall tell me what\r\nshe pleases when I find her,\" he said. \"She shall not reprove me for\r\nreading her letters to my father.\"\r\n\r\nThey were married at Wastbeach, both couples in the same ceremony.\r\nImmediately after the wedding the painter and his bride set out for\r\nRome, and the marquis and marchioness went on board the Psyche. For\r\nnothing would content Clementina, troubled at the experience of her\r\nfirst voyage, but she must get herself accustomed to the sea, as became\r\nthe wife of a fisherman: therefore in no way would she journey but on\r\nboard the Psyche; and as it was the desire of each to begin their\r\nmarried life at home, they sailed direct for Portlossie. After a good\r\nvoyage, however, they landed, in order to reach home quietly, at Duff\r\nHarbor, took horses from there, and arrived at Lossie House late in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nMalcolm had written to the housekeeper to prepare for them the Wizard's\r\nChamber, but to alter nothing on walls or in furniture. That room, he\r\nhad resolved, should be the first he occupied with his bride. Mrs.\r\nCourthope was scandalized at the idea of taking an earl's daughter to\r\nsleep in the garret, not to mention that the room had for centuries had\r\nan ill name; but she had no choice, and therefore contented herself with\r\ndoing all that lay in the power of woman, under such severe\r\nrestrictions, to make the dingy old room cheerful.\r\n\r\nAlone at length in their somewhat strange quarters--concerning which\r\nMalcolm had merely told her that the room was that in which he was\r\nborn--what place fitter, thought Clementina, wherein to commence the\r\nlong and wonderful story she hungered to hear? Malcolm would still have\r\ndelayed it, but she asked question upon question till she had him fairly\r\nafloat. He had not gone far, however, before he had to make mention of\r\nthe stair in the wall, which led from the place where they sat straight\r\nfrom the house.\r\n\r\n\"Can there be such a stair to this room?\" she asked in surprise.\r\n\r\nHe rose took a candle, opened a door, then another, and showed her the\r\nfirst of the steps down which the midwife had carried him, and\r\ndescending which, twenty years after, his father had come by his death.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go down,\" said Clementina.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not afraid? Look!\" said Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\"Afraid, and you with me!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"But it is dark, and the steps are broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it led to Hades I would go with my fisherman. The only horror would\r\nbe to be left behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then,\" said Malcolm; \"only you must be very careful.\"\r\n\r\nHe laid a shawl on her shoulders, and down they went, Malcolm a few\r\nsteps in front, holding the candle to every step for her, many being\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nThey came at length where the stair ceased in ruin. He leaped down: she\r\nstooped, put her hands on his shoulders and dropped into his arms. Then\r\nover the fallen rubbish, out by the groaning door, they went into the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nClementina was merry as a child. All was so safe and peaceful with her\r\nfisherman! She would not hear of returning: they must have a walk in the\r\nmoonlight first. So down the steps and the winding path into the valley\r\nof the burn, and up to the flower-garden, they wandered, Clementina\r\ntelling him how sick the moonlight had made her feel that night she met\r\nhim first on the Boar's Tail, when his words concerning her revived the\r\nconviction that he loved Florimel. At the great stone basin Malcolm set\r\nthe swan spouting, but the sweet musical jargon of the falling water\r\nseemed almost coarse in the soundless diapason of the moonlight. So he\r\nstopped it again, and they strolled farther up the garden.\r\n\r\nClementina venturing to remind him of the sexton-like gardener's story\r\nof the lady and the hermit's cave, which, because of its Scotch, she was\r\nunable to follow, Malcolm told her now what John Jack had narrated,\r\nadding that the lady was his own mother, and that from the gardener's\r\ntale he learned that morning at length how to account for the horror\r\nwhich had seized him on his first entering the cave, as also for his\r\nfather's peculiar carriage on that occasion: doubtless he then caught a\r\nlikeness in him to his mother. He then recounted the occurrence\r\ncircumstantially.\r\n\r\n\"I have ever since felt ashamed of the weakness,\" he concluded; \"but at\r\nthis moment I believe I could walk in with perfect coolness.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't try it to-night,\" said Clementina, and once more turned him\r\nfrom the place, reverencing the shadow he had brought with him from the\r\nspirit of his mother.\r\n\r\nThey walked and sat and talked in the moonlight, for how long neither\r\nknew; and when the moon went behind the trees on the cliff, and the\r\nvalley was left in darkness, but a darkness that seemed alive with the\r\nnew day soon to be born, they sat yet, lost in a peaceful unveiling of\r\nhearts, till a sudden gust of wind roused Malcolm, and looking up he saw\r\nthat the stars were clouded, and knew that the chill of the morning was\r\ndrawing near.\r\n\r\nHe kept that chamber just as it was ever after, and often retired to it\r\nfor meditation. He never restored the ruinous parts of the stair, and he\r\nkept the door at the top carefully closed. But he cleared out the\r\nrubbish that choked the place where the stair had led lower down, came\r\nupon it again in tolerable preservation a little beneath, and followed\r\nit into a passage that ran under the burn, appearing to lead in the\r\ndirection of the cave behind the Baillies' Barn. Doubtless there was\r\nsome foundation for the legend of Lord Gernon.\r\n\r\nThere, however, he abandoned the work, thinking of the possibility of a\r\ntime when employment would be scarce and his people in want of all he\r\ncould give them. And when such a time arrived, as arrive it did before\r\nthey had been two years married, a far more important undertaking was\r\nfound needful to employ the many who must earn or starve. Then it was\r\nthat Clementina had the desire of her heart, and began to lay out the\r\nmoney she had been saving for the purpose in rebuilding the ancient\r\ncastle of Colonsay. Its vaults were emptied of rubbish and ruin, the\r\nrock faced afresh, walls and towers and battlements raised, until at\r\nlast, when the loftiest tower seemed to have reached its height, it rose\r\nyet higher and blossomed in radiance; for, top-most crown of all, there,\r\nflaming far into the northern night, shone a splendid beacon-lamp to\r\nguide the fisherman when his way was hid. Every summer for years\r\nFlorimel and her husband spent weeks in the castle, and many a study the\r\npainter made there of the ever-changing face of the sea.\r\n\r\nMalcolm, as he well might, had such a strong feeling of the power for\r\ngood of every high-souled schoolmaster that nothing would serve him but\r\nMr. Graham must be reinstated. He told the presbytery that if it were\r\nnot done he would himself build a school-house for him, and the\r\nconsequence, he said, needed no prediction. Finding, at the same time,\r\nthat the young man they had put in his place was willing to act as his\r\nassistant, he proposed that he should keep the cottage and all other\r\nemoluments of the office, on the sole condition that when he found he\r\ncould no longer conscientiously and heartily further the endeavors of\r\nMr. Graham he should say so; whereupon the marquis would endeavor to\r\nprocure him another appointment; and on these understandings the thing\r\nwas arranged.\r\n\r\nMr. Graham thenceforward lived in the House, a spiritual father to the\r\nwhole family, reverenced by all, ever greeted with gladness, ever\r\nobeyed. The spiritual dignity and simplicity, the fine sense and\r\ndelicate feeling of the man, rendered him a saving presence in the\r\nplace; and Clementina felt as if one of the ancient prophets, blossomed\r\ninto a Christian, was the glory of their family and house. Like a\r\nperfect daughter she watched him, tried to discover preferences of which\r\nhe might not himself be aware, and often waited upon him with her own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThere was an ancient building connected with the house, divided now for\r\nmany years into barn and dairy, but evidently the chapel of the\r\nmonastery: this Malcolm soon set about reconverting. It made a lovely\r\nchapel--too large for the household, but not too large for its\r\ncongregation upon Wednesday evenings, when many of the fishermen and\r\ntheir families, and not a few of the inhabitants of the upper town,\r\nwith occasionally several farm-servants from the neighborhood, assembled\r\nto listen devoutly to the fervent and loving expostulations and\r\nrousings, or the tender consolings and wise instructions, of the\r\n_master_, as every one called him. The hold he had of their hearts was\r\nfirm, and his influence on their consciences far reaching.\r\n\r\nWhen there was need of conference or ground for any wide expostulation\r\nthe marquis would call a meeting in the chapel; but this occurred very\r\nseldom. Now and then the master, sometimes the marquis himself, would\r\nuse it for a course of lectures or a succession of readings from some\r\nspecially interesting book; and in what had been the sacristy they\r\ngathered a small library for the use of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nNo meeting was held there of a Sunday, for although the clergyman was\r\nthe one person to whom all his life the marquis never came any nearer,\r\nhe was not the less careful to avoid everything that might rouse\r\ncontention or encourage division. \"I find the doing of the will of God,\"\r\nhe would say, \"leaves me no time for disputing about His plans--I do not\r\nsay for thinking about them.\" Not, therefore, however, would he waive\r\nthe exercise of the inborn right of teaching, and anybody might come to\r\nthe house and see the master on Sunday evenings. As to whether people\r\nwent to church or stayed away, he never troubled himself in the least;\r\nand no more did the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nThe chapel had not been long finished when he had an organ built in it.\r\nLady Lossie played upon it. Almost every evening, at a certain hour, she\r\nplayed for a while: the door was always open, and any one who pleased\r\nmight sit down and listen. Gradually the feeling of the community, from\r\nthe strengthening and concentrating influence of the House, began to\r\nbear upon offenders; and any whose conduct had become in the least\r\nflagrant soon felt that the general eye was upon them, and that\r\ngradually the human tide was falling from them, and leaving them\r\nprisoned in a rocky basin on a barren shore. But at the same time, all\r\nthree of the powers at the House were watching to come in the moment\r\nthere was a chance; and what with the marquis's warnings, his wife's\r\nencouragements and the master's expostulations there was no little hope\r\nof the final recovery of several who would otherwise most likely have\r\nsunk deeper and deeper.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness took Lizzy for her personal attendant, and had her boy\r\nmuch about her; so that by the time she had children of her own she had\r\nsome genuine and worthy notion of what a child was, and what could and\r\nought to be done for the development of the divine germ that lay in the\r\nhuman egg, and had found that the best she could do for any child, or\r\nindeed anybody, was to be good herself.\r\n\r\nRose married a young fisherman, and made a brave wife and mother. To the\r\nend of her days she regarded the marquis almost as a being higher than\r\nhuman, an angel that had found and saved her.\r\n\r\nKelpie had a foal, and, apparently in consequence, grew so much more\r\ngentle that at length Malcolm consented that Clementina, who was an\r\nexcellent horsewoman, should mount her. After a few attempts to unseat\r\nher, not of the most determined kind, however, Kelpie, on her part,\r\nconsented to carry her, and ever after seemed proud of having a mistress\r\nthat could ride. Her foal turned out a magnificent horse. Malcolm did\r\nnot allow him to do anything that could be called work before he was\r\neight years old, and had the return at the other end, for when Goblin\r\nwas thirty he rode him still, and, to judge by appearances, might but\r\nfor an accident have ridden him ten years more.\r\n\r\nIt was not long ere people began to remark that no one now ever heard\r\nthe piper utter the name _Campbell_. An ill-bred youth once--it was well\r\nfor him that Malcolm was not near--dared the evil word in his presence:\r\na cloud swept across the old man's face, but he held his peace, and to\r\nthe day of his death, which arrived in his ninety-first year, it never\r\ncrossed his lips. He died with the Lossie pipes on his bed, Malcolm on\r\none side of him and Clementina on the other.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers may care to know that Phemy and Davy were married,\r\nand made the quaintest, oldest-fashioned little couple, with hearts\r\nwhich king and beggar might equally have trusted.\r\n\r\nMalcolm's relations with the fisher-folk, founded as they were in truth\r\nand open uprightness, were not in the least injured by his change of\r\nposition. He made it a point to be always at home during the\r\nherring-fishing. Whatever might be going on in London, the marquis and\r\nmarchioness, their family and household, were sure to leave in time for\r\nthe commencement of that. Those who admired Malcolm--of whom there were\r\nnot a few even in Vanity Fair--called him the fisher-king: the wags\r\ncalled him the kingfisher, and laughed at the oddity of his taste in\r\npreferring what he called his duty to the pleasures of the season. But\r\nthe marquis found even the hen-pecked Partan a nobler and more elevating\r\npresence than any strutting platitude of Bond street. And when he was at\r\nhome he was always about amongst the people. Almost every day he would\r\nlook in at some door in the Seaton, and call out a salutation to the\r\nbusy house-wife--perhaps go in and sit down for a minute. Now he would\r\nbe walking with this one, now talking with that--oftenest with Blue\r\nPeter; and sometimes both their wives would be with them upon the shore\r\nor in the grounds. Nor was there a family meal to which any one or all\r\ntogether of the six men whom he had set over the Seaton and Scaurnose\r\nwould not have been welcomed by the marquis and his Clemency. The House\r\nwas head and heart of the whole district.\r\n\r\nA conventional visitor was certain to feel very shruggish at first sight\r\nof the terms on which the marquis was with \"persons of that sort;\" but\r\noften such a one came to allow that it was no great matter: the persons\r\ndid not seem to presume unpleasantly, and, notwithstanding his atrocious\r\ntraining, the marquis was after all a very good sort of\r\nfellow--considering.\r\n\r\nIn the third year he launched a strange vessel. Her tonnage was two\r\nhundred, but she was built like a fishing-boat. She had great stowage\r\nforward and below: if there was a large take, boat after boat could\r\nempty its load into her, and go back and draw its nets again. But this\r\nwas not the original design in her. The after half of her deck was\r\nparted off with a light rope-rail, was kept as white as holy-stone could\r\nmake it, and had a brass-railed bulwark. She was steered with a wheel,\r\nfor more room; the top of the binnacle was made sloping, to serve as a\r\nlectern; there were seats all round the bulwarks; and she was called the\r\nClemency.\r\n\r\nFor more than two years he had provided training for the fittest youths\r\nhe could find amongst the fishers, and now he had a pretty good band\r\nplaying on wind-instruments, able to give back to God a shadow of His\r\nown music. The same formed the Clemency's crew. And every Sunday evening\r\nthe great fishing-boat, with the marquis and almost always the\r\nmarchioness on board, and the latter never without a child or children,\r\nled out from the harbor such of the boats as were going to spend the\r\nnight on the water.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the ground all the other boats gathered about the\r\ngreat boat, and the chief men came on board, and Malcolm stood up\r\nbetwixt the wheel and the binnacle, and read--always from the gospel,\r\nand generally words of Jesus, and talked to them, striving earnestly to\r\nget the truth alive into their hearts. Then he would pray aloud to the\r\nliving God, as One so living that they could not see Him, so One with\r\nthem that they could not behold Him. When they rose from their knees man\r\nafter man dropped into his boat, and the fleet scattered wide over the\r\nwaters to search them for their treasure.\r\n\r\nThen the little ones were put to bed, and Malcolm and Clementina would\r\nsit on the deck, reading and talking, till the night fell, when they too\r\nwent below and slept in peace. But if ever a boat wanted help or the\r\nslightest danger arose, the first thing was to call the marquis, and he\r\nwas on deck in a moment.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when a few of the boats had gathered, they would make\r\nfor the harbor again, but now with full blast of praising trumpets and\r\nhorns, the waves seeming to dance to the well-ordered noise divine. Or\r\nif the wind was contrary or no wind blew, the lightest-laden of the\r\nboats would take the Clemency in tow, and with frequent change of rowers\r\ndraw her softly back to the harbor.\r\n\r\nFor such Monday mornings the marquis wrote a little song, and his\r\nClemency made an air to it and harmonized it for the band. Here is the\r\nlast stanza of it:\r\n\r\n     Like the fish that brought the coin,\r\n     We in ministry will join--\r\n     Bring what pleases Thee the best--\r\n     Help from each to all the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR BLACKBIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have in mind the delta of a river whose shores are so level that it is\r\na constant struggle whether land or water shall prevail. The river finds\r\nits way to the broad harbor through a dozen or more channels, between\r\nwhich are low islands overgrown with great trees burdened and festooned\r\nwith grapevines and moss, and tangled with thickets and rank fernbrakes,\r\nor growths of wild rice and luxuriant water-weeds so dense and tall as\r\nto be impenetrable to even a canoe. Here blooms the magnificent lotus\r\n(_Nelumbium luteum_), with its corolla as large as your hat and its leaf\r\nhalf a boat-length broad--great banks of it, which give out a sweet,\r\nfaint, intoxicating odor.\r\n\r\nCurious sounds reach you as you thread the mazes of the swamp. The water\r\nboils up from the oozy bottom, and the bubbles break at the surface with\r\na faint lisping sound: the reeds softly rattle against one another like\r\nthe rustle of heavy silks, and you can hear the lily-pads and\r\ndeeply-anchored stems of the water-weeds rubbing against one another.\r\nMore articulate noises strike your ear--the sharp-clucking lectures on\r\npropriety of the mud-hen to its young; the _brek-kek-kek, coaz-coaz_ of\r\nthe frog; the splash of a tumbling turtle; the rushing of a flock of\r\nstartled ducks rising on swift wings; the sprightly contagious laughter\r\nof those little elves the marsh-wrens, teetering on the elastic leaves\r\nof the cat-tails.\r\n\r\nNo birds are more characteristic of such a reedy tract than the\r\nblackbirds, of which there are several more or less common species in\r\ndifferent parts of the country. The most striking of all, in the eastern\r\nhalf of the Union, is\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD.\r\n\r\nThe red-wing's favorite resort is the vicinity of water where the rushes\r\ngrow densely, among which he places his nest; but the little swales in\r\nthe meadows, where tufts of rank grass flourish upon islands formed by\r\nthe roots of previous years' growth, and a few stunted alders and\r\ncranberry-bushes shade the black water, are nearly always sure to be the\r\nhome of a few pairs. Such extensive marshes as I have just described\r\nare, however, the great centres of blackbird population, where they\r\nbreed, where they collect in great hordes of young and old as the end of\r\nthe season approaches, and whence they repair to the neighboring fields\r\nof Indian corn to tear open the husks and pick the succulent kernels. In\r\nSeptember I have seen them literally in tens of thousands wheeling about\r\nthe inundated wild-rice fields bounding the western end of Lake Erie,\r\ntheir black backs and gay red epaulets glistening in the sun \"like an\r\narmy with banners.\" The Canadian _voyageurs_ call them \"officer-birds,\"\r\nand the impression of an army before him is always strong upon the\r\nbeholder as he gazes at these prodigious flocks in autumn; and it is\r\nextremely interesting to watch the swift evolutions of the crowded\r\nranks, and observe the regularity and concert of action which governs\r\nthe movements of the splendidly uniformed birds.\r\n\r\nThe red-wings are among the earliest of our spring visitors, and south\r\nof the Ohio River and Washington may be found all through the winter.\r\nTheir loud and rollicking spring note is familiar to every one in the\r\ncountry. _Conk-quiree! conk-quiree!_ sings out the male, as though he\r\nknew a good story if only he had a mind to tell it; and then adds\r\n_Chuck!_ as though he thought it of no use to try to interest you in it,\r\nand that he had been indiscreet in betraying an enthusiasm beneath his\r\ndignity over a matter beyond your appreciation. His plain brown mate\r\nimmediately says _Chuck!_ too, quite agreeing with her lord and master\r\nthat it is not best to waste their confidence upon _you_.\r\n\r\nThe centre of all their interest is the compact, tight basket woven of\r\nwet grass-blades and split rush-leaves which is supported among the\r\nreeds or rests on a tussock of wire-grass surrounded by water. It is a\r\nmodel nest, and they understand so well the labor it cost that they are\r\nmightily jealous of harm coming to it. The eggs are five in number, of a\r\nfaded blue tint, marbled, streaked and spotted with leather-color and\r\nblack, in shape rather elongated and pointed. The fledglings are abroad\r\nabout the first of June, when the parents proceed to the production of\r\nanother blood.\r\n\r\nThese blackbirds have the bump of domesticity largely developed, and if\r\ntheir household is disturbed they make a terrible fuss, calling upon all\r\nNature to witness their sorrow and execrate the wretch that is violating\r\ntheir privacy.\r\n\r\nDuring all the spring season, and particularly while the young are being\r\nprovided for, the red-wings subsist almost exclusively on worms, grubs,\r\ncaterpillars and a great variety of such sluggish insects and their\r\nvoracious larvæ as do great damage to the roots and early sprouts of\r\nwhatever the farmer plants, nor do they abandon this diet until the\r\nripening of the wild rice and maize in the fall. \"For these vermin,\"\r\nsays Wilson, \"the starlings search with great diligence in the ground at\r\nthe roots of plants in orchards and meadows, as well as among buds,\r\nleaves and blossoms; and from their known voracity the multitudes of\r\nthese insects which they destroy must be immense. Let me illustrate this\r\nfact by a short computation: If we suppose each bird on an average to\r\ndevour fifty of these larvæ in a day (a very moderate allowance), a\r\nsingle pair in four months, the usual time such food is sought after,\r\nwill devour upward of 12,000. It is believed that not less than a\r\nmillion pair of these birds are distributed over the whole extent of the\r\nUnited States in summer, whose food, being nearly the same, would swell\r\nthe amount of vermin destroyed to 12,000,000,000. But the number of\r\nyoung birds may be fairly estimated at double that of their parents; and\r\nas these are constantly fed on larvæ for three weeks, making only the\r\nsame allowance for them as for the older ones, their share would amount\r\nto 42,000,000,000, making a grand total of 54,000,000,000 of noxious\r\ninsects destroyed in the space of four months by this single species!\r\nThe combined ravages of such a hideous host of vermin would be\r\nsufficient to spread famine and desolation over a wide extent of the\r\nrichest, best-cultivated country on the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe yellow-headed blackbird belongs properly north-west of Lake\r\nSuperior, but frequently gets into Michigan and Illinois. The bright\r\nyellow head and neck make it very noticeable if seen. Its habits are\r\nessentially those of the red-wing.\r\n\r\nWe have another set of blackbirds of greater size, commonly known as\r\n\"crow\" blackbirds, but which in the books are called grakles. There are\r\nseveral species, but none are greatly different from that too-common\r\npest of our cornfields,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PURPLE GRAKLE.\r\n\r\nThe real home of the grakles is along the edges of the swamps--not among\r\nthe reeds where the red-wing and bobolink sit and swing, but rather in\r\nthe bushes and trees skirting the muddy shores. They build their nests\r\nin a variety of positions, but usually a convenient fork in an\r\nalder-bush is chosen, twenty or thirty pairs often nesting within a\r\nradius of a hundred feet. The nest is a rude, strong affair of sticks\r\nand coarse grass-stalks lined with finer grass, and looks very bulky and\r\nrough beside the neat structure of the red-wing; which illustrates how\r\nmuch better a result can be produced by an artistic use of the same\r\nmaterial. In the case of both these birds, however, the female does not\r\nwear the jetty, iridescent coat which adorns the head of the family and\r\nreflects the sunlight in a thousand prismatic tints, but hides herself\r\nand the home she cares for by affecting a dull, brown-black, streaked\r\nsuit, assimilating her closely with the surrounding objects. This\r\nprotective coloration of plumage is possessed by the females of many\r\nspecies of birds, which would be very conspicuous, and of course greatly\r\nliable to danger while incubating their eggs, if they wore the bright\r\ntints of the males. The tanager and indigo-bird afford prominent\r\nexamples. Sometimes the crow blackbirds make their homes at a distance\r\nfrom the water, and occasionally they choose odd places, such as the\r\ntops of tall pine trees, the spires of churches, martin-boxes in gardens\r\nand holes in trees. The latter situation is one which the bronzed\r\nblackbird of the Mississippi Valley (var. _Æneus_) especially makes use\r\nof.\r\n\r\nGrakles' eggs are among the first on every boy's string, and until he\r\ngains experience the young collector supposes he has almost as many\r\ndifferent species represented as he has specimens, so much do they\r\ndiffer, even in the same nestful, in respect to color, shape and size.\r\nTheir length averages about 1.25 by .90 of an inch, but some are long,\r\nslender and pointed, while others are round, fat, and blunt at both\r\nends. The ground color may be any shade of dirty white, light blue,\r\ngreenish or olive brown; the markings consist of sharply-defined spots\r\nand confused blotches, scratches and straggling lines of obscure colors,\r\nfrom blue-black to lilac and rusty brown--sometimes scantily and\r\nprettily marbled upon the surface of the egg, and sometimes painted on\r\nso thick as to wholly conceal the ground color.\r\n\r\nThe crow blackbirds are in the advance-guard of the returning hosts of\r\nspring, making their appearance in small scattering flocks, and\r\nannouncing their presence by loud smacks frequently repeated. They\r\nobtain most of their food from the ground, and walk about with great\r\nliveliness, scratching up the leaves, turning over chips and poking\r\nabout the pastures for insects and seeds softened by the spring rains.\r\nTheir destruction of insects--especially during May, when their young\r\nare in the nest--is enormous; yet their forays upon the cornfields, I\r\nfear, overbalance the good done the farmer by putting an end to grubs\r\nnoxious to his crops.\r\n\r\n\"The depredations committed by these birds are almost wholly on Indian\r\ncorn at different stages. As soon as its blades appear above the ground\r\nafter it has been planted, the grakles descend upon the fields, pull up\r\nthe tender plant and devour the seeds, scattering the green blades\r\naround. It is of little use to attempt to drive them away with a gun:\r\nthey only fly from one part of the field to another. And again, as soon\r\nas the tender corn has formed, these flocks, now replenished by the\r\ngrowing of the year, once more swarm in the cornfields, tear off the\r\nhusks and devour the tender grains. Wilson has seen fields of corn in\r\nwhich more than half the corn was thus ruined.\r\n\r\n\"These birds winter in immense numbers in the lower parts of Virginia,\r\nNorth and South Carolina and Georgia, sometimes forming one congregated\r\nmultitude of several hundred thousand. On one occasion Wilson met, on\r\nthe banks of the Roanoke, on the 20th of January, one of these\r\nprodigious armies of crow blackbirds. They arose, he states, from the\r\nsurrounding fields with a noise like thunder, and descending on the\r\nlength of the road before him, they covered it and the fences completely\r\nwith black: when they again rose, and after a few evolutions descended\r\non the skirts of the high-timbered woods, they produced a most singular\r\nand striking effect. Whole trees, for a considerable extent, from the\r\ntop to the lowest branches, seemed as if hung with mourning. Their notes\r\nand screaming, he adds, seemed all the while like the distant sounds of\r\na great cataract, but in a musical cadence.\"\r\n\r\n                                               ERNEST INGERSOLL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN FRENCH NOVELISTS.\r\n\r\nThe grand old race of French story-tellers has wellnigh departed. One by\r\none the great names in this department of modern French literature\r\nbecome erased from the lists of the living. Nor is this all. Many of the\r\nmost brilliant of the novelists of the day have relinquished the pen of\r\nthe romance-writer for that of the politician. About, for instance,\r\nexpends in the leading articles of the _XIXe. Siècle_ the wit, the\r\nsparkle, the energy that charmed us long years ago in the pages of his\r\nnovels. The younger Dumas--always less a novelist than a dramatist\r\nand (we must coin a word to do justice to the position) an\r\n_im_moralist--confines his efforts now to the production of unclean\r\nplays and uncleaner prefaces, that glow with unwholesome lustre like the\r\nphosphorescent flames that are bred of corruption and quiver over\r\ngraves. Pitiless and cold, with a scalpel in one hand and a\r\nmagnifying-glass in the other, he is at once the closest observer and\r\nthe most eloquent denunciator of the moral maladies of French society.\r\nBut he is not a novelist, strictly speaking. His gifts have another\r\ndirection, his mind another bent. Nor is he altogether a dramatist, as\r\nis Sardou. His comedies are less remarkable on the stage than they are\r\nin the library. An invincible passion for preaching mars the development\r\nof the action. His characters say more than they do, and his plays charm\r\nless by any actual theatrical qualifications than by the extreme finish\r\nand brilliancy of their style. He will bring two men on the stage, and\r\nwill let them talk together for half an hour without moving a muscle.\r\nThey say wonderfully wise and witty things, it is true. But such\r\ndramatic writing is not exactly in the manner of Shakespeare. M. Dumas\r\nevidently dreams that his mission is to regenerate French society, but,\r\napparently, he has as yet found the task beyond his powers. Nor are the\r\nmeans he suggested--in _L'Étrangère_, for instance--exactly those that\r\nwould most strongly commend themselves to the Anglo-Saxon mind.\r\n\r\nAmong the most daring and successful of the novel-writers of the day we\r\nmust undoubtedly number M. Émile Zola, whose recent works have created a\r\ndeep and widespread sensation in literary circles in France. He is the\r\nchief of the so-called Realistic school, and is already recognized as a\r\npower in the land. To describe the characteristics of his works it is\r\nnecessary to speak in superlatives. They are immensely strong, immensely\r\nrealistic, and, it must also be added, immensely repulsive. Vice stands\r\nbefore us stripped of all her plumes and tinsel--naked, hideous and\r\nunclean. In _Thérèse Roquin_, for instance, he tells a tale of\r\nadulterous passion, of murder and of remorse. It is precisely the theme\r\nthat used to arouse the genius of George Sand to its loftiest and most\r\nimpassioned flights. But instead of poets and high-born ladies, moonlit\r\nnights and Italian landscapes, poetry, romance, art and music, Zola\r\ndescends to the lower classes of society: he takes his characters from\r\nthe shop and the factory, and shows us evil in all its abominations,\r\nremorse in all its horrors. In _L'Assommoir_, his latest and, in some\r\nrespects, his most remarkable work, he has given us so atrocious and so\r\npowerful a delineation of the vices of the French working-classes that\r\nthe mind recoils, sickened and terrified, from the contemplation of the\r\ntremendous picture. To find its parallel even in another form of art we\r\nmust turn to some of the most repulsive of the pictures of Hogarth, the\r\nrepresentation of Gin Lane or the dissection-scene in the \"Successive\r\nStages of Cruelty.\" Yet the foremost figures in this terrible\r\ndelineation, his hero and heroine, are not wicked: they are simply weak.\r\nThe _assommoir_--otherwise the drinking-shop--is the spider that poisons\r\nand ensnares their humble natures. The first pages of the book, the\r\nwedding and installation of Gervaise and Coupeau, the birth of their\r\nchild, her anxieties, her cares, her longing for a clock, her pride in\r\nher modest home, are all told with a touch of tenderness, which,\r\nhowever, speedily disappears amid an accumulation of unclean horrors.\r\nThe book is hideous, terrific, disgusting, but it is _not_ immoral. It\r\nis scarcely fit for any decent woman to read, but it is no more\r\ndemoralizing than is the interior of a dissecting-room.\r\n\r\nIn the _History of the Rougon Macquart Family_, a series of six separate\r\nworks united by the slightest of links, M. Zola attempted to trace the\r\ncareer of a family during the period of the Second Empire, or rather he\r\ntried, in imitation of Victor Hugo, to make an epoch, and not a human\r\nbeing, the hero of the work. In this he has but partially succeeded. The\r\n_Rougon Macquart Family_ is less a novel or series of novels than it is\r\na dissertation on the Second Empire from a hostile point of view. As a\r\ngallery of historical pictures, painted by an able and contemporaneous\r\nhand, it is a work of considerable value, but this value is in spite of,\r\nnot on account of, the story. Victor Hugo could indeed embody in his\r\n_Quatre-Vingt Treize_ the mighty image of the first Revolution, but M.\r\nZola is not Victor Hugo, and such a task is beyond his powers.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of this tremendous and iconoclastic realist is\r\nthe care with which he writes and the indefatigable polish he bestows\r\nupon his style. He writes and re-writes, corrects and copies, weighs\r\nevery phrase, and is never content till the written words exactly\r\nreproduce the image of his thought. Another is his extreme reticence and\r\nself-possession. There are no traces of a fine frenzy about the most\r\nvigorous of his works. He paints vice from the standpoint of a\r\nstreet-corner. To others he leaves the roses and the raptures: for him\r\nare the mud and the stones. He has no illusions respecting the lower\r\norders, as had Dickens and Eugène Sue. He reminds one of a certain\r\npicture by Courbet, who, disgusted with the elegant studies of the nude\r\nin the annual exhibition, painted a group of real every-day bathers,\r\nsome half a dozen washerwomen at Asnières. The picture was revolting,\r\nbut it was great, because there was truth in the subject and power in\r\nthe execution. And notwithstanding the tempest of adverse criticism\r\nwhich his later works, and especially his _Assommoir_, have called\r\nforth, he holds a high and recognized place amid the writers of the day.\r\n\r\nTo turn from Zola to Alphonse Daudet is to leave the back slums of a\r\ncity for a flower-decked forest-path: it is to exchange the hideous\r\nfacts of police records and city statistics for the fresh and tender\r\npoesy of the woods and fields. M. Daudet is yet so young that he may\r\npossibly surpass in the future even the great success of his earlier\r\ncareer--namely, _Fromont Jeune et Risler Ainé_. His _Nabob_, now in\r\ncourse of publication as a feuilleton in one of the Parisian newspapers,\r\nis a work of far different style and scope from his first great success.\r\n\r\nAmong the rising writers of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ the name of\r\nAndré Theuriet is rapidly becoming prominent. As chaste, as tender, as\r\nsincere as Daudet, if less gifted and poetical, he depicts provincial\r\nlife and manners with scarcely less skill than does his brilliant\r\ncontemporary the factory and the salons of the Marais. He is, above all,\r\nan adorer of the woods--not such wild virgin forests as may still be\r\nmet with in our own land, but the decorous and well-trained woods of\r\nFrance, where the very trees seem to have learned politeness and keep to\r\ntheir own places, not one of them daring to tower to an undue height or\r\nto spread its roots or branches over an unaccustomed breadth of space.\r\nBorn at Marly-le-Roi, his youth was spent at Bar-le-Duc, and in his\r\nmature manhood he was transferred to Auberive--three points where his\r\nlove of forests could be indulged in to any extent. Something of the\r\nfreshness, the summer sweetness, the natural charm of his favorite\r\nhaunts seems to pervade the atmosphere of his graceful and delicate\r\ntales. He is one of the few French novelists one can imagine writing in\r\nEnglish. _Gerard's Marriage_, _Angèle's Fortune_, _An Undine_, are all\r\nimbued with that peculiar quality which the French call _honnêteté_--an\r\nexpression for which our language furnishes no equivalent. Neither\r\nstriking in incident nor complicated in plot, his stories charm by their\r\ndelicate delineations of character, their refinement of tone and\r\nsincerity of sentiment, and their truthfulness of description. His\r\nstories remind one of what Miss Mulock's novels used to be when she\r\nwrote her best, while Daudet might be characterized as a Parisian\r\nmingling of Hawthorne and Bret Harte, and Zola as a brutal Thackeray.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Claretie has written many novels. But he has also written\r\nplays, histories, biographies, leading articles: he is the most\r\nindefatigable of writers, as he is one of the most intelligent and\r\nclear-headed. He has, however, the defect of being a literary Don Juan,\r\nwasting his smiles amid the _mille e tre_ instead of consecrating his\r\npen in legitimate wedlock to a single Muse. The immense facility with\r\nwhich he writes is fatal to the enduring success of his novels. They\r\nabound in powerful episodes and strong bits of description, and here and\r\nthere some single scene, original in conception and forcible in\r\ntreatment, starts out from the mass like the scarlet draperies in a\r\nfaded piece of Gobelin tapestry. His gifts are those of an historian or\r\nof a critic, not those of a novel-writer. When in his historical\r\nnovels, such as _Les Muscadins_ or _Le Beau Solignac_, he trenches on\r\nthe firm ground of the Real, his true force displays itself. In these\r\nworks he has attempted to revive the lengthy chronicles of the elder\r\nDumas, but without that irrepressible verve, that headlong vehemence of\r\nanimal spirits, which, like the rush of a locomotive, bore the reader,\r\nbreathless and interested, over rough places and smooth alike. The\r\ndraught M. Claretie brews for our drinking bears no affinity to that\r\nintoxicating and sparkling champagne. The Dumas brand is exhausted, and\r\nall imitations are but as flat cider in comparison. In the _Renegade_,\r\nwhich is a specimen of a style of fiction largely in vogue at present in\r\nFrance--one that might be called the contemporaneous historical\r\nnovel--M. Claretie found himself once more on firm and familiar ground.\r\nThe hero of the _Renegade_ is a Republican politician who turns\r\nBonapartist, and who finally commits suicide something after the fashion\r\nof M. Prevost-Paradol, whose career, it is indeed said, suggested the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nBut M. Claretie is seen at his best when he lays down the pen of a\r\nnovel-writer and takes up that of a critic or that of a chronicler of\r\npassing events. His plays possess the same defects as his novels, being\r\ndiffuse, devoid of incident and overloaded with unnecessary details. But\r\nthe clearness and vigor of the style, the strong sense and daylight\r\nintelligence that reign in all his writings, prevent his poorest works\r\nfrom being commonplace or uninteresting.\r\n\r\nArsène Houssaye, like his almost un-namable contemporary Belot, is the\r\nLaureate of Vice. His imagination is as unclean as a street-gutter, only\r\nit is a gutter that runs rose-water. He deals exclusively with the\r\n\"roses-and-raptures\" side of the question. He always lays the scene of\r\nhis romances in dainty boudoirs, beneath the soft light of real wax\r\ncandles (gas would be far too vulgar). He revels in annals of the\r\nnobility. His heroes seldom or never are without a \"handle to their\r\nnames.\" His heroines are usually selected from a set whose name he has\r\nchosen as the title of one of his novels--_Les Courtisanes du Grand\r\nMonde_. His books would be injurious if they were not so very stupid.\r\nThey are improbable in incident, immoral in tone, exaggerated in style\r\nand lamentably dragged out in length. The trail of the class among which\r\nM. Houssaye spends his days is visible in every page. M. Houssaye is\r\npossessed with a passionate desire to become a member of the French\r\nAcademy. Well, why should he not sit where Taine does not and where\r\nSardou does? His _History of the Forty-first Fauteuil_, one of the\r\nbrightest and wittiest of his works, will probably avail, not to open\r\nthe doors to him, but to bar them against him.\r\n\r\n                                                        L. H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANÇOIS BULOZ.\r\n\r\nThe man whose fortunes were to be during nearly half a century connected\r\nwith the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ was born in 1804 at Vulbens, a village\r\nin French Savoy. Without becoming anything of a savant, M. Buloz\r\nreceived the fair education then obtainable at the Collége Louis le\r\nGrand. After leaving school he was forced to take a situation at some\r\nchemical works in Sologne, but soon returned disgusted and without means\r\nto Paris. There we find him passing his days in a printing-office, and\r\nhis evenings--and often, too, his nights--in miscellaneous reading. In\r\nall that he did he displayed that indomitable energy which characterized\r\nhis entire subsequent career.\r\n\r\nThe _Revue des Deux Mondes_ had been started in 1829. It was a sickly\r\nbantling, and had to change its name the following year to the _Journal\r\ndes Voyages_. The new name, however, brought no fresh subscribers, and\r\nthe _Journal_ was dragging on a dreary existence when M. Auffray, the\r\nprinter, bought it, and engaged his former schoolfellow, François Buloz,\r\nas editor of the new series of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. His yearly\r\nsalary was twelve hundred francs, and two francs for every subscriber.\r\nThere were then but three hundred and fifty of these, but in 1834 the\r\nthree hundred and fifty had become one thousand; in 1838 five hundred\r\nmore had been added; in 1843 there were two thousand; in 1846, two\r\nthousand five hundred; and in 1851, five thousand. Long before this the\r\n_Revue_ had become a power. Buloz remained as a partner, but M. Auffray\r\nhad long since given up his interest in it: he had been succeeded by\r\nAlexander Bixio, and the latter by Messrs. Florestan and Felix Bonnaire,\r\nthe owners of the _Revue de Paris_. Messrs. Bonnaire in 1845 proposed to\r\nbuy out Buloz for a sum exceeding one hundred thousand francs. After\r\nconsulting with Mérimée, Sainte-Beuve and others, Buloz declined the\r\nproposal, and with the aid of his friends bought out the brothers\r\nBonnaire for a sum just double that which they had offered him. It was\r\nthen, in 1846, that the new company was constituted, with Buloz as\r\nmanaging director, and M. Molé, M. d'Haussonville, M. de Saint Priest,\r\nCount Roger, the duc de Broglie, M. de Rothschild, M. Baude and others\r\nas stockholders. A number of writers too were interested in the concern,\r\nand were to pay for their stock in the shape of contributions. A year or\r\ntwo before, the _Revue_ had been most violently attacked by persons ill\r\ndisposed to bear with M. Buloz's firm determination to admit nothing\r\ninto the _Revue_ but what he considered up to the standard requisite to\r\nmaintain its reputation. Alexandre Dumas led the coalition, which was in\r\npart made up of men who had been criticised by the _Revue_. As was\r\nnatural, their enmity only advertised the periodical and increased its\r\ncirculation. Still, his enemies managed in more ways than one to make\r\nhim feel their power. Ever since 1838, M. Buloz, under the title of\r\n\"commissaire du roi,\" had been manager of the Théâtre Français, but\r\nafter the revolution of 1848 he was abruptly dismissed. Thenceforth he\r\ngave his attention exclusively to his literary enterprise, and the\r\n_Revue_ gained thereby.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first, Buloz had secured the rising literary talent of the\r\nday for the _Revue_. Alfred de Vigny contributed to it successively\r\n_Stello_, _Laurette_ and _Le Capitaine Renaud_; Alexandre Dumas, whose\r\njealousy was only aroused later on, published therein his _Impressions\r\nde Voyage_; Balzac wrote for it, as did also Nodier, Victor Hugo,\r\nBarbier, Brizeux, Mérimée, Lerminier, George Sand, Jouffry, Alfred de\r\nMusset, Sainte-Beuve, Gustave Planche and Augustin Thierry, whose\r\n_Nouvelles lettres sur l'Histoire de France_ first appeared in the\r\n_Revue_.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, M. Thiers, while president of the council, wrote an article for\r\nthe _Revue_. Buloz, who greatly admired the statesman-historian, pressed\r\nhim strongly the following year to write upon the Eastern Question. M.\r\nThiers, then at Lille, was about to go to Germany in order to examine\r\nthe battle-fields of Napoleon for his great work. We find him writing to\r\nBuloz a letter which is not less interesting at the present time than it\r\nwas thirty-six years ago: \"I often think of writing for you an article\r\non the Eastern Question, but it is somewhat difficult for me to leave my\r\nwork. However, I am preparing to put pen to paper in order to carry out\r\nmy promise. I must tell you that with an ever-increasing taste for _la\r\ngrande politique_, I daily care less and less for _la petite politique_,\r\nwhich consists in simply providing each day for the requirements of the\r\nhour. This daily bread upon which men live at Paris is repugnant to my\r\ntastes. I am a strong partisan of our institutions, for I know of none\r\nother possible, but they convert the government of the country into an\r\nassociation for the merest chit-chat.... It is therefore for me a real\r\nsacrifice to return to the narrow sphere of affairs of the present day,\r\nand to speak or write thereon. I am happy where I am, and in doing what\r\nI am now about.... Still, I will make an effort to write for you before\r\nleaving for Germany. I see nothing very important except the Eastern\r\nQuestion, which is not a _question du moment_, and which will outlive\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nIt is truly wonderful how many men eminent in various departments Buloz\r\nmanaged to enrol among the contributors to the _Revue_. Of course, his\r\nstrict adherence to the rule he had laid down of rigidly exercising his\r\nprerogative as director led many who had written a few articles for the\r\n_Revue_ to abandon it in disgust. Still, many even of these returned\r\nafter years of separation to their old love. Buloz maintained his even\r\ncourse undaunted by storms of criticism. He was to be found early and\r\nlate at work, constantly reading, correcting proofs, busying himself as\r\nto the punctuation, the type, even the appearance of the title-pages. He\r\nhimself was wont to define his position thus: \"I am the public: all I\r\nask is to be instructed or interested. If a work neither instructs nor\r\ninterests me, the chances are that it will produce no better effect on\r\nthe real public for whom it is written.\" He was always fearing that\r\nsomething would intervene to prevent the publication appearing by the\r\n1st or the 15th of each month, and became almost feverishly agitated as\r\nthe calendar pointed to the near approach of the day of publication.\r\n\r\nHe received a severe blow by the death in 1869 of Louis Buloz, an\r\nintelligent, active and devoted young man who had already become the\r\nsharer of his father's toils. He went off to the estate he had purchased\r\nin 1859 in Savoy, commanding a view of the Valley of Chambéry and the\r\nLake of Bourget. While in this charming retreat the news reached him of\r\nthe successive French defeats, culminating in the surrender of Sedan,\r\nthe revolution of the 4th of September and the march of the Germans upon\r\nParis. Without paying heed to his already weakened condition of health,\r\nhe set out at once for Paris. Duty called him there, as he considered,\r\nand every other consideration was hushed. \"What,\" his friends asked,\r\n\"could the _Revue_ do in a besieged city, separated from so large a\r\nproportion of its readers and contributors?\" Buloz was deaf to their\r\nremonstrances, and, struggling bravely against the enormous difficulties\r\nof his position, he managed, with the aid of a few devoted writers like\r\nM. de Mazade and Vitel, to get the _Revue_ out regularly during all\r\nthose painful, weary weeks. When at length Paris capitulated, on the\r\n28th of January, 1871, the world first knew to what straits the _Revue_\r\nhad been reduced. Its means had become completely exhausted. There was\r\nno paper left, nor were there funds to replenish the stock of the\r\nprinting-office, even supposing that such a stock could have been\r\npurchased at that time. Yet, terrible as had been the struggle to keep\r\nup the _Revue_ during the siege, there was yet a harder task in store\r\nfor M. Buloz and his family. After the capitulation he and his\r\nassociates at once set about organizing afresh the entire machinery of\r\nthe _Revue_. This occupied some six weeks, and when all the arrangements\r\nhad been completed one contributor after another left the city. M.\r\nBuloz, too, went away. All at once broke forth, on the 18th of March,\r\nthe Communist insurrection, and Paris for more than two months was in\r\nthe hands of the rabble. It is not too much to say that but for the\r\nintrepidity and intelligent management of affairs by Madame Buloz the\r\npublication of the _Revue_ must have been suspended during part, at\r\nleast, of that period. She feared nothing, but, braving the danger of\r\nfrequent journeys between Paris and Versailles, she summoned to her aid\r\nall the contributors and friends she was able to communicate with. Of\r\ncourse it was not long ere the Communist leaders perceived that true\r\nliberty, such as they understood it, was incompatible with the existence\r\nof such an outspoken periodical as the _Revue_. They arrested M. Émile\r\nBeaussaire for his courageous article entitled \"Le procès entre Paris et\r\nla Province,\" and the other contributors, as well as M. Buloz himself,\r\nwould have certainly shared the same fate could they have been found.\r\n\r\nAfter the number of the 15th of May had appeared the rulers of the city\r\nvoted that the continuance of the _Revue_ was prejudicial to the\r\ninterests of the Commune, and accordingly its suppression was decreed.\r\nOn the 25th of May, however, Paris was again occupied by the government\r\ntroops, and thus the number of the 1st of June was published as\r\npunctually as all its predecessors.\r\n\r\n                                                        C. H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER-LILIES.\r\n\r\nWho does not love the beautiful water-lily, the _Nympha odorata_ of our\r\nponds and lakes? No one, not even he of whom the poet said,\r\n\r\n     A primrose by the river's brim\r\n     A yellow primrose was to him,\r\n     And it was nothing more,\r\n\r\ncould be quite insensible to the charms of this loveliest of wild\r\nflowers. Yet those who have seen it only in those crowded, half-wilted\r\nbunches in the vegetable markets or in the hands of enterprising urchins\r\non railroad trains know little of its perfect state. To come upon it\r\nunexpectedly, holding its snowy petals proudly open upon the still water\r\nof some sylvan lake, is a poetic inspiration. There it breathes its\r\ndivinest fragrance. There, enthroned with its companions among its\r\nshining green leaves spread out upon the water, it is an enchanting\r\nvision. Plucked from its anchorage at the bottom of the lake, it soon\r\ncloses its corolla, as if hiding its beauty and its sorrow from the eyes\r\nof the captor.\r\n\r\nOur pond-lily closely resembles the lotus, the _Nympha lotus_ of Egypt,\r\nSyria and other countries of the East, which has been venerated in all\r\ntimes, and figures extensively in Egyptian hieroglyphics, besides\r\nforming the model for the capital of Egyptian columns. Another, or\r\nperhaps the same species, is held sacred among the Hindoos. It is\r\nintimately connected with their religion, and they give it a wonderful\r\norigin. Vishnu, the God of Light, the Preserver, is represented seated\r\nupon the lotus and holding one of the flowers in his hand.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of the water-lily in the East--the one mentioned\r\nand the _Nympha coerulea_. The latter, as the name implies, is blue,\r\nand said to be wonderfully beautiful. A blue water-lily! What an object\r\nto thrill the soul of the florist! It must be rare even in gardens of\r\nacclimatization. Who has ever seen one? Perhaps it would flourish in\r\nsome of our small lakes farther South. It would produce a splendid\r\neffect growing with the white water-lily in our ponds.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year or two there have been paragraphs in our newspapers\r\ndeclaring that the pond-lily could be made to grow in gardens. Most\r\npeople have doubted it. Could a flower so naturally wild, so secluded\r\nin its loveliness, so fond of shady nooks and comparatively deep water,\r\nbe made to expand its shy petals and exhale its rare perfume in a vulgar\r\ntub? Yet is it true. Like the noblest beauty of every kind, it blesses\r\ndespite captivity and ignoble surroundings.\r\n\r\nLast spring I determined to give the cultivation of the water-lily a\r\ntrial, and impressed an old lime hogshead into the service. This I had\r\nsawed through the middle, and one half sunk in the ground at the\r\nnorth-east end of the veranda, under the rain-spout. Then, armed with a\r\nbig basket and a long rake, two of us started for the pond, about a mile\r\ndistant, where the lilies grew. Some of the leaves, as yet all rolled\r\ntogether, were just peeping from the water.\r\n\r\nThe process of dragging out the roots was rather difficult, but\r\nexhilarating. First, we threw out the long rake, let it sink, worked it\r\ndown into the mud as far as practicable, and then pulled together with\r\nall our strength. At every pull we brought up a long piece of the fleshy\r\nroot with several leaves just sprouting; but every pull, or rather every\r\nyielding of a root, resulted in our sudden sitting down on the marshy\r\nground with peals of laughter. This was the exhilarating part. We placed\r\nthe roots, with all the doughy clay adhering, in the basket, and tugged\r\nit home with many pauses for rest and frequent changing of hands. The\r\nbasket seemed freighted with lead, and the dripping of yellow mud was\r\nnot improving to the appearance of shoes and stockings.\r\n\r\nSeeing the kind of bed the lily flourished in in the pond, we did not\r\ndare trust the roots to common mould, and therefore packed the bottom of\r\nthe tub a foot deep with the common swamp-muck used on the farm. In this\r\nwe planted the roots, put in several pails of cistern-water, and left\r\nthe rain, already falling, to do the rest. The next morning the tub was\r\nfull of the dirtiest-looking liquid imaginable. It did not become\r\nperfectly clear for several weeks; and then our labor was rewarded by\r\nthe sight of numerous little folded leaves, which soon reached the top\r\nand unfolded their satiny, green surface upon the water. The smallness\r\nof the leaves troubled me greatly at first, not knowing that they grow\r\nbroad after opening. After patient waiting, and after covering the tub\r\nwith mosquito-netting to disabuse the young turkeys of the notion that\r\nit was specially designed as a drinking-cup and a watery grave for them,\r\nand the young ducks of the notion that it was preordained for them to\r\nswim in, we were delighted to see a veritable lily-bud coming up.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment (July 25th) the whole surface of the water is\r\ncovered with leaves so large and fresh and beautiful that these alone\r\nwould compensate for all the trouble taken. The leaves are quite as\r\nlarge, many of them, as the largest seen in the wild state, and among\r\nthem are two superbly perfect lilies, and several more struggling up to\r\nthe light. For the winter I shall cover the tub with boards and a thick\r\nlayer of straw, which will keep the water from freezing much below the\r\nsurface, and, I trust, preserve the precious roots at the bottom.\r\n\r\nA little visitor from Philadelphia, whose grand passion is collecting\r\nturtles, lizards, frogs, etc., has added five small frogs to the tub. At\r\nany time one or more of them may be seen enthroned on a large leaf,\r\nwhile at night callers sitting on the veranda hear the gentle croaking\r\nand are greatly puzzled to account for it.\r\n\r\n                                                           M. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEGLECTED BRANCH OF PHILOLOGY.\r\n\r\nSlang must be coeval with the race. That part of the race which delights\r\nin and creates it must have always existed. It is found in the oldest\r\nlight literature we possess, and in some of the gravest. It abounds in\r\nthe Greek plays, not being limited to those of them which avowedly\r\n\"Aristophanize.\" We can imagine the gamins of Israel echoing and\r\nembellishing the \"chaff\" launched by Elijah at the discomfited priests\r\nof Baal. Miriam comes as close to it as a lady may in her exultations\r\nover the drenched Egyptians. Terence is full of it, and the _graffiti_\r\nexhumed in Italy further enlighten us as to the deadest portion of one\r\nof the dead languages.\r\n\r\nSlang is one form of popular poetry. It will maintain its existence, in\r\never-fleeting shapes, so long as the mind of the masses has a poetic\r\nside, and will particularly flourish wherever circumstances favor the\r\ncombination, in the ideas of the masses, of the grotesque and the novel\r\nwith the imaginative. In this country, the West--and California, the\r\nfarthest border of the West--is the hotbed of slang. A Western writer\r\n\"spreads himself\" at the expense of a rival who \"welters\" in \"gush\" or\r\n\"slops over\" too profusely. His darling aim is to get his own \"head\r\nlevel\" and to send his opponent off \"on his ear.\" Of some of the phrases\r\nof this kind the origin is difficult to trace, and generally not worth\r\ntracing. Others are markedly metaphorical fittings of words with new\r\nmeanings, and often highly expressive meanings. They are efforts of\r\nfancy not conveyed in metre, nor even in prose, but condensed into a\r\nsingle word or phrase. They thus become portable enough to run like\r\nlightning from tongue to tongue and pen to pen over a continent. But,\r\nlike other electric flashes, they are not usually of long duration. If\r\nquickly started, they are as quickly forgotten. Each generation or\r\ndecade or year manufactures its own supply of slang words, and seldom\r\nbequeaths any of them as a permanent inheritance. Delineators of rude or\r\nlow life, like the littérateurs of the Pacific coast school, Dickens and\r\nThackeray, embed in their writings the slang of their day; but it stays\r\nthere, recommended though it may be by the brilliancy of its setting,\r\nand rarely passes into currency outside of their pages. Its flavor is\r\nusually too local and fugitive for that.\r\n\r\nAs slang blends in one direction with genuine poetry, in another it\r\nsinks into the base jargon invented by evil-doers for the disguise of\r\ntheir intercourse and concealment of their purposes. Of the latter\r\ndescription are the dialects of the prize-ring and the fraternity of\r\nthieves. These are rich and copious, and often ingenious, like the other\r\ndevices of their originators. How far the gypsy language may be\r\nincluded with them it is impossible to say; but it has been largely\r\nborrowed from by them, thanks either to community of objects, and\r\nconsequent sympathy of feelings, or to its obscurity and shapelessness,\r\nand the utter ignorance of it among the intelligent and plunderable\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThese classes have a slang of their own too; and some of it gets\r\nestablished in the language. Broadly speaking, all foreign words which\r\nare adopted from affectation, and not from the growing necessities of\r\nscience and thought, may be ranked as slang. That they should\r\noccasionally effect a lodgment it is not at all indispensable that they\r\nshould impart a new idea. Very often they merely elbow out an old member\r\nof the vernacular conveying precisely the same meaning. It would be easy\r\nto cite such cases, and to point to naturalized foreigners, now\r\nunnoticed in every-day intercourse, but at their first appearance\r\nconspicuous enough in fashionable slang. Scores of them have been\r\nintroduced to us by the milliner and the tailor. Vouched for by such\r\naugust authority, they are of course elegant. But they are nothing more.\r\nMore solid merit than theirs, in the eyes of the student of language,\r\nbelongs to the humbler products of the popular fancy--words more\r\npointed, more pithy and more graphic, but more fleeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER DEFUNCT MONOPOLY.\r\n\r\nThe patent on sewing-machines has passed into limbo with the patent on\r\nthe revolver and the steam-engine and the patent on gunpowder, if Friar\r\nBacon ever entered his caveat, paid his fee, fought the pirates through\r\nthe courts and took one out--a point on which history, which chronicles\r\nthe minutest military or judicial homicide and the most contemptible\r\ncourt-intrigue of his day, forgets to inform us. His last possible\r\nrenewal, however, would have in any case died out long ago, and left his\r\nvaluable contribution to human happiness as common property as the\r\ncontrivance of the blind, bedevilled, rich and unhappy originator of the\r\nsewing-machine.\r\n\r\nThis great change extinguishes a tribe of agents as numerous and\r\ntroublesome as any that roams the Upper Missouri or the Lower Colorado.\r\nAs numerous, did we say? It outnumbered all the septs of the Sioux--did\r\nmore travelling and peopled more lodges. It had its peculiar literature\r\nand its peculiar vehicles. We have known a single contract made with a\r\nWestern carriage-factory for five hundred sewing-machine wagons, for the\r\nuse of one out of the fifteen or twenty companies. All these gay and\r\njaunty equipages go into quod, like the tumbrils and ambulances left\r\nover in 1865, and with them, into yet more helpless disuse, a mass of\r\nliterature, written, printed and oral, great beyond computation. It is a\r\nfossil industry whereof even the bones have suddenly perished. To its\r\ncredit, be it said, it died game, struggling to the last, its\r\nbattlefield the lobbies of Congress and the halls of the Patent Office.\r\nGold and greenbacks were shed like water, but not much blood save the\r\nblood of the grape. All was in vain. The little needle, with an eye near\r\nthe point, the sharp steel weapon of Howe that so long held at bay all\r\nassailants, puzzled a succession of judges of first and second instance,\r\noriginal and appellate, and enriched a generation of attorneys, was\r\nforced finally to succumb. All the world and his wife--his wife\r\nespecially--may make and use a needle with any style or position of hole\r\nwithout paying a cent of royalty for the inestimable privilege. That\r\nhistoric implement has the largest liberty, and may disport itself in an\r\ninfinity of scrolls and intricacies over the raiment of male and female.\r\nThe befrogged officer is no longer limited in the arabesques of braid\r\nand tinsel that make gay his manly breast. He commands all the resources\r\nof Snip's imagination, and whirligigs beyond what hath entered the mind\r\nof man to conceive will shortly meander over the cerulean expanse.\r\n\r\n\r\nKATERFELTO IN REPOSE.\r\n\r\nIs there not a lull in the quack-medicine business? Its advertisements\r\ndo not appear to us to shine with the brilliancy of old. Those\r\nastonishing portraits of Old Doctor So-and-So, and the gorgeous\r\nperspective view of the interior of Professor Snooks's laboratory, all\r\nalive with forty 'prentice-power pill-machines and tincture-vats like\r\nthe pools of a swimming academy, have ceased to illustrate the condition\r\nof modern art and medicine.\r\n\r\nPossibly, the sensational style has been found to have lost its force,\r\nand a more quiet and stately tone to be more promotive of the popularity\r\nof bread-pills and root-bitters. It looks more professional.\r\nMountebankery in physic has been overdone, as it has in a great many\r\nother things. The quacks, if they successfully inculcate this lesson and\r\nbring in a corresponding reform, will have been useful public servants.\r\nOthers have been forcing the pace as well as they, and may well slacken\r\nspeed, if not call a halt. The blatant and dogmatic has been\r\nincreasingly predominant in the announcement of new theories, notions\r\nand \"missions.\" We are all concerned in seeing it checked, and simple\r\ntruth and plodding inquiry once more given a chance. Repeated\r\ndisappointments have made the world distrustful of startling discoveries\r\nand sweeping panaceas--a fact which should commend itself to the\r\nattention of all the charlatans, and of those who, not charlatans, have\r\ncaught from them the fashion of violent and premature trumpeting.\r\nPolitical and social cure-alls will have to work their way slowly and\r\npainfully into notice. They must submit to the rules of trade, and not\r\nlook for success until they have demonstrated that what they offer in\r\nthe market is what it pretends to be. The world is tired of being taken\r\nby storm. Just now it is in a more than usually distrustful mood--in a\r\nstate of marked disillusionment. It declines to have a creed of any kind\r\nslammed into its face--so many new ones have palpably failed, and so\r\nmany old ones have proved themselves possessed of forgotten virtues.\r\nGood and evil have proved to be omnipresent, and to pervade everything,\r\nlike iron and sulphur.\r\n\r\n                                                        E. C. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Madame Gervaisais. By Edmond and Jules de Goncourt. New\r\n     Edition. Paris.\r\n\r\nThis is in many respects a remarkable book. It shows unusual talent and\r\nthought--skill in the morbid anatomy of the soul. It is out of the\r\ncommon line in having but one character, the heroine, and not a word\r\nabout love. It is, in fact, the biography of a woman during her\r\nconversion to Roman Catholicism: the incidents are merely the successive\r\nsteps by which she is brought within the pale. The interest lies in the\r\nmental and moral fluctuations through which she passes while under the\r\ninfluence to which she is subjected, and which in one way or another\r\ndoes not cease to act upon her for an instant. The book is a complement\r\nto Madame Craven's pictures of conversion and the devout life, but\r\ndiffers from them in the point of view.\r\n\r\nMadame Gervaisais is the widow of a man who filled for years an\r\nimportant office under the government by dint of small gifts of\r\nprecision and punctuality, being in himself an insignificant person. His\r\nposition and wealth, and the beauty and superior endowments of his wife,\r\nattracted men of mark to the house, and her _salon_ was long one of the\r\nmost sought in Paris. Her marriage had not been a happy one: the\r\nintellectual resources in which she has sought compensation have been\r\ninsufficient, although she has never tried more exciting distractions,\r\nand at thirty-seven she finds herself free, rich, still handsome, with\r\none child, delicate and slow of development, born after ten years of\r\nwedlock, the spring of her heart and hopes broken from the long pressure\r\nof conjugal despotism and unkindness, her health enfeebled to a degree\r\nwhich makes it advisable for her to spend a winter in Rome. This is the\r\n_status quo_ at the opening of the history. Her life in Rome is told\r\nalmost day by day, affording opportunity for the most detailed\r\ndescriptions of places and customs, times and seasons, festivals and\r\nceremonies: these are given with extreme, scrupulous fidelity and an\r\naccurate choice of words, but they have not the magic touch which brings\r\nunvisited scenes before you or revives half-forgotten ones with the\r\nfreshness of things seen yesterday. This is strange, as the impressions,\r\nthe sensations of mind and body, produced upon a stranger by Rome are\r\nwonderfully conveyed. \"She was astonished at the refinement and\r\nacuteness of perception which she had acquired since coming thither....\r\nShe remembered a glass of water which she had drunk at the door of a\r\nlittle café on one of the first evenings, and which had seemed the most\r\ndelicious draught she had ever tasted. It struck her that warm countries\r\nmust possess all sorts of little felicities of soil and climate unknown\r\nin colder ones, an enchanted _aqua felice_ trickling everywhere. And day\r\nby day she felt the nothings of her life assuming an intensity of\r\npleasure and enjoyment that nothings have when one is in love.\" \"In the\r\ngardens of the Villa Borghese on those spring days she had hours of\r\nsingular well-being--a sort of sweet oppression, a relaxation which made\r\nher happy: they were days whose temperature was like a tepid bath, with\r\nwarm whiffs of acacia and orange blossoms; a dusty sky; a sun which was\r\nonly an orange glow; a smothering of the sound of the distant bells; a\r\nsong of disconnected notes, as if the birds were tired; an atmosphere\r\nwhere a line which might be taken for the flight of an insect proved to\r\nbe a drop of rain, which fell every five minutes without wetting you.\"\r\nHer life, which is very solitary, consists principally of sightseeing,\r\nstudy, the care and companionship of her child, and the revery which\r\nhangs about existence in Italy like an exhalation from the ground.\r\nMadame Gervaisais, brought up of course a French Catholic, has gradually\r\nbecome a free-thinker of the serious kind, high-principled and earnest:\r\nshe is described as a woman of elevated mind and character, the force of\r\nwhose will and intelligence has kept her from being betrayed by a\r\nnaturally loving disposition, which has expended itself in friendship\r\nand filial and maternal affection, the latter being her only passion.\r\nThe respectful distance which the author places between her and the rest\r\nof the world is indicated by her first name never being mentioned: she\r\nis only Madame Gervaisais. But she is not only a woman of reading: she\r\nis an artist and a musician, and these tastes increase her\r\nsusceptibility to the soft masterdom of the place.\r\n\r\nRome is considered by those who make such matters their business a\r\npeculiarly favorable spot for proselytizing: there is supposed to be an\r\nafflatus from various sources which disposes the unbelieving soul to the\r\nreception of the Church's teaching. The MM. de Goncourt understand this:\r\n\"What a vast embrace, what an immense holy contagion, is religion at\r\nRome!\" We become aware of a general lassitude and ennervation in the\r\nfirm texture of Madame Gervaisais's nature before the first approach is\r\nmade to her convictions. And how are those approaches made? Can any one\r\npoint to the first step? Has it ever been positively ascertained whether\r\na certain meeting, a borrowed book, a striking coincidence, a\r\nconversation which has insensibly glided into a particular channel, was\r\nthe result of chance or long premeditation? In the present case it is\r\nimpossible to detect the earliest shadow of design falling across\r\ncircumstance. Was Madame Gervaisais's landlady sent to offer prayers for\r\nthe recovery of the sick child at the Sant' Agostino? Did the\r\nman-servant read her journal and report its contents? Had the Russian\r\ncountess come on purpose to make her acquaintance when she found her\r\nsitting under the oak tree at Castel Gandolfo reading Lammenais's essay\r\non religious indifference? The mystery which surrounds these questions\r\ncorresponds entirely to similar unexplained occurrences in Madame\r\nCraven's seductive pages, where the finger of the sacred-supernatural is\r\ntacitly supposed to play a decisive part. But, chance or calculation, it\r\nleads in the same direction; and after a year and a half in Rome, Madame\r\nGervaisais, who has given up Lammenais for a book of her Russian\r\nfriend's, and has fallen into a state of languid dejection, takes to\r\nattending the regular sermon at the Jesuits' church, where the music,\r\nthe paintings, the architecture, corrupt in style as they are, gradually\r\ninduce a sort of somnolent ecstasy. Before many Sundays pass a\r\ncelebrated preacher ascends the pulpit. \"He was known as a man of talent\r\nin the order--an actor, a pantomimist, a comedian, a tragedian, whose\r\ngesticulatory and perambulatery eloquence swept the platform, and whose\r\ndramatic fire was enough to kindle the wood of the desk. He declaimed,\r\nwept, sobbed, raised his voice, let it break, whimpered, thundered, and\r\nhis discourse gave the congregation all the emotions and illusions of a\r\ntheatrical recitation.\" Madame Gervaisais at first hardly listens, but a\r\nfew words suddenly arrest her attention, and she hears the preacher\r\nsay, \"Rash and audacious woman--and not only rash and audacious, but\r\nwretched and unhappy--who dares to disdain the manifestations of the\r\ndivine will, and declares that her own reason is the only light she\r\nneeds!\" proceeding to describe her habitual attitude of mind, and\r\nwinding up with a terrible denunciation delivered with the authority\r\nwhich those alone can wield who believe themselves the mouthpieces of\r\nInfallibility. She returns home profoundly shaken, with the dreadful\r\nsuspicion that her inmost secrets have somehow been discovered, and that\r\nshe has been preached at. A few days later she accidentally hears that\r\nit is the princess de Belgiojoso who has been the object of the\r\nfulmination: the relief is unspeakable, and produces a momentary\r\nreaction, but the mark has been made.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to follow in detail an operation which is like the\r\nperpetual falling of drops of water or friction of grains of sand,\r\naccompanied, moreover, by an occult, spiritual process like the function\r\nof an organ. Before many months the proselyte put herself under the\r\ndirection of a Jesuit confessor. Little by little she had separated\r\nherself from her few relations with the outer world; she went no more to\r\nthe French embassy or the French academy, where she had met fresh\r\ncurrents of thought from political, artistic and literary circles; she\r\ngave up a pleasant Italian house where there was superstition enough,\r\nbut not bigotry, broke off her intercourse with a lifelong friend, a\r\nsincere but liberal member of the Gallican Church, and left the letters\r\nof her only brother unanswered and unread. Her faculties were absorbed\r\nby her fanaticism. \"A secret metamorphosis was taking place within her:\r\nher pride of intellect, her spirit of analysis, research, criticism, her\r\nindividuality of judgment, the energy of her own opinions, gave way\r\nlittle by little under a revolution of her moral temperament, a sort of\r\ninversion of her nature.\" She undergoes various phases of beatitude and\r\ndepression, and is amazed at the penetration with which her Jesuit\r\nconfessor, whose study has been human nature and whose learning is\r\nsoul-craft, divines her condition of mind. She lends herself to his\r\npractices in the same way that assistant mortals unconsciously help the\r\nspirits in table-turning. He finds her too self-tormenting and\r\nscrupulous, and after a long and perfectly graduated exordium, in which\r\nhe has felt her spiritual pulse from time to time to ascertain that it\r\ngave the due number of beats, and no more, concludes by telling her to\r\nthrow off all individual responsibility: he assumes that for her.\r\n\"Believe that when you appear before the tribunal of the Sovereign Judge\r\nyou can say, Lord, what I have done or omitted has been in obedience to\r\nthose whom you have given to govern me in your name. And be sure that a\r\nsoul cannot sin in acting according to the orders and lights of its\r\nspiritual father.\" But by the time she had entirely abnegated her\r\naccountability she finds the easy rule of the Jesuits too lax, and for\r\nher further humiliation and penance takes for her director a monk of one\r\nof the barefooted orders--a coarse and ignorant Calabrian peasant, whose\r\nausterity has given him a widespread reputation for sanctity.\r\n\r\nThere is something more than painful in the minute portrayal of the\r\ndegradation of mind, character, even temper, which occupies the latter\r\npart of the book: it is repulsive, and it strikes us as overdone,\r\nalthough we know of at least one similar instance in real life. But\r\nMadame Gervaisais has been represented as an uncommon woman in every\r\nway, and we are forced to allow the progress of undermining disease some\r\nshare in her abasement. The last ten or a dozen chapters and the\r\ntragical conclusion are among the weaker portions of the book, which as\r\na novel has many defects. It is nevertheless an able performance, and\r\nmight be a useful one if people, as a rule, were not more eager for the\r\npoison than the antidote. All the phenomena and experiences which are\r\nunfolded like holy relics by Madame Craven's high-bred hands are\r\nrecognized by MM. de Goncourt, but they are differently accounted for.\r\n\r\nIn _Rénée Mauperin_, another book by the same authors, which with\r\nconsiderable cleverness has also many faults of construction and\r\ndevelopment, we have a glimpse of the cheerful social aspect of the\r\nRoman hierarchy through its intervention in mundane affairs. \"The Abbé\r\nBlampoix had neither parish nor curacy. He had a special vocation: he\r\nwas the priest of the world, the gay world, the great world.... His\r\nvoice was musical and his style flowery. He called the devil 'the prince\r\nof evil,' and the Eucharist 'the divine aliment.' He abounded in\r\nperiphrases colored like sacred prints.... From time to time fashionable\r\nphrases and colloquialisms of the day mingled in his spiritual\r\nconsolations, like bits of a newspaper in a book of devotion. He had\r\nthe odor of the century. His gown kept, as it were, the perfume of all\r\nthe pretty sins which had come near it.... Mothers consulted him before\r\nthey took their daughters to their first ball: daughters sought his\r\nadvice before going thither. He was the man from whom permission was\r\nobtained to wear low-neck dresses--of whom one inquired the novels which\r\nmight be perused and the plays which might be seen. He baptized children\r\nand confessed adulteries of heart.... Great sorrows, despair, had\r\nrecourse to him, and he ordered a journey to Italy, the diversions of\r\npainting and music and a good confession at Rome.\" By this and analogous\r\ncounsel on still more delicate matters he superseded the fashionable\r\nphysician. But what kept him most busy was a species of matrimonial\r\nagency which he managed for the benefit of his flock. \"There was an\r\ninstant's silence, during which nothing was heard but the rustling of\r\nthe abbé's papers. At last he drew out a visiting-card turned down at\r\nthe corner, which he held toward the light, and read: 'Three hundred\r\nthousand francs interest, obligations; fifteen thousand francs income\r\nfrom the wedding-day; father and mother dead; six hundred thousand at\r\nthe death of some uncles and aunts who are not married and will not\r\nmarry. The young lady is nineteen--charming, prettier than she is aware\r\nof. Here, let us think about that,' said the abbé, putting back the\r\ncard. 'Well--let's see: I have also--yes, at this very moment--an\r\norphan: twenty-five thousand francs income on marrying. But no, that\r\nwon't do: the guardian is desirous of an influential connection. Ah!\r\nwait: perhaps this will do: twenty-two years old, not pretty,\r\naccomplished, intelligent, dresses well; the father has fifteen hundred\r\nthousand francs, three children, a solid fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThe authors of these books may not be very good Catholics, but, at all\r\nevents, they are not Protestants, and it cannot be objected that they\r\nare writing of things they know nothing about.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Charlotte Brontë: A Monograph. By T. Wemyss Reid. New York:\r\n     Scribner, Armstrong & Co.\r\n\r\nWe should all be grateful to one who lets in a glint of sunshine on a\r\nscene, a career, a life or a group of lives which we have been\r\naccustomed to see wrapped in unbroken shade. Perfect shadow we distrust\r\ninstinctively, for we know that it is false Art and false Nature. There\r\nmust be a bit of light somewhere for every picture and every being. We\r\nhave long been looking for it, in the face of persistent denial, in the\r\ncase of that famous Haworth household and its literary productions. Mrs.\r\nGaskell rather deepened the gloom of Jane Eyre and Villette, and left us\r\nsmall hope of a glance at the bright side of the characters and the\r\ndaily life of the three weird sisters, their brother Patrick and their\r\nfather, Patrick senior.\r\n\r\nMr. Reid cries _fiat lux_, and carries the proclamation into effect,\r\nlike the impatient gentleman who broke the windows which were obscured\r\nby the too frequent repetition of that motto burnt in on every pane. And\r\nhe suggests, or leaves to dawn upon our after-perception, more light\r\nthan he directly makes. To carry out the glass simile, panes merely\r\ncracked by him drop out piecemeal after he has withdrawn his hand, and\r\nwe come to see more and farther than our guide himself.\r\n\r\nIn this way he unwittingly enlightens us in the trivial matter of the\r\nfamily name. Everybody has wondered how an English country parson came\r\nto have for patronymic Lord Nelson's second title, won in battle from\r\nthe Mediterranean. This Mr. Reid explains by a short cut like the\r\nwell-known solution of an extraordinary story: \"The man lied.\" Brontë,\r\nwith or without an unaccountable diæresis on the last letter, was an\r\nassumed name, adopted by the first and last who bore it purely for the\r\nsake of euphony. Now, while we could believe anything sombre and stern\r\nof one sporting that deep, nasal and majestic appellative, we find it\r\nimpossible to associate thoughts of unearthly gloom with the airy\r\nMilesian cognomen of Pat Prunty, even though weighted with the solemn\r\nprefix of \"Reverend.\" Sure enough, we satisfy ourselves very speedily\r\nthat the parent we have been accustomed to denounce as having blighted\r\nthree or four young lives, and cheated English literature out of several\r\ngood novels, was by no means the savage depicted by Mrs. Gaskell, or\r\neven by Mr. Reid. His worst recorded exploits have something of the\r\nbizarre about them, as when he cut into bits a dress presented to his\r\nwife by one to whom he was not willing she should be indebted, and fired\r\noff pocket-pistols at unseasonable hours and places. Mrs. Prunty does\r\nnot appear to have run short in her wardrobe, nor did the pistols ever\r\nhit any one. The old gentleman, in spite of narrow circumstances, gave\r\nhis daughters and son a good education and what social advantages lay\r\nwithin his reach. The world was clearly more open to them than it was to\r\nhim. A widower from the infancy of all his children, he not unnaturally\r\nbecame a little peculiar and exacting. When, his only son having drunk\r\nhimself to death, the last of three daughters who had reached elderly\r\nand acidulated maidenhood indicated a wish to marry a man she confesses\r\nshe did not love, he objected. Yet he persisted in his opposition only a\r\nfew months. As soon as he perceived Charlotte to be really anxious for\r\nthe union, he gave his full and kindly consent. All his daughters used\r\nhim and his scapegrace of a son freely as literary material, drawing\r\nfrom them the central figures of the most effective of the novels. Nor\r\nwas he an unconscious or unwilling sitter. The writing of the tales soon\r\nceased to be a secret to him. He criticised, suggested and otherwise\r\nassisted with some of them in a more active sense of the term than that\r\nin which it is applied to a spectator.\r\n\r\nA secluded life and narrow range of observation mainly account for what\r\nof morbidness and lack of geniality marks these works. Charlotte's\r\nprivate correspondence, when printed precisely as written and not\r\nclipped or garbled, shows distinctly a sunny side, and justifies the\r\nconclusion that the early life of the sisters was \"unquestionably\r\npeaceful, happy and wholesome.\" That this should be the fact adds to our\r\nenjoyment of the novels. Our confidence in, and consequent admiration\r\nof, a powerful picture are the more assured by our knowledge that the\r\ntouch under which it grew was not cramped or warped by suffering. Had\r\nCharlotte Brontë's literary life been prolonged under the new conditions\r\nopened to her by her sudden fame, we have small reason to suppose that\r\nshe would have created a more telling character than Rochester, though\r\nshe would not have exhausted her powers in the microscopic delineation\r\nof commonplace people which constitutes the province of her most popular\r\nfemale successor. She would have portrayed stronger subjects in a more\r\nvigorous and incisive style. Some critical remarks in her few letters\r\nfrom London are strikingly direct and acute. Thackeray, Mrs. Browning,\r\nTurner and Macready come in for a few lines each which hit them to the\r\nlife. She possessed the critical temperament and faculty. The\r\nmetropolitan field suited to its best exercise she was, alas! destined\r\nnever to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Kismet. (No-Name Series.) Boston: Roberts Brothers.\r\n\r\nAs long as there are readers who care for a novel packed from cover to\r\ncover with interesting scenes of a promising flirtation that ripens into\r\nenthusiastic love-making by which three persons are in turn made\r\nmiserable, so long such books as _Kismet_ will be liked. The scene of\r\nthe story is the Nile, the characters are for the most part voyagers on\r\nthat river, and descriptions of the wonders that line its shores make an\r\nimposing background to the lightness of the incidents. This setting of\r\nthe story makes the book really impressive: the scenery is brought\r\nbefore the reader not in the way a topographical map is constructed, but\r\nby dexterous touches which show that the anonymous author can rise above\r\nrecording the vicissitudes of a more or less conventional courtship. But\r\na good many writers have ship-wrecked just at that which seems so easy\r\nand is really so hard. All the good scenery in the world will not make a\r\ndull novel entertaining; but when, as is the case here, the story is\r\ninteresting, the reader can only be grateful for everything thrown in\r\nover measure. This story is clever, because it describes so well the way\r\nin which a young woman who at the beginning of the tale is engaged to a\r\nyoung painter, George Ferris, whom she does not really love, learns a\r\ngood deal about that passion when she meets the more fascinating Arthur\r\nLivingston on the Nile, and travels for a long time in his company. This\r\nLivingston, too, is not the conventional hero whose success wins the\r\nenvious hatred of every man that reads its history: on the contrary, he\r\nis a well-drawn, probable character, who is well informed without being\r\npriggish, and whose sentimentality does not too thickly overlie his more\r\nactive qualities. He seems like what he is--a rich young American who\r\nprefers Europe to this country, and who is not spoiled by living abroad.\r\nThe whole relation in which he stands to the heroine, Bell Hamlyn--or\r\nMiss Hamlyn, as she is generally called, while her step-mother is almost\r\nalways known as Flossy--is entertainingly and naturally told. To be\r\nsure, the veteran reader of novels will have a sense of having come\r\nacross some of the incidents several times before, but what will seem\r\nmuch less familiar are the humor and the amusing satire with which the\r\nfoibles of travellers are made fun of. The collarless American, the\r\nartless young Englishman, the light-minded flirt of the same country,\r\nand the more solemn British tourist, are shown up with great cleverness;\r\nand the talk of all the people is natural and amusing, although at times\r\nthe solemn parts are not so well done as the lighter and more frivolous\r\nbits of the conversation. The book abounds with hits at social faults of\r\none kind and another, and shows a perception of the ridiculous which\r\npromises well for the future success of the writer. It is not a great\r\nbook, but it is a clever one, which belongs in the same category with\r\n_The Initials_; and every one has had, has, or will have a period of his\r\nor her life in which no more is asked than is to be found in that famous\r\nstory. In both books the characters have a great resemblance to human\r\nbeings as seen by a bright, observant, humorous person whose experience\r\nhas not been wasted. It is not everybody who has afterward been famous\r\nthat has made so good a beginning as the author of _Kismet_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received._\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrative of the North Pole Expedition: U.
