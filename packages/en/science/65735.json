The “Life and\r\nLetters of Faraday,” by Dr. Bence Jones, secretary of the Royal\r\nInstitution, which was issued in 1868 in two volumes, has long been\r\nout of print. “Faraday as a Discoverer,” written in 1868 by Professor\r\nTyndall, which, though slighter as a record, brings out many points of\r\ncharacter into striking relief, is also now exhausted. Dr. Gladstone’s\r\n“Michael Faraday,” published in 1872, so rich in reminiscences, and\r\nso appreciative of the moral and religious side of his character, is\r\nalso out of print. Other and briefer biographies exist; the “Éloge\r\nHistorique” of M. Dumas; the article “Faraday” in the “Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica” by Professor Clerk Maxwell; and the chapter on Faraday\r\nin Dr. W. Garnett’s “Heroes of Science.” But there seems room for\r\nanother account of the life and labours of the man whose influence\r\nupon the century in which he lived was so great. For forty years he\r\nwas a living and inspiring voice in the Royal Institution, beyond all\r\nquestion the greatest scientific expositor of his time. Throughout\r\nalmost the whole of that time his original researches in physics, and\r\nchiefly in electricity, were extending the boundaries of knowledge\r\nand laying the foundations not only for the great developments of\r\nelectrical engineering of the last twenty years but for those still\r\ngreater developments in the theories of electricity, magnetism, and\r\nlight which are every year being extended and made fruitful. Were there\r\nno other reason than these developments in practice and theory, they\r\nwould amply justify the effort to review now, after so many years, the\r\nposition of Faraday amongst the eminent men of the century now drawing\r\nto its close.\r\n\r\nThose who were intimately acquainted with him are a fast dwindling\r\nband. In the recollection of such as have survived him, his image lives\r\nand moves, surrounded with gracious memories, a vivid personality\r\ninstinct with rare and unselfish kindliness. But the survivors are few,\r\nand their ranks grow thinner with each succeeding year. And so it comes\r\nabout that the task of writing of his life and work has been entrusted\r\nto one who never ceases to regret that he never met Faraday.\r\n\r\nThanks to the permission of the managers of the Royal Institution,\r\na number of short extracts from Faraday’s notebooks, hitherto\r\nunpublished, are now printed for the first time. Much more remains\r\nwhich it is to be hoped, for the benefit of science, may be published\r\nere long. The author desires further to acknowledge the kindness\r\nof Messrs. Longmans & Co. in allowing the reproduction of the\r\nillustrations on pages 3 and 258, which are taken from Bence Jones’s\r\n“Life and Letters of Faraday,” published in 1868. Mr. Elkin Mathews has\r\nkindly permitted the insertion of the sonnet by Mr. Cosmo Monkhouse\r\nwhich follows the title-page. The author is also indebted to Dr. J.\r\nHall Gladstone, F.R.S., for many valuable notes and suggestions, and to\r\nMiss M. K. Reynolds for photographs used in preparing Fig. 14. Most of\r\nall he is indebted to Miss Jane Barnard for access to Faraday’s private\r\npapers, and for permission to print certain extracts from them.\r\n\r\n                                        S. P. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE\r\n  CHAP.

He was\r\nthe third child of his parents, James and Margaret Faraday, who had\r\nbut recently migrated to London from the little Yorkshire village of\r\nClapham. Clapham lies under the shadow of Ingleborough, on the western\r\nborder of the county, midway between Settle and Kirkby Lonsdale.\r\nThe father, James Faraday, was a working blacksmith; the mother,\r\ndaughter of a farmer of Mallerstang, the romantic valley which runs\r\npast Pendragon Castle to Kirkby Stephen. James Faraday was one of the\r\nten children of a Robert Faraday, who in 1756 had married Elizabeth\r\nDean, the owner of a small homestead known as Clapham Wood Hall, since\r\npulled down. All Robert Faraday’s sons appear to have been brought up\r\nto trades, one being a shoemaker, another a grocer, another a farmer,\r\nanother a flax-worker, and another a shopkeeper. Descendants of some of\r\nthese still live in the district.\r\n\r\nAfter Michael’s birth, his parents moved to the north side of the\r\nThames, living for a short time in Gilbert Street, but removing in\r\n1796 to rooms over a coach-house in Jacob’s Well Mews, Charles Street,\r\nManchester Square, where they lived till 1809. In that year, young\r\nMichael being now nearly eighteen years old, they moved to 18, Weymouth\r\nStreet, Portland Place. Here in the succeeding year James Faraday, who\r\nhad long been an invalid, died; his widow, who for some years remained\r\non at Weymouth Street, maintaining herself by taking in lodgers until\r\nher sons could support themselves and her, survived till 1838. Though\r\na capable woman and a good mother, she was quite uneducated. In her\r\ndeclining years she was wholly supported by her son, of whom she was\r\nvery proud, and to whom she was devoted.\r\n\r\nMichael received very little schooling. One of his nephews tells\r\nthe following tale of his boyhood. He was at a dame’s school; and,\r\neither from some defect in his speech or because he was too young\r\nto articulate his _r_’s properly, he pronounced his elder brother’s\r\nname “Wobert.” The harsh schoolmistress, bent on curing the defect by\r\npersonal chastisement, sent the aforesaid “Wobert” out with a halfpenny\r\nto get a cane, that young Michael might be duly flogged. But this\r\nrefinement of cruelty reacted on itself; for Robert, boiling with\r\nindignation, pitched the halfpenny over a wall, and went home to tell\r\nhis mother, who promptly came down to the scene of action and removed\r\nboth boys from the school. From the age of five to thirteen Michael\r\nlived at Jacob’s Well Mews, spending his out-of-school hours at home or\r\nin the streets playing at marbles and other games with the children of\r\nthe neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIEBAU’S SHOP.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOOKBINDER’S ERRAND-BOY.]\r\n\r\nIn 1804 he went on trial for twelve months as errand-boy to a\r\nbookseller and stationer at No. 2, Blandford Street--Mr. George Riebau.\r\nThis house, which is still kept as a stationer’s shop (by Mr. William\r\nPike), is now marked with an enamelled tablet recording its connection\r\nwith the life of Faraday.[1] When he first went to Mr. Riebau, it was\r\nhis duty to carry round the newspapers in the morning. He has been\r\ngraphically described as a bright-eyed errand-boy who “slid along the\r\nLondon pavements, with a load of brown curls upon his head and a packet\r\nof newspapers under his arm.” Some of the journals were lent out, and\r\nhad to be called for again. He was very particular on Sunday mornings\r\nto take them round early, that he might complete his work in time to\r\ngo with his parents to their place of worship. They belonged--as his\r\ngrandfather before him--to the sect known as Sandemanians, a small\r\nbody which separated from the Presbyterian Church of Scotland towards\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century. Their views, which were very\r\nprimitive, were held with intense earnestness and sincerity of purpose.\r\nTheir founder had taught that Christianity never was or could be the\r\nformal or established religion of any nation without subverting its\r\nessential principles; that religion was the affair of the individual\r\nsoul; and that “the Bible” alone, with nothing added to it or taken\r\naway from it by man, was the sole and sufficient guide for the soul.\r\nThey rejected all priests or paid ministers, but recognised an\r\ninstitution of unpaid eldership. Their worship was exceedingly simple.\r\nThough their numbers were few, they were exceedingly devout, simple,\r\nand exclusive in their faith. Doubtless the rigorous moral influences\r\npervading the family and friends of James Faraday had a great part in\r\nmoulding the character of young Michael. To his dying day he remained a\r\nmember of this obscure sect. As he was no merely nominal adherent, but\r\nan exceedingly devoted member, and at two different periods of his life\r\nan elder and a preacher, no review of his life-work would be complete\r\nwithout a fuller reference to the religious side of his character.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APPRENTICED AS BOOKBINDER.]\r\n\r\nAfter the year of trial, Michael Faraday was formally apprenticed to\r\nlearn the arts of bookbinder, stationer, “and bookseller,” to Mr.\r\nRiebau. The indenture[2] is dated October 7, 1805. It is stated that,\r\n“in consideration of his faithful service, no premium is given.” During\r\nhis seven years of apprenticeship there came unexpected opportunities\r\nfor self-improvement. Faraday’s lifelong friend and co-religionist,\r\nCornelius Varley, says:--“When my attention was first drawn to Faraday,\r\nI was told that he had been apprenticed to a bookbinder. I said he\r\nwas the best bookworm for eating his way to the inside; for hundreds\r\nhad worked at books only as so much printed paper. Faraday saw a mine\r\nof knowledge, and resolved to explore it.” To one of his friends he\r\nsaid that a book by Watts, “On the Mind,” first made him think, and\r\nthat the article on “Electricity” in a cyclopædia which came into his\r\nhands to be bound first turned his attention to science. He himself\r\nwrote:--“Whilst an apprentice I loved to read the scientific books\r\nwhich were under my hand; and, amongst them, delighted in Marcet’s\r\n‘Conversations in Chemistry’ and the electrical treatises in the\r\n‘Encyclopædia Britannica.’ I made such simple experiments in chemistry\r\nas could be defrayed in their expense by a few pence per week, and\r\nalso constructed an electrical machine, first with a glass phial, and\r\nafterwards with a real cylinder, as well as other electrical apparatus\r\nof a corresponding kind.” This early machine[3] is now preserved at\r\nthe Royal Institution, to which it was presented by Sir James South.\r\nAmongst the books which he had to bind were Lyons’ “Experiments on\r\nElectricity” and Boyle’s “Notes about the Producibleness of Chymicall\r\nPrinciples,” which books, together with Miss Burney’s “Evelina,” all\r\nbound with his own hands, are still preserved in the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEW ACQUAINTANCES.]\r\n\r\nWalking near Fleet Street, he saw displayed a bill announcing that\r\nevening lectures on natural philosophy were delivered by Mr. Tatum\r\nat 53, Dorset Street, Salisbury Square, E.C., price of admission one\r\nshilling. With his master’s permission, and money furnished by his\r\nelder brother Robert, who was a blacksmith and (later) a gasfitter,\r\nMichael began to taste scientific teaching. Between February, 1810,\r\nand September, 1811, he attended some twelve or thirteen lectures. He\r\nmade full and beautiful notes of all he heard: his notebooks, bound\r\nby himself, being still preserved. At these lectures he fell in with\r\nseveral thoroughly congenial comrades, one of them, by name Benjamin\r\nAbbott, being a well-educated young Quaker, who was confidential\r\nclerk in a mercantile house in the City. Of the others--amongst\r\nwhom were Magrath, Newton, Nicol, Huxtable, and Richard Phillips\r\n(afterwards F.R.S. and President of the Chemical Society)--several\r\nremained lifelong friends. Happily for posterity, the letters--long\r\nand chatty--which the lad wrote in the fulness of his heart to Abbott\r\nhave been preserved; they are published in Bence Jones’s “Life and\r\nLetters.” They are remarkable not only for their vivacity and freshness\r\nbut for their elevated tone and excellent composition--true specimens\r\nof the lost art of letter-writing. The most wonderful thing about them\r\nis that they should have been written by a bookbinder’s apprentice of\r\nno education beyond the common school of the district. In his very\r\nfirst letter he complains that ideas and notions which spring up in his\r\nmind “are irrevocably lost for want of noting at the time.” This seems\r\nthe first premonition of that loss of memory which so afflicted him\r\nin after life. In his later years he always carried in his waistcoat\r\npocket a card on which to jot down notes and memoranda. He would\r\nstop to set down his notes in the street, in the theatre, or in the\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\nRiebau, his master in the bookbinding business, seems, from the way\r\nhe encouraged the studies of his young apprentice, to have been no\r\nordinary man. His name would suggest a foreign extraction; and to his\r\nshop resorted more than one political refugee. There lodged at one time\r\nat Riebau’s an artist named Masquerier,[4] who had painted Napoleon’s\r\nportrait and had fled from France during the troublous times. For\r\nthe apprentice boy, who used to dust his room and black his boots,\r\nMasquerier took a strong liking. He lent him books on perspective\r\nand taught him how to draw. Another frequenter of Riebau’s shop was\r\na Mr. Dance, whose interest in the industry and intelligence of the\r\napprentice led him to an act which changed the whole destiny of his\r\nlife. Faraday himself, in the very few autobiographical notes which he\r\npenned, wrote thus:--\r\n\r\n    During my apprenticeship I had the good fortune, through the\r\n    kindness of Mr. Dance, who was a customer of my master’s shop\r\n    and also a member of the Royal Institution, to hear four of the\r\n    last lectures of Sir H. Davy in that locality.[5] The dates\r\n    of these lectures were February 29, March 14, April 8 and 10,\r\n    1812. Of these I made notes, and then wrote out the lectures in\r\n    a fuller form, interspersing them with such drawings as I could\r\n    make. The desire to be engaged in scientific occupation, even\r\n    though of the lowest kind, induced me, whilst an apprentice,\r\n    to write, in my ignorance of the world and simplicity of my\r\n    mind, to Sir Joseph Banks, then President of the Royal Society.\r\n    Naturally enough, “No answer” was the reply left with the\r\n    porter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LETTERS TO ABBOTT.]\r\n\r\nHe submitted his notes to the criticism of his friend Abbott, with whom\r\nhe discussed chemical and electrical problems, and the experiments\r\nwhich they had individually tried. Out of this correspondence, one\r\nletter only can be given; it was written September 28, 1812, ten days\r\nbefore the expiry of his apprenticeship:--\r\n\r\n    Dear A----, ... I will hurry on to philosophy, where I am a\r\n    little more sure of my ground. Your card was to me a very\r\n    interesting and pleasing object. I was highly gratified in\r\n    observing so plainly delineated the course of the electric\r\n    fluid or fluids (I do not know which). It appears to me that by\r\n    making use of a card thus prepared, you have hit upon a happy\r\n    illustrating medium between a conductor and a non-conductor;\r\n    had the interposed medium been a conductor, the electricity\r\n    would have passed in connection through it--it would not have\r\n    been divided; had the medium been a non-conductor, it would\r\n    have passed in connection, and undivided, as a spark over\r\n    it, but by this varying and disjoined conductor it has been\r\n    divided most effectually. Should you pursue this point at\r\n    any time still further, it will be necessary to ascertain by\r\n    what particular power or effort the spark is divided, whether\r\n    by its affinity to the conductor or by its own repulsion; or\r\n    if, as I have no doubt is the case, by the joint action of\r\n    these two forces, it would be well to observe and ascertain\r\n    the proportion of each in the effect. There are problems,\r\n    the solution of which will be difficult to obtain, but the\r\n    science of electricity will not be complete without them;\r\n    and a philosopher will aim at perfection, though he may not\r\n    hit it--difficulties will not retard him, but only cause a\r\n    proportionate exertion of his mental faculties.\r\n\r\n    I had a very pleasing view of the planet Saturn last week\r\n    through a refractor with a power of ninety. I saw his ring\r\n    very distinctly; ’tis a singular appendage to a planet, to\r\n    a revolving globe, and I should think caused some peculiar\r\n    phenomena to the planet within it. I allude to their mutual\r\n    action with respect to meteorology and perhaps electricity....\r\n\r\nThe master, a French emigré named De la Roche, of King Street, Portman\r\nSquare, to whom he engaged himself as a journeyman bookbinder, was of\r\na very passionate disposition, and made Faraday very uncomfortable. He\r\nlonged to get out of trade, and under the encouragement of Mr. Dance\r\nhe wrote to Sir Humphry Davy, sending, “as a proof of my earnestness,”\r\nthe notes he had taken of Davy’s last four lectures. Faraday’s letter,\r\nwhich has been preserved but never published, is an astounding example\r\nof the high-flown cringing style in vogue at that date. Davy’s reply\r\nwas favourable, and led to a temporary engagement of some days as\r\namanuensis at the time when he was wounded in the eye by an explosion\r\nof the chloride of nitrogen. Faraday himself, nearly twenty years\r\nafterwards, wrote[6] a full account of the circumstances.\r\n\r\n    [_M. Faraday to Dr. J. A. Paris._]\r\n\r\n                              Royal Institution, December 23, 1829.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,--You asked me to give you an account of my first\r\n    introduction to Sir H. Davy, which I am very happy to do, as I\r\n    think the circumstances will bear testimony to his goodness of\r\n    heart.\r\n\r\n    When I was a bookseller’s apprentice, I was very fond of\r\n    experiment and very adverse to trade. It happened that a\r\n    gentleman, a member of the Royal Institution, took me to hear\r\n    some of Sir H. Davy’s last lectures in Albemarle Street. I took\r\n    notes, and afterwards wrote them out more fairly in a quarto\r\n    volume.\r\n\r\n    My desire to escape from trade, which I thought vicious and\r\n    selfish, and to enter into the service of Science, which I\r\n    imagined made its pursuers amiable and liberal, induced me at\r\n    last to take the bold and simple step of writing to Sir H.\r\n    Davy, expressing my wishes, and a hope that, if an opportunity\r\n    came in his way, he would favour my views; at the same time, I\r\n    sent the notes I had taken of his lectures.\r\n\r\n    The answer, which makes all the point of my communication, I\r\n    send you in the original, requesting you to take great care of\r\n    it, and to let me have it back, for you may imagine how much I\r\n    value it.\r\n\r\n    You will observe that this took place at the end of the year\r\n    1812, and early in 1813 he requested to see me, and told me\r\n    of the situation of assistant in the laboratory of the Royal\r\n    Institution, then just vacant.\r\n\r\n    At the same time that he thus gratified my desires as to\r\n    scientific employment, he still advised me not to give up the\r\n    prospects I had before me, telling me that Science was a harsh\r\n    mistress; and in a pecuniary point of view but poorly rewarding\r\n    those who devoted themselves to her service. He smiled at my\r\n    notion of the superior moral feelings of philosophic men, and\r\n    said he would leave me to the experience of a few years to set\r\n    me right on that matter.\r\n\r\n    Finally, through his good efforts I went to the Royal\r\n    Institution early in March of 1813, as assistant in the\r\n    laboratory; and in October of the same year went with him\r\n    abroad as his assistant in experiments and in writing. I\r\n    returned with him in April, 1815, resumed my station in the\r\n    Royal Institution, and have, as you know, ever since remained\r\n    there.\r\n\r\n                              I am, dear Sir, very truly yours,\r\n                                                      M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WINS FAVOUR WITH DAVY.]\r\n\r\nThe following is Davy’s note:--\r\n\r\n    _Mr. P. Faraday, 188, Weymouth St., Portland Place._\r\n\r\n                                        December 24, 1812.\r\n\r\n    SIR,--I am far from displeased with the proof you have given\r\n    me of your confidence, and which displays great zeal, power\r\n    of memory, and attention. I am obliged to go out of Town, and\r\n    shall not be settled in town till the end of Jan^y I will then\r\n    see you at any time you wish. It would gratify me to be of any\r\n    service to you; I wish it may be in my power.\r\n\r\n                                              I am Sir\r\n                                        your obt. humble servt.\r\n                                                  H. DAVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Faraday called on Davy, who received him in the anteroom\r\nto the lecture theatre, by the window nearest to the corridor. He\r\nadvised him then to stick to bookbinding, promising to send him books\r\nfrom the Institution to bind, as well as other books. He must have been\r\nagreeably impressed, otherwise he would not, when disabled, have sent\r\nfor Faraday to write for him. Early in 1813 the humble household, in\r\nwhich Faraday lived with his widowed mother in Weymouth Street, was one\r\nnight startled by the apparition of Sir Humphry Davy’s grand coach,\r\nfrom which a footman alighted and knocked loudly at the door. For young\r\nFaraday, who was at that moment undressing upstairs, he left a note\r\nfrom Sir Humphry Davy requesting him to call next morning. At that\r\ninterview Davy asked him whether he was still desirous of changing his\r\noccupation, and offered him the post of assistant in the laboratory in\r\nplace of one who had been dismissed. The salary was to be twenty-five\r\nshillings a week, with two rooms at the top of the house. The minute\r\nappointing him is dated March 1, 1813:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENTERS ROYAL INSTITUTION.]\r\n\r\n    Sir Humphry Davy has the honour to inform the managers that\r\n    he has found a person who is desirous to occupy the situation\r\n    in the Institution lately filled by William Payne. His name\r\n    is Michael Faraday. He is a youth of twenty-two years of age.\r\n    As far as Sir H. Davy has been able to observe or ascertain,\r\n    he appears well fitted for the situation. His habits seem\r\n    good, his disposition active and cheerful, and his manner\r\n    intelligent. He is willing to engage himself on the same\r\n    terms as those given to Mr. Payne at the time of quitting the\r\n    Institution.\r\n\r\n    Resolved--That Michael Faraday be engaged to fill the situation\r\n    lately occupied by Mr. Payne on the same terms.[7]\r\n\r\nThere have come down several additions to the story. One, probably\r\napocryphal, says that Faraday’s first introduction to Davy was\r\noccasioned by Davy’s calling at Riebau’s to select some bookbinding,\r\nand seeing on the shelves the bound volume of manuscript notes of\r\nhis own lectures. The other was narrated by Gassiot to Tyndall, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                        Clapham Common, Surrey,\r\n                                                November 28, 1867.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR TYNDALL,--Sir H. Davy was accustomed to call on the\r\n    late Mr. Pepys in the Poultry, on his way to the London\r\n    Institution, of which Pepys was one of the original managers;\r\n    the latter told me that on one occasion Sir H. Davy, showing\r\n    him a letter, said, “Pepys, what am I to do?--here is a letter\r\n    from a young man named Faraday; he has been attending my\r\n    lectures, and wants me to give him employment at the Royal\r\n    Institution--what can I do?” “Do?” replied Pepys, “put him\r\n    to wash bottles; if he is good for anything he will do it\r\n    directly; if he refuses, he is good for nothing.” “No, no,”\r\n    replied Davy, “we must try him with something better than\r\n    that.” The result was, that Davy engaged him to assist in the\r\n    Laboratory at weekly wages.\r\n\r\n    Davy held the joint office of Professor of Chemistry and\r\n    Director of the Laboratory; he ultimately gave up the former to\r\n    the late Professor Brande, but he insisted that Faraday should\r\n    be appointed Director of the Laboratory, and, as Faraday told\r\n    me, this enabled him on subsequent occasions to hold a definite\r\n    position in the Institution, in which he was always supported\r\n    by Davy. I believe he held that office to the last.\r\n\r\n                    Believe me, my dear Tyndall, yours truly,\r\n                                                    J. P. GASSIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Mr. Tatum had founded a City Philosophical Society.[8] It\r\nconsisted of thirty or forty young men in humble or moderate rank, who\r\nmet on Wednesdays for mutual instruction; lectures being given once\r\na fortnight by the members in turn. Tatum introduced Faraday to this\r\nSociety in 1813. Edward Magrath was secretary. Amongst Faraday’s notes\r\nof his life is the following:--\r\n\r\n    During this spring Magrath and I established the\r\n    mutual-improvement plan, and met at my rooms up in the attics\r\n    of the Royal Institution, or at Wood Street at his warehouse.\r\n    It consisted perhaps of half-a-dozen persons, chiefly from\r\n    the City Philosophical Society, who met of an evening to read\r\n    together, and to criticise, correct, and improve each other’s\r\n    pronunciation and construction of language. The discipline was\r\n    very sturdy, the remarks very plain and open, and the results\r\n    most valuable. This continued for several years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AT WORK IN CHEMISTRY.]\r\n\r\nHe writes, after a week of work at the Royal Institution, to Abbott:--\r\n\r\n                              Royal Institution, March 8, 1813.\r\n\r\n    It is now about nine o’clock, and the thought strikes me that\r\n    the tongues are going both at Tatum’s and at the lecture in\r\n    Bedford Street; but I fancy myself much better employed than\r\n    I should have been at the lecture at either of those places.\r\n    Indeed, I have heard one lecture already to-day, and had a\r\n    finger in it (I can’t say a hand, for I did very little). It\r\n    was by Mr. Powell, on mechanics, or rather on rotatory motion,\r\n    and was a pretty good lecture, but not very fully attended.\r\n\r\n    As I know you will feel a pleasure in hearing in what I have\r\n    been or shall be occupied, I will inform you that I have been\r\n    employed to-day, in part, in extracting the sugar from a\r\n    portion of beetroot, and also in making a compound of sulphur\r\n    and carbon--a combination which has lately occupied in a\r\n    considerable degree the attention of chemists.\r\n\r\n    With respect to next Wednesday, I shall be occupied until late\r\n    in the afternoon by Sir H. Davy, and must therefore decline\r\n    seeing you at that time; this I am the more ready to do as I\r\n    shall enjoy your company next Sunday, and hope to possess it\r\n    often in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe next letter to Abbott, dated April 9, recounts an explosion in\r\nwhich both he and Sir Humphry Davy received considerable injury.\r\nIn June he wrote to Abbott four very remarkable letters concerning\r\nlectures and lecturers. He had already heard Tatum and Davy, and had\r\nnow assisted Brande and Powell in their lectures, and had keenly\r\nobserved their habits, peculiarities, and defects, as well as the\r\neffects they produced on the audience. He writes without the slightest\r\nsuspicion of suggestion that he himself has any likelihood of becoming\r\na lecturer, and says that he does not pretend to any of the requisites\r\nfor such an office. “If I am unfit for it,” he says, “’tis evident\r\nthat I have yet to learn; and how learn better than by the observation\r\nof others? If we never judge at all, we shall never judge right.” “I,\r\ntoo, have inducements in the C[ity] P[hilosophical] S[ociety] to draw\r\nme forward in the acquisition of a small portion of knowledge on this\r\npoint.” “I shall point out but few beauties or few faults that I have\r\nnot witnessed in the presence of a numerous assembly.”\r\n\r\nHe begins by considering the proper shape of a lecture-room; its proper\r\nventilation, and need of suitable entrances and exits. Then he goes\r\non to consider suitability of subjects and dignity of subject. In the\r\nsecond of the letters he contrasts the perceptive powers of the eye and\r\near, and the proper arrangements for a lecturer’s table; then considers\r\ndiagrams and illustrations. The third letter deals with the delivery\r\nand style of the lecture, the manner and attitudes of the lecturer, his\r\nmethods of keeping alive the attention of the audience, and duration of\r\nthe discourse. In the fourth of these letters (see p. 228), he dwells\r\non the mistakes and defects of lecturers, their unnecessary apologies,\r\nthe choice of apt experiments, and avoidance of trivialities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROPOSALS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL.]\r\n\r\nIn September, 1813, after but six months of work in the laboratory,\r\na proposition came to him from Sir Humphry Davy which resulted in\r\na complete change of scene. It was an episode of foreign travel,\r\nlasting, as it proved, eighteen months. In the autobiographical notes\r\nhe wrote:--\r\n\r\n    In the autumn Sir H. Davy proposed going abroad, and offered\r\n    me the opportunity of going with him as his amanuensis, and\r\n    the promise of resuming my situation in the Institution upon\r\n    my return to England. Whereupon I accepted the offer, left the\r\n    Institution on October 13, and, after being with Sir H. Davy in\r\n    France, Italy, Switzerland, the Tyrol, Geneva, &c., in that and\r\n    the following year, returned to England and London April 23,\r\n    1815.\r\n\r\nBefore he left England, on September 18, 1813, at the request of\r\nhis mother, he wrote to an uncle and aunt the following account of\r\nhimself:--\r\n\r\n    I was formerly a bookseller and binder, but am now turned\r\n    philosopher, which happened thus:--Whilst an apprentice, I,\r\n    for amusement, learnt a little of chemistry and other parts\r\n    of philosophy, and felt an eager desire to proceed in that\r\n    way further. After being a journeyman for six months, under\r\n    a disagreeable master, I gave up my business, and, by the\r\n    interest of Sir H. Davy, filled the situation of chemical\r\n    assistant to the Royal Institution of Great Britain, in\r\n    which office I now remain, and where I am constantly engaged\r\n    in observing the works of Nature and tracing the manner in\r\n    which she directs the arrangement and order of the world. I\r\n    have lately had proposals made to me by Sir Humphry Davy to\r\n    accompany him, in his travels through Europe and into Asia, as\r\n    philosophical assistant. If I go at all I expect it will be\r\n    in October next, about the end, and my absence from home will\r\n    perhaps be as long as three years. But as yet all is uncertain.\r\n    I have to repeat that, even though I may go, my path will not\r\n    pass near any of my relations, or permit me to see those whom I\r\n    so much long to see.\r\n\r\nTo Faraday, who was now twenty-two years old, foreign travel meant much\r\nmore than to most young men of equal age. With his humble bringing\r\nup and slender resources, he had never had the chance of seeing the\r\noutside world; he had never, to his own recollection, even seen the\r\nsea. When on Wednesday, October 13, he started out on the journey\r\nto Plymouth, in order to cross to the port of Morlaix, he began his\r\njournal of foreign travel thus:--\r\n\r\n    This morning formed a new epoch in my life. I have never\r\n    before, within my recollection, left London at a greater\r\n    distance than twelve miles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A NEW ELEMENT.]\r\n\r\nThis journal he kept with minute care, with the sole purpose of\r\nrecalling events to his mind. It gives full details as to Davy’s\r\nscientific friends and work, intermingled with graphic descriptions\r\nof scenery; and is remarkable also for its personal reticence. As\r\nwith many another, so with Faraday, foreign travel took in his life\r\nthe place of residence at a University. In France, in Italy, he\r\nreceived enlarged ideas; and what he saw of learned men and academies\r\nof science exercised no small formative effect upon one then at the\r\nmost impressionable age. He comments gaily on the odd incidents of\r\ntravel; the luminescence of the sea at night; the amazing fuss at the\r\nCustom House; the postilion with his jack-boots, whip, and pouch; the\r\nglow-worm (the first glow-worm he had ever seen); and the slim pigs of\r\nNormandy. At Paris he visits the Louvre, where his chief comment on\r\nits treasures is, that by their acquisition France has made herself\r\n“a nation of thieves.” He goes to the Prefecture of Police for his\r\npassport, in which he is described as having “a round chin, a brown\r\nbeard, a large mouth, a great nose,” etc. He visits the churches,\r\nwhere the theatrical air pervading the place “makes it impossible to\r\nattach a serious or important feeling to what is going on.” He comments\r\non the wood fires, the charcoal used in cooking, the washerwomen on\r\nthe river bank, the internal decorations of houses, the printing of\r\nthe books. Then he goes about with Davy amongst the French chemists.\r\nAmpère, Clément, and Désormes come to Davy to show him the new and\r\nstrange substance “X,” lately discovered by M. Courtois. They heat\r\nit, and behold it rise in vapour of a beautiful violet colour. Ampère\r\nhimself, on November 23rd, gives Davy a specimen. They carefully note\r\ndown its characters. Davy and his assistant make many new experiments\r\non it. At first its origin is kept a profound secret by the Frenchman.\r\nThen it transpires that it is made from ashes of seaweed. They work\r\non it at Chevreul’s laboratory. Faraday borrows a voltaic pile from\r\nChevreul. With that intuition which was characteristic of him, Davy\r\njumps almost at once to a conclusion as to the nature of the new body,\r\nwhich for nearly two years had been in the hands of the Frenchmen\r\nawaiting elucidation. When he leaves Paris, they do not wholly\r\nbless his rapidity of thought. But Faraday has seen--with placid\r\nindifference--a glimpse of the great Napoleon “sitting in one corner\r\nof his carriage, covered and almost hidden by an enormous robe of\r\nermine, and his face overshadowed by a tremendous plume of feathers,\r\nthat descended from a velvet hat”; he has also met Humboldt, and he has\r\nheard M. Gay Lussac lecture to about two hundred pupils.\r\n\r\nDumas has recorded in his “Éloge Historique” a reflection of the\r\nimpressions left by the travellers. After speaking of the criticism to\r\nwhich Davy was exposed during his visit, he says:--\r\n\r\n    His laboratory assistant, long before he had won his great\r\n    celebrity by his works, had by his modesty, his amiability,\r\n    and his intelligence, gained most devoted friends at Paris,\r\n    at Geneva, at Montpellier. Amongst these may be named in the\r\n    front rank M. de la Rive, the distinguished chemist, father of\r\n    the illustrious physicist whom we count amongst our foreign\r\n    associates. The kindnesses with which he covered my youth\r\n    contributed not a little to unite us--Faraday and myself.\r\n    With pleasure we used to recall that we made one another’s\r\n    acquaintance under the auspices of that affectionate and\r\n    helpful philosopher whose example so truly witnessed that\r\n    science does not dry up the heart’s blood. At Montpellier,\r\n    beside the hospitable hearth of Bérard, the associate of\r\n    Chaptal, doyen of our corresponding members, Faraday has left\r\n    memories equally charged with an undying sympathy which his\r\n    master could never have inspired. We admired Davy, we loved\r\n    Faraday.\r\n\r\nIt is December 29 when the travellers leave Paris and cross the forest\r\nof Fontainebleau. Faraday thinks he never saw a more beautiful scene\r\nthan the forest dressed in an airy garment of crystalline hoar frost.\r\nThey pass through Lyons, Montpellier, Aix, Nice, searching on the\r\nway for iodine in the sea-plants of the Mediterranean. At the end\r\nof January, 1814, they cross the Col de Tende over the snow at an\r\nelevation of 6,000 feet into Italy, and find themselves in the midst\r\nof the Carnival at Turin. They reach Genoa, and go to the house of a\r\nchemist to make experiments on the _raia torpedo_, the electric skate,\r\ntrying to ascertain whether water could be decomposed by the electrical\r\ndischarges of these singular fishes. From Genoa they go by sea to\r\nLerici in an open boat, with much discomfort and fear of ship-wreck;\r\nand thence by land to Florence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WITH DAVY IN ITALY.]\r\n\r\nAt Florence he goes with Davy to the Accademia del Cimento. He sees the\r\nlibrary, the gardens, the museum. Here is Galileo’s own telescope--a\r\nsimple tube of paper and wood, with lenses at each end--with which he\r\ndiscovered Jupiter’s satellites. Here is the great burning glass of the\r\nGrand Duke of Tuscany. And here is a numerous collection of magnets,\r\nincluding one enormous loadstone supporting a weight of 150 pounds.\r\nThey make “the grand experiment of burning the diamond” in oxygen by\r\nthe sun’s heat concentrated through the Grand Duke’s burning glass.\r\nThey find the diamond to be pure carbon. Then early in April they\r\ndepart for Rome.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome Faraday wrote to his mother a long chatty letter summarising\r\nhis travels, and sending messages of kindly remembrance to his\r\nold master Riebau and others. He tells how, in spite of political\r\ntroubles, Sir Humphry Davy’s high name has procured them free admission\r\neverywhere, and how they have just heard that Paris has been taken by\r\nthe Allied troops.\r\n\r\nAt Rome they witness unconvinced some attempts of Morichini to impart\r\nmagnetism to steel needles by the solar rays. They pass the Colosseum\r\nby moonlight, making an early morning start across the Campagna, on\r\nthe road to Naples, with an armed guard for fear of brigands. Twice,\r\nin the middle of May, they ascend Vesuvius, the second time during a\r\npartial eruption rendered all the more vivid by the lateness of the\r\nhour--half-past seven--at which the edge of the crater was reached. In\r\nJune they visit Terni, and note the nearly circular rainbow visible in\r\nthe spray of the cataract; and so across the Apennines to Milan.\r\n\r\nAt Milan occurs the following entry:--\r\n\r\n    Friday 17th [June, 1814], Milan. Saw M. Volta, who came to Sir\r\n    H. Davy, an hale elderly man, bearing the red ribbon, and very\r\n    free in conversation.\r\n\r\nHe does _not_ record how the ceremonious old Count, who had specially\r\nattired himself in his Court uniform to welcome the illustrious\r\nchemist, was horrified at the informal manners and uncourtly dress of\r\nthe tourist philosopher.\r\n\r\nSo, travelling by Como and Domo d’Ossola, they come to Geneva, and\r\nhere remain a long time; and Faraday writes again to his mother and\r\nto Abbott. He can even find time to discuss with the latter the\r\nrelative merits of the French and Italian languages, and the trend of\r\ncivilisation in Paris and in Rome. Twice he sends messages to Riebau.\r\nOne of his letters to Abbott, in September, contains passages of more\r\nthan transient interest:--\r\n\r\n    Some doubts have been expressed to me lately with respect\r\n    to the continuance of the Royal Institution; Mr. Newman can\r\n    probably give a guess at the issue of them. I have three boxes\r\n    of books, &c., there, and I should be sorry if they were lost\r\n    by the turning up of unforeseen circumstances; but I hope all\r\n    will end well (you will not read this out aloud). Remember\r\n    me to all friends, if you please. And “now for you and I to\r\n    ourselves.”...\r\n\r\n    In passing through life, my dear friend, everyone must expect\r\n    to receive lessons, both in the school of prosperity and in\r\n    that of adversity; and, taken in a general sense, these schools\r\n    do not only include riches and poverty, but everything that\r\n    may cause the happiness and pleasure of man, and every feeling\r\n    that may give him pain. I have been in at the door of both\r\n    these schools; nor am I so far on the right hand at present\r\n    that I do not get hurt by the thorns on my left. With respect\r\n    to myself, I have always perceived (when, after a time, I saw\r\n    things more clearly) that those things which at first appeared\r\n    as misfortunes or evils ultimately were actually benefits,\r\n    and productive of much good in the future progress of things.\r\n    Sometimes I compared them to storms and tempests, which cause a\r\n    temporary disarrangement to produce permanent good; sometimes\r\n    they appeared to me like roads--stony, uneven, hilly, and\r\n    uncomfortable, it is true--but the only roads to a good beyond\r\n    them; and sometimes I said they were clouds which intervened\r\n    between me and the sun of prosperity, but which I found were\r\n    refreshing, reserving to me that tone and vigour of mind which\r\n    prosperity alone would enervate and ultimately destroy....\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: HINTS OF DISCOMFORT.]\r\n\r\n    You talk of travelling, and I own the word is seducing, but\r\n    travelling does not secure you from uneasy circumstances. I\r\n    by no means intend to deter you from it; for though I should\r\n    like to find you at home when I come home, and though I know\r\n    how much the loss would be felt by our friends, yet I am aware\r\n    that the fund of knowledge and of entertainment opened would\r\n    be almost infinite. But I shall set down a few of my own\r\n    thoughts and feelings, &c., in the same circumstances. In the\r\n    first place, then, my dear B., I fancy that when I set my foot\r\n    in England I shall never take it out again; for I find the\r\n    prospect so different from what it at first appeared to be,\r\n    that I am certain, if I could have foreseen the things that\r\n    have passed, I should never have left London. In the second\r\n    place, enticing as travelling is--and I appreciate fully its\r\n    advantages and pleasures--I have several times been more\r\n    than half decided to return hastily home; but second thoughts\r\n    have still induced me to try what the future may produce, and\r\n    now I am only retained by the wish of improvement. I have\r\n    learned just enough to perceive my ignorance, and, ashamed of\r\n    my defects in everything, I wish to seize the opportunity of\r\n    remedying them. The little knowledge I have gained in languages\r\n    makes me wish to know more of them, and the little I have\r\n    seen of men and manners is just enough to make me desirous of\r\n    seeing more; added to which, the glorious opportunity I enjoy\r\n    of improving in the knowledge of chemistry and the sciences\r\n    continually determines me to finish this voyage with Sir\r\n    Humphry Davy. But if I wish to enjoy those advantages, I have\r\n    to sacrifice much; and though those sacrifices are such as an\r\n    humble man would not feel, yet I cannot quietly make them.\r\n    Travelling, too, I find, is almost inconsistent with religion\r\n    (I mean modern travelling), and I am yet so old-fashioned as\r\n    to remember strongly (I hope perfectly) my youthful education;\r\n    and upon the whole, _malgré_ the advantages of travelling, it\r\n    is not impossible but that you may see me at your door when you\r\n    expect a letter.\r\n\r\n    You will perceive, dear B., that I do not wish you hastily\r\n    to leave your present situation, because I think that a\r\n    hasty change will only make things worse. You will naturally\r\n    compare your situation with others you see around you, and\r\n    by this comparison your own will appear more sad, whilst the\r\n    others seem brighter than in truth they are; for, like the two\r\n    poles of a battery, the ideas of each will become exalted by\r\n    approaching them. But I leave you, dear friend, to act in this\r\n    case as your judgment may direct, hoping always for the best.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Sir Humphry works often on iodine, and has lately been making\r\n    experiments on the prismatic spectrum at M. Pictet’s. They\r\n    are not yet perfected, but from the use of very delicate air\r\n    thermometers, it appears that the rays producing most heat are\r\n    certainly out of the spectrum and beyond the red rays. Our time\r\n    has been employed lately in fishing and shooting; and many a\r\n    quail has been killed in the plains of Geneva, and many a\r\n    trout and grayling have been pulled out of the Rhone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I need not say, dear Ben, how perfectly I am yours,\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARISTOCRATIC HAUTEUR.]\r\n\r\nThis letter reveals, what the diary of travel so scrupulously hides,\r\nthe existence of circumstances which were hardly tolerable in Faraday’s\r\nposition. To make the reference intelligible it should be remembered\r\nthat Davy, who had come up to London in 1801 as a raw youth, of immense\r\nability but very uncouth exterior, had developed into a fashionable\r\nperson, had become the idol of the hour, had married a very wealthy\r\nwidow, had been knighted, and had given himself up very largely to the\r\npursuits of fashionable society and to the company of the aristocratic\r\n_beau monde_. Lady Davy accompanied Sir Humphry in this Continental\r\ntour; and though Faraday had been taken with them as secretary and\r\nscientific assistant, it would seem that he had not always been\r\ntreated with the respect due to one in that position. The above letter\r\nevidently disquieted Abbott, for he wrote back to Faraday to inquire\r\nmore closely into his personal affairs, telling him he was sure he\r\nwas not happy, and asking him to share his difficulties. Faraday, who\r\nwas now back in Rome, replied in January in a long letter of twelve\r\npages,[9] which he says he had intended to fill with an account of\r\nthe waterfalls he had seen, but which gives instead a detailed account\r\nof his vexations. He had, he said, written his former letter when\r\nin a ruffled state of mind. He now gives the explanation. Before,\r\nhowever, this letter could reach Abbott, the latter had written yet\r\nmore urgently to know what was the matter. To this Faraday replied\r\non February 23rd. As this shorter letter summarises the previous one\r\nit may be given here. Both are printed in Bence Jones’s “Life and\r\nLetters”:--\r\n\r\n                                        Rome, February 23, 1815.\r\n\r\n    DEAR B----,--In a letter of above twelve pages I gave answers\r\n    to your question respecting my situation. It was a subject\r\n    not worth talking about, but I consider your inquiries as so\r\n    many proofs of your kindness and the interest you take in my\r\n    welfare, and I thought the most agreeable thanks I could make\r\n    you would be to answer them. The same letter also contained a\r\n    short account of a paper written by Sir Humphry Davy on ancient\r\n    colours, and some other miscellaneous matters.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SECRET OF MORTIFICATION.]\r\n\r\n    I am quite ashamed of dwelling so often on my own affairs,\r\n    but as I know you wish it, I shall briefly inform you of my\r\n    situation. I do not mean to employ much of this sheet of paper\r\n    on the subject, but refer you to the before-mentioned long\r\n    letter for clear information. It happened a few days before we\r\n    left England, that Sir H.’s valet declined going with him, and\r\n    in the short space of time allowed by circumstances another\r\n    could not be got. Sir H. told me he was very sorry, but that,\r\n    if I would do such things as were absolutely necessary for him\r\n    until he got to Paris, he should there get another. I murmured,\r\n    but agreed. At Paris he could not get one. No Englishmen were\r\n    there, and no Frenchman fit for the place could talk English\r\n    to me. At Lyons he could not get one; at Montpellier he could\r\n    not get one; nor at Genoa, nor at Florence, nor at Rome, nor\r\n    in all Italy; and I believe at last he did not wish to get one:\r\n    and we are just the same now as we were when he left England.\r\n    This of course throws things into my duty which it was not\r\n    my agreement, and is not my wish, to perform, but which are,\r\n    if I remain with Sir H., unavoidable. These, it is true, are\r\n    very few; for having been accustomed in early years to do for\r\n    himself, he continues to do so at present, and he leaves very\r\n    little for a valet to perform; and as he knows that it is not\r\n    pleasing to me, and that I do not consider myself as obliged\r\n    to do them, he is always as careful as possible to keep those\r\n    things from me which he knows would be disagreeable. But Lady\r\n    Davy is of another humour. She likes to show her authority,\r\n    and at first I found her extremely earnest in mortifying me.\r\n    This occasioned quarrels between us, at each of which I gained\r\n    ground, and she lost it; for the frequency made me care nothing\r\n    about them, and weakened her authority, and after each she\r\n    behaved in a milder manner. Sir H. has also taken care to get\r\n    servants of the country, ycleped _lacquais de place_, to do\r\n    everything she can want, and now I am somewhat comfortable;\r\n    indeed, at this moment I am perfectly at liberty, for Sir H.\r\n    has gone to Naples to search for a house or lodging to which we\r\n    may follow him, and I have nothing to do but see Rome, write my\r\n    journal, and learn Italian.\r\n\r\n    But I will leave such an unprofitable subject, and tell you\r\n    what I know of our intended route. For the last few weeks\r\n    it has been very undecided, and at this moment there is no\r\n    knowing which way we shall turn. Sir H. intended to see Greece\r\n    and Turkey this summer, and arrangements were half made for\r\n    the voyage; but he has just learned that a quarantine must be\r\n    performed on the road there, and to do this he has an utter\r\n    aversion, and that alone will perhaps break up the journey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Since the long letter I wrote you, Sir H. has written two short\r\n    papers for the Royal Society--the first on a new solid compound\r\n    of iodine and oxygen, and the second a new gaseous compound of\r\n    chlorine and oxygen, which contains four times as much oxygen\r\n    as euchlorine.\r\n\r\n    The discovery of these bodies contradicts many parts of\r\n    Gay-Lussac’s paper on iodine, which has been very much vaunted\r\n    in these parts. The French chemists were not aware of the\r\n    importance of the subject until it was shown to them, and now\r\n    they are in haste to reap all the honours attached to it; but\r\n    their haste opposes their aim. They reason theoretically,\r\n    without demonstrating experimentally, and errors are the result.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    I am, my dear Friend, yours ever and faithfully,\r\n                                                           M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equivocal position thus forced upon Faraday by the _hauteur_ of\r\nLady Davy nearly caused a _contretemps_ during the stay at Geneva,\r\nwhich lasted from the end of June, 1814, to about the middle of\r\nSeptember. Bence Jones’s account, derived from Faraday himself, is\r\nas follows:--Professor G. de la Rive, undazzled by the brilliancy of\r\nDavy’s reputation, was able to see the true worth of his assistant.\r\nDavy was fond of shooting, and Faraday, who accompanied them, used to\r\nload Davy’s gun for him, while De la Rive loaded his own. Entering\r\ninto conversation with Faraday, De la Rive was astonished to find that\r\nthe intelligent and charming young man whom he had taken hitherto\r\nfor a domestic was really _préparateur de laboratoire_ in the Royal\r\nInstitution. This led him to place Faraday, in one respect, on an\r\nequality with Davy. Whilst they were staying in his house, he wished\r\nthem to dine together at his table. Davy, it is said, declined, because\r\nFaraday acted in some things as his servant. De la Rive expressed his\r\nfeelings strongly, and ordered dinner in a separate room for Faraday.\r\nA rumour spread years after that De la Rive gave a dinner in Faraday’s\r\nhonour: this is not so, however.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VISIT TO GENEVA.]\r\n\r\nOf that Geneva visit Faraday says, in 1858, to M. A. de la Rive:--\r\n\r\n    I have some such thoughts (of gratitude) even as regards your\r\n    own father, who was, I may say, the first who personally at\r\n    Geneva, and afterwards by correspondence, encouraged and by\r\n    that sustained me.\r\n\r\nThis correspondence, which began with the father and was continued with\r\nthe son, lasted altogether nearly fifty years.\r\n\r\nFrom Geneva the travellers went northward, by Lausanne, Vevay, Bern,\r\nZürich, and Schaffhausen, across Baden and Würtemburg to Munich. After\r\nvisiting this and other German towns, they crossed Tyrol southwards to\r\nVicenza, halting in the neighbourhood of the Pietra Mala to collect the\r\ninflammable gas which there rises from the soil. They spent a day in\r\nPadua, and three days in Venice; and on by Bologna to Florence, where\r\nDavy completed his analysis of the gas collected at Pietra Mala. Early\r\nin November they were again in Rome. He writes once and again to his\r\nmother, while his anxiety about the Royal Institution makes him send\r\ninquiries to Abbott as to what is going to happen there, and to charge\r\nhim, “if any change should occur in Albemarle Street,” not to forget\r\nhis books which are lying there. “I prize them now more than ever.”\r\n\r\nTo his former master, Riebau, he wrote from Rome as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                        Rome, Jan. 5th, 1815.\r\n\r\n                                        HONOURED SIR,\r\n\r\n    It is with very peculiar but very pleasing and indeed\r\n    flattering sentiments that I commence a letter intended for\r\n    you, for I esteem it as a high honour that you should not only\r\n    allow but even wish me to write to you. During the whole of\r\n    the short eight years that I was with you, Sir, and during\r\n    the year or two that passed afterwards before I left England,\r\n    I continually enjoyed your goodness and the effects of it;\r\n    and it is gratifying to me in the highest degree to find that\r\n    even absence has not impaired it, and that you are willing to\r\n    give me the highest proof of (allow me to say) friendship that\r\n    distance will admit. I have received both the letters that you\r\n    have wrote to me, Sir, and consider them as far from being the\r\n    least proofs of your goodwill and remembrance of me. Allow\r\n    me to thank you humbly but sincerely for these and all other\r\n    kindness, and I hope that at some future day an opportunity\r\n    will occur when I can express more strongly my gratitude.\r\n\r\n    I beg leave to return a thousand thanks to my kind Mistress,\r\n    to Mr. and Mrs. Paine and George for their remembrances, and\r\n    venture to give mine with respect in return. I am very glad to\r\n    hear that all are well. I am very much afraid you say too much\r\n    of me to Mr. Dance, Mr. Cosway, Mrs. Udney, etc., for I feel\r\n    unworthy of what you have said of me formerly, and what you\r\n    may say now. Since I have left England, the experience I have\r\n    gained in more diversified and extended life, and the knowledge\r\n    I have gained of what is to be learned and what others know,\r\n    have sufficiently shown me my own ignorance, the degree in\r\n    which I am surpassed by all the world, and my want of powers;\r\n    but I hope that at least I shall return home with an addition\r\n    to my self-knowledge. When speaking of those who are so much\r\n    my superiors, as Mr. Dance, Mr. Cosway, and Mrs. Udney, etc.,\r\n    I feel a continual fear that I should appear to want respect,\r\n    but the manner in which you mention their names in your letter\r\n    emboldens me to beg that you will give my humblest respects\r\n    to those honored persons, if, and only if (I am afraid of\r\n    intruding) they should again speak of me to you. Mr. Dance’s\r\n    kindness claims my gratitude, and I trust that my thanks, the\r\n    only mark that I can give, will be accepted.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: BOOKS AND BOOKSELLERS.]\r\n\r\n    Since I have been abroad, my old profession of books has\r\n    oftentimes occurred to my mind and been productive of much\r\n    pleasure. It was my wish at first to purchase some useful book\r\n    at every large town we came to, but I found my stock increase\r\n    so fast that I was obliged to alter my plan and purchase only\r\n    at Capital Cities. The first books that I wanted were grammars\r\n    and dictionaries, but I found few places like London where I\r\n    could get whatever I wanted. In France (at the time we were\r\n    there) English books were very scarce, and also English and\r\n    French books; and a French grammar for an Englishman was a\r\n    thing difficult to find. Nevertheless the shops appeared well\r\n    stocked with books in their own language, and the encouragement\r\n    Napoleon gave to Arts and Sciences extended its influence even\r\n    to the printing and binding of books. I saw some beautiful\r\n    specimens in both these branches at the Bibliothèque Impériale\r\n    at Paris, but I still think they did not exceed or even equal\r\n    those I had seen in London before. We have as yet seen very\r\n    little of Germany, having passed rapidly through Switzerland\r\n    and stopping but a few days at Munich, but that little gave\r\n    me a very favorable idea of the Booksellers’ shops. I got an\r\n    excellent English and German dictionary immediately I asked for\r\n    it, and other books I asked for I found were to be had, but E.\r\n    and G. Grammars were scarce, owing to the little communication\r\n    between the two Empires, and the former power of the French\r\n    in Germany. Italy I have found the country furnished with\r\n    the fewest means--if books are the means of disseminating\r\n    knowledge, and even Venice which is renowned for Printing\r\n    appeared to me bare and little worthy of its character. It is\r\n    natural to suppose that the great and most estimable use of\r\n    printing is to produce those books which are in most general\r\n    use and which are required by the world at large; it is those\r\n    books which form this branch of trade, and consequently every\r\n    shop in it gives an account of the more valuable state of the\r\n    art (_i.e._) the use made of it. In Italy there are many\r\n    books, and the shelves of the shops there appear full, but the\r\n    books are old, or what is new have come from France; they seem\r\n    latterly to have resigned printing and to have become satisfied\r\n    with the libraries their forefathers left them. I found at\r\n    Florence an E. and I. Grammar (Veneroni’s), which does a little\r\n    credit to Leghorn; but I have searched unsuccessfully at Rome,\r\n    Naples, Milan, Bologna, Venice, Florence, and in every part of\r\n    Italy for and E. and I. Dictionary, and the only one I could\r\n    get was Rollasetti in 8vo. E. F. and I. A circumstance still\r\n    more singular is the want of bibles; even at Rome, the seat of\r\n    the Roman Catholic faith, a bible of moderate size is not to\r\n    be found, either Protestant or Catholic. Those which exist are\r\n    large folios or 4tos and in several volumes, interspersed with\r\n    the various readings and commentaries of the fathers, and they\r\n    are in the possession of the Priests and religious professors.\r\n    In all shops at Rome where I ask for a small pocket bible the\r\n    man seemed afraid to answer me, and some Priest in the shop\r\n    looked at me in a very inquisitive way.\r\n\r\n    I must now, Kind Sir, put an end to this letter, which I fear\r\n    you will think already too long. I beg you will have the\r\n    goodness to send to my Mother and say I am well, and give my\r\n    duty to her and my love to my brother and sisters. I have\r\n    wrote four or five times lately from Rome to various friends.\r\n    Remember me, if you please, to Mr. Kitchen, and others who may\r\n    enquire after me. I thank you for your concluding wishes and\r\n    am, Sir,\r\n\r\n                                        Your most dutifully,\r\n                                                        FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his sisters he wrote also. To the elder, on the Church festivals,\r\nthe Carnival, and the ruins of the Colosseum. To the younger, on the\r\nbest way of learning French. His diary is full of the Carnival, the\r\nfoolishness of which afforded him much amusement. He witnessed the\r\nhorse-races in the Corso, went four times to masked balls, where his\r\nboyish love of uproarious fun broke out beyond restraint, for to the\r\nlast one he went disguised in a night-gown and night-cap. Between\r\ngaieties in the evenings and chemical experiments with Davy in the\r\nday, his time must have been pretty fully occupied. They had had the\r\nintention of going on to Greece and Turkey, but owing to dread of\r\nquarantine these projects were abandoned, and at the end of February,\r\n1815, they moved southwards to Naples. Here is a characteristic entry:--\r\n\r\n    Tuesday, March 7th.--I heard for news that Bonaparte was again\r\n    at liberty. Being no politician, I did not trouble myself much\r\n    about it, though I suppose it will have a strong influence on\r\n    the affairs of Europe.\r\n\r\nHe went with Sir Humphry to explore Monte Somma, and ventured to make\r\nanother ascent of the cone of Vesuvius, with the gratification of\r\nfinding the crater in much greater activity than during the visits of\r\nthe preceding year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE END OF THE TOUR.]\r\n\r\nThen, for reasons not altogether clear, the tour was suddenly cut\r\nshort. Naples was left on March 21st, Rome on 24th, Mantua was passed\r\non 30th. Tyrol was recrossed, Germany traversed by Stuttgardt,\r\nHeidelberg, and Cologne. Brussels was reached on 16th April, whence\r\nLondon was regained _viâ_ Ostend and Deal. A letter written from\r\nBrussels to his mother positively overflows with the joy of expected\r\nreturn. He does not want his mother to be inquiring at Albemarle Street\r\nas to when he is expected:--\r\n\r\n    You may be sure that my first moments will be in your company.\r\n    If you have opportunities, tell some of my dearest friends,\r\n    but do not tell everybody--that is, do not trouble yourself to\r\n    do it. I am of no consequence except to a few, and there are\r\n    but a few that are of consequence to me, and there are some\r\n    whom I should like to be the first to tell myself--Mr. Riebau\r\n    for one. However, let A. know, if you can...\r\n\r\n    Adieu till I see you, dearest Mother; and believe me ever your\r\n    affectionate and dutiful son,\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n    [P.S.] ’Tis the shortest and (to me) the sweetest letter I ever\r\n    wrote you.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after his return to London, Faraday was re-engaged, at\r\na salary of thirty shillings a week, at the Royal Institution as\r\nassistant in the laboratory and mineralogical collection. He returned\r\nto the scene of his former labours; but with what widened ideas! He\r\nhad had eighteen months of daily intercourse with the most brilliant\r\nchemist of the age. He had seen and conversed with Ampère, Arago,\r\nGay-Lussac, Chevreul, Dumas, Volta, De la Rive, Biot, Pictet, De\r\nSaussure, and De Stael. He had formed a lasting friendship with more\r\nthan one of these. He had dined with Count Rumford, the founder of\r\nthe Royal Institution. He had gained a certain mastery over foreign\r\ntongues, and had seen the ways of foreign society. Though it was many\r\nyears before he again quitted England for a foreign tour, he cherished\r\nthe most lively recollection of many of the incidents that had befallen\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLIFE AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the scientific societies of Great Britain, the Royal\r\nInstitution of London occupies a conspicuous place. It has had many\r\nimitators in its time, yet it remains unique. A “learned society”\r\nit may claim to be, in the sense that it publishes scientific\r\ntransactions, and endeavours to concentrate within itself and promote\r\nthe highest science, within a certain range of subjects. In some\r\nrespects it resembles a college; for it appoints professors, and\r\nprovides them with space, appliances, and materials for research, and a\r\ntheatre wherein to lecture. For its members it provides a comfortable,\r\nwell-stocked library, and a reading-room where daily and periodic\r\njournals may be consulted. But it has achieved a reputation far in\r\nexcess of any it would have held, had that reputation depended solely\r\non its publications, or on the numerical strength of its membership.\r\n\r\nFounded in the year 1799 by that erratic genius Count Rumford, as a\r\nsort of technical school,[10] it would speedily have come to an end\r\nhad not others stepped in to develop it in new ways. From the certain\r\nruin which seemed impending in 1801, it was saved by the appearance\r\nupon the scene of the brilliant youth Humphry Davy, whose lectures\r\nmade it for ten years the resort of fashion. In 1814 it was again in\r\nsuch low water that Faraday, travelling on the Continent at that time\r\nas amanuensis to Sir Humphry, was every month expecting to hear of its\r\ncollapse. Until about 1833, when the two Fullerian Professorships were\r\nfounded, it was continually in financial difficulties. The persistent\r\nand extraordinary efforts made by Faraday from 1826 to 1839, and\r\nthe reputation of the place which accrued by his discoveries, were\r\nbeyond all question its salvation from ruin. When it was founded it\r\nwas located in two private houses in Albemarle Street, then regarded\r\nas quite out of town, if not almost suburban; the premises being\r\naltered and an entrance hall with staircase added. A little later the\r\nlecture-theatre, much as it still exists, was constructed. The exterior\r\nat first remained unchanged. The stucco pilasters of Grecian style,\r\nwhich give it its air of distinction, were not erected until 1838.\r\nThe fine rooms of the Davy-Faraday laboratory at the south end were\r\nonly added in 1896 by the liberality of Mr. Ludwig Mond. Besides the\r\nlaboratories for research in physical chemistry, which have thus been\r\nassociated with the older part of the Institution, additional rooms for\r\nthe library have been provided in this munificent gift to science. The\r\nolder laboratories of the Institution, though they retain some features\r\nfrom Rumford’s time, have been considerably remodelled. The old rooms\r\nwhere Davy, Young, Brande, Faraday, Frankland, and Tyndall conducted\r\ntheir researches are still in existence; but the chief laboratory was\r\nreconstructed in 1872 in Tyndall’s time; and it has been quite recently\r\nenlarged and reconstructed to accommodate the heavy machinery required\r\nin Professor Dewar’s researches on liquid air and the properties of\r\nbodies at low temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the place may be summed up very briefly. It has existed\r\nfor a century as the home of the highest kind of scientific research,\r\nand of the best and most specialised kind of scientific lectures.\r\nIt was here that Davy first showed the electric arc lamp; that he\r\nastonished the world by decomposing potash and producing potassium;\r\nthat he invented the safety lamp. It was here that Faraday worked and\r\nlaboured for nearly fifty years. Here that Tyndall’s investigations\r\non radiant heat and diamagnetism were carried on. Here that Brande,\r\nFrankland, Odling, Gladstone, and Dewar have handed on the torch\r\nof chemistry from the time of Davy. Professorships, of which the\r\neducational duties are restricted to a few lectures in the year,\r\ngiving leisure and scope for research as the main duty, are not to\r\nbe found anywhere else in the British Islands; those at colleges\r\nand universities being invariably hampered with educational and\r\nadministrative duties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROYAL INSTITUTION LABORATORIES.]\r\n\r\nAs for the lectures at the Royal Institution, they may be divided under\r\nthree heads: the afternoon courses; the juvenile lectures at Christmas;\r\nthe Friday night discourses. The afternoon lectures are thrice a week\r\nat three o’clock, and consist usually of short courses, from three\r\nlectures to as many as twelve, by eminent scientific and literary men.\r\nInvariably one of these courses during the season, either before or\r\nafter Easter, is given by one of the regular Professors; the remaining\r\nlecturers are paid professional fees in proportion to the duration of\r\ntheir course. The Christmas lectures, always six in number, are given,\r\nsometimes by one of the Professors, sometimes by outside lecturers\r\nof scientific reputation. But the Friday night discourses, given at\r\nnine o’clock, during the season from January till June, are unique.\r\nNo fee is paid to the lecturer, save a contribution toward expenses\r\nif applied for, and it is considered to be a distinct honour to be\r\ninvited to give such a discourse. There is no scientific man of any\r\noriginal claim to distinction; no chemist, engineer, or electrician; no\r\nphysiologist, geologist, or mineralogist, during the last fifty years,\r\nwho has not been invited thus to give an account of his investigations.\r\nOccasionally a wider range is taken, and the eminent writer of books,\r\ndramatist, metaphysician, or musician has taken his place at the\r\nlecture-table. The Friday night gathering is always a brilliant one.\r\nFrom the _salons_ of society, from the world of politics and diplomacy,\r\nas well as from the ranks of the learned professions and of the fine\r\narts, men and women assemble to listen to the exposition of the latest\r\ndiscoveries or the newest advances in philosophy by the men who have\r\nmade them. Every discourse must, so far as the subject admits, be\r\nillustrated in the best possible way by experiments, by diagrams, by\r\nthe exhibition of specimens. Not infrequently, the person invited to\r\ngive a Friday evening discourse at the Royal Institution will begin\r\nhis preparations five or six months beforehand. At least one instance\r\nis known--the occasion being a discourse by the late Mr. Warren De la\r\nRue--where the preparations were begun more than a year beforehand, and\r\ncost several hundreds of pounds. And this was to illustrate a research\r\nalready made and completed, of which the bare scientific results had\r\nalready been communicated in a memoir to the Royal Society. A mere\r\nenumeration of the eminent men who have thus given their time and\r\nlabours to the Royal Institution would fill many pages. It is little\r\ncause for wonder then that the lecture-theatre at Albemarle Street is\r\ncrowded week after week in the pursuit of science under conditions like\r\nthese; or that every lecturer is spurred on by the spirit of the place\r\nto do his subject the utmost justice by the manner in which he handles\r\nit. There are no lectures so famous, in the best sense of the word so\r\npopular, certainly none sustained at so high a level, as the lectures\r\nof the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FAMOUS LECTURES.]\r\n\r\nBut it was not always thus. Davy’s brilliant but ill-balanced genius\r\nhad drawn fashionable crowds to the morning lectures which he gave.\r\nBrande proved to be a much more humdrum lecturer; and though with young\r\nFaraday at his elbow he found his work of lecturing a task “on velvet,”\r\nhe was not exactly an inspiring person. During Davy’s protracted tour\r\nabroad things had not altogether prospered, and his return was none\r\ntoo soon. Faraday threw himself whole-heartedly into the work of the\r\nInstitution, not only helping as lecture assistant, but giving a hand\r\nalso in the preparation of the _Quarterly Journal of Science_, which\r\nhad been established as a kind of journal of proceedings.\r\n\r\nBut now Faraday was to take a quiet step forward. He appears at the\r\nCity Philosophical Society in the character of lecturer. He gave\r\nseven lectures there, in 1816, on chemistry, the fourth of them being\r\n“On Radiant Matter.” Extracts are given from most of these lectures\r\nin Bence Jones’s “Life and Letters of Faraday”; they show all that\r\nlove of accuracy, that philosophic suspense of judgment in matters of\r\nhypothesis, which in after years were so characteristic of the man.\r\n\r\nHe also kept a commonplace book filled with notes of scientific\r\nmatters, with literary excerpts, anagrams, epitaphs, algebraic puzzles,\r\nvarieties of spelling of his own name, and personal experiences,\r\nincluding a poetical diatribe against falling in love, together with\r\nthe following more prosaic aphorism:--\r\n\r\n    What is Love?--A nuisance to everybody but the parties\r\n    concerned. A private affair which every one but those concerned\r\n    wishes to make public.\r\n\r\nIt also includes a piece in verse, by a member of the City\r\nPhilosophical Society--a Mr. Dryden--called “Quarterly Night,” which\r\nis interesting as embalming a portrait of the youthful Faraday as he\r\nappeared to his comrades:--\r\n\r\n  Neat was the youth in dress, in person plain;\r\n  His eye read thus, _Philosopher in grain_;\r\n  Of understanding clear, reflection deep;\r\n  Expert to apprehend, and strong to keep.\r\n  His watchful mind no subject can elude,\r\n  Nor specious arts of sophists ere delude;\r\n  His powers, unshackled, range from pole to pole;\r\n  His mind from error free, from guilt his soul.\r\n  Warmth in his heart, good humour in his face,\r\n  A friend to mirth, but foe to vile grimace;\r\n  A temper candid, manners unassuming,\r\n  Always correct, yet always unpresuming.\r\n  Such was the youth, the chief of all the band;\r\n  His name well known, Sir Humphry’s right hand.\r\n\r\nAt this date there were no evening duties at the Royal Institution, but\r\nFaraday found his evenings well occupied, as he explains to Abbott when\r\nrallied about his having deserted his old friend. Monday and Thursday\r\nevenings he spent in self-improvement according to a regular plan.\r\nWednesdays he gave to “the Society” (_i.e._ the City Philosophical).\r\nSaturdays he spent with his mother at Weymouth Street; leaving only\r\nTuesdays and Fridays for his own business and friends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CITY PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.]\r\n\r\nAnd so the busy months pass, and he gives more lectures in the privacy\r\nof the City Society, one of them, “On some Observations on the Means\r\nof obtaining Knowledge,” attaining the dignity of print at the hands\r\nof Effingham Wilson, the enterprising City publisher, who a few\r\nyears later printed Browning’s “Paracelsus” and Alfred Tennyson’s\r\nfirst volume, “Poems: Chiefly Lyrical.” By the time he has given\r\nnine lectures he has gained confidence. The discourses had all been\r\nwritten out beforehand, though never literally “read.” For the tenth\r\nlecture--on Carbon--he wrote notes only. This is in July, 1817, and in\r\nthese notes he touches on a matter in which he had been very busily\r\naiding Sir Humphry Davy, the invention of the safety lamp. Many\r\nof the early forms of experimental apparatus constructed, and some\r\nof the early lamps, are still preserved in the museum of the Royal\r\nInstitution. Dr. Clanny had, in 1813, proposed an entirely closed lamp,\r\nsupplied with air from the mine, through water, by bellows. After many\r\nexperiments on explosive mixtures of gas and air, and on the properties\r\nof flame, Davy adopted an iron-wire gauze protector for his lamp, which\r\nwas introduced into coal mining early in 1816. In Davy’s preface to\r\nhis work describing it, he says: “I am myself indebted to Mr. Michael\r\nFaraday for much able assistance in the prosecution of my experiments.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A RIFT WITHIN THE LUTE.]\r\n\r\nAnd well might Davy be grateful. With all his immense ability, he\r\nwas a man almost destitute of the faculties of order and method. He\r\nhad little self-control, and the fashionable dissipations which he\r\npermitted himself lessened that little. Faraday not only kept his\r\nexperiments going, but made himself responsible for their records. He\r\npreserved every note and manuscript of Davy’s with religious care.\r\nHe copied out Davy’s scrawled researches in a neat clear delicate\r\nhandwriting, begging only for his pains to be allowed to keep the\r\noriginals, which he bound in two quarto volumes. Faraday has been known\r\nto remark to an intimate friend that amongst his advantages he had had\r\nbefore him a model to teach him what he should avoid. But he was ever\r\nloyal to Davy, earnest in his praise, and frank in his acknowledgment\r\nof his debt to his master in science. Still there arose the little rift\r\nwithin the lute. The safety lamp, great as was the practical advantage\r\nit brought to the miner, is not safe in all circumstances. Davy did\r\nnot like to admit this, and would never acknowledge it. Examined before\r\na Parliamentary Committee as to whether under a certain condition\r\nthe safety lamp would become unsafe, Faraday admitted that this was\r\nthe case. Not even his devotion to his master would induce him to\r\nhide the truth. He was true to himself in making the acknowledgment,\r\nthough it angered his master. One Friday evening at the Royal\r\nInstitution--probably about 1826--there was exhibited an improved Davy\r\nlamp with a eulogistic inscription; Faraday added in pencil the words:\r\n“The opinion of the inventor.”\r\n\r\nAt this time he began to give private lessons in chemistry to a pupil\r\nto whom he had been recommended by Davy. His lectures at the City\r\nSociety in Dorset Street were continued in 1818, and at the conclusion\r\nof those on chemistry he delivered one on “Mental Inertia,” which has\r\nbeen recorded at some length by Bence Jones.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 he attended a course of lessons on oratory by the elocutionist\r\nMr. B. H. Smart, paying out of his slender resources half a guinea a\r\nlesson, so anxious was he to improve himself, even in his manner of\r\nlecturing. His notes on these lessons fill 133 manuscript pages.\r\n\r\nHis other notes now begin to partake less of the character of\r\nquotations and excerpts, and more of the nature of queries or problems\r\nfor solution. Here are some examples:--\r\n\r\n    “Do the pith balls diverge by the disturbance of electricity in\r\n    consequence of mutual induction or not?”\r\n\r\n    “Distil oxalate of ammonia. Query, results?”\r\n\r\n    “Query, the nature of the body Phillips burns in his spirit\r\n    lamp?”\r\n\r\nThe Phillips here mentioned was the chemist Richard Phillips\r\n(afterwards President of the Chemical Society), one of his City\r\nfriends, whose name so frequently occurs in the correspondence of\r\nFaraday’s middle life. Phillips busied himself to promote the material\r\ninterests of his friend who--to use his own language--was “constantly\r\nengaged in observing the works of Nature, and tracing the manner in\r\nwhich she directs the arrangement and order of the world,” on the\r\nsplendid salary of £100 per annum. The following note in a letter to\r\nAbbott, dated February 27, 1818, reveals new professional labours:--\r\n\r\n    I have been more than enough employed. We have been obliged\r\n    even to put aside lectures at the Institution; and now I am so\r\n    tired with a long attendance at Guildhall yesterday and to-day,\r\n    being subpœnaed, with Sir H. Davy, Mr. Brande, Phillips, Aikin,\r\n    and others, to give chemical information on a trial (which,\r\n    however, did not come off), that I scarcely know what I say.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Davy again went abroad, but Faraday remained in\r\nEngland. From Rome Davy wrote a note, the concluding sentence of which\r\nshows how Faraday was advancing in his esteem:--\r\n\r\n                                        Rome: October, 1818.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hatchett’s letter contained praises of you which were\r\n    very gratifying to me; for, believe me, there is no one more\r\n    interested in your success and welfare than your sincere\r\n    well-wisher and friend,\r\n\r\n                                        H. DAVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the next year Davy wrote again, suggesting to Faraday that he might\r\npossibly be asked to come to Naples as a skilled chemist to assist in\r\nthe unrolling of the Herculaneum manuscripts. In May he wrote again,\r\nfrom Florence:--\r\n\r\n    It gives me great pleasure to hear that you are comfortable at\r\n    the Royal Institution, and I trust that you will not only do\r\n    something good and honourable for yourself, but likewise for\r\n    science.\r\n\r\n    I am, dear Mr. Faraday, always your sincere friend and\r\n    well-wisher,\r\n\r\n                                        H. DAVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wish that Davy expressed that Faraday might “do something”\r\nfor himself and likewise for science was destined soon to come to\r\nfulfilment. But in the case of one who had worked so closely and had\r\nbeen so intimately associated as an assistant, it must necessarily be\r\nno easy matter always to draw a distinction between the work of the\r\nmaster and that of the assistant. Ideas suggested by one might easily\r\nhave occurred to the other, when their thoughts had so long been\r\ndirected to the same ends. And so it proved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEGINS ORIGINAL RESEARCHES.]\r\n\r\nReference to Chapter III. will show that already, beginning in 1816\r\nwith a simple analysis of caustic lime for Sir Humphry Davy, Faraday\r\nhad become an active worker in the domain of original research.\r\nThe fascination of the quest of the unknown was already upon him.\r\nWhile working with and for Davy on the properties of flame and its\r\nnon-transmission through iron gauze, in the investigation of the\r\nsafety lamp, other problems of a kindred nature had arisen. One of\r\nthese, relating to the flow of gases through capillary tubes, Faraday\r\nhad attacked by himself in 1817. The subject formed one of the six\r\noriginal papers which he published that year. In the next two years\r\nhe contributed in all no fewer than thirty-seven papers or notes to\r\nthe _Quarterly Journal of Science_. In 1819 began a long research on\r\nsteel which lasted over the year 1820. He had already given evidence\r\nof that dislike of half-truths, that aversion for “doubtful knowledge”\r\nwhich marked him so strongly. He had exposed, with quiet but unsparing\r\nsuccess, the emptiness of the claim made by an Austrian chemist to have\r\ndiscovered a new metal, “Sirium,” by the simple device of analysing\r\nout from the mass all the constituents of known sorts, leaving\r\nbehind--nothing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HE FALLS IN LOVE.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, Faraday being twenty-nine years of age, a new and\r\nall-important episode in his life occurred. Amongst the members of the\r\nlittle congregation which met on Sundays at Paul’s Alley, Red Cross\r\nStreet, was a Mr. Barnard, a working silversmith of Paternoster Row,\r\nan elder in the Sandemanian body. He had two sons, Edward Barnard, a\r\nfriend of Faraday’s, and George, who became a well-known water-colour\r\nartist; and three daughters; one who was already at this time married;\r\nSarah, now twenty-one years of age; and Jane, who was still younger.\r\nEdward had seen in Faraday’s note-book those boyish tirades against\r\nfalling in love, and had told his sister Sarah of them. Nevertheless,\r\nin spite of all such misogynistic fancies, Faraday woke up one day to\r\nfind that the large-eyed, clear-browed girl had grown to a place in his\r\nheart that he had thought barred against the assaults of love. She\r\nasked him on one occasion to show her the rhymes against love in his\r\nnote-book. In reply he sent her the hitherto unpublished poem:--\r\n\r\n                                            R. I.\r\n                                        Oct. 11th, 1819.\r\n\r\n  You ask’d me last night for the lines which I penn’d,\r\n    When, exulting in ignorance, tempted by pride,\r\n  I dared torpid hearts and cold breasts to commend,\r\n    And affection’s kind pow’r and soft joys to deride.\r\n\r\n  If you urge it I cannot refuse your request:\r\n    Though to grant it will punish severely my crime:\r\n  But my fault I repent, and my errors detest;\r\n    And I hoped to have shown my conversion in time.\r\n\r\n  Remember, our laws in their mercy decide\r\n    That no culprit be forced to give proof of his deed:\r\n  They protect him though fall’n, his failings they hide,\r\n    And enable the wretch from his crimes to receed (_sic_).\r\n\r\n  The principle’s noble! I need not urge long\r\n    Its adoption; then turn from a judge to a friend.\r\n  Do not ask for the proof that I once acted wrong,\r\n    But direct me and guide me the way to amend.\r\n\r\n                                        M. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat other previous passages between them are hinted at in the letter\r\nwhich he sent her, is unknown; but on July 5, 1820, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n                                        Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n    You know me as well or better than I do myself. You know\r\n    my former prejudices, and my present thoughts--you know my\r\n    weaknesses, my vanity, my whole mind; you have converted me\r\n    from one erroneous way, let me hope you will attempt to correct\r\n    what others are wrong.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Again and again I attempt to say what I feel, but I cannot.\r\n    Let me, however, claim not to be the selfish being that wishes\r\n    to bend your affections for his own sake only. In whatever way\r\n    I can best minister to your happiness either by assiduity or by\r\n    absence, it shall be done. Do not injure me by withdrawing your\r\n    friendship, or punish me for aiming to be more than a friend by\r\n    making me less; and if you cannot grant me more, leave me what\r\n    I possess, but hear me.\r\n\r\nSarah Barnard showed the letter to her father. She was young, and\r\nfeared to accept her lover. All her father would say by way of counsel\r\nwas that love made philosophers say many foolish things. The intensity\r\nof Faraday’s passion proved for the time a bar to his advance. Fearing\r\nlest she should be unable to return it with equal force, Miss Barnard\r\nshrank from replying. To postpone an immediate decision, she went away\r\nwith her sister, Mrs. Reid, to Ramsgate. Faraday followed to press his\r\nsuit, and after several happy days in her company, varied with country\r\nwalks and a run over to Dover, he was able to say: “Not a moment’s\r\nalloy of this evening’s happiness occurred. Everything was delightful\r\nto the last moment of my stay with my companion, because she was so.”\r\n\r\nOf the many letters that Faraday wrote to his future wife a number have\r\nbeen preserved. They are manly, simple, full of quiet affection, but\r\nabsolutely free from gush or forced sentiment of any kind. Extracts\r\nfrom several of them are printed by Bence Jones. One of these, written\r\nearly in 1821, runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n    I tied up the enclosed key with my books last night, and make\r\n    haste to return it lest its absence should occasion confusion.\r\n    If it has, it will perhaps remind you of the disorder I must be\r\n    in here also for the want of a key--I mean the one to my heart.\r\n    However, I know where my key is, and hope soon to have it here,\r\n    and then the Institution will be all right again. Let no one\r\n    oppose my gaining possession of it when unavoidable obstacles\r\n    are removed.\r\n\r\n                    Ever, my dear girl, one who is perfectly yours,\r\n                                                           M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFaraday obtained leave of the managers to bring his wife to live in his\r\nrooms at the Institution; and in May, 1821, his position was changed\r\nfrom that of lecture assistant to that of superintendent of the house\r\nand laboratory. In these changes Sir Humphry Davy gave him willing\r\nassistance. But his salary remained £100 a year.\r\n\r\nObstacles being now removed, Faraday and Miss Barnard were married on\r\nJune 12. Few persons were asked to the wedding, for Faraday wished it\r\nto be “just like any other day.” “There will,” he wrote, “be no bustle,\r\nno noise, no hurry ... it is in the heart that we expect and look for\r\npleasure.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A HAPPY MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nHis marriage, though childless, was extremely happy. Mrs. Faraday\r\nproved to be exactly the true helpmeet for his need; and he loved her\r\nto the end of his life with a chivalrous devotion which has become\r\nalmost a proverb. Little indications of his attachment crop up in\r\nunexpected places in his subsequent career; but as with his religious\r\nviews so with his domestic affairs, he never obtruded them upon others,\r\nnor yet shrank from mentioning them when there was cause. Tyndall,\r\nin after years, made the intensity of Faraday’s attachment to his\r\nwife the subject of a striking simile: “Never, I believe, existed a\r\nmanlier, purer, steadier love. Like a burning diamond, it continued to\r\nshed, for six and forty years, its white and smokeless glow.”\r\n\r\nIn his diploma-book, now in possession of the Royal Society, in which\r\nhe carefully preserved all the certificates, awards, and honours\r\nbestowed upon him by academies and universities, there may be found on\r\na slip inserted in the volume this entry:--\r\n\r\n                                        25th January, 1847.\r\n\r\n    Amongst these records and events, I here insert the date of one\r\n    which, as a source of honour and happiness, far exceeds the\r\n    rest. We were _married_ on June 12, 1821.\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd two years later, in the autobiographical notes he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    On June 12, 1821, he married--an event which more than any\r\n    other contributed to his earthly happiness and healthful state\r\n    of mind. The union has continued for twenty-eight years, and\r\n    has nowise changed, except in the depth and strength of its\r\n    character.\r\n\r\nWhen near the close of his life, he presented to the Royal Institution\r\nthe bookcase with the volumes of notes of Davy’s lectures and of books\r\nbound by himself, the inscription recorded that they were the gift of\r\n“Michael _and_ Sarah Faraday.”\r\n\r\nEvery Saturday evening he used to take his wife to her father’s\r\nhouse at Paternoster Row, so that on Sunday they should be nearer to\r\nthe chapel at Paul’s Alley. And in after years, when he was away on\r\nscientific work, visiting lighthouses, or attending meetings of the\r\nBritish Association, he always tried to return for the Sunday.\r\n\r\nA letter from Liebig in 1844 (see p. 225) gives one of the very few\r\nglimpses of contemporary date of the impression made by Mrs. Faraday\r\nupon others.\r\n\r\nOne month after his marriage Faraday made his profession of faith\r\nbefore the Sandemanian church, to which his wife already belonged, and\r\nwas admitted a member. To his religious views, and his relations to the\r\nbody he thus formally joined, reference will be found later.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST ELECTRICAL DISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\nFaraday now settled down to a routine life of scientific work. His\r\nprofessional reputation was rising, and his services as analyst\r\nwere being sought after. But in the midst of this he was pursuing\r\ninvestigations on his own account. In the late summer of this year\r\nhe made the discovery of the electro-magnetic rotations described in\r\nChapter III.--his first important piece of original research--and\r\nhad in consequence a serious misunderstanding with Dr. Wollaston. On\r\nSeptember 3rd, working with George Barnard in the laboratory, he saw\r\nthe electric wire for the first time revolve around the pole of the\r\nmagnet. Rubbing his hands as he danced around the table with beaming\r\nface, he exclaimed: “There they go! there they go! we have succeeded\r\nat last.” Then he gleefully proposed that they should wind up the day\r\nby going to one of the theatres. Which should it be? “Oh, to Astley’s,\r\nto see the horses.” And to Astley’s they went. On Christmas Day he\r\ncalled his young wife to see something new: an electric conducting-wire\r\nrevolving under the influence of the magnetism of the earth alone.\r\nHe also read two chemical papers at the Royal Society, announcing new\r\ndiscoveries; one of them in conjunction with his friend Phillips. In\r\nJuly, 1822, he took his wife and her mother to Ramsgate, whilst he went\r\noff with Phillips to Swansea to try a new process in Vivian’s copper\r\nworks. During this enforced parting, Faraday wrote his wife three\r\nletters from which the following are extracts:---\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “A MERE LOVE-LETTER.”]\r\n\r\n                                        (July 21, 1822).\r\n\r\n    I perceive that if I give way to my thoughts, I shall write you\r\n    a mere love-letter, just as usual, with not a particle of news\r\n    in it: to prevent which I will constrain myself to a narrative\r\n    of what has happened since I left you up to the present time,\r\n    and then indulge my affection.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday was a day of events--little, but pleasant. I went in\r\n    the morning to the Institution, and in the course of the day\r\n    analysed the water, and sent an account of it to Mr. Hatchett.\r\n    Mr. Fisher I did not see. Mr. Lawrence called in, and behaved\r\n    with his usual generosity. He had called in the early part of\r\n    the week, and, finding that I should be at the Institution on\r\n    Saturday only, came up, as I have already said, and insisted\r\n    on my accepting two ten-pound bank-notes for the information\r\n    he professed to have obtained from me at various times. Is not\r\n    this handsome? The money, as you know, could not have been at\r\n    any time more acceptable; and I cannot see any reason, my dear\r\n    love, why you and I should not regard it as another proof,\r\n    among many, that our trust should without a moment’s reserve be\r\n    freely reposed on Him who provideth all things for His people.\r\n    Have we not many times been reproached, by such mercies as\r\n    these, for our caring after food and raiment and the things\r\n    of this world? On coming home in the evening, _i.e._, coming\r\n    to Paternoster Row home, I learned that Mr. Phillips had seen\r\n    C., and had told her we should not leave London until Monday\r\n    evening. So I shall have to-morrow to get things ready in,\r\n    and I shall have enough to do. I fancy we are going to a large\r\n    mansion and into high company, so I must take more clothes.\r\n    Having the £20, I am become bold....\r\n\r\n    And now, how do my dear wife and mother do? Are you\r\n    comfortable? are you happy? are the lodgings convenient, and\r\n    Mrs. O. obliging? Has the place done you good? Is the weather\r\n    fine? Tell me all things as soon as you can. I think if you\r\n    write directly you get this it will be best, but let it be a\r\n    long letter. I do not know when I wished so much for a long\r\n    letter as I do from you now. You will get this on Tuesday, and\r\n    any letter from you to me cannot reach Swansea before Thursday\r\n    or Friday--a sad long time to wait. Direct to me, Post Office,\r\n    Swansea; or perhaps better, to me at -- Vivian Esq., Marino,\r\n    near Swansea, South Wales....\r\n\r\n    And now, my dear girl, I must set business aside. I am tired\r\n    of the dull detail of things, and want to talk of love to you;\r\n    and surely there can be no circumstances under which I can have\r\n    more right. The theme was a cheerful and delightful one before\r\n    we were married, but it is doubly so now. I now can speak, not\r\n    of my own heart only, but of both our hearts. I now speak, not\r\n    with any doubt of the state of your thoughts, but with the\r\n    fullest conviction that they answer to my own. All that I can\r\n    now say warm and animated to you, I know that you would say to\r\n    me again. The excess of pleasure which I feel in knowing you\r\n    mine is doubled by the consciousness that you feel equal joy in\r\n    knowing me yours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FROM HUSBAND TO WIFE.]\r\n\r\n                                        Marino: Sunday, July 28, 1822.\r\n\r\n    MY DEARLY BELOVED WIFE,--I have just read your letter again,\r\n    preparatory to my writing to you, that my thoughts might be\r\n    still more elevated and quickened than before. I could almost\r\n    rejoice at my absence from you, if it were only that it has\r\n    produced such an earnest and warm mark of affection from you\r\n    as that letter. Tears of joy and delight fell from my eyes on\r\n    its perusal. I think it was last Sunday evening, about this\r\n    time, that I wrote to you from London; and I again resort to\r\n    this affectionate conversation with you, to tell you what has\r\n    happened since the letter which I got franked from this place\r\n    to you on Thursday I believe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    We have been working very hard here at the copper works, and\r\n    with some success. Our days have gone on just as before. A walk\r\n    before breakfast; then breakfast; then to the works till four\r\n    or five o’clock, and then home to dress, and dinner. After\r\n    dinner, tea and conversation. I have felt doubly at a loss\r\n    to-day, being absent from both the meeting and you. When away\r\n    from London before, I have had you with me, and we could read\r\n    and talk and walk; to-day I have had no one to fill your place,\r\n    so I will tell you how I have done. There are so many here, and\r\n    their dinner so late and long, that I made up my mind to avoid\r\n    it, though, if possible, without appearing singular. So, having\r\n    remained in my room till breakfast time, we all breakfasted\r\n    together, and soon after Mr. Phillips and myself took a walk\r\n    out to the Mumbles Point, at the extremity of this side of\r\n    the bay. There we sat down to admire the beautiful scenery\r\n    around us, and, after we had viewed it long enough, returned\r\n    slowly home. We stopped at a little village in our way, called\r\n    Oystermouth, and dined at a small, neat, homely house about\r\n    one o’clock. We then came back to Marino, and after a little\r\n    while again went out--Mr. Phillips to a relation in the town,\r\n    and myself for a walk on the sands and the edge of the bay. I\r\n    took tea in a little cottage, and, returning home about seven\r\n    o’clock, found them engaged at dinner, so came up to my own\r\n    room, and shall not see them again to-night. I went down for a\r\n    light just now, and heard them playing some sacred music in the\r\n    drawing-room; they have all been to church to-day, and are what\r\n    are called regular people.\r\n\r\n    The trial at Hereford is put off for the present, but yet we\r\n    shall not be able to be in town before the end of this week.\r\n    Though I long to see you, I do not know when it will be;\r\n    but this I know, that I am getting daily more anxious about\r\n    you. Mr. Phillips wrote home to Mrs. Phillips from here even\r\n    before I did--_i.e._ last Wednesday. This morning he received\r\n    a letter from Mrs. Phillips (who is very well) desiring him\r\n    to ask me for a copy of one of my letters to you, that he may\r\n    learn to write love-letters of sufficient length. He laughs at\r\n    the scolding, and says that it does not hurt at a distance....\r\n\r\n    It seems to me so long since I left you that there must have\r\n    been time for a great many things to have happened. I expect to\r\n    see you with such joy when I come home that I shall hardly know\r\n    what to do with myself. I hope you will be well and blooming,\r\n    and animated and happy, when you see me. I do not know how we\r\n    shall contrive to get away from here. We certainly shall not\r\n    have concluded before Thursday evening, but I think we shall\r\n    endeavour earnestly to leave this place on Friday night, in\r\n    which case we shall get home late on Saturday night. If we\r\n    cannot do that, as I should not like to be travelling all day\r\n    on Sunday, we shall probably not leave until Sunday night; but\r\n    I think the first plan will be adopted, and that you will not\r\n    have time to answer this letter. I expect, nevertheless, an\r\n    answer to my last letter--_i.e._ I expect that my dear wife\r\n    will think of me again. Expect here means nothing more than\r\n    I trust and have a full confidence that it will be so. My\r\n    kind girl is so affectionate that she would not think a dozen\r\n    letters too much for me if there were time to send them, which\r\n    I am glad there is not.\r\n\r\n    Give my love to our mothers as earnestly as you would your own,\r\n    and also to Charlotte or John, or any such one that you may\r\n    have with you. I have not written to Paternoster Row yet, but\r\n    I am going to write now, so that I may be permitted to finish\r\n    this letter here. I do not feel quite sure, indeed, that the\r\n    permission to leave off is not as necessary from my own heart\r\n    as from yours.\r\n\r\n    With the utmost affection--with perhaps too much--I am, my dear\r\n    wife, my Sarah, your devoted husband,\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFaraday’s next scientific success was the liquefaction of chlorine\r\n(see Chapter III., p. 93). This discovery, which created much interest\r\nin the scientific world, was the occasion of a serious trouble with\r\nSir Humphry Davy; for doubtless Davy was annoyed that he had left such\r\na simple experiment to a mere assistant. Writing on the matter years\r\nafter, Faraday said:--\r\n\r\n    When my paper was written, it was, according to a custom\r\n    consequent upon our relative positions, submitted to Sir\r\n    H. Davy (as were all my papers for the “Philosophical\r\n    Transactions” up to a much later period), and he altered it as\r\n    he thought fit. This practice was one of great kindness to me,\r\n    for various grammatical mistakes and awkward expressions were\r\n    from time to time thus removed, which might else have remained.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, Davy on this occasion added a note (which was duly\r\nprinted) saying precisely how far he had any share in suggesting the\r\nexperiment, but in no wise traversing any of Faraday’s claims. Although\r\nhe thus acted generously to the latter, there can be no question\r\nthat he began to be seriously jealous of Faraday’s rising fame. The\r\nmatter was the more serious because some who did not have a nice\r\nappreciation of the circumstances chose to rake up a charge which had\r\nbeen raised two years before against Faraday by some of Dr. Wollaston’s\r\nfriends--in particular by Dr. Warburton--about the discovery of the\r\nelectro-magnetic rotations, a charge which Faraday’s straightforward\r\naction and Wollaston’s frank satisfaction ought to have dissipated\r\nfor ever. And all this was doubly aggravating because Faraday was now\r\nexpecting to be proposed as a candidate for the Fellowship of the Royal\r\nSociety, of which Sir Humphry was President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROPOSED FOR THE FELLOWSHIP.]\r\n\r\nAt that time, as now, the proposal paper or “certificate” of a\r\ncandidate for election must be presented, signed by a number of\r\ninfluential Fellows. Faraday’s friend Phillips took in hand the\r\npleasant task of drawing up this certificate and of collecting\r\nthe necessary signatures. The rule then was that the certificate\r\nso presented must be read out at ten successive meetings of the\r\nSociety; after which a ballot took place. Faraday’s certificate bears\r\ntwenty-nine names. The very first is that of Wollaston, and it is\r\nfollowed by those of Children, Babington, Sir John Herschel, Babbage,\r\nPhillips, Roget, and Sir James South.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of May, 1823, Faraday wrote to Phillips:--\r\n\r\n    A thousand thanks to you for your kindness--I am delighted with\r\n    the names--Mr. Brande had told me of it before I got your note\r\n    and thought it impossible to be better. I suppose you will not\r\n    be in Grosvenor Street this Evening, so I will put this in the\r\n    post.\r\n\r\n    Our Best remembrances to Mrs. Phillips.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours Ever,\r\n                                              M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe certificate was read for the first time on May 1st. The absence\r\nof the names of Davy and Brande is accounted for by the one being\r\nPresident and the other Secretary. Bence Jones gives the following\r\naccount of what followed:--\r\n\r\n    That Sir H. Davy actively opposed Faraday’s election is no less\r\n    certain than it is sad.\r\n\r\n    Many years ago, Faraday gave a friend the following facts,\r\n    which were written down immediately:--“Sir H. Davy told me I\r\n    must take down my certificate. I replied that I had not put\r\n    it up; that I could not take it down, as it was put up by my\r\n    proposers. He then said I must get my proposers to take it\r\n    down. I answered that I knew they would not do so. Then he\r\n    said, I as President will take it down. I replied that I was\r\n    sure Sir H. Davy would do what he thought was for the good of\r\n    the Royal Society.”\r\n\r\n    Faraday also said that one of his proposers told him that Sir\r\n    H. Davy had walked for an hour round the courtyard of Somerset\r\n    House, arguing that Faraday ought not to be elected. This was\r\n    probably about May 30.\r\n\r\nFaraday also made the following notes on the circumstance of the charge\r\nmade by Wollaston’s friends:--\r\n\r\n    1823. _In relation to Davy’s opposition to my election at the\r\n    Royal Society._\r\n\r\n    Sir H. Davy angry, May 30.\r\n\r\n    Phillips’ report through Mr. Children, June 5.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Warburton called first time, June 5 (evening).\r\n\r\n    I called on Dr. Wollaston, and he not in town, June 9.\r\n\r\n    I called on Dr. Wollaston, and saw him, June 14.\r\n\r\n    I called at Sir H. Davy’s, and he called on me, June 17.\r\n\r\nOn July 8 Dr. Warburton wrote that he was satisfied with Faraday’s\r\nexplanation, and added that he would tell his friends that “my\r\nobjections to you as a Fellow are and ought to be withdrawn, and that I\r\nnow wish to forward your election.”\r\n\r\nBence Jones adds:--\r\n\r\n    On June 29, Sir H. Davy ends a note, “I am, dear Faraday, very\r\n    sincerely your well wisher and friend.” So that outwardly the\r\n    storm rapidly passed away; and when the ballot was taken, after\r\n    the certificate had been read at ten meetings, there was only\r\n    one black ball.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FELLOWSHIP AND MAGNANIMITY.]\r\n\r\nThe election took place January 8, 1824.\r\n\r\nOf this unfortunate misunderstanding,[11] Davy’s biographer, Dr.\r\nThorpe, writes:--\r\n\r\n    The jealousy thus manifested by Davy is one of the most pitiful\r\n    facts in his history. It was a sign of that moral weakness\r\n    which was at the bottom of much of his unpopularity, and which\r\n    revealed itself in various ways as his physical strength\r\n    decayed....\r\n\r\nFaraday allowed himself in after days no shade of resentment against\r\nDavy; though he confessed rather sadly that after his election as\r\nF.R.S. his relations with his former master were never the same as\r\nbefore. If anyone recurred to the old scandal, he would fire with\r\nindignation. Dumas in his “Éloge Historique” has given the following\r\nanecdote:--\r\n\r\n    Faraday never forgot what he owed to Davy. Visiting him at the\r\n    family lunch, twenty years after the death of the latter, he\r\n    noticed evidently that I responded with some coolness to the\r\n    praises which the recollection of Davy’s great discoveries had\r\n    evoked from him. He made no comment. But, after the meal, he\r\n    simply took me down to the library of the Royal Institution,\r\n    and stopping before the portrait of Davy he said: “He was a\r\n    great man, wasn’t he?” Then, turning round, he added, “It was\r\n    here[12] that he spoke to me for the first time.” I bowed. We\r\n    went down to the laboratory. Faraday took out a note-book,\r\n    opened it and pointed out with his finger the words written\r\n    by Davy, at the very moment when by means of the battery he\r\n    had just decomposed potash, and had seen the first globule of\r\n    potassium ever isolated by the hand of man. Davy had traced\r\n    with a feverish hand a circle which separates them from the\r\n    rest of the page: the words, “Capital Experiment,” which\r\n    he wrote below, cannot be read without emotion by any true\r\n    chemist. I confessed myself conquered, and this time, without\r\n    hesitating longer, I joined in the admiration of my good friend.\r\n\r\nDr. Thorpe in his life of Davy adds:--\r\n\r\n    ... To the end of his days he [Faraday] regarded Davy as his\r\n    true master, preserving to the last, in spite of his knowledge\r\n    of the moral frailties of Davy’s nature, the respect and even\r\n    reverence which is to be seen in his early lecture notes and in\r\n    his letters to his friend Abbott.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 the Athenæum Club was started by J. Wilson Croker, Sir H. Davy,\r\nSir T. Lawrence, Sir F. Chantrey, and others, as a resort for literary\r\nand scientific men. Faraday was made Club Secretary; but he found the\r\nduties totally uncongenial, and in 1824 resigned the post to his friend\r\nMagrath.\r\n\r\nFaraday was advanced in 1825 to the position of Director of the\r\nLaboratory of the Royal Institution, Brande remaining Professor of\r\nChemistry. One of the first acts of the new Director was to hold\r\nevening meetings of the members in the laboratory, when experiments\r\nwere shown and some demonstration was given. There were three or four\r\nof these informal gatherings that year. In the next year these Friday\r\nevening meetings were held more systematically. There were seventeen\r\nduring the season, at six of which Faraday gave discourses (see p.\r\n100). In 1827 there were nineteen, of which he delivered three. By this\r\ntime the gatherings were held in the theatre as at present, save that\r\nladies were only admitted at that date, and for many years, to the\r\nupper gallery. He also originated the Christmas lectures to juveniles,\r\nwhile continuing to give regular courses of morning lectures, as his\r\npredecessors Young and Davy had done. His activity for the Royal\r\nInstitution was incessant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FEES FOR PROFESSIONAL WORK.]\r\n\r\nDown to the year 1830 Faraday continued to undertake, at professional\r\nfees, chemical analyses and expert work in the law-courts, and thereby\r\nadded considerably to the very slender emolument of his position;\r\nbut, finding this work to make increasing demands on his time, which\r\nhe could ill spare from the absorbing pursuit of original researches,\r\nhe decided to abandon a practice which would have made him rich, and\r\nwithdrew from expert practice. The following letter to Phillips was\r\nwritten only a few weeks before this determination:--\r\n\r\n    [_M. Faraday to Richard Phillips._]\r\n\r\n                                        Royal Institution,\r\n                                              June 21, 1831.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR PHILLIPS,--I have been trying hard to get time enough\r\n    to write to you by post to-night, but without success; the\r\n    bell has rung, and I am too late. However, I am resolved to\r\n    be ready to-morrow. We have been very anxious and rather\r\n    embarrassed in our minds about your anxiety to know how things\r\n    were proceeding, and uncertain whether reference to them\r\n    would be pleasant, and that has been the cause why I have\r\n    not written to you, for I did not know what character your\r\n    connexion with Badams had. I was a little the more embarrassed\r\n    because of my acquaintance with Mr. Rickard and his family,\r\n    and, of course with his brother-in-law, Dr. Urchell, of whom I\r\n    have made numerous enquiries to know what Mr. Rickard intended\r\n    doing at Birmingham. He (expressed a) hope it would be nothing\r\n    unpleasant to you, but was not sure. Our only bit of comfort in\r\n    the matter was on hearing from Daniell about you a little; he\r\n    was here to-day, and glad to hear of you through me. But now\r\n    that I may write, let me say that Mrs. Faraday has been very\r\n    anxious with myself, and begs me earnestly to remember her to\r\n    Mrs. Phillips. We have often wished we could have had you here\r\n    for an hour or two, to break off what we supposed might be the\r\n    train of thoughts at home.\r\n\r\n    With regard to the five guineas, do not think of it for a\r\n    moment. Whilst I supposed a mercantile concern wanted my\r\n    opinion for its own interested uses, I saw no reason why it\r\n    should not pay me; but it is altogether another matter when it\r\n    becomes _your affair_. I do not think you would have wished\r\n    _me_ to pay _you_ five guineas for anything you might have done\r\n    personally for me. “Dog don’t eat dog,” as Sir E. Home said to\r\n    me in a similar case. The affair is settled.\r\n\r\n    I have no doubt I shall be amused and, as you speak of new\r\n    facts, instructed by your letter to Dr. Reid, as I am by all\r\n    your letters. Daniell says he thinks you are breaking a fly\r\n    upon the wheel. You know I consider you as the Prince of\r\n    Chemical critics.\r\n\r\n    Pearsall has been working, as you know, on red manganese\r\n    solutions. He has not proved, but he makes out a strong\r\n    case for the opinion, that they owe their colour and other\r\n    properties to manganesic acid. This paper will be in the next\r\n    number of the Journal.\r\n\r\n    With regard to the gramme, wine-pint, etc., etc., in the\r\n    manipulation I had great trouble about them, for I could find\r\n    no agreement, and at last resolved to take certain conclusions\r\n    from Capt. Kater’s paper and the Act of Parliament, and\r\n    calculate the rest. I think I took the data at page 67,\r\n    paragraph 119, as the data, but am not sure, and cannot go over\r\n    them again.\r\n\r\n    My memory gets worse and worse daily. I will not, therefore,\r\n    say I have not received your Pharmacopœia--that of 1824 is what\r\n    I have at hand and use. I am not aware of any other. I have\r\n    sent a paper to the R. S., but not chemical. It is on sound,\r\n    etc., etc. If they print it, of course you will have a copy in\r\n    due time.\r\n\r\n                    I am, my dear Phillips,\r\n                            Most faithfully and sincerely yours,\r\n                                                  M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n    Is it right to ask what has become of Badams? I suppose he is,\r\n    of course, a defaulter at the R. S.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SACRIFICES FOR SCIENCE.]\r\n\r\nThis sacrifice for science was not small. He had made £1,000 in 1830\r\nout of these professional occupations, and in 1831 would have made\r\nmore but for his own decision. In 1832 some Excise work that he had\r\nretained brought him in £155 9s.; but in no subsequent year did it\r\nbring in so much. He might easily have made £5,000 a year had he\r\nchosen to cultivate the professional connection thus formed; and as he\r\ncontinued, with little intermission, in activity till 1860, he might\r\nhave died a wealthy man. But he chose otherwise; and his first reward\r\ncame in the autumn of 1831, in the great discovery of magneto-electric\r\ncurrents--the principle upon which all our modern dynamos and\r\ntransformers are based, the foundation of all the electric lighting and\r\nelectric transmission of power. From this work he went on to a research\r\non the identity of all the kinds of electricity, until then supposed\r\nto be of separate sorts, and from this to electro-chemical work of the\r\nvery highest value. Of all these investigations some account will be\r\nfound in the chapters which follow.\r\n\r\nBut the immense body of patient scientific work thus done for the love\r\nof science was not accomplished without sacrifices of a more than\r\npecuniary kind. He withdrew more and more from society, declined to\r\ndine in company, ceased to give dinners, withdrew from all social and\r\nphilanthropic organisations; even withdrew from taking any part in the\r\nmanagement of any of the learned societies. The British Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Science was started in 1831. Faraday took no part\r\nin that movement, and did not attend the inaugural meeting at York.\r\nThe next year, however, he attended the second meeting of that body at\r\nOxford. Here he “had the pleasure”--it is his own phrase--of making\r\nan experiment on the great magnet in the University museum, drawing a\r\nspark by induction in a coil of wire. This was a coil 220 feet long,\r\nwound on a hollow cylinder of pasteboard, which had been used in the\r\nclassical experiments of the preceding year. He also showed that the\r\ninduced currents could heat a thin wire connected to the terminals\r\nof this coil. These experiments, which were made in conjunction with\r\nMr. (afterwards Sir William Snow) Harris, Professor Daniell, and\r\nMr. Duncan, seem to have excited great attention at the time. The\r\ntheologians of Oxford appear to have been mightily distressed both by\r\nthe success of the spark experiment and by the welcome shown by the\r\nUniversity to the representatives of science. The following passage\r\nfrom Pusey’s life[13] reveals the rampant clericalism which then and\r\nfor a score of years sought to put back the clock of civilisation.\r\n\r\n    During the Long Vacation of 1832 Pusey had plenty of work on\r\n    hand. The British Association had held its first meeting in\r\n    Oxford during the month of June, and on the 21st the honorary\r\n    degree of D.C.L. was bestowed on four of its distinguished\r\n    members: Brewster, Faraday, Brown, and Dalton. Keble, who was\r\n    now Professor of Poetry, was angry at the “temper and tone of\r\n    the Oxford doctors”; they had “truckled sadly to the spirit of\r\n    the times” in receiving “the hodge-podge of philosophers” as\r\n    they did. Dr. L. Carpenter had assured Dr. Macbride that “the\r\n    University had prolonged her existence for a hundred years by\r\n    the kind reception he and his fellows had received.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE HODGE-PODGE OF PHILOSOPHERS.]\r\n\r\nIt is not without significance, perhaps, that all the four men thus\r\ncontemptuously labelled by Keble as the “hodge-podge of philosophers”\r\nwere Dissenters. Brewster and Brown (the great botanist and discoverer\r\nof the “Brownian” motion of particles) belonged to the Presbyterian\r\nChurch of Scotland, Dalton was a Member of the Society of Friends, and\r\nFaraday a Sandemanian. Newman appears to have been equally discomposed\r\nby the circumstance, for he got his friend Mr. Rose to write an\r\narticle--a long and weary diatribe--against the British Association,\r\nwhich he inserted in the _British Critic_ for 1839. Its slanders,\r\nassumptions, suppressions, and suggestions are in a very unworthy\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nFaraday’s devotion to the Royal Institution and its operations was\r\nmarvellous. He had already abandoned outside professional work. From\r\n1838 he refused to see any callers except three times a week. His\r\nextreme desire was to give himself uninterruptedly to research. His\r\nfriend A. de la Rive says:--\r\n\r\n    Every morning Faraday went into his laboratory as the man of\r\n    business goes to his office, and then tried by experiment the\r\n    truth of the ideas which he had conceived overnight, as ready\r\n    to give them up if experiment said _no_ as to follow out the\r\n    consequences with rigorous logic if experiment answered _yes_.\r\n\r\nHe had in 1827 declined the appointment of Professor of Chemistry in\r\nthe University (afterwards called University College) of London, giving\r\nas his reason the interests of the Royal Institution. He wrote:--\r\n\r\n    I think it a matter of duty and gratitude on my part to do\r\n    what I can for the good of the Royal Institution in the\r\n    present attempt to establish it firmly. The Institution has\r\n    been a source of knowledge and pleasure to me for the last\r\n    fourteen years; and though it does not pay me in salary what\r\n    I _now_ strive to do for it, yet I possess the kind feelings\r\n    and goodwill of its authorities and members, and all the\r\n    privileges it can grant or I require; and, moreover, I remember\r\n    the protection it has afforded me during the past years of\r\n    my scientific life. These circumstances, with the thorough\r\n    conviction that it is a useful and valuable establishment, and\r\n    the strong hopes that exertions will be followed with success,\r\n    have decided me in giving at least two years more to it, in the\r\n    belief that after that time it will proceed well, into whatever\r\n    hands it may pass.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, however, he was asked to become lecturer on chemistry at the\r\nRoyal Academy at Woolwich. As this involved only twenty lectures a year\r\nhe agreed, the salary being fixed at £200 a year. These lectures were\r\ncontinued until 1849.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRINITY HOUSE APPOINTMENT.]\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the whole course of his scientific work was changed by his\r\nappointment as scientific adviser to Trinity House, the body which has\r\nofficial charge of the lighthouse service in Great Britain. To the\r\nDeputy-master he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    I consider your letter to me as a great compliment, and should\r\n    view the appointment at the Trinity House, which you propose,\r\n    in the same light; but I may not accept even honours without\r\n    due consideration.\r\n\r\n    In the first place, my time is of great value to me; and if\r\n    the appointment you speak of involved anything like periodical\r\n    routine attendances, I do not think I could accept it. But\r\n    if it meant that in consultation, in the examination of\r\n    proposed plans and experiments, in trials, etc., made as\r\n    my convenience would allow, and with an honest sense of a\r\n    duty to be performed, then I think it would consist with my\r\n    present engagements. You have left the title and the sum in\r\n    pencil. These I look at mainly as regards the character of the\r\n    appointment; you will believe me to be sincere in this when you\r\n    remember my indifference to your proposition as a matter of\r\n    interest, though _not as a matter of kindness_.\r\n\r\n    In consequence of the goodwill and confidence of all around me,\r\n    I can at any moment convert my time into money, but I do not\r\n    require more of the latter than is sufficient for necessary\r\n    purposes. The sum, therefore, of £200 is quite enough in\r\n    itself, but not if it is to be the indicator of the character\r\n    of the appointment; but I think you do not view it so, and\r\n    that you and I understand each other in that respect; and\r\n    your letter confirms me in that opinion. The position which I\r\n    presume you would wish me to hold is analogous to that of a\r\n    standing counsel.\r\n\r\n    As to the title, it might be what you pleased almost. Chemical\r\n    adviser is too narrow, for you would find me venturing into\r\n    parts of the philosophy of light not chemical. Scientific\r\n    adviser you may think too broad (or in me too presumptuous);\r\n    and so it would be, if by it was understood all science.\r\n\r\nHe held the post of scientific adviser for nearly thirty years. The\r\nrecords of his work are to be found in nineteen large portfolios full\r\nof manuscripts, all indexed with that minute and scrupulous attention\r\nto order and method which characterised all his work.\r\n\r\nHe also held nominally the post of scientific adviser to the Admiralty,\r\nat a salary of £200 a year. But this salary he never drew. Once the\r\nofficials of the Admiralty requested his opinion upon a printed\r\nadvertising pamphlet of somebody’s patent disinfecting powder and\r\nanti-miasma lamp. Faraday returned it, with a quietly indignant protest\r\nthat it was not such a document as he could be expected to give an\r\nopinion upon.\r\n\r\nFaraday’s hope, expressed in 1827, that in two years the Royal\r\nInstitution might be restored to a financially sound position, was\r\nnot realised. He worked with the most scrupulous economy, noting down\r\nevery detail of expenditure even in farthings. “We were living on\r\nthe parings of our own skin,” he once told the managers. In 1832 the\r\nfinancial question became acute. At the end of that year a committee of\r\ninvestigation reported as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The Committee are certainly of opinion that no reduction can be\r\n    made in Mr. Faraday’s salary--£100 per annum, house, coals, and\r\n    candles; and beg to express their regret that the circumstances\r\n    of the Institution are not such as to justify their proposing\r\n    such an increase of it as the variety of duties which Mr.\r\n    Faraday has to perform, and the zeal and ability with which he\r\n    performs them, appear to merit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A HUNDRED A YEAR, AND TWO ROOMS.]\r\n\r\nA hundred a year, the use of two rooms, and coals! Such was the stipend\r\nof the man who had just before been made D.C.L. of Oxford, and had\r\nreceived from the Royal Society the highest award it can bestow--the\r\nCopley Medal! True, he made £200 by the Woolwich lectures; but he had a\r\nwife to maintain, his aged mother was entirely dependent upon him, and\r\nthere were many calls upon his private exercise of charity.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1835 it was the intention of Sir Robert Peel to\r\nconfer upon him a pension from the Civil List, but he went out of\r\noffice before this could be arranged, and Lord Melbourne became\r\nPrime Minister. Sir James South had in March written to Lord Ashley,\r\nafterwards the well-known Earl of Shaftesbury, asking him to place a\r\nlittle historiette of Faraday in Sir Robert Peel’s hands. The said\r\nhistoriette[14] contained an account of Faraday’s early career and\r\na description of the electrical machine which he had constructed as\r\na lad. “Now that his pecuniary circumstances,” it went on, “were\r\nimproved, he sent his younger sister to boarding-school, but to enable\r\nhim to defray the expense, to deprive himself of dinner every other day\r\nwas absolutely indispensable.” Peel expressed to Ashley lively regret\r\nat not having received the historiette earlier when he was still in\r\noffice. To Ashley, later, he wrote the following hitherto unpublished\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n                                        Drayton Manor,\r\n                                            May 3, 1835.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR ASHLEY,--You do me but justice in entertaining the\r\n    belief that had I remained in office one of my earliest\r\n    recommendations to his Majesty would have been to grant a\r\n    pension to Mr. Faraday, on the same principles precisely upon\r\n    which one was granted to Mr. Airy. If there had been the means,\r\n    I would have made the offer before I left office.\r\n\r\n    I was quite aware of Mr. Faraday’s high eminence as a man of\r\n    science, and the valuable practical service he has rendered\r\n    to the public in that capacity; but I was to blame in not\r\n    having ascertained whether his pecuniary circumstances made an\r\n    addition to his income an object to him.\r\n\r\n    I am sure no man living has a better claim to such a\r\n    consideration from the State than he has, and I trust the\r\n    principle I acted on with regard to the award of civil\r\n    pensions will not only remove away impediments of delicacy\r\n    and independent feeling from the acceptance of them, but will\r\n    add a higher value to the grant of a pension as an honourable\r\n    distinction than any that it could derive from its pecuniary\r\n    amount.\r\n\r\n                                        Ever, my dear Ashley,\r\n                                            Most faithfully yours,\r\n                                                          ROBERT PEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LORD MELBOURNE’S PARTICIPLE.]\r\n\r\nSir James South still endeavoured to bring about the grant thus\r\ndeferred, and wrote to the Hon. Caroline Fox, asking her to put the\r\nhistoriette of Faraday in the hands of Lord Holland, for him to lay\r\nbefore Melbourne. Faraday at first demurred to Sir James South’s\r\naction, but on the advice of his father-in-law, Barnard, withdrew his\r\ndemurrer. Later in the year he was asked to wait on Lord Melbourne at\r\nthe Treasury. He has left a diary of the events of the day, October\r\n26th. According to these notes it appears that Faraday first had\r\na long talk with Melbourne’s secretary, Mr. Young, about his first\r\ndemurring on religious grounds to accept the pension, about his\r\nobjection to savings’ banks, and the laying-up of wealth. Later in\r\nthe day he had a short interview with the First Lord of the Treasury,\r\nwhen Lord Melbourne, utterly mistaking the nature of the man before\r\nhim, inveighed roundly upon the whole system of giving pensions to\r\nscientific and literary persons, which he described as a piece of\r\nhumbug. He prefixed the word “humbug” with a participle which Faraday’s\r\nnotes describe as “theological.” Faraday, with an instant flash of\r\nindignation, bowed and withdrew. The same evening he left his card and\r\nthe following note at the Treasury:--\r\n\r\n    _To the Right Hon. Lord Viscount Melbourne, First Lord of the\r\n    Treasury._\r\n\r\n                                        October 26.\r\n\r\n    MY LORD,--The conversation with which your Lordship honoured\r\n    me this afternoon, including, as it did, your Lordship’s\r\n    opinion of the general character of the pensions given of late\r\n    to scientific persons, induces me respectfully to decline the\r\n    favour which I believe your Lordship intends for me; for I\r\n    feel that I could not, with satisfaction to myself, accept at\r\n    your Lordship’s hands that which, though it has the form of\r\n    approbation, is of the character which your Lordship so pithily\r\n    applied to it.\r\n\r\nFaraday’s diary says:--\r\n\r\n    Did not like it much, and, on the whole, regret that friends\r\n    should have placed me in the situation in which I found myself.\r\n    Lord Melbourne said that “he thought there had been a great\r\n    deal of humbug in the whole affair. He did not mean my affair,\r\n    of course, but that of the pensions altogether.”... I begged\r\n    him to understand that I had known nothing of the matter until\r\n    far advanced, and, though grateful to those friends who had\r\n    urged it forward, wished him to feel at perfect liberty in the\r\n    affair as far as I was concerned.... In the evening I wrote and\r\n    left a letter. I left it myself at ten o’clock at night, being\r\n    anxious that Lord Melbourne should have it before anything\r\n    further was done in the affair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MICHAEL’S PENSION.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the matter did not end here. Faraday’s friends were indignant.\r\nA caustic, and probably exaggerated, account--for which Faraday\r\ndisclaimed all responsibility--of the interview appeared in _Fraser’s\r\nMagazine_, and was copied into _The Times_ of November 28th, with the\r\nresult that, had it not been for the personal intervention of the King,\r\nthe pension might have been refused. The storm, however, passed away,\r\nand the pension of £300 per annum was granted on December 24th. Years\r\nafterwards, writing to Mr. B. Bell, Faraday said, “Lord Melbourne\r\nbehaved very handsomely in the matter.”\r\n\r\nIn _Fraser’s Magazine_ for February, 1836 (vol. xiii., p. 224), is\r\na portrait of Faraday by Maclise, accompanied by a very amusing\r\nbiographical notice by Dr. Maginn. The picture represents Faraday\r\nlecturing, and surrounded by his apparatus. The article begins thus:--\r\n\r\n    Here you have him in his glory--not that his position was\r\n    _inglorious_ when he stood before Melbourne, then decorated\r\n    with a blue velvet travelling cap, and lounging with one\r\n    leg over the chair of Canning!--and distinctly gave that\r\n    illustrious despiser of “humbug” to understand that he had\r\n    mistaken his lad. No! but here you have him as he first\r\n    flashed upon the intelligence of mankind the condensation of\r\n    the gases, or the identity of the five electricities.\r\n\r\nAfter a lively summary of his career, and the jocular suggestion that,\r\nas the successor of Sir Humphry Davy, Far-a-day must be near-a-knight\r\nthe article continues:--\r\n\r\n    The future Baronet is a very good little fellow ... playing a\r\n    fair fork over a leg of mutton, and devoid of any reluctance\r\n    to partake an old friend’s third bottle. We know of few things\r\n    more agreeable than a cigar and a bowl of punch (which he mixes\r\n    admirably) in the society of the unpretending ex-bookbinder....\r\n\r\n    Well, although Young got Broderip to write a sort of defence of\r\n    his master, and “Justice B----”--_mirabile dictu!_--got Hook\r\n    to print it in the _John Bull_, the current of public feeling\r\n    could not be stopped: REGINA spoke out--WILLIAM REX, as in duty\r\n    bound, followed--Melbourne apologised--and “Michael’s pension,\r\n    Michael’s pension” is all right.\r\n\r\nIn one of his note-books of this period is found the following entry:--\r\n\r\n                                        15 January, 1834.\r\n\r\n    Within the last week have observed twice that a slight\r\n    obscurity of the sight of my left eye has happened. It occurred\r\n    on reading the letters of a book held about fourteen inches\r\n    from the eye, being obscured as by a fog over a space about\r\n    half an inch in diameter. This space was a little to the right\r\n    and below the axes of the eye. Looking for the effect now and\r\n    other times, I cannot perceive it. I note this down that I may\r\n    hereafter trace the progress of the effect if it increases or\r\n    becomes more common.\r\n\r\nHappily, the trouble did not recur; but the entry is characteristic\r\nof the habits of accuracy of the man. Loss of memory, unfortunately,\r\nearly set in. There is actually a hint of this in the first of\r\nhis letters to Abbott (p. 7), and references to the trouble and to\r\ndizziness in the head recur perpetually in his correspondence. Whenever\r\nthese brain-troubles threatened, he was compelled to drop all work\r\nand seek rest and change of scene. He often ran down to Brighton,\r\nwhich he thought, however, a poor place. He constructed for himself a\r\nvelocipede[15] on which to take exercise. Two or three times he went to\r\nSwitzerland for a longer holiday, usually accompanied by his wife and\r\nher brother, George Barnard.\r\n\r\n“Physically,” says Tyndall, “Faraday was below the middle size, well\r\nset, active, and with extraordinary animation of countenance. His head\r\nfrom forehead to back was so long that he had usually to bespeak his\r\nhats.” In youth his hair was brown, curling naturally; later in life it\r\napproached to white, and he always parted it down the middle. His voice\r\nwas pleasant, his laugh was hearty, his manners when with young people,\r\nor when excited by success in the laboratory, were gay to boyishness.\r\nIndeed, until the end of the active period of his life he never lost\r\nthe capacity for boyish delight, or for unbending in fun after the\r\nstress of severe labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES: FIRST PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom first to last the original scientific researches of Faraday extend\r\nover a period of forty-four years, beginning with an analysis of\r\ncaustic lime, published in the _Quarterly Journal of Science_ in 1816,\r\nand ending with his last unfinished researches of 1860 to 1862, on\r\nthe possible existence of new relations between magnetism and gravity\r\nand between magnetism and light. The mere list of their titles fills\r\nseveral pages in the catalogue of scientific papers published by the\r\nRoyal Society.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of description, these forty-four years may be divided\r\ninto three periods: the first lasting from 1816 to 1830, a period of\r\nmiscellaneous and in some respects preliminary activity; the second\r\nfrom 1831 to the end of 1839, the period of the classical experimental\r\nresearches in electricity down to the time when they were temporarily\r\nsuspended by the serious state of his health; the third from 1844, when\r\nhe was able to resume work, down to 1860, a period which includes the\r\ncompletion of the experimental researches on electricity, the discovery\r\nof the relations between light and magnetism, and that of diamagnetism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESEARCHES BEGINNING.]\r\n\r\nFaraday’s first research was an analysis for Sir Humphry Davy of a\r\nspecimen of caustic lime which had been sent to him by the Duchess\r\nof Montrose from Tuscany. The _Quarterly Journal of Science_, in\r\nwhich it appeared, was a precursor of the _Proceedings of the Royal\r\nInstitution_, and was indeed edited by Professor W. F. Brande. Faraday\r\nfrequently wrote for it during these years, and took editorial\r\ncharge of it on more than one occasion during Brande’s holidays. The\r\npaper on caustic lime was reprinted by Faraday in the volume of his\r\n“Experimental Researches on Chemistry and Physics,” prefaced by the\r\nfollowing note:--\r\n\r\n    I reprint this paper at full length; it was the beginning\r\n    of my communications to the public, and in its results very\r\n    important to me. Sir Humphry Davy gave me the analysis to\r\n    make as a first attempt in chemistry, at a time when my fear\r\n    was greater than my confidence, and both far greater than\r\n    my knowledge; at a time also when I had no thought of ever\r\n    writing an original paper on science. The addition of his own\r\n    comments, and the publication of the paper, encouraged me to\r\n    go on making, from time to time, other slight communications,\r\n    some of which appear in this volume. Their transference from\r\n    the _Quarterly_ into other journals increased my boldness,\r\n    and now that forty years have elapsed, and I can look back on\r\n    what successive communications have led to, I still hope, much\r\n    as their character has changed, that I have not either now or\r\n    forty years ago been too bold.\r\n\r\nFor the next two or three years Faraday was very closely occupied in\r\nthe duties of assisting Sir Humphry Davy in his researches, and in\r\nhelping to prepare the lectures for both Davy and Brande. Yet he\r\nfound time still to work on his own account. In 1817 he had six papers\r\nand notes in the _Quarterly Journal of Science_, including one on the\r\nescape of gases through capillary tubes, and others on wire-gauze\r\nsafety lamps and Davy’s experiments on flame. In 1818 he had eleven\r\npapers in the _Journal_; the most important being on the production of\r\nsound in tubes by flames, while another was on the combustion of the\r\ndiamond. In 1819 he had nineteen papers in the _Quarterly Journal_,\r\nchiefly of a chemical nature. These related to boracic acid, the\r\ncomposition of steels, the separation of manganese from iron, and on\r\nthe supposed new metal, “Sirium” or “Vestium,” which he showed to be\r\nonly a mixture of iron and sulphur with nickel, cobalt, and other\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OERSTED’S DISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1820 was marked in the annals of science by the discovery,\r\nby Oersted of Copenhagen, of the prime fact of electromagnetism, the\r\ndeflexion which is produced upon a magnetic needle by an electric\r\ncurrent that passes either under or over the needle. Often had it been\r\nsuspected that there must be some connection between the phenomena\r\nof electricity and those of magnetism. The similarities between the\r\nattractions and repulsions caused by electrified bodies, and those\r\ndue to the magnet when acting on iron, had constantly suggested the\r\npossibility that there was some real connection. But, as had been\r\npointed out centuries before by St. Augustine, while the rubbed\r\namber will attract any substance if only small or light enough,\r\nbeing indifferent to its material, the magnet will only attract iron\r\nor compounds of iron, and is totally inoperative[16] on all other\r\nsubstances. Again, while it had been noticed that in houses which had\r\nbeen struck by lightning knives, needles, and other steel objects near\r\nthe path of the electric flash had become magnetised, no one had been\r\nable, by using the most powerful electric machines, to repeat with\r\ncertainty the magnetisation of needles. In vain they had tried to\r\nmagnetise knives and wires by sending sparks through them. Sometimes\r\nthey showed a trace of magnetism, sometimes none. And in the cases\r\nwhere some slight magnetisation resulted, the polarity could not be\r\ndepended upon. Van Swinden had written a whole treatise in two volumes\r\non the analogies between electricity and magnetism, but left the real\r\nrelation between the two more obscure than ever. After the invention,\r\nin 1800, of the voltaic pile, which for the first time provided a\r\nmeans of generating a steady flow or current of electricity, several\r\nexperimenters, including Oersted himself, had again essayed to discover\r\nthe long-suspected connection, but without success. Oersted was\r\nnotoriously a poor experimenter, though a man of great philosophical\r\ngenius. Having in 1820 a more powerful voltaic battery in operation\r\nthan previously, he repeated[17] the operation of bringing near to the\r\ncompass needle the copper wire that conveyed the current; and, laying\r\nit parallel to the needle’s direction, and over or under it, found that\r\nthe needle tended to turn into a direction at right angles to the line\r\nof the current, the sense of the deviation depending upon the direction\r\nof flow of the current, and also on the position of the wire as to\r\nwhether it were above or below the needle. A current flowing from south\r\nto north over the needle caused the north-pointing end of the needle to\r\nbe deflected westwards. If the wire were vertical, so that the current\r\nflowed downwards, and a compass needle was brought near the wire on the\r\nsouth side, therefore tending under the earth’s directive influence to\r\npoint northwards toward the wire, it was observed that the effect of\r\nthe current flowing in the wire was to cause the north-pointing end of\r\nthe needle to turn westwards. Or, reversing the flow of current, the\r\neffect on the needle was reversed; it now tended eastwards. All these\r\nthings Oersted summed up in the phrase that “the electric conflict acts\r\nin a revolving manner” around the wire.[18] In modern phraseology the\r\nwhole of the actions are explained if one can conceive that the effect\r\nof the electric flow in the wire is to tend to make the north pole of\r\na magnet revolve in one sense around the wire, whilst it also tends\r\nto make the south pole of the magnet revolve around the wire in the\r\nother sense. The nett result in most cases is that the magnetic needle\r\ntends to set itself square across the line of the current. Oersted\r\nhimself was not too clear in his explanations, and seems, in his later\r\npapers, to have lost sight of the circular motion amidst repulsions and\r\nattractions.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, which showed what was the geometrical relation between\r\nthe magnet and the current, also showed why the earlier attempts had\r\nfailed. It was requisite that the electricity should be in a state\r\nof steady flow; neither at rest as in the experiments with electric\r\ncharges, nor yet in capricious or oscillatory rush as in those with\r\nspark-discharges. Faraday, adverting a quarter of a century later to\r\nOersted’s discovery, said: “It burst open the gates of a domain in\r\nscience, dark till then, and filled it with a flood of light.”\r\n\r\nThe very day that Oersted’s memoir was published in England, Davy\r\nbrought a copy down into the laboratory of the Royal Institution, and\r\nhe and Faraday at once set to work to repeat the experiments and verify\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of history how, on the publication of Oersted’s\r\ndiscovery, Ampère leaped forward to generalise on electromagnetic\r\nactions, and discovered the mutual actions that may exist between two\r\ncurrents, or rather between two conducting wires that carry currents.\r\nThey are found to experience mutual mechanical forces urging them into\r\nparallel proximity. Biot and Laplace added to these investigations,\r\nas also did Arago. Davy discovered that the naked copper wire, while\r\ncarrying a current, could attract iron filings to itself--not end-ways\r\nin adherent tufts, as the pole of a magnet does, but laterally, each\r\nfiling or chainlet of filings tending to set itself tangentially at\r\nright angles to the axis of the wire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A PARADOXICAL PHENOMENON.]\r\n\r\nThis curious right-angled relation between electric flow and magnetic\r\nforce came as a complete paradox or puzzle to the scientific world.\r\nIt had taken centuries to throw off the strange unmechanical ideas of\r\nforce which had dominated the older astronomy. The epicyclic motions\r\nof the planets postulated by the Ptolemaic system were in no way to be\r\naccounted for upon mechanical principles. Kepler’s laws of planetary\r\nmotion were merely empirical, embodying the results of observation,\r\nuntil Newton’s discovery of the laws of circular motion and of the\r\nprinciple of universal gravitation placed the planetary theory on\r\na rational basis. Newton’s laws required that forces should act in\r\nstraight lines, and that to every action there should be an equal and\r\nopposite reaction. If A attracted B, then B attracted A with an equal\r\nforce, and the mutual force must be in the line drawn from A to B. The\r\ndiscovery by Oersted that the magnet pole was urged by the electric\r\nwire in a direction _transverse_ to the line joining them, appeared at\r\nfirst sight to contravene the ideas of force so thoroughly established\r\nby Newton. How could this transversality be explained? Some sought to\r\nexplain the effect by considering the conducting wire to operate as if\r\nmade up of a number of short magnets set transversely across the wire,\r\nall their north poles being set towards the right, and all their south\r\npoles towards the left. Ampère took the alternative view that the\r\nmagnet might be regarded as equivalent to a number of electric currents\r\ncirculating transversely around the core as an axis. In neither case\r\nwas the explanation complete.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TWO YEARS WASTED.]\r\n\r\nFaraday’s scientific activities in the year 1820 were very marked. New\r\nresearches on steel had been going on for some months. It had been\r\nhoped that by alloying iron with some other metals, such as silver,\r\nplatinum, or nickel, a non-rusting alloy might be found. This idea\r\ntook its rise from the erroneous notion that meteoric iron, which\r\nis richly alloyed with nickel, does not rust. Faraday found nickel\r\nsteel to be more readily oxidised, not less, than ordinary steel. The\r\nplatinum steel was also a failure. Silver steel was of more interest,\r\nthough it was found impossible to incorporate in the alloy more than\r\na small percentage of silver. Nevertheless, silver steel was used\r\nfor some time by a Sheffield firm for manufacture of fenders. The\r\nalloys of iron with platinum, iridium, and rhodium were also of no\r\ngreat use. But the research demonstrated the surprising effects which\r\nminute quantities of other metals may have upon the quality of steel.\r\nOccasionally in later life Faraday would present one of his friends\r\nwith a razor made from his own special steel. A paper on the use of\r\nalloys of steel in surgical instrument making was published in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal_ in collaboration with Mr. Stodart. Faraday also\r\nread his first paper before the Royal Society on two new compounds\r\nof chlorine and carbon, and on a new compound of iodine, carbon,\r\nand hydrogen. He also succeeded in making artificial plumbago from\r\ncharcoal. In writing to his friend Professor G. de la Rive, he gives\r\na long and chatty abstract of his researches on the alloys of steel.\r\nThey appear to have originated in some analyses of wootz or Indian\r\nsteel, a material which, when etched with acid, shows a beautifully\r\ndamascened or reticulated surface. This effect Faraday never found with\r\npure steel, but imitated it successfully with a steel alloyed with “the\r\nmetal of alumine,” an element which down to that time had not been\r\nisolated. He then describes the rhodium, silver, and nickel steels, and\r\nmentions incidentally how he has been surprised to discover that he\r\ncan volatilise silver, and that he cannot reduce the metal titanium.\r\nHe is doubtful whether this metal “ever has been reduced at all in the\r\npure state.” [It can now be readily reduced either in the electric arc\r\nor by the use of metallic aluminium.] He winds up the letter with the\r\nwords: “Pray pity us that, after two years’ experiments, we have got no\r\nfurther; but I am sure, if you knew the labour of the experiments, you\r\nwould applaud us for our perseverance at least.”\r\n\r\nIn 1821, the year of his marriage, came the first of the important\r\nscientific discoveries which brought him international fame. This\r\nwas the discovery of the electromagnetic rotations. It appears that\r\nOersted’s brilliant flash of insight that the “electric conflict acts\r\nin a revolving manner” upon the pole of the neighbouring compass needle\r\nhad been lost sight of in the discussions which followed, and to\r\nwhich allusion has been made above. All the world was thinking about\r\nattractions and repulsions. Two men, however, seem to have gone a\r\nlittle further in their ideas. Dr. Wollaston had suggested that there\r\nought to be a tendency, when a magnet pole was presented towards a\r\nstraight conducting wire carrying a current, for that conducting wire\r\nto revolve around its own axis. This effect--though in recent years\r\nit has been observed by Mr. George Gore--he unsuccessfully tried to\r\nobserve by experiments. He came in April, 1821, to the laboratory\r\nof the Royal Institution to make an experiment, but without result.\r\nFaraday, at the request of his friend Phillips, who was editor of the\r\n_Annals of Philosophy_, wrote for that magazine in July, August, and\r\nSeptember a historical sketch of electromagnetism down to date. This\r\nwas one of the very few of Faraday’s writings that was anonymous. It\r\nwas simply signed “M.” This is in vol. iii. p. 107. On p. 117 the\r\neditor says: “To the historical sketch of electromagnetism with which I\r\nhave been favoured by my anonymous correspondent, I shall add a sketch\r\nof the discoveries that have been made by Mr. Faraday of the Royal\r\nInstitution.” In the course of this work Faraday repeated for his own\r\nsatisfaction almost all the experiments that he described. This led him\r\nto discover that a wire, included in the circuit, but mounted so as to\r\nhang with its lower end in a pool of quicksilver, could rotate around\r\nthe pole of a magnet; and conversely that if the wire were fixed and\r\nthe pole of the magnet free to move, the latter would rotate around the\r\nformer. “I did not realise,” he wrote, “Dr. Wollaston’s expectation\r\nof the rotation of the electromagnetic wire around its axis.” As was\r\nso often his custom, he had no sooner finished the research for\r\npublication than he dashed off a brief summary of it in a letter to one\r\nof his friends. On this occasion it was Professor G. de la Rive, of\r\nGeneva, who was the recipient of his confidences. On September 12 he\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LETTER TO DE LA RIVE.]\r\n\r\n    I am much flattered and encouraged to go on by your good\r\n    opinion of what little things I have been able to do in\r\n    science, and especially as regards the chlorides of carbon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    You partly reproach us here with not sufficiently esteeming\r\n    Ampère’s experiments on electromagnetism. Allow me to extenuate\r\n    your opinion a little on this point. With regard to the\r\n    experiments, I hope and trust that due weight is allowed to\r\n    them; but these you know are few, and theory makes up the great\r\n    part of what M. Ampère has published, and theory in a great\r\n    many points unsupported by experiments when they ought to have\r\n    been adduced. At the same time, M. Ampère’s experiments are\r\n    excellent, and his theory ingenious; and, for myself, I had\r\n    thought very little about it before your letter came, simply\r\n    because, being naturally sceptical on philosophical theories, I\r\n    thought there was a great want of experimental evidence. Since\r\n    then, however, I have engaged on the subject, and have a paper\r\n    in our “Institution Journal,” which will appear in a week or\r\n    two, and that will, as it contains experiment, be immediately\r\n    applied by M. Ampère in support of his theory, much more\r\n    decidedly than it is by myself. I intend to enclose a copy of\r\n    it to you with the other, and only want the means of sending it.\r\n\r\n    I find all the usual attractions and repulsions of the magnetic\r\n    needle by the conjunctive wire are deceptions, the motions\r\n    being not attractions or repulsions, nor the result of any\r\n    attractive or repulsive forces, but the result of a force in\r\n    the wire, which instead of bringing the pole of the needle\r\n    nearer to, or further from the wire, endeavours to make it\r\n    move round it in a never ending circle and motion whilst the\r\n    battery remains in action. I have succeeded not only in showing\r\n    the existence of this motion theoretically, but experimentally,\r\n    and have been able to make the wire revolve round a magnetic\r\n    pole, or a magnetic pole round the wire, at pleasure. The law\r\n    of revolution, and to which all the other motions of the needle\r\n    and wire are reducible, is simple and beautiful.\r\n\r\n    Conceive a portion of connecting wire north and south, the\r\n    north end being attached to the positive pole of a battery, the\r\n    south to the negative. A north magnetic pole would then pass\r\n    round it continually in the apparent direction of the sun, from\r\n    east to west above, from west to east below.\r\n\r\n    Reverse the connections with the battery, and the motion of the\r\n    pole is reversed; or if the south pole be made to revolve, the\r\n    motions will be in the opposite directions, as with the north\r\n    pole.\r\n\r\n    If the wire be made to revolve round the pole, the motions are\r\n    according to those mentioned. In the apparatus I used there\r\n    were but two plates, and the directions of the motions were of\r\n    course[19] the reverse of those with a battery of several pairs\r\n    of plates, and which are given above. Now I have been able,\r\n    experimentally, to trace this motion into its various forms as\r\n    exhibited by Ampère’s, Nelice’s, &c., and in all cases to show\r\n    that the attractions and repulsions are only appearances due\r\n    to this circulation of the pole, to show that dissimilar poles\r\n    repel as well as attract, and that similar poles attract as\r\n    well as repel, and to make, I think, the analogy between the\r\n    helix and common bar magnet far stronger than before. But yet I\r\n    am by no means decided that there are currents of electricity\r\n    in the common magnet.\r\n\r\n    I have no doubt that electricity puts the circles of the\r\n    helix into the same state as those circles are in, that may\r\n    be conceived in the bar magnet, but I am not certain that\r\n    this state is directly dependant on the electricity, or that\r\n    it cannot be produced by other agencies; and therefore, until\r\n    the presence of electrical currents be proved in the magnet by\r\n    other than magnetical effects, I shall remain in doubt about\r\n    Ampère’s theory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Wishing you all health and happiness, and waiting for news from\r\n    you,\r\n\r\n    I am, my dear Sir, your very obliged and grateful\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reference at the beginning of this letter to the chlorides of\r\ncarbon has to do with his discovery communicated to the Royal Society.\r\nLater in the year, a joint paper on another compound of carbon and\r\nchlorine, by himself and his friend Richard Phillips, was sent in. Both\r\nwere printed together in the _Philosophical Transactions_ of 1821.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEAVES FROM THE NOTE-BOOK.]\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from Faraday’s laboratory book relating to\r\nthe discovery. The account is incomplete, a leaf having been torn out:--\r\n\r\n                                        1821, Sept. 3.\r\n\r\n    The effort of the wire is always to pass off at a right angle\r\n    from the pole, indeed to go in a circle round it, so when\r\n    either pole was brought up to the wire perpendicular to it and\r\n    to the radius of the circle it described, there was neither\r\n    attraction nor repulsion, but the moment the pole varied in the\r\n    slightest manner either in or out, the wire moved one way or\r\n    the other.\r\n\r\n    The poles of the magnet act on the bent wire in all positions\r\n    and not in the direction _only_ of any axis of the magnet, so\r\n    that the current can hardly be cylindrical or arranged round\r\n    the axis of a cylinder?\r\n\r\n    From the motion above a north magnet pole in the centre of one\r\n    of the circles should make the wire continually turn round.\r\n    Arranged a magnet needle in a glass tube with mercury about it,\r\n    and by a cork, water, &c., supported a connecting wire so that\r\n    the upper end should go into the silver cup and its mercury,\r\n    and the lower move in a channel of mercury round the pole of\r\n    the needle. The battery arranged with the wire as before. In\r\n    this way got the revolution of the wire round the pole of the\r\n    magnet. The direction was as follow, looking from above down:--\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 2. (FACSIMILE OF ORIGINAL SKETCH.)]\r\n\r\n    Very satisfactory, but make more sensible apparatus.\r\n\r\n                                        Tuesday, Sept. 4.\r\n\r\n    Apparatus for revolution of wire and magnet. A deep basin with\r\n    bit of wax at bottom and then filled with mercury. A magnet\r\n    stuck upright in wax so that pole just above the surface of\r\n    mercury. Then piece of wire floated by cork at lower end\r\n    dipping into merc^y and above into silver cup as before:--\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 3. (FACSIMILE OF ORIGINAL SKETCH.)]\r\n\r\nThe research on the electromagnetic rotations, which was published in\r\nthe _Quarterly Journal of Science_ for October, 1821 (and reprinted in\r\nthe second volume of the “Experimental Researches in Electricity”), was\r\nthe occasion of a very serious misunderstanding with Dr. Wollaston and\r\nhis friends, which at one time threatened to cause Faraday’s exclusion\r\nfrom the Royal Society. Faraday’s prompt and frank action in appealing\r\nto Dr. Wollaston saved him in a very unpleasant crisis; and the latter\r\ncame three or four times to the laboratory to witness the experiments.\r\nOn Christmas Day of the same year, Faraday succeeded in making a wire\r\nthrough which an electric current is passing move under the influence\r\nof the earth’s magnetism alone. His brother-in-law, George Barnard, who\r\nwas in the laboratory at the time, wrote:--“All at once he exclaimed,\r\n‘Do you see, do you see, do you see, George?’ as the wire began to\r\nrevolve. One end I recollect was in the cup of quicksilver, the other\r\nattached above to the centre. I shall never forget the enthusiasm\r\nexpressed in his face and the sparkling in his eyes!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCENES IN THE LABORATORY.]\r\n\r\nIn 1822 little was added to Faraday’s scientific work. He had a\r\njoint paper with Stodart on steel before the Royal Society, and\r\nin the _Quarterly Journal_ two short chemical papers and four on\r\nelectromagnetical motions and magnetism. He had long kept a commonplace\r\nbook in which he entered notes and queries as well as extracts from\r\nbooks and journals; but this year he began a fresh manuscript volume,\r\ninto which he transferred many of the queries and suggestions of\r\nhis own originating. This volume he called “Chemical Notes, Hints,\r\nSuggestions, and Objects of Pursuit.” It contains many of the germs of\r\nhis own future discoveries, as the following examples show:--\r\n\r\n    Convert magnetism into electricity.\r\n\r\n    Do pith balls diverge by disturbance of electricities in\r\n    consequence of induction or not?\r\n\r\n    General effects of compression, either in condensing gases,\r\n    or producing solutions, or even giving combinations at low\r\n    temperatures.\r\n\r\n    Light through gold leaf on to zine or most oxidable metals,\r\n    these being poles--or on magnetic bars.\r\n\r\n    Transparency of metals. Sun’s light through gold leaf. Two gold\r\n    leaves made poles--light passed through one to the other.\r\n\r\nWhenever any query found an answer, he drew his pen through it and\r\nadded the date. In front of the book--probably at some later time--he\r\nwrote these words:--\r\n\r\n    I already owe much to these notes, and think such a collection\r\n    worth the making by every scientific man. I am sure none would\r\n    think the trouble lost after a year’s experience.\r\n\r\nA striking example had already occurred of similar suggestive notes in\r\nthe optical queries of Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\nIn another manuscript notebook occur the following entries under date\r\nof September 10, 1821:--\r\n\r\n    2 similar poles though they repell at most distances attract at\r\n    very small distances and adhere. Query why....\r\n\r\n    Could not magnetise a plate of steel so as to resemble flat\r\n    spiral. Either the magnetism would be very weak and irregular\r\n    or there would be none at all.\r\n\r\nThese are interesting as showing how Faraday was educating himself\r\nby continual experiment. The explanation of each of these paradoxes\r\nhas long passed into the commonplace of physics; but they would still\r\npuzzle many who have learned their science bookishly at second-hand.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that amongst the entries cited above there are two of\r\nabsolutely capital importance, one foreshadowing the great discovery\r\nof magneto-electric induction, the other indicating how the existence\r\nof electro-optical relations was shaping itself as a possibility in\r\nFaraday’s mind. An entry in his laboratory book of September 10 is of\r\ngreat interest:--\r\n\r\n    Polarised a ray of lamp-light by reflection, and endeavoured to\r\n    ascertain whether any depolarising action [is] exerted on it by\r\n    water placed between the poles of a voltaic battery in a glass\r\n    cistern; one Wollaston’s trough used; the fluids decomposed\r\n    were pure water, weak solution of sulphate of soda, and strong\r\n    sulphuric acid: none of them had any effect on the polarised\r\n    light, either when out of or in the voltaic circuit, so that\r\n    no particular arrangement of particles could be ascertained in\r\n    this way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN UNSUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT.]\r\n\r\nIt may be added that no such optical effect of electrolytic conduction\r\nas that here looked for has yet been discovered. The experiment,\r\nunsuccessful at that day, remains still an unsuccessful one. A singular\r\ninterest attaches to it, however, and it was repeated several times by\r\nFaraday in subsequent years, in hope of some results.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 Faraday read two papers to the Royal Society, one on Liquid\r\nChlorine, the other on the Condensation of several Gases into Liquids.\r\nNo sooner was the work completed than he dashed off a letter to De la\r\nRive to tell him what he had accomplished. Under date March 24, 1823,\r\nhe writes:--\r\n\r\n    I have been at work lately, and obtained results which I\r\n    hope you will approve of. I have been interrupted twice in\r\n    the course of experiments by explosions, both in the course\r\n    of eight days--one burnt my eyes, the other cut them; but\r\n    fortunately escaped with slight injury only in both cases, and\r\n    am now nearly well. During the winter I took the opportunity\r\n    of examining the hydrate of chlorine, and analysing it; the\r\n    results, which are not very important, will appear in the\r\n    next number of the _Quarterly Journal_, over which I have no\r\n    influence. Sir H. Davy, on seeing my paper, suggested to me to\r\n    work with it under pressure, and see what would happen by heat,\r\n    &c. Accordingly I enclosed it in a glass tube hermetically\r\n    sealed, heated it, obtained a change in the substance, and\r\n    a separation into two different fluids; and upon further\r\n    examination I found that the chlorine and water had separated\r\n    from each other, and the chlorine gas, not being able to\r\n    escape, had condensed into the liquid form. To prove that it\r\n    contained no water, I dried some chlorine gas, introduced it\r\n    into a long tube, condensed it, and then cooled the tube, and\r\n    again obtained fluid chlorine. Hence what is called chlorine\r\n    gas is the vapour of a fluid....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I expect to be able to reduce many other gases to the liquid\r\n    form, and promise myself the pleasure of writing you about\r\n    them. I hope you will honour me with a letter soon.\r\n\r\n    I am, dear Sir, very faithfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHLORINE LIQUEFIED.]\r\n\r\nThe work of liquefying the gases had been taken up by Faraday\r\nduring his hours of liberty from other duties. It was probably his\r\ncharacteristic dislike to “doubtful knowledge” which prompted him to\r\nre-examine a substance which had at one time been regarded as chlorine\r\nin a solid state, but which Davy in 1810 had demonstrated to be a\r\nhydrate of that element. The first work was, as narrated above, to make\r\na new analysis of the supposed substance. This analysis, duly written\r\nout, was submitted to Sir Humphry, who, without stating precisely what\r\nresults he anticipated might follow, suggested heating the hydrate\r\nunder pressure in a hermetically sealed glass tube. This Faraday did.\r\nWhen so heated, the tube filled with a yellow atmosphere, and on\r\ncooling was found to contain two liquids, one limpid and colourless\r\nlike water, the other of an oily appearance. Concerning this research\r\na curious story is told in the life of Davy. Dr. Paris, Davy’s friend\r\nand biographer, happened to visit the laboratory while Faraday was at\r\nwork on these tubes. Seeing the oily liquid, he ventured to rally the\r\nyoung assistant upon his carelessness in employing greasy tubes. Later\r\nin the day, Faraday, on filing off the end of the tube, was startled by\r\nfinding the contents suddenly to explode; the oily matter completely\r\ndisappearing. He speedily ascertained the cause. The gas, liberated\r\nfrom combination with water by heat, had under the pressure of its own\r\nevolution liquefied itself, only to re-expand with violence when the\r\ntube was opened. Early the next day Dr. Paris received the following\r\nlaconic note:--\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\n    The _oil_ you noticed yesterday turns out to be liquid chlorine.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours faithfully,\r\n                                                  M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\nLater he adopted a compressing syringe to condense the gas, and again\r\nsucceeded in liquefying it. Davy, who added a characteristic note to\r\nFaraday’s published paper, immediately applied the same method of\r\nliquefaction by its own pressure to hydrochloric acid gas; and Faraday\r\nreduced a number of other gases by the same means. These researches\r\nwere not without danger. In the preliminary experiments an explosion\r\nof one of the tubes drove thirteen fragments of glass into Faraday’s\r\neye. At the end of the year he drew up a historical statement on the\r\nliquefaction of gases, which was published in the _Quarterly Journal_\r\nfor January, 1824. A further statement by him was published in the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_ for 1836; and in 1844 his further researches\r\non the liquefaction of gases were published in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Faraday again brought to the Royal Society a chemical discovery\r\nof first importance. The paper was on some new compounds of carbon and\r\nhydrogen, and on certain other products obtained during decomposition\r\nof oil by heat. From condensed oil-gas, so obtained, Faraday succeeded\r\nin separating the liquid known as benzin or benzol, or, as he named it\r\nat the time, bicarburet of hydrogen. It has since its discovery formed\r\nthe basis of several great chemical industries, and is manufactured in\r\nvast quantities. Prior to the reading of this paper he had, as we have\r\nalready related, been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, an honour\r\nto which he had for some years aspired, and which stood alone in his\r\nregard above the scientific honours of later years.\r\n\r\nIn this year he tried, amongst his unsuccessful experiments, two of\r\nsingular interest. One was an attempt to find whether two crystals\r\n(such as nitre) exercised upon one another any polar attractions like\r\nthose of two lodestones. He suspended them by fibres of cocoon silk,\r\nand, finding this material not delicate enough, by spider-lines. The\r\nother was an attempt to discover magneto-electricity. For various\r\nreasons he concluded that the approximation of the pole of a powerful\r\nmagnet to a conductor carrying a current would have the effect of\r\ndiminishing the amount of that current. He placed magnets within a\r\ncopper wire helix, and observed with a galvanometer whether the current\r\nsent through the circuit of the helix by a given battery was less when\r\nthe magnet was absent. The result was negative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESEARCH ON OPTICAL GLASS.]\r\n\r\nIn this year also began the laborious researches on optical glass,\r\nwhich though in themselves leading to no immediate success of\r\ncommercial value, nevertheless furnished Faraday with the material\r\nessential at the time for the making of the most momentous of all\r\nhis discoveries. A committee had been appointed by the President and\r\nCouncil of the Royal Society for the improvement of glass for optical\r\npurposes, and Faraday was amongst those chosen to act upon it.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the Royal Society Committee delegated the investigation of\r\noptical glass to a sub-committee of three, Herschel (afterwards\r\nSir John), Dollond (the optician), and Faraday. The chemical part,\r\nincluding the experimental manufacture, was entrusted to Faraday.\r\nDollond was to work the glass and test its qualities from the\r\ninstrument maker’s point of view, whilst Herschel was to examine\r\nits refraction, dispersion, and other physical properties. This\r\nsub-committee worked for nearly five years, though by the removal of\r\nHerschel from England its number was reduced to two. In 1827 the work\r\nbecame more arduous. Faraday thus writes:--\r\n\r\n    The President and Council of the Royal Society applied to the\r\n    President and Managers of the Royal Institution for leave to\r\n    erect on their premises an experimental room with a furnace,\r\n    for the purpose of continuing the investigation on the\r\n    manufacture of optical glass. They were guided in this by the\r\n    desire which the Royal Institution has always evinced to assist\r\n    in the advancement of science; and the readiness with which the\r\n    application was granted showed that no mistaken notion had been\r\n    formed in this respect. As a member of both bodies, I felt much\r\n    anxiety that the investigation should be successful. A room\r\n    and furnaces were built at the Royal Institution in September,\r\n    1827, and an assistant was engaged, Sergeant Anderson, of the\r\n    Royal Artillery. He came on the 3rd of December.\r\n\r\nAnderson, who was thus made assistant to Faraday, remained in that\r\ncapacity till his death in 1866. He was a most devoted servant. In a\r\nfootnote to the “Experimental Researches” (vol. iii. p. 3) Faraday in\r\n1845 wrote of him:--\r\n\r\n    I cannot resist the occasion that is thus offered me of\r\n    mentioning the name of Mr. Anderson, who came to me as an\r\n    assistant in the glass experiments, and has remained ever since\r\n    in the laboratory of the Royal Institution. He assisted me in\r\n    all the researches into which I have entered since that time;\r\n    and to his care, steadiness, exactitude, and faithfulness in\r\n    the performance of all that has been committed to his charge, I\r\n    am much indebted.--M. F.\r\n\r\nTyndall, who had a great admiration for Anderson, declared that\r\nhis merits as an assistant might be summed up in one phrase--blind\r\nobedience. The story is told of him by Benjamin Abbott:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANDERSON’S OBEDIENCE.]\r\n\r\n    Sergeant Anderson ... was chosen simply because of the habits\r\n    of strict obedience his military training had given him. His\r\n    duty was to keep the furnaces always at the same heat, and the\r\n    water in the ashpit always at the same level. In the evening\r\n    he was released, but one night Faraday forgot to tell Anderson\r\n    he could go home, and early next morning he found his faithful\r\n    servant still stoking the glowing furnace, as he had been doing\r\n    all night long.\r\n\r\nThe research on optical glass was viewed askance by several parties.\r\nThe expenditure of money which it involved was one of the “charges”\r\nhurled against the Council of the Royal Society by Sir James South in\r\n1830. Nevertheless it was deemed sufficiently important to receive\r\npowerful support, as the following letter shows:--\r\n\r\n                                        Admiralty, 20 Dec., 1827.\r\n\r\n    SIR,\r\n\r\n    I hereby request, on behalf of the Board of Longitude, that you\r\n    will continue, in the furnace built at the Royal Institution,\r\n    the experiments on glass, directed by the joint Committee\r\n    of the Royal Society and the Board of Longitude and already\r\n    sanctioned by the Treasury and the Board of Excise.\r\n\r\n                              I am, Sir,\r\n                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n                                        THOMAS YOUNG, M.D.,\r\n                                               Sec. Bd. Long.\r\n\r\n  Michael Faraday, Esq.,\r\n            Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1825, Faraday’s duties towards the Royal Institution were\r\nsomewhat modified. Hitherto he had been nominally a mere assistant\r\nto Davy and Brande, though he had occasionally undertaken lectures\r\nfor the latter. Now, on Davy’s recommendation, he was, as we have\r\nseen, appointed by the managers Director of the Laboratory under\r\nthe superintendence of the Professor of Chemistry. He was relieved,\r\n“because of his occupation in research,” from his duty as chemical\r\nassistant at the lectures.\r\n\r\nThe research on optical glass was not concluded till 1829, when\r\nits results were communicated to the Royal Society in the Bakerian\r\nlecture of that year--a memoir so long that it is said three sittings\r\nwere occupied in its delivery. It is printed _in extenso_ in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ of 1830. It opens as follows:--\r\n\r\n    When the philosopher desires to apply glass in the construction\r\n    of perfect instruments, and especially the achromatic\r\n    telescope, its manufacture is found liable to imperfections so\r\n    important and so difficult to avoid, that science is frequently\r\n    stopped in her progress by them--a fact fully proved by the\r\n    circumstance that Mr. Dollond, one of our first opticians, has\r\n    not been able to obtain a disc of flint glass 4½ inches in\r\n    diameter, fit for a telescope, within the last five years; or a\r\n    similar disc, of 5 inches, within the last ten years.\r\n\r\n    This led to the appointment by Sir H. Davy of the Royal Society\r\n    Committee, and the Government removed the excise restrictions,\r\n    and undertook to bear all the expenses as long as the\r\n    investigation offered a reasonable hope of success.\r\n\r\n    The experiments were begun at the Falcon Glass Works, three\r\n    miles from the Royal Institution, and continued there in\r\n    1825, 1826, and to Sept., 1827, when a room was built at the\r\n    Institution. At first the inquiry was pursued principally as\r\n    related to flint and crown glass; but in September, 1828, it\r\n    was directed exclusively to the preparation and perfection of\r\n    peculiar heavy and fusible glasses, from which time continued\r\n    progress has been made.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the experiments on glass-making were stopped.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the Committee for the Improvement of Glass for Optical\r\nPurposes reported to the Royal Society Council that the telescope made\r\nwith Mr. Faraday’s glass had been examined by Captain Kater and Mr.\r\nPond. “It bears as great a power as can reasonably be expected, and is\r\nvery achromatic. The Committee therefore recommend that Mr. Faraday be\r\nrequested to make a perfect piece of glass of the largest size that\r\nhis present apparatus will admit, and also to teach some person to\r\nmanufacture the glass for general sale.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLASS-MAKING LAID ASIDE.]\r\n\r\nIn answer to this Faraday sent the following letter to Dr. Roget, Sec.\r\nR.S.:--\r\n\r\n    [_M. Faraday to P. M. Roget._]\r\n\r\n                              Royal Institution, July 4, 1831.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,--I send you herewith four large and two small\r\n    manuscript volumes relating to optical glass, and comprising\r\n    the journal book and sub-committee book, since the period that\r\n    experimental investigations commenced at the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n    With reference to the request which the Council of the\r\n    Royal Society have done me the honour of making--namely,\r\n    that I should continue the investigation--I should, under\r\n    circumstances of perfect freedom, assent to it at once; but\r\n    obliged as I have been to devote the whole of my spare time\r\n    to the experiments already described, and consequently to\r\n    resign the pursuit of such philosophical inquiries as suggested\r\n    themselves to my own mind, I would wish, under the present\r\n    circumstances, to lay the glass aside for a while, that I may\r\n    enjoy the pleasure of working out my own thoughts on other\r\n    subjects.\r\n\r\n    If at a future time the investigation should be renewed, I must\r\n    beg it to be clearly understood I cannot promise full success\r\n    should I resume it: all that industry and my abilities can\r\n    effect shall be done; but to perfect a manufacture, not being a\r\n    manufacturer, is what I am not bold enough to promise.\r\n\r\n                                        I am, &c.,\r\n                                              M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe optical glass was a failure, so far as concerned the original hope\r\nthat it would lead to great improvements in telescopes. Nevertheless\r\nit furnished scientific men with a new material, the “heavy glass”\r\nconsisting essentially of boro-silicate of lead, for which sundry uses\r\nin spectroscopy and other optical instruments have since been found.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Faraday added this note:--\r\n\r\n    I consider our results as negative, except as regards any\r\n    good that may have resulted from my heavy glass in the hands\r\n    of Amici (who applied it to microscopes) and in my late\r\n    experiments on light.\r\n\r\nThese were the famous experiments on magneto-optics and diamagnetism.\r\nIncidentally the research had led also to the permanent engagement of\r\nSergeant Anderson as assistant to Faraday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESEARCHES AND LECTURES.]\r\n\r\nDuring these years, from 1825 to 1829, which had been thus occupied in\r\nan apparently fruitless quest, he had been far from idle. He had gone\r\non contributing chemical papers to the _Philosophical Transactions_\r\nand to the _Quarterly Journal_. These dealt with sulpho-naphthalic\r\nacid, with the limits of vaporisation, with caoutchouc, bisulphide\r\nof copper, the fluidity of sulphur and phosphorus, the diffusion of\r\ngases, and the relation of water to hot polished surfaces. He had also\r\noriginated at the Royal Institution the Friday evening discourses (see\r\np. 33), the first of which he held in 1826. For some years he himself\r\ndelivered no inconsiderable portion of these discourses every session.\r\nIn 1826 he gave six, in 1827 three, in 1828 five, in 1829 six, and\r\nthese in addition to his regular afternoon courses of six or eight\r\nlectures on some connected subject. He had also, in 1826, begun the\r\nChristmas lectures adapted to a juvenile audience, and had in 1827\r\ngiven a course of twelve lectures at the London Institution in Finsbury\r\nCircus. In addition to these labours he had, in 1827, brought out the\r\nfirst edition of his book on “Chemical Manipulation.” In 1829 he began\r\nhis lectures at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, which continued\r\ntill 1849.\r\n\r\nThe year 1830 may be regarded as the close of the first period of\r\nFaraday’s researches, during which time, though much of his labour\r\nhad been of a preparatory and even desultory kind, it had been a\r\ntraining for the higher work to come. He had made three notable\r\ndiscoveries in chemistry, the new substances benzol and butylene, and\r\nthe solubility of naphthalene in sulphuric acid forming the first of a\r\nnew class of bodies, the sulpho-acids. He had also made an important\r\ndiscovery in physics, that of the electromagnetic rotations. He had\r\nalready published sixty original papers, besides many notes of lesser\r\nimportance, nine of these papers being memoirs in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_. He had already begun to receive from learned societies,\r\nacademies, and universities the recognition of his scientific\r\nattainments, and he had established firmly both his own reputation as\r\na lecturer, and the reputation of the Royal Institution, which was the\r\nscene of his lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES: SECOND PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the year 1831 begins the period of the celebrated “Experimental\r\nResearches in Electricity and Magnetism.” During the years which had\r\nelapsed since his discovery of the electromagnetic rotations in 1823,\r\nFaraday, though occupied, as we have seen, with other matters, had\r\nnot ceased to ponder the relation between the magnet and the electric\r\ncurrent. The great discoveries of Oersted, Ampère, and Arago had\r\nculminated in England in two results: in Faraday’s discovery that the\r\nwire which carries an electric current tends to revolve around the pole\r\nof a neighbouring magnet; and in Sturgeon’s invention of the soft-iron\r\nelectromagnet, a core of iron surrounded by a coil of copper wire,\r\ncapable of acting as a magnet at will when the electric current is\r\ntransmitted to the coil and so caused to circulate around the iron core.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORESHADOWINGS.]\r\n\r\nThis production of magnetism from electricity, at will, and at a\r\ndistance, by the simple device of sending the electricity to circulate\r\nas a current around the central core of iron was then, as now, a cause\r\nof much speculation. The iron core which is to be made temporarily\r\ninto a magnet stands alone, isolated. Though surrounded outwardly\r\nby the magnetising coil of copper wire, it does not touch it; nay,\r\nmust be screened from contact with it by appropriate insulation. The\r\nelectric current entering the copper coil at one end is confined from\r\nleaving the copper wire by any lateral path: it must circulate around\r\neach and every convolution, nor be permitted to flow back by the\r\nreturn-wire until it has performed the required amount of circulation.\r\nThat the mere external circulation of electric current around a totally\r\ndisconnected interior core of iron should magnetise that core; that\r\nthe magnetisation should be maintained so long as the circulation of\r\nelectricity is maintained; and that the magnetising forces should cease\r\nso soon as the current is stopped, are facts, familiar enough to every\r\nbeginner in the science, but mysterious enough from the abstract point\r\nof view. Faraday was firmly persuaded that, great as had been these\r\ndiscoveries of the production of magnetism and magnetic motions from\r\nelectricity, there remained other relations of no less importance to\r\nbe discovered. Again and again his mind recurred to the subject. If it\r\nwere possible to use electricity to produce magnetism, why should not\r\nthe converse be true? In 1822 his notebook suggestion was, as we have\r\nseen, “Convert magnetism into electricity.” Yes, but how?\r\n\r\nHe possessed an intuitive bent of mind to inquire about the relations\r\nof facts to one another. Convinced by sheer converse with nature in\r\nthe laboratory, of the correlation of forces and of the conservation\r\nof energy long before either of those doctrines had received distinct\r\nenunciation as principles of natural philosophy, he seems never to\r\nhave viewed an action without thinking of the necessary and appropriate\r\nreaction; never to have deemed any physical relation complete in\r\nwhich discovery had not been made of the converse relations for\r\nwhich instinctively he sought. So in December, 1824, we find him\r\nexperimenting on the passage of a bar magnet through a helix of copper\r\nwire (see _Quarterly Journal_ for July, 1825), but without result. In\r\nNovember, 1825, he sought for evidence that might prove an electric\r\ncurrent in a wire to exercise an influence upon a neighbouring wire\r\nconnected to a galvanometer. But again, and yet again in December\r\nof the same year, the entry stands “No result.” A third failure did\r\nnot convince him that the search was hopeless: it showed him that he\r\nhad not yet found the right method of experimenting. It is narrated\r\nof him how at this period he used to carry in his waistcoat pocket a\r\nsmall model of an electromagnetic circuit--a straight iron core about\r\nan inch long, surrounded by a few spiral turns of copper wire--which\r\nmodel he at spare moments would take out and contemplate, using it thus\r\nobjectively to concentrate his thoughts upon the problem to be solved.\r\nA copper coil, an iron core. Given that electricity was flowing through\r\nthe one, it evoked magnetism in the other. What was the converse?\r\nAt first sight it might seem simple enough. Put magnetism from some\r\nexternal source into the iron core, and then try whether on connecting\r\nthe copper coil to a galvanometer there was any indication of an\r\nelectric current. But this was exactly what was found not to result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OTHER MEN’S FAILURES.]\r\n\r\nAnd not Faraday alone, but others, too, were foiled in the hope of\r\nobserving the expected converse. Not all who tried were as wise or\r\nas frank as Faraday in confessing failure. Fresnel, in the height of\r\nthe fever of Oersted’s discovery, had announced to the Academy of\r\nSciences at Paris, on the 6th of November, 1820, that he had decomposed\r\nwater by means of a magnet which was laid motionless within a spiral\r\nof wire. Emboldened by this announcement, Ampère remarked that he\r\ntoo had noticed something in the way of production of currents from\r\na magnet. But before the end of the year both these statements were\r\nwithdrawn by their authors. Again, in the year 1822, Ampère, being at\r\nGeneva, showed to Professor A. de la Rive in his laboratory a number of\r\nelectromagnetic experiments from his classical researches; and amongst\r\nthem one[20] which has been almost forgotten, but which, had it been\r\nfollowed up, would assuredly have led Ampère to the discovery of the\r\ninduction of currents. In the experiment in question a thin copper\r\nring, made of a narrow strip folded into a circle, was hung inside\r\na circular coil of wire, traversed by a current. To this apparatus\r\na powerful horse-shoe magnet was presented; and De la Rive states\r\nthat, when the magnet was brought up, the suspended ring was observed\r\nsometimes to move between the two limbs of the magnet, and sometimes\r\nto be repelled from between them according to the sense of the current\r\nin the surrounding coil. He and Ampère both attributed the effect to\r\ntemporary magnetism conferred upon the copper ring. Ampère himself\r\nwas at the time disposed to attribute it to the possible presence of\r\na little iron as an impurity in the copper. There are, however, some\r\ndiscrepancies in the three published versions of the story. According\r\nto Becquerel, Ampère had by 1825 satisfied himself of the non-existence\r\nof induction currents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A PUZZLING EXPERIMENT.]\r\n\r\nQuite independently, the question of the possibility of creating\r\ncurrents by magnets was raised by another discovery, that of the\r\nso-called “magnetism of rotation.” In 1824 Arago had observed that\r\na fine magnetic compass constructed for him by Gambey, having the\r\nneedle suspended in a cell, the base of which was a plate of pure\r\ncopper, was thereby damped in its oscillations, and instead of making\r\ntwo or three hundred vibrations before it came to rest, as would be\r\nthe case in the open air, executed only three or four of rapidly\r\ndecreasing amplitude.[21] In vain did Dumas at the request of Arago\r\nanalyse the copper, in the supposition that iron might be present.\r\nInquiry compelled the conclusion that some other explanation must be\r\nsought. And, reasoning from the apparent action of stationary copper\r\nin bringing a moving magnetic needle to rest, he conjectured that a\r\nmoving mass of copper might produce motion in a stationary magnetic\r\nneedle. Accordingly he set into revolution, beneath a compass needle,\r\na flat disc of copper, and found that, even when a sheet of card or\r\nglass was interposed to cut off all air-currents, the needle tended to\r\nfollow the moving copper disc, turning as if dragged by some invisible\r\ninfluence. To the suggestion that mere rotation conferred upon copper\r\na sort of temporary magnetism Arago listened with some impatience. All\r\ntheories proposed to account for the phenomenon he discredited, even\r\nthough emanating from the great mathematician Poisson. He held his\r\njudgment in absolute suspense. Babbage and Herschel measured the amount\r\nof retarding force exerted on the needle by different materials, and\r\nfound the most effective to be silver and copper (which are the two\r\nbest conductors of electricity), after them gold and zinc, whilst lead,\r\nmercury, and bismuth were inferior in power. The next year the same\r\nexperimenters announced the successful inversion of Arago’s experiment;\r\nfor by spinning the magnet underneath a pivoted copper disc they caused\r\nthe latter to rotate briskly. They also made the notable observation\r\nthat if slits are cut radially in the copper disc they diminish its\r\ntendency to be dragged by the spinning magnet. Sturgeon showed that\r\nthe damping effect of a moving copper disc was diminished by the\r\npresence of a second magnet pole of contrary kind placed beside the\r\nfirst. All these things were most suggestive of the real explanation.\r\nIt clearly had something to do with the electric conductivity of\r\nthe metal disc, and therefore with electric currents. Sturgeon five\r\nyears later came very near to the explanation: after repeating the\r\nexperiments he concluded that the effect was an electric disturbance\r\nin the copper disc, “a kind of reaction to that which takes place in\r\nelectromagnetism.”\r\n\r\nFaraday knew of all the discussions which had arisen respecting\r\nArago’s rotations. They may have been the cause of his unsuccessful\r\nattempts of 1824 and 1825. In April, 1828, for the fourth time he tried\r\nto discover the currents which he was convinced must be producible\r\nby the magnet, and for the fourth time without result. The cause of\r\nfailure was that both magnet and coil were at rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1831 witnessed him for the fifth time making the attack\r\non the problem thus persistently before him. In his laboratory\r\nnote-book he heads the research “Experiments on the production of\r\nelectricity from magnetism.” The following excellent summary of the\r\nlaboratory notes is taken from Bence Jones’s “Life and Letters”:--\r\n\r\n    I have had an iron ring made (soft iron), iron round and ⅞ths\r\n    of an inch thick, and ring six inches in external diameter.\r\n    Wound many coils of copper round, one half of the coils being\r\n    separated by twine and calico; there were three lengths of\r\n    wire, each about twenty-four feet long, and they could be\r\n    connected as one length, or used as separate lengths. By trials\r\n    with a trough each was insulated from the other. Will call\r\n    this side of the ring A. On the other side, but separated by\r\n    an interval, was wound wire in two pieces, together amounting\r\n    to about sixty feet in length, the direction being as with the\r\n    former coils. This side call B.[22]\r\n\r\n    Charged a battery of ten pairs of plates four inches square.\r\n    Made the coil on B side one coil, and connected its extremities\r\n    by a copper wire passing to a distance, and just over a\r\n    magnetic needle (three feet from wire ring), then connected the\r\n    ends of one of the pieces on A side with battery: immediately\r\n    a sensible effect on needle. It oscillated and settled at last\r\n    in original position. On breaking connection of A side with\r\n    battery, again a disturbance of the needle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUCCESS IN SIGHT.]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth paragraph, written on the 30th of August, he says,\r\n“May not these transient effects be connected with causes of difference\r\nbetween power of metals at rest and in motion in Arago’s experiments?”\r\nAfter this he prepared fresh apparatus.\r\n\r\nAs was his manner, he wrote off to one of his friends a letter telling\r\nwhat he was at work upon. On this occasion the recipient of his\r\nconfidences was his friend Phillips:--\r\n\r\n    [_Michael Faraday to Richard Phillips._]\r\n\r\n                                        Royal Institution.\r\n                                                Sept. 23, 1831.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\n    I write now, though it may be some time before I send my\r\n    letter, but that is of no great consequence. I received your\r\n    letter to Dr. Reid and read it on the coach going to Hastings,\r\n    where I have been passing a few weeks, and I fancy my fellow\r\n    passengers thought I had got something very droll in hand;\r\n    they sometimes started at my sudden bursts, especially when I\r\n    had the moment before been very grave and serious amongst the\r\n    proportions. As you say in the letter there are some new facts\r\n    and they are always of value; otherwise I should have thought\r\n    you had taken more trouble than the matter deserved. Your\r\n    quotation from Boyle has nevertheless great force in it.\r\n\r\n    I shall send with this a little thing in your own way “On the\r\n    Alleged decline of science in England.” It is written by Dr.\r\n    Moll of Utrecht, whose name may be mentioned in conversation\r\n    though it is not printed in the pamphlet. I understand the\r\n    view taken by Moll is not at all agreeable to some. “I do not\r\n    know what business Moll had to interfere with our scientific\r\n    disputes” is however the strongest observation I have heard of\r\n    in reply.\r\n\r\n    I do not think I thanked you for your last Pharmacopœia. I\r\n    do so now very heartily. I shall detain this letter a few\r\n    days that I may send a couple of my papers (_i.e._ a paper\r\n    and appendix) with it, for though not chemical I think\r\n    you will like to have them. I am busy just now again on\r\n    Electro-Magnetism, and think I have got hold of a good thing,\r\n    but can’t say; it may be a weed instead of a fish that after\r\n    all my labour I may at last pull up. I think I know why metals\r\n    are magnetic when in motion though not (generally) when at rest.\r\n\r\n    We think about you all very much at times, and talk over\r\n    affairs of Nelson Square, but I think we dwell more upon the\r\n    illnesses and nursings and upon the sudden calls and chats\r\n    rather than the regular parties. Pray remember us both to Mrs.\r\n    Phillips and the damsils--I hope the word is not too familiar.\r\n\r\n                                        I am Dear Phillips,\r\n                                              Most Truly Yours,\r\n                                                        M.

He began (paragraph\r\n21) by trying to find the effect of one helix of wire, carrying the\r\nvoltaic current of ten pairs of plates, upon another wire connected\r\nwith a galvanometer. “No induction sensible.” Longer and different\r\nmetallic helices (paragraph 22) showed no effect; so he gave up those\r\nexperiments for that day, and tried the effects of bar magnets instead\r\nof the ring magnet he had used on the first day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nIn paragraph 33 he says:--\r\n\r\n    An iron cylinder had a helix wound on it. The ends of the wires\r\n    of the helix were connected with the indicating helix at a\r\n    distance by copper wire. Then the iron placed between the poles\r\n    of bar magnets as in accompanying figure (Fig. 5). Every time\r\n    the magnetic contact at N or S was made or broken, there was\r\n    magnetic motion at the indicating helix--the effect being, as\r\n    in former cases, not permanent, but a mere momentary push or\r\n    pull. But if the electric communication (_i.e_. by the copper\r\n    wire) was broken, then the disjunction and contacts produced no\r\n    effect whatever. Hence here distinct conversion of magnetism\r\n    into electricity.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day of work was October 1. Paragraphs 36, 37, and 38\r\ndescribe the discovery of induced voltaic currents:--\r\n\r\n    36. A battery of ten troughs, each of ten pairs of plates four\r\n    inches square, charged with good mixture of sulphuric and\r\n    nitric acid, and the following experiments made with it in the\r\n    following order.\r\n\r\n    37. One of the coils (of a helix of copper wire 203 feet long)\r\n    was connected with the flat helix, and the other (coil of same\r\n    length round same block of wood) with the poles of the battery\r\n    (it having been found that there was no metallic contact\r\n    between the two); the magnetic needle at the indicating flat\r\n    helix was affected, but so little as to be hardly sensible.\r\n\r\n    38. In place of the indicating helix, our galvanometer was\r\n    used, and then a sudden jerk was perceived when the battery\r\n    communication was _made_ and _broken_, but it was so slight as\r\n    to be scarcely visible. It was one way when made, the other\r\n    when broken, and the needle took up its natural position at\r\n    intermediate times.\r\n\r\n    Hence there is an inducing effect without the presence of iron,\r\n    but it is either very weak or else so sudden as not to have\r\n    time to move the needle. I rather suspect it is the latter.\r\n\r\nThe fifth day of experiment was October 17. Paragraph 57 describes the\r\ndiscovery of the production of electricity by the approximation of a\r\nmagnet to a wire:--\r\n\r\n    A cylindrical bar magnet three-quarters of an inch in\r\n    diameter, and eight inches and a half in length, had one end\r\n    just inserted into the end of the helix cylinder (220 feet\r\n    long); then it was quickly thrust in the whole length, and the\r\n    _galvanometer_ needle moved; then pulled out, and again the\r\n    _needle moved_, but in the opposite direction. This effect was\r\n    repeated every time the magnet was put in or out, and therefore\r\n    a wave of electricity was so produced from _mere approximation\r\n    of a magnet_, and not from its formation _in situ_.\r\n\r\nThe cause of all the earlier failures was, then, that both magnet and\r\ncoil were at rest. The magnet might lie in or near the coil for a\r\ncentury and cause no effect. But while moving towards the coil, or from\r\nit, or by spinning near it, electric currents were at once induced.\r\n\r\nThe ninth day of his experiments was October 28, and this day\r\nhe “made a copper disc turn round between the poles of the great\r\nhorse-shoe magnet of the Royal Society. The axis and edge of the disc\r\nwere connected with a galvanometer. The needle moved as the disc\r\nturned.” The next day that he made experiments, November 4, he found\r\n“that a copper wire one-eighth of an inch drawn between the poles and\r\nconductors produced the effect.” In his paper, when describing the\r\nexperiment, he speaks of the metal “cutting” the magnetic curves, and\r\nin a note to his paper he says, “By magnetic curves I mean lines of\r\nmagnetic forces which would be depicted by iron filings.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUCCESS AND ITS SECRET.]\r\n\r\nWe here come upon those “lines of force” which played so important a\r\npart in these and many of Faraday’s later investigations. They were\r\nknown before Faraday’s time--had, in fact, been known for two hundred\r\nyears. Descartes had seen in them evidence for his hypothetical\r\nvortices. Musschenbroek had mapped them. But it was reserved to Faraday\r\nto point out their true significance. To the very end of his life he\r\ncontinued to speculate and experiment upon them.\r\n\r\nAll this splendid work had occupied but a brief ten days. Then he\r\nrearranged the facts which he had thus harvested, and wrote them out in\r\ncorrected form as the first series of his “Experimental Researches in\r\nElectricity.” The memoir was read to the Royal Society on November 24,\r\n1831, though it did not appear in printed form until January, 1832--a\r\ndelay which gave rise to serious misunderstandings. The paper having\r\nbeen read, he went away to Brighton to take a holiday, and in the\r\nexuberance of his heart penned the following letter[23] to Phillips:--\r\n\r\n    [_M. Faraday to R. Phillips._]\r\n\r\n                                        Brighton: November 29, 1831.\r\n\r\n    DEAR PHILLIPS,--For once in my life I am able to sit down and\r\n    write to you without feeling that my time is so little that my\r\n    letter must of necessity be a short one and accordingly I have\r\n    taken an extra large sheet of paper intending to fill it with\r\n    news and yet as to news I have none for I withdraw more and\r\n    more from Society, and all I have to say is about myself.\r\n\r\n    But how are you getting on? are you comfortable? and how does\r\n    Mrs. Phillips do; and the girls? Bad correspondant as I am, I\r\n    think you owe me a letter and as in the course of half an hour\r\n    you will be doubly in my debt pray write us, and let us know\r\n    all about you. Mrs. Faraday wishes me not to forget to put her\r\n    kind remembrances to you and Mrs. Phillips in my letter.\r\n\r\n    To-morrow is St. Andrew’s day,[24] but we shall be here until\r\n    Thursday. I have made arrangements to be _out_ of the Council\r\n    and care little for the rest although I should as a matter of\r\n    curiosity have liked to see the Duke in the chair on such an\r\n    occasion.\r\n\r\n    We are here to refresh. I have been working and writing a\r\n    paper and that always knocks me up in health, but now I feel\r\n    well again and able to pursue my subject and now I will tell\r\n    you what it is about. The title will be, I think, EXPERIMENTAL\r\n    RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY: §I. _On the induction of electric\r\n    currents._ § II. _On the evolution of Electricity from\r\n    magnetism._ § III. _On a New electrical condition of matter._\r\n    § IV. _On Arago’s magnetic phenomena._ There is a bill of fare\r\n    for you; and what is more I hope it will not disappoint you.\r\n    Now the pith of all this I must give you very briefly; the\r\n    demonstrations you shall have in the paper when printed--\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE PITH OF THE DISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\n    § I. When an electric current is passed through one of two\r\n    parallel wires it causes at first a current in the same\r\n    direction[25] through the other, but this induced current does\r\n    not last a moment, notwithstanding the inducing current (from\r\n    the Voltaic battery) is continued all seems unchanged except\r\n    that the principal current continues its course, but when the\r\n    current is stopped then a return current occurs in the wire\r\n    under induction of about the same intensity and momentary\r\n    duration but in the opposite direction to that first found.\r\n    Electricity in currents therefore exerts an inductive action\r\n    like ordinary electricity but subject to peculiar laws: the\r\n    effects are a current in the same direction when the induction\r\n    is established: a reverse current when the induction ceases and\r\n    a _peculiar state_ in the interim. Common electricity probably\r\n    does the same thing but as it is at present impossible to\r\n    separate the beginning and the end of a spark or discharge from\r\n    each other, all the effects are simultaneous and neutralise\r\n    each other--\r\n\r\n    § II. Then I found that magnets would induce just like voltaic\r\n    currents and by bringing helices and wires and jackets up to\r\n    the poles of magnets, electrical currents were produced in\r\n    them these currents being able to deflect the galvanometer, or\r\n    to make, by means of the helix, magnetic needles, or in one\r\n    case even to give a spark. Hence the evolution of _electricity\r\n    from magnetism_. The currents were not permanent, they ceased\r\n    the moment the wires ceased to approach the magnet because\r\n    the new and apparently quiescent state was assumed just as in\r\n    the case of the induction of currents. But when the magnet\r\n    was removed, and its induction therefore ceased, the return\r\n    currents appeared as before. These two kinds of induction\r\n    I have distinguished by the terms _Volta-electric_ and\r\n    _Magneto-electric_ induction. Their identity of action and\r\n    results is, I think, a very powerful proof of the truth of M.\r\n    Ampère’s theory of magnetism.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: A JUBILANT EPISTLE.]\r\n\r\n    § III. The new electrical condition which intervenes by\r\n    induction between the beginning and end of the inducing current\r\n    gives rise to some very curious results. It explains why\r\n    chemical action or other results of electricity have never\r\n    been as yet obtained in trials with the magnet. In fact, the\r\n    currents have no sensible duration. I believe it will explain\r\n    perfectly the _transference of elements_ between the poles\r\n    of the pile in decomposition but this part of the subject I\r\n    have reserved until the present experiments are completed\r\n    and it is so analogous, in some of its effects to those of\r\n    Ritter’s secondary piles, De la Rive and Van Beck’s peculiar\r\n    properties of the poles of a voltaic pile, that I should\r\n    not wonder if they all proved ultimately to depend on this\r\n    state. The condition of matter I have dignified by the term\r\n    _Electrotonic_, THE ELECTROTONIC STATE. What do you think of\r\n    that? Am I not a bold man, ignorant as I am, to coin words\r\n    but I have consulted the scholars,[26] and now for § IV. The\r\n    new state has enabled me to make out and explain all Arago’s\r\n    phenomena of the rotating magnet or copper plate, I believe,\r\n    perfectly; but as great names are concerned Arago, Babbage,\r\n    Herschel, &c., and as I have to differ from them, I have spoken\r\n    with that modesty which you so well know you and I and John\r\n    Frost[27] have in common, and for which the world so justly\r\n    commends us. I am even half afraid to tell you what it is.\r\n    You will think I am hoaxing you, or else in your compassion\r\n    you may conclude I am deceiving myself. However, you need do\r\n    neither, but had better laugh, as I did most heartily when I\r\n    found that it was neither attraction nor repulsion, but just\r\n    one of _my old rotations_ in a new form. I cannot explain to\r\n    you all the actions, which are very curious; but in consequence\r\n    of the electrotonic state being assumed and lost as the\r\n    parts of the plate whirl under the pole, and in consequence\r\n    of magneto-electric induction, currents of electricity are\r\n    formed in the direction of the radii; continuing, for simple\r\n    reasons, as long as the motion continues, but ceasing when\r\n    that ceases. Hence the wonder is explained that the metal has\r\n    powers on the magnet when moving, but not when at rest. Hence\r\n    is also explained the effect which Arago observed, and which\r\n    made him contradict Babbage and Herschel, and say the power\r\n    was repulsive; but, as a whole, it is really tangential. It\r\n    is quite comfortable to me to find that experiment need not\r\n    quail before mathematics, but is quite competent to rival\r\n    it in discovery; and I am amused to find that what the high\r\n    mathematicians have announced as the _essential condition_\r\n    to the rotation--namely, that _time is required_--has so\r\n    little foundation, that if the time could by possibility be\r\n    anticipated instead of being required--_i.e._ if the currents\r\n    could be formed _before_ the magnet came over the place instead\r\n    of _after_--the effect would equally ensue. Adieu, dear\r\n    Phillips.\r\n\r\n    Excuse this egotistical letter from yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second section shows that Faraday had discovered the cause of all\r\nthe previous failures to evoke electric currents in wires by means of a\r\nmagnet: it required _relative motion_. What the magnet at rest fails to\r\ndo, the magnet in motion accomplishes. This crucial point is admirably\r\ncommemorated in the following impromptu given by Mr. Herbert Mayo to\r\nSir Charles Wheatstone:--\r\n\r\n  Around the magnet Faraday\r\n  Was sure that Volta’s lightnings play:\r\n      But how to draw them from the wire?\r\n  He took a lesson from the heart:\r\n  ’Tis when we meet, ’tis when we part,\r\n      Breaks forth the electric fire.\r\n\r\nFaraday’s holiday was brief; by December 5 he was again at work on his\r\nresearches. He re-observed the directions of the induced currents about\r\nwhich, as the slip in his letter to Phillips shows, his mind was in\r\nsome doubt. Then on December 14th comes the entry:--“Tried the effects\r\nof terrestrial magnetism in evolving electricity. Obtained beautiful\r\nresults.”\r\n\r\n“The helix had the soft iron cylinder (freed from magnetism by a full\r\nred heat and cooling slowly) put into it, and it was then connected\r\nwith the galvanometer by wires eight foot long; then inverted the bar\r\nand helix, and immediately the needle moved; inverted it again, the\r\nneedle moved back; and, by repeating the motion with the oscillations\r\nof the needle, made the latter vibrate 180°, or more.”\r\n\r\nThe same day he “made Arago’s experiment with the earth magnet, only no\r\nmagnet used, but the plate put horizontal and rotated. The effect at\r\nthe needle was slight but very distinct.... Hence Arago’s plate a new\r\nelectrical machine.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POINTS IN THE DISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\nWhen we compare these manuscript notes, recording the experiments in\r\nthe order in which they were made with the published account of them\r\nin the “Experimental Researches,” we find many of them transcribed\r\nalmost verbatim. But there is a difference in the order of their\r\narrangement. In point of time the experiments on the evolution of\r\nelectricity from magnetism, beginning with the ring (p. 108), preceded\r\nthose on the induction of a current by another current. In the printed\r\n“Researches” the experiments on the induction of currents are put\r\nfirst, with an introductory paragraph on the general phenomenon of\r\ninduction.[28] Faraday’s habit of working up an experiment--whether\r\nsuccessful or unsuccessful--by increasing the power to the maximum\r\navailable is illustrated in the course of the experiments on the iron\r\nring. At first he used a battery of ten pairs of plates four inches\r\nsquare. Then, having been eminently successful in producing deflexions\r\nof his galvanometer, he increased the battery to one hundred pairs of\r\nplates, with the result that when contact was completed or broken in\r\nthe primary circuit the impulse on the galvanometer in the secondary\r\ncircuit was so great as to make the needle spin round rapidly four\r\nor five times before its motion was reduced to a mere oscillation.\r\nThen he removed the galvanometer and fixed small pencils of charcoal\r\nto the ends of the secondary helix; and to his great joy perceived a\r\nminute _spark_ between the lightly touching charcoal points whenever\r\nthe contact of the battery to the primary helix was completed. This\r\nwas the first transformer, for the first time set--on a small\r\nscale--to produce a tiny electric light. The spark he regarded as a\r\nprecious indication that what he was producing really was an electric\r\ncurrent. Using the great compound steel magnet of the Royal Society\r\n(constructed by Dr. Gowin Knight) at Christie’s house at Woolwich\r\nhe had, as narrated above, also obtained a spark from the induced\r\ncurrent. For some time he failed to obtain either physiological or\r\nchemical effects. But upon repeating the experiments more at leisure\r\nat the Royal Institution, with Daniell’s armed loadstone capable of\r\nlifting thirty pounds, a frog was found to be convulsed very strongly\r\neach time magnetic contact between the magnet and the iron core of the\r\nexperimental coil was made or broken.\r\n\r\nThe absence of evidence as to chemical action seemed still to\r\ndisquiet him. He wanted to be sure that his induced currents would\r\ndo everything that ordinary voltaic currents would do. Failing the\r\nfinal proof from chemical action, he rested the case on the other\r\nidentical properties. “But an agent,” he says, “which is conducted\r\nalong metallic wires in the manner described; which, whilst so passing,\r\npossesses the peculiar magnetic actions and force of a current of\r\nelectricity; which can agitate and convulse the limbs of a frog;\r\nand which, finally, can produce a spark by its discharge through\r\ncharcoal, can only be electricity. As all the effects can be produced\r\nby ferruginous electro-magnets, there is no doubt that arrangements\r\nlike the magnets of Professors Moll, Henry, Ten Eyke, and others, in\r\nwhich as many as two thousand pounds have been lifted, may be used\r\nfor these experiments; in which case not only a brighter spark may be\r\nobtained, but wires also ignited, and as the currents can pass liquids,\r\nchemical action be produced. These effects are still more likely to\r\nbe obtained when the magneto-electric arrangements, to be explained\r\nin the fourth section, are excited by the powers of such apparatus.”\r\nThe apparatus described in the fourth section comprised several forms\r\nof magneto-electric machines, that is to say, primitive kinds of\r\ndynamos. Having in his mind the phenomenon discovered by Arago, and\r\nthe experiments of Babbage and Herschel on the so-called magnetism of\r\nrotation, he followed up the idea that these effects might be due to\r\ninduced currents eddying round in the copper disc. No sooner had he\r\nobtained electricity from magnets than he attempted to make Arago’s\r\nexperiment a new source of electricity, and, as he himself says, “did\r\nnot despair” “of being able to construct a new electrical machine.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. (FACSIMILE OF ORIGINAL SKETCH.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A NEW ELECTRICAL MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe “new electrical machine” was an exceedingly simple contrivance. A\r\ndisc of copper, twelve inches in diameter (Fig. 6), and about one-fifth\r\nof an inch in thickness, fixed upon a brass axle, was mounted in\r\nframes, so as to allow of revolution, its edge being at the same time\r\nintroduced between the magnetic poles of a large compound permanent\r\nmagnet, the poles being about half an inch apart.[29] The magnet first\r\nused was the historical magnet of Gowin Knight. The edge of the plate\r\nwas well amalgamated, for the purpose of obtaining a good but movable\r\ncontact, and a part round the axle was also prepared in a similar\r\nmanner. Conducting strips of copper and lead, to serve as electric\r\ncollectors, were prepared, so as to be placed in contact with the edge\r\nof the copper disc; one of these was held by hand to touch the edge\r\nof the disc between the magnet poles. The wires from a galvanometer\r\nwere connected, the one to the collecting-strip, the other to the\r\nbrass axle; then on revolving the disc a deflexion of the galvanometer\r\nwas obtained, which was reversed in direction when the direction of\r\nthe rotation was reversed. “Here, therefore, was demonstrated the\r\nproduction of a permanent current of electricity by ordinary magnets.”\r\nThese effects were also obtained from the poles of electro-magnets,\r\nand from copper helices without iron cores. Several other forms of\r\nmagneto-electric machines were tried by Faraday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEW FORMS OF APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nIn one,[30] a flat ring of twelve inches’ external diameter, and one\r\ninch broad, was cut from a thick copper plate, and mounted to revolve\r\nbetween the poles of the magnet, two conductors being applied to\r\nmake rubbing contact at the inner and outer edge at the part which\r\npassed between the magnetic poles. In another,[31] a disc of copper,\r\none-fifth of an inch thick and only 1½ inch in diameter (Fig. 7), was\r\namalgamated at the edge, and mounted on a copper axle. A square piece\r\nof sheet metal had a circular hole cut in it, into which the disc\r\nfitted loosely; a little mercury completed communication between the\r\ndisc and its surrounding ring. The latter was connected by wire to a\r\ngalvanometer; the other wire being connected from the instrument to the\r\nend of the axle. Upon rotating the disc in a horizontal plane, currents\r\nwere obtained, though the earth was the only magnet employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nFaraday also proposed a multiple machine[32] having several discs,\r\nmetallically connected alternately at the edges and centres by means\r\nof mercury, which were then to be revolved alternately in opposite\r\ndirections, In another apparatus,[33] a copper cylinder (Fig. 8),\r\nclosed at one extremity, was put over a magnet, one half of which\r\nit enclosed like a cap, and to which it was attached without making\r\nmetallic contact. The arrangement was then floated upright in a narrow\r\njar of mercury, so that the lower edge of the copper cap touched the\r\nfluid. On rotating the magnet and its attached cap, a current was sent\r\nthrough wires from the mercury to the top of the copper cap. In another\r\napparatus,[34] still preserved at the Royal Institution, a cylindrical\r\nbar magnet, half immersed in mercury, was made to rotate, and generated\r\na current, its own metal serving as a conductor. In another form,[35]\r\nthe cylindrical magnet was rotated horizontally about its own axis, and\r\nwas found to generate currents which flowed from the middle to the\r\nends, or _vice versâ_, according to the rotation. The description of\r\nthese new electrical machines is concluded with the following pregnant\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN EARTH-INDUCTOR.]\r\n\r\n    I have rather, however, been desirous of discovering new facts\r\n    and relations dependent on magneto-electric induction, than of\r\n    exalting the force of those already obtained; being assured\r\n    that the latter would find their full development hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nIn yet another machine (Fig. 9), constructed by Faraday some time\r\nlater,[36] a simple rectangle of copper wire _w_, attached to a frame,\r\nwas rotated about a horizontal axis placed east and west, and generated\r\nalternate currents, which could be collected by a simple commutator _c_.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months machines on the principle of magneto-induction had\r\nbeen devised by Dal Negro, and by Pixii. In the latter’s apparatus a\r\nsteel horseshoe magnet, with its poles upwards, was caused to rotate\r\nabout a vertical shaft, inducing alternating currents in a pair of\r\nbobbins fixed above it, and provided with a horseshoe core of soft\r\niron. Later, in 1832, Pixii produced, at the suggestion of Ampère,[37]\r\na second machine, provided with mercury cup connections to rectify the\r\nalternations of the current. One of these machines was shown at the\r\nBritish Association meeting at Oxford in the same year (p. 64).\r\n\r\nThe idea developed in the third part of this research was intensely\r\noriginal and suggestive. Faraday’s own statement is as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ELECTROTONIC STATE.]\r\n\r\n    Whilst the wire is subject to either volta-electric or\r\n    magneto-electric induction, it appears to be in a peculiar\r\n    state; for it resists the formation of an electrical current\r\n    in it, whereas, if left in its common condition, such a\r\n    current would be produced; and when left uninfluenced it has\r\n    the power of originating a current, a power which the wire\r\n    does not possess under common circumstances. This electrical\r\n    condition of matter has not hitherto been recognised, but it\r\n    probably exerts a very important influence in many, if not\r\n    most, of the phenomena produced by currents of electricity. For\r\n    reasons which will immediately appear, I have, after advising\r\n    with several learned friends, ventured to designate it as the\r\n    _electrotonic_ state.\r\n\r\n    This peculiar condition shows no known electrical effects\r\n    whilst it continues; nor have I yet been able to discover any\r\n    peculiar powers exerted or properties possessed by matter\r\n    whilst retained in this state.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    This state is altogether the effect of the induction exerted,\r\n    and ceases as soon as the inductive force is removed.... The\r\n    state appears to be instantly assumed, requiring hardly a\r\n    sensible portion of time for that purpose.... In all those\r\n    cases where the helices or wires are advanced towards or taken\r\n    from the magnet, the direct or inverted current of induced\r\n    electricity continues for the time occupied in the advance or\r\n    recession; for the electro-tonic state is rising to a higher or\r\n    falling to a lower degree during that time, and the change is\r\n    accompanied by its corresponding evolution of electricity; but\r\n    these form no objections to the opinion that the electro-tonic\r\n    state is instantly assumed.\r\n\r\n    This peculiar state appears to be a state of tension, and may\r\n    be considered as _equivalent_ to a current of electricity,\r\n    at least equal to that produced either when the condition is\r\n    induced or destroyed.\r\n\r\nFaraday further supposed that the formation of this state in the\r\nneighbourhood of a coil would exert a reaction upon the original\r\ncurrent, giving rise to a retardation of it; but he was unable at\r\nthe time to ascertain experimentally whether this was so. He even\r\nlooked--though also unsuccessfully--for a self-induced return current\r\nfrom a conductor of copper through which a strong current was led and\r\nthen suddenly interrupted, the expected current of reaction being “due\r\nto the discharge of its supposed electrotonic state.”\r\n\r\nIf we would understand the rather obscure language in which this idea\r\nof an electrotonic state is couched, we must try to put ourselves\r\nback to the epoch when it was written. At that date the only ideas\r\nwhich had been formulated to explain magnetic and electric attractions\r\nand repulsions were founded upon the notion of action at a distance.\r\nMichell had propounded the view that the electric and magnetic forces\r\nvary, like gravity, according to a law of the inverse squares of the\r\ndistances. Coulomb, in a series of experiments requiring extraordinary\r\npatience as well as delicacy of manipulation, had shown--by an\r\napplication of Michell’s torsion balance--that in particular cases\r\nwhere the electric charges are concentrated on small spheres, or\r\nwhere the magnetic poles are small, so as to act as mere points,\r\nthis law--which is essentially a geometric law of point-action--is\r\napproximately fulfilled. The mathematicians, Laplace and Poisson at\r\ntheir head, had seized on this demonstration and had elaborated their\r\nmathematical theories. Before them, though the research lay for a\r\ncentury unpublished, Cavendish had shown that the only law of force\r\nas between one element of an electric charge and another compatible\r\nwith a charge being in equilibrium was the law of inverse squares.\r\nBut in all these mathematical reasonings one thing had been quite\r\nleft out of sight--namely, the possible properties of the intervening\r\nmedium. Faraday, to whom the idea of mere action at a distance was\r\nabhorrent, if not unthinkable, conceived of all these forces of\r\nattraction and repulsion as effects taking place by something going\r\non _in the intervening medium_, as effects propagated from point\r\nto point continuously through space. In his earlier work on the\r\nelectromagnetic rotations he had grown to regard the space around\r\nthe conducting wire as being affected by the so-called current; and\r\nthe space about the poles of a magnet he knew to be traversed by\r\ncurved magnetic lines, invisible indeed, but real, needing only the\r\nsimplest of expedients--the sprinkling of iron filings--to reveal their\r\nexistence and trend. When therefore he found that these new effects of\r\nthe induction of one electric current by another could likewise cross\r\nan intervening space, whether empty or filled with material bodies,\r\nhe instinctively sought to ascribe this propagation of the effect\r\nto a property or state of the medium. And finding that state to be\r\ndifferent from any state previously known, different from the state\r\nexisting between two magnets at rest or between two stationary electric\r\ncharges, he followed the entirely philosophical course of exploring its\r\nproperties and of denoting it by a name which he deemed appropriate. As\r\nwe shall see, this idea of an electrotonic state recurred in his later\r\nresearches with new and important connotations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nHe was soon at work again, as we have seen.\r\n\r\nHe experimented, in January, 1832, on the currents produced by the\r\nearth’s rotation--on the 10th at the round pond in Kensington Gardens,\r\nand on the 12th and 13th at Waterloo Bridge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SPARK FROM A MAGNET.]\r\n\r\n“This evening,” he writes in his notebook under date February 8, “at\r\nWoolwich, experimenting with magnet,[38] and for the first time got the\r\nmagnetic spark myself. Connected ends of a helix into two general ends,\r\nand then crossed the wires in such a way that a blow at _a b_ would\r\nopen them a little [Fig. 10]. Then bringing _a b_ against the poles of\r\na magnet, the ends were disjoined, and bright sparks resulted.”\r\n\r\nFrom succeeding with a steel magnet it was but a short step to\r\nsucceed when a natural loadstone was used. The next day we find this\r\nentry:--“At home succeeded beautifully with Mr. Daniell’s magnet.\r\nAmalgamation of wires very needful. This is a natural loadstone, and\r\nperhaps the first used for the spark.”\r\n\r\nHe sent to the Royal Society an account of these and the earlier\r\nexperiments; his paper on terrestrial magneto-electric induction, and\r\non the force and direction of magneto-electric induction, received the\r\ndistinction of being read as the Bakerian lecture of the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TYNDALL’S SUMMARY.]\r\n\r\nThe following summary of this second paper is from the pen of Professor\r\nTyndall:--\r\n\r\n    He placed a bar of iron in a coil of wire, and lifting the\r\n    bar into the direction of the dipping needle, he excited by\r\n    this action a current in the coil. On reversing the bar, a\r\n    current in the opposite direction rushed through the wire.\r\n    The same effect was produced, when, on holding the helix in\r\n    the line of dip, a bar of iron was thrust into it. Here,\r\n    however, the earth acted on the coil through the intermediation\r\n    of the bar of iron. He abandoned the bar, and simply set a\r\n    copper plate spinning in a horizontal plane; he knew that the\r\n    earth’s lines of magnetic force then crossed the plate at an\r\n    angle of about 70°. When the plate spun round, the lines of\r\n    force were intersected and induced currents generated, which\r\n    produced their proper effect when carried from the plate to the\r\n    galvanometer. “When the plate was in the magnetic meridian, or\r\n    in any other plane coinciding with the magnetic dip, then its\r\n    rotation produced no effect upon the galvanometer.”\r\n\r\n    At the suggestion of a mind fruitful in suggestions of a\r\n    profound and philosophic character--I mean that of Sir John\r\n    Herschel--Mr. Barlow, of Woolwich, had experimented with\r\n    a rotating iron shell. Mr. Christie had also performed an\r\n    elaborate series of experiments on a rotating iron disc. Both\r\n    of them had found that when in rotation the body exercised a\r\n    peculiar action upon the magnetic needle, deflecting it in a\r\n    manner which was not observed during quiescence; but neither\r\n    of them was aware at the time of the agent which produced this\r\n    extraordinary deflection. They ascribed it to some change in\r\n    the magnetism of the iron shell and disc.\r\n\r\n    But Faraday at once saw that his induced currents must come\r\n    into play here, and he immediately obtained them from an iron\r\n    disc. With a hollow brass ball, moreover, he produced the\r\n    effects obtained by Mr. Barlow. Iron was in no way necessary;\r\n    the only condition of success was that the rotating body\r\n    should be of a character to admit of the formation of currents\r\n    in its substance; it must, in other words, be a conductor of\r\n    electricity. The higher the conducting power, the more copious\r\n    were the currents. He now passes from his little brass globe\r\n    to the globe of the earth. He plays like a magician with the\r\n    earth’s magnetism. He sees the invisible lines along which\r\n    its magnetic action is exerted, and, sweeping his wand across\r\n    these lines, he evokes this new power. Placing a simple loop\r\n    of wire round a magnetic needle, he bends its upper portion\r\n    to the west; the north pole of the needle immediately swerves\r\n    to the east; he bends his loop to the east, and the north\r\n    pole moves to the west. Suspending a common bar magnet in a\r\n    vertical position, he causes it to spin round its own axis.\r\n    Its pole being connected with one end of a galvanometer wire,\r\n    and its equator with the other end, electricity rushes round\r\n    the galvanometer from the rotating magnet. He remarks upon the\r\n    “_singular independence_” of the magnetism and the body of\r\n    the magnet which carries it. The steel behaves as if it were\r\n    isolated from its own magnetism.\r\n\r\n    And then his thoughts suddenly widen, and he asks himself\r\n    whether the rotating earth does not generate induced\r\n    currents as it turns round its axis from west to east. In\r\n    his experiment with the twirling magnet the galvanometer\r\n    wire remained at rest; one portion of the circuit was in\r\n    motion _relatively_ to _another portion_. But in the case of\r\n    the twirling planet the galvanometer wire would necessarily\r\n    be carried along with the earth; there would be no relative\r\n    motion. What must be the consequence? Take the case of a\r\n    telegraph wire with its two terminal plates dipped into the\r\n    earth, and suppose the wire to lie in the magnetic meridian.\r\n    The ground underneath the wire is influenced, like the wire\r\n    itself, by the earth’s rotation; if a current from south to\r\n    north be generated in the wire, a similar current from south\r\n    to north would be generated in the earth under the wire; these\r\n    currents would run against the same terminal plate, and thus\r\n    neutralise each other.\r\n\r\n    This inference appears inevitable, but his profound vision\r\n    perceived its possible invalidity. He saw that it was at least\r\n    possible that the difference of conducting power between\r\n    the earth and the wire might give one an advantage over the\r\n    other, and that thus a residual or differential current might\r\n    be obtained. He combined wires of different materials, and\r\n    caused them to act in opposition to each other, but found the\r\n    combination ineffectual. The more copious flow in the better\r\n    conductor was exactly counterbalanced by the resistance of the\r\n    worst. Still, though experiment was thus emphatic, he would\r\n    clear his mind of all discomfort by operating on the earth\r\n    itself. He went to the round lake near Kensington Palace, and\r\n    stretched 480 feet of copper wire, north and south, over the\r\n    lake, causing plates soldered to the wire at its ends to dip\r\n    into the water. The copper wire was severed at the middle,\r\n    and the severed ends connected with a galvanometer. No effect\r\n    whatever was observed. But though quiescent water gave no\r\n    effect, moving water might. He therefore worked at Waterloo\r\n    Bridge for three days, during the ebb and flow of the tide, but\r\n    without any satisfactory result. Still he urges, “Theoretically\r\n    it seems a necessary consequence, that where water is flowing\r\n    there electric currents should be formed. If a line be imagined\r\n    passing from Dover to Calais through the sea and returning\r\n    through the land, beneath the water, to Dover, it traces out\r\n    a circuit of conducting matter, one part of which, when the\r\n    water moves up or down the Channel, is cutting the magnetic\r\n    curves of the earth, whilst the other is relatively at rest....\r\n    There is every reason to believe that currents do run in the\r\n    general direction of the circuit described, either one way or\r\n    the other, according as the passage of the waters is up or down\r\n    the Channel.” This was written before the submarine cable was\r\n    thought of, and he once informed me that actual observation\r\n    upon that cable had been found to be in accordance with his\r\n    theoretic deduction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nIt may here be apposite to discuss a fundamental question raised in\r\nthese researches. In Faraday’s mind there arose the conviction of\r\na connection between the induction of currents by magnets and the\r\nmagnetic lines which invisibly fill all the space in the neighbourhood\r\nof the magnet. That relation he discovered and announced in the\r\nfollowing terms:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LAW OF INDUCTION.]\r\n\r\n“The relation which holds between the magnetic pole, the moving wire\r\nor metal, and the direction of the current evolved--_i.e._ _the\r\nlaw_ which governs the evolution of electricity by magneto-electric\r\ninduction, is very simple, though rather difficult to express. If in\r\nFig. 11, P N represent a horizontal wire passing by a marked [_i.e._\r\n‘north-seeking’] magnetic pole, so that the direction of its motion\r\nshall coincide with the curved line proceeding from below upwards; or\r\nif its motion parallel to itself be in a line tangential to the curved\r\nline, but in the general direction of the arrows; or if it pass the\r\npole in other directions, but so as to cut the magnetic curves[39] in\r\nthe same general direction, or on the same side as they would be cut by\r\nthe wire if moving along the dotted curved line; then the current of\r\nelectricity in the wire is from P to N. If it be carried in the reverse\r\ndirection, the electric current will be from N to P. Or if the wire be\r\nin the vertical position, figured P´ N´, and it be carried in similar\r\ndirections, coinciding with the dotted horizontal curve so far as to\r\ncut the magnetic curves on the same side with it, the current will be\r\nfrom P´ to N´.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CUTTING THE MAGNETIC LINES.]\r\n\r\nWhen resuming the research in December, Faraday investigated the\r\npoint whether it was essential or not that the moving wire should,\r\nin “cutting” the magnetic curves, pass into positions of greater or\r\nlesser magnetic force; or whether, always intersecting curves of equal\r\nmagnetic intensity, the mere motion sufficed for the production of the\r\ncurrent. He found the latter to be true. This notion of _cutting_ the\r\ninvisible magnetic lines as the essential act necessary and sufficient\r\nfor induction was entirely original with Faraday. For long it proved\r\na stumbling-block to the abstract mathematicians, since there was, in\r\nmost cases, no direct or easy way in which to express the number of\r\nmagnetic lines that were cut. Neither had any convention been adopted\r\nup to that time as to how to reckon numerically the number of magnetic\r\nlines in any given space near a magnet. Later, in 1851, Faraday himself\r\ngave greater precision to these ideas. He found that the current was\r\nproportional to the velocity, when the conductor was moving in a\r\nuniform magnetic field with a uniform motion. Also, that the quantity\r\nof electricity thrown by induction into the circuit was directly\r\nproportional to the “amount of curves intersected.” The following\r\npassage, from Clerk Maxwell’s article on Faraday in the “Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica,” admirably sums up the matter:--\r\n\r\n    The magnitude and originality of Faraday’s achievement may be\r\n    estimated by tracing the subsequent history of his discovery.\r\n    As might be expected, it was at once made the subject of\r\n    investigation by the whole scientific world, but some of the\r\n    most experienced physicists were unable to avoid mistakes in\r\n    stating, in what they conceived to be more scientific language\r\n    than Faraday’s, the phenomena before them. Up to the present\r\n    time the mathematicians who have rejected Faraday’s method of\r\n    stating his law as unworthy of the precision of their science,\r\n    have never succeeded in devising any essentially different\r\n    formula which shall fully express the phenomena without\r\n    introducing hypotheses about the mutual action of things which\r\n    have no physical existence, such as elements of currents which\r\n    flow out of nothing, then along a wire, and finally sink into\r\n    nothing again.\r\n\r\n    After nearly half a century of labour of this kind, we may say\r\n    that, though the practical applications of Faraday’s discovery\r\n    have increased and are increasing in number and value every\r\n    year, no exception to the statement of these laws as given by\r\n    Faraday has been discovered, no new law has been added to them,\r\n    and Faraday’s original statement remains to this day the only\r\n    one which asserts no more than can be verified by experiment,\r\n    and the only one by which the theory of the phenomena can\r\n    be expressed in a manner which is exactly and numerically\r\n    accurate, and at the same time within the range of elementary\r\n    methods of exposition.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1831, which witnessed this masterpiece of scientific\r\nresearch, Faraday was busy in many other ways. He was still undertaking\r\nchemical analyses and expert work for fees, as witness his letter to\r\nPhillips on p. 62. He was also, until November, on the Council of the\r\nRoyal Society. To the “Philosophical Transactions” he contributed\r\na paper “On Vibrating Surfaces,” in which he solved a problem in\r\nacoustics which had previously gone without explanation. It had long\r\nbeen known that in the experiments of obtaining the patterns called\r\n“Chladni’s figures,” by strewing powders upon vibrating plates, while\r\nthe heavier powders, such as sand, moved into the nodal lines, lighter\r\nsubstances, such as lycopodium dust, collected in little circular\r\nheaps over the parts where the vibration was most energetic. Faraday’s\r\nexplanation was that these lighter powders were caught and whirled\r\nabout in little vortices which formed themselves at spots where the\r\nmotions were of greatest amplitude.\r\n\r\nHe also wrote a paper “On a Peculiar Class of Optical Deceptions,”\r\ndealing with the illusions that result from the eye being shown in\r\nsuccessive glimpses, as between the teeth of a revolving wheel,\r\ndifferent views of a moving body. This research was, in effect, the\r\nstarting point of a whole line of optical toys, beginning with the\r\nphenakistiscope or stroboscope, which developed through the zoetrope\r\nand praxino-scope into the kinematograph and animatograph of recent\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LECTURES ON PHYSICAL SUBJECTS.]\r\n\r\nHe gave four afternoon lectures at the Royal Institution and five\r\nFriday evening discourses. These were on optical deceptions, on light\r\nand phosphorescence, being an account of experiments recently made by\r\nMr. Pearsall, chemical assistant in the Institution; on oxalamide, then\r\nrecently discovered by M. Dumas; on Trevelyan’s experiments about the\r\nproduction of sound by heated bodies; and on the arrangements assumed\r\nby particles upon vibrating surfaces.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 he gave five Friday evening discourses, four of which related\r\nto his own researches. In August he entered upon the third series\r\nof “Experimental Researches in Electricity,” which was devoted to\r\nthe identity of electricities derived from different sources, and on\r\nthe relation by measure of common [_i.e._ frictional] and voltaic\r\nelectricity. He did not like any doubt to hang about as to whether\r\nthe electricity obtained from magnets by induction was really the\r\nsame as that obtainable from other sources. Possibly he had in his\r\nmind the difficulties which had arisen thirty years before over the\r\ndiscoveries of Galvani and Volta, when it was so far doubted whether\r\nthe electricity in currents from piles and batteries of cells was\r\nthe same as the electricity evoked by friction, that the distinctive\r\nand misleading name of “galvanism” was assigned to the former.\r\nHe commented on the circumstance that many philosophers--and he\r\nincluded Davy by name in an explicit reference--were vainly drawing\r\ndistinctions[40] between electricities from different sources, or at\r\nleast doubting whether their identity were proven. His first point\r\nwas to consider whether “common electricity,” “animal electricity,”\r\nand “magneto-electric currents” could, like “voltaic electricity,”\r\nproduce chemical decompositions. He began by demonstrating that an\r\nordinary electric discharge from a friction machine can affect a\r\nsuitably disposed galvanometer. One of his instruments of sufficient\r\nsensitiveness was surrounded by an enclosing cage of double metal\r\nfoil and wire-work, duly connected to “earth,” so as to render it\r\nindependent of all disturbances by external electric charges in its\r\nneighbourhood. His “earth” for this purpose consisted of a stout metal\r\nwire connected through the pipes in the house to the metallic gas-pipes\r\nbelonging to the public gas works of London, and also with the metallic\r\nwater-pipes of London--an effectual “discharging train.” He used a\r\nfriction electric machine with a glass plate 50 inches in diameter,\r\nand a Leyden-jar battery of fifteen jars, each having about 84 square\r\ninches of coated glass. This battery of jars was first charged from the\r\nmachine and then discharged through a wet thread four feet long, and\r\nthrough the galvanometer to earth _viâ_ the “discharging train.” Having\r\nby this means satisfied himself that these electric discharges could\r\ndeflect a galvanometer, whether through the wet thread, a copper wire,\r\nor through water, or rarefied air, or by connection through points in\r\nair, he went on to the question of chemical decomposition. Dipping two\r\nsilver wires into a drop of solution of sulphate of copper, he found\r\nthat one of them became copper-plated by the electricity that was\r\nevolved by 100 or 200 turns of the disc machine. He bleached indigo,\r\nturned starch purple with iodine liberated from iodide of potassium,\r\nexactly as might have been done by a “volta-electric current” from a\r\nbattery of cells. He also decomposed water, giving due recognition to\r\nthe antecedent experiments of Van Troostwyk, Pearson, and Wollaston.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IDENTITY OF ELECTRICITIES.]\r\n\r\nIn the paper which he drew up he compares these results with others\r\nmade with electric discharges from an electric kite and with those of\r\nthe torpedo and other electric fishes. He recapitulates the properties\r\nof magneto-electricity and the proofs now accumulating that it can\r\ndecompose water. He drew up a schedule of the different effects which\r\nelectricity can produce, and of the different sources of electricity,\r\nshowing in tabular form how far each so-called kind of electricity\r\nhad been found to produce each effect. The conclusion was that there\r\nis no philosophical difference between the different cases; since the\r\nphenomena produced by the different kinds of electricity differ not in\r\ntheir character but only in degree. “_Electricity, whatever may be its\r\nsource, is identical in its nature._” On comparing the effects produced\r\nby different discharges, he concludes that “if the same absolute\r\nquantity[41] of electricity pass through the galvanometer, whatever may\r\nbe its intensity, the deflecting force upon the magnetic needle is the\r\nsame.” He was then able to go on to a quantitative comparison between\r\nthe “quantity” of electricity from different sources, and came to the\r\nconclusion that both in magnetic deflection and in chemical force the\r\ncurrent of electricity given by his standard battery for eight beats of\r\nhis watch was equal to that of the friction machine evolved by thirty\r\nrevolutions; further, that “the chemical power, like the magnetic\r\nforce, is in direct proportion to the absolute quantity of electricity\r\nwhich passes.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ELECTRO-CHEMICAL WORK.]\r\n\r\nThis series of researches was published in January, 1833. In April\r\nof the same year he sent to the Royal Society another paper--the\r\nfourth series--on electric conduction. It arose from the surprising\r\nobservation that, though water conducts, ice acts as a complete\r\nnon-conductor. This led to an examination of the conducting power of\r\nfusible solids in general. He found that as a rule--excepting on the\r\none hand the metals, which conduct whether solid or liquid, and on the\r\nother hand fatty bodies, which are always non-conductors--they assume\r\nconducting power when liquefied, and lose it when congealed. Chloride\r\nof lead, of silver, of potassium, and of sodium, and many chlorates,\r\nnitrates, sulphates, and many other salts and fusible substances were\r\nfound to follow this rule. All the substances so found to act were\r\ncompound bodies, and capable of decomposition by the current. When\r\nconduction ceased, decomposition ceased also. An apparent exception was\r\nfound in sulphide of silver, which, when heated, acquired conducting\r\npowers even before it assumed the liquid state, yet decomposed in the\r\nsolid state. This led him on to study electro-chemical decompositions\r\nmore closely. Here he was following directly in the footsteps of his\r\nmaster Davy, whose discovery of the decomposition of potash and soda\r\nby the electric current had been one of the most prominent scientific\r\nadvances resulting from the invention of the voltaic cell. The fifth\r\nseries of researches, published in June, 1833, embodies the work. He\r\nfirst combats the prevailing opinion that the presence of water is\r\nnecessary for electro-chemical decomposition; then analyses the views\r\nof various philosophers--Grotthuss, Davy, De la Rive, and others--who\r\nhad discussed the question whether the decompositions are due to\r\nattractions exercised by the two poles of the electric circuit. This he\r\ncontests in the most direct manner. Already he has reason to believe\r\nthat for a given quantity of electricity passed through the liquid\r\nthe amount of electro-chemical action is a constant quantity, and\r\ndepends in no way on the distance of the particles of the decomposable\r\nsubstance from the poles. He regards the elements as progressing in two\r\nstreams in opposite directions parallel to the current, while the poles\r\n“are merely the surfaces or doors by which the electricity enters into\r\nor passes out of the substance suffering decomposition.”\r\n\r\nAmongst the laboratory notes of this time are many which were never\r\npublished in the “Experimental Researches,” or of which only brief\r\nabstracts appeared. Some of these are of great interest.\r\n\r\nHere is one literally transcribed:--\r\n\r\n    26 Feb. 1833.\r\n\r\n    _Chloride Magnesium._--When solid and wire fuzed in\r\n    non-conductor--When fuzed conducted very well and was\r\n    decomposed A and P Pole much action and gas--chlorine? At N\r\n    Pole Magnesium separated and no gas. Sometimes Magnesium burnt\r\n    flying off in globules burning brilliantly. When wire at that\r\n    pole put in water or white M A [muriatic acid] matter round\r\n    it acted powerfully evolving hydrogen and forming Magnesia;\r\n    and when wire and surrounding matter heated in spirit lamp\r\n    _Magnesium_ burnt with intense light into _Magnesia_. VERY GOOD\r\n    EXPT.\r\n\r\nThis recalls the “capital experiment” entry which Sir Humphry Davy\r\nwrote after the account of his decomposition of caustic potash. On the\r\n7th of April we come to a marvellous page of speculations. He has seen\r\nthat liquids, both solutions and fused salts, can be decomposed by\r\nthe current, and that at least one solid is capable of electrolysis.\r\nBut he finds that alloys and metals are not decomposed. He finds\r\nthat electrolysis is easiest for those compounds that consist of the\r\nmost diverse elements, and is led on to speculate as to the possible\r\nconstitution of those conductors that the current does not decompose.\r\nThis may involve a recasting of accepted ideas; but from such a step he\r\ndoes not shrink, as the following extracts show:--\r\n\r\n    Metals _may_ not be compounds of elements most frequently\r\n    combined, but rather of such as are so similar to each other as\r\n    to pass out of the limit of voltaic decomposition.\r\n\r\n    13th April (same page).\r\n\r\n    If voltaic decomposition of the kind I believe then review\r\n    all substances upon the new view to see if they may not be\r\n    decomposable, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ATTRACTION BY POLES DOUBTED.]\r\n\r\nHe has now found that the facts observed do not admit of being\r\nexplained on the supposition that the motion of the ions is due to the\r\nattraction of the poles, and accordingly there follows the entry:--\r\n\r\n    (Ap. 13, 1833.)\r\n\r\n    A single element is never attracted by a pole, _i.e._ without\r\n    attraction of other element at other pole. Hence doubt Mr.\r\n    Brande’s Expts on attraction of gases and vapours. Doubt\r\n    attraction by poles altogether.\r\n\r\nTo this subject he returned in 1834; an intervening memoir--the\r\nsixth--being taken up with the power of metals and solids to bring\r\nabout the combination of gaseous bodies. In the seventh series,\r\npublished in January, 1834, his first work is to explain the new\r\nterms which he has adopted, on the advice of Whewell, to express the\r\nfacts. The so-called poles, being in his view merely doors or ways by\r\nwhich the current passes, he now terms _electrodes_, distinguishing\r\nthe entrance and exit respectively as _anode_ and _cathode_,[42]\r\nwhile the decomposable liquid is termed an _electrolyte_, and the\r\ndecomposing process _electrolysis_. “Finally,” he says, in a passage\r\n(here italicised) worthy to be engraved in gold for the essential\r\ntruth it enunciates on a question of terminology, “I require a term to\r\nexpress those bodies which can pass to the _electrodes_, or, as they\r\nare usually called, the poles. Substances are frequently spoken of as\r\nbeing _electronegative_, or _electropositive_, according as they go\r\nunder the supposed influence of a direct attraction to the positive or\r\nnegative pole. But these terms are much too significant for the use to\r\nwhich I should have to put them; _for though the meanings are perhaps\r\nright, they are only hypothetical, and may be wrong; and then, through\r\na very imperceptible but still very dangerous, because continual,\r\ninfluence, they do great injury to science, by contracting and limiting\r\nthe habitual views of those engaged in pursuing it_. I propose to\r\ndistinguish such bodies by calling those _anions_ which go to the anode\r\nof the decomposing body; and those passing to the _cathode_, _cations_;\r\nand when I shall have occasion to speak of these together, I shall\r\ncall them _ions_.[43] Thus, the chloride of lead is an _electrolyte_,\r\nand when _electrolyzed_ evolves the two _ions_, chlorine and lead, the\r\nformer being an _anion_ and the latter a _cation_.” In Faraday’s own\r\nbound volume of the “Experimental Researches” he has illustrated these\r\nterms by the sketch here reproduced. (Fig. 12.)\r\n\r\nFaraday’s letter to Whewell when he consulted him as to the new words\r\nhas not been preserved. He discarded, when the paper was printed, the\r\nterms he had first used. Whewell’s replies of April 25th and May 5th,\r\n1834, have been preserved and are printed in Todhunter’s biography\r\nof Whewell. From the later of the two the following passage is\r\nextracted:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEW NOMENCLATURE.]\r\n\r\n    [_Whewell to Faraday_], May 5, 1834.\r\n\r\n    If you take _anode_ and _cathode_, I would propose for the two\r\n    elements resulting from _electrolysis_ the terms _anion_ and\r\n    _cation_, which are neuter participles signifying _that which\r\n    goes up_, and _that which goes down_; and for the two together\r\n    you might use the term _ions_.... The word is not a substantive\r\n    in Greek, but it may easily be so taken, and I am persuaded\r\n    that the brevity and simplicity of the terms you will thus have\r\n    will in a fortnight procure their universal acceptation. The\r\n    _anion_ is that which goes to the _anode_, the _cation_ is that\r\n    which goes to the _cathode_. The _th_ in the latter word arises\r\n    from the aspirate in _hodos_ (way), and therefore is not to be\r\n    introduced in cases where the second term has not an aspirate,\r\n    as _ion_ has not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nOn May 15th Faraday replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n    [_Faraday to Whewell._]\r\n\r\n    I have taken your advice and the names, and use _anode_,\r\n    _cathode_, _anions_, _cations_ and _ions_; the last I shall\r\n    have but little occasion for. I had some hot objections made to\r\n    them here, and found myself very much in the condition of the\r\n    man with his Son and Ass, who tried to please everybody; but\r\n    when I held up the shield of your authority it was wonderful\r\n    to observe how the tone of objection melted away. I am quite\r\n    delighted with the facility of expression which the new terms\r\n    give me, and shall ever be your debtor for the kind assistance\r\n    you have given me.\r\n\r\nAs though to prepare the way for a still further cutting of himself\r\nadrift from the slavery of using terms that might be found misleading,\r\nhe added the following note:--\r\n\r\n    It will be well understood that I am giving no opinion\r\n    respecting the nature of the electric current now, beyond what\r\n    I have done on former occasions; and that though I speak of\r\n    the current as proceeding from the parts which are positive to\r\n    those which are negative, it is merely in accordance with the\r\n    conventional, though in some degree tacit, agreement entered\r\n    into by scientific men, that they may have a constant, certain,\r\n    and definite means of referring to the direction of the forces\r\n    of that current.\r\n\r\nThe “former occasions” is a reference to an earlier suggestion that\r\na _current_ might mean anything progressive, whether a flow in one\r\ndirection or two fluids moving in opposite directions, or merely\r\nvibrations, or, still more generally, progressive forces. He had\r\nexpressly said that what we call the electric current “may perhaps best\r\nbe conceived of as _an axis of power having contrary forces, exactly\r\nequal in amount, in contrary directions_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ELECTRO-CHEMICAL LAWS.]\r\n\r\nHe then suggests as a measurer of current the standard form of\r\nelectrolytic cell ever since known as the _voltameter_. He preferred\r\nthat kind in which water is decomposed, the quantity of electricity\r\nwhich had flowed through it being measured by the quantity of the\r\ngas or gases evolved during the operation. Before adopting this he\r\nundertook careful experiments in which his fine manipulative skill, no\r\nless than his chemical experience, was called into service to verify\r\nthe fact that the quantity of water decomposed was really proportionate\r\nto the quantity of electricity which has been passed through the\r\ninstrument. Having this standard, he investigated numerous other cases\r\nof decomposition by the current, and so arrived at a substantial basis\r\nfor the doctrine of _definite electro-chemical_ action. Speaking of\r\nthe substances into which electrolytes are divided by the current,\r\nand which he had called ions, he says: “They are combining bodies;\r\nare directly associated with the fundamental parts of the doctrine\r\nof chemical affinity; and have each a definite proportion, in which\r\nthey are always evolved during electrolytic action.... I have proposed\r\nto call the numbers representing the proportions in which they are\r\nevolved _electro-chemical equivalents_. Thus hydrogen, oxygen,\r\nchlorine, iodine, lead, tin are _ions_; the three former are _anions_,\r\nthe two metals _cations_, and 1, 8, 36, 125, 104, 58, are their\r\n_electro-chemical equivalents_ nearly.”\r\n\r\nThis fundamental law being set upon an impregnable basis of facts,\r\nhe goes on to speculate upon the _absolute quantity_ of electricity\r\nor electric power belonging to different bodies; a notion which only\r\nwithin the last few years has found general acceptance.\r\n\r\nIn developing this theory he uses the following language:--\r\n\r\n    According to it [_i.e._ this theory], the equivalent weights of\r\n    bodies are simply those quantities of them which contain equal\r\n    quantities of electricity, or have naturally equal electric\r\n    powers; it being the ELECTRICITY which _determines_ the\r\n    equivalent number, _because_ it determines the combining force.\r\n    Or, if we adopt the atomic theory or phraseology, then the\r\n    atoms of bodies which are equivalents to each other in their\r\n    ordinary chemical action, have equal quantities of electricity\r\n    naturally associated with them. But I must confess I am jealous\r\n    of the term _atom_....\r\n\r\nHere we find the modern doctrine of _electrons_ or unitary atomic\r\ncharges, clearly formulated in 1834. In the course of this speculation\r\nhe remarks that “if the electrical power which holds the elements of\r\na grain of water in combination, or which makes a grain of oxygen or\r\nhydrogen in the right proportions unite into water when they are made\r\nto combine, could be thrown into the condition of _a current_, it\r\nwould exactly equal the current required for the separation of that\r\ngrain of water into its elements again.” And all this years before\r\nthere was any doctrine of the conservation of energy to guide the mind\r\nof the philosopher! The passage just cited contains the germs of the\r\nthermodynamic theory of electromotive forces worked out a dozen years\r\nlater by Sir William Thomson (now Lord Kelvin), by which theory we can\r\npredict the electromotive forces of any given chemical combination from\r\na knowledge of the heat evolved by a given mass of the product in the\r\nact of combining.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER UNSUCCESSFUL QUEST.]\r\n\r\nThe eighth series of the researches, which was read in June, 1834,\r\ndeals chiefly with voltaic cells and batteries of cells. He is now\r\napplying to the operations inside the primary cell the electrochemical\r\nprinciples learned by the study of electrolysis in secondary cells.\r\nHis thoughts have been incessantly playing around the problem of\r\nelectrolytic conduction. He was convinced that the forces which shear\r\nthe anions from combination with the cations and transfer them in\r\nopposite directions must be inherent before the circuit is completed,\r\nand therefore before any actual transfer or movement takes place. “It\r\nseems to me impossible,” he says, “to resist the idea that it [the\r\n“transfer,” or “what is called the voltaic current”] must be preceded\r\nby a _state of tension_ in the fluid. I have sought carefully for\r\nindications of a state of tension in the electrolytic conductor; and\r\nconceiving that it might produce something like structure, either\r\nbefore or during its discharge, I endeavoured to make this evident by\r\npolarised light.” He used a solution of sulphate of soda, but without\r\nthe slightest trace of optical action in any direction of the ray. He\r\nrepeated the experiment, using a solid electrolyte, borate of lead, in\r\nits non-conducting state, but equally without result.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of these electrochemical researches in 1833 and 1834,\r\nFaraday’s activities for the Royal Institution were undiminished. In\r\n1833 he gave seven Friday discourses, three of them on the researches\r\nin hand, one on Wheatstone’s investigation of the velocity of the\r\nelectric spark, and one on the practical prevention of dry rot in\r\ntimber, which was afterwards republished as a pamphlet, and ran to\r\ntwo editions. In 1834 he gave four Friday discourses; two on his\r\nelectrochemical researches, one on Ericsson’s heat-engine, and the\r\nother on caoutchouc.\r\n\r\nThe ninth series of electrical researches occupied the autumn of 1834.\r\nIn it he returns to the study of the magnetic and inductive actions\r\nof the current, investigating the self-induced spark at the break\r\nof the circuit, to which his attention had been directed by Mr. W.\r\nJenkin. Several points in this research are little known even now to\r\nelectricians, the laboratory notes being much more detailed than the\r\npublished paper. He describes an exceedingly neat high-speed break\r\nfor producing rapid interruptions, using for that purpose stationary\r\nripples on the surface of a pool of mercury. In a wonderful day’s work\r\non 13th November, filling thirty-four pages of the laboratory book,\r\nillustrated with numerous unpublished sketches, he tracks out the\r\nproperties of self-induction. He proves that the spark (on breaking\r\ncircuit) from a wire coiled up in a helix is far brighter than that\r\nfrom an identical wire laid out straight. He finds that a non-inductive\r\nand, therefore, sparkless coil can be made by winding the wire in two\r\nopposite helices. “Thus the whole [inductive] effect of the length\r\nof wire was neutralised by the reciprocal and contrary action of the\r\ntwo halves which constituted the helices in contrary directions.” The\r\nnext day he writes: “These effects show that every part of an electric\r\ncircuit is acting by induction on the neighbouring parts of the same\r\ncurrent, even in the _same wire_ and the _same part_ of the wire.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EFFECTS OF SELF-INDUCTION.]\r\n\r\nOn 22nd November he is trying another set of experiments, also never\r\nfully published. They relate to the diminution of self-induction of a\r\nstraight conductor by dividing it into several parallel strands at a\r\nsmall distance apart from one another. The note in the laboratory book\r\nruns thus:--\r\n\r\n    Copper wire 1/23 of inch in diameter. Six lengths of five feet\r\n    each, soldered at ends to piece of copper plate so as form\r\n    terminations, and these amalgamated. When this bundle was used\r\n    to connect the electro-motor it gave but very feeble spark on\r\n    breaking contact, but the spark was sensibly better when the\r\n    wires are held together so as to act laterally than when they\r\n    were opened out from each other, thus showing lateral action.\r\n\r\n    Made a larger bundle of the same fine copper wire. There were\r\n    20 lengths of 18 feet 2 inches each and the thick terminal\r\n    pieces of copper wire 6 inches long and ⅓ of inch thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nThis bundle he compared with a length of 19 feet 6 inches of a single\r\ncopper wire ⅕ inch in diameter, having about equal sectional area. The\r\nlatter gave decidedly the largest sparks on breaking circuit.\r\n\r\nFaraday did not see fit at this time to accept the idea, suggested\r\nindeed by himself in 1831, that these effects of self-induction were\r\nthe analogue of momentum or inertia. That explanation he set aside\r\non finding that the same wire when coiled had greater self-inductive\r\naction than when straight. Had he at that time grasped this analogy, he\r\nwould have seen that the very property which gives rise to the spark\r\nat break of circuit also retards the rapid growth of a current; and\r\nthen the experiment described above would have shown him that Sir W.\r\nSnow Harris was right in preferring flat copper ribbon to a round wire\r\nof equivalent section as a material for lightning conductors. He was,\r\nhowever, disappointed to find so small a difference between round wires\r\nand parallel strands. The memoir as published contains an exceedingly\r\ninteresting conclusion:--\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding that the effects appear only at the making\r\n    and breaking of contact (the current, remaining unaffected,\r\n    seemingly, in the interval,) I cannot resist the impression\r\n    that there is some connected and correspondent effect produced\r\n    by this lateral action of the elements of the electric stream\r\n    during the time of its continuance. An action of this kind,\r\n    in fact, is evident in the magnetic relations of the parts\r\n    of the current. But admitting (as we may do for the moment)\r\n    the magnetic forces to constitute the power which produces\r\n    such striking and different results at the commencement and\r\n    termination of a current, still there appears to be a link in\r\n    the chain of effects--a wheel in the physical mechanism of the\r\n    action, as yet unrecognised.\r\n\r\nThe tenth series of researches, on the voltaic battery, though\r\ncompleted in October, 1834, was not published till June, 1835.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ACTION IN A MEDIUM.]\r\n\r\nThe next research, begun in the autumn of 1835, after a lull of\r\nabout eight months, lasted over two years. It was not completed till\r\nDecember, 1837. This investigation took Faraday away from magnetic\r\nand electrochemical matters to the old subject of statical electric\r\ncharges, a subject hitherto untouched in his researches. But he had\r\nlong brooded over the question as to the nature of an electric charge.\r\nOver and over again, as he had watched the inductive effect of electric\r\ncurrents acting from wire to wire, his mind turned to the old problem\r\nof the inductive influence--discovered eighty years before, by John\r\nCanton--exerted, apparently at a distance, by electric charges. He\r\nhad learned to distrust action at a distance, and now the time was\r\nripe for a searching inquiry as to whether electric _influence_, or\r\ninduction[44] as it was then called, was also an action propagated by\r\ncontiguous actions in the intervening medium.\r\n\r\nFaraday had done no special electric work during the first nine months\r\nof 1835. He had worked at a chemical investigation of fluorine through\r\nthe spring, and in July took a hurried tour in Switzerland, and\r\nreturned to work at fluorine. Not till November 3rd does he turn to the\r\nsubject over which he had been brooding. On that date, intercalated\r\nbetween notes of his chemical studies, filling a dozen pages of the\r\nlaboratory book, are a magnificent series of speculations as to the\r\nnature of charges, and on the part played by the electric--or, as we\r\nshould now say, the dielectric--medium. They begin thus:--\r\n\r\n“Have been thinking much lately of the relation of common and\r\nvoltaic electricity, of induction by the former and decomposition by\r\nthe latter, and am quite convinced that there must be the closest\r\nconnection. Will be first needful to make out the true character”--note\r\nthe phrase--“of ordinary electrical phenomena.” The following notes\r\nare for experiment and observation.\r\n\r\n“Does common electricity reside upon the surface of a conductor or upon\r\nthe surface of the [di-]electric in contact with it?”\r\n\r\nHe goes on to consider the state of a dielectric substance, such as\r\nglass, when situated between a positively charged and a negatively\r\ncharged surface, as in a charged Leyden jar, and argues from analogy\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n“Hence the state of the plate [of glass] under induction is the same\r\nas the state of a magnet, and if split or broken would present new\r\nP[ositive] and N[egative] surfaces before not at all evident.” This\r\nspeculation was later verified by Matteucci.\r\n\r\n“Probable that phenomena of induction prove more decidedly than\r\nanything else that the electricity is in the [di-]electric not in the\r\nconductor.”\r\n\r\nHe still worked for a week or two on fluorine, interposing some\r\nexperiments on the temperature-limit of magnetisation, but on December\r\n4th decides not to go on with fluorine at present. Then, beginning on\r\nDecember 5th, there follow twenty-nine pages of the laboratory diary,\r\nillustrated with sketches. He had borrowed from a Mr. Kipp a large\r\ndeep copper pan thirty-five inches in diameter, and he set to work\r\nelectrifying it and exploring the distribution of the charges, inside\r\nand out, and the inductive effect on objects placed within. Everywhere\r\nhe is mentally comparing the distribution of the effects with that of\r\nthe flow of currents in an electrolyte. Before many days he writes:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PREGNANT SUGGESTIONS.]\r\n\r\n“It appears to me at present that _ordinary_ and _electrolytic_\r\ninduction are identical in their first nature, but that the latter is\r\nfollowed by an effect which cannot but from the nature and state of\r\nthe substances take place with the former.” Then comes this pregnant\r\nsuggestion:--\r\n\r\n“Try induction through a solid crystalline body as to the consequent\r\naction on polarized light.”\r\n\r\nBy the end of a week he had begun to suspect that his magnet analogy\r\nwent farther than he was at first prepared to hold. The action of a\r\nmagnet was along curved lines of force. So he asks:--\r\n\r\n“Can induction through air take place in curves or round a corner--can\r\nprobably be found experimentally--if so not a radiating effect.”\r\n\r\nAfter ten days more he has made another step.\r\n\r\n“Electricity appears to exist only in _polarity_ as in air, glass,\r\nelectrolytes, etc. Now metals, being conductors, cannot take up that\r\npolar state of their own power, or rather retain it, and hence probably\r\ncannot retain developed electric forces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Metals, however, probably hold it for a moment, as other things do for\r\na longer time; an end coming at last to all.”\r\n\r\nThis, it will be observed, is nothing more or less than Clerk Maxwell’s\r\ntheory of conduction as being the breaking down of an electrostatic\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1836, followed the famous experiment of building a\r\ntwelve-foot cube, which when electrified exteriorly to the utmost\r\nextent, showed inside no trace of electric forces. The account in the\r\nunpublished MS. of the laboratory book is, as is the case with so\r\nmany of these middle-period researches, much fuller than the published\r\n_résumé_ of them in the “Experimental Researches.” All through 1836\r\nhe was still at work. Even when on a holiday in the Isle of Wight, in\r\nAugust, he took his notebook with him, and writes:--\r\n\r\n“After much consideration (here at Ryde) of the manner in which the\r\nelectric forces are arranged in the various phenomena generally, I have\r\ncome to certain conclusions which I will endeavour to note down without\r\ncommitting myself to any opinion as to the cause of electricity, _i.e._\r\nas to the nature of the power. If electricity exist independently of\r\nmatter, then I think that the hypothesis of one fluid will not stand\r\nagainst that of two fluids. There are, I think, evidently, what I may\r\ncall two elements of power of equal force and acting towards each\r\nother. These may conventionally be represented by oxygen and hydrogen,\r\nwhich represent them in the voltaic battery. But these powers may be\r\ndistinguished only _by direction_, and may be no more separate than the\r\nnorth and south forces in the elements of a magnetic needle. They may\r\nbe the polar points of the forces originally placed in the particles of\r\nmatter; and the description of the current as an axis of power which I\r\nhave formerly given suggests some similar general impression for the\r\nforces of quiescent electricity. Law of electric tension might do, and\r\nthough I shall use the terms positive and negative, by them I merely\r\nmean the termini of such lines.”\r\n\r\nRight on until November 30th, 1837, this research was continued. The\r\nsummary of this and the succeeding researches of 1838 on the same\r\nsubject, drawn up by Professor Tyndall,[45] is at once so masterly\r\nand so impartial that it cannot be bettered. It is therefore here\r\ntranscribed without alteration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ACTION AT A DISTANCE UNTHINKABLE.]\r\n\r\n    His first great paper on frictional electricity was sent to\r\n    the Royal Society on November 30, 1837. We here find him face\r\n    to face with an idea which beset his mind throughout his\r\n    whole subsequent life--the idea of _action at a distance_. It\r\n    perplexed and bewildered him. In his attempts to get rid of\r\n    this perplexity he was often unconsciously rebelling against\r\n    the limitations of the intellect itself. He loved to quote\r\n    Newton upon this point: over and over again he introduces his\r\n    memorable words, “That gravity should be innate, inherent, and\r\n    essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another\r\n    at a distance through a _vacuum_ and without the mediation\r\n    of anything else, by and through which this action and force\r\n    may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an\r\n    absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical\r\n    matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.\r\n    Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according\r\n    to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or\r\n    immaterial I have left to the consideration of my readers.”[46]\r\n\r\n    Faraday does not see the same difficulty in his contiguous\r\n    particles. And yet by transferring the conception from masses\r\n    to particles we simply lessen size and distance, but we do not\r\n    alter the quality of the conception. Whatever difficulty the\r\n    mind experiences in conceiving of action at sensible distances,\r\n    besets it also when it attempts to conceive of action at\r\n    insensible distances. Still the investigation of the point\r\n    whether electric and magnetic effects were wrought out through\r\n    the intervention of contiguous particles or not, had a physical\r\n    interest altogether apart from the metaphysical difficulty.\r\n    Faraday grapples with the subject experimentally. By simple\r\n    intuition he sees that action at a distance must be exerted in\r\n    straight lines. Gravity, he knows, will not turn a corner, but\r\n    exerts its pull along a right line; hence his aim and effort to\r\n    ascertain whether electric action ever takes place in curved\r\n    lines. This once proved, it would follow that the action is\r\n    carried on _by means of a medium_ surrounding the electrified\r\n    bodies. His experiments in 1837 reduced, in his opinion, this\r\n    point to demonstration. He then found that he could electrify\r\n    by induction an insulated sphere placed completely in the\r\n    shadow of a body which screened it from direct action. He\r\n    pictured the lines of electric force bending round the edges\r\n    of the screen, and reuniting on the other side of it; and he\r\n    proved that in many cases the augmentation of the distance\r\n    between his insulated sphere and the inducing body, instead of\r\n    lessening, increased the charge of the sphere. This he ascribed\r\n    to the coalescence of the lines of electric force at some\r\n    distance behind the screen.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: SPECIFIC INDUCTIVE CAPACITY.]\r\n\r\n    Faraday’s theoretic views on this subject have not received\r\n    general acceptance, but they drove him to experiment, and\r\n    experiment with him was always prolific of results. By suitable\r\n    arrangements he places a metallic sphere in the middle of a\r\n    large hollow sphere, leaving a space of something more than\r\n    half an inch between them. The interior sphere was insulated,\r\n    the external one uninsulated. To the former he communicated a\r\n    definite charge of electricity. It acted by induction upon the\r\n    concave surface of the latter, and he examined how this act of\r\n    induction was affected by placing insulators of various kinds\r\n    between the two spheres. He tried gases, liquids, and solids,\r\n    but the solids alone gave him positive results. He constructed\r\n    two instruments of the foregoing description, equal in size\r\n    and similar in form. The interior sphere of each communicated\r\n    with the external air by a brass stem ending in a knob. The\r\n    apparatus was virtually a Leyden jar, the two coatings of which\r\n    were the two spheres, with a thick and variable insulator\r\n    between them. The amount of charge in each jar was determined\r\n    by bringing a proof-plane into contact with its knob, and\r\n    measuring by a torsion balance the charge taken away. He first\r\n    charged one of his instruments, and then dividing the charge\r\n    with the other, found that when air intervened in both cases,\r\n    the charge was equally divided. But when shell-lac, sulphur,\r\n    or spermaceti was interposed between the two spheres of one\r\n    jar, while air occupied this interval in the other, then he\r\n    found that the instrument occupied by the “solid dielectric”\r\n    took _more than half_ the original charge. A portion of the\r\n    charge was absorbed in the dielectric itself. The electricity\r\n    took time to penetrate the dielectric. Immediately after the\r\n    discharge of the apparatus no trace of electricity was found\r\n    upon its knob. But after a time electricity was found there,\r\n    the charge having gradually returned from the dielectric in\r\n    which it had been lodged. Different insulators possess this\r\n    power of permitting the charge to enter them in different\r\n    degrees. Faraday figured their particles as polarised, and\r\n    he concluded that the force of induction is propagated from\r\n    particle to particle of the dielectric from the inner sphere\r\n    to the outer one. This power of propagation possessed by\r\n    insulators he calls their “_Specific Inductive Capacity_.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\n    Faraday visualises with the utmost clearness the state of his\r\n    contiguous particles; one after another they become charged,\r\n    each succeeding particle depending for its charge upon its\r\n    predecessor. And now he seeks to break down the wall of\r\n    partition between conductors and insulators. “Can we not,” he\r\n    says, “by a gradual chain of association carry up discharge\r\n    from its occurrence in air through spermaceti and water to\r\n    solutions, and then on to chlorides, oxides, and metals,\r\n    without any essential change in its character?” Even copper, he\r\n    urges, offers a resistance to the transmission of electricity.\r\n    The action of its particles differs from those of an insulator\r\n    only in degree. They are charged like the particles of the\r\n    insulator, but they discharge with greater ease and rapidity;\r\n    and this rapidity of molecular discharge is what we call\r\n    conduction. Conduction, then, is always preceded by atomic\r\n    induction; and when through some quality of the body, which\r\n    Faraday does not define, the atomic discharge is rendered slow\r\n    and difficult, conduction passes into insulation.\r\n\r\n    Though they are often obscure, a fine vein of philosophic\r\n    thought runs through these investigations. The mind of the\r\n    philosopher dwells amid those agencies which underlie the\r\n    visible phenomena of induction and conduction; and he tries by\r\n    the strong light of his imagination to see the very molecules\r\n    of his dielectrics. It would, however, be easy to criticise\r\n    these researches, easy to show the looseness, and sometimes\r\n    the inaccuracy, of the phraseology employed; but this critical\r\n    spirit will get little good out of Faraday. Rather let those\r\n    who ponder his works seek to realise the object he set before\r\n    him, not permitting his occasional vagueness to interfere\r\n    with their appreciation of his speculations. We may see the\r\n    ripples, and eddies, and vortices of a flowing stream, without\r\n    being able to resolve all these motions into their constituent\r\n    elements; and so it sometimes strikes me that Faraday clearly\r\n    saw the play of fluids and ethers and atoms, though his\r\n    previous training did not enable him to resolve what he saw\r\n    into its constituents, or describe it in a manner satisfactory\r\n    to a mind versed in mechanics. And then again occur, I\r\n    confess, dark sayings, difficult to be understood, which\r\n    disturb my confidence in this conclusion. It must, however,\r\n    always be remembered that he works at the very boundaries of\r\n    our knowledge, and that his mind habitually dwells in the\r\n    “boundless contiguity of shade” by which that knowledge is\r\n    surrounded.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: CABLE RETARDATION PREDICTED.]\r\n\r\n    In the researches now under review the ratio of speculation and\r\n    reasoning to experiment is far higher than in any of Faraday’s\r\n    previous works. Amid much that is entangled and dark we have\r\n    flashes of wondrous insight and utterances which seem less\r\n    the product of reasoning than of revelation. I will confine\r\n    myself here to one example of this divining power:--By his\r\n    most ingenious device of a rapidly rotating mirror, Wheatstone\r\n    had proved that electricity required time to pass through\r\n    a wire, the current reaching the middle of the wire later\r\n    than its two ends. “If,” says Faraday, “the two ends of the\r\n    wire in Professor Wheatstone’s experiments were immediately\r\n    connected with two large insulated metallic surfaces exposed\r\n    to the air, so that the primary act of induction, after\r\n    making the contact for discharge, might be in part removed\r\n    from the internal portion of the wire at the first instance,\r\n    and disposed for the moment on its surface jointly with the\r\n    air and surrounding conductors, then I venture to anticipate\r\n    that the middle spark would be more retarded than before. And\r\n    if those two plates were the inner and outer coatings of a\r\n    large jar or Leyden battery, then the retardation of the spark\r\n    would be much greater.” This was only a _prediction_, for the\r\n    experiment was not made. Sixteen years subsequently, however,\r\n    the proper conditions came into play, and Faraday was able to\r\n    show that the observations of Werner Siemens and Latimer Clark\r\n    on subterraneous and submarine wires were illustrations, on a\r\n    grand scale, of the principle which he had enunciated in 1838.\r\n    The wires and the surrounding water act as a Leyden jar, and\r\n    the retardation of the current predicted by Faraday manifests\r\n    itself in every message sent by such cables.\r\n\r\n    The meaning of Faraday in these memoirs on induction and\r\n    conduction is, as I have said, by no means always clear;\r\n    and the difficulty will be most felt by those who are best\r\n    trained in ordinary theoretic conceptions. He does not know\r\n    the reader’s needs, and he therefore does not meet them. For\r\n    instance, he speaks over and over again of the impossibility\r\n    of charging a body with one electricity, though the\r\n    impossibility is by no means evident. The key to the difficulty\r\n    is this. He looks upon every insulated conductor as the inner\r\n    coating of a Leyden jar. An insulated sphere in the middle of\r\n    a room is to his mind such a coating; the walls are the outer\r\n    coating, while the air between both is the insulator, across\r\n    which the charge acts by induction. Without this reaction of\r\n    the walls upon the sphere, you could no more, according to\r\n    Faraday, charge it with electricity than you could charge a\r\n    Leyden jar, if its outer coating were removed. Distance with\r\n    him is immaterial. His strength as a generaliser enables him\r\n    to dissolve the idea of magnitude; and if you abolish the\r\n    walls of the room--even the earth itself--he would make the\r\n    sun and planets the outer coating of his jar. I dare not\r\n    contend that Faraday in these memoirs made all these theoretic\r\n    positions good. But a pure vein of philosophy runs through\r\n    these writings; while his experiments and reasonings on the\r\n    forms and phenomena of electrical discharge are of imperishable\r\n    importance.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the twelfth memoir, not included in the above\r\nsummary, Faraday deals with the disruptive discharge, and with the\r\nnature of the spark under varying conditions. This is continued on into\r\nthe thirteenth memoir, read February, 1838, and is extended to the\r\ncases of “brush” and “glow” discharges. He discovered the existence of\r\nthe very remarkable phenomenon of the “dark” discharge near the cathode\r\nin rarefied air. He sought to correlate _all_ the various forms of\r\ndischarge, as showing the essential nature of an electric current. “If\r\na ball be electrified positively,” he says, “in the middle of a room,\r\nand be then moved in any direction, effects will be produced, as if\r\na _current_ in the same direction (to use the conventional mode of\r\nexpression) had existed.” This is the theory of convection currents\r\nlater adopted by Maxwell, and verified by experiment by Rowland in 1876.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COINAGE OF NEW WORDS.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of this research on induction, Faraday had, as we have\r\nseen, been compelled to adopt new ideas, and therefore to adopt new\r\nnames to denote them. The term _dielectric_ for the medium in or across\r\nwhich the electric forces operate was one of these. As in previous\r\ncases, he consulted with his friends as to suitable terms. In this\r\ninstance the following letter from Whewell explains itself. The letter\r\nto which it is a reply has not been preserved, but the reference to\r\nFaraday’s objection to the word _current_ may be elucidated by a\r\ncomparison with what Faraday wrote in criticism of that word on pages\r\n146 and 212.\r\n\r\n    [_Rev. W. Whewell to M. Faraday._]\r\n\r\n                              TRIN. COLL., CAMBRIDGE, _Oct. 14, 1837_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,--I am always glad to hear of the progress of\r\n    your researches, and never the less so because they require\r\n    the fabrication of a new word or two. Such a coinage has\r\n    always taken place at the great epochs of discovery; like the\r\n    medals that are struck at the beginning of a new reign:--or\r\n    rather like the change of currency produced by the accession\r\n    of a new sovereign; for their value and influence consists in\r\n    their coming into common circulation. I am not sure that I\r\n    understand the views which you are at present bringing into\r\n    shape sufficiently well to suggest any such terms as you think\r\n    you want. I think that if I could have a quarter of an hour’s\r\n    talk with you I should probably be able to construct terms\r\n    that would record your new notions, so far as I could be made\r\n    to understand them better than I can by means of letters: for\r\n    it is difficult without question and discussion to catch the\r\n    precise kind of relation which you want to express. However,\r\n    by way of beginning such a discussion, I would ask you whether\r\n    you want abstract terms to denote the different and related\r\n    conditions of the body which exercises and the body which\r\n    suffers induction? For though both are active and both passive\r\n    it may still be convenient to suppose a certain ascendancy on\r\n    one side. If so would two such words as _inductricity_ and\r\n    _inducteity_ answer your purpose? They are not very monstrous\r\n    in their form; and are sufficiently distinct. And if you\r\n    want the corresponding adjectives you may call the one the\r\n    _inductric_, and the other the _inducteous_ body. This last\r\n    word is rather a startling one; but if such relations are to\r\n    be expressed, terminations are a good artifice, as we see in\r\n    chemistry: and I have no doubt if you give the world facts\r\n    and laws which are better expressed with than without such\r\n    solecisms, they will soon accommodate to the phrases, as they\r\n    have often done to worse ones. But I am rather in the dark\r\n    as to whether this is the kind of relation which you want to\r\n    indicate. If not, the attempt may perhaps serve to shew you\r\n    where my dulness lies. I do not see my way any better as to the\r\n    other terms, for I do not catch your objection to _current_,\r\n    which appears to me to be capable of jogging on very well\r\n    from _cathode_ to _anode_, or vice versa. As for positive and\r\n    negative, I do not see why _cathodic_ and _anodic_ should not\r\n    be used, if they will do the service you want of them.\r\n\r\n    I expect to be in London at the end of the month, and could\r\n    probably see you for half an hour on the 1st of November, say\r\n    at 10, 11, or 12. But in the mean time I shall be glad to hear\r\n    from you whether you can make anything of such conundrums as I\r\n    have mentioned, and am always yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                        W. WHEWELL.\r\n\r\n  M. FARADAY Esq^{re.}\r\n      Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LATERAL ACTIONS OF CURRENT.]\r\n\r\nThe concluding part of the thirteenth memoir, in which these new\r\nterms are used, is an exceedingly striking speculation on the lateral\r\nor transverse effects of the current. In calling special attention\r\nto them, he says: “I refer of course to the magnetic action and its\r\nrelations; but though this is the only recognised lateral action of\r\nthe current, there is great reason for believing that others exist and\r\nwould by their discovery reward a close search for them.” He seems to\r\nhave had an instinctive perception of something that eluded his grasp.\r\nNot until after Maxwell had given mathematical form to Faraday’s own\r\nsuggestions was this vision to be realised. He is dimly aware that\r\nthere appears to be a lateral tension or repulsion possessed by the\r\nlines of electric inductive action; and onward runs his thought in free\r\nspeculation:--\r\n\r\n    When current or discharge occurs between two bodies, previously\r\n    under inductrical relations to each other, the lines of\r\n    inductive force will weaken and fade away, and, as their\r\n    lateral repulsive tension diminishes, will contract and\r\n    ultimately disappear in the line of discharge. May not this be\r\n    an effect identical with the attractions of similar currents?\r\n    _i.e._ may not the passage of static electricity into current\r\n    electricity, and that of the lateral tension of the lines of\r\n    the inductive force into the lateral attraction of lines of\r\n    similar discharge, have the same relation and dependences, and\r\n    run parallel to each other?\r\n\r\nSeries fourteen of the memoirs is on the nature of the electric\r\nforce and on the relation of the electric and magnetic forces, and\r\ncomprises an inconclusive inquiry as to a possible relation between\r\nspecific inductive capacity and axes of crystallisation in crystalline\r\ndielectrics--a relation later assumed as true by Maxwell even before\r\nit was demonstrated by Von Boltzmann. In this memoir, too, occurs a\r\ndescription of a simple but effective induction balance. Then he asks\r\nwhat happens to insulating substances, such as air or sulphur, when\r\nthey are put in a place where the magnetic forces are varying; they\r\nought, he thinks, to undergo some state or condition corresponding\r\nto the state that causes currents in metals and conductors, and,\r\nfurther, that state ought to be one of _tension_. “I have,” he says,\r\n“by rotating non-conducting bodies near magnetic poles, and poles near\r\nthem, and also by causing powerful electric currents to be suddenly\r\nformed and to cease around and about insulators in various directions,\r\nendeavoured to make some such state sensible, but have not succeeded.”\r\nIn short, he was looking for direct evidence of the existence of what\r\nMaxwell called “displacement currents”--evidence which was later found\r\nindependently by the author and by Röntgen. And, again, there rises in\r\nhis mind a perception of that _electrotonic state_ which had haunted\r\nhis earlier researches as a something imposed upon the surrounding\r\nmedium during the growth or dying of an electric current.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INCESSANT ACTIVITIES.]\r\n\r\nIn these years (1835–1838) Faraday was still indefatigable in his\r\nlecture duties. In 1835 he gave four Friday discourses, and in May\r\nand June eight afternoon lectures at the Royal Institution on the\r\nmetals; also a course of fourteen lectures on electricity to the\r\nmedical students at St. George’s Hospital. In 1836 he published\r\nin the _Philosophical Magazine_ a paper on the magnetism of the\r\nmetals--notable as containing the still unverified speculation that all\r\nmetals would become magnetic in the same way as iron if only cooled to\r\na sufficiently low temperature--and three other papers, including one\r\non the “passive” state of iron. He gave four Friday discourses and six\r\nafternoon lectures on heat. In 1837 also four Friday night discourses\r\nand six afternoon lectures were delivered. In 1838 three Friday\r\ndiscourses and eight afternoon lectures on electricity, ending in June\r\nwith a distinct enunciation of the doctrine of the transformations of\r\n“force” (_i.e._ energy) and its indestructibility, afforded evidence of\r\nhis industry in this respect. At the same time he was giving scientific\r\nadvice to the authorities of Trinity House as to their lighthouses.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory notebook for March to August, 1838, shows a long\r\nresearch, occupying nearly 100 folio pages, on the relation of specific\r\ninductive capacity to crystalline structure. This is followed by some\r\nexperiments upon an electric eel, at the Royal Adelaide Gallery,\r\nwith some unpublished sketches of the distribution in the water of\r\nthe currents it emits. He proved, with great satisfaction, that the\r\ncurrents it gave were capable of producing magnetic effects, sparks,\r\nand chemical decomposition. These observations were embodied in the\r\nfifteenth series of memoirs.\r\n\r\nOne entry in the laboratory book, of date April 5th, 1838, is of great\r\ninterest, as showing how his mind ever recurred to the possibility of\r\nfinding a connection between optical and electric phenomena: “Must\r\ntry polarized light across a crystalline dielectric under charge. Good\r\nreasons perhaps now evident why a non-crystalline dielectric should\r\nhave no effect.”\r\n\r\nFaraday was now feeling greatly the strain of all these years of work,\r\nand in 1839 did little research until the autumn. Then he returned to\r\nthe question of the origin of the electromotive force of the voltaic\r\ncell, and by the end of the year completed two long papers on this\r\nvexed question; they formed the sixteenth and seventeenth series, and\r\nconclude the memoirs of this second period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CONTACT THEORY OF ELECTRICITY.]\r\n\r\nIn the eighth series, completed in April, 1834, on the “Electricity of\r\nthe Voltaic Pile,” Faraday had dealt with the question--at that time a\r\ntopic of excited controversy--of the origin of the electromotive force\r\nin a cell, Volta, who knew nothing of the chemical actions, ascribed\r\nit to the contact of dissimilar metals, whilst Wollaston, Becquerel,\r\nand De la Rive considered it the result of chemical actions. The\r\ncontroversy has long ceased to interest the scientific world; for,\r\nwith the recognition of the principle of the conservation of energy,\r\nit became evident that mere contact cannot provide a continuing supply\r\nof energy. It would now be altogether dead but for the survival of a\r\nbelief in the contact theory on the part of one of the most honoured\r\nveterans in science. But in the years 1834 to 1840 it was of absorbing\r\ninterest. Faraday’s work quietly removed the props which supported the\r\nolder theory, and it crumbled away. He found that the chemical and\r\nelectrical effects in the cell were proportional one to the other, and\r\ninseparable. He discovered a way of making a cell without any metallic\r\ncontacts. He showed that without chemical action there was no current\r\nproduced. But his results were ignored for the time. After six years\r\nFaraday reopened the question. Again the admirable summary of Professor\r\nTyndall is drawn upon for the following account:--\r\n\r\n    The memoir on the “Electricity of the Voltaic Pile,” published\r\n    in 1834, appears to have produced but little impression upon\r\n    the supporters of the contact theory. These indeed were men\r\n    of too great intellectual weight and insight lightly to take\r\n    up, or lightly to abandon, a theory. Faraday therefore resumed\r\n    the attack in two papers communicated to the Royal Society on\r\n    February 6 and March 19, 1840. In these papers he hampered\r\n    his antagonists by a crowd of adverse experiments. He hung\r\n    difficulty after difficulty about the neck of the contact\r\n    theory, until in its efforts to escape from his assaults it so\r\n    changed its character as to become a thing totally different\r\n    from the theory proposed by Volta. The more persistently it was\r\n    defended, however, the more clearly did it show itself to be\r\n    a congeries of devices, bearing the stamp of dialectic skill\r\n    rather than that of natural truth.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, Faraday brought to bear upon it an argument\r\n    which, had its full weight and purport been understood at\r\n    the time, would have instantly decided the controversy. “The\r\n    contact theory,” he urged, “assumes that a force which is able\r\n    to overcome powerful resistance, as for instance that of the\r\n    conductors, good or bad, through which the current passes,\r\n    and that again of the electrolytic action where bodies are\r\n    decomposed by it, _can arise out of nothing_; that without\r\n    any change in the acting matter, or the consumption of any\r\n    generating force, a current shall be produced which shall go\r\n    on for ever against a constant resistance, or only be stopped,\r\n    as in the voltaic trough, by the ruins which its exertion has\r\n    heaped up in its own course. This would indeed be _a creation\r\n    of power_, and is like no other force in nature. We have many\r\n    processes by which the _form_ of the power may be so changed,\r\n    that an apparent _conversion_ of one into the other takes\r\n    place. So we can change chemical force into the electric\r\n    current, or the current into chemical force. The beautiful\r\n    experiments of Seebeck and Peltier show the convertibility of\r\n    heat and electricity; and others by Oersted and myself show\r\n    the convertibility of electricity and magnetism. _But in no\r\n    case, not even in those of the gymnotus and torpedo, is there a\r\n    pure creation or a production of power without a corresponding\r\n    exhaustion of something to supply it._”\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Faraday gave five Friday discourses and a course of eight\r\nafternoon lectures on the non-metallic elements. In 1840 he gave\r\nthree Friday discourses and seven lectures on chemical affinity. But\r\nin the summer came the serious breakdown alluded to on page 75. He\r\ndid no experimental work after September 14th, nor indeed for nearly\r\ntwo years. Even then it was only a temporary return to research to\r\ninvestigate the source of the electrification produced by steam in the\r\nremarkable experiments of Mr. (afterwards Lord) Armstrong. He proved it\r\nto be due to friction. This done, he continued to rest from research\r\nuntil the middle of 1844, though he lectured a little for the Royal\r\nInstitution. In 1841 he gave the juvenile lectures. In 1842 he gave\r\ntwo Friday discourses, one of them being on the lateral discharge in\r\nlightning-rods. He also gave the Christmas lectures on electricity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: END OF SECOND ACTIVE PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nIn 1843 he gave three Friday discourses, one of which was on the\r\nelectricity generated by a jet of steam; and repeated the eight\r\nafternoon lectures he had given in 1838. In 1844 he gave eight lectures\r\non heat and two Friday discourses. He also resumed research on the\r\ncondensation of gases, and vainly tried to liquefy oxygen and hydrogen,\r\nthough he succeeded with ammonia and nitrous oxide.\r\n\r\nDuring these years of rest he also did a little work for Trinity House,\r\nchiefly concerning lighthouses and their ventilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES: THIRD PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the fruitful ten years of Faraday’s middle period two\r\nmagistral ideas had slowly grown up in his mind, and as he let his\r\nthought play about the objects of his daily activities, these ideas\r\npossessed and dominated him as no newly suggested idea could have done.\r\nThey were the correlation and inter-convertibility of the forces of\r\nnature, and the optical relations of magnetism and electricity.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of enforced rest, from 1839 to 1844, these ideas had\r\nbeen ever with him. His was a mind which during times of quiet brooding\r\ndid not cease to advance. In silence his thoughts arranged themselves\r\nin readiness for the next period of activity, and his work, when it\r\nbegan again, was all the more fruitful for the antecedent period of\r\ncogitation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OPTICAL ANALYSIS.]\r\n\r\nOn August 30th, 1845, Faraday for the sixth time set to work in his\r\nlaboratory to search for the connection between light and electricity\r\nfor which he had so often looked, and about which he had so boldly\r\nspeculated. He began by looking for some effect to be produced on\r\npolarised light by passing it through a liquid which was undergoing\r\nelectrolysis. What effect precisely he expected to observe is unknown.\r\nDoubtless he had an open mind to perceive effects of any kind had such\r\noccurred. Earlier in the century the phenomena of polarised light had\r\nbeen worked out in great detail, through a host of beautiful phenomena,\r\nby Arago, Biot, Brewster, and others; and their discoveries had shown\r\nthat this agent is capable of revealing in transparent substances\r\ndetails of structure which otherwise would be quite invisible. Placed\r\nbetween two Nicol prisms or two slices of tourmaline, to serve\r\nrespectively as “polariser” and “analyser,” thin sheets of transparent\r\ncrystal--selenite or mica--were made to reveal the fact that they\r\npossessed an axis of maximum elasticity. For when the analyser and\r\npolariser were set in the “crossed” position, where the one would cut\r\noff all the luminous vibrations that the other would transmit, no light\r\nwould be visible to the observer, unless in the intervening space there\r\nwere interposed some substance endowed with one of two properties,\r\neither that of resolving some part of the vibrations into an oblique\r\ndirection or else that of rotating the plane of the vibrations to right\r\nor to left. If either of these things is done, light appears through\r\nthe analyser. It is thus that structure is observed in horn and in\r\nstarch grains. It is thus that the strains in a piece of compressed\r\nglass are made visible. It is thus that crystalline structures\r\ngenerally can be studied. It is thus that the discovery was made of the\r\nsubstances which possess the strange property of twisting or rotating\r\nthe plane of polarisation of light--namely, quartz crystal, solutions\r\nof sugar and of certain alkaloids, and certain other liquids, such\r\nas turpentine. Such was the agent which Faraday proposed to employ to\r\ndetect whether electric forces impress any quality resembling that of\r\n_structure_ upon transparent materials.\r\n\r\nThe notes begin with the words:--\r\n\r\n“I have had a glass trough made 24 inches long, 1 inch wide and\r\nabout 1½ deep, in which to decompose electrolites and, whilst under\r\ndecomposition, along which I could pass a ray of light in different\r\nconditions and afterwards examine it.”\r\n\r\nHe put into this trough two platinum electrodes and a solution of\r\nsulphate of soda, but could find no effects. Eight pages of the\r\nnotebook are filled with details all leading to negative results. For\r\nten days he worked at these experiments with liquid electrolytes.\r\nThe substances used were distilled water, solution of sugar, dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, solution of sulphate of soda (using platinum\r\nelectrodes), and solution of sulphate of copper (using copper\r\nelectrodes). The current was sent along the ray, and perpendicular\r\nto it in two directions at right angles with each other. The ray\r\nwas made to rotate, by altering the position of the polariser (in\r\nthis case a black-glass mirror at the proper angle), so that the\r\nplane of polarisation might be varied. The current was used as a\r\ncontinuous current, as a rapidly intermitting current, and as a rapidly\r\nalternating induction current; _but in no case was any trace of action\r\nperceived_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DIFFICULT RESEARCH.]\r\n\r\nThen he turned to solid dielectrics to see if under electric strain\r\nthey would yield any optical effect. He had indeed so far back as\r\n1838 tried the experiment of coating two opposite faces of a glass\r\ncube with metal foil plates that were then electrified by a powerful\r\nelectric machine. But the experiment had no result. This experiment\r\nhe now repeats with a score of elaborate variations, trying both\r\ncrystalline and non-crystalline dielectrics. Rock-crystal, Iceland\r\nspar, flint glass, heavy-glass, turpentine, and air, had a beam of\r\npolarised light passed through them, and at the same time “lines of\r\nelectrostatic tension” were, by means of the coatings, Leyden jars,\r\nand the electric machine, directed across these bodies, both parallel\r\nto the polarised ray and across it, both in and across the plane of\r\npolarisation; but again without any visible effect. Then he tries on\r\nthe same bodies, and on water, the “tension” of a rapidly alternating\r\ninduced current, but still with the same negative result. Professor\r\nTyndall stated that from conversation with Faraday, and with his\r\nfaithful assistant Anderson, he inferred that the labour expended on\r\nthis preliminary and apparently fruitless research was very great.\r\nIt occupies many pages of the laboratory notebook. That thirty-two\r\nyears later Dr. Kerr succeeded in finding this optical effect of\r\nelectrostatic strain for which Faraday vainly sought, is no reflection\r\nupon Faraday’s powers of observation. Had there been no Faraday there\r\nhad doubtless been no discovery by Kerr.\r\n\r\nSo far the quest had been carried on either with electric currents\r\nflowing through the transparent substance or else with mere statical\r\nelectric forces, and a whole fortnight had been spent without result.\r\nNow another track is taken, and it leads straight to success. He\r\nsubstitutes magnetic for electric forces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAGNETO-OPTIC DISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\n“13th Sept. 1845.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n“To-day worked with lines of magnetic force, passing them across\r\ndifferent bodies transparent in different directions, and at the same\r\ntime passing a polarized ray of light through them, and afterwards\r\nexamining the ray by a Nichol’s Eye-piece or other means. The magnets\r\nwere Electro-magnets one being our large cylinder Electro-magnet and\r\nthe other a temporary iron core put into the helix on a frame. This was\r\nnot nearly so strong as the former. The current of 5 cells of Grove’s\r\nbattery was sent through both helices at once and the magnets were\r\nmade and unmade by putting in or stopping off the electric current.”\r\nAir, flint-glass, rock-crystal, calcareous spar, were examined, but\r\nwithout effect. And so he worked on through the morning, trying first\r\none specimen, then another, altering the directions of the poles of\r\nhis magnets, reversing their polarity, changing the position of his\r\noptical apparatus, increasing the battery-power of his magnetising\r\ncurrent. Then he bethinks him of that “heavy-glass”--the boro-silicate\r\nof lead--which had cost him nearly four years of precious labour during\r\nthe first period of his scientific life. The entry in the notebook is\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\n“A piece of heavy glass, which was 2 inches by 1·8 inches and 0·5 of\r\nan inch thick, being a silico-borate of lead, was experimented with.\r\nIt gave no effects when the _same magnetic poles_ or the _contrary_\r\npoles were on opposite sides (as respects the course of the polarised\r\nray);--nor when the same poles were on the same side either with the\r\nconstant or intermitting current; =BUT= when contrary magnetic poles\r\nwere on the same side there _was an effect produced on the polarised\r\nray_, and thus magnetic force and light were proved to have relations\r\nto each other. This fact will most likely prove exceedingly fertile,\r\nand of great value in the investigation of conditions of natural force.\r\n\r\n“The effect was of this kind. The glass, a result of one of my old\r\nexperiments on optical glass, had been exceedingly well annealed\r\nso that it did not in any degree affect the polarized ray. The two\r\nmagnetic poles were in a horizontal plane, and the piece of glass put\r\nup flat against them so that the polarized ray could pass through its\r\nedges and be examined by the eye at a Nicholl’s eye piece. In its\r\nnatural state the glass had no effect on the polarized ray but on\r\nmaking contact at the battery so as to render the cores N and S magnets\r\ninstantly the glass acquired a certain degree of _power of depolarizing\r\nthe ray_ which it retained steadily as long as the cores were magnets\r\nbut which it lost the instant the electric current was stopped. Hence\r\nit was a permanent condition and as was expected did not sensibly\r\nappear with an intermitting current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n“The effect was not influenced by any jogging motion or any moderate\r\npressure of the hands on the glass.\r\n\r\n“The heavy glass had tinfoil coatings on its two sides but when these\r\nwere taken off the effect remained exactly the same.\r\n\r\n“A mass of soft iron on the outside of the _heavy glass_ greatly\r\n_diminished_ the effect [see Fig. 17]....\r\n\r\n“All this shews that it is when the _polarized ray_ passes _parallel_\r\nto the _lines of magnetic induction_ or rather to the _direction of\r\nthe magnetic curves_, that the glass manifests its power of affecting\r\nthe ray. So that the heavy glass in its magnetized state corresponds to\r\nthe cube of rock crystal: the direction of the magnetic curves in the\r\npiece of glass corresponding to the direction of the optic axis in the\r\ncrystal (see Exp. Researches 1689–1698)....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n“Employed our large _ring electro-magnet_ which is very powerful and\r\nhas of course the poles in the right [position] only they are very\r\nclose not more than [0·5] of an inch apart. When the _heavy glass_ was\r\nput up against it the effect was produced better than in any former\r\ncase....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENOUGH FOR TO-DAY.]\r\n\r\n“Have got enough for to-day.”\r\n\r\nThe description which he published in the “Researches” of the first\r\nsuccessful experiment is as follows:--\r\n\r\n“A piece of this glass about 2 inches square and 0·5 of an inch thick,\r\nhaving flat and polished edges, was placed as a _diamagnetic_[47]\r\nbetween the poles (not as yet magnetized by the electric current),\r\nso that the polarized ray should pass through its length; the glass\r\nacted as air, water, or any other indifferent substance would do; and\r\nif the eye-piece [_i.e._ analyzer] were previously turned into such a\r\nposition that the polarized ray was extinguished, or rather the image\r\nproduced by it rendered invisible, then the introduction of this glass\r\nmade no alteration in that respect. In this state of circumstances\r\nthe force of the electromagnet was developed, by sending an electric\r\ncurrent through its coils, and immediately the image of the lamp-flame\r\nbecame visible, and continued so as long as the arrangement continued\r\nmagnetic. On stopping the electric current, and so causing the magnetic\r\nforce to cease, the light instantly disappeared; these phænomena could\r\nbe renewed at pleasure, at any instant of time, and upon any occasion,\r\nshowing a perfect dependence of cause and effect.”\r\n\r\nHe paused for four days in order to procure more powerful\r\nelectromagnets, for the effect which he had observed was exceedingly\r\nslight: “A person looking for the phænomenon for the first time would\r\nnot be able to see it with a weak magnet.”\r\n\r\nThe entry in the notebook begins again:--\r\n\r\n“18th Sept. 1845.\r\n\r\n“Have now borrowed and received the Woolwich magnet.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN EXCELLENT DAY’S WORK.]\r\n\r\nThis was a more powerful electromagnet than that at the Institution.\r\nWith this he sets to work with such energy that twelve pages of the\r\nlaboratory book are filled in one day. His thoughts had ripened during\r\nthe five days, and he advanced rapidly from point to point. The first\r\nexperiment with the Woolwich magnet brings out another point, of which\r\nat once he grasped the significance:--\r\n\r\n“Heavy Glass (original, or 174[48]) when placed thus produced a very\r\nfine effect. The brightness of the image produced rose gradually not\r\ninstantly, due to this that the iron cores do not take their full\r\nintensity of magnetic state at once but require time, and so the\r\nmagnetic curves rise in intensity. In this way the effect is one by\r\nwhich an optical examination of the electromagnet can be made--and the\r\ntime necessary clearly shewn.”\r\n\r\nHe next ascertains definitely that the phenomenon is one of rotatory\r\npolarisation--that is to say, the action of the magnet is to twist and\r\nrotate the plane of polarisation through a definite angle depending on\r\nthe strength of the magnet and the direction of the exciting current.\r\nHe finds the direction of the rotation, and verifies it by comparison\r\nwith the ordinary optical rotation produced by turpentine and by a\r\nsolution of sugar, winding up with the words:--\r\n\r\n“_An excellent day’s work._”\r\n\r\nFor four days he went on accumulating proofs, and now succeeding with\r\nthe very substances with which he formerly failed. On September 26th\r\nhe tried the conjoint effect of a magnetic and an electric field.\r\nHe also tried the effect of a current running along a transparent\r\nliquid electrolytically whilst the magnet was in operation. The only\r\nresults appeared to be those due to the magnet alone. For six days in\r\nOctober the experiments were continued. He noted, as a desideratum, a\r\ntransparent oxide of iron. “With some degree of curiosity and hope” he\r\n“put gold leaf into the magnetic lines, but could perceive no effect.”\r\nHe was instinctively looking for the phenomenon which Kundt later\r\ndiscovered as a property of thin transparent films of iron. He entered\r\namongst the speculative suggestions in his notebook the query: “Does\r\nthis [magnetic] force tend to make iron and oxide of iron transparent?”\r\nOn October 3rd he tried experiments on light reflected from the surface\r\nof metals placed in the magnetic field. He indeed obtained an optical\r\nrotation by reflection at the surface of a polished steel button, but\r\nthe results were inconclusive owing to imperfection of the surface. It\r\nwas reserved for Dr. Kerr to rediscover and follow up this effect. On\r\nOctober 6th he looked for mechanical and magnetic effects on pieces\r\nof heavy-glass and on liquids in glass bulbs placed between the poles\r\nof his magnet, but found none. He also looked for possible effects of\r\nrapid motion given to the diamagnetic while jointly subject to the\r\naction of magnetism and the light, but found none.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: UNFULFILLED EXPECTATIONS.]\r\n\r\nOn October 11th he thinks he has got hold of another new fact when\r\nexperimenting on liquids in a long glass tube, the record of it\r\nfilling three pages. But two days afterwards he finds it only a\r\ndisturbing effect due to the communication of heat to the liquid\r\nfrom the surrounding magnetising coil. He seems to regret the loss\r\nof the new fact, but adds: “As to the other phenomenon of circular\r\npolarization, that comes out constant, clear, and beautiful.”\r\n\r\nThen, with that idea of the correlation of forces always in his\r\nhead, there recurs to him the notion that if magnetism or electric\r\ncurrents can affect a beam of light, there must be some sort of\r\nconverse phenomenon, and that in some way or other light must be able\r\nto electrify or to magnetise. Thirty-one years before, when visiting\r\nRome with Davy, he had witnessed the experiments of Morichini on the\r\nalleged magnetic effect of violet light, and had remained unconvinced.\r\nHis own idea is very different. And October 14th being a bright day\r\nwith good sunlight, he makes the attempt. Selecting a very sensitive\r\ngalvanometer, he connects it to a spiral of wire 1 inch in diameter,\r\n4·2 inches long, of 56 convolutions, and then directs a beam of\r\nsunlight along its axis. He tries letting the beam pass alternately\r\nthrough the coil while the outside is covered, and then along the\r\nexterior while the interior is shaded. But still there is no effect.\r\nThen he inserts an unmagnetised steel bar within the coil, and rotates\r\nit while it is exposed to the sun’s rays. Still there is no effect,\r\nand the sun goes down on another of the unfulfilled expectations. But\r\nhad he lived to learn of the effect of light in altering the electric\r\nresistance of selenium discovered by Mayhew, of the photoelectric\r\ncurrents discovered by Becquerel, of the discharging action of\r\nultra-violet light discovered by Hertz, of the revivifying effect of\r\nlight on recently demagnetised iron discovered by Bidwell, he would\r\nhave rejoiced that such other correlations should have been found,\r\nthough different from that which he sought. On November 3rd he receives\r\na new horseshoe magnet, with which he hoped to find some optical effect\r\non air and other gases, but again without result. That the magnetism of\r\nthe earth does actually rotate the plane of polarisation of sky light\r\nwas the discovery of Henri Becquerel so late as 1878.\r\n\r\nFaithful to his own maxim: “Work, finish, publish,” Faraday lost no\r\ntime in writing out his research. It was presented to the Royal Society\r\non November 6th, but the main result was verbally mentioned on November\r\n3rd at the monthly meeting of the Royal Institution, and reported in\r\nthe _Athenæum_ of November 8th, 1845.\r\n\r\nBut even before the memoir was thus given to the world another\r\ndiscovery had been made. For on November 4th with the new magnet he\r\nrepeated an experiment which a month previously had been without\r\nresult. So preoccupied was he over the new event that he did not even\r\ngo to the meeting of the Royal Society on November 20th, when his paper\r\non the “Action of Magnets on Light” was read. What that new discovery\r\nwas is well told by Faraday himself in the letter which he sent to\r\nProfessor A. de la Rive on December 4th:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRESH MAGNETIC DISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\n    [_Faraday to Professor Aug. de la Rive._]\r\n\r\n                                        Brighton, December 4, 1845.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIEND,-- * * * I count upon you as one of those whose\r\n    free hearts have pleasure in my success, and I am very grateful\r\n    to you for it. I have had your last letter by me on my desk\r\n    for several weeks, intending to answer it; but absolutely I\r\n    have not been able, for of late I have shut myself up in my\r\n    laboratory and wrought, to the exclusion of everything else. I\r\n    heard afterwards that even your brother had called on one of\r\n    these days and been excluded.\r\n\r\n    Well, a part of this result is that which you have heard,\r\n    and my paper was read to the Royal Society, I believe, last\r\n    Thursday, for I was not there; and I also understand there have\r\n    been notices in the _Athenæum_, but I have not had time to see\r\n    them, and I do not know how they are done. However, I can refer\r\n    you to the _Times_ of last Saturday (November 29th) for a very\r\n    good abstract of the paper. I do not know who put it in, but it\r\n    is well done, though brief. To that account, therefore, I will\r\n    refer you.\r\n\r\n    For I am still so involved in discovery that I have hardly\r\n    time for my meals, and am here at Brighton both to refresh\r\n    and work my head at once, and I feel that unless I had been\r\n    here, and been careful, I could not have continued my labours.\r\n    The consequence has been that last Monday I announced to our\r\n    members at the Royal Institution another discovery, of which I\r\n    will give you the pith in a few words. The paper will go to the\r\n    Royal Society next week, and probably be read as shortly after\r\n    as they can there find it convenient.\r\n\r\n    Many years ago I worked upon optical glass, and made a vitreous\r\n    compound of silica, boracic acid, and lead, which I will\r\n    now call heavy glass, and which Amici uses in some of his\r\n    microscopes; and it was this substance which enabled me first\r\n    to act on light by magnetic and electric forces. Now, if a\r\n    square bar of this substance, about half an inch thick and\r\n    two inches long, be very freely suspended between the poles\r\n    of a powerful horse-shoe electro-magnet, immediately that\r\n    the magnetic force is developed, the bar points; but it does\r\n    not point from pole to pole, but equatorially or across the\r\n    magnetic lines of force--_i.e._ east and west in respect of\r\n    the north and south poles. If it be moved from this position\r\n    it returns to it, and this continues as long as the magnetic\r\n    force is in action. This effect is the result of a still\r\n    simpler action of the magnet on the bar than what appears by\r\n    the experiment, and which may be obtained at a single magnetic\r\n    pole. For if a cubical or rounded piece of the glass be\r\n    suspended by a fine thread six or eight feet long, and allowed\r\n    to hang very near a strong magneto-electric pole (not as yet\r\n    made active), then on rendering the pole magnetic the glass\r\n    will be repelled, and continue repelled until the magnetism\r\n    ceases. This effect or power I have worked out through a great\r\n    number of its forms and strange consequences, and they will\r\n    occupy two series of the “Experimental Researches.” It belongs\r\n    to _all matter_ (not magnetic, as iron) without exception,\r\n    so that every substance belongs to the one or the other\r\n    class--magnetic or diamagnetic bodies. The law of action in\r\n    its simple form is that such matter tends to go from strong to\r\n    weak points of magnetic force, and in doing this the substance\r\n    will go in either direction along the magnetic curves, or in\r\n    either direction across them. It is curious that amongst the\r\n    metals are found bodies possessing this property in as high a\r\n    degree as perhaps any other substance. In fact, I do not know\r\n    at present whether heavy glass, or bismuth, or phosphorus is\r\n    the most striking in this respect. I have very little doubt\r\n    that you have an electro-magnet strong enough to enable you to\r\n    verify the chief facts of pointing equatorially and repulsion,\r\n    if you will use bismuth carefully examined as to its freedom\r\n    from magnetism, and making of it a bar an inch and a half long,\r\n    and one-third or one-fourth of an inch wide. Let me, however,\r\n    ask the favour of your keeping this fact to yourself for two\r\n    or three weeks, and preserving the date of this letter as a\r\n    record. I ought (in order to preserve the respect due to the\r\n    Royal Society) not to write a description to anyone until the\r\n    paper has been received or even read there. After three weeks\r\n    or a month I think you may use it, guarding, as I am sure you\r\n    will do, my right. And now, my dear friend, I must conclude,\r\n    and hasten to work again. But first give my kindest respects to\r\n    Madame de la Rive, and many thanks to your brother for his call.\r\n\r\n    Ever your obedient and affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAGNETIC EXPERIMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of diamagnetism which Faraday thus announced was in\r\nitself a notable achievement. As Tyndall points out, the discovery\r\nitself was in all probability due to Faraday’s habit of not regarding\r\nas final any negative result of an experiment until he had brought to\r\nbear upon it the most powerful resources at his command. He had tried\r\nthe effects of ordinary magnets on brass and copper and other materials\r\ncommonly considered as non-magnetic. But when, for the purpose of\r\nthe preceding research on the relation of magnetism to light, he had\r\ndeliberately procured electromagnets of unusual power, he again tried\r\nwhat their effect might be upon non-magnetic stuffs. Suspending a piece\r\nof his heavy glass near the poles in a stirrup of writing-paper slung\r\nupon the end of a long thread of cocoon silk, he found it to experience\r\na strong mechanical action when the magnet was stimulated by turning on\r\nthe current. His precision of description is characteristic:--\r\n\r\n    I shall have such frequent occasion to refer to two chief\r\n    positions of position across the magnetic field, that, to\r\n    avoid periphrasis, I will here ask leave to use a term or two\r\n    conditionally. One of these directions is that from pole to\r\n    pole, or along the lines of magnetic force, I will call it the\r\n    axial direction; the other is the direction perpendicular to\r\n    this, and across the line of magnetic force and for the time,\r\n    and as respects the space between the poles, I will call it the\r\n    _equatorial_ direction.\r\n\r\nNote the occurrence in the above passage for the first time of the term\r\n“the magnetic field.” Faraday’s description of the discovery continues\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    The bar of silicated borate of lead or heavy glass already\r\n    described as the substance in which magnetic forces were first\r\n    made effectually to bear on a ray of light, and which is 2\r\n    inches long, and about 0·5 inch wide and thick, was suspended\r\n    centrally between the magnetic poles, and left until the effect\r\n    of torsion was over. The magnet was then thrown into action\r\n    by making contact at the voltaic battery. Immediately the bar\r\n    moved, turning round its point of suspension, into a position\r\n    across the magnetic curve or line of force, and, after a few\r\n    vibrations, took up its place of rest there. On being displaced\r\n    by hand from this position it returned to it, and this occurred\r\n    many times in succession.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n    Either end of the bar indifferently went to either side of the\r\n    axial line. The determining circumstance was simply inclination\r\n    of the bar one way or the other to the axial line at the\r\n    beginning of the experiment. If a particular or marked end of\r\n    the bar were on one side of the magnetic or axial line when\r\n    the magnet was rendered active, that end went further outwards\r\n    until the bar had taken up the equatorial position....\r\n\r\n    Here, then, we have a magnetic bar which points east and\r\n    west in relation to north and south poles--_i.e._ points\r\n    perpendicularly to the lines of magnetic force....\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: DIAMAGNETIC LAWS.]\r\n\r\n    To produce these effects of pointing across the magnetic\r\n    curves, the form of the heavy glass must be long. A cube or\r\n    a fragment approaching roundness in form will not point, but\r\n    a long piece will. Two or three rounded pieces or cubes,\r\n    placed side by side in a paper tray, so as to form an oblong\r\n    accumulation, will also point.\r\n\r\n    Portions, however, of any form are _repelled_; so if two pieces\r\n    be hung up at once in the axial line, one near each pole, they\r\n    are repelled by their respective poles, and approach, seeming\r\n    to attract each other. Or if two pieces be hung up in the\r\n    equatorial line, one on each side of the axis, then they both\r\n    recede from the axis, seeming to repel each other.\r\n\r\n    From the little that has been said, it is evident that the\r\n    bar presents in its motion a complicated result of the force\r\n    exerted by the magnetic power over the heavy glass, and that\r\n    when cubes or spheres are employed a much simpler indication of\r\n    the effect may be obtained. Accordingly, when a cube was thus\r\n    used with the two poles, the effect was repulsion or recession\r\n    from either pole, and also recession from the magnetic axis on\r\n    either side.\r\n\r\n    So the indicating particle would move either along the magnetic\r\n    curves or across them, and it would do this either in one\r\n    direction or the other, the only constant point being that its\r\n    tendency was to move from stronger to weaker places of magnetic\r\n    force.\r\n\r\n    This appeared much more simply in the case of a single magnetic\r\n    pole, for then the tendency of the indicating cube or sphere\r\n    was to move outwards in the direction of the magnetic lines\r\n    of force. The appearance was remarkably like a case of weak\r\n    electric repulsion.\r\n\r\n    The cause of the pointing of the bar, or any oblong arrangement\r\n    of the heavy glass, is now evident. It is merely a result of\r\n    the tendency of the particles to move outwards, or into the\r\n    positions of weakest magnetic action.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When the bar of heavy glass is immersed in water, alcohol,\r\n    or æther, contained in a vessel between the poles, all the\r\n    preceding effects occur--the bar points and the cube recedes\r\n    exactly in the same manner as in air.\r\n\r\n    The effects equally occur in vessels of wood, stone, earth,\r\n    copper, lead, silver, or any of those substances which belong\r\n    to the diamagnetic class.\r\n\r\n    I have obtained the same equatorial direction and motions of\r\n    the heavy glass bar as those just described, but in a very\r\n    feeble degree, by the use of a good common steel horseshoe\r\n    magnet.\r\n\r\nThen he goes on to enumerate the many bodies of all sorts: crystals,\r\npowders, liquids, acids, oils; organic bodies such as wax, olive-oil,\r\nwood, beef (fresh and dry), blood, apple, and bread, all of which were\r\nfound to be diamagnetic. On this he remarks:--\r\n\r\n    It is curious to see such a list as this of bodies presenting\r\n    on a sudden this remarkable property, and it is strange to find\r\n    a piece of wood, or beef, or apple, obedient to or repelled by\r\n    a magnet. If a man could be suspended with sufficient delicacy\r\n    after the manner of Dufay, and placed in the magnetic field, he\r\n    would point equatorially, for all the substances of which he is\r\n    formed, including the blood, possess this property.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MAGNETIC BRAKE.]\r\n\r\nA few bodies were found to be feebly magnetic, including paper,\r\nsealing-wax, china ink, asbestos, fluorspar, peroxide of lead,\r\ntourmaline, plumbago, and charcoal. As to the metals, he found iron,\r\ncobalt, and nickel to stand in a distinct class. A feeble magnetic\r\naction in platinum, palladium, and titanium was suspected to be due\r\nto traces of iron in them. Bismuth proved to be the most strongly\r\ndiamagnetic, and was specially studied. The repellent effect between\r\nbismuth and a magnet had indeed been casually observed twice in the\r\nprior history of science, first by Brugmans, then by Le Baillif.\r\nFaraday, with characteristic frankness, refers to his having a “vague\r\nimpression” that the repulsion of bismuth by a magnet had been\r\nobserved before, though unable at the time of writing to recollect any\r\nreference. His own experiments ran over the whole range of substances,\r\nhowever, and demonstrated the universal existence in greater or less\r\ndegree of this magnetic nature. Certain differences observed between\r\nthe behaviour of bismuth and of heavy glass on the one hand, and\r\nof copper on the other hand, though all are diamagnetic, led him\r\nto note and describe some of the pseudo-diamagnetic effects which\r\noccur in copper and silver, in consequence of the induction in them\r\nof eddy-currents, from which heavy-glass and bismuth are, by their\r\ninferior electric conductivity, comparatively free. He described the\r\nbeautiful and now classical experiment of arresting, by turning on the\r\nexciting current, the rotation of a copper cylinder spinning between\r\nthe poles of an electromagnet.\r\n\r\nFaraday continued to prosecute this newest line of research, and at\r\nthe end of December, 1845, presented another memoir (the twenty-first\r\nseries of the Experimental Researches) to the Royal Society. He had now\r\nexamined the salts of iron, and had found that every salt and compound\r\ncontaining iron in the basic part was magnetic, both in the solid\r\nand in the liquid state. Even prussian-blue and green bottle-glass\r\nwere magnetic. The solutions of the salts of iron were of special\r\nimportance, since they furnish the means of making a magnet which\r\nis for the time liquid, transparent, and, within certain limits,\r\nadjustable in strength. His next step was to examine how bodies\r\nbehaved when immersed in some surrounding medium. A weak solution of\r\niron, enclosed in a very thin glass tube, though it pointed axially\r\nwhen hung in air, pointed equatorially when immersed in a stronger\r\nsolution. A tube full of air pointed axially, and was attracted as\r\nif magnetic when surrounded with water. Substances such as bismuth,\r\ncopper, and phosphorus are, however, highly diamagnetic when suspended\r\n_in vacuo_. Such a view would make _mere space_ magnetic. Hence Faraday\r\ninclined at first to the opinion that diamagnetics had a specific\r\naction antithetically distinct from ordinary magnetic action. Several\r\ntimes he pointed out that all the phenomena resolve themselves simply\r\ninto this, that a portion of such matter as is termed diamagnetic\r\ntends to move from stronger to places or points of weaker force in\r\nthe magnetic field. He does, indeed, hazard the suggestion that the\r\nphenomena might be explained on the assumption that there was a sort of\r\ndiamagnetic polarity--that magnetic induction caused in them a contrary\r\nstate to that which it produced in ordinary magnetic matter. But his\r\nown experiments failed to support this view, and, in opposition to\r\nWeber and Tyndall, he maintained afterwards the non-polar nature of\r\ndiamagnetic action.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Faraday gave two Friday night discourses on these magnetic\r\nresearches, one on the cohesive force of water, and one on Wheatstone’s\r\nelectromagnetic chronoscope. At the conclusion of the last-named he\r\nsaid that he was induced to utter a speculation which had long been\r\ngaining strength in his mind, that perhaps those vibrations by which\r\nradiant energies, such as light, heat, actinic rays, etc., convey\r\ntheir force through space are not mere vibrations of an æther, but of\r\nthe lines of force which, in his view, connect different masses, and\r\nso was inclined, in his own phrase, “to dismiss the æther.” In one of\r\nhis other discourses he made the suggestion that we might “perhaps\r\nhereafter obtain magnetism from light.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THOUGHTS ON RAY VIBRATIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe speculation above referred to is of such intrinsic importance, in\r\nview of the developments of the last decade, that it compels further\r\nnotice. Faraday himself further expanded it in a letter to Richard\r\nPhillips, which was printed in the _Philosophical Magazine_ for May,\r\n1846, under the title “Thoughts on Ray-vibrations.” In this avowedly\r\nspeculative paper Faraday touched the highest point in his scientific\r\nwritings, and threw out, though in a tentative and fragmentary way,\r\nbrilliant hints of that which his imagination had perceived, as in\r\na vision;--the doctrine now known as the electromagnetic theory of\r\nlight. At the dates when the earlier biographies of Faraday appeared,\r\nneither that doctrine nor this paper had received the recognition due\r\nto its importance. Tyndall dismisses it as “one of the most singular\r\nspeculations that ever emanated from a scientific man.” Bence Jones\r\njust mentions it in half a line. Dr. Gladstone does not allude to it.\r\nIt therefore seems expedient to give here some extracts from the letter\r\nitself:--\r\n\r\n    THOUGHTS ON RAY-VIBRATIONS.\r\n\r\n  _To Richard Phillips, Esq._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,--At your request, I will endeavour to convey to you a\r\n    notion of that which I ventured to say at the close of the last\r\n    Friday evening meeting ...; but, from first to last, understand\r\n    that I merely threw out, as matter for speculation, the vague\r\n    impressions of my mind, for I gave nothing as the result of\r\n    sufficient consideration, or as the settled conviction, or even\r\n    probable conclusion at which I had arrived.\r\n\r\n    The point intended to be set forth for the consideration\r\n    of the hearers was whether it was not possible that the\r\n    vibrations--which in a certain theory are assumed to account\r\n    for radiation and radiant phenomena--may not occur in the lines\r\n    of force which connect particles, and consequently masses, of\r\n    matter together--a notion which, as far as it is admitted, will\r\n    dispense with the æther, which, in another view, is supposed to\r\n    be the medium in which these vibrations take place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Another consideration bearing conjointly on the hypothetical\r\n    view, both of matter and radiation, arises from the comparison\r\n    of the velocities with which the radiant action and certain\r\n    powers of matter are transmitted. The velocity of light through\r\n    space is about 190,000 miles[49] a second. The velocity of\r\n    electricity is, by the experiments of Wheatstone, shown to be\r\n    as great as this, if not greater. The light is supposed to be\r\n    transmitted by vibrations through an æther which is, so to\r\n    speak, destitute of gravitation, but infinite in elasticity;\r\n    the electricity is transmitted through a small metallic wire,\r\n    and is often viewed as transmitted by vibrations also. That\r\n    the electric transference depends on the forces or powers of\r\n    the matter of the wire can hardly be doubted when we consider\r\n    the different conductibility of the various metallic and\r\n    other bodies, the means of affecting it by heat or cold, the\r\n    way in which conducting bodies by combination enter into the\r\n    constitution of non-conducting substances, and the contrary,\r\n    and the actual existence of one elementary body (carbon)\r\n    both in the conducting and non-conducting state. The power\r\n    of electric conduction, being a transmission of force equal\r\n    in velocity to that of light, appears to be tied up in and\r\n    dependent upon the properties of the matter, and is, as it\r\n    were, existent in them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: LATERAL VIBRATIONS.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n    In experimental philosophy we can, by the phenomena presented,\r\n    recognise various kinds of lines of force. Thus there are the\r\n    lines of gravitating force, those of electrostatic induction,\r\n    those of magnetic action, and others partaking of a dynamic\r\n    character might be perhaps included. The lines of electric\r\n    and magnetic action are by many considered as exerted through\r\n    space like the lines of gravitating force. For my own part, I\r\n    incline to believe that when there are intervening particles\r\n    of matter--being themselves only centres of force--they take\r\n    part in carrying on the force through the line, but that when\r\n    there are none the line proceeds through space. Whatever the\r\n    view adopted respecting them may be, we can, at all events,\r\n    affect these lines of force in a manner which may be conceived\r\n    as partaking of the nature of a shake or lateral vibration.\r\n    For suppose two bodies, A B, distant from each other, and\r\n    under mutual action,[50] and therefore connected by lines of\r\n    force, and let us fix our attention upon one resultant of force\r\n    having an invariable direction as regards space; if one of\r\n    the bodies move in the least degree right or left, or if its\r\n    power be shifted for a moment within the mass (neither of these\r\n    cases being difficult to realise if A or B be either electric\r\n    or magnetic bodies), then an effect equivalent to a lateral\r\n    disturbance will take place in the resultant upon which we are\r\n    fixing our attention, for either it will increase in force\r\n    whilst the neighbouring resultants are diminishing, or it will\r\n    fall in force while they are increasing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The view which I am so bold as to put forth considers,\r\n    therefore, radiation as a high species of vibration in the\r\n    lines of force which are known to connect particles, and also\r\n    masses, of matter together. It endeavours to dismiss the æther,\r\n    but not the vibrations. The kind of vibration which, I believe,\r\n    can alone account for the wonderful, varied, and beautiful\r\n    phenomena of polarisation is not the same as that which occurs\r\n    on the surface of disturbed water or the waves of sound in\r\n    gases or liquids, for the vibrations in these cases are direct,\r\n    or to and from the centre of action, whereas the former are\r\n    lateral. It seems to me that the resultant of two or more lines\r\n    of force is in an apt condition for that action, which may be\r\n    considered as equivalent to a _lateral_ vibration; whereas a\r\n    uniform medium like the æther does not appear apt, or more apt\r\n    than air or water.\r\n\r\n    The occurrence of a change at one end of a line of force easily\r\n    suggests a consequent change at the other. The propagation of\r\n    light, and therefore probably of all radiant action, occupies\r\n    _time_; and that a vibration of the line of force should\r\n    account for the phenomena of radiation, it is necessary that\r\n    such vibration should occupy time also.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE SHADOW OF A SPECULATION.]\r\n\r\n    And now, my dear Phillips I must conclude. I do not think I\r\n    should have allowed these notions to have escaped from me had\r\n    I not been led unawares, and without previous consideration,\r\n    by the circumstances of the evening on which I had to appear\r\n    suddenly[51] and occupy the place of another. Now that I have\r\n    put them on paper, I feel that I ought to have kept them much\r\n    longer for study, consideration, and perhaps final rejection;\r\n    and it is only because they are sure to go abroad in one\r\n    way or another, in consequence of their utterance on that\r\n    evening, that I give them a shape, if shape it may be called,\r\n    in this reply to your inquiry. One thing is certain, that any\r\n    hypothetical view of radiation which is likely to be received\r\n    or retained as satisfactory must not much longer comprehend\r\n    alone certain phenomena of light, but must include those of\r\n    heat and of actinic influence also, and even the conjoined\r\n    phenomena of sensible heat and chemical power produced by\r\n    them. In this respect a view which is in some degree founded\r\n    upon the ordinary forces of matter may perhaps find a little\r\n    consideration amongst the other views that will probably\r\n    arise. I think it likely that I have made many mistakes in the\r\n    preceding pages, for even to myself my ideas on this point\r\n    appear only as the shadow of a speculation, or as one of those\r\n    impressions on the mind which are allowable for a time as\r\n    guides to thought and research. He who labours in experimental\r\n    inquiries knows how numerous these are, and how often their\r\n    apparent fitness and beauty vanish before the progress and\r\n    development of real, natural truth.\r\n\r\n                                        I am, my dear Phillips,\r\n                                              Ever truly yours,\r\n                                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n  _Royal Institution_,\r\n      _April 15, 1846_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it be thought that too high a value has here been set upon a\r\ndocument which its author himself only claimed to be “the shadow of\r\na speculation,” let that value be justified out of the mouth of the\r\nman who eighteen years later enriched the world with the mathematical\r\ntheory of the propagation of electric waves, the late Professor Clerk\r\nMaxwell. In 1864 he published in the _Philosophical Transactions_ a\r\n“Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field,” in which the following\r\npassages occur:--\r\n\r\n    We have therefore reason to believe, from the phenomena of\r\n    light and heat, that there is an æthereal medium filling\r\n    space and permeating bodies capable of being set in motion,\r\n    and of transmitting that motion to gross matter, so as to\r\n    heat it and affect it in various ways.... Hence the parts\r\n    of this medium must be so connected that the motion of one\r\n    part depends in some way on the motion of the rest; and at\r\n    the same time these connections must be capable of a certain\r\n    kind of elastic yielding, since the communication of motion\r\n    is not instantaneous, but occupies time. The medium is\r\n    therefore capable of receiving and storing up two kinds of\r\n    energy--namely, the “actual” energy depending on the motion of\r\n    its parts, and “potential” energy, consisting of the work which\r\n    the medium will do in recovering from displacement in virtue of\r\n    its elasticity.\r\n\r\n    The propagation of undulations consists in the continual\r\n    transformation of one of these forms of energy into the other\r\n    alternately, and at any instant the amount of energy in the\r\n    whole medium is equally divided, so that half is energy of\r\n    motion and half is elastic resilience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In order to bring these results within the power of symbolic\r\n    calculation, I then express them in the form of the general\r\n    equations of the electromagnetic field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The general equations are next applied to the case of a\r\n    magnetic disturbance propagated through a non-conducting field,\r\n    and it is shown that the only disturbances which can be so\r\n    propagated are those which are transverse to the direction\r\n    of propagation, and that the velocity of propagation is\r\n    the velocity _v_, found from experiments such as those of\r\n    Weber, which expresses the number of electrostatic units of\r\n    electricity which are contained in one electromagnetic unit.\r\n    This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have\r\n    strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant\r\n    heat and other radiations, if any) is an electromagnetic\r\n    disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the\r\n    electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws....\r\n    Conducting media are shown to absorb such radiations rapidly,\r\n    and therefore to be generally opaque.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY OF LIGHT.]\r\n\r\n    The conception of the propagation of transverse magnetic\r\n    disturbances to the exclusion of normal ones is distinctly set\r\n    forth by Professor Faraday in his “Thoughts on Ray Vibrations.”\r\n    _The electromagnetic theory of light, as proposed by him, is\r\n    the same in substance as that which I have begun to develop\r\n    in this paper_,[52] except that in 1846 there were no data to\r\n    calculate the velocity of propagation.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of this year (1846) and the next Faraday did very\r\nlittle research, though he continued his Royal Institution lectures and\r\nhis reports for Trinity House. Amongst the latter in 1847 was one on\r\na proposal to light buoys by incandescent electric lamps containing a\r\nplatinum wire spiral. He was compelled, indeed, to rest by a recurrence\r\nof brain troubles, giddiness, and loss of memory. Honours however,\r\ncontinued to be heaped upon him both abroad and at home, as the\r\nfollowing extract from Bence Jones shows:--\r\n\r\n    In 1846, for his two great discoveries, the Rumford and the\r\n    Royal Medals were both awarded to him. This double honour\r\n    will probably long be unique in the annals of the Royal\r\n    Society. In former years he had already received the Copley\r\n    and Royal Medals for his experimental discoveries. As his\r\n    medals increased it became remarkable that he--who kept his\r\n    diploma-book, his portraits and letters of scientific men, and\r\n    everything he had in the most perfect order--seemed to take\r\n    least care of his most valuable rewards. They were locked up in\r\n    a box, and might have passed for old iron. Probably he thought,\r\n    as others did afterwards, that their value, if seen, might lead\r\n    to their loss.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRYSTALLINE FORCES.]\r\n\r\nBetween the twenty-first and twenty-second series of “Experimental\r\nResearches” nearly three years elapsed. In the autumn of 1848 the\r\nmatter which claimed investigation was the peculiar behaviour of\r\nbismuth in the magnetic field. Certain anomalies were observed\r\nwhich were finally traced to the crystalline nature of the metal,\r\nfor it appeared that when in that state the crystals themselves--to\r\nadopt modern phraseology--showed a greater magnetic permeability in\r\na direction perpendicular to their planes of cleavage than in any\r\ndirection parallel to those planes. Hence when a crystalline fragment\r\nwas hung in a _uniform_ magnetic field (where the diamagnetic tendency\r\nto move from a strong to a weak region of the field was eliminated),\r\nit tended to point in a determinate direction. Faraday expressed it\r\nthat the structure of the crystal showed a certain “axiality,” and he\r\nregarded these effects as presenting evidence of a “magnecrystallic”\r\nforce, the law of action being that the line or axis of magnecrystallic\r\nforce tended to place itself parallel to the lines of the magnetic\r\nfield in which the crystal was placed. Arsenic, antimony, and other\r\ncrystalline metals were similarly examined. The subject was an\r\nintricate one, and there are frequent obscurities in the phraseology\r\ntentatively adopted for explaining the phenomena. In one place Faraday\r\nrather pathetically laments his imperfect mathematical knowledge.\r\nThis seems like an echo of his inability to follow the analytical\r\nreasoning of Poisson, who, starting from a hypothesis about the\r\nsupposed “magnetic fluids” being movable within the particles of a\r\nbody, supposing that these particles were non-spherical and were\r\nsymmetrically arranged, had predicted (in 1827) that a portion of such\r\na substance would, when brought into the neighbourhood of a magnet,\r\nact differently, according to the different positions in which it\r\nmight be turned about its centre. But this very inability to follow\r\nPoisson’s refined analysis gave a new direction to Faraday’s thoughts,\r\nand caused him to conceive the idea of magnetic permeabilities\r\ndiffering in different directions, an idea which, as Sir William\r\nThomson (the present Lord Kelvin) showed in 1851,[53] is equally\r\nsusceptible of mathematical treatment by appropriate symbols. Lord\r\nKelvin has also spoken (_op. cit._, p. 484) of the matter as follows:\r\n“The singular combination of mathematical acuteness with experimental\r\nresearch and profound physical speculation which Faraday, though not\r\na ‘mathematician,’ presented is remarkably illustrated by his use of\r\nthe expression ‘_conducting power of a magnetic medium for lines of\r\nforce_.’” Tyndall has given a succinct summary of these researches--in\r\nwhich also he took a part--from which the following extract must\r\nsuffice:--\r\n\r\n    And here follows one of those expressions which characterise\r\n    the conceptions of Faraday in regard to force generally: “It\r\n    appears to me impossible to conceive of the results in any\r\n    other way than by a mutual reaction of the magnetic force, and\r\n    the force of the particles of the crystal upon each other.” He\r\n    proves that the action of the force, though thus molecular,\r\n    is an action at a distance. He shows that a bismuth crystal\r\n    can cause a freely-suspended magnetic needle to set parallel\r\n    to its magnecrystallic axis. Few living men are aware of the\r\n    difficulty of obtaining results like this, or of the delicacy\r\n    necessary to their attainment. “But though it thus takes up the\r\n    character of a force acting at a distance, still it is due to\r\n    that power of the particles which makes them cohere in regular\r\n    order and gives the mass its crystalline aggregation, and so\r\n    often spoken of as acting at _insensible_ distances.” Thus he\r\n    broods over this new force, and looks at it from all points of\r\n    inspection. Experiment follows experiment, as thought follows\r\n    thought. He will not relinquish the subject as long as a hope\r\n    exists of throwing more light upon it. He knows full well the\r\n    anomalous nature of the conclusion to which his experiments\r\n    lead him. But experiment to him is final, and he will not\r\n    shrink from the conclusion. “This force,” he says, “appears to\r\n    me to be very strange and striking in its character. It is not\r\n    polar, for there is no attraction or repulsion.” And then, as\r\n    if startled by his own utterance, he asks: “What is the nature\r\n    of the mechanical force which turns the crystal round and makes\r\n    it affect a magnet?”... “I do not remember,” he continues,\r\n    “heretofore such a case of force as the present one--where\r\n    a body is brought into position only without attraction or\r\n    repulsion.”\r\n\r\n    Plücker, the celebrated geometer already mentioned, who pursued\r\n    experimental physics for many years of his life with singular\r\n    devotion and success, visited Faraday in those days, and\r\n    repeated before him his beautiful experiments on magneto-optic\r\n    action. Faraday repeated and verified Plücker’s observations,\r\n    and concluded, what he at first seemed to doubt, that Plücker’s\r\n    results and magnecrystallic action had the same origin.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: MAGNETISM AND CRYSTALLISATION.]\r\n\r\n    At the end of his papers, when he takes a last look along\r\n    the line of research, and then turns his eyes to the future,\r\n    utterances quite as much emotional as scientific escape from\r\n    Faraday. “I cannot,” he says at the end of his first paper on\r\n    magnecrystallic action, “conclude this series of researches\r\n    without remarking how rapidly the knowledge of molecular forces\r\n    grows upon us, and how strikingly every investigation tends\r\n    to develop more and more their importance and their extreme\r\n    attraction as an object of study. A few years ago magnetism was\r\n    to us an occult power, affecting only a few bodies. Now it is\r\n    found to influence all bodies, and to possess the most intimate\r\n    relations with electricity, heat, chemical action, light,\r\n    crystallisation, and through it with the forces concerned in\r\n    cohesion. And we may, in the present state of things, well feel\r\n    urged to continue in our labours, encouraged by the hope of\r\n    bringing it into a bond of union with gravity itself.”\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Faraday gave five Friday night discourses, three of them on\r\nthe “Diamagnetic Condition of Flame and Gases.” In 1849 he gave two,\r\none of them on Plücker’s researches. In 1850 he gave two, one of them\r\nbeing on the electricity of the air, the other on certain conditions of\r\nfreezing water. He had meanwhile continued to work at magnetism. The\r\ntwenty-third series dealt with the supposed diamagnetic polarity. It\r\nincidentally discussed the distortion produced in a magnetic field by\r\na mass of copper in motion across it. The twenty-fourth series was on\r\nthe possible relation of gravity to electricity. The paper concludes\r\nwith the words: “Here end my trials for the present. The results are\r\nnegative. They do not shake my strong feeling of the existence of a\r\nrelation between gravity and electricity, though they give no proof\r\nthat such a relation exists.” The next series (the twenty-fifth) was\r\non the “Non-expansion of Gases by Magnetic Force” and on the “Magnetic\r\nCharacters of Oxygen [which he had found to be highly magnetic],\r\nNitrogen, and Space.” He had found that magnetically substances must be\r\nclassed either along with iron and the materials that point axially, or\r\nelse with bismuth and those that point equatorially, in the magnetic\r\nfield. The best vacuum he could procure he regarded as the zero of\r\nthese tests; but before adopting it as such, he verified by experiment\r\nthat even in a vacuum a magnetic body still tends from weaker to\r\nstronger places in the magnetic field; while diamagnetic bodies tend\r\nfrom stronger to weaker. He then says we must consider the magnetic\r\ncharacter and relation of _space_ free from any material substance.\r\n“Mere space cannot act as matter acts, even though the utmost latitude\r\nbe allowed to the hypothesis of an ether.” He then proceeds as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MORE NEW WORDS.]\r\n\r\n    Now that the true zero is obtained, and the great variety of\r\n    material substances satisfactorily divided into two general\r\n    classes, it appears to me that we want another name for\r\n    the magnetic class, that we may avoid confusion. The word\r\n    _magnetic_ ought to be general, and include _all_ the phenomena\r\n    and effects produced by that power. But then a word for the\r\n    subdivision opposed to the diamagnetic class is necessary.\r\n    As the language of this branch of science may soon require\r\n    general and careful changes, I, assisted by a kind friend, have\r\n    thought that a word--not selected with particular care--might\r\n    be provisionally useful; and as the magnetism of iron, nickel,\r\n    and cobalt when in the magnetic field is like that of the\r\n    earth as a whole, so that when rendered active they place\r\n    themselves parallel to its axes or lines of magnetic force, I\r\n    have supposed that they and their similars (including oxygen\r\n    now) might be called paramagnetic bodies, giving the following\r\n    division:--\r\n\r\n                             { paramagnetic\r\n                    Magnetic {\r\n                             { diamagnetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “kind friend” alluded to was Whewell, as the following letter\r\nshows:--\r\n\r\n    [_Rev. W. Whewell to M. Faraday._]\r\n\r\n                                        July, 1850.\r\n\r\n    I am always glad to hear of your wanting new words, because\r\n    the want shows that you are pursuing new thoughts--and your\r\n    new thoughts are worth something--but I always feel also how\r\n    difficult it is for one who has not pursued the train of\r\n    thought to suggest the right word. There are so many relations\r\n    involved in a new discovery, and the word ought not glaringly\r\n    to violate any of them. The purists would certainly object\r\n    to the opposition, or co-ordination, of _ferromagnetic_ and\r\n    _diamagnetic_, not only on account of the want of symmetry\r\n    in the relation of _ferro_ and _dia_, but also because the\r\n    one is Latin and the other Greek.... Hence it would appear\r\n    that the two classes of magnetic bodies are those which place\r\n    their length _parallel_, or _according_, to the terrestrial\r\n    magnetic lines, and those which place their length transverse\r\n    to such lines. Keeping the preposition _dia_ for the latter,\r\n    the preposition _para_, or _ana_, might be used for the former.\r\n    Perhaps para would be best, as the word _parallel_, in which it\r\n    is involved, would be a technical memory for it.... I rejoice\r\n    to hear that you have new views of discovery opening to you. I\r\n    always rejoice to hail the light of such when they dawn upon\r\n    you.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-sixth series of researches opened with a consideration of\r\nmagnetic “conducting power,” or permeability as we should now term\r\nit, and then branched off into a lengthy discussion of atmospheric\r\nmagnetism. The subject was continued through the twenty-seventh series,\r\nwhich was completed in November, 1850. The gist of this is summed up in\r\none of his letters to Schönbein:--\r\n\r\n                              Royal Institution, November 19, 1850.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SCHÖNBEIN,--I wish I could talk with you, instead of\r\n    being obliged to use pen and paper. I have fifty matters to\r\n    speak about, but either they are too trifling for writing, or\r\n    too important, for what can one discuss or say in a letter?...\r\n    By the bye, I have been working with the oxygen of the air\r\n    also. You remember that three years ago I distinguished it as\r\n    a magnetic gas in my paper on the diamagnetism of flame and\r\n    gases founded on Bancalari’s experiment. Now I find in it the\r\n    cause of all the annual and diurnal, and many of the irregular,\r\n    variations in the terrestrial magnetism. The observations made\r\n    at Hobarton, Toronto, Greenwich, St. Petersburg, Washington,\r\n    St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and Singapore, all appear\r\n    to me to accord with and support my hypothesis. I will not\r\n    pretend to give you an account of it here, for it would require\r\n    some detail, and I really am weary of the subject. I have sent\r\n    in three long papers to the Royal Society, and you shall have\r\n    copies of them in due time....\r\n\r\n                    Ever, my dear Schönbein, most truly yours,\r\n                                                       M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PAPERS TO BE LET LOOSE.]\r\n\r\nWhile writing out these researches for the Royal Society, he had been\r\nstaying in Upper Norwood. He wrote thus of himself to Miss Moore at\r\nthe end of August:--\r\n\r\n    We have taken a little house here on the hill-top, where I have\r\n    a small room to myself, and have, ever since we came here, been\r\n    deeply immersed in magnetic cogitations. I write, and write,\r\n    and write, until three papers for the Royal Society are nearly\r\n    completed, and I hope that two of them will be good if they\r\n    justify my hopes, for I have to criticise them again and again\r\n    before I let them loose. You shall hear of them at some of the\r\n    Friday evenings. At present I must not say more. After writing,\r\n    I walk out in the evening, hand-in-hand with my dear wife, to\r\n    enjoy the sunset; for to me, who love scenery, of all that I\r\n    have seen or can see there is none surpasses that of Heaven. A\r\n    glorious sunset brings with it a thousand thoughts that delight\r\n    me.\r\n\r\nTo De la Rive he wrote later as follows:--\r\n\r\n    [_M. Faraday to A. de la Rive._]\r\n\r\n                              Royal Institution, February 4, 1851.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR DE LA RIVE,--My wife and I were exceedingly sorry to\r\n    hear of your sad loss. It brought vividly to our remembrance\r\n    the time when we were at your house, and you, and others with\r\n    you, made us so welcome. What can we say to these changes but\r\n    that they show by comparison the vanity of all things under the\r\n    sun? I am very glad that you have spirits to return to work\r\n    again, for that is a healthy and proper employment of the mind\r\n    under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n    With respect to my views and experiments, I do not think\r\n    that anything shorter than the papers (and they will run\r\n    to a hundred pages in the “Transactions”) will give you\r\n    possession of the subject, because a great deal depends upon\r\n    the comparison of observations in different parts of the world\r\n    with the facts obtained by experiment, and with the deductions\r\n    drawn from them; but I will try to give you an idea of the root\r\n    of the matter. You are aware that I use the phrase _line of\r\n    magnetic force_, to represent the presence of magnetic force,\r\n    and the direction (of polarity) in which it is exerted; and by\r\n    the idea which it conveys one obtains very well, and I believe\r\n    without error, a notion of the distribution of the forces about\r\n    a bar magnet, or between near flat poles presenting a field\r\n    of equal force, or in any other case. Now, if circumstances\r\n    be arranged so as to present a field of equal force, which is\r\n    easily done, as I have shown by the electro-magnet, then if a\r\n    sphere of iron or nickel be placed in the field, it immediately\r\n    disturbs the direction of the lines of force, for they are\r\n    concentrated within the sphere. They are, however, not merely\r\n    concentrated, but _contorted_, for the sum of forces in any\r\n    one section across the field is always equal to the sum of\r\n    forces in any other section, and therefore their condensation\r\n    in the iron or nickel cannot occur without this contortion.\r\n    Moreover, the contortion is easily shown by using a small\r\n    needle (one-tenth of an inch long) to examine the field, for,\r\n    as before the introduction of the sphere of iron or nickel, it\r\n    would always take up a position parallel to itself. Afterwards\r\n    it varies in position in different places near the sphere.\r\n    This being understood, let us then suppose the sphere to be\r\n    raised in temperature. At a certain temperature it begins to\r\n    lose its power of affecting the lines of magnetic force, and\r\n    ends by retaining scarcely any. So that as regards the little\r\n    needle mentioned above, it now stands everywhere parallel to\r\n    itself within the field of force. This change occurs with iron\r\n    at a very high temperature, and is passed through within the\r\n    compass, apparently, of a small number of degrees. With nickel\r\n    it occurs at much lower temperatures, being affected by the\r\n    heat of boiling oil.\r\n\r\n    Now take another step. Oxygen, as I showed above, three years\r\n    ago in the _Philosophical Magazine_ for 1847, vol. xxxi.,\r\n    pp. 410, 415, 416, is magnetic in relation to nitrogen and\r\n    other gases. E. Becquerel, without knowing of my results, has\r\n    confirmed and extended them in his paper of last year, and\r\n    given certain excellent measures. In my paper of 1847 I showed\r\n    also that oxygen (like iron and nickel) lost its magnetic power\r\n    and its ability of being attracted by the magnet when heated\r\n    (p. 417). And I further showed that the temperatures at which\r\n    this took place were within the range of common temperature,\r\n    for the oxygen of the air--_i.e._ the air altogether--is\r\n    increased in magnetic power when cooled to 0° F. (p. 406).\r\n    Now I must refer you to the papers themselves for the (to\r\n    me) strange results of the incompressibility (magnetically\r\n    speaking) of oxygen and the inexpansibility of nitrogen and\r\n    other gases; for the description of a differential balance by\r\n    which I can compare gas with gas, or the same gas at different\r\n    degrees of rarefaction; for the determination of the true\r\n    zero, or point between magnetic and diamagnetic bodies; and\r\n    for certain views of magnetic conduction and polarity. You\r\n    will there find described certain very delicate experiments\r\n    upon diamagnetic and very weak magnetic bodies concerning\r\n    their action on each other in a magnetic field of equal force.\r\n    The magnetic bodies repel each other, and the diamagnetic\r\n    bodies repel each other; but a magnetic and a diamagnetic body\r\n    _attract_ each other. And these results, combined with the\r\n    qualities of oxygen as just described, convince me that it is\r\n    able to deflect the lines of magnetic force passing through it\r\n    just as iron or nickel is, but to an infinitely smaller amount,\r\n    and that its power of deflecting the lines varies with its\r\n    temperature and degree of rarefaction.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: ATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISM.]\r\n\r\n    Then comes in the consideration of the atmosphere, and the\r\n    manner in which it rises and falls in temperature by the\r\n    presence and absence of the sun. The place of the great warm\r\n    region nearly in his neighbourhood; of the two colder regions\r\n    which grow up and diminish in the northern and southern\r\n    hemispheres as the sun travels between the tropics; the\r\n    effect of the extra warmth of the northern hemisphere over\r\n    the southern; the effect of accumulation from the action of\r\n    preceding months; the effect of dip and mean declination\r\n    at each particular station; the effects that follow from\r\n    the non-coincidence of magnetic and astronomical conditions\r\n    of polarity, meridians, and so forth; the results of the\r\n    distribution of land and water for any given place--for all\r\n    these and many other things I must refer you to the papers.\r\n    I could not do them justice in any account that a letter\r\n    could contain, and should run the risk of leading you into\r\n    error regarding them. But I may say that, deducing from the\r\n    experiments and the theory what are the deviations of the\r\n    magnetic needle at any given station, which may be expected as\r\n    the mean result of the heating and cooling of the atmosphere\r\n    for a given season and hour, I find such a general accordance\r\n    with the results of observations, especially in the direction\r\n    and generally in the amount for different seasons of the\r\n    _declination_ variation, as to give me the strongest hopes that\r\n    I have assigned the true physical cause of those variations,\r\n    and shown the _modus operandi_ of their production.\r\n\r\n    And now, my dear de la Rive, I must leave you and run to other\r\n    matters. As soon as I can send you a copy of the papers I will\r\n    do so, and can only say I hope that they will meet with your\r\n    approbation. With the kindest remembrances to your son,\r\n\r\n    Believe me to be, my dear friend, ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis hope of explaining the variations of terrestrial magnetism by\r\nthe magnetic properties of the oxygen of the air was destined to be\r\nillusory. At that time the cosmical nature of magnetic storms was\r\nunknown and unsuspected. To this matter we may well apply Faraday’s own\r\nwords addressed to Tyndall respecting the alleged diamagnetic polarity,\r\nand the conflict of views between himself on the one hand and Weber and\r\nTyndall on the other:--“It is not wonderful that views differ at first.\r\nTime will gradually sift and shape them. And I believe that we have\r\nlittle idea at present of the importance they may have ten or twenty\r\nyears hence.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LINES OF MAGNETIC FORCE.]\r\n\r\nIn 1851, from July to December, Faraday was actively at work in the\r\nlaboratory. The results constitute the material for the twenty-eighth\r\nand twenty-ninth (the last) series of the “Experimental Researches.”\r\nIn these he returned to the subject with which the first series had\r\nopened in 1831: the induction of electric currents by the relative\r\nmotion of magnets and conducting wires. These two memoirs, together\r\nwith his Royal Institution lecture of January, 1852, “On the Lines of\r\nMagnetic Force,” and the paper “On the Physical Character of the Lines\r\nof Magnetic Force” (which he sent to the _Philosophical Magazine_, as\r\ncontaining “so much of a speculative and hypothetical nature”), should\r\nbe read, and re-read, and read again, by every student of physics.\r\nThey are reprinted at the end of the third volume of the “Experimental\r\nResearches.”\r\n\r\nIn the opening of the twenty-eighth memoir he says:--\r\n\r\n    From my earliest experiments on the relation of electricity and\r\n    magnetism, I have had to think and speak of lines of magnetic\r\n    force as representations of the magnetic power--not merely in\r\n    the points of quality and direction, but also in quantity....\r\n    The direction of these lines about and amongst magnets and\r\n    electric currents is easily represented and understood in a\r\n    general manner by the ordinary use of iron filings.\r\n\r\n    A point equally important to the definition of these lines\r\n    is, that they represent a determinate and unchanging amount\r\n    of force. Though, therefore, their forms, as they exist\r\n    between two or more centres or sources of power, may vary very\r\n    greatly, and also the space through which they may be traced,\r\n    yet the sum of power contained in any one section of a given\r\n    portion of the lines is exactly equal to the sum of power in\r\n    any other section[54] of the same lines, however altered in\r\n    form or however convergent or divergent they may be at the\r\n    second place.... Now, it appears to me that these lines may\r\n    be employed with great advantage to represent the nature,\r\n    condition, and comparative amount of the magnetic forces,\r\n    and that in many cases they have, to the physical reasoner,\r\n    at least, a superiority over that method which represents\r\n    the forces as concentrated in centres of action, such as the\r\n    poles of magnets or needles; or some other methods, as, for\r\n    instance, that which considers north or south magnetisms as\r\n    fluids diffused over the end, or amongst the particles, of a\r\n    bar. No doubt any of these methods which does not assume too\r\n    much will, with a faithful application, give true results. And\r\n    so they all ought to give the same results, as far as they can\r\n    respectively be applied. But some may, by their very nature, be\r\n    applicable to a far greater extent, and give far more varied\r\n    results, than others. For, just as either geometry or analysis\r\n    may be employed to solve correctly a particular problem, though\r\n    one has far more power and capability, generally speaking, than\r\n    the other; or, just as either the idea of the reflexion of\r\n    images or that of the reverberation of sounds may be used to\r\n    represent certain physical forces and conditions, so may the\r\n    idea of the attractions and repulsions of centres, or that of\r\n    the disposition of magnetic fluids, or that of lines of force,\r\n    be applied in the consideration of magnetic phenomena. It is\r\n    the occasional and more frequent use of the latter which I at\r\n    present wish to advocate.... When the natural truth, and the\r\n    conventional representation of it, most closely agree, then\r\n    are we most advanced in our knowledge. The emission and æther\r\n    theories present such cases in relation to light. The idea\r\n    of a fluid or of two fluids is the same for electricity; and\r\n    there the further idea of a current has been raised, which,\r\n    indeed, has such hold on the mind as occasionally to embarrass\r\n    the science as respects the true character of the physical\r\n    agencies, and may be doing so even now to a degree which we at\r\n    present little suspect. The same is the case with the idea of\r\n    a magnetic fluid or fluids, or with the assumption of magnetic\r\n    centres of action of which the resultants are at the poles.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ÆTHER.]\r\n\r\n    How the magnetic force is transferred through bodies or through\r\n    space we know not--whether the result is merely action at a\r\n    distance, as in the case of gravity, or by some intermediate\r\n    agency, as in the cases of light, heat, the electric current,\r\n    and, as I believe, static electric action. The idea of magnetic\r\n    fluids, as applied by some, or of magnetic centres of action,\r\n    does not include that of the latter kind of transmission,\r\n    but the idea of lines of force does. Nevertheless, because a\r\n    particular method of representing the forces does not include\r\n    such a mode of transmission, the latter is not disproved, and\r\n    that method of representation which harmonises with it may be\r\n    the most true to nature. The general conclusion of philosophers\r\n    seems to be that such cases are by far the most numerous. And\r\n    for my own part, considering the relation of a vacuum to the\r\n    magnetic force, and the general character of magnetic phenomena\r\n    external to the magnet, I am more inclined to the notion that\r\n    in the transmission of the force there is such an action,\r\n    external to the magnet, than that the effects are merely\r\n    attraction and repulsion at a distance. _Such an action may be\r\n    a function of the æther, for it is not at all unlikely that if\r\n    there be an æther, it should have other uses than simply the\r\n    conveyance of radiations._[55]\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to recount the experimental evidence of revolving\r\nmagnets and loops of wire. Following out the old lines of so moving\r\nthe parts of the system that the magnetic lines were “cut” by the\r\ncopper conductors, and connecting the latter with a slow-period\r\ngalvanometer, to test the resultant induction, he found that “the\r\n_amount_ of magnetic force” [or _flux_, as we should nowadays call it]\r\n“is determinate for the same lines of force, whatever the distance of\r\nthe point or plane at which their power is exerted is from the magnet.”\r\nThe convergence or divergence of the lines of force caused, _per se_,\r\nno difference in their amount. Obliquity of intersection caused no\r\ndifference, provided the same lines of force were cut. If a wire was\r\nmoving in a field of equal intensity, and with a uniform motion, then\r\nthe current produced was proportional to the velocity of motion. The\r\n“quantity of electricity thrown into a current” was, _ceteris paribus_,\r\n“directly as the amount of curves intersected.” Within the magnet,\r\nrunning through its substance, existed lines of force of the _same\r\nnature_ as those without, exactly equal in _amount_ to those without,\r\nand were, indeed, _continuous_ with them. The conclusion must logically\r\nbe that every line of force is a closed circuit.\r\n\r\nHaving thus established the exact quantitative laws of magneto-electric\r\ninduction, he then advanced to make use of the induced current as a\r\nmeans of investigating the presence, direction, and amount of magnetic\r\nforces--in other words, to explore and measure magnetic fields. He\r\nconstructed revolving rectangles and rings furnished with a simple\r\ncommutator, to measure inductively the magnetic forces of the earth.\r\nThen he employed the induced current to test the constancy of magnets\r\nwhen placed near to other magnets in ways that might affect their\r\npower. Next he considers the fields of magnetic force of two or more\r\nassociated magnets, and notes how their magnetic lines may coalesce\r\nwhen they are so placed as to constitute parts of a common magnetic\r\ncircuit. The twenty-ninth series is brought to a close by a discussion\r\nof the experimental way of delineating lines of magnetic force by means\r\nof iron filings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE ELECTROTONIC STATE.]\r\n\r\nThe paper on the “Physical Character of the Lines of Magnetic Force”\r\nrecapitulated the points established in the twenty-ninth series of\r\n“Researches,” and emphasis is laid upon the logical necessity that\r\ntime must be required for their propagation. The physical effects\r\nin a magnetic field, as equivalent to a tendency for the magnetic\r\nlines to shorten themselves, and to repel one another laterally, are\r\nconsidered, and are contrasted with the effects of parallel electric\r\ncurrents. Commenting on the mutual relation between the directions of\r\nan electric current and of its surrounding magnetic lines, he raises\r\nthe question whether or not they consist in a state of tension of the\r\næther. “Again and again,” he says, “the idea of an _electrotonic_ state\r\nhas been forced on my mind. Such a state would coincide and become\r\nidentified with that which would then constitute the physical lines\r\nof magnetic force.” Then he traces out the analogy between a magnet,\r\nwith its “sphondyloid” (or spindle-form field) of magnetic lines, and\r\na voltaic battery immersed in water, with its re-entrant lines of flow\r\nof circulating current. Incidentally, while discussing the principle\r\nof the magnetic circuit, he points out that when a magnet is furnished\r\nat its poles with masses of soft iron, it can both receive and retain\r\na higher magnetic charge than it does without them, “for these masses\r\ncarry on the physical lines of force, and deliver them to a body of\r\nsurrounding space, which is either widened, and therefore increased, in\r\nthe direction across the lines of force, or shortened in that direction\r\nparallel to them, or both; and both are circumstances which facilitate\r\nthe conduction from pole to pole.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NOVELTY OF FARADAY’S VIEWS.]\r\n\r\nThus closed, with the exception of two fragmentary papers, one on\r\n“Physical Lines of Force,” and the other on “Some Points in Magnetic\r\nPhilosophy,” in the years 1853 and 1854 respectively, the main\r\nlife-work of Faraday, his “Experimental Researches.” Their effect\r\nin revolutionising electric science, if slow, was yet sure. Though\r\nthe principle of the dynamo was discovered and published in 1831,\r\nnearly forty years elapsed before electric-lighting machinery became\r\na commercial product. Though the dependence of inductive actions,\r\nboth electromagnetic and electrostatic, upon the properties of\r\nthe intervening medium was demonstrated and elaborated in these\r\n“Researches,” electricians for many years continued to propound\r\ntheories which ignored this fundamental fact. French and German writers\r\ncontinued to publish treatises based on the ancient doctrines of\r\naction at a distance, and of imaginary electric and magnetic fluids.\r\nVon Boltzmann, a typical German of the first rank in science, says\r\nthat until there came straight from England the counter-doctrines\r\namidst which Faraday had lived, “we (in Germany and France) had all\r\nmore or less imbibed with our mothers’ milk the ideas of magnetic\r\nand electric fluids acting direct at a distance.” And again, “The\r\ntheory of Maxwell”--that is, Faraday’s theory thrown by Maxwell into\r\nmathematical shape--“is so diametrically opposed to the ideas which\r\nhave become customary to us, that we must first cast behind us all our\r\nprevious views of the nature and operation of electric forces before\r\nwe can enter into its portals.” The divergence of view between Faraday\r\nand the Continental electricians is nowhere more clearly stated than\r\nby Faraday’s great interpreter, Maxwell, in the _apologia_ which he\r\nprefixed in 1873 to his “Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism,”\r\nwherein, speaking of the differences between this work and those\r\nrecently published in Germany, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    One reason of this is that before I began the study of\r\n    electricity I resolved to read no mathematics on the subject\r\n    till I had first read through Faraday’s “Experimental\r\n    Researches on Electricity.” I was aware that there was supposed\r\n    to be a difference between Faraday’s way of conceiving\r\n    phenomena and that of the mathematicians. So that neither he\r\n    nor they were satisfied with each other’s language. I had also\r\n    the conviction that this discrepancy did not arise from either\r\n    party being wrong. I was first convinced of this by Sir William\r\n    Thomson [Lord Kelvin], to whose advice and assistance, as well\r\n    as to his published papers, I owe most of what I have learned\r\n    on this subject.\r\n\r\n    As I proceeded with the study of Faraday, I perceived that his\r\n    method of conceiving the phenomena was also a mathematical one,\r\n    though not exhibited in the conventional form of mathematical\r\n    symbols. I also found that these methods were capable of being\r\n    expressed in the ordinary mathematical forms, and thus compared\r\n    with those of the professed mathematicians.\r\n\r\n    For instance, Faraday, in his mind’s eye, saw lines of force\r\n    traversing all space where the mathematicians saw centres of\r\n    force attracting at a distance. Faraday saw a medium where\r\n    they saw nothing but distance. Faraday sought the seat of the\r\n    phenomena in real actions going on in the medium; they were\r\n    satisfied that they had found it in a power of action at a\r\n    distance impressed on electric fluids.\r\n\r\n    When I had translated what I considered to be Faraday’s ideas\r\n    into a mathematical form, I found that in general the results\r\n    of the two methods coincided, so that the same phenomena were\r\n    accounted for and the same laws of action deduced by both\r\n    methods, but that Faraday’s methods resembled those in which\r\n    we begin with the whole and arrive at the parts by analysis,\r\n    while the ordinary mathematical methods were founded on the\r\n    principle of beginning with the parts and building up the whole\r\n    by synthesis.\r\n\r\n    I found, also, that several of the most fertile methods of\r\n    research discovered by the mathematicians could be expressed\r\n    much better in terms of ideas derived from Faraday than in\r\n    their original form.\r\n\r\n    The whole theory, for instance, of potential, considered as\r\n    a quantity which satisfies a certain partial differential\r\n    equation, belongs essentially to the method which I have called\r\n    of Faraday....\r\n\r\n    If by anything I have here written I may assist any student\r\n    in understanding Faraday’s modes of thought and expression, I\r\n    shall regard it as the accomplishment of one of my principal\r\n    aims: to communicate to others the same delight which I have\r\n    found myself in reading Faraday’s “Researches.”\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell may also be credited with the remark that Faraday’s work\r\nhad had the result of banishing the term “the electric fluid” into the\r\nlimbo of newspaper science.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ELECTRIC LIGHT IN LIGHTHOUSES.]\r\n\r\nFaraday’s work for Trinity House continued during these last years of\r\nresearch work. He reported on such subjects as adulteration of white\r\nlead, impure oils, Chance’s lenses, lighthouse ventilation, and fog\r\nsignals. Two systems of electric arc lighting for lighthouses--one by\r\nWatson, using batteries, the other by Holmes, using a magneto-electric\r\nmachine--were examined in 1853 and 1854, but his report on them was\r\nadverse. He “could not put up in a lighthouse what has not been\r\nestablished beforehand, and is only experimental.” In 1856 he made five\r\nreports, in 1857 six, and in 1858 twelve reports to Trinity House,\r\none of these being on the electric light at the South Foreland. In\r\n1859 he reported on further trials in which Duboscq’s lamps were used.\r\nIn 1860 he gave a final report on the practicability and utility of\r\nmagneto-electric lighting, and expressed the hope it would be applied,\r\nas there was _now_ no difficulty. In 1861 he inspected the machinery as\r\nestablished at the Dungeness lighthouse. In 1862 he gave no fewer than\r\nseventeen reports, visiting Dungeness, Grisnez, and the South Foreland.\r\nIn 1863 he again visited Dungeness. In 1864 he made twelve reports, and\r\nexamined the drawings and estimates for establishing the electric light\r\nat Portland. His last report was in 1865, upon the St. Bees’ light, and\r\nhe then retired from this service.\r\n\r\nHis Friday night discourses were still continued during these years.\r\nIn 1855 he gave one on “Ruhmkorff’s Induction-coil.” In 1856 he gave\r\none on a process for silvering glass, and on finely divided gold. This\r\nlatter subject, the optical properties of precipitated gold, formed\r\nthe topic of the Bakerian lecture of that year--his last contribution\r\nto the Royal Society. He gave another discourse on the same subject\r\nin 1857, and also one on the conservation of force. In 1856, when\r\ninvestigating the crystallisation of water, he discovered the\r\nphenomenon of regelation of ice. In virtue of this property two pieces\r\nof ice will freeze solidly together under pressure, even when the\r\ntemperature of the surrounding atmosphere is above the freezing point.\r\nThis discovery led on the one hand to the explanation of glacier\r\nmotions; on the other to important results in thermodynamic theory. In\r\n1859 he gave two discourses, one on ozone, the other on phosphorescence\r\nand fluorescence. He also gave two in 1860, on lighthouse illumination\r\nby electric light, and on the electric silk-loom. In 1861 he discoursed\r\non platinum and on De la Rue’s eclipse photographs. The last of his\r\nFriday night discourses was given on June 20th, 1862. It was on\r\nSiemens’s gas furnaces. He had been down at Swansea watching the\r\nfurnaces in operation, and now proposed to describe their principle. It\r\nwas rather a sad occasion, for it was but too evident that his powers\r\nwere fast waning. Early in the evening he had the misfortune to burn\r\nthe notes he had prepared, and became confused. He concluded with a\r\ntouching personal explanation how with advancing years his memory had\r\nfailed, and that in justice to others he felt it his duty to retire.\r\n\r\nAt intervals he still attempted to work at research. In 1860 he sent a\r\npaper to the Royal Society on the relations of electricity to gravity,\r\nbut, on the advice of Professor (afterwards Sir George) Stokes, it was\r\nwithdrawn. He had also in contemplation some experiments upon the time\r\nrequired in the propagation of magnetism, and began the construction of\r\na complicated instrument, which was never finished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HYPOTHESIS AND EXPERIMENT.]\r\n\r\nHis very last experiment, as recorded in his laboratory notebook, is\r\nof extraordinary interest, as showing how his mind was still at work\r\ninquiring into the borderland of possible phenomena. It was on March\r\n12th, 1862. He was inquiring into the effect of a magnetic field\r\nupon a beam of light, which he was observing with a spectroscope to\r\nascertain whether there was any change produced in the refrangibility\r\nof the light. The entry concludes: “Not the slightest effect on the\r\npolarised or unpolarised ray was observed.” The experiment is of the\r\nhighest interest in magneto-optics. The effect for which Faraday\r\nlooked in vain in 1862 was discovered in 1897 by Zeeman. That Faraday\r\nshould have _conceived_ the existence of this obscure relation between\r\nmagnetism and light is a striking illustration of the acuteness of\r\nmental vision which he brought to bear. Living and working amongst\r\nthe appliances of his laboratory, letting his thoughts play freely\r\naround the phenomena, incessantly framing hypotheses to account for the\r\nfacts, and as incessantly testing his hypotheses by the touchstone of\r\nexperiment, never hesitating to push to their logical conclusion the\r\nideas suggested by experiment, however widely they might seem to lead\r\nfrom the accepted modes of thought, he worked on with a scientific\r\nprevision little short of miraculous. His experiments, even those which\r\nat the time seemed unsuccessful, in that they yielded no positive\r\nresult, have proved to be a mine of amazing richness. The volumes\r\nof his “Experimental Researches” are a veritable treasure-house of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMIDDLE AND LATER LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough to avoid discontinuity the account of Faraday’s researches has\r\nin the previous chapter been followed to their close in 1862, we must\r\nnow return to his middle period of life, when his activities at the\r\nRoyal Institution were at their zenith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BREAKDOWN OF HEALTH.]\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the serious breakdown of Faraday’s health at\r\nthe close of 1839. Dr. Latham, whom he consulted as to his attacks of\r\ngiddiness, wrote to Brande:--\r\n\r\n                                        Grosvenor Street,\r\n                                            December 1, 1839.\r\n\r\n    DEAR BRANDE,--I have been seeing our friend Faraday these two\r\n    or three days, and been looking after his health. I trust he\r\n    has no ailment more than rest of body and mind will get rid\r\n    of. But rest is absolutely necessary for him. Indeed, I think\r\n    it would be hardly prudent for him to lecture again for the\r\n    present. He looks up to his work; but, in truth, he is not fit,\r\n    and if he is pressed he will suddenly break down. When we meet,\r\n    I will talk the matter over with you.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours most sincerely,\r\n                                                      P. M. LATHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advice was taken. He gave up nearly all research work, but tried\r\nto go on with Friday night discourses and afternoon lectures in 1840.\r\nThen came a more serious breakdown, and he rested for nearly four\r\nyears, with the exception of the Christmas lectures in 1841 and a few\r\nFriday discourses in 1842 and 1843. This illness caused him great\r\ndistress of mind, mainly due to an idea that the physicians did not\r\nunderstand his condition. When in this state he sometimes set down\r\npencil notes on scraps of paper to relieve his feelings. One such is\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n    Whereas, according to the declaration of that true man of\r\n    the world Talleyrand, the use of language is to conceal the\r\n    thoughts; this is to declare in the present instance, when I\r\n    say I am not able to bear much talking, it means really, and\r\n    without any mistake, or equivocation, or oblique meaning, or\r\n    implication, or subterfuge, or omission, that I am not able;\r\n    being at present rather weak in the head, and able to work no\r\n    more.\r\n\r\nDuring these times of enforced idleness he used to amuse himself with\r\ngames of skill, with paperwork, and with visits to the theatre and to\r\nthe Zoological Gardens. Mrs. Faraday left the following note:--\r\n\r\n    Michael was one of the earliest members of the Zoological\r\n    Society, and the Gardens were a great resource to him when\r\n    overwrought and distressed in the head. The animals were a\r\n    continual source of interest, and we, or rather I, used to\r\n    talk of the time when we should be able to afford a house\r\n    within _my_ walking distance of the entrance; for I much feared\r\n    he could not continue to live in the Institution with the\r\n    continual calls upon his time and thought; but he always shrank\r\n    from the notion of living away from the R. I.\r\n\r\nHis niece, Miss Reid, told how fond he was of seeing acrobats,\r\ntumblers, dwarfs and giants; even a Punch and Judy show was an\r\nunfailing source of delight. When travelling in Switzerland, as he did\r\non several occasions, accompanied by Mrs. Faraday and her brother,\r\nGeorge Barnard, the artist, he kept a journal, which reveals his\r\nsimple pleasures and enthusiasms. He is delighted with waterfalls and\r\navalanches, watches the cowherd collecting his cows and the shepherd\r\ncalling the sheep, which followed him, leaving the goats to straggle.\r\nOn one such visit (in 1841), in order that he might not be absent on\r\nSunday from his wife, he walked the whole distance from Leukerbad\r\nto Thun, over the Gemmi--a distance of 45 miles--in one day. At\r\nInterlaken, observing that clout-nail-making was practised as a local\r\nindustry, he wrote: “I love a smith’s shop and everything relating to\r\nsmithery. My father was a smith.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IMPRESSIONS OF LIEBIG.]\r\n\r\nIn 1844 he was well enough to attend the British Association meeting at\r\nYork. Liebig, who had also been there, wrote to him three months later\r\nwith some reminiscences. What had struck him most was the tendency\r\nin England to ignore the more purely scientific works and to value\r\nonly those with a “practical” bearing. “In Germany it is quite the\r\ncontrary. Here, in the eyes of scientific men, no value, or at least\r\nbut a trifling one, is placed on the practical results. The enrichment\r\nof science is alone considered worthy of attention.” Liebig further\r\nexpressed himself dissatisfied with the meeting at York. He had been\r\ninterested to make the acquaintance of so many celebrated men, but it\r\nwas, strictly, “a feast given to the geologists, the other sciences\r\nserving only to decorate the table.” Then came a more personal note:--\r\n\r\n    Often do my thoughts wander back to the period which I spent in\r\n    England, among the many pleasant hours of which the remembrance\r\n    of those passed with you and your amiable wife is to me always\r\n    the dearest and most agreeable. With the purest pleasure I\r\n    bring to mind my walk with her, in the botanical garden at\r\n    York, when I was afforded a glance of the richness of her mind;\r\n    what a rare treasure you possess in her! The breakfast in\r\n    the little house with Snow Harris, and Graham, and our being\r\n    together at Bishopthorpe, are still fresh in my memory.\r\n\r\nIf Liebig was disposed to underrate the useful applications of science,\r\nFaraday certainly was not. Though his own research work was carried\r\non with the single aim of scientific progress; though he himself\r\nnever swerved aside into any branch research that might have yielded\r\nmoney; yet he was ever ready to examine, and even to lecture upon,\r\nthe inventions of others. He accepted for the subjects of his Friday\r\nnight discourses all sorts of topics--artificial stone, machinery for\r\npen-making, lithography, Ruhmkorff’s induction coil, a process for\r\nsilvering mirrors, and lighthouse illumination by electric light. His\r\nvery last lecture was on Siemens’s gas-furnaces. He could be just as\r\nenthusiastic over the invention of another as over some discovery of\r\nhis own. With respect to his lecture on the Ruhmkorff coil, Tyndall\r\ndescribes him in a passage which is interesting, as containing an\r\nepithet since adopted for another great man for whom Tyndall had less\r\nrespect than for Faraday:--\r\n\r\n    I well remember the ecstasy and surprise of _the grand old\r\n    man_, evoked by effects which we should now deem utterly\r\n    insignificant.\r\n\r\nBence Jones says:--\r\n\r\n    When he brought the discoveries of others before his hearers,\r\n    one object, and one alone, seemed to determine all he said and\r\n    did, and that was, “without commendation and without censure,”\r\n    to do the utmost that could be done for the discoverer.\r\n\r\nIn so perfect a character it would be marvellous if there were not\r\nsome flaw. His persistent ignoring of Sturgeon, and his attribution\r\nof the invention of the electromagnet to Moll and Henry, whose work\r\nwas frankly based on Sturgeon’s, is simply inexplicable. He failed to\r\nappreciate the greatness of Dalton, and thought him an overrated man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS.]\r\n\r\nAmid all his overflowing kindliness of heart, Faraday preserved other\r\nless obvious traits of character. Any act of injustice or meanness\r\ncalled forth an almost volcanic burst of indignation. Hot flashes\r\nof temper, fierce moments of wrath were by no means unknown. But he\r\nexercised a most admirable self-control, and a habitual discipline\r\nof soul that kept his temper under. Grim and forbidding, and even\r\nexacting he could show himself to an idle or unfaithful servant. There\r\nwere those who feared as well as those who loved and admired him.\r\nDr. Gladstone says of him that he was no “model of all the virtues,”\r\ndreadfully uninteresting, and discouraging to those who feel calm\r\nperfection out of their reach. “His inner life was a battle, with its\r\nwounds as well as its victory.” “It is true also,” he adds, “that\r\nwith his great caution and his repugnance to moral evil, he was more\r\ndisposed to turn away in disgust from an erring companion than to\r\nendeavour to reclaim him.”\r\n\r\nFor thirty years Faraday was the foremost of lecturers on science\r\nin London. From the first occasion when, in 1823, as Sir Roderick\r\nMurchison narrates, he was called upon unexpectedly to act as\r\nsubstitute for Professor Brande at one of his morning lectures at the\r\nRoyal Institution (then held in the subterranean laboratory), down to\r\nthe time of his latest appearance as a lecturer in 1862, he was without\r\na rival as the exponent of natural science.\r\n\r\nAs no man could achieve and retain such a position without possessing\r\nboth natural gifts and appropriate training, it is fitting to inquire\r\nwhat were those gifts and what the training which were so happily\r\nunited in him.\r\n\r\n    I was (he said) a very lively, imaginative person, and could\r\n    believe in the Arabian Nights as easily as in the Encyclopædia;\r\n    but facts were important to me, and saved me. I could trust a\r\n    fact, and always cross-examined an assertion.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first Faraday had an appreciation of the way in which\r\npublic lectures should be given. In his notes of Davy’s fourth lecture\r\nof April, 1812, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    During the whole of these observations his delivery was easy,\r\n    his diction elegant, his tone good, and his sentiments sublime.\r\n\r\nHis own first lecture was given in the kitchen of Abbott’s house, with\r\nhome-made apparatus placed on the kitchen table. To Abbott, after\r\nonly a few weeks of experience at the Royal Institution, he wrote the\r\nletters upon lectures and lecturers, to which allusion was made on p.\r\n15. These show a most remarkably sound perception of the material and\r\nmental furniture requisite for success. From the third and fourth of\r\nthem are culled the following excerpts:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: QUALIFICATIONS OF A LECTURER.]\r\n\r\n    The most prominent requisite to a lecturer, though perhaps\r\n    not really the most important, is a good delivery; for though\r\n    to all true philosophers science and nature will have charms\r\n    innumerable in every dress, yet I am sorry to say that the\r\n    generality of mankind cannot accompany us one short hour\r\n    unless the path is strewed with flowers. In order, therefore,\r\n    to gain the attention of an audience (and what can be more\r\n    disagreeable to a lecturer than the want of it?), it is\r\n    necessary to pay some attention to the manner of expression.\r\n    The utterance should not be rapid and hurried, and consequently\r\n    unintelligible, but slow and deliberate, conveying ideas with\r\n    ease from the lecturer, and infusing them with clearness and\r\n    readiness into the minds of the audience. A lecturer should\r\n    endeavour by all means to obtain a facility of utterance, and\r\n    the power of clothing his thoughts and ideas in language smooth\r\n    and harmonious, and at the same time simple and easy.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the action of the lecturer, it is requisite\r\n    that he should have some, though it does not here bear the\r\n    importance that it does in other branches of oratory; for\r\n    though I know of no species of delivery (divinity excepted)\r\n    that requires less motion, yet I would by no means have a\r\n    lecturer glued to the table or screwed on the floor. He must\r\n    by all means appear as a body distinct and separate from the\r\n    things around him, and must have some motion apart from that\r\n    which they possess.\r\n\r\n    A lecturer should appear easy and collected, undaunted and\r\n    unconcerned, his thoughts about him, and his mind clear and\r\n    free for the contemplation and description of his subject. His\r\n    action should not be hasty and violent, but slow, easy, and\r\n    natural, consisting principally in changes of the posture of\r\n    the body, in order to avoid the air of stiffness or sameness\r\n    that would otherwise be unavoidable. His whole behaviour\r\n    should evince respect for his audience, and he should in no\r\n    case forget that he is in their presence. No accident that\r\n    does not interfere with their convenience should disturb his\r\n    serenity, or cause variation in his behaviour; he should never,\r\n    if possible, turn his back on them, but should give them full\r\n    reason to believe that all his powers have been exerted for\r\n    their pleasure and instruction.\r\n\r\n    Some lecturers choose to express their thoughts\r\n    extemporaneously immediately as they occur to the mind, whilst\r\n    others previously arrange them and draw them forth on paper.\r\n    But although I allow a lecturer to write out his matter, I do\r\n    not approve of his reading it--at least, not as he would a\r\n    quotation or extract.\r\n\r\n    A lecturer should exert his utmost effort to gain completely\r\n    the mind and attention of his audience, and irresistibly to\r\n    make them join in his ideas to the end of the subject. He\r\n    should endeavour to raise their interest at the commencement\r\n    of the lecture, and by a series of imperceptible gradations,\r\n    unnoticed by the company, keep it alive as long as the subject\r\n    demands it. A flame should be lighted at the commencement, and\r\n    kept alive with unremitting splendour to the end. For this\r\n    reason I very much disapprove of breaks in a lecture, and where\r\n    they can by any means be avoided they should on no account find\r\n    place.... For the same reason--namely, that the audience should\r\n    not grow tired--I disapprove of long lectures; one hour is long\r\n    enough for anyone. Nor should they be allowed to exceed that\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n    A lecturer falls deeply beneath the dignity of his character\r\n    when he descends so low as to angle for claps and asks for\r\n    commendation. Yet have I seen a lecturer even at this point. I\r\n    have heard him causelessly condemn his own powers. I have heard\r\n    him dwell for a length of time on the extreme care and niceness\r\n    that the experiment he will make requires. I have heard him\r\n    hope for indulgence when no indulgence was wanted, and I have\r\n    even heard him declare that the experiment now made cannot\r\n    fail, from its beauty, its correctness, and its application,\r\n    to gain the approbation of all.... I would wish apologies to\r\n    be made as seldom as possible, and generally only when the\r\n    inconvenience extends to the company. I have several times seen\r\n    the attention of by far the greater part of the audience called\r\n    to an error by the apology that followed it.\r\n\r\n    ’Tis well, too, when the lecturer has the ready wit and\r\n    the presence of mind to turn any casual circumstance to an\r\n    illustration of his subject. Any particular circumstance that\r\n    has become table-talk for the town, any local advantages or\r\n    disadvantages, any trivial circumstance that may arise in\r\n    company, give great force to illustrations aptly drawn from\r\n    them, and please the audience highly, as they conceive they\r\n    perfectly understand them.\r\n\r\n    Apt experiments (to which I have before referred) ought to\r\n    be explained by satisfactory theory, or otherwise we merely\r\n    patch an old coat with new cloth, and the whole [hole] becomes\r\n    worse. If a satisfactory theory can be given, it ought to be\r\n    given. If we doubt a received opinion, let us not leave the\r\n    doubt unnoticed and affirm our own ideas, but state it clearly,\r\n    and lay down also our objections. If the scientific world is\r\n    divided in opinion, state both sides of the question, and let\r\n    each one judge for himself by noticing the most striking and\r\n    forcible circumstances on each side. Then, and then only, shall\r\n    we do justice to the subject, please the audience, and satisfy\r\n    our honour, the honour of a philosopher.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: USE OF CRITICISM.]\r\n\r\nOne who already had set before himself such high ideals could not\r\nfail at least to attempt to fulfil them. Accordingly, when in 1816 he\r\nbegan to lecture to the City Philosophical Society, he began to attend\r\nan evening class on elocution conducted by Mr. B. H. Smart, though\r\nthe pinch of poverty made it difficult to him to afford the needful\r\nfees. Again, in 1823, previous to taking part in Brande’s laboratory\r\nlectures, he took private lessons in elocution from Smart, at the\r\nrate of half-a-guinea a lesson. After 1827, when he was beginning his\r\nregular courses of lectures in the theatre, he often used to get Mr.\r\nSmart to attend in order to criticise his delivery.\r\n\r\nAmongst the rules found in his manuscript notes were the following:--\r\n\r\n    Never to repeat a phrase.\r\n\r\n    Never to go back to amend.\r\n\r\n    If at a loss for a word, not to ch-ch-ch or eh-eh-eh, but to\r\n    stop and wait for it. It soon comes, and the bad habits are\r\n    broken and fluency soon acquired.\r\n\r\n    Never doubt a correction given to me by another.\r\n\r\nHis niece, Miss Reid, who lived from 1830 to 1840 at the Institution\r\nwith the Faradays, gave the following amongst her recollections:--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Magrath used to come regularly to the morning lectures, for\r\n    the sole purpose of noting down for him any faults of delivery\r\n    or defective pronunciation that could be detected. The list\r\n    was always received with thanks; although his corrections\r\n    were not uniformly adopted, he was encouraged to continue his\r\n    remarks with perfect freedom. In early days he always lectured\r\n    with a card before him with _Slow_ written upon it in distinct\r\n    characters. Sometimes he would overlook it and become too\r\n    rapid; in this case, Anderson had orders to place the card\r\n    before him. Sometimes he had the word _Time_ on a card brought\r\n    forward when the hour was nearly expired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AS LECTURER.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of his recourse to aids in acquiring elocutionary excellence,\r\nhis own style remained simple and unspoiled. “His manner,” says Bence\r\nJones, “was so natural, that the thought of any art in his lecturing\r\nnever occurred to anyone. For his Friday discourses, and for his\r\nother set lectures in the theatre, he always made ample preparation\r\nbeforehand. His matter was always over-abundant. And, if his\r\nexperiments were always successful, this was not solely attributable\r\nto his exceeding skill of hand. For, unrivalled as he was as a\r\nmanipulator, in the cases in which he attempted to show complicated\r\nor difficult experiments, that which was to be shown was always well\r\nrehearsed beforehand in the laboratory. He was exceedingly particular\r\nabout small and simple illustrations. He never merely _told_ his\r\nhearers about an experiment, but _showed_ it to them, however simple\r\nand well known it might be. To a young lecturer he once remarked: ‘If I\r\nsaid to my audience, “This stone will fall to the ground if I open my\r\nhand,” I should open my hand and let it fall. Take nothing for granted\r\nas known; inform the eye at the same time as you address the ear.’ He\r\nalways endeavoured at the outset to put himself _en rapport_ with his\r\naudience by introducing his subject on its most familiar side, and then\r\nleading on to that which was less familiar. Before the audience became\r\naware of any transition, they were already assimilating new facts which\r\nwere thus brought within their range. Nor did he stay his discourse\r\nupon the enunciation of facts merely. Almost invariably, as his\r\nallotted hour drew towards its close, he gave rein to his imagination.\r\nThose who had begun with him on the lower plane of simple facts and\r\ntheir correlations were bidden to consider the wider bearings of\r\nscientific principles and their relations to philosophy, to life, or to\r\nethics. While he never forced a peroration, nor dragged in a quotation\r\nfrom the poets, his own scientific inspiration, as he outlined some\r\nwide-sweeping speculation or suggestion for future discoveries, amply\r\nsupplied the fitting finale. If the rush of his ideas might sometimes\r\nbe compared to tearing through a jungle, it at least never degenerated\r\ninto sermonising; and never, save when he was physically ill, failed to\r\narouse an enthusiastic glow of response in his hearers. ‘No attentive\r\nlistener,’ says Mrs. Crosse, ‘ever came away from one of Faraday’s\r\nlectures without having the limits of his spiritual vision enlarged, or\r\nwithout feeling that his imagination had been stimulated to something\r\nbeyond the mere expression of physical facts.’”\r\n\r\nHe was not one who let himself dwell in illusions. When he did well he\r\nwas perfectly conscious of the fact, and enjoyed a modest satisfaction.\r\nIf he had failed of his best, he was conscious too of that. His\r\ndeliberate act in giving up all other lectures at the time when his\r\nbrain-troubles were gaining upon him, while retaining the Christmas\r\nlectures to juveniles, was thoroughly characteristic. Of one of his\r\nearlier courses of lectures he himself made--about 1832--the following\r\nnote:--\r\n\r\n    The eight lectures on the operations of the laboratory at the\r\n    Royal Institution, April, 1828, were not to my mind. There\r\n    does not appear to be that opportunity of fixing the attention\r\n    of the audience by a single clear, consistent, and connected\r\n    chain of reasoning which occurs when a principle (_sic_) or\r\n    one particular application is made.... I do not think the\r\n    operations of the laboratory can be rendered useful and popular\r\n    in lectures....\r\n\r\nThe matter of these same lectures was, however, the basis of his book\r\non Chemical Manipulation published in 1827. It went through three\r\neditions, and was reprinted in America. But in 1838 he declined to let\r\na new edition be issued, as he considered the work out of date.\r\n\r\nBesides the note quoted above from the Faraday MS. occurs the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n    The six juvenile lectures given Christmas, 1827, were just what\r\n    they ought to have been, both in matter and manner; but it\r\n    would not answer to give an extended course in the same spirit.\r\n\r\nNineteen times did Faraday give the Christmas lectures. Those on the\r\nChemistry of a Candle were given more than once; and were the last he\r\ngave, in 1860. They have been published, as were those on the Forces of\r\nNature. The lectures on Metals he was urged to publish, but declined in\r\nthe following terms:--\r\n\r\n                              Royal Institution, January 3, 1859.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,--Many thanks to both you and Mr. Bentley. Mr.\r\n    Murray made me an unlimited offer like that of Mr. Bentley’s\r\n    many years ago, but for the reasons I am about to give you\r\n    I had to refuse his kindness. He proposed to take them by\r\n    shorthand, and so save me trouble, but I knew that would be a\r\n    thorough failure; even if I cared to give time to the revision\r\n    of the MS., still the lectures without the experiments and\r\n    the vivacity of speaking would fall far behind those in the\r\n    lecture-room as to effect. And then I do not desire to give\r\n    time to them, for money is no temptation to me. In fact, I have\r\n    always loved science more than money; and because my occupation\r\n    is almost entirely personal I cannot afford to get rich. Again\r\n    thanking you and Mr. Bentley, I remain,\r\n\r\n                                        Very truly yours,\r\n                                                  M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN INSPIRED CHILD.]\r\n\r\nOf his lectures Lady Pollock wrote:--\r\n\r\n    He would play with his subject now and then, but very\r\n    delicately; his sport was only just enough to enliven the\r\n    attention. He never suffered an experiment to allure him away\r\n    from his theme. Every touch of his hand was a true illustration\r\n    of his argument.... But his meaning was sometimes beyond the\r\n    conception of those whom he addressed. When, however, he\r\n    lectured to children he was careful to be perfectly distinct,\r\n    and never allowed his ideas to outrun their intelligence. He\r\n    took great delight in talking to them, and easily won their\r\n    confidence. The vivacity of his manner and of his countenance,\r\n    and his pleasant laugh, the frankness of his whole bearing,\r\n    attracted them to him. They felt as if he belonged to them; and\r\n    indeed he sometimes, in his joyous enthusiasm, appeared like an\r\n    inspired child.\r\n\r\n    ... His quick sympathies put him so closely in relation with\r\n    the child that he saw with the boy’s new wonder, and looked,\r\n    and most likely felt for the moment, as if he had never seen\r\n    the thing before. Quick feelings, quick movement, quick\r\n    thought, vividness of expression and of perception, belonged to\r\n    him. He came across you like a flash of light, and he seemed\r\n    to leave some of his light with you. His presence was always\r\n    stimulating.--_St. Paul’s Magazine_, June, 1870.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _British Quarterly Review_ says:--\r\n\r\n    He had the art of making philosophy charming, and this was due\r\n    in no little measure to the fact that to grey-headed wisdom he\r\n    united wonderful juvenility of spirit.... Hilariously boyish\r\n    upon occasion he could be, and those who knew him best knew\r\n    he was never more at home, that he never seemed so pleased,\r\n    as when making an old boy of himself, as he was wont to say,\r\n    lecturing before a juvenile audience at Christmas.\r\n\r\nCaroline Fox (in “Memories of Old Friends”), under date June 13th,\r\n1851, wrote in her journal:--\r\n\r\n    We went to Faraday’s lecture on “Ozone.” He tried the various\r\n    methods of making ozone which Schönbein had already performed\r\n    in our kitchen, and he did them brilliantly. He was entirely at\r\n    his ease, both with his audience and his chemical apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn the diary of H. Crabb Robinson is an appreciation of Faraday of some\r\ninterest:--\r\n\r\n    May 8th, 1840.... Attended Carlyle’s second lecture. It gave\r\n    great satisfaction, for it had uncommon thoughts and was\r\n    delivered with unusual animation.... In the evening heard a\r\n    lecture by Faraday. What a contrast to Carlyle! A perfect\r\n    experimentalist with an intellect so clear. Within his sphere\r\n    _un uomo compito_.\r\n\r\nMany references to Faraday’s lectures occur in the life of Sir Richard\r\nOwen (published 1894), chiefly extracted from Mrs. Owen’s diary. Two or\r\nthree extracts must suffice:--\r\n\r\n    1839, Jan. 8th. At eight o’clock with R. to the Royal\r\n    Institution to hear Faraday lecture on electricity, galvanism,\r\n    and the electric eel. Faraday is the _beau idéal_ of a popular\r\n    lecturer.\r\n\r\n    1845, Jan. 31. To Faraday’s lecture at the Royal Institution.\r\n    The largest crowd I have ever seen there. Many gentlemen were\r\n    obliged to come into the ladies’ gallery, as they could not\r\n    get seats elsewhere. After an exceedingly interesting lecture,\r\n    Faraday said he had a few remarks to make on some new reform\r\n    laws for the Institution. These remarks were admirably made,\r\n    and no one could feel offended, although it was a direct\r\n    attack on those gentlemen who helped to render the ladies very\r\n    uncomfortable, sometimes by filling seats, and often front\r\n    seats, in the part intended only for ladies. Wearing a hat in\r\n    the library was one of the delinquencies, likewise sitting in\r\n    the seats reserved for the directors, who were obliged by their\r\n    office and duties to be last in. Mr. Faraday also remarked\r\n    that the formation of two currents caused by certain gentlemen\r\n    rushing upstairs the instant the lecture was over to fetch\r\n    their lady friends was not conducive to the comfort of those\r\n    coming downstairs. Everything taken very well.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: ROYAL INSTITUTION LECTURES.]\r\n\r\n    1849, May 28th. With R. to Royal Institution. We got there just\r\n    before three, and there was a crowded audience as usual to hear\r\n    Faraday’s lecture. The poor man entered and attempted to speak,\r\n    but he was suffering from inflammation or excessive irritation\r\n    of the larynx, and after some painful efforts to speak, a\r\n    general cry arose of “Postpone,” and someone, apparently in\r\n    authority, made a short speech from the gallery. Mr. Faraday\r\n    still wished to try and force his voice, saying he was well\r\n    aware of the difficulty of getting back the carriages, etc.,\r\n    before the time for the lecture had elapsed, to say nothing of\r\n    the disappointment to some; but every moment the cry increased.\r\n    “No, no; you are too valuable to be allowed to injure yourself.\r\n    Postpone, postpone.” Poor Faraday was quite overcome.\r\n\r\nThe interrupted lecture was resumed after a fortnight’s interval; and\r\nhe made up the full number of lectures by giving two extra discourses,\r\nat one of which the Prince Consort was present.\r\n\r\n    At another lecture [in 1856] Faraday explained the magnet and\r\n    strength of attraction. He made us all laugh heartily; and when\r\n    he threw a coalscuttle full of coals, a poker, and a pair of\r\n    tongs at the great magnet, and they stuck there, the theatre\r\n    echoed with shouts of laughter.\r\n\r\nHis friend De la Rive testified in striking terms to Faraday’s power as\r\na speaker.\r\n\r\n    Nothing can give a notion of the charm which he imparted to\r\n    these improvised lectures, in which he knew how to combine\r\n    animated, and often eloquent, language with a judgment and art\r\n    in his experiments which added to the clearness and elegance\r\n    of his exposition. He exerted an actual fascination upon his\r\n    auditors; and when, after having initiated them into the\r\n    mysteries of science, he terminated his lecture, as he was in\r\n    the habit of doing, by rising into regions far above matter,\r\n    space, and time, the emotion which he experienced did not fail\r\n    to communicate itself to those who listened to him, and their\r\n    enthusiasm had no longer any bounds.\r\n\r\nFaraday remained all his life a keen observer of other lecturers.\r\nVisiting France in 1845, he went to hear Arago give an astronomical\r\nlecture. “He delivered it in an admirable manner to a crowded\r\naudience,” was his comment.\r\n\r\nTo the Secretary of the Institution, who in 1846 consulted him\r\nregarding evening lectures, he said:\r\n\r\n    I see no objection to evening lectures if you can find a fit\r\n    man to give them. As to popular lectures (which at the same\r\n    time are to be _respectable_ and _sound_), none are more\r\n    difficult to find. Lectures which _really teach_ will never be\r\n    popular; lectures which are popular will never _really teach_.\r\n    They know little of the matter who think science is more\r\n    easily to be taught or learned than A B C; and yet who ever\r\n    learned his A B C without pain and trouble? Still, lectures can\r\n    (generally) inform the mind, and show forth to the attentive\r\n    man what he really has to learn, and in their way are very\r\n    useful, especially to the public. I think they might be useful\r\n    to us now, even if they only gave an answer to those who,\r\n    judging by their own earnest desire to learn, think much of\r\n    them. As to agricultural chemistry, it is no doubt an excellent\r\n    and a popular subject, but I rather suspect that those who know\r\n    least of it think that most is known about it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: USE OF MODELS AND CARDS.]\r\n\r\nHis fondness for illustrating obscure points in his lectures by\r\nmodels has been more than once alluded to. He would improvise these\r\nout of wood, paper, wire, or even out of turnips or potatoes, with\r\nmuch dexterity of hand. In one of his unpublished manuscripts, dating\r\nabout 1826, dealing with the then recently discovered phenomena of\r\nelectromagnetism, occurs the following note:--\r\n\r\n    It is best for illustration to have a model of the constant\r\n    position which the needle takes across the wire: _le voila_\r\n    (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nMany such simple models were used in his lectures. He leaned upon them\r\nto aid his defective memory; but they helped his audience quite as much\r\nas they aided him. Reference was made on p. 7 to his use of cards, on\r\nwhich to jot down notes of thoughts that occurred to him. One such runs\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n    Remember to do one thing at once.\r\n\r\n    Also to finish a thing.\r\n\r\n    Also to do a little if I could not do _much_.\r\n\r\n    Pique about mathematics in chemists, and resolution to support\r\n    the character of experiment--as better for the mass. Hence\r\n    origin of the title _Exp. researches_.\r\n\r\n    Influence of authority. Davy and difficulty of steering between\r\n    _self-sufficiency_ and dependance (_sic_) on others.\r\n\r\n    Aim at high things, but not presumptuously.\r\n\r\n    Endeavour to succeed--expect not to succeed.\r\n\r\n    _Criticise_ one’s own view in every way by experiment--if\r\n    possible, leave no objection to be put by others.\r\n\r\nFaraday’s enthusiasm about experimental researches was at times\r\nunrestrained, and always contagious. Dumas describes how Faraday\r\nrepeated for him the experimental demonstration of the action of\r\nmagnetism on light. Having come to the final experiment, Faraday\r\nrubbed his hands excitedly, while his eyes lit up with fire, and his\r\nanimated countenance told the passionate feelings which he brought to\r\nthe discovery of scientific truth. On another occasion Plücker, of\r\nBonn, then on a visit to London, showed Faraday in his own laboratory\r\nthe action of a magnet upon the luminous electric discharge in vacuum\r\ntubes. “Faraday danced round them; and as he saw the moving arches of\r\nlight, he cried: ‘Oh, to live always in it!’” Once a friend met him\r\nat Eastbourne in the midst of a tremendous storm, rubbing his hands\r\ntogether gleefully because he had been fortunate enough to see the\r\nlightning strike the church tower. To the Baroness Burdett-Coutts\r\nhe once wrote inviting her to see some experiments upon spectrum\r\nanalysis in his private room. _The experiments_, he wrote, _will not be\r\nbeautiful except to the intelligent_.\r\n\r\nYet another reminiscence is to be found in the Memorials of Joseph\r\nHenry. It relates, probably, to the date of 1837, when Henry visited\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n    Henry loved to dwell on the hours that he and Bache had spent\r\n    in Faraday’s society. I shall never forget Henry’s account of\r\n    his visit to King’s College, London, where Faraday, Wheatstone,\r\n    Daniell, and he had met to try and evolve the electric spark\r\n    from the thermopile. Each in turn attempted it and failed.\r\n    Then came Henry’s turn. He succeeded, calling in the aid of\r\n    his discovery of the effect of a long interpolar wire wrapped\r\n    around a piece of soft iron. Faraday became as wild as a boy,\r\n    and, jumping up, shouted: “Hurrah for the Yankee experiment!”\r\n\r\nThe following memorandum was found on a slip of paper in Faraday’s\r\n“research drawer”:--\r\n\r\n    THE FOUR DEGREES.\r\n\r\n    The discoverer of a fact.\r\n    The reconciling of it to known principles.\r\n    Discovery of a fact not reconcilable.\r\n    He who refers all to still more general principles.\r\n\r\n                                                        M.F.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FREEDOM OF SPECULATION.]\r\n\r\nFaraday’s mind was of a very individual turn; he could not walk\r\nalong the beaten tracks, but must pursue truth wherever it led him.\r\nHis dogged tenacity for exact fact was accompanied by a perfect\r\nfearlessness of speculation. He would throw overboard without\r\nhesitation the most deeply-rooted notions if experimental evidence\r\npointed to newer ideas. He had learned to doubt the idea of _poles_;\r\nso he outgrew the idea of _atoms_, which he considered an arbitrary\r\nconception. Many who heard his bold speculations and his free coinage\r\nof new terms deemed him vague and loose in thought. Nothing could be\r\nmore untrue. He let his mind play freely about the facts; he framed\r\nthousands of hypotheses, only to let them go by if they were not\r\nsupported by facts. “He is the wisest philosopher,” he said in a\r\nlecture on the nature of matter, “who holds his theory with some\r\ndoubt--who is able to proportion his judgment and confidence to the\r\nvalue of the evidence set before him, taking a fact for a fact and a\r\nsupposition for a supposition, as much as possible keeping his mind\r\nfree from all source of prejudice; or, where he cannot do this (as in\r\nthe case of a theory), remembering that such a source is there.”\r\n\r\nIn one of his later experimental researches he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    As an experimentalist, I feel bound to let experiment guide me\r\n    into any train of thought which it may justify; being satisfied\r\n    that experiment, like analysis, must lead to strict truth if\r\n    rightly interpreted; and believing also that it is in its\r\n    nature far more suggestive of new trains of thought and new\r\n    conditions of natural power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WHY NO SUCCESSOR.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was this very freedom of thought which debarred him from\r\nenlisting other men as collaborators in his researches. His one\r\nassistant for thirty years, Sergeant Anderson, was indeed invaluable\r\nto him for his quality of implicit obedience. Other helpers in the\r\nlaboratory he had none. Apparently he found his researches to be of too\r\nindividual a character to permit him to deputise any part of his work.\r\nHe was never satisfied when told about another’s experiment; he must\r\nperform it for himself. Often a discovery arose from some chance or\r\ntrivial incident of an otherwise unsuccessful experiment. The power of\r\n“lateral vision,” which Tyndall has so strongly emphasised, was a prime\r\nfactor in his successes. That power could not be delegated to any mere\r\nassistant. Many times did outsiders approach him, thinking to bring new\r\nfacts to his notice; never, save on the solitary occasion when a Mr.\r\nWilliam Jenkin drew his attention to the “extra-current” spark seen on\r\nthe breaking of an electric circuit, did such novelties turn out to\r\nbe really new. Alleged discoveries thus brought to him merely plagued\r\nhim. He thought that anyone who had the wit to observe any really new\r\nphenomenon would be the person best qualified to work it out. His\r\nmethod was to work on alone, dwelling amidst his experiments until the\r\nmind, familiarising itself with the facts, was ready to suggest their\r\ncorrelations. It was sometimes urged against him as a complaint that he\r\nnever took up any younger man to train him as his successor, even as\r\nDavy had taken up himself and trained him in scientific work. One of\r\nthe miscellaneous notes, found after his death, throws some light on\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\n    It puzzles me greatly to know what makes the successful\r\n    philosopher. Is it industry and perseverance with a moderate\r\n    proportion of good sense and intelligence? Is not a modest\r\n    assurance or earnestness a requisite? Do not many fail because\r\n    they look rather to the renown to be acquired than to the pure\r\n    acquisition of knowledge, and the delight which the contented\r\n    mind has in acquiring it for its own sake? I am sure I have\r\n    seen many who would have been good and successful pursuers of\r\n    science, and have gained themselves a high name, but that it\r\n    was the name and the reward they were always looking forward\r\n    to--the reward of the world’s praise. In such there is always a\r\n    shade of envy or regret over their minds, and I cannot imagine\r\n    a man making discoveries in science under these feelings. As to\r\n    Genius and its power, there may be cases; I suppose there are.\r\n    I have looked long and often for a genius for our Laboratory,\r\n    but have never found one. But I have seen many who would, I\r\n    think, if they had submitted themselves to a sound self-applied\r\n    discipline of mind, have become successful experimental\r\n    Philosophers.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Becker he wrote:\r\n\r\n    I was never able to make a fact my own without seeing it; and\r\n    the descriptions of the best works altogether failed to convey\r\n    to my mind such a knowledge of things as to allow myself to\r\n    form a judgment upon them. It was so with _new_ things. If\r\n    Grove, or Wheatstone, or Gassiot, or any other told me a new\r\n    fact, and wanted my opinion either of its value, or the cause,\r\n    or the evidence it could give on any subject, I never could say\r\n    anything until I had seen the fact. For the same reason I never\r\n    could work, as some Professors do most extensively, by students\r\n    or pupils. All the work had to be my own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INCOME AND EXPENDITURE.]\r\n\r\nOf Faraday’s social life and surroundings during his meridional and\r\nlater period much might be written. After his great researches of 1831\r\nto 1836 scientific honours flowed in freely upon him, especially from\r\nforeign academies and universities; and the fame he won at home would\r\nhave brought him, had he been so minded, an ample professional fortune\r\nand all the artificial amenities of Society which follow the successful\r\nmoney-maker. From all such mundane “success” he cut himself off when\r\nin 1831 he decided to abandon professional fee-earning, and to devote\r\nhimself to the advancement of science. Probably the tenets of the\r\nreligious body to which he belonged were a leading factor in compelling\r\nthis decision. Not having laid upon him the necessity of providing\r\nfor a family, and accustomed to live in an unostentatious style, he\r\ncould contemplate the future without anxiety. With his pension, his\r\nWoolwich lectures, and his Trinity House appointment, Faraday was in no\r\nsense poor, though his Royal Institution professorship never brought\r\nhim so much as £300 a year until after he was over sixty years of age;\r\nbut on the other hand, his private charities were very numerous. How\r\nmuch of his income was spent in that way can never be known; for the\r\nvery privacy of his deeds of kindness prevented any record from being\r\nkept. Certain it is that his gifts to the aged poor and sick must have\r\namounted to several hundreds of pounds a year; for while his income\r\nfor many years must have averaged at least £1,000 or £1,100, and his\r\ndomestic expenditure could not have much exceeded half that sum, he\r\ndoes not seem to have attempted to save anything. Nor did he grudge\r\ntime or strength to do kindly charitable acts in visiting the sick.\r\n\r\nFrom about the year 1834 he resolutely declined invitations to dinners\r\nand such social gaieties; not, as some averred, from any religious\r\nasceticism, but that he might the more unrestrainedly devote himself to\r\nhis researches. “If,” says Mrs. Crosse, “Babbage, Wheatstone, Grove,\r\nOwen, Tyndall, and a host of other distinguished scientists, were to be\r\nmet very generally in the society of the day, there was one man who was\r\nvery conspicuous by his absence--this was Faraday! His biographers say\r\nthat in earlier years he occasionally accepted Lady Davy’s invitations\r\nto dinner; but I never heard of his going anywhere, except in obedience\r\nto the commands of royalty.” He did indeed occasionally dine quietly\r\nwith Sir Robert Peel or Earl Russell; and of the few public dinners he\r\nattended, he enjoyed most the annual banquet of the Royal Academy of\r\nArts.\r\n\r\nFaraday does not, however, appear to have had any very direct relations\r\nwith the world of art. Once he was consulted by Lord John Russell\r\nas to the removal of Raphael’s cartoons from Hampton Court to the\r\nNational Gallery. His advice was adverse, on account of the penetrating\r\npower of dust. Though a sufficiently good draughtsman to prepare his\r\nown drawings, he had little or no knowledge of the technicalities of\r\npainting. Yet his sensitive and enthusiastic temperament had much in\r\ncommon with that of the artist, and he enjoyed music, especially good\r\nmusic, greatly. In early life he played the flute and knew many songs\r\nby heart. He took bass parts in concerted singing, and is said to have\r\nsung correctly in time and tune. In his circle of acquaintanceship\r\nwere numbered several painters of eminence--Turner, Landseer, and\r\nStanfield. His brother-in-law, Mr. George Barnard, the late well-known\r\nwater-colour artist, has written the following note:--\r\n\r\n    My first and many following sketching trips were made with\r\n    Faraday and his wife. Storms excited his admiration at all\r\n    times, and he was never tired of looking into the heavens. He\r\n    said to me once, “I wonder you artists don’t study the light\r\n    and colour in the sky more, and try more for effect.” I think\r\n    this quality in Turner’s drawings made him admire them so much.\r\n    He made Turner’s acquaintance at Hullmandel’s, and afterwards\r\n    often had applications from him for chemical information about\r\n    pigments. Faraday always impressed upon Turner and other\r\n    artists the great necessity there was to experiment for\r\n    themselves, putting washes and tints of all their pigments in\r\n    the bright sunlight, covering up one half, and noticing the\r\n    effect of light and gases on the other....\r\n\r\n    Faraday did not fish at all during these country trips, but\r\n    just rambled about geologising or botanising.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCIENCE, LITERATURE, AND ART.]\r\n\r\nEarlier in his career, Faraday and his brother-in-law used to enjoy\r\nconversaziones of artists, actors, and musicians at Hullmandel’s.\r\nSometimes they went up the river in Hullmandel’s eight-oar boat,\r\ncamping gipsy-wise on the banks for dinner, and enjoying the singing\r\nof Signor Garcia and his wife and of his daughter, afterwards Madame\r\nMalibran. From these things, too, he withdrew very largely when he\r\nceased to dine out, though he still liked to hear the opera and\r\nto visit the theatre. Curiously enough, he seems to have had very\r\nlittle in common with literary men. In the last half of the previous\r\ncentury there had been many intimate relations between the leaders\r\nof literature and those of science. The circle which included Watt,\r\nBoulton, and Wedgwood included also Priestley and Erasmus Darwin. In\r\nour own time the names of Darwin, Huxley, Hooker, and Tyndall are to\r\nbe found in conjunction with those of Tennyson, Browning, and Jowett.\r\nBut the biographies of literary men and artists of the period from 1830\r\nto 1850 bear few references to Faraday. He moved in his own world, and\r\nthat a world very much apart from literature or art. In his method of\r\nworking he was indeed an artist, often feeling his way rather than\r\ncalculating it, and arriving at his conclusions by what seemed insight\r\nrather than by any direct process of reasoning. The discovery of\r\ntruth comes about in many ways; and if Faraday’s method in science\r\nwas artistic rather than scientific, it was amply justified by the\r\nbrilliant harvest of discoveries which it enabled him to reap.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Faraday never took out any patents for his\r\ndiscoveries; indeed, whenever in his investigations he seemed to come\r\nnear to the point where they began to possess a marketable value\r\nfrom their application to the industries, he left them, to pursue\r\nhis pioneering inquiries in other branches. He sought, indeed, for\r\nprinciples rather than for processes, for facts new to science rather\r\nthan for merchantable inventions. When he had made the discovery\r\nof magneto-electric induction--the basis of all modern electric\r\nengineering--he carried the research to the point of constructing\r\nseveral experimental machines, and then abruptly turned away with these\r\nmemorable words:--\r\n\r\n    I have rather, however, been desirous of discovering new facts\r\n    and new relations dependent on magneto-electric induction than\r\n    of exalting the force of those already obtained; being assured\r\n    that the latter would find their full development hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRACTICAL UTILITIES.]\r\n\r\nSeveral times was Faraday known, when asked about the possible utility\r\nof some new scientific discovery, to quote Franklin’s rejoinder: “What\r\nis the use of a baby?”\r\n\r\nIt is narrated of him that on one occasion, at a Trinity House dinner,\r\nhe and the Duke of Wellington had a little friendly chat, in the\r\ncourse of which the Duke advised Faraday to give his speculations “a\r\npractical turn as far as possible”--“a suggestion,” said Faraday, who\r\nalways spoke of the veteran with pleasure, “full of weight, coming\r\nfrom such a man.” Faraday was, however, the last to despise the\r\nimportance of industrial applications of science. In his unpublished\r\nmanuscripts at the Royal Institution there are some curious references\r\nto trials which he made of a meat-canning process, invented about\r\n1848 by a Mr. Goldner, of Finsbury. He also had fancies for other\r\ndomestic applications, including wine-making. He used himself to\r\nbind his own note-books. To a Mr. Woolnough, who had written a book\r\non the marbling of paper, he wrote a letter saying how much interest\r\nhe felt in the subject, “because of its associations with my early\r\noccupation of bookbinding; and also because of the very beautiful\r\nprinciples of natural philosophy which it involves.” He even, on one\r\noccasion, produced a home-made pair of boots. His devotion to the\r\npractical applications of science is attested by his untiring work for\r\nimproving the lighthouses of our coast. It is believed that his death\r\nwas accelerated by a severe cold caught when on a visit of lighthouse\r\ninspection during stormy weather.\r\n\r\nFaraday was never ashamed of the circumstance of his having risen\r\nfrom a humble origin. In his letters he not unfrequently alludes to\r\nthings that remind him of his bookbinding experiences, or of boyish\r\nepisodes in his father’s smithy. Yet he had none of the vulgar\r\npride of ascent which too often dogs the path of the self-made man.\r\nSevere self-discipline and genuine humility prevented either undue\r\nproclamation or awkward reticence respecting his early life. His elder\r\nbrother Robert was a gasfitter. Faraday was not ashamed to help him to\r\nsecure work in his trade, nor to give him the benefit of his scientific\r\naid in perfecting appliances for ventilating by gas-burners. The\r\nfollowing characteristic story was told by Frank Barnard:--\r\n\r\n    Robert was throughout life a warm friend and admirer of his\r\n    younger brother, and not a whit envious at seeing himself\r\n    passed in the social scale by him. One day he was sitting in\r\n    the Royal Institution just previous to a lecture by the young\r\n    and rising philosopher, when he heard a couple of gentlemen\r\n    behind him descanting on the natural gifts and rapid rise of\r\n    the lecturer. The brother--perhaps not fully apprehending the\r\n    purport of their talk--listened with growing indignation while\r\n    one of them dilated on the lowness of Faraday’s origin. “Why,”\r\n    said the speaker, “I believe he was a mere shoeblack at one\r\n    time.” Robert could endure this no longer; but turning sharply\r\n    round he demanded: “Pray, sir, did he ever black your shoes?”\r\n    “Oh! dear no, certainly not,” replied the gentleman, much\r\n    abashed at the sudden inquisition into the facts of the case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPIRIT MEDIUMS EXPOSED.]\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Faraday came before the public in a novel manner--as the\r\nexposer of the then rampant charlatanry of table-turning and\r\nspirit-rapping. The _Athenæum_ for July 2nd contains a long letter\r\nfrom him on table-turning. He experimentally investigated the alleged\r\nphenomena as produced by three skilful mediums in _séances_ at the\r\nhouse of a friend. His mechanical skill was more than a match, however,\r\nfor that of the supposed spirits. When the observers assembled around\r\nthe table placed their hands in the orthodox way upon the table-top,\r\nthe table turned, apparently without any effort on the part of any\r\none of the party. This was eminently satisfactory for the spirits.\r\nBut when Faraday interposed between each hand and the table-top a\r\nsimple roller-mechanism which, if any individual in the circle applied\r\nmuscular forces tending to turn it, instantly indicated the fact, the\r\ntable remained immovable. Faraday wrote merely describing the facts,\r\nand saying that the test apparatus was now on public view at 122,\r\nRegent Street. He ends thus:--\r\n\r\n    I must bring this long description to a close. I am a little\r\n    ashamed of it, for I think, in the present age, and in this\r\n    part of the world, it ought not to have been required.\r\n    Nevertheless, I hope it may be useful. There are many whom I\r\n    do not expect to convince; but I may be allowed to say that I\r\n    cannot undertake to answer such objections as may be made. I\r\n    state my own convictions as an experimental philosopher, and\r\n    find it no more necessary to enter into controversy on this\r\n    point than on any other in science, as the nature of matter, or\r\n    inertia, or the magnetisation of light, on which I may differ\r\n    from others. The world will decide sooner or later in all such\r\n    cases, and I have no doubt very soon and correctly in the\r\n    present instance.\r\n\r\nThis exposure excited great interest at the time, and there was an\r\nactive correspondence in _The Times_. The spiritualists, instead of\r\nappreciating the services to truth rendered by the man of science,\r\nrailed bitterly at him. Even the refined and noble spirit of Mrs.\r\nBrowning was so dominated by the superstition of the moment that, as\r\nshown by her recently published letters, she denounced Faraday in\r\nsingularly acrimonious terms, and taunted him for shallow materialism!\r\nWhat Faraday thought of the hubbub evoked by his action is best learned\r\nfrom a letter which he addressed three weeks later to his friend\r\nSchönbein:--\r\n\r\n    I have not been at work except in turning the tables upon\r\n    the table-turners, nor should I have done that, but that so\r\n    many inquiries poured in upon me, that I thought it better to\r\n    stop the inpouring flood by letting all know at once what my\r\n    views and thoughts were. What a weak, credulous, incredulous,\r\n    unbelieving, superstitious, bold, frightened, what a ridiculous\r\n    world ours is, as far as concerns the mind of man. How full\r\n    of inconsistencies, contradictions, and absurdities it is.\r\n    I declare that, taking the average of many minds that have\r\n    recently come before me (and apart from that spirit which God\r\n    has placed in each), and accepting for a moment that average\r\n    as a standard, I should far prefer the obedience, affections,\r\n    and instinct of a dog before it. Do not whisper this, however,\r\n    to others. There is One above who worketh in all things, and\r\n    who governs even in the midst of that misrule to which the\r\n    tendencies and powers of men are so easily perverted.\r\n\r\nHe declined an invitation in 1855 to see manifestations by the medium\r\nHome, saying that he had “lost too much time about such matters\r\nalready.” Nine years later the Brothers Davenport invited him to\r\nwitness their cabinet “manifestations.” Again he declined, and added:\r\n“I will leave the spirits to find out for themselves how they can move\r\nmy attention. I am tired of them.”\r\n\r\nIn this year he wrote to _The Times_ respecting the disgraceful and\r\ninsanitary condition of the river Thames. In _Punch_ of the following\r\nweek appeared a cartoon representing Faraday presenting his card to old\r\nFather Thames, who rises holding his nose to avoid the stench.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FAILURE OF MEMORY.]\r\n\r\nWith increasing age the infirmity of loss of memory made itself\r\nincreasingly felt. He alludes frequently to this in his letters. To\r\none friend who upbraided him gently for not having replied to a letter\r\nhe says: “Do you remember that I forget?” To another he says he is\r\nforgetting how to spell such words as “withhold” and “successful.” To\r\nMatteucci, in 1849, he bemoans how, after working for six weeks at\r\ncertain experiments, he found, on looking back to his notes, he had\r\nascertained all the same results eight or nine months before, and had\r\nentirely forgotten them! In the same year he wrote to Dr. Percy:--\r\n\r\n    I cannot be on the Committee; I avoid everything of that kind,\r\n    that I may keep my stupid head a little clear. As to being on a\r\n    Committee and not working, that is worse still.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, in a letter to his niece, Mrs. Deacon, filled mainly with\r\nreligious thoughts, he says: “My worldly faculties are slipping away\r\nday by day. Happy is it for all of us that the true good lies not in\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nFrom the journals of Walter White comes the following anecdote under\r\ndate December 22nd, 1858:--\r\n\r\n    Mr. Faraday called to enquire on the part of Sir Walter\r\n    Trevelyan whether a MS. of meteorological observations made\r\n    in Greenland would be acceptable. The question answered, I\r\n    expressed my pleasure at seeing him looking so well, and asked\r\n    him if he were writing a paper for the Royal. He shook his\r\n    head. “No: I am too old.” “Too old? Why, age brings wisdom.”\r\n    “Yes, but one may overshoot the wisdom.” “You cannot mean that\r\n    you have outlived your wisdom?” “Something like it, for my\r\n    memory is gone. If I make an experiment, I forget before twelve\r\n    hours are over whether the result was positive or negative; and\r\n    how can I write a paper while that is the case? No, I must\r\n    content myself with giving my lectures to children.”\r\n\r\nFrom another source we learn of a hitherto unrecorded incident which\r\nhappened to Mr. Joseph Newton, for some time an assistant in the Royal\r\nMint. While arranging some precious material on the Royal Institution\r\ntheatre lecture-table, previous to a lecture on the Mint and minting\r\noperations by Professor Brande, Mr. Newton noticed an elderly, spare,\r\nand very plainly-dressed individual watching his movements. Imagining\r\nthat this person was a superior messenger of the Institution, Mr.\r\nNewton volunteered some information as to the coinage of gold. “I\r\nsuppose,” said the Mint employee, “you have been some years at the\r\nRoyal Institution?” “Well, yes, I have, a good many,” responded the\r\ndilapidated one. “I hope they treat you pretty liberally--I mean, that\r\nthey give you a respectable ‘screw,’ for that is the main point.” “Ah!\r\nI agree with you there. I think that the labourer is worthy of his\r\nhire, and I shouldn’t mind being paid a little better.” Mr. Newton’s\r\nsurprise, on returning to the Royal Institution in the evening, to find\r\nthat the man whom he had so recently patronised was none other than\r\nthe illustrious but modest Michael Faraday can better be imagined than\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nA pretty instance, given on the authority of Lady Pollock, may be\r\nrecorded of the feeling aroused by Faraday’s presence when he returned\r\nto his accustomed seat in the lecture-room of the Royal Institution,\r\nafter a protracted absence occasioned by illness:--\r\n\r\n    As soon as his presence was recognised, the whole audience\r\n    rose simultaneously and burst into a spontaneous utterance of\r\n    welcome, loud and long. Faraday stood in acknowledgment of this\r\n    enthusiastic greeting, with his fine head slightly bent; and\r\n    then a certain resemblance to the pictures and busts of Lord\r\n    Nelson, which was always observable in his countenance, was\r\n    very apparent. His hair had grown white and long, his face had\r\n    lengthened, and the agility of his movement was gone. The eyes\r\n    no longer flashed with the fire of the soul, but they still\r\n    radiated kindly thought; and ineffaceable lines of intellectual\r\n    force and energy were stamped upon his face.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HONOURS OFFERED AND DECLINED.]\r\n\r\nIn 1857 he was offered the Presidency of the Royal Society. A painting\r\npreserved in the rooms of the Royal Society records the scene when Lord\r\nWrottesley, Grove, and Gassiot waited upon him as a deputation from\r\nthe Council, to press on him his acceptance of the highest place which\r\nscience has to offer. He hesitated and finally declined, even as he\r\nhad declined the suggestion of knighthood years before. “Tyndall,” he\r\nsaid in private to his successor, “I must remain plain Michael Faraday\r\nto the last; and let me now tell you, that if I accepted the honour\r\nwhich the Royal Society desires to confer upon me, I could not answer\r\nfor the integrity of my intellect for a single year.” He also declined\r\nthe Presidency of the Royal Institution, which he had served for fifty\r\nyears. His one desire was for rest. “The reverent affection of his\r\nfriends was,” said Tyndall, “to him infinitely more precious than all\r\nthe honours of official life.”\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to Faraday’s tender and chivalrous regard\r\nfor his wife. Extracts from two letters, written in 1849 and 1863\r\nrespectively, must here suffice to complete the story:--\r\n\r\n                                    Birmingham, Dr. Percy’s:\r\n                              Thursday evening, September 13, 1849.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAREST WIFE,--I have just left Dr. Percy’s hospitable\r\n    table to write to you, my beloved, telling you how I have been\r\n    getting on. I am very well, excepting a little faceache; and\r\n    very kindly treated here. They all long most earnestly for your\r\n    presence, for both Mrs. and Dr. Percy are anxious you should\r\n    come; and this I know, that the things we have seen would\r\n    delight you, but then I doubt your powers of running about as\r\n    we do; and though I know that if time were given you could\r\n    enjoy them, yet to press the matter into a day or two would\r\n    be a failure. Besides this, after all, there is no pleasure\r\n    like the tranquil pleasures of home, and here--even here--the\r\n    moment I leave the table, I wish I were with you IN QUIET. Oh!\r\n    what happiness is ours! My runs into the world in this way only\r\n    serve to make me esteem that happiness the more. I mean to be\r\n    at home on Saturday night, but it may be late first, so do not\r\n    be surprised at that; for if I can, I should like to go on an\r\n    excursion to the Dudley caverns, and that would take the day....\r\n\r\n    Write to me, dearest. I shall get your letter on Saturday\r\n    morning, or perhaps before.\r\n\r\n    Love to father, Margery, and Jenny, and a thousand loves to\r\n    yourself, dearest,\r\n\r\n                              From your affectionate husband,\r\n                                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        5, Claremont Gardens, Glasgow:\r\n                                            Monday, August 14, 1863.\r\n\r\n    DEAREST,--Here is the fortnight complete since I left you and\r\n    the thoughts of my return to _our home_ crowd in strongly upon\r\n    my mind. Not that we are in any way uncared for, or left by\r\n    our dear friends, save as I may desire for our own retirement.\r\n    Everybody has overflowed with kindness, but you know their\r\n    manner, and their desire, by your own experience with me. I\r\n    long to see you, dearest, and to talk over things together, and\r\n    call to mind all the kindness I have received. My head is full,\r\n    and my heart also, but my recollection rapidly fails, even as\r\n    regards the friends that are in the room with me. You will have\r\n    to resume your old function of being a pillow to my mind, and a\r\n    rest, a happy-making wife.\r\n\r\n    My love to my dear Mary. I expect to find you together, but do\r\n    not assume to know how things may be.\r\n\r\n    Jeannie’s love with mine, and also Charlotte’s, and a great\r\n    many others which I cannot call to mind.\r\n\r\n    Dearest, I long to see and be with you, whether together or\r\n    separate.\r\n\r\n                              Your husband, very affectionate,\r\n                                                          M. FARADAY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE WIFE AND THE QUEEN.]\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the Queen, at the suggestion of Prince Albert, who much\r\nesteemed and valued Faraday’s genius, placed at his disposal for life\r\na comfortable house on the green near Hampton Court. Faraday’s only\r\nhesitation in accepting the offer was a doubt whether he could afford\r\nthe needful repairs. On a hint of this reaching the Queen, she at once\r\ndirected that it should be put into thorough repair inside and out. He\r\nstill kept his rooms at the Royal Institution, and continued to live\r\nthere occasionally.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing infirmities of age, his anxieties for his wife\r\nseemed to be the only trouble that marred the serenity of his thought.\r\nLady Pollock’s narrative gives the following particulars:--\r\n\r\n    Sometimes he was depressed by the idea of his wife left without\r\n    kin--of the partner of his hopes and cares deprived of him. She\r\n    had been the first love of his ardent soul; she was the last;\r\n    she had been the brightest dream of his youth, and she was the\r\n    dearest comfort of his age; he never ceased for an instant to\r\n    feel himself happy with her; and he never for one hour ceased\r\n    to care for her happiness. It was no wonder, then, that he felt\r\n    anxiety about her. But he would rally from such a trouble with\r\n    his great religious trust, and looking at her with moist eyes,\r\n    he would say, “I must not be afraid; you will be cared for, my\r\n    wife; you will be cared for.”\r\n\r\n    There are some who remember how tenderly he used to lead her to\r\n    her seat at the Royal Institution when she was suffering from\r\n    lameness; how carefully he used to support her; how watchfully\r\n    he used to attend all her steps. It did the heart good to see\r\n    his devotion, and to think what the man was and what he had\r\n    been.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--FARADAY’S HOME AT HAMPTON COURT.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLOSE OF SCIENTIFIC CAREER.]\r\n\r\nGradually his powers waned. He gave his last juvenile lectures at\r\nChristmas, 1860; and in October, 1861, being now seventy years of age,\r\nhe resigned his Professorship, while retaining the superintendence\r\nof the laboratory. “Nothing,” he wrote to the managers, “would make\r\nme happier in the things of this life than to make some scientific\r\ndiscovery or development, and by that to justify the Board in their\r\ndesire to retain me in my position here.” His last research in the\r\nlaboratory was made on March 12, 1862. On June 20th he gave his last\r\nFriday night discourse--on Siemens’s gas furnaces. He had, as his\r\nnotes show, already made up his mind to announce his retirement, and\r\nthe lecture was a sad and touching occasion, for the failure of his\r\npowers was painfully evident. He continued for two years longer, and\r\nwith surprising activity, to work for Trinity House on the subject of\r\nlighthouse illumination by the electric light. In 1865 he resigned\r\nthese duties to Dr. Tyndall. In 1864 he resigned his eldership in\r\nthe Sandemanian church. In March, 1865, he resigned the position of\r\nsuperintendent of the house and laboratories of the Royal Institution.\r\nHe continued to attend the Friday evening meetings; but his tottering\r\ncondition of frame and mind was apparent to all. All through the winter\r\nof 1865 and 1866 he became very feeble. Yet he took an interest in Mr.\r\nWilde’s description of his new magneto-electric machine. Almost the\r\nlast pleasure he showed on any scientific matter was when viewing the\r\nlong spark of a Holtz’s influence machine. He still enjoyed looking\r\nat sunsets and storms. All through the summer and autumn of 1866 and\r\nthe spring of 1867 his physical powers waned. He was faithfully and\r\nlovingly tended by his wife and his devoted niece, Jane Barnard.\r\nHe was scarcely able to move, but his mind “overflowed” with the\r\nconsciousness of the affectionate regard of those around him. He\r\ngradually sank into torpor, saying nothing and taking little notice of\r\nanything. Sitting in his chair in his study, he died peacefully and\r\npainlessly on the 26th of August, 1867. On the 30th of August he was\r\nquietly buried in Highgate Cemetery, his remains being committed to the\r\nearth, in accordance with the custom of the religious body to which he\r\nbelonged, in perfect silence. None but personal friends were present,\r\nthe funeral being by his own verbal and written wishes strictly simple\r\nand private. A simple unadorned tombstone marks the last resting-place\r\nof Michael Faraday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nVIEWS ON THE PURSUIT OF SCIENCE AND ON EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Faraday and the scientific men of his time there subsisted\r\nmany various relations. The influence which he exerted as a lecturer\r\nand as an experimental investigator was unique; but, apart from\r\nsuch influences, those relations were mainly confined to individual\r\nfriendships. With the organisation of science he had relatively very\r\nlittle to do. We have seen how highly he prized the honour of admission\r\nto the Fellowship of the Royal Society; and it remains to be told of\r\nthe gratification with which he accepted the scientific honours which\r\nhe received from almost every academy and university in Europe. Yet\r\nhe took little part in the work of scientific societies as such. Four\r\nyears after his election as F.R.S. he served on the Council, and he\r\nremained on till 1831. He served again in 1833 and 1835. He was not,\r\nhowever, satisfied with the management of the Royal Society, nor with\r\nthe way in which its Fellowship was at that time bestowed on men who\r\nhad no real claims on science, but were nominated through influence.\r\nEchoes of this discontent are to be found in various pamphlets of the\r\nday by Moll, Babbage, South, and others. Faraday, who edited Moll’s\r\npamphlet on the “Decline of Science,” is believed to have had an even\r\nlarger share in its production. In 1830 the really scientific men\r\namongst the Fellows desired to place Sir John Herschel as President;\r\nthe less scientific preferred the Duke of Sussex. Faraday took the\r\nunusual step of speaking on the question, advocating the principle\r\nthat eminence in science should be the sole qualification for the\r\nPresidency. At the same meeting Herschel moved, and Faraday seconded,\r\na plan for reforming the Council by nominating a list of fifty Fellows\r\nfrom whose number the Council should be chosen. They carried their\r\nplan, and Faraday’s name was amongst those so selected to serve. But\r\nthe presidential election went in favour of the Duke of Sussex by 119\r\nto 110 votes. After 1835 Faraday never served again on the Council. In\r\n1843 he wrote to Matteucci:--\r\n\r\n    I think you are aware that I have not attended at the Royal\r\n    Society, either meetings or council, for some years. Ill health\r\n    is one reason, and another that I do not like the present\r\n    constitution of it, and want to restrict it to scientific men.\r\n    As these my opinions are not acceptable, I have withdrawn from\r\n    any management in it (still sending scientific communications\r\n    if I discover anything I think worthy). This, of course,\r\n    deprives me of power there.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REFORM IN THE ROYAL SOCIETY.]\r\n\r\nTwo months earlier he wrote to Grove, who at that time was carrying out\r\nthe long-needed reforms, sympathising, but declining to co-operate:--\r\n\r\n                                        Royal Institution,\r\n                                            December 21, 1842.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR GROVE,--... As to the Royal Society, you know my\r\n    feeling towards it is for what it has been, and I hope may be.\r\n    Its present state is not wholesome. You are aware that I am\r\n    not on the council, and have not been for years, and have been\r\n    to no meeting there for years; but I do hope for better times.\r\n    I do not wonder at your feeling--all I meant to express was a\r\n    wish that its circumstances and character should improve, and\r\n    that it should again become a desirable reunion of _all_ really\r\n    scientific men. It has done much, is now doing much, in some\r\n    parts of science, as its magnetic observations show, and I hope\r\n    will some day become altogether healthy.\r\n\r\n                              Ever, my dear Grove, yours sincerely,\r\n                                                          M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough he continued down to 1860 to send researches for publication\r\nto the Royal Society, he seldom attended its meetings.[56] He was not\r\neven present in November, 1845, on the occasion of the reading of his\r\npaper on the action of the magnet on light. In 1857 he declined the\r\nPresidency, though urged by the unanimous wish of the Council, as\r\nnarrated on p. 225.\r\n\r\nThough in the meridian of his active life, he took no part in the\r\nfounding of the British Association in 1831, but was at the Oxford\r\nmeeting in 1832, being one of the four scientific men (p. 65) selected\r\nto receive the honorary degree of D.C.L. on that occasion. He also\r\ncommunicated a paper on Electro-chemical Decomposition to the B.A.\r\nmeeting at Cambridge in 1833. He acted as president of the Chemical\r\nSection of the Association in 1837 at Liverpool, and in 1846 at\r\nSouthampton; and he was chosen as vice-president of the Association\r\nitself in the years 1844, at York (p. 224); 1849, at Birmingham (p.\r\n256); and 1853, at Hull. He delivered evening discourses in 1847,\r\nat Oxford, on Magnetic and Diamagnetic Phenomena; and in 1849, at\r\nBirmingham, on Mr. Gassiot’s Battery. He also contributed to the\r\nproceedings at the meetings at Ipswich in 1851 and at Liverpool in 1854.\r\n\r\nHis comparative aloofness from scientific organisations arose probably\r\nfrom the exceedingly individual nature of his own researches--to which\r\nallusion was made on p. 242--rather than from any lack of sympathy.\r\nHe had no jealousy of co-operation in science. To Tyndall, then at\r\nMarburg, he wrote in 1850 rejoicing at the circumstance that the work\r\non the magnetic properties of crystals was being taken up by others.\r\n“It is wonderful,” he says, “how much good results from different\r\npersons working at the same matter. Each one gives views and ideas new\r\nto the rest. When science is a republic, then it gains; and though I am\r\nno republican in other matters, I am in that.” Other causes there were,\r\ndoubtless, tending to his isolation, amongst them an old jealousy, now\r\nlong dead, against the Royal Institution on the part of some of the\r\nFellows of the Royal Society. Above all, probably, was his detestation\r\nof controversy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRIORITY IN SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRIORITY IN PUBLICATION.]\r\n\r\nPriority in scientific discovery was a matter which deeply concerned\r\none whose life was devoted to scientific pioneering. To any question\r\nas to scientific priority between himself and other workers he was\r\nkeenly sensitive. This was, indeed, natural in one who had voluntarily\r\nrelinquished fortune, and retired from lucrative professional work,\r\nin the sole and single aim of advancing natural knowledge. His\r\nsingle-minded and sensitive nature made him particularly scrupulous\r\nin all such matters, and his early experiences must have added to the\r\nalmost excessive keenness of his perceptions. Having had in 1823,\r\nwhen still merely assistant to Davy, to bear the double burden of a\r\nserious misunderstanding with Dr. Wollaston as to the originality of\r\nhis discovery of the electro-magnetic rotations, and of a serious\r\nestrangement from his master arising out of the liquid chlorine\r\ndiscovery--an estrangement which threatened to cause his election to\r\nthe Royal Society to be indefinitely postponed--he was in later life\r\nespecially precise in dating and publishing his own researches. In\r\n1831 there arose, concerning his great discovery of magneto-electric\r\ninduction, a curious misunderstanding. His discovery was, as we have\r\nseen, made in September and October. He collected his results and\r\narranged them in the splendid memoir--the first in the series of\r\n“Experimental Researches in Electricity”--which was read at the Royal\r\nSociety on November 24th. The _résumé_ of his work, which he wrote\r\nfive days later to Phillips, is given on pages 114–117. A fortnight\r\nlater he wrote a shorter and hasty letter in the same way to his\r\nfriend, M. Hachette of Paris--a letter which Faraday subsequently\r\nwell termed “unfortunate,” in view of the consequences that followed.\r\nM. Hachette, a week later, communicated Faraday’s letter to the\r\nAcadémie des Sciences on December 26th. It was published in _Le\r\nTemps_ of December 28th. At that date the complete memoir read to\r\nthe Royal Society was not yet printed or circulated. The consequence\r\nwas that two Italian physicists, MM. Nobili and Antinori, seeing the\r\nbrief letter, and “considering that the subject was given to the\r\nphilosophical world for general pursuit,” immediately began researches\r\non magneto-electric induction in ignorance of Faraday’s full work.\r\nTheir results they embodied in a paper, in which they claimed to\r\nhave “verified, extended, and, perhaps, rectified the results of the\r\nEnglish philosopher,” accusing him of errors both in experiment and\r\ntheory, and even of a breach of good faith as to what he had said\r\nabout Arago’s rotations. This paper they dated January 31st, 1832;\r\nbut it was published in the belated number of the _Antologia_ for\r\nNovember, 1831, where its appearance at an apparently earlier date\r\nthan Faraday’s original paper in the _Philosophical Transactions_ made\r\nmany Continental readers suppose that the researches of Nobili and\r\nAntinori preceded those of Faraday. In June, 1832, Faraday published\r\nin the _Philosophical Magazine_ a translation of Nobili’s memoir, with\r\nhis own annotations; and later in the year he wrote to Gay Lussac a\r\nlong letter on the errors of Nobili and Antinori. He showed how, in\r\nspite of his efforts to clear up the misunderstanding, in spite of\r\nhis having sent several months previously to MM. Nobili and Antinori\r\ncopies of his original papers, no correction or retractation had\r\nbeen made by them; and he concluded by a dignified protest that none\r\nmight say he had been too hasty to write that which might have been\r\navoided. It may be taken that the rule now recognised as to priority\r\nof scientific publication--namely, that it dates from the day when the\r\ndiscoverer communicates it formally to any of the recognised learned\r\nsocieties--was virtually established by Faraday’s example. It will\r\nbe remembered that writing to De la Rive in 1845, to tell him of his\r\ndiamagnetic discoveries, he begged him to keep the matter secret,\r\nadding: “I ought (in order to preserve the respect due to the Royal\r\nSociety) not to write a description to any one until the paper has\r\nbeen received or even read there.” To younger men he inculcated the\r\nnecessity of proper and prompt publication of their researches if they\r\nwould reap the benefit of their work. To Sir William Crookes, then a\r\nrising young chemist, he said: “Work, Finish, Publish.” Writing in 1853\r\nto Professor Matteucci, who had been annoyed with him for allowing\r\nDu Bois Reymond, with whom Matteucci had had some controversy about\r\npriority, to dedicate his book to him, Faraday says: “Who has not to\r\nput up in his day with insinuations and misrepresentations in the\r\naccounts of his proceedings given by others, bearing for the time the\r\npresent injustice, which is often unintentional, and often originates\r\nin hasty temper, and committing his fame and character to the judgment\r\nof the men of his own and future time?”... “I see that that moves\r\nyou which would move me most--namely, the imputation of a want of\r\ngood faith--and I cordially sympathise with any one who is so charged\r\nunjustly. Such cases have seemed to me almost the only ones for which\r\nit is worth while entering into controversy.”... “These polemics of the\r\nscientific world are very unfortunate things; they form the great stain\r\nto which the beautiful edifice of scientific truth is subject. _Are\r\nthey inevitable?_”\r\n\r\nControversy whether in religion or science was to him alike detestable.\r\nHe took no part in politics. A letter to Tyndall (see “Faraday as a\r\nDiscoverer,” p. 39), written after the latter had told him of a rather\r\nheated discussion at the British Association meeting in 1855, speaks of\r\nhis own efforts at forbearance. He says:--\r\n\r\n    These great meetings, of which I think very well altogether,\r\n    advance science chiefly by bringing scientific men together\r\n    and making them to know and be friends with each other; and I\r\n    am sorry when that is not the effect in every part of their\r\n    course.... The real truth never fails ultimately to appear....\r\n    It is better to be blind to the results of partisanship, and\r\n    quick to see good will. One has more happiness in oneself in\r\n    endeavouring to follow the things that make for peace. You can\r\n    hardly imagine how often I have been heated in private when\r\n    opposed, as I have thought unjustly and superciliously, and yet\r\n    I have striven, and succeeded I hope, in keeping down replies\r\n    of the like kind. And I know I have never lost by it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HATRED OF CONTROVERSY.]\r\n\r\nDuring the years when he was examining the apparatus of rival inventors\r\nfor lighthouse illumination, he could calmly hear them described as\r\nMr. So-and-So’s electric lights, all the while knowing that it was\r\nhis own discovery of magneto-electric induction which had made the\r\nmechanical production of electric light possible. Yet he fired up if\r\nanyone dared to revive the priority dispute between Davy and Stephenson\r\nas to the invention of the safety lamp. “Disgraceful subject,” was\r\nhis own comment. In his dispute with Snow Harris as to the design of\r\nlightning rods, in which, as it is now known, Snow Harris was right;\r\nin his dispute with Airy over the curved lines of force; in his minor\r\ndifficulties over Hare’s pile and Becquerel’s magnetic observations,\r\nnone could either assert his own position with more simple dignity, nor\r\nadmit with greater frankness the rights of his rival.\r\n\r\nTo Hare he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    You must excuse me, however, for several reasons from answering\r\n    it [Hare’s letter] at any length; the first is my distaste for\r\n    controversy, which is so great that I would on no account our\r\n    correspondence should acquire that character. I have often\r\n    seen it do great harm, and yet remember few cases in natural\r\n    knowledge where it has helped much either to pull down error or\r\n    advance truth. Criticism, on the other hand, is of much value.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect how large a part of his experimental researches was\r\ndevoted to establishing the relations between the various forces of\r\nnature, we cannot but think that Faraday must have regarded with\r\nsomewhat mixed feelings the publication in 1846 of Sir William Grove’s\r\nvolume on the Correlation of Forces. He had, in June, 1834, given a\r\ncourse of lectures on the mutual relation of chemical and electrical\r\nphenomena, and had dealt therein with the conversion of chemical and\r\nelectrical power into heat, and had speculated on the inclusion of\r\ngravitation in these mutual relations. In 1853 Faraday marked the old\r\nlecture notes of these lectures with his initials, and endorsed them\r\nwith the words “Correlation of Physical Forces.” Probably none rejoiced\r\nmore than he that Grove had undertaken the work of popularising the\r\nnotion which for a score of years had been familiar to himself. Yet\r\nhe was keen to resent an unjust reflection, as is shown by his letter\r\nto Richard Phillips, republished in Vol. II. of the “Experimental\r\nResearches,” p. 229, respecting Dr. John Davy’s Life of Sir Humphry.\r\n\r\nFaraday has himself left on record (p. 10) that when he wrote to Davy\r\nasking to be taken into his employment, his motive was his desire “to\r\nescape from trade, which I thought vicious and selfish, and to enter\r\ninto the service of Science, which, I imagined, made its pursuers\r\namiable and liberal.” Davy had smiled at this boyish notion, and had\r\ntold him that the experience of a few years would correct his ideas.\r\nYears afterwards he spoke of this matter to Mrs. Andrew Crosse in an\r\ninterview which she has recorded:--\r\n\r\n    After viewing the ample appliances for experimental research,\r\n    and feeling much impressed by the scientific atmosphere of the\r\n    place, I turned and said, “Mr. Faraday, you must be very happy\r\n    in your position and with your pursuits, which elevate you\r\n    entirely out of the meaner aspects and lower aims of common\r\n    life.”\r\n\r\n    He shook his head, and with that wonderful mobility of\r\n    countenance which was characteristic, his expression of\r\n    joyousness changed to one of profound sadness, and he replied:\r\n    “When I quitted business and took to science as a career, I\r\n    thought I had left behind me all the petty meannesses and small\r\n    jealousies which hinder man in his moral progress; but I found\r\n    myself raised into another sphere, only to find poor human\r\n    nature just the same everywhere--subject to the same weaknesses\r\n    and the same self-seeking, however exalted the intellect.”\r\n\r\n    These were his words as well as I can recollect; and, looking\r\n    at that good and great man, I thought I had never seen a\r\n    countenance which so impressed me with the characteristic of\r\n    perfect unworldliness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HONOURS AND TITLES.]\r\n\r\nProbably few men have ever been recipients of so many scientific\r\nhonours as Faraday. Beginning in the year 1823 with his election as a\r\ncorresponding member of the Académie des Sciences of Paris, and as an\r\nhonorary member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, the list of\r\nhis diplomas and distinctions--some ninety-seven in number--ended in\r\n1864 with his election as Associate of the Royal Academy of Sciences of\r\nNaples. It included honours from almost every academy and university\r\nof Europe. These honours Faraday valued very highly; and whilst he\r\nconsigned his various gold medals to a mere wooden box, his diplomas\r\nwere kept with the utmost care in a special diploma book, in which they\r\nwere mounted and indexed. To Mr. Spring Rice, who in 1838 asked him for\r\na list of his titles, he replied, enclosing the list, and adding this\r\nremark: “One title, namely that of F.R.S., was sought and paid for;\r\nall the rest are spontaneous offerings of kindness and goodwill from\r\nthe bodies named.” Years afterwards he was asked by Lord Wrottesley\r\nto advise the Government as to how the position of science or of the\r\ncultivators of science in England might be improved. The letter is so\r\ncharacteristic that it cannot be spared:--\r\n\r\n                              Royal Institution: March 10, 1854.\r\n\r\n    MY LORD,--I feel unfit to give a deliberate opinion on the\r\n    course it might be advisable for the Government to pursue\r\n    if it were anxious to improve the position of science and\r\n    its cultivators in our country. My course of life, and the\r\n    circumstances which make it a happy one for me, are not those\r\n    of persons who conform to the usages and habits of society.\r\n    Through the kindness of all, from my Sovereign downwards,\r\n    I have that which supplies all my need; and in respect of\r\n    honours, I have, as a scientific man, received from foreign\r\n    countries and sovereigns those which, belonging to very limited\r\n    and select classes, surpass in my opinion anything that it is\r\n    in the power of my own to bestow.\r\n\r\n    I cannot say that I have not valued such distinctions; on the\r\n    contrary, I esteem them very highly, but I do not think I have\r\n    ever worked for or sought after them. Even were such to be now\r\n    created here, the time is past when these would possess any\r\n    attraction for me....\r\n\r\n    Without thinking of the effect it might have upon distinguished\r\n    men of science, or upon the minds of those who, stimulated\r\n    to exertion, might become distinguished, I do think that a\r\n    government should, _for its own sake_, honour the men who do\r\n    honour and service to the country. I refer now to honours only,\r\n    not to beneficial rewards. Of such honours, I think, there\r\n    are none. Knighthoods and baronetcies are sometimes conferred\r\n    with such intentions, but I think them utterly unfit for that\r\n    purpose. Instead of conferring distinction, they confound the\r\n    man who is one of twenty, or perhaps fifty, with hundreds of\r\n    others. They depress rather than exalt him, for they tend to\r\n    lower the especial distinction of mind to the commonplace\r\n    of society. An intelligent country ought to recognise the\r\n    scientific men amongst its people as a class. If honours are\r\n    conferred upon eminence in any class, as that of the law or\r\n    the army, they should be in this also. The aristocracy of\r\n    the class should have other distinctions than those of lowly\r\n    and high-born, rich and poor, yet they should be such as to\r\n    be worthy of those whom the sovereign and the country should\r\n    delight to honour; and, being rendered very desirable, and even\r\n    enviable, in the eyes of the aristocracy by birth, should be\r\n    unattainable except to that of science. Thus much, I think,\r\n    the Government and the country ought to do, for their own sake\r\n    and the good of science, more than for the sake of the men who\r\n    might be thought worthy of such distinction. The latter have\r\n    attained to their fit place, whether the community at large\r\n    recognise it or not....\r\n\r\n    I have the honour to be, my lord, your very faithful servant,\r\n\r\n                                        M. FARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOW SCIENCE CAN BE HONOURED.]\r\n\r\nTo Professor Andrews he wrote in 1843 in a similar strain:--\r\n\r\n    I have always felt that there is something degrading in\r\n    offering rewards for intellectual exertion, and that societies\r\n    or academies, or even kings and emperors, should mingle in the\r\n    matter does not remove the degradation, for the feeling which\r\n    is hurt is a point above their condition, and belongs to the\r\n    respect which a man owes to himself.... Still, I think rewards\r\n    and honours _good_ if properly distributed; but they should be\r\n    given for what a man has done, and not offered for what he is\r\n    to do.\r\n\r\nWhen a friend wrote to him on hearing a rumour that he had himself been\r\nknighted, his reply, published years after in the _London Review_, was:\r\n“I am happy that I am not a Sir, and do not intend (if it depends upon\r\nme) to become one. By the Prussian knighthood[57] I do feel honoured;\r\nin the other I should not.”\r\n\r\nOn one occasion he commented rather sarcastically upon the British\r\nGovernment and its stinginess as compared with those of all other\r\ncivilised countries in its aids to scientific progress. This complaint\r\nis equally justified to-day. To many it may be news that England pays\r\nto its Astronomer Royal--who must obviously be a person of very high\r\nscientific qualifications--a salary less than those paid to the five\r\nassistant under-secretaries in the Colonial and Foreign Offices; less\r\nthan that paid to the sergeants-at-arms in the Houses of Parliament;\r\nless than that paid to the person appointed Director of Clothing in the\r\nWar Office. Enlightened England!\r\n\r\nFaraday did not deem the pursuit of science to be necessarily\r\nincompatible with what he termed “professional business”--that\r\nis, expert work. Until the day when he abandoned all professional\r\nengagements, so as to devote himself to researches, he had been\r\nreceiving a considerable and growing income from this source. But\r\nhe objected to the indignities to which this work exposed him from\r\nlawyers, who would not understand that he took no partisan view. He\r\ncould not endure the browbeating of cross-examining counsel. The late\r\nLord Cardwell was witness to a gentle but crushing reproof which he\r\nonce administered to a barrister who attempted to bully him. A writer\r\nin the _British Quarterly Review_ attributes to a specific case his\r\ndetermination to cease expert work.\r\n\r\n    He gave evidence once in a judicial case, when the scientific\r\n    testimony, starting from given premises, was so diverse that\r\n    the presiding judge, in summing up launched something like a\r\n    reproach at the scientific witnesses. “Science has not shone\r\n    this day,” was his lordship’s remark. From that time forth\r\n    no one ever saw Faraday as a scientific witness before a law\r\n    tribunal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: UNIVERSITY DEGREES IN SCIENCE.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the honours received by Faraday there was one of which,\r\nin 1838, he said that he felt it equal to any other he had\r\nreceived--namely, that of Member of the Senate of the University of\r\nLondon, to which position he was nominated in 1836 by the Crown. For\r\ntwenty-seven years he remained a senator, and when, in 1859, the\r\nproject for creating degrees in science was on foot, he was one of\r\nthe committee who drew up a report and scheme of examination for the\r\nSenate. To the Rev. John Barlow he wrote on this matter:--\r\n\r\n    The Senate of the University accepted and approved of the\r\n    report of the Committee for Scientific Degrees, so that that\r\n    will go forward (if the Government approve), and will come into\r\n    work next year. It seems to give much satisfaction to all who\r\n    have seen it, though the subject is beset with difficulties;\r\n    for when the depth and breadth of science came to be\r\n    considered, and an estimate was made of how much a man ought to\r\n    know to obtain a right to a degree in it, the amount in words\r\n    seemed to be so enormous as to make me hesitate in demanding it\r\n    from the student; and though in the D.S. one could divide the\r\n    matter and claim eminence in one branch of science, rather than\r\n    good general knowledge in all, still in the B.S., which is a\r\n    progressive degree, a more extended though a more superficial\r\n    acquaintance seemed to be required. In fact, the matter is\r\n    so new, and there is so little that can serve as a previous\r\n    experience in the founding and arranging these degrees, that\r\n    one must leave the whole endeavour to shape itself as the\r\n    practice and experience accumulates.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1863, his feebleness impelled him to resign this position, he\r\nwrote to Dr. Carpenter:--\r\n\r\n    The position of a senator is one that should not be held by\r\n    an inactive man to the exclusion of an active one. It has\r\n    rejoiced my heart to see the progress of the University, and\r\n    of education under its influence and power; and that delight I\r\n    hope to have so long as life shall be spared to me.\r\n\r\nHe had little sympathy with either text-book science or with mere\r\nexaminations. “I have far more confidence,” he wrote, “in the one man\r\nwho works mentally and bodily at a matter than in the six who merely\r\ntalk about it. Nothing is so good as an experiment which, whilst\r\nit sets error right, gives an absolute advancement in knowledge.”\r\nIn another place he wrote:--“Let the imagination go, guarding it\r\nby judgment and principles, but holding it in and directing it by\r\nexperiment.” For book-learned chemistry and mere chemical theory, apart\r\nfrom experimental facts, he had an undisguised contempt. Writing to\r\nGeneral Portlock on the subject of chemical education, he stated that\r\nhe had been one of the Senate of the University of London appointed to\r\nconsider especially the best method of examination. They had decided\r\non examination by papers, accompanied by _vivâ voce_. “We think,” he\r\nadded, “that no numerical value can be attached to the questions,\r\nbecause everything depends on _how they are answered_.” Then, referring\r\nto the teaching at Woolwich, he says, “My instructions always have\r\nbeen to look to the note-books for the result.” “Lectures alone cannot\r\nbe expected to give more than a general idea of this most extensive\r\nbranch of science, and it would be too much to expect that young men\r\nwho at the utmost hear only fifty lectures on chemistry should be\r\nable to answer with much effect, in writing, to questions set down on\r\npaper, when we know by experience that daily work for eight hours in\r\n_practical laboratories_ for _three months_ does not go very far to\r\nconfer such ability.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCIENCE AND THE UNIVERSITIES.]\r\n\r\nHe had, at an earlier date, declined to be appointed as examiner in the\r\nUniversity. He had previously declined the professorship of chemistry\r\nin University College; and he had also declined the chemical chair in\r\nthe University of Edinburgh. This was not, however, from any want of\r\nsympathy with university work, or failure to appreciate the ideal of a\r\nuniversity as a seat of learning. Writing to Tyndall, in 1851, about\r\nanother university--that at Toronto--he said: “I trust it is a place\r\nwhere a man of science and a true philosopher is required, and where,\r\nin return, such a man would be nourished and cherished in proportion to\r\nhis desire to advance natural knowledge.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time he had an exceeding repugnance to the custom of\r\nexpecting candidates for professorial chairs to produce “testimonials”\r\nof their qualifications. When his intimate friend Richard Phillips was\r\na candidate for the very chair which Faraday refused at University\r\nCollege, Faraday declined on principle to give a testimonial. “I should\r\nindeed have thought,” he added, “his character had been known to\r\nbe such that it would rather have been degraded than established by\r\ncertificates.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in 1851, he told Tyndall, then an applicant for the Chair of\r\nPhysics at Toronto, that he had in every case refused for many years\r\npast to give any on the application of candidates. “Nevertheless,” he\r\nadded, “I wish to say that when I am asked about a candidate by those\r\nwho have the choice or appointment, I never refuse to answer.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCIENCE IN EDUCATION.]\r\n\r\nOn general education, Faraday’s ideas were much in advance of his\r\ntime. From the epoch when as a young man he lectured to the City\r\nPhilosophical Society on the means of obtaining knowledge and on mental\r\ninertia, down to the close of his career, he consistently advocated\r\nthe cultivation of the experimental method and the use of science as\r\na means of training the faculties. A concise account of his views is\r\nto be found in the lecture he gave in 1854 before the Prince Consort\r\non “Mental Education,” a lecture which prescribes the self-educating\r\ndiscipline of scientific study and experiment as a means of correcting\r\ndeficiency of judgment. It included a powerful plea for suspense of\r\njudgment and for the cultivation of the faculty of proportionate\r\njudgment. In 1862 he was examined at some length by the Royal\r\nCommissioners upon Public Schools. With them he pleaded strongly for\r\nthe introduction of science into the school curricula; and when asked\r\nat what age it might be serviceable to introduce science-teaching,\r\nreplied: “I think one can hardly tell that until after experience for\r\nsome few years. All I can say is this that at my juvenile lectures at\r\nChristmas time I have never found a child too young to understand\r\nintelligently what I told him; they came to me afterwards with\r\nquestions which proved their capability.”\r\n\r\nOne passage from the close of a lecture given in 1858 deserves to be\r\nrecorded for its fine appreciation of “the kind of education which\r\nscience offers to man”:--\r\n\r\n    It teaches us to be neglectful of nothing, not to despise\r\n    the _small_ beginnings--they precede of necessity _all great\r\n    things_.... It teaches a continual comparison of the _small\r\n    and great_, and that under differences almost approaching\r\n    the infinite, for the small as often contains the great in\r\n    principle as the great does the small; and thus the mind\r\n    becomes comprehensive. It teaches to deduce principles\r\n    carefully, to hold them firmly, or to suspend the judgment,\r\n    to discover and obey _law_, and by it to be bold in applying\r\n    to the greatest what we know of the smallest. It teaches us,\r\n    first by tutors and books, to learn that which is already known\r\n    to others, and then by the light and methods which belong to\r\n    science to learn for ourselves and for others; so making a\r\n    fruitful return to man in the future for that which we have\r\n    obtained from the men of the past. Bacon in his instruction\r\n    tells us that the scientific student ought not to be as the\r\n    ant, who gathers merely, nor as the spider who spins from her\r\n    own bowels, but rather as the bee who both gathers and produces.\r\n\r\n    All this is true of the teaching afforded by any part of\r\n    physical science. Electricity is often called wonderful,\r\n    beautiful; but it is so only in common with the other forces of\r\n    nature. The beauty of electricity or of any other force is not\r\n    that the power is mysterious, and unexpected, touching every\r\n    sense at unawares in turn, but that it is under _law_, and that\r\n    the taught intellect can even now govern it largely. The human\r\n    mind is placed above, and not beneath it, and it is in such a\r\n    point of view that the mental education afforded by science is\r\n    rendered super-eminent in dignity, in practical application and\r\n    utility; for by enabling the mind to apply the natural power\r\n    through law, it conveys the gifts of God to man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ON MATHEMATICS.]\r\n\r\nA peculiar interest attaches to Faraday’s attitude towards the study\r\nof mathematics. He who had never had any schooling beyond the common\r\nschool of his parish had not advanced beyond the simplest algebra in\r\nhis mastery over symbolic reasoning. Several times in his “Experimental\r\nResearches” he deplores what he termed “my imperfect mathematical\r\nknowledge.” Of Poisson’s theory of magnetism he said: “I am quite unfit\r\nto form a judgment.” Dr. Scoffern repeats a pleasantry of Faraday’s\r\nhaving on a certain occasion boasted that he had once in the course of\r\nhis life performed a mathematical operation--when he turned the handle\r\nof Babbage’s calculating machine. Certain it is that he went through\r\nthe whole of his magnificent researches without once using even a sine\r\nor a cosine, or anything more recondite than the simple rule-of-three.\r\nHe expressed the same kind of regret at his unfamiliarity with the\r\nGerman language--“the language of science and knowledge,” as he\r\ntermed it in writing to Du Bois Reymond--which prevented him from\r\nreading the works of Professor “Ohms.” Nevertheless he valued the\r\nmathematical powers of others, and counselled Tyndall to work out his\r\nexperimental results, “so that the mathematicians may be able to take\r\nit up.” Yet he never relaxed his preference for proceeding along the\r\nlines of experimental investigation. His curious phrase (p. 239) as\r\nto his pique respecting mathematics is very significant, as is also\r\nhis note of jubilation in his letter to Phillips (p. 117) at finding\r\nthat pure experiment can successfully rival mathematics in unravelling\r\nthe mysteries which had eluded the efforts of Poisson and Arago.\r\nHe himself attributed to his defective memory his want of hold upon\r\nsymbolic reasoning. To Tyndall he wrote in 1851, when thanking him for\r\na copy of one of his scientific memoirs:--\r\n\r\n    Such papers as yours make me feel more than ever the loss of\r\n    memory I have sustained, for there is no reading them, or at\r\n    least retaining the argument, under such deficiency.\r\n\r\n    Mathematical formulæ more than anything require quickness and\r\n    surety in receiving and retaining the true value of the symbols\r\n    used; and when one has to look back at every moment to the\r\n    beginning of a paper, to see what H or A or B mean, there is\r\n    no making way. Still, though I cannot hold the whole train of\r\n    reasoning in my mind at once, I am able fully to appreciate\r\n    the value of the results you arrive at, and it appears to me\r\n    that they are exceedingly well established and of very great\r\n    consequence. These elementary laws of action are of so much\r\n    consequence in the development of the nature of a power which,\r\n    like magnetism, is as yet new to us.\r\n\r\nAgain to Clerk Maxwell, in 1857, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n    There is one thing I would be glad to ask you. When a\r\n    mathematician engaged in investigating physical actions and\r\n    results has arrived at his own conclusions, may they not be\r\n    expressed in common language as fully, clearly, and definitely\r\n    as in mathematical formulæ? If so, would it not be a great boon\r\n    to such as we to express them so--translating them out of their\r\n    hieroglyphics that we also might work upon them by experiment?\r\n    I think it must be so, because I have always found that you\r\n    could convey to me a perfectly clear idea of your conclusions,\r\n    which, though they may give me no full understanding of the\r\n    steps of your process, gave me the results neither above nor\r\n    below the truth, and so clear in character that I can think and\r\n    work from them.\r\n\r\n    If this be possible, would it not be a good thing if\r\n    mathematicians, writing on these subjects, were to give us\r\n    their results in this popular useful working state as well as\r\n    in that which is their own and proper to them?\r\n\r\nThe achievement of Faraday in finding for the expression of\r\nelectromagnetic laws means which, though not symbolic, were simple,\r\naccurate, and in advance of the mathematics of his time, has been\r\nalluded to on page 217. Liebig, in his discourse on “Induction and\r\nDeduction,” refers to Faraday thus:--\r\n\r\n    I have heard mathematical physicists deplore that Faraday’s\r\n    records of his labours were difficult to read and understand,\r\n    that they often resembled rather abstracts from a diary. But\r\n    the fault was theirs, not Faraday’s. To physicists who have\r\n    approached physics by the road of chemistry, Faraday’s memoirs\r\n    sound like an admirably beautiful music.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MAXWELL AND VON HELMHOLTZ.]\r\n\r\nVon Helmholtz, in his Faraday lecture of 1881, has also touched on this\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n    Now that the mathematical interpretation of Faraday’s\r\n    conceptions regarding the nature of electric and magnetic\r\n    forces has been given by Clerk Maxwell, we see how great a\r\n    degree of exactness and precision was really hidden behind the\r\n    words which to Faraday’s contemporaries appeared either vague\r\n    or obscure; and it is in the highest degree astonishing to\r\n    see what a large number of general theorems, the methodical\r\n    deduction of which requires the highest powers of mathematical\r\n    analysis, he found by a kind of intuition, with the security of\r\n    instinct, without the help of a single mathematical formula.\r\n\r\nTwo other passages from Von Helmholtz are worthy of being added:--\r\n\r\n    And now, with a quite wonderful sagacity and intellectual\r\n    precision, Faraday performed in his brain the work of a great\r\n    mathematician without using a single mathematical formula.\r\n    He saw with his mind’s eye that magnetised and dielectric\r\n    bodies ought to have a tendency to contract in the direction\r\n    of the lines of force, and to dilate in all directions\r\n    perpendicular to the former, and that by these systems of\r\n    tensions and pressures in the space which surrounds electrified\r\n    bodies, magnets, or wires conducting electric currents, all\r\n    the phenomena of electrostatic, magnetic, electromagnetic\r\n    attraction, repulsion, and induction could be explained,\r\n    without recurring at all to forces acting directly at a\r\n    distance. This was the part of his path where so few could\r\n    follow him; perhaps a Clerk Maxwell, a second man of the same\r\n    power and independence of intellect, was needed to reconstruct\r\n    in the normal methods of science the great building the plan of\r\n    which Faraday had conceived in his mind, and attempted to make\r\n    visible to his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n    Nobody can deny that this new theory of electricity and\r\n    magnetism, originated by Faraday and developed by Maxwell, is\r\n    in itself well consistent, in perfect and exact harmony with\r\n    all the known facts of experience, and does not contradict any\r\n    one of the general axioms of dynamics, which have been hitherto\r\n    considered as the fundamental truths of all natural science,\r\n    because they have been found valid, without any exception, in\r\n    all known processes of nature.\r\n\r\nAnd, after dealing with the phenomena discussed by Faraday, Von\r\nHelmholtz adds these pregnant words:--\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless, the fundamental conceptions by which Faraday\r\n    was led to these much-admired discoveries have not received\r\n    an equal amount of consideration. They were very divergent\r\n    from the trodden path of scientific theory, and appeared\r\n    rather startling to his contemporaries. His principal aim was\r\n    to express in his new conceptions only facts, with the least\r\n    possible use of hypothetical substances and forces. This was\r\n    really an advance in general scientific method, destined to\r\n    purify science from the last remnants of metaphysics. Faraday\r\n    was not the first, and not the only man, who had worked in\r\n    this direction, but perhaps nobody else at his time did it so\r\n    radically.\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell said of him:\r\n\r\n    The way in which Faraday made use of his lines of force in\r\n    co-ordinating the phenomena of electric induction shows him to\r\n    have been a mathematician of high order, and one from whom the\r\n    mathematicians of the future may derive valuable and fertile\r\n    methods.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting to include in this review of Faraday’s place in relation\r\nto the mathematical side of physics some words of Lord Kelvin, taken\r\nfrom his preface to the English edition of Hertz’s “Electric Waves”:--\r\n\r\n    Faraday, with his curved lines of electric force, and\r\n    his dielectric efficiency of air and of liquid and solid\r\n    insulators, resuscitated the idea of a medium through which,\r\n    and not only through which but _by_ which, forces of attraction\r\n    or repulsion, seemingly acting at a distance, are transmitted.\r\n\r\n    The long struggle of the first half of the eighteenth century\r\n    was not merely on the question of a medium to serve for\r\n    gravific mechanism, but on the correctness of the Newtonian\r\n    law of gravitation as a matter of fact, however explained. The\r\n    corresponding controversy in the nineteenth century was very\r\n    short, and it soon became obvious that Faraday’s idea of the\r\n    transmission of electric force by a medium not only did not\r\n    violate Coulomb’s law of relation between force and distance,\r\n    but that, if real, it must give a thorough explanation of that\r\n    law. Nevertheless, after Faraday’s discovery of the different\r\n    specific inductive capacities of different insulators, twenty\r\n    years passed before it was generally accepted in Continental\r\n    Europe. But before his death, in 1867, he had succeeded in\r\n    inspiring the rising generation of the scientific world\r\n    with something approaching to faith that electric force is\r\n    transmitted by a medium called ether, of which, as had been\r\n    believed by the whole scientific world for forty years, light\r\n    and radiant heat are transverse vibrations. Faraday himself\r\n    did not rest with this theory of electricity alone. The very\r\n    last time I saw him at work at the Royal Institution was in\r\n    an underground cellar, which he had chosen for freedom from\r\n    disturbance, and he was arranging experiments to test the\r\n    time of propagation of magnetic force from an electromagnet\r\n    through a distance of many yards of air to a fine steel needle,\r\n    polished to reflect light; but no result came from those\r\n    experiments. About the same time, or soon after, certainly not\r\n    long before the end of his working time, he was engaged (I\r\n    believe at the Shot Tower, near Waterloo Bridge, on the Surrey\r\n    side) in efforts to discover relations between gravity and\r\n    magnetism, which also led to no result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KELVIN’S APPRECIATION.]\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin, who was himself the first to perceive that Faraday’s ideas\r\nwere not inconsistent with mathematical expression, and to direct Clerk\r\nMaxwell and others to this view, had, in 1854, delighted the old man\r\nby bringing mathematical support to the conception of lines of force.\r\nIn 1857 he sent to Faraday a copy of one of his papers, and received\r\nin acknowledgment a letter of warm encouragement, which, however, does\r\nnot appear to have been preserved. Lord Kelvin’s reply is its own best\r\ncommentary:--\r\n\r\n    Such expressions from you would be more than a sufficient\r\n    reward for anything I could ever contemplate doing in science.\r\n    I feel strongly how little I have done to deserve them, but\r\n    they will encourage me with a stronger motive than I have\r\n    ever had before to go on endeavouring to see in the direction\r\n    you have pointed, which I long ago learned to believe is the\r\n    direction in which we must look for a deeper insight into\r\n    nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS VIEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Glasites or Sandemanians is given to a small sect of\r\nChristians which separated from the Scottish Presbyterian Church\r\nabout 1730 under the leadership of the Rev. John Glas. Most of the\r\ncongregations which sprang up in England were formed in consequence\r\nof the dissemination of the writings and by the preaching of Robert\r\nSandeman, son-in-law and successor of Glas. Hence the double name. The\r\nSandemanian Church in London was constituted about 1760. It still has\r\na chapel in Barnsbury, though the sect as a whole--never numerous--has\r\ndwindled to a small remnant.[58] The religious census of 1851 showed\r\nbut six congregations in England and six in Scotland. As it never was\r\na proselytising body, it is probable that it has diminished since that\r\ndate. John Glas was deposed in 1728 by the Presbyterian Courts from his\r\nposition as minister in the Scottish Church, because he taught that\r\nthe Church should be governed only by the doctrines of Christ and His\r\napostles, and not be subject to any League or Covenant. He held that\r\nthe formal establishment by any nation of a professed religion was\r\nthe subversion of primitive Christianity; that Christ did not come to\r\nestablish any worldly authority, but to give a hope of eternal life to\r\nHis people whom He should choose of His own sovereign will; that “the\r\nBible,” and it alone, with nothing added to it nor taken away from it\r\nby man, was the sole and sufficient guide for each individual, at all\r\ntimes and in all circumstances; that faith in the divinity and work\r\nof Christ is the gift of God, and that the evidence of this faith is\r\nobedience to the commandment of Christ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SANDEMANIAN CREED.]\r\n\r\nThe tenets of Glas are somewhat obscure and couched in mystical\r\nlanguage. They prescribe a spiritual union which binds its members into\r\none body as a Church without its being represented by any corresponding\r\noutward ecclesiastical polity. He died in 1773. Sandeman, who spent\r\nmost of his life in preaching these doctrines, died about the same time\r\nin New England. He caused to be inscribed on his tomb that “he boldly\r\ncontended for the ancient faith that the bare death of Jesus Christ,\r\nwithout a deed or thought on the part of man, is sufficient to present\r\nthe chief of sinners spotless before God.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A PRIMITIVE CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nThe Sandemanians try--so far as modern conditions permit--to live up\r\nto the practice of the Christian Church as it was in the time of the\r\nApostles. At their chapel they “broke bread” every Lord’s day in the\r\nforenoon, making this a common meal between the morning and afternoon\r\nservices, and taking their places by casting lots. And weekly, at\r\ntheir simple celebration of the Lord’s Supper at the close of the\r\nafternoon service, before partaking, they collect money for the support\r\nof the poor and for expenses. In some places they dined together at\r\none another’s houses instead of at the chapel. “They esteem the lot\r\nas a sacred thing. The washing of the feet is also retained: not, it\r\nwould seem, on any special occasion, but the ablution is performed\r\n‘whenever it can be an act of kindness to a brother to do so.’ Another\r\npeculiarity of this religious body is their objection to second\r\nmarriages.”[59] Members are received into the Church on the confession\r\nof sin and profession of faith made publicly at one of the afternoon\r\nservices. In admitting a new member they give the kiss of charity.\r\nThey deem it wrong to save up money; “the Lord will provide” being an\r\nessential item of faith. Traces of this curious fatalism may be found\r\nin one of Faraday’s letters to his wife (p. 52). He seems always to\r\nhave spent his surplus income on charity. The Sandemanians have neither\r\nordained ministers nor paid preachers. In each congregation, however,\r\nthere are chosen elders (presbyters or bishops), of whom there must\r\nalways be a plurality, and of whom two at least must be present at\r\nevery act of discipline. The elders take it in turns to preside at the\r\nworship, and are elected by the unanimous choice of the congregation.\r\nThe sole qualification for this office, which is unpaid, is that\r\nearnestness of purpose and sincerity of life which would have been\r\nrequired in Apostolic times for the office of bishop or presbyter. No\r\ndifference of opinion is tolerated, but is met by excommunication,\r\nwhich amongst families so connected by marriage produces much\r\nunhappiness, since they hold to the Apostle’s injunction, “With such an\r\none, no, not to eat.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing summary is needed to enable the reader to comprehend\r\nthe relationship of Faraday to this body. His father and grandfather\r\nhad belonged to this sect. In 1763 there was a congregation at Kirkby\r\nStephen (the home of Faraday’s mother) numbering about thirty persons;\r\nand there appears to have been a chapel--now used as a barn--in\r\nClapham. A strong religious feeling had been dominant in the Faraday\r\nfamily through the preceding generation. James Faraday, on his removal\r\nto London, there joined the Sandemanian congregation, which at that\r\ntime met in a small chapel in St. Paul’s Alley, Barbican, since pulled\r\ndown. It had, when founded in 1762, held its first meetings in the hall\r\nof the Glovers’ Company, and later in Bull and Mouth Street, till 1778.\r\nJames Faraday’s wife, mother of Michael Faraday, never formally joined\r\nthe Sandemanian Church, though a regular attendant of the congregation.\r\nMichael Faraday was from a boy brought up in the practice of attending\r\nthis simple worship, and in the atmosphere of this primitive religious\r\nfaith. Doubtless such surroundings exercised a moulding influence on\r\nhis mind and character. The attitude of abstinence from attempts to\r\nproselytise, on the part of the church, finds its reflex in Faraday’s\r\nhabitual reticence, towards all save only the most intimate of friends,\r\non matters of religious faith. “Never once,” says Professor Tyndall,\r\n“during an intimacy of fifteen years, did he mention religion to me,\r\nsave when I drew him on to the subject. He then spoke to me without\r\nhesitation or reluctance; not with any apparent desire to ‘improve the\r\noccasion,’ but to give me such information as I sought. He believed the\r\nhuman heart to be swayed by a power to which science or logic opened no\r\napproach; and right or wrong, this faith, held in perfect tolerance of\r\nthe faiths of others, strengthened and beautified his life.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIS PROFESSION OF FAITH.]\r\n\r\nOf his spiritual history down to the time of his marriage very little\r\nis known, for he made no earlier profession of faith. It is not to\r\nbe supposed that he who was so scrupulous of truth, so single-minded\r\nin every relation of life, would accept the religious belief of his\r\nfathers without satisfying his conscience as to the rightness of its\r\nclaims. Yet none of his letters or writings of that period show any\r\ntrace[60] of that stress of soul through which at one time or another\r\nevery sincere and earnest seeker after truth must pass before he\r\nfinds anchorage. Certain it is that he clung with warm attachment to\r\nthe little self-contained sect amongst whom he had been brought up.\r\nIts influence, though contracting his activities by precluding all\r\nChristian communion or effort outside their circle, and cutting him\r\noff from so much that other Christian bodies hold good, fenced him\r\neffectually from dreams of worldliness, and furnished him with that\r\nvery detachment which was most essential to his scientific pursuits.\r\nOne month after his marriage he made his confession of sin and\r\nprofession of faith before the Sandemanian Church. It was an act of\r\nhumility the more striking in that it was done without any consultation\r\nwith his wife, to whom he was so closely attached, and who was already\r\na member of the congregation. When she asked him why he had not told\r\nher what he was about to do, he replied: “That is between me and my\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\nIn 1844 he wrote to Lady Lovelace as follows:--\r\n\r\n“You speak of religion, and here you will be sadly disappointed in\r\nme. You will perhaps remember that I guessed, and not very far aside,\r\nyour tendency in this respect. Your confidence in me claims in return\r\nmine to you, which indeed I have no hesitation in giving on fitting\r\noccasions, but these I think are very few, for in my mind religious\r\nconversation is generally in vain. _There is no philosophy in my\r\nreligion._ I am of a very small and despised sect of Christians, known,\r\nif known at all, as Sandemanians, and our hope is founded on the faith\r\nthat is in Christ. But though the natural works of God can never by\r\nany possibility come in contradiction with the higher things that\r\nbelong to our future existence, and must with everything concerning\r\nHim ever glorify Him, still I do not think it at all necessary to tie\r\nthe study of the natural sciences and religion together, and, in my\r\nintercourse with my fellow creatures, that which is religious and that\r\nwhich is philosophical have ever been two distinct things.”\r\n\r\nHis own views were stated by himself at the commencement of a lecture\r\non _Mental Education_ in 1854:--\r\n\r\n    High as man is placed above the creatures around him, there\r\n    is a higher and far more exalted position within his view;\r\n    and the ways are infinite in which he occupies his thoughts\r\n    about the fears, or hopes, or expectations of a future life.\r\n    I believe that the truth of that future cannot be brought to\r\n    his knowledge by any exertion of his mental powers, however\r\n    exalted they may be; that it is made known to him by other\r\n    teaching than his own, and is received through simple belief\r\n    of the testimony given. Let no one suppose for a moment that\r\n    the self-education I am about to commend, in respect of the\r\n    things of this life, extends to any considerations of the hope\r\n    set before us, as if man by reasoning could find out God. It\r\n    would be improper here to enter upon this subject further than\r\n    to claim an absolute distinction between religious and ordinary\r\n    belief. I shall be reproached with the weakness of refusing to\r\n    apply those mental operations which I think good in respect\r\n    of high things to the very highest. I am content to bear the\r\n    reproach.\r\n\r\nOne of his friends wrote: “When he entered the meeting-house he left\r\nhis science behind, and he would listen to the prayer and exhortation\r\nof the most illiterate brother of his sect with an attention which\r\nshowed how he loved the word of truth, from whomsoever it came.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AS ELDER AND PREACHER.]\r\n\r\n“The most remarkable event,” says Dr. Bence Jones, “of his life in 1840\r\nwas his election as an elder of the Sandemanian Church. During that\r\nperiod when in London he preached on alternate Sundays.” This was not\r\nan entirely new duty, for he had been occasionally called upon by the\r\nelders, from the date of his admission in 1821, to exhort the brethren\r\nat the week-day evening meetings, or to read the Scriptures in the\r\ncongregation. Bence Jones says that, though no one could lecture like\r\nFaraday, many might preach with more effect. The eager and vivacious\r\nmanner of the lecture-room was exchanged for a devout earnestness\r\nthat was in complete contrast. His addresses have been described as a\r\npatchwork of texts cited rapidly from the Old and New Testaments; and\r\nthey were always extempore, though he prepared careful notes on a piece\r\nof card beforehand. Of these, samples are given in Bence Jones’s “Life\r\nand Letters.” His first discourse as an elder was on Matt. xi. 28–30,\r\ndilating on Christ’s character and example. “Learn of Me.” The ground\r\nof humility of Christians must be the infinite distance between them\r\nand their Pattern. He quoted 1 John ii. 6; 1 Peter ii. 21; Phil. iii.\r\n17; 1 Cor. xi. 1; and 1 Cor. xiv. 1.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly vivid view of Faraday as elder of the Church was given\r\nin 1886[61] by the late Mr. C. C. Walker, himself at one time a member\r\nof the Sandemanian congregation in London; a congregation, moreover,\r\nwhich included several persons of distinction--Cornelius Varley, the\r\nengraver, and George Barnard, the water-colour painter.\r\n\r\n    At Faraday’s chapel there was a presiding elder, supported by\r\n    the rest of the elders on two rows of seats elevated across\r\n    the end of the chapel, one row above the other. The ground\r\n    floor was filled with the old-fashioned high pews, and there\r\n    was a gallery above on both sides, also with pews. Faraday sat\r\n    in a pew on the ground floor, about the middle. There was a\r\n    large table on the floor of the chapel in front of the elders’\r\n    seats. The presiding elder usually preached. Such was the place\r\n    Faraday worshipped in, situated at the end of a narrow dirty\r\n    court, surrounded by squalid houses of the poorest of the poor,\r\n    and so little known that although I knew every street, lane\r\n    and alley of the whole district, and this alley itself, at the\r\n    bottom of which the chapel was, I never knew of the existence\r\n    of the meeting-house till I learned about thirty-five years\r\n    ago that there was a chapel there to which the world-renowned\r\n    Faraday not only went, but where he preached. This led me to\r\n    make a search, and to my great delight, I found it, though with\r\n    some difficulty. Although the neighbourhood was uncleanly, not\r\n    so was the interior of the chapel, nor the dining room, with\r\n    its tables and forms, all of which were spotless.\r\n\r\n    Faraday’s father was a blacksmith, and worshipped here. He\r\n    brought up his family religiously, and Faraday from his\r\n    earliest days attended the chapel. Here he met Miss Barnard,\r\n    his future wife. Mr. Barnard was a respectable “working\r\n    silversmith,” as manufacturing silversmiths were then called,\r\n    to distinguish them from the shopkeepers who then, as now,\r\n    called themselves “silversmiths,” though frequently making none\r\n    of the goods they sell. His manufactory was for a time at Amen\r\n    Court, Paternoster Row; afterwards it was removed to a large\r\n    building erected by the firm at Angel Street, near the General\r\n    Post Office, and the business has since been carried on by the\r\n    sons and grandsons.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: RELIGIOUS SERVICE.]\r\n\r\n    Mr. Barnard and his family worshipped at the Sandemanian\r\n    Chapel. To this chapel Faraday walked every Sunday morning from\r\n    his earliest days; he never kept a carriage, and on religious\r\n    principles would not hire a cab or omnibus on the Lord’s\r\n    day.[62]\r\n\r\n    The service commenced at eleven in the morning and lasted till\r\n    about one, after which the members--“brothers and sisters,”\r\n    as they called each other--had their midday meal “in common”\r\n    in the room attached to the chapel, which has already been\r\n    referred to. The afternoon worship usually ended about five\r\n    o’clock, after partaking of the Lord’s Supper. The services\r\n    were very much like those of the Congregationalists, and\r\n    consisted of extempore prayers, hymns, reading the Scripture,\r\n    and a sermon, usually by the presiding elder. Faraday had been\r\n    an elder for a great many years, and for a considerable time\r\n    was the presiding elder, and consequently preached; but during\r\n    this time relinquished his office. There was one peculiarity\r\n    in the service; the Scriptures were not read by the presiding\r\n    elder, but he called on one of the members to read; and when\r\n    Faraday was there--which he always was when in London--the\r\n    presiding elder named “Brother Michael Faraday,” who then\r\n    left his pew, passing along the aisle, out of the chapel, up\r\n    the stairs at the back, and reappeared behind the presiding\r\n    elder’s seat, who had already opened the large Bible in front\r\n    of him, and pointed out the chapter to be read. It was one of\r\n    the richest treats that it has been my good fortune to enjoy to\r\n    hear Faraday read the Bible. The reader was quite unaware what\r\n    he was to read until it was selected and when one chapter of\r\n    the Old Testament was finished another would be given, probably\r\n    from the New Testament. Usually three chapters were read, and\r\n    sometimes four, in succession; but if it had been half a dozen\r\n    there would have been no weariness, for the perfection of the\r\n    reading, with its clearness of pronunciation, its judicious\r\n    emphasis, the rich musical voice, and the perfect charm of\r\n    the reader, with his natural reverence, made it a delight to\r\n    listen. I have heard most of those who are considered our best\r\n    readers in church and chapel, but have never heard a reader\r\n    that I considered equal to Faraday.\r\n\r\n    At this distance of time his tones are always in my ears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I was told by members of the chapel that he was most assiduous\r\n    in visiting the poorer brethren and sisters at their own homes,\r\n    comforting them in their sorrows and afflictions, and assisting\r\n    them from his own purse. Indeed, they said, he was continually\r\n    pressed to be the guest of the high and noble (which we may\r\n    well believe), but he would, if possible, decline, preferring\r\n    to visit some poor sister in trouble, assist her, take a cup\r\n    of tea with her, read the Bible and pray. Though so full of\r\n    religion, he was never obtrusive with it; it was too sacred a\r\n    thing.\r\n\r\nTyndall has preserved another vivid reminiscence of Faraday’s inner\r\nlife, which he wrote down after one of the earliest dinners which he\r\nhad in the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n“At two o’clock he came down for me. He, his niece, and myself formed\r\nthe party. ‘I never give dinners,’ he said; ‘I don’t know how to give\r\ndinners; and I never dine out. But I should not like my friends to\r\nattribute this to a wrong cause. I act thus for the sake of securing\r\ntime for work, and not through religious motives as some imagine.’ He\r\nsaid grace. I am almost ashamed to call his prayer a ‘saying’ of grace.\r\nIn the language of Scripture, it might be described as the petition\r\nof a son into whose heart God had sent the Spirit of His Son, and who\r\nwith absolute trust asked a blessing from his Father. We dined on\r\nroast beef, Yorkshire pudding, and potatoes, drank sherry, talked of\r\nresearch and its requirements, and of his habit of keeping himself free\r\nfrom the distractions of society. He was bright and joyful--boylike,\r\nin fact, though he is now sixty-two. His work excites admiration, but\r\ncontact with him warms and elevates the heart. Here, surely, is a\r\nstrong man. I love strength, but let me not forget the example of its\r\nunion with modesty, tenderness, and sweetness, in the character of\r\nFaraday.”\r\n\r\nThere is a story told by the Abbé Moigno that one day at Faraday’s\r\nrequest he introduced him to Cardinal Wiseman. In the frank interview\r\nwhich followed, the Cardinal did not hesitate to ask Faraday whether,\r\nin his deepest conviction, he believed all the Church of Christ, holy,\r\ncatholic, and apostolic, was shut up in the little sect in which he was\r\nofficially an elder. “Oh, no!” was Faraday’s reply; “but I do believe\r\nfrom the bottom of my soul that Christ is with us.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ELDERSHIP INTERRUPTED.]\r\n\r\nThe course of Faraday’s eldership was, however, interrupted. It was\r\nexpected of an elder that he should attend every Sunday. One Sunday\r\nhe was absent. When it was discovered that his absence was due to his\r\nhaving been “commanded” to dine with the Queen at Windsor, and that so\r\nfar from expressing penitence, he was prepared to defend his action,\r\nhis office became vacant. He was even cut off from ordinary membership.\r\nNevertheless, he continued for years to attend the meetings just as\r\nbefore. He would even return from the provincial meetings of the\r\nBritish Association to London for the Sunday, so as not to be absent.\r\nIn 1860 he was received back as an elder, which office he held again\r\nfor about three years and a half, and finally resigned it in 1864.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether Faraday ever attempted to form any connected\r\nideas as to the nature or method of operation of the Divine government\r\nof the physical world, in which he had such a whole-souled belief.\r\nNewton has left us such an attempt. Kant in his own way has put forward\r\nanother. So did Herschel; and so in our time have the authors of “The\r\nUnseen Universe.” To Faraday all such “natural theology” would have\r\nseemed vain and aimless. It was no part of the lecturer on natural\r\nphilosophy to speculate as to final causes behind the physical laws\r\nwith which he dealt. Nor, on the other hand, was it the slightest use\r\nto the Christian to inquire in what way God ruled the universe: it was\r\nenough that He did rule it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RELIGION AND SCIENCE.]\r\n\r\nFaraday’s mental organisation, which made it possible for him to\r\nerect an absolute barrier between his science and his religion,\r\nwas an unusual one. The human mind is seldom built in such rigid\r\ncompartments that a man whose whole life is spent in analysing,\r\ntesting, and weighing truths in one department of knowledge, can cut\r\nhimself off from applying the same testing and inquiring processes\r\nin another department. The founder of the sect had taught them that\r\nthe Bible alone, with nothing added to it or taken away from it by\r\nman, was the only and sufficient guide for the soul. Apparently\r\nFaraday never admitted the possibility of human flaw in the printing,\r\nediting, translation, collation, or construction of the Bible. He\r\napparently never even desired to know how it compared with the oldest\r\nmanuscripts, or what was the evidence for the authenticity of the\r\nvarious versions. Having once accepted the views of his sect as to the\r\nabsolute inspiration of the English Bible as a whole, he permitted no\r\nsubsequent question to be raised as to its literal authority. Tyndall\r\nonce described this attitude of mind in his own trenchant way by saying\r\nthat when Faraday opened the door of his oratory he closed that of his\r\nlaboratory. The saying may seem hard, but it is essentially true. To\r\nfew indeed is such a limitation of character possible: possibly it may\r\nbe unique. We may reverence the frank single-minded simplicity of soul\r\nwhich dwelt in Faraday, and may yet hold that, whatever limitation\r\nwas right for him, others would do wrong if they refused to bring\r\nthe powers of the mind--God-given as they believe--to bear upon the\r\ndiscovery of truth in the region of Biblical research. Yet may none of\r\nthem dream of surpassing in transparent honesty of soul, in genuine\r\nChristian humility, in the virtues of kindness, earnestness, and\r\nsympathetic devotion, the great and good man who denied himself that\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Faraday’s usual place of work at bookbinding was a little room on\r\nthe left of the entrance. (_See_ the story of his visit there with\r\nTyndall in after years, as narrated in Tyndall’s “Faraday,” p. 8.)\r\n\r\n[2] Still preserved in Faraday’s Diploma-book, now in the possession of\r\nthe Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[3] An account of this machine will be found in the _Argonaut_, vol.\r\nii., p. 33.\r\n\r\n[4] “When he [Faraday] was young, poor, and altogether unknown,\r\nMasquerier was kind to him; and now that he is a great man he does not\r\nforget his old friend.”--Diary of H.

Where any instruments or apparatus may be required, to attend\r\nto their careful removal from the model-room and laboratory to the\r\nlecture-room, and to clean and replace them after being used, reporting\r\nto the managers such accidents as shall require repair, a constant\r\ndiary being kept by him for that purpose. That in one day in each week\r\nhe be employed in keeping clean the models in the repository, and that\r\nall the instruments in the glass cases be cleaned and dusted at least\r\nonce within a month.”\r\n\r\n[8] The City Philosophical Society was given up at the time when\r\nMechanics’ Institutes were started in London, Tatum selling his\r\napparatus to that established in Fleet Street, the forerunner of the\r\nBirkbeck Institution. Many of the City Society’s members joined the\r\nSociety of Arts.\r\n\r\n[9] Two passages may be quoted. “Finally, Sir H. has no valet except\r\nmyself ... and ’tis the name more than the thing which hurts.” “When I\r\nreturn home, I fancy I shall return to my old profession of bookseller,\r\nfor books still continue to please me more than anything else.”\r\n\r\n[10] The meeting at which it was actually originated was held under the\r\npresidency of Sir Joseph Banks, P.R.S., nominally as a meeting for the\r\n_Assistance of the Poor!_\r\n\r\n[11] A writer in the _Quarterly Journal of Science_ for 1868, p. 50,\r\nsays: “We have reason to know that Davy was slightly annoyed that the\r\ncertificate proposing Faraday for election should have originated with\r\nRichard Phillips, and that he should not have been consulted before\r\nthat gentleman was allowed to take the matter in hand.” This is absurd,\r\nbecause the President was by long-standing etiquette debarred from\r\nsigning the certificates of any but foreign members, as the certificate\r\nbook of the Royal Society attests.\r\n\r\n[12] See p. 12.\r\n\r\n[13] Liddon’s “Life of E. B. Pusey” (1893), p. 219.\r\n\r\n[14] For this information and many particulars of this transaction I am\r\nindebted to Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n[15] “It was probably in a four-wheeled velocipede that Faraday was\r\naccustomed, some thirty years ago, to work his way up and down the\r\nsteep roads near Hampstead and Highgate. This machine appears to have\r\nbeen of his own construction, and was worked by levers and a crank\r\naxle in the same manner as the rest of the four-wheeled class.”--_The\r\nVelocipede: its past, its present, and its future._ By J.

C. OERSTED, _Ann. of\r\nPhil._, Oct., 1820, pp. 273–276.\r\n\r\n[19] This is an error due to haste in writing.\r\n\r\n[20] See a paper by the author in the _Philosophical Magazine_ for\r\nJune, 1895, entitled “Note on a Neglected Experiment of Ampère.”\r\n\r\n[21] Compare Dumas, “Éloge Historique de Michel Faraday,” p. xxxiii.,\r\nwho gives the above statement.

The ring itself is still preserved at the Royal\r\nInstitution amongst the Faraday relics. The accompanying cut (Fig. 4)\r\nis facsimiled from Faraday’s own sketch in his laboratory note-book.\r\n\r\n[23] Now in the possession of the author, to whom it was given by his\r\nkinswoman Lady Wilson, youngest daughter of Richard Phillips.\r\n\r\n[24] The day of the Annual Meeting and election of Council of the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n[25] This is a slip in the description; the momentary current induced\r\nin the secondary wire on making the current in the primary is\r\n_inverse_: it is succeeded by a momentary _direct_ current when the\r\nprimary current is stopped.\r\n\r\n[26] This doubtless refers to Whewell, of Cambridge, whom he was in the\r\nhabit of consulting on questions of nomenclature.\r\n\r\n[27] A man of fashion who had, without any claim to distinction, wormed\r\nhimself into scientific society, posed as a savant, and had delivered a\r\nhigh-flown oration on botany at the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\n[28] The use of this term, as distinguished from production, to\r\ndistinguish between the primary generation of a current in a voltaic\r\ncell, a thermopile, or a friction-machine, by chemical or molecular\r\naction, and its indirect production without contact or communication of\r\nany material sort, as by motion of a wire near a magnet or by secondary\r\ninfluence from a neighbouring primary current while that current is\r\nvarying in strength or proximity, is exceedingly significant. Faraday’s\r\nown meaning in adopting it is best grasped by referring to p. 1 of the\r\n“Experimental Researches”:--\r\n\r\n    “On the _Induction_ of Electric Currents.”... The general\r\n    term _induction_ which, as it has been received into\r\n    scientific language, may also, with propriety, be used to\r\n    express the power which electrical currents may possess of\r\n    inducing any particular state upon matter in their immediate\r\n    neighbourhood.... I propose to call this action of the current\r\n    from the voltaic battery _volta-electric induction_ ... but as\r\n    a distinction in language is still necessary, I propose to call\r\n    the agency thus exerted by ordinary magnets _magneto-electric\r\n    or magne-electric_ induction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[29] “Experimental Researches,” i. 25, art. 85. This copper disc is\r\nstill preserved at the Royal Institution. It was shown in action by the\r\nauthor of this work, at a lecture at the Royal Institution delivered\r\nApril 11th, 1891.

The statement is strictly true if the galvanometer\r\n(as was the case with Faraday’s) is one of relatively long period of\r\noscillation.\r\n\r\n[42] From ἄνω _upwards_ and ὁδός _a way_; and κατά _downwards_ and ὁδός\r\n_a way_. The words _cathode_ and _cation_ are now more usually spelled\r\n_kathode_ and _kation_. Faraday sometimes spelled the word _cathion_\r\n(Exp. Res. Art. 1351), as did also Whewell (Hist. of Ind. Sciences,\r\nvol. iii. p. 166).\r\n\r\n[43] Literally, _the travellers_, the things which are going.\r\n\r\n[44] The term _induction_ appears to have been originally used, in\r\ncontradistinction to _contact_ or _conduction_, to connote those\r\neffects which apparently are in the class of actions at a distance.\r\nThus we may have induction of a charge by a charge, or of a magnet-pole\r\nby a magnet-pole. To these Faraday had added the induction of a current\r\nby a current, and the induction of a current by a moving magnet. Amid\r\nsuch varying adaptations of the word _induction_, there is much gain\r\nin allotting to the electrostatic induction of charges by charges the\r\ndistinguishing name of _influence_, as suggested by Priestley.\r\n\r\n[45] “Faraday as a Discoverer,” p. 67.\r\n\r\n[46] Newton’s third letter to Bentley.\r\n\r\n[47] Faraday’s definition is:--“By a _diamagnetic_, I mean a body\r\nthrough which lines of magnetic force are passing, and which does not\r\nby their action assume the usual magnetic state of iron or loadstone.”\r\nIt was thus a term strictly analogous to the term _dielectric_ used for\r\nbodies through which lines of electric force might pass.\r\n\r\n[48] _i.e._ Specimen No. 174. Its composition was equal parts by weight\r\nof boracic acid, oxide of lead, and silica.\r\n\r\n[49] Subsequent investigation has reduced this figure to about 186,400\r\nmiles per second, or about 30,000,000,000 centimetres per second.\r\n\r\n[50] The accompanying diagram (Fig. 20) was not given by Faraday. It\r\nwas pencilled by the author more than twenty years ago in the margin\r\nof his copy of Faraday’s “Experimental Researches,” vol. iii., p. 450,\r\nopposite this passage.\r\n\r\n[51] The discourse was to have been delivered by Wheatstone himself,\r\nwho, however, at the last moment, overcome by the shyness from which he\r\nsuffered to an almost morbid degree, quitted the Institution, and left\r\nthe delivery of the discourse to Faraday.\r\n\r\n[52] The italics here are mine. S. P. T.\r\n\r\n[53] It is right to add that what, according to the theory explained in\r\nthe text, must be the correct explanation of the peculiar phenomena of\r\nmagnetic induction depending on magnecrystallic properties was clearly\r\nstated in the form of a conjecture by Faraday in his twenty-second\r\nseries in the following terms: “Or we might suppose that the crystal\r\nis a little more apt for magnetic induction, or a little less apt\r\nfor diamagnetic induction, in the direction of the magnecrystallic\r\naxis than in other directions” (Sir William Thomson, _Philosophical\r\nMagazine_, 1851, or “Papers on Electrostatics and Magnetism,” p. 476).\r\n\r\n[54] This is exactly Stokes’s theorem of “tubes” of force.

The\r\nfollowing excerpts from the journals of Walter White show the cause:--\r\n\r\n“November 25th.--There have been many secret conferences this\r\nweek--much trimming and time-serving. Alas for human nature!”\r\n\r\n“November 30th.--The eventful day, the ballot begun. Mr. Faraday made\r\nsome remarks about the list.”\r\n\r\n[57] He was a Chevalier of the Prussian Order of Merit, also Commander\r\nin the Legion of Honour, and Knight Commander of the Order of St.\r\nMaurice and St. Lazarus.\r\n\r\n[58] Faraday’s nephew, Frank Barnard, stated in 1871 that the London\r\ncongregation included amongst its members not more than twenty men,\r\nmostly quite poor, only seven or eight of them being masters of their\r\nown businesses, and that Faraday was for some time the wealthiest man\r\nof the fraternity.\r\n\r\n[59] C. M. Davies: “Unorthodox London,” page 284.\r\n\r\n[60] A letter from his nephew, Frank Barnard, to Dr. Gladstone says:\r\n“I believe that in his younger days he had his period of hesitation,\r\nof questioning in that great argument. I have heard that, so alive was\r\nhe to the necessity of investigating anything that seemed important,\r\nhe visited Joanna Southcote, perhaps to learn what that woman’s\r\npretensions were: I think he was a mere lad at that time. But this\r\nperiod once passed, he questioned no more, for the more he saw that\r\nNature was mighty, the more he felt that God was mightier; and to any\r\ncavillings upon the doubts of Colenso or the reality of the Mosaic\r\ncosmogony, I believe he would simply have replied in the apostle’s\r\nwords: ‘Is anything too hard for God?’...\r\n\r\n“I once heard him say from the pulpit, ‘I hope none of my hearers will\r\nin these matters listen to the thing called philosophy.’”\r\n\r\n[61] _Manchester Guardian_, November 27.\r\n\r\n[62] [This is not altogether accurate.

The original book inconsistently followed “electro”\r\nwith a hyphen, and that has not been changed here.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced quotation\r\nmarks were remedied when the change was obvious, and otherwise left\r\nunbalanced.\r\n\r\nIllustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs\r\nand outside quotations. In versions of this eBook that support\r\nhyperlinks, the page references in the List of Illustrations lead to\r\nthe corresponding illustrations.\r\n\r\nRunning page headers in the original book are shown here as sidenotes,\r\nplaced between paragraphs and near the topics to which they refer.\r\n\r\nFootnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been renumbered\r\ninto a single sequence, collected, and moved to just above the Index.\r\n\r\nThe index was reformatted slightly and was not checked systematically\r\nfor proper alphabetization or correct page references.",
