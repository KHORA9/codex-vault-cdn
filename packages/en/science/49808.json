F. C. FULLER, D.S.O.\r\n  (Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry)\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK\r\n  E. P. DUTTON AND COMPANY\r\n  1920\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DEDICATIONS_\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n_I dedicate this book to the modern military scientists, that small\r\ncompany of gentlemen who, imbued with a great idea, were willing to set\r\nall personal interest aside in order to design a machine destined to\r\nrevolutionise the science of war._\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_I dedicate this book to the modern armourers of the British factories,\r\nthose men and women whose untiring patriotism and indomitable endurance\r\nin the workshops produced a weapon whereby the lives of many of their\r\ncomrades were saved._\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n_I dedicate this book to the modern knights in armour, the fighting\r\ncrews of the Tank Corps; those Officers, Non-commissioned Officers and\r\nMen, who, through their own high courage and noble determination on the\r\nbattlefield, maintained Liberty and accomplished Victory._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following work is the story of a great and unique adventure as\r\nheroic as the exploits of the Argonauts of old, and, though the time\r\nperhaps has not yet arrived wherein to judge the part played by tanks\r\nin the Great War, I feel that, whatever may be the insight and judgment\r\nof the eventual historian of the British Tank Corps, he will probably\r\nlack that essential ingredient of all true history--the witnessing of\r\nthe events concerning which he relates.\r\n\r\nI, the writer of this book, first set eyes on a tank towards the end of\r\nAugust 1916. At this time I little thought that I should eventually be\r\nhonoured by becoming the Chief General Staff Officer of the Tank Corps,\r\nfor a period extending from December 1916 to August 1918. The time\r\nspent during this long connection with the greatest military invention\r\nof the Great War, it is hoped, has not been altogether wasted, and the\r\nstory here set forth represents my appreciation of having been selected\r\nto fill so intensely interesting an appointment.\r\n\r\nBesides having witnessed and partaken in many of the events related,\r\nthose who have assisted me in this book have all been either closely\r\nconnected with the Tank Corps or in the Corps itself, they one and\r\nall were partakers in either the creation of the Corps or in the many\r\nactions in which it fought.\r\n\r\nSo much assistance have I received that I can at most but consider\r\nmyself as editor to a mass of information provided for me by others.\r\nThose I more especially wish to thank amongst this goodly company are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nCaptain the Hon. Evan Charteris, G.S.O.3, Tank Corps, for the accurate\r\nand careful records of the Corps which he compiled from the earliest\r\ndays of the tank movement in 1914, to the close of the battle of\r\nCambrai. Many of these were written under, shall I say, far from\r\nluxurious circumstances, for Captain Charteris, I feel, must have often\r\nfound himself, in his shell-blasted estaminet, less well cared for than\r\nthe rats of Albert and as much out of place as Alcibiades in a Peckham\r\nparlour.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Charteris forsook the “cabaret sans nom,” for some\r\nill-disposed shell had removed half the signboard, Captain O. A.\r\nArchdale, A.D.C. to General Elles, took up the difficult task and, from\r\nMarch 1918 onwards, kept the Tank Corps Diary upon which Chapters XXIX,\r\nXXXIII, XXXV, and XXXVII are founded.\r\n\r\nTaking now the chapters seriatim, I have to thank Major G. W. G. Allen,\r\nM.C., G.S.O.2, War Office,[1] for parts of Chapter I, and also the\r\neditors of _The American Machinist_ and _The Engineer_ for allowing\r\nme to quote respectively from the following admirable articles: “The\r\nForerunner of the Tank,” by H. H. Manchester, and “The Evolution of\r\nthe Chain Track Tractor”; Sir Eustace Tennyson D’Eyncourt, K.C.B.,\r\nDirector of Naval Construction, the Admiralty, and Major-General E. D.\r\nSwinton, C.B., D.S.O., both pioneers of the tanks, and indefatigable\r\nworkers in the cause, for much of the information in Chapters II\r\nand IV; Major H. S. Sayer, G.S.0.2, War Office,[2] for Chapter III;\r\nMajor O. A. Forsyth-Major, Second in Command of the Palestine Tank\r\nDetachment, for the reports relative to the second and third battles\r\nof Gaza, upon which Chapters XI and XVII are based; Major S. H. Foot,\r\nD.S.O., G.S.O.2, War Office,[3] my close friend and fearless assistant,\r\nfor suggestions generally, and particularly in Chapter XVI. My thanks\r\nare also due to some unknown but far-sighted benefactor of the Tank\r\nCorps for Chapter XX; to Lieutenant-Colonel D. W. Bradley, D.S.O., and\r\nBrigadier-General E. B. Mathew-Lannowe, C.M.G., D.S.O., G.O.C. Tank\r\nCorps Training Centre, Wool, for information regarding the Depot in\r\nChapter XXI; to the relentlessly inventive Lieutenant-Colonel L. C. A.\r\nde B. Doucet, O.C. Tank Carrier Units, and so commander of the first\r\nsupply fleet which ever “set sail” on land, for information to be\r\nfound in Chapter XXII; to Lieutenant-Colonel J. D. M. Molesworth,\r\nM.C., A.D.A.S., Tank Corps, who in spite of the scholastics gave the\r\nlie to the tag _Ex nihilo nihil fit_, for parts of Chapter XXIV; to\r\nMajor R. Spencer, M.C., Liaison Officer, Tank Corps, whose unfailing\r\ncharm and insight always succeeded in extracting from our brave Allies\r\nnot only the glamour of great adventures but the detail of truthful\r\noccurrences, for the events described in Chapters XXV and XXXVI;\r\nto Major F. E. Hotblack, D.S.O., M.C., G.S.O.2, War Office,[4] my\r\nfriend and companion, who unfailingly would guide _any one_ over wire\r\nand shell-hole immune and unscathed, for Chapters XXVIII, XXXI, and\r\nXXXIV; to Lieutenant C. B. Arnold, D.S.O., Commander of Whippet Tank\r\n“Musical Box,” for the simple and heroic exploit related in Chapter\r\nXXX; to Major T. L. Leigh Mallory, D.S.O., O.C. 8th Squadron, R.A.F.,\r\nwhose energy resulted not only in the cementing of a close comradeship\r\nbetween the two supreme mechanical weapons of the age but of a close\r\nco-operation which saved many lives in battle, for much of Chapter\r\nXXXII; to Lieutenant-Colonel E. J. Carter, O.C. 17th Tank Armoured Car\r\nBattalion, who was as great a terror to the German Corps Commanders as\r\nPaul Jones was to the Manchester merchantmen and who had the supreme\r\nhonour to break over the Rhine the first British flag--the colours of\r\nthe Tank Corps--for Chapter XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nIt was a great brotherhood, the Tank Corps, and if there were “duds” in\r\nit there certainly were not old ones, for the Commander of the Corps,\r\nMajor-General H. J. Elles, C.B., D.S.O., was under forty, and most of\r\nhis staff and subordinate commanders were younger than himself. Youth\r\nis apt, rightly, to be enthusiastic, and General Elles must frequently\r\nhave had a trying time in regulating this enthusiasm, canalising it\r\nforward against the enemy and backward diplomatically towards our\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWe of the Tank Corps Headquarters Staff knew what we wanted. Realising\r\nthe power of the machine which the brains of England had created, we\r\nnever hesitated over a “No” when we knew that hundreds if not thousands\r\nof lives depended on a “Yes.”\r\n\r\nModestly, looking back on the war from a comfortable armchair in\r\nLondon, I see clearly, quite clearly, that we were right. The war\r\nhas proved it, and our endeavours were not in vain. We were right,\r\nand youth generally is right, for it possesses mental elasticity,\r\nits brains are plastic and not polarised. The mental athlete is the\r\nyoung man: the Great War, like all other wars, has proved this again\r\nand again. We have heard much of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, but they\r\nscoffed at the tank just as Wurmser and Alvinzi scoffed at the ragged\r\nvoltigeurs of the Army of Italy with which the Little Corporal was,\r\nin 1796, about to astonish Europe. We have also astonished Europe, we\r\nwho wandered over the Somme battlefield with dimmed eyes, and over the\r\nFlanders swamps with a lump in our throats.\r\n\r\nThere was Colonel F. Searle, C.B.E., D.S.O., Chief Engineer of the\r\nCorps, a true civilian with a well-cut khaki jacket and lion-tamer’s\r\nboots. He could not understand the military ritual, and we soldiers\r\nseemed never to be able to explain it to him. Throughout the war, in\r\nspite of his immense mechanical labours, I verily believe he had only\r\none wish, and this was to erect a guillotine outside a certain holy\r\nplace. There was Major G. A. Green, M.C., Colonel Searle’s deputy,\r\nthe father of terrible propositions, the visitor of battlefields,\r\nthe searcher after shell-holes, the breather of profane words. The\r\nCorps owed a lot to Green; a firm believer in seeing things before\r\ncriticising them, he was a very great asset.\r\n\r\nThe “King of Grocers,” this was Colonel T.J. Uzielli, D.S.O., M.C.,\r\nD.A. and Q.M.G. of the Corps, business-like, and an administrator from\r\nboot to crown. Suave yet fearless, tactful yet truthful, the Corps owed\r\nmuch to his ability. It was never left in want, his decision gave it\r\nwhat it asked for, his prevision cut down this asking to a minimum.\r\nAbly seconded by Major H. C. Atkin-Berry, D.S.O., M.C., and Major R. W.\r\nDundas, M.C., the “A” and “Q” branches of the Tank Corps Staff formed\r\nthe foundation of the Corps’ efficiency.\r\n\r\nOn the “G” side there was myself. Under me came Major G. le Q. Martel,\r\nD.S.O., M.C., very much R.E. and still more tanks, the man who\r\n“sloshed” friend or foe. One day, in March 1918, I was at Fricourt,\r\nthen none too healthy. Martel walked down the road: “Where are you\r\ngoing?” I shouted. “To Montauban,” he answered. “I hear it is full of\r\nBoche,” I replied. “Well, I will go and see,” said Martel, and off he\r\nmoved eastwards. There was Major F. E. Hotblack, D.S.O., M.C., lover of\r\nbeauty and battles, a mixture of Abelard and Marshal Ney. Were Ninon\r\nde l’Enclos alive he would have been at her elbow; as she is dust,\r\nhe, instead, collected “troddels”[5] off dead Germans--a somewhat\r\nremarkable character. As G.S.O.2 Training, Major H. Boyd-Rochfort,\r\nD.S.O., M.C., from West Meath, his enthusiasm for tanks nearly wrecked\r\na famous corps; yet Boyd only smiled, and his smile somehow always\r\nreminded one of Peter Kelly’s whisky, there was a handshake or a\r\nfight in it. The two G.S.O.s3 were Captain the Hon. E. Charteris and\r\nCaptain I. M. Stewart, M.C. Charteris was the “_Arbiter Elegantiarum_”\r\nof our Headquarters. He kept the Corps’ records, as already stated,\r\nand without these it would scarcely have been possible to write this\r\nhistory. He was our _maître d’hôtel_; he gave us beach nut bacon and\r\nhoney for breakfast, kept his weather eye open for a one-armed man,\r\nelaborated menus which rivalled those of Trimalchio, and gave sparkle\r\nto us all by the ripple of his wit. Lastly, Ian Stewart of the Argyll\r\nand Sutherland Highlanders. In kilts, no girl between Hekla and Erebus\r\nhas ever been known to resist him; but his efforts, whilst in the Tank\r\nCorps, did not lie in conquering hearts but in perpetually worrying my\r\nunfortunate self to become party to his own suicide--for nothing would\r\nkeep him from the battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe first three brigadiers of the Corps were all remarkable men.\r\nBrigadier-General C. D’A. B. S. Baker-Carr, C.M.G., D.S.O., commanding\r\nthe 1st Tank Brigade, started the war as a gentleman chauffeur, a most\r\ncheery companion, the Murat of the Corps, ever ready for a battle or\r\na game. I remember him at Montenescourt, during the battle of Arras\r\n1917, fighting with the telephone, at Ypres fighting with the mud, at\r\nCambrai fighting with a comfortable, vacant, rotund little man, but\r\never cheerful and prepared to meet you with a smile and a glass of\r\nold brandy. Commanding the 2nd Tank Brigade was Brigadier-General A.\r\nCourage, D.S.O., M.C. He possessed only half a jaw, having lost the\r\nrest at Ypres; yet at conferences he was a host in himself, and what\r\na “pow-wow” must have been like before the Boche bullet hit him is\r\nnot even to be found in the works of the great Munchausen. No detail\r\nescaped his eye, no trouble was too great, and no fatigue sufficient\r\nto suggest a pause. The successes of Hamel and Moreuil in 1918 were\r\ndue to his energy, and on these successes was the battle of Amiens\r\nfounded. The last of the original Brigadiers was Brigadier-General J.\r\nHardress-Lloyd, D.S.O., commanding the 3rd Tank Brigade. He started the\r\nwar as a stowaway. This resulted in no one ever discovering what his\r\nsubstantive rank was; by degrees a myth as to his origin was cultivated\r\nby innumerable “A” clerks both in France and England; these lived\r\nand throve on this mystery, which no doubt will at a distant date be\r\nelucidated by some future Lemprière. Hardress-Lloyd was one of the main\r\ncauses of the battle of Cambrai. He, I believe, introduced the idea to\r\nGeneral Sir Julian Byng, this away back in August 1917. Hardress-Lloyd\r\nwas a man of big ideas and always kept a good table and a fine\r\nstable--in fact, a _beau sabreur_. I will leave Hardress at that.\r\n\r\nAbove are to be sought the real foundations of the Corps’ efficiency\r\nunder its gallant Commander, Major-General H. J. Elles, C.B., D.S.O.,\r\nwho endowed it with that high moral, that fine _esprit de corps_ and\r\njaunty _esprit de cocarde_ which impelled it from one success to\r\nanother. These foundations no future historian is likely to be so\r\nintimately acquainted with as I--and now for the story.[6]\r\n\r\nThe history itself is purposely uncritical, because any criticism which\r\nmight have been included is so similar to that directed against the\r\nintroducers of the locomotive and the motor-car that it would be but a\r\nrepetition, tedious enough to the reader, were it here repeated.\r\n\r\nHuman opinion is conservative by instinct, and what to mankind is most\r\nheterodox is that which is most novel: this is a truism in war as it is\r\nin politics or religion. It took 1000 years for gunpowder to transform\r\nwar. In 1590, a certain Sir John Smythe wrote a learned work: “Certain\r\ndiscourses concerning the forms and effects of divers sorts of weapons,\r\nand other very important matters militarie, greatlie mistaken by divers\r\nof our men of warre in these daies; and chiefly, of the Mosquet,\r\nthe Caliver, and the Long-bow; as also of the great sufficiencie,\r\nexcellencie and wonderful effects of Archers,” in which he extols an\r\nobsolete weapon and decries a more modern one--the arquebus. “For the\r\nreactionaries of his time George Stephenson with his locomotive was the\r\noriginal villan of the piece; he was received with unbridled abuse and\r\npersecution. Most of Stephenson’s time was spent in fighting fools.”[7]\r\nAt the beginning of the present century nearly every English country\r\ngentleman swore that nothing would ever induce him to exchange his\r\ncarriage for a motor-car--yet the locomotive and the motor-car have\r\ntriumphed, and triumphed so completely that all that their inventors\r\nclaimed for them appears to-day as hostile criticism against their\r\naccomplishments.\r\n\r\nSo with the tank, it has come not only to stay but to revolutionise,\r\nand I for one, enthusiastic as I am, do not for a minute doubt that\r\nmy wildest dreams about its future will not only be realised but\r\nsurpassed, and that from its clumsy endeavours in the Great War will\r\narise a completely new direction in the art of warfare itself.\r\n\r\nThat the Tank had, and still has, many doubters, many open critics,\r\nis true enough; but there is no disparagement in this, rather is it a\r\ncompliment, for the masses of mankind are myopic, and had they accepted\r\nit with acclaim how difficult would it have been for it even to come,\r\nlet alone stay and grow.\r\n\r\nThe criticism directed against this greatest military invention of\r\nthe war was the stone upon which its progress was whetted. Without\r\ncriticism we might still have Big Willie, but we enthusiasts determined\r\nthat not only would we break down this criticism by means of the\r\nmachine itself, but that we would render our very machine ridiculous\r\nby machines of a better type, and it is ridicule which kills. So we\r\nproceeded, and as type followed type, victory followed victory. Then\r\nour critics tacked and veered: it was not the tank they objected to but\r\nour opinions regarding it; they were overstatements; why, we should\r\nsoon be claiming for it powers to boil their morning tea and shave them\r\nwhilst still in bed. Why not? If such acts are required, a tank can be\r\nbuilt to accomplish them, because the tank possesses power and energy,\r\nand energy is the motive force of all things.\r\n\r\nIt is just this point that the critics missed; their minds being\r\ncontrolled by the conventions of the day. They could not see that\r\nif the horse-power in a man is _x_, that the circumference of his\r\nactivities is a circle with _x_ as its radius. They could not see that\r\nif the horse-power of a machine is 100_x_; its circumference will\r\nbe vastly greater than that of man’s; neither could they see that\r\nwhilst in man _x_ is constant, provided the man is supplied regularly\r\nwith beef, bread and beer, in a machine _x_ may be increased almost\r\nindefinitely, and that if a circle with _n_ as its circumference will\r\nnot embrace the problem, probably all that is necessary is to add more\r\n_x_’s to its radius. Indeed, the science of mechanics is simplicity\r\nitself when compared with that of psychology, and as in war mechanics\r\ngrow so will psychology, in comparison, dwindle, until perhaps we may\r\nsee in armies as complete a change from hand-weapons to machine-weapons\r\nas we have seen in our workshops from hand-tools to machine-tools, and\r\nthe economy will be as proportionate.\r\n\r\nBefore the Great War I was a believer in conscription and in the Nation\r\nin Arms; I was an 1870 soldier. My sojourn in the Tank Corps has\r\ndissipated these ideas. Today I am a believer in war mechanics, that\r\nis, in a mechanical army which requires few men and powerful machines.\r\nEqually am I a disbeliever in what a venerable acquaintance, old in\r\nideas rather than years, said to me on the afternoon of November 11th,\r\n1918. These are his words, and I repeat them as he exclaimed them:\r\n“Thank God we can now get back to real soldiering!”\r\n\r\n            J. F. C.

As regards these times there\r\nis an authentic record concerning twenty-five knights in armour who\r\nrode out one day and met a great mob of insurgent peasants which they\r\ncharged and routed, killing and wounding no fewer than 1,200 of them,\r\nwithout sustaining a single casualty themselves. To all intents and\r\npurposes, these knights were living tanks--a combination of muscular\r\nenergy, protective armour, and offensive weapons.\r\n\r\nKnights in armour remained practically invulnerable as long as the\r\npropellant for missile weapons was limited to the bow-string and as\r\nlong as the knights fought within the limitations which their armour\r\nimposed upon them. At Crécy and similar battles, the chivalry of France\r\nsuffered defeat more through the condition of ground they attempted\r\nto negotiate, than through the arrows of the English archers. They,\r\nin fact, became “ditched” like a tank in the mud, and being rendered\r\nimmobile, fell an easy prey to the enemy’s men-at-arms. A fact which\r\nproves that it was not the arrow which generally destroyed the knight\r\nis that the archers were equipped with maces or leaden hammers[8] by\r\nmeans of which the knight could, when once bogged or “bellied,” be\r\nstunned, rendered innocuous, his armour opened, and he himself taken\r\nprisoner for ransom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM 1. SCOTTISH WAR CART, 1456.]\r\n\r\nThe true banisher of armour was gunpowder, for when once the thickest\r\narmour, which human energy would permit of being worn, could be\r\npenetrated, it became but an encumbrance to its wearer. Though\r\ngunpowder was introduced as a missile propellant on the battlefield\r\nas early as the twelfth century, it was not until the close of the\r\nfourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth centuries that its influence\r\nbegan to be felt, and it is interesting to note that directly it\r\nbecame apparent that the hand gun would beat armour carried by men,\r\nother means of carrying it were introduced. These means took the form\r\nof battle cars or mobile fortresses.[9] Conrad Kyeser,[10] in his\r\nmilitary manuscript, written between 1395 and 1405, pictures several\r\n“battle cars.” Some of these are equipped with lances, whilst others\r\nare armed with cannon. A few years later, in 1420, Fontana designed\r\na large “battle car,” and the following year Archinger another, to\r\nenclose no fewer than 100 men. All these cars were moved by means of\r\nmuscle power, _i.e._ men or animals harnessed inside them. A picture of\r\none of these is to be found in Francis Grose’s _Military Antiquities_,\r\nvol. I, p. 388 (see Diagram 1). Its crew consisted of eight men, the\r\nsame as the Mark I Tank. The following extract concerning these carts\r\nis of interest:\r\n\r\n  “Another species of artillery were the war carts, each carrying\r\n  two Peteraros or chamber’d pieces; several of these carts are\r\n  represented in the Cowdry picture of the siege of Bullogne, one of\r\n  which is given in this work; these carts seem to have been borrowed\r\n  from the Scotch; Henry, in his History of England, mentions them\r\n  as peculiar to that nation, and quotes the two following acts of\r\n  parliament respecting them; one A.D. 1456 wherein they are thus\r\n  described: ‘it is tocht speidfull that the King mak requiest to\r\n  certain of the great burrows of the land that are of ony myght, to\r\n  mak carts of weir, and in elk cart twa gunnis and ilk one to have\r\n  twa chalmers, with the remnant of the graith that effeirs thereto,\r\n  and an cunnard man to shute thame.’ By another Act, A.D. 1471, the\r\n  prelates and barons are commanded to provide such carts of war\r\n  against their old enemies the English (Black Acts, James II, Act\r\n  52, James III, Act 55).”\r\n\r\nWith all these war carts the limitations imposed upon them by muscular\r\nmotive force must have been considerable on any save perfectly firm and\r\nlevel ground, consequently other means of movement were attempted, and\r\nduring the last quarter of the fifteenth century the battle car enters\r\nits second phase. In a work of Valturio’s dated 1472, a design is to\r\nbe found of one of these vehicles propelled by means of wind wheels\r\n(see Diagram 2). Ten years later we find Leonardo da Vinci engaged in\r\nthe design of another type of self-moving machine. Writing to Ludovico\r\nSforza he says:\r\n\r\n  “I am building secure and covered chariots which are invulnerable,\r\n  and when they advance with their guns into the midst of the foe,\r\n  even the largest enemy masses must retreat; and behind them the\r\n  infantry can follow in safety and without opposition.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM 2. VALTURIO’S WAR CHARIOT, 1472.]\r\n\r\nWhat the motive force of this engine of war was is unknown, but the\r\nabove description is that of the tank of today, in fact so accurate is\r\nthis description that Leonardo da Vinci, nearly 350 years ago, had a\r\nclearer idea of a tank operation than many a British soldier had prior\r\nto the battle of Cambrai, fourteen months after the first tank had\r\ntaken the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM 3. HOLZSCHUHER’S BATTLE CAR, 1558.]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar self-moving wagon was designed for Maximilian I and\r\nin 1558 Holzschuher describes a battle car a picture of which shows it\r\nin action preceded by infantry and flanked by cavalry (see Diagram 3).\r\n\r\nIn 1599 Simon Stevin is supposed to have constructed for the Prince of\r\nOrange two veritable landships; these consisted in small battleships\r\nfully rigged, mounted upon wheels (see Diagram 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM 4. SIMON STEVIN’S LANDSHIP, 1599.]\r\n\r\n  “The earliest English patent for a self-moving wagon which could,\r\n  if desired, be used in war, was probably that taken out by David\r\n  Ramsey in 1634. In 1658 Caspar Schott designed one to inclose 100\r\n  men and to be employed against the Turks.”[11]\r\n\r\nAll the users of these inventions were destined to disappointment,\r\nfor the science of mechanics was not sufficiently advanced to render\r\nself-movement practical and it was not until the middle of the\r\neighteenth century that a fresh attempt was made to reintroduce so\r\nessential a weapon as the war cart. The following account of this\r\nreintroduction is quoted from Mr. Manchester’s most interesting article:\r\n\r\n  “After the practical application of steam by Watt in 1765 we find\r\n  an early attempt to apply it to land transportation in what must be\r\n  considered the first steam automobile. As early as 1769 Cugnot in\r\n  France set a steam boiler upon the frame of a wagon and succeeded\r\n  in making the wagon go. His idea was that this invention could be\r\n  used in war, and on this presumption he was the next year assisted\r\n  by the government to construct an improvement. The speed, however,\r\n  was scarcely more than 2½ miles an hour, and the machine would run\r\n  only twenty minutes before it had to stop for fifteen minutes to\r\n  get up more steam. In his first public trial he had the ill-luck to\r\n  run into and knock down part of a stone wall. This led to his being\r\n  temporarily cast into jail, and his experiments were abandoned.\r\n  Napoleon must have visualised the possibilities of Cugnot’s machine\r\n  for military purposes, for when the great general was selected a\r\n  member of the French Institute, the subject of his paper was ‘The\r\n  Automobile in War.’”\r\n\r\nThe “battle car” had now, at least experimentally, evolved into the\r\nsteam wagon which could run on roads; the next step was to invent one\r\nwhich would move in any direction across country, in other words to\r\nreplace the wheels by tracks. The evolution of the caterpillar tractor\r\nbrings us to the fourth phase in the evolution of the “battle car.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of distributing the weight of a vehicle over a greater area\r\nthan that provided by its own wheels is by no means a novel one; one\r\nyear after Cugnot produced the first steam automobile Richard Lovell\r\nEdgeworth patented a device whereby a portable railway could be\r\nattached to a wheeled carriage; it consisted of several pieces of wood\r\nwhich moved in regular succession in such a manner that a sufficient\r\nlength of railing was constantly at rest for the wheels to roll upon.\r\nThe principle of this device was but a modification of that upon which\r\nthe tracks of tanks now depend, and all subsequent ideas were founded\r\non this basis.[12]\r\n\r\nThe endless chain track passed through various early patents. In\r\n1801 Thomas German produced “a means of facilitating the transit of\r\ncarriages by substituting endless chains or a series of rollers for the\r\nordinary wheels.” This definitely cut adrift from the idea of wheels\r\nand replaced it by that of tracks. In 1812 William Palmer produced a\r\nsomewhat similar invention, and in 1821 John Richard Barry patented a\r\ncontrivance consisting of two endless pitched chains, stretched out and\r\npassing round two chain wheels at the end of the carriage, one on each\r\nside, which formed the rails or bearing surface of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nFooted wheels were not, however, abandoned, and in 1846 a picture of\r\nthe Boydell engine shows the wheels of this machine fitted with feet.\r\nIn 1861 an improved wheel-foot was patented by Andrew Dunlop which was\r\nmodified by other inventors and by degrees evolved into the pedrail,\r\ntrials of which were carried out at Aldershot under the War Office in\r\n1905.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Guillaume Fender of Buenos Aires suggested and John Newburn\r\npatented certain improvements to endless tracks. Fender realised that\r\nthe attempts to produce endless travelling railways had not met with\r\ngreat success owing to the shortness of the rails or tracks employed;\r\nhe, therefore, proposed that their length should be the same as the\r\ndistance between the vehicle’s axles. If it were desired to have short\r\nlinks the number of wheels must be increased; furthermore, should the\r\ntractor be used for hauling a train of wagons, the endless track should\r\nbe long enough to embrace all the wheels. This is the original idea of\r\nthe all-round track.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM 5. THE APPLEGARTH TRACTOR, 1886.]\r\n\r\nAmong the many interesting patents of about this date were the\r\nApplegarth tractor of 1886 (see Diagram 5) and the Batter tractor of\r\n1888. In the former the forward portion of the track was inclined and\r\nsuggests the contour of the track as applied to the front of tanks. The\r\ntrack being raised in front gives an initial elevation when an obstacle\r\nis met with and very greatly assists in surmounting banks and other\r\nirregularities.\r\n\r\nDiagram 6 depicts the Batter tractor and it clearly shows the basic\r\nideas which have been employed in tank transmission and tank design.\r\nThis tractor was patented in the U.S.A., it was furnished with two\r\ntracks, their contour very closely resembling those of the Medium Mark\r\n“A” (Whippet) and gun-carrier machines (see Plates III and VII) The\r\nmotive power was steam, and two separate engines, fed by one boiler,\r\nwere used, one to drive each track; apparently provision was made, if\r\ndesired, for the crankshafts of these engines to be clutched together.\r\nEach track consisted of two endless belts, an inner and an outer; the\r\nouter belt, that which impinges on the ground, was composed of shoes\r\narranged transversely and coupled together. Between the outer belt and\r\nthe rollers ran the inner belt. The inner belt or link was of much\r\nless width than the outer and thus allowed the latter to swivel and\r\nadapt itself to irregularities of the ground, whilst the working of the\r\nrollers was not interfered with. A system almost identical with this\r\none has recently been adopted for tank tracks.\r\n\r\nThe rollers were alternately flanged and plain, as on tanks. Two tails\r\nfor steering and balancing the machine were fitted; a similar idea was\r\nadopted on Mark I machines and gun carriers, but subsequently discarded.\r\n\r\nThe general introduction of the internal-combustion engine and petrol\r\nas a fuel gave a further impetus to the tracked machine. In 1900 Frank\r\nBramond patented a track which could be applied to pneumatic-tyred\r\nvehicles, either to single wheels or to two pairs of wheels. In 1907\r\na Rochet-Schneider was fitted with a track by Roberts and tested at\r\nAldershot. This car was exhibited together with a 70 h.p. Hornsby\r\nchain-track tractor and took part in the Royal Review at Aldershot in\r\nMay 1908. This same year Hornsby fitted up a 75 h.p. Mercedes motor-car\r\nwith a track to demonstrate its advantages for high-speed work on sand.\r\n“This car was run daily for five months at Skegness, on loose sand, and\r\nit is understood that a speed of twenty miles an hour was obtained.”[13]\r\n\r\nOf later years, American inventors and manufacturers have made great\r\nprogress in chain-track tractors, but practically all the principles of\r\ndesign were originally applied in Great Britain. The Holt caterpillar\r\nis the outstanding American design for tractors which has been adopted\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:_The Engineer._]  DIAGRAM 6. THE BATTER TRACTOR, 1888.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:_The Engineer._]  DIAGRAM 6A. THE BATTER TRACTOR, 1888.]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note with reference to the above inventions that\r\nneither Germany nor Austria ever appears to have contributed any basic\r\nsuggestion relating to track-driven machines.\r\n\r\nTo return now to the military aspect of our subject, gunpowder did\r\naway with armour, for if armour can be pierced its defensive value\r\nis lost and it only becomes an encumbrance to the wearer by reducing\r\nhis mobility and exhausting his muscular energy. Did this change the\r\nmain problem in the art of war? Not at all, for “the giving of blows\r\nwithout receiving them” remains the unchangeable object of battle\r\nirrespective of the change of weapons, and all that happened was, that\r\nthe soldier, no longer being able to seek protection by body-armour,\r\nsought it elsewhere--by manœuvring, by covering fire and entrenchments\r\nas typified in the drill of Frederick the Great, the cannonades and\r\nsharpshooters’ fire of Napoleon, the fortifications of Vauban, and\r\nlater on the use of ground by Wellington as cover from fire.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the war in 1914 saw all sides equipped with similar\r\nweapons and in comparatively similar proportions. The great sweep of\r\nthe Germans through Belgium was followed by the battle of the Marne,\r\na generic term for a series of bloody engagements which raged from\r\nLorraine to Paris. Then came the great reaction--the German retreat\r\nto the Aisne, the heights along which had been hastily prepared for\r\ndefence. The battle swayed whilst vigour lasted and then stabilised as\r\nexhaustion intervened. At first cautiously, then rapidly, did the right\r\nflank of the German Armies and the left flank of those of the French\r\nand British seek to out-manœuvre each other. This led to the race for\r\nthe coast. Meanwhile came the landing of the British 7th Division at\r\nZeebrugge and then the First Battle of Ypres, which closed the German\r\noffensive on the British front for three years and four months.\r\n\r\nThe quick-firing field-gun and the machine-gun, used defensively,\r\nproved too strong for the endurance of the attackers, who were forced\r\nto seek safety by means of their spades, rather than through their\r\nrifles. Whole fronts were entrenched, and before the end of 1914,\r\nexcept for a few small breaks, a man could have walked by trench, had\r\nhe wished to, from Nieuport almost into Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWith the trench came wire entanglements--the horror of the attack,\r\nand the trinity of trench, machine-gun, and wire, made the defence\r\nso strong that each offensive operation in turn was brought to a\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\nThe problem which then confronted us was a twofold one:\r\n\r\nFirstly, how could the soldier in the attack be protected against\r\nshrapnel, shell-splinters, and bullets? Helmets were reintroduced,\r\narmour was tried, shields were invented, but all to no great purpose.\r\n\r\nSecondly, even if bullet-proof armour could be invented, which it\r\ncertainly could, how were men laden down with it going to get through\r\nthe wire entanglements which protected every position?\r\n\r\nThree definite solutions were attempted--the first, artillery; the\r\nsecond, gas; and the third, tanks--each of which is a definite answer\r\nto our problem if the conditions are favourable for its use. Thus\r\nat the battle of the Dunajec, in the spring of 1915, the fire of\r\nMackensen’s massed artillery smashed the Russian front; this success\r\nbeing due as much to the fewness of the Russian guns as to the skill of\r\nthat great soldier. At the Second Battle of Ypres the German surprise\r\ngas attack succeeded because the British and French possessed no\r\nantidote. At the First Battle of Cambrai, the use of tanks on good firm\r\nground proved an overwhelming success, whilst at the Third Battle of\r\nYpres, on account of the mud, they were an all but complete failure.\r\n\r\nAll armies attempted the first method by increasing the number of their\r\nguns, the size of their guns, and the quantity of their ammunition.\r\nSo thoroughly was this done that whole sectors of an enemy’s front\r\nwere blasted out of recognition. This, however, was only accomplished\r\nafter all surprise had been sacrificed by obvious preparation during\r\nwhich notice and time were given to the enemy to mass his reserves\r\nin order to meet the attack. Further than this, though the enemy’s\r\nwire and trenches were destroyed all communications on his side of “No\r\nMan’s Land” were obliterated, with the result that a new obstacle,\r\n“the crumped area,” proved as formidable an antagonist to a continuous\r\nadvance, by hampering supply, as uncut wire had done to a successful\r\nassault, by forbidding infantry movement.\r\n\r\nInstead of solving the problem: “How could mobility be reintroduced\r\non the Western Front?” the great increase in artillery, during 1915\r\nand 1916, only complicated it, for, though the preliminary bombardment\r\ncut the wire and blew in the enemy’s trenches and the creeping barrage\r\nprotected the infantry in a high degree, every artillery attack during\r\ntwo years ended in failure due to want of surprise at its initiation\r\nand the impossibility of adequate supply during its progress.\r\n\r\nThe Germans attempted the second method--gas, and from the Second\r\nBattle of Ypres the chemist fell in alongside the soldier. That gas\r\nmight have won the war is to-day too obvious to need accentuation.\r\nTwo conditions were alone requisite--sufficient gas and a favourable\r\nwind. Fortunately for us the German did not wait long enough to\r\nmanufacture gas in quantity; unfortunately for them the prevailing wind\r\non the Western Front is westerly, consequently when we and the French\r\nretaliated they got more than they ever gave us.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of gas still further complicated the problem, for,\r\nwhilst it is easy for the defender to launch gas clouds, it is\r\ndifficult for an attacker to do so, consequently once soldiers had been\r\nequipped with respirators the defence gained by this method of fighting\r\nand warfare became still more immobile.\r\n\r\nAs regards the British front the opening day of the First Battle of the\r\nSomme, July 1, 1916, showed, through the terrible casualty lists which\r\nfollowed, how far the defence had become the stronger form of war. At\r\nno date in the whole history of the war was a stalemate termination\r\nto all our endeavours more certain. The hopes of nearly two years\r\nwere shattered in a few hours before the ruins of Thiepval, Serre,\r\nand Gommecourt, where our men fell in thousands before the deadly\r\nmachine-gun fire of the enemy. Eleven weeks later, on September 15, a\r\nsolution to the problem became apparent, a solution due to the efforts\r\nof a small band of men, of whose energy and endeavours the next chapter\r\nwill relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE INVENTION OF THE LANDSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed in this chapter to give an answer to the question:\r\n“Who first thought of the tank?” The idea of combining mobility with\r\noffensive power and armour, as the previous chapter has shown, is a\r\nvery old one, so old and so universal throughout history that, when the\r\nGreat War broke out in 1914, many soldiers and civilians alike must\r\nhave considered ways and means of reintroducing the knight in armour\r\nand the battle car by replacing muscular energy by mechanical force--in\r\nother words, by applying petrol to the needs of the battlefield.\r\n\r\nDuring August and September 1914, armoured cars had been employed with\r\nconsiderable success in Belgium and north-western France. This no doubt\r\nbrought with it the revival of the idea. Be this as it may, in October\r\nof this year Lieutenant-Colonel (now Major-General) E. D. Swinton put\r\nforward a suggestion for the construction of an armoured car on the\r\nHolt tractor or a similar caterpillar system, capable of crushing down\r\nwire entanglements and crossing trenches.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Captain T. G. Tulloch, manager of the Chilworth\r\nPowder Company, was also devoting his attention to the possibility\r\nof constructing a land cruiser sufficiently armoured to enable it\r\nto penetrate right up to the enemy’s gun and howitzer positions.\r\nIn November the idea was communicated by Captain Tulloch to\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Swinton and to Lieutenant-Colonel (now Colonel Sir\r\nMaurice) Hankey, Secretary to the “Committee of Imperial Defence,” and\r\nlater on to Mr. Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, who, in\r\nJanuary 1915, wrote his now historic letter to Mr. Asquith:\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR PRIME MINISTER,\r\n\r\n  “I entirely agree with Colonel Hankey’s remarks on the subject of\r\n  special mechanical devices for taking trenches. It is extraordinary\r\n  that the Army in the field and the War Office should have allowed\r\n  nearly three months of warfare to progress without addressing their\r\n  minds to its special problems.\r\n\r\n  “The present war has revolutionised all military theories about\r\n  the field of fire. The power of the rifle is so great that 100\r\n  yards is held sufficient to stop any rush, and in order to avoid\r\n  the severity of the artillery fire, trenches are often dug on\r\n  the reverse slope of positions, or a short distance in the rear\r\n  of villages, woods, or other obstacles. The consequence is that\r\n  the war has become a short-range instead of a long-range war as\r\n  was expected, and opposing trenches get ever closer together, for\r\n  mutual safety from each other’s artillery fire.\r\n\r\n  “The question to be solved is not, therefore, the long attack over\r\n  a carefully prepared glacis of former times, but the actual getting\r\n  across 100 or 200 yards of open space and wire entanglements. All\r\n  this was apparent more than two months ago, but no steps have been\r\n  taken and no preparations made.\r\n\r\n  “It would be quite easy in a short time to fit up a number of\r\n  steam tractors with small armoured shelters, in which men and\r\n  machine-guns could be placed, which would be bullet-proof. Used at\r\n  night they would not be affected by artillery fire to any extent.\r\n  The caterpillar system would enable trenches to be crossed quite\r\n  easily, and the weight of the machine would destroy all wire\r\n  entanglements.\r\n\r\n  “Forty or fifty of these engines, prepared secretly and brought\r\n  into positions at nightfall, could advance quite certainly into the\r\n  enemy’s trenches, smashing away all the obstructions and sweeping\r\n  the trenches with their machine-gun fire, and with grenades thrown\r\n  out of the top. They would then make so many _points d’appui_ for\r\n  the British supporting infantry to rush forward and rally on them.\r\n  They can then move forward to attack the second line of trenches.\r\n\r\n  “The cost would be small. If the experiment did not answer, what\r\n  harm would be done? An obvious measure of prudence would have been\r\n  to have started something like this two months ago. It should\r\n  certainly be done now.\r\n\r\n  “The shield is another obvious experiment which should have been\r\n  made on a considerable scale. What does it matter which is the best\r\n  pattern? A large number should have been made of various patterns;\r\n  some to carry, some to wear, some to wheel. If the mud now prevents\r\n  the working of shields or traction engines, the first frost would\r\n  render them fully effective. With a view to this I ordered a month\r\n  ago twenty shields on wheels, to be made on the best design the\r\n  Naval Air Service could devise. These will be ready shortly, and\r\n  can, if need be, be used for experimental purposes.\r\n\r\n  “A third device, which should be used systematically and on a\r\n  large scale, is smoke artificially produced. It is possible to\r\n  make small smoke barrels which, on being lighted, generate a great\r\n  volume of dense black smoke, which could be turned off or on at\r\n  will. There are other matters closely connected with this to which\r\n  I have already drawn your attention, but which are of so secret a\r\n  character, that I do not put them down on paper.\r\n\r\n  “One of the most serious dangers that we are exposed to is the\r\n  possibility that the Germans are acting and preparing all these\r\n  surprises, and that we may at any time find ourselves exposed\r\n  to some entirely new form of attack. A committee of engineering\r\n  officers and other experts ought to be sitting continually at the\r\n  War Office to formulate schemes and examine suggestions, and I\r\n  would repeat that it is not possible in most cases to have lengthy\r\n  experiments beforehand.\r\n\r\n  “If the devices are to be ready by the time they are required it\r\n  is indispensable that manufacture should proceed simultaneously\r\n  with experiments. The worst that can happen is that a comparatively\r\n  small sum of money is wasted.\r\n\r\n            “Yours, etc.”\r\n\r\nAt about the time that the above letter was written, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nSwinton again brought the matter forward and urged the desirability of\r\naction being taken, but as it was stated that the design and building\r\nof Captain Tulloch’s machine would take a year to complete it appears\r\nthat this led to the proposals being shelved for the time being.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1915, Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton, who had then\r\nreturned to France, submitted an official memorandum on the above\r\nsubject to G.H.Q., which was passed to Major-General G. H. Fowke,\r\nEngineer-in-Chief, for his expert opinion. This memorandum may be\r\nsummarised as follows:\r\n\r\nThe main German offensive was taking place in Russia; consequently, in\r\norder to attain a maximum strength in the east, it was incumbent on\r\nthe Germans to maintain a minimum one in the west; and, in order to\r\nmeet the shortage of men on the Western Front, the Germans were mainly\r\nbasing their defence on the machine-gun.\r\n\r\nThe problem, consequently, was one of how to overcome the German\r\nmachine-gunners. There were two solutions to this problem:\r\n\r\n(i) Sufficient artillery to blast a way through the enemy’s lines.\r\n\r\n(ii) The introduction of armoured machine-gun destroyers.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second solution Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton laid down\r\nthe following requirements: Speed, 4 miles per hour; climbing power, 5\r\nft.; spanning power, 5 ft.; radius of action, 20 miles; weight, about\r\n8 tons; crew, 10 men; armament, 2 machine-guns and one light Q.F. gun.\r\nFurther, he suggested that these machines should be used in a surprise\r\nassault having first been concealed behind our own front line in\r\nspecially constructed pits about 100 yards apart. In this paper it was\r\nalso pointed out that these destroyers would be of great value in a gas\r\nattack, as they would enable the most scientific means of overcoming\r\ngas to be carried.\r\n\r\nThe above memorandum was favourably considered by Sir John French, then\r\nCommander-in-Chief in France, and, on June 22, was submitted by him to\r\nthe War Office with a suggestion that Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton should\r\nvisit England and explain his scheme more fully.\r\n\r\nWhile Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton and Captain Tulloch were urging their\r\nproposals, a third scheme was brought forward by Admiral Sir Reginald\r\nBacon in connection with which the Secretary of State, in January\r\n1915, ordered trials to be carried out with a 105 h.p. Foster-Daimler\r\ntractor fitted with a bridging apparatus for crossing trenches. At\r\nabout the same time similar trials were made with a 120 h.p. Holt\r\ncaterpillar tractor at Shoeburyness in connection with Captain\r\nTulloch’s scheme. Both experiments proved a failure.\r\n\r\nThe position, therefore, in June, so far as the Army was concerned,\r\nwas as follows: Proposals had been put forward by Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nSwinton, Admiral Bacon, and Captain Tulloch, and submitted to the\r\nWar Office. Certain trials had been made, the result of which, in\r\nthe view of the authorities, was to emphasise the engineering and\r\nother difficulties to be overcome. It was only in June 1915 that\r\nMajor-General Sir George Scott-Moncrieff, Director of Fortifications\r\nand Works, War Office, who, throughout the initial period, had\r\nshown a strong interest in the development of the idea, ascertained\r\nthat investigations on similar lines were being carried out by the\r\nAdmiralty; he at once proposed that a “Joint Naval and Military\r\nCommittee” should be formed for the purpose of dealing with the subject\r\ngenerally. This Committee was constituted on June 15.\r\n\r\nThe work done by the Admiralty had so far been independent. In February\r\n1915, Mr. Churchill sent to Mr. E. H. T. (now Sir Eustace) D’Eyncourt,\r\nDirector of Naval Construction, a copy of the notes embodying the\r\nproposals set forth by Major T. G. Hetherington (18th Hussars),\r\nR.N.A.S., for a new type of war machine. This machine may be described\r\nas a veritable Juggernaut, heavily armoured, highly offensive, and\r\ncapable of moving across country.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of a platform mounted on three wheels, two driving wheels\r\nin front and the steering wheel behind. It was to be equipped with\r\nthree turrets each containing two 4-in. guns and its motive power was\r\nto be derived from a 800 h.p. Sunbeam Diesel set of engines.\r\n\r\nThe problem of design was examined by the Air Department engineers and\r\nthe following rough data, worked out at the time, are of interest:\r\n\r\n  Armament                  3 twin 4 in. turrets with 300 rounds per gun.\r\n  Horse power               800 h.p. with fuel for 24 hours.\r\n  Total weight              300 tons.\r\n  Armour                    3 in.\r\n  Diameter of wheels        40 ft.\r\n  Tread of main wheels      13 ft. 4 in.\r\n  Tread of steering wheels  5 ft. O in.\r\n  Overall length            100 ft.\r\n  Overall width             80 ft.\r\n  Overall height            46 ft.\r\n  Clearance                 17 ft.\r\n  Top speed on good going   8 miles per hour.\r\n  Top speed on bad going    4 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe cross-country qualities of the machine it was considered would\r\nprove good. It could not be bogged in any ground passable by cavalry;\r\nit could pass over water obstacles having good banks and from 20 ft.\r\nto 30 ft. width of waterway; it could ford waterways 15 ft. deep if\r\nthe bottoms were good, and negotiate isolated obstacles up to 20 ft.\r\nhigh. Small obstacles such as banks, ditches, bridges, trenches, wire\r\nentanglements, and ordinary woodland it could roll over easily.\r\n\r\nMr. D’Eyncourt considered this proposal, but coming to the conclusion\r\nthat the machine would weigh more than 1,000 tons, it became apparent\r\nto him that its construction was not a practical proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. D’Eyncourt pointed this out to Mr. Churchill and suggested that\r\nMajor Hetherington’s machine should be replaced by one of a smaller and\r\nless ambitious type. To this Mr. Churchill agreed, and to deal with\r\nthis question a “Landships Committee” was formed consisting of the\r\nfollowing gentlemen:\r\n\r\n                              _Chairman._\r\n                            Mr. D’EYNCOURT.\r\n\r\n                               _Members._\r\n              Major HETHERINGTON, Colonel DUMBLE, Mr. DALE\r\n                       BUSSELL (appointed later).\r\n\r\n                             _Consultant._\r\n                        Colonel R. E. CROMPTON.\r\n\r\n                     _Secretary_ (appointed later).\r\n                           Lieutenant STERN.\r\n\r\nPrior to the formation of this Committee another proposal had been set\r\non foot. About November 14, 1914, Mr. Diplock of the Pedrail Company\r\nhad put forward certain suggestions for the use of the pedrail for the\r\ntransportation of heavy guns and war material over rough ground. After\r\ninterviewing Lord Kitchener, who saw no utility in the suggestion, Mr.\r\nDiplock was referred to the Admiralty and there saw Mr. Churchill, who,\r\ntaking up the matter with interest, suggested that a one-ton truck\r\nshould be brought to the Horse Guards Parade for his inspection. Major\r\nHetherington undertook to arrange this, and on February 12, 1915, a\r\ndemonstration of the Pedrail machine took place.\r\n\r\nThis so impressed Mr. Churchill that he decided that a pedrail armoured\r\ncar should be built.\r\n\r\nThe “Landships Committee” communicated with Messrs. William Foster,\r\nLtd., of Lincoln, who were already making heavy tractors for the\r\nAdmiralty, and Mr. (now Sir William) Tritton, their manager, was asked\r\nto collaborate in evolving two designs:\r\n\r\nThe first of the wheel tractor type.\r\n\r\nThe second of the pedrail type--\r\n\r\nthe latter being the alternative recommended by the chairman and the\r\nPedrail Company.\r\n\r\nBoth these designs seemed to have some promising features. The First\r\nLord, on March 26, approved of an order being placed for twelve of the\r\npedrail type and six of the wheel type.\r\n\r\nThe design of the pedrail machine was produced by the Pedrail Company;\r\nits length was 38 ft., its width 12 ft. 6 in., and height 10 ft. 6 in.\r\nThe most interesting feature connected with this machine was that it\r\nwas mounted on two bogies one behind the other, steering being rendered\r\npossible by articulating these bogies in the same horizontal plane,\r\nwhich gave an extreme turning radius of 65ft.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Churchill’s resignation from the Admiralty the production of\r\nthe twelve pedrail cars was abandoned in spite of the fact that the\r\nengines and most of the material had been provided.\r\n\r\nThe design work was, however, continued under the direction of the\r\n“Landships Committee,” and, a little later on, caterpillar tractors\r\nfor experimental purposes were obtained from America. In the meantime\r\nthe question of design was discussed with Mr. Tritton, and at the same\r\ntime Lieutenant (now Major) W. G. Wilson, an experienced engineer, was\r\nbrought in as consultant, and a design was evolved which eventually\r\nembodied the form finally adopted and adhered to for tanks. Thus it\r\nwas through the “Landships Committee,” at a moment when the military\r\nauthorities were inclined to regard the difficulties connected with the\r\nproblem as likely to prove insuperable, that the landship or “tank,” as\r\nit was later on called, was first brought into being.\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the “Joint Naval and Military Committee” on\r\nJune 15, it was agreed, as the result of correspondence between the\r\nAdmiralty and War Office, that the experimental work on the landship\r\nshould be taken over as a definite military service in the department\r\nof the Master-General of Ordnance. It was further agreed that the\r\nDirector of Fortifications and Works should be president of the\r\nCommittee, that the chairman and members of the existing “Landships\r\nCommittee” should continue to serve as long as their assistance was\r\nrequired, and that the late First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill,\r\nshould remain in touch with the design and construction of the machines\r\nduring their experimental stage. The members nominated for the\r\nCommittee by the War Office were Colonel Bird of the General Staff,\r\nColonel Holden, A.D.T., and Major Wheeler of the M.G.O.’s Department.\r\n\r\nEarly in July, Mr. Lloyd George, Minister of Munitions, discussed with\r\nMr. Balfour, now First Lord of the Admiralty, the transference of\r\nthe production of the machines from the Admiralty to the Ministry of\r\nMunitions. It was, however, subsequently decided that the Admiralty\r\nshould be responsible for the production of the first trial machine,\r\nthe Director of Naval Construction being responsible for the completion\r\nof the machine. This was strongly urged by Sir George Scott-Moncrieff.\r\n\r\nIn July 1915, Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton returned to England to take\r\nover the duties of assistant secretary to the “Committee of Imperial\r\nDefence.” He at once took in hand the co-ordination of the various\r\nprivate and official efforts which were being made at this time in\r\nrelation to the design of caterpillar tractors. Early in September\r\nhe visited Lincoln and inspected a machine known as Little Willie,\r\nand on the 10th of this month wrote to Major Guest, Secretary of the\r\n“Experiments Committee” at G.H.Q., as follows:\r\n\r\n  “The naval people are pressing on with the first sample caterpillar\r\n  ... they have succeeded in making an animal that will cross 4 ft. 6\r\n  in. and turn on its own axis like a dog with a flea in its tail....”\r\n\r\nIn spite of its agility this machine was rejected in favour of Big\r\nWillie, a model of which was being constructed under the direction\r\nof the “Joint Committee” on the lines of the machine designed by Mr.\r\nTritton and Lieutenant Wilson and the requirements of which had been\r\noutlined by Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton in his memorandum of June 1.\r\n\r\nAs regards these requirements, on the day following the above letter\r\nthe “Experiments Committee” G.H.Q. sent the following tactical\r\nsuggestions, arising out of Colonel Swinton’s original proposal, to\r\nthe secretary of the “Committee of Imperial Defence.” They are worth\r\nquoting as they embody several of the characteristics which were\r\nintroduced in the Mark I tank.\r\n\r\n(1) The object for which the caterpillar cruiser or armoured fort is\r\nrequired is for employment in considerable numbers in conjunction with\r\nor as an incident in a larger and general attack by infantry against an\r\nextended front.\r\n\r\n(2) As a general principle, it is desirable to have a large number of\r\nsmall cruisers rather than a smaller number of large ones.\r\n\r\n(3) The armour of the cruiser must be proof against concentrated rifle\r\nand machine-gun fire, but not proof against artillery fire. The whole\r\ncruiser should be enclosed in armour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I\r\n\r\nLITTLE WILLIE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARK IV TANK (FEMALE).]\r\n\r\n(4) The tactical object of the cruiser is attack, its armament should\r\ninclude a gun with reasonable accuracy up to 1,000 yards, and at least\r\ntwo Lewis guns, which can be fired from loopholes to flank and to rear.\r\n\r\n(5) The crew to consist of six men--two for the gun, one for each Lewis\r\ngun, and two drivers.\r\n\r\n(6) The caterpillar must be capable of crossing craters produced by\r\nthe explosion of high-explosive shell, such craters being of 12 ft.\r\ndiameter, 6 ft. deep, with sloping sides; of crossing an extended width\r\nof barbed-wire entanglements; and of spanning hostile trenches with\r\nperpendicular sides and of 4 ft. in breadth.\r\n\r\n(7) The cruiser should be capable of moving at a rate of not less than\r\n2½ miles per hour over broken ground, and should have a range of action\r\nof not less than six hours consecutive movement.\r\n\r\n(8) The wheels of the cruiser should be on either the “Pedrail” system\r\nor the “Caterpillar” system; whichever is the most suitable for\r\ncrossing marshy and slippery ground.\r\n\r\nMost of these requirements had already been embodied in the wooden\r\nmodel of Big Willie, which, when completed, was inspected at Wembley on\r\nSeptember 28. This model was accepted as a basis on which construction\r\nwas to proceed, it was in fact the first “mock up” of the eventual Mark\r\nI machine.\r\n\r\nBig Willie was about 8 ft. high, 26 ft. long, and 11 ft. wide without\r\nsponsons, and 3 ft. wider when these were added. His armament consisted\r\nin two 6-pounder guns and two machine-guns, and the crew suggested was\r\n1 officer and 9 other ranks.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the “Joint Committee” assembled at the Admiralty\r\nand decided that the following specifications should be worked to:\r\nweight 22 tons, speed 3½ miles per hour, spanning power 8 ft., and\r\nclimbing power 4½ ft.\r\n\r\nOn December 3, Mr. Churchill addressed a paper to G.H.Q., entitled\r\n“Variants of the Offensive,” in which he accentuated the necessity of\r\nconcentrating more than we had done on “the attack by armour,” the\r\nchief purpose of armour being to preserve mobility. He suggested\r\nthe combined use of the caterpillar tractor and the shield. The\r\ncaterpillars were to breach the enemy’s line and then turn right and\r\nleft, the infantry following under cover of bullet-proof shields. It\r\nwas further suggested that the attack might be carried out at night\r\nunder the guidance of searchlights. The rest of this paper dealt with\r\n“Attack by Trench Mortars, Attack by the Spade, and The Attack on the\r\nFirst Line.”\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day 1915, Sir Douglas Haig, who had recently taken\r\nover command of the Expeditionary Force in France, read this\r\npaper, and wishing to know more about the caterpillars mentioned,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel H. J. Elles (later on G.O.C. Tank Corps) was sent\r\nto England to ascertain the exact position. On January 8 this officer\r\nreported in writing to G.H.Q., as follows:\r\n\r\n“There are two producers of landships:\r\n\r\n“(_a_) Trench Warfare working alone.[14]\r\n\r\n“(_b_) The Admiralty Landship Committee working with the War Office.\r\n\r\n“The first have not yet made a machine, but its proposed size is 10 ft.\r\nhigh, 14 ft. 6 in. wide, and 36 ft. long; the second was in process of\r\nbeing made” (_i.e._ Big Willie).\r\n\r\nUp to December 20, 1915, the whole cost of the experimental work had\r\nbeen defrayed by the Admiralty, which had also provided the personnel\r\nin the shape of No. 20 Squadron, R.N.A.S., for carrying out the work.\r\nThe Admiralty had in fact fathered and been responsible for the\r\nlandship since its first inception.\r\n\r\nOn December 24 the following recommendations were formulated at a\r\nConference held at the offices of the “Committee of Imperial Defence”:\r\n\r\n  “SUPPLY OF MACHINES\r\n\r\n  “(1) That if and when the Army Council, after inspection of the\r\n  final experimental land cruiser, decide that such machines shall\r\n  be entrusted to a small ‘Executive Supply Committee,’ which, for\r\n  secrecy, shall be called the ‘Tank[15] Supply Committee,’ and shall\r\n  come into existence as soon as the decision of the Army Council is\r\n  made.\r\n\r\n  “(2) That this Committee shall be responsible for the supply of\r\n  caterpillar machine-gun destroyers or land cruisers of the approved\r\n  type; complete in every respect for action, including both primary\r\n  and secondary armament. That it shall receive instructions as to\r\n  supply and design direct from the General Staff, War Office, the\r\n  necessary financial arrangements being made by the Accounting\r\n  Officer, War Office.\r\n\r\n  “(3) That, in order to enable the committee to carry out its work\r\n  with the maximum of despatch and minimum of reference, it shall\r\n  have full power to place orders, and to correspond direct with any\r\n  Government department concerned. To be in a position to do this, it\r\n  should have placed to its credit, as soon as its work commences,\r\n  a sum equivalent to the estimated cost of fifty machines, which\r\n  sum should be increased later if necessary by any further amount\r\n  required to carry out the programme of construction approved by the\r\n  General Staff. The committee should also be authorised to incur\r\n  any necessary expenditure in connection with experimental work,\r\n  engagement of staff, travelling and other incidental expenses\r\n  during the progress of the work.\r\n\r\n  “(4) That as the machines are turned out and equipped they shall\r\n  be handed over to the War Office for the purpose of training the\r\n  personnel to man them.\r\n\r\n  “(5) That the Committee be reconstituted with Lieutenant A. G.\r\n  Stern as chairman.\r\n\r\n  “(6) That since the officers of the R.N.A.S. will cease to\r\n  belong to that service as soon as the ‘Tank Supply Committee’ is\r\n  constituted, arrangements shall be made now for their payment from\r\n  the same source that will bear the cost of constructing the land\r\n  cruisers and for their appointment as military officers with rank\r\n  suitable to the importance of their duties.”\r\n\r\nThe experimental machine was completed towards the end of 1915 and its\r\npreliminary trials gave most promising results.\r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1916, Mr. D’Eyncourt, as head of the “Admiralty\r\nCommittee,” entrusted with the design and manufacture of the trial\r\nmachine, wrote to Lord Kitchener and informed him that the machine\r\nwas ready for his inspection and that it fulfilled all the conditions\r\nlaid down by the War Office, viz.--that it could carry guns, destroy\r\nmachine-guns, break through wire entanglements, and cross the enemy’s\r\ntrenches, whilst giving protection to its own crew. Mr. D’Eyncourt\r\nalso recommended that a number should be ordered immediately to this\r\nmodel, without serious alteration, and that whilst these were being\r\nmanufactured the design of a more formidable machine could be developed.\r\n\r\nOn February 2 the first official trial of the new machine was held at\r\nHatfield and was witnessed by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,\r\nMr. Lloyd George, Mr. McKenna, and various representatives of the War\r\nOffice and Ministry of Munitions. Following this trial G.H.Q., France,\r\non February 8 signified their approval of the machine and asked that\r\nthe Army might be supplied with a certain number.\r\n\r\nArising out of the Hatfield trial it was decided to form a small\r\nunit of the Machine-Gun Corps, to be called the “Heavy Section,”\r\nand Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton was appointed to command it with his\r\nHeadquarters in London, a training camp being first opened at Bisley\r\nand later on moved to Elveden near Thetford.\r\n\r\nAs the “Admiralty Committee,” with the Director of Naval Construction\r\nas chairman, had finished their work and produced an actual machine\r\ncomplete in all respects and fulfilling all requirements, it was then\r\ndecided that the Ministry of Munitions should take over the production\r\nof the machines. On February 10 the Army Council consequently addressed\r\na letter to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty requesting them\r\nto convey “the very warm thanks of the Army Council to Mr. E. H. T.\r\nD’Eyncourt, C.B., Director of Naval Construction, and his Committee,\r\nfor their work in evolving a machine for the use of the Army, and to\r\nMr. W. A. Tritton and Lieutenant W. G. Wilson, R.N.A.S., for their work\r\nin design and construction.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on February 12, the “Joint Committee” was dissolved\r\nand a new committee, closely following the lines laid down at the\r\nConference held in the offices of the “Committee of Imperial Defence,”\r\nwas formed under the Ministry of Munitions, and known as the “Tank\r\nSupply Committee.”\r\n\r\n  _Chairman._\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant A. G. STERN, R.N.A.S., Director of Naval Constructions\r\n    Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Members._\r\n\r\n  E. H. T. D’EYNCOURT, Esq., C.B., Director of Naval Construction.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel E. D. SWINTON, D.S.O., R.E., Assistant\r\n    Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.\r\n\r\n  Major G. L. WHEELER, R.A., Director of Artillery’s Branch, War\r\n    Office.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant W. G. WILSON, R.N.A.S., Director of Naval Constructions\r\n    Committee.\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant K. P. SYMES, R.N.A.S., Director of Naval Constructions\r\n    Committee.\r\n\r\n  P. DALE-BUSSELL, Esq., Director of Naval Constructions Committee,\r\n    Contract Department, Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Consultant._\r\n\r\n  Captain T. G. TULLOCH, Ministry of Munitions.\r\n\r\nOn February 14, 1916, Mr. D’Eyncourt wrote the following letter, which\r\nwe quote in full, to Lieutenant-Colonel W. S. Churchill, commanding 6th\r\nRoyal Scots Fusiliers, B.E.F., France, whose initiative and foresight\r\nwere the true parents of the tank as a war machine:\r\n\r\n  “DEAR COLONEL CHURCHILL,\r\n\r\n  “It is with great pleasure that I am now able to report to you that\r\n  the War Office have at last ordered 100 landships to the pattern\r\n  which underwent most successful trials recently. Sir D. Haig sent\r\n  some of his staff from the front.\r\n\r\n  “Lord Kitchener and Robertson also came, and members of the\r\n  Admiralty Board. The machine was complete in almost every detail\r\n  and fulfils all the requirements finally given me by the War\r\n  Office. The official tests of trenches, etc., were nothing to\r\n  it, and finally we showed them how it could cross a 9 ft. gap\r\n  after climbing a 4 ft. 6 in. high perpendicular parapet. Wire\r\n  entanglements it goes through like a rhinoceros through a field\r\n  of corn. It carries two 6-pounder guns in sponsons (a _naval_\r\n  touch), and about 300 rounds; also smaller machine-guns, and is\r\n  proof against machine-gun fire. It can be conveyed by rail (the\r\n  sponsons and guns take off, making it lighter) and be ready for\r\n  action very quickly. The King came[16] and saw it and was greatly\r\n  struck by its performance, as was every one else; in fact, they\r\n  were all astonished. It is capable of great development, but to get\r\n  a sufficient number in time, I strongly urge ordering immediately a\r\n  good many to the pattern which we know all about. As you are aware,\r\n  it has taken much time and trouble to get the thing perfect, and\r\n  a practical machine simple to make; we tried various types and\r\n  did much experimental work. I am sorry it has taken so long, but\r\n  pioneer work always takes time and no avoidable delay has taken\r\n  place, though I begged them to order ten for training purposes two\r\n  months ago. I have also had some difficulty in steering the scheme\r\n  past the rocks of opposition and the more insidious shoals of\r\n  apathy which are frequented by red herrings, which cross the main\r\n  line of progress at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\n  “The great thing now is to keep the whole matter secret and produce\r\n  the machines altogether as a complete surprise. I have already\r\n  put the manufacture in hand, under the ægis of the Minister of\r\n  Munitions, who is very keen; the Admiralty is also allowing me to\r\n  continue to carry on with the same Committee, but Stern is now\r\n  Chairman.\r\n\r\n  “I enclose photo. In appearance, it looks rather like a great\r\n  antediluvian monster, especially when it comes out of boggy ground,\r\n  which it traverses easily. The wheels behind form a rudder for\r\n  steering a curve, and also ease the shock over banks, etc., but\r\n  are not absolutely necessary, as it can steer and turn in its own\r\n  length with the independent tracks.\r\n\r\n            “E. H. T. D’EYNCOURT.”\r\n\r\nBetween its institution in February and the following August the “Tank\r\nSupply Committee” underwent certain slight changes of organisation,\r\nthe distribution of its duties rightly tending more and more towards\r\ncentralisation. Shortly after its formation a “Tank Supply Department”\r\nwas created in the Ministry of Munitions to work with the “Tank\r\nSupply Committee.” This Supply Department was concerned with and was\r\nresponsible for the initial output of the tanks which figured in the\r\nBattle of the Somme.\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1916, the following resolutions were come to by the “Tank\r\nSupply Committee,” and agreed to by the Minister of Munitions:\r\n\r\n“That the ‘Tank Supply Committee’ should in future be named the\r\n‘Advisory Committee of the Tank Supply Department.’\r\n\r\n“That a Sub-Committee consisting of Mr. D’Eyncourt, Mr. Bussell, and\r\nthe Chairman, should be appointed to decide in questions of design and\r\npolicy.”\r\n\r\nOn August 22, the Committee was dissolved on the ground that the\r\norganisation for Tank Supply must be assimilated to that of the other\r\nDepartments of the Ministry of Munitions, and the outcome of this was\r\nthe formation of the “Mechanical Warfare Supply Department,” with\r\nLieutenant Stern as Chairman. This department continued in existence\r\nfrom now on until the end of the war. Its powers were wide, embracing\r\nproduction, design, inspection and the supply of tanks, and its energy\r\nwas unlimited.\r\n\r\nWhilst all these changes were in progress the tanks were being\r\nproduced, and the personnel assembled and trained, and on August 13,\r\n1916, the first detachment of thirteen tanks, being the right half of\r\n“C” Company, left Thetford for France, to be followed on August 22 by\r\ntwelve tanks to complete the complement of “C” Company. On August 25\r\nthe right half of “D” Company entrained at Thetford for France, and on\r\nAugust 30 the remainder of the company followed. Tanks on arrival in\r\nFrance were transported to Yvrench, near Abbeville, where a training\r\ncentre had been established under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBrough, who had proceeded to France on August 3, to make the necessary\r\narrangements. On September 4, Colonel Brough, having organised the\r\ntraining, returned to England, and Lieutenant-Colonel Bradley took over\r\ncommand of the Heavy Section.\r\n\r\nIt was now decided by G.H.Q. that tanks should take part in the next\r\ngreat attack in the Somme battle on September 15, so, on the 7th, 8th,\r\nand 9th of this month, “C” and “D” Companies moved to the forward area,\r\nand established their headquarters at the Loop, a railway centre not\r\nfar from the village of Bray-sur-Somme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TANKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following very brief account of the mechanical characteristics of\r\ntanks, it is hoped, will prove sufficiently simple and complete to give\r\nto the non-mechanical reader some idea of the tank as a machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARK I TANK (see Frontispiece)\r\n\r\nThe first British tank made, and to be used, was the heavy machine,\r\nalready described in the previous chapter, the Mark I tank, the general\r\noutline of which remained the standard design for the hulls of all\r\nBritish heavy machines up to the end of the war. As will be shown\r\nlater, many mechanical improvements, making for higher efficiency and\r\ngreater simplicity of control, were introduced from time to time, but\r\nthe fact remains that the profile of the Mark V tank of 1918 was to\r\nall intents and purposes that of the Mark I of 1916, and surely this\r\nis a striking tribute to the genius of the designers who, without much\r\nprevious data upon which to base their work, produced the parent weapon.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed here to enter upon the general arrangement of the\r\nMark I tank, but reference to two important points in design is of\r\ninterest. The first is that this machine was fitted with a “tail,”\r\nconsisting of a pair of heavy large-diameter wheels, mounted at the\r\nrear of the machine upon a carriage, which was pivoted to the hull in\r\nsuch a manner that the wheels were free to follow the varying contours\r\nof the ground. A number of strong springs normally kept the wheels\r\nbearing heavily upon the ground, whilst a hydraulic ram, operated by an\r\noil pump driven from the engine, was intended to enable the carriage to\r\nbe rocked upon its axis, in order to raise the wheels well clear of\r\nthe ground on occasions when it was necessary to “swing” the tank.\r\n\r\nThe object of this “tail” device was to provide means of steering the\r\nmachine and, to this end, the driver was provided with a steering\r\nwheel which, operating a wire cable over a bobbin or drum, altered the\r\npath of the “tail” wheels, and allowed the tank to be steered, under\r\nfavourable conditions, through a circle having a diameter of about\r\nsixty yards. The disadvantages of this fitting far outweighed any\r\nvirtues it may have possessed. Countless troubles were experienced with\r\nthe ram and its pump; the wire steering cable was constantly stretching\r\nor slipping through the bobbin, thus affecting the “lock” of the tail\r\nwheels; the driver was subjected to great physical strain in overcoming\r\nthe tremendous resistance offered by the road wheels; the whole device\r\nwas very prone to be damaged by shell-fire in action. Against these\r\nindictments should be recorded the fact that the possession of a\r\n“tail” enabled the Mark I tank successfully to span and cross a wider\r\ntrench than the later “tailless” machines of the same dimensions could\r\nnegotiate, owing to the fact that as the wheels supported the rear\r\nof the tank over the point of balance, the risk of “tail dive” was\r\nconsiderably reduced. However, at the close of the operations of 1916,\r\nall tanks were shorn of their tails, and no subsequent models were\r\nfitted with them.\r\n\r\nThe second point of interest regarding this early machine relates to\r\nits sponsons. These, on both the male and female machines (armed with\r\nfull length 6-pounder and Vickers machine-guns respectively) were\r\nplanted upon and bolted to the walls of the hull and, for entraining\r\npurposes, these had to be removed and carried upon special trolleys\r\nwhich could be towed behind the tanks. It will readily be seen that\r\nthis arrangement involved a considerable amount of labour, and rendered\r\nthe process of entraining an extremely lengthy one; this led to an\r\nimproved form of sponson being produced for the Mark IV machine.\r\n\r\nThe chief outstanding weaknesses of the Mark I machine, disclosed\r\nduring the first appearance in action, were:\r\n\r\nThat the engine was provided with no silencer, consequently the noise,\r\nsparks, and even flames, which proceeded from the open exhaust pipes,\r\npassing through the roof of the tank, constituted a grave danger during\r\nthe latter stages of an approach march. Many ingenious tank crews\r\nfitted to their machines crude types of silencers made out of oil\r\ndrums, or adopted the plan of damping out the sparks by using wet sacks\r\nin relays, or covering the exhaust pipe with clay and mud.\r\n\r\nThat the observation from the inside of the machine was bad, and\r\nefficient fire control was, therefore, impossible.\r\n\r\nThat the means provided for entering and leaving the tank were\r\nunsatisfactory, and, in the case of the female machine, speedy\r\nevacuation in the event of fire was difficult.\r\n\r\nThat the whole of the petrol supply was carried inside the machine, and\r\nin a vulnerable position--a circumstance which added to the risk of\r\nfire in the event of a hit in the petrol tank by armour-piercing bullet\r\nor shell. Furthermore, gravity was the only means for transferring\r\npetrol from the main petrol tanks in the front of the machine to\r\nthe carburetter, and, therefore, it frequently happened that when a\r\ntank “ditched” nose downwards, the petrol supply was cut off, and\r\nconsequently the dangerous practice of “hand-feeding” had to be\r\nresorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARK II AND MARK III TANKS\r\n\r\nThese machines were produced in small numbers, and their difference\r\nfrom Mark I lay in various minor improvements, none of a radical nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARK IV TANK (Plate I--see p. 26)\r\n\r\nIn 1917 this tank became the standard fighting machine of the Tank\r\nCorps, and it was used in battle throughout this year and the\r\nfollowing. As already stated, in outline it corresponded so closely\r\nwith the Mark I machine that a study here of the main features of this\r\ntank will serve generally as an illustration of what had taken place in\r\ntank development up to this date.\r\n\r\nThe machine was 26 ft. 5 in. long over all, whilst the width of the\r\nfemale over its sponsons was 10 ft. 6 in., and of the male, 13 ft.\r\n6 in. The height of the machine was 8 ft. 2 in., and its weight,\r\nequipped, was 28 tons. The armament consisted, in the case of the male,\r\nof two 6-pounder guns and four machine-guns, and in that of the female\r\nof six machine-guns; it was fitted with a 105 h.p. Daimler 6-cylinder\r\nsleeve-valve engine which, at a later date, was replaced in a limited\r\nnumber by one of 125 h.p. This increased power was obtained by the use\r\nof aluminium pistons, twin carburetters, and by speeding up the engine.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, these engines gave very little trouble, although\r\nsomewhat under-powered for the work they had to perform. They were, it\r\nmay be added, particularly suitable from the maintenance point of view,\r\nowing to their “fool-proof” nature, due chiefly to the absence of the\r\nusual poppet-valve gear, with its attendant risk of maladjustment.\r\n\r\nPower was transmitted from the engine flywheel, through a cone-type\r\nclutch and a flexible coupling, to a two-speed and reverse gear-box,\r\nknown as the primary gear, this being under the direct control of the\r\ndriver, who could thus obtain first and second speeds, or reverse,\r\nwithout other assistance.\r\n\r\nThe tail-shaft from the gear-box carried a worm which drove the\r\ncrown wheel of a large reduction gear, this gear also serving as a\r\ndifferential to enable the track driving wheels to rotate at different\r\nspeeds, as when steering the tank on its track brakes. A device was\r\nprovided, under the driver’s control, for locking the differential\r\nwhen it was desired to steer a dead-ahead course, or when negotiating\r\na trench or other obstacle. With the differential locked, the gear\r\nbecame, so to speak, “solid” and obviated the risk of one of the tracks\r\nslipping in bad ground, a condition very apt to cause a tank to slip\r\nsideways into a trench and become ditched.\r\n\r\nSome trouble was caused through breakages of this locking muff in the\r\nearlier days, but latterly the arrangement was considerably improved\r\nand strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe gear-box tail-shaft terminated in a brake drum, the band of which\r\nwas operated by means of a pedal at the driver’s foot. It may be of\r\ninterest to point out here that the whole of the items so far referred\r\nto, _i.e._ engine, gear-box, and differential, formed the standard\r\npower unit of the pre-war Foster-Daimler tractor, and thus provided a\r\nknown quantity around which the rest of the detail was designed. This\r\ngreatly facilitated production.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the differential case projected cross-shafts, the\r\nouter ends of which were supported in bearings mounted upon the\r\noutside wall of the tank, and, between the inner and outer walls of\r\nthe hull, two sliding pinions were carried on a splined portion of the\r\ncross-shaft, one pair of pinions on each of the right and left hand\r\nsides of the tank.\r\n\r\nIn describing the remainder of the transmission, it will suffice to\r\ndeal only with one side of the machine, the detail on either side being\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nThe sliding pinions, already alluded to, were operated by means of\r\nshort levers by two gearsmen, whose sole duty it was to assist the\r\ndriver, who signalled to them his requirements from his seat in the\r\nfront of the tank, the two gearsmen being accommodated towards the rear\r\nof the machine on seats placed over the primary gear-box. The sliding\r\npinions were of two sizes, known as the high-speed and low-speed\r\npinions, and immediately in their rear was mounted another pinion\r\nassembly, also carrying two gear-wheels of different dimensions, with\r\nwhich the sliding wheels could be engaged at will--in other words,\r\non each side of the tank there existed what were known as secondary\r\ngear-boxes, each offering a choice of two speeds.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that the whole arrangement provided a range of\r\nfour speeds. Assuming the secondary gears to be at “low,” the driver\r\nhad the option of using either first or second speed by manipulating\r\nthe control to the primary gear-box, whilst in order to obtain third\r\nor fourth (top) speed it was necessary for him to signal the gearsmen\r\nto alter their gears to “high,” and to assist them in the process by\r\na great deal of intelligent clutch work. It need hardly be pointed\r\nout that this arrangement was exceedingly clumsy, and often involved\r\nmuch loss of time and temper. It might also be mentioned here that the\r\nreverse gear, already alluded to, was considerably higher than the\r\nlowest forward speed, so that there was little possibility of driving\r\nbackwards, clear of any obstruction which might have ditched the tank.\r\n\r\nHand-operated brakes, under the control of the tank commander in the\r\nfront of the tank, alongside the driver, were incorporated with the\r\nsecondary gear-box. These brakes, by checking one or other track,\r\nenabled the tank to be steered in some measure with the differential\r\nunlocked, whilst, by locking the differential and placing, say, the\r\nright-hand secondary gear in “neutral,” the machine could be swung to\r\nthe right, practically upon its own axis, by applying the right-hand\r\nbrake. To swing to the left, the right-hand secondary gear was engaged,\r\nthe left-hand being placed in “neutral,” the differential locked and\r\nthe left-hand brake applied.\r\n\r\nFrom the secondary gear-box a Coventry chain transmitted the power to\r\nan assembly, at the rear of the hull, which carried, on either side of\r\nthe chain sprocket, two heavy pinion wheels, in constant mesh with the\r\nfinal sprocket wheels, which in turn, engaging with the links of the\r\ntrack plates, drove the hull along the track.\r\n\r\nEach track was composed, normally, of ninety plates or road shoes,\r\nthe separate plates being coupled together by means of links (two per\r\nplate) and link pins, the links themselves being recessed so as to\r\nengage with the driving wheels as shown above.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the machine was carried upon the track by means of\r\nrollers, whilst the track was supported on the top of the hull by skids\r\nor rails.\r\n\r\nAdjustment of track was effected by the movement of an “idler” wheel,\r\nwhich guided the track over the nose of the hull.\r\n\r\nRefinements to the transmission were introduced in the shape of guards\r\nto protect the driving chains from mud, and also means were provided\r\nto lubricate the secondary gear-wheels with oil. It is recalled that,\r\nprior to the introduction of the chain-guard, the inside deck of the\r\ntanks was often covered with a layer of liquid mud, several inches\r\ndeep, carried in by the chains, and delivered through the secondary\r\ngears.\r\n\r\nPetrol was supplied to the engine in the earlier days of the Mark IV\r\nmachine by a pressure-fed system which gave a great deal of trouble,\r\nand, being also considered dangerous, was finally discarded in favour\r\nof the Autovac system, which sucked the fuel from the main supply in\r\na tank outside of the machine and delivered it to the carburetter by\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nCooling of the engine was primarily effected by a copper envelope\r\nradiator, which gave some trouble and was finally superseded by a\r\ntubular type.\r\n\r\nAn efficient silencer, with a long exhaust pipe carried right to the\r\nrear of the machine, considerably reduced engine noise and rendered the\r\napproach march a far less hazardous undertaking than was the case with\r\nthe earlier models.\r\n\r\nSponsons were designed to collapse into the interior of the machine\r\nwhen necessary, and the cumbersome practice of detaching them from the\r\nhull came to an end. Short 6-pounder guns were introduced to render\r\nthis change possible.\r\n\r\nDetachable “spuds,” to provide a grip for the tracks on difficult soil,\r\nwere first introduced for this machine, as also was a highly efficient\r\nunditching gear. The latter consisted of a beam, rather longer than the\r\noverall width of the tank hull, which was fastened by clips and chains\r\nto each track, and, in passing round under the machine, actually took a\r\npurchase from the obstruction under the belly of the tank.\r\n\r\nDetail improvements to give easier entrance and more rapid egress in\r\ncase of emergency, as well as better and safer vision and fire control,\r\nwere also introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARK V TANK (Plate V--see p. 204)\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the Mark V tank, which represents the standard\r\nBritish heavy tank of to-day, great progress was made in all-round\r\nspeed, ease of manœuvre, radius of action, simplicity of control and\r\nfeasibility of observation.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions and weight of this tank were approximately the same\r\nas those of the Mark IV, whilst the design of the hull still closely\r\nfollowed the lines of the original Mark I. Equipped with the 150 h.p.\r\nRicardo 6-cylinder poppet-valved engine, specially designed for tank\r\nwork, the advent of the Mark V machine called for the introduction of\r\nnew courses of instruction for the personnel of the Corps, very few of\r\neither officers or other ranks having, at this time, any experience of\r\nthe care and adjustment of the valve gear.\r\n\r\nThis Ricardo engine, of somewhat unorthodox design, was highly\r\nefficient and, with proper care and attention, gave very little\r\ntrouble. From the engine, power was transmitted through a plate clutch\r\nin the flywheel to a four-speed gear-box, immediately in rear of\r\nwhich was the reverse gear, providing “reverse” _on all speeds_. The\r\ncross-shaft, incorporated with the reverse gear, carried at either end\r\n(in the same relative position as the secondary gears, explained in\r\ndealing with the Mark IV machine) an epicyclic gear. It is not within\r\nthe scope of this chapter to describe this gear in detail, but it may\r\nbe regarded as serving the double purpose of a reduction gear and\r\nclutch, combined in one unit.\r\n\r\nFrom these epicyclic gears, the transmission of the drive through to\r\nthe tracks followed the principle of the Mark IV machine, except that\r\nthere was no second-line pinion assembly as in the secondary gear of\r\nthe earlier tank, the Coventry chain on the Mark V passing direct from\r\nthe single-unit epicyclic gear to the pinion assembly operating the\r\ntrack driving wheels.\r\n\r\nAll the items enumerated above were under the direct control of the\r\ndriver, who was therefore enabled to perform, single-handed, all the\r\noperations which previously required the work of four men. Hand levers\r\ncontrolled the epicyclic gears, primary gear-box, and reverse gear,\r\nwhilst the clutch and gear were foot-operated.\r\n\r\nTo steer the tank at any speed, the driver had merely to raise the\r\nepicyclic gear lever on the side on which he wished to turn. This had\r\nthe effect of interrupting the drive to that track, so that, being\r\ndriven by the remaining track, the machine would turn upon the “idle”\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWhere a sharp “swing” was necessary, application of the foot brake\r\nwould automatically check the “idle” track, this being allowed for by\r\nmeans of a single compensating link motion with which the controls were\r\ninterconnected.\r\n\r\nThe engine was petrol-fed by the autovac system, as fitted to the\r\nlater Mark IV machines. Cooling of the engine was effected by means\r\nof a tubular type radiator, the water therein being itself cooled by\r\nair drawn from outside the tank, through louvres in the left-hand\r\nwall of the hull, and finally expelled through similar louvres in the\r\nright-hand wall.\r\n\r\nFurther, the engine was completely enclosed in a sheet-iron casing,\r\nfrom which the hot foul air was exhausted through the roof of the tank\r\nby means of a Keith fan.\r\n\r\nThe Mark V armament corresponded with that of the Mark IV, whilst the\r\nsponsons were of similar design to those fitted to the latter type.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the large differential gear, as fitted on the earlier\r\nmodels, gave accommodation for a machine-gun in the rear wall of the\r\ntank, and also allowed for large entrance doors in the back portion of\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\nA greatly improved type of rear cab was fitted, and thus provided\r\nexcellent all-round vision, and also rendered possible the fitting of\r\nthe unditching beam to the tracks from the inside of the machine. This\r\nwas accomplished through the side flaps of the rear cab of the Mark V,\r\nwhereas on previous models it had been necessary for members of the\r\ncrew to expose themselves to hostile fire, in the event of the tank\r\nbecoming ditched in action, as the beam could only be attached and\r\ndetached from outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF BRITISH TANKS USED DURING THE GREAT WAR\r\n\r\n

carry twenty men in addition to\r\n                 its crew.\r\n        (ii) The Gun-carrier could carry 10 tons weight of stores.\r\n       (iii) Radii of Action are only approximate; they depend on the\r\n                 nature of the ground, efficiency of the crew, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARK V ONE STAR TANK (Plate VII--see p. 220)\r\n\r\nThe Mark V star machine was 6 ft. longer than the Mark V, and the\r\nweight of the male, equipped, was approximately 33 tons. There was no\r\nchange in the nature of the armament, or in the number of the crew,\r\nwhich consisted of eight all told. In addition to the crew, the machine\r\nwas capable of carrying twenty to twenty-five other troops and would\r\ncross a 14 ft. trench, as against 10 ft. for the Mark V.\r\n\r\nThe general mechanical arrangement of this tank corresponded with that\r\nof the Mark V, the same engine and transmission system being adopted,\r\nwith the addition of a Cardan shaft between the flywheel and gear-box,\r\nwhich was rendered necessary by the additional length of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe Mark V star was relatively slow to manœuvre, owing chiefly to the\r\namount of track-bearing surface on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDIUM MARK A OR “WHIPPET” TANK\r\n\r\n(Plate III--see p. 176)\r\n\r\nThe Medium A tank, known also as the “Chaser” and “Whippet,” was the\r\nBritish standard light-type machine, and it differed altogether from\r\nits heavier relatives. Its weight, equipped, was about 14 tons, whilst\r\nit was 20 ft. long, 9 ft. high, and 8 ft. 7 in. wide, carrying a crew\r\nof three. It could attain a maximum speed of about 8·3 m.p.h., and\r\ncould span a trench approximately 7 ft. in width.\r\n\r\nOn this machine the tracks were not carried “overhead” as in the\r\ncase of the heavy tanks, but the two trackways existed as such only,\r\nand formed the road members of what may be described as the chassis\r\nupon which the engine-room and fighting cab were mounted. There were\r\nno sponsons, and the tank was driven and fought from the cab at the\r\nrear of the machine, provision being allowed for an armament of three\r\nmachine-guns.\r\n\r\nEach machine was fitted with two 45 h.p. 4-cylinder Tyler engines with\r\nan autovac petrol feed, and cooled by means of a tubular radiator\r\nprovided with two fans driven by chains from each crankshaft.\r\n\r\nThe power of each engine was transmitted through separate cone\r\nclutches, leather flexible couplings, and four-speed and reverse\r\ngear-boxes, to a casing, at the rear of the machine, containing two\r\nworm gears.\r\n\r\nThe two worm-wheel shafts of these gears were in line, with their inner\r\nends nearly touching, and each carrying the keyed-on half of a jawed\r\ncoupling, one of which could be slid along at will, to engage with the\r\nother, thus locking the two shafts together.\r\n\r\nOne of the shafts carried a friction-clutch arrangement, designed to\r\nlimit the power transmitted from one shaft to the other to about 12 h.p.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that either worm-wheel shaft could be\r\ndriven independently by its own engine, or the two could be locked\r\ntogether so as to rotate at the same speed, driving the tank straight\r\nahead, provided that there was not more than 12 h.p. difference between\r\nthe developed powers of the engines. Extensions of each worm shaft\r\ncarried a band brake, as well as a fan for forcing air into the cab of\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\nReturning to the details of the transmission system, each cross-shaft\r\nfrom the worm case terminated in a “driving chain pinion shaft,” the\r\nouter ends of which were supported by ball bearings mounted upon\r\nthe sides of the track frames. The chain pinion carried by this\r\nshaft transmitted the drive, through a roller chain, to the final\r\ntrack-driving wheels, which, engaging with the slots in the track\r\nlinks, drove the tank along the track. Each track consisted normally of\r\nsixty-seven plates or shoes, and rollers served to support the weight\r\nof the tank upon the track, as well as to carry the track over the top\r\nof the trackway. Adjustment of the track was effected by movement of\r\nthe front “idler” wheel as in the case of the heavier machines.\r\n\r\nThe Whippet tank called for particular skill in driving, and a great\r\ndeal of practice was usually necessary to produce a really efficient\r\ndriver. “Stalling” of one or both engines was a common occurrence\r\nduring the earlier stages of training. Steering was effected by varying\r\nthe speed of either engine, and the radius of movement was proportional\r\nto the difference in the speed of the two engines, this difference\r\nbeing controlled by means of a steering wheel connected to the two\r\ncarburetter throttles, movement of the wheel producing acceleration of\r\none engine and deceleration of the other simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUN-CARRYING TANK (Plate VII--see p. 220)\r\n\r\nOriginally designed for carrying a 60-pounder gun or 6-in. howitzer and\r\nammunition into action, these machines during 1918 were chiefly used\r\nfor the transport of supplies across country. The engine, a 6-cylinder\r\n105 h.p. Daimler, was placed right at the rear of the machine, and the\r\ngeneral lay-out of the transmission corresponded with that of the Mark\r\nIV modified to suit the engine position, the primary and secondary\r\ngears, etc., being mounted forward of the engine in the case of this\r\nG.C. tank. The final drive to the track was at the rear, and exactly\r\nfollowed the Mark IV practice, whilst the track itself was carried on\r\ntrack frames, in this respect somewhat resembling the Medium A machine.\r\n\r\nFour men were required to control the G.C. tank, the driver and\r\nbrakesman being separately housed in two small independent cabs mounted\r\none over each track towards the front of the machine, whilst the\r\nsecondary gearsmen travelled in the body of the machine.\r\n\r\nA system of signalling by signs from driver to other members of the\r\ncrew was adopted.\r\n\r\nSituated between the inner walls of the hull at the front of the tank\r\nwas a “skid” or platform which could be drawn out, and its front\r\nlowered to the ground, forming an inclined runway up which the gun was\r\nhauled, by means of a winding gear operated from the engine, to its\r\ntravelling position on the machine.\r\n\r\nDrums for carrying ammunition for the guns were supported on platforms\r\nover the tracks immediately in rear of the two control cabs.\r\n\r\nThe first G.C. tanks were fitted with “tails,” similar to those on the\r\nMark I machines, but these were later on discarded.\r\n\r\nThe above includes the brief mechanical summary of the various types of\r\nBritish tanks used during the Great War, and though, undoubtedly, the\r\nfuture will bring with it many improvements and may radically change\r\nthe whole form of the present-day tank, it is doubted if ever, in the\r\nwhole history of mechanics--let alone warfare, a novel machine has been\r\nproduced which has proved so efficient on first use and required in the\r\nlong run of two years of war so few changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MARK I TANK AND ITS TACTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mark I tank was the direct produce of the experimental machine\r\nwhich was officially tested on February 2, 1916. It may be defined as\r\n“a mechanically-propelled cross-country armoured battery,” the maximum\r\nthickness of its armour being 12 mm.[17]\r\n\r\nThe main tactical characteristics of all tanks may be placed under the\r\nheadings of--mobility, security, and offensive power, and as regards\r\nthe Mark I machine the following is a general description of these\r\ncharacteristics:\r\n\r\n(i) _Mobility._--The Mark I tank could move over flat ground at 100 to\r\n120 yards a minute, over ground intersected by trenches at 30 to 40\r\nyards a minute, and at night time at 15 yards a minute. It could cross\r\nall forms of wire entanglements, crushing down two paths through them\r\nwhich were passable by two single files of infantry. It could span a\r\ntrench 11 ft. 6 in. wide, surmount an obstacle 5 ft. high, and climb a\r\nslope of 1 over 2.\r\n\r\n(ii) _Security._--The Mark I tank was proof against ordinary bullets,\r\nshrapnel, and most shell-splinters.\r\n\r\n(iii) _Offensive Power._--Mark I tanks were divided into two\r\ncategories: male and female. The former carried an armament of two\r\n6-pounder guns and four Hotchkiss machine-guns, the latter of five\r\nVickers and one Hotchkiss machine-guns. The normal amount of ammunition\r\ncarried was for males 200 rounds and 10,000 rounds S.A.A., and for\r\nfemales 12,000 rounds S.A.A.\r\n\r\nThe chief limitations of the tank are connected with its mobility. For\r\nthe Mark I type these limitations were as follows:\r\n\r\nIts circuit in action was about 12 miles, and the fighting endurance\r\nof its crew 8 to 12 hours. It was not suited for traversing swamps,\r\nthick woods, streams with marshy banks, or deep sunken roads. It could\r\nbe expected to cross shelled dry ground at a slow pace, but should this\r\nground become sodden with rain it would find difficulty in doing so,\r\nand might frequently become ditched.\r\n\r\nA tactical paper on the employment of this machine was put forward\r\nofficially in February 1916 by Colonel Swinton, entitled “Notes on the\r\nEmployment of ‘Tanks.’” This document is of special interest as it is\r\nthe first tactical note published on the use of tanks. The following\r\nare certain extracts taken from it:\r\n\r\n  “The use made by the Germans of machine-guns and wire\r\n  entanglements--a combination which has such power to check the\r\n  advance of infantry--has in reply brought about the evolution of\r\n  the ‘caterpillar bullet-proof climbing motor, or tank,’ a machine\r\n  designed for the express purpose of assisting attacking infantry\r\n  by crossing the defences, breaking through the obstacles, and\r\n  of disposing of the machine-guns. It is primarily a machine-gun\r\n  destroyer, which can be employed as an auxiliary to an infantry\r\n  assault....”\r\n\r\n  “Hostile machine-guns which it is impossible to crush (_i.e._ by\r\n  running over them) will be attacked by gunfire. It is specially\r\n  for the purpose of dealing with these weapons ensconced in houses,\r\n  cellars, amongst ruins, in haystacks, or in other concealed\r\n  positions behind the enemy’s front line, where they may not\r\n  be knocked out by our artillery, and whence they can stop our\r\n  infantry advances, that the tanks carry guns. Being covered with\r\n  bullet-proof protection, and therefore to a great extent immune\r\n  from the hostile machine-guns, they can approach sufficiently close\r\n  to locate the latter, and pour in shell at point-blank range....”\r\n\r\n  “As ... it is proposed that the tanks should accompany the\r\n  infantry,” they should carry forward the following signalling\r\n  apparatus, “small wireless sets ... an apparatus for laying a field\r\n  telephone cable either on the surface of the ground or possibly\r\n  buried 12 in. deep ...” also visual signalling apparatus and smoke\r\n  rockets.\r\n\r\n  “The tanks will be destroyed by a direct hit of any type of\r\n  howitzer shell. They will probably be put out of action by all\r\n  except the most glancing hits of high-explosive shell fired by\r\n  field-guns.... They may also be blown up by mines or land-mines....”\r\n\r\n  “Since the chance of success of an attack by tanks lies almost\r\n  entirely in its novelty, and in the element of surprise, it is\r\n  obvious that no repetition of it will have the same opportunity of\r\n  succeeding as the first unexpected effort. It follows, therefore,\r\n  that these machines _should not be used in driblets_ (for instance,\r\n  as they may be produced), but that the fact of their existence\r\n  should be kept as secret as possible until the whole are ready\r\n  to be launched, together with the infantry assault, in one great\r\n  combined operation....”\r\n\r\n  “The sector of front where the machines can best operate should be\r\n  carefully chosen to comply with their limitations, _i.e._ their\r\n  inability to cross canals, rivers, deep railway cuttings with steep\r\n  sides, woods and orchards....”\r\n\r\n  Tanks should remain at the position of assembly “sufficiently long\r\n  for the crews to reconnoitre, ease and mark out the routes up to\r\n  the points where they will actually cross the front defences,\r\n  and to learn all that can be discovered of the German front-line\r\n  trenches, and the defence zone behind it over which they have to\r\n  advance....”\r\n\r\n  “The tanks, it is thought, should move forward together, say,\r\n  by rocket signal, sweeping the enemy’s first-line parapet with\r\n  machine-gun fire; and after they have proceeded some three-quarters\r\n  of the way across ‘No Man’s Land,’ and have succeeded in attracting\r\n  to themselves the fire of the German infantry and machine-guns in\r\n  the front line, the assaulting infantry should charge forward so as\r\n  to reach the German defences soon after the tanks have climbed the\r\n  parapet and begun to enfilade the trenches....”\r\n\r\n  “... unless expectations are falsified, if the machines accompany\r\n  the assaulting infantry, moving with it, or just ahead of it ...\r\n  both will be across the enemy’s front line and on their way to the\r\n  second before the curtain of fire descends, and the latter will be\r\n  behind them. It is hoped similarly that, owing to the prevention of\r\n  the usual checks to the advance, which the action of the tanks will\r\n  ensure, by the time the German gunners shorten the range in order\r\n  to provide a second curtain in front of their second line, our\r\n  assault will have already swept beyond the line.\r\n\r\n  “The above anticipations are admittedly sanguine; but if the\r\n  tanks are employed and are successful, it is thought that they\r\n  will enable the assault to maintain most of its starting momentum,\r\n  and _break through the German position quickly_,” a condition\r\n  which up to the present it has not been possible to attain, “even\r\n  after immense sacrifice of life.”... “Not only, however, does it\r\n  seem that the tanks will confer the power to force successive\r\n  comparatively unbattered defensive lines, but ... the more speedy\r\n  and uninterrupted their advance, the greater the chance of their\r\n  surviving sufficiently long to do this. It is possible, therefore,\r\n  that an effort to break right through the enemy’s defensive zone\r\n  in one day may now be contemplated as a feasible proposition....\r\n  This being the case, it appears that when the tanks are used the\r\n  contingency of such an extended bound forward being made should be\r\n  most carefully legislated for in the way of preparation to send\r\n  forward reinforcements, guns, ammunition, and supplies....”\r\n\r\n  “The necessity for the co-ordination of all arms to work together\r\n  in the offensive generally requires no remarks here, but the\r\n  desirability of the specially careful consideration of the subject\r\n  in the case of an operation by tanks, requires some emphasis,\r\n  since the orchestration of the attack will be complicated by the\r\n  introduction of a new instrument and one which somewhat alters\r\n  the chain of interdependence of all. A recapitulation of this\r\n  chain will make the matter clear. The tanks cannot win battles by\r\n  themselves. They are purely auxiliary to the infantry, and are\r\n  intended to sweep away the obstructions which have hitherto stopped\r\n  the advance of our infantry beyond the German first line, and\r\n  cannot with certainty be disposed of by shell fire. It follows,\r\n  therefore, that the progress of the attack, which depends on the\r\n  advance of the infantry, depends on the activity and preservation\r\n  in action of the tanks.\r\n\r\n  “The weapons by which the tanks are most likely to be put out of\r\n  action are the enemy guns. The only means by which we can at the\r\n  earlier stages of an attack reduce the activity of the enemy’s\r\n  guns, are by our own artillery fire or by dropping bombs on them\r\n  from the air.\r\n\r\n  “It follows, therefore, that in order to help our infantry in any\r\n  operation in which tanks take part ... the principal object of our\r\n  guns should not be to endeavour to damage the German machine-guns,\r\n  earthworks, and wire, behind the enemy’s first line, a task\r\n  they cannot with certainty carry out, and which the tanks are\r\n  specially designed to perform. It should be to endeavour to help\r\n  the infantry by helping the tanks, _i.e._ by concentrating as heavy\r\n  a counter-fire as possible on the enemy’s main artillery position,\r\n  and on any field or other light guns whose situation behind the\r\n  first line is known....”\r\n\r\n  “In order to increase the confusion which it is hoped will be\r\n  caused amongst the enemy by an attack by tanks, and to assist in\r\n  concealing the exact nature and the progress of these machines, it\r\n  would be of advantage if their advance were heralded by clouds of\r\n  smoke....”\r\n\r\nThe above quotations need no comment, and if comment is to be sought\r\nfor, the most suitable places to seek it are the battles in which tanks\r\neventually took part, for in these, and the great number of lesser\r\nactions, some eighty-five in all, it will be found that not only were\r\nColonel Swinton’s speculations, made seven months before the first tank\r\ncrossed “No Man’s Land,” not mere “flights of imagination,” but “solid\r\nfacts,” the value of which these battles have proved again and again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLES OF THE SOMME AND ANCRE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1916, the battle of the Somme opened with a successful\r\nadvance on the British right between Maricourt and Ovillers, and a\r\ncheck on the British left between Ovillers and Gommecourt. From that\r\nday on to the commencement of the battle of the Ancre, in November,\r\nno further attempt was made to push forward the British left, all\r\navailable troops being required to maintain the forward movement of the\r\nright flank.\r\n\r\nThe ground which separates the rivers Somme and Ancre is split up\r\ninto valleys by pronounced ridges, most of which form natural lines\r\nof defence for an enemy and could, in 1916, only be stormed after\r\nhaving been subjected to a heavy artillery bombardment. The ground had\r\nconsequently become severely “crumped” in places; but as the weather,\r\nup to September 15, had been fine and dry, it offered no insuperable\r\ndifficulty to the movement of the tanks, which were allotted to the\r\nFourth and Reserve Armies as follows:\r\n\r\n  Fourth Army, XIVth Corps   “C” Company (less 1 Section)    17 tanks\r\n    „     „    XVth    „     “D” Company (less 1 Section)    17   „\r\n    „     „    IIIrd   „     1 Section “D” Company            8   „\r\n  Reserve Army               1 Section “C” Company            7   „\r\n  In G.H.Q. Reserve (all mechanically unfit)                 10   „\r\n\r\nOn September 11 operation orders were received from the Fourth Army,\r\nand on the 13th a conference was held, at which Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nBradley attended, to discuss the forthcoming attack. During the 14th\r\n“A” Company arrived at Yvrench, and at 4.30 p.m. on that day the\r\nheadquarters of “C” Company moved to the Briquetterie near Trones\r\nWood, and the headquarters of “D” Company to Green Dump.\r\n\r\nThe frontage of the Fourth Army attack extended between the Combles\r\nravine and Martinpuich, the intention being to break through the\r\nenemy’s defensive system and occupy Morval, Les Bœufs, Gueudecourt,\r\nand Flers. Simultaneously with this attack the Reserve Army was to\r\nattack on the left of the IIIrd Corps, and the French on the right\r\nof the XIVth Corps. The attack was to be pushed with the utmost\r\nvigour, and was to be followed by the advance of the Cavalry Corps,\r\nwhich was to seize the high ground about Rocquigny-Villers au\r\nFlos-Riencourt-lez-Bapaume.\r\n\r\nThe general idea governing tank movements, on this the first occasion\r\nof their use, was that they should be employed in sub-sections of two\r\nor three machines against “strong points.” Considerable apprehension\r\nexisted as to the likelihood on the one hand of tanks, if they started\r\ntoo soon, drawing prematurely the enemy’s fire, and on the other of\r\ntheir reaching their objective too late to be an assistance to the\r\ninfantry. It was finally decided that they should start in sufficient\r\ntime to reach the first objective five minutes before the infantry got\r\nthere, and thus risk drawing hostile fire. Our own artillery barrages,\r\nstationary and creeping, were to be brought down at zero, leaving lanes\r\nfree from fire through which the tanks were to advance.\r\n\r\nThe tanks moved up from their positions of assembly to their\r\nstarting-points during the night of September 14-15. Of the\r\nforty-nine machines allotted for the attack, thirty-two reached their\r\nstarting-points in time for the battle, the remainder failing to\r\narrive through becoming ditched on the way, or breaking down through\r\nmechanical trouble.\r\n\r\nThe tanks working with the Reserve Army and the IIIrd and XIVth Corps\r\nwere not a great success; the operations of those with the XVth Corps\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\nThe tanks allotted to this Corps assembled on the night of September\r\n13-14 at the Green Dump, where the machines were tuned up for battle,\r\nand where stores of petrol and oil had been collected. On the night of\r\nthe 14-15th the tanks moved up to their starting-points round Delville\r\nWood. Every tank was given the route it had to follow, and the time it\r\nwas to leave the starting-point; this was in most cases about half an\r\nhour before zero (dawn), and was intended to be arranged so that the\r\ntanks should reach the German trenches a few minutes ahead of our own\r\ninfantry. Briefly, the orders were for eight tanks to advance on the\r\nwest of Flers, and six on the east of that village, their destination\r\nbeing Gueudecourt and the sunken road to the west of it. The tanks were\r\nto attack all strong points on their routes, and to assist the infantry\r\nwhenever held up.\r\n\r\nOf the seventeen tanks which moved off, twelve reached their\r\nstarting-points; eleven of these crossed the German trenches and\r\ndid useful work. One in particular gave great assistance where the\r\nattacking infantry were held up in front of the Flers line by wire\r\nand machine-gun fire; the tank commander placed his machine astride\r\nthe trench and enfiladed it; the tank then travelled along behind the\r\ntrench, and 300 Germans surrendered and were taken prisoners. Another\r\ntank entered Gueudecourt, attacked a German battery and destroyed one\r\n77 mm. field-gun with its 6-pounders; the tank was then hit by a shell\r\nand caught fire; only two of its crew got back to our lines.\r\n\r\nThis attack on September 15, from the point of view of tank operations,\r\nwas not a great success. Of the forty-nine tanks employed, only\r\nthirty-two reached their starting-points; nine pushed ahead of the\r\ninfantry and caused considerable loss to the enemy, and nine others,\r\nthough they never caught up with the infantry, did good work in\r\nclearing up points where the enemy was still holding out. Of the\r\nremaining fourteen, nine broke down from mechanical trouble, and five\r\nbecame ditched.\r\n\r\nThe casualties amongst the tank personnel were insignificant. Of the\r\nmachines ten were hit in action and temporarily rendered useless, and\r\nseven were slightly damaged, but not sufficiently so as to prevent them\r\nreturning in safety.\r\n\r\nThe next occasion upon which tanks were used was during the attacks of\r\nSeptember 25 and 26, five being allotted to the Fourth Army, and eight\r\nto the Reserve Army. Of these thirteen tanks nine stuck in shell-holes,\r\ntwo worked their way into Thiepval, and after rendering assistance to\r\nthe infantry met a similar fate, and one, working with the XVth Corps,\r\ncarried out the first “star” turn in the history of tank tactics, which\r\nin the report of the XVth Corps is described as follows:\r\n\r\n  “On September 25, the 64th Brigade, 21st Division, attack on Gird\r\n  trench was hung up and unable to make any progress. A footing had\r\n  been obtained in Gird trench at N.32 d.9.1,[18] and our troops\r\n  held the trench from N.26 c.4.5, northwards. Between these two\r\n  points there remained approximately 1,500 yards of trench, very\r\n  strongly held by Germans, well wired, the wire not having been cut.\r\n  Arrangements were made for a tank (female) to move up from here for\r\n  an attack next morning. The tank arrived at 6.30 a.m. followed by\r\n  bombers. It started moving south-eastwards along the Gird trench,\r\n  firing its machine-guns. As the trench gradually fell into our\r\n  hands, strong points were made in it by two companies of infantry,\r\n  which were following in the rear for that purpose. No difficulty\r\n  was experienced. The enemy surrendered freely as the tank moved\r\n  down the trench. They were unable to escape owing to our holding\r\n  the trench at the southern end at N.32 d.9.1. By 8.30 a.m. the\r\n  whole length of the trench had been cleared, and the 15th Durham\r\n  Light Infantry moved over the open and took over the captured\r\n  trench. The infantry then advanced to their final objective, when\r\n  the tank rendered very valuable assistance. The tank finally ran\r\n  short of petrol south-east of Gueudecourt. In the capture of\r\n  the Gird trench, eight officers and 362 other ranks were made\r\n  prisoners, and a great many Germans were killed. Our casualties\r\n  only amounted to five. Nearly 1,500 yards of trench were captured\r\n  in less than an hour. What would have proved a very difficult\r\n  operation, involving probably heavy losses, was taken with greatest\r\n  ease entirely owing to the assistance rendered by the tank.”\r\n\r\nThe last occasion upon which tanks were used during 1916 was on\r\nNovember 13 and 14, in the battle of the Ancre, which completed the\r\nSomme operations for the year. Heavy rain had fallen, and the difficult\r\nground along the river Ancre had been converted into a morass of mud.\r\nFor this attack complete tank preparations were made, reconnaissances\r\nwere carried out, and a tankodrome (Tank Park) was established at\r\nAcheux.\r\n\r\nOn account of the bad weather the original plan, namely, to use twenty\r\ntanks, was abandoned, and a much more modest scheme was evolved. Three\r\ntanks were to operate with the 39th Division opposite St. Pierre\r\nDivion. On November 13 these moved forward, and eventually all three\r\nstuck in the mud. North of the river Ancre two tanks were sent against\r\nBeaumont Hamel; these also became ditched. Next morning three more\r\ntanks were sent out to clear up a strong point just south of the\r\nlast-named village. One of these was hit by a shell, and the remaining\r\ntwo, on reaching the German front line, became ditched. These two tanks\r\nwere, however, able to bring their 6-pounders and machine-guns to bear\r\non the strong point, and their fire proved so effective that after a\r\nshort time the Germans holding it surrendered, and 400 prisoners were\r\nrounded up by the tank crews--2 officers and 14 other ranks.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the general observer it might be said that,\r\nexcept for one or two small and brilliant operations, the tank during\r\nthe battle of the Somme had not proved its value. The general observer,\r\nhowever, is seldom the best judge, and when the actual conditions under\r\nwhich tanks were used, during the autumn of 1916, are weighed and the\r\nlessons sorted, history’s verdict, it is thought, will be, that they\r\nhad so far proved their value that September 15, 1916, will in future\r\nbe noted not so much for the successes gained on that day, but as the\r\nbirthday of a new epoch in the history of war.\r\n\r\nWhat were these lessons?\r\n\r\n(i) That the machine in principle was absolutely sound, and that all it\r\nrequired were certain mechanical improvements.\r\n\r\n(ii) That it had not been given a fair trial. It had been constructed\r\nfor good going and fine weather; it had been, unavoidably, used on\r\npulverised soil, often converted by rain into a pudding of mud.\r\n\r\n(iii) That, on account of the secrecy it was necessary to maintain,\r\ncommanders had little or no conception of the tactics to apply to its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n(iv) That sufficient time had not been obtainable wherein to give the\r\ncrews a thorough and careful training.\r\n\r\n(v) That tank operations require the most careful preparation and\r\nminute reconnaissances in order to render them successful.\r\n\r\n(vi) That tanks require leading and controlling in battle, and\r\nconsequently that a complete system of communication is essential.\r\n\r\n(vii) That tanks, like every other arm, require a separate supply\r\norganisation to maintain them whilst fighting.\r\n\r\n(viii) That tanks draw away much fire from the infantry, and have\r\nas great an encouraging effect on our own troops as they have a\r\ndemoralising one on the enemy’s.\r\n\r\nThese are the main lessons which were learnt from the tank operations\r\nwhich took place during the battles of the Somme and the Ancre, and\r\nthe mere fact of having learnt them justifies the employment of tanks\r\nduring these operations. Further it must be remembered that, whatever\r\ntests are carried out under peace conditions, the only true test of\r\nefficiency is war, consequently the final test a machine or weapon\r\nshould get is its first battle, and until this test has been undergone,\r\nno guarantee can be given of its real worth, and no certain deductions\r\ncan be made as to its future improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF THE TANK CORPS ORGANISATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word “Reorganisation” is a word which will never be forgotten by\r\nany member of the Tank Corps Headquarters Staff; it was their one\r\npersistent companion for over two years. It dogged their steps through\r\nall seasons, over training areas and battlefields in sleuth-hound\r\nfashion from the earliest days; and its pace was never stronger or its\r\ntongue more noisy than when, on November 11, 1918, it was temporarily\r\nshaken off with the armistice. Depressing as this perpetual change\r\noften was, reorganisation is, nevertheless, an extremely healthy sign,\r\nfor it shows that the Tank Corps, a young formation, was not afraid to\r\ngrow, and that it refused to stand still; and, when all is said and\r\ndone, should not every organisation be dynamic, should not it move with\r\nthe times, expand, grow, and absorb difficulties rather than push them\r\naside or ignore them? Whatever, in the eyes of others, the Tank Corps\r\nmay have been, throughout the Great War it was an intensely virile\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter the organisation and reorganisation of the Tank Corps,\r\nfirst known as the “Heavy Section,” and later as the “Heavy Branch” of\r\nthe Machine Gun Corps, will be dealt with in its entirety; for unless\r\nwe lay this spectre in a chapter of its own it will never leave us in\r\npeace, but will haunt our steps right through this brief history, as\r\nwas its wont when the incidents now related were taking form in France\r\nand England.\r\n\r\nIn June 1916 the Heavy Section Machine Gun Corps was organised in\r\nsix companies--A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each company consisted of four\r\nsections, each of six tanks with one spare tank per company--in all\r\ntwenty-five machines, thus absorbing the 150 machines ordered.[19]\r\nEach section consisted of 3 male and 3 female tanks, subdivided into\r\nthree sub-sections of 1 male and 1 female each.\r\n\r\nThe crew of a tank was 1 officer and 7 other ranks, the total personnel\r\nof a section being 6 officers and 43 other ranks. For every two\r\ncompanies was provided a Quartermaster’s establishment of 1 officer and\r\n4 other ranks, and a workshop of 3 officers and 50 other ranks.\r\n\r\nA few days after the Heavy Section had made its debut on the\r\nbattlefield of the Somme, a suggestion was put forward to organise\r\nit on the lines of the Royal Flying Corps, which, eventually, in the\r\nmain was adopted. This was undoubtedly a sound suggestion, as every\r\nnew weapon requires an organisation of its own to nurse it through its\r\ninfancy.\r\n\r\nOn September 29, Lieutenant-Colonel H. J. Elles, D.S.O., who, as we\r\nhave seen, first came into contact with tanks in January 1916, was\r\nappointed Colonel Commanding the Heavy Section in France, and on the\r\nsame day that his appointment was sanctioned it was decided that 1,000\r\ntanks should be built, and that certain improvements in the existing\r\ndesign of machine should be introduced. At this time the Headquarters\r\nof the Heavy Section were located in one small hut in the centre of\r\nthe square of the village of Beauquesne, and as this village was not\r\nconsidered suitable for a permanent Headquarters, Bermicourt was\r\nselected instead--a small village just north of the Hesdin-St.-Pol\r\nroad. At this village the Headquarters remained until the end of the\r\nwar, expanding from three Nissen huts to many acres of buildings.\r\n\r\nOn October 8 a provisional establishment for the Headquarters was\r\napproved. It consisted of--a Commander (Colonel), one Brigade Major,\r\none D.A.A. and Q.M.G., one Staff Captain, and one Intelligence Officer.\r\nThese appointments were filled by the following officers: Colonel H. J.\r\nElles, Captain G. le Q. Martel, Captain T. J. Uzielli, Captain H. J.\r\nTapper, and Captain F. E. Hotblack.\r\n\r\nAt about this time it was proposed to form the Heavy Section into\r\na Corps, giving it an Administrative Headquarters in England and a\r\nFighting Headquarters in France, and of converting the four companies\r\nin France into four battalions, and raising five new battalions in\r\nEngland on the nuclei of the two remaining companies. Though the\r\nformation of the tank units into a Corps was not sanctioned at the time\r\nthe other proposals came into force on October 20, Brigadier-General\r\nF. Gore Anley, D.S.O., being appointed Administrative Commander of the\r\nTank Training Centre, Bovington Camp, Wool, in the place of Colonel\r\nSwinton, with Lieutenant-Colonel E. B. Mathew-Lannowe as his G.S.O.1.\r\nUnder this organisation the 9 battalions were eventually to be formed\r\ninto 3 brigades each of 3 battalions, a battalion consisting of 3\r\ncompanies, each company of 4 fighting sections and a headquarters\r\nsection. A fighting section consisted of 5 tanks and the headquarters\r\nsection of 8. In all the battalion was, therefore, equipped with 72\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nOn November 18, the day on which the approved establishments were\r\nissued, the companies, which had continued in the area of operations,\r\nwere moved to the area round Bermicourt and, ceasing to exist as\r\ncompanies, became A, B, C, and D Battalions Heavy Branch Machine Gun\r\nCorps. They were located at the following villages:\r\n\r\n  A Battalion        Humières, Eclimeux, Bermicourt.\r\n  B     „            Sautrecourt, Pierremont, St. Martin-Eglise.\r\n  C     „            Erin, Tilly-Capelle.\r\n  D     „            Blangy.\r\n\r\nThese battalions were eventually formed into the 1st and 2nd Tank\r\nBrigades: the 1st Brigade, consisting of C and D Battalions, on January\r\n30, 1917, under the command of Colonel C. D’A. B. S. Baker Carr,\r\nD.S.O.; and the 2nd Brigade, of A and B Battalions, on February 15,\r\nunder that of Colonel A. Courage, M.C. Later, on April 27, in view of\r\nthe expected arrival of two battalions from Wool, approval was given\r\nto the formation of the 3rd Brigade Headquarters under the command of\r\nColonel J. Hardress Lloyd, D.S.O.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in England, the whole question of future production was\r\nbeing strenuously dealt with by Lieutenant-Colonel Stern, who, on\r\nNovember 23, assembled a conference in London at which the future\r\nproduction of tanks was explained as follows:\r\n\r\nThat at the time of the conference there were 70 Mark I machines in\r\nFrance, and it was hoped to deliver improved types of this tank as\r\nfollows: 50 Mark II tanks by January; 50 Mark III tanks by February 7;\r\nMark IV tanks at the rate of 20 per week from February 7 to May 31.\r\nFurther, that Mark V tanks would be available in August and September\r\n1917, and that a new light tank, called Mark VI, would be ready for\r\ntrial by Christmas 1917.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, on account of the difficulty of production and the\r\nconstant changes demanded in design, the above programme never\r\nmaterialised, and though Mark II tanks were sent out to France, no Mark\r\nIV machines arrived there until after the battle of Arras had been\r\nfought and won.\r\n\r\nEarly in the new year the battalions of the Heavy Branch underwent a\r\nfurther reorganisation: they were slightly reduced in size and the\r\nnumber of their machines was cut down from 72 to 60; each company,\r\ntheoretically consisting of 20 tanks, was divided into 4 sections of\r\n5 tanks each; for practical purposes, however, it was found that a\r\nsection could not deal with more than 4 tanks, so the number of tanks\r\nwas reduced to 48, of which 36 were earmarked as fighting and 12 as\r\ntraining machines.\r\n\r\nIn March 1917 General Anley was appointed Administrative Commander\r\nHeavy Branch Machine-Gun Corps with his headquarters in London,\r\nBrigadier-General W. Glasgow taking over the command of the Training\r\nCentre at Wool. In May he was succeeded by Major-General Sir John\r\nCapper, K.C.B., and the Tank Committee under his chairmanship was\r\nformed to systematise and strengthen co-operation between the Army and\r\nthe Ministry of Munitions. On the 1st of this month, Colonel Elles was\r\ngazetted Brigadier-General Commanding the Heavy Branch in France.\r\n\r\nThe experiences gained during the battle of Arras, in April 1917,\r\nresulted in proposals being put forward for the expansion of the Heavy\r\nBranch from nine to eighteen battalions, nine to be equipped with\r\nheavy, and a similar number with medium machines.[20] These proposals\r\nmark an important stage in the development of the Heavy Branch and they\r\nwere destined to be the subject of many discussions.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, the above expansion was authorised, and the personnel for\r\nnew units was assembled at the Training Centre at Wool. A month later,\r\nhowever, the call for manpower became so urgent that the expansion of\r\nthe Heavy Branch had to be suspended. It was on the 28th of this month\r\nthat the Heavy Branch became known as the Tank Corps.\r\n\r\nDuring the following months, August and September, the question of\r\nthe Tank Corps expansion was held in abeyance. On October 6 it was\r\nonce again revived, and a revised establishment for the contemplated\r\nexpansion to eighteen battalions was submitted. The outstanding feature\r\nof these establishments was the abolition of Battalion Workshops and\r\nthe substitution of Brigade Workshops in their place. This resulted in\r\na considerable economy of man-power, and was rendered possible by the\r\nhigher training of the tank crews; each tank with its crew thus tended\r\nto become a self-contained unit.\r\n\r\nOn November 27 these establishments received official approval, and\r\nexactly one week later, on December 4, arising out of the overwhelming\r\nsuccess gained by tanks at the battle of Cambrai (November 20), two\r\nnew organisations were put forward, the first known as the Lower, and\r\nthe second as the Higher Establishments. The Lower Establishments were\r\neventually decided upon, and they consisted in a revised edition of the\r\nformer establishments with various additions, which the experiences\r\ngained at the battle of Cambrai had shown to be necessary. These\r\nestablishments, though made out, were never approved, and the German\r\noffensive in March 1918 found the Tank Corps still organised on the\r\nlines agreed upon in October.\r\n\r\nIn April, on account of the pressing needs for infantry reinforcements,\r\nthe Tank Corps expansion was temporarily suspended, two of the three\r\nremaining battalions in England being reduced to cadre units, and the\r\nthird converted into an Armoured Car Battalion. In July and August the\r\nastonishing successes gained by tanks on various sectors of the Western\r\nFront once again brought forward the need of increasing the British\r\ntank battalions, and the suspension was removed, the two remaining\r\nbattalions of the expansion of October 1917 proceeding to France in\r\nSeptember 1918.\r\n\r\nIn January 1918, from the experience gained by now in the time\r\nnecessary to carry through a reorganisation, proposals were put\r\nforward for 1919. These were eventually discussed at the Inter-Allied\r\nTank Committee, an assembly of representatives of the various allied\r\nTank Corps, which first met at Versailles in April. The German spring\r\noffensive, however, absorbed so much attention that it was not\r\npossible at the time to do more than work out, as a basis, the number\r\nof tanks required for a decisive tank attack the following year. As\r\nthe position of the Allies in France stabilised the question first\r\ndiscussed at Versailles was in July retaken up, with the result that\r\nan expansion to thirty-four battalions was decided on and completely\r\nnew establishments called for. In order to bring this work more\r\nclosely under the War Office it was also decided, at about this time,\r\nto dissolve the Tank Directorate, first created in May 1917, and to\r\nreplace it by a new sub-branch of the Directorate of Staff Duties. This\r\nchange took place on August 1, when a new branch known as S.D.7 was\r\nadded to the Directorate of Staff Duties at the War Office to deal with\r\nthe administration of tanks generally, and the 1919 tank programme in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Tank Committee was abolished, its place being\r\ntaken by the Tank Board, which was constituted as follows:\r\n\r\n  Major-General the Right Honourable J. E. B. Seely, C.B., C.M.G.,\r\n    D.S.O., M.P., President (Deputy Minister of Munitions).\r\n\r\n  Sir Eustace Tennyson D’Eyncourt, K.C.B., Vice-President (Director\r\n    of Naval Construction).\r\n\r\n  Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, K.C.B., K.C.V.O., D.S.O. (Controller\r\n    Munitions Inventions).\r\n\r\n  Major-General Sir William Furse, K.C.B., D.S.O. (Master General of\r\n    Ordnance, representing the Army Council).\r\n\r\n  Major-General E. D. Swinton, C.B., D.S.O.\r\n\r\n  Major-General H. J. Elles, C.B., D.S.O. (Commanding Tank Corps,\r\n    France).\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Albert Stern, K.B.E., C.M.G. (Commissioner\r\n    Mechanical Warfare, Overseas and Allies Department).\r\n\r\n  Colonel J. F. C. Fuller, D.S.O. (D.D.S.D. Tanks: representing\r\n    General Staff, War Office).\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. B. Maclean (Controller of Mechanical Warfare).\r\n\r\n  Sir Percival Perry (Inspector of Mechanical Traction).\r\n\r\n  Captain A. Earle, Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the Board is interesting as it enabled expert\r\nnaval, military, and industrial knowledge to be concentrated on the\r\none subject--the application of naval tactics to land warfare. The\r\nwork accomplished by this Board was considerable, it was carried out\r\nin a high co-operative spirit and with great good-fellowship, and\r\nit would, undoubtedly, have proved a factor of no small importance\r\nin the complete destruction of the German armies in 1919, which was\r\npractically fore-ordained by a tank programme of some 6,000 machines,\r\nhad the war continued.\r\n\r\nSeptember was a month of great activity at the Training Centre at Wool,\r\nand an extensive building programme was commenced under the direction\r\nof Brigadier-General E. B. Mathew-Lannowe, D.S.O., who had taken over\r\nthe command of the Training Centre on August 1 from Brigadier-General\r\nW. Glasgow, C.M.G.\r\n\r\nOn October 22 the new establishments were received at the War\r\nOffice, and were approved of and returned to G.H.Q. four days later.\r\nConsidering that these establishments covered ninety-six pages of typed\r\nfoolscap it may be claimed that the last reorganisation the Tank Corps\r\nexperienced during the Great War was carried through in record time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTANK “ESPRIT DE CORPS”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first “Instructions on Training” were issued to battalions of\r\nthe Heavy Branch towards the end of December 1916. They are of some\r\ninterest, as the _esprit de corps_ and the efficiency of the entire\r\nformation was by degrees moulded on them.\r\n\r\n  “The object of all training is to create a ‘corps d’élite,’ that\r\n  is a body of men who are not only capable of helping to win this\r\n  war, but are determined to do so. It cannot be emphasised too often\r\n  that all training, at all times and in all places, must aim at the\r\n  cultivation of the offensive spirit in all ranks. The requirements,\r\n  therefore, are a high efficiency and a high moral.\r\n\r\n  “Efficiency depends on mental alertness and bodily fitness; the\r\n  first is produced by extensive knowledge and rapidity of thinking\r\n  logically, the second by physical training, games, and the\r\n  maintenance of health.\r\n\r\n  “Moral depends on _esprit de corps_ and _esprit de cocarde_; the\r\n  first is produced by discipline, organisation and skill, the second\r\n  by pride, smartness and prestige.\r\n\r\n  “Efficient instructors and leaders are essential; indifferent ones\r\n  must be ruthlessly weeded out. Officers must not content themselves\r\n  with the teaching and knowledge they gain, but must supplement\r\n  these by personal study and effort. Further, they must exercise\r\n  their ingenuity in adapting the knowledge they have gained so that\r\n  it may interest and expand the ideas of those they teach. In mental\r\n  superiority and bodily vigour they must be examples to their men.\r\n\r\n  “As a general principle, officers and N.C.O.s, charged with the\r\n  duty of instruction of troops, should adopt the following method:\r\n  First the lesson is to be explained, secondly demonstrated, and\r\n  finally carried out as an exercise.\r\n\r\n  “Instruction _must_ be interesting. As interest soon flags,\r\n  subjects will be changed at short intervals, though the same\r\n  movements must be frequently practised on different occasions.\r\n\r\n  “Changes should be based on a system; thus, work which has\r\n  required brain power should be followed by work entailing physical\r\n  exertion, and _vice versa_. As physical training develops muscle\r\n  on a definite system, so should mental training develop mind. It\r\n  will not be easy to accomplish this unless schemes are carefully\r\n  organised and thought out, and training is carried out according to\r\n  a progressive programme.\r\n\r\n  “Much time is often wasted by attempting long unrealistic movements\r\n  and by prolonged drill. Three to four hours a day, divided into\r\n  hourly or half-hourly periods, should be sufficient. Ten minutes’\r\n  rest intervals should succeed each hour’s work.\r\n\r\n  “All work must be carried out at high pressure. Every exercise and\r\n  movement should, if possible, be reduced to a precise drill.\r\n\r\n  “Games will be organised as a definite part of training.\r\n\r\n  “Order is best cultivated by carrying out all work on a fixed plan.\r\n  Order is the foundation of discipline. Small things like marching\r\n  men always at attention to and from work, making them stand to\r\n  attention before dismissing them, assist in cultivating steadiness\r\n  and discipline. Each day should commence with a careful inspection\r\n  of the billets and the men, or some similar formal parade. Strict\r\n  march discipline to and from the training grounds must be insisted\r\n  upon.\r\n\r\n  “It is an essential part of training for war that the men are\r\n  taught to care for themselves, so as to maintain their physical\r\n  fitness. To this end the necessity for taking the most scrupulous\r\n  care of their clothing, equipment and accoutrements will be\r\n  explained to them.\r\n\r\n  “The importance of obedience to orders will be impressed on all\r\n  ranks and prevention of waste rigorously enforced.\r\n\r\n  “Both in the case of officers and N.C.O.s special attention should\r\n  be paid to the training of understudies for all positions and\r\n  appointments.\r\n\r\n  “The men must be brought to understand that on the skill they gain\r\n  during training will depend their lives as well as the result\r\n  of the battle. Instruction is not a matter of getting through a\r\n  definite time, but of employing that time to the fullest advantage.”\r\n\r\nThe training of the Heavy Branch was divided into the following\r\ncategories: Brigade Training, Battalion Training, Schools, Courses of\r\nInstruction, Camps of Instruction, Lectures and Depot Training.\r\n\r\nBrigade and battalion training were divided into two\r\nperiods--individual training and collective training. As time was very\r\nlimited, all individual training had to be completed by February 15,\r\n1917.\r\n\r\n  “The object of individual training” (to quote the “Instructions”)\r\n  “is twofold: first, to impart technical knowledge and skill;\r\n  secondly, to cultivate general knowledge so as to enable all ranks\r\n  to obtain the highest benefit from the schemes set in collective\r\n  training. These latter in their turn are for the purpose of\r\n  training units for battle. Individual training is the keynote of\r\n  efficiency. On the thoroughness with which it is carried out rests\r\n  the efficiency of the whole training.”\r\n\r\nThe object of the collective training was:\r\n\r\n  “To apply, in conditions as near as possible to those which will be\r\n  met with in battle, the detail learnt during individual training.\r\n\r\n  “This comprises:\r\n\r\n  “(i) Close co-operation with the other arms.\r\n\r\n  “(ii) Rapidity of movement across ground in fighting formations.\r\n\r\n  “(iii) Selection of objectives with reference to the plan of\r\n  operations.”\r\n\r\nDuring January and February all officers took part in a long indoor\r\nscheme which when completed formed a tactical and administrative basis\r\nfor future operations, and all ranks were lectured to on discipline,\r\n_esprit de corps_, moral, and leadership.\r\n\r\nWhilst the above work was in progress a Reinforcement Depot was formed,\r\nfirst at Humerœuil, later on it was moved to Erin, and eventually to\r\nMers, near Le Treport. The Depot was the receiving station of all\r\ndrafts arriving for the Tank Corps, whether from the Training Centre in\r\nEngland, or from units or hospitals in France. The duty of the Depot\r\nwas to hold on its strength all reinforcements until fully trained,\r\nand when fully trained to continue refresher training until they were\r\nrequired to fill vacancies in the battalions.\r\n\r\nBesides the Depot and the schools attached to it, two main\r\nschools--Gunnery and Tank Driving--were instituted in the Bermicourt\r\narea. In the early summer of 1917 the first was moved to the sea\r\ncoast at Merlimont, and the second to Wailly, a village close to the\r\nzone devastated by the Germans during their retreat in the preceding\r\nFebruary and March, which permitted of driving being carried out\r\nwithout damage to crops. This school remained at Wailly until January\r\n1918, when, on account of the threatening German attack, it was moved\r\nto Aveluy near Albert. As it happened, Aveluy fell into the German\r\nhands towards the end of March 1918, whilst Wailly remained in ours\r\nuntil the end of the war.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the training of the men was the general\r\nadministration of the Heavy Branch. It was fully recognised that the\r\nefficiency of all ranks depended to a great extent on the cheerfulness\r\nand comfort of their surroundings, and nothing was left undone, or at\r\nleast unattempted, which could increase the men’s happiness and health.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1917, baths and laundries were opened at Blangy. The\r\narrangements first made enabled 450 men to bathe each day; this\r\npermitted of every man getting a bath once a week. Cinema theatres were\r\nalso established at the Depot, and later on at Merlimont and elsewhere,\r\nbeing bought out of funds provided by the canteens’ and supper bars.\r\nWhile at Erin a Rest Camp was formed to which those men who were\r\ntemporarily incapacitated for work were sent to recuperate. This later\r\ninstitution was found so useful that in the summer of 1917 a seaside\r\nRest Camp was established at Merlimont, the object of which was to\r\nprovide rest and change of surroundings to men who had been in action,\r\nor whose health was impaired. This camp could accommodate 100 officers\r\nand 900 other ranks, and the period of rest there was usually limited\r\nto fourteen days.\r\n\r\nAn even more popular institution than the Merlimont Rest Camp was that\r\nof the Mobile Canteens: these consisted in lorries fitted to carry\r\ncanteen stores; they formed the mechanical _vivandières_ of the Tank\r\nCorps, following up units to within a mile or two of our front lines\r\nor pushing forward across the battlefield when a success had been\r\ngained. During the dark days of March and April 1918, they played a\r\nnotable part in maintaining the _esprit de corps_ of the battalions by\r\nproviding comforts which would otherwise have been unobtainable. They\r\nalso formed cheerful rallying-points where men could meet, eat, and\r\nchat, and then return to battle refreshed and still more determined to\r\nsee it through for the honour of the Corps to which they belonged and\r\nwhich, it may without boasting be said, always thought of their needs\r\nfirst and generally supplied them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTANK TACTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe training of the Heavy Branch having been laid down, it was next\r\nnecessary to discover and decide upon a common method of tactics,[21]\r\nso that directly individual instruction had been completed collective\r\ntraining might be based on it; further, rumours were already afloat\r\nthat the Heavy Branch might be called upon to take part in the spring\r\noffensive, so there was no time to be lost in deciding upon suitable\r\nmethods and formations of attack. This was done early in February, when\r\n“Training Note No. 16,” which will long be remembered by many in the\r\nTank Corps, was issued.\r\n\r\nThough experience is the only true test of a system of tactics, the\r\nfoundations of the tactics suitable to any particular weapon are not\r\nbased on experiences, but on the limitations of the weapon, that is\r\non its powers, and on the fundamental principles of war. Further\r\nthan this, if the weapon concerned is to be employed in co-operation\r\nwith other weapons, the powers of these other weapons must also be\r\nconsidered, so that all the weapons to be employed may, so to speak,\r\nlike a puzzle, be fitted together during battle to form one united\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nIn thinking out a tactics for tanks, the first factors to bear in\r\nmind are the powers of the machine, which may be summarised in three\r\nwords: “penetration with security.” Heretofore fronts had remained to\r\nall intents and purposes inviolable to direct infantry attacks; the\r\ntank was now going to break down this deadlock through its ability to\r\ncross wire and trenches under fire with far less risk than infantry\r\ncould ever hope for. Mechanically, the machine was far from perfect,\r\nconsequently, it was laid down, as a general rule, that never fewer\r\nthan two tanks should operate together, and when possible not fewer\r\nthan four.\r\n\r\nFrom a military point of view the penetration of a line of defence\r\ndoes not simply mean passing straight through it, but cutting it in\r\nhalf, and then by moving outwards as well as forwards to push back and\r\nenvelop the flanks thus created and so widen the base of operation to\r\nadmit the movement forwards of reserves and supplies, and the movement\r\nbackwards of casualties and tired troops. A man getting through a\r\nhedge first selects a weak spot (point of attack), he then forces his\r\narms through the branches (penetration), and pushing them outwards\r\n(envelopment), forms a sufficiently large gap (base of operations) to\r\npermit of his body (army) passing easily through the hedge (enemy’s\r\ndefences).\r\n\r\nThe operation of penetration with tanks is just the same. Take a\r\nhalf section, two machines; this half section first penetrates the\r\nenemy’s defences by crossing them (see diagram 7), then by moving\r\noutwards, say to the left, starts enlarging the base by driving the\r\nenemy towards A, and so makes a gap between the point of penetration\r\nand A, for the infantry to move through. As the enemy may, whilst the\r\ntanks are working towards A, seek refuge in his dugouts and “come to\r\nlife” again after the tanks have passed by, it is necessary that the\r\ntanks should be followed by an infantry “mopping up” party which will\r\nbomb the dugouts and so render “coming to life” less frequent. As the\r\nbombing party has to work up the trench with the tank, it cannot hold\r\nthe trench once it is cleared, consequently another party of infantry\r\nshould follow the bombers, whose duty it is to garrison the trench on\r\nit being captured. We therefore find that even in the smallest tank\r\nattack two parties of infantry are required: in trench warfare these\r\nare known as “moppers up” and “support,” and in field warfare as\r\n“firing line” and “supports.” Frequently it is as well to add another\r\nparty, a “reserve,” so that some definite force of men may be held in\r\nhand to meet any unexpected event.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagrams 7-12]\r\n\r\nIf instead of two tanks we use four, a much more effective operation\r\nmay be carried out. The tanks can either penetrate at one place, and\r\nwheel outwards by pairs (see diagram 8), or by pairs penetrate at\r\ntwo separate points and wheel inwards, pinching on the centre (see\r\ndiagram 9), or two can wheel to a flank and two proceed straight ahead\r\n(see diagram 10) and threaten the enemy’s line of retreat. When this\r\nlatter operation is contemplated it is as well to make use of at least\r\nsix machines, better twelve, _i.e._ a complete company of tanks. If\r\nsix machines are used they normally should strike the enemy’s line\r\nat approximately the same place; from there one half section should\r\ngo straight forward and one to each flank, forming what has been\r\ncalled the “Trident formation” (see diagram 11). If twelve machines\r\nare employed, then each section of four tanks strikes the trench at\r\na separate point, the centre section forging straight ahead and the\r\nflanking sections moving inwards and outwards as depicted in diagram 12.\r\n\r\nParticular attention should be paid to the outward movements of the\r\nflanks, for, as the flanks of our own penetrating or attacking force\r\nare generally the most vulnerable points, if we can push forward\r\noffensive wings on these flanks we shall not only be protecting our\r\nown flanks from attack, by giving the enemy no time to attack in, but\r\nwe shall be protecting our central line of advance as well. The force\r\noperating along this central line not only depends for its movement\r\nforward on the security of its flanks, but also on the size of the\r\nbase of operations; the broader this base the more secure will it be,\r\nfor the one thing an attacking army wishes to avoid is getting into a\r\npocket on the interior of which all hostile fire is concentrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagrams 13-15]\r\n\r\nFrom the above elementary movements can be worked out a whole series\r\nof battle formations according to the various arms which are to be\r\nemployed. The following three were those generally used by tanks from\r\nthe battle of Cambrai onwards:\r\n\r\n(1) _An attack against trenches with an artillery barrage_ (see diagram\r\n13).--Three tanks in line at 100 to 200 yards’ interval, followed\r\nby infantry in sections, each section forming an independent fighting\r\nunit advancing in single file and attacking in line, the whole forming\r\none firing line. Behind this firing line should advance one tank and a\r\ncertain number of infantry sections as a support. Reserves can be added\r\nas necessary.\r\n\r\n(2) _An attack against trenches without an artillery barrage_ (see\r\ndiagram 14).--One tank in advance, followed at a distance of 100 to\r\n150 yards by two others at 200 to 300 yards’ interval, and one tank in\r\nsupport. The infantry should be disposed of as before. The advanced\r\ntank to a certain extent replaces the artillery barrage and acts as a\r\nscout to the two behind, which form part of the infantry firing line.\r\n\r\n(3) _The field warfare attack_ (see diagram 15).--In the field attack\r\nthe action of the tanks must be adapted to circumstances. This action\r\nfalls under three headings:\r\n\r\n(i) Moving in front of the infantry firing line.\r\n\r\n(ii) Moving with the infantry firing line.\r\n\r\n(iii) Moving behind the infantry firing line.\r\n\r\nWhen moving with the infantry firing line, which will generally be the\r\nmost suitable formation to adopt, tank sections should form mobile\r\nstrong points or bastions, which will not only reduce the number of\r\ninfantry required for the firing line, but which will be able to bring\r\noblique and cross fire to bear in front of the advancing infantry. In\r\norder to reduce the human target as much as possible without reducing\r\nfire effect, Lewis-gun sections should freely be used to cover by fire\r\nthe intervals between tank sections. These Lewis-gun sections should be\r\nfollowed by rifle sections which, directly opposition is broken down by\r\nthe tanks and the Lewis gunners, should move rapidly forward several\r\nhundred yards in front of the tank and infantry firing line, forming\r\nto it a protective screen of sharpshooters. This formation should then\r\nbe maintained until the rifle sections get hung up, when the tank and\r\nLewis-gun firing line should pass through them to renew the attack, the\r\nrifle sections forming up in support in rear. Curiously enough this\r\nformation resembles very closely that generally adopted by the Roman\r\nVelites and Hastati (riflemen), Principes (Lewis gunners), Triarii\r\n(tanks), and Napoleon’s Light Infantry (riflemen), Infantry of the Line\r\n(Lewis gunners), Old Guard and Heavy Cavalry (tanks).\r\n\r\nAs an infantry attack depends on the following principles--the\r\nobjective, the offensive, security, mass, economy of force, surprise,\r\nmovement, and co-operation--so does a tank attack. The tank must\r\nknow what it is after, it must act vigorously, it must be protected\r\nby artillery just like infantry, it must attack in mass, that is in\r\nstrength and numbers, but not, necessarily, all in one place; it must\r\nsurprise the enemy, move as rapidly as it can, and work hand in glove\r\nwith the other arms. On the application of these principles to the\r\nconditions which will be met with will depend the success or failure of\r\nthe tank attack.\r\n\r\nThe first condition to inquire into is the position of the objective;\r\nis the ground leading up to it suitable for tank movement, is the\r\ncountry on the flank of such a nature as to permit of offensive wings\r\nbeing formed? The second is the position and number of the enemy’s\r\nguns; can these be controlled by counter-battery work or smoke; how\r\nwill they affect the lines of approach and their selection? The\r\nthird is the number of subsidiary objectives before the final one\r\nis captured. The fourth is the “springing off” position of our own\r\ninfantry, and the fifth is, how can the enemy be surprised? These five\r\nquestions being satisfactorily answered, the normal procedure is to\r\ndivide the whole tank force into a main body and two wings; to take\r\nthese three forces and to divide each up into as many lines of tanks\r\nas there are objectives to be attacked; to divide each objective up\r\ninto tank attack areas according to the number of tactical points\r\neach contains. Provided the enemy does not possess tanks himself, or\r\na sure antidote to their use, which the Germans never did possess, a\r\nwell-considered and mounted tank, infantry, artillery, and aeroplane\r\nattack is the nearest approach to _certainty of success_ that has ever\r\nbeen devised in the history of war. No well-planned extensive tank\r\nattack has in the past ever failed, and each one has resulted in\r\nmore prisoners having been captured than casualties suffered. These\r\nare historic facts and not mere pæans of praise; they, consequently,\r\ndeserve our most careful consideration when eventually we plan and\r\nprepare for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF ARRAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great battles which opened the Allies’ 1917 campaign on the Western\r\nFront were the direct outcome of two main causes:\r\n\r\n(i) The strategical positions of the opposing Armies resulting from the\r\nbattle of the Aisne in 1914.\r\n\r\n(ii) The tactical position of the same Armies resulting from the battle\r\nof the Somme in 1916.\r\n\r\nThe former placed nine-tenths of the German Army in the west, in a huge\r\nsalient Ostend-Noyon-Nancy; the latter a considerable portion of that\r\nArmy in a smaller one, Arras-Gommecourt-Morval. The former offered\r\npossibilities for the Allies to get in a right and left hand blow on\r\ntwo of the main centres of the German communications--Valenciennes and\r\nMézières; the latter a right and left hand blow in the direction of\r\nQueant against the northern and southern flanks of the German Sixth and\r\nFirst Armies.\r\n\r\nHad it been possible to bring off these latter blows successfully, such\r\na debacle of the German forces would have resulted that not only would\r\nthe advance of the British First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Armies have\r\nseriously threatened Valenciennes, but the rush of German reserves to\r\nstop the gap would have withdrawn pressure from before the French about\r\nReims, and would probably have enabled them to advance on Mézières.\r\n\r\nA plan for an attack in the vicinity of Arras had been considered\r\nshortly before the opening of the battle of the Somme on July 1, 1916;\r\nit was then dropped, only to be revived in October, when the plan\r\ncontemplated was to drive in the northern flank of the Gommecourt\r\nsalient. It was hoped to employ two battalions of forty-eight tanks\r\neach in this operation; but, as the tanks promised in January did not\r\nmaterialise until the end of April, this plan had to be continually\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a hostile operation began to take place which bid fair to\r\nfilch from us the tactical advantage we had won during the preceding\r\nsummer. Towards the end of February it became apparent that the\r\nGermans intended to evacuate the Gommecourt salient; and the recent\r\nconstruction of the Hindenburg Line suggested a rounding off of the\r\nright angle between Arras and Craonne.\r\n\r\nThe German retirement necessitated certain changes in the British plan\r\nof operations. The Fourth Army relieved the French between the Somme\r\nand Roye; the Third Army, consisting of five Corps and three Cavalry\r\nDivisions, was now to penetrate the German defences, and by marching on\r\nCambrai turn the Hindenburg Line from Heninel to Marcoing; the First\r\nand Fifth Armies were to operate on the left and right flanks of the\r\nThird Army.\r\n\r\nThe success of the British plan of attack depended on penetrating not\r\nonly the German front-line system, but also the Drocourt-Queant line\r\nwithin forty-eight hours of initiating the attack; for, by so doing, so\r\nsevere a wound would be inflicted that the Germans would be forced to\r\nmove their reserves towards Cambrai and Douai, and away from Soissons\r\nand Reims, where the main blow was eventually to fall. Time, therefore,\r\nwas, as usual, the all-important factor--could the Drocourt-Queant line\r\nbe penetrated before the enemy was able to assemble his reserves?\r\n\r\nTanks, it was decided, should assist in gaining this time, yet on April\r\n1, after denuding the training grounds of both England and France, only\r\n60 Mark I and Mark II tanks could be reckoned on for the battle.\r\n\r\nThere were three ways in which these sixty tanks could be used,\r\neither by concentrating the whole against one objective such as\r\nMonchy-le-Preux, if a penetration of the centre were required, or\r\nagainst Bullecourt, if an envelopment of the German left flank were\r\nconsidered necessary, or to allot a proportion of machines to each Army\r\nor Corps for minor “mopping up” operations.\r\n\r\nThe last-mentioned course was eventually adopted and the following\r\nallotment of machines made:\r\n\r\n(i) Eight tanks, to the First Army to operate against the Vimy Heights\r\nand the village of Thelus.\r\n\r\n(ii) Forty tanks to the Third Army, eight to operate with the XVIIth\r\nCorps north of the river Scarpe, and thirty-two to operate with the\r\nVIth and VIIth Corps south of the river Scarpe.\r\n\r\n(iii) Twelve tanks to operate with the Fifth Army.\r\n\r\nThe Third Army plan of operations was as follows: The VIth and VIIth\r\nCorps were to attack south of the river Scarpe between Arras and\r\nMercatel. Their objective ran from a point 2,000 yards south-east of\r\nHenin-sur-Cojeul northwards to Guemappe, thence east of Monchy-le-Preux\r\nto the Scarpe. This objective was 10,000 yards in length and 8,000 in\r\ndepth. It contained two formidable lines of defences:\r\n\r\n(i) The Cojeul-Neuville Vitasse-Telegraph hill-Harp-Tilloy les\r\nMafflaines line, much of which had been fortified for over two years.\r\n\r\n(ii) The Feuchy Chapel-Feuchy line.\r\n\r\nSouth of these systems was the Hindenburg Line, and east of them\r\nMonchy-le-Preux, which dominates the whole of the surrounding country.\r\nThree valleys lie between this eminence and the city of Arras.\r\n\r\nThe XVIIth Corps was to continue the attack north of the river Scarpe\r\nand occupy a line running from east of Fampoux to the Point du Jour,\r\nand thence to a point 4,000 yards east of Roclincourt. The country\r\nalong the northern bank of the Scarpe was intricate, and in it many\r\nexcellent positions existed for hostile machine-guns. Further, the\r\nrailway running to Bailleul was in itself a formidable obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe First Army attack comprised the taking of the famous Vimy Heights,\r\nThelus and the hill north of Thelus, a position considered one of the\r\nstrongest in France.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Army was to operate between Lagnicourt and the right of the\r\nThird Army, driving northwards towards Vis-en-Artois. The operation to\r\nbe carried out by this Army was a most difficult one. The destruction\r\nof the roads and the bad weather had rendered it impossible to move\r\nforward sufficient artillery--a _sine qua non_ of all attacks of this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the above operations were to be considered as the\r\npreliminaries to the advance of two Cavalry Divisions and the XVIIIth\r\nCorps south of the Scarpe, which force was to break through at Monchy\r\nand advance eastwards on to the Drocourt-Queant line.\r\n\r\nThe general preparations required for a tank battle will be dealt with\r\nin another chapter, suffice it here to state that they were divided\r\nup as follows--preliminary reconnaissances, the formation of forward\r\nsupply dumps, the preparation of tankodromes and places of assembly,\r\nthe programme of rail movements and the fixing and preparing of the\r\ntank routes forward from the tankodromes.\r\n\r\nReconnaissances were started as early as January, and were most\r\nthoroughly carried out. Supply dumps were formed at Beaurains,\r\nAchicourt, near Roclincourt and Neuville St. Vaast. As no supply tanks\r\nwere in existence, supplies had to be carried forward by hand and, at\r\nthe time, it was reckoned that had these machines been forthcoming,\r\neach one would have saved a carrying party of from 300 to 400 men.\r\nThe railheads for the Fifth, Third, and First Armies were selected at\r\nAchiet le Grand, Montenescourt, and Acq respectively. The movements\r\nof tanks and supplies to these stations were successfully carried out\r\nafter several minor hitches, such as trucks giving way, trains running\r\nlate, and, on March 22, 20,000 gallons of petrol being destroyed in\r\na railway accident. Incidents such as these are, however, of little\r\naccount if the plan has been worked out with foresight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF ARRAS\r\n\r\n9th April 1917.]\r\n\r\nThe only real mishap which occurred took place on the night of April\r\n8-9, to a column of tanks which was moving up from Achicourt to\r\nthe starting-points. Achicourt lies in a valley through which runs\r\nthe Crinchon stream. The surface of the ground here is hard, but\r\nunder this superficial crust lies, in places, boggy soil which was\r\nonly discovered when six tanks broke through the top strata and\r\nfloundered in a morass of mud and water. Those who were present will\r\nnever forget the hours which followed this mishap. Eventually the tanks\r\nwere got out, but too late to take part in the initial attack on the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nOn April 7 and 8 the weather was fine, but, as ill-luck would have\r\nit, heavy rain fell during the early morning of the 9th. At zero\r\nhour (dawn) the tanks moved off behind the infantry, but the heavily\r\n“crumped” area on the Vimy Ridge, soaked by rain as it now was, proved\r\ntoo much for the tanks of the First Army, and all became ditched at a\r\npoint 500 yards east of the German front line, and never took part in\r\nany actual fighting. The four which started from Roclincourt had but\r\nlittle better luck, and though they advanced considerably further they\r\nalso ditched and went out of action.\r\n\r\nThe artillery barrage was magnificent and the Canadians went forward\r\nunder it and took the Vimy Heights almost at a rush, capturing several\r\nthousand prisoners. The rapidity of this advance, due to the excellent\r\nwork of our artillery and the dash of the Canadians, rendered the\r\nco-operation of tanks needless; it was, therefore, decided to withdraw\r\nthe eight machines with the First Army, and send them to the Fifth\r\nArmy. Those from Roclincourt were also withdrawn to reinforce those\r\noperating immediately north of the Scarpe.\r\n\r\nThe four tanks which started just east of Arras had better luck, for\r\nthough one was knocked out by shell fire shortly after starting, the\r\nremaining three worked eastwards down the Scarpe and rendered valuable\r\nassistance to the infantry by “mopping up” hostile machine-guns.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Scarpe the infantry attacked with equal élan. About Tilloy\r\nles Mafflaines, the Harp, and Telegraph hill the tanks caught up with\r\nthe attack and accounted for a good many Germans, and then, pushing\r\non, helped in the reduction of the Blue line (Neuville Vitasse-Bois\r\ndes Bœufs-Hervin farm) and such parts of the Brown (Heninel-Feuchy\r\nChapel-Feuchy) as they were able to reach during daylight. The ground\r\non the Harp, an immensely strong earthwork, was much “crumped” and some\r\nof the trenches had 2 ft. of water in them. A good many tanks bellied\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the tanks on the 9th can only be considered as\r\npartially successful--due chiefly to the difficulty of the ground, wet\r\nand heavily shelled, and the rapidity of the infantry advance.\r\n\r\nOn the following day only minor operations were undertaken, and salvage\r\nwas at once started, the ditched tanks being dug out and withdrawn to\r\nrefit.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th three important tank attacks were made, the first from\r\nFeuchy Chapel on Monchy; the second from Neuville Vitasse down the\r\nHindenburg Line, and the third against the village of Bullecourt.\r\n\r\nThe first attack was eminently successful for, though only three of the\r\nsix tanks which started from Feuchy Chapel reached Monchy, it was due\r\nto the gallant way in which they were fought more than to any other\r\ncause that the infantry were able to occupy this extremely valuable\r\ntactical position. Once Monchy was captured the cavalry moved forward.\r\nFrom all accounts the Germans, at this period of the battle, were in a\r\nhigh state of demoralisation, but notwithstanding this, as long as they\r\npossessed a few stout-hearted machine-gunners, an effective cavalry\r\nadvance was impossible, and the only arm which could have rendered\r\nits employment feasible was the tank--the machine-gun destroyer--and\r\nas there were no longer any fit or capable of coming into action the\r\nGermans found time to stiffen their defence and to consolidate their\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe second attack was made from Neuville Vitasse with four tanks. These\r\nmachines worked right down the Hindenburg Line to Heninel, driving the\r\nGermans underground and killing great numbers of them. They then turned\r\nnorth-east towards Wancourt, and for several hours engaged the Germans\r\nin the vicinity of this village. All four eventually got back to our\r\nlines after having fought a single-handed action for between eight and\r\nnine hours. It was a memorable little action in spite of the fact that\r\nits ultimate value was not great.\r\n\r\nThe third operation, the attack on and east of the village of\r\nBullecourt, is the most interesting of the three. All previous\r\noperations in this battle had been based on the timing and strength\r\nof the artillery barrage, the tanks taking a purely subordinate part.\r\nIn the present attack the position of the tanks, as compared with\r\nthe other arms, was reversed; for they took the leading part, and\r\nthough the attack was eventually a failure, they demonstrated clearly\r\nthe possibility of tanks carrying out duties which up to the present\r\nhad been definitely allotted to artillery--the two chief ones being\r\nwire-cutting and the creeping barrage which, henceforth, could be\r\ncarried out by wire-crushing and the mobile barrage produced by the\r\ntank 6-pounders and machine-guns.\r\n\r\nThe plan of attack was as follows: 11 tanks were to be drawn up in line\r\nat 80 yards interval from each other, and at 800 yards distance from\r\nthe German line. Their task was to penetrate the Hindenburg Line east\r\nof Bullecourt; 6 to wheel westwards (4 to attack Bullecourt and 2 the\r\nHindenburg Line north-west of Bullecourt), 3 to advance on Reincourt\r\nand Hendecourt, and 2 to move eastwards down the Hindenburg trenches.\r\nThis operation was similar to the one already discussed in Chapter\r\nVIII, “Tank Tactics,” and called the “Trident Formation.”\r\n\r\nAll 11 tanks started at zero, which was fixed at 4.30 a.m. Those\r\non the wings were rapidly put out of action by hostile artillery\r\nfire; however, 2 out of the 3, ordered to advance on Reincourt\r\nand Hendecourt, entered these villages and the infantry following\r\nsuccessfully occupied them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the very heavy casualties suffered, the tanks in the\r\ncentre had carried out their work successfully, when a strong\r\nconverging German counter-attack, partly due to the impossibility of\r\ncreating offensive flanks to our central attack, retook the villages\r\nof Reincourt and Hendecourt, captured the two tanks and several\r\nhundred men of the 4th Australian Division. The loss of the two\r\ntanks was unfortunate, for the Germans discovered that their latest\r\narmour-piercing bullets would penetrate their sides and sponsons.\r\nThis discovery led to a German order being published that all infantry\r\nshould in future carry a certain number of these bullets.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the Bullecourt operation lies in the fact that it was\r\nthe first occasion on which tanks were used to replace artillery. It\r\nfailed for various reasons--the haste with which the operation was\r\nprepared; the changes in the plan of attack on the night prior to the\r\nattack; the unavoidable lack of artillery support; and above all the\r\ninsufficiency of tanks for such an operation and the lack of confidence\r\non the part of the infantry in the tanks themselves.\r\n\r\nBetween April 12 and 22 all tank operations were of a minor nature. By\r\nthe 20th of this month thirty of the original machines were refitted\r\nand on the 23rd eleven of these were employed in operations around\r\nMonchy, Gavrelle, and the Chemical Works at Rœux; excellent results\r\nwere obtained, but no fewer than five out of the eleven machines\r\nsustained serious casualties from armour-piercing bullets, which had\r\nnow become the backbone of the enemy’s anti-tank defence.\r\n\r\nThe general result of the tank operations was favourable, though the\r\nnumber of casualties sustained exceeded expectation. The value of the\r\nwork they accomplished was recognised by all the units with which they\r\nworked. The casualties they inflicted on the enemy were undoubtedly\r\nheavy; in most cases where they advanced the infantry attack succeeded,\r\nand the highest compliment which was paid to their efficiency came\r\nfrom the enemy himself, who took every possible step to counter their\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe operations showed that the training of all ranks had been carried\r\nout on sound and practical lines. The fighting spirit of the men was\r\nhigh, the tanks being fought with great gallantry. One commanding\r\nofficer stated, in his report on the battle, that the behaviour of\r\nhis officers and men might be summed up as “a triumph of moral over\r\ntechnical difficulties.”\r\n\r\nThis fine fighting spirit was undoubtedly due to the excellent\r\nleadership all officers and N.C.O.s had exercised during individual\r\nand collective training; and to the full recreational training given\r\nto the battalions during these periods, games and sports as a fighting\r\nbasis having been sedulously cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe main tactical lessons learnt and accentuated were:--that tanks\r\nshould be used in mass, that is they should be concentrated and not\r\ndispersed; that a separate force of tanks should be allotted to each\r\nobjective, and that a strong reserve should always be kept in hand;\r\nthat sections and, if possible, companies should be kept intact; that\r\nthe Mark I and Mark II machines were not suitable to use over wet\r\nheavily-shelled ground; that the moral effect of tanks was very great;\r\nthat counter-battery work is essential to their security; and that\r\nsupply and signal tanks are an absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of April 10 the Colonel Commanding the Heavy Branch\r\nreceived the following telegram from the Commander-in-Chief:\r\n\r\n“My congratulations on the excellent work performed by the Heavy Branch\r\nof the Machine Gun Corps during yesterday’s operations. Please convey\r\nto those who took part my appreciation of the gallantry and skill shown\r\nby them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTANK BATTLE RECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to record the personal experiences of each tank Crew\r\nCommander in battle, and to collect statistics as to the work of the\r\ntanks themselves, shortly before the battle of Arras was fought, a\r\nform was introduced known as a “Tank Battle History Sheet.” These\r\nsheets were issued to Crew Commanders prior to an engagement, were\r\nfilled in by them after its completion and, eventually, forwarded\r\nto Tank Corps Headquarters, where they were summarised by the Tank\r\nCorps General Staff. By this means it was possible to collect many\r\nvaluable experiences from the soldiers themselves, information which\r\nunfortunately so frequently is apt to evaporate when the final battle\r\nreport starts on its journey from one headquarters to the next.\r\n\r\nOutside the material value of these reports they frequently possessed\r\na psychological value, and by reading them with a little insight it\r\nwas possible to gauge, with fair accuracy, the moral of the fighting\r\nmen, an “atmosphere” so difficult to breathe when in rear of the battle\r\nline, so impossible to create, and yet so necessary to the mental\r\nhealth of the General Staff and the Higher Command.\r\n\r\nThis system of record, initiated at the battle of Arras, was maintained\r\nin the Tank Corps up to the conclusion of the war, many hundreds of\r\nthese brief histories being written. The following are taken, almost at\r\nrandom, from those made out during the above-mentioned battle, and are\r\nfair examples of early tank fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE HISTORY OF CREW NO. D.6.

To wait at rallying-point N.E. of Neuville\r\nVitasse until infantry advanced again towards Wancourt. To proceed with\r\ninfantry to Wancourt and assist them wherever necessary.\r\n\r\n_Report of action._--Tank left starting-point at Beaurains at\r\n6.30 a.m., on April 9, 1917, crossed our front line at 7.27 a.m.,\r\nattacking Telegraph hill with the infantry at 7.30 a.m.; then worked\r\ntowards Neuville Vitasse along the Hindenburg Line. At a point about\r\n1,000 yards N.E. of Neuville Vitasse, the tank was caught in a trap\r\nconsisting of a large gun-pit carefully covered with turf. I and\r\nSergeant B---- immediately got out and went to guide other tanks clear\r\nof the trap in spite of M.G. and shell fire.\r\n\r\n      (Signed) A----, Lieut.,\r\n                O.C.

Having rectified this, I proceeded to join\r\nD.10--D.11 as ordered.\r\n\r\nI eventually found these tanks out of action and proceeded alone to a\r\nfurther line of trenches, where I met with decidedly severe hostile\r\nmachine-gun and shell fire. I consider we were successful in quelling\r\none of the many sniper posts, but on account of being ditched were\r\nprevented from proceeding. It would appear, however, that the presence\r\nof my tank--it being on the right flank of our infantry, which was\r\nup in the air--was a deterrent to the enemy, of whom small bodies\r\nwere still in existence in the vicinity. I caused my 6-pounders to\r\nbe manned, and we held our position for three days, when the tank\r\nwas eventually got out of her position. As a whole, the crew worked\r\ntogether well and cheerfully, but I would especially commend Corporal\r\nD---- for unfailing cheerfulness and devotion to duty under very trying\r\nand disappointing circumstances.\r\n\r\n      (Signed) C----, 2nd Lieut.,\r\n                O.C.

It was eventually left to my\r\ndecision as to the possibility of attempting this third objective.\r\n\r\n_Report of action._--Advanced with infantry, but owing to heavy mist\r\nhad great difficulty in following exact route. Reached first objective\r\nat 5.20 a.m., having approached it from the river side. Successfully\r\ndealt with several of the enemy on left bank of river, causing them\r\nto retire. Cruised about until joined by tank No. 522, D. 3. Then\r\nproceeded towards second objective. On the way I saw our infantry\r\nretiring, went ahead to stop enemy advance. Whilst going forward I\r\nsaw Lieutenant F----’s tank, which was then off its route. Lieutenant\r\nF---- came out of his tank and informed me that he had lost his way. I\r\nredirected him, and he then rejoined his tank. Almost immediately after\r\nthis (approx. 6.30 a.m.) both tanks came under direct anti-tank gun and\r\nmachine-gun fire. The latter was silenced by my left 6-pounder gun.\r\nI manœuvred to present as small a target as possible to the former.\r\nThe tank, however, received about six direct hits, which damaged both\r\ntracks, set alight the spare petrol carried in box in rear of tank,\r\nand possibly caused other serious damage.

Tank to assist infantry and after\r\nobjective at river taken to proceed to Croisilles.\r\n\r\n_Report of action._--I started from starting-point at T.4.b.4.5 at\r\nzero, and made for Hindenburg wire at T.6.a.0.5, crossing same and\r\ngetting into touch with our infantry, from whom I received report\r\nthat they were held up by machine-guns along the trench. I proceeded\r\nto this point and cleared the obstacle. I then travelled parallel to\r\nthe trench, knocking out machine-gun emplacements and snipers’ posts\r\nall the way down to point U.1.c.5.0. The infantry kept in touch all\r\nthe way down, moving slightly in rear of tank, and after emplacements\r\nwere knocked out they took the occupants prisoners. In two cases white\r\nflags were hoisted as soon as the emplacement was hit. The shooting\r\nwas very good. Up to point U.1.c.5.0 the shelling had been casual, but\r\nwhen we reached the N. bank of the sunken road at this point and were\r\nfiring into emplacements towards the river we were in full observation\r\nfrom the village and the artillery fire became very heavy. The supply\r\nof 6-pounder ammunition now became exhausted, and the ground on the\r\nS. side of sunken road being very bad, I decided to move back along\r\nthe trench and then crossed the wire, and crossing sunken road at\r\nabout T.12.b.5.3, made for rallying-point at Factory at Croisilles,\r\nwhere I arrived at 12 noon. I was shelled heavily all the way back to\r\nthe rallying-point, but no damage was done. I was of opinion that the\r\nHindenburg front line was too bad (wide) to cross, and so could not\r\ndeal with support line and was unable to observe this line from front\r\nline. I sent two pigeon messages at 9.30 a.m. and 12 noon. I had only\r\none message clip, so had to fasten second message with cotton.\r\n\r\n      (Signed) G----, 2nd Lieut.,\r\n                O.C.

Having learnt that the other car which was operating\r\nwith me was “out of action,” I made my way alone to the railway arch,\r\nwhere I was held up some few minutes owing to a number of stretcher\r\ncases which had to be removed, and a sand-bag barricade which I could\r\nnot push down.\r\n\r\nI soon caught up the infantry, who were held up by machine-gun fire in\r\nMount Pleasant wood. At their request I altered my course and made for\r\nthe northern side of the wood running parallel with the trench which we\r\nheld at the south of the wood, and which the enemy held at the north.\r\nI was told that a bombing party would follow me up the trench.\r\n\r\nHaving cleared this wood, I pushed on towards the village of Rœux,\r\nwhere I again met the infantry who had come round the other side of\r\nMount Pleasant wood, where they were again held up by machine-gun fire\r\nwhich came from the buildings.\r\n\r\nOur barrage could only have been very slight, to judge from the\r\ncomparatively small amount of damage which was done to the buildings.\r\nHere I used 200 rounds of 6-pounder ammunition.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate with any accuracy the number of\r\nmachine-guns actually “put out.” One of my best targets was a party of\r\nsome thirty men whom we drove out of a house with 6-pounders, and then\r\nsprayed with Lewis-gun fire.\r\n\r\nI am sure that at least one 6-pounder shell dropped amongst these--this\r\nmade a distinct impression.\r\n\r\nAnother target that presented itself was a party of men coming towards\r\nus. I do not know whether they intended giving themselves up or whether\r\nthey were a bombing party--I took them for the latter.\r\n\r\nParties were frequently seen coming up from the rear, through gaps in\r\nthe buildings.\r\n\r\nTwice an enemy officer rallied some dozen or so men and rushed a house\r\nthat we had already cleared. Here again a 6-pounder through the window\r\ndisposed of any of the enemy remaining in the buildings.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the machine-guns in the wood, we could only locate them\r\nby little puffs of smoke at which we fired our 6-pounders. We did not\r\ntake our departure until these puffs had disappeared, and there was in\r\nconsequence reasonable ground to suppose that the guns had been knocked\r\nout. Finally our infantry reached the village. Apparently there was no\r\nofficer commanding our infantry in this part of the line.\r\n\r\nI then moved towards Rœux wood and learnt of a sniper still left in\r\nMount Pleasant wood and a machine-gun, which was causing great trouble,\r\non the railway embankment, and I then made my way back to the railway\r\narch with a view to running parallel with the embankment towards the\r\nstation, but unfortunately my car bellied in the very marshy ground by\r\nthe canal.\r\n\r\nWith regard to casualties, it is my opinion that I was in the district\r\nsufficiently long enough, some three hours, to enable the enemy to send\r\nfor a supply of armour-piercing bullets. All four of my crew were hit\r\nwhilst in the car.\r\n\r\nThe Lewis-gun mountings were bad, many targets were lost owing to the\r\ntime it took to mount the gun, and finally we mounted the gun through\r\nthe front flaps. The flap of the present mounting does not rise high\r\nenough to clear the foresight.\r\n\r\nBoth the 6-pounder guns worked splendidly, only giving one misfire\r\nthe whole time. There was no hostile shelling of any kind in the\r\nvillage of Rœux or immediately in the district where I was operating,\r\nbut the enemy barrage falling round the railway was of a very severe\r\nnature. When I found that it was impossible for me to proceed towards\r\nthe railway station, I sent off a pigeon message at the request of\r\nan O.C. requesting that one of the cars operating in the Chemical\r\nWorks district should be detailed to deal with the machine-gun on the\r\nembankment.\r\n\r\nI cannot speak too highly of the efficiency and general work of the\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nI have handed two German diaries, which came into my possession, to the\r\nCompany Intelligence Officer.\r\n\r\n      (Signed) H----, 2nd Lieut.,\r\n                O.C. Tank No. 716.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BATTLE OF GAZA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn account of the assistance rendered to the British infantry by tanks\r\nduring the battle of the Somme a decision was arrived at in England to\r\ndespatch a number of these machines to Egypt to assist our troops in\r\nthe Sinai peninsula, especially in the neighbourhood of El Arish, south\r\nof the Turkish frontier. The number originally decided on was twelve,\r\nbut this was eventually cut down to eight, and, through an unfortunate\r\nerror, old experimental machines were sent out instead of new ones as\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nThe detachment, under the command of Major N. Nutt, consisted of 22\r\nofficers and 226 other ranks drawn from the original E Company, and\r\ntogether with its tanks, workshops, and transport, it embarked at\r\nDevonport and Avonmouth in December 1916, arriving in Egypt during the\r\nfollowing month.\r\n\r\nDemonstrations and schemes were at once arranged for so that the staffs\r\nof the various fighting formations could witness what tanks were able\r\nto accomplish. These schemes were carried out on the sand dunes near\r\nGilban, some ten miles north of Kantara on the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nIn February,[22] orders were suddenly received one day for the\r\ndetachment to move with all possible speed to the fighting zone. This\r\nwas carried out, and within three hours of receiving the orders the\r\nentire detachment, with tanks and accessories, had entrained at Gilban,\r\nand was speeding northwards towards the area of operations. Next day a\r\ndelay occurred at El Arish, which the day previously had been captured\r\nby the Australians; but, the same evening, the train proceeded to Rafa,\r\na frontier town, which had only just been evacuated by the Turks, and\r\nearly next morning reached Khan Yunus, some fifteen miles south-west\r\nof Gaza, an old Crusader stronghold surrounded by vast fig groves and\r\nother vegetation; here the detachment remained for ten days.\r\n\r\nDuring this halt the First Battle of Gaza had come to an end, our\r\ntroops having been obliged to retire and take up a position to\r\nthe south of the town owing to the appearance of strong Turkish\r\nreinforcements from the direction of Beersheba; these threatened the\r\nBritish communications.\r\n\r\nHostilities now ceased and preparations were begun for the Second\r\nBattle of Gaza, which was to prove one of the fiercest contests of the\r\nwar in its eastern theatre. For this battle, early in March, the Tank\r\nDetachment moved from Khan Yunus to Deir el Belah.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Army at this period, numbering some 30,000 men, was\r\ndisposed along a sixteen-mile front extending from Gaza south-eastwards\r\nto Hareira and Shekia. The British plan of operations was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe G.O.C. Desert Column was entrusted with the operations against the\r\nHareira front, protecting the right flank, whilst the task of seizing\r\nthe important ridges of Sheikh Abbas and Mansara, both commanding Gaza\r\nand situated to the south of this town, was assigned to the 52nd, 53rd,\r\nand 54th Divisions; the 74th Division remaining in general reserve.\r\n\r\nThe tanks of the detachment, which had been held in G.H.Q. reserve,\r\nwere now allotted to divisions as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) 53rd Division, operating from the sea to the Cairo road, running\r\nthrough Romani trench: two tanks which were to be held in reserve until\r\nthe infantry had advanced to the line--Red House-Tel El Ajjul-Money\r\nHouse-the coast.\r\n\r\n(ii) 52nd Division, operating from Kurd valley to Wadi El Nukhabir:\r\nfour tanks to support the infantry attack on the Mansara ridge.\r\n\r\n(iii) 54th Division, operating on a front extending from 500 yards west\r\nof Abbas ridge to the Gaza-Beersheba road: two tanks to support the\r\ninfantry attack on the Sheikh Abbas ridge.\r\n\r\nZ day was to be April 17. Two days prior to this the eight tanks left\r\nDeir El Belah after dusk, two proceeding over the Druid ridge through\r\nSt. James’s Park, thence by Tel El Nujeid across the Wadi Ghuzze to\r\nMoney hill; four from Deir El Belah in an easterly direction through\r\nPiccadilly Circus over the prominent ridge of In Seirat, then eastwards\r\nto Sheikh Nebhan on the Wadi Ghuzze; two followed the same route as\r\nfar as In Seirat, and from there made for a point south-east of Sheikh\r\nNebhan.\r\n\r\nAll eight tanks reached their positions of assembly before dawn without\r\nmishap and in good condition. Meanwhile ammunition and supply dumps had\r\nbeen established at various spots close to the Wadi Ghuzze.\r\n\r\nIn the battle which now ensued the position of the tanks in relation\r\nto the infantry varied according to the nature of the ground and the\r\nresistance of the enemy. The attacks of the 53rd and 52nd Divisions\r\ncame as a complete surprise, the two tanks allotted to the former moved\r\nto a position south of Money hill on the evening of the first day, and\r\nthe four with the latter reached a point south of the Mansara ridge.\r\nNone of these machines came into action as the Turks retired from their\r\ntrenches and strongholds in complete confusion. On the 54th Division’s\r\nfront both of the tanks allotted to this Division came into action;\r\none, however, received a direct hit and was destroyed, but the other\r\ndid good work in clearing the enemy’s trenches north-west of the Abbas\r\nridge, killing many Turks and enabling our infantry to occupy these\r\ndefences.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of April 17, the three attacking divisions entrenched\r\nthemselves on the line running approximately from Marine View, on\r\nthe coast, through Heart hill-Kurd hill-Mansara-Abbas, and thence\r\nsouth-east to Atawineh ridge. A pause of forty-eight hours now took\r\nplace wherein to prepare for the second phase of the battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SECOND & THIRD BATTLES OF GAZA\r\n\r\n17th April 1917 & 1st November 1917.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 19, this second phase opened. The Australian\r\nCorps, on the right flank, was to deliver an attack on the eastern\r\ndefences of Gaza, whilst the 52nd, 53rd, and 54th Divisions were to\r\nconstitute the main attack, and to advance on a line running from\r\nthe coast to the stronghold of Ali El Muntar. Battleships were to\r\nco-operate in this attack.\r\n\r\nTanks were allotted to Divisions as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) 53rd Division, objective--Mazar trench to Sheikh Redwam; one\r\ntank to assist in the capture of Sampson ridge, El Arish and Sheikh\r\nRedwam redoubts, and one tank to operate against Sheikh Ajlin,\r\nBelah-Yunus-Rafa-Zowaiid-El Burs trenches and to await further orders\r\nat El Arish trench.\r\n\r\n(ii) 52nd Division, objective--the enemy’s trenches from Queen’s hill\r\nto Ali El Muntar. For this operation four tanks were allotted, and\r\ntheir objectives, which were Outpost hill, the Labyrinth, the Warren\r\nand Ali El Muntar, were changed during the night of the 18th-19th. This\r\nresulted in considerable confusion. According to the change one tank\r\nwas to precede the assault on Green hill, one to clear Lees hill and\r\nOutpost hill, and the remaining two to be kept in reserve at Kurd hill.\r\n\r\n(iii) 54th Division, objective--Kirbet El Sihan and El Sire-Ali El\r\nMuntar ridge as far as Australia hill; one tank to seize the redoubt\r\nwest of Kirbet El Sihan.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be seen a good deal was expected of the tanks,\r\nin fact these seven machines were to tackle a problem which in France\r\nwould have been considered distinctly formidable for two complete\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\nOf the two tanks with the 53rd Division one broke its track,\r\nconsequently the other--the Tiger--led the advance alone and drove the\r\nenemy from Sampson ridge, which was then occupied by our infantry; it\r\nthen proceeded to El Arish redoubt, but, the infantry being unable to\r\nfollow, after six hours’ action, during which it fired 27,000 rounds of\r\nS.A.A., it withdrew to Regent’s Park, all its crew having been wounded.\r\nOn the front of the 52nd Division a desperate battle took place: the\r\ntank operating against Lees hill and Outpost hill fell into a gully,\r\nthe sides of which unexpectedly collapsed. Its place was taken by the\r\ntank detailed for Green hill; Outpost hill was reached and cleared,\r\nwhen this machine received a direct hit.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s machine-gun fire was now intense, so one of the reserve\r\ntanks was ordered up. After desperate losses the infantry eventually\r\ncaptured the hill, only to be driven off it by a counter-attack; they\r\nthen withdrew to a line passing east and west through Queen’s hill,\r\nthe reserve tank withdrawing at the same time to Kurd hill. In the\r\nattack delivered by the remaining division, the 54th, no better luck\r\nwas experienced. The one machine working with this division moved on\r\nthe great redoubt north-west of Kirbet El Sihan, and reaching this\r\nwork the Turkish garrison surrendered. The infantry then took over the\r\nposition. Shortly after this a direct hit broke one of the tracks of\r\nthis tank, and a counter-attack eventually resulted in its capture with\r\nthe infantry who had occupied the redoubt.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that this battle was unsuccessful, the work\r\ncarried out by the Tank Detachment constitutes a remarkable feat of\r\narms. The tanks engaged were Mark I’s and II’s, which, by the time\r\nthe battle was ended, had each covered on an average some 40 miles\r\nof country. Reconnaissance, due to want of time, was practically\r\nnon-existent, and the limitations of the tank were not understood\r\nby the infantry commanders, who expected miracles from a far from\r\nperfect machine. The objectives allotted were not only difficult, but\r\ntoo numerous, yet in spite of this the protection which these eight\r\ntanks afforded the attacking infantry on a five-mile frontage was\r\nconsiderable and fully appreciated; it was, however, quite inadequate\r\non account of the hundreds of ingeniously hidden machine-guns, to which\r\nthe Turks mainly owed their victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSTAFF WORK AND BATTLE PREPARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the success or non-success of a battle rest on its\r\norganisation, that is, on the preparations made for it. This is the\r\nduty of the General and Administrative Staffs of an Army or Formation\r\nand usually entails an immense amount of careful work. The fact that\r\nsuccess depends as much, if not more, on organisation (brain power)\r\nas on valour (nerve power) is not generally recognised, and many an\r\nofficer and man in the firing line is, through ignorance of the causes\r\nand effects which are operating behind, only too prone to forget what\r\nthe staff is doing, and, never more so, what the staff has done than\r\nafter a really great victory has been gained.\r\n\r\nThe more scientific weapons become the more will good staff work decide\r\nwhether their use is going to lead to victory or defeat. This was very\r\nearly realised in the Tank Corps, and every endeavour was made by its\r\ncommander and his subordinate leaders to select only the most capable\r\nofficers for their respective staffs; this resulted in ability more\r\noften than seniority deciding the filling of an appointment.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Staff of the Tank Corps was often considerably\r\ncomplicated by the fact that, the tank being a novel weapon of war,\r\nit was little understood, not only by the other arms, but by many\r\nmembers of the Tank Corps itself. This resulted in a great deal of\r\neducational work being required before many measures, very obvious to\r\nthe Staff itself, were accepted by others. In the early days of the\r\nCorps the tank was generally placed by the other arms under one of two\r\ncategories--a miracle or a joke, and this did not tend to facilitate or\r\nexpedite preparations.\r\n\r\nThe main duty of the General Staff is to foresee by thinking ahead, of\r\nthe Administrative Staff to prepare, of the Commander to decide, and\r\nof his troops to act. These four links go to build up a battle, and if\r\nany one of them is defective, the whole chain is weak. On the power\r\nof thinking ahead, that is, foreseeing conditions and events, will\r\ndepend all preparations. Decisions cannot with safety be simply based\r\non former experiences, codified and printed rules and regulations; if\r\nthis were possible every intelligent subaltern with a good memory or\r\na big pocket could become a Napoleon[23] in six weeks. Decisions must\r\nbe based on weapons and men moved in accordance with the principles\r\nof war as governed by conditions existing and possible. Possible\r\nconditions cannot be guessed at; if they could the planchet board and\r\nnot the baton would be the emblem of a field-marshal’s worth. Possible\r\nconditions can only be guarded against or converted into allies by\r\nbeing prepared to meet all eventualities, and these preparations in a\r\nformation such as the Tank Corps were at first prodigious. Little by\r\nlittle, however, the knack of mechanical warfare was cultivated, and\r\nthen what had at first appeared a mountain eventually turned out to be\r\na molehill--a good sprinkling of molehills, and not a few mountains,\r\nhowever, remained over even to the last.\r\n\r\nIn the training schemes carried out before the battle of Arras, as\r\nmentioned in Chapter VII, no fewer than 132 headings of various\r\nmeasures, all relative to the preparations requisite for an offensive\r\nwith tanks, were laid down. After this battle this number was\r\nconsiderably increased and continued to grow as each engagement added\r\nnew experiences to the old ones.\r\n\r\nThe main preparations required for an offensive are the following:\r\n(1) Movements, (2) Reconnaissances, (3) Secrecy, (4) Supply, (5)\r\nCommunication, (6) Assembly, (7) Tactics, (8) Reorganisation.\r\n\r\nTank movements generally fall under the headings of rail movements and\r\ncross-country movements. As regards the former it must be remembered\r\nthat the tank cannot at present move over lengthy distances under its\r\nown power. A Mark I tank on good going could not be relied on to run\r\nmore than 12 miles on a fill of petrol, and after it had completed\r\nabout 70 miles it had to be overhauled and many of its parts renewed.\r\nRail movements require special trucks, and, in the early days of the\r\nCorps, special sidings and entraining ramps. As regards the latter,\r\ncross-country routes should be reconnoitred beforehand. It will be\r\nremembered how on the night of April 8-9, the night previous to the\r\nfirst day of the battle of Arras, six tanks became ditched at Achicourt\r\non account of a bog existing under the hard surface of the ground. Had\r\nthe officer reconnoitring this route tested the ground along the valley\r\nby pushing a stick into it, this accident would not have occurred,\r\nfor the stick would have penetrated the crust and informed him of the\r\nnature of the soil below it.\r\n\r\nBefore any move takes place from the position of assembly, near\r\nrailhead, to the starting-points, the points whence the tanks will\r\nproceed into battle, the following are a few of the subjects that a\r\nTank Unit Commander will have to consider:--Objectives; strong-points;\r\nmachine-gun emplacements; batteries; trenches; wire; infantry lines\r\nof advance; minimum number of tanks required for the main objectives;\r\nminimum of tanks required for subsidiary objectives; nature of ground\r\nand its probable condition at zero hour; where ground, soil, natural\r\nfeatures and hostile batteries will chiefly impede tank movements; the\r\nlines of least resistance for tanks through the enemy’s lines to the\r\nmain objectives and the points of greatest resistance to the infantry\r\nadvance; landmarks; starting points with reference to lines of least\r\nresistance; positions of deployment with reference to starting-points;\r\ntank routes from positions of assembly to the positions of deployment\r\nand thence to the starting-points; any places on these tank routes\r\nwhere delays are likely to occur; rallying points; supply dumps;\r\ncommunication, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nSo in turn must each move or preparatory measure be dealt with,\r\nreconnaissance playing an all-important part, not only before the\r\nbattle, but during it, and immediately after it, and if the system\r\nof communication during the battle is not efficient the work of the\r\nreconnaissance officer will frequently be wasted, so we find one\r\npreparation depending for its worth on another until the whole forms a\r\ncomplete and somewhat intricate chain.\r\n\r\nImagine now, when this chain is nearing completion what it means to it\r\nif some new plan be evolved, or a change be introduced or forced on to\r\na scheme of operations--its effect will frequently have to be carried\r\nright down the chain, and this will not only mean new work being\r\ndone, but old work being undone. Take the following as an example: a\r\nbattalion of tanks is to detrain at A, a few days later it is ordered\r\nto detrain at B instead; this will probably entail shifting 20,000\r\ngallons of petrol, 12,000 6-pounder shells, 300,000 rounds of S.A.A.,\r\nand countless other stores. It is these changes in operations which a\r\ngood Staff guards its troops against by foresight; this being so, the\r\nefficiency of a Staff may usually be gauged by the number of amendments\r\na Commander issues to his orders.\r\n\r\nAnother important duty of the Staff is to assist the troops when\r\nthe period of preparation ends and action begins, and further still\r\nto watch closely every action so that changes may be foreseen and\r\npreparations may be improved on the next occasion. These duties are\r\ncalled “Battle Liaison,” a duty which was impressed upon every General\r\nStaff Officer in the Tank Corps as the most important he would be\r\ncalled upon to carry out. At every battle from that of the Ancre\r\nonwards, the majority of the headquarters’ General Staff Officers were\r\npresent on the battlefield itself, not after the fight had swept on but\r\nbefore it opened and whilst it lasted. Each night these officers would\r\nreport to their headquarters not only what they had heard but what\r\nthey had seen, a much more reliable source of evidence. The result of\r\nthis system was that when the crash came on March 21, 1918, though the\r\nTank Corps was split up over a front of 60 miles, and in many places\r\ncomplete confusion followed the German attack, not once from that day\r\non to the end of the battle did the headquarters of the Tank Corps\r\nlack information regarding the position of all its units. This may be\r\nchronicled as a notable “feat of staff work,” and certainly as useful\r\nas many a much more spectacular “feat of arms.” It is for this type of\r\nstaff work that Staff Officers are sometimes rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF MESSINES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation at the end of April 1917 was a difficult one for the\r\nAllies. The failure to penetrate the Drocourt-Queant line had rendered\r\nthe whole plan of the British attack east of Arras abortive; this was\r\nbad enough, but indeed a minor incident when compared with the failure\r\nof the great French attack in Champagne. It was towards making good\r\nthis failure that the rest of the year’s operations had to be directed.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious plan of cutting off the Arras-Soissons-Reims salient\r\nhaving failed, the next blow was to be directed against the German\r\nright flank. The object of this attack was to drive this flank back\r\nsufficiently far to deprive the Germans of the coast line between\r\nNieuport and the Dutch frontier, and to render their position about\r\nLille sufficiently insecure to force them to evacuate it and so open\r\nthe road to Antwerp and Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of such an operation as this had long been\r\ncontemplated, and, as early as the summer of 1916, preparations for it\r\nhad been taken in hand by the British Second Army. By May 1917 these\r\nwere completed, including the construction of an extensive system of\r\nrailways in the Ypres area and the mining of most of the western flank\r\nof the Messines-Wytschaete ridge.\r\n\r\nThe operation was to be divided into two main phases, firstly the\r\ntaking of the Messines-Wytschaete ridge so as to secure the right\r\nflank of the second phase and to deny the enemy important points of\r\nobservation, and secondly the attack north of this ridge with the\r\nobject of occupying the coast line and of pushing forward towards\r\nGhent. The first phase constituted the battle of Messines, the subject\r\nof this chapter, and the second the Third Battle of Ypres.\r\n\r\nIt had been foreseen early in the year that such an attack was\r\npossible, and that in all probability tanks would be called upon to\r\ntake part in it, consequently, as early as March 1917, reconnaissances\r\nof the whole of the Ypres area had been taken in hand by the Heavy\r\nBranch. In April this surmise proved correct, and the 2nd Brigade,\r\nconsisting of A and B Battalions, was selected for this operation. In\r\nMay these two battalions were equipped with thirty-six Mark IV tanks\r\neach.\r\n\r\nRailheads were selected at Ouderdom and at Clapham Junction (one mile\r\nsouth of Dranoutre), and though they were within the shelled area,\r\nthey fulfilled most of the requirements demanded of a tank railhead.\r\nAdvanced parties began arriving at these stations on May 14, and\r\nbetween May 23 and 27, A and B Battalions followed them. Supply dumps\r\nwere then formed, and arrangements were made to carry forward one\r\ncomplete fill for all tanks operating by means of Supply Tanks, which\r\nwere first used in this battle. These tanks consisted of discarded Mark\r\nI machines with specially made supply sponsons fitted to them.\r\n\r\nThe positions of assembly were selected quite close to railheads, B\r\nBattalion tanks being hidden away in a wood, and A Battalion’s in\r\nspecially built shelters representing huts. The spoor left by the\r\ntanks, as they moved to these positions, was obliterated by means of\r\nharrows so that no enemy’s aeroplane happening to cross over our lines\r\nthis way would notice anything suspicious on the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF MESSINES\r\n\r\nJune 7th 1917.]\r\n\r\nThe object of the Second Army’s operations was firstly to capture the\r\nMessines-Wytschaete ridge and secondly to capture the Oosttaverne line,\r\na line of trenches running north and south a mile to a mile and a half\r\neast of the ridge. Three Corps were to participate in this attack--the\r\nXth and IXth Corps, and the IInd Anzac Corps. To these Corps tanks were\r\nallotted as follows: 12 tanks to the Xth Corps, 28 tanks to the IXth\r\nCorps, 16 for the ridge, and 12 for the Oosttaverne line, and 32 tanks\r\nto the IInd Anzac Corps, 20 for the ridge and 12 for the Oosttaverne\r\nline. Each battalion had two spare tanks and 6 supply tanks. The\r\ntotal number of tanks used was, therefore, 76 Mark IV tanks and 12 Mark\r\nI and II Supply Tanks.\r\n\r\nThe tank operations were planned to be entirely subsidiary to the\r\ninfantry attack, in fact the whole attack, being limited to a very\r\nshort advance, was based on the power of our artillery and the moral\r\neffect produced by exploding some twenty mines simultaneously at zero\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks the weather had been dry and fine, and had this not\r\nbeen the case, there would have been little hope of ever being able\r\nto move the tanks forward over the pulverised ground. The artillery\r\nbombardment opened on May 28, June 7 being fixed for the attack. It was\r\na terrific cannonade, watching it from Kemmel hill or the Scherpenberg,\r\nto-day almost blasted out of recognition themselves, one could see the\r\nGrand bois, Wytschaete wood, and the green fields along the valleys\r\nof the Steenbeek and Wytschaetebeek being slowly converted into a\r\ndun-coloured area which the first heavy fall of rain would convert into\r\na porridge of mud. Some shells as they exploded would throw up great\r\nfan-shaped masses of debris and smoke, others would burst into vortex\r\nrings, whilst others again shot up into the air great feathers of fine\r\nbrown dust. Day and night the bombardment continued except for a short\r\npause now and then to mislead the enemy as to the hour the infantry\r\nwould “top the parapet.”\r\n\r\nAt zero hour (dawn) 40 tanks were launched; of these 27 reached the\r\nfirst infantry objective, known as the Blue Line, and, of these 27, 26\r\nwent on to the second objective, the Black Line, and 25 reached it.\r\n\r\nThe artillery bombardment and creeping barrage proved so effective\r\nthat few of these tanks were ever called upon to come into action\r\nexcept round the ruins of Wytschaete village, where some snipers\r\nand machine-guns were silenced by them, and at Fanny's farm, near\r\nMessines, where our infantry were held up by machine-gun fire. One\r\ntank operating with the Anzac Corps got across the enemy's trenches\r\nat a very rapid rate and reached its objective on the Black Line, a\r\ndistance of about 3,000 yards, in 1 hour and 40 minutes, having engaged\r\nan enemy’s machine-gun on the way. Another tank, rather aptly named the\r\n“Wytschaete Express,” led the infantry into the village of Wytschaete\r\nand helped to persuade the Germans defending it to surrender, which\r\nthey did in large numbers.\r\n\r\nAt 10.30 a.m. the 24 reserve tanks were moved up to points behind our\r\noriginal front line, and 22 of these started with the infantry at 3.10\r\np.m. in the attack on the Oosttaverne line, which constituted the final\r\nobjective. During this phase of the battle the tanks rendered very\r\ngreat assistance to the infantry by occupying the ground beyond the\r\nOosttaverne line before the infantry arrived, and so disorganising the\r\nenemy’s defence.\r\n\r\nAt a place named Joye farm an interesting incident occurred. Two tanks\r\nbecame ditched here, but, in spite of this and approaching darkness,\r\nthese machines were in a position to repel any hostile counter-attack\r\ncoming up the Wambeke valley, so it was decided to stand by in the\r\ntanks and resume unditching work at daybreak.\r\n\r\nAt about 4 a.m. unditching was started again, and one tank was got\r\nout successfully, but unfortunately broke its track soon afterwards\r\nin trying to cross the railway to advance against an enemy’s\r\ncounter-attack which was developing. An hour later the enemy was\r\nobserved to be massing in the Wambeke valley. The position of the tanks\r\nonly allowed of a pair of 6-pounders being trained in the direction\r\nof the enemy, so the remainder of the crews, under their officers,\r\ntook up positions in shell-holes with their Lewis guns. Word was sent\r\nto the infantry to warn them and ask for co-operation, and on a reply\r\nbeing received that they were short of Lewis-gun ammunition, some was\r\nsupplied to them from the tanks.\r\n\r\nFrom 6.30 a.m. onwards the enemy made repeated attempts to advance,\r\nshooting at the tanks with a large number of armour-piercing bullets\r\nwhich failed to penetrate. They were driven off in every case with\r\nheavy casualties, until at 11.30 a.m. our artillery barrage opened and\r\ndispersed them.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Messines, one of the shortest and best mounted limited\r\noperations of the war, was in no sense a tank battle. Tanks took but\r\na small part in it, except in its final stages, nevertheless many\r\nuseful lessons were learnt, the chief of which were: the necessity of\r\nsome special form of unditching gear; the advisability of selecting\r\nstarting-points well behind our front line (in this battle they were\r\nchosen too close behind it, with the result that as it was still\r\ndark at zero hour several tanks got ditched in “No Man’s Land”); the\r\nadvisability of selecting rallying-points well behind objectives, so\r\nthat when tanks have finished their work their crews may gain as much\r\nrest as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA TACTICAL APPRECIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle of Messines may be looked upon as the high-water mark of\r\nthe artillery attack, which was first developed by the British Army\r\nduring the battle of the Somme. The time, however, was approaching when\r\na change of tactics became imperative on account of the enemy having\r\nlearnt his lesson. To appreciate what this question involves is of some\r\ninterest, especially so, as in the tank was eventually discovered a\r\nmeans of overcoming the counter-measures now adopted by the enemy.[24]\r\n\r\nThe main characteristic which differentiates the German defensive\r\ntactics of 1917 from those of 1916 would appear to lie in the grouping\r\nof their men rather than in the siting of their trenches.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the major portion of the German Army was placed in the frontal\r\ndefensive belt because security was sought for in the maintenance of an\r\nunbroken front. In 1917, however, this security was more economically\r\nguaranteed by holding behind this front, instead of in it, a large\r\nreserve which could strike at any opponent who broke through.\r\n\r\nThis reversion to the “big idea” and the abandonment of the smaller\r\none, namely, that war is a “series of local emergency measures,” placed\r\na further difficulty in the way of the attacker. In 1917 it was no\r\nlonger a question of breaking through a defensive line as in 1914, or\r\na zone of defences as in 1915 and 1916, but of exhausting the enemy’s\r\nreserves before undertaking either of these operations with decisive\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThis could now only be accomplished by hitting the enemy at a point\r\nwhich he must hold on to because of its importance or of surprising him\r\nat points where he did not expect to be attacked. If such points were\r\nnot selected all he need do was to fall back as he had already done in\r\nMarch, and so dislocate our operations, by temporarily denying us the\r\nuse of our guns.\r\n\r\nAs hitherto, the change we have always most carefully to watch for is\r\nany change the enemy is likely to carry out in his artillery tactics,\r\nand the following is apparently what the German was now doing.\r\n\r\nHaving learnt in 1916 and the first half of 1917 that if the attacker\r\nmakes up his mind to do it, he can carry, by means of artillery and\r\ninfantry alone, several lines of trenches in one bound, it stood to\r\nreason that the German General Staff would not continue to jeopardise\r\nits artillery by so placing it that it could be pounded to pieces\r\nduring our preliminary bombardment.\r\n\r\nIf now the Germans withdrew their guns further back to a position from\r\nwhich, though they cannot cover their front-line system, they can cover\r\ntheir second or third lines and simultaneously be immune, or to a great\r\nextent immune from our counter-battery fire, by accepting the loss of a\r\nsmall belt of ground they would place our attacking infantry in such a\r\nposition that whilst it feels the full effect of their artillery, it is\r\nreceiving next to no protection from its own.\r\n\r\nThe construction of their defensive systems in 1917 did not altogether\r\nlend itself to these tactics, the systems were too close together; but\r\nshould these distances be enlarged the disadvantage to the attacker\r\nbecomes apparent; and there were already signs that the Germans were\r\nfully aware of the advantage of this enlargement. At Arras they had\r\nbeen surprised in spite of the lengthy bombardment and they lost over\r\n200 guns, at Messines they lost 67, and later on at Ypres only 25, on\r\nthe first day of each attack. They were, in fact, countering by gun\r\nfire the exploitation of a penetration. This system of tactics can be\r\ngraphically illustrated as follows (see Diagram 16).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM 16.--GERMAN ARTILLERY TACTICS.]\r\n\r\nSuppose that AB be the German front-line system, and that CD, their\r\nsecond line, be so placed that the German guns at E can heavily shell\r\nthe whole of CD, and yet, on account of the distance away, remain\r\npractically immune from our guns at F. Suppose also that the area ABCD\r\nis strongly wired and well sprinkled with machine guns, who is going to\r\nsuffer most--the attackers from GH, who will not only be perpetually\r\nworried by the machine guns and sharpshooters in ABCD, but who will\r\ncome more and more under the enemy’s gun fire as they proceed towards\r\nCD, or the enemy’s machine gunners occupying ABCD, and his infantry\r\nin dug-outs along CD? Undoubtedly the former, for they present the\r\nlargest target, and against them is being thrown the greater number of\r\nprojectiles. Suppose now the attackers capture CD, then at best they\r\nwill only be able to remain there as impassive spectators to their\r\nown destruction until such time as the guns at F move forward, which,\r\non account of the “crumped area,” ABCD, will take many days. This is\r\nprobably what would have happened had the Second Army been required to\r\npush the attack from the Oosttaverne line towards Wervicq.\r\n\r\nExcept for an attack on an objective of very limited depth the\r\nartillery attack was almost doomed to fail on account of slowness of\r\nmoving forward the guns, due to the destruction of roads and terrain\r\nduring the initial bombardment. Bearing the above possibilities in\r\nmind, it was with some apprehension that the Heavy Branch watched the\r\napproach of the next great battle, for though the “crumped” area could,\r\nif dry, be crossed by tanks, whatever service they might afford would\r\nbe rendered useless on account of the impossibility of keeping the\r\nattacking infantry supplied; to do so, fleets of supply tanks would be\r\nrequired, and these did not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD BATTLE OF YPRES\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of May it was decided that all three Brigades\r\nof Tanks, that is, the whole Heavy Branch, should take part in the\r\nforthcoming operations of the Fifth Army east of Ypres, and that two\r\nof these brigades should assemble in Oosthoek wood and the third at\r\nOuderdom. To initiate preparations an advanced headquarters was opened\r\nat Poperinghe early in June, and on the 22nd of this month the brigade\r\nadvanced parties moved to the Ypres area.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Messines, the 2nd Brigade (A and B Battalions)\r\nhad assembled at Ouderdom, so the present concentration only involved\r\nmoving the 1st Brigade (D and G Battalions), and the 3rd Brigade (F and\r\nC Battalions) to Oosthoek. Seven trains were required for each of these\r\nBrigades.\r\n\r\nAt about this time it was decided that the 1st Brigade should be\r\nallotted to the XVIIIth Corps, the 3rd Brigade to the XIXth Corps, and\r\nthe 2nd Brigade to the IInd Corps; brigade commanders were, therefore,\r\ninstructed to place themselves in touch with these corps and commence\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nThe preparations required varied considerably from those for former\r\nbattles. The Ypres-Comines canal, running parallel to the front of\r\nattack, formed a considerable obstacle to tank movement; consequently,\r\ncauseways had to be built over the canal as well as over the Kemmelbeek\r\nand the Lombartbeek. This work was carried out by the 184th Tunnelling\r\nCompany, which was attached to the Heavy Branch for the purpose. The\r\nwork this unit carried out, normally under severe shell fire, was most\r\nefficient and praiseworthy. Besides the building of these causeways\r\nand the usual supply preparations, thoroughly efficient signalling\r\ncommunication was arranged for, including the use of a certain number\r\nof tanks fitted with wireless installations.\r\n\r\nThe reconnaissance work of the battalions was greatly facilitated\r\nby that already carried out by the advanced headquarters party.\r\nOblique aerial photographs were provided for each tank commander,\r\nand plasticine models of every part of the eventual battle area were\r\ncarefully prepared, the shelled zone being stencilled on them as the\r\nbombardment proceeded. To facilitate the movement of tanks over the\r\nbattlefield a new system was made use of by which a list of compass\r\nbearings from well-defined points to a number of features in the\r\nenemy’s territory was prepared, thus enabling direction to be picked up\r\neasily. The distribution of information was more rapid than it had been\r\non previous occasions. Constant discussions between the Brigade and\r\nBattalion Reconnaissance officers led to a complete liaison; in fact,\r\neverything possible was done to make the tank operations a success;\r\nfurther, there was ample time to do it in.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Army attack was to be carried out on well recognised lines;\r\nnamely, a lengthy artillery preparation followed by an infantry attack\r\non a large scale and infantry exploitation until resistance became\r\nsevere, when the advance would be halted and a further organised attack\r\nprepared on the same scale. This methodical progression was to be\r\ncontinued until the exhaustion of the German reserves[25] and moral\r\ncreated a situation which would enable a complete break-through to be\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nThe number of tanks allotted to the three attacking Corps was as\r\nfollows: seventy-two to each of the IInd and XIXth Corps, thirty-six\r\nto the XVIIIth, and thirty-six to be held in Army reserve. These were\r\nsubdivided according to objectives, namely:\r\n\r\n                     IInd Corps.  XIXth Corps.  XVIIIth Corps.\r\n  Black Line         16 tanks     24 tanks      12 tanks\r\n  Green Line         24   „       24   „        12   „\r\n  East of Green Line  8   „\r\n  Corps Reserve      24   „       24   „        12   „\r\n\r\nThe Corps objectives and the allotment of tanks to Divisions\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the IInd Corps the 24th and 30th Divisions supported by the 18th\r\nDivision were to attack on the right, and the 8th Division, supported\r\nby the 25th Division, on the left. The general objective of the\r\noperations was the capture of the Broodseinde ridge, and the protection\r\nof the right flank of the Fifth Army. The allotment of tanks to\r\nDivisions was: twelve to the 30th Division, eight to the 18th Division,\r\ntwenty-four to the 8th Division, and four to the 24th Division.\r\n\r\nIn the XIXth Corps the 15th Division was on the right and the 55th\r\nDivision on the left, with the 16th and 36th Divisions in reserve.\r\nThe objective of this Corps was to capture and hold a section of the\r\nenemy’s third-line system known as the Gheluvelt-Langemarck line.\r\nTwenty-four tanks were allotted to each of the attacking divisions.\r\n\r\nIn the XVIIIth Corps the 39th Division was on the right and the 51st\r\nDivision on the left, with the 11th and 48th Division in reserve. The\r\nmain objective was the Green Line; but should this be successfully\r\noccupied the 51st Division was to seize the crossings of the river\r\nSteenbeek at Mon du Rasta and the Military Road, and establish a line\r\nbeyond that river from which a further advance could be made on to the\r\nGheluvelt-Langemarck line; the 39th Division on the left conforming by\r\nthrowing out posts beyond the Green Line. Eight tanks were allotted to\r\nthe 51st Division and sixteen to the 39th Division.\r\n\r\nThe dead level of Northern Flanders is broken by one solitary chain\r\nof hills, a crescent in shape, with its cusps as Cassel and Dixmude.\r\nFrom Cassel to Kemmel hill had been ours since 1914; to this the\r\nMessines-Wytschaete ridge was added, as we have seen in June 1917;\r\nnow all that remained was the extension of this ridge northwards from\r\nabout Hooge to Dixmude. The territory lying within the crescent was\r\npractically all reclaimed swamp land, including Ypres and reaching back\r\nas far as to St. Omer, both of which, a few hundred years ago, were\r\nseaports. All agriculture in this area depended on careful drainage,\r\nthe water being carried away by innumerable dikes. So important was the\r\nmaintenance of this drainage system considered that in normal times a\r\nBelgian farmer who allowed his dikes to fall into disrepair was heavily\r\nfined.\r\n\r\nThe frontage of attack of the Fifth Army extended from the\r\nYpres-Comines canal to Wiltje cabaret. On the left the French were\r\nco-operating, attacking towards Houthulst forest, and on the right\r\nthe Second Army was restricted to an all but passive artillery rôle.\r\nThis frontage was flanked by two strong positions, the Polygonveld and\r\nHouthulst forest, which formed two bastions with a semicircular ridge\r\nof ground as a curtain between them; in front of this low curtain ran a\r\nbroad moat--the valley of the Steenbeek and its small tributaries.\r\n\r\nFrom the tank point of view the Third Battle of Ypres is a complete\r\nstudy of how to move thirty tons of metal through a morass of mud and\r\nwater. The area east of the canal had, through neglect and daily shell\r\nfire, been getting steadily worse since 1914, but as late as June 1917\r\nit was still sufficiently well drained to be negotiable throughout, by\r\nthe end of July it had practically reverted to its primal condition of\r\na vast swamp; this was due to the intensity of our artillery fire.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered at this time the only means accepted whereby to\r\ninitiate a battle was a prolonged artillery bombardment; sufficient\r\nreliance not as yet being placed in tanks on account of their\r\nliability to break down.[26] The present battle was preceded by the\r\nlongest bombardment ever carried out by the British Army, eight\r\ndays counter-battery work being followed by sixteen days intense\r\nbombardment. The effect of this cannonade was to destroy the drainage\r\nsystem and to produce water in the shell-holes formed even before the\r\nrain fell. Slight showers fell on the 29th and 30th, and a heavy storm\r\nof rain on July 31.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THIRD BATTLE OF YPRES\r\n\r\nJuly to November 1917.]\r\n\r\nA study of the ground on the fronts of the three attacking corps\r\nis interesting. On the IInd Corps front the ground was broken by\r\nswamps and woods, only three approaches were possible for tanks, and\r\nthese formed dangerous defiles. On the XIXth Corps front the valley\r\nof the Steenbeek was in a terrible condition, innumerable shell-holes\r\nand puddles of water existed, the drainage of the Steenbeek having\r\nbeen seriously affected by the shelling. On that of the XVIIIth Corps\r\nfront the ground between our front line and the Steenbeek was cut up\r\nand sodden. The Steenbeek itself was a difficult obstacle, and could\r\nscarcely have been negotiated without the new unditching gear which had\r\nbeen produced since the battle of Messines. The only good crossing was\r\nat St. Julien, and this formed a dangerous defile.\r\n\r\nZero hour was at 3.50 a.m., and it was still dark when the tanks, which\r\nhad by July 31 assembled east of the canal, moved forward behind the\r\nattacking infantry.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the attack on July 31, in spite of the fact that there are\r\nfifty-one recorded occasions upon which individual tanks assisted the\r\ninfantry, may be classed as a failure. On the IInd Corps front, because\r\nof the bad going, the tanks arrived late, and owing to the infantry\r\nbeing hung up, they were caught in the defiles by hostile artillery\r\nfire and suffered considerable casualties in the neighbourhood of\r\nHooge. They undoubtedly drew heavy shell fire away from the infantry,\r\nbut the enemy appeared to be ready to deal with them as soon as\r\nthey reached certain localities and knocked them out one by one. On\r\nthe XIXth Corps front they were more successful. At the assault on\r\nthe Frezenberg redoubt they rendered the greatest assistance to the\r\ninfantry, who would have suffered severely had not tanks come to their\r\nrescue. Several enemy’s counter-attacks were broken by the tanks, and\r\nSpree farm, Capricorn keep, and Bank farm were reduced with their\r\nassistance. On the XVIIIth Corps front at English trees and Macdonald’s\r\nwood several machine guns were silenced; the arrival of a tank at\r\nFerdinand’s farm caused the enemy to evacuate the right bank of the\r\nSteenbeek in this neighbourhood. The attack on St. Julien and Alberta\r\nwould have cost the infantry heavy casualties had not two tanks come\r\nup at the critical moment and rendered assistance. At Alberta strong\r\nwire still existed, and this farm was defended by concrete machine-gun\r\nemplacements with good dug-outs. The two tanks which arrived here went\r\nforward through our own protective barrage, rolled flat the wire and\r\nattacked the ruins by opening fire at very close range, with the result\r\nthat the enemy was driven into his dug-outs and was a little later on\r\ntaken prisoner by our infantry.\r\n\r\nThe main lessons learnt from this day’s fighting were--the\r\nunsuitability of the Mark IV tank to swamp warfare; the danger of\r\nattempting to move tanks through defiles which are swept by hostile\r\nartillery fire; the necessity for immediate infantry co-operation\r\nwhenever the presence of a tank forced an opening, and the continued\r\nmoral effect of the tank on both the enemy and our own troops.\r\n\r\nThe next attack in which tanks took part was on August 19, and in\r\nspite of the appalling condition of the ground, for it had now been\r\nsteadily raining for three weeks, a very memorable feat of arms was\r\naccomplished. The 48th Division of the XVIIIth Corps had been ordered\r\nto execute an attack against certain strongly defended works, and, as\r\nit was reckoned that this attack might cost in casualties from 600 to\r\n1,000 men, it was decided to make it a tank operation in spite of the\r\nfact that the tanks would have to work along the remains of the roads\r\nin place of over the open country. Four tanks were detailed to operate\r\nagainst Hillock farm, Triangle farm, Mon du Hibou, and the Cockcroft;\r\nfour against Winnipeg cemetery, Springfield, and Vancouver, and four\r\nto be kept in reserve at California trench. The operation was to be\r\ncovered by a smoke barrage, and the infantry were to follow the tanks\r\nand make good the strong points captured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II\r\n\r\nGROUND OPERATED OVER BY TANKS DURING THE BATTLE OF MESSINES, SHOWING\r\nPRELIMINARY BOMBARDMENT ON JUNE 5, 1917.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND OPERATED OVER BY TANKS IN AUGUST 1917, DURING THE\r\nTHIRD BATTLE OF YPRES.]\r\n\r\nEleven tanks entered St. Julien at 4.45 a.m., three ditched, and eight\r\nemerged on the St. Julien-Poelcappelle road, when down came the smoke\r\nbarrage, throwing a complete cloud on the far side of the objectives;\r\nat 6 a.m. Hillock farm was occupied, at 6.15 a.m. Mon du Hibou was\r\nreduced, and five minutes later the garrison of Triangle farm,\r\nputting up a fight, were bayoneted. Thus one point after another was\r\ncaptured, the tanks driving the garrisons underground or away, and the\r\ninfantry following and making good what the tanks had made possible. In\r\nthis action the most remarkable results were obtained at very little\r\ncost, for instead of 600 casualties the infantry following the tanks\r\nonly sustained fifteen!\r\n\r\nFrom this date on to October 9 tanks took part in eleven further\r\nactions, the majority being fought on the XVIIIth Corps front by the\r\n1st Tank Brigade. On August 22 a particularly plucky fight was put\r\nup by a single tank. This machine became ditched in the vicinity of\r\na strong point called Gallipoli, and, for sixty-eight hours on end,\r\nfought the enemy, breaking up several counter-attacks; eventually the\r\ncrew, running short of ammunition, withdrew to our own lines on the\r\nnight of August 24-25.\r\n\r\nOf the attacks which were made with tanks in the latter half of\r\nSeptember and the beginning of October, the majority took place along\r\nthe Poelcappelle road, the most successful being fought on October 4.\r\nOf this attack the XVIIIth Corps Commander reported that “the tanks\r\nin Poelcappelle were a decisive factor in our success on the left\r\nflank”; and their moral effect on the enemy was illustrated by the\r\nstatement of a captured German officer who gave as the reason of his\r\nsurrender--“There were tanks--so my company surrendered--I also.”\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to give any idea of the difficulty of these\r\nlatter operations or of the “grit” required to carry them out. Roads,\r\nif they could be called by such a name at all, were few and far between\r\nin the salient caused by the repeated attacks during the battle. This\r\nsalient had a base of some 20,000 yards and was only 8,000 deep at\r\nthe beginning of October, at which date the enemy could still obtain\r\nextensive observation over it from the Passchendaele ridge. The ground\r\nin between these roads being impassable swamps, all movement had to\r\nproceed along them, consequently they formed standing targets for the\r\nGerman gunners to direct their fire on. One night, at about this\r\nperiod of the battle, a tank engineer officer was instructed to proceed\r\nto Poelcappelle to superintend the demolition of some tanks which\r\nwere blocking the road near the western entrance to the village. His\r\ndescription of it at night-time is worth recording.\r\n\r\n  “I left St. Julien in the dark, having been informed that our guns\r\n  were not going to fire. I waded up the road, which was swimming\r\n  in a foot or two of slush, frequently I would stumble into a\r\n  shell-hole hidden by the mud. The road was a complete shambles and\r\n  strewn with debris, broken vehicles, dead and dying horses and\r\n  men. I must have passed hundreds of them as well as bits of men\r\n  and animals littered everywhere. As I neared Poelcappelle our guns\r\n  started to fire: at once the Germans replied, pouring shells on and\r\n  around the road, the flashes of the bursting shells were all round\r\n  me. I cannot describe what it felt like, the nearest approach of\r\n  a picture I can give is that it was like standing in the centre\r\n  of the flame of a gigantic Primus stove. As I neared the derelict\r\n  tanks, the scene became truly appalling: wounded men lay drowned\r\n  in the mud, others were stumbling and falling through exhaustion,\r\n  others crawled and rested themselves up against the dead to raise\r\n  themselves a little above the slush. On reaching the tanks I found\r\n  them surrounded by the dead and dying; men had crawled to them for\r\n  what shelter they would afford. The nearest tank was a female, her\r\n  left sponson doors were open, out of these protruded four pairs of\r\n  legs, exhausted and wounded men had sought refuge in this machine,\r\n  and dead and dying lay in a jumbled heap inside.”\r\n\r\nWhatever history may record of the Third Battle of Ypres, one fact\r\ncertainly will not be overlooked or forgotten, namely: that men who\r\ncould continue for three months to attack under the conditions which\r\ncharacterised this most terrible battle of the war must indeed belong\r\nto an invincible stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTANK MECHANICAL ENGINEERING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the “mechanical engineering” side of the Tank\r\nCorps constituted the backbone of the whole formation, for on its\r\nefficiency depended the efficiency of the fighting units in as high a\r\ndegree as the fighting efficiency of a cavalry regiment depends on its\r\nhorse-mastership.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter it is not intended to follow the growth of this\r\norganisation in detail, but rather to look back on its evolution\r\nas a whole, and then to enter upon a few particulars of the work\r\naccomplished by it. Before doing so it must be clearly understood that\r\nthe mechanical engineering side of the Tank Corps was as much a product\r\nof this Corps as the fighting organisation itself, as there was in the\r\nArmy no definite Mechanical Engineering Department to draw inspirations\r\nfrom. The nearest was the R.A.S.C., but a very wide gap separated the\r\nR.A.S.C. system from that adopted in the Tank Corps; both indeed dealt\r\nwith petrol engines, but the tank and its requirements are as distinct\r\nfrom the lorry as the lorry is from the aeroplane--another mechanical\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the experience of the engineering side of the Tank\r\nCorps, during the two years following its inception in August 1916, has\r\nbeen that the most efficient organisation depends upon the maintenance\r\nof two simple principles, namely:\r\n\r\n(i) No repairs to be carried out in the field--_i.e._ by fighting units.\r\n\r\n(ii) All maintenance to be carried out by the crews of the machines\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tank Corps was first formed, each Company of Tanks was\r\nprovided with its own workshops. At the end of 1916 Company Workshops\r\nwere abolished and Battalion Workshops were formed. Towards the end\r\nof 1917, after much consideration had been given to the question,\r\nBattalion Workshops were abolished and merged into Brigade Workshops,\r\nwhile a small number of skilled workshop men were left with each\r\nCompany. In 1918 it was realised that the gradual withdrawal of special\r\nworkshop facilities from the Company organisation to the Brigade had\r\nresulted in a considerable improvement in the skill and ability of\r\nthe tank crews themselves in the maintenance of their tanks. It was\r\ndecided, therefore, to go one step further, and not only withdraw all\r\nBrigade Workshops into a central organisation known as the Central\r\nWorkshops, but also to withdraw the special workshop men from the\r\nCompanies, while tank crews themselves were made entirely responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of their machines.\r\n\r\nIn this way it was possible to draw a clear line between maintenance\r\n(_i.e._ the replacing of damaged parts, which was done entirely by\r\nthe crews) and repairs (_i.e._ the mending of broken parts, which was\r\ndone entirely by the Central Workshops). At this time the argument was\r\nfrequently heard that a man who uses a machine should be able to repair\r\nit, and that, if all repair work is done by a different organisation\r\nfrom the one which actually fights the machine, there will be a serious\r\nloss of mechanical efficiency. This idea was based upon a misconception\r\nof the difference between the functions of repairs and maintenance. On\r\nthe contrary, it was found that the efficiency of the crews increased\r\nseveral hundred per cent. after the crews themselves were made\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of their machines. To carry out this\r\nsystem it is, however, necessary that stores and spare parts should be\r\nreadily available in the field; this entails an intelligent system of\r\nAdvanced Stores.\r\n\r\nOne very great advantage of this centralisation of repair work is the\r\nconsiderable saving in man-power effected by employing all skilled men\r\nexclusively on one particular job. As an example, broken unions of\r\npetrol pipes commonly occur in all petrol engines, and if a small unit\r\nworkshop exist, the brazing out and repair of such broken unions can\r\nbe carried out there. In order to do this a coppersmith must be kept\r\nat the unit workshop, and only part of his time will be employed in\r\nthis work of brazing petrol unions. If now, however, the unit workshops\r\nare abolished, and all broken unions, from every unit, are sent back\r\nto a Central Workshop for repair, there is a sufficient amount of\r\nwork of this description to keep one man, or possibly two or three,\r\nfully employed all their time. These men become absolute experts in\r\nbrazing broken unions, and before very long can do in a few minutes a\r\njob of this sort which would take a coppersmith with the unit workshop\r\nconsiderably longer.\r\n\r\nThe complete organisation for the maintenance and repair of tanks can\r\nbe briefly described by tracing the itinerary of a tank from the day\r\nit left the manufacturer until the day it was received at the Central\r\nWorkshops for repair.\r\n\r\nFrom the manufacturer the tank was first sent to the tank testing\r\nground at Newbury, which was manned and administered by No. 20\r\nSquadron, R.N.A.S. From here it was sent to Richborough and shipped\r\nacross the channel by channel ferry and received by another detachment\r\nof No. 20 Squadron at Havre. From Havre it was sent to the Bermicourt\r\narea, and after being put through further tests was handed over to the\r\nCentral Stores. The Central Stores were situated at the village of\r\nErin on the Hesdin-St.-Pol railway, and consisted of some seven acres\r\nof railway sidings and some six acres of buildings. These stores were\r\nbuilt in 1917, and at first included the Central Workshops; in 1918,\r\nhowever, these workshops were installed at Teneur, about a mile and a\r\nhalf away, and covered some twenty acres of ground.\r\n\r\nFrom the Central Stores tanks were issued to battalions, and after\r\nrepair at the Central Workshops were received again at these stores for\r\nreissue as they were required.\r\n\r\nAs the battalions carried out all their own mechanical maintenance,\r\nAdvanced Stores were instituted, these being sent out from the Central\r\nStores into the forward area immediately behind the front to be\r\nattacked by the tanks. These stores were organised on a very mobile\r\nfooting and proved invaluable in all battles since October 1917.\r\n\r\nBesides the moving forward of these Advanced Stores, Tank Field\r\nCompanies, originally known as Salvage Companies, were despatched from\r\nthe Central Workshops to the battle areas. The duty of these companies\r\nwas to take over from the fighting units all damaged tanks, such as\r\nthose knocked out by the enemy’s artillery fire; they were, in fact,\r\nthe clearers of the battlefield so far as tanks were concerned. Apart\r\nfrom salving complete tanks an immense quantity of other material was\r\nreclaimed, such as 6-pounder guns, machine guns, ammunition, tools,\r\ntrack plates, gears, transmissions, and engine parts, etc., which in\r\nthe two years of the existence of these companies totalled in value\r\nseveral millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nThe work carried out by the Tank Field Companies was particularly\r\ndangerous, and many casualties amongst their personnel occurred. In\r\nthe actual reclaiming of machines or parts they were constantly under\r\nshell fire, and the actual carrying to and fro of the material made use\r\nof required great physical strength, since the ground to be traversed\r\nwas frequently a mass of shell-holes; incidentally a great deal of work\r\nhad to be done at night since many of the machines to be salved were\r\nfrequently situated in full view of the enemy.\r\n\r\nFrom the Tank Field Companies the salved machines were sent to the\r\nCentral Workshops at Teneur. Here they were repaired, and this work\r\nentailed considerably more skill and labour than the initial assembly\r\nof the machines in the home factories on account of the shattered and\r\nburnt-out condition many of these machines were reduced to. Much of\r\nthis repair work was carried out by Chinese labour and at these shops\r\nover 1,000 Chinese were quartered for work, schools being instituted\r\nfor them so that mechanics, fitters, etc., could be trained.\r\n\r\nBesides testing and repairing machines much other work was carried\r\nout at the Central Workshops--“gagget” making, experiments, making\r\ngood minor deficiencies of manufacture and generally improving the\r\nmachines. This work frequently consisted in “panic” orders, such as the\r\nsledge and fascine making for the battle of Cambrai. One hundred and\r\nten tank sledges and 400 tank fascines, bundles of wood which will be\r\nmentioned later, when dealing with the battle of Cambrai, were ordered\r\non October 24, 1917. The former required some 3,000 cubic feet of wood,\r\nweighing 70 tons, and the latter 21,500 ordinary fascines, representing\r\nsome 400 tons of brushwood and over 2,000 fathoms of chain to hold them\r\ntogether. This order came on the top of a particularly strenuous period\r\nfollowing the tank operations round Ypres. At the same time another\r\norder for the overhaul and repair of 127 machines was made.\r\n\r\nOwing to the limited amount of time allowed for the transport of\r\nmaterial from the base ports to the Central Workshops and from the\r\nCentral Workshops to the forward area, extensive use was made of\r\nlorries. From November 10 to the 25th, twenty-eight lorries engaged\r\non this work covered a total of 19,334 miles, averaging 690 miles per\r\nlorry, while three box cars averaged 1,242 miles each.\r\n\r\nThe part played by the 51st Chinese Labour Company, attached to the\r\nWorkshops, materially contributed to the work being duly completed in\r\ntime for the battle. Owing to the necessity for secrecy the personnel\r\nof the Workshops were without knowledge of the immediate urgency of\r\nthe work they were engaged on. In spite of this all ranks worked with\r\nthe utmost enthusiasm, accomplishing the task in the required time.\r\nDuring these three weeks the Central Workshops were working 22½ hours\r\nout of every 24 without a break, and had it not been for the “grit”\r\ndisplayed by all ranks the battle of Cambrai could not have been\r\nfought, and without this battle the whole course of the war might have\r\nbeen changed; for it was the battle of Cambrai, as we shall shortly\r\nsee, which demonstrated the full power of the tank and which placed it\r\nhenceforth in the van of every battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD BATTLE OF GAZA\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the repulse sustained by the British forces at the\r\nSecond Battle of Gaza in April 1917, the troops operating were\r\nwithdrawn from their exposed position and the Tank Detachment was\r\nconcentrated in a fig grove some 2,000 yards west of Sheikh Nebhan, at\r\nwhich place it was later on reinforced by three Mark IV machines.\r\n\r\nA new plan of operations was drawn up in which the Turkish defences\r\nfrom Outpost hill to Ali El Muntar, which had resisted the combined\r\nonslaught of several divisions, was to be turned by an extensive\r\nflanking movement west of Gaza. This operation was to take place in\r\nconjunction with an attack on Beersheba.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of attack was as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) The Australian Corps and Desert Column were to operate from\r\nBeersheba north-westwards to Hareira.\r\n\r\n(ii) Several mounted and dismounted divisions were to operate around\r\nHareira and Gaza.\r\n\r\n(iii) A composite force of French, Italians and West Indian troops was\r\nto demonstrate by raids in the vicinity of Outpost hill.\r\n\r\n(iv) The XXIst Corps was to attack the enemy’s defences between\r\nUmbrella hill and the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is with the last of these four operations that this chapter is\r\nconcerned. For this attack the force detailed consisted of the 54th\r\nDivision, the Indian Cavalry Division, and the Tank Detachment--eight\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nThe attack of the 54th Division was divided into four phases--Blue,\r\nRed, Green, and Yellow.\r\n\r\nThe Tank Detachment left Deir El Belah on the night of October\r\n22-23, 1917, for the beach near Sheikh Ajlin. From here a thorough\r\nreconnaissance of the area of operations was carried out on horseback\r\nand by drifter, after which this area was divided into tank sectors. To\r\nthese tanks were distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) _156th Infantry Brigade._--Objective--Umbrella hill north-westwards\r\nto the eastern portion of El Arish redoubt. No. 1 tank was to support\r\nthe infantry in their attack on El Arish redoubt, deposit R.E. stores,\r\nattack Magdhaba trench and cover the infantry consolidation.\r\n\r\n(ii) _163rd Infantry Brigade._--Objective--El Arish redoubt northwards\r\nto south of Zowaiid trench. No. 2 tank was to attack El Arish redoubt,\r\nthen Island wood, deposit R.E. stores, and on the arrival of the\r\ninfantry take a southerly route and capture Crested rock.\r\n\r\n(iii) _161st and 162nd Infantry Brigades._--Objectives--Zowaiid trench\r\nto Sea Post and the Cricket valley northwards to Sheikh Hasan and 500\r\nyards beyond. For this operation four tanks were allotted.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 tank to attack Zowaiid trench, move north and capture Rafa\r\nredoubt, rally, then proceed along Rafa trench, deposit R.E. material,\r\ncapture Yunus trench, attack Belah trench until the arrival of\r\ninfantry, thence proceed to Sheikh Hasan, deposit more R.E. stores, and\r\nreturn to Sheikh Ajlin.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 tank to attack Rafa redoubt, co-operate with No. 3 tank against\r\nBelah trench, make for Sheikh Hasan, deposit R.E. material, attack A.6\r\n(an isolated Turkish trench to the north-east), and hold this until the\r\ninfantry had consolidated it.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 tank to capture Beach Post, co-operate in the assault on Cricket\r\nredoubt, attack Sheikh Hasan in advance of the infantry, and deposit\r\nR.E. material.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 tank to capture Sea Post, crush down the wire as far as Beach\r\nPost, assault Gun hill, proceed to Sheikh Hasan, then deposit R.E.\r\nstores and capture the Turkish post A.5.\r\n\r\n(iv) _Reserve Tanks._--Nos. 7 and 8 tanks were to be held in reserve\r\nnorth-east of Sheikh Ajlin; from there they were to follow up the\r\nattack and replace any disabled machine.\r\n\r\nIn all, the above six first-line machines had twenty-nine objectives\r\nto attack! That this could have been accomplished successfully would\r\nhave demanded a miracle; it was consequently foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of the attack was to consist in an infantry assault\r\nprotected by a creeping barrage; during this phase the tanks were to\r\nmove to their starting-points and be ready to advance at 3 o’clock on\r\nthe morning of November 2.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure complete co-operation between the Tank Detachment\r\nand the infantry, tank officers and other ranks were attached to\r\ninfantry brigades for ten days prior to the battle. As in France, this\r\nsystem resulted in the greatest benefit to both infantry and tank\r\npersonnel alike.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of the battle opened at 11 o’clock on the night of\r\nNovember 1-2, the 156th Infantry Brigade assaulting Umbrella hill. To\r\nthis attack the enemy did not respond immediately, but when he did he\r\nopened a heavy artillery fire all down his front which endangered the\r\nforward movement of the tanks to their starting-points, which, in spite\r\nof this, they reached half an hour before the second zero hour.\r\n\r\nIt had been hoped to make every use of the full moon which rose in\r\nthe early evening, but the smoke, resulting from the battle, and a\r\ndense haze restricted vision so completely that the tanks had to move\r\nforward on compass bearings. At 3 a.m. a heavy barrage was opened on\r\nthe enemy’s front-line system, behind which the tanks, followed by\r\nthe infantry, moved forward. No difficulty was experienced in dealing\r\nwith the first objective, as the Turks were evidently taken quite by\r\nsurprise. Under cover of the barrage our troops pushed on till they\r\napproached their second objective, when the enemy’s fire began to make\r\nitself felt. Along the coastline the attack proceeded according to\r\nprogramme, all objectives, including Sheikh Hasan, being taken. The\r\n161st and 163rd Brigades encountered considerable opposition at Rafa\r\ntrench, Island wood, Crested rock, Gibraltar, and north of El Arish\r\nredoubt. Briefly the operations carried out by the eight tanks of the\r\ndetachment were as follows:\r\n\r\nNo. 1 tank successfully attacked El Arish redoubt and was penetrating\r\nthe maze of trenches beyond, when owing to the darkness it was ditched;\r\nits crew then joined the infantry.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 tank assaulted El Arish redoubt and met a similar fate;\r\neventually it received a direct hit which broke its right track; its\r\ncrew also joined the infantry.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 tank attacked Rafa redoubt, and later on, losing direction in the\r\nmist, rallied.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 tank assaulted Rafa Junior, Yunus and Belah trenches, and after\r\ndepositing its R.E. material rallied.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 tank captured Sea Post, moved along the enemy’s trench, crushing\r\ndown the wire as far as Beach Post, attacked Cricket redoubt, Gun hill,\r\nand Tortoise hill, and reaching Sheikh Hasan deposited its R.E. stores.\r\nShortly after this it moved forward to attack A.5, but breaking a track\r\nit had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nNos. 7 and 8 tanks received instructions at 4 a.m. to support the\r\ninfantry attack on El Arish redoubt, and to proceed in this direction\r\nwith R.E. material. These machines were loaded up with empty sandbags\r\non the roof, these caught fire, probably through the heat of the\r\nexhaust pipe, both tanks went out of action.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the tank operations during the Third Battle of Gaza were\r\nof assistance to the infantry. All tanks, except one, reached their\r\nfirst objectives; four reached their second, third, and fourth, and one\r\nreached its fifth objective. Of the eight machines operating five were\r\ntemporarily disabled. Casualties in personnel were very light--only one\r\nman being killed and two wounded.\r\n\r\nThe Third Battle of Gaza closed the tank operations with the Army\r\nof Palestine, and though the damaged machines were repaired and put\r\ninto fighting trim they were not used again. In order to overcome the\r\ngreat difficulty in rounding up, by means of cavalry, the rearguard\r\ndetachments of the retiring Turkish Army, a mission was sent to France\r\nto obtain, if possible, a number of Whippet machines. This mission\r\nreached Tank Corps Headquarters in France on March 21, the day the\r\nGerman offensive was launched. All hope of procuring these machines\r\nconsequently vanished. The Tank Detachment, therefore, handed over\r\ntheir machines to the Ordnance Department at Alexandria and returned to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe tank operations in Sinai and Palestine conclusively proved that\r\ntanks could be employed almost anywhere in desert regions, and all that\r\nthey required were certain improvements in mechanism and changes in\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nWhat success the Tank Detachment won during its two years in the East\r\nwas due to the determination and fine fighting spirit displayed by its\r\nofficers and men, who laboured under the greatest difficulties, not the\r\nleast being the entire lack of knowledge displayed by the other arms\r\nin the limitations of tanks and their tactical employment. When all is\r\nsaid and done and every criticism rounded off, success with tanks in\r\nbattle is as much a matter of co-operation, that is, unity of action\r\nof all arms combined, as it is of mechanical fitness. This can only be\r\nattained by constant practice in combined exercises on the training\r\narea long prior to the battle even being thought of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nORIGINS OF THE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battles of 1914 were primarily infantry battles based on the power\r\nof the rifle, and it was not until 1915 that the quick-firing gun\r\nand the heavy howitzer began to replace the rifle as the reducers of\r\nresistance to the infantry attack.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, as far as the British Army is concerned, it may be said that\r\nartillery was generally looked upon as an adjunct to the infantry. This\r\nidea died hard, and it was not until the battle of the Somme was half\r\nway through that it became apparent that it was no longer a question\r\nof guns co-operating in the infantry advance, but of the infantry\r\nitself co-operating with the artillery bombardments. In other words\r\nthe limit of the infantry advance was the limit of the range of the\r\nguns, particularly the 18-pounders. This meant that no penetration of a\r\ngreater depth than about 4,000 yards could be effected unless a second\r\nechelon of guns and infantry was launched and brought into action\r\nsimultaneously with or just before the first assault had reached the\r\nrange limit of the guns which were supporting it.\r\n\r\nTwo factors prohibited this from being done; the first was the heavily\r\nshelled area which usually extends over the whole 4,000 yards of the\r\ninitial advance; the second, the great difficulty of keeping the second\r\nechelon of guns supplied with sufficient ammunition to maintain the\r\nsecond barrage. The shelled area not only prohibited the movement of\r\nguns for days, but produced such exhaustion on the second echelon of\r\ninfantry crossing it, that by the time it caught up with the first\r\nechelon its men were too fatigued to continue the attack.\r\n\r\nBy some it was hoped that the tank would partially overcome this\r\ndifficulty if it were brought into action on the area over which the\r\n18-pounder barrage was beginning to fail, and by producing a local\r\nbarrage of its own, by means of its machine guns, that it would cover\r\nany advance from 4,000 yards onwards.\r\n\r\nThis idea, though perfectly sound in itself, was doomed to failure as\r\nlong as the conditions of ground produced by artillery fire rendered it\r\nimpossible to support these tanks by infantry in fighting condition.\r\n\r\nThe first solution to this problem was to cease using heavy artillery\r\non ground to be traversed by the infantry attackers. This, however, is\r\nat best but a half measure, for though, in the present phase of the\r\nwar, co-operation between infantry and tanks was of vital importance,\r\nthis co-operation could not be maintained for long if one arm has to\r\nrely on its muscular power, whilst the other relies on petrol as its\r\nmotive force. At best, the advance of 4,000 to 6,000 yards will be\r\nextended to 8,000 or 12,000 yards, when the endurance of the infantry\r\nwill reach its limit and the advance automatically cease. This is not\r\nsufficient, for in a war such as was being waged in 1917 (a trench\r\nwar), in order to beat an enemy, the first necessity was to prevent him\r\nusing his spade. This can only be done by maintaining a continuous, if\r\ncomparatively slow advance, that is, by replacing muscle by petrol as\r\nthe motive force. This means the creation of a mechanical army.\r\n\r\nIn August 1917 the Tank Corps fully realised that the creation of\r\nsuch an army, even on a very small scale, would take at least a year;\r\nfurther, that its creation depended on the value of the tank being\r\nfully recognised by those who could create such an army, and upon this\r\narmy being used in a suitable area of operations. Consequently the\r\nfirst thing to do was to discover a suitable tank area; the second, to\r\nhold a tactical demonstration on it with tanks so as to convince the\r\nGeneral Staff of their power and value. These steps it was felt would\r\nhave to be taken before the petrol engine would be accepted as the\r\nmotive force of the modern battle.\r\n\r\nThe selection of a theatre of operations depends on the objective to\r\nbe gained; the gaining of the objective on the breaking down of the\r\nenemy’s resistance. Consequently the weapon which will most speedily\r\novercome this resistance must be considered first, and the area of\r\nattack in the theatre of operations chosen must be selected as far as\r\npossible with reference to its powers.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance we find that the chief resistance to our\r\ninfantry advance comes from the enemy’s machine guns. We dare not\r\nconcentrate all our artillery on these, for if we do, we shall release\r\nhis guns, which, free, can put up a stronger resistance than his\r\nmachine guns on account of their superior range. Further, whilst by\r\nsound and flash ranging and aeroplane observation we can discover his\r\nmain gun positions, no means have yet been discovered whereby his\r\nmachine guns can be located other than by advancing on them and risking\r\ncasualties. Tanks must, therefore, be employed to do this in order to\r\nclear the way for the infantry advance. Consequently, if sufficient\r\ntanks are forthcoming, in order to guarantee a decisive success, it is\r\nno longer a question of the tank as a spare wheel to the car, in case\r\nof an unforeseen puncture in our operations, but as the motive force of\r\nthe car itself, the infantry being merely its armed occupants; without\r\nwhich the car is valueless.\r\n\r\nThe area of operations selected must firstly be suitable to the rapid\r\nmovement of tanks, and secondly, unsuitable to hostile anti-tank\r\ndefences. Further, it should be chosen with reference to the tactical\r\ncharacteristics of this arm. Once chosen, all other weapons should be\r\ndeployed and employed to facilitate the advance of the tank, because\r\nit is to be used as the chief maintainer of infantry endurance, and it\r\nis the infantry man with his machine gun and bayonet who is going, for\r\nsome time to come, to decide the battle.\r\n\r\nSuch were the views held in the Tank Corps at the opening of the Third\r\nBattle of Ypres, and the following extract taken from a paper written\r\non June 11, 1917, is not only of interest but prophetic of future\r\nevents:\r\n\r\n  “If we look at a layered map of France we can at once put our\r\n  finger on the area to select. It lies between the Scarpe and the\r\n  Oise, the Flanders swamps in the north and the Ardennes in the\r\n  south-east. It was down this funnel of undulating country that\r\n  the Germans advanced in 1914, and it is up it that they will most\r\n  likely be driven if strategy is governed by ground and tactics by\r\n  weapons.”\r\n\r\nThe main area suitable for tank operations having been fixed upon\r\nby the Tank Corps, the next requirement was to select a definite\r\nobjective, the attack against which would draw the enemy’s reserves\r\ntowards it and so relieve the pressure which was being exerted against\r\nthe Fifth Army at Ypres. Two localities were considered, St. Quentin\r\nand Cambrai. The first was opposite the French area, the second\r\nopposite the British.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion put forward as regards the St. Quentin operation was\r\nabandoned on account of difficulties arising out of a British force\r\noperating in the French area; it must be remembered that at this time\r\nno real unity of command existed in France.\r\n\r\nThe Cambrai project consisted in a surprise raid, the duration of which\r\nwould be about twenty-four hours. The whole operation may be summed up\r\nin three words, “Advance, Hit, Retire.” Its object was to destroy the\r\nenemy’s personnel and guns, to demoralise and disorganise his fighting\r\ntroops and reserves, and not to capture ground or to hold trenches.\r\nIt was further considered that such an operation would interrupt his\r\n_roulement_ of reserves and make the enemy think twice as to replacing\r\nfresh divisions by exhausted and demoralised units in those parts of\r\nhis line which were not included in his battle front. Further, it would\r\nconfuse him as to the decisive point of attack; for any day one of\r\nthese raids might be followed by a strong offensive.\r\n\r\nThe actual area of operations selected was the re-entrant formed by\r\nthe L’Escaut or St. Quentin Canal between the villages of Ribecourt,\r\nCrèvecœur, and Banteux. The going in this area was excellent; further,\r\nthe area to be raided contained several fair-sized villages and\r\nimportant ground, and was well limited by the canal, which not only\r\nmade a rapid reinforcing of the area in the bend difficult, but\r\ncompletely limited the tank objectives.\r\n\r\nThe plan of attack was a threefold one:\r\n\r\n(i) To scour the country between Marcoing, Masnières, Crèvecœur, Le\r\nBosquet, Banteux.\r\n\r\n(ii) To form an offensive flank between Le Bosquet and Ribecourt.\r\n\r\n(iii) To form an offensive flank against Banteux.\r\n\r\nThe attack was to be launched at dawn, the first line of tanks\r\nmaking straight for the enemy’s guns, which before, and as the tanks\r\napproached them, were to be bombed by our aeroplanes. The second and\r\nthird lines of tanks were to follow, whilst our heavy guns commenced\r\ncounter-battery work and the shelling of the villages and bridges along\r\nthe canal. The essence of the entire operation was to be surprise\r\ncoupled with rapidity of movement. The spirit of such an enterprise is\r\naudacity, which was to take the place of undisguised preparation.\r\n\r\nIt must be realised that both the St. Quentin and Cambrai projects\r\nwere the home product of the Tank Corps, and they did not emanate\r\nfrom higher authority, which, when approached, was unable to sanction\r\neither. In spite of this, steps were taken to reconnoitre the Cambrai\r\narea, and for this purpose both the Brigadier-General commanding the\r\nTank Corps and the 3rd Tank Brigade Commander visited Sir Julian Byng,\r\nthe Third Army Commander, at his Headquarters in Albert. Though it is\r\nnot known whether the Third Army Commander had already considered the\r\npossibilities of an offensive on the front of his Army, in September it\r\nwould appear that he approached G.H.Q. on the subject, with the result\r\nthat still no action outside the Ypres area could be considered, anyhow\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF CAMBRAI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 20, the project, which had been constantly in the mind of\r\nthe General Staff of the Tank Corps for nearly three months and in\r\nanticipation of which preparations had already been undertaken, was\r\napproved of, and its date fixed for November 20.\r\n\r\nThe battle was to be based on tanks and led by them. There was to be no\r\npreliminary artillery bombardment; the day the Tank Corps had prayed\r\nfor, for nearly a year, was at last fixed, and its success depended on\r\nthe following three factors:\r\n\r\n(i) That the attack was a surprise.\r\n\r\n(ii) That the tanks were able to cross the great trenches\r\nof the Hindenburg system.\r\n\r\n(iii) That the infantry possessed sufficient confidence in\r\nthe tanks to follow them.\r\n\r\nThe following difficulties had to be overcome before these requirements\r\ncould be met. The tanks, on October 20, were scattered over a\r\nconsiderable area: some were at Ypres, others near Lens, and others\r\nat Bermicourt. These would all have to be assembled not at suitable\r\nentraining stations, as is usually the case, but at various training\r\nareas so that co-operative training with the infantry could take\r\nplace. This was of first importance, for success depended as much on\r\nthe confidence of the infantry in the tanks as on the surprise of the\r\nattack. At these training centres, tanks would have to be completely\r\noverhauled and fitted with a special device to assist them in crossing\r\nthe Hindenburg trenches, which were known, in many places, to be\r\nover 12 ft. wide, and the span of the Mark IV machine was only 10\r\nft. This device consisted in binding together by means of chains\r\nsome seventy-five ordinary fascines, thus making one tank fascine, a\r\ngreat bundle of brushwood 4½ ft. in diameter and 10 ft. long; this\r\nbundle was carried on the nose of the tank and, when a large trench\r\nwas encountered, was cast into it by pulling a quick release inside\r\nthe tank. As already described these tank fascines and the “fitments”\r\nnecessary to fix and release them were made by the Tank Corps Central\r\nWorkshops.\r\n\r\nBefore the infantry assembled for training a new tactics had to be\r\ndevised, not only to meet the conditions which would be encountered\r\nbut to fit the limitations imposed upon the tank by it being able to\r\ncarry only one tank fascine. Once this fascine was cast it could not be\r\npicked up again without considerable difficulty.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the tactics decided on were worked out to meet the following\r\nrequirements: “To effect a penetration of four systems of trenches in\r\na few hours without any type of artillery preparation.” They were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nEach objective was divided up into tank section attack areas, according\r\nto the number of tactical points in the objective, and a separate\r\nechelon, or line, of tanks was allotted to each objective. Each section\r\nwas to consist of three machines--one Advanced Guard tank and two\r\nInfantry tanks (also called Main Body tanks); this was agreed to on\r\naccount of there not being sufficient tanks in France to bring sections\r\nup to four machines apiece.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the Advanced Guard tank was to keep down the enemy’s fire\r\nand to protect the Infantry tanks as they led the infantry through the\r\nenemy’s wire and over his trenches. The allotment of the infantry to\r\ntanks depended on the strength of the objective to be attacked, and\r\nthe nature of the approaches; their formation was that of sections in\r\nsingle file with a leader to each file. They were organised in three\r\nforces: trench clearers to operate with the tanks; trench stops to\r\nblock the trenches at various points, and trench supports to garrison\r\nthe captured trench and form an advanced guard to the next echelon of\r\ntanks and infantry passing through.\r\n\r\nThe whole operation was divided into three phases: the Assembly, the\r\nApproach, and the Attack. The first was carried out at night time\r\nand was a parade drill, the infantry falling in behind the tanks on\r\ntape lines, connected with their starting-points by taped routes. The\r\nApproach was slow and orderly, the infantry holding themselves in\r\nreadiness to act on their own initiative. The Attack was regulated\r\nso as to economise tank fascines; it was carried out as follows. The\r\nAdvanced Guard tank went straight forward through the enemy’s wire\r\nand, turning to the left, without crossing the trench in front of it,\r\nopened right sponson broadsides. The Infantry tanks then made for the\r\nsame spot: the left-hand one, crossing the wire, approached the trench\r\nand cast its fascine, then crossed over the fascine and, turning to the\r\nleft, worked down the fire trench and round its allotted objective;\r\nthe second Infantry tank crossed over the fascine of the first and\r\nmade for the enemy’s support trench, cast its fascine, and, crossing,\r\ndid likewise. Meanwhile the Advanced Guard tank had swung round, and\r\ncrossing over the fascines of the two Infantry tanks moved forward with\r\nits own fascine still in position. When the two Infantry tanks met they\r\nformed up behind the Advanced Guard tank and awaited orders.\r\n\r\nIn training the infantry the following exercises were carried out:\r\n\r\n(i) Assembly of infantry behind tanks.\r\n\r\n(ii) Advance to attack behind tanks.\r\n\r\n(iii) Passing through wire crushed down by tanks.\r\n\r\n(iv) Clearing up a trench sector under protection of tanks.\r\n\r\nTo enable them to work quickly in section single files and to form from\r\nthese into section lines, a simple platoon drill was issued, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that this drill was based on a very similar one\r\ndescribed by Xenophon in his “Cyropædia” and attributed to King Cyrus\r\n(_circa_ 500 B.C.).\r\n\r\nWhilst training was being arranged by the Tank Corps General Staff the\r\nAdministrative Staff was preparing for the railway concentration, which\r\nwas by no means an easy problem.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of concentrating a large number of tanks in the area\r\nof operations was accentuated by the dispersion of the Tank Corps and\r\nthe shortage of trucks; this shortage was made good by collecting a\r\nnumber of old French heavy trucks; these, however, did not prove at all\r\nsatisfactory as they were too light. In spite of these difficulties\r\nthe whole of the units of the Tank Corps were concentrated in their\r\ntraining areas by November 5.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the most of the available truckage and the time\r\nattainable for infantry training, it was decided to concentrate\r\nthree-quarters of the whole number of tanks to be used, _i.e._\r\ntwenty-seven train loads, at the Plateau station by November 14 (Z-6\r\ndays); to move these to their final detraining stations on Z-4, Z-3,\r\nand Z-2 days; and to move the remaining quarter, _i.e._ nine train\r\nloads, from the training areas to the detraining stations on Z-5 day.\r\nThe detraining stations selected were Ruyaulcourt and Bertincourt for\r\nthe 1st Brigade, Sorel and Ytres for the 2nd Brigade, and Old and New\r\nHeudicourt for the 3rd Brigade. At all these stations detraining ramps\r\nand sidings were built or improved. In all, thirty-six tank trains were\r\nrun, and except for two or three minor accidents the move was carried\r\nout to programme. This was chiefly due to the excellent work of the\r\nThird Army Transportation Staff.\r\n\r\nSupply arrangements were divided under two main headings: supply by\r\nlight railways and supply in the field by supply tanks. The main dumps\r\nselected were at Havrincourt wood for the 1st Brigade, Dessart wood for\r\nthe 2nd, and Villers Guislain and Gouzeaucourt for the 3rd Brigade.\r\nA few of the items dumped were 165,000 gallons of petrol, 55,000 lb.\r\nof grease, 5,000,000 rounds of S.A.A., and 54,000 rounds of 6-pounder\r\nammunition. Without the assistance of the light railways this dumping\r\nwould hardly have been possible. On November 30 a S.O.S. call for\r\npetrol was made on Ruyaulcourt. A train was loaded, despatched 3½\r\nmiles, and the petrol delivered in just under one hour. This is a fair\r\nexample of the magnificent work consistently carried out by the Third\r\nArmy light railways during the battle of Cambrai.\r\n\r\nThe Third Army plan of operations was as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) To break the German defensive system between the canal St. Quentin\r\nand the canal Du Nord.\r\n\r\n(ii) To seize Cambrai, Bourlon wood, and the passages over the river\r\nSensée.\r\n\r\n(iii) To cut off the Germans in the area south of the Sensée and west\r\nof the canal Du Nord.\r\n\r\n(iv) To exploit the success towards Valenciennes.\r\n\r\nThis operation, for its initial success, depended on the penetration of\r\nall lines of defences, including the Masnières-Beaurevoir line, which\r\nin its turn depended on the seizing of the bridges at Masnières and\r\nMarcoing.\r\n\r\nThe force allotted for this attack was--two corps of three infantry\r\ndivisions each; the Tank Corps of nine battalions--378 fighting tanks\r\nand 98 administrative machines; a cavalry corps, and 1,000 guns.\r\n\r\nThe attack was to be carried out in three phases. In the first the\r\ninfantry were to occupy the line Crèvecœur, Masnières, Marcoing,\r\nFlesquières, canal Du Nord; the leading cavalry division was then to\r\npush through at Masnières and Marcoing, capture Cambrai, Paillencourt,\r\nand Pailluel (crossing over the river Sensée), and move with its right\r\non Valenciennes; whilst this was in progress the IIIrd Corps, which\r\nformed the right wing of the Third Army, was to form a defensive flank\r\non the line Crèvecœur, La Belle Etoile, Iwuy; the cavalry were then\r\nto cut the Valenciennes-Douai line and so facilitate the advance of\r\nthe IIIrd Corps in a north-easterly direction. The second and third\r\nphases were to be carried out by the IVth Corps, which formed the left\r\nwing of the Third Army, and were to consist firstly in opening the\r\nBapaume-Cambrai road and occupying Bourlon and Inchy, and secondly, in\r\nopening the Arras-Cambrai road and advancing on the Sensée canal and so\r\nto cut off the German forces west of the canal Du Nord.\r\n\r\nThe ground to be fought over consisted chiefly in open, rolling\r\ndownland, very lightly shelled, and consequently most suitable to\r\ntank movement. The main tactical features were the two canals which\r\npractically prohibited the formation of tank offensive flanks and\r\nso strategically were a distinct disadvantage to what was meant to\r\nbe a decisive battle. Between these two canals were two important\r\nfeatures--the Flesquières-Havrincourt ridge and Bourlon hill. A third\r\nvery important feature, known as the Rumilly-Seranvillers ridge, ran\r\nparallel to and north of the St. Quentin canal between Crèvecœur and\r\nMarcoing; without the occupation of this ridge a direct attack from\r\nthe south on Bourlon hill could only take place under the greatest\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe German defences consisted of three main lines of resistance and\r\nan outpost line: these lines were the Hindenburg Line, the Hindenburg\r\nSupport Line, and the Beaurevoir-Masnières-Bourlon line, the last being\r\nvery incomplete. The trenches for the most part were sited on the\r\nreverse slopes of the main ridges, and consequently direct artillery\r\nobservation on them from the British area was impossible. They were\r\nprotected by immensely thick bands and fields of wire arranged in\r\nsalients so as to render their destruction most difficult. To have\r\ncut these bands by artillery fire would have required several weeks\r\nbombardment and scores of thousands of tons of ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe weather had been throughout November fine and foggy, so much so\r\nthat aeroplane observation had been next to impossible. This foggy\r\nweather greatly assisted preparatory arrangements by securing them from\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nThe artillery preparations were as follows:--Over 1,000 guns of various\r\ncalibres were concentrated in the Third Army area for the attack. None\r\nof these, however, were permitted to register before zero hour. Briefly\r\nthe following was the artillery programme from zero hour on.\r\n\r\nAt zero the barrage was to open on the enemy’s outpost line; it was to\r\nconsist of shrapnel and H.E. mixed with smoke shells. It was to move\r\nforward by jumps of approximately 250 yards at a time, standing on\r\ncertain objectives for stated periods. Simultaneously with this jumping\r\nbarrage smoke screens were to be thrown up on selected localities,\r\nnotably on the right flank of the IIIrd Corps and on the Flesquières\r\nridge; counter-battery work was to open and special bombardments on\r\nprearranged localities such as bridgeheads, centres of communication,\r\nand roads likely to be used by the German reserves were to take place.\r\n\r\nTank Corps reconnaissances were started as early as secrecy would\r\npermit, but it was not until a few days before November 20 that\r\ncommanders were allowed to reconnoitre the ground from our front-trench\r\nsystem. Meanwhile at the Plateau station tanks were tuned up and tank\r\nfascines fixed. All detrainments were carried out by night, the tanks\r\nbeing moved up to their position of assembly under cover of darkness.\r\nThese positions were: Villers Guislain and Gouzeaucourt for the 3rd\r\nBrigade, Dessart wood for the 2nd Brigade, and Havrincourt wood for the\r\n1st Brigade. At these places tanks were carefully camouflaged.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF FIGHTING TANKS\r\n\r\n  ----+----+------+-----+-----+------+-----------+----------+------------\r\n  Tank|Tank|Corps.|Divn.|Bde. |No. of|Objective. | Exploit  |  Remarks.\r\n  Bde.| Bn.|      |     |     |Tanks.|           |towards-- |\r\n  ----+----+------+-----+-----+------+-----------+----------+------------\r\n  3rd | C  |  IV  |12th |35th | 24   |   Blue    |Crèvecœur |Number of\r\n  Bde.|    |      |     |     |  4[A]|           |          |tanks used\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |  „  |37th | 12   |   Brown   |          |for\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  2[A]|           |          |exploitation\r\n   „  | F  |   „  |  „  |36th | 24   |   Blue    |Masnières |varied\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  4[A]|           |          |according to\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |  „  |36th | 12   |   Brown   |          |condition of\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  2[A]|           |          |units after\r\n   „  | I  |   „  |20th |61st | 18   |Vacquerie  |Crèvecœur |gaining Blue\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  3[A]|           |          |and Brown\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |  „  | „   | 12   |   Blue    |          |Lines.\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  2[A]|           |          |\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |  „  |62nd |  6   |   Brown   |          |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  1[A]|           |          |\r\n   „  | A  |   „  |  „  |60th | 18   |   Blue    |Canal,    |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  3[A]|           |Masnières |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |      |           |to        |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  3[A]|           |Marcoing. |\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |  „  | „   |  6   |   Brown   |          |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  1[A]|           |          |\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |29th | „   | 12   |Rumilly to |          |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  2[A]|Nine wood  |          |\r\n  2nd | B  |   „  | 6th |16th | 24   |   Blue    |Marcoing. |\r\n  Bde.|    |      |     |     |  4[A]|           |          |\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |  „  | „   | 12   |   Brown   |          |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  2[A]|           |          |\r\n   „  | H  |   „  |  „  |71st | 24   |   Blue    |Nine wood |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  4[A]|           |          |\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |  „  | „   | 12   |   Brown   |          |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |  2[A]|           |          |\r\n  1st | D  |  III |51st |152nd| 42   |   Blue    |Fontaine  |1st Bde.\r\n  Bde.| E  |   „  |  „  |153rd| 28   |Flesquières|Bourlon   |used all\r\n      |    |      |     |     |      |           | wood,    |tanks in\r\n      |    |      |     |     |      |           |Bapaume-  |mechanical\r\n      |    |      |     |     |      |           |Cambrai   |reserve.\r\n      |    |      |     |     |      |           |road      |\r\n   „  | „  |   „  |62nd |186th| 14   |   Brown   |          |\r\n   „  | G  |   „  |  „  |185th| 42   |Havrincourt|Bourlon   |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |      |           |village,  |\r\n      |    |      |     |     |      |           |Graincourt|\r\n  ----+----+------+-----+-----+------+-----------+----------+------------\r\n\r\n  [A] In mechanical reserve, to replace breakdowns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF CAMBRAI\r\n\r\nNovember 20th 1917.]\r\n\r\nThe allotment of tanks to infantry units is given in the table on page\r\n146. Besides these, each Brigade had eighteen supply tanks or gun\r\ncarriers and three wireless-signal tanks. Thirty-two machines were\r\nspecially fitted with towing gear and grapnels to clear the wire along\r\nthe cavalry lines of advance; two for carrying bridging material for\r\nthe cavalry and one to carry forward telephone cable for the Third Army\r\nSignal Service. The total number of tanks employed was 476 machines.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 17-18 the enemy raided our trenches in the\r\nvicinity of Havrincourt wood and captured some of our men, and, from\r\nthe documents captured during the battle, it appears that these men\r\ninformed the enemy that an operation was impending; time wherein the\r\nGermans could make use of this was, however, so limited that the\r\nwarning of a possible attack only reached the German firing line a few\r\nminutes before it took place.\r\n\r\nThe following night, that of the 19th-20th, was broken by a sharp\r\nburst of artillery and trench-mortar fire which died away in the early\r\nmorning, and at 6 a.m. all was still save for the occasional rattle of\r\na machine gun. A thick mist covered the ground when at 6.10 a.m., ten\r\nminutes before zero hour, the tanks, which had deployed on a line some\r\n1,000 yards from the enemy’s outpost trenches, began to move forward,\r\ninfantry in section columns advancing slowly behind them. Ten minutes\r\nlater, at 6.20 a.m., zero hour, the 1,000 British guns opened fire, the\r\nbarrage coming down with a terrific crash about 200 yards in front of\r\nthe tanks which were now proceeding slowly across “No Man’s Land,” led\r\nby Brigadier-General H. J. Elles, the Commander of the Tank Corps, who\r\nflew the Tank Corps colours from his tank and who on the evening before\r\nthe battle had issued the following inspiring Special Order to his men:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special Order No. 6_[27]\r\n\r\n  1. To-morrow the Tank Corps will have the chance for which it has\r\n  been waiting for many months--to operate on good going in the van\r\n  of the battle.\r\n\r\n  2. All that hard work and ingenuity can achieve has been done in\r\n  the way of preparation.\r\n\r\n  3. It remains for unit commanders and for tank crews to complete\r\n  the work by judgment and pluck in the battle itself.\r\n\r\n  4. In the light of past experience I leave the good name of the\r\n  Corps with great confidence in their hands.\r\n\r\n  5. I propose leading the attack of the centre division.\r\n\r\n            HUGH ELLES,\r\n      _B.G. Commanding Tank Corps_.\r\n\r\n  _November 19, 1917._\r\n\r\nThe attack was a stupendous success; as the tanks moved forward\r\nwith the infantry following close behind, the enemy completely lost\r\nhis balance and those who did not fly panic-stricken from the field\r\nsurrendered with little or no resistance. Only at the tactical points\r\nwas opposition met with. At Lateau wood on the right of the attack\r\nheavy fighting took place, including a duel between a tank and a 5·9\r\nin. howitzer. Turning on the tank the howitzer fired, shattering and\r\ntearing off most of the right-hand sponson of the approaching machine,\r\nbut fortunately not injuring its vitals; before the gunners could\r\nreload the tank was upon them and in a few seconds the great gun was\r\ncrushed in a jumbled mass amongst the brushwood surrounding it. A\r\nlittle to the west of this wood the tanks of F Battalion, which had\r\ntopped the ridge, were speeding down on Masnières. One approached the\r\nbridge, the key to the Rumilly-Seranvillers position, upon the capture\r\nof which so much depended. On arriving at the bridge it was found that\r\nthe enemy had already blown it up, nevertheless the tank attempted to\r\ncross it; creeping down the broken girders it entered the water but\r\nfailed to climb the opposite side. Other tanks arriving and not being\r\nable to cross assisted the infantry in doing so by opening a heavy\r\ncovering fire. Westwards again La Vacquerie was stormed and Marcoing\r\nwas occupied. This latter village had been carefully studied beforehand\r\nand a definite scheme worked out as to where tanks should proceed\r\nafter entering it. Difficult though this operation was, each position\r\nwas taken up and the German engineers shot just as they were connecting\r\nup the demolition charges on the main bridge to the electric batteries.\r\n\r\nIn the Grand Ravin, which runs from Havrincourt to Marcoing, all was\r\npanic, and from Ribecourt northwards the flight of the German soldiers\r\ncould be traced by the equipment they had cast off in order to speed\r\ntheir withdrawal. Nine wood (Bois des Neuf) was stormed, and Premy\r\nChapel occupied. At the village of Flesquières the 51st Division,\r\nwhich had devised an attack formation of its own, was held up; it\r\nappears that the tanks out-distanced the infantry or that the tactics\r\nadopted did not permit of the infantry keeping close enough up to the\r\ntanks. As the tanks topped the crest they came under direct artillery\r\nfire at short range and suffered heavy casualties. This loss would\r\nhave mattered little had the infantry been close up, but, being some\r\ndistance off, directly the tanks were knocked out the German machine\r\ngunners, ensconced amongst the ruins of the houses, came to life\r\nand delayed their advance until nightfall; thus Flesquières was not\r\nactually occupied until November 21.\r\n\r\nIn the village of Havrincourt some stiff fighting took place. All\r\nobjectives were, however, rapidly captured, and the 62nd Division had\r\nthe honour of occupying Graincourt before nightfall, thus effecting\r\nthe deepest penetration attained during the attack on this day. From\r\nGraincourt several tanks pushed on towards Bourlon wood and the Cambrai\r\nroad, but by this time the infantry were too exhausted to make good any\r\nfurther ground gained.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile No. 3 Company of A Battalion had assisted the 29th Division\r\non the Premy Chapel-Rumilly line, one section of tanks working towards\r\nMasnières and another co-operating with the infantry in the attack\r\non Marcoing and the high ground beyond. The third section attacked\r\nNine wood, destroying many machine guns there and at the village of\r\nNoyelles, which was then occupied by our infantry.\r\n\r\nWhilst these operations were in progress the supply tanks had moved\r\nforward to their “rendezvous,” the wireless-signal tanks had taken\r\nup their allotted position, one sending back the information of the\r\ncapture of Marcoing within ten minutes of our infantry entering this\r\nvillage; and the wire-pullers cleared three broad tracks of all wire so\r\nthat the cavalry could move forward. This they did, and they assembled\r\nin the Grand Ravin and in the area adjoining the village of Masnières.\r\n\r\nBy 4 p.m. on November 20, one of the most astonishing battles in all\r\nhistory had been won and, as far as the Tank Corps was concerned,\r\ntactically finished, for, no reserves existing, it was not possible to\r\ndo more than rally the now very weary and exhausted crews, select the\r\nfittest, and patch up composite companies to continue the attack on\r\nthe morrow. This was done, and on the 21st the 1st Brigade supported\r\nthe 62nd Division with twenty-five tanks in its attack on Anneux and\r\nBourlon wood and the 2nd Brigade sent twenty-four machines against\r\nCantaing and Fontaine-Notre-Dame, both of which villages were captured.\r\n\r\nNovember 21 saw, generally speaking, the end of any co-operative action\r\nbetween tanks and infantry; henceforth, new infantry being employed,\r\nloss of touch and action between them and the tanks constantly\r\nresulted. Nevertheless on the 23rd a brilliant attack was executed by\r\nthe 40th Division, assisted by thirty-four tanks of the 1st Brigade;\r\nthis resulted in the capture of Bourlon wood. The tanks then pressed\r\non towards the village; the infantry, however, who had suffered severe\r\ncasualties in the capture of the wood, were not strong enough to secure\r\na firm footing in it.\r\n\r\nThis day also saw desperate fighting in the village of\r\nFontaine-Notre-Dame. Twenty-three tanks entered this village in advance\r\nof our own infantry; there they met with severe resistance, the enemy\r\nretiring to the top stories of the houses and raining bombs and\r\nbullets down on the roofs of our machines. Our infantry, who were very\r\nexhausted, were unable to make good the ground gained, consequently,\r\nall tanks which were able to do so withdrew under cover of darkness at\r\nabout 7 p.m.\r\n\r\nOn November 25 and 27 further attacks were made by tanks and infantry\r\non Bourlon and Fontaine-Notre-Dame with varying success, but eventually\r\nboth these villages remained in the hands of the enemy. So ends the\r\nfirst phase of the battle of Cambrai.\r\n\r\nDuring the attacks which had taken place since November 21, tank units\r\nhad become terribly disorganised, and by the 27th had been reduced to\r\nsuch a state of exhaustion that it was determined to withdraw the 1st\r\nand 2nd Brigades. This withdrawal was nearing completion when the great\r\nGerman counter-attack was launched early on the morning of November 30.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate this attack, it must be remembered that at this time the\r\nIIIrd and IVth Corps were occupying a very pronounced salient, and that\r\nall fighting had, during the last few days, concentrated in the Bourlon\r\narea and had undoubtedly drawn our attention away from our right flank\r\neast of Gouzeaucourt. The plan of General von der Marwitz, the German\r\nArmy Commander, was a bold one, it was none other than to capture the\r\nentire IIIrd and IVth British Corps by pinching off the salient by\r\na dual attack, his right wing operating from Bourlon southwards and\r\nhis left from Honnecourt westwards, the two attacks converging on\r\nTrescault. Between these two wings a holding attack was to be made from\r\nMasnières to La Folie wood.\r\n\r\nThe attack was launched shortly after daylight on November 30,\r\nand failed completely on the right against Bourlon wood. Here the\r\nenemy was caught by our artillery and machine guns and mown down by\r\nhundreds. On the left, however, the attack succeeded: firstly, it\r\ncame as a surprise; secondly, the Germans heralded their assault by\r\nlines of low-flying aeroplanes which caused our men to keep well\r\ndown in their trenches and so lose observation. Under the protection\r\nof this aeroplane barrage and a very heavy mortar bombardment the\r\nGerman infantry advanced and speedily captured Villers Guislain and\r\nGouzeaucourt.\r\n\r\nAt 9.55 a.m. a telephone message from the IIIrd Corps warned the 2nd\r\nBrigade of the attack, but, in spite of the fact that many of the\r\nmachines were in a non-fighting condition, by 12.40 p.m. twenty-two\r\ntanks of B Battalion moved off towards Gouzeaucourt, rapidly followed\r\nby fourteen of A Battalion. Meanwhile the Guards Division recaptured\r\nGouzeaucourt, so, when the tanks arrived, they were pushed out as a\r\nscreen to cover the defence of this village. By 2 p.m. twenty tanks of\r\nH Battalion were ready, these moved up in support.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of December 1, in conjunction with the Guards\r\nDivision and 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions, the 2nd Brigade delivered\r\na counter-attack against Villers Guislain and Gauche wood. The western\r\nedge of the wood was cleared of the enemy; the tanks then proceeded\r\nthrough the wood, where very heavy fighting took place. From the\r\nreports received as to the large number of dead in the wood and the\r\nnumerous machine guns found in position, it is clear that the enemy had\r\nintended to hold it at all costs. Once the wood was cleared the tanks\r\nproceeded on to Villers Guislain, but being subjected to direct gun\r\nfire eventually withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe counter-attack carried out by the 2nd Brigade greatly assisted\r\nin restoring a very dangerous situation; it was a bold measure\r\nwell executed, all ranks behaving with the greatest courage and\r\ndetermination under difficult and unexpected circumstances and amidst\r\nthe greatest confusion caused by the success of the German attack;\r\nevery tank crew of every movable machine had but one thought, namely,\r\nto move eastward and attack the enemy. This they did, and it is a\r\nremarkable fact that, though at 8 a.m. on November 30 not one machine\r\nof the Brigade was in a fit state or fully equipped for action, by 6\r\na.m. on the following day no fewer than seventy-three tanks had been\r\nlaunched against the enemy with decisive effect.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first great tank battle in the whole history of warfare,\r\nand, whatever may be the future historian’s dictum as to its value, it\r\nmust ever rank as one of the most remarkable battles ever fought. On\r\nNovember 20, from a base of some 13,000 yards in width, a penetration\r\nof no less than 10,000 yards was effected in twelve hours; at the\r\nThird Battle of Ypres a similar penetration took three months. Eight\r\nthousand prisoners and 100 guns were captured, and these prisoners\r\nalone were nearly double the casualties suffered by the IIIrd and IVth\r\nCorps during the first day of the battle. It is an interesting point\r\nto remember that in this battle the attacking infantry were assisted\r\nby 690 officers and 3,500 other ranks of the Tank Corps, a little over\r\n4,000 men, or the strength of a strong infantry brigade, and that\r\nthese men replaced artillery wire-cutting and rendered unnecessary the\r\nold preliminary bombardment. More than this, by keeping close to the\r\ninfantry they effected a much higher co-operation than had ever before\r\nbeen attainable with artillery. When on November 21 the bells of London\r\npealed forth in celebration of the victory of Cambrai, consciously or\r\nunconsciously to their listeners they tolled out an old tactics and\r\nrang in a new--Cambrai had become the Valmy of a new epoch in war, the\r\nepoch of the mechanical engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nAN INFANTRY APPRECIATION OF TANKS\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the many battles and engagements in which the Tank Corps took\r\npart many appreciative special orders and letters were received from\r\nthe Higher Commanders under whose orders the Corps worked. These\r\nkindly words, always appreciated, are apt sometimes to be regarded\r\nas the inevitable “good chits” which courtesy demands should be\r\naddressed to good, indifferent, and bad alike after an operation has\r\nbeen successfully completed. Unsolicited testimonials, and especially\r\nsuch as are not meant for the eyes of those praised, when they do, by\r\nchance, come under these eyes, are regarded as more than mere “pats\r\non the back,” especially when they come from those who have fought\r\nalongside the commended.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written by an infantry officer who took part\r\nin the battle of Cambrai, and addressed to a personal friend neither in\r\nnor connected with the Tank Corps, who, months later on, showed it to\r\none who was. Not only did this letter come as a pleasant and gratifying\r\nsurprise to all ranks of the Corps, for it was published as a “Battle\r\nNote,”[28] but it shows such an exceptionally clear insight into the\r\nvalue and possibilities of the tanks that, even for this reason alone,\r\nit is worth publishing. Who the writer was the Tank Corps never knew,\r\nbut his sound judgment and kindly appreciation stimulated amongst\r\nhis readers that high form of personal and collective pride which to\r\nsoldiers is known as “esprit de corps.” It is on human documents such\r\nas these, rather than on orders and instructions, that the moral of\r\nan individual or a unit grows strong, and by growing strong places the\r\nentire Army one step nearer victory.\r\n\r\nThe letter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I will first give you the opinion of one of my colonels. In three\r\n  years of fighting on this front, I have met no battalion commander\r\n  to equal him in power of leadership, rapidity of decision in an\r\n  emergency, and personal magnetism. I have met no man who would\r\n  judge so justly what an infantry soldier _can_ and _cannot_ do.\r\n\r\n  “He considers the tanks _invaluable_ if properly handled, either\r\n  for the attack or in defence--but he realises, as I think we all\r\n  do, that until Cambrai, the tactical knowledge shown in their\r\n  employment was of the meanest order.\r\n\r\n  “One other valuable opinion I’ve obtained. We have now with the\r\n  Battalion a subaltern, a man of about thirty--a very good soldier,\r\n  a resolute, determined kind of fellow who has seen a good deal\r\n  of fighting. He commanded a platoon in our --th Battalion in\r\n  the big tank attack at Cambrai and was in the first wave of the\r\n  attack throughout. He tells me that the tanks covering the advance\r\n  of his battalion functioning under ideal weather and ground\r\n  conditions, were handled with marked skill and enterprise in the\r\n  capture of the first two objectives covering an advance of about\r\n  3,500 yards. The moral effect of the support given by tanks on\r\n  the attacking infantry is _very great_. He says his men felt the\r\n  utmost confidence in the tanks and were prepared to follow them\r\n  anywhere. The effect of the advancing line of tanks on the enemy\r\n  infantry was extraordinary. They made no attempt whatever to hold\r\n  their trenches, and either bolted in mad panic or, abandoning their\r\n  arms, rushed forward with hands uplifted to surrender. As long as\r\n  the advance of the tanks continued, _i.e._, over the enemy trench\r\n  system to a depth of from two to three miles, the total casualties\r\n  incurred by our --th Battalion (attacking in the first wave) were\r\n  four killed and five wounded, all by shell fire.\r\n\r\n  “After the fall of the second objective, the advance ceased\r\n  for some unexplained reason--(they were told some hitch about\r\n  Flesquières)--the attack seemed to lose purpose and direction.\r\n  Tanks on the flanks began coming back. The battalion was ordered\r\n  to attack five different objectives, and before the necessary\r\n  plans could be communicated to subordinate commanders, orders were\r\n  received cancelling the previous instructions. In a word, chaos\r\n  prevailed. The afore-mentioned subaltern cannot speak too highly of\r\n  the work of the tank commanders--nothing could exceed their daring\r\n  and enterprise. He says he is absolutely convinced that infantry,\r\n  unsupported by artillery, are absolutely powerless against tanks\r\n  and that no belt of wire can be built through which they cannot\r\n  break an admirable passage for infantry.\r\n\r\n  “Lastly, he makes no secret of the fact that it would demand the\r\n  utmost exercise of his determination and resolution to stand fast\r\n  and hold his ground in the face of an attack by enemy tanks,\r\n  carried out on the same scale as ours. I may add that he is a big\r\n  upstanding fellow, a fine athlete, and afraid of nothing on two\r\n  legs.\r\n\r\n  “I give you his opinion at some length, because they are the\r\n  _ipsissima verba_ of a man qualified to speak from personal\r\n  practical experience. Personally, I believe the tanks may yet play\r\n  the biggest rôle in the war, if only the Higher Command will employ\r\n  them in situations where common-sense and past experience alike\r\n  demand their use. Two days before the Hun attacked us at Bourlon\r\n  wood we lost three officers and some seventy gallant fellows trying\r\n  to mop up a couple of enemy M.G. nests--a bit of work a couple of\r\n  tanks could have done _with certainty_ without the loss of a man.\r\n\r\n  “In the situation described after the capture of the second\r\n  objective, why should there not have been a responsible staff\r\n  officer--G.S.O.1 say--right forward in a tank to size up the\r\n  situation and seize opportunity, the very essence of which is rapid\r\n  decision? In the early days of the war, forgetful of the lessons of\r\n  South Africa, we put our senior officers in the forefront of the\r\n  battle--of late, the pendulum has swung the other way--surely the\r\n  employment of a tank for the purpose outlined would enable us now\r\n  to strike the happy mean?\r\n\r\n  “In defence, as a mobile ‘pill-box,’ the possibilities of the tank\r\n  are great--any man who has led infantry ‘over the top’ knows the\r\n  demoralising and disorganising effect of the ‘surprise packet’\r\n  machine-gun nest--what more admirable type of nest can be devised?\r\n  Continually changing position, hidden from enemy aircraft by smoke\r\n  and the dust of battle, offering no target for aimed artillery fire.\r\n\r\n  “Half the casualties we suffer in heavy fighting after the initial\r\n  attack come from the carrying parties winding slowly in and out\r\n  through barrage fire, bringing up ammunition to the infantry, the\r\n  Lewis and Vickers guns--all this could be done much more rapidly,\r\n  surely, with a minimum of loss, by tanks--for the future the tank\r\n  should relieve the artillery of all responsibility as regards\r\n  wire-cutting. You _know_ you can cross a belt of wire over which\r\n  a tank has passed, you _hope_ you can pass through a wire belt on\r\n  which the artillery has played for a couple of days. As a business\r\n  proposition a tank at £5,000 will cut more wire in one journey,\r\n  even assuming it does nothing else, than 2,000 shells at £5 each,\r\n  blazing away for a day--add the wear on the life of the gun.\r\n\r\n  “In attack, one of the most difficult problems of the infantry\r\n  is to get the Stokes guns far enough forward, with sufficient\r\n  ammunition, to come into action against machine guns or strong\r\n  points holding up the advance unexpectedly--all this could be done\r\n  by means of a tank with ease--whilst not only could the small\r\n  Stokes gun with a range of 500-600 yards be brought forward, but\r\n  also the 6 in. Stokes with a range of 1,200-1,600 yards by the same\r\n  means, and be brought into action firing from the tank.\r\n\r\n  “The tank has only one enemy to fear--the high-velocity tank gun,\r\n  firing aimed shots from forward positions. I believe this danger\r\n  can be minimised by means of escort aeroplanes attached during an\r\n  action to every tank, and provided with smoke bombs to blind the\r\n  gun position, if unable to silence the gun by machine-gun fire or\r\n  by means of ordinary bombs heavily charged.\r\n\r\n  “I have tried to outline some of the more obvious uses for which\r\n  the tank is so admirably suitable. There is a well of this\r\n  information yet untapped, not in staff offices, but in the minds\r\n  of the platoon and company commanders who have fought in the first\r\n  waves of the attack with the tank, who have seen the difficulties\r\n  it has to overcome and how it has met them or failed, and why.\r\n  Nothing has yet been produced in this war to equal the tank for\r\n  doing by _machinery_ what has hitherto been done by _men_; nothing\r\n  so well fitted to economise our man-power and reduce the appalling\r\n  wastage which has hitherto characterised our efforts in attack, and\r\n  with gain instead of loss in efficiency.\r\n\r\n  “We want thousands of tanks, both light and heavy, ranging from\r\n  two miles to eight miles per hour, armed with M.G.s, armed with\r\n  Stokes guns, unarmed and fast-travelling for transport of gun teams\r\n  to emergency tactical positions, and lastly, a staff of trained\r\n  minds to define the tactics of the tank--to refute criticism based\r\n  on ignorance, to collect, classify and investigate all available\r\n  information and suggestions, so that like an aeroplane--every ‘new\r\n  edition’ of the tank is an improvement on the last.\r\n\r\n  “I have written at some length, but the subject is big and\r\n  attractive enough to be my excuse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE TANK CORPS TRAINING CENTRE\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in February 1916 a Conference was held at the War Office, to\r\ndecide as to the training of the personnel for the tank units it was\r\nnow decided to raise. At this Conference, Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton\r\nand Lieutenant-Colonel R. W. Bradley, D.S.O., were ordered to be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Lieutenant-Colonel Bradley was Commandant of the Motor\r\nMachine Gun Training Centre at Bisley, and was in the position to\r\nselect suitable men for the new arm.\r\n\r\nThe number of men required for the first 150 tanks was estimated at\r\n1,500, or ten men for each machine, and 150 junior officers. This\r\npersonnel was obtained as follows: 600 men were transferred from the\r\nreserves in training at the Motor Machine Gun Training Centre and 900\r\nwere obtained by special enlistment. Thirty officers were transferred\r\nfrom the Motor Machine Gun Section, fifteen were detailed by G.H.Q.,\r\nFrance, and the remainder were obtained by calling for volunteers from\r\nunits in England and by special selection from Cadet units.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of secrecy the new formation was “tacked on” to the\r\nMachine Gun Corps and was christened with the terrific name of:\r\n“Special Armoured Car Section Motor Machine Gun Section.” A month later\r\nit became known as the Heavy Section Machine Gun Corps.\r\n\r\nThe recruiting was very successful, and this was largely due to the\r\nuntiring energy of Mr. Geoffrey Smith, editor of _The Motor Cycle_, who\r\nspared neither time, trouble, nor money in getting the men.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of March the training camp was moved from Bisley to\r\nBullhouse farm, and at this camp all elementary training was carried\r\nout, recruits being taught drill, the ways of military life, and the\r\nVickers and Hotchkiss machine guns as well as the Hotchkiss 6-pounder.\r\n\r\nThe first establishment issued by the War Office provided for 10\r\ncompanies of 10 tanks each, but within a fortnight this was changed\r\nto 15 companies of 10 tanks each, the companies being grouped in 3\r\nbattalions. A little later this organisation, at the request of G.H.Q.,\r\nFrance, was again changed to one of 6 companies of 25 tanks each.\r\n\r\nWith a further view of ensuring secrecy it was arranged by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Swinton that no tanks should be sent to Bisley,\r\nbut that a training ground, far removed from prying eyes, should be\r\nsecured. Steps were at once taken to find such a ground, and eventually\r\nThetford in Norfolk was visited and Lord Iveagh’s estate at Elveden\r\nselected. The necessary training ground here was taken over and was\r\nknown as “the Elveden Explosives Area”; and round it at 200 yards\r\nintervals were posted groups of sentries of the Royal Defence Corps.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of April a certain amount of grumbling on the\r\npart of specially enlisted men occurred at Bisley. They had been\r\ninduced to join an Armoured Car Service, and for six weeks they had\r\nnot even seen the wheel of a car. They were asked to exercise a little\r\npatience and were promised a surprise. At Elveden the surprise was\r\nrevealed to them, and when they had got over their astonishment on\r\nseeing the first Mark I tank approach them they set down to work with\r\na will, which, it is an honour to record, was never abandoned by all\r\nranks of the Tank Corps from this day on to the conclusion of the war.\r\n\r\nThe camp at Elveden was placed just outside the “Explosives Area”\r\nand no one was allowed to enter the area without a special permit.\r\nCompanies, before they proceeded overseas, however, spent their last\r\nthree weeks within the area. As soon as this necessary ground had been\r\ntaken over, three pioneer battalions were brought to Elveden Camp and a\r\ncomplete series of trenches was dug on a front of a mile and a quarter,\r\nand to the depth of two miles. The plan of this work was laid out by\r\nMajor Tandy and Captain Martel, both R.E. officers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, on account of delay in delivery of tanks, constructional\r\ndefects and repeated requests from G.H.Q., France, that all available\r\ntanks and crews should be sent out to France for the September\r\noperations on the Somme, little use was made of these trenches, for\r\ntactical training. Machine-gun firing from tanks with ball ammunition\r\nwas, however, freely carried out, and also 6-pounder practice which,\r\nunfortunately, was much hampered by danger restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe tank drivers were all drawn from the A.S.C., and the 711th Company\r\nA.S.C. was formed to include these men, the workshops, and the M.T.\r\npersonnel of the Heavy Section. The officer in command of this company\r\nand in charge of all mechanical instruction and driving was Major H.\r\nKnothe, D.S.O., M.C.\r\n\r\nBy the end of May the last company had completed its training at Bisley\r\nand had moved to Elveden; the headquarters, having some time prior to\r\nthis, moved to this place and established itself in the stables of Lord\r\nIveagh’s mansion and in the new almshouses in Elveden village.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of July training was sufficiently advanced to give\r\nthe first tank demonstration ever held. Twenty tanks took part in it\r\nand advanced in line followed by infantry against a section of the\r\ninstructional trench system. The demonstration was a great success and\r\nmany notable persons witnessed it, including Mr. Lloyd George and Sir\r\nWilliam Robertson.\r\n\r\nThis demonstration was shortly afterwards followed by a second at which\r\nthe King attended. His Majesty was most anxious that his projected\r\nvisit should be kept secret, but as it was nevertheless necessary\r\nto make certain preparations it was given out at the camp that a\r\nvery distinguished Russian general was about to visit the tanks. The\r\nidentity of the Russian general was, however, discovered by the bulk of\r\nthe men before the demonstration was concluded, much to their pleasure\r\nand amusement.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of August Lieutenant-Colonel Brough, C.M.G.,\r\nvisited G.H.Q., France, to ascertain the tactics it was proposed to\r\nemploy as regards tanks. Unfortunately his visit was fruitless, for\r\nno ideas apparently existed on the subject. Shortly after his return\r\ninstructions were received to dispatch the tank companies to France,\r\nand to decide on this a conference was held at which the following\r\nofficers were present: Major-General Butler, Brigadier-General\r\nBurnett-Stuart, both from G.H.Q., France; Lieutenant-Colonel Swinton,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Bradley, and Lieutenant-Colonel Brough. At this\r\nConference it was decided to mobilise the companies at Elveden and to\r\ndispatch them overseas by half companies. The first to leave was C\r\nCompany and the second D Company, which, respectively, were under the\r\ncommands of Majors Holdford-Walker and Summers.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of August Colonel Swinton was instructed to send over\r\nto France a staff officer, but as the establishments only allowed of a\r\ncommander and one staff captain, and as the latter was a very junior\r\nofficer, Lieutenant-Colonel Brough was sent over. Shortly after his\r\narrival he found it necessary to wire home for motor-cars, clerks,\r\netc., for he had been ordered to take over command of the units in\r\nFrance. Captain Kingdon was thereupon sent out to assist him, and\r\ntwo clerks and a motor-car were also dispatched. By these means were\r\nextemporised an advanced headquarters, the original headquarters of the\r\nHeavy Branch remaining in England and never proceeding overseas.\r\n\r\nIn October 1916, as already related in Chapter VI, Bovington Camp,\r\nWool, was selected as the new training centre. Here E, F, G, H, and I\r\nBattalions were raised and trained during 1916-1917, and J, K, L, M, N,\r\nO, P, Q, and R during 1917-1918, the last battalion, the 18th, sailing\r\nfor France in September 1918.\r\n\r\nIn 1917, to cope with the steadily increasing number of tank units of\r\nall descriptions, Worgret Camp, Wareham, and Lulworth were taken over,\r\nthe Depot Reserve Unit being established at the former and the Gunnery\r\nCamp at the latter place.\r\n\r\nThe first schools to be formed were the Tank Drivers’ School, the\r\n6-Pounder School, and the Lewis Gun School, but by degrees, as the Tank\r\nCorps grew, these developed until at the close of the war the following\r\nschools had been established:\r\n\r\n  Tank Drivers and Maintenance School.\r\n  Tank Gunnery School (6-Pounder and Machine Gun).\r\n  Tank Reconnaissance School.\r\n  Tank Signal and Pigeon School.\r\n  Camouflage School.\r\n  Revolver School.\r\n  Gas School.\r\n  Tank Compass School.\r\n\r\nIn July 1918 the preparations set on foot to double the Tank Corps for\r\n1919 threw a great deal of work on to the Training Centre. Thirteen\r\nBritish, three Canadian, and one New Zealand Battalion were to be\r\nraised, as well as a number of subsidiary units. In August, in spite\r\nof shortage of infantry reinforcements, an allotment, given precedence\r\nover all the other arms, of 4,500 men, was made to the Tank Corps\r\nTraining Centre, so that the raising of the above new units might\r\nforthwith begin; besides this, nearly half a million pounds worth\r\nof buildings were sanctioned without estimates being called for, so\r\nimportant was it now considered that not a day should be lost in the\r\nTank Corps preparations for 1919.\r\n\r\nBy the date of the armistice about half the building programme was\r\nfinished, and eight British and one Canadian battalion had been raised.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the total number of tank units and\r\nreinforcements raised and trained at the Training Centre between\r\nNovember 1916 and November 1918.\r\n\r\n  British Tank Battalions          22  (5th to 26th).\r\n  Canadian Tank Battalions          1  (1st Canadian Tank Battalion).\r\n  American Tank Battalions          3  (301st, 302nd, and 303rd).\r\n  Gun Carrier Companies             2  (1st and 2nd).\r\n  Tank Supply Companies             5  (1st to 5th).\r\n  Tank Advanced Workshops           2  (Nos. 4 and 5).\r\n  Tank Salvage Companies            1  (No. 3).\r\n  American Tank Salvage Companies   2  (306th and 317th).\r\n  Various Headquarters              3\r\n                                  ---\r\n      Total Tank Units raised      41\r\n\r\nThe whole of the above units, with the exception of eight British and\r\none Canadian Battalion, were sent out to France prior to the armistice.\r\n\r\nIn all, some 21,000 officers and men passed through the Training\r\nCentre, 14,000 in formed units, and 7,000 as reinforcements; besides\r\nthese, 950 cadets were trained. In October 1918 the Training Centre,\r\nwhich from one camp at Bovington had grown to include Worgret,\r\nLulworth, and Swanage Camps, had on its strength in all ranks and\r\nservice approximately 16,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe time required wherein to raise and train a new Tank Battalion\r\naveraged four months. The system of instruction adopted from November\r\n1916 onwards was to start with a very thorough individual training\r\nand then to pass the recruits through the various schools, leaving\r\ncollective and tactical training to be carried out in France.\r\n\r\nRecreational training played an important part in the above\r\ninstruction, and the Training Centre gained a considerable reputation\r\nin the Southern Command for efficiency in sports and games.\r\n\r\nIn the expansion which commenced on September 1, 1918, 30 per cent. of\r\nthe personnel for each new unit was sent to the Training Centre from\r\nthe trained Tank Corps personnel in France, and this trained personnel,\r\ntogether with the increased numbers of training tanks and other\r\nimproved facilities, would have gone far to effect a more efficient\r\nand rapid training of the units, before their departure overseas, than\r\nheretofore.\r\n\r\nBesides raising and training new units and reinforcements the Tank\r\nCorps Training Centre was intimately connected with much of the\r\nexperimental work, armament design, and the fittings of all types of\r\ntanks from the introduction of the Mark V and Medium “A” tanks onwards.\r\nThe following were the main improvements initiated.\r\n\r\nThe adaptation of the Hotchkiss machine gun to the tank.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the Palmer machine-gun battle-sight.\r\n\r\nThe invention of fire-control instruments.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer of 1917 various experiments were carried\r\nout at Wool to arrive at the best method of demolishing and removing\r\nwire entanglements. Eventually grapnels were decided upon and were used\r\nwith great success in November at the battle of Cambrai.\r\n\r\nThe use of cloud smoke from tanks was also originated at the Training\r\nCentre, and with the aid of an invention of the late Commander Brock\r\nwas eventually adopted for all tanks, and was used on several occasions\r\nwith effect during the summer and autumn operations of 1918.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of general interest and education as well as for the\r\nconversion of the mechanical heathen, a considerable number of\r\ndemonstrations, showing the power of tanks and their co-operation\r\nwith infantry, were given to officers of the War Office, Commands and\r\nSchools throughout 1918. On October 25 this year, His Majesty the King\r\nvisited Wool to witness one of these, and paid the Tank Corps Training\r\nCentre the great honour of inspecting the various battalions, and\r\nwelcomed many of the men of the British and American units assembled by\r\nwalking amongst them and conversing freely with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE TANK SUPPLY COMPANIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTanks, like every other arm of the Army, require a highly organised\r\nsupply service, and being cross-country machines they must be served by\r\nmachines of similar powers of locomotion. This was probably realised\r\nbefore tanks were originally dispatched to France in 1916, but, during\r\nthe battles of the Somme, Ancre, and Arras, it was not possible to\r\norganise any system of cross-country supply on account of every machine\r\nbeing required for either fighting or training purposes. In February\r\n1917 the first organisation for cross-country supply was formulated.\r\nThis consisted in allotting two supply tanks to each company, but the\r\ndelay in the arrival of Mark IV machines prevented this organisation\r\ntaking form until May 1917.\r\n\r\nSupply tanks were first employed at the battle of Messines, the Mark I\r\ntanks, which had now been discarded as fighting machines, being used\r\nfor this purpose. These machines were fitted with large soft steel\r\nsponsons made at the Tank Corps Central Workshops. During this battle\r\nthey were not much used owing to the limited scope of the operations.\r\n\r\nBetween June 1917 and the opening of the Third Battle of Ypres each\r\ntank battalion received six supply tanks, two for each company, but\r\nduring this battle they did not prove a success on account of the\r\nappalling conditions of the ground, the sponsons continually becoming\r\nwedged in the shell-holes, which necessitated much digging out to\r\nrelieve them.\r\n\r\nJust prior to the opening of this battle the first of the gun-carrier\r\ntanks arrived in France, and was dispatched to Flanders and attached to\r\nthe XVIIIth Corps for experiment. Later on others followed, until by\r\nthe end of the year forty-four of these machines had been received.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the gun-carrier was that of mechanical artillery, the\r\nmachine being really a mechanical gun mounting capable of carrying a\r\n60-pounder or 6 in. howitzer. Its total shell capacity without the gun\r\nwas 200 6 in. shells, weighing approximately 10 tons.\r\n\r\nConsidering the difficulties of the ground very good work was done by\r\nthe gun-carriers during the Ypres operations, several hundreds of tons\r\nof ammunition being carried forward as well as a few 60-pounders.\r\n\r\nIn September a new method of supply was experimented with; this\r\nconsisted in towing behind any type of tank three sledges connected\r\nwith the roof of the machine by a cable. At the battle of Cambrai this\r\nmethod proved a great success, and not only were tank supplies hauled\r\nforward but also telegraph cable and bridging material.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn and winter of 1917 much careful thought had been\r\ndevoted both in France and England to the question not only of tank\r\nsupply but of being able to carry forward infantry, particularly\r\nmachine-gunners, in armoured carrier tanks; the result of this was the\r\ndesign of a large carrier tank known as the Mark IX and the raising of\r\na new unit known as an “Infantry Carrier Company.”\r\n\r\nThese carrier units were first formed on February 1, 1918. The first\r\ntwo companies consisted mostly of Royal Engineer personnel, and the\r\nnext three of infantry. The standard of the personnel was very good,\r\nabout 60 per cent. having already seen service overseas. The 1st\r\nand 2nd Companies proceeded to France about the middle of May, the\r\nremaining three arriving in June and July.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of each of these companies was as follows:\r\n\r\n  A company headquarters and four sections, each section consisting\r\n  of six Mark IV supply tanks, or tenders, as they were sometimes\r\n  called. The object of these companies was laid down in Tank Corps\r\n  Standing Orders as follows:\r\n\r\n  “The Tank Supply Company is a unit of Brigade Troops for the\r\n  carriage of supplies, from the point where wheeled vehicles cease,\r\n  to battalions. The responsibility for maintaining battalion\r\n  supplies rests with Brigade Headquarters. The duties of the Brigade\r\n  Supply Officer will in no way be shared by the O.C. Tank Supply\r\n  Company. The Tank Supply Company will be used as a mobile reserve\r\n  of supplies under the immediate control of Brigade Headquarters.”\r\n\r\nThese supply companies were never used for carrying forward infantry,\r\nas the Mark IX tank did not materialise until October 1918; they\r\nproved, however, of the greatest use during all the tank operations of\r\nthe last year of the war.\r\n\r\nDuring June the two Gun Carrier Companies were definitely converted\r\ninto Supply Companies and were attached to the 3rd and 5th Brigades. At\r\nthe battle of Hamel, on July 4, four of these machines did excellent\r\nwork, carrying forward between twenty and twenty-five tons of R.E.\r\nmaterial and dumping this a few hundred yards behind the final\r\nobjective within half an hour of this objective being captured. These\r\nmachines were driven by four officers and sixteen men, and had the\r\nmaterial they transported been brought up by carrier parties at least\r\n1,200 men would have been required; in man-power alone these four\r\nmachines thus saved 1,184 soldiers, or approximately two infantry\r\nbattalions at battle strength.\r\n\r\nOn arrival in France the 1st and 2nd Supply Companies were posted to\r\nthe 1st and 4th Tank Brigades, and the 3rd, 4th, and 5th were sent to\r\nBlingel Camp, in the Bermicourt area, where good facilities existed for\r\ntank driving and maintenance. At about the end of July the 3rd and 5th\r\nCompanies were equipped with Mark IV supply tanks, and female Mark IV\r\nmachines fitted with a sledge equipment.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of August the distribution of the various supply units\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n  No. 1 Gun Carrier Company      5th Tank Brigade.\r\n  No. 2 Gun Carrier Company      3rd Tank Brigade.\r\n  No. 1 Tank Supply Company      1st Tank Brigade.\r\n  No. 2 Tank Supply Company      4th Tank Brigade.\r\n  No. 3 Tank Supply Company      Blingel Camp.\r\n  No. 4 Tank Supply Company      2nd Tank Brigade.\r\n  No. 5 Tank Supply Company      Blingel Camp.\r\n\r\nAll these companies, less No. 1 Tank Supply Company and No. 2 Gun\r\nCarrier Company, took part in the battle of Amiens.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 Gun Carrier Company suffered an unfortunate experience on August\r\n7. It had moved forward to an orchard on the western side of Villers\r\nBretonneux, each of its machines being loaded up with explosives of\r\nvarious kinds. A shell fired from a German battery in the vicinity of\r\nChipilly set fire to one of the camouflage nets, and the result of\r\nthis was that though six out of the twenty-two machines got away the\r\nremaining sixteen were blown up, the explosion being terrific.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd Tank Supply Company was allotted to the Canadian Corps to carry\r\nforward infantry supplies such as grenades, S.A.A., and drinking water.\r\nThe female Mark IV. tanks equipped with sledges were attached to the\r\nCanadian Engineers for the purpose of bringing forward material in\r\norder to repair the bridges over the Luce river. Owing to weak cables\r\nthis operation proved a failure, most of these machines breaking down\r\nbefore they had covered a mile.\r\n\r\nThe policy which was first adopted of attaching a section of six supply\r\ntanks to each battalion did not work well, the Company Headquarters\r\nwas usually left in the air, and soon lost touch with its sections. In\r\norder to remedy this defect from August 9 onwards company commanders\r\nwere instructed to establish “report centres” well in advance of the\r\nbattlefield. These centres were “baited” by sending the mails there;\r\nto obtain news from home it was consequently necessary for section\r\ncommanders to send runners in to fetch them; by this means touch with\r\nthe Company Headquarters was automatically maintained.[29]\r\n\r\nIn the battles north of the Somme, commencing on August 21, much\r\nuseful work was carried out, the tank-drivers having by now become\r\nthoroughly expert in driving and maintenance. The sections were now\r\nproperly brigaded, each company being looked upon as a unit and not\r\nas a mere headquarters for four separate units. Proper telephonic\r\ncommunication was now established between the sections and the company,\r\nand consequently much time was saved not only within the company itself\r\nbut by the various units it was supplying.\r\n\r\nDuring all the battles onwards from August 8 to the capture of\r\nLandrecies the work carried out by the Tank Supply Companies and the\r\nGun Carrier Companies was not only useful but of great importance, as\r\nin many places the roads were too bad for mechanical transport. When\r\nthey were not required to bring forward tank supplies they were engaged\r\nin carrying every sort of ammunition and engineer stores, especially\r\nthrough zones which were harassed by machine-gun fire and in which, had\r\ninfantry carrying parties been used, many lives would have been lost.\r\n\r\nWhen the possibilities of these companies became realised, infantry\r\ncommanders were continually asking for their assistance, preference\r\nbeing given to the gun-carriers on account of their greater capacity\r\nfor light stores.\r\n\r\nThe Gun Carrier Companies, besides doing excellent work as infantry\r\nsupply companies, kept both field and heavy artillery well supplied.\r\nNo. 2 Gun Carrier Company carried out some very successful heavy\r\nsniping by carrying forward a 6 in. howitzer, and by moving it from\r\nplace to place during the night it both harassed and puzzled the\r\nenemy. Besides this, several successful gas attacks were carried out\r\nwith the aid of the gun-carriers, which transported the projectors and\r\nbombs to positions over country which wheeled transport could not have\r\nnegotiated. By using these machines it was possible to get in three or\r\nmore “shoots” in one night and to retire out of the danger zone before\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nIf in the days of the great Napoleon, when a soldier went into action\r\nwith frequently less than twenty balls in his pouch and a couple of\r\nspare flints, an Army “crawled on its stomach,” how much more does\r\nit crawl to-day! When the lessons of the war are sorted and tabulated\r\nin order of importance, very near the top, if not at the top itself,\r\nwill be found that of “road capacity,” in other words, that victory\r\nrests with the side which can maintain the broadest communications.\r\nTo widen existing roads directly by enlarging them or to construct\r\nnew roads are both works of great labour; they absorb not only time\r\nand men but also transport of every kind, especially in a country\r\nlike north-eastern France, where suitable stone for road-metalling is\r\npractically non-existent. To do so indirectly is best accomplished by\r\na cross-country tractor, that is, by a machine which can move on or\r\noff a road. With such a machine roads can be indefinitely widened;\r\nparadoxically they cease to exist, for they are no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nThe tank is, first of all, a cross-country tractor, and it is curious\r\nthat none of the contending nations appear to have appreciated this\r\nuntil well towards the end of the war, in spite of the fact that the\r\nreason for the general slowness of the advances which followed any\r\ninitial success was nearly always due to inadequacy of supply.\r\n\r\nBy the end of March 1918 the German attack “petered out” for want\r\nof supplies; by the end of May it again did likewise for a similar\r\nreason. Had the Germans possessed on March 21 and May 27 5,000 to 6,000\r\nefficient cross-country tractors, each of which could have carried five\r\ntons of supplies, all the hosts of brave men, which the United States\r\nof America could have poured into France, could not have prevented a\r\nseparation of the British and French Armies from being effected. Had\r\nsuch a separation taken place it is impossible to say what the result\r\nmight not have been; but what is possible to say is that had the\r\nGermans “scrapped” half their guns and replaced them by cross-country\r\ntractors they would have gone nearer winning the war than they did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BATTLE OF THE SOMME\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the close of the battle of Cambrai the British Army abandoned\r\nthe offensive, which had been initiated on April 9, and a period of\r\npassive defence was developed. At this time all three Tank Brigades\r\nhad assembled at or near Bray-sur-Somme, where extensive hutments\r\nexisted and where the old devastated area offered excellent facilities\r\nfor training. Towards the end of December a request was made by the\r\nTank Corps to establish at Bray a large tank and infantry school, so\r\nthat co-operation between these two arms might be secured; further, as\r\nartillery ranges were near at hand it was felt that a complete tactical\r\nunity of action between tanks, infantry, artillery, and aeroplanes\r\ncould now be established: besides this, Bray formed an excellent\r\nstrategical centre to the Somme area should the Germans at any time\r\nlaunch an attack between the Oise and the Scarpe.\r\n\r\nEarly in January 1918 orders were, however, received that in place of\r\nremaining assembled at one spot the Tank Corps was to form a defensive\r\ncordon stretching from about Roisel to a little south of Bethune--a\r\nfrontage of some sixty miles. In February this line was taken up, tank\r\nunits being distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Fifth Army, 4th Tank Brigade            1st Bn. Doingt wood.\r\n    „    „    H.Q. Templeux La Fosse      4th Bn. Buire wood.\r\n    „    „                                5th Bn. Buire wood.\r\n  Third Army, 2nd Tank Brigade            2nd Bn. Velu wood.\r\n    „    „    H.Q. Thilloy                8th Bn. Fremicourt.\r\n    „    „                                10th Bn. Fremicourt.\r\n    „    „    3rd Tank Brigade            6th Bn. Wailly.\r\n  G.H.Q. Reserve, H.Q. Henincourt         3rd Bn. Bray.\r\n    „    „                                9th Bn. Bray.\r\n    „    „        5th Tank Brigade        13th Bn. Bray (unequipped).\r\n    „    „        H.Q. Bray.\r\n  First Army, 1st Tank Brigade            7th Bn. Boyeffles.\r\n    „    „    H.Q. Bois d’Olhain          11th Bn. Bois des Alleux.\r\n    „    „                                12th Bn. Bois de Verdrel.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that by this date the Tank Corps had grown from three\r\nto five brigades, in all thirteen battalions; machines, however, were\r\nshort, and the total fighting strength in tanks at this time was only\r\n320 Mark IV and 50 Medium A Tanks (Whippets) fit for action.\r\n\r\nThe general plan was that tank units should co-operate with Army and\r\nCorps reserves in the deliberate counter-attack against tactical\r\npoints in what was known as the battle zone, a belt of ground running\r\nseveral miles in rear of and parallel to the forward or outpost zone;\r\nno retirement from this zone was to be contemplated. Prior to March\r\n20 the weather had been fine, the ground was good and a thorough\r\nreconnaissance had been made of some 1,500 square miles of country;\r\nsupply dumps had been formed and communication by wireless, cable,\r\ndispatch rider and runner established throughout the units of the Tank\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\nOn March 21 at 5 a.m. the German bombardment opened on a front roughly\r\nrunning from La Fère to the river Scarpe, with a break round the old\r\nCambrai battlefield. The first tanks to be engaged were three forward\r\nsections of the 4th Battalion north-west of St. Emilie, north-west of\r\nPeizière, and at Geninwell copse. These came into action about noon and\r\nfought most gallantly against heavy odds. The first section, supported\r\nby two companies of the 2nd Royal Munster Fusiliers, recaptured a\r\nbattery of guns near Esclairvillers wood; later on in the day this\r\nsection assisted in the counter-attack of the Connaught Rangers on\r\nRonssoy wood; meanwhile the second section cleared the bridge and\r\ncutting north-east of Peizière. Whilst these actions were being fought\r\nin the Fifth Army area, on the Third Army front one company of the\r\n8th Tank Battalion co-operated with the 57th Infantry Brigade in a\r\ncounter-attack on the village of Doignies. Zero hour was fixed at 6.40\r\np.m., but the attack was delayed and it was almost dark before the\r\nobjective was reached. The village was cleared of the enemy, but on\r\naccount of the darkness it was never completely occupied by our own men\r\nand eventually passed back into German hands.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, March 22, an Advanced Tank Corps Headquarters\r\nwas opened at Hamencourt, a mile east of Doullens, in order to\r\nfacilitate the battle liaison duties of the staff. On this day a most\r\nsuccessful and gallant action was fought by the 2nd Tank Battalion in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Vaux Vraucourt and Morchies. At 2.45 p.m. orders\r\nwere issued for the 2nd Tank Battalion to advance and counter-attack\r\nthe enemy, who had broken through the line Vaux Vraucourt-Morchies and\r\nwas pushing forward towards Beugny. Two companies of infantry were\r\ndetailed to support the tanks, but as eventually these could not be\r\nspared the tanks went into action alone. The counter-attack began to\r\ndevelop around Beugny at about 4.30 p.m. Concentrated artillery fire\r\nwas brought to bear on the tanks, but in spite of this they advanced\r\namongst the enemy, put a field battery out of action, and by enfilading\r\nseveral trenches full of Germans inflicted heavy casualties on them.\r\nThe enemy was eventually driven back behind the Vaux Vraucourt-Morchies\r\nposition, which was then reoccupied by our infantry. Thirty tanks took\r\npart in this action; seventeen of these were hit and 70 per cent. of\r\ncasualties suffered by their crews. Heavy though these losses were\r\nthe enemy had suffered severely, and more important still his plan of\r\naction was upset.\r\n\r\nOn the Fifth Army front the penetration effected by the enemy caused\r\na rapid withdrawal of our troops, and to cover this the 4th and 5th\r\nTank Battalions moved eastwards on either side of the Cologne river,\r\nwhich joins the Somme at Peronne; the village of Epehy was cleared of\r\nthe enemy and much valuable time was gained at Roisel and Hervilly by\r\ntank counter-attacks. The German infantry would not face the tanks, and\r\nbroke whenever they saw them advancing.\r\n\r\nOn March 23 no tank action was fought on the Third Army front. On\r\nthe Fifth Army front, the 1st Tank Battalion, which had not yet been\r\nengaged, took up a position on the reverse slope west of Moislains with\r\nmachine-gun posts pushed out on the forward slope. The enemy, however,\r\nwould not attack the line of tanks but worked round their flanks--the\r\n1st Tank Battalion eventually withdrew towards Maricourt. The 4th and\r\n5th Tank Battalions covered the withdrawal of our infantry on either\r\nside of the Cologne river, and by the evening ten tanks of the 4th\r\nBattalion had concentrated at Cléry and those of the 5th Battalion at\r\nBrie bridge, three miles south of Peronne. Shortly after their arrival\r\nhere this bridge was blown up and the whole of the 5th Battalion tanks,\r\nexcept three, had to be destroyed for lack of petrol. Of these three,\r\none succeeded in crossing the bridge after the explosion and the\r\nremaining two effected their escape _via_ Peronne. All three were lost\r\non the next day.\r\n\r\nThe following day, the 8th Tank Battalion was engaged in a most\r\nsuccessful action south-east of Bapaume. Two companies advanced against\r\nBus and Barastre, while a third covered the 6th Infantry Brigade’s\r\nconsolidation of a line of trenches. All tanks came into action and\r\ninflicted heavy casualties at close range, the enemy was checked for a\r\nconsiderable time and the 2nd Division was thus enabled to extricate\r\nitself from a most difficult position with little loss. The enemy was\r\nin force, but as was always the case, he would not face the tanks, and\r\nif he could not work round their flanks his advance halted until his\r\nguns could be brought up to deal with them.\r\n\r\nIt was on March 24 that a considerable number of Lewis-gun sections\r\nwere first formed during this battle out of tank crews who had lost\r\ntheir machines. The 9th Tank Battalion handed its machines over to\r\nthe 3rd Battalion and moved out as a Lewis-gun Battalion from Bray to\r\nassist the 35th Division and the 9th Cavalry Brigade in the defence of\r\nMontauban and Maricourt. The instructional staff of the Tank Driving\r\nSchool which, in February, had moved from Wailly to Aveluy, was rapidly\r\nformed into Lewis-gun sections, and with such tanks as were fit for\r\naction held a defensive line from Fricourt to Bazentin, covering the\r\nAlbert-Bapaume road. The 5th Tank Battalion, south of the Somme, now\r\nwithout machines, was also formed into a Lewis-gun Battalion as crews\r\nwere collected. This battalion in particular carried out most gallant\r\nand useful work, forty-five Lewis-gun groups being kept continuously in\r\naction. Several of these groups lost touch with their headquarters, but\r\ncontinued fighting with any troops in their vicinity until March 31.\r\n\r\nOn March 25 two companies of the 10th Tank Battalion came into action\r\nat Achiet-le-Grand and Achiet-le-Petit. At the first-named village,\r\nwith the 42nd Division, one of these companies attacked the enemy, who,\r\nin large numbers, had broken through near Bapaume, and delayed his\r\nadvance for several hours. By this date no fewer than 113 Lewis-gun\r\ngroups had been posted in the La Maisonette--Chaulnes, Bray and\r\nPozières--Contalmaison--Montauban--Maricourt areas, and during the\r\nnight twenty more were sent out to hold the crossings over the river\r\nAncre between Aveluy and Beaucourt. At this time Grandecourt and\r\nMiraumont were already in the enemy’s hands and the position was most\r\nprecarious. These groups held these crossings for several days and\r\ninflicted heavy casualties on the enemy each time he attempted to force\r\na passage.\r\n\r\nMarch 26 is an interesting date in the history of the Tank Corps, for,\r\non the afternoon of this day, the Whippet Tanks made their debut.\r\nTwelve of these machines, belonging to the 3rd Tank Battalion, moving\r\nnorthwards from Bray were ordered to advance through the village of\r\nColincamps to clear up the situation, which was very obscure. About 300\r\nof the enemy were met with advancing on the village in several groups;\r\nthese were taken completely by surprise, and on seeing the rapidly\r\nmoving tanks fled in disorder, making no attempt at resistance. The\r\nWhippets then patrolled towards Serre and after dispersing several\r\nstrong enemy patrols withdrew, having suffered no losses in tanks or\r\npersonnel. This action was particularly opportune, as it checked an\r\nenveloping movement directed against Hebuterne at a time when there was\r\na gap in our line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nMEDIUM MARK “A” TANK (WHIPPET).]\r\n\r\nSave for a few minor tank engagements on March 27, 28, 29, 30, and\r\n31, so far as the Tank Corps was concerned, the Second Battle of\r\nthe Somme had come to an end, and, before closing this chapter, it is\r\nof interest to deduce the main lessons learnt from these the first\r\ndefensive operations the Tank Corps had ever taken part in.\r\n\r\nOn March 21, tanks were too scattered ever to pull their full weight.\r\nTo hit with them as they then were distributed was like hitting out\r\nwith an open hand in place of a clenched fist, and when the blow fell\r\nthere was no time to hit and simultaneously close the fingers. Out of\r\na total of some 370 tanks only 180 came into action. The continual\r\nwithdrawal of tanks by infantry formations in place of moving them\r\nforwards amongst the enemy resulted in many machines being worn out\r\nbefore they had fired a shot; this was a faulty use of an offensive\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nThe two main lessons learnt were: firstly, that speed and circuit are\r\nthe two essentials for an open-warfare machine; and secondly, one\r\nwhich has already been mentioned but which is so important that it\r\nis worth mentioning again, namely, that no great Army, such as the\r\nGermans massed against us on March 21, can depend on road and rail\r\nsupply only. Consequently unless these means of supply are supplemented\r\nby cross-country mechanical transport, that is, transport which is\r\nindependent of road and rail, the greatest success will always be\r\nlimited by the endurance of the horses’ legs. Men without supplies are\r\nan incumbrance, and guns and machine guns without ammunition are mere\r\nscrap iron. Had the Germans after March 26 been able to supply their\r\ntroops mechanically across country, there can be little doubt that\r\ntheir advance would have been continued, for we could not have stopped\r\nit, and they might well have won the war. Fatigue may stop an advance\r\ngradually, but lack of supplies will stop it absolutely--this is the\r\nsecond and greatest lesson of the Second Battle of the Somme, if not of\r\nthe entire war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTANK SIGNALLING ORGANISATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn battle, co-operation between the commander and his troops, and\r\nbetween the troops themselves, depends very largely on the efficiency\r\nof the signal organisation. In a formation such as the Tank Corps,\r\nthe chief duty of which was close co-operation with the infantry,\r\nthe necessity for a simple though efficient communication was fully\r\nrealised by Colonel Swinton as far back as February 1916, when he wrote\r\nhis tactical instructions for the use of tanks, extracts from which\r\nhave been given in Chapter IV. Though time for instruction was limited,\r\nspecial wireless apparatus was prepared and men trained in its use, but\r\nas orders were received not to equip the tanks with this apparatus they\r\nwere dispatched to France in August 1916 without it.\r\n\r\nOn September 11 the first instructions relative to tank signals were\r\npublished with the Fourth Army operation orders; they read as follows:\r\n\r\n  “From tanks to infantry and aircraft:\r\n\r\n  Flag Signals\r\n\r\n  Red flag           Out of action.\r\n  Green flag         Am on objective.\r\n  Other flags        Are inter-tank signals.\r\n\r\n  Lamp Signals\r\n\r\n  Series of T’s      Out of Action.\r\n  Series of H’s      Am on objective.\r\n\r\n  A proportion of the tanks will carry pigeons.”\r\n\r\nThe use made of these signals is not recorded, and no time was\r\navailable, until after operations were concluded in November, wherein\r\nto organise more efficient methods.\r\n\r\nIn January 1917 steps were taken to introduce into the Heavy Branch\r\nsome system of signalling in spite of the many difficulties, the chief\r\nof which were:\r\n\r\n(i) No personnel other than the tank crews could be obtained.\r\n\r\n(ii) At most only two months were available for training.\r\n\r\n(iii) Neither the Morse nor semaphore codes could be read by infantry.\r\n\r\nThe whole question, after careful consideration, was fully dealt with\r\nin “Training Note No. 16,” already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe entire system of field signalling was divided under three main\r\nheadings:\r\n\r\n(i) _Local._--Between tanks and tanks and tanks and the attacking\r\ninfantry; also between the Section commander and the transmitting\r\nstation, should one be employed.\r\n\r\n(ii) _Distant._--Between tanks and Company Headquarters, selected\r\ninfantry and artillery observation posts, balloons, and possibly\r\naeroplanes.\r\n\r\n(iii) _Telephonic._--Between the various tank headquarters and those of\r\nthe units with which they were co-operating.\r\n\r\nThe means of signalling adopted were as follows:\r\n\r\nFor local signalling coloured discs--red, green, and white. One to\r\nthree of these signals in varying combinations could be hoisted on\r\na steel pole. In all thirty-nine code signals could thus be sent,\r\n_e.g._ white = “Forward”; red and white = “Enemy in small numbers”;\r\nred, white, green = “Enemy is retiring.” These codes were printed on\r\ncards and distributed to tank crews and to the infantry. Besides these\r\n“shutter signals” were also issued, but as they entailed both the\r\nsender and reader understanding the Morse code they were seldom used.\r\nThe chief local system of communication was by runner, and it remained\r\nso until the end of the war.\r\n\r\nDistant signalling was carried out by means of the Aldis daylight lamp,\r\nand as message-sending was too complicated a letter code was used,\r\nthus--a series of D.D.D. ... D’s meant “Broken down,” Q.Q.Q. ... Q’s\r\n“Require supplies.” Generally speaking, until November 1917, distant\r\nsignalling was carried out by pigeons, which, on the whole, proved\r\nmost reliable as long as the birds were released before sunset; at\r\na later hour than this they were apt to break their journey home by\r\nroosting on the way.\r\n\r\nIn February 1917 Captain J. D. N. Molesworth, M.C., was attached to\r\nthe Heavy Branch to supervise the training in signalling. This officer\r\nremained with the Tank Corps until the end of the war, and in 1918 was\r\npromoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and appointed Assistant\r\nDirector of Army Signals in 1918. Under his direction classes in\r\nsignalling were at once started and considerable progress was made in\r\nthe short time available before the battle of Arras was fought.\r\n\r\nIn this battle the various means of communication laid down were put to\r\nthe test of practical experience. The telephone system was described\r\nby the 1st Tank Brigade Commander as “heart-breaking.” “Many times it\r\nwas totally impossible to hear or to be heard when speaking to Corps\r\nHeadquarters at a distance of five to six miles.” Pigeons were most\r\nuseful, the Aldis lamp was found difficult, and many messages were sent\r\nfrom tank to tank, and in some cases to infantry with good results, by\r\nmeans of the coloured discs.\r\n\r\nThe experiences gained pointed to the absolute necessity of allotting\r\nsufficient personnel to battalions for purposes of signalling and\r\ntelephonic communication.\r\n\r\nThe result of these experiences was that in May the first Tank Signal\r\nCompany was formed, the personnel being provided from those already\r\ntrained in the tank battalions, to which a few trained Signal Service\r\nmen were added. The formation of this company was shortly followed by\r\nthat of the 2nd and 3rd Companies, the 2nd Company taking part in the\r\nbattle of Messines.\r\n\r\nIn May the first experiments in using wireless signalling from and\r\nto tanks were carried out at the Central Workshops at Erin, various\r\ntypes of aerials being tested. In July a wireless-signal officer was\r\nappointed to the Tank Corps and he at once set to work to get ready\r\nsix tanks fitted with wireless apparatus for the impending Ypres\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThese signal tanks, when completed, were allotted to the Brigade\r\nSignal Companies, and in isolated cases, during the battle, came into\r\noperation, but in the main they did not prove a great success on\r\naccount of the extreme difficulty of the ground. Eventually these tanks\r\nwere placed at different points along the battle front and were used as\r\nobservation posts by the Royal Flying Corps, wireless being employed to\r\ninform the anti-aircraft batteries in rear whenever enemy’s aeroplanes\r\nwere seen approaching our lines. Many wireless messages were sent and\r\nmuch experience was gained by means of this work.\r\n\r\nBy the end of September, on account of signalling equipment being\r\nobtained, it was possible to carry out training on much better\r\nlines than heretofore. This was fortunate, for it enabled intensive\r\nsignalling training to be carried out prior to the battle of Cambrai.\r\nDuring this battle a much more complete system of signals was\r\nattempted, and wireless signalling proved invaluable in keeping in\r\ntouch with rear headquarters and also in sending orders forward. On the\r\nfirst day of this battle a successful experiment in laying telegraph\r\ncable from a tank was carried out, five tons of cable being towed\r\nforward by means of sledges, the tank carrying 120 poles, exchanges,\r\ntelephones, and sundry apparatus from our front line to the town of\r\nMarcoing.\r\n\r\nThe signalling experiences gained during the battle of Cambrai proved\r\nof great value, the most important being that it became apparent that\r\nit was next to useless to attempt to collect information from the\r\nfront of the battle line. Even if this information could be collected,\r\nand it was most difficult to do so, it was so local and ephemeral in\r\nimportance as to confuse rather than to illuminate those who received\r\nit. Collecting points about 600 yards behind the fighting tanks were\r\nfound to be generally the most suitable places for establishing\r\nwireless and visual signalling stations.\r\n\r\nAt these stations officers were posted to receive messages and to\r\ncompile them into general reports, which from time to time were\r\ntransmitted by wireless to the headquarters concerned.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Cambrai the 4th Brigade Signal Company was formed.\r\nThis Company was the first one to have a complete complement of\r\ntrained Signal Service officers and men allotted to it. It carried out\r\nexceptionally good work during the operations in March 1918.\r\n\r\nAt this time the complete organisation of signals in the Tank Corps may\r\nbe shown graphically as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nA. D. SIGNALS\r\n\r\n(Technical Instructions, Posting of Officers and Men, Control of all\r\nSignal Stores)\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+------+------+------------+--------------+-----\r\n                        |      |      |            |              |\r\n  1st Tank Brigade     2nd    3rd    4th   Wireless Repair  Headquarters\r\n  Signal Company  (Tank Bde.

Battalion      Battalion      Battalion\r\n   Riders.           Headquarters.  Headquarters.  Headquarters.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1918 the type of wireless apparatus as used in the signal\r\ntanks was changed to C.W. (continuous wave) sets, these being more\r\ncompact, and greater range of action being possible with the small\r\naerials the tanks had to use.\r\n\r\nEight of these C.W. sets were issued to each Brigade Signal Company,\r\nand training in their use was carried out up to the commencement of the\r\nAugust operations. On the whole they proved a success and justified\r\ntheir adoption, but as experience was gained it became evident that\r\nsomething better and stronger was wanted.\r\n\r\nIn September a scheme was devised whereby the entire signal\r\norganisation of the Tank Corps was to be recast so as to fit in with\r\nthe new tank group system, which was then being worked out for 1919.\r\nThis organisation included Group Signal Companies and much larger\r\nBrigade Signal Companies than had hitherto been used, and the main type\r\nof apparatus that this organisation was to use was wireless. Only one\r\nset of wireless to each tank company was to be employed actually in\r\ntanks, the other stations being carried forward in box cars so as to\r\nrender them more mobile.\r\n\r\nThe importance of signalling in a formation such as the Tank Corps\r\ncannot be over-estimated, and this importance will increase as more\r\nrapid-moving machines are introduced, for, unless messages can be\r\ntransmitted backwards and forwards without delay, many favourable\r\nopportunities for action, especially the action of reserves, will be\r\nlost. Making the most of time is the basis of all success, and this\r\ncannot be accomplished unless the commander is in the closest touch\r\nwith his fighting and administrative troops and departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH TANK CORPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of the French Tank Corps was due to the untiring energy\r\nof one man--Colonel (now General) Estienne. On December 1, 1915, this\r\nofficer, then commanding the 6th French Divisional Artillery, addressed\r\na letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies in which he\r\nexpressed his firm belief that an engine of war, mechanically propelled\r\nand protected by armour, capable of transporting infantry and guns,\r\nwas the solution to the deadlock on the Western Front. The idea of\r\nthe machine in Colonel Estienne’s mind was the result of his work\r\nthroughout the year 1915, during which period he had seen Holt tractors\r\nin use with British artillery units.\r\n\r\nOn December 12, 1915, Colonel Estienne was given an interview at\r\nG.Q.G., the French General Headquarters, where he set forth his theory\r\nof mechanical warfare. On the 20th of this month he visited Paris to\r\ndiscuss the details of his machine with the engineers of the Schneider\r\nfirm; but it was not until February 25, 1916, that the Department for\r\nArtillery and Munitions decided to place with this firm an order for\r\n400 of these armoured vehicles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Colonel Estienne returned to his command, the 3rd Corps\r\nArtillery, before Verdun, but still kept in unofficial touch with the\r\nmanufacturers. Two months later he learned that a similar number of\r\ncars, but of a different pattern, were to be made by the St. Chamond\r\nworks. These machines were of a heavier type with a petrol-electric\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\nIn June 1916 the French Ministry of Munitions, which had meanwhile\r\nbeen created, decided on an experimental and instructional area\r\nat Marly-le-Roi. Later on, a depot for the reception of stores\r\nwas established at Cercottes. On September 30, Colonel Estienne\r\nwas promoted to the rank of General and gazetted “Commandant\r\nde l’Artillerie d’Assaut aux Armées” and was appointed the\r\nCommander-in-Chief’s delegate to the Ministry of Munitions in matters\r\nconnected with tanks; he thus became the official connecting link\r\nbetween the armies in the field and the constructional organisation of\r\nthe Ministry.\r\n\r\nIn October a training centre was established at Champlieu on the\r\nsouthern edge of the forest of Compiègne, and it was here that the\r\nfirst tank units were assembled on December 1, 1916. During the\r\nsucceeding months, Schneider (see Plate IV) and St. Chamond (see Plate\r\nIV) machines continued to arrive, and training was carried out at this\r\ncamp until the German offensive of 1918.\r\n\r\nOn June 20 a tank establishment was sent to the Ministry of Munitions\r\nand was approved of a month later. This establishment comprised four\r\nSchneider battalions and four St. Chamond battalions, and the creation\r\nof two tank training centres besides Champlieu, namely, Martigny and\r\nMailly Poivres.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Estienne in June visited England, and having seen\r\nthe British Mark I machine was convinced of the necessity of a lighter\r\ntank. This tank was the result of an idea he had in mind, namely, of\r\nproducing on the battlefield waves of skirmishers in open order; each\r\nskirmisher to be clad in armour, and to be armed with a machine gun\r\nwhich could be used with uninterrupted vision in all directions. The\r\nweight of armour necessitated an auxiliary means of motion; this, in\r\nits turn, gave rise to the necessity for another man to drive the\r\nmachine. These views General Estienne laid before the Renault firm\r\nin July 1916, and at the same time he urged the Ministry to accept\r\nhis proposed light tank, but without success. Complete designs were,\r\nhowever, prepared and on November 27 General Estienne was able to\r\npropose to Marshal Joffre the construction of a large number of light\r\ntanks for future operations and to inform him of the existence of the\r\ndesign of such a machine; in fact, 150 had already been ordered as\r\n“Command” tanks for the heavy battalions (see Plate VI). Still the\r\nMinistry was not convinced, and it was not until further trials had\r\ntaken place that, in May 1917, an order for 1,150 was authorised. This\r\nnumber was increased in June to 3,500, when a new sub-department of the\r\nMinistry of Munitions known as “Le Sous-Direction d’Artillerie” was\r\nformed to deal with the production and design of tanks.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all General Estienne’s endeavours, he was still\r\nexperiencing from certain adherents of the old school, the thinkers in\r\n“bayonets and sabres,” that unbending opposition which had proved so\r\nformidable an antagonist to the progress and expansion of the British\r\nTank Corps, and it was not until the battle of Cambrai had been fought,\r\nin November 1917, that the French Ministry of Munitions was finally\r\nconvinced of the value of the tank. Opposition now ceased, and in order\r\nto accelerate the output, the firms of Renault, Schneider, and Berliet\r\nwere all engaged in the manufacture of light _chars d’assauts_.\r\n\r\nIn December 1917 it was decided to form 30 light tank battalions of 72\r\nfighting and 3 wireless signal machines each. Of these 30 battalions\r\n27 were in the field and the remaining 3 undergoing their preliminary\r\ntraining at Cercottes on the date of the signing of the armistice.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the French Tank Corps may be divided into three\r\nwell-defined periods:\r\n\r\n(i) First period, 1917, birth and infancy of the Schneider and St.\r\nChamond types.\r\n\r\n(ii) Second period, first half of 1918, adolescence and maturity of the\r\nSchneider and St. Chamond, and the infancy of the Renault type.\r\n\r\n(iii) Third period, second half of 1918, adolescence and maturity of\r\nthe Renault machine.\r\n\r\nDuring the first period three battles were fought:\r\n\r\nOn April 16, 1917, the French tanks fought their first engagement,\r\ntaking part in the operations of the Fifth French Army in the attempted\r\npenetration on the Chemin des Dames. Eight Schneider companies were\r\nemployed. Three of these were to operate between the Craonne Plateau\r\nand the Miette, and five between the Miette and the Aisne. The former\r\ncompanies failed to get into action and suffered heavy losses from\r\nthe enemy’s artillery, which from the heights of the Craonne plateau\r\ncommanded their advance. The latter companies succeeded in crossing\r\nthe second and third lines of the enemy’s defences, but in spite of\r\ntheir remaining for a considerable time in front of the infantry\r\nthese troops could not follow owing to the enemy’s heavy machine-gun\r\nfire. At nightfall the tank companies were rallied, having sustained\r\nserious losses in personnel and _matériel_. Bodies of infantry had been\r\nspecially detailed to escort the tanks and prepare paths for their\r\nadvance, but their training had been limited and their efforts were\r\nineffectual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV\r\n\r\nFRENCH SCHNEIDER TANK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH ST. CHAMOND TANK.]\r\n\r\nOn May 5 one St. Chamond and two Schneider companies took part in\r\na hurriedly prepared operation with the Sixth Army. The Schneider\r\ncompanies led the infantry in a successful attack on Laffaux hill,\r\nand of the sixteen St. Chamond tanks detailed for the action only one\r\ncrossed the German trenches.\r\n\r\nBetween May and October preparations were made by the Sixth French\r\nArmy for an attack on the west of the Chemin des Dames, and for this\r\nattack infantry were trained with the tanks at Champlieu and special\r\ndetachments, known as _troupes d’accompagnement_, were instructed in\r\nthe ways and means of assisting the tanks over the trenches.\r\n\r\nThe attack, which became known as the battle of Malmaison, was fought\r\non October 23. Five companies of tanks took part in it under the\r\norders of Colonel Wahl, who had recently been appointed to command the\r\nArtillerie d’Assaut with the Sixth Army. This command was the origin\r\nof what later became a Tank Brigade Headquarters, which corresponded\r\nwith a Group Headquarters in the final organisation of the British Tank\r\nCorps.\r\n\r\nIn this battle the Schneider company operated with success, but the St.\r\nChamond machines were a failure, only one or two reaching the plateau.\r\nOn the 25th the St. Chamonds were used again.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it was considered that the French heavy tanks had\r\njustified their construction, nevertheless many still doubted their\r\nutility when the victory of Cambrai, on the British front, dispelled\r\nall doubts in the French mind.\r\n\r\nThe second period now opened and defensive reconnaissances were\r\nundertaken along the French front in view of the expected German\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nIn March 1918 all available tanks were concentrated behind the front of\r\nthe Third French Army as counter-attack troops, and in this capacity\r\ntook part in the following minor operations, which were chiefly\r\nundertaken to recapture features of local tactical importance: on April\r\n5 at Sauvillers; on April 7 at Grivesnes; on April 8 at Sénécat wood,\r\nand on May 28 at Cantigny in co-operation with American troops.\r\n\r\nFollowing the great blow struck at the junction of the British and\r\nFrench Armies in March the German General Staff decided to attack\r\nthe French on May 27. It would appear that this attack was at first\r\nintended only to secure the heights south of the river Vesle, but that\r\nby the 29th, owing to its astonishing initial success, it was decided\r\nto push it forward with the ultimate intention of capturing Paris and\r\nso ending the war before America could develop her full strength. In\r\nsupport of this intention there is evidence that a council of war\r\nwas held in the recaptured area at which the Kaiser, Crown Prince,\r\nHindenburg and Ludendorff were present and at which it was decided to\r\nexploit the success gained to its utmost, not, however, losing sight\r\nof the original plan, which was to include the capture of Reims. This\r\noffensive may be considered to have worn itself out by June 4, on which\r\ndate the Germans had developed a salient forty kilometres deep on a\r\nforty kilometres front. The old capital of France, however, remained in\r\nFrench hands and its occupation denied to the German forces holding the\r\nsalient a most needed line of supply.\r\n\r\nOn June 9 the attack was extended, being directed against the Third\r\nFrench Army between Noyon and Montdidier. Behind this Army four heavy\r\ntank battalions had been assembled. The first and second lines soon\r\nfell into the enemy’s hands, and the French troops, which had been\r\ndetailed for counter-attack, were rapidly absorbed in the defence. On\r\nthe 10th reinforcements were hurried forward, and on the 11th General\r\nMangin launched his tank and infantry counter-attack. This battle\r\ncontinued until the 13th, and in spite of the many difficulties 111 out\r\nof the 144 tanks assembled started at zero hour. Losses in machines\r\nwere heavy and about 50 per cent. of their crews became casualties,\r\nbut in spite of this and the fact that the tanks rapidly outdistanced\r\nthe infantry, a heavy blow was inflicted on the enemy, whose offensive\r\ndefinitely broke down.\r\n\r\nIn the action of June 11 the Schneider and St. Chamond tanks reached\r\nthe zenith of their career. From now onwards, though they continued to\r\nbe fought, they gradually ceased to be used as units, becoming mixed\r\nwith Renault machines until finally, in October 1918, the two remaining\r\nmixed battalions were armed with British Mark V star tanks; these two\r\nbattalions, however, never took the field.\r\n\r\nIn order to stop the enemy’s onrush on May 27, two battalions of\r\nRenault tanks were hurried up by road to the north-eastern fringes of\r\nthe forest of Villers-Cotterets, and on May 31 they made their debut,\r\ntwo companies co-operating with colonial infantry on the plateau east\r\nof Cravançon farm. From this date on to June 15, these two battalions\r\ncontinued to act on the defensive with tired troops; nevertheless they\r\nsucceeded in preventing a further advance of the German Armies. This\r\ncloses the second period.\r\n\r\nDuring the first fortnight of July the 3rd and 5th Renault Battalions\r\nwere moved to the battle area, the former being attached to the Fifth\r\nFrench Army, south of Dormans, and the latter to the Tenth. These\r\nmachines came into action on the 15th, 16th, and 17th of the month.\r\n\r\nOn July 15 the Germans launched their final great attack of the war,\r\nthe blow falling between Château-Thierry and Reims. The French Armies\r\ninvolved in this battle were holding the following sectors:\r\n\r\n(i) The Tenth Army, between the Aisne and the Ourcq.\r\n\r\n(ii) The Sixth Army, between the Ourcq and the Marne.\r\n\r\n(iii) The Fifth Army, between the Marne and Reims.\r\n\r\n(iv) The Fourth Army, east of Reims.\r\n\r\nThe warning order to concentrate his units was received by the G.O.C.,\r\nFrench Tank Corps, on July 14. At that time the G.O.C. Tenth French\r\nArmy had at his disposal five heavy battalions and three light, and the\r\nFifth and Sixth French Army respectively now received one heavy and\r\nthree light battalions. The total number of tank battalions available\r\nwas, therefore, seven heavy battalions and nine light ones.\r\n\r\nThe main attack was to be made by the Tenth French Army, whilst the\r\nSixth and Fifth Armies were to intervene, when the time was ripe, in\r\norder to harry the enemy in a retirement which would be inevitable if\r\nthe attack of the Tenth Army was successful. The entire operation was\r\nto be based on tanks, which were to be engaged to the last machine. As\r\nthis was the greatest French tank battle fought during the war it is\r\ninteresting to enter, in some detail, into the operations of the tanks\r\nallotted to the French Tenth Army.\r\n\r\nOn July 14, when orders were issued for the concentration of tanks on\r\nthe Tenth French Army front, Colonel Chedeville, commanding the 2nd\r\nTank Brigade, was with the Third French Army. He had at his disposal\r\nthree St. Chamond battalions, the 10th, 11th, and 12th, two Schneider\r\nbattalions, the 3rd and 4th, and one complete Light Brigade comprising\r\nthe 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Renault battalions, and the 1st Schneider\r\nbattalion. Of these the first five were in the First and Third French\r\nArmy areas, and had suffered severely in the counter-attack of June 11.\r\nHaving received his orders, Colonel Chedeville at once assembled his\r\nbattalion commanders and explained to them the situation. At 6 p.m. a\r\nfurther conference was held at which the proposed sectors of attack\r\nwere allotted for reconnaissance. These reconnaissances were completed\r\nby 6 p.m. on the following day, and on them was based “Army Operation\r\nOrder No. 243,” in which tank units were allotted as follows:\r\n\r\n  _1st Corps_\r\n\r\n  3rd Heavy Tank Battalion      Allotted to 153rd Division.\r\n    (27 tanks).\r\n\r\n  _XXth Corps_\r\n\r\n  12th Heavy Tank Battalion      Allotted to 2nd American Division,\r\n    (30 tanks)\r\n\r\n  11th Heavy Tank Battalion        „     „   2nd American Division.\r\n    (30 tanks)\r\n\r\n  4th Heavy Tank Battalion         „     „   Moroccan Division.\r\n    (48 tanks)\r\n\r\n  1st Heavy Tank Battalion         „     „   1st American Division.\r\n    (48 tanks)\r\n\r\n  _XXXth Corps_\r\n\r\n  10th Heavy Tank Battalion      Allotted to 38th Division.\r\n    (24 tanks)\r\n\r\n  _In Army Reserve in the region of Villers-Cotterets--Fleury_\r\n\r\n  1st Light Tank Battalion (45 tanks)\r\n\r\n  2nd Light Tank Battalion (40 tanks)\r\n\r\n  3rd Light Tank Battalion (45 tanks)\r\n\r\nThe assembly positions from north to south of the various units were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  3rd Heavy Tank Battalion      Ravine south-west of Montigny-Lengrain.\r\n\r\n  12th Heavy Tank Battalion     Ravine north of Mortefontaine.\r\n\r\n  11th Heavy Tank Battalion     Two Companies Ravine Longavesne and\r\n                                  Lepine farm, 1 Company ravine 1\r\n                                  kilometre north of Soucy.\r\n\r\n  4th Heavy Tank Battalion      Northern fringes of the forest of\r\n                                  Villers-Cotterets south-east of\r\n                                  Vivières.\r\n\r\n  1st Heavy Tank Battalion      Maison Forestière, 200 metres north of\r\n                                  the railway on the road from Villers\r\n                                  to Soissons.\r\n\r\n  10th Heavy Tank Battalion     Cross-roads south-east of the Cordeliers\r\n                                  cross in Villers-Cotterets forest.\r\n\r\n  1st Light Tank Battalion      Northern edge of Villers-Cotterets\r\n                                  south-west of Vivières, ready to\r\n                                  attack in the wake of the Moroccan\r\n                                  Division.\r\n\r\n  2nd Light Tank Battalion      Northern edge of forest south-west of\r\n                                  Vivières ready to follow 2nd American\r\n                                  Division.\r\n\r\n  3rd Light Tank Battalion      St. George’s cross, ready to support\r\n                                  either the 48th Division or the XIth\r\n                                  Corps.\r\n\r\nOwing to the failure of the Military Transportation Authorities great\r\ndelay was occasioned in the arrival of several units, and in some cases\r\ntanks had to be left behind. Generally speaking, detraining stations\r\nwere not far enough forward; this resulted in the 1st and 3rd Light\r\nBattalions arriving late at their destinations.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of July 17-18, the various units proceeded to their\r\nstarting-points in rear of their respective lines of attack.\r\n\r\n  3rd Heavy Tank Battalion }\r\n  153rd Division           }St. Bandry--Saconin et Breuil--Vauxbuin.\r\n\r\n  11th Heavy Tank Battalion}\r\n  12th Heavy Tank Battalion}Cutry--Missy aux Bois Ploisy.\r\n  1st American Division    }\r\n\r\n  4th Heavy Tank Battalion }\r\n  Moroccan Division        }St. Pierre Aigle--Chaudun--Villemontoire.\r\n\r\n  1st Heavy Tank Battalion }\r\n  2nd American Division    }Chavigny--Beaurepaire Forest--Vierzy--Tigny.\r\n\r\n  10th Heavy Tank Battalion}\r\n  38th and 48th Divisions  }Longpont--Villers Helon--Le Plessier Huleu.\r\n\r\nThe attack was launched at 4.35 a.m. in a slight fog which accentuated\r\nits surprise. There was no artillery bombardment. At 7.30 a.m., owing\r\nto the difficulties in communication and the rapidity of the advance,\r\nthe Light Tank Battalions in Army reserve were placed at the disposal\r\nof the XXth and XXXth Corps in order to support the Divisions which had\r\npenetrated the deepest.\r\n\r\nIn this attack the enemy’s resistance was not unusually stubborn\r\nand the tanks and infantry advanced to a considerable depth without\r\ndifficulty. Several tanks of the 12th Heavy Battalion fell out by the\r\nway, but those of the 10th succeeded beyond expectation in negotiating\r\nthe difficult ground in the neighbourhood of Longpont. Of the Renault\r\nbattalions only the first came into action, being launched at 7 p.m. in\r\nan attack on Vauxcastille ravin in which it succeeded in leading the\r\ninfantry forward to a depth of three to four kilometres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF SOISSONS\r\n\r\nJuly 18th 1918.]\r\n\r\nOf the 324 tanks which were concentrated in the Tenth French Army\r\nSector, 225 were engaged on July 18. Of these 102 became casualties,\r\n62 being put out of action by artillery fire. In personnel the losses\r\nwere about 25 per cent. of the effectives engaged.\r\n\r\nOn July 19, composite units were formed and 105 machines took part in\r\nthis day’s fighting, which consisted in divisional attacks on limited\r\nobjectives launched at various hours during the day. By now the enemy’s\r\nresistance had increased so much that several of the tank battalions\r\nsuffered heavily. The 3rd Heavy Battalion had, by the end of the\r\nday, lost all its remaining tanks save two, but in sustaining these\r\ncasualties it had pushed the line forward to the Chaussée Brunehaut. In\r\nthe 12th Heavy Battalion only one machine reached its final objective.\r\nIn spite of this severe resistance the attack was a great success. Of\r\nthe 105 tanks operating fifty were hit by shell fire, and casualties\r\namongst crews totalled up to 22 per cent. of the personnel engaged.\r\n\r\nOn the following day only small local counter-attacks were carried out;\r\nin these thirty-two tanks took part, of which seventeen were hit and no\r\nless than 52 per cent. of their crews became casualties.\r\n\r\nOn July 21 the XXth Corps carried out a prepared attack, the\r\nfirst objective being the line Buzancy--eastern edge of Concrois\r\nwood--Hartennes wood, and the second the line of Chacrise. The attack\r\nwas launched without artillery preparation and the villages of Tigny\r\nand Villemontoire were captured, but later on retaken by the enemy.\r\nDuring this day’s fighting 100 tanks were engaged, of which thirty-six\r\nwere hit; losses in personnel amounted to 27 per cent. of effectives.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 21st it was decided to withdraw all tanks into\r\nArmy reserve so that they might refit for a projected attack on the\r\n23rd. This attack was launched at 5 a.m., the XXth and XXXth Corps\r\ntaking part. The chief characteristic of this day’s fighting was that\r\nthe attack was made against an enemy occupying a defensive position\r\nsupported by a very strong force of artillery. The result of this was\r\nthat no fewer than forty-eight tanks out of eighty-two were hit. It,\r\nhowever, must be remembered that during the six succeeding days of\r\nbattle the tank units, attached to the Tenth French Army, had exhausted\r\nthemselves, having practically fought to the last machine and last man.\r\nOn the evening of the 23rd they were withdrawn in Army reserve, and\r\nthree days later were placed in G.H.Q., reserve.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Sixth French Army had conformed to the requirements of\r\nthe main attack. The tank units of this Army were, on the evening of\r\nJuly 14, placed under the orders of Commandant Michel; they comprised\r\nthe following battalions:\r\n\r\n503rd Renault Regiment: 7th, 8th, and 9th Battalions.\r\n\r\n13th St. Chamond Battalion.\r\n\r\nOn July 15, company commanders reconnoitred the front of attack,\r\nthe tanks meanwhile being got ready for entrainment. On July 18 all\r\nunits were in position with the infantry units to which they had been\r\nallotted, as follows:\r\n\r\n  7th Light Battalion.      2 Companies to the 2nd Division.\r\n  8th   „      „            3      „      „    47th    „\r\n  9th   „      „            1      „      „   164th    „\r\n                            2      „      „    63rd    „\r\n  13th Heavy Battalion      1      „      „    47th    „\r\n                            2 Companies in Army reserve.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd and 47th Divisions were in the IInd Corps, whilst the 63rd and\r\n164th Divisions were in the VIIth Corps.\r\n\r\nAt zero hour plus thirty minutes the tanks left their starting-points.\r\nThe 7th and 8th Light Battalions operated effectively in the capture\r\nof the heights west of Neuilly St. Front and hill 167. The attack of\r\nNo. 325 Company of the 9th Light Battalion, operating with the 47th\r\nDivision, was brilliantly executed north of Courchamps.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the tanks rallied, the attack being continued with all\r\navailable machines on the following morning.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule a section of five tanks was affiliated to each\r\nattacking battalion. This policy continued to the end of the operations\r\non July 26, when the regiment was withdrawn to rest, worn out more\r\nby “trekking” than by fighting. The casualties in this sector were\r\nextremely light.\r\n\r\nWhen the front of the attack, launched by the Germans, on July 15,\r\nbecame known to the French Higher Command, a Light Regiment of tanks,\r\nconsisting of the 4th and 6th Battalions, was hurriedly dispatched from\r\nthe Sixth French Army area to the Fourth Army east of Reims. The 5th\r\nBattalion engaged one company with the 73rd Infantry Division of the\r\nSixth French Army in the recapture of Janvier wood, south of Dormans,\r\non July 15, and two companies on July 16 and 17, in “mopping up” in the\r\ndirection of Bois de Conde, east of Château-Thierry.\r\n\r\nWhen it was realised that the German attack east of Reims had failed,\r\nthe 4th and 6th Battalions were hurriedly transported by road, between\r\nJuly 16 and 19, south of the Marne, south-west of Reims, to take part\r\nin local counter-attacks. These attacks were entrusted to the Ninth\r\nFrench Army, which had taken over command of all French troops south\r\nof the Marne, and had at its disposal the 4th, 5th, and 6th Light Tank\r\nBattalions, and two companies of heavy tanks, which had been rapidly\r\nsent up by train from St. Germaine between Epernay and Reims.\r\n\r\nTwo sections of the 4th Light Battalion were engaged on July 18\r\nwith two battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment; two on July 20,\r\nwith the 97th and 159th Regiments; and one on the 19th, with the\r\n131st Division--all in the neighbourhood of the Bois de Leuvrigny\r\nsouth of the Marne. Later, on July 23, sections of the 4th Battalion\r\nwere employed with British troops--the 186th Infantry Brigade in\r\nthe attack on Marfaux and with the 56th and 60th Battalions of the\r\nchasseurs-à-pied at Connetreuil, whilst, on the same date, two sections\r\nof the 6th Battalion attacked with units of the 15th British Division\r\nbetween Espilly and Marfaux, and two more were employed unsuccessfully\r\nwith the 37th Infantry Regiment against Fauants farm.\r\n\r\nSo ends the account of the tank actions in the battle of Soissons.\r\n\r\nThis great victory, from a tank point of view, had a stupendous\r\ninfluence on succeeding operations, owing to:\r\n\r\n(i) The eagerness with which Infantry Commanders now clamoured for\r\ntanks.\r\n\r\n(ii) The speeding up of the formation and training of new tank\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\nFrom this date on, battalions of Renault tanks became available at the\r\nrate of one a week; this resulted in tired battalions being speedily\r\nreplaced by fresh ones, consequently they were never so completely worn\r\nout as was the case in the British Tank Corps, which only received two\r\nfresh battalions between August and November 1918, one of which arrived\r\ntoo untrained ever to go into action.\r\n\r\nThe operations from now on will be very briefly described, as space\r\ndoes not permit of elaboration. It is, however, of interest that these\r\ntank actions should be enumerated, for they show that, without the\r\nassistance of the tank, a deadlock would have re-occurred.\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 45 French tanks took part in an engagement at Grand\r\nRozoy. Then came the great British tank attack of August 8, in which\r\nthe First and Tenth French Armies co-operated, 110 French tanks taking\r\npart on this day and the following, 80 advancing with the infantry a\r\ndistance of 18 kilometres on the south of the Roye-Amiens road, whilst\r\n30 made a 5-kilometre advance near Montdidier. Between August 16 and\r\n18 the attack developed west of Roye; here 60 Renault and 32 Schneider\r\nmachines were engaged; co-operation with the infantry was, however,\r\ndifficult on account of the broken nature of the old battlefield across\r\nwhich the attack was now being pushed.\r\n\r\nThe next operation was a continuation of the Tenth Army’s offensive; it\r\ntook place between the Oise and the Aisne, beginning on August 20, and\r\nbeing continued intermittently up to and including September 3. On the\r\n20th and 22nd, 12 Schneider, 28 St. Chamond, and 30 Renault tanks were\r\nengaged north of Soissons.\r\n\r\nDuring the week commencing August 28, three Light Battalions advanced\r\nfive kilometres between the Aisne and the Aillette, 305 machines being\r\nemployed at different times during these operations.\r\n\r\nThe next operation in which tanks were engaged was the cutting off of\r\nthe St. Mihiel salient, French tanks being used with the Second French\r\nand American Armies. During the two days’ fighting, September 12 and\r\n13, some 140 tanks took part in the battle.\r\n\r\nOn September 14, the Tenth French Army resumed its offensive east of\r\nSoissons, eighty-five Renault tanks co-operating between the 14th and\r\nthe 16th. Ten days later an extensive joint attack was made by the\r\nFifth and Second French Armies in conjunction with the American Army\r\ncommencing on the 26th; this attack continued until October 9.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Army attacked on a 15-kilometre front in the Champagne, and\r\nin all 630 Renault and 24 Schneider actions were fought. Meanwhile the\r\nSecond French Army and the American Armies attacked on a 12-kilometre\r\nfront between the Argonne and the Meuse, and advanced during the seven\r\nbattle days some 15 kilometres; 350 Renault, 34 Schneider, and 27 St.\r\nChamond actions were fought in connection with this advance.\r\n\r\nAt the urgent request of the Sixth French Army Commander, whose\r\ncommand had joined the “Grand Army of Flanders” after its work in the\r\nSoissons area had been concluded in July, a Renault battalion, less one\r\ncompany, and some heavy tank units were entrained for Dunkerque, the\r\nthird company of this battalion having already been sent on detachment\r\nto Salonika at the urgent request of General Franchet d’Esperey. On\r\nSeptember 30 and October 3 and 4, 55 tanks were employed north-west\r\nof Roulers, and from the 14th to the 19th, 178 tank engagements were\r\nfought, in which the enemy was driven back some 15 kilometres. This\r\nadvance was continued on the 31st of this month in the direction of\r\nThielt, and on this and the two following days 75 tank engagements took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of September onwards, operations generally had consisted\r\nin following up the enemy all along the line and pressing back his\r\nrearguards. On September 30, a minor tank action was fought between\r\nthe Aisne and the Vesle; on October 16 another on the eastern bank of\r\nthe Meuse, and between October 17 and 19 yet another north-east of\r\nSt. Quentin, in co-operation with the British attack further north.\r\nIn this last attack the French Army advanced ten kilometres on a\r\nthree-kilometre front. The last actions fought by French tanks took\r\nplace between October 25 and 31, the first south of the Oise and in the\r\ndirection of Guise, when, on a front of five kilometres, an advance of\r\nno fewer than fifteen was made, the second north-west of Rethel, and\r\nthe third north of Cruyshantem in Flanders.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is interesting to summarise the statistics available\r\nand compare them with those of the British Tank Corps given at the end\r\nof Chapter XXXVII.\r\n\r\nIn August the strength of the French Tank Corps was 14,649 all ranks,\r\napproximately the strength of an infantry division. During 1918,\r\n3,988 individual tank engagements were fought: 3,140 by Renault, 473\r\nby Schneider, and 375 by St. Chamond tanks. Tanks were employed on\r\n45 of the 120 days which elapsed between July 15 and November 11. In\r\npersonnel the casualties between these dates were approximately 300\r\nofficers and 2,300 other ranks.\r\n\r\nFinally it may be stated that as there can be no doubt that July 18\r\nwas the second greatest turning-point in the war on the Western Front,\r\nthe first being the battle of the Marne in 1914, so can there be no\r\ndoubt that the battle of Soissons would never have been won had not the\r\nFrench possessed a powerful force of tanks whereby to initiate success.\r\nThe German General Staff, which should be the best judge of this\r\nquestion, candidly admit that the French victory was due to the use of\r\n“masses of tanks.” Neither was the General Commanding-in-Chief of the\r\nFrench Armies reticent, for on July 30 he issued the following special\r\norder of the day to the French Tank Corps: “Vous avez bien mérité la\r\npatrie,” whilst General Estienne, to whom so much was due, received the\r\nCravat of the Légion d’Honneur and was promoted to the rank of General\r\nof Division for the great services he had rendered to his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE GREAT OFFENSIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the position resulting from the great German attack of\r\nMarch 21 began to stabilise steps were taken by the Headquarters of\r\nthe Tank Corps to reorganise and refit its battalions. This work was\r\nmost difficult on account of the reopening of the German offensive in\r\nthe Lys area, which necessitated converting the 4th Tank Brigade into\r\na Lewis-gun unit and dispatching it north to assist in stemming the\r\nGerman advance. Besides this, towards the middle of April instructions\r\nwere received that on account of the difficulty of finding the required\r\nnumber of infantry reinforcements the number of tank brigades was to\r\nbe reduced from six to four; this meant the disbanding of the 5th\r\nBrigade in France and the breaking up of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th\r\nTank Battalions in England. Yet another difficulty was the question\r\nof re-arming, many machines had been lost during the retirement,\r\nnevertheless, on account of insufficient transport, it was not found\r\npossible to ship out to France the new Mark V tanks, the production of\r\nwhich in England was now in full swing.\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties were eventually overcome, with the result that\r\nduring June and July four brigades of the Tank Corps were re-armed; but\r\nbefore this question is dealt with it will be necessary to hark back\r\nto the various operations which bridge the period between April 4, the\r\ndate upon which the Second Battle of the Somme ended, and August 8,\r\nwhen our own great offensive was begun.\r\n\r\nOn April 9 the Germans launched their second great attack\r\nbetween Festubert and Fleurbaix against the British front. It\r\nsucceeded, so it is thought, even beyond their expectations, and\r\nby the 11th the enemy’s line roughly ran as follows: East of\r\nPloegsteert--Armentières--Steenwerck--Estaires--Lestren--Vieille\r\nCapelle, through Festubert to Givenchy, with the apex of the salient\r\nnear Nieppe. This attack in all probability was meant as a feint\r\ndirected against a weak spot in our line in order to threaten the\r\ncoalfield round Bruay and so cause Marshal Foch to weaken his reserves\r\nin Champagne and on the Somme. Succeeding as it did at first, it\r\nappears that the German command attempted to develop it from a feint to\r\na decisive attack, with the result that their own reserves, of which\r\nthey had none too many, were involved as well as those of the Allies.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the requirements of the new situation on April 11\r\ndetachments of the 7th and 11th Battalions of the 1st Tank Brigade were\r\ndispatched to hold a line west of Merville. Two days later the 4th\r\nTank Brigade, now consisting of the 4th, 5th, and 13th Battalions, was\r\nturned into a Lewis-gun Brigade. On the 13th the 5th Battalion moved to\r\nBerthen, on the 16th the 13th Battalion to Boescheppe, and on the 17th\r\nthe 4th Battalion to the same place.\r\n\r\nBy April 17 the distribution of the Tank Corps was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _1st Tank Brigade_     11th   Battalion   N.E. of Busnes.\r\n   H.Q. Bois D’Ohlain     7th       „       Molinghem.\r\n                         12th       „       Simencourt.\r\n\r\n  _2nd Tank Brigade_      6th   Battalion   Bailleulval.\r\n   H.Q.

This attack\r\nis of special interest as it was the first occasion upon which the\r\nGermans employed tanks of their own manufacture against us.[30] By\r\nmeans of these tanks the enemy penetrated our front, captured most of\r\nthe extensive village of Villers-Bretonneux and advanced as far as the\r\nBois de l’Abbé. Prior to this attack, at 1 a.m., a section of tanks of\r\nthe 1st Battalion, hidden in the Bois de l’Abbé, moved east of the wood\r\nowing to the excessive gas shelling. At 8.30 a.m. this section, under\r\nthe orders of the 23rd Infantry Brigade, moved forward to secure the\r\nCachy switch trench against the enemy’s threatening attack; exactly\r\nan hour later two of our machines, both females, came into view of a\r\nhostile tank and were put out of action by its gun fire--it should be\r\nremembered here that female tanks are armed only with machine guns.\r\nShortly afterwards a British male Mark IV machine hove into sight, and\r\nspeeding into action there then took place the first tank _versus_\r\ntank duel to be recorded in history. This male soon scored a direct\r\nhit on its antagonist, whereupon the enemy evacuated their tank and\r\nfled. By this time three more enemy tanks had appeared; these the Mark\r\nIV machine engaged, and was in the process of driving off the field of\r\nbattle when it received a direct hit from a field-gun shell and was put\r\nout of action.\r\n\r\nSouth-west of Villers-Bretonneux, seven Whippet machines were sent\r\nout at 10.30 a.m. to clear up the situation east of the village of\r\nCachy. Whilst proceeding round the north-east side of this village\r\nthey suddenly came upon two battalions of Germans massing in a hollow\r\npreparatory to making an attack. Without a moment’s hesitation the\r\nseven Whippets formed line and charged down the slope right on to\r\nthe closely formed infantry. Indescribable confusion resulted as the\r\nWhippets tore through the German ranks, the enemy scattered in all\r\ndirections, some threw themselves on their knees before the machines,\r\nshrieking for mercy, but only to be run over and crushed to death.\r\nIn a few minutes no fewer than 400 Germans were killed and wounded.\r\nThe Whippets, having now completed their task, viz. “clearing up the\r\nsituation,” returned, one machine being put out of action by artillery\r\nfire on the journey home; in all only five casualties amongst the crews\r\nwere suffered during this action.\r\n\r\nThe two most remarkable features of this little engagement are:\r\nfirstly, the helplessness of some 1,200 infantry against seven tanks\r\nmanned by seven officers and fourteen other ranks; and, secondly, that\r\nthe tanks left their starting-point, which was 3½ miles from the scene\r\nof action, at 10.30 a.m., covered ten miles of ground, fought a battle,\r\nand were back home again at 2.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nOn April 25 further minor tank operations took place in the\r\nVillers-Bretonneux area, chiefly east of the Bois d’Aquenne and the\r\nMonument, and, on the next day, British tanks for the first time in\r\ntheir history co-operated with the French Army, four tanks of the 1st\r\nBattalion being ordered to assist the Moroccan Division in an attack\r\non the Bois de Hangard. This attack was not a success, due to two\r\nquite exceptional reasons; two trees were cut down during the night,\r\nwhich were to have acted as landmarks for the tanks, and the smoke\r\nbarrage was in error put down to the east instead of the west of the\r\nGerman line; consequently the tanks not only lost their direction but\r\nwere subjected to an intense machine-gun fire when nearing the German\r\nposition; this prevented the French infantry co-operating with them.\r\n\r\nThe month of May was chiefly spent in re-sorting the tank battalions\r\nand resting the men. The embargo on the importation of tanks from\r\nEngland had now been removed, and Mark V tanks were arriving in France\r\nat the rate of sixty a week. This machine, very similar in shape to\r\nthe Mark IV or Mark I, was a great improvement on all former types,\r\nit being a much more mobile and handy weapon. A new system of tactics\r\nwas at once got out to cover its increase in power, and training was\r\nstarted so as to accustom all ranks to its use.\r\n\r\nAt about this time a considerable number of French troops were\r\nbilleted in and around the Tank Corps area and it is a pleasure to\r\nrecord their extreme keenness to learn all they could about tanks\r\nand their tactics. General Maistre, commanding the Tenth French\r\nArmy, with its headquarters then at Beauval, particularly asked that\r\ntank demonstrations should be held for the units of his command.\r\nThis was done, and right through May and June two or three of these\r\ndemonstrations were given weekly. Besides French troops, units from the\r\nIst, XIth, XIIIth, XVIIth, and XVIIIth English Corps and the Canadian\r\nand Australian Corps also attended, the greatest benefit resulting to\r\nall taking part.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of June onwards preparations were set on foot\r\nto have all tank units ready by August 1 for any eventuality. This\r\nnecessitated intensive training, re-arming and re-equipping. Sledges\r\nfor supply haulage were prepared, bridges for the passage of light\r\ntanks over wide trenches were made, cribs were constructed for the\r\nheavy tanks--these were large hexagonal crates which served the same\r\npurpose as the tank fascines did at the battle of Cambrai; wire-pulling\r\napparatus was got ready, smoke apparatus ordered, and portable railway\r\nramps made. It was altogether an excessively busy time on the training\r\nground and in the workshops, and, as matters eventually turned out, it\r\nwas extremely fortunate that this work was taken up at this early date,\r\nfor, as a future chapter will show, when the Tank Corps was next called\r\nupon to make ready for an extensive operation only eight days were\r\nobtainable to prepare in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLES OF HAMEL AND MOREUIL\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring June and July three tank actions were fought: the first was a\r\nnight raid on June 22-23, the second the battle of Hamel, and the third\r\nthe battle of Moreuil or Sauvillers.\r\n\r\nThe night raid is interesting in that it was the first occasion in the\r\nhistory of the Tank Corps in France upon which tanks were definitely\r\nallotted to work at night. The raid was carried out against the\r\nenemy’s defences near Bucquoy by five platoons of infantry and five\r\nfemale tanks. Its object was to capture or kill the garrisons of a\r\nseries of posts. The raid took place at 11.25 p.m. A heavy barrage\r\nof trench-mortar and machine-gun fire was met with at a place called\r\nDolls’ House in “No Man’s Land”: here the infantry were held up, and\r\nthough reinforced were unable to advance further. The tanks, thereupon,\r\npushed on and carried out the attack in accordance with their orders.\r\nIt is worthy of note that not a single tank was damaged by the\r\ntrench-mortar barrage, which was very heavy. The tanks encountered\r\nseveral parties of the enemy and undoubtedly caused a number of\r\ncasualties. One tank was attacked by a party of the enemy who were shot\r\ndown by revolver fire; later on this tank rescued a wounded platoon\r\ncommander who had been captured by the Germans.\r\n\r\nThis raid is interesting in that it showed the possibility of\r\nmanœuvring tanks in the dark through the enemy’s lines, and also the\r\ngreat security afforded to the tank by the darkness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V\r\n\r\nMARK V TANK (MALE).]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Hamel, which was fought on July 4, was the first occasion\r\nupon which the Mark V machine went into action. Much was expected of\r\nit, and it more than justified all expectations. The object of the\r\nattack was a twofold one--firstly, to nip off a salient between the\r\nriver Somme and the Villers-Bretonneux--Warfusée road; secondly, to\r\nrestore the confidence of the Australian Corps in tanks, a confidence\r\nwhich had been badly shaken by the Bullecourt reverse in 1917.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the attack was decided on the training of the Australians\r\nwith the tanks was commenced at Vaux en Amienois, the headquarters of\r\nthe 5th Tank Brigade. Tank units for this purpose were affiliated to\r\nAustralian units and by this means a close comradeship was cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of operations was for the 5th Tank Brigade to support\r\nthe advance of the 4th Australian Division in the attack against the\r\nHamel spur running from the main Villers-Bretonneux plateau to the\r\nriver Somme. The frontage was about 5,500 yards, extending to 7,500\r\nyards on the final objective, the depth of which was 2,500 yards.\r\nThe main tactical features in the area were Vaire wood, Hamel wood,\r\nPear-Shape trench, and Hamel village. There was no defined system of\r\ntrenches to attack except the old British line just east of Hamel,\r\nwhich had been originally sited to obtain observation eastwards. The\r\nremainder of the area was held by means of machine-gun nests.\r\n\r\nFive companies of 60 tanks in all were employed in the attack; these\r\nwere divided into two waves--a first-line wave of 48 and a reserve wave\r\nof 12 machines. Their distribution was as follows:\r\n\r\n  6th A.I. Brigade                           2 Sections (6 tanks).\r\n  4th A.I. Brigade                           1 Company (12 tanks).\r\n  11th A.I. Brigade                          6 Sections (18 tanks).\r\n  Liaison between 4th and 11th Brigades      1 Company (12 tanks).\r\n  Reserves                                   1 Company (12 tanks).\r\n\r\nThe co-operation of the artillery was divided under the headings of\r\na rolling barrage and the production of smoke screens. Behind the\r\nformer the infantry were to advance followed by the tanks, which were\r\nonly to pass ahead of them when resistance was encountered. This\r\narrangement was not a good one and was an inheritance of the Bullecourt\r\ndistrust. The latter were to be formed on the high ground west of\r\nWarfusée-Abancourt and north of the Somme and south of Morlancourt.\r\nOnce the final objective was gained a standing barrage was to be formed\r\nto cover consolidation.\r\n\r\nAs the entire operation was of a very limited character an extensive\r\nsystem of supply dumps was not necessary, so instead each fighting tank\r\ncarried forward ammunition and water for the infantry and four supply\r\ntanks were detailed to carry R.E. material and other stores. Each of\r\nthese eventually delivered a load of about 12,500 lb. within 500 yards\r\nof the final objective, and within half an hour of its capture. The\r\ntotal load delivered on July 4, at 40 lb. per man, represented the\r\nloads of a carrying party 1,250 men strong. The number of men used in\r\nthese supply tanks was twenty-four.\r\n\r\nThe tanks assembled at the villages of Hamelet and Fouilloy on the\r\nnight of July 2-3, without hostile interference. On the following night\r\nthey moved forward to a line approximately 1,000 yards west of the\r\ninfantry starting-line under cover of aeroplanes which, flying over the\r\nenemy, drowned the noise of the tank engines.\r\n\r\nZero hour was fixed for 3.10 a.m. and tanks were timed to leave their\r\nstarting-line at 3.2 a.m. under cover of artillery harassing fire,\r\nwhich had been carried out on previous mornings in order to accustom\r\nthe enemy to it. This fire lasted seven minutes, then a pause of one\r\nminute occurred, to be followed by barrage fire on the enemy’s front\r\nline for four minutes. This allowed twelve minutes for the tanks to\r\nadvance an average distance of 1,200 yards before reaching the infantry\r\nline at zero plus four minutes, when the barrage was to lift. All tanks\r\nwere on the starting-line up to time, which is a compliment to the\r\nincreased reliability of the Mark V machine over all previous types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF HAMEL\r\n\r\n4th July 1918.]\r\n\r\nAs the barrage lifted the infantry and tanks moved forward. The\r\nposition of the tanks in relation to the infantry varied, but,\r\ngenerally speaking, the tanks were in front of the infantry and\r\nimmediately behind the bursting shells. The enemy’s machine-gunners\r\nfought tenaciously, and in several cases either held up the infantry,\r\nor would have inflicted severe casualties on them, if tanks had not\r\nbeen there to destroy them. The manœuvring power of the Mark V tank\r\nwas clearly demonstrated in all cases where the infantry were held\r\nup by machine guns, it enabled the tanks to drive over the gunners\r\nbefore they could get away. There were a great number of cases in which\r\nthe German machine guns were run over and their detachments crushed.\r\nDriving over machine-gun emplacements was the feature of this attack;\r\nit eliminated all chance of the enemy “coming to life” again after the\r\nattack had passed by.\r\n\r\nTanks detailed for the right flank had severe fighting and did great\r\nexecution, their action being of the greatest service. The tanks\r\ndetailed to support the infantry battalions passing round Vaire and\r\nHamel woods and Hamel village guarded their flanks whilst this manœuvre\r\nwas in operation.\r\n\r\nThe tank attack came as a great surprise to the Germans and all\r\nobjectives were taken up to scheduled time. The enemy suffered heavy\r\nloss, and, besides those killed, 1,500 prisoners were captured. The\r\n4th Australian Division had 672 officers and other ranks killed and\r\nwounded, and the 5th Brigade had only 16 men wounded and 5 machines\r\nhit. These tanks were all salved by the night of July 6-7.\r\n\r\nThe co-operation between the infantry and tanks was as near perfect\r\nas it could be; all ranks of the tank crews operating were impressed\r\nby the superb moral of the Australian troops, who never considered\r\nthat the presence of the tanks exonerated them from fighting, and who\r\ntook instant advantage of any opportunity created by the tanks. From\r\nthis day on the fastest comradeship has existed between the Tank and\r\nAustralian Corps. Bullecourt was forgotten, and from the psychological\r\npoint of view this was an important objective to have gained prior to\r\nthe great attack in August.\r\n\r\nThe second battle in which the Tank Corps took part in July was the\r\nbattle of Moreuil or Sauvillers; it is of particular interest, for\r\nit was the only occasion during the war in which our tanks, in any\r\nnumbers, operated with the French Army. Another interesting point\r\nconnected with this attack was the rapidity with which it was mounted.\r\n\r\nAt 2.30 p.m. on July 17 the 5th Tank Brigade Commander was informed\r\nthat he was to prepare forthwith to co-operate in an attack to be made\r\nby the IXth Corps of the First French Army, and, for this purpose,\r\nthe 9th Battalion of the 3rd Tank Brigade was to be placed under his\r\ncommand and that he and this battalion would come under the orders of\r\nthe 3rd French Infantry Division.\r\n\r\nThe object of the operation was a threefold one:\r\n\r\n(i) To seize the St. Ribert wood with the object of outflanking\r\nMailly-Raineval from the south.\r\n\r\n(ii) To capture the German batteries in the neighbourhood of St. Ribert\r\nor to force them to withdraw.\r\n\r\n(iii) To advance the French field batteries eastwards in order to bring\r\nfire to bear on the ridge which dominates the right bank of the river\r\nAvre.\r\n\r\nThe three French Divisions attacking were the 152nd Division on\r\nthe right, the 3rd in the centre, and the 15th on the left. Their\r\nrespective frontages were 950, 2,000, and 800 metres. The greatest\r\ndepth of the attack was 3,000 metres.\r\n\r\nThe operation was to be launched as a surprise, after a short and\r\nintense artillery preparation; the main objectives were to be captured\r\nby encircling them and then “mopping” them up.\r\n\r\nThere were three objectives: The first included Bois des\r\nArrachis, Sauvillers, Mongival village, Adelpare farm and\r\nOuvrage-des-Trois-Bouqueteaux; twelve tanks and four battalions of\r\ninfantry were detailed for this. The second included the clearing of\r\nthe plateau to the north of the Bois-de-Sauvillers and the capture\r\nof the south-west corner of the Bois-de-Harpon; the number of tanks\r\nallotted to this objective was twenty-four, with four fresh infantry\r\nbattalions. The third, known as the Blue Line, an outpost line covering\r\nthe second objective, was to be occupied by eight strong infantry\r\npatrols and all available machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF MOREUIL OR SAUVILLERS\r\n\r\nJuly 23rd 1918.]\r\n\r\nThe attack was to be preceded by one hour’s intensive bombardment,\r\nincluding heavy counter-battery fire. The creeping barrage was to\r\nconsist of H.E. and smoke shells and was to move at the rate of 200\r\nmetres in six minutes up to the first objective, after this at the rate\r\nof 200 metres in eight minutes.\r\n\r\nTanks were to attack in sections of three, two in front and one in\r\nimmediate support, the infantry advancing in small assaulting groups\r\nclose behind the tanks.\r\n\r\nDirectly the orders were issued preparations were set on foot. On July\r\n18, Lieutenant-Colonel H. K. Woods, commanding the 9th Battalion,\r\nand his reconnaissance officers visited General de Bourgon,[31] the\r\nCommander of the 3rd French Division, who explained to them the\r\nscheme; on the next day these officers reconnoitred the ground over\r\nwhich the battalion would have to operate, and tactical training was\r\ncarried out with the French at the 5th Tank Brigade Driving School at\r\nVaux-en-Amienois. On the 20th and 21st training continued, and further\r\nexamination of the ground was made, and on the 22nd details of the\r\nattack were finally settled. In spite of the continuous exertion of\r\nthe last few days all ranks were in the greatest heart to show the 3rd\r\nFrench Division what the British Tank Corps could do.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile headquarters were selected, communications arranged for,\r\nsupplies dumped, and reorganisation and rallying-points worked out and\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nThe move of the 9th Battalion is particularly interesting on account\r\nof its rapidity. On July 17 it was in the Bus-les-Artois area; on the\r\n18th it moved 16,000 yards across country and entrained under sealed\r\norders at Rosel, detraining at Conty. On the night of the 19th-20th it\r\nmoved 4,000 yards from Conty to Bois-de-Quemetot; on 20th-21st, 9,000\r\nyards to Bois-de-Rampont; on 21st-22nd, 7,000 yards to Bois-de-Hure and\r\nBois-du-Fay; and on 22nd-23rd 4,500 yards from these woods into action\r\nwith thirty-five machines out of the original forty-two fit to fight.\r\n\r\nThe country over which the action was to be fought was undulating,\r\nand with the exception of large woods there were few tank obstacles.\r\nPrior to the operations the weather had been fine, but on the day of\r\nthe attack heavy rain fell and visibility was poor, a south wind of\r\nmoderate strength was blowing.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary bombardment began at 4.30 a.m., and, an hour later,\r\nthe tanks having been moved up to their starting-points without\r\nincident, the attack was launched. The tanks advanced ahead of the\r\ninfantry, Arrachis wood was cleared and Sauvillers village attacked,\r\nthe tanks occupying this village some fifteen minutes before the\r\ninfantry arrived. At Adelpare farm and Les-Trois-Bouqueteaux the\r\nenemy’s resistance, as far as the tanks were concerned, was light, and\r\nthe German machine-gun posts were speedily overrun. From Sauvillers\r\nvillage, at zero plus two hours, the tanks advanced on to Sauvillers\r\nwood, which, being too thick to enter, had to be skirted, broadsides\r\nbeing fired into the foliage. Whilst this was proceeding other tanks\r\nmoved forward towards the Bois-de-St.-Ribert, but as the infantry\r\npatrols did not appear they turned back to regain touch with the French\r\ninfantry. About 9.30 a.m., whilst cruising round, six tanks were put\r\nout of action in rapid succession by direct hits fired from a battery\r\nsituated to the south of St. Ribert wood. At 9.15 a.m. an attack on\r\nHarpon wood was hastily improvised between the O.C. B Company, 9th\r\nBattalion, and the commander of one of the battalions of the 51st\r\nRegiment. This attack was eminently successful; the French infantry,\r\nfollowing the tanks with great élan, established posts in Harpon wood.\r\nAfter this action the tanks rallied.\r\n\r\nIn this attack the tank casualties were heavy in personnel: 11 officers\r\nand men were killed and 43 wounded, and 15 tanks were put out of action\r\nby direct hits. The losses in the French Divisions were: 3rd--26\r\nofficers and 680 men; 15th--15 officers and 500 men; 152nd--20 officers\r\nand 650 men. It should be noted that though the 3rd, with which\r\ntanks co-operated, had to attack the largest system of defences, its\r\ncasualties approximately equalled those of each of the other divisions.\r\n\r\nThe number of prisoners captured was 1,858, also 5 guns, 45 trench\r\nmortars, and 275 machine guns.\r\n\r\nAfter the attack, when the tanks had returned to their positions of\r\nassembly, General Debeney, commanding the First French Army, paid the\r\n9th Battalion the great honour of personally inspecting it on July 25,\r\nand of expressing his extreme satisfaction at the way in which the\r\nBattalion had fought. As a token of the fast comradeship which had now\r\nbeen established between the French troops of the 3rd Division and the\r\n9th Tank Battalion, this battalion was presented with the badge of the\r\n3rd French Division and ever since this day the men of this unit have\r\nworn it on their left arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nGERMAN TANK OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that throughout the war the Germans never had at\r\ntheir disposal more than some fifteen tanks of their own manufacture\r\nand some twenty-five captured and repaired British Mark IV machines,\r\ntheir employment of these machines is worth recording.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned the Germans learnt little from the Mark I machine\r\nthey captured and held for several days during the battle of the Somme.\r\nIn fact, they appear to have treated the tanks generally, during\r\nthese operations, with scorn. The machine was indeed mechanically\r\nindifferent, but the German, who is essentially a stupid (_dumm_) man,\r\ncould not apparently differentiate between the defects of mechanical\r\ndetail and the advantages of fundamental principles, such as mobility,\r\nsecurity, and offensive power, which indeed the whole “idea” of the\r\ntank represented.\r\n\r\nThe action at Bullecourt, it is thought, opened the German eyes to the\r\npossibilities of a tank attack, that is an attack in which tanks are\r\nused as the resistance-breakers in advance of the infantry. If two\r\ntanks could accomplish what the two Mark I’s did on April 11, 1917,\r\nthere was no reason why 200 should not win a great victory, and 2,000\r\nend the war. Be this as it may, it was at about this time--the spring\r\nof 1917--that the first German tank construction was begun at the\r\nDaimler works near Berlin, and the result of this was the production of\r\nfifteen machines known as “Type A.7.V.” (see Plate VI), some of which\r\nfirst took the field in March 1918.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics of this tank were: its good speed on smooth\r\nground, on which it could attain some eight miles an hour; its\r\ninability to cross almost any type of trench or shelled ground on\r\naccount of its shape. In weight it was about 40 tons, it carried very\r\nthick armour especially in front, capable of withstanding A.P. bullets\r\nat close range and field-gun shells, not firing A.P. ammunition, at\r\nlong; it was, however, very vulnerable to the splash of ordinary\r\nbullets on account of the crevices and joints in its armour. The most\r\ninteresting feature of this otherwise indifferent machine was that its\r\ntracks were provided with sprung bogies. The use of sprung tracks in so\r\nheavy a tank was the only progressive step shown in the German effort\r\nat tank production.\r\n\r\nThe German tank was 24 ft. long and 10 ft. 6 in. wide; its armament\r\nwas one 1·57 mm. gun and 6 machine guns; its crew, one officer,\r\neleven N.C.O.s, and four private soldiers--exactly twice the strength\r\nof the crew of a British Mark IV tank. This crew comprised three\r\ndistinct classes, drivers (mechanics), gunners (artillerymen), and\r\nmachine-gunners (infantrymen). These three classes remained distinct,\r\nlittle co-operation existing between them.\r\n\r\nBoth the tanks of German manufacture and the captured British tanks\r\nwere divided into sections (Abteilungen) of five machines each, the\r\npersonnel establishment of which was as follows:\r\n\r\n                          _German Tanks._       _Captured Tanks._\r\n  Captain Commanding.          1                    1\r\n  Lieuts. or 2nd Lieuts.       5                    5\r\n  Drivers                     81                   81\r\n  Machine-gunners             48                   20\r\n  Artillerymen                22                   14\r\n  Signallers                  12                   12\r\n  Medical Corps                1                    1\r\n  Orderlies, etc.              6                    6\r\n                            -----                -----\r\n              Total          176 All ranks.       140 All ranks.\r\n                            -----                -----\r\n\r\nThis establishment was a very extravagant one when compared with\r\nthat of a Mark IV section of five tanks, namely, six officers and\r\nthirty-five other ranks.\r\n\r\nBesides the “A.7.V.” machines the Germans employed, during their\r\nvarious offensives of 1918, a number of caterpillar ammunition carriers\r\nknown as “Munitions Schlepper,” or “Tankautos.” These could proceed\r\nacross country as well as by road.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the German Tank Corps was not high, and as regards the\r\npersonnel of the captured Mark IV Tanks it was decidedly low, the\r\nGermans having made considerable efforts to prove to their own troops,\r\nby means of demonstrations, that this type of tank was both vulnerable\r\nand ineffective. The training of this Corps appears to have been\r\nindifferent; a certain number of Assault Divisions were trained with\r\nwagons representing tanks, and in a few cases it is believed that\r\nactual tanks were used with infantry in combined training.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of the German tanks simply consisted in the “mopping up”\r\nof strong points. On several occasions they did get in front of the\r\nattacking infantry, but they do not appear in any sense to have led\r\nthe attack. The following extract from the German G.H.Q. instructions,\r\n“The Co-operation of Infantry with Tanks” (!), indicates that no real\r\nco-operation was ever contemplated. It reads:\r\n\r\n  “The infantry and tanks will advance independently of one another.\r\n  No special instructions regarding the co-operation with tanks will\r\n  be issued. When advancing with tanks the infantry will not come\r\n  within 160 yards of them on account of the shells which will be\r\n  fired at the tanks.”\r\n\r\nIn all, there are nine recorded occasions upon which the Germans made\r\nuse of tanks, the first of which was in their great offensive which\r\nopened on March 21, 1918. In this attack about ten German and ten\r\ncaptured British machines were used, and although they accomplished\r\nvery little they were much written up in the German press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI\r\n\r\nFRENCH RENAULT TANK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERMAN TANK.]\r\n\r\nA little over a month later, on April 24, the only successful German\r\ntank attack during the war was carried out. On this occasion,\r\nwhich has been referred to in Chapter XXVI, fourteen tanks were\r\nbrought forward, and of these twelve came into action and\r\ncaptured Villers-Bretonneux, a point of great tactical importance; a\r\ncounter-attack carried out by the Australian Corps and a few British\r\ntanks, however, restored the situation.\r\n\r\nA month later a few tanks were used by the Germans against the French\r\non the opening day of the great Aisne offensive, namely May 27. None\r\nof these machines, however, succeeded in passing a large trench in the\r\nsecond defensive system known as Dardanelles trench.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, fifteen operated with little success in the Reims sector,\r\neight being left derelict in the French lines. Similar unsuccessful\r\noperations were carried out on June 9 and July 15.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, three German tanks approached our lines east of Bapaume;\r\ntwo were knocked out by our guns and eventually captured.\r\n\r\nOn October 8, some fifteen captured British machines were used against\r\nus in the Cambrai sector. Of this action the German account states that\r\nthese tanks were employed defensively to fill up a gap in their line;\r\nwhether this was so or not, they undoubtedly produced a demoralising\r\neffect amongst our own men, equilibrium only being re-established when\r\ntwo of them were put out of action. Three days later, on the 11th, a\r\nfew tanks were used at St. Aubert; this was the last recorded occasion\r\nupon which the Germans made use of tanks in the Great War.\r\n\r\nIndifferent as were the German tank tactics as compared with our own,\r\none fact was most striking, this being that the British infantry no\r\nmore than the German would or could withstand a tank attack. The reason\r\nfor this is a simple one, namely, inability to do so. So pronounced\r\nwas this feeling of helplessness that when, during our own retirement\r\nin March 1918, rumours were afloat that German tanks were approaching,\r\nour men in several sectors of the line broke and fell back. During\r\nthe German retirement a few months later on we find exactly the same\r\nlowering of moral by self-suggested fear, fear based on the inability\r\nto overcome the danger. This moral effect produced by the tank was\r\nappreciated by the Germans, for in a note issued by the XVIIth German\r\nArmy we find:\r\n\r\n  “Our own tanks strengthen the moral of the infantry to a tremendous\r\n  extent, even if employed only in small numbers, and experience has\r\n  shown that they have a considerable demoralising effect on the\r\n  hostile infantry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF AMIENS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 15 the renewed German offensive on the Château-Thierry--Reims\r\nfront had been launched and failed. Strategically and tactically placed\r\nin as unenviable a position as any army well could be, the Crown\r\nPrince’s forces received a staggering blow on the 18th, when Marshal\r\nFoch launched his great tank counter-attack against the western flank\r\nof the Soissons salient.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this attack the brigades of the Tank Corps were\r\ndistributed defensively along the First, Third, and Fourth Army\r\nfronts, in order to meet by counter-attacks any renewal of the enemy’s\r\noffensive against these Armies.\r\n\r\nEver since the dramatic _coup-de-main_ accomplished on July 4 by the\r\n4th Australian Division and the 5th Tank Brigade in the battle of\r\nHamel, the general interest in tanks had become much more conspicuous.\r\nThe great tank attack at the battle of Cambrai, convincing in worth as\r\nit was to all who had taken part in it, had been somewhat discredited\r\nby the recent German offensive on the Somme front, which was seized\r\nupon by certain soldiers of the old school to reinforce their\r\nassertion--that the day of the tank had come and gone, and that to\r\nfight a second battle of Cambrai was too great a gamble to be worth\r\nrisking. Now a series of projects were asked for which embraced various\r\nareas of operation; in the Fourth Army against the Amiens salient; in\r\nthe Third Army against Bucquoy and Bapaume; in the First Army against\r\nthe Merville salient and in the Second against Kemmel hill. The only\r\none of these projects which offered prospects of a decisive success was\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nOn July 13 the Fourth Army Commander was asked by G.H.Q. to submit a\r\nscheme for an attack on his front. This was done on the 17th, when\r\na limited operation, with the object of capturing the Amiens outer\r\ndefence line, running from Castel through Caix to Mericourt, was\r\noutlined. The force suggested for this attack was three corps and eight\r\nbattalions of tanks. On the 21st a conference was held at the Fourth\r\nArmy headquarters at Flixecourt when, on the suggestion of the Tank\r\nCorps, the number of tank battalions was raised from eight to twelve;\r\nthis comprised the whole Tank Corps less the 1st Tank Brigade, which\r\nwas still armed with Mark IV machines, and which at this time was\r\nengaged in training its personnel on the Mark V tank.\r\n\r\nOn July 27, zero day was fixed for the 10th, but on August 6 this was\r\nchanged to the 8th. All this time, in order to maintain secrecy, no\r\nmention of the impending attack was permitted, and the only preparation\r\nwhich could be undertaken was to send one officer of the Tank Corps\r\nGeneral Staff to the area of operations to study the ground. On July 30\r\na conference was held at the 5th Tank Brigade headquarters at Vaux, at\r\nwhich the Fourth Army Commander explained the plan of operations. From\r\nthis day on preparations were begun, the railway moves being issued the\r\nsame evening.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the original proposal was a limited operation, the\r\ncentre of the attack being carried out by the Canadian and Australian\r\nCorps. The right of the Canadians was to be covered by the French\r\nFirst Army attacking east and south-east of the Luce river. The left\r\nof the Australians was to be protected by two divisions of the IIIrd\r\nCorps operating towards Bray. On July 29 the scope of the operation was\r\nextended as follows:\r\n\r\nTo disengage the Amiens-Paris railway by occupying the line\r\nHangest--Harbonnières--Mericourt.\r\n\r\nTo advance to the line Roye--Chaulnes, driving the enemy towards\r\nHam, and so facilitate the advance of the French on the line\r\nNoyon-Montdidier.\r\n\r\nThe force placed at the disposal of the Fourth Army consisted of the\r\nfollowing Corps:\r\n\r\n  (i) The Canadian Corps--4 divisions.\r\n\r\n  (ii) The Australian Corps--4 divisions.\r\n\r\n  (iii) The IIIrd Corps--2 divisions.\r\n\r\n  (iv) General Reserve--3 divisions, to be supplemented by further\r\n  divisions as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n  (v) The Cavalry Corps--3 cavalry divisions.\r\n\r\nTank battalions were allotted to the 3 infantry corps as follows:\r\n\r\n  (i) Canadian Corps, 4th Tank Brigade--1st, 4th, 5th, and 14th\r\n  Battalions.\r\n\r\n  (ii) Australian Corps--5th Tank Brigade--2nd, 8th, 13th, and 15th\r\n  Battalions.\r\n\r\n  (iii) IIIrd Corps--10th Battalion.\r\n\r\n  (iv) General Reserve--9th Battalion (still refitting at Cavillon).\r\n\r\n  (v) Cavalry Corps. 3rd Tank Brigade--3rd and 6th Battalions.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd and 6th Battalions were equipped with 48 Whippet tanks each;\r\nall the other battalions were heavy units equipped with 42 Mark V\r\nmachines each (36 fighting and 6 training tanks), except the 1st and\r\n15th Battalions, which were each equipped with 36 Mark V One Star\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nAs in the battle of Cambrai the initiation of the attack was to depend\r\non the tanks, no artillery registration or bombardment being permitted\r\nprior to the assault. In all, some 82 brigades of field artillery,\r\n26 brigades of heavy artillery, and 13 batteries of heavy guns and\r\nhowitzers were to be employed. The following is a summary of the\r\nartillery instructions:\r\n\r\n  (i) No artillery bombardment.\r\n\r\n  (ii) The initial attack to be opened by a barrage at zero.\r\n\r\n  (iii) The majority of the heavy guns and howitzers to concentrate\r\n  on counter-battery work.\r\n\r\n  (iv) The field-artillery brigades to be prepared to move forward\r\n  and offer the closest support to the attacking infantry.\r\n\r\n  (v) Special noise barrages to cover the approach of the tanks.\r\n\r\nThe first object of the Cavalry Corps was to secure the old Amiens\r\ndefence line and hold it until relieved by infantry units. The second,\r\nto push forward on the line Roye--Chaulnes. For this purpose the 3rd\r\nCavalry Division with one battalion of Whippets was placed under the\r\ncommand of the Canadian Corps, and one cavalry brigade, supported by\r\none company of Whippets, under that of the Australian Corps.\r\n\r\nOn July 30, the date on which preparations were begun, the Tank Corps\r\nwas distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  _1st Tank Brigade_         7th Battalion      Merlimont.\r\n    H.Q. Estruvalle         11th     „          Merlimont.\r\n                            12th     „          Merlimont.\r\n  _2nd Tank Brigade_        10th     „          Bouvigny.\r\n    H.Q. Bois D’Ohlain      14th     „          Mont St. Eloi.\r\n                            15th     „          Simencourt.\r\n  _3rd Tank Brigade_         3rd     „          Toutencourt.\r\n    H.Q. Wavrans             6th     „          Merlimont.\r\n  _4th Tank Brigade_         1st     „          Coullemont.\r\n    H.Q. Couturelle          4th     „          La Cauchie.\r\n                             5th     „          Bailleulval.\r\n  _5th Tank Brigade_         2nd     „          Querrieu wood.\r\n    H.Q. Vaux                8th     „          Blangy (east of Amiens).\r\n                            13th     „          St. Gratien (near to).\r\n                             9th     „          Cavillon.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate co-operation and staff work it was decided\r\nto break up temporarily the 2nd Tank Brigade and to allot the 10th\r\nBattalion to the IIIrd Corps and the 14th and 15th Battalions to the\r\n4th and 5th Tank Brigades respectively. Besides these units five Supply\r\nand Gun Carrier Companies were allotted for the transport of tank and\r\ninfantry supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII\r\n\r\nGUN-CARRIER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARK V STAR TANK (FEMALE).]\r\n\r\nBriefly the general preparations were carried out as follows: the 1st,\r\n4th, 5th, 10th, 14th, and 15th Battalions were concentrated by rail\r\nin the Fourth Army area, detraining at Poulainville, Saleux, Prouzel,\r\nand Vignacourt between July 31 and August 5. The 3rd and 6th Whippet\r\nBattalions moved to Naours by the night of August 2-3, and thence to\r\nthe Boulevard Pont-Noyelles in Amiens on the night of the 6th-7th,\r\nwhere they lay hid under the trees. Tanks were got ready commencing on\r\nJuly 31, on which date the formation of supply dumps was begun. The 9th\r\nBattalion, which had been withdrawn to Cavillon after the battle of\r\nMoreuil, was allotted to the Canadian Corps for training; the training\r\nof the Australian Corps continuing as heretofore at Vaux. Considering\r\nthe short time available for preparation the speed with which this\r\ngreat battle was mounted redounds to the credit of all ranks taking\r\npart in it. It was a triumph of good staff work.\r\n\r\nThe detailed preparations of the four groups of tanks--3rd, 4th, and\r\n5th Brigades, and the 10th Battalion, are interesting and were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Fourth Tank Brigade._--This brigade established its advanced\r\nheadquarters at Dury. Its battalions were distributed as follows:\r\nthe 1st, 4th, 5th, and 15th Battalions to the 4th, 1st, 3rd, and 2nd\r\nCanadian Divisions respectively.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 Tank Supply Company was split up amongst the divisions of\r\nthe Canadian Corps; three forward wireless stations were arranged\r\nfor as well as one back receiving station; assembly positions and\r\nrallying-points were fixed, and the 2nd Tank Field Company was\r\ndetailed, once the battle began, to clear all obstacles off the\r\nBerteaucourt-Thennes road and to prepare crossings over the Luce river\r\nbetween Hangard and Demuin.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Canadian Corps attack was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions were to make good the Red Line\r\non zero day, except the left of the 2nd Division, which was to push on\r\nand occupy the Blue Line. The advance of the 3rd Canadian Division was\r\ntimed to start at zero plus four hours, the time it was considered the\r\ninitial attack would leave the Green Line. The 4th Canadian Division\r\nwas to follow the 1st and 3rd to the Blue Line and then to the line\r\nMoreuil--Demuin--Marcelcave. The 1st Tank Battalion was allotted to\r\nthis division, and arrangements were made for each of its tanks to\r\ncarry forward two Lewis and two Vickers gun-teams besides the crew,\r\nthese units being intended to assist the cavalry on the Blue Dotted\r\nLine. Besides the above an independent force, consisting chiefly of\r\nCanadian motor machine guns, was to operate down the Roye road.\r\n\r\n_Fifth Tank Brigade._--The 5th Tank Brigade established its advanced\r\nheadquarters at Hospice Fouilloy with a report centre at the north-west\r\ncorner of Kate wood. Its battalions were distributed as follows: the\r\n2nd Battalion and one company of the 13th Battalion to the 2nd and 5th\r\nAustralian Divisions; the 13th Battalion less one company to the 3rd\r\nAustralian Division; the 8th Battalion to the 4th; the 15th Battalion\r\nwas split into halves of eighteen tanks each, one half operating with\r\nthe 4th and the other with the 5th Australian Divisions.\r\n\r\nAs regards supply arrangements, No. 1 Gun Carrier Company was allotted\r\nto the Australian Corps for transport work. Two forward wireless\r\nstations and one back receiving station were fixed, and assembly and\r\nrallying-points settled.\r\n\r\nThe general plan was that the tanks were to advance to the first\r\nobjective under an artillery barrage. On reaching the second objective\r\nall tanks were to rally except those of the 15th Battalion, which were\r\nto push on to the Blue Dotted Line carrying machine-gunners forward.\r\n\r\n_Tenth Battalion._--The whole of the tanks of the 10th Battalion, less\r\none section, were to operate against the first objective and then push\r\non to the second, after which they were to rally west of the first\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n_Third Tank Brigade._--The 3rd Tank Battalion was allotted to the\r\n3rd Cavalry Division and the 6th Tank Battalion to the 1st Cavalry\r\nDivision. The objective of these two battalions was to secure the area\r\nbetween the Red Line and the old Amiens defence line. The advance of\r\nthe 3rd and 1st Cavalry Divisions was to take place at zero plus four\r\nhours. Before the Red Line was reached the cavalry scouts were to\r\nprecede the Whippet tanks and discover crossings over the Luce river at\r\nIgnaucourt and Demuin. If crossings were found the Whippets were to use\r\nthem; otherwise they were to advance eastwards near Caix. The formation\r\nto be adopted by these two battalions was one company to act as a\r\nscreen in front of the cavalry with 200 yards interval between tanks,\r\none company in support, and one company in reserve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF AMIENS August 8th 1918.]\r\n\r\nThe country between our front line and the line Roye--Frise was in\r\nevery respect suitable to tank movement. East of the Roye--Frise line\r\nbegan the French portion of the old Somme battlefield; the ground here\r\nin places had been heavily shelled, but was quite negotiable by heavy\r\ntanks. The flanks of the attack were the two difficult points. Neither\r\npermitted of the use of offensive wings and both offered good defensive\r\npositions for the enemy’s machine-gunners.\r\n\r\nZero was at 4.45 a.m., when 415 fighting tanks out of 420[32] went into\r\naction; this in itself was a notable feat of mechanical efficiency.\r\nThe attack was an overwhelming surprise and, though the enemy was\r\nholding his line in strength, little opposition was met with except\r\nin a few localities. At the battles of Hamel and Moreuil the German\r\nmachine-gunners had learnt to appreciate what the increased mobility of\r\nthe Mark V tank enabled it to accomplish, and not being anxious to be\r\ncrushed under its thirty tons of steel they gave less trouble during\r\nthis battle than on any previous occasion. In spite of this, many\r\nhostile machine-gun posts were hunted out of the standing corn and run\r\nover. Co-operation was throughout good, especially on the Canadian and\r\nAustralian fronts, where the attack swept on irresistibly. On the IIIrd\r\nCorps front the attack started in a state of some confusion, due to the\r\nfog and the uncertain state of the line, the Germans having attacked\r\nthe IIIrd Corps on the 6th, and the IIIrd Corps having retaken most of\r\ntheir lost trenches on the 7th. This undoubtedly complicated the attack\r\non the 8th.\r\n\r\nSouth of the river Somme all objectives were taken up to time; on the\r\nright flank the difficult valley of the Luce was crossed by all except\r\ntwo tanks; this was a high compliment to the crews working on this\r\nflank, for the approach of the tanks was rendered most difficult on\r\naccount of fog.\r\n\r\nBoth battalions of Whippets were engaged with their respective\r\ncavalry divisions and had a considerable amount of fighting to do in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Cayeux wood, Le Quesnel, east of Mezières, at\r\nGuillaucourt and the railway south of Harbonnières, which was held with\r\ngreat determination by the enemy as far as the Rosières-Vauvillers road.\r\n\r\nDuring this day’s fighting a total of 100 machines were temporarily\r\nput out of action chiefly by the enemy’s fire from the Chipilly ridge,\r\nwhich, on account of the partial failure of the IIIrd Corps attack, was\r\nheld by the enemy for several days after August 8. On the evening of\r\nthe 8th the tanks rallied; the crews, however, were so exhausted by the\r\ngreat distance covered, the maximum penetration effected being about\r\n7½ miles, and the heat of the day, that it was necessary to resort to\r\nthe formation of composite companies for the next day’s operation, few\r\nreserves remaining in hand, and the 9th Tank Battalion, which was now\r\nmoving eastwards from Cavillon, was not in a position to take the field\r\nfor at least forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 8-9, the front line of our attack from north\r\nto south ran approximately as follows: along the outer Amiens defence\r\nline to Proyart--west of Rainecourt--east of Vauvillers--east of\r\nRosières--east of Meharicourt--east of Rouvroy--east of Bouchoir. South\r\nof the Amiens-Roye road the line was continued by the French, who had\r\ncaptured Hangest, Arvillers, and Pierrepont.\r\n\r\nUp to 6 o’clock on the morning of August 9, some 16,000 prisoners had\r\npassed through the British and French cages, and over 200 guns had been\r\ncounted. Many prisoners testified to the rapid advance of the tanks\r\nwhich, appearing suddenly out of the mist, rendered all resistance\r\nuseless. It is interesting to record that those prisoners who had seen\r\ntanks before all noticed that they were up against a new type which\r\nmoved faster and manœuvred better than the old ones.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 8th orders were issued that the attack should be\r\nresumed on the following morning with a view to advancing it to the\r\nline Roye--Chaulnes--Bray-sur-Somme--Dernancourt, particular attention\r\nbeing paid to the left flank. A strong position was to be established\r\nnorth of the Somme in order to form a defensive flank to the Fourth\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nOn August 9, north of the Somme, the 10th Battalion put sixteen tanks\r\ninto action with the 12th and 58th Divisions. The attack was, however,\r\nat first held up by machine-gun fire from the woods round Chipilly, and\r\nthe work entailed in engaging these weapons by means of tanks was found\r\nmost difficult on account of the steep valleys in this sector and the\r\nclose nature of the woods. Later on in the day, objectives were gained,\r\nbut only after five tanks had been put out of action.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Somme the 5th and 4th Tank Brigades attacked the front\r\nFramerville-Rosières-Bouchoir with 89 tanks. Near Lihons five machines\r\nreceived direct hits, but in the action round Framerville out of the\r\n13 tanks engaged only 1 was hit. The fewness of tank casualties here\r\nwas undoubtedly due to the excellent infantry co-operation, riflemen\r\nworking hand-in-hand with the tanks and picking off the enemy’s gunners\r\ndirectly the machines came under hostile artillery observation.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd Tank Brigade’s action with the Cavalry Corps was disappointing,\r\nthe tanks being kept too long at their Brigade Headquarters. At\r\nBeaufort and Warvillers the Whippets rendered great assistance to\r\nthe infantry by chasing hostile machine-gunners out of the crops and\r\nshooting them down as they fled.\r\n\r\nOn this day in all 145 tanks went into action, of which 39 were hit by\r\nhostile gun fire.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 9-10, the attack had reached the line\r\nBouchoir--Warvillers--Rosières--Framerville--Mericourt. On the 10th\r\nthe Fourth Army orders were to continue the advance with the object of\r\ngaining the general line Roye--Chaulnes--Bray-sur-Somme--Dernancourt.\r\nNew French forces were also going to attack on the front south of\r\nMontdidier.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 10 the 10th Battalion co-operated in two small\r\nattacks carried out by the 12th Division. Seven tanks took part and\r\nattacked the enemy north of Morlancourt and along the Bray-Corbie road.\r\nThis was the last action fought on this front by this battalion.\r\n\r\nSouth of this, the 5th Tank Brigade carried out a minor night operation\r\nagainst Proyart, and the 4th Tank Brigade with 43 tanks supported the\r\n32nd Division, fresh from the general reserve, and the 4th Canadian\r\nDivision in an attack on the line Roye--Hattencourt--Hallu; owing\r\nto the late issue of orders, the hour of attack was altered, and\r\neventually the advance took place in daylight without smoke. A stubborn\r\nresistance was met with, and out of the 43 tanks operating no fewer\r\nthan 23 received direct hits.\r\n\r\nThe Whippets with the cavalry fared equally badly on this day. They\r\nwere ordered to capture Parvillers, but neither the cavalry nor\r\nWhippets reached this spot owing to the old trench systems and the\r\nbroken nature of the ground. The edge of the old Somme battlefield had\r\nnow been reached, and the time was rapidly approaching when the shelled\r\narea would offer as great an obstacle to the attack as it would an\r\nassistance to the retiring enemy.\r\n\r\nDuring the 10th some 67 tanks in all were engaged, and of these 30\r\nreceived direct hits.\r\n\r\nOn August 11 no appreciable change took place on the British front.\r\nLihons was, however, captured by the 1st Australian Division, assisted\r\nby ten tanks of the 2nd Battalion, otherwise most of the tank\r\noperations consisted in mopping up strong points. On the evening of\r\nthis day the 4th and 5th Tank Brigades were withdrawn from action to\r\nrefit.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days it was decided that, whilst pressure should be\r\nkept up south of the Somme, a new battle should open to the north of\r\nthis river on the Third Army front, and that three Tank Brigades should\r\nco-operate in this attack; this necessitated the transfer of the 4th\r\nTank Brigade to the IIIrd Corps north of the Somme and the withdrawal\r\nof the 10th, 14th, and 15th Battalions from the Fourth Army area; this\r\nleft the 4th Tank Brigade with the 1st, 4th, and 5th Battalions, and\r\nthe 5th Tank Brigade with the 2nd, 8th, and 13th Battalions.\r\n\r\nOn August 17 the general situation was as follows: A total of 688\r\ntanks had been in action on August 8, 9, 10, and 11; 480 machines\r\nhad been handed over to Salvage; very few of the remaining machines\r\nwere actually fit for a lengthy action, and all required a thorough\r\noverhaul; four days, as we shall see, were only possible for this, for\r\nthe next battle was scheduled to open on August 21.\r\n\r\nThe great battle of Amiens was now at an end. A tremendous physical,\r\nand above all, moral blow had been dealt the enemy; not only had he\r\nlost 22,000 prisoners and 400 guns, but also all hope of winning the\r\nwar by force of arms. On August 16 the Fourth Army Commander, General\r\nSir Henry Rawlinson, issued the following Special Order, which sums up\r\nthe reason for this great victory:\r\n\r\n  “The success of the operations of August 8 and succeeding days was\r\n  largely due to the conspicuous part played by the 3rd, 4th, and\r\n  5th Brigades of the Tank Corps, and I desire to place on record my\r\n  sincere appreciation of the invaluable services rendered both by\r\n  the Mark V and the Mark V Star and the Whippets.\r\n\r\n  “The task of secretly assembling so large a number of tanks\r\n  entailed very hard and continuous work by all concerned for four or\r\n  five nights previous to the battle.\r\n\r\n  “The tactical handling of the tanks in action made calls on the\r\n  skill and physical endurance of the detachments which were met with\r\n  by a gallantry and devotion beyond all praise.\r\n\r\n  “I desire to place on record my appreciation of the splendid\r\n  success that they achieved, and heartily to congratulate the Tank\r\n  Corps as a whole on the completeness of their arrangements and the\r\n  admirable prowess exhibited by all ranks actually engaged on this\r\n  occasion.\r\n\r\n  “There are many vitally important lessons to be learned from\r\n  their experiences. These will, I trust, be taken to heart by all\r\n  concerned and made full use of when next the Tank Corps is called\r\n  upon to go into battle.\r\n\r\n  “The part played by the tanks and Whippets in the battle of August\r\n  8 was in all respects a very fine performance.”\r\n\r\nThe success of the operations may be attributed to--surprise, the\r\nmoral effect of the tanks, the high moral of our own infantry, the\r\nrapid advance of our guns, and the good roads for supplies.\r\n\r\nThe main deductions to be drawn from this battle are:\r\n\r\n(i) That once preparations are well in progress it is almost impossible\r\nto modify them to meet any change in objective.\r\n\r\n(ii) That the staying power of an attack lies in the general reserve.\r\nIn this attack the tank general reserve was very weak, consequently\r\nafter August 8 tank attacks began to “peter out.”\r\n\r\n(iii) That the heavy tank is an assault weapon. Its role is in trench\r\nwarfare. Once open warfare is entered on infantry must protect tanks\r\nfrom artillery fire.\r\n\r\n(iv) That the endurance in action of heavy tanks may, at present, be\r\nput down as being three days, after which they require overhaul.\r\n\r\n(v) That the supply tank is too slow and heavy; a light machine such as\r\na cross-country tractor should replace it.\r\n\r\n(vi) That at present wireless and aeroplane communications cannot be\r\nrelied upon; the safest means of communication and the simplest is by\r\ngalloper.\r\n\r\n(vii) That the attachment of tanks to cavalry is not a success; for,\r\nin this battle, each of these arms in many ways impeded rather than\r\nhelped the other. During the approach marches the Whippets frequently\r\nwere reported to have been unable to keep up with the rapid movement of\r\nthe cavalry; during actual fighting the reverse took place. By noon on\r\nAugust 8, great confusion was developing behind the enemy’s lines, by\r\nthis time the Whippets should have been operating five to ten miles in\r\nadvance of the infantry, accentuating this demoralisation. As it was,\r\nbeing tied down to support the cavalry, they were a long way behind\r\nthe infantry advance, the reason being that as cavalry cannot make\r\nthemselves invisible on the battlefield by throwing themselves flat\r\non the ground as infantry can, they had to retire either to a flank\r\nor to the rear to avoid being exterminated by machine-gun fire. Close\r\nco-operation between cavalry and tanks being, therefore, practically\r\nimpossible, both suffered by attempting to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding lesson of the battle of Amiens as far as tanks are\r\nconcerned is that neither the Mark V nor the Whippet machine has\r\nsufficient speed for open warfare. Had we possessed a machine which\r\ncould have moved at an average rate of ten miles an hour, which had\r\na radius of action of 100 or more miles, in this battle we should\r\nhave not only occupied the bridges across the Somme between Peronne\r\nand Ham by noon on August 8, but, by wheeling south-east towards\r\nNoyon, we should have cut off the entire German forces south of\r\nthe Amiens--Roye--Noyon road and inflicted such a blow that in all\r\nprobability the war would have ended before the month was out. Both\r\nfrom the positive and negative standpoint, this battle may be summed up\r\nas “a triumph of machine-power over man-power,” or, if preferred, “of\r\npetrol over muscle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT OF A WHIPPET TANK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this history space has forbidden any extensive reference to\r\nindividual tank actions, though when all is said and done it was on\r\nthese actions that not only was the efficiency of the Tank Corps\r\nfounded but victory itself.\r\n\r\nPrior to the battle of Amiens it will be remembered that the 3rd and\r\n6th Whippet Battalions were allotted to work with the Cavalry Corps,\r\nand that this did not prove a great success owing to the difficulty of\r\ncombining the action of steel mechanically driven with horseflesh. The\r\naccount of the action given below is that of a single machine, working\r\nwell in advance of the attack against the enemy’s communications, as it\r\nis and was considered at the time in the Tank Corps that all the light\r\ntanks should have been. This account is so interesting and instructive\r\nthat it is quoted in full. The pluck shown by the crew of one officer\r\nand two men, though not exceptional in the Tank Corps, is worthy of the\r\nhighest praise. These three men, like the Argonauts of old, launched\r\ntheir landship on an expedition faced by unknown dangers; they fought\r\ntheir way through countless odds and faced single-handed the whole\r\nof the rear of the German Army. But for an unfortunate accident they\r\nmight have returned unscathed to safety. In spite of the misfortune\r\nwhich eventually overtook them, at the lowest computation they must\r\nhave inflicted 200 casualties on the enemy, and at the price of one man\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nIf still there are to be found doubters in the power of the tank, and\r\nin the superiority of mechanical warfare over muscular, surely this\r\nheroic incident will alone suffice to convince them:\r\n\r\n  “On August 8, 1918, I commanded Whippet tank ‘Musical Box,’\r\n  belonging to ‘B’ Company of the 6th Battalion. We left the lying-up\r\n  point at zero (4.20 a.m.) and proceeded across country to the south\r\n  side of the railway at Villers-Bretonneux. We crossed the railway\r\n  in column of sections, by the bridge on the eastern outskirts of\r\n  the town. I reached the British front line and passed through the\r\n  Australian infantry (2nd Australian Division) and some of our heavy\r\n  tanks (Mark V), in company with the remainder of the Whippets of\r\n  ‘B’ Company. Four sections of ‘B’ Company proceeded parallel with\r\n  the railway (Amiens--Ham) across country due east. After proceeding\r\n  about 2,000 yards in this direction, I found myself to be the\r\n  leading machine, owing to the others having become ditched. To\r\n  my immediate front I could see more Mark V tanks being followed\r\n  very closely by Australian infantry. About this time we came under\r\n  direct shell fire from a four-gun field battery, of which I could\r\n  see the flashes, between Abancourt and Bayonvillers. Two Mark V\r\n  tanks, 150 yards on my right front, were knocked out. I saw clouds\r\n  of smoke coming out of these machines, and the crews evacuate them.\r\n  The infantry following the heavy machines were suffering casualties\r\n  from this battery. I turned half left and ran diagonally across\r\n  the front of the battery, at a distance of about 600 yards. Both\r\n  my guns were able to fire on the battery, in spite of which they\r\n  got off about eight rounds at me without damage, but sufficiently\r\n  close to be audible inside the cab, and I could see the flash of\r\n  each gun as it fired. By this time I had passed behind a belt of\r\n  trees running along a roadside. I ran along this belt until level\r\n  with the battery, when I turned full right and engaged the battery\r\n  in rear. On observing our appearance from the belt of trees, the\r\n  gunners, some thirty in number, abandoned their guns and tried to\r\n  get away. Gunner Ribbans and I accounted for the whole lot.[33] I\r\n  cruised forward, making a detour to the left, and shot a number\r\n  of the enemy who appeared to be demoralised, and were moving\r\n  about the country in all directions. This detour brought me back\r\n  to the railway siding N.N.W. of Guillaucourt. I could now see\r\n  other Whippets coming up and a few Mark V.s also. The Australian\r\n  infantry, who followed magnificently, had now passed through the\r\n  battery position which we had accounted for and were lying in a\r\n  sunken road about 400 yards past the battery and slightly to the\r\n  left of it. I got out of my machine and went to an Australian full\r\n  lieutenant and asked if he wanted any help. Whilst talking to\r\n  him, he received a bullet which struck the metal shoulder title,\r\n  a piece of the bullet casing entering his shoulder. While he was\r\n  being dressed, Major Rycroft,[34] on horseback, and Lieutenant\r\n  Waterhouse, in a tank, and Captain Strachan of ‘B’ Company, 6th\r\n  Battalion, arrived and received confirmation from the Australian\r\n  officer of our having knocked out the field battery. I told Major\r\n  Rycroft what we had done, and then moved off again at once, as\r\n  it appeared to be unwise for four machines (Lieutenant Watkins\r\n  had also arrived) to remain stationary at one spot. I proceeded\r\n  parallel with the railway embankment in an easterly direction,\r\n  passing through two cavalry patrols of about twelve men each.\r\n  The first patrol was receiving casualties from a party of enemy\r\n  in a field of corn. I dealt with this, killing three or four,\r\n  the remainder escaping out of sight into the corn. Proceeding\r\n  further east, I saw the second patrol pursuing six enemy. The\r\n  leading horse was so tired that he was not gaining appreciably\r\n  on the rearmost Hun. Some of the leading fugitives turned about\r\n  and fired at the cavalryman, when his sword was stretched out and\r\n  practically touching the back of the last Hun. Horse and rider\r\n  were brought down on the left of the road. The remainder of the\r\n  cavalrymen deployed to the right, coming in close under the railway\r\n  embankment, where they dismounted and came under fire from the\r\n  enemy, who had now taken up a position on the railway bridge, and\r\n  were firing over the parapet, inflicting one or two casualties. I\r\n  ran the machine up until we had a clear view of the bridge, and\r\n  killed four of the enemy with one long burst, the other two running\r\n  across the bridge and so down the opposite slope out of sight. On\r\n  our left I could see, about three-quarters of a mile away, a train\r\n  on fire being towed by an engine. I proceeded further east still\r\n  parallel to the railway, and approached carefully a small valley\r\n  marked on my map as containing Boche hutments. As I entered the\r\n  valley (between Bayonvillers and Harbonnières) at right angles,\r\n  many enemy were visible packing kits and others retiring. On our\r\n  opening fire on the nearest, many others appeared from huts, making\r\n  for the end of the valley, their object being to get over the\r\n  embankment and so out of our sight. We accounted for many of these.\r\n  I cruised round, Ribbans went into one of the huts and returned,\r\n  and we counted about sixty dead and wounded. There were evidences\r\n  of shell fire amongst the huts, but we certainly accounted for most\r\n  of the casualties counted there. I turned left from the railway\r\n  and cruised across country, as lines of enemy infantry could be\r\n  seen retiring. We fired at these many times at ranges of 200 yards\r\n  to 600 yards. These targets were fleeting, owing to the enemy\r\n  getting down into the corn when fired on. In spite of this, many\r\n  casualties must have been inflicted, as we cruised up and down for\r\n  at least an hour. I did not see any more of our troops or machines\r\n  after leaving the cavalry patrols already referred to. During the\r\n  cruising, being the only machine to get through, we invariably\r\n  received intense rifle and machine-gun fire. I would here beg to\r\n  suggest that no petrol be carried on the outside of the machine, as\r\n  under orders we were carrying nine tins of petrol on the roof,[35]\r\n  for refilling purposes when well into the enemy lines (should\r\n  opportunity occur). The perforated tins allowed the petrol to run\r\n  all over the cab. These fumes, combined with the intense bullet\r\n  splash and the great heat after being in action (by this time) nine\r\n  to ten hours, made it necessary at this point to breathe through\r\n  the mouthpiece of the box respirator, without actually wearing the\r\n  mask.\r\n\r\n  “At 14.00 hours, or thereabouts, I again proceeded east, parallel\r\n  to the railway and about 100 yards north of it. I could see a large\r\n  aerodrome and also an observation balloon at a height of about 200\r\n  ft. I could also see great quantities of motor and horse transport\r\n  moving in all directions. Over the top of another bridge on my left\r\n  I could see the cover of a lorry coming in my direction. I moved\r\n  up out of sight and waited until he topped the bridge, when I shot\r\n  the driver. The lorry ran into a right-hand ditch. The railway had\r\n  now come out of the cutting in which it had rested all the while,\r\n  and I could see both sides of it. I could see a long line of men\r\n  retiring on both sides of the railway, and fired at these at ranges\r\n  of 400 yards to 500 yards, inflicting heavy casualties. I passed\r\n  through these and also accounted for one horse and the driver of\r\n  a two-horse canvas-covered wagon on the far side of the railway.\r\n  We now crossed a small road which crossed the main railway, and\r\n  came in view of a large horse and wagon lines, which ran across\r\n  the railway and close to it. Gunner Ribbans (right-hand gun) here\r\n  had a view of the south side of railway, and fired continuously\r\n  into motor and horse transport moving on three roads (one north\r\n  and south, one almost parallel to the railway, and one diagonally\r\n  between these two). I fired many bursts at 600 yards to 800 yards\r\n  at transport blocking roads on my left, causing great confusion.\r\n  Rifle and machine-gun fire was not heavy at this time, owing to\r\n  our sudden appearance, as the roads were all banked up in order to\r\n  cross the railway. There were about twelve men in the middle aisle\r\n  of these lines. I fired a long burst at these. Some went down and\r\n  others got in amongst the wheels and undergrowth. I turned quarter\r\n  left towards a small copse, where there were more horses and men,\r\n  about 200 yards away. On the way across we met the most intense\r\n  rifle and machine-gun fire imaginable, from all sides. When at\r\n  all possible we returned the fire, until the left-hand revolver\r\n  port cover was shot away. I withdrew the forward gun, locked the\r\n  mounting, and held the body of the gun against the hole. Petrol\r\n  was still running down the inside of the back door. Fumes and heat\r\n  combined were very bad. We were still moving forward, and I was\r\n  shouting to Driver Carney to turn about as it was impossible to\r\n  continue the action, when two heavy concussions closely followed\r\n  one another and the cab burst into flames. Carney and Ribbans got\r\n  to the door and collapsed. I was almost overcome, but managed to\r\n  get the door open and fell out on to the ground, and was able to\r\n  drag out the other two men. Burning petrol was running on to the\r\n  ground where we were lying. The fresh air revived us and we all got\r\n  up and made a short rush to get away from the burning petrol. We\r\n  were all on fire. In this rush Carney was shot in the stomach and\r\n  killed. We rolled over and over to try to extinguish the flames.\r\n  I saw numbers of the enemy approaching from all round. The first\r\n  arrival came for me with a rifle and bayonet. I got hold of this\r\n  and the point of the bayonet entered my right forearm. The second\r\n  man struck at my head with the butt end of his rifle, hit my\r\n  shoulder and neck, and knocked me down. When I came to, there were\r\n  dozens all round me, and anyone who could reach me did so, and I\r\n  was well kicked; they were furious. Ribbans and I were taken away\r\n  and stood by ourselves about twenty yards clear of the crowd. An\r\n  argument ensued, and we were eventually marched to a dugout where\r\n  paper bandages were put on our hands. Our faces were left as they\r\n  were. We were then marched down the road to the main railway. There\r\n  we joined a party of about eight enemy, and marched past a field\r\n  kitchen where I sighed for food. We had had nothing since 8.30 p.m.\r\n  on the night previous to the action and it was 3.30 p.m. when we\r\n  were set on fire. We went on to a village where, on my intelligence\r\n  map, a Divisional H.Q. had been marked. An elderly stout officer\r\n  interrogated me, asking if I was an officer. I said ‘Yes.’ He then\r\n  asked various other questions, to which I replied, ‘I do not know.’\r\n  He said, ‘Do you mean you do not know or you will not tell me?’\r\n  I said, ‘You can take it whichever way you wish.’ He then struck\r\n  me in the face and went away. We went on to Chaulnes to a canvas\r\n  hospital, on the right side of the railway, where I was injected\r\n  with anti-tetanus. Later I was again interrogated with the same\r\n  result as above, except that instead of being struck, I received\r\n  five days’ solitary confinement in a room with no window and only a\r\n  small piece of bread and a bowl of soup each day. On the fifth day\r\n  I was again interrogated, and said the same as before. I said that\r\n  he had no right to give me solitary confinement and that unless I\r\n  were released I should, at the first opportunity, report him to\r\n  the highest possible authority. The next day I was sent away and\r\n  eventually reached the camp at Freiburg, where I found my brother,\r\n  Captain A. E. Arnold, M.C., Tank Corps. The conduct of Gunner\r\n  Ribbans and Driver Carney was beyond all praise throughout. Driver\r\n  Carney drove from Villers-Bretonneux onwards.”[36]\r\n\r\n      (Signed) C. B. ARNOLD, _Lieut._,\r\n                _6th Tank Battalion_,\r\n\r\n  _January 1, 1919_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nGERMAN APPRECIATION OF BRITISH TANKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tardy development of both tanks and anti-tank defences has been\r\nreferred to; from this it is evident that the Germans did not take\r\nkindly to the tank idea. In the tank they apparently only saw a\r\ncumbersome machine, a land Merrimac; they were unable to read the\r\nwriting in iron or to understand the message that this machine brought\r\nwith it on to every battlefield, namely, “the doom to all muscular\r\nwarfare.” Why they took so little interest in tanks may have been due\r\nto the feeling that time lacked for their development; it may have been\r\ndue to the extremely low opinion held by the German Higher Command of\r\nour generalship, which prejudiced them against a purely British idea.\r\nThese, however, are trivial reasons, and there must have been a deeper\r\nand broader foundation to their prejudice. The two following extracts\r\nfrom documents issued by the German General Staff appear to supply the\r\nreal reason:\r\n\r\n(i) From an account of the German offensive of 1918:\r\n\r\n  “The use of 300 British tanks at Cambrai (1917) was a battle of\r\n  matériel.... The German Higher Command decided, from the very\r\n  outset, not to fight a battle of matériel.”\r\n\r\n(ii) From an order issued by the German G.H.Q., similar to many others\r\nissued during the war:\r\n\r\n  “The Higher Command is continually hearing that men who are\r\n  classified as ‘fit for garrison duty’ are of the opinion that there\r\n  is no need for them to fight and that officers hesitate to demand\r\n  that they should do so. This totally erroneous assumption must be\r\n  definitely and rigorously stamped out. Men in the field who are\r\n  classified as fit for garrison or labour duties, but who can carry\r\n  a rifle, must fight.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the German tactical policy: masses of men rather than\r\nefficiency of weapons, quantity of flesh rather than quality of steel.\r\n\r\nThe policy of drafting into first-line formations men who could only\r\njust carry a rifle began in 1915. Since this date it was the constant\r\ncomplaint of the German regimental officer that he was obliged “to\r\ncarry” in his unit an ever-increasing number of useless men--men who,\r\nfor physical or moral reasons, were unfit to fight, who never intended\r\nto fight, and who never did fight.\r\n\r\nThe best men went to the machine-gun units and to the assault troops.\r\nIn many cases the remainder of the infantry were of little fighting\r\nvalue, though many of these men might otherwise have been usefully\r\nemployed in a war, which if not one of matériel, was at least one in\r\nwhich economic factors such as man-power played an important part.\r\n\r\nBy abiding by this policy of “cannon-fodder” the German Higher Command\r\nwas able to look at an order of battle totalling some 250 divisions--on\r\npaper a terrific muscular force. Being pledged to a policy of employing\r\nmasses of men for fighting, the Germans were not in a position to find\r\nlabour for the construction of additional weapons such as tanks. It now\r\nseems clear that this policy, at least as far as tanks were concerned,\r\nwas regretted before the end of the war, as the following extracts and\r\nquotations will show:\r\n\r\nIn July 1918 General Ludendorff wrote: “In all the open-warfare\r\nquestions in the course of their great defensive between the Marne and\r\nthe Vesle, the French were only able to obtain one initial tactical\r\nsuccess due to surprise, namely, that of July 18, 1918. It is to the\r\ntanks that the enemy owes his success.” A similar remark was made in\r\nan order of the LIst Corps on July 23, 1918: “As soon as the tanks are\r\ndestroyed the whole attack fails.”\r\n\r\nThe tank victory at the battle of Amiens brought forth a rich crop of\r\nappreciative comments from the Germans. Ludendorff on August 11 wrote:\r\n\r\n  “Staff officers sent from G.H.Q. report that the reasons for the\r\n  defeat of the Second Army are as follows: ‘The fact that the troops\r\n  were surprised by the massed attack of tanks, and lost their\r\n  heads when the tanks suddenly appeared behind them, having broken\r\n  through under cover of natural and artificial fog ... the fact that\r\n  the artillery allotted to reserve infantry units ... was wholly\r\n  insufficient to establish fresh resistance ... against the enemy\r\n  who had broken through and against his tanks.’”\r\n\r\nA 21st Infantry Divisional Order dated August 15 contained the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  “Recent fighting has shown that our infantry is capable of\r\n  repelling an unsupported hostile infantry attack and is not\r\n  dependent on our protective barrage.\r\n\r\n  “On the other hand, a massed tank attack, as put in by the enemy\r\n  during the recent fighting, requires stronger artillery defensive\r\n  measures.\r\n\r\n  “The duty of the infantry is to keep the enemy advancing under\r\n  cover of the tanks (whether infantry, cavalry, or aeroplanes) away\r\n  from our artillery in order to give the latter freedom of action in\r\n  its main rôle, viz.: the engagement of tanks.”\r\n\r\nThis clear statement that the main duty of the artillery has become\r\nthe engagement of tanks is noteworthy, especially when compared with\r\nprevious orders which stated that the allotment of artillery to tank\r\ndefences must not interfere with defensive barrages and counter-battery\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThis document continues:\r\n\r\n  “Counter-attacks against hostile infantry supported by tanks do not\r\n  offer any chances of success and demand unnecessary sacrifices;\r\n  they must, therefore, only be launched if the tanks have been put\r\n  out of action.”\r\n\r\nThus two of the mainstays of the former German defence, _i.e._ “the\r\nprotective barrage” and “the immediate counter-attack,” were abandoned\r\nin the event of tank attacks.\r\n\r\nYet one more order is interesting, that issued on August 12 to the\r\nCrown Prince’s Group of Armies:\r\n\r\n  “G.H.Q. reports that during the recent fighting on the fronts of\r\n  the Second and Eighteenth Armies, large numbers of tanks broke\r\n  through on narrow fronts, and pushing straight forward, rapidly\r\n  attacked battery positions and the Headquarters of Divisions.\r\n\r\n  “In many cases no defence could be made in time against the tanks,\r\n  which attacked them from all sides.\r\n\r\n  “Anti-tank defence must now be developed to deal with such\r\n  situations.”\r\n\r\n“Messages concerning tanks will have priority over all other messages\r\nor calls whatsoever” is the last extract we will here quote, this\r\norder being sent out on September 8, 1918. These few words alone are\r\nsufficient to show that the enemy at last had awakened to the danger of\r\nthe tank and was now making frenzied efforts to organise, at all costs,\r\nan efficient anti-tank defence.\r\n\r\nIt was now no longer the pluck of our Royal Air Force, the courage\r\nof our infantry, or the masses of our shells, it was the tank which\r\nthreatened the German with destruction and against which he now\r\nconcentrated all his energy. These efforts were, however, so belated\r\nthat even the schemes and orders issued were contradictory and lacking\r\nin co-ordination; the actual practice was, needless to say, still more\r\ndiverse.\r\n\r\nFrom August 1918 onwards the success of almost every Allied attack was\r\nattributed to tanks in the German official communiqués. The Allies were\r\nstated to have captured such-and-such a place “by means of masses of\r\ntanks” even on occasions when very few tanks had actually been used.\r\nThis explanation of any German lack of success by reference to tanks\r\nsoon produced very marked results both in the German soldier and the\r\nGerman public.\r\n\r\nSince the German Higher Command could explain away failure in the event\r\nof tank attack the German regimental officer very naturally came to\r\nconsider that the presence of tanks was a sufficient reason for the\r\nloss of any position entrusted to his care. His men came to consider\r\nthat in the presence of tanks they could not be expected to hold\r\nout. Most German officers when captured were anxious to explain that\r\ntheir capture was inevitable and that they had done all that could be\r\nexpected of them. From this time onwards their explanations generally\r\nbecame very simple: “The tanks had arrived, there was nothing to be\r\ndone.” The failure of the Higher Command to produce tanks to combat\r\nthose used by the Allies began to undermine the faith of the troops in\r\ntheir generals.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the “massed tank attacks,” so frequently referred to\r\nin the communiques, the leading German military correspondents dealt\r\nwith the tank question at considerable length. They pointed out the\r\nvital importance of tanks and inquired what the German Higher Command\r\nproposed to do about it, or reassured their readers that the situation\r\nwas well in hand and that a German tank would shortly make its\r\nappearance in adequate numbers. So nervous did the press grow that the\r\nWar Ministry found it necessary to offer an explanation.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Wrisberg, speaking for the Minister of War in the\r\nReichstag, made the following statement:\r\n\r\n  “The attack on August 8 between the Avre and the Ancre was not\r\n  unexpected by our leaders. When, nevertheless, the English\r\n  succeeded in achieving a great success the reasons are to be sought\r\n  in the massed employment of tanks and surprise under the protection\r\n  of fog....\r\n\r\n  “The American Armies also should not terrify us. We shall also\r\n  settle with them. More momentous for us was the question of tanks.\r\n  We are adequately armed against them. Anti-tank defence is nowadays\r\n  more a question of nerve than matériel.”\r\n\r\nOn October 23 the German Wireless published the following statement by\r\nGeneral Scheuch, Minister of War:\r\n\r\n  “Germany will never need to make peace owing to a shortage of war\r\n  matériel. The superiority of the enemy at present is principally\r\n  due to their use of tanks. We have been actively engaged for a long\r\n  period in working at producing this weapon (which is recognised as\r\n  important) in adequate numbers. We shall thus have an additional\r\n  means for the successful continuance of the war, if we are\r\n  compelled to continue it.”\r\n\r\nThis statement was obviously made in reply to public criticism, but the\r\nstatement that efforts were being made to produce a large number of\r\ntanks appears to be true.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, however, if it were true to say that they had been\r\nactively working on tanks for a long time. It is credibly reported\r\nthat when Hindenburg visited the German Tank Centre near Charleroi in\r\nFebruary 1918, he remarked, “I do not think that tanks are any use, but\r\nas these have been made they may as well be tried.” This remark of the\r\nGerman Commander-in-Chief was typical of the general feeling of the\r\nGerman Great General Staff towards tanks up to August 8, 1918. In our\r\nown Army it also expressed precisely the feeling of a section of our\r\nHigher Command. It is hoped that, as this chapter shows the Germans\r\nwere eventually, though too late, cured of their want of foresight, we\r\nhave also been. As to this the future alone will enlighten us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nAEROPLANE CO-OPERATION WITH TANKS\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to July 1, 1918, no definite aeroplane and tank co-operation had\r\nbeen organised, though the want of such co-operation had been long\r\nfelt, and in one of the attacks on Bourlon wood, during the battle of\r\nCambrai, aeroplanes had proved their value in protecting tanks from the\r\nenemy’s field guns.\r\n\r\nThe assistance which aeroplanes can afford tanks falls under the two\r\nmain headings of information and protection; in the future, no doubt,\r\nthose of command and supply will be added.\r\n\r\nPrior to the battle of Arras, in February and March 1917, certain\r\nexperiments were carried out in communication between tanks, aeroplanes\r\nand captive balloons by means of the Aldis daylight signalling lamp,\r\nas already mentioned in Chapter XXIV; these experiments did not prove\r\na success. During the battle of Messines aeroplanes, with considerable\r\naccuracy, reported the whereabouts of tanks on the battlefield. At the\r\nThird Battle of Ypres this useful work was continued, and again at\r\nthe battle of Cambrai, but during these last operations the days were\r\nusually so misty as to forbid much useful work being accomplished.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Cambrai every endeavour was made by the Tank Corps\r\nto get this co-operation regularised and placed on a sound footing,\r\nbut except for some remarkable tests carried out by the 1st Tank\r\nBrigade in the vicinity of Fricourt, in February 1918, in which it was\r\nconclusively demonstrated that low-flying aeroplanes could render the\r\ngreatest protective assistance to tanks, nothing was done to institute\r\na definite system of co-operation. To do so, only one thing was\r\nrequired--namely, the attachment of a flight or squadron of aeroplanes\r\nto the Tank Corps for experimental purposes. At length on July 1, 1918,\r\nsome five weeks before the battle of Amiens began, No. 8 Squadron,\r\nR.A.F., equipped with eighteen Armstrong-Whitworth machines, was\r\nattached to the Tank Corps, for the purpose of co-operating with the\r\ntanks and carrying out experiments with a view to future development.\r\nThis squadron was under the command of Major T. Leigh-Mallory, D.S.O.,\r\nand it was due to the energy of this officer that, in the extremely\r\nshort time available, such extensive progress was made in aeroplane\r\nand tank co-operation, especially in contact work. The benefit which\r\nresulted from this co-operation cannot be over-estimated.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, No. 42 Squadron, R.A.F., had already carried out\r\nexperiments with smoke flares and Very lights which were successful,\r\nwhilst No. 22 Squadron attempted wireless telephony, and No. 15\r\nSquadron visual signalling communication by means of discs swung out\r\nfrom the fuselage. These experiments formed the basis of the work which\r\nNo. 8 Squadron now started on with the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Tank Brigades,\r\ncontinuing it up to the opening of the August offensive.\r\n\r\nThe account of the co-operation of No. 8 Squadron may be conveniently\r\ndivided into three periods:\r\n\r\n(i) The period of preparation, July 1 to August 8.\r\n\r\n(ii) The battle of Amiens.\r\n\r\n(iii) The battle of Bapaume to November 11, 1918.\r\n\r\nDuring the last-mentioned period No. 8 Squadron was reinforced by No.\r\n73 Squadron, which, being equipped with Sopwith-Camel machines, was\r\nable to deal effectively with the enemy’s anti-tank guns.\r\n\r\nThe first essential of successful co-operation being comradeship, a\r\nfirm alliance was at once established between the flights of No. 8\r\nSquadron and the tank units with which this squadron was working.\r\nThis was carried out by attaching tank officers to the flights, these\r\nofficers frequently flying, whilst pilots and observers were given\r\nrides in the tanks.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Hamel, on July 4, was the first occasion upon which\r\naeroplanes were definitely detailed to work with tanks, C Flight of No.\r\n8 Squadron being attached to the 5th Tank Brigade for this operation.\r\nThe morning was a peculiarly dark one, with clouds at 1,000 ft.;\r\nnevertheless one aeroplane managed to get off at 2.50 a.m. and a second\r\nat 3 a.m. These two machines flew low over the enemy’s lines with\r\nthe object of drowning the noise of the approaching tanks. Later on\r\nanother machine, flying down into the smoke of the artillery barrage,\r\nsilenced some guns which were giving considerable trouble. Altogether\r\nthe assistance that No. 8 Squadron rendered the Tank Corps, on this the\r\nfirst occasion upon which these two mechanical arms co-operated, boded\r\nwell of the future.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Hamel, tests and training were continued, “B”\r\nFlight concentrating on wireless telegraphy and telephony with the 1st\r\nTank Brigade, and “A” Flight on visual signalling with the 3rd Tank\r\nBrigade.\r\n\r\nThe wireless telephony tests, though of exceptional interest, did not\r\nprove very successful. Under very favourable conditions speech could\r\nbe heard in a moving tank from an aeroplane flying at an altitude of\r\n500 ft. and not more than a quarter of a mile away. It was consequently\r\ndecided that, for immediate use, wireless telephony was not a practical\r\nmeans of communication.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July a series of most successful tests were carried\r\nout in wireless telegraphy, tanks clearly receiving messages from\r\naeroplanes at 2,500 ft. altitude and 9,000 yards away. Successful as\r\nthese experiments proved, they were destined to be still-born, for\r\ntime was insufficient to develop them or to apply them during active\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe disc signalling carried out by “A” Flight was instituted as a\r\nmeans of directing Whippet tanks on to their objectives. By degrees a\r\ncomplete code of signals was evolved so that the aeroplane was able to\r\ncommunicate both the nature and direction of the target. In conjunction\r\nwith disc signalling, various kinds of smoke bombs and Very lights\r\nwere experimented with, and by means of these several very successful\r\nmanœuvres were carried out at the Tank Gunnery School at Merlimont.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that the period of preparation was too short\r\nto enable the results of tests to be applied in battle, pilots and\r\nobservers had got to know a great many of the tank officers with\r\nwhom they were going to co-operate, and in addition had learnt much\r\nconcerning the limitations of tanks, and the kind of information\r\nrequired by their staffs and crews during action.\r\n\r\nThe programme of work for No. 8 Squadron on the opening day of the\r\nbattle of Amiens was as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) Machines to fly over the line for the last hour of the tank\r\napproach march in order to drown the noise of the tank engines.\r\n\r\n(ii) Contact and counter-attack patrols to keep tank units constantly\r\ninformed, by dropping messages at fixed stations, as to the progress of\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\n(iii) All machines were instructed to help the tanks whenever an\r\nopportunity arose.\r\n\r\nOn August 5 the Squadron concentrated at Vignacourt, “C” Flight being\r\ndetailed to work with the 5th Tank Brigade and “B” and “A” Flights with\r\nthe 4th and 3rd Brigades.\r\n\r\nAt 2.50 a.m. on August 8 three machines “took off” to cover the tanks\r\nduring the last hour of the approach march. The morning was dark and\r\nthe clouds appeared high. Each of these machines dropped six 25 lb.\r\nbombs, at intervals, over the enemy’s lines. Between 4.50 a.m. and\r\n5 a.m. the first four tank-contact patrol machines “took off.” The\r\nvalleys were already coated with thick mist and within an hour the\r\nwhole country for miles was obscured. By flying very low and making\r\nuse of gaps in the mist, one of these machines was able to report that\r\ntanks had passed through Demuin, and consequently it was known that the\r\nbridge there must be intact. The first message to be dropped at the\r\nAdvanced Headquarters of the Tank Corps read as follows:\r\n\r\n  “To Advanced H.Q. Tank Corps\r\n        “(per aeroplane).\r\n  “W.4. 8th.\r\n\r\n  “Machine landed 8.30 a.m. reports AAA 6.15 a.m. 4 tanks seen in\r\n  action on a line 500 yards west of road through C.17.b, C.11.d,\r\n  C.12.a AAA 7.15 a.m. 4 tanks seen together heading E on road\r\n  beyond Hourges at C.11 central AAA 3 tanks seen together in C.6.d\r\n  uncertain AAA 7.20 a.m. Green Line taken, tanks rallying to move\r\n  off again AAA Foregoing report applies to 5th Tank Battalion\r\n  Sector AAA 7.45 a.m. 4 tanks on road leading north out of Demuin\r\n  V.25.C.4.8 AAA 1 tank at D.1.c central AAA 4 tanks at C.11.d.3.8\r\n  heading east AAA 7.45 a.m. French infantry seen in large numbers\r\n  on western outskirts of Moreuil wood and French barrage on a\r\n  line C.17.c C.23.a, & C.29.a & 28.D AAA Motor transport probably\r\n  armoured cars seen on road in U.26 near Domart AAA German balloon\r\n  observed up just east of Caix about 8 a.m. at 1,200 ft.

On August 9 and 10 good targets\r\nwere observed from the air in the form of large parties of infantry\r\nand transport. On the 10th, Captain West and Lieutenant Haslam were\r\nco-operating with tanks near Rosières when movement along the roads was\r\nnoticed in the neighbourhood of Roye. Although some 8,000 yards from\r\nour lines Captain West immediately flew his machines in that direction\r\nand with great effect bombed and fired on the enemy’s transport\r\nmoving eastwards. Just as he turned to fly back he was attacked by\r\nseven Fokker biplanes. With almost the first burst one of the hostile\r\nmachines, which had got above Captain West’s right-hand wing, shot his\r\nleft leg off between the knee and the thigh, three explosive bullets\r\nhitting it. In spite of the fact that West’s leg fell amongst the\r\ncontrols and that he was wounded in the right foot he managed to fly\r\nhis machine back and land it in our lines. For this act of gallantry he\r\nwas awarded the Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle of Amiens aeroplane co-operation had been chiefly\r\nconfined to contact and counter-attack patrols. The tanks had, however,\r\nduring this battle, suffered heavily from the German field guns, so, in\r\nthe next great battle, the battle of Bapaume, it was decided to make\r\ncounter-gun work a feature of aeroplane co-operation.\r\n\r\nInstead of sending all machines up on contact and counter-attack\r\npatrol, as many machines as possible were reserved for counter-gun\r\nwork. From this time onwards the tendency was to concentrate more and\r\nmore on this important duty, and as fresh experiences were gained this\r\nwork grew more and more successful. Fortunately, just before the Third\r\nArmy attack began, on August 21, No. 73 Squadron (Sopwith-Camels) was\r\nattached to the Tank Corps for this form of co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe tactics adopted in this counter-gun work are interesting. To send\r\ndown zone calls was useless, as the German gunners opened fire, as a\r\nrule, when the tanks were but 1,000 yards away. Immediate action was,\r\ntherefore, necessary, and this was taken by bombing and machine-gunning\r\nhostile artillery until the tanks had run over the emplacements. The\r\nmethod of locating the hostile gun positions consisted in carefully\r\nstudying the ground prior to the attack by consulting maps and air\r\nphotographs, and from this study to make out a chart of all likely gun\r\npositions. On September 2 a most valuable document was captured which\r\nset forth the complete scheme the Germans had adopted in connection\r\nwith the distribution of their guns for anti-tank work; further, in\r\nthis document were described the various types of positions anti-tank\r\ngunners should take up. By the aid of this document and a large-scale\r\nmap it was possible to plot out beforehand the majority of possible\r\ngun positions. As each of our aeroplanes had only about 2,000 yards of\r\nfront to watch, the result was that all likely places were periodically\r\nbombed. In this way, by selecting the likely places beforehand, a great\r\nnumber of anti-tank guns were spotted as soon as they opened fire, and\r\nthus immense service was rendered to the tanks.\r\n\r\nAugust 21 was the most disappointing day No. 8 Squadron experienced\r\nwhilst attached to the Tank Corps. The morning was very foggy and it\r\nwas quite impossible for the machines to leave the ground until 11\r\na.m., a little over six hours after zero, which was at 4.55 a.m. In\r\nspite of this the counter-gun machines were not too late to carry out\r\nuseful work against several batteries; this work was chiefly carried\r\nout by No. 73 Squadron, which was quite new to the work. The value\r\nof the experience gained on this day was amply demonstrated by the\r\neffective work carried out by this Squadron on the 23rd, when many\r\nhostile guns were attacked and their crews scattered. A good example of\r\nthe valuable work carried out by No. 73 Squadron occurred on September\r\n2.\r\n\r\nA gun was observed being man-handled towards Chaufours wood; 800 rounds\r\nwere fired at it, the gun crew leaving the gun and seeking security\r\nin the wood. A little later on this crew, emerging from the wood,\r\nattempted to haul the gun into it; fire was once again opened by the\r\naeroplane, but in spite of it the crew succeeded in their object. Bombs\r\nwere then dropped on the wood, and no further movement was observed.\r\n\r\nOn September 29 a wireless-signal tank was used as a dropping station.\r\nThis proved a most useful innovation, for one aeroplane dropping its\r\nmessage at this station found, on its return home, that this message\r\nhad been received by the headquarters to which it was directed within\r\na few minutes of it having been dropped, in fact, far quicker than it\r\nwould have been had the aeroplane dropped it at the headquarters itself.\r\n\r\nThe dropping of messages to tanks in action was also successfully\r\naccomplished during the 29th. One of these messages sent down the\r\ninformation that the Germans were still holding the village of Bony;\r\na group of tanks, receiving this, at once wheeled towards Bony and\r\nattacked it.\r\n\r\nOn October 8 aeroplanes once again carried out useful co-operation\r\nwith the tanks. The following account is taken from the report of an\r\naeroplane the pilot of which observed the tanks attacking Serain:\r\n\r\n  “As the tanks were approaching we dropped bombs on various\r\n  parties of Germans who were in the village. The tanks were then\r\n  surrounding the village, one going right into the centre of it; a\r\n  second attacked the orchard to the south, mopping up parties of\r\n  Germans; whilst a third came round the north of the village and was\r\n  approaching a small valley in which were 200 to 300 Germans covered\r\n  by a stretch of dead ground. On seeing the tank approaching the\r\n  Germans fled eastwards, whereupon we flew towards them firing our\r\n  machine guns, doing great execution.”\r\n\r\nSuch actions as these were of daily occurrence and they only went to\r\nprove what the headquarters of the Tank Corps had long held--namely,\r\nthat the co-operation of aeroplanes with tanks is of incalculable\r\nimportance, the aeroplanes protecting the tanks and the tanks\r\nprotecting the infantry. In the future, no doubt, not only will\r\nmessages be dropped and hostile guns silenced, but the commanders\r\nof tank battalions will be carried in the air, these officers\r\ncommunicating with their machines by means of wireless telephony, and\r\nsupplies of petrol will be transported by means of aeroplane for the\r\nreplenishment of the tanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF BAPAUME AND THE SECOND BATTLE OF ARRAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operations which took place between the conclusion of the great\r\nbattle of Amiens and the signing of the armistice may conveniently be\r\ndivided into three periods:\r\n\r\n(i) The battle of Bapaume and the Second Battle of Arras--August 21 to\r\nSeptember 3.\r\n\r\n(ii) The battles of Epehy and Cambrai St. Quentin--September 18 to\r\nOctober 10.\r\n\r\n(iii) The battles of the Selle and Maubeuge--October 17 to November 11.\r\n\r\nThe first comprises the fighting in the devastated area, the second\r\nthe breaking through of the Hindenburg system of trenches, and the\r\nthird open warfare east of this system. Each of these periods will be\r\ndealt with in a separate chapter, in which most of the detail of battle\r\npreparation will be omitted so as to avoid a repetition of descriptions\r\nof work which had by now been reduced to a routine in the Tank Corps.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the battle of Amiens it became apparent that the\r\nenemy was commencing to withdraw his troops in the Pusieux-Serre area\r\nopposite the Third Army front, and that, in all probability, this\r\nretirement was only part of a general withdrawal on the entire front\r\nsouth of the Scarpe. It was, therefore, decided on August 13 that the\r\nThird Army should prepare an attack on the German front north of the\r\nSomme, whilst the Fourth Army continued to press the enemy south of\r\nthis river. Consequent on this decision the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 10th, 14th,\r\nand 15th Tank Battalions were withdrawn from the Fourth Army area, and\r\nconcentrated in that of the Third. On August 15 to these battalions\r\nwere added the 7th, 11th, and 12th of the 1st Tank Brigade. These\r\nmoves necessitated a complete reshuffling of Tank Brigades, which on\r\nAugust 19 were constituted as follows:\r\n\r\n    (i) _In the Third Army Area:_\r\n\r\n  1st Tank Brigade            3rd Battalion   Medium A.\r\n                              7th    „        Mark IV.\r\n                             10th    „        Mark V.\r\n                             17th    „        Armoured cars.\r\n\r\n  2nd Tank Brigade            6th    „        Medium A.\r\n                             12th    „        Mark IV.\r\n                             15th    „        Mark V Star.\r\n\r\n  3rd Tank Brigade            9th    „        Mark V.\r\n                             11th    „        Mark V Star.\r\n                             14th    „        Mark V.\r\n\r\n    _(ii) In the Fourth Army Area:_\r\n\r\n  4th Tank Brigade            1st Battalion   Mark V Star.\r\n                              4th    „        Mark V.\r\n                              5th    „        Mark V.\r\n\r\n  5th Tank Brigade            2nd    „        Mark V.\r\n                              8th    „        Mark V.\r\n                             13th    „        Mark V.\r\n\r\nOn the Third Army front the attack was to be launched on August 21\r\nand, if successful, this attack was to be pushed forward and the front\r\nextended by an attack delivered by the Fourth Army south of the Somme.\r\nThe general plan was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe VIth, IVth, and Vth Corps of the Third Army were to attack on the\r\nline Beaucourt-sur-Ancre--Moyenneville, a frontage of 17,000 yards,\r\nwith the object of driving the enemy eastwards across the Arras-Bapaume\r\nroad and of forcing him from the Somme area. Tanks were only to operate\r\nbetween Moyenneville and Bucquoy, as the ground south of this frontage\r\nwas unsuited to tank movement; for this reason no tanks were allotted\r\nto the Vth Corps.\r\n\r\nThe allotment of tanks was as follows:\r\n\r\n  VIth Corps   2nd and 3rd Tank Brigades.\r\n  IVth Corps   1st Tank Brigade.\r\n\r\nOwing to the little time available and the necessity for maintaining\r\nsecrecy it was not possible to carry out any training with the\r\ndivisions of the Third Army; many of these, however, had previously\r\nattended demonstrations at Bermicourt, to supplement which notes were\r\nnow issued and as many lectures as possible given prior to this attack.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty was reconnaissance, time for which was most limited.\r\nAgain previous work came to the rescue; for many officers in the Tank\r\nCorps had carefully studied the area of attack prior to the Second\r\nBattle of the Somme and had fought over it during the German spring\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nOn the Fourth Army front the IIIrd Corps, on the left of this Army and\r\nnorth of the river Somme, was to attack between Bray and Albert. The\r\n4th Tank Brigade was to assist in the attack and its machines were\r\nallotted to divisions as follows:\r\n\r\n  4th Battalion  10 tanks to 12th Division.\r\n   „     „        4 tanks to 18th Division.\r\n  5th Battalion  10 tanks to 47th Division.\r\n  1st Battalion  15 tanks to Fourth Army reserve.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Somme the 5th Tank Brigade was ordered to co-operate with\r\nthe Australian Corps on the front Herleville--Chuignolles; the object\r\nof the attack being to capture these villages and the rise running east\r\nof them. Tanks were allotted as follows:\r\n\r\n  8th Battalion   12 tanks to 32nd Division.\r\n  2nd Battalion   12 tanks to 1st Australian Brigade.\r\n  13th Battalion  12 tanks to 2nd Australian Brigade.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bapaume, which began on August 21, is of particular\r\ninterest in that it was the first attack launched against a new\r\ntactical system of defence recently adopted by the enemy, namely, the\r\nholding of his reserves well in rear of a lightly held outpost line. In\r\nconformity with the principles of this system of defence in depth the\r\nGermans had withdrawn their guns behind the Albert-Arras railway; this\r\neventually complicated the tank attack, for had they remained forward,\r\nas so frequently they had heretofore done, they would have been\r\nsurprised and captured during the first phase of the battle; as it was,\r\nthey accounted for many of our machines during the third phase.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the enemy’s new system of defence and the varying\r\npowers of the three marks of machines used by the 1st and 2nd Tank\r\nBrigades, tanks were disposed in echelons as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) Two battalions of Mark IV tanks to operate as far as the second\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n(ii) One battalion of Mark V and one of Mark V star machines to operate\r\nagainst the second objective and proceed as far as the Albert-Arras\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\n(iii) Two battalions of Whippets to operate beyond the Albert-Arras\r\nrailway line.\r\n\r\nZero hour was at 4.55 a.m. The Mark IV battalion moved forward and\r\nsuccessfully cleared the first objective and pushed on towards the\r\nsecond. Once again the attack was a surprise, perhaps not so much\r\nthrough it being unexpected as through the inability of the Germans to\r\nmeet it, especially as their guns had been withdrawn. To illustrate how\r\ncomplete this surprise was it is only necessary to mention that candles\r\nwere found still burning in the trenches when we crossed them, and\r\npapers and equipment scattered broadcast gave evidence of the hurried\r\nflight of the enemy. The second echelon and the Whippets had, however,\r\na far more difficult task to accomplish. The Albert-Arras railway had,\r\nprevious to the attack, been turned into a strongly defended line of\r\nmachine-gun nests covered by the German guns east of it. Unfortunately\r\nthe thick ground mist, which had shielded the approach of the first\r\nechelon, now began to lift; this enabled the German artillery observers\r\nto direct a deadly fire on the tanks, in fact, each individual tank\r\nbecame the centre of a zone of bullets and bursting shells. Avoiding\r\nthese zones, our infantry pushed on with few casualties. During this\r\nday’s fighting many parties of the enemy, some over a hundred strong,\r\nsurrendered _en bloc_ directly the tanks were seen approaching. Such\r\naction on the part of the German infantry was becoming a stereotyped\r\nprocedure in all tank attacks. On the 21st, of the 190 tanks which took\r\npart in the attack, 37 received direct hits.\r\n\r\nOn August 22 the IIIrd Corps launched its attack on a front of some\r\n10,000 yards with complete success. The tanks, which had been\r\ninstructed by the IIIrd Corps to proceed in rear of the infantry, in\r\nactual fact led the attack the whole way, effecting a penetration of\r\nabout 4,000 yards. All objectives were gained, and at the end of the\r\nday our line ran east of Albert, east of Meaulte, east of the Happy\r\nValley, and through the western outskirts of Bray-sur-Somme.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the attack of the IIIrd Corps was continued in\r\nconjunction with that of the Third Army to the north and the Australian\r\nCorps to the south. The IIIrd Corps captured Tara and Usna hills,\r\nemploying six tanks of the 1st Tank Battalion in this action. On the\r\nAustralian front the thirty-six machines of the 5th Tank Brigade\r\ndeployed and led the infantry right on to their objective, which was\r\nsuccessfully occupied. On reaching this the machines of the 2nd and\r\n13th Battalions exploited north of Chuignolles with the 3rd Australian\r\nBrigade, whilst those of the 8th Battalion rallied. During this attack\r\nthe enemy put up a stout resistance, his machine-gunners fighting with\r\ngreat spirit and in many cases continuing to fire their guns until\r\nrun over by the tanks. Curiously enough, in comparison with this, on\r\nthe previous day the enemy’s machine-gunners on the IIIrd Corps front\r\nscarcely put up any fight at all, and when asked why they had not done\r\nso replied: “Oh! it would not have been any good.”\r\n\r\nThe following is a typical battle-history sheet depicting the tank\r\nfighting at this period; it was written by a tank commander who took\r\npart in the above attack.\r\n\r\n  “At 4.25 a.m. on the 23rd instant, I proceeded with my female\r\n  tank ‘Mabel’ (No. 9382) in front of the infantry. I made a very\r\n  zigzag course to the wood in the south-west edge of the village\r\n  of Chuignolles, where I encountered an anti-tank gun which was\r\n  eventually knocked out by the male tank commanded by 2nd Lieut.\r\n  Simmonds, who was operating on my right. I then worked up the\r\n  south side of the village, heavily machine-gunning all the crops\r\n  and copses, and dislodged several machine-gun crews of the enemy.\r\n  I next came back to the village and mopped up the enemy on the\r\n  outskirts until it was clear. Then, emerging from the smoke of\r\n  two shells which dropped short, I found myself in the midst of\r\n  a battery of whizz-bangs. The gunners of this battery I at once\r\n  proceeded to obliterate with good success, after which I came\r\n  behind another battery and proceeded with the same operation. Then\r\n  I started to take infantry over to the high ground south of Square\r\n  wood in L.35d, when I was called back by an Australian colonel to\r\n  attend to some M.G. nests which had been left in the centre of\r\n  the village; here I mopped up twelve M.G. nests and then started\r\n  to catch up the remainder of the tanks and the barrage, but while\r\n  at the top of a very steep bank, approximately R.10.b.30.50, I\r\n  received a direct hit from a whizz-bang on the front horns, which\r\n  sent me out of control to the bottom of the bank, where I found it\r\n  had broken one plate of my left track. After repairing this, the\r\n  barrage having finished, and as tanks were coming back to rally, I\r\n  brought my tank back to the rallying-point at Amy wood.”\r\n\r\nIn the Third Army the attack was re-opened on August 23 by a moonlight\r\noperation, starting at 4 a.m., carried out against the village of\r\nGomiecourt. The 3rd Division, supported by ten Mark IV tanks of the\r\n12th Battalion, attacked this village and carried it. A little later\r\nthe Guards Division with four Mark IV.s captured the village of\r\nHamelincourt.\r\n\r\nAt 11 a.m. the VIth Corps, assisted by fifteen Whippets, attacked in\r\nthe direction of Ervillers--Behagnies--Sapignies, and by noon were\r\neast of the Bapaume-Arras road. Near Sapignies heavy machine-gun\r\nfire was encountered, which prevented our infantry moving forward;\r\nnotwithstanding this the Whippets continued their advance. In one\r\nmachine the officer and sergeant were killed; the remaining man,\r\nhowever, after placing the corpses in a shell-hole, continued\r\nsingle-handed to follow the other tanks, and when a target offered\r\nitself, locked his back axle and fired his Hotchkiss gun. Although\r\nSapignies and Behagnies were not captured the operation was successful\r\nin securing a large number of prisoners. This attack materially\r\nassisted that of the IVth Corps on Achiet-le-Grand and Bihucourt, which\r\nwere captured by the 37th Division and six Mark V tanks of the 1st\r\nTank Brigade.\r\n\r\nAt 5.7 a.m., in spite of a very heavy gas barrage which took place\r\nbetween 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., eighteen tanks of the 11th Battalion and\r\neight of the 9th Battalion co-operated with the 52nd and 56th Divisions\r\nin an attack on the Hamelincourt-Heninel spur. Both these objectives\r\nwere carried with small loss.\r\n\r\nOn August 24 the attacks of the Third and Fourth Armies were pushed\r\nwith vigour, the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Tank Brigades co-operating.\r\n\r\nAt 2 a.m. on the IVth Corps front four Mark IV machines assisted the\r\n37th Division west of Sapignies; later on, seven Mark IV tanks and\r\nnineteen Whippets attacked with the New Zealand and 37th Divisions on\r\nGrevillers, Biefvillers, and Loupart wood, which were captured. On the\r\nfront of the 56th Division a bloody engagement began at 7 a.m. for the\r\nownership of the line St. Leger--Henin-sur-Cojeul, eleven tanks of the\r\n11th Battalion co-operating after an approach march of 10,000 yards.\r\nAll objectives were gained. At 2 p.m. this attack was continued, two\r\ntanks leading the infantry north of Croisilles as far as the Hindenburg\r\nLine, which was strongly held. Both these machines had particularly\r\nexciting experiences. One received a direct hit which rendered the\r\nofficer commanding it unconscious; recovering his senses, he at once\r\ntook charge of his machine and pushed on. In the other the crew were\r\nforced to evacuate the tank on account of the enemy surrounding it\r\nwith phosphorus bombs; before leaving it the officer in command turned\r\nthe tank’s head towards home and then, getting out, walked between\r\nthe front horns of the machine until the fumes had cleared away. All\r\nthis time the tank was surrounded by the enemy. This attack failed; it\r\nis interesting, however, to note that one tank of the 11th Battalion\r\ncovered during this operation 40,000 yards in some twenty-six hours.\r\n\r\nAt 3.30 p.m. five tanks of the 9th Battalion took part in an attack\r\non the line Mory copse--Camouflage copse. At first there was not much\r\nopposition, but after Mory copse was reached the enemy put up a stout\r\nresistance and, refusing to surrender, was killed almost to a man,\r\none party of about sixty being put out of action by four rounds of\r\n6-pounder case shot.\r\n\r\nAt dawn this day on the Fourth Army front five tanks of the 1st\r\nBattalion assisted the 47th Division in the recapture of the Happy\r\nValley, which had been lost on the previous afternoon. This attack was\r\nentirely successful, and besides the Happy Valley the extensive village\r\nof Bray was added to our gains.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of August 24 the 3rd Tank Brigade was transferred\r\nfrom the Third Army to the Canadian Corps of the First Army for the\r\nforthcoming attack on the First Army front, which was to initiate the\r\nSecond Battle of Arras. This entailed a lengthy night march of 29,000\r\nyards from Blaireville and Boisleux-au-Mont to Moyenneville, thence to\r\nAchicourt.\r\n\r\nOn August 25 minor tank attacks were carried out on the IVth Corps\r\nfront against Favreuil, Avesnes, Thilloy, and Sapignies, and on the\r\n26th tanks of the 9th Battalion, some of which had moved 37,000 yards\r\nsince the night of the 24th-25th, attacked with the Guards Division\r\nnorth of Mory. This attack was not a great success, due to the dense\r\nmist, which made co-operation almost impossible and the maintenance\r\nof direction most difficult. During this engagement one tank had five\r\nmembers of its crew wounded by anti-tank rifle bullets.\r\n\r\nOn the Canadian Corps’ front an attack was carried out opposite Fampoux\r\nand Neuville-Vitasse, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions operating with\r\ntanks of the 9th and 11th Divisions against Wancourt, Guemappe, and\r\nMonchy-le-Preux. Near Monchy several tanks were knocked out, the crews\r\njoining the infantry to repel a local counter-attack. The sergeant of\r\none crew, hearing that the enemy had captured his tank, collected his\r\nmen and charged forward to recover it, arriving at one sponson door of\r\nthe machine as the enemy were scrambling out of the opposite one.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the 27th, operations continued east of\r\nMonchy-le-Preux, and in the Guemappe-Cherisy area, but ceased\r\naltogether as far as tanks were concerned until the 29th. On this\r\nday minor tank operations were carried out on the Third Army front\r\nsouth-west of Beugnatre by the 1st Brigade, the enemy having evacuated\r\nThilloy and Bapaume. This Brigade, on the 30th, co-operated with the\r\n5th British and New Zealand Divisions against Fremicourt, Beugny,\r\nBancourt, Haplincourt, and Velu wood, whilst the 2nd Tank Brigade\r\nattacked Vaux-Vraucourt. All these attacks were successful.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of August 1918, probably the most decisive month\r\nin the whole war, nine Mark IV.s of the 12th Battalion and four\r\nWhippets of the 6th Battalion attacked the Longatte trench, Moreuil\r\nswitch, and Vraucourt trench, taking all these objectives, and on the\r\nfollowing day, September 1, Whippets of the 6th Battalion completed the\r\nabove operations by establishing the infantry on the slopes east of\r\nVaux-Vraucourt.\r\n\r\nThe Second Battle of Arras reached its zenith on September 2 when the\r\nfamous Drocourt-Queant line, which we had failed to reach in April\r\n1917, was broken. Starting from the south the 1st Tank Brigade operated\r\nwith the 42nd and 5th Divisions against Beugny and Villars-au-Flos.\r\nTo the north of this attack the 2nd Tank Brigade assisted in the VIth\r\nCorps operations against Moreuil, Lagnicourt, and Morchies. This attack\r\nwas made in conjunction with those of the Canadian and XVIIth Corps\r\nagainst the Drocourt-Queant line. This line was attacked by the 1st\r\nand 4th Canadian Divisions and the 4th Division, together with as many\r\ntanks as the 9th, 11th, and 14th Battalions of the 3rd Tank Brigade\r\ncould muster. The assembly of these machines was difficult owing not\r\nonly to the intricate nature of the Sensée valley but to the fact that\r\nactive operations were taking place throughout these preparations.\r\n\r\nThe Drocourt-Queant line, built in the spring of 1917, was protected\r\nby immensely strong belts of wire entanglement, and it was expected\r\nthat every effort would be made on the part of the enemy to hold these\r\ndefences at all cost; nevertheless, on the whole, less opposition was\r\nencountered than had been anticipated. Except for anti-tank rifle fire,\r\nwhich was especially noticeable at Villers-les-Cagnicourt, the tanks\r\nmet little opposition. It is estimated that in this attack one company\r\nof tanks alone destroyed over seventy hostile machine guns, the German\r\ngunners surrendering to the tanks as they approached.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the enemy falling back, the Whippet tanks pushed\r\nforward to Hermies and Dermicourt. Thus the Second Battle of Arras\r\nended in an overwhelming success by the piercing of the renowned\r\nDrocourt-Queant line. A blow had now been delivered from which the\r\nenemy’s moral never recovered.\r\n\r\nSince August 21, in all, 511 tanks had been in action, and except\r\nfor one or two minor failures every attack had culminated in a cheap\r\nsuccess--cheap as regards our own infantry casualties, especially so\r\nwhen it is remembered that during the fortnight which comprised the\r\nbattle of Bapaume and the Second Battle of Arras no fewer than 470 guns\r\nand 53,000 prisoners were captured. Thus in a little less than one\r\nmonth the German Army had lost to the First, Third, and Fourth British\r\nArmies 870 guns and 75,000 men without counting killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nGERMAN ANTI-TANK TACTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom September 1916 onwards to the conclusion of the war, German\r\nanti-tank tactics passed through three phases. Firstly, the enemy\r\nhad no anti-tank defence at all, or what he devised he based upon a\r\nmisconception of what the tank could accomplish. Secondly, having\r\nlearnt but little about tanks, he considered that only a small\r\nexpenditure of effort and matériel was required to deal with weapons of\r\nso limited a scope. Thirdly, from August 1918 onwards, he took panic\r\nand over-estimated their powers; his efforts at anti-tank defence\r\nbecame feverish and he appeared to be willing to make any and every\r\nsacrifice to combat this terrible weapon.\r\n\r\nCaptured documents clearly show that the introduction of tanks was\r\nas great a surprise to the German General Staff as to their fighting\r\ntroops. It is true that certain vague rumours had been circulated\r\nthat the Allies might use some new weapon, but, as such rumours have\r\nthroughout the war been current on all sides, no particular importance\r\nwas attached to them. In spite of the fact that tanks were used on\r\nseveral occasions between September 15 and November 13, 1916, and that\r\nthe enemy held in his possession near Gueudecourt a captured tank for\r\nsome fourteen days, he formed a most inaccurate idea of it.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1916 and 1917 instructions were issued on\r\nanti-tank defence. These were based on the following entirely erroneous\r\nideas:\r\n\r\n(i) That tanks were largely dependent on roads.\r\n\r\n(ii) That tanks would approach the German lines in daylight.\r\n\r\n(iii) That tanks were impervious to machine-gun fire.\r\n\r\nThese led to the Germans depending on road obstacles such as pits and\r\nindirect artillery fire; as a matter of fact, at this time the most\r\npotent weapon which could have been used against tanks was the machine\r\ngun firing A.P. bullets. That the Mark I tank was not proof against\r\nthese bullets was not discovered until April 1917, after the British\r\nfailure at Bullecourt. This discovery was of little use, for by the\r\ntime the next battle was fought, Messines, a tank with thicker armour,\r\nthe Mark IV, had replaced the Mark I.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that throughout this period the German Higher Command\r\ngave little thought to the tank question and quite failed to appreciate\r\nthe possibilities of the machine. Prisoners were questioned and rough\r\nsketches, many grotesque in the extreme, were obtained from them\r\nand published for information. What information they imparted was\r\nmisleading; in fact, the whole attitude of the German General Staff,\r\nduring this period, may be summed up as “stupidity tempered with\r\nridicule.”\r\n\r\nDuring 1917 the German grew to realise that artillery formed the chief\r\ndefence against tanks. Great prominence was given to indirect fire by\r\nall types of guns and howitzers, and in spite of several dawn attacks\r\nthe enemy laid great stress on what he called “Distant Defence.” As\r\nactual operations proved, indirect artillery fire produced little\r\neffect save on broken-down machines. Partially learning this, the\r\nGermans resorted to special anti-tank guns, and on an average, two,\r\nprotected by concrete, were emplaced on each divisional front; these\r\nwere in certain sectors supplemented by captured Belgian and old German\r\nguns. Fixed anti-tank guns proved, however, of little use, for though\r\na few tanks were knocked out by them, notably at Glencorse wood on the\r\nfirst day of the Third Battle of Ypres, they generally were destroyed\r\nby our terrific initial bombardments. Curiously enough, though both\r\nindirect fire and fixed guns proved a failure, little consideration\r\nwas, at this time, given to the simplest form of artillery action\r\nagainst tanks, namely--direct fire by field guns.\r\n\r\nInfantry anti-tank defence, during 1917, was negligible and chiefly\r\nconsisted in instructions how to “keep its head” and to leave the rest\r\nto the artillery; the use of bundles of stick bombs was recommended,\r\nand though A.P. bullets received no great support, the effect of the\r\nsplash of ordinary S.A.A. was not realised in the least degree.\r\n\r\nPrior to the battle of Cambrai (November 1917) the true anti-tank\r\ndefence had been mud, mud produced by gun fire and rain. At this battle\r\nthe enemy was caught completely unawares, his anti-tank defence was\r\nslight; but a feature of the operation was the improvised defence put\r\nup by a few of the enemy’s field guns, which inflicted heavy casualties\r\non tanks, especially at Flesquières. In general, however, the enemy\r\nrealised the ineffectiveness of his anti-tank defence, yet curiously\r\nenough he at present showed no decided inclination to adopt direct\r\nfield-gun fire as its backbone. In spite of the fact that the incident\r\nof a German battery, served by an officer, putting a considerable\r\nnumber of tanks out of action had received mention in the British\r\ndispatches, still the enemy remained oblivious to the utility of direct\r\nfire, and in place of praising his gunners, as we did, he praised\r\ntroops from Posen who had put up a determined resistance against tanks\r\nin Fontaine Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nThe German counter-attack on November 30, 1917, which resulted in the\r\ncapture of a considerable number of tanks, seems to have entirely\r\nallayed any anxiety created by the attack on the 20th; for though the\r\nquestion of anti-tank defence was given rather more prominence than\r\nheretofore, no greater practical attention was paid to it during the\r\nwinter of 1917-1918 than during the one previous to it.\r\n\r\nThe German offensive in the spring of 1918 put all defensive questions\r\ninto the background. This period, however, produced a new weapon, the\r\nGerman anti-tank rifle.\r\n\r\nThis rifle was first captured during the battle of Hamel on July 4. It\r\nhad only just been issued to certain divisions; other divisions were\r\nequipped with it later on.\r\n\r\nThis weapon was 5 ft. 6 in. in length, it weighed 36 lb. and fired\r\nsingle shots, using A.P. ammunition of ·530 calibre. It was too\r\nconspicuous and too slow a weapon to be really effective against\r\ntanks, though it could easily penetrate them at several hundred yards\r\nrange. Its chief disadvantage was that the German soldier would not\r\nuse it; not only was he not trained to do so, but he was afraid of its\r\nkick, and still more afraid of the tanks themselves. It is doubtful if\r\n1 per cent. of the anti-tank rifles captured in our tank attacks had\r\never been fired at all.\r\n\r\nThe French counter-attack between the Aisne and the Marne in July,\r\nfollowed by the British victories of Amiens and Bapaume in August,\r\nstruck through the opacity of the German General Staff like a bolt from\r\nout the blue, with a result that a complete _volte face_ was made as\r\nregards tanks. The instructions now issued gave anti-tank defence the\r\nfirst place in every project; the eyes of General Ludendorff were now\r\nopened, and, realising the seriousness of the tank problem, on July 22\r\nhe wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n  “The utmost attention must be paid to combat tanks--our earlier\r\n  successes against tanks lead to a certain contempt for this weapon\r\n  of warfare. We must, however, now reckon with more dangerous tanks.”\r\n\r\nThis is a more human document than those subsequently issued by the\r\nGerman Chief of the General Staff. Ludendorff now clearly realised that\r\nanti-tank defence had been neglected; he probably realised also that\r\nthis neglect would be difficult to explain to the army and the public,\r\nwhich, as a result of failures, were about to become far more critical\r\nof their leaders than ever before.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear, however, whether Ludendorff realised a still more\r\nserious aspect of the tank problem, namely, that it was now too late to\r\norganise an efficient defence against the “more dangerous tanks.” Such\r\na defence might have been created before these tanks were available in\r\neffective numbers; it could not be organised now unless the pressure\r\nthe Allies were now exerting could be relieved. This was impossible,\r\nfor the motive force of this pressure was the tank.\r\n\r\nThe steps which the German General Staff now took to combat the tank\r\nare interesting. Special officers were appointed to the staffs of\r\nGroups of Armies, Corps, Divisions, and Brigades, whose sole duty it\r\nwas to deal with anti-tank defence within these formations. The field\r\ngun was at length recognised as the most efficient anti-tank weapon\r\navailable. These guns were organised as follows:\r\n\r\n(i) A few forward and silent guns in each divisional sector--outpost\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n(ii) Sections from batteries in reserve were allotted definite sectors.\r\nOn a tank attack taking place, they would gallop forward and engage any\r\ntank entering the sector allotted to the section. These sections of\r\nguns proved the backbone of the German anti-tank defence.\r\n\r\n(iii) All batteries (howitzers included) were ordered to take up\r\npositions from which advancing tanks could be engaged by _direct fire_.\r\nThe most effective range for this purpose was first considered to be\r\nover 1,000 yards; this was gradually reduced to about 500.\r\n\r\nBatteries in (i) and (ii) were to be employed for anti-tank work only,\r\nin (iii) they were available for other work, but in the event of a tank\r\nattack the engagement of tanks was their chief task.\r\n\r\nThe duty still allotted to the infantry was “to keep their heads” or\r\n“to keep calm,” actions which at this period were impossible to the\r\nGerman Higher Command directly tanks were mentioned. Other orders laid\r\ndown that in the event of a tank attack “infantry should move to a\r\nflank.” How this was to be done when tanks were attacking on frontages\r\nof twenty to thirty miles was not explained. A.P. ammunition had to a\r\ngreat extent fallen into discredit, and, curious to record, the effect\r\nof “splash” as a means of blinding a tank was still hardly realised,\r\nand this after two years of tank warfare.\r\n\r\nAs artificial obstacles had proved of little use from the end of July,\r\nwhen the Germans withdrew behind the rivers Ancre and Avre, until the\r\nsigning of the armistice every effort was made to use river lines as a\r\ndefence against tanks. Road obstacles and stockades were still in use,\r\nbut though they proved a hindrance to the movement of armoured cars\r\nthey proved none to tanks.\r\n\r\nA great deal of energy and explosive material was expended in laying\r\nminefields. At first, special mines in the form of a shallow box were\r\nused; later on these were replaced by shells. Lack of time, however,\r\nprevented the enemy from developing sufficiently large minefields to\r\nproduce an important result.\r\n\r\nThe idea of combining the various forms of anti-tank defence under one\r\ncommand in such a way as to form an anti-tank fort had been dealt with\r\non paper, but was only in a very few cases put into practice. The idea\r\nwas a sound one, and if well combined with natural obstacles it would\r\nhave formed the best defence against tanks that the enemy could have\r\ncreated with the means at his disposal.\r\n\r\nAn anti-tank fort was to consist of:\r\n\r\nFour field guns, 2 flat-trajectory minenwerfer, 4 anti-tank rifles, and\r\n2 machine guns firing A.P. ammunition. The fort was to be sited several\r\nthousand yards behind the outpost guns and close to the main line of\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nThroughout the last two years of the war occasional successes were\r\ngained by the Germans by various means of anti-tank defence, these\r\nusually being due to a combination of the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n(i) The use of tanks outside their limitation.\r\n\r\n(ii) A hitch or failure in carrying out the plan of attack.\r\n\r\n(iii) An exceptional display of resource, initiative, and courage on\r\nthe part of some individual German soldier.\r\n\r\nIn general the keynote of the German anti-tank defence was lack of\r\nforesight, the development of tanks not being appreciated. Among the\r\nvery large number of captured orders dealing with anti-tank defence\r\nthere is no recorded instance of any anticipation of superior types\r\nof tanks to those already in use. The German General Staff lacked\r\nimagination and the faculty of appreciating the value of weapons that\r\nhad not been explained to them whilst at school; obsolescence dimmed\r\ntheir foresight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLES OF EPEHY AND CAMBRAI--ST. QUENTIN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 4 all Tank Brigades were withdrawn from Armies and placed\r\nin G.H.Q. reserve to refit and reorganise. When this had been completed\r\nTank Brigades were constituted as follows:\r\n\r\n  1st Tank Brigade          7th Battalion            Mark IV.\r\n                           11th    „                 Mark V Star.\r\n                           12th    „                 Mark IV.\r\n                           15th    „                 Mark V Star.\r\n\r\n  2nd Tank Brigade         10th    „                 Mark V.\r\n                           14th    „                 Mark V.\r\n\r\n  3rd Tank Brigade          3rd    „                 Medium A.\r\n                            6th    „                 Medium A.\r\n                            9th    „                 Mark V.\r\n                           17th    „                 Armoured cars.\r\n\r\n  4th Tank Brigade          1st    „                 Mark V.\r\n                            4th    „                 Mark V.\r\n                            5th    „                 Mark V.\r\n                          301st American Battalion   Mark V Star.\r\n\r\n  5th Tank Brigade          2nd Battalion            Mark V.\r\n                            8th     „                Mark V.\r\n                           13th     „                Mark V.\r\n\r\nAt 7 a.m. on September 17, in a heavy storm of rain, the Fourth and\r\nThird Armies initiated the battle of Epehy by attacking on a front of\r\nsome seventeen miles from Holnon to Gouzeaucourt, the First French Army\r\nco-operating south of Holnon.\r\n\r\nOn September 18 the 4th and 5th Tank Brigades were released from G.H.Q.\r\nreserve and allotted to the Fourth Army, the 2nd Tank Battalion having\r\nbeen transferred to this Army on September 13.\r\n\r\nOn this day the battle of Epehy continued on the front Epehy-Villeret,\r\nsome 7,000 yards long. In this attack twenty tanks of the 2nd Battalion\r\nassisted the IIIrd Corps, Australian Corps, and IXth Corps. On the\r\nIIIrd Corps front heavy machine-gun fire was encountered and overcome,\r\nmany machine guns being destroyed. On that of the IXth progress was\r\nslow, and the Australians, meeting with little resistance, captured\r\nRonssoy and Hargicourt.\r\n\r\nAfter two days’ rest the attack was continued on the 21st, nine tanks\r\nof the 2nd Battalion operating on the IIIrd Corps front against the\r\nKnoll and Guillemont farm. Two of these machines carried forward\r\ninfantry, but the machine-gun fire was so heavy that it was not\r\npossible to drop them. During this day the enemy put up a most\r\ndetermined resistance and there were not sufficient tanks engaged\r\nto silence his machine guns. Another two days’ rest followed, and\r\nthen again was the attack renewed on the IXth Corps front against\r\nFresnoy-le-Petit and the Quadrilateral, nineteen machines of the 13th\r\nBattalion attacking with the 1st and 6th Divisions. So heavy was the\r\nenemy’s gas barrage on this day that some of the tank crews were forced\r\nto wear their respirators for over two hours on end. In spite of the\r\nenemy being in great strength eighteen machines assisted the infantry.\r\nThus ended the battle of Epehy and though the advance was not great\r\nnearly 12,000 prisoners and 100 guns were added to the “bag.”\r\n\r\nPreparations were now set in hand for an extensive attack against the\r\nHindenburg and auxiliary lines of defence, which together formed a zone\r\nof entrenchments for the most part very heavily wired and extending\r\nover a depth varying from 8,000 to 16,000 yards. This attack entailed\r\nanother hasty reorganisation of tank battalions, which was completed by\r\nSeptember 26, when the battle order of Brigades was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _1st Tank Brigade_     7th Battalion    Mark IV      Bullecourt.\r\n    H.Q. Bihucourt      11th    „         Mark V Star  Barastre.\r\n                        12th    „         Mark IV      W. of Ruyaulcourt.\r\n                         1st T.S. Coy.

Coy.                 S. of Tincourt.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which these changes were made would, a few months\r\nback, have bewildered both the Tank Corps Headquarter Staff and the\r\nBrigade and Battalion Commanders themselves; now the knack of rapid\r\nmovement had been mastered, and though great energy had to be exerted\r\nduring such reorganisations, they were generally accomplished in time\r\nand efficiently.\r\n\r\nOn September 27 the great battle began, comprising the First, Third,\r\nand Fourth Armies on a front of sixteen miles. The battlefield was\r\ndivided into two main sectors, to the north that of the First and Third\r\nArmies, between the Sensée river and Gouzeaucourt, with the object of\r\ncapturing Bourlon hill, and to the south that of the Fourth Army with\r\nthe capture of the Knoll, Guillemont farm, and Quennemont farm as its\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nEast of the First Army front line ran the canal Du Nord, a formidable\r\nobstacle to tanks in spite of the fact that it was dry, having never\r\nbeen completed. This canal varied from 36 to 50 ft. wide at the bottom,\r\nand was 12 ft. deep, and the slopes of its sides were in many places\r\nsteep. The enemy, evidently suspecting that tanks might attempt to\r\ncross it, had at certain places rendered this temporarily impossible,\r\nso it was thought, by cutting in its bank a vertical wall 9 ft.\r\ndeep for several hundreds of yards along the eastern side between\r\nMœuvres and Inchy. In the Maquion-Bourlon sector the enemy had made\r\nlittle anti-tank preparation, probably considering that the canal\r\nitself formed a sufficient obstacle. In the Beaucamp sector, however,\r\nanti-tank preparations were exceptionally thorough, many anti-tank\r\nrifles being placed in position here.\r\n\r\nSixteen tanks of the 7th Battalion, all Mark IV.s, some of which had\r\nfought over very nearly the same ground in November 1917, were allotted\r\nto co-operate with the Canadian Corps. In spite of the formidable great\r\nditch which lay in front of them, fifteen of these machines crossed\r\nthe canal Du Nord near Mœuvres, and attacked Bourlon village and the\r\nwestern edge of Bourlon wood. Of these fifteen machines only three were\r\nput out of action, one by a mine placed in a road leading through a gap\r\nin the canal and two by a battery near Deligny hill.\r\n\r\nOn the Third Army front Corps were disposed from north to south as\r\nfollows: XVIIth, VIth, IVth, and Vth Corps.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six tanks of the 15th Battalion operated with the XVIIth Corps\r\nsouth of Bourlon wood, and with the VIth Corps against Flesquières and\r\nPremy Chapel. A fine performance was here carried out in crossing the\r\ncanal, and although more than one attempt had to be made by several of\r\nthe tanks the 9 ft. wall was successfully surmounted. This attack was\r\nan overwhelming success in spite of the heavy tank casualties, 11 out\r\nof the 26 machines operating being hit on the extreme objectives. On\r\nthe IVth Corps front 12 machines of the 11th Battalion attacked between\r\nGouzeaucourt and Trescault: this operation was, however, only partially\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nOn the front of the Fourth Army the 27th American Division, supported\r\nby twelve tanks of the 4th Tank Battalion, carried out a preparatory\r\nattack on the Knoll, Guillemont and Quennemont farms, the object being\r\nto advance the front line so as to be in a better position to attack in\r\nforce on the 29th. The Germans holding this sector of their line were\r\nreliable and well led troops, and in spite of the fact that the tanks\r\nand infantry reached their objectives a counter-attack drove them back,\r\nwith the result that up to zero-hour on the 29th the actual location of\r\nour front line was very uncertain.\r\n\r\nOn September 28 a small local attack, which was completely successful,\r\nwas carried out against Raillencourt and St. Olle; in this six tanks of\r\nthe 7th Battalion took part.\r\n\r\nOn the following day seven tanks of the 11th Battalion co-operated with\r\nthe Vth Corps in the capture of Gonnelieu and Villers Guislain in spite\r\nof strong resistance put up by the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the Fourth Army front an important battle of considerable magnitude\r\nwas fought on the 29th, involving some 175 tanks. The object of this\r\nbattle was to force the Hindenburg Line between Bellenglise and\r\nVendhuile. Along this front is situated the St. Quentin canal, and as,\r\nbetween Bellicourt and Vendhuile, this canal runs underground through\r\na tunnel, it provided the German garrisons of this sector of their\r\nline with good underground cover. An operation on this sector had been\r\nthe subject of careful study by the Tank Corps General Staff both in\r\nEngland and France ever since the summer of 1917, as this tunnel and\r\na shorter one just north of St. Quentin provide the only negotiable\r\napproaches for tanks over the canal. It was fully realised that the\r\nenemy would put up a most determined resistance to secure his retention\r\nof the tunnel, for should it be occupied by us the whole of the\r\nHindenburg defences north and south of it would be threatened.\r\n\r\nThe attack was to be carried out by four Corps, the IXth Corps on the\r\nright, the American and Australian Corps in the centre, and the IIIrd\r\nCorps on the left.\r\n\r\nThe American Corps was to capture the first objective, the strongly\r\nentrenched system east of Bony; the Australian Corps was then to pass\r\nthrough the gap made and be followed by the American Corps exploiting\r\nnorth and south. The IXth Corps was to clear the west bank of the\r\nSt. Quentin canal under cover of the southern wing of the American\r\nexploitation force, whilst the IIIrd Corps was to move forward with the\r\nleft of the American Corps.\r\n\r\nTanks were allotted to Corps as follows:\r\n\r\n3rd Tank Brigade, 5th, 6th, and 9th Battalions, to the IXth Corps.\r\n\r\n4th Tank Brigade, 1st, 4th, and 301st American Battalion, to the\r\nAustralian Corps.\r\n\r\n5th Tank Brigade, 8th, 13th, and 16th Battalions, in Army reserve.\r\n\r\nThe 301st American Battalion was attached for operations to the 27th\r\nAmerican Division.\r\n\r\nA thick mist covered the ground when the tanks moved forward at 5.50\r\na.m. It will be remembered that the situation opposite the Knoll\r\nand the two farms of Guillemont and Quennemont was very obscure.\r\nThis attack, which was to break the well sited and highly organised\r\nHindenburg Line, was necessarily a “set piece” attack in which\r\nobjectives, allotment of tanks, etc., had to be carefully worked out\r\nbeforehand. The plan of operations was based on the assumption that\r\nthe line--the Knoll--Guillemont farm--Quennemont farm--would form the\r\n“jumping off” line. The resistance put up by the enemy in this sector\r\nwas far greater than ordinary, with the result that up to the time of\r\nthe attack the above line was still in German hands. This meant that\r\nthe artillery programme would have to be hastily changed or left as it\r\nwas. The latter course was decided on so as to obviate confusion, and\r\nthis necessitated the infantry attackers starting at a considerable\r\ndistance in rear of the protective barrage. As events turned out the\r\ntask set the Americans proved too severe, nevertheless with great\r\ngallantry they pushed forward, some of them actually forcing their way\r\nthrough the German defences. The majority, however, were mown down by\r\nthe exceptionally heavy machine-gun fire which was brought to bear on\r\nthem. The attack failed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the 301st American Tank Battalion met with a disaster,\r\nfor, whilst moving forward from near Ronssoy, it ran into an old\r\nBritish minefield west of Guillemont farm laid in the previous\r\nFebruary; ten machines were blown up and only two succeeded in\r\nassisting the infantry. This minefield consisted of rows of buried\r\n2 in. trench-mortar bombs, each containing 50 lb. of ammonal; the\r\nexplosions were terrific, the whole bottom of many machines being torn\r\nout; in nearly all cases the crews of these tanks suffered very heavy\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\nIn the south, tanks of the 4th and 5th Brigades cleared Nauroy and\r\nBellicourt and broke through the Hindenburg Line. The mist now began\r\nto lift, and consequent on the failure of the northern attack, the\r\nattackers were placed, tactically, in a very dangerous situation, for\r\nthe enemy was now able to fire into their backs. Several tanks, which\r\nhad been allotted to later objectives, on realising the seriousness of\r\nthe situation went into action on their own initiative without either\r\nartillery or infantry support. This very gallant action undoubtedly\r\nsaved a great many infantry casualties, though the tanks themselves\r\nsuffered heavy losses.\r\n\r\nOn the right the attack of the IXth Corps was a complete success; in\r\nthe first rush the 46th Division crossed the canal, a magnificent\r\nperformance, and captured Magny and Etricourt with 4,000 prisoners. The\r\ntanks operating with this Corps, being unable to cross with the troops,\r\nwho waded and swam the water in the canal, moved on Bellicourt, a\r\ndifficult operation in the dense fog. From this place they swung south,\r\nworking down the bank of the canal, and arrived in time to take part\r\nin the capture of Magny. During this action the enemy’s artillery fire\r\nproved very accurate; which was, however, to be expected, for this was\r\nthe third tank assault on the Knoll--Guillemont--Quennemont position;\r\nconsequently the German gunners had become thoroughly drilled in the\r\ndefence of this sector.\r\n\r\nOn the following day eighteen tanks of the 13th Battalion worked up\r\nthe Hindenburg and the Nauroy--Le Catelet lines, but on account of\r\nsome misunderstanding the infantry did not follow, consequently the\r\noperation did not prove of much value.\r\n\r\nOn the First Army front six tanks of the 9th Battalion operated with\r\nthe 3rd and 4th Canadian Divisions against Cuvillers, Blecourt, and\r\nTilloy; they crossed the Douai-Cambrai road near Sancourt and greatly\r\nhelped the infantry by overcoming the determined machine-gun resistance\r\nwhich was encountered throughout this attack. On the next day further\r\ntanks of this Battalion assisted the 32nd Division in occupying the\r\nFonsomme line east of Joncourt. In this action smoke clouds were used\r\nfrom tanks to cover their approach from the observation of the German\r\ngunners; this proved very successful and undoubtedly reduced loss by\r\ngun fire. One tank had a curious experience: a smoke bomb having burst\r\non the top of it, the crew were forced to evacuate the machine on\r\naccount of the fumes being drawn inside. The tank commander, having\r\nput the fire out, was unable to find his crew; as time was short\r\nhe got inside the tank and continued his advance alone; on his way\r\nforward he took on board an officer and two men of the Manchester\r\nRegiment. The tank then went into action against a machine-gun nest;\r\nas the improvised crew was ignorant of the Hotchkiss gun each time\r\na jam occurred the tank commander had to leave the driver’s seat to\r\nrectify it. Shortly afterwards the truant crew turned up, so the tank\r\ncommander, having first driven his newly-made comrades to cover,\r\ndropped them, and then proceeded on his way.\r\n\r\nOn October 3 an attack was launched against the Sequehart-Bony front\r\nin which twenty machines of the 5th Tank Brigade proved of very great\r\nassistance to the 32nd and 46th Divisions. Sequehart was cleared and so\r\nwas Ramicourt and Doon copse, but Montbrehain remained uncaptured.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th, the 3rd Tank Battalion was transferred from the 5th to the\r\n3rd Tank Brigade, and a day later the 16th Tank Battalion from the\r\n5th to the 4th Tank Brigade. The 8th, 9th, and 18th Battalions were\r\nwithdrawn into G.H.Q. reserve. On the 5th the first phase of the battle\r\nof Cambrai--St. Quentin opened with a failure to take Beaurevoir in\r\nwhich attack six tanks of the 4th Tank Battalion attempted to assist\r\nthe 25th Division. Co-operation in this action was indifferent, due\r\nchiefly to the fact that the infantry of this division had never been\r\ntrained to work with tanks. This failure was partially retrieved by\r\na brilliantly executed attack by the Australians supported by twelve\r\ntanks of the 16th Battalion against Montbrehain. This village was held\r\nby the enemy in strength, and many good targets at close quarters were\r\nobtained for 6-pounders firing case shot. The co-operation throughout\r\nwas excellent, as, since the battle of Hamel, had always been the case\r\nwhen operating with the Australian Corps--tank commanders constantly\r\ngetting out of their tanks and talking to the infantry.\r\n\r\nThe second phase of the Cambrai--St. Quentin battle opened on the\r\nmorning of October 8 on an eighteen miles front--it was entirely\r\nsuccessful. Tanks were allotted as follows, eighty-two in all being\r\nused:\r\n\r\n  1st Tank Brigade  12th Battalion            1 Company to IVth Corps.\r\n                                              1 Company to VIth Corps.\r\n                                              1 Company to XVIIth Corps.\r\n                    11th Battalion            To Vth Corps.\r\n\r\n  4th Tank Brigade   1st Battalion            To XIIIth Corps.\r\n                   301st American Battalion   To IInd American Corps.\r\n\r\n  3rd Tank Brigade    3rd Battalion           To IInd American Corps.\r\n                      6th Battalion           To IXth Corps.\r\n\r\nThe attacks, carried out by the 12th Tank Battalion on the front\r\nNiergnies--La Targette, were successful, the infantry universally\r\ntestifying to the assistance rendered by this battalion. An interesting\r\nencounter now took place, the enemy counter-attacking from the\r\ndirection of Awoingt with four captured British Mark IV tanks, one male\r\nand three females. The counter-attack was speedily dealt with, the\r\nrenegade male being knocked out by a 6-pounder shell fired by one of\r\nour own tanks and one female put out of action by a shell fired from a\r\ncaptured German field gun by a tank section commander; the remaining\r\ntwo females fled on the approach of one of our machines of the same\r\nsex. So ended the second tank encounter as successfully as the first,\r\nwhich it will be remembered was fought near the village of Cachy on\r\nApril 24, 1918.\r\n\r\nThe other actions fought on this day were briefly as follows:\r\n\r\nOne Company of the 11th Battalion assisted the 32nd Division against\r\nVillers-Outreaux, another company operated with the 21st Division\r\nand the third company with the 38th. This last company was of great\r\nassistance, as the infantry had been held up by a broad belt of wire\r\nwhich they were unable to cross until the tanks crushed down pathways\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Tank Battalion, operating with the IInd American Corps, carried\r\nout its programme, one of its machines putting three batteries of field\r\nguns out of action in Fraicourt wood; and the 3rd Battalion came into\r\naction in the neighbourhood of Serain. This village was very strongly\r\ndefended, the enemy holding it to cover his withdrawal.\r\n\r\nOn October 9 the attack continued along the whole front, eight tanks\r\nof the 4th Battalion coming into action east of Premont and the 17th\r\nArmoured Car Battalion, under orders of the Cavalry Corps, operating\r\naround Maurois and Honnechy. Two days later, on the 11th, five tanks\r\nof the 5th Battalion operated with the 6th Division north of Riguerval\r\nwood; this was the last tank action fought in this battle.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Cambrai--St. Quentin was at an end. The Hindenburg Line\r\nhad now to all intents and purposes ceased to exist as an obstacle. It\r\nhad been broken on a front of nearly thirty miles, on which frontage\r\na penetration of some twenty miles had been effected, and no fewer\r\nthan 630 guns and 48,000 prisoners captured during the last fourteen\r\ndays. The effect of this great battle, coupled with the successes of\r\nthe French in the south and the operations east of Ypres and round\r\nCourtrai, fought by the British, French, and Belgians in the north,\r\nresulted in the withdrawal of the German forces in the Roubaix, Lille,\r\nand Douai area, and with this withdrawal the whole of the British\r\nforces in France from north of Menin to Bohain, seven miles north-west\r\nof Guise, were faced with field warfare; open country stretched before\r\nthem, uncut by trench, unhung by wire. The period of exploitation\r\nhad arrived--that period all our endeavours had been concentrated on\r\nattaining during four years of the most desperate and relentless war in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nConsidering the comparative weakness of the British Army, the time of\r\nthe year, and the nature of the fighting, it had truly been a notable\r\nperformance on the part of the English and the Dominion infantry, to\r\nhave fought their way so far. To carry out a rapid pursuit was beyond\r\ntheir endeavours, for the German Army, though beaten, was not yet\r\nbroken. For cavalry to do so was unthinkable, for the German rearguards\r\npossessed many thousands of machine guns, and as long as these weapons\r\nexisted, pursuit, as cavalry dream it to be, is utterly impossible.\r\nOne arm alone could have turned the present defeat into a rout--the\r\ntank, but few of these remained, for since August 8 no fewer than 819\r\nmachines had been handed over to Salvage by the tank battalions, and\r\nthese battalions themselves had lost in personnel 550 officers and\r\n2,557 other ranks, a small number indeed when compared with the number\r\nof actions the Corps had been engaged in, yet a severe loss out of a\r\nfighting state of some 1,500 officers and 8,000 other ranks.\r\n\r\nHad it been possible at this crisis to put into the field two fresh\r\nbrigades of medium tanks, that is about 300 machines, the cost of which\r\nwould be approximately £1,500,000, or one-fifth that of one day’s\r\ncost of the war, the greatest war in all history might have closed\r\non or near the field of Waterloo in a decisive victory ending in an\r\nunconditional surrender or an irretrievable rout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE U.S.A. TANK CORPS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 1917, the United States of America entered the Great War.\r\nUp to this date tanks had not accomplished much. British machines had\r\ntaken part in the battles of the Somme and Ancre, and the first French\r\nones had made their appearance on the training ground in October 1916.\r\n\r\nIn June 1917, Lieutenant-Colonel H. Parker was detailed to inquire into\r\nthe military value of tanks, and in the following month he forwarded\r\nhis report on this subject to the Operation Section of the Infantry\r\nCommittee of Colonel C. B. Baker’s Commission.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Parker’s report makes good reading; not only is\r\nit virile but sound. It was indeed a great pity that it was not more\r\ncompletely acted on. The following is an extract from it:\r\n\r\n  “1. A hole 30 k. wide _punched_ through _the whole German\r\n  formation_ deep enough to uncover a line of communication to a\r\n  flank attack.\r\n\r\n  “This hole must be wide enough to assure the passage of lighter\r\n  equipment--the divisional machine-gun companies can follow the\r\n  tanks because the tanks will _make_ a road for them.\r\n\r\n  “The wave of machine guns--divisional companies--must turn out to\r\n  right and left, supported by a second line of tanks, to widen the\r\n  breach.\r\n\r\n  “The wave of machine guns must be followed by _cavalry_--‘hell for\r\n  leather’--if the hole is once punched through, and this cavalry\r\n  must strike lines of communication _at all hazards_. Possibly\r\n  motor-cycle machine guns may be better adapted to this use than\r\n  cavalry, but _I am a believer in the cavalry_. Support it with\r\n  Jitney-carried infantry and machine guns as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n  “2. The problem is _that of passing a defile_. _Nothing more._\r\n  It is like trying to force a mountain pass, where the sides are\r\n  occupied by enemy who can fire down into the pass. The ‘pass’ is\r\n  some 30 k. in length, and we must have something that can _drive\r\n  through_. Then turn to the sides and widen the breach. Assail 100\r\n  k. to cover assault.\r\n\r\n  “It is the old ‘flying wedge’ of football, with interference coming\r\n  through the hole in the line. The ‘tanks’ take the place of the\r\n  ‘line buckers’ who open the hole; the ‘Divisional Jitney machine\r\n  guns’ are the ‘interference,’ the ‘cavalry’ will carry the ball as\r\n  soon as the hole is opened, _i.e._ ride through and hit the line of\r\n  communication.\r\n\r\n  “3. The operation works out this way:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) A cloud of fighting avions at high altitude, to clear the air.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) A cloud of observation avions at low altitude, just in front\r\n          of the line of tanks, dropping bombs and using machine guns\r\n          on the trenches.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Our long-range artillery blocking the German artillery.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) Our lighter artillery barraging the front to prevent escape\r\n          of the Germans in their front lines.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) Our mobile machine guns following up the tanks at about 500\r\n          yards, covering them with _canopy fire_, step by step.\r\n\r\n  (_f_) Our Divisional Jitney companies of machine guns driving in\r\n          ‘hell-bent’ after the tanks and widening the breach.\r\n\r\n  (_g_) Our cavalry riding through this breach as soon as it is\r\n          opened for them and swinging out _à la_ Jeb. Stuart around\r\n          McClellan’s Army. Sacrificed? of course, but winning results\r\n          worth the sacrifice.\r\n\r\n  (_h_) Jitney or truck-transported infantry following as fast as\r\n          gasoline can carry it to support the success and make our\r\n          foothold sure.\r\n\r\n  (_i_) Truck-transported--or tank-transported--artillery following\r\n          as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n“I BELIEVE SUCH A PLAN WILL WIN. FRITZ HAS NOT THE RESOURCES TO\r\nADOPT SUCH A PLAN. WE HAVE. WE SHOULD DO IT AND DO IT NOW as far as\r\npreparation goes in material. It will take time to get ready.”\r\n\r\nShortly before this report was written, Colonel Rockenbach, the\r\ncommander designate of the American Tank Corps, landed in France\r\nand proceeded with General Pershing to Chaumont, the U.S.A. General\r\nHeadquarters.\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1917, a project for a Tank Corps was approved. The\r\nCorps was to consist of 5 heavy and 20 light battalions, together with\r\nheadquarter units, depots and workshops, while in the United States a\r\ntraining centre comprising 2 heavy and 5 light battalions was to be\r\nmaintained. In May 1918 the establishment of the Corps was expanded to\r\n15 brigades, each brigade to consist of 1 heavy and 2 light battalions,\r\nthe former to be armed with the Mark VIII and the latter with the\r\nRenault tank.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an immense constructional programme was developed for both\r\nMark VIII.s and Renaults, yet, in spite of this, by November 11, 1918,\r\none year and seven months after America entered the war, only some\r\ntwenty odd American-built Renault tanks had been landed in France.\r\nThe slowness in American construction is very apparent when it is\r\nremembered that a similar period only elapsed between the first sketch\r\ndrawing of the British Mark I tank, in February 1915, and the landing\r\nof this machine in France in August 1916.\r\n\r\nThe lack of machines in the American Tank Corps rendered the training\r\nof its personnel impossible, consequently at the beginning of 1918\r\ntwo training camps were started, one at Bovington--the British Tank\r\nTraining Centre--and the other at Bourg in the Haute-Marne, where\r\ntraining was carried out under French supervision. The history of the\r\nunits trained at these two centres will be dealt with separately as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nBy February 1918, 500 volunteers from various branches of the American\r\nArmy were assembled at Bourg for instruction. On March 27, 10 Renault\r\nmachines were taken over from the French, another 15 being sent to\r\nBourg in June. In August, 144 Renault tanks arrived, and 2 light\r\nbattalions were at once mobilised under the command of Colonel G. S.\r\nPatten and were railed to the St. Mihiel area, where they operated with\r\nthe First American Army, which attacked the famous salient on September\r\n12.\r\n\r\nFrom a tank point of view this attack was a disappointing one. From\r\nrailhead both battalions moved 20 kilometres to their positions of\r\nassembly, but on the first day of the attack, owing to the difficulties\r\nof ground in a well-established defence area, they never succeeded in\r\ncatching up with the infantry. These troops moved forward rapidly, for\r\nit must be remembered that the enemy’s resistance was very feeble,\r\nthe salient having already been partially evacuated by the enemy.\r\nOwing to lack of petrol the tanks did not participate in the second\r\nday’s fighting, and on the third they appear only on one occasion to\r\nhave come into contact with the enemy and to have collected a number\r\nof prisoners. The following day these two battalions were withdrawn\r\npractically intact, only three machines being left behind damaged or\r\nbroken down.\r\n\r\nThe American tanks next appear fighting side by side with French\r\ntank units in the Argonne operations. Profiting by their previous\r\nexperience, although infantry and tanks had never met on the training\r\nground, the two American tank battalions materially assisted their\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the Argonne attack, September 26, it had been\r\nintended to keep a reserve of tanks in hand for the second day’s\r\noperations, but owing to the infantry being held up these went into the\r\nattack about noon.\r\n\r\nFrom this date until October 13 these battalions were continually\r\nplaced at the disposal of the infantry commanders, but were not often\r\ncalled upon to take an active part in operations. Frequently they were\r\nmoved many miles, to the detriment of their tracks and engines and\r\nwithout achieving any great result; they were also used independently\r\nfor reconnaissance work and for unsupported attacks delivered against\r\npositions the infantry had failed to capture.\r\n\r\nOn October 13 the remains of these two battalions were withdrawn and\r\na provisional company was formed which accompanied the advance of the\r\nAmerican forces until the cessation of hostilities on November 11, 1918.\r\n\r\nThe 301st U.S.A. Heavy Tank Battalion arrived at Wool on April 10, and\r\ncontinued training under British instruction until August 24, when\r\nit embarked for France. Soon after its arrival in this country it was\r\nattached to the 1st British Tank Brigade.\r\n\r\nOn September 29 the 301st American Tank Battalion took part in the\r\nimportant attack carried out by the 27th and 30th American Divisions\r\nagainst the Hindenburg Line running east of the Bellicourt tunnel.\r\nThe attack started at 5.50 a.m. in a thick mist, and though the 30th\r\nAmerican Division reached the Bellicourt tunnel to time, the 27th on\r\nits left was held up. On the front of the last-named Division only one\r\ntank succeeded in crossing the tunnel, the others running foul of an\r\nold British minefield as described in Chapter XXXV. Of the thirty-four\r\ntanks which took part in this attack only ten rallied.\r\n\r\nOn October 8, when the Fourth Army resumed the offensive, the 301st\r\nBattalion was allotted to the IInd American Corps, which was attacking\r\na position some 3,000 yards north-west of Brancourt with the IXth\r\nBritish Corps on its right and the XIIIth on its left. This attack was\r\na complete success; the 301st Battalion fought right through to its\r\nfinal objective, rendering the greatest assistance to the infantry, who\r\nworked in close co-operation with the tanks. One tank in particular did\r\ngreat execution: it advanced, firing both its 6-pounders at the railway\r\ncutting between Beaurevoir and Montbrehain, the ground being littered\r\nwith German dead.\r\n\r\nNine days later, on the 17th, the attack was continued, the 301st\r\nBattalion again being attached to the IInd American Corps, the\r\nobjective of which was a line running west of Busigny--eastern edge\r\nof La Sablière wood (south of Busigny)--west of Bohain. In this\r\noperation the crossing of the river Selle, south of St. Souplet, was\r\na most difficult problem, as the river ran through “No Man’s Land”;\r\nnevertheless, by means of low-flying aeroplanes reconnaissance and\r\nnight-patrol work was carried out, crossings were selected, and on the\r\nactual day of the attack no fewer than nineteen tanks out of the twenty\r\noperating successfully crossed the stream.\r\n\r\nThe next and last attack carried out by the 301st Battalion during the\r\nwar took place on October 23, when nine tanks of this unit assisted\r\nthe 6th and 1st British Divisions in an attack in the neighbourhood of\r\nBazuel, south-east of Le Cateau. This operation was part of the Fourth\r\nArmy’s attack, the objectives of which were the high ground overlooking\r\nthe canal de la Sambre et Oise, between Catillon, and Bois l’Evêque and\r\nthe villages of Fontaine-au-Bois, Robersart, and Bousies.\r\n\r\nAll nine tanks moved forward at zero hour behind the barrage, and\r\nfrom the report of an observer who saw these machines in action it\r\nappears that they cleared up the whole of the ground as far as the\r\nBazuel-Catillon road. Very little opposition was met with, but in\r\nspite of this, owing to the poor visibility and the enclosed nature of\r\nthe country, the infantry were slow in following the tanks and great\r\ndifficulty was experienced in maintaining touch with them. Nevertheless\r\nall infantry commanders expressed themselves well pleased with the work\r\nthe tanks had accomplished, which had chiefly consisted in reducing\r\nstrong points and breaking paths through the hedges. Of the nine tanks\r\nwhich took the field all rallied; no casualties other than five men,\r\nslightly gassed, were suffered. The attack on this day was altogether a\r\nfitting conclusion to the brief but conspicuously gallant career of the\r\n301st American Tank Battalion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLES OF THE SELLE AND MAUBEUGE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 12, the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, and 15th Battalions were\r\nwithdrawn and placed in G.H.Q. reserve, and on the following day the\r\n6th Battalion was transferred to the 4th Tank Brigade; meanwhile the\r\nretiring enemy endeavoured to form a defensive line on the east side of\r\nthe river Selle.\r\n\r\nOn this front, on October 17, the Fourth Army and the First French Army\r\nattacked from Le Cateau southwards to Vaux Andigny on a front of about\r\ntwelve miles. The 4th Tank Brigade was the only brigade in action, and\r\nits battalions were allotted as follows:\r\n\r\n  1st Tank Battalion          To the IXth Corps, on the right.\r\n  301st American Battalion    To the IInd American Corps, in the centre.\r\n  16th Tank Battalion         To the XIIIth Corps, on the left.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Tank Battalion was held in Fourth Army reserve.\r\n\r\nThe chief obstacle was the river Selle, the course of which roughly\r\napproximated to the starting line in “No Man’s Land,” consequently\r\nreconnaissance of this obstacle was extremely difficult. In spite of\r\nthis tapes were laid across the stream at night time, when it was\r\ndiscovered that the river had been dammed in places in order to render\r\nthe crossing of tanks over it more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe early morning of the 17th was so foggy that tanks had to move\r\nforward at zero hour (5.30 a.m.) on compass bearings. Each of the\r\nforty-eight machines used carried a crib, and by casting these into the\r\nSelle north of St. Souplet and at Molain the 1st and 16th Battalions\r\nand the 301st American Battalion crossed this river safely. The\r\nresistance offered by the enemy was not great, the Germans apparently\r\nhaving considered the flooded river a certain obstacle against tanks.\r\n\r\nThree days later the Third Army attacked between Le Cateau and the\r\nScheldt canal, four tanks of the 11th Battalion co-operating with the\r\nVth Corps against Neuvilly and Amervalles. Again the chief difficulty\r\nwas the crossing of the Selle: this was successfully effected by means\r\nof an underwater sleeper bridge constructed by the Royal Engineers at\r\nnight time: being under water the bridge was not visible to the enemy\r\nduring the day. The attack was entirely successful, all four tanks\r\ncrossing the river and reaching their objectives.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of October the 2nd Tank Brigade was reconstituted,\r\nthe following battalions being allotted to it: 6th, 9th, 10th, 14th\r\nBattalions, and the 301st American Tank Battalion. All these units were\r\nshort of men and very short of machines.\r\n\r\nOn October 23, thirty-seven tanks took part in a successful moonlight\r\nattack at 1.20 a.m. carried out by the Third and Fourth Armies north\r\nand south of Le Cateau, with the object of securing the whole line from\r\nthe Sambre along the edge of the forest of Mormal to the vicinity of\r\nValenciennes. In this attack the following battalions took part:\r\n\r\n  301st American Tank Battalion, allotted to IXth Corps.\r\n  10th Tank Battalion, allotted to XIIIth Corps.\r\n  11th and 12th Tank Battalions, allotted to Vth Corps.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the darkness, mist, and a considerable amount of gas\r\nshelling, all objectives were reached. Many good targets presented\r\nthemselves, especially for case-shot fire, and in all some 3,000\r\nprisoners were captured. In this attack tanks were of considerable help\r\nin crushing down hedges and so opening gaps in them for the infantry to\r\npass through.\r\n\r\nThe attack was continued on the following day, six machines of the\r\n10th Battalion co-operating with the 18th and 25th Divisions in the\r\nneighbourhood of Robersart. Near Renuart farm great assistance was\r\nrendered to the infantry, and a German ammunition dump exploded by a\r\n6-pounder shell threw the enemy into great confusion and inflicted many\r\ncasualties on him.\r\n\r\nWith this attack the battle of the Selle came to an end and with it 475\r\nguns and 20,000 prisoners were added to those already captured.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Maubeuge opened on November 2 with an attack carried out\r\nby the IXth Corps west of Landrecies. This attack was supported by\r\nthree tanks of the 10th Battalion and it was carried out in order to\r\nimprove our position near Happegarbes preliminary to a big attack on\r\nthe 4th. All objectives were taken, but unfortunately lost again before\r\nnightfall.\r\n\r\nNovember 4 witnessed the last large tank attack of the war, large only\r\nin comparison with the number of machines at this time fit for action.\r\nThe attack was on a broad front of over thirty miles, extending from\r\nthe river Oise to north of Valenciennes. On the British section of this\r\nfront thirty-seven tanks were used and were allotted as follows:\r\n\r\n  Third Army      VIth Corps      1 Company 6th Tank Battalion.\r\n                  IVth Corps      2 Sections 14th Tank Battalion.\r\n                  Vth Corps       1 Company 9th Tank Battalion.\r\n\r\n  Fourth Army     XIIIth Corps    5 Sections 14th Tank Battalion.\r\n                                  2 Companies 9th Tank Battalion.\r\n                                  2 Sections 14th Tank Battalion.\r\n                                  17th Armoured Car Battalion.\r\n                  IXth Corps      4 Sections 10th Tank Battalion.\r\n\r\nFrom the above distribution of tanks it will be seen how exhausted\r\nunits had become, sections now taking the place of companies and\r\ncompanies of battalions.\r\n\r\nZero hour varied on the Corps fronts from 5.30 to 6.15 a.m. Briefly the\r\naction of the tanks was as follows:\r\n\r\nThose of the 10th Tank Battalion assisted in the taking of Catillon and\r\nHappeharbes; the capture of the former village was an important step\r\nin securing the crossing over the Oise canal. Generally speaking the\r\ntanks operating with the XIIIth Corps had a successful day, especially\r\nin the neighbourhood of Hecq, Preux, and the north-western edge of the\r\nforest of Mormal. Although supply tanks[37] are not meant for fighting\r\npurposes, three, which were carrying forward bridging material for the\r\n25th Division, came into action near Landrecies. On approaching the\r\ncanal they found that our infantry were still on its western side,\r\nhung up by machine-gun fire. One tank being knocked out, the section\r\ncommander decided to push on with the other two; this he did, our\r\ninfantry following these machines as if they were fighting tanks, with\r\nthe result that the machine-gunners surrendered and the far bank of the\r\ncanal was secured.\r\n\r\nThe following day, November 5, saw the last tank action of the war,\r\neight Whippets of the 6th Tank Battalion taking part in an attack of\r\nthe 3rd Guards Brigade north of the forest of Mormal. The country was\r\nmost difficult for combined operations, for it was intersected by\r\nnumerous ditches and fences which rendered it ideal for the rearguard\r\noperations the Germans were now fighting all along their front. Either\r\nthe Whippets had to go forward and so lose touch with our infantry or\r\nremain with the infantry and lose touch with the enemy. In spite of\r\nthese difficulties all objectives were taken, and the last tank action\r\nof the war was a success.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days refitting continued with a view to building\r\nup an organised fighting force from the shattered remnants of the Tank\r\nCorps; as this was in progress the signing of the armistice terms on\r\nNovember 11 brought hostilities to an end.\r\n\r\nNinety-six days of almost continuous battle had now taken place since\r\nthe great tank attack at Amiens was launched by the Fourth Army on\r\nAugust 8, since when many of the officers and men of the Tank Corps had\r\nbeen in action as many as fifteen and sixteen times. During this period\r\nno fewer than 1,993 tanks and tank armoured cars had been engaged on\r\nthirty-nine days in all; 887 machines had been handed over to Salvage,\r\n313 of these being sent to the Central Workshops, and 204 having been\r\nrepaired and reissued to battalions. Of the above 887 tanks, only\r\nfifteen had been struck off the strength as unsalvable. Casualties\r\nagainst establishment had been heavy: 598 officers and 2,826 other\r\nranks being counted amongst killed, wounded, missing, and prisoners;\r\nbut when it is considered that the total strength of the Tank Corps on\r\nAugust 7 was considerably under that of an infantry division, and that\r\nin the old days of the artillery battles, such as the First Battle of\r\nthe Somme, an infantry division frequently sustained 4,000 casualties\r\nin twelve hours fighting, the tank casualties were extraordinarily\r\nlight. It was no longer a matter of twelve hours’ but of thirty-nine\r\ndays’ fighting at twelve hours a day. From this we may deduce our\r\nfinal and outstanding lesson from all these battles, namely, that iron\r\nmechanically moved is an economiser of blood, that the tank is an\r\neconomiser of life--the lives of men, men being the most valuable asset\r\nany country can possess.\r\n\r\nThe determination of Sir Douglas Haig had at length been rewarded, and\r\nthe endeavours which failed at Passchendaele won through finally and\r\nirrevocably at Maubeuge. A fitting conclusion to all these operations\r\nis to be found in the last dispatch of the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nBritish Armies, which hands down to posterity a just judgment on the\r\nvalue of the work carried out by the British Tank Corps during the\r\never-memorable months of August to November 1918. In these dispatches\r\nare to be found the following three paragraphs, which are worth\r\npondering over when the time comes for us to consider the future:\r\n\r\n  “In the decisive contests of this period, the strongest and most\r\n  vital parts of the enemy’s front were attacked by the British,\r\n  his lateral communications were cut and his best divisions fought\r\n  to a standstill. On the different battle fronts 187,000 prisoners\r\n  and 2,850 guns were captured by us, bringing the total of our\r\n  prisoners for the present year to over 201,000. Immense numbers of\r\n  machine guns and trench mortars were taken also, the figures of\r\n  those actually counted exceeding 29,000 machine guns and some 3,000\r\n  trench mortars. These results were achieved by 59 fighting British\r\n  divisions, which in the course of three months of battle engaged\r\n  and defeated 99 separate divisions.”\r\n\r\n  “Since the opening of our offensive on August 8, tanks have\r\n  been employed on every battlefield, and the importance of the\r\n  part played by them in breaking up the resistance of the German\r\n  infantry can scarcely be exaggerated. The whole scheme of the\r\n  attack of August 8 was dependent upon tanks, and ever since that\r\n  date on numberless occasions the success of our infantry has been\r\n  powerfully assisted or confirmed by their timely arrival. So great\r\n  has been the effect produced upon the German infantry by the\r\n  appearance of British tanks that in more than one instance, when\r\n  for various reasons real tanks were not available in sufficient\r\n  numbers, valuable results have been obtained by the use of dummy\r\n  tanks painted on frames of wood and canvas.\r\n\r\n  “It is no disparagement of the courage of our infantry, or of the\r\n  skill and devotion of our artillery, to say that the achievements\r\n  of those essential arms would have fallen short of the full measure\r\n  of success achieved by our armies had it not been for the very\r\n  gallant and devoted work of the Tank Corps, under the command of\r\n  Major-General H. J. Elles.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE 17TH TANK ARMOURED CAR BATTALION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March 1918 the 17th Tank Battalion was in process of formation at\r\nthe Tank Training Centre at Wool, when the German spring offensive\r\nresulted in so great a demand being made on the home resources that\r\nit was converted into an Armoured Car Battalion on April 23. On the\r\nfollowing day the drivers were selected, and sixteen armoured cars,\r\nwhich were earmarked for the eastern theatre of war, were handed over\r\nto it, the Vickers machine guns being replaced by Hotchkiss ones.\r\n\r\nOn April 28 the cars were embarked at Portsmouth, and on the 29th the\r\npersonnel, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel E. J. Carter, left\r\nFolkestone for Boulogne. Thus in six days the whole battalion was\r\nformed, equipped, and landed in France.\r\n\r\nImmediately on landing the 17th Battalion was attached to the Second\r\nArmy and ordered to proceed to Poperinghe, but the tactical situation\r\nimproving these orders were cancelled and it was first sent to the Tank\r\nGunnery School at Merlimont for instruction, and later on to the Tank\r\nDepot at Mers.\r\n\r\nAfter some ten days’ training the 17th Battalion joined the Fourth Army\r\nand went into the line at La Hussoye, being attached to the Australian\r\nCorps. A few days later the battalion was transferred to the XXIInd\r\nCorps, which was then resting in G.H.Q. reserve, immediately behind\r\nthe right flank of the British Army, and battalion headquarters were\r\nestablished at Pissy. Here training continued until June 10, when at\r\n9.30 a.m. instructions were received by Lieutenant-Colonel Carter to\r\nreport to the headquarters of the First French Army at Conty.\r\n\r\nAt Conty orders were issued for the battalion to proceed to Ravenel\r\nnear St. Just. The battalion was notified of this by telephone, and,\r\nalthough the night was very dark and wet and the roads crowded with\r\ntraffic, it reached Ravenel by 5 a.m. on June 11, after a sixty-mile\r\njourney, and went into action with the Tenth French Army in its\r\ncounter-attack at Belloy on that day. In this battle two sections of\r\narmoured cars engaged the enemy with machine-gun fire, but the quantity\r\nof debris scattered on the roads, and the fragile nature of the chassis\r\nof the cars, prevented their being freely used. On the conclusion of\r\nthese operations the battalion returned to the XXIInd Corps.\r\n\r\nOn July 18 the 17th Battalion was ordered to join General Fayolle’s\r\nArmy, but did not come into action on account of delays on the road\r\ndue to congested traffic. Ten days later it was attached to the 6th\r\nFrench Cavalry Division, which was operating north of Château-Thierry\r\nfollowing the retreating enemy towards the river Ourcq. On this river\r\nthe Germans took up a defensive position, covering its approaches\r\nby machine-gun fire; this brought the French cavalry to a halt, but\r\nnot the armoured cars, which were able, on account of their armour,\r\nto approach quite close to the bridges and open fire on the enemy’s\r\nmachine-gunners. At Fère-en-Tardenois the battalion greatly aided the\r\nFrench by moving through the main streets of the village, which was\r\nheld by Germans. Similar assistance was rendered to the Americans at\r\nRonchères.\r\n\r\nWhen the 6th French Cavalry Division was withdrawn to rest the 17th\r\nBattalion proceeded to Senlis, and at 9 a.m., having just entered this\r\ntown, it received orders to proceed forthwith to Amiens, and report to\r\nthe headquarters of the Australian Corps. Amiens, which was nearly 100\r\nmiles distant, was reached the same night.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Amiens Lieutenant-Colonel Carter was informed that\r\nhis unit was to take part in the projected attack east of this town.\r\nThe chief difficulty foreseen in an armoured-car action in this\r\nneighbourhood was the crossing of the trenches. Although only one day\r\nwas available wherein to find a solution to this difficulty, it was\r\naccomplished by attaching a small force of tanks to the battalion.\r\nThese tanks were used to tow the armoured cars over the obstacles, or\r\nrather, along the tracks the tanks formed through them. This solution\r\nproved eminently successful.\r\n\r\nFor the Fourth Army operations the 17th Armoured Car Battalion was\r\nplaced under the orders of the 5th Tank Brigade. On the morning of\r\nAugust 8 the battalion moved forward with its accompanying tanks,\r\nwhich successfully assisted all its cars over “No Man’s Land.” Beyond\r\nWarfusée, several large trees, felled by shell fire, had fallen across\r\nthe road, entirely blocking it; these were speedily removed by the\r\ntowing tanks, thus clearing the road not only for the armoured cars but\r\nfor our guns and transport. After this delay the cars moved rapidly\r\nforward and passed through our attacking lines about twenty minutes\r\nbefore the infantry were timed to reach their final objective. To\r\naccomplish this the cars had to run through our own artillery barrage;\r\nthis they did without casualty.\r\n\r\nThe road was now clear and the cars proceeded through the enemy’s\r\nlines, scattering any infantry they found on the road. They made for\r\nthe valley near Foucaucourt, where the headquarter troops of a German\r\nCorps were known to be encamped. These troops were completely surprised\r\nand many casualties were inflicted on them by six cars moving through\r\nthe valley. The confusion caused soon developed into a panic, the enemy\r\nscattering in all directions, spreading the alarm.\r\n\r\nWhilst this surprise was developing, several sections of armoured\r\ncars turned south and north off the Amiens-Brie road. The former met\r\nlarge columns of transport and mounted officers and teams of horses\r\napparently belonging to the German headquarters at Framerville. These\r\nwere fired on at short range, four officers being shot down by a single\r\nburst of fire. Shortly after this the German headquarters were reached,\r\nand the Australian Corps flag, which had been carried in one of the\r\ncars for the purpose, was run up over the house which, until a few\r\nminutes before, had been occupied by the German Corps Commander. At\r\nabout this time one car came in sight of a German train: the engine was\r\nfired at and put out of action; later on the cavalry arriving captured\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe cars which had turned northwards entered Proyart and Chuignolles,\r\ntwo moving up to the river Somme. At Proyart the cars found the German\r\ntroops at dinner; these they shot down and scattered in all directions,\r\nand then, moving westwards, met masses of the enemy driven from their\r\ntrenches by the Australians. In order to surprise these men, who were\r\nmoving eastwards, the cars hid in the outskirts of Proyart, and, when\r\nthe enemy was between fifty and one hundred yards distant, they rapidly\r\nmoved forward, shooting down great numbers. Scattering from before the\r\ncars at Proyart the enemy made across country towards Chuignolles,\r\nonly to be met by the cars which had proceeded to this village, and\r\nwere once again fired on and dispersed. Near Chuignolles one armoured\r\ncar obtained “running practice” with its machine guns at a lorry full\r\nof troops, and kept up fire until the lorry ran into the ditch. There\r\nwere also several cases of armoured cars following German transport\r\nvehicles, without anything unusual being suspected, until fire was\r\nopened at point-blank range.\r\n\r\nAlthough more than half the cars were out of action by the evening of\r\nthe 8th there were no casualties amongst their personnel sufficiently\r\nserious to require evacuation.\r\n\r\nAfter repairing the damages sustained on August 8, the 17th Battalion\r\nwas transferred to the First Army, and on August 21 took part in\r\nthe operations near Bucquoy. At the entrance of the village a large\r\ncrater had been blown in the road, over which the cars were hauled\r\nafter a smooth path had been beaten down across it by a Whippet tank.\r\nThe cars then made their way through the enemy’s lines and reached\r\nAchiet-le-Petit ahead of our infantry, where several machine guns were\r\nsilenced by them. In this action two of the cars received direct hits,\r\none of them being burnt out and destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn August 24 the battalion operated with the New Zealand Division in\r\nthe attack on Bapaume, the cars penetrating to the Arras-Bapaume road,\r\nwhere severe fighting took place.\r\n\r\nIn the attack of September 2, the 17th Battalion operated with\r\nthe Canadian Corps in the assault on the Drocourt-Queant line. In\r\nthis action four cars were hit by shell fire, but two squadrons of\r\naeroplanes co-operating with the cars attacked the German battery so\r\nvigorously that the crews of the disabled cars were able to escape\r\nbeing captured.\r\n\r\nOn September 29 the armoured cars operated with the Australian Corps\r\nand the IInd American Corps in the attack on the Hindenburg Line near\r\nBony; here numerous casualties were inflicted on the enemy and four\r\ncars were put out of action by being burnt. This position was captured\r\nby the Australians on the following day.\r\n\r\nOn October 8 the armoured cars were attached to the Cavalry Corps,\r\nwhich was operating from Beaurevoir towards Le Cateau. On this day the\r\ncars kept touch with the cavalry, but on the following morning they\r\nmoved forward through Maretz. About two miles beyond this village a\r\nsection co-operated with South African infantry and drove the German\r\nmachine-gunners from a strong position they were holding. The cars\r\nwere able to run right through the hostile machine-gun fire, and by\r\nenfilading the enemy’s position killed the German machine-gunners and\r\ncaptured ten machine guns and two trench mortars.\r\n\r\nA section of cars made a dash to cross the railway bridge on the\r\nMaretz-Honnechy road, but the enemy’s demolition party saw them coming\r\nand, lighting the fuse, fled. The leading car, however, got across\r\nsafely, the charge exploding and blowing up the bridge immediately this\r\ncar had crossed and thereby cutting it off from the second car, which\r\nwas some fifty yards behind. The leading car then went through Maurois\r\nand Honnechy, all guns firing; both of these villages were crowded with\r\ntroops. Near Honnechy church the car ran into a by-road by mistake;\r\nat the same moment a group of Germans came out of a house and the car\r\naccounted for five of them in the doorway. This incident was described\r\nwith enthusiasm by a French woman, the owner of the house, to\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Carter on the following day. After passing Honnechy\r\nthe car was run towards a bridge which was known to exist. Profiting by\r\nhis previous experience the commander of the car determined to save the\r\nbridge from demolition and so not only effect his retreat but secure\r\nit to the British Army. To accomplish this the car rapidly moved round\r\na corner of the road leading to the bridge, with its guns pointing in\r\nthe direction where the demolition party would probably be. This action\r\nproved successful, the demolition party being scattered by a burst of\r\nbullets before the charge could be fired. The bridge was thus saved\r\nand proved of great importance to the British forces later on. The car\r\nthen crossed the river and proceeded to the spot where the second car\r\nhad been unable to cross, picking it up; both cars returned to report\r\ntheir action, one at least having accomplished a very daring and useful\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nOn November 4 the armoured cars were attached to the XVIIIth Corps and\r\nwere detailed to operate with the 18th and 50th Divisions in the forest\r\nof Mormal. In this district the roads are narrow and at this time of\r\nthe year were very slippery; armoured-car action was therefore most\r\ndifficult. On the next day the cars of the 17th Battalion, now much\r\nreduced in numbers, were operating with no fewer than five divisions\r\nsimultaneously. On the 9th all cars were concentrated and attached to\r\nthe Fourth Army advanced guard to assist in the pursuit of the retiring\r\nenemy. In the action which followed the cars were cut off from the\r\nadvanced guard by all the river bridges being destroyed, but in spite\r\nof this they were able to continue advancing on a line parallel to the\r\npursuit. At Ramousies and Liessies three complete trains of ammunition\r\nwere passed and numbers of heavy guns, lorries and artillery transport,\r\nthe enemy being in full flight and in a high state of demoralisation.\r\n\r\nOn November 11 the armoured cars were reconnoitring towards\r\nEppé-Sauvage and Moustier (twelve miles east of Avegnes), near the\r\nBelgian frontier, some seven or eight miles in advance of the nearest\r\nBritish troops, when at 10.30 a.m. an officer from the 33rd French\r\nDivision informed the officer in command that he had heard rumours of\r\nan armistice; a few minutes later a dispatch-rider corroborated this\r\ninformation, stating that hostilities were to cease at 11 a.m. Firing\r\nwent on until about three minutes to eleven, when it ceased, breaking\r\nout in a final crash at eleven o’clock--then all was silence; a silence\r\nalmost uncanny to the men of the 17th Tank Armoured Car Battalion, who\r\nhad not been out of gunshot since July 17, the date upon which the\r\nbattalion opened its eventful history with the French Army on the Marne.\r\n\r\nDramatic as had been the short and brilliant career of the 17th\r\nArmoured Car Battalion, its work was not yet ended. On November 13 it\r\nassembled at Avesnes, and joining the cavalry of the Fourth Army moved\r\nforward towards the Rhine. On the 26th four sections of cars were\r\nordered to Charleroi to deal with a reported disturbance. In this town\r\nthey were received with the greatest enthusiasm by the inhabitants,\r\nand at Courcelles were surrounded by excited townsfolk who, having\r\ncollected all available brass instruments, crowded round the cars\r\nplaying the British National Anthem at a range of about five yards.\r\n\r\nFrom Charleroi, the 17th Battalion joined the Second Army, moving on\r\nCologne, and were attached to the 1st Cavalry Division. On December\r\n1 the German frontier was crossed at Malmédy, whence the battalion\r\nwas immediately sent on with the 2nd Cavalry Brigade to deal with\r\ndisturbances which had broken out in Cologne. Five days later, on the\r\n6th, the cavalry halted outside the town, and the G.O.C. 2nd Cavalry\r\nBrigade, escorted by cars of the 17th Battalion, proceeded to the\r\nRathaus to discuss the administration of the town with the burgomaster.\r\nCologne was entered at midday, the crews of the armoured cars being the\r\nfirst British troops to enter. That afternoon the western end of the\r\nRhine bridge was occupied, and the colours of the Tank Corps run up to\r\nflutter over the famous river.\r\n\r\nThe record of this battalion is a truly remarkable one. It was formed,\r\nequipped, and landed in France in the short space of six days. In six\r\nmonths it fought in ten separate battles with English, Australian,\r\nCanadian, New Zealand, South African, French, and American troops, and\r\nwas three times mentioned in German dispatches. Every car was hit and\r\nsome of them many times, and yet the total losses in killed in action\r\nthroughout this period was only one officer and four other ranks. At\r\nthe cost of these five men and seven cars totally destroyed, this\r\nbattalion must have inflicted scores if not hundreds of casualties on\r\nthe enemy. That the British Army was not equipped with many more of\r\nthese units will be a problem which will doubtless perplex the minds of\r\nfuture military historians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nA RETROSPECT OF WHAT TANKS HAVE ACCOMPLISHED\r\n\r\n\r\nLike all other human energies, war may be reduced to a science, and had\r\nthis, throughout history, been better understood, how many countless\r\nthousands of lives and millions of money might not have been saved, and\r\nhow much sorrow and waste might not have been prevented!\r\n\r\nScience is but another name for knowledge--knowledge co-ordinated,\r\narranged and systematised--from which art, or the application of\r\nknowledge to existing and ever-changing conditions, is derived and\r\nbuilt up on unchanging principles.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental difficulty in the art of war is in the application\r\nof its theories in order to test their values. Like surgery and\r\nmedicine, it demands its patients or victims as its training-ground,\r\nand without these it is most difficult to arrive at expert judgments\r\nand conclusions. It is an art which is neither directly commercial,\r\nmaterially remunerative, nor normally applicable, consequently it has\r\ngenerally been looked upon as a necessary evil, an insurance against\r\ndisaster rather than the application of a science which should have as\r\nits main object the prevention of the calamity of war.\r\n\r\nAs an applied science, war is half human, half mechanical; it is,\r\ntherefore, pre-eminently a live or dynamic science, a science which\r\nmust grow with human understanding itself, so that its means of action,\r\nmaterialised in the soldier, may not only keep level with progress but\r\nabsorb it to its own particular ends. When we look back on the history\r\nof war, what do we see? A school of pedants fumbling with the past,\r\nhoodwinked against the future, seeking panaceas in past victories,\r\nthe circumstances under which these were won being blindly accepted\r\nas recurring decimals. Thus do they lumber their minds with obsolete\r\ndetail, formulæ and shibboleths, precepts and rituals which are as\r\nmuch out of place on the modern battlefield as phlogiston or the\r\nphilosopher’s stone would be in a present-day laboratory.\r\n\r\nTime and again has it been asserted that war itself is the sole test of\r\na soldier’s worth and that on the battlefield alone will the great be\r\nsifted from the little.\r\n\r\nAnd why? Because, until to-day, we have never emerged from what may be\r\ncalled the “alchemical” epoch of warfare, the compounding of illusions\r\nwithout knowledge, the application of actions without understanding;\r\nwe have not reduced war to a science founded on definite principles\r\nnor learnt that 99 per cent. of victory depends on weapons, machinery\r\nplaced in the hands of man so that he may kill without being injured.\r\n\r\nGalen was a great physician and so was Paracelsus, but who to-day would\r\napply their methods when they can employ those of Pasteur and Lister?\r\nWhere we have been so wrong and will continue to remain so wrong,\r\nunless we radically change our peace methods of warfare, is that we\r\npossess no process of producing great peace soldiers--scientists for\r\nwar. We do not realise that an army is formed to prevent war, that it\r\nis composed of human points, that the good player will not lose many\r\nof these points, and that the bad player will go bankrupt. That the\r\nloss or gain depends on superiority of brains and of weapons and not\r\nnecessarily superiority of rank and numbers of men. When we do realise\r\nthis, then shall we cast the ancient balsams, solvents, and coagulants\r\nto the winds and set about developing the mental and mechanical sides\r\nof war in days of peace, so that, should wars become inevitable, we may\r\nwin them with the minimum of human loss.\r\n\r\nSoldiers have laughed at Joly de Maizeroy, Massenbach, and Maurice\r\nde Saxe for suggesting “victory without fighting,” “wars without\r\nbattles”; but seldom are their eyes dimmed with a tear when they read\r\nof a victory which cost thousands of lives, and a victory which might\r\nhave been won at the cost of a few hundreds. Yet surely is the saving\r\nof men’s lives and limbs as great an attribute of good leadership as\r\nthe taking of those of the enemy; is it not in fact endurance, or the\r\nstaying power in human lives, which is the backbone of victory itself?\r\n\r\nIn August 1914 the Great War opened to all intents and purposes as\r\nan exaggerated 1870 operation. The doctrine of the contending armies\r\nwas 1870, its leaders were saturated with 1870 ideas, its weapons\r\nwere improved 1870, it was 1870 in complexion, in tone, in manner,\r\nin thought, in tactics, and in movement. If this be doubted read the\r\ntext-books prior to the war and compare them with those of 1872 and\r\nthen with the events of the war itself. Take any great army of 1918 and\r\nplace it over the same army of 1914: the sides do not coincide. What is\r\nthe one great difference? Mechanical progress in weapons, not numbers\r\nof men, for men potentially had in numbers decreased; yet any 1918\r\nequipped army would have beaten a 1914 one because of guns, heavy guns,\r\nsuper-heavy guns, mortars, shells, bombs, grenades, gas, machine guns,\r\nmachine rifles, automatic rifles, range-spotters, sound-detectors,\r\nsmoke, aeroplanes, lorries, railways, tramways, armoured cars, and\r\ntanks.\r\n\r\nWhat to-day would be thought of a mechanical engineer who applied 1870\r\nmethods? Nothing; he would go bankrupt in six weeks if he started\r\nbusiness on 1870 lines. This is exactly what the armies of 1914\r\ndid; they tactically went bankrupt because they were sufficiently\r\nbig, or the area of operations was sufficiently small, to deny to\r\nthem strategical movement. Could this have been foreseen? Given\r\nthe numbers, given the weapons, and given the area of operations,\r\na simple rule-of-three sum can be worked out, the answer to which\r\nis siege warfare and the tactics of which is the frontal attack of\r\npenetration;[38] yet every _Field Service Regulations_, in 1914,\r\nfavoured envelopment and paid but a passing attention to trench warfare.\r\n\r\nInevitably the preordained tactics of penetration were forced on the\r\ncontending parties, and human points were thrown over the parapets\r\nin handfuls; as if men, armed with a rifle and bayonet, who could\r\nonly secure their existence by remaining underground, had any chance\r\nwhatever of attaining a decisive victory by forsaking their shelters\r\nand facing weapons in the open which had previously forced them to\r\nearth. What was the result? The Germans failed at Ypres and Verdun;\r\nthe French in the Champagne, at Verdun, and at Reims; and we at Neuve\r\nChapelle, Loos, the Somme, Arras, and Passchendaele. Between 2,000,000\r\nand 3,000,000 casualties on one side of the balance sheet and a few\r\nsquare miles of uninhabitable ground on the other was the sum-total\r\nof these united endeavours, and all because no single army had, since\r\n1870, realised the mechanical side of the science of war. In October,\r\nten weeks after the war had opened, as the second chapter of this book\r\nhas already related, the mechanical side was realised and a solution\r\nwas found in the production of a chariot not so very dissimilar to that\r\ndepicted on the “Victory Stele of Eannatum” of Lagash, 3,000 years\r\nB.C.--no very novel mechanical invention!\r\n\r\nTime, a few months, was, however, requisite for the substitution of the\r\npetrol engine for the horses of the Assyrians, and as time could not\r\nbe wasted other mechanical lapses were made good which might have well\r\nbeen foreseen had penetration and not envelopment been diagnosed as the\r\nleading tactical act of the war.\r\n\r\nAt first each contending nation in turn passed through its barbed-wire\r\ncrisis, its gun shortage and its ammunition scandal. Millions of miles\r\nof wire were produced, thousands of guns were made, and ammunition was\r\nmanufactured not by thousands of rounds, but by hundreds of thousands\r\nof tons. Had any one side been able to fire at the other, in September\r\n1914, 100,000 tons in a couple of days, that side would have, probably,\r\nwon the war. This is practically what happened at the Dunajec in\r\n1915--the Russians were out-weaponed and consequently defeated.\r\n\r\nOn the Western Front, as the artillery competition was more or less\r\nmutual, stagnation became still more complete. In place of hurling men\r\nagainst uncut wire, shells were hurled instead, the bombardments being\r\nsufficiently long to enable the Germans to transport troops from the\r\neast of Poland to France in time to meet the assault. As the frontage\r\nof this assault was usually under ten miles, the total battle-front\r\nbeing over 500, the operation may be compared with that of attempting\r\nto take the life of a rhinoceros with a hat-pin. These tactics\r\ninevitably failed, not only through the impossibility of economically\r\nwearing away the enemy’s reserves, but on account of the impossibility\r\nof rapidly moving forward our own; for in the act of destroying wire,\r\nsimultaneously did the guns create an area so difficult to move over\r\nthat, had it been possible to advance the infantry, it would never have\r\nbeen possible to feed or supply them.\r\n\r\nThat stationary warfare should have increased in endurance as the\r\ngun-power of each side was multiplied was not necessary; this was\r\nclearly proved during the first two German battles of 1918. By this\r\ndate, on all sides, had artillery attained its zenith, but the Germans,\r\nby threatening a front of nearly 250 miles--practically from the\r\nChannel to the Meuse--and then, after an intense bombardment lasting\r\nbut a few hours, attacking on a comparatively wide front of some fifty\r\nmiles, were able to develop their machine power to its fullest effect,\r\nthat is to say, with the least opposition.\r\n\r\nIt took nearly three years from the date of the battle of the Dunajec\r\nbefore the use of the gun as a weapon of surprise was grasped; this\r\nwill probably prove one of the most astounding tactical anomalies of\r\nthe war. During this period two other weapons were devised which were\r\ndestined in most respects to outclass the gun; the idea of both must\r\nhave arisen at approximately the same time.\r\n\r\nFor years before the war the French and ourselves had been the leading\r\nmechanical engineers of Europe; in a similar respect the Germans were\r\nits leading chemists. Both, once a deadlock had arisen in the war,\r\nsought aid from the sciences they best understood during peacetime,\r\nand from which, had they understood war as a science, they would have\r\nlooked for assistance years before its present outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe first stroke of genius delivered in the war was the use the Germans\r\nmade of gas on April 22, 1915, and the second the use we made of tanks\r\non September 15, 1916; both failed through want of a scientific grasp\r\nof war. They were tentative attacks, not delivered in strength or mass,\r\nyet curious to relate both were delivered by armies which, having been\r\nbrought up in the 1870 school of thought, were fully conversant with\r\nthe old precept of “superiority of numbers at the decisive point”;\r\nbut, thinking in muscular terms only, they failed to apply it to the\r\nmechanical and chemical contrivances now placed at their disposal.\r\n\r\nBy many soldiers even to-day it is not realised that gas is a\r\nmissile weapon following directly along the evolutionary path of all\r\nprojectiles. A solid shot has to hit a target in order to injure it;\r\nas targets became difficult to see it became necessary to increase the\r\nradius of effect of the solid shot by replacing it by a hollow one\r\nfilled with explosive. By means of this shell, a target might be missed\r\nby the shell yet hit by a flying fragment; the danger zone of the solid\r\nshot was increased many hundreds of times. Once targets not only become\r\ninvisible but disappear into under-earth shelters, the shell has but\r\nlittle effect unless days are spent in bombardment, consequently the\r\nmost effective manner of hitting them is to replace the shell by a gas\r\ninundation which will cover extensive areas and percolate into trenches\r\nand shelters. Gas has, in fact, multiplied the explosive radius of\r\naction of a shell indefinitely, and had it been used in quantity by\r\nthe Germans before the Allies could protect themselves against it, the\r\nenemy might well have won the war.\r\n\r\nGas, whatever its possibilities were before this protection was\r\nobtained, remains but a projectile evolved as above described.\r\nTanks were a “creation,” and the introduction of the petrol-driven\r\ncross-country tractor on the battlefield, it is thought, will mark a\r\ndefinite close to the “alchemical” epoch of warfare. All war on land,\r\nin the past, has been based on muscular energy; henceforth it will be\r\nbased on mechanical. The change is radical, and Wilson’s “Big Willie”\r\nwill one day pass into legend alongside Stevenson’s “Rocket.” As steam,\r\napplied as a motive force, in 150 years changed the world more than\r\nit had previously been changed since the days of palæolithic man, so,\r\nbefore the present century has run its course, may as great a change\r\ntake place in the realms of war. The cause of both is the same: as the\r\ninvention of the steam engine rendered obsolete to a high degree the\r\nhand-tool and replaced it by the machine-tool, so the application of\r\npetrol to the battlefield will force the hand-weapon out of existence\r\nand replace it by the machine-weapon. That the tank will continue in\r\nits present form is as unlikely as it would have been to expect, in\r\n1769, that Watt’s pumping engine was the “Ultima Thule” of all such\r\nengines. It is not the form which is the stroke of true genius, but\r\nthe idea, the replacing of muscular energy by mechanical force as the\r\nmotive power of an army.\r\n\r\nHad the combatant nations of the Great War possessed more foresight,\r\nhad they thought of war as a science in place of as an insurance\r\npolicy, they could have had a steam-driven tank thirty years ago and a\r\npetrol-driven one immediately after the South African War. The Batter\r\ntractor existed, anyhow in design, in 1888, and during the South\r\nAfrican War Mr. W. Ralston drew a comic picture entitled “Warfare of\r\nthe Future: The Tractor Mounted Infantry in Action,” to say nothing\r\nabout the story by Mr. H. G. Wells. But no, the breath of ancient\r\nbattles had to be breathed, and whilst military students were studying\r\nJena, Inkerman, and Worth, the commercial sciences were daily producing\r\none invention after another which a little adjustment would help win\r\nthe next war more speedily than the study of scores of Jominis and\r\nClausewitzs.\r\n\r\nTo show how unscientific the soldiers of the 1870-1914 epoch had become\r\nit is only necessary to quote that after the battle of the Somme in\r\nthe highest German military circles the machine was considered as a\r\nveritable joke. Apparently it could not be seen that, though the Mark\r\nI tank was far from perfect, it, being able to reintroduce armour and\r\nto provide the soldier with a mobile weapon platform, revolutionised\r\nthe entire theory of 1870 warfare.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1916, the opening day of the battle of the Somme, the\r\nBritish Army sustained between 40,000 and 50,000 casualties. On\r\nSeptember 25, one single tank forced the surrender of 370 Germans at\r\na cost of five casualties to ourselves, yet in July 1917 the Mark IV\r\ntank was still considered but as a minor factor. Its design was not\r\nsufficiently reliable, its true powers were more or less a matter of\r\nconjecture; the troops were not fully accustomed to it, nor would\r\nthey place sufficient faith in it to accept it in lieu of artillery\r\nsupport, in fact, in its present state of development the tank was\r\nbut an adjunct to infantry and guns. Such were some of the views held\r\nregarding it when, like a bolt from the blue, the battle of Cambrai\r\nshot across the horizon of 1870 battles.\r\n\r\nAt Cambrai it was the Mark IV tank which was used, the same which\r\nhad existed in July; the Tank Corps had not increased materially in\r\nsize; the infantry were for the most part used-up troops--some had\r\nreceived a few days’ training with tanks, others had never even seen\r\nthese machines. The assault was an overwhelming success: at the cost\r\nof some 5,000 infantry casualties an advance was made in twelve hours\r\nwhich in extent took ninety days at Ypres, and which in this last-named\r\nbattle cost over a quarter of a million men. Yet, in spite of this\r\nastonishing success, so conservative had the Army grown to the true\r\nneeds of victory that there were certain soldiers who now stated that\r\nthe tactics employed at Cambrai could never be repeated again and that\r\nthe day of the tank had come and gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen came the “crowning mercy”--the attack on Hamel. Something had\r\nto be done to reinstate the credit of the Tank Corps. There were but\r\nthree suitable localities to do it in: the first, against the Merville\r\nsalient--the ground here was bad, being intersected by dikes and\r\ncanals; the second, eastward from between Arras and Hebuterne--the\r\nground here was much cut up, and the tactical objective was not\r\nsuitable; the third, eastwards from Villers-Bretonneux--the ground here\r\nwas excellent, but the Australians, who held this sector, had little\r\nconfidence in the tank.\r\n\r\nHuman prejudice is, however, not difficult to overcome to the student\r\nof psychology. After tactful persuasion the Australian Corps was\r\ninduced to accept sixty machines, as an “adjunct” to their operations.\r\nThe tanks (Mark V.s) were drawn up 1,000 yards _in rear_ of the\r\nattackers, yet, nevertheless, within a few minutes of the attack being\r\nlaunched, they caught up with the leading wave and carried this wave\r\nand those in rear right through to the final objective. The loss of the\r\n4th Australian Division was insignificant; their prejudices vanished\r\nand a close comradeship between them and the Tank Corps was established\r\nwhich redounds to their gallantry and common sense.\r\n\r\nHamel, minor incident though it was, was of more importance to the\r\nimmediate problems of the British Army than Cambrai itself. General\r\nRawlinson, commanding the Fourth Army, saw his opportunity, and the\r\nresult was that from Hamel onwards the war became a tank war. The\r\nmachine had made good in spite of prejudice and opposition. The Germans\r\nlost their heads, and with their heads they lost the war. That the\r\nwar might have been won without tanks is quite possible, but that\r\nfifty-nine British divisions would, without their assistance, have\r\nbeaten ninety-nine German ones in three months is extremely unlikely.\r\n\r\nWhat had the influence of the tank really been? Let us examine this\r\nquestion and so close this retrospect.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the tank’s mobility on grand tactics was stupendous.\r\nBetween the winter of 1914 and the summer of 1918, to all intents and\r\npurposes, the Allies waged a static war on the Western Front. During\r\nthese three and a half years various attempts were made to wear down\r\nthe enemy’s fighting strength as a prelude to a decisive exploitation\r\nor pursuit, but these battles of attrition were mutually destructive\r\nand the Allies undoubtedly lost more casualties than they inflicted.\r\nAttrition without the possibility of surprise or mobility is a mere\r\n“push of pikes,” it is a muscular but brainless operation. At the Third\r\nBattle of Ypres it cost us a quarter of a million men. Then came the\r\ntank, and true attrition was rendered possible; in other words, in tank\r\nbattles the enemy lost more in human points than we did: it is doubtful\r\nwhether in killed and wounded we lost, between August 8 and November\r\n11, 1918, as many men as the prisoners we captured. This was only\r\npossible by our possessing the means of putting the grand tactical act\r\nof penetration into operation, by breaking down the “inviolability” of\r\nthe German front, and by so doing rendering envelopment a reality.\r\n\r\nIn minor tactics it was possible, by means of the tank, to economise\r\nlife by harmonising fire and movement and movement and security; the\r\ntank soldier could use the whole of his energy in the manipulation of\r\nhis weapons and none in the effort of moving himself forward; further\r\nthan this, sufficiently thick armour could be carried to protect him\r\nagainst bullets, shrapnel, and shell splinters. Human legs no longer\r\ncontrolled marches, and human skin no longer was the sole protection to\r\nthe flesh beneath it. A new direction was obtained, that of the moving\r\nfiring line; the knight in armour was once again reinstated, his horse\r\nnow a petrol engine and his lance a machine gun.\r\n\r\nStrategy, or the science of making the most of time for warlike ends,\r\nhad practically ceased since November 1914. Even the great advances\r\nof the Germans in 1918 came to an abrupt stop through failure of\r\nroad capacity, and roads and rails form the network upon which all\r\nformer strategy was woven. The cross-country tractor, or tank, widened\r\nthe size of roads to an almost unlimited degree. The earth became a\r\nuniversal vehicle of motion, like the sea, and to those sides which\r\nrelied on tanks, naval tactics could be superimposed on those of land\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of mechanical movement every principle of war\r\nbecame easy of application and, to-day, to pit an overland mechanical\r\narmy against one relying on roads, rails, and muscular energy, is\r\nto pit a fleet of modern battleships against one of wind-driven\r\nthree-deckers. The result of such an action is not even within the\r\npossibility of doubt: the latter will for a certainty be destroyed, for\r\nthe highest form of machinery must win, because it saves time, and time\r\nis the controlling factor on the battlefield as in the workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nA FORECAST OF WHAT TANKS MAY DO\r\n\r\n\r\nAccepting war as a science and an art, that it is founded on definite\r\nprinciples which are applied according to the conditions of the moment,\r\nwe may scientifically reduce it to its component elements, which are:\r\nMen, weapons, and movement. A combination of these three is an army, a\r\nbody of men which can fight and move.\r\n\r\nTactics, or the art of moving armed men on the battlefield, change\r\ndirectly in accordance with the nature of the weapons themselves and\r\nthe mobility of the means of transport. Each new or improved weapon or\r\nmethod of movement demands a corresponding change in the art of war.\r\n\r\nTools, or weapons, if only the right ones can be discovered, form\r\n99 per cent. of victory. Strategy, command, leadership, courage,\r\ndiscipline, supply, organisation, and all the moral and physical\r\nparaphernalia of war are as nothing to a high superiority of weapons;\r\nat most they go to form the 1 per cent. which makes the whole possible.\r\nIndeed, as Carlyle writes, “Savage animalism is nothing, inventive\r\nspiritualism is all.”\r\n\r\nTo-day the introduction of the tank on the battlefield entirely\r\nrevolutionises the art of war in that:\r\n\r\n(i) It increases mobility by replacing muscular force by mechanical\r\npower.\r\n\r\n(ii) It increases security by rendering innocuous the effect of bullets\r\nthrough the feasibility of carrying armour plate.\r\n\r\n(iii) It increases offensive power by relieving the man from carrying\r\nhis weapons or the horse from dragging them, and by facilitating\r\nammunition supply it increases the destructive power of the weapons it\r\ncarries.\r\n\r\nIn other words, an army moved by petrol can obtain a greater effect\r\nfrom its weapons in a given time with less loss to itself than one\r\nwhich relies on muscular energy as its motive force. Whilst securing\r\nits crew dynamically a tank enables it to fight statically, it is in\r\nevery respect the “landship” it was first called.\r\n\r\nThese are our premises and from them we may deduce the following\r\nall-important fact: That in all wars, and especially modern wars--wars\r\nin which weapons change rapidly--no army of fifty years before any date\r\nselected would stand a “dog’s chance” against the army existing at this\r\ndate, not even if it were composed entirely of Winkelrieds and Marshal\r\nNeys. Consider the following examples:\r\n\r\n(i) Napoleon was an infinitely greater general than Lord Raglan; yet\r\nLord Raglan would, in 1855, have beaten any army Napoleon, in 1805,\r\ncould have led against him, because Lord Raglan’s men were armed with\r\nthe Minie rifle.\r\n\r\n(ii) Eleven years after Inkerman, Moltke would have beaten Lord\r\nRaglan’s army hollow, not because he was a greater soldier than Lord\r\nRaglan, but because his men were armed with the needle gun.\r\n\r\nFrom this we may deduce the fact, which has already been stated,\r\nnamely, that weapons form 99 per cent. of victory, consequently\r\nthe General Staff of every army should be composed of mechanical\r\nclairvoyants, seers of new conditions, new fields of war to exploit,\r\nand new tools to assist in this exploitation. Had Napoleon, in 1805,\r\noffered a prize of £1,000,000 for a weapon 100 per cent. more efficient\r\nthan the “Brown Bess,” it is almost a certainty that, by 1815, he would\r\nhave got it; for the want of a little foresight and for the want of the\r\nunderstanding that progress in weapons of war is a similar problem to\r\nprogress of tools in manufacture, he might have saved his Empire and\r\nended his days as supreme tyrant of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of the evolution of machine tools is that of the\r\nelimination of the workman and the replacement of muscular energy by\r\nsteam, electricity, or some other form of power. “Fewer men, more\r\nmachines, higher output” has during the last hundred years been\r\nthe motto of every progressive workshop. Likewise we believe that\r\nfrom now onwards in every progressive army will a similar motto be\r\nadopted. Further than this, we believe that those nations which have\r\nproved their ability in the past as leaders of science and mechanical\r\nengineering will in the future be those which will produce the most\r\nefficient armies, for these armies will be based on the foundations of\r\nthe commercial sciences.\r\n\r\nAccepting that the main factor in future warfare will be the replacing\r\nof man-power by machine-power, the logical deduction is that the ideal\r\narmy to aim at is _one_ man, not a conscripted nation, not even a\r\nsuper-scientist, but one man who can press a button or pull a plug\r\nand so put into operation war-machines evolved by the best brains of\r\nthe nation during peacetime. Such an army need not even occupy the\r\ntheatre of operations in which the war is to be fought; _he_ may be\r\nensconced thousands of miles away, perhaps in Kamtchatka, fighting a\r\nbattle on the Western Front. Is this impossible? Not at all; even in\r\nthe late war we can picture to ourselves a one-armed cripple sitting\r\nin Muravieff-Amourski and electrically discharging gas against the\r\nHindenburg Line directly his indicator announces a favourable wind.\r\n\r\nSo far the chemist, but is man going to be controlled by gas, are human\r\ndestinies to be limited by a “whiff of phosgene”?\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” answers the soldier mechanic. “It is true that the\r\nfuture may produce many unknown gases which, as long as they remain\r\nunknown to the opposing side, are unlikely to be rendered innocuous by\r\nmeans of a respirator; I, however, will scrap the respirator and place\r\nmy men in gas-proof tanks, and whenever my indicator denotes impure\r\nair, the crews will batten down their hatches, their engines will\r\nbe run off accumulators, and they themselves will live on oxygen or\r\ncompressed air. I will apply to land-warfare naval methods undreamt of\r\nbefore, I will produce a land machine which will, so to speak, submerge\r\nitself when the gas cloud approaches, just as a submarine submerges in\r\nthe sea when a destroyer draws near.”\r\n\r\nThere is an answer to every weapon, and that side which has most\r\nthoroughly thought these answers out during days of peace is the one\r\nwhich is most likely to produce a steel-shod Achilles for days of war.\r\n\r\nWithout journeying so far as Amourski let us imagine that war was to\r\nbreak out again three years hence and that we were equipped with a\r\ntank 200 per cent. superior to our at present best type--a machine\r\ntravelling at fifteen miles an hour in place of five, and that the\r\nGermans sitting behind their Hindenburg Line were still backing\r\npersonnel against matériel, numbers of men against perfection of\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nAn army is an organisation, comparable, like all other organisations,\r\nvery closely with the human body. It possesses a body and a brain; its\r\nfighting troops are the former, its headquarters staffs the latter. In\r\nthe past the usual process of tactics has been to wage a body warfare:\r\none body is moved up against the other body and like two boxers they\r\npummel each other until one is knocked out. But suppose that boxer\r\n“A” could by some simple operation paralyse the brain of boxer “B,”\r\nwhat use would all boxer “B’s” muscular strength be to him, even if it\r\nrivalled that of Samson and Goliath combined? No use at all, as David\r\nproved!\r\n\r\nNow apply this process to the battle of 1923. The tank fleets, under\r\ncover of dense clouds of smoke, or at night-time, move forward, not\r\nagainst the body of the enemy’s army but against his brains; their\r\nobjectives are not the enemy’s infantry or the enemy’s guns, not\r\npositions or tactical localities, but the billets of the German\r\nheadquarters staffs--the Army, Corps, and Divisional headquarters.\r\nThese they capture, destroy or disperse; what then is the body going\r\nto do, for its brain is paralysed? Who is going to control it, feed it\r\nwith reserves, ammunition, and supplies? Who is going to manœuvre it to\r\ngive it foot play? Either it will stand still and be knocked out, or,\r\nmuch more likely, it will be seized by panic and become paralysed to\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWhat is the answer to this type of brain warfare? The answer is the\r\ntank; the brains will get into metal skulls or boxes, the bodies will\r\nget into the same, and land fleet will manœuvre against land fleet.\r\n\r\nThe growth of these tactics may be slow, but eventually they will\r\nbecome imperative. It may be urged that the field gun is master of the\r\ntank in the open, just as a land battery is master of a ship at sea.\r\nThis is only true as long as the gunner can see his target, and no\r\nknown means at present exist whereby sight can penetrate a dense cloud\r\nof smoke. It may also be urged that a heavy machine gun will enable\r\nthe infantry to protect themselves against tanks. But to be mobile\r\nthe weight of the machine gun is limited to the carrying power of two\r\nmen--about 80 lb., and there is no known reason why a tank should not\r\nbe armoured to withstand the bullets of such a weapon. If a heavier\r\nmachine gun is made it will be forced to take to a mounting, and for\r\nchoice to a mechanical one; it will in fact become a tank or a tank\r\ndestroyer.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of armour in war has always been recognised, and its\r\ngeneral disuse only dates from the sixteenth century onwards. When\r\narmour could not be used other means of protection, all makeshifts,\r\nwere sought after--earth-works, entrenchments, use of ground, manœuvre,\r\nand covering fire, and as regards the last-named substitute it is\r\ninteresting to go back a little into history, for, even from a cursory\r\nstudy, we may better understand the present and foresee the future.\r\n\r\nIn the days of our Henry VIII a body of arquebusiers had to stand\r\ntwenty-five ranks deep in order to obtain continuity of fire; that is\r\nto say, that once the first rank had fired and doubled to the rear it\r\nwould only be ready loaded again when the twenty-fifth rank was about\r\nto discharge its pieces. By the days of Gustavus Adolphus, the art\r\nof musketry and the musket had so far improved as to permit of these\r\ntwenty-five ranks being reduced to eight. As improvement went apace we\r\nfind Frederick the Great reducing them to three, and Wellington in the\r\nPeninsula to two. Even in the early period of the revolutionary wars\r\nit was found necessary for light infantry to reduce the human target\r\nthey offered to the enemy’s fire by making use of extensions. In 1866\r\nextensions became more feasible on account of the Prussians being armed\r\nwith a breach-loading rifle; in 1870 they became more general; in 1899\r\nthey have grown to between ten and fifteen paces, which may be taken\r\nas the maximum for a man, armed with the magazine rifle, to deliver\r\none round per yard of front each minute. In 1904 trenches are made use\r\nof on an extensive scale, for as extensions cannot be increased if\r\nfire effect is to be maintained, some other form of protection must\r\nbe sought, and men, not being able to carry armour, must carry spades\r\ninstead and so still further immobilise themselves. In 1914, after a\r\nbrief hurry-scurry of open warfare, all sides take to earth and the\r\nspade reigns supreme.\r\n\r\nThen comes the reintroduction of armour with the tank, and what do we\r\nsee? Not only mobility and direct protection, but the reinstitution of\r\nthe firing line, not now morcelated at fifteen paces interval between\r\nthe men composing it, but at 150 to 300 paces between the tanks, the\r\nmechanical skirmishing fortresses of which it is built up. A tank with\r\na crew of 6 men can deliver fire at the rate of 300 rounds a minute, or\r\nequivalent to 30 riflemen at a South African War extension, and being\r\narmoured they suffer practically no loss and can consequently challenge\r\nnot only 30 riflemen but 300, any number, in fact, who are sent against\r\nthem. The logical conclusion to be drawn from this is that extensions\r\nare useless, trenches at best but static makeshifts, the infantryman\r\nmust don armour and, as he has not the strength to carry it, he must\r\nget into a tank. If this is common sense, let us attempt to visualise\r\nwhat a tank war of the future may entail.\r\n\r\nIn the mechanical wars of the future we must first of all recognise\r\nthe fact that the earth is a solid sea as easily traversable in\r\nall directions by a tractor as a sheet of ice is by a skater; the\r\nbattles in these wars will therefore more and more approximate to\r\nnaval actions. As trenches, as we know them, and the ordinary field\r\nobstacles now constructed will be useless, it may become necessary\r\nduring peacetime to turn the great strategical centres--manufactories,\r\nrailways, stores, seats of government, etc., into defended land-ports\r\nor protected power, fuel, and control stations. The fortifications\r\nof these will probably consist of immense dry moats and extensive\r\nminefields which will constitute a direct protection against tank\r\nattacks. Water obstacles will be useless, for the tank of a few years\r\nhence will undoubtedly be of an amphibious nature. To protect these\r\ncentres from the air, barracks, storehouses, mobilisation stores,\r\ntankodromes and aerodromes will all have to be constructed well\r\nbeneath the surface of the ground--in fact, the future fortress will\r\napproximate closely to a gigantic dugout surrounded by a field of land\r\nmines electrically manipulated.\r\n\r\nNear the frontier these defended ports will probably be equipped\r\nwith and linked up by lethal gas works--gas-producing and storage\r\nplants, lodged below the surface, which on war being declared can\r\ninstantaneously be set operating electrically by one man stationed\r\nhundreds of miles away if needs be. When this type of warfare is\r\ninstituted, mobilisation will not consist in equipping with weapons\r\na small section of the community, but in providing such of the civil\r\npopulation as cannot be rapidly evacuated from the area it is proposed\r\nto inundate, or placed in gastight shelters safely underground, with\r\nanti-gas appliances. Under these circumstances the defence of frontiers\r\nwill be organised according to prevailing winds, and signs of war will\r\nbe looked for not amongst military but civil movements.\r\n\r\nAs the gas-storage tanks are opened and the gas-producing plants\r\nset operating, fleets of fast-moving tanks, equipped with tons of\r\nliquid gas, against which the enemy will probably have no means of\r\nprotection,[39] will cross the frontier and obliterate every living\r\nthing in the fields and farms, the villages and cities of the enemy’s\r\ncountry. Whilst life is being swept away around the frontier fleets\r\nof aeroplanes will attack the enemy’s great industrial and governing\r\ncentres. All these attacks will be made, at first, not against the\r\nenemy’s army, which will be mobilising underground, but against the\r\ncivil population in order to compel it to accept the will of the\r\nattacker.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy will not accept peace terms forthwith, then wars in\r\nthe air and on the earth will take place between machines to gain\r\nsuperiority. Tank will meet tank, and, commanded from the air, fleets\r\nof these machines will manœuvre between the defended ports seeking\r\neach other out and exterminating each other in orthodox naval fashion.\r\nWhilst these small forces of men, representing perhaps 0·5 per cent.\r\nor 1 per cent. of the entire population of the country, strong through\r\nmachinery, are at death-grips with their enemy, their respective\r\nnations will be producing weapons for them; so, in the future, as\r\nmilitary fighting man-power dwindles must we expect to see military\r\nmanufacturing man-power increase.\r\n\r\nAre we safe in this little island of ours against the future? If\r\nat times, during the “alchemical” period of warfare, we have been\r\nthreatened and invaded, we may be certain that during the scientific\r\nperiod we shall be less secure than we have been in the past.\r\n\r\nFrom the present-day tank to one which can plunge into the Channel\r\nat Calais at 4 in the morning, land at Dover at six o’clock, and be\r\noutside Buckingham Palace for an early lunch will not probably require\r\nas many as the fifty-two years which have separated the _Merrimac_\r\nfrom the _Tiger_ or the _Queen Elizabeth_. If this is too remote a\r\nperiod for the present generation to grow anxious about, there is no\r\nreason why four or five years hence ships should not be constructed\r\nas tank-carriers, these machines being conveyed across the ocean and\r\nlaunched into the sea near the coast carrying sufficient fuel to move\r\nthem 300 or 400 miles inland. From ships as carriers it is but one step\r\nto aeroplanes as suppliers and lifters, and another to aeroplanes as\r\ntanks themselves.\r\n\r\nIf the evolution of war, in the past, has been slow, do not let us\r\nflatter ourselves that it is likely to remain so in the future. From\r\nthe gliders of the Wright Brothers the aeroplane rapidly evolved,\r\nand from a 40 H.P. engine of ten or twelve years back to-day the\r\nPorte “Super-Baby” triplane carries five engines of 400 H.P. each\r\nand the Tarrant triplane has a span of 131 feet and to drive it\r\nsix Napier “Lion” engines are used, developing no less than 3,000\r\nhorse-power. The tank is still in its infancy, but it will grow\r\nand one day in mechanical perfection and efficiency catch up with\r\nthe super-Dreadnought and the Handley Page, and what then? A close\r\nco-operation between the great mechanical weapons, the seaship, the\r\nairship, and the landship--or, if preferred, of boat, aeroplane, and\r\ntank--will take place. These weapons will approximate and unify,\r\nevolving one arm and not three arms, which will require one defence\r\nforce and not three. This, even to-day, is becoming more and more\r\napparent, and the sooner the brains of the future Defence Force are\r\ndeveloped the better for this nation, for to-day we are thinking, like\r\nmediæval magicians, in separate terms of air, water, and earth, and\r\nsome of us in those of gabions, lances, and blunderbusses.\r\n\r\nIf great wars can be restricted or abolished by word of mouth or\r\nwritten agreement, the above gropings into the future, even if\r\npossible, may never materialise; but even if this be so, many small\r\nwars lie in front of us, for Europe politically, since 1914, has\r\npractically gone back 400 years, the frontiers of the smaller nations\r\napproximating closely to those of the later Middle Ages. The more\r\nnations there are in the world the more wars there will be in the\r\nmaking, and as half the smaller nations of central and eastern Europe\r\nconsider war a national sport there is little likelihood of agreements\r\nbeing kept or peace being maintained; in fact, all agreements which\r\ncannot be compelled by brute force are likely to be treated as “scraps\r\nof paper.”\r\n\r\nTo enforce peace, power and the means of applying it will be needed by\r\nthe greater nations who by law will never quarrel; here the mechanic\r\nsteps forward and presents the nations concerned with the tank and the\r\naeroplane as a means towards this end. He is perfectly right; the\r\ngeneral introduction of mechanical weapons must bring with it the end\r\nof small wars if not also of civil disturbances.\r\n\r\nTake the case of the defence of India. What has always been the great\r\ndifficulty in our frontier expeditions? Not our enemy or his weapons,\r\nbut the country which enables the Afghan to evade our columns and\r\nimpede our advance. It is the resistance offered by natural obstacles\r\nwhich we have to overcome and not those imposed upon us by weapons\r\nwhich generally are vastly inferior to those with which our men are\r\nequipped.\r\n\r\nTake the case of a punitive expedition starting from Peshawer and\r\nproceeding to Kabul. The force will consist of three bodies of\r\ntroops--a small fighting advanced guard, a large main body protecting\r\nthe transport, and strong flank guards protecting the main body.\r\nOn account of the tactics which have to be adopted the advance is\r\nexcessively slow. The main body proceeding along the roads, which\r\nalmost inevitably coincide with the bottoms of the valleys, has to be\r\nkept out of rifle shot, consequently the flank guards have usually\r\nto “crown the heights” on each side of the road, which necessitates\r\nmuch climbing and loss of time. If the advance were over an open veldt\r\nland, as in South Africa, in place of in a hilly country, movement\r\nwould be simplified, but still will the flank guards have to be thrown\r\nout because the main body, consisting of men and animals, is pervious\r\nto bullets. This perviousness to bullets is the basis of the whole\r\ntrouble, and unless bullet-proof armour can be carried, when it does\r\nnot matter whether the rifle is fired at a range of two yards or two\r\nmiles, the only means of denying effect to the rifle is to keep it out\r\nof range of its target.\r\n\r\nThough up to a short time ago the carrying of armour was not a\r\nfeasible proposition, now it is, and there are few more difficulties\r\nin advancing up or down the Khyber with a well-constructed tank than\r\nacross the open. Armour, by rendering flesh impervious to bullets,\r\ndoes away with the necessity of flank guards and long straggling\r\nsupply columns, and our punitive expedition equipped with tanks can\r\nreach Kabul in a few days, and not only reach it but abandon its\r\ncommunications, as they will require no protection. If tank supply\r\ncolumns, which are self-protecting, are considered too slow, once the\r\nforce has reached Kabul its supply and the evacuation of its sick\r\n(there will be but few wounded) can be carried out by aeroplane. The\r\nwhole operation becomes too simple to be classed as an operation\r\nof war. Once impress upon the Afghan the hopelessness of facing a\r\nmechanical punitive force and he will give up rendering such forces\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn our many small wars of the past we have frequently been faced with\r\ndesert warfare, a warfare even more difficult than hill and mountain\r\nfighting. Here again the chief difficulty is a natural one--want of\r\nwater, and not an artificial one--superiority of the enemy’s weapons.\r\nIn 1885 Sir Henry Stewart started from Korti on the Nile to relieve\r\nGeneral Gordon: his difficulties were supply difficulties, and it\r\ntook him twenty-one days to reach Gubat, a distance of 180 miles.\r\nA tank moving at an average pace of ten miles an hour could have\r\naccomplished the journey in two days, and being supplied by aeroplane\r\ncould have reached Khartum a few days later. One tank would have won\r\nMaiwand, Isandhlwana, and El Teb; one tank can meet any quantity of\r\nTower muskets, or Mauser rifles for aught that; one tank, costing say\r\n£10,000, can not only win a small war normally costing £2,000,000, but\r\nrender such wars in the future highly improbable if not impossible. The\r\nmoral, therefore, is--get the tank.\r\n\r\nFrom small wars to internal Imperial Defence is but one step. Render\r\nrebellion hopeless and it will not take place. In India we lock up in\r\nan unremunerative army 75,000 British troops and 150,000 Indian. Both\r\nthese forces can be done away with and order maintained, and maintained\r\nwith certainty, by a mechanical police force of 20,000 to 25,000 men.\r\n\r\nWhat now is the great lesson to be learnt from the above examples?\r\nThat war will be eliminated by weapons, not by words or treaties or\r\nleagues of nations; by weapons--leagues of tanks, aeroplanes, and\r\nsubmarines--which will render opposition hopeless or retribution so\r\nterrible that nations will think not once or twice but many times\r\nbefore going to war. If the civilian population of a country know that\r\nshould they demand war they may be killed in a few minutes by the tens\r\nof thousands, they will not only cease to demand it but see beforehand\r\nthat they are well prepared by superiority of weapons to terrify their\r\nneighbours out of declaring war against them.\r\n\r\nWeapons we, therefore, see are, if not a means of ending war and\r\nridding the world of this dementia, a means of maintaining peace on a\r\nfar firmer footing than hitherto it has been maintained by muscular\r\npower. To limit the evolution of weapons is therefore to limit the\r\nperiods of peace. An Army cannot stand still, it must develop with the\r\ncivilisation of which it forms part or become barbaric. To equip our\r\nArmy to-day with bows and arrows would not reduce the frequency of\r\nwar, it would actually increase it, for according to his tools, so is\r\nman himself, and as an Army is built up of men, if these men are armed\r\nwith bows and arrows they will in nature closely approximate to the age\r\nwhich produced these weapons, the age which burnt Joan of Arc. Equally\r\nso will the Army of to-day, if in equipment it be not allowed to keep\r\npace with scientific progress, develop into a band of brigands, for in\r\n2019 the rifle and gun of to-day, and the civilisation which produced\r\nthem, will be as uncouth as the arquebus, the carronade, and the\r\nmanners of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIf a millennium is ever to be ushered in upon earth it will be\r\naccomplished through the development of brain-power and not through it\r\nbecoming atrophied. If war is to be rendered impossible the process\r\nwill be a slow evolutionary one, the desire of war gradually slowing\r\ndown, and its motive force energising some other ideal. To restrict\r\nwar by maintaining soldiers as ill-armed barbarians is to prevent it\r\nworking out its destined course. Human nature, in spite of Benjamin\r\nKidd, does not change in a generation, and the tendencies which beget\r\nwar will out until human nature has outgrown them. The world has a\r\nsoul, and like that of a man it must pass through years of love, hate,\r\nstriving and ambition before attaining those of wisdom and decay.\r\n\r\nThere may yet be many wars ahead of us, but one thing would appear to\r\nbe certain, and this is that small wars will disappear and great ones\r\nbecome less frequent, science rendering them too terrible to be entered\r\nupon lightly.\r\n\r\nTo-day we stand upon the threshold of a new epoch in the history of the\r\nworld--war based on petrol, the natural sequent of an industry based\r\non steam. That we have attained the final step on the evolutionary\r\nladder of war is most unlikely, for mechanical and chemical weapons may\r\ndisappear and be replaced by others still more terrible. Electricity\r\nhas scarcely yet been touched upon and it is not impossible that\r\nmechanical warfare will be replaced by one of a wireless nature,\r\nand that not only the elements, but man’s flesh and bones, will be\r\ncontrolled by the “fluid” which to-day we do not even understand. This\r\nmethod of imposing the will of one man on another may in its turn be\r\nreplaced by a purely psychological warfare, wherein weapons are not\r\neven used or battlefields sought or loss of life or limb aimed at; but,\r\nin place, the corruption of the human reason, the dimming of the human\r\nintellect, and the disintegration of the moral and spiritual life of\r\none nation by the influence of the will of another is accomplished.\r\n\r\nBe all these as they may, one fact stands out supreme in all types and\r\nconditions of war, and this is, that the strongest and most efficient\r\nbrain wins, which applies equally to all nations as it does to all\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nAnimal superiority over animal is based on muscle, human superiority\r\nover human is based on brain. The nation with the supreme brain will\r\neventually rule the world, and so long as war continues the Army with\r\nthe best brains (which also means the best weapons) will accomplish\r\nvictory with the least loss. Our Army from to-day must step forward;\r\n“to advance is to conquer,” and this applies in greater force to\r\nbrain-power than to muscle-power, for brains control muscles. To stand\r\nstill is to retrogress; to glance backwards is to lose time, and if\r\nwe pause now we are lost in the future. Do not, therefore, let us\r\nmark time on our own graves, do not let us hark back to 1914 with its\r\nrifles and its ammunition boots, its sabres and its horseshoes, and\r\nall its muscular barbarism; let us plan and let us think, thus shall\r\nwe penetrate the veil of the future, thus shall we learn how to equip\r\nour Army with a brain and with a body which united, if war be ever\r\nagain forced upon us, will compel victory at the smallest possible\r\ncost. Surely this is an ideal worthy of a great nation and of a great\r\nArmy, the object of which is to prevent war and to maintain peace, to\r\nprevent war by science and not by nescience, by progress and not by\r\nretrogression.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abancourt, 206, 231\r\n\r\n  Abbas Ridge, 100\r\n\r\n  Abbé, Bois de l’, 201\r\n\r\n  Abbeville, 34\r\n\r\n  Abelard, xv\r\n\r\n  Acheux, 58\r\n\r\n  Achicourt, 84, 105, 257\r\n\r\n  Achiet-le-Grand, 84, 176, 255\r\n\r\n  Achiet-le-Petit, 176, 292\r\n\r\n  Acq, 84\r\n\r\n  Adelpare, 208, 210\r\n\r\n  Admiralty, the, 18-20, 22, 25, 27-33\r\n\r\n  Agincourt, 2\r\n\r\n  Aillette, the, 196\r\n\r\n  Aisne, the, 14, 81, 189, 196-7, 215\r\n\r\n  Albert, 71, 175, 252-4\r\n\r\n  Alberta, 121-2\r\n\r\n  Aldershot, 9-11\r\n\r\n  Alexandria, 134\r\n\r\n  Ali El Muntar, 101, 130\r\n\r\n  Allen, Major G. W. G., M.C., xii\r\n\r\n  Alleux, Bois des, 173\r\n\r\n  Alvinzi, xiv\r\n\r\n  American Army, 270-2, 275, 277-84, 290\r\n\r\n  _American Machinist, The_, xii, 4\r\n\r\n  American Tank Corps, 268, 271-2, 274, 277-82, 284\r\n\r\n  Amervalles, 284\r\n\r\n  Amiens, 169, 217-29, 237, 243, 245, 247, 290\r\n\r\n  Ancre, the, 54, 57-9, 176, 196\r\n\r\n  Anneux, 150\r\n\r\n  Anti-tank tactics, 87-8, 260-5\r\n\r\n  Antwerp, 198\r\n\r\n  Applegarth tractor, 10\r\n\r\n  Aquenne, Bois d’, 202\r\n\r\n  Archdale, Captain O. A., xii\r\n\r\n  Archery in warfare, 2\r\n\r\n  Archinger, 4\r\n\r\n  Ardennes, the, 1\r\n\r\n  Argonne, the, 280\r\n\r\n  Armentières, 200\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Captain A. E., M.C., 235\r\n\r\n  Arnold, Lieutenant C. B., D.S.O., xiii, 235\r\n\r\n  Arrachis, Bois des, 208, 210\r\n\r\n  Arras, 81-9, 105, 108, 114, 144, 166, 250-3, 257-9\r\n\r\n  Arrol, Messrs.

By Roy Horniman.\r\n\r\n[8] The arrow was the means of immobilising the knight by forcing him\r\nto dismount. Horse armour was never very satisfactory. Regarding the\r\nmaces, a chronicler writes of their use by the archers at Agincourt:\r\n“It seemed as though they were hammering upon anvils.”\r\n\r\n[9] The idea of a mobile fortress or battle car is very old: chariots\r\nare known to have existed in Assyria as far back as the year 3500 B.C.\r\nThe Egyptians and Israelites both adopted them from this source. In\r\nBiblical times their tactical utility was considerable, as the Book of\r\nJudges relates. The Chinese, as early as 1200 B.C., made use of war\r\ncars armoured against projectiles.\r\n\r\n[10] Much of the following information is taken from an article\r\nentitled “The Forerunner of the Tank,” by H. H. Manchester, published\r\nin _The American Mechanist_, vol. 49, No. 15.\r\n\r\n[11] “The Forerunner of the Tank,” by H. H. Manchester.\r\n\r\n[12] For Edgeworth’s invention and the short summary of the\r\nfooted-wheel, etc., which follows see _The Engineer_, August 10, 1917,\r\nand following issues.\r\n\r\n[13] _The Engineer, ibid._\r\n\r\n[14] The machine constructed by the Trench Warfare Department was the\r\ndouble bogey car designed by the Pedrail Company, of which it will be\r\nremembered twelve were originally ordered by the “Landships Committee”\r\nand eventually abandoned. The resuscitation of this machine arose as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1915 the Trench Warfare Department approached the\r\nPedrail Company concerning the design of a flame projector with the\r\ncapacity of 12,000 gallons of petrol. In order to carry this weapon\r\nthe Pedrail Company suggested their original design, which, though it\r\nwas not approved of by the “Landships Committee,” was accepted by the\r\nTrench Warfare Department. One machine was placed on order and built\r\nat Bath by Messrs. Stothert and Pitt, the pedrails being manufactured\r\nby the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Co., Ltd., and the\r\nframe by Messrs. William Arrol. The machine when built weighed 32\r\ntons unloaded, was equipped with two 100 h.p. Astor engines, and when\r\ntested out on Salisbury Plain attained a speed of 15 miles an hour.\r\nOnly one of these machines was made, as eventually the idea of using\r\nmechanically driven flame projectors was abandoned.\r\n\r\n[15] This is the first appearance of the word “tank” in the history\r\nof the machine. Up to December 1915, the machines now known as\r\n“tanks” were, in the experimental stage, called “landships” or “land\r\ncruisers,” and also “caterpillar machine-gun destroyers.” On December\r\n24, whilst drafting the above report of the Conference it occurred\r\nto Colonel Swinton that the use of the above names would give away\r\na secret which it was important to preserve. After consultation\r\nwith Lieutenant-Colonel W. Daily-Jones, assistant secretary of the\r\n“Committee of Imperial Defence,” the following names were suggested by\r\nColonel Swinton--“cistern,” “reservoir,” and “tank,” all of which were\r\napplicable to the steel-like structure of the machines in the earlier\r\nstages of manufacture. Because it was less clumsy and monosyllabic the\r\nname “tank” was decided on.\r\n\r\n[16] On February 8, 1915.\r\n\r\n[17] The sponsons of the Mark I were only 10 mm. armour and not proof\r\nagainst A.P. bullets.\r\n\r\n[18] Map reference.\r\n\r\n[19] The original order was for 100, this was later on increased to 150.\r\n\r\n[20] The lighter form of tank was called “medium” because the French,\r\nby now, had produced the light Renault tank (see Plate III).\r\n\r\n[21] At this time, January 1917, General Swinton’s notes given in\r\nChapter IV were not known of at the Heavy Branch Headquarters.\r\n\r\n[22] Major O. A. Forsyth-Major (Second in Command of the Egyptian\r\nTank Detachment), on whose report this chapter is based, lost all his\r\ndocuments and maps at sea in May 1918 when the ship on which he was\r\nreturning to England was torpedoed and sunk, consequently some of the\r\ndates are missing.\r\n\r\n[23] “It is not some familiar spirit which suddenly and secretly\r\ndiscloses to me what I have to say or do in a case unexpected by\r\nothers; it is reflexion, meditation.”--NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n[24] This chapter is extracted from a project submitted by Headquarters\r\nTank Corps on June 11, 1917. It correctly visualised the Third Battle\r\nof Ypres, and the German artillery tactics adopted during it.\r\n\r\n[25] At this time the German reserves totalled about 750,000 men.\r\n\r\n[26] Breakdowns in the past had for the most part been due to bad\r\nground, not defective mechanism.\r\n\r\n[27] The statement made in the daily press that General Elles’ order\r\nran--“England expects every tank to do its damnedest,” was a pure\r\njournalistic invention and one in very bad taste.\r\n\r\n[28] “Battle Notes” were issued from time to time by Tank Corps\r\nHeadquarters to all tank crews. Their object was to stimulate “esprit\r\nde corps and moral.” They were human documents for the most part,\r\nreferring not only to the tank but also to other arms.\r\n\r\n[29] From this it must not be deduced that the officers and men of the\r\nTank Corps would not obey orders, but that the officer in command of\r\nthe Supply Companies was a student of human nature. Why order when a\r\nsimple act like this will do the ordering?\r\n\r\n[30] The German reports published in April asserted that tanks were\r\nused against the British Army on March 21. As nothing is definitely\r\nknown of their effect they probably failed to come into action.\r\n\r\n[31] General de Bourgon was a great friend of the Tank Corps; he\r\npresented its Headquarters mess with a charming trophy.\r\n\r\n[32] Nine heavy battalions with 324 machines and two medium battalions\r\nwith 96. Besides these tanks, there were 42 in mechanical reserve,\r\n96 supply tanks, and 22 gun-carriers. In all, and not counting the\r\nmachines of the 9th Tank Battalion, there were 580 tanks.\r\n\r\n[33] This was borne witness to by British troops near by.\r\n\r\n[34] Captain of the company to which this tank belonged.\r\n\r\n[35] This was contrary to Tank Corps “Standing Battle Orders.”\r\n\r\n[36] This report was written by Lieut. Arnold after his return from\r\nGermany. The tank was eventually found close to the railway on the\r\neastern side of the Harbonnières-Rosières road.\r\n\r\n[37] A supply tank is armed with one Lewis gun.\r\n\r\n[38] See “The Tactics of Penetration,” by Captain J. F. C. Fuller,\r\n_Journal of the Royal United Services Institution_, November 1914. This\r\narticle was written in April 1914.\r\n\r\n[39] During the war the normal system of detecting new gases was to\r\nexamine captured respirators, and from the chemicals they contained\r\ninversely deduce the gases they would protect their wearers against. In\r\npeacetime no such means of detection will be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nInconsistent hyphenation of words and names has not been changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nThe edges of some illustrations were lost in the binding by the\r\nscanning equipment. Illustrations have been moved between paragraphs,\r\nso some of the page numbers in the List of Illustrations no longer\r\nmatch the placement in this eBook. However, in versions of this eBook\r\ncontaining links, the links in those lists lead directly to the\r\ncorresponding illustrations.\r\n\r\nSome of the plates were missing the \"Plate\" caption, apparently due to\r\ncropping during the scanning process. Since other plates include that\r\ncaption, it has been restored to the ones from which it was missing.\r\n\r\nIndex not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.\r\n\r\nText uses “moral” rather than “morale”.\r\n\r\nPage 44: The \"CHARACTERISTICS\" table contains 11 columns and has been\r\nsplit into three parts in the Plain Text version of this eBook.\r\n\r\nPages 44-45: “Tyler engine” also is printed as “Tylor”.\r\n\r\nPage 182: In the “A. D. Signals” organization chart, it was unclear\r\nwhether the lower portion was a continuation of the upper line or\r\nsubordinate to the “1st Tank Brigade”. The chart has been reproduced\r\nhere as similarly to the original as possible.\r\n\r\nPage 213: “1·57” mm. must be a misprint for “157 mm.”\r\n\r\nPage 218: “Noyon-Montdidier” perhaps should be “Noyon--Montdidier”.\r\n\r\nPage 272: “2 in. trench-mortar bombs, each containing 50 lb. of ammonal”\r\nwas printed with those numbers.\r\n\r\nPage 310: “Kamtchatka” was printed that way.",
