One or two volumes are issued annually and distributed to\r\nlibraries and scientific organizations. A limited number of copies of\r\neach paper, in pamphlet form, is distributed to specialists and others\r\ninterested in the different subjects as soon as printed. The date of\r\npublication is printed on each paper, and these dates are also recorded\r\nin the tables of contents of the volume.\r\n\r\nThe _Bulletins_, the first of which was issued in 1875, consist of a\r\nseries of separate publications comprising chiefly monographs of large\r\nzoological groups and other general systematic treatises (occasionally in\r\nseveral volumes), faunal works, reports of expeditions, and catalogues of\r\ntype-specimens, special collections, etc. The majority of the volumes are\r\noctavos, but a quarto size has been adopted in a few instances in which\r\nlarge plates were regarded as indispensable.\r\n\r\nSince 1902 a series of octavo volumes containing papers relating to the\r\nbotanical collections of the Museum, and known as the _Contributions from\r\nthe National Herbarium_, has been published as bulletins.\r\n\r\nThe present work forms No. 73 of the _Bulletin_ series.\r\n\r\n                                                        Richard Rathbun,\r\n                          _Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution,\r\n                        In charge of the United States National Museum._\r\n\r\nWashington, D.

True,\r\n     _Head Curator, Department of Biology, U. S. National Museum._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beaked whales belonging to the family Ziphiidæ are, with the\r\nexception of the bottle-nosed whales of the genus _Hyperoödon_, among the\r\nrarest of cetaceans. Of the three genera _Mesoplodon_, _Ziphius_, and\r\n_Berardius_, so far as I have been able to ascertain from published\r\nrecords, specimens representing about one hundred individuals are known,\r\nand somewhat more than one-half of these belong to the first-named genus.\r\n_Berardius_ is the rarest genus, only about fourteen specimens having\r\nbeen collected thus far. The U. S. National Museum contains specimens\r\nrepresenting some twenty-five individuals of the three genera, or about\r\none-fourth of the material at present available. Among these are six\r\nspecimens of the genus _Berardius_, or nearly half of all that have been\r\nrecorded thus far.\r\n\r\nThe most important addition to the knowledge of these whales made during\r\nthe last quarter century was the discovery of representatives of the\r\nthree genera _Mesoplodon_, _Ziphius_, and _Berardius_, at Bering Island,\r\nin the North Pacific, by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, whereby the known range\r\nof the family was very greatly extended. Two of the forms were described\r\nby Doctor Stejneger in 1883, and the third by myself from a skull which\r\nhe collected. About one-half of the material which the Museum possesses\r\nconsists of that collected by Doctor Stejneger in Bering Island and that\r\nfrom the same locality presented by Mr. Nicholas Grebnitzki, Russian\r\ngovernor of the Commander Islands.\r\n\r\nAbout six years ago the National Museum received information and\r\nspecimens from correspondents showing that the range of the three genera\r\nfound at Bering Island extends to the eastern North Pacific, one genus\r\n(_Ziphius_) having been observed at Kiska Harbor, Alaska, another\r\n(_Mesoplodon_) at Yaquina Bay, Oregon, and the third (_Berardius_) at St.\r\nGeorge Island, Pribilof Group, Alaska, and near Cape Mendocino,\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nOn the east and west coasts of the United States the only occurrences of\r\nbeaked whales known to me are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n  _Mesoplodon bidens_:\r\n    Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. 1867.

No. 21112, U.S.N.M.) obtained at Bering Island, North Pacific\r\nOcean, in 1883, by Dr. L. Stejneger, and made the type of the species _M.\r\nstejnegeri_ True; (2) a skull and photographs (Cat. No. 143132, U.S.N.M.)\r\nof the same species, from Yaquina Bay, Oregon, obtained in exchange from\r\nMr. J. G. Crawford in 1904; (3) a skeleton, cast, and photographs of a\r\nyoung male (Cat. No. 23346, U.S.N.M.), hitherto supposed to represent _M.\r\nbidens_, caught at Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1889; and (4) a skeleton\r\nof an adult (Cat. No. 49880, U.S.N.M.) from the Chatham Islands, New\r\nZealand, representing _M. grayi_.[1]\r\n\r\nIn addition to this material, I have had the privilege of examining two\r\nskulls belonging to the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy, and hitherto\r\nsupposed to represent _M. bidens_, and two skeletons belonging to the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History. Of these last, one is that of an\r\nadult and was purchased by the American Museum under the name of _M.\r\nlayardi_, but was subsequently recognized to be a new species and was\r\ndescribed by Mr. Andrews, under the name of _Mesoplodon bowdoini_. The\r\nother is that of a young individual, and has been labeled _M. grayi_.\r\n\r\nAs already noted by Dr. G. M. Allen,[2] only four specimens of\r\n_Mesoplodon_ have been recorded hitherto from the Atlantic coast of the\r\nUnited States. These are:\r\n\r\n1. An adult, sex unknown, but probably female, 16 feet long, found at\r\nNantucket, Massachusetts, in 1867, and recorded by Prof. L. Agassiz.[3]\r\nThe skull of this individual is in the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy,\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n2. A young male, 12½ feet long, captured at Atlantic City, New Jersey,\r\nMarch 28, 1889. The skeleton (Cat. No. 23346, U.S.N.M.) is in the\r\nNational Museum.\r\n\r\n3. A young female, 12 feet 2 inches long, stranded at Annisquam,\r\nMassachusetts, August, 1898, and recorded by the late Alpheus Hyatt.[4]\r\nThe skeleton is in the museum of the Boston Society of Natural History.\r\n\r\n4. An adult female, said by fishermen who measured it to have been 22\r\nfeet long, entangled in pound nets at North Long Branch, New Jersey, July\r\n22, 1905, and recorded by Dr. Glover M. Allen.[5] The cranium of this\r\nindividual is preserved in the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy. The rostrum\r\nand mandible, which were originally obtained, were afterwards destroyed\r\nby accident.\r\n\r\nI have examined all this material. Writers who have had occasion to\r\nmention these four specimens thus far have referred them tacitly to\r\n_Mesoplodon bidens_ (Sowerby), but, after a careful study of them, I have\r\nascertained that while the Nantucket specimen belongs to that species,\r\nthe Atlantic City and Long Branch specimens represent _Mesoplodon\r\neuropæus_ (Gervais). This is a very interesting discovery, because the\r\nlatter species has been known hitherto only from a single skull, and its\r\nvalidity has been frequently questioned. The Annisquam specimen, as will\r\nbe seen later, presents characters which appear to ally it to _M.\r\ndensirostris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MESOPLODON BIDENS (Sowerby).\r\n\r\n    _Physeter bidens_ Sowerby, British Miscell., 1804, p. 1; Trans. Linn.\r\n          Soc. London, vol. 7, 1804, p. 310.\r\n    _Delphinus sowerbensis_ Blainville, Nouv. Dict. Hist. Nat., 2d ed.,\r\n          vol. 9, 1817, p. 177.\r\n    _Delphinus sowerbyi_ Desmarest, Mammalogie, pt. 2, 1822, p. 521.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only specimen from the Atlantic coast of the United States which can\r\nwith certainty be referred to this species is the one from Nantucket\r\nmentioned on page 3. Prof. L. Agassiz’s original notice of it is so brief\r\nthat it is quoted in full below:\r\n\r\n  Professor Agassiz also brought to the notice of the Society the\r\n  discovery of a Cetacean, new to America. The skull was exhibited, and\r\n  its peculiar features pointed out. It was obtained on the coast of\r\n  Nantucket by Messrs. H. M. and S. C. Martin, of Roxbury. It belonged to\r\n  the genus _Mesoplodon_, as characterized by Gervais, and ought to be\r\n  separated from the fossil _Ziphius_, described by Cuvier. Professor\r\n  Agassiz, however, questioned whether _Mesoplodon_ was not identical\r\n  with _Delphinorhynchus_, previously described by De Blainville. The\r\n  specimen found at Nantucket measured 16 feet in length.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SKULL.\r\n\r\nThe skull of this Nantucket specimen, which I have before me, is\r\nthoroughly adult. That the specimen is a female is probable from the fact\r\nthat the teeth (one of which is preserved), though fully developed, are\r\nonly two-thirds as broad and three-fourths as long as those of Sowerby’s\r\nspecimen (the type of the species), which was an adult male.[7] The skull\r\nis 765 mm. long, and about 30 mm. are lacking from the end of the beak,\r\nso that the original length was about 795 mm. It appears to be,\r\ntherefore, rather the largest skull of the species of which there is any\r\nrecord. The specimen itself, according to Dr. J. A. Allen, was 16 feet 3\r\ninches long.[8] The largest European skull appears to be the one in the\r\nEdinburgh Museum, described by Sir William Turner in 1872.[9] The length\r\nof this is 749 mm. The specimen was a female, but though the skull is so\r\nlarge, the mesirostral cartilage was not ossified, and the individual\r\nwas, therefore, probably not thoroughly adult. Two other European\r\nspecimens, of which the total length was almost identical with that of\r\nthe Nantucket specimen, were (1) the adult female obtained at Overstrand,\r\nEngland, in 1892, and recorded by Southwell and Harmer[10] (length 16\r\nfeet 2 inches, straight); (2) the adult male obtained at Brodie House,\r\nScotland, in 1800, and recorded by Sowerby[11] (length 16 feet). The\r\nlength of the skull is not given for either of these specimens. The adult\r\nmale obtained at Rugsund, Norway, in 1901, and recorded by Grieg,[12] was\r\nonly 15 feet 1 inch long, but some of the measurements of the skull are\r\nas large as, or even a little larger than, those of the Nantucket skull.\r\nThe total length of the skull was not given, as the end of the beak was\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nGrieg’s figures of the Rugsund skull afford a very satisfactory basis for\r\ncomparisons between that specimen and the Nantucket skull (Pl. 1, fig.\r\n1). Both skulls show the comparatively narrow frontal region, the\r\nmoderately developed tubercle anterior to the anteorbital notch, and the\r\nlow maxillary ridge, which are characteristic of the species. In both\r\nskulls the anterior prolongation of the ethmoid is lanceolate and flat,\r\nbut in the Rugsund skull the apex is truncated. In the latter also the\r\nposterior end of the mesirostral ossification is divided into three\r\nlongitudinal sections by two lateral and somewhat divergent grooves,\r\nwhile in the Nantucket skull there is only a single median groove. These\r\ndifferences may safely be regarded as individual. Toward the distal end\r\nthe surface of the ossification in the Nantucket is pitted and irregular\r\nand descends much below the level of the premaxillæ. It ends distally at\r\nthe same point with the vomer. In this skull the proximal end of the\r\npremaxillæ and adjoining plate of the maxillæ are somewhat less reflexed\r\nthan in the Rugsund skull. The shape of the superior margin of the\r\nsupraoccipital is alike in both.\r\n\r\nThere are no well-defined differences in the relative thickness of the\r\nbeak at the base or in the form and position of the visible portion of\r\nthe palatines, but in the Nantucket skull the mass of the combined\r\nfrontal and lachrymal anterior to the orbit is less rounded and more\r\ntriangular than in the Rugsund skull. The temporal fossæ also have a\r\npostero-superior angular enlargement not seen in the latter.\r\n\r\nIn the Nantucket skull the rostral portion of the premaxillæ is high and\r\nat the distal end vertical. The superior profile is somewhat convex, and\r\nthe superior free margin rounded proximally, but sharp distally. The\r\nleast distance between the free margins is 10 mm.\r\n\r\nThe pterygoids are cut off from the maxillæ anteriorly by a very narrow\r\nband of the palatine, which connects with a broad band externally and a\r\nlanceolate segment internally. The inferior pterygoid ridges diverge\r\nanteriorly. The broad surface internal to them is concave. The external\r\nborder of the pterygoid sinus is nearly straight. An elongated, fusiform\r\nsection of the vomer is visible on the inferior surface of the beak at\r\nthe middle for a distance of 158 mm., and a small lozenge-shaped section,\r\nill defined, is visible between the pterygoids and palatines. (Pl. 4,\r\nfig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe expanded anterior end of the malar is rhomboidal in form, with an\r\nexternal free margin 11 mm. long. Anteriorly it does not form part of the\r\nmargin of the anteorbital notch.\r\n\r\nThe lachrymal is irregularly oblong, with an external free margin 35 mm.\r\nlong and 12 mm. thick. The distance from the anteorbital notch to the\r\nanterior end of the orbit is 60 mm. (Pl. 7, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe lateral free margins of the basioccipital are extended posteriorly\r\nbeyond the exoccipitals, which is a character indicative of age.\r\n\r\nThe supraoccipital has a distinct median ridge, with a longitudinal\r\ndepression on each side, bounded externally by a prominent convexity.\r\n(Pl. 10, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe mandible is slender, with a very elongate symphysis, which measures\r\n237 mm. The inferior outline of the ramus is strongly concave at the\r\nmiddle and slightly convex posteriorly, while the symphysial portion is\r\nbent upward. The superior outline is concave both behind and before the\r\ntooth, and also immediately anterior to the coronoid process. At about\r\nthe beginning of the posterior fourth the outline is convex, and the\r\nmandible at this point is nearly as deep as at the coronoid process. The\r\nsuperior surface of the symphysis slopes down on each side to the median\r\nline, but each half of the surface is itself nearly plane. (Pl. 11, figs.\r\n1, 2, and 5.)\r\n\r\nThe alveolar groove anterior to the tooth is very distinct throughout and\r\nis without septa and open at the bottom. It ends distally in a rounded\r\naperture 6 mm. in diameter, below which are several small foramina. These\r\nlead to a very large canal which occupies all the symphysial portion of\r\nthe mandible, the walls being comparatively thin. Behind the tooth the\r\nalveolar groove becomes narrower gradually and disappears in a length of\r\nabout 140 mm.\r\n\r\nThe mental foramen is situated in line with the anterior base of the\r\ntooth, and is confluent with a groove which extends forward for about 80\r\nmm. A rather shallow groove runs along the inferior margin of the\r\nsymphysis.\r\n\r\nThe coronoid process is erect and rounded, and is joined by a horizontal\r\nridge anteriorly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe mandibular tooth, which is shown in Pl. 2, fig. 3, is preserved on\r\nthe right side only. Its dimensions are as follows: Length anteriorly in\r\na straight line, 75 mm.; length from the apex to the posterior end of the\r\nroot, straight, 60; greatest antero-posterior breadth, 28; transverse\r\nthickness, 10; height of apex above internal superior margin of jaw when\r\ntooth is in situ,[13] 22; antero-posterior length of base of exposed\r\nportion, 30; distance from anterior end to posterior end of root, 37;\r\ngreatest height of the exposed dentine crown, above the cement, 14;\r\nlength of the base of the dentine crown, 12.\r\n\r\nThis tooth, as already stated, is only two-thirds as broad and\r\nthree-fourths as long as that of Sowerby’s Brodie House specimen (the\r\ntype of the species), which was an adult male, and leads to the belief\r\nthat the Nantucket specimen was a female. This is in a manner confirmed\r\nby the Rugsund specimen, which was an adult male and had teeth as large\r\nas Sowerby’s specimen. It has to be remarked, however, that in the\r\nOverstrand, England, specimen (1892), which was an adult female, the\r\nteeth did not project beyond the gums. Messrs. Southwell and Harmer say\r\nregarding it:\r\n\r\n  The jaws were apparently completely edentulous, and although it was\r\n  possible to feel through the gums a slight prominence on either side in\r\n  the position of the teeth of the male, we could not by this means\r\n  definitely satisfy ourselves with respect to this point, nor were we\r\n  able to ascertain the presence of any other rudimentary teeth in either\r\n  jaw. The evidence which exists on this subject is favourable to the\r\n  view that the female of this species is not provided with any teeth\r\n  which are large enough to pierce the gums.[14]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the teeth in the Nantucket specimen, though quite\r\nlarge, did not project beyond the gums any considerable distance. The\r\nexternal border of the alveolar groove behind the tooth is only 20 mm.\r\nbelow the apex of the tooth, and it is not unlikely that the gums in a\r\nspecimen of this size had nearly that thickness, so that only the tip of\r\nthe tooth would project beyond them. Though the apex is acute, it has a\r\nflat abraded surface anteriorly, which, however, is but 4 mm. long. It\r\nseems probable, on the whole, that the teeth in the female may be quite\r\nlarge without projecting more than a few millimeters beyond the gums.\r\n\r\nIn shape the tooth of the Nantucket specimen is almost identical with\r\nthat of Sowerby’s Brodie House adult male, as figured by Lankester. The\r\ndentine at the apex is more nearly white than the cement which surrounds\r\nit. The superior margin of the latter is not a plain ring, but sends\r\nupward a papilliform projection on each side. The dentine itself has two\r\nvertical grooves on each side. The root of the tooth ends very obliquely\r\nand is rugose and irregular. The cavity is closed.\r\n\r\nGrieg remarks as follows regarding the structure of the teeth of the\r\nRugsund specimen:\r\n\r\n  Sections and microscopic preparations of the alveolar tooth of this\r\n  whale show that its apex consists of dentine, within which is found an\r\n  inner pulp cavity 4 mm. long and 1 mm. broad. The dentine, the\r\n  structure of which agrees with that which Turner found in _Mesoplodon\r\n  bidens_ and _Mesoplodon layardi_, is yellowish white, with the\r\n  exception of the part nearest the pulp cavity, which is yellowish\r\n  brown. It seems to correspond most closely to what Ray Lankester called\r\n  osteodentine. Throughout the tooth the dentine is covered with a very\r\n  thin layer of shining white enamel. The enamel is, however, lacking on\r\n  the front of the tooth, having probably been worn away. A section\r\n  through the middle of the tooth, at right angles with the V-shaped\r\n  furrow, shows a yellowish cement layer from 3 to 5 mm. broad, which is,\r\n  however, worn away on the front of the tooth. Within the cement layer\r\n  is a white, amorphous, calcareous mass, forming a band from 1.5 to 3.5\r\n  mm. broad, which appears to correspond to Ray Lankester’s “globular\r\n  matter” and Turner’s “modified vasodentine.” The mass seems to agree\r\n  most closely with Ray Lankester’s “globular matter,” as it has “no\r\n  structure excepting an indistinct botryoidal character visible with a\r\n  low magnifying power.” The core of the tooth consists of dentine, the\r\n  inner layer of which is brownish, while the outer is rather whitish\r\n  yellow. As above mentioned, the dentine is visible on the front of the\r\n  tooth, since both the cement and the amorphous, calcareous mass are\r\n  worn away. Moreover, it is clear that on the front of the tooth the\r\n  dentine is not covered by enamel. The pulp cavity is reduced to a fine\r\n  pore. A section across the root of the tooth shows an outer yellowish\r\n  cement layer, from 2 to 5 mm. broad, while the interior of the tooth is\r\n  filled with a white, amorphous, calcareous mass, which is interspersed\r\n  with thin yellowish lamellæ of dentine. Here and there, also, thin\r\n  lamellæ are seen to extend from the outer cement layer into the white,\r\n  amorphous, calcareous mass. The dentine lamellæ appear to be identical\r\n  with what Ray Lankester calls osteodentine. No pulp cavity is visible\r\n  in the root of the tooth.[15]\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the Nantucket skull are given in the following table in\r\ncomparison with those of seven European skulls of _M. bidens_.

Nat., 2d ed.,\r\n          vol. 9, 1817, p. 178.\r\n    _Ziphius seychellensis_ Gray, Zoöl. _Erebus and Terror_, 1846, p. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skull of the specimen from Annisquam, Mass., (Pl. 1, fig. 2) is, I\r\nregret to say, in rather poor condition. It is broken in the left orbital\r\nregion, and all the bones, especially those of the beak, are warped by\r\nweathering. The proximal extremity of the left premaxilla is lacking and\r\nalso the tip of the beak.\r\n\r\nThe skull is obviously that of a young animal, as all the sutures are\r\nopen and the surface of the occipital condyles is pitted, owing to\r\nimperfect ossification.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dimensions of the skull, with a few exceptions, agree well\r\nwith those of young specimens of _M. bidens_, as shown by the foregoing\r\ntable (p. 8), certain differences stand out conspicuously. The most\r\nsalient of these is the depth of the beak as a whole and the depth and\r\nshape of the rostral portion of the premaxillæ. The latter portion of the\r\npremaxillæ instead of being low, with a straight inferior margin, is very\r\nhigh, with the inferior margin strongly convex. At the middle of the beak\r\nthe premaxillæ are higher than the maxillæ on which they rest. It is true\r\nthat the shape of the beak varies greatly with age in _bidens_ and other\r\nspecies of _Mesoplodon_, but I do not find any evidence that such a\r\nchange as is here indicated takes place in _bidens_. The form of the beak\r\nand of the rostral portion of the premaxillæ is that of _M.\r\ndensirostris_.\r\n\r\nThe beak is almost as broad at the base as in _bidens_, but the lateral\r\nfree margin of the maxilla anterior to the anteorbital notch instead of\r\ncontinuing along the side of the beak nearly to the tip, as in _bidens_,\r\nends at a point about 90 mm. in front of the line of the notch, beyond\r\nwhich the sides of the beak are vertical.\r\n\r\nThe margin of the maxilla immediately anterior to the anteorbital notch\r\nis a little damaged, but there was apparently no strong tubercle at this\r\npoint, and the surface of the maxilla, though convex, is not raised into\r\na distinct ridge. In a young skull, however, one would not expect to find\r\na high ridge. The palatines are visible from above, which is not the case\r\nin _bidens_.\r\n\r\nThe maxillary foramen is situated a little in advance of the premaxillary\r\nforamen and is directed forward, and, as Dr. Glover M. Allen has pointed\r\nout, connects with a broad groove which runs forward along the\r\ntriangular, horizontal portion of the maxilla at the base of the beak.\r\nThe maxillæ are much broader behind the notch than in _bidens_, and the\r\nanterior end of the malar forms the bottom of the notch. The premaxillæ\r\nare noticeably constricted immediately in front of the premaxillary\r\nforamina, and the expanded portion just behind these foramina is nearly\r\nhorizontal, with a low transverse ridge near the middle. The proximal end\r\nof the premaxillæ is nearly vertical. The anterior nares are noticeably\r\nsmall. The foramen magnum is large, with a trifoliate outline (Pl. 10,\r\nfig. 2). The palate at the proximal end presents a median ridge with a\r\nnarrow groove on each side. The palatines extend as a broad band much\r\nbeyond the pterygoids anteriorly. The vomer is visible below for a space\r\nof 142 mm. near the end of the beak. A very small piece is also visible\r\nat the base of the beak, between the palatines and pterygoids. The\r\ninferior surface of the pterygoids is convex on the side adjoining the\r\nlateral free margin (Pl. 4, fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThis skull is peculiar in that there is no very distinct basirostral\r\ngroove and that the basirostral ridge, as already stated, extends forward\r\nonly about 90 mm. Below this ridge is a shallow broad groove which\r\nnarrows rapidly forward and can be traced to the extremity of the beak,\r\nwhere it broadens out somewhat (Pl. 7, fig. 2).\r\n\r\nWhile this skull agrees in size and in many of its proportions with\r\nsimilar skulls of _M. bidens_, it differs from that species and agrees\r\nwith _M. densirostris_ in the breadth across the anteorbital region, in\r\nthe depth of the beak and its shape at the base, in the shape of the\r\npremaxillæ both distally and proximally, in the direction of the\r\nmaxillary foramen, and the shape of the maxillary bone in front of the\r\nsame, in the occupation of the base of the maxillary notch by the\r\nanterior end of the malar, in the absence of any distinct maxillary ridge\r\nabove the notch, in the forward extension of the palatines, and in the\r\nshape of the foramen magnum.\r\n\r\nFlower states that there is a deep basirostral groove in _M.\r\ndensirostris_,[16] but neither the figure in Gervais’ Zoologie et\r\nPaleontologie Française,[17] nor that in Van Beneden and Gervais’\r\nOstéographie des Cétacés,[18] shows such a groove. The conformation of\r\nthe base of the rostrum appears to be about the same as in the Annisquam\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nIn regard to differences between this skull and those of _M.\r\ndensirostris_ it should be stated that in the latter the premaxillary\r\nforamina are situated farther apart, and that the maxillary foramina are\r\nsituated considerably in advance of those of the premaxillæ instead of\r\nnearly in line with them.\r\n\r\nThe Annisquam skull approaches _M. europæus_ in several characters, but\r\nthese are such as _europæus_ shares with _densirostris_. The principal\r\nones are the breadth of the maxillæ in front of the orbits, the presence\r\nof the malar in the base of the anteorbital notch, and the convexity of a\r\npart of the inferior surface of the pterygoids.\r\n\r\nDr. Glover M. Allen has given an account of the exterior, skeleton, and\r\nteeth of this specimen, from which the following particulars are\r\nextracted:[19]\r\n\r\n  Regarding the Annisquam specimen no color notes were taken, but from a\r\n  few small photographs in the possession of the Boston Society of\r\n  Natural History, it appears evident that the ventral portion was of a\r\n  lighter tint, and in one of the views a few oval whitish spots are seen\r\n  on the side a trifle behind the middle portion of the body. Another\r\n  view shows the convexity of the posterior margin of the flukes at the\r\n  median point, as well as the prominent dorsal fin. The lower jaw\r\n  protruded slightly beyond the upper. Measurements of this specimen, as\r\n  noted by Professor Hyatt, are as follows: Total length, 12 feet 2\r\n  inches; from anus to bight of flukes, 3 feet 4 to 6 inches; across\r\n  flukes, 3 feet 1 inch; from tip of rostrum to angle of mouth, 1 foot 1½\r\n  inches. The gular furrows were noted as about 10 inches long and from ¼\r\n  to ½ an inch deep.\r\n\r\n  The teeth of the Annisquam specimen barely projected above the alveoli\r\n  of the jaws and are sharply mucronate. The basal portion of each,\r\n  however, is more like that of the male’s tooth [_M. europæus_] in the\r\n  slightly convex posterior outline and the forward extension of the\r\n  anterior angle. * * *\r\n\r\n  The Annisquam skeleton has 45 vertebræ. Four of the seven cervicals are\r\n  fused. The atlas, axis, and third cervical are firmly anchylosed\r\n  throughout, save for the lateral foramina for the passage of the\r\n  cervical nerves. The fourth cervical is fused to the third by the\r\n  dorsal spine on the left side and by the tip of the upper lateral\r\n  process of the same side. Its centrum, right half of the dorsal spine\r\n  (the spine is divided medially), and the remaining lateral processes\r\n  are free. * * * The epiphyses of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebræ\r\n  and the anterior epiphysis of the sixth cervical are fused to their\r\n  respective centra, but all the other epiphyses of the vertebral column\r\n  and of the pectoral limbs are free.\r\n\r\n  The Annisquam skeleton has nine dorsal vertebræ with their\r\n  corresponding pairs of ribs. * * * The sternum of this specimen\r\n  presents few points of interest. It consists of four pieces, the\r\n  anterior-most of which is largest, slightly hollowed above, and\r\n  correspondingly convex below. The three remaining pieces are nearly\r\n  flat, with a deep median notch at the anterior and posterior border of\r\n  each. The posterior piece evidently represents a fusion of the elements\r\n  of two segments, as there are articular surfaces for two pairs of ribs.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, it appears that the Annisquam specimen probably had\r\none or two vertebræ less than _bidens_ or _europæus_, and that the\r\nsternum was somewhat differently shaped. The tooth, which is figured by\r\nDoctor Allen, is conical, compressed, 54 mm. long, 30 broad at the base,\r\nand resembles teeth of immature _bidens_.\r\n\r\nAlthough with such scant material it is not possible to determine\r\nsatisfactorily the identity of this third species of _Mesoplodon_ in the\r\nNorth Atlantic, represented by the Annisquam specimen, I feel convinced\r\nthat that specimen does not belong to _M. bidens_ and that there is a\r\nstrong probability that it belongs to _M. densirostris_. It is true that\r\nthe latter species has been found hitherto only in the Indian Ocean and\r\nabout Australia, but we know so little about the distribution of the\r\nziphioid whales that, in my opinion, that circumstance by itself should\r\nnot be given very great weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MESOPLODON EUROPÆUS (Gervais).\r\n\r\n    _Dioplodon europæus_ Gervais, Zool. et Pal. franç., 1st ed., vol. 2,\r\n          1848-1852, p. 4; 2d ed., 1859, p. 289, pl. 40, figs. 3-6.\r\n    _Dioplodon gervaisi_ Deslongchamps, Bull.

Mus.,\r\n          1871, p. 101.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis species was based on a single specimen found floating in the English\r\nChannel about seventy years ago. An account of the circumstances under\r\nwhich it was found was given by Eugène Deslongchamps in 1866, as follows:\r\n\r\n  The head, which forms the subject of this last note, was given to my\r\n  father some twenty-five or thirty years ago by Mr. Abel Vautier, a\r\n  merchant and armorer of our town, who died at Paris two years since.\r\n\r\n  The captain of one of Mr. Vautier’s ships, on his return from a voyage\r\n  to the colonies, saw floating on the water, at the entrance to the\r\n  English Channel, the body of a large animal entirely covered by birds\r\n  (large and small gulls, etc.), which were devouring it. The ship\r\n  approached the stray, and the captain, knowing that Mr. Abel Vautier\r\n  was greatly interested in natural objects, had the head of the cetacean\r\n  cut off, fastened it securely with a cord, and let it trail behind the\r\n  ship. When he arrived at Caën he made a present of it to Mr. Vautier.\r\n  The piece had at that time an appearance anything but agreeable. Mr.\r\n  Vautier was especially fond of beautiful objects which please the eye,\r\n  and hence he offered it to my father, saying, “You, who are an\r\n  anatomist, can make better use of this than I can.” My father was\r\n  unwilling to refuse the present, but neither he nor Mr. Vautier knew as\r\n  yet of its extreme rarity. It is in fact, up to the present time, the\r\n  only specimen which exists, and is a unique object in collections.[20]\r\n\r\nNo additional specimens have been recorded from European waters or\r\nelsewhere, and much doubt has been thrown on the validity of the species,\r\nmany zoologists regarding it as an adult of the commoner species _M.\r\nbidens_. Van Beneden remarked in 1888:\r\n\r\n  The opinions of naturalists are divided as regards the identity of this\r\n  ziphioid, which is unique up to the present time. In the eyes of some\r\n  it represents an old male of the common _Mesoplodon_, in which the\r\n  tooth, instead of developing near the middle of the jaw, has developed\r\n  near the anterior extremity. This is the opinion of Doctor Fischer and\r\n  others, who think that this unique specimen represents merely an\r\n  individual modification and that consequently it should not figure in\r\n  the list of species. We do not share this opinion. It is not impossible\r\n  that this ziphioid may belong to the other hemisphere, and this would\r\n  explain why only one single individual has been captured in Europe.[21]\r\n\r\nIn view of the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the original\r\nspecimen, it is of great interest to find that two of the specimens from\r\nthe east coast of the United States represent the same species. As one of\r\nthem is adult and the other young, the view that the type of _M.\r\neuropæus_ is merely an old individual of _M. bidens_ is satisfactorily\r\ndisposed of, as is also the opinion that it represents a singular\r\nindividual variation.\r\n\r\nThe two American specimens which represent _europæus_ are those from\r\nNorth Long Branch, New Jersey (adult female; skull, lacking rostrum and\r\nmandible, in the Museum of Comparative Zoology), and from Atlantic City,\r\nNew Jersey (young male; skeleton, cast and photographs in the U. S.\r\nNational Museum, Cat. No. 23346).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SPECIFIC CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nThe species _europæus_ differs from _bidens_ in the following characters,\r\nwhich may be regarded as diagnostic:\r\n\r\nSize larger and pectoral limbs relatively shorter and narrower.\r\n\r\nThe expanded portion of the maxillæ and frontals broader in front of the\r\norbit. The protuberance which projects into the anteorbital notch much\r\nlarger and the ridge on the maxilla which extends backward from it much\r\nhigher. Distance from inner margin of maxillary foramen to tip of\r\nprotuberance much more than one-half the distance between the maxillary\r\nforamina of the two sides. Rostrum deeper at the base. Inferior surface\r\nof pterygoids more or less convex, with a ridge (in adults) running\r\ndiagonally across it.\r\n\r\nThe cranial characters above enumerated are found in the type-skull, as\r\nwill be seen by examining the excellent figures in Van Beneden and\r\nGervais’ Osteography, plate 24.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Glover M. Allen’s account of the Long Branch specimen[22] it is\r\nstated that the fishermen who measured it reported that it was 22 feet\r\nlong, while none of the European specimens (some of which were certainly\r\nadults) was more than 16½ feet long. That the measurement reported by the\r\nfishermen is at least approximately correct appears from the fact that\r\nthe skull is larger than that of any of the European specimens. The beak\r\nis missing, so that the total length of the skull can not be given, but\r\nthe distance from the occipital condyles to the line of the maxillary\r\nnotches (straight) is 312 mm., while in the largest adult among the\r\nEuropean specimens this distance is only 260 mm., and in the thoroughly\r\nadult Nantucket specimen 282 mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SKULL.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic City and Long Branch skulls also agree in numerous other\r\ndetails of structure in addition to the foregoing, the more important of\r\nwhich will now be mentioned. Unless otherwise stated, the type-skull, as\r\nshown by Van Beneden and Gervais’ figures,[23] also presents the same\r\npeculiarities in contrast with _M. bidens_.\r\n\r\n_Dorsal aspect_ (Pl. 2, figs. 1 and 2).—The premaxillæ are more depressed\r\nimmediately in front of the blowhole than in _M. bidens_, which, with the\r\nprominence of the maxillary ridges, makes this whole region appear\r\nstrongly concave. The blowhole is narrower absolutely and also relatively\r\nto the breadth of the expanded proximal ends of the premaxillæ, so that\r\nwhile in _bidens_ the breadth of the blowhole is much more than one-third\r\nthe breadth across the proximal ends of the premaxillæ, in _europæus_ it\r\nis considerably less than a third. Both premaxillæ are much constricted\r\non the sides of the blowhole and the effect is heightened by the greater\r\nexpansion of the proximal ends of the former. These ends do not fit\r\nclosely against the adjoining edge of the maxillæ as in _bidens_, but\r\nleave a transverse vacuity, or trough, which is especially noticeable in\r\nthe type-skull. The anterior end of the malar bone occupies the bottom of\r\nthe maxillary notch and a small portion of it is visible from above,\r\nwhile in _bidens_ it does not extend up into the notch at all from the\r\ninferior surface and is not visible from above. The posterior margin of\r\nthe maxillæ is more squared in _europæus_ than in _bidens_.\r\n\r\nThe margins of the beak, formed by the maxillæ, instead of being\r\nstraight, are somewhat emarginate a little posterior to the middle of the\r\nlength and somewhat convex anterior to it, which gives the contour of the\r\nbeak, seen from above, a different shape from that of _bidens_. In the\r\ntype-skull of _europæus_ the mesirostral ossification appears to be\r\nhigher at the proximal end than the premaxillæ, and distally extends to\r\nthe end of the beak. In _bidens_ it is lower than the premaxillæ and, in\r\nthe Nantucket skull at least, ends anteriorly at the same point as the\r\nvomer, or, in other words, much behind the end of the beak. It would\r\nappear from the statements of Sir William Turner, Van Beneden and\r\nGervais, Grieg, and others, that the mesirostral ossification never\r\nreaches the end of the beak in _bidens_, but it does in _grayi_,\r\n_haasti_, _densirostris_, and many fossil species, as well as in\r\n_europæus_.\r\n\r\n_Lateral aspect_ (Pl. 8, figs. 1, 2).—The temporal fossæ are a little\r\nlonger than the orbit in _europæus_, but a little shorter than the orbit\r\nin _bidens_; in the former the superior margin is flat or a little\r\nconcave, rather than convex. The exoccipital extends in an angle farther\r\nforward in _europæus_, and the suture between it and the zygomatic is, in\r\nconsequence, less nearly vertical than in _bidens_. The premaxillæ at the\r\nsides of the blowhole are nearly horizontal, so that their superior\r\nsurface is little seen from this aspect, while in _bidens_ they slope\r\ndownward, so that the whole of the superior surface is visible. The high\r\nmaxillary ridge, situated behind the anteorbital notch, is very\r\nnoticeable from this point of view, as it shuts off a considerable\r\nportion of the premaxillæ. The convex inferior outline of the beak and\r\nits great depth at the base are also salient peculiarities.\r\n\r\n_Ventral aspect_ (Pl. 5, figs. 1, 2).—The anterior ends of the palatine\r\nbones are bifurcated, the inner part being the smaller. The two bones\r\nmake but a narrow angle with the median line, instead of a wide one, as\r\nin _bidens_, and the surface of the maxillæ between them is strongly\r\nconvex instead of flat. This convexity is narrowed at both ends, or, in\r\nother words, is fusiform in shape. No similar conformation is found in\r\n_bidens_, in which the inferior basal area of the maxillæ is flat.\r\n\r\nIn the young Atlantic City skull of _europæus_, the vomer is visible as a\r\nsmall, narrow, club-shaped piece, 68 mm. long. Anteriorly it joins the\r\npremaxillæ, which form a prominent ridge in the median line. On each side\r\nof this ridge is a wide and quite deep groove. As the beak is lacking in\r\nthe adult North Long Branch skull, its peculiarities can not be made\r\nknown. In the type-skull the form is the same as in the Atlantic City\r\nskull, but the vomer does not appear at all on the palate. In _bidens_\r\nthe shape of the inferior surface of the premaxillæ at the distal end is\r\nquite different. A very narrow groove runs parallel with and close to the\r\nmedian line and the whole surface external to it is more or less convex.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe mandible of the Atlantic City specimen of _M. europæus_ resembles\r\nthat of the type, as figured by Van Beneden and Gervais, in the shortness\r\nof the symphysis and in the position of the tooth, which is in advance of\r\nthe posterior end of the symphysis. A number of differences, however,\r\nrequire consideration. (Pl. 11, figs. 3 and 6.)\r\n\r\nIn the type, the symphysis, as shown by Van Beneden and Gervais’ figure,\r\nplate 24, fig. 2_a_, is a little more than one-fifth the length of the\r\nmandible. The same relative proportion is found in the Atlantic City\r\nspecimen, but, as the latter is a younger individual, one would expect\r\nthe symphysis to be shorter. The figure of Van Beneden and Gervais gives\r\nthe impression that in the type the end of the mandible is broken, and\r\nthat, hence, the symphysis is shorter than it was originally. It will be\r\nobserved that figures 2 and 2_a_ do not agree as regards the length\r\nbetween the tooth and the end of the jaw, figure 2_a_ showing a greater\r\nlength. In figure 2, however, the jaw seems rather too long for the\r\ncranium, and if the greater length of the symphysis shown in figure 2_a_\r\nwere introduced, it would certainly be so. The explanation of this\r\ndiscrepancy is not readily found; but one may be allowed to think that\r\nthe symphysis is not so blunt in the type as is shown in figure 2.\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic City specimen the superior lateral free margin of the\r\nsymphysis is straight, while in the type it is much elevated. This is no\r\ndoubt due to difference in age and possibly in sex. The type shows three\r\nor four mental foramina, while the Atlantic City specimen has one large\r\nposterior one and seven smaller ones anterior to it.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of the latter specimen is that the coronoid process\r\nis situated much in advance of the condyle, while the angle extends\r\nconsiderably behind it. In the type both are nearly in line with the\r\ncondyle. I am unable to explain this difference.\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic City specimen the axis of the tooth where it emerges from\r\nthe alveolus is 91 mm. from the end of the jaw. The portion of the tooth\r\nabove the alveolus is 11 mm. long at the base and 12 mm. high. It is\r\nconical and sharp pointed, and is inclined forward and a little outward,\r\nespecially at the tip. At the alveolus the transverse breadth of the\r\ntooth is 5 mm. The much larger tooth in the type indicates that that\r\nspecimen was a male.\r\n\r\nThe mandible of the Atlantic City specimen of _M. europæus_ differs from\r\nthat of _M. bidens_ in the relative shortness of the symphysis, the large\r\nnumber of mental foramina, the more anterior position of the tooth, and\r\nthe direction of the crown, which is forward instead of backward.\r\n\r\n _Dimensions of the type and two other skulls of Mesoplodon europæus._\r\n\r\n  Column headings:\r\n    A: English Channel, type,[a] adult.\r\n    B: North Long Branch, New Jersey, female, adult.\r\n    C: Atlantic City, New Jersey, 23346 U.S.N.M., male, young.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Measurements.

The formula for _europæus_ would then\r\nbe: C. 7, Th. 10, L. 10, Ca. 20 = 47. (Pl. 13, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic City specimen all the epiphyses are free. The atlas and\r\naxis are anchylosed together, the third cervical is united to the axis by\r\nthe centrum, and on the right side by the top of the neural arch; on the\r\nleft side the arch is imperfect and free. The fourth to the seventh\r\ncervicals, inclusive, are all free. The arch is incomplete above in the\r\nfourth, fifth, and sixth, but complete in the seventh. There is a short\r\nneural spine on both sixth and seventh cervicals. The atlas has a broad,\r\nobliquely-truncated inferior lateral process, but no superior process,\r\nwhile the axis has both inferior and superior processes. The inferior\r\nprocess is twice as long as the superior process, and both are directed\r\nbackward. They do not meet to form a ring. The third to the sixth\r\ncervicals, inclusive, have inferior processes only, that on the third\r\nbeing long and thin (but developed on the left side only). On the fourth\r\nand fifth cervicals the processes are short and small; on the sixth, long\r\nand broad, and directed downward. The centrum of the seventh cervical has\r\na broad facet on the side, where the first rib is attached, and an\r\ninferior lateral process thicker than that of the sixth cervical, but\r\nalso directed downward.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the foregoing characters of the cervical vertebræ\r\nare of any systematic importance, as there is a very large amount of\r\nindividual variation among these animals in the development of the\r\ntransverse processes and other details of structure. _M. bidens_,\r\nhowever, appears to have superior transverse processes on most of the\r\ncervicals which sometimes unite with the inferior processes to form\r\nforamina. In the specimen of _M. europæus_ under consideration there are\r\nno superior processes, except on the axis.\r\n\r\nMetapophyses are first distinguishable on the diapophyses of the fourth\r\nthoracic vertebra, and on the seventh assume the form of conical\r\ntubercles. On the eighth and following vertebræ they are flat, and are\r\nlast distinguishable on the seventh caudal vertebra. Facets for the\r\narticulation of the tubercles of the ribs occur on the diapophyses of the\r\nfirst to the seventh thoracic vertebræ. On the latter vertebra the first\r\ntransverse process appears as a short projection on the side of the\r\ncentrum. On the eighth thoracic vertebra, the transverse process is broad\r\nand flat, with the anterior margin bent upward, and is about 48 mm. long.\r\nThe base of the neural arch is strongly concave externally. The\r\ntransverse process of the ninth thoracic vertebra is similar to the\r\npreceding one, but broader and not bent upward anteriorly. The base of\r\nthe neural arch is also concave in this vertebra. The ends of the\r\ntransverse processes of the eighth and ninth vertebræ are emarginate for\r\nthe articulation of the ribs. A median inferior ridge is first\r\ndistinguishable on the seventh thoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\nAs far as can be learned from the descriptions of Turner, Grieg, and\r\nothers, the thoracic vertebræ of _europæus_ do not present any marked\r\ndifferences from those of _bidens_.\r\n\r\nThe transverse processes of the lumbar vertebræ are short, broad, and\r\nflat, and somewhat curved forward. They are expanded and rounded at the\r\nfree ends. The centra increase in length posteriorly, the last lumbar\r\nhaving the greatest length of any vertebra in the column. The neural\r\nspines increase in length from the first lumbar to the fourth, those on\r\nthe remaining lumbars being subequal, but the spine on the ninth lumbar\r\nis a little longer than the others. Median inferior ridges occur on all\r\nthe lumbars and are strongest at the middle of the series. The height of\r\nthe centrum of the ninth lumbar is 63 mm., width 73, and length 116. The\r\nhighest neural spine is 233.\r\n\r\nAs above mentioned, the first of the vertebræ counted among the lumbars\r\nmay be the last thoracic vertebra, but as there is no indication of an\r\narticular facet at the end of the transverse process it is not so\r\nconsidered in this place.\r\n\r\nThe lumbar vertebræ in _M. bidens_ appears to be more nearly equal in\r\nlength than in the present species, but are not different otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe spines of the caudal vertebræ decrease rapidly in height posteriorly,\r\nand disappear after the tenth caudal. The transverse processes resemble\r\nthose of the lumbars, but are shorter. They are last distinguishable on\r\nthe eighth caudal. The transverse process of the seventh caudal is\r\nperforated by a vertical foramen. Similar but much smaller foramina occur\r\non the sides of the centra of the eighth and ninth caudals. In these\r\nvertebræ the inferior ridges are also pierced by foramina. In the fourth\r\ncaudal a ridge appears on the side of the neural arch on a level with the\r\ntop of the centrum, and similar ridges are found on the succeeding\r\nvertebræ as far as the ninth caudal. The last ten vertebræ are without\r\nprocesses or neural arches.\r\n\r\nSir William Turner states that the caudals of _M. bidens_ are without\r\nvertical foramina, but the figure in Van Beneden and Gervais’ Osteography\r\n(plate 22) shows them in the same position as in _M. europæus_. The\r\ninferior ridges, however, appear to be imperforate in the former species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RIBS.\r\n\r\nThe first seven pairs of ribs have both tubercle and head. The first is\r\nnearly as long as the second, and is very broad at the proximal end. In\r\nthe seventh pair the head is double, one facet of the rib articulating\r\nwith the facet on the posterior margin of the centrum of the sixth\r\nthoracic vertebra and the other with the short transverse process on the\r\nside of the centrum of the seventh thoracic vertebra. The eighth and\r\nninth pairs of ribs articulate only with the transverse processes of the\r\neighth and ninth thoracic vertebræ, respectively. The ninth pair of ribs,\r\nas already stated, is nearly or quite as long as the eighth, from which\r\nit seems probable that a tenth short pair was present originally. There\r\nis, however, no trace of a facet for the articulation of such a rib on\r\nthe end of the transverse process of what appears to be the first lumbar\r\nvertebra.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the ribs of _M. europæus_ and those of _M.\r\nbidens_ appears to be that the first pair is much longer proportionately\r\nin the former species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                STERNUM.\r\n\r\nThe sternum presents no differences of importance from that of _M.\r\nbidens_ figured by Grieg,[24] except that the fourth and fifth segments\r\nare anchylosed together, both laterally and transversely, and that the\r\ntwo sides are symmetrical. (Pl. 13, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PECTORAL LIMB.\r\n\r\nThe scapula of _M. europæus_ presents an entirely different appearance\r\nfrom that of _M. bidens_ as figured in Van Beneden and Gervais’\r\nOsteography (plate 22). In _europæus_ the scapula is very high\r\nanteriorly, the anterior border is convex forward and the anterior crest\r\nconvex backward, bounding an elongated elliptical area. The posterior\r\nmargin is straight. The acromion is short, with convex margins at the\r\nbase, beyond which it narrows suddenly and terminates in a straight,\r\ncylindrical process, which is strongly inclined upward. The coracoid is\r\nas long as the acromion, nearly straight and horizontal, but expanded at\r\nthe end. (Pl. 13, figs. 3, 4.)\r\n\r\nThe phalangeal formula of the Atlantic City specimen of _M. europæus_ and\r\nthose of three Norwegian specimens of _M. bidens_ are as follows (the\r\nmetacarpals being included):\r\n\r\n            _Phalangeal formula of M. europæus and bidens._\r\n\r\n                                      I.

The shaft of the ulna is straight. Except in these\r\nparticulars and the relatively small size of the whole pectoral limb, the\r\nlatter appears not to differ materially from that of _M. bidens_. As\r\nshown above, the first digit in _M. bidens_ consists of the metacarpal\r\nbone only, while in _M. europæus_ a phalange is also present.\r\n\r\n    _Dimensions of the skeleton of the Atlantic City specimen of M.\r\n                     europæus, No. 23846, U.S.N.M._\r\n\r\n                                                           mm.\r\n  Length of the seven cervical vertebræ[a]                  94\r\n  Length of first, second, and third cervical               45\r\n  vertebræ[a]\r\n  Atlas:\r\n     Greatest breadth                                      156\r\n     Greatest height                                       103\r\n     Height of neural canal                                 36\r\n     Greatest breadth across anterior articular             96\r\n  facets\r\n  Axis, greatest breadth                                   144\r\n  Seventh cervical vertebra:\r\n     Greatest breadth                                       80\r\n     Greatest height without inferior process              117\r\n     Greatest length of centrum                             14\r\n     Greatest height of neural canal                        49\r\n  First thoracic vertebra:\r\n     Greatest height                                       151\r\n     Greatest breadth                                      136\r\n     Height of centrum                                      37\r\n     Length of centrum                                      21\r\n     Breadth of centrum (articular surface)                 48\r\n     Height of neural spine                                 61\r\n     Height of neural canal                                 53\r\n  Seventh thoracic vertebra:\r\n     Greatest height                                       246\r\n     Greatest breadth                                      116\r\n     Height of centrum                                      35\r\n     Length of centrum                                      69\r\n     Breadth of centrum                                     46\r\n     Breadth between transverse processes                   66\r\n  Eighth thoracic vertebra:\r\n     Greatest height                                       246\r\n     Greatest breadth (between transverse processes)       142\r\n     Height of centrum                                      39\r\n     Length of centrum                                      73\r\n     Breadth of centrum                                     47\r\n  First lumbar vertebra:\r\n     Greatest height                                       263\r\n     Greatest breadth (between transverse processes)       215\r\n     Height of centrum (anterior)                           43\r\n     Length of centrum                                      83\r\n     Breadth of centrum                                     53\r\n  First caudal vertebra:\r\n     Greatest height                                       263\r\n     Greatest breadth (between transverse processes)       207\r\n     Height of centrum (anterior)                           65\r\n     Length of centrum                                     113\r\n     Breadth of centrum                                     67\r\n  Seventh caudal vertebra:\r\n     Greatest height                                       153\r\n     Greatest breadth                                       87\r\n     Height of centrum (without hypapophysis)               66\r\n     Length of centrum                                      84\r\n     Breadth of centrum                                     70\r\n  Length of last 10 caudal vertebræ                        285\r\n  Sternum:\r\n     Total length                                          404\r\n     Length of manubrium                                   165\r\n     Greatest breadth of manubrium                         134\r\n     Depth of anterior notch of manubrium                   37\r\n  Scapula:\r\n     Length                                                247\r\n     Depth                                                 161\r\n     Length of acromion                                  [b]44\r\n     Length of coracoid                                     59\r\n  Humerus, length                                          107\r\n  Radius, length                                           110\r\n  Ulna, length                                             100\r\n  Pelvic bones, length                                      51\r\n\r\n  [a] Placed in contact.\r\n  [b] From the inside, without the cartilaginous tip.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 HISTORY OF THE ATLANTIC CITY SPECIMEN.\r\n\r\nRegarding the finding of the Atlantic City specimen and its exterior and\r\ngross anatomy, nothing has been published except brief references by Sir\r\nWilliam Turner in 1889[25] and Dr. Glover M. Allen in 1906,[26] taken\r\nfrom a newspaper report of a communication made by myself before the\r\nBiological Society of Washington in 1889. On that account a somewhat\r\ndetailed statement regarding it will be made in this place.\r\n\r\nThis individual (Pl. 41, figs. 1, 2) was a male, 12½ feet long. It was\r\nobserved by the crew of life-saving station No. 28, near Atlantic City,\r\nNew Jersey, on the afternoon of March 28, 1889. It had come inside the\r\nbar which skirts the coast at this point, and was apparently unable to\r\nfind its way out. It was captured with some difficulty, after being\r\nwounded in the throat, and was dragged up on the beach near the station.\r\nLater in the day it was carried to the skating rink of Messrs. Johnson &\r\nMcShea, at Atlantic City, where it was exhibited until Monday, April 1.\r\nOn the next morning it was sent by express to Washington.\r\n\r\nI examined it for the first time in Atlantic City on March 29. It was\r\nthen lying on the floor of the skating rink in such a position that the\r\nunder surfaces were concealed, and, as the teeth were not visible, I\r\nmistook it for a female. Upon its arrival in Washington, however, where\r\nit could be examined under more favorable circumstances, it proved to be\r\na male. The following measurements were taken from the fresh specimen:\r\n\r\n _External dimensions of a specimen of M. europæus from Atlantic City,\r\n                              New Jersey._\r\n\r\n                                                          Ft.     in.\r\n  Total length (in a straight line)                       12        6\r\n  Tip of beak to base of dorsal fin (along the back)       7       6½\r\n  Tip of beak to base of pectoral fin (along the back)     2       11\r\n  Length of pectoral fin along center                              11\r\n  Greatest breadth of pectoral fin                                 3¾\r\n  Height of dorsal fin (in a straight line)                         6\r\n  Length of base of dorsal fin                             1        2\r\n  Breadth of flukes (tip to tip)                           2       11\r\n  Depth of tail 14 inches in front of posterior margin             8¼\r\n  of flukes\r\n  Tip of beak to angle of mouth                                    9¾\r\n  Tip of beak to eye                                       1       8¼\r\n  Length of eye                                                     1\r\n  Breadth of blowhole                                               4\r\n  Tip of beak to right angle of blowhole                   1       6½\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EXTERNAL FORM AND COLOR.\r\n\r\nThe general form was slender and elongate. The beak sloped gradually from\r\nits extremity to the forehead, and there was no constriction separating\r\nthe beak from the remainder of the head. Behind the blowhole, the outline\r\nof the back commenced at a higher level, but immediately curved slightly\r\ndownward, indicating the position of the neck. The line then rose\r\ngradually until the anterior base of the dorsal fin was reached. Behind\r\nthe fin the outline sloped downward gradually to the flukes.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal fin was relatively small, falcate, and obtusely terminated.\r\nThe distance in front of its anterior base was three-fifths of the total\r\nlength. Its posterior margin was continuous with the ridge of the back,\r\nwhich extended to the flukes and terminated abruptly a little anterior to\r\nthe middle point of the antero-posterior breadth of the flukes. In front\r\nof the fin the back was rounded.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral fins were small and were placed low down on the sides. Their\r\nanterior base was as far removed from the eye (in a straight line) as the\r\neye was from the extremity of the beak. Their shape was somewhat\r\ndifferent from that of the flippers of _M. bidens_ figured by Sir William\r\nTurner.[27] Their anterior margin was nearly straight throughout; the\r\nextremity was evenly and distinctly rounded off. The posterior margin was\r\nslightly convex in the distal half and straight proximally.\r\n\r\nThe conformation of the region of the axilla was quite peculiar. The hard\r\nintegument of the posterior margin of the flipper was continued\r\nproximally inward and forward to a point near the head of the humerus.\r\nThe triangular area between this stiff edge and the side of the body was\r\noccupied by a thin, soft, wrinkled skin, in the middle of which the\r\nolecranon could be felt. On the side of the body this soft integument\r\noccupied an area nearly as large as the flipper, the underlying thick\r\nlayer of blubber ending abruptly, especially below. A depression was thus\r\nformed in which the flippers could be placed so as to be almost in the\r\nsame general plane with surrounding surfaces of the body. They are\r\nprobably so placed when the animal is swimming.\r\n\r\nThe flukes had the general lunate form common to all species of the\r\norder. The posterior margin is not divided in the center. Its middle\r\nthird was convex; its lateral thirds concave. In these and other respects\r\nthe shape of the flukes agreed closely with Sir William Turner’s\r\nexcellent figure of _M. bidens_.[28] The antero-posterior breadth of the\r\nflukes was, however, somewhat greater in proportion to their transverse\r\nbreadth than is indicated in this figure. The caudal peduncle terminated\r\nabove at a point 6½ inches in front of the posterior margin of the\r\nflukes. On this margin were situated three star-shaped white scars, which\r\nappeared to mark the points of attachment of crustacean parasites.\r\n\r\nThe margins of the upper jaw were very obtuse posteriorly, the rostrum\r\nbeing covered with a layer of blubber of gradually increasing thickness.\r\nA depression bounded by gradually converging lines extended 4¼ inches\r\nback of the angle of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe inferior surface of the bony palate extended below the level of the\r\nlips, and the sides of the former were visible upon looking into the\r\nmouth laterally.\r\n\r\nThe blowhole was large and somewhat unsymmetrically placed, the right\r\nangle being the more anterior. The concavity was forward.\r\n\r\nThe eye was situated a little below the line of the mouth and 20¼ inches\r\nfrom the extremity of the snout.\r\n\r\nThe external opening of the ear was 2⅞ inches behind the posterior angle\r\nof the eye, and a little below the line of the lower eyelid.\r\n\r\nThe two throat-furrows were of unequal length. The left furrow was 6¾\r\ninches long, and its anterior end was distant 8⅝ inches from the\r\nextremity of the jaw. The right furrow did not extend quite so far\r\nforward, and was 7⅜ inches long.\r\n\r\nThe furrows converged posteriorly; they were separated by an interval of\r\n⅝ inches anteriorly and 5⅛ inches posteriorly. Between the anterior ends\r\nof the main furrows was a small one, about an inch long, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether this was a natural fissure. I did not observe it when\r\nthe whale was in Atlantic City.\r\n\r\nThe natural color of the specimen had largely disappeared before I\r\nexamined it, but Captain Gaskell and others who saw it while still fresh\r\nagreed that it was very dark slate-gray on the back, lighter on the\r\nsides, and whitish on the belly. I observed that a broad area between the\r\npectoral fins was slate-gray, and contrasted with the white of the throat\r\nand belly. The whitish color ended somewhat abruptly and irregularly at\r\nthe anus, and the flukes, as well as the pectoral and dorsal fins, were\r\nprobably very dark slate-gray, or blackish, when fresh.\r\n\r\nThe epidermis was exceedingly smooth and glossy throughout.\r\n\r\nThe tongue was purplish-white. The roof of the mouth was black, except at\r\nthe posterior end, where there was an irregular area of pinkish-white.\r\n\r\nThe integument of the roof of the mouth was smooth and shining. Its\r\nsurface was convex at the extremity of the beak, but the central portion\r\nwas concave, while at the posterior end it was again raised into a\r\nrounded pad. In these respects the shape of the integuments coincided\r\nwith that of the underlying maxillæ, upon which they were closely fitted.\r\nThe sides were rounded, and a shallow groove intervened between them and\r\nthe lips. This groove was continued around the roof of the mouth behind,\r\nand formed a demarcation between this part and the œsophagus.\r\n\r\nThe tip of the tongue was 7½ inches from the extremity of the jaw. It was\r\noval in outline, the extremity is obtuse, and it was entirely bound down.\r\nThe margin was entire, and not crenulate, as in many dolphins.\r\n\r\nDorsal and ventral views of the stomach are shown in Pl. 40, figs. 1 and\r\n2; a dorsal view of the lungs in Pl. 13, fig. 5; and of the perineum in\r\nPl. 40, fig. 3.

Brasil,[29] of the Caën Museum. A comparison of the\r\nfigures with those of the Atlantic City and Long Branch skulls on Pls. 2\r\nand 8 of the present article, confirms the identification of the latter\r\nspecimens with _M. europæus_. Besides a brief description of the\r\ntype-skull M. Brasil’s paper contains measurements and two text figures\r\nof the right mandibular tooth, natural size.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MESOPLODON STEJNEGERI True.\r\n\r\n    _Mesoplodon stejnegeri_ True, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., vol. 8, p. 584.\r\n          Oct. 19, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis species was originally described from a single cranium of a young\r\nindividual, which was collected by Dr. L. Stejneger on Bering Island,\r\nCommander Group, Bering Sea, in 1883. With but a single skull, the\r\ncharacters of the species could not be very satisfactorily defined, and\r\nsome European cetologists have been inclined to doubt its validity.[30]\r\nIn 1904, however, another skull was obtained by the National Museum,\r\nwhich made it certain that the species was entirely distinct from _M.\r\nbidens_ or other known forms of the genus. Early in the year mentioned\r\nDr. D. S. Jordan, president of Stanford University, called my attention\r\nto a small whale, which stranded on the coast of Oregon, 1½ miles south\r\nof the United States life-saving station on South Beach, Yaquina Bay,\r\nnear Newport, in February, and proved later to represent the present\r\nspecies. Doctor Jordan’s information was obtained from Mr. J. G.\r\nCrawford, of Albany, Oregon, who wrote him in part as follows, under date\r\nof March 7, 1904:\r\n\r\n  Herewith I enclose a stereograph of a head of a member of the whale\r\n  family, which I made at Yaquina Bay, Oregon. The animal was 17 feet\r\n  long, with fluked tail, soft, smooth skin, blowhole on top of head, and\r\n  two tusks in the mandible, but no [other] teeth in the mouth. The tusks\r\n  are thin and apparently hollow. Length of head, 32 inches; width, 14\r\n  inches; height, 11 inches; blowhole, 5 inches. Eyes low on head. Width\r\n  of mandible [jaw] at end: Upper, 1½ inches; lower, 1¾ inches. Width\r\n  between tusks, 3 inches. The blubber was about 2 inches thick on the\r\n  head. It went ashore about the 15th of February, 1½ miles south of the\r\n  life-saving station on South Beach, 2½ miles south of Newport, Oregon.\r\n  The head had been severed before I arrived.\r\n\r\nA clipping from the _Oregonian_ newspaper contains the following:\r\n\r\n  Albany, Oregon, March 2 [1904]. A peculiar specimen of the whale\r\n  variety has been reported on the Oregon coast, near Newport. J. G.\r\n  Crawford, of Albany, has just returned from a trip to Newport, where he\r\n  made a picture of the head of the strange animal. The body was washed\r\n  upon the beach during the recent storm which swept the coast. It is\r\n  about 15 feet long. * * * Residents of the vicinity say they have never\r\n  seen anything like it on the Oregon coast. * * * On either side of the\r\n  mouth are two villainous-looking tusks several inches in length. They\r\n  are at the back of the mouth, and extend up to a level with the top of\r\n  the upper jaw. They are very wide and flat, squared on top. The mouth\r\n  has no other teeth. * * *\r\n\r\n  The head is equipped with a blowhole, like that of a whale. The eyes\r\n  are very low, almost underneath the lower jaws.\r\n\r\n  The body is in a good state of preservation, the flesh having been torn\r\n  but little by the birds.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the foregoing information, letters were immediately\r\naddressed to Mr. Crawford and also to the keeper of the life-saving\r\nstation at South Beach, Capt. Otto Wellander, asking that, if possible,\r\nthe entire skeleton be preserved. Captain Wellander replied that the\r\nwhale had not been dead long when washed ashore; that he had tried to\r\nfind the body, but that the high tides had either carried it away or\r\nburied it under driftwood.\r\n\r\nThe skull when cleaned passed into the possession of Mr. J. G. Crawford,\r\nwho sent to the Museum some excellent photographs of it, and also of the\r\nhead before the flesh had been removed. Later he sent the skull itself to\r\nthe Museum for my examination, and finally very generously presented it\r\nto the Museum in exchange.\r\n\r\nThe skull is that of an adult individual, in nearly perfect condition,\r\nwith the mandible and teeth. The parts missing are the left malar, the\r\nleft tympanic bone, the distal ends of the pterygoids and the proximal\r\nends of the premaxillæ. (Pl. 3, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SKULL.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon skull exhibits all the characters included in the original\r\ndiagnosis of the species,[31] but two of these, namely, the lack of a\r\ngroove in front of the premaxillary foramen, and the vertical position of\r\nthe premaxillæ distally, I do not at present consider of any importance,\r\nas they are shared by _M. bidens_. The species, as represented by the\r\nOregon skull, however, presents other characters which clearly\r\ndifferentiate it from any other species of the genius. As it is without a\r\nbasirostral groove, it allies itself in that respect to _M. bidens_,\r\n_europæus_, and _hectori_. Unlike those species, it has the premaxillary\r\nforamen behind the maxillary foramen, and in this respect resembles\r\n_densirostris_ and _grayi_. Perhaps the most salient characters in which\r\n_stejnegeri_ differs from _bidens_ and all other known species are the\r\nerect position and flat surface of the supraoccipital and the very\r\nprominent backward extension of the frontal plate of the maxilla. This\r\nbackward extension is so great that when the beak is horizontal a\r\nvertical line through the posterior margin of the maxilla passes\r\nconsiderably behind the temporal fossa. The only species which approaches\r\n_stejnegeri_ in this respect is _hectori_, but in the latter the\r\nsupraoccipital instead of being flat above the condyles is very strongly\r\nconvex.\r\n\r\nAnother very marked character of _stejnegeri_ is that the extension of\r\nthe lateral free margin of the orbital plate of the frontal, anterior to\r\nthe orbit, is equal to the length of the orbit itself. In _bidens_ and\r\nall other known species this extension is only from one-third to one-half\r\nthe length of the orbit. Numerous other distinguishing characters will be\r\nmentioned in the course of the following description of _stejnegeri_,\r\nwhich is drawn from the adult Oregon skull, but modified when necessary\r\nby reference to the type skull from Bering Island. Comparisons are made\r\nchiefly with _M. bidens_, which is on the whole the best known species.\r\n\r\nIn the Oregon skull of _stejnegeri_, the breadth between the post-orbital\r\nprocesses does not exceed the length from the occipital condyles to the\r\nmaxillary notches. The skull is, therefore, narrower in proportion to its\r\nlength than in any other species of the genus except _hectori_, as\r\nrepresented by the skull figured by Flower. This skull was, however, that\r\nof a young individual. It is probable that in adults of this species the\r\nskull is broader than in _stejnegeri_.\r\n\r\nIn the latter species, again, the length of the brain-case, between the\r\noccipital condyles and the maxillary notches, is just equal to the\r\ndistance from the latter point to the distal end of the maxillæ, and the\r\nrostrum, including the premaxillæ, is much shorter than in other species\r\nof _Mesoplodon_, except _hectori_, as represented by the young skull\r\nabove mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe foramen magnum is very small, being less in width than the condyle on\r\neither side of it. In this respect it differs widely from _bidens_ and\r\nother species (as far as can be ascertained from the figures available),\r\nexcept _europæus_, in which the relative size is about the same.\r\n\r\nThe supraoccipital rises vertically above each condyle to the very top of\r\nthe skull, being neither convex nor strongly bent forward as in other\r\nspecies, and especially _bidens_. In the median line, however, while the\r\noccipital bone is flat immediately above the foramen magnum, it is deeply\r\nconcave higher up and without a median ridge. The outline of the\r\noccipital crest, viewed from behind, is semicircular. In all the\r\nforegoing characters the occipital region differs widely from that of\r\n_bidens_ and other species. The only close resemblance is found in the\r\nold skull of _europæus_ from Long Branch, New Jersey, and even here the\r\nsides of the occipital above are far less prominent, their outline is\r\nmuch more convex, the occipital crest is angular, and the median\r\ndepression is less pronounced.\r\n\r\n_Dorsal aspect_ (Pl. 3, figs. 1, 2).—The most noticeable feature of the\r\nupper surface of the skull is the large backward extension of the frontal\r\nplates of the maxillæ, the free margins of which converge strongly. The\r\noutline of the anteorbital region is rounded. The anteorbital notch is a\r\nshallow emargination. Anterior to this is a second still shallower\r\nemargination, the “pseudo-notch.” The margin between the two is much\r\nthickened, but does not form a distinct projection or tubercle, as in\r\n_bidens_ and other species. The superior orifices of the nares are\r\nunsymmetrical as regards position, the left being somewhat in advance of\r\nthe right. The maxillæ are concave around the maxillary foramen, and\r\nexternal to this foramen is an elongated ridge about as in _europæus_.\r\nThe rostral portion of the maxillæ is broad at the base but tapers more\r\nrapidly than in _bidens_. The margin is thick. At the middle of the beak\r\nthe outline of the maxillæ at a lower level is visible from above, which\r\nis not the case in _bidens_ or _europæus_. The rostral portion of the\r\npremaxillæ is oblique proximally and vertical distally. Unlike _bidens_,\r\nthese edges are sharp throughout. The mesethmoid ends opposite the\r\nmaxillary foramina. Anterior to it is seen the concave upper surface of\r\nthe vomer, which, however, becomes flat distally. At about the middle of\r\nthe beak the anterior end is clasped by the posterior forked end of a\r\n“mesirostral” ossification, which has a convex surface. This ossification\r\nbegins proximally below the edges of the premaxillæ, but its surface\r\nrises gradually anteriorly, and at the end of the beak it is much above\r\nthe premaxillæ. The end of the beak consists of the consolidated mass of\r\nthe premaxillæ and mesirostral ossification, the whole being convex above\r\nand below, but flat on the sides. The ossification has a deep median\r\ngroove, which reaches to within 95 mm. of the tip of the beak.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the conformation of the upper surface of the beak is\r\nquite different from that of _bidens_ or any other species.\r\n\r\nThe maxillary foramina are large and directed forward, and have a\r\ndistinct broad channel in front of them. In the Oregon skull the right\r\nforamen is single, but the left divided into two. The premaxillary\r\nforamina are a little behind the maxillary foramina. The distance between\r\nthe maxillary foramina is less than that from the median line to the\r\nanteorbital notch. In _bidens_ it is much greater.\r\n\r\n_Lateral aspect_ (Pl. 9, figs. 1, 2).—A most noteworthy feature of the\r\nskull when viewed from the side is the great length between the orbit and\r\nthe maxillary notch, which far exceeds that found in _bidens_ and other\r\nspecies, being equal to the length of the orbit itself. The latter is\r\nabout as long as the temporal fossa, which is somewhat flattened above,\r\nas in _europæus_. The outline of the supraoccipital is straight and\r\nnearly vertical. The zygomatic is more massive even than _europæus_ and\r\nis especially thick below. The inferior outline of the beak is convex\r\nproximally as in _europæus_ and _layardi_. There is no basirostral\r\ngroove, the edges of the maxillæ being very thick in front of the\r\nmaxillary notch. Over the orbit the maxillæ are thick and beveled, but\r\nnot raised as in _bowdoini_.\r\n\r\n_Ventral aspect_ (Pl. 6, figs. 1, 2).—The beak is convex in the proximal\r\nhalf, much as in _europæus_, but farther forward is concave, except in\r\nthe median line, where there is a narrow ridge formed proximally by the\r\nvomer, which in the type skull appears as a narrow lozenge 60 mm. long.\r\nIn the adult Oregon skull it is anchylosed with the premaxillæ. The\r\nmaxillæ extend to within 107 mm. of the end of the beak. The under\r\nsurface of the beak is much more like that of _europæus_ than of\r\n_bidens_.\r\n\r\nA narrow strip of the palatines extends around the base of the pterygoids\r\nin front, but the two strips do not meet in the median line. In the\r\ntype-skull they do not extend inside the pterygoids. The expanded\r\nanterior end of the malar is very long and also forms the bottom of the\r\nmaxillary notch, which is the case in _europæus_ but not in _bidens_. The\r\ninferior borders of the pterygoids are convex anteriorly, as in\r\n_europæus_, and are continued laterally, so that the sinus is deep as in\r\nthat species. The lachrymal is very long, the free margin having a length\r\nof 55 mm. The posterior margin of the zygomatic process is concave,\r\nrather than convex as in _bidens_.\r\n\r\nThe tympanic bulla does not differ materially from that of _bidens_ in\r\nsize or shape, as far as can be judged from the figures given in Van\r\nBeneden and Gervais’ Osteography (plate 26, figs. 4, 4_a_). The periotic\r\nis similar in size to the same bone in _bidens_, but the posterior end is\r\nmore narrowly pointed and the anterior end is much lower, relatively. In\r\n_europæus_, as far as can be determined from the material at hand, the\r\nform and size of the earbone is similar to that of _stejnegeri_, but in\r\nthe latter the anterior margin of the tympanic bulla is more nearly\r\ntransverse and the posterior inferior groove is curved. (Pl. 35, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nIn the Annisquam skull, supposed to represent _densirostris_, although\r\nfrom a young individual, the earbone is very much larger, especially the\r\nperiotic, which is also quite differently shaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe mandible of _stejnegeri_ is much broken in the region of the angle on\r\nboth sides, but otherwise complete. As compared with a mandible of an\r\nadult _bidens_, the most conspicuous differences are the shortness of the\r\nsymphysis, the sharp upward bend of the inferior margin anteriorly, and\r\nthe large size of the alveolus. The symphysis in the adult Oregon\r\nspecimen of _stejnegeri_ is 140 mm. long, or scarcely more than in the\r\nyoung specimen of _europæus_ from New Jersey, and exactly the same as in\r\nthe adult type-specimen of the latter species, as figured by Van Beneden\r\nand Gervais. The alveolus lies entirely behind the symphysis, its\r\nanterior end being 160 mm. from the anterior end of the jaw. It is 113\r\nmm. long and 18 mm. wide. The mandible is 62 mm. high at its middle\r\npoint. The coronoid process is more anteriorly situated than in _bidens_\r\nand the portion of the posterior margin of the ramus which remains\r\nindicates that the angle was strongly directed backward. (Pl. 11, fig. 4;\r\npl. 12, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are remarkable for their size and form. They are somewhat more\r\nthan twice as broad as teeth of adult males of _bidens_, as shown by the\r\nfigures of Lankester[32] and Grieg,[33] and also a little longer. They\r\nare, in fact, probably broader than, or at least as broad as, the teeth\r\nof any other species of _Mesoplodon_, not excepting _layardi_. Sir\r\nWilliam Turner remarks regarding a specimen of _layardi_ examined by him\r\nthat “the breadth of the tooth, where it emerged from the alveolus, was\r\n3½ inches.”[34] He does not state, however, whether the measurement was\r\ntaken along the top of the alveolus, at an angle with the transverse axis\r\nof the tooth, or along the transverse axis itself. At all events, the\r\nteeth figured by Owen and others are much less than 3½ inches broad. The\r\nteeth of adult _europæus_ are only 2 inches broad, and of _bidens_, as\r\nalready stated, 1½ inches broad.\r\n\r\nIn _stejnegeri_ (Pl. 12, figs. 1-3) the portion of the tooth above the\r\nalveolus is inclined slightly inward and backward, but the pointed tip\r\ncurves outward so as to be vertical. When extracted from the alveolus,\r\nthe whole tooth is found to be concave internally and convex externally.\r\nThe posterior margin is convex and the anterior sinuous, a slight\r\nconvexity occurring on the portion which projects above the alveolus. In\r\nthis place the outer coating of cement is broken through, showing the\r\nunderlying dentine or osteo-dentine, which is somewhat corroded or\r\nabsorbed. This is particularly noticeable on the left tooth.\r\n\r\nThe upper margin of the tooth is transverse, or nearly at right angles\r\nwith the anterior and posterior margins. The posterior angle is rounded\r\nand the anterior raised into an acute point by the projection of the\r\ndentine as a distinct, sharp cusp.

The superior margin of the lower jaw, which is concave in front of\r\nthe tooth, is strongly convex and elevated at the side of it and behind\r\nit. The inferior margin of the upper jaw is straight anteriorly, but\r\nfarther back appears to be pressed upward by the tooth. An examination of\r\nthe skull shows that the mandible can be lowered so that the teeth are\r\nbelow the upper jaw, but when so lowered the space between the teeth and\r\nthe upper jaw on each side is barely a quarter of an inch (6 mm.). With\r\nthe integuments in place, it is doubtful whether the mouth could be\r\nopened any wider than is shown in the photograph. The convexity of the\r\nhead, shape of the blowhole, position of the eye, etc., do not appear to\r\ndiffer materially from the same characters in adults of _M. bidens_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Genus ZIPHIUS Cuvier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ZIPHIUS CAVIROSTRIS Cuvier.\r\n\r\n    _Ziphius cavirostris_ Cuvier, Oss. foss., 2d ed., vol. 5, 1823, p. 353.\r\n    _Hyperoödon gervaisii_ Duvernoy, Ann.

Mus., vol. 6, 1883,\r\n          p. 77.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has not seemed to me necessary in the present connection to attempt to\r\ncite all the multitudinous names which have been given to this species,\r\nespecially as those zoologists most competent to judge, including Van\r\nBeneden, Flower, and Turner, after detailed consideration, have concluded\r\nthat but one species of _Ziphius_, or at most two species, exist at\r\npresent.[35]\r\n\r\nNearly all the skulls in European museums are assigned by the zoologists\r\nmentioned to _Z. cavirostris_ proper, but some doubt has been entertained\r\nregarding two or three European skulls, and one specimen from Argentina,\r\ndescribed by Burmeister. These last-mentioned specimens have been thought\r\nto possibly represent a second species, _Z. gervaisii_. The principal\r\ncharacters of the latter are the narrow, flat premaxillæ, the lack of a\r\nprominent mesirostral ossification, and small teeth. From the large\r\nseries of skulls in the National Museum, I am able to dispose of the\r\ndoubt concerning _Z. gervaisii_. I find that wherever the characters\r\nabove mentioned occur the sex (when known) is female. There is every\r\nreason, therefore, to believe that _Z. gervaisii_ is the female of _Z.\r\ncavirostris_.[36] I will return to this point again later.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Cope described a species from Charleston, South Carolina, under\r\nthe name of _Hyperoödon semijunctus_. In 1886 I referred it to the genus\r\n_Ziphius_, but was in doubt as to its specific identity. I thought that\r\nit might represent _Z. gervaisii_, which is interesting in the present\r\nconnection because the type-specimen was a female.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Dr. L. Stejneger described a species which he had discovered on\r\nBering Island, Bering Sea, under the name of _Z. grebnitzkii_. Through\r\nthe instrumentality of Doctor Stejneger and Governor Grebnitzki, the\r\nNational Museum later received a large series of skulls from the same\r\nlocality. The question of whether this species is identical with _Z.\r\ncavirostris_, or distinct, has caused me much study, and forms the\r\nprincipal subject of this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe National Museum has at present the following material, which may be\r\nconsidered as certainly representing _Z. cavirostris_:\r\n\r\n1. A complete skeleton and cast of an adult female, 19 feet 4 inches\r\nlong, obtained at Barnegat City, New Jersey, October 3, 1883. Cat. No.\r\n20971.\r\n\r\n2. A complete skeleton and photographs of an adult male, 20 feet 1 inch\r\nlong, obtained at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1901, through Dr. E. A.\r\nMearns, Mr. L. di Z. Mearns, and Capt. Gus Soderman. Cat. No. 49599.\r\n\r\n3. The collection contains also the skeleton of the young female\r\nindividual obtained at Charleston, South Carolina, prior to 1865, which\r\nconstitutes the type of _Hyperoödon semijunctus_ Cope. It was originally\r\nin the Charleston College Museum, but later was received by the National\r\nMuseum in exchange. This individual was between 12 and 13 feet long. Cat.\r\nNo. 21975.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the national collections contain the following material,\r\nknown to, or supposed to, represent the species _Z. grebnitzkii_:\r\n\r\n4. Cat. No. 20993.

Photograph of the skeleton of an individual washed\r\nashore at St. Simon Island, Georgia, in 1893, and belonging to Mr. W.\r\nArnold.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Ziphius_, as in other ziphioid genera, a study of the\r\ncharacters of the skull appears to afford the best basis for\r\ndiscrimination of species. We have first to consider whether the North\r\nAmerican species is the same as the European and New Zealand species, and\r\nafterwards whether the North Pacific species is identical with or\r\ndistinct from these.\r\n\r\nThe published measurements of specimens from the coasts of Europe and New\r\nZealand, currently believed to represent the single species _Z.\r\ncavirostris_, are rather meager, and, furthermore, prove, on examination,\r\nto present so little uniformity that they are of limited use for\r\ncomparison with measurements of skulls from the Atlantic coast of the\r\nUnited States. About all that can be said is that the latter skulls are\r\nof about the same size as the former and that the proportions do not\r\npresent any striking differences. For detailed measurements of the\r\nAmerican skulls, see page 53.\r\n\r\nOn account of the uncertainty as regards the measurements, I have had\r\nrecourse to the published descriptions and figures, especially those of\r\nVan Beneden, Sir William Turner, and Doctor Haast. So far as I can\r\nperceive, there is nothing in these descriptions that is not applicable\r\nto the skulls Nos. 49599 and 20971, from Newport, Rhode Island, and\r\nBarnegat City, New Jersey, respectively, in the National Museum, and I\r\ncan find no reason for regarding the latter other than as representatives\r\nof _Z. cavirostris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n            HISTORY OF THE NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND, SPECIMEN.\r\n\r\nOf the Newport specimen, No. 49599, the Museum has the complete skeleton,\r\ntogether with external measurements and a photograph. From data at hand\r\nit appears that the animal was originally obtained in Narragansett Bay\r\nabout October 30, 1901, and afterwards towed to Fort Adams, near Newport.\r\nA few days later it was sent adrift again and stranded in the harbor of\r\nDutch Island, near Canonicut Island, which is opposite Newport. While at\r\nFort Adams its existence was made known to the Museum by Dr. E. A.\r\nMearns, U. S. Army, and his son, Louis Mearns; and a preparator was sent\r\nto obtain the skeleton. With the aid of Captain Soderman, of the\r\ngovernment tug _Monroe_, he found it at Dutch Island, and reported that\r\nit was a male, 20 feet 1 inch in length, measured along the curves of the\r\nback (18 feet 6 inches in a straight line). The epidermis was nearly all\r\nlacking, but the back appeared to have been black. The length in a\r\nstraight line, as reported by Mr. Louis Mearns, was 19 feet. The complete\r\nmeasurements taken by the preparator, Mr. J. W. Scollick, are as follows:\r\n\r\n   _External dimensions of Ziphius cavirostris, male, Cat.

The\r\ncast, which was painted from a sketch made at Barnegat City and from\r\npieces of skin brought to Washington, bears out this note in general, but\r\nwith modifications. The color of the body as a whole is gray tinged with\r\ndull yellowish. The gray is darker on the back than on the belly, but on\r\nthe latter is a large area of dark brown, reaching from near the pectoral\r\nfins to and beyond the anus, and halfway up on the sides. On this dark\r\narea are several large oval whitish blotches, some two inches in\r\ndiameter. Both upper and lower jaws nearly to the angle of the mouth are\r\ncream white. On the sides and belly the gray color is speckled with black\r\nspots of about the size of a grain of wheat. The pectoral fins are dark\r\ngray above and below; the flukes were similarly colored.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the dimensions of the two specimens above described with\r\nthose of European and New Zealand specimens is afforded by the following\r\ntable (the measurements being reduced to percentages of the total\r\nlength):\r\n\r\n_External dimensions of Ziphius cavirostris.

The external measurement originally taken by\r\n          Scollick is entirely too large.\r\n  [k] The skull gives this measurement as 10.4 per cent. The original\r\n          measurement by Scollick is entirely too large and can not be\r\n          correct. The same is probably true regarding length to\r\n          blowhole, but I can not prove it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe close correspondence in proportions shown in this table favors the\r\nidea of specific identity, and taken with the similarity in size, and\r\ncharacters of the skull, warrants, I think, the assumption that the\r\nspecimens from the Atlantic coast of the United States belong to _Z.\r\ncavirostris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COLORATION.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked, however, that the Barnegat City specimen does not\r\nagree in color with any of the European or New Zealand specimens. On the\r\nother hand, the latter show a most extraordinary diversity in color, some\r\nbeing black, with the head and back as far as the dorsal fin white;\r\nothers all black above, white below, and the head black and brown. The\r\ncolor of the young specimen from Buenos Ayres, Argentina, is described by\r\nBurmeister as follows:\r\n\r\n  All the body of the animal is of a light gray color, a little\r\n  yellowish, resembling the color of light ash, but much darker on the\r\n  back and much lighter on the belly. The fins are much darker than the\r\n  back—almost black—and the large fin of the tail has a very pure white\r\n  area of irregular shape on the underside.\r\n\r\nIf the indications from the skull and proportions are trustworthy _Z.\r\ncavirostris_ must be a species in which the color is very variable,\r\ndiffering perhaps in the two sexes, or with differences in age. This is,\r\nhowever, by no means certain at present, and whether the diversities of\r\ncolor reported in different specimens are merely individual variations,\r\nor are due to post-mortem changes, remains to be discovered. It will be\r\nnoticed that the color of the Argentine specimen is nearest to that of\r\nthe Barnegat City specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TYPE OF ZIPHIUS SEMIJUNCTUS (COPE).\r\n\r\nThe type-specimen of _Ziphius semijunctus_ (Cope), as already mentioned,\r\nis a young female.[38] The most noticeable characters which it presents\r\nare that the premaxillæ are flat proximally, and that the teeth are\r\nsmall, sharp-pointed and open at the roots. The form of the teeth is\r\nundoubtedly due to immaturity, but as the shape of the premaxillæ is\r\nsimilar to that found in the nominal species _gervaisii_, it might be\r\nthought necessary to refer _semijunctus_ to the latter species. As will\r\nbe shown later, however, this form of the premaxillæ appears to be\r\ncharacteristic of the adult female of _cavirostris_, and of immature\r\nindividuals of either sex, the young, as in many kinds of animals,\r\nresembling the adult female rather than the male.\r\n\r\nI have been able to find but one character in the skull of _semijunctus_\r\nwhich might be regarded as specific. This is that the lachrymal bone is\r\nthick distally, and cut off square at the end. In other specimens of\r\n_Ziphius_ examined it is thin and flat, and rounded or pointed at the\r\nend. As there is much individual variation in the form of the lachrymal,\r\nthis peculiarity alone is, in my opinion, an insufficient indication of\r\nthe validity of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COMPARISON OF SKELETONS.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the skeletons of the three individuals from the Atlantic\r\ncoast of the United States reveals a number of differences of more or\r\nless importance. Were it not for the lack of reliable differences in the\r\nskulls, it might be considered that these variations in other parts of\r\nthe skeletons indicated specific difference. I am disposed, however,\r\nsince the Barnegat and Newport specimens are of opposite sexes, to regard\r\nthem partly as sexual and partly as individual. In the case of the\r\nCharleston specimen (_semijunctus_), the skeleton, besides being\r\nimmature, has been very much damaged by careless handling, and nearly all\r\nthe bones are somewhat abraded. It is, therefore, only available to a\r\nlimited extent for purposes of comparison. As no description of a\r\n_Ziphius_ skeleton from the coast of the United States has, so far as I\r\nam aware, been published hitherto, and as descriptions of skeletons of\r\nOld World specimens are few and rather brief, I shall give below a\r\ndetailed comparative description of the American specimens. For the sake\r\nof brevity, I shall refer to each specimen merely by the locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VERTEBRAL COLUMN AS A WHOLE.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral formula in the three North American specimens and in four\r\nOld World specimens and Burmeister’s Argentine specimen is as follows:\r\n\r\n              _Vertebral formula of Ziphius cavirostris._\r\n\r\n  Locality and sex.

If such be not the case, this specimen had more\r\nvertebræ than any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CHARACTERS OF THE VERTEBRÆ.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—The seventh cervical vertebra presents a conical\r\nmetapophysis, which on the first thoracic vertebra forms of a rather\r\nthick, long, declining process ending in a facet for the tubercle of the\r\nfirst rib. This metapophysis maintains nearly the same form as far as the\r\nsixth thoracic vertebra, but on the third thoracic a mammiliform process\r\nmakes its appearance on the anterior margin near the tip, and becomes\r\nmore prominent on each succeeding vertebra. On the seventh thoracic it\r\nbecomes larger, thin, and upright, and widely separated from the\r\narticular facet for the tubercle of the rib. On the centrum of this\r\nvertebra lower down is a second much larger rugose articular facet. On\r\nthe eighth thoracic vertebra the upper articular process disappears\r\naltogether and is replaced by a transverse process on a lower level, with\r\na facet at the free end for the rib. On the ninth thoracic the transverse\r\nprocesses are larger and nearly straight. They are longer on the first\r\nlumbar and incline a little forward. Those of the succeeding vertebræ are\r\nsimilar, but decrease gradually in length, while somewhat increasing in\r\nbreadth. They are last traceable on the ninth caudal. On the eighth\r\ncaudal they are perforated by a foramen.\r\n\r\nAll the vertebræ from the first cervical backward have neural spines as\r\nfar as and including the eleventh caudal. The spine on the first thoracic\r\nis rather short, narrow and pointed. These spines increase in height in\r\nsucceeding vertebræ as far as the sixth lumbar; at the same time the\r\nbreadth increases antero-posteriorly and the tip becomes expanded. The\r\nspines are nearly equally high on all the succeeding lumbars, but begin\r\nto decrease on the caudals and disappear altogether on the eleventh\r\ncaudal.\r\n\r\nThe anterior zygapophyses and metapophyses maintain a nearly constant\r\nposition close to the top of the centra throughout the column, from the\r\nseventh thoracic backward, and are vertical, thin, and oblong, squared or\r\nrounded. They begin to decrease in size noticeably on the first caudal,\r\nand on the seventh caudal are mere swellings at the sides of the nearly\r\nhorizontal plate from which the neural spine springs. They are traceable\r\nas far as the twelfth caudal.\r\n\r\nA ridge appears on the side of the neural arch near its base on the fifth\r\ncaudal and is stronger and very marked on those following, to the ninth\r\ncaudal. A ridge unites the anterior and posterior facets for the chevrons\r\non the ninth and succeeding caudals.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—Unlike the Newport skeleton, there are no\r\nneural spines on the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervicals. The spine on\r\nthe first thoracic vertebra is quite short and sharp, and on the second,\r\nthird, and fourth thoracics also is rather pointed, though of increased\r\nlength. There is no metapophysis on the seventh cervical.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh thoracic the facet for the tubercle of the rib, instead of\r\nbeing very prominent, becomes inconspicuous. The metapophysis is flat and\r\nsquared, and there is no lower facet on the side of the centrum. On the\r\neighth thoracic the metapophysis is thin, squared, and vertical, and a\r\nwell-formed transverse process appears on the side of the centrum. The\r\ntransverse processes of the ninth thoracic are a little curved backward,\r\nand on the first lumbar and succeeding vertebræ bent forward. These\r\nprocesses are less tapering on all the lumbars than in the Newport\r\nskeleton. They disappear on the eighth caudal. None is perforated.\r\n\r\nThe longest neural spine is on the sixth lumbar, and on all the lumbars\r\nboth the anterior and posterior edges are somewhat convex. Hence their\r\nshape is rather different from those of the Newport skeleton, in which\r\nthe anterior margins are somewhat concave. The tips of the spines are\r\nrather suddenly expanded. The spines of the caudals are rather more\r\nexpanded at the tip and more inclined backward than in the Newport\r\nskeleton. They disappear on the eleventh caudal.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal plate joining the metapophyses is noticeable on the fifth\r\ncaudal. The ridge on the side of the neural arch is first noticeable on\r\nthe fourth caudal and is very strong on the fifth, sixth, and seventh.\r\nThe metapophyses are last traceable on the twelfth caudal.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—This skeleton resembles the Newport one as\r\nregards the facets for the articulation of the tubercles of the ribs,\r\nexcept that the seventh thoracic resembles the sixth and has no lower\r\nfacet on the side of the centrum. The transverse processes of the ninth\r\nthoracic are rather strongly curved backward, while those on the last\r\nthoracic and first lumbar are nearly straight. On succeeding vertebræ\r\nthey are inclined forward. They are last traceable on the eighth or ninth\r\ncaudal (vertebra 35 or 36). None is perforated by a foramen.\r\n\r\nThough the vertebræ are defective, there appear to have been no neural\r\nspines on the fourth to the seventh cervicals, inclusive. The spine on\r\nthe first thoracic is short, and on the first to the fourth is pointed.\r\nThe spine disappears on the tenth caudal (vertebra 37).\r\n\r\nThe metapophyses assume the vertical position on the eighth thoracic. The\r\nlast of these processes is barely traceable on the tenth caudal (vertebra\r\n37). The ridge on the side of the neural arch is well marked on the fifth\r\nto the ninth caudals, inclusive. On the seventh caudal (vertebra 34) the\r\nanterior and posterior facets for the chevrons are united on the right\r\nside, and on the eighth caudal and succeeding vertebræ on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CERVICAL VERTEBRÆ.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—The first four cervicals are united. The\r\nforamen above the anterior articular facets of the atlas is complete, and\r\nthe edges of these facets are raised. The inferior lateral process is\r\nflat, broad, and strongly bent backward.\r\n\r\nSecond cervical: Inferior lateral process nearly as long as that of the\r\nfirst cervical; broad, flat, and bent backward parallel with the process\r\nof the first cervical. Superior lateral process short, strong, and flat.\r\nA large incomplete foramen between it and the inferior process.\r\n\r\nThird cervical: A short, conical inferior process, curved forward.\r\n\r\nFourth cervical: Similar, but with smaller and shorter inferior process.\r\nNeural arch and spine complete; the latter fused with the preceding\r\nspines. Arch not reducing the size of the neural canal.\r\n\r\nFifth cervical: Arch and spine broken. Arch nearly as broad as the\r\nanterior epiphysis of the centrum. Inferior lateral process short,\r\nstraight, and directed obliquely outward.\r\n\r\nSixth cervical: Spine broken. Arch complete, nearly as wide as the\r\nanterior epiphysis. Inferior lateral process short, thick, knobbed, and\r\ndirected obliquely outward and a very little forward. The left longer.\r\n\r\nSeventh cervical: Spine obsolete. Arch complete, as wide as the anterior\r\nepiphysis. No superior lateral process or metapophysis. A thick articular\r\nfacet for the head of the first rib on the middle of the side of the\r\ncentrum. No inferior lateral process.\r\n\r\nFused spines of the first to fourth cervicals bent backward; the mass\r\nbroad antero-posteriorly and rounded at the tip.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—First cervical with the foramen over the anterior\r\narticular facets incomplete, and the borders of the facets less raised.\r\nThe facets also broader and more declined. Inferior lateral process\r\nthicker, somewhat tapering, and nearly transverse.\r\n\r\nSecond cervical: Inferior lateral process much shorter than that of first\r\ncervical, about parallel with it, but with the tip bent forward. Superior\r\nlateral process short, thick, and bent backward; joined to the inferior\r\nprocess on the right side, inclosing an oval foramen.\r\n\r\nThird cervical: A short, straight, triangular superior process on the\r\nright side; that on the left short and blunt. Inferior lateral process\r\nlong, thick, club-shaped, and curved backward.\r\n\r\nFourth cervical: Inferior lateral process similar to the last in shape,\r\nbut shorter, broad and flat, and only slightly curved backward. Neural\r\narch and spine separate from those of the third cervical; the arch rather\r\nsmaller than those preceding it, and reducing the size of the neural\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nFused spines of the first to third cervicals nearly vertical, rather\r\nhigh, and obtusely pointed.\r\n\r\nFifth cervical: Spine pointed and quite long. Arch complete. Inferior\r\nlateral process short, squared, flattened, and directed outward\r\nobliquely.\r\n\r\nSixth cervical: Spine about as long as on the fifth cervical. Arch much\r\nnarrower than the anterior epiphysis. Inferior lateral process prominent,\r\nthick, somewhat compressed, and directed downward.\r\n\r\nSeventh cervical: Spine as high as the arch, obtusely pointed. Arch\r\ncomplete, as wide as the anterior epiphysis. A strong conical superior\r\nlateral process, or metapophysis, on a broad base, directed forward. An\r\narticular raised facet on the side of the centrum, directed obliquely\r\nbackward. No inferior lateral process.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—The first to fourth cervicals resemble those\r\nof the Newport skeleton, but the fourth entirely separate. All the\r\nlateral processes undeveloped, or broken off, except the right inferior\r\nlateral process of the atlas, which is like that of the Newport specimen.\r\nThe anterior foramen of the atlas is incomplete, as in that specimen, and\r\nthe spines of the conjoined vertebræ are vertical and pointed. (Pl. 25,\r\nfig. 1.)\r\n\r\nFifth cervical: Spine wanting. Arch complete. Inferior lateral process\r\nundeveloped, or abraded.\r\n\r\nSixth cervical: Spine and processes broken. Arch wide.\r\n\r\nSeventh cervical: Similar to that of the Newport skeleton, but the spine\r\nobsolete or broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THORACIC VERTEBRÆ.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—First thoracic: Spine vertical, pointed, about\r\nas high as arch and centrum together. A moderately long process with\r\narticular facet for tubercle of rib on side of neural arch; facet\r\nelliptical and directed a little downward and forward. A smaller facet\r\nfor head of second rib on posterior upper edge of centrum.\r\n\r\nSeventh thoracic: Metapophyses long, extending horizontally, straight\r\nsuperiorly. A small articular facet on the outer side near the base,\r\ndirected downward; strongest on right side. A very small facet on\r\nposterior upper edge of centrum, scarcely noticeable on right side.\r\nNeural spine rather narrow at tip; superior margin straight.\r\n\r\nEighth thoracic: Metapophyses squared and thin. A distinct transverse\r\nprocess on side of centrum about half as broad as the centrum is long,\r\nand as long as centrum is broad; flattened, squared, and a little curved\r\nbackward and upward. Articular facet for rib elliptical and directed\r\nobliquely backward. A broad, shallow groove across base of transverse\r\nprocess, the anterior edge of which is emarginate proximally. Neural\r\nspine as in seventh thoracic.\r\n\r\nNinth thoracic: Metapophyses squared. Transverse process similar to that\r\nof eighth thoracic, but equal to centrum in length, little narrowed at\r\nbase, and directed outward; anterior edge convex, posterior concave;\r\narticular facet occupying the posterior half of the distal edge. A very\r\nshallow groove proximally.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—First thoracic: Neural spine a little curved backward\r\nand rounded at tip; much higher than length of arch and centrum together.\r\nArticular facets as in Barnegat skeleton.\r\n\r\nSeventh thoracic: Metapophyses similar in shape to those of Barnegat\r\nskeleton but with a very distinct facet on side of arch, terminating a\r\nprocess about as long as the greatest diameter of the facet; surface of\r\nfacet rugose. Below this process, on side of centrum, a very large, oval,\r\nsessile facet, reaching forward nearly to the anterior face of the\r\ncentrum and upward to its superior edge. A very low, small swelling on\r\nthe posterior superior edge of centrum, probably indicating the point of\r\nattachment of a cartilage connecting the head of the eighth rib. Neural\r\nspine expanded at free end, and superior margin rounded.\r\n\r\nEighth thoracic: Metapophyses similar to those of Barnegat skeleton. A\r\ndistinct transverse process nearly as broad as the length of the centrum,\r\noblong or squared, flat, directed somewhat backward, but not upward.\r\nArticular facet for rib not occupying whole of free end and only slightly\r\ndirected backward; anterior margin as in Barnegat skeleton. Neural spine\r\nsimilar to that of seventh thoracic.\r\n\r\nNinth thoracic: Similar to that of Barnegat skeleton, but transverse\r\nprocess longer than centrum and directed a little downward, articular\r\nfacet occupying less than posterior half of free margin; proximal groove\r\ninconspicuous; anterior and posterior margins nearly straight.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—The centra of the thoracic, as well as the\r\nlumbar, vertebræ in this individual present inferior median keels, and\r\nmore or less concave sides, which is not the case in the Barnegat and\r\nNewport skeletons. This can not be due to immaturity, as in a still\r\nyounger individual, supposed to represent _Ziphius grebnitzkii_, the\r\nthoracic vertebræ are rounded below. The neural spines of the thoracic\r\nvertebræ are much less inclined backward in _semijunctus_ than in the\r\nNewport and Barnegat skeletons, but this is doubtless connected with age,\r\nas the younger series of vertebræ already mentioned exhibits the\r\npeculiarity in a more marked degree. A similar modification dependent\r\nupon age appears to affect _Hyperöodon_, as will be seen by comparing Van\r\nBeneden and Gervais’ figures in the Osteography, plate 18.\r\n\r\nFirst thoracic: Similar to that of Newport skeleton, but spine not higher\r\nthan arch alone. (A little abraded at tip, but probably undeveloped.)\r\n\r\nSeventh thoracic: Metapophyses short (abraded), incompletely developed. A\r\ndistinct facet on side of same on an elongated process, as in Newport\r\nskeleton, but no second larger one on side of centrum. No facet on\r\nsuperior margin of centrum either anteriorly or posteriorly.\r\n\r\nEighth thoracic: Transverse process similar to that of Barnegat skeleton,\r\nbut anterior edge nearly straight; process about one-half as broad as\r\nlength of centrum. (Indications of immaturity.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LUMBAR VERTEBRÆ.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—First lumbar: Similar to last thoracic, but\r\ntransverse process expanded distally and slightly directed forward; a\r\nlittle longer than centrum; anterior and posterior edges emarginate\r\nproximally.\r\n\r\nEleventh lumbar (last): Centrum very long. Neural arch and spine very\r\nhigh, more than twice length of centrum. Spine inclined backward much\r\nbeyond posterior face of centrum; anterior margin straight, posterior\r\nconvex, tip expanded. Transverse process a little more than one-half\r\nlength of centrum, somewhat expanded at distal end and curved forward so\r\nthat tip is about in line with anterior face of centrum. Metapophyses\r\nclose to centrum and to each other, semihexagonal in outline. A sharp\r\nmedian inferior ridge, and shallow posterior oblique channels on under\r\nside of centrum.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—First lumbar: Similar to that of Barnegat skeleton, but\r\ntransverse processes considerably longer than the centrum and not\r\nexpanded at tip; anterior edge straight, posterior only slightly\r\nemarginate proximally.\r\n\r\nTenth lumbar (last): Centrum like that in Barnegat skeleton. Neural arch\r\nand spine only slightly higher than length of centrum. Transverse process\r\noblong, free margin nearly transverse; process inclined forward so that\r\ntip is a little beyond anterior face of centrum. Metapophyses close to\r\ncentrum, rounded in outline. Neural spine much inclined backward;\r\nanterior edge concave, posterior convex, tip expanded. A rounded inferior\r\nmedian ridge and very distinct oblique posterior channels on under side\r\nof centrum.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—First lumbar: Similar to that of Barnegat\r\nskeleton, but transverse process directed outward and scarcely or not at\r\nall forward; length of process equal to that of centrum; tip rounded (due\r\nto immaturity).\r\n\r\nTenth lumbar (last): Centrum very long. Neural arch and spine a little\r\nless in height than length of centrum. Transverse process oblong, curved\r\nforward, more than one-half as long as centrum. Metapophyses similar to\r\nthose of Newport skeleton. Inferior median ridge very sharp; lateral\r\nchannels rather indistinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CAUDAL VERTEBRÆ.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—First caudal (vert. 28): Similar to last\r\nlumbar, but neural spine broader antero-posteriorly. Transverse process ࡪ\r\nlength of centrum, inversely triangular, the tip much in advance of\r\nanterior face of centrum, free end somewhat rounded. Metapophyses similar\r\nto those of last lumbar. No median inferior ridge, but two short\r\nprocesses bearing facets for chevrons posteriorly and a very slight\r\nindication of similar process anteriorly, but without facets. Posterior\r\ninferior oblique channels indistinct.\r\n\r\nSeventh caudal (vert. 34): Centrum (exclusive of chevron processes)\r\nnearly as deep as long. Neural arch and spine only a little higher than\r\nlength of centrum, very much inclined backward and expanded at distal\r\nend; free border of spine straight. Metapophyses close to centrum, united\r\nnearly to tips by a horizontal plate. A ridge extends backward from their\r\ntips nearly across the arch. Another very prominent ridge traverses the\r\ncentrum at the base of the arch. At the posterior end, a deep groove,\r\nconvex forward, extends down the side of the centrum, making an\r\nemargination in the transverse process and proceeding thence down the\r\nlower side of centrum to its lower middle point, where it ends in a deep\r\nsemicircular emargination between the anterior and posterior chevron\r\nfacets. Transverse process a triangular stub, reaching nearly to the line\r\nof the anterior face of centrum. Chevron processes very large, and the\r\nmedian inferior surface of the centrum between them deeply grooved\r\nlongitudinally.\r\n\r\nTenth caudal (vert. 37): Centrum as deep as long. Neural spine a low\r\nridge, as long as the centrum, and extending beyond it posteriorly. No\r\ntransverse processes. A foramen in side of centrum much above the middle\r\nand a similar one below. Close to the latter and below it another foramen\r\npierces the ridge uniting the chevron processes, and appears below on\r\nside of longitudinal inferior median channel. Metapophyses small\r\nmammilliform processes on top of centrum.\r\n\r\nEleventh caudal (vert. 38): No processes. A very small neural spine.\r\nPosterior epiphysis strongly convex.\r\n\r\nTwelfth caudal (vert. 39): A rounded mass without processes.\r\n\r\nThirteenth caudal (vert. 40): An oblong mass, with two grooves on each\r\nside, two widely separate foramina above and two closely approximated\r\nbelow, entering a common depression, with rounded projections on its\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nFourteenth caudal (vert. 41): Similar to thirteenth caudal, but with a\r\nsingle lateral groove.\r\n\r\nFifteenth caudal (vert. 42): Similar to fourteenth caudal, but sides\r\nextending upward and downward in a ridge. Inferior foramina nearly as far\r\napart as superior and posterior epiphysis much smaller than anterior.\r\n\r\nSixteenth caudal (vert. 43): Similar to fifteenth caudal, but the\r\ndisproportion of epiphyses greater and lateral ridges higher. Superior\r\nand inferior surfaces of centrum inclined.\r\n\r\nSeventeenth caudal (vert. 44): Similar to preceding, but smaller.\r\n\r\nEighteenth caudal (vert. 45): Longer than high. Inferior ridge longer and\r\nlarger than superior. Groove very large. Anterior face of centrum deeply\r\nconcave, posterior flat. Posterior epiphysis very much smaller than\r\nanterior. Foramina very small, practically obliterated on right side.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—First caudal (vert. 27): Similar to last lumbar, but\r\ntransverse process shorter, about two-thirds as long as centrum, oblong\r\nand but little constricted at base; distal margin nearly straight. The\r\nprocess does not extend forward quite to the line of the anterior face of\r\ncentrum. No inferior median ridge, but strong posterior chevron\r\nprocesses. Postero-inferior oblique grooves very distinct.\r\n\r\nSeventh caudal (vert. 33): Similar to the same vertebra in Barnegat\r\nskeleton, but neural spine more inclined backward and anterior border\r\ndeeply concave. Metapophyses oblong, directed upward, not reaching\r\nanterior face of centrum as they do in Barnegat skeleton. Anterior face\r\nof centrum receding superiorly and the ridge opposite it on side of\r\ncentrum shorter than in Barnegat skeleton. Ridge behind metapophyses\r\nindistinct. Postero-inferior oblique grooves as in Barnegat skeleton, but\r\npiercing transverse process, forming a foramen. Anterior and posterior\r\nchevron processes very large and receding very much, as do also the\r\nanterior and posterior faces of centrums.\r\n\r\nEleventh caudal (vert. 37): Similar to Barnegat skeleton, but spine\r\nshorter than centrum and not extending beyond it anteriorly or\r\nposteriorly. Metapophyses similar, but wider apart.\r\n\r\nTwelfth caudal (vert. 38): Neural arch barely complete. No spine.\r\n\r\nThirteenth to nineteenth caudals (vert. 39-45): Similar to those of\r\nBarnegat skeleton.\r\n\r\nTwentieth caudal (vert. 46): Rudely triangular, with a peg-like posterior\r\nprojection, bearing the very small posterior epiphysis. No foramina.\r\nAnterior epiphysis deeply concave in middle.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—First caudal (vert. 28): Similar to last\r\nlumbar, but only a faint inferior median ridge. Inferior outline of\r\ncentrum antero-posteriorly very concave, which is not the case in the\r\nBarnegat and Newport skeletons. Posterior chevron processes prominent.\r\nPostero-inferior oblique grooves shallow.\r\n\r\nSeventh caudal (vert. 34): Like the Newport skeleton. The transverse\r\nprocess not pierced or emarginate. Postero-inferior oblique grooves\r\nindistinct. Ridges on centrum very distinct. Right anterior and posterior\r\nchevron processes united and pierced by a foramen.\r\n\r\nTenth caudal (vert. 37): Similar to the same vertebra in Newport\r\nskeleton, but neural spine very short.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHEVRONS.\r\n\r\nThe number of chevrons in the North American and some other specimens is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Newport, Rhode Island.                               11\r\n  Barnegat City, New Jersey.                       8(+3?)\r\n  Charleston, South Carolina.                          8+\r\n  Buenos Ayres, Argentina (Burmeister).                11\r\n  Holma, Sweden (Malm).                                 9\r\n  Littleton Harbor, New Zealand (Haast).               10\r\n  Warrington, New Zealand (Scott and Parker).           9\r\n  Pisa Museum (Van Beneden).                            9\r\n\r\nThe chevrons are similar in form in the three North American specimens,\r\nwith some differences which will be pointed out below.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—The first chevron consists of a pair of bones which are\r\nnot united. They are longer than deep, their depth indeed being less than\r\nthat of any one of the succeeding bones except the tenth and eleventh.\r\nEach presents one strong superior articulating facet. Second chevron,\r\nelongated antero-posteriorly, but not much deeper than the first. Third\r\nchevron very deep and only equaled in that respect by the fourth;\r\nnarrowed and rounded off below. Fourth chevron largest and broadest\r\n(antero-posteriorly) of the series; expanded below and the lower border\r\ntransverse. Fifth to eighth similar in form, but less deep successively,\r\nand the lower border more rounded. Ninth similar to eighth, but smaller\r\nand thinner. Tenth similar to first, longer (antero-posteriorly) than\r\ndeep. Eleventh similar to tenth in form, but smaller.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—First chevron bone lacking. Second like that of\r\nNewport skeleton, but smaller. Third similar to second, but much larger\r\nand more produced posteriorly; quite unlike the third in the Newport\r\nskeleton in form, and much less deep. Fourth, largest and deepest of the\r\nseries; anterior and posterior borders rounded, and the inferior border\r\nsimilar. Fifth to eighth similar in form, but successively less deep, and\r\nall more expanded below; inferior border nearly straight. Ninth similar\r\nto eighth, but depth not exceeding breadth; lower angles produced.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—The chevrons of this specimen resemble those\r\nof the Newport skeleton, but on account of immaturity they are all more\r\nor less rounded. The two sides of the first chevron are united. The\r\nsecond is without the posterior angular projection seen in the other\r\nspecimens. The third is the deepest of the series. The eighth is not\r\ndeeper than long, and hence resembles the tenth chevron of the Newport\r\nskeleton in proportion, but is, of course, much smaller. Two or three\r\nchevrons are lacking from the posterior end of the series.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RIBS.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—First rib shortest and broadest, but\r\nconsiderably broader at proximal end than at distal end. Head and\r\ntubercle close together. The succeeding ribs increase in length and\r\ndecrease in breadth to the fifth or sixth. The third, fourth, and fifth\r\nare expanded and flattened at distal end. Seventh, eighth, and ninth\r\nsuccessively shorter. Distance between head and tubercle greater on\r\nsecond rib than on first, and on third is greater than on second. On the\r\nthird to sixth, inclusive, the distance is about equal. The tubercle is\r\nscarcely distinguishable on the seventh rib, while on the eighth and\r\nninth it is lacking, these ribs joining the transverse processes by a\r\nterminal facet only.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—Similar to those of the Barnegat skeleton, but first\r\nrib maintains nearly the same breadth throughout. Neck thicker than in\r\nBarnegat skeleton. Seventh rib terminates proximally in a single large\r\nrugose facet, which connects with a similar facet on side of centrum of\r\nseventh thoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—Similar to those of the Barnegat skeleton,\r\nbut a distinct tubercle on the seventh rib. Eighth and ninth ribs end\r\nproximally in a transverse facet only, which is largest on the eighth.\r\nTenth rib (represented by a fragment) only half as broad as the preceding\r\nones and more nearly round in section.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                STERNUM.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—Five segments. Manubrium wider than long,\r\nconvex inferiorly. Deep anterior and posterior notches, about equal, the\r\nformer with an angular projection on each side. Facet for cartilaginous\r\nsternal rib thick and prominent. Second segment wider than long, about\r\nequally notched anteriorly and posteriorly, the two sides anchylosed\r\ntogether by a bony bridge, about as wide as the notches are deep. Third\r\nand fourth segments similar to second but smaller; similarly notched;\r\nleft portion a little longer than right. Fifth segment elongated, left\r\nside very much so; the two sides joined by a narrow bridge; posterior\r\nnotch very deep.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—Similar to sternum of Barnegat skeleton, but manubrium\r\nscarcely wider than long; posterior notch much longer than anterior, with\r\nparallel sides. Second and third segments similar to those of Barnegat\r\nskeleton but sides of latter not completely anchylosed together. Fourth\r\nsegment in two pieces, with a wide interval between. Fifth segment\r\ntriangular with deep anterior, triangular notch, a narrow bridge, and\r\nshort posterior prolongation (the left longer than the right).\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—Resembles the sternum of the Barnegat\r\nskeleton rather than that of Newport skeleton, but anterior parts\r\ncartilaginous. Opposite sides of second, third, and fifth segments\r\nanchylosed together and those of fourth segment nearly so. (Pl. 25, fig.\r\n2).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SCAPULA.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—Superior border irregular. Posterior angle\r\nacute. Anterior and posterior borders nearly straight. Ridges distinct.\r\nAcromion broad both at base and at tip, sharply bent upward, so as to be\r\nparallel with anterior border of scapula. Coracoid nearly as long as\r\nacromion, slender, a little curved upward, irregular and somewhat\r\nexpanded at the end.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—Superior border irregularly rounded. Posterior angle\r\nobtuse, anterior angle projecting. Ridges indistinct. Anterior and\r\nposterior borders nearly straight, but irregular. Acromion broad at base,\r\ntapering toward the tip, which is again somewhat expanded; bent upward,\r\nbut not sufficiently to be parallel with anterior margin of blade.\r\nCoracoid rather thick, irregular, strongly expanded at tip.\r\n\r\n_Charleston_ (female, jr.).—Rather too much abraded for comparisons, but\r\nposterior margin more concave than in either of the other skeletons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FORE LIMB.\r\n\r\n_Barnegat City_ (female).—Fore limb much shorter than in the Newport\r\nskeleton. Humerus: Head quite oblique, the lower edge overhanging the\r\nshaft considerably on the ulnar side. Tuberosity level with upper surface\r\nof head, elliptical in outline when viewed from above. Deltoid ridge\r\nmoderately prominent, irregular, rugose, and extending to about the\r\nmiddle of the shaft. Distal end of humerus not expanded. Bicipital groove\r\ninconspicuous.\r\n\r\nRadius: Almost perfectly straight, but a little inclined toward ulna at\r\noblique proximal end; scarcely expanded at distal end, which is lower\r\nexternally than internally.\r\n\r\nUlna: Much slenderer than radius, rounded triangular in section, not\r\nexpanded at distal end, where the margin is lowest externally. Olecranon\r\nwell developed, thin, and pointed proximally.\r\n\r\nCarpals: Five; two on ulna side, two median and one on radial side in\r\nline with first metacarpal. The proximal middle bone (intermedium)\r\nextends much farther proximally than those on each side of it.\r\n\r\nMetacarpals: Metacarpal III longest, metacarpal II broadest. Metacarpal I\r\noblong, or rather conical, with a lateral enlargement, and situated in\r\nline with the distal row of carpals.\r\n\r\nDigits: First phalange of first digit short and conical.\r\n\r\n_Newport_ (male).—Fore limb considerably longer and more massive than\r\nthat of the Barnegat skeleton but similar otherwise, except as follows:\r\n\r\nHumerus: Head rather larger and less inclined. Deltoid ridge more\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\nRadius: Broader proximally and rounded at distal end, where it extends\r\noutward beyond the carpal bones.\r\n\r\nUlna: Thicker, and olecranon less pointed.\r\n\r\nCarpal bones: Middle carpal bone not extending farther proximally than\r\nthose on either side of it.\r\n\r\nMetacarpals: Metacarpal I nearly square, third longest, second to fourth\r\nmore constricted.\r\n\r\nDigits: First phalange of first digit long and cylindrical. Phalangeal\r\nformula: I, 1; II, 6; III, 6; IV, 4; V, 2.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the skeletons above described are as follows:\r\n\r\n         _Dimensions of four skeletons of Ziphius cavirostris._\r\n\r\n  Column headings:\r\n    A: Barnegat City, New Jersey. 20971 U.S.N.M. female, adult.\r\n    B: Newport, Rhode Island. 49599 U.S.N.M. male, adult.\r\n    C: Charleston, South Carolina. 21975 U.S.N.M. female, young.\r\n    D: Bering Island.

As far as the processes of the cervicals are concerned, these\r\nare known to be extremely variable in all cetaceans. The seventh and\r\neighth thoracic vertebræ are those on which the mode of attachment of the\r\nribs changes in ziphioid whales, and I have observed in the genus\r\n_Mesoplodon,_ as here, that the processes and articular facets were very\r\nvariable, being sometimes quite unlike on the two sides of the same\r\nvertebra. The direction of the acromion is probably subject to large\r\nindividual variations, though this can not be determined at present, and\r\nthe same is true of the form of the first phalange of the first digit.\r\nThe form of the sternum is quite variable in all cetaceans, and can not\r\nbe relied on for specific characters, without comparison of many\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I am of the opinion, as already stated, that we are not\r\ncompelled by the differences noted to regard the Barnegat and Newport\r\nskeletons as representing different species. The Charleston skeleton is\r\ntoo young and imperfect to admit of serious consideration. The idea that\r\nthe differences between the adult skeletons are probably individual\r\nreceives support from the fact that the skeleton shown in the photograph\r\nfrom St. Simon Island, Georgia, mentioned on page 31, No. 14, appears to\r\npossess a combination of characters exhibited by the other two.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AGE VARIATIONS IN SKULLS.\r\n\r\nThe series of skulls of _Z. grebnitzkii_, which the Museum owes to the\r\nactivities of Dr. L. Stejneger and Mr. N. Grebnitzki, comprises specimens\r\nof different ages, and, as will be shown presently, probably both sexes.\r\nTaken together with the skulls from the east coast of the United States\r\nthey probably represent very fully the variations which the skull\r\nundergoes in the present species. These changes may, perhaps, be best\r\nmade evident by the following brief descriptions of the various skulls:\r\n\r\n_21975. Charleston, South Carolina._—Young female. (Type of _Z.\r\nsemijunctus_.) All sutures open, and elements of occipital bone\r\ndistinguishable. No mesethmoid ossification. Opposite maxillary notches,\r\npremaxillæ closely approximated, nearly flat and horizontal, and about\r\nlevel with adjacent parts of maxillæ. Left premaxilla grooved\r\nlongitudinally at this point. Orifice of anterior nares on a level with\r\nlower end of rectangular projecting boss formed by superior portion of\r\nnasals. Rostrum pointed, much broader distally than it is deep. A very\r\ndistinct rudimentary alveolar groove in distal end of each maxilla.\r\nProximal end of vomer resting against anterior face of nasals and\r\nreaching up to overhanging boss. Anterior face of the latter nearly flat.\r\n(Pl. 14, fig. 1; pl. 18, fig. 1; pl. 20, fig. 1; pl. 21, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nRami of mandible not anchylosed together at symphysis. Teeth hollow, open\r\nat the root, acute at apex, tipped with enamel; diameter 10 mm. (Pl. 22,\r\nfig. 1; pl. 24, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n_20971. Barnegat City, New Jersey._—Adult female. Majority of sutures\r\nopen, but those on superior surface of rostrum between maxillæ and\r\npremaxillæ partly anchylosed. Vomer nearly all anchylosed to rostral\r\nportion of premaxillæ; it presents a slight median elevation, but there\r\nis no mesirostral ossification. Right premaxilla in front of nares broad,\r\nflat, and horizontal; left, nearly so, but with a quite broad\r\nlongitudinal groove. Opposite maxillary notches premaxillæ nearly on a\r\nlevel with adjacent parts. Orifice of anterior nares level with lower end\r\nof nasal boss. End of rostrum quite acute, and broader than deep.\r\nRudimentary alveolar groove distinct distally. Proximal end of vomer\r\nanchylosed with anterior face of nasals and reaching up to nasal boss,\r\nwhich has a sharp median ridge completing nasal septum superiorly.\r\nAnterior face of nasal boss slightly concave on each side of median line.\r\n(Pl. 14, fig. 2; pl. 18, fig. 2; pl. 20, fig. 2; pl. 21, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nRami of mandible anchylosed together at symphysis and suture largely\r\nobliterated. Teeth slender, cylindrical, rugose, rather blunt; roots\r\nclosed; diameter 13 mm. (Pl. 24, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\n_22069. Bering Island._—Adult female? All the sutures about as in\r\npreceding specimen. Mesirostral ossification distinct, rounded, extending\r\nfrom base of rostrum nearly to apex, but disappearing before reaching\r\nline of anterior ends of maxillæ. Its upper surface below that of\r\npremaxillæ. Premaxillæ approximated, and right premaxilla with an angular\r\nprocess near base of rostrum overlapping mesirostral ossification.\r\nPremaxillæ at base of rostrum, anterior nares, proximal end of vomer, and\r\nnasals as in preceding skull. Apex of rostrum moderately acute, broader\r\nthan deep. Rudimentary alveolar groove shallow. (Pl. 15, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nRami of mandible anchylosed together and suture largely obliterated.\r\nTeeth somewhat fusiform, blunt; roots closed; diameter, 14 mm. (Pl. 22,\r\nfig. 3.)\r\n\r\n_83991. Bering Island._—Similar in all respects to preceding, but\r\nmesirostral ossification a little less well developed.\r\n\r\n_22874. Bering Island._—Entirely similar to two preceding, but premaxillæ\r\na little curved out from mesirostral ossification and left premaxilla\r\nopposite maxillary notch rather strongly inclined, nearly vertical.\r\nAnterior face of nasal boss distinctly concave. (Skull defective.)\r\n\r\n_21246. Bering Island._—Sutures as in three preceding skulls. Mesirostral\r\nossification distinct and rounded, but much below level of premaxillæ.\r\nRostral portion of premaxillæ narrow and widely divergent toward base of\r\nrostrum, leaving mesirostral entirely exposed. Right premaxilla on a line\r\nwith maxillary notches strongly concave and sunk below level of maxillæ.\r\nLeft premaxilla vertical, with a broad groove. Right premaxilla remains\r\nlow and concave proximally, the posterior end being then abruptly turned\r\nupward and reaching level of vertex. Orifice of anterior nares on a level\r\nwith lower end of nasal boss, and vomer resting against anterior face of\r\nnasals, which latter have a median ridge continuing nasal septum, but\r\nwith a slight vacuity between the two. Rudimentary alveolar groove nearly\r\nobliterated. Outer sides of premaxillæ at distal end strongly concave.\r\nRostrum rather acute, about as deep as wide opposite distal ends of\r\nmaxillæ. (Pl. 15, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n_20993. Bering Island._—Adult male? (Type of _Z. grebnitzkii_). Majority\r\nof sutures open, but maxillæ and premaxillæ anchylosed together above and\r\non the sides. Premaxillæ approximated anteriorly, but diverging\r\nposteriorly. Mesirostral ossification well developed, reaching level of\r\npremaxillæ; anteriorly rather narrow but a little broader near middle of\r\nrostrum, where it is beveled off abruptly. Behind this point premaxillæ\r\nstrongly concave, nearly vertical and widely separated, forming a large\r\nand deep basin, in the bottom of which the vomer appears as a broad,\r\nirregular bony surface. Bottom of basin much below level of surrounding\r\nparts. Orifice of anterior nares much below level of nasal boss. Vomer\r\nreaching lower end of nasals. Anterior face of latter strongly concave,\r\nwith only a moderate median ridge completing nasal septum above.\r\nMesirostral with a median groove at distal end. Premaxillæ high at distal\r\nend, but sides nearly plane. Rostrum compressed near apex, deeper than\r\nwide. (Pl. 16, fig. 1; pl. 19, fig. 1; pl. 20, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nRami of mandible anchylosed together and suture partly obliterated. Teeth\r\nconical, with rather short, acute tips; roots closed, short and conical;\r\ndiameter, 25 mm. (Pl. 23, fig. 1; pl. 24, fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n_21245. Bering Island._—Nearly all sutures between maxillæ and premaxillæ\r\nat end of rostrum, above and below, anchylosed together, but majority of\r\nothers traceable. Condition of superior surface of skull very similar to\r\nthat of preceding, but premaxillæ rather low at distal end. Mesirostral\r\nat distal end rather lower than premaxillæ and concave superiorly; more\r\nposteriorly assuming form of a narrow ridge, with a deep channel between\r\nit and premaxillæ on each side. More posteriorly still it widens rapidly,\r\nwith a convex surface, and terminates abruptly with a truncated end, the\r\nsurface of which is concave. A deep basin around nares, as in preceding\r\nskull. Orifice of anterior nares far below level of nasal boss. The\r\nlatter largely absorbed and deeply undercut and concave in front. Nasal\r\nseptum terminating before reaching lower end of nasals, and ridge on\r\nlatter low and traversing left nasal. Sides of premaxillæ at distal end\r\nvery concave. Rudimentary alveolar groove nearly obsolete. Rostrum blunt\r\nat apex, and about as deep as wide at anterior ends of maxillæ. (Pl. 16,\r\nfig. 2.)\r\n\r\n_21248. Bering Island._—Similar to preceding, but mesirostral\r\nossification higher than premaxillæ at distal end and convex above; less\r\nabruptly widened posteriorly and posterior termination flat. Narrow, deep\r\ngrooves between ossification and premaxillæ on each side, or, in other\r\nwords, premaxillæ more closely approximated to sides of mesirostral\r\ndistally. Basin around nares and conformation of the several bones\r\nbordering it similar to preceding. Sides of premaxillæ concave at distal\r\nend, the grooves thus formed in them intruding some what on the maxillæ,\r\nespecially posteriorly. Apex of rostrum very blunt, rounded off below and\r\nprojecting above; deeper than wide. Rudimentary alveolar groove nearly\r\nobsolete. (Pl. 17, fig. 1; pl. 22, fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nRami of mandible anchylosed together and the symphysis and suture largely\r\nobliterated. Teeth very broadly fusiform; tip short and rather blunt;\r\nroots closed; diameter 30 mm.\r\n\r\n_49599. Newport, Rhode Island._—Adult male. All sutures on superior\r\nsurface of skull more or less anchylosed together. Mesirostral\r\nossification and premaxillæ all on one level near apex of rostrum, but at\r\nextreme tip mesirostral lower, forming a narrow ridge with a deep groove\r\non each side between it and premaxillæ. The same conformation repeated\r\nmore posteriorly, but grooves deeper and wider, while mesirostral\r\nmaintains the same level as premaxillæ. It widens suddenly here, forming\r\na broad flat-topped mass, which is a little overlapped by the premaxillæ.\r\nThe mass terminates suddenly somewhat behind middle of rostrum with a\r\ndeep concavity placed obliquely. Basin in front of the nares and\r\nconformation of bones composing it as in two preceding skulls. Vomer at\r\nproximal end touching lower end of nasals, and nasal septum continued\r\nbehind and above it as a low ridge, composed of the inner edges of the\r\ntwo nasal bones and reaching up to the nasal boss. Outer sides of\r\npremaxillæ near distal end deeply concave. Apex of rostrum rather blunt,\r\ndeeper than wide opposite distal ends of maxillæ; all the bones\r\nanchylosed together, but some of the sutures indicated by grooves.\r\nRudimentary alveolar groove nearly obsolete. (Pl. 17, fig. 2; pl. 19,\r\nfig. 2; pl. 21, figs. 1, 5.)\r\n\r\nRami of mandible anchylosed together at symphysis, the suture indicated\r\nonly by a groove. Teeth large, broadly conical and tapering at the tip.\r\nRoot very short, rugose, conical and closed; diameter 29 _mm._ (Pl. 22,\r\nfig. 2; pl. 23, figs. 2, 3.)\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the several skulls are as follows:\r\n\r\n _Dimensions of ten skulls of Ziphius cavirostris (including the types\r\n         of Z. grebnitzkii Stejneger and Z. semijunctus Cope)._\r\n\r\n  Column headings:\r\n    A: 83991.

Is only approximate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SEX CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nIt will be found from an examination of the foregoing descriptions that\r\nin those specimens in which the sex is known to be female, or is marked\r\nas such, the premaxillæ are comparatively narrow, the mesirostral\r\nossification only slightly developed, the prenarial basin undeveloped,\r\nand the teeth quite slender, with a diameter of from 10 to 14 mm. As the\r\nteeth in some of them have closed roots there can be no doubt that they\r\nare adults. On the other hand, those skulls known or believed to be from\r\nadult males have the mesirostral ossification enormously developed, a\r\ndeep prenarial basin, and fusiform teeth with closed roots and a diameter\r\nof from 25 to 30 mm. It appears to be a fact, therefore, that in the\r\nfemales the mesirostral ossification is never greatly developed at any\r\nage, that the teeth are never thick and fusiform, and that the prenarial\r\nregion is never deeply concave. Immature individuals present, of course,\r\nthe appearance of the females, except that the teeth are open at the root\r\nand that the mesirostral ossification is not developed at all.\r\nConversely, the females, broadly speaking, always present characters of\r\nimmaturity, but in adults the roots of the teeth are, of course, closed.\r\n\r\nThat these conclusions are correct is borne out by an examination of\r\ndescriptions and figures of specimens from other parts of the world, for\r\nwhich purpose a few are available in the writings of New Zealand\r\nzoologists and others. Hector, for example, in 1873,[40] published a\r\ndescription and figures of a skull from the Chatham Islands which had a\r\nlarge mesirostral ossification, deep prenarial concavity, and large,\r\nthick teeth, having a diameter of 34 mm. This is the same combination of\r\ncharacters found in the Newport specimen, which is known to be a male,\r\nand the Bering Island skulls supposed to be those of males.[41]\r\n\r\nIn 1876,[42] Haast figured and described a female 26 feet long, and hence\r\npresumably adult, from Lyttleton Harbor, New Zealand, which had a small\r\ndevelopment only of the mesirostral ossification, a slight prenarial\r\ndepression, and rather slender teeth with closed roots and a diameter of\r\n19 mm. This combination of characters is found in the Barnegat skull,\r\nalso known to be an adult female.\r\n\r\nIn the same paper Haast describes[43] and figures the skull of another\r\nfemale from Akaroa Harbor, New Zealand. This individual was larger than\r\nthe last and was accompanied by a suckling calf. Hence, there can be no\r\ndoubt that it was mature. The skull shows a moderate development of the\r\nmesirostral ossification, and slender cylindrical teeth with closed roots\r\nand a diameter of 16 mm.\r\n\r\nIt is demonstrated from the foregoing discussion, I think, that the sexes\r\ncan be distinguished by the skulls, when adult, or by the teeth alone.\r\n\r\nReverting now to _Ziphius gervaisii_, which was mentioned on p. 30 as\r\nperhaps constituting a separate species, it will be seen by examining the\r\nfigures given by Gervais[44] of the skull on which it was based that the\r\nlatter presents the combination of characters peculiar to the female of\r\n_Z. cavirostris_. This skull, which was from Aresquiers (Hérault),\r\nFrance, was 888 mm. long, and hence, presumably, adult. The mesirostral\r\nossification is but slightly developed, the prenarial concavity moderate,\r\nthe teeth small, slender, and cylindrical, with closed roots and a\r\ndiameter of 14 mm. There seems to be no sufficient reason for regarding\r\nthis skull as representing a species distinct from _cavirostris_.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from Buenos Ayres described and figured by Burmeister in\r\n1868[45] was an immature male. In the skull the mesirostral ossification\r\nwas lacking, the premaxillæ were flat, and the teeth conical and\r\nacuminate, with open roots, and a diameter of 12 mm. This individual was\r\n12 feet 11½ inches (3.95 m.) long, and hence about as long as the\r\nCharleston specimen, but the skull was apparently 680 mm. long, while\r\nthat of the Charleston specimen is 797 mm. long. In the latter the teeth\r\nare 45 mm. long and 10 mm. in diameter, while the tooth figured by\r\nBurmeister is 31 mm. long and 12 mm. in diameter. From these data it\r\nappears improbable that the sex of immature individuals can be determined\r\nfrom the skull or teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the various North Atlantic and North Pacific specimens merit\r\na somewhat more detailed description than is given on pages 50 to 53. Six\r\npairs of teeth from six different individuals are available for\r\ncomparison. Their dimensions are as follows:\r\n\r\n           _Dimensions of the teeth of Ziphius cavirostris._\r\n\r\n  Cat.  Locality.                      Age.  Sex.

Charleston, South Carolina._—Young female. (Type of _Z.\r\nsemijunctus_.) The teeth are slender, conical, and acuminate, largest at\r\nthe base and tipped for about 2 mm. with white enamel. The remainder of\r\nthe teeth is coated with a thin layer of cement. The teeth in what\r\nappears to be their natural position protrude horizontally from the\r\nmandible for about 17 mm. They are slightly curved upward near the tip\r\nand are oval, or elliptical, in section, the transverse diameter being a\r\nlittle less than the vertical diameter. They are a little flattened\r\nexternally. The surface is smooth. They are open at the root, and hollow.\r\n(Pl. 38, figs. 1, 2; pl. 22, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nDoctor Manigault, curator of the Charleston Museum, wrote to Professor\r\nCope regarding these teeth, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Another peculiarity of the head consists in the lower maxillary bones\r\n  being provided each at its point with a single small and very sharp\r\n  tooth. These were not noticed during the dissection, owing to their\r\n  being too much embedded in the integuments.[46]\r\n\r\n_20971. Barnegat City, New Jersey._—Adult female. The teeth are slender,\r\ncylindrical, and irregularly pointed at both ends. The tips show what\r\nappears to be an inner core of dentine which has been worn down nearly to\r\nthe cement coating and somewhat fractured. The cement coating is several\r\nmillimeters thick, but does not increase the diameter of the teeth near\r\nthe middle, so that they remain irregularly cylindrical throughout. The\r\nsurface of the cement is rough and irregular. The root is short, conical,\r\nand closed at the end. These teeth are nearly straight. As they have been\r\nextracted from the jaw and the latter is broken it is not possible to\r\ndistinguish which is the upper and which the lower surface, but they are\r\nirregularly oval in section, and a little compressed. (Pl. 38, figs.\r\n3-5.)\r\n\r\nIn my original notes on this specimen, I recorded that there was a small\r\npair of teeth behind the larger ones described above. Mention of these\r\nwill be made again later. (See p. 57.)\r\n\r\n_22069. Bering Island._—Adult female (?). The teeth are in position in\r\nthis specimen and are nearly horizontal in position, but a little\r\ninclined upward and toward each other. They do not extend beyond the tip\r\nof the jaw nor up to the level of the upper surface of the symphysis, but\r\nprotrude about 13 mm. beyond the alveoli on the side. They are rather\r\nslender, somewhat fusiform, blunt at both ends and slightly curved\r\nupward. The surface is irregular. They are nearly round in section. The\r\nroot is closed, and the apex shows what appears to be a core of dentine\r\nsurrounded by cement. There is a depression on the inner side near the\r\nroot. These teeth are remarkable as intermediate in form between those of\r\nthe preceding specimen and those of the specimens next to be mentioned.\r\n(Pl. 38, figs. 6, 7; pl. 22, fig. 3.)\r\n\r\n_20993. Bering Island._—Adult male (?). (Type of _Z. grebnitzkii_.) These\r\nteeth are almond-shaped and very symmetrical. They are thickest near the\r\nbase and taper gradually to the tip, which is quite acute. They are\r\nsomewhat compressed and hence elliptical in section, the vertical\r\ndiameter being greater than the transverse diameter. One side (probably\r\nthe inner) is flattened. They are slightly curved upward toward the apex,\r\nwhich is a little worn and fractured. The root is very short and conical.\r\nIt is nearly closed, but a very small canal extends upward for about 10\r\nmm. The surface of the tooth is quite smooth, but dull in the lower half.\r\nThe line of demarcation between cement and dentine is not evident. (Pl.\r\n38, figs. 8, 9; pl. 23, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n_21248. Bering Island._—Adult male (?). In this specimen the teeth are\r\nstill in the natural position in the jaw. They are held in place by\r\nligaments and protrude far beyond the alveoli, only about one-ninth of\r\ntheir length being below the superior border. They incline forward at an\r\nangle of about 45° with the longitudinal axis of the jaw and diverge\r\nslightly at the tips.\r\n\r\nThe teeth themselves have the same general form as those of the preceding\r\nspecimen, but are larger. The inner surface is flattened and the outer\r\nstrongly convex. The tips are quite pointed, but show some indications of\r\nwear. The roots can not be seen distinctly, but appear to be closed. (Pl.\r\n22, fig. 4.)\r\n\r\n_49599. Newport, Rhode Island._—Adult male. These teeth are longer than\r\nthose of the preceding specimen, and while they resemble the latter in\r\ngeneral form, taper much more gradually to the tip. The root, or portion\r\nbelow the point of maximum girth, is much shorter than that above, and\r\nrugose, with several deep furrows. A very small circular opening at the\r\nbase of the root marks the orifice of the nerve. The upper half of the\r\nteeth is smooth, and the tips slightly worn and fractured. The small\r\nelliptical worn area is situated on the convex side of the tooth, which\r\nappears to be the outer side. As the alveoli of the jaw are, however,\r\nfilled with a network of bone, the teeth can not be inserted in them.\r\nThey were detached when received. (Pl. 38, figs. 10, 11; pl. 22, fig. 2;\r\npl. 23, figs. 2, 3.)\r\n\r\nBesides the difference in the size and form of the teeth in the two\r\nsexes, it is probable, as will be seen by consulting the foregoing data,\r\nthat in the female the apex of the teeth does not extend more than a very\r\nsmall distance above the alveoli even in mature individuals, and probably\r\noften not more than a few millimeters; while in adult males the teeth are\r\nalmost entirely protruded from the alveoli, which are filled with a\r\ncoarse bony network. These differences are carried out in all the\r\nAmerican specimens, and also characterized the New Zealand specimens, as\r\nmay be learned from the accounts of Haast and Hector.\r\n\r\nA number of rudimentary teeth in addition to the large terminal pair have\r\nbeen noted in the Aresquiers, Buenos Ayres, and perhaps other specimens,\r\nand two such teeth were found in the mandible of the Barnegat specimen,\r\nbehind the large pair. One of these rudimentary teeth has been preserved.\r\nIt is cylindrical and moderately curved. The length is 16 mm. and the\r\ndiameter 2 mm. The whole tooth, with the exception of the extreme tip, is\r\nthickly coated with cement. The root is closed and the crown acute and\r\napparently abraded by use. (Pl. 38, fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nReturning now to the question of the validity of _grebnitzkii_ as a\r\nspecies, I would say that after comparing the measurements of the Bering\r\nIsland skulls with those of the Atlantic coast specimens, and comparing\r\nthe skulls themselves, I have been unable to find any constant difference\r\nof importance, except the size and form of the periotic bone. As the\r\nearbones are lacking from many of the skulls, the series available for\r\ncomparison is small.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the Atlantic coast specimens, the anterior portion of\r\nthe periotic bone in _grebnitzkii_ is larger, broader, and more\r\nrectangular in outline when viewed from below. I observe, however, that\r\nthe absolute size and outline of the periotic vary considerably in the\r\ndifferent specimens of _grebnitzkii_ without relation to age. The same\r\nappears to be true of _cavirostris_, but comparing the two series of\r\nskulls as a whole it appears to be true that the anterior mass of the\r\nperiotic is larger in _grebnitzkii_. I do not think, however, that the\r\nlatter species should be kept distinct on this account alone, at least\r\nuntil the character has been confirmed, and perhaps strengthened by\r\nothers, through the examination of a larger series of specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SKELETON OF ZIPHIUS FROM BERING ISLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Museum collection contains an incomplete skeleton of a very young\r\nindividual, Cat. No. 22875, which was received from Bering Island with\r\nthe skulls of _Z. grebnitzkii_, but does not belong to any one of them.\r\nWhether it really represents that species is, therefore, uncertain, but\r\nsuch is probably the case. The length of the vertebral column, consisting\r\nof 45 vertebræ, without interspaces, is 9 feet 2 inches.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral formula is as follows: C. 7; Th. 10; L. 10; Ca. 18 (+1?) =\r\n45 (+1?). This is the same as in the type of _semijunctus_ so far as the\r\ncervicals, thoracics, and lumbars are concerned, and the probable total\r\nis the same. In their general characters these vertebræ agree with those\r\nof the skeletons already described, but they present a number of\r\ndifferences as well. On account of immaturity the processes are even less\r\ndeveloped than in _semijunctus_. All the epiphyses are free, and in the\r\nthird to the seventh thoracic vertebræ the neural arch and spine are\r\nseparate from the centrum. The centra are very short in proportion to\r\ntheir width.\r\n\r\nAlthough the specimen is so young, the anterior foramen of the atlas is,\r\nnevertheless, inclosed by bone, and though the line of separation between\r\nthe atlas and axis is visible on the sides, the fourth cervical is\r\nanchylosed to the third at the top of the centrum. Although the neural\r\nspines, metapophyses, and transverse processes of the thoracics are much\r\nshorter than those of the young _semijunctus_, the epiphyses are as large\r\nor even larger than in that specimen. The neural arches are also\r\nnoticeably thicker than in _semijunctus_, and the centra are rounded\r\ninferiorly rather than carinated. The neural spines are much more nearly\r\nerect than in the adult Barnegat and Newport skeletons, but, as mentioned\r\non page 41, this is probably a character of immaturity, and is shared by\r\n_semijunctus_.\r\n\r\nThe differences as regards the form of the centra and neural arches die\r\naway among the lumbars, and these vertebræ and the caudals are, with a\r\ndue allowance for greater immaturity, very similar to those of\r\n_semijunctus_.\r\n\r\nThe seventh thoracic is like the sixth in form, and is without a\r\ntransverse process. It thus resembles the same vertebra in _semijunctus_.\r\nThe eighth, however, has an ill-defined facet on the side of the\r\nmetapophysis and a second facet a little above the upper border of the\r\ncentrum. The eighth pair of ribs has only a single terminal articular\r\nfacet.\r\n\r\nThe ninth thoracic has a short, thick transverse process, about in line\r\nwith the upper surface of the centrum.\r\n\r\nThe transverse process of the seventh caudal is perforated on the right\r\nside by a foramen. The transverse processes are last traceable on the\r\nninth caudal, the neural spines on the tenth caudal, and the neural arch\r\non the eleventh caudal. Eight chevron bones are preserved, but probably\r\ntwo more were present originally.\r\n\r\nTen pairs of ribs are present. The first is much broader in the proximal\r\nhalf than in the distal half, but the distal end is slightly expanded.\r\nThe first seven pairs possess both head and tubercle, but the eighth,\r\nninth, and tenth have only a single terminal articular facet.\r\n\r\nThe sternum, which consists of five segments, is similar in form to that\r\nof _semijunctus_. The two sides of each segment are united. The posterior\r\nemargination of the third segment, and those of both ends of the fourth\r\nand fifth segments are small. The scapula and humerus are like those of\r\n_semijunctus_ in form. The remaining parts of both pectoral limbs are\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nWithout more material, and especially some skeletons of adults, it is\r\ndifficult to decide what importance should be assigned to the differences\r\nobservable in the cervical and thoracic vertebræ of this young Bering\r\nIsland specimen. The measurements of the skeleton are included in the\r\ntable on pages 47 and 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          EXTERNAL CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nThe series of photographs (Cat. No. 142579) of an individual obtained in\r\nKiska Harbor, Alaska, is very interesting as affording comparison of what\r\nis apparently a specimen of _grebnitzkii_ with the Atlantic form\r\nrepresented in the photograph of the Newport, Rhode Island, specimen. As\r\nno part of the Kiska specimen was preserved, it is not possible, of\r\ncourse, to identify it positively with _grebnitzkii_ or even with the\r\ngenus _Ziphius_. No one who compares the photographs reproduced in Pl.\r\n41, figs. 3 and 4, can, I think, fail to be convinced that both represent\r\nanimals of the same genus and that the Pacific species (whether\r\n_grebnitzkii_ or not) bears the strongest possible resemblance to the\r\nAtlantic one.\r\n\r\nDoctor Egbert published the following note on the Kiska specimen in 1905:\r\n\r\n  Early in September a monster dolphin grounded on the beach in Kiska\r\n  Harbor and was killed. Specific identification has not yet been made.\r\n  The general color was bluish-gray; length, 18½ feet; estimated weight,\r\n  3,600 pounds; sex, male. Body was quite regular in shape and rather\r\n  rotund, the greatest circumference being about midway between dorsal\r\n  fin and tip of the rather short snout. This dolphin was hauled\r\n  alongside the ship, stripped of its blubber, and the oil extracted.\r\n  Some of the flesh was eaten. The oil obtained was of excellent quality.\r\n  It was particularly desired for use on the wire of the deep-sea\r\n  sounding machine used aboard the [U. S. Coast Survey steamer]\r\n  _Patterson_.[47]\r\n\r\nThe size was about the same as that of the Newport specimen. Although\r\nDoctor Egbert gives the color merely as “bluish gray,” the photographs\r\nindicate that the belly was white, or whitish, and that there were oval\r\nwhite spots on the sides. As a whole, therefore, the coloration was\r\nsimilar to that of the New Zealand specimens of _cavirostris_ obtained at\r\nPort Cooper and Lyttleton Harbor.\r\n\r\nWhen compared with the photograph of the Newport specimen (Pl. 41, fig.\r\n4) it will be seen that the Kiska photograph represents an animal\r\npractically identical in general form, as well as in the general shape of\r\nthe head, the length and form of the snout, the size and general shape of\r\nthe pectoral fins. In the photograph of the Newport specimen the flukes\r\nare not well seen, but in the Kiska photograph the posterior median\r\nconvexity peculiar to the ziphioids is clearly represented. The dorsal\r\nfin of the Newport specimen appears to be turned somewhat to one side and\r\nthe tip crumpled, which makes it appear lower and somewhat longer and\r\nless pointed than that of the Kiska specimen. This may, of course, be a\r\nreal difference, though such is probably not the case.\r\n\r\nConsidering the foregoing data relative to _grebnitzkii_ as a whole,\r\nthere is not in my opinion sufficient warrant at present for considering\r\nthis form as a species distinct from _cavirostris_, and it should be\r\nadded that no distinguishing characters were given in the original\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Genus BERARDIUS Duvernoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this genus the National Museum has three skulls and three skeletons\r\nrepresenting the species _bairdii_, and a skull representing the species\r\n_arnuxii_. The latter, Cat. No. 21511, U.S.N.M., is without exact\r\nlocality, but is catalogued as having been obtained in New Zealand. As\r\nthe species _arnuxii_ has been well described and figured by Flower[48]\r\nand others, no detailed account of this skull is given here. Measurements\r\nof it, however, are included with those of _B. bairdii_ in the table on\r\np. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BERARDIUS BAIRDII Stejneger.\r\n\r\n    _Berardius bairdii_ Stejneger, Proc.

Handl., vol. 8,\r\n          1883, No. 4, p. 109.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis species was based by Dr. L. Stejneger on a skull obtained by Mr. N.\r\nGrebnitzki in Stare Gavan, on the eastern shore of Bering Island,\r\nCommander Group, Bering Sea, in the autumn of 1881. In 1879 a portion of\r\na skull of the same species was found on Bering Island by the _Vega_\r\nexpedition, and was made the basis of a new species, _B. vegæ_, by A. W.\r\nMalm, the description of which was published a few months after that of\r\nDoctor Stejneger. The National Museum subsequently received another skull\r\nfrom Bering Island, through Mr. N. Grebnitzki, but, so far as I am aware,\r\nnothing further was heard of the species until 1903 and 1904, when the\r\nNational Museum received three nearly complete skeletons, two of them\r\nfrom St. George Island, Pribilof Group, Bering Sea, and one from the\r\ncoast of California. The material now in the National Museum is as\r\nfollows:[50]\r\n\r\n(1) _Cat. No. 20992_.—Skull and mandible of an immature individual\r\ncollected by Dr. L. Stejneger in Bering Island.

No. 49725_.—Skeleton and two photographs of an adult male (?)\r\nstranded on Centerville beach near Ferndale, Humboldt County, California,\r\nOctober, 1904. Length, about 41 feet.\r\n\r\nA brief note on the St. George Island and California skeletons was\r\npublished by the author in Science for 1904.[51] The dimensions given by\r\nthe collectors were so large as to raise doubts whether they were\r\ncorrect, but the arrival of the skeletons proved that they were not\r\noverstated, and that the specimens were by far the largest ziphioid\r\nwhales ever discovered, the bones about equaling those of a humpback\r\nwhale in size and massiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n              HISTORY OF THE ST. GEORGE ISLAND SPECIMENS.\r\n\r\nThe St. George Island specimens were first made known by Mr. James Judge,\r\nspecial agent of the Treasury Department, resident at the Pribilof\r\nIslands, in a letter dated June 16, 1903, as follows:\r\n\r\n  I was much surprised the other day to find a pair of whales ashore near\r\n  East Rookery [St. George Island]. They lay about 150 yards apart. The\r\n  female was 40 feet 2 inches, the male 25 feet 5 inches in length. The\r\n  species is not positively identified, but tallies closely with the\r\n  Globe Encyclopedia description of Bottlehead or Bottlenose whale,\r\n  _Hyperodoön bidentatus_. Natives call it “Tcha-dhan.” The male is\r\n  without teeth; female has two teeth in front of lower jaw.[52] The skin\r\n  is thin, smooth, white underneath, and black above. Dorsal fin small\r\n  and well aft. Caudal large and powerful. Eyes very small. Ears not\r\n  visible.\r\n\r\n  Thinking that the skeleton might be of use, the bones of the female\r\n  were cut out and placed high and dry on the grass. Four ribs were\r\n  broken; otherwise the bones are intact. The male was towed to East\r\n  Landing, and with the aid of a capstan deposited beyond reach of surf.\r\n  Some blubber was saved. The foxes will clean up the bones during\r\n  August, so that in all probability both skeletons will be available\r\n  this fall. * * * I inclose some measurements, taken roughly, with a\r\n  5-foot tape line.\r\n\r\n                  _Whale measurements, June 11, 1903._\r\n\r\n                                                     Female.

Through a misunderstanding they were allowed to remain\r\non the beach at St. George Island until November, 1903, and suffered\r\nconsiderable injury. On that date they were deposited in a storehouse by\r\nMaj. Ezra W. Clark, assistant treasury agent in charge, who afterwards\r\npresented the photograph of the female above mentioned. (Pl. 42, fig. 1.)\r\nThe latter shows the short, narrow, pointed pectoral fin, and long,\r\nrather slender beak.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of _Berardius_ was found stranded on St. George Island\r\non August 21, 1909. The following information regarding it was received\r\nfrom Maj. Ezra W. Clark, under date of September 4, 1909:\r\n\r\n  On August 21, 1909, after an unusually severe gale for the season,\r\n  accompanied with heavy sea, a beaked whale was stranded under the\r\n  cliffs of the northeast coast of St. George Island. Its position was\r\n  such that it was reached with great difficulty. It was undergoing\r\n  decomposition. I succeeded in getting the following information:\r\n\r\n  Sex, female.\r\n  Length from tip of beak to end of body, 22 feet.\r\n  Length of beak, tip to base, 2 feet 5 inches.\r\n  Length of head, not including beak, 2 feet.\r\n  Length of tail, or width of flukes at base, 1 foot 10 inches.\r\n  Girth around beak at its base, 2 feet.\r\n  Girth around body at dorsal fin, about 12 feet.\r\n  Girth around body at base of tail, 3 feet.\r\n  Spread of tail, or flukes, 6 feet.\r\n  Length of dorsal fin at base, 1 foot 10 inches.\r\n  Fore fins, 1 foot 10 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I think that I shall not be able to get the skeleton of this whale,\r\n  owing to the rough seas prevailing.\r\n\r\n\r\n           HISTORY OF THE CENTERVILLE, CALIFORNIA, SPECIMEN.\r\n\r\nThe Californian specimen (Cat. No. 49725) was first made known in a\r\nletter addressed to me by President Jordan, of Stanford University, under\r\ndate of October 27, 1904, inclosing one from Mr. J. H. Ring, of Ferndale,\r\nCalifornia, dated October 23, 1904, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Enclosed find three views of an animal stranded on the beach near this\r\n  place [Ferndale, Humboldt County, California], and as its identity\r\n  seems rather uncertain we hope you will kindly classify it and inform\r\n  us of its true name and habitat, if possible, from the photographs and\r\n  incomplete description. Its total length is about 41 feet. Greatest\r\n  circumference 16 feet, tapering probably to 18 inches near the tail. It\r\n  also tapers toward the head, terminating in a sharp beak, the upper jaw\r\n  being about 16 and the lower 19 inches long.\r\n\r\n  On each side in the lower jaw well to the front is a conical tooth, the\r\n  crown of which is exposed one-half an inch. The head is full and\r\n  rounded, resembling that of an elephant, with depressions corresponding\r\n  to the ears, and small eyes a little ahead and below.\r\n\r\n  On top of head is a heart-shaped opening, evidently for breathing\r\n  purposes. There is also evidence of a dorsal fin, while each fork of\r\n  tail is 3½ feet or so long. The underside of the animal is too bruised\r\n  to show anything of importance. The flippers are also in bad shape, one\r\n  being buried in the sand, while the other is entirely denuded of flesh,\r\n  leaving a bony stump about 6 inches long and which moves readily in any\r\n  direction. We think it is a “bottle-nose” whale, but as some claim that\r\n  they are not to be found on this coast and do not exceed 30 feet in\r\n  length, it may be something else.\r\n\r\nMr. Ring was immediately communicated with, and very generously presented\r\nto the Museum the skull of the animal, which he had secured and cleaned\r\nwith much labor and some danger to himself. He also undertook to have the\r\nskeleton cleaned and sent to Washington, and it was received in due\r\ncourse in June, 1905. Mr. Ring wrote under date of May 15, 1905:\r\n\r\n  You will notice that the point of the beak, as well as the points of\r\n  the lower jawbones, are a little damaged, some hunters having shot the\r\n  teeth out and then set a fire inside the jaws.\r\n\r\nWhen received, the skeleton lacked the flippers and also two of the\r\nteeth. Regarding the former, Mr. Ring wrote on November 18, 1905, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  I wrote you that one flipper was entirely gone and the other worn down\r\n  to a stump, as shown in the picture. I have interviewed the man who\r\n  stripped the specimen, and he says the stump was badly crushed and\r\n  broken and fears it was lost one night when the extremely high tide had\r\n  turned the whale over, and only the anchors and lashings I had secured\r\n  it with prevented its going out to sea.\r\n\r\nThis skeleton was mounted recently and placed on exhibition in the\r\nMuseum. The flippers were modeled from those of the St. George Island\r\nspecimens (which were also imperfect) and from the figures of _B.\r\narnuxii_ given by Flower. The end of the beak was also restored, and a\r\nfacsimile of the teeth substituted for the real ones. This remarkable\r\nskeleton shows in a manner hitherto unapproached the great size which\r\nthis genus of ziphioid whales attains, and the peculiar conformation of\r\nthe body. While the vertebræ rival those of the large whalebone whales,\r\nsuch as the Humpbacks, in their dimensions, the head is remarkable for\r\nits small size as compared with the immense proportions of the same part\r\nin the Right whales. (Pl. 42, fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nMr. Ring sent to the Museum three photographs of the Californian specimen\r\nabove mentioned, two of which are reproduced on Pl. 42, figs. 2 and 3.\r\nAlthough rather indistinct, they show the general form of the body, the\r\npeculiar bulbous head, with an indication of a neck, and the long beak.\r\n\r\n\r\n             DESCRIPTION OF A YOUNG BERING ISLAND SPECIMEN.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stejneger has very kindly placed in my hands his original notes on\r\nthe young individual examined by him in Bering Island June 5, 1883 (Cat.\r\nNo. 142,188) and they are given below in full:\r\n\r\n  When the news reached me that a small “plavum” was found dead ashore at\r\n  the North Rookery of Bering Island, I immediately ordered dogs, and\r\n  arrived at the place in company with the “starost.” The carcass was\r\n  found lying on the very beach where the fur seals during the summer\r\n  occupy the ground. As the bulk of the seals had not yet arrived, only a\r\n  few “sikatschi” were seen in the immediate neighborhood, but it was\r\n  reported that they had retired from the place on account of the smell\r\n  of the putrefied body, as it was thought. The natives, fearing that it\r\n  would drive the seals from the rookery altogether if left on the beach\r\n  any longer, were very anxious to get it away as fast as possible, and\r\n  it was only with some hesitation that they would allow one to stand on\r\n  the rookery long enough to take a few measurements. The animal was\r\n  quite a young one, and I conjectured that it had died immediately after\r\n  having been born, as I think there were some remains of the umbilical\r\n  cord. Hardly any of the bones were fully ossified. Under these\r\n  circumstances, it was out of the question to have the whole skeleton\r\n  preserved, as the dismembering and the separation of the putrified\r\n  flesh from the bones and cartilages would require more care and\r\n  consequently more time than the natives were willing to allow. I was\r\n  therefore glad to secure the head and some of the neck vertebræ. Even\r\n  that tried their patience, as the head was going to separate into its\r\n  single bones and the not yet united component pieces, and consequently\r\n  needed special care and attention.\r\n\r\n  The carcass was lying with the back upward, this visible part being\r\n  uniform black, and still in such a state as to allow of measuring. The\r\n  lower surface was in a very advanced state of decomposition. Part of\r\n  the belly was torn away, together with the entrails, and the genitalia\r\n  and anus were not to be found. As stated above, I think that I could\r\n  recognize the umbilical cord attached to a tatter of the skin. Of\r\n  course, measurements of the lower side and of the circumference of the\r\n  body, except at the narrowest place of the tail, could not be taken.\r\n\r\n                         _Table of dimensions._\r\n\r\n                                                               Meters.\r\n  Total length from tip of upper jaw to notch of caudal fin,      4.81\r\n    along the middle of the back, without, however, following\r\n    the angle between beak and forehead\r\n  From tip of upper jaw to fore border of spiracles                .53\r\n  From fore border of the spiracles to fore border of dorsal fin  2.63\r\n  Length of dorsal fin                                             .29\r\n  Height of dorsal fin                                             .11\r\n  From hind border of dorsal fin to the beginning of the caudal    .93\r\n    fin\r\n  From the same point to notch of the caudal fin                  1.36\r\n  Distance between the tips of the lobes of the caudal fin         .91\r\n  Depth of the angle of the posterior margin of caudal fin         .20\r\n  From tip of upper jaw to the angle of mouth                      .36\r\n  From the same to anterior angle of eye                          .475\r\n  Diameter of eye opening                                          .06\r\n  From eye to eye over the spiracle                                .59\r\n  Distance between ends of spiracle                                .08\r\n  Length of beak from the forehead                                 .23\r\n  Breadth of the beak at the forehead                              .18\r\n  From tip of upper jaw to anterior insertion of the pectoral      .80\r\n    fin\r\n  Pectoral fin along the anterior border                           .51\r\n  Breadth of pectoral fin[a] at the insertion                      .20\r\n  Circumference of tail at its narrowest point, just before the    .62\r\n    caudal fin\r\n\r\n  [a] The pectoral fin rather straight, of equal breadth, and abruptly\r\n          ending.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION OF BERARDIUS BAIRDII.\r\n\r\nThe original description of _B. bairdii_ by Doctor Stejneger is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Besides an _Orca_, which is said to visit the rookeries, but of which I\r\n  have not been able to procure any specimen, or even to see one, there\r\n  are at least two species of the family _Ziphiidæ_, both undescribed, as\r\n  I suppose. I am very much indebted to Mr. Grebnitzki for a skull of\r\n  each of the species, for one of which I should like to propose the name\r\n  _Berardius bairdii_, as a slight token of my esteem and gratitude.\r\n\r\n  As I am now almost without any literary means, I find it impossible to\r\n  decide with certainty in what genus this species will finally have to\r\n  be placed. But I think that the supposition that this specimen (No.\r\n  1520) is a young _Berardius_ may not be far out of the way. At first I\r\n  suspected that it is a _Dioplodon_, but the size of the skull, in\r\n  connection with the distinctness of the sutures, the evident maxillary\r\n  crests, and the terminal position of the teeth very soon led me to the\r\n  above conclusion.\r\n\r\n  The specimen in question has very low and scarcely incurved maxillary\r\n  crests; the shortest distance of which is two and two-thirds times\r\n  greater than their greatest height, and although it still is in its\r\n  “adolescent” stage, I should greatly doubt whether the crests in this\r\n  species ever become developed to such a degree as, for instance, in\r\n  _Hyperoödon diodon_ (Lacép.). The groove between the maxillary and the\r\n  nuchal crest is very shallow. The maxillary notch is deep. The beak is\r\n  long, making only a little less than half the length of the entire\r\n  skull. Nares straight; right nasal larger than the left one, but not\r\n  very much. The occipital condyles do not come in contact beneath the\r\n  foramen magnum; the symphysis of the lower jaw is very short, amounting\r\n  to only one-fifth of the whole length of the jaw.\r\n\r\n  Want of time and books prevents me from making more extended remarks,\r\n  and until I can present an exhaustive and comparative description, I\r\n  shall have to content myself by giving a provisional table of\r\n  dimensions. The following dimensions are in millimeters and English\r\n  inches, and are in every case measured in a straight line:\r\n\r\n                                                              mm.    in.\r\n    Length of skull                                         1,405  55.32\r\n    Greatest breadth                                          698  27.48\r\n    Greatest height                                           530  20.87\r\n    Length from process of supramaxillaries before orbit      610  24.02\r\n      to posterior edge of condyles\r\n    Length from same process to tip of beak                   890  35.04\r\n    Depth of maxillary notch                                   50   1.97\r\n    Length of premaxillaries                                1,222  48.11\r\n    Premaxillaries reach beyond supramaxillaries              134   5.28\r\n    Distance of upper edge of maxillary crests at their       228   8.98\r\n      anterior end\r\n    Distance of same at their middle                          358  14.10\r\n    Greatest height of maxillary crests                        86   3.39\r\n    Length of visible part of vomer                           325  12.80\r\n    Distance from anterior tip of vomer to tip of beak        275  10.83\r\n    Length of pterygoids                                      295  11.62\r\n    Height of foramen magnum                                   70   2.76\r\n    Width of foramen magnum                                    80   3.15\r\n    Distance of condyles at upper edge of foramen magnum      100   3.94\r\n    Closest approximation of condyles beneath the foramen       2   0.08\r\n      magnum\r\n    Entire length of lower jaw                              1,292  50.88\r\n    Height of lower jaw at second tooth groove                100   3.94\r\n    Length of symphysis                                       257  10.12\r\n    Greatest diameter of foremost tooth groove                100   3.94\r\n      (longitudinal)\r\n    Shortest diameter of foremost tooth groove                 45   1.77\r\n      (transverse)\r\n    Greatest diameter of posterior tooth groove                40   1.58\r\n      (longitudinal)\r\n    Shortest diameter of posterior tooth groove                35   1.38\r\n      (transverse)\r\n    Distance between the tooth grooves                         65   2.56\r\n\r\n  This specimen was found stranded in Stare Gavan, on the eastern shore\r\n  of Bering Island in the fall of last year, and only the skull was\r\n  preserved. From analogy I should judge that the entire length of the\r\n  animal must have been about 18 feet (5½ meters). This species is well\r\n  known by the natives for the cathartic quality of the blubber,\r\n  resembling in this respect the Atlantic “Dögling,” or “Anarnak”\r\n  (_Hyperoödon diodon_). The Russian name, by which the inhabitants here\r\n  designate this whale, is _Pla-un_ (sp. Pläoon), while the Aleut name is\r\n  _Kigan agalusoch_, the meaning of which is said to be “having teeth on\r\n  the nose,” a very inappropriate designation, as the teeth are situated\r\n  on the tip of the lower jaw, and not on the nose.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SIZE.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the largest of the foregoing specimens measured\r\n40 feet 2 inches in length, while the Centerville skeleton was reported\r\nto be about 41 feet long. The largest example of the New Zealand species,\r\n_B. arnuxii_, of which there is a record was 32 feet long.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COLORATION.\r\n\r\nThe St. George Island specimens were reported to be black on the back and\r\nwhite below, but it is not certain how long they had been dead when found\r\nby Mr. Judge. The young individual examined by Doctor Stejneger was also\r\nblack on the back, but this was in a state of decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe color of the type-specimen of _Berardius arnuxii_ was described by\r\nArnoux as follows: “Its color was entirely black, except for a light gray\r\narea near the genital organs; it was a male.”[54] Haast remarks of a\r\nyoung individual observed by him near New Brighton, New Zealand, and not\r\nin a fresh condition: “The color of the whole animal was of a deep,\r\nvelvety black, with the exception of the lower portion of the belly,\r\nwhich had a grayish color.”[55]\r\n\r\nThe color of the immature male of _B. arnuxii_ captured in Wellington\r\nHarbor, New Zealand, in 1877, and described by Hector, was as follows:\r\n“The colour was black with a purple hue, except a narrow band along the\r\nbelly, which was grey. The muzzle, flippers, and tail lobes were\r\nintensely black.”[56]\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that there is any marked difference in the color of\r\n_arnuxii_ and _bairdii_, but the data available are insufficient for the\r\ndetermination of the matter. It will be observed, however, that Mr. Judge\r\nstated that the male _bairdii_ found on St. George Island was white\r\nbelow, while in all the accounts of _arnuxii_ the color of the under\r\nsurface is given as blackish, with a restricted area of gray.\r\n\r\nBesides its apparently greater size, _Berardius bairdii_ differs from _B.\r\narnuxii_ in various cranial and other osteological characters, as well as\r\nin external proportions, and is to be regarded as a distinct species. The\r\nexternal measurements of the St. George Island specimens reduced to\r\npercentages of the total length and compared with similar measurements of\r\na specimen of _B. arnuxii_ described by Hector, are as follows:\r\n\r\n       _External dimensions of Berardius bairdii and B. arnuxii._\r\n\r\n  Column Headings:\r\n    _bairdii._\r\n      A: 49726 St. George Island, Alaska, (Judge), female adult.\r\n      B: 49727 St. George Island, Alaska, (Judge), male imm.\r\n    _arnuxii._\r\n      C: Wellington, New Zealand, (Hector), male.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Measurements.

The\r\nspecimen of _arnuxii_ appears to have had narrower flukes, shorter\r\npectoral fin, and a rather higher dorsal fin, situated farther forward\r\nthan in _bairdii_. Measurements of a larger number of specimens might\r\nshow that some or all of these differences of proportion are elusive, but\r\nit will be observed that in the Wellington specimen of _arnuxii_,\r\nrecorded by Doctor Haast, the breadth of the flukes is only 21 per cent\r\nof the total length. The pectoral fin is said to be only 19 inches long,\r\nor only 5.2 per cent of the total length, but the manner of taking the\r\nmeasurement is not mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs regards size, the largest specimen of _B. arnuxii_ of which I find\r\nrecord is the type specimen. This was 32 feet long, and the skull 1,400\r\nmm., or about 55 inches long. This appears to have been an adult male.\r\nThe Centerville specimen of _bairdii_, which was an adult male, was about\r\n41 feet long, and the skull 1,532 mm., or about 60 inches long, while the\r\nadult female from St. George Island was 40 feet 2 inches long and the\r\nskull 56 inches. Although the total length of the specimens of _bairdii_\r\nis so much greater, it will be observed that the length of the skull,\r\nwhile a little greater, absolutely fails to measure up to the proportions\r\nfound in _arnuxii_. It might be suspected on this account that the\r\nexternal measurements of _bairdii_ were exaggerated, but that such is not\r\nthe case will appear from an examination of the measurements of vertebræ\r\ngiven on page 75. It is evident that the specimens of _bairdii_ are far\r\nmore massive in all parts of the skeleton than the specimen of _arnuxii_\r\nthere cited. The same relations will be found upon comparing measurements\r\nof the specimen of _arnuxii_ figured by Van Beneden and Gervais.[57] The\r\ntruth appears to be that _bairdii_ is a much larger species, but that the\r\nskull is considerably smaller relatively.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SKULL.\r\n\r\nThe skull of _Berardius bairdii_ presents many characters by which it may\r\nbe distinguished from that of _arnuxii_, whether adult or young. As\r\ncompared with the latter, the rostrum is less massive at the base. The\r\npterygoid has a rounded extension posteriorly and superiorly, so that the\r\nposterior portion of the upper border of the pterygoid sinus is convex,\r\nrather than nearly straight, as in _arnuxii_. The exoccipital is larger\r\nand broader distally below, and its external surface is plane or concave,\r\nrather than convex, as in _arnuxii_. The distal end of the zygomatic\r\nprocess is much more incurved. The nasal bones instead of presenting\r\nlateral extensions have nearly straight sides. The vomer is deeply\r\nemarginate at the base of the skull posteriorly where it rests against\r\nthe presphenoid. The palatines extend scarcely or not at all in front of\r\nthe pterygoids. The foregoing differences will readily be seen by\r\ncomparing the figures on Pls. 26-29 with those of the type of _B.\r\narnuxii_ given in Van Beneden and Gervais’s Osteography, plate 23.\r\n\r\nThe following are dimensions of skulls of both species:\r\n\r\n  _Dimensions of five skulls of Berardius bairdii (including the type)\r\n                  and of three skulls of B. arnuxii._\r\n\r\n  Column headings:\r\n    _B. arnuxii._\r\n      A: New Brighton, New Zealand (Flower).

While of about the same size in both species, the two bones\r\nwhen in the natural position, viewed from without, are nearly square\r\nrather than triangular in outline in _B. bairdii_, the superior border of\r\nthe periotic being nearly parallel with the inferior border of the\r\ntympanic, and the anterior lobe of the periotic being turned down nearly\r\nat right angles with the rest of the bone. The periotic is shorter\r\nanteriorly than the tympanic in _B. bairdii_, while the reverse is true\r\nin _B. arnuxii_. In the former species the eustachian canal of the\r\ntympanic is wider, the distance between the outer and inner lips being\r\ngreater. The involuted portion of the inner lip is shorter and\r\ndifferently shaped. The groove between the postero-inferior lobes is\r\nwider. The periotic beside having a much shorter anterior lobe than in\r\n_B. arnuxii_ has also a smaller and smoother middle lobe, and the\r\ninternal auditory meatus is smaller and more oblique. The dimensions of\r\nthe bones in the Centerville beach skull, No. 49725, are as follows:\r\n_Tympanic_: greatest length, 62 mm.; greatest breadth, 46; least breadth\r\nof eustachian canal, 17; height at sigmoid process, 47. _Periotic:_\r\ngreatest length, 66; greatest breadth, 40; height at center of middle\r\nlobe, 35; length from tip of anterior lobe to anterior margin of internal\r\nmeatus, 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TEETH.\r\n\r\nAlthough all the specimens of _Berardius bairdii_ are more or less\r\nincomplete, two or three of the mandibular teeth have been preserved in\r\nnearly every instance; namely, in the adult female from St. George\r\nIsland, the left anterior and right and left posterior; in the immature\r\nmale from the same island, both anterior teeth; in the Centerville beach\r\nspecimen, the left anterior and right (?) posterior teeth; in the skull\r\nfrom Bering Island formerly regarded as the type, all four teeth; in the\r\nvery young skull from Bering Island, the left anterior and posterior\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, these teeth are not larger than those found in the\r\nspecimens of _B. arnuxii_ thus far recorded, but in both species they\r\nvary so much on account of age, or for other reasons, that a comparison\r\nof dimensions is unsatisfactory.

Anterior tooth conical,\r\nhollow, with thin walls. The lower half of the tooth is filled with a\r\nmass of bony pulp, which is separable. The tooth is widest at the base,\r\nand is without any constriction indicating the formation of a root. Outer\r\nand inner surfaces slightly convex, the latter with several distinct\r\nlongitudinal furrows, which extend to the apex. The whole tooth has a\r\nthin coating of cement, except the tip, for a length of about 10 mm.,\r\nwhich is more nearly white, and consists, presumably, of dentine. The\r\ntooth is very symmetrical, but rather more convex externally. The apex is\r\npointed, erect, and a little more convex externally than internally. (Pl.\r\n39, figs. 1, 2.)\r\n\r\nThe posterior tooth is similar to the anterior one, but much shorter and\r\nmore blunt, and the longitudinal furrows are about equally distinct\r\nexternally and internally. The cement extends nearly to the apex, which\r\nlatter is very short and is directed backward.\r\n\r\n_No. 49727._—St. George Island, Alaska; male, immature. Anterior teeth\r\nconical, acute, somewhat unsymmetrical, rather more convex externally\r\nthan internally. The internal surface with a deep median longitudinal\r\ngroove, and others less distinct on each side near the base. Apex\r\nslightly inclined forward and inward, convex externally, with a single\r\nlongitudinal groove; nearly flat internally, with, or without, a groove.\r\nBase of tooth for about 17 mm. covered with longitudinal rugosities,\r\nindicating that the root was about to close. It is open, however, the\r\nwalls of the tooth at the narrowest point being 8 mm. apart and the\r\ncavity filled with dense bony pulp. The anterior and posterior outlines\r\nof the teeth are irregular, being convex near the base, then slightly\r\nconcave, and again convex near the apex. When in the natural position,\r\nthese teeth protrude about 33 mm., or a little more than one-third their\r\nheight, above the alveolus. (Pl. 39, figs. 3, 4.)\r\n\r\nPosterior teeth lacking.\r\n\r\n_No. 49725._—Centerville beach, California; male (?), adult. Anterior\r\ntooth conical, with anterior and posterior margins as in the last. Apex\r\nconsiderably abraded and rounded off; not inclined inward or forward.\r\nInternal and external surfaces nearly equally convex, but the former with\r\na broad median longitudinal groove. Root closed, the base of the tooth\r\nfor a breadth of about 30 mm. covered with rounded rugosities. The\r\ninferior border slightly convex and the angles rounded off. When in the\r\nnatural position, somewhat more than one-half of the tooth protrudes\r\nbeyond the alveolus, and the tooth itself is inclined forward and\r\noutward. (Pl. 39, fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nPosterior tooth quite irregular in form, but the portion above the rugose\r\nbase or root conical. Inner surface flat and uneven. Outer surface convex\r\nand rather rugose. The cement covers the whole tooth thickly to within\r\nabout 5 mm. of the apex, which latter is short, quite acute, and slightly\r\ndirected inward. It is convex externally and nearly flat internally. The\r\nbasal rugosity or root is conical, thicker than the rest of the tooth,\r\nand unsymmetrical, being somewhat directed backward. It shows no opening\r\nbelow. When in the natural position this tooth is strongly inclined\r\nforward and outward, and only the tip for a length of 22 mm. protrudes\r\nbeyond the alveolus. (Pl. 39, fig. 6.)\r\n\r\n_No. 49726._—St. George Island, Alaska; female, adult. Anterior tooth\r\nconical, with the tip blunt, having been so much abraded that the dentine\r\ndoes not extend beyond the coating of cement. The tip measures 26 by 19\r\nmm. The external and internal surfaces of the tooth are about equally\r\nconvex and somewhat rugose without distinct furrows. The root is thicker\r\nthan the remainder of the tooth and very rugose. It is entirely closed\r\nbelow, and the inferior outline is convex. Posterior tooth much\r\ncompressed, conical above the root, nearly flat internally and slightly\r\nconvex externally. Cement coating very thick and extending to within\r\nabout 5 mm. of the dentine apex, which latter is acute and very slightly\r\ncurved inward and backward. The root is very unsymmetrical, the posterior\r\nportion being much longer than the anterior. The surface is very rugose,\r\nand there is no opening whatever below. The inferior border is convex,\r\nwith an emargination near the center. (Pl. 39, figs. 7, 8.)\r\n\r\nIn the adult skull from Bering Island, which has been mounted and placed\r\non exhibition, the teeth are fixed in the alveoli so that their entire\r\nlength and the peculiarities of the basal portion can not be determined.\r\nIn general form, however, they resemble those of the preceding specimen\r\nvery closely. The anterior teeth are placed obliquely—that is, so that\r\nthe anterior margins of the two teeth are nearer together than the\r\nposterior margins. The teeth are also somewhat inclined forward. The\r\nposterior teeth are strongly inclined forward and a little outward.\r\n\r\nThe anterior teeth are rather concave along the middle internally and\r\nconvex externally. The portion above the alveoli is quite smooth.\r\n\r\nThe posterior teeth are moderately rugose above the alveoli. The whitish\r\ntips of denture are conical, compressed, and rather acute. They extend 6\r\nmm. above the denture, and are 11 mm. long at their base, and 6 mm.\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nThe anterior teeth protrude about 45 mm. above the alveolus (internally);\r\ntheir base at the alveolus is from 73 to 76 mm. long, and from 33 to 35\r\nmm. thick. The posterior teeth extend about 18 mm. above the alveoli\r\n(measured vertically from the alveolus), and the base of the visible\r\nportion (measured along the alveolus) is from 30 to 34 mm. long and from\r\n18 to 20 mm. thick. These teeth have an antero-external angular\r\nenlargement of the cement, so that they are somewhat triangular in\r\nhorizontal section. (Pl. 30, fig. 3; pl. 31, fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe data available are insufficient to enable one to determine\r\nsatisfactorily whether the teeth differ materially in size in the two\r\nsexes, but it appears probable that they do not.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SKELETON.\r\n\r\nWhile the skeleton of _Berardius bairdii_ (Pl. 42, fig. 4) resembles that\r\nof _B. arnuxii_ very closely in most particulars, it presents differences\r\nwhich may properly be regarded as specific. The vertebral formula of _B.\r\narnuxii_ as given by Flower is as follows: C. 7, Th. 10, L. 12, Ca. 19 =\r\n48.[58] The same formula is given for another specimen of _B. arnuxii_ by\r\nVan Beneden and Gervais, except that the caudals are 17, two being\r\napparently lacking.[59]\r\n\r\nDoctor Hector, however, gives a different formula for a third specimen of\r\nthis species, namely, C. 7, Th. 10, L. 13, Ca. 17 = 47. He remarks that\r\n“extreme care was taken to secure the whole of the small tail bones.”[60]\r\nThe discrepancy here shown can not be accounted for at present, but, at\r\nall events, none of the formulas of _B. arnuxii_ corresponds to that of\r\n_B. bairdii_, as derived from the three skeletons in the National Museum,\r\nnamely, C. 7, Th. 11, L. 12, Ca. 16+ = 46+.\r\n\r\nThe number of thoracic vertebræ can be determined positively from the\r\nyoungish male from St. George Island (Cat. No. 49727), in which ten pairs\r\nof ribs are present, together with one rib belonging to the eleventh\r\npair. This last is much shorter than the tenth pair, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that it really belongs to a terminal pair. In this skeleton the\r\ntransverse processes of the eleventh thoracic vertebra are thick at the\r\nfree end like those of the tenth thoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\nIn the adult male from Centerville beach, California, only ten pairs of\r\nribs are present, but as the tenth is quite as long as the ninth, there\r\nis little doubt that an eleventh pair was present originally. The\r\neleventh thoracic vertebra, however, has transverse processes longer and\r\nmore flattened at the free end than those of the tenth thoracic. It is\r\npossible, of course, that the real eleventh thoracic is lacking, and that\r\nthis individual had thirteen lumbar vertebræ, but of this there is no\r\npositive evidence.\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the ribs accompany the skeleton of the adult female from\r\nSt. George Island, Alaska (Cat. No. 49726), but there are eleven thoracic\r\nvertebræ, the transverse processes of the eleventh being short and thick,\r\nlike those of the tenth, with a distinct facet for the rib at the free\r\nend. This facet, however, is directed obliquely backward and occupies\r\nonly the posterior half of the free margin.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the number of thoracic vertebræ in _B.\r\nbairdii_ is normally 11 and in _B. arnuxii_, 10. This would ordinarily be\r\nof little importance, as in nearly all kinds of cetaceans a variation of\r\none, or even two, in the number of thoracic and lumbar vertebræ in\r\ndifferent individuals of the same species is commonly met with. In the\r\npresent family, however, the number of thoracic vertebræ shows little\r\nvariation, and as all known skeletons of _B. bairdii_ have eleven\r\nthoracics and all known skeletons of _arnuxii_ appear to have ten\r\nthoracics, it seems probable that this difference is specific. At all\r\nevents, it is correlated with a difference in the form of the vertebræ\r\nthemselves. As is well known, the transverse processes of the thoracics\r\nin this family undergo a sudden change of form and position near the end\r\nof the series, the elevated processes on the anterior thoracics being\r\nreplaced on the posterior vertebræ by others at a lower level on the\r\nsides of the centra. This change takes place differently and on different\r\nvertebræ in the two species under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               VERTEBRÆ.\r\n\r\nIn _B. arnuxii_ the eighth thoracic has no facet at the posterior end of\r\nthe centrum for the articulation of the head of a ninth rib and no\r\ndistinct transverse process, the tubercle of the rib articulating with a\r\nfacet on the side of the metapophysis. In _B. bairdii_ the eighth\r\nthoracic is similar, but there is a distinct facet at the posterior end\r\nof the centrum. (Pl. 32, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nIn _B. arnuxii_ the ninth thoracic has a very distinct transverse process\r\non the side of the centrum, while in _B. bairdii_ the ninth thoracic has\r\na short, slender process attached to the side of the metapophysis and no\r\nfacet at the posterior end of the centrum. (Pl. 32, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nIn _B. arnuxii_ the tenth thoracic is the second one having a distinct\r\ntransverse process, and the latter is broad distally and has the\r\narticular facet on the posterior portion of the free margin. In _B.\r\nbairdii_ the tenth thoracic is the first having a distinct transverse\r\nprocess on the side of the centrum. (Pl. 32, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThere are only ten thoracics in _B. arnuxii_, as already mentioned, but\r\nin _B. bairdii_ there are eleven, and the eleventh is that which bears\r\nthe second transverse process on the side of the centrum.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing differences amount to this: That in _B. bairdii_ the\r\ncommencement of the lower series of transverse processes is pushed back\r\none vertebra, as compared with _B. arnuxii_, and that in the ninth\r\nthoracic of the former species, which corresponds to the eighth of the\r\nlatter species, the metapophysis has a short process on the side for the\r\narticulation of the tubercle of the rib, instead of merely a sessile\r\nfacet. Although in other genera of ziphioids these differences would\r\nperhaps be looked upon as individual, since they are constant here they\r\nmay be considered specific, at least provisionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SCAPULA.\r\n\r\nIn _B. bairdii_ the anterior border of the scapula is narrower than in\r\n_B. arnuxii_, the anterior ridge coming close to it and lying parallel\r\nwith it. The acromion is directed more upward, so that the angle between\r\nit and the body of the scapula is more acute, and the process itself is\r\nrather more expanded distally. The coronoid is inclined a little more\r\ndownward. The whole surface of the scapula is very uneven. (Pl. 33, fig.\r\n2.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HUMERUS AND ULNA.\r\n\r\nThe humerus is shorter than in _B. arnuxii_ and broader distally, and\r\nmuch more recurved on the ulnar side. The ulna is much broader distally\r\nand its whole shape is different. (Pl. 33, figs. 3 and 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHEVRONS.\r\n\r\nAs the skeleton of the typical form _arnuxii_ has been described in\r\nconsiderable detail and accurately figured by Flower and by Van Beneden\r\nand Gervais, it is not considered necessary to give a complete\r\ndescription of that of _bairdii_ in this place. The entire skeleton and\r\nmany of the separate bones are figured in Pls. 42, 32, and 33. The\r\nphalanges are lacking altogether, or are incompletely represented, in the\r\nvarious skeletons of _bairdii_, and for that reason the phalangeal\r\nformula can not be given. The chevrons number ten in the skeleton from\r\nCenterville beach, California (Cat. No. 49725). Both Flower and Van\r\nBeneden and Gervais give nine chevrons as the number for the skeleton of\r\n_arnuxii_ in the Hunterian Museum, London, but the latter authors have\r\nadded a tenth in outline in the figure of the skeleton of that species\r\nwhich is in the Paris Museum. Ten are mentioned by Hector as the correct\r\nnumber for the skeleton of _arnuxii_ from Wellington Harbor examined by\r\nhim.[61]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                STERNUM.\r\n\r\nThe sternum of _bairdii_ (Pl. 32, fig. 2) consists of five segments and\r\ndoes not offer characters by which to distinguish it from that of\r\n_arnuxii_. In the former species the first eight pairs of ribs possess\r\ndistinct heads and tubercles; the tubercle is rudimentary in the ninth\r\npair and absent in the tenth and eleventh.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the three skeletons of _bairdii_ and of that of\r\n_arnuxii_ described by Flower are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Dimensions of one skeleton of Berardius arnuxii and three skeletons of\r\n                              B. bairdii._\r\n\r\n  Column Headings:\r\n    _B. arnuxii._\r\n      B: New Brighton, New Zealand, 1868, (Flower).

Its catalogue number is\r\n14499. This skeleton is about 19 feet long and has the following\r\nvertebral formula: C. 7; Th. 9; L. 9; Ca. 19 (+1?) = 44 (or 45). Eight\r\nchevrons are attached to the caudal vertebræ, and at least two more were\r\npresent originally. The fifth thoracic vertebra has no facet on the\r\ncentrum for the head of the sixth rib, but the latter articulates with a\r\nsmall facet on the side of the centrum of the sixth thoracic vertebra.\r\nThe seventh thoracic has a well-developed transverse process on the side\r\nof the centrum. The ninth rib is shorter and more slender than the\r\nothers. None of the transverse processes of the caudal vertebræ are\r\nperforated by foramina. These processes end on the eighth caudal, and the\r\nneural spines on the tenth caudal. The free ends of the neural spines of\r\nthe thoracic and lumbar vertebræ are all more or less rounded. The\r\npectoral limbs are incomplete.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, only three examples of _Hyperoödon_ have been taken\r\non the coasts of the United States, as mentioned in the list on page 2.\r\nThe skeleton of one of these (from North Dennis, Massachusetts) is in the\r\nMuseum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the skull of\r\nthe second (from Newport, Rhode Island), which was a female, is in the\r\nAcademy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.[62] This skull is\r\nrepresented in Pl. 32, fig. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              LIST OF SPECIES OF EXISTING ZIPHIOID WHALES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Genus MESOPLODON Gervais.\r\n  MESOPLODON BIDENS (Sowerby).\r\n    North Atlantic Ocean; northern France to Norway and Sweden; Nantucket\r\n          Island, Massachusetts.\r\n  MESOPLODON EUROPÆUS (Gervais).\r\n    North Atlantic Ocean; English Channel; New Jersey.\r\n  MESOPLODON GRAYI Haast.\r\n    New Zealand and Chatham Islands; Bahia Nueva, Patagonia (Moreno).\r\n  MESOPLODON DENSIROSTRIS (Blainville).\r\n    Indian Ocean and South Seas; Lord Howe Island; Seychelles Islands;\r\n          South Africa; Massachusetts(?).\r\n  MESOPLODON HECTORI (Gray).\r\n    New Zealand.\r\n  MESOPLODON BOWDOINI Andrews.\r\n    New Zealand.\r\n  MESOPLODON LAYARDI (Gray).\r\n    South Seas; New Zealand, Chatham Islands; Australia; Cape of Good Hope.\r\n  MESOPLODON STEJNEGERI True.\r\n    North Pacific Ocean; Bering Island and Oregon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Genus ZIPHIUS Cuvier.\r\n  ZIPHIUS CAVIROSTRIS Cuvier.\r\n    Cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Genus BERARDIUS Duvernoy.\r\n  BERARDIUS ARNUXII Duvernoy.\r\n    New Zealand.\r\n  BERARDIUS BAIRDII Stejneger.\r\n    North Pacific Ocean; Bering Island and St. George Island, Bering Sea,\r\n          to Kiska Harbor, Alaska, and Centerville, California.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Genus HYPEROÖDON Lacépède.\r\n  HYPEROÖDON AMPULLATUS Forster.\r\n    Arctic and North Atlantic oceans; Mediterranean Sea; southern France;\r\n          New York Bay, Newport, Rhode Island, and Cape Cod,\r\n          Massachusetts.\r\n  HYPEROÖDON PLANIFRONS Flower.\r\n    Indian and Pacific oceans; Lewis Island, Australia; Province of\r\n          Buenos Ayres, Argentina, and territories of Chubut and Santa\r\n          Cruz, Patagonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]As this species is well known, the skeleton is not described in this\r\n    paper.\r\n\r\n[2]Amer.

The question whether a Hyperodon\r\n    visits this side of the Atlantic, has at length been solved by the\r\n    description which I have received through Dr. Alexander Wilcocks of\r\n    this city, of a species taken in Charleston Harbor. This is well\r\n    drawn up by Gabriel Manigault, who set up the specimen, which adorns\r\n    the Charleston Museum. The points wherein it evidently differs from\r\n    its congeners, the _H. bidens_ and _latifrons_, are, first, the\r\n    separation of the four posterior cervical vertebræ, the three\r\n    anterior only being solidly anchylosed, instead of the seven, as in\r\n    the known species, even in the young, according to Dr. J. E. Gray.\r\n    Second, the possession of one or more pairs of ribs added to the\r\n    flying series, and of two more vertebræ, including ten dorsal instead\r\n    of nine. (Nine are given by Cuvier, Ossemens Fossiles, viii, 188; and\r\n    Flower, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1864, 419, for the _bidens_.) Five\r\n    ribs are connected with the sternum, of which the anterior\r\n    articulates with the seventh cervical by its inferior head.\r\n\r\n    “I extract the following from Gabr. Manigault’s description:\r\n\r\n    “‘The superior maxillary bones are quite pointed in front and widen\r\n    out toward the base of the snout. Their lateral edges become\r\n    developed on each side into a prominent vertical ridge, which is\r\n    slightly convex on the outer surface, and the reverse on the inner.\r\n    These bones, after having widened out upon approaching the orbits,\r\n    ascend vertically along with the occipital (the two together holding\r\n    the frontal, which is quite perceptible, between them) and form at\r\n    the back of the head a transverse ridge, which is quite high and very\r\n    thick. From my not knowing by what name it was known, I did not\r\n    satisfy myself concerning the presence of palatine tubercles. Another\r\n    peculiarity of the head consists in the lower maxillary bones being\r\n    provided each at its point with a single small and very sharp tooth.\r\n    These were not noticed during the dissection, owing to their being\r\n    too much imbedded in the integuments; they are now, however, quite\r\n    visible. In the cavity of the skull is a septum of bone separating\r\n    the cerebrum from the cerebellum (_i. e._, the tentorium). The first\r\n    rib is very wide and short, and presents a marked contrast to the\r\n    others. The sternum is quite flat and wide. The pectoral fins are\r\n    small, and have been carefully preserved, with the various carpal and\r\n    phalangeal bones kept together by their natural ligaments. As the\r\n    skeleton stands, the fins consist only of the scapula, the humerus,\r\n    the radius, and the ulna, with but few phalanges.\r\n\r\n    “‘The length of this specimen is between twelve and thirteen feet.’”\r\n    (_Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila._, 1865, p. 15.)\r\n\r\n[39]The Buenos Ayres specimen is not included here, as I am uncertain as\r\n    to its proper interpretation.\r\n\r\n[40]Trans. New Zealand Inst., vol. 5, 1873, p. 164, pls. 4-5.\r\n\r\n[41]Hector also figures a tooth from a specimen found at Manawatu beach\r\n    in pl. 5, fig. 3, which is like those of the Chatham Island specimen\r\n    in size and shape (diameter 34 mm.), and should belong to a male, but\r\n    as he does not figure or describe the skull this can not be used in\r\n    the present discussion.\r\n\r\n[42]Trans.
