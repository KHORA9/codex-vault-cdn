Drawn by P. Kauffmann,\r\netched by Deblois.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATORY EPISTLE First prefixed to the Edition of 1845\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nJOHN GIBSON, R.A., SCULPTOR.\r\n\r\nIn looking round the wide and luminous circle of our great living\r\nEnglishmen, to select one to whom I might fitly dedicate this work,--one\r\nwho, in his life as in his genius, might illustrate the principle I have\r\nsought to convey; elevated by the ideal which he exalts, and\r\nserenely dwelling in a glorious existence with the images born of his\r\nimagination,--in looking round for some such man, my thoughts rested\r\nupon you. Afar from our turbulent cabals; from the ignoble jealousy and\r\nthe sordid strife which degrade and acerbate the ambition of Genius,--in\r\nyour Roman Home, you have lived amidst all that is loveliest and least\r\nperishable in the past, and contributed with the noblest aims, and in\r\nthe purest spirit, to the mighty heirlooms of the future. Your youth has\r\nbeen devoted to toil, that your manhood may be consecrated to fame: a\r\nfame unsullied by one desire of gold. You have escaped the two worst\r\nperils that beset the artist in our time and land,--the debasing\r\ntendencies of commerce, and the angry rivalries of competition. You have\r\nnot wrought your marble for the market,--you have not been tempted, by\r\nthe praises which our vicious criticism has showered upon exaggeration\r\nand distortion, to lower your taste to the level of the hour; you\r\nhave lived, and you have laboured, as if you had no rivals but in the\r\ndead,--no purchasers, save in judges of what is best. In the divine\r\npriesthood of the beautiful, you have sought only to increase her\r\nworshippers and enrich her temples. The pupil of Canova, you have\r\ninherited his excellences, while you have shunned his errors,--yours his\r\ndelicacy, not his affectation. Your heart resembles him even more\r\nthan your genius: you have the same noble enthusiasm for your sublime\r\nprofession; the same lofty freedom from envy, and the spirit that\r\ndepreciates; the same generous desire not to war with but to serve\r\nartists in your art; aiding, strengthening, advising, elevating the\r\ntimidity of inexperience, and the vague aspirations of youth. By\r\nthe intuition of a kindred mind, you have equalled the learning\r\nof Winckelman, and the plastic poetry of Goethe, in the intimate\r\ncomprehension of the antique. Each work of yours, rightly studied, is in\r\nitself a CRITICISM, illustrating the sublime secrets of the Grecian\r\nArt, which, without the servility of plagiarism, you have contributed to\r\nrevive amongst us; in you we behold its three great and long-undetected\r\nprinciples,--simplicity, calm, and concentration.\r\n\r\nBut your admiration of the Greeks has not led you to the bigotry of\r\nthe mere antiquarian, nor made you less sensible of the unappreciated\r\nexcellence of the mighty modern, worthy to be your countryman,--though\r\ntill his statue is in the streets of our capital, we show ourselves not\r\nworthy of the glory he has shed upon our land. You have not suffered\r\neven your gratitude to Canova to blind you to the superiority of\r\nFlaxman. When we become sensible of our title-deeds to renown in that\r\nsingle name, we may look for an English public capable of real patronage\r\nto English Art,--and not till then.\r\n\r\nI, artist in words, dedicate, then, to you, artist whose ideas speak in\r\nmarble, this well-loved work of my matured manhood. I love it not the\r\nless because it has been little understood and superficially judged\r\nby the common herd: it was not meant for them. I love it not the more\r\nbecause it has found enthusiastic favorers amongst the Few. My affection\r\nfor my work is rooted in the solemn and pure delight which it gave me\r\nto conceive and to perform. If I had graven it on the rocks of a desert,\r\nthis apparition of my own innermost mind, in its least-clouded moments,\r\nwould have been to me as dear; and this ought, I believe, to be the\r\nsentiment with which he whose Art is born of faith in the truth and\r\nbeauty of the principles he seeks to illustrate, should regard his work.\r\nYour serener existence, uniform and holy, my lot denies,--if my heart\r\ncovets. But our true nature is in our thoughts, not our deeds: and\r\ntherefore, in books--which ARE his thoughts--the author’s character lies\r\nbare to the discerning eye. It is not in the life of cities,--in the\r\nturmoil and the crowd; it is in the still, the lonely, and more sacred\r\nlife, which for some hours, under every sun, the student lives (his\r\nstolen retreat from the Agora to the Cave), that I feel there is between\r\nus the bond of that secret sympathy, that magnetic chain, which unites\r\nthe everlasting brotherhood of whose being Zanoni is the type.\r\n\r\nE.B.L. London, May, 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of Bulwer was his passion for occult studies.\r\nThey had a charm for him early in life, and he pursued them with the\r\nearnestness which characterised his pursuit of other studies. He\r\nbecame absorbed in wizard lore; he equipped himself with magical\r\nimplements,--with rods for transmitting influence, and crystal balls\r\nin which to discern coming scenes and persons; and communed with\r\nspiritualists and mediums. The fruit of these mystic studies is seen in\r\n“Zanoni” and “A strange Story,” romances which were a labour of love to\r\nthe author, and into which he threw all the power he possessed,--power\r\nre-enforced by multifarious reading and an instinctive appreciation\r\nof Oriental thought. These weird stories, in which the author has\r\nformulated his theory of magic, are of a wholly different type from his\r\nprevious fictions, and, in place of the heroes and villains of every\r\nday life, we have beings that belong in part to another sphere, and that\r\ndeal with mysterious and occult agencies. Once more the old forgotten\r\nlore of the Cabala is unfolded; the furnace of the alchemist, whose\r\nfires have been extinct for centuries, is lighted anew, and the lamp\r\nof the Rosicrucian re-illumined. No other works of the author,\r\ncontradictory as have been the opinions of them, have provoked such\r\na diversity of criticism as these. To some persons they represent\r\na temporary aberration of genius rather than any serious thought or\r\ndefinite purpose; while others regard them as surpassing in bold and\r\noriginal speculation, profound analysis of character, and thrilling\r\ninterest, all of the author’s other works. The truth, we believe,\r\nlies midway between these extremes. It is questionable whether the\r\nintroduction into a novel of such subjects as are discussed in these\r\nromances be not an offence against good sense and good taste; but it\r\nis as unreasonable to deny the vigour and originality of their author’s\r\nconceptions, as to deny that the execution is imperfect, and, at times,\r\nbungling and absurd.\r\n\r\nIt has been justly said that the present half century has witnessed\r\nthe rise and triumphs of science, the extent and marvels of which even\r\nBacon’s fancy never conceived, simultaneously with superstitions grosser\r\nthan any which Bacon’s age believed. “The one is, in fact, the\r\nnatural reaction from the other. The more science seeks to exclude\r\nthe miraculous, and reduce all nature, animate and inanimate, to an\r\ninvariable law of sequences, the more does the natural instinct of man\r\nrebel, and seek an outlet for those obstinate questionings, those ‘blank\r\nmisgivings of a creature moving about in worlds not realised,’ taking\r\nrefuge in delusions as degrading as any of the so-called Dark Ages.” It\r\nwas the revolt from the chilling materialism of the age which inspired\r\nthe mystic creations of “Zanoni” and “A Strange Story.” Of these works,\r\nwhich support and supplement each other, one is the contemplation of our\r\nactual life through a spiritual medium, the other is designed to show\r\nthat, without some gleams of the supernatural, man is not man, nor\r\nnature nature.\r\n\r\nIn “Zanoni” the author introduces us to two human beings who have\r\nachieved immortality: one, Mejnour, void of all passion or feeling,\r\ncalm, benignant, bloodless, an intellect rather than a man; the other,\r\nZanoni, the pupil of Mejnour, the representative of an ideal life in\r\nits utmost perfection, possessing eternal youth, absolute power, and\r\nabsolute knowledge, and withal the fullest capacity to enjoy and to\r\nlove, and, as a necessity of that love, to sorrow and despair. By his\r\nlove for Viola Zanoni is compelled to descend from his exalted state,\r\nto lose his eternal calm, and to share in the cares and anxieties of\r\nhumanity; and this degradation is completed by the birth of a child.\r\nFinally, he gives up the life which hangs on that of another, in order\r\nto save that other, the loving and beloved wife, who has delivered\r\nhim from his solitude and isolation. Wife and child are mortal, and to\r\noutlive them and his love for them is impossible. But Mejnour, who is\r\nthe impersonation of thought,--pure intellect without affection,--lives\r\non.\r\n\r\nBulwer has himself justly characterised this work, in the Introduction,\r\nas a romance and not a romance, as a truth for those who can comprehend\r\nit, and an extravagance for those who cannot. The most careless or\r\nmatter-of-fact reader must see that the work, like the enigmatical\r\n“Faust,” deals in types and symbols; that the writer intends to suggest\r\nto the mind something more subtle and impalpable than that which is\r\nembodied to the senses. What that something is, hardly two persons will\r\nagree. The most obvious interpretation of the types is, that in Zanoni\r\nthe author depicts to us humanity, perfected, sublimed, which lives\r\nnot for self, but for others; in Mejnour, as we have before said, cold,\r\npassionless, self-sufficing intellect; in Glyndon, the young Englishman,\r\nthe mingled strength and weakness of human nature; in the heartless,\r\nselfish artist, Nicot, icy, soulless atheism, believing nothing, hoping\r\nnothing, trusting and loving nothing; and in the beautiful, artless\r\nViola, an exquisite creation, pure womanhood, loving, trusting and\r\ntruthful. As a work of art the romance is one of great power. It is\r\noriginal in its conception, and pervaded by one central idea; but\r\nit would have been improved, we think, by a more sparing use of the\r\nsupernatural. The inevitable effect of so much hackneyed diablerie--of\r\nsuch an accumulation of wonder upon wonder--is to deaden the impression\r\nthey would naturally make upon us. In Hawthorne’s tales we see with what\r\nease a great imaginative artist can produce a deeper thrill by a far\r\nslighter use of the weird and the mysterious.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest of the story for the ordinary reader centres, not in\r\nits ghostly characters and improbable machinery, the scenes in Mejnour’s\r\nchamber in the ruined castle among the Apennines, the colossal and\r\nappalling apparitions on Vesuvius, the hideous phantom with its burning\r\neye that haunted Glyndon, but in the loves of Viola and the mysterious\r\nZanoni, the blissful and the fearful scenes through which they pass,\r\nand their final destiny, when the hero of the story sacrifices his\r\nown “charmed life” to save hers, and the Immortal finds the only true\r\nimmortality in death. Among the striking passages in the work are the\r\npathetic sketch of the old violinist and composer, Pisani, with his\r\nsympathetic “barbiton” which moaned, groaned, growled, and laughed\r\nresponsive to the feelings of its master; the description of Viola’s and\r\nher father’s triumph, when “The Siren,” his masterpiece, is performed at\r\nthe San Carlo in Naples; Glyndon’s adventure at the Carnival in Naples;\r\nthe death of his sister; the vivid pictures of the Reign of Terror in\r\nParis, closing with the downfall of Robespierre and his satellites; and\r\nperhaps, above all, the thrilling scene where Zanoni leaves Viola asleep\r\nin prison when his guards call him to execution, and she, unconscious of\r\nthe terrible sacrifice, but awaking and missing him, has a vision of the\r\nprocession to the guillotine, with Zanoni there, radiant in youth\r\nand beauty, followed by the sudden vanishing of the headsman,--the\r\nhorror,--and the “Welcome” of her loved one to Heaven in a myriad of\r\nmelodies from the choral hosts above.\r\n\r\n“Zanoni” was originally published by Saunders and Otley, London, in\r\nthree volumes 12mo., in 1842. A translation into French, made by M.\r\nSheldon under the direction of P. Lorain, was published in Paris in the\r\n“Bibliotheque des Meilleurs Romans Etrangers.”\r\n\r\nW.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1853.\r\n\r\nAs a work of imagination, “Zanoni” ranks, perhaps, amongst the highest\r\nof my prose fictions. In the Poem of “King Arthur,” published many years\r\nafterwards, I have taken up an analogous design, in the contemplation\r\nof our positive life through a spiritual medium; and I have enforced,\r\nthrough a far wider development, and, I believe, with more complete and\r\nenduring success, that harmony between the external events which are\r\nall that the superficial behold on the surface of human affairs, and the\r\nsubtle and intellectual agencies which in reality influence the conduct\r\nof individuals, and shape out the destinies of the world. As man has two\r\nlives,--that of action and that of thought,--so I conceive that work\r\nto be the truest representation of humanity which faithfully delineates\r\nboth, and opens some elevating glimpse into the sublimest mysteries of\r\nour being, by establishing the inevitable union that exists between\r\nthe plain things of the day, in which our earthly bodies perform their\r\nallotted part, and the latent, often uncultivated, often invisible,\r\naffinities of the soul with all the powers that eternally breathe and\r\nmove throughout the Universe of Spirit.\r\n\r\nI refer those who do me the honour to read “Zanoni” with more attention\r\nthan is given to ordinary romance, to the Poem of “King Arthur,” for\r\nsuggestive conjecture into most of the regions of speculative research,\r\naffecting the higher and more important condition of our ultimate being,\r\nwhich have engaged the students of immaterial philosophy in my own age.\r\n\r\nAffixed to the “Note” with which this work concludes, and which treats\r\nof the distinctions between type and allegory, the reader will find,\r\nfrom the pen of one of our most eminent living writers, an ingenious\r\nattempt to explain the interior or typical meanings of the work now\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that among my readers there may be a few not unacquainted\r\nwith an old-book shop, existing some years since in the neighbourhood\r\nof Covent Garden; I say a few, for certainly there was little enough to\r\nattract the many in those precious volumes which the labour of a life\r\nhad accumulated on the dusty shelves of my old friend D--. There were to\r\nbe found no popular treatises, no entertaining romances, no histories,\r\nno travels, no “Library for the People,” no “Amusement for the Million.”\r\n But there, perhaps, throughout all Europe, the curious might discover\r\nthe most notable collection, ever amassed by an enthusiast, of the works\r\nof alchemist, cabalist, and astrologer. The owner had lavished a fortune\r\nin the purchase of unsalable treasures. But old D-- did not desire to\r\nsell. It absolutely went to his heart when a customer entered his shop:\r\nhe watched the movements of the presumptuous intruder with a vindictive\r\nglare; he fluttered around him with uneasy vigilance,--he frowned, he\r\ngroaned, when profane hands dislodged his idols from their niches. If\r\nit were one of the favourite sultanas of his wizard harem that attracted\r\nyou, and the price named were not sufficiently enormous, he would not\r\nunfrequently double the sum. Demur, and in brisk delight he snatched the\r\nvenerable charmer from your hands; accede, and he became the picture of\r\ndespair,--nor unfrequently, at the dead of night, would he knock at your\r\ndoor, and entreat you to sell him back, at your own terms, what you had\r\nso egregiously bought at his. A believer himself in his Averroes and\r\nParacelsus, he was as loth as the philosophers he studied to communicate\r\nto the profane the learning he had collected.\r\n\r\nIt so chanced that some years ago, in my younger days, whether of\r\nauthorship or life, I felt a desire to make myself acquainted with\r\nthe true origin and tenets of the singular sect known by the name of\r\nRosicrucians. Dissatisfied with the scanty and superficial accounts to\r\nbe found in the works usually referred to on the subject, it struck\r\nme as possible that Mr. D--‘s collection, which was rich, not only in\r\nblack-letter, but in manuscripts, might contain some more accurate and\r\nauthentic records of that famous brotherhood,--written, who knows?\r\nby one of their own order, and confirming by authority and detail the\r\npretensions to wisdom and to virtue which Bringaret had arrogated to the\r\nsuccessors of the Chaldean and Gymnosophist. Accordingly I repaired to\r\nwhat, doubtless, I ought to be ashamed to confess, was once one of\r\nmy favourite haunts. But are there no errors and no fallacies, in the\r\nchronicles of our own day, as absurd as those of the alchemists of old?\r\nOur very newspapers may seem to our posterity as full of delusions as\r\nthe books of the alchemists do to us; not but what the press is the air\r\nwe breathe,--and uncommonly foggy the air is too!\r\n\r\nOn entering the shop, I was struck by the venerable appearance of a\r\ncustomer whom I had never seen there before. I was struck yet more\r\nby the respect with which he was treated by the disdainful collector.\r\n“Sir,” cried the last, emphatically, as I was turning over the leaves of\r\nthe catalogue,--“sir, you are the only man I have met, in five-and-forty\r\nyears that I have spent in these researches, who is worthy to be my\r\ncustomer. How--where, in this frivolous age, could you have acquired\r\na knowledge so profound? And this august fraternity, whose doctrines,\r\nhinted at by the earliest philosophers, are still a mystery to the\r\nlatest; tell me if there really exists upon the earth any book,\r\nany manuscript, in which their discoveries, their tenets, are to be\r\nlearned?”\r\n\r\nAt the words, “august fraternity,” I need scarcely say that my attention\r\nhad been at once aroused, and I listened eagerly for the stranger’s\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“I do not think,” said the old gentleman, “that the masters of the\r\nschool have ever consigned, except by obscure hint and mystical parable,\r\ntheir real doctrines to the world. And I do not blame them for their\r\ndiscretion.”\r\n\r\nHere he paused, and seemed about to retire, when I said, somewhat\r\nabruptly, to the collector, “I see nothing, Mr. D--, in this catalogue\r\nwhich relates to the Rosicrucians!”\r\n\r\n“The Rosicrucians!” repeated the old gentleman, and in his turn he\r\nsurveyed me with deliberate surprise. “Who but a Rosicrucian could\r\nexplain the Rosicrucian mysteries! And can you imagine that any members\r\nof that sect, the most jealous of all secret societies, would themselves\r\nlift the veil that hides the Isis of their wisdom from the world?”\r\n\r\n“Aha!” thought I, “this, then, is ‘the august fraternity’ of which\r\nyou spoke. Heaven be praised! I certainly have stumbled on one of the\r\nbrotherhood.”\r\n\r\n“But,” I said aloud, “if not in books, sir, where else am I to obtain\r\ninformation? Nowadays one can hazard nothing in print without authority,\r\nand one may scarcely quote Shakespeare without citing chapter and verse.\r\nThis is the age of facts,--the age of facts, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the old gentleman, with a pleasant smile, “if we meet\r\nagain, perhaps, at least, I may direct your researches to the proper\r\nsource of intelligence.” And with that he buttoned his greatcoat,\r\nwhistled to his dog, and departed.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that I did meet again with the old gentleman, exactly\r\nfour days after our brief conversation in Mr. D--‘s bookshop. I was\r\nriding leisurely towards Highgate, when, at the foot of its classic\r\nhill, I recognised the stranger; he was mounted on a black pony, and\r\nbefore him trotted his dog, which was black also.\r\n\r\nIf you meet the man whom you wish to know, on horseback, at the\r\ncommencement of a long hill, where, unless he has borrowed a friend’s\r\nfavourite hack, he cannot, in decent humanity to the brute creation,\r\nride away from you, I apprehend that it is your own fault if you have\r\nnot gone far in your object before you have gained the top. In short, so\r\nwell did I succeed, that on reaching Highgate the old gentleman invited\r\nme to rest at his house, which was a little apart from the village; and\r\nan excellent house it was,--small, but commodious, with a large garden,\r\nand commanding from the windows such a prospect as Lucretius would\r\nrecommend to philosophers: the spires and domes of London, on a clear\r\nday, distinctly visible; here the Retreat of the Hermit, and there the\r\nMare Magnum of the world.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the principal rooms were embellished with pictures of\r\nextraordinary merit, and in that high school of art which is so little\r\nunderstood out of Italy. I was surprised to learn that they were all\r\nfrom the hand of the owner. My evident admiration pleased my new friend,\r\nand led to talk upon his part, which showed him no less elevated in his\r\ntheories of art than an adept in the practice. Without fatiguing\r\nthe reader with irrelevant criticism, it is necessary, perhaps, as\r\nelucidating much of the design and character of the work which these\r\nprefatory pages introduce, that I should briefly observe, that he\r\ninsisted as much upon the connection of the arts, as a distinguished\r\nauthor has upon that of the sciences; that he held that in all works of\r\nimagination, whether expressed by words or by colours, the artist of the\r\nhigher schools must make the broadest distinction between the real and\r\nthe true,--in other words, between the imitation of actual life, and the\r\nexaltation of Nature into the Ideal.\r\n\r\n“The one,” said he, “is the Dutch School, the other is the Greek.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said I, “the Dutch is the most in fashion.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in painting, perhaps,” answered my host, “but in literature--”\r\n\r\n“It was of literature I spoke. Our growing poets are all for simplicity\r\nand Betty Foy; and our critics hold it the highest praise of a work of\r\nimagination, to say that its characters are exact to common life, even\r\nin sculpture--”\r\n\r\n“In sculpture! No, no! THERE the high ideal must at least be essential!”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me; I fear you have not seen Souter Johnny and Tam O’Shanter.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the old gentleman, shaking his head, “I live very much out of\r\nthe world, I see. I suppose Shakespeare has ceased to be admired?”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary; people make the adoration of Shakespeare the excuse\r\nfor attacking everybody else. But then our critics have discovered that\r\nShakespeare is so REAL!”\r\n\r\n“Real! The poet who has never once drawn a character to be met with in\r\nactual life,--who has never once descended to a passion that is false,\r\nor a personage who is real!”\r\n\r\nI was about to reply very severely to this paradox, when I perceived\r\nthat my companion was growing a little out of temper. And he who wishes\r\nto catch a Rosicrucian, must take care not to disturb the waters. I\r\nthought it better, therefore, to turn the conversation.\r\n\r\n“Revenons a nos moutons,” said I; “you promised to enlighten my\r\nignorance as to the Rosicrucians.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” quoth he, rather sternly; “but for what purpose? Perhaps you\r\ndesire only to enter the temple in order to ridicule the rites?”\r\n\r\n“What do you take me for! Surely, were I so inclined, the fate of the\r\nAbbe de Villars is a sufficient warning to all men not to treat idly\r\nof the realms of the Salamander and the Sylph. Everybody knows how\r\nmysteriously that ingenious personage was deprived of his life, in\r\nrevenge for the witty mockeries of his ‘Comte de Gabalis.’”\r\n\r\n“Salamander and Sylph! I see that you fall into the vulgar error, and\r\ntranslate literally the allegorical language of the mystics.”\r\n\r\nWith that the old gentleman condescended to enter into a very\r\ninteresting, and, as it seemed to me, a very erudite relation, of the\r\ntenets of the Rosicrucians, some of whom, he asserted, still existed,\r\nand still prosecuted, in august secrecy, their profound researches into\r\nnatural science and occult philosophy.\r\n\r\n“But this fraternity,” said he, “however respectable and\r\nvirtuous,--virtuous I say, for no monastic order is more severe in the\r\npractice of moral precepts, or more ardent in Christian faith,--this\r\nfraternity is but a branch of others yet more transcendent in the powers\r\nthey have obtained, and yet more illustrious in their origin. Are you\r\nacquainted with the Platonists?”\r\n\r\n“I have occasionally lost my way in their labyrinth,” said I. “Faith,\r\nthey are rather difficult gentlemen to understand.”\r\n\r\n“Yet their knottiest problems have never yet been published. Their\r\nsublimest works are in manuscript, and constitute the initiatory\r\nlearning, not only of the Rosicrucians, but of the nobler brotherhoods\r\nI have referred to. More solemn and sublime still is the knowledge to\r\nbe gleaned from the elder Pythagoreans, and the immortal masterpieces of\r\nApollonius.”\r\n\r\n“Apollonius, the imposter of Tyanea! are his writings extant?”\r\n\r\n“Imposter!” cried my host; “Apollonius an imposter!”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon; I did not know he was a friend of yours; and if\r\nyou vouch for his character, I will believe him to have been a very\r\nrespectable man, who only spoke the truth when he boasted of his power\r\nto be in two places at the same time.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so difficult?” said the old gentleman; “if so, you have never\r\ndreamed!”\r\n\r\nHere ended our conversation; but from that time an acquaintance was\r\nformed between us which lasted till my venerable friend departed\r\nthis life. Peace to his ashes! He was a person of singular habits and\r\neccentric opinions; but the chief part of his time was occupied in acts\r\nof quiet and unostentatious goodness. He was an enthusiast in the duties\r\nof the Samaritan; and as his virtues were softened by the gentlest\r\ncharity, so his hopes were based upon the devoutest belief. He never\r\nconversed upon his own origin and history, nor have I ever been able to\r\npenetrate the darkness in which they were concealed. He seemed to have\r\nseen much of the world, and to have been an eye-witness of the first\r\nFrench Revolution, a subject upon which he was equally eloquent and\r\ninstructive. At the same time he did not regard the crimes of that\r\nstormy period with the philosophical leniency with which enlightened\r\nwriters (their heads safe upon their shoulders) are, in the present day,\r\ninclined to treat the massacres of the past: he spoke not as a student\r\nwho had read and reasoned, but as a man who had seen and suffered. The\r\nold gentleman seemed alone in the world; nor did I know that he had one\r\nrelation, till his executor, a distant cousin, residing abroad, informed\r\nme of the very handsome legacy which my poor friend had bequeathed\r\nme. This consisted, first, of a sum about which I think it best to be\r\nguarded, foreseeing the possibility of a new tax upon real and funded\r\nproperty; and, secondly, of certain precious manuscripts, to which the\r\nfollowing volumes owe their existence.\r\n\r\nI imagine I trace this latter bequest to a visit I paid the Sage, if so\r\nI may be permitted to call him, a few weeks before his death.\r\n\r\nAlthough he read little of our modern literature, my friend, with the\r\naffable good-nature which belonged to him, graciously permitted me\r\nto consult him upon various literary undertakings meditated by the\r\ndesultory ambition of a young and inexperienced student. And at that\r\ntime I sought his advice upon a work of imagination, intended to depict\r\nthe effects of enthusiasm upon different modifications of character.\r\nHe listened to my conception, which was sufficiently trite and\r\nprosaic, with his usual patience; and then, thoughtfully turning to his\r\nbookshelves, took down an old volume, and read to me, first, in Greek,\r\nand secondly, in English, some extracts to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n“Plato here expresses four kinds of mania, by which I desire to\r\nunderstand enthusiasm and the inspiration of the gods: Firstly, the\r\nmusical; secondly, the telestic or mystic; thirdly, the prophetic; and\r\nfourthly, that which belongs to love.”\r\n\r\nThe author he quoted, after contending that there is something in the\r\nsoul above intellect, and stating that there are in our nature distinct\r\nenergies,--by the one of which we discover and seize, as it were,\r\non sciences and theorems with almost intuitive rapidity, by\r\nanother, through which high art is accomplished, like the statues of\r\nPhidias,--proceeded to state that “enthusiasm, in the true acceptation\r\nof the word, is, when that part of the soul which is above intellect is\r\nexcited to the gods, and thence derives its inspiration.”\r\n\r\nThe author, then pursuing his comment upon Plato, observes, that “one of\r\nthese manias may suffice (especially that which belongs to love) to lead\r\nback the soul to its first divinity and happiness; but that there is\r\nan intimate union with them all; and that the ordinary progress through\r\nwhich the soul ascends is, primarily, through the musical; next, through\r\nthe telestic or mystic; thirdly, through the prophetic; and lastly,\r\nthrough the enthusiasm of love.”\r\n\r\nWhile with a bewildered understanding and a reluctant attention I\r\nlistened to these intricate sublimities, my adviser closed the volume,\r\nand said with complacency, “There is the motto for your book,--the\r\nthesis for your theme.”\r\n\r\n“Davus sum, non Oedipus,” said I, shaking my head, discontentedly.\r\n“All this may be exceedingly fine, but, Heaven forgive me,--I don’t\r\nunderstand a word of it. The mysteries of your Rosicrucians, and your\r\nfraternities, are mere child’s play to the jargon of the Platonists.”\r\n\r\n“Yet, not till you rightly understand this passage, can you understand\r\nthe higher theories of the Rosicrucians, or of the still nobler\r\nfraternities you speak of with so much levity.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if that be the case, I give up in despair. Why not, since you are\r\nso well versed in the matter, take the motto for a book of your own?”\r\n\r\n“But if I have already composed a book with that thesis for its theme,\r\nwill you prepare it for the public?”\r\n\r\n“With the greatest pleasure,” said I,--alas, too rashly!\r\n\r\n“I shall hold you to your promise,” returned the old gentleman, “and\r\nwhen I am no more, you will receive the manuscripts. From what you say\r\nof the prevailing taste in literature, I cannot flatter you with\r\nthe hope that you will gain much by the undertaking. And I tell you\r\nbeforehand that you will find it not a little laborious.”\r\n\r\n“Is your work a romance?”\r\n\r\n“It is a romance, and it is not a romance. It is a truth for those who\r\ncan comprehend it, and an extravagance for those who cannot.”\r\n\r\nAt last there arrived the manuscripts, with a brief note from my\r\ndeceased friend, reminding me of my imprudent promise.\r\n\r\nWith mournful interest, and yet with eager impatience, I opened the\r\npacket and trimmed my lamp. Conceive my dismay when I found the whole\r\nwritten in an unintelligible cipher. I present the reader with a\r\nspecimen:\r\n\r\n(Several strange characters.)\r\n\r\nand so on for nine hundred and forty mortal pages in foolscap. I could\r\nscarcely believe my eyes: in fact, I began to think the lamp burned\r\nsingularly blue; and sundry misgivings as to the unhallowed nature\r\nof the characters I had so unwittingly opened upon, coupled with the\r\nstrange hints and mystical language of the old gentleman, crept through\r\nmy disordered imagination. Certainly, to say no worse of it, the whole\r\nthing looked UNCANNY! I was about, precipitately, to hurry the papers\r\ninto my desk, with a pious determination to have nothing more to do with\r\nthem, when my eye fell upon a book, neatly bound in blue morocco, and\r\nwhich, in my eagerness, I had hitherto overlooked. I opened this volume\r\nwith great precaution, not knowing what might jump out, and--guess\r\nmy delight--found that it contained a key or dictionary to the\r\nhieroglyphics. Not to weary the reader with an account of my labours,\r\nI am contented with saying that at last I imagined myself capable of\r\nconstruing the characters, and set to work in good earnest. Still it was\r\nno easy task, and two years elapsed before I had made much progress. I\r\nthen, by way of experiment on the public, obtained the insertion of a\r\nfew desultory chapters, in a periodical with which, for a few months, I\r\nhad the honour to be connected. They appeared to excite more curiosity\r\nthan I had presumed to anticipate; and I renewed, with better heart, my\r\nlaborious undertaking. But now a new misfortune befell me: I found, as\r\nI proceeded, that the author had made two copies of his work, one much\r\nmore elaborate and detailed than the other; I had stumbled upon the\r\nearlier copy, and had my whole task to remodel, and the chapters I had\r\nwritten to retranslate. I may say then, that, exclusive of intervals\r\ndevoted to more pressing occupations, my unlucky promise cost me the\r\ntoil of several years before I could bring it to adequate fulfilment.\r\nThe task was the more difficult, since the style in the original is\r\nwritten in a kind of rhythmical prose, as if the author desired that in\r\nsome degree his work should be regarded as one of poetical conception\r\nand design. To this it was not possible to do justice, and in the\r\nattempt I have doubtless very often need of the reader’s indulgent\r\nconsideration. My natural respect for the old gentleman’s vagaries,\r\nwith a muse of equivocal character, must be my only excuse whenever\r\nthe language, without luxuriating into verse, borrows flowers scarcely\r\nnatural to prose. Truth compels me also to confess, that, with all\r\nmy pains, I am by no means sure that I have invariably given the true\r\nmeaning of the cipher; nay, that here and there either a gap in the\r\nnarrative, or the sudden assumption of a new cipher, to which no key was\r\nafforded, has obliged me to resort to interpolations of my own, no doubt\r\neasily discernible, but which, I flatter myself, are not inharmonious to\r\nthe general design. This confession leads me to the sentence with\r\nwhich I shall conclude: If, reader, in this book there be anything that\r\npleases you, it is certainly mine; but whenever you come to something\r\nyou dislike,--lay the blame upon the old gentleman!\r\n\r\nLondon, January, 1842.\r\n\r\nN.B.--The notes appended to the text are sometimes by the author,\r\nsometimes by the editor.

Lib.,” canto ii. xiv.-xviii.\r\n\r\n     (She was a virgin of a glorious beauty, but regarded not her\r\n     beauty...Negligence itself is art in those favoured by Nature, by\r\n     love, and by the heavens.)\r\n\r\nAt Naples, in the latter half of the last century, a worthy artist named\r\nGaetano Pisani lived and flourished. He was a musician of great genius,\r\nbut not of popular reputation; there was in all his compositions\r\nsomething capricious and fantastic which did not please the taste of the\r\nDilettanti of Naples. He was fond of unfamiliar subjects into which he\r\nintroduced airs and symphonies that excited a kind of terror in those\r\nwho listened. The names of his pieces will probably suggest their\r\nnature. I find, for instance, among his MSS., these titles: “The Feast\r\nof the Harpies,” “The Witches at Benevento,” “The Descent of Orpheus\r\ninto Hades,” “The Evil Eye,” “The Eumenides,” and many others\r\nthat evince a powerful imagination delighting in the fearful and\r\nsupernatural, but often relieved by an airy and delicate fancy with\r\npassages of exquisite grace and beauty. It is true that in the selection\r\nof his subjects from ancient fable, Gaetano Pisani was much more\r\nfaithful than his contemporaries to the remote origin and the early\r\ngenius of Italian Opera.\r\n\r\nThat descendant, however effeminate, of the ancient union between Song\r\nand Drama, when, after long obscurity and dethronement, it regained a\r\npunier sceptre, though a gaudier purple, by the banks of the Etrurian\r\nArno, or amidst the lagunes of Venice, had chosen all its primary\r\ninspirations from the unfamiliar and classic sources of heathen legend;\r\nand Pisani’s “Descent of Orpheus” was but a bolder, darker, and more\r\nscientific repetition of the “Euridice” which Jacopi Peri set to music\r\nat the august nuptials of Henry of Navarre and Mary of Medicis.* Still,\r\nas I have said, the style of the Neapolitan musician was not on the\r\nwhole pleasing to ears grown nice and euphuistic in the more dulcet\r\nmelodies of the day; and faults and extravagances easily discernible,\r\nand often to appearance wilful, served the critics for an excuse for\r\ntheir distaste. Fortunately, or the poor musician might have starved,\r\nhe was not only a composer, but also an excellent practical performer,\r\nespecially on the violin, and by that instrument he earned a decent\r\nsubsistence as one of the orchestra at the Great Theatre of San Carlo.\r\nHere formal and appointed tasks necessarily kept his eccentric fancies\r\nin tolerable check, though it is recorded that no less than five times\r\nhe had been deposed from his desk for having shocked the conoscenti,\r\nand thrown the whole band into confusion, by impromptu variations of so\r\nfrantic and startling a nature that one might well have imagined that\r\nthe harpies or witches who inspired his compositions had clawed hold of\r\nhis instrument.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility, however, to find any one of equal excellence as a\r\nperformer (that is to say, in his more lucid and orderly moments) had\r\nforced his reinstalment, and he had now, for the most part, reconciled\r\nhimself to the narrow sphere of his appointed adagios or allegros. The\r\naudience, too, aware of his propensity, were quick to perceive the least\r\ndeviation from the text; and if he wandered for a moment, which\r\nmight also be detected by the eye as well as the ear, in some strange\r\ncontortion of visage, and some ominous flourish of his bow, a gentle and\r\nadmonitory murmur recalled the musician from his Elysium or his Tartarus\r\nto the sober regions of his desk. Then he would start as if from a\r\ndream, cast a hurried, frightened, apologetic glance around, and, with\r\na crestfallen, humbled air, draw his rebellious instrument back to the\r\nbeaten track of the glib monotony. But at home he would make himself\r\namends for this reluctant drudgery. And there, grasping the unhappy\r\nviolin with ferocious fingers, he would pour forth, often till the\r\nmorning rose, strange, wild measures that would startle the early\r\nfisherman on the shore below with a superstitious awe, and make him\r\ncross himself as if mermaid or sprite had wailed no earthly music in his\r\near.\r\n\r\n     (*Orpheus was the favourite hero of early Italian Opera, or\r\n     Lyrical Drama. The Orfeo of Angelo Politiano was produced in\r\n     1475. The Orfeo of Monteverde was performed at Venice in\r\n     1667.)\r\n\r\nThis man’s appearance was in keeping with the characteristics of his\r\nart. The features were noble and striking, but worn and haggard,\r\nwith black, careless locks tangled into a maze of curls, and a fixed,\r\nspeculative, dreamy stare in his large and hollow eyes. All his\r\nmovements were peculiar, sudden, and abrupt, as the impulse seized him;\r\nand in gliding through the streets, or along the beach, he was heard\r\nlaughing and talking to himself. Withal, he was a harmless, guileless,\r\ngentle creature, and would share his mite with any idle lazzaroni, whom\r\nhe often paused to contemplate as they lay lazily basking in the sun.\r\nYet was he thoroughly unsocial. He formed no friends, flattered no\r\npatrons, resorted to none of the merry-makings so dear to the children\r\nof music and the South. He and his art seemed alone suited to each\r\nother,--both quaint, primitive, unworldly, irregular. You could not\r\nseparate the man from his music; it was himself. Without it he was\r\nnothing, a mere machine! WITH it, he was king over worlds of his own.\r\nPoor man, he had little enough in this! At a manufacturing town in\r\nEngland there is a gravestone on which the epitaph records “one Claudius\r\nPhillips, whose absolute contempt for riches, and inimitable performance\r\non the violin, made him the admiration of all that knew him!” Logical\r\nconjunction of opposite eulogies! In proportion, O Genius, to thy\r\ncontempt for riches will be thy performance on thy violin!\r\n\r\nGaetano Pisani’s talents as a composer had been chiefly exhibited\r\nin music appropriate to this his favourite instrument, of all\r\nunquestionably the most various and royal in its resources and power\r\nover the passions. As Shakespeare among poets is the Cremona among\r\ninstruments. Nevertheless, he had composed other pieces of larger\r\nambition and wider accomplishment, and chief of these, his precious, his\r\nunpurchased, his unpublished, his unpublishable and imperishable opera\r\nof the “Siren.” This great work had been the dream of his boyhood, the\r\nmistress of his manhood; in advancing age “it stood beside him like\r\nhis youth.” Vainly had he struggled to place it before the world. Even\r\nbland, unjealous Paisiello, Maestro di Capella, shook his gentle head\r\nwhen the musician favoured him with a specimen of one of his most\r\nthrilling scenas. And yet, Paisiello, though that music differs from all\r\nDurante taught thee to emulate, there may--but patience, Gaetano Pisani!\r\nbide thy time, and keep thy violin in tune!\r\n\r\nStrange as it may appear to the fairer reader, this grotesque personage\r\nhad yet formed those ties which ordinary mortals are apt to consider\r\ntheir especial monopoly,--he was married, and had one child. What is\r\nmore strange yet, his wife was a daughter of quiet, sober, unfantastic\r\nEngland: she was much younger than himself; she was fair and gentle,\r\nwith a sweet English face; she had married him from choice, and (will\r\nyou believe it?) she yet loved him. How she came to marry him, or how\r\nthis shy, unsocial, wayward creature ever ventured to propose, I can\r\nonly explain by asking you to look round and explain first to ME how\r\nhalf the husbands and half the wives you meet ever found a mate! Yet, on\r\nreflection, this union was not so extraordinary after all. The girl was\r\na natural child of parents too noble ever to own and claim her. She was\r\nbrought into Italy to learn the art by which she was to live, for she\r\nhad taste and voice; she was a dependant and harshly treated, and poor\r\nPisani was her master, and his voice the only one she had heard from\r\nher cradle that seemed without one tone that could scorn or chide. And\r\nso--well, is the rest natural? Natural or not, they married. This young\r\nwife loved her husband; and young and gentle as she was, she might\r\nalmost be said to be the protector of the two. From how many disgraces\r\nwith the despots of San Carlo and the Conservatorio had her unknown\r\nofficious mediation saved him! In how many ailments--for his frame was\r\nweak--had she nursed and tended him! Often, in the dark nights, she\r\nwould wait at the theatre with her lantern to light him and her steady\r\narm to lean on; otherwise, in his abstract reveries, who knows but the\r\nmusician would have walked after his “Siren” into the sea! And then she\r\nwould so patiently, perhaps (for in true love there is not always the\r\nfinest taste) so DELIGHTEDLY, listen to those storms of eccentric and\r\nfitful melody, and steal him--whispering praises all the way--from the\r\nunwholesome night-watch to rest and sleep!\r\n\r\nI said his music was a part of the man, and this gentle creature seemed\r\na part of the music; it was, in fact, when she sat beside him that\r\nwhatever was tender or fairy-like in his motley fantasia crept into the\r\nharmony as by stealth. Doubtless her presence acted on the music, and\r\nshaped and softened it; but, he, who never examined how or what his\r\ninspiration, knew it not. All that he knew was, that he loved and\r\nblessed her. He fancied he told her so twenty times a day; but he never\r\ndid, for he was not of many words, even to his wife. His language\r\nwas his music,--as hers, her cares! He was more communicative to his\r\nbarbiton, as the learned Mersennus teaches us to call all the varieties\r\nof the great viol family. Certainly barbiton sounds better than\r\nfiddle; and barbiton let it be. He would talk to THAT by the hour\r\ntogether,--praise it, scold it, coax it, nay (for such is man, even the\r\nmost guileless), he had been known to swear at it; but for that excess\r\nhe was always penitentially remorseful. And the barbiton had a tongue of\r\nhis own, could take his own part, and when HE also scolded, had much\r\nthe best of it. He was a noble fellow, this Violin!--a Tyrolese, the\r\nhandiwork of the illustrious Steiner. There was something mysterious in\r\nhis great age. How many hands, now dust, had awakened his strings ere\r\nhe became the Robin Goodfellow and Familiar of Gaetano Pisani! His very\r\ncase was venerable,--beautifully painted, it was said, by Caracci. An\r\nEnglish collector had offered more for the case than Pisani had ever\r\nmade by the violin. But Pisani, who cared not if he had inhabited a\r\ncabin himself, was proud of a palace for the barbiton. His barbiton, it\r\nwas his elder child! He had another child, and now we must turn to her.\r\n\r\nHow shall I describe thee, Viola? Certainly the music had something to\r\nanswer for in the advent of that young stranger. For both in her form\r\nand her character you might have traced a family likeness to that\r\nsingular and spirit-like life of sound which night after night threw\r\nitself in airy and goblin sport over the starry seas...Beautiful\r\nshe was, but of a very uncommon beauty,--a combination, a harmony of\r\nopposite attributes. Her hair of a gold richer and purer than that\r\nwhich is seen even in the North; but the eyes, of all the dark, tender,\r\nsubduing light of more than Italian--almost of Oriental--splendour. The\r\ncomplexion exquisitely fair, but never the same,--vivid in one moment,\r\npale the next. And with the complexion, the expression also varied;\r\nnothing now so sad, and nothing now so joyous.\r\n\r\nI grieve to say that what we rightly entitle education was much\r\nneglected for their daughter by this singular pair. To be sure, neither\r\nof them had much knowledge to bestow; and knowledge was not then the\r\nfashion, as it is now. But accident or nature favoured young Viola. She\r\nlearned, as of course, her mother’s language with her father’s. And she\r\ncontrived soon to read and to write; and her mother, who, by the\r\nway, was a Roman Catholic, taught her betimes to pray. But then, to\r\ncounteract all these acquisitions, the strange habits of Pisani, and the\r\nincessant watch and care which he required from his wife, often left the\r\nchild alone with an old nurse, who, to be sure, loved her dearly, but\r\nwho was in no way calculated to instruct her.\r\n\r\nDame Gionetta was every inch Italian and Neapolitan. Her youth had been\r\nall love, and her age was all superstition. She was garrulous, fond,--a\r\ngossip. Now she would prattle to the girl of cavaliers and princes at\r\nher feet, and now she would freeze her blood with tales and legends,\r\nperhaps as old as Greek or Etrurian fable, of demon and vampire,--of the\r\ndances round the great walnut-tree at Benevento, and the haunting spell\r\nof the Evil Eye. All this helped silently to weave charmed webs over\r\nViola’s imagination that afterthought and later years might labour\r\nvainly to dispel. And all this especially fitted her to hang, with a\r\nfearful joy, upon her father’s music. Those visionary strains, ever\r\nstruggling to translate into wild and broken sounds the language of\r\nunearthly beings, breathed around her from her birth. Thus you might\r\nhave said that her whole mind was full of music; associations, memories,\r\nsensations of pleasure or pain,--all were mixed up inexplicably with\r\nthose sounds that now delighted and now terrified; that greeted her when\r\nher eyes opened to the sun, and woke her trembling on her lonely couch\r\nin the darkness of the night. The legends and tales of Gionetta only\r\nserved to make the child better understand the signification of those\r\nmysterious tones; they furnished her with words to the music. It was\r\nnatural that the daughter of such a parent should soon evince some taste\r\nin his art. But this developed itself chiefly in the ear and the voice.\r\nShe was yet a child when she sang divinely. A great Cardinal--great\r\nalike in the State and the Conservatorio--heard of her gifts, and sent\r\nfor her. From that moment her fate was decided: she was to be the future\r\nglory of Naples, the prima donna of San Carlo.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal insisted upon the accomplishment of his own predictions,\r\nand provided her with the most renowned masters. To inspire her with\r\nemulation, his Eminence took her one evening to his own box: it would\r\nbe something to see the performance, something more to hear the applause\r\nlavished upon the glittering signoras she was hereafter to excel! Oh,\r\nhow gloriously that life of the stage, that fairy world of music and\r\nsong, dawned upon her! It was the only world that seemed to correspond\r\nwith her strange childish thoughts. It appeared to her as if, cast\r\nhitherto on a foreign shore, she was brought at last to see the forms\r\nand hear the language of her native land. Beautiful and true enthusiasm,\r\nrich with the promise of genius! Boy or man, thou wilt never be a poet,\r\nif thou hast not felt the ideal, the romance, the Calypso’s isle that\r\nopened to thee when for the first time the magic curtain was drawn\r\naside, and let in the world of poetry on the world of prose!\r\n\r\nAnd now the initiation was begun. She was to read, to study, to depict\r\nby a gesture, a look, the passions she was to delineate on the boards;\r\nlessons dangerous, in truth, to some, but not to the pure enthusiasm\r\nthat comes from art; for the mind that rightly conceives art is but\r\na mirror which gives back what is cast on its surface faithfully\r\nonly--while unsullied. She seized on nature and truth intuitively. Her\r\nrecitations became full of unconscious power; her voice moved the heart\r\nto tears, or warmed it into generous rage. But this arose from that\r\nsympathy which genius ever has, even in its earliest innocence, with\r\nwhatever feels, or aspires, or suffers.\r\n\r\nIt was no premature woman comprehending the love or the jealousy that\r\nthe words expressed; her art was one of those strange secrets which\r\nthe psychologists may unriddle to us if they please, and tell us why\r\nchildren of the simplest minds and the purest hearts are often so acute\r\nto distinguish, in the tales you tell them, or the songs you sing, the\r\ndifference between the true art and the false, passion and jargon, Homer\r\nand Racine,--echoing back, from hearts that have not yet felt what they\r\nrepeat, the melodious accents of the natural pathos. Apart from\r\nher studies, Viola was a simple, affectionate, but somewhat wayward\r\nchild,--wayward, not in temper, for that was sweet and docile; but in\r\nher moods, which, as I before hinted, changed from sad to gay and gay to\r\nsad without an apparent cause. If cause there were, it must be traced to\r\nthe early and mysterious influences I have referred to, when seeking to\r\nexplain the effect produced on her imagination by those restless streams\r\nof sound that constantly played around it; for it is noticeable that to\r\nthose who are much alive to the effects of music, airs and tunes often\r\ncome back, in the commonest pursuits of life, to vex, as it were, and\r\nhaunt them. The music, once admitted to the soul, becomes also a sort\r\nof spirit, and never dies. It wanders perturbedly through the halls and\r\ngalleries of the memory, and is often heard again, distinct and living\r\nas when it first displaced the wavelets of the air. Now at times, then,\r\nthese phantoms of sound floated back upon her fancy; if gay, to call\r\na smile from every dimple; if mournful, to throw a shade upon her\r\nbrow,--to make her cease from her childishmirth, and sit apart and muse.\r\n\r\nRightly, then, in a typical sense, might this fair creature, so airy in\r\nher shape, so harmonious in her beauty, so unfamiliar in her ways and\r\nthoughts,--rightly might she be called a daughter, less of the musician\r\nthan the music, a being for whom you could imagine that some fate was\r\nreserved, less of actual life than the romance which, to eyes that can\r\nsee, and hearts that can feel, glides ever along WITH the actual life,\r\nstream by stream, to the Dark Ocean.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore it seemed not strange that Viola herself, even in\r\nchildhood, and yet more as she bloomed into the sweet seriousness of\r\nvirgin youth, should fancy her life ordained for a lot, whether of bliss\r\nor woe, that should accord with the romance and reverie which made the\r\natmosphere she breathed. Frequently she would climb through the thickets\r\nthat clothed the neighbouring grotto of Posilipo,--the mighty work of\r\nthe old Cimmerians,--and, seated by the haunted Tomb of Virgil, indulge\r\nthose visions, the subtle vagueness of which no poetry can render\r\npalpable and defined; for the Poet that surpasses all who ever sang, is\r\nthe heart of dreaming youth! Frequently there, too, beside the threshold\r\nover which the vine-leaves clung, and facing that dark-blue, waveless\r\nsea, she would sit in the autumn noon or summer twilight, and build her\r\ncastles in the air. Who doth not do the same,--not in youth alone, but\r\nwith the dimmed hopes of age! It is man’s prerogative to dream, the\r\ncommon royalty of peasant and of king. But those day-dreams of hers were\r\nmore habitual, distinct, and solemn than the greater part of us indulge.\r\nThey seemed like the Orama of the Greeks,--prophets while phantasma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.II.\r\n\r\n     Fu stupor, fu vaghezza, fu diletto!\r\n     “Gerusal. Lib.,” cant. ii. xxi.\r\n\r\n     (“Desire it was, ‘t was wonder, ‘t was delight.”\r\n      Wiffen’s Translation.)\r\n\r\nNow at last the education is accomplished! Viola is nearly sixteen.\r\nThe Cardinal declares that the time is come when the new name must be\r\ninscribed in the Libro d’Oro,--the Golden Book set apart to the children\r\nof Art and Song. Yes, but in what character?--to whose genius is she\r\nto give embodiment and form? Ah, there is the secret! Rumours go abroad\r\nthat the inexhaustible Paisiello, charmed with her performance of his\r\n“Nel cor piu non me sento,” and his “Io son Lindoro,” will produce some\r\nnew masterpiece to introduce the debutante. Others insist upon it that\r\nher forte is the comic, and that Cimarosa is hard at work at another\r\n“Matrimonia Segreto.” But in the meanwhile there is a check in the\r\ndiplomacy somewhere. The Cardinal is observed to be out of humour. He\r\nhas said publicly,--and the words are portentous,--“The silly girl is\r\nas mad as her father; what she asks is preposterous!” Conference follows\r\nconference; the Cardinal talks to the poor child very solemnly in\r\nhis closet,--all in vain. Naples is distracted with curiosity and\r\nconjecture. The lecture ends in a quarrel, and Viola comes home sullen\r\nand pouting: she will not act,--she has renounced the engagement.\r\n\r\nPisani, too inexperienced to be aware of all the dangers of the stage,\r\nhad been pleased at the notion that one, at least, of his name would add\r\ncelebrity to his art. The girl’s perverseness displeased him. However,\r\nhe said nothing,--he never scolded in words, but he took up the faithful\r\nbarbiton. Oh, faithful barbiton, how horribly thou didst scold! It\r\nscreeched, it gabbled, it moaned, it growled. And Viola’s eyes filled\r\nwith tears, for she understood that language. She stole to her mother,\r\nand whispered in her ear; and when Pisani turned from his employment,\r\nlo! both mother and daughter were weeping. He looked at them with a\r\nwondering stare; and then, as if he felt he had been harsh, he flew\r\nagain to his Familiar. And now you thought you heard the lullaby which a\r\nfairy might sing to some fretful changeling it had adopted and sought to\r\nsoothe. Liquid, low, silvery, streamed the tones beneath the enchanted\r\nbow. The most stubborn grief would have paused to hear; and withal,\r\nat times, out came a wild, merry, ringing note, like a laugh, but not\r\nmortal laughter. It was one of his most successful airs from his beloved\r\nopera,--the Siren in the act of charming the waves and the winds to\r\nsleep. Heaven knows what next would have come, but his arm was arrested.\r\nViola had thrown herself on his breast, and kissed him, with happy\r\neyes that smiled through her sunny hair. At that very moment the door\r\nopened,--a message from the Cardinal. Viola must go to his Eminence at\r\nonce. Her mother went with her. All was reconciled and settled; Viola\r\nhad her way, and selected her own opera. O ye dull nations of the North,\r\nwith your broils and debates,--your bustling lives of the Pnyx and\r\nthe Agora!--you cannot guess what a stir throughout musical Naples was\r\noccasioned by the rumour of a new opera and a new singer. But whose\r\nthe opera? No cabinet intrigue ever was so secret. Pisani came back one\r\nnight from the theatre, evidently disturbed and irate. Woe to thine ears\r\nhadst thou heard the barbiton that night! They had suspended him from\r\nhis office,--they feared that the new opera, and the first debut of\r\nhis daughter as prima donna, would be too much for his nerves. And his\r\nvariations, his diablerie of sirens and harpies, on such a night, made\r\na hazard not to be contemplated without awe. To be set aside, and on the\r\nvery night that his child, whose melody was but an emanation of his own,\r\nwas to perform,--set aside for some new rival: it was too much for a\r\nmusician’s flesh and blood. For the first time he spoke in words upon\r\nthe subject, and gravely asked--for that question the barbiton, eloquent\r\nas it was, could not express distinctly--what was to be the opera, and\r\nwhat the part? And Viola as gravely answered that she was pledged to the\r\nCardinal not to reveal. Pisani said nothing, but disappeared with\r\nthe violin; and presently they heard the Familiar from the house-top\r\n(whither, when thoroughly out of humour, the musician sometimes fled),\r\nwhining and sighing as if its heart were broken.\r\n\r\nThe affections of Pisani were little visible on the surface. He was not\r\none of those fond, caressing fathers whose children are ever playing\r\nround their knees; his mind and soul were so thoroughly in his art that\r\ndomestic life glided by him, seemingly as if THAT were a dream, and\r\nthe heart the substantial form and body of existence. Persons\r\nmuch cultivating an abstract study are often thus; mathematicians\r\nproverbially so. When his servant ran to the celebrated French\r\nphilosopher, shrieking, “The house is on fire, sir!” “Go and tell my\r\nwife then, fool!” said the wise man, settling back to his problems;\r\n“do _I_ ever meddle with domestic affairs?” But what are mathematics to\r\nmusic--music, that not only composes operas, but plays on the barbiton?\r\nDo you know what the illustrious Giardini said when the tyro asked how\r\nlong it would take to learn to play on the violin? Hear, and despair, ye\r\nwho would bend the bow to which that of Ulysses was a plaything, “Twelve\r\nhours a day for twenty years together!” Can a man, then, who plays the\r\nbarbiton be always playing also with his little ones? No, Pisani; often,\r\nwith the keen susceptibility of childhood, poor Viola had stolen from\r\nthe room to weep at the thought that thou didst not love her. And yet,\r\nunderneath this outward abstraction of the artist, the natural fondness\r\nflowed all the same; and as she grew up, the dreamer had understood the\r\ndreamer. And now, shut out from all fame himself; to be forbidden to\r\nhail even his daughter’s fame!--and that daughter herself to be in\r\nthe conspiracy against him! Sharper than the serpent’s tooth was the\r\ningratitude, and sharper than the serpent’s tooth was the wail of the\r\npitying barbiton!\r\n\r\nThe eventful hour is come. Viola is gone to the theatre,--her mother\r\nwith her. The indignant musician remains at home. Gionetta bursts into\r\nthe room: my Lord Cardinal’s carriage is at the door,--the Padrone is\r\nsent for. He must lay aside his violin; he must put on his brocade coat\r\nand his lace ruffles. Here they are,--quick, quick! And quick rolls the\r\ngilded coach, and majestic sits the driver, and statelily prance the\r\nsteeds. Poor Pisani is lost in a mist of uncomfortable amaze. He arrives\r\nat the theatre; he descends at the great door; he turns round and\r\nround, and looks about him and about: he misses something,--where is the\r\nviolin? Alas! his soul, his voice, his self of self, is left behind! It\r\nis but an automaton that the lackeys conduct up the stairs, through the\r\ntier, into the Cardinal’s box. But then, what bursts upon him! Does he\r\ndream? The first act is over (they did not send for him till success\r\nseemed no longer doubtful); the first act has decided all. He feels THAT\r\nby the electric sympathy which ever the one heart has at once with\r\na vast audience. He feels it by the breathless stillness of that\r\nmultitude; he feels it even by the lifted finger of the Cardinal. He\r\nsees his Viola on the stage, radiant in her robes and gems,--he hears\r\nher voice thrilling through the single heart of the thousands! But the\r\nscene, the part, the music! It is his other child,--his immortal child;\r\nthe spirit-infant of his soul; his darling of many years of patient\r\nobscurity and pining genius; his masterpiece; his opera of the Siren!\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the mystery that had so galled him,--this the cause of\r\nthe quarrel with the Cardinal; this the secret not to be proclaimed till\r\nthe success was won, and the daughter had united her father’s triumph\r\nwith her own! And there she stands, as all souls bow before her,--fairer\r\nthan the very Siren he had called from the deeps of melody. Oh, long and\r\nsweet recompense of toil! Where is on earth the rapture like that which\r\nis known to genius when at last it bursts from its hidden cavern into\r\nlight and fame!\r\n\r\nHe did not speak, he did not move; he stood transfixed, breathless, the\r\ntears rolling down his cheeks; only from time to time his hands still\r\nwandered about,--mechanically they sought for the faithful instrument,\r\nwhy was it not there to share his triumph?\r\n\r\nAt last the curtain fell; but on such a storm and diapason of applause!\r\nUp rose the audience as one man, as with one voice that dear name was\r\nshouted. She came on, trembling, pale, and in the whole crowd saw but\r\nher father’s face. The audience followed those moistened eyes; they\r\nrecognised with a thrill the daughter’s impulse and her meaning. The\r\ngood old Cardinal drew him gently forward. Wild musician, thy daughter\r\nhas given thee back more than the life thou gavest!\r\n\r\n“My poor violin!” said he, wiping his eyes, “they will never hiss thee\r\nagain now!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.III.\r\n\r\n     Fra si contrarie tempre in ghiaccio e in foco,\r\n     In riso e in pianto, e fra paura e speme\r\n     L’ingannatrice Donna--\r\n     “Gerusal. Lib.,” cant. iv. xciv.\r\n\r\n     (Between such contrarious mixtures of ice and fire, laughter and\r\n     tears,--fear and hope, the deceiving dame.)\r\n\r\nNow notwithstanding the triumph both of the singer and the opera, there\r\nhad been one moment in the first act, and, consequently, BEFORE the\r\narrival of Pisani, when the scale seemed more than doubtful. It was in a\r\nchorus replete with all the peculiarities of the composer. And when the\r\nMaelstrom of Capricci whirled and foamed, and tore ear and sense through\r\nevery variety of sound, the audience simultaneously recognised the\r\nhand of Pisani. A title had been given to the opera which had hitherto\r\nprevented all suspicion of its parentage; and the overture and opening,\r\nin which the music had been regular and sweet, had led the audience\r\nto fancy they detected the genius of their favourite Paisiello. Long\r\naccustomed to ridicule and almost to despise the pretensions of Pisani\r\nas a composer, they now felt as if they had been unduly cheated into\r\nthe applause with which they had hailed the overture and the commencing\r\nscenas. An ominous buzz circulated round the house: the singers,\r\nthe orchestra,--electrically sensitive to the impression of the\r\naudience,--grew, themselves, agitated and dismayed, and failed in the\r\nenergy and precision which could alone carry off the grotesqueness of\r\nthe music.\r\n\r\nThere are always in every theatre many rivals to a new author and a new\r\nperformer,--a party impotent while all goes well, but a dangerous ambush\r\nthe instant some accident throws into confusion the march of success. A\r\nhiss arose; it was partial, it is true, but the significant silence of\r\nall applause seemed to forebode the coming moment when the displeasure\r\nwould grow contagious. It was the breath that stirred the impending\r\navalanche. At that critical moment Viola, the Siren queen, emerged for\r\nthe first time from her ocean cave. As she came forward to the\r\nlamps, the novelty of her situation, the chilling apathy of the\r\naudience,--which even the sight of so singular a beauty did not at the\r\nfirst arouse,--the whispers of the malignant singers on the stage, the\r\nglare of the lights, and more--far more than the rest--that recent hiss,\r\nwhich had reached her in her concealment, all froze up her faculties and\r\nsuspended her voice. And, instead of the grand invocation into which\r\nshe ought rapidly to have burst, the regal Siren, retransformed into\r\nthe trembling girl, stood pale and mute before the stern, cold array of\r\nthose countless eyes.\r\n\r\nAt that instant, and when consciousness itself seemed about to fail her,\r\nas she turned a timid beseeching glance around the still multitude, she\r\nperceived, in a box near the stage, a countenance which at once, and\r\nlike magic, produced on her mind an effect never to be analysed\r\nnor forgotten. It was one that awakened an indistinct, haunting\r\nreminiscence, as if she had seen it in those day-dreams she had been so\r\nwont from infancy to indulge. She could not withdraw her gaze from that\r\nface, and as she gazed, the awe and coldness that had before seized her,\r\nvanished like a mist from before the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the dark splendour of the eyes that met her own there was indeed\r\nso much of gentle encouragement, of benign and compassionate\r\nadmiration,--so much that warmed, and animated, and nerved,--that any\r\none, actor or orator, who has ever observed the effect that a single\r\nearnest and kindly look in the crowd that is to be addressed and won,\r\nwill produce upon his mind, may readily account for the sudden and\r\ninspiriting influence which the eye and smile of the stranger exercised\r\non the debutante.\r\n\r\nAnd while yet she gazed, and the glow returned to her heart, the\r\nstranger half rose, as if to recall the audience to a sense of the\r\ncourtesy due to one so fair and young; and the instant his voice gave\r\nthe signal, the audience followed it by a burst of generous applause.\r\nFor this stranger himself was a marked personage, and his recent arrival\r\nat Naples had divided with the new opera the gossip of the city. And\r\nthen as the applause ceased, clear, full, and freed from every fetter,\r\nlike a spirit from the clay, the Siren’s voice poured forth its\r\nentrancing music. From that time Viola forgot the crowd, the hazard,\r\nthe whole world,--except the fairy one over with she presided. It seemed\r\nthat the stranger’s presence only served still more to heighten that\r\ndelusion, in which the artist sees no creation without the circle of his\r\nart, she felt as if that serene brow, and those brilliant eyes, inspired\r\nher with powers never known before: and, as if searching for a language\r\nto express the strange sensations occasioned by his presence, that\r\npresence itself whispered to her the melody and the song.\r\n\r\nOnly when all was over, and she saw her father and felt his joy, did\r\nthis wild spell vanish before the sweeter one of the household and\r\nfilial love. Yet again, as she turned from the stage, she looked back\r\ninvoluntarily, and the stranger’s calm and half-melancholy smile sank\r\ninto her heart,--to live there, to be recalled with confused memories,\r\nhalf of pleasure, and half of pain.\r\n\r\nPass over the congratulations of the good Cardinal-Virtuoso, astonished\r\nat finding himself and all Naples had been hitherto in the wrong on\r\na subject of taste,--still more astonished at finding himself and all\r\nNaples combining to confess it; pass over the whispered ecstasies of\r\nadmiration which buzzed in the singer’s ear, as once more, in her modest\r\nveil and quiet dress, she escaped from the crowd of gallants that choked\r\nup every avenue behind the scenes; pass over the sweet embrace of father\r\nand child, returning through the starlit streets and along the deserted\r\nChiaja in the Cardinal’s carriage; never pause now to note the tears and\r\nejaculations of the good, simple-hearted mother,--see them returned;\r\nsee the well-known room, venimus ad larem nostrum (We come to our own\r\nhouse.); see old Gionetta bustling at the supper; and hear Pisani, as he\r\nrouses the barbiton from its case, communicating all that has happened\r\nto the intelligent Familiar; hark to the mother’s merry, low, English\r\nlaugh. Why, Viola, strange child, sittest thou apart, thy face leaning\r\non thy fair hands, thine eyes fixed on space? Up, rouse thee! Every\r\ndimple on the cheek of home must smile to-night. (“Ridete quidquid est\r\ndomi cachinnorum.” Catull. “ad Sirm. Penin.”)\r\n\r\nAnd a happy reunion it was round that humble table: a feast Lucullus\r\nmight have envied in his Hall of Apollo, in the dried grapes, and\r\nthe dainty sardines, and the luxurious polenta, and the old lacrima a\r\npresent from the good Cardinal. The barbiton, placed on a chair--a tall,\r\nhigh-backed chair--beside the musician, seemed to take a part in the\r\nfestive meal. Its honest varnished face glowed in the light of the lamp;\r\nand there was an impish, sly demureness in its very silence, as its\r\nmaster, between every mouthful, turned to talk to it of something he had\r\nforgotten to relate before. The good wife looked on affectionately, and\r\ncould not eat for joy; but suddenly she rose, and placed on the\r\nartist’s temples a laurel wreath, which she had woven beforehand in fond\r\nanticipation; and Viola, on the other side her brother, the barbiton,\r\nrearranged the chaplet, and, smoothing back her father’s hair,\r\nwhispered, “Caro Padre, you will not let HIM scold me again!”\r\n\r\nThen poor Pisani, rather distracted between the two, and excited both by\r\nthe lacrima and his triumph, turned to the younger child with so naive\r\nand grotesque a pride, “I don’t know which to thank the most. You give\r\nme so much joy, child,--I am so proud of thee and myself. But he and I,\r\npoor fellow, have been so often unhappy together!”\r\n\r\nViola’s sleep was broken,--that was natural. The intoxication of vanity\r\nand triumph, the happiness in the happiness she had caused, all this was\r\nbetter than sleep. But still from all this, again and again her thoughts\r\nflew to those haunting eyes, to that smile with which forever the memory\r\nof the triumph, of the happiness, was to be united. Her feelings, like\r\nher own character, were strange and peculiar. They were not those of a\r\ngirl whose heart, for the first time reached through the eye, sighs\r\nits natural and native language of first love. It was not so much\r\nadmiration, though the face that reflected itself on every wave of her\r\nrestless fancies was of the rarest order of majesty and beauty; nor a\r\npleased and enamoured recollection that the sight of this stranger had\r\nbequeathed: it was a human sentiment of gratitude and delight, mixed\r\nwith something more mysterious, of fear and awe. Certainly she had seen\r\nbefore those features; but when and how? Only when her thoughts had\r\nsought to shape out her future, and when, in spite of all the attempts\r\nto vision forth a fate of flowers and sunshine, a dark and chill\r\nforeboding made her recoil back into her deepest self. It was a\r\nsomething found that had long been sought for by a thousand restless\r\nyearnings and vague desires, less of the heart than mind; not as when\r\nyouth discovers the one to be beloved, but rather as when the student,\r\nlong wandering after the clew to some truth in science, sees it glimmer\r\ndimly before him, to beckon, to recede, to allure, and to wane again.\r\nShe fell at last into unquiet slumber, vexed by deformed, fleeting,\r\nshapeless phantoms; and, waking, as the sun, through a veil of hazy\r\ncloud, glinted with a sickly ray across the casement, she heard her\r\nfather settled back betimes to his one pursuit, and calling forth from\r\nhis Familiar a low mournful strain, like a dirge over the dead.\r\n\r\n“And why,” she asked, when she descended to the room below,--“why, my\r\nfather, was your inspiration so sad, after the joy of last night?”\r\n\r\n“I know not, child. I meant to be merry, and compose an air in honour of\r\nthee; but he is an obstinate fellow, this,--and he would have it so.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IV.\r\n\r\n     E cosi i pigri e timidi desiri\r\n     Sprona.\r\n     “Gerusal. Lib.,” cant. iv. lxxxviii.\r\n\r\n     (And thus the slow and timid passions urged.)\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of Pisani, except when the duties of his profession\r\nmade special demand on his time, to devote a certain portion of the\r\nmid-day to sleep,--a habit not so much a luxury as a necessity to a man\r\nwho slept very little during the night. In fact, whether to compose\r\nor to practice, the hours of noon were precisely those in which Pisani\r\ncould not have been active if he would. His genius resembled those\r\nfountains full at dawn and evening, overflowing at night, and perfectly\r\ndry at the meridian. During this time, consecrated by her husband to\r\nrepose, the signora generally stole out to make the purchases necessary\r\nfor the little household, or to enjoy (as what woman does not?) a little\r\nrelaxation in gossip with some of her own sex. And the day following\r\nthis brilliant triumph, how many congratulations would she have to\r\nreceive!\r\n\r\nAt these times it was Viola’s habit to seat herself without the door\r\nof the house, under an awning which sheltered from the sun without\r\nobstructing the view; and there now, with the prompt-book on her knee,\r\non which her eye roves listlessly from time to time, you may behold\r\nher, the vine-leaves clustering from their arching trellis over the\r\ndoor behind, and the lazy white-sailed boats skimming along the sea that\r\nstretched before.\r\n\r\nAs she thus sat, rather in reverie than thought, a man coming from the\r\ndirection of Posilipo, with a slow step and downcast eyes, passed close\r\nby the house, and Viola, looking up abruptly, started in a kind of\r\nterror as she recognised the stranger. She uttered an involuntary\r\nexclamation, and the cavalier turning, saw, and paused.\r\n\r\nHe stood a moment or two between her and the sunlit ocean, contemplating\r\nin a silence too serious and gentle for the boldness of gallantry, the\r\nblushing face and the young slight form before him; at length he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Are you happy, my child,” he said, in almost a paternal tone, “at the\r\ncareer that lies before you? From sixteen to thirty, the music in the\r\nbreath of applause is sweeter than all the music your voice can utter!”\r\n\r\n“I know not,” replied Viola, falteringly, but encouraged by the liquid\r\nsoftness of the accents that addressed her,--“I know not whether I am\r\nhappy now, but I was last night. And I feel, too, Excellency, that I\r\nhave you to thank, though, perhaps, you scarce know why!”\r\n\r\n“You deceive yourself,” said the cavalier, with a smile. “I am aware\r\nthat I assisted to your merited success, and it is you who scarce know\r\nhow. The WHY I will tell you: because I saw in your heart a nobler\r\nambition than that of the woman’s vanity; it was the daughter that\r\ninterested me. Perhaps you would rather I should have admired the\r\nsinger?”\r\n\r\n“No; oh, no!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I believe you. And now, since we have thus met, I will pause to\r\ncounsel you. When next you go to the theatre, you will have at your feet\r\nall the young gallants of Naples. Poor infant! the flame that dazzles\r\nthe eye can scorch the wing. Remember that the only homage that does not\r\nsully must be that which these gallants will not give thee. And whatever\r\nthy dreams of the future,--and I see, while I speak to thee, how\r\nwandering they are, and wild,--may only those be fulfilled which centre\r\nround the hearth of home.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, as Viola’s breast heaved beneath its robe. And with a burst\r\nof natural and innocent emotions, scarcely comprehending, though an\r\nItalian, the grave nature of his advice, she exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“Ah, Excellency, you cannot know how dear to me that home is already.\r\nAnd my father,--there would be no home, signor, without him!”\r\n\r\nA deep and melancholy shade settled over the face of the cavalier. He\r\nlooked up at the quiet house buried amidst the vine-leaves, and turned\r\nagain to the vivid, animated face of the young actress.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said he. “A simple heart may be its own best guide, and\r\nso, go on, and prosper. Adieu, fair singer.”\r\n\r\n“Adieu, Excellency; but,” and something she could not resist--an\r\nanxious, sickening feeling of fear and hope,--impelled her to the\r\nquestion, “I shall see you again, shall I not, at San Carlo?”\r\n\r\n“Not, at least, for some time. I leave Naples to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” and Viola’s heart sank within her; the poetry of the stage was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n“And,” said the cavalier, turning back, and gently laying his hand on\r\nhers,--“and, perhaps, before we meet, you may have suffered: known the\r\nfirst sharp griefs of human life,--known how little what fame can gain,\r\nrepays what the heart can lose; but be brave and yield not,--not even to\r\nwhat may seem the piety of sorrow. Observe yon tree in your neighbour’s\r\ngarden. Look how it grows up, crooked and distorted. Some wind scattered\r\nthe germ from which it sprang, in the clefts of the rock; choked up and\r\nwalled round by crags and buildings, by Nature and man, its life has\r\nbeen one struggle for the light,--light which makes to that life the\r\nnecessity and the principle: you see how it has writhed and twisted;\r\nhow, meeting the barrier in one spot, it has laboured and worked, stem\r\nand branches, towards the clear skies at last. What has preserved it\r\nthrough each disfavour of birth and circumstances,--why are its leaves\r\nas green and fair as those of the vine behind you, which, with all\r\nits arms, can embrace the open sunshine? My child, because of the very\r\ninstinct that impelled the struggle,--because the labour for the light\r\nwon to the light at length. So with a gallant heart, through every\r\nadverse accident of sorrow and of fate to turn to the sun, to strive for\r\nthe heaven; this it is that gives knowledge to the strong and happiness\r\nto the weak. Ere we meet again, you will turn sad and heavy eyes to\r\nthose quiet boughs, and when you hear the birds sing from them, and see\r\nthe sunshine come aslant from crag and housetop to be the playfellow\r\nof their leaves, learn the lesson that Nature teaches you, and strive\r\nthrough darkness to the light!”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he moved on slowly, and left Viola wondering, silent,\r\nsaddened with his dim prophecy of coming evil, and yet, through sadness,\r\ncharmed. Involuntarily her eyes followed him,--involuntarily she\r\nstretched forth her arms, as if by a gesture to call him back; she would\r\nhave given worlds to have seen him turn,--to have heard once more his\r\nlow, calm, silvery voice; to have felt again the light touch of his hand\r\non hers. As moonlight that softens into beauty every angle on which it\r\nfalls, seemed his presence,--as moonlight vanishes, and things assume\r\ntheir common aspect of the rugged and the mean, he receded from her\r\neyes, and the outward scene was commonplace once more.\r\n\r\nThe stranger passed on, through that long and lovely road which reaches\r\nat last the palaces that face the public gardens, and conducts to the\r\nmore populous quarters of the city.\r\n\r\nA group of young, dissipated courtiers, loitering by the gateway of a\r\nhouse which was open for the favourite pastime of the day,--the resort\r\nof the wealthier and more high-born gamesters,--made way for him, as\r\nwith a courteous inclination he passed them by.\r\n\r\n“Per fede,” said one, “is not that the rich Zanoni, of whom the town\r\ntalks?”\r\n\r\n“Ay; they say his wealth is incalculable!”\r\n\r\n“THEY say,--who are THEY?--what is the authority? He has not been many\r\ndays at Naples, and I cannot yet find any one who knows aught of his\r\nbirthplace, his parentage, or, what is more important, his estates!”\r\n\r\n“That is true; but he arrived in a goodly vessel, which THEY SAY is his\r\nown. See,--no, you cannot see it here; but it rides yonder in the bay.\r\nThe bankers he deals with speak with awe of the sums placed in their\r\nhands.”\r\n\r\n“Whence came he?”\r\n\r\n“From some seaport in the East. My valet learned from some of the\r\nsailors on the Mole that he had resided many years in the interior of\r\nIndia.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I am told that in India men pick up gold like pebbles, and that\r\nthere are valleys where the birds build their nests with emeralds to\r\nattract the moths. Here comes our prince of gamesters, Cetoxa; be sure\r\nthat he already must have made acquaintance with so wealthy a cavalier;\r\nhe has that attraction to gold which the magnet has to steel. Well,\r\nCetoxa, what fresh news of the ducats of Signor Zanoni?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Cetoxa, carelessly, “my friend--”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! hear him; his friend--”\r\n\r\n“Yes; my friend Zanoni is going to Rome for a short time; when he\r\nreturns, he has promised me to fix a day to sup with me, and I will then\r\nintroduce him to you, and to the best society of Naples! Diavolo! but he\r\nis a most agreeable and witty gentleman!”\r\n\r\n“Pray tell us how you came so suddenly to be his friend.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Belgioso, nothing more natural. He desired a box at San Carlo;\r\nbut I need not tell you that the expectation of a new opera (ah, how\r\nsuperb it is,--that poor devil, Pisani; who would have thought it?) and\r\na new singer (what a face,--what a voice!--ah!) had engaged every corner\r\nof the house. I heard of Zanoni’s desire to honour the talent of Naples,\r\nand, with my usual courtesy to distinguished strangers, I sent to place\r\nmy box at his disposal. He accepts it,--I wait on him between the acts;\r\nhe is most charming; he invites me to supper. Cospetto, what a retinue!\r\nWe sit late,--I tell him all the news of Naples; we grow bosom friends;\r\nhe presses on me this diamond before we part,--is a trifle, he tells me:\r\nthe jewellers value it at 5000 pistoles!--the merriest evening I have\r\npassed these ten years.”\r\n\r\nThe cavaliers crowded round to admire the diamond.\r\n\r\n“Signor Count Cetoxa,” said one grave-looking sombre man, who had\r\ncrossed himself two or three times during the Neapolitan’s narrative,\r\n“are you not aware of the strange reports about this person; and are you\r\nnot afraid to receive from him a gift which may carry with it the most\r\nfatal consequences? Do you not know that he is said to be a sorcerer; to\r\npossess the mal-occhio; to--”\r\n\r\n“Prithee, spare us your antiquated superstitions,” interrupted Cetoxa,\r\ncontemptuously. “They are out of fashion; nothing now goes down but\r\nscepticism and philosophy. And what, after all, do these rumours, when\r\nsifted, amount to? They have no origin but this,--a silly old man of\r\neighty-six, quite in his dotage, solemnly avers that he saw this same\r\nZanoni seventy years ago (he himself, the narrator, then a mere boy) at\r\nMilan; when this very Zanoni, as you all see, is at least as young as\r\nyou or I, Belgioso.”\r\n\r\n“But that,” said the grave gentleman,--“THAT is the mystery. Old Avelli\r\ndeclares that Zanoni does not seem a day older than when they met at\r\nMilan. He says that even then at Milan--mark this--where, though\r\nunder another name, this Zanoni appeared in the same splendour, he was\r\nattended also by the same mystery. And that an old man THERE remembered\r\nto have seen him sixty years before, in Sweden.”\r\n\r\n“Tush,” returned Cetoxa, “the same thing has been said of the quack\r\nCagliostro,--mere fables. I will believe them when I see this diamond\r\nturn to a wisp of hay. For the rest,” he added gravely, “I consider this\r\nillustrious gentleman my friend; and a whisper against his honour and\r\nrepute will in future be equivalent to an affront to myself.”\r\n\r\nCetoxa was a redoubted swordsman, and excelled in a peculiarly awkward\r\nmanoeuvre, which he himself had added to the variations of the stoccata.\r\nThe grave gentleman, however anxious for the spiritual weal of the\r\ncount, had an equal regard for his own corporeal safety. He contented\r\nhimself with a look of compassion, and, turning through the gateway,\r\nascended the stairs to the gaming-tables.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” said Cetoxa, laughing, “our good Loredano is envious of my\r\ndiamond. Gentlemen, you sup with me to-night. I assure you I never met a\r\nmore delightful, sociable, entertaining person, than my dear friend the\r\nSignor Zanoni.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.V.\r\n\r\n     Quello Ippogifo, grande e strano augello\r\n     Lo porta via.\r\n     “Orlando Furioso,” c. vi. xviii.\r\n\r\n     (That hippogriff, great and marvellous bird, bears him away.)\r\n\r\nAnd now, accompanying this mysterious Zanoni, am I compelled to bid\r\na short farewell to Naples. Mount behind me,--mount on my hippogriff,\r\nreader; settle yourself at your ease. I bought the pillion the other\r\nday of a poet who loves his comfort; it has been newly stuffed for\r\nyour special accommodation. So, so, we ascend! Look as we ride\r\naloft,--look!--never fear, hippogriffs never stumble; and every\r\nhippogriff in Italy is warranted to carry elderly gentlemen,--look down\r\non the gliding landscapes! There, near the ruins of the Oscan’s old\r\nAtella, rises Aversa, once the stronghold of the Norman; there gleam the\r\ncolumns of Capua, above the Vulturnian Stream. Hail to ye, cornfields\r\nand vineyards famous for the old Falernian! Hail to ye, golden\r\norange-groves of Mola di Gaeta! Hail to ye, sweet shrubs and wild\r\nflowers, omnis copia narium, that clothe the mountain-skirts of the\r\nsilent Lautulae! Shall we rest at the Volscian Anxur,--the modern\r\nTerracina,--where the lofty rock stands like the giant that guards the\r\nlast borders of the southern land of love? Away, away! and hold your\r\nbreath as we flit above the Pontine Marshes. Dreary and desolate, their\r\nmiasma is to the gardens we have passed what the rank commonplace of\r\nlife is to the heart when it has left love behind.\r\n\r\nMournful Campagna, thou openest on us in majestic sadness. Rome,\r\nseven-hilled Rome! receive us as Memory receives the way-worn; receive\r\nus in silence, amidst ruins! Where is the traveller we pursue? Turn the\r\nhippogriff loose to graze: he loves the acanthus that wreathes round\r\nyon broken columns. Yes, that is the arch of Titus, the conqueror of\r\nJerusalem,--that the Colosseum! Through one passed the triumph of the\r\ndeified invader; in one fell the butchered gladiators. Monuments of\r\nmurder, how poor the thoughts, how mean the memories ye awaken, compared\r\nwith those that speak to the heart of man on the heights of Phyle, or\r\nby thy lone mound, grey Marathon! We stand amidst weeds and brambles\r\nand long waving herbage. Where we stand reigned Nero,--here were his\r\ntessellated floors; here,\r\n\r\n“Mighty in the heaven, a second heaven,”\r\n\r\nhung the vault of his ivory roofs; here, arch upon arch, pillar on\r\npillar, glittered to the world the golden palace of its master,--the\r\nGolden House of Nero. How the lizard watches us with his bright,\r\ntimorous eye! We disturb his reign. Gather that wild flower: the Golden\r\nHouse is vanished, but the wild flower may have kin to those which the\r\nstranger’s hand scattered over the tyrant’s grave; see, over this soil,\r\nthe grave of Rome, Nature strews the wild flowers still!\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this desolation is an old building of the middle ages.\r\nHere dwells a singular recluse. In the season of the malaria the native\r\npeasant flies the rank vegetation round; but he, a stranger and a\r\nforeigner, no associates, no companions, except books and instruments\r\nof science. He is often seen wandering over the grass-grown hills, or\r\nsauntering through the streets of the new city, not with the absent brow\r\nand incurious air of students, but with observant piercing eyes that\r\nseem to dive into the hearts of the passers-by. An old man, but not\r\ninfirm,--erect and stately, as if in his prime. None know whether he be\r\nrich or poor. He asks no charity, and he gives none,--he does no evil,\r\nand seems to confer no good. He is a man who appears to have no world\r\nbeyond himself; but appearances are deceitful, and Science, as well as\r\nBenevolence, lives in the Universe. This abode, for the first time since\r\nthus occupied, a visitor enters. It is Zanoni.\r\n\r\nYou observe those two men seated together, conversing earnestly. Years\r\nlong and many have flown away since they met last,--at least, bodily,\r\nand face to face. But if they are sages, thought can meet thought, and\r\nspirit spirit, though oceans divide the forms. Death itself divides not\r\nthe wise. Thou meetest Plato when thine eyes moisten over the Phaedo.\r\nMay Homer live with all men forever!\r\n\r\nThey converse; they confess to each other; they conjure up the past, and\r\nrepeople it; but note how differently do such remembrances affect the\r\ntwo. On Zanoni’s face, despite its habitual calm, the emotions change\r\nand go. HE has acted in the past he surveys; but not a trace of the\r\nhumanity that participates in joy and sorrow can be detected on the\r\npassionless visage of his companion; the past, to him, as is now\r\nthe present, has been but as Nature to the sage, the volume to the\r\nstudent,--a calm and spiritual life, a study, a contemplation.\r\n\r\nFrom the past they turn to the future. Ah! at the close of the last\r\ncentury, the future seemed a thing tangible,--it was woven up in all\r\nmen’s fears and hopes of the present.\r\n\r\nAt the verge of that hundred years, Man, the ripest born of Time,\r\n\r\n(“An des Jahrhunderts Neige, Der reifste Sohn der Zeit.” “Die\r\nKunstler.”)\r\n\r\nstood as at the deathbed of the Old World, and beheld the New Orb,\r\nblood-red amidst cloud and vapour,--uncertain if a comet or a sun.\r\nBehold the icy and profound disdain on the brow of the old man,--the\r\nlofty yet touching sadness that darkens the glorious countenance of\r\nZanoni. Is it that one views with contempt the struggle and its issue,\r\nand the other with awe or pity? Wisdom contemplating mankind leads but\r\nto the two results,--compassion or disdain. He who believes in other\r\nworlds can accustom himself to look on this as the naturalist on\r\nthe revolutions of an ant-hill, or of a leaf. What is the Earth to\r\nInfinity,--what its duration to the Eternal? Oh, how much greater is\r\nthe soul of one man than the vicissitudes of the whole globe! Child of\r\nheaven, and heir of immortality, how from some star hereafter wilt\r\nthou look back on the ant-hill and its commotions, from Clovis\r\nto Robespierre, from Noah to the Final Fire. The spirit that can\r\ncontemplate, that lives only in the intellect, can ascend to its star,\r\neven from the midst of the burial-ground called Earth, and while the\r\nsarcophagus called Life immures in its clay the everlasting!\r\n\r\nBut thou, Zanoni,--thou hast refused to live ONLY in the intellect; thou\r\nhast not mortified the heart; thy pulse still beats with the sweet music\r\nof mortal passion; thy kind is to thee still something warmer than an\r\nabstraction,--thou wouldst look upon this Revolution in its cradle,\r\nwhich the storms rock; thou wouldst see the world while its elements yet\r\nstruggle through the chaos!\r\n\r\nGo!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VI.\r\n\r\n     Precepteurs ignorans de ce faible univers.--Voltaire.\r\n     (Ignorant teachers of this weak world.)\r\n\r\n     Nous etions a table chez un de nos confreres a l’Academie,\r\n     Grand Seigneur et homme d’esprit.--La Harpe.\r\n     (We supped with one of our confreres of the Academy,--a great\r\n     nobleman and wit.)\r\n\r\nOne evening, at Paris, several months after the date of our last\r\nchapter, there was a reunion of some of the most eminent wits of the\r\ntime, at the house of a personage distinguished alike by noble birth and\r\nliberal accomplishments. Nearly all present were of the views that\r\nwere then the mode. For, as came afterwards a time when nothing was so\r\nunpopular as the people, so that was the time when nothing was so vulgar\r\nas aristocracy. The airiest fine gentleman and the haughtiest noble\r\nprated of equality, and lisped enlightenment.\r\n\r\nAmong the more remarkable guests were Condorcet, then in the prime of\r\nhis reputation, the correspondent of the king of Prussia, the intimate\r\nof Voltaire, the member of half the academies of Europe,--noble by\r\nbirth, polished in manners, republican in opinions. There, too, was the\r\nvenerable Malesherbes, “l’amour et les delices de la Nation.” (The idol\r\nand delight of the nation (so-called by his historian, Gaillard).) There\r\nJean Silvain Bailly, the accomplished scholar,--the aspiring politician.\r\nIt was one of those petits soupers for which the capital of all social\r\npleasures was so renowned. The conversation, as might be expected, was\r\nliterary and intellectual, enlivened by graceful pleasantry. Many of the\r\nladies of that ancient and proud noblesse--for the noblesse yet existed,\r\nthough its hours were already numbered--added to the charm of the\r\nsociety; and theirs were the boldest criticisms, and often the most\r\nliberal sentiments.\r\n\r\nVain labour for me--vain labour almost for the grave English\r\nlanguage--to do justice to the sparkling paradoxes that flew from lip\r\nto lip. The favourite theme was the superiority of the moderns to the\r\nancients. Condorcet on this head was eloquent, and to some, at least, of\r\nhis audience, most convincing. That Voltaire was greater than Homer few\r\nthere were disposed to deny. Keen was the ridicule lavished on the dull\r\npedantry which finds everything ancient necessarily sublime.\r\n\r\n“Yet,” said the graceful Marquis de --, as the champagne danced to his\r\nglass, “more ridiculous still is the superstition that finds everything\r\nincomprehensible holy! But intelligence circulates, Condorcet; like\r\nwater, it finds its level. My hairdresser said to me this morning,\r\n‘Though I am but a poor fellow, I believe as little as the finest\r\ngentleman!’” “Unquestionably, the great Revolution draws near to its\r\nfinal completion,--a pas de geant, as Montesquieu said of his own\r\nimmortal work.”\r\n\r\nThen there rushed from all--wit and noble, courtier and republican--a\r\nconfused chorus, harmonious only in its anticipation of the brilliant\r\nthings to which “the great Revolution” was to give birth. Here Condrocet\r\nis more eloquent than before.\r\n\r\n“Il faut absolument que la Superstition et le Fanatisme fassent place\r\na la Philosophie. (It must necessarily happen that superstition and\r\nfanaticism give place to philosophy.) Kings persecute persons, priests\r\nopinion. Without kings, men must be safe; and without priests, minds\r\nmust be free.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” murmured the marquis, “and as ce cher Diderot has so well sung,--\r\n\r\n‘Et des boyaux du dernier pretre Serrez le cou du dernier roi.’”\r\n\r\n     (And throttle the neck of the last king with the string from\r\n     the bowels of the last priest.)\r\n\r\n“And then,” resumed Condorcet,--“then commences the Age of\r\nReason!--equality in instruction, equality in institutions, equality\r\nin wealth! The great impediments to knowledge are, first, the want of\r\na common language; and next, the short duration of existence. But as to\r\nthe first, when all men are brothers, why not a universal language?\r\nAs to the second, the organic perfectibility of the vegetable world is\r\nundisputed, is Nature less powerful in the nobler existence of thinking\r\nman? The very destruction of the two most active causes of physical\r\ndeterioration--here, luxurious wealth; there, abject penury,--must\r\nnecessarily prolong the general term of life. (See Condorcet’s\r\nposthumous work on the Progress of the Human Mind.--Ed.) The art of\r\nmedicine will then be honoured in the place of war, which is the art of\r\nmurder: the noblest study of the acutest minds will be devoted to the\r\ndiscovery and arrest of the causes of disease. Life, I grant, cannot be\r\nmade eternal; but it may be prolonged almost indefinitely. And as\r\nthe meaner animal bequeaths its vigour to its offspring, so man shall\r\ntransmit his improved organisation, mental and physical, to his sons.\r\nOh, yes, to such a consummation does our age approach!”\r\n\r\nThe venerable Malesherbes sighed. Perhaps he feared the consummation\r\nmight not come in time for him. The handsome Marquis de -- and the\r\nladies, yet handsomer than he, looked conviction and delight.\r\n\r\nBut two men there were, seated next to each other, who joined not in\r\nthe general talk: the one a stranger newly arrived in Paris, where\r\nhis wealth, his person, and his accomplishments, had already made\r\nhim remarked and courted; the other, an old man, somewhere about\r\nseventy,--the witty and virtuous, brave, and still light-hearted\r\nCazotte, the author of “Le Diable Amoureux.”\r\n\r\nThese two conversed familiarly, and apart from the rest, and only by an\r\noccasional smile testified their attention to the general conversation.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the stranger,--“yes, we have met before.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I could not forget your countenance; yet I task in vain my\r\nrecollections of the past.”\r\n\r\n“I will assist you. Recall the time when, led by curiosity, or\r\nperhaps the nobler desire of knowledge, you sought initiation into the\r\nmysterious order of Martines de Pasqualis.”\r\n\r\n(It is so recorded of Cazotte. Of Martines de Pasqualis little is known;\r\neven the country to which he belonged is matter of conjecture. Equally\r\nso the rites, ceremonies, and nature of the cabalistic order he\r\nestablished. St. Martin was a disciple of the school, and that, at\r\nleast, is in its favour; for in spite of his mysticism, no man more\r\nbeneficent, generous, pure, and virtuous than St. Martin adorned the\r\nlast century. Above all, no man more distinguished himself from the herd\r\nof sceptical philosophers by the gallantry and fervour with which he\r\ncombated materialism, and vindicated the necessity of faith amidst a\r\nchaos of unbelief. It may also be observed, that Cazotte, whatever\r\nelse he learned of the brotherhood of Martines, learned nothing that\r\ndiminished the excellence of his life and the sincerity of his religion.\r\nAt once gentle and brave, he never ceased to oppose the excesses of\r\nthe Revolution. To the last, unlike the Liberals of his time, he was a\r\ndevout and sincere Christian. Before his execution, he demanded a pen\r\nand paper to write these words: “Ma femme, mes enfans, ne me pleurez\r\npas; ne m’oubliez pas, mais souvenez-vous surtout de ne jamais offenser\r\nDieu.” (“My wife, my children, weep not for me; forget me not, but\r\nremember above everything never to offend God.)--Ed.)\r\n\r\n“Ah, is it possible! You are one of that theurgic brotherhood?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I attended their ceremonies but to see how vainly they sought to\r\nrevive the ancient marvels of the cabala.”\r\n\r\n“Such studies please you? I have shaken off the influence they once had\r\non my own imagination.”\r\n\r\n“You have not shaken it off,” returned the stranger, bravely; “it is on\r\nyou still,--on you at this hour; it beats in your heart; it kindles in\r\nyour reason; it will speak in your tongue!”\r\n\r\nAnd then, with a yet lower voice, the stranger continued to address\r\nhim, to remind him of certain ceremonies and doctrines,--to explain and\r\nenforce them by references to the actual experience and history of his\r\nlistener, which Cazotte thrilled to find so familiar to a stranger.\r\n\r\nGradually the old man’s pleasing and benevolent countenance grew\r\novercast, and he turned, from time to time, searching, curious, uneasy\r\nglances towards his companion.\r\n\r\nThe charming Duchesse de G-- archly pointed out to the lively guests the\r\nabstracted air and clouded brow of the poet; and Condorcet, who liked no\r\none else to be remarked, when he himself was present, said to Cazotte,\r\n“Well, and what do YOU predict of the Revolution,--how, at least, will\r\nit affect us?”\r\n\r\nAt that question Cazotte started; his cheeks grew pale, large drops\r\nstood on his forehead; his lips writhed; his gay companions gazed on him\r\nin surprise.\r\n\r\n“Speak!” whispered the stranger, laying his hand gently upon the arm of\r\nthe old wit.\r\n\r\nAt that word Cazotte’s face grew locked and rigid, his eyes dwelt\r\nvacantly on space, and in a low, hollow voice, he thus answered\r\n\r\n(The following prophecy (not unfamiliar, perhaps, to some of my\r\nreaders), with some slight variations, and at greater length, in the\r\ntext of the authority I am about to cite, is to be found in La\r\nHarpe’s posthumous works. The MS. is said to exist still in La Harpe’s\r\nhandwriting, and the story is given on M. Petitot’s authority, volume\r\ni. page 62. It is not for me to enquire if there be doubts of its\r\nfoundation on fact.--Ed.),--\r\n\r\n“You ask how it will affect yourselves,--you, its most learned, and its\r\nleast selfish agents. I will answer: you, Marquis de Condorcet, will\r\ndie in prison, but not by the hand of the executioner. In the peaceful\r\nhappiness of that day, the philosopher will carry about with him not the\r\nelixir but the poison.”\r\n\r\n“My poor Cazotte,” said Condorcet, with his gentle smile, “what have\r\nprisons, executioners, and poison to do with an age of liberty and\r\nbrotherhood?”\r\n\r\n“It is in the names of Liberty and Brotherhood that the prisons will\r\nreek, and the headsman be glutted.”\r\n\r\n“You are thinking of priestcraft, not philosophy, Cazotte,” said\r\nChampfort.\r\n\r\n(Champfort, one of those men of letters who, though misled by the first\r\nfair show of the Revolution, refused to follow the baser men of action\r\ninto its horrible excesses, lived to express the murderous philanthropy\r\nof its agents by the best bon mot of the time. Seeing written on the\r\nwalls, “Fraternite ou la Mort,” he observed that the sentiment should be\r\ntranslated thus, “Sois mon frere, ou je te tue.” (“Be my brother, or I\r\nkill thee.”)) “And what of me?”\r\n\r\n“You will open your own veins to escape the fraternity of Cain. Be\r\ncomforted; the last drops will not follow the razor. For you, venerable\r\nMalesherbes; for you, Aimar Nicolai; for you, learned Bailly,--I see\r\nthem dress the scaffold! And all the while, O great philosophers, your\r\nmurderers will have no word but philosophy on their lips!”\r\n\r\nThe hush was complete and universal when the pupil of Voltaire--the\r\nprince of the academic sceptics, hot La Harpe--cried with a sarcastic\r\nlaugh, “Do not flatter me, O prophet, by exemption from the fate of\r\nmy companions. Shall _I_ have no part to play in this drama of your\r\nfantasies.”\r\n\r\nAt this question, Cazotte’s countenance lost its unnatural expression of\r\nawe and sternness; the sardonic humour most common to it came back and\r\nplayed in his brightening eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, La Harpe, the most wonderful part of all! YOU will become--a\r\nChristian!”\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the audience that a moment before seemed grave\r\nand thoughtful, and they burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, while\r\nCazotte, as if exhausted by his predictions, sank back in his chair, and\r\nbreathed hard and heavily.\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Madame de G--, “you who have predicted such grave things\r\nconcerning us, must prophesy something also about yourself.”\r\n\r\nA convulsive tremor shook the involuntary prophet,--it passed, and\r\nleft his countenance elevated by an expression of resignation and calm.\r\n“Madame,” said he, after a long pause, “during the siege of Jerusalem,\r\nwe are told by its historian that a man, for seven successive days,\r\nwent round the ramparts, exclaiming, ‘Woe to thee, Jerusalem,--woe to\r\nmyself!’”\r\n\r\n“Well, Cazotte, well?”\r\n\r\n“And on the seventh day, while he thus spoke, a stone from the machines\r\nof the Romans dashed him into atoms!”\r\n\r\nWith these words, Cazotte rose; and the guests, awed in spite of\r\nthemselves, shortly afterwards broke up and retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VII.\r\n\r\n     Qui donc t’a donne la mission s’annoncer au peuple que la\r\n     divinite n’existe pas?  Quel avantage trouves-tu a persuader a\r\n     l’homme qu’une force aveugle preside a ses destinees et frappe au\r\n     hasard le crime et la vertu?--Robespierre, “Discours,” Mai 7,\r\n     1794.\r\n\r\n     (Who then invested you with the mission to announce to the people\r\n     that there is no God?  What advantage find you in persuading man\r\n     that nothing but blind force presides over his destinies, and\r\n     strikes haphazard both crime and virtue?)\r\n\r\nIt was some time before midnight when the stranger returned home. His\r\napartments were situated in one of those vast abodes which may be called\r\nan epitome of Paris itself,--the cellars rented by mechanics, scarcely\r\nremoved a step from paupers, often by outcasts and fugitives from the\r\nlaw, often by some daring writer, who, after scattering amongst the\r\npeople doctrines the most subversive of order, or the most libellous on\r\nthe characters of priest, minister, and king, retired amongst the rats,\r\nto escape the persecution that attends the virtuous; the ground-floor\r\noccupied by shops; the entresol by artists; the principal stories by\r\nnobles; and the garrets by journeymen or grisettes.\r\n\r\nAs the stranger passed up the stairs, a young man of a form and\r\ncountenance singularly unprepossessing emerged from a door in the\r\nentresol, and brushed beside him. His glance was furtive, sinister,\r\nsavage, and yet timorous; the man’s face was of an ashen paleness, and\r\nthe features worked convulsively. The stranger paused, and observed\r\nhim with thoughtful looks, as he hurried down the stairs. While he\r\nthus stood, he heard a groan from the room which the young man had just\r\nquitted; the latter had pulled to the door with hasty vehemence, but\r\nsome fragment, probably of fuel, had prevented its closing, and it now\r\nstood slightly ajar; the stranger pushed it open and entered. He passed\r\na small anteroom, meanly furnished, and stood in a bedchamber of meagre\r\nand sordid discomfort. Stretched on the bed, and writhing in pain, lay\r\nan old man; a single candle lit the room, and threw its feeble ray over\r\nthe furrowed and death-like face of the sick person. No attendant\r\nwas by; he seemed left alone, to breathe his last. “Water,” he moaned\r\nfeebly,--“water:--I parch,--I burn!” The intruder approached the bed,\r\nbent over him, and took his hand. “Oh, bless thee, Jean, bless thee!”\r\n said the sufferer; “hast thou brought back the physician already? Sir,\r\nI am poor, but I can pay you well. I would not die yet, for that young\r\nman’s sake.” And he sat upright in his bed, and fixed his dim eyes\r\nanxiously on his visitor.\r\n\r\n“What are your symptoms, your disease?”\r\n\r\n“Fire, fire, fire in the heart, the entrails: I burn!”\r\n\r\n“How long is it since you have taken food?”\r\n\r\n“Food! only this broth. There is the basin, all I have taken these six\r\nhours. I had scarce drunk it ere these pains began.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked at the basin; some portion of the contents was yet\r\nleft there.\r\n\r\n“Who administered this to you?”\r\n\r\n“Who? Jean! Who else should? I have no servant,--none! I am poor, very\r\npoor, sir. But no! you physicians do not care for the poor. I AM RICH!\r\ncan you cure me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if Heaven permit. Wait but a few moments.”\r\n\r\nThe old man was fast sinking under the rapid effects of poison. The\r\nstranger repaired to his own apartments, and returned in a few moments\r\nwith some preparation that had the instant result of an antidote. The\r\npain ceased, the blue and livid colour receded from the lips; the old\r\nman fell into a profound sleep. The stranger drew the curtains round the\r\nbed, took up the light, and inspected the apartment. The walls of both\r\nrooms were hung with drawings of masterly excellence. A portfolio\r\nwas filled with sketches of equal skill,--but these last were mostly\r\nsubjects that appalled the eye and revolted the taste: they displayed\r\nthe human figure in every variety of suffering,--the rack, the wheel,\r\nthe gibbet; all that cruelty has invented to sharpen the pangs of death\r\nseemed yet more dreadful from the passionate gusto and earnest force of\r\nthe designer. And some of the countenances of those thus delineated were\r\nsufficiently removed from the ideal to show that they were portraits; in\r\na large, bold, irregular hand was written beneath these drawings, “The\r\nFuture of the Aristocrats.” In a corner of the room, and close by an old\r\nbureau, was a small bundle, over which, as if to hide it, a cloak was\r\nthrown carelessly. Several shelves were filled with books; these\r\nwere almost entirely the works of the philosophers of the time,--the\r\nphilosophers of the material school, especially the Encyclopedistes,\r\nwhom Robespierre afterwards so singularly attacked when the coward\r\ndeemed it unsafe to leave his reign without a God.\r\n\r\n(“Cette secte (les Encyclopedistes) propagea avec beaucoup de zele\r\nl’opinion du materialisme, qui prevalut parmi les grands et parmi\r\nles beaux esprits; on lui doit en partie cette espece de philosophie\r\npratique qui, reduisant l’Egoisme en systeme regarde la societe humaine\r\ncomme une guerre de ruse, le succes comme la regle du juste et de\r\nl’injuste, la probite comme une affaire de gout, ou de bienseance,\r\nle monde comme le patrimoine des fripons adroits.”--“Discours de\r\nRobespierre,” Mai 7, 1794. (This sect (the Encyclopaedists) propagate\r\nwith much zeal the doctrine of materialism, which prevails among\r\nthe great and the wits; we owe to it partly that kind of practical\r\nphilosophy which, reducing Egotism to a system, looks upon society as\r\na war of cunning; success the rule of right and wrong, honesty as an\r\naffair of taste or decency: and the world as the patrimony of clever\r\nscoundrels.))\r\n\r\nA volume lay on a table,--it was one of Voltaire, and the page was\r\nopened at his argumentative assertion of the existence of the Supreme\r\nBeing. (“Histoire de Jenni.”) The margin was covered with pencilled\r\nnotes, in the stiff but tremulous hand of old age; all in attempt to\r\nrefute or to ridicule the logic of the sage of Ferney: Voltaire did not\r\ngo far enough for the annotator! The clock struck two, when the sound\r\nof steps was heard without. The stranger silently seated himself on the\r\nfarther side of the bed, and its drapery screened him, as he sat, from\r\nthe eyes of a man who now entered on tiptoe; it was the same person\r\nwho had passed him on the stairs. The new-comer took up the candle and\r\napproached the bed. The old man’s face was turned to the pillow; but he\r\nlay so still, and his breathing was so inaudible, that his sleep might\r\nwell, by that hasty, shrinking, guilty glance, be mistaken for the\r\nrepose of death. The new-comer drew back, and a grim smile passed over\r\nhis face: he replaced the candle on the table, opened the bureau with\r\na key which he took from his pocket, and loaded himself with several\r\nrouleaus of gold that he found in the drawers. At this time the old man\r\nbegan to wake. He stirred, he looked up; he turned his eyes towards the\r\nlight now waning in its socket; he saw the robber at his work; he sat\r\nerect for an instant, as if transfixed, more even by astonishment than\r\nterror. At last he sprang from his bed.\r\n\r\n“Just Heaven! do I dream! Thou--thou--thou, for whom I toiled and\r\nstarved!--THOU!”\r\n\r\nThe robber started; the gold fell from his hand, and rolled on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“What!” he said, “art thou not dead yet? Has the poison failed?”\r\n\r\n“Poison, boy! Ah!” shrieked the old man, and covered his face with his\r\nhands; then, with sudden energy, he exclaimed, “Jean! Jean! recall that\r\nword. Rob, plunder me if thou wilt, but do not say thou couldst murder\r\none who only lived for thee! There, there, take the gold; I hoarded it\r\nbut for thee. Go! go!” and the old man, who in his passion had quitted\r\nhis bed, fell at the feet of the foiled assassin, and writhed on the\r\nground,--the mental agony more intolerable than that of the body,\r\nwhich he had so lately undergone. The robber looked at him with a\r\nhard disdain. “What have I ever done to thee, wretch?” cried the old\r\nman,--“what but loved and cherished thee? Thou wert an orphan,--an\r\noutcast. I nurtured, nursed, adopted thee as my son. If men call me a\r\nmiser, it was but that none might despise thee, my heir, because Nature\r\nhas stunted and deformed thee, when I was no more. Thou wouldst have\r\nhad all when I was dead. Couldst thou not spare me a few months or\r\ndays,--nothing to thy youth, all that is left to my age? What have I\r\ndone to thee?”\r\n\r\n“Thou hast continued to live, and thou wouldst make no will.”\r\n\r\n“Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!”\r\n\r\n“TON DIEU! Thy God! Fool! Hast thou not told me, from my childhood, that\r\nthere is NO God? Hast thou not fed me on philosophy? Hast thou not said,\r\n‘Be virtuous, be good, be just, for the sake of mankind: but there is no\r\nlife after this life’? Mankind! why should I love mankind? Hideous and\r\nmisshapen, mankind jeer at me as I pass the streets. What hast thou done\r\nto me? Thou hast taken away from me, who am the scoff of this world, the\r\nhopes of another! Is there no other life? Well, then, I want thy gold,\r\nthat at least I may hasten to make the best of this!”\r\n\r\n“Monster! Curses light on thy ingratitude, thy--”\r\n\r\n“And who hears thy curses? Thou knowest there is no God! Mark me; I have\r\nprepared all to fly. See,--I have my passport; my horses wait without;\r\nrelays are ordered. I have thy gold.” (And the wretch, as he spoke,\r\ncontinued coldly to load his person with the rouleaus). “And now, if I\r\nspare thy life, how shall I be sure that thou wilt not inform against\r\nmine?” He advanced with a gloomy scowl and a menacing gesture as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s anger changed to fear. He cowered before the savage. “Let\r\nme live! let me live!--that--that--”\r\n\r\n“That--what?”\r\n\r\n“I may pardon thee! Yes, thou hast nothing to fear from me. I swear it!”\r\n\r\n“Swear! But by whom and what, old man? I cannot believe thee, if thou\r\nbelievest not in any God! Ha, ha! behold the result of thy lessons.”\r\n\r\nAnother moment and those murderous fingers would have strangled their\r\nprey. But between the assassin and his victim rose a form that seemed\r\nalmost to both a visitor from the world that both denied,--stately with\r\nmajestic strength, glorious with awful beauty.\r\n\r\nThe ruffian recoiled, looked, trembled, and then turned and fled from\r\nthe chamber. The old man fell again to the ground insensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VIII.\r\n\r\n     To know how a bad man will act when in power, reverse all the\r\n     doctrines he preaches when obscure.--S. Montague.\r\n\r\n     Antipathies also form a part of magic (falsely) so-called.  Man\r\n     naturally has the same instinct as the animals, which warns them\r\n     involuntarily against the creatures that are hostile or fatal to\r\n     their existence.  But HE so often neglects it, that it becomes\r\n     dormant.  Not so the true cultivator of the Great Science, etc.\r\n\r\n     --Trismegistus the Fourth (a Rosicrucian).\r\n\r\nWhen he again saw the old man the next day, the stranger found him calm,\r\nand surprisingly recovered from the scene and sufferings of the night.\r\nHe expressed his gratitude to his preserver with tearful fervour,\r\nand stated that he had already sent for a relation who would make\r\narrangements for his future safety and mode of life. “For I have money\r\nyet left,” said the old man; “and henceforth have no motive to be a\r\nmiser.” He proceeded then briefly to relate the origin and circumstances\r\nof his connection with his intended murderer.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in earlier life he had quarrelled with his\r\nrelations,--from a difference in opinions of belief. Rejecting all\r\nreligion as a fable, he yet cultivated feelings that inclined him--for\r\nthough his intellect was weak, his dispositions were good--to that\r\nfalse and exaggerated sensibility which its dupes so often mistake\r\nfor benevolence. He had no children; he resolved to adopt an enfant\r\ndu peuple. He resolved to educate this boy according to “reason.” He\r\nselected an orphan of the lowest extraction, whose defects of person and\r\nconstitution only yet the more moved his pity, and finally engrossed his\r\naffection. In this outcast he not only loved a son, he loved a theory!\r\nHe brought him up most philosophically. Helvetius had proved to him\r\nthat education can do all; and before he was eight years old, the little\r\nJean’s favourite expressions were, “La lumiere et la vertu.” (Light and\r\nvirtue.) The boy showed talents, especially in art.\r\n\r\nThe protector sought for a master who was as free from “superstition” as\r\nhimself, and selected the painter David. That person, as hideous as\r\nhis pupil, and whose dispositions were as vicious as his professional\r\nabilities were undeniable, was certainly as free from “superstition” as\r\nthe protector could desire. It was reserved for Robespierre hereafter\r\nto make the sanguinary painter believe in the Etre Supreme. The boy\r\nwas early sensible of his ugliness, which was almost preternatural. His\r\nbenefactor found it in vain to reconcile him to the malice of Nature by\r\nhis philosophical aphorisms; but when he pointed out to him that in\r\nthis world money, like charity, covers a multitude of defects, the boy\r\nlistened eagerly and was consoled. To save money for his protege,--for\r\nthe only thing in the world he loved,--this became the patron’s passion.\r\nVerily, he had met with his reward.\r\n\r\n“But I am thankful he has escaped,” said the old man, wiping his eyes.\r\n“Had he left me a beggar, I could never have accused him.”\r\n\r\n“No, for you are the author of his crimes.”\r\n\r\n“How! I, who never ceased to inculcate the beauty of virtue? Explain\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! if thy pupil did not make this clear to thee last night from his\r\nown lips, an angel might come from heaven to preach to thee in vain.”\r\n\r\nThe old man moved uneasily, and was about to reply, when the relative he\r\nhad sent for--and who, a native of Nancy, happened to be at Paris at the\r\ntime--entered the room. He was a man somewhat past thirty, and of a dry,\r\nsaturnine, meagre countenance, restless eyes, and compressed lips. He\r\nlistened, with many ejaculations of horror, to his relation’s recital,\r\nand sought earnestly, but in vain, to induce him to give information\r\nagainst his protege.\r\n\r\n“Tush, tush, Rene Dumas!” said the old man, “you are a lawyer. You are\r\nbred to regard human life with contempt. Let any man break a law, and\r\nyou shout, ‘Execute him!’”\r\n\r\n“I!” cried Dumas, lifting up his hands and eyes: “venerable sage, how\r\nyou misjudge me! I lament more than any one the severity of our code. I\r\nthink the state never should take away life,--no, not even the life of\r\na murderer. I agree with that young statesman,--Maximilien\r\nRobespierre,--that the executioner is the invention of the tyrant. My\r\nvery attachment to our advancing revolution is, that it must sweep away\r\nthis legal butchery.”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer paused, out of breath. The stranger regarded him fixedly and\r\nturned pale.\r\n\r\n“You change countenance, sir,” said Dumas; “you do not agree with me.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, I was at that moment repressing a vague fear which seemed\r\nprophetic.”\r\n\r\n“And that--”\r\n\r\n“Was that we should meet again, when your opinions on Death and the\r\nphilosophy of Revolutions might be different.”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“You enchant me, Cousin Rene,” said the old man, who had listened to his\r\nrelation with delight. “Ah, I see you have proper sentiments of justice\r\nand philanthropy. Why did I not seek to know you before? You admire the\r\nRevolution;--you, equally with me, detest the barbarity of kings and the\r\nfraud of priests?”\r\n\r\n“Detest! How could I love mankind if I did not?”\r\n\r\n“And,” said the old man, hesitatingly, “you do not think, with this\r\nnoble gentleman, that I erred in the precepts I instilled into that\r\nwretched man?”\r\n\r\n“Erred! Was Socrates to blame if Alcibiades was an adulterer and a\r\ntraitor?”\r\n\r\n“You hear him, you hear him! But Socrates had also a Plato; henceforth\r\nyou shall be a Plato to me. You hear him?” exclaimed the old man,\r\nturning to the stranger.\r\n\r\nBut the latter was at the threshold. Who shall argue with the most\r\nstubborn of all bigotries,--the fanaticism of unbelief?\r\n\r\n“Are you going?” exclaimed Dumas, “and before I have thanked you,\r\nblessed you, for the life of this dear and venerable man? Oh, if ever I\r\ncan repay you,--if ever you want the heart’s blood of Rene Dumas!” Thus\r\nvolubly delivering himself, he followed the stranger to the threshold of\r\nthe second chamber, and there, gently detaining him, and after looking\r\nover his shoulder, to be sure that he was not heard by the owner,\r\nhe whispered, “I ought to return to Nancy. One would not lose one’s\r\ntime,--you don’t think, sir, that that scoundrel took away ALL the old\r\nfool’s money?”\r\n\r\n“Was it thus Plato spoke of Socrates, Monsieur Dumas?”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!--you are caustic. Well, you have a right. Sir, we shall meet\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“AGAIN!” muttered the stranger, and his brow darkened. He hastened to\r\nhis chamber; he passed the day and the night alone, and in studies, no\r\nmatter of what nature,--they served to increase his gloom.\r\n\r\nWhat could ever connect his fate with Rene Dumas, or the fugitive\r\nassassin? Why did the buoyant air of Paris seem to him heavy with\r\nthe steams of blood; why did an instinct urge him to fly from those\r\nsparkling circles, from that focus of the world’s awakened hopes,\r\nwarning him from return?--he, whose lofty existence defied--but away\r\nthese dreams and omens! He leaves France behind. Back, O Italy, to thy\r\nmajestic wrecks! On the Alps his soul breathes the free air once more.\r\nFree air! Alas! let the world-healers exhaust their chemistry; man never\r\nshall be as free in the marketplace as on the mountain. But we, reader,\r\nwe too escape from these scenes of false wisdom clothing godless crime.\r\nAway, once more\r\n\r\n“In den heitern Regionen Wo die reinen Formen wohnen.”\r\n\r\nAway, to the loftier realm where the pure dwellers are. Unpolluted by\r\nthe Actual, the Ideal lives only with Art and Beauty. Sweet Viola, by\r\nthe shores of the blue Parthenope, by Virgil’s tomb, and the Cimmerian\r\ncavern, we return to thee once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IX.\r\n\r\n     Che non vuol che ‘l destrier piu vada in alto,\r\n     Poi lo lega nel margine marino\r\n     A un verde mirto in mezzo un lauro E UN PINO.\r\n     “Orlando Furioso,” c. vi. xxiii.\r\n\r\n     (As he did not wish that his charger (the hippogriff) should take\r\n     any further excursions into the higher regions for the present,\r\n     he bound him at the sea-shore to a green myrtle between a laurel\r\n     and a pine.)\r\n\r\nO Musician! art thou happy now? Thou art reinstalled at thy stately\r\ndesk,--thy faithful barbiton has its share in the triumph. It is thy\r\nmasterpiece which fills thy ear; it is thy daughter who fills the\r\nscene,--the music, the actress, so united, that applause to one is\r\napplause to both. They make way for thee, at the orchestra,--they no\r\nlonger jeer and wink, when, with a fierce fondness, thou dost caress\r\nthy Familiar, that plains, and wails, and chides, and growls, under thy\r\nremorseless hand. They understand now how irregular is ever the symmetry\r\nof real genius. The inequalities in its surface make the moon luminous\r\nto man. Giovanni Paisiello, Maestro di Capella, if thy gentle soul could\r\nknow envy, thou must sicken to see thy Elfrida and thy Pirro laid aside,\r\nand all Naples turned fanatic to the Siren, at whose measures shook\r\nquerulously thy gentle head! But thou, Paisiello, calm in the long\r\nprosperity of fame, knowest that the New will have its day, and\r\ncomfortest thyself that the Elfrida and the Pirro will live forever.\r\nPerhaps a mistake, but it is by such mistakes that true genius conquers\r\nenvy. “To be immortal,” says Schiller, “live in the whole.” To be\r\nsuperior to the hour, live in thy self-esteem. The audience now would\r\ngive their ears for those variations and flights they were once wont to\r\nhiss. No!--Pisani has been two-thirds of a life at silent work on his\r\nmasterpiece: there is nothing he can add to THAT, however he might have\r\nsought to improve on the masterpieces of others. Is not this common?\r\nThe least little critic, in reviewing some work of art, will say, “pity\r\nthis, and pity that;” “this should have been altered,--that omitted.”\r\n Yea, with his wiry fiddlestring will he creak out his accursed\r\nvariations. But let him sit down and compose himself. He sees no\r\nimprovement in variations THEN! Every man can control his fiddle when it\r\nis his own work with which its vagaries would play the devil.\r\n\r\nAnd Viola is the idol, the theme of Naples. She is the spoiled sultana\r\nof the boards. To spoil her acting may be easy enough,--shall they\r\nspoil her nature? No, I think not. There, at home, she is still good\r\nand simple; and there, under the awning by the doorway,--there she still\r\nsits, divinely musing. How often, crook-trunked tree, she looks to thy\r\ngreen boughs; how often, like thee, in her dreams, and fancies, does she\r\nstruggle for the light,--not the light of the stage-lamps. Pooh, child!\r\nbe contented with the lamps, even with the rush-lights. A farthing\r\ncandle is more convenient for household purposes than the stars.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed, and the stranger did not reappear; months had passed, and\r\nhis prophecy of sorrow was not yet fulfilled. One evening Pisani was\r\ntaken ill. His success had brought on the long-neglected composer\r\npressing applications for concerti and sonata, adapted to his more\r\npeculiar science on the violin. He had been employed for some weeks, day\r\nand night, on a piece in which he hoped to excel himself. He took, as\r\nusual, one of those seemingly impracticable subjects which it was his\r\npride to subject to the expressive powers of his art,--the terrible\r\nlegend connected with the transformation of Philomel. The pantomime of\r\nsound opened with the gay merriment of a feast. The monarch of Thrace\r\nis at his banquet; a sudden discord brays through the joyous notes,--the\r\nstring seems to screech with horror. The king learns the murder of his\r\nson by the hands of the avenging sisters. Swift rage the chords, through\r\nthe passions of fear, of horror, of fury, and dismay. The father pursues\r\nthe sisters. Hark! what changes the dread--the discord--into that long,\r\nsilvery, mournful music? The transformation is completed; and Philomel,\r\nnow the nightingale, pours from the myrtle-bough the full, liquid,\r\nsubduing notes that are to tell evermore to the world the history of\r\nher woes and wrongs. Now, it was in the midst of this complicated and\r\ndifficult attempt that the health of the over-tasked musician, excited\r\nalike by past triumph and new ambition, suddenly gave way. He was taken\r\nill at night. The next morning the doctor pronounced that his disease\r\nwas a malignant and infectious fever. His wife and Viola shared in their\r\ntender watch; but soon that task was left to the last alone. The Signora\r\nPisani caught the infection, and in a few hours was even in a state more\r\nalarming than that of her husband. The Neapolitans, in common with the\r\ninhabitants of all warm climates, are apt to become selfish and brutal\r\nin their dread of infectious disorders. Gionetta herself pretended to be\r\nill, to avoid the sick-chamber. The whole labour of love and sorrow\r\nfell on Viola. It was a terrible trial,--I am willing to hurry over the\r\ndetails. The wife died first!\r\n\r\nOne day, a little before sunset, Pisani woke partially recovered from\r\nthe delirium which had preyed upon him, with few intervals, since the\r\nsecond day of the disease; and casting about him his dizzy and feeble\r\neyes, he recognised Viola, and smiled. He faltered her name as he rose\r\nand stretched his arms. She fell upon his breast, and strove to suppress\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\n“Thy mother?” he said. “Does she sleep?”\r\n\r\n“She sleeps,--ah, yes!” and the tears gushed forth.\r\n\r\n“I thought--eh! I know not WHAT I have thought. But do not weep: I shall\r\nbe well now,--quite well. She will come to me when she wakes,--will\r\nshe?”\r\n\r\nViola could not speak; but she busied herself in pouring forth an\r\nanodyne, which she had been directed to give the sufferer as soon as the\r\ndelirium should cease. The doctor had told her, too, to send for him the\r\ninstant so important a change should occur.\r\n\r\nShe went to the door and called to the woman who, during Gionetta’s\r\npretended illness, had been induced to supply her place; but the\r\nhireling answered not. She flew through the chambers to search for her\r\nin vain,--the hireling had caught Gionetta’s fears, and vanished. What\r\nwas to be done? The case was urgent,--the doctor had declared not a\r\nmoment should be lost in obtaining his attendance; she must leave her\r\nfather,--she must go herself! She crept back into the room,--the anodyne\r\nseemed already to have taken benign effect; the patient’s eyes were\r\nclosed, and he breathed regularly, as in sleep. She stole away, threw\r\nher veil over her face, and hurried from the house.\r\n\r\nNow the anodyne had not produced the effect which it appeared to\r\nhave done; instead of healthful sleep, it had brought on a kind of\r\nlight-headed somnolence, in which the mind, preternaturally restless,\r\nwandered about its accustomed haunts, waking up its old familiar\r\ninstincts and inclinations. It was not sleep,--it was not delirium;\r\nit was the dream-wakefulness which opium sometimes induces, when every\r\nnerve grows tremulously alive, and creates a corresponding activity in\r\nthe frame, to which it gives a false and hectic vigour. Pisani missed\r\nsomething,--what, he scarcely knew; it was a combination of the two\r\nwants most essential to his mental life,--the voice of his wife, the\r\ntouch of his Familiar. He rose,--he left his bed, he leisurely put on\r\nhis old dressing-robe, in which he had been wont to compose. He smiled\r\ncomplacently as the associations connected with the garment came over\r\nhis memory; he walked tremulously across the room, and entered the small\r\ncabinet next to his chamber, in which his wife had been accustomed more\r\noften to watch than sleep, when illness separated her from his side. The\r\nroom was desolate and void. He looked round wistfully, and muttered\r\nto himself, and then proceeded regularly, and with a noiseless step,\r\nthrough the chambers of the silent house, one by one.\r\n\r\nHe came at last to that in which old Gionetta--faithful to her own\r\nsafety, if nothing else--nursed herself, in the remotest corner of the\r\nhouse, from the danger of infection. As he glided in,--wan, emaciated,\r\nwith an uneasy, anxious, searching look in his haggard eyes,--the old\r\nwoman shrieked aloud, and fell at his feet. He bent over her, passed his\r\nthin hands along her averted face, shook his head, and said in a hollow\r\nvoice,--\r\n\r\n“I cannot find them; where are they?”\r\n\r\n“Who, dear master? Oh, have compassion on yourself; they are not here.\r\nBlessed saints! this is terrible; he has touched me; I am dead!”\r\n\r\n“Dead! who is dead? Is any one dead?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! don’t talk so; you must know it well: my poor mistress,--she caught\r\nthe fever from you; it is infectious enough to kill a whole city. San\r\nGennaro protect me! My poor mistress, she is dead,--buried, too; and\r\nI, your faithful Gionetta, woe is me! Go, go--to--to bed again, dearest\r\nmaster,--go!”\r\n\r\nThe poor musician stood for one moment mute and unmoving, then a slight\r\nshiver ran through his frame; he turned and glided back, silent and\r\nspectre-like, as he had entered. He came into the room where he had been\r\naccustomed to compose,--where his wife, in her sweet patience, had so\r\noften sat by his side, and praised and flattered when the world had but\r\njeered and scorned. In one corner he found the laurel-wreath she had\r\nplaced on his brows that happy night of fame and triumph; and near it,\r\nhalf hid by her mantilla, lay in its case the neglected instrument.\r\n\r\nViola was not long gone: she had found the physician; she returned with\r\nhim; and as they gained the threshold, they heard a strain of music from\r\nwithin,--a strain of piercing, heart-rending anguish. It was not like\r\nsome senseless instrument, mechanical in its obedience to a human\r\nhand,--it was as some spirit calling, in wail and agony from the forlorn\r\nshades, to the angels it beheld afar beyond the Eternal Gulf. They\r\nexchanged glances of dismay. They hurried into the house; they hastened\r\ninto the room. Pisani turned, and his look, full of ghastly intelligence\r\nand stern command, awed them back. The black mantilla, the faded\r\nlaurel-leaf, lay there before him. Viola’s heart guessed all at a single\r\nglance; she sprung to his knees; she clasped them,--“Father, father, _I_\r\nam left thee still!”\r\n\r\nThe wail ceased,--the note changed; with a confused association--half of\r\nthe man, half of the artist--the anguish, still a melody, was connected\r\nwith sweeter sounds and thoughts. The nightingale had escaped the\r\npursuit,--soft, airy, bird-like, thrilled the delicious notes a moment,\r\nand then died away. The instrument fell to the floor, and its chords\r\nsnapped. You heard that sound through the silence. The artist looked\r\non his kneeling child, and then on the broken chords... “Bury me by her\r\nside,” he said, in a very calm, low voice; “and THAT by mine.” And with\r\nthese words his whole frame became rigid, as if turned to stone. The\r\nlast change passed over his face. He fell to the ground, sudden and\r\nheavy. The chords THERE, too,--the chords of the human instrument were\r\nsnapped asunder. As he fell, his robe brushed the laurel-wreath, and\r\nthat fell also, near but not in reach of the dead man’s nerveless hand.\r\n\r\nBroken instrument, broken heart, withered laurel-wreath!--the setting\r\nsun through the vine-clad lattice streamed on all! So smiles the eternal\r\nNature on the wrecks of all that make life glorious! And not a sun that\r\nsets not somewhere on the silenced music,--on the faded laurel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.X.\r\n\r\n     Che difesa miglior ch’ usbergo e scudo,\r\n     E la santa innocenza al petto ignudo!\r\n     “Ger.

That famous Steiner--primeval Titan of the great Tyrolese\r\nrace--often hast thou sought to scale the heavens, and therefore must\r\nthou, like the meaner children of men, descend to the dismal Hades!\r\nHarder fate for thee than thy mortal master. For THY soul sleeps with\r\nthee in the coffin. And the music that belongs to HIS, separate from\r\nthe instrument, ascends on high, to be heard often by a daughter’s pious\r\nears when the heaven is serene and the earth sad. For there is a sense\r\nof hearing that the vulgar know not. And the voices of the dead breathe\r\nsoft and frequent to those who can unite the memory with the faith.\r\n\r\nAnd now Viola is alone in the world,--alone in the home where loneliness\r\nhad seemed from the cradle a thing that was not of nature. And at\r\nfirst the solitude and the stillness were insupportable. Have you, ye\r\nmourners, to whom these sibyl leaves, weird with many a dark enigma,\r\nshall be borne, have you not felt that when the death of some best-loved\r\none has made the hearth desolate,--have you not felt as if the gloom of\r\nthe altered home was too heavy for thought to bear?--you would leave it,\r\nthough a palace, even for a cabin. And yet,--sad to say,--when you obey\r\nthe impulse, when you fly from the walls, when in the strange place in\r\nwhich you seek your refuge nothing speaks to you of the lost, have ye\r\nnot felt again a yearning for that very food to memory which was just\r\nbefore but bitterness and gall? Is it not almost impious and profane\r\nto abandon that dear hearth to strangers? And the desertion of the home\r\nwhere your parents dwelt, and blessed you, upbraids your conscience as\r\nif you had sold their tombs.\r\n\r\nBeautiful was the Etruscan superstition that the ancestors become the\r\nhousehold gods. Deaf is the heart to which the Lares call from the\r\ndesolate floors in vain. At first Viola had, in her intolerable anguish,\r\ngratefully welcomed the refuge which the house and family of a kindly\r\nneighbour, much attached to her father, and who was one of the orchestra\r\nthat Pisani shall perplex no more, had proffered to the orphan. But the\r\ncompany of the unfamiliar in our grief, the consolation of the stranger,\r\nhow it irritates the wound! And then, to hear elsewhere the name of\r\nfather, mother, child,--as if death came alone to you,--to see elsewhere\r\nthe calm regularity of those lives united in love and order, keeping\r\naccount of happy hours, the unbroken timepiece of home, as if\r\nnowhere else the wheels were arrested, the chain shattered, the hands\r\nmotionless, the chime still! No, the grave itself does not remind us of\r\nour loss like the company of those who have no loss to mourn. Go back to\r\nthy solitude, young orphan,--go back to thy home: the sorrow that meets\r\nthee on the threshold can greet thee, even in its sadness, like the\r\nsmile upon the face of the dead. And there, from thy casement, and\r\nthere, from without thy door, thou seest still the tree, solitary as\r\nthyself, and springing from the clefts of the rock, but forcing its way\r\nto light,--as, through all sorrow, while the seasons yet can renew the\r\nverdure and bloom of youth, strives the instinct of the human heart!\r\nOnly when the sap is dried up, only when age comes on, does the sun\r\nshine in vain for man and for the tree.\r\n\r\nWeeks and months--months sad and many--again passed, and Naples will\r\nnot longer suffer its idol to seclude itself from homage. The world ever\r\nplucks us back from ourselves with a thousand arms. And again Viola’s\r\nvoice is heard upon the stage, which, mystically faithful to life, is in\r\nnought more faithful than this, that it is the appearances that fill the\r\nscene; and we pause not to ask of what realities they are the proxies.\r\nWhen the actor of Athens moved all hearts as he clasped the burial urn,\r\nand burst into broken sobs; how few, there, knew that it held the ashes\r\nof his son! Gold, as well as fame, was showered upon the young actress;\r\nbut she still kept to her simple mode of life, to her lowly home, to\r\nthe one servant whose faults, selfish as they were, Viola was too\r\ninexperienced to perceive. And it was Gionetta who had placed her when\r\nfirst born in her father’s arms! She was surrounded by every snare,\r\nwooed by every solicitation that could beset her unguarded beauty and\r\nher dangerous calling. But her modest virtue passed unsullied through\r\nthem all. It is true that she had been taught by lips now mute the\r\nmaiden duties enjoined by honour and religion. And all love that spoke\r\nnot of the altar only shocked and repelled her. But besides that, as\r\ngrief and solitude ripened her heart, and made her tremble at times\r\nto think how deeply it could feel, her vague and early visions shaped\r\nthemselves into an ideal of love. And till the ideal is found, how\r\nthe shadow that it throws before it chills us to the actual! With\r\nthat ideal, ever and ever, unconsciously, and with a certain awe and\r\nshrinking, came the shape and voice of the warning stranger. Nearly two\r\nyears had passed since he had appeared at Naples. Nothing had been heard\r\nof him, save that his vessel had been directed, some months after his\r\ndeparture, to sail for Leghorn. By the gossips of Naples, his existence,\r\nsupposed so extraordinary, was wellnigh forgotten; but the heart of\r\nViola was more faithful. Often he glided through her dreams, and\r\nwhen the wind sighed through that fantastic tree, associated with his\r\nremembrance, she started with a tremor and a blush, as if she had heard\r\nhim speak.\r\n\r\nBut amongst the train of her suitors was one to whom she listened\r\nmore gently than to the rest; partly because, perhaps, he spoke in\r\nher mother’s native tongue; partly because in his diffidence there was\r\nlittle to alarm and displease; partly because his rank, nearer to\r\nher own than that of lordlier wooers, prevented his admiration from\r\nappearing insult; partly because he himself, eloquent and a dreamer,\r\noften uttered thoughts that were kindred to those buried deepest in her\r\nmind. She began to like, perhaps to love him, but as a sister loves;\r\na sort of privileged familiarity sprung up between them. If in the\r\nEnglishman’s breast arose wild and unworthy hopes, he had not yet\r\nexpressed them. Is there danger to thee here, lone Viola, or is the\r\ndanger greater in thy unfound ideal?\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the overture to some strange and wizard spectacle, closes\r\nthis opening prelude. Wilt thou hear more? Come with thy faith prepared.\r\nI ask not the blinded eyes, but the awakened sense. As the enchanted\r\nIsle, remote from the homes of men,--\r\n\r\n“Ove alcun legno Rado, o non mai va dalle nostre sponde,”--“Ger.Lib.,”\r\n cant. xiv. 69.\r\n\r\n(Where ship seldom or never comes from our coasts.)\r\n\r\nis the space in the weary ocean of actual life to which the Muse or\r\nSibyl (ancient in years, but ever young in aspect), offers thee no\r\nunhallowed sail,--\r\n\r\n     “Quinci ella in cima a una montagna ascende\r\n     Disabitata, e d’ ombre oscura e bruna;\r\n     E par incanto a lei nevose rende\r\n     Le spalle e i fianchi; e sensa neve alcuna\r\n     Gli lascia il capo verdeggiante e vago;\r\n     E vi fonda un palagio appresso un lago.”\r\n\r\n     (There, she a mountain’s lofty peak ascends, Unpeopled,\r\n     shady, shagg’d with forests brown, Whose sides, by power of\r\n     magic, half-way down She heaps with slippery ice and frost\r\n     and snow, But sunshiny and verdant leaves the crown With\r\n     orange-woods and myrtles,--speaks, and lo!

Lib.,” c. iv. v.\r\n\r\n     (Centaurs and Sphinxes and pallid Gorgons.)\r\n\r\nOne moonlit night, in the Gardens at Naples, some four or five gentleman\r\nwere seated under a tree, drinking their sherbet, and listening, in the\r\nintervals of conversation, to the music which enlivened that gay and\r\nfavourite resort of an indolent population. One of this little party was\r\na young Englishman, who had been the life of the whole group, but who,\r\nfor the last few moments, had sunk into a gloomy and abstracted reverie.\r\nOne of his countrymen observed this sudden gloom, and, tapping him on\r\nthe back, said, “What ails you, Glyndon? Are you ill? You have grown\r\nquite pale,--you tremble. Is it a sudden chill? You had better go home:\r\nthese Italian nights are often dangerous to our English constitutions.”\r\n\r\n“No, I am well now; it was a passing shudder. I cannot account for it\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nA man, apparently of about thirty years of age, and of a mien and\r\ncountenance strikingly superior to those around him, turned abruptly,\r\nand looked steadfastly at Glyndon.\r\n\r\n“I think I understand what you mean,” said he; “and perhaps,” he added,\r\nwith a grave smile, “I could explain it better than yourself.” Here,\r\nturning to the others, he added, “You must often have felt, gentlemen,\r\neach and all of you, especially when sitting alone at night, a strange\r\nand unaccountable sensation of coldness and awe creep over you; your\r\nblood curdles, and the heart stands still; the limbs shiver; the hair\r\nbristles; you are afraid to look up, to turn your eyes to the darker\r\ncorners of the room; you have a horrible fancy that something unearthly\r\nis at hand; presently the whole spell, if I may so call it, passes away,\r\nand you are ready to laugh at your own weakness. Have you not often felt\r\nwhat I have thus imperfectly described?--if so, you can understand what\r\nour young friend has just experienced, even amidst the delights of this\r\nmagical scene, and amidst the balmy whispers of a July night.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied Glyndon, evidently much surprised, “you have defined\r\nexactly the nature of that shudder which came over me. But how could my\r\nmanner be so faithful an index to my impressions?”\r\n\r\n“I know the signs of the visitation,” returned the stranger, gravely;\r\n“they are not to be mistaken by one of my experience.”\r\n\r\nAll the gentleman present then declared that they could comprehend, and\r\nhad felt, what the stranger had described.\r\n\r\n“According to one of our national superstitions,” said Mervale, the\r\nEnglishman who had first addressed Glyndon, “the moment you so feel your\r\nblood creep, and your hair stand on end, some one is walking over the\r\nspot which shall be your grave.”\r\n\r\n“There are in all lands different superstitions to account for so common\r\nan occurrence,” replied the stranger: “one sect among the Arabians holds\r\nthat at that instant God is deciding the hour either of your death,\r\nor of some one dear to you. The African savage, whose imagination is\r\ndarkened by the hideous rites of his gloomy idolatry, believes that the\r\nEvil Spirit is pulling you towards him by the hair: so do the Grotesque\r\nand the Terrible mingle with each other.”\r\n\r\n“It is evidently a mere physical accident,--a derangement of the\r\nstomach, a chill of the blood,” said a young Neapolitan, with whom\r\nGlyndon had formed a slight acquaintance.\r\n\r\n“Then why is it always coupled in all nations with some superstitious\r\npresentiment or terror,--some connection between the material frame and\r\nthe supposed world without us? For my part, I think--”\r\n\r\n“Ay, what do you think, sir?” asked Glyndon, curiously.\r\n\r\n“I think,” continued the stranger, “that it is the repugnance and\r\nhorror with which our more human elements recoil from something, indeed,\r\ninvisible, but antipathetic to our own nature; and from a knowledge of\r\nwhich we are happily secured by the imperfection of our senses.”\r\n\r\n“You are a believer in spirits, then?” said Mervale, with an incredulous\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“Nay, it was not precisely of spirits that I spoke; but there may be\r\nforms of matter as invisible and impalpable to us as the animalculae\r\nin the air we breathe,--in the water that plays in yonder basin. Such\r\nbeings may have passions and powers like our own--as the animalculae to\r\nwhich I have compared them. The monster that lives and dies in a drop of\r\nwater--carnivorous, insatiable, subsisting on the creatures minuter than\r\nhimself--is not less deadly in his wrath, less ferocious in his nature,\r\nthan the tiger of the desert. There may be things around us that would\r\nbe dangerous and hostile to men, if Providence had not placed a wall\r\nbetween them and us, merely by different modifications of matter.”\r\n\r\n“And think you that wall never can be removed?” asked young Glyndon,\r\nabruptly. “Are the traditions of sorcerer and wizard, universal and\r\nimmemorial as they are, merely fables?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps yes,--perhaps no,” answered the stranger, indifferently. “But\r\nwho, in an age in which the reason has chosen its proper bounds, would\r\nbe mad enough to break the partition that divides him from the boa and\r\nthe lion,--to repine at and rebel against the law which confines the\r\nshark to the great deep? Enough of these idle speculations.”\r\n\r\nHere the stranger rose, summoned the attendant, paid for his sherbet,\r\nand, bowing slightly to the company, soon disappeared among the trees.\r\n\r\n“Who is that gentleman?” asked Glyndon, eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe rest looked at each other, without replying, for some moments.\r\n\r\n“I never saw him before,” said Mervale, at last.\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I.”\r\n\r\n“I know him well,” said the Neapolitan, who was, indeed, the Count\r\nCetoxa. “If you remember, it was as my companion that he joined you.\r\nHe visited Naples about two years ago, and has recently returned; he is\r\nvery rich,--indeed, enormously so. A most agreeable person. I am sorry\r\nto hear him talk so strangely to-night; it serves to encourage the\r\nvarious foolish reports that are circulated concerning him.”\r\n\r\n“And surely,” said another Neapolitan, “the circumstance that occurred\r\nbut the other day, so well known to yourself, Cetoxa, justifies the\r\nreports you pretend to deprecate.”\r\n\r\n“Myself and my countryman,” said Glyndon, “mix so little in Neapolitan\r\nsociety, that we lose much that appears well worthy of lively interest.\r\nMay I enquire what are the reports, and what is the circumstance you\r\nrefer to?”\r\n\r\n“As to the reports, gentlemen,” said Cetoxa, courteously, addressing\r\nhimself to the two Englishmen, “it may suffice to observe, that they\r\nattribute to the Signor Zanoni certain qualities which everybody desires\r\nfor himself, but damns any one else for possessing. The incident Signor\r\nBelgioso alludes to, illustrates these qualities, and is, I must own,\r\nsomewhat startling. You probably play, gentlemen?” (Here Cetoxa paused;\r\nand as both Englishmen had occasionally staked a few scudi at the public\r\ngaming-tables, they bowed assent to the conjecture.) Cetoxa continued.\r\n“Well, then, not many days since, and on the very day that Zanoni\r\nreturned to Naples, it so happened that I had been playing pretty high,\r\nand had lost considerably. I rose from the table, resolved no longer to\r\ntempt fortune, when I suddenly perceived Zanoni, whose acquaintance I\r\nhad before made (and who, I may say, was under some slight obligation to\r\nme), standing by, a spectator. Ere I could express my gratification at\r\nthis unexpected recognition, he laid his hand on my arm. ‘You have lost\r\nmuch,’ said he; ‘more than you can afford. For my part, I dislike play;\r\nyet I wish to have some interest in what is going on. Will you play this\r\nsum for me? the risk is mine,--the half profits yours.’ I was startled,\r\nas you may suppose, at such an address; but Zanoni had an air and tone\r\nwith him it was impossible to resist; besides, I was burning to recover\r\nmy losses, and should not have risen had I had any money left about me.\r\nI told him I would accept his offer, provided we shared the risk as well\r\nas profits. ‘As you will,’ said he, smiling; ‘we need have no scruple,\r\nfor you will be sure to win.’ I sat down; Zanoni stood behind me; my\r\nluck rose,--I invariably won. In fact, I rose from the table a rich\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“There can be no foul play at the public tables, especially when foul\r\nplay would make against the bank?” This question was put by Glyndon.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” replied the count. “But our good fortune was, indeed,\r\nmarvellous,--so extraordinary that a Sicilian (the Sicilians are all\r\nill-bred, bad-tempered fellows) grew angry and insolent. ‘Sir,’ said he,\r\nturning to my new friend, ‘you have no business to stand so near to\r\nthe table. I do not understand this; you have not acted fairly.’ Zanoni\r\nreplied, with great composure, that he had done nothing against the\r\nrules,--that he was very sorry that one man could not win without\r\nanother man losing; and that he could not act unfairly, even if disposed\r\nto do so. The Sicilian took the stranger’s mildness for apprehension,\r\nand blustered more loudly. In fact, he rose from the table, and\r\nconfronted Zanoni in a manner that, to say the least of it, was\r\nprovoking to any gentleman who has some quickness of temper, or some\r\nskill with the small-sword.”\r\n\r\n“And,” interrupted Belgioso, “the most singular part of the whole to me\r\nwas, that this Zanoni, who stood opposite to where I sat, and whose face\r\nI distinctly saw, made no remark, showed no resentment. He fixed his\r\neyes steadfastly on the Sicilian; never shall I forget that look! it is\r\nimpossible to describe it,--it froze the blood in my veins. The Sicilian\r\nstaggered back as if struck. I saw him tremble; he sank on the bench.\r\nAnd then--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, then,” said Cetoxa, “to my infinite surprise, our gentleman, thus\r\ndisarmed by a look from Zanoni, turned his whole anger upon me, THE--but\r\nperhaps you do not know, gentlemen, that I have some repute with my\r\nweapon?”\r\n\r\n“The best swordsman in Italy,” said Belgioso.\r\n\r\n“Before I could guess why or wherefore,” resumed Cetoxa, “I found myself\r\nin the garden behind the house, with Ughelli (that was the Sicilian’s\r\nname) facing me, and five or six gentlemen, the witnesses of the duel\r\nabout to take place, around. Zanoni beckoned me aside. ‘This man will\r\nfall,’ said he. ‘When he is on the ground, go to him, and ask whether he\r\nwill be buried by the side of his father in the church of San Gennaro?’\r\n‘Do you then know his family?’ I asked with great surprise. Zanoni made\r\nme no answer, and the next moment I was engaged with the Sicilian. To\r\ndo him justice, his imbrogliato was magnificent, and a swifter lounger\r\nnever crossed a sword; nevertheless,” added Cetoxa, with a pleasing\r\nmodesty, “he was run through the body. I went up to him; he could\r\nscarcely speak. ‘Have you any request to make,--any affairs to settle?’\r\nHe shook his head. ‘Where would you wish to be interred?’ He pointed\r\ntowards the Sicilian coast. ‘What!’ said I, in surprise, ‘NOT by the\r\nside of your father, in the church of San Gennaro?’ As I spoke, his face\r\naltered terribly; he uttered a piercing shriek,--the blood gushed from\r\nhis mouth, and he fell dead. The most strange part of the story is to\r\ncome. We buried him in the church of San Gennaro. In doing so, we took\r\nup his father’s coffin; the lid came off in moving it, and the skeleton\r\nwas visible. In the hollow of the skull we found a very slender wire of\r\nsharp steel; this caused surprise and inquiry. The father, who was rich\r\nand a miser, had died suddenly, and been buried in haste, owing, it\r\nwas said, to the heat of the weather. Suspicion once awakened, the\r\nexamination became minute. The old man’s servant was questioned, and at\r\nlast confessed that the son had murdered the sire. The contrivance was\r\ningenious: the wire was so slender that it pierced to the brain,\r\nand drew but one drop of blood, which the grey hairs concealed. The\r\naccomplice will be executed.”\r\n\r\n“And Zanoni,--did he give evidence, did he account for--”\r\n\r\n“No,” interrupted the count: “he declared that he had by accident\r\nvisited the church that morning; that he had observed the tombstone of\r\nthe Count Ughelli; that his guide had told him the count’s son was in\r\nNaples,--a spendthrift and a gambler. While we were at play, he had\r\nheard the count mentioned by name at the table; and when the challenge\r\nwas given and accepted, it had occurred to him to name the place of\r\nburial, by an instinct which he either could not or would not account\r\nfor.”\r\n\r\n“A very lame story,” said Mervale.\r\n\r\n“Yes! but we Italians are superstitious,--the alleged instinct was\r\nregarded by many as the whisper of Providence. The next day the stranger\r\nbecame an object of universal interest and curiosity. His wealth, his\r\nmanner of living, his extraordinary personal beauty, have assisted also\r\nto make him the rage; besides, I have had the pleasure in introducing so\r\neminent a person to our gayest cavaliers and our fairest ladies.”\r\n\r\n“A most interesting narrative,” said Mervale, rising. “Come, Glyndon;\r\nshall we seek our hotel? It is almost daylight. Adieu, signor!”\r\n\r\n“What think you of this story?” said Glyndon, as the young men walked\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\n“Why, it is very clear that this Zanoni is some imposter,--some clever\r\nrogue; and the Neapolitan shares the booty, and puffs him off with all\r\nthe hackneyed charlatanism of the marvellous. An unknown adventurer gets\r\ninto society by being made an object of awe and curiosity; he is more\r\nthan ordinarily handsome, and the women are quite content to receive him\r\nwithout any other recommendation than his own face and Cetoxa’s fables.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot agree with you. Cetoxa, though a gambler and a rake, is a\r\nnobleman of birth and high repute for courage and honour. Besides,\r\nthis stranger, with his noble presence and lofty air,--so calm, so\r\nunobtrusive,--has nothing in common with the forward garrulity of an\r\nimposter.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Glyndon, pardon me; but you have not yet acquired any knowledge\r\nof the world! The stranger makes the best of a fine person, and his\r\ngrand air is but a trick of the trade. But to change the subject,--how\r\nadvances the love affair?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Viola could not see me to-day.”\r\n\r\n“You must not marry her. What would they all say at home?”\r\n\r\n“Let us enjoy the present,” said Glyndon, with vivacity; “we are young,\r\nrich, good-looking; let us not think of to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo, Glyndon! Here we are at the hotel. Sleep sound, and don’t dream\r\nof Signor Zanoni.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.II.\r\n\r\n     Prende, giovine audace e impaziente,\r\n     L’occasione offerta avidamente.\r\n     “Ger. Lib.,” c. vi. xxix.\r\n\r\n     (Take, youth, bold and impatient, the offered occasion eagerly.)\r\n\r\nClarence Glyndon was a young man of fortune, not large, but easy and\r\nindependent. His parents were dead, and his nearest relation was an\r\nonly sister, left in England under the care of her aunt, and many years\r\nyounger than himself. Early in life he had evinced considerable promise\r\nin the art of painting, and rather from enthusiasm than any pecuniary\r\nnecessity for a profession, he determined to devote himself to a\r\ncareer in which the English artist generally commences with rapture\r\nand historical composition, to conclude with avaricious calculation and\r\nportraits of Alderman Simpkins. Glyndon was supposed by his friends to\r\npossess no inconsiderable genius; but it was of a rash and presumptuous\r\norder. He was averse from continuous and steady labour, and his ambition\r\nrather sought to gather the fruit than to plant the tree. In common with\r\nmany artists in their youth, he was fond of pleasure and excitement,\r\nyielding with little forethought to whatever impressed his fancy or\r\nappealed to his passions. He had travelled through the more celebrated\r\ncities of Europe, with the avowed purpose and sincere resolution of\r\nstudying the divine masterpieces of his art. But in each, pleasure had\r\ntoo often allured him from ambition, and living beauty distracted his\r\nworship from the senseless canvas. Brave, adventurous, vain, restless,\r\ninquisitive, he was ever involved in wild projects and pleasant\r\ndangers,--the creature of impulse and the slave of imagination.\r\n\r\nIt was then the period when a feverish spirit of change was working\r\nits way to that hideous mockery of human aspirations, the Revolution\r\nof France; and from the chaos into which were already jarring the\r\nsanctities of the World’s Venerable Belief, arose many shapeless and\r\nunformed chimeras. Need I remind the reader that, while that was the day\r\nfor polished scepticism and affected wisdom, it was the day also for the\r\nmost egregious credulity and the most mystical superstitions,--the day\r\nin which magnetism and magic found converts amongst the disciples of\r\nDiderot; when prophecies were current in every mouth; when the salon\r\nof a philosophical deist was converted into an Heraclea, in which\r\nnecromancy professed to conjure up the shadows of the dead; when the\r\nCrosier and the Book were ridiculed, and Mesmer and Cagliostro were\r\nbelieved. In that Heliacal Rising, heralding the new sun before which\r\nall vapours were to vanish, stalked from their graves in the feudal\r\nages all the phantoms that had flitted before the eyes of Paracelsus\r\nand Agrippa. Dazzled by the dawn of the Revolution, Glyndon was yet more\r\nattracted by its strange accompaniments; and natural it was with him, as\r\nwith others, that the fancy which ran riot amidst the hopes of a social\r\nUtopia, should grasp with avidity all that promised, out of the dusty\r\ntracks of the beaten science, the bold discoveries of some marvellous\r\nElysium.\r\n\r\nIn his travels he had listened with vivid interest, at least, if\r\nnot with implicit belief, to the wonders told of each more renowned\r\nGhost-seer, and his mind was therefore prepared for the impression which\r\nthe mysterious Zanoni at first sight had produced upon it.\r\n\r\nThere might be another cause for this disposition to credulity. A\r\nremote ancestor of Glyndon’s on the mother’s side, had achieved no\r\ninconsiderable reputation as a philosopher and alchemist. Strange\r\nstories were afloat concerning this wise progenitor. He was said to\r\nhave lived to an age far exceeding the allotted boundaries of mortal\r\nexistence, and to have preserved to the last the appearance of middle\r\nlife. He had died at length, it was supposed, of grief for the sudden\r\ndeath of a great-grandchild, the only creature he had ever appeared to\r\nlove. The works of this philosopher, though rare, were extant, and found\r\nin the library of Glyndon’s home. Their Platonic mysticism, their bold\r\nassertions, the high promises that might be detected through their\r\nfigurative and typical phraseology, had early made a deep impression on\r\nthe young imagination of Clarence Glyndon. His parents, not alive to the\r\nconsequences of encouraging fancies which the very enlightenment of the\r\nage appeared to them sufficient to prevent or dispel, were fond, in the\r\nlong winter nights, of conversing on the traditional history of this\r\ndistinguished progenitor. And Clarence thrilled with a fearful pleasure\r\nwhen his mother playfully detected a striking likeness between the\r\nfeatures of the young heir and the faded portrait of the alchemist that\r\noverhung their mantelpiece, and was the boast of their household and the\r\nadmiration of their friends,--the child is, indeed, more often than we\r\nthink for, “the father of the man.”\r\n\r\nI have said that Glyndon was fond of pleasure. Facile, as genius\r\never must be, to cheerful impression, his careless artist-life, ere\r\nartist-life settles down to labour, had wandered from flower to flower.\r\nHe had enjoyed, almost to the reaction of satiety, the gay revelries of\r\nNaples, when he fell in love with the face and voice of Viola Pisani.\r\nBut his love, like his ambition, was vague and desultory. It did not\r\nsatisfy his whole heart and fill up his whole nature; not from want of\r\nstrong and noble passions, but because his mind was not yet matured and\r\nsettled enough for their development. As there is one season for the\r\nblossom, another for the fruit; so it is not till the bloom of fancy\r\nbegins to fade, that the heart ripens to the passions that the bloom\r\nprecedes and foretells. Joyous alike at his lonely easel or amidst his\r\nboon companions, he had not yet known enough of sorrow to love deeply.\r\nFor man must be disappointed with the lesser things of life before\r\nhe can comprehend the full value of the greatest. It is the shallow\r\nsensualists of France, who, in their salon-language, call love “a\r\nfolly,”--love, better understood, is wisdom. Besides, the world was too\r\nmuch with Clarence Glyndon. His ambition of art was associated with the\r\napplause and estimation of that miserable minority of the surface that\r\nwe call the Public.\r\n\r\nLike those who deceive, he was ever fearful of being himself the dupe.\r\nHe distrusted the sweet innocence of Viola. He could not venture the\r\nhazard of seriously proposing marriage to an Italian actress; but the\r\nmodest dignity of the girl, and something good and generous in his own\r\nnature, had hitherto made him shrink from any more worldly but less\r\nhonourable designs. Thus the familiarity between them seemed rather that\r\nof kindness and regard than passion. He attended the theatre; he stole\r\nbehind the scenes to converse with her; he filled his portfolio with\r\ncountless sketches of a beauty that charmed him as an artist as well as\r\nlover; and day after day he floated on through a changing sea of\r\ndoubt and irresolution, of affection and distrust. The last, indeed,\r\nconstantly sustained against his better reason by the sober admonitions\r\nof Mervale, a matter-of-fact man!\r\n\r\nThe day following that eve on which this section of my story opens,\r\nGlyndon was riding alone by the shores of the Neapolitan sea, on the\r\nother side of the Cavern of Posilipo. It was past noon; the sun had lost\r\nits early fervour, and a cool breeze sprung up voluptuously from the\r\nsparkling sea. Bending over a fragment of stone near the roadside,\r\nhe perceived the form of a man; and when he approached, he recognised\r\nZanoni.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman saluted him courteously. “Have you discovered some\r\nantique?” said he, with a smile; “they are common as pebbles on this\r\nroad.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Zanoni; “it was but one of those antiques that have\r\ntheir date, indeed, from the beginning of the world, but which Nature\r\neternally withers and renews.” So saying, he showed Glyndon a small herb\r\nwith a pale-blue flower, and then placed it carefully in his bosom.\r\n\r\n“You are an herbalist?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“It is, I am told, a study full of interest.”\r\n\r\n“To those who understand it, doubtless.”\r\n\r\n“Is the knowledge, then, so rare?”\r\n\r\n“Rare! The deeper knowledge is perhaps rather, among the arts, LOST to\r\nthe modern philosophy of commonplace and surface! Do you imagine there\r\nwas no foundation for those traditions which come dimly down from\r\nremoter ages,--as shells now found on the mountain-tops inform us where\r\nthe seas have been? What was the old Colchian magic, but the minute\r\nstudy of Nature in her lowliest works? What the fable of Medea, but a\r\nproof of the powers that may be extracted from the germ and leaf? The\r\nmost gifted of all the Priestcrafts, the mysterious sisterhoods of Cuth,\r\nconcerning whose incantations Learning vainly bewilders itself amidst\r\nthe maze of legends, sought in the meanest herbs what, perhaps, the\r\nBabylonian Sages explored in vain amidst the loftiest stars. Tradition\r\nyet tells you that there existed a race (“Plut. Symp.” l. 5. c. 7.) who\r\ncould slay their enemies from afar, without weapon, without movement.\r\nThe herb that ye tread on may have deadlier powers than your engineers\r\ncan give to their mightiest instruments of war. Can you guess that to\r\nthese Italian shores, to the old Circaean Promontory, came the Wise\r\nfrom the farthest East, to search for plants and simples which your\r\nPharmacists of the Counter would fling from them as weeds? The first\r\nherbalists--the master chemists of the world--were the tribe that\r\nthe ancient reverence called by the name of Titans. (Syncellus, page\r\n14.--“Chemistry the Invention of the Giants.”) I remember once, by the\r\nHebrus, in the reign of -- But this talk,” said Zanoni, checking himself\r\nabruptly, and with a cold smile, “serves only to waste your time and my\r\nown.” He paused, looked steadily at Glyndon, and continued, “Young man,\r\nthink you that vague curiosity will supply the place of earnest labour?\r\nI read your heart. You wish to know me, and not this humble herb: but\r\npass on; your desire cannot be satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“You have not the politeness of your countrymen,” said Glyndon, somewhat\r\ndiscomposed. “Suppose I were desirous to cultivate your acquaintance,\r\nwhy should you reject my advances?”\r\n\r\n“I reject no man’s advances,” answered Zanoni; “I must know them if they\r\nso desire; but ME, in return, they can never comprehend. If you ask my\r\nacquaintance, it is yours; but I would warn you to shun me.”\r\n\r\n“And why are you, then, so dangerous?”\r\n\r\n“On this earth, men are often, without their own agency, fated to be\r\ndangerous to others. If I were to predict your fortune by the vain\r\ncalculations of the astrologer, I should tell you, in their despicable\r\njargon, that my planet sat darkly in your house of life. Cross me not,\r\nif you can avoid it. I warn you now for the first time and last.”\r\n\r\n“You despise the astrologers, yet you utter a jargon as mysterious as\r\ntheirs. I neither gamble nor quarrel; why, then, should I fear you?”\r\n\r\n“As you will; I have done.”\r\n\r\n“Let me speak frankly,--your conversation last night interested and\r\nperplexed me.”\r\n\r\n“I know it: minds like yours are attracted by mystery.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon was piqued at these words, though in the tone in which they were\r\nspoken there was no contempt.\r\n\r\n“I see you do not consider me worthy of your friendship. Be it so.\r\nGood-day!”\r\n\r\nZanoni coldly replied to the salutation; and as the Englishman rode on,\r\nreturned to his botanical employment.\r\n\r\nThe same night, Glyndon went, as usual, to the theatre. He was standing\r\nbehind the scenes watching Viola, who was on the stage in one of her\r\nmost brilliant parts. The house resounded with applause. Glyndon was\r\ntransported with a young man’s passion and a young man’s pride: “This\r\nglorious creature,” thought he, “may yet be mine.”\r\n\r\nHe felt, while thus wrapped in delicious reverie, a slight touch upon\r\nhis shoulder; he turned, and beheld Zanoni. “You are in danger,” said\r\nthe latter. “Do not walk home to-night; or if you do, go not alone.”\r\n\r\nBefore Glyndon recovered from his surprise, Zanoni disappeared; and when\r\nthe Englishman saw him again, he was in the box of one of the Neapolitan\r\nnobles, where Glyndon could not follow him.\r\n\r\nViola now left the stage, and Glyndon accosted her with an unaccustomed\r\nwarmth of gallantry. But Viola, contrary to her gentle habit, turned\r\nwith an evident impatience from the address of her lover. Taking aside\r\nGionetta, who was her constant attendant at the theatre, she said, in an\r\nearnest whisper,--\r\n\r\n“Oh, Gionetta! He is here again!--the stranger of whom I spoke to\r\nthee!--and again, he alone, of the whole theatre, withholds from me his\r\napplause.”\r\n\r\n“Which is he, my darling?” said the old woman, with fondness in her\r\nvoice. “He must indeed be dull--not worth a thought.”\r\n\r\nThe actress drew Gionetta nearer to the stage, and pointed out to her a\r\nman in one of the boxes, conspicuous amongst all else by the simplicity\r\nof his dress, and the extraordinary beauty of his features.\r\n\r\n“Not worth a thought, Gionetta!” repeated Viola,--“Not worth a thought!\r\nAlas, not to think of him, seems the absence of thought itself!”\r\n\r\nThe prompter summoned the Signora Pisani. “Find out his name, Gionetta,”\r\n said she, moving slowly to the stage, and passing by Glyndon, who gazed\r\nat her with a look of sorrowful reproach.\r\n\r\nThe scene on which the actress now entered was that of the final\r\ncatastrophe, wherein all her remarkable powers of voice and art were\r\npre-eminently called forth. The house hung on every word with breathless\r\nworship; but the eyes of Viola sought only those of one calm and unmoved\r\nspectator; she exerted herself as if inspired. Zanoni listened, and\r\nobserved her with an attentive gaze, but no approval escaped his lips;\r\nno emotion changed the expression of his cold and half-disdainful\r\naspect. Viola, who was in the character of one who loved, but without\r\nreturn, never felt so acutely the part she played. Her tears were\r\ntruthful; her passion that of nature: it was almost too terrible to\r\nbehold. She was borne from the stage exhausted and insensible, amidst\r\nsuch a tempest of admiring rapture as Continental audiences alone can\r\nraise. The crowd stood up, handkerchiefs waved, garlands and flowers\r\nwere thrown on the stage,--men wiped their eyes, and women sobbed aloud.\r\n\r\n“By heavens!” said a Neapolitan of great rank, “She has fired me beyond\r\nendurance. To-night--this very night--she shall be mine! You have\r\narranged all, Mascari?”\r\n\r\n“All, signor. And the young Englishman?”\r\n\r\n“The presuming barbarian! As I before told thee, let him bleed for his\r\nfolly. I will have no rival.”\r\n\r\n“But an Englishman! There is always a search after the bodies of the\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\n“Fool! is not the sea deep enough, or the earth secret enough, to hide\r\none dead man? Our ruffians are silent as the grave itself; and I!--who\r\nwould dare to suspect, to arraign the Prince di --? See to it,--this\r\nnight. I trust him to you. Robbers murder him, you understand,--the\r\ncountry swarms with them; plunder and strip him, the better to favour\r\nsuch report. Take three men; the rest shall be my escort.”\r\n\r\nMascari shrugged his shoulders, and bowed submissively.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Naples were not then so safe as now, and carriages were\r\nboth less expensive and more necessary. The vehicle which was regularly\r\nengaged by the young actress was not to be found. Gionetta, too aware of\r\nthe beauty of her mistress and the number of her admirers to contemplate\r\nwithout alarm the idea of their return on foot, communicated her\r\ndistress to Glyndon, and he besought Viola, who recovered but slowly,\r\nto accept his own carriage. Perhaps before that night she would not\r\nhave rejected so slight a service. Now, for some reason or other, she\r\nrefused. Glyndon, offended, was retiring sullenly, when Gionetta stopped\r\nhim. “Stay, signor,” said she, coaxingly: “the dear signora is not\r\nwell,--do not be angry with her; I will make her accept your offer.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon stayed, and after a few moments spent in expostulation on\r\nthe part of Gionetta, and resistance on that of Viola, the offer was\r\naccepted. Gionetta and her charge entered the carriage, and Glyndon was\r\nleft at the door of the theatre to return home on foot. The mysterious\r\nwarning of Zanoni then suddenly occurred to him; he had forgotten it\r\nin the interest of his lover’s quarrel with Viola. He thought it now\r\nadvisable to guard against danger foretold by lips so mysterious.\r\nHe looked round for some one he knew: the theatre was disgorging\r\nits crowds; they hustled, and jostled, and pressed upon him; but he\r\nrecognised no familiar countenance. While pausing irresolute, he heard\r\nMervale’s voice calling on him, and, to his great relief, discovered his\r\nfriend making his way through the throng.\r\n\r\n“I have secured you,” said he, “a place in the Count Cetoxa’s carriage.\r\nCome along, he is waiting for us.”\r\n\r\n“How kind in you! how did you find me out?”\r\n\r\n“I met Zanoni in the passage,--‘Your friend is at the door of the\r\ntheatre,’ said he; ‘do not let him go home on foot to-night; the streets\r\nof Naples are not always safe.’ I immediately remembered that some of\r\nthe Calabrian bravos had been busy within the city the last few weeks,\r\nand suddenly meeting Cetoxa--but here he is.”\r\n\r\nFurther explanation was forbidden, for they now joined the count. As\r\nGlyndon entered the carriage and drew up the glass, he saw four men\r\nstanding apart by the pavement, who seemed to eye him with attention.\r\n\r\n“Cospetto!” cried one; “that is the Englishman!” Glyndon imperfectly\r\nheard the exclamation as the carriage drove on. He reached home in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe familiar and endearing intimacy which always exists in Italy between\r\nthe nurse and the child she has reared, and which the “Romeo and Juliet”\r\n of Shakespeare in no way exaggerates, could not but be drawn yet closer\r\nthan usual, in a situation so friendless as that of the orphan-actress.\r\nIn all that concerned the weaknesses of the heart, Gionetta had large\r\nexperience; and when, three nights before, Viola, on returning from the\r\ntheatre, had wept bitterly, the nurse had succeeded in extracting from\r\nher a confession that she had seen one,--not seen for two weary and\r\neventful years,--but never forgotten, and who, alas! had not evinced the\r\nslightest recognition of herself. Gionetta could not comprehend all the\r\nvague and innocent emotions that swelled this sorrow; but she resolved\r\nthem all, with her plain, blunt understanding, to the one sentiment\r\nof love. And here, she was well fitted to sympathise and console.\r\nConfidante to Viola’s entire and deep heart she never could be,--for\r\nthat heart never could have words for all its secrets. But such\r\nconfidence as she could obtain, she was ready to repay by the most\r\nunreproving pity and the most ready service.\r\n\r\n“Have you discovered who he is?” asked Viola, as she was now alone in\r\nthe carriage with Gionetta.\r\n\r\n“Yes; he is the celebrated Signor Zanoni, about whom all the great\r\nladies have gone mad. They say he is so rich!--oh! so much richer than\r\nany of the Inglesi!--not but what the Signor Glyndon--”\r\n\r\n“Cease!” interrupted the young actress. “Zanoni! Speak of the Englishman\r\nno more.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage was now entering that more lonely and remote part of the\r\ncity in which Viola’s house was situated, when it suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\nGionetta, in alarm, thrust her head out of the window, and perceived,\r\nby the pale light of the moon, that the driver, torn from his seat, was\r\nalready pinioned in the arms of two men; the next moment the door was\r\nopened violently, and a tall figure, masked and mantled, appeared.\r\n\r\n“Fear not, fairest Pisani,” said he, gently; “no ill shall befall you.”\r\n As he spoke, he wound his arm round the form of the fair actress, and\r\nendeavoured to lift her from the carriage. But Gionetta was no ordinary\r\nally,--she thrust back the assailant with a force that astonished him,\r\nand followed the shock by a volley of the most energetic reprobation.\r\n\r\nThe mask drew back, and composed his disordered mantle.\r\n\r\n“By the body of Bacchus!” said he, half laughing, “she is well\r\nprotected. Here, Luigi, Giovanni! seize the hag!--quick!--why loiter\r\nye?”\r\n\r\nThe mask retired from the door, and another and yet taller form\r\npresented itself. “Be calm, Viola Pisani,” said he, in a low voice;\r\n“with me you are indeed safe!” He lifted his mask as he spoke, and\r\nshowed the noble features of Zanoni.\r\n\r\n“Be calm, be hushed,--I can save you.” He vanished, leaving Viola lost\r\nin surprise, agitation, and delight. There were, in all, nine masks:\r\ntwo were engaged with the driver; one stood at the head of the\r\ncarriage-horses; a fourth guarded the well-trained steeds of the party;\r\nthree others (besides Zanoni and the one who had first accosted Viola)\r\nstood apart by a carriage drawn to the side of the road. To these three\r\nZanoni motioned; they advanced; he pointed towards the first mask, who\r\nwas in fact the Prince di --, and to his unspeakable astonishment the\r\nprince was suddenly seized from behind.\r\n\r\n“Treason!” he cried. “Treason among my own men! What means this?”\r\n\r\n“Place him in his carriage! If he resist, his blood be on his own head!”\r\n said Zanoni, calmly.\r\n\r\nHe approached the men who had detained the coachman.\r\n\r\n“You are outnumbered and outwitted,” said he; “join your lord; you are\r\nthree men,--we six, armed to the teeth. Thank our mercy that we spare\r\nyour lives. Go!”\r\n\r\nThe men gave way, dismayed. The driver remounted.\r\n\r\n“Cut the traces of their carriage and the bridles of their horses,” said\r\nZanoni, as he entered the vehicle containing Viola, which now drove on\r\nrapidly, leaving the discomfited ravisher in a state of rage and stupor\r\nimpossible to describe.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to explain this mystery to you,” said Zanoni. “I discovered\r\nthe plot against you,--no matter how; I frustrated it thus: The head of\r\nthis design is a nobleman, who has long persecuted you in vain. He\r\nand two of his creatures watched you from the entrance of the theatre,\r\nhaving directed six others to await him on the spot where you were\r\nattacked; myself and five of my servants supplied their place, and were\r\nmistaken for his own followers. I had previously ridden alone to the\r\nspot where the men were waiting, and informed them that their master\r\nwould not require their services that night. They believed me, and\r\naccordingly dispersed. I then joined my own band, whom I had left in the\r\nrear; you know all. We are at your door.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.III.\r\n\r\n     When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,\r\n     For all the day they view things unrespected;\r\n     But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,\r\n     And, darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\r\n     Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n     Zanoni followed the young Neapolitan into her house; Gionetta\r\n     vanished,--they were left alone.\r\n\r\nAlone, in that room so often filled, in the old happy days, with the\r\nwild melodies of Pisani; and now, as she saw this mysterious, haunting,\r\nyet beautiful and stately stranger, standing on the very spot where\r\nshe had sat at her father’s feet, thrilled and spellbound,--she almost\r\nthought, in her fantastic way of personifying her own airy notions,\r\nthat that spiritual Music had taken shape and life, and stood before her\r\nglorious in the image it assumed. She was unconscious all the while of\r\nher own loveliness. She had thrown aside her hood and veil; her hair,\r\nsomewhat disordered, fell over the ivory neck which the dress partially\r\ndisplayed; and as her dark eyes swam with grateful tears, and her cheek\r\nflushed with its late excitement, the god of light and music himself\r\nnever, amidst his Arcadian valleys, wooed, in his mortal guise, maiden\r\nor nymph more fair.\r\n\r\nZanoni gazed at her with a look in which admiration seemed not unmingled\r\nwith compassion. He muttered a few words to himself, and then addressed\r\nher aloud.\r\n\r\n“Viola, I have saved you from a great peril; not from dishonour only,\r\nbut perhaps from death. The Prince di --, under a weak despot and a\r\nvenal administration, is a man above the law. He is capable of every\r\ncrime; but amongst his passions he has such prudence as belongs to\r\nambition; if you were not to reconcile yourself to your shame, you would\r\nnever enter the world again to tell your tale. The ravisher has no heart\r\nfor repentance, but he has a hand that can murder. I have saved you,\r\nViola. Perhaps you would ask me wherefore?” Zanoni paused, and smiled\r\nmournfully, as he added, “You will not wrong me by the thought that he\r\nwho has preserved is not less selfish than he who would have injured.\r\nOrphan, I do not speak to you in the language of your wooers; enough\r\nthat I know pity, and am not ungrateful for affection. Why blush, why\r\ntremble at the word? I read your heart while I speak, and I see not\r\none thought that should give you shame. I say not that you love me yet;\r\nhappily, the fancy may be roused long before the heart is touched.\r\nBut it has been my fate to fascinate your eye, to influence your\r\nimagination. It is to warn you against what could bring you but sorrow,\r\nas I warned you once to prepare for sorrow itself, that I am now your\r\nguest. The Englishman, Glyndon, loves thee well,--better, perhaps, than\r\nI can ever love; if not worthy of thee, yet, he has but to know thee\r\nmore to deserve thee better. He may wed thee, he may bear thee to his\r\nown free and happy land,--the land of thy mother’s kin. Forget me; teach\r\nthyself to return and deserve his love; and I tell thee that thou wilt\r\nbe honoured and be happy.”\r\n\r\nViola listened with silent, inexpressible emotion, and burning blushes,\r\nto this strange address, and when he had concluded, she covered her face\r\nwith her hands, and wept. And yet, much as his words were calculated to\r\nhumble or irritate, to produce indignation or excite shame, those were\r\nnot the feelings with which her eyes streamed and her heart swelled. The\r\nwoman at that moment was lost in the child; and AS a child, with all its\r\nexacting, craving, yet innocent desire to be loved, weeps in unrebuking\r\nsadness when its affection is thrown austerely back upon itself,--so,\r\nwithout anger and without shame, wept Viola.\r\n\r\nZanoni contemplated her thus, as her graceful head, shadowed by its\r\nredundant tresses, bent before him; and after a moment’s pause he drew\r\nnear to her, and said, in a voice of the most soothing sweetness, and\r\nwith a half smile upon his lip,--\r\n\r\n“Do you remember, when I told you to struggle for the light, that I\r\npointed for example to the resolute and earnest tree? I did not tell\r\nyou, fair child, to take example by the moth, that would soar to the\r\nstar, but falls scorched beside the lamp. Come, I will talk to thee.\r\nThis Englishman--”\r\n\r\nViola drew herself away, and wept yet more passionately.\r\n\r\n“This Englishman is of thine own years, not far above thine own rank.\r\nThou mayst share his thoughts in life,--thou mayst sleep beside him\r\nin the same grave in death! And I--but THAT view of the future should\r\nconcern us not. Look into thy heart, and thou wilt see that till again\r\nmy shadow crossed thy path, there had grown up for this thine equal a\r\npure and calm affection that would have ripened into love. Hast thou\r\nnever pictured to thyself a home in which thy partner was thy young\r\nwooer?”\r\n\r\n“Never!” said Viola, with sudden energy,--“never but to feel that such\r\nwas not the fate ordained me. And, oh!” she continued, rising suddenly,\r\nand, putting aside the tresses that veiled her face, she fixed her eyes\r\nupon the questioner,--“and, oh! whoever thou art that thus wouldst read\r\nmy soul and shape my future, do not mistake the sentiment that, that--”\r\n she faltered an instant, and went on with downcast eyes,--“that has\r\nfascinated my thoughts to thee. Do not think that I could nourish a love\r\nunsought and unreturned. It is not love that I feel for thee, stranger.\r\nWhy should I? Thou hast never spoken to me but to admonish,--and now, to\r\nwound!” Again she paused, again her voice faltered; the tears trembled\r\non her eyelids; she brushed them away and resumed. “No, not love,--if\r\nthat be love which I have heard and read of, and sought to simulate\r\non the stage,--but a more solemn, fearful, and, it seems to me, almost\r\npreternatural attraction, which makes me associate thee, waking or\r\ndreaming, with images that at once charm and awe. Thinkest thou, if it\r\nwere love, that I could speak to thee thus; that,” she raised her looks\r\nsuddenly to his, “mine eyes could thus search and confront thine own?\r\nStranger, I ask but at times to see, to hear thee! Stranger, talk not to\r\nme of others. Forewarn, rebuke, bruise my heart, reject the not unworthy\r\ngratitude it offers thee, if thou wilt, but come not always to me as\r\nan omen of grief and trouble. Sometimes have I seen thee in my dreams\r\nsurrounded by shapes of glory and light; thy looks radiant with a\r\ncelestial joy which they wear not now. Stranger, thou hast saved me, and\r\nI thank and bless thee! Is that also a homage thou wouldst reject?”\r\n With these words, she crossed her arms meekly on her bosom, and inclined\r\nlowlily before him. Nor did her humility seem unwomanly or abject, nor\r\nthat of mistress to lover, of slave to master, but rather of a child to\r\nits guardian, of a neophyte of the old religion to her priest. Zanoni’s\r\nbrow was melancholy and thoughtful. He looked at her with a strange\r\nexpression of kindness, of sorrow, yet of tender affection, in his eyes;\r\nbut his lips were stern, and his voice cold, as he replied,--\r\n\r\n“Do you know what you ask, Viola? Do you guess the danger to\r\nyourself--perhaps to both of us--which you court? Do you know that my\r\nlife, separated from the turbulent herd of men, is one worship of the\r\nBeautiful, from which I seek to banish what the Beautiful inspires in\r\nmost? As a calamity, I shun what to man seems the fairest fate,--the\r\nlove of the daughters of earth. At present I can warn and save thee from\r\nmany evils; if I saw more of thee, would the power still be mine?\r\nYou understand me not. What I am about to add, it will be easier to\r\ncomprehend. I bid thee banish from thy heart all thought of me, but\r\nas one whom the Future cries aloud to thee to avoid. Glyndon, if thou\r\nacceptest his homage, will love thee till the tomb closes upon both. I,\r\ntoo,” he added with emotion,--“I, too, might love thee!”\r\n\r\n“You!” cried Viola, with the vehemence of a sudden impulse of delight,\r\nof rapture, which she could not suppress; but the instant after, she\r\nwould have given worlds to recall the exclamation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Viola, I might love thee; but in that love what sorrow and what\r\nchange! The flower gives perfume to the rock on whose heart it grows. A\r\nlittle while, and the flower is dead; but the rock still endures,--the\r\nsnow at its breast, the sunshine on its summit. Pause,--think well.\r\nDanger besets thee yet. For some days thou shalt be safe from thy\r\nremorseless persecutor; but the hour soon comes when thy only security\r\nwill be in flight. If the Englishman love thee worthily, thy honour will\r\nbe dear to him as his own; if not, there are yet other lands where love\r\nwill be truer, and virtue less in danger from fraud and force. Farewell;\r\nmy own destiny I cannot foresee except through cloud and shadow. I know,\r\nat least, that we shall meet again; but learn ere then, sweet flower,\r\nthat there are more genial resting-places than the rock.”\r\n\r\nHe turned as he spoke, and gained the outer door where Gionetta\r\ndiscreetly stood. Zanoni lightly laid his hand on her arm. With the gay\r\naccent of a jesting cavalier, he said,--\r\n\r\n“The Signor Glyndon woos your mistress; he may wed her. I know your love\r\nfor her. Disabuse her of any caprice for me. I am a bird ever on the\r\nwing.”\r\n\r\nHe dropped a purse into Gionetta’s hand as he spoke, and was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.IV.\r\n\r\n     Les Intelligences Celestes se font voir, et see communiquent plus\r\n     volontiers, dans le silence et dans la tranquillite de la\r\n     solitude.

(Manuscript Translation.)\r\n\r\n     (The Celestial Intelligences exhibit and explain themselves most\r\n     freely in silence and the tranquillity of solitude.  One will\r\n     have then a little chamber, or a secret cabinet, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe palace retained by Zanoni was in one of the less frequented quarters\r\nof the city. It still stands, now ruined and dismantled, a monument of\r\nthe splendour of a chivalry long since vanished from Naples, with the\r\nlordly races of the Norman and the Spaniard.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the rooms reserved for his private hours, two Indians, in\r\nthe dress of their country, received him at the threshold with the grave\r\nsalutations of the East. They had accompanied him from the far lands in\r\nwhich, according to rumour, he had for many years fixed his home.\r\nBut they could communicate nothing to gratify curiosity or justify\r\nsuspicion. They spoke no language but their own. With the exception of\r\nthese two his princely retinue was composed of the native hirelings of\r\nthe city, whom his lavish but imperious generosity made the implicit\r\ncreatures of his will. In his house, and in his habits, so far as they\r\nwere seen, there was nothing to account for the rumours which were\r\ncirculated abroad. He was not, as we are told of Albertus Magnus or the\r\ngreat Leonardo da Vinci, served by airy forms; and no brazen image, the\r\ninvention of magic mechanism, communicated to him the influences of\r\nthe stars. None of the apparatus of the alchemist--the crucible and the\r\nmetals--gave solemnity to his chambers, or accounted for his wealth;\r\nnor did he even seem to interest himself in those serener studies which\r\nmight be supposed to colour his peculiar conversation with abstract\r\nnotions, and often with recondite learning. No books spoke to him in his\r\nsolitude; and if ever he had drawn from them his knowledge, it seemed\r\nnow that the only page he read was the wide one of Nature, and that\r\na capacious and startling memory supplied the rest. Yet was there one\r\nexception to what in all else seemed customary and commonplace, and\r\nwhich, according to the authority we have prefixed to this chapter,\r\nmight indicate the follower of the occult sciences. Whether at Rome or\r\nNaples, or, in fact, wherever his abode, he selected one room remote\r\nfrom the rest of the house, which was fastened by a lock scarcely larger\r\nthan the seal of a ring, yet which sufficed to baffle the most cunning\r\ninstruments of the locksmith: at least, one of his servants, prompted by\r\nirresistible curiosity, had made the attempt in vain; and though he had\r\nfancied it was tried in the most favourable time for secrecy,--not a\r\nsoul near, in the dead of night, Zanoni himself absent from home,--yet\r\nhis superstition, or his conscience, told him the reason why the next\r\nday the Major Domo quietly dismissed him. He compensated himself for\r\nthis misfortune by spreading his own story, with a thousand amusing\r\nexaggerations. He declared that, as he approached the door, invisible\r\nhands seemed to pluck him away; and that when he touched the lock, he\r\nwas struck, as by a palsy, to the ground. One surgeon, who heard the\r\ntale, observed, to the distaste of the wonder-mongers, that possibly\r\nZanoni made a dexterous use of electricity. Howbeit, this room, once so\r\nsecured, was never entered save by Zanoni himself.\r\n\r\nThe solemn voice of Time, from the neighbouring church at last aroused\r\nthe lord of the palace from the deep and motionless reverie, rather\r\nresembling a trance than thought, in which his mind was absorbed.\r\n\r\n“It is one more sand out of the mighty hour-glass,” said he,\r\nmurmuringly, “and yet time neither adds to, nor steals from, an atom in\r\nthe Infinite! Soul of mine, the luminous, the Augoeides (Augoeides,--a\r\nword favoured by the mystical Platonists, sphaira psuches augoeides,\r\notan mete ekteinetai epi ti, mete eso suntreche mete sunizane, alla\r\nphoti lampetai, o ten aletheian opa ten panton, kai ten en aute.--Marc.\r\nAnt., lib. 2.--The sense of which beautiful sentence of the old\r\nphilosophy, which, as Bayle well observes, in his article on Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, the modern Quietists have (however impotently) sought to\r\nimitate, is to the effect that ‘the sphere of the soul is luminous when\r\nnothing external has contact with the soul itself; but when lit by its\r\nown light, it sees the truth of all things and the truth centred in\r\nitself.’), why descendest thou from thy sphere,--why from the eternal,\r\nstarlike, and passionless Serene, shrinkest thou back to the mists of\r\nthe dark sarcophagus? How long, too austerely taught that companionship\r\nwith the things that die brings with it but sorrow in its sweetness,\r\nhast thou dwelt contented with thy majestic solitude?”\r\n\r\nAs he thus murmured, one of the earliest birds that salute the dawn\r\nbroke into sudden song from amidst the orange-trees in the garden below\r\nhis casement; and as suddenly, song answered song; the mate, awakened at\r\nthe note, gave back its happy answer to the bird. He listened; and not\r\nthe soul he had questioned, but the heart replied. He rose, and with\r\nrestless strides paced the narrow floor. “Away from this world!” he\r\nexclaimed at length, with an impatient tone. “Can no time loosen its\r\nfatal ties? As the attraction that holds the earth in space, is the\r\nattraction that fixes the soul to earth. Away from the dark grey planet!\r\nBreak, ye fetters: arise, ye wings!”\r\n\r\nHe passed through the silent galleries, and up the lofty stairs, and\r\nentered the secret chamber....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.V.\r\n\r\n     I and my fellows\r\n     Are ministers of Fate.\r\n     --“The Tempest.”\r\n\r\nThe next day Glyndon bent his steps towards Zanoni’s palace. The young\r\nman’s imagination, naturally inflammable, was singularly excited by the\r\nlittle he had seen and heard of this strange being,--a spell, he could\r\nneither master nor account for, attracted him towards the stranger.\r\nZanoni’s power seemed mysterious and great, his motives kindly and\r\nbenevolent, yet his manners chilling and repellent. Why at one moment\r\nreject Glyndon’s acquaintance, at another save him from danger? How\r\nhad Zanoni thus acquired the knowledge of enemies unknown to Glyndon\r\nhimself? His interest was deeply roused, his gratitude appealed to; he\r\nresolved to make another effort to conciliate the ungracious herbalist.\r\n\r\nThe signor was at home, and Glyndon was admitted into a lofty saloon,\r\nwhere in a few moments Zanoni joined him.\r\n\r\n“I am come to thank you for your warning last night,” said he, “and to\r\nentreat you to complete my obligation by informing me of the quarter to\r\nwhich I may look for enmity and peril.”\r\n\r\n“You are a gallant,” said Zanoni, with a smile, and in the English\r\nlanguage, “and do you know so little of the South as not to be aware\r\nthat gallants have always rivals?”\r\n\r\n“Are you serious?” said Glyndon, colouring.\r\n\r\n“Most serious. You love Viola Pisani; you have for rival one of the most\r\npowerful and relentless of the Neapolitan princes. Your danger is indeed\r\ngreat.”\r\n\r\n“But pardon me!--how came it known to you?”\r\n\r\n“I give no account of myself to mortal man,” replied Zanoni, haughtily;\r\n“and to me it matters nothing whether you regard or scorn my warning.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if I may not question you, be it so; but at least advise me what\r\nto do.”\r\n\r\n“Would you follow my advice?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because you are constitutionally brave; you are fond of excitement and\r\nmystery; you like to be the hero of a romance. Were I to advise you to\r\nleave Naples, would you do so while Naples contains a foe to confront or\r\na mistress to pursue?”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said the young Englishman, with energy. “No! and you\r\ncannot reproach me for such a resolution.”\r\n\r\n“But there is another course left to you: do you love Viola Pisani truly\r\nand fervently?--if so, marry her, and take a bride to your native land.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” answered Glyndon, embarrassed; “Viola is not of my rank. Her\r\nprofession, too, is--in short, I am enslaved by her beauty, but I cannot\r\nwed her.”\r\n\r\nZanoni frowned.\r\n\r\n“Your love, then, is but selfish lust, and I advise you to your own\r\nhappiness no more. Young man, Destiny is less inexorable than it\r\nappears. The resources of the great Ruler of the Universe are not so\r\nscanty and so stern as to deny to men the divine privilege of Free\r\nWill; all of us can carve out our own way, and God can make our very\r\ncontradictions harmonise with His solemn ends. You have before you\r\nan option. Honourable and generous love may even now work out your\r\nhappiness, and effect your escape; a frantic and selfish passion will\r\nbut lead you to misery and doom.”\r\n\r\n“Do you pretend, then, to read the future?”\r\n\r\n“I have said all that it pleases me to utter.”\r\n\r\n“While you assume the moralist to me, Signor Zanoni,” said Glyndon, with\r\na smile, “are you yourself so indifferent to youth and beauty as to act\r\nthe stoic to its allurements?”\r\n\r\n“If it were necessary that practice square with precept,” said Zanoni,\r\nwith a bitter smile, “our monitors would be but few. The conduct of the\r\nindividual can affect but a small circle beyond himself; the permanent\r\ngood or evil that he works to others lies rather in the sentiments he\r\ncan diffuse. His acts are limited and momentary; his sentiments may\r\npervade the universe, and inspire generations till the day of doom. All\r\nour virtues, all our laws, are drawn from books and maxims, which ARE\r\nsentiments, not from deeds. In conduct, Julian had the virtues of a\r\nChristian, and Constantine the vices of a Pagan. The sentiments of\r\nJulian reconverted thousands to Paganism; those of Constantine helped,\r\nunder Heaven’s will, to bow to Christianity the nations of the earth.\r\nIn conduct, the humblest fisherman on yonder sea, who believes in\r\nthe miracles of San Gennaro, may be a better man than Luther; to the\r\nsentiments of Luther the mind of modern Europe is indebted for the\r\nnoblest revolution it has known. Our opinions, young Englishman, are the\r\nangel part of us; our acts, the earthly.”\r\n\r\n“You have reflected deeply for an Italian,” said Glyndon.\r\n\r\n“Who told you that I was an Italian?”\r\n\r\n“Are you not? And yet, when I hear you speak my own language as a\r\nnative, I--”\r\n\r\n“Tush!” interrupted Zanoni, impatiently turning away. Then, after a\r\npause, he resumed in a mild voice, “Glyndon, do you renounce Viola\r\nPisani? Will you take some days to consider what I have said?”\r\n\r\n“Renounce her,--never!”\r\n\r\n“Then you will marry her?”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Be it so; she will then renounce you. I tell you that you have rivals.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the Prince di --; but I do not fear him.”\r\n\r\n“You have another whom you will fear more.”\r\n\r\n“And who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Myself.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon turned pale, and started from his seat.\r\n\r\n“You, Signor Zanoni!--you,--and you dare to tell me so?”\r\n\r\n“Dare! Alas! there are times when I wish that I could fear.”\r\n\r\nThese arrogant words were not uttered arrogantly, but in a tone of the\r\nmost mournful dejection. Glyndon was enraged, confounded, and yet\r\nawed. However, he had a brave English heart within his breast, and he\r\nrecovered himself quickly.\r\n\r\n“Signor,” said he, calmly, “I am not to be duped by these solemn phrases\r\nand these mystical assumptions. You may have powers which I cannot\r\ncomprehend or emulate, or you may be but a keen imposter.”\r\n\r\n“Well, proceed!”\r\n\r\n“I mean, then,” continued Glyndon, resolutely, though somewhat\r\ndisconcerted,--“I mean you to understand, that, though I am not to be\r\npersuaded or compelled by a stranger to marry Viola Pisani, I am not the\r\nless determined never tamely to yield her to another.”\r\n\r\nZanoni looked gravely at the young man, whose sparkling eyes and\r\nheightened colour testified the spirit to support his words, and\r\nreplied, “So bold! well; it becomes you. But take my advice; wait yet\r\nnine days, and tell me then if you will marry the fairest and the purest\r\ncreature that ever crossed your path.”\r\n\r\n“But if you love her, why--why--”\r\n\r\n“Why am I anxious that she should wed another?--to save her from myself!\r\nListen to me. That girl, humble and uneducated though she be, has in her\r\nthe seeds of the most lofty qualities and virtues. She can be all to the\r\nman she loves,--all that man can desire in wife. Her soul, developed by\r\naffection, will elevate your own; it will influence your fortunes, exalt\r\nyour destiny; you will become a great and a prosperous man. If, on the\r\ncontrary, she fall to me, I know not what may be her lot; but I know\r\nthat there is an ordeal which few can pass, and which hitherto no woman\r\nhas survived.”\r\n\r\nAs Zanoni spoke, his face became colourless, and there was something in\r\nhis voice that froze the warm blood of the listener.\r\n\r\n“What is this mystery which surrounds you?” exclaimed Glyndon, unable to\r\nrepress his emotion. “Are you, in truth, different from other men? Have\r\nyou passed the boundary of lawful knowledge? Are you, as some declare, a\r\nsorcerer, or only a--”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” interrupted Zanoni, gently, and with a smile of singular\r\nbut melancholy sweetness; “have you earned the right to ask me these\r\nquestions? Though Italy still boast an Inquisition, its power is\r\nrivelled as a leaf which the first wind shall scatter. The days of\r\ntorture and persecution are over; and a man may live as he pleases, and\r\ntalk as it suits him, without fear of the stake and the rack. Since I\r\ncan defy persecution, pardon me if I do not yield to curiosity.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon blushed, and rose. In spite of his love for Viola, and his\r\nnatural terror of such a rival, he felt himself irresistibly drawn\r\ntowards the very man he had most cause to suspect and dread. He held\r\nout his hand to Zanoni, saying, “Well, then, if we are to be rivals, our\r\nswords must settle our rights; till then I would fain be friends.”\r\n\r\n“Friends! You know not what you ask.”\r\n\r\n“Enigmas again!”\r\n\r\n“Enigmas!” cried Zanoni, passionately; “ay! can you dare to solve them?\r\nNot till then could I give you my right hand, and call you friend.”\r\n\r\n“I could dare everything and all things for the attainment of superhuman\r\nwisdom,” said Glyndon, and his countenance was lighted up with wild and\r\nintense enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nZanoni observed him in thoughtful silence.\r\n\r\n“The seeds of the ancestor live in the son,” he muttered; “he\r\nmay--yet--” He broke off abruptly; then, speaking aloud, “Go, Glyndon,”\r\n said he; “we shall meet again, but I will not ask your answer till the\r\nhour presses for decision.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.VI.\r\n\r\n     ‘Tis certain that this man has an estate of fifty thousand\r\n     livres, and seems to be a person of very great accomplishments.\r\n     But, then, if he’s a wizard, are wizards so devoutly given as\r\n     this man seems to be?  In short, I could make neither head nor\r\n     tail on’t\r\n\r\n     --The Count de Gabalis, Translation affixed to the\r\n     second edition of the “Rape of the Lock.”\r\n\r\nOf all the weaknesses which little men rail against, there is none that\r\nthey are more apt to ridicule than the tendency to believe. And of\r\nall the signs of a corrupt heart and a feeble head, the tendency of\r\nincredulity is the surest.\r\n\r\nReal philosophy seeks rather to solve than to deny. While we hear, every\r\nday, the small pretenders to science talk of the absurdities of alchemy\r\nand the dream of the Philosopher’s Stone, a more erudite knowledge is\r\naware that by alchemists the greatest discoveries in science have been\r\nmade, and much which still seems abstruse, had we the key to the mystic\r\nphraseology they were compelled to adopt, might open the way to yet\r\nmore noble acquisitions. The Philosopher’s Stone itself has seemed no\r\nvisionary chimera to some of the soundest chemists that even the present\r\ncentury has produced. (Mr. Disraeli, in his “Curiosities of Literature”\r\n (article “Alchem”), after quoting the sanguine judgments of modern\r\nchemists as to the transmutation of metals, observes of one yet greater\r\nand more recent than those to which Glyndon’s thoughts could have\r\nreferred, “Sir Humphry Davy told me that he did not consider this\r\nundiscovered art as impossible; but should it ever be discovered, it\r\nwould certainly be useless.”) Man cannot contradict the Laws of Nature.\r\nBut are all the laws of Nature yet discovered?\r\n\r\n“Give me a proof of your art,” says the rational inquirer. “When I have\r\nseen the effect, I will endeavour, with you, to ascertain the causes.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat to the above effect were the first thoughts of Clarence Glyndon\r\non quitting Zanoni. But Clarence Glyndon was no “rational inquirer.” The\r\nmore vague and mysterious the language of Zanoni, the more it imposed\r\nupon him. A proof would have been something tangible, with which he\r\nwould have sought to grapple. And it would have only disappointed his\r\ncuriosity to find the supernatural reduced to Nature. He endeavoured in\r\nvain, at some moments rousing himself from credulity to the scepticism\r\nhe deprecated, to reconcile what he had heard with the probable motives\r\nand designs of an imposter. Unlike Mesmer and Cagliostro, Zanoni,\r\nwhatever his pretensions, did not make them a source of profit; nor was\r\nGlyndon’s position or rank in life sufficient to render any influence\r\nobtained over his mind, subservient to schemes, whether of avarice or\r\nambition. Yet, ever and anon, with the suspicion of worldly knowledge,\r\nhe strove to persuade himself that Zanoni had at least some sinister\r\nobject in inducing him to what his English pride and manner of thought\r\nconsidered a derogatory marriage with the poor actress. Might not Viola\r\nand the Mystic be in league with each other? Might not all this jargon\r\nof prophecy and menace be but artifices to dupe him?\r\n\r\nHe felt an unjust resentment towards Viola at having secured such an\r\nally. But with that resentment was mingled a natural jealousy. Zanoni\r\nthreatened him with rivalry. Zanoni, who, whatever his character or his\r\narts, possessed at least all the external attributes that dazzle and\r\ncommand. Impatient of his own doubts, he plunged into the society of\r\nsuch acquaintances as he had made at Naples--chiefly artists, like\r\nhimself, men of letters, and the rich commercialists, who were already\r\nvying with the splendour, though debarred from the privileges, of the\r\nnobles. From these he heard much of Zanoni, already with them, as with\r\nthe idler classes, an object of curiosity and speculation.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed, as a thing remarkable, that Zanoni had conversed with\r\nhim in English, and with a command of the language so complete that he\r\nmight have passed for a native. On the other hand, in Italian, Zanoni\r\nwas equally at ease. Glyndon found that it was the same in languages\r\nless usually learned by foreigners. A painter from Sweden, who had\r\nconversed with him, was positive that he was a Swede; and a merchant\r\nfrom Constantinople, who had sold some of his goods to Zanoni, professed\r\nhis conviction that none but a Turk, or at least a native of the East,\r\ncould have so thoroughly mastered the soft Oriental intonations. Yet\r\nin all these languages, when they came to compare their several\r\nrecollections, there was a slight, scarce perceptible distinction, not\r\nin pronunciation, nor even accent, but in the key and chime, as it were,\r\nof the voice, between himself and a native. This faculty was one which\r\nGlyndon called to mind, that sect, whose tenets and powers have never\r\nbeen more than most partially explored, the Rosicrucians, especially\r\narrogated. He remembered to have heard in Germany of the work of John\r\nBringeret (Printed in 1615.), asserting that all the languages of the\r\nearth were known to the genuine Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross. Did\r\nZanoni belong to this mystical Fraternity, who, in an earlier age,\r\nboasted of secrets of which the Philosopher’s Stone was but the least;\r\nwho considered themselves the heirs of all that the Chaldeans, the Magi,\r\nthe Gymnosophists, and the Platonists had taught; and who differed from\r\nall the darker Sons of Magic in the virtue of their lives, the purity of\r\ntheir doctrines, and their insisting, as the foundation of all wisdom,\r\non the subjugation of the senses, and the intensity of Religious\r\nFaith?--a glorious sect, if they lied not! And, in truth, if Zanoni\r\nhad powers beyond the race of worldly sages, they seemed not unworthily\r\nexercised. The little known of his life was in his favour. Some acts,\r\nnot of indiscriminate, but judicious generosity and beneficence, were\r\nrecorded; in repeating which, still, however, the narrators shook their\r\nheads, and expressed surprise how a stranger should have possessed so\r\nminute a knowledge of the quiet and obscure distresses he had relieved.\r\nTwo or three sick persons, when abandoned by their physicians, he had\r\nvisited, and conferred with alone. They had recovered: they ascribed to\r\nhim their recovery; yet they could not tell by what medicines they had\r\nbeen healed. They could only depose that he came, conversed with them,\r\nand they were cured; it usually, however, happened that a deep sleep had\r\npreceded the recovery.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance was also beginning to be remarked, and spoke yet\r\nmore in his commendation. Those with whom he principally associated--the\r\ngay, the dissipated, the thoughtless, the sinners and publicans of the\r\nmore polished world--all appeared rapidly, yet insensibly to themselves,\r\nto awaken to purer thoughts and more regulated lives. Even Cetoxa, the\r\nprince of gallants, duellists, and gamesters, was no longer the same man\r\nsince the night of the singular events which he had related to\r\nGlyndon. The first trace of his reform was in his retirement from the\r\ngaming-houses; the next was his reconciliation with an hereditary enemy\r\nof his house, whom it had been his constant object for the last six\r\nyears to entangle in such a quarrel as might call forth his inimitable\r\nmanoeuvre of the stoccata. Nor when Cetoxa and his young companions were\r\nheard to speak of Zanoni, did it seem that this change had been brought\r\nabout by any sober lectures or admonitions. They all described Zanoni as\r\na man keenly alive to enjoyment: of manners the reverse of formal,--not\r\nprecisely gay, but equable, serene, and cheerful; ever ready to listen\r\nto the talk of others, however idle, or to charm all ears with an\r\ninexhaustible fund of brilliant anecdote and worldly experience. All\r\nmanners, all nations, all grades of men, seemed familiar to him. He was\r\nreserved only if allusion were ever ventured to his birth or history.\r\n\r\nThe more general opinion of his origin certainly seemed the more\r\nplausible. His riches, his familiarity with the languages of the East,\r\nhis residence in India, a certain gravity which never deserted his most\r\ncheerful and familiar hours, the lustrous darkness of his eyes and hair,\r\nand even the peculiarities of his shape, in the delicate smallness of\r\nthe hands, and the Arab-like turn of the stately head, appeared to fix\r\nhim as belonging to one at least of the Oriental races. And a dabbler\r\nin the Eastern tongues even sought to reduce the simple name of Zanoni,\r\nwhich a century before had been borne by an inoffensive naturalist of\r\nBologna (The author of two works on botany and rare plants.), to the\r\nradicals of the extinct language. Zan was unquestionably the Chaldean\r\nappellation for the sun. Even the Greeks, who mutilated every Oriental\r\nname, had retained the right one in this case, as the Cretan inscription\r\non the tomb of Zeus (Ode megas keitai Zan.--“Cyril contra Julian.” (Here\r\nlies great Jove.)) significantly showed. As to the rest, the Zan, or\r\nZaun, was, with the Sidonians, no uncommon prefix to On. Adonis was but\r\nanother name for Zanonas, whose worship in Sidon Hesychius records. To\r\nthis profound and unanswerable derivation Mervale listened with great\r\nattention, and observed that he now ventured to announce an erudite\r\ndiscovery he himself had long since made,--namely, that the numerous\r\nfamily of Smiths in England were undoubtedly the ancient priests of the\r\nPhrygian Apollo. “For,” said he, “was not Apollo’s surname, in\r\nPhrygia, Smintheus? How clear all the ensuing corruptions of the august\r\nname,--Smintheus, Smitheus, Smithe, Smith! And even now, I may remark\r\nthat the more ancient branches of that illustrious family, unconsciously\r\nanxious to approximate at least by a letter nearer to the true title,\r\ntake a pious pleasure in writing their names Smith_e_!”\r\n\r\nThe philologist was much struck with this discovery, and begged\r\nMervale’s permission to note it down as an illustration suitable to a\r\nwork he was about to publish on the origin of languages, to be called\r\n“Babel,” and published in three quartos by subscription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.VII.\r\n\r\n     Learn to be poor in spirit, my son, if you would penetrate that\r\n     sacred night which environs truth.

That night Viola did not perform at the theatre; and the next\r\nday, still disturbed by bewildered fancies, and averse to the sober and\r\nsarcastic companionship of Mervale, Glyndon sauntered musingly into the\r\npublic gardens, and paused under the very tree under which he had\r\nfirst heard the voice that had exercised upon his mind so singular an\r\ninfluence. The gardens were deserted. He threw himself on one of the\r\nseats placed beneath the shade; and again, in the midst of his reverie,\r\nthe same cold shudder came over him which Zanoni had so distinctly\r\ndefined, and to which he had ascribed so extraordinary a cause.\r\n\r\nHe roused himself with a sudden effort, and started to see, seated next\r\nhim, a figure hideous enough to have personated one of the malignant\r\nbeings of whom Zanoni had spoken. It was a small man, dressed in a\r\nfashion strikingly at variance with the elaborate costume of the day:\r\nan affectation of homeliness and poverty approaching to squalor, in\r\nthe loose trousers, coarse as a ship’s sail; in the rough jacket, which\r\nappeared rent wilfully into holes; and the black, ragged, tangled locks\r\nthat streamed from their confinement under a woollen cap, accorded but\r\nill with other details which spoke of comparative wealth. The shirt,\r\nopen at the throat, was fastened by a brooch of gaudy stones; and two\r\npendent massive gold chains announced the foppery of two watches.\r\n\r\nThe man’s figure, if not absolutely deformed, was yet marvellously\r\nill-favoured; his shoulders high and square; his chest flattened, as if\r\ncrushed in; his gloveless hands were knotted at the joints, and, large,\r\nbony, and muscular, dangled from lean, emaciated wrists, as if not\r\nbelonging to them. His features had the painful distortion sometimes\r\nseen in the countenance of a cripple,--large, exaggerated, with the nose\r\nnearly touching the chin; the eyes small, but glowing with a cunning\r\nfire as they dwelt on Glyndon; and the mouth was twisted into a grin\r\nthat displayed rows of jagged, black, broken teeth. Yet over this\r\nfrightful face there still played a kind of disagreeable intelligence,\r\nan expression at once astute and bold; and as Glyndon, recovering from\r\nthe first impression, looked again at his neighbour, he blushed at his\r\nown dismay, and recognised a French artist, with whom he had formed an\r\nacquaintance, and who was possessed of no inconsiderable talents in his\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was to be remarked that this creature, whose externals were\r\nso deserted by the Graces, particularly delighted in designs aspiring to\r\nmajesty and grandeur. Though his colouring was hard and shallow, as\r\nwas that generally of the French school at the time, his DRAWINGS were\r\nadmirable for symmetry, simple elegance, and classic vigour; at the same\r\ntime they unquestionably wanted ideal grace. He was fond of selecting\r\nsubjects from Roman history, rather than from the copious world of\r\nGrecian beauty, or those still more sublime stories of scriptural record\r\nfrom which Raphael and Michael Angelo borrowed their inspirations. His\r\ngrandeur was that not of gods and saints, but mortals. His delineation\r\nof beauty was that which the eye cannot blame and the soul does\r\nnot acknowledge. In a word, as it was said of Dionysius, he was an\r\nAnthropographos, or Painter of Men. It was also a notable contradiction\r\nin this person, who was addicted to the most extravagant excesses in\r\nevery passion, whether of hate or love, implacable in revenge, and\r\ninsatiable in debauch, that he was in the habit of uttering the most\r\nbeautiful sentiments of exalted purity and genial philanthropy. The\r\nworld was not good enough for him; he was, to use the expressive German\r\nphrase, A WORLD-BETTERER! Nevertheless, his sarcastic lip often seemed\r\nto mock the sentiments he uttered, as if it sought to insinuate that he\r\nwas above even the world he would construct.\r\n\r\nFinally, this painter was in close correspondence with the Republicans\r\nof Paris, and was held to be one of those missionaries whom, from the\r\nearliest period of the Revolution, the regenerators of mankind were\r\npleased to despatch to the various states yet shackled, whether by\r\nactual tyranny or wholesome laws. Certainly, as the historian of Italy\r\n(Botta.) has observed, there was no city in Italy where these new\r\ndoctrines would be received with greater favour than Naples, partly from\r\nthe lively temper of the people, principally because the most hateful\r\nfeudal privileges, however partially curtailed some years before by the\r\ngreat minister, Tanuccini, still presented so many daily and practical\r\nevils as to make change wear a more substantial charm than the mere and\r\nmeretricious bloom on the cheek of the harlot, Novelty. This man, whom\r\nI will call Jean Nicot, was, therefore, an oracle among the younger and\r\nbolder spirits of Naples; and before Glyndon had met Zanoni, the former\r\nhad not been among the least dazzled by the eloquent aspirations of the\r\nhideous philanthropist.\r\n\r\n“It is so long since we have met, cher confrere,” said Nicot, drawing\r\nhis seat nearer to Glyndon’s, “that you cannot be surprised that I\r\nsee you with delight, and even take the liberty to intrude on your\r\nmeditations.\r\n\r\n“They were of no agreeable nature,” said Glyndon; “and never was\r\nintrusion more welcome.”\r\n\r\n“You will be charmed to hear,” said Nicot, drawing several letters\r\nfrom his bosom, “that the good work proceeds with marvellous rapidity.\r\nMirabeau, indeed, is no more; but, mort Diable! the French people are\r\nnow a Mirabeau themselves.” With this remark, Monsieur Nicot proceeded\r\nto read and to comment upon several animated and interesting passages in\r\nhis correspondence, in which the word virtue was introduced twenty-seven\r\ntimes, and God not once. And then, warmed by the cheering prospects thus\r\nopened to him, he began to indulge in those anticipations of the future,\r\nthe outline of which we have already seen in the eloquent extravagance\r\nof Condorcet. All the old virtues were dethroned for a new Pantheon:\r\npatriotism was a narrow sentiment; philanthropy was to be its successor.\r\nNo love that did not embrace all mankind, as warm for Indus and the\r\nPole as for the hearth of home, was worthy the breast of a generous\r\nman. Opinion was to be free as air; and in order to make it so, it was\r\nnecessary to exterminate all those whose opinions were not the same as\r\nMons. Jean Nicot’s. Much of this amused, much revolted Glyndon; but when\r\nthe painter turned to dwell upon a science that all should comprehend,\r\nand the results of which all should enjoy,--a science that, springing\r\nfrom the soil of equal institutions and equal mental cultivation, should\r\ngive to all the races of men wealth without labour, and a life longer\r\nthan the Patriarchs’, without care,--then Glyndon listened with interest\r\nand admiration, not unmixed with awe. “Observe,” said Nicot, “how much\r\nthat we now cherish as a virtue will then be rejected as meanness. Our\r\noppressors, for instance, preach to us of the excellence of gratitude.\r\nGratitude, the confession of inferiority! What so hateful to a noble\r\nspirit as the humiliating sense of obligation? But where there is\r\nequality there can be no means for power thus to enslave merit. The\r\nbenefactor and the client will alike cease, and--”\r\n\r\n“And in the mean time,” said a low voice, at hand,--“in the mean time,\r\nJean Nicot?”\r\n\r\nThe two artists started, and Glyndon recognised Zanoni.\r\n\r\nHe gazed with a brow of unusual sternness on Nicot, who, lumped together\r\nas he sat, looked up at him askew, and with an expression of fear and\r\ndismay upon his distorted countenance.\r\n\r\nHo, ho! Messire Jean Nicot, thou who fearest neither God nor Devil, why\r\nfearest thou the eye of a man?\r\n\r\n“It is not the first time I have been a witness to your opinions on the\r\ninfirmity of gratitude,” said Zanoni.\r\n\r\nNicot suppressed an exclamation, and, after gloomily surveying Zanoni\r\nwith an eye villanous and sinister, but full of hate impotent and\r\nunutterable, said, “I know you not,--what would you of me?”\r\n\r\n“Your absence. Leave us!”\r\n\r\nNicot sprang forward a step, with hands clenched, and showing his teeth\r\nfrom ear to ear, like a wild beast incensed. Zanoni stood motionless,\r\nand smiled at him in scorn. Nicot halted abruptly, as if fixed and\r\nfascinated by the look, shivered from head to foot, and sullenly, and\r\nwith a visible effort, as if impelled by a power not his own, turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nGlyndon’s eyes followed him in surprise.\r\n\r\n“And what know you of this man?” said Zanoni.\r\n\r\n“I know him as one like myself,--a follower of art.”\r\n\r\n“Of ART! Do not so profane that glorious word. What Nature is to God,\r\nart should be to man,--a sublime, beneficent, genial, and warm creation.\r\nThat wretch may be a PAINTER, not an ARTIST.”\r\n\r\n“And pardon me if I ask what YOU know of one you thus disparage?”\r\n\r\n“I know thus much, that you are beneath my care if it be necessary to\r\nwarn you against him; his own lips show the hideousness of his heart.\r\nWhy should I tell you of the crimes he has committed? He SPEAKS crime!”\r\n\r\n“You do not seem, Signor Zanoni, to be one of the admirers of the\r\ndawning Revolution. Perhaps you are prejudiced against the man because\r\nyou dislike the opinions?”\r\n\r\n“What opinions?”\r\n\r\nGlyndon paused, somewhat puzzled to define; but at length he said, “Nay,\r\nI must wrong you; for you, of all men, I suppose, cannot discredit the\r\ndoctrine that preaches the infinite improvement of the human species.”\r\n\r\n“You are right; the few in every age improve the many; the many now may\r\nbe as wise as the few were; but improvement is at a standstill, if you\r\ntell me that the many now are as wise as the few ARE.”\r\n\r\n“I comprehend you; you will not allow the law of universal equality!”\r\n\r\n“Law! If the whole world conspired to enforce the falsehood they could\r\nnot make it LAW. Level all conditions to-day, and you only smooth away\r\nall obstacles to tyranny to-morrow. A nation that aspires to EQUALITY\r\nis unfit for FREEDOM. Throughout all creation, from the archangel to the\r\nworm, from Olympus to the pebble, from the radiant and completed planet\r\nto the nebula that hardens through ages of mist and slime into the\r\nhabitable world, the first law of Nature is inequality.”\r\n\r\n“Harsh doctrine, if applied to states. Are the cruel disparities of life\r\nnever to be removed?”\r\n\r\n“Disparities of the PHYSICAL life? Oh, let us hope so. But disparities\r\nof the INTELLECTUAL and the MORAL, never! Universal equality of\r\nintelligence, of mind, of genius, of virtue!--no teacher left to the\r\nworld! no men wiser, better than others,--were it not an impossible\r\ncondition, WHAT A HOPELESS PROSPECT FOR HUMANITY! No, while the world\r\nlasts, the sun will gild the mountain-top before it shines upon the\r\nplain. Diffuse all the knowledge the earth contains equally over all\r\nmankind to-day, and some men will be wiser than the rest to-morrow. And\r\nTHIS is not a harsh, but a loving law,--the REAL law of improvement;\r\nthe wiser the few in one generation, the wiser will be the multitude the\r\nnext!”\r\n\r\nAs Zanoni thus spoke, they moved on through the smiling gardens, and the\r\nbeautiful bay lay sparkling in the noontide. A gentle breeze just cooled\r\nthe sunbeam, and stirred the ocean; and in the inexpressible clearness\r\nof the atmosphere there was something that rejoiced the senses. The very\r\nsoul seemed to grow lighter and purer in that lucid air.\r\n\r\n“And these men, to commence their era of improvement and equality, are\r\njealous even of the Creator. They would deny an intelligence,--a God!”\r\n said Zanoni, as if involuntarily. “Are you an artist, and, looking on\r\nthe world, can you listen to such a dogma? Between God and genius there\r\nis a necessary link,--there is almost a correspondent language. Well\r\nsaid the Pythagorean (Sextus, the Pythagorean.), ‘A good intellect is\r\nthe chorus of divinity.’”\r\n\r\nStruck and touched with these sentiments, which he little expected to\r\nfall from one to whom he ascribed those powers which the superstitions\r\nof childhood ascribe to the darker agencies, Glyndon said: “And yet you\r\nhave confessed that your life, separated from that of others, is one\r\nthat man should dread to share. Is there, then, a connection between\r\nmagic and religion?”\r\n\r\n“Magic!” And what is magic! When the traveller beholds in Persia the\r\nruins of palaces and temples, the ignorant inhabitants inform him they\r\nwere the work of magicians. What is beyond their own power, the vulgar\r\ncannot comprehend to be lawfully in the power of others. But if by\r\nmagic you mean a perpetual research amongst all that is more latent and\r\nobscure in Nature, I answer, I profess that magic, and that he who does\r\nso comes but nearer to the fountain of all belief. Knowest thou not that\r\nmagic was taught in the schools of old? But how, and by whom? As the\r\nlast and most solemn lesson, by the Priests who ministered to the\r\nTemple. (Psellus de Daemon (MS.)) And you, who would be a painter, is\r\nnot there a magic also in that art you would advance? Must you not,\r\nafter long study of the Beautiful that has been, seize upon new and airy\r\ncombinations of a beauty that is to be? See you not that the grander\r\nart, whether of poet or of painter, ever seeking for the TRUE, abhors\r\nthe REAL; that you must seize Nature as her master, not lackey her as\r\nher slave?\r\n\r\n“You demand mastery over the past, a conception of the future. Has not\r\nthe art that is truly noble for its domain the future and the past? You\r\nwould conjure the invisible beings to your charm; and what is painting\r\nbut the fixing into substance the Invisible? Are you discontented with\r\nthis world? This world was never meant for genius! To exist, it must\r\ncreate another. What magician can do more; nay, what science can do\r\nas much? There are two avenues from the little passions and the drear\r\ncalamities of earth; both lead to heaven and away from hell,--art and\r\nscience. But art is more godlike than science; science discovers, art\r\ncreates. You have faculties that may command art; be contented with your\r\nlot. The astronomer who catalogues the stars cannot add one atom to the\r\nuniverse; the poet can call a universe from the atom; the chemist may\r\nheal with his drugs the infirmities of the human form; the painter,\r\nor the sculptor, fixes into everlasting youth forms divine, which\r\nno disease can ravage, and no years impair. Renounce those wandering\r\nfancies that lead you now to myself, and now to yon orator of the human\r\nrace; to us two, who are the antipodes of each other! Your pencil is\r\nyour wand; your canvas may raise Utopias fairer than Condorcet dreams\r\nof. I press not yet for your decision; but what man of genius ever asked\r\nmore to cheer his path to the grave than love and glory?”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Glyndon, fixing his eyes earnestly on Zanoni, “if there be a\r\npower to baffle the grave itself--”\r\n\r\nZanoni’s brow darkened. “And were this so,” he said, after a pause,\r\n“would it be so sweet a lot to outlive all you loved, and to recoil from\r\nevery human tie? Perhaps the fairest immortality on earth is that of a\r\nnoble name.”\r\n\r\n“You do not answer me,--you equivocate. I have read of the long lives\r\nfar beyond the date common experience assigns to man,” persisted\r\nGlyndon, “which some of the alchemists enjoyed. Is the golden elixir but\r\na fable?”\r\n\r\n“If not, and these men discovered it, they died, because they refused to\r\nlive! There may be a mournful warning in your conjecture. Turn once more\r\nto the easel and the canvas!”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Zanoni waved his hand, and, with downcast eyes and a slow\r\nstep, bent his way back into the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.VIII.\r\n\r\n     The Goddess Wisdom.\r\n\r\n     To some she is the goddess great;\r\n     To some the milch cow of the field;\r\n     Their care is but to calculate\r\n     What butter she will yield.\r\n     From Schiller.\r\n\r\nThis last conversation with Zanoni left upon the mind of Glyndon a\r\ntranquillising and salutary effect.\r\n\r\nFrom the confused mists of his fancy glittered forth again those happy,\r\ngolden schemes which part from the young ambition of art, to play in the\r\nair, to illumine the space like rays that kindle from the sun. And with\r\nthese projects mingled also the vision of a love purer and serener than\r\nhis life yet had known. His mind went back into that fair childhood of\r\ngenius, when the forbidden fruit is not yet tasted, and we know of no\r\nland beyond the Eden which is gladdened by an Eve. Insensibly before\r\nhim there rose the scenes of a home, with his art sufficing for all\r\nexcitement, and Viola’s love circling occupation with happiness and\r\ncontent; and in the midst of these fantasies of a future that might\r\nbe at his command, he was recalled to the present by the clear, strong\r\nvoice of Mervale, the man of common-sense.\r\n\r\nWhoever has studied the lives of persons in whom the imagination is\r\nstronger than the will, who suspect their own knowledge of actual life,\r\nand are aware of their facility to impressions, will have observed the\r\ninfluence which a homely, vigorous, worldly understanding obtains over\r\nsuch natures. It was thus with Glyndon. His friend had often extricated\r\nhim from danger, and saved him from the consequences of imprudence; and\r\nthere was something in Mervale’s voice alone that damped his enthusiasm,\r\nand often made him yet more ashamed of noble impulses than weak conduct.\r\nFor Mervale, though a downright honest man, could not sympathise with\r\nthe extravagance of generosity any more than with that of presumption\r\nand credulity. He walked the straight line of life, and felt an equal\r\ncontempt for the man who wandered up the hill-sides, no matter whether\r\nto chase a butterfly, or to catch a prospect of the ocean.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you your thoughts, Clarence,” said Mervale, laughing,\r\n“though I am no Zanoni. I know them by the moisture of your eyes,\r\nand the half-smile on your lips. You are musing upon that fair\r\nperdition,--the little singer of San Carlo.”\r\n\r\nThe little singer of San Carlo! Glyndon coloured as he answered,--\r\n\r\n“Would you speak thus of her if she were my wife?”\r\n\r\n“No! for then any contempt I might venture to feel would be for\r\nyourself. One may dislike the duper, but it is the dupe that one\r\ndespises.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure that I should be the dupe in such a union? Where can I\r\nfind one so lovely and so innocent,--where one whose virtue has been\r\ntried by such temptation? Does even a single breath of slander sully the\r\nname of Viola Pisani?”\r\n\r\n“I know not all the gossip of Naples, and therefore cannot answer; but I\r\nknow this, that in England no one would believe that a young Englishman,\r\nof good fortune and respectable birth, who marries a singer from the\r\ntheatre of Naples, has not been lamentably taken in. I would save you\r\nfrom a fall of position so irretrievable. Think how many mortifications\r\nyou will be subjected to; how many young men will visit at your\r\nhouse,--and how many young wives will as carefully avoid it.”\r\n\r\n“I can choose my own career, to which commonplace society is not\r\nessential. I can owe the respect of the world to my art, and not to the\r\naccidents of birth and fortune.”\r\n\r\n“That is, you still persist in your second folly,--the absurd ambition\r\nof daubing canvas. Heaven forbid I should say anything against the\r\nlaudable industry of one who follows such a profession for the sake of\r\nsubsistence; but with means and connections that will raise you in life,\r\nwhy voluntarily sink into a mere artist? As an accomplishment in leisure\r\nmoments, it is all very well in its way; but as the occupation of\r\nexistence, it is a frenzy.”\r\n\r\n“Artists have been the friends of princes.”\r\n\r\n“Very rarely so, I fancy, in sober England. There in the great centre of\r\npolitical aristocracy, what men respect is the practical, not the ideal.\r\nJust suffer me to draw two pictures of my own. Clarence Glyndon returns\r\nto England; he marries a lady of fortune equal to his own, of friends\r\nand parentage that advance rational ambition. Clarence Glyndon, thus a\r\nwealthy and respectable man, of good talents, of bustling energies then\r\nconcentrated, enters into practical life. He has a house at which he can\r\nreceive those whose acquaintance is both advantage and honour; he has\r\nleisure which he can devote to useful studies; his reputation, built on\r\na solid base, grows in men’s mouths. He attaches himself to a party; he\r\nenters political life; and new connections serve to promote his objects.\r\nAt the age of five-and-forty, what, in all probability, may Clarence\r\nGlyndon be? Since you are ambitious I leave that question for you to\r\ndecide! Now turn to the other picture. Clarence Glyndon returns to\r\nEngland with a wife who can bring him no money, unless he lets her out\r\non the stage; so handsome, that every one asks who she is, and every one\r\nhears,--the celebrated singer, Pisani. Clarence Glyndon shuts himself\r\nup to grind colours and paint pictures in the grand historical school,\r\nwhich nobody buys. There is even a prejudice against him, as not having\r\nstudied in the Academy,--as being an amateur. Who is Mr. Clarence\r\nGlyndon? Oh, the celebrated Pisani’s husband! What else? Oh, he exhibits\r\nthose large pictures! Poor man! they have merit in their way; but\r\nTeniers and Watteau are more convenient, and almost as cheap. Clarence\r\nGlyndon, with an easy fortune while single, has a large family which his\r\nfortune, unaided by marriage, can just rear up to callings more plebeian\r\nthan his own. He retires into the country, to save and to paint; he\r\ngrows slovenly and discontented; ‘the world does not appreciate him,’\r\nhe says, and he runs away from the world. At the age of forty-five\r\nwhat will be Clarence Glyndon? Your ambition shall decide that question\r\nalso!”\r\n\r\n“If all men were as worldly as you,” said Glyndon, rising, “there would\r\nnever have been an artist or a poet!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we should do just as well without them,” answered Mervale. “Is\r\nit not time to think of dinner? The mullets here are remarkably fine!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.IX.\r\n\r\n     Wollt ihr hoch auf ihren Flugeln schweben,\r\n     Werft die Angst des Irdischen von euch!\r\n     Fliehet aus dem engen dumpfen Leben\r\n     In des Ideales Reich!\r\n     “Das Ideal und das Leben.”\r\n\r\n     Wouldst thou soar heavenward on its joyous wing?\r\n     Cast off the earthly burden of the Real;\r\n     High from this cramped and dungeoned being, spring\r\n     Into the realm of the Ideal.\r\n\r\nAs some injudicious master lowers and vitiates the taste of the student\r\nby fixing his attention to what he falsely calls the Natural, but which,\r\nin reality, is the Commonplace, and understands not that beauty in\r\nart is created by what Raphael so well describes,--namely, THE IDEA OF\r\nBEAUTY IN THE PAINTER’S OWN MIND; and that in every art, whether its\r\nplastic expression be found in words or marble, colours or sounds, the\r\nservile imitation of Nature is the work of journeymen and tyros,--so in\r\nconduct the man of the world vitiates and lowers the bold enthusiasm of\r\nloftier natures by the perpetual reduction of whatever is generous and\r\ntrustful to all that is trite and coarse. A great German poet has well\r\ndefined the distinction between discretion and the larger wisdom. In the\r\nlast there is a certain rashness which the first disdains,--\r\n\r\n“The purblind see but the receding shore, Not that to which the bold\r\nwave wafts them o’er.”\r\n\r\nYet in this logic of the prudent and the worldly there is often a\r\nreasoning unanswerable of its kind.\r\n\r\nYou must have a feeling,--a faith in whatever is self-sacrificing\r\nand divine, whether in religion or in art, in glory or in love; or\r\nCommon-sense will reason you out of the sacrifice, and a syllogism will\r\ndebase the Divine to an article in the market.\r\n\r\nEvery true critic in art, from Aristotle and Pliny, from Winkelman and\r\nVasari to Reynolds and Fuseli, has sought to instruct the painter that\r\nNature is not to be copied, but EXALTED; that the loftiest order of art,\r\nselecting only the loftiest combinations, is the perpetual struggle of\r\nHumanity to approach the gods. The great painter, as the great author,\r\nembodies what is POSSIBLE to MAN, it is true, but what is not COMMON\r\nto MANKIND. There is truth in Hamlet; in Macbeth, and his witches; in\r\nDesdemona; in Othello; in Prospero, and in Caliban; there is truth in\r\nthe cartoons of Raphael; there is truth in the Apollo, the Antinous,\r\nand the Laocoon. But you do not meet the originals of the words, the\r\ncartoons, or the marble, in Oxford Street or St. James’s. All these, to\r\nreturn to Raphael, are the creatures of the idea in the artist’s mind.\r\nThis idea is not inborn, it has come from an intense study. But that\r\nstudy has been of the ideal that can be raised from the positive and\r\nthe actual into grandeur and beauty. The commonest model becomes full of\r\nexquisite suggestions to him who has formed this idea; a Venus of flesh\r\nand blood would be vulgarised by the imitation of him who has not.\r\n\r\nWhen asked where he got his models, Guido summoned a common porter from\r\nhis calling, and drew from a mean original a head of surpassing beauty.\r\nIt resembled the porter, but idealised the porter to the hero. It was\r\ntrue, but it was not real. There are critics who will tell you that the\r\nBoor of Teniers is more true to Nature than the Porter of Guido! The\r\ncommonplace public scarcely understand the idealising principle, even in\r\nart; for high art is an acquired taste.\r\n\r\nBut to come to my comparison. Still less is the kindred principle\r\ncomprehended in conduct. And the advice of worldly prudence would as\r\noften deter from the risks of virtue as from the punishments of vice;\r\nyet in conduct, as in art, there is an idea of the great and beautiful,\r\nby which men should exalt the hackneyed and the trite of life. Now\r\nGlyndon felt the sober prudence of Mervale’s reasonings; he recoiled\r\nfrom the probable picture placed before him, in his devotion to the one\r\nmaster-talent he possessed, and the one master-passion that, rightly\r\ndirected, might purify his whole being as a strong wind purifies the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nBut though he could not bring himself to decide in the teeth of so\r\nrational a judgment, neither could he resolve at once to abandon the\r\npursuit of Viola. Fearful of being influenced by Zanoni’s counsels and\r\nhis own heart, he had for the last two days shunned an interview with\r\nthe young actress. But after a night following his last conversation\r\nwith Zanoni, and that we have just recorded with Mervale,--a night\r\ncoloured by dreams so distinct as to seem prophetic, dreams that\r\nappeared so to shape his future according to the hints of Zanoni that he\r\ncould have fancied Zanoni himself had sent them from the house of sleep\r\nto haunt his pillow,--he resolved once more to seek Viola; and though\r\nwithout a definite or distinct object, he yielded himself up to the\r\nimpulse of his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.X.\r\n\r\n     O sollecito dubbio e fredda tema\r\n     Che pensando l’accresci.\r\n     Tasso, Canzone vi.\r\n\r\n     (O anxious doubt and chilling fear that grows by thinking.)\r\n\r\nShe was seated outside her door,--the young actress! The sea before her\r\nin that heavenly bay seemed literally to sleep in the arms of the shore;\r\nwhile, to the right, not far off, rose the dark and tangled crags to\r\nwhich the traveller of to-day is duly brought to gaze on the tomb of\r\nVirgil, or compare with the cavern of Posilipo the archway of Highgate\r\nHill. There were a few fisherman loitering by the cliffs, on which their\r\nnets were hung to dry; and at a distance the sound of some rustic pipe\r\n(more common at that day than at this), mingled now and then with the\r\nbells of the lazy mules, broke the voluptuous silence,--the silence of\r\ndeclining noon on the shores of Naples; never, till you have enjoyed it,\r\nnever, till you have felt its enervating but delicious charm, believe\r\nthat you can comprehend all the meaning of the Dolce far niente (The\r\npleasure of doing nothing.); and when that luxury has been known, when\r\nyou have breathed that atmosphere of fairy-land, then you will no longer\r\nwonder why the heart ripens into fruit so sudden and so rich beneath the\r\nrosy skies and the glorious sunshine of the South.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the actress were fixed on the broad blue deep beyond. In the\r\nunwonted negligence of her dress might be traced the abstraction of her\r\nmind. Her beautiful hair was gathered up loosely, and partially bandaged\r\nby a kerchief whose purple colour served to deepen the golden hue of her\r\ntresses. A stray curl escaped and fell down the graceful neck. A loose\r\nmorning-robe, girded by a sash, left the breeze. That came ever and anon\r\nfrom the sea, to die upon the bust half disclosed; and the tiny slipper,\r\nthat Cinderella might have worn, seemed a world too wide for the tiny\r\nfoot which it scarcely covered. It might be the heat of the day that\r\ndeepened the soft bloom of the cheeks, and gave an unwonted languor to\r\nthe large, dark eyes. In all the pomp of her stage attire,--in all the\r\nflush of excitement before the intoxicating lamps,--never had Viola\r\nlooked so lovely.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the actress, and filling up the threshold,--stood\r\nGionetta, with her arms thrust to the elbow in two huge pockets on\r\neither side of her gown.\r\n\r\n“But I assure you,” said the nurse, in that sharp, quick, ear-splitting\r\ntone in which the old women of the South are more than a match for those\r\nof the North,--“but I assure you, my darling, that there is not a finer\r\ncavalier in all Naples, nor a more beautiful, than this Inglese; and I\r\nam told that all these Inglesi are much richer than they seem. Though\r\nthey have no trees in their country, poor people! and instead of\r\ntwenty-four they have only twelve hours to the day, yet I hear that they\r\nshoe their horses with scudi; and since they cannot (the poor heretics!)\r\nturn grapes into wine, for they have no grapes, they turn gold into\r\nphysic, and take a glass or two of pistoles whenever they are troubled\r\nwith the colic. But you don’t hear me, little pupil of my eyes,--you\r\ndon’t hear me!”\r\n\r\n“And these things are whispered of Zanoni!” said Viola, half to herself,\r\nand unheeding Gionetta’s eulogies on Glyndon and the English.\r\n\r\n“Blessed Maria! do not talk of this terrible Zanoni. You may be sure\r\nthat his beautiful face, like his yet more beautiful pistoles, is\r\nonly witchcraft. I look at the money he gave me the other night, every\r\nquarter of an hour, to see whether it has not turned into pebbles.”\r\n\r\n“Do you then really believe,” said Viola, with timid earnestness, “that\r\nsorcery still exists?”\r\n\r\n“Believe! Do I believe in the blessed San Gennaro? How do you think he\r\ncured old Filippo the fisherman, when the doctor gave him up? How do you\r\nthink he has managed himself to live at least these three hundred years?\r\nHow do you think he fascinates every one to his bidding with a look, as\r\nthe vampires do?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, is this only witchcraft? It is like it,--it must be!” murmured\r\nViola, turning very pale. Gionetta herself was scarcely more\r\nsuperstitious than the daughter of the musician. And her very innocence,\r\nchilled at the strangeness of virgin passion, might well ascribe to\r\nmagic what hearts more experienced would have resolved to love.\r\n\r\n“And then, why has this great Prince di -- been so terrified by him? Why\r\nhas he ceased to persecute us? Why has he been so quiet and still? Is\r\nthere no sorcery in all that?”\r\n\r\n“Think you, then,” said Viola, with sweet inconsistency, “that I owe\r\nthat happiness and safety to his protection? Oh, let me so believe! Be\r\nsilent, Gionetta! Why have I only thee and my own terrors to consult?\r\nO beautiful sun!” and the girl pressed her hand to her heart with wild\r\nenergy; “thou lightest every spot but this. Go, Gionetta! leave me\r\nalone,--leave me!”\r\n\r\n“And indeed it is time I should leave you; for the polenta will be\r\nspoiled, and you have eat nothing all day. If you don’t eat you will\r\nlose your beauty, my darling, and then nobody will care for you. Nobody\r\ncares for us when we grow ugly,--I know that; and then you must, like\r\nold Gionetta, get some Viola of your own to spoil. I’ll go and see to\r\nthe polenta.”\r\n\r\n“Since I have known this man,” said the girl, half aloud,--“since his\r\ndark eyes have haunted me, I am no longer the same. I long to escape\r\nfrom myself,--to glide with the sunbeam over the hill-tops; to become\r\nsomething that is not of earth. Phantoms float before me at night; and\r\na fluttering, like the wing of a bird, within my heart, seems as if the\r\nspirit were terrified, and would break its cage.”\r\n\r\nWhile murmuring these incoherent rhapsodies, a step that she did not\r\nhear approached the actress, and a light hand touched her arm.\r\n\r\n“Viola!--bellissima!--Viola!”\r\n\r\nShe turned, and saw Glyndon. The sight of his fair young face calmed her\r\nat once. His presence gave her pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Viola,” said the Englishman, taking her hand, and drawing her again\r\nto the bench from which she had risen, as he seated himself beside her,\r\n“you shall hear me speak! You must know already that I love thee! It has\r\nnot been pity or admiration alone that has led me ever and ever to thy\r\ndear side; reasons there may have been why I have not spoken, save by\r\nmy eyes, before; but this day--I know not how it is--I feel a more\r\nsustained and settled courage to address thee, and learn the happiest or\r\nthe worst. I have rivals, I know,--rivals who are more powerful than the\r\npoor artist; are they also more favoured?”\r\n\r\nViola blushed faintly; but her countenance was grave and distressed.\r\nLooking down, and marking some hieroglyphical figures in the dust with\r\nthe point of her slipper, she said, with some hesitation, and a vain\r\nattempt to be gay, “Signor, whoever wastes his thoughts on an actress\r\nmust submit to have rivals. It is our unhappy destiny not to be sacred\r\neven to ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“But you do not love this destiny, glittering though it seem; your heart\r\nis not in the vocation which your gifts adorn.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no!” said the actress, her eyes filling with tears. “Once I loved\r\nto be the priestess of song and music; now I feel only that it is a\r\nmiserable lot to be slave to a multitude.”\r\n\r\n“Fly, then, with me,” said the artist, passionately; “quit forever the\r\ncalling that divides that heart I would have all my own. Share my fate\r\nnow and forever,--my pride, my delight, my ideal! Thou shalt inspire my\r\ncanvas and my song; thy beauty shall be made at once holy and renowned.\r\nIn the galleries of princes, crowds shall gather round the effigy of a\r\nVenus or a Saint, and a whisper shall break forth, ‘It is Viola Pisani!’\r\nAh! Viola, I adore thee; tell me that I do not worship in vain.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art good and fair,” said Viola, gazing on her lover, as he pressed\r\nnearer to her, and clasped her hand in his; “but what should I give thee\r\nin return?”\r\n\r\n“Love, love,--only love!”\r\n\r\n“A sister’s love?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, speak not with such cruel coldness!”\r\n\r\n“It is all I have for thee. Listen to me, signor: when I look on your\r\nface, when I hear your voice, a certain serene and tranquil calm creeps\r\nover and lulls thoughts,--oh, how feverish, how wild! When thou art\r\ngone, the day seems a shade more dark; but the shadow soon flies. I\r\nmiss thee not; I think not of thee: no, I love thee not; and I will give\r\nmyself only where I love.”\r\n\r\n“But I would teach thee to love me; fear it not. Nay, such love as\r\nthou describest, in our tranquil climates, is the love of innocence and\r\nyouth.”\r\n\r\n“Of innocence!” said Viola. “Is it so? Perhaps--” She paused, and added,\r\nwith an effort, “Foreigner! and wouldst thou wed the orphan? Ah, THOU at\r\nleast art generous! It is not the innocence thou wouldst destroy!”\r\n\r\nGlyndon drew back, conscience-stricken.\r\n\r\n“No, it may not be!” she said, rising, but not conscious of the\r\nthoughts, half of shame, half suspicion, that passed through the mind\r\nof her lover. “Leave me, and forget me. You do not understand, you\r\ncould not comprehend, the nature of her whom you think to love. From my\r\nchildhood upward, I have felt as if I were marked out for some strange\r\nand preternatural doom; as if I were singled from my kind. This feeling\r\n(and, oh! at times it is one of delirious and vague delight, at others\r\nof the darkest gloom) deepens within me day by day. It is like the\r\nshadow of twilight, spreading slowly and solemnly around. My hour\r\napproaches: a little while, and it will be night!”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Glyndon listened with visible emotion and perturbation.\r\n“Viola!” he exclaimed, as she ceased, “your words more than ever enchain\r\nme to you. As you feel, I feel. I, too, have been ever haunted with a\r\nchill and unearthly foreboding. Amidst the crowds of men I have felt\r\nalone. In all my pleasures, my toils, my pursuits, a warning voice has\r\nmurmured in my ear, ‘Time has a dark mystery in store for thy manhood.’\r\nWhen you spoke, it was as the voice of my own soul.”\r\n\r\nViola gazed upon him in wonder and fear. Her countenance was as white as\r\nmarble; and those features, so divine in their rare symmetry, might have\r\nserved the Greek with a study for the Pythoness, when, from the mystic\r\ncavern and the bubbling spring, she first hears the voice of the\r\ninspiring god. Gradually the rigour and tension of that wonderful face\r\nrelaxed, the colour returned, the pulse beat: the heart animated the\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” she said, turning partially aside,--“tell me, have you\r\nseen--do you know--a stranger in this city,--one of whom wild stories\r\nare afloat?”\r\n\r\n“You speak of Zanoni? I have seen him: I know him,--and you? Ah, he,\r\ntoo, would be my rival!--he, too, would bear thee from me!”\r\n\r\n“You err,” said Viola, hastily, and with a deep sigh; “he pleads for\r\nyou: he informed me of your love; he besought me not--not to reject it.”\r\n\r\n“Strange being! incomprehensible enigma! Why did you name him?”\r\n\r\n“Why! ah, I would have asked whether, when you first saw him, the\r\nforeboding, the instinct, of which you spoke, came on you more\r\nfearfully, more intelligibly than before; whether you felt at once\r\nrepelled from him, yet attracted towards him; whether you felt,” and the\r\nactress spoke with hurried animation, “that with HIM was connected the\r\nsecret of your life?”\r\n\r\n“All this I felt,” answered Glyndon, in a trembling voice, “the first\r\ntime I was in his presence. Though all around me was gay,--music,\r\namidst lamp-lit trees, light converse near, and heaven without a cloud\r\nabove,--my knees knocked together, my hair bristled, and my blood\r\ncurdled like ice. Since then he has divided my thoughts with thee.”\r\n\r\n“No more, no more!” said Viola, in a stifled tone; “there must be the\r\nhand of fate in this. I can speak to you no more now. Farewell!” She\r\nsprung past him into the house, and closed the door. Glyndon did not\r\nfollow her, nor, strange as it may seem, was he so inclined. The thought\r\nand recollection of that moonlit hour in the gardens, of the strange\r\naddress of Zanoni, froze up all human passion. Viola herself, if not\r\nforgotten, shrunk back like a shadow into the recesses of his breast.\r\nHe shivered as he stepped into the sunlight, and musingly retraced his\r\nsteps into the more populous parts of that liveliest of Italian cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III. -- THEURGIA.\r\n\r\n     --i cavalier sen vanno\r\n     dove il pino fatal gli attende in porto.\r\n     Gerus.

Von D--.\r\n\r\nAt this time it chanced that Viola had the opportunity to return the\r\nkindness shown to her by the friendly musician whose house had received\r\nand sheltered her when first left an orphan on the world. Old Bernardi\r\nhad brought up three sons to the same profession as himself, and they\r\nhad lately left Naples to seek their fortunes in the wealthier cities\r\nof Northern Europe, where the musical market was less overstocked. There\r\nwas only left to glad the household of his aged wife and himself, a\r\nlively, prattling, dark-eyed girl of some eight years old, the child\r\nof his second son, whose mother had died in giving her birth. It so\r\nhappened that, about a month previous to the date on which our story has\r\nnow entered, a paralytic affection had disabled Bernardi from the duties\r\nof his calling. He had been always a social, harmless, improvident,\r\ngenerous fellow--living on his gains from day to day, as if the day of\r\nsickness and old age never was to arrive. Though he received a small\r\nallowance for his past services, it ill sufficed for his wants,; neither\r\nwas he free from debt. Poverty stood at his hearth,--when Viola’s\r\ngrateful smile and liberal hand came to chase the grim fiend away. But\r\nit is not enough to a heart truly kind to send and give; more charitable\r\nis it to visit and console. “Forget not thy father’s friend.” So almost\r\ndaily went the bright idol of Naples to the house of Bernardi. Suddenly\r\na heavier affliction than either poverty or the palsy befell the old\r\nmusician. His grandchild, his little Beatrice, fell ill, suddenly and\r\ndangerously ill, of one of those rapid fevers common to the South; and\r\nViola was summoned from her strange and fearful reveries of love or\r\nfancy, to the sick-bed of the young sufferer.\r\n\r\nThe child was exceedingly fond of Viola, and the old people thought that\r\nher mere presence would bring healing; but when Viola arrived, Beatrice\r\nwas insensible. Fortunately there was no performance that evening at San\r\nCarlo, and she resolved to stay the night and partake its fearful cares\r\nand dangerous vigil.\r\n\r\nBut during the night the child grew worse, the physician (the leechcraft\r\nhas never been very skilful at Naples) shook his powdered head, kept his\r\naromatics at his nostrils, administered his palliatives, and departed.\r\nOld Bernardi seated himself by the bedside in stern silence; here was\r\nthe last tie that bound him to life. Well, let the anchor break and the\r\nbattered ship go down! It was an iron resolve, more fearful than sorrow.\r\nAn old man, with one foot in the grave, watching by the couch of a dying\r\nchild, is one of the most awful spectacles in human calamities. The wife\r\nwas more active, more bustling, more hopeful, and more tearful. Viola\r\ntook heed of all three. But towards dawn, Beatrice’s state became so\r\nobviously alarming, that Viola herself began to despair. At this time\r\nshe saw the old woman suddenly rise from before the image of the saint\r\nat which she had been kneeling, wrap herself in her cloak and hood, and\r\nquietly quit the chamber. Viola stole after her.\r\n\r\n“It is cold for thee, good mother, to brave the air; let me go for the\r\nphysician?”\r\n\r\n“Child, I am not going to him. I have heard of one in the city who has\r\nbeen tender to the poor, and who, they say, has cured the sick when\r\nphysicians failed. I will go and say to him, ‘Signor, we are beggars\r\nin all else, but yesterday we were rich in love. We are at the close\r\nof life, but we lived in our grandchild’s childhood. Give us back our\r\nwealth,--give us back our youth. Let us die blessing God that the thing\r\nwe love survives us.’”\r\n\r\nShe was gone. Why did thy heart beat, Viola? The infant’s sharp cry\r\nof pain called her back to the couch; and there still sat the old man,\r\nunconscious of his wife’s movements, not stirring, his eyes glazing fast\r\nas they watched the agonies of that slight frame. By degrees the wail\r\nof pain died into a low moan,--the convulsions grew feebler, but more\r\nfrequent; the glow of fever faded into the blue, pale tinge that settles\r\ninto the last bloodless marble.\r\n\r\nThe daylight came broader and clearer through the casement; steps were\r\nheard on the stairs,--the old woman entered hastily; she rushed to the\r\nbed, cast a glance on the patient, “She lives yet, signor, she lives!”\r\n\r\nViola raised her eyes,--the child’s head was pillowed on her bosom,--and\r\nshe beheld Zanoni. He smiled on her with a tender and soft approval,\r\nand took the infant from her arms. Yet even then, as she saw him bending\r\nsilently over that pale face, a superstitious fear mingled with her\r\nhopes. “Was it by lawful--by holy art that--” her self-questioning\r\nceased abruptly; for his dark eye turned to her as if he read her soul,\r\nand his aspect accused her conscience for its suspicion, for it spoke\r\nreproach not unmingled with disdain.\r\n\r\n“Be comforted,” he said, gently turning to the old man, “the danger is\r\nnot beyond the reach of human skill;” and, taking from his bosom a small\r\ncrystal vase, he mingled a few drops with water. No sooner did this\r\nmedicine moisten the infant’s lips, than it seemed to produce an\r\nastonishing effect. The colour revived rapidly on the lips and cheeks;\r\nin a few moments the sufferer slept calmly, and with the regular\r\nbreathing of painless sleep. And then the old man rose, rigidly, as a\r\ncorpse might rise,--looked down, listened, and creeping gently away,\r\nstole to the corner of the room, and wept, and thanked Heaven!\r\n\r\nNow, old Bernardi had been, hitherto, but a cold believer; sorrow had\r\nnever before led him aloft from earth. Old as he was, he had never\r\nbefore thought as the old should think of death,--that endangered life\r\nof the young had wakened up the careless soul of age. Zanoni whispered\r\nto the wife, and she drew the old man quietly from the room.\r\n\r\n“Dost thou fear to leave me an hour with thy charge, Viola? Thinkest\r\nthou still that this knowledge is of the Fiend?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Viola, humbled and yet rejoiced, “forgive me, forgive me,\r\nsignor. Thou biddest the young live and the old pray. My thoughts never\r\nshall wrong thee more!”\r\n\r\nBefore the sun rose, Beatrice was out of danger; at noon Zanoni escaped\r\nfrom the blessings of the aged pair, and as he closed the door of the\r\nhouse, he found Viola awaiting him without.\r\n\r\nShe stood before him timidly, her hands crossed meekly on her bosom, her\r\ndowncast eyes swimming with tears.\r\n\r\n“Do not let me be the only one you leave unhappy!”\r\n\r\n“And what cure can the herbs and anodynes effect for thee? If thou canst\r\nso readily believe ill of those who have aided and yet would serve thee,\r\nthy disease is of the heart; and--nay, weep not! nurse of the sick, and\r\ncomforter of the sad, I should rather approve than chide thee. Forgive\r\nthee! Life, that ever needs forgiveness, has, for its first duty, to\r\nforgive.”\r\n\r\n“No, do not forgive me yet. I do not deserve a pardon; for even now,\r\nwhile I feel how ungrateful I was to believe, suspect, aught injurious\r\nand false to my preserver, my tears flow from happiness, not remorse.\r\nOh!” she continued, with a simple fervour, unconscious, in her innocence\r\nand her generous emotions, of all the secrets she betrayed,--“thou\r\nknowest not how bitter it was to believe thee not more good, more pure,\r\nmore sacred than all the world. And when I saw thee,--the wealthy,\r\nthe noble, coming from thy palace to minister to the sufferings of\r\nthe hovel,--when I heard those blessings of the poor breathed upon thy\r\nparting footsteps, I felt my very self exalted,--good in thy goodness,\r\nnoble at least in those thoughts that did NOT wrong thee.”\r\n\r\n“And thinkest thou, Viola, that in a mere act of science there is so\r\nmuch virtue? The commonest leech will tend the sick for his fee. Are\r\nprayers and blessings a less reward than gold?”\r\n\r\n“And mine, then, are not worthless? Thou wilt accept of mine?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Viola!” exclaimed Zanoni, with a sudden passion, that covered her\r\nface with blushes, “thou only, methinks, on all the earth, hast the\r\npower to wound or delight me!” He checked himself, and his face became\r\ngrave and sad. “And this,” he added, in an altered tone, “because, if\r\nthou wouldst heed my counsels, methinks I could guide a guileless heart\r\nto a happy fate.”\r\n\r\n“Thy counsels! I will obey them all. Mould me to what thou wilt. In\r\nthine absence, I am as a child that fears every shadow in the dark; in\r\nthy presence, my soul expands, and the whole world seems calm with a\r\ncelestial noonday. Do not deny to me that presence. I am fatherless and\r\nignorant and alone!”\r\n\r\nZanoni averted his face, and, after a moment’s silence, replied\r\ncalmly,--\r\n\r\n“Be it so. Sister, I will visit thee again!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.II.\r\n\r\n     Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy.\r\n     Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nWho so happy as Viola now! A dark load was lifted from her heart: her\r\nstep seemed to tread on air; she would have sung for very delight as she\r\nwent gayly home. It is such happiness to the pure to love,--but oh, such\r\nmore than happiness to believe in the worth of the one beloved. Between\r\nthem there might be human obstacles,--wealth, rank, man’s little world.\r\nBut there was no longer that dark gulf which the imagination recoils to\r\ndwell on, and which separates forever soul from soul. He did not love\r\nher in return. Love her! But did she ask for love? Did she herself love?\r\nNo; or she would never have been at once so humble and so bold. How\r\nmerrily the ocean murmured in her ear; how radiant an aspect the\r\ncommonest passer-by seemed to wear! She gained her home,--she looked\r\nupon the tree, glancing, with fantastic branches, in the sun. “Yes,\r\nbrother mine!” she said, laughing in her joy, “like thee, I HAVE\r\nstruggled to the light!”\r\n\r\nShe had never hitherto, like the more instructed Daughters of the North,\r\naccustomed herself to that delicious Confessional, the transfusion of\r\nthought to writing. Now, suddenly, her heart felt an impulse; a new-born\r\ninstinct, that bade it commune with itself, bade it disentangle its web\r\nof golden fancies,--made her wish to look upon her inmost self as in\r\na glass. Upsprung from the embrace of Love and Soul--the Eros and the\r\nPsyche--their beautiful offspring, Genius! She blushed, she sighed, she\r\ntrembled as she wrote. And from the fresh world that she had built for\r\nherself, she was awakened to prepare for the glittering stage. How dull\r\nbecame the music, how dim the scene, so exquisite and so bright of old.\r\nStage, thou art the Fairy Land to the vision of the worldly. Fancy,\r\nwhose music is not heard by men, whose scenes shift not by mortal hand,\r\nas the stage to the present world, art thou to the future and the past!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.III.\r\n\r\n     In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes.\r\n     Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at noon, Zanoni visited Viola; and the next day and the\r\nnext and again the next,--days that to her seemed like a special time\r\nset apart from the rest of life. And yet he never spoke to her in the\r\nlanguage of flattery, and almost of adoration, to which she had been\r\naccustomed. Perhaps his very coldness, so gentle as it was, assisted to\r\nthis mysterious charm. He talked to her much of her past life, and she\r\nwas scarcely surprised (she now never thought of TERROR) to perceive how\r\nmuch of that past seemed known to him.\r\n\r\nHe made her speak to him of her father; he made her recall some of the\r\nairs of Pisani’s wild music. And those airs seemed to charm and lull him\r\ninto reverie.\r\n\r\n“As music was to the musician,” said he, “may science be to the wise.\r\nYour father looked abroad in the world; all was discord to the fine\r\nsympathies that he felt with the harmonies that daily and nightly float\r\nto the throne of Heaven. Life, with its noisy ambition and its mean\r\npassions, is so poor and base! Out of his soul he created the life and\r\nthe world for which his soul was fitted. Viola, thou art the daughter of\r\nthat life, and wilt be the denizen of that world.”\r\n\r\nIn his earlier visits he did not speak of Glyndon. The day soon came on\r\nwhich he renewed the subject. And so trustful, obedient, and entire was\r\nthe allegiance that Viola now owned to his dominion, that, unwelcome\r\nas that subject was, she restrained her heart, and listened to him in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAt last he said, “Thou hast promised thou wilt obey my counsels, and if,\r\nViola, I should ask thee, nay adjure, to accept this stranger’s hand,\r\nand share his fate, should he offer to thee such a lot,--wouldst thou\r\nrefuse?”\r\n\r\nAnd then she pressed back the tears that gushed to her eyes; and with\r\na strange pleasure in the midst of pain,--the pleasure of one who\r\nsacrifices heart itself to the one who commands that heart,--she\r\nanswered falteringly, “If thou CANST ordain it, why--”\r\n\r\n“Speak on.”\r\n\r\n“Dispose of me as thou wilt!”\r\n\r\nZanoni stood in silence for some moments: he saw the struggle which\r\nthe girl thought she concealed so well; he made an involuntary movement\r\ntowards her, and pressed her hand to his lips; it was the first time\r\nhe had ever departed even so far from a certain austerity which perhaps\r\nmade her fear him and her own thoughts the less.\r\n\r\n“Viola,” said he, and his voice trembled, “the danger that I can avert\r\nno more, if thou linger still in Naples, comes hourly near and near to\r\nthee! On the third day from this thy fate must be decided. I accept thy\r\npromise. Before the last hour of that day, come what may, I shall see\r\nthee again, HERE, at thine own house. Till then, farewell!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.IV.\r\n\r\n     Between two worlds life hovers like a star\r\n     ‘Twixt night and morn.\r\n     --Byron.\r\n\r\nWhen Glyndon left Viola, as recorded in the concluding chapter of the\r\nsecond division of this work, he was absorbed again in those mystical\r\ndesires and conjectures which the haunting recollection of Zanoni\r\nalways served to create. And as he wandered through the streets, he\r\nwas scarcely conscious of his own movements till, in the mechanism of\r\ncustom, he found himself in the midst of one of the noble collections of\r\npictures which form the boast of those Italian cities whose glory is\r\nin the past. Thither he had been wont, almost daily, to repair, for the\r\ngallery contained some of the finest specimens of a master especially\r\nthe object of his enthusiasm and study. There, before the works of\r\nSalvator, he had often paused in deep and earnest reverence. The\r\nstriking characteristic of that artist is the “Vigour of Will;” void\r\nof the elevated idea of abstract beauty, which furnishes a model and\r\narchetype to the genius of more illustrious order, the singular energy\r\nof the man hews out of the rock a dignity of his own. His images have\r\nthe majesty, not of the god, but the savage; utterly free, like the\r\nsublimer schools, from the common-place of imitation,--apart, with\r\nthem, from the conventional littleness of the Real,--he grasps the\r\nimagination, and compels it to follow him, not to the heaven, but\r\nthrough all that is most wild and fantastic upon earth; a sorcery, not\r\nof the starry magian, but of the gloomy wizard,--a man of romance whose\r\nheart beat strongly, griping art with a hand of iron, and forcing it\r\nto idealise the scenes of his actual life. Before this powerful will,\r\nGlyndon drew back more awed and admiring than before the calmer beauty\r\nwhich rose from the soul of Raphael, like Venus from the deep.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as awaking from his reverie, he stood opposite to that wild and\r\nmagnificent gloom of Nature which frowned on him from the canvas,\r\nthe very leaves on those gnome-like, distorted trees seemed to rustle\r\nsibylline secrets in his ear. Those rugged and sombre Apennines, the\r\ncataract that dashed between, suited, more than the actual scenes would\r\nhave done, the mood and temper of his mind. The stern, uncouth forms\r\nat rest on the crags below, and dwarfed by the giant size of the Matter\r\nthat reigned around them, impressed him with the might of Nature and the\r\nlittleness of Man. As in genius of the more spiritual cast, the living\r\nman, and the soul that lives in him, are studiously made the prominent\r\nimage; and the mere accessories of scene kept down, and cast back, as if\r\nto show that the exile from paradise is yet the monarch of the outward\r\nworld,--so, in the landscapes of Salvator, the tree, the mountain,\r\nthe waterfall, become the principal, and man himself dwindles to the\r\naccessory. The Matter seems to reign supreme, and its true lord to\r\ncreep beneath its stupendous shadow. Inert matter giving interest to\r\nthe immortal man, not the immortal man to the inert matter. A terrible\r\nphilosophy in art!\r\n\r\nWhile something of these thoughts passed through the mind of the\r\npainter, he felt his arm touched, and saw Nicot by his side.\r\n\r\n“A great master,” said Nicot, “but I do not love the school.”\r\n\r\n“I do not love, but I am awed by it. We love the beautiful and serene,\r\nbut we have a feeling as deep as love for the terrible and dark.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Nicot, thoughtfully. “And yet that feeling is only a\r\nsuperstition. The nursery, with its tales of ghosts and goblins, is the\r\ncradle of many of our impressions in the world. But art should not seek\r\nto pander to our ignorance; art should represent only truths. I confess\r\nthat Raphael pleases me less, because I have no sympathy with his\r\nsubjects. His saints and virgins are to me only men and women.”\r\n\r\n“And from what source should painting, then, take its themes?”\r\n\r\n“From history, without doubt,” returned Nicot, pragmatically,--“those\r\ngreat Roman actions which inspire men with sentiments of liberty and\r\nvalour, with the virtues of a republic. I wish the cartoons of Raphael\r\nhad illustrated the story of the Horatii; but it remains for France and\r\nher Republic to give to posterity the new and the true school, which\r\ncould never have arisen in a country of priestcraft and delusion.”\r\n\r\n“And the saints and virgins of Raphael are to you only men and women?”\r\n repeated Glyndon, going back to Nicot’s candid confession in amaze, and\r\nscarcely hearing the deductions the Frenchman drew from his proposition.\r\n\r\n“Assuredly. Ha, ha!” and Nicot laughed hideously, “do you ask me to\r\nbelieve in the calendar, or what?”\r\n\r\n“But the ideal?”\r\n\r\n“The ideal!” interrupted Nicot. “Stuff! The Italian critics, and your\r\nEnglish Reynolds, have turned your head. They are so fond of\r\ntheir ‘gusto grande,’ and their ‘ideal beauty that speaks to the\r\nsoul!’--soul!--IS there a soul? I understand a man when he talks of\r\ncomposing for a refined taste,--for an educated and intelligent reason;\r\nfor a sense that comprehends truths. But as for the soul,--bah!--we\r\nare but modifications of matter, and painting is modification of matter\r\nalso.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon turned his eyes from the picture before him to Nicot, and from\r\nNicot to the picture. The dogmatist gave a voice to the thoughts which\r\nthe sight of the picture had awakened. He shook his head without reply.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” said Nicot, abruptly, “that imposter,--Zanoni!--oh! I have\r\nnow learned his name and quackeries, forsooth,--what did he say to thee\r\nof me?”\r\n\r\n“Of thee? Nothing; but to warn me against thy doctrines.”\r\n\r\n“Aha! was that all?” said Nicot. “He is a notable inventor, and since,\r\nwhen we met last, I unmasked his delusions, I thought he might retaliate\r\nby some tale of slander.”\r\n\r\n“Unmasked his delusions!--how?”\r\n\r\n“A dull and long story: he wished to teach an old doting friend of mine\r\nhis secrets of prolonged life and philosophical alchemy. I advise thee\r\nto renounce so discreditable an acquaintance.”\r\n\r\nWith that Nicot nodded significantly, and, not wishing to be further\r\nquestioned, went his way.\r\n\r\nGlyndon’s mind at that moment had escaped to his art, and the comments\r\nand presence of Nicot had been no welcome interruption. He turned\r\nfrom the landscape of Salvator, and his eye falling on a Nativity by\r\nCoreggio, the contrast between the two ranks of genius struck him as\r\na discovery. That exquisite repose, that perfect sense of beauty, that\r\nstrength without effort, that breathing moral of high art, which speaks\r\nto the mind through the eye, and raises the thoughts, by the aid of\r\ntenderness and love, to the regions of awe and wonder,--ay! THAT was the\r\ntrue school. He quitted the gallery with reluctant steps and inspired\r\nideas; he sought his own home. Here, pleased not to find the sober\r\nMervale, he leaned his face on his hands, and endeavoured to recall the\r\nwords of Zanoni in their last meeting. Yes, he felt Nicot’s talk even on\r\nart was crime; it debased the imagination itself to mechanism. Could\r\nhe, who saw nothing in the soul but a combination of matter, prate of\r\nschools that should excel a Raphael? Yes, art was magic; and as he owned\r\nthe truth of the aphorism, he could comprehend that in magic there may\r\nbe religion, for religion is an essential to art. His old ambition,\r\nfreeing itself from the frigid prudence with which Mervale sought to\r\ndesecrate all images less substantial than the golden calf of the world,\r\nrevived, and stirred, and kindled. The subtle detection of what he\r\nconceived to be an error in the school he had hitherto adopted, made\r\nmore manifest to him by the grinning commentary of Nicot, seemed to open\r\nto him a new world of invention. He seized the happy moment,--he placed\r\nbefore him the colours and the canvas. Lost in his conceptions of a\r\nfresh ideal, his mind was lifted aloft into the airy realms of beauty;\r\ndark thoughts, unhallowed desires, vanished. Zanoni was right: the\r\nmaterial world shrunk from his gaze; he viewed Nature as from a\r\nmountain-top afar; and as the waves of his unquiet heart became calm and\r\nstill, again the angel eyes of Viola beamed on them as a holy star.\r\n\r\nLocking himself in his chamber, he refused even the visits of Mervale.\r\nIntoxicated with the pure air of his fresh existence, he remained for\r\nthree days, and almost nights, absorbed in his employment; but on the\r\nfourth morning came that reaction to which all labour is exposed. He\r\nwoke listless and fatigued; and as he cast his eyes on the canvas, the\r\nglory seemed to have gone from it. Humiliating recollections of the\r\ngreat masters he aspired to rival forced themselves upon him; defects\r\nbefore unseen magnified themselves to deformities in his languid and\r\ndiscontented eyes. He touched and retouched, but his hand failed him; he\r\nthrew down his instruments in despair; he opened his casement: the day\r\nwithout was bright and lovely; the street was crowded with that life\r\nwhich is ever so joyous and affluent in the animated population of\r\nNaples. He saw the lover, as he passed, conversing with his mistress by\r\nthose mute gestures which have survived all changes of languages, the\r\nsame now as when the Etruscan painted yon vases in the Museo Borbonico.\r\nLight from without beckoned his youth to its mirth and its pleasures;\r\nand the dull walls within, lately large enough to comprise heaven and\r\nearth, seemed now cabined and confined as a felon’s prison. He welcomed\r\nthe step of Mervale at his threshold, and unbarred the door.\r\n\r\n“And is that all you have done?” said Mervale, glancing disdainfully\r\nat the canvas. “Is it for this that you have shut yourself out from the\r\nsunny days and moonlit nights of Naples?”\r\n\r\n“While the fit was on me, I basked in a brighter sun, and imbibed the\r\nvoluptuous luxury of a softer moon.”\r\n\r\n“You own that the fit is over. Well, that is some sign of returning\r\nsense. After all, it is better to daub canvas for three days than make a\r\nfool of yourself for life. This little siren?”\r\n\r\n“Be dumb! I hate to hear you name her.”\r\n\r\nMervale drew his chair nearer to Glyndon’s, thrust his hands deep in his\r\nbreeches-pockets, stretched his legs, and was about to begin a serious\r\nstrain of expostulation, when a knock was heard at the door, and Nicot,\r\nwithout waiting for leave, obtruded his ugly head.\r\n\r\n“Good-day, mon cher confrere. I wished to speak to you. Hein! you have\r\nbeen at work, I see. This is well,--very well! A bold outline,--great\r\nfreedom in that right hand. But, hold! is the composition good? You have\r\nnot got the great pyramidal form. Don’t you think, too, that you have\r\nlost the advantage of contrast in this figure; since the right leg is\r\nput forward, surely the right arm should be put back? Peste! but that\r\nlittle finger is very fine!”\r\n\r\nMervale detested Nicot. For all speculators, Utopians, alterers of the\r\nworld, and wanderers from the high road, were equally hateful to\r\nhim; but he could have hugged the Frenchman at that moment. He saw\r\nin Glyndon’s expressive countenance all the weariness and disgust he\r\nendured. After so wrapped a study, to be prated to about pyramidal\r\nforms and right arms and right legs, the accidence of the art, the whole\r\nconception to be overlooked, and the criticism to end in approval of the\r\nlittle finger!\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Glyndon, peevishly, throwing the cloth over his design,\r\n“enough of my poor performance. What is it you have to say to me?”\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” said Nicot, huddling himself together upon\r\na stool,--“in the first place, this Signor Zanoni,--this second\r\nCagliostro,--who disputes my doctrines! (no doubt a spy of the man\r\nCapet) I am not vindictive; as Helvetius says, ‘our errors arise from\r\nour passions.’ I keep mine in order; but it is virtuous to hate in the\r\ncause of mankind; I would I had the denouncing and the judging of Signor\r\nZanoni at Paris.” And Nicot’s small eyes shot fire, and he gnashed his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n“Have you any new cause to hate him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Nicot, fiercely. “Yes, I hear he is courting the girl I mean\r\nto marry.”\r\n\r\n“You! Whom do you speak of?”\r\n\r\n“The celebrated Pisani! She is divinely handsome. She would make my\r\nfortune in a republic. And a republic we shall have before the year is\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nMervale rubbed his hands, and chuckled. Glyndon coloured with rage and\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n“Do you know the Signora Pisani? Have you ever spoken to her?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. But when I make up my mind to anything, it is soon done. I\r\nam about to return to Paris. They write me word that a handsome wife\r\nadvances the career of a patriot. The age of prejudice is over.\r\nThe sublimer virtues begin to be understood. I shall take back the\r\nhandsomest wife in Europe.”\r\n\r\n“Be quiet! What are you about?” said Mervale, seizing Glyndon as he saw\r\nhim advance towards the Frenchman, his eyes sparkling, and his hands\r\nclenched.\r\n\r\n“Sir!” said Glyndon, between his teeth, “you know not of whom you thus\r\nspeak. Do you affect to suppose that Viola Pisani would accept YOU?”\r\n\r\n“Not if she could get a better offer,” said Mervale, looking up to the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n“A better offer? You don’t understand me,” said Nicot. “I, Jean Nicot,\r\npropose to marry the girl; marry her! Others may make her more liberal\r\noffers, but no one, I apprehend, would make one so honourable. I alone\r\nhave pity on her friendless situation. Besides, according to the dawning\r\nstate of things, one will always, in France, be able to get rid of a\r\nwife whenever one wishes. We shall have new laws of divorce. Do you\r\nimagine that an Italian girl--and in no country in the world are\r\nmaidens, it seems, more chaste (though wives may console themselves with\r\nvirtues more philosophical)--would refuse the hand of an artist for the\r\nsettlements of a prince? No; I think better of the Pisani than you do. I\r\nshall hasten to introduce myself to her.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you all success, Monsieur Nicot,” said Mervale, rising, and\r\nshaking him heartily by the hand.\r\n\r\nGlyndon cast at them both a disdainful glance.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, Monsieur Nicot,” said he, at length, constraining his lips\r\ninto a bitter smile,--“perhaps you may have rivals.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better,” replied Monsieur Nicot, carelessly, kicking his\r\nheels together, and appearing absorbed in admiration at the size of his\r\nlarge feet.\r\n\r\n“I myself admire Viola Pisani.”\r\n\r\n“Every painter must!”\r\n\r\n“I may offer her marriage as well as yourself.”\r\n\r\n“That would be folly in you, though wisdom in me. You would not know\r\nhow to draw profit from the speculation! Cher confrere, you have\r\nprejudices.”\r\n\r\n“You do not dare to say you would make profit from your own wife?”\r\n\r\n“The virtuous Cato lent his wife to a friend. I love virtue, and I\r\ncannot do better than imitate Cato. But to be serious,--I do not\r\nfear you as a rival. You are good-looking, and I am ugly. But you are\r\nirresolute, and I decisive. While you are uttering fine phrases, I shall\r\nsay, simply, ‘I have a bon etat. Will you marry me?’ So do your worst,\r\ncher confrere. Au revoir, behind the scenes!”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Nicot rose, stretched his long arms and short legs, yawned\r\ntill he showed all his ragged teeth from ear to ear, pressed down his\r\ncap on his shaggy head with an air of defiance, and casting over his\r\nleft shoulder a glance of triumph and malice at the indignant Glyndon,\r\nsauntered out of the room.\r\n\r\nMervale burst into a violent fit of laughter. “See how your Viola is\r\nestimated by your friend. A fine victory, to carry her off from the\r\nugliest dog between Lapland and the Calmucks.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon was yet too indignant to answer, when a new visitor arrived. It\r\nwas Zanoni himself. Mervale, on whom the appearance and aspect of this\r\npersonage imposed a kind of reluctant deference, which he was unwilling\r\nto acknowledge, and still more to betray, nodded to Glyndon, and saying,\r\nsimply, “More when I see you again,” left the painter and his unexpected\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Zanoni, lifting the cloth from the canvas, “that you have\r\nnot slighted the advice I gave you. Courage, young artist; this is an\r\nescape from the schools: this is full of the bold self-confidence of\r\nreal genius. You had no Nicot--no Mervale--at your elbow when this image\r\nof true beauty was conceived!”\r\n\r\nCharmed back to his art by this unlooked-for praise, Glyndon replied\r\nmodestly, “I thought well of my design till this morning; and then I was\r\ndisenchanted of my happy persuasion.”\r\n\r\n“Say, rather, that, unaccustomed to continuous labour, you were fatigued\r\nwith your employment.”\r\n\r\n“That is true. Shall I confess it? I began to miss the world without. It\r\nseemed to me as if, while I lavished my heart and my youth upon visions\r\nof beauty, I was losing the beautiful realities of actual life. And I\r\nenvied the merry fisherman, singing as he passed below my casement, and\r\nthe lover conversing with his mistress.”\r\n\r\n“And,” said Zanoni, with an encouraging smile, “do you blame yourself\r\nfor the natural and necessary return to earth, in which even the most\r\nhabitual visitor of the Heavens of Invention seeks his relaxation and\r\nrepose? Man’s genius is a bird that cannot be always on the wing; when\r\nthe craving for the actual world is felt, it is a hunger that must be\r\nappeased. They who command best the ideal, enjoy ever most the real.\r\nSee the true artist, when abroad in men’s thoroughfares, ever observant,\r\never diving into the heart, ever alive to the least as to the greatest\r\nof the complicated truths of existence; descending to what pedants would\r\ncall the trivial and the frivolous. From every mesh in the social web,\r\nhe can disentangle a grace. And for him each airy gossamer floats in\r\nthe gold of the sunlight. Know you not that around the animalcule that\r\nsports in the water there shines a halo, as around the star (The monas\r\nmica, found in the purest pools, is encompassed with a halo. And this\r\nis frequent amongst many other species of animalcule.) that revolves in\r\nbright pastime through the space? True art finds beauty everywhere. In\r\nthe street, in the market-place, in the hovel, it gathers food for the\r\nhive of its thoughts. In the mire of politics, Dante and Milton selected\r\npearls for the wreath of song.\r\n\r\n“Who ever told you that Raphael did not enjoy the life without, carrying\r\neverywhere with him the one inward idea of beauty which attracted and\r\nimbedded in its own amber every straw that the feet of the dull man\r\ntrampled into mud? As some lord of the forest wanders abroad for its\r\nprey, and scents and follows it over plain and hill, through brake and\r\njungle, but, seizing it at last, bears the quarry to its unwitnessed\r\ncave,--so Genius searches through wood and waste, untiringly and\r\neagerly, every sense awake, every nerve strained to speed and strength,\r\nfor the scattered and flying images of matter, that it seizes at\r\nlast with its mighty talons, and bears away with it into solitudes\r\nno footstep can invade. Go, seek the world without; it is for art the\r\ninexhaustible pasture-ground and harvest to the world within!”\r\n\r\n“You comfort me,” said Glyndon, brightening. “I had imagined my\r\nweariness a proof of my deficiency! But not now would I speak to you\r\nof these labours. Pardon me, if I pass from the toil to the reward.\r\nYou have uttered dim prophecies of my future, if I wed one who, in\r\nthe judgment of the sober world, would only darken its prospects and\r\nobstruct its ambition. Do you speak from the wisdom which is experience,\r\nor that which aspires to prediction?”\r\n\r\n“Are they not allied? Is it not he best accustomed to calculation who\r\ncan solve at a glance any new problem in the arithmetic of chances?”\r\n\r\n“You evade my question.”\r\n\r\n“No; but I will adapt my answer the better to your comprehension, for\r\nit is upon this very point that I have sought you. Listen to me!”\r\n Zanoni fixed his eyes earnestly on his listener, and continued: “For the\r\naccomplishment of whatever is great and lofty, the clear perception of\r\ntruths is the first requisite,--truths adapted to the object desired.\r\nThe warrior thus reduces the chances of battle to combinations almost\r\nof mathematics. He can predict a result, if he can but depend upon\r\nthe materials he is forced to employ. At such a loss he can cross that\r\nbridge; in such a time he can reduce that fort. Still more accurately,\r\nfor he depends less on material causes than ideas at his command, can\r\nthe commander of the purer science or diviner art, if he once perceive\r\nthe truths that are in him and around, foretell what he can achieve,\r\nand in what he is condemned to fail. But this perception of truths is\r\ndisturbed by many causes,--vanity, passion, fear, indolence in himself,\r\nignorance of the fitting means without to accomplish what he designs. He\r\nmay miscalculate his own forces; he may have no chart of the country\r\nhe would invade. It is only in a peculiar state of the mind that it is\r\ncapable of perceiving truth; and that state is profound serenity. Your\r\nmind is fevered by a desire for truth: you would compel it to your\r\nembraces; you would ask me to impart to you, without ordeal or\r\npreparation, the grandest secrets that exist in Nature. But truth can no\r\nmore be seen by the mind unprepared for it, than the sun can dawn upon\r\nthe midst of night. Such a mind receives truth only to pollute it: to\r\nuse the simile of one who has wandered near to the secret of the sublime\r\nGoetia (or the magic that lies within Nature, as electricity within the\r\ncloud), ‘He who pours water into the muddy well, does but disturb the\r\nmud.’” (“Iamb. de Vit. Pythag.”)\r\n\r\n“What do you tend to?”\r\n\r\n“This: that you have faculties that may attain to surpassing power, that\r\nmay rank you among those enchanters who, greater than the magian,\r\nleave behind them an enduring influence, worshipped wherever beauty is\r\ncomprehended, wherever the soul is sensible of a higher world than that\r\nin which matter struggles for crude and incomplete existence.\r\n\r\n“But to make available those faculties, need I be a prophet to tell you\r\nthat you must learn to concentre upon great objects all your desires?\r\nThe heart must rest, that the mind may be active. At present you wander\r\nfrom aim to aim. As the ballast to the ship, so to the spirit are faith\r\nand love. With your whole heart, affections, humanity, centred in one\r\nobject, your mind and aspirations will become equally steadfast and in\r\nearnest. Viola is a child as yet; you do not perceive the high nature\r\nthe trials of life will develop. Pardon me, if I say that her soul,\r\npurer and loftier than your own, will bear it upward, as a secret hymn\r\ncarries aloft the spirits of the world. Your nature wants the harmony,\r\nthe music which, as the Pythagoreans wisely taught, at once elevates and\r\nsoothes. I offer you that music in her love.”\r\n\r\n“But am I sure that she does love me?”\r\n\r\n“Artist, no; she loves you not at present; her affections are full of\r\nanother. But if I could transfer to you, as the loadstone transfers its\r\nattraction to the magnet, the love that she has now for me,--if I could\r\ncause her to see in you the ideal of her dreams--”\r\n\r\n“Is such a gift in the power of man?”\r\n\r\n“I offer it to you, if your love be lawful, if your faith in virtue and\r\nyourself be deep and loyal; if not, think you that I would disenchant\r\nher with truth to make her adore a falsehood?”\r\n\r\n“But if,” persisted Glyndon,--“if she be all that you tell me, and if\r\nshe love you, how can you rob yourself of so priceless a treasure?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, shallow and mean heart of man!” exclaimed Zanoni, with unaccustomed\r\npassion and vehemence, “dost thou conceive so little of love as not to\r\nknow that it sacrifices all--love itself--for the happiness of the thing\r\nit loves? Hear me!” And Zanoni’s face grew pale. “Hear me! I press this\r\nupon you, because I love her, and because I fear that with me her fate\r\nwill be less fair than with yourself. Why,--ask not, for I will not\r\ntell you. Enough! Time presses now for your answer; it cannot long be\r\ndelayed. Before the night of the third day from this, all choice will be\r\nforbid you!”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Glyndon, still doubting and suspicious,--“but why this\r\nhaste?”\r\n\r\n“Man, you are not worthy of her when you ask me. All I can tell you\r\nhere, you should have known yourself. This ravisher, this man of will,\r\nthis son of the old Visconti, unlike you,--steadfast, resolute, earnest\r\neven in his crimes,--never relinquishes an object. But one passion\r\ncontrols his lust,--it is his avarice. The day after his attempt on\r\nViola, his uncle, the Cardinal --, from whom he has large expectations\r\nof land and gold, sent for him, and forbade him, on pain of forfeiting\r\nall the possessions which his schemes already had parcelled out, to\r\npursue with dishonourable designs one whom the Cardinal had heeded and\r\nloved from childhood. This is the cause of his present pause from his\r\npursuit. While we speak, the cause expires. Before the hand of the clock\r\nreaches the hour of noon, the Cardinal -- will be no more. At this very\r\nmoment thy friend, Jean Nicot, is with the Prince di --.”\r\n\r\n“He! wherefore?”\r\n\r\n“To ask what dower shall go with Viola Pisani, the morning that she\r\nleaves the palace of the prince.”\r\n\r\n“And how do you know all this?”\r\n\r\n“Fool! I tell thee again, because a lover is a watcher by night and day;\r\nbecause love never sleeps when danger menaces the beloved one!”\r\n\r\n“And you it was that informed the Cardinal --?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and what has been my task might as easily have been thine.\r\nSpeak,--thine answer!”\r\n\r\n“You shall have it on the third day from this.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so. Put off, poor waverer, thy happiness to the last hour. On the\r\nthird day from this, I will ask thee thy resolve.”\r\n\r\n“And where shall we meet?”\r\n\r\n“Before midnight, where you may least expect me. You cannot shun me,\r\nthough you may seek to do so!”\r\n\r\n“Stay one moment! You condemn me as doubtful, irresolute, suspicious.\r\nHave I no cause? Can I yield without a struggle to the strange\r\nfascination you exert upon my mind? What interest can you have in me, a\r\nstranger, that you should thus dictate to me the gravest action in the\r\nlife of man? Do you suppose that any one in his senses would not pause,\r\nand deliberate, and ask himself, ‘Why should this stranger care thus for\r\nme?’”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said Zanoni, “if I told thee that I could initiate thee into\r\nthe secrets of that magic which the philosophy of the whole existing\r\nworld treats as a chimera, or imposture; if I promised to show thee how\r\nto command the beings of air and ocean, how to accumulate wealth more\r\neasily than a child can gather pebbles on the shore, to place in thy\r\nhands the essence of the herbs which prolong life from age to age, the\r\nmystery of that attraction by which to awe all danger and disarm all\r\nviolence and subdue man as the serpent charms the bird,--if I told thee\r\nthat all these it was mine to possess and to communicate, thou wouldst\r\nlisten to me then, and obey me without a doubt!”\r\n\r\n“It is true; and I can account for this only by the imperfect\r\nassociations of my childhood,--by traditions in our house of--”\r\n\r\n“Your forefather, who, in the revival of science, sought the secrets of\r\nApollonius and Paracelsus.”\r\n\r\n“What!” said Glyndon, amazed, “are you so well acquainted with the\r\nannals of an obscure lineage?”\r\n\r\n“To the man who aspires to know, no man who has been the meanest\r\nstudent of knowledge should be unknown. You ask me why I have shown this\r\ninterest in your fate? There is one reason which I have not yet told\r\nyou. There is a fraternity as to whose laws and whose mysteries the most\r\ninquisitive schoolmen are in the dark. By those laws all are pledged to\r\nwarn, to aid, and to guide even the remotest descendants of men who\r\nhave toiled, though vainly, like your ancestor, in the mysteries of the\r\nOrder. We are bound to advise them to their welfare; nay, more,--if they\r\ncommand us to it, we must accept them as our pupils. I am a survivor\r\nof that most ancient and immemorial union. This it was that bound me to\r\nthee at the first; this, perhaps, attracted thyself unconsciously, Son\r\nof our Brotherhood, to me.”\r\n\r\n“If this be so, I command thee, in the name of the laws thou obeyest, to\r\nreceive me as thy pupil!”\r\n\r\n“What do you ask?” said Zanoni, passionately. “Learn, first, the\r\nconditions. No neophyte must have, at his initiation, one affection or\r\ndesire that chains him to the world. He must be pure from the love of\r\nwoman, free from avarice and ambition, free from the dreams even of\r\nart, or the hope of earthly fame. The first sacrifice thou must make\r\nis--Viola herself. And for what? For an ordeal that the most daring\r\ncourage only can encounter, the most ethereal natures alone survive!\r\nThou art unfit for the science that has made me and others what we are\r\nor have been; for thy whole nature is one fear!”\r\n\r\n“Fear!” cried Glyndon, colouring with resentment, and rising to the full\r\nheight of his stature.\r\n\r\n“Fear! and the worst fear,--fear of the world’s opinion; fear of the\r\nNicots and the Mervales; fear of thine own impulses when most generous;\r\nfear of thine own powers when thy genius is most bold; fear that virtue\r\nis not eternal; fear that God does not live in heaven to keep watch on\r\nearth; fear, the fear of little men; and that fear is never known to the\r\ngreat.”\r\n\r\nWith these words Zanoni abruptly left the artist, humbled, bewildered,\r\nand not convinced. He remained alone with his thoughts till he was\r\naroused by the striking of the clock; he then suddenly remembered\r\nZanoni’s prediction of the Cardinal’s death; and, seized with an intense\r\ndesire to learn its truth, he hurried into the streets,--he gained the\r\nCardinal’s palace. Five minutes before noon his Eminence had expired,\r\nafter an illness of less than an hour. Zanoni’s visit had occupied more\r\ntime than the illness of the Cardinal. Awed and perplexed, he turned\r\nfrom the palace, and as he walked through the Chiaja, he saw Jean Nicot\r\nemerge from the portals of the Prince di --.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.V.\r\n\r\n     Two loves I have of comfort and despair,\r\n     Which like two spirits do suggest me still.\r\n     --Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nVenerable Brotherhood, so sacred and so little known, from whose secret\r\nand precious archives the materials for this history have been drawn; ye\r\nwho have retained, from century to century, all that time has spared of\r\nthe august and venerable science,--thanks to you, if now, for the\r\nfirst time, some record of the thoughts and actions of no false and\r\nself-styled luminary of your Order be given, however imperfectly, to\r\nthe world. Many have called themselves of your band; many spurious\r\npretenders have been so-called by the learned ignorance which still,\r\nbaffled and perplexed, is driven to confess that it knows nothing of\r\nyour origin, your ceremonies or doctrines, nor even if you still have\r\nlocal habitation on the earth. Thanks to you if I, the only one of\r\nmy country, in this age, admitted, with a profane footstep, into your\r\nmysterious Academe (The reader will have the goodness to remember that\r\nthis is said by the author of the original MS., not by the editor.),\r\nhave been by you empowered and instructed to adapt to the comprehension\r\nof the uninitiated, some few of the starry truths which shone on the\r\ngreat Shemaia of the Chaldean Lore, and gleamed dimly through the\r\ndarkened knowledge of latter disciples, labouring, like Psellus and\r\nIamblichus, to revive the embers of the fire which burned in the Hamarin\r\nof the East. Though not to us of an aged and hoary world is vouchsafed\r\nthe NAME which, so say the earliest oracles of the earth, “rushes into\r\nthe infinite worlds,” yet is it ours to trace the reviving truths,\r\nthrough each new discovery of the philosopher and chemist. The laws of\r\nattraction, of electricity, and of the yet more mysterious agency of\r\nthat great principal of life, which, if drawn from the universe, would\r\nleave the universe a grave, were but the code in which the Theurgy of\r\nold sought the guides that led it to a legislation and science of its\r\nown. To rebuild on words the fragments of this history, it seems to me\r\nas if, in a solemn trance, I was led through the ruins of a city whose\r\nonly remains were tombs. From the sarcophagus and the urn I awake the\r\ngenius (The Greek Genius of Death.) of the extinguished Torch, and so\r\nclosely does its shape resemble Eros, that at moments I scarcely know\r\nwhich of ye dictates to me,--O Love! O Death!\r\n\r\nAnd it stirred in the virgin’s heart,--this new, unfathomable, and\r\ndivine emotion! Was it only the ordinary affection of the pulse and the\r\nfancy, of the eye to the Beautiful, of the ear to the Eloquent, or did\r\nit not justify the notion she herself conceived of it,--that it was born\r\nnot of the senses, that it was less of earthly and human love than the\r\neffect of some wondrous but not unholy charm? I said that, from that day\r\nin which, no longer with awe and trembling, she surrendered herself to\r\nthe influence of Zanoni, she had sought to put her thoughts into words.\r\nLet the thoughts attest their own nature.\r\n\r\nTHE SELF CONFESSIONAL.\r\n\r\n“Is it the daylight that shines on me, or the memory of thy presence?\r\nWherever I look, the world seems full of thee; in every ray that\r\ntrembles on the water, that smiles upon the leaves, I behold but a\r\nlikeness to thine eyes. What is this change, that alters not only\r\nmyself, but the face of the whole universe?\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“How instantaneously leaped into life the power with which thou swayest\r\nmy heart in its ebb and flow. Thousands were around me, and I saw but\r\nthee. That was the night in which I first entered upon the world which\r\ncrowds life into a drama, and has no language but music. How strangely\r\nand how suddenly with thee became that world evermore connected! What\r\nthe delusion of the stage was to others, thy presence was to me. My\r\nlife, too, seemed to centre into those short hours, and from thy lips\r\nI heard a music, mute to all ears but mine. I sit in the room where my\r\nfather dwelt. Here, on that happy night, forgetting why THEY were so\r\nhappy, I shrunk into the shadow, and sought to guess what thou wert to\r\nme; and my mother’s low voice woke me, and I crept to my father’s side,\r\nclose--close, from fear of my own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Ah! sweet and sad was the morrow to that night, when thy lips warned me\r\nof the future. An orphan now,--what is there that lives for me to think\r\nof, to dream upon, to revere, but thou!\r\n\r\n“How tenderly thou hast rebuked me for the grievous wrong that my\r\nthoughts did thee! Why should I have shuddered to feel thee glancing\r\nupon my thoughts like the beam on the solitary tree, to which thou didst\r\nonce liken me so well? It was--it was, that, like the tree, I struggled\r\nfor the light, and the light came. They tell me of love, and my very\r\nlife of the stage breathes the language of love into my lips. No; again\r\nand again, I know THAT is not the love that I feel for thee!--it is not\r\na passion, it is a thought! I ask not to be loved again. I murmur not\r\nthat thy words are stern and thy looks are cold. I ask not if I have\r\nrivals; I sigh not to be fair in thine eyes. It is my SPIRIT that would\r\nblend itself with thine. I would give worlds, though we were apart,\r\nthough oceans rolled between us, to know the hour in which thy gaze was\r\nlifted to the stars,--in which thy heart poured itself in prayer. They\r\ntell me thou art more beautiful than the marble images that are fairer\r\nthan all human forms; but I have never dared to gaze steadfastly on thy\r\nface, that memory might compare thee with the rest. Only thine eyes and\r\nthy soft, calm smile haunt me; as when I look upon the moon, all that\r\npasses into my heart is her silent light.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“Often, when the air is calm, I have thought that I hear the strains of\r\nmy father’s music; often, though long stilled in the grave, have they\r\nwaked me from the dreams of the solemn night. Methinks, ere thou comest\r\nto me that I hear them herald thy approach. Methinks I hear them wail\r\nand moan, when I sink back into myself on seeing thee depart. Thou art\r\nOF that music,--its spirit, its genius. My father must have guessed\r\nat thee and thy native regions, when the winds hushed to listen to his\r\ntones, and the world deemed him mad! I hear where I sit, the far murmur\r\nof the sea. Murmur on, ye blessed waters! The waves are the pulses of\r\nthe shore. They beat with the gladness of the morning wind,--so beats my\r\nheart in the freshness and light that make up the thoughts of thee!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“Often in my childhood I have mused and asked for what I was born; and\r\nmy soul answered my heart and said, ‘THOU WERT BORN TO WORSHIP!’ Yes; I\r\nknow why the real world has ever seemed to me so false and cold. I know\r\nwhy the world of the stage charmed and dazzled me. I know why it was so\r\nsweet to sit apart and gaze my whole being into the distant heavens.\r\nMy nature is not formed for this life, happy though that life seem to\r\nothers. It is its very want to have ever before it some image loftier\r\nthan itself! Stranger, in what realm above, when the grave is past,\r\nshall my soul, hour after hour, worship at the same source as thine?\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“In the gardens of my neighbour there is a small fountain. I stood by it\r\nthis morning after sunrise. How it sprung up, with its eager spray, to\r\nthe sunbeams! And then I thought that I should see thee again this day,\r\nand so sprung my heart to the new morning which thou bringest me from\r\nthe skies.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“I HAVE seen, I have LISTENED to thee again. How bold I have become! I\r\nran on with my childlike thoughts and stories, my recollections of the\r\npast, as if I had known thee from an infant. Suddenly the idea of my\r\npresumption struck me. I stopped, and timidly sought thine eyes.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, and when you found that the nightingale refused to sing?’--\r\n\r\n“‘Ah!’ I said, ‘what to thee this history of the heart of a child?’\r\n\r\n“‘Viola,’ didst thou answer, with that voice, so inexpressibly calm\r\nand earnest!--‘Viola, the darkness of a child’s heart is often but the\r\nshadow of a star. Speak on! And thy nightingale, when they caught and\r\ncaged it, refused to sing?’\r\n\r\n“‘And I placed the cage yonder, amidst the vine-leaves, and took up my\r\nlute, and spoke to it on the strings; for I thought that all music was\r\nits native language, and it would understand that I sought to comfort\r\nit.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ saidst thou. ‘And at last it answered thee, but not with\r\nsong,--in a sharp, brief cry; so mournful, that thy hands let fall the\r\nlute, and the tears gushed from thine eyes. So softly didst thou unbar\r\nthe cage, and the nightingale flew into yonder thicket; and thou heardst\r\nthe foliage rustle, and, looking through the moonlight, thine eyes saw\r\nthat it had found its mate. It sang to thee then from the boughs a long,\r\nloud, joyous jubilee. And musing, thou didst feel that it was not the\r\nvine-leaves or the moonlight that made the bird give melody to night,\r\nand that the secret of its music was the presence of a thing beloved.’\r\n\r\n“How didst thou know my thoughts in that childlike time better than\r\nI knew myself! How is the humble life of my past years, with its\r\nmean events, so mysteriously familiar to thee, bright stranger! I\r\nwonder,--but I do not again dare to fear thee!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“Once the thought of him oppressed and weighed me down. As an infant\r\nthat longs for the moon, my being was one vague desire for something\r\nnever to be attained. Now I feel rather as if to think of thee sufficed\r\nto remove every fetter from my spirit. I float in the still seas of\r\nlight, and nothing seems too high for my wings, too glorious for my\r\neyes. It was mine ignorance that made me fear thee. A knowledge that is\r\nnot in books seems to breathe around thee as an atmosphere. How little\r\nhave I read!--how little have I learned! Yet when thou art by my side,\r\nit seems as if the veil were lifted from all wisdom and all Nature. I\r\nstartle when I look even at the words I have written; they seem not to\r\ncome from myself, but are the signs of another language which thou hast\r\ntaught my heart, and which my hand traces rapidly, as at thy dictation.\r\nSometimes, while I write or muse, I could fancy that I heard light wings\r\nhovering around me, and saw dim shapes of beauty floating round, and\r\nvanishing as they smiled upon me. No unquiet and fearful dream ever\r\ncomes to me now in sleep, yet sleep and waking are alike but as one\r\ndream. In sleep I wander with thee, not through the paths of earth, but\r\nthrough impalpable air--an air which seems a music--upward and upward,\r\nas the soul mounts on the tones of a lyre! Till I knew thee, I was as a\r\nslave to the earth. Thou hast given to me the liberty of the universe!\r\nBefore, it was life; it seems to me now as if I had commenced eternity!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“Formerly, when I was to appear upon the stage, my heart beat more\r\nloudly. I trembled to encounter the audience, whose breath gave shame or\r\nrenown; and now I have no fear of them. I see them, heed them, hear them\r\nnot! I know that there will be music in my voice, for it is a hymn that\r\nI pour to thee. Thou never comest to the theatre; and that no longer\r\ngrieves me. Thou art become too sacred to appear a part of the common\r\nworld, and I feel glad that thou art not by when crowds have a right to\r\njudge me.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“And he spoke to me of ANOTHER: to another he would consign me! No, it\r\nis not love that I feel for thee, Zanoni; or why did I hear thee without\r\nanger, why did thy command seem to me not a thing impossible? As\r\nthe strings of the instrument obey the hand of the master, thy look\r\nmodulates the wildest chords of my heart to thy will. If it please\r\nthee,--yes, let it be so. Thou art lord of my destinies; they cannot\r\nrebel against thee! I almost think I could love him, whoever it be, on\r\nwhom thou wouldst shed the rays that circumfuse thyself. Whatever thou\r\nhast touched, I love; whatever thou speakest of, I love. Thy hand played\r\nwith these vine leaves; I wear them in my bosom. Thou seemest to me the\r\nsource of all love; too high and too bright to be loved thyself,\r\nbut darting light into other objects, on which the eye can gaze less\r\ndazzled. No, no; it is not love that I feel for thee, and therefore\r\nit is that I do not blush to nourish and confess it. Shame on me if I\r\nloved, knowing myself so worthless a thing to thee!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“ANOTHER!--my memory echoes back that word. Another! Dost thou mean that\r\nI shall see thee no more? It is not sadness,--it is not despair that\r\nseizes me. I cannot weep. It is an utter sense of desolation. I am\r\nplunged back into the common life; and I shudder coldly at the solitude.\r\nBut I will obey thee, if thou wilt. Shall I not see thee again beyond\r\nthe grave? O how sweet it were to die!\r\n\r\n“Why do I not struggle from the web in which my will is thus entangled?\r\nHast thou a right to dispose of me thus? Give me back--give me back the\r\nlife I knew before I gave life itself away to thee. Give me back the\r\ncareless dreams of my youth,---my liberty of heart that sung aloud as it\r\nwalked the earth. Thou hast disenchanted me of everything that is not\r\nof thyself. Where was the sin, at least, to think of thee,--to see thee?\r\nThy kiss still glows upon my hand; is that hand mine to bestow? Thy kiss\r\nclaimed and hallowed it to thyself. Stranger, I will NOT obey thee.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“Another day,--one day of the fatal three is gone! It is strange to me\r\nthat since the sleep of the last night, a deep calm has settled upon my\r\nbreast. I feel so assured that my very being is become a part of thee,\r\nthat I cannot believe that my life can be separated from thine; and in\r\nthis conviction I repose, and smile even at thy words and my own\r\nfears. Thou art fond of one maxim, which thou repeatest in a thousand\r\nforms,--that the beauty of the soul is faith; that as ideal loveliness\r\nto the sculptor, faith is to the heart; that faith, rightly understood,\r\nextends over all the works of the Creator, whom we can know but through\r\nbelief; that it embraces a tranquil confidence in ourselves, and a\r\nserene repose as to our future; that it is the moonlight that sways the\r\ntides of the human sea. That faith I comprehend now. I reject all doubt,\r\nall fear. I know that I have inextricably linked the whole that makes\r\nthe inner life to thee; and thou canst not tear me from thee, if\r\nthou wouldst! And this change from struggle into calm came to me\r\nwith sleep,--a sleep without a dream; but when I woke, it was with\r\na mysterious sense of happiness,--an indistinct memory of something\r\nblessed,--as if thou hadst cast from afar off a smile upon my slumber.\r\nAt night I was so sad; not a blossom that had not closed itself up, as\r\nif never more to open to the sun; and the night itself, in the heart\r\nas on the earth, has ripened the blossoms into flowers. The world is\r\nbeautiful once more, but beautiful in repose,--not a breeze stirs thy\r\ntree, not a doubt my soul!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.VI.\r\n\r\n     Tu vegga o per violenzia o per inganno\r\n     Patire o disonore o mortal danno.\r\n     “Orlando Furioso,” Cant. xlii. i.\r\n\r\n     (Thou art about, either through violence or artifice, to suffer\r\n     either dishonour or mortal loss.)\r\n\r\nIt was a small cabinet; the walls were covered with pictures, one of\r\nwhich was worth more than the whole lineage of the owner of the palace.\r\nOh, yes! Zanoni was right. The painter IS a magician; the gold he at\r\nleast wrings from his crucible is no delusion. A Venetian noble might be\r\na fribble, or an assassin,--a scoundrel, or a dolt; worthless, or worse\r\nthan worthless, yet he might have sat to Titian, and his portrait may\r\nbe inestimable,--a few inches of painted canvas a thousand times more\r\nvaluable than a man with his veins and muscles, brain, will, heart, and\r\nintellect!\r\n\r\nIn this cabinet sat a man of about three-and-forty,--dark-eyed, sallow,\r\nwith short, prominent features, a massive conformation of jaw, and\r\nthick, sensual, but resolute lips; this man was the Prince di --. His\r\nform, above the middle height, and rather inclined to corpulence, was\r\nclad in a loose dressing-robe of rich brocade. On a table before him lay\r\nan old-fashioned sword and hat, a mask, dice and dice-box, a portfolio,\r\nand an inkstand of silver curiously carved.\r\n\r\n“Well, Mascari,” said the prince, looking up towards his parasite, who\r\nstood by the embrasure of the deep-set barricadoed window,--“well! the\r\nCardinal sleeps with his fathers. I require comfort for the loss of\r\nso excellent a relation; and where a more dulcet voice than Viola\r\nPisani’s?”\r\n\r\n“Is your Excellency serious? So soon after the death of his Eminence?”\r\n\r\n“It will be the less talked of, and I the less suspected. Hast thou\r\nascertained the name of the insolent who baffled us that night, and\r\nadvised the Cardinal the next day?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“Sapient Mascari! I will inform thee. It was the strange Unknown.”\r\n\r\n“The Signor Zanoni! Are you sure, my prince?”\r\n\r\n“Mascari, yes. There is a tone in that man’s voice that I never can\r\nmistake; so clear, and so commanding, when I hear it I almost fancy\r\nthere is such a thing as conscience. However, we must rid ourselves of\r\nan impertinent. Mascari, Signor Zanoni hath not yet honoured our poor\r\nhouse with his presence. He is a distinguished stranger,--we must give a\r\nbanquet in his honour.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, and the Cyprus wine! The cypress is a proper emblem of the grave.”\r\n\r\n“But this anon. I am superstitious; there are strange stories of\r\nZanoni’s power and foresight; remember the death of Ughelli. No matter,\r\nthough the Fiend were his ally, he should not rob me of my prize; no,\r\nnor my revenge.”\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency is infatuated; the actress has bewitched you.”\r\n\r\n“Mascari,” said the prince, with a haughty smile, “through these veins\r\nrolls the blood of the old Visconti--of those who boasted that no woman\r\never escaped their lust, and no man their resentment. The crown of my\r\nfathers has shrunk into a gewgaw and a toy,--their ambition and their\r\nspirit are undecayed! My honour is now enlisted in this pursuit,--Viola\r\nmust be mine!”\r\n\r\n“Another ambuscade?” said Mascari, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Nay, why not enter the house itself?--the situation is lonely, and the\r\ndoor is not made of iron.”\r\n\r\n“But what if, on her return home, she tell the tale of our violence? A\r\nhouse forced,--a virgin stolen! Reflect; though the feudal privileges\r\nare not destroyed, even a Visconti is not now above the law.”\r\n\r\n“Is he not, Mascari? Fool! in what age of the world, even if the Madmen\r\nof France succeed in their chimeras, will the iron of law not bend\r\nitself, like an osier twig, to the strong hand of power and gold? But\r\nlook not so pale, Mascari; I have foreplanned all things. The day that\r\nshe leaves this palace, she will leave it for France, with Monsieur Jean\r\nNicot.”\r\n\r\nBefore Mascari could reply, the gentleman of the chamber announced the\r\nSignor Zanoni.\r\n\r\nThe prince involuntarily laid his hand upon the sword placed on the\r\ntable, then with a smile at his own impulse, rose, and met his visitor\r\nat the threshold, with all the profuse and respectful courtesy of\r\nItalian simulation.\r\n\r\n“This is an honour highly prized,” said the prince. “I have long desired\r\nto clasp the hand of one so distinguished.”\r\n\r\n“And I give it in the spirit with which you seek it,” replied Zanoni.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan bowed over the hand he pressed; but as he touched it a\r\nshiver came over him, and his heart stood still. Zanoni bent on him his\r\ndark, smiling eyes, and then seated himself with a familiar air.\r\n\r\n“Thus it is signed and sealed; I mean our friendship, noble prince. And\r\nnow I will tell you the object of my visit. I find, Excellency, that,\r\nunconsciously perhaps, we are rivals. Can we not accommodate out\r\npretensions!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the prince, carelessly, “you, then, were the cavalier who\r\nrobbed me of the reward of my chase. All stratagems fair in love, as in\r\nwar. Reconcile our pretensions! Well, here is the dice-box; let us throw\r\nfor her. He who casts the lowest shall resign his claim.”\r\n\r\n“Is this a decision by which you will promise to be bound?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, on my faith.”\r\n\r\n“And for him who breaks his word so plighted, what shall be the\r\nforfeit?”\r\n\r\n“The sword lies next to the dice-box, Signor Zanoni. Let him who stands\r\nnot by his honour fall by the sword.”\r\n\r\n“And you invoke that sentence if either of us fail his word? Be it so;\r\nlet Signor Mascari cast for us.”\r\n\r\n“Well said!--Mascari, the dice!”\r\n\r\nThe prince threw himself back in his chair; and, world-hardened as he\r\nwas, could not suppress the glow of triumph and satisfaction that spread\r\nitself over his features. Mascari took up the three dice, and rattled\r\nthem noisily in the box. Zanoni, leaning his cheek on his hand, and\r\nbending over the table, fixed his eyes steadfastly on the parasite;\r\nMascari in vain struggled to extricate from that searching gaze; he grew\r\npale, and trembled, he put down the box.\r\n\r\n“I give the first throw to your Excellency. Signor Mascari, be pleased\r\nto terminate our suspense.”\r\n\r\nAgain Mascari took up the box; again his hand shook so that the dice\r\nrattled within. He threw; the numbers were sixteen.\r\n\r\n“It is a high throw,” said Zanoni, calmly; “nevertheless, Signor\r\nMascari, I do not despond.”\r\n\r\nMascari gathered up the dice, shook the box, and rolled the contents\r\nonce more on the table: the number was the highest that can be\r\nthrown,--eighteen.\r\n\r\nThe prince darted a glance of fire at his minion, who stood with gaping\r\nmouth, staring at the dice, and trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“I have won, you see,” said Zanoni; “may we be friends still?”\r\n\r\n“Signor,” said the prince, obviously struggling with anger and\r\nconfusion, “the victory is yours. But pardon me, you have spoken lightly\r\nof this young girl,--will anything tempt you to yield your claim?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, do not think so ill of my gallantry; and,” resumed Zanoni, with a\r\nstern meaning in his voice, “forget not the forfeit your own lips have\r\nnamed.”\r\n\r\nThe prince knit his brow, but constrained the haughty answer that was\r\nhis first impulse.\r\n\r\n“Enough!” he said, forcing a smile; “I yield. Let me prove that I do not\r\nyield ungraciously; will you favour me with your presence at a little\r\nfeast I propose to give in honour,” he added, with a sardonic mockery,\r\n“of the elevation of my kinsman, the late Cardinal, of pious memory, to\r\nthe true seat of St. Peter?”\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed, a happiness to hear one command of yours I can obey.”\r\n\r\nZanoni then turned the conversation, talked lightly and gayly, and soon\r\nafterwards departed.\r\n\r\n“Villain!” then exclaimed the prince, grasping Mascari by the collar,\r\n“you betrayed me!”\r\n\r\n“I assure your Excellency that the dice were properly arranged; he\r\nshould have thrown twelve; but he is the Devil, and that’s the end of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“There is no time to be lost,” said the prince, quitting his hold of his\r\nparasite, who quietly resettled his cravat.\r\n\r\n“My blood is up,--I will win this girl, if I die for it! What noise is\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“It is but the sword of your illustrious ancestor that has fallen from\r\nthe table.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.VII.\r\n\r\n     Il ne faut appeler aucun ordre si ce n’est en tems clair et\r\n     serein.\r\n     “Les Clavicules du Rabbi Salomon.”\r\n\r\n     (No order of spirits must be invoked unless the weather be clear\r\n     and serene.)\r\n\r\nLetter from Zanoni to Mejnour.\r\n\r\nMy art is already dim and troubled. I have lost the tranquillity which\r\nis power. I cannot influence the decisions of those whom I would most\r\nguide to the shore; I see them wander farther and deeper into the\r\ninfinite ocean where our barks sail evermore to the horizon that flies\r\nbefore us! Amazed and awed to find that I can only warn where I would\r\ncontrol, I have looked into my own soul. It is true that the desires of\r\nearth chain me to the present, and shut me from the solemn secrets which\r\nIntellect, purified from all the dross of the clay, alone can examine\r\nand survey. The stern condition on which we hold our nobler and diviner\r\ngifts darkens our vision towards the future of those for whom we know\r\nthe human infirmities of jealousy or hate or love. Mejnour, all around\r\nme is mist and haze; I have gone back in our sublime existence; and\r\nfrom the bosom of the imperishable youth that blooms only in the spirit,\r\nsprings up the dark poison-flower of human love.\r\n\r\nThis man is not worthy of her,--I know that truth; yet in his nature\r\nare the seeds of good and greatness, if the tares and weeds of worldly\r\nvanities and fears would suffer them to grow. If she were his, and I had\r\nthus transplanted to another soil the passion that obscures my gaze and\r\ndisarms my power, unseen, unheard, unrecognised, I could watch over his\r\nfate, and secretly prompt his deeds, and minister to her welfare through\r\nhis own. But time rushes on! Through the shadows that encircle me, I\r\nsee, gathering round her, the darkest dangers. No choice but flight,--no\r\nescape save with him or me. With me!--the rapturous thought,--the\r\nterrible conviction! With me! Mejnour, canst thou wonder that I would\r\nsave her from myself? A moment in the life of ages,--a bubble on the\r\nshoreless sea. What else to me can be human love? And in this exquisite\r\nnature of hers,--more pure, more spiritual, even in its young affections\r\nthan ever heretofore the countless volumes of the heart, race after\r\nrace, have given to my gaze: there is yet a deep-buried feeling\r\nthat warns me of inevitable woe. Thou austere and remorseless\r\nHierophant,--thou who hast sought to convert to our brotherhood every\r\nspirit that seemed to thee most high and bold,--even thou knowest, by\r\nhorrible experience, how vain the hope to banish FEAR from the heart of\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nMy life would be to her one marvel. Even if, on the other hand, I sought\r\nto guide her path through the realms of terror to the light, think of\r\nthe Haunter of the Threshold, and shudder with me at the awful hazard!\r\nI have endeavoured to fill the Englishman’s ambition with the true\r\nglory of his art; but the restless spirit of his ancestor still seems to\r\nwhisper in him, and to attract to the spheres in which it lost its own\r\nwandering way. There is a mystery in man’s inheritance from his fathers.\r\nPeculiarities of the mind, as diseases of the body, rest dormant for\r\ngenerations, to revive in some distant descendant, baffle all treatment\r\nand elude all skill. Come to me from thy solitude amidst the wrecks of\r\nRome! I pant for a living confidant,--for one who in the old time has\r\nhimself known jealousy and love. I have sought commune with Adon-Ai; but\r\nhis presence, that once inspired such heavenly content with knowledge,\r\nand so serene a confidence in destiny, now only troubles and perplexes\r\nme. From the height from which I strive to search into the shadows of\r\nthings to come, I see confused spectres of menace and wrath. Methinks I\r\nbehold a ghastly limit to the wondrous existence I have held,--methinks\r\nthat, after ages of the Ideal Life, I see my course merge into the most\r\nstormy whirlpool of the Real. Where the stars opened to me their gates,\r\nthere looms a scaffold,--thick steams of blood rise as from a shambles.\r\nWhat is more strange to me, a creature here, a very type of the false\r\nideal of common men,--body and mind, a hideous mockery of the art that\r\nshapes the Beautiful, and the desires that seek the Perfect, ever haunts\r\nmy vision amidst these perturbed and broken clouds of the fate to be.\r\nBy that shadowy scaffold it stands and gibbers at me, with lips dropping\r\nslime and gore. Come, O friend of the far-time; for me, at least, thy\r\nwisdom has not purged away thy human affections. According to the bonds\r\nof our solemn order, reduced now to thee and myself, lone survivors of\r\nso many haughty and glorious aspirants, thou art pledged, too, to warn\r\nthe descendant of those whom thy counsels sought to initiate into the\r\ngreat secret in a former age. The last of that bold Visconti who was\r\nonce thy pupil is the relentless persecutor of this fair child. With\r\nthoughts of lust and murder, he is digging his own grave; thou mayest\r\nyet daunt him from his doom. And I also mysteriously, by the same bond,\r\nam pledged to obey, if he so command, a less guilty descendant of a\r\nbaffled but nobler student. If he reject my counsel, and insist upon\r\nthe pledge, Mejnour, thou wilt have another neophyte. Beware of another\r\nvictim! Come to me! This will reach thee with all speed. Answer it by\r\nthe pressure of one hand that I can dare to clasp!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.VIII.\r\n\r\n     Il lupo\r\n     Ferito, credo, mi conobbe e ‘ncontro\r\n     Mi venne con la bocca sanguinosa.\r\n     “Aminta,” At. iv. Sc. i.\r\n\r\n     (The wounded wolf, I think, knew me, and came to meet me with its\r\n     bloody mouth.)\r\n\r\nAt Naples, the tomb of Virgil, beetling over the cave of Posilipo, is\r\nreverenced, not with the feelings that should hallow the memory of the\r\npoet, but the awe that wraps the memory of the magician. To his charms\r\nthey ascribe the hollowing of that mountain passage; and tradition yet\r\nguards his tomb by the spirits he had raised to construct the cavern.\r\nThis spot, in the immediate vicinity of Viola’s home, had often\r\nattracted her solitary footsteps. She had loved the dim and solemn\r\nfancies that beset her as she looked into the lengthened gloom of the\r\ngrotto, or, ascending to the tomb, gazed from the rock on the dwarfed\r\nfigures of the busy crowd that seemed to creep like insects along the\r\nwindings of the soil below; and now, at noon, she bent thither her\r\nthoughtful way. She threaded the narrow path, she passed the gloomy\r\nvineyard that clambers up the rock, and gained the lofty spot, green\r\nwith moss and luxuriant foliage, where the dust of him who yet soothes\r\nand elevates the minds of men is believed to rest. From afar rose the\r\nhuge fortress of St. Elmo, frowning darkly amidst spires and domes that\r\nglittered in the sun. Lulled in its azure splendour lay the Siren’s sea;\r\nand the grey smoke of Vesuvius, in the clear distance, soared like\r\na moving pillar into the lucid sky. Motionless on the brink of the\r\nprecipice, Viola looked upon the lovely and living world that stretched\r\nbelow; and the sullen vapour of Vesuvius fascinated her eye yet more\r\nthan the scattered gardens, or the gleaming Caprea, smiling amidst the\r\nsmiles of the sea. She heard not a step that had followed her on her\r\npath and started to hear a voice at hand. So sudden was the apparition\r\nof the form that stood by her side, emerging from the bushes that clad\r\nthe crags, and so singularly did it harmonise in its uncouth ugliness\r\nwith the wild nature of the scene immediately around her, and the wizard\r\ntraditions of the place, that the colour left her cheek, and a faint cry\r\nbroke from her lips.\r\n\r\n“Tush, pretty trembler!--do not be frightened at my face,” said the\r\nman, with a bitter smile. “After three months’ marriage, there is no\r\ndifferent between ugliness and beauty. Custom is a great leveller. I was\r\ncoming to your house when I saw you leave it; so, as I have matters of\r\nimportance to communicate, I ventured to follow your footsteps. My name\r\nis Jean Nicot, a name already favourably known as a French artist. The\r\nart of painting and the art of music are nearly connected, and the stage\r\nis an altar that unites the two.”\r\n\r\nThere was something frank and unembarrassed in the man’s address that\r\nserved to dispel the fear his appearance had occasioned. He seated\r\nhimself, as he spoke, on a crag beside her, and, looking up steadily\r\ninto her face, continued:--\r\n\r\n“You are very beautiful, Viola Pisani, and I am not surprised at the\r\nnumber of your admirers. If I presume to place myself in the list, it is\r\nbecause I am the only one who loves thee honestly, and woos thee fairly.\r\nNay, look not so indignant! Listen to me. Has the Prince di -- ever\r\nspoken to thee of marriage; or the beautiful imposter Zanoni, or the\r\nyoung blue-eyed Englishman, Clarence Glyndon? It is marriage,--it is a\r\nhome, it is safety, it is reputation, that I offer to thee; and these\r\nlast when the straight form grows crooked, and the bright eyes dim. What\r\nsay you?” and he attempted to seize her hand.\r\n\r\nViola shrunk from him, and silently turned to depart. He rose abruptly\r\nand placed himself on her path.\r\n\r\n“Actress, you must hear me! Do you know what this calling of the stage\r\nis in the eyes of prejudice,--that is, of the common opinion of mankind?\r\nIt is to be a princess before the lamps, and a Pariah before the day.\r\nNo man believes in your virtue, no man credits your vows; you are the\r\npuppet that they consent to trick out with tinsel for their amusement,\r\nnot an idol for their worship. Are you so enamoured of this career\r\nthat you scorn even to think of security and honour? Perhaps you are\r\ndifferent from what you seem. Perhaps you laugh at the prejudice that\r\nwould degrade you, and would wisely turn it to advantage. Speak frankly\r\nto me; I have no prejudice either. Sweet one, I am sure we should agree.\r\nNow, this Prince di --, I have a message from him. Shall I deliver it?”\r\n\r\nNever had Viola felt as she felt then, never had she so thoroughly seen\r\nall the perils of her forelorn condition and her fearful renown. Nicot\r\ncontinued:--\r\n\r\n“Zanoni would but amuse himself with thy vanity; Glyndon would despise\r\nhimself, if he offered thee his name, and thee, if thou wouldst accept\r\nit; but the Prince di -- is in earnest, and he is wealthy. Listen!”\r\n\r\nAnd Nicot approached his lips to her, and hissed a sentence which she\r\ndid not suffer him to complete. She darted from him with one glance of\r\nunutterable disdain. As he strove to regain his hold of her arm, he\r\nlost his footing, and fell down the sides of the rock till, bruised and\r\nlacerated, a pine-branch saved him from the yawning abyss below. She\r\nheard his exclamation of rage and pain as she bounded down the path,\r\nand, without once turning to look behind, regained her home. By the\r\nporch stood Glyndon, conversing with Gionetta. She passed him\r\nabruptly, entered the house, and, sinking on the floor, wept loud and\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\nGlyndon, who had followed her in surprise, vainly sought to soothe and\r\ncalm her. She would not reply to his questions; she did not seem to\r\nlisten to his protestations of love, till suddenly, as Nicot’s terrible\r\npicture of the world’s judgment of that profession which to her younger\r\nthoughts had seemed the service of Song and the Beautiful, forced itself\r\nupon her, she raised her face from her hands, and, looking steadily upon\r\nthe Englishman, said, “False one, dost thou talk of me of love?”\r\n\r\n“By my honour, words fail to tell thee how I love!”\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou give me thy home, thy name? Dost thou woo me as thy wife?”\r\n And at that moment, had Glyndon answered as his better angel would have\r\ncounselled, perhaps, in that revolution of her whole mind which the\r\nwords of Nicot had effected, which made her despise her very self,\r\nsicken of her lofty dreams, despair of the future, and distrust her\r\nwhole ideal,--perhaps, I say, in restoring her self-esteem,--he would\r\nhave won her confidence, and ultimately secured her love. But against\r\nthe prompting of his nobler nature rose up at that sudden question all\r\nthose doubts which, as Zanoni had so well implied, made the true enemies\r\nof his soul. Was he thus suddenly to be entangled into a snare laid for\r\nhis credulity by deceivers? Was she not instructed to seize the moment\r\nto force him into an avowal which prudence must repent? Was not the\r\ngreat actress rehearsing a premeditated part? He turned round, as these\r\nthoughts, the children of the world, passed across him, for he literally\r\nfancied that he heard the sarcastic laugh of Mervale without. Nor was\r\nhe deceived. Mervale was passing by the threshold, and Gionetta had told\r\nhim his friend was within. Who does not know the effect of the world’s\r\nlaugh? Mervale was the personation of the world. The whole world seemed\r\nto shout derision in those ringing tones. He drew back,--he recoiled.\r\nViola followed him with her earnest, impatient eyes. At last, he\r\nfaltered forth, “Do all of thy profession, beautiful Viola, exact\r\nmarriage as the sole condition of love?” Oh, bitter question! Oh,\r\npoisoned taunt! He repented it the moment after. He was seized with\r\nremorse of reason, of feeling, and of conscience. He saw her form\r\nshrink, as it were, at his cruel words. He saw the colour come and go,\r\nto leave the writhing lips like marble; and then, with a sad, gentle\r\nlook of self-pity, rather than reproach, she pressed her hands tightly\r\nto her bosom, and said,--\r\n\r\n“He was right! Pardon me, Englishman; I see now, indeed, that I am the\r\nPariah and the outcast.”\r\n\r\n“Hear me. I retract. Viola, Viola! it is for you to forgive!”\r\n\r\nBut Viola waved him from her, and, smiling mournfully as she passed him\r\nby, glided from the chamber; and he did not dare to detain her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.IX.\r\n\r\n     Dafne:  Ma, chi lung’ e d’Amor?\r\n     Tirsi:  Chi teme e fugge.\r\n     Dafne:  E che giova fuggir da lui ch’ ha l’ ali?\r\n     Tirsi:  AMOR NASCENTE HA CORTE L’ ALI!\r\n     “Aminta,” At. ii. Sc. ii.\r\n\r\n     (Dafne:  But, who is far from Love?\r\n     Tirsi:  He who fears and flies.\r\n     Dafne:  What use to flee from one who has wings?\r\n     Tirsi:  The wings of Love, while he yet grows, are short.)\r\n\r\nWhen Glyndon found himself without Viola’s house, Mervale, still\r\nloitering at the door, seized his arm. Glyndon shook him off abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Thou and thy counsels,” said he, bitterly, “have made me a coward and\r\na wretch. But I will go home,--I will write to her. I will pour out my\r\nwhole soul; she will forgive me yet.”\r\n\r\nMervale, who was a man of imperturbable temper, arranged his ruffles,\r\nwhich his friend’s angry gesture had a little discomposed, and not till\r\nGlyndon had exhausted himself awhile by passionate exclamations and\r\nreproaches, did the experienced angler begin to tighten the line. He\r\nthen drew from Glyndon the explanation of what had passed, and artfully\r\nsought not to irritate, but soothe him. Mervale, indeed, was by no means\r\na bad man; he had stronger moral notions than are common amongst the\r\nyoung. He sincerely reproved his friend for harbouring dishonourable\r\nintentions with regard to the actress. “Because I would not have her thy\r\nwife, I never dreamed that thou shouldst degrade her to thy mistress.\r\nBetter of the two an imprudent match than an illicit connection. But\r\npause yet, do not act on the impulse of the moment.”\r\n\r\n“But there is no time to lose. I have promised to Zanoni to give him my\r\nanswer by to-morrow night. Later than that time, all option ceases.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Mervale, “this seems suspicious. Explain yourself.”\r\n\r\nAnd Glyndon, in the earnestness of his passion, told his friend what\r\nhad passed between himself and Zanoni,--suppressing only, he scarce knew\r\nwhy, the reference to his ancestor and the mysterious brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThis recital gave to Mervale all the advantage he could desire. Heavens!\r\nwith what sound, shrewd common-sense he talked. How evidently some\r\ncharlatanic coalition between the actress, and perhaps,--who knows?--her\r\nclandestine protector, sated with possession! How equivocal the\r\ncharacter of one,--the position of the other! What cunning in the\r\nquestion of the actress! How profoundly had Glyndon, at the first\r\nsuggestion of his sober reason, seen through the snare. What! was he\r\nto be thus mystically cajoled and hurried into a rash marriage, because\r\nZanoni, a mere stranger, told him with a grave face that he must decide\r\nbefore the clock struck a certain hour?\r\n\r\n“Do this at least,” said Mervale, reasonably enough,--“wait till the\r\ntime expires; it is but another day. Baffle Zanoni. He tells thee that\r\nhe will meet thee before midnight to-morrow, and defies thee to avoid\r\nhim. Pooh! let us quit Naples for some neighbouring place, where, unless\r\nhe be indeed the Devil, he cannot possibly find us. Show him that you\r\nwill not be led blindfold even into an act that you meditate yourself.\r\nDefer to write to her, or to see her, till after to-morrow. This is all\r\nI ask. Then visit her, and decide for yourself.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon was staggered. He could not combat the reasonings of his friend;\r\nhe was not convinced, but he hesitated; and at that moment Nicot passed\r\nthem. He turned round, and stopped, as he saw Glyndon.\r\n\r\n“Well, and do you think still of the Pisani?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and you--”\r\n\r\n“Have seen and conversed with her. She shall be Madame Nicot before this\r\nday week! I am going to the cafe, in the Toledo; and hark ye, when next\r\nyou meet your friend Signor Zanoni, tell him that he has twice crossed\r\nmy path. Jean Nicot, though a painter, is a plain, honest man, and\r\nalways pays his debts.”\r\n\r\n“It is a good doctrine in money matters,” said Mervale; “as to revenge,\r\nit is not so moral, and certainly not so wise. But is it in your love\r\nthat Zanoni has crossed your path? How that, if your suit prosper so\r\nwell?”\r\n\r\n“Ask Viola Pisani that question. Bah! Glyndon, she is a prude only to\r\nthee. But I have no prejudices. Once more, farewell.”\r\n\r\n“Rouse thyself, man!” said Mervale, slapping Glyndon on the shoulder.\r\n“What think you of your fair one now?”\r\n\r\n“This man must lie.”\r\n\r\n“Will you write to her at once?”\r\n\r\n“No; if she be really playing a game, I could renounce her without a\r\nsigh. I will watch her closely; and, at all events, Zanoni shall not be\r\nthe master of my fate. Let us, as you advise, leave Naples at daybreak\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.X.\r\n\r\n     O chiunque tu sia, che fuor d’ogni uso\r\n     Pieghi Natura ad opre altere e strane,\r\n     E, spiando i segreti, entri al piu chiuso\r\n     Spazi’ a tua voglia delle menti umane--Deh, Dimmi!\r\n     “Gerus. Lib.,” Cant. x. xviii.\r\n\r\n     (O thou, whoever thou art, who through every use bendest Nature\r\n     to works foreign and strange; and by spying into her secrets,\r\n     enterest at thy will into the closest recesses of the human\r\n     mind,--O speak!  O tell me!)\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the young Englishmen mounted their horses, and\r\ntook the road towards Baiae. Glyndon left word at his hotel, that if\r\nSignor Zanoni sought him, it was in the neighbourhood of that once\r\ncelebrated watering-place of the ancients that he should be found.\r\n\r\nThey passed by Viola’s house, but Glyndon resisted the temptation of\r\npausing there; and after threading the grotto of Posilipo, they wound\r\nby a circuitous route back into the suburbs of the city, and took the\r\nopposite road, which conducts to Portici and Pompeii. It was late at\r\nnoon when they arrived at the former of these places. Here they halted\r\nto dine; for Mervale had heard much of the excellence of the macaroni at\r\nPortici, and Mervale was a bon vivant.\r\n\r\nThey put up at an inn of very humble pretensions, and dined under an\r\nawning. Mervale was more than usually gay; he pressed the lacrima upon\r\nhis friend, and conversed gayly.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear friend, we have foiled Signor Zanoni in one of his\r\npredictions at least. You will have no faith in him hereafter.”\r\n\r\n“The ides are come, not gone.”\r\n\r\n“Tush! If he be the soothsayer, you are not the Caesar. It is your\r\nvanity that makes you credulous. Thank Heaven, I do not think myself of\r\nsuch importance that the operations of Nature should be changed in order\r\nto frighten me.”\r\n\r\n“But why should the operations of Nature be changed? There may be a\r\ndeeper philosophy than we dream of,--a philosophy that discovers the\r\nsecrets of Nature, but does not alter, by penetrating, its courses.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you relapse into your heretical credulity; you seriously suppose\r\nZanoni to be a prophet,--a reader of the future; perhaps an associate of\r\ngenii and spirits!”\r\n\r\nHere the landlord, a little, fat, oily fellow, came up with a fresh\r\nbottle of lacrima. He hoped their Excellencies were pleased. He was most\r\ntouched--touched to the heart, that they liked the macaroni. Were their\r\nExcellencies going to Vesuvius? There was a slight eruption; they could\r\nnot see it where they were, but it was pretty, and would be prettier\r\nstill after sunset.\r\n\r\n“A capital idea!” cried Mervale. “What say you, Glyndon?”\r\n\r\n“I have not yet seen an eruption; I should like it much.”\r\n\r\n“But is there no danger?” asked the prudent Mervale.\r\n\r\n“Oh, not at all; the mountain is very civil at present. It only plays a\r\nlittle, just to amuse their Excellencies the English.”\r\n\r\n“Well, order the horses, and bring the bill; we will go before it is\r\ndark. Clarence, my friend,--nunc est bibendum; but take care of the pede\r\nlibero, which will scarce do for walking on lava!”\r\n\r\nThe bottle was finished, the bill paid; the gentlemen mounted, the\r\nlandlord bowed, and they bent their way, in the cool of the delightful\r\nevening, towards Resina.\r\n\r\nThe wine, perhaps the excitement of his thoughts, animated Glyndon,\r\nwhose unequal spirits were, at times, high and brilliant as those of a\r\nschoolboy released; and the laughter of the Northern tourists sounded\r\noft and merrily along the melancholy domains of buried cities.\r\n\r\nHesperus had lighted his lamp amidst the rosy skies as they arrived at\r\nResina. Here they quitted their horses, and took mules and a guide.\r\nAs the sky grew darker and more dark, the mountain fire burned with an\r\nintense lustre. In various streaks and streamlets, the fountain of flame\r\nrolled down the dark summit, and the Englishmen began to feel increase\r\nupon them, as they ascended, that sensation of solemnity and awe which\r\nmakes the very atmosphere that surrounds the Giant of the Plains of the\r\nAntique Hades.\r\n\r\nIt was night, when, leaving the mules, they ascended on foot,\r\naccompanied by their guide, and a peasant who bore a rude torch. The\r\nguide was a conversable, garrulous fellow, like most of his country\r\nand his calling; and Mervale, who possessed a sociable temper, loved to\r\namuse or to instruct himself on every incidental occasion.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Excellency,” said the guide, “your countrymen have a strong passion\r\nfor the volcano. Long life to them, they bring us plenty of money! If\r\nour fortunes depended on the Neapolitans, we should starve.”\r\n\r\n“True, they have no curiosity,” said Mervale. “Do you remember, Glyndon,\r\nthe contempt with which that old count said to us, ‘You will go to\r\nVesuvius, I suppose? I have never been; why should I go? You have cold,\r\nyou have hunger, you have fatigue, you have danger, and all for\r\nnothing but to see fire, which looks just as well in a brazier as on a\r\nmountain.’ Ha! ha! the old fellow was right.”\r\n\r\n“But, Excellency,” said the guide, “that is not all: some cavaliers\r\nthink to ascend the mountain without our help. I am sure they deserve to\r\ntumble into the crater.”\r\n\r\n“They must be bold fellows to go alone; you don’t often find such.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes among the French, signor. But the other night--I never was\r\nso frightened--I had been with an English party, and a lady had left a\r\npocket-book on the mountain, where she had been sketching. She offered\r\nme a handsome sum to return for it, and bring it to her at Naples. So I\r\nwent in the evening. I found it, sure enough, and was about to return,\r\nwhen I saw a figure that seemed to emerge from the crater itself. The\r\nair there was so pestiferous that I could not have conceived a human\r\ncreature could breathe it, and live. I was so astounded that I stood\r\nstill as a stone, till the figure came over the hot ashes, and stood\r\nbefore me, face to face. Santa Maria, what a head!”\r\n\r\n“What! hideous?”\r\n\r\n“No; so beautiful, but so terrible. It had nothing human in its aspect.”\r\n\r\n“And what said the salamander?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing! It did not even seem to perceive me, though I was near as I am\r\nto you; but its eyes seemed to emerge prying into the air. It passed by\r\nme quickly, and, walking across a stream of burning lava, soon vanished\r\non the other side of the mountain. I was curious and foolhardy, and\r\nresolved to see if I could bear the atmosphere which this visitor had\r\nleft; but though I did not advance within thirty yards of the spot at\r\nwhich he had first appeared, I was driven back by a vapour that wellnigh\r\nstifled me. Cospetto! I have spat blood ever since.”\r\n\r\n“Now will I lay a wager that you fancy this fire-king must be Zanoni,”\r\n whispered Mervale, laughing.\r\n\r\nThe little party had now arrived nearly at the summit of the mountain;\r\nand unspeakably grand was the spectacle on which they gazed. From\r\nthe crater arose a vapour, intensely dark, that overspread the whole\r\nbackground of the heavens; in the centre whereof rose a flame that\r\nassumed a form singularly beautiful. It might have been compared to a\r\ncrest of gigantic feathers, the diadem of the mountain, high-arched, and\r\ndrooping downward, with the hues delicately shaded off, and the whole\r\nshifting and tremulous as the plumage on a warrior’s helmet.\r\n\r\nThe glare of the flame spread, luminous and crimson, over the dark and\r\nrugged ground on which they stood, and drew an innumerable variety of\r\nshadows from crag and hollow. An oppressive and sulphureous exhalation\r\nserved to increase the gloomy and sublime terror of the place. But on\r\nturning from the mountain, and towards the distant and unseen ocean, the\r\ncontrast was wonderfully great; the heavens serene and blue, the stars\r\nstill and calm as the eyes of Divine Love. It was as if the realms of\r\nthe opposing principles of Evil and of Good were brought in one\r\nview before the gaze of man! Glyndon--once more the enthusiast, the\r\nartist--was enchained and entranced by emotions vague and undefinable,\r\nhalf of delight and half of pain. Leaning on the shoulder of his friend,\r\nhe gazed around him, and heard with deepening awe the rumbling of the\r\nearth below, the wheels and voices of the Ministry of Nature in her\r\ndarkest and most inscrutable recess. Suddenly, as a bomb from a shell,\r\na huge stone was flung hundreds of yards up from the jaws of the crater,\r\nand falling with a mighty crash upon the rock below, split into ten\r\nthousand fragments, which bounded down the sides of the mountain,\r\nsparkling and groaning as they went. One of these, the largest fragment,\r\nstruck the narrow space of soil between the Englishmen and the guide,\r\nnot three feet from the spot where the former stood. Mervale uttered an\r\nexclamation of terror, and Glyndon held his breath, and shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Diavolo!” cried the guide. “Descend, Excellencies,--descend! we have\r\nnot a moment to lose; follow me close!”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the guide and the peasant fled with as much swiftness as they\r\nwere able to bring to bear. Mervale, ever more prompt and ready than his\r\nfriend, imitated their example; and Glyndon, more confused than alarmed,\r\nfollowed close. But they had not gone many yards, before, with a rushing\r\nand sudden blast, came from the crater an enormous volume of vapour. It\r\npursued,--it overtook, it overspread them. It swept the light from the\r\nheavens. All was abrupt and utter darkness; and through the gloom was\r\nheard the shout of the guide, already distant, and lost in an instant\r\namidst the sound of the rushing gust and the groans of the earth\r\nbeneath. Glyndon paused. He was separated from his friend, from the\r\nguide. He was alone,--with the Darkness and the Terror. The vapour\r\nrolled sullenly away; the form of the plumed fire was again dimly\r\nvisible, and its struggling and perturbed reflection again shed a\r\nglow over the horrors of the path. Glyndon recovered himself, and sped\r\nonward. Below, he heard the voice of Mervale calling on him, though\r\nhe no longer saw his form. The sound served as a guide. Dizzy and\r\nbreathless, he bounded forward; when--hark!--a sullen, slow rolling\r\nsounded in his ear! He halted,--and turned back to gaze. The fire had\r\noverflowed its course; it had opened itself a channel amidst the furrows\r\nof the mountain. The stream pursued him fast--fast; and the hot breath\r\nof the chasing and preternatural foe came closer and closer upon his\r\ncheek! He turned aside; he climbed desperately with hands and feet upon\r\na crag that, to the right, broke the scathed and blasted level of the\r\nsoil. The stream rolled beside and beneath him, and then taking a sudden\r\nwind round the spot on which he stood, interposed its liquid fire,--a\r\nbroad and impassable barrier between his resting-place and escape. There\r\nhe stood, cut off from descent, and with no alternative but to retrace\r\nhis steps towards the crater, and thence seek, without guide or clew,\r\nsome other pathway.\r\n\r\nFor a moment his courage left him; he cried in despair, and in that\r\noverstrained pitch of voice which is never heard afar off, to the guide,\r\nto Mervale, to return to aid him.\r\n\r\nNo answer came; and the Englishman, thus abandoned solely to his own\r\nresources, felt his spirit and energy rise against the danger. He turned\r\nback, and ventured as far towards the crater as the noxious exhalation\r\nwould permit; then, gazing below, carefully and deliberately he chalked\r\nout for himself a path by which he trusted to shun the direction the\r\nfire-stream had taken, and trod firmly and quickly over the crumbling\r\nand heated strata.\r\n\r\nHe had proceeded about fifty yards, when he halted abruptly; an\r\nunspeakable and unaccountable horror, not hitherto experienced amidst\r\nall his peril, came over him. He shook in every limb; his muscles\r\nrefused his will,--he felt, as it were, palsied and death-stricken. The\r\nhorror, I say, was unaccountable, for the path seemed clear and safe.\r\nThe fire, above and behind, burned clear and far; and beyond, the stars\r\nlent him their cheering guidance. No obstacle was visible,--no danger\r\nseemed at hand. As thus, spell-bound, and panic-stricken, he stood\r\nchained to the soil,--his breast heaving, large drops rolling down his\r\nbrow, and his eyes starting wildly from their sockets,--he saw before\r\nhim, at some distance, gradually shaping itself more and more distinctly\r\nto his gaze, a colossal shadow; a shadow that seemed partially borrowed\r\nfrom the human shape, but immeasurably above the human stature; vague,\r\ndark, almost formless; and differing, he could not tell where or why,\r\nnot only from the proportions, but also from the limbs and outline of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe glare of the volcano, that seemed to shrink and collapse from this\r\ngigantic and appalling apparition, nevertheless threw its light,\r\nredly and steadily, upon another shape that stood beside, quiet and\r\nmotionless; and it was, perhaps, the contrast of these two things--the\r\nBeing and the Shadow--that impressed the beholder with the difference\r\nbetween them,--the Man and the Superhuman. It was but for a moment--nay,\r\nfor the tenth part of a moment--that this sight was permitted to the\r\nwanderer. A second eddy of sulphureous vapours from the volcano, yet\r\nmore rapidly, yet more densely than its predecessor, rolled over the\r\nmountain; and either the nature of the exhalation, or the excess of his\r\nown dread, was such, that Glyndon, after one wild gasp for breath, fell\r\nsenseless on the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.XI.\r\n\r\n     Was hab’ich,\r\n     Wenn ich nicht Alles habe?--sprach der Jungling.\r\n     “Das Verschleierte Bild zu Sais.”\r\n\r\n     (“What have I, if I possess not All?” said the youth.)\r\n\r\nMervale and the Italians arrived in safety at the spot where they had\r\nleft the mules; and not till they had recovered their own alarm and\r\nbreath did they think of Glyndon. But then, as the minutes passed, and\r\nhe appeared not, Mervale, whose heart was as good at least as human\r\nhearts are in general, grew seriously alarmed. He insisted on returning\r\nto search for his friend; and by dint of prodigal promises prevailed at\r\nlast on the guide to accompany him. The lower part of the mountain lay\r\ncalm and white in the starlight; and the guide’s practised eye could\r\ndiscern all objects on the surface at a considerable distance. They\r\nhad not, however, gone very far, before they perceived two forms slowly\r\napproaching them.\r\n\r\nAs they came near, Mervale recognised the form of his friend. “Thank\r\nHeaven, he is safe!” he cried, turning to the guide.\r\n\r\n“Holy angels befriend us!” said the Italian, trembling,--“behold the\r\nvery being that crossed me last Friday night. It is he, but his face is\r\nhuman now!”\r\n\r\n“Signor Inglese,” said the voice of Zanoni, as Glyndon--pale, wan, and\r\nsilent--returned passively the joyous greeting of Mervale,--“Signor\r\nInglese, I told your friend that we should meet to-night. You see you\r\nhave NOT foiled my prediction.”\r\n\r\n“But how?--but where?” stammered Mervale, in great confusion and\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“I found your friend stretched on the ground, overpowered by the\r\nmephitic exhalation of the crater. I bore him to a purer atmosphere; and\r\nas I know the mountain well, I have conducted him safely to you. This is\r\nall our history. You see, sir, that were it not for that prophecy which\r\nyou desired to frustrate, your friend would ere this time have been\r\na corpse; one minute more, and the vapour had done its work. Adieu;\r\ngoodnight, and pleasant dreams.”\r\n\r\n“But, my preserver, you will not leave us?” said Glyndon, anxiously, and\r\nspeaking for the first time. “Will you not return with us?”\r\n\r\nZanoni paused, and drew Glyndon aside. “Young man,” said he, gravely,\r\n“it is necessary that we should again meet to-night. It is necessary\r\nthat you should, ere the first hour of morning, decide on your own fate.\r\nI know that you have insulted her whom you profess to love. It is not\r\ntoo late to repent. Consult not your friend: he is sensible and wise;\r\nbut not now is his wisdom needed. There are times in life when, from the\r\nimagination, and not the reason, should wisdom come,--this, for you, is\r\none of them. I ask not your answer now. Collect your thoughts,--recover\r\nyour jaded and scattered spirits. It wants two hours of midnight. Before\r\nmidnight I will be with you.”\r\n\r\n“Incomprehensible being!” replied the Englishman, “I would leave the\r\nlife you have preserved in your own hands; but what I have seen this\r\nnight has swept even Viola from my thoughts. A fiercer desire than that\r\nof love burns in my veins,--the desire not to resemble but to surpass\r\nmy kind; the desire to penetrate and to share the secret of your own\r\nexistence--the desire of a preternatural knowledge and unearthly power.\r\nI make my choice. In my ancestor’s name, I adjure and remind thee of thy\r\npledge. Instruct me; school me; make me thine; and I surrender to thee\r\nat once, and without a murmur, the woman whom, till I saw thee, I would\r\nhave defied a world to obtain.”\r\n\r\n“I bid thee consider well: on the one hand, Viola, a tranquil home, a\r\nhappy and serene life; on the other hand, all is darkness,--darkness,\r\nthat even these eyes cannot penetrate.”\r\n\r\n“But thou hast told me, that if I wed Viola, I must be contented with\r\nthe common existence,--if I refuse, it is to aspire to thy knowledge and\r\nthy power.”\r\n\r\n“Vain man, knowledge and power are not happiness.”\r\n\r\n“But they are better than happiness. Say!--if I marry Viola, wilt thou\r\nbe my master,--my guide? Say this, and I am resolved.\r\n\r\n“It were impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Then I renounce her? I renounce love. I renounce happiness. Welcome\r\nsolitude,--welcome despair; if they are the entrances to thy dark and\r\nsublime secret.”\r\n\r\n“I will not take thy answer now. Before the last hour of night thou\r\nshalt give it in one word,--ay or no! Farewell till then.”\r\n\r\nZanoni waved his hand, and, descending rapidly, was seen no more.\r\n\r\nGlyndon rejoined his impatient and wondering friend; but Mervale, gazing\r\non his face, saw that a great change had passed there. The flexile and\r\ndubious expression of youth was forever gone. The features were locked,\r\nrigid, and stern; and so faded was the natural bloom, that an hour\r\nseemed to have done the work of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.XII.\r\n\r\n     Was ist’s\r\n     Das hinter diesem Schleier sich verbirgt?\r\n     “Das Verschleierte Bild zu Sais.”\r\n\r\n     (What is it that conceals itself behind this veil?)\r\n\r\nOn returning from Vesuvius or Pompeii, you enter Naples through its most\r\nanimated, its most Neapolitan quarter,--through that quarter in which\r\nmodern life most closely resembles the ancient; and in which, when, on\r\na fair-day, the thoroughfare swarms alike with Indolence and Trade, you\r\nare impressed at once with the recollection of that restless, lively\r\nrace from which the population of Naples derives its origin; so that in\r\none day you may see at Pompeii the habitations of a remote age; and on\r\nthe Mole, at Naples, you may imagine you behold the very beings with\r\nwhom those habitations had been peopled.\r\n\r\nBut now, as the Englishmen rode slowly through the deserted streets,\r\nlighted but by the lamps of heaven, all the gayety of day was hushed and\r\nbreathless. Here and there, stretched under a portico or a dingy booth,\r\nwere sleeping groups of houseless Lazzaroni,--a tribe now merging its\r\nindolent individuality amidst an energetic and active population.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman rode on in silence; for Glyndon neither appeared to heed\r\nnor hear the questions and comments of Mervale, and Mervale himself was\r\nalmost as weary as the jaded animal he bestrode.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the silence of earth and ocean was broken by the sound of a\r\ndistant clock that proclaimed the quarter preceding the last hour of\r\nnight. Glyndon started from his reverie, and looked anxiously round. As\r\nthe final stroke died, the noise of hoofs rung on the broad stones of\r\nthe pavement, and from a narrow street to the right emerged the form of\r\na solitary horseman. He neared the Englishmen, and Glyndon recognised\r\nthe features and mien of Zanoni.\r\n\r\n“What! do we meet again, signor?” said Mervale, in a vexed but drowsy\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“Your friend and I have business together,” replied Zanoni, as\r\nhe wheeled his steed to the side of Glyndon. “But it will be soon\r\ntransacted. Perhaps you, sir, will ride on to your hotel.”\r\n\r\n“Alone!”\r\n\r\n“There is no danger!” returned Zanoni, with a slight expression of\r\ndisdain in his voice.\r\n\r\n“None to me; but to Glyndon?”\r\n\r\n“Danger from me! Ah, perhaps you are right.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, my dear Mervale,” said Glyndon; “I will join you before you\r\nreach the hotel.”\r\n\r\nMervale nodded, whistled, and pushed his horse into a kind of amble.\r\n\r\n“Now your answer,--quick?”\r\n\r\n“I have decided. The love of Viola has vanished from my heart. The\r\npursuit is over.”\r\n\r\n“You have decided?”\r\n\r\n“I have; and now my reward.”\r\n\r\n“Thy reward! Well; ere this hour to-morrow it shall await thee.”\r\n\r\nZanoni gave the rein to his horse; it sprang forward with a bound: the\r\nsparks flew from its hoofs, and horse and rider disappeared amidst the\r\nshadows of the street whence they had emerged.\r\n\r\nMervale was surprised to see his friend by his side, a minute after they\r\nhad parted.\r\n\r\n“What has passed between you and Zanoni?”\r\n\r\n“Mervale, do not ask me to-night! I am in a dream.”\r\n\r\n“I do not wonder at it, for even I am in a sleep. Let us push on.”\r\n\r\nIn the retirement of his chamber, Glyndon sought to recollect his\r\nthoughts. He sat down on the foot of his bed, and pressed his hands\r\ntightly to his throbbing temples. The events of the last few hours; the\r\napparition of the gigantic and shadowy Companion of the Mystic, amidst\r\nthe fires and clouds of Vesuvius; the strange encounter with Zanoni\r\nhimself, on a spot in which he could never, by ordinary reasoning, have\r\ncalculated on finding Glyndon, filled his mind with emotions, in which\r\nterror and awe the least prevailed. A fire, the train of which had been\r\nlong laid, was lighted at his heart,--the asbestos-fire that, once lit,\r\nis never to be quenched. All his early aspirations--his young ambition,\r\nhis longings for the laurel--were merged in one passionate yearning to\r\nsurpass the bounds of the common knowledge of man, and reach that solemn\r\nspot, between two worlds, on which the mysterious stranger appeared to\r\nhave fixed his home.\r\n\r\nFar from recalling with renewed affright the remembrance of the\r\napparition that had so appalled him, the recollection only served to\r\nkindle and concentrate his curiosity into a burning focus. He had said\r\naright,--LOVE HAD VANISHED FROM HIS HEART; there was no longer a serene\r\nspace amidst its disordered elements for human affection to move and\r\nbreathe. The enthusiast was rapt from this earth; and he would have\r\nsurrendered all that mortal beauty ever promised, that mortal hope ever\r\nwhispered, for one hour with Zanoni beyond the portals of the visible\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHe rose, oppressed and fevered with the new thoughts that raged within\r\nhim, and threw open his casement for air. The ocean lay suffused in the\r\nstarry light, and the stillness of the heavens never more eloquently\r\npreached the morality of repose to the madness of earthly passions. But\r\nsuch was Glyndon’s mood that their very hush only served to deepen the\r\nwild desires that preyed upon his soul; and the solemn stars, that are\r\nmysteries in themselves, seemed, by a kindred sympathy, to agitate the\r\nwings of the spirit no longer contented with its cage. As he gazed, a\r\nstar shot from its brethren, and vanished from the depth of space!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.XIII.\r\n\r\n     O, be gone!\r\n     By Heaven, I love thee better than myself,\r\n     For I came hither armed against myself.\r\n     --“Romeo and Juliet.”\r\n\r\nThe young actress and Gionetta had returned from the theatre; and Viola\r\nfatigued and exhausted, had thrown herself on a sofa, while Gionetta\r\nbusied herself with the long tresses which, released from the fillet\r\nthat bound them, half-concealed the form of the actress, like a veil of\r\nthreads of gold. As she smoothed the luxuriant locks, the old nurse\r\nran gossiping on about the little events of the night, the scandal and\r\npolitics of the scenes and the tireroom. Gionetta was a worthy soul.\r\nAlmanzor, in Dryden’s tragedy of “Almahide,” did not change sides with\r\nmore gallant indifference than the exemplary nurse. She was at last\r\ngrieved and scandalised that Viola had not selected one chosen cavalier.\r\nBut the choice she left wholly to her fair charge. Zegri or Abencerrage,\r\nGlyndon or Zanoni, it had been the same to her, except that the\r\nrumours she had collected respecting the latter, combined with his\r\nown recommendations of his rival, had given her preference to the\r\nEnglishman. She interpreted ill the impatient and heavy sigh with which\r\nViola greeted her praises of Glyndon, and her wonder that he had of late\r\nso neglected his attentions behind the scenes, and she exhausted all\r\nher powers of panegyric upon the supposed object of the sigh. “And\r\nthen, too,” she said, “if nothing else were to be said against the other\r\nsignor, it is enough that he is about to leave Naples.”\r\n\r\n“Leave Naples!--Zanoni?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, darling! In passing by the Mole to-day, there was a crowd round\r\nsome outlandish-looking sailors. His ship arrived this morning, and\r\nanchors in the bay. The sailors say that they are to be prepared to sail\r\nwith the first wind; they were taking in fresh stores. They--”\r\n\r\n“Leave me, Gionetta! Leave me!”\r\n\r\nThe time had already passed when the girl could confide in Gionetta.\r\nHer thoughts had advanced to that point when the heart recoils from all\r\nconfidence, and feels that it cannot be comprehended. Alone now, in the\r\nprincipal apartment of the house, she paced its narrow boundaries\r\nwith tremulous and agitated steps: she recalled the frightful suit\r\nof Nicot,--the injurious taunt of Glyndon; and she sickened at the\r\nremembrance of the hollow applauses which, bestowed on the actress, not\r\nthe woman, only subjected her to contumely and insult. In that room the\r\nrecollection of her father’s death, the withered laurel and the broken\r\nchords, rose chillingly before her. Hers, she felt, was a yet gloomier\r\nfate,--the chords may break while the laurel is yet green. The lamp,\r\nwaning in its socket, burned pale and dim, and her eyes instinctively\r\nturned from the darker corner of the room. Orphan, by the hearth of thy\r\nparent, dost thou fear the presence of the dead!\r\n\r\nAnd was Zanoni indeed about to quit Naples? Should she see him no\r\nmore? Oh, fool, to think that there was grief in any other thought! The\r\npast!--that was gone! The future!--there was no future to her, Zanoni\r\nabsent! But this was the night of the third day on which Zanoni had told\r\nher that, come what might, he would visit her again. It was, then, if\r\nshe might believe him, some appointed crisis in her fate; and how should\r\nshe tell him of Glyndon’s hateful words? The pure and the proud mind\r\ncan never confide its wrongs to another, only its triumphs and its\r\nhappiness. But at that late hour would Zanoni visit her,--could she\r\nreceive him? Midnight was at hand. Still in undefined suspense, in\r\nintense anxiety, she lingered in the room. The quarter before midnight\r\nsounded, dull and distant. All was still, and she was about to pass to\r\nher sleeping-room, when she heard the hoofs of a horse at full speed;\r\nthe sound ceased, there was a knock at the door. Her heart beat\r\nviolently; but fear gave way to another sentiment when she heard a\r\nvoice, too well known, calling on her name. She paused, and then, with\r\nthe fearlessness of innocence, descended and unbarred the door.\r\n\r\nZanoni entered with a light and hasty step. His horseman’s cloak fitted\r\ntightly to his noble form, and his broad hat threw a gloomy shade over\r\nhis commanding features.\r\n\r\nThe girl followed him into the room she had just left, trembling and\r\nblushing deeply, and stood before him with the lamp she held shining\r\nupward on her cheek and the long hair that fell like a shower of light\r\nover the half-clad shoulders and heaving bust.\r\n\r\n“Viola,” said Zanoni, in a voice that spoke deep emotion, “I am by thy\r\nside once more to save thee. Not a moment is to be lost. Thou must fly\r\nwith me, or remain the victim of the Prince di --. I would have made the\r\ncharge I now undertake another’s; thou knowest I would,--thou knowest\r\nit!--but he is not worthy of thee, the cold Englishman! I throw myself\r\nat thy feet; have trust in me, and fly.”\r\n\r\nHe grasped her hand passionately as he dropped on his knee, and looked\r\nup into her face with his bright, beseeching eyes.\r\n\r\n“Fly with thee!” said Viola, scarce believing her senses.\r\n\r\n“With me. Name, fame, honour,--all will be sacrificed if thou dost not.”\r\n\r\n“Then--then,” said the wild girl, falteringly, and turning aside her\r\nface,--“then I am not indifferent to thee; thou wouldst not give me to\r\nanother?”\r\n\r\nZanoni was silent; but his breast heaved, his cheeks flushed, his eyes\r\ndarted dark and impassioned fire.\r\n\r\n“Speak!” exclaimed Viola, in jealous suspicion of his silence.\r\n\r\n“Indifferent to me! No; but I dare not yet say that I love thee.”\r\n\r\n“Then what matters my fate?” said Viola, turning pale, and shrinking\r\nfrom his side; “leave me,--I fear no danger. My life, and therefore my\r\nhonour, is in mine own hands.”\r\n\r\n“Be not so mad,” said Zanoni. “Hark! do you hear the neigh of my\r\nsteed?--it is an alarm that warns us of the approaching peril. Haste, or\r\nyou are lost!”\r\n\r\n“Why dost thou care for me?” said the girl, bitterly. “Thou hast read my\r\nheart; thou knowest that thou art become the lord of my destiny. But to\r\nbe bound beneath the weight of a cold obligation; to be the beggar on\r\nthe eyes of indifference; to cast myself on one who loves me not,--THAT\r\nwere indeed the vilest sin of my sex. Ah, Zanoni, rather let me die!”\r\n\r\nShe had thrown back her clustering hair from her face while she spoke;\r\nand as she now stood, with her arms drooping mournfully, and her hands\r\nclasped together with the proud bitterness of her wayward spirit, giving\r\nnew zest and charm to her singular beauty, it was impossible to conceive\r\na sight more irresistible to the eye and the heart.\r\n\r\n“Tempt me not to thine own danger,--perhaps destruction!” exclaimed\r\nZanoni, in faltering accents. “Thou canst not dream of what thou wouldst\r\ndemand,--come!” and, advancing, he wound his arm round her waist. “Come,\r\nViola; believe at least in my friendship, my honour, my protection--”\r\n\r\n“And not thy love,” said the Italian, turning on him her reproachful\r\neyes. Those eyes met his, and he could not withdraw from the charm of\r\ntheir gaze. He felt her heart throbbing beneath his own; her breath came\r\nwarm upon his cheek. He trembled,--HE! the lofty, the mysterious Zanoni,\r\nwho seemed to stand aloof from his race. With a deep and burning sigh,\r\nhe murmured, “Viola, I love thee! Oh!” he continued passionately, and,\r\nreleasing his hold, he threw himself abruptly at her feet, “I no more\r\ncommand,--as woman should be wooed, I woo thee. From the first glance of\r\nthose eyes, from the first sound of thy voice, thou becamest too fatally\r\ndear to me. Thou speakest of fascination,--it lives and it breathes\r\nin thee! I fled from Naples to fly from thy presence,--it pursued me.\r\nMonths, years passed, and thy sweet face still shone upon my heart. I\r\nreturned, because I pictured thee alone and sorrowful in the world, and\r\nknew that dangers, from which I might save thee, were gathering\r\nnear thee and around. Beautiful Soul! whose leaves I have read with\r\nreverence, it was for thy sake, thine alone, that I would have given\r\nthee to one who might make thee happier on earth than I can. Viola!\r\nViola! thou knowest not--never canst thou know--how dear thou art to\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nIt is in vain to seek for words to describe the delight--the proud, the\r\nfull, the complete, and the entire delight--that filled the heart of the\r\nNeapolitan. He whom she had considered too lofty even for love,--more\r\nhumble to her than those she had half-despised! She was silent, but her\r\neyes spoke to him; and then slowly, as aware, at last, that the human\r\nlove had advanced on the ideal, she shrank into the terrors of a modest\r\nand virtuous nature. She did not dare,--she did not dream to ask him the\r\nquestion she had so fearlessly made to Glyndon; but she felt a sudden\r\ncoldness,--a sense that a barrier was yet between love and love. “Oh,\r\nZanoni!” she murmured, with downcast eyes, “ask me not to fly with\r\nthee; tempt me not to my shame. Thou wouldst protect me from others. Oh,\r\nprotect me from thyself!”\r\n\r\n“Poor orphan!” said he, tenderly, “and canst thou think that I ask from\r\nthee one sacrifice,--still less the greatest that woman can give to\r\nlove? As my wife I woo thee, and by every tie, and by every vow that can\r\nhallow and endear affection. Alas! they have belied love to thee indeed,\r\nif thou dost not know the religion that belongs to it! They who truly\r\nlove would seek, for the treasure they obtain, every bond that can make\r\nit lasting and secure. Viola, weep not, unless thou givest me the holy\r\nright to kiss away thy tears!”\r\n\r\nAnd that beautiful face, no more averted, drooped upon his bosom; and\r\nas he bent down, his lips sought the rosy mouth: a long and burning\r\nkiss,--danger, life, the world was forgotten! Suddenly Zanoni tore\r\nhimself from her.\r\n\r\n“Hearest thou the wind that sighs, and dies away? As that wind, my power\r\nto preserve thee, to guard thee, to foresee the storm in thy skies, is\r\ngone. No matter. Haste, haste; and may love supply the loss of all that\r\nit has dared to sacrifice! Come.”\r\n\r\nViola hesitated no more. She threw her mantle over her shoulders, and\r\ngathered up her dishevelled hair; a moment, and she was prepared, when a\r\nsudden crash was heard below.\r\n\r\n“Too late!--fool that I was, too late!” cried Zanoni, in a sharp tone of\r\nagony, as he hurried to the door. He opened it, only to be borne back by\r\nthe press of armed men. The room literally swarmed with the followers of\r\nthe ravisher, masked, and armed to the teeth.\r\n\r\nViola was already in the grasp of two of the myrmidons. Her shriek smote\r\nthe ear of Zanoni. He sprang forward; and Viola heard his wild cry in\r\na foreign tongue. She saw the blades of the ruffians pointed at his\r\nbreast! She lost her senses; and when she recovered, she found herself\r\ngagged, and in a carriage that was driven rapidly, by the side of a\r\nmasked and motionless figure. The carriage stopped at the portals of a\r\ngloomy mansion. The gates opened noiselessly; a broad flight of steps,\r\nbrilliantly illumined, was before her. She was in the palace of the\r\nPrince di --.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.XIV.\r\n\r\n     Ma lasciamo, per Dio, Signore, ormai\r\n     Di parlar d’ ira, e di cantar di morte.\r\n     “Orlando Furioso,” Canto xvii. xvii.\r\n\r\n     (But leave me, I solemnly conjure thee, signor, to speak of\r\n     wrath, and to sing of death.)\r\n\r\nThe young actress was led to, and left alone in a chamber adorned with\r\nall the luxurious and half-Eastern taste that at one time characterised\r\nthe palaces of the great seigneurs of Italy. Her first thought was for\r\nZanoni. Was he yet living? Had he escaped unscathed the blades of the\r\nfoe,--her new treasure, the new light of her life, her lord, at last her\r\nlover?\r\n\r\nShe had short time for reflection. She heard steps approaching the\r\nchamber; she drew back, but trembled not. A courage not of herself,\r\nnever known before, sparkled in her eyes, and dilated her stature.\r\nLiving or dead, she would be faithful still to Zanoni! There was a new\r\nmotive to the preservation of honour. The door opened, and the prince\r\nentered in the gorgeous and gaudy custume still worn at that time in\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\n“Fair and cruel one,” said he, advancing with a half-sneer upon his lip,\r\n“thou wilt not too harshly blame the violence of love.” He attempted to\r\ntake her hand as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said he, as she recoiled, “reflect that thou art now in the power\r\nof one that never faltered in the pursuit of an object less dear to him\r\nthan thou art. Thy lover, presumptuous though he be, is not by to save\r\nthee. Mine thou art; but instead of thy master, suffer me to be thy\r\nslave.”\r\n\r\n“Prince,” said Viola, with a stern gravity, “your boast is in vain. Your\r\npower! I am NOT in your power. Life and death are in my own hands. I\r\nwill not defy; but I do not fear you. I feel--and in some feelings,”\r\n added Viola, with a solemnity almost thrilling, “there is all the\r\nstrength, and all the divinity of knowledge--I feel that I am safe even\r\nhere; but you--you, Prince di --, have brought danger to your home and\r\nhearth!”\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan seemed startled by an earnestness and boldness he was but\r\nlittle prepared for. He was not, however, a man easily intimidated or\r\ndeterred from any purpose he had formed; and, approaching Viola, he\r\nwas about to reply with much warmth, real or affected, when a knock\r\nwas heard at the door of the chamber. The sound was repeated, and\r\nthe prince, chafed at the interruption, opened the door and demanded\r\nimpatiently who had ventured to disobey his orders, and invade his\r\nleisure. Mascari presented himself, pale and agitated: “My lord,” said\r\nhe, in a whisper, “pardon me; but a stranger is below, who insists on\r\nseeing you; and, from some words he let fall, I judged it advisable even\r\nto infringe your commands.”\r\n\r\n“A stranger!--and at this hour! What business can he pretend? Why was he\r\neven admitted?”\r\n\r\n“He asserts that your life is in imminent danger. The source whence it\r\nproceeds he will relate to your Excellency alone.”\r\n\r\nThe prince frowned; but his colour changed. He mused a moment, and then,\r\nre-entering the chamber and advancing towards Viola, he said,--\r\n\r\n“Believe me, fair creature, I have no wish to take advantage of my\r\npower. I would fain trust alone to the gentler authorities of affection.\r\nHold yourself queen within these walls more absolutely than you have\r\never enacted that part on the stage. To-night, farewell! May your sleep\r\nbe calm, and your dreams propitious to my hopes.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he retired, and in a few moments Viola was surrounded\r\nby officious attendants, whom she at length, with some difficulty,\r\ndismissed; and, refusing to retire to rest, she spent the night in\r\nexamining the chamber, which she found was secured, and in thoughts of\r\nZanoni, in whose power she felt an almost preternatural confidence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the prince descended the stairs and sought the room into which\r\nthe stranger had been shown.\r\n\r\nHe found the visitor wrapped from head to foot in a long robe,\r\nhalf-gown, half-mantle, such as was sometimes worn by ecclesiastics. The\r\nface of this stranger was remarkable. So sunburnt and swarthy were his\r\nhues, that he must, apparently, have derived his origin amongst the\r\nraces of the farthest East. His forehead was lofty, and his eyes so\r\npenetrating yet so calm in their gaze that the prince shrank from them\r\nas we shrink from a questioner who is drawing forth the guiltiest secret\r\nof our hearts.\r\n\r\n“What would you with me?” asked the prince, motioning his visitor to a\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n“Prince of --,” said the stranger, in a voice deep and sweet, but\r\nforeign in its accent,--“son of the most energetic and masculine race\r\nthat ever applied godlike genius to the service of Human Will, with its\r\nwinding wickedness and its stubborn grandeur; descendant of the great\r\nVisconti in whose chronicles lies the history of Italy in her palmy\r\nday, and in whose rise was the development of the mightiest intellect,\r\nripened by the most restless ambition,--I come to gaze upon the last\r\nstar in a darkening firmament. By this hour to-morrow space shall know\r\nit not. Man, unless thy whole nature change, thy days are numbered!”\r\n\r\n“What means this jargon?” said the prince, in visible astonishment and\r\nsecret awe. “Comest thou to menace me in my own halls, or wouldst\r\nthou warn me of a danger? Art thou some itinerant mountebank, or some\r\nunguessed-of friend? Speak out, and plainly. What danger threatens me?”\r\n\r\n“Zanoni and thy ancestor’s sword,” replied the stranger.\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha!” said the prince, laughing scournfully; “I half-suspected thee\r\nfrom the first. Thou art then the accomplice or the tool of that most\r\ndexterous, but, at present, defeated charlatan? And I suppose thou wilt\r\ntell me that if I were to release a certain captive I have made, the\r\ndanger would vanish, and the hand of the dial would be put back?”\r\n\r\n“Judge of me as thou wilt, Prince di --. I confess my knowledge of\r\nZanoni. Thou, too, wilt know his power, but not till it consume thee.\r\nI would save, therefore I warn thee. Dost thou ask me why? I will tell\r\nthee. Canst thou remember to have heard wild tales of thy grandsire;\r\nof his desire for a knowledge that passes that of the schools and\r\ncloisters; of a strange man from the East who was his familiar and\r\nmaster in lore against which the Vatican has, from age to age,\r\nlaunched its mimic thunder? Dost thou call to mind the fortunes of thy\r\nancestor?--how he succeeded in youth to little but a name; how, after a\r\ncareer wild and dissolute as thine, he disappeared from Milan, a pauper,\r\nand a self-exile; how, after years spent, none knew in what climes or\r\nin what pursuits, he again revisited the city where his progenitors had\r\nreigned; how with him came the wise man of the East, the mystic Mejnour;\r\nhow they who beheld him, beheld with amaze and fear that time had\r\nploughed no furrow on his brow; that youth seemed fixed, as by a spell,\r\nupon his face and form? Dost thou not know that from that hour his\r\nfortunes rose? Kinsmen the most remote died; estate upon estate fell\r\ninto the hands of the ruined noble. He became the guide of princes, the\r\nfirst magnate of Italy. He founded anew the house of which thou art the\r\nlast lineal upholder, and transferred his splendour from Milan to the\r\nSicilian realms. Visions of high ambition were then present with him\r\nnightly and daily. Had he lived, Italy would have known a new dynasty,\r\nand the Visconti would have reigned over Magna-Graecia. He was a man\r\nsuch as the world rarely sees; but his ends, too earthly, were at war\r\nwith the means he sought. Had his ambition been more or less, he had\r\nbeen worthy of a realm mightier than the Caesars swayed; worthy of our\r\nsolemn order; worthy of the fellowship of Mejnour, whom you now behold\r\nbefore you.”\r\n\r\nThe prince, who had listened with deep and breathless attention to the\r\nwords of his singular guest, started from his seat at his last words.\r\n“Imposter!” he cried, “can you dare thus to play with my credulity?\r\nSixty years have flown since my grandsire died; were he living, he had\r\npassed his hundred and twentieth year; and you, whose old age is\r\nerect and vigorous, have the assurance to pretend to have been his\r\ncontemporary! But you have imperfectly learned your tale. You know not,\r\nit seems, that my grandsire, wise and illustrious indeed, in all save\r\nhis faith in a charlatan, was found dead in his bed, in the very hour\r\nwhen his colossal plans were ripe for execution, and that Mejnour was\r\nguilty of his murder.”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” answered the stranger, in a voice of great sadness, “had he\r\nbut listened to Mejnour,--had he but delayed the last and most perilous\r\nordeal of daring wisdom until the requisite training and initiation had\r\nbeen completed,--your ancestor would have stood with me upon an\r\neminence which the waters of Death itself wash everlastingly, but cannot\r\noverflow. Your grandsire resisted my fervent prayers, disobeyed my most\r\nabsolute commands, and in the sublime rashness of a soul that panted\r\nfor secrets, which he who desires orbs and sceptres never can obtain,\r\nperished, the victim of his own frenzy.”\r\n\r\n“He was poisoned, and Mejnour fled.”\r\n\r\n“Mejnour fled not,” answered the stranger, proudly--“Mejnour could not\r\nfly from danger; for to him danger is a thing long left behind. It was\r\nthe day before the duke took the fatal draft which he believed was to\r\nconfer on the mortal the immortal boon, that, finding my power over him\r\nwas gone, I abandoned him to his doom. But a truce with this: I loved\r\nyour grandsire! I would save the last of his race. Oppose not thyself\r\nto Zanoni. Yield not thy soul to thine evil passions. Draw back from the\r\nprecipice while there is yet time. In thy front, and in thine eyes, I\r\ndetect some of that diviner glory which belonged to thy race. Thou hast\r\nin thee some germs of their hereditary genius, but they are choked up\r\nby worse than thy hereditary vices. Recollect that by genius thy house\r\nrose; by vice it ever failed to perpetuate its power. In the laws\r\nwhich regulate the universe, it is decreed that nothing wicked can long\r\nendure. Be wise, and let history warn thee. Thou standest on the verge\r\nof two worlds, the past and the future; and voices from either shriek\r\nomen in thy ear. I have done. I bid thee farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Not so; thou shalt not quit these walls. I will make experiment of thy\r\nboasted power. What, ho there!--ho!”\r\n\r\nThe prince shouted; the room was filled with his minions.\r\n\r\n“Seize that man!” he cried, pointing to the spot which had been filled\r\nby the form of Mejnour. To his inconceivable amaze and horror, the spot\r\nwas vacant. The mysterious stranger had vanished like a dream; but a\r\nthin and fragrant mist undulated, in pale volumes, round the walls of\r\nthe chamber. “Look to my lord,” cried Mascari. The prince had fallen to\r\nthe floor insensible. For many hours he seemed in a kind of trance. When\r\nhe recovered, he dismissed his attendants, and his step was heard in his\r\nchamber, pacing to and fro, with heavy and disordered strides. Not till\r\nan hour before his banquet the next day did he seem restored to his\r\nwonted self.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.XV.\r\n\r\n     Oime! come poss’ io\r\n     Altri trovar, se me trovar non posso.\r\n     “Amint.,” At. i. Sc. ii.\r\n\r\n     (Alas! how can I find another when I cannot find myself?)\r\n\r\nThe sleep of Glyndon, the night after his last interview with Zanoni,\r\nwas unusually profound; and the sun streamed full upon his eyes as he\r\nopened them to the day. He rose refreshed, and with a strange sentiment\r\nof calmness that seemed more the result of resolution than exhaustion.\r\nThe incidents and emotions of the past night had settled into distinct\r\nand clear impressions. He thought of them but slightly,--he thought\r\nrather of the future. He was as one of the initiated in the old Egyptian\r\nmysteries who have crossed the gate only to long more ardently for the\r\npenetralia.\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself, and was relieved to find that Mervale had joined a\r\nparty of his countrymen on an excursion to Ischia. He spent the heat of\r\nnoon in thoughtful solitude, and gradually the image of Viola returned\r\nto his heart. It was a holy--for it was a HUMAN--image. He had resigned\r\nher; and though he repented not, he was troubled at the thought that\r\nrepentance would have come too late.\r\n\r\nHe started impatiently from his seat, and strode with rapid steps to the\r\nhumble abode of the actress.\r\n\r\nThe distance was considerable, and the air oppressive. Glyndon arrived\r\nat the door breathless and heated. He knocked; no answer came. He lifted\r\nthe latch and entered. He ascended the stairs; no sound, no sight of\r\nlife met his ear and eye. In the front chamber, on a table, lay the\r\nguitar of the actress, and some manuscript parts in the favourite\r\noperas. He paused, and, summoning courage, tapped at the door which\r\nseemed to lead into the inner apartment. The door was ajar; and, hearing\r\nno sound within, he pushed it open. It was the sleeping-chamber of the\r\nyoung actress, that holiest ground to a lover; and well did the place\r\nbecome the presiding deity: none of the tawdry finery of the profession\r\nwas visible, on the one hand; none of the slovenly disorder common to\r\nthe humbler classes of the South, on the other. All was pure and simple;\r\neven the ornaments were those of an innocent refinement,--a few books,\r\nplaced carefully on shelves, a few half-faded flowers in an earthen\r\nvase, which was modelled and painted in the Etruscan fashion. The\r\nsunlight streamed over the snowy draperies of the bed, and a few\r\narticles of clothing on the chair beside it. Viola was not there; but\r\nthe nurse!--was she gone also? He made the house resound with the name\r\nof Gionetta, but there was not even an echo to reply. At last, as he\r\nreluctantly quitted the desolate abode, he perceived Gionetta coming\r\ntowards him from the street.\r\n\r\nThe poor old woman uttered an exclamation of joy on seeing him; but,\r\nto their mutual disappointment, neither had any cheerful tidings or\r\nsatisfactory explanation to afford the other. Gionetta had been aroused\r\nfrom her slumber the night before by the noise in the rooms below; but\r\nere she could muster courage to descend, Viola was gone! She found the\r\nmarks of violence on the door without; and all she had since been able\r\nto learn in the neighbourhood was, that a Lazzarone, from his nocturnal\r\nresting-place on the Chiaja, had seen by the moonlight a carriage, which\r\nhe recognised as belonging to the Prince di --, pass and repass that\r\nroad about the first hour of morning. Glyndon, on gathering from the\r\nconfused words and broken sobs of the old nurse the heads of this\r\naccount, abruptly left her, and repaired to the palace of Zanoni. There\r\nhe was informed that the signor was gone to the banquet of the Prince\r\ndi --, and would not return till late. Glyndon stood motionless with\r\nperplexity and dismay; he knew not what to believe, or how to act.\r\nEven Mervale was not at hand to advise him. His conscience smote him\r\nbitterly. He had had the power to save the woman he had loved, and had\r\nforegone that power; but how was it that in this Zanoni himself had\r\nfailed? How was it that he was gone to the very banquet of the ravisher?\r\nCould Zanoni be aware of what had passed? If not, should he lose a\r\nmoment in apprising him? Though mentally irresolute, no man was more\r\nphysically brave. He would repair at once to the palace of the prince\r\nhimself; and if Zanoni failed in the trust he had half-appeared to\r\narrogate, he, the humble foreigner, would demand the captive of fraud\r\nand force, in the very halls and before the assembled guests of the\r\nPrince di --.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.XVI.\r\n\r\n     Ardua vallatur duris sapientia scrupis.\r\n     Hadr. Jun., “Emblem.” xxxvii.\r\n\r\n     (Lofty wisdom is circled round with rugged rocks.)\r\n\r\nWe must go back some hours in the progress of this narrative. It was the\r\nfirst faint and gradual break of the summer dawn; and two men stood in\r\na balcony overhanging a garden fragrant with the scents of the awakening\r\nflowers. The stars had not yet left the sky,--the birds were yet silent\r\non the boughs: all was still, hushed, and tranquil; but how different\r\nthe tranquillity of reviving day from the solemn repose of night! In the\r\nmusic of silence there are a thousand variations. These men, who alone\r\nseemed awake in Naples, were Zanoni and the mysterious stranger who\r\nhad but an hour or two ago startled the Prince di -- in his voluptuous\r\npalace.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the latter; “hadst thou delayed the acceptance of the\r\nArch-gift until thou hadst attained to the years, and passed through\r\nall the desolate bereavements that chilled and seared myself ere my\r\nresearches had made it mine, thou wouldst have escaped the curse of\r\nwhich thou complainest now,--thou wouldst not have mourned over the\r\nbrevity of human affection as compared to the duration of thine own\r\nexistence; for thou wouldst have survived the very desire and dream\r\nof the love of woman. Brightest, and, but for that error, perhaps the\r\nloftiest, of the secret and solemn race that fills up the interval in\r\ncreation between mankind and the children of the Empyreal, age after age\r\nwilt thou rue the splendid folly which made thee ask to carry the\r\nbeauty and the passions of youth into the dreary grandeur of earthly\r\nimmortality.”\r\n\r\n“I do not repent, nor shall I,” answered Zanoni. “The transport and the\r\nsorrow, so wildly blended, which have at intervals diversified my doom,\r\nare better than the calm and bloodless tenor of thy solitary way--thou,\r\nwho lovest nothing, hatest nothing, feelest nothing, and walkest the\r\nworld with the noiseless and joyless footsteps of a dream!”\r\n\r\n“You mistake,” replied he who had owned the name of Mejnour,--“though I\r\ncare not for love, and am dead to every PASSION that agitates the sons\r\nof clay, I am not dead to their more serene enjoyments. I carry down the\r\nstream of the countless years, not the turbulent desires of youth,\r\nbut the calm and spiritual delights of age. Wisely and deliberately I\r\nabandoned youth forever when I separated my lot from men. Let us not\r\nenvy or reproach each other. I would have saved this Neapolitan,\r\nZanoni (since so it now pleases thee to be called), partly because\r\nhis grandsire was but divided by the last airy barrier from our own\r\nbrotherhood, partly because I know that in the man himself lurk the\r\nelements of ancestral courage and power, which in earlier life would\r\nhave fitted him for one of us. Earth holds but few to whom Nature has\r\ngiven the qualities that can bear the ordeal. But time and excess,\r\nthat have quickened his grosser senses, have blunted his imagination. I\r\nrelinquish him to his doom.”\r\n\r\n“And still, then, Mejnour, you cherish the desire to revive our\r\norder, limited now to ourselves alone, by new converts and allies.\r\nSurely--surely--thy experience might have taught thee, that scarcely\r\nonce in a thousand years is born the being who can pass through the\r\nhorrible gates that lead into the worlds without! Is not thy path\r\nalready strewed with thy victims? Do not their ghastly faces of agony\r\nand fear--the blood-stained suicide, the raving maniac--rise before\r\nthee, and warn what is yet left to thee of human sympathy from thy\r\ninsane ambition?”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” answered Mejnour; “have I not had success to counterbalance\r\nfailure? And can I forego this lofty and august hope, worthy alone of\r\nour high condition,--the hope to form a mighty and numerous race with\r\na force and power sufficient to permit them to acknowledge to mankind\r\ntheir majestic conquests and dominion, to become the true lords of this\r\nplanet, invaders, perchance, of others, masters of the inimical and\r\nmalignant tribes by which at this moment we are surrounded: a race\r\nthat may proceed, in their deathless destinies, from stage to stage of\r\ncelestial glory, and rank at last amongst the nearest ministrants and\r\nagents gathered round the Throne of Thrones? What matter a thousand\r\nvictims for one convert to our band? And you, Zanoni,” continued\r\nMejnour, after a pause,--“you, even you, should this affection for a\r\nmortal beauty that you have dared, despite yourself, to cherish, be more\r\nthan a passing fancy; should it, once admitted into your inmost nature,\r\npartake of its bright and enduring essence,--even you may brave all\r\nthings to raise the beloved one into your equal. Nay, interrupt me not.\r\nCan you see sickness menace her; danger hover around; years creep on;\r\nthe eyes grow dim; the beauty fade, while the heart, youthful still,\r\nclings and fastens round your own,--can you see this, and know it is\r\nyours to--”\r\n\r\n“Cease!” cried Zanoni, fiercely. “What is all other fate as compared\r\nto the death of terror? What, when the coldest sage, the most heated\r\nenthusiast, the hardiest warrior with his nerves of iron, have been\r\nfound dead in their beds, with straining eyeballs and horrent hair,\r\nat the first step of the Dread Progress,--thinkest thou that this\r\nweak woman--from whose cheek a sound at the window, the screech of the\r\nnight-owl, the sight of a drop of blood on a man’s sword, would start\r\nthe colour--could brave one glance of--Away! the very thought of such\r\nsights for her makes even myself a coward!”\r\n\r\n“When you told her you loved her,--when you clasped her to your breast,\r\nyou renounced all power to foresee her future lot, or protect her from\r\nharm. Henceforth to her you are human, and human only. How know you,\r\nthen, to what you may be tempted; how know you what her curiosity may\r\nlearn and her courage brave? But enough of this,--you are bent on your\r\npursuit?”\r\n\r\n“The fiat has gone forth.”\r\n\r\n“And to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, at this hour, our bark will be bounding over yonder ocean,\r\nand the weight of ages will have fallen from my heart! I compassionate\r\nthee, O foolish sage,--THOU hast given up THY youth!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.XVII.\r\n\r\n     Alch:  Thou always speakest riddles.  Tell me if thou art that\r\n     fountain of which Bernard Lord Trevizan writ?\r\n\r\n     Merc:  I am not that fountain, but I am the water.  The fountain\r\n     compasseth me about.\r\n\r\n     Sandivogius, “New Light of Alchymy.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince di -- was not a man whom Naples could suppose to be addicted\r\nto superstitious fancies. Still, in the South of Italy, there was then,\r\nand there still lingers a certain spirit of credulity, which may, ever\r\nand anon, be visible amidst the boldest dogmas of their philosophers and\r\nsceptics. In his childhood, the prince had learned strange tales of the\r\nambition, the genius, and the career of his grandsire,--and secretly,\r\nperhaps influenced by ancestral example, in earlier youth he himself\r\nhad followed science, not only through her legitimate course, but her\r\nantiquated and erratic windings. I have, indeed, been shown in Naples a\r\nlittle volume, blazoned with the arms of the Visconti, and ascribed\r\nto the nobleman I refer to, which treats of alchemy in a spirit\r\nhalf-mocking and half-reverential.\r\n\r\nPleasure soon distracted him from such speculations, and his talents,\r\nwhich were unquestionably great, were wholly perverted to extravagant\r\nintrigues, or to the embellishment of a gorgeous ostentation with\r\nsomething of classic grace. His immense wealth, his imperious pride,\r\nhis unscrupulous and daring character, made him an object of no\r\ninconsiderable fear to a feeble and timid court; and the ministers of\r\nthe indolent government willingly connived at excesses which allured him\r\nat least from ambition. The strange visit and yet more strange departure\r\nof Mejnour filled the breast of the Neapolitan with awe and wonder,\r\nagainst which all the haughty arrogance and learned scepticism of his\r\nmaturer manhood combated in vain. The apparition of Mejnour served,\r\nindeed, to invest Zanoni with a character in which the prince had not\r\nhitherto regarded him. He felt a strange alarm at the rival he had\r\nbraved,--at the foe he had provoked. When, a little before his banquet,\r\nhe had resumed his self-possession, it was with a fell and gloomy\r\nresolution that he brooded over the perfidious schemes he had previously\r\nformed. He felt as if the death of the mysterious Zanoni were necessary\r\nfor the preservation of his own life; and if at an earlier period of\r\ntheir rivalry he had determined on the fate of Zanoni, the warnings of\r\nMejnour only served to confirm his resolve.\r\n\r\n“We will try if his magic can invent an antidote to the bane,” said\r\nhe, half-aloud, and with a stern smile, as he summoned Mascari to his\r\npresence. The poison which the prince, with his own hands, mixed into\r\nthe wine intended for his guest, was compounded from materials, the\r\nsecret of which had been one of the proudest heir-looms of that able\r\nand evil race which gave to Italy her wisest and guiltiest tyrants. Its\r\noperation was quick yet not sudden: it produced no pain,--it left on\r\nthe form no grim convulsion, on the skin no purpling spot, to arouse\r\nsuspicion; you might have cut and carved every membrane and fibre of the\r\ncorpse, but the sharpest eyes of the leech would not have detected the\r\npresence of the subtle life-queller. For twelve hours the victim felt\r\nnothing save a joyous and elated exhilaration of the blood; a delicious\r\nlanguor followed, the sure forerunner of apoplexy. No lancet then\r\ncould save! Apoplexy had run much in the families of the enemies of the\r\nVisconti!\r\n\r\nThe hour of the feast arrived,--the guests assembled. There were the\r\nflower of the Neapolitan seignorie, the descendants of the Norman, the\r\nTeuton, the Goth; for Naples had then a nobility, but derived it from\r\nthe North, which has indeed been the Nutrix Leonum,--the nurse of the\r\nlion-hearted chivalry of the world.\r\n\r\nLast of the guests came Zanoni; and the crowd gave way as the dazzling\r\nforeigner moved along to the lord of the palace. The prince greeted him\r\nwith a meaning smile, to which Zanoni answered by a whisper, “He who\r\nplays with loaded dice does not always win.”\r\n\r\nThe prince bit his lip, and Zanoni, passing on, seemed deep in\r\nconversation with the fawning Mascari.\r\n\r\n“Who is the prince’s heir?” asked the guest.\r\n\r\n“A distant relation on the mother’s side; with his Excellency dies the\r\nmale line.”\r\n\r\n“Is the heir present at our host’s banquet?”\r\n\r\n“No; they are not friends.”\r\n\r\n“No matter; he will be here to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nMascari stared in surprise; but the signal for the banquet was given,\r\nand the guests were marshalled to the board. As was the custom then, the\r\nfeast took place not long after mid-day. It was a long, oval hall, the\r\nwhole of one side opening by a marble colonnade upon a court or garden,\r\nin which the eye rested gratefully upon cool fountains and statues of\r\nwhitest marble, half-sheltered by orange-trees. Every art that\r\nluxury could invent to give freshness and coolness to the languid and\r\nbreezeless heat of the day without (a day on which the breath of the\r\nsirocco was abroad) had been called into existence. Artificial currents\r\nof air through invisible tubes, silken blinds waving to and fro, as if\r\nto cheat the senses into the belief of an April wind, and miniature jets\r\nd’eau in each corner of the apartment, gave to the Italians the same\r\nsense of exhilaration and COMFORT (if I may use the word) which the\r\nwell-drawn curtains and the blazing hearth afford to the children of\r\ncolder climes.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was somewhat more lively and intellectual than is\r\ncommon amongst the languid pleasure-hunters of the South; for the\r\nprince, himself accomplished, sought his acquaintance not only amongst\r\nthe beaux esprits of his own country, but amongst the gay foreigners who\r\nadorned and relieved the monotony of the Neapolitan circles. There were\r\npresent two or three of the brilliant Frenchmen of the old regime, who\r\nhad already emigrated from the advancing Revolution; and their peculiar\r\nturn of thought and wit was well calculated for the meridian of a\r\nsociety that made the dolce far niente at once its philosophy and its\r\nfaith. The prince, however, was more silent than usual; and when he\r\nsought to rouse himself, his spirits were forced and exaggerated. To the\r\nmanners of his host, those of Zanoni afforded a striking contrast. The\r\nbearing of this singular person was at all times characterised by a calm\r\nand polished ease, which was attributed by the courtiers to the long\r\nhabit of society. He could scarcely be called gay; yet few persons more\r\ntended to animate the general spirits of a convivial circle. He seemed,\r\nby a kind of intuition, to elicit from each companion the qualities in\r\nwhich he most excelled; and if occasionally a certain tone of latent\r\nmockery characterised his remarks upon the topics on which the\r\nconversation fell, it appeared to men who took nothing in earnest to be\r\nthe language both of wit and wisdom. To the Frenchmen, in particular,\r\nthere was something startling in his intimate knowledge of the minutest\r\nevents in their own capital and country, and his profound penetration\r\n(evinced but in epigrams and sarcasms) into the eminent characters who\r\nwere then playing a part upon the great stage of continental intrigue.\r\n\r\nIt was while this conversation grew animated, and the feast was at its\r\nheight, that Glyndon arrived at the palace. The porter, perceiving by\r\nhis dress that he was not one of the invited guests, told him that\r\nhis Excellency was engaged, and on no account could be disturbed;\r\nand Glyndon then, for the first time, became aware how strange and\r\nembarrassing was the duty he had taken on himself. To force an entrance\r\ninto the banquet-hall of a great and powerful noble, surrounded by the\r\nrank of Naples, and to arraign him for what to his boon-companions would\r\nappear but an act of gallantry, was an exploit that could not fail to be\r\nat once ludicrous and impotent. He mused a moment, and, slipping a piece\r\nof gold into the porter’s hand, said that he was commissioned to seek\r\nthe Signor Zanoni upon an errand of life and death, and easily won his\r\nway across the court, and into the interior building. He passed up the\r\nbroad staircase, and the voices and merriment of the revellers smote\r\nhis ear at a distance. At the entrance of the reception-rooms he found\r\na page, whom he despatched with a message to Zanoni. The page did the\r\nerrand; and Zanoni, on hearing the whispered name of Glyndon, turned to\r\nhis host.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, my lord; an English friend of mine, the Signor Glyndon (not\r\nunknown by name to your Excellency) waits without,--the business must\r\nindeed be urgent on which he has sought me in such an hour. You will\r\nforgive my momentary absence.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, signor,” answered the prince, courteously, but with a sinister\r\nsmile on his countenance, “would it not be better for your friend\r\nto join us? An Englishman is welcome everywhere; and even were he a\r\nDutchman, your friendship would invest his presence with attraction.\r\nPray his attendance; we would not spare you even for a moment.”\r\n\r\nZanoni bowed; the page was despatched with all flattering messages\r\nto Glyndon,--a seat next to Zanoni was placed for him, and the young\r\nEnglishman entered.\r\n\r\n“You are most welcome, sir. I trust your business to our illustrious\r\nguest is of good omen and pleasant import. If you bring evil news, defer\r\nit, I pray you.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon’s brow was sullen; and he was about to startle the guests by\r\nhis reply, when Zanoni, touching his arm significantly, whispered in\r\nEnglish, “I know why you have sought me. Be silent, and witness what\r\nensues.”\r\n\r\n“You know then that Viola, whom you boasted you had the power to save\r\nfrom danger--”\r\n\r\n“Is in this house!--yes. I know also that Murder sits at the right hand\r\nof our host. But his fate is now separated from hers forever; and the\r\nmirror which glasses it to my eye is clear through the streams of blood.\r\nBe still, and learn the fate that awaits the wicked!\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Zanoni, speaking aloud, “the Signor Glyndon has indeed\r\nbrought me tidings not wholly unexpected. I am compelled to leave\r\nNaples,--an additional motive to make the most of the present hour.”\r\n\r\n“And what, if I may venture to ask, may be the cause that brings such\r\naffliction on the fair dames of Naples?”\r\n\r\n“It is the approaching death of one who honoured me with most loyal\r\nfriendship,” replied Zanoni, gravely. “Let us not speak of it; grief\r\ncannot put back the dial. As we supply by new flowers those that fade\r\nin our vases, so it is the secret of worldly wisdom to replace by fresh\r\nfriendships those that fade from our path.”\r\n\r\n“True philosophy!” exclaimed the prince. “‘Not to admire,’ was the\r\nRoman’s maxim; ‘Never to mourn,’ is mine. There is nothing in life to\r\ngrieve for, save, indeed, Signor Zanoni, when some young beauty, on whom\r\nwe have set our hearts, slips from our grasp. In such a moment we have\r\nneed of all our wisdom, not to succumb to despair, and shake hands with\r\ndeath. What say you, signor? You smile! Such never could be your lot.\r\nPledge me in a sentiment, ‘Long life to the fortunate lover,--a quick\r\nrelease to the baffled suitor’?”\r\n\r\n“I pledge you,” said Zanoni; and, as the fatal wine was poured into his\r\nglass, he repeated, fixing his eyes on the prince, “I pledge you even in\r\nthis wine!”\r\n\r\nHe lifted the glass to his lips. The prince seemed ghastly pale,\r\nwhile the gaze of his guest bent upon him, with an intent and stern\r\nbrightness, beneath which the conscience-stricken host cowered and\r\nquailed. Not till he had drained his draft, and replaced the glass upon\r\nthe board, did Zanoni turn his eyes from the prince; and he then said,\r\n“Your wine has been kept too long; it has lost its virtues. It might\r\ndisagree with many, but do not fear: it will not harm me, prince, Signor\r\nMascari, you are a judge of the grape; will you favour us with your\r\nopinion?”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” answered Mascari, with well-affected composure, “I like not the\r\nwines of Cyprus; they are heating. Perhaps Signor Glyndon may not have\r\nthe same distaste? The English are said to love their potations warm and\r\npungent.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish my friend also to taste the wine, prince?” said Zanoni.\r\n“Recollect, all cannot drink it with the same impunity as myself.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the prince, hastily; “if you do not recommend the wine,\r\nHeaven forbid that we should constrain our guests! My lord duke,”\r\n turning to one of the Frenchmen, “yours is the true soil of Bacchus.\r\nWhat think you of this cask from Burgundy? Has it borne the journey?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Zanoni, “let us change both the wine and the theme.”\r\n\r\nWith that, Zanoni grew yet more animated and brilliant. Never did wit\r\nmore sparkling, airy, exhilarating, flash from the lips of reveller.\r\nHis spirits fascinated all present--even the prince himself, even\r\nGlyndon--with a strange and wild contagion. The former, indeed, whom the\r\nwords and gaze of Zanoni, when he drained the poison, had filled with\r\nfearful misgivings, now hailed in the brilliant eloquence of his wit a\r\ncertain sign of the operation of the bane. The wine circulated fast; but\r\nnone seemed conscious of its effects. One by one the rest of the party\r\nfell into a charmed and spellbound silence, as Zanoni continued to pour\r\nforth sally upon sally, tale upon tale. They hung on his words, they\r\nalmost held their breath to listen. Yet, how bitter was his mirth; how\r\nfull of contempt for the triflers present, and for the trifles which\r\nmade their life!\r\n\r\nNight came on; the room grew dim, and the feast had lasted several hours\r\nlonger than was the customary duration of similar entertainments at\r\nthat day. Still the guests stirred not, and still Zanoni continued, with\r\nglittering eye and mocking lip, to lavish his stores of intellect\r\nand anecdote; when suddenly the moon rose, and shed its rays over the\r\nflowers and fountains in the court without, leaving the room itself half\r\nin shadow, and half tinged by a quiet and ghostly light.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Zanoni rose. “Well, gentlemen,” said he, “we have not\r\nyet wearied our host, I hope; and his garden offers a new temptation to\r\nprotract our stay. Have you no musicians among your train, prince,\r\nthat might regale our ears while we inhale the fragrance of your\r\norange-trees?”\r\n\r\n“An excellent thought!” said the prince. “Mascari, see to the music.”\r\n\r\nThe party rose simultaneously to adjourn to the garden; and then, for\r\nthe first time, the effect of the wine they had drunk seemed to make\r\nitself felt.\r\n\r\nWith flushed cheeks and unsteady steps they came into the open air,\r\nwhich tended yet more to stimulate that glowing fever of the grape.\r\nAs if to make up for the silence with which the guests had hitherto\r\nlistened to Zanoni, every tongue was now loosened,--every man talked,\r\nno man listened. There was something wild and fearful in the contrast\r\nbetween the calm beauty of the night and scene, and the hubbub and\r\nclamour of these disorderly roysters. One of the Frenchmen, in especial,\r\nthe young Duc de R--, a nobleman of the highest rank, and of all the\r\nquick, vivacious, and irascible temperament of his countrymen, was\r\nparticularly noisy and excited. And as circumstances, the remembrance\r\nof which is still preserved among certain circles of Naples, rendered it\r\nafterwards necessary that the duc should himself give evidence of what\r\noccurred, I will here translate the short account he drew up, and which\r\nwas kindly submitted to me some few years ago by my accomplished and\r\nlively friend, Il Cavaliere di B--.\r\n\r\n“I never remember,” writes the duc, “to have felt my spirits so excited\r\nas on that evening; we were like so many boys released from school,\r\njostling each other as we reeled or ran down the flight of seven\r\nor eight stairs that led from the colonnade into the garden,--some\r\nlaughing, some whooping, some scolding, some babbling. The wine had\r\nbrought out, as it were, each man’s inmost character. Some were loud and\r\nquarrelsome, others sentimental and whining; some, whom we had hitherto\r\nthought dull, most mirthful; some, whom we had ever regarded as discreet\r\nand taciturn, most garrulous and uproarious. I remember that in the\r\nmidst of our clamorous gayety, my eye fell upon the cavalier Signor\r\nZanoni, whose conversation had so enchanted us all; and I felt a\r\ncertain chill come over me to perceive that he wore the same calm and\r\nunsympathising smile upon his countenance which had characterised it\r\nin his singular and curious stories of the court of Louis XIV. I felt,\r\nindeed, half-inclined to seek a quarrel with one whose composure\r\nwas almost an insult to our disorder. Nor was such an effect of this\r\nirritating and mocking tranquillity confined to myself alone. Several of\r\nthe party have told me since, that on looking at Zanoni they felt their\r\nblood yet more heated, and gayety change to resentment. There seemed in\r\nhis icy smile a very charm to wound vanity and provoke rage. It was at\r\nthis moment that the prince came up to me, and, passing his arm into\r\nmine, led me a little apart from the rest. He had certainly indulged in\r\nthe same excess as ourselves, but it did not produce the same effect of\r\nnoisy excitement. There was, on the contrary, a certain cold arrogance\r\nand supercilious scorn in his bearing and language, which, even while\r\naffecting so much caressing courtesy towards me, roused my self-love\r\nagainst him. He seemed as if Zanoni had infected him; and in imitating\r\nthe manner of his guest, he surpassed the original. He rallied me on\r\nsome court gossip, which had honoured my name by associating it with a\r\ncertain beautiful and distinguished Sicilian lady, and affected to treat\r\nwith contempt that which, had it been true, I should have regarded as a\r\nboast. He spoke, indeed, as if he himself had gathered all the flowers\r\nof Naples, and left us foreigners only the gleanings he had scorned.\r\nAt this my natural and national gallantry was piqued, and I retorted\r\nby some sarcasms that I should certainly have spared had my blood been\r\ncooler. He laughed heartily, and left me in a strange fit of resentment\r\nand anger. Perhaps (I must own the truth) the wine had produced in me a\r\nwild disposition to take offence and provoke quarrel. As the prince left\r\nme, I turned, and saw Zanoni at my side.\r\n\r\n“‘The prince is a braggart,’ said he, with the same smile that\r\ndispleased me before. ‘He would monopolize all fortune and all love. Let\r\nus take our revenge.’\r\n\r\n“‘And how?’\r\n\r\n“‘He has at this moment, in his house, the most enchanting singer in\r\nNaples,--the celebrated Viola Pisani. She is here, it is true, not by\r\nher own choice; he carried her hither by force, but he will pretend that\r\nshe adores him. Let us insist on his producing this secret treasure, and\r\nwhen she enters, the Duc de R-- can have no doubt that his flatteries\r\nand attentions will charm the lady, and provoke all the jealous fears of\r\nour host. It would be a fair revenge upon his imperious self-conceit.’\r\n\r\n“This suggestion delighted me. I hastened to the prince. At that instant\r\nthe musicians had just commenced; I waved my hand, ordered the music to\r\nstop, and, addressing the prince, who was standing in the centre of one\r\nof the gayest groups, complained of his want of hospitality in affording\r\nto us such poor proficients in the art, while he reserved for his own\r\nsolace the lute and voice of the first performer in Naples. I demanded,\r\nhalf-laughingly, half-seriously, that he should produce the Pisani. My\r\ndemand was received with shouts of applause by the rest. We drowned the\r\nreplies of our host with uproar, and would hear no denial. ‘Gentlemen,’\r\nat last said the prince, when he could obtain an audience, ‘even were\r\nI to assent to your proposal, I could not induce the signora to present\r\nherself before an assemblage as riotous as they are noble. You have too\r\nmuch chivalry to use compulsion with her, though the Duc de R--forgets\r\nhimself sufficiently to administer it to me.’\r\n\r\n“I was stung by this taunt, however well deserved. ‘Prince,’ said I, ‘I\r\nhave for the indelicacy of compulsion so illustrious an example that I\r\ncannot hesitate to pursue the path honoured by your own footsteps. All\r\nNaples knows that the Pisani despises at once your gold and your love;\r\nthat force alone could have brought her under your roof; and that you\r\nrefuse to produce her, because you fear her complaints, and know enough\r\nof the chivalry your vanity sneers at to feel assured that the gentlemen\r\nof France are not more disposed to worship beauty than to defend it from\r\nwrong.’\r\n\r\n“‘You speak well, sir,’ said Zanoni, gravely. ‘The prince dares not\r\nproduce his prize!’\r\n\r\n“The prince remained speechless for a few moments, as if with\r\nindignation. At last he broke out into expressions the most injurious\r\nand insulting against Signor Zanoni and myself. Zanoni replied not; I\r\nwas more hot and hasty. The guests appeared to delight in our dispute.\r\nNone, except Mascari, whom we pushed aside and disdained to hear, strove\r\nto conciliate; some took one side, some another. The issue may be well\r\nforeseen. Swords were called for and procured. Two were offered me by\r\none of the party. I was about to choose one, when Zanoni placed in\r\nmy hand the other, which, from its hilt, appeared of antiquated\r\nworkmanship. At the same moment, looking towards the prince, he said,\r\nsmilingly, ‘The duc takes your grandsire’s sword. Prince, you are too\r\nbrave a man for superstition; you have forgot the forfeit!’ Our host\r\nseemed to me to recoil and turn pale at those words; nevertheless, he\r\nreturned Zanoni’s smile with a look of defiance. The next moment all was\r\nbroil and disorder. There might be some six or eight persons engaged\r\nin a strange and confused kind of melee, but the prince and myself only\r\nsought each other. The noise around us, the confusion of the guests,\r\nthe cries of the musicians, the clash of our own swords, only served\r\nto stimulate our unhappy fury. We feared to be interrupted by the\r\nattendants, and fought like madmen, without skill or method. I thrust\r\nand parried mechanically, blind and frantic, as if a demon had entered\r\ninto me, till I saw the prince stretched at my feet, bathed in his\r\nblood, and Zanoni bending over him, and whispering in his ear. That\r\nsight cooled us all. The strife ceased; we gathered, in shame, remorse,\r\nand horror, round our ill-fated host; but it was too late,--his eyes\r\nrolled fearfully in his head. I have seen many men die, but never one\r\nwho wore such horror on his countenance. At last all was over! Zanoni\r\nrose from the corpse, and, taking, with great composure, the sword from\r\nmy hand, said calmly, ‘Ye are witnesses, gentlemen, that the prince\r\nbrought his fate upon himself. The last of that illustrious house has\r\nperished in a brawl.’\r\n\r\n“I saw no more of Zanoni. I hastened to our envoy to narrate the event,\r\nand abide the issue. I am grateful to the Neapolitan government, and to\r\nthe illustrious heir of the unfortunate nobleman, for the lenient and\r\ngenerous, yet just, interpretation put upon a misfortune the memory of\r\nwhich will afflict me to the last hour of my life.\r\n\r\n(Signed) “Louis Victor, Duc de R.”\r\n\r\nIn the above memorial, the reader will find the most exact and minute\r\naccount yet given of an event which created the most lively sensation at\r\nNaples in that day.\r\n\r\nGlyndon had taken no part in the affray, neither had he participated\r\nlargely in the excesses of the revel. For his exemption from both he was\r\nperhaps indebted to the whispered exhortations of Zanoni. When the last\r\nrose from the corpse, and withdrew from that scene of confusion, Glyndon\r\nremarked that in passing the crowd he touched Mascari on the shoulder,\r\nand said something which the Englishman did not overhear. Glyndon\r\nfollowed Zanoni into the banquet-room, which, save where the moonlight\r\nslept on the marble floor, was wrapped in the sad and gloomy shadows of\r\nthe advancing night.\r\n\r\n“How could you foretell this fearful event? He fell not by your arm!”\r\n said Glyndon, in a tremulous and hollow tone.\r\n\r\n“The general who calculates on the victory does not fight in person,”\r\n answered Zanoni; “let the past sleep with the dead. Meet me at midnight\r\nby the sea-shore, half a mile to the left of your hotel. You will know\r\nthe spot by a rude pillar--the only one near--to which a broken chain\r\nis attached. There and then, if thou wouldst learn our lore, thou shalt\r\nfind the master. Go; I have business here yet. Remember, Viola is still\r\nin the house of the dead man!”\r\n\r\nHere Mascari approached, and Zanoni, turning to the Italian, and waving\r\nhis hand to Glyndon, drew the former aside. Glyndon slowly departed.\r\n\r\n“Mascari,” said Zanoni, “your patron is no more; your services will\r\nbe valueless to his heir,--a sober man whom poverty has preserved\r\nfrom vice. For yourself, thank me that I do not give you up to the\r\nexecutioner; recollect the wine of Cyprus. Well, never tremble, man; it\r\ncould not act on me, though it might react on others; in that it is a\r\ncommon type of crime. I forgive you; and if the wine should kill me,\r\nI promise you that my ghost shall not haunt so worshipful a penitent.\r\nEnough of this; conduct me to the chamber of Viola Pisani. You have\r\nno further need of her. The death of the jailer opens the cell of the\r\ncaptive. Be quick; I would be gone.”\r\n\r\nMascari muttered some inaudible words, bowed low, and led the way to the\r\nchamber in which Viola was confined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.XVIII.\r\n\r\n     Merc:  Tell me, therefore, what thou seekest after, and what thou\r\n     wilt have.  What dost thou desire to make?\r\n\r\n     Alch:  The Philosopher’s Stone.\r\n\r\n     Sandivogius.\r\n\r\nIt wanted several minutes of midnight, and Glyndon repaired to the\r\nappointed spot. The mysterious empire which Zanoni had acquired over\r\nhim, was still more solemnly confirmed by the events of the last few\r\nhours; the sudden fate of the prince, so deliberately foreshadowed, and\r\nyet so seemingly accidental, brought out by causes the most commonplace,\r\nand yet associated with words the most prophetic, impressed him with\r\nthe deepest sentiments of admiration and awe. It was as if this dark and\r\nwondrous being could convert the most ordinary events and the meanest\r\ninstruments into the agencies of his inscrutable will; yet, if so, why\r\nhave permitted the capture of Viola? Why not have prevented the crime\r\nrather than punish the criminal? And did Zanoni really feel love for\r\nViola? Love, and yet offer to resign her to himself,--to a rival whom\r\nhis arts could not have failed to baffle. He no longer reverted to the\r\nbelief that Zanoni or Viola had sought to dupe him into marriage. His\r\nfear and reverence for the former now forbade the notion of so poor an\r\nimposture. Did he any longer love Viola himself? No; when that morning\r\nhe had heard of her danger, he had, it is true, returned to the\r\nsympathies and the fears of affection; but with the death of the prince\r\nher image faded from his heart, and he felt no jealous pang at the\r\nthought that she had been saved by Zanoni,--that at that moment she\r\nwas perhaps beneath his roof. Whoever has, in the course of his life,\r\nindulged the absorbing passion of the gamester, will remember how all\r\nother pursuits and objects vanished from his mind; how solely he was\r\nwrapped in the one wild delusion; with what a sceptre of magic power\r\nthe despot-demon ruled every feeling and every thought. Far more intense\r\nthan the passion of the gamester was the frantic yet sublime desire that\r\nmastered the breast of Glyndon. He would be the rival of Zanoni, not in\r\nhuman and perishable affections, but in preternatural and eternal lore.\r\nHe would have laid down life with content--nay, rapture--as the price of\r\nlearning those solemn secrets which separated the stranger from mankind.\r\nEnamoured of the goddess of goddesses, he stretched forth his arms--the\r\nwild Ixion--and embraced a cloud!\r\n\r\nThe night was most lovely and serene, and the waves scarcely rippled at\r\nhis feet as the Englishman glided on by the cool and starry beach. At\r\nlength he arrived at the spot, and there, leaning against the broken\r\npillar, he beheld a man wrapped in a long mantle, and in an attitude\r\nof profound repose. He approached, and uttered the name of Zanoni. The\r\nfigure turned, and he saw the face of a stranger: a face not stamped by\r\nthe glorious beauty of Zanoni, but equally majestic in its aspect, and\r\nperhaps still more impressive from the mature age and the passionless\r\ndepth of thought that characterised the expanded forehead, and deep-set\r\nbut piercing eyes.\r\n\r\n“You seek Zanoni,” said the stranger; “he will be here anon; but,\r\nperhaps, he whom you see before you is more connected with your destiny,\r\nand more disposed to realise your dreams.”\r\n\r\n“Hath the earth, then, another Zanoni?”\r\n\r\n“If not,” replied the stranger, “why do you cherish the hope and the\r\nwild faith to be yourself a Zanoni? Think you that none others\r\nhave burned with the same godlike dream? Who, indeed in his first\r\nyouth,--youth when the soul is nearer to the heaven from which it\r\nsprang, and its divine and primal longings are not all effaced by the\r\nsordid passions and petty cares that are begot in time,--who is there\r\nin youth that has not nourished the belief that the universe has\r\nsecrets not known to the common herd, and panted, as the hart for the\r\nwater-springs, for the fountains that lie hid and far away amidst the\r\nbroad wilderness of trackless science? The music of the fountain is\r\nheard in the soul WITHIN, till the steps, deceived and erring, rove away\r\nfrom its waters, and the wanderer dies in the mighty desert. Think you\r\nthat none who have cherished the hope have found the truth, or that the\r\nyearning after the Ineffable Knowledge was given to us utterly in vain?\r\nNo! Every desire in human hearts is but a glimpse of things that exist,\r\nalike distant and divine. No! in the world there have been from age to\r\nage some brighter and happier spirits who have attained to the air in\r\nwhich the beings above mankind move and breathe. Zanoni, great though\r\nhe be, stands not alone. He has had his predecessors, and long lines of\r\nsuccessors may be yet to come.”\r\n\r\n“And will you tell me,” said Glyndon, “that in yourself I behold one\r\nof that mighty few over whom Zanoni has no superiority in power and\r\nwisdom?”\r\n\r\n“In me,” answered the stranger, “you see one from whom Zanoni himself\r\nlearned some of his loftiest secrets. On these shores, on this spot,\r\nhave I stood in ages that your chroniclers but feebly reach. The\r\nPhoenician, the Greek, the Oscan, the Roman, the Lombard, I have seen\r\nthem all!--leaves gay and glittering on the trunk of the universal life,\r\nscattered in due season and again renewed; till, indeed, the same race\r\nthat gave its glory to the ancient world bestowed a second youth upon\r\nthe new. For the pure Greeks, the Hellenes, whose origin has bewildered\r\nyour dreaming scholars, were of the same great family as the Norman\r\ntribe, born to be the lords of the universe, and in no land on earth\r\ndestined to become the hewers of wood. Even the dim traditions of the\r\nlearned, which bring the sons of Hellas from the vast and undetermined\r\nterritories of Northern Thrace, to be the victors of the pastoral\r\nPelasgi, and the founders of the line of demi-gods; which assign to a\r\npopulation bronzed beneath the suns of the West, the blue-eyed Minerva\r\nand the yellow-haired Achilles (physical characteristics of the North);\r\nwhich introduce, amongst a pastoral people, warlike aristocracies and\r\nlimited monarchies, the feudalism of the classic time,--even these might\r\nserve you to trace back the primeval settlements of the Hellenes to the\r\nsame region whence, in later times, the Norman warriors broke on\r\nthe dull and savage hordes of the Celt, and became the Greeks of the\r\nChristian world. But this interests you not, and you are wise in\r\nyour indifference. Not in the knowledge of things without, but in the\r\nperfection of the soul within, lies the empire of man aspiring to be\r\nmore than man.”\r\n\r\n“And what books contain that science; from what laboratory is it\r\nwrought?”\r\n\r\n“Nature supplies the materials; they are around you in your daily walks.\r\nIn the herbs that the beast devours and the chemist disdains to cull; in\r\nthe elements from which matter in its meanest and its mightiest shapes\r\nis deduced; in the wide bosom of the air; in the black abysses of the\r\nearth; everywhere are given to mortals the resources and libraries\r\nof immortal lore. But as the simplest problems in the simplest of\r\nall studies are obscure to one who braces not his mind to their\r\ncomprehension; as the rower in yonder vessel cannot tell you why two\r\ncircles can touch each other only in one point,--so though all earth\r\nwere carved over and inscribed with the letters of diviner knowledge,\r\nthe characters would be valueless to him who does not pause to inquire\r\nthe language and meditate the truth. Young man, if thy imagination is\r\nvivid, if thy heart is daring, if thy curiosity is insatiate, I will\r\naccept thee as my pupil. But the first lessons are stern and dread.”\r\n\r\n“If thou hast mastered them, why not I?” answered Glyndon, boldly. “I\r\nhave felt from my boyhood that strange mysteries were reserved for my\r\ncareer; and from the proudest ends of ordinary ambition I have carried\r\nmy gaze into the cloud and darkness that stretch beyond. The instant I\r\nbeheld Zanoni, I felt as if I had discovered the guide and the tutor for\r\nwhich my youth had idly languished and vainly burned.”\r\n\r\n“And to me his duty is transferred,” replied the stranger. “Yonder lies,\r\nanchored in the bay, the vessel in which Zanoni seeks a fairer home;\r\na little while and the breeze will rise, the sail will swell; and the\r\nstranger will have passed, like a wind, away. Still, like the wind, he\r\nleaves in thy heart the seeds that may bear the blossom and the fruit.\r\nZanoni hath performed his task,--he is wanted no more; the perfecter of\r\nhis work is at thy side. He comes! I hear the dash of the oar. You will\r\nhave your choice submitted to you. According as you decide we shall meet\r\nagain.” With these words the stranger moved slowly away, and disappeared\r\nbeneath the shadow of the cliffs. A boat glided rapidly across the\r\nwaters: it touched land; a man leaped on shore, and Glyndon recognised\r\nZanoni.\r\n\r\n“I give thee, Glyndon,--I give thee no more the option of happy love and\r\nserene enjoyment. That hour is past, and fate has linked the hand that\r\nmight have been thine own to mine. But I have ample gifts to bestow\r\nupon thee, if thou wilt abandon the hope that gnaws thy heart, and the\r\nrealisation of which even _I_ have not the power to foresee. Be thine\r\nambition human, and I can gratify it to the full. Men desire four things\r\nin life,--love, wealth, fame, power. The first I cannot give thee, the\r\nrest are at my disposal. Select which of them thou wilt, and let us part\r\nin peace.”\r\n\r\n“Such are not the gifts I covet. I choose knowledge; that knowledge must\r\nbe thine own. For this, and for this alone, I surrendered the love of\r\nViola; this, and this alone, must be my recompense.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot gain say thee, though I can warn. The desire to learn does not\r\nalways contain the faculty to acquire. I can give thee, it is true, the\r\nteacher,--the rest must depend on thee. Be wise in time, and take that\r\nwhich I can assure to thee.”\r\n\r\n“Answer me but these questions, and according to your answer I will\r\ndecide. Is it in the power of man to attain intercourse with the beings\r\nof other worlds? Is it in the power of man to influence the elements,\r\nand to insure life against the sword and against disease?”\r\n\r\n“All this may be possible,” answered Zanoni, evasively, “to the few; but\r\nfor one who attains such secrets, millions may perish in the attempt.”\r\n\r\n“One question more. Thou--”\r\n\r\n“Beware! Of myself, as I have said before, I render no account.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, the stranger I have met this night,--are his boasts to be\r\nbelieved? Is he in truth one of the chosen seers whom you allow to have\r\nmastered the mysteries I yearn to fathom?”\r\n\r\n“Rash man,” said Zanoni, in a tone of compassion, “thy crisis is past,\r\nand thy choice made! I can only bid thee be bold and prosper; yes, I\r\nresign thee to a master who HAS the power and the will to open to thee\r\nthe gates of an awful world. Thy weal or woe are as nought in the eyes\r\nof his relentless wisdom. I would bid him spare thee, but he will heed\r\nme not. Mejnour, receive thy pupil!” Glyndon turned, and his heart beat\r\nwhen he perceived that the stranger, whose footsteps he had not heard\r\nupon the pebbles, whose approach he had not beheld in the moonlight, was\r\nonce more by his side.\r\n\r\n“Farewell,” resumed Zanoni; “thy trial commences. When next we meet,\r\nthou wilt be the victim or the victor.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon’s eyes followed the receding form of the mysterious stranger.\r\nHe saw him enter the boat, and he then for the first time noticed that\r\nbesides the rowers there was a female, who stood up as Zanoni gained the\r\nboat. Even at the distance he recognised the once-adored form of Viola.\r\nShe waved her hand to him, and across the still and shining air came\r\nher voice, mournfully and sweetly, in her mother’s tongue, “Farewell,\r\nClarence,--I forgive thee!--farewell, farewell!”\r\n\r\nHe strove to answer; but the voice touched a chord at his heart, and\r\nthe words failed him. Viola was then lost forever, gone with this dread\r\nstranger; darkness was round her lot! And he himself had decided her\r\nfate and his own! The boat bounded on, the soft waves flashed and\r\nsparkled beneath the oars, and it was along one sapphire track of\r\nmoonlight that the frail vessel bore away the lovers. Farther and\r\nfarther from his gaze sped the boat, till at last the speck, scarcely\r\nvisible, touched the side of the ship that lay lifeless in the glorious\r\nbay. At that instant, as if by magic, up sprang, with a glad murmur, the\r\nplayful and freshening wind: and Glyndon turned to Mejnour and broke the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“Tell me--if thou canst read the future--tell me that HER lot will be\r\nfair, and that HER choice at least is wise?”\r\n\r\n“My pupil!” answered Mejnour, in a voice the calmness of which well\r\naccorded with the chilling words, “thy first task must be to withdraw\r\nall thought, feeling, sympathy from others. The elementary stage of\r\nknowledge is to make self, and self alone, thy study and thy world.\r\nThou hast decided thine own career; thou hast renounced love; thou hast\r\nrejected wealth, fame, and the vulgar pomps of power. What, then, are\r\nall mankind to thee? To perfect thy faculties, and concentrate thy\r\nemotions, is henceforth thy only aim!”\r\n\r\n“And will happiness be the end?”\r\n\r\n“If happiness exist,” answered Mejnour, “it must be centred in a SELF to\r\nwhich all passion is unknown. But happiness is the last state of being;\r\nand as yet thou art on the threshold of the first.”\r\n\r\nAs Mejnour spoke, the distant vessel spread its sails to the wind,\r\nand moved slowly along the deep. Glyndon sighed, and the pupil and the\r\nmaster retraced their steps towards the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV. -- THE DWELLER OF THE THRESHOLD.\r\n\r\n     Bey hinter ihm was will! Ich heb ihn auf.\r\n     “Das Verschleierte Bildzu Sais”\r\n\r\n     (Be behind what there may,--I raise the veil.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.I.\r\n\r\n     Come vittima io vengo all’ ara.\r\n     “Metast.,” At. ii. Sc. 7.\r\n\r\n     (As a victim I go to the altar.)\r\n\r\nIt was about a month after the date of Zanoni’s departure and Glyndon’s\r\nintroduction to Mejnour, when two Englishmen were walking, arm-in-arm,\r\nthrough the Toledo.\r\n\r\n“I tell you,” said one (who spoke warmly), “that if you have a particle\r\nof common-sense left in you, you will accompany me to England. This\r\nMejnour is an imposter more dangerous, because more in earnest, than\r\nZanoni. After all, what do his promises amount to? You allow that\r\nnothing can be more equivocal. You say that he has left Naples,--that he\r\nhas selected a retreat more congenial than the crowded thoroughfares of\r\nmen to the studies in which he is to initiate you; and this retreat is\r\namong the haunts of the fiercest bandits of Italy,--haunts which justice\r\nitself dares not penetrate. Fitting hermitage for a sage! I tremble for\r\nyou. What if this stranger--of whom nothing is known--be leagued with\r\nthe robbers; and these lures for your credulity bait but the traps\r\nfor your property,--perhaps your life? You might come off cheaply by\r\na ransom of half your fortune. You smile indignantly! Well, put\r\ncommon-sense out of the question; take your own view of the matter.\r\nYou are to undergo an ordeal which Mejnour himself does not profess to\r\ndescribe as a very tempting one. It may, or it may not, succeed: if it\r\ndoes not, you are menaced with the darkest evils; and if it does, you\r\ncannot be better off than the dull and joyless mystic whom you have\r\ntaken for a master. Away with this folly; enjoy youth while it is left\r\nto you; return with me to England; forget these dreams; enter your\r\nproper career; form affections more respectable than those which lured\r\nyou awhile to an Italian adventuress. Attend to your fortune, make\r\nmoney, and become a happy and distinguished man. This is the advice of\r\nsober friendship; yet the promises I hold out to you are fairer than\r\nthose of Mejnour.”\r\n\r\n“Mervale,” said Glyndon, doggedly, “I cannot, if I would, yield to\r\nyour wishes. A power that is above me urges me on; I cannot resist\r\nits influence. I will proceed to the last in the strange career I have\r\ncommenced. Think of me no more. Follow yourself the advice you give to\r\nme, and be happy.”\r\n\r\n“This is madness,” said Mervale; “your health is already failing; you\r\nare so changed I should scarcely know you. Come; I have already had your\r\nname entered in my passport; in another hour I shall be gone, and you,\r\nboy that you are, will be left, without a friend, to the deceits of your\r\nown fancy and the machinations of this relentless mountebank.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said Glyndon, coldly; “you cease to be an effective counsellor\r\nwhen you suffer your prejudices to be thus evident. I have already had\r\nample proof,” added the Englishman, and his pale cheek grew more pale,\r\n“of the power of this man,--if man he be, which I sometimes doubt,--and,\r\ncome life, come death, I will not shrink from the paths that allure me.\r\nFarewell, Mervale; if we never meet again,--if you hear, amidst our old\r\nand cheerful haunts, that Clarence Glyndon sleeps the last sleep by the\r\nshores of Naples, or amidst yon distant hills, say to the friends of\r\nour youth, ‘He died worthily, as thousands of martyr-students have died\r\nbefore him, in the pursuit of knowledge.’”\r\n\r\nHe wrung Mervale’s hand as he spoke, darted from his side, and\r\ndisappeared amidst the crowd.\r\n\r\nBy the corner of the Toledo he was arrested by Nicot.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Glyndon! I have not seen you this month. Where have you hid\r\nyourself? Have you been absorbed in your studies?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I am about to leave Naples for Paris. Will you accompany me? Talent of\r\nall order is eagerly sought for there, and will be sure to rise.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you; I have other schemes for the present.”\r\n\r\n“So laconic!--what ails you? Do you grieve for the loss of the\r\nPisani? Take example by me. I have already consoled myself with Bianca\r\nSacchini,--a handsome woman, enlightened, no prejudices. A valuable\r\ncreature I shall find her, no doubt. But as for this Zanoni!”\r\n\r\n“What of him?”\r\n\r\n“If ever I paint an allegorical subject, I will take his likeness as\r\nSatan. Ha, ha! a true painter’s revenge,--eh? And the way of the world,\r\ntoo! When we can do nothing else against a man whom we hate, we can at\r\nleast paint his effigies as the Devil’s. Seriously, though: I abhor that\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“Wherefore?’\r\n\r\n“Wherefore! Has he not carried off the wife and the dowry I had marked\r\nfor myself! Yet, after all,” added Nicot, musingly, “had he served\r\ninstead of injured me, I should have hated him all the same. His very\r\nform, and his very face, made me at once envy and detest him. I felt\r\nthat there is something antipathetic in our natures. I feel, too, that\r\nwe shall meet again, when Jean Nicot’s hate may be less impotent. We,\r\ntoo, cher confrere,--we, too, may meet again! Vive la Republique! I to\r\nmy new world!”\r\n\r\n“And I to mine. Farewell!”\r\n\r\nThat day Mervale left Naples; the next morning Glyndon also quitted\r\nthe City of Delight alone, and on horseback. He bent his way into those\r\npicturesque but dangerous parts of the country which at that time were\r\ninfested by banditti, and which few travellers dared to pass, even in\r\nbroad daylight, without a strong escort. A road more lonely cannot well\r\nbe conceived than that on which the hoofs of his steed, striking upon\r\nthe fragments of rock that encumbered the neglected way, woke a dull\r\nand melancholy echo. Large tracts of waste land, varied by the rank and\r\nprofuse foliage of the South, lay before him; occasionally a wild goat\r\npeeped down from some rocky crag, or the discordant cry of a bird of\r\nprey, startled in its sombre haunt, was heard above the hills. These\r\nwere the only signs of life; not a human being was met,--not a hut was\r\nvisible. Wrapped in his own ardent and solemn thoughts, the young man\r\ncontinued his way, till the sun had spent its noonday heat, and a breeze\r\nthat announced the approach of eve sprung up from the unseen ocean\r\nwhich lay far distant to his right. It was then that a turn in the road\r\nbrought before him one of those long, desolate, gloomy villages which\r\nare found in the interior of the Neapolitan dominions: and now he came\r\nupon a small chapel on one side the road, with a gaudily painted image\r\nof the Virgin in the open shrine. Around this spot, which, in the heart\r\nof a Christian land, retained the vestige of the old idolatry (for\r\njust such were the chapels that in the pagan age were dedicated to the\r\ndemon-saints of mythology), gathered six or seven miserable and squalid\r\nwretches, whom the curse of the leper had cut off from mankind. They\r\nset up a shrill cry as they turned their ghastly visages towards the\r\nhorseman; and, without stirring from the spot, stretched out their gaunt\r\narms, and implored charity in the name of the Merciful Mother! Glyndon\r\nhastily threw them some small coins, and, turning away his face, clapped\r\nspurs to his horse, and relaxed not his speed till he entered the\r\nvillage. On either side the narrow and miry street, fierce and haggard\r\nforms--some leaning against the ruined walls of blackened huts, some\r\nseated at the threshold, some lying at full length in the mud--presented\r\ngroups that at once invoked pity and aroused alarm: pity for their\r\nsqualor, alarm for the ferocity imprinted on their savage aspects. They\r\ngazed at him, grim and sullen, as he rode slowly up the rugged street;\r\nsometimes whispering significantly to each other, but without attempting\r\nto stop his way. Even the children hushed their babble, and ragged\r\nurchins, devouring him with sparkling eyes, muttered to their mothers;\r\n“We shall feast well to-morrow!” It was, indeed, one of those hamlets\r\nin which Law sets not its sober step, in which Violence and Murder house\r\nsecure,--hamlets common then in the wilder parts of Italy, in which the\r\npeasant was but the gentler name for the robber.\r\n\r\nGlyndon’s heart somewhat failed him as he looked around, and the\r\nquestion he desired to ask died upon his lips. At length from one of\r\nthe dismal cabins emerged a form superior to the rest. Instead of the\r\npatched and ragged over-all, which made the only garment of the men he\r\nhad hitherto seen, the dress of this person was characterised by all the\r\ntrappings of the national bravery. Upon his raven hair, the glossy curls\r\nof which made a notable contrast to the matted and elfin locks of the\r\nsavages around, was placed a cloth cap, with a gold tassel that hung\r\ndown to his shoulder; his mustaches were trimmed with care, and a silk\r\nkerchief of gay hues was twisted round a well-shaped but sinewy throat;\r\na short jacket of rough cloth was decorated with several rows of gilt\r\nfilagree buttons; his nether garments fitted tight to his limbs, and\r\nwere curiously braided; while in a broad parti-coloured sash were placed\r\ntwo silver-hilted pistols, and the sheathed knife, usually worn by\r\nItalians of the lower order, mounted in ivory elaborately carved. A\r\nsmall carbine of handsome workmanship was slung across his shoulder and\r\ncompleted his costume. The man himself was of middle size, athletic yet\r\nslender, with straight and regular features, sunburnt, but not swarthy;\r\nand an expression of countenance which, though reckless and bold, had in\r\nit frankness rather than ferocity, and, if defying, was not altogether\r\nunprepossessing.\r\n\r\nGlyndon, after eyeing this figure for some moments with great attention,\r\nchecked his rein, and asked the way to the “Castle of the Mountain.”\r\n\r\nThe man lifted his cap as he heard the question, and, approaching\r\nGlyndon, laid his hand upon the neck of the horse, and said, in a low\r\nvoice, “Then you are the cavalier whom our patron the signor expected.\r\nHe bade me wait for you here, and lead you to the castle. And indeed,\r\nsignor, it might have been unfortunate if I had neglected to obey the\r\ncommand.”\r\n\r\nThe man then, drawing a little aside, called out to the bystanders in a\r\nloud voice, “Ho, ho! my friends, pay henceforth and forever all respect\r\nto this worshipful cavalier. He is the expected guest of our blessed\r\npatron of the Castle of the Mountain. Long life to him! May he, like his\r\nhost, be safe by day and by night; on the hill and in the waste; against\r\nthe dagger and the bullet,--in limb and in life! Cursed be he who\r\ntouches a hair of his head, or a baioccho in his pouch. Now and forever\r\nwe will protect and honour him,--for the law or against the law; with\r\nthe faith and to the death. Amen! Amen!”\r\n\r\n“Amen!” responded, in wild chorus, a hundred voices; and the scattered\r\nand straggling groups pressed up the street, nearer and nearer to the\r\nhorseman.\r\n\r\n“And that he may be known,” continued the Englishman’s strange\r\nprotector, “to the eye and to the ear, I place around him the white\r\nsash, and I give him the sacred watchword, ‘Peace to the Brave.’ Signor,\r\nwhen you wear this sash, the proudest in these parts will bare the head\r\nand bend the knee. Signor, when you utter this watchword, the bravest\r\nhearts will be bound to your bidding. Desire you safety, or ask you\r\nrevenge--to gain a beauty, or to lose a foe,--speak but the word, and we\r\nare yours: we are yours! Is it not so, comrades?”\r\n\r\nAnd again the hoarse voices shouted, “Amen, Amen!”\r\n\r\n“Now, signor,” whispered the bravo, “if you have a few coins to spare,\r\nscatter them amongst the crowd, and let us be gone.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon, not displeased at the concluding sentence, emptied his purse\r\nin the streets; and while, with mingled oaths, blessings, shrieks, and\r\nyells, men, women, and children scrambled for the money, the bravo,\r\ntaking the rein of the horse, led it a few paces through the village at\r\na brisk trot, and then, turning up a narrow lane to the left, in a few\r\nminutes neither houses nor men were visible, and the mountains closed\r\ntheir path on either side. It was then that, releasing the bridle and\r\nslackening his pace, the guide turned his dark eyes on Glyndon with an\r\narch expression, and said,--\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency was not, perhaps, prepared for the hearty welcome we\r\nhave given you.”\r\n\r\n“Why, in truth, I OUGHT to have been prepared for it, since the signor,\r\nto whose house I am bound, did not disguise from me the character of the\r\nneighbourhood. And your name, my friend, if I may so call you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no ceremonies with me, Excellency. In the village I am generally\r\ncalled Maestro Paolo. I had a surname once, though a very equivocal one;\r\nand I have forgotten THAT since I retired from the world.”\r\n\r\n“And was it from disgust, from poverty, or from some--some ebullition\r\nof passion which entailed punishment, that you betook yourself to the\r\nmountains?”\r\n\r\n“Why, signor,” said the bravo, with a gay laugh, “hermits of my class\r\nseldom love the confessional. However, I have no secrets while my step\r\nis in these defiles, my whistle in my pouch, and my carbine at my back.”\r\n With that the robber, as if he loved permission to talk at his\r\nwill, hemmed thrice, and began with much humour; though, as his tale\r\nproceeded, the memories it roused seemed to carry him farther than he\r\nat first intended, and reckless and light-hearted ease gave way to\r\nthat fierce and varied play of countenance and passion of gesture which\r\ncharacterise the emotions of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n“I was born at Terracina,--a fair spot, is it not? My father was a\r\nlearned monk of high birth; my mother--Heaven rest her!--an innkeeper’s\r\npretty daughter. Of course there could be no marriage in the case;\r\nand when I was born, the monk gravely declared my appearance to be\r\nmiraculous. I was dedicated from my cradle to the altar; and my head was\r\nuniversally declared to be the orthodox shape for a cowl. As I grew up,\r\nthe monk took great pains with my education; and I learned Latin and\r\npsalmody as soon as less miraculous infants learn crowing. Nor did the\r\nholy man’s care stint itself to my interior accomplishments. Although\r\nvowed to poverty, he always contrived that my mother should have\r\nher pockets full; and between her pockets and mine there was soon\r\nestablished a clandestine communication; accordingly, at fourteen,\r\nI wore my cap on one side, stuck pistols in my belt, and assumed the\r\nswagger of a cavalier and a gallant. At that age my poor mother died;\r\nand about the same period my father, having written a History of the\r\nPontifical Bulls, in forty volumes, and being, as I said, of high birth,\r\nobtained a cardinal’s hat. From that time he thought fit to disown your\r\nhumble servant. He bound me over to an honest notary at Naples, and gave\r\nme two hundred crowns by way of provision. Well, signor, I saw enough of\r\nthe law to convince me that I should never be rogue enough to shine in\r\nthe profession. So, instead of spoiling parchment, I made love to the\r\nnotary’s daughter. My master discovered our innocent amusement, and\r\nturned me out of doors; that was disagreeable. But my Ninetta loved\r\nme, and took care that I should not lie out in the streets with the\r\nLazzaroni. Little jade! I think I see her now with her bare feet, and\r\nher finger to her lips, opening the door in the summer nights, and\r\nbidding me creep softly into the kitchen, where, praised be the saints!\r\na flask and a manchet always awaited the hungry amoroso. At last,\r\nhowever, Ninetta grew cold. It is the way of the sex, signor. Her\r\nfather found her an excellent marriage in the person of a withered old\r\npicture-dealer. She took the spouse, and very properly clapped the door\r\nin the face of the lover. I was not disheartened, Excellency; no, not I.\r\nWomen are plentiful while we are young. So, without a ducat in my pocket\r\nor a crust for my teeth, I set out to seek my fortune on board of a\r\nSpanish merchantman. That was duller work than I expected; but luckily\r\nwe were attacked by a pirate,--half the crew were butchered, the\r\nrest captured. I was one of the last: always in luck, you see,\r\nsignor,--monks’ sons have a knack that way! The captain of the pirates\r\ntook a fancy to me. ‘Serve with us?’ said he. ‘Too happy,’ said I.\r\nBehold me, then, a pirate! O jolly life! how I blessed the old notary\r\nfor turning me out of doors! What feasting, what fighting, what wooing,\r\nwhat quarrelling! Sometimes we ran ashore and enjoyed ourselves like\r\nprinces; sometimes we lay in a calm for days together on the loveliest\r\nsea that man ever traversed. And then, if the breeze rose and a sail\r\ncame in sight, who so merry as we? I passed three years in that charming\r\nprofession, and then, signor, I grew ambitious. I caballed against the\r\ncaptain; I wanted his post. One still night we struck the blow. The ship\r\nwas like a log in the sea, no land to be seen from the mast-head, the\r\nwaves like glass, and the moon at its full. Up we rose, thirty of us and\r\nmore. Up we rose with a shout; we poured into the captain’s cabin, I at\r\nthe head. The brave old boy had caught the alarm, and there he stood at\r\nthe doorway, a pistol in each hand; and his one eye (he had only one)\r\nworse to meet than the pistols were.\r\n\r\n“‘Yield!’ cried I; ‘your life shall be safe.’\r\n\r\n“‘Take that,’ said he, and whiz went the pistol; but the saints took\r\ncare of their own, and the ball passed by my cheek, and shot the\r\nboatswain behind me. I closed with the captain, and the other pistol\r\nwent off without mischief in the struggle. Such a fellow he was,--six\r\nfeet four without his shoes! Over we went, rolling each on the other.\r\nSanta Maria! no time to get hold of one’s knife. Meanwhile all the crew\r\nwere up, some for the captain, some for me,--clashing and firing, and\r\nswearing and groaning, and now and then a heavy splash in the sea. Fine\r\nsupper for the sharks that night! At last old Bilboa got uppermost; out\r\nflashed his knife; down it came, but not in my heart. No! I gave my left\r\narm as a shield; and the blade went through to the hilt, with the blood\r\nspurting up like the rain from a whale’s nostril! With the weight of the\r\nblow the stout fellow came down so that his face touched mine; with\r\nmy right hand I caught him by the throat, turned him over like a lamb,\r\nsignor, and faith it was soon all up with him: the boatswain’s brother,\r\na fat Dutchman, ran him through with a pike.\r\n\r\n“‘Old fellow,’ said I, as he turned his terrible eye to me, ‘I bear\r\nyou no malice, but we must try to get on in the world, you know.’ The\r\ncaptain grinned and gave up the ghost. I went upon deck,--what a sight!\r\nTwenty bold fellows stark and cold, and the moon sparkling on the\r\npuddles of blood as calmly as if it were water. Well, signor, the\r\nvictory was ours, and the ship mine; I ruled merrily enough for six\r\nmonths. We then attacked a French ship twice our size; what sport it\r\nwas! And we had not had a good fight so long, we were quite like virgins\r\nat it! We got the best of it, and won ship and cargo. They wanted to\r\npistol the captain, but that was against my laws: so we gagged him, for\r\nhe scolded as loud as if we were married to him; left him and the\r\nrest of his crew on board our own vessel, which was terribly battered;\r\nclapped our black flag on the Frenchman’s, and set off merrily, with a\r\nbrisk wind in our favour. But luck deserted us on forsaking our own dear\r\nold ship. A storm came on, a plank struck; several of us escaped in a\r\nboat; we had lots of gold with us, but no water. For two days and two\r\nnights we suffered horribly; but at last we ran ashore near a French\r\nseaport. Our sorry plight moved compassion, and as we had money, we were\r\nnot suspected,--people only suspect the poor. Here we soon recovered\r\nour fatigues, rigged ourselves out gayly, and your humble servant was\r\nconsidered as noble a captain as ever walked deck. But now, alas! my\r\nfate would have it that I should fall in love with a silk-mercer’s\r\ndaughter. Ah, how I loved her!--the pretty Clara! Yes, I loved her\r\nso well that I was seized with horror at my past life! I resolved to\r\nrepent, to marry her, and settle down into an honest man. Accordingly, I\r\nsummoned my messmates, told them my resolution, resigned my command,\r\nand persuaded them to depart. They were good fellows, engaged with a\r\nDutchman, against whom I heard afterwards they made a successful mutiny,\r\nbut I never saw them more. I had two thousand crowns still left; with\r\nthis sum I obtained the consent of the silk-mercer, and it was agreed\r\nthat I should become a partner in the firm. I need not say that no one\r\nsuspected that I had been so great a man, and I passed for a Neapolitan\r\ngoldsmith’s son instead of a cardinal’s. I was very happy then, signor,\r\nvery,--I could not have harmed a fly! Had I married Clara, I had been as\r\ngentle a mercer as ever handled a measure.”\r\n\r\nThe bravo paused a moment, and it was easy to see that he felt more than\r\nhis words and tone betokened. “Well, well, we must not look back at the\r\npast too earnestly,--the sunlight upon it makes one’s eyes water. The\r\nday was fixed for our wedding,--it approached. On the evening before the\r\nappointed day, Clara, her mother, her little sister, and myself, were\r\nwalking by the port; and as we looked on the sea, I was telling them\r\nold gossip-tales of mermaids and sea-serpents, when a red-faced,\r\nbottle-nosed Frenchman clapped himself right before me, and, placing his\r\nspectacles very deliberately astride his proboscis, echoed out, ‘Sacre,\r\nmille tonnerres! this is the damned pirate who boarded the “Niobe”!’”\r\n\r\n“‘None of your jests,’ said I, mildly. ‘Ho, ho!’ said he; ‘I can’t be\r\nmistaken; help there!’ and he griped me by the collar. I replied, as\r\nyou may suppose, by laying him in the kennel; but it would not do. The\r\nFrench captain had a French lieutenant at his back, whose memory was as\r\ngood as his chief’s. A crowd assembled; other sailors came up: the\r\nodds were against me. I slept that night in prison; and in a few weeks\r\nafterwards I was sent to the galleys. They spared my life, because the\r\nold Frenchman politely averred that I had made my crew spare his. You\r\nmay believe that the oar and the chain were not to my taste. I and two\r\nothers escaped; they took to the road, and have, no doubt, been long\r\nsince broken on the wheel. I, soft soul, would not commit another crime\r\nto gain my bread, for Clara was still at my heart with her sweet eyes;\r\nso, limiting my rogueries to the theft of a beggar’s rags, which I\r\ncompensated by leaving him my galley attire instead, I begged my way\r\nto the town where I left Clara. It was a clear winter’s day when I\r\napproached the outskirts of the town. I had no fear of detection, for my\r\nbeard and hair were as good as a mask. Oh, Mother of Mercy! there came\r\nacross my way a funeral procession! There, now you know it; I can tell\r\nyou no more. She had died, perhaps of love, more likely of shame. Can\r\nyou guess how I spent that night?--I stole a pickaxe from a mason’s\r\nshed, and all alone and unseen, under the frosty heavens, I dug the\r\nfresh mould from the grave; I lifted the coffin, I wrenched the lid, I\r\nsaw her again--again! Decay had not touched her. She was always pale in\r\nlife! I could have sworn she lived! It was a blessed thing to see her\r\nonce more, and all alone too! But then, at dawn, to give her back to the\r\nearth,--to close the lid, to throw down the mould, to hear the pebbles\r\nrattle on the coffin: that was dreadful! Signor, I never knew before,\r\nand I don’t wish to think now, how valuable a thing human life is. At\r\nsunrise I was again a wanderer; but now that Clara was gone, my scruples\r\nvanished, and again I was at war with my betters. I contrived at last,\r\nat O--, to get taken on board a vessel bound to Leghorn, working out my\r\npassage. From Leghorn I went to Rome, and stationed myself at the door\r\nof the cardinal’s palace. Out he came, his gilded coach at the gate.\r\n\r\n“‘Ho, father!’ said I; ‘don’t you know me?’\r\n\r\n“‘Who are you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Your son,’ said I, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“The cardinal drew back, looked at me earnestly, and mused a moment.\r\n‘All men are my sons,’ quoth he then, very mildly; ‘there is gold for\r\nthee! To him who begs once, alms are due; to him who begs twice, jails\r\nare open. Take the hint and molest me no more. Heaven bless thee!’ With\r\nthat he got into his coach, and drove off to the Vatican. His purse\r\nwhich he had left behind was well supplied. I was grateful and\r\ncontented, and took my way to Terracina. I had not long passed the\r\nmarshes when I saw two horsemen approach at a canter.\r\n\r\n“‘You look poor, friend,’ said one of them, halting; ‘yet you are\r\nstrong.’\r\n\r\n“‘Poor men and strong are both serviceable and dangerous, Signor\r\nCavalier.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well said; follow us.’\r\n\r\n“I obeyed, and became a bandit. I rose by degrees; and as I have always\r\nbeen mild in my calling, and have taken purses without cutting throats,\r\nI bear an excellent character, and can eat my macaroni at Naples without\r\nany danger to life and limb. For the last two years I have settled in\r\nthese parts, where I hold sway, and where I have purchased land. I am\r\ncalled a farmer, signor; and I myself now only rob for amusement, and to\r\nkeep my hand in. I trust I have satisfied your curiosity. We are within\r\na hundred yards of the castle.”\r\n\r\n“And how,” asked the Englishman, whose interest had been much excited\r\nby his companion’s narrative,--“and how came you acquainted with my\r\nhost?--and by what means has he so well conciliated the goodwill of\r\nyourself and friends?”\r\n\r\nMaestro Paolo turned his black eyes very gravely towards his questioner.\r\n“Why, signor,” said he, “you must surely know more of the foreign\r\ncavalier with the hard name than I do. All I can say is, that about\r\na fortnight ago I chanced to be standing by a booth in the Toledo at\r\nNaples, when a sober-looking gentleman touched me by the arm, and said,\r\n‘Maestro Paolo, I want to make your acquaintance; do me the favour to\r\ncome into yonder tavern, and drink a flask of lacrima.’ ‘Willingly,’\r\nsaid I. So we entered the tavern. When we were seated, my new\r\nacquaintance thus accosted me: ‘The Count d’O-- has offered to let me\r\nhire his old castle near B--. You know the spot?’\r\n\r\n“‘Extremely well; no one has inhabited it for a century at least; it\r\nis half in ruins, signor. A queer place to hire; I hope the rent is not\r\nheavy.’\r\n\r\n“‘Maestro Paolo,’ said he, ‘I am a philosopher, and don’t care for\r\nluxuries. I want a quiet retreat for some scientific experiments.\r\nThe castle will suit me very well, provided you will accept me as a\r\nneighbour, and place me and my friends under your special protection.\r\nI am rich; but I shall take nothing to the castle worth robbing. I will\r\npay one rent to the count, and another to you.’\r\n\r\n“With that we soon came to terms; and as the strange signor doubled the\r\nsum I myself proposed, he is in high favour with all his neighbours. We\r\nwould guard the whole castle against an army. And now, signor, that I\r\nhave been thus frank, be frank with me. Who is this singular cavalier?”\r\n\r\n“Who?--he himself told you, a philosopher.”\r\n\r\n“Hem! searching for the Philosopher’s Stone,--eh, a bit of a magician;\r\nafraid of the priests?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely; you have hit it.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so; and you are his pupil?”\r\n\r\n“I am.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you well through it,” said the robber, seriously, and crossing\r\nhimself with much devotion; “I am not much better than other people,\r\nbut one’s soul is one’s soul. I do not mind a little honest robbery, or\r\nknocking a man on the head if need be,--but to make a bargain with the\r\ndevil! Ah, take care, young gentleman, take care!”\r\n\r\n“You need not fear,” said Glyndon, smiling; “my preceptor is too wise\r\nand too good for such a compact. But here we are, I suppose. A noble\r\nruin,--a glorious prospect!”\r\n\r\nGlyndon paused delightedly, and surveyed the scene before and below with\r\nthe eye of a painter. Insensibly, while listening to the bandit, he had\r\nwound up a considerable ascent, and now he was upon a broad ledge of\r\nrock covered with mosses and dwarf shrubs. Between this eminence and\r\nanother of equal height, upon which the castle was built, there was a\r\ndeep but narrow fissure, overgrown with the most profuse foliage, so\r\nthat the eye could not penetrate many yards below the rugged surface of\r\nthe abyss; but the profoundness might be well conjectured by the\r\nhoarse, low, monotonous roar of waters unseen that rolled below, and the\r\nsubsequent course of which was visible at a distance in a perturbed and\r\nrapid stream that intersected the waste and desolate valleys.\r\n\r\nTo the left, the prospect seemed almost boundless,--the extreme\r\nclearness of the purple air serving to render distinct the features of\r\na range of country that a conqueror of old might have deemed in itself\r\na kingdom. Lonely and desolate as the road which Glyndon had passed that\r\nday had appeared, the landscape now seemed studded with castles, spires,\r\nand villages. Afar off, Naples gleamed whitely in the last rays of the\r\nsun, and the rose-tints of the horizon melted into the azure of her\r\nglorious bay. Yet more remote, and in another part of the prospect,\r\nmight be caught, dim and shadowy, and backed by the darkest foliage,\r\nthe ruined pillars of the ancient Posidonia. There, in the midst of his\r\nblackened and sterile realms, rose the dismal Mount of Fire; while on\r\nthe other hand, winding through variegated plains, to which distance\r\nlent all its magic, glittered many and many a stream by which Etruscan\r\nand Sybarite, Roman and Saracen and Norman had, at intervals of ages,\r\npitched the invading tent. All the visions of the past--the stormy and\r\ndazzling histories of Southern Italy--rushed over the artist’s mind as\r\nhe gazed below. And then, slowly turning to look behind, he saw the grey\r\nand mouldering walls of the castle in which he sought the secrets that\r\nwere to give to hope in the future a mightier empire than memory owns in\r\nthe past. It was one of those baronial fortresses with which Italy was\r\nstudded in the earlier middle ages, having but little of the Gothic\r\ngrace or grandeur which belongs to the ecclesiastical architecture of\r\nthe same time, but rude, vast, and menacing, even in decay. A wooden\r\nbridge was thrown over the chasm, wide enough to admit two horsemen\r\nabreast; and the planks trembled and gave back a hollow sound as Glyndon\r\nurged his jaded steed across.\r\n\r\nA road which had once been broad and paved with rough flags, but which\r\nnow was half-obliterated by long grass and rank weeds, conducted to the\r\nouter court of the castle hard by; the gates were open, and half the\r\nbuilding in this part was dismantled; the ruins partially hid by ivy\r\nthat was the growth of centuries. But on entering the inner court,\r\nGlyndon was not sorry to notice that there was less appearance of\r\nneglect and decay; some wild roses gave a smile to the grey walls, and\r\nin the centre there was a fountain in which the waters still trickled\r\ncoolly, and with a pleasing murmur, from the jaws of a gigantic Triton.\r\nHere he was met by Mejnour with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Welcome, my friend and pupil,” said he: “he who seeks for Truth can\r\nfind in these solitudes an immortal Academe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.II.\r\n\r\n     And Abaris, so far from esteeming Pythagoras, who taught these\r\n     things, a necromancer or wizard, rather revered and admired him\r\n     as something divine.--Iamblich., “Vit. Pythag.”\r\n\r\nThe attendants whom Mejnour had engaged for his strange abode were such\r\nas might suit a philosopher of few wants. An old Armenian whom Glyndon\r\nrecognised as in the mystic’s service at Naples, a tall, hard-featured\r\nwoman from the village, recommended by Maestro Paolo, and two\r\nlong-haired, smooth-spoken, but fierce-visaged youths from the\r\nsame place, and honoured by the same sponsorship, constituted\r\nthe establishment. The rooms used by the sage were commodious and\r\nweather-proof, with some remains of ancient splendour in the faded\r\narras that clothed the walls, and the huge tables of costly marble and\r\nelaborate carving. Glyndon’s sleeping apartment communicated with a kind\r\nof belvedere, or terrace, that commanded prospects of unrivalled beauty\r\nand extent, and was separated on the other side by a long gallery, and\r\na flight of ten or a dozen stairs, from the private chambers of the\r\nmystic. There was about the whole place a sombre and yet not displeasing\r\ndepth of repose. It suited well with the studies to which it was now to\r\nbe appropriated.\r\n\r\nFor several days Mejnour refused to confer with Glyndon on the subjects\r\nnearest to his heart.\r\n\r\n“All without,” said he, “is prepared, but not all within; your own\r\nsoul must grow accustomed to the spot, and filled with the surrounding\r\nnature; for Nature is the source of all inspiration.”\r\n\r\nWith these words Mejnour turned to lighter topics. He made the\r\nEnglishman accompany him in long rambles through the wild scenes\r\naround, and he smiled approvingly when the young artist gave way to the\r\nenthusiasm which their fearful beauty could not have failed to rouse in\r\na duller breast; and then Mejnour poured forth to his wondering pupil\r\nthe stores of a knowledge that seemed inexhaustible and boundless. He\r\ngave accounts the most curious, graphic, and minute of the various races\r\n(their characters, habits, creeds, and manners) by which that fair land\r\nhad been successively overrun. It is true that his descriptions could\r\nnot be found in books, and were unsupported by learned authorities; but\r\nhe possessed the true charm of the tale-teller, and spoke of all with\r\nthe animated confidence of a personal witness. Sometimes, too, he would\r\nconverse upon the more durable and the loftier mysteries of Nature with\r\nan eloquence and a research which invested them with all the colours\r\nrather of poetry than science. Insensibly the young artist found himself\r\nelevated and soothed by the lore of his companion; the fever of his wild\r\ndesires was slaked. His mind became more and more lulled into the divine\r\ntranquillity of contemplation; he felt himself a nobler being, and in\r\nthe silence of his senses he imagined that he heard the voice of his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nIt was to this state that Mejnour evidently sought to bring the\r\nneophyte, and in this elementary initiation the mystic was like every\r\nmore ordinary sage. For he who seeks to DISCOVER must first reduce\r\nhimself into a kind of abstract idealism, and be rendered up, in solemn\r\nand sweet bondage, to the faculties which CONTEMPLATE and IMAGINE.\r\n\r\nGlyndon noticed that, in their rambles, Mejnour often paused, where the\r\nfoliage was rifest, to gather some herb or flower; and this reminded him\r\nthat he had seen Zanoni similarly occupied. “Can these humble children\r\nof Nature,” said he one day to Mejnour,--“things that bloom and wither\r\nin a day, be serviceable to the science of the higher secrets? Is there\r\na pharmacy for the soul as well as the body, and do the nurslings of the\r\nsummer minister not only to human health but spiritual immortality?”\r\n\r\n“If,” answered Mejnour, “a stranger had visited a wandering tribe before\r\none property of herbalism was known to them; if he had told the savages\r\nthat the herbs which every day they trampled under foot were endowed\r\nwith the most potent virtues; that one would restore to health a brother\r\non the verge of death; that another would paralyse into idiocy their\r\nwisest sage; that a third would strike lifeless to the dust their most\r\nstalwart champion; that tears and laughter, vigour and disease, madness\r\nand reason, wakefulness and sleep, existence and dissolution, were\r\ncoiled up in those unregarded leaves,--would they not have held him a\r\nsorcerer or a liar? To half the virtues of the vegetable world mankind\r\nare yet in the darkness of the savages I have supposed. There are\r\nfaculties within us with which certain herbs have affinity, and over\r\nwhich they have power. The moly of the ancients is not all a fable.”\r\n\r\nThe apparent character of Mejnour differed in much from that of Zanoni;\r\nand while it fascinated Glyndon less, it subdued and impressed him\r\nmore. The conversation of Zanoni evinced a deep and general interest for\r\nmankind,--a feeling approaching to enthusiasm for art and beauty. The\r\nstories circulated concerning his habits elevated the mystery of his\r\nlife by actions of charity and beneficence. And in all this there\r\nwas something genial and humane that softened the awe he created, and\r\ntended, perhaps, to raise suspicions as to the loftier secrets that he\r\narrogated to himself. But Mejnour seemed wholly indifferent to all the\r\nactual world. If he committed no evil, he seemed equally apathetic to\r\ngood. His deeds relieved no want, his words pitied no distress. What\r\nwe call the heart appeared to have merged into the intellect. He moved,\r\nthought, and lived like some regular and calm abstraction, rather than\r\none who yet retained, with the form, the feelings and sympathies of his\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nGlyndon once, observing the tone of supreme indifference with which he\r\nspoke of those changes on the face of earth which he asserted he had\r\nwitnessed, ventured to remark to him the distinction he had noted.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said Mejnour, coldly. “My life is the life that\r\ncontemplates,--Zanoni’s is the life that enjoys: when I gather the herb,\r\nI think but of its uses; Zanoni will pause to admire its beauties.”\r\n\r\n“And you deem your own the superior and the loftier existence?”\r\n\r\n“No. His is the existence of youth,--mine of age. We have cultivated\r\ndifferent faculties. Each has powers the other cannot aspire to. Those\r\nwith whom he associates live better,--those who associate with me know\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard, in truth,” said Glyndon, “that his companions at Naples\r\nwere observed to lead purer and nobler lives after intercourse with\r\nZanoni; yet were they not strange companions, at the best, for a sage?\r\nThis terrible power, too, that he exercises at will, as in the death of\r\nthe Prince di --, and that of the Count Ughelli, scarcely becomes the\r\ntranquil seeker after good.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Mejnour, with an icy smile; “such must ever be the error of\r\nthose philosophers who would meddle with the active life of mankind. You\r\ncannot serve some without injuring others; you cannot protect the good\r\nwithout warring on the bad; and if you desire to reform the faulty, why,\r\nyou must lower yourself to live with the faulty to know their faults.\r\nEven so saith Paracelsus, a great man, though often wrong. [‘It is as\r\nnecessary to know evil things as good; for who can know what is good\r\nwithout the knowing what is evil?’ etc.--Paracelsus, ‘De Nat. Rer.,’\r\nlib. 3.) Not mine this folly; I live but in knowledge,--I have no life\r\nin mankind!”\r\n\r\nAnother time Glyndon questioned the mystic as to the nature of that\r\nunion or fraternity to which Zanoni had once referred.\r\n\r\n“I am right, I suppose,” said he, “in conjecturing that you and himself\r\nprofess to be the brothers of the Rosy Cross?”\r\n\r\n“Do you imagine,” answered Mejnour, “that there were no mystic and\r\nsolemn unions of men seeking the same end through the same means before\r\nthe Arabians of Damus, in 1378, taught to a wandering German the secrets\r\nwhich founded the Institution of the Rosicrucians? I allow, however,\r\nthat the Rosicrucians formed a sect descended from the greater and\r\nearlier school. They were wiser than the Alchemists,--their masters are\r\nwiser than they.”\r\n\r\n“And of this early and primary order how many still exist?”\r\n\r\n“Zanoni and myself.”\r\n\r\n“What, two only!--and you profess the power to teach to all the secret\r\nthat baffles Death?”\r\n\r\n“Your ancestor attained that secret; he died rather than survive the\r\nonly thing he loved. We have, my pupil, no arts by which we CAN PUT\r\nDEATH OUT OF OUR OPTION, or out of the will of Heaven. These walls may\r\ncrush me as I stand. All that we profess to do is but this,--to find\r\nout the secrets of the human frame; to know why the parts ossify and the\r\nblood stagnates, and to apply continual preventives to the effects of\r\ntime. This is not magic; it is the art of medicine rightly understood.\r\nIn our order we hold most noble,--first, that knowledge which elevates\r\nthe intellect; secondly, that which preserves the body. But the mere art\r\n(extracted from the juices and simples) which recruits the animal vigour\r\nand arrests the progress of decay, or that more noble secret, which I\r\nwill only hint to thee at present, by which HEAT, or CALORIC, as ye\r\ncall it, being, as Heraclitus wisely taught, the primordial principle\r\nof life, can be made its perpetual renovater,--these I say, would not\r\nsuffice for safety. It is ours also to disarm and elude the wrath of\r\nmen, to turn the swords of our foes against each other, to glide (if\r\nnot incorporeal) invisible to eyes over which we can throw a mist and\r\ndarkness. And this some seers have professed to be the virtue of a stone\r\nof agate. Abaris placed it in his arrow. I will find you an herb in yon\r\nvalley that will give a surer charm than the agate and the arrow. In one\r\nword, know this, that the humblest and meanest products of Nature are\r\nthose from which the sublimest properties are to be drawn.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Glyndon, “if possessed of these great secrets, why\r\nso churlish in withholding their diffusion? Does not the false or\r\ncharlatanic science differ in this from the true and indisputable,--that\r\nthe last communicates to the world the process by which it attains its\r\ndiscoveries; the first boasts of marvellous results, and refuses to\r\nexplain the causes?”\r\n\r\n“Well said, O Logician of the Schools; but think again. Suppose we were\r\nto impart all our knowledge to all mankind indiscriminately,--alike to\r\nthe vicious and the virtuous,--should we be benefactors or scourges?\r\nImagine the tyrant, the sensualist, the evil and corrupted being\r\npossessed of these tremendous powers; would he not be a demon let loose\r\non earth? Grant that the same privilege be accorded also to the good;\r\nand in what state would be society? Engaged in a Titan war,--the good\r\nforever on the defensive, the bad forever in assault. In the present\r\ncondition of the earth, evil is a more active principle than good, and\r\nthe evil would prevail. It is for these reasons that we are not only\r\nsolemnly bound to administer our lore only to those who will not misuse\r\nand pervert it, but that we place our ordeal in tests that purify\r\nthe passions and elevate the desires. And Nature in this controls and\r\nassists us: for it places awful guardians and insurmountable barriers\r\nbetween the ambition of vice and the heaven of the loftier science.”\r\n\r\nSuch made a small part of the numerous conversations Mejnour held\r\nwith his pupil,--conversations that, while they appeared to address\r\nthemselves to the reason, inflamed yet more the fancy. It was the very\r\ndisclaiming of all powers which Nature, properly investigated, did\r\nnot suffice to create, that gave an air of probability to those which\r\nMejnour asserted Nature might bestow.\r\n\r\nThus days and weeks rolled on; and the mind of Glyndon, gradually fitted\r\nto this sequestered and musing life, forgot at last the vanities and\r\nchimeras of the world without.\r\n\r\nOne evening he had lingered alone and late upon the ramparts, watching\r\nthe stars as, one by one, they broke upon the twilight. Never had he\r\nfelt so sensibly the mighty power of the heavens and the earth upon man;\r\nhow much the springs of our intellectual being are moved and acted upon\r\nby the solemn influences of Nature. As a patient on whom, slowly and by\r\ndegrees, the agencies of mesmerism are brought to bear, he acknowledged\r\nto his heart the growing force of that vast and universal magnetism\r\nwhich is the life of creation, and binds the atom to the whole. A\r\nstrange and ineffable consciousness of power, of the SOMETHING GREAT\r\nwithin the perishable clay, appealed to feelings at once dim and\r\nglorious,--like the faint recognitions of a holier and former being. An\r\nimpulse, that he could not resist, led him to seek the mystic. He would\r\ndemand, that hour, his initiation into the worlds beyond our world,--he\r\nwas prepared to breathe a diviner air. He entered the castle, and strode\r\nthe shadowy and starlit gallery which conducted to Mejnour’s apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.III.\r\n\r\n     Man is the eye of things.--Euryph, “de Vit. Hum.”\r\n\r\n     ...There is, therefore, a certain ecstatical or transporting\r\n     power, which, if at any time it shall be excited or stirred up by\r\n     an ardent desire and most strong imagination, is able to conduct\r\n     the spirit of the more outward even to some absent and\r\n     far-distant object.--Von Helmont.\r\n\r\nThe rooms that Mejnour occupied consisted of two chambers communicating\r\nwith each other, and a third in which he slept. All these rooms\r\nwere placed in the huge square tower that beetled over the dark and\r\nbush-grown precipice. The first chamber which Glyndon entered was empty.\r\nWith a noiseless step he passed on, and opened the door that admitted\r\ninto the inner one. He drew back at the threshold, overpowered by a\r\nstrong fragrance which filled the chamber: a kind of mist thickened the\r\nair rather than obscured it, for this vapour was not dark, but resembled\r\na snow-cloud moving slowly, and in heavy undulations, wave upon wave\r\nregularly over the space. A mortal cold struck to the Englishman’s\r\nheart, and his blood froze. He stood rooted to the spot; and as his eyes\r\nstrained involuntarily through the vapour, he fancied (for he could not\r\nbe sure that it was not the trick of his imagination) that he saw dim,\r\nspectre-like, but gigantic forms floating through the mist; or was it\r\nnot rather the mist itself that formed its vapours fantastically into\r\nthose moving, impalpable, and bodiless apparitions? A great painter\r\nof antiquity is said, in a picture of Hades, to have represented the\r\nmonsters that glide through the ghostly River of the Dead, so artfully,\r\nthat the eye perceived at once that the river itself was but a spectre,\r\nand the bloodless things that tenanted it had no life, their forms\r\nblending with the dead waters till, as the eye continued to gaze, it\r\nceased to discern them from the preternatural element they were supposed\r\nto inhabit. Such were the moving outlines that coiled and floated\r\nthrough the mist; but before Glyndon had even drawn breath in this\r\natmosphere--for his life itself seemed arrested or changed into a kind\r\nof horrid trance--he felt his hand seized, and he was led from that room\r\ninto the outer one. He heard the door close,--his blood rushed again\r\nthrough his veins, and he saw Mejnour by his side. Strong convulsions\r\nthen suddenly seized his whole frame,--he fell to the ground insensible.\r\nWhen he recovered, he found himself in the open air in a rude balcony of\r\nstone that jutted from the chamber, the stars shining serenely over the\r\ndark abyss below, and resting calmly upon the face of the mystic, who\r\nstood beside him with folded arms.\r\n\r\n“Young man,” said Mejnour, “judge by what you have just felt, how\r\ndangerous it is to seek knowledge until prepared to receive it. Another\r\nmoment in the air of that chamber and you had been a corpse.”\r\n\r\n“Then of what nature was the knowledge that you, once mortal like\r\nmyself, could safely have sought in that icy atmosphere, which it was\r\ndeath for me to breathe? Mejnour,” continued Glyndon, and his wild\r\ndesire, sharpened by the very danger he had passed, once more animated\r\nand nerved him, “I am prepared at least for the first steps. I come to\r\nyou as of old the pupil to the Hierophant, and demand the initiation.”\r\n\r\nMejnour passed his hand over the young man’s heart,--it beat loud,\r\nregularly, and boldly. He looked at him with something almost like\r\nadmiration in his passionless and frigid features, and muttered, half\r\nto himself, “Surely, in so much courage the true disciple is found at\r\nlast.” Then, speaking aloud, he added, “Be it so; man’s first initiation\r\nis in TRANCE. In dreams commences all human knowledge; in dreams\r\nhovers over measureless space the first faint bridge between spirit and\r\nspirit,--this world and the worlds beyond! Look steadfastly on yonder\r\nstar!”\r\n\r\nGlyndon obeyed, and Mejnour retired into the chamber, from which there\r\nthen slowly emerged a vapour, somewhat paler and of fainter odour than\r\nthat which had nearly produced so fatal an effect on his frame. This,\r\non the contrary, as it coiled around him, and then melted in thin spires\r\ninto the air, breathed a refreshing and healthful fragrance. He still\r\nkept his eyes on the star, and the star seemed gradually to fix and\r\ncommand his gaze. A sort of languor next seized his frame, but without,\r\nas he thought, communicating itself to the mind; and as this crept over\r\nhim, he felt his temples sprinkled with some volatile and fiery essence.\r\nAt the same moment a slight tremor shook his limbs and thrilled through\r\nhis veins. The languor increased, still he kept his gaze upon the star,\r\nand now its luminous circumference seemed to expand and dilate. It\r\nbecame gradually softer and clearer in its light; spreading wider and\r\nbroader, it diffused all space,--all space seemed swallowed up in it.\r\nAnd at last, in the midst of a silver shining atmosphere, he felt as if\r\nsomething burst within his brain,--as if a strong chain were broken; and\r\nat that moment a sense of heavenly liberty, of unutterable delight, of\r\nfreedom from the body, of birdlike lightness, seemed to float him\r\ninto the space itself. “Whom, now upon earth, dost thou wish to see?”\r\n whispered the voice of Mejnour. “Viola and Zanoni!” answered Glyndon, in\r\nhis heart; but he felt that his lips moved not.\r\n\r\nSuddenly at that thought,--through this space, in which nothing save one\r\nmellow translucent light had been discernible,--a swift succession\r\nof shadowy landscapes seemed to roll: trees, mountains, cities, seas,\r\nglided along like the changes of a phantasmagoria; and at last,\r\nsettled and stationary, he saw a cave by the gradual marge of an ocean\r\nshore,--myrtles and orange-trees clothing the gentle banks. On a height,\r\nat a distance, gleamed the white but shattered relics of some ruined\r\nheathen edifice; and the moon, in calm splendour, shining over all,\r\nliterally bathed with its light two forms without the cave, at whose\r\nfeet the blue waters crept, and he thought that he even heard them\r\nmurmur. He recognised both the figures. Zanoni was seated on a fragment\r\nof stone; Viola, half-reclining by his side, was looking into his face,\r\nwhich was bent down to her, and in her countenance was the expression of\r\nthat perfect happiness which belongs to perfect love. “Wouldst thou hear\r\nthem speak?” whispered Mejnour; and again, without sound, Glyndon inly\r\nanswered, “Yes!” Their voices then came to his ear, but in tones that\r\nseemed to him strange; so subdued were they, and sounding, as it were,\r\nso far off, that they were as voices heard in the visions of some holier\r\nmen from a distant sphere.\r\n\r\n“And how is it,” said Viola, “that thou canst find pleasure in listening\r\nto the ignorant?”\r\n\r\n“Because the heart is never ignorant; because the mysteries of the\r\nfeelings are as full of wonder as those of the intellect. If at times\r\nthou canst not comprehend the language of my thoughts, at times also I\r\nhear sweet enigmas in that of thy emotions.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, say not so!” said Viola, winding her arm tenderly round his neck,\r\nand under that heavenly light her face seemed lovelier for its blushes.\r\n“For the enigmas are but love’s common language, and love should solve\r\nthem. Till I knew thee,--till I lived with thee; till I learned to\r\nwatch for thy footstep when absent: yet even in absence to see\r\nthee everywhere!--I dreamed not how strong and all-pervading is the\r\nconnection between nature and the human soul!...\r\n\r\n“And yet,” she continued, “I am now assured of what I at first\r\nbelieved,--that the feelings which attracted me towards thee at first\r\nwere not those of love. I know THAT, by comparing the present with the\r\npast,--it was a sentiment then wholly of the mind or the spirit! I could\r\nnot hear thee now say, ‘Viola, be happy with another!’”\r\n\r\n“And I could not now tell thee so! Ah, Viola, never be weary of assuring\r\nme that thou art happy!”\r\n\r\n“Happy while thou art so. Yet at times, Zanoni, thou art so sad!”\r\n\r\n“Because human life is so short; because we must part at last; because\r\nyon moon shines on when the nightingale sings to it no more! A little\r\nwhile, and thine eyes will grow dim, and thy beauty haggard, and these\r\nlocks that I toy with now will be grey and loveless.”\r\n\r\n“And thou, cruel one!” said Viola, touchingly, “I shall never see the\r\nsigns of age in thee! But shall we not grow old together, and our eyes\r\nbe accustomed to a change which the heart shall not share!”\r\n\r\nZanoni sighed. He turned away, and seemed to commune with himself.\r\n\r\nGlyndon’s attention grew yet more earnest.\r\n\r\n“But were it so,” muttered Zanoni; and then looking steadfastly at\r\nViola, he said, with a half-smile, “Hast thou no curiosity to learn more\r\nof the lover thou once couldst believe the agent of the Evil One?”\r\n\r\n“None; all that one wishes to know of the beloved one, I know--THAT THOU\r\nLOVEST ME!”\r\n\r\n“I have told thee that my life is apart from others. Wouldst thou not\r\nseek to share it?”\r\n\r\n“I share it now!”\r\n\r\n“But were it possible to be thus young and fair forever, till the world\r\nblazes round us as one funeral pyre!”\r\n\r\n“We shall be so, when we leave the world!”\r\n\r\nZanoni was mute for some moments, and at length he said,--\r\n\r\n“Canst thou recall those brilliant and aerial dreams which once visited\r\nthee, when thou didst fancy that thou wert preordained to some fate\r\naloof and afar from the common children of the earth?”\r\n\r\n“Zanoni, the fate is found.”\r\n\r\n“And hast thou no terror of the future?”\r\n\r\n“The future! I forget it! Time past and present and to come reposes\r\nin thy smile. Ah, Zanoni, play not with the foolish credulities of my\r\nyouth! I have been better and humbler since thy presence has dispelled\r\nthe mist of the air. The future!--well, when I have cause to dread it, I\r\nwill look up to heaven, and remember who guides our fate!”\r\n\r\nAs she lifted her eyes above, a dark cloud swept suddenly over the\r\nscene. It wrapped the orange-trees, the azure ocean, the dense sands;\r\nbut still the last images that it veiled from the charmed eyes of\r\nGlyndon were the forms of Viola and Zanoni. The face of the one rapt,\r\nserene, and radiant; the face of the other, dark, thoughtful, and locked\r\nin more than its usual rigidness of melancholy beauty and profound\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\n“Rouse thyself,” said Mejnour; “thy ordeal has commenced! There are\r\npretenders to the solemn science who could have shown thee the\r\nabsent, and prated to thee, in their charlatanic jargon, of the secret\r\nelectricities and the magnetic fluid of whose true properties they know\r\nbut the germs and elements. I will lend thee the books of those glorious\r\ndupes, and thou wilt find, in the dark ages, how many erring steps have\r\nstumbled upon the threshold of the mighty learning, and fancied they\r\nhad pierced the temple. Hermes and Albert and Paracelsus, I knew ye all;\r\nbut, noble as ye were, ye were fated to be deceived. Ye had not souls\r\nof faith, and daring fitted for the destinies at which ye aimed! Yet\r\nParacelsus--modest Paracelsus--had an arrogance that soared higher than\r\nall our knowledge. Ho, ho!--he thought he could make a race of men from\r\nchemistry; he arrogated to himself the Divine gift,--the breath of life.\r\n(Paracelsus, ‘De Nat. Rer.,’ lib. i.)\r\n\r\n“He would have made men, and, after all, confessed that they could be but\r\npygmies! My art is to make men above mankind. But you are impatient of\r\nmy digressions. Forgive me. All these men (they were great dreamers, as\r\nyou desire to be) were intimate friends of mine. But they are dead and\r\nrotten. They talked of spirits,--but they dreaded to be in other company\r\nthan that of men. Like orators whom I have heard, when I stood by the\r\nPnyx of Athens, blazing with words like comets in the assembly, and\r\nextinguishing their ardour like holiday rockets when they were in the\r\nfield. Ho, ho! Demosthenes, my hero-coward, how nimble were thy heels\r\nat Chaeronea! And thou art impatient still! Boy, I could tell thee such\r\ntruths of the past as would make thee the luminary of schools. But thou\r\nlustest only for the shadows of the future. Thou shalt have thy wish.\r\nBut the mind must be first exercised and trained. Go to thy room, and\r\nsleep; fast austerely, read no books; meditate, imagine, dream, bewilder\r\nthyself if thou wilt. Thought shapes out its own chaos at last. Before\r\nmidnight, seek me again!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.IV.\r\n\r\n     It is fit that we who endeavour to rise to an elevation so\r\n     sublime, should study first to leave behind carnal affections,\r\n     the frailty of the senses, the passions that belong to matter;\r\n     secondly, to learn by what means we may ascend to the climax of\r\n     pure intellect, united with the powers above, without which never\r\n     can we gain the lore of secret things, nor the magic that effects\r\n     true wonders.--Tritemius “On Secret Things and Secret Spirits.”\r\n\r\nIt wanted still many minutes of midnight, and Glyndon was once more in\r\nthe apartment of the mystic. He had rigidly observed the fast ordained\r\nto him; and in the rapt and intense reveries into which his excited\r\nfancy had plunged him, he was not only insensible to the wants of the\r\nflesh,--he felt above them.\r\n\r\nMejnour, seated beside his disciple, thus addressed him:--\r\n\r\n“Man is arrogant in proportion to his ignorance. Man’s natural tendency\r\nis to egotism. Man, in his infancy of knowledge, thinks that all\r\ncreation was formed for him. For several ages he saw in the countless\r\nworlds that sparkle through space like the bubbles of a shoreless ocean\r\nonly the petty candles, the household torches, that Providence had\r\nbeen pleased to light for no other purpose but to make the night more\r\nagreeable to man. Astronomy has corrected this delusion of human vanity;\r\nand man now reluctantly confesses that the stars are worlds larger and\r\nmore glorious than his own,--that the earth on which he crawls is a\r\nscarce visible speck on the vast chart of creation. But in the small as\r\nin the vast, God is equally profuse of life. The traveller looks upon\r\nthe tree, and fancies its boughs were formed for his shelter in the\r\nsummer sun, or his fuel in the winter frosts. But in each leaf of these\r\nboughs the Creator has made a world; it swarms with innumerable races.\r\nEach drop of the water in yon moat is an orb more populous than a\r\nkingdom is of men. Everywhere, then, in this immense design, science\r\nbrings new life to light. Life is the one pervading principle, and even\r\nthe thing that seems to die and putrify but engenders new life, and\r\nchanges to fresh forms of matter. Reasoning, then, by evident analogy:\r\nif not a leaf, if not a drop of water, but is, no less than yonder star,\r\na habitable and breathing world,--nay, if even man himself is a world to\r\nother lives, and millions and myriads dwell in the rivers of his blood,\r\nand inhabit man’s frame as man inhabits earth, commonsense (if your\r\nschoolmen had it) would suffice to teach that the circumfluent infinite\r\nwhich you call space--the countless Impalpable which divides earth\r\nfrom the moon and stars--is filled also with its correspondent and\r\nappropriate life. Is it not a visible absurdity to suppose that being is\r\ncrowded upon every leaf, and yet absent from the immensities of space?\r\nThe law of the Great System forbids the waste even of an atom; it\r\nknows no spot where something of life does not breathe. In the very\r\ncharnel-house is the nursery of production and animation. Is that true?\r\nWell, then, can you conceive that space, which is the Infinite itself,\r\nis alone a waste, is alone lifeless, is less useful to the one design of\r\nuniversal being than the dead carcass of a dog, than the peopled leaf,\r\nthan the swarming globule? The microscope shows you the creatures on the\r\nleaf; no mechanical tube is yet invented to discover the nobler and more\r\ngifted things that hover in the illimitable air. Yet between these last\r\nand man is a mysterious and terrible affinity. And hence, by tales and\r\nlegends, not wholly false nor wholly true, have arisen from time to\r\ntime, beliefs in apparitions and spectres. If more common to the earlier\r\nand simpler tribes than to the men of your duller age, it is but that,\r\nwith the first, the senses are more keen and quick. And as the savage\r\ncan see or scent miles away the traces of a foe, invisible to the gross\r\nsense of the civilised animal, so the barrier itself between him and\r\nthe creatures of the airy world is less thickened and obscured. Do you\r\nlisten?”\r\n\r\n“With my soul!”\r\n\r\n“But first, to penetrate this barrier, the soul with which you listen\r\nmust be sharpened by intense enthusiasm, purified from all earthlier\r\ndesires. Not without reason have the so-styled magicians, in all\r\nlands and times, insisted on chastity and abstemious reverie as the\r\ncommunicants of inspiration. When thus prepared, science can be brought\r\nto aid it; the sight itself may be rendered more subtle, the nerves more\r\nacute, the spirit more alive and outward, and the element itself--the\r\nair, the space--may be made, by certain secrets of the higher chemistry,\r\nmore palpable and clear. And this, too, is not magic, as the credulous\r\ncall it; as I have so often said before, magic (or science that violates\r\nNature) exists not: it is but the science by which Nature can be\r\ncontrolled. Now, in space there are millions of beings not literally\r\nspiritual, for they have all, like the animalculae unseen by the naked\r\neye, certain forms of matter, though matter so delicate, air-drawn, and\r\nsubtle, that it is, as it were, but a film, a gossamer that clothes the\r\nspirit. Hence the Rosicrucian’s lovely phantoms of sylph and gnome. Yet,\r\nin truth, these races and tribes differ more widely, each from each,\r\nthan the Calmuc from the Greek,--differ in attributes and powers. In the\r\ndrop of water you see how the animalculae vary, how vast and terrible\r\nare some of those monster mites as compared with others. Equally so with\r\nthe inhabitants of the atmosphere: some of surpassing wisdom, some of\r\nhorrible malignity; some hostile as fiends to men, others gentle as\r\nmessengers between earth and heaven.\r\n\r\n“He who would establish intercourse with these varying beings resembles\r\nthe traveller who would penetrate into unknown lands. He is exposed to\r\nstrange dangers and unconjectured terrors. THAT INTERCOURSE ONCE GAINED,\r\nI CANNOT SECURE THEE FROM THE CHANCES TO WHICH THY JOURNEY IS EXPOSED.\r\nI cannot direct thee to paths free from the wanderings of the deadliest\r\nfoes. Thou must alone, and of thyself, face and hazard all. But if thou\r\nart so enamoured of life as to care only to live on, no matter for what\r\nends, recruiting the nerves and veins with the alchemist’s vivifying\r\nelixir, why seek these dangers from the intermediate tribes? Because the\r\nvery elixir that pours a more glorious life into the frame, so sharpens\r\nthe senses that those larvae of the air become to thee audible and\r\napparent; so that, unless trained by degrees to endure the phantoms and\r\nsubdue their malice, a life thus gifted would be the most awful doom\r\nman could bring upon himself. Hence it is, that though the elixir be\r\ncompounded of the simplest herbs, his frame only is prepared to receive\r\nit who has gone through the subtlest trials. Nay, some, scared and\r\ndaunted into the most intolerable horror by the sights that burst upon\r\ntheir eyes at the first draft, have found the potion less powerful to\r\nsave than the agony and travail of Nature to destroy. To the unprepared\r\nthe elixir is thus but the deadliest poison. Amidst the dwellers of\r\nthe threshold is ONE, too, surpassing in malignity and hatred all her\r\ntribe,--one whose eyes have paralyzed the bravest, and whose power\r\nincreases over the spirit precisely in proportion to its fear. Does thy\r\ncourage falter?”\r\n\r\n“Nay; thy words but kindle it.”\r\n\r\n“Follow me, then, and submit to the initiatory labours.”\r\n\r\nWith that, Mejnour led him into the interior chamber, and proceeded\r\nto explain to him certain chemical operations which, though extremely\r\nsimple in themselves, Glyndon soon perceived were capable of very\r\nextraordinary results.\r\n\r\n“In the remoter times,” said Mejnour, smiling, “our brotherhood were\r\noften compelled to recur to delusions to protect realities; and, as\r\ndexterous mechanicians or expert chemists, they obtained the name\r\nof sorcerers. Observe how easy to construct is the Spectre Lion that\r\nattended the renowned Leonardo da Vinci!”\r\n\r\nAnd Glyndon beheld with delighted surprise the simple means by which the\r\nwildest cheats of the imagination can be formed. The magical landscapes\r\nin which Baptista Porta rejoiced; the apparent change of the seasons\r\nwith which Albertus Magnus startled the Earl of Holland; nay, even those\r\nmore dread delusions of the Ghost and Image with which the necromancers\r\nof Heraclea woke the conscience of the conqueror of Plataea\r\n(Pausanias,--see Plutarch.),--all these, as the showman enchants\r\nsome trembling children on a Christmas Eve with his lantern and\r\nphantasmagoria, Mejnour exhibited to his pupil.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“And now laugh forever at magic! when these, the very tricks, the very\r\nsports and frivolities of science, were the very acts which men viewed\r\nwith abhorrence, and inquisitors and kings rewarded with the rack and\r\nthe stake.”\r\n\r\n“But the alchemist’s transmutation of metals--”\r\n\r\n“Nature herself is a laboratory in which metals, and all elements, are\r\nforever at change. Easy to make gold,--easier, more commodious, and\r\ncheaper still, to make the pearl, the diamond, and the ruby. Oh, yes;\r\nwise men found sorcery in this too; but they found no sorcery in the\r\ndiscovery that by the simplest combination of things of every-day use\r\nthey could raise a devil that would sweep away thousands of their kind\r\nby the breath of consuming fire. Discover what will destroy life, and\r\nyou are a great man!--what will prolong it, and you are an imposter!\r\nDiscover some invention in machinery that will make the rich more rich\r\nand the poor more poor, and they will build you a statue! Discover some\r\nmystery in art that will equalise physical disparities, and they will\r\npull down their own houses to stone you! Ha, ha, my pupil! such is\r\nthe world Zanoni still cares for!--you and I will leave this world to\r\nitself. And now that you have seen some few of the effects of science,\r\nbegin to learn its grammar.”\r\n\r\nMejnour then set before his pupil certain tasks, in which the rest of\r\nthe night wore itself away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.V.\r\n\r\n     Great travell hath the gentle Calidore\r\n     And toyle endured...\r\n     There on a day,--He chaunst to spy a sort of shepheard groomes,\r\n     Playing on pipes and caroling apace.\r\n     ...He, there besyde\r\n     Saw a faire damzell.\r\n     --Spenser, “Faerie Queene,” cant. ix.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable period the pupil of Mejnour was now absorbed in\r\nlabour dependent on the most vigilant attention, on the most minute and\r\nsubtle calculation. Results astonishing and various rewarded his toils\r\nand stimulated his interest. Nor were these studies limited to chemical\r\ndiscovery,--in which it is permitted me to say that the greatest marvels\r\nupon the organisation of physical life seemed wrought by experiments\r\nof the vivifying influence of heat. Mejnour professed to find a\r\nlink between all intellectual beings in the existence of a certain\r\nall-pervading and invisible fluid resembling electricity, yet distinct\r\nfrom the known operations of that mysterious agency--a fluid that\r\nconnected thought to thought with the rapidity and precision of the\r\nmodern telegraph, and the influence of this fluid, according to Mejnour,\r\nextended to the remotest past,--that is to say, whenever and wheresoever\r\nman had thought. Thus, if the doctrine were true, all human knowledge\r\nbecame attainable through a medium established between the brain of the\r\nindividual inquirer and all the farthest and obscurest regions in the\r\nuniverse of ideas. Glyndon was surprised to find Mejnour attached to the\r\nabstruse mysteries which the Pythagoreans ascribed to the occult science\r\nof NUMBERS. In this last, new lights glimmered dimly on his eyes; and\r\nhe began to perceive that even the power to predict, or rather to\r\ncalculate, results, might by-- (Here there is an erasure in the MS.)\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nBut he observed that the last brief process by which, in each of these\r\nexperiments, the wonder was achieved, Mejnour reserved for himself,\r\nand refused to communicate the secret. The answer he obtained to his\r\nremonstrances on this head was more stern than satisfactory:\r\n\r\n“Dost thou think,” said Mejnour, “that I would give to the mere pupil,\r\nwhose qualities are not yet tried, powers that might change the face of\r\nthe social world? The last secrets are intrusted only to him of whose\r\nvirtue the Master is convinced. Patience! It is labour itself that is\r\nthe great purifier of the mind; and by degrees the secrets will grow\r\nupon thyself as thy mind becomes riper to receive them.”\r\n\r\nAt last Mejnour professed himself satisfied with the progress made by\r\nhis pupil. “The hour now arrives,” he said, “when thou mayst pass the\r\ngreat but airy barrier,--when thou mayst gradually confront the terrible\r\nDweller of the Threshold. Continue thy labours--continue to surpass\r\nthine impatience for results until thou canst fathom the causes. I leave\r\nthee for one month; if at the end of that period, when I return, the\r\ntasks set thee are completed, and thy mind prepared by contemplation\r\nand austere thought for the ordeal, I promise thee the ordeal shall\r\ncommence. One caution alone I give thee: regard it as a peremptory\r\ncommand, enter not this chamber!” (They were then standing in the room\r\nwhere their experiments had been chiefly made, and in which Glyndon, on\r\nthe night he had sought the solitude of the mystic, had nearly fallen a\r\nvictim to his intrusion.)\r\n\r\n“Enter not this chamber till my return; or, above all, if by any search\r\nfor materials necessary to thy toils thou shouldst venture hither,\r\nforbear to light the naphtha in those vessels, and to open the vases on\r\nyonder shelves. I leave the key of the room in thy keeping, in order to\r\ntry thy abstinence and self-control. Young man, this very temptation is\r\na part of thy trial.”\r\n\r\nWith that, Mejnour placed the key in his hands; and at sunset he left\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\nFor several days Glyndon continued immersed in employments which\r\nstrained to the utmost all the faculties of his intellect. Even the most\r\npartial success depended so entirely on the abstraction of the mind, and\r\nthe minuteness of its calculations, that there was scarcely room for any\r\nother thought than those absorbed in the occupation. And doubtless this\r\nperpetual strain of the faculties was the object of Mejnour in works\r\nthat did not seem exactly pertinent to the purposes in view. As the\r\nstudy of the elementary mathematics, for example, is not so profitable\r\nin the solving of problems, useless in our after-callings, as it is\r\nserviceable in training the intellect to the comprehension and analysis\r\nof general truths.\r\n\r\nBut in less than half the time which Mejnour had stated for the duration\r\nof his absence, all that the mystic had appointed to his toils was\r\ncompleted by the pupil; and then his mind, thus relieved from the\r\ndrudgery and mechanism of employment, once more sought occupation in dim\r\nconjecture and restless fancies. His inquisitive and rash nature grew\r\nexcited by the prohibition of Mejnour, and he found himself gazing\r\ntoo often, with perturbed and daring curiosity, upon the key of the\r\nforbidden chamber. He began to feel indignant at a trial of constancy\r\nwhich he deemed frivolous and puerile. What nursery tales of Bluebeard\r\nand his closet were revived to daunt and terrify him! How could the\r\nmere walls of a chamber, in which he had so often securely pursued his\r\nlabours, start into living danger? If haunted, it could be but by those\r\ndelusions which Mejnour had taught him to despise,--a shadowy lion,--a\r\nchemical phantasm! Tush! he lost half his awe of Mejnour, when he\r\nthought that by such tricks the sage could practise upon the very\r\nintellect he had awakened and instructed! Still he resisted the impulses\r\nof his curiosity and his pride, and, to escape from their dictation, he\r\ntook long rambles on the hills, or amidst the valleys that surrounded\r\nthe castle,--seeking by bodily fatigue to subdue the unreposing mind.\r\nOne day suddenly emerging from a dark ravine, he came upon one of those\r\nItalian scenes of rural festivity and mirth in which the classic age\r\nappears to revive. It was a festival, partly agricultural, partly\r\nreligious, held yearly by the peasants of that district. Assembled\r\nat the outskirts of a village, animated crowds, just returned from a\r\nprocession to a neighbouring chapel, were now forming themselves into\r\ngroups: the old to taste the vintage, the young to dance,--all to be\r\ngay and happy. This sudden picture of easy joy and careless ignorance,\r\ncontrasting so forcibly with the intense studies and that parching\r\ndesire for wisdom which had so long made up his own life, and burned at\r\nhis own heart, sensibly affected Glyndon. As he stood aloof and gazing\r\non them, the young man felt once more that he was young. The memory of\r\nall he had been content to sacrifice spoke to him like the sharp voice\r\nof remorse. The flitting forms of the women in their picturesque attire,\r\ntheir happy laughter ringing through the cool, still air of the autumn\r\nnoon, brought back to the heart, or rather perhaps to the senses, the\r\nimages of his past time, the “golden shepherd hours,” when to live was\r\nbut to enjoy.\r\n\r\nHe approached nearer and nearer to the scene, and suddenly a noisy\r\ngroup swept round him; and Maestro Paolo, tapping him familiarly on the\r\nshoulder, exclaimed in a hearty voice, “Welcome, Excellency!--we are\r\nrejoiced to see you amongst us.” Glyndon was about to reply to this\r\nsalutation, when his eyes rested upon the face of a young girl leaning\r\non Paolo’s arm, of a beauty so attractive that his colour rose and his\r\nheart beat as he encountered her gaze. Her eyes sparkled with a roguish\r\nand petulant mirth, her parted lips showed teeth like pearls; as if\r\nimpatient at the pause of her companion from the revel of the rest,\r\nher little foot beat the ground to a measure that she half-hummed,\r\nhalf-chanted. Paolo laughed as he saw the effect the girl had produced\r\nupon the young foreigner.\r\n\r\n“Will you not dance, Excellency? Come, lay aside your greatness, and be\r\nmerry, like us poor devils. See how our pretty Fillide is longing for a\r\npartner. Take compassion on her.”\r\n\r\nFillide pouted at this speech, and, disengaging her arm from Paolo’s,\r\nturned away, but threw over her shoulder a glance half inviting, half\r\ndefying. Glyndon, almost involuntarily, advanced to her, and addressed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nOh, yes; he addresses her! She looks down, and smiles. Paolo leaves them\r\nto themselves, sauntering off with a devil-me-carish air. Fillide speaks\r\nnow, and looks up at the scholar’s face with arch invitation. He shakes\r\nhis head; Fillide laughs, and her laugh is silvery. She points to a gay\r\nmountaineer, who is tripping up to her merrily. Why does Glyndon feel\r\njealous? Why, when she speaks again, does he shake his head no more? He\r\noffers his hand; Fillide blushes, and takes it with a demure coquetry.\r\nWhat! is it so, indeed! They whirl into the noisy circle of the\r\nrevellers. Ha! ha! is not this better than distilling herbs, and\r\nbreaking thy brains on Pythagorean numbers? How lightly Fillide bounds\r\nalong! How her lithesome waist supples itself to thy circling arm!\r\nTara-ra-tara, ta-tara, rara-ra! What the devil is in the measure that\r\nit makes the blood course like quicksilver through the veins? Was there\r\never a pair of eyes like Fillide’s? Nothing of the cold stars there! Yet\r\nhow they twinkle and laugh at thee! And that rosy, pursed-up mouth that\r\nwill answer so sparingly to thy flatteries, as if words were a waste of\r\ntime, and kisses were their proper language. Oh, pupil of Mejnour! Oh,\r\nwould-be Rosicrucian, Platonist, Magian, I know not what! I am ashamed\r\nof thee! What, in the names of Averroes and Burri and Agrippa and Hermes\r\nhave become of thy austere contemplations? Was it for this thou didst\r\nresign Viola? I don’t think thou hast the smallest recollection of the\r\nelixir or the Cabala. Take care! What are you about, sir? Why do you\r\nclasp that small hand locked within your own? Why do you--Tara-rara\r\ntara-ra tara-rara-ra, rarara, ta-ra, a-ra! Keep your eyes off those\r\nslender ankles and that crimson bodice! Tara-rara-ra! There they go\r\nagain! And now they rest under the broad trees. The revel has whirled\r\naway from them. They hear--or do they not hear--the laughter at the\r\ndistance? They see--or if they have their eyes about them, they SHOULD\r\nsee--couple after couple gliding by, love-talking and love-looking. But\r\nI will lay a wager, as they sit under that tree, and the round sun goes\r\ndown behind the mountains, that they see or hear very little except\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“Hollo, Signor Excellency! and how does your partner please you? Come\r\nand join our feast, loiterers; one dances more merrily after wine.”\r\n\r\nDown goes the round sun; up comes the autumn moon. Tara, tara, rarara,\r\nrarara, tarara-ra! Dancing again; is it a dance, or some movement gayer,\r\nnoisier, wilder still? How they glance and gleam through the night\r\nshadows, those flitting forms! What confusion!--what order! Ha, that is\r\nthe Tarantula dance; Maestro Paolo foots it bravely! Diavolo, what\r\nfury! the Tarantula has stung them all. Dance or die; it is fury,--the\r\nCorybantes, the Maenads, the--Ho, ho! more wine! the Sabbat of the\r\nWitches at Benevento is a joke to this! From cloud to cloud wanders the\r\nmoon,--now shining, now lost. Dimness while the maiden blushes; light\r\nwhen the maiden smiles.\r\n\r\n“Fillide, thou art an enchantress!”\r\n\r\n“Buona notte, Excellency; you will see me again!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, young man,” said an old, decrepit, hollow-eyed octogenarian,\r\nleaning on his staff, “make the best of your youth. I, too, once had\r\na Fillide! I was handsomer than you then! Alas! if we could be always\r\nyoung!”\r\n\r\n“Always young!” Glyndon started, as he turned his gaze from the fresh,\r\nfair, rosy face of the girl, and saw the eyes dropping rheum, the yellow\r\nwrinkled skin, the tottering frame of the old man.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” said the decrepit creature, hobbling near to him, and with a\r\nmalicious laugh. “Yet I, too, was young once! Give me a baioccho for a\r\nglass of aqua vitae!”\r\n\r\nTara, rara, ra-rara, tara, rara-ra! There dances Youth! Wrap thy rags\r\nround thee, and totter off, Old Age!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.VI.\r\n\r\n     Whilest Calidore does follow that faire mayd,\r\n     Unmindful of his vow and high beheast\r\n     Which by the Faerie Queene was on him layd.\r\n     --Spenser, “Faerie Queene,” cant. x. s. 1.\r\n\r\nIt was that grey, indistinct, struggling interval between the night and\r\nthe dawn, when Clarence stood once more in his chamber. The abstruse\r\ncalculations lying on his table caught his eye, and filled him with a\r\nsentiment of weariness and distaste. But--“Alas, if we could be\r\nalways young! Oh, thou horrid spectre of the old, rheum-eyed man!\r\nWhat apparition can the mystic chamber shadow forth more ugly and more\r\nhateful than thou? Oh, yes, if we could be always young! But not [thinks\r\nthe neophyte now]--not to labour forever at these crabbed figures and\r\nthese cold compounds of herbs and drugs. No; but to enjoy, to love, to\r\nrevel! What should be the companion of youth but pleasure? And the gift\r\nof eternal youth may be mine this very hour! What means this prohibition\r\nof Mejnour’s? Is it not of the same complexion as his ungenerous\r\nreserve even in the minutest secrets of chemistry, or the numbers of\r\nhis Cabala?--compelling me to perform all the toils, and yet withholding\r\nfrom me the knowledge of the crowning result? No doubt he will still,\r\non his return, show me that the great mystery CAN be attained; but will\r\nstill forbid ME to attain it. Is it not as if he desired to keep my\r\nyouth the slave to his age; to make me dependent solely on himself; to\r\nbind me to a journeyman’s service by perpetual excitement to curiosity,\r\nand the sight of the fruits he places beyond my lips?” These, and many\r\nreflections still more repining, disturbed and irritated him. Heated\r\nwith wine--excited by the wild revels he had left--he was unable to\r\nsleep. The image of that revolting Old Age which Time, unless defeated,\r\nmust bring upon himself, quickened the eagerness of his desire for the\r\ndazzling and imperishable Youth he ascribed to Zanoni. The prohibition\r\nonly served to create a spirit of defiance. The reviving day, laughing\r\njocundly through his lattice, dispelled all the fears and superstitions\r\nthat belong to night. The mystic chamber presented to his imagination\r\nnothing to differ from any other apartment in the castle. What foul or\r\nmalignant apparition could harm him in the light of that blessed sun!\r\nIt was the peculiar, and on the whole most unhappy, contradiction in\r\nGlyndon’s nature, that while his reasonings led him to doubt,--and doubt\r\nrendered him in MORAL conduct irresolute and unsteady; he was PHYSICALLY\r\nbrave to rashness. Nor is this uncommon: scepticism and presumption are\r\noften twins. When a man of this character determines upon any action,\r\npersonal fear never deters him; and for the moral fear, any sophistry\r\nsuffices to self-will. Almost without analysing himself the mental\r\nprocess by which his nerves hardened themselves and his limbs moved,\r\nhe traversed the corridor, gained Mejnour’s apartment, and opened the\r\nforbidden door. All was as he had been accustomed to see it, save\r\nthat on a table in the centre of the room lay open a large volume. He\r\napproached, and gazed on the characters on the page; they were in a\r\ncipher, the study of which had made a part of his labours. With but\r\nslight difficulty he imagined that he interpreted the meaning of the\r\nfirst sentences, and that they ran thus:--\r\n\r\n“To quaff the inner life, is to see the outer life: to live in defiance\r\nof time, is to live in the whole. He who discovers the elixir discovers\r\nwhat lies in space; for the spirit that vivifies the frame strengthens\r\nthe senses. There is attraction in the elementary principle of light.\r\nIn the lamps of Rosicrucius the fire is the pure elementary principle.\r\nKindle the lamps while thou openst the vessel that contains the elixir,\r\nand the light attracts towards thee those beings whose life is that\r\nlight. Beware of Fear. Fear is the deadliest enemy to Knowledge.” Here\r\nthe ciphers changed their character, and became incomprehensible. But\r\nhad he not read enough? Did not the last sentence suffice?--“Beware of\r\nFear!” It was as if Mejnour had purposely left the page open,--as if the\r\ntrial was, in truth, the reverse of the one pretended; as if the mystic\r\nhad designed to make experiment of his COURAGE while affecting but that\r\nof his FORBEARANCE. Not Boldness, but Fear, was the deadliest enemy\r\nto Knowledge. He moved to the shelves on which the crystal vases were\r\nplaced; with an untrembling hand he took from one of them the stopper,\r\nand a delicious odor suddenly diffused itself through the room. The air\r\nsparkled as if with a diamond-dust. A sense of unearthly delight,--of an\r\nexistence that seemed all spirit, flashed through his whole frame; and\r\na faint, low, but exquisite music crept, thrilling, through the chamber.\r\nAt this moment he heard a voice in the corridor calling on his name;\r\nand presently there was a knock at the door without. “Are you there,\r\nsignor?” said the clear tones of Maestro Paolo. Glyndon hastily reclosed\r\nand replaced the vial, and bidding Paolo await him in his own apartment,\r\ntarried till he heard the intruder’s steps depart; he then reluctantly\r\nquitted the room. As he locked the door, he still heard the dying\r\nstrain of that fairy music; and with a light step and a joyous heart he\r\nrepaired to Paolo, inly resolving to visit again the chamber at an hour\r\nwhen his experiment would be safe from interruption.\r\n\r\nAs he crossed his threshold, Paolo started back, and exclaimed, “Why,\r\nExcellency! I scarcely recognise you! Amusement, I see, is a great\r\nbeautifier to the young. Yesterday you looked so pale and haggard; but\r\nFillide’s merry eyes have done more for you than the Philosopher’s\r\nStone (saints forgive me for naming it) ever did for the wizards.”\r\n And Glyndon, glancing at the old Venetian mirror as Paolo spoke, was\r\nscarcely less startled than Paolo himself at the change in his own mien\r\nand bearing. His form, before bent with thought, seemed to him taller by\r\nhalf the head, so lithesome and erect rose his slender stature; his\r\neyes glowed, his cheeks bloomed with health and the innate and pervading\r\npleasure. If the mere fragrance of the elixir was thus potent, well\r\nmight the alchemists have ascribed life and youth to the draught!\r\n\r\n“You must forgive me, Excellency, for disturbing you,” said Paolo,\r\nproducing a letter from his pouch; “but our Patron has just written to\r\nme to say that he will be here to-morrow, and desired me to lose not a\r\nmoment in giving to yourself this billet, which he enclosed.”\r\n\r\n“Who brought the letter?”\r\n\r\n“A horseman, who did not wait for any reply.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon opened the letter, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n“I return a week sooner than I had intended, and you will expect me\r\nto-morrow. You will then enter on the ordeal you desire, but remember\r\nthat, in doing so, you must reduce Being as far as possible into Mind.\r\nThe senses must be mortified and subdued,--not the whisper of one\r\npassion heard. Thou mayst be master of the Cabala and the Chemistry; but\r\nthou must be master also over the Flesh and the Blood,--over Love\r\nand Vanity, Ambition and Hate. I will trust to find thee so. Fast and\r\nmeditate till we meet!”\r\n\r\nGlyndon crumpled the letter in his hand with a smile of disdain. What!\r\nmore drudgery,--more abstinence! Youth without love and pleasure! Ha,\r\nha! baffled Mejnour, thy pupil shall gain thy secrets without thine aid!\r\n\r\n“And Fillide! I passed her cottage in my way,--she blushed and sighed\r\nwhen I jested her about you, Excellency!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Paolo! I thank thee for so charming an introduction. Thine must\r\nbe a rare life.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Excellency, while we are young, nothing like adventure,--except\r\nlove, wine, and laughter!”\r\n\r\n“Very true. Farewell, Maestro Paolo; we will talk more with each other\r\nin a few days.”\r\n\r\nAll that morning Glyndon was almost overpowered with the new sentiment\r\nof happiness that had entered into him. He roamed into the woods, and\r\nhe felt a pleasure that resembled his earlier life of an artist, but a\r\npleasure yet more subtle and vivid, in the various colours of the\r\nautumn foliage. Certainly Nature seemed to be brought closer to him; he\r\ncomprehended better all that Mejnour had often preached to him of the\r\nmystery of sympathies and attractions. He was about to enter into the\r\nsame law as those mute children of the forests. He was to know THE\r\nRENEWAL OF LIFE; the seasons that chilled to winter should yet bring\r\nagain the bloom and the mirth of spring. Man’s common existence is as\r\none year to the vegetable world: he has his spring, his summer, his\r\nautumn, and winter,--but only ONCE. But the giant oaks round him go\r\nthrough a revolving series of verdure and youth, and the green of the\r\ncentenarian is as vivid in the beams of May as that of the sapling by\r\nits side. “Mine shall be your spring, but not your winter!” exclaimed\r\nthe aspirant.\r\n\r\nWrapped in these sanguine and joyous reveries, Glyndon, quitting the\r\nwoods, found himself amidst cultivated fields and vineyards to which his\r\nfootstep had not before wandered; and there stood, by the skirts of a\r\ngreen lane that reminded him of verdant England, a modest house,--half\r\ncottage, half farm. The door was open, and he saw a girl at work with\r\nher distaff. She looked up, uttered a slight cry, and, tripping gayly\r\ninto the lane to his side, he recognised the dark-eyed Fillide.\r\n\r\n“Hist!” she said, archly putting her finger to her lip; “do not speak\r\nloud,--my mother is asleep within; and I knew you would come to see me.\r\nIt is kind!”\r\n\r\nGlyndon, with a little embarrassment, accepted the compliment to his\r\nkindness, which he did not exactly deserve. “You have thought, then, of\r\nme, fair Fillide?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the girl, colouring, but with that frank, bold\r\ningenuousness, which characterises the females of Italy, especially\r\nof the lower class, and in the southern provinces,--“oh, yes! I have\r\nthought of little else. Paolo said he knew you would visit me.”\r\n\r\n“And what relation is Paolo to you?”\r\n\r\n“None; but a good friend to us all. My brother is one of his band.”\r\n\r\n“One of his band!--a robber?”\r\n\r\n“We of the mountains do not call a mountaineer ‘a robber,’ signor.”\r\n\r\n“I ask pardon. Do you not tremble sometimes for your brother’s life? The\r\nlaw--”\r\n\r\n“Law never ventures into these defiles. Tremble for him! No. My father\r\nand grandsire were of the same calling. I often wish I were a man!”\r\n\r\n“By these lips, I am enchanted that your wish cannot be realised.”\r\n\r\n“Fie, signor! And do you really love me?”\r\n\r\n“With my whole heart!”\r\n\r\n“And I thee!” said the girl, with a candour that seemed innocent, as she\r\nsuffered him to clasp her hand.\r\n\r\n“But,” she added, “thou wilt soon leave us; and I--” She stopped short,\r\nand the tears stood in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was something dangerous in this, it must be confessed. Certainly\r\nFillide had not the seraphic loveliness of Viola; but hers was a beauty\r\nthat equally at least touched the senses. Perhaps Glyndon had never\r\nreally loved Viola; perhaps the feelings with which she had inspired\r\nhim were not of that ardent character which deserves the name of love.\r\nHowever that be, he thought, as he gazed on those dark eyes, that he had\r\nnever loved before.\r\n\r\n“And couldst thou not leave thy mountains?” he whispered, as he drew yet\r\nnearer to her.\r\n\r\n“Dost thou ask me?” she said, retreating, and looking him steadfastly\r\nin the face. “Dost thou know what we daughters of the mountains are? You\r\ngay, smooth cavaliers of cities seldom mean what you speak. With you,\r\nlove is amusement; with us, it is life. Leave these mountains! Well! I\r\nshould not leave my nature.”\r\n\r\n“Keep thy nature ever,--it is a sweet one.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sweet while thou art true; stern, if thou art faithless. Shall I\r\ntell thee what I--what the girls of this country are? Daughters of men\r\nwhom you call robbers, we aspire to be the companions of our lovers or\r\nour husbands. We love ardently; we own it boldly. We stand by your side\r\nin danger; we serve you as slaves in safety: we never change, and we\r\nresent change. You may reproach, strike us, trample us as a dog,--we\r\nbear all without a murmur; betray us, and no tiger is more relentless.\r\nBe true, and our hearts reward you; be false, and our hands revenge!\r\nDost thou love me now?”\r\n\r\nDuring this speech the Italian’s countenance had most eloquently aided\r\nher words,--by turns soft, frank, fierce,--and at the last question she\r\ninclined her head humbly, and stood, as in fear of his reply, before\r\nhim. The stern, brave, wild spirit, in which what seemed unfeminine\r\nwas yet, if I may so say, still womanly, did not recoil, it rather\r\ncaptivated Glyndon. He answered readily, briefly, and freely,\r\n“Fillide,--yes!”\r\n\r\nOh, “yes!” forsooth, Clarence Glyndon! Every light nature answers “yes”\r\n lightly to such a question from lips so rosy! Have a care,--have a care!\r\nWhy the deuce, Mejnour, do you leave your pupil of four-and-twenty to\r\nthe mercy of these wild cats-a-mountain! Preach fast, and abstinence,\r\nand sublime renunciation of the cheats of the senses! Very well in\r\nyou, sir, Heaven knows how many ages old; but at four-and-twenty, your\r\nHierophant would have kept you out of Fillide’s way, or you would have\r\nhad small taste for the Cabala.\r\n\r\nAnd so they stood, and talked, and vowed, and whispered, till the girl’s\r\nmother made some noise within the house, and Fillide bounded back to the\r\ndistaff, her finger once more on her lip.\r\n\r\n“There is more magic in Fillide than in Mejnour,” said Glyndon to\r\nhimself, walking gayly home; “yet on second thoughts, I know not if I\r\nquite so well like a character so ready for revenge. But he who has the\r\nreal secret can baffle even the vengeance of a woman, and disarm all\r\ndanger!”\r\n\r\nSirrah! dost thou even already meditate the possibility of treason?\r\nOh, well said Zanoni, “to pour pure water into the muddy well does but\r\ndisturb the mud.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.VII.\r\n\r\n     Cernis, custodia qualis\r\n     Vestibulo sedeat? facies quae limina servet?\r\n     “Aeneid,” lib. vi. 574.\r\n\r\n     (See you what porter sits within the vestibule?--what face\r\n     watches at the threshold?)\r\n\r\nAnd it is profound night. All is at rest within the old castle,--all is\r\nbreathless under the melancholy stars. Now is the time. Mejnour with his\r\naustere wisdom,--Mejnour the enemy to love; Mejnour, whose eye will read\r\nthy heart, and refuse thee the promised secrets because the sunny face\r\nof Fillide disturbs the lifeless shadow that he calls repose,--Mejnour\r\ncomes to-morrow! Seize the night! Beware of fear! Never, or this hour!\r\nSo, brave youth,--brave despite all thy errors,--so, with a steady\r\npulse, thy hand unlocks once more the forbidden door.\r\n\r\nHe placed his lamp on the table beside the book, which still lay there\r\nopened; he turned over the leaves, but could not decipher their meaning\r\ntill he came to the following passage:--\r\n\r\n“When, then, the pupil is thus initiated and prepared, let him open the\r\ncasement, light the lamps, and bathe his temples with the elixir. He\r\nmust beware how he presume yet to quaff the volatile and fiery spirit.\r\nTo taste till repeated inhalations have accustomed the frame gradually\r\nto the ecstatic liquid, is to know not life, but death.”\r\n\r\nHe could penetrate no farther into the instructions; the cipher again\r\nchanged. He now looked steadily and earnestly round the chamber. The\r\nmoonlight came quietly through the lattice as his hand opened it,\r\nand seemed, as it rested on the floor, and filled the walls, like the\r\npresence of some ghostly and mournful Power. He ranged the mystic lamps\r\n(nine in number) round the centre of the room, and lighted them one by\r\none. A flame of silvery and azure tints sprung up from each, and lighted\r\nthe apartment with a calm and yet most dazzling splendour; but presently\r\nthis light grew more soft and dim, as a thin, grey cloud, like a mist,\r\ngradually spread over the room; and an icy thrill shot through the heart\r\nof the Englishman, and quickly gathered over him like the coldness\r\nof death. Instinctively aware of his danger, he tottered, though with\r\ndifficulty, for his limbs seemed rigid and stone-like, to the shelf that\r\ncontained the crystal vials; hastily he inhaled the spirit, and laved\r\nhis temples with the sparkling liquid. The same sensation of vigour\r\nand youth, and joy and airy lightness, that he had felt in the morning,\r\ninstantaneously replaced the deadly numbness that just before had\r\ninvaded the citadel of life. He stood, with his arms folded on his bosom\r\nerect and dauntless, to watch what should ensue.\r\n\r\nThe vapour had now assumed almost the thickness and seeming consistency\r\nof a snow-cloud; the lamps piercing it like stars. And now he distinctly\r\nsaw shapes, somewhat resembling in outline those of the human form,\r\ngliding slowly and with regular evolutions through the cloud. They\r\nappeared bloodless; their bodies were transparent, and contracted or\r\nexpanded like the folds of a serpent. As they moved in majestic order,\r\nhe heard a low sound--the ghost, as it were, of voice--which each caught\r\nand echoed from the other; a low sound, but musical, which seemed the\r\nchant of some unspeakably tranquil joy. None of these apparitions heeded\r\nhim. His intense longing to accost them, to be of them, to make one of\r\nthis movement of aerial happiness,--for such it seemed to him,--made him\r\nstretch forth his arms and seek to cry aloud, but only an inarticulate\r\nwhisper passed his lips; and the movement and the music went on the same\r\nas if the mortal were not there. Slowly they glided round and aloft,\r\ntill, in the same majestic order, one after one, they floated through\r\nthe casement and were lost in the moonlight; then, as his eyes followed\r\nthem, the casement became darkened with some object undistinguishable at\r\nthe first gaze, but which sufficed mysteriously to change into ineffable\r\nhorror the delight he had before experienced. By degrees this object\r\nshaped itself to his sight. It was as that of a human head covered with\r\na dark veil through which glared, with livid and demoniac fire, eyes\r\nthat froze the marrow of his bones. Nothing else of the face was\r\ndistinguishable,--nothing but those intolerable eyes; but his terror,\r\nthat even at the first seemed beyond nature to endure, was increased a\r\nthousand-fold, when, after a pause, the phantom glided slowly into the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe cloud retreated from it as it advanced; the bright lamps grew wan,\r\nand flickered restlessly as at the breath of its presence. Its form was\r\nveiled as the face, but the outline was that of a female; yet it moved\r\nnot as move even the ghosts that simulate the living. It seemed rather\r\nto crawl as some vast misshapen reptile; and pausing, at length it\r\ncowered beside the table which held the mystic volume, and again fixed\r\nits eyes through the filmy veil on the rash invoker. All fancies, the\r\nmost grotesque, of monk or painter in the early North, would have failed\r\nto give to the visage of imp or fiend that aspect of deadly malignity\r\nwhich spoke to the shuddering nature in those eyes alone. All else\r\nso dark,--shrouded, veiled and larva-like. But that burning glare so\r\nintense, so livid, yet so living, had in it something that was almost\r\nHUMAN in its passion of hate and mockery,--something that served to\r\nshow that the shadowy Horror was not all a spirit, but partook of\r\nmatter enough, at least, to make it more deadly and fearful an enemy to\r\nmaterial forms. As, clinging with the grasp of agony to the wall,--his\r\nhair erect, his eyeballs starting, he still gazed back upon that\r\nappalling gaze,--the Image spoke to him: his soul rather than his ear\r\ncomprehended the words it said.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast entered the immeasurable region. I am the Dweller of the\r\nThreshold. What wouldst thou with me? Silent? Dost thou fear me? Am\r\nI not thy beloved? Is it not for me that thou hast rendered up the\r\ndelights of thy race? Wouldst thou be wise? Mine is the wisdom of the\r\ncountless ages. Kiss me, my mortal lover.” And the Horror crawled near\r\nand nearer to him; it crept to his side, its breath breathed upon his\r\ncheek! With a sharp cry he fell to the earth insensible, and knew no\r\nmore till, far in the noon of the next day, he opened his eyes and found\r\nhimself in his bed,--the glorious sun streaming through his lattice,\r\nand the bandit Paolo by his side, engaged in polishing his carbine, and\r\nwhistling a Calabrian love-air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.VIII.\r\n\r\n     Thus man pursues his weary calling,\r\n     And wrings the hard life from the sky,\r\n     While happiness unseen is falling\r\n     Down from God’s bosom silently.\r\n     --Schiller.\r\n\r\nIn one of those islands whose history the imperishable literature and\r\nrenown of Athens yet invest with melancholy interest, and on which\r\nNature, in whom “there is nothing melancholy,” still bestows a glory of\r\nscenery and climate equally radiant for the freeman or the\r\nslave,--the Ionian, the Venetian, the Gaul, the Turk, or the restless\r\nBriton,--Zanoni had fixed his bridal home. There the air carries with it\r\nthe perfumes of the plains for miles along the blue, translucent deep.\r\n(See Dr. Holland’s “Travels to the Ionian Isles,” etc., page 18.) Seen\r\nfrom one of its green sloping heights, the island he had selected seemed\r\none delicious garden. The towers and turrets of its capital gleaming\r\namidst groves of oranges and lemons; vineyards and olive-woods filling\r\nup the valleys, and clambering along the hill-sides; and villa, farm,\r\nand cottage covered with luxuriant trellises of dark-green leaves and\r\npurple fruit. For there the prodigal beauty yet seems half to justify\r\nthose graceful superstitions of a creed that, too enamoured of earth,\r\nrather brought the deities to man, than raised the man to their less\r\nalluring and less voluptuous Olympus.\r\n\r\nAnd still to the fishermen, weaving yet their antique dances on the\r\nsand; to the maiden, adorning yet, with many a silver fibula, her glossy\r\ntresses under the tree that overshadows her tranquil cot,--the same\r\nGreat Mother that watched over the wise of Samos, the democracy of\r\nCorcyra, the graceful and deep-taught loveliness of Miletus, smiles\r\nas graciously as of yore. For the North, philosophy and freedom are\r\nessentials to human happiness; in the lands which Aphrodite rose from\r\nthe waves to govern, as the Seasons, hand in hand, stood to welcome her\r\non the shores, Nature is all sufficient. (Homeric Hymn.)\r\n\r\nThe isle which Zanoni had selected was one of the loveliest in that\r\ndivine sea. His abode, at some distance from the city, but near one of\r\nthe creeks on the shore, belonged to a Venetian, and, though small, had\r\nmore of elegance than the natives ordinarily cared for. On the seas, and\r\nin sight, rode his vessel. His Indians, as before, ministered in\r\nmute gravity to the service of the household. No spot could be more\r\nbeautiful,--no solitude less invaded. To the mysterious knowledge of\r\nZanoni, to the harmless ignorance of Viola, the babbling and garish\r\nworld of civilised man was alike unheeded. The loving sky and the lovely\r\nearth are companions enough to Wisdom and to Ignorance while they love.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have before said, there was nothing in the visible\r\noccupations of Zanoni that betrayed a cultivator of the occult sciences,\r\nhis habits were those of a man who remembers or reflects. He loved\r\nto roam alone, chiefly at dawn, or at night, when the moon was clear\r\n(especially in each month, at its rise and full), miles and miles away\r\nover the rich inlands of the island, and to cull herbs and flowers,\r\nwhich he hoarded with jealous care. Sometimes, at the dead of night,\r\nViola would wake by an instinct that told her he was not by her side,\r\nand, stretching out her arms, find that the instinct had not deceived\r\nher. But she early saw that he was reserved on his peculiar habits; and\r\nif at times a chill, a foreboding, a suspicious awe crept over her, she\r\nforebore to question him.\r\n\r\nBut his rambles were not always unaccompanied,--he took pleasure in\r\nexcursions less solitary. Often, when the sea lay before them like\r\na lake, the barren dreariness of the opposite coast of Cephallenia\r\ncontrasting the smiling shores on which they dwelt, Viola and himself\r\nwould pass days in cruising slowly around the coast, or in visits to\r\nthe neighbouring isles. Every spot of the Greek soil, “that fair\r\nFable-Land,” seemed to him familiar; and as he conversed of the past and\r\nits exquisite traditions, he taught Viola to love the race from which\r\nhave descended the poetry and the wisdom of the world. There was much in\r\nZanoni, as she knew him better, that deepened the fascination in which\r\nViola was from the first enthralled. His love for herself was so tender,\r\nso vigilant, and had that best and most enduring attribute, that it\r\nseemed rather grateful for the happiness in its own cares than vain of\r\nthe happiness it created. His habitual mood with all who approached him\r\nwas calm and gentle, almost to apathy. An angry word never passed his\r\nlips,--an angry gleam never shot from his eyes. Once they had been\r\nexposed to the danger not uncommon in those then half-savage lands. Some\r\npirates who infested the neighbouring coasts had heard of the arrival\r\nof the strangers, and the seamen Zanoni employed had gossiped of their\r\nmaster’s wealth. One night, after Viola had retired to rest, she was\r\nawakened by a slight noise below. Zanoni was not by her side; she\r\nlistened in some alarm. Was that a groan that came upon her ear? She\r\nstarted up, she went to the door; all was still. A footstep now slowly\r\napproached, and Zanoni entered calm as usual, and seemed unconscious of\r\nher fears.\r\n\r\nThe next morning three men were found dead at the threshold of the\r\nprincipal entrance, the door of which had been forced. They were\r\nrecognised in the neighbourhood as the most sanguinary and terrible\r\nmarauders of the coasts,--men stained with a thousand murders, and who\r\nhad never hitherto failed in any attempt to which the lust of rapine\r\nhad impelled them. The footsteps of many others were tracked to the\r\nseashore. It seemed that their accomplices must have fled on the death\r\nof their leaders. But when the Venetian Proveditore, or authority, of\r\nthe island, came to examine into the matter, the most unaccountable\r\nmystery was the manner in which these ruffians had met their fate.\r\nZanoni had not stirred from the apartment in which he ordinarily pursued\r\nhis chemical studies. None of the servants had even been disturbed from\r\ntheir slumbers. No marks of human violence were on the bodies of the\r\ndead. They died, and made no sign. From that moment Zanoni’s house--nay,\r\nthe whole vicinity--was sacred. The neighbouring villages, rejoiced\r\nto be delivered from a scourge, regarded the stranger as one whom the\r\nPagiana (or Virgin) held under her especial protection.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the lively Greeks around, facile to all external impressions,\r\nand struck with the singular and majestic beauty of the man who knew\r\ntheir language as a native, whose voice often cheered them in their\r\nhumble sorrows, and whose hand was never closed to their wants,\r\nlong after he had left their shore preserved his memory by grateful\r\ntraditions, and still point to the lofty platanus beneath which they had\r\noften seen him seated, alone and thoughtful, in the heats of noon. But\r\nZanoni had haunts less open to the gaze than the shade of the platanus.\r\nIn that isle there are the bituminous springs which Herodotus has\r\ncommemorated. Often at night, the moon, at least, beheld him emerging\r\nfrom the myrtle and cystus that clothe the hillocks around the marsh\r\nthat imbeds the pools containing the inflammable materia, all the\r\nmedical uses of which, as applied to the nerves of organic life, modern\r\nscience has not yet perhaps explored. Yet more often would he pass\r\nhis hours in a cavern, by the loneliest part of the beach, where the\r\nstalactites seem almost arranged by the hand of art, and which the\r\nsuperstition of the peasants associates, in some ancient legends, with\r\nthe numerous and almost incessant earthquakes to which the island is so\r\nsingularly subjected.\r\n\r\nWhatever the pursuits that instigated these wanderings and favoured\r\nthese haunts, either they were linked with, or else subordinate to, one\r\nmain and master desire, which every fresh day passed in the sweet human\r\ncompany of Viola confirmed and strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe scene that Glyndon had witnessed in his trance was faithful to\r\ntruth. And some little time after the date of that night, Viola\r\nwas dimly aware that an influence, she knew not of what nature, was\r\nstruggling to establish itself over her happy life. Visions indistinct\r\nand beautiful, such as those she had known in her earlier days, but more\r\nconstant and impressive, began to haunt her night and day when Zanoni\r\nwas absent, to fade in his presence, and seem less fair than THAT.\r\nZanoni questioned her eagerly and minutely of these visitations, but\r\nseemed dissatisfied, and at times perplexed, by her answers.\r\n\r\n“Tell me not,” he said, one day, “of those unconnected images, those\r\nevolutions of starry shapes in a choral dance, or those delicious\r\nmelodies that seem to thee of the music and the language of the distant\r\nspheres. Has no ONE shape been to thee more distinct and more beautiful\r\nthan the rest,--no voice uttering, or seeming to utter, thine own\r\ntongue, and whispering to thee of strange secrets and solemn knowledge?”\r\n\r\n“No; all is confused in these dreams, whether of day or night; and when\r\nat the sound of thy footsteps I recover, my memory retains nothing but\r\na vague impression of happiness. How different--how cold--to the rapture\r\nof hanging on thy smile, and listening to thy voice, when it says, ‘I\r\nlove thee!’”\r\n\r\n“Yet, how is it that visions less fair than these once seemed to thee\r\nso alluring? How is it that they then stirred thy fancies and filled\r\nthy heart? Once thou didst desire a fairy-land, and now thou seemest so\r\ncontented with common life.”\r\n\r\n“Have I not explained it to thee before? Is it common life, then, to\r\nlove, and to live with the one we love? My true fairy-land is won! Speak\r\nto me of no other.”\r\n\r\nAnd so night surprised them by the lonely beach; and Zanoni, allured\r\nfrom his sublimer projects, and bending over that tender face, forgot\r\nthat, in the Harmonious Infinite which spread around, there were other\r\nworlds than that one human heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.IX.\r\n\r\n     There is a principle of the soul, superior to all nature, through\r\n     which we are capable of surpassing the order and systems of the\r\n     world.  When the soul is elevated to natures better than itself,\r\n     THEN it is entirely separated from subordinate natures, exchanges\r\n     this for another life, and, deserting the order of things with\r\n     which it was connected, links and mingles itself with another.\r\n     --Iamblichus.\r\n\r\n“Adon-Ai! Adon-Ai!--appear, appear!”\r\n\r\nAnd in the lonely cave, whence once had gone forth the oracles of\r\na heathen god, there emerged from the shadows of fantastic rocks a\r\nluminous and gigantic column, glittering and shifting. It resembled the\r\nshining but misty spray which, seen afar off, a fountain seems to send\r\nup on a starry night. The radiance lit the stalactites, the crags,\r\nthe arches of the cave, and shed a pale and tremulous splendour on the\r\nfeatures of Zanoni.\r\n\r\n“Son of Eternal Light,” said the invoker, “thou to whose knowledge,\r\ngrade after grade, race after race, I attained at last, on the\r\nbroad Chaldean plains; thou from whom I have drawn so largely of the\r\nunutterable knowledge that yet eternity alone can suffice to drain; thou\r\nwho, congenial with myself, so far as our various beings will permit,\r\nhast been for centuries my familiar and my friend,--answer me and\r\ncounsel!”\r\n\r\nFrom the column there emerged a shape of unimaginable glory. Its\r\nface was that of a man in its first youth, but solemn, as with the\r\nconsciousness of eternity and the tranquillity of wisdom; light, like\r\nstarbeams, flowed through its transparent veins; light made its limbs\r\nthemselves, and undulated, in restless sparkles, through the waves of\r\nits dazzling hair. With its arms folded on its breast, it stood distant\r\na few feet from Zanoni, and its low voice murmured gently, “My counsels\r\nwere sweet to thee once; and once, night after night, thy soul could\r\nfollow my wings through the untroubled splendours of the Infinite. Now\r\nthou hast bound thyself back to the earth by its strongest chains, and\r\nthe attraction to the clay is more potent than the sympathies that drew\r\nto thy charms the Dweller of the Starbeam and the Air. When last thy\r\nsoul hearkened to me, the senses already troubled thine intellect and\r\nobscured thy vision. Once again I come to thee; but thy power even to\r\nsummon me to thy side is fading from thy spirit, as sunshine fades from\r\nthe wave when the winds drive the cloud between the ocean and the sky.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, Adon-Ai!” answered the seer, mournfully, “I know too well the\r\nconditions of the being which thy presence was wont to rejoice. I know\r\nthat our wisdom comes but from the indifference to the things of the\r\nworld which the wisdom masters. The mirror of the soul cannot reflect\r\nboth earth and heaven; and the one vanishes from the surface as the\r\nother is glassed upon its deeps. But it is not to restore me to that\r\nsublime abstraction in which the intellect, free and disembodied, rises,\r\nregion after region, to the spheres,--that once again, and with the\r\nagony and travail of enfeebled power I have called thee to mine aid. I\r\nlove; and in love I begin to live in the sweet humanities of another. If\r\nwise, yet in all which makes danger powerless against myself, or those\r\non whom I can gaze from the calm height of indifferent science, I am\r\nblind as the merest mortal to the destinies of the creature that makes\r\nmy heart beat with the passions which obscure my gaze.”\r\n\r\n“What matter!” answered Adon-Ai. “Thy love must be but a mockery of the\r\nname; thou canst not love as they do for whom there are death and the\r\ngrave. A short time,--like a day in thy incalculable life,--and the form\r\nthou dotest on is dust! Others of the nether world go hand in hand, each\r\nwith each, unto the tomb; hand in hand they ascend from the worm to new\r\ncycles of existence. For thee, below are ages; for her, but hours. And\r\nfor her and thee--O poor, but mighty one!--will there be even a joint\r\nhereafter! Through what grades and heavens of spiritualised being will\r\nher soul have passed when thou, the solitary loiterer, comest from the\r\nvapours of the earth to the gates of light!”\r\n\r\n“Son of the Starbeam, thinkest thou that this thought is not with me\r\nforever; and seest thou not that I have invoked thee to hearken and\r\nminister to my design? Readest thou not my desire and dream to raise the\r\nconditions of her being to my own? Thou, Adon-Ai, bathing the celestial\r\njoy that makes thy life in the oceans of eternal splendour,--thou,\r\nsave by the sympathies of knowledge, canst conjecture not what I,\r\nthe offspring of mortals, feel--debarred yet from the objects of the\r\ntremendous and sublime ambition that first winged my desires above the\r\nclay--when I see myself compelled to stand in this low world alone. I\r\nhave sought amongst my tribe for comrades, and in vain. At last I have\r\nfound a mate. The wild bird and the wild beast have theirs; and my\r\nmastery over the malignant tribes of terror can banish their larvae from\r\nthe path that shall lead her upward, till the air of eternity fits the\r\nframe for the elixir that baffles death.”\r\n\r\n“And thou hast begun the initiation, and thou art foiled! I know it.\r\nThou hast conjured to her sleep the fairest visions; thou hast invoked\r\nthe loveliest children of the air to murmur their music to her trance,\r\nand her soul heeds them not, and, returning to the earth, escapes from\r\ntheir control. Blind one, wherefore? canst thou not perceive? Because\r\nin her soul all is love. There is no intermediate passion with which the\r\nthings thou wouldst charm to her have association and affinities. Their\r\nattraction is but to the desires and cravings of the INTELLECT. What\r\nhave they with the PASSION that is of earth, and the HOPE that goes\r\ndirect to heaven?”\r\n\r\n“But can there be no medium--no link--in which our souls, as our hearts,\r\ncan be united, and so mine may have influence over her own?”\r\n\r\n“Ask me not,--thou wilt not comprehend me!”\r\n\r\n“I adjure thee!--speak!”\r\n\r\n“When two souls are divided, knowest thou not that a third in which both\r\nmeet and live is the link between them!”\r\n\r\n“I do comprehend thee, Adon-Ai,” said Zanoni, with a light of more human\r\njoy upon his face than it had ever before been seen to wear; “and if my\r\ndestiny, which here is dark to mine eyes, vouchsafes to me the happy lot\r\nof the humble,--if ever there be a child that I may clasp to my bosom\r\nand call my own--”\r\n\r\n“And is it to be man at last, that thou hast aspired to be more than\r\nman?”\r\n\r\n“But a child,--a second Viola!” murmured Zanoni, scarcely heeding the\r\nSon of Light; “a young soul fresh from heaven, that I may rear from the\r\nfirst moment it touches earth,--whose wings I may train to follow mine\r\nthrough the glories of creation; and through whom the mother herself may\r\nbe led upward over the realm of death!”\r\n\r\n“Beware,--reflect! Knowest thou not that thy darkest enemy dwells in the\r\nReal? Thy wishes bring thee near and nearer to humanity.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, humanity is sweet!” answered Zanoni.\r\n\r\nAnd as the seer spoke, on the glorious face of Adon-Ai there broke a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.X.\r\n\r\n     Aeterna aeternus tribuit, mortalia confert\r\n     Mortalis; divina Deus, peritura caducus.\r\n     “Aurel. Prud. contra Symmachum,” lib. ii.\r\n\r\n     (The Eternal gives eternal things, the Mortal gathers mortal\r\n     things:  God, that which is divine, and the perishable that which\r\n     is perishable.)\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM THE LETTERS OF ZANONI TO MEJNOUR.\r\n\r\nLetter 1.\r\n\r\nThou hast not informed me of the progress of thy pupil; and I fear that\r\nso differently does circumstance shape the minds of the generations to\r\nwhich we are descended, from the intense and earnest children of the\r\nearlier world, that even thy most careful and elaborate guidance would\r\nfail, with loftier and purer natures than that of the neophyte thou hast\r\nadmitted within thy gates. Even that third state of being, which the\r\nIndian sage (The Brahmins, speaking of Brahm, say, “To the Omniscient\r\nthe three modes of being--sleep, waking, and trance--are not;”\r\n distinctly recognising trance as a third and coequal condition of\r\nbeing.) rightly recognises as being between the sleep and the waking,\r\nand describes imperfectly by the name of TRANCE, is unknown to the\r\nchildren of the Northern world; and few but would recoil to indulge it,\r\nregarding its peopled calm as maya and delusion of the mind. Instead of\r\nripening and culturing that airy soil, from which Nature, duly known,\r\ncan evoke fruits so rich and flowers so fair, they strive but to exclude\r\nit from their gaze; they esteem that struggle of the intellect from\r\nmen’s narrow world to the spirit’s infinite home, as a disease which the\r\nleech must extirpate with pharmacy and drugs, and know not even that it\r\nis from this condition of their being, in its most imperfect and infant\r\nform, that poetry, music, art--all that belong to an Idea of Beauty\r\nto which neither SLEEPING nor WAKING can furnish archetype and actual\r\nsemblance--take their immortal birth. When we, O Mejnour in the far\r\ntime, were ourselves the neophytes and aspirants, we were of a class\r\nto which the actual world was shut and barred. Our forefathers had no\r\nobject in life but knowledge. From the cradle we were predestined and\r\nreared to wisdom as to a priesthood. We commenced research where modern\r\nConjecture closes its faithless wings. And with us, those were common\r\nelements of science which the sages of to-day disdain as wild\r\nchimeras, or despair of as unfathomable mysteries. Even the fundamental\r\nprinciples, the large yet simple theories of electricity and magnetism,\r\nrest obscure and dim in the disputes of their blinded schools; yet,\r\neven in our youth, how few ever attained to the first circle of the\r\nbrotherhood, and, after wearily enjoying the sublime privileges they\r\nsought, they voluntarily abandoned the light of the sun, and sunk,\r\nwithout effort, to the grave, like pilgrims in a trackless desert,\r\noverawed by the stillness of their solitude, and appalled by the absence\r\nof a goal. Thou, in whom nothing seems to live BUT THE DESIRE TO KNOW;\r\nthou, who, indifferent whether it leads to weal or to woe, lendest\r\nthyself to all who would tread the path of mysterious science, a human\r\nbook, insensate to the precepts it enounces,--thou hast ever sought,\r\nand often made additions to our number. But to these have only been\r\nvouchsafed partial secrets; vanity and passion unfitted them for the\r\nrest; and now, without other interest than that of an experiment in\r\nscience, without love, and without pity, thou exposest this new soul\r\nto the hazards of the tremendous ordeal! Thou thinkest that a zeal\r\nso inquisitive, a courage so absolute and dauntless, may suffice to\r\nconquer, where austerer intellect and purer virtue have so often failed.\r\nThou thinkest, too, that the germ of art that lies in the painter’s\r\nmind, as it comprehends in itself the entire embryo of power and beauty,\r\nmay be expanded into the stately flower of the Golden Science. It is a\r\nnew experiment to thee. Be gentle with thy neophyte, and if his nature\r\ndisappoint thee in the first stages of the process, dismiss him back to\r\nthe Real while it is yet time to enjoy the brief and outward life which\r\ndwells in the senses, and closes with the tomb. And as I thus admonish\r\nthee, O Mejnour, wilt thou smile at my inconsistent hopes? I, who have\r\nso invariably refused to initiate others into our mysteries,--I begin at\r\nlast to comprehend why the great law, which binds man to his kind, even\r\nwhen seeking most to set himself aloof from their condition, has made\r\nthy cold and bloodless science the link between thyself and thy race;\r\nwhy, THOU has sought converts and pupils; why, in seeing life after life\r\nvoluntarily dropping from our starry order, thou still aspirest to\r\nrenew the vanished, and repair the lost; why, amidst thy calculations,\r\nrestless and unceasing as the wheels of Nature herself, thou recoilest\r\nfrom the THOUGHT TO BE ALONE! So with myself; at last I, too, seek a\r\nconvert, an equal,--I, too, shudder to be alone! What thou hast warned\r\nme of has come to pass. Love reduces all things to itself. Either must I\r\nbe drawn down to the nature of the beloved, or hers must be lifted to\r\nmy own. As whatever belongs to true Art has always necessarily had\r\nattraction for US, whose very being is in the ideal whence Art descends,\r\nso in this fair creature I have learned, at last, the secret that bound\r\nme to her at the first glance. The daughter of music,--music, passing\r\ninto her being, became poetry. It was not the stage that attracted her,\r\nwith its hollow falsehoods; it was the land in her own fancy which\r\nthe stage seemed to centre and represent. There the poetry found a\r\nvoice,--there it struggled into imperfect shape; and then (that land\r\ninsufficient for it) it fell back upon itself. It coloured her thoughts,\r\nit suffused her soul; it asked not words, it created not things; it gave\r\nbirth but to emotions, and lavished itself on dreams. At last came love;\r\nand there, as a river into the sea, it poured its restless waves, to\r\nbecome mute and deep and still,--the everlasting mirror of the heavens.\r\n\r\nAnd is it not through this poetry which lies within her that she may\r\nbe led into the large poetry of the universe! Often I listen to her\r\ncareless talk, and find oracles in its unconscious beauty, as we find\r\nstrange virtues in some lonely flower. I see her mind ripening under my\r\neyes; and in its fair fertility what ever-teeming novelties of thought!\r\nO Mejnour! how many of our tribe have unravelled the laws of the\r\nuniverse,--have solved the riddles of the exterior nature, and deduced\r\nthe light from darkness! And is not the POET, who studies nothing but\r\nthe human heart, a greater philosopher than all? Knowledge and atheism\r\nare incompatible. To know Nature is to know that there must be a God.\r\nBut does it require this to examine the method and architecture of\r\ncreation? Methinks, when I look upon a pure mind, however ignorant and\r\nchildlike, that I see the August and Immaterial One more clearly than in\r\nall the orbs of matter which career at His bidding through space.\r\n\r\nRightly is it the fundamental decree of our order, that we must impart\r\nour secrets only to the pure. The most terrible part of the ordeal is\r\nin the temptations that our power affords to the criminal. If it were\r\npossible that a malevolent being could attain to our faculties, what\r\ndisorder it might introduce into the globe! Happy that it is NOT\r\npossible; the malevolence would disarm the power. It is in the purity of\r\nViola that I rely, as thou more vainly hast relied on the courage or the\r\ngenius of thy pupils. Bear me witness, Mejnour! Never since the distant\r\nday in which I pierced the Arcana of our knowledge, have I ever sought\r\nto make its mysteries subservient to unworthy objects; though, alas! the\r\nextension of our existence robs us of a country and a home; though the\r\nlaw that places all science, as all art, in the abstraction from the\r\nnoisy passions and turbulent ambition of actual life, forbids us to\r\ninfluence the destinies of nations, for which Heaven selects ruder and\r\nblinder agencies; yet, wherever have been my wanderings, I have sought\r\nto soften distress, and to convert from sin. My power has been hostile\r\nonly to the guilty; and yet with all our lore, how in each step we are\r\nreduced to be but the permitted instruments of the Power that vouchsafes\r\nour own, but only to direct it. How all our wisdom shrinks into nought,\r\ncompared with that which gives the meanest herb its virtues, and peoples\r\nthe smallest globule with its appropriate world. And while we are\r\nallowed at times to influence the happiness of others, how mysteriously\r\nthe shadows thicken round our own future doom! We cannot be prophets\r\nto ourselves! With what trembling hope I nurse the thought that I may\r\npreserve to my solitude the light of a living smile!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nExtracts from Letter II.\r\n\r\nDeeming myself not pure enough to initiate so pure a heart, I invoke to\r\nher trance those fairest and most tender inhabitants of space that have\r\nfurnished to poetry, which is the instinctive guess into creation, the\r\nideas of the Glendoveer and Sylph. And these were less pure than her own\r\nthoughts, and less tender than her own love! They could not raise her\r\nabove her human heart, for THAT has a heaven of its own.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nI have just looked on her in sleep,--I have heard her breathe my name.\r\nAlas! that which is so sweet to others has its bitterness to me; for\r\nI think how soon the time may come when that sleep will be without a\r\ndream,--when the heart that dictates the name will be cold, and the\r\nlips that utter it be dumb. What a twofold shape there is in love! If we\r\nexamine it coarsely,--if we look but on its fleshy ties, its enjoyments\r\nof a moment, its turbulent fever and its dull reaction,--how strange it\r\nseems that this passion should be the supreme mover of the world; that\r\nit is this which has dictated the greatest sacrifices, and influenced\r\nall societies and all times; that to this the loftiest and loveliest\r\ngenius has ever consecrated its devotion; that, but for love, there\r\nwere no civilisation, no music, no poetry, no beauty, no life beyond the\r\nbrute’s.\r\n\r\nBut examine it in its heavenlier shape,--in its utter abnegation of\r\nself; in its intimate connection with all that is most delicate and\r\nsubtle in the spirit,--its power above all that is sordid in existence;\r\nits mastery over the idols of the baser worship; its ability to create\r\na palace of the cottage, an oasis in the desert, a summer in the\r\nIceland,--where it breathes, and fertilises, and glows; and the wonder\r\nrather becomes how so few regard it in its holiest nature. What the\r\nsensual call its enjoyments, are the least of its joys. True love is\r\nless a passion than a symbol. Mejnour, shall the time come when I can\r\nspeak to thee of Viola as a thing that was?\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nExtract from Letter III.\r\n\r\nKnowest thou that of late I have sometimes asked myself, “Is there no\r\nguilt in the knowledge that has so divided us from our race?” It is true\r\nthat the higher we ascend the more hateful seem to us the vices of the\r\nshort-lived creepers of the earth,--the more the sense of the goodness\r\nof the All-good penetrates and suffuses us, and the more immediately\r\ndoes our happiness seem to emanate from him. But, on the other hand, how\r\nmany virtues must lie dead in those who live in the world of death, and\r\nrefuse to die! Is not this sublime egotism, this state of abstraction\r\nand reverie,--this self-wrapped and self-dependent majesty of existence,\r\na resignation of that nobility which incorporates our own welfare, our\r\njoys, our hopes, our fears with others? To live on in no dread of foes,\r\nundegraded by infirmity, secure through the cares, and free from the\r\ndisease of flesh, is a spectacle that captivates our pride. And yet dost\r\nthou not more admire him who dies for another? Since I have loved her,\r\nMejnour, it seems almost cowardice to elude the grave which devours the\r\nhearts that wrap us in their folds. I feel it,--the earth grows upon\r\nmy spirit. Thou wert right; eternal age, serene and passionless, is a\r\nhappier boon than eternal youth, with its yearnings and desires. Until\r\nwe can be all spirit, the tranquillity of solitude must be indifference.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nExtracts from Letter IV.\r\n\r\nI have received thy communication. What! is it so? Has thy pupil\r\ndisappointed thee? Alas, poor pupil! But--\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n(Here follow comments on those passages in Glyndon’s life already known\r\nto the reader, or about to be made so, with earnest adjurations to\r\nMejnour to watch yet over the fate of his scholar.)\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nBut I cherish the same desire, with a warmer heart. My pupil! how the\r\nterrors that shall encompass thine ordeal warn me from the task! Once\r\nmore I will seek the Son of Light.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nYes; Adon-Ai, long deaf to my call, at last has descended to my vision,\r\nand left behind him the glory of his presence in the shape of Hope. Oh,\r\nnot impossible, Viola,--not impossible, that we yet may be united, soul\r\nwith soul!\r\n\r\nExtract from Letter V.--(Many months after the last.)\r\n\r\nMejnour, awake from thine apathy,--rejoice! A new soul will be born to\r\nthe world,--a new soul that shall call me father. Ah, if they for whom\r\nexist all the occupations and resources of human life,--if they can\r\nthrill with exquisite emotion at the thought of hailing again their own\r\nchildhood in the faces of their children; if in that birth they are born\r\nonce more into the holy Innocence which is the first state of existence;\r\nif they can feel that on man devolves almost an angel’s duty, when\r\nhe has a life to guide from the cradle, and a soul to nurture for the\r\nheaven,--what to me must be the rapture to welcome an inheritor of all\r\nthe gifts which double themselves in being shared! How sweet the power\r\nto watch, and to guard,--to instil the knowledge, to avert the evil,\r\nand to guide back the river of life in a richer and broader and deeper\r\nstream to the paradise from which it flows! And beside that river our\r\nsouls shall meet, sweet mother. Our child shall supply the sympathy that\r\nfails as yet; and what shape shall haunt thee, what terror shall dismay,\r\nwhen thy initiation is beside the cradle of thy child!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.XI.\r\n\r\n     They thus beguile the way\r\n     Untill the blustring storme is overblowne,\r\n     When weening to returne whence they did stray,\r\n     They cannot finde that path which first was showne,\r\n     But wander to and fro in waies unknowne.\r\n     --Spenser’s “Faerie Queene,” book i. canto i. st. x.\r\n\r\nYes, Viola, thou art another being than when, by the threshold of thy\r\nItalian home, thou didst follow thy dim fancies through the Land of\r\nShadow; or when thou didst vainly seek to give voice to an ideal beauty,\r\non the boards where illusion counterfeits earth and heaven for an\r\nhour, till the weary sense, awaking, sees but the tinsel and the\r\nscene-shifter. Thy spirit reposes in its own happiness. Its wanderings\r\nhave found a goal. In a moment there often dwells the sense of eternity;\r\nfor when profoundly happy, we know that it is impossible to die.\r\nWhenever the soul FEELS ITSELF, it feels everlasting life.\r\n\r\nThe initiation is deferred,--thy days and nights are left to no other\r\nvisions than those with which a contented heart enchants a guileless\r\nfancy. Glendoveers and Sylphs, pardon me if I question whether those\r\nvisions are not lovelier than yourselves.\r\n\r\nThey stand by the beach, and see the sun sinking into the sea. How long\r\nnow have they dwelt on that island? What matters!--it may be months, or\r\nyears--what matters! Why should I, or they, keep account of that happy\r\ntime? As in the dream of a moment ages may seem to pass, so shall we\r\nmeasure transport or woe,--by the length of the dream, or the number of\r\nemotions that the dream involves?\r\n\r\nThe sun sinks slowly down; the air is arid and oppressive; on the sea,\r\nthe stately vessel lies motionless; on the shore, no leaf trembles on\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nViola drew nearer to Zanoni. A presentiment she could not define made\r\nher heart beat more quickly; and, looking into his face, she was struck\r\nwith its expression: it was anxious, abstracted, perturbed. “This\r\nstillness awes me,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nZanoni did not seem to hear her. He muttered to himself, and his eyes\r\ngazed round restlessly. She knew not why, but that gaze, which seemed\r\nto pierce into space,--that muttered voice in some foreign\r\nlanguage--revived dimly her earlier superstitions. She was more fearful\r\nsince the hour when she knew that she was to be a mother. Strange crisis\r\nin the life of woman, and in her love! Something yet unborn begins\r\nalready to divide her heart with that which had been before its only\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\n“Look on me, Zanoni,” she said, pressing his hand.\r\n\r\nHe turned: “Thou art pale, Viola; thy hand trembles!”\r\n\r\n“It is true. I feel as if some enemy were creeping near us.”\r\n\r\n“And the instinct deceives thee not. An enemy is indeed at hand. I see\r\nit through the heavy air; I hear it through the silence: the Ghostly\r\nOne,--the Destroyer, the PESTILENCE! Ah, seest thou how the leaves swarm\r\nwith insects, only by an effort visible to the eye. They follow the\r\nbreath of the plague!” As he spoke, a bird fell from the boughs at\r\nViola’s feet; it fluttered, it writhed an instant, and was dead.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Viola!” cried Zanoni, passionately, “that is death. Dost thou not\r\nfear to die?”\r\n\r\n“To leave thee? Ah, yes!”\r\n\r\n“And if I could teach thee how Death may be defied; if I could arrest\r\nfor thy youth the course of time; if I could--”\r\n\r\nHe paused abruptly, for Viola’s eyes spoke only terror; her cheek and\r\nlips were pale.\r\n\r\n“Speak not thus,--look not thus,” she said, recoiling from him. “You\r\ndismay me. Ah, speak not thus, or I should tremble,--no, not for myself,\r\nbut for thy child.”\r\n\r\n“Thy child! But wouldst thou reject for thy child the same glorious\r\nboon?”\r\n\r\n“Zanoni!”\r\n\r\n“Well!”\r\n\r\n“The sun has sunk from our eyes, but to rise on those of others. To\r\ndisappear from this world is to live in the world afar. Oh, lover,--oh,\r\nhusband!” she continued, with sudden energy, “tell me that thou didst\r\nbut jest,--that thou didst but trifle with my folly! There is less\r\nterror in the pestilence than in thy words.”\r\n\r\nZanoni’s brow darkened; he looked at her in silence for some moments,\r\nand then said, almost severely,--\r\n\r\n“What hast thou known of me to distrust?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, pardon, pardon!--nothing!” cried Viola, throwing herself on his\r\nbreast, and bursting into tears. “I will not believe even thine own\r\nwords, if they seem to wrong thee!” He kissed the tears from her eyes,\r\nbut made no answer.\r\n\r\n“And ah!” she resumed, with an enchanting and child-like smile, “if thou\r\nwouldst give me a charm against the pestilence! see, I will take it from\r\nthee.” And she laid her hand on a small, antique amulet that he wore on\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\n“Thou knowest how often this has made me jealous of the past; surely\r\nsome love-gift, Zanoni? But no, thou didst not love the giver as thou\r\ndost me. Shall I steal thine amulet?”\r\n\r\n“Infant!” said Zanoni, tenderly; “she who placed this round my neck\r\ndeemed it indeed a charm, for she had superstitions like thyself; but\r\nto me it is more than the wizard’s spell,--it is the relic of a sweet\r\nvanished time when none who loved me could distrust.”\r\n\r\nHe said these words in a tone of such melancholy reproach that it went\r\nto the heart of Viola; but the tone changed into a solemnity which\r\nchilled back the gush of her feelings as he resumed: “And this, Viola,\r\none day, perhaps, I will transfer from my breast to thine; yes, whenever\r\nthou shalt comprehend me better,--WHENEVER THE LAWS OF OUR BEING SHALL\r\nBE THE SAME!”\r\n\r\nHe moved on gently. They returned slowly home; but fear still was in the\r\nheart of Viola, though she strove to shake it off. Italian and Catholic\r\nshe was, with all the superstitions of land and sect. She stole to\r\nher chamber and prayed before a little relic of San Gennaro, which\r\nthe priest of her house had given to her in childhood, and which had\r\naccompanied her in all her wanderings. She had never deemed it\r\npossible to part with it before. Now, if there was a charm against the\r\npestilence, did she fear the pestilence for herself? The next morning,\r\nwhen he awoke, Zanoni found the relic of the saint suspended with his\r\nmystic amulet round his neck.\r\n\r\n“Ah! thou wilt have nothing to fear from the pestilence now,” said\r\nViola, between tears and smiles; “and when thou wouldst talk to me again\r\nas thou didst last night, the saint shall rebuke thee.”\r\n\r\nWell, Zanoni, can there ever indeed be commune of thought and spirit,\r\nexcept with equals?\r\n\r\nYes, the plague broke out,--the island home must be abandoned. Mighty\r\nSeer, THOU HAST NO POWER TO SAVE THOSE WHOM THOU LOVEST! Farewell, thou\r\nbridal roof!--sweet resting-place from care, farewell! Climates as soft\r\nmay greet ye, O lovers,--skies as serene, and waters as blue and calm;\r\nbut THAT TIME,--can it ever more return? Who shall say that the heart\r\ndoes not change with the scene,--the place where we first dwelt with the\r\nbeloved one? Every spot THERE has so many memories which the place only\r\ncan recall. The past that haunts it seems to command such constancy in\r\nthe future. If a thought less kind, less trustful, enter within us, the\r\nsight of a tree under which a vow has been exchanged, a tear has\r\nbeen kissed away, restores us again to the hours of the first divine\r\nillusion. But in a home where nothing speaks of the first nuptials,\r\nwhere there is no eloquence of association, no holy burial-places of\r\nemotions, whose ghosts are angels!--yes, who that has gone through the\r\nsad history of affection will tell us that the heart changes not with\r\nthe scene! Blow fair, ye favouring winds; cheerily swell, ye sails; away\r\nfrom the land where death has come to snatch the sceptre of Love! The\r\nshores glide by; new coasts succeed to the green hills and orange-groves\r\nof the Bridal Isle. From afar now gleam in the moonlight the columns,\r\nyet extant, of a temple which the Athenian dedicated to wisdom; and,\r\nstanding on the bark that bounded on in the freshening gale, the votary\r\nwho had survived the goddess murmured to himself,--\r\n\r\n“Has the wisdom of ages brought me no happier hours than those common\r\nto the shepherd and the herdsman, with no world beyond their village, no\r\naspiration beyond the kiss and the smile of home?”\r\n\r\nAnd the moon, resting alike over the ruins of the temple of the\r\ndeparted creed, over the hut of the living peasant, over the immemorial\r\nmountain-top, and the perishable herbage that clothed its sides, seemed\r\nto smile back its answer of calm disdain to the being who, perchance,\r\nmight have seen the temple built, and who, in his inscrutable existence,\r\nmight behold the mountain shattered from its base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V. -- THE EFFECTS OF THE ELIXIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.I.\r\n\r\n     Frommet’s den Schleier aufzuheben,\r\n     Wo das nahe Schreckness droht?\r\n     Nur das Irrthum ist das Leben\r\n     Und das Wissen ist der Tod,\r\n\r\n     --Schiller, Kassandro.\r\n\r\n     Delusion is the life we live\r\n     And knowledge death; oh wherefore, then,\r\n     To sight the coming evils give\r\n     And lift the veil of Fate to Man?\r\n\r\n     Zwei Seelen wohnen, ach! in meiner Brust.\r\n\r\n     (Two souls dwell, alas! in my breast.)\r\n\r\n     ....\r\n\r\n     Was stehst du so, und blickst erstaunt hinaus?\r\n\r\n     (Why standest thou so, and lookest out astonished?)\r\n\r\n     --“Faust.”\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that we left Master Paolo by the bedside of\r\nGlyndon; and as, waking from that profound slumber, the recollections of\r\nthe past night came horribly back to his mind, the Englishman uttered a\r\ncry, and covered his face with his hands.\r\n\r\n“Good morrow, Excellency!” said Paolo, gayly. “Corpo di Bacco, you have\r\nslept soundly!”\r\n\r\nThe sound of this man’s voice, so lusty, ringing, and healthful, served\r\nto scatter before it the phantasma that yet haunted Glyndon’s memory.\r\n\r\nHe rose erect in his bed. “And where did you find me? Why are you here?”\r\n\r\n“Where did I find you!” repeated Paolo, in surprise,--“in your bed, to\r\nbe sure. Why am I here!--because the Padrone bade me await your waking,\r\nand attend your commands.”\r\n\r\n“The Padrone, Mejnour!--is he arrived?”\r\n\r\n“Arrived and departed, signor. He has left this letter for you.”\r\n\r\n“Give it me, and wait without till I am dressed.”\r\n\r\n“At your service. I have bespoke an excellent breakfast: you must be\r\nhungry. I am a very tolerable cook; a monk’s son ought to be! You will\r\nbe startled at my genius in the dressing of fish. My singing, I\r\ntrust, will not disturb you. I always sing while I prepare a salad; it\r\nharmonises the ingredients.” And slinging his carbine over his shoulder,\r\nPaolo sauntered from the room, and closed the door.\r\n\r\nGlyndon was already deep in the contents of the following letter:--\r\n\r\n“When I first received thee as my pupil, I promised Zanoni, if convinced\r\nby thy first trials that thou couldst but swell, not the number of our\r\norder, but the list of the victims who have aspired to it in vain, I\r\nwould not rear thee to thine own wretchedness and doom,--I would dismiss\r\nthee back to the world. I fulfil my promise. Thine ordeal has been the\r\neasiest that neophyte ever knew. I asked for nothing but abstinence from\r\nthe sensual, and a brief experiment of thy patience and thy faith. Go\r\nback to thine own world; thou hast no nature to aspire to ours!\r\n\r\n“It was I who prepared Paolo to receive thee at the revel. It was I who\r\ninstigated the old beggar to ask thee for alms. It was I who left open\r\nthe book that thou couldst not read without violating my command. Well,\r\nthou hast seen what awaits thee at the threshold of knowledge. Thou hast\r\nconfronted the first foe that menaces him whom the senses yet grasp and\r\ninthrall. Dost thou wonder that I close upon thee the gates forever?\r\nDost thou not comprehend, at last, that it needs a soul tempered and\r\npurified and raised, not by external spells, but by its own sublimity\r\nand valour, to pass the threshold and disdain the foe? Wretch! all\r\nmy silence avails nothing for the rash, for the sensual,--for him who\r\ndesires our secrets but to pollute them to gross enjoyments and selfish\r\nvice. How have the imposters and sorcerers of the earlier times perished\r\nby their very attempt to penetrate the mysteries that should purify, and\r\nnot deprave! They have boasted of the Philosopher’s Stone, and died in\r\nrags; of the immortal elixir, and sunk to their grave, grey before their\r\ntime. Legends tell you that the fiend rent them into fragments. Yes;\r\nthe fiend of their own unholy desires and criminal designs! What they\r\ncoveted, thou covetest; and if thou hadst the wings of a seraph thou\r\ncouldst soar not from the slough of thy mortality. Thy desire for\r\nknowledge, but petulant presumption; thy thirst for happiness, but\r\nthe diseased longing for the unclean and muddied waters of corporeal\r\npleasure; thy very love, which usually elevates even the mean, a passion\r\nthat calculates treason amidst the first glow of lust. THOU one of us;\r\nthou a brother of the August Order; thou an Aspirant to the Stars that\r\nshine in the Shemaia of the Chaldean lore! The eagle can raise but the\r\neaglet to the sun. I abandon thee to thy twilight!\r\n\r\n“But, alas for thee, disobedient and profane! thou hast inhaled the\r\nelixir; thou hast attracted to thy presence a ghastly and remorseless\r\nfoe. Thou thyself must exorcise the phantom thou hast raised. Thou must\r\nreturn to the world; but not without punishment and strong effort canst\r\nthou regain the calm and the joy of the life thou hast left behind.\r\nThis, for thy comfort, will I tell thee: he who has drawn into his frame\r\neven so little of the volatile and vital energy of the aerial juices as\r\nthyself, has awakened faculties that cannot sleep,--faculties that may\r\nyet, with patient humility, with sound faith, and the courage that\r\nis not of the body like thine, but of the resolute and virtuous mind,\r\nattain, if not to the knowledge that reigns above, to high achievement\r\nin the career of men. Thou wilt find the restless influence in all that\r\nthou wouldst undertake. Thy heart, amidst vulgar joys will aspire to\r\nsomething holier; thy ambition, amidst coarse excitement, to something\r\nbeyond thy reach. But deem not that this of itself will suffice for\r\nglory. Equally may the craving lead thee to shame and guilt. It is but\r\nan imperfect and new-born energy which will not suffer thee to repose.\r\nAs thou directest it, must thou believe it to be the emanation of thine\r\nevil genius or thy good.\r\n\r\n“But woe to thee! insect meshed in the web in which thou hast entangled\r\nlimbs and wings! Thou hast not only inhaled the elixir, thou hast\r\nconjured the spectre; of all the tribes of the space, no foe is so\r\nmalignant to man,--and thou hast lifted the veil from thy gaze. I cannot\r\nrestore to thee the happy dimness of thy vision. Know, at least, that\r\nall of us--the highest and the wisest--who have, in sober truth, passed\r\nbeyond the threshold, have had, as our first fearful task, to master and\r\nsubdue its grisly and appalling guardian. Know that thou CANST deliver\r\nthyself from those livid eyes,--know that, while they haunt, they cannot\r\nharm, if thou resistest the thoughts to which they tempt, and the horror\r\nthey engender. DREAD THEM MOST WHEN THOU BEHOLDEST THEM NOT. And thus,\r\nson of the worm, we part! All that I can tell thee to encourage, yet to\r\nwarn and to guide, I have told thee in these lines. Not from me, from\r\nthyself has come the gloomy trial from which I yet trust thou wilt\r\nemerge into peace. Type of the knowledge that I serve, I withhold no\r\nlesson from the pure aspirant; I am a dark enigma to the general seeker.\r\nAs man’s only indestructible possession is his memory, so it is not in\r\nmine art to crumble into matter the immaterial thoughts that have sprung\r\nup within thy breast. The tyro might shatter this castle to the dust,\r\nand topple down the mountain to the plain. The master has no power to\r\nsay, ‘Exist no more,’ to one THOUGHT that his knowledge has inspired.\r\nThou mayst change the thoughts into new forms; thou mayst rarefy and\r\nsublimate it into a finer spirit,--but thou canst not annihilate that\r\nwhich has no home but in the memory, no substance but the idea. EVERY\r\nTHOUGHT IS A SOUL! Vainly, therefore, would I or thou undo the past,\r\nor restore to thee the gay blindness of thy youth. Thou must endure the\r\ninfluence of the elixir thou hast inhaled; thou must wrestle with the\r\nspectre thou hast invoked!”\r\n\r\nThe letter fell from Glyndon’s hand. A sort of stupor succeeded to the\r\nvarious emotions which had chased each other in the perusal,--a stupor\r\nresembling that which follows the sudden destruction of any ardent and\r\nlong-nursed hope in the human heart, whether it be of love, of avarice,\r\nof ambition. The loftier world for which he had so thirsted, sacrificed,\r\nand toiled, was closed upon him “forever,” and by his own faults of\r\nrashness and presumption. But Glyndon’s was not of that nature which\r\nsubmits long to condemn itself. His indignation began to kindle against\r\nMejnour, who owned he had tempted, and who now abandoned him,--abandoned\r\nhim to the presence of a spectre. The mystic’s reproaches stung rather\r\nthan humbled him. What crime had he committed to deserve language so\r\nharsh and disdainful? Was it so deep a debasement to feel pleasure in\r\nthe smile and the eyes of Fillide? Had not Zanoni himself confessed\r\nlove for Viola; had he not fled with her as his companion? Glyndon never\r\npaused to consider if there are no distinctions between one kind of\r\nlove and another. Where, too, was the great offence of yielding to a\r\ntemptation which only existed for the brave? Had not the mystic volume\r\nwhich Mejnour had purposely left open, bid him but “Beware of fear”? Was\r\nnot, then, every wilful provocative held out to the strongest influences\r\nof the human mind, in the prohibition to enter the chamber, in the\r\npossession of the key which excited his curiosity, in the volume which\r\nseemed to dictate the mode by which the curiosity was to be gratified?\r\nAs rapidly these thoughts passed over him, he began to consider the\r\nwhole conduct of Mejnour either as a perfidious design to entrap him to\r\nhis own misery, or as the trick of an imposter, who knew that he could\r\nnot realise the great professions he had made. On glancing again over\r\nthe more mysterious threats and warnings in Mejnour’s letter, they\r\nseemed to assume the language of mere parable and allegory,--the jargon\r\nof the Platonists and Pythagoreans. By little and little, he began to\r\nconsider that the very spectra he had seen--even that one phantom so\r\nhorrid in its aspect--were but the delusions which Mejnour’s science had\r\nenable him to raise. The healthful sunlight, filling up every cranny\r\nin his chamber, seemed to laugh away the terrors of the past night. His\r\npride and his resentment nerved his habitual courage; and when, having\r\nhastily dressed himself, he rejoined Paolo, it was with a flushed cheek\r\nand a haughty step.\r\n\r\n“So, Paolo,” said he, “the Padrone, as you call him, told you to expect\r\nand welcome me at your village feast?”\r\n\r\n“He did so by a message from a wretched old cripple. This surprised\r\nme at the time, for I thought he was far distant; but these great\r\nphilosophers make a joke of two or three hundred leagues.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you not tell me you had heard from Mejnour?”\r\n\r\n“Because the old cripple forbade me.”\r\n\r\n“Did you not see the man afterwards during the dance?”\r\n\r\n“No, Excellency.”\r\n\r\n“Humph!”\r\n\r\n“Allow me to serve you,” said Paolo, piling Glyndon’s plate, and then\r\nfilling his glass. “I wish, signor, now the Padrone is gone,--not,”\r\n added Paolo, as he cast rather a frightened and suspicious glance round\r\nthe room, “that I mean to say anything disrespectful of him,--I wish, I\r\nsay, now that he is gone, that you would take pity on yourself, and ask\r\nyour own heart what your youth was meant for? Not to bury yourself alive\r\nin these old ruins, and endanger body and soul by studies which I am\r\nsure no saint could approve of.”\r\n\r\n“Are the saints so partial, then, to your own occupations, Master\r\nPaolo?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” answered the bandit, a little confused, “a gentleman with plenty\r\nof pistoles in his purse need not, of necessity, make it his profession\r\nto take away the pistoles of other people! It is a different thing for\r\nus poor rogues. After all, too, I always devote a tithe of my gains\r\nto the Virgin; and I share the rest charitably with the poor. But eat,\r\ndrink, enjoy yourself; be absolved by your confessor for any little\r\npeccadilloes and don’t run too long scores at a time,--that’s my advice.\r\nYour health, Excellency! Pshaw, signor, fasting, except on the days\r\nprescribed to a good Catholic, only engenders phantoms.”\r\n\r\n“Phantoms!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the devil always tempts the empty stomach. To covet, to hate, to\r\nthieve, to rob, and to murder,--these are the natural desires of a man\r\nwho is famishing. With a full belly, signor, we are at peace with all\r\nthe world. That’s right; you like the partridge! Cospetto! when I myself\r\nhave passed two or three days in the mountains, with nothing from sunset\r\nto sunrise but a black crust and an onion, I grow as fierce as a wolf.\r\nThat’s not the worst, too. In these times I see little imps dancing\r\nbefore me. Oh, yes; fasting is as full of spectres as a field of\r\nbattle.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon thought there was some sound philosophy in the reasoning of\r\nhis companion; and certainly the more he ate and drank, the more the\r\nrecollection of the past night and of Mejnour’s desertion faded from his\r\nmind. The casement was open, the breeze blew, the sun shone,--all Nature\r\nwas merry; and merry as Nature herself grew Maestro Paolo. He talked\r\nof adventures, of travel, of women, with a hearty gusto that had its\r\ninfection. But Glyndon listened yet more complacently when Paolo turned\r\nwith an arch smile to praises of the eye, the teeth, the ankles, and the\r\nshape of the handsome Fillide.\r\n\r\nThis man, indeed, seemed the very personation of animal sensual life. He\r\nwould have been to Faust a more dangerous tempter than Mephistopheles.\r\nThere was no sneer on HIS lip at the pleasures which animated his voice.\r\nTo one awaking to a sense of the vanities in knowledge, this reckless\r\nignorant joyousness of temper was a worse corrupter than all the icy\r\nmockeries of a learned Fiend. But when Paolo took his leave, with a\r\npromise to return the next day, the mind of the Englishman again settled\r\nback to a graver and more thoughtful mood. The elixir seemed, in truth,\r\nto have left the refining effects Mejnour had ascribed to it. As Glyndon\r\npaced to and fro the solitary corridor, or, pausing, gazed upon the\r\nextended and glorious scenery that stretched below, high thoughts\r\nof enterprise and ambition--bright visions of glory--passed in rapid\r\nsuccession through his soul.\r\n\r\n“Mejnour denies me his science. Well,” said the painter, proudly, “he\r\nhas not robbed me of my art.”\r\n\r\nWhat! Clarence Glyndon, dost thou return to that from which thy career\r\ncommenced? Was Zanoni right after all?\r\n\r\nHe found himself in the chamber of the mystic; not a vessel,--not an\r\nherb! the solemn volume is vanished,--the elixir shall sparkle for him\r\nno more! But still in the room itself seems to linger the atmosphere of\r\na charm. Faster and fiercer it burns within thee, the desire to achieve,\r\nto create! Thou longest for a life beyond the sensual!--but the life\r\nthat is permitted to all genius,--that which breathes through the\r\nimmortal work, and endures in the imperishable name.\r\n\r\nWhere are the implements for thine art? Tush!--when did the true workman\r\never fail to find his tools? Thou art again in thine own chamber,--the\r\nwhite wall thy canvas, a fragment of charcoal for thy pencil. They\r\nsuffice, at least, to give outline to the conception that may otherwise\r\nvanish with the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe idea that thus excited the imagination of the artist was\r\nunquestionably noble and august. It was derived from that Egyptian\r\nceremonial which Diodorus has recorded,--the Judgment of the Dead by the\r\nLiving (Diod., lib. i.): when the corpse, duly embalmed, is placed by\r\nthe margin of the Acherusian Lake; and before it may be consigned to the\r\nbark which is to bear it across the waters to its final resting-place,\r\nit is permitted to the appointed judges to hear all accusations of the\r\npast life of the deceased, and, if proved, to deprive the corpse of the\r\nrites of sepulture.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously to himself, it was Mejnour’s description of this custom,\r\nwhich he had illustrated by several anecdotes not to be found in books,\r\nthat now suggested the design to the artist, and gave it reality and\r\nforce. He supposed a powerful and guilty king whom in life scarce a\r\nwhisper had dared to arraign, but against whom, now the breath was gone,\r\ncame the slave from his fetters, the mutilated victim from his dungeon,\r\nlivid and squalid as if dead themselves, invoking with parched lips the\r\njustice that outlives the grave.\r\n\r\nStrange fervour this, O artist! breaking suddenly forth from the mists\r\nand darkness which the occult science had spread so long over thy\r\nfancies,--strange that the reaction of the night’s terror and the day’s\r\ndisappointment should be back to thine holy art! Oh, how freely goes\r\nthe bold hand over the large outline! How, despite those rude materials,\r\nspeaks forth no more the pupil, but the master! Fresh yet from the\r\nglorious elixir, how thou givest to thy creatures the finer life denied\r\nto thyself!--some power not thine own writes the grand symbols on the\r\nwall. Behind rises the mighty sepulchre, on the building of which repose\r\nto the dead the lives of thousands had been consumed. There sit in a\r\nsemicircle the solemn judges. Black and sluggish flows the lake. There\r\nlies the mummied and royal dead. Dost thou quail at the frown on\r\nhis lifelike brow? Ha!--bravely done, O artist!--up rise the haggard\r\nforms!--pale speak the ghastly faces! Shall not Humanity after death\r\navenge itself on Power? Thy conception, Clarence Glyndon, is a sublime\r\ntruth; thy design promises renown to genius. Better this magic than the\r\ncharms of the volume and the vessel. Hour after hour has gone; thou hast\r\nlighted the lamp; night sees thee yet at thy labour. Merciful Heaven!\r\nwhat chills the atmosphere; why does the lamp grow wan; why does thy\r\nhair bristle? There!--there!--there! at the casement! It gazes on thee,\r\nthe dark, mantled, loathsome thing! There, with their devilish mockery\r\nand hateful craft, glare on thee those horrid eyes!\r\n\r\nHe stood and gazed,--it was no delusion. It spoke not, moved not, till,\r\nunable to bear longer that steady and burning look, he covered his face\r\nwith his hands. With a start, with a thrill, he removed them; he felt\r\nthe nearer presence of the nameless. There it cowered on the floor\r\nbeside his design; and lo! the figures seemed to start from the wall!\r\nThose pale accusing figures, the shapes he himself had raised, frowned\r\nat him, and gibbered. With a violent effort that convulsed his whole\r\nbeing, and bathed his body in the sweat of agony, the young man mastered\r\nhis horror. He strode towards the phantom; he endured its eyes; he\r\naccosted it with a steady voice; he demanded its purpose and defied its\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as a wind from a charnel, was heard its voice. What it said,\r\nwhat revealed, it is forbidden the lips to repeat, the hand to record.\r\nNothing save the subtle life that yet animated the frame to which\r\nthe inhalations of the elixir had given vigour and energy beyond the\r\nstrength of the strongest, could have survived that awful hour. Better\r\nto wake in the catacombs and see the buried rise from their cerements,\r\nand hear the ghouls, in their horrid orgies, amongst the festering\r\nghastliness of corruption, than to front those features when the veil\r\nwas lifted, and listen to that whispered voice!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nThe next day Glyndon fled from the ruined castle. With what hopes of\r\nstarry light had he crossed the threshold; with what memories to shudder\r\nevermore at the darkness did he look back at the frown of its time-worn\r\ntowers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.II.\r\n\r\n     Faust:  Wohin soll es nun gehm?\r\n     Mephist:  Wohin es Dir gefallt.\r\n     Wir sehn die kleine, dann die grosse Welt.\r\n     “Faust.”\r\n\r\n     (Faust:  Whither go now!\r\n     Mephist:  Whither it pleases thee.\r\n     We see the small world, then the great.)\r\n\r\nDraw your chair to the fireside, brush clean the hearth, and trim the\r\nlights. Oh, home of sleekness, order, substance, comfort! Oh, excellent\r\nthing art thou, Matter of Fact!\r\n\r\nIt is some time after the date of the last chapter. Here we are, not in\r\nmoonlit islands or mouldering castles, but in a room twenty-six feet by\r\ntwenty-two,--well carpeted, well cushioned, solid arm-chairs and eight\r\nsuch bad pictures, in such fine frames, upon the walls! Thomas Mervale,\r\nEsq., merchant, of London, you are an enviable dog!\r\n\r\nIt was the easiest thing in the world for Mervale, on returning from his\r\nContinental episode of life, to settle down to his desk,--his heart had\r\nbeen always there. The death of his father gave him, as a birthright,\r\na high position in a respectable though second-rate firm. To make this\r\nestablishment first-rate was an honourable ambition,--it was his! He had\r\nlately married, not entirely for money,--no! he was worldly rather than\r\nmercenary. He had no romantic ideas of love; but he was too sensible\r\na man not to know that a wife should be a companion,--not merely a\r\nspeculation. He did not care for beauty and genius, but he liked health\r\nand good temper, and a certain proportion of useful understanding. He\r\nchose a wife from his reason, not his heart, and a very good choice he\r\nmade. Mrs. Mervale was an excellent young woman,--bustling, managing,\r\neconomical, but affectionate and good. She had a will of her own, but\r\nwas no shrew. She had a great notion of the rights of a wife, and a\r\nstrong perception of the qualities that insure comfort. She would never\r\nhave forgiven her husband, had she found him guilty of the most passing\r\nfancy for another; but, in return, she had the most admirable sense of\r\npropriety herself. She held in abhorrence all levity, all flirtation,\r\nall coquetry,--small vices which often ruin domestic happiness, but\r\nwhich a giddy nature incurs without consideration. But she did not think\r\nit right to love a husband over much. She left a surplus of affection,\r\nfor all her relations, all her friends, some of her acquaintances, and\r\nthe possibility of a second marriage, should any accident happen to Mr.\r\nM. She kept a good table, for it suited their station; and her temper\r\nwas considered even, though firm; but she could say a sharp thing\r\nor two, if Mr. Mervale was not punctual to a moment. She was very\r\nparticular that he should change his shoes on coming home,--the carpets\r\nwere new and expensive. She was not sulky, nor passionate,--Heaven\r\nbless her for that!--but when displeased she showed it, administered a\r\ndignified rebuke, alluded to her own virtues, to her uncle who was an\r\nadmiral, and to the thirty thousand pounds which she had brought to the\r\nobject of her choice. But as Mr. Mervale was a good-humoured man, owned\r\nhis faults, and subscribed to her excellence, the displeasure was soon\r\nover.\r\n\r\nEvery household has its little disagreements, none fewer than that of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Mervale. Mrs. Mervale, without being improperly fond of\r\ndress, paid due attention to it. She was never seen out of her chamber\r\nwith papers in her hair, nor in that worst of dis-illusions,--a morning\r\nwrapper. At half-past eight every morning Mrs. Mervale was dressed\r\nfor the day,--that is, till she re-dressed for dinner,--her stays well\r\nlaced, her cap prim, her gowns, winter and summer, of a thick, handsome\r\nsilk. Ladies at that time wore very short waists; so did Mrs. Mervale.\r\nHer morning ornaments were a thick, gold chain, to which was suspended\r\na gold watch,--none of those fragile dwarfs of mechanism that look so\r\npretty and go so ill, but a handsome repeater which chronicled Father\r\nTime to a moment; also a mosaic brooch; also a miniature of her uncle,\r\nthe admiral, set in a bracelet. For the evening she had two handsome\r\nsets,--necklace, earrings, and bracelets complete,--one of amethysts,\r\nthe other topazes. With these, her costume for the most part was a\r\ngold-coloured satin and a turban, in which last her picture had been\r\ntaken. Mrs. Mervale had an aquiline nose, good teeth, fair hair, and\r\nlight eyelashes, rather a high complexion, what is generally called a\r\nfine bust; full cheeks; large useful feet made for walking; large, white\r\nhands with filbert nails, on which not a speck of dust had, even in\r\nchildhood, ever been known to a light. She looked a little older than\r\nshe really was; but that might arise from a certain air of dignity and\r\nthe aforesaid aquiline nose. She generally wore short mittens. She never\r\nread any poetry but Goldsmith’s and Cowper’s. She was not amused by\r\nnovels, though she had no prejudice against them. She liked a play and\r\na pantomime, with a slight supper afterwards. She did not like concerts\r\nnor operas. At the beginning of the winter she selected some book to\r\nread, and some piece of work to commence. The two lasted her till the\r\nspring, when, though she continued to work, she left off reading. Her\r\nfavourite study was history, which she read through the medium of Dr.\r\nGoldsmith. Her favourite author in the belles lettres was, of course,\r\nDr. Johnson. A worthier woman, or one more respected, was not to be\r\nfound, except in an epitaph!\r\n\r\nIt was an autumn night. Mr. and Mrs. Mervale, lately returned from an\r\nexcursion to Weymouth, are in the drawing-room,--“the dame sat on this\r\nside, the man sat on that.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I assure you, my dear, that Glyndon, with all his eccentricities,\r\nwas a very engaging, amiable fellow. You would certainly have liked\r\nhim,--all the women did.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Thomas, you will forgive the remark,--but that expression of\r\nyours, ‘all the WOMEN’--”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,--you are right. I meant to say that he was a general\r\nfavourite with your charming sex.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,--rather a frivolous character.”\r\n\r\n“Frivolous! no, not exactly; a little unsteady,--very odd, but certainly\r\nnot frivolous; presumptuous and headstrong in character, but modest and\r\nshy in his manners, rather too much so,--just what you like. However,\r\nto return; I am seriously uneasy at the accounts I have heard of him\r\nto-day. He has been living, it seems, a very strange and irregular life,\r\ntravelling from place to place, and must have spent already a great deal\r\nof money.”\r\n\r\n“Apropos of money,” said Mrs. Mervale; “I fear we must change our\r\nbutcher; he is certainly in league with the cook.”\r\n\r\n“That is a pity; his beef is remarkably fine. These London servants are\r\nas bad as the Carbonari. But, as I was saying, poor Glyndon--”\r\n\r\nHere a knock was heard at the door. “Bless me,” said Mrs. Mervale, “it\r\nis past ten! Who can that possibly be?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps your uncle, the admiral,” said the husband, with a slight\r\npeevishness in his accent. “He generally favours us about this hour.”\r\n\r\n“I hope, my love, that none of my relations are unwelcome visitors at\r\nyour house. The admiral is a most entertaining man, and his fortune is\r\nentirely at his own disposal.”\r\n\r\n“No one I respect more,” said Mr. Mervale, with emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe servant threw open the door, and announced Mr. Glyndon.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Glyndon!--what an extraordinary--” exclaimed Mrs. Mervale; but\r\nbefore she could conclude the sentence, Glyndon was in the room.\r\n\r\nThe two friends greeted each other with all the warmth of early\r\nrecollection and long absence. An appropriate and proud presentation\r\nto Mrs. Mervale ensued; and Mrs. Mervale, with a dignified smile, and\r\na furtive glance at his boots, bade her husband’s friend welcome to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nGlyndon was greatly altered since Mervale had seen him last. Though\r\nless than two years had elapsed since then, his fair complexion was more\r\nbronzed and manly. Deep lines of care, or thought, or dissipation, had\r\nreplaced the smooth contour of happy youth. To a manner once gentle\r\nand polished had succeeded a certain recklessness of mien, tone, and\r\nbearing, which bespoke the habits of a society that cared little for the\r\ncalm decorums of conventional ease. Still a kind of wild nobleness, not\r\nbefore apparent in him, characterised his aspect, and gave something of\r\ndignity to the freedom of his language and gestures.\r\n\r\n“So, then, you are settled, Mervale,--I need not ask you if you are\r\nhappy. Worth, sense, wealth, character, and so fair a companion deserve\r\nhappiness, and command it.”\r\n\r\n“Would you like some tea, Mr. Glyndon?” asked Mrs. Mervale, kindly.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,--no. I propose a more convivial stimulus to my old friend.\r\nWine, Mervale,--wine, eh!--or a bowl of old English punch. Your wife\r\nwill excuse us,--we will make a night of it!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Mervale drew back her chair, and tried not to look aghast. Glyndon\r\ndid not give his friend time to reply.\r\n\r\n“So at last I am in England,” he said, looking round the room, with\r\na slight sneer on his lips; “surely this sober air must have its\r\ninfluence; surely here I shall be like the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Have you been ill, Glyndon?”\r\n\r\n“Ill, yes. Humph! you have a fine house. Does it contain a spare room\r\nfor a solitary wanderer?”\r\n\r\nMr. Mervale glanced at his wife, and his wife looked steadily on the\r\ncarpet. “Modest and shy in his manners--rather too much so!” Mrs.\r\nMervale was in the seventh heaven of indignation and amaze!\r\n\r\n“My dear?” said Mr. Mervale at last, meekly and interogatingly.\r\n\r\n“My dear!” returned Mrs. Mervale, innocently and sourly.\r\n\r\n“We can make up a room for my old friend, Sarah?”\r\n\r\nThe old friend had sunk back on his chair, and, gazing intently on the\r\nfire, with his feet at ease upon the fender, seemed to have forgotten\r\nhis question.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mervale bit her lips, looked thoughtful, and at last coldly\r\nreplied, “Certainly, Mr. Mervale; your friends do right to make\r\nthemselves at home.”\r\n\r\nWith that she lighted a candle, and moved majestically from the room.\r\nWhen she returned, the two friends had vanished into Mr. Mervale’s\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nTwelve o’clock struck,--one o’clock, two! Thrice had Mrs. Mervale sent\r\ninto the room to know,--first, if they wanted anything; secondly, if Mr.\r\nGlyndon slept on a mattress or feather-bed; thirdly, to inquire if Mr.\r\nGlyndon’s trunk, which he had brought with him, should be unpacked. And\r\nto the answer to all these questions was added, in a loud voice from the\r\nvisitor,--a voice that pierced from the kitchen to the attic,--“Another\r\nbowl! stronger, if you please, and be quick with it!”\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Mervale appeared in the conjugal chamber, not penitent, nor\r\napologetic,--no, not a bit of it. His eyes twinkled, his cheek flushed,\r\nhis feet reeled; he sang,--Mr. Thomas Mervale positively sang!\r\n\r\n“Mr. Mervale! is it possible, sir--”\r\n\r\n“‘Old King Cole was a merry old soul--’”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Mervale! sir!--leave me alone, sir!”\r\n\r\n“‘And a merry old soul was he--’”\r\n\r\n“What an example to the servants!”\r\n\r\n“‘And he called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl--’”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t behave yourself, sir, I shall call--”\r\n\r\n“‘Call for his fiddlers three!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.III.\r\n\r\n     In der Welt weit\r\n     Aus der Einsamkeit\r\n     Wollen sie Dich locken.\r\n     --“Faust.”\r\n\r\n     (In the wide world, out of the solitude, will these allure thee.)\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at breakfast, Mrs. Mervale looked as if all the wrongs\r\nof injured woman sat upon her brow. Mr. Mervale seemed the picture of\r\nremorseful guilt and avenging bile. He said little, except to complain\r\nof headache, and to request the eggs to be removed from the table.\r\nClarence Glyndon--impervious, unconscious, unailing, impenitent--was in\r\nnoisy spirits, and talked for three.\r\n\r\n“Poor Mervale! he has lost the habit of good-fellowship, madam. Another\r\nnight or two, and he will be himself again!”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Mrs. Mervale, launching a premeditated sentence with more\r\nthan Johnsonian dignity, “permit me to remind you that Mr. Mervale is\r\nnow a married man, the destined father of a family, and the present\r\nmaster of a household.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely the reasons why I envy him so much. I myself have a great\r\nmind to marry. Happiness is contagious.”\r\n\r\n“Do you still take to painting?” asked Mervale, languidly, endeavouring\r\nto turn the tables on his guest.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; I have adopted your advice. No art, no ideal,--nothing loftier\r\nthan Commonplace for me now. If I were to paint again, I positively\r\nthink YOU would purchase my pictures. Make haste and finish your\r\nbreakfast, man; I wish to consult you. I have come to England to see\r\nafter my affairs. My ambition is to make money; your counsels and\r\nexperience cannot fail to assist me here.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you were soon disenchanted of your Philosopher’s Stone! You must\r\nknow, Sarah, that when I last left Glyndon, he was bent upon turning\r\nalchemist and magician.”\r\n\r\n“You are witty to-day, Mr. Mervale.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my honour it is true, I told you so before.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon rose abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Why revive those recollections of folly and presumption? Have I not\r\nsaid that I have returned to my native land to pursue the healthful\r\navocations of my kind! Oh, yes! what so healthful, so noble, so\r\nfitted to our nature, as what you call the Practical Life? If we\r\nhave faculties, what is their use, but to sell them to advantage! Buy\r\nknowledge as we do our goods; buy it at the cheapest market, sell it at\r\nthe dearest. Have you not breakfasted yet?”\r\n\r\nThe friends walked into the streets, and Mervale shrank from the irony\r\nwith which Glyndon complimented him on his respectability, his station,\r\nhis pursuits, his happy marriage, and his eight pictures in their\r\nhandsome frames. Formerly the sober Mervale had commanded an influence\r\nover his friend: HIS had been the sarcasm; Glyndon’s the irresolute\r\nshame at his own peculiarities. Now this position was reversed. There\r\nwas a fierce earnestness in Glyndon’s altered temper which awed and\r\nsilenced the quiet commonplace of his friend’s character. He seemed to\r\ntake a malignant delight in persuading himself that the sober life of\r\nthe world was contemptible and base.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed, “how right you were to tell me to marry respectably;\r\nto have a solid position; to live in decorous fear of the world and\r\none’s wife; and to command the envy of the poor, the good opinion of\r\nthe rich. You have practised what you preach. Delicious existence! The\r\nmerchant’s desk and the curtain lecture! Ha! ha! Shall we have another\r\nnight of it?”\r\n\r\nMervale, embarrassed and irritated, turned the conversation upon\r\nGlyndon’s affairs. He was surprised at the knowledge of the world which\r\nthe artist seemed to have suddenly acquired, surprised still more at\r\nthe acuteness and energy with which he spoke of the speculations most in\r\nvogue at the market. Yes; Glyndon was certainly in earnest: he desired\r\nto be rich and respectable,--and to make at least ten per cent for his\r\nmoney!\r\n\r\nAfter spending some days with the merchant, during which time he\r\ncontrived to disorganise all the mechanism of the house, to turn\r\nnight into day, harmony into discord, to drive poor Mrs. Mervale\r\nhalf-distracted, and to convince her husband that he was horribly\r\nhen-pecked, the ill-omened visitor left them as suddenly as he had\r\narrived. He took a house of his own; he sought the society of persons\r\nof substance; he devoted himself to the money-market; he seemed to\r\nhave become a man of business; his schemes were bold and colossal; his\r\ncalculations rapid and profound. He startled Mervale by his energy,\r\nand dazzled him by his success. Mervale began to envy him,--to be\r\ndiscontented with his own regular and slow gains. When Glyndon bought or\r\nsold in the funds, wealth rolled upon him like the tide of a sea; what\r\nyears of toil could not have done for him in art, a few months, by\r\na succession of lucky chances, did for him in speculation. Suddenly,\r\nhowever, he relaxed his exertions; new objects of ambition seemed to\r\nattract him. If he heard a drum in the streets, what glory like the\r\nsoldier’s? If a new poem were published, what renown like the poet’s?\r\nHe began works in literature, which promised great excellence, to throw\r\nthem aside in disgust. All at once he abandoned the decorous and formal\r\nsociety he had courted; he joined himself, with young and riotous\r\nassociates; he plunged into the wildest excesses of the great city,\r\nwhere Gold reigns alike over Toil and Pleasure. Through all he carried\r\nwith him a certain power and heat of soul. In all society he aspired\r\nto command,--in all pursuits to excel. Yet whatever the passion of the\r\nmoment, the reaction was terrible in its gloom. He sank, at times, into\r\nthe most profound and the darkest reveries. His fever was that of a mind\r\nthat would escape memory,--his repose, that of a mind which the memory\r\nseizes again, and devours as a prey. Mervale now saw little of him; they\r\nshunned each other. Glyndon had no confidant, and no friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.IV.\r\n\r\n     Ich fuhle Dich mir nahe;\r\n     Die Einsamkeit belebt;\r\n     Wie uber seinen Welten\r\n     Der Unsichtbare schwebt.\r\n     Uhland.\r\n\r\n     (I feel thee near to me,\r\n     The loneliness takes life,--As over its world\r\n     The Invisible hovers.)\r\n\r\nFrom this state of restlessness and agitation rather than continuous\r\naction, Glyndon was aroused by a visitor who seemed to exercise the most\r\nsalutary influence over him. His sister, an orphan with himself, had\r\nresided in the country with her aunt. In the early years of hope and\r\nhome he had loved this girl, much younger than himself, with all a\r\nbrother’s tenderness. On his return to England, he had seemed to forget\r\nher existence. She recalled herself to him on her aunt’s death by\r\na touching and melancholy letter: she had now no home but his,--no\r\ndependence save on his affection; he wept when he read it, and was\r\nimpatient till Adela arrived.\r\n\r\nThis girl, then about eighteen, concerned beneath a gentle and calm\r\nexterior much of the romance or enthusiasm that had, at her own age,\r\ncharacterised her brother. But her enthusiasm was of a far purer order,\r\nand was restrained within proper bounds, partly by the sweetness of a\r\nvery feminine nature, and partly by a strict and methodical education.\r\nShe differed from him especially in a timidity of character which\r\nexceeded that usual at her age, but which the habit of self-command\r\nconcealed no less carefully than that timidity itself concealed the\r\nromance I have ascribed to her.\r\n\r\nAdela was not handsome: she had the complexion and the form of delicate\r\nhealth; and too fine an organisation of the nerves rendered her\r\nsusceptible to every impression that could influence the health of the\r\nframe through the sympathy of the mind. But as she never complained, and\r\nas the singular serenity of her manners seemed to betoken an\r\nequanimity of temperament which, with the vulgar, might have passed for\r\nindifference, her sufferings had so long been borne unnoticed that it\r\nceased to be an effort to disguise them. Though, as I have said, not\r\nhandsome, her countenance was interesting and pleasing; and there\r\nwas that caressing kindness, that winning charm about her smile, her\r\nmanners, her anxiety to please, to comfort, and to soothe which went at\r\nonce to the heart, and made her lovely,--because so loving.\r\n\r\nSuch was the sister whom Glyndon had so long neglected, and whom he\r\nnow so cordially welcomed. Adela had passed many years a victim to\r\nthe caprices, and a nurse to the maladies, of a selfish and exacting\r\nrelation. The delicate and generous and respectful affection of her\r\nbrother was no less new to her than delightful. He took pleasure in the\r\nhappiness he created; he gradually weaned himself from other society;\r\nhe felt the charm of home. It is not surprising, then, that this\r\nyoung creature, free and virgin from every more ardent attachment,\r\nconcentrated all her grateful love on this cherished and protecting\r\nrelative. Her study by day, her dream by night, was to repay him for\r\nhis affection. She was proud of his talents, devoted to his welfare;\r\nthe smallest trifle that could interest him swelled in her eyes to the\r\ngravest affairs of life. In short, all the long-hoarded enthusiasm,\r\nwhich was her perilous and only heritage, she invested in this one\r\nobject of her holy tenderness, her pure ambition.\r\n\r\nBut in proportion as Glyndon shunned those excitements by which he had\r\nso long sought to occupy his time or distract his thoughts, the gloom\r\nof his calmer hours became deeper and more continuous. He ever and\r\nespecially dreaded to be alone; he could not bear his new companion to\r\nbe absent from his eyes: he rode with her, walked with her, and it was\r\nwith visible reluctance, which almost partook of horror, that he retired\r\nto rest at an hour when even revel grows fatigued. This gloom was not\r\nthat which could be called by the soft name of melancholy,--it was far\r\nmore intense; it seemed rather like despair. Often after a silence as of\r\ndeath--so heavy, abstracted, motionless, did it appear--he would start\r\nabruptly, and cast hurried glances around him,--his limbs trembling, his\r\nlips livid, his brows bathed in dew. Convinced that some secret sorrow\r\npreyed upon his mind, and would consume his health, it was the dearest\r\nas the most natural desire of Adela to become his confidant and\r\nconsoler. She observed, with the quick tact of the delicate, that he\r\ndisliked her to seem affected by, or even sensible of, his darker moods.\r\nShe schooled herself to suppress her fears and her feelings. She would\r\nnot ask his confidence,--she sought to steal into it. By little and\r\nlittle she felt that she was succeeding. Too wrapped in his own strange\r\nexistence to be acutely observant of the character of others, Glyndon\r\nmistook the self-content of a generous and humble affection for\r\nconstitutional fortitude; and this quality pleased and soothed him. It\r\nis fortitude that the diseased mind requires in the confidant whom\r\nit selects as its physician. And how irresistible is that desire to\r\ncommunicate! How often the lonely man thought to himself, “My heart\r\nwould be lightened of its misery, if once confessed!” He felt, too, that\r\nin the very youth, the inexperience, the poetical temperament of Adela,\r\nhe could find one who would comprehend and bear with him better than\r\nany sterner and more practical nature. Mervale would have looked on his\r\nrevelations as the ravings of madness, and most men, at best, as the\r\nsicklied chimeras, the optical delusions, of disease. Thus gradually\r\npreparing himself for that relief for which he yearned, the moment for\r\nhis disclosure arrived thus:--\r\n\r\nOne evening, as they sat alone together, Adela, who inherited some\r\nportion of her brother’s talent in art, was employed in drawing, and\r\nGlyndon, rousing himself from meditations less gloomy than usual, rose,\r\nand affectionately passing his arm round her waist, looked over her as\r\nshe sat. An exclamation of dismay broke from his lips,--he snatched the\r\ndrawing from her hand: “What are you about?--what portrait is this?”\r\n\r\n“Dear Clarence, do you not remember the original?--it is a copy from\r\nthat portrait of our wise ancestor which our poor mother used to say\r\nso strongly resembled you. I thought it would please you if I copied it\r\nfrom memory.”\r\n\r\n“Accursed was the likeness!” said Glyndon, gloomily. “Guess you not the\r\nreason why I have shunned to return to the home of my fathers!--because\r\nI dreaded to meet that portrait!--because--because--but pardon me; I\r\nalarm you!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no,--no, Clarence, you never alarm me when you speak: only when you\r\nare silent! Oh, if you thought me worthy of your trust; oh, if you had\r\ngiven me the right to reason with you in the sorrows that I yearn to\r\nshare!”\r\n\r\nGlyndon made no answer, but paced the room for some moments with\r\ndisordered strides. He stopped at last, and gazed at her earnestly.\r\n“Yes, you, too, are his descendant; you know that such men have lived\r\nand suffered; you will not mock me,--you will not disbelieve! Listen!\r\nhark!--what sound is that?”\r\n\r\n“But the wind on the house-top, Clarence,--but the wind.”\r\n\r\n“Give me your hand; let me feel its living clasp; and when I have told\r\nyou, never revert to the tale again. Conceal it from all: swear that it\r\nshall die with us,--the last of our predestined race!”\r\n\r\n“Never will I betray your trust; I swear it,--never!” said Adela,\r\nfirmly; and she drew closer to his side. Then Glyndon commenced his\r\nstory. That which, perhaps, in writing, and to minds prepared to\r\nquestion and disbelieve, may seem cold and terrorless, became far\r\ndifferent when told by those blanched lips, with all that truth of\r\nsuffering which convinces and appalls. Much, indeed, he concealed,\r\nmuch he involuntarily softened; but he revealed enough to make his\r\ntale intelligible and distinct to his pale and trembling listener. “At\r\ndaybreak,” he said, “I left that unhallowed and abhorred abode. I had\r\none hope still,--I would seek Mejnour through the world. I would force\r\nhim to lay at rest the fiend that haunted my soul. With this intent I\r\njourneyed from city to city. I instituted the most vigilant researches\r\nthrough the police of Italy. I even employed the services of the\r\nInquisition at Rome, which had lately asserted its ancient powers in the\r\ntrial of the less dangerous Cagliostro. All was in vain; not a trace of\r\nhim could be discovered. I was not alone, Adela.” Here Glyndon paused a\r\nmoment, as if embarrassed; for in his recital, I need scarcely say that\r\nhe had only indistinctly alluded to Fillide, whom the reader may\r\nsurmise to be his companion. “I was not alone, but the associate of\r\nmy wanderings was not one in whom my soul could confide,--faithful and\r\naffectionate, but without education, without faculties to comprehend me,\r\nwith natural instincts rather than cultivated reason; one in whom the\r\nheart might lean in its careless hours, but with whom the mind could\r\nhave no commune, in whom the bewildered spirit could seek no guide. Yet\r\nin the society of this person the demon troubled me not. Let me\r\nexplain yet more fully the dread conditions of its presence. In coarse\r\nexcitement, in commonplace life, in the wild riot, in the fierce excess,\r\nin the torpid lethargy of that animal existence which we share with the\r\nbrutes, its eyes were invisible, its whisper was unheard. But whenever\r\nthe soul would aspire, whenever the imagination kindled to the loftier\r\nends, whenever the consciousness of our proper destiny struggled against\r\nthe unworthy life I pursued, then, Adela--then, it cowered by my side\r\nin the light of noon, or sat by my bed,--a Darkness visible through the\r\nDark. If, in the galleries of Divine Art, the dreams of my youth woke\r\nthe early emulation,--if I turned to the thoughts of sages; if the\r\nexample of the great, if the converse of the wise, aroused the silenced\r\nintellect, the demon was with me as by a spell. At last, one evening, at\r\nGenoa, to which city I had travelled in pursuit of the mystic, suddenly,\r\nand when least expected, he appeared before me. It was the time of the\r\nCarnival. It was in one of those half-frantic scenes of noise and revel,\r\ncall it not gayety, which establish a heathen saturnalia in the midst\r\nof a Christian festival. Wearied with the dance, I had entered a room in\r\nwhich several revellers were seated, drinking, singing, shouting; and\r\nin their fantastic dresses and hideous masks, their orgy seemed scarcely\r\nhuman. I placed myself amongst them, and in that fearful excitement of\r\nthe spirits which the happy never know, I was soon the most riotous of\r\nall. The conversation fell on the Revolution of France, which had\r\nalways possessed for me an absorbing fascination. The masks spoke of the\r\nmillennium it was to bring on earth, not as philosophers rejoicing in\r\nthe advent of light, but as ruffians exulting in the annihilation of\r\nlaw. I know not why it was, but their licentious language infected\r\nmyself; and, always desirous to be foremost in every circle, I soon\r\nexceeded even these rioters in declamations on the nature of the liberty\r\nwhich was about to embrace all the families of the globe,--a liberty\r\nthat should pervade not only public legislation, but domestic life; an\r\nemancipation from every fetter that men had forged for themselves. In\r\nthe midst of this tirade one of the masks whispered me,--\r\n\r\n“‘Take care. One listens to you who seems to be a spy!’\r\n\r\n“My eyes followed those of the mask, and I observed a man who took\r\nno part in the conversation, but whose gaze was bent upon me. He was\r\ndisguised like the rest, yet I found by a general whisper that none had\r\nobserved him enter. His silence, his attention, had alarmed the fears of\r\nthe other revellers,--they only excited me the more. Rapt in my subject,\r\nI pursued it, insensible to the signs of those about me; and, addressing\r\nmyself only to the silent mask who sat alone, apart from the group, I\r\ndid not even observe that, one by one, the revellers slunk off, and that\r\nI and the silent listener were left alone, until, pausing from my heated\r\nand impetuous declamations, I said,--\r\n\r\n“‘And you, signor,--what is your view of this mighty era? Opinion\r\nwithout persecution; brotherhood without jealousy; love without\r\nbondage--’\r\n\r\n“‘And life without God,’ added the mask as I hesitated for new images.\r\n\r\n“The sound of that well-known voice changed the current of my thought. I\r\nsprang forward, and cried,--\r\n\r\n“‘Imposter or Fiend, we meet at last!’\r\n\r\n“The figure rose as I advanced, and, unmasking, showed the features of\r\nMejnour. His fixed eye, his majestic aspect, awed and repelled me. I\r\nstood rooted to the ground.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ he said solemnly, ‘we meet, and it is this meeting that I have\r\nsought. How hast thou followed my admonitions! Are these the scenes in\r\nwhich the Aspirant for the Serene Science thinks to escape the Ghastly\r\nEnemy? Do the thoughts thou hast uttered--thoughts that would strike all\r\norder from the universe--express the hopes of the sage who would rise to\r\nthe Harmony of the Eternal Spheres?’\r\n\r\n“‘It is thy fault,--it is thine!’ I exclaimed. ‘Exorcise the phantom!\r\nTake the haunting terror from my soul!’\r\n\r\n“Mejnour looked at me a moment with a cold and cynical disdain which\r\nprovoked at once my fear and rage, and replied,--\r\n\r\n“‘No; fool of thine own senses! No; thou must have full and entire\r\nexperience of the illusions to which the Knowledge that is without Faith\r\nclimbs its Titan way. Thou pantest for this Millennium,--thou shalt\r\nbehold it! Thou shalt be one of the agents of the era of Light and\r\nReason. I see, while I speak, the Phantom thou fliest, by thy side; it\r\nmarshals thy path; it has power over thee as yet,--a power that defies\r\nmy own. In the last days of that Revolution which thou hailest, amidst\r\nthe wrecks of the Order thou cursest as Oppression, seek the fulfilment\r\nof thy destiny, and await thy cure.’\r\n\r\n“At that instant a troop of masks, clamorous, intoxicated, reeling, and\r\nrushing, as they reeled, poured into the room, and separated me from the\r\nmystic. I broke through them, and sought him everywhere, but in vain.\r\nAll my researches the next day were equally fruitless. Weeks were\r\nconsumed in the same pursuit,--not a trace of Mejnour could be\r\ndiscovered. Wearied with false pleasures, roused by reproaches I had\r\ndeserved, recoiling from Mejnour’s prophecy of the scene in which I was\r\nto seek deliverance, it occurred to me, at last, that in the sober air\r\nof my native country, and amidst its orderly and vigorous pursuits, I\r\nmight work out my own emancipation from the spectre. I left all whom\r\nI had before courted and clung to,--I came hither. Amidst mercenary\r\nschemes and selfish speculations, I found the same relief as in debauch\r\nand excess. The Phantom was invisible; but these pursuits soon became\r\nto me distasteful as the rest. Ever and ever I felt that I was born for\r\nsomething nobler than the greed of gain,--that life may be made equally\r\nworthless, and the soul equally degraded by the icy lust of avarice, as\r\nby the noisier passions. A higher ambition never ceased to torment\r\nme. But, but,” continued Glyndon, with a whitening lip and a visible\r\nshudder, “at every attempt to rise into loftier existence, came that\r\nhideous form. It gloomed beside me at the easel. Before the volumes of\r\npoet and sage it stood with its burning eyes in the stillness of night,\r\nand I thought I heard its horrible whispers uttering temptations never\r\nto be divulged.” He paused, and the drops stood upon his brow.\r\n\r\n“But I,” said Adela, mastering her fears and throwing her arms around\r\nhim,--“but I henceforth will have no life but in thine. And in this love\r\nso pure, so holy, thy terror shall fade away.”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” exclaimed Glyndon, starting from her. “The worst revelation is\r\nto come. Since thou hast been here, since I have sternly and resolutely\r\nrefrained from every haunt, every scene in which this preternatural\r\nenemy troubled me not, I--I--have--Oh, Heaven! Mercy--mercy! There it\r\nstands,--there, by thy side,--there, there!” And he fell to the ground\r\ninsensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.V.\r\n\r\n     Doch wunderbar ergriff mich’s diese Nacht;\r\n     Die Glieder schienen schon in Todes Macht.\r\n     Uhland.\r\n\r\n     (This night it fearfully seized on me; my limbs appeared already\r\n     in the power of death.)\r\n\r\nA fever, attended with delirium, for several days deprived Glyndon of\r\nconsciousness; and when, by Adela’s care more than the skill of the\r\nphysicians, he was restored to life and reason, he was unutterably\r\nshocked by the change in his sister’s appearance; at first, he fondly\r\nimagined that her health, affected by her vigils, would recover with his\r\nown. But he soon saw, with an anguish which partook of remorse, that the\r\nmalady was deep-seated,--deep, deep, beyond the reach of Aesculapius and\r\nhis drugs. Her imagination, little less lively than his own, was awfully\r\nimpressed by the strange confessions she had heard,--by the ravings\r\nof his delirium. Again and again had he shrieked forth, “It is\r\nthere,--there, by thy side, my sister!” He had transferred to her fancy\r\nthe spectre, and the horror that cursed himself. He perceived this, not\r\nby her words, but her silence; by the eyes that strained into space; by\r\nthe shiver that came over her frame; by the start of terror; by the look\r\nthat did not dare to turn behind. Bitterly he repented his confession;\r\nbitterly he felt that between his sufferings and human sympathy there\r\ncould be no gentle and holy commune; vainly he sought to retract,--to\r\nundo what he had done, to declare all was but the chimera of an\r\noverheated brain!\r\n\r\nAnd brave and generous was this denial of himself; for, often and often,\r\nas he thus spoke, he saw the Thing of Dread gliding to her side, and\r\nglaring at him as he disowned its being. But what chilled him, if\r\npossible, yet more than her wasting form and trembling nerves, was the\r\nchange in her love for him; a natural terror had replaced it. She turned\r\npaler if he approached,--she shuddered if he took her hand. Divided from\r\nthe rest of earth, the gulf of the foul remembrance yawned now between\r\nhis sister and himself. He could endure no more the presence of the one\r\nwhose life HIS life had embittered. He made some excuses for departure,\r\nand writhed to see that they were greeted eagerly. The first gleam of\r\njoy he had detected since that fatal night, on Adela’s face, he beheld\r\nwhen he murmured “Farewell.” He travelled for some weeks through the\r\nwildest parts of Scotland; scenery which MAKES the artist, was loveless\r\nto his haggard eyes. A letter recalled him to London on the wings of\r\nnew agony and fear; he arrived to find his sister in a condition both of\r\nmind and health which exceeded his worst apprehensions.\r\n\r\nHer vacant look, her lifeless posture, appalled him; it was as one who\r\ngazed on the Medusa’s head, and felt, without a struggle, the human\r\nbeing gradually harden to the statue. It was not frenzy, it was not\r\nidiocy,--it was an abstraction, an apathy, a sleep in waking. Only as\r\nthe night advanced towards the eleventh hour--the hour in which Glyndon\r\nhad concluded his tale--she grew visibly uneasy, anxious, and perturbed.\r\nThen her lips muttered; her hands writhed; she looked round with a look\r\nof unspeakable appeal for succour, for protection, and suddenly, as the\r\nclock struck, fell with a shriek to the ground, cold and lifeless. With\r\ndifficulty, and not until after the most earnest prayers, did she answer\r\nthe agonised questions of Glyndon; at last she owned that at that hour,\r\nand that hour alone, wherever she was placed, however occupied, she\r\ndistinctly beheld the apparition of an old hag, who, after thrice\r\nknocking at the door, entered the room, and hobbling up to her with a\r\ncountenance distorted by hideous rage and menace, laid its icy fingers\r\non her forehead: from that moment she declared that sense forsook her;\r\nand when she woke again, it was only to wait, in suspense that froze up\r\nher blood, the repetition of the ghastly visitation.\r\n\r\nThe physician who had been summoned before Glyndon’s return, and whose\r\nletter had recalled him to London, was a commonplace practitioner,\r\nignorant of the case, and honestly anxious that one more experienced\r\nshould be employed. Clarence called in one of the most eminent of the\r\nfaculty, and to him he recited the optical delusion of his sister. The\r\nphysician listened attentively, and seemed sanguine in his hopes of\r\ncure. He came to the house two hours before the one so dreaded by the\r\npatient. He had quietly arranged that the clocks should be put forward\r\nhalf an hour, unknown to Adela, and even to her brother. He was a man of\r\nthe most extraordinary powers of conversation, of surpassing wit, of\r\nall the faculties that interest and amuse. He first administered to the\r\npatient a harmless potion, which he pledged himself would dispel the\r\ndelusion. His confident tone woke her own hopes,--he continued to excite\r\nher attention, to rouse her lethargy; he jested, he laughed away the\r\ntime. The hour struck. “Joy, my brother!” she exclaimed, throwing\r\nherself in his arms; “the time is past!” And then, like one released\r\nfrom a spell, she suddenly assumed more than her ancient\r\ncheerfulness. “Ah, Clarence!” she whispered, “forgive me for my former\r\ndesertion,--forgive me that I feared YOU. I shall live!--I shall live!\r\nin my turn to banish the spectre that haunts my brother!” And Clarence\r\nsmiled and wiped the tears from his burning eyes. The physician renewed\r\nhis stories, his jests. In the midst of a stream of rich humour that\r\nseemed to carry away both brother and sister, Glyndon suddenly saw over\r\nAdela’s face the same fearful change, the same anxious look, the same\r\nrestless, straining eye, he had beheld the night before. He rose,--he\r\napproached her. Adela started up, “look--look--look!” she exclaimed.\r\n“She comes! Save me,--save me!” and she fell at his feet in strong\r\nconvulsions as the clock, falsely and in vain put forward, struck the\r\nhalf-hour.\r\n\r\nThe physician lifted her in his arms. “My worst fears are confirmed,”\r\n he said gravely; “the disease is epilepsy.” (The most celebrated\r\npractitioner in Dublin related to the editor a story of optical delusion\r\nprecisely similar in its circumstances and its physical cause to the one\r\nhere narrated.)\r\n\r\nThe next night, at the same hour, Adela Glyndon died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.VI.\r\n\r\n     La loi, dont le regne vous epouvante, a son glaive leve sur vous:\r\n     elle vous frappera tous:  le genre humain a besoin de cet\r\n     exemple.--Couthon.\r\n\r\n     (The law, whose reign terrifies you, has its sword raised against\r\n     you; it will strike you all:  humanity has need of this example.)\r\n\r\n“Oh, joy, joy!--thou art come again! This is thy hand--these thy lips.\r\nSay that thou didst not desert me from the love of another; say it\r\nagain,--say it ever!--and I will pardon thee all the rest!”\r\n\r\n“So thou hast mourned for me?”\r\n\r\n“Mourned!--and thou wert cruel enough to leave me gold; there it\r\nis,--there, untouched!”\r\n\r\n“Poor child of Nature! how, then, in this strange town of Marseilles,\r\nhast thou found bread and shelter?”\r\n\r\n“Honestly, soul of my soul! honestly, but yet by the face thou didst\r\nonce think so fair; thinkest thou THAT now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Fillide, more fair than ever. But what meanest thou?”\r\n\r\n“There is a painter here--a great man, one of their great men at Paris,\r\nI know not what they call them; but he rules over all here,--life and\r\ndeath; and he has paid me largely but to sit for my portrait. It is for\r\na picture to be given to the Nation, for he paints only for glory. Think\r\nof thy Fillide’s renown!” And the girl’s wild eyes sparkled; her vanity\r\nwas roused. “And he would have married me if I would!--divorced his wife\r\nto marry me! But I waited for thee, ungrateful!”\r\n\r\nA knock at the door was heard,--a man entered.\r\n\r\n“Nicot!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Glyndon!--hum!--welcome! What! thou art twice my rival! But Jean\r\nNicot bears no malice. Virtue is my dream,--my country, my mistress.\r\nServe my country, citizen; and I forgive thee the preference of beauty.\r\nCa ira! ca ira!”\r\n\r\nBut as the painter spoke, it hymned, it rolled through the streets,--the\r\nfiery song of the Marseillaise! There was a crowd, a multitude, a people\r\nup, abroad, with colours and arms, enthusiasm and song,--with song, with\r\nenthusiasm, with colours and arms! And who could guess that that\r\nmartial movement was one, not of war, but massacre,--Frenchmen against\r\nFrenchmen? For there are two parties in Marseilles,--and ample work for\r\nJourdan Coupe-tete! But this, the Englishman, just arrived, a stranger\r\nto all factions, did not as yet comprehend. He comprehended nothing but\r\nthe song, the enthusiasm, the arms, and the colours that lifted to the\r\nsun the glorious lie, “Le peuple Francais, debout contre les tyrans!”\r\n (Up, Frenchmen, against tyrants!)\r\n\r\nThe dark brow of the wretched wanderer grew animated; he gazed from the\r\nwindow on the throng that marched below, beneath their waving Oriflamme.\r\nThey shouted as they beheld the patriot Nicot, the friend of Liberty and\r\nrelentless Hebert, by the stranger’s side, at the casement.\r\n\r\n“Ay, shout again!” cried the painter,--“shout for the brave Englishman\r\nwho abjures his Pitts and his Coburgs to be a citizen of Liberty and\r\nFrance!”\r\n\r\nA thousand voices rent the air, and the hymn of the Marseillaise rose in\r\nmajesty again.\r\n\r\n“Well, and if it be among these high hopes and this brave people that\r\nthe phantom is to vanish, and the cure to come!” muttered Glyndon; and\r\nhe thought he felt again the elixir sparkling through his veins.\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt be one of the Convention with Paine and Clootz,--I will\r\nmanage it all for thee!” cried Nicot, slapping him on the shoulder: “and\r\nParis--”\r\n\r\n“Ah, if I could but see Paris!” cried Fillide, in her joyous voice.\r\nJoyous! the whole time, the town, the air--save where, unheard, rose the\r\ncry of agony and the yell of murder--were joy! Sleep unhaunting in thy\r\ngrave, cold Adela. Joy, joy! In the Jubilee of Humanity all private\r\ngriefs should cease! Behold, wild mariner, the vast whirlpool draws thee\r\nto its stormy bosom! There the individual is not. All things are of the\r\nwhole! Open thy gates, fair Paris, for the stranger-citizen! Receive in\r\nyour ranks, O meek Republicans, the new champion of liberty, of reason,\r\nof mankind! “Mejnour is right; it was in virtue, in valour, in glorious\r\nstruggle for the human race, that the spectre was to shrink to her\r\nkindred darkness.”\r\n\r\nAnd Nicot’s shrill voice praised him; and lean Robespierre--“Flambeau,\r\ncolonne, pierre angulaire de l’edifice de la Republique!” (“The light,\r\ncolumn, and keystone of the Republic.”--“Lettre du Citoyen P--; Papiers\r\ninedits trouves chez Robespierre,” tom 11, page 127.)--smiled ominously\r\non him from his bloodshot eyes; and Fillide clasped him with passionate\r\narms to her tender breast. And at his up-rising and down-sitting, at\r\nboard and in bed, though he saw it not, the Nameless One guided him with\r\nthe demon eyes to the sea whose waves were gore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI. -- SUPERSTITION DESERTING FAITH.\r\n\r\n     Why do I yield to that suggestion, Whose horrid image doth unfix\r\n     my hair.--Shakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.I.\r\n\r\n     Therefore the Genii were painted with a platter full of garlands\r\n     and flowers in one hand, and a whip in the other.--Alexander\r\n     Ross, “Mystag. Poet.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the order of the events related in this narrative, the\r\ndeparture of Zanoni and Viola from the Greek isle, in which two happy\r\nyears appear to have been passed, must have been somewhat later in date\r\nthan the arrival of Glyndon at Marseilles. It must have been in the\r\ncourse of the year 1791 when Viola fled from Naples with her mysterious\r\nlover, and when Glyndon sought Mejnour in the fatal castle. It is now\r\ntowards the close of 1793, when our story again returns to Zanoni. The\r\nstars of winter shone down on the lagunes of Venice. The hum of the\r\nRialto was hushed,--the last loiterers had deserted the Place of St.\r\nMark’s, and only at distant intervals might be heard the oars of the\r\nrapid gondolas, bearing reveller or lover to his home. But lights still\r\nflitted to and fro across the windows of one of the Palladian palaces,\r\nwhose shadow slept in the great canal; and within the palace watched the\r\ntwin Eumenides that never sleep for Man,--Fear and Pain.\r\n\r\n“I will make thee the richest man in all Venice, if thou savest her.”\r\n\r\n“Signor,” said the leech; “your gold cannot control death, and the will\r\nof Heaven, signor, unless within the next hour there is some blessed\r\nchange, prepare your courage.”\r\n\r\nHo--ho, Zanoni! man of mystery and might, who hast walked amidst the\r\npassions of the world, with no changes on thy brow, art thou tossed at\r\nlast upon the billows of tempestuous fear? Does thy spirit reel to and\r\nfro?--knowest thou at last the strength and the majesty of Death?\r\n\r\nHe fled, trembling, from the pale-faced man of art,--fled through\r\nstately hall and long-drawn corridor, and gained a remote chamber in the\r\npalace, which other step than his was not permitted to profane. Out\r\nwith thy herbs and vessels. Break from the enchanted elements, O\r\nsilvery-azure flame! Why comes he not,--the Son of the Starbeam! Why\r\nis Adon-Ai deaf to thy solemn call? It comes not,--the luminous and\r\ndelightsome Presence! Cabalist! are thy charms in vain? Has thy throne\r\nvanished from the realms of space? Thou standest pale and trembling.\r\nPale trembler! not thus didst thou look when the things of glory\r\ngathered at thy spell. Never to the pale trembler bow the things of\r\nglory: the soul, and not the herbs, nor the silvery-azure flame, nor the\r\nspells of the Cabala, commands the children of the air; and THY soul, by\r\nLove and Death, is made sceptreless and discrowned!\r\n\r\nAt length the flame quivers,--the air grows cold as the wind in\r\ncharnels. A thing not of earth is present,--a mistlike, formless thing.\r\nIt cowers in the distance,--a silent Horror! it rises; it creeps; it\r\nnears thee--dark in its mantle of dusky haze; and under its veil it\r\nlooks on thee with its livid, malignant eyes,--the thing of malignant\r\neyes!\r\n\r\n“Ha, young Chaldean! young in thy countless ages,--young as when, cold\r\nto pleasure and to beauty, thou stoodest on the old Firetower, and\r\nheardest the starry silence whisper to thee the last mystery that\r\nbaffles Death,--fearest thou Death at length? Is thy knowledge but a\r\ncircle that brings thee back whence thy wanderings began! Generations on\r\ngenerations have withered since we two met! Lo! thou beholdest me now!”\r\n\r\n“But I behold thee without fear! Though beneath thine eyes thousands\r\nhave perished; though, where they burn, spring up the foul poisons of\r\nthe human heart, and to those whom thou canst subject to thy will, thy\r\npresence glares in the dreams of the raving maniac, or blackens the\r\ndungeon of despairing crime, thou art not my vanquisher, but my slave!”\r\n\r\n“And as a slave will I serve thee! Command thy slave, O beautiful\r\nChaldean! Hark, the wail of women!--hark, the sharp shriek of thy\r\nbeloved one! Death is in thy palace! Adon-Ai comes not to thy call. Only\r\nwhere no cloud of the passion and the flesh veils the eye of the Serene\r\nIntelligence can the Sons of the Starbeam glide to man. But _I_ can aid\r\nthee!--hark!” And Zanoni heard distinctly in his heart, even at that\r\ndistance from the chamber, the voice of Viola calling in delirium on her\r\nbeloved one.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Viola, I can save thee not!” exclaimed the seer, passionately; “my\r\nlove for thee has made me powerless!”\r\n\r\n“Not powerless; I can gift thee with the art to save her,--I can place\r\nhealing in thy hand!”\r\n\r\n“For both?--child and mother,--for both?”\r\n\r\n“Both!”\r\n\r\nA convulsion shook the limbs of the seer,--a mighty struggle shook him\r\nas a child: the Humanity and the Hour conquered the repugnant spirit.\r\n\r\n“I yield! Mother and child--save both!”\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nIn the dark chamber lay Viola, in the sharpest agonies of travail; life\r\nseemed rending itself away in the groans and cries that spoke of pain in\r\nthe midst of frenzy; and still, in groan and cry, she called on Zanoni,\r\nher beloved. The physician looked to the clock; on it beat: the Heart\r\nof Time,--regularly and slowly,--Heart that never sympathised with Life,\r\nand never flagged for Death! “The cries are fainter,” said the leech;\r\n“in ten minutes more all will be past.”\r\n\r\nFool! the minutes laugh at thee; Nature, even now, like a blue sky\r\nthrough a shattered temple, is smiling through the tortured frame. The\r\nbreathing grows more calm and hushed; the voice of delirium is dumb,--a\r\nsweet dream has come to Viola. Is it a dream, or is it the soul that\r\nsees? She thinks suddenly that she is with Zanoni, that her burning head\r\nis pillowed on his bosom; she thinks, as he gazes on her, that his eyes\r\ndispel the tortures that prey upon her,--the touch of his hand cools the\r\nfever on her brow; she hears his voice in murmurs,--it is a music from\r\nwhich the fiends fly. Where is the mountain that seemed to press upon\r\nher temples? Like a vapour, it rolls away. In the frosts of the winter\r\nnight, she sees the sun laughing in luxurious heaven,--she hears the\r\nwhisper of green leaves; the beautiful world, valley and stream and\r\nwoodland, lie before, and with a common voice speak to her, “We are\r\nnot yet past for thee!” Fool of drugs and formula, look to thy\r\ndial-plate!--the hand has moved on; the minutes are with Eternity; the\r\nsoul thy sentence would have dismissed, still dwells on the shores of\r\nTime. She sleeps: the fever abates; the convulsions are gone; the living\r\nrose blooms upon her cheek; the crisis is past! Husband, thy wife lives;\r\nlover, thy universe is no solitude! Heart of Time, beat on! A while, a\r\nlittle while,--joy! joy! joy!--father, embrace thy child!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.II.\r\n\r\n     Tristis Erinnys\r\n     Praetulit infaustas sanguinolenta faces.\r\n     Ovid.\r\n\r\n     (Erinnys, doleful and bloody, extends the unblessed torches.)\r\n\r\nAnd they placed the child in the father’s arms! As silently he bent\r\nover it, tears--tears, how human!--fell from his eyes like rain! And\r\nthe little one smiled through the tears that bathed its cheeks! Ah, with\r\nwhat happy tears we welcome the stranger into our sorrowing world!\r\nWith what agonising tears we dismiss the stranger back to the angels!\r\nUnselfish joy; but how selfish is the sorrow!\r\n\r\nAnd now through the silent chamber a faint sweet voice is heard,--the\r\nyoung mother’s voice.\r\n\r\n“I am here: I am by thy side!” murmured Zanoni.\r\n\r\nThe mother smiled, and clasped his hand, and asked no more; she was\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nViola recovered with a rapidity that startled the physician; and the\r\nyoung stranger thrived as if it already loved the world to which it had\r\ndescended. From that hour Zanoni seemed to live in the infant’s life,\r\nand in that life the souls of mother and father met as in a new bond.\r\nNothing more beautiful than this infant had eye ever dwelt upon. It was\r\nstrange to the nurses that it came not wailing to the light, but smiled\r\nto the light as a thing familiar to it before. It never uttered one cry\r\nof childish pain. In its very repose it seemed to be listening to some\r\nhappy voice within its heart: it seemed itself so happy. In its eyes\r\nyou would have thought intellect already kindled, though it had not yet\r\nfound a language. Already it seemed to recognise its parents; already\r\nit stretched forth its arms when Zanoni bent over the bed, in which\r\nit breathed and bloomed,--the budding flower! And from that bed he was\r\nrarely absent: gazing upon it with his serene, delighted eyes, his soul\r\nseemed to feed its own. At night and in utter darkness he was still\r\nthere; and Viola often heard him murmuring over it as she lay in\r\na half-sleep. But the murmur was in a language strange to her; and\r\nsometimes when she heard she feared, and vague, undefined superstitions\r\ncame back to her,--the superstitions of earlier youth. A mother fears\r\neverything, even the gods, for her new-born. The mortals shrieked aloud\r\nwhen of old they saw the great Demeter seeking to make their child\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nBut Zanoni, wrapped in the sublime designs that animated the human love\r\nto which he was now awakened, forgot all, even all he had forfeited or\r\nincurred, in the love that blinded him.\r\n\r\nBut the dark, formless thing, though he nor invoked nor saw it, crept,\r\noften, round and round him, and often sat by the infant’s couch, with\r\nits hateful eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.III.\r\n\r\n     Fuscis tellurem amplectitur alis.\r\n     Virgil.\r\n\r\n     (Embraces the Earth with gloomy wings.)\r\n\r\nLetter from Zanoni to Mejnour.\r\n\r\nMejnour, Humanity, with all its sorrows and its joys, is mine once more.\r\nDay by day, I am forging my own fetters. I live in other lives than my\r\nown, and in them I have lost more than half my empire. Not lifting them\r\naloft, they drag me by the strong bands of the affections to their own\r\nearth. Exiled from the beings only visible to the most abstract sense,\r\nthe grim Enemy that guards the Threshold has entangled me in its web.\r\nCanst thou credit me, when I tell thee that I have accepted its gifts,\r\nand endure the forfeit? Ages must pass ere the brighter beings can again\r\nobey the spirit that has bowed to the ghastly one! And--\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nIn this hope, then, Mejnour, I triumph still; I yet have supreme power\r\nover this young life. Insensibly and inaudibly my soul speaks to its\r\nown, and prepares it even now. Thou knowest that for the pure and\r\nunsullied infant spirit, the ordeal has no terror and no peril. Thus\r\nunceasingly I nourish it with no unholy light; and ere it yet be\r\nconscious of the gift, it will gain the privileges it has been mine to\r\nattain: the child, by slow and scarce-seen degrees, will communicate its\r\nown attributes to the mother; and content to see Youth forever radiant\r\non the brows of the two that now suffice to fill up my whole infinity of\r\nthought, shall I regret the airier kingdom that vanishes hourly from my\r\ngrasp? But thou, whose vision is still clear and serene, look into the\r\nfar deeps shut from my gaze, and counsel me, or forewarn! I know that\r\nthe gifts of the Being whose race is so hostile to our own are, to the\r\ncommon seeker, fatal and perfidious as itself. And hence, when, at the\r\noutskirts of knowledge, which in earlier ages men called Magic,\r\nthey encountered the things of the hostile tribes, they believed the\r\napparitions to be fiends, and, by fancied compacts, imagined they had\r\nsigned away their souls; as if man could give for an eternity that over\r\nwhich he has control but while he lives! Dark, and shrouded forever from\r\nhuman sight, dwell the demon rebels, in their impenetrable realm; in\r\nthem is no breath of the Divine One. In every human creature the Divine\r\nOne breathes; and He alone can judge His own hereafter, and allot its\r\nnew career and home. Could man sell himself to the fiend, man could\r\nprejudge himself, and arrogate the disposal of eternity! But these\r\ncreatures, modifications as they are of matter, and some with more\r\nthan the malignanty of man, may well seem, to fear and unreasoning\r\nsuperstition, the representatives of fiends. And from the darkest and\r\nmightiest of them I have accepted a boon,--the secret that startled\r\nDeath from those so dear to me. Can I not trust that enough of power yet\r\nremains to me to baffle or to daunt the Phantom, if it seek to pervert\r\nthe gift? Answer me, Mejnour, for in the darkness that veils me, I see\r\nonly the pure eyes of the new-born; I hear only the low beating of my\r\nheart. Answer me, thou whose wisdom is without love!\r\n\r\nMejnour to Zanoni.\r\n\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nFallen One!--I see before thee Evil and Death and Woe! Thou to have\r\nrelinquished Adon-Ai for the nameless Terror,--the heavenly stars for\r\nthose fearful eyes! Thou, at the last to be the victim of the Larva of\r\nthe dreary Threshold, that, in thy first novitiate, fled, withered\r\nand shrivelled, from thy kingly brow! When, at the primary grades of\r\ninitiation, the pupil I took from thee on the shores of the changed\r\nParthenope, fell senseless and cowering before that Phantom-Darkness, I\r\nknew that his spirit was not formed to front the worlds beyond; for\r\nFEAR is the attraction of man to earthiest earth, and while he fears, he\r\ncannot soar. But THOU, seest thou not that to love is but to fear; seest\r\nthou not that the power of which thou boastest over the malignant one\r\nis already gone? It awes, it masters thee; it will mock thee and betray.\r\nLose not a moment; come to me. If there can yet be sufficient sympathy\r\nbetween us, through MY eyes shalt thou see, and perhaps guard against\r\nthe perils that, shapeless yet, and looming through the shadow, marshal\r\nthemselves around thee and those whom thy very love has doomed. Come\r\nfrom all the ties of thy fond humanity; they will but obscure thy\r\nvision! Come forth from thy fears and hopes, thy desires and passions.\r\nCome, as alone Mind can be the monarch and the seer, shining through the\r\nhome it tenants,--a pure, impressionless, sublime intelligence!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.IV.\r\n\r\n     Plus que vous ne pensez ce moment est terrible.\r\n     La Harpe, “Le Comte de Warwick,” Act 3, sc. 5.\r\n\r\n     (The moment is more terrible than you think.)\r\n\r\nFor the first time since their union, Zanoni and Viola were\r\nseparated,--Zanoni went to Rome on important business. “It was,” he\r\nsaid, “but for a few days;” and he went so suddenly that there was\r\nlittle time either for surprise or sorrow. But first parting is always\r\nmore melancholy than it need be: it seems an interruption to the\r\nexistence which Love shares with Love; it makes the heart feel what a\r\nvoid life will be when the last parting shall succeed, as succeed it\r\nmust, the first. But Viola had a new companion; she was enjoying that\r\nmost delicious novelty which ever renews the youth and dazzles the eyes\r\nof woman. As the mistress--the wife--she leans on another; from another\r\nare reflected her happiness, her being,--as an orb that takes light from\r\nits sun. But now, in turn, as the mother, she is raised from dependence\r\ninto power; it is another that leans on her,--a star has sprung into\r\nspace, to which she herself has become the sun!\r\n\r\nA few days,--but they will be sweet through the sorrow! A few\r\ndays,--every hour of which seems an era to the infant, over whom bend\r\nwatchful the eyes and the heart. From its waking to its sleep, from\r\nits sleep to its waking, is a revolution in Time. Every gesture to be\r\nnoted,--every smile to seem a new progress into the world it has come\r\nto bless! Zanoni has gone,--the last dash of the oar is lost, the last\r\nspeck of the gondola has vanished from the ocean-streets of Venice! Her\r\ninfant is sleeping in the cradle at the mother’s feet; and she thinks\r\nthrough her tears what tales of the fairy-land, that spreads far and\r\nwide, with a thousand wonders, in that narrow bed, she shall have to\r\ntell the father! Smile on, weep on, young mother! Already the fairest\r\nleaf in the wild volume is closed for thee, and the invisible finger\r\nturns the page!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nBy the bridge of the Rialto stood two Venetians--ardent Republicans and\r\nDemocrats--looking to the Revolution of France as the earthquake which\r\nmust shatter their own expiring and vicious constitution, and give\r\nequality of ranks and rights to Venice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Cottalto,” said one; “my correspondent of Paris has promised to\r\nelude all obstacles, and baffle all danger. He will arrange with us the\r\nhour of revolt, when the legions of France shall be within hearing of\r\nour guns. One day in this week, at this hour, he is to meet me here.\r\nThis is but the fourth day.”\r\n\r\nHe had scarce said these words before a man, wrapped in his roquelaire,\r\nemerging from one of the narrow streets to the left, halted opposite\r\nthe pair, and eying them for a few moments with an earnest scrutiny,\r\nwhispered, “Salut!”\r\n\r\n“Et fraternite,” answered the speaker.\r\n\r\n“You, then, are the brave Dandolo with whom the Comite deputed me to\r\ncorrespond? And this citizen--”\r\n\r\n“Is Cottalto, whom my letters have so often mentioned.” (I know not if\r\nthe author of the original MSS. designs, under these names, to introduce\r\nthe real Cottalto and the true Dandolo, who, in 1797, distinguished\r\nthemselves by their sympathy with the French, and their democratic\r\nardor.--Ed.)\r\n\r\n“Health and brotherhood to him! I have much to impart to you both. I\r\nwill meet you at night, Dandolo. But in the streets we may be observed.”\r\n\r\n“And I dare not appoint my own house; tyranny makes spies of our very\r\nwalls. But the place herein designated is secure;” and he slipped an\r\naddress into the hand of his correspondent.\r\n\r\n“To-night, then, at nine! Meanwhile I have other business.” The man\r\npaused, his colour changed, and it was with an eager and passionate\r\nvoice that he resumed,--\r\n\r\n“Your last letter mentioned this wealthy and mysterious visitor,--this\r\nZanoni. He is still at Venice?”\r\n\r\n“I heard that he had left this morning; but his wife is still here.”\r\n\r\n“His wife!--that is well!”\r\n\r\n“What know you of him? Think you that he would join us? His wealth would\r\nbe--”\r\n\r\n“His house, his address,--quick!” interrupted the man.\r\n\r\n“The Palazzo di --, on the Grand Canal.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you,--at nine we meet.”\r\n\r\nThe man hurried on through the street from which he had emerged; and,\r\npassing by the house in which he had taken up his lodging (he had\r\narrived at Venice the night before), a woman who stood by the door\r\ncaught his arm.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” she said in French, “I have been watching for your return.\r\nDo you understand me? I will brave all, risk all, to go back with you to\r\nFrance,--to stand, through life or in death, by my husband’s side!”\r\n\r\n“Citoyenne, I promised your husband that, if such your choice, I would\r\nhazard my own safety to aid it. But think again! Your husband is one of\r\nthe faction which Robespierre’s eyes have already marked; he cannot\r\nfly. All France is become a prison to the ‘suspect.’ You do not endanger\r\nyourself by return. Frankly, citoyenne, the fate you would share may be\r\nthe guillotine. I speak (as you know by his letter) as your husband bade\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, I will return with you,” said the woman, with a smile upon\r\nher pale face.\r\n\r\n“And yet you deserted your husband in the fair sunshine of the\r\nRevolution, to return to him amidst its storms and thunder,” said the\r\nman, in a tone half of wonder, half rebuke.\r\n\r\n“Because my father’s days were doomed; because he had no safety but in\r\nflight to a foreign land; because he was old and penniless, and had none\r\nbut me to work for him; because my husband was not then in danger,\r\nand my father was! HE is dead--dead! My husband is in danger now. The\r\ndaughter’s duties are no more,--the wife’s return!”\r\n\r\n“Be it so, citoyenne; on the third night I depart. Before then you may\r\nretract your choice.”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\nA dark smile passed over the man’s face.\r\n\r\n“O guillotine!” he said, “how many virtues hast thou brought to light!\r\nWell may they call thee ‘A Holy Mother!’ O gory guillotine!”\r\n\r\nHe passed on muttering to himself, hailed a gondola, and was soon amidst\r\nthe crowded waters of the Grand Canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.V.\r\n\r\n     Ce que j’ignore\r\n     Est plus triste peut-etre et plus affreux encore.\r\n     La Harpe, “Le Comte de Warwick,” Act 5, sc. 1.\r\n\r\n     (That which I know not is, perhaps, more sad and fearful still.)\r\n\r\nThe casement stood open, and Viola was seated by it. Beneath sparkled\r\nthe broad waters in the cold but cloudless sunlight; and to that\r\nfair form, that half-averted face, turned the eyes of many a gallant\r\ncavalier, as their gondolas glided by.\r\n\r\nBut at last, in the centre of the canal, one of these dark vessels\r\nhalted motionless, as a man fixed his gaze from its lattice upon that\r\nstately palace. He gave the word to the rowers,--the vessel approached\r\nthe marge. The stranger quitted the gondola; he passed up the\r\nbroad stairs; he entered the palace. Weep on, smile no more, young\r\nmother!--the last page is turned!\r\n\r\nAn attendant entered the room, and gave to Viola a card, with these\r\nwords in English, “Viola, I must see you! Clarence Glyndon.”\r\n\r\nOh, yes, how gladly Viola would see him; how gladly speak to him of her\r\nhappiness, of Zanoni!--how gladly show to him her child! Poor Clarence!\r\nshe had forgotten him till now, as she had all the fever of her earlier\r\nlife,--its dreams, its vanities, its poor excitement, the lamps of the\r\ngaudy theatre, the applause of the noisy crowd.\r\n\r\nHe entered. She started to behold him, so changed were his gloomy brow,\r\nhis resolute, careworn features, from the graceful form and careless\r\ncountenance of the artist-lover. His dress, though not mean, was rude,\r\nneglected, and disordered. A wild, desperate, half-savage air had\r\nsupplanted that ingenuous mien, diffident in its grace, earnest in its\r\ndiffidence, which had once characterised the young worshipper of Art,\r\nthe dreaming aspirant after some starrier lore.\r\n\r\n“Is it you?” she said at last. “Poor Clarence, how changed!”\r\n\r\n“Changed!” he said abruptly, as he placed himself by her side. “And whom\r\nam I to thank, but the fiends--the sorcerers--who have seized upon thy\r\nexistence, as upon mine? Viola, hear me. A few weeks since the news\r\nreached me that you were in Venice. Under other pretences, and through\r\ninnumerable dangers, I have come hither, risking liberty, perhaps\r\nlife, if my name and career are known in Venice, to warn and save you.\r\nChanged, you call me!--changed without; but what is that to the ravages\r\nwithin? Be warned, be warned in time!”\r\n\r\nThe voice of Glyndon, sounding hollow and sepulchral, alarmed Viola even\r\nmore than his words. Pale, haggard, emaciated, he seemed almost as one\r\nrisen from the dead, to appall and awe her. “What,” she said, at last,\r\nin a faltering voice,--“what wild words do you utter! Can you--”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” interrupted Glyndon, laying his hand upon her arm, and its\r\ntouch was as cold as death,--“listen! You have heard of the old stories\r\nof men who have leagued themselves with devils for the attainment of\r\npreternatural powers. Those stories are not fables. Such men live.\r\nTheir delight is to increase the unhallowed circle of wretches like\r\nthemselves. If their proselytes fail in the ordeal, the demon seizes\r\nthem, even in this life, as it hath seized me!--if they succeed, woe,\r\nyea, a more lasting woe! There is another life, where no spells can\r\ncharm the evil one, or allay the torture. I have come from a scene where\r\nblood flows in rivers,--where Death stands by the side of the bravest\r\nand the highest, and the one monarch is the Guillotine; but all the\r\nmortal perils with which men can be beset, are nothing to the dreariness\r\nof the chamber where the Horror that passes death moves and stirs!”\r\n\r\nIt was then that Glyndon, with a cold and distinct precision, detailed,\r\nas he had done to Adela, the initiation through which he had gone. He\r\ndescribed, in words that froze the blood of his listener, the appearance\r\nof that formless phantom, with the eyes that seared the brain and\r\ncongealed the marrow of those who beheld. Once seen, it never\r\nwas to be exorcised. It came at its own will, prompting black\r\nthoughts,--whispering strange temptations. Only in scenes of turbulent\r\nexcitement was it absent! Solitude, serenity, the struggling desires\r\nafter peace and virtue,--THESE were the elements it loved to haunt!\r\nBewildered, terror-stricken, the wild account confirmed by the dim\r\nimpressions that never, in the depth and confidence of affection, had\r\nbeen closely examined, but rather banished as soon as felt,--that\r\nthe life and attributes of Zanoni were not like those of\r\nmortals,--impressions which her own love had made her hitherto censure\r\nas suspicions that wronged, and which, thus mitigated, had perhaps only\r\nserved to rivet the fascinated chains in which he bound her heart and\r\nsenses, but which now, as Glyndon’s awful narrative filled her\r\nwith contagious dread, half unbound the very spells they had woven\r\nbefore,--Viola started up in fear, not for HERSELF, and clasped her\r\nchild in her arms!\r\n\r\n“Unhappiest one!” cried Glyndon, shuddering, “hast thou indeed given\r\nbirth to a victim thou canst not save? Refuse it sustenance,--let it\r\nlook to thee in vain for food! In the grave, at least, there are repose\r\nand peace!”\r\n\r\nThen there came back to Viola’s mind the remembrance of Zanoni’s\r\nnight-long watches by that cradle, and the fear which even then had\r\ncrept over her as she heard his murmured half-chanted words. And as\r\nthe child looked at her with its clear, steadfast eye, in the strange\r\nintelligence of that look there was something that only confirmed her\r\nawe. So there both Mother and Forewarner stood in silence,--the sun\r\nsmiling upon them through the casement, and dark by the cradle, though\r\nthey saw it not, sat the motionless, veiled Thing!\r\n\r\nBut by degrees better and juster and more grateful memories of the past\r\nreturned to the young mother. The features of the infant, as she gazed,\r\ntook the aspect of the absent father. A voice seemed to break from those\r\nrosy lips, and say, mournfully, “I speak to thee in thy child. In return\r\nfor all my love for thee and thine, dost thou distrust me, at the first\r\nsentence of a maniac who accuses?”\r\n\r\nHer breast heaved, her stature rose, her eyes shone with a serene and\r\nholy light.\r\n\r\n“Go, poor victim of thine own delusions,” she said to Glyndon; “I\r\nwould not believe mine own senses, if they accused ITS father! And\r\nwhat knowest thou of Zanoni? What relation have Mejnour and the grisly\r\nspectres he invoked, with the radiant image with which thou wouldst\r\nconnect them?”\r\n\r\n“Thou wilt learn too soon,” replied Glyndon, gloomily. “And the very\r\nphantom that haunts me, whispers, with its bloodless lips, that its\r\nhorrors await both thine and thee! I take not thy decision yet; before I\r\nleave Venice we shall meet again.”\r\n\r\nHe said, and departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.VI.\r\n\r\n     Quel est l’egarement ou ton ame se livre?\r\n     La Harpe, “Le Comte de Warwick,” Act 4, sc. 4.\r\n\r\n     (To what delusion does thy soul abandon itself?)\r\n\r\nAlas, Zanoni! the aspirer, the dark, bright one!--didst thou think that\r\nthe bond between the survivor of ages and the daughter of a day could\r\nendure? Didst thou not foresee that, until the ordeal was past, there\r\ncould be no equality between thy wisdom and her love? Art thou absent\r\nnow seeking amidst thy solemn secrets the solemn safeguards for child\r\nand mother, and forgettest thou that the phantom that served thee hath\r\npower over its own gifts,--over the lives it taught thee to rescue from\r\nthe grave? Dost thou not know that Fear and Distrust, once sown in the\r\nheart of Love, spring up from the seed into a forest that excludes the\r\nstars? Dark, bright one! the hateful eyes glare beside the mother and\r\nthe child!\r\n\r\nAll that day Viola was distracted by a thousand thoughts and terrors,\r\nwhich fled as she examined them to settle back the darklier. She\r\nremembered that, as she had once said to Glyndon, her very childhood had\r\nbeen haunted with strange forebodings, that she was ordained for some\r\npreternatural doom. She remembered that, as she had told him this,\r\nsitting by the seas that slumbered in the arms of the Bay of Naples, he,\r\ntoo, had acknowledged the same forebodings, and a mysterious sympathy\r\nhad appeared to unite their fates. She remembered, above all, that,\r\ncomparing their entangled thoughts, both had then said, that with the\r\nfirst sight of Zanoni the foreboding, the instinct, had spoken to their\r\nhearts more audibly than before, whispering that “with HIM was connected\r\nthe secret of the unconjectured life.”\r\n\r\nAnd now, when Glyndon and Viola met again, the haunting fears of\r\nchildhood, thus referred to, woke from their enchanted sleep. With\r\nGlyndon’s terror she felt a sympathy, against which her reason and her\r\nlove struggled in vain. And still, when she turned her looks upon her\r\nchild, it watched her with that steady, earnest eye, and its lips moved\r\nas if it sought to speak to her,--but no sound came. The infant refused\r\nto sleep. Whenever she gazed upon its face, still those wakeful,\r\nwatchful eyes!--and in their earnestness, there spoke something of pain,\r\nof upbraiding, of accusation. They chilled her as she looked. Unable\r\nto endure, of herself, this sudden and complete revulsion of all the\r\nfeelings which had hitherto made up her life, she formed the resolution\r\nnatural to her land and creed; she sent for the priest who had\r\nhabitually attended her at Venice, and to him she confessed, with\r\npassionate sobs and intense terror, the doubts that had broken upon her.\r\nThe good father, a worthy and pious man, but with little education and\r\nless sense, one who held (as many of the lower Italians do to this day)\r\neven a poet to be a sort of sorcerer, seemed to shut the gates of\r\nhope upon her heart. His remonstrances were urgent, for his horror was\r\nunfeigned. He joined with Glyndon in imploring her to fly, if she felt\r\nthe smallest doubt that her husband’s pursuits were of the nature which\r\nthe Roman Church had benevolently burned so many scholars for adopting.\r\nAnd even the little that Viola could communicate seemed, to the ignorant\r\nascetic, irrefragable proof of sorcery and witchcraft; he had, indeed,\r\npreviously heard some of the strange rumours which followed the path\r\nof Zanoni, and was therefore prepared to believe the worst; the worthy\r\nBartolomeo would have made no bones of sending Watt to the stake, had he\r\nheard him speak of the steam-engine. But Viola, as untutored as himself,\r\nwas terrified by his rough and vehement eloquence,--terrified, for\r\nby that penetration which Catholic priests, however dull, generally\r\nacquire, in their vast experience of the human heart hourly exposed\r\nto their probe, Bartolomeo spoke less of danger to herself than to her\r\nchild. “Sorcerers,” said he, “have ever sought the most to decoy and\r\nseduce the souls of the young,--nay, the infant;” and therewith he\r\nentered into a long catalogue of legendary fables, which he quoted\r\nas historical facts. All at which an English woman would have smiled,\r\nappalled the tender but superstitious Neapolitan; and when the priest\r\nleft her, with solemn rebukes and grave accusations of a dereliction of\r\nher duties to her child, if she hesitated to fly with it from an abode\r\npolluted by the darker powers and unhallowed arts, Viola, still clinging\r\nto the image of Zanoni, sank into a passive lethargy which held her very\r\nreason in suspense.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed: night came on; the house was hushed; and Viola, slowly\r\nawakened from the numbness and torpor which had usurped her faculties,\r\ntossed to and fro on her couch, restless and perturbed. The stillness\r\nbecame intolerable; yet more intolerable the sound that alone broke it,\r\nthe voice of the clock, knelling moment after moment to its grave. The\r\nmoments, at last, seemed themselves to find voice,--to gain shape. She\r\nthought she beheld them springing, wan and fairy-like, from the womb of\r\ndarkness; and ere they fell again, extinguished, into that womb, their\r\ngrave, their low small voices murmured, “Woman, we report to eternity\r\nall that is done in time! What shall we report of thee, O guardian of a\r\nnew-born soul?” She became sensible that her fancies had brought a sort\r\nof partial delirium, that she was in a state between sleep and waking,\r\nwhen suddenly one thought became more predominant than the rest. The\r\nchamber which, in that and every house they had inhabited, even that in\r\nthe Greek isles, Zanoni had set apart to a solitude on which none might\r\nintrude, the threshold of which even Viola’s step was forbid to cross,\r\nand never, hitherto, in that sweet repose of confidence which belongs to\r\ncontented love, had she even felt the curious desire to disobey,--now,\r\nthat chamber drew her towards it. Perhaps THERE might be found a\r\nsomewhat to solve the riddle, to dispel or confirm the doubt: that\r\nthought grew and deepened in its intenseness; it fastened on her as with\r\na palpable and irresistible grasp; it seemed to raise her limbs without\r\nher will.\r\n\r\nAnd now, through the chamber, along the galleries thou glidest, O lovely\r\nshape! sleep-walking, yet awake. The moon shines on thee as thou glidest\r\nby, casement after casement, white-robed and wandering spirit!--thine\r\narms crossed upon thy bosom, thine eyes fixed and open, with a calm\r\nunfearing awe. Mother, it is thy child that leads thee on! The fairy\r\nmoments go before thee; thou hearest still the clock-knell tolling them\r\nto their graves behind. On, gliding on, thou hast gained the door; no\r\nlock bars thee, no magic spell drives thee back. Daughter of the\r\ndust, thou standest alone with night in the chamber where, pale and\r\nnumberless, the hosts of space have gathered round the seer!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.VII.\r\n\r\n     Des Erdenlebens\r\n     Schweres Traumbild sinkt, und sinkt, und sinkt.\r\n     “Das Ideal und das Lebens.”\r\n\r\n     (The Dream Shape of the heavy earthly life sinks, and sinks, and\r\n     sinks.)\r\n\r\nShe stood within the chamber, and gazed around her; no signs by which an\r\ninquisitor of old could have detected the scholar of the Black Art were\r\nvisible. No crucibles and caldrons, no brass-bound volumes and ciphered\r\ngirdles, no skulls and cross-bones. Quietly streamed the broad moonlight\r\nthrough the desolate chamber with its bare, white walls. A few bunches\r\nof withered herbs, a few antique vessels of bronze, placed carelessly on\r\na wooden form, were all which that curious gaze could identify with the\r\npursuits of the absent owner. The magic, if it existed, dwelt in the\r\nartificer, and the materials, to other hands, were but herbs and bronze.\r\nSo is it ever with thy works and wonders, O Genius,--Seeker of the\r\nStars! Words themselves are the common property of all men; yet, from\r\nwords themselves, Thou Architect of Immortalities, pilest up temples\r\nthat shall outlive the Pyramids, and the very leaf of the Papyrus\r\nbecomes a Shinar, stately with towers, round which the Deluge of Ages,\r\nshall roar in vain!\r\n\r\nBut in that solitude has the Presence that there had invoked its wonders\r\nleft no enchantment of its own? It seemed so; for as Viola stood in the\r\nchamber, she became sensible that some mysterious change was at work\r\nwithin herself. Her blood coursed rapidly, and with a sensation of\r\ndelight, through her veins,--she felt as if chains were falling from\r\nher limbs, as if cloud after cloud was rolling from her gaze. All the\r\nconfused thoughts which had moved through her trance settled and centred\r\nthemselves in one intense desire to see the Absent One,--to be with him.\r\nThe monads that make up space and air seemed charged with a spiritual\r\nattraction,--to become a medium through which her spirit could pass from\r\nits clay, and confer with the spirit to which the unutterable desire\r\ncompelled it. A faintness seized her; she tottered to the seat on which\r\nthe vessels and herbs were placed, and, as she bent down, she saw in one\r\nof the vessels a small vase of crystal. By a mechanical and involuntary\r\nimpulse, her hand seized the vase; she opened it, and the volatile\r\nessence it contained sparkled up, and spread through the room a powerful\r\nand delicious fragrance. She inhaled the odour, she laved her temples\r\nwith the liquid, and suddenly her life seemed to spring up from the\r\nprevious faintness,--to spring, to soar, to float, to dilate upon the\r\nwings of a bird. The room vanished from her eyes. Away, away, over lands\r\nand seas and space on the rushing desire flies the disprisoned mind!\r\n\r\nUpon a stratum, not of this world, stood the world-born shapes of the\r\nsons of Science, upon an embryo world, upon a crude, wan, attenuated\r\nmass of matter, one of the Nebulae, which the suns of the myriad systems\r\nthrow off as they roll round the Creator’s throne*, to become themselves\r\nnew worlds of symmetry and glory,--planets and suns that forever and\r\nforever shall in their turn multiply their shining race, and be the\r\nfathers of suns and planets yet to come.\r\n\r\n     (* “Astronomy instructs us that, in the original condition of\r\n     the solar system, the sun was the nucleus of a nebulosity or\r\n     luminous mass which revolved on its axis, and extended far\r\n     beyond the orbits of all the planets,--the planets as yet\r\n     having no existence. Its temperature gradually diminished,\r\n     and, becoming contracted by cooling, the rotation increased\r\n     in rapidity, and zones of nebulosity were successively\r\n     thrown off, in consequence of the centrifugal force\r\n     overpowering the central attraction. The condensation of\r\n     these separate masses constituted the planets and\r\n     satellites. But this view of the conversion of gaseous\r\n     matter into planetary bodies is not limited to our own\r\n     system; it extends to the formation of the innumerable suns\r\n     and worlds which are distributed throughout the universe.\r\n     The sublime discoveries of modern astronomers have shown\r\n     that every part of the realms of space abounds in large\r\n     expansions of attenuated matter termed nebulae, which are\r\n     irregularly reflective of light, of various figures, and in\r\n     different states of condensation, from that of a diffused,\r\n     luminous mass to suns and planets like our own.”--From\r\n     Mantell’s eloquent and delightful work, entitled “The\r\n     Wonders of Geology,” volume i. page 22.)\r\n\r\nThere, in that enormous solitude of an infant world, which thousands and\r\nthousands of years can alone ripen into form, the spirit of Viola beheld\r\nthe shape of Zanoni, or rather the likeness, the simulacrun, the LEMUR\r\nof his shape, not its human and corporeal substance,--as if, like hers,\r\nthe Intelligence was parted from the Clay,--and as the sun, while it\r\nrevolves and glows, had cast off into remotest space that nebular image\r\nof itself, so the thing of earth, in the action of its more luminous and\r\nenduring being, had thrown its likeness into that new-born stranger of\r\nthe heavens. There stood the phantom,--a phantom Mejnour, by its side.\r\nIn the gigantic chaos around raved and struggled the kindling elements;\r\nwater and fire, darkness and light, at war,--vapour and cloud hardening\r\ninto mountains, and the Breath of Life moving like a steadfast splendour\r\nover all.\r\n\r\nAs the dreamer looked, and shivered, she beheld that even there the\r\ntwo phantoms of humanity were not alone. Dim monster-forms that that\r\ndisordered chaos alone could engender, the first reptile Colossal race\r\nthat wreathe and crawl through the earliest stratum of a world labouring\r\ninto life, coiled in the oozing matter or hovered through the meteorous\r\nvapours. But these the two seekers seemed not to heed; their gaze was\r\nfixed intent upon an object in the farthest space. With the eyes of the\r\nspirit, Viola followed theirs; with a terror far greater than the chaos\r\nand its hideous inhabitants produced, she beheld a shadowy likeness\r\nof the very room in which her form yet dwelt, its white walls, the\r\nmoonshine sleeping on its floor, its open casement, with the quiet roofs\r\nand domes of Venice looming over the sea that sighed below,--and in that\r\nroom the ghost-like image of herself! This double phantom--here herself\r\na phantom, gazing there upon a phantom-self--had in it a horror which no\r\nwords can tell, no length of life forego.\r\n\r\nBut presently she saw this image of herself rise slowly, leave the room\r\nwith its noiseless feet: it passes the corridor, it kneels by a cradle!\r\nHeaven of Heaven! She beholds her child!--still with its wondrous,\r\nchild-like beauty and its silent, wakeful eyes. But beside that cradle\r\nthere sits cowering a mantled, shadowy form,--the more fearful and\r\nghastly from its indistinct and unsubstantial gloom. The walls of that\r\nchamber seem to open as the scene of a theatre. A grim dungeon; streets\r\nthrough which pour shadowy crowds; wrath and hatred, and the aspect\r\nof demons in their ghastly visages; a place of death; a murderous\r\ninstrument; a shamble-house of human flesh; herself; her child;--all,\r\nall, rapid phantasmagoria, chased each other. Suddenly the\r\nphantom-Zanoni turned, it seemed to perceive herself,--her second self.\r\nIt sprang towards her; her spirit could bear no more. She shrieked,\r\nshe woke. She found that in truth she had left that dismal chamber; the\r\ncradle was before her, the child! all--all as that trance had seen it;\r\nand, vanishing into air, even that dark, formless Thing!\r\n\r\n“My child! my child! thy mother shall save thee yet!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.VIII.\r\n\r\n     Qui?

No! stay, stay!)\r\n\r\nLetter from Viola to Zanoni.\r\n\r\n“It has come to this!--I am the first to part! I, the unfaithful one,\r\nbid thee farewell forever. When thine eyes fall upon this writing thou\r\nwilt know me as one of the dead. For thou that wert, and still art my\r\nlife,--I am lost to thee! O lover! O husband! O still worshipped and\r\nadored! if thou hast ever loved me, if thou canst still pity, seek not\r\nto discover the steps that fly thee. If thy charms can detect and tract\r\nme, spare me, spare our child! Zanoni, I will rear it to love thee, to\r\ncall thee father! Zanoni, its young lips shall pray for thee! Ah, spare\r\nthy child, for infants are the saints of earth, and their mediation\r\nmay be heard on high! Shall I tell thee why I part? No; thou, the\r\nwisely-terrible, canst divine what the hand trembles to record; and\r\nwhile I shudder at thy power,--while it is thy power I fly (our child\r\nupon my bosom),--it comforts me still to think that thy power can read\r\nthe heart! Thou knowest that it is the faithful mother that writes\r\nto thee, it is not the faithless wife! Is there sin in thy knowledge,\r\nZanoni? Sin must have sorrow: and it were sweet--oh, how sweet--to be\r\nthy comforter. But the child, the infant, the soul that looks to mine\r\nfor its shield!--magician, I wrest from thee that soul! Pardon, pardon,\r\nif my words wrong thee. See, I fall on my knees to write the rest!\r\n\r\n“Why did I never recoil before from thy mysterious lore; why did the\r\nvery strangeness of thine unearthly life only fascinate me with a\r\ndelightful fear? Because, if thou wert sorcerer or angel-demon, there\r\nwas no peril to other but myself: and none to me, for my love was my\r\nheavenliest part; and my ignorance in all things, except the art to love\r\nthee, repelled every thought that was not bright and glorious as thine\r\nimage to my eyes. But NOW there is another! Look! why does it watch me\r\nthus,--why that never-sleeping, earnest, rebuking gaze? Have thy spells\r\nencompassed it already? Hast thou marked it, cruel one, for the terrors\r\nof thy unutterable art? Do not madden me,--do not madden me!--unbind the\r\nspell!\r\n\r\n“Hark! the oars without! They come,--they come, to bear me from thee! I\r\nlook round, and methinks that I see thee everywhere. Thou speakest to\r\nme from every shadow, from every star. There, by the casement, thy lips\r\nlast pressed mine; there, there by that threshold didst thou turn again,\r\nand thy smile seemed so trustingly to confide in me! Zanoni--husband!--I\r\nwill stay! I cannot part from thee! No, no! I will go to the room\r\nwhere thy dear voice, with its gentle music, assuaged the pangs\r\nof travail!--where, heard through the thrilling darkness, it first\r\nwhispered to my ear, ‘Viola, thou art a mother!’ A mother!--yes, I rise\r\nfrom my knees,--I AM a mother! They come! I am firm; farewell!”\r\n\r\nYes; thus suddenly, thus cruelly, whether in the delirium of blind and\r\nunreasoning superstition, or in the resolve of that conviction which\r\nsprings from duty, the being for whom he had resigned so much of empire\r\nand of glory forsook Zanoni. This desertion, never foreseen, never\r\nanticipated, was yet but the constant fate that attends those who would\r\nplace Mind BEYOND the earth, and yet treasure the Heart WITHIN it.\r\nIgnorance everlastingly shall recoil from knowledge. But never yet, from\r\nnobler and purer motives of self-sacrifice, did human love link itself\r\nto another, than did the forsaking wife now abandon the absent. For\r\nrightly had she said that it was not the faithless wife, it WAS the\r\nfaithful mother that fled from all in which her earthly happiness was\r\ncentred.\r\n\r\nAs long as the passion and fervour that impelled the act animated\r\nher with false fever, she clasped her infant to her breast, and was\r\nconsoled,--resigned. But what bitter doubt of her own conduct, what icy\r\npang of remorse shot through her heart, when, as they rested for a\r\nfew hours on the road to Leghorn, she heard the woman who accompanied\r\nherself and Glyndon pray for safety to reach her husband’s side,\r\nand strength to share the perils that would meet her there! Terrible\r\ncontrast to her own desertion! She shrunk into the darkness of her own\r\nheart,--and then no voice from within consoled her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.IX.\r\n\r\n     Zukunft hast du mir gegeben,\r\n     Doch du nehmst den Augenblick.\r\n     “Kassandra.”\r\n\r\n     (Futurity hast thou given to me,--yet takest from me the Moment.)\r\n\r\n“Mejnour, behold thy work! Out, out upon our little vanities of\r\nwisdom!--out upon our ages of lore and life! To save her from Peril I\r\nleft her presence, and the Peril has seized her in its grasp!”\r\n\r\n“Chide not thy wisdom but thy passions! Abandon thine idle hope of the\r\nlove of woman. See, for those who would unite the lofty with the lowly,\r\nthe inevitable curse; thy very nature uncomprehended,--thy sacrifices\r\nunguessed. The lowly one views but in the lofty a necromancer or a\r\nfiend. Titan, canst thou weep?”\r\n\r\n“I know it now, I see it all! It WAS her spirit that stood beside\r\nour own, and escaped my airy clasp! O strong desire of motherhood\r\nand nature! unveiling all our secrets, piercing space and traversing\r\nworlds!--Mejnour, what awful learning lies hid in the ignorance of the\r\nheart that loves!”\r\n\r\n“The heart,” answered the mystic, coldly; “ay, for five thousand years I\r\nhave ransacked the mysteries of creation, but I have not yet discovered\r\nall the wonders in the heart of the simplest boor!”\r\n\r\n“Yet our solemn rites deceived us not; the prophet-shadows, dark with\r\nterror and red with blood, still foretold that, even in the dungeon, and\r\nbefore the deathsman, I,--I had the power to save them both!”\r\n\r\n“But at some unconjectured and most fatal sacrifice to thyself.”\r\n\r\n“To myself! Icy sage, there is no self in love! I go. Nay, alone: I\r\nwant thee not. I want now no other guide but the human instincts of\r\naffection. No cave so dark, no solitude so vast, as to conceal her.\r\nThough mine art fail me; though the stars heed me not; though space,\r\nwith its shining myriads, is again to me but the azure void,--I return\r\nbut to love and youth and hope! When have they ever failed to triumph\r\nand to save!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII. -- THE REIGN OF TERROR.\r\n\r\n     Orrida maesta nei fero aspetto\r\n     Terrore accresce, e piu superbo il rende;\r\n     Rosseggian gli occhi, e di veneno infetto\r\n     Come infausta cometa, il guardo splende,\r\n     Gil involve il mento, e sull ‘irsuto petto\r\n     Ispida efoita la gran barbe scende;\r\n     E IN GUISA DE VORAGINE PROFONDA\r\n     SAPRE LA BOCCA A’ATRO SANGUE IMMONDA.\r\n     (Ger.

How burst into blossoming hopes fair\r\nhearts that had nourished themselves on the diamond dews of the rosy\r\ndawn, when Liberty came from the dark ocean, and the arms of decrepit\r\nThraldom--Aurora from the bed of Tithon! Hopes! ye have ripened into\r\nfruit, and the fruit is gore and ashes!

Saturn hath devoured his children (“La Revolution\r\nest comme Saturne, elle devorera tous ses enfans.”--Vergniaud.), and\r\nlives alone,--I his true name of Moloch!\r\n\r\nIt is the Reign of Terror, with Robespierre the king. The struggles\r\nbetween the boa and the lion are past: the boa has consumed the lion,\r\nand is heavy with the gorge,--Danton has fallen, and Camille Desmoulins.\r\nDanton had said before his death, “The poltroon Robespierre,--I alone\r\ncould have saved him.” From that hour, indeed, the blood of the dead\r\ngiant clouded the craft of “Maximilien the Incorruptible,” as at last,\r\namidst the din of the roused Convention, it choked his voice. (“Le sang\r\nde Danton t’etouffe!” (the blood of Danton chokes thee!) said Garnier\r\nde l’Aube, when on the fatal 9th of Thermidor, Robespierre gasped feebly\r\nforth, “Pour la derniere fois, President des Assassins, je te demande\r\nla parole.” (For the last time, President of Assassins, I demand to\r\nspeak.)) If, after that last sacrifice, essential, perhaps, to his\r\nsafety, Robespierre had proclaimed the close of the Reign of Terror,\r\nand acted upon the mercy which Danton had begun to preach, he might have\r\nlived and died a monarch. But the prisons continued to reek,--the glaive\r\nto fall; and Robespierre perceived not that his mobs were glutted to\r\nsatiety with death, and the strongest excitement a chief could give\r\nwould be a return from devils into men.\r\n\r\nWe are transported to a room in the house of Citizen Dupleix, the\r\nmenuisier, in the month of July, 1794; or, in the calendar of the\r\nRevolutionists, it was the Thermidor of the Second Year of the Republic,\r\nOne and Indivisible! Though the room was small, it was furnished and\r\ndecorated with a minute and careful effort at elegance and refinement.\r\nIt seemed, indeed, the desire of the owner to avoid at once what was\r\nmean and rude, and what was luxurious and voluptuous. It was a trim,\r\norderly, precise grace that shaped the classic chairs, arranged the\r\nample draperies, sank the frameless mirrors into the wall, placed bust\r\nand bronze on their pedestals, and filled up the niches here and there\r\nwith well-bound books, filed regularly in their appointed ranks. An\r\nobserver would have said, “This man wishes to imply to you,--I am\r\nnot rich; I am not ostentatious; I am not luxurious; I am no indolent\r\nSybarite, with couches of down, and pictures that provoke the sense;\r\nI am no haughty noble, with spacious halls, and galleries that awe the\r\necho. But so much the greater is my merit if I disdain these excesses\r\nof the ease or the pride, since I love the elegant, and have a taste!\r\nOthers may be simple and honest, from the very coarseness of their\r\nhabits; if I, with so much refinement and delicacy, am simple and\r\nhonest,--reflect, and admire me!”\r\n\r\nOn the walls of this chamber hung many portraits, most of them\r\nrepresented but one face; on the formal pedestals were grouped many\r\nbusts, most of them sculptured but one head. In that small chamber\r\nEgotism sat supreme, and made the Arts its looking-glasses. Erect in\r\na chair, before a large table spread with letters, sat the original of\r\nbust and canvas, the owner of the apartment. He was alone, yet he sat\r\nerect, formal, stiff, precise, as if in his very home he was not at\r\nease. His dress was in harmony with his posture and his chamber; it\r\naffected a neatness of its own,--foreign both to the sumptuous fashions\r\nof the deposed nobles, and the filthy ruggedness of the sans-culottes.\r\nFrizzled and coiffe, not a hair was out of order, not a speck lodged\r\non the sleek surface of the blue coat, not a wrinkle crumpled the snowy\r\nvest, with its under-relief of delicate pink. At the first glance, you\r\nmight have seen in that face nothing but the ill-favoured features of a\r\nsickly countenance; at a second glance, you would have perceived that\r\nit had a power, a character of its own. The forehead, though low and\r\ncompressed, was not without that appearance of thought and intelligence\r\nwhich, it may be observed, that breadth between the eyebrows almost\r\ninvariably gives; the lips were firm and tightly drawn together, yet\r\never and anon they trembled, and writhed restlessly. The eyes, sullen\r\nand gloomy, were yet piercing, and full of a concentrated vigour that\r\ndid not seem supported by the thin, feeble frame, or the green lividness\r\nof the hues, which told of anxiety and disease.\r\n\r\nSuch was Maximilien Robespierre; such the chamber over the menuisier’s\r\nshop, whence issued the edicts that launched armies on their career of\r\nglory, and ordained an artificial conduit to carry off the blood that\r\ndeluged the metropolis of the most martial people in the globe! Such was\r\nthe man who had resigned a judicial appointment (the early object of\r\nhis ambition) rather than violate his philanthropical principles by\r\nsubscribing to the death of a single fellow-creature; such was the\r\nvirgin enemy to capital punishments; and such, Butcher-Dictator now, was\r\nthe man whose pure and rigid manners, whose incorruptible honesty, whose\r\nhatred of the excesses that tempt to love and wine, would, had he died\r\nfive years earlier, have left him the model for prudent fathers and\r\ncareful citizens to place before their sons. Such was the man who seemed\r\nto have no vice, till circumstance, that hotbed, brought forth the two\r\nwhich, in ordinary times, lie ever the deepest and most latent in a\r\nman’s heart,--Cowardice and Envy. To one of these sources is to be\r\ntraced every murder that master-fiend committed. His cowardice was of\r\na peculiar and strange sort; for it was accompanied with the most\r\nunscrupulous and determined WILL,--a will that Napoleon reverenced;\r\na will of iron, and yet nerves of aspen. Mentally, he was a\r\nhero,--physically, a dastard. When the veriest shadow of danger\r\nthreatened his person, the frame cowered, but the will swept the danger\r\nto the slaughter-house. So there he sat, bolt upright,--his small, lean\r\nfingers clenched convulsively; his sullen eyes straining into space,\r\ntheir whites yellowed with streaks of corrupt blood; his ears literally\r\nmoving to and fro, like the ignobler animals’, to catch every sound,--a\r\nDionysius in his cave; but his posture decorous and collected, and every\r\nformal hair in its frizzled place.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” he said in a muttered tone, “I hear them; my good Jacobins\r\nare at their post on the stairs. Pity they swear so! I have a law\r\nagainst oaths,--the manners of the poor and virtuous people must\r\nbe reformed. When all is safe, an example or two amongst those good\r\nJacobins would make effect. Faithful fellows, how they love me!\r\nHum!--what an oath was that!--they need not swear so loud,--upon the\r\nvery staircase, too! It detracts from my reputation. Ha! steps!”\r\n\r\nThe soliloquist glanced at the opposite mirror, and took up a volume;\r\nhe seemed absorbed in its contents, as a tall fellow, a bludgeon in his\r\nhand, a girdle adorned with pistols round his waist, opened the door,\r\nand announced two visitors. The one was a young man, said to resemble\r\nRobespierre in person, but of a far more decided and resolute expression\r\nof countenance. He entered first, and, looking over the volume in\r\nRobespierre’s hand, for the latter seemed still intent on his lecture,\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n“What! Rousseau’s Heloise? A love-tale!”\r\n\r\n“Dear Payan, it is not the love,--it is the philosophy that charms me.\r\nWhat noble sentiments!--what ardour of virtue! If Jean Jacques had but\r\nlived to see this day!”\r\n\r\nWhile the Dictator thus commented on his favourite author, whom in his\r\norations he laboured hard to imitate, the second visitor was wheeled\r\ninto the room in a chair. This man was also in what, to most, is the\r\nprime of life,--namely, about thirty-eight; but he was literally dead in\r\nthe lower limbs: crippled, paralytic, distorted, he was yet, as the time\r\nsoon came to tell him,--a Hercules in Crime! But the sweetest of human\r\nsmiles dwelt upon his lips; a beauty almost angelic characterised his\r\nfeatures (“Figure d’ange,” says one of his contemporaries, in describing\r\nCouthon. The address, drawn up most probably by Payan (Thermidor 9),\r\nafter the arrest of Robespierre, thus mentions his crippled colleague:\r\n“Couthon, ce citoyen vertueux, QUI N’A QUE LE COEUR ET LA TETE DE\r\nVIVANS, mais qui les a brulants de patriotisme” (Couthon, that virtuous\r\ncitizen, who has but the head and the heart of the living, yet possesses\r\nthese all on flame with patriotism.)); an inexpressible aspect of\r\nkindness, and the resignation of suffering but cheerful benignity, stole\r\ninto the hearts of those who for the first time beheld him. With the\r\nmost caressing, silver, flute-like voice, Citizen Couthon saluted the\r\nadmirer of Jean Jacques.\r\n\r\n“Nay,--do not say that it is not the LOVE that attracts thee; it IS the\r\nlove! but not the gross, sensual attachment of man for woman. No! the\r\nsublime affection for the whole human race, and indeed, for all that\r\nlives!”\r\n\r\nAnd Citizen Couthon, bending down, fondled the little spaniel that he\r\ninvariably carried in his bosom, even to the Convention, as a vent for\r\nthe exuberant sensibilities which overflowed his affectionate heart.\r\n(This tenderness for some pet animal was by no means peculiar to\r\nCouthon; it seems rather a common fashion with the gentle butchers of\r\nthe Revolution. M. George Duval informs us (“Souvenirs de la Terreur,”\r\n volume iii page 183) that Chaumette had an aviary, to which he devoted\r\nhis harmless leisure; the murderous Fournier carried on his shoulders a\r\npretty little squirrel, attached by a silver chain; Panis bestowed the\r\nsuperfluity of his affections upon two gold pheasants; and Marat, who\r\nwould not abate one of the three hundred thousand heads he demanded,\r\nREARED DOVES! Apropos of the spaniel of Couthon, Duval gives us an\r\namusing anecdote of Sergent, not one of the least relentless agents of\r\nthe massacre of September. A lady came to implore his protection for one\r\nof her relations confined in the Abbaye. He scarcely deigned to speak to\r\nher. As she retired in despair, she trod by accident on the paw of\r\nhis favourite spaniel. Sergent, turning round, enraged and furious,\r\nexclaimed, “MADAM, HAVE YOU NO HUMANITY?”)\r\n\r\n“Yes, for all that lives,” repeated Robespierre, tenderly.\r\n“Good Couthon,--poor Couthon! Ah, the malice of men!--how we are\r\nmisrepresented! To be calumniated as the executioners of our colleagues!\r\nAh, it is THAT which pierces the heart! To be an object of terror to the\r\nenemies of our country,--THAT is noble; but to be an object of terror\r\nto the good, the patriotic, to those one loves and reveres,--THAT is the\r\nmost terrible of human tortures at least, to a susceptible and honest\r\nheart!” (Not to fatigue the reader with annotations, I may here observe\r\nthat nearly every sentiment ascribed in the text to Robespierre is to be\r\nfound expressed in his various discourses.)\r\n\r\n“How I love to hear him!” ejaculated Couthon.\r\n\r\n“Hem!” said Payan, with some impatience. “But now to business!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, to business!” said Robespierre, with a sinister glance from his\r\nbloodshot eyes.\r\n\r\n“The time has come,” said Payan, “when the safety of the Republic\r\ndemands a complete concentration of its power. These brawlers of the\r\nComite du Salut Public can only destroy; they cannot construct. They\r\nhated you, Maximilien, from the moment you attempted to replace anarcy\r\nby institutions. How they mock at the festival which proclaimed the\r\nacknowledgment of a Supreme Being: they would have no ruler, even in\r\nheaven! Your clear and vigorous intellect saw that, having wrecked\r\nan old world, it became necessary to shape a new one. The first step\r\ntowards construction must be to destroy the destroyers. While we\r\ndeliberate, your enemies act. Better this very night to attack the\r\nhandful of gensdarmes that guard them, than to confront the battalions\r\nthey may raise to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Robespierre, who recoiled before the determined spirit of\r\nPayan; “I have a better and safer plan. This is the 6th of Thermidor;\r\non the 10th--on the 10th, the Convention go in a body to the Fete\r\nDecadaire. A mob shall form; the canonniers, the troops of Henriot, the\r\nyoung pupils de l’Ecole de Mars, shall mix in the crowd. Easy, then, to\r\nstrike the conspirators whom we shall designate to our agents. On the\r\nsame day, too, Fouquier and Dumas shall not rest; and a sufficient\r\nnumber of ‘the suspect’ to maintain salutary awe, and keep up the\r\nrevolutionary excitement, shall perish by the glaive of the law. The\r\n10th shall be the great day of action. Payan, of these last culprits,\r\nhave you prepared a list?”\r\n\r\n“It is here,” returned Payan, laconically, presenting a paper.\r\n\r\nRobespierre glanced over it rapidly. “Collot d’Herbois!--good!\r\nBarrere!--ay, it was Barrere who said, ‘Let us strike: the dead alone\r\nnever return.’ [‘Frappons! il n’y a que les morts qui ne revient\r\npas.’--Barrere.) Vadier, the savage jester!--good--good! Vadier of the\r\nMountain. He has called me ‘Mahomet!’ Scelerat! blasphemer!”\r\n\r\n“Mahomet is coming to the Mountain,” said Couthon, with his silvery\r\naccent, as he caressed his spaniel.\r\n\r\n“But how is this? I do not see the name of Tallien? Tallien,--I hate\r\nthat man; that is,” said Robespierre, correcting himself with the\r\nhypocrisy or self-deceit which those who formed the council of this\r\nphrase-monger exhibited habitually, even among themselves,--“that is,\r\nVirtue and our Country hate him! There is no man in the whole Convention\r\nwho inspires me with the same horror as Tallien. Couthon, I see a\r\nthousand Dantons where Tallien sits!”\r\n\r\n“Tallien has the only head that belongs to this deformed body,” said\r\nPayan, whose ferocity and crime, like those of St. Just, were not\r\nunaccompanied by talents of no common order. “Were it not better to\r\ndraw away the head, to win, to buy him, for the time, and dispose of him\r\nbetter when left alone? He may hate YOU, but he loves MONEY!”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Robespierre, writing down the name of Jean Lambert Tallien,\r\nwith a slow hand that shaped each letter with stern distinctness; “that\r\none head IS MY NECESSITY!”\r\n\r\n“I have a SMALL list here,” said Couthon, sweetly,--“a VERY small\r\nlist. You are dealing with the Mountain; it is necessary to make a few\r\nexamples in the Plain. These moderates are as straws which follow the\r\nwind. They turned against us yesterday in the Convention. A little\r\nterror will correct the weathercocks. Poor creatures! I owe them no\r\nill-will; I could weep for them. But before all, la chere patrie!”\r\n\r\nThe terrible glance of Robespierre devoured the list which the man of\r\nsensibility submitted to him. “Ah, these are well chosen; men not of\r\nmark enough to be regretted, which is the best policy with the relics\r\nof that party; some foreigners too,--yes, THEY have no parents in\r\nParis. These wives and parents are beginning to plead against us. Their\r\ncomplaints demoralise the guillotine!”\r\n\r\n“Couthon is right,” said Payan; “MY list contains those whom it will be\r\nsafer to despatch en masse in the crowd assembled at the Fete. HIS list\r\nselects those whom we may prudently consign to the law. Shall it not be\r\nsigned at once?”\r\n\r\n“It IS signed,” said Robespierre, formally replacing his pen upon the\r\ninkstand. “Now to more important matters. These deaths will create no\r\nexcitement; but Collot d’Herbois, Bourdon De l’Oise, Tallien,” the\r\nlast name Robespierre gasped as he pronounced, “THEY are the heads of\r\nparties. This is life or death to us as well as them.”\r\n\r\n“Their heads are the footstools to your curule chair,” said Payan, in\r\na half whisper. “There is no danger if we are bold. Judges, juries, all\r\nhave been your selection. You seize with one hand the army, with the\r\nother, the law. Your voice yet commands the people--”\r\n\r\n“The poor and virtuous people,” murmured Robespierre.\r\n\r\n“And even,” continued Payan, “if our design at the Fete fail us, we must\r\nnot shrink from the resources still at our command. Reflect! Henriot,\r\nthe general of the Parisian army, furnishes you with troops to arrest;\r\nthe Jacobin Club with a public to approve; inexorable Dumas with judges\r\nwho never acquit. We must be bold!”\r\n\r\n“And we ARE bold,” exclaimed Robespierre, with sudden passion, and\r\nstriking his hand on the table as he rose, with his crest erect, as a\r\nserpent in the act to strike. “In seeing the multitude of vices that\r\nthe revolutionary torrent mingles with civic virtues, I tremble to be\r\nsullied in the eyes of posterity by the impure neighbourhood of these\r\nperverse men who thrust themselves among the sincere defenders of\r\nhumanity. What!--they think to divide the country like a booty! I\r\nthank them for their hatred to all that is virtuous and worthy! These\r\nmen,”--and he grasped the list of Payan in his hand,--“these!--not\r\nWE--have drawn the line of demarcation between themselves and the lovers\r\nof France!”\r\n\r\n“True, we must reign alone!” muttered Payan; “in other words, the state\r\nneeds unity of will;” working, with his strong practical mind, the\r\ncorollary from the logic of his word-compelling colleague.\r\n\r\n“I will go to the Convention,” continued Robespierre. “I have absented\r\nmyself too long,--lest I might seem to overawe the Republic that I have\r\ncreated. Away with such scruples! I will prepare the people! I will\r\nblast the traitors with a look!”\r\n\r\nHe spoke with the terrible firmness of the orator that had never\r\nfailed,--of the moral will that marched like a warrior on the cannon. At\r\nthat instant he was interrupted; a letter was brought to him: he opened\r\nit,--his face fell, he shook from limb to limb; it was one of the\r\nanonymous warnings by which the hate and revenge of those yet left alive\r\nto threaten tortured the death-giver.\r\n\r\n“Thou art smeared,” ran the lines, “with the best blood of France. Read\r\nthy sentence! I await the hour when the people shall knell thee to the\r\ndoomsman. If my hope deceive me, if deferred too long,--hearken, read!\r\nThis hand, which thine eyes shall search in vain to discover, shall\r\npierce thy heart. I see thee every day,--I am with thee every day. At\r\neach hour my arm rises against thy breast. Wretch! live yet awhile,\r\nthough but for few and miserable days--live to think of me; sleep to\r\ndream of me! Thy terror and thy thought of me are the heralds of thy\r\ndoom. Adieu! this day itself I go forth to riot on thy fears!” (See\r\n“Papiers inedits trouves chez Robespierre,” etc., volume ii. page 155.\r\n(No. lx.))\r\n\r\n“Your lists are not full enough!” said the tyrant, with a hollow voice,\r\nas the paper dropped from his trembling hand. “Give them to me!--give\r\nthem to me! Think again, think again! Barrere is right--right!\r\n‘Frappons! il n’y a que les morts qui ne revient pas!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.II.\r\n\r\n     La haine, dans ces lieux, n’a qu’un glaive assassin.\r\n     Elle marche dans l’ombre.\r\n     La Harpe, “Jeanne de Naples,” Act iv. sc. 1.\r\n\r\n     (Hate, in these regions, has but the sword of the assassin.  She\r\n     moves in the shade.)\r\n\r\nWhile such the designs and fears of Maximilien Robespierre, common\r\ndanger, common hatred, whatever was yet left of mercy or of virtue\r\nin the agents of the Revolution, served to unite strange opposites in\r\nhostility to the universal death-dealer. There was, indeed, an actual\r\nconspiracy at work against him among men little less bespattered than\r\nhimself with innocent blood. But that conspiracy would have been idle of\r\nitself, despite the abilities of Tallien and Barras (the only men whom\r\nit comprised, worthy, by foresight and energy, the names of “leaders”).\r\nThe sure and destroying elements that gathered round the tyrant were\r\nTime and Nature; the one, which he no longer suited; the other, which\r\nhe had outraged and stirred up in the human breast. The most atrocious\r\nparty of the Revolution, the followers of Hebert, gone to his last\r\naccount, the butcher-atheists, who, in desecrating heaven and earth,\r\nstill arrogated inviolable sanctity to themselves, were equally enraged\r\nat the execution of their filthy chief, and the proclamation of a\r\nSupreme Being. The populace, brutal as it had been, started as from a\r\ndream of blood, when their huge idol, Danton, no longer filled the\r\nstage of terror, rendering crime popular by that combination of careless\r\nfrankness and eloquent energy which endears their heroes to the herd.\r\nThe glaive of the guillotine had turned against THEMSELVES. They had\r\nyelled and shouted, and sung and danced, when the venerable age, or the\r\ngallant youth, of aristocracy or letters, passed by their streets in\r\nthe dismal tumbrils; but they shut up their shops, and murmured to each\r\nother, when their own order was invaded, and tailors and cobblers, and\r\njourneymen and labourers, were huddled off to the embraces of the “Holy\r\nMother Guillotine,” with as little ceremony as if they had been the\r\nMontmorencies or the La Tremouilles, the Malesherbes or the Lavoisiers.\r\n“At this time,” said Couthon, justly, “Les ombres de Danton, d’Hebert,\r\nde Chaumette, se promenent parmi nous!” (The shades of Danton, Hebert,\r\nand Chaumette walk amongst us.)\r\n\r\nAmong those who had shared the doctrines, and who now dreaded the\r\nfate of the atheist Hebert, was the painter, Jean Nicot. Mortified and\r\nenraged to find that, by the death of his patron, his career was closed;\r\nand that, in the zenith of the Revolution for which he had laboured,\r\nhe was lurking in caves and cellars, more poor, more obscure, more\r\ndespicable than he had been at the commencement,--not daring to exercise\r\neven his art, and fearful every hour that his name would swell the lists\r\nof the condemned,--he was naturally one of the bitterest enemies of\r\nRobespierre and his government. He held secret meetings with Collot\r\nd’Herbois, who was animated by the same spirit; and with the creeping\r\nand furtive craft that characterised his abilities, he contrived,\r\nundetected, to disseminate tracts and invectives against the Dictator,\r\nand to prepare, amidst “the poor and virtuous people,” the train for\r\nthe grand explosion. But still so firm to the eyes, even of profounder\r\npoliticians than Jean Nicot, appeared the sullen power of the\r\nincorruptible Maximilien; so timorous was the movement against\r\nhim,--that Nicot, in common with many others, placed his hopes rather in\r\nthe dagger of the assassin than the revolt of the multitude. But Nicot,\r\nthough not actually a coward, shrunk himself from braving the fate of\r\nthe martyr; he had sense enough to see that, though all parties might\r\nrejoice in the assassination, all parties would probably concur in\r\nbeheading the assassin. He had not the virtue to become a Brutus.\r\nHis object was to inspire a proxy-Brutus; and in the centre of that\r\ninflammable population this was no improbable hope.\r\n\r\nAmongst those loudest and sternest against the reign of blood; amongst\r\nthose most disenchanted of the Revolution; amongst those most appalled\r\nby its excesses,--was, as might be expected, the Englishman, Clarence\r\nGlyndon. The wit and accomplishments, the uncertain virtues that\r\nhad lighted with fitful gleams the mind of Camille Desmoulins, had\r\nfascinated Glyndon more than the qualities of any other agent in the\r\nRevolution. And when (for Camille Desmoulins had a heart, which seemed\r\ndead or dormant in most of his contemporaries) that vivid child of\r\ngenius and of error, shocked at the massacre of the Girondins, and\r\nrepentant of his own efforts against them, began to rouse the serpent\r\nmalice of Robespierre by new doctrines of mercy and toleration, Glyndon\r\nespoused his views with his whole strength and soul. Camille Desmoulins\r\nperished, and Glyndon, hopeless at once of his own life and the cause\r\nof humanity, from that time sought only the occasion of flight from the\r\ndevouring Golgotha. He had two lives to heed besides his own; for them\r\nhe trembled, and for them he schemed and plotted the means of escape.\r\nThough Glyndon hated the principles, the party (None were more opposed\r\nto the Hebertists than Camille Desmoulins and his friends. It is curious\r\nand amusing to see these leaders of the mob, calling the mob “the\r\npeople” one day, and the “canaille” the next, according as it suits\r\nthem. “I know,” says Camille, “that they (the Hebertists) have all the\r\ncanaille with them.”--(Ils ont toute la canaille pour eux.)), and the\r\nvices of Nicot, he yet extended to the painter’s penury the means of\r\nsubsistence; and Jean Nicot, in return, designed to exalt Glyndon\r\nto that very immortality of a Brutus from which he modestly recoiled\r\nhimself. He founded his designs on the physical courage, on the wild and\r\nunsettled fancies of the English artist, and on the vehement hate and\r\nindignant loathing with which he openly regarded the government of\r\nMaximilien.\r\n\r\nAt the same hour, on the same day in July, in which Robespierre\r\nconferred (as we have seen) with his allies, two persons were seated in\r\na small room in one of the streets leading out of the Rue St. Honore;\r\nthe one, a man, appeared listening impatiently, and with a sullen\r\nbrow, to his companion, a woman of singular beauty, but with a bold\r\nand reckless expression, and her face as she spoke was animated by the\r\npassions of a half-savage and vehement nature.\r\n\r\n“Englishman,” said the woman, “beware!--you know that, whether in flight\r\nor at the place of death, I would brave all to be by your side,--you\r\nknow THAT! Speak!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Fillide; did I ever doubt your fidelity?”\r\n\r\n“Doubt it you cannot,--betray it you may. You tell me that in flight you\r\nmust have a companion besides myself, and that companion is a female. It\r\nshall not be!”\r\n\r\n“Shall not!”\r\n\r\n“It shall not!” repeated Fillide, firmly, and folding her arms across\r\nher breast. Before Glyndon could reply, a slight knock at the door was\r\nheard, and Nicot opened the latch and entered.\r\n\r\nFillide sank into her chair, and, leaning her face on her hands,\r\nappeared unheeding of the intruder and the conversation that ensued.\r\n\r\n“I cannot bid thee good-day, Glyndon,” said Nicot, as in his\r\nsans-culotte fashion he strode towards the artist, his ragged hat on his\r\nhead, his hands in his pockets, and the beard of a week’s growth upon\r\nhis chin,--“I cannot bid thee good-day; for while the tyrant lives, evil\r\nis every sun that sheds its beams on France.”\r\n\r\n“It is true; what then? We have sown the wind, we must reap the\r\nwhirlwind.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said Nicot, apparently not heeding the reply, and as if\r\nmusingly to himself, “it is strange to think that the butcher is as\r\nmortal as the butchered; that his life hangs on as slight a thread; that\r\nbetween the cuticle and the heart there is as short a passage,--that, in\r\nshort, one blow can free France and redeem mankind!”\r\n\r\nGlyndon surveyed the speaker with a careless and haughty scorn, and made\r\nno answer.\r\n\r\n“And,” proceeded Nicot, “I have sometimes looked round for the man born\r\nfor this destiny, and whenever I have done so, my steps have led me\r\nhither!”\r\n\r\n“Should they not rather have led thee to the side of Maximilien\r\nRobespierre?” said Glyndon, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n“No,” returned Nicot, coldly,--“no; for I am a ‘suspect:’ I could not\r\nmix with his train; I could not approach within a hundred yards of his\r\nperson, but I should be seized; YOU, as yet, are safe. Hear me!”--and\r\nhis voice became earnest and expressive,--“hear me! There seems danger\r\nin this action; there is none. I have been with Collot d’Herbois and\r\nBilaud-Varennes; they will hold him harmless who strikes the blow; the\r\npopulace would run to thy support; the Convention would hail thee as\r\ntheir deliverer, the--”\r\n\r\n“Hold, man! How darest thou couple my name with the act of an assassin?\r\nLet the tocsin sound from yonder tower, to a war between Humanity and\r\nthe Tyrant, and I will not be the last in the field; but liberty never\r\nyet acknowledged a defender in a felon.”\r\n\r\nThere was something so brave and noble in Glyndon’s voice, mien, and\r\nmanner, as he thus spoke, that Nicot at once was silenced; at once he\r\nsaw that he had misjudged the man.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Fillide, lifting her face from her hands,--“no! your friend\r\nhas a wiser scheme in preparation; he would leave you wolves to mangle\r\neach other. He is right; but--”\r\n\r\n“Flight!” exclaimed Nicot; “is it possible? Flight; how?--when?--by what\r\nmeans? All France begirt with spies and guards! Flight! would to Heaven\r\nit were in our power!”\r\n\r\n“Dost thou, too, desire to escape the blessed Revolution?”\r\n\r\n“Desire! Oh!” cried Nicot, suddenly, and, falling down, he clasped\r\nGlyndon’s knees,--“oh, save me with thyself! My life is a torture;\r\nevery moment the guillotine frowns before me. I know that my hours are\r\nnumbered; I know that the tyrant waits but his time to write my name\r\nin his inexorable list; I know that Rene Dumas, the judge who never\r\npardons, has, from the first, resolved upon my death. Oh, Glyndon, by\r\nour old friendship, by our common art, by thy loyal English faith and\r\ngood English heart, let me share thy flight!”\r\n\r\n“If thou wilt, so be it.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks!--my whole life shall thank thee. But how hast thou prepared the\r\nmeans, the passports, the disguise, the--”\r\n\r\n“I will tell thee. Thou knowest C--, of the Convention,--he has power,\r\nand he is covetous. ‘Qu’on me meprise, pourvu que je dine’ (Let them\r\ndespise me, provided that I dine.), said he, when reproached for his\r\navarice.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“By the help of this sturdy republican, who has friends enough in the\r\nComite, I have obtained the means necessary for flight; I have purchased\r\nthem. For a consideration I can procure thy passport also.”\r\n\r\n“Thy riches, then, are not in assignats?”\r\n\r\n“No; I have gold enough for us all.”\r\n\r\nAnd here Glyndon, beckoning Nicot into the next room, first briefly\r\nand rapidly detailed to him the plan proposed, and the disguises to be\r\nassumed conformably to the passports, and then added, “In return for\r\nthe service I render thee, grant me one favour, which I think is in thy\r\npower. Thou rememberest Viola Pisani?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,--remember, yes!--and the lover with whom she fled.”\r\n\r\n“And FROM whom she is a fugitive now.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed--what!--I understand. Sacre bleu! but you are a lucky fellow,\r\ncher confrere.”\r\n\r\n“Silence, man! with thy eternal prate of brotherhood and virtue, thou\r\nseemest never to believe in one kindly action, or one virtuous thought!”\r\n\r\nNicot bit his lip, and replied sullenly, “Experience is a great\r\nundeceiver. Humph! What service can I do thee with regard to the\r\nItalian?”\r\n\r\n“I have been accessory to her arrival in this city of snares and\r\npitfalls. I cannot leave her alone amidst dangers from which neither\r\ninnocence nor obscurity is a safeguard. In your blessed Republic, a good\r\nand unsuspected citizen, who casts a desire on any woman, maid or wife,\r\nhas but to say, ‘Be mine, or I denounce you!’ In a word, Viola must\r\nshare our flight.”\r\n\r\n“What so easy? I see your passports provide for her.”\r\n\r\n“What so easy? What so difficult? This Fillide--would that I had never\r\nseen her!--would that I had never enslaved my soul to my senses! The\r\nlove of an uneducated, violent, unprincipled woman, opens with a heaven,\r\nto merge in a hell! She is jealous as all the Furies; she will not hear\r\nof a female companion; and when once she sees the beauty of Viola!--I\r\ntremble to think of it. She is capable of any excess in the storm of her\r\npassions.”\r\n\r\n“Aha, I know what such women are! My wife, Beatrice Sacchini, whom I\r\ntook from Naples, when I failed with this very Viola, divorced me when\r\nmy money failed, and, as the mistress of a judge, passes me in her\r\ncarriage while I crawl through the streets. Plague on her!--but\r\npatience, patience! such is the lot of virtue. Would I were Robespierre\r\nfor a day!”\r\n\r\n“Cease these tirades!” exclaimed Glyndon, impatiently; “and to the\r\npoint. What would you advise?”\r\n\r\n“Leave your Fillide behind.”\r\n\r\n“Leave her to her own ignorance; leave her unprotected even by the\r\nmind; leave her in the Saturnalia of Rape and Murder? No! I have sinned\r\nagainst her once. But come what may, I will not so basely desert one\r\nwho, with all her errors, trusted her fate to my love.”\r\n\r\n“You deserted her at Marseilles.”\r\n\r\n“True; but I left her in safety, and I did not then believe her love to\r\nbe so deep and faithful. I left her gold, and I imagined she would be\r\neasily consoled; but since THEN WE HAVE KNOWN DANGER TOGETHER! And now\r\nto leave her alone to that danger which she would never have incurred\r\nbut for devotion to me!--no, that is impossible. A project occurs to\r\nme. Canst thou not say that thou hast a sister, a relative, or a\r\nbenefactress, whom thou wouldst save? Can we not--till we have left\r\nFrance--make Fillide believe that Viola is one in whom THOU only art\r\ninterested; and whom, for thy sake only, I permit to share in our\r\nescape?”\r\n\r\n“Ha, well thought of!--certainly!”\r\n\r\n“I will then appear to yield to Fillide’s wishes, and resign the\r\nproject, which she so resents, of saving the innocent object of her\r\nfrantic jealousy. You, meanwhile, shall yourself entreat Fillide to\r\nintercede with me to extend the means of escape to--”\r\n\r\n“To a lady (she knows I have no sister) who has aided me in my distress.\r\nYes, I will manage all, never fear. One word more,--what has become of\r\nthat Zanoni?”\r\n\r\n“Talk not of him,--I know not.”\r\n\r\n“Does he love this girl still?”\r\n\r\n“It would seem so. She is his wife, the mother of his infant, who is\r\nwith her.”\r\n\r\n“Wife!--mother! He loves her. Aha! And why--”\r\n\r\n“No questions now. I will go and prepare Viola for the flight; you,\r\nmeanwhile, return to Fillide.”\r\n\r\n“But the address of the Neapolitan? It is necessary I should know, lest\r\nFillide inquire.”\r\n\r\n“Rue M-- T--, No. 27. Adieu.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon seized his hat and hastened from the house.\r\n\r\nNicot, left alone, seemed for a few moments buried in thought. “Oho,” he\r\nmuttered to himself, “can I not turn all this to my account? Can I not\r\navenge myself on thee, Zanoni, as I have so often sworn,--through thy\r\nwife and child? Can I not possess myself of thy gold, thy passports,\r\nand thy Fillide, hot Englishman, who wouldst humble me with thy loathed\r\nbenefits, and who hast chucked me thine alms as to a beggar? And\r\nFillide, I love her: and thy gold, I love THAT more! Puppets, I move\r\nyour strings!”\r\n\r\nHe passed slowly into the chamber where Fillide yet sat, with gloomy\r\nthought on her brow and tears standing in her dark eyes. She looked up\r\neagerly as the door opened, and turned from the rugged face of Nicot\r\nwith an impatient movement of disappointment.\r\n\r\n“Glyndon,” said the painter, drawing a chair to Fillide’s, “has left me\r\nto enliven your solitude, fair Italian. He is not jealous of the ugly\r\nNicot!--ha, ha!--yet Nicot loved thee well once, when his fortunes were\r\nmore fair. But enough of such past follies.”\r\n\r\n“Your friend, then, has left the house. Whither? Ah, you look away;\r\nyou falter,--you cannot meet my eyes! Speak! I implore, I command thee,\r\nspeak!”\r\n\r\n“Enfant! And what dost thou fear?”\r\n\r\n“FEAR!--yes, alas, I fear!” said the Italian; and her whole frame seemed\r\nto shrink into itself as she fell once more back into her seat.\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, she tossed the long hair from her eyes, and,\r\nstarting up abruptly, paced the room with disordered strides. At length\r\nshe stopped opposite to Nicot, laid her hand on his arm, drew him\r\ntowards an escritoire, which she unlocked, and, opening a well, pointed\r\nto the gold that lay within, and said, “Thou art poor,--thou lovest\r\nmoney; take what thou wilt, but undeceive me. Who is this woman whom thy\r\nfriend visits,--and does he love her?”\r\n\r\nNicot’s eyes sparkled, and his hands opened and clenched, and clenched\r\nand opened, as he gazed upon the coins. But reluctantly resisting the\r\nimpulse, he said, with an affected bitterness, “Thinkest thou to bribe\r\nme?--if so, it cannot be with gold. But what if he does love a rival;\r\nwhat if he betrays thee; what if, wearied by thy jealousies, he designs\r\nin his flight to leave thee behind,--would such knowledge make thee\r\nhappier?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” exclaimed the Italian, fiercely; “yes, for it would be happiness\r\nto hate and to be avenged! Oh, thou knowest not how sweet is hatred to\r\nthose who have really loved!”\r\n\r\n“But wilt thou swear, if I reveal to thee the secret, that thou wilt not\r\nbetray me,--that thou wilt not fall, as women do, into weak tears and\r\nfond reproaches, when thy betrayer returns?”\r\n\r\n“Tears, reproaches! Revenge hides itself in smiles!”\r\n\r\n“Thou art a brave creature!” said Nicot, almost admiringly. “One\r\ncondition more: thy lover designs to fly with his new love, to leave\r\nthee to thy fate; if I prove this to thee, and if I give thee revenge\r\nagainst thy rival, wilt thou fly with me? I love thee!--I will wed\r\nthee!”\r\n\r\nFillide’s eyes flashed fire; she looked at him with unutterable disdain,\r\nand was silent.\r\n\r\nNicot felt he had gone too far; and with that knowledge of the evil part\r\nof our nature which his own heart and association with crime had taught\r\nhim, he resolved to trust the rest to the passions of the Italian, when\r\nraised to the height to which he was prepared to lead them.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” he said; “my love made me too presumptuous; and yet it is\r\nonly that love,--my sympathy for thee, beautiful and betrayed, that can\r\ninduce me to wrong, with my revelations, one whom I have regarded as a\r\nbrother. I can depend upon thine oath to conceal all from Glyndon?”\r\n\r\n“On my oath and my wrongs and my mountain blood!”\r\n\r\n“Enough! get thy hat and mantle, and follow me.”\r\n\r\nAs Fillide left the room, Nicot’s eyes again rested on the gold; it was\r\nmuch,--much more than he had dared to hope for; and as he peered into\r\nthe well and opened the drawers, he perceived a packet of letters in the\r\nwell-known hand of Camille Desmoulins. He seized--he opened the packet;\r\nhis looks brightened as he glanced over a few sentences. “This would\r\ngive fifty Glyndons to the guillotine!” he muttered, and thrust the\r\npacket into his bosom.\r\n\r\nO artist!--O haunted one!--O erring genius!--behold the two worst\r\nfoes,--the False Ideal that knows no God, and the False Love that burns\r\nfrom the corruption of the senses, and takes no lustre from the soul!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.III.\r\n\r\n     Liebe sonnt das Reich der Nacht.\r\n     “Der Triumph der Liebe.”\r\n\r\n     (Love illumes the realm of Night.)\r\n\r\nLetter from Zanoni to Mejnour.\r\n\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nDost thou remember in the old time, when the Beautiful yet dwelt in\r\nGreece, how we two, in the vast Athenian Theatre, witnessed the birth of\r\nWords as undying as ourselves? Dost thou remember the thrill of terror\r\nthat ran through that mighty audience, when the wild Cassandra burst\r\nfrom her awful silence to shriek to her relentless god! How ghastly, at\r\nthe entrance of the House of Atreus, about to become her tomb, rang out\r\nher exclamations of foreboding woe: “Dwelling abhorred of heaven!--human\r\nshamble-house and floor blood-bespattered!” (Aesch. “Agam.” 1098.)\r\nDost thou remember how, amidst the breathless awe of those assembled\r\nthousands, I drew close to thee, and whispered, “Verily, no prophet like\r\nthe poet! This scene of fabled horror comes to me as a dream, shadowing\r\nforth some likeness in my own remoter future!” As I enter this\r\nslaughter-house that scene returns to me, and I hearken to the voice of\r\nCassandra ringing in my ears. A solemn and warning dread gathers round\r\nme, as if I too were come to find a grave, and “the Net of Hades”\r\n had already entangled me in its web! What dark treasure-houses of\r\nvicissitude and woe are our memories become! What our lives, but the\r\nchronicles of unrelenting death! It seems to me as yesterday when I\r\nstood in the streets of this city of the Gaul, as they shone with plumed\r\nchivalry, and the air rustled with silken braveries. Young Louis, the\r\nmonarch and the lover, was victor of the Tournament at the Carousel; and\r\nall France felt herself splendid in the splendour of her gorgeous chief!\r\nNow there is neither throne nor altar; and what is in their stead? I\r\nsee it yonder--the GUILLOTINE! It is dismal to stand amidst the ruins\r\nof mouldering cities, to startle the serpent and the lizard amidst\r\nthe wrecks of Persepolis and Thebes; but more dismal still to stand as\r\nI--the stranger from Empires that have ceased to be--stand now amidst\r\nthe yet ghastlier ruins of Law and Order, the shattering of mankind\r\nthemselves! Yet here, even here, Love, the Beautifier, that hath led my\r\nsteps, can walk with unshrinking hope through the wilderness of Death.\r\nStrange is the passion that makes a world in itself, that individualises\r\nthe One amidst the Multitude; that, through all the changes of my solemn\r\nlife, yet survives, though ambition and hate and anger are dead; the one\r\nsolitary angel, hovering over a universe of tombs on its two tremulous\r\nand human wings,--Hope and Fear!\r\n\r\nHow is it, Mejnour, that, as my diviner art abandoned me,--as, in my\r\nsearch for Viola, I was aided but by the ordinary instincts of the\r\nmerest mortal,--how is it that I have never desponded, that I have felt\r\nin every difficulty the prevailing prescience that we should meet at\r\nlast? So cruelly was every vestige of her flight concealed from\r\nme,--so suddenly, so secretly had she fled, that all the spies, all the\r\nauthorities of Venice, could give me no clew. All Italy I searched in\r\nvain! Her young home at Naples!--how still, in its humble chambers,\r\nthere seemed to linger the fragrance of her presence! All the sublimest\r\nsecrets of our lore failed me,--failed to bring her soul visible to\r\nmine; yet morning and night, thou lone and childless one, morning and\r\nnight, detached from myself, I can commune with my child! There in that\r\nmost blessed, typical, and mysterious of all relations, Nature herself\r\nappears to supply what Science would refuse. Space cannot separate the\r\nfather’s watchful soul from the cradle of his first-born! I know not of\r\nits resting-place and home,--my visions picture not the land,--only the\r\nsmall and tender life to which all space is as yet the heritage! For to\r\nthe infant, before reason dawns,--before man’s bad passions can dim\r\nthe essence that it takes from the element it hath left, there is no\r\npeculiar country, no native city, and no mortal language. Its soul as\r\nyet is the denizen of all airs and of every world; and in space its\r\nsoul meets with mine,--the child communes with the father! Cruel and\r\nforsaking one,--thou for whom I left the wisdom of the spheres;\r\nthou whose fatal dower has been the weakness and terrors of\r\nhumanity,--couldst thou think that young soul less safe on earth because\r\nI would lead it ever more up to heaven! Didst thou think that I could\r\nhave wronged mine own? Didst thou not know that in its serenest eyes the\r\nlife that I gave it spoke to warn, to upbraid the mother who would bind\r\nit to the darkness and pangs of the prison-house of clay? Didst thou\r\nnot feel that it was I who, permitted by the Heavens, shielded it from\r\nsuffering and disease? And in its wondrous beauty, I blessed the holy\r\nmedium through which, at last, my spirit might confer with thine!\r\n\r\nAnd how have I tracked them hither? I learned that thy pupil had been at\r\nVenice. I could not trace the young and gentle neophyte of Parthenope in\r\nthe description of the haggard and savage visitor who had come to Viola\r\nbefore she fled; but when I would have summoned his IDEA before me, it\r\nrefused to obey; and I knew then that his fate had become entwined with\r\nViola’s. I have tracked him, then, to this Lazar House. I arrived but\r\nyesterday; I have not yet discovered him.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nI have just returned from their courts of justice,--dens where tigers\r\narraign their prey. I find not whom I would seek. They are saved as\r\nyet; but I recognise in the crimes of mortals the dark wisdom of the\r\nEverlasting. Mejnour, I see here, for the first time, how majestic and\r\nbeauteous a thing is death! Of what sublime virtues we robbed ourselves,\r\nwhen, in the thirst for virtue, we attained the art by which we can\r\nrefuse to die! When in some happy clime, where to breathe is to enjoy,\r\nthe charnel-house swallows up the young and fair; when in the noble\r\npursuit of knowledge, Death comes to the student, and shuts out the\r\nenchanted land which was opening to his gaze,--how natural for us to\r\ndesire to live; how natural to make perpetual life the first object of\r\nresearch! But here, from my tower of time, looking over the darksome\r\npast, and into the starry future, I learn how great hearts feel what\r\nsweetness and glory there is to die for the things they love! I saw\r\na father sacrificing himself for his son; he was subjected to charges\r\nwhich a word of his could dispel,--he was mistaken for his boy. With\r\nwhat joy he seized the error, confessed the noble crimes of valour\r\nand fidelity which the son had indeed committed, and went to the doom,\r\nexulting that his death saved the life he had given, not in vain! I saw\r\nwomen, young, delicate, in the bloom of their beauty; they had vowed\r\nthemselves to the cloister. Hands smeared with the blood of saints\r\nopened the gate that had shut them from the world, and bade them go\r\nforth, forget their vows, forswear the Divine one these demons would\r\ndepose, find lovers and helpmates, and be free. And some of these young\r\nhearts had loved, and even, though in struggles, loved yet. Did they\r\nforswear the vow? Did they abandon the faith? Did even love allure them?\r\nMejnour, with one voice, they preferred to die. And whence comes this\r\ncourage?--because such HEARTS LIVE IN SOME MORE ABSTRACT AND HOLIER\r\nLIFE THAN THEIR OWN. BUT TO LIVE FOREVER UPON THIS EARTH IS TO LIVE IN\r\nNOTHING DIVINER THAN OURSELVES. Yes, even amidst this gory butcherdom,\r\nGod, the Ever-living, vindicates to man the sanctity of His servant,\r\nDeath!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nAgain I have seen thee in spirit; I have seen and blessed thee, my sweet\r\nchild! Dost thou not know me also in thy dreams? Dost thou not feel the\r\nbeating of my heart through the veil of thy rosy slumbers? Dost thou\r\nnot hear the wings of the brighter beings that I yet can conjure around\r\nthee, to watch, to nourish, and to save? And when the spell fades at thy\r\nwaking, when thine eyes open to the day, will they not look round for\r\nme, and ask thy mother, with their mute eloquence, “Why she has robbed\r\nthee of a father?”\r\n\r\nWoman, dost thou not repent thee? Flying from imaginary fears, hast\r\nthou not come to the very lair of terror, where Danger sits visible\r\nand incarnate? Oh, if we could but meet, wouldst thou not fall upon the\r\nbosom thou hast so wronged, and feel, poor wanderer amidst the storms,\r\nas if thou hadst regained the shelter? Mejnour, still my researches\r\nfail me. I mingle with all men, even their judges and their spies, but\r\nI cannot yet gain the clew. I know that she is here. I know it by an\r\ninstinct; the breath of my child seems warmer and more familiar.\r\n\r\nThey peer at me with venomous looks, as I pass through their streets.\r\nWith a glance I disarm their malice, and fascinate the basilisks.\r\nEverywhere I see the track and scent the presence of the Ghostly One\r\nthat dwells on the Threshold, and whose victims are the souls that would\r\nASPIRE, and can only FEAR. I see its dim shapelessness going before the\r\nmen of blood, and marshalling their way. Robespierre passed me with his\r\nfurtive step. Those eyes of horror were gnawing into his heart. I looked\r\ndown upon their senate; the grim Phantom sat cowering on its floor.\r\nIt hath taken up its abode in the city of Dread. And what in truth\r\nare these would-be builders of a new world? Like the students who have\r\nvainly struggled after our supreme science, they have attempted what is\r\nbeyond their power; they have passed from this solid earth of usages and\r\nforms into the land of shadow, and its loathsome keeper has seized them\r\nas its prey. I looked into the tyrant’s shuddering soul, as it trembled\r\npast me. There, amidst the ruins of a thousand systems which aimed at\r\nvirtue, sat Crime, and shivered at its desolation. Yet this man is the\r\nonly Thinker, the only Aspirant, amongst them all. He still looks for\r\na future of peace and mercy, to begin,--ay! at what date? When he has\r\nswept away every foe. Fool! new foes spring from every drop of blood.\r\nLed by the eyes of the Unutterable, he is walking to his doom.\r\n\r\nO Viola, thy innocence protects thee! Thou whom the sweet humanities\r\nof love shut out even from the dreams of aerial and spiritual beauty,\r\nmaking thy heart a universe of visions fairer than the wanderer over the\r\nrosy Hesperus can survey,--shall not the same pure affection encompass\r\nthee, even here, with a charmed atmosphere, and terror itself fall\r\nharmless on a life too innocent for wisdom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.IV.\r\n\r\n     Ombra piu che di notte, in cui di luce\r\n     Raggio misto non e;\r\n\r\n     ....\r\n\r\n     Ne piu il palagio appar, ne piu le sue\r\n     Vestigia; ne dir puossi--egli qui fue.\r\n     --“Ger. Lib.”, canto xvi.-lxix.\r\n\r\n     (Darkness greater than of night, in which not a ray of light is\r\n     mixed;...The palace appears no more:  not even a vestige,--nor\r\n     can one say that it has been.)\r\n\r\nThe clubs are noisy with clamorous frenzy; the leaders are grim with\r\nschemes. Black Henriot flies here and there, muttering to his armed\r\ntroops, “Robespierre, your beloved, is in danger!” Robespierre stalks\r\nperturbed, his list of victims swelling every hour. Tallien, the Macduff\r\nto the doomed Macbeth, is whispering courage to his pale conspirators.\r\nAlong the streets heavily roll the tumbrils. The shops are closed,--the\r\npeople are gorged with gore, and will lap no more. And night after\r\nnight, to the eighty theatres flock the children of the Revolution, to\r\nlaugh at the quips of comedy, and weep gentle tears over imaginary woes!\r\n\r\nIn a small chamber, in the heart of the city, sits the mother, watching\r\nover her child. It is quiet, happy noon; the sunlight, broken by the\r\ntall roofs in the narrow street, comes yet through the open casement,\r\nthe impartial playfellow of the air, gleesome alike in temple and\r\nprison, hall and hovel; as golden and as blithe, whether it laugh over\r\nthe first hour of life, or quiver in its gay delight on the terror\r\nand agony of the last! The child, where it lay at the feet of Viola,\r\nstretched out its dimpled hands as if to clasp the dancing motes that\r\nrevelled in the beam. The mother turned her eyes from the glory; it\r\nsaddened her yet more. She turned and sighed.\r\n\r\nIs this the same Viola who bloomed fairer than their own Idalia under\r\nthe skies of Greece? How changed! How pale and worn! She sat listlessly,\r\nher arms dropping on her knee; the smile that was habitual to her lips\r\nwas gone. A heavy, dull despondency, as if the life of life were no\r\nmore, seemed to weigh down her youth, and make it weary of that happy\r\nsun! In truth, her existence had languished away since it had wandered,\r\nas some melancholy stream, from the source that fed it. The sudden\r\nenthusiasm of fear or superstition that had almost, as if still in the\r\nunconscious movements of a dream, led her to fly from Zanoni, had ceased\r\nfrom the day which dawned upon her in a foreign land. Then--there--she\r\nfelt that in the smile she had evermore abandoned lived her life. She\r\ndid not repent,--she would not have recalled the impulse that winged her\r\nflight. Though the enthusiasm was gone, the superstition yet remained;\r\nshe still believed she had saved her child from that dark and guilty\r\nsorcery, concerning which the traditions of all lands are prodigal, but\r\nin none do they find such credulity, or excite such dread, as in\r\nthe South of Italy. This impression was confirmed by the mysterious\r\nconversations of Glyndon, and by her own perception of the fearful\r\nchange that had passed over one who represented himself as the victim\r\nof the enchanters. She did not, therefore, repent; but her very volition\r\nseemed gone.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at Paris, Viola saw her companion--the faithful\r\nwife--no more. Ere three weeks were passed, husband and wife had ceased\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nAnd now, for the first time, the drudgeries of this hard earth claimed\r\nthe beautiful Neapolitan. In that profession, giving voice and shape to\r\npoetry and song, in which her first years were passed, there is, while\r\nit lasts, an excitement in the art that lifts it from the labour of a\r\ncalling. Hovering between two lives, the Real and Ideal, dwells the life\r\nof music and the stage. But that life was lost evermore to the idol of\r\nthe eyes and ears of Naples. Lifted to the higher realm of passionate\r\nlove, it seemed as if the fictitious genius which represents the\r\nthoughts of others was merged in the genius that grows all thought\r\nitself. It had been the worst infidelity to the Lost, to have descended\r\nagain to live on the applause of others. And so--for she would not\r\naccept alms from Glyndon--so, by the commonest arts, the humblest\r\nindustry which the sex knows, alone and unseen, she who had slept on the\r\nbreast of Zanoni found a shelter for their child. As when, in the\r\nnoble verse prefixed to this chapter, Armida herself has destroyed her\r\nenchanted palace,--not a vestige of that bower, raised of old by Poetry\r\nand Love, remained to say, “It had been!”\r\n\r\nAnd the child avenged the father; it bloomed, it thrived,--it waxed\r\nstrong in the light of life. But still it seemed haunted and preserved\r\nby some other being than her own. In its sleep there was that slumber,\r\nso deep and rigid, which a thunderbolt could not have disturbed; and\r\nin such sleep often it moved its arms, as to embrace the air: often its\r\nlips stirred with murmured sounds of indistinct affection,--NOT FOR HER;\r\nand all the while upon its cheeks a hue of such celestial bloom, upon\r\nits lips a smile of such mysterious joy! Then, when it waked, its eyes\r\ndid not turn first to HER,--wistful, earnest, wandering, they roved\r\naround, to fix on her pale face, at last, in mute sorrow and reproach.\r\n\r\nNever had Viola felt before how mighty was her love for Zanoni; how\r\nthought, feeling, heart, soul, life,--all lay crushed and dormant in\r\nthe icy absence to which she had doomed herself! She heard not the\r\nroar without, she felt not one amidst those stormy millions,--worlds\r\nof excitement labouring through every hour. Only when Glyndon, haggard,\r\nwan, and spectre-like, glided in, day after day, to visit her, did the\r\nfair daughter of the careless South know how heavy and universal was\r\nthe Death-Air that girt her round. Sublime in her passive\r\nunconsciousness,--her mechanic life,--she sat, and feared not, in the\r\nden of the Beasts of Prey.\r\n\r\nThe door of the room opened abruptly, and Glyndon entered. His manner\r\nwas more agitated than usual.\r\n\r\n“Is it you, Clarence?” she said in her soft, languid tones. “You are\r\nbefore the hour I expected you.”\r\n\r\n“Who can count on his hours at Paris?” returned Glyndon, with a\r\nfrightful smile. “Is it not enough that I am here! Your apathy in the\r\nmidst of these sorrows appalls me. You say calmly, ‘Farewell;’ calmly\r\nyou bid me, ‘Welcome!’--as if in every corner there was not a spy, and\r\nas if with every day there was not a massacre!”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me! But in these walls lies my world. I can hardly credit all\r\nthe tales you tell me. Everything here, save THAT,” and she pointed\r\nto the infant, “seems already so lifeless, that in the tomb itself one\r\ncould scarcely less heed the crimes that are done without.”\r\n\r\nGlyndon paused for a few moments, and gazed with strange and mingled\r\nfeelings upon that face and form, still so young, and yet so invested\r\nwith that saddest of all repose,--when the heart feels old.\r\n\r\n“O Viola,” said he, at last, and in a voice of suppressed passion, “was\r\nit thus I ever thought to see you,--ever thought to feel for you, when\r\nwe two first met in the gay haunts of Naples? Ah, why then did you\r\nrefuse my love; or why was mine not worthy of you? Nay, shrink not!--let\r\nme touch your hand. No passion so sweet as that youthful love can return\r\nto me again. I feel for you but as a brother for some younger and lonely\r\nsister. With you, in your presence, sad though it be, I seem to breathe\r\nback the purer air of my early life. Here alone, except in scenes of\r\nturbulence and tempest, the Phantom ceases to pursue me. I forget even\r\nthe Death that stalks behind, and haunts me as my shadow. But better\r\ndays may be in store for us yet. Viola, I at last begin dimly to\r\nperceive how to baffle and subdue the Phantom that has cursed my\r\nlife,--it is to brave, and defy it. In sin and in riot, as I have told\r\nthee, it haunts me not. But I comprehend now what Mejnour said in his\r\ndark apothegms, ‘that I should dread the spectre most WHEN UNSEEN.’ In\r\nvirtuous and calm resolution it appears,--ay, I behold it now; there,\r\nthere, with its livid eyes!”--and the drops fell from his brow. “But\r\nit shall no longer daunt me from that resolution. I face it, and it\r\ngradually darkens back into the shade.” He paused, and his eyes dwelt\r\nwith a terrible exultation upon the sunlit space; then, with a heavy and\r\ndeep-drawn breath, he resumed, “Viola, I have found the means of escape.\r\nWe will leave this city. In some other land we will endeavour to comfort\r\neach other, and forget the past.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Viola, calmly; “I have no further wish to stir, till I am\r\nborn hence to the last resting-place. I dreamed of him last night,\r\nClarence!--dreamed of him for the first time since we parted; and,\r\ndo not mock me, methought that he forgave the deserter, and called me\r\n‘Wife.’ That dream hallows the room. Perhaps it will visit me again\r\nbefore I die.”\r\n\r\n“Talk not of him,--of the demi-fiend!” cried Glyndon, fiercely, and\r\nstamping his foot. “Thank the Heavens for any fate that hath rescued\r\nthee from him!”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Viola, gravely. And as she was about to proceed, her eye\r\nfell upon the child. It was standing in the very centre of that slanting\r\ncolumn of light which the sun poured into the chamber; and the rays\r\nseemed to surround it as a halo, and settled, crown-like, on the gold\r\nof its shining hair. In its small shape, so exquisitely modelled, in its\r\nlarge, steady, tranquil eyes, there was something that awed, while it\r\ncharmed the mother’s pride. It gazed on Glyndon as he spoke, with a\r\nlook which almost might have seemed disdain, and which Viola, at least,\r\ninterpreted as a defence of the Absent, stronger than her own lips could\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nGlyndon broke the pause.\r\n\r\n“Thou wouldst stay, for what? To betray a mother’s duty! If any evil\r\nhappen to thee here, what becomes of thine infant? Shall it be brought\r\nup an orphan, in a country that has desecrated thy religion, and where\r\nhuman charity exists no more? Ah, weep, and clasp it to thy bosom; but\r\ntears do not protect and save.”\r\n\r\n“Thou hast conquered, my friend, I will fly with thee.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow night, then, be prepared. I will bring thee the necessary\r\ndisguises.”\r\n\r\nAnd Glyndon then proceeded to sketch rapidly the outline of the path\r\nthey were to take, and the story they were to tell. Viola listened, but\r\nscarcely comprehended; he pressed her hand to his heart and departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.V.\r\n\r\n     Van seco pur anco\r\n     Sdegno ed Amor, quasi due Veltri al fianco.\r\n     “Ger. Lib.” cant. xx. cxvii.\r\n\r\n     (There went with him still Disdain and Love, like two greyhounds\r\n     side by side.)\r\n\r\nGlyndon did not perceive, as he hurried from the house, two forms\r\ncrouching by the angle of the wall. He saw still the spectre gliding by\r\nhis side; but he beheld not the yet more poisonous eyes of human envy\r\nand woman’s jealousy that glared on his retreating footsteps.\r\n\r\nNicot advanced to the house; Fillide followed him in silence. The\r\npainter, an old sans-culotte, knew well what language to assume to the\r\nporter. He beckoned the latter from his lodge, “How is this, citizen?\r\nThou harbourest a ‘suspect.’”\r\n\r\n“Citizen, you terrify me!--if so, name him.”\r\n\r\n“It is not a man; a refugee, an Italian woman, lodges here.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, au troisieme,--the door to the left. But what of her?--she cannot\r\nbe dangerous, poor child!”\r\n\r\n“Citizen, beware! Dost thou dare to pity her?”\r\n\r\n“I? No, no, indeed. But--”\r\n\r\n“Speak the truth! Who visits her?”\r\n\r\n“No one but an Englishman.”\r\n\r\n“That is it,--an Englishman, a spy of Pitt and Coburg.”\r\n\r\n“Just Heaven! is it possible?”\r\n\r\n“How, citizen! dost thou speak of Heaven? Thou must be an aristocrat!”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed; it was but an old bad habit, and escaped me unawares.”\r\n\r\n“How often does the Englishman visit her?”\r\n\r\n“Daily.”\r\n\r\nFillide uttered an exclamation.\r\n\r\n“She never stirs out,” said the porter. “Her sole occupations are in\r\nwork, and care of her infant.”\r\n\r\n“Her infant!”\r\n\r\nFillide made a bound forward. Nicot in vain endeavoured to arrest her.\r\nShe sprang up the stairs; she paused not till she was before the door\r\nindicated by the porter; it stood ajar, she entered, she stood at the\r\nthreshold, and beheld that face, still so lovely! The sight of so much\r\nbeauty left her hopeless. And the child, over whom the mother bent!--she\r\nwho had never been a mother!--she uttered no sound; the furies were at\r\nwork within her breast. Viola turned, and saw her, and, terrified by the\r\nstrange apparition, with features that expressed the deadliest hate and\r\nscorn and vengeance, uttered a cry, and snatched the child to her bosom.\r\nThe Italian laughed aloud,--turned, descended, and, gaining the spot\r\nwhere Nicot still conversed with the frightened porter drew him from the\r\nhouse. When they were in the open street, she halted abruptly, and said,\r\n“Avenge me, and name thy price!”\r\n\r\n“My price, sweet one! is but permission to love thee. Thou wilt fly with\r\nme to-morrow night; thou wilt possess thyself of the passports and the\r\nplan.”\r\n\r\n“And they--”\r\n\r\n“Shall, before then, find their asylum in the Conciergerie. The\r\nguillotine shall requite thy wrongs.”\r\n\r\n“Do this, and I am satisfied,” said Fillide, firmly.\r\n\r\nAnd they spoke no more till they regained the house. But when she there,\r\nlooking up to the dull building, saw the windows of the room which the\r\nbelief of Glyndon’s love had once made a paradise, the tiger relented at\r\nthe heart; something of the woman gushed back upon her nature, dark and\r\nsavage as it was. She pressed the arm on which she leaned convulsively,\r\nand exclaimed, “No, no! not him! denounce her,--let her perish; but I\r\nhave slept on HIS bosom,--not HIM!”\r\n\r\n“It shall be as thou wilt,” said Nicot, with a devil’s sneer; “but he\r\nmust be arrested for the moment. No harm shall happen to him, for no\r\naccuser shall appear. But her,--thou wilt not relent for her?”\r\n\r\nFillide turned upon him her eyes, and their dark glance was sufficient\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.VI.\r\n\r\n     In poppa quella\r\n     Che guidar gli dovea, fatal Donsella.\r\n     “Ger. Lib.” cant. xv. 3.\r\n\r\n     (By the prow was the fatal lady ordained to be the guide.)\r\n\r\nThe Italian did not overrate that craft of simulation proverbial with\r\nher country and her sex. Not a word, not a look, that day revealed to\r\nGlyndon the deadly change that had converted devotion into hate. He\r\nhimself, indeed, absorbed in his own schemes, and in reflections on his\r\nown strange destiny, was no nice observer. But her manner, milder\r\nand more subdued than usual, produced a softening effect upon his\r\nmeditations towards the evening; and he then began to converse with her\r\non the certain hope of escape, and on the future that would await them\r\nin less unhallowed lands.\r\n\r\n“And thy fair friend,” said Fillide, with an averted eye and a false\r\nsmile, “who was to be our companion?--thou hast resigned her, Nicot\r\ntells me, in favour of one in whom he is interested. Is it so?”\r\n\r\n“He told thee this!” returned Glyndon, evasively. “Well! does the change\r\ncontent thee?”\r\n\r\n“Traitor!” muttered Fillide; and she rose suddenly, approached him,\r\nparted the long hair from his forehead caressingly, and pressed her lips\r\nconvulsively on his brow.\r\n\r\n“This were too fair a head for the doomsman,” said she, with a slight\r\nlaugh, and, turning away, appeared occupied in preparations for their\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when he rose, Glyndon did not see the Italian; she was\r\nabsent from the house when he left it. It was necessary that he should\r\nonce more visit C-- before his final Departure, not only to arrange for\r\nNicot’s participation in the flight, but lest any suspicion should have\r\narisen to thwart or endanger the plan he had adopted. C--, though not\r\none of the immediate coterie of Robespierre, and indeed secretly hostile\r\nto him, had possessed the art of keeping well with each faction as\r\nit rose to power. Sprung from the dregs of the populace, he had,\r\nnevertheless, the grace and vivacity so often found impartially amongst\r\nevery class in France. He had contrived to enrich himself--none knew\r\nhow--in the course of his rapid career. He became, indeed, ultimately\r\none of the wealthiest proprietors of Paris, and at that time kept a\r\nsplendid and hospitable mansion. He was one of those whom, from various\r\nreasons, Robespierre deigned to favour; and he had often saved the\r\nproscribed and suspected, by procuring them passports under disguised\r\nnames, and advising their method of escape. But C-- was a man who took\r\nthis trouble only for the rich. “The incorruptible Maximilien,” who did\r\nnot want the tyrant’s faculty of penetration, probably saw through all\r\nhis manoeuvres, and the avarice which he cloaked beneath his charity.\r\nBut it was noticeable that Robespierre frequently seemed to wink\r\nat--nay, partially to encourage--such vice in men whom he meant\r\nhereafter to destroy, as would tend to lower them in the public\r\nestimation, and to contrast with his own austere and unassailable\r\nintegrity and PURISM. And, doubtless, he often grimly smiled in his\r\nsleeve at the sumptuous mansion and the griping covetousness of the\r\nworthy Citizen C--.\r\n\r\nTo this personage, then, Glyndon musingly bent his way. It was true, as\r\nhe had darkly said to Viola, that in proportion as he had resisted the\r\nspectre, its terrors had lost their influence. The time had come at\r\nlast, when, seeing crime and vice in all their hideousness, and in so\r\nvast a theatre, he had found that in vice and crime there are deadlier\r\nhorrors than in the eyes of a phantom-fear. His native nobleness began\r\nto return to him. As he passed the streets, he revolved in his mind\r\nprojects of future repentance and reformation. He even meditated, as a\r\njust return for Fillide’s devotion, the sacrifice of all the reasonings\r\nof his birth and education. He would repair whatever errors he had\r\ncommitted against her, by the self-immolation of marriage with one\r\nlittle congenial with himself. He who had once revolted from marriage\r\nwith the noble and gentle Viola!--he had learned in that world of wrong\r\nto know that right is right, and that Heaven did not make the one sex to\r\nbe the victim of the other. The young visions of the Beautiful and the\r\nGood rose once more before him; and along the dark ocean of his mind lay\r\nthe smile of reawakening virtue, as a path of moonlight. Never, perhaps,\r\nhad the condition of his soul been so elevated and unselfish.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Jean Nicot, equally absorbed in dreams of the future,\r\nand already in his own mind laying out to the best advantage the gold of\r\nthe friend he was about to betray, took his way to the house honoured\r\nby the residence of Robespierre. He had no intention to comply with the\r\nrelenting prayer of Fillide, that the life of Glyndon should be spared.\r\nHe thought with Barrere, “Il n’y a que les morts qui ne revient pas.”\r\n In all men who have devoted themselves to any study, or any art, with\r\nsufficient pains to attain a certain degree of excellence, there must be\r\na fund of energy immeasurably above that of the ordinary herd. Usually\r\nthis energy is concentrated on the objects of their professional\r\nambition, and leaves them, therefore, apathetic to the other pursuits\r\nof men. But where those objects are denied, where the stream has not its\r\nlegitimate vent, the energy, irritated and aroused, possesses the whole\r\nbeing, and if not wasted on desultory schemes, or if not purified by\r\nconscience and principle, becomes a dangerous and destructive element in\r\nthe social system, through which it wanders in riot and disorder. Hence,\r\nin all wise monarchies,--nay, in all well-constituted states,--the\r\npeculiar care with which channels are opened for every art and every\r\nscience; hence the honour paid to their cultivators by subtle and\r\nthoughtful statesmen, who, perhaps, for themselves, see nothing in a\r\npicture but coloured canvas,--nothing in a problem but an ingenious\r\npuzzle. No state is ever more in danger than when the talent that should\r\nbe consecrated to peace has no occupation but political intrigue or\r\npersonal advancement. Talent unhonoured is talent at war with men. And\r\nhere it is noticeable, that the class of actors having been the most\r\ndegraded by the public opinion of the old regime, their very dust\r\ndeprived of Christian burial, no men (with certain exceptions in the\r\ncompany especially favoured by the Court) were more relentless and\r\nrevengeful among the scourges of the Revolution. In the savage Collot\r\nd’Herbois, mauvais comedien, were embodied the wrongs and the vengeance\r\nof a class.\r\n\r\nNow the energy of Jean Nicot had never been sufficiently directed to\r\nthe art he professed. Even in his earliest youth, the political\r\ndisquisitions of his master, David, had distracted him from the more\r\ntedious labours of the easel. The defects of his person had embittered\r\nhis mind; the atheism of his benefactor had deadened his conscience.\r\nFor one great excellence of religion--above all, the Religion of the\r\nCross--is, that it raises PATIENCE first into a virtue, and next into a\r\nhope. Take away the doctrine of another life, of requital hereafter, of\r\nthe smile of a Father upon our sufferings and trials in our ordeal here,\r\nand what becomes of patience? But without patience, what is man?--and\r\nwhat a people? Without patience, art never can be high; without\r\npatience, liberty never can be perfected. By wild throes, and impetuous,\r\naimless struggles, Intellect seeks to soar from Penury, and a nation\r\nto struggle into Freedom. And woe, thus unfortified, guideless, and\r\nunenduring,--woe to both!\r\n\r\nNicot was a villain as a boy. In most criminals, however abandoned,\r\nthere are touches of humanity,--relics of virtue; and the true\r\ndelineator of mankind often incurs the taunt of bad hearts and dull\r\nminds, for showing that even the worst alloy has some particles of gold,\r\nand even the best that come stamped from the mint of Nature have some\r\nadulteration of the dross. But there are exceptions, though few, to the\r\ngeneral rule,--exceptions, when the conscience lies utterly dead, and\r\nwhen good or bad are things indifferent but as means to some selfish\r\nend. So was it with the protege of the atheist. Envy and hate filled up\r\nhis whole being, and the consciousness of superior talent only made him\r\ncurse the more all who passed him in the sunlight with a fairer form or\r\nhappier fortunes. But, monster though he was, when his murderous fingers\r\ngriped the throat of his benefactor, Time, and that ferment of all evil\r\npassions--the Reign of Blood--had made in the deep hell of his heart a\r\ndeeper still. Unable to exercise his calling (for even had he dared to\r\nmake his name prominent, revolutions are no season for painters; and no\r\nman--no! not the richest and proudest magnate of the land, has so great\r\nan interest in peace and order, has so high and essential a stake in the\r\nwell being of society, as the poet and the artist), his whole intellect,\r\never restless and unguided, was left to ponder over the images of guilt\r\nmost congenial to it. He had no future but in this life; and how in this\r\nlife had the men of power around him, the great wrestlers for dominion,\r\nthriven? All that was good, pure, unselfish,--whether among Royalists or\r\nRepublicans,--swept to the shambles, and the deathsmen left alone in the\r\npomp and purple of their victims! Nobler paupers than Jean Nicot would\r\ndespair; and Poverty would rise in its ghastly multitudes to cut the\r\nthroat of Wealth, and then gash itself limb by limb, if Patience, the\r\nAngel of the Poor, sat not by its side, pointing with solemn finger to\r\nthe life to come! And now, as Nicot neared the house of the Dictator, he\r\nbegan to meditate a reversal of his plans of the previous day: not\r\nthat he faltered in his resolution to denounce Glyndon, and Viola would\r\nnecessarily share his fate, as a companion and accomplice,--no, THERE\r\nhe was resolved! for he hated both (to say nothing of his old but\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten grudge against Zanoni). Viola had scorned him,\r\nGlyndon had served, and the thought of gratitude was as intolerable\r\nto him as the memory of insult. But why, now, should he fly from\r\nFrance?--he could possess himself of Glyndon’s gold; he doubted not\r\nthat he could so master Fillide by her wrath and jealousy that he\r\ncould command her acquiescence in all he proposed. The papers he had\r\npurloined--Desmoulins’ correspondence with Glyndon--while it insured the\r\nfate of the latter, might be eminently serviceable to Robespierre, might\r\ninduce the tyrant to forget his own old liaisons with Hebert, and\r\nenlist him among the allies and tools of the King of Terror. Hopes\r\nof advancement, of wealth, of a career, again rose before him. This\r\ncorrespondence, dated shortly before Camille Desmoulins’ death, was\r\nwritten with that careless and daring imprudence which characterised the\r\nspoiled child of Danton. It spoke openly of designs against Robespierre;\r\nit named confederates whom the tyrant desired only a popular pretext\r\nto crush. It was a new instrument of death in the hands of the\r\nDeath-compeller. What greater gift could he bestow on Maximilien the\r\nIncorruptible?\r\n\r\nNursing these thoughts, he arrived at last before the door of Citizen\r\nDupleix. Around the threshold were grouped, in admired confusion,\r\nsome eight or ten sturdy Jacobins, the voluntary body-guard of\r\nRobespierre,--tall fellows, well armed, and insolent with the power that\r\nreflects power, mingled with women, young and fair, and gayly dressed,\r\nwho had come, upon the rumour that Maximilien had had an attack of bile,\r\nto inquire tenderly of his health; for Robespierre, strange though it\r\nseem, was the idol of the sex!\r\n\r\nThrough this cortege stationed without the door, and reaching up the\r\nstairs to the landing-place,--for Robespierre’s apartments were not\r\nspacious enough to afford sufficient antechamber for levees so numerous\r\nand miscellaneous,--Nicot forced his way; and far from friendly or\r\nflattering were the expressions that regaled his ears.\r\n\r\n“Aha, le joli Polichinelle!” said a comely matron, whose robe his\r\nobtrusive and angular elbows cruelly discomposed. “But how could one\r\nexpect gallantry from such a scarecrow!”\r\n\r\n“Citizen, I beg to advise thee (The courteous use of the plural was\r\nproscribed at Paris. The Societies Populaires had decided that whoever\r\nused it should be prosecuted as suspect et adulateur! At the door of\r\nthe public administrations and popular societies was written up, “Ici on\r\ns’honore du Citoyen, et on se tutoye”!!! (“Here they respect the title\r\nof Citizen, and they ‘thee’ and ‘thou’ one another.”) Take away Murder\r\nfrom the French Revolution and it becomes the greatest farce ever played\r\nbefore the angels!) that thou art treading on my feet. I beg thy pardon,\r\nbut now I look at thine, I see the hall is not wide enough for them.”\r\n\r\n“Ho! Citizen Nicot,” cried a Jacobin, shouldering his formidable\r\nbludgeon, “and what brings thee hither?--thinkest thou that Hebert’s\r\ncrimes are forgotten already? Off, sport of Nature! and thank the Etre\r\nSupreme that he made thee insignificant enough to be forgiven.”\r\n\r\n“A pretty face to look out of the National Window” (The Guillotine.),\r\nsaid the woman whose robe the painter had ruffled.\r\n\r\n“Citizens,” said Nicot, white with passion, but constraining himself so\r\nthat his words seemed to come from grinded teeth, “I have the honour\r\nto inform you that I seek the Representant upon business of the\r\nutmost importance to the public and himself; and,” he added slowly and\r\nmalignantly, glaring round, “I call all good citizens to be my witnesses\r\nwhen I shall complain to Robespierre of the reception bestowed on me by\r\nsome amongst you.”\r\n\r\nThere was in the man’s look and his tone of voice so much of deep\r\nand concentrated malignity, that the idlers drew back, and as the\r\nremembrance of the sudden ups and downs of revolutionary life occurred\r\nto them, several voices were lifted to assure the squalid and ragged\r\npainter that nothing was farther from their thoughts than to offer\r\naffront to a citizen whose very appearance proved him to be an exemplary\r\nsans-culotte. Nicot received these apologies in sullen silence, and,\r\nfolding his arms, leaned against the wall, waiting in grim patience for\r\nhis admission.\r\n\r\nThe loiterers talked to each other in separate knots of two and three;\r\nand through the general hum rang the clear, loud, careless whistle of\r\nthe tall Jacobin who stood guard by the stairs. Next to Nicot, an old\r\nwoman and a young virgin were muttering in earnest whispers, and the\r\natheist painter chuckled inly to overhear their discourse.\r\n\r\n“I assure thee, my dear,” said the crone, with a mysterious shake of\r\nhead, “that the divine Catherine Theot, whom the impious now persecute,\r\nis really inspired. There can be no doubt that the elect, of whom Dom\r\nGerle and the virtuous Robespierre are destined to be the two grand\r\nprophets, will enjoy eternal life here, and exterminate all their\r\nenemies. There is no doubt of it,--not the least!”\r\n\r\n“How delightful!” said the girl; “ce cher Robespierre!--he does not look\r\nvery long-lived either!”\r\n\r\n“The greater the miracle,” said the old woman. “I am just eighty-one,\r\nand I don’t feel a day older since Catherine Theot promised me I should\r\nbe one of the elect!”\r\n\r\nHere the women were jostled aside by some newcomers, who talked loud and\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried a brawny man, whose garb denoted him to be a butcher,\r\nwith bare arms, and a cap of liberty on his head; “I am come to warn\r\nRobespierre. They lay a snare for him; they offer him the Palais\r\nNational. ‘On ne peut etre ami du peuple et habiter un palais.’” (“No\r\none can be a friend of the people, and dwell in a palace.”--“Papiers\r\ninedits trouves chez Robespierre,” etc., volume ii. page 132.)\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” answered a cordonnier; “I like him best in his little\r\nlodging with the menuisier: it looks like one of US.”\r\n\r\nAnother rush of the crowd, and a new group were thrown forward in the\r\nvicinity of Nicot. And these men gabbled and chattered faster and louder\r\nthan the rest.\r\n\r\n“But my plan is--”\r\n\r\n“Au diable with YOUR plan! I tell you MY scheme is--”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” cried a third. “When Robespierre understands MY new method\r\nof making gunpowder, the enemies of France shall--”\r\n\r\n“Bah! who fears foreign enemies?” interrupted a fourth; “the enemies\r\nto be feared are at home. MY new guillotine takes off fifty heads at a\r\ntime!”\r\n\r\n“But MY new Constitution!” exclaimed a fifth.\r\n\r\n“MY new Religion, citizen!” murmured, complacently, a sixth.\r\n\r\n“Sacre mille tonnerres, silence!” roared forth one of the Jacobin guard.\r\n\r\nAnd the crowd suddenly parted as a fierce-looking man, buttoned up to\r\nthe chin, his sword rattling by his side, his spurs clinking at\r\nhis heel, descended the stairs,--his cheeks swollen and purple with\r\nintemperance, his eyes dead and savage as a vulture’s. There was a still\r\npause, as all, with pale cheeks, made way for the relentless Henriot.\r\n(Or H_a_nriot. It is singular how undetermined are not only the\r\ncharacters of the French Revolution, but even the spelling of their\r\nnames. With the historians it is Vergniau_d_,--with the journalists of\r\nthe time it is Vorgniau_x_. With one authority it is Robespierre,--with\r\nanother Robe_r_spierre.) Scarce had this gruff and iron minion of the\r\ntyrant stalked through the throng, than a new movement of respect and\r\nagitation and fear swayed the increasing crowd, as there glided in, with\r\nthe noiselessness of a shadow, a smiling, sober citizen, plainly but\r\nneatly clad, with a downcast humble eye. A milder, meeker face no\r\npastoral poet could assign to Corydon or Thyrsis,--why did the crowd\r\nshrink and hold their breath? As the ferret in a burrow crept that\r\nslight form amongst the larger and rougher creatures that huddled and\r\npressed back on each other as he passed. A wink of his stealthy eye, and\r\nthe huge Jacobins left the passage clear, without sound or question. On\r\nhe went to the apartment of the tyrant, and thither will we follow him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.VII.\r\n\r\n     Constitutum est, ut quisquis eum HOMINEM dixisset fuisse,\r\n     capitalem penderet poenam.\r\n     --St. Augustine, “Of the God Serapis,” l. 18, “de Civ. Dei,” c. 5.\r\n\r\n     (It was decreed, that whoso should say that he had been a MAN,\r\n     should suffer the punishment of a capital offence.)\r\n\r\nRobespierre was reclining languidly in his fauteuil, his cadaverous\r\ncountenance more jaded and fatigued than usual. He to whom Catherine\r\nTheot assured immortal life, looked, indeed, like a man at death’s door.\r\nOn the table before him was a dish heaped with oranges, with the juice\r\nof which it is said that he could alone assuage the acrid bile that\r\noverflowed his system; and an old woman, richly dressed (she had been a\r\nMarquise in the old regime) was employed in peeling the Hesperian fruits\r\nfor the sick Dragon, with delicate fingers covered with jewels. I\r\nhave before said that Robespierre was the idol of the women. Strange\r\ncertainly!--but then they were French women! The old Marquise, who, like\r\nCatherine Theot, called him “son,” really seemed to love him piously and\r\ndisinterestedly as a mother; and as she peeled the oranges, and heaped\r\non him the most caressing and soothing expressions, the livid ghost of a\r\nsmile fluttered about his meagre lips. At a distance, Payan and Couthon,\r\nseated at another table, were writing rapidly, and occasionally pausing\r\nfrom their work to consult with each other in brief whispers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of the Jacobins opened the door, and, approaching\r\nRobespierre, whispered to him the name of Guerin. (See for the espionage\r\non which Guerin was employed, “Les Papiers inedits,” etc., volume i.\r\npage 366, No. xxviii.) At that word the sick man started up, as if new\r\nlife were in the sound.\r\n\r\n“My kind friend,” he said to the Marquise, “forgive me; I must dispense\r\nwith thy tender cares. France demands me. I am never ill when I can\r\nserve my country!”\r\n\r\nThe old Marquise lifted up her eyes to heaven and murmured, “Quel ange!”\r\n\r\nRobespierre waved his hand impatiently; and the old woman, with a sigh,\r\npatted his pale cheek, kissed his forehead, and submissively withdrew.\r\nThe next moment, the smiling, sober man we have before described, stood,\r\nbending low, before the tyrant. And well might Robespierre welcome one\r\nof the subtlest agents of his power,--one on whom he relied more than\r\nthe clubs of his Jacobins, the tongues of his orators, the bayonets of\r\nhis armies; Guerin, the most renowned of his ecouteurs,--the searching,\r\nprying, universal, omnipresent spy, who glided like a sunbeam through\r\nchink and crevice, and brought to him intelligence not only of the\r\ndeeds, but the hearts of men!\r\n\r\n“Well, citizen, well!--and what of Tallien?”\r\n\r\n“This morning, early, two minutes after eight, he went out.”\r\n\r\n“So early?--hem!”\r\n\r\n“He passed Rue des Quatre Fils, Rue de Temple, Rue de la Reunion, au\r\nMarais, Rue Martin; nothing observable, except that--”\r\n\r\n“That what?”\r\n\r\n“He amused himself at a stall in bargaining for some books.”\r\n\r\n“Bargaining for books! Aha, the charlatan!--he would cloak the\r\nintriguant under the savant! Well!”\r\n\r\n“At last, in the Rue des Fosses Montmartre, an individual in a blue\r\nsurtout (unknown) accosted him. They walked together about the street\r\nsome minutes, and were joined by Legendre.”\r\n\r\n“Legendre! approach, Payan! Legendre, thou hearest!”\r\n\r\n“I went into a fruit-stall, and hired two little girls to go and play\r\nat ball within hearing. They heard Legendre say, ‘I believe his power is\r\nwearing itself out.’ And Tallien answered, ‘And HIMSELF too. I would not\r\ngive three months’ purchase for his life.’ I do not know, citizen, if\r\nthey meant THEE?”\r\n\r\n“Nor I, citizen,” answered Robespierre, with a fell smile, succeeded by\r\nan expression of gloomy thought. “Ha!” he muttered; “I am young yet,--in\r\nthe prime of life. I commit no excess. No; my constitution is sound,\r\nsound. Anything farther of Tallien?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The woman whom he loves--Teresa de Fontenai--who lies in prison,\r\nstill continues to correspond with him; to urge him to save her by thy\r\ndestruction: this my listeners overheard. His servant is the messenger\r\nbetween the prisoner and himself.”\r\n\r\n“So! The servant shall be seized in the open streets of Paris. The Reign\r\nof Terror is not over yet. With the letters found on him, if such their\r\ncontext, I will pluck Tallien from his benches in the Convention.”\r\n\r\nRobespierre rose, and after walking a few moments to and fro the room\r\nin thought, opened the door and summoned one of the Jacobins without.\r\nTo him he gave his orders for the watch and arrest of Tallien’s servant,\r\nand then threw himself again into his chair. As the Jacobin departed,\r\nGuerin whispered,--\r\n\r\n“Is not that the Citizen Aristides?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; a faithful fellow, if he would wash himself, and not swear so\r\nmuch.”\r\n\r\n“Didst thou not guillotine his brother?”\r\n\r\n“But Aristides denounced him.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, are such men safe about thy person?”\r\n\r\n“Humph! that is true.” And Robespierre, drawing out his pocketbook,\r\nwrote a memorandum in it, replaced it in his vest, and resumed,--\r\n\r\n“What else of Tallien?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing more. He and Legendre, with the unknown, walked to the Jardin\r\nEgalite, and there parted. I saw Tallien to his house. But I have\r\nother news. Thou badest me watch for those who threaten thee in secret\r\nletters.”\r\n\r\n“Guerin! hast thou detected them? Hast thou--hast thou--”\r\n\r\nAnd the tyrant, as he spoke, opened and shut both his hands, as if\r\nalready grasping the lives of the writers, and one of those convulsive\r\ngrimaces that seemed like an epileptic affection, to which he was\r\nsubject, distorted his features.\r\n\r\n“Citizen, I think I have found one. Thou must know that amongst those\r\nmost disaffected is the painter Nicot.”\r\n\r\n“Stay, stay!” said Robespierre, opening a manuscript book, bound in red\r\nmorocco (for Robespierre was neat and precise, even in his death-lists),\r\nand turning to an alphabetical index,--“Nicot!--I have him,--atheist,\r\nsans-culotte (I hate slovens), friend of Hebert! Aha! N.B.--Rene Dumas\r\nknows of his early career and crimes. Proceed!”\r\n\r\n“This Nicot has been suspected of diffusing tracts and pamphlets against\r\nthyself and the Comite. Yesterday evening, when he was out, his porter\r\nadmitted me into his apartment, Rue Beau Repaire. With my master-key I\r\nopened his desk and escritoire. I found herein a drawing of thyself at\r\nthe guillotine; and underneath was written, ‘Bourreau de ton pays, lis\r\nl’arret de ton chatiment!’ (Executioner of thy country, read the decree\r\nof thy punishment!) I compared the words with the fragments of the\r\nvarious letters thou gavest me: the handwriting tallies with one. See, I\r\ntore off the writing.”\r\n\r\nRobespierre looked, smiled, and, as if his vengeance were already\r\nsatisfied, threw himself on his chair. “It is well! I feared it was a\r\nmore powerful enemy. This man must be arrested at once.”\r\n\r\n“And he waits below. I brushed by him as I ascended the stairs.”\r\n\r\n“Does he so?--admit!--nay,--hold! hold! Guerin, withdraw into the\r\ninner chamber till I summon thee again. Dear Payan, see that this Nicot\r\nconceals no weapons.”\r\n\r\nPayan, who was as brave as Robespierre was pusillanimous, repressed the\r\nsmile of disdain that quivered on his lips a moment, and left the room.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Robespierre, with his head buried in his bosom, seemed\r\nplunged in deep thought. “Life is a melancholy thing, Couthon!” said he,\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n“Begging your pardon, I think death worse,” answered the philanthropist,\r\ngently.\r\n\r\nRobespierre made no rejoinder, but took from his portefeuille that\r\nsingular letter, which was found afterwards amongst his papers, and\r\nis marked LXI. in the published collection. (“Papiers inedits,’ etc.,\r\nvolume ii. page 156.)\r\n\r\n“Without doubt,” it began, “you are uneasy at not having earlier\r\nreceived news from me. Be not alarmed; you know that I ought only to\r\nreply by our ordinary courier; and as he has been interrupted, dans sa\r\nderniere course, that is the cause of my delay. When you receive this,\r\nemploy all diligence to fly a theatre where you are about to appear\r\nand disappear for the last time. It were idle to recall to you all the\r\nreasons that expose you to peril. The last step that should place you\r\nsur le sopha de la presidence, but brings you to the scaffold; and the\r\nmob will spit on your face as it has spat on those whom you have\r\njudged. Since, then, you have accumulated here a sufficient treasure for\r\nexistence, I await you with great impatience, to laugh with you at the\r\npart you have played in the troubles of a nation as credulous as it is\r\navid of novelties. Take your part according to our arrangements,--all is\r\nprepared. I conclude,--our courier waits. I expect your reply.”\r\n\r\nMusingly and slowly the Dictator devoured the contents of this epistle.\r\n“No,” he said to himself,--“no; he who has tasted power can no longer\r\nenjoy repose. Yet, Danton, Danton! thou wert right; better to be a poor\r\nfisherman than to govern men.” (“Il vaudrait mieux,” said Danton, in his\r\ndungeon, “etre un pauvre pecheur que de gouverner les hommes.”)\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Payan reappeared and whispered Robespierre, “All is\r\nsafe! See the man.”\r\n\r\nThe Dictator, satisfied, summoned his attendant Jacobin to conduct Nicot\r\nto his presence. The painter entered with a fearless expression in his\r\ndeformed features, and stood erect before Robespierre, who scanned him\r\nwith a sidelong eye.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that most of the principal actors of the Revolution\r\nwere singularly hideous in appearance,--from the colossal ugliness of\r\nMirabeau and Danton, or the villanous ferocity in the countenances\r\nof David and Simon, to the filthy squalor of Marat, the sinister and\r\nbilious meanness of the Dictator’s features. But Robespierre, who was\r\nsaid to resemble a cat, had also a cat’s cleanness; and his prim and\r\ndainty dress, his shaven smoothness, the womanly whiteness of his\r\nlean hands, made yet more remarkable the disorderly ruffianism that\r\ncharacterised the attire and mien of the painter-sans-culotte.\r\n\r\n“And so, citizen,” said Robespierre, mildly, “thou wouldst speak with\r\nme? I know thy merits and civism have been overlooked too long. Thou\r\nwouldst ask some suitable provision in the state? Scruple not--say on!”\r\n\r\n“Virtuous Robespierre, toi qui eclaires l’univers (Thou who enlightenest\r\nthe world.), I come not to ask a favour, but to render service to the\r\nstate. I have discovered a correspondence that lays open a conspiracy of\r\nwhich many of the actors are yet unsuspected.” And he placed the papers\r\non the table. Robespierre seized, and ran his eye over them rapidly and\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“Good!--good!” he muttered to himself: “this is all I wanted. Barrere,\r\nLegendre! I have them! Camille Desmoulins was but their dupe. I loved\r\nhim once; I never loved them! Citizen Nicot, I thank thee. I observe\r\nthese letters are addressed to an Englishman. What Frenchman but must\r\ndistrust these English wolves in sheep’s clothing! France wants no\r\nlonger citizens of the world; that farce ended with Anarcharsis Clootz.\r\nI beg pardon, Citizen Nicot; but Clootz and Hebert were THY friends.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Nicot, apologetically, “we are all liable to be deceived. I\r\nceased to honour them whom thou didst declare against; for I disown my\r\nown senses rather than thy justice.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I pretend to justice; that IS the virtue I affect,” said\r\nRobespierre, meekly; and with his feline propensities he enjoyed, even\r\nin that critical hour of vast schemes, of imminent danger, of meditated\r\nrevenge, the pleasure of playing with a solitary victim. (The most\r\ndetestable anecdote of this peculiar hypocrisy in Robespierre is that\r\nin which he is recorded to have tenderly pressed the hand of his old\r\nschool-friend, Camille Desmoulins, the day that he signed the warrant\r\nfor his arrest.) “And my justice shall no longer be blind to thy\r\nservices, good Nicot. Thou knowest this Glyndon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, well,--intimately. He WAS my friend, but I would give up my\r\nbrother if he were one of the ‘indulgents.’ I am not ashamed to say that\r\nI have received favours from this man.”\r\n\r\n“Aha!--and thou dost honestly hold the doctrine that where a man\r\nthreatens my life all personal favours are to be forgotten?”\r\n\r\n“All!”\r\n\r\n“Good citizen!--kind Nicot!--oblige me by writing the address of this\r\nGlyndon.”\r\n\r\nNicot stooped to the table; and suddenly when the pen was in his hand, a\r\nthought flashed across him, and he paused, embarrassed and confused.\r\n\r\n“Write on, KIND Nicot!”\r\n\r\nThe painter slowly obeyed.\r\n\r\n“Who are the other familiars of Glyndon?”\r\n\r\n“It was on that point I was about to speak to thee, Representant,” said\r\nNicot. “He visits daily a woman, a foreigner, who knows all his secrets;\r\nshe affects to be poor, and to support her child by industry. But she is\r\nthe wife of an Italian of immense wealth, and there is no doubt that\r\nshe has moneys which are spent in corrupting the citizens. She should be\r\nseized and arrested.”\r\n\r\n“Write down her name also.”\r\n\r\n“But no time is to be lost; for I know that both have a design to escape\r\nfrom Paris this very night.”\r\n\r\n“Our government is prompt, good Nicot,--never fear. Humph!--humph!” and\r\nRobespierre took the paper on which Nicot had written, and stooping over\r\nit--for he was near-sighted--added, smilingly, “Dost thou always write\r\nthe same hand, citizen? This seems almost like a disguised character.”\r\n\r\n“I should not like them to know who denounced them, Representant.”\r\n\r\n“Good! good! Thy virtue shall be rewarded, trust me. Salut et\r\nfraternite!”\r\n\r\nRobespierre half rose as he spoke, and Nicot withdrew.\r\n\r\n“Ho, there!--without!” cried the Dictator, ringing his bell; and as the\r\nready Jacobin attended the summons, “Follow that man, Jean Nicot. The\r\ninstant he has cleared the house seize him. At once to the Conciergerie\r\nwith him. Stay!--nothing against the law; there is thy warrant. The\r\npublic accuser shall have my instruction. Away!--quick!”\r\n\r\nThe Jacobin vanished. All trace of illness, of infirmity, had gone from\r\nthe valetudinarian; he stood erect on the floor, his face\r\ntwitching convulsively, and his arms folded. “Ho! Guerin!” the spy\r\nreappeared--“take these addresses! Within an hour this Englishman and\r\nhis woman must be in prison; their revelations will aid me against\r\nworthier foes. They shall die: they shall perish with the rest on the\r\n10th,--the third day from this. There!” and he wrote hastily,--“there,\r\nalso, is thy warrant! Off!\r\n\r\n“And now, Couthon, Payan, we will dally no longer with Tallien and his\r\ncrew. I have information that the Convention will NOT attend the Fete on\r\nthe 10th. We must trust only to the sword of the law. I must compose\r\nmy thoughts,--prepare my harangue. To-morrow, I will reappear at the\r\nConvention; to-morrow, bold St. Just joins us, fresh from our victorious\r\narmies; to-morrow, from the tribune, I will dart the thunderbolt on the\r\nmasked enemies of France; to-morrow, I will demand, in the face of the\r\ncountry, the heads of the conspirators.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.VIII.\r\n\r\n     Le glaive est contre toi tourne de toutes parties.\r\n     La Harpe, “Jeanne de Naples,” Act iv. sc. 4.\r\n\r\n     (The sword is raised against you on all sides.)\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Glyndon, after an audience of some length with C--,\r\nin which the final preparations were arranged, sanguine of safety,\r\nand foreseeing no obstacle to escape, bent his way back to Fillide.\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of his cheerful thoughts, he fancied he heard a\r\nvoice too well and too terribly recognised, hissing in his ear, “What!\r\nthou wouldst defy and escape me! thou wouldst go back to virtue and\r\ncontent. It is in vain,--it is too late. No, _I_ will not haunt thee;\r\nHUMAN footsteps, no less inexorable, dog thee now. Me thou shalt not see\r\nagain till in the dungeon, at midnight, before thy doom! Behold--”\r\n\r\nAnd Glyndon, mechanically turning his head, saw, close behind him, the\r\nstealthy figure of a man whom he had observed before, but with little\r\nheed, pass and repass him, as he quitted the house of Citizen C--.\r\nInstantly and instinctively he knew that he was watched,--that he was\r\npursued. The street he was in was obscure and deserted, for the day was\r\noppressively sultry, and it was the hour when few were abroad, either\r\non business or pleasure. Bold as he was, an icy chill shot through his\r\nheart, he knew too well the tremendous system that then reigned in Paris\r\nnot to be aware of his danger. As the sight of the first plague-boil to\r\nthe victim of the pestilence, was the first sight of the shadowy spy\r\nto that of the Revolution: the watch, the arrest, the trial, the\r\nguillotine,--these made the regular and rapid steps of the monster that\r\nthe anarchists called Law! He breathed hard, he heard distinctly the\r\nloud beating of his heart. And so he paused, still and motionless,\r\ngazing upon the shadow that halted also behind him.\r\n\r\nPresently, the absence of all allies to the spy, the solitude of the\r\nstreets, reanimated his courage; he made a step towards his pursuer, who\r\nretreated as he advanced. “Citizen, thou followest me,” he said. “Thy\r\nbusiness?”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” answered the man, with a deprecating smile, “the streets are\r\nbroad enough for both? Thou art not so bad a republican as to arrogate\r\nall Paris to thyself!”\r\n\r\n“Go on first, then. I make way for thee.”\r\n\r\nThe man bowed, doffed his hat politely, and passed forward. The next\r\nmoment Glyndon plunged into a winding lane, and fled fast through a\r\nlabyrinth of streets, passages, and alleys. By degrees he composed\r\nhimself, and, looking behind, imagined that he had baffled the pursuer;\r\nhe then, by a circuitous route, bent his way once more to his home. As\r\nhe emerged into one of the broader streets, a passenger, wrapped in\r\na mantle, brushing so quickly by him that he did not observe his\r\ncountenance, whispered, “Clarence Glyndon, you are dogged,--follow\r\nme!” and the stranger walked quickly before him. Clarence turned, and\r\nsickened once more to see at his heels, with the same servile smile\r\non his face, the pursuer he fancied he had escaped. He forgot the\r\ninjunction of the stranger to follow him, and perceiving a crowd\r\ngathered close at hand, round a caricature-shop, dived amidst them, and,\r\ngaining another street, altered the direction he had before taken, and,\r\nafter a long and breathless course, gained without once more seeing the\r\nspy, a distant quartier of the city.\r\n\r\nHere, indeed, all seemed so serene and fair that his artist eye, even\r\nin that imminent hour, rested with pleasure on the scene. It was a\r\ncomparatively broad space, formed by one of the noble quays. The Seine\r\nflowed majestically along, with boats and craft resting on its surface.\r\nThe sun gilt a thousand spires and domes, and gleamed on the white\r\npalaces of a fallen chivalry. Here fatigued and panting, he paused an\r\ninstant, and a cooler air from the river fanned his brow. “Awhile, at\r\nleast, I am safe here,” he murmured; and as he spoke, some thirty paces\r\nbehind him, he beheld the spy. He stood rooted to the spot; wearied and\r\nspent as he was, escape seemed no longer possible,--the river on one\r\nside (no bridge at hand), and the long row of mansions closing up the\r\nother. As he halted, he heard laughter and obscene songs from a house a\r\nlittle in his rear, between himself and the spy. It was a cafe fearfully\r\nknown in that quarter. Hither often resorted the black troop of\r\nHenriot,--the minions and huissiers of Robespierre. The spy, then,\r\nhad hunted the victim within the jaws of the hounds. The man slowly\r\nadvanced, and, pausing before the open window of the cafe, put his head\r\nthrough the aperture, as to address and summon forth its armed inmates.\r\n\r\nAt that very instant, and while the spy’s head was thus turned from him,\r\nstanding in the half-open gateway of the house immediately before\r\nhim, he perceived the stranger who had warned; the figure, scarcely\r\ndistinguishable through the mantle that wrapped it, motioned to him\r\nto enter. He sprang noiselessly through the friendly opening: the door\r\nclosed; breathlessly he followed the stranger up a flight of broad\r\nstairs and through a suite of empty rooms, until, having gained a small\r\ncabinet, his conductor doffed the large hat and the long mantle that had\r\nhitherto concealed his shape and features, and Glyndon beheld Zanoni!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.IX.\r\n\r\n     Think not my magic wonders wrought by aid\r\n     Of Stygian angels summoned up from hell;\r\n     Scorned and accursed be those who have essayed\r\n     Her gloomy Dives and Afrites to compel.\r\n     But by perception of the secret powers\r\n     Of mineral springs in Nature’s inmost cell,\r\n     Of herbs in curtain of her greenest bowers,\r\n     And of the moving stars o’er mountain tops and towers.\r\n     Wiffen’s “Translation of Tasso,” cant. xiv. xliii.\r\n\r\n“You are safe here, young Englishman!” said Zanoni, motioning Glyndon to\r\na seat. “Fortunate for you that I come on your track at last!”\r\n\r\n“Far happier had it been if we had never met! Yet even in these last\r\nhours of my fate, I rejoice to look once more on the face of that\r\nominous and mysterious being to whom I can ascribe all the sufferings\r\nI have known. Here, then, thou shalt not palter with or elude me. Here,\r\nbefore we part, thou shalt unravel to me the dark enigma, if not of thy\r\nlife, of my own!”\r\n\r\n“Hast thou suffered? Poor neophyte!” said Zanoni, pityingly. “Yes; I see\r\nit on thy brow. But wherefore wouldst thou blame me? Did I not warn thee\r\nagainst the whispers of thy spirit; did I not warn thee to forbear? Did\r\nI not tell thee that the ordeal was one of awful hazard and tremendous\r\nfears,--nay, did I not offer to resign to thee the heart that was mighty\r\nenough, while mine, Glyndon, to content me? Was it not thine own daring\r\nand resolute choice to brave the initiation! Of thine own free will\r\ndidst thou make Mejnour thy master, and his lore thy study!”\r\n\r\n“But whence came the irresistible desires of that wild and unholy\r\nknowledge? I knew them not till thine evil eye fell upon me, and I was\r\ndrawn into the magic atmosphere of thy being!”\r\n\r\n“Thou errest!--the desires were in thee; and, whether in one direction\r\nor the other, would have forced their way! Man! thou askest me the\r\nenigma of thy fate and my own! Look round all being, is there not\r\nmystery everywhere? Can thine eye trace the ripening of the grain\r\nbeneath the earth? In the moral and the physical world alike, lie dark\r\nportents, far more wondrous than the powers thou wouldst ascribe to me!”\r\n\r\n“Dost thou disown those powers; dost thou confess thyself an\r\nimposter?--or wilt thou dare to tell me that thou art indeed sold to the\r\nEvil one,--a magician whose familiar has haunted me night and day?”\r\n\r\n“It matters not what I am,” returned Zanoni; “it matters only whether I\r\ncan aid thee to exorcise thy dismal phantom, and return once more to the\r\nwholesome air of this common life. Something, however, will I tell thee,\r\nnot to vindicate myself, but the Heaven and the Nature that thy doubts\r\nmalign.”\r\n\r\nZanoni paused a moment, and resumed with a slight smile,--\r\n\r\n“In thy younger days thou hast doubtless read with delight the great\r\nChristian poet, whose muse, like the morning it celebrated, came to\r\nearth, ‘crowned with flowers culled in Paradise.’ [‘L’aurea testa Di\r\nrose colte in Paradiso infiora.’ Tasso, “Ger. Lib.” iv. l.)\r\n\r\n“No spirit was more imbued with the knightly superstitions of the time;\r\nand surely the Poet of Jerusalem hath sufficiently, to satisfy even the\r\nInquisitor he consulted, execrated all the practitioners of the unlawful\r\nspells invoked,--\r\n\r\n‘Per isforzar Cocito o Flegetonte.’ (To constrain Cocytus or\r\nPhlegethon.)\r\n\r\n“But in his sorrows and his wrongs, in the prison of his madhouse,\r\nknow you not that Tasso himself found his solace, his escape, in the\r\nrecognition of a holy and spiritual Theurgia,--of a magic that could\r\nsummon the Angel, or the Good Genius, not the Fiend? And do you not\r\nremember how he, deeply versed as he was for his age, in the mysteries\r\nof the nobler Platonism, which hints at the secrets of all the starry\r\nbrotherhoods, from the Chaldean to the later Rosicrucian, discriminates\r\nin his lovely verse, between the black art of Ismeno and the glorious\r\nlore of the Enchanter who counsels and guides upon their errand the\r\nchampions of the Holy Land? HIS, not the charms wrought by the aid of\r\nthe Stygian Rebels (See this remarkable passage, which does indeed\r\nnot unfaithfully represent the doctrine of the Pythagorean and the\r\nPlatonist, in Tasso, cant. xiv. stanzas xli. to xlvii. (“Ger. Lib.”)\r\nThey are beautifully translated by Wiffen.), but the perception of the\r\nsecret powers of the fountain and the herb,--the Arcana of the unknown\r\nnature and the various motions of the stars. His, the holy haunts of\r\nLebanon and Carmel,--beneath his feet he saw the clouds, the snows, the\r\nhues of Iris, the generations of the rains and dews. Did the Christian\r\nHermit who converted that Enchanter (no fabulous being, but the type of\r\nall spirit that would aspire through Nature up to God) command him to\r\nlay aside these sublime studies, ‘Le solite arte e l’ uso mio’? No! but\r\nto cherish and direct them to worthy ends. And in this grand conception\r\nof the poet lies the secret of the true Theurgia, which startles your\r\nignorance in a more learned day with puerile apprehensions, and the\r\nnightmares of a sick man’s dreams.”\r\n\r\nAgain Zanoni paused, and again resumed:--\r\n\r\n“In ages far remote,--of a civilisation far different from that which\r\nnow merges the individual in the state,--there existed men of ardent\r\nminds, and an intense desire of knowledge. In the mighty and solemn\r\nkingdoms in which they dwelt, there were no turbulent and earthly\r\nchannels to work off the fever of their minds. Set in the antique mould\r\nof casts through which no intellect could pierce, no valour could force\r\nits way, the thirst for wisdom alone reigned in the hearts of those who\r\nreceived its study as a heritage from sire to son. Hence, even in your\r\nimperfect records of the progress of human knowledge, you find that, in\r\nthe earliest ages, Philosophy descended not to the business and homes of\r\nmen. It dwelt amidst the wonders of the loftier creation; it sought to\r\nanalyse the formation of matter,--the essentials of the prevailing soul;\r\nto read the mysteries of the starry orbs; to dive into those depths\r\nof Nature in which Zoroaster is said by the schoolmen first to have\r\ndiscovered the arts which your ignorance classes under the name of\r\nmagic. In such an age, then, arose some men, who, amidst the vanities\r\nand delusions of their class, imagined that they detected gleams of a\r\nbrighter and steadier lore. They fancied an affinity existing among all\r\nthe works of Nature, and that in the lowliest lay the secret attraction\r\nthat might conduct them upward to the loftiest. (Agreeably, it would\r\nseem, to the notion of Iamblichus and Plotinus, that the universe is as\r\nan animal; so that there is sympathy and communication between one part\r\nand the other; in the smallest part may be the subtlest nerve. And hence\r\nthe universal magnetism of Nature. But man contemplates the universe as\r\nan animalcule would an elephant. The animalcule, seeing scarcely the tip\r\nof the hoof, would be incapable of comprehending that the trunk belonged\r\nto the same creature,--that the effect produced upon one extremity would\r\nbe felt in an instant by the other.) Centuries passed, and lives were\r\nwasted in these discoveries; but step after step was chronicled and\r\nmarked, and became the guide to the few who alone had the hereditary\r\nprivilege to track their path.\r\n\r\n“At last from this dimness upon some eyes the light broke; but think not,\r\nyoung visionary, that to those who nursed unholy thoughts, over whom\r\nthe Origin of Evil held a sway, that dawning was vouchsafed. It could\r\nbe given then, as now, only to the purest ecstasies of imagination and\r\nintellect, undistracted by the cares of a vulgar life, or the appetites\r\nof the common clay. Far from descending to the assistance of a fiend,\r\ntheirs was but the august ambition to approach nearer to the Fount\r\nof Good; the more they emancipated themselves from this limbo of the\r\nplanets, the more they were penetrated by the splendour and beneficence\r\nof God. And if they sought, and at last discovered, how to the eye of\r\nthe Spirit all the subtler modifications of being and of matter might be\r\nmade apparent; if they discovered how, for the wings of the Spirit, all\r\nspace might be annihilated, and while the body stood heavy and solid\r\nhere, as a deserted tomb, the freed IDEA might wander from star to\r\nstar,--if such discoveries became in truth their own, the sublimest\r\nluxury of their knowledge was but this, to wonder, to venerate, and\r\nadore! For, as one not unlearned in these high matters has expressed it,\r\n‘There is a principle of the soul superior to all external nature,\r\nand through this principle we are capable of surpassing the order and\r\nsystems of the world, and participating the immortal life and the energy\r\nof the Sublime Celestials. When the soul is elevated to natures above\r\nitself, it deserts the order to which it is awhile compelled, and by a\r\nreligious magnetism is attracted to another and a loftier, with which it\r\nblends and mingles.’ (From Iamblichus, “On the Mysteries,” c. 7, sect.\r\n7.) Grant, then, that such beings found at last the secret to arrest\r\ndeath; to fascinate danger and the foe; to walk the revolutions of the\r\nearth unharmed,--think you that this life could teach them other desire\r\nthan to yearn the more for the Immortal, and to fit their intellect the\r\nbetter for the higher being to which they might, when Time and Death\r\nexist no longer, be transferred? Away with your gloomy fantasies of\r\nsorcerer and demon!--the soul can aspire only to the light; and even the\r\nerror of our lofty knowledge was but the forgetfulness of the weakness,\r\nthe passions, and the bonds which the death we so vainly conquered only\r\ncan purge away!”\r\n\r\nThis address was so different from what Glyndon had anticipated, that he\r\nremained for some moments speechless, and at length faltered out,--\r\n\r\n“But why, then, to me--”\r\n\r\n“Why,” added Zanoni,--“why to thee have been only the penance and the\r\nterror,--the Threshold and the Phantom? Vain man! look to the commonest\r\nelements of the common learning. Can every tyro at his mere wish and\r\nwill become the master; can the student, when he has bought his Euclid,\r\nbecome a Newton; can the youth whom the Muses haunt, say, ‘I will equal\r\nHomer;’ yea, can yon pale tyrant, with all the parchment laws of a\r\nhundred system-shapers, and the pikes of his dauntless multitude, carve,\r\nat his will, a constitution not more vicious than the one which the\r\nmadness of a mob could overthrow? When, in that far time to which I have\r\nreferred, the student aspired to the heights to which thou wouldst have\r\nsprung at a single bound, he was trained from his very cradle to the\r\ncareer he was to run. The internal and the outward nature were made\r\nclear to his eyes, year after year, as they opened on the day. He was\r\nnot admitted to the practical initiation till not one earthly wish\r\nchained that sublimest faculty which you call the IMAGINATION, one\r\ncarnal desire clouded the penetrative essence that you call the\r\nINTELLECT. And even then, and at the best, how few attained to the\r\nlast mystery! Happier inasmuch as they attained the earlier to the holy\r\nglories for which Death is the heavenliest gate.”\r\n\r\nZanoni paused, and a shade of thought and sorrow darkened his celestial\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n“And are there, indeed, others, besides thee and Mejnour, who lay claim\r\nto thine attributes, and have attained to thy secrets?”\r\n\r\n“Others there have been before us, but we two now are alone on earth.”\r\n\r\n“Imposter, thou betrayest thyself! If they could conquer Death, why\r\nlive they not yet?” (Glyndon appears to forget that Mejnour had before\r\nanswered the very question which his doubts here a second time suggest.)\r\n\r\n“Child of a day!” answered Zanoni, mournfully, “have I not told thee the\r\nerror of our knowledge was the forgetfulness of the desires and passions\r\nwhich the spirit never can wholly and permanently conquer while this\r\nmatter cloaks it? Canst thou think that it is no sorrow, either to\r\nreject all human ties, all friendship, and all love, or to see, day\r\nafter day, friendship and love wither from our life, as blossoms from\r\nthe stem? Canst thou wonder how, with the power to live while the world\r\nshall last, ere even our ordinary date be finished we yet may prefer to\r\ndie? Wonder rather that there are two who have clung so faithfully to\r\nearth! Me, I confess, that earth can enamour yet. Attaining to the last\r\nsecret while youth was in its bloom, youth still colours all around me\r\nwith its own luxuriant beauty; to me, yet, to breathe is to enjoy. The\r\nfreshness has not faded from the face of Nature, and not an herb in\r\nwhich I cannot discover a new charm,--an undetected wonder.\r\n\r\n“As with my youth, so with Mejnour’s age: he will tell you that life to\r\nhim is but a power to examine; and not till he has exhausted all\r\nthe marvels which the Creator has sown on earth, would he desire new\r\nhabitations for the renewed Spirit to explore. We are the types of the\r\ntwo essences of what is imperishable,--‘ART, that enjoys; and SCIENCE,\r\nthat contemplates!’ And now, that thou mayest be contented that the\r\nsecrets are not vouchsafed to thee, learn that so utterly must the idea\r\ndetach itself from what makes up the occupation and excitement of men;\r\nso must it be void of whatever would covet, or love, or hate,--that for\r\nthe ambitious man, for the lover, the hater, the power avails not. And\r\nI, at last, bound and blinded by the most common of household ties; I,\r\ndarkened and helpless, adjure thee, the baffled and discontented,--I\r\nadjure thee to direct, to guide me; where are they? Oh, tell me,--speak!\r\nMy wife,--my child? Silent!--oh, thou knowest now that I am no sorcerer,\r\nno enemy. I cannot give thee what thy faculties deny,--I cannot achieve\r\nwhat the passionless Mejnour failed to accomplish; but I can give thee\r\nthe next-best boon, perhaps the fairest,--I can reconcile thee to the\r\ndaily world, and place peace between thy conscience and thyself.”\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou promise?”\r\n\r\n“By their sweet lives, I promise!”\r\n\r\nGlyndon looked and believed. He whispered the address to the house\r\nwhither his fatal step already had brought woe and doom.\r\n\r\n“Bless thee for this,” exclaimed Zanoni, passionately, “and thou shalt\r\nbe blessed! What! couldst thou not perceive that at the entrance to all\r\nthe grander worlds dwell the race that intimidate and awe? Who in thy\r\ndaily world ever left the old regions of Custom and Prescription,\r\nand felt not the first seizure of the shapeless and nameless Fear?\r\nEverywhere around thee where men aspire and labour, though they see it\r\nnot,--in the closet of the sage, in the council of the demagogue, in\r\nthe camp of the warrior,--everywhere cowers and darkens the Unutterable\r\nHorror. But there, where thou hast ventured, alone is the Phantom\r\nVISIBLE; and never will it cease to haunt, till thou canst pass to the\r\nInfinite, as the seraph; or return to the Familiar, as a child! But\r\nanswer me this: when, seeking to adhere to some calm resolve of virtue,\r\nthe Phantom hath stalked suddenly to thy side; when its voice hath\r\nwhispered thee despair; when its ghastly eyes would scare thee back to\r\nthose scenes of earthly craft or riotous excitement from which, as\r\nit leaves thee to worse foes to the soul, its presence is ever\r\nabsent,--hast thou never bravely resisted the spectre and thine own\r\nhorror; hast thou never said, ‘Come what may, to Virtue I will cling?’”\r\n\r\n“Alas!” answered Glyndon, “only of late have I dared to do so.”\r\n\r\n“And thou hast felt then that the Phantom grew more dim and its power\r\nmore faint?”\r\n\r\n“It is true.”\r\n\r\n“Rejoice, then!--thou hast overcome the true terror and mystery of the\r\nordeal. Resolve is the first success. Rejoice, for the exorcism is sure!\r\nThou art not of those who, denying a life to come, are the victims of\r\nthe Inexorable Horror. Oh, when shall men learn, at last, that if the\r\nGreat Religion inculcates so rigidly the necessity of FAITH, it is not\r\nalone that FAITH leads to the world to be; but that without faith there\r\nis no excellence in this,--faith in something wiser, happier, diviner,\r\nthan we see on earth!--the artist calls it the Ideal,--the priest,\r\nFaith. The Ideal and Faith are one and the same. Return, O wanderer,\r\nreturn! Feel what beauty and holiness dwell in the Customary and the\r\nOld. Back to thy gateway glide, thou Horror! and calm, on the childlike\r\nheart, smile again, O azure Heaven, with thy night and thy morning star\r\nbut as one, though under its double name of Memory and Hope!”\r\n\r\nAs he thus spoke, Zanoni laid his hand gently on the burning temples of\r\nhis excited and wondering listener; and presently a sort of trance came\r\nover him: he imagined that he was returned to the home of his infancy;\r\nthat he was in the small chamber where, over his early slumbers,\r\nhis mother had watched and prayed. There it was,--visible, palpable,\r\nsolitary, unaltered. In the recess, the homely bed; on the walls, the\r\nshelves filled with holy books; the very easel on which he had first\r\nsought to call the ideal to the canvas, dust-covered, broken, in the\r\ncorner. Below the window lay the old churchyard: he saw it green in the\r\ndistance, the sun glancing through the yew-trees; he saw the tomb where\r\nfather and mother lay united, and the spire pointing up to heaven, the\r\nsymbol of the hopes of those who consigned the ashes to the dust; in\r\nhis ear rang the bells, pealing, as on a Sabbath day. Far fled all\r\nthe visions of anxiety and awe that had haunted and convulsed; youth,\r\nboyhood, childhood came back to him with innocent desires and hopes; he\r\nthought he fell upon his knees to pray. He woke,--he woke in\r\ndelicious tears, he felt that the Phantom was fled forever. He looked\r\nround,--Zanoni was gone. On the table lay these lines, the ink yet\r\nwet:--\r\n\r\n“I will find ways and means for thy escape. At nightfall, as the clock\r\nstrikes nine, a boat shall wait thee on the river before this house;\r\nthe boatman will guide thee to a retreat where thou mayst rest in safety\r\ntill the Reign of Terror, which nears its close, be past. Think no more\r\nof the sensual love that lured, and wellnigh lost thee. It betrayed, and\r\nwould have destroyed. Thou wilt regain thy land in safety,--long years\r\nyet spared to thee to muse over the past, and to redeem it. For thy\r\nfuture, be thy dream thy guide, and thy tears thy baptism.”\r\n\r\nThe Englishman obeyed the injunctions of the letter, and found their\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.X.\r\n\r\n     Quid mirare meas tot in uno corpore formas?\r\n     Propert.\r\n\r\n     (Why wonder that I have so many forms in a single body?)\r\n\r\nZanoni to Mejnour.\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\n“She is in one of their prisons,--their inexorable prisons. It is\r\nRobespierre’s order,--I have tracked the cause to Glyndon. This, then,\r\nmade that terrible connection between their fates which I could not\r\nunravel, but which (till severed as it now is) wrapped Glyndon himself\r\nin the same cloud that concealed her. In prison,--in prison!--it is the\r\ngate of the grave! Her trial, and the inevitable execution that follows\r\nsuch trial, is the third day from this. The tyrant has fixed all his\r\nschemes of slaughter for the 10th of Thermidor. While the deaths of the\r\nunoffending strike awe to the city, his satellites are to massacre his\r\nfoes. There is but one hope left,--that the Power which now dooms the\r\ndoomer, may render me an instrument to expedite his fall. But two\r\ndays left,--two days! In all my wealth of time I see but two days; all\r\nbeyond,--darkness, solitude. I may save her yet. The tyrant shall fall\r\nthe day before that which he has set apart for slaughter! For the first\r\ntime I mix among the broils and stratagems of men, and my mind leaps up\r\nfrom my despair, armed and eager for the contest.”\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nA crowd had gathered round the Rue St. Honore; a young man was just\r\narrested by the order of Robespierre. He was known to be in the service\r\nof Tallien, that hostile leader in the Convention, whom the tyrant had\r\nhitherto trembled to attack. This incident had therefore produced a\r\ngreater excitement than a circumstance so customary as an arrest in the\r\nReign of Terror might be supposed to create. Amongst the crowd were many\r\nfriends of Tallien, many foes to the tyrant, many weary of beholding\r\nthe tiger dragging victim after victim to its den. Hoarse, foreboding\r\nmurmurs were heard; fierce eyes glared upon the officers as they seized\r\ntheir prisoner; and though they did not yet dare openly to resist, those\r\nin the rear pressed on those behind, and encumbered the path of the\r\ncaptive and his captors. The young man struggled hard for escape, and,\r\nby a violent effort, at last wrenched himself from the grasp. The\r\ncrowd made way, and closed round to protect him, as he dived and darted\r\nthrough their ranks; but suddenly the trampling of horses was heard at\r\nhand,--the savage Henriot and his troop were bearing down upon the mob.\r\nThe crowd gave way in alarm, and the prisoner was again seized by one\r\nof the partisans of the Dictator. At that moment a voice whispered the\r\nprisoner, “Thou hast a letter which, if found on thee, ruins thy last\r\nhope. Give it to me! I will bear it to Tallien.” The prisoner turned in\r\namaze, read something that encouraged him in the eyes of the stranger\r\nwho thus accosted him. The troop were now on the spot; the Jacobin who\r\nhad seized the prisoner released hold of him for a moment to escape\r\nthe hoofs of the horses: in that moment the opportunity was found,--the\r\nstranger had disappeared.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nAt the house of Tallien the principal foes of the tyrant were assembled.\r\nCommon danger made common fellowship. All factions laid aside their\r\nfeuds for the hour to unite against the formidable man who was marching\r\nover all factions to his gory throne. There was bold Lecointre, the\r\ndeclared enemy; there, creeping Barrere, who would reconcile all\r\nextremes, the hero of the cowards; Barras, calm and collected; Collet\r\nd’Herbois, breathing wrath and vengeance, and seeing not that the crimes\r\nof Robespierre alone sheltered his own.\r\n\r\nThe council was agitated and irresolute. The awe which the uniform\r\nsuccess and the prodigious energy of Robespierre excited still held the\r\ngreater part under its control. Tallien, whom the tyrant most feared,\r\nand who alone could give head and substance and direction to so many\r\ncontradictory passions, was too sullied by the memory of his own\r\ncruelties not to feel embarrassed by his position as the champion\r\nof mercy. “It is true,” he said, after an animating harangue from\r\nLecointre, “that the Usurper menaces us all. But he is still so beloved\r\nby his mobs,--still so supported by his Jacobins: better delay open\r\nhostilities till the hour is more ripe. To attempt and not succeed is\r\nto give us, bound hand and foot, to the guillotine. Every day his power\r\nmust decline. Procrastination is our best ally--” While yet speaking,\r\nand while yet producing the effect of water on the fire, it was\r\nannounced that a stranger demanded to see him instantly on business that\r\nbrooked no delay.\r\n\r\n“I am not at leisure,” said the orator, impatiently. The servant placed\r\na note on the table. Tallien opened it, and found these words in pencil,\r\n“From the prison of Teresa de Fontenai.” He turned pale, started up,\r\nand hastened to the anteroom, where he beheld a face entirely strange to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Hope of France!” said the visitor to him, and the very sound of his\r\nvoice went straight to the heart,--“your servant is arrested in the\r\nstreets. I have saved your life, and that of your wife who will be. I\r\nbring to you this letter from Teresa de Fontenai.”\r\n\r\nTallien, with a trembling hand, opened the letter, and read,--\r\n\r\n“Am I forever to implore you in vain? Again and again I say, ‘Lose not\r\nan hour if you value my life and your own.’ My trial and death are fixed\r\nthe third day from this,--the 10th Thermidor. Strike while it is yet\r\ntime,--strike the monster!--you have two days yet. If you fail,--if you\r\nprocrastinate,--see me for the last time as I pass your windows to the\r\nguillotine!”\r\n\r\n“Her trial will give proof against you,” said the stranger. “Her death\r\nis the herald of your own. Fear not the populace,--the populace would\r\nhave rescued your servant. Fear not Robespierre,--he gives himself to\r\nyour hands. To-morrow he comes to the Convention,--to-morrow you must\r\ncast the last throw for his head or your own.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow he comes to the Convention! And who are you that know so well\r\nwhat is concealed from me?”\r\n\r\n“A man like you, who would save the woman he loves.”\r\n\r\nBefore Tallien could recover his surprise, the visitor was gone.\r\n\r\nBack went the Avenger to his conclave an altered man. “I have heard\r\ntidings,--no matter what,” he cried,--“that have changed my purpose.\r\nOn the 10th we are destined to the guillotine. I revoke my counsel for\r\ndelay. Robespierre comes to the Convention to-morrow; THERE we must\r\nconfront and crush him. From the Mountain shall frown against him\r\nthe grim shade of Danton,--from the Plain shall rise, in their bloody\r\ncerements, the spectres of Vergniaud and Condorcet. Frappons!”\r\n\r\n“Frappons!” cried even Barrere, startled into energy by the new daring\r\nof his colleague,--“frappons! il n’y a que les morts qui ne reviennent\r\npas.”\r\n\r\nIt was observable (and the fact may be found in one of the memoirs\r\nof the time) that, during that day and night (the 7th Thermidor), a\r\nstranger to all the previous events of that stormy time was seen in\r\nvarious parts of the city,--in the cafes, the clubs, the haunts of the\r\nvarious factions; that, to the astonishment and dismay of his hearers,\r\nhe talked aloud of the crimes of Robespierre, and predicted his coming\r\nfall; and, as he spoke, he stirred up the hearts of men, he loosed the\r\nbonds of their fear,--he inflamed them with unwonted rage and daring.\r\nBut what surprised them most was, that no voice replied, no hand was\r\nlifted against him, no minion, even of the tyrant, cried, “Arrest the\r\ntraitor.” In that impunity men read, as in a book, that the populace had\r\ndeserted the man of blood.\r\n\r\nOnce only a fierce, brawny Jacobin sprang up from the table at which he\r\nsat, drinking deep, and, approaching the stranger, said, “I seize thee,\r\nin the name of the Republic.”\r\n\r\n“Citizen Aristides,” answered the stranger, in a whisper, “go to the\r\nlodgings of Robespierre,--he is from home; and in the left pocket of the\r\nvest which he cast off not an hour since thou wilt find a paper; when\r\nthou hast read that, return. I will await thee; and if thou wouldst then\r\nseize me, I will go without a struggle. Look round on those lowering\r\nbrows; touch me NOW, and thou wilt be torn to pieces.”\r\n\r\nThe Jacobin felt as if compelled to obey against his will. He went\r\nforth muttering; he returned,--the stranger was still there. “Mille\r\ntonnerres,” he said to him, “I thank thee; the poltroon had my name in\r\nhis list for the guillotine.”\r\n\r\nWith that the Jacobin Aristides sprang upon the table and shouted,\r\n“Death to the Tyrant!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.XI.\r\n\r\n     Le lendemain, 8 Thermidor, Robespierre se decida a prononcer son\r\n     fameux discours.\r\n     --Thiers, “Hist. de la Revolution.”\r\n\r\n     (The next day, 8th Thermidor, Robespierre resolved to deliver his\r\n     celebrated discourse.)\r\n\r\nThe morning rose,--the 8th of Thermidor (July 26). Robespierre has gone\r\nto the Convention. He has gone with his laboured speech; he has gone\r\nwith his phrases of philanthropy and virtue; he has gone to single out\r\nhis prey. All his agents are prepared for his reception; the fierce St.\r\nJust has arrived from the armies to second his courage and inflame his\r\nwrath. His ominous apparition prepares the audience for the crisis.\r\n“Citizens!” screeched the shrill voice of Robespierre “others have\r\nplaced before you flattering pictures; I come to announce to you useful\r\ntruths.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“And they attribute to me,--to me alone!--whatever of harsh or evil\r\nis committed: it is Robespierre who wishes it; it is Robespierre who\r\nordains it. Is there a new tax?--it is Robespierre who ruins you. They\r\ncall me tyrant!--and why? Because I have acquired some influence; but\r\nhow?--in speaking truth; and who pretends that truth is to be without\r\nforce in the mouths of the Representatives of the French people?\r\nDoubtless, truth has its power, its rage, its despotism, its accents,\r\ntouching, terrible, which resound in the pure heart as in the guilty\r\nconscience; and which Falsehood can no more imitate than Salmoneus could\r\nforge the thunderbolts of Heaven. What am I whom they accuse? A slave\r\nof liberty,--a living martyr of the Republic; the victim as the enemy of\r\ncrime! All ruffianism affronts me, and actions legitimate in others are\r\ncrimes in me. It is enough to know me to be calumniated. It is in my\r\nvery zeal that they discover my guilt. Take from me my conscience, and I\r\nshould be the most miserable of men!”\r\n\r\nHe paused; and Couthon wiped his eyes, and St. Just murmured applause\r\nas with stern looks he gazed on the rebellious Mountain; and there was a\r\ndead, mournful, and chilling silence through the audience. The touching\r\nsentiment woke no echo.\r\n\r\nThe orator cast his eyes around. Ho! he will soon arouse that apathy.\r\nHe proceeds, he praises, he pities himself no more. He denounces,--he\r\naccuses. Overflooded with his venom, he vomits it forth on all. At home,\r\nabroad, finances, war,--on all! Shriller and sharper rose his voice,--\r\n\r\n“A conspiracy exists against the public liberty. It owes its strength\r\nto a criminal coalition in the very bosom of the Convention; it has\r\naccomplices in the bosom of the Committee of Public Safety...What is the\r\nremedy to this evil? To punish the traitors; to purify this committee;\r\nto crush all factions by the weight of the National Authority; to\r\nraise upon their ruins the power of Liberty and Justice. Such are the\r\nprinciples of that Reform. Must I be ambitious to profess them?--then\r\nthe principles are proscribed, and Tyranny reigns amongst us! For what\r\ncan you object to a man who is in the right, and has at least this\r\nknowledge,--he knows how to die for his native land! I am made to combat\r\ncrime, and not to govern it. The time, alas! is not yet arrived when men\r\nof worth can serve with impunity their country. So long as the knaves\r\nrule, the defenders of liberty will be only the proscribed.”\r\n\r\nFor two hours, through that cold and gloomy audience, shrilled the\r\nDeath-speech. In silence it began, in silence closed. The enemies of the\r\norator were afraid to express resentment; they knew not yet the exact\r\nbalance of power. His partisans were afraid to approve; they knew not\r\nwhom of their own friends and relations the accusations were designed to\r\nsingle forth. “Take care!” whispered each to each; “it is thou whom\r\nhe threatens.” But silent though the audience, it was, at the first,\r\nwellnigh subdued. There was still about this terrible man the spell\r\nof an overmastering will. Always--though not what is called a great\r\norator--resolute, and sovereign in the use of words; words seemed as\r\nthings when uttered by one who with a nod moved the troops of Henriot,\r\nand influenced the judgment of Rene Dumas, grim President of the\r\nTribunal. Lecointre of Versailles rose, and there was an anxious\r\nmovement of attention; for Lecointre was one of the fiercest foes of the\r\ntyrant. What was the dismay of the Tallien faction; what the complacent\r\nsmile of Couthon,--when Lecointre demanded only that the oration should\r\nbe printed! All seemed paralyzed. At length Bourdon de l’Oise, whose\r\nname was doubly marked in the black list of the Dictator, stalked to the\r\ntribune, and moved the bold counter-resolution, that the speech should\r\nbe referred to the two committees whom that very speech accused. Still\r\nno applause from the conspirators; they sat torpid as frozen men. The\r\nshrinking Barrere, ever on the prudent side, looked round before he\r\nrose. He rises, and sides with Lecointre! Then Couthon seized the\r\noccasion, and from his seat (a privilege permitted only to the paralytic\r\nphilanthropist) (M. Thiers in his History, volume iv. page 79, makes\r\na curious blunder: he says, “Couthon s’elance a la tribune.” (Couthon\r\ndarted towards the tribune.) Poor Couthon! whose half body was dead,\r\nand who was always wheeled in his chair into the Convention, and spoke\r\nsitting.), and with his melodious voice sought to convert the crisis\r\ninto a triumph.\r\n\r\nHe demanded, not only that the harangue should be printed, but sent\r\nto all the communes and all the armies. It was necessary to soothe\r\na wronged and ulcerated heart. Deputies, the most faithful, had been\r\naccused of shedding blood. “Ah! if HE had contributed to the death of\r\none innocent man, he should immolate himself with grief.” Beautiful\r\ntenderness!--and while he spoke, he fondled the spaniel in his bosom.\r\nBravo, Couthon! Robespierre triumphs! The reign of Terror shall endure!\r\nThe old submission settles dovelike back in the assembly! They vote\r\nthe printing of the Death-speech, and its transmission to all the\r\nmunicipalities. From the benches of the Mountain, Tallien, alarmed,\r\ndismayed, impatient, and indignant, cast his gaze where sat the\r\nstrangers admitted to hear the debates; and suddenly he met the eyes of\r\nthe Unknown who had brought to him the letter from Teresa de Fontenai\r\nthe preceding day. The eyes fascinated him as he gazed. In aftertimes he\r\noften said that their regard, fixed, earnest, half-reproachful, and\r\nyet cheering and triumphant, filled him with new life and courage. They\r\nspoke to his heart as the trumpet speaks to the war-horse. He moved from\r\nhis seat; he whispered with his allies: the spirit he had drawn in was\r\ncontagious; the men whom Robespierre especially had denounced, and who\r\nsaw the sword over their heads, woke from their torpid trance. Vadier,\r\nCambon, Billaud-Varennes, Panis, Amar, rose at once,--all at once\r\ndemanded speech. Vadier is first heard, the rest succeed. It burst\r\nforth, the Mountain, with its fires and consuming lava; flood upon flood\r\nthey rush, a legion of Ciceros upon the startled Catiline! Robespierre\r\nfalters, hesitates,--would qualify, retract. They gather new courage\r\nfrom his new fears; they interrupt him; they drown his voice; they\r\ndemand the reversal of the motion. Amar moves again that the speech\r\nbe referred to the Committees, to the Committees,--to his enemies!\r\nConfusion and noise and clamour! Robespierre wraps himself in silent\r\nand superb disdain. Pale, defeated, but not yet destroyed, he\r\nstands,--a storm in the midst of storm!\r\n\r\nThe motion is carried. All men foresee in that defeat the Dictator’s\r\ndownfall. A solitary cry rose from the galleries; it was caught up;\r\nit circled through the hall, the audience: “A bas le tyrant! Vive la\r\nrepublique!” (Down with the tyrant! Hurrah for the republic!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.XII.\r\n\r\n     Aupres d’un corps aussi avili que la Convention, il restait des\r\n     chances pour que Robespierre sortit vainqueur de cette lutte.\r\n     Lacretelle, volume xii.\r\n\r\n     (Amongst a body so debased as the Convention, there still\r\n     remained some chances that Robespierre would come off victor in\r\n     the struggle.)\r\n\r\nAs Robespierre left the hall, there was a dead and ominous silence in\r\nthe crowd without. The herd, in every country, side with success;\r\nand the rats run from the falling tower. But Robespierre, who wanted\r\ncourage, never wanted pride, and the last often supplied the place\r\nof the first; thoughtfully, and with an impenetrable brow, he passed\r\nthrough the throng, leaning on St. Just, Payan and his brother following\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs they got into the open space, Robespierre abruptly broke the silence.\r\n\r\n“How many heads were to fall upon the tenth?”\r\n\r\n“Eighty,” replied Payan.\r\n\r\n“Ah, we must not tarry so long; a day may lose an empire: terrorism must\r\nserve us yet!”\r\n\r\nHe was silent a few moments, and his eyes roved suspiciously through the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n“St. Just,” he said abruptly, “they have not found this Englishman\r\nwhose revelations, or whose trial, would have crushed the Amars and the\r\nTalliens. No, no! my Jacobins themselves are growing dull and blind. But\r\nthey have seized a woman,--only a woman!”\r\n\r\n“A woman’s hand stabbed Marat,” said St. Just. Robespierre stopped\r\nshort, and breathed hard.\r\n\r\n“St. Just,” said he, “when this peril is past, we will found the Reign\r\nof Peace. There shall be homes and gardens set apart for the old. David\r\nis already designing the porticos. Virtuous men shall be appointed to\r\ninstruct the young. All vice and disorder shall be NOT exterminated--no,\r\nno! only banished! We must not die yet. Posterity cannot judge us till\r\nour work is done. We have recalled L’Etre Supreme; we must now remodel\r\nthis corrupted world. All shall be love and brotherhood; and--ho! Simon!\r\nSimon!--hold! Your pencil, St. Just!” And Robespierre wrote hastily.\r\n“This to Citizen President Dumas. Go with it quick, Simon. These eighty\r\nheads must fall TO-MORROW,--TO-MORROW, Simon. Dumas will advance their\r\ntrial a day. I will write to Fouquier-Tinville, the public accuser.\r\nWe meet at the Jacobins to-night, Simon; there we will denounce the\r\nConvention itself; there we will rally round us the last friends of\r\nliberty and France.”\r\n\r\nA shout was heard in the distance behind, “Vive la republique!”\r\n\r\nThe tyrant’s eye shot a vindictive gleam. “The republic!--faugh! We did\r\nnot destroy the throne of a thousand years for that canaille!”\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL, THE EXECUTION, OF THE VICTIMS IS ADVANCED A DAY! By the\r\naid of the mysterious intelligence that had guided and animated him\r\nhitherto, Zanoni learned that his arts had been in vain. He knew that\r\nViola was safe, if she could but survive an hour the life of the\r\ntyrant. He knew that Robespierre’s hours were numbered; that the 10th of\r\nThermidor, on which he had originally designed the execution of his\r\nlast victims, would see himself at the scaffold. Zanoni had toiled, had\r\nschemed for the fall of the Butcher and his reign. To what end? A single\r\nword from the tyrant had baffled the result of all. The execution\r\nof Viola is advanced a day. Vain seer, who wouldst make thyself the\r\ninstrument of the Eternal, the very dangers that now beset the tyrant\r\nbut expedite the doom of his victims! To-morrow, eighty heads, and\r\nhers whose pillow has been thy heart! To-morrow! and Maximilien is safe\r\nto-night!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.XIII.\r\n\r\n     Erde mag zuruck in Erde stauben;\r\n     Fliegt der Geist doch aus dem morschen Haus.\r\n     Seine Asche mag der Sturmwind treiben,\r\n     Sein Leben dauert ewig aus!\r\n     Elegie.\r\n\r\n     (Earth may crumble back into earth; the Spirit will still escape\r\n     from its frail tenement.  The wind of the storm may scatter his\r\n     ashes; his being endures forever.)\r\n\r\nTo-morrow!--and it is already twilight. One after one, the gentle stars\r\ncome smiling through the heaven. The Seine, in its slow waters, yet\r\ntrembles with the last kiss of the rosy day; and still in the blue sky\r\ngleams the spire of Notre Dame; and still in the blue sky looms the\r\nguillotine by the Barriere du Trone. Turn to that time-worn building,\r\nonce the church and the convent of the Freres-Precheurs, known by the\r\nthen holy name of Jacobins; there the new Jacobins hold their club.\r\nThere, in that oblong hall, once the library of the peaceful monks,\r\nassemble the idolaters of St. Robespierre. Two immense tribunes,\r\nraised at either end, contain the lees and dregs of the atrocious\r\npopulace,--the majority of that audience consisting of the furies of\r\nthe guillotine (furies de guillotine). In the midst of the hall are\r\nthe bureau and chair of the president,--the chair long preserved by the\r\npiety of the monks as the relic of St. Thomas Aquinas! Above this seat\r\nscowls the harsh bust of Brutus. An iron lamp and two branches scatter\r\nover the vast room a murky, fuliginous ray, beneath the light of which\r\nthe fierce faces of that Pandemonium seem more grim and haggard. There,\r\nfrom the orator’s tribune, shrieks the shrill wrath of Robespierre!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all is chaos, disorder, half daring and half cowardice, in the\r\nCommittee of his foes. Rumours fly from street to street, from haunt to\r\nhaunt, from house to house. The swallows flit low, and the cattle group\r\ntogether before the storm. And above this roar of the lives and things\r\nof the little hour, alone in his chamber stood he on whose starry\r\nyouth--symbol of the imperishable bloom of the calm Ideal amidst the\r\nmouldering Actual--the clouds of ages had rolled in vain.\r\n\r\nAll those exertions which ordinary wit and courage could suggest had\r\nbeen tried in vain. All such exertions WERE in vain, where, in that\r\nSaturnalia of death, a life was the object. Nothing but the fall of\r\nRobespierre could have saved his victims; now, too late, that fall would\r\nonly serve to avenge.\r\n\r\nOnce more, in that last agony of excitement and despair, the seer had\r\nplunged into solitude, to invoke again the aid or counsel of those\r\nmysterious intermediates between earth and heaven who had renounced the\r\nintercourse of the spirit when subjected to the common bondage of the\r\nmortal. In the intense desire and anguish of his heart, perhaps, lay a\r\npower not yet called forth; for who has not felt that the sharpness\r\nof extreme grief cuts and grinds away many of those strongest bonds\r\nof infirmity and doubt which bind down the souls of men to the cabined\r\ndarkness of the hour; and that from the cloud and thunderstorm often\r\nswoops the Olympian eagle that can ravish us aloft!\r\n\r\nAnd the invocation was heard,--the bondage of sense was rent away from\r\nthe visual mind. He looked, and saw,--no, not the being he had called,\r\nwith its limbs of light and unutterably tranquil smile--not his\r\nfamiliar, Adon-Ai, the Son of Glory and the Star, but the Evil Omen, the\r\ndark Chimera, the implacable Foe, with exultation and malice burning in\r\nits hell-lit eyes. The Spectre, no longer cowering and retreating into\r\nshadow, rose before him, gigantic and erect; the face, whose veil no\r\nmortal hand had ever raised, was still concealed, but the form was more\r\ndistinct, corporeal, and cast from it, as an atmosphere, horror and rage\r\nand awe. As an iceberg, the breath of that presence froze the air; as a\r\ncloud, it filled the chamber and blackened the stars from heaven.\r\n\r\n“Lo!” said its voice, “I am here once more. Thou hast robbed me of a\r\nmeaner prey. Now exorcise THYSELF from my power! Thy life has left thee,\r\nto live in the heart of a daughter of the charnel and the worm. In that\r\nlife I come to thee with my inexorable tread. Thou art returned to the\r\nThreshold,--thou, whose steps have trodden the verges of the Infinite!\r\nAnd as the goblin of its fantasy seizes on a child in the dark,--mighty\r\none, who wouldst conquer Death,--I seize on thee!”\r\n\r\n“Back to thy thraldom, slave! If thou art come to the voice that called\r\nthee not, it is again not to command, but to obey! Thou, from whose\r\nwhisper I gained the boons of the lives lovelier and dearer than my own;\r\nthou--I command thee, not by spell and charm, but by the force of a soul\r\nmightier than the malice of thy being,--thou serve me yet, and speak\r\nagain the secret that can rescue the lives thou hast, by permission of\r\nthe Universal Master, permitted me to retain awhile in the temple of the\r\nclay!”\r\n\r\nBrighter and more devouringly burned the glare from those lurid eyes;\r\nmore visible and colossal yet rose the dilating shape; a yet fiercer and\r\nmore disdainful hate spoke in the voice that answered, “Didst thou think\r\nthat my boon would be other than thy curse? Happy for thee hadst thou\r\nmourned over the deaths which come by the gentle hand of Nature,--hadst\r\nthou never known how the name of mother consecrates the face of Beauty,\r\nand never, bending over thy first-born, felt the imperishable sweetness\r\nof a father’s love! They are saved, for what?--the mother, for the death\r\nof violence and shame and blood, for the doomsman’s hand to put aside\r\nthat shining hair which has entangled thy bridegroom kisses; the child,\r\nfirst and last of thine offspring, in whom thou didst hope to found a\r\nrace that should hear with thee the music of celestial harps, and\r\nfloat, by the side of thy familiar, Adon-Ai, through the azure rivers of\r\njoy,--the child, to live on a few days as a fungus in a burial-vault, a\r\nthing of the loathsome dungeon, dying of cruelty and neglect and famine.\r\nHa! ha! thou who wouldst baffle Death, learn how the deathless die if\r\nthey dare to love the mortal. Now, Chaldean, behold my boons! Now I\r\nseize and wrap thee with the pestilence of my presence; now, evermore,\r\ntill thy long race is run, mine eyes shall glow into thy brain, and mine\r\narms shall clasp thee, when thou wouldst take the wings of the Morning\r\nand flee from the embrace of Night!”\r\n\r\n“I tell thee, no! And again I compel thee, speak and answer to the lord\r\nwho can command his slave. I know, though my lore fails me, and the\r\nreeds on which I leaned pierce my side,--I know yet that it is written\r\nthat the life of which I question can be saved from the headsman. Thou\r\nwrappest her future in the darkness of thy shadow, but thou canst not\r\nshape it. Thou mayest foreshow the antidote; thou canst not effect the\r\nbane. From thee I wring the secret, though it torture thee to name it.\r\nI approach thee,--I look dauntless into thine eyes. The soul that loves\r\ncan dare all things. Shadow, I defy thee, and compel!”\r\n\r\nThe spectre waned and recoiled. Like a vapour that lessens as the sun\r\npierces and pervades it, the form shrank cowering and dwarfed in the\r\ndimmer distance, and through the casement again rushed the stars.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the Voice, with a faint and hollow accent, “thou CANST save\r\nher from the headsman; for it is written, that sacrifice can save. Ha!\r\nha!” And the shape again suddenly dilated into the gloom of its giant\r\nstature, and its ghastly laugh exulted, as if the Foe, a moment baffled,\r\nhad regained its might. “Ha! ha!--thou canst save her life, if thou wilt\r\nsacrifice thine own! Is it for this thou hast lived on through crumbling\r\nempires and countless generations of thy race? At last shall Death\r\nreclaim thee? Wouldst thou save her?--DIE FOR HER! Fall, O stately\r\ncolumn, over which stars yet unformed may gleam,--fall, that the herb at\r\nthy base may drink a few hours longer the sunlight and the dews! Silent!\r\nArt thou ready for the sacrifice? See, the moon moves up through\r\nheaven. Beautiful and wise one, wilt thou bid her smile to-morrow on thy\r\nheadless clay?”\r\n\r\n“Back! for my soul, in answering thee from depths where thou canst not\r\nhear it, has regained its glory; and I hear the wings of Adon-Ai gliding\r\nmusical through the air.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke; and, with a low shriek of baffled rage and hate, the Thing was\r\ngone, and through the room rushed, luminous and sudden, the Presence of\r\nsilvery light.\r\n\r\nAs the heavenly visitor stood in the atmosphere of his own lustre,\r\nand looked upon the face of the Theurgist with an aspect of ineffable\r\ntenderness and love, all space seemed lighted from his smile. Along the\r\nblue air without, from that chamber in which his wings had halted, to\r\nthe farthest star in the azure distance, it seemed as if the track of\r\nhis flight were visible, by a lengthened splendour in the air, like the\r\ncolumn of moonlight on the sea. Like the flower that diffuses perfume as\r\nthe very breath of its life, so the emanation of that presence was joy.\r\nOver the world, as a million times swifter than light, than electricity,\r\nthe Son of Glory had sped his way to the side of love, his wings had\r\nscattered delight as the morning scatters dew. For that brief moment,\r\nPoverty had ceased to mourn, Disease fled from its prey, and Hope\r\nbreathed a dream of Heaven into the darkness of Despair.\r\n\r\n“Thou art right,” said the melodious Voice. “Thy courage has restored\r\nthy power. Once more, in the haunts of earth, thy soul charms me to thy\r\nside. Wiser now, in the moment when thou comprehendest Death, than when\r\nthy unfettered spirit learned the solemn mystery of Life; the human\r\naffections that thralled and humbled thee awhile bring to thee, in these\r\nlast hours of thy mortality, the sublimest heritage of thy race,--the\r\neternity that commences from the grave.”\r\n\r\n“O Adon-Ai,” said the Chaldean, as, circumfused in the splendour of the\r\nvisitant, a glory more radiant than human beauty settled round his form,\r\nand seemed already to belong to the eternity of which the Bright One\r\nspoke, “as men, before they die, see and comprehend the enigmas hidden\r\nfrom them before (The greatest poet, and one of the noblest thinkers, of\r\nthe last age, said, on his deathbed, “Many things obscure to me before,\r\nnow clear up, and become visible.”--See the ‘Life of Schiller.’), “so in\r\nthis hour, when the sacrifice of self to another brings the course of\r\nages to its goal, I see the littleness of Life, compared to the majesty\r\nof Death; but oh, Divine Consoler, even here, even in thy presence,\r\nthe affections that inspire me, sadden. To leave behind me in this\r\nbad world, unaided, unprotected, those for whom I die! the wife! the\r\nchild!--oh, speak comfort to me in this!”\r\n\r\n“And what,” said the visitor, with a slight accent of reproof in the\r\ntone of celestial pity,--“what, with all thy wisdom and thy starry\r\nsecrets, with all thy empire of the past, and thy visions of the future;\r\nwhat art thou to the All-Directing and Omniscient? Canst thou yet\r\nimagine that thy presence on earth can give to the hearts thou lovest\r\nthe shelter which the humblest take from the wings of the Presence that\r\nlives in heaven? Fear not thou for their future. Whether thou live or\r\ndie, their future is the care of the Most High! In the dungeon and on\r\nthe scaffold looks everlasting the Eye of HIM, tenderer than thou to\r\nlove, wiser than thou to guide, mightier than thou to save!”\r\n\r\nZanoni bowed his head; and when he looked up again, the last shadow had\r\nleft his brow. The visitor was gone; but still the glory of his presence\r\nseemed to shine upon the spot, still the solitary air seemed to murmur\r\nwith tremulous delight. And thus ever shall it be with those who have\r\nonce, detaching themselves utterly from life, received the visit of the\r\nAngel FAITH. Solitude and space retain the splendour, and it settles\r\nlike a halo round their graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.XIV.\r\n\r\n     Dann zur Blumenflor der Sterne\r\n     Aufgeschauet liebewarm,\r\n     Fass’ ihn freundlich Arm in Arm\r\n     Trag’ ihn in die blaue Ferne.\r\n     --Uhland, “An den Tod.”\r\n\r\n     Then towards the Garden of the Star\r\n     Lift up thine aspect warm with love,\r\n     And, friendlike link’d through space afar,\r\n     Mount with him, arm in arm, above.\r\n     --Uhland, “Poem to Death.”\r\n\r\nHe stood upon the lofty balcony that overlooked the quiet city. Though\r\nafar, the fiercest passions of men were at work on the web of strife and\r\ndoom, all that gave itself to his view was calm and still in the rays\r\nof the summer moon, for his soul was wrapped from man and man’s narrow\r\nsphere, and only the serener glories of creation were present to the\r\nvision of the seer. There he stood, alone and thoughtful, to take the\r\nlast farewell of the wondrous life that he had known.\r\n\r\nCoursing through the fields of space, he beheld the gossamer shapes,\r\nwhose choral joys his spirit had so often shared. There, group upon\r\ngroup, they circled in the starry silence multiform in the unimaginable\r\nbeauty of a being fed by ambrosial dews and serenest light. In his\r\ntrance, all the universe stretched visible beyond; in the green valleys\r\nafar, he saw the dances of the fairies; in the bowels of the mountains,\r\nhe beheld the race that breathe the lurid air of the volcanoes, and hide\r\nfrom the light of heaven; on every leaf in the numberless forests, in\r\nevery drop of the unmeasured seas, he surveyed its separate and swarming\r\nworld; far up, in the farthest blue, he saw orb upon orb ripening into\r\nshape, and planets starting from the central fire, to run their day\r\nof ten thousand years. For everywhere in creation is the breath of the\r\nCreator, and in every spot where the breath breathes is life! And alone,\r\nin the distance, the lonely man beheld his Magian brother. There,\r\nat work with his numbers and his Cabala, amidst the wrecks of Rome,\r\npassionless and calm, sat in his cell the mystic Mejnour,--living on,\r\nliving ever while the world lasts, indifferent whether his knowledge\r\nproduces weal or woe; a mechanical agent of a more tender and a wiser\r\nwill, that guides every spring to its inscrutable designs. Living\r\non,--living ever,--as science that cares alone for knowledge, and halts\r\nnot to consider how knowledge advances happiness; how Human Improvement,\r\nrushing through civilisation, crushes in its march all who cannot\r\ngrapple to its wheels (“You colonise the lands of the savage with the\r\nAnglo-Saxon,--you civilise that portion of THE EARTH; but is the SAVAGE\r\ncivilised? He is exterminated! You accumulate machinery,--you increase\r\nthe total of wealth; but what becomes of the labour you displace? One\r\ngeneration is sacrificed to the next. You diffuse knowledge,--and\r\nthe world seems to grow brighter; but Discontent at Poverty replaces\r\nIgnorance, happy with its crust. Every improvement, every advancement in\r\ncivilisation, injures some, to benefit others, and either cherishes\r\nthe want of to-day, or prepares the revolution of to-morrow.”--Stephen\r\nMontague.); ever, with its Cabala and its number, lives on to change, in\r\nits bloodless movements, the face of the habitable world!\r\n\r\nAnd, “Oh, farewell to life!” murmured the glorious dreamer. “Sweet, O\r\nlife! hast thou been to me. How fathomless thy joys,--how rapturously\r\nhas my soul bounded forth upon the upward paths! To him who forever\r\nrenews his youth in the clear fount of Nature, how exquisite is the mere\r\nhappiness TO BE! Farewell, ye lamps of heaven, and ye million tribes,\r\nthe Populace of Air. Not a mote in the beam, not an herb on the\r\nmountain, not a pebble on the shore, not a seed far-blown into the\r\nwilderness, but contributed to the lore that sought in all the true\r\nprinciple of life, the Beautiful, the Joyous, the Immortal. To others,\r\na land, a city, a hearth, has been a home; MY home has been wherever the\r\nintellect could pierce, or the spirit could breathe the air.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and through the immeasurable space his eyes and his\r\nheart, penetrating the dismal dungeon, rested on his child. He saw it\r\nslumbering in the arms of the pale mother, and HIS soul spoke to the\r\nsleeping soul. “Forgive me, if my desire was sin; I dreamed to have\r\nreared and nurtured thee to the divinest destinies my visions could\r\nforesee. Betimes, as the mortal part was strengthened against disease,\r\nto have purified the spiritual from every sin; to have led thee, heaven\r\nupon heaven, through the holy ecstasies which make up the existence\r\nof the orders that dwell on high; to have formed, from thy sublime\r\naffections, the pure and ever-living communication between thy mother\r\nand myself. The dream was but a dream--it is no more! In sight myself of\r\nthe grave, I feel, at last, that through the portals of the grave lies\r\nthe true initiation into the holy and the wise. Beyond those portals I\r\nawait ye both, beloved pilgrims!”\r\n\r\nFrom his numbers and his Cabala, in his cell, amidst the wrecks of Rome,\r\nMejnour, startled, looked up, and through the spirit, felt that the\r\nspirit of his distant friend addressed him.\r\n\r\n“Fare thee well forever upon this earth! Thy last companion forsakes thy\r\nside. Thine age survives the youth of all; and the Final Day shall find\r\nthee still the contemplator of our tombs. I go with my free will into\r\nthe land of darkness; but new suns and systems blaze around us from the\r\ngrave. I go where the souls of those for whom I resign the clay shall be\r\nmy co-mates through eternal youth. At last I recognise the true ordeal\r\nand the real victory. Mejnour, cast down thy elixir; lay by thy load\r\nof years! Wherever the soul can wander, the Eternal Soul of all things\r\nprotects it still!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.XV.\r\n\r\n     Il ne veulent plus perdre un moment d’une nuit si precieuse.\r\n     Lacretelle, tom. xii.\r\n\r\n     (They would not lose another moment of so precious a night.)\r\n\r\nIt was late that night, and Rene-Francois Dumas, President of the\r\nRevolutionary Tribunal, had re-entered his cabinet, on his return from\r\nthe Jacobin Club. With him were two men who might be said to represent,\r\nthe one the moral, the other the physical force of the Reign of Terror:\r\nFouquier-Tinville, the Public Accuser, and Francois Henriot, the\r\nGeneral of the Parisian National Guard. This formidable triumvirate were\r\nassembled to debate on the proceedings of the next day; and the three\r\nsister-witches over their hellish caldron were scarcely animated by a\r\nmore fiend-like spirit, or engaged in more execrable designs, than these\r\nthree heroes of the Revolution in their premeditated massacre of the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nDumas was but little altered in appearance since, in the earlier part of\r\nthis narrative, he was presented to the reader, except that his manner\r\nwas somewhat more short and severe, and his eye yet more restless. But\r\nhe seemed almost a superior being by the side of his associates. Rene\r\nDumas, born of respectable parents, and well educated, despite his\r\nferocity, was not without a certain refinement, which perhaps rendered\r\nhim the more acceptable to the precise and formal Robespierre. (Dumas\r\nwas a beau in his way. His gala-dress was a BLOOD-RED COAT, with the\r\nfinest ruffles.) But Henriot had been a lackey, a thief, a spy of the\r\npolice; he had drunk the blood of Madame de Lamballe, and had risen\r\nto his present rank for no quality but his ruffianism; and\r\nFouquier-Tinville, the son of a provincial agriculturist, and afterwards\r\na clerk at the Bureau of the Police, was little less base in his\r\nmanners, and yet more, from a certain loathsome buffoonery, revolting\r\nin his speech,--bull-headed, with black, sleek hair, with a narrow and\r\nlivid forehead, with small eyes, that twinkled with a sinister malice;\r\nstrongly and coarsely built, he looked what he was, the audacious bully\r\nof a lawless and relentless Bar.\r\n\r\nDumas trimmed the candles, and bent over the list of the victims for the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\n“It is a long catalogue,” said the president; “eighty trials for\r\none day! And Robespierre’s orders to despatch the whole fournee are\r\nunequivocal.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Fouquier, with a coarse, loud laugh; “we must try them en\r\nmasse. I know how to deal with our jury. ‘Je pense, citoyens, que vous\r\netes convaincus du crime des accuses?’ (I think, citizens, that you are\r\nconvinced of the crime of the accused.) Ha! ha!--the longer the list,\r\nthe shorter the work.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” growled out Henriot, with an oath,--as usual, half-drunk,\r\nand lolling on his chair, with his spurred heels on the table,--“little\r\nTinville is the man for despatch.”\r\n\r\n“Citizen Henriot,” said Dumas, gravely, “permit me to request thee\r\nto select another footstool; and for the rest, let me warn thee that\r\nto-morrow is a critical and important day; one that will decide the fate\r\nof France.”\r\n\r\n“A fig for little France! Vive le Vertueux Robespierre, la Colonne de\r\nla Republique! (Long life to the virtuous Robespierre, the pillar of the\r\nRepublic!) Plague on this talking; it is dry work. Hast thou no eau de\r\nvie in that little cupboard?”\r\n\r\nDumas and Fouquier exchanged looks of disgust. Dumas shrugged his\r\nshoulders, and replied,--\r\n\r\n“It is to guard thee against eau de vie, Citizen General Henriot, that I\r\nhave requested thee to meet me here. Listen if thou canst!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, talk away! thy metier is to talk, mine to fight and to drink.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, I tell thee then, the populace will be abroad; all factions\r\nwill be astir. It is probable enough that they will even seek to arrest\r\nour tumbrils on their way to the guillotine. Have thy men armed and\r\nready; keep the streets clear; cut down without mercy whomsoever may\r\nobstruct the ways.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Henriot, striking his sword so loudly that Dumas\r\nhalf-started at the clank,--“Black Henriot is no ‘Indulgent.’”\r\n\r\n“Look to it, then, citizen,--look to it! And hark thee,” he added, with\r\na grave and sombre brow, “if thou wouldst keep thine own head on thy\r\nshoulders, beware of the eau de vie.”\r\n\r\n“My own head!--sacre mille tonnerres! Dost thou threaten the general of\r\nthe Parisian army?”\r\n\r\nDumas, like Robespierre, a precise atrabilious, and arrogant man, was\r\nabout to retort, when the craftier Tinville laid his hand on his arm,\r\nand, turning to the general, said, “My dear Henriot, thy dauntless\r\nrepublicanism, which is too ready to give offence, must learn to take\r\na reprimand from the representative of Republican Law. Seriously, mon\r\ncher, thou must be sober for the next three or four days; after the\r\ncrisis is over, thou and I will drink a bottle together. Come, Dumas\r\nrelax thine austerity, and shake hands with our friend. No quarrels\r\namongst ourselves!”\r\n\r\nDumas hesitated, and extended his hand, which the ruffian clasped; and,\r\nmaudlin tears succeeding his ferocity, he half-sobbed, half-hiccoughed\r\nforth his protestations of civism and his promises of sobriety.\r\n\r\n“Well, we depend on thee, mon general,” said Dumas; “and now, since we\r\nshall all have need of vigour for to-morrow, go home and sleep soundly.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I forgive thee, Dumas,--I forgive thee. I am not vindictive,--I!\r\nbut still, if a man threatens me; if a man insults me--” and, with the\r\nquick changes of intoxication, again his eyes gleamed fire through their\r\nfoul tears. With some difficulty Fouquier succeeded at last in soothing\r\nthe brute, and leading him from the chamber. But still, as some wild\r\nbeast disappointed of a prey, he growled and snarled as his heavy tread\r\ndescended the stairs. A tall trooper, mounted, was leading Henriot’s\r\nhorse to and fro the streets; and as the general waited at the porch\r\ntill his attendant turned, a stranger stationed by the wall accosted\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n“General Henriot, I have desired to speak with thee. Next to\r\nRobespierre, thou art, or shouldst be, the most powerful man in France.”\r\n\r\n“Hem!--yes, I ought to be. What then?--every man has not his deserts!”\r\n\r\n“Hist!” said the stranger; “thy pay is scarcely suitable to thy rank and\r\nthy wants.”\r\n\r\n“That is true.”\r\n\r\n“Even in a revolution, a man takes care of his fortunes!”\r\n\r\n“Diable! speak out, citizen.”\r\n\r\n“I have a thousand pieces of gold with me,--they are thine, if thou wilt\r\ngrant me one small favour.”\r\n\r\n“Citizen, I grant it!” said Henriot, waving his hand majestically. “Is\r\nit to denounce some rascal who has offended thee?”\r\n\r\n“No; it is simply this: write these words to President Dumas, ‘Admit\r\nthe bearer to thy presence; and, if thou canst, grant him the request\r\nhe will make to thee, it will be an inestimable obligation to Francois\r\nHenriot.’” The stranger, as he spoke, placed pencil and tablets in the\r\nshaking hands of the soldier.\r\n\r\n“And where is the gold?”\r\n\r\n“Here.”\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty, Henriot scrawled the words dictated to him,\r\nclutched the gold, mounted his horse, and was gone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fouquier, when he had closed the door upon Henriot, said\r\nsharply, “How canst thou be so mad as to incense that brigand? Knowest\r\nthou not that our laws are nothing without the physical force of the\r\nNational Guard, and that he is their leader?”\r\n\r\n“I know this, that Robespierre must have been mad to place that drunkard\r\nat their head; and mark my words, Fouquier, if the struggle come, it\r\nis that man’s incapacity and cowardice that will destroy us. Yes, thou\r\nmayst live thyself to accuse thy beloved Robespierre, and to perish in\r\nhis fall.”\r\n\r\n“For all that, we must keep well with Henriot till we can find the\r\noccasion to seize and behead him. To be safe, we must fawn on those who\r\nare still in power; and fawn the more, the more we would depose them.\r\nDo not think this Henriot, when he wakes to-morrow, will forget thy\r\nthreats. He is the most revengeful of human beings. Thou must send and\r\nsoothe him in the morning!”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said Dumas, convinced. “I was too hasty; and now I think we\r\nhave nothing further to do, since we have arranged to make short work\r\nwith our fournee of to-morrow. I see in the list a knave I have long\r\nmarked out, though his crime once procured me a legacy,--Nicot, the\r\nHebertist.”\r\n\r\n“And young Andre Chenier, the poet? Ah, I forgot; we be headed HIM\r\nto-day! Revolutionary virtue is at its acme. His own brother abandoned\r\nhim.” (His brother is said, indeed, to have contributed to the\r\ncondemnation of this virtuous and illustrious person. He was heard to\r\ncry aloud, “Si mon frere est coupable, qu’il perisse” (If my brother be\r\nculpable, let him die). This brother, Marie-Joseph, also a poet, and\r\nthe author of “Charles IX.,” so celebrated in the earlier days of the\r\nRevolution, enjoyed, of course, according to the wonted justice of the\r\nworld, a triumphant career, and was proclaimed in the Champ de Mars “le\r\npremier de poetes Francais,” a title due to his murdered brother.)\r\n\r\n“There is a foreigner,--an Italian woman in the list; but I can find no\r\ncharge made out against her.”\r\n\r\n“All the same we must execute her for the sake of the round number;\r\neighty sounds better than seventy-nine!”\r\n\r\nHere a huissier brought a paper on which was written the request of\r\nHenriot.\r\n\r\n“Ah! this is fortunate,” said Tinville, to whom Dumas chucked the\r\nscroll,--“grant the prayer by all means; so at least that it does not\r\nlessen our bead-roll. But I will do Henriot the justice to say that\r\nhe never asks to let off, but to put on. Good-night! I am worn out--my\r\nescort waits below. Only on such an occasion would I venture forth in\r\nthe streets at night.” (During the latter part of the Reign of Terror,\r\nFouquier rarely stirred out at night, and never without an escort. In\r\nthe Reign of Terror those most terrified were its kings.) And Fouquier,\r\nwith a long yawn, quitted the room.\r\n\r\n“Admit the bearer!” said Dumas, who, withered and dried, as lawyers\r\nin practice mostly are, seemed to require as little sleep as his\r\nparchments.\r\n\r\nThe stranger entered.\r\n\r\n“Rene-Francois Dumas,” said he, seating himself opposite to the\r\npresident, and markedly adopting the plural, as if in contempt of the\r\nrevolutionary jargon, “amidst the excitement and occupations of your\r\nlater life, I know not if you can remember that we have met before?”\r\n\r\nThe judge scanned the features of his visitor, and a pale blush settled\r\non his sallow cheeks, “Yes, citizen, I remember!”\r\n\r\n“And you recall the words I then uttered! You spoke tenderly and\r\nphilanthropically of your horror of capital executions; you exulted\r\nin the approaching Revolution as the termination of all sanguinary\r\npunishments; you quoted reverently the saying of Maximilien Robespierre,\r\nthe rising statesman, ‘The executioner is the invention of the tyrant:’\r\nand I replied, that while you spoke, a foreboding seized me that\r\nwe should meet again when your ideas of death and the philosophy of\r\nrevolutions might be changed! Was I right, Citizen Rene-Francois Dumas,\r\nPresident of the Revolutionary Tribunal?”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Dumas, with some confusion on his brazen brow, “I spoke\r\nthen as men speak who have not acted. Revolutions are not made with\r\nrose-water! But truce to the gossip of the long-ago. I remember, also,\r\nthat thou didst then save the life of my relation, and it will please\r\nthee to learn that his intended murderer will be guillotined to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“That concerns yourself,--your justice or your revenge. Permit me the\r\negotism to remind you that you then promised that if ever a day should\r\ncome when you could serve me, your life--yes, the phrase was, ‘your\r\nheart’s blood’--was at my bidding. Think not, austere judge, that I\r\ncome to ask a boon that can affect yourself,--I come but to ask a day’s\r\nrespite for another!”\r\n\r\n“Citizen, it is impossible! I have the order of Robespierre that not one\r\nless than the total on my list must undergo their trial for to-morrow.\r\nAs for the verdict, that rests with the jury!”\r\n\r\n“I do not ask you to diminish the catalogue. Listen still! In your\r\ndeath-roll there is the name of an Italian woman whose youth, whose\r\nbeauty, and whose freedom not only from every crime, but every tangible\r\ncharge, will excite only compassion, and not terror. Even YOU would\r\ntremble to pronounce her sentence. It will be dangerous on a day when\r\nthe populace will be excited, when your tumbrils may be arrested, to\r\nexpose youth and innocence and beauty to the pity and courage of a\r\nrevolted crowd.”\r\n\r\nDumas looked up and shrunk from the eye of the stranger.\r\n\r\n“I do not deny, citizen, that there is reason in what thou urgest. But\r\nmy orders are positive.”\r\n\r\n“Positive only as to the number of the victims. I offer you a substitute\r\nfor this one. I offer you the head of a man who knows all of the very\r\nconspiracy which now threatens Robespierre and yourself, and compared\r\nwith one clew to which, you would think even eighty ordinary lives a\r\ncheap purchase.”\r\n\r\n“That alters the case,” said Dumas, eagerly; “if thou canst do this, on\r\nmy own responsibility I will postpone the trial of the Italian. Now name\r\nthe proxy!”\r\n\r\n“You behold him!”\r\n\r\n“Thou!” exclaimed Dumas, while a fear he could not conceal betrayed\r\nitself through his surprise. “Thou!--and thou comest to me alone at\r\nnight, to offer thyself to justice. Ha!--this is a snare. Tremble,\r\nfool!--thou art in my power, and I can have BOTH!”\r\n\r\n“You can,” said the stranger, with a calm smile of disdain; “but my life\r\nis valueless without my revelations. Sit still, I command you,--hear\r\nme!” and the light in those dauntless eyes spell-bound and awed the\r\njudge. “You will remove me to the Conciergerie,--you will fix my trial,\r\nunder the name of Zanoni, amidst your fournee of to-morrow. If I do\r\nnot satisfy you by my speech, you hold the woman I die to save as your\r\nhostage. It is but the reprieve for her of a single day that I demand.\r\nThe day following the morrow I shall be dust, and you may wreak your\r\nvengeance on the life that remains. Tush! judge and condemner of\r\nthousands, do you hesitate,--do you imagine that the man who voluntarily\r\noffers himself to death will be daunted into uttering one syllable at\r\nyour Bar against his will? Have you not had experience enough of the\r\ninflexibility of pride and courage? President, I place before you the\r\nink and implements! Write to the jailer a reprieve of one day for the\r\nwoman whose life can avail you nothing, and I will bear the order to my\r\nown prison: I, who can now tell this much as an earnest of what I can\r\ncommunicate,--while I speak, your own name, judge, is in a list of\r\ndeath. I can tell you by whose hand it is written down; I can tell you\r\nin what quarter to look for danger; I can tell you from what cloud, in\r\nthis lurid atmosphere, hangs the storm that shall burst on Robespierre\r\nand his reign!”\r\n\r\nDumas grew pale; and his eyes vainly sought to escape the magnetic gaze\r\nthat overpowered and mastered him. Mechanically, and as if under an\r\nagency not his own, he wrote while the stranger dictated.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said then, forcing a smile to his lips, “I promised I would\r\nserve you; see, I am faithful to my word. I suppose that you are one of\r\nthose fools of feeling,--those professors of anti-revolutionary virtue,\r\nof whom I have seen not a few before my Bar. Faugh! it sickens me to see\r\nthose who make a merit of incivism, and perish to save some bad patriot,\r\nbecause it is a son, or a father, or a wife, or a daughter, who is\r\nsaved.”\r\n\r\n“I AM one of those fools of feeling,” said the stranger, rising. “You\r\nhave divined aright.”\r\n\r\n“And wilt thou not, in return for my mercy, utter to-night the\r\nrevelations thou wouldst proclaim to-morrow? Come; and perhaps thou\r\ntoo--nay, the woman also--may receive, not reprieve, but pardon.”\r\n\r\n“Before your tribunal, and there alone! Nor will I deceive you,\r\npresident. My information may avail you not; and even while I show the\r\ncloud, the bolt may fall.”\r\n\r\n“Tush! prophet, look to thyself! Go, madman, go. I know too well the\r\ncontumacious obstinacy of the class to which I suspect thou belongest,\r\nto waste further words. Diable! but ye grow so accustomed to look on\r\ndeath, that ye forget the respect ye owe to it. Since thou offerest\r\nme thy head, I accept it. To-morrow thou mayst repent; it will be too\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, too late, president!” echoed the calm visitor.\r\n\r\n“But, remember, it is not pardon, it is but a day’s reprieve, I have\r\npromised to this woman. According as thou dost satisfy me to-morrow,\r\nshe lives or dies. I am frank, citizen; thy ghost shall not haunt me for\r\nwant of faith.”\r\n\r\n“It is but a day that I have asked; the rest I leave to justice and to\r\nHeaven. Your huissiers wait below.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.XVI.\r\n\r\n     Und den Mordstahl seh’ ich blinken;\r\n     Und das Morderauge gluhn!\r\n     “Kassandra.”\r\n\r\n     (And I see the steel of Murder glitter,\r\n     And the eye of Murder glow.)\r\n\r\nViola was in the prison that opened not but for those already condemned\r\nbefore adjudged. Since her exile from Zanoni, her very intellect had\r\nseemed paralysed. All that beautiful exuberance of fancy which, if not\r\nthe fruit of genius, seemed its blossoms; all that gush of exquisite\r\nthought which Zanoni had justly told her flowed with mysteries and\r\nsubtleties ever new to him, the wise one,--all were gone, annihilated;\r\nthe blossom withered, the fount dried up. From something almost above\r\nwomanhood, she seemed listlessly to sink into something below childhood.\r\nWith the inspirer the inspirations had ceased; and, in deserting love,\r\ngenius also was left behind.\r\n\r\nShe scarcely comprehended why she had been thus torn from her home and\r\nthe mechanism of her dull tasks. She scarcely knew what meant those\r\nkindly groups, that, struck with her exceeding loveliness, had gathered\r\nround her in the prison, with mournful looks, but with words of comfort.\r\nShe, who had hitherto been taught to abhor those whom Law condemns for\r\ncrime, was amazed to hear that beings thus compassionate and tender,\r\nwith cloudless and lofty brows, with gallant and gentle mien, were\r\ncriminals for whom Law had no punishment short of death. But they, the\r\nsavages, gaunt and menacing, who had dragged her from her home, who\r\nhad attempted to snatch from her the infant while she clasped it in her\r\narms, and laughed fierce scorn at her mute, quivering lips,--THEY were\r\nthe chosen citizens, the men of virtue, the favourites of Power, the\r\nministers of Law! Such thy black caprices, O thou, the ever-shifting and\r\ncalumnious,--Human Judgment!\r\n\r\nA squalid, and yet a gay world, did the prison-houses of that day\r\npresent. There, as in the sepulchre to which they led, all ranks were\r\ncast with an even-handed scorn. And yet there, the reverence that comes\r\nfrom great emotions restored Nature’s first and imperishable, and most\r\nlovely, and most noble Law,--THE INEQUALITY BETWEEN MAN AND MAN! There,\r\nplace was given by the prisoners, whether royalists or sans-culottes,\r\nto Age, to Learning, to Renown, to Beauty; and Strength, with its own\r\ninborn chivalry, raised into rank the helpless and the weak. The iron\r\nsinews and the Herculean shoulders made way for the woman and the child;\r\nand the graces of Humanity, lost elsewhere, sought their refuge in the\r\nabode of Terror.\r\n\r\n“And wherefore, my child, do they bring thee hither?” asked an old,\r\ngrey-haired priest.\r\n\r\n“I cannot guess.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, if you know not your offence, fear the worst!”\r\n\r\n“And my child?”--for the infant was still suffered to rest upon her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n“Alas, young mother, they will suffer thy child to live.’\r\n\r\n“And for this,--an orphan in the dungeon!” murmured the accusing heart\r\nof Viola,--“have I reserved his offspring! Zanoni, even in thought, ask\r\nnot--ask not what I have done with the child I bore thee!”\r\n\r\nNight came; the crowd rushed to the grate to hear the muster-roll.\r\n(Called, in the mocking jargon of the day, “The Evening Gazette.”) Her\r\nname was with the doomed. And the old priest, better prepared to die,\r\nbut reserved from the death-list, laid his hands on her head, and\r\nblessed her while he wept. She heard, and wondered; but she did not\r\nweep. With downcast eyes, with arms folded on her bosom, she bent\r\nsubmissively to the call. But now another name was uttered; and a man,\r\nwho had pushed rudely past her to gaze or to listen, shrieked out a\r\nhowl of despair and rage. She turned, and their eyes met. Through\r\nthe distance of time she recognised that hideous aspect. Nicot’s face\r\nsettled back into its devilish sneer. “At least, gentle Neapolitan, the\r\nguillotine will unite us. Oh, we shall sleep well our wedding-night!”\r\n And, with a laugh, he strode away through the crowd, and vanished into\r\nhis lair.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nShe was placed in her gloomy cell, to await the morrow. But the child\r\nwas still spared her; and she thought it seemed as if conscious of the\r\nawful present. In their way to the prison it had not moaned or wept. It\r\nhad looked with its clear eyes, unshrinking, on the gleaming pikes and\r\nsavage brows of the huissiers. And now, alone in the dungeon, it put its\r\narms round her neck, and murmured its indistinct sounds, low and sweet\r\nas some unknown language of consolation and of heaven. And of heaven it\r\nwas!--for, at the murmur, the terror melted from her soul; upward, from\r\nthe dungeon and the death,--upward, where the happy cherubim chant the\r\nmercy of the All-loving, whispered that cherub’s voice. She fell upon\r\nher knees and prayed. The despoilers of all that beautifies and hallows\r\nlife had desecrated the altar, and denied the God!--they had removed\r\nfrom the last hour of their victims the Priest, the Scripture, and the\r\nCross! But Faith builds in the dungeon and the lazar-house its sublimest\r\nshrines; and up, through roofs of stone, that shut out the eye of\r\nHeaven, ascends the ladder where the angels glide to and fro,--PRAYER.\r\n\r\nAnd there, in the very cell beside her own, the atheist Nicot sits\r\nstolid amidst the darkness, and hugs the thought of Danton, that death\r\nis nothingness. (“Ma demeure sera bientot LE NEANT” (My abode will soon\r\nbe nothingness), said Danton before his judges.)) His, no spectacle\r\nof an appalled and perturbed conscience! Remorse is the echo of a lost\r\nvirtue, and virtue he never knew. Had he to live again, he would live\r\nthe same. But more terrible than the death-bed of a believing and\r\ndespairing sinner that blank gloom of apathy,--that contemplation of\r\nthe worm and the rat of the charnel-house; that grim and loathsome\r\nNOTHINGNESS which, for his eye, falls like a pall over the universe of\r\nlife. Still, staring into space, gnawing his livid lip, he looks upon\r\nthe darkness, convinced that darkness is forever and forever!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nPlace, there! place! Room yet in your crowded cells. Another has come to\r\nthe slaughter-house.\r\n\r\nAs the jailer, lamp in hand, ushered in the stranger, the latter touched\r\nhim and whispered. The stranger drew a jewel from his finger. Diantre,\r\nhow the diamond flashed in the ray of the lamp! Value each head of your\r\neighty at a thousand francs, and the jewel is more worth than all!\r\nThe jailer paused, and the diamond laughed in his dazzled eyes. O thou\r\nCerberus, thou hast mastered all else that seems human in that fell\r\nemploy! Thou hast no pity, no love, and no remorse. But Avarice survives\r\nthe rest, and the foul heart’s master-serpent swallows up the tribe.\r\nHa! ha! crafty stranger, thou hast conquered! They tread the gloomy\r\ncorridor; they arrive at the door where the jailer has placed the fatal\r\nmark, now to be erased, for the prisoner within is to be reprieved a\r\nday. The key grates in the lock; the door yawns,--the stranger takes the\r\nlamp and enters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.XVII. The Seventeenth and Last.\r\n\r\n     Cosi vince Goffredo!\r\n     “Ger. Lib.” cant. xx.-xliv.\r\n\r\n     (Thus conquered Godfrey.)\r\n\r\nAnd Viola was in prayer. She heard not the opening of the door; she saw\r\nnot the dark shadow that fell along the floor. HIS power, HIS arts were\r\ngone; but the mystery and the spell known to HER simple heart did not\r\ndesert her in the hours of trial and despair. When Science falls as a\r\nfirework from the sky it would invade; when Genius withers as a flower\r\nin the breath of the icy charnel,--the hope of a child-like soul wraps\r\nthe air in light, and the innocence of unquestioning Belief covers the\r\ngrave with blossoms.\r\n\r\nIn the farthest corner of the cell she knelt; and the infant, as if to\r\nimitate what it could not comprehend, bent its little limbs, and bowed\r\nits smiling face, and knelt with her also, by her side.\r\n\r\nHe stood and gazed upon them as the light of the lamp fell calmly on\r\ntheir forms. It fell over those clouds of golden hair, dishevelled,\r\nparted, thrown back from the rapt, candid brow; the dark eyes raised\r\non high, where, through the human tears, a light as from above was\r\nmirrored; the hands clasped, the lips apart, the form all animate and\r\nholy with the sad serenity of innocence and the touching humility of\r\nwoman. And he heard her voice, though it scarcely left her lips: the low\r\nvoice that the heart speaks,--loud enough for God to hear!\r\n\r\n“And if never more to see him, O Father! Canst Thou not make the love\r\nthat will not die, minister, even beyond the grave, to his earthly fate?\r\nCanst Thou not yet permit it, as a living spirit, to hover over him,--a\r\nspirit fairer than all his science can conjure? Oh, whatever lot be\r\nordained to either, grant--even though a thousand ages may roll between\r\nus--grant, when at last purified and regenerate, and fitted for the\r\ntransport of such reunion--grant that we may meet once more! And for his\r\nchild,--it kneels to Thee from the dungeon floor! To-morrow, and whose\r\nbreast shall cradle it; whose hand shall feed; whose lips shall pray for\r\nits weal below and its soul hereafter!” She paused,--her voice choked\r\nwith sobs.\r\n\r\n“Thou Viola!--thou, thyself. He whom thou hast deserted is here to\r\npreserve the mother to the child!”\r\n\r\nShe started!--those accents, tremulous as her own! She started to\r\nher feet!--he was there,--in all the pride of his unwaning youth and\r\nsuperhuman beauty; there, in the house of dread, and in the hour of\r\ntravail; there, image and personation of the love that can pierce the\r\nValley of the Shadow, and can glide, the unscathed wanderer from the\r\nheaven, through the roaring abyss of hell!\r\n\r\nWith a cry never, perhaps, heard before in that gloomy vault,--a cry of\r\ndelight and rapture, she sprang forward, and fell at his feet.\r\n\r\nHe bent down to raise her; but she slid from his arms. He called her by\r\nthe familiar epithets of the old endearment, and she only answered him\r\nby sobs. Wildly, passionately, she kissed his hands, the hem of his\r\ngarment, but voice was gone.\r\n\r\n“Look up, look up!--I am here,--I am here to save thee! Wilt thou deny\r\nto me thy sweet face? Truant, wouldst thou fly me still?”\r\n\r\n“Fly thee!” she said, at last, and in a broken voice; “oh, if\r\nmy thoughts wronged thee,--oh, if my dream, that awful dream,\r\ndeceived,--kneel down with me, and pray for our child!” Then springing\r\nto her feet with a sudden impulse, she caught up the infant, and,\r\nplacing it in his arms, sobbed forth, with deprecating and humble tones,\r\n“Not for my sake,--not for mine, did I abandon thee, but--”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Zanoni; “I know all the thoughts that thy confused and\r\nstruggling senses can scarcely analyse themselves. And see how, with a\r\nlook, thy child answers them!”\r\n\r\nAnd in truth the face of that strange infant seemed radiant with its\r\nsilent and unfathomable joy. It seemed as if it recognised the father;\r\nit clung--it forced itself to his breast, and there, nestling, turned\r\nits bright, clear eyes upon Viola, and smiled.\r\n\r\n“Pray for my child!” said Zanoni, mournfully. “The thoughts of souls\r\nthat would aspire as mine are All PRAYER!” And, seating himself by her\r\nside, he began to reveal to her some of the holier secrets of his lofty\r\nbeing. He spoke of the sublime and intense faith from which alone the\r\ndiviner knowledge can arise,--the faith which, seeing the immortal\r\neverywhere, purifies and exalts the mortal that beholds, the glorious\r\nambition that dwells not in the cabals and crimes of earth, but amidst\r\nthose solemn wonders that speak not of men, but of God; of that power to\r\nabstract the soul from the clay which gives to the eye of the soul its\r\nsubtle vision, and to the soul’s wing the unlimited realm; of that\r\npure, severe, and daring initiation from which the mind emerges, as from\r\ndeath, into clear perceptions of its kindred with the Father-Principles\r\nof life and light, so that in its own sense of the Beautiful it finds\r\nits joy; in the serenity of its will, its power; in its sympathy with\r\nthe youthfulness of the Infinite Creation, of which itself is an essence\r\nand a part, the secrets that embalm the very clay which they consecrate,\r\nand renew the strength of life with the ambrosia of mysterious and\r\ncelestial sleep. And while he spoke, Viola listened, breathless. If she\r\ncould not comprehend, she no longer dared to distrust. She felt that in\r\nthat enthusiasm, self-deceiving or not, no fiend could lurk; and by an\r\nintuition, rather than an effort of the reason, she saw before her, like\r\na starry ocean, the depth and mysterious beauty of the soul which\r\nher fears had wronged. Yet, when he said (concluding his strange\r\nconfessions) that to this life WITHIN life and ABOVE life he had dreamed\r\nto raise her own, the fear of humanity crept over her, and he read in\r\nher silence how vain, with all his science, would the dream have been.\r\n\r\nBut now, as he closed, and, leaning on his breast, she felt the clasp of\r\nhis protecting arms,--when, in one holy kiss, the past was forgiven and\r\nthe present lost,--then there returned to her the sweet and warm hopes\r\nof the natural life, of the loving woman. He was come to save her! She\r\nasked not how,--she believed it without a question. They should be at\r\nlast again united. They would fly far from those scenes of violence and\r\nblood. Their happy Ionian isle, their fearless solitudes, would once\r\nmore receive them. She laughed, with a child’s joy, as this picture rose\r\nup amidst the gloom of the dungeon. Her mind, faithful to its sweet,\r\nsimple instincts, refused to receive the lofty images that flitted\r\nconfusedly by it, and settled back to its human visions, yet more\r\nbaseless, of the earthly happiness and the tranquil home.\r\n\r\n“Talk not now to me, beloved,--talk not more now to me of the past! Thou\r\nart here,--thou wilt save me; we shall live yet the common happy life,\r\nthat life with thee is happiness and glory enough to me. Traverse, if\r\nthou wilt, in thy pride of soul, the universe; thy heart again is the\r\nuniverse to mine. I thought but now that I was prepared to die; I see\r\nthee, touch thee, and again I know how beautiful a thing is life! See\r\nthrough the grate the stars are fading from the sky; the morrow will\r\nsoon be here,--The MORROW which will open the prison doors! Thou sayest\r\nthou canst save me,--I will not doubt it now. Oh, let us dwell no more\r\nin cities! I never doubted thee in our lovely isle; no dreams haunted\r\nme there, except dreams of joy and beauty; and thine eyes made yet more\r\nbeautiful and joyous the world in waking. To-morrow!--why do you not\r\nsmile? To-morrow, love! is not TO-MORROW a blessed word! Cruel! you\r\nwould punish me still, that you will not share my joy. Aha! see our\r\nlittle one, how it laughs to my eyes! I will talk to THAT. Child, thy\r\nfather is come back!”\r\n\r\nAnd taking the infant in her arms, and seating herself at a little\r\ndistance, she rocked it to and fro on her bosom, and prattled to it, and\r\nkissed it between every word, and laughed and wept by fits, as ever and\r\nanon she cast over her shoulder her playful, mirthful glance upon the\r\nfather to whom those fading stars smiled sadly their last farewell. How\r\nbeautiful she seemed as she thus sat, unconscious of the future! Still\r\nhalf a child herself, her child laughing to her laughter,--two soft\r\ntriflers on the brink of the grave! Over her throat, as she bent, fell,\r\nlike a golden cloud, her redundant hair; it covered her treasure like\r\na veil of light, and the child’s little hands put it aside from time to\r\ntime, to smile through the parted tresses, and then to cover its face\r\nand peep and smile again. It were cruel to damp that joy, more cruel\r\nstill to share it.\r\n\r\n“Viola,” said Zanoni, at last, “dost thou remember that, seated by the\r\ncave on the moonlit beach, in our bridal isle, thou once didst ask me\r\nfor this amulet?--the charm of a superstition long vanished from the\r\nworld, with the creed to which it belonged. It is the last relic of my\r\nnative land, and my mother, on her deathbed, placed it round my neck.\r\nI told thee then I would give it thee on that day WHEN THE LAWS OF OUR\r\nBEING SHOULD BECOME THE SAME.”\r\n\r\n“I remember it well.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow it shall be thine!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that dear to-morrow!” And, gently laying down her child,--for it\r\nslept now,--she threw herself on his breast, and pointed to the dawn\r\nthat began greyly to creep along the skies.\r\n\r\nThere, in those horror-breathing walls, the day-star looked through the\r\ndismal bars upon those three beings, in whom were concentrated whatever\r\nis most tender in human ties; whatever is most mysterious in the\r\ncombinations of the human mind; the sleeping Innocence; the trustful\r\nAffection, that, contented with a touch, a breath, can foresee no\r\nsorrow; the weary Science that, traversing all the secrets of creation,\r\ncomes at last to Death for their solution, and still clings, as it\r\nnears the threshold, to the breast of Love. Thus, within, THE WITHIN,--a\r\ndungeon; without, the WITHOUT,--stately with marts and halls, with\r\npalaces and temples; Revenge and Terror, at their dark schemes and\r\ncounter-schemes; to and fro, upon the tide of the shifting passions,\r\nreeled the destinies of men and nations; and hard at hand that day-star,\r\nwaning into space, looked with impartial eye on the church tower and\r\nthe guillotine. Up springs the blithesome morn. In yon gardens the\r\nbirds renew their familiar song. The fishes are sporting through the\r\nfreshening waters of the Seine. The gladness of divine nature, the\r\nroar and dissonance of mortal life, awake again: the trader unbars his\r\nwindows; the flower-girls troop gayly to their haunts; busy feet are\r\ntramping to the daily drudgeries that revolutions which strike down\r\nkings and kaisars, leave the same Cain’s heritage to the boor; the\r\nwagons groan and reel to the mart; Tyranny, up betimes, holds its pallid\r\nlevee; Conspiracy, that hath not slept, hears the clock, and whispers to\r\nits own heart, “The hour draws near.” A group gather, eager-eyed, round\r\nthe purlieus of the Convention Hall; to-day decides the sovereignty of\r\nFrance,--about the courts of the Tribunal their customary hum and stir.\r\nNo matter what the hazard of the die, or who the ruler, this day eighty\r\nheads shall fall!\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nAnd she slept so sweetly. Wearied out with joy, secure in the presence\r\nof the eyes regained, she had laughed and wept herself to sleep; and\r\nstill in that slumber there seemed a happy consciousness that the loved\r\nwas by,--the lost was found. For she smiled and murmured to herself, and\r\nbreathed his name often, and stretched out her arms, and sighed if\r\nthey touched him not. He gazed upon her as he stood apart,--with what\r\nemotions it were vain to say. She would wake no more to him; she could\r\nnot know how dearly the safety of that sleep was purchased. That morrow\r\nshe had so yearned for,--it had come at last. HOW WOULD SHE GREET\r\nTHE EVE? Amidst all the exquisite hopes with which love and youth\r\ncontemplate the future, her eyes had closed. Those hopes still lent\r\ntheir iris-colours to her dreams. She would wake to live! To-morrow, and\r\nthe Reign of Terror was no more; the prison gates would be opened,--she\r\nwould go forth, with their child, into that summer-world of light. And\r\nHE?--he turned, and his eye fell upon the child; it was broad awake, and\r\nthat clear, serious, thoughtful look which it mostly wore, watched him\r\nwith a solemn steadiness. He bent over and kissed its lips.\r\n\r\n“Never more,” he murmured, “O heritor of love and grief,--never more\r\nwilt thou see me in thy visions; never more will the light of those\r\neyes be fed by celestial commune; never more can my soul guard from\r\nthy pillow the trouble and the disease. Not such as I would have vainly\r\nshaped it, must be thy lot. In common with thy race, it must be thine\r\nto suffer, to struggle, and to err. But mild be thy human trials, and\r\nstrong be thy spirit to love and to believe! And thus, as I gaze upon\r\nthee,--thus may my nature breathe into thine its last and most intense\r\ndesire; may my love for thy mother pass to thee, and in thy looks may\r\nshe hear my spirit comfort and console her. Hark! they come! Yes! I\r\nawait ye both beyond the grave!”\r\n\r\nThe door slowly opened; the jailer appeared, and through the aperture\r\nrushed, at the same instant, a ray of sunlight: it streamed over the\r\nfair, hushed face of the happy sleeper,--it played like a smile upon\r\nthe lips of the child that, still, mute, and steadfast, watched the\r\nmovements of its father. At that moment Viola muttered in her sleep,\r\n“The day is come,--the gates are open! Give me thy hand; we will go\r\nforth! To sea, to sea! How the sunshine plays upon the waters!--to home,\r\nbeloved one, to home again!”\r\n\r\n“Citizen, thine hour is come!”\r\n\r\n“Hist! she sleeps! A moment! There, it is done! thank Heaven!--and STILL\r\nshe sleeps!” He would not kiss, lest he should awaken her, but gently\r\nplaced round her neck the amulet that would speak to her, hereafter,\r\nthe farewell,--and promise, in that farewell, reunion! He is at the\r\nthreshold,--he turns again, and again. The door closes! He is gone\r\nforever!\r\n\r\nShe woke at last,--she gazed round. “Zanoni, it is day!” No answer but\r\nthe low wail of her child. Merciful Heaven! was it then all a dream?\r\nShe tossed back the long tresses that must veil her sight; she felt\r\nthe amulet on her bosom,--it was NO dream! “O God! and he is gone!” She\r\nsprang to the door,--she shrieked aloud. The jailer comes. “My husband,\r\nmy child’s father?”\r\n\r\n“He is gone before thee, woman!”\r\n\r\n“Whither? Speak--speak!”\r\n\r\n“To the guillotine!”--and the black door closed again.\r\n\r\nIt closed upon the senseless! As a lightning-flash, Zanoni’s words, his\r\nsadness, the true meaning of his mystic gift, the very sacrifice he\r\nmade for her, all became distinct for a moment to her mind,--and then\r\ndarkness swept on it like a storm, yet darkness which had its light. And\r\nwhile she sat there, mute, rigid, voiceless, as congealed to stone, A\r\nVISION, like a wind, glided over the deeps within,--the grim court, the\r\njudge, the jury, the accuser; and amidst the victims the one dauntless\r\nand radiant form.\r\n\r\n“Thou knowest the danger to the State,--confess!”\r\n\r\n“I know; and I keep my promise. Judge, I reveal thy doom! I know that\r\nthe Anarchy thou callest a State expires with the setting of this sun.\r\nHark, to the tramp without; hark to the roar of voices! Room there, ye\r\ndead!--room in hell for Robespierre and his crew!”\r\n\r\nThey hurry into the court,--the hasty and pale messengers; there is\r\nconfusion and fear and dismay! “Off with the conspirator, and to-morrow\r\nthe woman thou wouldst have saved shall die!”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, president, the steel falls on THEE!”\r\n\r\nOn, through the crowded and roaring streets, on moves the Procession of\r\nDeath. Ha, brave people! thou art aroused at last. They shall not die!\r\nDeath is dethroned!--Robespierre has fallen!--they rush to the rescue!\r\nHideous in the tumbril, by the side of Zanoni, raved and gesticulated\r\nthat form which, in his prophetic dreams, he had seen his companion at\r\nthe place of death. “Save us!--save us!” howled the atheist Nicot. “On,\r\nbrave populace! we SHALL be saved!” And through the crowd, her dark\r\nhair streaming wild, her eyes flashing fire, pressed a female form, “My\r\nClarence!” she shrieked, in the soft Southern language native to the\r\nears of Viola; “butcher! what hast thou done with Clarence?” Her eyes\r\nroved over the eager faces of the prisoners; she saw not the one she\r\nsought. “Thank Heaven!--thank Heaven! I am not thy murderess!”\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer press the populace,--another moment, and the deathsman\r\nis defrauded. O Zanoni! why still upon THY brow the resignation that\r\nspeaks no hope? Tramp! tramp! through the streets dash the armed troop;\r\nfaithful to his orders, Black Henriot leads them on. Tramp! tramp!\r\nover the craven and scattered crowd! Here, flying in disorder,--there,\r\ntrampled in the mire, the shrieking rescuers! And amidst them, stricken\r\nby the sabres of the guard, her long hair blood-bedabbled, lies the\r\nItalian woman; and still upon her writhing lips sits joy, as they\r\nmurmur, “Clarence! I have not destroyed thee!”\r\n\r\nOn to the Barriere du Trone. It frowns dark in the air,--the giant\r\ninstrument of murder! One after one to the glaive,--another and another\r\nand another! Mercy! O mercy! Is the bridge between the sun and the\r\nshades so brief,--brief as a sigh? There, there,--HIS turn has come.\r\n“Die not yet; leave me not behind; hear me--hear me!” shrieked the\r\ninspired sleeper. “What! and thou smilest still!” They smiled,--those\r\npale lips,--and WITH the smile, the place of doom, the headsman, the\r\nhorror vanished. With that smile, all space seemed suffused in eternal\r\nsunshine. Up from the earth he rose; he hovered over her,--a thing not\r\nof matter, an IDEA of joy and light! Behind, Heaven opened, deep after\r\ndeep; and the Hosts of Beauty were seen, rank upon rank, afar; and\r\n“Welcome!” in a myriad melodies, broke from your choral multitude, ye\r\nPeople of the Skies,--“welcome! O purified by sacrifice, and immortal\r\nonly through the grave,--this it is to die.” And radiant amidst the\r\nradiant, the IMAGE stretched forth its arms, and murmured to the\r\nsleeper: “Companion of Eternity!--THIS it is to die!”\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n“Ho! wherefore do they make us signs from the house-tops? Wherefore\r\ngather the crowds through the street? Why sounds the bell? Why shrieks\r\nthe tocsin? Hark to the guns!--the armed clash! Fellow-captives, is\r\nthere hope for us at last?”\r\n\r\nSo gasp out the prisoners, each to each. Day wanes--evening closes;\r\nstill they press their white faces to the bars, and still from window\r\nand from house-top they see the smiles of friends,--the waving signals!\r\n“Hurrah!” at last,--“Hurrah! Robespierre is fallen! The Reign of Terror\r\nis no more! God hath permitted us to live!”\r\n\r\nYes; cast thine eyes into the hall where the tyrant and his conclave\r\nhearkened to the roar without! Fulfilling the prophecy of Dumas,\r\nHenriot, drunk with blood and alcohol, reels within, and chucks his gory\r\nsabre on the floor. “All is lost!”\r\n\r\n“Wretch! thy cowardice hath destroyed us!” yelled the fierce Coffinhal,\r\nas he hurled the coward from the window.\r\n\r\nCalm as despair stands the stern St. Just; the palsied Couthon crawls,\r\ngrovelling, beneath table; a shot,--an explosion! Robespierre would\r\ndestroy himself! The trembling hand has mangled, and failed to kill! The\r\nclock of the Hotel de Ville strikes the third hour. Through the battered\r\ndoor, along the gloomy passages, into the Death-hall, burst the crowd.\r\nMangled, livid, blood-stained, speechless but not unconscious, sits\r\nhaughty yet, in his seat erect, the Master-Murderer! Around him they\r\nthrong; they hoot,--they execrate, their faces gleaming in the tossing\r\ntorches! HE, and not the starry Magian, the REAL Sorcerer! And round HIS\r\nlast hours gather the Fiends he raised!\r\n\r\nThey drag him forth! Open thy gates, inexorable prison! The Conciergerie\r\nreceives its prey! Never a word again on earth spoke Maximilien\r\nRobespierre! Pour forth thy thousands, and tens of thousands,\r\nemancipated Paris! To the Place de la Revolution rolls the tumbril of\r\nthe King of Terror,--St. Just, Dumas, Couthon, his companions to the\r\ngrave! A woman--a childless woman, with hoary hair--springs to his\r\nside, “Thy death makes me drunk with joy!” He opened his bloodshot\r\neyes,--“Descend to hell with the curses of wives and mothers!”\r\n\r\nThe headsmen wrench the rag from the shattered jaw; a shriek, and the\r\ncrowd laugh, and the axe descends amidst the shout of the countless\r\nthousands, and blackness rushes on thy soul, Maximilien Robespierre! So\r\nended the Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nDaylight in the prison. From cell to cell they hurry with the\r\nnews,--crowd upon crowd; the joyous captives mingled with the very\r\njailers, who, for fear, would fain seem joyous too; they stream through\r\nthe dens and alleys of the grim house they will shortly leave. They\r\nburst into a cell, forgotten since the previous morning. They found\r\nthere a young female, sitting upon her wretched bed; her arms crossed\r\nupon her bosom, her face raised upward; the eyes unclosed, and a smile\r\nof more than serenity--of bliss--upon her lips. Even in the riot of\r\ntheir joy, they drew back in astonishment and awe. Never had they seen\r\nlife so beautiful; and as they crept nearer, and with noiseless feet,\r\nthey saw that the lips breathed not, that the repose was of marble,\r\nthat the beauty and the ecstasy were of death. They gathered round in\r\nsilence; and lo! at her feet there was a young infant, who, wakened\r\nby their tread, looked at them steadfastly, and with its rosy fingers\r\nplayed with its dead mother’s robe. An orphan there in a dungeon vault!\r\n\r\n“Poor one!” said a female (herself a parent), “and they say the father\r\nfell yesterday; and now the mother! Alone in the world, what can be its\r\nfate?”\r\n\r\nThe infant smiled fearlessly on the crowd, as the woman spoke thus. And\r\nthe old priest, who stood amongst them, said gently, “Woman, see! the\r\norphan smiles! THE FATHERLESS ARE THE CARE OF GOD!”\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity which Zanoni has excited among those who think it worth\r\nwhile to dive into the subtler meanings they believe it intended to\r\nconvey, may excuse me in adding a few words, not in explanation of its\r\nmysteries, but upon the principles which permit them. Zanoni is not, as\r\nsome have supposed, an allegory; but beneath the narrative it relates,\r\nTYPICAL meanings are concealed. It is to be regarded in two characters,\r\ndistinct yet harmonious,--1st, that of the simple and objective fiction,\r\nin which (once granting the license of the author to select a subject\r\nwhich is, or appears to be, preternatural) the reader judges the writer\r\nby the usual canons,--namely, by the consistency of his characters\r\nunder such admitted circumstances, the interest of his story, and the\r\ncoherence of his plot; of the work regarded in this view, it is not my\r\nintention to say anything, whether in exposition of the design, or in\r\ndefence of the execution. No typical meanings (which, in plain terms are\r\nbut moral suggestions, more or less numerous, more or less subtle) can\r\nafford just excuse to a writer of fiction, for the errors he should\r\navoid in the most ordinary novel. We have no right to expect the most\r\ningenious reader to search for the inner meaning, if the obvious course\r\nof the narrative be tedious and displeasing. It is, on the contrary,\r\nin proportion as we are satisfied with the objective sense of a work of\r\nimagination, that we are inclined to search into its depths for the more\r\nsecret intentions of the author. Were we not so divinely charmed with\r\n“Faust,” and “Hamlet,” and “Prometheus,” so ardently carried on by\r\nthe interest of the story told to the common understanding, we should\r\ntrouble ourselves little with the types in each which all of us can\r\ndetect,--none of us can elucidate; none elucidate, for the essence of\r\ntype is mystery. We behold the figure, we cannot lift the veil. The\r\nauthor himself is not called upon to explain what he designed. An\r\nallegory is a personation of distinct and definite things,--virtues or\r\nqualities,--and the key can be given easily; but a writer who conveys\r\ntypical meanings, may express them in myriads. He cannot disentangle all\r\nthe hues which commingle into the light he seeks to cast upon truth;\r\nand therefore the great masters of this enchanted soil,--Fairyland of\r\nFairyland, Poetry imbedded beneath Poetry,--wisely leave to each mind to\r\nguess at such truths as best please or instruct it. To have asked Goethe\r\nto explain the “Faust” would have entailed as complex and puzzling an\r\nanswer as to have asked Mephistopheles to explain what is beneath the\r\nearth we tread on. The stores beneath may differ for every passenger;\r\neach step may require a new description; and what is treasure to the\r\ngeologist may be rubbish to the miner. Six worlds may lie under a sod,\r\nbut to the common eye they are but six layers of stone.\r\n\r\nArt in itself, if not necessarily typical, is essentially a suggester of\r\nsomething subtler than that which it embodies to the sense. What Pliny\r\ntells us of a great painter of old, is true of most great painters;\r\n“their works express something beyond the works,”--“more felt than\r\nunderstood.” This belongs to the concentration of intellect which high\r\nart demands, and which, of all the arts, sculpture best illustrates.\r\nTake Thorwaldsen’s Statue of Mercury,--it is but a single figure, yet\r\nit tells to those conversant with mythology a whole legend. The god has\r\nremoved the pipe from his lips, because he has already lulled to sleep\r\nthe Argus, whom you do not see. He is pressing his heel against his\r\nsword, because the moment is come when he may slay his victim. Apply the\r\nprinciple of this noble concentration of art to the moral writer: he,\r\ntoo, gives to your eye but a single figure; yet each attitude, each\r\nexpression, may refer to events and truths you must have the learning to\r\nremember, the acuteness to penetrate, or the imagination to conjecture.\r\nBut to a classical judge of sculpture, would not the exquisite pleasure\r\nof discovering the all not told in Thorwaldsen’s masterpiece be\r\ndestroyed if the artist had engraved in detail his meaning at the base\r\nof the statue? Is it not the same with the typical sense which the\r\nartist in words conveys? The pleasure of divining art in each is the\r\nnoble exercise of all by whom art is worthily regarded.\r\n\r\nWe of the humbler race not unreasonably shelter ourselves under the\r\nauthority of the masters, on whom the world’s judgment is pronounced;\r\nand great names are cited, not with the arrogance of equals, but with\r\nthe humility of inferiors.\r\n\r\nThe author of Zanoni gives, then, no key to mysteries, be they trivial\r\nor important, which may be found in the secret chambers by those who\r\nlift the tapestry from the wall; but out of the many solutions of the\r\nmain enigma--if enigma, indeed, there be--which have been sent to him,\r\nhe ventures to select the one which he subjoins, from the ingenuity and\r\nthought which it displays, and from respect for the distinguished writer\r\n(one of the most eminent our time has produced) who deemed him worthy\r\nof an honour he is proud to display. He leaves it to the reader to agree\r\nwith, or dissent from the explanation. “A hundred men,” says the old\r\nPlatonist, “may read the book by the help of the same lamp, yet all may\r\ndiffer on the text, for the lamp only lights the characters,--the mind\r\nmust divine the meaning.” The object of a parable is not that of a\r\nproblem; it does not seek to convince, but to suggest. It takes\r\nthe thought below the surface of the understanding to the deeper\r\nintelligence which the world rarely tasks. It is not sunlight on the\r\nwater; it is a hymn chanted to the nymph who hearkens and awakes below.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“ZANONI EXPLAINED.\r\n\r\nBY--.”\r\n\r\nMEJNOUR:--Contemplation of the Actual,--SCIENCE. Always old, and must\r\nlast as long as the Actual. Less fallible than Idealism, but less\r\npractically potent, from its ignorance of the human heart.\r\n\r\nZANONI:--Contemplation of the Ideal,--IDEALISM. Always necessarily\r\nsympathetic: lives by enjoyment; and is therefore typified by eternal\r\nyouth. (“I do not understand the making Idealism less undying (on this\r\nscene of existence) than Science.”--Commentator. Because, granting\r\nthe above premises, Idealism is more subjected than Science to the\r\nAffections, or to Instinct, because the Affections, sooner or later,\r\nforce Idealism into the Actual, and in the Actual its immortality\r\ndeparts. The only absolutely Actual portion of the work is found in the\r\nconcluding scenes that depict the Reign of Terror. The introduction of\r\nthis part was objected to by some as out of keeping with the fanciful\r\nportions that preceded it. But if the writer of the solution has rightly\r\nshown or suggested the intention of the author, the most strongly\r\nand rudely actual scene of the age in which the story is cast was the\r\nnecessary and harmonious completion of the whole. The excesses and\r\ncrimes of Humanity are the grave of the Ideal.--Author.) Idealism is the\r\npotent Interpreter and Prophet of the Real; but its powers are impaired\r\nin proportion to their exposure to human passion.\r\n\r\nVIOLA:--Human INSTINCT. (Hardly worthy to be called LOVE, as Love would\r\nnot forsake its object at the bidding of Superstition.) Resorts, first\r\nin its aspiration after the Ideal, to tinsel shows; then relinquishes\r\nthese for a higher love; but is still, from the conditions of its\r\nnature, inadequate to this, and liable to suspicion and mistrust. Its\r\ngreatest force (Maternal Instinct) has power to penetrate some secrets,\r\nto trace some movements of the Ideal, but, too feeble to command them,\r\nyields to Superstition, sees sin where there is none, while committing\r\nsin, under a false guidance; weakly seeking refuge amidst the very\r\ntumults of the warring passions of the Actual, while deserting the\r\nserene Ideal,--pining, nevertheless, in the absence of the Ideal, and\r\nexpiring (not perishing, but becoming transmuted) in the aspiration\r\nafter having the laws of the two natures reconciled.\r\n\r\n(It might best suit popular apprehension to call these three the\r\nUnderstanding, the Imagination, and the Heart.)\r\n\r\nCHILD:--NEW-BORN INSTINCT, while trained and informed by Idealism,\r\npromises a preter-human result by its early, incommunicable vigilance\r\nand intelligence, but is compelled, by inevitable orphanhood, and\r\nthe one-half of the laws of its existence, to lapse into ordinary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAIDON-AI:--FAITH, which manifests its splendour, and delivers its\r\noracles, and imparts its marvels, only to the higher moods of the soul,\r\nand whose directed antagonism is with Fear; so that those who employ\r\nthe resources of Fear must dispense with those of Faith. Yet aspiration\r\nholds open a way of restoration, and may summon Faith, even when the cry\r\nissues from beneath the yoke of fear.\r\n\r\nDWELLER OF THE THRESHOLD:--FEAR (or HORROR), from whose ghastliness men\r\nare protected by the opacity of the region of Prescription and Custom.\r\nThe moment this protection is relinquished, and the human spirit pierces\r\nthe cloud, and enters alone on the unexplored regions of Nature, this\r\nNatural Horror haunts it, and is to be successfully encountered only\r\nby defiance,--by aspiration towards, and reliance on, the Former and\r\nDirector of Nature, whose Messenger and Instrument of reassurance is\r\nFaith.\r\n\r\nMERVALE:--CONVENTIONALISM.\r\n\r\nNICOT:--Base, grovelling, malignant PASSION.\r\n\r\nGLYNDON:--UNSUSTAINED ASPIRATION: Would follow Instinct, but is\r\ndeterred by Conventionalism, is overawed by Idealism, yet attracted,\r\nand transiently inspired, but has not steadiness for the initiatory\r\ncontemplation of the Actual. He conjoins its snatched privileges with a\r\nbesetting sensualism, and suffers at once from the horror of the one and\r\nthe disgust of the other, involving the innocent in the fatal conflict\r\nof his spirit. When on the point of perishing, he is rescued by\r\nIdealism, and, unable to rise to that species of existence, is grateful\r\nto be replunged into the region of the Familiar, and takes up his rest\r\nhenceforth in Custom. (Mirror of Young Manhood.)\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nHuman Existence subject to, and exempt from, ordinary conditions\r\n(Sickness, Poverty, Ignorance, Death).\r\n\r\nSCIENCE is ever striving to carry the most gifted beyond ordinary\r\nconditions,--the result being as many victims as efforts, and the\r\nstriver being finally left a solitary,--for his object is unsuitable to\r\nthe natures he has to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of the Ideal involves so much emotion as to render the\r\nIdealist vulnerable by human passion, however long and well guarded,\r\nstill vulnerable,--liable, at last, to a union with Instinct. Passion\r\nobscures both Insight and Forecast. All effort to elevate Instinct to\r\nIdealism is abortive, the laws of their being not coinciding (in the\r\nearly stage of the existence of the one). Instinct is either alarmed,\r\nand takes refuge in Superstition or Custom, or is left helpless to human\r\ncharity, or given over to providential care.\r\n\r\nIdealism, stripped of in sight and forecast, loses its serenity, becomes\r\nsubject once more to the horror from which it had escaped, and by\r\naccepting its aids, forfeits the higher help of Faith; aspiration,\r\nhowever, remaining still possible, and, thereby, slow restoration; and\r\nalso, SOMETHING BETTER.\r\n\r\nSummoned by aspiration, Faith extorts from Fear itself the saving truth\r\nto which Science continues blind, and which Idealism itself hails as its\r\ncrowning acquisition,--the inestimable PROOF wrought out by all labours\r\nand all conflicts.\r\n\r\nPending the elaboration of this proof,\r\n\r\nCONVENTIONALISM plods on, safe and complacent;\r\n\r\nSELFISH PASSION perishes, grovelling and hopeless;\r\n\r\nINSTINCT sleeps, in order to a loftier waking; and\r\n\r\nIDEALISM learns, as its ultimate lesson, that self-sacrifice is true\r\nredemption; that the region beyond the grave is the fitting one for\r\nexemption from mortal conditions; and that Death is the everlasting\r\nportal, indicated by the finger of God,--the broad avenue through\r\nwhich man does not issue solitary and stealthy into the region of Free\r\nExistence, but enters triumphant, hailed by a hierarchy of immortal\r\nnatures.\r\n\r\nThe result is (in other words), THAT THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN LOT IS, AFTER\r\nALL, THAT OF THE HIGHEST PRIVILEGE.",
